00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,637
[birds cawing]

3
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,654
[Misato] Why did it have to show up
right now?

4
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:11,989
[Ugh] Just my luck!

5
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:13,783
[beep]

6
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:15,659
[beep]

7
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:19,914
[female voice] We're sorry,
 regular phone service has been suspended,

8
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,583
due to a state of special emergency.

9
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,043
[Shinji sighs] That sucks.

10
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,504
Plus I can't get a signal, here.

11
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,547
And the buses and trains
are all shut down.

12
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:34,470
I guess I won't meet her, after all.

13
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:38,182
I'll never make it.
Might as well go to a shelter.

14
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:41,685
[birds fly off]

Oh!

00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,673
[explosions]

23
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,178
[pilot] All missiles have hit the target!

00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:17,137
[blasts]

25
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,517

26
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:25,563
Huh!

27
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:29,900
[car tyres screeching]

28
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,073
[Misato] Good morning. Sorry I'm late.

29
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,032
[blasts]

30
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,008
[Aoba] Target remains unfazed.

31
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,844
It is continuing to advance
toward Tokyo three.

32
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:59,179
[female PA] Air units ineffective
 in stopping the target.

33
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:03,267
This is total war. Deploy all units of
the reserve fourth Division immediately.

34
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,768
Send in everything we have.

35
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,520
We need to crush that target at all costs.

36
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:07,938
[explosions]

37
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,753
This makes no sense!
We got multiple direct hits!

38
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,422
A whole armored battalion
turned to scrap metal.

39
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:36,550
Neither guided missiles nor heavy shells
are making a dent on the enemy.

40
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:40,012
Damn it! We need far more powerful weapons
against that thing!

41
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,348
[Fuyutsuki] Is it because
it's protected by an A.T. Field?

42
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,601
[Ikari] Yes. Conventional weapons
are useless against the angels.

43
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,019
[bleeping]

[card beeps]

45
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:52,149
Affirmative, Sir. Yes, Sir.
We'll deploy it according to plan.

46
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,400

[beep]

48
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,823
Hey wait a minute! Please tell me
they're not planning to use an N-two mine!

49
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,033
Get down!

50
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,619
[explosion]

51
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:16,215
[both react]

52
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:21,136
We won!

53
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:22,429
Well, then! It seems

54
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:25,057
we won't be requiring
your services this time.

55
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:25,808
[shock wave]

56
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:28,769
- [Misato] Are you alright?
- [Shinji] Ugh!

57
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,105
[Shinji] I swallowed some sand,
but I'm okay.

58
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,190
That's good to hear. Now...

59
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,110
Push on three... Three!

60
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,194
[efforts]

61
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,863
[heaving]

[efforts]

63
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:47,204
I couldn't have done it without you.
Thanks a lot for your help.

64
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,998
My pleasure. I should thank you,

65
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,124
Miss Katsuragi.

66
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,376
You can call me... Misato.

67
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,713
It's nice to meet you, Shinji Ikari.

68
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:56,755
Thanks, you too.

69
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,134
- [Officer A] Current status?
- [Officer B] You saw that explosion.

70
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,135
It must’ve been obliterated.

71
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,720
[Aoba] Visual feed is back online.

72
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:04,680
Oh!

73
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:05,764
[crunching sounds]

74
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,686
[rumbling]

75
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:17,484
That was our most powerful weapon.

76
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,654
[groans] I can't believe it.

77
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:21,697
Damn monster!

78
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,115
[car engine]

79
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,869
[Misato] Thank goodness,
my little car is still moving!

80
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,829
I still have twelve months
to pay on my loan.

81
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,540
Would have sucked so bad
if they had totaled it! [laughs]

82
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,917
By the way,
I booked us an express transport.

83
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,003
So! We should make it on time.

84
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,798
Feel free to ask me questions.
You must have a lot.

85
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,383
Mh, okay.

86
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,178
I’m the one doing all the talking,
so come on now.

87
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,971
Oh. Yeah. I'm sorry.

88
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,141
No, I didn't mean it that way, Shinji.
It's just that...

89
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,602
I bet you have
a bunch of questions about all this.

90
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:55,230
Between that big monster
and my invitation, you must be curious.

91
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,316
I am... but...

92
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,985
I assumed you wouldn't give me
an answer even if I asked.

93
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,864
You think through these things
quite a bit for your age.

94
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,282
You should be more carefree!

95
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,450
Oh.

96
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,705
Please, ma'am... Look, I am only trying
to follow my teacher's advice.

97
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,626
OK. Well... Moving on.

98
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:19,588
That big thing back there is a mysterious
enemy creature we call an ‘angel’.

99
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,589
[helicopter sounds]

100
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,137
[Fuyutsuki] The fourth angel.

101
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:30,307
It has a remarkable ability
to regenerate itself.

102
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,769
It is an independent life-form,
fully complete unto itself.

103
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:34,603
It's not surprising.

104
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,773
They are the ones that ate
from the "Tree of Life"...

105
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:40,984
Yes. And so, it's here to destroy us.

106
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,569
We, of the "Tree of Knowledge".

107
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,364
[female PA] Attention,
 automatic doors now closing.

108
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,990
Stand clear of the closing doors.

109
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,409
[Shinji] Special Government Agency,

110
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:50,369
- NERV?
- Yeah.

111
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,371
It's a secret department of the UN.

112
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,915
My father works here, doesn't he?

113
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,459
That's right. Do you know
what your father's job is at NERV?

114
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,838
[bell rings]

115
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:05,926
My teacher once told me that my father has
a very important job protecting humanity.

116
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:11,306
As of this very moment, we are giving you
command of this operation.

117
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,893
- So, let's see what you can do!
- Very good sir.

118
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:15,894
Ikari,

119
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:19,022
it's quite clear that nothing
in our arsenal even comes close

120
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,899
to having an effect on the target.

121
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,193
Do you think
you have a chance of beating it?

122
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:26,029
That is the very purpose of NERV.

123
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,324
So, are you bringing me to my father?

124
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,827
That's right. That's the plan, yes.

125
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:36,957
[whispers] Father...

126
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,041
[train]

127
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,462
Oh, by the way! Did your father
send you any ID cards?

128
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:43,297
Erm...

129
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,631
Oh, yeah.

130
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,176
Here you go.

131
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:48,302
Thank you.

132
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,139
Right... Now, take a look at this.

133
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,099
Welcome to NERV?

134
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,186
This is where my father works?

135
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,146
Am I supposed
to do something here at NERV?

136
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,025
He sent me this letter.

137
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,402
He must have had a good reason
to ask me to come.

138
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,947
I wonder what it is. Do you have an idea?

139
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,782
[Misato] So you have issues
with your father?

140
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,076
We have that in common, you and I.

141
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,290
Oh! [gasps]

142
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,499
Look at that!

143
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,086
- A real Geofront!
- That's right.

144
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:26,632
We're passing above NERV command center.
Our secret base.

145
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,718
The fortress that protects us all.

146
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,428
Our only hope of rebuilding the world.

147
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,432
[crash]

148
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,059
So... Wait a second.

149
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,519
At the station, take the western exit, OK.

150
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:42,189
Then go right at the north gate.
Which leads us to Road 08.

151
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:48,362
Seriously, are they trying to make it
more complicated on purpose?

152
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:52,199
Anyhoo... it looks like
we're more or less on track.

153
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,493
Hey... Are you lost?

154
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,119
I don't know this place very well.

155
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:59,289
Let's keep moving, I'm sure
we're going to get there eventually.

156
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:01,667
[female PA]
 Stage two cooling cycle complete.

157
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,168
[male PA] All crew must exit now.

158
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,505
[Ritsuko] Have the right arm nerve graft
thawed in 3 minutes.

159
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,467
- Remember to collect the apoptosis data.
- Roger.

160
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,470
[female PA] Dr Akagi, your attention:
 Lieutenant colonel

161
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,599
Katsuragi and a young man
 have arrived at HQ, by elevator S 36.

162
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:20,811
She's late again.

How are you, Ritsuko?

You're late.
You should've been here 12 minutes ago.

Lieutenant Colonel Katsuragi.

I thought you got lost.

168
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,411
We have no time, nor manpower to waste.

169
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,537
[giggles] Sorry.

170

Uh.

I am Ritsuko Akagi.

I am the director of Project E,
and NERV tech R & D.

174
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:50,382
A pleasure.

Er.. Me too.

176
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,594
I'll leave you in charge while I'm gone.

Father and son,
meeting again after three years.

178

[Man] Sir!
The target is on the move again.

Behold Shinji.

185
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,587
The artificial humanoid weapon.

186
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,882
We call it: Evangelion. This is Unit One.

187

Mankind's very last hope.

188
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,387
So this is my father's work?

189
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,430
[Ikari] Correct.

190
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:39,473
[Shinji gasps]

191
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,266
So. It's been a while.

192
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:43,643
Father...

193
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,024
Launch the Eva.

194
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,609
What? Right now?

195
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,028
But Eva Unit Zero
is still out of commission!

196
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,907
Wait. You don’t intend
to deploy Unit One, do you?

197
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,617
It's the only option we have.

198
00:10:59,117 --> 00:10:59,910
[sighs]

199
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,245
- Listen carefully Shinji.
- Yes, ma'am?

200
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:03,914
You will pilot the Eva.

201
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:04,664
Uh?

202
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,047
Father... Why did you send for me?

203
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,674
You already know the reason why.

204
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:18,512
So you want me to get inside this thing
and fight that monster I just saw?

205
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,679
That’s correct.

206
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,181
I don't want to do this! No way!

207
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,641
Why are you bringing me here?

208
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,602
You abandoned me
because you didn't need me, right?

209
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,438
A need arose, so I had you brought here.

210
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,942
[sighs] But why me, Father?

211
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,778
Because it would be impossible
for anyone else.

212
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,114
It's impossible for me too.

213
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,324
[sighs]
I've never even seen this thing before.

214
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:40,784
There's no way I can pilot it!

215
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,202
They'll explain how to do it.

216
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:46,998
But... That's...
There's no way I can do this!

217
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,875
I can't learn to pilot this thing, Father!

Come on, I just got here!

230

Tell me, then Shinji.
What was the purpose of you coming here?

231
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,461
You mustn't run away.
Not from your father.

232

And especially, not from yourself.

00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,489
Hmm.
Launch Eva!

325
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,032
[blast]
[triumphant music]

326
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:14,993
[strains]
[beeping]

327
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:36,473
[Misato] Ready, Shinji?

328
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:38,183
Uh, yeah.

329
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,894
Disengage the final safety systems!

330
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:44,189
Evangelion Unit One, ready for battle!

331
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:50,779
Listen, Shinji.
I want you to just focus on walking.

332
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:52,822
Walk.

333
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:01,706
It's walking!

334
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:05,919
Just walk.

335
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,054
[effort] [strain]

336
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,472
[Misato] Shinji, Stay focused!

337
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,683
And get up! Come on, quickly!

338
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:26,731
[strain]

339
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:32,362
Ah!

340
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,780
[Misato] Just stay calm, Shinji!

341
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,657
It feels like your arm is hurt. It's not.

342
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,246
- What about the Eva's defense systems?
- Signal is inactive!

343
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,081
- No A.T. field projection!
- It isn't working!

344
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,795
Damage to left forearm!

345
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,674
Shinji! Break away!

346
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:57,303
Argh!

347
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,515
Fracture in front section of the cranium!

348
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,016
The armor won't hold much longer.

349
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:15,905
[Aoba] Major skull damage.
Severity unknown!

350
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,282
Give me a sit-rep.

351
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,951
[Ibuki] Synchrograph inverting.
Neural pulse flow reversing!

352
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,537
- Shut down circuits. Block the flow!
- I can't!

353
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,664
Eva's not receiving our shutdown signals.

354
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,542
- Sitrep on the pilot!
- Biometrics are down. Condition unknown!

355
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,419
[Aoba] Unit One complete system failure!

356
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,253
Misato!

357
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,255
Damn. That's it.

358
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:35,133
Abort operation.
Pilot recovery has top priority!

359
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,634
Emergency plug ejection, now!

360
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,928
I can't eject.
System's not responding to command.

361
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,263
What? Not responding?

362
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,856
- We have lost control of Unit One.
- Impossible!

363
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,691
There's no way it should be operational!

364
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:54,235
- Is it going...
- It’s going berserk!

365
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:57,822
[whirring]

366
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:15,632
Ah. We've won.

367
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:22,764
A.T. Field, activated!

368
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,683
It's hopeless.
Unless you breach its A.T. Field...

369
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,268
You can't even touch an angel.

370
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:36,069
- [Aoba] Left arm restored!
- Incredible!

371
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:42,033
Unit one is generating its own A.T. field.

372
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:44,243
Angel phase space is being neutralized!

373
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:46,371
No, it’s not.
It’s being outright corroded.

374
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:53,753
It ripped through the angel's A.T. field
like it was paper.

375
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,019
Where's the Eva?

376
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:05,283
That's the real Eva.

377
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,201
Its true nature.

378
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,378
[Yui] Have you decided on a name?

379
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,464
[Ikari] Shinji if it's a boy.

380
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,382
Rei if it's a girl.

381
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:24,552
[Yui] Shinji. Rei.

382
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,220
[laughs]

383
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,807
Shinji. Shinji.

384
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,477
Ayanami.

385
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,729
Shinji.

386
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,522
Rei.

387
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:39,233
Rei. Ikari.

388
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,695
No. Rei.

389
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,947
Rei Ayanami.

390
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:45,948
Rei.

391
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:46,991
[Shinji gasps]

392
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,222
I’ve never seen this ceiling before...

393
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,607
[SEELE 1] The attack of the fourth angel
and its destruction.

394
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:24,862
The requisition of the Third Child
and the first activation of Eva Unit One.

395
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,323
Everything is proceeding
according to plan.

396
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,536
[SEELE 4] The enormous cost of repairing
Unit One was not part of the plan.

397
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:35,581
[SEELE 5] That's a trivial issue compared
to repairing the grounded Unit Zero.

398
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:39,043
[Ibuki] We've completed
the recovery operation of the Eva.

399
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:41,754
Unit One is currently secured
within Cage Number Six.

400
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:44,549
Inspection is scheduled to begin
today at ten o'clock.

401
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,968
[Misato] Any data on the rampage
in the black box?

402
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,971
[Ibuki] It's completely blank.
Apparently, it didn't record anything.

403
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,265
[Misato] It means
we're clueless about what happened.

404
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,058
As for the Eva's reliability as a weapon,

405
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:56,435
I can't say I'm overly optimistic.

406
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:58,688
[SEELE 1] It may not be perfect,
but that's fine

407
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,357
as long as it's effective
against the coming fifth angel.

408
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:03,442
[Ikari] No need for concern.

409
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:06,195
Following
the operational deployment of Unit One,

410
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:09,532
field testing of Unit Two and its pilot
have begun in Germany.

411
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:12,702
[SEELE 4] Production of Units Three and up
must go according to plan.

412
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:17,290
[SEELE 3] Your duty is to make sure NERV
and the Evas serve their purpose.

413
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,041
You know better than to disappoint us.

414
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,459
[SEELE 6] Agreed.

415
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:23,671
Defeating the angels is just
a small part of our covenant with Lilith.

416
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:25,631
The Human Instrumentality Project.

417
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:29,635
The execution of that project
is our paramount objective.

418
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:30,845
[Ikari] I am well aware.

419
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:34,015
Everything shall proceed
according to SEELE's scenario.

420
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:38,561
[birds chirping]

421
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:42,648
[door clanking]

422
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:57,705
[engines whirring]

423
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:02,543
[Ritsuko] An angel's destruction following
its loss of A.T. Field leaves a mark.

424
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:06,005
[Ibuki] It's like the lakes of blood
in the ancient depictions of hell.

425
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:09,675
It's creepy, how much it reminds you
of the Second Impact, don't you think?

426
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:11,552
[Misato] Our Eva can defeat an angel.

427
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:15,473
This should bring humanity the glimmer
of hope that everybody craves right now.

428
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:18,768
And I just got a message
about our young pilot: he finally woke up.

429
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:21,729
[female PA] Announcement for doctor Ugai

430
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:24,440
of the Internal Medicine Department One.

431
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,235
Doctor Ugai
 of the Internal Medicine Department One.

432
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:32,240
Please contact Doctor Azuma
 of the Surgery Department One.

433
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:35,493
Doctor Ugai, please contact
 doctor Azuma, thank you.

434
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:38,871
[elevator door pings]

435
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:57,598
[Misato] He'll be living all alone?

436
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:01,686
[Officer] Correct. He's been assigned
a room in block six, close to HQ.

437
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,688
- Is there a problem?
- No, Sir.

438
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:06,107
Will you be OK, Shinji? Are you sure?

439
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,025
Yes, it's fine. I don't mind living alone.

440
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:10,486
I'm used to it, you know.

441
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:11,988
What did you say?

442
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:15,157
It's no big deal: I invited Shinji
to come live in my apartment.

443
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,993
I even got permission from the top.

444
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,995
And don't worry about it,

445
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:22,039
I promise I won't mess around with him,
I know he's just a kid!

446
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:25,126
Of course you won't!
 How can you even say things like that?

447
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:28,296
- Do you realize...
 - Miss researcher has no sense of humor!

448
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,135
[Misato] Alright!
We're going to celebrate in style tonight.

449
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:35,553
Celebrate what?

450
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:39,098
The fact that my new roommate
has just moved in with me, of course.

451
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:42,560
[phone ringing]

452
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,353
[Housewife A] You decided to move away?

453
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,731
[Housewife B] Yes.
We never thought this city

454
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:48,691
would turn into such a battlefield.

455
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,609
[Housewife A] Well, nobody did!

456
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:54,822
My husband actually wants me
and our children to evacuate, too.

457
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:58,784
I heard that today alone, more than
a hundred people gave their moving notice!

458
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:00,536
[Housewife B] Well, I'm not surprised!

459
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,455
This city is supposed to be a fortress,

460
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,166
but how can you count
on an organization like NERV?

461
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:08,336
[Housewife A] I get chills just thinking
about what happened yesterday.

462
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:09,962
[Housewife B] You're right...

463
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:14,425
[Misato] I hope you don't mind.

464
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:18,262
- But we're taking a little detour.
- Where are we going?

465
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,598
I'll show you something really cool.

466
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,105
[Shinji] Look at that...

467
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:30,858
It's a bit too depressing for my taste.

468
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:32,985
Just a minute.

469
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,279
[siren wails]

470
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:36,447
[trumpets play]

471
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:08,521
Incredible!

472
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,148
The buildings are rising up!

473
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:32,294
[Misato] This fortress city was built
specifically to fight the angels.

474
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,713
This is Tokyo three.

475
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:36,715
This is our home city.

476
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:42,847
And it's the city that you just protected.

477
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:52,273
[Misato] Look! Your stuff
has already been delivered!

478
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:56,861
You know, it's funny,
I actually just moved in here myself.

479
00:28:57,194 --> 00:29:00,489
- Come in! Welcome roomie!
- Oh, thank you.

480
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:02,741
Thank you for having me.

481
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:06,704
Relax Shinji. This is your home too, now.

482
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:09,665
Uh...

483
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:15,546
OK. I guess I'm home.

484
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:17,298
Welcome home, Shinji.

485
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,010
[Misato] So... I know...

486
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,304
It's a little messy,
but make yourself at home.

487
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:27,975
That's what she calls "a little messy"?

488
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:31,312
Oh, hey! Do me a favor!
Put the food we bought in the fridge, OK?

489
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:32,980
Um, yeah, sure.

490
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,983
Ice...
Snacks...

491
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,069
And beer. That's it?

492
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:41,947
What does she do when she's home?

493
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,199
[ping]

494
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,409
[Misato] That looks amazing.
Come on, dig in!

495
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:46,160
[Shinji] Yes, amazing.

496
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:47,119
[gulps]

497
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:54,710
Ah! [laughs]

498
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:58,214
Boy, oh boy, I'm telling you,
this is what makes life worth living!

499
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,673
A feast for a king.

500
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:02,092
You're not hungry, or what?

501
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:05,429
I know it's all microwavable food,
but it's pretty good.

502
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:09,016
No, It's just... It's just that I'm not
used to that kind of food, that's all.

503
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,309
Hold on a sec!

504
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:12,394
I don't like picky eaters!

505
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:14,146
No, sorry... I didn't mean it like that.

506
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:16,440
Not at all...

507
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,276
- This is fun, isn't it?
- Uh...

508
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,403
Just you and me,
sharing meals and conversation.

509
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:24,323
Uh... Yes...

510
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:25,491
Great!

511
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,701
Well, this is going to be
your home from now on.

512
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,329
So get comfy, roomie,
you need to chill out!

513
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:32,289
(uh) Yes, ma'am.

514
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:36,126
Uh! Yes ma'am! No ma'am!
Stop being so uptight!

515
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,838
You're a fine young man!
Grow a spine! Be bold and confident!

516
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:42,675
- Yeah, okay.
- Fine, whatever.

517
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:46,428
Why don't you go take a nice bath? Relax!

518
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:47,972
It’s just what you need right now!

519
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,099
A bath to wash your life and begin anew.

520
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:58,148
Aaah!

521
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:01,110
Mi... Mi... Mi... Miss Misato, help!!

522
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:05,864
- What's wrong?
-The... There's... This... Thing...

523
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:07,116
I mean...

524
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:08,659
Oh, him, yeah!

525
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:11,287
He's a hot spring penguin.
It's a type of bird.

526
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,204
[bird caws]

527
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,755
I've never seen a bird like that before!

528
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:24,592
They were common 15 years ago.
But there aren't many left, now.

529
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:26,218
His name is Pen Pen.

530
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:27,803
I came across him one day

531
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,763
and now he's my roommate.

532
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:32,683
Don't you think
you should throw something on?

533
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:34,560
Huh?

534
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,604
Woah!

535
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:42,401
Maybe I laid it on too thick
 by acting so confident.

536
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,361
He might see right through it.

537
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,740
[Shinji] Misato Katsuragi.

538
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,577
She seems nice enough.

539
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,370
A bath to wash your life and begin anew.

540
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:58,208
But... For me, taking a bath
often brings back bad memories.

541
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,629
[Ritsuko] May I ask how Rei's doing?

542
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,800
I understand you visited her today
at the hospital.

543
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:08,552
[Ikari] That's irrelevant.

544
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,681
Getting Unit Zero back into operational
condition is far more important.

545
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,683
[Ritsuko] What about your son, sir?

546
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,935
I imagine
he must be feeling quite distraught.

547
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:18,896
[Ikari] Leave him be.

548
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:22,483
That'll give us an excuse
to bring Unit Zero back to active duty.

549
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:25,361
[Ritsuko] Then we'll go ahead
with Katsuragi's suggestion.

550
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:44,588
[Misato] The third child gets chosen
 suddenly, and without any prior reports.

551
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:47,925
Then an angel attacks,
 minutes after his arrival here.

552
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:52,554
Commander Ikari
 recruits his own child into NERV.

553
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:56,392
No way that can be a coincidence. Strange.

554
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:59,645
I've worked so hard
 towards defeating the angels.

555
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:02,481
I should be much happier right now.

556
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,653
[Shinji] Another ceiling
 I've never seen before.

557
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:13,867
No surprise. There's absolutely
 nothing familiar about this city.

558
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:15,911
[Misato] This is your home too, now.

559
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:19,289
[Shinji] What am I doing here?

560
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:30,467
[sighs]

561
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:35,723
[Misato] Shinji, excuse me a sec.

562
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:42,229
There's something
that I should've told you:

563
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:45,524
people will thank you
and praise you for what you did today.

564
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:47,568
You should be proud.

565
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:49,528
Good night, Shinji.

566
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,613
Keep it up, okay?

567
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:53,073
[punch]

568
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:53,824
Ah!

569
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,789
[Tohji] Hey, I'm sorry, newbie.

570
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:03,041
But I just had to straight up deck you.

571
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,710
At least once, to get even with you.

572
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,421
[Kensuke] It's not personal.

573
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:10,632
He blames you because his little sister
was injured during the last battle.

574
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,343
Just try to see it his way.

575
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:15,262
That's so unfair.

576
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:17,765
It's not like I pilot that thing
because I want to.

577
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,518
[Kensuke] Hugh!

578
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:25,022
[growling]

579
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:40,579
[Shinji] So much for people
thanking me for what I did.

580
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:44,249
Why do I have to get beat up
just for being an Eva pilot?

581
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,174
- [Ritsuko] Listen, Shinji.
- [Shinji] Yes.

582
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:55,427
[Ritsuko] Every angel
has a component that we call the core.

583
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:58,680
The only way to defeat an angel in battle

584
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:01,099
is to destroy that core.

585
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:04,061
That's what we'll practice today.

586
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,063
Target the core and pull the trigger.

587
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:07,898
[blasts]

588
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:12,820
You need to repeat it again and again
to make it second nature.

589
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:13,570
[Shinji] Yes.

590
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:20,035
Good job, Shinji.

591
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:23,664
- Keep practicing in induction mode.
- Yes.

592
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,757
I'm amazed Shinji would be willing
to go through with this so obediently.

593
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:37,010
Perhaps following
other people's instructions is how Shinji

594
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:38,554
makes life easier for himself.

595
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,225
Target the angel's core
and pull the trigger.

596
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:47,187
Target the angel's core
and pull the trigger.

597
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:51,108
Target the angel's core
and pull the trigger.

598
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,818
Target the angel's core...

599
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:58,073
[Ritsuko] I heard Shinji
got bullied by a classmate

600
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,534
on his very first day of school.

601
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,703
I thought he had
an appropriate security detail.

602
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,831
[Misato] He does. The Covert Ops Division
is keeping close watch.

603
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,749
He was never in any real danger.

604
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,042
We believe it's best for him

605
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:12,045
if we give him
as much privacy as possible.

606
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:13,505
But he lives in your apartment.

607
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:16,174
So making sure
he's operational is part of your job.

608
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:18,135
Makes things trickier.

609
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:21,013
He's much more of a sensitive boy
than I ever expected.

610
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,890
Already having second thoughts?

611
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:25,559
Weren't you the one
who was excited about the whole thing?

612
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:27,019
Give me a freaking break.

613
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:35,485
[Ritsuko] But yes... You might be right...

614
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:38,780
Shinji might be the sort of person
who has a hard time making friends.

615
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:43,076
- Ever heard of the hedgehog's dilemma?
- Hedgehog?

616
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,329
Those things with all the spikes?

617
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:46,413
[Ritsuko] Imagine hedgehogs

618
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:49,458
in winter trying to get close
to one another, to share warmth.

619
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,086
The closer they get,
the more they end up hurting each other.

620
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:57,424
People are like that, too.

621
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:01,219
I think part of Shinji is afraid of
that pain, and that makes him withdrawn.

622
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,347
He'll outgrow it.

623
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:07,267
[girl giggling]

624
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:10,729
[Misato] He'll figure it out eventually.

625
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,982
As you get older, you try

626
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:16,777
again and again,
and through trial and error,

627
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:20,405
after a while, you get a feel
for what the right distance is.

628
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:23,700
I certainly hope so.

629
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:29,247
[Misato] What’s it going to take to get
the budget approved to upgrade the B Wing?

630
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:30,248
It's so Spartan here!

631
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:33,585
[Ritsuko] They're prioritizing
Eva repairs and weapons production.

632
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:35,420
Maybe they're broke.

633
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:37,339
[Misato] But we're freezing our buns off!

634
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:50,227
We got an emergency call.
I'm going. Meet me there.

635
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,410
[Aoba] Direct visual on inbound object.

00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:14,501
Everyone! Battle stations. Condition One.

Ready ground to air intercept.

652
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,007
[Kensuke] Damn, this again!

653
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:46,468
Still nothing but text scrolling across?

654
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,762
Yeah,
it's a complete news blackout, as usual.

655
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,056
Stupid government
wants to keep us in the dark.

656
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:53,350
I feel like we're missing
a once in a life time event!

657
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:54,434
[blasts]

658
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,193
What a waste of taxpayer money.

659
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:06,988
Some people get uncomfortable unless
they burn through ammo at times like this.

660
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:10,867
The government called, they're asking
to launch the Evangelion now.

661
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:12,035
Annoying bunch of jerks.

662
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:14,204
We don't need them
to tell us when to launch.

[female PA] Begin Entry Plug checklist.

[Shinji] Father's not even watching me.
 Why am I doing this?

667
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,799
My only reward is people hating me!

668
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:27,592
[crash]

669
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:32,556
Hey, Tohji, can I talk to you in private
for just a minute or two?

670
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,308
- Why? What's up?
- Come on, please?

671
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:36,601
Alright, alright, sure.

672
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:38,061
[Hikari] She forgot he was there!

673
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:40,021
- Hey, Class Rep?
- What is it?

674
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:42,274
We're going to the bathroom.
We need to take a leak.

675
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,985
Oh. You couldn't have done that
before you got here?

676
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:47,362
[Tohji] So... what's up?

677
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,157
[Kensuke] I want to see what's it like
at least once before I die.

678
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,076
- You mean the battle?
- This is the real deal!

679
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,204
And there's no way to know
when the enemy will come next...

680
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:58,790
Come on, Kensuke, what is it with you?

681
00:40:58,874 --> 00:41:02,586
Please, it might be our only chance!
Pretty please!

682
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:05,046
Just help me unlock the doors.

683
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,256
Okay, okay.

684
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:08,258
You don’t know when to stop sometimes.

685
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:09,801
You just got to do your thing!

686
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:10,969
[Kensuke chuckles]

687
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,555
[beep]
[Misato] Shinji, launch imminent.

688
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,974
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

689
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:20,729
Remember: a burst with the Gatling gun
while neutralizing the angel’s A.T. Field.

690
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,648
- Just repeat your training. All right?
- Yes.

691
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:24,482
And launch!

692
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:25,567
[triumphant music]

693
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:42,959
Oh yeah! Seeing this
makes it worth the risk of suspension!

694
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:44,294
And look: here comes our guy.

695
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:51,760
There he is!

696
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:56,389
Target the angel's core
and pull the trigger.

697
00:41:56,473 --> 00:41:59,142
Target the angel's core
and pull the trigger. Yes, ma'am.

00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:04,231
[efforts]

699
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,444

What the hell?
He's already lost the battle?!

704
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:27,212
He's not done yet.

705
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:28,463
Sending up a spare rifle!

706
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:31,383
[Misato] Go on, grab it!

707
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:34,261
- [Shinji crying]
- [Misato] Shinji? Shinji?

708
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:36,388
[Kensuke] Oh boy...

709
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:39,057
Maybe he's still shook up
from your beating.

710
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,267
What? Just shut up!

711

[Kensuke] It's coming right at us!
[Both scream]

718
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:20,432
[Misato] Shinji, are you alright? Shinji!?

719
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:21,308
Damage report!

720
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:23,226
[Hyuga] Damage minimal. He's OK!

[boys panicking]

722
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:35,488
- Two of Shinji's classmates are there!
- What are they doing?

723
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,874
Why isn't he fighting the monster?

724
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:49,377
I think maybe because we're here?
He's afraid he'll squash us if he moves!

[Misato] Shinji, let those two
inside your cockpit!

730
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,769
Return to base
after you've retrieved them.

731
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:06,686
We'll start over.

reaching the third protective coat.

Now's your chance! Retreat!

738
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:40,720
[Misato] Use Recovery Route 34.

00:44:40,804 --> 00:44:42,097
- Fall back to...
- Newbie, listen!

740
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,473
She's telling you to fall back!

741
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:45,642
Don't run away! Don't run away.

742
00:44:46,643 --> 00:44:47,394
Don't run away!

I'm sorry.

Yes, ma'am.

- Do you understand?
- Yes, ma'am.

Is any of this getting through to you?

Yes. I understand, Miss Misato.

But why does any of it matter anyway?

783

00:49:40,937 --> 00:49:44,107
Missing school already?
He just transferred in, a few days ago.

797
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,234
Nevermind. All right,

798
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:48,194
time for a pop quiz on last week’s lesson!

799
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:49,821
[students react]

800
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,403
[Shinji] OK... I've had enough of this.

801
00:50:31,404 --> 00:50:33,614
You can take me back to Miss Misato, now!

802
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:57,221
[Misato] So, Shinji,
how was your little outing?

803
00:50:57,305 --> 00:50:58,639
Did it calm your nerves?

804
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:06,397
[Shinji] Not really.
Nothing matters. I don't care.

805
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,859
I have no freedom, anyway.

806
00:51:11,778 --> 00:51:14,989
All that's left for me
is to pilot the Eva, right?

807
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,366
That's the only reason
my father brought me here.

808
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:21,287
That's fine. I'll do it.

809
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:23,998
Just as long as that makes
everyone else happy.

810
00:51:24,624 --> 00:51:27,502
[Misato] Forget about everyone else.
What about you?

811
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:30,254
[Shinji] Well I, for one,
know I can't do this.

812
00:51:30,338 --> 00:51:32,632
And I'm sure everybody knows that as well.

813
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:35,927
But what can I do? Ayanami's hurt
and father wants me to be the one...

814
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:39,347
That's enough, Shinji!
Who cares, what others think!

815
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:43,559
You need to decide for yourself
if you want to pilot the Eva or not.

816
00:51:43,643 --> 00:51:45,686
And if you don't, you are free to go.

817
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,480
The choice is yours.

818
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:49,190
It's all up to you.

819
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:58,533
[Fuyutsuki] Apparently your son behaved
exactly the way we had anticipated.

820
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:02,453
[Ikari] Yes, he did. Now, I just
have to push him a little closer to Rei.

821
00:52:03,371 --> 00:52:05,790
Everything is proceeding
according to plan.

822
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,584
[Fuyutsuki] A scenario all laid out
fourteen years ago.

823
00:52:08,668 --> 00:52:09,544
Children

824
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:11,128
with predetermined fates.

825
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:13,881
It's rather cruel, I must say.

826
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:18,928
[insects singing]

827
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:23,349
[Tohji] Come on, just do it!
And don't hold back, OK?

828
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:26,853
We've got to settle this.
Got to even the score.

829
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:30,022
[Kensuke] Sorry. He's big on scores
and that kind of thing. Play along.

830
00:52:30,106 --> 00:52:30,773
[punch]

831
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,024
[effort]

832
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,198
OK, so now we're even.

833
00:52:39,282 --> 00:52:41,576
Sorry about punching you
in the face, Ikari.

834
00:52:52,879 --> 00:52:53,963
[chattering]

835
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:56,257
Yeah, go Kayoko!

836
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,050
[girl] You owe us a pizza if you lose!

837
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:13,900
[Ritsuko] Rei Ayanami, fourteen.

838
00:53:14,984 --> 00:53:18,112
The first child approved
by the Marduk Institute.

839
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:20,781
The first girl.

840
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:25,286
The designated pilot of the Evangelion
experimental prototype, Unit Zero.

841
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:29,123
All records of her previous life
have been erased.

842
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:32,585
[Shinji] Rei Ayanami.
And to save Ayanami, my father.

843
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,004
[Ibuki] Critical error
in activation system.

844
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:37,048
[female PA] Multiple critical errors...

845
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,008
Autonomous rejection
 by central nervous system.

846
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:40,843
[male PA] Neural pulse flow reversing!

847
00:53:40,927 --> 00:53:43,471
[Ibuki] Neural pulse flow reversing!
I can't stop it!

848
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:45,598
We lost the direct camera feed!

849
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:48,601
[Ibuki] Entry Plug malfunction.
The interior array is being pulled in!

850
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:52,355
[Ritsuko] Abort contact process. Emergency
shutdown of circuits one through six.

851
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:54,482
[Ibuki] Command fail!
System is unresponsive!

852
00:53:55,775 --> 00:53:57,526
We have lost control of Unit Zero!

853
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,820
Abort the experiment. Shutdown power now.

854
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:00,821
[Ritsuko] Yes, sir.

855
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:02,114
[sirens and alarms]

856
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:09,246
[Ritsuko] Power cut.
Unit Zero on internal power.

857
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:10,915
[Ibuki] 35 seconds to system shutdown.

858
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:13,209
[Man PA] Automatic fail-safe system
 not activating.

859
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:21,133
Sir, get back! It's dangerous!

860
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:25,137
Pilot emergency ejection system engaged!

861
00:54:25,221 --> 00:54:26,097
No!

862
00:54:32,812 --> 00:54:34,021
[Ritsuko] Release bakelite!

863
00:54:35,648 --> 00:54:36,190
Rei! No!

864
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:42,363
[Ibuki] Total system shutdown
in ten seconds.

865
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:46,075
Eight... Seven... Six...

866
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:50,705
Five... Four... Three... Two... One...

867
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,334
Eva inactive. Full system shutdown.

868
00:54:57,503 --> 00:54:59,171
[efforts]

869
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:01,841
[grunts]

870
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:10,641
Rei... Are you alright?

871
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:12,226
Rei!

872
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,228
[Rei pants]

873
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:17,982
I see. That's good.

874
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:19,108
[piano music]

875
00:55:23,863 --> 00:55:25,990
[Misato] It's hard to believe
it really happened.

876
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:28,743
[Ritsuko] The incident was erased
from the official records,

877
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:29,994
but it's all true.

878
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:33,998
[Misato] If Unit Zero went berserk,
why rush it back into active duty?

879
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:37,501
[Ritsuko] The angels have returned.
We're going to need all hands on deck.

880
00:55:37,877 --> 00:55:40,337
[Misato] Well, sure,
I know you're right, but...

881
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:42,548
[Ritsuko ] We're being careful.

882
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:45,593
We've completed
all the re-activation tests on Rei.

883
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,553
Unit Zero itself is operational.

884
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:51,974
Once neural calibration is complete...

885
00:55:52,058 --> 00:55:54,518
[Misato] They'll be thrown
back onto the battlefield, right?

886
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:03,235
I wonder why Ayanami is always alone.

887
00:56:03,319 --> 00:56:05,780
[female PA] Level three
 cooling cycle of Eva Unit One.

888
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:08,365
Cage Six, shut down systems
 up to phase three.

889
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:11,952
T minus one-fifty until Unit Zero
 conductive systems restart and testing.

890
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:13,412
Synchronization test complete.

891
00:56:13,496 --> 00:56:16,415
No abnormal results.
 No signs of psychological contamination.

892
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:18,834
Copy Caspar's situational data

893
00:56:18,918 --> 00:56:20,419
to Melchior. Unit One’s

894
00:56:20,503 --> 00:56:21,879
plug depth currently...

895
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:23,756
Begin circulation of CBL.

896
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,091
All waste water to be directed

897
00:56:25,174 --> 00:56:26,967
to the Level Two water treatment system.

898
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,761
...as soon as possible. Priority One.

899
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:31,639
T minus 1:50 until Unit Zero
 conductive systems restart and testing.

900
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:34,266
[Ibuki] Roger. Routine check 508.

901
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:36,352
We're done, all systems checked and ready.

902
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:37,686
Thank you, Shinji. Good work.

903
00:56:40,106 --> 00:56:40,773
[Ritsuko] So...

904
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:42,483
Do you like living with him?

905
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:44,276
[Misato] It's OK. I'm getting used to it.

906
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,945
[Ritsuko] You seem a little nervous.

907
00:56:46,529 --> 00:56:49,240
You shouldn't be, it's not
your first time living with a man.

908
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:52,535
[sighs] Yeah,
but it's not like eight years ago.

909
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:54,662
It's not
a romantic relationship this time.

910
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:55,913
I wouldn't be so sure.

911
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,375
After all, Shinji decided
to come back because of you.

912
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:01,085
- You're wrong there.
- Hmm?

913
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,796
It's not me.
It's because his father is here.

914
00:57:05,548 --> 00:57:09,301
He wants his father to look at him,
pat him on the shoulder. Talk to him.

915
00:57:09,385 --> 00:57:12,054
Give him a few words of praise.
Even if it's only a few.

916
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:15,683
I think he needs love.
Cause only love could ease his loneliness.

917
00:57:17,226 --> 00:57:18,561
The kid's hung-up on his father.

918
00:57:19,228 --> 00:57:21,021
Just like you, Misato.

919
00:57:22,565 --> 00:57:23,774
It feels very weird.

920
00:57:23,858 --> 00:57:27,403
Why does commander Ikari want
to keep his own son at arm's length?

921
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:29,488
He's got no problem talking to Rei.

922
00:57:29,572 --> 00:57:30,823
Doesn't seem right to me.

923
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:32,449
That's how all men are, now.

924
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:34,827
They're just
completely wrapped up in themselves.

925
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:38,122
Right now
is not the best time to be a woman.

926
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:40,875
Well...

927
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:44,420
It's late. I need to get back.

928
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:46,505
You just live to work, don't you?

929
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:49,592
By the way, if you're going home,

930
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:52,428
can you bring Shinji
his official security access card?

931
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:54,096
There's a new one for Rei, too.

932
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:56,223
I forgot to give it to them earlier.

933
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:58,058
Can you ask your roommate
to bring it to her?

934
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:01,729
Yeah, sure.

935
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:05,691
[Shinji] Rei Ayanami.

936
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:13,407
Why was father smiling
when he talked to her?

937
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:16,869
Why won't he smile for me?

938
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:49,026
Anybody home?

939
00:58:52,363 --> 00:58:54,907
Hello? It's me, Shinji.

940
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:58,118
I'm coming in, okay?

941
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:35,698
Are these hers?

942
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:41,829
[curtain draws]

943
00:59:44,999 --> 00:59:45,666
[gasps]

944
00:59:50,379 --> 00:59:51,547
I... Uh...

945
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:56,302
I didn't mean to...

946
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:58,512
Ah!

947
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:30,878
Could you move now?
[stammers]

948
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:33,255
Oh!

949
01:00:33,339 --> 01:00:34,840
Woah! I...

950
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:40,346
Oh! Uh...

951
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:53,942
What is it?

952
01:00:54,777 --> 01:00:56,987
I... Erm... I'm... I mean...

953
01:00:58,072 --> 01:00:59,448
I didn't mean...

954
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:06,872
I came here because Miss Misato
told me to. I was supposed to...

955
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:10,042
Oh right! The card!

956
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:13,462
I was supposed to bring you your new card.
I didn't know you would be...

957
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:15,089
[gulps]

958
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:17,633
It's just...

959
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:20,052
Oh right! Miss Ritsuko
said she forgot to give it

960
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:21,428
to you.

961
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:30,020
Honest.
I didn't want to spy or anything...

962
01:01:30,104 --> 01:01:33,107
I rang the bell. but no one answered.

963
01:01:33,816 --> 01:01:35,859
And the door was unlocked so...

964
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:38,821
[door squeaks and shuts]

965
01:01:47,788 --> 01:01:51,166
[female PA] Access to Central Dogma
 is currently allowed.

966
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,961
Category three visitors,
 please use gate number four.

967
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:56,630
[beep]

968
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:00,342
As I said before,
they issued you a new card.

969
01:02:00,426 --> 01:02:02,177
And they told me to bring it to you.

970
01:02:10,102 --> 01:02:13,439
- I'm sorry for earlier...
- Sorry for what?

971
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:20,779
Hey... Ayanami...
Don't you ever get scared?

972
01:02:20,863 --> 01:02:23,365
About having to pilot
the Evangelion again?

973
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:26,034
Why would I?

974
01:02:26,827 --> 01:02:29,913
Well, I heard you got hurt pretty badly
during the last test.

975
01:02:29,997 --> 01:02:32,958
So I was wondering
if you're worried or not.

976
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:39,339
I see. No. I'm not worried.

977
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:42,593
But the Eva could go berserk again.

978
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:44,219
And hurt you.

979
01:02:44,303 --> 01:02:46,388
Or an angel could kill you. And me too.

980
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:49,892
Tell me...
You're Commander Ikari's son, right?

981
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:51,351
Hmm.

982
01:02:51,727 --> 01:02:54,646
Don't you have faith in him?
Don't you trust the work he does?

983
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,649
No! Of course not.
I know what kind of father he is.

984
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:02,362
Erm...

985
01:03:24,593 --> 01:03:27,221
[female PA] Warning: target approaching
 Odawara Defense Line.

986
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:29,181
[Aoba] Analysis of target complete.

987
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:31,266
Pattern Blue confirmed.
Target is an angel.

988
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:33,852
It appears to be the sixth angel.

989
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:37,773
I agree. Launch Unit One
on intercept course.

990
01:03:38,482 --> 01:03:40,901
[Misato] Prep Eva Unit One for launch.

991
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,819
[female PA] Re-checking ordnance.
 All green.

992
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:47,783
[Aoba] Target approaching.
It's above Lake Ashinoko.

993
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:49,660
Eva Unit One prepped and ready for launch.

994
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:50,494
Launch Eva!

995
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,672
High energy readings
from inside the target!

996
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:02,464
What is going on?

997
01:04:02,548 --> 01:04:03,215
Alert him!

998
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:07,052
Take cover!

999
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:28,407
Lower synchronization rate!

1000
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:29,575
Deploy blast shield!

1001
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:55,225
[Misato] Cancel mission!
Initiate emergency recovery of Unit One!

1002
01:04:55,309 --> 01:04:57,227
[Hyuga] No go!
The catapult lift has melted.

1003
01:04:57,311 --> 01:04:59,646
- Status of A.T. field?
- Deployed at maximum intensity.

1004
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,898
Barely enough
to protect the Eva's integrity.

1005
01:05:04,151 --> 01:05:05,652
Aaah!

1006
01:05:07,613 --> 01:05:10,741
[Shinji screaming] Help! I can't take it!
Let me out! Father, please!

1007
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:14,995
Cancel operation!
Prioritize pilot recovery!

1008
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:16,747
Eject entry point now!

1009
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:17,748
[Ikari] Ignore that order.

1010
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:21,168
Once there's no pilot in the Eva,

1011
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:23,754
the unit will immediately lose
its protective A.T. field.

1012
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:26,340
Things will go from bad to worse.

1013
01:05:27,466 --> 01:05:28,050
But Shinji...

1014
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:32,888
[screaming]

1015
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,141
There's no other choice...

1016

[female PA] Second breastplate layer...

1017
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:39,186
Emergency recovery!

1018
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:40,646
Blow the explosive bolts!

1019
01:05:41,313 --> 01:05:42,314
[explosion]

1020
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:04,586
[Aoba] Target has ceased fire.

1021
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:06,880
[Ibuki] Expedite recovery!
Take Unit One to Cage 99.

1022
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:07,756
[Misato] Rescuers, stand by!

1023
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:10,050
[Ritsuko] Priority One:
L.C.L cooling in Entry Plug.

1024
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:12,052
[Hyuga] Pilot is alive! Heart rate, low!

1025
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:14,930
Increase Plugsuit life support
to maximum. Cardiac massage!

1026
01:06:15,013 --> 01:06:16,223
Yes, ma'am.

1027
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:17,974
Ah!

1028
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:18,934
[beeping]

1029
01:06:19,017 --> 01:06:19,976
[Hyuga] Heart rate stabilizing.

1030
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,353
Force eject Entry Plug, now!

1031
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:25,273
[female PA] Plug surface temperature
 has dropped to 300.

1032
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:27,234
- Drain L.C.L from Entry Plug!
- Draining!

1033
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:29,820
[female PA] Draining L.C.L.

1034
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:30,987
Medical team to pilot!

1035
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:37,577
[alert]

1036
01:06:56,888 --> 01:06:57,889
[angel singing]

1037
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:12,487
[Hyuga] The target
is hovering directly above us.

1038
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:14,865
It's drilling down toward the Geofront.

1039
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:18,827
[Misato] So this one wants to launch
a direct attack on NERV HQ, huh?

1040
01:07:19,411 --> 01:07:22,748
I want a report from
all the heads of department in the agency.

1041
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:26,418
Tac report from the first battle suggest
that the enemy automatically engages

1042
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:28,879
any hostile coming within a certain range.

1043
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:32,340
So close combat is out of the question
because we can't approach it.

1044
01:07:32,424 --> 01:07:35,135
- What do we know about its A.T. field?
- Still active.

1045
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:39,431
Furthermore, its phase pattern is randomly
shifting and its exterior shape in flux.

1046
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:41,308
It'll be very difficult to neutralize.

1047
01:07:41,892 --> 01:07:43,310
According to MAGI calculation,

1048
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:46,605
in order to breach this A.T. field
with airdropped N2 mines,

1049
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:48,857
the explosion would have to be so powerful

1050
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:52,360
that NERV HQ would end up being
completely obliterated in the process.

1051
01:07:52,444 --> 01:07:55,447
That’s true. MAGI-2 at Matsushiro
reached the same conclusion.

1052
01:07:56,323 --> 01:07:58,366
The Japanese government and the UN

1053
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:01,828
are requesting that NERV HQ
should self-destruct to defeat this angel.

1054
01:08:01,912 --> 01:08:04,539
Easy for them to say.
They think it’s just our problem.

1055
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:07,375
Don't they know
we're all doomed if NERV HQ falls?

1056
01:08:07,459 --> 01:08:09,669
But ma’am, the drilling is relentless.

1057
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:11,880
Two layers of armor plates
have been pierced.

1058
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:14,466
And now it’s boring
through the third layer.

1059
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:18,804
[Aoba] 22 layers of kakumo type armor belt
plating have been installed so far.

1060
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:21,223
Provided
the drilling speed remains constant...

1061
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:24,226
Estimated time of final breach:
6:54 after midnight.

1062
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:26,520
In less than
ten hours and fifteen minutes.

1063
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:29,856
[Hyuga] Unit Zero still needs critical
calibrations before it is operational.

1064
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:33,401
And Unit One won't be able to do much
until extensive repairs are complete.

1065
01:08:35,195 --> 01:08:37,697
The outlook appears to be rather bleak.

1066
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:40,033
We're short on both time and resources.

1067
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,577
[Hyuga] Maybe we should wave a white flag?

1068
01:08:42,661 --> 01:08:45,664
I'll think about it.
But I just might have an idea.

1069
01:08:45,747 --> 01:08:47,666
Something I want to try before giving up.

1070
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:51,837
Our Covert Ops has a file
on SSDF's secret research, right?

1071
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:52,963
Uh-huh.

1072
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:53,713
[aircraft]

1073
01:09:06,935 --> 01:09:08,103
[Ritsuko] I have to say.

1074
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:12,357
This is your most reckless plan to date,
"Operations Chief Katsuragi".

1075
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,609
Reckless? That's not very nice.

1076
01:09:14,693 --> 01:09:16,862
It's doable before our midnight deadline.

1077
01:09:16,945 --> 01:09:18,780
And, anyway,
we both know it's our best shot.

1078
01:09:18,864 --> 01:09:20,490
[Ritsuko] Operation Yashima:

1079
01:09:21,116 --> 01:09:22,617
as the name implies.

1080
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:25,036
The entirety of Japan
will devote its electricity

1081
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,790
to power a self-propelled
high-power positron cannon

1082
01:09:28,874 --> 01:09:31,418
you requisitioned from the SSDF.

1083
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:34,671
Since the cannon

1084
01:09:34,754 --> 01:09:36,631
is not fully operational yet,

1085
01:09:36,715 --> 01:09:40,427
an Eva will execute
the high precision targeting.

1086
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,304
Convincing the UN Forces is one thing.

1087
01:09:42,387 --> 01:09:45,807
But the Home Ministry and
the Strategic Self Defense Forces as well?

1088
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,686
Well, I called in a few favors.

We're currently laying down superconductor
power lines toward Shimofutagoyama.

1108
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,385
Estimated time of completion

1109
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:06,972
and final connection
to the main transformer: 22:50 tonight.

1110
01:11:07,472 --> 01:11:09,307
Status report on ordnance preparation?

1111
01:11:09,391 --> 01:11:11,351
[team leader] Assembly
proceeding steadily.

1112
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:13,478
We'll have
the weapon operational by 23:00.

1113
01:11:13,812 --> 01:11:15,146
Status report on Eva One?

1114
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:18,483
[Ibuki] Currently undergoing refit
to Type G sniper configuration.

1115
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:20,652
Unit one will be ready in 2 hours.

1116
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:21,903
Copy that!

1117
01:11:21,987 --> 01:11:24,030
The only thing missing now is the pilot.

1118
01:11:24,656 --> 01:11:27,283
Do you think Shinji will agree
to pilot the Eva again?

1119
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:33,331
[Fuyutsuki]
So what about Unit One's pilot?

1120
01:11:33,915 --> 01:11:37,210
[Ikari] The Dummy Plug
is not even ready for the trial stage.

1121
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:41,214
We're going to have to make do
with the current pilot we have until then.

1122
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,550
If nothing else works,
there's always brainwashing.

1123
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:46,511
[Ikari] If nothing else works,
there's always Rei.

1124
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:48,722
You want her to pilot Unit One?

1125
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:51,516
Don't you think
it's a rather dangerous option?

1126
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:53,893
We must win, no matter what.

1127
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:57,105
We need to do whatever it takes
to defeat eight more angels.

1128
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:00,775
I suppose everything depends on that.

1129
01:12:09,868 --> 01:12:12,203
I don't want to pilot my Eva anymore.

1130
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:15,707
Everybody assumes success.

1131
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:17,876
So I hardly ever get praised.

1132
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:21,171
And if I fail, people hate me. And worst,

1133
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:23,923
I'll just die. What am I doing here?

1134
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:28,344
I came here hoping for change.

1135
01:12:28,428 --> 01:12:31,181
I thought things might get better.

1136
01:12:31,598 --> 01:12:33,433
I didn't come here to be put through hell.

1137
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:37,645
Is that it? Are you going
 to live your life running away from pain?

1138
01:12:39,314 --> 01:12:42,692
Me? Live? What for?

1139
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:46,279
I used to wonder
 if there was any point in living.

1140
01:12:47,906 --> 01:12:49,449
No one wants me.

1141
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:51,701
Not my father. Not Miss Misato.

1142
01:12:51,785 --> 01:12:54,287
No one wants me unless I pilot the Eva.

1143
01:12:55,497 --> 01:12:57,916
That's why I have to be the pilot.

1144
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:00,794
Otherwise, I can't stay here.

1145
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:02,921
That's all I have left.

1146
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:05,423
But when I pilot the Eva, I end up...

1147
01:13:05,507 --> 01:13:06,549
[gasps]

1148
01:13:09,219 --> 01:13:10,512
This ceiling again...

1149
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:15,016
Seems like piloting always brings me here.

1150
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:20,438
Ayanami?

1151
01:13:22,357 --> 01:13:23,441
You've been here all this time?

1152
01:13:25,944 --> 01:13:26,653
Listen.

1153
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:31,282
The timeline for the Operation Yashima
set to start at midnight is as follows:

1154
01:13:31,366 --> 01:13:35,286
first, Ayanami and Ikari
will report to Terminal two

1155
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:37,372
at 19:30.

1156
01:13:37,455 --> 01:13:42,585
At 20:00, both pilots
will accompany both Units One and Zero.

1157
01:13:42,669 --> 01:13:44,754
At 20:05, we depart.

1158
01:13:44,838 --> 01:13:47,674
At 20:30,
we arrive at Futagoyama Fortress two.

1159
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:51,386
Once there,
we are to await further instructions.

1160
01:13:51,469 --> 01:13:55,431
Then, when the clock strikes midnight,
Operation Yashima begins.

1161
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:57,142
Here's your meal.

1162
01:13:59,269 --> 01:14:00,979
No thanks. I don't want it.

1163
01:14:01,563 --> 01:14:03,106
We report in 90 minutes.

1164
01:14:04,149 --> 01:14:06,693
So we have to pilot those things again?

1165
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:07,902
We do.

1166
01:14:07,986 --> 01:14:09,529
But I don't want to.

1167
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:12,031
I can't go through
that kind of hell again.

1168
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:14,325
It's so... So scary.

1169
01:14:14,409 --> 01:14:16,703
But I can even run away.

1170
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:19,247
[Rei] Are you scared of the Evas?

1171
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:21,416
Then, just stay and sleep.

1172
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,334
Stay and sleep?

1173
01:14:23,418 --> 01:14:25,837
Yes. I'll pilot Unit One.

1174
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:29,215
Ayanami!

1175
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:31,551
Farewell.

1176
01:14:45,023 --> 01:14:46,149
[drill humming]

1177
01:14:47,859 --> 01:14:50,278
[Aoba] Target's drill
has breached Armor Plate number 17.

1178
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:53,156
[female PA] Estimated time before
 final breach: 4 hours 55 minutes.

1179
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:57,660
Nishihakone Shinsen and Minami Tounosawa
 link-up via Kakuu Route three, complete.

1180
01:14:57,744 --> 01:15:02,373
[female PA] 50,000 volt standard
 installation will begin on schedule.

1181
01:15:02,457 --> 01:15:03,249
Stage four...

1182
01:15:03,333 --> 01:15:06,920
Transformer Group 28 has arrived
 five minutes behind schedule.

1183
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:11,549
[male PA] Hurry with the shunting of
 rolling stock from No. 3 loading platform.

1184
01:15:11,633 --> 01:15:14,344
[female PA] Supervisor,
 please expedite link-up.

1185
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:19,724
Roger. Please forward completion report
 to power link C&C center.

1186
01:15:19,807 --> 01:15:22,560
[male PA] 4th Electrical Relay
 Group’s integrity has been checked.

1187
01:15:22,644 --> 01:15:24,229
All systems green.

1188
01:15:24,312 --> 01:15:26,189
...Stage One power merge circuits...

1189
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:30,193
[female PA] Ultra-high voltage
 superconductor transformer arrays

1190
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:31,527
checked and certified.

1191
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:42,789
[Hyuga] This is the experimental
large-caliber positron cannon?

1192
01:15:43,331 --> 01:15:46,459
[Ritsuko] Assembling it was a rush job,
but in theory, it should work.

1193
01:15:47,168 --> 01:15:48,711
[Ibuki] We'll take care
of battle sight zeroing

1194
01:15:48,795 --> 01:15:51,047
by linking it to the Type G components.

1195
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:53,633
You bet! We're counting on you for that.

1196
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:56,010
I guess the one thing
we can't count on is the pilot.

1197
01:15:56,678 --> 01:15:59,222
But hopefully, Misato can take care of it.

1198
01:16:04,185 --> 01:16:07,772
Hey Shinji, you were supposed
to report for duty a while ago.

1199
01:16:10,525 --> 01:16:13,945
Apparently, you decided
you wanted to remain a pilot, right?

1200
01:16:14,404 --> 01:16:17,073
Then you have to follow through
and actually come do your job.

1201
01:16:18,825 --> 01:16:21,744
[Shinji] Piloting the Eva is really scary.

1202
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:24,163
You people have it easy!

1203
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:28,960
All you do is stay below in HQ
and give out orders.

1204
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:31,504
I'm the one out there, doing scary stuff!

1205
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:33,631
You're all a bunch of hypocrites!

1206
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:43,599
[Misato] Come with me for a sec.

1207
01:16:43,683 --> 01:16:45,727
[Shinji gasps]

1208
01:16:51,024 --> 01:16:51,983
[Misato] Fifteen years ago,

1209
01:16:53,151 --> 01:16:56,362
half of humanity died
following the Second Impact in Antarctica.

1210
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:00,450
If we let the angels set off
the Third Impact, we're done.

1211
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:02,076
What's left of humanity will perish.

1212
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,786
No one will survive.

1213
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:06,831
I know all that.
I've heard it over and over again.

1214
01:17:10,835 --> 01:17:12,003
What you don't know

1215
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:16,049
is that if an angel gets
into Level triple E, below NERV HQ,

1216
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:19,802
this whole place
will automatically self-destruct.

1217
01:17:21,346 --> 01:17:23,348
If we have to sacrifice ourselves

1218
01:17:23,431 --> 01:17:26,434
to prevent the Third Impact, we'll do it.

1219
01:17:26,517 --> 01:17:28,061
Everyone who works here

1220
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:30,563
fully understands and accepts that risk.

1221
01:17:32,065 --> 01:17:33,024
[beeping]

1222
01:17:35,109 --> 01:17:36,069
[ping]

1223
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:47,914
[gasps]

1224
01:17:49,082 --> 01:17:49,832
I can’t believe it.

1225
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:52,960
It can't be...

1226
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:54,837
An Eva?

1227
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:59,258
[Misato] It's not.
This being brought life to our planet...

1228
01:17:59,342 --> 01:18:01,594
And it could be
the agent of its extinction.

1229
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:04,639
This is the second angel, Lilith.

1230
01:18:04,722 --> 01:18:07,225
- Lilith?
- Yes.

1231
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:10,645
Yes. Some believe
it can trigger the Third Impact.

1232
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:12,772
You need to guard Lilith

1233
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:14,524
by piloting the Eva.

1234
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:16,651
You are the only person who can do it.

1235
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:19,987
Shinji, we are entrusting
the future of humanity

1236
01:18:20,071 --> 01:18:21,572
to you and to your Eva.

1237
01:18:22,448 --> 01:18:25,993
All that responsibility.
Why does it have to be me?

1238
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:28,329
There's no specific reason.

1239
01:18:28,413 --> 01:18:30,373
Actually, fate chose you, Shinji.

1240
01:18:31,499 --> 01:18:32,792
But, you know,

1241
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:35,878
you're not the only one
who's putting his life on the line.

1242
01:18:37,296 --> 01:18:38,589
We all are.

1243
01:18:43,136 --> 01:18:46,139
I'll do it, Misato. I'll pilot my Eva.

1244
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:51,602
[humming]

1245
01:19:00,695 --> 01:19:04,657
Right. I will now inform you
of your roles in this operation.

1246
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,409
- Shinji.
- Yes, ma'am.

1247
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:09,370
- You will be the gunner in Unit One.
- Yes, ma'am.

1248
01:19:09,454 --> 01:19:11,914
Rei, you will be in charge of defense
in Unit Zero.

1249
01:19:12,623 --> 01:19:13,207
Yes, ma'am.

1250
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:17,044
To succeed, this operation
requires an extreme level of precision.

1251
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:20,548
For that reason
and because Unit Zero needs calibration,

1252
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:23,593
we chose Unit One as gunner,
even though it's not fully repaired.

1253
01:19:23,926 --> 01:19:25,595
So listen carefully, Shinji.

1254
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:27,763
Positrons are affected by many factors:

1255
01:19:27,847 --> 01:19:31,434
gravity, the rotation of the Earth,
its magnetic field.

1256
01:19:31,517 --> 01:19:34,061
You have to take all that into account.

1257
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:37,398
Target the core
and deliver a precise shot in the middle.

1258
01:19:37,482 --> 01:19:40,109
Easy to say,
but we can't even see where the core is.

1259
01:19:40,693 --> 01:19:45,490
[Ritsuko] Don't worry. Part of the angel
materializes during its attack phase.

1260
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:48,868
We believe that's where its core is.

1261
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:51,871
We will identify the targeting specifics
and supply you

1262
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:53,539
with the firing solution.

1263
01:19:54,332 --> 01:19:56,209
Just follow the instructions on screen.

1264
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:59,712
Then when the crosshairs
line up in the center, you just shoot.

1265
01:20:00,588 --> 01:20:02,298
The machine will do the rest.

1266
01:20:02,882 --> 01:20:04,258
But there's a catch:

1267
01:20:04,342 --> 01:20:06,969
only one location has been set up
to receive all the power up

1268
01:20:07,053 --> 01:20:09,931
for the massive electrical discharge.

1269
01:20:10,598 --> 01:20:13,643
For that reason,
Unit One's firing position is fixed.

1270
01:20:14,393 --> 01:20:16,354
So retreat will not be an option?

1271
01:20:16,437 --> 01:20:18,606
- Correct.
- But what...

1272
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:20,650
What if I miss and the angel shoots back?

1273
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:22,818
Don't think about that for now.

1274
01:20:22,902 --> 01:20:25,571
Focus on your job
and hit the enemy with your first shot.

1275
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:28,699
So... Hit the target,
or we're in big trouble?

1276
01:20:29,534 --> 01:20:30,201
[Rei] So I...

1277
01:20:31,244 --> 01:20:33,663
- I'm supposed to protect Unit One?
- Yes.

1278
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:34,997
Understood.

1279
01:20:35,915 --> 01:20:38,334
[Misato] It's time.
Get ready, both of you.

1280
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:39,085
[Rei and Shinji] Yes, ma'am.

1281
01:20:48,052 --> 01:20:49,178
[Shinji] You know...

1282
01:20:51,681 --> 01:20:54,350
You know... we could die tonight.

1283
01:20:56,686 --> 01:20:57,395
No, Shinji.

1284
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:00,189
You won't die.

1285
01:21:01,691 --> 01:21:03,025
I will protect you.

1286
01:21:09,407 --> 01:21:11,826
I don't feel I'm worth protecting.

1287
01:21:12,743 --> 01:21:15,288
[Misato] Here's a message
left with HQ public affairs.

1288
01:21:15,705 --> 01:21:16,539

 Hey Shinji, I'm counting on you.

[string music]

Tell me, Ayanami.
Why do you pilot your Eva?

1300
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:29,737
Because it's my link.

1301
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:34,450
- It's your link?
- Yes, my link.

1302
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:39,872
- You mean, to my father?
- To everyone.

1303
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:43,292
You sure are tough, Rei Ayanami.

1304
01:22:45,252 --> 01:22:47,421
It's just that... this is all I have.

1305
01:22:49,382 --> 01:22:51,801
It's time. Let's go.

1306
01:22:55,429 --> 01:22:56,097

- Listen Shinji.

1311
01:23:17,284 --> 01:23:21,080
You chose to get back in the Eva.
If for only just that, I am grateful.

1312
01:23:21,706 --> 01:23:22,665

1419
01:29:11,472 --> 01:29:12,473
I'm counting on you.

1420
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:14,224
[Kensuke] Ikari. Go get 'em.

1421
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:33,869
[Misato] I'm begging you, sir.
Have faith in your son.

1422
01:29:41,418 --> 01:29:44,004
I assure you
I do have faith in him right now.

1423
01:29:47,216 --> 01:29:50,052
As you wish. You can carry on.

1424
01:29:50,135 --> 01:29:51,136
Thank you, sir.

1425
01:29:52,554 --> 01:29:54,681
- Shinji.
- Yes, ma'am.

1426
01:29:54,765 --> 01:29:57,643
We're going to entrust you
with all the energy produced in Japan.

1427
01:29:58,352 --> 01:30:01,605
With our hope, all humanity's future

1428
01:30:01,688 --> 01:30:03,982
and the future of all living things
that've survived...

1429
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:06,110
It's all up to you, now.

1430
01:30:06,944 --> 01:30:09,071
- Go for it.
- Yes, ma'am.

[Aoba] Enemy drill has breached
point zero, directly above HQ!

1436
01:30:29,675 --> 01:30:30,926
Ready the second shot now!

1437
01:30:32,845 --> 01:30:35,264

01:30:40,185 --> 01:30:42,271
Cooling subsystem pressure
 is exceeding max limit.

1441
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:44,773
[Ibuki] Final firing solution
data input complete.

1442

1443
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:51,155
[male PA] Firing threshold reached
 in zero point two.

1444
01:30:51,655 --> 01:30:53,615
[Ibuki] High energy readings
from target again!

1445
01:30:54,074 --> 01:30:54,825
Damn it!

1446
01:30:55,242 --> 01:30:56,243
[gasps]

1447
01:30:56,326 --> 01:30:57,286
[explosion]

1448
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:04,501

[blast]

1453
01:31:22,686 --> 01:31:23,562
Shield is breaking up!

1454
01:31:23,645 --> 01:31:24,354
How long can it hold?

1455
01:31:24,438 --> 01:31:25,355
Twenty seconds!

1456
01:31:26,315 --> 01:31:27,733
[Shinji] Come on!

1457
01:31:35,032 --> 01:31:37,034
[Shinji] Come on! Come on!

1458
01:31:39,912 --> 01:31:40,829
Come on!

1459

[angel screaming]

1460
01:32:12,819 --> 01:32:13,695
We did it!

1461
01:32:30,712 --> 01:32:32,256
[rain]

[crashing, broken glass]

1464
01:32:44,726 --> 01:32:45,602
Ayanami!

1465
01:32:50,732 --> 01:32:52,484
Ayanami?

1466
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,882
[efforts]

Ayanami!

1470
01:33:25,892 --> 01:33:28,270
Are you OK? Ayanami? Ayanami!

1471
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:38,405
[sighs]

1472
01:33:39,489 --> 01:33:43,493
I never want to hear you say things like,
like: "This is all I have."

1473
01:33:46,496 --> 01:33:48,582
And I never want
to hear you say "farewell",

1474
01:33:48,665 --> 01:33:50,667
like we're never going
to see each other again.

1475
01:33:51,043 --> 01:33:53,045
[crying]

1476
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:01,970
Shinji... Why are you crying?

1477
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:06,725
I'm sorry.

1478
01:34:06,808 --> 01:34:10,270
But I don't know
how I should act at a time like this.

1479
01:34:10,854 --> 01:34:13,648
You could smile... that would be good.

1480
01:34:14,066 --> 01:34:14,858
[gasps]

1481
01:34:43,929 --> 01:34:44,596
[gasps]

1482
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:55,774
[Kaworu] I know.
The boy down there has awakened,

1483
01:34:55,857 --> 01:34:57,984
and is now
in the generalization stage, right?

1484
01:34:59,069 --> 01:35:03,698
[Kiel] Yes.
The Dead Sea Scrolls Apocrypha have
been fulfilled up to the Book of Codes.

1485
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:07,077
The time of the pact draws near.

1486
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:12,541
Number three again?

1487
01:35:12,624 --> 01:35:14,459
You don't change, do you?

1488
01:35:15,961 --> 01:35:17,462
I'm looking forward to meeting you,

1489
01:35:18,338 --> 01:35:19,548
Shinji Ikari.

1490
01:35:29,307 --> 01:35:31,476

01:40:29,774 --> 01:40:32,444
The forced activation test
 of Eva Unit Three.

1495
01:40:32,527 --> 01:40:36,197
And Eva Unit Six and its pilot
 descend from the Moon.

1496
01:40:36,990 --> 01:40:39,993
Our story unfolds and Shinji unravels.

1497
01:40:40,076 --> 01:40:41,953
How long can it last?

1498
01:40:42,662 --> 01:40:45,081
Don't miss: Evangelion two

1499
01:40:45,165 --> 01:40:46,166
point twenty-two!

1500
01:40:46,249 --> 01:40:49,919
Get ready for all that,
 plus many surprises, coming up!
