1
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,698
Number 4, locked in.

2
00:01:24,906 --> 00:01:25,485
Roger!

3
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:28,157
Number 2 here, also locked in.

4
00:01:28,236 --> 00:01:29,284
Roger, Number 2.

5
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:30,875
Number 3, locked in.

6
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:32,598
Number 1, locked in.

7
00:01:32,623 --> 00:01:33,722
Roger that, both.

8
00:01:33,946 --> 00:01:36,517
All right, Inspector,
all the cars have been deployed!

9
00:01:36,542 --> 00:01:37,164
Mm.

10
00:01:37,405 --> 00:01:40,027
Advance squad,
how is it inside?

11
00:01:40,442 --> 00:01:41,807
You called it, Inspector.

12
00:01:42,006 --> 00:01:44,240
The whole security system's
been taken out.

13
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:45,526
And the diamond?

14
00:01:46,076 --> 00:01:48,717
It's gone!
He snatched it from the case!

15
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,277
This is Team B.

16
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,826
No targets descending
from the emergency stairs.

17
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:53,882
We're heading up.

18
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:56,042
Don't concern yourself
with whispering.

19
00:01:56,067 --> 00:01:58,371
Just assume you'll be
driving him to the roof.

20
00:01:58,616 --> 00:01:59,286
Roger.

21
00:01:59,310 --> 00:01:59,872
Right.

22
00:01:59,897 --> 00:02:01,839
Now let's go over
the plan again.

23
00:02:02,173 --> 00:02:03,547
Wherever he jumps out,

24
00:02:03,572 --> 00:02:07,844
we'll blow him into the Tsukishima River
with the jet stream from the four cars in place

25
00:02:08,153 --> 00:02:11,441
and then scoop him out like the
fishy little ne'er-do-well he is.

26
00:02:11,476 --> 00:02:14,080
He's not getting away today,
no, sirree!

27
00:02:14,118 --> 00:02:15,980
Do you think
he'll be taken in that easily?

28
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,900
There's a good chance he'll fight
back with that card gun of his.

29
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:22,202
They're tough little suckers,
but they're still just cards.

30
00:02:22,227 --> 00:02:24,308
They're no match
for wind power!

31
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:28,253
All he can do is hang from that
glider-cape of his and shoot those cards.

32
00:02:28,407 --> 00:02:31,483
Kid has style,
but wind is his weakness!

33
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,474
Kid! Kid! Kid!

34
00:02:35,526 --> 00:02:39,090
Kid! Kid! Kid! Kid!

35
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,494
Kid! Kid! Kid!

36
00:02:40,518 --> 00:02:41,212
Inspector!

37
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,449
Hmm? So there you are, Kid!

38
00:02:43,474 --> 00:02:44,918
Everyone get in position!

39
00:02:44,942 --> 00:02:45,434
Sir!

40
00:02:51,128 --> 00:02:53,675
This diamond and I
will be leaving now.

41
00:02:59,306 --> 00:03:00,755
Who's the knockoff?

42
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,777
Commence operation. Capture Kid!

43
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,830
All cars, start your turbines!

44
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,570
He's heading east!

45
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:19,806
Numbers Two and Four,
Pattern B!

46
00:03:26,726 --> 00:03:27,789
We got him!

47
00:03:30,426 --> 00:03:31,839
What have we here?

48
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,316
Too stunned
to use your kite, Kid?

49
00:03:34,436 --> 00:03:36,633
Fifty meters
to Tsukishima River!

50
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:40,365
Tsukishima River
capture squad, bring it up!

51
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,345
Hmm.

52
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:56,634
Kid fired a gun!

53
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:58,140
Live rounds fired!

54
00:03:58,626 --> 00:04:01,164
Kid has an actual handgun?

55
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,853
Yahoo!

56
00:04:06,303 --> 00:04:10,072
Kid is using the pleasure boats
to escape up the Tsukishima River!

57
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:11,845
Can't we use a chopper?

58
00:04:12,075 --> 00:04:14,371
We didn't prep any
for this operation!

59
00:04:14,532 --> 00:04:16,916
He shot off a live round?

60
00:04:16,941 --> 00:04:17,488
we can use instead!

61
00:04:17,556 --> 00:04:18,769
Coming through!

62
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,303
Move that damn fishing net
out of the way!

63
00:04:21,383 --> 00:04:23,610
We can't pursue him
any farther!

64
00:04:32,859 --> 00:04:33,470
Huh?

65
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,366
Hold it, Kid!

66
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:40,256
Ah.

67
00:04:47,886 --> 00:04:49,023
No, you don't!

68
00:04:58,936 --> 00:05:01,282
Should have known
that'd be too easy.

69
00:06:34,616 --> 00:06:35,925
Zantetsuken.

70
00:06:42,558 --> 00:06:43,665
How about that?

71
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,403
You should have said so
from the start...

72
00:06:54,642 --> 00:06:56,254
...Lupin III.

73
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:15,450
He's Lupin III, a world traveler who
obtains anything he targets using his skills

74
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:18,190
as a master phantom thief.

75
00:07:18,537 --> 00:07:20,555
His partner's Daisuke Jigen.

76
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:23,975
He's a professional
with a .3-second quick draw,

77
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,959
a cool gunman
with a strong sense of duty.

78
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,762
Goemon Ishikawa XIII.

79
00:07:30,797 --> 00:07:32,967
With his mastery
of sword-drawing,

80
00:07:33,046 --> 00:07:34,887
he can slice anything in two,

81
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,770
making him a man
you don't want to cross.

82
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:41,627
And there's one more...

83
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,097
the mysterious Fujiko Mine.

84
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:46,986
Is she a pirate, a spy?

85
00:07:47,073 --> 00:07:48,934
Not even Lupin knows.

86
00:07:49,241 --> 00:07:51,225
With all the trouble
she gets him into,

87
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:53,635
I don't know why
he keeps her in the gang.

88
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,790
Lupin has a weakness
for cute girls.

89
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,823
Figures.

90
00:08:04,453 --> 00:08:07,309
The high school
detective, Shinichi Kudo.

91
00:08:07,817 --> 00:08:11,820
While at a theme park with his
childhood friend and classmate Ran Mori,

92
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:16,377
he witnessed a shady business deal
between a pair of scary-looking men in black.

93
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:19,555
But he was so distracted
by the guys in front of him

94
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,260
that he didn't notice one of their
partners sneaking up from behind.

95
00:08:23,677 --> 00:08:25,978
The man forced
some poison down his gullet,

96
00:08:26,003 --> 00:08:28,945
and he awoke to the surprise
to end all surprises!

97
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,829
He discovered
that his body had shrunk.

98
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:35,638
If those no-goodniks got wind
Shinichi Kudo was still alive,

99
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,540
his life and the lives of his loved ones
would be in jeopardy, so to hide his identity

100
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:44,024
he took on
the name Conan Edogawa.

101
00:08:44,644 --> 00:08:49,356
He now lives with Ran and her father,
who happens to be a private detective.

102
00:08:52,603 --> 00:08:53,673
Oh, forget it.

103
00:08:53,747 --> 00:08:55,552
I'll just have
to ask Kid instead.

104
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:56,985
Wha... Kid?

105
00:08:57,176 --> 00:08:59,296
Kid the Phantom Thief. Heard of him?

106
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,484
Sure, I have!

107
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:03,225
They call the sneaky bastard
the Moonlight Magician,

108
00:09:03,296 --> 00:09:05,134
but he's still
just a high-school brat.

109
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:08,554
Wonderful!
You gotta tell me where he is!

110
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:11,425
Come on, Lupin. Which
high school does he go to?

111
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,893
I stole it as Kid,
just like you wanted me to.

112
00:09:22,465 --> 00:09:23,697
Evening, Lupin.

113
00:09:24,137 --> 00:09:26,577
That was quite the show
you put on back there.

114
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,635
You knowing it was me
saves us a lot of time.

115
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:32,040
You can cancel
the detonation code now.

116
00:09:32,437 --> 00:09:34,370
Sorry. 'Fraid I can't.

117
00:09:34,395 --> 00:09:35,745
What do you mean?

118
00:09:35,893 --> 00:09:39,595
Well, it's just that you say
you'll serve me if I spare this woman,

119
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,128
but can you really be trusted?

120
00:09:42,322 --> 00:09:43,538
A test, huh?

121
00:09:43,734 --> 00:09:44,946
Apologies.

122
00:09:44,993 --> 00:09:48,283
You come highly recommended
by a certain acquaintance.

123
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:53,360
He said Lupin III was the only thief
capable of stealing the Cherry Sapphire.

124
00:09:53,954 --> 00:09:55,345
You're gonna make me cry.

125
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,473
So? Don't keep me in
suspense. Did I pass?

126
00:09:58,545 --> 00:09:59,727
With flying colors.

127
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,657
Contact me once you have
the Cherry Sapphire.

128
00:10:04,398 --> 00:10:07,553
Bring it to me, and the
bomb's as good as deactivated.

129
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:13,300
Oh, and by the way, you should find tracing
this number to be a waste of precious time.

130
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:15,015
Looks like it.

131
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,635
Where does it say
the call is from, pray tell?

132
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:22,104
Before, it was some mountain in China,
and now it's a satellite over the U.S.

133
00:10:23,608 --> 00:10:26,463
That's enough.
You're good. I admit it.

134
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,500
I see you're someone
I've gotta be serious with.

135
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,080
I'm glad
we understand each other.

136
00:10:32,235 --> 00:10:35,627
I'll be sure not to forget
I'm dealing with Lupin III.

137
00:10:36,745 --> 00:10:37,274
Hmm.

138
00:10:48,376 --> 00:10:49,167
Huh?

139
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:56,441
The thing's
cut clean in two.

140
00:10:56,859 --> 00:10:59,291
What kind of weapon
could do this?

141
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,864
Even cut through
the bulletproof carbon.

142
00:11:02,776 --> 00:11:04,581
What terrifying power.

143
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:08,168
Like I thought,
this one is more suited to you.

144
00:11:08,193 --> 00:11:11,225
...dispose of it in the bucket of some
stranger on the side of the road. I mean,

145
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,416
why bother stealing it
in the first place?

146
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:14,947
To stir up trouble, maybe?

147
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,205
If that was his aim, he
certainly succeeded. I mean...

148
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,526
Conan's been
watching TV all day.

149
00:11:21,551 --> 00:11:22,391
...all they got
was three fish?

150
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,744
He seems down.

151
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:27,207
It's 'cause he tries to do everything
alone, and now that he can't, he's sulking.

152
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,642
Well, he fought
that Goemon guy and lost, right?

153
00:11:29,988 --> 00:11:34,853
Yeah, and check this out. There's tons of
info saying Lupin III is currently in Japan.

154
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:37,315
And Goemon
is one of Lupin's pals.

155
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,287
So does this mean
he's in the city?

156
00:11:39,312 --> 00:11:42,365
It's time for that quiz you
kiddos have been waiting for!

157
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,284
Aww.

158
00:11:43,308 --> 00:11:45,130
You wanna do another pun quiz?

159
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,710
We're not really in the mood.

160
00:11:47,826 --> 00:11:48,906
Yeah, sorry.

161
00:11:50,991 --> 00:11:52,210
Don't be like that.

162
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:53,826
Come on, you guys.
Help him out.

163
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:56,091
We can't start
without a good pun quiz!

164
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,766
I am totally
looking forward to it!

165
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,395
I hope I guess
the right answer!

166
00:11:59,420 --> 00:11:59,948
Hurry up!

167
00:11:59,972 --> 00:12:02,270
Oh, boy. How obvious
can those kids be?

168
00:12:02,295 --> 00:12:03,515
I love quizzes!

169
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:05,052
I prepped the white board.

170
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:05,988
You ready?

171
00:12:06,012 --> 00:12:07,520
Yeah!

172
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,855
Yeah! Let's do it!

173
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,596
I've been
waiting for this!

174
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:13,218
Look this way!

175
00:12:13,242 --> 00:12:14,229
I'm looking!

176
00:12:14,512 --> 00:12:16,686
Lupin absolutely loves beans,

177
00:12:16,711 --> 00:12:19,014
but which one of these
four types is his favorite?

178
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,213
Well, do you know?

179
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,319
I'll give you five minutes
to think about the answer.

180
00:12:25,605 --> 00:12:27,545
So, which is the right bean?

181
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,115
Um...

182
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:29,462
A bean's a bean, right?

183
00:12:29,487 --> 00:12:31,517
They come out of the same place
once you eat 'em.

184
00:12:31,628 --> 00:12:32,597
Genta.

185
00:12:32,936 --> 00:12:35,738
If only the bean in your head
would work a little harder.

186
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:38,088
The answer's three,
fava beans.

187
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:39,960
Really, now? Why's that?

188
00:12:40,252 --> 00:12:44,012
The other three beans are all
what's known as alkaline foods.

189
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,475
Fava beans are acidic,

190
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,685
which shares
a Japanese word for "third."

191
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,316
"Acidic" and "third," huh?

192
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:50,007
Eh?

193
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,010
Lupin...

194
00:12:54,132 --> 00:12:56,110
The third!

195
00:12:56,394 --> 00:12:59,797
Hooray! Hooray!
Hooray!

196
00:13:00,017 --> 00:13:01,850
Are they trying
to pick a fight?

197
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:05,878
Rising Italian idol Emilio Baretti
arrived in Japan this morning.

198
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:09,004
The guy's an
unpredictable world traveler,

199
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:12,596
but I can't say I ever
expected to see him again.

200
00:13:12,907 --> 00:13:16,932
Look, Conan! Emilio is gonna
have a live concert here in Japan!

201
00:13:16,957 --> 00:13:19,544
The Singing Nobleman,
Emilio Baretti!

202
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:21,709
He's super popular
all over the country!

203
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,186
...I know him personally!

204
00:13:23,326 --> 00:13:24,466
You're kidding.

205
00:13:24,616 --> 00:13:25,509
You see that?

206
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:26,362
Definitely.

207
00:13:27,996 --> 00:13:29,434
She was amazing, right?

208
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:30,671
Super amazing.

209
00:13:31,935 --> 00:13:33,498
Maybe his manager?

210
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:35,805
Whoever she is,
she's really beautiful!

211
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:36,919
Isn't she?!

212
00:13:37,018 --> 00:13:39,868
Men'll be men, I see,
even when they're kids.

213
00:13:39,983 --> 00:13:42,968
A pretty lady shows up,
and they're totally captivated.

214
00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:46,397
I'm electing not to comment.

215
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,170
This was live
from Haneda Airport.

216
00:13:50,226 --> 00:13:53,546
Wow, how exciting to have
a major star here with us.

217
00:13:53,597 --> 00:13:56,277
That was
definitely Daisuke Jigen.

218
00:14:00,244 --> 00:14:02,052
Even Conan's looking!

219
00:14:02,077 --> 00:14:03,771
No! You've got it all wrong!

220
00:14:03,846 --> 00:14:05,074
How jerky.

221
00:14:05,098 --> 00:14:06,006
Unbelievable!

222
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:06,842
Knock it off!

223
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:07,822
You were looking!

224
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,136
I was not!

225
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,507
This is the diamond
that was stolen by mistake.

226
00:14:15,723 --> 00:14:18,163
And here are the bullets
that were fired at the crane.

227
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:20,534
Did you say, "mistake," sir?

228
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:22,029
That's a heck of a mistake.

229
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,602
Well, that's Lupin.

230
00:14:23,716 --> 00:14:25,700
He made it a point
to imitate Kid,

231
00:14:25,786 --> 00:14:28,405
and then he took off with
a diamond he didn't even want

232
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,352
and chucked it
into a fisherman's bucket.

233
00:14:30,512 --> 00:14:34,566
Way I see it, that's
a challenge directly to us.

234
00:14:34,746 --> 00:14:36,032
Yeah, it's gotta be.

235
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:38,349
But that's not
what's going on here at all.

236
00:14:39,235 --> 00:14:41,521
You think he's
screwing around like always,

237
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:42,931
Inspector Zenigata?

238
00:14:43,684 --> 00:14:47,719
The crook wants a gem, and his
sights are set on the Cherry Sapphire.

239
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,559
So you remember, Takagi.

240
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:54,498
The only ICPO investigator who
deals exclusively with Lupin III.

241
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:56,968
Yeah, I'm Zenigata.

242
00:14:57,108 --> 00:15:00,813
Inspector, from what you know of
Lupin, are pranks like this his M.O.?

243
00:15:00,844 --> 00:15:01,964
Yes.

244
00:15:01,989 --> 00:15:05,154
We're gonna need some out-of-the-box
thinking on this one, folks.

245
00:15:05,188 --> 00:15:06,475
If that's the case, sir,

246
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,095
why do you think he's really
after the Cherry Sapphire?

247
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,855
That's a good point.
It could just be another prank.

248
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,036
He texted me.

249
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,306
He actually sends you texts?

250
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,554
Sometimes,
but obviously I can't reply.

251
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:18,316
They're texting buddies!

252
00:15:18,341 --> 00:15:19,044
That's crazy.

253
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,328
Look.

254
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:23,274
Hey, everyone take it easy.

255
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:27,561
Well, what do you say? Can I
borrow a couple of these guys, Megure?

256
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:31,282
I'm not sure they're fit for the
job. But I'm not gonna turn you down.

257
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:34,272
Say what?! I could be
part of the hunt for Lupin?

258
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:37,395
The Second Investigation
Division usually handles it,

259
00:15:37,556 --> 00:15:41,319
but unfortunately Inspector
Nakamori has been suspended.

260
00:15:41,632 --> 00:15:44,500
Makes sense, considering
the Tsukishima incident.

261
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:45,287
Then...

262
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:46,848
They need some First
Division members to fill in...

263
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,460
Me! Me! Pick me! Me!

264
00:15:48,485 --> 00:15:49,577
Hey, what's with the shouting?

265
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,019
Please, me, too!

266
00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:57,054
I never dreamed I would get the
chance to play a part in Lupin's arrest.

267
00:15:57,118 --> 00:16:00,629
Funny enough, Lupin III
was Officer Sato's first love.

268
00:16:00,654 --> 00:16:01,507
Takagi!

269
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,858
I see. That's why
you raised your hand first.

270
00:16:04,883 --> 00:16:06,025
That's not it, sir.

271
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,666
I wouldn't volunteer
for such a frivolous reason.

272
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:10,170
I'm fine with it.

273
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,099
I get
wanting to arrest an old flame.

274
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:16,080
There are just some things
you gotta do yourself.

275
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,985
I'm expecting your best.

276
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,075
Thanks, Inspector.

277
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,078
I'll give my all, sir!

278
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:25,903
In a sense,

279
00:16:25,928 --> 00:16:27,950
I'd say I love Lupin, too.

280
00:16:29,651 --> 00:16:33,148
It's just too funny. Why
would anyone park here?

281
00:16:33,173 --> 00:16:36,634
Don't know, but they'll see what happens
when you cross the Traffic Division.

282
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:39,022
But hang on a ticket.
The plates don't check out.

283
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:40,299
What do you think it means?

284
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:44,010
It means these aren't your
run-of-the-mill fake plates.

285
00:16:44,035 --> 00:16:46,946
So this car could belong
to a shady syndicate?

286
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:49,145
It's sure
steamy with suspicion.

287
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:50,763
Do people still say, "steamy"?

288
00:16:50,883 --> 00:16:52,609
Wait. You don't?

289
00:16:54,675 --> 00:16:57,408
Wow, sir.
You really parked here?

290
00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:01,340
In fact, it was an Interpol car.

291
00:17:01,644 --> 00:17:04,458
That doesn't really mean much
to our Traffic Division.

292
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,296
Miyamoto and Miike again.

293
00:17:06,894 --> 00:17:08,853
I'll head
to the Traffic Division!

294
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:11,424
Will there be a fine?

295
00:17:14,017 --> 00:17:15,145
It's Sonoko.

296
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:17,175
How's it going? Things okay?

297
00:17:17,722 --> 00:17:19,650
Check the news? Right now?

298
00:17:19,675 --> 00:17:20,924
Welcome to Japan. What's
your favorite Japanese food?

299
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:22,363
Yeah. I'm watching.

300
00:17:22,388 --> 00:17:22,931
It's natto.

301
00:17:22,956 --> 00:17:25,815
Then guess who I get to see
after school tomorrow.

302
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,172
That's right, Emilio!
The hottie himself!

303
00:17:30,827 --> 00:17:32,857
I know what hotel
he's staying at!

304
00:17:33,572 --> 00:17:34,534
Get outta here!

305
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,162
How'd you pull off
something like that?

306
00:17:36,187 --> 00:17:38,668
It's all thanks
to our intelligence network.

307
00:17:38,895 --> 00:17:39,943
Made it easy.

308
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:44,101
You are something else. That's
personal information, you know.

309
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:49,074
Huh?

310
00:17:52,483 --> 00:17:55,066
Wow, and his manager
is a beauty!

311
00:17:55,212 --> 00:17:56,305
Seriously?

312
00:17:56,348 --> 00:17:58,301
That Sonoko is such a goof.

313
00:17:58,428 --> 00:18:00,950
She could have waited 'til
tomorrow to talk about homework.

314
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:02,711
You're going to meet him,
aren't you?

315
00:18:03,537 --> 00:18:04,504
Oh, boy.

316
00:18:05,572 --> 00:18:06,921
What a knockout!

317
00:18:06,946 --> 00:18:09,536
He's just
a grown-up version of the boys.

318
00:18:09,948 --> 00:18:11,179
I'm going, too.

319
00:18:11,204 --> 00:18:12,038
Huh?!

320
00:18:19,947 --> 00:18:22,115
You think
all this is necessary?

321
00:18:22,215 --> 00:18:24,397
He often escapes
by helicopter.

322
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:27,315
So your plan
is to shoot him down instead?

323
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:29,946
Are you sure
this is going to work out?

324
00:18:30,086 --> 00:18:32,549
We might need to think
about moving the gem.

325
00:18:32,655 --> 00:18:36,104
Personally, I think the safest
place for it is right here.

326
00:18:36,303 --> 00:18:40,203
The more you move it, the more
chances Lupin has to nab it.

327
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,513
Exactly. Let's check
the vault one more time.

328
00:18:43,607 --> 00:18:44,170
Sir!

329
00:18:44,194 --> 00:18:45,328
Uh, wait for me!

330
00:18:47,805 --> 00:18:50,240
Ah! Now this is a vault!

331
00:18:50,367 --> 00:18:52,330
And what about
the sapphire's owner?

332
00:18:52,355 --> 00:18:53,088
You reach him?

333
00:18:53,113 --> 00:18:53,790
Yes.

334
00:18:53,815 --> 00:18:58,757
When I got ahold of him, I asked about
temporarily moving the gem to another location,

335
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,474
but Mr. Eishin Wakagomo said...

336
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:02,561
No need for that.

337
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:05,675
I have absolute faith
in the Japanese police force.

338
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,994
He's got
a lot of confidence in you.

339
00:19:10,325 --> 00:19:11,764
We're gonna get him for sure!

340
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:14,692
So please leave everything
to us! Right, Ms. Sato?!

341
00:19:14,812 --> 00:19:15,521
What are you...

342
00:19:15,545 --> 00:19:16,494
You, too!

343
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:19,125
Let's work together
and do our best!

344
00:19:19,198 --> 00:19:19,938
Yeah!

345
00:19:19,998 --> 00:19:22,710
You're embarrassing me.
Take it down a notch.

346
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,110
Five minutes 'til the time
on Lupin's theft notice!

347
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,675
Put roadblocks on all streets!

348
00:19:28,761 --> 00:19:31,058
All through traffic
is now prohibited!

349
00:19:31,118 --> 00:19:34,613
Everyone not on bank security,
switch to Channel B for comms!

350
00:19:39,165 --> 00:19:42,235
There ever been an occasion
when Lupin wasn't punctual?

351
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:43,565
No.

352
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:46,598
If that's accurate...
there's a minute left.

353
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,670
Which means he has to be
somewhere nearby, right?

354
00:19:49,695 --> 00:19:53,445
Yeah. He could be disguised as
one of us at this very moment.

355
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,122
Wait!

356
00:19:55,147 --> 00:19:56,040
What? Who?!

357
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,657
Ms. Sato,
what are you doing?!

358
00:19:58,682 --> 00:20:00,598
Don't you move, or I'll shoot.

359
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:01,165
But I...

360
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,289
He doesn't always
imitate a person.

361
00:20:03,389 --> 00:20:04,210
What?

362
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,880
He can be other things, too?

363
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,550
That's the first
I'm hearing of this!

364
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,880
What would you do
if Lupin masqueraded

365
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,550
as that vault door there?

366
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,170
Sorry.

367
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,090
Just trying to defuse
some of the tension, you know?

368
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:24,590
Thought that'd get a laugh
out of everyone. Sheesh.

369
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,770
Oh, look at the time.

370
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,730
It's already past 1:00.

371
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,150
Really?
But nothing's happening.

372
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,440
Maybe all the security forced
him to reschedule his attempt?

373
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,150
No, that's not his style.

374
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,600
The man gets what he wants.

375
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,150
That's just
who Lupin III is.

376
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,310
Are you're saying
Lupin already found a way

377
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
to sneak inside the vault?

378
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,770
I saw it in a movie.

379
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,560
It was a heist flick
where the thieves

380
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:51,480
dug a tunnel
directly under the vault.

381
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,020
Got a camera in there?

382
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,650
There are privacy issues
which prohibit such a thing.

383
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,900
Let's take a look,
just to be sure.

384
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,020
- All clear.
There's not a hole to be found.

385
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,400
Oh, thank goodness!

386
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,650
Hey, is it possible
he found some other way

387
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,310
to get to the Cherry Sapphire?

388
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,270
You think he already
made off with it?

389
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,730
- There's just no way!
It's impossible!

390
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,190
Don't you need two keys
to open the box?

391
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:27,810
Indeed. Mr. Eishin
entrusted me with them both.

392
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,230
Ah, it's here.

393
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,020
The Cherry Sapphire is safe.

394
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,440
It's three past the time
he announced he'd steal it.

395
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,440
Hmm.

396
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,980
You think maybe, just maybe...

397
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,270
It's possible
everyone's watches

398
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,810
are running three minutes fast?

399
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,480
Wha?!

400
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,900
It's 1:00 now!

401
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,850
Of course. Earlier...

402
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,310
Lupin disguised himself
as Takagi

403
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,100
and adjusted our watches
three minutes forward!

404
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,850
What a brilliant deduction.

405
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,480
Right on time.

406
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,770
I'll be taking this, Pops.

407
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,480
Have a break, courtesy of me.

408
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,020
Farewell, my first love!

409
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,440
Ow, ow, ow, ow!
That hurts, you know!

410
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,190
Agh! You're gonna break it!

411
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:34,900
When you say
you're gonna do something,

412
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,060
you see it through.

413
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,900
A strong, beautiful lady
caught you.

414
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,100
You should cheer up.

415
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,400
- Come on, Pops.
This isn't fair.

416
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,940
You're taking advantage
of the fact

417
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,850
I won't get rough
with a woman, you cheat.

418
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,900
There we go.

419
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,440
Setting it back
three minutes.

420
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,150
Lupin III, as of 1:02 P.M.,

421
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,560
I hereby place you
under arrest for theft.

422
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,560
Brilliant! Simply brilliant!

423
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,600
Your talents are wasted
as a police detective!

424
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:03,150
'Scuse me. I hate to break up
this touching moment, but...

425
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:06,190
But what? Move, and you
get a bullet in the rear.

426
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,310
I'd listen. She's not someone
you want to tick off.

427
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
You mind
checking your watches?

428
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,650
I slipped some
silver-colored stickers on 'em.

429
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,400
They still there?

430
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,650
A sticker?

431
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,600
Yeah, I see it. What's it for?

432
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,100
Those are electrifying
stickers from yours truly.

433
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,770
I designed them
to be stronger than a stun gun.

434
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:29,270
I think these are yours, Miss.
Sorry to trouble you.

435
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,940
Huh?

436
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,270
Don't you move!

437
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,400
You are a stubborn one, Pops.

438
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,940
Another jolt should do it.

439
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,270
Sorry to catch you up
in that, Miss.

440
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,440
It's nothing personal.

441
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,560
You're gonna get it!

442
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:50,230
Holy cow. How are you
not counting sheep right now?

443
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:53,100
I don't think the lady could
take it if I zapped you again.

444
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,400
Toodles!

445
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,730
Lupin, you lousy,
good-for-nothing...

446
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,940
So scary.

447
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,690
We found Lupin!

448
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,270
Hurry! He's hiding in the vault!

449
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,310
He's disguised
as Inspector Zenigata!

450
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
What?

451
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,980
- Lupin is here!
- Take him down!

452
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,520
Come on!

453
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,940
- That's right, boys!
Go and get 'im!

454
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,150
- You idiots!
I'm not the phony!

455
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,850
It's not me!

456
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,850
Lupin is currently
in the bank!

457
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,980
Again, he's in the...

458
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,020
Here you go.

459
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,810
It's Lupin!

460
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,230
No!
The real one's over here!

461
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,690
The third Lupin is in custody.

462
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:48,310
Wait. There's a fourth one
in front of the tobacco shop.

463
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,980
We believe this one
to be a fake.

464
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,810
- We work in TV!
- Damn thing won't come off.

465
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,310
Commander, sir, is there a way
to tell which Lupin is real?

466
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,350
There's a canine Lupin
at Beika Park.

467
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,480
Friendly little pupper.

468
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,690
We've got a squad in pursuit
at Beika Park's north entrance!

469
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,810
Had to run out
of masks eventually!

470
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,730
Lupin has entered
Beika Street!

471
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,060
Head to the south entrance!

472
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,850
Don't mean
to disturb your shopping!

473
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,730
- Hey, how's business?
- Whoa!

474
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,850
Nice gutting technique!

475
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,480
Check out
my mackerel smackerel!

476
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,350
'Kay, boys! Get inked!

477
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,560
Everybody stand back!

478
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,190
What a world
we live in, eh, Granny?

479
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,560
You are the sweetest.

480
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:34,560
Would you like to meet
my granddaughter?

481
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,020
That meeting's
gonna have to wait!

482
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,400
Damn it!

483
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,100
Don't you realize you're
playing right into his hands?

484
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:49,690
- What do we do, sir?
Call HQ for more reinforcements?

485
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:52,560
- The opposite.
Call off the investigation.

486
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:55,020
- Huh?
- He's long gone.

487
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,480
Sir, where are you going?

488
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,190
Fried my watch.

489
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,980
Damn it. I liked this one, too.

490
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,980
What just happened?

491
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,480
We've lost all trace of Lupin.

492
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:17,150
Strong legs are an essential
tool for a master thief,

493
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:20,770
which is why I can't
get enough of a good chase.

494
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,150
Huh? It's you.

495
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:32,310
If you weren't using a car
and didn't have a chopper,

496
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,560
then Beika Station...

497
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:38,350
Problem is, it would
go into lockdown too quickly.

498
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,190
There'd be too much distance

499
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,850
between the bank
and the subway station.

500
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,190
I had the very same thought
at first

501
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,940
until I discovered the position

502
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,650
of the ventilation shafts
and workers' entrance.

503
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,600
I could fall
for a gal like you.

504
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,270
Brainsandgrit.

505
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,730
But can't you give me a break?

506
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:59,270
You don't know how badly
I need this gem, Miss.

507
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,980
Wait!

508
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,900
Once the numbness wears off,
let's play again.

509
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,940
I'm certain that door leads

510
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,270
to the power company's
utility conduit.

511
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,600
I can't let him get through.

512
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,480
Accident 100 meters

513
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,900
before Nishi Beika Station!

514
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,350
Ms. Sato...

515
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,850
you okay?

516
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,350
Oh. Takagi.

517
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,650
I'm glad I got to you in time.

518
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,850
Would you try
being less reckless?

519
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,270
Eh, you're a fine one
to talk about being cautious.

520
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,150
I mean, really.

521
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:01,690
Getting captured
by the same thief you're after.

522
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:04,060
- You're right.
Sorry about that.

523
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,560
He caught me off guard.

524
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,690
Jeez.

525
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,900
Sato...

526
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,900
I vow to never
leave your side again.

527
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,400
Whatever you say.

528
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,810
Wha... You're cuffing me? Why?

529
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,440
Because you're really Lupin.

530
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,400
Takagi would never act that way.

531
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,150
Whoops!
Guess you caught me red-handed!

532
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,650
Hey!

533
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,190
Get back here! Lupin!

534
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,520
Eh?

535
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,600
Hmm? What's the matter?

536
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:37,440
Did you hear
Officer Sato just now?

537
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,690
- Say what?
I think you're hearing things.

538
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,650
Sorry my dad's tagging along.

539
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,020
Not a problem.

540
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,730
It'd be weird
if he liked Emilio,

541
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,690
but he's after the manager,
right?

542
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,440
Who am I to judge his love life?

543
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,350
Well, this is the place,
Princess Ran.

544
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,190
Oh, cut that out!

545
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,440
Coming here
sure brings back memories.

546
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,270
- What do you mean?
It hasn't been that long, silly!

547
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,810
- That's true.
- You can wait here

548
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,690
while I go
and get the manager.

549
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,100
You're going to get him?

550
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,150
I'm the famous sleuth
who stopped

551
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,600
the attempted poisoning
of the Vespanian Princess.

552
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,940
Kogoro Mori.
Nice to make your acquaintance.

553
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,060
What are you up to over here?

554
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,060
My assistant
made an appointment.

555
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,060
Your what?

556
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,850
Why is he like this?

557
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,310
Smooth-talking a clerk
won't help us.

558
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,270
But it might not hurt, either.

559
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,560
I'll handle it from here.

560
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,810
Detective Mori,
let's take this elsewhere.

561
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,150
- Please, this way.
- Ah, sure!

562
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,730
What just happened?

563
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:34,810
Hey, what happened?

564
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,400
You're confused, too?

565
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,150
Of course I'm confused.

566
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,270
Let's follow 'em!

567
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,270
Why not?

568
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,810
Wait for me!

569
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,580
I don't care
if it's Interpol!

570
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,410
A violation's a violation.

571
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,580
Our directive
is to collect the towing fee,

572
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,000
no matter who it's from.

573
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,290
It'll be a boon
to the national treasury.

574
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,870
He should get
his own car, anyway!

575
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,500
How about a nice dent?

576
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,450
The key is inside, isn't it?

577
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,330
It's under the left visor,
like in the West.

578
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:06,160
What the... Officer Takagi's
all cooped up in the back!

579
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,410
Really? How come?

580
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,160
What are you doing back here?

581
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:16,500
The other guests have gathered
in the conference room.

582
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,790
Waiting on me to get started,
are they?

583
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,830
Sorry for the holdup.

584
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,250
Hmm?

585
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:25,330
Here's our stop.

586
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:26,580
To the left, down the hall.

587
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,660
Got you.

588
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,450
The room is over here.

589
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,120
It is good to be back.

590
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,870
Sorry to burst in!

591
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,370
Dad,
you should knock first!

592
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,120
What happened? Huh?

593
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,080
- Eh?
- No. Sorry. It's nothing.

594
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,870
- Huh?
- Inspector Shiratori!

595
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:43,870
- Uh...
- Ohh.

596
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,160
Mori?

597
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,660
Uh, hey, Inspector.

598
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,370
What are you doing here?

599
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,410
- Hello, sir.
- Is he here? Is he?

600
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,830
Mr. Megure,
who are these people?

601
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,950
There's nothing
to worry about. This is...

602
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,000
I'm Japan's
number one detective,

603
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,750
Kogoro Mori, here to serve
at your pleasure,signorina.

604
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,120
- Good to know.
- Eh?

605
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,330
I'm so sorry.

606
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,410
I'm this one's daughter,
Ran Mori.

607
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,450
I'm his assistant,
Miss Suzuki...

608
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,290
but call me Sonoko!

609
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,910
You are both hopeless.

610
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,500
The inspectors
were called in.

611
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,790
Interesting.
So the doorman recognized Pops

612
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:20,000
and thought he was
part of the team.

613
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,450
Eh? Hey, did something happen?

614
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,950
Doesn't pertain
to why we're here.

615
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,370
...without you two
getting into trouble?

616
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,290
- That hurts!
- There's news.

617
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,160
Takagi is safe,

618
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,040
but the Cherry Sapphire was...

619
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,330
Lupin?!

620
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,500
Lupin, darling!

621
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,830
Fujicakes!

622
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:51,620
I was so worried!

623
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,450
Did they hurt you?

624
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,080
No, but I was scared
out of my mind.

625
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,370
- I bet.
And them making you wear

626
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,660
this tacky necklace
couldn't have helped.

627
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,290
You got a lousy sense
of fashion! You know that?

628
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:06,830
I just want to end this.

629
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,700
Now hand it over to Fujiko.

630
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,290
Someone's impatient.

631
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,910
What, you're not
a fan of small talk?

632
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,410
Easy there, boys.

633
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,410
You think I'm dumb enough
to pull a gun here?

634
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,870
Just look at the situation
I'm in! Really.

635
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:22,790
Leave the box. I only require
the Cherry Sapphire inside.

636
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,830
You, sir, are no fun at all.

637
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,910
Well, it looks like he
didn't plant anything in here.

638
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,160
Hmm?

639
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,450
Apologies, doll.

640
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,620
So you're really with him,
aren't you?

641
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,120
Funny thing about this collar,

642
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,200
it's a big, fat fake.

643
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,620
Which means...

644
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,290
Sorry, but you're not
getting this jewel, either.

645
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:45,830
You're cool with that, right?

646
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,410
Oh, and lose the guns.

647
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,200
- Hot damn!
That's my Fujicakes for you!

648
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:53,040
At least, that's what I'd
like to say right now,

649
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,290
but you were
a bit naive on this one.

650
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,000
Huh? How so?

651
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,620
Well, that explosive is
clearly the genuine article.

652
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,500
Are you for real?

653
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,250
Only a scumbag would fool
a defenseless woman!

654
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:09,040
If you want it that bad, here!

655
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,580
Well, what now?

656
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,160
Tell me, should I wish my head,
"Fare thee well,"

657
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,120
before you blow it
to kingdom come?

658
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,620
It sounds as if you don't care
for my little machinations.

659
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,370
Not to worry, though.
Our business has ended.

660
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,330
As soon as our safety
is assured,

661
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,790
I'll see the collar is released.

662
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,000
Of course,
if this gem is a fake...

663
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,620
- Don't worry yourself.
It's the real deal.

664
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,080
So what's the word?

665
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,040
We done, or is this all
some big, elaborate test?

666
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,540
No test.

667
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,450
I've got what I want.

668
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,040
You can keep the van.

669
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,450
Consider the coat inside
as a gift.

670
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,450
'Ppreciate it.

671
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:48,000
Now we're done.

672
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,950
I never want
to see you lot again.

673
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,410
Allow me
to introduce you

674
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,080
to the concert's promoter,
Luciano Carnevale.

675
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,080
Greetings.

676
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,910
And this over here is...

677
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,370
- Claudia Bellucci.
It's a pleasure.

678
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:09,750
I work on the team
as Emilio's manager.

679
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,660
- And what a job you do!
- Uh...

680
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,290
anyway, the reason
we're here is...

681
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:16,660
Inspector, are you sure
it's okay to include him?

682
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:20,330
Despite how he comes across,
you can trust Mr. Mori.

683
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:22,160
Despite
the backhanded compliment,

684
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,040
he's right.
You can depend on me.

685
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,330
Hmm.

686
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:27,450
Fine, then.

687
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,830
Have a look.

688
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:31,200
It arrived for Emilio
this morning.

689
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:33,910
Hmm? Uh, what's inside?

690
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,500
Hmm?

691
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,200
What?! This is...

692
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,620
I have...

693
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,160
no clue what this says.

694
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,330
We went through
all that buildup,

695
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:54,200
and you can't even read it?

696
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,410
That's just like him.

697
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,410
Letters from a newspaper...

698
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,660
in Italian?

699
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,450
The message says,
"Cancel the concert.

700
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,950
Otherwise,
Emilio's a dead man."

701
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,540
No!

702
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,410
You're being threatened?

703
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,000
- A death threat, huh?
That's rough.

704
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,290
How many people
have touched this directly?

705
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,290
I haven't laid a hand on it.

706
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,790
Emilio and I
have both touched the letter.

707
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:28,370
So if we find fingerprints
other than yours,

708
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:31,250
there's a good chance
they belong to our perp.

709
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,950
If we could lift
the culprit's prints,

710
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,660
it'd sure make our job
a hell of a lot easier.

711
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,370
We should cancel it.

712
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:39,910
This is ridiculous!

713
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,950
Let's cancel
and be done with it!

714
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,410
Emilio!

715
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,500
We can't just cancel
at the drop of a hat!

716
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,660
Are you aware
how much money's been spent

717
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,950
just to set up
this concert here?

718
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,580
We even had them rush
renovations to Tohto Stadium,

719
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,500
and you're performing
to a sold-out house!

720
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,330
It's virtually impossible

721
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,910
to cancel the show
at this point, and you know it!

722
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:05,000
Please, Lupin!

723
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,700
He says if you don't,
this'll explode.

724
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,330
If you love me
like you say you do,

725
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:11,750
I know you'll take the gig.

726
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:14,040
Enough, already. Stop teasing.

727
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,790
Just say
I brought it on myself.

728
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,160
Hold your horses.

729
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,450
The part I wanna scold you about
is coming up.

730
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,000
Oh, forget it.

731
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,000
I'll just have to ask
Kid instead.

732
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,790
What's the big deal?

733
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:28,120
All this time,
and you still don't get it.

734
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,250
Get what?

735
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,950
When it comes
to protecting you,

736
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,290
there's only one man
for the job.

737
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,500
And that would be...

738
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,040
Lupin...

739
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,790
Winner! And for your prize...

740
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,120
Don't!

741
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,290
What's the matter?

742
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:44,200
You need to get away.

743
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,620
Otherwise...

744
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,830
If dying with you
is how I go out,

745
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,660
then what an ending.

746
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,040
Smarmy bastard.

747
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,250
Play me for a fool, will he?

748
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:04,790
His ass is grass!

749
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:12,540
Fujicakes, you took my clothes.

750
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,500
Was deactivating it
the right move?

751
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,870
It wouldn't do
to kill that woman.

752
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:24,330
If I did, Lupin would
surely come after us.

753
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,120
I can't afford that now.

754
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:31,080
It's imperative I get it
for our motherland.

755
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,830
The fact that Emilio
is residing at this hotel

756
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:36,370
while he's here hasn't
been made public knowledge.

757
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,910
As far as we're aware,
only the concert staff

758
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,910
and some
of the hotel employees know.

759
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,080
But we can't say for sure
the culprit wasn't an outsider.

760
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,450
Some enthusiastic fans
do everything in their power

761
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,200
to find out
where a celeb is staying.

762
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,580
It's probably just a prank,

763
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:55,200
but I'll put plainclothes
officers on guard duty.

764
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:57,620
- We'll have to play it by ear.
- I've figured it out!

765
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,790
Hmm?

766
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:01,000
What? Are you serious, Mori?!

767
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:05,330
Sure am! The person who sent
this threat was clearly...

768
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,950
Lupin III!

769
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,950
- Lupin?!
- Uh...

770
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,950
You think so?

771
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,200
Really, Pops?

772
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,620
The burglar who's been
causing a fuss in this town

773
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,290
for the last couple of days.

774
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:17,660
He made a big production
out of stealing a gem

775
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,410
and then threw it away. Hmph.

776
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,700
I guess the bauble
didn't suit his fancy.

777
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:24,160
The phone call
you ducked out of here to take

778
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:27,160
was a report that Lupin had
gotten away with a new jewel.

779
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,040
Isn't that right, Shiratori?

780
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,580
What happened, Pops?

781
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,580
You're on fire for once.

782
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,830
Well, it's true enough
we just got a report,

783
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,290
but you believe
there's a connection

784
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,410
between that theft
and this threat?

785
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,540
It was all part of his plan,

786
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,290
but first
he needed a valuable gem

787
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,620
and the concert
to be shut down.

788
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,200
His goal...

789
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,410
Go on.

790
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,910
Miss Claudia!

791
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,700
As soon as all this
wears on you,

792
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:54,700
he'll give you the jewel as
a present to improve your mood.

793
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,950
Does that check out?

794
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,200
Sure!

795
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:58,790
He's going to all this trouble

796
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:01,330
just to put the moves on you!
It's dangerous here!

797
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,250
You should stay with me
just to be safe.

798
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,660
Emilio.

799
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:11,700
I'll be fine. All I'm
gonna do is go back to my room.

800
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:15,040
Man, I didn't even
get his autograph.

801
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,290
- Let's go, Sonoko.
Things here are pretty hectic.

802
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,450
You, too, Conan.

803
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,540
All right!

804
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,870
And him?

805
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,750
Dad's impossible
when he's like this.

806
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:28,750
Figures.

807
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,120
For your protection,

808
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,200
I'll post guards on this floor.

809
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:33,660
It'll all work out.

810
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:36,540
I mean, he already has
a reliable bodyguard, right?

811
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,540
Huh?

812
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,750
Smart boy.

813
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:40,120
You're very well informed.

814
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,080
I saw him on TV!

815
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,750
Conan!

816
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,160
Coming!

817
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,500
And you believe
you can depend on this guard?

818
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,410
It's said he tripled
the military might

819
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,540
of one country
by training its soldiers

820
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,620
with his
charismatic instruction.

821
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,580
Impressive, Papa.

822
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,050
Thanks for having us.

823
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:02,050
Hey, wasn't there
a sweets shop downstairs?

824
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:04,210
- Yeah, there was.
You've got sharp eyes.

825
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,050
Wanna stop by?

826
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,340
Sure. Let's go.

827
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,130
One floor above the lobby,
right?

828
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:18,210
Yep.

829
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,920
Conan? Wha...

830
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,090
Huh? Hey, brat,

831
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,800
knock it off,
or we're leaving you!

832
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,460
Please don't leave me!

833
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,880
So you girls
wanna get out of here?

834
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,130
Is that allowed?

835
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,500
Wow, the little brat
turned out all right,

836
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,550
- didn't he, Ran?
- Uh...

837
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,380
Sonoko, it's clearly not him!

838
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,550
It's like a miracle!

839
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,170
Sonoko!

840
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,250
Hmm.

841
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,960
Slow down. Wait!

842
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:00,590
Emilio and I
are running off together,

843
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:03,340
and his hand's
even on my shoulder.

844
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,840
It's a dream come true!

845
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,090
- Hold on!
Please, wait a second!

846
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:11,800
Stop running, already!

847
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:15,090
Oh, sorry.

848
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,880
Sonoko, you have
to think this through.

849
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,380
Aren't you even
gonna ask me if I'm okay?

850
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,550
That's enough! You know he
can't leave at a time like this.

851
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,250
- Why not?
- Did you forget?

852
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,170
Someone out there
wants to kill him.

853
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,210
If Emilio came to harm
because of us...

854
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,460
Don't tell me
you fell for a prank like that.

855
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:35,050
You can't prove it's a prank.

856
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:37,460
Or did you miss the letter
saying he'd be a dead man?

857
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,710
It doesn't ring a bell.

858
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,460
Get serious!

859
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:43,300
You took down the Vespanian
Kingdom's strongest bodyguard.

860
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,210
- We'll be fine!
- That was different.

861
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,380
I bet there aren't any threats
within ten kilometers of us!

862
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,090
Oh, Sonoko.

863
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:51,630
Here's an idea, ladies.

864
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,170
Let's take a trip up there.

865
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,750
Sure! Just lead the way!

866
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,250
Just watch.

867
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,300
We're gonna get
in big trouble for doing this!

868
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,880
You'll pollute your lungs
hanging around here.

869
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,210
But this is
the only place in the hotel

870
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,630
where you can smokeanddrink,
isn't it?

871
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,300
Heh. Yo, Great Detective.

872
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,210
This area is for adults.

873
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,750
Oh, I just came
to pick up Papa.

874
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,250
- Is that so?
Then can I offer you some juice?

875
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,090
An iced coffee will do.

876
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:41,420
- Huh?
- Be back in just a moment.

877
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:45,630
Come on.

878
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,460
You didn't think
you were the only one

879
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:50,000
with a taste for iced coffee
year round, did you?

880
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:53,380
What are you and your partners
up to in this town?

881
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,420
So, you're here
as Shinichi Kudo?

882
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,210
Thank you for your patience.

883
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,670
I also thought
you'd like dessert,

884
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,300
so I brought some lemon pie.

885
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,880
Ah, thanks, Mister!

886
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,130
Life's rough for you, too, huh?

887
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,000
You idiot.

888
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,250
Ah, so you do
say, "idiot," a lot.

889
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,340
And "I have to go
to the bathroom" as well.

890
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,000
Where are you
getting this from?!

891
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:18,460
Young as you are
and going like that,

892
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:20,130
you might want
to go to the doctor.

893
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:22,130
You know why I have to say it.

894
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:25,920
You should know
that adults can be scary.

895
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,170
Was that a threat?

896
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,800
Don't worry about it.

897
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,630
As long as you don't
stick your nose in my affairs,

898
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,550
the two of us have no problem.

899
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:38,590
- Question.
In those fancy notes of yours,

900
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:39,880
does it say
I'm the type of person

901
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,840
who gets fired up
when threatened?

902
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,500
You're a real pain in the ass.

903
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:46,670
Now for some pie!

904
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,880
- Not so fast!
You called me "Papa"!

905
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,250
You're late!

906
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:55,420
- It's me.
- What's wrong, Ran?

907
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,920
- You can't find Emilio?!
- You're with Emilio?!

908
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,920
- Why isn't he with you?
That's your job!

909
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,670
Yeah. Sonoko's here, too.

910
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:03,380
Everyone is looking for him.

911
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,460
He won't come back
until we go to the top,

912
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:06,960
so tell Dad and the others we...

913
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:08,550
I think I'll hold on to this!

914
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:09,960
No! Give that back!

915
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:11,340
Hey!

916
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,460
Sounds like
they're having a good time.

917
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:17,800
All right, I got you.

918
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,210
Mmm.

919
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:22,880
About your call...

920
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,500
So good!

921
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,420
Sounds like
they were with Emilio.

922
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,960
Seems that way.

923
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:31,170
You know where they are?

924
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:33,170
Can't say I do!

925
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:35,750
What say we make a deal
between us adults?

926
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,840
I'm heading out!

927
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,090
Okay, you win!

928
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:41,500
I'll rip up the notes!

929
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,500
Here! Look!

930
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,960
Papa's sorry.

931
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,090
It's so fast!

932
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:54,340
Incredible.

933
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,550
I don't know about this, guys.

934
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:58,800
What the hell
was that bodyguard doing?

935
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,670
Asking won't help us now.

936
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:02,800
We should try searching
the nearby area.

937
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,840
And the inspectors have left?

938
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,800
Yes, except for
that private detective.

939
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:08,880
Is he looking, too?

940
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,960
He is.

941
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:13,710
We should fire
that useless bodyguard.

942
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,800
My apologies.

943
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,090
But once this is over,

944
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:22,590
I'll be gone
before you get the chance.

945
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:34,550
If anywhere, it'd be here.

946
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,800
Ahh!

947
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,710
A beautiful sunset...

948
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,500
and a handsome guy!

949
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,300
Stand down.

950
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,460
That face could kill.

951
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:49,630
No way.

952
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,710
Everybody here looks suspicious.

953
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,800
Come on. Let's go back.

954
00:45:57,550 --> 00:45:59,750
Doubt it's there, but...

955
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,420
might as well
check this room, too.

956
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,460
The kid even changed his shoes.

957
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:22,130
Hmm?

958
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:24,250
Hmm?

959
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:32,800
It's me.
Like I figured, it's not here.

960
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,340
Huh?

961
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,460
Maybe in some
concert equipment?

962
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,210
- What?
- Don't you "what" me.

963
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,670
Hmm. Weren't you tower bound?

964
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:47,710
I thought I'd go
with you instead, Papa.

965
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,380
Liar.

966
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:52,130
I'm surprised they let
the bodyguard have a spare key.

967
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:56,840
You gonna arrest me
despite my innocence?

968
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,460
The gun is reason enough
to take you in.

969
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,960
Hey, here's a piece of advice
from Papa to son.

970
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:05,340
This doesn't concern
you and your friends,

971
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:07,840
so why not leave it alone, huh?

972
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:11,960
Well?

973
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:13,090
Forget it.

974
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:18,190
Excuse me, Miss.

975
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:20,230
Yes? What is it? Need help?

976
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,230
You have
an Italian newspaper on hand?

977
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:24,520
Oh, I'm sorry,
but we only carry

978
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,650
English-language
newspapers here.

979
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:27,900
Is it urgent?

980
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,440
No. That's all right.

981
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,980
Well, thank you, anyway.

982
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,810
Can I ask a favor?

983
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,020
Yes, darling?

984
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,480
Mind if I stop in there?

985
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,020
Do what you need to do.

986
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:49,350
It sure took you long enough.

987
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,850
Huh? What does that mean?

988
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,810
Oh.

989
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,980
I know Lupin has been busy.

990
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,400
He got away
with the Cherry Sapphire,

991
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,600
despite it being
in a lockbox in Tohto Bank.

992
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:04,600
This gem he stole,
what's the deal?

993
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:07,810
As far as I can tell,
it's not particularly special.

994
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,850
It didn't even appear
in a web search.

995
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:12,440
But Lupin announced it
and everything.

996
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,480
Hang on!

997
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,190
This is about the jewel's owner!

998
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:17,980
Bingo.

999
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,600
And now you've caught up
to Genta and the other two.

1000
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:22,600
Caught up to them?

1001
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:24,270
You mean they're doing it again?

1002
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:28,270
Not only that,
they're more fired up than ever.

1003
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:32,100
This morning, they searched
abandoned homes in town,

1004
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:33,940
from bushes to basements.

1005
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:36,350
They're really looking
for his hideout?

1006
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,400
But not even
the police can find it.

1007
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,770
- Well, they did.
-What?!

1008
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:43,810
The Cherry Sapphire's owner,
Eishin Wakagomo.

1009
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,270
Why would the kind of man

1010
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:47,270
who rents a safe-deposit box
at a bank

1011
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:50,020
be in an abandoned repair shop?

1012
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,730
Adding to their suspicion,

1013
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:54,270
the front shutters
have recently been replaced.

1014
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:56,900
They uncovered that much
all by themselves?

1015
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,270
Professor's all in, too.

1016
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:01,600
Of course he is.

1017
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:03,270
Trying to stop them
is pointless.

1018
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:04,810
Keep them there!

1019
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,650
I'll explain the stakes
when I get back.

1020
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:08,190
Of all the...

1021
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:10,400
Let's capture Lupin

1022
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,400
and then
take a vacation in Hawaii!

1023
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,940
Yeah!

1024
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:16,310
- Yeah, right.
- We might end up on TV!

1025
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,020
Hello.

1026
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,940
I forgot to get
to my main point.

1027
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,850
It's regarding
Emilio's manager and promoter.

1028
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,560
Got it.

1029
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:26,190
Roger that.

1030
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:27,850
I'll go ahead
and check it out.

1031
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:29,560
So what are you going to do?

1032
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:33,650
Talk about rude.

1033
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:36,400
- Find him?
- No!

1034
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,060
Maybe he headed back
without us.

1035
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:40,150
Did he only pretend to go in?

1036
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:42,400
I've had my eye on the door
the whole time.

1037
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,400
He must have meant
to lose us from the start.

1038
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,400
- But what for?
- I don't know,

1039
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,650
but we gotta find him!

1040
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:48,730
Yeah!

1041
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:54,770
You're absolutely sure
it's Emilio?

1042
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:56,150
Yeah. Uh...

1043
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:57,150
He's not here.

1044
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:59,480
I swear! It was him!

1045
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,100
So you saw the Emilio
here all alone?

1046
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:04,060
Did you say you saw Emilio?

1047
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:05,600
And who are you, Miss?

1048
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:07,690
Uh, I'm a staff member
for the tour.

1049
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:09,900
- Oh, goodness.
Then he really is around here!

1050
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:12,400
- You're a real cutie.
You know that?

1051
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,690
After that, I ran off

1052
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:15,730
to get an autograph board
for him to sign.

1053
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:17,310
While in the middle
of your shift?

1054
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,350
Uh, what are you doing, Miss?

1055
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,150
You can't go in there!

1056
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:23,400
Call the chief!

1057
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,230
You're late.

1058
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:30,230
Sorry. I still have
to buy a ticket, though.

1059
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:31,600
Hmm. Here.

1060
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:33,690
Golly! You're so nice!

1061
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:34,730
Don't mock me.

1062
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:57,150
What are you doing?!

1063
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:58,650
Emilio!

1064
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,480
What the... Ran?!

1065
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,980
Why are you here?
Don't you know it's dangerous?

1066
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,440
Stop screwing around.

1067
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,650
Stay back!

1068
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:10,980
Fine. Just tell me something.

1069
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,310
Why are you doing this?

1070
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,310
Because...

1071
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,350
I don't want to do the concert.

1072
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:21,400
Being tired
after all this makes sense.

1073
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,560
Taking some time off
should do the trick, right?

1074
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,730
I can't! Like it or not,

1075
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:28,400
this is how it is.
It can't be cancelled.

1076
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,400
No, don't say that.

1077
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,980
And don't give in!

1078
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,310
No concert is more important
than someone's life!

1079
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,520
It's crazy to even suggest it!

1080
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,400
If they can't see the show needs
to be cancelled, I'll... I'll...

1081
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,690
Whatever I do,

1082
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:47,350
you need to come away
from there, please!

1083
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:50,440
We're the only riders, huh?

1084
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,310
Hardly anyone comes up here
this late at night.

1085
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,650
Anyway, you're certain they
came to the tower, aren't you?

1086
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:58,940
Ran hasn't called
to say she's coming back yet.

1087
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:01,020
Hey, Papa, do you and your gang

1088
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:02,810
have a hideout
in this city, too?

1089
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,230
Don't think
you'll get an answer out of me

1090
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:07,560
just 'cause you ask the question
like a child.

1091
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:08,690
So you do!

1092
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:10,560
And why would you
assume that?!

1093
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:13,190
You can't do this!

1094
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:15,270
Please, I'm begging you.

1095
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:17,730
I can't imagine how you feel,

1096
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:20,350
but if you need to talk
to someone, talk to me!

1097
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,190
Just don't do this!

1098
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,600
I, uh...

1099
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:30,560
Emilio.

1100
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,020
Quick! Grab my arm!

1101
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,480
Ran, I-I...

1102
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,190
Everything's gonna be okay.

1103
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:57,150
Look, can your feet
reach that ledge?

1104
00:52:58,270 --> 00:52:59,730
Uh, yeah.

1105
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,560
Ran!

1106
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:15,190
Sonoko!

1107
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:16,980
Don't you get
all pathetic on me!

1108
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:20,650
The Ran Mori I know
is a total badass!

1109
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,400
Let's pull together!

1110
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,150
One, two...

1111
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,310
No!

1112
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:38,350
Eh?

1113
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:48,440
Sonoko!

1114
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,730
Ran!

1115
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,520
Mister, can you
open this window?!

1116
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,730
Is the girl who's dangling
that friend of yours?

1117
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:57,190
- Uh-huh.
- How thick is it?

1118
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:58,350
Double pane, ten mil.

1119
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,850
- What's going through?
- I am!

1120
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,600
Twelve shots, then!

1121
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:14,980
Ran, just don't let go
of Emilio's hand!

1122
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,310
He's getting slapped after this!

1123
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,900
How dare he drag
my best friend into this mess?!

1124
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,480
Who does he think he is?!

1125
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,850
I'll slap him so hard,

1126
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:24,980
no one will ever
call him handsome again!

1127
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:27,480
Oh, Sonoko.

1128
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:30,560
Big enough?

1129
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,900
I'm sorry, Sonoko.

1130
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,850
I can't hang on anymore.

1131
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,100
This is it.

1132
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,900
Ran.

1133
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:44,400
Ran!

1134
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,480
- Ran!
- Ran, don't let go!

1135
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:50,900
It's the brat!

1136
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,270
Conan!

1137
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:07,600
Thank you, Conan!

1138
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:11,150
- Great job!
You really came through, brat,

1139
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:13,900
so I'll grant you
a one-time-only super hug later!

1140
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:16,440
I think I'll pass on that.

1141
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,600
Sir, may I ask exactly
what it is you're doing?

1142
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:21,400
What am I doing?

1143
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:25,350
Saving people,
from the looks of it.

1144
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,310
I'm telling you,
everything's fine.

1145
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,560
Don't worry over nothing.

1146
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,440
Emilio, you almost
got yourself killed,

1147
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,690
and you put other people
in danger.

1148
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:39,940
Your actions have consequences!

1149
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:43,270
Is any of what I'm saying
sinking in?

1150
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:45,560
Use your head in the future!

1151
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,440
Please help us.

1152
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,560
We can't do this alone.

1153
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,520
Not to worry.

1154
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,900
Nothing is going
to stop that concert.

1155
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:00,560
That's good to hear.

1156
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:02,270
However, it seems to me
our favorite idol

1157
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:05,520
has been given
a touch too much freedom.

1158
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,560
I trust you're aware that
standing out in a negative way

1159
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:10,350
could interfere with the deal.

1160
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,560
Did you just call
to pass on that piece of advice?

1161
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:16,650
That, by its very nature,
creates unnecessary risk.

1162
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:19,440
Yeah. There won't be any changes

1163
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,850
to the time or place.

1164
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:24,560
Does Claudia
know about it, too?

1165
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:26,810
Yeah, she does.

1166
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,440
She's known
from the very beginning

1167
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,350
and is even helping them out.

1168
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,730
So their deal is shady.

1169
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:34,270
What does it entail?

1170
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:36,020
No clue,

1171
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:40,190
but based on how badly everybody
wants me on that concert stage,

1172
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:42,150
that's when it will go down.

1173
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:44,440
All of this started
when that Luciano guy

1174
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,150
became your promoter, right?

1175
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:48,980
Yeah, he changed everything...

1176
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:52,690
the songs, the choreo,
interactions with TV stations.

1177
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:55,690
No one even listened to my demo
before him.

1178
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:59,690
But the biggest change
was in Claudia.

1179
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:02,230
Her joy surpassed my own.

1180
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:05,690
She loves my songs more
than anyone else in the world.

1181
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:07,650
You thought
if the show got canceled,

1182
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:10,190
it'd make the conspirators
call off the deal.

1183
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:11,940
Anyway, I'm sorry.

1184
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:14,810
I really never had
any intention of jumping.

1185
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,440
No, I'm the one
who jumped to conclusions.

1186
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,940
Sorry for slapping you
the way I did.

1187
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,560
I totally get it.

1188
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:23,900
You just did it because you
cared about my well-being.

1189
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:27,940
Sorry. Forgot to give this
back to you.

1190
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,100
Yeah, that's right.

1191
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:31,100
Oh, it's Dad.

1192
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:32,730
Hey.

1193
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:34,770
Yeah. I know.

1194
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:37,850
Uh-huh. I'm with him now.

1195
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:40,480
Calm down. You don't
have to yell like that!

1196
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,600
Take a look
at this scrap of paper.

1197
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:43,900
Eh?

1198
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:45,650
It was on the floor
in your room.

1199
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:47,810
Oh. That was in my room?

1200
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:49,650
There's no use in hiding it.

1201
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:53,350
The fact is the hotel doesn't
carry Italian newspapers.

1202
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,900
And since Claudia
clearly understood the threat,

1203
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,650
all the spelling was correct.

1204
00:57:57,730 --> 00:57:59,690
In other words,
we both know the letter K

1205
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:02,400
didn't just happen
to fall off the note on its own.

1206
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,980
Good point.

1207
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,150
If a letter was missing
when she opened it,

1208
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:07,650
she would have noticed
right away.

1209
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:10,400
I also discovered
light scratches on the table.

1210
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,270
Guess you used a box cutter?

1211
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:14,100
I suppose I'm busted.

1212
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:16,650
We rarely use K
in the Italian alphabet.

1213
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:19,020
Should've trashed this.

1214
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,060
Too late, huh?

1215
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:21,520
Don't be so sure.

1216
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,980
Good hotels wait
to dispose of garbage.

1217
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:27,730
When we get back, we better
hide the cutter and newspaper.

1218
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:30,810
I should get rid of the glue
I left in there, too.

1219
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,980
- Smart.
Japanese police are top-notch.

1220
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:36,060
The tower save. Now this.

1221
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:39,100
Tell me, just who are you?

1222
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:41,100
Conan Edogawa.

1223
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:42,980
I'm a detective.

1224
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:45,690
That supposed to be
your catchphrase?

1225
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:47,100
Good to know.

1226
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,730
- Awesome.
You are one amazing kid.

1227
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:53,980
- And you've got fans waiting.
Make this concert a success.

1228
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,020
I'll ensure
this deal doesn't go down.

1229
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:01,400
Trust me. These criminals
are as good as caught.

1230
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,850
Hey!

1231
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:06,690
I've been looking
all over for you!

1232
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:09,520
You can't stroll around outside
at a time like this.

1233
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,400
Do you know
how worried I was?!

1234
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,730
Or for that matter,
how many people

1235
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:17,810
you caused trouble for
by running away?

1236
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,770
You have our thanks.

1237
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:22,480
I hate to think
what might have happened

1238
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,270
if you hadn't found him,
Mr. Mori.

1239
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:25,730
There's no need for that.

1240
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:28,270
Search-and-rescue is old hat
for me at this point.

1241
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:31,060
Emilio, he may forgive
your selfishness,

1242
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,900
but don't think
everyone will be so kind.

1243
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,270
- I'm sorry!
- Huh?

1244
00:59:34,350 --> 00:59:37,270
I've been restless
since we got to Japan.

1245
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:38,480
Won't happen again.

1246
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,730
Please forgive me, Claudia.

1247
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:42,230
I'll give my all at the concert

1248
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:43,770
to prove I'm being sincere.

1249
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:47,850
I'll make this
my best concert ever, Luciano!

1250
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:49,190
Just you watch!

1251
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,940
I think I'll head
to the staff room.

1252
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:54,810
Don't forget
the stage-prep meeting tomorrow.

1253
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,770
I won't,
but I need to apologize

1254
00:59:56,850 --> 00:59:59,060
to the staff
who know what happened.

1255
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:00,940
Yes, that's true.

1256
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:02,400
Good idea.

1257
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,940
Mr. Mori,

1258
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:11,350
what exactly did you say
to get through to Emilio?

1259
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,350
Huh? Uh...

1260
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,690
Well, let's call it
some advice on growing up.

1261
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:25,730
Hello. It is me.

1262
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:28,400
You should ditch
that hideout while you can.

1263
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,850
I have it on good authority

1264
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:31,730
that the detective brat's
little buddies

1265
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:33,350
are gonna come barging in soon.

1266
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,350
And if that were to happen,
what shall I do?

1267
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,480
They've all got
their phones turned off.

1268
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:40,850
Could they be over there?

1269
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:43,810
They went to bed early
to prep for tomorrow.

1270
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,730
Doc is already out like a light.

1271
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:48,270
- You think they...
- I hope not.

1272
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:51,600
He's pointing
right at me for some reason.

1273
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,770
They didn't...

1274
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:56,060
Yes, they did indeed.

1275
01:00:58,150 --> 01:01:01,020
We've looked up to you
for a real long time now.

1276
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:02,850
Yeah! Welcome to Japan!

1277
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:05,230
I can't even tell you
how cool this is!

1278
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:07,230
It's not much, but please...

1279
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:08,690
Take this!

1280
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:09,940
It's yummy!

1281
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:11,350
Nothing strange in there!

1282
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,480
It's all yours.

1283
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,270
I appreciate
your thoughtfulness.

1284
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:16,900
- Hear that?
- This is working like a charm.

1285
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:18,310
When he falls asleep...

1286
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,520
We'll tie him up.

1287
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,440
The square knot should do it.

1288
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,690
And after we wrangle him...

1289
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:32,150
I'll make some tea for you.

1290
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:39,440
They asleep?

1291
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,310
Never suspected a thing.

1292
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:46,060
I don't see why I had to hide
in the first place.

1293
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:48,980
Don't they know not
to take drinks from strangers?

1294
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:51,060
Some Detective League you are.

1295
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:53,600
Let's see if they
have anything valuable.

1296
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:55,060
Will you strip her, too?

1297
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:56,940
Lay off the S-word!

1298
01:01:58,230 --> 01:01:59,560
Hmm?

1299
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:00,980
Huh?

1300
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:02,480
Fujicakes!

1301
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,730
Well, this is
where we part ways.

1302
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:09,100
Because of you lot, I was
fired from the bodyguard gig,

1303
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:10,650
so it looks
like there's no reason

1304
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:12,690
for us to keep palling around.

1305
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:13,900
Catch you later.

1306
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:19,400
You're gonna do something
terrible to my friends!

1307
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:22,230
You can cry
your tear ducts dry.

1308
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:25,020
I'm not always gonna
play along with your act.

1309
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:26,900
I am the adult here.

1310
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:28,690
Thief!

1311
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:30,060
Hey, shut it!

1312
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:31,980
You know I can't
let you go on like that.

1313
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:33,400
- Crafty bastard.
- Look at this!

1314
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,810
I just received some
new information on Luciano.

1315
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:36,810
Are you listening?!

1316
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,650
The Italian mafia?

1317
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:41,020
The info's from headquarters.

1318
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:44,020
Apparently he's making
a huge deal here in Japan.

1319
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:45,690
Will Lupin show?

1320
01:02:45,770 --> 01:02:47,150
Probably.

1321
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:49,400
That sounds rather uncertain

1322
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:50,940
coming from you, Inspector.

1323
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:53,810
Is there something
not sitting right with you?

1324
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:56,440
- It's far too petty.
If he's after a jewel,

1325
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,100
then why is he interested
in ruining this deal?

1326
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:01,560
So you're saying
it's out of character.

1327
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:04,270
This guy's not the sort
he deals with.

1328
01:03:04,350 --> 01:03:06,940
Oh, he has a type, does he?

1329
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:08,060
How are you faring?

1330
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:10,150
Investigation's done,

1331
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:12,150
not that
it'll matter much anymore.

1332
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:13,770
Uh, why do you say that?

1333
01:03:13,850 --> 01:03:16,600
It seems they're not gonna
file a criminal complaint.

1334
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:19,650
- That felt off from the start.
Does it make sense

1335
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:21,980
for people who are
about to make a shady deal

1336
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:23,270
to call in the police?

1337
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:25,230
I get what you're saying.

1338
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:27,190
One of them
wants to end this mess.

1339
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:29,400
We should investigate.

1340
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,900
What are
those doohickeys?

1341
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,100
Don't know, but they're all

1342
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:35,230
grade-A gadgets,
that's for sure.

1343
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:37,650
This is the work
of a skilled artisan.

1344
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:40,350
But who the hell is giving
stuff like this to kids?

1345
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,730
Not any responsible adult.

1346
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:44,900
So, Fujicakes,
what are you doing?

1347
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:46,150
- Hmm?
- Skipping out?

1348
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:47,310
What do you mean?

1349
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,020
I'm off to crush those guys.

1350
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,900
She speaks of violence
with reckless abandon.

1351
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:53,770
It's dangerous to go alone.

1352
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:55,690
Who'll be alone, huh?

1353
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:57,980
Don't tell me
you're calling your friends.

1354
01:03:58,060 --> 01:03:59,230
Already asked.

1355
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:00,900
Where are they coming from,
you know?

1356
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:02,940
Everywhere.

1357
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:05,060
A world war in the making.

1358
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:06,600
Oh, relax.

1359
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:08,850
I promise
that I won't get in your way.

1360
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:11,060
Besides, I told my friends

1361
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:13,350
to stick to more conventional
weapons on this one.

1362
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,230
Is that meant to calm us?

1363
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:17,730
Did you at least
do some probing first?

1364
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:20,560
Like I said,
I'm not going to be in the way.

1365
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:22,730
Oh, Fujicakes!

1366
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:25,810
- Pile those kids in.
I'll drop them off as I go.

1367
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,020
Huh?

1368
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:28,520
You're going somewhere?

1369
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,400
Did you expect me
to use this dirty, old hideout?

1370
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,270
I just came by for the weapons.

1371
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,230
Let's call it quits here.

1372
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:38,440
We'll do as you say
and intercept it.

1373
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,400
At the concert venue?

1374
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,440
- Yeah.
Tell Zenigata and the cops.

1375
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,900
Then back off.

1376
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:47,810
A detective shouldn't go
any further than that.

1377
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:49,270
This is your second warning.

1378
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:51,980
You won't get a third.

1379
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:53,900
I told him I'd stop this deal,

1380
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:57,150
and I'll do it,
'cause I keep my promises!

1381
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,150
Tell that to Lupin!

1382
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:21,830
Good evening, Miss.

1383
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:23,450
Fujiko Mine.

1384
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:27,750
What should I do
with these kids?

1385
01:05:27,830 --> 01:05:31,080
The poor dears could
catch a cold being outside.

1386
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,660
It'd be great if you
could take them off my hands.

1387
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:35,250
The catch is...

1388
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:38,790
I want you to come with me
instead, if you'd please.

1389
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,330
Singing Nobleman
Emilio Baretti is here!

1390
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:57,450
Tune in, because tomorrow
we'll get to hear him sing live.

1391
01:05:57,540 --> 01:05:58,870
That's a wrap!

1392
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:00,330
Next,
let's interview some fans

1393
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:01,910
who've been waiting
in line all night.

1394
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:08,160
Making a deal
in a crowded place like that?

1395
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:09,750
I've really
gotta hand it to 'em.

1396
01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:12,870
- Yeah, it's smart.
Once the concert starts,

1397
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:16,000
every eye in the house
will be riveted on the stage.

1398
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,290
It would also seem
Luciano had a say

1399
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:20,040
in the stadium's renovations.

1400
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,080
There's a dressing room
for the backing band

1401
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,160
and a pit below the stage.

1402
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:26,660
People won't go there
while the show's going on.

1403
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:29,330
Did you hack
the stadium camera?

1404
01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:30,790
Already done.

1405
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:33,580
Do you realize
how dangerous that was?!

1406
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,370
You'd be dead

1407
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:37,120
if those weren't knockout drops!

1408
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,500
Good grief, kids!

1409
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:40,200
I can't believe
you went without me!

1410
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:41,580
Professor!

1411
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:43,120
You're right. I'm sorry.

1412
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,250
I'll handle the situation
with Ai from here on.

1413
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:47,950
- 'Kay.
- Okay.

1414
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,330
You're all grounded!

1415
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:51,000
'Kay.

1416
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:54,120
Everything's going as planned!

1417
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,950
Nothing's gonna
get in our way.

1418
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:58,410
Ai did a great job
getting in with the baddies.

1419
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,160
I wonder if Conan
will be surprised

1420
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:01,750
when he finds out!

1421
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:03,120
We'll hit
the ground running

1422
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,750
as soon as we hear from Ai!

1423
01:07:04,830 --> 01:07:05,750
Yeah!

1424
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:07,250
Jeez.

1425
01:07:09,830 --> 01:07:12,500
Yeah, I'm fine,
all things considered.

1426
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:15,500
It's quite luxurious, actually.

1427
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:18,120
All right. I'll keep
the real location to myself.

1428
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,870
The kids'll never find out.

1429
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:22,290
Sorry for the hassle, but
they won't let it go otherwise.

1430
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:24,620
Who's on the phone?
Is it that boy?

1431
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:25,870
Let me speak to him.

1432
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:27,540
Long time, no talk,

1433
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:29,160
not since the submarine.

1434
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:30,870
- He hung up.
- Aww, why?

1435
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:33,120
Maybe he'd
rather not remember.

1436
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,000
But why? I kept things PG.

1437
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,290
What are you doing?

1438
01:07:37,370 --> 01:07:38,750
Isn't that cute?

1439
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:41,660
Did your breasts shrink
with the rest of you?

1440
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:44,750
Or were they also that fun-sized
back in your "Sherry" days?

1441
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:46,830
Oh, don't be so ridiculous.

1442
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:48,750
Obviously they should
be more...

1443
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:52,000
No. I refuse to fall for this.

1444
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:56,000
Here's an idea. Why don't we
team up and perfect that drug?

1445
01:07:56,080 --> 01:08:00,450
You could bring your ideal form
of Apotoxin to fruition.

1446
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:02,790
What would you do
once it was done?

1447
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:06,450
I'd use it on myself to
rejuvenate my youthful visage.

1448
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:09,120
Eternal youth
is every woman's dream.

1449
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,370
Imagine the fortune
we'd make selling it.

1450
01:08:11,450 --> 01:08:12,750
Hate to disappoint you...

1451
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:13,950
Huh?

1452
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,250
but my creation

1453
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:17,950
isn't the miracle drug
you think it is.

1454
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,290
I'm not sure what happened
to you, but in the past,

1455
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:22,290
you were a thief
who followed her desires

1456
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:24,950
and used her wiles
to enchant men the world over.

1457
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,620
You were a woman
who'd keep racing ahead

1458
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:29,250
until she obtained her target,

1459
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:31,950
never looking back to see
who she'd left in the dust.

1460
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:35,200
When a woman
becomes a slave to youth,

1461
01:08:35,290 --> 01:08:37,580
it's all over from there.

1462
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:39,200
Right, Fujiko Mine?

1463
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:41,950
Yeah.

1464
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,000
This is too small!

1465
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,950
There'll be lots of smoke
at the top!

1466
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:46,950
Got it!

1467
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,910
Ah, looking good.

1468
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,700
The staff's teamwork
seems even better than usual.

1469
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:55,200
Emilio's enthusiasm
is very infectious.

1470
01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:58,540
Yeah. After we're done here,
we'll return to Europe.

1471
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:00,370
We deserve a vacation.

1472
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:04,330
Is the deal going
to take place in this room?

1473
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:08,950
- What's this?
You interested all of sudden?

1474
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,620
Or do you feel...

1475
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:13,330
some false sense of justice?

1476
01:09:15,370 --> 01:09:17,120
- Mr. Mori!
- Hmm?

1477
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,790
I'm sorry for calling over
such a famous detective

1478
01:09:19,870 --> 01:09:21,540
for a job like this.

1479
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:23,700
- Oh, not at all.
I choose assignments

1480
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:26,160
based on my highly refined
sense of values.

1481
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:27,910
- P.A.! Is something there?
- Tomorrow's it.

1482
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,120
I doubt we'll sleep a wink.

1483
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,660
At this point, there's
nothing left for me to do.

1484
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:35,160
Think I might grab a nightcap
and hit the sack.

1485
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:38,160
I'm thrilled to have
a bodyguard I can count on.

1486
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:40,540
- Leave it to me!
Miss Claudia is...

1487
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:42,750
- Claudia?
- Uh, what I meant was

1488
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:45,700
Emilio is in good hands with me.
Rest assured!

1489
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:52,330
Miss Claudia?

1490
01:09:52,410 --> 01:09:54,870
Ran, it's you.

1491
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:56,950
Finding it hard to relax, huh?

1492
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,250
Guess so.

1493
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:00,580
But I just can't rest

1494
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:02,790
until the stadium
is full of fans tomorrow.

1495
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:04,200
That's just how it is.

1496
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:07,120
Even though the tickets
have already sold out?

1497
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,950
As silly as this will sound,
I sometimes have nightmares

1498
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,870
of running around alone
in an empty venue.

1499
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:15,200
Where are you running to?

1500
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:16,700
I bolt to various seats,

1501
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:18,620
pretending to be
audience members.

1502
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:21,580
I guess
I'm trying to stop Emilio

1503
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:23,330
from noticing what's going on.

1504
01:10:23,410 --> 01:10:25,540
Good thing it's just a dream.

1505
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:27,450
- It's very real.
- Huh?

1506
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:30,120
Look. Someone's placing
surveys and ads

1507
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,700
for the next concert
on the seats.

1508
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:36,040
That used to be
one of my duties.

1509
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:38,700
At one of our gigs,
we had less than 30 people.

1510
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:41,540
That must have been difficult.

1511
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:43,200
You'd better believe it.

1512
01:10:43,290 --> 01:10:44,750
We were hurting for money.

1513
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,580
It was hard being
so darn powerless

1514
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:52,450
and harder still
not being able to help Emilio.

1515
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:55,000
I can only imagine.

1516
01:11:20,290 --> 01:11:22,250
Come on in.

1517
01:11:22,450 --> 01:11:24,330
Place hasn't changed one iota.

1518
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:26,950
And thankfully,
neither have my skills.

1519
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,080
I got everything
you asked for.

1520
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,500
You found an unused Walther?

1521
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:33,160
I had the grip
and trigger spring

1522
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:35,830
customized for you, too.
It's light.

1523
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:39,000
Still as good as they come.

1524
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:41,040
You'll find your payment
in the case.

1525
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,580
- That can wait.
- Huh?

1526
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:45,160
You can pay me after you've
come to an agreement

1527
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:46,910
with the client in back.

1528
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:52,750
Figures.

1529
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:54,750
No wonder I didn't notice you.

1530
01:11:54,830 --> 01:11:56,410
Sayin' I'm a ghost?

1531
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:59,200
I'm shocked
you're still in Japan.

1532
01:11:59,290 --> 01:12:01,750
You already got the sapphire,
didn't you?

1533
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:04,950
You're the same ol' King,
always in the know.

1534
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,620
It's not biz info.

1535
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:09,250
If Lupin III moves,
it's news.

1536
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:11,830
So why are you here?

1537
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:14,290
A first-class ticket
to Naples.

1538
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:16,160
You fancy going back home?

1539
01:12:17,450 --> 01:12:18,620
This a joke?

1540
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:21,120
No cameras here, pal.

1541
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:24,910
I just want you to walk away
from Luciano's job.

1542
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,370
It's not my style
to interfere with business,

1543
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:30,330
but in this case, it's a no-go.

1544
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:32,120
I'm being
a straight shooter here.

1545
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,700
Who is she?

1546
01:12:33,790 --> 01:12:35,250
- A kid.
- Eh?

1547
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:37,790
Did you mess up?

1548
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:39,040
Whatever you're thinking,

1549
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,250
let me assure you
you're dead wrong.

1550
01:12:41,330 --> 01:12:42,450
But even if you're right,

1551
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:44,330
I didn't "mess up"
as you put it.

1552
01:12:44,410 --> 01:12:46,370
For the trouble.

1553
01:12:47,410 --> 01:12:48,950
What have you got there?

1554
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,040
A shot of Yoko Okino.

1555
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,830
Wha...

1556
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:55,080
And...

1557
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:57,000
an embarrassing pic
of Fujicakes.

1558
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:06,620
All right, everyone!

1559
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:07,950
Here we go!

1560
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:09,540
I need to hit the bathroom.

1561
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:11,000
You know, I do, too!

1562
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:13,500
I'll be on duty
guarding him from the wings.

1563
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:16,250
Guess I'm on my own,
but such is life.

1564
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:28,500
Sing it, Emilio!

1565
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:47,700
Strange. I haven't seen
Lupin or Luciano anywhere.

1566
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:50,080
Our last sighting
of Luciano was...

1567
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,500
here.

1568
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:55,080
- It's from a half an hour ago.
- Details?

1569
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,040
It's a door that leads
straight to the basement,

1570
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:00,080
but no cars
have left the parking lot.

1571
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:02,000
Check this out.

1572
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,040
The underground corridor
has been extended.

1573
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:05,450
But why?

1574
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:08,200
Apparently,
it's a secret V.I.P. passage.

1575
01:14:08,290 --> 01:14:10,450
How'd we miss this
during our search?

1576
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:40,830
Could you see me?

1577
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:43,120
No sight of you
entering the underground tunnel.

1578
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:46,410
They duped us! It runs
alongside a local street.

1579
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:49,870
Wait! What about the cameras
from this parking lot?

1580
01:14:49,950 --> 01:14:52,040
From that location?

1581
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:55,540
No good.
Your car is just out of sight.

1582
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:57,160
Try playing back the footage.

1583
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:59,410
We may be able to tell
which direction he went.

1584
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:00,750
Smart thinking.

1585
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:03,660
Checking the cars that went by.

1586
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:04,660
What the...

1587
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:05,830
Look.

1588
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:08,290
I-It's Conan.

1589
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:10,080
Conan?

1590
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:16,250
He's not picking up.

1591
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:19,750
- What a kid.
He always run off like this?

1592
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:22,700
Usually,
but this is different.

1593
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:26,120
Surely, I can't be the only one
who's picked up on that, right?

1594
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,450
What's the move?

1595
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:31,750
You two use that technology
to track the boy.

1596
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:33,450
Me...

1597
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:36,830
I'll do some sleuthing
using my gut.

1598
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:44,540
So he knew all along.

1599
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:46,830
Emilio never lost his faith.

1600
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:48,830
He believed in you, Claudia.

1601
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:51,700
And he doesn't want you
to do any more wrong,

1602
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:54,450
whether on his behalf
or otherwise.

1603
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:56,330
Let's see.

1604
01:15:56,410 --> 01:15:59,790
20 daikon radishes,
some cabbages, wha...

1605
01:15:59,870 --> 01:16:02,330
and a broken cash register?

1606
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:04,160
Hello. This is Takagi,

1607
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:06,660
the dummy who screwed things up
while on the Lupin case,

1608
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:08,830
and is now being punished
by sorting out expenses.

1609
01:16:08,910 --> 01:16:10,500
How may I assist you?

1610
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:13,120
Oh, and I finished
the written apology.

1611
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:14,540
What apology?

1612
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:16,250
Is Officer Takagi there?

1613
01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:17,910
Oh, it's just you guys!

1614
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,750
What can I do for you?

1615
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:21,870
- Huh?!
- Heads up.

1616
01:16:21,950 --> 01:16:23,080
There are more receipts.

1617
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:25,660
Sorry! Can you
take care of the rest?

1618
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:27,330
- What?!
You've gotta be kidding!

1619
01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:30,870
I knew he was the one
to call at a time like this.

1620
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:32,830
Yeah!
He actually believes us!

1621
01:16:32,910 --> 01:16:34,450
Ai is such a meanie!

1622
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:36,500
Why would she give us
the wrong address?

1623
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:39,330
Maybe she received
some diabolical threat,

1624
01:16:39,410 --> 01:16:41,450
forcing her
to give out misinformation.

1625
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:43,160
We have to hurry and save her!

1626
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:45,580
But Conan told us
to leave things to him!

1627
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:48,830
First let's meet
with Officer Takagi.

1628
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:50,540
Then we'll
catch those bad guys!

1629
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:51,620
Yeah!

1630
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:55,870
- Hmm.
- What wrong?

1631
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:59,080
You've been using my computer
for a good while now.

1632
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,080
Sending your friends
false info?

1633
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:03,200
I don't wanna put them
in danger, so yes.

1634
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:05,790
Betrayal comes easy
to you, then?

1635
01:17:05,870 --> 01:17:08,200
Like how you betrayed
your organization?

1636
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:12,950
- Oh, well.
Don't let it get you down.

1637
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,950
Betrayal is
a woman's greatest asset.

1638
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,540
You're leaving?

1639
01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:19,290
Yup. You're free to go.

1640
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:23,450
A thief who uses her wiles
to enchant men the world over

1641
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:25,450
can't abide
being tricked by one.

1642
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:27,160
Wanna come?

1643
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:29,200
There'll be lots of danger.

1644
01:17:34,410 --> 01:17:37,450
Ah, so we meet
in person, at last.

1645
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:40,450
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Mr. Luciano.

1646
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:43,040
As you know, I am Alan Smithee.

1647
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,580
Alan Smithee, huh?

1648
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,950
So he's the one
on the other side of this deal?

1649
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:50,330
Luciano's only mentioned
the name to me once before.

1650
01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:52,750
Did he say where
the deal would be happening?

1651
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:56,660
No, he hasn't
given that information out

1652
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:58,250
to anyone to my knowledge.

1653
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:02,370
I see.

1654
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:05,120
You kept it here at the airport
as spare equipment.

1655
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,620
Yes. It's treated as goods

1656
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:08,370
that have yet
to enter the country.

1657
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:11,830
But even if someone
were to peek inside,

1658
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:14,620
they wouldn't find much.

1659
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:22,330
What have we here? A keyboard?

1660
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:24,830
I think
what you're looking for...

1661
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:26,620
are these.

1662
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:28,330
Quite easy to process.

1663
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:31,750
Then we've reached
the end of our arrangement.

1664
01:18:34,290 --> 01:18:38,080
As agreed upon,
the Cherry Sapphire is yours.

1665
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:41,000
- Sapphire?
What the hell is that?

1666
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:42,910
Is this some kind of a joke?

1667
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,290
What do you mean?

1668
01:18:46,830 --> 01:18:50,910
You sure picked a complicated
place to hide it in.

1669
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,660
Take it easy on me next time.

1670
01:18:57,830 --> 01:18:59,120
A fake!

1671
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:06,660
Eh? Huh?

1672
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:15,200
Remember what I told you?

1673
01:19:15,290 --> 01:19:17,370
The next time we met,
I'd take you in.

1674
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:19,660
You're always so brash, kid.

1675
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:22,910
I'm pretty sure Papa told you
to quit playing detective.

1676
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,080
Damn it.

1677
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:26,000
Back-stabbing scum!

1678
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:27,830
You did fire me.

1679
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:30,830
This, kid,
is a special last chance.

1680
01:19:30,910 --> 01:19:32,870
Walk away now,
and as a farewell gift,

1681
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:34,080
I'll forget you were here.

1682
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:35,450
You idiot.

1683
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:37,580
There's no way
I'm gonna overlook this.

1684
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:40,580
Ever fired one of those?

1685
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:42,040
'Course I have.

1686
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:44,910
I learned how to shoot
at a firing range in Hawaii.

1687
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,700
What's going on here?

1688
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:48,330
What's all
this jewel business?!

1689
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:51,830
It would seem we were set up.

1690
01:19:51,910 --> 01:19:54,660
Do you know a man
by the name of Kein Gejidasu?

1691
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:57,040
Kein?! Who is that?

1692
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,620
Never heard of him!

1693
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:01,290
This is on me.

1694
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:04,290
Kein Gejidasu, huh?

1695
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:07,830
So you figured it out,
Detective Nerdling.

1696
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:10,660
And I'm impressed
you found out about this place.

1697
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:13,000
Know how?

1698
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:14,080
Later.

1699
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:17,580
That's right. Terminate them.

1700
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:24,120
This is just your scene.

1701
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:28,040
Secret Sword! Reverse Tornado!

1702
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:33,660
Hey, Goemon, now things
are twice as dangerous!

1703
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:35,200
My bad.

1704
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:37,370
No time to dwell on that now.

1705
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:43,910
Out of the way!

1706
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:56,330
The unworthy
are cut down without mercy.

1707
01:20:56,410 --> 01:20:58,790
You've got nothin' on me!

1708
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:03,450
Lupin, you're under arrest!

1709
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:06,000
The brakes
aren't working!

1710
01:21:10,790 --> 01:21:12,330
- Don't move!
- Hands in the air!

1711
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:13,450
There's more of you?!

1712
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:20,120
- That's my Jigen!
- You're better than ever!

1713
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,500
It wasn't me.

1714
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:23,540
Nor was it by my hand.

1715
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:24,910
Well, duh.

1716
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,160
But who was it then?

1717
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:27,950
Freeze!

1718
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,410
I got you, Lupin.

1719
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:37,330
I'm Jodie Starling
with the FBI, perp,

1720
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:39,910
and as of this moment,
you're in my custody.

1721
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,040
A shootout at Haneda?

1722
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,910
Turns out
the former maintenance area

1723
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,290
doubles as a parking apron
for private jets.

1724
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:49,790
So that was his getaway plan.

1725
01:21:49,870 --> 01:21:52,250
Areas A, B, and C are clear!

1726
01:21:52,330 --> 01:21:54,200
- Mm-hmm.
Guard up, all the same.

1727
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:55,790
You know
who we're dealing with.

1728
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:59,160
Why would the FBI
be poking its nose into this?

1729
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:01,700
Because I called them.

1730
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:04,700
Did you really think I'd come
to a dangerous place like this

1731
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:06,040
without some backup?

1732
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:08,370
I can't get a good shot.

1733
01:22:08,450 --> 01:22:10,290
He's standing in the way
on purpose.

1734
01:22:10,370 --> 01:22:13,160
We get to call our own shots
while we're in the country,

1735
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:16,040
so my partner and I figured
it wouldn't be a bad idea

1736
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:18,580
to put the Japanese police
in our debt by apprehending

1737
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:20,790
an internationally wanted
felon like you.

1738
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:23,790
Okay, you can go ahead
and cuff him, Jodie.

1739
01:22:23,870 --> 01:22:24,790
Got you.

1740
01:22:24,870 --> 01:22:26,120
Now you behave, hear?

1741
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,200
I will!

1742
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:29,910
Wait!

1743
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,620
Be extra careful

1744
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:33,200
when you touch him.
You never know

1745
01:22:33,290 --> 01:22:34,950
what he's got
planted on his body.

1746
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,500
You little brat.

1747
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:39,450
I want both hands
behind your head,

1748
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:40,660
you on your knees,

1749
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:41,950
- and no funny business!
- Yeah, yeah.

1750
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:45,450
And just to ensure
you behave...

1751
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:46,750
nighty-night.

1752
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:49,250
You despicable runt.

1753
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:07,700
Bastard!

1754
01:23:07,790 --> 01:23:08,910
Enough!

1755
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:15,330
If you want to shoot me,
go right ahead. Do it.

1756
01:23:15,410 --> 01:23:18,290
Even if you get me in the head,
the trigger will fire.

1757
01:23:19,330 --> 01:23:21,750
As for the boy, well...

1758
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:24,120
I'll be taking the case.

1759
01:23:27,290 --> 01:23:29,250
Everyone hold your positions.

1760
01:23:29,330 --> 01:23:31,580
All of you back away from me

1761
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:33,120
as far as possible.

1762
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:38,000
Don't make me shoot him!

1763
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,290
All right, all right.

1764
01:23:39,370 --> 01:23:41,000
Let's all keep our heads here.

1765
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:44,040
Isn't this your chance, brat?

1766
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:48,200
Huh?

1767
01:23:48,290 --> 01:23:49,750
Alan, please wait!

1768
01:23:49,830 --> 01:23:51,500
What about the money
you promised me?

1769
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:52,750
Wasn't that our deal?

1770
01:23:52,830 --> 01:23:54,450
Pilot, are you hearing me?

1771
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:56,200
-Yes, sir.
-Start the engine.

1772
01:23:56,290 --> 01:23:58,080
- We're leaving.
-Roger.

1773
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:00,450
- Take the case.
You'll find money inside.

1774
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:01,660
Bring the car!

1775
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:03,500
Right. Just a sec!

1776
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:08,750
This is Sato.

1777
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:10,040
We'll be there in three minutes.

1778
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:11,500
Please have
the gate open for us!

1779
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:14,000
Takagi, why the hell
are you here?!

1780
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,620
Oh, it's, uh, well, you see...

1781
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:17,120
Step on it, Doc!

1782
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:18,790
They're gonna beat us
to the action!

1783
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:21,200
Officer Takagi's with us,
so we'll be fine!

1784
01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:22,500
Then let's go!

1785
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:24,620
Let's not. This is bad!

1786
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:27,160
Civilian car, let us pass!

1787
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,580
So where'd you park yours?

1788
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:35,660
Why would we have driven
a noisy car to an ambush?

1789
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:37,750
I just called for a chopper.

1790
01:24:37,830 --> 01:24:39,450
They're gonna escape.

1791
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,040
Hey, what if
they start shooting?

1792
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,700
Put the gun down.

1793
01:24:45,790 --> 01:24:47,580
They wouldn't dare shoot.

1794
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:49,790
Start up. We're taking off now.

1795
01:24:49,870 --> 01:24:51,580
Ignore traffic control.

1796
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:56,540
My poor Alfa Romeo.

1797
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:59,290
- What's your plan now?
You gonna run after them?

1798
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:00,450
Not a clue.

1799
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:01,540
- Lupin!
- Hmm?

1800
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:03,080
Fujicakes!

1801
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:04,950
- Who?
- Fujiko Mine...

1802
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:08,290
bust 99, waist 55,
and her hips 88.

1803
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:11,160
Oh, and she's also
an internationally wanted felon.

1804
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:13,580
Ohh.

1805
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:15,410
We miss the party?

1806
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:18,450
- Not at all.
Party's just starting.

1807
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:27,250
Lupin and the FBI.

1808
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:30,040
They both backed off,
all to keep you safe.

1809
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,660
But why?

1810
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:33,580
Just who are you, kid?

1811
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,700
Why am I the one
who has to steer?!

1812
01:25:47,790 --> 01:25:49,750
Would you like
to shoot instead?

1813
01:25:49,830 --> 01:25:51,540
Don't worry.
This won't take long.

1814
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:53,250
Hold your fire there,
Fujicakes!

1815
01:25:53,330 --> 01:25:55,250
The brat's still
onboard that plane, you know!

1816
01:25:55,330 --> 01:25:56,700
And your point being?

1817
01:25:56,790 --> 01:25:58,120
If you're gonna blow them up,

1818
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:00,120
I'll have no choice
but to make a sharp turn

1819
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:02,830
- and crash this bike!
- Tell me the drug's secret,

1820
01:26:02,910 --> 01:26:04,580
and it won't come to that.

1821
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:08,000
It's a deal.

1822
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,160
In that case...

1823
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:10,830
That was
a perfectly good weapon!

1824
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:13,410
I'll be using these. Floor it!

1825
01:26:14,410 --> 01:26:15,410
Shift up!

1826
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:17,910
Wow.

1827
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,250
You're full of surprises,
"Sherry."

1828
01:26:19,330 --> 01:26:21,700
I used to own a Harley
back in the day.

1829
01:26:21,790 --> 01:26:22,790
What's the big deal?

1830
01:26:25,330 --> 01:26:28,000
Keep your eyes on him
at all times.

1831
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:29,080
Right.

1832
01:26:30,330 --> 01:26:31,870
- All right, then.
Let's take off.

1833
01:26:31,950 --> 01:26:34,000
We're getting
some push-back from control.

1834
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,580
GB27! Please stop at once!

1835
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:38,410
An aircraft
is making its approach!

1836
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:40,290
- JNA301...
- GB27!

1837
01:26:40,370 --> 01:26:41,790
- it is not safe to land!
- GB27!

1838
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:49,910
You're not gonna do
what I think you are...

1839
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,620
A head-on collision
will stop them!

1840
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:54,450
Why'd I sign up for this?

1841
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:56,620
We're at V1.

1842
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:57,790
Then take off.

1843
01:27:03,370 --> 01:27:05,290
Time to fly!

1844
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:25,660
- Gear up.
- Gear up.

1845
01:27:26,790 --> 01:27:29,160
JNA pilot, are you hearing me?

1846
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:31,580
Just keep flying.
We'll avoid you.

1847
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:42,290
I need ambulances
at the former maintenance area.

1848
01:27:42,370 --> 01:27:43,580
We've got a lot of wounded!

1849
01:27:43,660 --> 01:27:45,830
Why won't
you guys let us in?!

1850
01:27:45,910 --> 01:27:47,500
I guess it's a no-go.

1851
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:49,250
We've got
an officer in here!

1852
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:50,580
Easy with that.

1853
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:52,000
Yeah, give it
to 'em straight, Takagi!

1854
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:53,410
It's great
to hear your voice, Ai!

1855
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:54,950
- Are you safe?
- Give what to 'em?

1856
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:56,080
Show these guys your badge!

1857
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:58,330
Say that again!

1858
01:27:58,410 --> 01:27:59,870
Conan's on board a what?

1859
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:05,830
What are
they doing in that cockpit?!

1860
01:28:05,910 --> 01:28:07,290
I know, right?

1861
01:28:07,370 --> 01:28:10,120
The bastards nearly threw me
clear off this thing.

1862
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:11,330
What?!

1863
01:28:16,410 --> 01:28:18,450
You're just full of tricks,
aren't you, brat?

1864
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:19,540
Huh?

1865
01:28:20,910 --> 01:28:23,500
But don't you think
all that subterfuge

1866
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:24,870
was just a tad overdone?

1867
01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:26,620
- I'm lost.
- Try caught.

1868
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:30,370
A shootout that big, but not
a single person ends up dead?

1869
01:28:30,450 --> 01:28:32,790
The FBI must have
been placed just so

1870
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:35,370
and by none other
than you, right?

1871
01:28:35,450 --> 01:28:37,700
You kept the power balance
of the field in mind

1872
01:28:37,790 --> 01:28:40,370
so there'd be no fatal injuries.

1873
01:28:40,450 --> 01:28:41,370
Gah!

1874
01:28:41,450 --> 01:28:43,120
Killjoy!

1875
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,790
If you'd have let
those pesky pricks

1876
01:28:44,870 --> 01:28:46,830
perforate each other,
this would've been over!

1877
01:28:46,910 --> 01:28:48,580
You would have liked that,
wouldn't you?

1878
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:51,000
Damn right,
and I almost got my wish!

1879
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:53,830
Wanna leave the rest
to me, too?

1880
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:57,080
Just don't blame me if this
doesn't go the way you want.

1881
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:01,750
So you got it at last,
Captain!

1882
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:05,120
Yes. Now Jiranba
can fight as well.

1883
01:29:18,950 --> 01:29:21,370
Wow! Talk about
having a thick skull.

1884
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:24,910
Idiot!

1885
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:32,910
Don't even try it!

1886
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,620
He brought this fate
on himself!

1887
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:46,540
We can't let things end
with a tie now, can we?

1888
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:51,500
We'll be fine.
I can smell the sea breeze.

1889
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:53,950
You do realize
we could have just died?

1890
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:55,500
Then let's go thank the pilot.

1891
01:30:01,450 --> 01:30:04,540
Respect for keeping
the craft under control.

1892
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:05,790
I'll take over.

1893
01:30:07,450 --> 01:30:10,290
The throttle is still intact.

1894
01:30:10,370 --> 01:30:13,620
But the wing and tail controls
are heavy.

1895
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:15,700
Copy that. Hey, brat...

1896
01:30:15,790 --> 01:30:17,200
No oil pressure.

1897
01:30:17,290 --> 01:30:19,330
The plane has a backup
on board, doesn't it?

1898
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:21,910
How curious.

1899
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,200
Tell me, who are you, really?

1900
01:30:25,290 --> 01:30:27,580
Just rest. Got it? The kid's...

1901
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:29,080
Shinichi Kudo.

1902
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:31,450
I'm a high school detective.

1903
01:30:31,540 --> 01:30:33,620
A high schooler.

1904
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:36,410
You're still...

1905
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:37,870
capable...

1906
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:39,040
of doing...

1907
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:40,540
anything.

1908
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:45,080
There are many young people...

1909
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:47,040
in my country, too.

1910
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:49,540
Right now,

1911
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:51,370
his country
is basically being treated

1912
01:30:51,450 --> 01:30:53,910
as a lowly colony
by a neighboring state,

1913
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,500
one with vast military power.

1914
01:30:57,700 --> 01:31:00,290
I wonder
what his real name was?

1915
01:31:00,370 --> 01:31:02,450
"Alan Smithee"
is only a pseudonym.

1916
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:03,910
Who cares in the end?

1917
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,290
"Alan Smithee" works.

1918
01:31:06,370 --> 01:31:08,080
They're shooting it down?!

1919
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:10,700
The order came directly
from the Jiranban embassy.

1920
01:31:10,790 --> 01:31:12,330
Please, you have
got to listen to me!

1921
01:31:12,410 --> 01:31:14,290
There's a boy aboard that plane!

1922
01:31:14,370 --> 01:31:17,500
Connect me to Superintendent
Matsumoto on the double!

1923
01:31:19,370 --> 01:31:21,330
We're flying ahead
to Hachijo Island.

1924
01:31:21,410 --> 01:31:24,620
Wouldn't you rather
go back to Haneda and surrender?

1925
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:25,750
The feds are there.

1926
01:31:25,830 --> 01:31:27,330
You're hilarious.

1927
01:31:27,410 --> 01:31:29,080
I wouldn't do that.

1928
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:31,450
Shoot me,
and down goes this birdie, runt.

1929
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:34,080
Oh, I think
I'll find a way to manage.

1930
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:36,620
Puh-lease! I'm doing
my damndest to fly this.

1931
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:37,870
It ain't easy.

1932
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:39,950
Focus on fixing
the comms and radar.

1933
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:41,700
Yeah, yeah.

1934
01:31:41,790 --> 01:31:45,330
After I fix this,
are you gonna radio Vespania?

1935
01:31:48,330 --> 01:31:50,750
Now, what an interesting thing
to suggest.

1936
01:31:50,830 --> 01:31:52,450
When'd you find out?

1937
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:55,200
To be honest,
I've suspected the Vespanian ore

1938
01:31:55,290 --> 01:31:58,330
was part of the deal
for a while now.

1939
01:31:58,410 --> 01:32:00,750
Back at the hotel,
your buddy Daisuke Jigen

1940
01:32:00,830 --> 01:32:02,790
had his dowsing bars out.

1941
01:32:02,870 --> 01:32:04,750
I take it
he was trying to use them

1942
01:32:04,830 --> 01:32:06,500
to search for the Vespanian ore.

1943
01:32:06,580 --> 01:32:09,200
He showed 'em off
back in Vespania.

1944
01:32:09,290 --> 01:32:11,000
Why would he do that?

1945
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:14,830
But that's not enough to be sure
Vespanian ore was involved.

1946
01:32:14,910 --> 01:32:16,000
Not at the time, no.

1947
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:17,500
When he opened the case,

1948
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:20,500
he checked to see
if it was the real thing, right?

1949
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:23,160
- Who checked?
What are you on about?

1950
01:32:23,250 --> 01:32:25,620
Jigen was
releasing microwaves.

1951
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:29,330
In trace amounts, sure,
but enough to dim the lights.

1952
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:31,330
Should I start from the top?

1953
01:32:31,410 --> 01:32:32,750
Why not?

1954
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:34,330
Make it a good deduction,

1955
01:32:34,410 --> 01:32:36,330
since it might be
your final one.

1956
01:32:37,830 --> 01:32:40,370
It's hardly even worth
calling a deduction.

1957
01:32:40,450 --> 01:32:42,410
More like child's play.

1958
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:44,870
The Cherry Sapphire
was entrusted to the bank

1959
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:46,580
by Eishin Wakagomo.

1960
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:50,080
And there was the name mentioned
during the deal earlier.

1961
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:52,950
Do you know a man
by the name of Kein Gejidasu?

1962
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:55,370
Kein?! Who is that?

1963
01:32:55,450 --> 01:32:58,870
"Eishin Wakagomo"
is Goemon Ishikawa,

1964
01:32:58,950 --> 01:33:01,620
and "Kein Gejidasu"
is Daisuke Jigen.

1965
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:03,120
They're anagrams.

1966
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:06,000
You couldn't have been
any cleverer than that?

1967
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:09,410
Even the Junior Detective League
saw through "Eishin Wakagomo."

1968
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:11,250
That's made them
so overconfident

1969
01:33:11,330 --> 01:33:13,330
that they barged
into your hideout.

1970
01:33:13,410 --> 01:33:14,870
What a rude accusation.

1971
01:33:14,950 --> 01:33:18,080
Jigen and Goemon wracked
their brains on those names.

1972
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:20,410
- So there.
- Back to what I was saying.

1973
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:23,200
You then went to the trouble
of stealing the Cherry Sapphire

1974
01:33:23,290 --> 01:33:25,750
after having Goemon
put it in the bank.

1975
01:33:25,830 --> 01:33:29,450
What's more, Jigen,
aka Kein Gejidasu,

1976
01:33:29,540 --> 01:33:30,830
listed the Cherry Sapphire

1977
01:33:30,910 --> 01:33:32,750
as a condition
for the deal with Alan.

1978
01:33:32,830 --> 01:33:35,250
And who did he recommend
to steal it?

1979
01:33:35,330 --> 01:33:38,120
Why, none other
than Lupin III.

1980
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:39,580
To put it another way,

1981
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:42,450
your true objective
was never the Cherry Sapphire.

1982
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:44,790
You wanted to get close
to Alan, whose obsession

1983
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:47,620
was trying to obtain
the stolen Vespanian ore.

1984
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:50,410
After doing so,
you'd simply figure out

1985
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,830
who he was trying
to buy the ore from,

1986
01:33:52,910 --> 01:33:55,620
and then it would be
a matter of stealing it back.

1987
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:57,290
And if that Cherry Sapphire

1988
01:33:57,370 --> 01:33:59,290
happened to be yours
from the start,

1989
01:33:59,370 --> 01:34:02,120
I'm sure
it came with a homing device.

1990
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:04,200
I honed in
on the signal with this,

1991
01:34:04,290 --> 01:34:06,620
which is also how I knew
where the deal would go down.

1992
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:08,870
Incidentally, I have a hunch

1993
01:34:08,950 --> 01:34:11,750
Fujiko Mine was in on the plan
to take back the ore.

1994
01:34:11,830 --> 01:34:14,000
If you need more proof
about the ore,

1995
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,040
its theft was
all over the Internet.

1996
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:17,410
You've lost it!

1997
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:19,620
Returning stolen rocks
does not a payday make,

1998
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:22,330
so why indulge
in profitless actions?

1999
01:34:22,410 --> 01:34:23,700
You can deny it,

2000
01:34:23,790 --> 01:34:25,910
but I'm positive
you tried to get it back.

2001
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,750
The question is why.

2002
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:30,410
No clue. I wish
you'd stop with the riddles.

2003
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:31,910
Well...

2004
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:36,620
the late Queen Sakura
of Vespania gave her life

2005
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:39,410
to protect
her country's reserves of ore.

2006
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:43,370
I'm sure her daughter
reached out for help.

2007
01:34:43,450 --> 01:34:46,540
You remember her, don't you,
that tomboy princess?

2008
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:48,200
If you'd only been
a little faster

2009
01:34:48,290 --> 01:34:51,040
at working out the fact
that Luciano had stolen the ore,

2010
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:52,910
you wouldn't have
had to sneak into Japan

2011
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,660
and have
that big shootout, right?

2012
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:57,120
So I wasn't on my A game.

2013
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:58,290
Sue me.

2014
01:34:58,370 --> 01:34:59,700
Though I only did it

2015
01:34:59,790 --> 01:35:01,950
so I could link up
with a cheeky Great Detective.

2016
01:35:03,790 --> 01:35:05,870
You're incorrigible.

2017
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:09,040
Okay, this should work for now.

2018
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:10,080
Appreciate it.

2019
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:13,250
You know how this goes.

2020
01:35:13,330 --> 01:35:15,830
"You know too much,"
yadda-yadda.

2021
01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:18,910
Your image
is important in our world.

2022
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,830
If people knew Lupin III
was helping someone...

2023
01:35:21,910 --> 01:35:24,000
I might have actually
taken you seriously

2024
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:25,950
if you'd have cocked
the Walther first.

2025
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:27,000
Talk about lame.

2026
01:35:30,910 --> 01:35:32,830
Eagle One
to operations center.

2027
01:35:32,910 --> 01:35:35,700
Final code is 1027. Confirm.

2028
01:35:35,790 --> 01:35:37,950
Final code confirmed.

2029
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:39,870
You have the all-clear
to fire the missile.

2030
01:35:39,950 --> 01:35:41,200
I repeat...

2031
01:35:41,290 --> 01:35:43,450
you are cleared
to fire the missile.

2032
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:45,700
The Vespanian royal family?

2033
01:35:45,790 --> 01:35:49,160
If we can't get it back,
we'll have to go to plan B.

2034
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:50,700
Which is?

2035
01:35:50,790 --> 01:35:53,040
Destroying the ore
before it leaves Japan.

2036
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:54,450
Simple as that.

2037
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:56,830
You should have prepared
for this! Come on, man!

2038
01:35:56,910 --> 01:35:58,500
Yeah, but who could
prepare for you?!

2039
01:35:58,580 --> 01:36:00,120
You disguised yourself as Kid!

2040
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:01,870
Of course I'd come after you!

2041
01:36:01,950 --> 01:36:04,370
Only 'cause you
can't take a joke!

2042
01:36:04,450 --> 01:36:05,700
Huh?

2043
01:36:05,790 --> 01:36:06,910
It's coming!

2044
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,250
Maximum throttle!

2045
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:12,370
- We've got chaff!
- Fire!

2046
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:17,660
Attacking Eagle,

2047
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:19,120
this is the Jiranban plane!

2048
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:20,580
Do you co...

2049
01:36:20,660 --> 01:36:22,700
The target
has countered with chaff.

2050
01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:24,580
The missile
did not hit its mark.

2051
01:36:24,660 --> 01:36:25,830
This is a joint demand

2052
01:36:25,910 --> 01:36:29,160
from Vespania
and the Jiranba Republic.

2053
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:31,000
Release an AAM10!

2054
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:32,830
Roger!

2055
01:36:32,910 --> 01:36:34,660
They're going
for the kill this time.

2056
01:36:34,750 --> 01:36:37,330
And we're all out
of defenses! Eh?

2057
01:36:37,410 --> 01:36:39,540
That there
is the Cherry Sapphire.

2058
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:42,080
I personally carved
that beauty out of rock.

2059
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:43,450
Hold on.

2060
01:36:45,950 --> 01:36:47,830
Did you carve it
out ofthatrock?

2061
01:36:47,910 --> 01:36:50,540
Sure did! The one
that Fujiko brought back!

2062
01:36:50,620 --> 01:36:52,370
It was pure Vespanian ore.

2063
01:36:54,410 --> 01:36:55,830
Get to the high-voltage panel
in the bay!

2064
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:57,330
On it!

2065
01:36:57,410 --> 01:36:59,410
It's used for more
than just stealth.

2066
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:00,700
Apply a certain voltage,

2067
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:02,950
and it nullifies
electronics, too.

2068
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:05,040
If something like that
fell into the hands

2069
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:06,910
of a military state,
the world's...

2070
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,790
...balance of
military power would collapse.

2071
01:37:09,870 --> 01:37:11,450
That's it!

2072
01:37:22,830 --> 01:37:24,500
What's the holdup, you brat?!

2073
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:25,500
You taking a nap?!

2074
01:37:25,580 --> 01:37:27,160
Crap!

2075
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:33,200
- Heads up!
They've locked on to us!

2076
01:37:33,290 --> 01:37:36,580
We have to ascend,
then do a free fall!

2077
01:37:36,660 --> 01:37:38,870
I see what you're driving at.

2078
01:37:46,450 --> 01:37:48,450
Hang on tight now, brat!

2079
01:37:53,790 --> 01:37:55,410
A little more.

2080
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:57,080
Just one chance.

2081
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:00,450
Let's go!

2082
01:38:10,370 --> 01:38:11,580
Don't miss.

2083
01:38:22,790 --> 01:38:24,450
-The controls!
- What the...

2084
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:28,950
- Scrub the mission!
Eagle One, do you copy?

2085
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:30,290
Scrub the mission!

2086
01:38:30,370 --> 01:38:32,200
There are civilians
aboard the craft!

2087
01:38:32,290 --> 01:38:34,330
Abort the termination mission
immediately!

2088
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:39,910
Eagle One, roger! But look!

2089
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,410
The target is plummeting
along with a mysterious light.

2090
01:39:01,330 --> 01:39:04,080
A boat?!

2091
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:06,540
This is Eagle One.
I have just spotted

2092
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:08,330
a lone parachute.

2093
01:39:08,410 --> 01:39:11,620
Confirming location
at point 0925.

2094
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,450
It looks like they saw us.

2095
01:39:17,540 --> 01:39:19,830
Even better,
they're not shooting at us.

2096
01:39:19,910 --> 01:39:22,870
Well, I guess
your FBI buddies are waiting?

2097
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:24,790
Or the Maritime
Self-Defense Force?

2098
01:39:24,870 --> 01:39:27,290
- Come on. Lighten up.
I didn't go that far.

2099
01:39:27,370 --> 01:39:29,120
No way, brat!

2100
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:30,620
Lousy snitch! Get off!

2101
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:32,450
- Hey, cut it out! Ow! Quit it!
- Fall!

2102
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:34,830
- You're hurting my arms! Ow!
- You're like a squid!

2103
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:46,080
Emilio! Emilio!

2104
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:49,080
- Emilio! Emilio!
- Encore! Encore!

2105
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:51,830
Emilio! Emilio!

2106
01:39:51,910 --> 01:39:53,370
- Hmm?
- Emilio!

2107
01:39:53,450 --> 01:39:55,870
- Did you see?
- Emilio!

2108
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:59,080
- Yes. You were great.
- Emilio! Emilio!

2109
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:01,700
- Would you keep...
- Encore!

2110
01:40:01,790 --> 01:40:03,330
standing by my side,
watching me?

2111
01:40:03,410 --> 01:40:04,750
Encore!

2112
01:40:04,830 --> 01:40:07,620
- Get out there.
- Encore!

2113
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:10,620
It's where
you belong, truly.

2114
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:11,950
Encore!

2115
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:14,120
- Encore!
- Encore!

2116
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:15,620
Okay, let's go!

2117
01:40:15,700 --> 01:40:17,450
Mm-hmm.

2118
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:18,750
Mm-hmm.

2119
01:40:18,830 --> 01:40:21,620
I see. Excellent.

2120
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:25,750
Inspector, because of you,
I could watch to the end.

2121
01:40:25,830 --> 01:40:27,870
Thank you for all you've done.

2122
01:40:27,950 --> 01:40:30,000
What's this?

2123
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,250
You going away?

2124
01:40:31,330 --> 01:40:32,330
Eh?

2125
01:40:33,330 --> 01:40:35,120
Aww, man.

2126
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:37,790
Everything ended up
at the bottom of the damn ocean.

2127
01:40:37,870 --> 01:40:39,750
I hate when it ends that way.

2128
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:42,950
That's a creepy look.

2129
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:45,250
You wanna tell me
what that smirk is all about?

2130
01:40:45,330 --> 01:40:48,500
Don't act like you're
not hiding a smile deep down.

2131
01:40:48,580 --> 01:40:50,370
But I understand why.

2132
01:40:50,450 --> 01:40:53,120
Helping others
can be embarrassing, too.

2133
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:55,750
I have to say,
it's like a phantom thief

2134
01:40:55,830 --> 01:40:58,250
has forced open a door
deep into your heart.

2135
01:40:58,330 --> 01:41:00,330
Idiot.

2136
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:06,950
Th-This submarine...

2137
01:41:08,660 --> 01:41:12,000
Bringing back bad memories?

2138
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,080
Hi! You boys doing okay?

2139
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:19,660
Did something
really go down between you two?

2140
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:23,040
Man, do I hate
cramped places.

2141
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:24,540
Yes, agreed.

2142
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:27,200
I see
you're as tenacious as ever.

2143
01:41:27,290 --> 01:41:29,330
Ai? You're here, too?

2144
01:41:29,410 --> 01:41:32,080
- What's with that tone?
If not for me,

2145
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:34,330
you'd have been burned
to a crisp at Haneda.

2146
01:41:34,410 --> 01:41:37,120
That's true. If she
hadn't agreed to my request,

2147
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:38,330
I was going to fire.

2148
01:41:38,410 --> 01:41:39,790
What request?

2149
01:41:39,870 --> 01:41:41,950
Yeah, what are
you talking about?

2150
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:44,700
- Wait a sec!
You're betraying me?

2151
01:41:44,790 --> 01:41:49,120
Betrayal can be
a woman's greatest asset, right?

2152
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:56,250
Oh, nooooo!

2153
01:46:02,790 --> 01:46:04,040
Emilio!

2154
01:46:04,120 --> 01:46:05,750
Come back real soon!

2155
01:46:07,790 --> 01:46:11,450
Thank you, Conan Edogawa.

2156
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:13,750
He's been through a lot,
hasn't he?

2157
01:46:13,830 --> 01:46:16,200
But with the support
of all these adoring fans,

2158
01:46:16,290 --> 01:46:18,450
I have a feeling
he'll be okay.

2159
01:46:18,540 --> 01:46:22,620
So what do you think Lupin
and company are up to right now?

2160
01:46:24,330 --> 01:46:25,910
Not sure.

2161
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,410
But knowing them,
they're going after

2162
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:29,870
the treasure
of some unsuspecting country.

2163
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:37,120
Your favorite thief
is in the house.

2164
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:39,000
How naive can they be?

2165
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:41,080
As if I'd come
all the way to Japan

2166
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:44,000
and not leave with
an obscenely expensive souvenir.

2167
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:45,000
Huh?

2168
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:46,910
What?!

2169
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,910
Where's the treasure? Uh...

2170
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,500
Sorry. I was first.

2171
01:46:50,580 --> 01:46:52,910
Kid, the Phantom Thief.

2172
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,160
You're under arrest, Lupin!

2173
01:46:55,250 --> 01:46:56,830
I don't believe this!

2174
01:46:56,910 --> 01:46:58,910
- Don't let him get away!
- You're not getting away!

2175
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:02,330
I didn't do it this time,
Pops! You gotta believe me!

2176
01:47:02,410 --> 01:47:04,620
Who would ever believe you?!

2177
01:47:04,700 --> 01:47:07,950
I see the game you're playing,
Kid, you no good scum-bucket!

2178
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:10,370
I'll get you for this.
Just you wait!

2179
01:47:15,700 --> 01:47:17,870
You gotta be kidding me.
