The Lord Jesus
was laid in a manger,

00:01:11.887 --> 00:01:15.421 position:24% line:83% align:start
to bring salvation
to the souls of those

00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:16.888 position:10% line:89% align:start
with no place of their own.

00:01:19.288 --> 00:01:22.355 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nothing is harder
than to have no place,

00:01:22.355 --> 00:01:24.790 position:24% line:83% align:start
but many are those
without one.

00:01:26.023 --> 00:01:28.091 position:24% line:89% align:start
Tell me about it!

00:01:28.091 --> 00:01:31.058 position:10% line:83% align:start
In their solitude, they long
for someone who will say:

00:01:31.058 --> 00:01:32.224 position:16% line:89% align:start
"I want you to be here."

00:01:32.224 --> 00:01:33.925 position:27% line:89% align:start
Not me, thanks.

00:01:33.925 --> 00:01:34.191 position:35% line:89% align:start
Be quiet!

00:01:35.792 --> 00:01:38.626 position:30% line:83% align:start
Jesus was born
to offer those alone

00:01:38.626 --> 00:01:40.426 position:7% line:89% align:start
a place in which to be alive!

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.461 position:24% line:83% align:start
"Joy to the world,
the food has come."

00:01:46.461 --> 00:01:47.895 position:7% line:89% align:start
Gin! It's "the Lord has come"!

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:52.029 position:10% line:89% align:start
You don't know much, do you?

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:54.730 position:16% line:83% align:start
I have more common sense
than some homo with no balls.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.863 position:24% line:83% align:start
God just gave me a
pair of those by mistake.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.364 position:27% line:83% align:start
But in my heart,
I am more woman than anyone.

00:02:00.364 --> 00:02:01.264 position:16% line:89% align:start
Women can have children.

00:02:03.365 --> 00:02:06.900 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh? If the Virgin Mary
got pregnant,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.533 position:16% line:83% align:start
that same miracle might
happen to someone like me!

00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:15.334 position:7% line:83% align:start
Better give me a little extra.
After all, I'm eating for two.

00:02:40.273 --> 00:02:41.307 position:24% line:89% align:start
Serves you right!

00:02:44.741 --> 00:02:45.442 position:38% line:89% align:start
Miyuki!

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:48.575 position:33% line:89% align:start
Time to eat!

00:02:52.743 --> 00:02:53.609 position:38% line:89% align:start
Miyuki!

00:02:54.944 --> 00:02:57.944 position:27% line:83% align:start
Close your legs!
Act like you were once a lady.

00:02:57.944 --> 00:02:59.611 position:33% line:89% align:start
I am a lady.

00:02:59.611 --> 00:03:01.611 position:27% line:83% align:start
And it's a waste
to spill food like that.

00:03:04.046 --> 00:03:06.914 position:7% line:89% align:start
Don't just gobble your bread.

00:03:06.914 --> 00:03:08.980 position:5% line:83% align:start
Eat it with love for the people
who made and brought it here.

00:03:11.748 --> 00:03:14.347 position:10% line:83% align:start
I hate that Bible-thumping.
You're just like Akiko.

00:03:15.247 --> 00:03:16.348 position:33% line:89% align:start
Who's Akiko?

00:03:18.682 --> 00:03:19.683 position:27% line:83% align:start
The old lady who
gave birth to me.

00:03:19.683 --> 00:03:19.850 position:41% line:89% align:start
Well!

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.650 position:10% line:89% align:start
Don't call your mother that.

00:03:22.817 --> 00:03:23.583 position:27% line:89% align:start
Eat shit, Pops.

00:03:25.718 --> 00:03:27.584 position:24% line:83% align:start
"Shit" I'll take,
but "Pops" I won't!

00:03:27.584 --> 00:03:28.852 position:19% line:89% align:start
That hurts! You old...

00:03:30.052 --> 00:03:32.186 position:35% line:89% align:start
"Granny."

00:03:32.186 --> 00:03:34.720 position:5% line:89% align:start
You peep pretty loud for a chick

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.754 position:27% line:83% align:start
that can't even
find her own worms.

00:03:37.754 --> 00:03:41.021 position:13% line:83% align:start
Should a burden on society
like you be talking?

00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:43.822 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're a burden on us.
What does that make you?

00:03:45.856 --> 00:03:47.723 position:21% line:83% align:start
The kettle the pot's
calling black!

00:03:49.957 --> 00:03:50.623 position:27% line:89% align:start
You mouthy brat!

00:03:52.924 --> 00:03:54.725 position:10% line:83% align:start
Can't you at least get along
at Christmas?

00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.892 position:33% line:83% align:start
Oh, yes....
Miyuki, I got you a present.

00:04:02.893 --> 00:04:04.893 position:30% line:89% align:start
They're gone!

00:04:04.893 --> 00:04:06.560 position:30% line:83% align:start
A whole set of
"World Literature for Children."

00:04:07.994 --> 00:04:10.527 position:16% line:89% align:start
Why would I need that?!

00:04:10.527 --> 00:04:13.062 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hana looked hard for those!

00:04:13.062 --> 00:04:15.763 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even a homeless teenage runaway
needs a Christmas present!

00:04:17.963 --> 00:04:20.630 position:16% line:89% align:start
I choose not to go home.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.931 position:16% line:83% align:start
Six months on the street
means you're homeless.

00:04:23.931 --> 00:04:24.765 position:30% line:83% align:start
I can go home
any time I want to.

00:04:26.998 --> 00:04:30.499 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's the ones who say that
who never do.

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:31.432 position:10% line:89% align:start
Speak for yourself, old man!

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.867 position:24% line:83% align:start
What are you doing
to Dostoevsky?!

00:04:36.967 --> 00:04:39.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
I won't take that,
today of all days!

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.902 position:24% line:83% align:start
Not even my father
ever hit me!

00:04:46.037 --> 00:04:47.803 position:19% line:89% align:start
So I'll do it for him!

00:04:52.304 --> 00:04:54.237 position:21% line:89% align:start
Grow up, will you?!

00:04:56.172 --> 00:04:56.705 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't hurt yourselves.

00:04:58.139 --> 00:04:58.772 position:16% line:89% align:start
Show more respect, kid!

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.673 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm not a kid!

00:05:01.673 --> 00:05:04.707 position:10% line:89% align:start
With little tits like these?

00:05:04.707 --> 00:05:05.407 position:16% line:83% align:start
You filthy old pervert!
That's harassment!

00:05:06.507 --> 00:05:07.875 position:24% line:89% align:start
Will you two stop!

00:05:11.274 --> 00:05:11.876 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:32.047 --> 00:05:33.447 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's been...

00:05:33.447 --> 00:05:34.447 position:35% line:89% align:start
abandoned.

00:05:35.614 --> 00:05:37.247 position:21% line:89% align:start
There, there, there.

00:05:40.615 --> 00:05:42.483 position:21% line:89% align:start
CARE FOR THIS CHILD.

00:05:45.117 --> 00:05:45.916 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, man!

00:05:47.017 --> 00:05:49.350 position:30% line:89% align:start
What a world!

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.185 position:7% line:83% align:start
Oh, my! You're a little girl.
I wonder what your name is.

00:05:53.185 --> 00:05:55.619 position:33% line:89% align:start
"John Doe."

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:56.385 position:19% line:83% align:start
She's a girl, I said!
He's so rude!

00:05:58.786 --> 00:06:01.987 position:10% line:83% align:start
How old was I when I started
living like this?

00:06:01.987 --> 00:06:02.954 position:24% line:89% align:start
Thirty-something?

00:06:05.921 --> 00:06:08.922 position:27% line:83% align:start
I still thought
that I was better off,

00:06:10.489 --> 00:06:11.722 position:13% line:89% align:start
than a child with no home.

00:06:20.725 --> 00:06:23.759 position:24% line:83% align:start
There, there, now!
We'll take you somewhere warm.

00:06:26.626 --> 00:06:28.659 position:16% line:89% align:start
The cop shop's that way!

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.494 position:10% line:83% align:start

00:06:33.494 --> 00:06:35.661 position:27% line:89% align:start
She's our baby!

00:06:36.294 --> 00:06:36.928 position:44% line:89% align:start

Sorry!

What do you mean,
take her with us?

00:07:33.407 --> 00:07:34.675 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm just doing God's will.

00:07:36.308 --> 00:07:36.375 position:10% line:89% align:start
Her parents might come back.

00:07:38.877 --> 00:07:42.077 position:16% line:83% align:start
What parent would leave
a child out in this cold?!

00:07:42.077 --> 00:07:43.911 position:7% line:89% align:start
That's a devil, not a parent!

00:07:47.645 --> 00:07:50.845 position:27% line:83% align:start
Kiyoko wanted us
to find her.

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:52.379 position:35% line:89% align:start
"Kiyoko"?

00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:53.446 position:16% line:89% align:start
"Kiyoko"? Why "Kiyoko"?!

00:07:55.881 --> 00:07:58.614 position:21% line:83% align:start
From kiyo , "pure,"
on this purest of nights.

00:07:59.514 --> 00:08:00.982 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's lame.

00:08:00.982 --> 00:08:01.448 position:19% line:89% align:start
Kiyoko's a fine name!

00:08:03.948 --> 00:08:05.382 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why so sensitive?
Old girlfriend with that name?

00:08:05.382 --> 00:08:06.349 position:41% line:89% align:start
Idiot!

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:12.450 position:7% line:83% align:start
Look, we can't just name her!
She's not a puppy or a kitten!

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.085 position:16% line:89% align:start
So I'm taking her home.

00:08:14.085 --> 00:08:15.417 position:21% line:89% align:start
To a cardboard box?

00:08:15.417 --> 00:08:15.818 position:27% line:89% align:start
There's no room!

00:08:17.886 --> 00:08:20.153 position:35% line:83% align:start

Hey!

I know, I know,
he's not your mommy.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:05.897 position:13% line:89% align:start

Don't say messed up stuff

We're going to take you

00:09:23.734 --> 00:09:26.001 position:33% line:83% align:start
Don't shout
or she'll never shut up!

00:09:26.001 --> 00:09:29.035 position:13% line:83% align:start
Why won't you stop crying?
Are you hungry?

00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:29.035 position:30% line:89% align:start
There, there!

00:09:30.301 --> 00:09:32.036 position:24% line:89% align:start
Maybe she's sick.

00:09:46.939 --> 00:09:49.406 position:33% line:83% align:start
Tomorrow....
I promise I'll take her then.

00:09:51.973 --> 00:09:56.041 position:21% line:83% align:start
Christmas should be
the happiest day of the year.

00:09:56.041 --> 00:09:58.109 position:19% line:89% align:start
If we take her in now,

00:09:58.109 --> 00:09:58.809 position:27% line:83% align:start
it'll always be
the worst day of her life!

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:01.509 position:41% line:89% align:start
Maybe,

00:10:02.943 --> 00:10:04.076 position:21% line:89% align:start
she needs a diaper.

00:10:14.712 --> 00:10:15.546 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hana, boil some water.

00:10:16.679 --> 00:10:16.979 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'll make some milk.

00:10:18.613 --> 00:10:21.747 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hey! Whose side are you on?!

00:10:21.747 --> 00:10:24.681 position:10% line:83% align:start
Go buy some water! My angel
isn't drinking from the tap!

00:10:25.381 --> 00:10:26.849 position:38% line:89% align:start
Why me?

00:10:29.249 --> 00:10:31.550 position:16% line:83% align:start
Where does a bum get off
telling me

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:32.850 position:16% line:89% align:start
"them that works, eats"?

00:10:35.484 --> 00:10:37.417 position:10% line:89% align:start
Just for tonight, remember.

00:10:37.417 --> 00:10:39.518 position:21% line:83% align:start
Tomorrow we take her
to the police.

00:10:42.819 --> 00:10:45.920 position:16% line:83% align:start
So "no man is an island"
after all, huh?

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.087 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're buying water?!

00:10:53.655 --> 00:10:54.922 position:21% line:89% align:start
A Christmas miracle.

00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:57.789 position:33% line:89% align:start
What a haul!

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:07.391 position:5% line:89% align:start
Watch where you're going, brat!

00:11:07.391 --> 00:11:08.524 position:7% line:89% align:start
You watch where you're going!

00:11:12.592 --> 00:11:14.459 position:21% line:89% align:start
I was married once.

00:11:15.426 --> 00:11:17.693 position:30% line:89% align:start
With a child?

00:11:17.693 --> 00:11:20.527 position:24% line:83% align:start
No, don't tell me!
I don't want to hear this!

00:11:22.862 --> 00:11:26.896 position:27% line:83% align:start
You never forget
for one second.

00:11:26.896 --> 00:11:29.963 position:10% line:83% align:start
A child's the only thing you
hold dearer than life itself.

00:11:31.864 --> 00:11:32.831 position:41% line:89% align:start
A boy?

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:34.497 position:44% line:89% align:start
No.

00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:41.166 position:35% line:89% align:start
Bullshit!

00:11:41.166 --> 00:11:41.632 position:19% line:89% align:start
Come on! Give it back!

00:11:43.933 --> 00:11:48.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey, you're the girl
who hangs out with Gin.

00:11:48.067 --> 00:11:49.768 position:13% line:89% align:start
Get out of here, will you?

00:11:49.768 --> 00:11:51.568 position:10% line:89% align:start
We don't want Gin after us.

00:11:52.902 --> 00:11:54.769 position:38% line:89% align:start
Why not?

00:11:54.769 --> 00:11:56.002 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're his spoiled princess,
that's why!

00:11:58.937 --> 00:12:02.470 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well this princess should
get back to her cardboard box.

00:12:03.704 --> 00:12:05.370 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let me have this book.

00:12:08.272 --> 00:12:10.739 position:38% line:89% align:start
How old?

00:12:10.739 --> 00:12:11.372 position:7% line:89% align:start
Twenty-one this year, I think.

00:12:13.739 --> 00:12:17.473 position:16% line:83% align:start
Five or six years older
than Miyuki, I guess.

00:12:17.473 --> 00:12:19.608 position:35% line:89% align:start
That old?

00:12:19.608 --> 00:12:21.474 position:24% line:89% align:start
If she was alive.

00:12:24.009 --> 00:12:26.210 position:30% line:83% align:start
When I was 20
I got a girl pregnant,

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:27.610 position:21% line:89% align:start
and we got married.

00:12:28.543 --> 00:12:29.476 position:27% line:89% align:start
I was in heaven.

00:12:31.511 --> 00:12:33.312 position:30% line:83% align:start
You could have
poked me in the eye

00:12:33.312 --> 00:12:35.846 position:5% line:89% align:start
and I'd have just smiled at you.

00:12:35.846 --> 00:12:41.680 position:13% line:83% align:start
But my daughter got sick,
and the medical bills were huge.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.681 position:24% line:83% align:start
I was something of
a bicycle racer then.

00:12:46.848 --> 00:12:50.149 position:27% line:83% align:start
I needed money.
There was this race....

00:12:50.149 --> 00:12:50.982 position:30% line:89% align:start
You threw it?

00:12:54.317 --> 00:12:58.851 position:30% line:83% align:start
A punk I knew
had this scheme.

00:12:58.851 --> 00:13:02.418 position:5% line:83% align:start
They found out, I got kicked out
of racing, and my girl died.

00:13:04.685 --> 00:13:05.852 position:24% line:83% align:start
I just didn't feel
like working anymore.

00:13:07.919 --> 00:13:10.720 position:27% line:83% align:start
And then my wife
followed my daughter.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.420 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, no!

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:14.120 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's how you get to be
a man like me.

00:13:16.721 --> 00:13:18.956 position:10% line:83% align:start
I didn't want to hear that!
I hate sad stories!

00:13:20.622 --> 00:13:22.388 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's freezing!

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:27.791 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're used to this.

00:13:27.791 --> 00:13:29.291 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kind of.

00:13:29.291 --> 00:13:31.490 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll give her the milk.

00:13:33.092 --> 00:13:35.825 position:21% line:89% align:start
Dreams do come true.

00:13:35.825 --> 00:13:40.459 position:13% line:83% align:start
I always dreamed of being
the mother of a little girl.

00:13:40.459 --> 00:13:42.627 position:21% line:83% align:start
A nice, warm house,
a pretty daughter.

00:13:42.627 --> 00:13:45.928 position:24% line:83% align:start
Even if my husband
was no good,

00:13:45.928 --> 00:13:48.295 position:10% line:83% align:start
I would accept dire poverty
as long as I had my child.

00:13:48.295 --> 00:13:49.762 position:24% line:89% align:start
Feed the poor kid!

00:13:55.297 --> 00:13:56.396 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're so pretty.

00:13:58.598 --> 00:14:01.397 position:13% line:83% align:start
The prettiest little girl
in the world.

00:14:27.171 --> 00:14:27.737 position:24% line:89% align:start
What do you want?!

00:14:28.938 --> 00:14:29.605 position:30% line:89% align:start
They're gone.

00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:34.106 position:21% line:89% align:start
Santa Claus, maybe?

00:14:36.439 --> 00:14:39.506 position:10% line:83% align:start
Geezer Grandma and the baby
are gone.

00:14:39.506 --> 00:14:41.441 position:38% line:83% align:start
Dammit,
what is that bastard up to?!

00:14:44.741 --> 00:14:47.408 position:16% line:89% align:start
Those are some big feet!

00:14:47.408 --> 00:14:49.109 position:13% line:89% align:start
You can't have feet fixed.

00:15:06.747 --> 00:15:08.081 position:16% line:89% align:start
Are you taking her back?

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.748 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's probably an APB
out on her.

00:15:12.615 --> 00:15:14.381 position:33% line:89% align:start
And for you.

00:15:14.381 --> 00:15:14.715 position:33% line:89% align:start
I doubt it.

00:15:16.415 --> 00:15:19.083 position:13% line:89% align:start
An arrest warrant, maybe.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:23.117 position:16% line:83% align:start
Her parents are probably
regretting this

00:15:23.117 --> 00:15:24.484 position:19% line:89% align:start
after sleeping on it.

00:15:24.484 --> 00:15:25.484 position:5% line:89% align:start
So let's take her to the police.

00:15:27.951 --> 00:15:31.852 position:5% line:83% align:start
A baby's always better off with
its real parents.

00:15:31.852 --> 00:15:33.087 position:27% line:89% align:start
Not necessarily.

00:15:35.753 --> 00:15:38.487 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sometimes foster parents
are better.

00:15:38.487 --> 00:15:39.854 position:38% line:83% align:start
-What?!
-Don't be stupid.

00:15:41.622 --> 00:15:44.122 position:33% line:83% align:start
I never knew
my real mother.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:50.724 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I'll bet if she saw me now,
she'd flip.

00:15:53.024 --> 00:15:54.625 position:16% line:83% align:start
You can't raise a child,
you're homeless!

00:15:55.591 --> 00:15:57.092 position:27% line:89% align:start
I know, I know!

00:15:59.859 --> 00:16:01.726 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't want her shunted
from one foster home to another,

00:16:03.426 --> 00:16:05.593 position:7% line:89% align:start
without even a single memory,

00:16:05.593 --> 00:16:06.393 position:13% line:89% align:start
of ever having been loved.

00:16:08.728 --> 00:16:10.661 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't have to be a foundling
to feel that.

00:16:12.296 --> 00:16:14.729 position:10% line:89% align:start
They must have had reasons.

00:16:14.729 --> 00:16:16.663 position:16% line:83% align:start
Nothing should make you
abandon a child!

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:23.430 position:10% line:83% align:start
That means you've taken love
and tossed it away, like trash.

00:16:25.665 --> 00:16:27.698 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but what can we
do about it?

00:16:28.933 --> 00:16:29.766 position:27% line:89% align:start
Find her mother.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.901 position:13% line:83% align:start
And ask why she abandoned
her baby.

00:16:37.234 --> 00:16:38.668 position:5% line:89% align:start
If she can make me understand...

00:16:40.735 --> 00:16:42.469 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll forgive her,
and my mother too.

00:16:43.602 --> 00:16:45.937 position:35% line:89% align:start
Find her?

00:16:45.937 --> 00:16:47.137 position:44% line:89% align:start
How?

00:16:51.771 --> 00:16:52.171 position:16% line:89% align:start
We'll have to pay again.

00:16:54.972 --> 00:16:56.438 position:13% line:83% align:start
This year is determined to
take our every last cent.

00:16:57.972 --> 00:17:00.506 position:7% line:89% align:start
What if we find another baby?

00:17:00.506 --> 00:17:01.940 position:35% line:83% align:start
They don't
toss them out in twos.

00:17:13.643 --> 00:17:13.943 position:33% line:89% align:start
Another key!

00:17:16.378 --> 00:17:19.111 position:19% line:83% align:start
Look at these panties.
You'd catch cold in them!

00:17:20.411 --> 00:17:22.544 position:24% line:89% align:start
Are they the ones?

00:17:26.479 --> 00:17:27.779 position:19% line:89% align:start
Are these your folks?

00:17:29.214 --> 00:17:30.480 position:19% line:89% align:start
Look, business cards.

00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:40.682 position:30% line:83% align:start
A hostess club
won't be open at this hour!

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:43.650 position:35% line:83% align:start
Looks like
we're going on a trip.

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:46.584 position:16% line:89% align:start
You've gotta be kidding!

00:17:50.385 --> 00:17:51.785 position:21% line:89% align:start
There was a miracle!

00:18:06.222 --> 00:18:09.789 position:5% line:83% align:start
But why pack like you're off on
a trip and then abandon a baby?

00:18:12.124 --> 00:18:15.224 position:13% line:83% align:start
Maybe it was one last trip
they were taking.

00:18:15.224 --> 00:18:15.757 position:24% line:89% align:start
A family suicide?!

00:18:18.125 --> 00:18:18.191 position:21% line:89% align:start
Then what do we do?

00:18:19.791 --> 00:18:21.926 position:5% line:89% align:start
We can't search the next world!

00:18:21.926 --> 00:18:22.926 position:44% line:89% align:start
Shh!

00:18:29.928 --> 00:18:30.994 position:27% line:83% align:start
We apologize for
any inconvenience.

00:18:33.627 --> 00:18:36.895 position:13% line:83% align:start
Trains will be delayed due
to heavy snowfall.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:38.863 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's so hot in here!

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:40.896 position:30% line:89% align:start
What a stink!

00:18:42.331 --> 00:18:44.664 position:16% line:89% align:start
Have you bathed lately?

00:18:46.197 --> 00:18:46.831 position:13% line:89% align:start
No. Or washed my clothes.

00:18:48.098 --> 00:18:48.998 position:24% line:89% align:start
How embarrassing!

00:18:59.567 --> 00:19:02.201 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, dear! There, there.

00:19:02.201 --> 00:19:05.369 position:19% line:83% align:start
Did she piss herself?
That's why it stinks!

00:19:05.369 --> 00:19:06.202 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's you that stinks!

00:19:07.102 --> 00:19:08.436 position:41% line:89% align:start
Quiet!

00:19:08.436 --> 00:19:09.770 position:24% line:89% align:start
Shut that kid up!

00:19:24.973 --> 00:19:25.740 position:35% line:89% align:start
Watch it!

00:19:26.974 --> 00:19:27.074 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:19:37.043 --> 00:19:38.543 position:38% line:89% align:start
Miyuki!

00:19:38.543 --> 00:19:39.743 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's she up to?

00:19:46.778 --> 00:19:48.512 position:13% line:89% align:start
We wasted our train fares!

00:19:49.712 --> 00:19:51.680 position:16% line:89% align:start
It was me who paid them.

00:19:53.947 --> 00:19:57.681 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry!
There's no more milk.

00:19:57.681 --> 00:19:58.580 position:7% line:89% align:start
Go ahead, blame it all on me.

00:20:00.548 --> 00:20:02.748 position:30% line:83% align:start
Oh, cheer up!
Let's sing a song.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.684 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's that?

00:20:09.684 --> 00:20:09.884 position:21% line:83% align:start
The Sound of Music ,
of course.

00:20:11.184 --> 00:20:11.650 position:24% line:89% align:start
Never heard of it.

00:20:20.786 --> 00:20:23.020 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's going to make you
even hungrier.

00:20:32.588 --> 00:20:33.956 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm starving!

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.090 position:33% line:89% align:start
I told you!

00:20:37.723 --> 00:20:39.724 position:10% line:89% align:start
Look after my little angel.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:41.691 position:24% line:89% align:start
Go on without me.

00:20:44.059 --> 00:20:46.892 position:10% line:83% align:start
Just say you'll never forget
the queen you once knew.

00:20:48.393 --> 00:20:50.592 position:41% line:83% align:start
Look.
A cemetery.

00:20:50.592 --> 00:20:51.961 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm not dead yet!

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.130 position:21% line:89% align:start
Now I'm alive again!

00:21:10.231 --> 00:21:14.399 position:7% line:83% align:start
But there's nothing for a baby
in these offerings to the dead!

00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:15.498 position:30% line:89% align:start
We'll get by!

00:21:16.932 --> 00:21:20.400 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah, sure! "We'll get by!"

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.801 position:13% line:83% align:start
People keep on saying that
till they end up living like us!

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.202 position:5% line:89% align:start
And while we keep on saying it,

00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:27.835 position:16% line:83% align:start
the kid'll end up under
a stone here.

00:21:29.369 --> 00:21:31.270 position:13% line:89% align:start
"Kiyoko"! She has a name!

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:34.837 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, whatever. And she's cute.
She's so pretty.

00:21:36.537 --> 00:21:38.104 position:7% line:89% align:start
But listen to me. I'm serious.

00:21:39.339 --> 00:21:39.972 position:30% line:89% align:start
You listening?

00:21:42.005 --> 00:21:45.973 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you really care
about that kid,

00:21:45.973 --> 00:21:48.640 position:16% line:83% align:start
you'll find her someone
to take care of her.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.773 position:16% line:89% align:start
I speak from experience.

00:21:51.773 --> 00:21:54.175 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's what her parents said,
I bet.

00:21:54.175 --> 00:21:57.409 position:24% line:83% align:start
What do you mean?
I wouldn't abandon a kid.

00:21:57.409 --> 00:22:00.076 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't be stupid!

00:22:00.076 --> 00:22:01.609 position:27% line:83% align:start
No. Your family
abandoned you!

00:22:04.177 --> 00:22:05.744 position:21% line:83% align:start
There you go again!
Am I going to sit and listen,

00:22:07.544 --> 00:22:08.744 position:27% line:83% align:start
while some pansy
pisses on me?

00:22:10.545 --> 00:22:14.447 position:16% line:83% align:start
What are we doing here?
Tell me.

00:22:14.447 --> 00:22:17.013 position:21% line:89% align:start
Wracking our brains!

00:22:17.013 --> 00:22:19.981 position:13% line:83% align:start
We're scavenging offerings
left in a cemetery.

00:22:19.981 --> 00:22:21.081 position:27% line:83% align:start
And why? Because
we're homeless.

00:22:23.315 --> 00:22:26.449 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Stop it!
-No! 'm not going to stop.

00:22:26.449 --> 00:22:27.615 position:33% line:83% align:start
We are three
good-for-nothing bums,

00:22:29.716 --> 00:22:30.249 position:30% line:83% align:start
who can't even
look after ourselves.

00:22:31.883 --> 00:22:33.117 position:19% line:89% align:start
Shut up! 'm thinking!

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:34.683 position:27% line:89% align:start
I won't shut up.

00:22:36.784 --> 00:22:38.818 position:24% line:83% align:start
You can't get milk
out of your tits,

00:22:38.818 --> 00:22:39.919 position:5% line:89% align:start
no matter how hard you squeeze.

00:22:42.119 --> 00:22:45.020 position:16% line:83% align:start
Come on, Hana! You know
we can't do this.

00:22:46.387 --> 00:22:46.253 position:21% line:89% align:start
Speak for yourself!

00:22:48.954 --> 00:22:50.754 position:7% line:83% align:start
At this rate, the whole family
will be dead soon.

00:22:59.823 --> 00:23:01.191 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, my!

00:23:03.091 --> 00:23:05.791 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're so lucky, Kiyoko!

00:23:05.791 --> 00:23:07.192 position:13% line:89% align:start
God must really love you!

00:23:08.791 --> 00:23:10.293 position:21% line:89% align:start
Then why was she...

00:23:10.293 --> 00:23:11.193 position:38% line:89% align:start
dumped?

00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:14.927 position:41% line:89% align:start
Left!

00:23:14.927 --> 00:23:18.027 position:21% line:83% align:start
-That's a dead end!
-It's right!

00:23:21.462 --> 00:23:22.895 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Tails.
-Heads.

00:23:32.964 --> 00:23:36.232 position:19% line:83% align:start
What's this guy doing
parking like that?

00:23:36.232 --> 00:23:38.132 position:21% line:83% align:start
Doesn't he know what
a "public thoroughfare" is?

00:23:59.503 --> 00:24:01.904 position:21% line:89% align:start
How did that happen?

00:24:01.904 --> 00:24:07.605 position:10% line:83% align:start
Bad luck. The car got stuck,
and I forgot the parking brake.

00:24:07.605 --> 00:24:09.805 position:19% line:83% align:start
Then someone shouted,
"Dorothy, wait!"

00:24:09.805 --> 00:24:10.107 position:10% line:89% align:start
and then I heard, "Whoops!"

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.008 position:27% line:83% align:start
and the damn car
rolled on top of me.

00:24:16.907 --> 00:24:19.908 position:10% line:89% align:start
I don't bring my men with me

00:24:19.908 --> 00:24:21.608 position:24% line:83% align:start
when I'm visiting
the old man's grave.

00:24:23.976 --> 00:24:25.709 position:24% line:83% align:start
I owe you. Call me
if you're ever in trouble.

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:29.710 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, no, we never have
any trouble. Bye.

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:31.978 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're from Kinshicho?

00:24:31.978 --> 00:24:34.878 position:13% line:89% align:start
We were just going there.

00:24:34.878 --> 00:24:37.413 position:10% line:89% align:start
I know it's rude to ask....

00:24:37.413 --> 00:24:39.279 position:7% line:89% align:start
If it's rude, then don't ask.

00:24:39.279 --> 00:24:40.247 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on.

00:24:42.847 --> 00:24:44.114 position:30% line:83% align:start
Would you know
this establishment?

00:24:45.482 --> 00:24:46.115 position:21% line:89% align:start
CLUB SWIRL: "MIDORI"

00:24:47.547 --> 00:24:48.215 position:38% line:89% align:start
Know it?

00:24:51.216 --> 00:24:54.017 position:5% line:83% align:start
As a matter of fact, the owner's
marrying my daughter today.

00:24:56.283 --> 00:25:00.784 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's one of my men,
but he's too cocky.

00:25:00.784 --> 00:25:01.985 position:24% line:89% align:start
I was against it.

00:25:03.618 --> 00:25:03.785 position:10% line:89% align:start
But your daughter chose him.

00:25:06.552 --> 00:25:08.986 position:13% line:83% align:start
The daughter I brought up,
married to a man like that....

00:25:11.154 --> 00:25:11.254 position:24% line:89% align:start
Know what I mean?

00:25:13.553 --> 00:25:17.921 position:19% line:83% align:start
But if your daughter's
happy with him,

00:25:17.921 --> 00:25:19.589 position:24% line:83% align:start
isn't that what's
most important?

00:25:19.589 --> 00:25:20.956 position:30% line:89% align:start
You're right!

00:25:20.956 --> 00:25:24.224 position:10% line:89% align:start
I went to my old man's grave

00:25:24.224 --> 00:25:26.923 position:33% line:83% align:start
to vow that
I wouldn't cry at the wedding.

00:25:28.091 --> 00:25:29.258 position:27% line:89% align:start
Watch the road!

00:25:35.592 --> 00:25:36.559 position:24% line:89% align:start
Good evening, sir!

00:25:39.227 --> 00:25:40.560 position:16% line:89% align:start
Make yourselves at home.

00:25:54.164 --> 00:25:56.264 position:21% line:89% align:start
Daddy, you're late!

00:25:56.264 --> 00:26:00.132 position:30% line:83% align:start
Sorry, sorry.
I almost got killed.

00:26:00.132 --> 00:26:03.199 position:21% line:89% align:start
I owe them my life.

00:26:03.199 --> 00:26:04.632 position:21% line:89% align:start
My daughter, Kiyoko.

00:26:04.632 --> 00:26:05.599 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh. Hello.

00:26:16.835 --> 00:26:19.736 position:7% line:89% align:start
What have you gotten us into?!

00:26:19.736 --> 00:26:21.303 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just shut up and eat!

00:26:26.004 --> 00:26:27.737 position:30% line:83% align:start
Diaper change.
Your turn, Miyuki.

00:26:37.207 --> 00:26:40.540 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't you think Kiyoko
has amazing luck?

00:26:43.375 --> 00:26:44.008 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:26:45.176 --> 00:26:46.709 position:27% line:89% align:start
Maybe she does.

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:52.877 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah. Her name's Sachiko.

00:26:53.811 --> 00:26:54.278 position:30% line:89% align:start
Not "Midori"?

00:26:55.544 --> 00:26:57.911 position:24% line:89% align:start
Just at the club.

00:26:57.911 --> 00:27:00.979 position:7% line:83% align:start
She's Sachiko, "happy child,"
though she didn't look it.

00:27:00.979 --> 00:27:04.613 position:5% line:83% align:start
But some plastic surgery turned
her into a good little earner.

00:27:07.081 --> 00:27:09.814 position:35% line:83% align:start
She quit.
Said she was pregnant.

00:27:09.814 --> 00:27:10.814 position:13% line:89% align:start
Do you know where she is?

00:27:13.115 --> 00:27:14.149 position:21% line:83% align:start
I doubt you'll wring
any money out of her.

00:27:16.116 --> 00:27:18.016 position:21% line:83% align:start
No, I have something
to give her.

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:24.285 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry
I spilled your food.

00:27:26.785 --> 00:27:29.019 position:24% line:83% align:start
You remember her?
Midori, the skinny broad.

00:27:31.752 --> 00:27:33.787 position:21% line:83% align:start
She said her husband
was in debt.

00:27:33.787 --> 00:27:35.787 position:19% line:89% align:start
What's wrong with you?

00:27:35.787 --> 00:27:37.255 position:30% line:89% align:start
That bastard.

00:27:37.255 --> 00:27:38.255 position:27% line:89% align:start
Do you know him?

00:27:40.355 --> 00:27:40.621 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then she borrowed
more money from us,

00:27:42.989 --> 00:27:44.256 position:10% line:83% align:start
and ended up getting screwed
in more ways than one.

00:27:45.689 --> 00:27:46.257 position:19% line:89% align:start
You know where she is?

00:27:49.023 --> 00:27:52.525 position:19% line:83% align:start
If it weren't for his
damn get-rich-quick scheme,

00:27:52.525 --> 00:27:55.292 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'd still be with
my wife and kid!

00:27:55.292 --> 00:27:57.792 position:13% line:89% align:start
But aren't they both dead?

00:27:57.792 --> 00:27:59.293 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'll kill the bastard!

00:28:00.859 --> 00:28:02.592 position:24% line:89% align:start
You'll get killed!

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.434 position:27% line:89% align:start
Mitsuo! Mitsuo!

00:28:31.434 --> 00:28:33.834 position:24% line:89% align:start
It was that maid!

00:28:33.834 --> 00:28:35.234 position:30% line:89% align:start
Are you okay?!

00:28:36.801 --> 00:28:37.735 position:27% line:89% align:start
She's got a gun!

00:28:39.835 --> 00:28:40.335 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, what--?!

00:28:45.803 --> 00:28:47.204 position:27% line:89% align:start
Kiyoko! Miyuki!

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:49.304 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:28:55.306 --> 00:28:56.939 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Spanish]

00:29:11.876 --> 00:29:14.010 position:21% line:89% align:start
Thank you very much.

00:29:15.576 --> 00:29:18.511 position:13% line:89% align:start
She's got a gun, you know!

00:29:18.511 --> 00:29:20.878 position:10% line:83% align:start
- What have we got to lose?
- Hana!

00:29:27.046 --> 00:29:27.280 position:41% line:89% align:start
There!

00:29:54.186 --> 00:29:57.920 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes! One of your cabs picked up
a young woman with a baby.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.288 position:16% line:89% align:start
Number 12-25. Send it to

00:30:02.421 --> 00:30:04.322 position:27% line:83% align:start
the Tokyo Tower.
My name is--

00:30:07.422 --> 00:30:09.622 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey! Wait a minute.

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:17.991 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're homeless bums,
not action-movie heroes.

00:30:19.791 --> 00:30:20.358 position:27% line:83% align:start
What we need now
is the police.

00:30:23.193 --> 00:30:26.227 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you like the police so much,
get them to adopt you!

I thought I could
depend on you!

00:30:33.295 --> 00:30:35.728 position:16% line:83% align:start
Don't talk like you were
my damn wife.

00:30:38.564 --> 00:30:40.130 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm not going anywhere.

Gin!

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:44.331 position:16% line:89% align:start
We've done all we could.

You're giving up?

00:30:46.565 --> 00:30:48.132 position:13% line:89% align:start
There's nothing we can do.

You are really
the lowest of the low!

The best thing you'll ever do
is die in the gutter!

Oh, poor you! You'll be dead
and no one'll care!

cause people trouble!

Dead or alive,
you're human trash!

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:07.802 position:24% line:89% align:start
The king of trash!

00:31:13.038 --> 00:31:16.271 position:19% line:83% align:start
Trash? What does that
old witch know anyway?

00:31:32.275 --> 00:31:32.209 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes?

00:31:33.875 --> 00:31:35.809 position:5% line:89% align:start
I want to get rid of some trash.

00:31:41.677 --> 00:31:43.278 position:19% line:89% align:start
I don't think I'd fit.

00:31:45.312 --> 00:31:49.313 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah, that's what I am,
human trash!

00:31:51.847 --> 00:31:55.047 position:21% line:83% align:start
Who cares if you die
in the gutter?

00:31:57.081 --> 00:31:59.949 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're dead all the same.

You okay?

00:32:25.554 --> 00:32:27.122 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hang in there, Gramps.

-May I make one last request?
-What?

00:32:35.491 --> 00:32:36.990 position:16% line:89% align:start
Give me a drink of that.

Somebody, help!

00:33:50.107 --> 00:33:53.674 position:7% line:83% align:start
I always wanted to die drunk,
in a nice old house.

00:33:53.674 --> 00:33:56.942 position:19% line:89% align:start
Now I'm halfway there.

I've lived a long time,

00:34:03.611 --> 00:34:05.411 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I'm just trash,
as worthless dead as alive.

00:34:06.844 --> 00:34:07.944 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't talk like that!

00:34:10.246 --> 00:34:13.246 position:16% line:83% align:start
You remind me of myself
when I was younger.

00:34:14.614 --> 00:34:16.013 position:21% line:89% align:start
Looking at you now,

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:19.981 position:13% line:89% align:start
may I make a last request?

00:34:21.414 --> 00:34:22.648 position:16% line:89% align:start
Get rid of this for me.

00:34:24.982 --> 00:34:30.917 position:16% line:83% align:start
Some people will be hurt
if it's known who I am.

00:34:30.917 --> 00:34:33.217 position:21% line:83% align:start
Okay. I understand.
No one will ever know.

00:34:48.421 --> 00:34:51.721 position:10% line:83% align:start
Take care of yourself, okay?
May I make a last...?

00:34:52.556 --> 00:34:53.722 position:38% line:89% align:start
Request?

00:34:59.723 --> 00:35:01.991 position:24% line:89% align:start
And now, goodbye.

Your dad's a cop?!

My father was a policeman!

Father, policeman?

00:36:24.443 --> 00:36:28.977 position:24% line:83% align:start
Except I'm the one
he's going to be arresting.

00:36:44.147 --> 00:36:44.948 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hold it.

00:36:48.749 --> 00:36:50.349 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hi! How've you been?

00:36:53.716 --> 00:36:54.683 position:19% line:89% align:start
Now? Just cleaning up.

00:36:55.651 --> 00:36:57.717 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, wake up!

All cleaned up.

00:37:23.391 --> 00:37:24.057 position:30% line:89% align:start
Give it back!

Give me that back!

Her foreigner husband looked

00:37:34.792 --> 00:37:37.160 position:27% line:89% align:start
Did he hit her?

No, she was being real nice

My wife could learn something!

police speculate this
may be a war

00:37:55.764 --> 00:37:58.865 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey, this is serious!

00:37:58.865 --> 00:38:00.132 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm not kidding around, either!

My mom's religious.

All she does is...

00:38:17.403 --> 00:38:18.069 position:44% line:89% align:start
Me.

00:38:22.903 --> 00:38:23.103 position:27% line:89% align:start
Isn't she cute?

00:38:25.638 --> 00:38:28.705 position:16% line:83% align:start
I found her. Those spots
on her back look like wings.

00:38:28.705 --> 00:38:29.705 position:16% line:89% align:start
So I called her "Angel."

00:38:31.805 --> 00:38:33.440 position:27% line:89% align:start
But she's gone.

00:38:36.807 --> 00:38:38.041 position:38% line:89% align:start
Father.

00:38:49.043 --> 00:38:50.277 position:21% line:89% align:start
I stabbed my father.

00:38:51.644 --> 00:38:53.211 position:21% line:89% align:start
I can never go back.

00:39:20.184 --> 00:39:23.084 position:13% line:89% align:start
The baby? A gift from God.

00:39:23.084 --> 00:39:23.418 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:39:24.952 --> 00:39:26.452 position:27% line:89% align:start
Give me a break!

00:39:28.018 --> 00:39:30.119 position:13% line:89% align:start
I've got a family at home!

00:39:30.119 --> 00:39:31.786 position:7% line:89% align:start
Those children are my family!

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.054 position:21% line:89% align:start
They went in there.

00:39:35.987 --> 00:39:37.355 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey! The fare!

00:39:37.355 --> 00:39:37.821 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'll be right back.

How could you do this to me?!

00:40:17.064 --> 00:40:17.964 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's your own fault!

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:22.831 position:27% line:83% align:start
You never listen
to anything I say!

00:40:22.831 --> 00:40:24.899 position:13% line:89% align:start
Use the scarf I made you,

00:40:24.899 --> 00:40:27.166 position:21% line:89% align:start
to mop up the blood!

00:40:27.166 --> 00:40:27.233 position:24% line:83% align:start
What have you done
with Angel?!

00:40:28.766 --> 00:40:30.434 position:30% line:83% align:start
Where is she?
Where is my Angel?

00:40:31.766 --> 00:40:32.400 position:24% line:89% align:start
She's right here.

00:40:33.435 --> 00:40:34.268 position:35% line:89% align:start
Our angel.

00:40:36.934 --> 00:40:37.935 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm hungry.

00:40:39.035 --> 00:40:40.135 position:24% line:89% align:start
Make me some food.

00:40:41.637 --> 00:40:41.803 position:44% line:89% align:start
Why?

00:40:43.503 --> 00:40:46.171 position:5% line:89% align:start
What are you doing in my house?

00:40:46.171 --> 00:40:49.338 position:21% line:83% align:start
Miyuki, take Kiyoko.
I'll get dinner.

00:41:00.241 --> 00:41:04.442 position:27% line:89% align:start
Kiyoko! Miyuki!

00:41:09.909 --> 00:41:10.842 position:27% line:89% align:start
Geezer Grandma?!

00:41:15.711 --> 00:41:18.311 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, I've missed you,
my little angel!

[Spanish]

00:41:23.379 --> 00:41:25.846 position:16% line:83% align:start

But I'm just a queen who cares.

00:41:27.547 --> 00:41:28.080 position:38% line:89% align:start
Miyuki,

00:41:30.047 --> 00:41:31.314 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm so glad you're safe.

00:41:41.116 --> 00:41:41.416 position:21% line:89% align:start
Where's the old man?

00:41:43.217 --> 00:41:45.084 position:27% line:83% align:start
He could be dead
for all I care!

00:41:47.918 --> 00:41:50.185 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm dying.

00:42:00.521 --> 00:42:02.887 position:21% line:89% align:start
Maybe he went home.

00:42:02.887 --> 00:42:03.154 position:35% line:89% align:start
Who cares?

00:42:05.155 --> 00:42:06.189 position:21% line:83% align:start
All he thinks about
is himself.

00:42:09.223 --> 00:42:14.057 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yeah, Miss Hana, but you're
in love with him, aren't you?

00:42:14.057 --> 00:42:18.192 position:7% line:83% align:start
Don't be silly! I like my men
to be more "manly."

00:42:18.192 --> 00:42:23.426 position:13% line:83% align:start
The kind of man I like is
slender, middle-aged, tanned,

00:42:23.426 --> 00:42:24.826 position:30% line:83% align:start
with a divine
square-back haircut

00:42:24.826 --> 00:42:25.294 position:16% line:89% align:start
and a lower-town accent,

00:42:26.994 --> 00:42:30.295 position:7% line:89% align:start
who says, "Ah, what the hell"

00:42:30.295 --> 00:42:32.462 position:16% line:83% align:start
when I don't quite have
the cab fare.

00:42:36.463 --> 00:42:39.364 position:16% line:89% align:start
So, what now, Miss Hana?

00:42:39.364 --> 00:42:43.365 position:30% line:83% align:start
Why so proper?
Geezer Grandma is fine.

00:42:43.365 --> 00:42:44.964 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's too long.

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:53.433 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm glad.

00:42:57.101 --> 00:42:58.368 position:21% line:89% align:start
He just died there?

00:42:58.368 --> 00:42:59.901 position:27% line:89% align:start
He was homeless.

00:42:59.901 --> 00:43:01.569 position:27% line:89% align:start
I might be next.

00:43:01.569 --> 00:43:02.736 position:24% line:89% align:start
Just do your job.

00:43:02.736 --> 00:43:04.403 position:44% line:89% align:start

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:12.237 position:30% line:89% align:start
Take it easy.

00:43:12.237 --> 00:43:13.472 position:44% line:89% align:start
Gin!

00:43:13.472 --> 00:43:14.505 position:35% line:89% align:start
Calm down!

00:43:24.173 --> 00:43:26.841 position:30% line:83% align:start
Where is that
good-for-nothing man?!

00:43:28.275 --> 00:43:32.476 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kiyo....

00:43:34.076 --> 00:43:38.277 position:24% line:89% align:start
If only tonight...

00:43:40.544 --> 00:43:43.878 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wanted to see you
before I died.

00:43:46.746 --> 00:43:49.013 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kiyoko!

00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:08.217 position:21% line:83% align:start
What is your desire?
My magic, or an ambulance?

00:44:10.351 --> 00:44:12.451 position:30% line:83% align:start
-An ambulance.
-Well! Aren't you rude!

00:44:14.152 --> 00:44:16.386 position:16% line:89% align:start
What are we going to do?

00:44:16.386 --> 00:44:18.720 position:24% line:83% align:start
Kiyoko can't sleep
out on the street!

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.420 position:16% line:89% align:start
The old man's not here,

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:22.887 position:16% line:83% align:start
we're freezing, sleepy,
and hungry.

00:44:22.887 --> 00:44:23.887 position:33% line:89% align:start
This sucks!

00:44:25.254 --> 00:44:27.322 position:13% line:89% align:start
I guess there's no choice.

00:44:33.889 --> 00:44:35.524 position:27% line:83% align:start
I never thought
I'd be here again.

00:44:43.159 --> 00:44:46.092 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry. We're closed for
a private party tonight--

00:44:48.727 --> 00:44:49.527 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hana?!

00:44:51.193 --> 00:44:53.028 position:19% line:83% align:start
I know I have no right
to come strolling in now,

00:44:55.361 --> 00:44:58.062 position:16% line:83% align:start
but there's no one else
I can call on, "Mother"!

00:45:03.196 --> 00:45:04.363 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hana!

00:45:05.364 --> 00:45:06.864 position:38% line:89% align:start
Mother!

00:45:06.864 --> 00:45:07.897 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hana!

00:45:15.966 --> 00:45:16.466 position:35% line:89% align:start
Old man?!

00:45:20.467 --> 00:45:21.567 position:21% line:89% align:start
What happened, Gin?!

00:45:24.669 --> 00:45:26.403 position:19% line:89% align:start
Some kids beat me up.

00:45:28.569 --> 00:45:30.537 position:21% line:83% align:start
I guess I'm just not
an action hero.

00:45:35.971 --> 00:45:36.971 position:27% line:83% align:start
Can't believe he
is a friend of yours.

00:45:38.871 --> 00:45:41.039 position:16% line:83% align:start
He said he was homeless,
you know.

00:45:42.406 --> 00:45:44.040 position:38% line:89% align:start
So am I.

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:47.340 position:27% line:89% align:start
What? But why?!

00:45:49.274 --> 00:45:51.741 position:5% line:89% align:start
Since he died I'm like a canary,

00:45:51.741 --> 00:45:53.042 position:13% line:89% align:start
that's forgotten its song.

00:45:54.475 --> 00:45:56.008 position:19% line:89% align:start
You sing all the time!

00:45:57.842 --> 00:45:59.543 position:27% line:89% align:start
Isn't she cute?!

00:45:59.543 --> 00:46:00.476 position:16% line:89% align:start
I wish I could have one!

00:46:06.512 --> 00:46:09.413 position:21% line:89% align:start
So Ken died, did he?

00:46:11.912 --> 00:46:12.346 position:41% line:89% align:start
AIDS?

00:46:14.447 --> 00:46:17.113 position:19% line:83% align:start
He slipped on the soap
in the bathtub.

00:46:17.113 --> 00:46:19.114 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, death is always
a hair's breadth away.

00:46:21.782 --> 00:46:24.516 position:10% line:83% align:start
But if you were in trouble,
why didn't you come back?

00:46:28.216 --> 00:46:30.850 position:13% line:83% align:start
We certainly had fun here,
didn't we?

00:46:32.984 --> 00:46:34.251 position:27% line:89% align:start
In this old bar

00:46:35.851 --> 00:46:38.851 position:13% line:89% align:start
I've had so much to drink

00:46:40.286 --> 00:46:41.852 position:27% line:89% align:start
My old memories

00:46:42.986 --> 00:46:47.321 position:24% line:89% align:start
All start to blur

00:46:47.321 --> 00:46:50.021 position:38% line:89% align:start
My lover

00:46:50.021 --> 00:46:52.922 position:33% line:89% align:start
Has left me

00:46:54.723 --> 00:46:59.057 position:16% line:89% align:start
People call me notorious

00:47:00.023 --> 00:47:01.158 position:27% line:89% align:start
Aw, you're ugly!

00:47:02.358 --> 00:47:04.124 position:27% line:89% align:start
Good for nothing

00:47:04.792 --> 00:47:04.924 position:38% line:89% align:start
Get off!

00:47:05.925 --> 00:47:08.125 position:27% line:89% align:start
Good for nothing

00:47:09.826 --> 00:47:13.493 position:10% line:89% align:start
What a terrible thing to say

00:47:13.493 --> 00:47:15.461 position:27% line:89% align:start
Eat shit, Pops!

00:47:18.094 --> 00:47:21.128 position:24% line:83% align:start
"Shit" I'll take,
but "Pops" I won't!

00:47:29.164 --> 00:47:30.497 position:21% line:83% align:start
I couldn't come back
after I'd done that.

00:47:32.964 --> 00:47:36.633 position:19% line:83% align:start
A little bit of money
took care of that.

00:47:36.633 --> 00:47:38.599 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm just happy you're all right.

00:47:42.033 --> 00:47:44.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
Stop it! You scare me
when you start crying.

00:47:47.301 --> 00:47:50.235 position:19% line:83% align:start
What about that baby?
Is the girl its mother?

00:47:50.902 --> 00:47:51.935 position:38% line:89% align:start
Well....

00:47:55.969 --> 00:47:58.870 position:7% line:89% align:start
Where is your mother, anyway?

00:48:00.371 --> 00:48:01.772 position:33% line:89% align:start
Abandoned?!

00:48:01.772 --> 00:48:04.505 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yes! I've been abandoned!

00:48:07.773 --> 00:48:09.606 position:10% line:89% align:start
Them's the breaks, I guess.

00:48:11.708 --> 00:48:12.541 position:19% line:89% align:start
I could see me in her.

00:48:15.041 --> 00:48:17.175 position:21% line:83% align:start
Born on the street,
and back there again.

00:48:19.743 --> 00:48:25.010 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's why I want to find her
a home full of love!

00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:28.911 position:10% line:89% align:start
All I ever wanted was love!

00:48:36.313 --> 00:48:36.879 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ow!

00:48:43.748 --> 00:48:45.248 position:27% line:89% align:start
What the hell?!

00:48:48.982 --> 00:48:49.982 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

00:48:51.216 --> 00:48:51.982 position:19% line:89% align:start
Where are my clothes?!

00:49:02.419 --> 00:49:03.619 position:27% line:89% align:start
Way to go, Gin!

00:49:05.919 --> 00:49:07.620 position:21% line:89% align:start
Come back any time.

00:49:09.454 --> 00:49:11.188 position:24% line:89% align:start
Thank you, Mother.

00:49:14.823 --> 00:49:16.255 position:16% line:89% align:start
My mother's white breath

00:49:16.255 --> 00:49:17.656 position:13% line:89% align:start
as she watches me set out

00:49:17.656 --> 00:49:18.489 position:24% line:89% align:start
on a long journey.

00:49:52.297 --> 00:49:52.630 position:7% line:83% align:start
DEAR HANA. A LITTLE EARLY, BUT
NEW YEAR'S MONEY. FROM MOTHER.

00:50:36.742 --> 00:50:37.641 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, man!

00:50:40.641 --> 00:50:43.008 position:5% line:83% align:start
An empty building's always nice,
but look who got here first.

00:50:47.343 --> 00:50:49.977 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'd just love to fill up
on some meat!

00:50:50.944 --> 00:50:52.378 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't you dare!

00:50:54.645 --> 00:50:56.445 position:30% line:89% align:start
Just kidding!

00:51:02.447 --> 00:51:05.447 position:24% line:83% align:start
The snow's let up.
Miyuki, will you go shopping?

00:51:05.447 --> 00:51:06.749 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:51:06.749 --> 00:51:08.315 position:24% line:89% align:start
Get me some saké.

00:51:09.515 --> 00:51:10.648 position:35% line:89% align:start
Just one.

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:31.086 position:44% line:83% align:start
-No!
-I wish.

00:51:48.791 --> 00:51:49.424 position:24% line:89% align:start
"Honey, I'm home."

00:52:08.629 --> 00:52:13.397 position:21% line:83% align:start
You stayed in there?
You'd think you were homeless!

00:52:19.164 --> 00:52:21.265 position:10% line:83% align:start
Actually, we're looking for
these people.

00:52:23.499 --> 00:52:24.932 position:24% line:89% align:start
Sachiko Nishizawa.

00:52:25.867 --> 00:52:26.133 position:27% line:89% align:start
Do you know her?

00:52:28.634 --> 00:52:31.801 position:7% line:83% align:start
She never paid me back for her
Neighborhood Association dues.

00:52:31.801 --> 00:52:34.535 position:21% line:89% align:start
Are you a relative?

00:52:34.535 --> 00:52:37.569 position:16% line:83% align:start
No! We're acquaintances
of a relative.

00:52:39.136 --> 00:52:39.569 position:13% line:89% align:start
Her husband was no better.

00:52:42.137 --> 00:52:45.370 position:16% line:83% align:start
Gambling day and night,
and mean when he drank.

00:52:48.605 --> 00:52:51.172 position:7% line:83% align:start
Living on his wife's earnings
and borrowed money.

00:52:51.172 --> 00:52:53.506 position:21% line:89% align:start
Where are they now?

00:52:53.506 --> 00:52:55.973 position:27% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't know.
Mrs. Kurumizawa might.

00:52:57.906 --> 00:52:59.574 position:35% line:83% align:start
They left
about three months ago.

00:53:02.641 --> 00:53:07.476 position:7% line:83% align:start
The house was seized for debt.
One night they just up and went.

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:10.610 position:16% line:83% align:start
They were a nice couple
at first,

00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:16.745 position:13% line:83% align:start
but it wasn't long before
they started fighting.

00:53:16.745 --> 00:53:19.612 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's poverty for you.

00:53:19.612 --> 00:53:23.613 position:7% line:83% align:start
All that debt didn't stop him
from lording it over her.

00:53:23.613 --> 00:53:26.280 position:10% line:83% align:start
Even the most dedicated wife
has her limits.

00:53:28.113 --> 00:53:30.014 position:10% line:89% align:start
You'd see bruises sometimes.

00:53:30.014 --> 00:53:32.114 position:27% line:89% align:start
The poor woman.

00:53:32.114 --> 00:53:34.716 position:21% line:89% align:start
Not on her, on him!

00:53:34.716 --> 00:53:34.649 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, dear!

00:53:37.482 --> 00:53:43.084 position:19% line:83% align:start
But the wife's mother
always took the husband's side.

00:53:45.117 --> 00:53:46.352 position:19% line:83% align:start
His parents built them
this house.

00:53:47.719 --> 00:53:49.886 position:21% line:89% align:start
Where do they live?

00:53:49.886 --> 00:53:51.319 position:10% line:89% align:start
Mrs. Yamanouchi might know.

00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:55.087 position:24% line:83% align:start
Her mother-in-law
was always complaining

00:53:57.053 --> 00:53:59.255 position:24% line:83% align:start
that she never did
any housework.

00:53:59.255 --> 00:54:01.522 position:16% line:83% align:start
But her son was perfect,
of course.

00:54:01.522 --> 00:54:04.856 position:35% line:83% align:start
Of course!
That's why I told her

00:54:04.856 --> 00:54:07.423 position:10% line:83% align:start
she'd never see a grandchild
with his wife working in a club.

00:54:08.956 --> 00:54:11.990 position:13% line:89% align:start
But she did get pregnant.

00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:14.324 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well, a man and a woman....

00:54:14.324 --> 00:54:16.024 position:10% line:89% align:start
They can always find time...

00:54:16.024 --> 00:54:18.592 position:19% line:89% align:start
to do what they must!

00:54:18.592 --> 00:54:21.226 position:27% line:83% align:start
SHINKOCHO 1-2-25
MAISON HAPPINESS APT. 203

00:54:23.493 --> 00:54:24.326 position:21% line:83% align:start
What if they ran out
from this new place too?

00:54:25.694 --> 00:54:26.027 position:21% line:89% align:start
What a horrible man!

00:54:28.895 --> 00:54:32.629 position:5% line:83% align:start
Poor Sachiko! Working to pay off
her husband's gambling debts!

00:54:33.529 --> 00:54:34.329 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:38.697 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I never thought of
abandoning the kid!

00:54:40.097 --> 00:54:42.632 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Nothing.

00:54:42.632 --> 00:54:45.331 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's no reason
to just dump the kid!

00:54:46.866 --> 00:54:47.599 position:13% line:89% align:start
I've said that all along.

00:54:51.567 --> 00:54:55.268 position:24% line:83% align:start
MIYUKI: ANGEL HAS
COME HOME. DAD.

00:55:00.669 --> 00:55:02.569 position:13% line:83% align:start
Doesn't it ever get tired
of snowing?

00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:07.170 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

00:55:17.373 --> 00:55:21.507 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wonder how we look
to them.

00:55:21.507 --> 00:55:22.174 position:21% line:83% align:start
Like a bum, a queer,
a runaway and a foundling.

00:55:24.607 --> 00:55:26.708 position:13% line:83% align:start
Kiyoko is God's messenger.
We're her servants.

00:55:28.708 --> 00:55:29.709 position:27% line:89% align:start
Unpaid servants.

00:55:31.342 --> 00:55:32.975 position:10% line:89% align:start
Paying for a father's sins.

00:55:35.243 --> 00:55:38.478 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yeah, if her father had been
any good at all,

00:55:38.478 --> 00:55:39.645 position:21% line:83% align:start
we wouldn't be going
through all this.

00:55:42.712 --> 00:55:46.546 position:7% line:83% align:start
Even a good-for-nothing father
never forgets a child.

00:55:49.079 --> 00:55:50.280 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm going out.

00:55:55.281 --> 00:55:58.549 position:10% line:89% align:start
What's the matter with her?

00:55:58.549 --> 00:56:01.016 position:19% line:83% align:start
A child never forgets
its parents, either.

00:56:06.184 --> 00:56:08.585 position:21% line:89% align:start
I never stop wanting

00:56:10.485 --> 00:56:13.052 position:7% line:89% align:start
to see my daughter, just once.

00:56:13.052 --> 00:56:14.619 position:27% line:89% align:start
So she's alive?

00:56:15.586 --> 00:56:16.952 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:56:16.952 --> 00:56:17.554 position:30% line:89% align:start
And your wife?

00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:20.986 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm sure she's remarried,

00:56:22.188 --> 00:56:23.987 position:21% line:89% align:start
and living happily.

00:56:29.289 --> 00:56:30.056 position:38% line:89% align:start
"Hello.

00:56:31.123 --> 00:56:32.156 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's me, Miyuki."

00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:34.256 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why did you split up?

00:56:36.090 --> 00:56:37.324 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Drinking and gambling.
-What?!

00:56:38.991 --> 00:56:39.692 position:30% line:89% align:start
Just like....

00:56:41.459 --> 00:56:42.725 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm a louse.

00:56:45.793 --> 00:56:49.093 position:10% line:83% align:start
But I've always wanted to do
something for her as a father,

00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:50.727 position:21% line:89% align:start
even just a little.

00:56:53.495 --> 00:56:54.728 position:21% line:83% align:start
When I was gambling
this would have been nothing.

00:56:57.463 --> 00:57:00.530 position:10% line:83% align:start
Now I've had to sweat blood
just to save 30,000 yen.

00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:01.597 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's great, Gin!

00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:03.730 position:16% line:89% align:start
We can stuff ourselves!

00:57:04.765 --> 00:57:05.631 position:35% line:89% align:start
Stuff you!

00:57:15.934 --> 00:57:16.667 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ishida speaking.

00:57:26.169 --> 00:57:28.670 position:21% line:89% align:start
Miyuki? Is that you?

00:57:31.604 --> 00:57:32.337 position:24% line:89% align:start
Are you all right?

00:57:38.738 --> 00:57:40.172 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry!

00:57:40.172 --> 00:57:41.506 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry!

00:57:42.539 --> 00:57:43.973 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry!

00:57:47.106 --> 00:57:49.308 position:35% line:83% align:start
Excuse me,
but if you wouldn't mind....

00:57:49.308 --> 00:57:49.508 position:21% line:89% align:start
"Get out," you mean?

00:57:51.608 --> 00:57:55.242 position:27% line:83% align:start
Other customers
might like to sit down.

00:57:55.242 --> 00:57:56.543 position:10% line:89% align:start
There's hardly anyone here!

00:57:56.543 --> 00:57:57.410 position:27% line:89% align:start
You guys stink!

00:57:59.510 --> 00:58:01.377 position:30% line:83% align:start
What are you?
Homeless or something?

00:58:03.845 --> 00:58:06.645 position:13% line:83% align:start
Does trash have kids too?
Just like real people?

00:58:08.078 --> 00:58:09.580 position:16% line:89% align:start
Who are you looking at?

00:58:12.213 --> 00:58:13.079 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hold it, you!

00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:16.414 position:38% line:89% align:start
Sir! No!

00:58:16.414 --> 00:58:17.614 position:7% line:89% align:start
Hold it, I said, you low-life!

00:58:28.784 --> 00:58:29.983 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's New Year's Sale time
at The Food Store!

00:58:32.885 --> 00:58:39.085 position:7% line:83% align:start
Come to The Food Store for all
your special New Year's needs!

00:58:39.085 --> 00:58:41.687 position:21% line:83% align:start
See in the New Year
with your family!

00:58:41.687 --> 00:58:42.620 position:13% line:89% align:start
Call an ambulance, quick.

00:58:43.821 --> 00:58:44.688 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:58:49.322 --> 00:58:52.690 position:10% line:83% align:start
I knew it! Kiyoko really is
the messenger of God!

00:58:55.756 --> 00:58:55.656 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:58:57.057 --> 00:58:57.157 position:35% line:89% align:start
Miss Hana!

00:58:57.791 --> 00:58:59.424 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:58:59.424 --> 00:59:00.057 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hana!

00:59:17.461 --> 00:59:17.661 position:24% line:83% align:start
Following a recent
gang shooting incident,

00:59:20.729 --> 00:59:24.563 position:7% line:83% align:start
police are seeking a fugitive,
thought to be of Latin descent.

00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:27.164 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mitsuo Hiruta, shot three times,

00:59:29.464 --> 00:59:31.097 position:16% line:83% align:start
in protecting the leader
of his syndicate,

00:59:33.732 --> 00:59:37.566 position:16% line:83% align:start
will be questioned after
he recovers from his wounds.

00:59:39.533 --> 00:59:41.667 position:27% line:83% align:start
Isn't she cute!
When was she born?

00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:45.235 position:19% line:89% align:start
Not long ago, I guess.

00:59:46.301 --> 00:59:47.869 position:24% line:89% align:start
So the mother....

00:59:47.869 --> 00:59:49.069 position:38% line:89% align:start
I'm not.

00:59:50.035 --> 00:59:51.369 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's her name?

00:59:51.369 --> 00:59:53.237 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kiyoko.

00:59:53.237 --> 00:59:56.070 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's my name too.
What a coincidence.

00:59:59.371 --> 01:00:02.539 position:13% line:89% align:start
Your friend is very weak.

01:00:02.539 --> 01:00:04.038 position:13% line:83% align:start
Make sure she gets plenty
of rest and proper nutrition.

01:00:04.739 --> 01:00:05.405 position:38% line:89% align:start
Doctor!

01:00:07.373 --> 01:00:09.707 position:24% line:83% align:start
Believe it or not,
we're homeless.

01:00:09.707 --> 01:00:11.241 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm just a doctor.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:18.242 position:10% line:83% align:start
Rest and nutrition don't fit
with our lifestyle, you realize.

01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:23.611 position:13% line:89% align:start
I can try to cure disease.

01:00:23.611 --> 01:00:24.611 position:19% line:83% align:start
Lifestyle is something
you have to fix.

01:00:26.277 --> 01:00:28.712 position:5% line:89% align:start
All anyone can do is their best.

01:00:31.613 --> 01:00:33.045 position:35% line:89% align:start
Take care.

01:00:37.447 --> 01:00:40.915 position:24% line:83% align:start
The bill for today
is 29,830 yen.

01:00:40.915 --> 01:00:44.047 position:5% line:83% align:start
Bring your health insurance card
and you'll get a refund.

01:00:45.616 --> 01:00:47.249 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, Gin!

01:00:49.483 --> 01:00:52.049 position:16% line:83% align:start
Stop crying! You'll get
the bills all wet.

01:00:53.217 --> 01:00:54.684 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's 30,000 yen.

01:01:11.388 --> 01:01:12.221 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kiyoko?!

01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:18.256 position:44% line:89% align:start
Dad?

01:01:41.862 --> 01:01:43.328 position:16% line:89% align:start
So you took up nursing.

01:01:45.029 --> 01:01:46.796 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

01:01:49.898 --> 01:01:52.397 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm glad you're well.

01:01:52.397 --> 01:01:57.164 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, yeah, I'm just great.
How's your mother?

01:01:57.164 --> 01:01:58.165 position:41% line:89% align:start
Fine.

01:01:59.666 --> 01:02:01.165 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah? That's good.

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.834 position:16% line:89% align:start
What are you doing now?

01:02:04.834 --> 01:02:10.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm in recycling. I had to
drop something off here.

01:02:14.702 --> 01:02:15.737 position:24% line:89% align:start
You must hate me.

01:02:18.370 --> 01:02:20.337 position:21% line:83% align:start
I was never any kind
of a father to you.

01:02:22.971 --> 01:02:27.605 position:7% line:83% align:start
But that 30,000 yen was money
I'd saved up for you.

01:02:29.773 --> 01:02:30.640 position:16% line:89% align:start
You may not believe it.

01:02:34.841 --> 01:02:37.241 position:10% line:89% align:start
I always wanted to see you.

01:02:39.775 --> 01:02:41.743 position:24% line:83% align:start
When I was little,
Mom and I searched for you.

01:02:44.042 --> 01:02:45.310 position:27% line:83% align:start
We even checked
unidentified corpses.

01:02:47.810 --> 01:02:51.044 position:19% line:83% align:start
After you disappeared,
Mom ran the store herself.

01:02:52.211 --> 01:02:54.579 position:35% line:89% align:start
The store?

01:02:54.579 --> 01:02:57.245 position:7% line:83% align:start
It was hard for a woman to run
a bicycle shop alone.

01:02:59.513 --> 01:03:01.113 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's not quite the same as
a bicycle racer.

01:03:02.447 --> 01:03:06.314 position:13% line:89% align:start
The man you owed money to

01:03:06.314 --> 01:03:08.582 position:21% line:83% align:start
was shot and wounded
the other day, you know.

01:03:08.582 --> 01:03:09.382 position:35% line:89% align:start
He lived?!

01:03:10.882 --> 01:03:13.449 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's a relief.

01:03:13.449 --> 01:03:14.716 position:13% line:89% align:start
I thought you'd say that.

01:03:18.350 --> 01:03:22.385 position:10% line:89% align:start
I ran up the debts, not him.

01:03:25.452 --> 01:03:28.654 position:13% line:83% align:start
Thank that doctor for me.
He seems like a nice guy.

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:32.086 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm getting married.

01:03:34.288 --> 01:03:36.087 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh? That's good.

01:03:36.087 --> 01:03:38.188 position:38% line:89% align:start
To him.

01:03:38.188 --> 01:03:40.756 position:21% line:83% align:start
Great! But isn't he
about my age?

01:03:43.456 --> 01:03:45.591 position:24% line:83% align:start
He's been married.
His daughter got sick and died,

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:48.791 position:13% line:89% align:start
and his wife followed her.

01:03:54.893 --> 01:03:56.693 position:13% line:89% align:start
That man makes me so mad!

01:03:56.693 --> 01:03:57.393 position:24% line:89% align:start
Aren't you moved?

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:01.794 position:24% line:83% align:start
Here's the address
and phone number.

01:04:01.794 --> 01:04:02.060 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yours?

01:04:03.295 --> 01:04:06.295 position:19% line:89% align:start
The old house is gone.

01:04:06.295 --> 01:04:07.496 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even if you can't now,
call me sometime.

01:04:09.129 --> 01:04:11.195 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kiyoko!

01:04:14.096 --> 01:04:17.831 position:30% line:83% align:start
I've had about
all I can stand!

01:04:17.831 --> 01:04:19.097 position:35% line:89% align:start
Miss Hana?

01:04:19.097 --> 01:04:21.198 position:10% line:89% align:start
Telling us you were a racer!

01:04:22.866 --> 01:04:24.767 position:13% line:89% align:start
I was always at the track.

01:04:24.767 --> 01:04:24.733 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, betting!

01:04:27.166 --> 01:04:31.334 position:10% line:83% align:start
And your debts snowballed so
you couldn't face your family,

01:04:31.334 --> 01:04:32.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
and you ran and hid
in a cardboard box!

01:04:32.801 --> 01:04:35.002 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yes, damn it!

01:04:35.002 --> 01:04:35.468 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's what your father is!

01:04:38.536 --> 01:04:42.337 position:7% line:83% align:start
He can't bet, he's spineless,
his feet stink and he's a drunk!

01:04:42.337 --> 01:04:46.271 position:19% line:83% align:start
He kills off his wife
and daughter to buy sympathy!

01:04:46.271 --> 01:04:49.204 position:13% line:83% align:start
He said you had died from
an incurable disease.

01:04:49.204 --> 01:04:52.539 position:16% line:83% align:start
With a father like that,
you have my sympathy!

01:04:54.105 --> 01:04:56.373 position:13% line:89% align:start
Is this how you repay me?!

01:04:57.273 --> 01:04:58.140 position:33% line:89% align:start
Repay you?!

01:04:59.308 --> 01:04:59.441 position:21% line:89% align:start
Am I hearing right?

01:05:02.107 --> 01:05:04.242 position:10% line:83% align:start
If we're talking about debt,
I'm waiting for my change!

01:05:04.242 --> 01:05:04.475 position:27% line:83% align:start
Debt's a concept
you don't even understand!

01:05:07.043 --> 01:05:10.577 position:10% line:83% align:start
You understand how to troll
through garbage cans!

01:05:10.577 --> 01:05:13.744 position:19% line:83% align:start
And how to get in debt
and how to make babies.

01:05:13.744 --> 01:05:17.412 position:13% line:83% align:start
Though you're not too good
at raising them, are you?

01:05:17.412 --> 01:05:20.546 position:30% line:83% align:start
And your debts
you shove off on your wife.

01:05:20.546 --> 01:05:21.613 position:21% line:83% align:start
Always running away,
never doing anything right!

01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:25.147 position:30% line:83% align:start
Running away's
the only racing you ever did!

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.781 position:19% line:89% align:start
Miyuki! We're leaving!

01:05:31.982 --> 01:05:32.782 position:35% line:89% align:start
Miss Hana?

01:05:39.051 --> 01:05:40.350 position:13% line:89% align:start
Someone's feeling better.

01:05:42.585 --> 01:05:44.785 position:13% line:83% align:start
Should you have said that
in front of her?

01:05:48.619 --> 01:05:50.853 position:19% line:83% align:start
If she's his daughter,
she'll forgive him.

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:57.955 position:13% line:89% align:start
Being able to speak freely

01:05:57.955 --> 01:06:00.121 position:13% line:89% align:start
is the lifeblood of love.

01:06:01.689 --> 01:06:02.522 position:27% line:89% align:start
Maybe I'm nïve.

01:06:06.156 --> 01:06:09.090 position:10% line:89% align:start
So you're in love with him?

01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:11.857 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't be silly.
I'm the "Blue Devil".

01:06:11.857 --> 01:06:12.291 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?

01:06:13.458 --> 01:06:15.491 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's a story I love.

01:06:17.026 --> 01:06:20.026 position:13% line:89% align:start
There was a Red Devil who

01:06:20.026 --> 01:06:20.526 position:33% line:83% align:start
wanted to be
friends with people.

01:06:23.427 --> 01:06:28.261 position:13% line:83% align:start
But since he was a devil,
no one would go near him.

01:06:28.261 --> 01:06:30.495 position:10% line:83% align:start
So his friend the Blue Devil
made a plan.

01:06:32.529 --> 01:06:35.763 position:27% line:83% align:start
He'd wreak havoc
among the people,

01:06:35.763 --> 01:06:37.330 position:24% line:83% align:start
and the Red Devil
would save them.

01:06:43.565 --> 01:06:45.131 position:27% line:83% align:start
WHEN YOU TRY TO
ACHIEVE SOMETHING...

01:06:45.131 --> 01:06:45.865 position:10% line:89% align:start
SOMEONE'S BOUND TO GET HURT.

01:06:48.232 --> 01:06:49.433 position:24% line:83% align:start
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO
SACRIFICE SOMETHING.

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:51.500 position:27% line:89% align:start
The plan worked.

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:56.401 position:24% line:83% align:start
But the Blue Devil
had to go away

01:06:56.401 --> 01:06:57.468 position:21% line:83% align:start
so they'd never know
it was a trick.

01:07:00.936 --> 01:07:03.336 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's a sad story.

01:07:03.336 --> 01:07:05.637 position:13% line:83% align:start
But that means you leave.
Where will you go?

01:07:08.671 --> 01:07:11.438 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's best for everyone when
they're with their real family.

01:07:11.438 --> 01:07:11.738 position:5% line:89% align:start
Soon we'll find Kiyoko's mother.

01:07:14.305 --> 01:07:17.373 position:30% line:83% align:start
And then what?
You don't have a real family!

01:07:28.076 --> 01:07:32.043 position:5% line:89% align:start
RARE 'LINE OF ONES' WINS LOTTERY

01:07:32.043 --> 01:07:34.444 position:5% line:83% align:start
Numbers have been drawn for the
annual New Year's Jumbo Lottery.

01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:39.345 position:5% line:83% align:start
Top prize in the 200-million-yen
lottery is a very rare number.

01:07:40.945 --> 01:07:43.646 position:13% line:89% align:start
Group 11, number 111, 111,

01:07:45.112 --> 01:07:46.713 position:16% line:89% align:start
is worth 50 million yen.

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:49.180 position:24% line:83% align:start
A different group
pays 100,000 yen.

01:07:51.414 --> 01:07:53.581 position:35% line:83% align:start
To repeat,
the winning prize number is....

01:07:56.016 --> 01:07:56.248 position:30% line:89% align:start
This just in.

01:07:58.782 --> 01:08:02.483 position:7% line:83% align:start
Police have released a sketch
of an infant taken

01:08:02.483 --> 01:08:05.250 position:24% line:83% align:start
from a hospital in
Tokyo's Shinagawa Ward.

01:08:08.919 --> 01:08:13.620 position:10% line:83% align:start
We've come all the way here,
but we don't have her address!

01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:16.020 position:19% line:83% align:start
The old man's got it!
Let's go back.

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:17.654 position:21% line:89% align:start
Where are you going?

01:08:20.454 --> 01:08:23.521 position:33% line:83% align:start
-The police!
-What? You hated that idea!

01:08:25.055 --> 01:08:25.889 position:16% line:89% align:start
I was just ego-tripping.

01:08:28.189 --> 01:08:31.890 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now I want to apologize
to her parents.

01:08:31.890 --> 01:08:33.857 position:5% line:83% align:start
They might not be able to sleep
waiting for news about her.

01:08:36.291 --> 01:08:39.525 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's what we said
from the very start!

01:08:39.525 --> 01:08:42.225 position:10% line:89% align:start
They might be even about to

01:08:42.225 --> 01:08:44.493 position:30% line:83% align:start
commit suicide
because of the regret.

01:08:44.493 --> 01:08:47.494 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've done something
that can't be taken back!

01:08:47.494 --> 01:08:50.361 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll throw myself in this river.

01:08:50.361 --> 01:08:52.462 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll step neatly
out of my shoes,

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:54.929 position:19% line:83% align:start
stand on the handrail,
and be at peace.

01:08:54.929 --> 01:08:55.795 position:24% line:83% align:start
But then I'll see
a baby's face on the water.

01:08:58.329 --> 01:09:01.597 position:27% line:83% align:start
No! While I see
this child's face, I cannot die!

01:09:02.597 --> 01:09:04.098 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, you!

01:09:04.098 --> 01:09:05.298 position:44% line:89% align:start
No!

01:09:08.198 --> 01:09:09.299 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're too young for this!

01:09:09.299 --> 01:09:10.766 position:21% line:89% align:start
Please! Let me die!

01:09:18.901 --> 01:09:20.234 position:44% line:89% align:start
You!

01:09:21.334 --> 01:09:22.268 position:24% line:89% align:start
Sachiko Nishizawa.

01:09:27.336 --> 01:09:27.770 position:10% line:89% align:start
What were you thinking of?!

01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:32.204 position:5% line:89% align:start
Weren't you going to apologize?

01:09:32.204 --> 01:09:35.872 position:7% line:83% align:start
If we hadn't found this child,
she would've frozen to death!

01:09:35.872 --> 01:09:37.772 position:30% line:89% align:start
It wasn't me!

01:09:37.772 --> 01:09:39.840 position:16% line:83% align:start
My husband took her away
when I wasn't there!

01:09:41.873 --> 01:09:43.774 position:16% line:89% align:start
I've looked and looked!

01:09:51.808 --> 01:09:52.442 position:30% line:89% align:start
Is that true?

01:09:56.577 --> 01:10:00.645 position:24% line:83% align:start
All I've suffered
on account of that man!

01:10:12.246 --> 01:10:14.748 position:35% line:89% align:start
"Hi, Mom!"

01:10:23.816 --> 01:10:25.616 position:10% line:83% align:start
God really loves this child,
you know.

01:10:27.817 --> 01:10:29.384 position:19% line:83% align:start
I want you to give her
lots of love too.

01:10:31.451 --> 01:10:34.019 position:27% line:83% align:start
Do right by her,
or you'll pay for it.

01:10:34.019 --> 01:10:35.986 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm so sorry!

01:10:35.986 --> 01:10:36.719 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry!

01:10:47.187 --> 01:10:48.489 position:27% line:89% align:start
Mrs. Nishizawa!

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:35.833 position:10% line:89% align:start
What are you doing in here?!

01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:38.566 position:13% line:89% align:start
Get out of here! Get out!

01:11:39.934 --> 01:11:40.601 position:21% line:89% align:start
Wait! I'm no thief.

01:11:42.035 --> 01:11:44.301 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're lying! Get out!

01:11:44.301 --> 01:11:44.835 position:24% line:89% align:start
Where's the baby?!

01:11:49.703 --> 01:11:52.503 position:13% line:83% align:start
Did an old hag and a girl
come to give it back?

01:11:52.503 --> 01:11:54.203 position:10% line:89% align:start
What are you talking about?!

01:11:54.203 --> 01:11:55.637 position:19% line:89% align:start
You abandoned a baby!

01:11:58.271 --> 01:11:59.838 position:27% line:89% align:start
I can prove it.

01:12:01.005 --> 01:12:03.739 position:30% line:89% align:start
Are you a cop?

01:12:03.739 --> 01:12:07.407 position:21% line:83% align:start
Huh? I'm just a bum
who was passing by.

01:12:09.273 --> 01:12:11.608 position:13% line:89% align:start
Are you right in the head?

01:12:11.608 --> 01:12:12.241 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm damn near crazy
from all this!

01:12:13.708 --> 01:12:16.876 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why is the baby you abandoned

01:12:16.876 --> 01:12:19.309 position:21% line:83% align:start
on the news as being
"taken away"?

01:12:19.309 --> 01:12:20.543 position:10% line:89% align:start
They'll call us kidnappers!

01:12:22.510 --> 01:12:25.644 position:30% line:83% align:start
It wasn't me.
That's not my kid.

01:12:28.578 --> 01:12:28.945 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?

01:12:31.479 --> 01:12:33.946 position:16% line:89% align:start
There, there! Don't cry!

01:12:33.946 --> 01:12:34.513 position:35% line:89% align:start
Take care.

01:12:35.646 --> 01:12:37.480 position:27% line:89% align:start
Raise her right.

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:38.914 position:19% line:89% align:start
See you again someday.

01:12:41.348 --> 01:12:43.448 position:19% line:89% align:start
Never leave her again.

01:13:06.854 --> 01:13:08.688 position:19% line:89% align:start
On the year's last day

01:13:08.688 --> 01:13:10.254 position:30% line:83% align:start
when all of a
life's accounts

01:13:10.254 --> 01:13:11.321 position:19% line:89% align:start
have been settled up.

01:13:24.925 --> 01:13:29.793 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sachiko stole that baby
out of the hospital.

01:13:29.793 --> 01:13:32.627 position:27% line:83% align:start
She stole a baby
and then abandoned it?!

01:13:34.061 --> 01:13:34.694 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's a person's life!

01:13:36.094 --> 01:13:39.261 position:16% line:89% align:start
She lied to me about it!

01:13:39.261 --> 01:13:40.662 position:24% line:83% align:start
And now it's gone
way out of control.

01:13:42.796 --> 01:13:44.395 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't want anything
to do with it!

01:13:44.395 --> 01:13:45.963 position:10% line:89% align:start
Take the kid to the police!

01:13:46.863 --> 01:13:47.763 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?!

01:13:49.831 --> 01:13:53.065 position:30% line:83% align:start
Don't act like
you're not part of this!

01:13:53.065 --> 01:13:54.265 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't want to get involved?
You're her husband!

01:13:56.832 --> 01:13:59.433 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's all over! I'm getting
my life back together.

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:01.633 position:41% line:89% align:start
Look!

01:14:01.633 --> 01:14:04.001 position:24% line:83% align:start
I won 100,000 yen
in the lottery.

01:14:04.001 --> 01:14:04.867 position:24% line:89% align:start
My luck's turned!

01:14:08.702 --> 01:14:09.868 position:10% line:89% align:start
I know a guy just like you.

01:14:11.936 --> 01:14:13.736 position:30% line:83% align:start
He threw away
his life and his family.

01:14:15.336 --> 01:14:16.370 position:13% line:89% align:start
No. He threw himself away.

01:14:17.336 --> 01:14:18.837 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm no loser!

01:14:24.539 --> 01:14:25.872 position:7% line:89% align:start
These were in your wife's bag.

01:14:29.273 --> 01:14:30.640 position:30% line:83% align:start
Any idea where
she might have gone?

01:14:32.941 --> 01:14:34.741 position:19% line:83% align:start
She said she was going
to be with her baby.

01:14:36.441 --> 01:14:38.542 position:7% line:89% align:start
She was going to kill herself!

01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:43.077 position:13% line:89% align:start
There's no time to waste!

01:14:43.077 --> 01:14:46.877 position:19% line:83% align:start
No! She was just going
to go look for the kid.

01:14:46.877 --> 01:14:48.310 position:27% line:83% align:start
She's desperate.
That only means one thing!

01:14:50.578 --> 01:14:51.611 position:19% line:89% align:start
But where do I look?!

01:15:08.049 --> 01:15:09.183 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hana!

01:15:09.183 --> 01:15:10.248 position:38% line:89% align:start
Miyuki!

01:15:12.184 --> 01:15:13.249 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kiyoko!

01:15:20.552 --> 01:15:23.019 position:27% line:83% align:start
God must be busy
at this time of year.

01:15:23.019 --> 01:15:24.619 position:7% line:89% align:start
Better once a year than never.

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:26.252 position:38% line:89% align:start
Old man?

01:15:37.023 --> 01:15:40.456 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're too late. You just missed
a very moving finale.

01:15:40.456 --> 01:15:41.857 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's the matter?

01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:46.658 position:35% line:89% align:start
"Kiyoko"!

01:15:50.425 --> 01:15:50.926 position:35% line:89% align:start
"Stomach"?

01:15:53.759 --> 01:15:53.926 position:35% line:89% align:start
"Mother"!

01:15:55.326 --> 01:15:57.060 position:21% line:89% align:start
Now that's settled,

01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:57.393 position:10% line:89% align:start
what the hell do you mean?!

01:15:59.427 --> 01:16:02.327 position:24% line:83% align:start
Fake! The mother!
Sachiko's a fake!

01:16:04.962 --> 01:16:05.662 position:38% line:89% align:start
Pardon?

01:16:11.897 --> 01:16:13.397 position:21% line:89% align:start
Why won't you drink?

01:16:15.798 --> 01:16:18.598 position:21% line:83% align:start
A baby has to drink
from its mother's breast.

We'll never be close
if you don't!

01:16:30.835 --> 01:16:31.835 position:21% line:89% align:start
Sorry. Wrong people.

01:16:34.936 --> 01:16:35.969 position:24% line:89% align:start
She can't be far!

01:16:37.403 --> 01:16:39.636 position:19% line:89% align:start
But where do we look?

01:16:39.636 --> 01:16:41.470 position:7% line:89% align:start
We can't just give her up now!

01:16:54.941 --> 01:16:55.941 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's Kiyoko!

01:17:03.909 --> 01:17:05.676 position:19% line:89% align:start
Should you be running?

01:17:05.676 --> 01:17:07.510 position:5% line:89% align:start
If I don't run now, when will I?

01:17:08.376 --> 01:17:08.844 position:35% line:89% align:start
This way!

01:17:24.214 --> 01:17:26.181 position:19% line:83% align:start
Returning stolen goods
to a thief!

01:17:26.181 --> 01:17:27.981 position:13% line:89% align:start
How could we be so dumb?!

01:17:27.981 --> 01:17:29.582 position:13% line:89% align:start
Who said "family suicide"?

01:17:29.582 --> 01:17:30.682 position:38% line:89% align:start
You did!

01:17:37.483 --> 01:17:38.617 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Which way?
-Left.

01:17:38.617 --> 01:17:39.617 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Okay, right!
-Why?

01:17:41.051 --> 01:17:42.485 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're a lousy gambler!

01:17:42.485 --> 01:17:44.518 position:21% line:89% align:start
You got that right.

01:17:44.518 --> 01:17:45.952 position:30% line:89% align:start
Somebody help!

01:17:59.889 --> 01:18:00.856 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

01:18:01.756 --> 01:18:02.956 position:41% line:89% align:start
Wait!

01:18:02.956 --> 01:18:04.823 position:30% line:89% align:start
Thief! Thief!

01:18:04.823 --> 01:18:05.757 position:30% line:89% align:start
What's wrong?

01:18:05.757 --> 01:18:08.724 position:10% line:89% align:start
A woman just stole my truck!

01:18:09.858 --> 01:18:10.357 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey! Thief!

01:18:11.290 --> 01:18:12.625 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yes! That woman!

01:18:14.025 --> 01:18:16.325 position:21% line:89% align:start
She's a baby thief!

01:18:31.829 --> 01:18:33.997 position:21% line:83% align:start
Be quiet, will you?
Please! Be a good baby!

01:18:43.032 --> 01:18:44.599 position:16% line:89% align:start
Stop! Give Kiyoko back!

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:51.734 position:27% line:89% align:start
Give me a break!

01:18:51.734 --> 01:18:53.034 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm forever in your debt!

01:18:58.735 --> 01:18:59.401 position:44% line:89% align:start
Gin!

01:19:01.636 --> 01:19:03.302 position:21% line:89% align:start
That woman's crazy!

01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:04.470 position:33% line:89% align:start
Get closer!

01:19:05.138 --> 01:19:06.270 position:38% line:89% align:start
I can't!

01:19:06.270 --> 01:19:08.972 position:16% line:89% align:start
You have to, for Kiyoko!

01:19:08.972 --> 01:19:10.671 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Who's Kiyoko?!
-Step on it like a man!

01:19:10.671 --> 01:19:11.404 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay!

01:19:16.874 --> 01:19:18.840 position:24% line:89% align:start
Please! Be quiet!

01:19:23.142 --> 01:19:24.008 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Gin!
-Old man?!

01:19:27.642 --> 01:19:29.642 position:38% line:89% align:start
Old man!

01:19:29.642 --> 01:19:31.810 position:27% line:83% align:start
Go for it, Gin!
No action star can touch you!

01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:34.377 position:35% line:89% align:start
Pass her!

01:19:34.377 --> 01:19:34.477 position:35% line:89% align:start
We'll die!

01:19:35.377 --> 01:19:35.511 position:33% line:89% align:start
Step on it!

01:19:36.211 --> 01:19:37.511 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay!

01:19:39.812 --> 01:19:40.645 position:33% line:89% align:start
Stop crying!

01:19:42.913 --> 01:19:44.746 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't be afraid.
I'll never leave you again.

01:19:46.013 --> 01:19:46.479 position:24% line:89% align:start
You want to die?!

01:19:55.949 --> 01:19:57.549 position:44% line:89% align:start
Gin!

01:20:09.919 --> 01:20:10.986 position:44% line:89% align:start
Gin!

01:20:13.887 --> 01:20:14.553 position:41% line:89% align:start
There!

01:20:17.221 --> 01:20:18.554 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Are you okay?!
-Where's Kiyoko?

01:20:18.554 --> 01:20:19.621 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Faster!
-Okay!

01:20:39.826 --> 01:20:39.726 position:35% line:89% align:start
Which way?

01:21:27.637 --> 01:21:27.837 position:24% line:89% align:start
We're at the scene

01:21:30.404 --> 01:21:34.939 position:13% line:83% align:start
where a truck has crashed
into a building in Shinagawa.

01:21:34.939 --> 01:21:37.639 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now a woman holding a baby
has appeared on the roof.

01:21:39.107 --> 01:21:40.706 position:16% line:89% align:start
Witnesses say the woman

01:21:40.706 --> 01:21:44.241 position:5% line:89% align:start
is connected with the incident,

01:21:44.241 --> 01:21:45.641 position:7% line:89% align:start
as she was driving the truck.

01:21:52.743 --> 01:21:54.676 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now there's someone else
on the roof!

01:21:59.911 --> 01:22:00.878 position:35% line:89% align:start
Stay away!

01:22:00.878 --> 01:22:02.611 position:44% line:89% align:start
No!

01:22:10.413 --> 01:22:11.680 position:21% line:83% align:start
Tell me why you took
that baby.

01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:12.547 position:35% line:89% align:start
I didn't!

01:22:13.648 --> 01:22:17.015 position:24% line:89% align:start
This baby is mine!

01:22:17.015 --> 01:22:19.482 position:7% line:83% align:start
You're lying! Its real parents
are worried sick about it!

01:22:19.482 --> 01:22:22.082 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's not true!

01:22:22.082 --> 01:22:24.683 position:7% line:83% align:start
You of all people should know
what it's like to lose a child!

01:22:37.519 --> 01:22:41.520 position:16% line:83% align:start
She's dead. My baby died
before she was even born!

01:22:50.123 --> 01:22:53.224 position:7% line:83% align:start
All the other babies looked so
healthy there in the ward.

01:22:53.224 --> 01:22:56.456 position:27% line:89% align:start
I wanted to die.

01:22:56.456 --> 01:22:58.958 position:24% line:83% align:start
But then this baby
smiled at me.

01:22:58.958 --> 01:23:01.826 position:16% line:89% align:start
I decided she was mine.

01:23:01.826 --> 01:23:05.993 position:5% line:83% align:start
I thought as long as I had her,
everything would be fine.

01:23:05.993 --> 01:23:09.093 position:5% line:83% align:start
My husband would mend his ways,
and we'd be a real family.

01:23:09.093 --> 01:23:09.594 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's bullshit!

01:23:11.794 --> 01:23:14.495 position:30% line:83% align:start
Build a family
by ruining a baby's life?

01:23:14.495 --> 01:23:15.062 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you're going to die,
do it alone!

01:23:17.395 --> 01:23:19.629 position:24% line:83% align:start
A life is a life.
It's only born once.

01:23:19.629 --> 01:23:21.096 position:21% line:89% align:start
You, me, or Kiyoko.

01:23:27.199 --> 01:23:28.631 position:21% line:89% align:start
Give her back, okay?

01:23:36.433 --> 01:23:37.800 position:21% line:89% align:start
I want to be reborn.

01:23:39.134 --> 01:23:40.835 position:38% line:89% align:start
Sachiko!

01:23:43.302 --> 01:23:46.535 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sachiko, don't die!
Come back to me!

01:23:46.535 --> 01:23:48.636 position:33% line:83% align:start
I was wrong!
Please, don't kill yourself!

01:23:50.570 --> 01:23:52.070 position:24% line:83% align:start
We'll start again!
We'll be reborn!

01:23:52.938 --> 01:23:55.238 position:38% line:89% align:start
Sachiko!

01:23:55.238 --> 01:23:57.371 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll go first and wait for you.

01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:02.706 position:38% line:89% align:start
Sachiko!

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:07.540 position:21% line:89% align:start
Please! Let me die!

01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:09.674 position:21% line:83% align:start
Kiyoko wants to see
her mom and dad!

01:24:16.210 --> 01:24:16.909 position:24% line:89% align:start
I want to go home.

01:24:20.877 --> 01:24:22.710 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry!

01:24:30.812 --> 01:24:31.046 position:38% line:89% align:start
Take her

01:24:32.580 --> 01:24:34.613 position:13% line:89% align:start
to her mother and father.

01:24:44.249 --> 01:24:44.749 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, no.

01:24:46.116 --> 01:24:46.983 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hana!

01:24:49.184 --> 01:24:49.884 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm okay!

01:24:51.084 --> 01:24:51.884 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm still alive!

01:25:33.694 --> 01:25:37.761 position:16% line:83% align:start
Inspector, I don't know
how to thank you.

01:25:37.761 --> 01:25:40.529 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're not the ones
you should thank.

01:25:43.996 --> 01:25:48.630 position:10% line:83% align:start
Man, that was a good sleep!
Get me a cigarette, Miyuki.

01:25:48.630 --> 01:25:50.731 position:30% line:83% align:start
-In my jacket.
-Yeah, yeah.

01:25:50.731 --> 01:25:53.565 position:13% line:89% align:start
That was some New Year's!

01:25:55.066 --> 01:25:55.599 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's "No Smoking" here.

01:25:57.032 --> 01:26:00.133 position:16% line:89% align:start
Lighten up! I'm a hero!

01:26:00.133 --> 01:26:01.700 position:30% line:89% align:start
You mean "we"!

01:26:05.901 --> 01:26:08.768 position:27% line:83% align:start
I guess we won't
have to listen to

01:26:08.768 --> 01:26:11.436 position:7% line:89% align:start
Kiyoko's damn crying anymore.

01:26:11.436 --> 01:26:13.369 position:10% line:89% align:start
She's not "Kiyoko" anymore.

01:26:13.369 --> 01:26:15.470 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm not pleased.

01:26:16.537 --> 01:26:18.537 position:27% line:89% align:start
What can we do?

01:26:18.537 --> 01:26:19.738 position:27% line:89% align:start
Not about that.

01:26:21.172 --> 01:26:22.638 position:19% line:89% align:start
This is a men's ward!

01:26:26.139 --> 01:26:27.505 position:16% line:89% align:start
Perhaps we're intruding.

01:26:27.505 --> 01:26:28.974 position:30% line:89% align:start
No, it's just,

01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:33.041 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm told they're homeless.

01:26:33.041 --> 01:26:34.808 position:35% line:89% align:start
Who cares?

01:26:34.808 --> 01:26:36.809 position:21% line:83% align:start
We'd like them to be
her godfathers.

01:26:39.009 --> 01:26:39.642 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come in.

01:26:41.244 --> 01:26:41.476 position:35% line:89% align:start
Excuse us.

01:26:43.810 --> 01:26:45.944 position:24% line:83% align:start
The baby's parents
would like to thank you--

01:26:52.079 --> 01:26:52.979 position:38% line:89% align:start
Dad....
