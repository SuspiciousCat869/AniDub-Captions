1
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:49,836
‐Dammit.

2
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,185
When is this night gonna end?

3
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,141
‐It’s almost over.

4
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,390
Try and be patient.

5
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,641
‐If you go out now, Naraku
will find out that you lose

6
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,603
your demonic powers on
the night of the new moon,

7
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,015
and then you’ll be
wide open to his‐‐

8
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:04,522
‐All set.

9
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,186
I’m going.

10
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:05,904
INUYASHA: Kagome.

11
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,776
You better make it
back in one piece.

12
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,006
‐It’s way too quiet.

13
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,284
‐Father, Kohaku.

14
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,781
Tonight, I’ll finally get
revenge for our village.

15
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:58,833
Naraku!

16
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:10,837
Kilala!

17
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,145
Miroku, he’s coming your way!

18
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,981
‐I’ve waited for this, Naraku.

19
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:31,106
Feel the wrath of the
curse you set upon me.

20
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:32,243
Wind Tunnel!

21
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,829
What, Saimyosho?

22
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:47,497
‐Perish.

23
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,182
Impudent wench.

24
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,680
‐Naraku.

25
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,180
You’re going down!

26
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,102
I got him.

27
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,110
SHIPPO: Kagome, look out!

28
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:11,521
Transform!

29
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:15,493
‐Miroku!

30
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,384
‐Is that thing
Naraku’s true form.

31
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,382
‐Hey, Kagome.

32
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,673
‐Where’s Inuyasha?

33
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:33,804
‐Not yet.

34
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,720
‐Looks like we’re on our own.

35
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,801
We’ll have to do it without him.

36
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,844
‐Let’s go, Kilala.

37
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:40,928
‐OK then, Shippo.

38
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,434
Are you ready?

39
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,226
‐Yep.

40
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,728
S‐Sure you don’t wanna
put this off for a while.

41
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:48,903
‐Oh, come on, Shippo.

42
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,902
‐A barrier!

43
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,569
‐All right, we’re going in.

44
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,866
‐Hey, pretty good job, Shippo.

45
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,623
The ribbon’s a nice touch.

46
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,787
Give it a rest.

47
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,876
Oh no!

48
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,749
He’s coming for us!

49
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:13,586
Oh!

50
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,750
‐Don’t run away!

51
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,340
‐I’m still just a kid, you know.

52
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,256
‐Aim for his legs and maybe
we can stop him from moving.

53
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,559
‐Kilala.

54
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,020
Dive under his belly and‐‐ Huh?

55
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,652
This is hardly the time.

56
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:31,941
You’re depraved!

57
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:32,982
MIROKU: I couldn’t help myself.

58
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,606
SANGO: Keep your
hands to yourself.

59
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,901
‐Argh.

60
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,614
What the hell do they think
they’re doing out there?

61
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:38,736
I can’t stand it anymore.

62
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,450
‐No.

63
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,699
Wait!

64
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:41,741
You mustn’t go out, Master Inu‐‐

65
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:42,873
‐Shut up.

66
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,869
‐Smushed again.

67
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,831
‐Huh?

68
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:46,492
Kagome!

69
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,463
‐Inuyasha.

70
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,586
Inuyasha!

71
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,862
‐Look down there.

72
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,283
‐The moonless night is ending.

73
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,650
‐He made it.

74
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,326
‐Sorry to keep you
waiting, Naraku.

75
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,041
[music playing]

76
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,666
‐I’m the one you
really wanna fight!

77
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,425
‐Now, Lord Inuyasha!

78
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,855
Use the Tetsusaiga
to break the barrier.

79
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:52,855
‐Right.

80
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,978
‐Now, if you’ll excuse me.

81
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,488
‐The barrier is disappearing.

82
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:07,986
‐Yeah.

83
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,413
I knew Inuyasha could do it.

84
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,947
‐Miroku.

85
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,458
Take the right.

86
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,370
‐Consider it done.

87
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:32,887
‐Inuyasha!

88
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:33,888
‐Kagome.

89
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,899
Where’s the jewel
shard on his body?

90
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,612
‐Just a sec.

91
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,902
On his back.

92
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:40,573
‐Gotcha.

93
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:45,066
Die!

94
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:05,626
‐Inuyasha!

95
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,589
‐Stay out of the way.

96
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,599
‐Hey, watch it!

97
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:10,561
NARAKU: Inuyasha.

98
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,469
Become one with my body.

99
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:16,194
‐Inuyasha!

100
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,452
‐My sacred suture didn’t
work on him either.

101
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,128
‐Get your filthy body off of me!

102
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:52,508
‐Keep moving or you’ll wind
up getting caught again.

103
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,139
‐I know that.

104
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,071
‐Try as you might, your
attempts are in vain.

105
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,440
‐Says you.

106
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,487
I’ll hack you into
pieces sooner or later.

107
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,163
‐Sango!

108
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,752
‐Wretched fools.

109
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,964
‐Prepare to die, Naraku.

110
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:23,634
Wind Scar!

111
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,665
‐It’s over, Naraku!

112
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,382
‐I can feel my heart
beating in my chest again.

113
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,718
‐Naraku.

114
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:13,474
He’s dead.

115
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,722
‐My sister, Sango.

116
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:29,075
‐Did we do it?

117
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,904
‐Did we finally defeat Naraku?

118
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,996
Hey, what’s wrong, Miroku?

119
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:48,748
‐Shippo.

120
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:49,008
‐Hm?

121
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:49,669
‐Look.

122
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,175
Take a good look, Shippo.

123
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,432
‐Huh?

124
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,426
‐Miroku’s Wind Tunnel
has disappeared.

125
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,291
‐Kanna, What exactly
do you expect

126
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,789
to find in a place like this?

127
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:27,838
‐Kagura, what is
it that you wish?

128
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,631
‐I thought would be obvious.

129
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:35,433
Freedom, for I am
the wind itself.

130
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,090
Hm?

131
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,928
Kanna?

132
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:44,144
‐Your wish will come true.

133
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,477
‐Don’t you understand?

134
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:49,322
I have my freedom now
that Naraku’s dead.

135
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:52,492
Hm.

136
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,213
‐I’m at a loss.

137
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,384
How ever do I get to Mount Fuji?

138
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,213
It’s so dark, I don’t
know which way to go.

139
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,259
[sigh]

140
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,340
‐Huh?

141
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,796
KAGOME: This feels great.

142
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:25,428
It’s been ages since
we relaxed like this.

143
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,024
SANGO: Kagome.

144
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,017
‐Hm?

145
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,027
SANGO: What do you plan to
do now that Naraku is dead?

146
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,861
‐Don’t know.

147
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,114
Well, I guess I still have
to look for the sacred jewel

148
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,067
shards.

149
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,415
Remember, we didn’t find
the shards that Naraku has.

150
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,210
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): When
all the shards are found,

151
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,921
what will I do?

152
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,542
What reason will I have
for returning here?

153
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:05,558
KAGOME: Sango.

154
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,733
‐Huh?

155
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,349
KAGOME: We have to look for
your brother, Kohaku, too.

156
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,728
‐With Naraku gone, I
wonder how he’s doing.

157
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:14,436
‐Don’t worry.

158
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,567
He’ll be fine.

159
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,952
If we keep searching
for the jewel shards,

160
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,911
we’re sure to find
Kohaku sooner or later.

161
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:20,661
‐That’s right.

162
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,910
We’ll all help
you, don’t forget.

163
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,582
‐I appreciate that.

164
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:28,462
‐Oh.

165
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,251
Young maidens.

166
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,957
Celestial maidens bathing.

167
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:35,418
‐Excuse me.

168
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,756
You there, sir.

169
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,760
‐Who’s there?

170
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,011
‐Would you care to explain
what you are doing here?

171
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,136
‐Give it a rest, Miroku.

172
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,847
Can’t we even bathe in private?

173
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:49,895
‐You have it wrong.

174
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,098
s only standing guard
to protect you from danger.

175
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,558
Nothing more.

176
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,108
SANGO: The only protection
we need is against you!

177
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:56,484
‐Wait, Sango!

178
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,449
Don’t be rash!

179
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,449
‐What was that?

180
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,071
‐Inuyasha, you pervert!

181
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,367
Sit!

182
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,291
INUYASHA: I was
just trying to help.

183
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,290
KAGOME: Yeah, right!

184
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:09,293
Help yourself to a peek!

185
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,584
‐Thank goodness I was spared.

186
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,045
INUYASHA: Like
I’d wanna see you.

187
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,299
‐A mirror?

188
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,968
‐To meet nevermore.

189
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:32,347
Tears of sorrow overflow
deep within my heart.

190
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,438
What good, this potion of life?

191
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,482
All is but dust in the wind.

192
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:56,134
‐So, Naraku has died.

193
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:01,090
Now all living creatures in
this world must be eliminated,

194
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,014
and eternal night shall be mine.

195
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,345
‐Who are you?

196
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,428
Name yourself.

197
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:10,142
‐I am the princess of
the heavens, Kaguya.

198
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,827
Behold.

199
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:36,584
The dream castle of
the pentacle mirrors.

200
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:42,759
Kagura, your freedom is
but a fleeting illusion.

201
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,382
‐Heh.

202
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:44,378
So what if it is?

203
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:45,837
What about it?

204
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:49,637
‐I shall show you
everlasting freedom.

205
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,562
I know your true wish,
and I can grant it.

206
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,771
WOMAN: Something for us
to do to pass the time.

207
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,909
TEACHER: TO meet nevermore.

208
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,207
Tears of sorrow overflow
deep within my heart.

209
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,292
What good, this potion of life?

210
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,760
All is but dust in the wind.

211
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,880
This is the verse
composed by the emperor.

212
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,467
I will never see
Princess Kaguya again.

213
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,934
The tears of sadness
overflow and set

214
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,933
me adrift on a
sea of loneliness.

215
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,595
What good would the
potion of immortality be?

216
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,686
I have no use for it now.

217
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,900
That, class, is what he
was trying to express.

218
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,942
The emperor orders
his vassals to take

219
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,775
the potion of immortality
to Tsuruga, to the tallest

220
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,912
mountain in Japan, and burn it.

221
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,779
At that time, the
mountain was called

222
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,616
the Mountain of
Immortality, or Fushi,

223
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,203
from which the name
Mount Fuji derived.

224
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,658
That’s all for today.

225
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,789
Remember, class.

226
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,464
Your reports on the tale
of the bamboo cutter

227
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:00,544
are due next week.

228
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,036
GIRL: Kagome.

229
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,048
Kagome.

230
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,009
Class is over.

231
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,591
GIRL: All rise.

232
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,925
Thank you, Ms. Yamada.

233
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:13,645
KAGOME: More homework.

234
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:14,813
Just what I didn’t need.

235
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:18,597
‐We’re in junior high.

236
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,565
Why do we have to write a
report about a dumb fairytale?

237
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,607
‐Then again, the
author Murasaki Shikibu

238
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,652
wrote that Tale of
the Bamboo Cutter

239
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,946
is the forerunner of all novels.

240
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,700
‐So it’s like a
classic of classics.

241
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,084
‐Hey, what do you think
of Princess Kaguya?

242
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,700
She finds suitors
who wanna marry her,

243
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,828
then gives them super hard
tasks to prove their love.

244
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,505
In the end, she dumps them all.

245
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,175
Even the emperor gets dissed.

246
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,591
Then she goes back to the
moon and doesn’t marry anyone.

247
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,880
KAGOME (VOICEOVER):
That’s right.

248
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,835
Princess Kaguya went back to
the moon and never returned.

249
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,586
I wonder how long
I’ll be able to keep

250
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,507
traveling between the
two dimensions of time?

251
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,719
‐Hey, speaking of
suitors, your guy

252
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,309
sure likes to woo you with
all kinds of presents.

253
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,693
‐Huh?

254
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,481
‐Well, I wonder what you’re
in for today, Kagome?

255
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,694
[bell ringing]

256
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,364
‐Kagome, over here!

257
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,232
‐Oh, look.

258
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,070
Speak of the devil.

259
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,703
‐You’re getting healthy.

260
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,952
You’ve been at
school a lot lately.

261
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,493
‐Yeah, feeling
better all the time.

262
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,577
‐Drink this.

263
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,623
It’ll build up your
strength even more.

264
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,205
‐Gee, thanks.

265
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,209
‐I was wondering
about this Sunday.

266
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,586
Are you free?

267
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,133
How about going to the fair?

268
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,716
And this time, you
better not cancel on me.

269
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:35,601
SOTA: Sis!

270
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,511
‐Huh?

271
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,807
‐You got a sec?

272
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,560
‐Sota, what’s the matter?

273
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:40,484
‐It’s Inuyasha.

274
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,690
He’s‐‐

275
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,649
‐Is something wrong?

276
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,769
‐Naw, not reality.

277
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,357
See you later.

278
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,159
[barking]

279
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,253
‐Now, what about Inuyasha?

280
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,461
‐Well, he was at the house
until a little while ago,

281
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,344
but he’s disappeared.

282
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,709
‐Why weren’t you watching him?

283
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,625
You weren’t supposed to
let him out of the house.

284
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,415
He’s bound to attract all kinds
of unwanted attention dressed

285
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,300
up in that gaudy red outfit.

286
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,297
‐Sorry, I couldn’t help it.

287
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,639
‐Would you mutts be quiet?

288
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,643
Sit!

289
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,644
[thud]

290
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,385
‐Hm?

291
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,434
‐Huh?

292
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,188
‐Inuyasha.

293
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,189
What are you doing here?

294
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,071
‐What are you talking
about, Kagome?

295
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,319
You took so long getting
back, so I came for you!

296
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,703
BOY: He’s got long white
hair, and horns, too!

297
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,399
INUYASHA: Hey!

298
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:34,698
What are you doing?

299
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:35,656
GIRL: I heard it was a man.

300
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,741
KAGOME: Hiding.

301
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,534
Or at least trying to.

302
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:38,832
GIRL: And then the man
took the boy’s candy.

303
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:39,621
INUYASHA: Ha ha.

304
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:40,544
Very funny.

305
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,448
‐I thought the girl was
gonna give him chocolate.

306
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,750
‐So what took you so long?

307
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,751
‐I want to spend time here.

308
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,753
Is that such a big deal?

309
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,794
‐We ain’t got the time.

310
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,668
We have to go find the
sacred jewel shards.

311
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,795
Got it?

312
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,670
Besides, let me
remind you that it’s

313
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,801
your fault that the jewel
shattered in the first place.

314
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:55,844
‐I know that!

315
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,588
‐No you don’t!

316
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,888
‐Nonstop fighting.

317
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,971
It never changes.

318
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,717
‐Once we’ve got
all the shards, you

319
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,348
can come back here
any time you want.

320
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:04,887
‐Oh, gee.

321
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:05,517
How very kind of you.

322
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,115
You can’t do a thing without me.

323
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,819
INUYASHA: What are
you talking about?

324
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,611
‐How about some precious
memories of how dumb

325
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,153
you two look?

326
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:17,526
INUYASHA: What was that?

327
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:18,697
Get down, Kagome!

328
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,624
‐KAGOME: Stop it!

329
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,791
INUYASHA: Iron
Reaver Soul Stealer!

330
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,580
KAGOME: Knock it off!

331
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,374
‐There they go again,
making a scene.

332
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,234
‐Not finished?

333
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,526
That’s the crystal
from the dragon’s neck?

334
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,889
‐Interesting.

335
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,859
A demonic aura has
replaced Naraku’s.

336
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,109
I will discover whose.

337
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,990
FIVE LAKES OF FUJI
LAKE YAMANAKA

338
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:49,246
‐Oh, arrow of mine, with
power pure and immense

339
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:53,043
to slay the dragon, do you
a good deed fast and swift.

340
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,537
Grasp the crystal in its neck.

341
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,391
FIVE LAKES OF FUJI
LAKE SHOJI

342
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,930
KANNA: I ventured to see if
what I had heard was true.

343
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,105
But this jeweled
sprig with leaves

344
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,645
so real twas nothing more
than an empty promise.

345
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:17,986
‐Three more, [inaudible].

346
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,030
‐Which one should
we go after next?

347
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:23,622
‐He who wears cloth woven
from the fur of the fire rat.

348
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,239
Inuyasha.

349
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:24,665
‐Fine.

350
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,578
INUYASHA: What are you doing?

351
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,286
‐Might as well keep these
pictures of us together.

352
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,839
Look.

353
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:38,303
‐Hm.

354
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:41,631
‐There.

355
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,507
It’s all done.

356
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:46,891
Here.

357
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:47,932
‐What’s this for?

358
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:48,885
‐A locket.

359
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,644
Promise you’ll
never take it off.

360
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,136
‐Yeah?

361
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:51,978
How come?

362
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,898
‐Uh‐‐ Cause it’ll grant
your wishes, for one thing.

363
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:56,651
‐Right.

364
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,772
‐Oh, yeah.

365
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,188
Believe me, it works much
better than the sacred jewel.

366
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,949
‐Liar.

367
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,949
I wouldn’t be caught dead
with a thing like this.

368
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,821
‐What’s wrong with it?

369
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:06,488
Hmph!

370
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,535
You are a jerk.

371
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:09,871
‐Huh?

372
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:10,615
What did you say?

373
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:10,834
Huh?

374
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,923
‐What’s wrong?

375
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,039
Inuyasha?

376
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,167
‐That scent‐‐ it couldn’t be!

377
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,464
‐Now where are you off to?

378
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,418
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
This is Naraku’s scent.

379
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:23,678
I’m positive.

380
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:24,381
He’s still alive.

381
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,873
‐Inuyasha, here at last.

382
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:47,701
‐Huh.

383
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:48,745
You again, Kagura.

384
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,539
You’re here to avenge
Naraku’s death, I assume?

385
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:52,791
‐Naraku?

386
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,042
Ah, yes.

387
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,874
How soon we forget
those we detest.

388
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,590
Well, he’s out of my life now!

389
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,553
‐Then why the visit?

390
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:04,884
‐Inuyasha!

391
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,007
‐Dance of Blades!

392
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,138
‐Kagura!

393
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,472
‐Dance of the Dragon!

394
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:24,361
‐Inuyasha!

395
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:24,785
‐Stay away!

396
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,041
‐The cloth of the fire rat.

397
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,291
Now I have it.

398
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,294
‐What?

399
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:36,745
Huh?

400
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,088
KAGOME: A full moon?

401
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:52,062
KAGUYA: the white hot flames
of my love for you cannot burn

402
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,099
this cloth of fur.

403
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:58,482
My raiment, sleeves dried of
tears, now on this day I dawn.

404
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:07,033
‐What’s that?

405
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,662
[laughter]

406
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:09,611
‐Who’s there?

407
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,530
Show yourself!

408
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,946
‐My name is Kaguya.

409
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:17,037
I am the ruler of eternal night.

410
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,252
‐Kaguya, is it?

411
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,918
What do you want with me?

412
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:24,464
‐Inuyasha!

413
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,086
‐Get back!

414
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,803
I don’t like it.

415
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,973
She’s dangerous.

416
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,803
‐I can see your desires.

417
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:36,100
Your very deepest desires.

418
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:39,733
Your true self, where
your dark heart rules.

419
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,522
You’re but a despicable beast.

420
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,477
[growl]

421
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:48,526
‐Quit your jabbering and
come on out of that mirror.

422
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:49,154
Wind Scar!

423
00:24:58,664 --> 00:24:59,254
What happened?

424
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:04,087
Huh.

425
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,339
Fine, then.

426
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:10,182
I’ll just have to stick it
to you right in the heart.

427
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,549
‐Dance of the Dragon!

428
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:12,297
‐Backlash Wave!

429
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:19,644
‐What?

430
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,097
Kanna!

431
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,266
KAGUYA: The fool.

432
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:28,533
‐What’s that?

433
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:34,486
Huh?

434
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,470
[scream]

435
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:52,931
‐Sit!

436
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,098
[laughter]

437
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,385
‐Inuyasha, how
pathetic you’ve become.

438
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:04,398
Requiring the
protection of a mortal?

439
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:17,332
‐Inuyasha!

440
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:24,287
Inuyasha!

441
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:29,207
Inuyasha!

442
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,840
Inuyasha!

443
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,216
KAGUYA: Is it the fate of
man to live with these fears

444
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,433
all their lives?

445
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:42,394
That girl‐‐ the flow of time
is different around her.

446
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:45,016
‐Sure you just
wanna let them go?

447
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,404
KAGUYA: I have what I came for.

448
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,283
FIVE LAKES OF FUJI
LAKE MOTOSU

449
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:04,160
Could you have but known that
it would burn so swiftly,

450
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,579
this raiment of fur,
you would not, then,

451
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,787
have sat with such
little show of concern.

452
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,282
‐So you defeated Naraku.

453
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:43,581
‐Yes.

454
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,332
‐Your late father
and grandfather

455
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:48,834
must be proud up in the heavens.

456
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,839
‐I hope so.

457
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,591
‐Now what, my son?

458
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,261
What will you do
from this point on?

459
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,510
‐Now that I have
defeated my arch enemy,

460
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,354
there is only one more
duty that I desperately

461
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:01,809
need to take care of.

462
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,849
To ease the hearts of
the beauties scattered

463
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:06,944
throughout this land, and
with my body and mind,

464
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:14,899
I will‐‐ Sango isn’t here.

465
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,187
What am I thinking?

466
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,360
‐What ails you?

467
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,487
‐It’s a woman,
whose jealous wrath

468
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:22,243
seems to haunt my every thought.

469
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,867
Will I ever recover
from this fear, monk?

470
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,374
[laughter]

471
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:26,914
‐Come, my boy.

472
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,919
Let me read your palm.

473
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:30,382
Hm.

474
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,672
Oh, dear.

475
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:38,885
You have only
three days to live.

476
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,389
‐Only three days?

477
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:44,971
‐Actually, I’m only kidding you.

478
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,267
I have something
for you, Miroku.

479
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,772
Your grandfather,
the monk Miyatsu,

480
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,405
left this last
testament with me.

481
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,412
I was told to give it to the
descendent who defeated Naraku.

482
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:31,267
‐I wonder what everyone’s
doing right now?

483
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:32,853
You know what?

484
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:36,188
I think we should
hurry home, Kilala.

485
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,235
[hiss]

486
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,647
‐What’s wrong?

487
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,698
Kilala!

488
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,530
[grunting]

489
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,420
‐Give us the sacred jewel shard!

490
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:07,595
[scream]

491
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,900
‐Looks mighty tender,
that human flesh.

492
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,446
‐I’ll devour his thighs.

493
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,949
‐And I, his eyeballs.

494
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:32,827
‐Kohaku!

495
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:10,156
‐My lady.

496
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,122
‐Tell me, what happened here?

497
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:19,167
‐Many demons came, and the
villagers were all slain.

498
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,132
‐Demons?

499
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,843
‐Take this.

500
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:25,683
The head priest entrusted
me to protect it.

501
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:33,096
The stone bowl of Buddha.

502
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,525
Guard it well.

503
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,441
It’s what they want.

504
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,441
‐Are you sure you
want to give it to me?

505
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:44,244
Can you be sure that
I too am not a demon?

506
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:46,241
‐You’re no demon.

507
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:48,243
And you’re not evil.

508
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:48,663
I can‐‐

509
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:07,595
SHIPPO: Inuyasha,
are we just gonna

510
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:11,636
leave without Miroku and Sango?

511
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,683
‐So, where do you
sense the jewel shard?

512
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,595
‐I don’t know about this.

513
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,885
You’re still too wounded
to be up and around.

514
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:19,728
‐Quit talking, and get pointing.

515
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,733
‐I see what’s going on here.

516
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:23,615
If I’m not mistaken,
you’re still

517
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,442
angry cause you lost to Kagura.

518
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:27,109
Who’s asking for your opinion?

519
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:27,605
‐See?

520
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,317
What did I tell ya?

521
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,618
You’re gonna explode.

522
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,990
INUYASHA: I told
you to keep quiet!

523
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:33,828
[smack]

524
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:34,452
[scream]

525
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:35,536
‐Oh, I knew it!

526
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,540
You are angry!

527
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,411
‐Inuyasha!

528
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,667
‐Hmph.

529
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,171
HOJO: What do you want with me?

530
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,883
‐Do I have to spell it out?

531
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,211
Leave all your
belongings, and go.

532
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,877
‐I am on an important
mission, my good men.

533
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,626
Can’t you steal
from someone else?

534
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,759
‐When we’re done with you‐‐

535
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,264
‐Step aside, ladies.

536
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:52,635
‐Hey.

537
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,314
Hold it.

538
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,982
How dare you pass by without
bowing your head in respect!

539
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:01,694
‐That’s not wise.

540
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,363
Inuyasha’s in a bad mood today.

541
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:05,403
‐Don’t make me laugh.

542
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:06,654
You want to see a bad mood?

543
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,495
I’ll show you a bad mood.

544
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,530
‐I’m serious, you guys.

545
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,494
Better apologize while
you have the chance.

546
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,625
INUYASHA: Too late.

547
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,330
‐You want trouble?

548
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,620
You got it!

549
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:25,843
‐Thank you for
coming to my rescue.

550
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,170
I am truly in your debt.

551
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,088
‐Huh?

552
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,547
It’s Hojo.

553
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,008
‐Hm?

554
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,217
‐Hojo is my name.

555
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,559
Akitoki Hojo.

556
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:42,733
KAGOME (VOICEOVER):
Could he be an ancestor?

557
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,984
‐Here’s a small token
of my appreciation.

558
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,686
‐Thank you.

559
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,607
‐It’s quite tasty,
and it’s good for you.

560
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,574
Please try it.

561
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,315
KAGOME (VOICEOVER):
A health nut.

562
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,613
Now I’m positive
he’s an ancestor.

563
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,198
‐Oranges, anyone?

564
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:56,834
Oh!

565
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:03,619
‐This is beautiful.

566
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,538
What is it?

567
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,878
‐Ah, our precious
family heirloom.

568
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,302
‐Well, what you
mean, your heirloom?

569
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:12,381
‐It’s the Hojo family
heirloom, the celestial robe.

570
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:15,846
‐Celestial robe?

571
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,639
As in the famous one?

572
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,772
‐Exactly.

573
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,890
Now, if you’ll excuse
me, I’m in a hurry.

574
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,847
Farewell, and thank you again.

575
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:28,899
‐What an idiot.

576
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:30,904
He’ll never survive
in these times.

577
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:34,572
MIROKU: Help yourself.

578
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:35,658
‐How kind.

579
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,820
Thank you.

580
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,788
‐The full moon has not
waned in a long time.

581
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,081
‐Don’t I know it?

582
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,924
My friends have been up
partying every night.

583
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,420
‐This very same phenomenon
occurred 50 years ago, too.

584
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,214
‐Oh, you don’t say?

585
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:51,756
MIROKU: The grandfather,
the head monk Miyatsu,

586
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,300
put a spell on an
evil demon that

587
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:56,685
made the full moon
appear night after night.

588
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,391
‐You’re talking about
Naraku, I suppose?

589
00:34:59,472 --> 00:34:59,722
‐No.

590
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,556
He’s dead.

591
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,062
‐But not missed.

592
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:06,654
Doesn’t his death mean the
wind tunnel in your right palm

593
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,191
is gone?

594
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:08,653
‐Yes.

595
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,443
It does.

596
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,447
I’ve been thinking,
Hachi, about going

597
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:16,782
to my grandfather’s grave.

598
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,496
[sigh]

599
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,621
‐Is that why you summoned me?

600
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:26,288
What’s the problem?

601
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:30,594
It’s not like the nightly
full moon bothers anyone.

602
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,550
‐Grandfather Miyatsu
wrote in his will,

603
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:36,052
she stops time without
care or remorse,

604
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,934
and destroys all living beings.

605
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,772
So you will come along
with me, won’t you, Hachi?

606
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,521
‐Why take this raccoon dog?

607
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,695
What use would he be?

608
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,863
‐Rest assured, Master Mushin,
Hachi has unquestioned loyalty.

609
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:55,651
‐Huh.

610
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,407
Yeah, as if.

611
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:01,199
Who’d take on such a
dangerous job, anyway?

612
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:04,116
‐Are you saying, then, you
will not heed my request?

613
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:04,834
‐Ha!

614
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,043
Why should I be scared of you?

615
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,374
You’ve got no wind tunnel!

616
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,170
‐Hm.

617
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,802
Let’s take a short
walk, shall we?

618
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,760
We’ll be right back.

619
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:15,969
Won’t be long.

620
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:18,509
‐Go east on him, now.

621
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:19,225
‐What’s the matter?

622
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:19,844
Come.

623
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,849
‐Doesn’t know what he’s in for.

624
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:26,684
MIROKU: You ingrate!

625
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,020
I’ve been good to you, demon!

626
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:31,314
A simple favor
That’s all I asked!

627
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:34,148
Hachi has kindly
agreed to accompany me.

628
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:34,784
‐Excellent.

629
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,569
A safe journey to you both.

630
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,535
‐Come.

631
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:39,413
Yes, sir.

632
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,411
Give the word, and I
shall lead the way.

633
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,393
‐Another full moon?

634
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:04,393
How could that be?

635
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:24,743
Huh?

636
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:25,696
What’s this?

637
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,825
[groan]

638
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:29,833
‐Huh?

639
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,294
‐Kohaku?

640
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:33,329
‐Uh‐‐

641
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:37,509
‐You feel well enough to get up?

642
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:43,967
‐Where am I?

643
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,715
‐The Village of
the Demon Slayers.

644
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,925
Our village.

645
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:48,636
‐Our village?

646
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,109
‐Kohaku, you still
don’t remember

647
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,940
much about what
happened, do you?

648
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,865
‐I’m sorry, Miss Sango.

649
00:37:58,943 --> 00:37:59,363
‐Huh?

650
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:03,911
It’s OK.

651
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,620
No need to be sorry.

652
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,054
‐Huh?

653
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,959
SANGO (VOICEOVER):
Naraku is dead, yet

654
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,919
you’re still not
freed from his grasp.

655
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:30,931
You’re still tormented
by the painful memory

656
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,307
of killing Father
and the others.

657
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,208
‐Sister?

658
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,884
‐Huh?

659
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,802
Kohaku?

660
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:00,709
What did you say?

661
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:07,426
‐Sometimes that word will
suddenly come back to me.

662
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:11,602
And the pain comes.

663
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:15,563
Like my heart is being crushed.

664
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,097
‐It’s OK.

665
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,018
Don’t try too hard.

666
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,689
The memories will
come to you in time.

667
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:36,118
Kilala?

668
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,552
[hiss]

669
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:44,053
‐Kagura!

670
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,351
Leave him alone.

671
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:52,559
He’s not going with you again.

672
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,230
‐All I want is the
swallow’s cowrie shell

673
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,390
he possesses, nothing more.

674
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:00,019
We were both freed from Naraku’s
hold, so let’s be friends,

675
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,856
shall we?

676
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:07,612
Hand it over without quarrel,
and I’ll spare your life.

677
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,239
‐Kohaku, get my Hiraikotsu.

678
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:09,744
‐Kay.

679
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:12,866
‐Dance of the Dragon!

680
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:13,792
‐Get inside!

681
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,746
[screaming]

682
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:23,209
‐Kohaku!

683
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,975
‐Thanks for the gift.

684
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,595
[scream]

685
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,196
‐How’s your leg?

686
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,199
‐Never mind me.

687
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,120
What about the shell?

688
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:51,909
‐What is it?

689
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,661
This shell?

690
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,125
‐I guard it.

691
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,003
If it gets into their hands‐‐

692
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,541
SANGO: What will happen?

693
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:00,753
KOHAKU: The spell
will be broken.

694
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:08,802
‐Master Miroku?

695
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:14,643
This gave‐‐ is this the one?

696
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:15,642
‐Yes.

697
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,933
It’s the grave of my
grandfather, Monk Miyatsu.

698
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:19,638
‐Excuse me.

699
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:20,139
You there?

700
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,230
Tell me, monk.

701
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,605
Did you know Master Miyatsu?

702
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,782
FIVE LAKES OF FUJI
LAKE SAI

703
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:39,961
‐Time has passed
swiftly as I have

704
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,419
waited to see the
shell you promised.

705
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,539
They say that I wait in vain.

706
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,128
Could this be so?

707
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:53,966
‐One more object remains‐‐
the stone bowl of Buddha.

708
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:57,143
[laughter]

709
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,194
‐Think there’ll be
another full moon tonight?

710
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:12,819
‐Well, works just fine for me.

711
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,043
‐Spectacular!

712
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,699
I’ve never tasted
anything so delicious.

713
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:24,248
‐So, tell me, Hojo,
Which way are you headed?

714
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:28,545
‐I cannot reveal that to
a stranger such as you.

715
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,051
Ah?

716
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:32,631
I’m on my way to Mount Fuji to
throw the robe into the crater.

717
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,307
‐Throw what robe?

718
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,849
You don’t mean the
celestial robe, do you?

719
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,983
‐Exactly.

720
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:47,191
The robe was entrusted to the
Hojo family generations ago.

721
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:50,113
It previously belong to an
immortal celestial being,

722
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,154
they say.

723
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:55,034
Since then, we have cherished
it as our family treasure,

724
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,244
until one day a
very high ranking

725
00:42:57,325 --> 00:43:00,295
monk came with this warning.

726
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,711
When the full moon shines
for many, many nights,

727
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:07,790
throw the robe into the mouth
of the Mount Fuji crater,

728
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:12,839
otherwise great calamity
will fall upon the land.

729
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:16,304
And these past several nights,
the moon has been full.

730
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:20,177
The monk’s prediction
has come true.

731
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,984
The robe must be destroyed
as soon as possible.

732
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:24,061
INUYASHA: What a story.

733
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,143
‐Huh?

734
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,769
‐If what the monk
said is actually true,

735
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,395
what kind of calamity
is supposed to happen?

736
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:32,483
‐I don’t really know.

737
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,780
Ah.

738
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:35,994
‐That’s right.

739
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:37,324
The moon and the celestial robe.

740
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,408
It’s the story of
Princess Kaguya.

741
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:41,622
Under the light
of the full moon,

742
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:44,254
celestial maidens came for her
and dressed her in her robe.

743
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,330
‐Did you say Kaguya?

744
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,247
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
She did reek of disaster.

745
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,844
That much I’m sure of.

746
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:08,309
‐The dead priestess who lives
off the souls of the departed.

747
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:09,896
You’re looking gloomy as usual.

748
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:22,532
‐Answer me, is this
all Naraku’s doing?

749
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,830
‐Are you still worried
about that rotting corpse?

750
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:27,616
‐He’s dead?

751
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,013
What’s the matter?

752
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:43,468
Won’t you accept it?

753
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:45,016
It’s what you seek, is it not?

754
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:52,364
‐You’re very
generous about this.

755
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:53,481
‐I’m not like you.

756
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:11,753
‐Such a creepy woman.

757
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:15,206
But I am indebted
to her, for now I

758
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:17,088
have my last sacred object.

759
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,475
And for that, I am grateful.

760
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,389
‐There is a
terrifying legend that

761
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:33,558
has been passed down
in this village.

762
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:37,229
One day, a heavenly being
was beating in a spring

763
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:38,738
by the village.

764
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:42,409
A man who saw her stole
the celestial robe

765
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:45,161
she had left hanging
on a tree branch.

766
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:45,993
‐Oh, yes.

767
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:48,367
I know that story, old man.

768
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,414
The man who stole the robe
and the celestial maiden

769
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:51,708
were married.

770
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:54,591
‐The story in the
village is different.

771
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:57,339
The being whose
robe was stolen grew

772
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:01,301
mad with fury, and
consequently slew one innocent

773
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,925
villager after another.

774
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:10,598
By a stroke of luck, monk
Miyatsu came upon this village

775
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:13,266
and sealed the maiden
inside a mirror

776
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:15,774
known as the Mirror of Life.

777
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,978
‐I can’t help but wonder if she
was indeed a celestial being,

778
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:22,280
or was she merely a
demon disguised as one?

779
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:23,665
‐I do not know.

780
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:28,581
But I’ve heard that the robe
stolen by the man was genuine.

781
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:33,461
HACHI: Does this celestial robe
still exist in this village?

782
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:37,801
MAN: No one knows
where it is now.

783
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,920
‐What about the Mirror of Life
in which the maiden was sealed?

784
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:45,638
‐It was placed on the
altar with a divine sprig

785
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,310
in the Forest of
Illusion, at the Shrine

786
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,639
of the Mirror of Life.

787
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,515
FIVE LAKES OF FUJI
LAKE KAWAGUCHI

788
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:08,576
FEMALE VOICE: I hope to find
the gleam of the fallen dew,

789
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,539
but nothing can I see.

790
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,791
Why did you go yonder
to Mount Ogura?

791
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:43,445
‐The moon is truly
beautiful when

792
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,237
seen through the eyes
of a physical body.

793
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:47,324
‐I’ve kept my promise.

794
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:51,203
Now let me have this true
freedom you speak of, Kaguya.

795
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,035
‐Not. yet.

796
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:54,621
‐Hm?

797
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,665
‐There is one more
thing I require of you.

798
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:08,301
‐Hey, here it is here.

799
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:11,556
The book says that Princess
Kaguya made all her suitors

800
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,810
undertake rigorous
tasks, and there’s

801
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,851
mention of cloth
from a fire rat.

802
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:16,395
‐Hm?

803
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:17,477
‐You see?

804
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:20,692
It shows the jeweled sprig, the
crystal from the dragon’s neck,

805
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:24,323
the stone bowl of Buddha,
the swallow’s cowrie shell,

806
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,572
and the cloth of the fire rat.

807
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:31,025
That’s why Kagura came
after your kimono.

808
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:34,117
‐They make a nice,
cozy twosome, huh?

809
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:36,005
‐Alas, unrequited love.

810
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,580
‐So what’s your problem?

811
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,996
Are you in love with Kagome?

812
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:43,214
‐When I first glimpsed Miss
Kagome through the steamy mist,

813
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:46,715
I thought she was a
celestial being from heaven.

814
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:47,259
‐Hm?

815
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:48,343
Ah.

816
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:49,176
I get it.

817
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,510
You were the spying pervert.

818
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:52,545
‐Hush, hush, hush!

819
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,768
Don’t ever say that aloud!

820
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:55,559
‐Hm.

821
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,480
All right, but you have to
be my servant from now on.

822
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:58,942
‐Huh?

823
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:09,946
‐You know, maybe this
Princess Kaguya in the legend

824
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,242
didn’t really want to
return to the moon.

825
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,244
‐Huh?

826
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,485
What are you talking about?

827
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,038
‐A shooting star!

828
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:16,870
Hurry, make a wish.

829
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,881
Inuyasha?

830
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:33,347
Tell me, do you still want
to become a full demon?

831
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:34,011
‐Yeah.

832
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:35,138
Of course I do.

833
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:38,102
‐You’re pretty strong
already, don’t you think?

834
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:40,064
‐Be quiet, will ya?

835
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:42,024
I’m going to become
a full fledged demon.

836
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:45,106
I’ve already made up my mind, so
just quit bugging me about it,

837
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:45,731
would ya?

838
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:50,493
‐I’ve been thinking,
there’s nothing wrong

839
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:53,413
with staying the way you are.

840
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:54,951
I mean, why not
stay a half demon?

841
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:03,667
To be honest, I like you
just the way you are.

842
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:04,751
‐That’s ridiculous.

843
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,245
‐What’s so ridiculous?

844
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:07,797
Can’t you be a little serious?

845
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:17,935
‐What is it now?

846
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:18,925
‐Inuyasha?

847
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,056
You just‐‐

848
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:20,934
‐Come on.

849
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:21,688
Spit it out.

850
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:25,522
‐Hey.

851
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:26,356
What’s that?

852
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,610
‐Strange.

853
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,781
How can cherry blossoms
fall in this season?

854
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:31,861
‐What‐‐ what’s wrong?

855
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:44,330
KAGUYA: The time has now come.

856
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:47,786
Behold the robe from heaven
to drape upon my shoulders.

857
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:51,378
And for you, it is but a
deep sadness that I feel.

858
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:57,050
‐Thanks for saving me the
trouble of hunting you down.

859
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,890
‐Not the two of you again.

860
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:06,397
What poor luck I have to
come across such fools.

861
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:08,402
Where is the celestial robe?

862
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:11,324
‐What are you talking about?

863
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:13,322
‐There it is.

864
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:15,244
‐You ain’t gettin’ it!

865
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:21,156
[chanting]

866
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:25,708
‐What?

867
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:26,791
‐You won’t interfere.

868
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,554
‐Inuyasha!

869
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,557
‐What’s happening?

870
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:43,269
‐I wondered why
you were so weak.

871
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:44,482
Now I see.

872
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:45,982
You’re merely a half demon.

873
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:49,313
‐That a problem for ya?

874
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:49,770
‐Inuyasha!

875
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:54,613
‐Kagome!

876
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:55,277
‐Inuyasha!

877
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:01,576
‐Yes.

878
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,660
There it is.

879
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,746
The celestial robe for
which I’ve searched.

880
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:08,171
[chanting]

881
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:09,252
‐Run, you fool!

882
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,763
‐Kaguya!

883
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:18,471
‐Such impudence.

884
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:19,802
A sacred arrow.

885
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:23,806
Interesting.

886
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:25,521
‐Release Inuyasha now.

887
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:28,813
‐Get out of here, Kagome!

888
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:31,476
‐Just go ahead and try it.

889
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:33,727
‐It’s your funeral.

890
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:37,817
[chanting]

891
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,671
‐Inuyasha!

892
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,250
‐Kagome!

893
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:51,845
‐Watch out!

894
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:04,102
‐Kagome.

895
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:08,191
Kagome!

896
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:17,936
‐I’m so thankful‐‐ you’re
all right, Inuyasha.

897
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,398
‐Why did you do that?

898
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,820
Why didn’t you stay away?

899
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:23,367
‐It’s no big deal.

900
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:28,790
And besides, you’re always
saving me, aren’t you?

901
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:29,752
‐Kagome.

902
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:30,753
Kagome!

903
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,214
Kagome!

904
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,794
Kagome!

905
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,247
[laughter]

906
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:36,419
‐Damn.

907
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:37,757
Let me go, you creepy witch.

908
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:42,141
If Kagome dies, you’re gonna
regret the day you ever met me.

909
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:46,889
‐Oh, rest assured, I will
not let her die so easily.

910
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:50,734
Now, will you become my servant?

911
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:52,903
Do so, and I shall
grant you a wish.

912
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:57,232
‐You go to hell.

913
00:53:57,317 --> 00:54:00,357
Release me, that’s
all I want from you.

914
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:05,406
‐Then I’m taking the
girl along with me.

915
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:05,872
‐No!

916
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:06,911
Put her down!

917
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:08,294
Where are you taking her?

918
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,788
‐Come to my dream castle.

919
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,247
That is, if you so desire.

920
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,256
You can’t escape me for long.

921
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:28,595
Dammit!

922
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:35,938
Shippo, where’s this
dream castle of hers?

923
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:37,733
‐Wh‐‐what are you asking me for?

924
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:38,816
How should I know?

925
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,362
‐Wait.

926
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,824
There’s a saying a priest
once told my family.

927
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,196
Perhaps it can help
us find the castle.

928
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:48,912
The castle of the heavenly being
lies in the lake of Motosu,

929
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,664
unreachable by mortals.

930
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:58,714
‐So tell me, Hachi, why do you
think my grandfather didn’t

931
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:01,086
use his wind tunnel
on this Kaguya?

932
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:02,973
‐Oh, come on, isn’t it obvious?

933
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,140
Your grandfather
destroy a woman?

934
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,640
This celestial maiden was
probably a real beauty.

935
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,979
‐You don’t say?

936
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:15,101
I’m quite looking
forward to meeting her.

937
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:16,397
‐You never change.

938
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,230
Always on the prowl.

939
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,185
[laughter]

940
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:29,331
‐Whoa, is this the
cave of the shrine?

941
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:29,659
‐Hush.

942
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,663
Someone has arrived ahead of us.

943
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:44,835
‐Huh?

944
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:46,015
‐Don’t move a muscle.

945
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,980
Please, hang on, Sango!

946
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,983
‐Is that you, Miroku?

947
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:02,525
What are you doing here?

948
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,859
‐Sango?

949
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:07,115
How I longed to see you!

950
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,697
‐Miroku, come on.

951
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:09,374
What are you doing?

952
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:14,539
Stop it.

953
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:15,873
Let go!

954
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:17,166
Let go of me!

955
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:22,668
‐How my hands have
yearned for this.

956
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:25,594
[slap]

957
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:28,086
‐Ah, this pain brings
back fond memories.

958
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:31,008
It’s been far, far
too long, Sango.

959
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:34,806
‐Well, you haven’t changed
a bit, you pervert.

960
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:35,352
‐I know.

961
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:36,024
I know.

962
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:43,686
I’m glad you found
Kohaku safe and sound.

963
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,605
‐Yes.

964
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:48,865
Unfortunately, his
memory is still unclear.

965
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:50,617
‐It’s gone.

966
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:51,491
I don’t believe it.

967
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:52,995
e mirror, as well
as the jeweled sprig.

968
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,286
They’re both gone.

969
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,541
‐The swallow’s cowrie
shell is gone, as well.

970
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:59,252
Kagura came and
stole it from Kohaku.

971
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:03,003
MIROKU: This poses
a serious problem.

972
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:06,086
HACHI: Master Miroku, was
this cowrie thing also

973
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:08,883
necessary to break the spell?

974
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:09,927
‐It was.

975
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:13,299
The five treasures possessed
represent the five elements.

976
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,470
And those five elements are
wood, fire, earth, metal,

977
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,730
and water.

978
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:21,349
‐Ah‐‐ one of the five treasures
is the cost of the fire rat.

979
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:25,108
Do you think it could be the
same cloth that Inuyasha wears?

980
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,283
‐If so, we’ll meet up
with him soon enough.

981
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:40,834
‐A castle in the lake.

982
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,168
‐I can’t believe
the demonic aura.

983
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:49,126
‐Time and the full moon are
fully aligned once more.

984
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:52,137
An eternal dream, a
celebration this night.

985
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,760
And now, let it all begin.

986
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,114
‐Our fears are justified.

987
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:49,109
‐The demonic aura
is growing stronger.

988
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,742
‐She stops time without
care or remorse,

989
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:54,862
and destroys all living
things in her wake.

990
00:58:58,785 --> 00:58:59,155
‐Huh?

991
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:04,167
‐There’s a glow
beyond the forest.

992
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:05,999
Are we going, Inuyasha?

993
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:10,844
‐I don’t know about you two,
but shouldn’t we avoid danger?

994
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:13,592
‐Well, if that’s how you feel,
then stay here out of the way,

995
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:14,587
OK?

996
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:16,048
‐Inuyasha!

997
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:17,468
Akitoki, this is bad!

998
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,104
Real bad!

999
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,892
If demons accost us
now, we’ll be done for!

1000
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:22,517
‐Good point!

1001
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,317
‐Damn there, Kilala.

1002
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:25,870
Kilala!

1003
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:32,923
‐Master, we’d better be careful.

1004
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:33,344
‐Oh, no.

1005
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:36,173
Hachi, watch out!

1006
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:36,629
‐Miroku!

1007
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:37,678
No!

1008
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:39,301
[scream]

1009
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,435
‐Hachi, are you all right?

1010
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:54,483
Please, speak to me.

1011
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:54,648
Hachi!

1012
01:00:58,155 --> 01:00:59,205
Hachi!

1013
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:03,332
[snoring]

1014
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:13,127
‐Kohaku, I want you
to hang on tight, OK?

1015
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:13,751
‐Yes, Miss Sango.

1016
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:19,055
‐Look.

1017
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:19,836
There’s something in the water.

1018
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:31,098
‐Sango!

1019
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:33,018
‐Shippo!

1020
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,726
‐Kagome!

1021
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:36,438
‐Inuyasha!

1022
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:37,686
‐So you’ve shown yourself.

1023
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:42,822
INUYASHA: Kagome!

1024
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:44,448
Are you all right?

1025
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:56,552
‐Inu‐‐ Inuyasha?

1026
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,971
Inuyasha!

1027
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:01,719
‐The wound has healed.

1028
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:05,221
Such is the power of
the celestial robe.

1029
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:09,427
My wish shall be realized.

1030
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,729
‐Kagome, I’m coming to save you!

1031
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:14,901
Just hang on!
Don’t give up on me!

1032
01:02:15,023 --> 01:02:17,363
‐Inuyasha!

1033
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:23,531
‐What the‐‐

1034
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:28,792
[scream]

1035
01:02:31,957 --> 01:02:32,497
That’s a‐‐

1036
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:06,868
‐I knew I shouldn’t have
come along with you.

1037
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:23,630
‐Damn!

1038
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:36,601
Wind Scar!

1039
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:49,778
This is taking too long.

1040
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:52,578
I’ll use my Backlash Wave
and destroy it with one blow.

1041
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:03,842
I can’t use my
Backlash Wave when

1042
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:07,513
they’re coming at me
from all over the place.

1043
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:11,644
‐Now I possess limitless power.

1044
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:15,023
‐The celestial robe doesn’t
suit a fake celestial

1045
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,061
being such as you.

1046
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:40,127
‐You wouldn’t attack one
of your own, would ya?

1047
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:48,797
That blows that theory.

1048
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:56,057
Damn!

1049
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:01,809
Huh?

1050
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:05,902
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER): I get it.

1051
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,565
They’re all connected
at the base.

1052
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:09,204
If I can destroy that‐‐

1053
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:20,415
‐Watch this!

1054
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:20,880
Wind Scar!

1055
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:39,598
[scream]

1056
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:54,585
‐Who shot that arrow?

1057
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:00,675
‐Inuyasha, the rest
I shall leave to you.

1058
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:13,683
‐That’s one obstacle down.

1059
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:21,694
KAGURA: What?

1060
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,811
Have you been conquered already?

1061
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:27,567
How pitiful,
considering its size.

1062
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:31,150
That act of yours is starting
to wear just a little bit thin,

1063
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:32,609
I have to say.

1064
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:33,777
‐It’s an act?

1065
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:36,625
She’s not a real
celestial being.

1066
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,661
‐Kanna told me.

1067
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:40,625
You’re just like Naraku.

1068
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:43,285
You both consume the
flesh o other demons

1069
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:46,174
to increase your own strength.

1070
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:49,762
I’ll wager you even devoured
the real celestial maiden

1071
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:50,719
to gain immortality.

1072
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:56,677
‐Kagome!

1073
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:09,823
KAGURA: I bet Naraku must have
wanted that body of yours.

1074
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:16,279
‐I detest all these half demons.

1075
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:20,286
‐Indeed, your hatred for
them must truly run deep.

1076
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:24,710
Let me remind you, I am
a woman born of Naraku,

1077
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:28,252
and I’m growing rather
tired of your antics.

1078
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:29,668
‐You’ll confront me, then?

1079
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:32,884
That should be entertaining.

1080
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:35,377
‐How about I suck the
soul out of your body?

1081
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:44,349
[laughter]

1082
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:51,402
‐What’s the matter
with you, Kanna?

1083
01:07:51,526 --> 01:07:53,316
‐You pathetic fools.

1084
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:57,413
It’s not as easy as you
think to take my soul.

1085
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:02,750
Perhaps I should tell you why
I sought the celestial robe.

1086
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:06,749
[chanting]

1087
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:08,213
‐Power of the
Mirror of Stillness.

1088
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:22,557
‐No!

1089
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:23,930
I can’t move!

1090
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:35,151
‐Do you think that these things
will really heal injuries?

1091
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:36,858
‐Kagome’s medicine kit
contains many things

1092
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,156
with strange powers.

1093
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:41,701
‐On another note, our little
Shippo was unusually brave

1094
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:42,954
today, wasn’t he?

1095
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:45,747
I suppose he does carry his
weight from time to time.

1096
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:48,790
‐Akitoki, make sure his
bandage is good and tight.

1097
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:51,135
HOJO: Yes.

1098
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:51,842
‐Hey!

1099
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,631
It was meant as a compliment.

1100
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:55,883
‐Didn’t sound like it to me.

1101
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:59,175
Hey, Akitoki, put a
bandage on my knee.

1102
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:00,802
‐Yes, sir.

1103
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:04,467
‐Shippo, who is
this man, anyway?

1104
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:08,637
‐I do believe I’ve met you
somewhere before, haven’t I?

1105
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:10,188
‐I doubt it.

1106
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:11,113
‐Ignore him.

1107
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:12,479
He’s not worth an introduction.

1108
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:22,867
Hey, what are you doing, Miroku?

1109
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:27,872
‐Somehow I don’t feel
quite right without it.

1110
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:30,117
I guess I don’t paint
well with my left hand.

1111
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,813
KAGUYA: Ah, so he’s come.

1112
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:54,687
‐Inuyasha!

1113
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:56,194
‐He will not interfere.

1114
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:04,993
INUYASHA: Kagome!

1115
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:12,579
‐Now, you beings who exist
in the realm of time,

1116
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:15,419
vanish into the
void of illusion.

1117
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:17,135
‐Inuyasha, stay away!

1118
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,713
[shout]

1119
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,590
‐Power of the
Mirror of Stillness.

1120
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:33,559
‐Inuyasha!

1121
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:04,506
‐What’s happening?

1122
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:12,057
‐It’s Kaguya’s power of
the Mirror of Stillness.

1123
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:14,273
‐She’s making time stop.

1124
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:15,233
‐It’s coming!

1125
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:16,193
It’s coming!

1126
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:17,732
Oh, no!

1127
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:19,145
It’s all over!

1128
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,105
Father!

1129
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:24,573
I’ll be joining you
in heaven any minute.

1130
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:26,525
Huh?

1131
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:28,486
‐Nothing happened.

1132
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:29,448
‐Hey, wait.

1133
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:30,537
I don’t get it.

1134
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:33,910
Akitoki and Hachi aren’t moving.

1135
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:34,998
‐Hey, look.

1136
01:11:38,336 --> 01:11:40,126
‐Kagome’s first
aid kit is glowing.

1137
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:42,974
‐Her possessions obviously hold
a special power of their own.

1138
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:44,630
They must be able to
put up a time barrier.

1139
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:49,604
[shouting]

1140
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:54,806
‐Aw.

1141
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:57,812
These things are
making my eyes sting.

1142
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:00,607
SANGO: Don’t you think we might
have gone a little overboard?

1143
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:01,981
MIROKU: Perhaps just a little.

1144
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:07,992
[laughter]

1145
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:11,155
‐Oh, my beautiful
everlasting night, no one

1146
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:12,494
shall disrupt us again.

1147
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:16,416
‐Yeah?

1148
01:12:16,499 --> 01:12:17,789
Well, it’s not over yet.

1149
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:20,125
‐Inuyasha!

1150
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:22,251
‐Why are you still able to move?

1151
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:23,958
‐That’s the least
of your worries.

1152
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:30,605
KAGOME (VOICEOVER):
That pendant.

1153
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,390
And he said he didn’t want it.

1154
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:38,189
‐Look out, witch.

1155
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:40,021
Time for a little payback!

1156
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:50,870
What?

1157
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:52,410
[laughter]

1158
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:54,375
KAGOME: Inuyasha!

1159
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:55,035
‐Kagome!

1160
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,840
‐Inuyasha!

1161
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:04,881
Inuyasha!

1162
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:06,974
Where’d you go?

1163
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:09,089
[laughter]

1164
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:12,048
‐That unsightly
half demon was never

1165
01:13:12,138 --> 01:13:15,058
truly here in the first place.

1166
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:17,731
‐An illusion?

1167
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,100
[laughter]

1168
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,689
KAGUYA: This is the dream
of the Pentacle Mirror.

1169
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:28,073
illusion, the dream
castle beyond the mirror.

1170
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:29,864
KAGOME: Inuyasha!

1171
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:32,777
‐You’re all right.

1172
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:33,659
Where’s Kagome?

1173
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:34,663
‐Kaguya took her
into the castle.

1174
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:40,462
‐Where did the
castle disappear to?

1175
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:41,333
‐Take a look.

1176
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:52,553
‐What happened to your sleeve?

1177
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:56,967
I’ve never seen you
dress like a slob before.

1178
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:59,439
‐Why take it out on me?

1179
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:00,558
‐Well, why not?

1180
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:13,781
‐The castle’s under here.

1181
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:15,736
‐Kohaku?

1182
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:17,616
Kohaku!

1183
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:19,755
‐Let’s go.

1184
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:20,210
‐Kohaku.

1185
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:24,456
‐Kay.

1186
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:29,668
I’m just a little kid!

1187
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:30,969
It ain’t fair!

1188
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,010
Whoa!

1189
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:34,974
Hey, wait for me!

1190
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:35,426
Whoa.

1191
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:41,314
Where is everyone?

1192
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:45,901
Wait!

1193
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:47,232
Don’t leave me!

1194
01:14:55,700 --> 01:15:00,160
KAGUYA: Such fools, pursuing
me inside the mirror.

1195
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:01,997
‐Why would you wanna
stop time anyway?

1196
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:04,171
What’s the big attraction?

1197
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:06,171
‐It seems only humans
such as yourself

1198
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:09,302
are enamored by the
passage of time.

1199
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:12,590
‐I’d rather die than stay
in this hellish void.

1200
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:13,685
‐Don’t worry.

1201
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:17,179
You won’t be here for long,
for I intend to eat you.

1202
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:22,267
You possess the sacred
powers of a priesthood

1203
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,141
and can put up a
barrier against time.

1204
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:26,358
Those powers shall be mine.

1205
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:31,896
‐Kaguya!

1206
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:32,358
‐Inuyasha.

1207
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:40,912
You guys.

1208
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:42,537
You’re all OK.

1209
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:44,753
‐We are, thanks to
your medical supplies.

1210
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:50,962
‐Half demon.

1211
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:53,670
Are you prepared to
become my servant yet?

1212
01:15:53,758 --> 01:15:55,548
‐Don’t count on it.

1213
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:06,692
My sword‐‐ the Tetsusaiga!

1214
01:16:06,771 --> 01:16:07,691
‐Don’t worry.

1215
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:08,612
I’ll take care of her.

1216
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:09,571
Justice be done!

Inuyasha!

‐Fox Fire!

1225
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,534
Uh, you can take
over now, Miroku.

1226
01:17:00,908 --> 01:17:02,618
‐Take a good look, Inuyasha.

1227
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:08,291
Behold the dark spirit
that lurks in your heart.

1228
01:17:08,374 --> 01:17:10,384
‐What are you rambling on about?

1229
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:13,669
‐This is the true form
you desire to achieve,

1230
01:17:13,796 --> 01:17:17,256
and I am going to
grant your wish.

Inuyasha!

1236
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,570
‐I am the ruler of the
realm of the night.

1237
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:45,367
I possess the power of darkness.

1238
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:48,964
I shall release your true
form from the mirror.

1239
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:53,884
‐Inuyasha.

1240
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:57,463
‐Inuyasha’s transforming
into a full demon.

1241
01:17:57,548 --> 01:17:59,758
‐Yes, I see, but somehow
it’s different from before.

1242
01:17:59,842 --> 01:18:00,802
‐No, don’t!

1243
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:01,685
Don’t transform!

1244
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:10,604
‐Look at Inuyasha in the mirror.

1245
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:14,226
He seems to be transforming.

1246
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:17,146
‐This is your true
nature, Inuyasha.

1247
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:20,284
Be the full demon
you’ve longed to become.

1248
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:22,112
Seal your human
blood in this mirror

1249
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:25,368
and be true to your own wishes.

1250
01:18:25,451 --> 01:18:27,291
‐What’s going on now?

1251
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:29,329
‐If he transforms
into his full demon,

1252
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:30,253
then it’s all over for him.

1253
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:32,082
He can never be a
half demon again.

1254
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:34,128
‐You’re not serious, are you?

1255
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,710
‐But I thought
that Inuyasha could

1256
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:38,304
control the transformations
from happening.

1257
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:40,800
‐This is the world of
the mirrors, remember?

1258
01:18:40,883 --> 01:18:42,513
Perhaps the dark
desires of the heart

1259
01:18:42,593 --> 01:18:45,473
are somehow stronger in here.

1260

SHIPPO: Does that mean
he’s a ferocious beast?

1261

MIROKU: Exactly.

1262
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:54,064
‐If we break it, we
can stop the change.

1263
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:57,688
‐Sister, no!

SHIPPO: Kagome!

Don’t worry.

1268
01:19:12,206 --> 01:19:13,416
I’ll set you free.

1269
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:18,746
‐Inuyasha, snap out of it.

1270
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:21,087
You’re not going to
sell your soul to Kaguya

1271
01:19:21,215 --> 01:19:21,805
and forget about us.

1272
01:19:32,518 --> 01:19:33,228
‐Excellent.

1273
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:36,314
Only by releasing
the power of darkness

1274
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,858
can one realize true freedom.

1275
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:40,441
‐Listen to me, Kagome.

1276
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:43,147
Inuyasha is still unsure
of what he desires,

1277
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:45,949
but we can’t get through to him.

1278
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:47,531
Only you can stop him.

1279
01:19:49,994 --> 01:19:52,294
If there was ever a time I
wished I had my wind tunnel,

1280
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:52,871
it would be now.

1281
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:03,297
‐Inuyasha, don’t do it!

1282
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:04,132
Please stop!

1283
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:08,967
Shippo.

1284
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:10,474
I’ve got an idea.

1285
01:20:10,556 --> 01:20:11,846
Get my sacred jewel shards.

1286
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:13,064
‐Huh?

1287
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:14,562
‐Get my jewel shards!

1288
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:16,653
‐Right, I’ll do it!

1289
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:18,519
I want you to throw
the whole bottle at me.

1290
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:23,820
‐Here comes!

1291
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:35,001
‐Inuyasha!

Inuyasha!

1293
01:20:36,123 --> 01:20:37,173
I’m begging you.

1294
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:38,791
Please don’t change.

Inuyasha.

01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,046
‐Try what you will.

1297
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:50,178
Your efforts are in vain.

1298
01:20:50,304 --> 01:20:53,524
e human heart he possessed
is locked inside this mirror.

1299
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:57,600
He will never be a
half demon again.

1300
01:20:57,686 --> 01:21:00,186
‐Kagome, get away from him!

1301
01:21:00,314 --> 01:21:02,274
You’ll be killed.

1302
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:06,028
‐I love you as a
half demon, Inuyasha!

1303
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:08,321
To be honest, I like you
just the way you are.

1304
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:11,825
There’s nothing wrong with
staying just the way you are.

I love you as a half demon.

‐What’s the matter, Inuyasha?

1311
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:49,236
Why the hesitation?

01:22:23,981 --> 01:22:26,611
And, once you are
a full demon, bring

1319
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:28,942
me the flesh of that girl.

1320
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:31,397
KAGOME (VOICEOVER): Inuyasha,
you want to stay with me,

1321
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:31,778
don’t you?

1322
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:44,245
‐What’s happening?

1323
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:50,507
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER): Kagome.

1324
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:51,302
‐Hm?

1325
01:22:51,425 --> 01:22:54,935
What are these things?

1326
01:22:55,012 --> 01:22:55,722
‐Inuyasha.

1327
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:58,144
Are you gonna be OK now?

1328
01:22:58,265 --> 01:22:58,645
‐Kagome.

1329
01:23:05,606 --> 01:23:06,436
‐Huh?

1330
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:07,613
‐Are you nuts?

1331
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:10,441
I could’ve really hurt you.

1332
01:23:10,527 --> 01:23:13,607
I’ll stay a half demon for a
while longer, just for you.

1333
01:23:13,697 --> 01:23:15,777
‐Mm‐hm.

1334
01:23:15,866 --> 01:23:16,236
‐No.

1335
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:16,705
Stop this, Miroku.

1336
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:18,452
Don’t go getting any ideas.

1337
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:21,075
I don’t like that
look in your eye.

1338
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:21,753
‐Sango.

1339
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:26,214
‐You fool.

1340
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:28,675
How could you abandon
such a fine opportunity?

1341
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:35,177
‐Sango, come into my arms.

1342
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:35,640
‐Kohaku.

1343
01:23:35,719 --> 01:23:36,679
Are you all right?

1344
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:42,730
‐Idiot.

1345
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:51,400
‐A half demon bearing
his fangs at me?

1346
01:23:51,527 --> 01:23:52,817
You have tempted your fate.

1347
01:23:57,407 --> 01:23:57,737
‐Hm?

1348
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:05,922
‐The robe of the fire
rat is whole again.

1349
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:12,665
‐I’ve had just
about enough of you!

1350
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:22,722
What?

1351
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:29,646
So you’re no
different from Naraku.

1352
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:33,401
‐That’ll make destroying
her even easier.

1353
01:24:33,527 --> 01:24:36,647
[groaning]

1354
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:38,908
‐What’s the matter, Kohaku?

1355
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:40,911
‐My shoulder feels
like it’s burning up.

1356
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:44,202
SANGO: Huh?

1357
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:48,419
It can’t be!

1358
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:51,800
[groaning]

1359
01:24:56,675 --> 01:24:58,725
‐The wind tunnel.

1360
01:24:58,802 --> 01:25:00,722
‐Let me see.

1361
01:25:00,804 --> 01:25:01,764
Hurry, Miroku!

1362
01:25:01,847 --> 01:25:03,597
Seal it up right now!

1363
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:04,602
‐Please, sister.

1364
01:25:04,683 --> 01:25:06,683
Get away from me.

1365
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:07,138
‐Kohaku!

1366
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:13,533
‐What’s happening to him?

1367
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:14,779
Oh, no!

1368
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:18,490
‐I don’t know,
but it’s not good.

1369
01:25:18,614 --> 01:25:21,204
‐Kohaku, I’m right here.

1370
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:22,833
‐Sango‐‐

1371
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:25,701
‐Don’t worry, I’ll
never leave you again.

1372
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:27,157
[scream]

1373
01:25:35,297 --> 01:25:35,797
KAGOME: Sango!

1374
01:25:42,262 --> 01:25:43,052
‐Naraku.

1375
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:47,138
‐It’s been far too long, Kaguya.

1376
01:25:47,267 --> 01:25:47,677
‐Naraku.

1377
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:50,149
I thought you were dead.

1378
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:51,310
‐Correct.

1379
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:54,726
I was dead‐‐ just long
enough to lure you out.

1380
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:56,436
‐I don’t believe
what I’m hearing.

1381
01:25:56,526 --> 01:26:01,736
You faked your death for a while
and removed my wind tunnel?

1382
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:02,573
‐How cruel.

1383
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:04,948
How could Naraku do this to you?

1384
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:08,660
‐Inuyasha!

1385
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:12,379
Naraku intends to absorb Kaguya.

1386
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:14,711
‐No one will interfere.

1387
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:15,626
‐Hang on.

1388
01:26:15,712 --> 01:26:18,092
I’ll cut you away from Naraku.

1389
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:19,513
‐Run, Sango!

1390
01:26:19,591 --> 01:26:20,431
‐Let me go!

1391
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:21,509
Don’t do this!

1392
01:26:21,635 --> 01:26:23,895
‐You have to get away, or
Naraku will absorb you, too!

1393
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:28,426
‐Damn you.

1394
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:29,427
Damn you to hell!

1395
01:26:29,518 --> 01:26:30,438
‐Don’t do it.

1396
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:33,439
You’ll end up hurting Kohaku.

1397
01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:35,232
INUYASHA: I know that.

1398
01:26:35,357 --> 01:26:39,897
‐And now, become
one with my flesh.

1399
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:43,778
‐Keep your vile
hands away from me.

1400
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:46,905
[chanting]

1401
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:50,211
‐Huh?

1402
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:01,261
‐Kohaku!

1403
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:01,883
‐Watch out!

1404
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:08,886
[chanting]

1405
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:41,916
INUYASHA: Where’s Naraku?

1406
01:27:42,048 --> 01:27:43,878
SHIPPO: Is he dead?

1407
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:44,797
‐He’s not.

1408
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:46,216
He’s still alive.

1409
01:27:46,303 --> 01:27:48,303
‐He’s gotta be hiding
in here somewhere.

1410
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:48,930
‐Damn.

1411
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:51,274
He’s watching us
from the shadows.

1412
01:27:51,349 --> 01:27:53,889
MIROKU: If we destroy Kaguya,
he’ll consume her body

1413
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:55,347
and become immortal.

1414
01:27:55,437 --> 01:28:00,187
But if Kaguya wins,
she’ll destroy us.

1415
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:02,485
In either case, Naraku benefits.

1416
01:28:05,447 --> 01:28:08,447
He was using us right
from the very beginning.

1417
01:28:08,533 --> 01:28:10,743
‐All right, I’ve heard
just about enough.

1418
01:28:10,827 --> 01:28:11,997
‐Inuyasha?

1419
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,460
‐We’ll just kill them both
and solve the problem.

1420
01:28:14,581 --> 01:28:16,171
‐Yes.

1421
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:18,961
I can use my wind tunnel
to my heart’s content.

1422
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:21,884
‐Don’t even think
about interfering.

1423
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:24,223
Kaguya is mine!

1424
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:25,629
[shout]

1425
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:39,311
‐You cannot defeat me so easily.

1426
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:42,939
‐Listen, Shippo, transform
into a bow for me.

1427
01:28:43,026 --> 01:28:43,646
‐A bow?

1428
01:28:43,777 --> 01:28:44,937
But there’s no arrow.

1429
01:28:45,028 --> 01:28:45,948
KAGOME: Never mind.

1430
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:47,029
Just do it!

1431
01:28:51,493 --> 01:28:52,243
‐You wench!

1432
01:29:00,961 --> 01:29:01,791
‐Oh, no!

[chanting]

1434
01:29:03,797 --> 01:29:04,417
‐Look!

1435
01:29:04,506 --> 01:29:05,206
The mirror’s glowing.

1436
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:07,630
t’s the one that
sent Naraku flying.

1437
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:12,143
‐Wind tunnel!

1438
01:29:20,105 --> 01:29:21,775
‐What are you thinking?

1439
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:23,567
I told you to stay out of this.

1440
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:25,152
‐I figured you’d say that.

1441
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:33,329
SANGO: Kagome!

[chanting]

1443
01:29:54,556 --> 01:29:56,386
‐Another spell.

1444

Inuyasha!

1445
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:59,892
A direct attack won’t work!

1446
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:01,350
‐Well, it’s too late.

1447
01:30:01,438 --> 01:30:04,018
‐Return to my darkness
and vanish forever.

1448

‐Taste my Backlash Wave!

1449
01:30:16,161 --> 01:30:18,121
‐That pathetic trick won’t work.

1450
01:30:25,462 --> 01:30:27,052
‐It’s gone.

1451
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:27,760
‐Inuyasha.

1452
01:30:27,881 --> 01:30:29,091
It’s coming!

1453
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:30,094
‐Yeah, I know.

1454
01:30:38,058 --> 01:30:42,188
A frontal attack’s the only way.

1455
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:43,900
‐All right, Shippo.

1456
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:44,860
Ready for action?

1457
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:46,860
‐Yeah!

1458
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:47,782
‐Sorry.

1459
01:30:47,901 --> 01:30:48,781
‐Never mind.

1460
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:50,740
Forget my pain
and just shoot it.

‐Wind Scar!

1462

‐Is that the best you have
to offer me, half demon?

1463
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:05,131
‐Go!

1464
01:31:21,643 --> 01:31:23,143
‐How was that?

1465
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:30,820
KAGUYA: A mere half
demon, and a mortal.

1466
01:31:33,822 --> 01:31:35,412
‐We did it!

[shouting]

1468
01:31:39,995 --> 01:31:41,665
‐Hey Kagome, you need a lift?

1469
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:42,076
‐Yes.

1470
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:45,123
Thanks, Sango.

1471
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:46,128
‐Good catch, Sango.

1472
01:31:46,209 --> 01:31:46,999
We’re fine over here.

1473
01:31:47,085 --> 01:31:48,385
‐Oh, what a headache.

1474
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:58,433
‐What is that?

1475
01:31:58,513 --> 01:31:59,183
[laughter]

1476
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:00,264
KAGUYA: My body
may be destroyed,

1477
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:03,978
but I am heavenly being.

1478

You, girl with
the sacred powers,

1479
01:32:07,022 --> 01:32:09,442
your body shall be mine.

01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,122
‐Naraku!

1484
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:28,075
‐Come, Kaguya.

1485
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:29,089
‐Kagome.

1486
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:30,210
Get down!

1487
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:39,886
‐Inuyasha.

1488
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:40,301
‐Wind Tunnel!

1489
01:32:48,313 --> 01:32:50,063
‐Are you all right, Kagome?

1490
01:32:50,148 --> 01:32:50,728
‐Kagome.

1491
01:32:53,818 --> 01:32:54,188
Kohaku.

1492
01:33:01,367 --> 01:33:02,947
‐We’d better hurry
and get out of here.

1493
01:33:03,078 --> 01:33:04,118
‐Yeah, but how?

1494
01:33:04,245 --> 01:33:05,445
Which way is out?

1495
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:06,830
‐We’ll just follow Naraku.

1496
01:33:06,915 --> 01:33:08,255
That should get us back to land.

1497
01:33:25,183 --> 01:33:27,983
‐Wait, don’t leave me!

1498
01:33:28,103 --> 01:33:30,943
[wicked laughter]

1499
01:33:31,022 --> 01:33:31,192
‐Help.

1500
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:32,062
Help!

1501
01:33:32,148 --> 01:33:32,978
She’s coming!

1502
01:33:33,108 --> 01:33:34,648
Inuyasha, you coward.

1503
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:39,236
‐Huh?

1504
01:33:39,322 --> 01:33:40,952
Where’s Kaguya?

1505
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:41,532
‐Don’t worry.

1506
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:42,196
She’s gone.

1507
01:33:42,283 --> 01:33:43,783
We’re safe now.

1508
01:33:43,868 --> 01:33:44,658
‐Hey.

1509
01:33:44,786 --> 01:33:46,656
Look at that.

1510
01:33:46,788 --> 01:33:48,498
SHIPPO: The castle
is disappearing.

1511
01:33:52,293 --> 01:33:53,593
‐Look up there.

1512
01:33:58,258 --> 01:33:59,798
‐It’s all over.

1513
01:33:59,926 --> 01:34:00,966
‐No.

1514
01:34:01,094 --> 01:34:03,224
It’s not over quite yet.

1515
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:05,974
Naraku is still alive,
let’s not forget.

1516
01:34:06,099 --> 01:34:07,019
‐That’s true.

1517
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:09,812
But at least we were able to
destroy one thing he was after.

1518
01:34:09,936 --> 01:34:11,056
That’s something.

1519
01:34:11,146 --> 01:34:12,146
‐Hmph.

1520
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:13,270
Just one isn’t enough.

1521
01:34:13,356 --> 01:34:15,266
HACHI: Master Miroku!

1522
01:34:15,358 --> 01:34:17,278
Over here!

1523
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:17,740
‐Hachi!

1524
01:34:22,407 --> 01:34:24,327
[coughing]

1525
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:27,999
SANGO: You’re both all right.

1526
01:34:28,121 --> 01:34:29,961
‐Ms. Kagome, look.

1527
01:34:30,039 --> 01:34:32,999
I have the celestial robe back.

1528
01:34:33,084 --> 01:34:33,964
‐And look.

1529
01:34:34,043 --> 01:34:36,303
Your staff, Master Miroku.

1530
01:34:36,379 --> 01:34:37,339
‐It’s amazing.

1531
01:34:37,714 --> 01:34:40,844
When I came to, the robe
suddenly fell from heaven.

1532
01:34:40,925 --> 01:34:41,795
‐Wow.

1533
01:34:41,885 --> 01:34:44,435
It found its way back
to its rightful owner.

1534
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:48,272
Just like a puppy.

1535
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:48,849
MIROKU: Sango.

1536
01:34:48,933 --> 01:34:50,023
‐Hm?

1537
01:34:50,101 --> 01:34:53,851
‐Before he disappeared, I
heard Kohaku call you sister.

1538
01:34:53,938 --> 01:34:57,358
It may be small, but it’s
something to be glad for.

1539
01:34:57,442 --> 01:35:00,822
‐Thanks for saying that, Miroku.

1540
01:35:00,904 --> 01:35:01,954
I think so too.

1541
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:09,250
‐Grandfather.

1542
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:12,420
Kaguya was indeed a beauty.

1543
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:14,420
‐Such a fool.

1544
01:35:14,542 --> 01:35:16,752
‐You going somewhere
with this, Miroku?

1545
01:35:16,878 --> 01:35:18,668
‐No need to worry,
my dear Sango.

1546
01:35:18,755 --> 01:35:23,305
My heart belongs to you alone.

1547
01:35:23,384 --> 01:35:23,764
‐Idiot.

1548
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:30,270
KAGOME (VOICEOVER):
The shooting star

1549
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:32,521
granted at least
part of my wish.

1550
01:35:32,602 --> 01:35:36,272
Princess Kaguya of the ancient
legend returned to the moon.

1551
01:35:36,397 --> 01:35:40,437
Our journey, though,
is far from over.

1552
01:35:40,568 --> 01:35:41,398
SANGO: Kagome!

1553
01:35:41,486 --> 01:35:43,896
MIROKU: Kagome!

1554
01:35:44,030 --> 01:35:44,860
SHIPPO: Hurry up!

1555
01:35:44,948 --> 01:35:46,278
KAGOME: Wait up!

1556
01:35:46,407 --> 01:35:47,827
Why didn’t you tell
me you were going?

1557
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:49,409
INUYASHA: Ah, you
wouldn’t have noticed.

1558
01:35:49,535 --> 01:35:50,405
You’re always too
busy daydreaming.

1559
01:35:50,536 --> 01:35:52,326
KAGOME: I don’t like
that tone, mister.

1560
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:53,373
MIROKU: Now, now.

1561
01:35:53,456 --> 01:35:54,166
We destroyed Kaguya.

1562
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:56,959
Let’s be happy and
count our blessings.

1563
01:35:57,085 --> 01:35:57,845
SANGO: Yes.

1564
01:35:57,919 --> 01:35:59,039
That’s enough
fighting for one day.

1565
01:35:59,128 --> 01:36:01,918
[music playing]

1566
01:38:28,236 --> 01:38:28,646
‐Ah.

1567
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:30,906
This feels so good.

1568
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:31,490
‐Oh, yes.

1569
01:38:31,572 --> 01:38:33,872
That’s right.

1570
01:38:33,950 --> 01:38:35,280
Sango.

1571
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:38,330
We should follow suit.

1572
01:38:38,413 --> 01:38:39,793
‐Huh?

1573
01:38:39,914 --> 01:38:40,834
[slap]

1574
01:38:40,915 --> 01:38:42,325
MIROKU: Oi!

1575
01:38:42,417 --> 01:38:44,537
‐What do you think you’re doing?

1576
01:38:44,627 --> 01:38:45,537
‐What do you think?

1577
01:38:45,628 --> 01:38:47,048
Kagome and Inuyasha did it.

1578
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:49,760
Why don’t we reap the
benefits of intimacy?

1579
01:38:49,882 --> 01:38:52,262
‐I don’t know what
you’re talking about.

1580
01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:53,143
I’m not listening.

1581
01:38:53,261 --> 01:38:54,011
La la la la.

1582
01:38:54,095 --> 01:38:56,105
t wasn’t like I
wanted to do it to you.

1583
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:56,930
‐Hm?

1584
01:38:57,056 --> 01:38:58,096
‐Huh?

1585
01:38:58,182 --> 01:38:58,682
KAGOME: What exactly is
that supposed to mean?

1586
01:38:59,058 --> 01:39:00,888
UYASHA:it wasn’t my idea.

1587
01:39:00,977 --> 01:39:02,647
I mean, you’re the one
who forced yourself

1588
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:03,440
on me, remember?

1589
01:39:03,563 --> 01:39:05,153
KAGOME: Inuyasha!

1590
01:39:05,273 --> 01:39:05,613
Sit!

1591
01:39:09,610 --> 01:39:11,070
SHIPPO: Inuyasha.

1592
01:39:11,154 --> 01:39:13,284
Grow up, would you?
