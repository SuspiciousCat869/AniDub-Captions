1
00:00:11,182 --> 00:00:11,884
Hey...

2
00:00:12,341 --> 00:00:15,001
They say it's five centimeters per second.

3
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,731
Huh? What is?

4
00:00:16,842 --> 00:00:21,362
The speed cherry blossom petals
fall is five centimeters per second.

5
00:00:21,387 --> 00:00:22,105
Really...

6
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:24,791
You know a lot of stuff like that, Akari.

7
00:00:27,722 --> 00:00:31,047
You know, they look just like snowflakes...

8
00:00:31,847 --> 00:00:32,871
I guess...

9
00:00:34,758 --> 00:00:35,456
Hey!

10
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,329
Wait up!

11
00:00:45,234 --> 00:00:46,101
Akari!

12
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:47,334
Takaki.

13
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:53,746
I hope that we can see the cherry
blossoms together next spring.

14
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:08,999
Dear Takaki Tono...

15
00:01:09,222 --> 00:01:11,922
I'm sorry that I haven't written for so long.

16
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,327
Though summers are hot here too,

17
00:01:18,723 --> 00:01:20,995
they're a lot milder than Tokyo's.

18
00:01:21,686 --> 00:01:23,324
But when I think about it,

19
00:01:23,658 --> 00:01:26,957
I liked the hot, humid summers of Tokyo too.

20
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:29,372
The melting-hot pavement,

21
00:01:29,538 --> 00:01:33,211
and skyscrapers in the distant, shimmering in the heat,

22
00:01:33,432 --> 00:01:37,657
and the freezing air-conditioning
in department stores and on subways.

23
00:01:38,962 --> 00:01:43,037
The last time we were together was
at our elementary school graduation.

24
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:46,853
It's been half a year since then.

25
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,813
Do you still remember me?

26
00:01:52,326 --> 00:01:53,604
Dear Takaki...

27
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,781
Thank you for writing me back. It made me so happy.

28
00:01:59,538 --> 00:02:03,979
It's already well into autumn and
the leaves are turning beautiful colors.

29
00:02:04,773 --> 00:02:10,113
The day before yesterday, I pulled out
a sweater for the first time this year.

30
00:02:10,192 --> 00:02:10,771
Tono?

31
00:02:11,327 --> 00:02:11,875
Hi.

32
00:02:12,312 --> 00:02:13,868
What's that? A love letter?

33
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,235
No, it's not.

34
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:17,406
Sorry for having asked you to do all that.

35
00:02:17,564 --> 00:02:18,471
Oh, It's no problem.

36
00:02:18,534 --> 00:02:19,241
Thank you.

37
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:21,306
Hey, are you really transferring to another school?

38
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:23,231
Yeah, at the end of the school year.

39
00:02:23,258 --> 00:02:24,033
Where?

40
00:02:24,429 --> 00:02:26,631
To Kagoshima. Because of my parents.

41
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,440
Really? We'll miss you...

42
00:02:28,687 --> 00:02:32,278
Lately, I've been getting up
early because of school activities.

43
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,003
So, I'm writing this letter on the train.

44
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:37,617
I had my hair cut the other day.

45
00:02:38,236 --> 00:02:40,875
It's so short that my ears even show.

46
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,196
You probably wouldn't even recognize me.

47
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:44,009
I'm home.

48
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:44,941
Hi, Mom.

49
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:58,053
I bet you'll change little by little over time too.

50
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:15,458
Dear Takaki...

51
00:03:16,055 --> 00:03:18,851
Are you doing all right even with all this cold weather?

52
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:24,080
Here, it's already snowed a few times.

53
00:03:24,477 --> 00:03:29,537
Every time it does, I have to really
bundle myself up when I go to school.

54
00:03:30,034 --> 00:03:32,945
I'm sure it hasn't snowed in Tokyo yet, has it?

55
00:03:34,273 --> 00:03:39,207
I'm aways checking Tokyo's weather too,
even though I don't live there anymore.

56
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:45,578
I sure wish it would rain.

57
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,611
When being any easier indoors.

58
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:51,013
Hey, have either of you guys ever been to Tochigi?

59
00:03:51,275 --> 00:03:51,712
Where?

60
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:53,132
Tochigi.

61
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:53,825
Nope.

62
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,773
So you know how to get there?

63
00:03:56,064 --> 00:03:58,498
I don't know... On the bullet train maybe?

64
00:03:59,264 --> 00:04:00,272
A long way...

65
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:03,510
Freshman!

66
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:04,296
Coming!

67
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:06,319
Last three times!

68
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,612
Fight! Go! Fight! Go! Fight! Go!

69
00:04:08,637 --> 00:04:12,532
I was really surprised when I heard
that you'll be transferring schools.

70
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,995
We both got used to transferring
schools when we were little.

71
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:20,330
But still, Kagoshima...

72
00:04:20,924 --> 00:04:23,389
that's kind of far away, isn't it?

73
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:29,799
It's no longer a distance where I can just
jump on a train and see you whenever I want...

74
00:04:30,872 --> 00:04:32,578
It does make me feel...

75
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:35,927
Well... kind of sad.

76
00:04:36,883 --> 00:04:38,825
I just hope that you'll be fine.

77
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:54,760
Dear Takaki...

78
00:04:56,052 --> 00:04:59,171
I'm so happy we'll see each other on March 4th.

79
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:02,884
It'll have been a year since we last met.

80
00:05:03,299 --> 00:05:05,954
For some reason, I feel kind of nervous.

81
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:15,548
There's a big cherry tree by my house.

82
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:20,702
When the spring comes, the petals
will fall at five centimeters per second.

83
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,827
How I wish the spring could
come along with you on that day...

84
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,603
Do you wanna stop by somewhere on the way back?

85
00:05:49,013 --> 00:05:50,667
Might as well, since it's raining and all...

86
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:53,206
They said it's going to turn to
snow tonight on The weather report.

87
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:56,318
Really? I thought it felt cold.
And we're already in March...

88
00:05:56,491 --> 00:05:58,155
I hope we don't get colds.

89
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,038
Hey, we should go have something hot to drink.

90
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,506
Yeah, let's do that.

91
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:02,657
Tono.

92
00:06:03,453 --> 00:06:04,477
Let's get to practice.

93
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:06,252
Oh yeah, practice...

94
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:09,777
Actually, I can't make it today.

95
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,476
Getting ready to move?

96
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:13,518
Yeah. Sorry.

97
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:17,579
It's so nice of you, coming all the way to my station...

98
00:06:18,438 --> 00:06:21,910
It's a long trip, so be sure to take care of yourself.

99
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,872
I'll be waiting for you at 7:00 that
night in the station's waiting room.

100
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:48,447
That afternoon, on the day I was to meet Akari...

101
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,967
It started to snow.

102
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:57,473
Hey, Takaki. It's that cat, Chobi.

103
00:06:57,883 --> 00:06:59,886
He's the one that's always here, isn't he?

104
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:01,914
But it looks like he's alone today.

105
00:07:02,043 --> 00:07:03,557
Where's Mimi, Kiddy?

106
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,186
Aren't you kind of sad being all alone?

107
00:07:16,872 --> 00:07:17,904
How do you like the book?

108
00:07:18,087 --> 00:07:22,257
I like it. Last night I read four
billion years' worth of evolution.

109
00:07:22,282 --> 00:07:22,915
Which part?

110
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,904
Where they talk about the Anomalooaris.

111
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:26,292
The Cambrian Age!

112
00:07:26,403 --> 00:07:28,717
I really love the Halluoigenias.

113
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,384
They look like this.

114
00:07:30,942 --> 00:07:32,396
Yeah, something like that...

115
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:33,786
So what's your favorite?

116
00:07:33,914 --> 00:07:35,480
The Opabinia, I guess...

117
00:07:35,884 --> 00:07:37,840
He mean the one with five eyes?

118
00:07:38,014 --> 00:07:41,708
As I look back, I think Akari
and I were very alike somehow.

119
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,030
One year after I'd transferred to the school in Tokyo,

120
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,628
Akari transferred there, too, and was in my class.

121
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:52,296
We were both kind of small for our age,

122
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:57,400
and we both had really bad allergies, so
we preferred the library to the playground.

123
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:00,330
So, naturally, we got close to each other.

124
00:08:01,115 --> 00:08:03,181
It caused our classmates to tease us.

125
00:08:05,973 --> 00:08:11,120
But it didn't matter much to us
because of the friendship we had.

126
00:08:11,176 --> 00:08:12,516
Aw, It's so cute.

127
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:21,795
For some reason, I just assumed that
we'd be going to the same junior high...

128
00:08:24,113 --> 00:08:26,318
and that we'd be always together.

129
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:32,245
Shinjuku, Shinjuku. This is the terminal station.

130
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:39,468
For passengers getting off, please change
to the kyo-O subway for all J.R. lines.

131
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:44,869
It was the first time I had
been to Shinjuku Station alone.

132
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,969
And it would be the first time I had
been to any of those places on my route.

133
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:58,558
My heart was pounding.

134
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,152
I was going to meet Akari.

135
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:12,860
So tell me, how did it go with that guy?

136
00:09:12,915 --> 00:09:13,469
Who?

137
00:09:13,677 --> 00:09:14,906
The one from Nishi Sapporo.

138
00:09:15,172 --> 00:09:17,024
Him? Don't you think he's a dork?

139
00:09:17,054 --> 00:09:19,811
We'll soon be arriving at Musashi Urawa station.

140
00:09:20,987 --> 00:09:22,972
Musashi Urawa station.

141
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:26,612
There wll be a 4-minute stop
as we wait for a "Rapid" line.

142
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:32,179
Passengers heading to Yonohon Town and
Omiya, please change to the express line.

143
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,516
Um... This is Akari Shinohara.

144
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,338
May I speak to Takaki please?

145
00:09:59,954 --> 00:10:01,060
It's Akari.

146
00:10:03,554 --> 00:10:05,000
Transferring schools?

147
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:07,494
What about Nishi Junior High?

148
00:10:07,655 --> 00:10:09,592
After all that work to get a exam it.

149
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:14,097
They said they'd do the paperwork
to get me into a school in Tochigi.

150
00:10:14,444 --> 00:10:15,644
I'm sorry.

151
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:19,659
No... There's nothing for you to apologize for...

152
00:10:19,945 --> 00:10:24,165
I told them I wanted to stay with
my aunt in Katsushika, and commute.

153
00:10:24,284 --> 00:10:27,382
But they objected, saying I'd
have to wait until I'm older...

154
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:29,400
All right.

155
00:10:29,607 --> 00:10:30,853
Don't tell me any more!

156
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,354
That's enough.

157
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:37,121
Sorry...

158
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,675
I held the receiver so tight against my ear,

159
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,542
it was as though I could feel
Akari's pain directly through the phone.

160
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,681
But there was nothing I could do.

161
00:10:54,593 --> 00:10:55,387
That was tasted good!

162
00:10:55,412 --> 00:10:56,896
Yeah. thanks a lot, good bye!

163
00:10:56,921 --> 00:10:57,546
See you later.

164
00:10:57,571 --> 00:11:01,410
The terminal station, where I switched
trains, was filled with commuters heading home.

165
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:04,747
Everyone's shoes were soaked with snow and water.

166
00:11:05,334 --> 00:11:10,744
The air was chilly and full of that
certain smell a city has on a snowy day.

167
00:11:11,621 --> 00:11:13,837
This is an announcement for all passengers.

168
00:11:13,936 --> 00:11:17,977
Utsunomiya lines bound for Oyama and Utsunomiya

169
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:21,548
wll arrive 8 minutes behind schedule due to heavy snow.

170
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:22,838
We apologize for any inconvenience.

171
00:11:22,863 --> 00:11:25,513
Until that moment, it never even crossed my mind

172
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:28,262
that the train might be delayed.

173
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,691
Suddenly I became really worried.

174
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:40,008
Due to snow, this train is
running 10 minutes behind schedule.

175
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:43,518
Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience.

176
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,834
A short while after passing Omiya Station,

177
00:11:51,636 --> 00:11:56,549
the buildings dotting the
scenery became few and far between

178
00:11:57,965 --> 00:12:00,519
in what seemed like the blink of an eye.

179
00:12:07,032 --> 00:12:09,015
The next stop is Kuki.

180
00:12:10,657 --> 00:12:13,717
We apologize for having arrived far behind schedule.

181
00:12:14,257 --> 00:12:17,253
Those passengers changing to the Tobuiseisaki line

182
00:12:17,296 --> 00:12:19,342
please proceed to line 5.

183
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:27,049
This train wll stop for 10 minutes at this
station due to the late arrival of a connecting train.

184
00:12:27,612 --> 00:12:31,235
We apologize for the delay,
and appreciate your understanding.

185
00:12:34,842 --> 00:12:35,749
Sorry, sir...

186
00:12:35,932 --> 00:12:41,072
This train wll stop for 10 minutes at this
station due to the late arrival of a connecting train.

187
00:12:41,516 --> 00:12:44,924
We apologize for the delay, and
appreciate your understanding...

188
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,733
This is Nogi.

189
00:13:08,002 --> 00:13:13,005
We would like to express our apologies as
this train wll temporarily stop at this station,

190
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:16,084
due to the late arrival of a connecting train.

191
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,787
The stations seemed unbelievably far apart.

192
00:13:20,636 --> 00:13:23,156
And each time the train stopped at a station,

193
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,800
Seemed like an eternity.

194
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:52,091
The unfamiliar snow-covered wilderness outside the window,

195
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,833
the slow passage of time,

196
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:56,807
and hunger...

197
00:13:58,055 --> 00:14:00,440
All of these added to my feeling of uneasiness.

198
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,109
I'm already late to meet her.

199
00:14:04,936 --> 00:14:06,677
I'm sure she's starting to worry...

200
00:14:13,076 --> 00:14:14,037
On that day...

201
00:14:14,814 --> 00:14:16,330
the day I got that call...

202
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,478
Akari must have been much more upset than even I was.

203
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,251
And I wasn't able to comfort her...

204
00:14:24,883 --> 00:14:26,841
I felt so ashamed of myself.

205
00:14:34,063 --> 00:14:38,211
Well... I guess today we say good-bye...

206
00:14:40,472 --> 00:14:43,239
I received the first letter from her half a year later.

207
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:46,550
During the summer of my first year in junior high.

208
00:14:48,372 --> 00:14:49,842
I knew her letter by heart.

209
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,369
Over the two weeks before the day we were to meet,

210
00:14:54,238 --> 00:14:56,136
I wrote a letter to give to Akari.

211
00:14:58,082 --> 00:15:00,949
There were just so many things that I wanted to tell her.

212
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:05,284
So many things I wanted to ask her.

213
00:15:05,692 --> 00:15:10,212
We apologize for the delay. The
train wll soon depart for Utsunomiya.

214
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,783
This is Oyama.

215
00:15:23,808 --> 00:15:27,259
Passengers on the bullet train
bound for Tohoku change here.

216
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:30,560
Those passengers bound for
Morioka on the Tohoku Bullet train

217
00:15:30,585 --> 00:15:32,722
please proceed to line 1.

218
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:37,242
Passengers bound for Tokyo please proceed to line 5.

219
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:40,868
The passengers taking the Mito line...

220
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,567
The followng is an announcement for all passengers.

221
00:15:43,592 --> 00:15:48,373
Trains running on the Ryomo lines are running
significantly behind schedule due to heavy snow.

222
00:15:48,651 --> 00:15:53,228
We apologize forthis delay. And ask that you
wait patiently for the arrival of the trains.

223
00:15:55,763 --> 00:15:56,716
All I could do...

224
00:15:57,694 --> 00:16:01,392
...was to keep heading for the
station where Akari was waiting for me.

225
00:16:55,525 --> 00:17:00,530
Line 8, from Ashikaga / Maebashi and
bound for Takasaki, is now arriving.

226
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:03,858
Please remain inside the white
lines when exiting the train.

227
00:17:34,997 --> 00:17:37,338
This announcement is for all passengers.

228
00:17:37,703 --> 00:17:42,143
Due to heavy snowfall, service forthis train
wll be delayed for the sake of route rescheduling.

229
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:47,325
We apologize forthis delay, but at present are
not at liberty to say when service wll resume.

230
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,333
I repeat:

231
00:17:48,595 --> 00:17:53,362
Due to heavy snowfall, service for this train
wll be delayed for the sake of route rescheduling.

232
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:58,756
We apologize forthis delay, but at present are
not at liberty to say when service wll resume.

233
00:18:03,345 --> 00:18:05,756
Dear Takaki, how are you?

234
00:18:06,515 --> 00:18:10,498
Lately I've been getting up early
because I'm busy with school activities.

235
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:15,416
When I read her letters, I always envisioned her alone.

236
00:18:20,588 --> 00:18:26,374
In the end, the train spent around two
hours, motionless, in the middle of nowhere.

237
00:18:27,588 --> 00:18:29,756
Every minute seemed like an eternity.

238
00:18:31,312 --> 00:18:35,677
Time felt heavy with malice, as it slowly crept by.

239
00:18:37,939 --> 00:18:43,462
All I could do was grit my teeth
and try to hold back my tears.

240
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:46,329
Akari.

241
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:48,901
Please...

242
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:51,477
Please...

243
00:18:52,814 --> 00:18:57,311
Don't wait for me... If you'd just go back home...

244
00:19:11,725 --> 00:19:16,886
Line 3, from Ashikaga / Maebashi and
bound for Takasaki, is now arriving.

245
00:19:16,911 --> 00:19:20,944
Due to heavy snowfall, service
forthis train wll be temporarily delayed.

246
00:19:58,639 --> 00:19:59,591
Akari.

247
00:20:29,824 --> 00:20:30,808
This is good...

248
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:34,056
Really? It's just regular roasted tea.

249
00:20:34,422 --> 00:20:37,663
Roasted tea? I've never had it before.

250
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:40,351
What?! I'm sure you have.

251
00:20:40,563 --> 00:20:41,332
You think?

252
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:42,685
Of course!

253
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:45,154
I made this for you.

254
00:20:45,503 --> 00:20:47,634
So, I can't promise it's any good.

255
00:20:48,155 --> 00:20:49,462
Have some if you want.

256
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:51,273
Thank you.

257
00:20:52,754 --> 00:20:54,324
I haven't eaten in hours.

258
00:20:58,073 --> 00:20:59,816
So... How is it?

259
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,113
I've never had anything so delicious before.

260
00:21:06,735 --> 00:21:08,457
You're exaggerating!

261
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:09,668
I'm serious!

262
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,276
It's just because you're hungry.

263
00:21:11,379 --> 00:21:12,133
You think?

264
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:13,786
I'm sure it is.

265
00:21:13,992 --> 00:21:15,146
I'll have some, too.

266
00:21:20,394 --> 00:21:22,609
You're going to move soon, right?

267
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,007
Yeah, next week.

268
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:25,650
Kagoshima, huh...

269
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:26,959
It's so far away.

270
00:21:27,295 --> 00:21:28,054
Yeah...

271
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,998
But it turned out that Tochigi is quite a ways away, too!

272
00:21:31,054 --> 00:21:34,047
It is. I guess you won't be able to go home now!

273
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,578
We're gonna have to close up kids,
I'm sorry there are no more trains.

274
00:21:39,603 --> 00:21:40,206
Okay.

275
00:21:40,436 --> 00:21:42,653
Take care, it's snowing heavily out there.

276
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:43,386
Thank you.

277
00:22:07,322 --> 00:22:09,435
Can you see it? That tree?

278
00:22:10,283 --> 00:22:11,696
The one you wrote about in your letter?

279
00:22:11,816 --> 00:22:13,366
Yes, the cherry tree.

280
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,288
Hey...

281
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,776
They look like snowflakes.

282
00:22:32,778 --> 00:22:33,870
You are right, they do.

283
00:22:44,486 --> 00:22:45,859
At that moment...

284
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:52,224
I felt like I understood things like the
existence of eternity, the heart and the soul.

285
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:57,485
I felt as though we had shared
all the experiences of my 13 years.

286
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,344
And the next moment...

287
00:23:03,706 --> 00:23:06,415
I became unbearably sad.

288
00:23:07,827 --> 00:23:11,333
Sad because I didn't know what
to do with her warmth against me

289
00:23:11,913 --> 00:23:16,919
or what to do with that soul, or
how long I should hold onto them.

290
00:23:18,734 --> 00:23:24,005
I also came to the clear realization
that we would not be able to remain together.

291
00:23:25,761 --> 00:23:32,767
The overwhelming weight of our lives to
come and the uncertainty of time hung over us.

292
00:23:35,184 --> 00:23:39,643
But soon, all my fears began to melt away,

293
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,631
leaving only Akari's soft lips on mine.

294
00:24:04,451 --> 00:24:09,069
That night, we stayed in a tiny
shack by the corner of a field.

295
00:24:11,379 --> 00:24:15,362
Wrapped up in an old blanket, we talked all night...

296
00:24:16,878 --> 00:24:19,270
Until finally, we fell asleep.

297
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,998
The next morning, when the train
is started, I got ready leave.

298
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,808
And there, Akari and I said good-bye.

299
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:28,630
I...

300
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,479
Takaki...

301
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:35,882
Takaki, I think you'll be...

302
00:24:35,922 --> 00:24:38,799
You will be okay! I know you will be!

303
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,045
Thank you for that.

304
00:24:41,466 --> 00:24:43,152
Take care of yourself! Akari

305
00:24:43,661 --> 00:24:45,820
I'll write to you. I'll call!

306
00:24:59,629 --> 00:25:03,380
I didn't even mention the letter I lost.

307
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,402
Because after we'd kissed...

308
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:13,097
...it seemed like the whole world had completely changed.

309
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:24,242
I wanted so badly to be able to protect her.

310
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,606
That was all I could think about,

311
00:25:30,078 --> 00:25:32,633
as I gazed absently out the window.

312
00:27:02,008 --> 00:27:03,984
Kanae, you going after class too?

313
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:05,960
Yeah, how about you, Sis?

314
00:27:05,985 --> 00:27:08,716
Sure. But make sure you do your homework too. Okay?

315
00:27:08,786 --> 00:27:09,834
I will.

316
00:27:39,846 --> 00:27:40,710
Here goes...

317
00:27:55,076 --> 00:27:56,008
Good morning, Kanae.

318
00:27:56,782 --> 00:27:59,576
Hello, Tono. You're early again.

319
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:00,687
You too, Sumida.

320
00:28:01,131 --> 00:28:02,178
Did you go to the beach?

321
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,179
Sure did.

322
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:04,815
You're practicing hard.

323
00:28:06,442 --> 00:28:08,375
Well, not really...

324
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:10,722
See you later, Tono.

325
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:11,321
Later.

326
00:28:13,912 --> 00:28:16,692
Are we ready? It's about time to make your decisions.

327
00:28:16,827 --> 00:28:19,017
I need all of you to get this to me by Monday.

328
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,607
Talk it over with your parents.

329
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,237
It sounds like Sasaki's going to a university in Tokyo.

330
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,505
I'll probably have to go to
some junior college in Kumamoto.

331
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,294
And you, Kanae?

332
00:28:31,444 --> 00:28:32,175
Well...

333
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:34,835
So, will you get a job?

334
00:28:36,012 --> 00:28:36,414
Ummm...

335
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:38,747
You're not thinking about anything, are you?

336
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,685
Nothing except Takaki Tono.

337
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:43,156
I bet he has a girl back in Tokyo.

338
00:28:43,252 --> 00:28:44,078
Cut it out!

339
00:29:11,972 --> 00:29:13,417
Still having a rough time?

340
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,062
I don't know what's wrong...

341
00:29:16,741 --> 00:29:18,907
You shouldn't worry yourself so much.

342
00:29:19,074 --> 00:29:20,812
You'll catch a right way again.

343
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,110
You're so easygoing, you know that.

344
00:29:23,216 --> 00:29:24,721
So, what's the big rush?

345
00:29:26,813 --> 00:29:29,765
Keep this up, I'll graduate without saying anything...

346
00:29:49,282 --> 00:29:50,889
Okay, thanks a lot. See you later.

347
00:29:50,971 --> 00:29:52,216
I can give you a ride.

348
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:54,068
That's all right. I'll take my scooter.

349
00:30:22,108 --> 00:30:23,688
Sumida, you heading home now?

350
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:25,667
Uh... yeah. You too, Tono?

351
00:30:25,983 --> 00:30:26,548
Uh-huh.

352
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:28,303
Want to head back together?

353
00:30:32,118 --> 00:30:35,197
If I was a dog, my tail would wagging so hard.

354
00:30:35,606 --> 00:30:38,046
My happiness would have been obvious.

355
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,688
I heaved the sigh of relief, thinking
it was a good thing I wasn't a dog...

356
00:30:43,855 --> 00:30:46,803
And I was amazed with how stupid a thought that was...

357
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,523
even for me.

358
00:30:49,365 --> 00:30:49,959
Yet...

359
00:30:51,436 --> 00:30:54,217
The ride back home with Tono made me so happy.

360
00:30:54,844 --> 00:30:59,094
Right from the beginning, Tono
seemed somehow different from others.

361
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:01,661
I'm Takaki Tono.

362
00:31:01,918 --> 00:31:06,490
I'm used to transferring schools because of my
Dad's job, but I'm not used to this island yet.

363
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:08,269
It's nice to meet you all.

364
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:11,742
That very day, when I was in
8th grade, I fell in love with him.

365
00:31:12,297 --> 00:31:15,538
I studied hard because I wanted to
go to the same high school as him...

366
00:31:16,193 --> 00:31:19,804
And somehow, I managed to pass
my school's entrance exams...

367
00:31:20,703 --> 00:31:23,380
The more I see Tono, the more I love him.

368
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,360
It's been scary... Every day's been painful.

369
00:31:26,741 --> 00:31:30,657
But... Every time I see him, I'm happy.
And there was nothing I could do about it.

370
00:31:32,242 --> 00:31:34,043
Tono, same thing again?

371
00:31:34,448 --> 00:31:35,480
It's so good!

372
00:31:36,363 --> 00:31:40,106
You really think about things, I mean
there's always so much thought involved.

373
00:31:40,162 --> 00:31:41,623
Yeah, I guess.

374
00:31:43,198 --> 00:31:45,015
Okay, I'll be outside.

375
00:31:45,117 --> 00:31:45,841
Okay...

376
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:47,342
I'll have this.

377
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:48,748
That'll be 90 yen.

378
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:49,841
Here.

379
00:31:49,944 --> 00:31:51,651
Thank you very much.

380
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:03,807
There you are. What did you buy?

381
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:08,755
Well, at first I couldn't decide, but...

382
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,568
Sometimes I see Tono writing e-mails to somebody.

383
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:15,469
I can't help wishing that he was writing to me...

384
00:32:16,244 --> 00:32:17,623
Every time I see it.

385
00:32:27,832 --> 00:32:29,316
Hey, Cub! I'm home!

386
00:32:29,525 --> 00:32:32,088
Come here, Cub! I'm back now!

387
00:32:51,755 --> 00:32:54,281
The followng is a Town Hall announcement:

388
00:32:54,377 --> 00:33:00,289
The Kanae Sumida of class 3-1 police
report to Mr. Ito in the counseling room.

389
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,835
Kanae Sumida of class 3-1.

390
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,982
Please report to Mr. Ito in the counseling room.

391
00:33:04,007 --> 00:33:05,719
Hey Tono, that's your girl.

392
00:33:05,912 --> 00:33:07,370
She's not my girlfriend.

393
00:33:10,861 --> 00:33:13,778
We're at year-end, and you're
the only one not to turn this in.

394
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:14,963
I'm sorry.

395
00:33:14,988 --> 00:33:17,854
Hey, I really don't want to say it like this...

396
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,136
But, this is not something to
get yourself so worked up over.

397
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:22,907
Has your sister said anything to you about?

398
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,669
No...

399
00:33:26,491 --> 00:33:30,504
If you can't make up your mind, why not
try a junior college in the prefecture?

400
00:33:30,818 --> 00:33:31,861
Because...

401
00:33:33,706 --> 00:33:36,396
This doesn't have anything to do with my sister...

402
00:33:56,506 --> 00:33:57,379
I mean...

403
00:33:57,497 --> 00:34:01,701
whether it's this surting, which I
nagged my sister to let me start, or him,

404
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,570
the most important person in the entire world to me...

405
00:34:04,914 --> 00:34:07,136
I'm not getting anywhere with either...

406
00:34:31,244 --> 00:34:32,908
Thanks again. Good night to you.

407
00:34:33,577 --> 00:34:36,183
Thanks. Have a nice night. See you later.

408
00:35:04,175 --> 00:35:08,447
When I get near Tono I get this
tight sensation deep in my chest.

409
00:35:11,188 --> 00:35:12,053
Tono.

410
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:15,200
Sumida, What's up? How did you know I was here?

411
00:35:16,288 --> 00:35:19,952
I saw your scooter, so I stopped by. Is that okay?

412
00:35:20,214 --> 00:35:22,340
Yeah. I'm glad you came by.

413
00:35:22,796 --> 00:35:25,577
I mean, since we couldn't meet in
the parking lot like we usually do.

414
00:35:25,816 --> 00:35:26,522
Yeah!

415
00:35:27,546 --> 00:35:29,009
He's so nice...

416
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:32,274
Sometimes it makes me want to cry.

417
00:35:34,818 --> 00:35:38,360
Hey Tono. Are you going to test to get into college?

418
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:40,457
Yeah, a college in Tokyo.

419
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,818
Tokyo... Really...

420
00:35:43,123 --> 00:35:44,468
I kind of thought so...

421
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:45,773
Why's that?

422
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:50,473
You just kinda seem like you want to
go somewhere far away. For some reason...

423
00:35:51,013 --> 00:35:52,221
How about you, Sumida?

424
00:35:53,572 --> 00:35:55,646
I don't even know what I'll do tomorrow.

425
00:35:56,972 --> 00:35:58,268
Maybe nobody does.

426
00:35:58,485 --> 00:36:00,413
Really?! Even you?

427
00:36:00,762 --> 00:36:01,730
Naturally.

428
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:04,817
But you seem to know exactly what you are doing.

429
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:08,049
That's weird because I don't
really. I'm lost all the time.

430
00:36:08,787 --> 00:36:11,362
I just do what I can. That's all I can do.

431
00:36:12,911 --> 00:36:13,729
Really?

432
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:16,995
Yeah, you're right.

433
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:24,798
Making a plane?

434
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:25,679
Yes.

435
00:37:16,581 --> 00:37:17,678
That's amazing.

436
00:37:18,923 --> 00:37:20,795
Told at five km per hour.

437
00:37:22,087 --> 00:37:24,152
To the South Tanega launch facility.

438
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:24,954
Huh.

439
00:37:26,068 --> 00:37:28,372
There's gonna be a launch this year, isn't there?

440
00:37:28,761 --> 00:37:29,316
Yeah.

441
00:37:29,645 --> 00:37:32,351
They say it's going to go all the
way to center of the solar system...

442
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:34,029
It'll take years...

443
00:37:52,472 --> 00:37:57,474
I want you to give Kanae advice
on her future. She's so unfocused.

444
00:37:58,015 --> 00:38:00,746
She'll be all right. She's not a kid anymore.

445
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,686
You know I was just like her at her age.

446
00:38:10,608 --> 00:38:14,092
Listen Cub, Tono doesn't know where he's going either.

447
00:38:14,483 --> 00:38:16,867
He's just like me, that Tono.

448
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:20,196
It must really be...

449
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:23,341
...a lonelier journey than anyone could imagine.

450
00:38:25,725 --> 00:38:27,793
Cutting through absolute darkness...

451
00:38:28,877 --> 00:38:32,369
...encountering nothing except
the occasional stray hydrogen atom.

452
00:38:33,057 --> 00:38:39,208
Flying blindly into the abyss, believing there in
lie the answers to the mysteries of the universe.

453
00:38:44,852 --> 00:38:45,630
And us...

454
00:38:46,534 --> 00:38:48,979
To that end, how far should we go?

455
00:38:49,883 --> 00:38:51,443
And how far can we go?

456
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:16,334
I wonder when I got in the habit
of writing messages to nobody?

457
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:55,284
Kanae, have you figured out what
you're going to do after your graduation?

458
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,945
Not yet. But it's fine...

459
00:39:58,008 --> 00:39:59,262
I've made a decision.

460
00:39:59,675 --> 00:40:02,131
I'll just start by doing each and every thing that I can!

461
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:03,361
I'm off!

462
00:40:20,645 --> 00:40:24,240
After that day, several typhoons have passed the island.

463
00:40:24,508 --> 00:40:26,983
And each time they did, it became cooler.

464
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:33,569
The wind that blew across the
sugarcane fields got crisper.

465
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:35,547
The sky looked a little bigger.

466
00:40:35,821 --> 00:40:38,176
And the outlines of the clouds grew softer.

467
00:40:38,621 --> 00:40:42,021
The kids in my grade who rode
scooters started wearing their jackets.

468
00:40:58,168 --> 00:41:02,044
Then, on a mid-October day
tinged with the remains of summer,

469
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:05,840
I rode a wave for the first time in six months.

470
00:41:17,044 --> 00:41:21,978
Tonight's forecast is clear wth
maximum wnd speeds of 8 meters per second.

471
00:41:22,071 --> 00:41:24,733
I heard Yamada told Sasaki that he likes her.

472
00:41:25,114 --> 00:41:26,556
That is expected.

473
00:41:26,934 --> 00:41:29,756
Huh? Kanae, you sure seem happy today.

474
00:41:29,908 --> 00:41:31,398
Did something happen with Tono?

475
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,131
No way?!

476
00:41:34,195 --> 00:41:35,005
All right, class.

477
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:37,409
What is important is this formula? It's...

478
00:41:43,756 --> 00:41:46,473
Today, I'm going to tell Tono how I feel about him.

479
00:41:46,677 --> 00:41:51,238
If I don't tell him today, after
riding that wave... I'll never be able to.

480
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:01,450
Sumida.

481
00:42:03,973 --> 00:42:05,253
Hello, Tono.

482
00:42:05,786 --> 00:42:06,692
Heading home now?

483
00:42:06,929 --> 00:42:07,502
Yeah.

484
00:42:07,621 --> 00:42:08,200
Really...

485
00:42:08,507 --> 00:42:10,345
Well... let's head home together.

486
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:35,144
Oh! You decided already?

487
00:42:35,836 --> 00:42:36,444
Yeah.

488
00:42:48,134 --> 00:42:48,834
What is it?

489
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,526
Don't be so...

490
00:42:57,551 --> 00:42:58,359
So what?

491
00:43:00,307 --> 00:43:01,323
Sorry...

492
00:43:01,785 --> 00:43:02,855
It's nothing.

493
00:43:11,763 --> 00:43:12,542
Something wrong?

494
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,179
Yeah, that's strange...

495
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:17,224
No good?

496
00:43:17,284 --> 00:43:18,181
No...

497
00:43:18,427 --> 00:43:19,938
I wonder if the spark plug's dead...

498
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:21,399
Was this a hand-me-down?

499
00:43:21,424 --> 00:43:22,972
Yeah, from my big sister.

500
00:43:23,298 --> 00:43:25,012
Was it cutting out on you when you'd accelerate?

501
00:43:25,037 --> 00:43:26,213
It might have been...

502
00:43:27,724 --> 00:43:32,018
Well, let's leave them both here. We can
have somebody can pick them up later for us.

503
00:43:32,122 --> 00:43:33,172
We can walk it.

504
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:37,393
I can walk by myself, Tono. You just head on home.

505
00:43:38,011 --> 00:43:39,830
I've only got a little ways left to go.

506
00:43:40,094 --> 00:43:41,714
Besides, I kind of feel like walking.

507
00:44:18,921 --> 00:44:19,747
Tono.

508
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,025
Please...

509
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:32,791
What's wrong?

510
00:44:34,093 --> 00:44:36,511
Sorry, it's nothing.

511
00:44:36,717 --> 00:44:37,733
I'm sorry...

512
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:40,735
Sumida...

513
00:44:43,574 --> 00:44:46,068
I'm begging you... please...

514
00:44:46,257 --> 00:44:48,225
...don't be so nice to me.

515
00:46:24,714 --> 00:46:28,232
Desperately, reaching recklessly towards the sky...

516
00:46:28,669 --> 00:46:31,620
Launching that massive object, in search of something

517
00:46:32,525 --> 00:46:35,414
almost overwhelmingly far off in the distance...

518
00:46:41,751 --> 00:46:45,337
I began to understand why Tono
seemed different from the others.

519
00:46:46,212 --> 00:46:51,328
At the same time, I came to a very clear
realization that Tono was never looking at me.

520
00:46:52,206 --> 00:46:54,783
So that day, I didn't say anything to Tono.

521
00:46:59,218 --> 00:47:01,006
Tono is certainly nice...

522
00:47:01,547 --> 00:47:03,047
Very nice indeed...

523
00:47:15,076 --> 00:47:15,674
But...

524
00:47:16,031 --> 00:47:18,199
Tono's always looking past me...

525
00:47:18,734 --> 00:47:20,481
At something far beyond.

526
00:47:23,183 --> 00:47:26,563
I guess my wishes to be with Tono will never come true.

527
00:47:27,771 --> 00:47:28,985
But I still...

528
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:42,405
But I still won't be able to stop loving him.

529
00:47:43,516 --> 00:47:47,981
Not today, not tomorrow, not ever.

530
00:47:49,547 --> 00:47:51,786
I fell asleep that night crying,

531
00:47:57,991 --> 00:48:01,819
the only thoughts in my head being of Tono...

532
00:49:30,177 --> 00:49:31,361
I felt it strongly...

533
00:49:32,066 --> 00:49:35,783
that if I'd turned around at that
moment, she'd have turned to look at me too.

534
00:49:49,735 --> 00:49:53,948
The last Chuo line train bound for Tokyo is now arriving.

535
00:51:09,484 --> 00:51:12,033
I wish you'd stay for the New Year's holiday...

536
00:51:12,058 --> 00:51:14,924
I know, but I have a lot of preparations.

537
00:51:15,083 --> 00:51:16,218
I suppose so.

538
00:51:16,701 --> 00:51:18,563
Make sure you cook something nice for him.

539
00:51:18,635 --> 00:51:19,436
I will.

540
00:51:19,555 --> 00:51:21,647
Call us anytime you need to, Akari.

541
00:51:21,695 --> 00:51:22,449
Okay?

542
00:51:22,474 --> 00:51:23,504
I'll be fine.

543
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:25,627
I'll see you again at the wedding next month.

544
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:27,366
Don't worry so much.

545
00:51:27,905 --> 00:51:30,098
You'd better head home. It's cold.

546
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:53,375
Last night I dreamt about the past.

547
00:51:54,565 --> 00:51:56,491
When we were both still children.

548
00:51:57,224 --> 00:52:01,592
I guess it's because of the old letter I found yesterday.

549
00:52:56,086 --> 00:52:56,835
Mizuno.

550
00:52:57,143 --> 00:52:57,651
Yes?

551
00:52:57,676 --> 00:52:58,675
The meeting. Let's go.

552
00:52:58,931 --> 00:52:59,670
Coming.

553
00:53:08,362 --> 00:53:12,834
In just living my life, it's as
though sadness piles up all around me.

554
00:53:13,835 --> 00:53:16,068
It's on my bed, dried in the sun...

555
00:53:16,456 --> 00:53:18,101
the toothbrush in my bathroom...

556
00:53:19,049 --> 00:53:20,873
In the memory of my cell-phone...

557
00:53:44,787 --> 00:53:45,898
"I still love you."

558
00:53:47,304 --> 00:53:50,795
That's what the girl I'd been with
for three years said in that e-mail.

559
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:55,379
She wrote, "We must have exchanged e-mails 1000 times.

560
00:53:56,609 --> 00:53:59,284
But I doubt our hearts got
closer by more than a centimeter."

561
00:54:08,997 --> 00:54:12,301
For the past few years, I've wanted to move on...

562
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,208
To grasp onto something beyond my reach...

563
00:54:15,438 --> 00:54:17,765
What that is, I don't even know...

564
00:54:18,575 --> 00:54:20,571
All I've been able to do is go on working,

565
00:54:21,047 --> 00:54:23,551
not knowing where these obsessive thoughts come from...

566
00:54:24,005 --> 00:54:29,327
Then one day I realized that my heart was
withering, and in it there was nothing but pain.

567
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,075
Then one morning...

568
00:54:31,284 --> 00:54:37,669
...I realized that my beliefs, that I once
held so passionately, had completely disappeared.

569
00:54:38,393 --> 00:54:41,141
That was it, I couldn't take any more.

570
00:54:42,819 --> 00:54:44,094
So I quit my job.

571
00:55:09,651 --> 00:55:11,067
Yesterday I had a dream.

572
00:55:12,457 --> 00:55:14,060
A dream of long ago.

573
00:55:14,464 --> 00:55:17,277
In the dream, we were still 13 years old.

574
00:55:18,825 --> 00:55:21,861
And we were standing in a field covered with snow...

575
00:55:23,163 --> 00:55:25,597
where in the dim light from distant houses,

576
00:55:25,769 --> 00:55:29,758
our footsteps were all that could
be seen in the new-fallen snow.

577
00:55:30,237 --> 00:55:34,430
And because of that, we both
believed without any doubt that.

578
00:55:34,455 --> 00:55:39,427
Someday, together we'd watch
the cherry blossoms fall again...

579
00:55:39,882 --> 00:55:40,694
...Again.
