one of their hideouts.

00:09:12.406 --> 00:09:15.643 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let the Prefectural Police
handle it.

00:09:15.676 --> 00:09:18.679 position:5% line:83% align:start
Grab a subordinate and
go out to this location.

00:09:18.712 --> 00:09:22.448 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's a hideout that Kagael
told us about in his debriefing.

00:09:22.482 --> 00:09:24.617 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh. You sure, Chief?

00:09:24.651 --> 00:09:27.020 position:21% line:83% align:start
I mean, don't you think
a mainstream job like that

00:09:27.053 --> 00:09:28.855 position:33% line:83% align:start
is more up
Togusa's alley?

00:09:28.888 --> 00:09:31.624 position:5% line:83% align:start
Togusa's...coming with me
to the dungeon.

00:09:31.658 --> 00:09:33.892 position:38% line:89% align:start
Ah, I follow you.

00:09:33.926 --> 00:09:37.764 position:13% line:83% align:start
We're gonna be here a while.
Somebody go get takeout.

00:09:38.864 --> 00:09:41.134 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:09:41.167 --> 00:09:43.935 position:5% line:89% align:start
Question, how long has it been

00:09:43.969 --> 00:09:46.938 position:5% line:83% align:start
since the Major resigned
from Section 9, Togusa?

00:09:46.972 --> 00:09:50.208 position:19% line:83% align:start
I guess it's
nearly two years.

00:09:50.242 --> 00:09:53.446 position:5% line:89% align:start
That long?

00:09:53.479 --> 00:09:57.149 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry about
what happened with Kagael.

00:09:57.182 --> 00:09:58.785 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's not your fault.

00:09:58.817 --> 00:10:02.087 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is a vital matter
which might ultimately prove

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.090 position:5% line:83% align:start
to be the Prime Minister's
Achilles heel.

00:10:05.123 --> 00:10:07.993 position:5% line:83% align:start
I suspect her intention
is to keep a lid on things

00:10:08.026 --> 00:10:10.162 position:5% line:83% align:start
that she doesn't
want to see right now.

00:10:10.195 --> 00:10:13.198 position:7% line:77% align:start
Still, she was scared
that the other countries
of the 6 party talks

00:10:13.231 --> 00:10:14.932 position:7% line:83% align:start
would examine
the real motivation

00:10:14.965 --> 00:10:17.502 position:7% line:83% align:start
behind the Refugee
Naturalization Policy.

00:10:17.536 --> 00:10:19.271 position:5% line:83% align:start
This entire damn mess
got started

00:10:19.304 --> 00:10:22.808 position:5% line:83% align:start
because she was coerced
into looking after Karam.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.242 position:35% line:83% align:start
That's because even
before General Karam

00:10:25.276 --> 00:10:27.211 position:35% line:83% align:start
chose to seek asylum
here in Japan,

00:10:27.244 --> 00:10:28.380 position:47% line:83% align:start
he threatened
to carry out

00:10:28.413 --> 00:10:30.348 position:47% line:83% align:start
acts of terrorism
in retaliation.

00:10:30.381 --> 00:10:35.186 position:19% line:77% align:start
"At the moment of my death,
I will reap terror
upon the world."

00:10:35.219 --> 00:10:37.288 position:21% line:83% align:start
You mean that
retribution declaration

00:10:37.321 --> 00:10:39.256 position:21% line:83% align:start
in the speech he gave
when Siak fell.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:41.058 position:38% line:83% align:start
Now that we've
learned about this,

00:10:41.092 --> 00:10:43.294 position:33% line:83% align:start
the responsibility for
handling the situation

00:10:43.327 --> 00:10:44.895 position:52% line:89% align:start
falls upon us.

00:10:44.929 --> 00:10:46.597 position:47% line:83% align:start
It's a mystery
how the General's

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:49.233 position:30% line:77% align:start
been able to
issue orders from an
island that's cut off

00:10:49.266 --> 00:10:50.668 position:19% line:89% align:start
from the rest of the world.

00:10:50.701 --> 00:10:52.203 position:35% line:83% align:start
But if we take Karam
into custody,

00:10:52.236 --> 00:10:55.373 position:38% line:77% align:start
maybe we can uncover
all the details
of the plan.

00:10:55.406 --> 00:10:57.341 position:44% line:83% align:start
Also, we'll learn
how far along

00:10:57.375 --> 00:11:00.244 position:44% line:83% align:start
his terrorist plot
is right now.

00:11:00.277 --> 00:11:03.980 position:21% line:77% align:start
Hey, Chief.
I just heard from
the Coast Guard.

00:11:04.013 --> 00:11:05.915 position:21% line:77% align:start
They've opened up
the airspace over
the island.

00:11:05.949 --> 00:11:07.117 position:21% line:89% align:start
We're good to land.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:10.387 position:5% line:83% align:start
Fine. Thank them for me
and take us down at once.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.323 position:5% line:83% align:start
Make sure you doctor
the records of the flight plan.

00:11:13.356 --> 00:11:15.291 position:38% line:89% align:start
Roger that.

00:11:56.598 --> 00:11:59.067 position:5% line:83% align:start
No firearms
or knives detected.

00:11:59.101 --> 00:12:00.803 position:5% line:89% align:start
Clear.

00:12:10.111 --> 00:12:13.981 position:13% line:83% align:start
Proto, turn the power back on
and open the blinds.

00:12:14.015 --> 00:12:15.417 position:55% line:89% align:start
Roger.

00:12:23.224 --> 00:12:25.359 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's wrong?

00:12:25.393 --> 00:12:28.362 position:30% line:89% align:start
Chief...

00:12:31.332 --> 00:12:34.335 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hmm? He looks like
he pulled them out himself.

00:12:37.805 --> 00:12:40.208 position:44% line:89% align:start
This is bad news.

00:12:40.241 --> 00:12:41.676 position:21% line:89% align:start
If he killed himself, too,

00:12:41.709 --> 00:12:44.846 position:19% line:83% align:start
it means that there plan
might already be in motion.

00:12:48.249 --> 00:12:49.817 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's that?

00:12:49.851 --> 00:12:52.286 position:38% line:83% align:start
This? It links up
to the nursing net.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.154 position:21% line:89% align:start
Basically, it's a terminal

00:12:54.187 --> 00:12:57.692 position:30% line:77% align:start
used to exchange
patient's data with
all medical facilities.

00:12:57.725 --> 00:12:59.125 position:47% line:83% align:start
There were rumors
about Karam

00:12:59.159 --> 00:13:01.762 position:19% line:83% align:start
being seriously ill
before he left the country.

00:13:01.796 --> 00:13:04.732 position:19% line:89% align:start
Apparently, they were true.

00:13:04.765 --> 00:13:06.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
So, even though
he was hooked up to that,

00:13:06.868 --> 00:13:08.502 position:27% line:83% align:start
the government
doesn't know he's dead?

00:13:08.535 --> 00:13:10.103 position:61% line:89% align:start
Hmm? Got it.

00:13:10.136 --> 00:13:12.974 position:24% line:83% align:start
He was going through
a backdoor in the system.

00:13:13.006 --> 00:13:15.876 position:27% line:77% align:start
I think there was more
to the good General here
than meets the eye.

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:20.146 position:5% line:77% align:start
Looks that way.
The com log shows that he was
in contact with his people.

00:13:21.414 --> 00:13:23.316 position:41% line:83% align:start
We need to get this
back to HQ

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:24.851 position:27% line:89% align:start
for a thorough analysis.

00:13:24.885 --> 00:13:26.720 position:24% line:83% align:start
But it definitely
appears that they were

00:13:26.753 --> 00:13:29.856 position:16% line:83% align:start
planning a terrorist strike
using a micromachine virus.

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.291 position:5% line:89% align:start
You said were planning?

00:13:32.324 --> 00:13:35.160 position:27% line:77% align:start
When his operatives
began offing themselves
one by one,

00:13:35.194 --> 00:13:37.363 position:38% line:83% align:start
he went and had
a chat with Kagael.

00:13:37.396 --> 00:13:40.299 position:30% line:77% align:start
He questioned whether
they should temporarily
abort the plan.

00:13:40.332 --> 00:13:42.301 position:5% line:89% align:start
What do you mean?

00:13:42.334 --> 00:13:43.737 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you saying
that the suicides

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.805 position:5% line:83% align:start
weren't intended
to be the plots go code?

00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:47.874 position:58% line:89% align:start
I don't know,

00:13:47.908 --> 00:13:49.408 position:30% line:83% align:start
but what
really worries me

00:13:49.441 --> 00:13:51.210 position:24% line:83% align:start
is that there was
a program planted in here

00:13:51.243 --> 00:13:52.946 position:24% line:83% align:start
from the outside
designed to make it look

00:13:52.979 --> 00:13:55.015 position:16% line:89% align:start
as if Karam was still alive.

00:13:55.047 --> 00:13:56.682 position:30% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't be surprised
if the government

00:13:56.715 --> 00:13:58.150 position:30% line:83% align:start
still hasn't
caught on to the fact

00:13:58.183 --> 00:13:59.818 position:16% line:89% align:start
that this fella's long gone.

00:13:59.852 --> 00:14:03.856 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then it's an assassination
disguised as a suicide.

00:14:03.889 --> 00:14:05.524 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah, done by somebody
who doesn't want

00:14:05.558 --> 00:14:07.960 position:24% line:83% align:start
the government to know
that Karam is dead.

00:14:07.993 --> 00:14:10.228 position:33% line:89% align:start
That or...

00:14:10.261 --> 00:14:13.298 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, what about
the micromachine virus?

00:14:13.331 --> 00:14:15.768 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, it looks like
it was sent to the hospital

00:14:15.801 --> 00:14:17.502 position:19% line:89% align:start
of that Mashaba guy.

00:14:17.535 --> 00:14:19.738 position:19% line:83% align:start
Assuming Batou
is not playing hooky,

00:14:19.772 --> 00:14:22.240 position:19% line:83% align:start
he might be able to
recover it for us.

00:14:22.273 --> 00:14:24.609 position:52% line:89% align:start
Hmm? Togusa!

00:14:31.849 --> 00:14:33.851 position:33% line:89% align:start
What the hell is this?

00:14:37.021 --> 00:14:38.323 position:5% line:89% align:start
Puppeteer?

00:14:38.356 --> 00:14:41.593 position:41% line:83% align:start
Azuma, just before
Kagael died,

00:14:41.626 --> 00:14:45.029 position:38% line:77% align:start
do you remember him
saying something
about a puppeteer?

00:14:45.063 --> 00:14:47.999 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come to think of it,
maybe he did.

00:14:48.032 --> 00:14:51.368 position:10% line:83% align:start
The keyword "Puppeteer"
shows up in this log, too.

00:14:51.401 --> 00:14:54.271 position:19% line:77% align:start
It appears
to be the codename
for one of his men.

00:14:54.304 --> 00:14:57.742 position:13% line:83% align:start
We had better apprehend
Mashaba as soon as possible.

00:14:57.775 --> 00:15:00.611 position:44% line:77% align:start
Hmm. I want you
to make a complete
dupe of the vault.

00:15:00.644 --> 00:15:02.245 position:33% line:89% align:start
Go meet up with Batou.

00:15:02.279 --> 00:15:05.482 position:27% line:77% align:start
It's imperative that we
ascertain the full scope
of this plot.

00:15:05.515 --> 00:15:06.783 position:5% line:83% align:start
What do we do
with the stiff?

00:15:06.817 --> 00:15:08.819 position:44% line:83% align:start
Leave things
as we found them.

00:15:08.852 --> 00:15:11.121 position:19% line:83% align:start
I hate having to do that,
but we don't have an option

00:15:11.154 --> 00:15:12.990 position:55% line:83% align:start
since we were
never here.

00:15:13.023 --> 00:15:14.491 position:5% line:89% align:start
Understood

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.165 position:5% line:89% align:start
The hospital.

00:16:03.939 --> 00:16:07.275 position:5% line:83% align:start
That car sticks out
like a sore thumb around here.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.422 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:16:55.456 --> 00:16:59.593 position:5% line:83% align:start
This security system setup
kind of reminds me of...

00:16:59.626 --> 00:17:00.928 position:5% line:89% align:start
[rumbling]

00:17:03.964 --> 00:17:05.666 position:5% line:89% align:start
Head around the outside.

00:17:05.699 --> 00:17:07.301 position:64% line:89% align:start
Roger.

00:17:21.782 --> 00:17:23.617 position:5% line:89% align:start
What the hell?

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:32.226 position:16% line:83% align:start
You can't hack my cyber
brain when I'm in here.

00:17:32.258 --> 00:17:34.928 position:27% line:89% align:start
Die, Puppeteer!

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.615 position:5% line:89% align:start
Must've gone down there.

00:18:09.996 --> 00:18:11.931 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's Batou?

00:18:11.964 --> 00:18:13.565 position:50% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:13.598 --> 00:18:14.533 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:18:16.169 --> 00:18:18.603 position:30% line:89% align:start
What's that thing?

00:18:45.696 --> 00:18:47.032 position:41% line:89% align:start
Get clear!

00:19:01.412 --> 00:19:03.147 position:5% line:89% align:start
You dumb ass!

00:19:06.083 --> 00:19:07.484 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll come back for you later.

00:19:07.518 --> 00:19:08.485 position:5% line:89% align:start
Play dead in the meantime.

00:19:08.519 --> 00:19:09.486 position:69% line:89% align:start
Roger.

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.260 position:19% line:89% align:start
Freeze!

00:19:25.568 --> 00:19:26.636 position:5% line:89% align:start
Major?

00:19:26.669 --> 00:19:29.572 position:35% line:83% align:start
It's been
a long time, Batou.

00:19:29.606 --> 00:19:32.575 position:33% line:83% align:start
So, tell me, what
brings you out here?

00:19:32.609 --> 00:19:33.943 position:5% line:89% align:start
Damn, it is you.

00:19:33.977 --> 00:19:36.779 position:5% line:83% align:start

that the reason you're here

00:21:21.982 --> 00:21:23.550 position:5% line:83% align:start
is because you're
following up on a lead

But let me give you
a bit of friendly advice.

00:21:28.922 --> 00:21:31.359 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't go anywhere near

Neck trauma from

his rampage.

00:22:08.093 --> 00:22:12.297 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess we can rule
Mashaba out as the Puppeteer.

Batou, why the hell
was that thing going

I'd like to find out.

It's possible
that he attacked you

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.176 position:5% line:83% align:start

you were the Puppeteer.

remains speculation
at this point.

reason to believe
it's a rebel's codename.

We also believe
this is the person

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:39.391 position:13% line:83% align:start
who orchestrated the deaths
of the tattooed men in Karam.

He's a super wizard

to commit suicide.

You should come and
see this for yourself.

This is the result

Yeah.

00:27:38.482 --> 00:27:41.218 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then when that robot
went berserk,

00:27:41.251 --> 00:27:44.187 position:5% line:77% align:start
there was no sign
that a third party

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.823 position:35% line:89% align:start
None.

If you say so.

are you implying?

Well, um...

00:27:51.327 --> 00:27:54.030 position:24% line:83% align:start
The truth is
we weren't able

So? Maybe it was stolen.

Judging from
the security system

00:28:02.939 --> 00:28:04.574 position:30% line:89% align:start

that someone else
was there.

was the puppeteer?

Why not?

at this stage.

00:28:23.091 --> 00:28:24.427 position:27% line:83% align:start
But there's
plenty of evidence

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.261 position:27% line:83% align:start
to suggest that
this Puppeteer hacker

00:28:26.294 --> 00:28:28.163 position:27% line:83% align:start
will pick up
where Karam left off.

From here on in,
we will narrow the focus

00:28:42.778 --> 00:28:45.680 position:16% line:83% align:start
You won't do anyone any good
if you're not in top form.

00:28:45.714 --> 00:28:48.383 position:5% line:83% align:start
Gotcha. I can
handle that order.

00:28:50.652 --> 00:28:55.089 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, and Batou...

00:28:55.122 --> 00:28:58.125 position:5% line:77% align:start
This morning,
the chief said,
and I quote,

00:28:58.159 --> 00:29:00.595 position:5% line:83% align:start
"It's about time
you reeled him in."

00:29:00.629 --> 00:29:03.665 position:5% line:77% align:start
You can either
devote yourself full time
as an instructor,

00:29:03.698 --> 00:29:06.934 position:5% line:83% align:start
or you can work under me
on this Puppeteer case.

00:29:06.967 --> 00:29:09.103 position:27% line:83% align:start
I leave the choice
up to you.

00:29:09.136 --> 00:29:11.172 position:27% line:89% align:start
What'll it be?

00:29:16.444 --> 00:29:18.479 position:27% line:89% align:start
Do you even need to ask?

00:29:18.512 --> 00:29:22.149 position:27% line:89% align:start
The Puppeteer job.

00:29:22.183 --> 00:29:24.819 position:38% line:89% align:start
All right, then.

00:29:27.855 --> 00:29:31.692 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I like those cards
a whole lot, too.

00:29:33.159 --> 00:29:34.795 position:21% line:89% align:start
Learn anything?

00:29:34.829 --> 00:29:37.932 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, a few things.

00:29:37.964 --> 00:29:39.667 position:27% line:83% align:start
Cut to the chase
and fill us in.

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.035 position:16% line:83% align:start
First off, I got
the medical results back

00:29:42.068 --> 00:29:44.103 position:16% line:83% align:start
on the 16 kids
we ran checkups on,

00:29:44.137 --> 00:29:47.207 position:16% line:77% align:start
and there were no signs
that they've been
injected with micromachines.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.442 position:16% line:83% align:start
Although, they showed
symptoms of dehydration

00:29:49.476 --> 00:29:50.643 position:13% line:89% align:start
and injuries from past abuse,

00:29:50.677 --> 00:29:52.612 position:13% line:83% align:start
they were all
basically healthy.

00:29:52.645 --> 00:29:54.815 position:35% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:29:54.849 --> 00:29:57.317 position:5% line:83% align:start
but we also found out
that portions of memory

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:58.852 position:5% line:83% align:start
in every child
had been erased.

00:29:58.885 --> 00:30:00.987 position:5% line:83% align:start
In addition, their IDs
had been rewritten

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:03.423 position:5% line:83% align:start
in order to turn them
into somebody else.

00:30:03.456 --> 00:30:06.392 position:24% line:77% align:start
They answered accurately
when asked their
names and addresses,

00:30:06.426 --> 00:30:08.595 position:27% line:83% align:start
but when the topic
turned to their parents,

00:30:08.628 --> 00:30:11.264 position:27% line:83% align:start
they had absolutely
no memories whatsoever.

00:30:11.297 --> 00:30:13.700 position:5% line:83% align:start
And when we went to check out
the addresses they gave,

00:30:13.733 --> 00:30:15.300 position:5% line:83% align:start
they were only
elderly people

00:30:15.334 --> 00:30:16.736 position:5% line:83% align:start
who had been
living alone for years.

00:30:16.769 --> 00:30:19.204 position:21% line:83% align:start
Maybe those people
really are their parents.

00:30:19.238 --> 00:30:20.507 position:5% line:89% align:start
Not likely.

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:21.774 position:5% line:83% align:start
We saw everything
from a woman

00:30:21.808 --> 00:30:23.977 position:5% line:83% align:start
living by herself
in a 10x8 room

00:30:24.009 --> 00:30:26.980 position:5% line:77% align:start
to a rich old fart
who could afford
his own nursing robots.

00:30:27.012 --> 00:30:29.181 position:5% line:83% align:start
But what each and every
one of them had in common

00:30:29.214 --> 00:30:31.283 position:5% line:83% align:start
was that they were
hooked up to the nursing system,

00:30:31.316 --> 00:30:34.052 position:5% line:83% align:start
and they were all
noble rot senior citizens.

00:30:34.086 --> 00:30:36.054 position:5% line:83% align:start
Needless to say,
there were no signs

00:30:36.088 --> 00:30:38.290 position:5% line:83% align:start
that any children
had ever lived there.

00:30:38.323 --> 00:30:39.625 position:5% line:83% align:start
We examined
the registry ledgers,

00:30:39.658 --> 00:30:42.561 position:5% line:83% align:start
and "child" was listed
next to each name.

00:30:42.594 --> 00:30:45.364 position:5% line:83% align:start
Those were undoubtedly
doctored, too.

00:30:45.397 --> 00:30:47.566 position:16% line:83% align:start
What is this noble rot
you're talking about?

00:30:47.599 --> 00:30:51.336 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's a reference to the fully
automatic nursing system.

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:53.672 position:24% line:83% align:start
It provides minimum
treatment to the elderly

00:30:53.705 --> 00:30:54.873 position:24% line:89% align:start
who are hooked up to it.

00:30:54.907 --> 00:30:56.775 position:24% line:83% align:start
They lie there,
languishing like grapes

00:30:56.808 --> 00:30:59.778 position:24% line:83% align:start
infested with noble rot,
shriveling on the vine.

00:30:59.811 --> 00:31:02.246 position:5% line:83% align:start
It was originally developed
with the intent of solving

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.248 position:5% line:89% align:start
the aging population problem,

00:31:04.282 --> 00:31:07.953 position:5% line:77% align:start
and at the same time,
to prevent the aged from
dying alone and unnoticed.

00:31:07.986 --> 00:31:10.121 position:19% line:83% align:start
But when NPOs learned
that it was

00:31:10.154 --> 00:31:12.223 position:19% line:83% align:start
encouraging patients
to remain bedridden

00:31:12.256 --> 00:31:13.457 position:19% line:89% align:start
by connecting to the net,

00:31:13.491 --> 00:31:15.760 position:19% line:83% align:start
they started rebuking it
as a thinly disguised

00:31:15.793 --> 00:31:17.628 position:19% line:89% align:start
asset collection process.

00:31:17.662 --> 00:31:18.896 position:5% line:89% align:start
You know this?

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:20.898 position:30% line:83% align:start
I've heard all about it
from the old ladies

00:31:20.932 --> 00:31:22.900 position:30% line:83% align:start
who come to
my pachinko place.

00:31:22.934 --> 00:31:24.835 position:38% line:83% align:start
It's sort of like
the bare bones model

00:31:24.869 --> 00:31:27.471 position:38% line:83% align:start
that was next
to Karam's bed.

00:31:27.505 --> 00:31:29.740 position:19% line:89% align:start
Now, wait a minute here.

00:31:29.774 --> 00:31:32.476 position:19% line:83% align:start
Kagael was trying to
create human bombs, right?

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:34.545 position:19% line:83% align:start
If that's true, why did
he go to the trouble

00:31:34.579 --> 00:31:37.048 position:19% line:83% align:start
of erasing the kids'
memories of their parents.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.149 position:19% line:83% align:start
If he wanted them
to remain inconspicuous

00:31:39.182 --> 00:31:41.052 position:19% line:83% align:start
after he infected them
with the virus,

00:31:41.084 --> 00:31:43.086 position:19% line:83% align:start
why wouldn't he
send the kids back home

00:31:43.119 --> 00:31:45.121 position:19% line:83% align:start
after erasing the memories
of their abduction?

00:31:45.155 --> 00:31:46.958 position:35% line:83% align:start
You're asking
the wrong guy.

00:31:46.991 --> 00:31:49.125 position:5% line:83% align:start
You definitely
have a point there.

00:31:49.159 --> 00:31:51.394 position:5% line:83% align:start
And if he cyberized them
just for his plan,

00:31:51.428 --> 00:31:53.229 position:5% line:83% align:start
he's sure going to
a lot of trouble.

00:31:53.263 --> 00:31:57.000 position:21% line:77% align:start
The operations
seem to have been done
prior to the abductions.

00:31:57.033 --> 00:31:58.935 position:21% line:83% align:start
The transformers
seem legit, too.

00:31:58.969 --> 00:32:01.237 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then the Ministry of
Health, Labor, and Welfare

00:32:01.271 --> 00:32:02.739 position:5% line:89% align:start
ought to have records.

00:32:02.772 --> 00:32:04.841 position:5% line:83% align:start
Since all of those children
are 6 years old,

00:32:04.874 --> 00:32:07.176 position:5% line:83% align:start
a consent form signed
by a parent or guardian

00:32:07.209 --> 00:32:10.112 position:5% line:89% align:start
is a legal requirement.

00:32:10.145 --> 00:32:12.816 position:33% line:83% align:start
There are 144
missing ampoules.

00:32:14.718 --> 00:32:17.020 position:27% line:77% align:start
We should check to see
if there are any
kids listed there

00:32:17.053 --> 00:32:18.722 position:27% line:83% align:start
who fit
the same descriptions.

00:32:18.755 --> 00:32:20.890 position:27% line:83% align:start
We've gotta make sure
we cover all the bases.

00:32:20.924 --> 00:32:23.325 position:5% line:89% align:start
Good call.

00:32:58.093 --> 00:33:01.162 position:19% line:83% align:start
All right,
if the 16 kids we rescued

00:33:01.195 --> 00:33:04.066 position:30% line:77% align:start
had their cyberization
surgery done through
legitimate channels,

00:33:04.099 --> 00:33:06.367 position:30% line:77% align:start
then the records
would have been
automatically recorded

00:33:06.401 --> 00:33:10.004 position:16% line:83% align:start
in the databases of the MHLW
and the management ministry.

00:33:10.038 --> 00:33:12.540 position:19% line:83% align:start
Let's assume that they
were snatched afterwards,

00:33:12.573 --> 00:33:14.308 position:30% line:83% align:start
and their family
registries altered

00:33:14.342 --> 00:33:17.412 position:30% line:77% align:start
to make them look like
they were the children
of those old folks.

00:33:17.445 --> 00:33:20.915 position:21% line:77% align:start
There'd be a discrepancy
between the number of kids
listed as cyberized

00:33:20.948 --> 00:33:25.218 position:16% line:83% align:start
in the national ID database
and that listed by the MHLW.

00:33:25.252 --> 00:33:26.420 position:5% line:89% align:start
I follow.

00:33:26.453 --> 00:33:28.690 position:5% line:83% align:start
All of the children claim
to have the same last name

00:33:28.723 --> 00:33:31.358 position:5% line:83% align:start
as one of those seniors,
so it should be simple to spot.

00:33:34.162 --> 00:33:35.129 position:30% line:89% align:start
20,000?

00:33:35.163 --> 00:33:38.032 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's gotta
be a mistake.

00:33:38.066 --> 00:33:40.634 position:5% line:83% align:start
If kids were being swiped
in such huge numbers,

00:33:40.667 --> 00:33:42.235 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think somebody
would've noticed it.

00:33:42.269 --> 00:33:44.371 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yeah, you're right.

00:33:44.404 --> 00:33:47.240 position:33% line:77% align:start
Besides, that numbers
way larger than
anything we expected.

00:33:47.274 --> 00:33:49.042 position:50% line:89% align:start
What now?

00:33:49.076 --> 00:33:52.245 position:21% line:77% align:start
Let's begin by eliminating
the worst case scenario.

00:33:52.279 --> 00:33:54.648 position:24% line:83% align:start
First, we ascertain
the names and addresses

00:33:54.681 --> 00:33:56.683 position:24% line:83% align:start
of the excess children
in the database.

00:33:56.717 --> 00:33:57.818 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm on it.

00:33:57.851 --> 00:34:00.520 position:5% line:83% align:start

in a few seconds.

00:35:33.443 --> 00:35:35.746 position:21% line:83% align:start
Common sense dictates that
Kagael's crew couldn't

00:35:35.779 --> 00:35:38.283 position:24% line:83% align:start
possibly have carried out
that many kidnappings.

00:35:38.315 --> 00:35:40.118 position:47% line:83% align:start
Even if we were
to tell ourselves

00:35:40.151 --> 00:35:42.220 position:21% line:83% align:start
that it's the work of this
hacker, The Puppeteer,

00:35:42.253 --> 00:35:45.422 position:50% line:83% align:start
the M.O. is
just too sloppy.

00:35:45.455 --> 00:35:47.157 position:35% line:83% align:start
Don't you find it
the least bit strange

00:35:47.191 --> 00:35:49.159 position:13% line:83% align:start
that this guy would leave
traces of tampering

00:35:49.193 --> 00:35:51.562 position:38% line:83% align:start
only in the National
I.D. System?

00:35:51.595 --> 00:35:53.864 position:27% line:83% align:start
This way, it's almost
as if he's saying to us,

00:35:53.897 --> 00:35:56.365 position:27% line:83% align:start
"I've nabbed these kids,
now please find them."

00:35:56.399 --> 00:35:58.802 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, for what it's worth,
I'll throw in my two cents.

00:35:58.836 --> 00:36:01.839 position:47% line:77% align:start
I think he's got
something else
in mind entirely.

00:36:01.872 --> 00:36:03.606 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:36:03.639 --> 00:36:05.675 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have to concur
with your opinion.

00:36:05.708 --> 00:36:08.711 position:58% line:89% align:start
Chief?

00:36:18.322 --> 00:36:22.225 position:7% line:83% align:start
These were sent to the MHLW's
Pathogenic Microorganism

00:36:22.259 --> 00:36:23.826 position:21% line:89% align:start
Isolation Facility.

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.029 position:16% line:77% align:start
Analysis pegged
them as a Siak-produced
micromachine virus.

00:36:27.063 --> 00:36:30.666 position:7% line:83% align:start
This would suggest that
our intel was indeed correct.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:32.735 position:10% line:83% align:start
What did the person
who delivered it look like?

00:36:32.768 --> 00:36:35.838 position:21% line:83% align:start
There are absolutely
no records remaining

00:36:35.872 --> 00:36:38.673 position:30% line:77% align:start
that might have offered
a clue as to who
delivered it, or when.

00:36:38.708 --> 00:36:40.575 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is there a chance

00:36:40.609 --> 00:36:42.644 position:5% line:83% align:start
that this person
is The Puppeteer?

00:36:42.677 --> 00:36:44.247 position:55% line:89% align:start
It's possible.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.580 position:21% line:89% align:start
If that's the case,

00:36:45.614 --> 00:36:48.650 position:19% line:83% align:start
what's The Puppeteer's
ultimate goal here?

00:36:48.683 --> 00:36:51.254 position:7% line:83% align:start
It couldn't be to keep
Karam's terrorist plot rolling.

00:36:51.287 --> 00:36:54.623 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hmm. There's a possibility
that the Puppeteer

00:36:54.656 --> 00:36:57.959 position:21% line:77% align:start
is a hacker, operating
under the authority
of some government agency.

00:36:57.993 --> 00:36:59.427 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?

00:36:59.461 --> 00:37:01.529 position:50% line:83% align:start
The way in which
Karam's death

00:37:01.563 --> 00:37:04.299 position:27% line:83% align:start
was so deftly covered up
has been nagging at me.

00:37:04.332 --> 00:37:06.534 position:35% line:83% align:start
As I was trying
to find some answers,

00:37:06.568 --> 00:37:08.904 position:24% line:83% align:start
I heard rumors of
a suspicious conversation

00:37:08.937 --> 00:37:11.139 position:21% line:83% align:start
that took place recently
between the prime minister

00:37:11.172 --> 00:37:13.275 position:30% line:83% align:start
and the foreign affairs
ministry.

00:37:13.308 --> 00:37:16.410 position:30% line:77% align:start
You believe the foreign
ministry used a hacker
to assassinate Karam,

00:37:16.443 --> 00:37:19.014 position:33% line:77% align:start
because he was
such a big thorn in
the government's side?

00:37:19.047 --> 00:37:21.448 position:10% line:89% align:start
To be perfectly blunt, yes.

00:37:21.482 --> 00:37:23.651 position:5% line:83% align:start
In that case, we should
probably start thinking

00:37:23.684 --> 00:37:26.254 position:5% line:83% align:start
of the kidnappings
as a decoy.

00:37:26.288 --> 00:37:29.823 position:5% line:83% align:start
So? Which section was it
that took the job?

00:37:29.857 --> 00:37:33.761 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, this incident does not
amount to a serious crime.

00:37:33.794 --> 00:37:35.963 position:16% line:83% align:start
Nevertheless, if we take
into consideration

00:37:35.996 --> 00:37:38.132 position:5% line:83% align:start
the results that it's achieved,
the government and we

00:37:38.165 --> 00:37:39.800 position:19% line:89% align:start
are on the same page.

00:37:39.833 --> 00:37:41.635 position:16% line:83% align:start
For now, the best advice
I can offer

00:37:41.669 --> 00:37:43.938 position:19% line:83% align:start
is that we should
let sleeping dogs lie

00:37:43.971 --> 00:37:46.307 position:13% line:83% align:start
and avoid making
the situation even worse.

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.609 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hmm?
What?

00:37:48.642 --> 00:37:51.712 position:21% line:77% align:start
You are to identify
the 16 children
as soon as possible,

00:37:51.745 --> 00:37:53.414 position:19% line:89% align:start
but you finish there.

00:37:53.446 --> 00:37:57.384 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm temporarily taking you
off the investigation.

for nothing,

00:38:06.492 --> 00:38:10.230 position:10% line:83% align:start
and now we've got to tie up
an assload of loose ends.

00:38:10.264 --> 00:38:12.966 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, the least we can do
is jump on the task at hand,

00:38:12.999 --> 00:38:15.735 position:21% line:83% align:start
and track down
the parents of those kids.

00:38:25.378 --> 00:38:27.680 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry I'm late.
I'm on my way there.

[alarm chirping]

00:38:45.063 --> 00:38:47.200 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:38:55.741 --> 00:38:57.709 position:61% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:38:57.743 --> 00:38:59.678 position:5% line:89% align:start
Need to ask you something.

00:38:59.711 --> 00:39:02.447 position:64% line:89% align:start
What is it?

00:39:02.481 --> 00:39:04.282 position:5% line:83% align:start
Who made you pull us
off this case?

00:39:04.316 --> 00:39:07.651 position:5% line:83% align:start
Was it the Treaty Review
Department?

00:39:07.685 --> 00:39:11.957 position:35% line:83% align:start
You mean that. I cut
a deal with Nakamura.

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:14.159 position:30% line:83% align:start
In exchange for turning
a blind eye

00:39:14.192 --> 00:39:16.428 position:21% line:83% align:start
to their work, we were
allowed to take possession

00:39:16.461 --> 00:39:18.096 position:21% line:89% align:start
of the micromachine virus.

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:19.864 position:21% line:89% align:start
And you're okay with that?

00:39:19.897 --> 00:39:23.402 position:5% line:77% align:start
If removing Karam from
the picture was so vital
to national interests,

00:39:23.435 --> 00:39:25.136 position:5% line:83% align:start
I would think you'd be
offended that they didn't

00:39:25.169 --> 00:39:27.406 position:5% line:89% align:start
ask us to do it.

00:39:27.439 --> 00:39:28.839 position:5% line:89% align:start
Otherwise, what was the point

00:39:28.873 --> 00:39:32.109 position:5% line:83% align:start
of expanding Section 9
these past two years?

00:39:32.143 --> 00:39:33.512 position:5% line:89% align:start
She's not going to come back.

00:39:33.544 --> 00:39:37.581 position:5% line:89% align:start
Not when we're like this.

00:39:37.615 --> 00:39:39.817 position:35% line:83% align:start
So what do we do,
wallow in regret

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:41.052 position:35% line:83% align:start
for not receiving
such an order,

00:39:41.085 --> 00:39:42.353 position:35% line:89% align:start
or do we rejoice?

00:39:42.386 --> 00:39:44.221 position:27% line:83% align:start
The answer to that
will determine what path

00:39:44.255 --> 00:39:46.556 position:33% line:89% align:start
we walk in the future.

00:39:46.589 --> 00:39:49.994 position:30% line:77% align:start
I completely understand
the point you're trying
to make, Batou.

00:39:50.027 --> 00:39:52.463 position:24% line:83% align:start
But we must also consider
the possibility

00:39:52.496 --> 00:39:55.166 position:21% line:83% align:start
that the Major will
never return to Section 9.

00:39:55.199 --> 00:39:57.934 position:35% line:83% align:start

more rare than E.S.P.

Unfortunate though it may be,

In reality being
what it is,

00:40:04.908 --> 00:40:06.943 position:19% line:83% align:start
I won't be able
to stay here forever.

00:40:06.976 --> 00:40:09.012 position:55% line:83% align:start
So, under the
circumstances,

00:40:09.045 --> 00:40:11.314 position:41% line:83% align:start
shouldn't we create
a new organization?

00:40:11.347 --> 00:40:14.518 position:21% line:83% align:start
A unit that can tackle not
just one investigation,

00:40:14.552 --> 00:40:18.188 position:38% line:77% align:start
but three at a time,
while using only 80%
of its resources.

00:40:18.221 --> 00:40:20.223 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't you think that's
the best way to carry on

00:40:20.256 --> 00:40:22.125 position:16% line:89% align:start
our ideals after we're gone.

00:40:22.158 --> 00:40:24.194 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's what I hoped
for as I worked

00:40:24.227 --> 00:40:26.029 position:19% line:83% align:start
to expand our current
organization.

00:40:26.062 --> 00:40:29.898 position:16% line:77% align:start
Making Togusa the squad
commander was part
of that plan,

00:40:29.933 --> 00:40:33.036 position:10% line:83% align:start
but, if you had accepted the
position instead of him,

00:40:33.069 --> 00:40:36.139 position:16% line:83% align:start
then things might have
worked out differently.

00:40:36.172 --> 00:40:38.740 position:16% line:83% align:start
Old man, I ain't cut out
for a job like that.

00:40:38.774 --> 00:40:41.743 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you subjectively believe
that to be the case,

00:40:41.777 --> 00:40:43.513 position:13% line:89% align:start
you might be correct then.

00:40:43.546 --> 00:40:45.814 position:10% line:89% align:start
With Togusa it's different.

00:40:45.848 --> 00:40:48.717 position:21% line:83% align:start
Before a person's
talents can blossom,

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:52.321 position:13% line:83% align:start
one has to overcome
a whole slew of obstacles.

00:40:52.354 --> 00:40:55.724 position:10% line:83% align:start

want you to give it to him.

00:40:55.757 --> 00:40:57.726 position:27% line:89% align:start
Are you sure about that?

00:40:57.759 --> 00:41:00.996 position:30% line:77% align:start

doing a bang-up

the prosthetics he got,

that she had to
be the Puppeteer.

00:45:45.673 --> 00:45:48.409 position:16% line:83% align:start
like the Major might be
involved in a specific case,

00:45:48.442 --> 00:45:51.813 position:30% line:77% align:start

believed that she

was you were gunning for,

and why you were
trying to kill him?

01:02:01.923 --> 01:02:05.193 position:21% line:83% align:start
It was to avenge
the general's death.

It was a tip that I got
from a double agent.

01:02:19.407 --> 01:02:22.343 position:5% line:77% align:start
He said he'd tell me
who masterminded the

01:02:22.377 --> 01:02:24.978 position:5% line:83% align:start

the Major

01:05:24.185 --> 01:05:26.722 position:5% line:83% align:start
might not be the
Puppeteer after all.

Raj Poot claims that the

of an abduction mechanism
that's built into the

An abduction mechanism?

01:05:34.462 --> 01:05:35.965 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's right.

01:05:35.998 --> 01:05:40.101 position:5% line:77% align:start

referred to the nursing net
as the Solid State

01:05:40.135 --> 01:05:42.905 position:5% line:83% align:start

I should have
mentioned this before.

01:05:45.106 --> 01:05:46.374 position:5% line:83% align:start
But when I ran
into the Major,

01:05:46.408 --> 01:05:50.545 position:5% line:83% align:start
she told me to stay away

but I think what she was
really trying to tell me

01:05:54.316 --> 01:05:55.717 position:5% line:89% align:start
was to stay away from her.

01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:59.354 position:5% line:77% align:start

me a heads up to avoid
the nursing net.

01:05:59.387 --> 01:06:02.257 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm guessing that Karam and

tried to exploit

Puppeteer, huh?

01:07:07.887 --> 01:07:09.222 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's your plan?

01:07:09.255 --> 01:07:11.257 position:24% line:83% align:start
How do the missing
kids fit into it?

01:07:11.290 --> 01:07:13.426 position:19% line:83% align:start
Where did those 20,000
children disappear to?

01:07:13.459 --> 01:07:15.328 position:5% line:83% align:start
We are doing nothing more
than recycling ghosts

01:07:15.361 --> 01:07:19.164 position:5% line:83% align:start
that have been foolishly
allowed to go to waste.

01:07:19.197 --> 01:07:21.668 position:5% line:83% align:start
I am about to let you
experience for yourself

01:07:21.701 --> 01:07:23.803 position:5% line:83% align:start
exactly what some
of them went through.

01:07:31.911 --> 01:07:35.748 position:5% line:83% align:start
Batou, I have a fix
on Togusa's location.

01:07:35.782 --> 01:07:39.751 position:16% line:77% align:start
He's at the cyber brain
surgical hospital over
in Kohokoni town.

01:07:50.095 --> 01:07:51.830 position:30% line:89% align:start
Now I get it.

01:07:51.863 --> 01:07:53.432 position:24% line:83% align:start
The kids are taken
to the hospital

01:07:53.465 --> 01:07:55.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
by their own parents
for cyberization.

01:07:55.767 --> 01:07:59.438 position:5% line:83% align:start
The doctors perform the surgery
without suspecting a thing.

01:07:59.471 --> 01:08:01.873 position:24% line:83% align:start
You then override
a child's memory.

01:08:01.907 --> 01:08:04.508 position:13% line:83% align:start
The parent drops off the
kid with a senior citizen

01:08:04.543 --> 01:08:06.410 position:24% line:83% align:start
and the abduction
is complete.

01:08:06.444 --> 01:08:09.313 position:16% line:83% align:start
After this, you're
going to wipe my memory

01:08:09.346 --> 01:08:12.751 position:16% line:83% align:start
and my own daughter will
vanish like the others.

01:08:16.021 --> 01:08:19.690 position:16% line:77% align:start
You shouldn't feel
regret about your
memories being altered.

01:08:19.724 --> 01:08:21.126 position:16% line:83% align:start
In modern society,
memories are constantly

01:08:21.159 --> 01:08:25.529 position:16% line:83% align:start
modified
on a subconscious level.

01:08:25.563 --> 01:08:28.399 position:19% line:83% align:start
The probability
of such modifications

01:08:28.432 --> 01:08:30.668 position:7% line:83% align:start
already exceeds that of being
in a traffic accident.

01:08:45.049 --> 01:08:47.184 position:27% line:83% align:start
Am I being given
a choose then?

01:09:03.134 --> 01:09:04.067 position:33% line:89% align:start
There it is.

01:09:16.378 --> 01:09:18.447 position:19% line:83% align:start
I won't let you people
take my daughter.

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.983 position:41% line:89% align:start
Never.

01:09:28.992 --> 01:09:30.659 position:21% line:89% align:start
Listen, sweetheart,

01:09:30.692 --> 01:09:33.930 position:13% line:83% align:start
I need you to do something
very important for Daddy.

01:09:33.963 --> 01:09:35.999 position:27% line:83% align:start
When Daddy let's
go of your hand,

01:09:36.032 --> 01:09:38.101 position:21% line:83% align:start
you run away
as fast as you can.

01:09:38.134 --> 01:09:40.170 position:58% line:89% align:start
Run away?

01:09:40.203 --> 01:09:41.303 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's right.

01:09:41.336 --> 01:09:42.504 position:16% line:89% align:start
You'll hear a loud bang,

01:09:42.538 --> 01:09:44.573 position:21% line:83% align:start
just like the field
games at school.

01:09:44.606 --> 01:09:45.808 position:5% line:89% align:start
When you hear that sound,

01:09:45.841 --> 01:09:47.810 position:5% line:89% align:start
run with all your might.

01:09:47.843 --> 01:09:50.479 position:5% line:83% align:start
After you start running,
don't stop for anything.

01:09:50.512 --> 01:09:54.082 position:24% line:83% align:start
Whatever you do,
do not look back.

01:09:54.116 --> 01:09:56.552 position:30% line:89% align:start
Can you do it?

01:09:56.585 --> 01:09:57.719 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

01:09:57.753 --> 01:09:58.954 position:5% line:89% align:start
Good girl.

01:09:58.987 --> 01:10:00.856 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now close your eyes.

01:10:03.759 --> 01:10:05.861 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

01:10:05.894 --> 01:10:08.197 position:27% line:83% align:start
This is goodbye,
my angel.

01:10:19.208 --> 01:10:21.008 position:83% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:10:21.042 --> 01:10:22.910 position:38% line:89% align:start
Togusa!

01:10:29.817 --> 01:10:31.319 position:55% line:89% align:start
I love you.

01:10:34.354 --> 01:10:35.823 position:38% line:89% align:start
Togusa!

01:11:03.917 --> 01:11:05.418 position:30% line:89% align:start
Max, Wasashi.

01:11:08.454 --> 01:11:09.756 position:21% line:89% align:start
Now don't you worry.

01:11:09.789 --> 01:11:11.157 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's okay.

01:11:18.631 --> 01:11:19.833 position:41% line:89% align:start
Major?

01:11:19.866 --> 01:11:23.535 position:30% line:83% align:start
I had to wait until the
last possible second.

01:11:23.569 --> 01:11:24.971 position:47% line:89% align:start
Sorry about that.

01:11:25.005 --> 01:11:28.407 position:10% line:83% align:start
Then I guess this means that
you aren't the Puppeteer.

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.243 position:21% line:89% align:start
Where have you been?

01:11:33.579 --> 01:11:35.814 position:58% line:89% align:start
Daddy.

01:11:37.549 --> 01:11:39.785 position:27% line:83% align:start
I've kept busy
since Section 9.

01:11:39.818 --> 01:11:41.120 position:10% line:89% align:start
I've been wandering the net,

01:11:41.153 --> 01:11:42.788 position:16% line:83% align:start
covertly solving crimes
that can't be handled

01:11:42.821 --> 01:11:46.992 position:24% line:77% align:start
with standard
organization-based
methodology.

01:11:47.026 --> 01:11:48.994 position:5% line:83% align:start
In the course
of doing that,

01:11:49.028 --> 01:11:50.461 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Major]
I came across these
abduction cases

01:11:50.495 --> 01:11:53.399 position:5% line:83% align:start
and I've been conducting
my own investigation.

01:11:56.567 --> 01:11:59.371 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can't believe that you
would use Togusa as bait.

01:11:59.405 --> 01:12:02.440 position:5% line:77% align:start
Didn't you stop to think
that it might put his
family in their crosshairs?

01:12:02.473 --> 01:12:03.441 position:38% line:83% align:start
There were
safeguards in place,

01:12:03.474 --> 01:12:05.044 position:44% line:89% align:start
I made sure of it.

01:12:05.077 --> 01:12:08.546 position:16% line:71% align:start
Thanks to those, we should
be able to learn now who the
Puppeteer really is.

01:12:08.579 --> 01:12:09.547 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:11.916 position:5% line:83% align:start
Isn't Puppeteer the
name of a system

01:12:11.950 --> 01:12:13.651 position:5% line:83% align:start
that's operating
on the nursing net?

01:12:13.685 --> 01:12:17.055 position:13% line:77% align:start
Instead of a system, it would
be more accurate to call
it a gestalt,

01:12:17.088 --> 01:12:19.524 position:41% line:83% align:start
those hooked up
to the nursing net,

01:12:19.557 --> 01:12:21.592 position:47% line:83% align:start
meaning all those
senior citizens.

01:12:21.626 --> 01:12:23.528 position:19% line:83% align:start
But there's a hub cyber
brain running independently

01:12:23.561 --> 01:12:25.830 position:47% line:83% align:start
that manages
the entire thing.

01:12:25.863 --> 01:12:28.232 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hub cyber brain?

01:12:36.007 --> 01:12:37.874 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey, are those
what I think they are?

01:12:37.909 --> 01:12:43.181 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Major]
I constructed them out of data
I found drifting in the net.

01:12:43.214 --> 01:12:45.582 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hi, Miss Kuboto,
long time no see.

01:12:45.615 --> 01:12:48.051 position:35% line:83% align:start
It's nice to see that
you're doing well.

01:12:48.085 --> 01:12:50.187 position:5% line:83% align:start
A back door was installed
in the nursing net

01:12:50.221 --> 01:12:53.290 position:5% line:83% align:start
that's been there ever
since the design stage.

01:12:53.324 --> 01:12:55.726 position:5% line:89% align:start
Look.

01:12:55.759 --> 01:12:57.694 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is the full view
of the rhizome

01:12:57.728 --> 01:13:01.732 position:5% line:83% align:start
that's been woven by those
elderly people's gestalt.

01:13:01.765 --> 01:13:04.533 position:5% line:83% align:start
A Rhizome doesn't contain
the concept of a center.

01:13:04.567 --> 01:13:07.704 position:5% line:83% align:start
Therefore the hub's cyber
brain is constantly in motion.

01:13:07.738 --> 01:13:09.973 position:5% line:83% align:start
That, or the
Rhizome itself

01:13:10.007 --> 01:13:12.175 position:5% line:83% align:start
might be acting
as a hub.

01:13:16.279 --> 01:13:18.048 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now that I know
what's going on,

01:13:18.081 --> 01:13:20.716 position:21% line:83% align:start
I gotta find out who
or what this hub is.

01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:25.188 position:19% line:83% align:start
Max, Wasashi,
report your findings.

01:13:25.222 --> 01:13:27.623 position:21% line:89% align:start
What's the problem?

01:13:27.656 --> 01:13:30.494 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well,
you see, um--

01:13:30.526 --> 01:13:32.228 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't know how to
break this to you, Major.

01:13:32.261 --> 01:13:35.998 position:5% line:89% align:start
You failed?

01:13:36.032 --> 01:13:39.435 position:5% line:77% align:start
But we did succeed
in pinpointing it's
location though.

01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:43.039 position:33% line:83% align:start
Okay, where
is it then?

01:13:43.072 --> 01:13:45.908 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's at the Sacred Citizen
Relief Center Building.

01:13:45.941 --> 01:13:49.644 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's where the heart of
the nursing net is located.

01:14:08.397 --> 01:14:09.465 position:50% line:89% align:start
They've arrived.

01:14:18.339 --> 01:14:21.409 position:5% line:83% align:start

time, Major.

01:14:21.443 --> 01:14:23.945 position:5% line:89% align:start
I suppose it has.

01:14:26.114 --> 01:14:28.550 position:13% line:83% align:start
Too bad we have to reunite
under these circumstances.

01:14:32.653 --> 01:14:33.854 position:44% line:89% align:start
Why?

01:14:33.887 --> 01:14:35.090 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why did you come back?

01:14:36.957 --> 01:14:37.925 position:30% line:89% align:start
That can wait.

01:14:37.958 --> 01:14:39.726 position:21% line:89% align:start
There's no time now.

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:43.298 position:10% line:83% align:start
At the moment, our priority
is to catch the Puppeteer.

01:14:45.732 --> 01:14:47.368 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hitoshi Munei,

01:14:47.402 --> 01:14:49.403 position:21% line:83% align:start
assemblyman
in the lower house.

01:14:49.437 --> 01:14:52.239 position:10% line:83% align:start
The reason why he was marked
for death is our sole lead

01:14:52.272 --> 01:14:54.308 position:13% line:83% align:start
in uncovering the true
identity of the Puppeteer.

01:14:54.341 --> 01:14:58.378 position:5% line:77% align:start
This man Munei
is a reactionary
conservative nationalist

01:14:58.412 --> 01:14:59.880 position:5% line:83% align:start
who's always
been a proponent

01:14:59.913 --> 01:15:01.714 position:5% line:83% align:start
of the formation
of a ruling class.

01:15:01.747 --> 01:15:04.650 position:5% line:83% align:start
One comprised of
pure blooded Japanese.

01:15:04.684 --> 01:15:07.321 position:5% line:83% align:start
He's always in contact
with the Foreign Ministry,

01:15:07.354 --> 01:15:10.524 position:5% line:83% align:start
and he has ties to
the Treaty Review Department.

01:15:10.557 --> 01:15:13.726 position:21% line:83% align:start
He was also involved
in Karam's murder.

01:15:13.759 --> 01:15:15.562 position:5% line:89% align:start
What are you saying, Major?

01:15:15.596 --> 01:15:18.599 position:13% line:83% align:start
I contracted out to
the Treaty Review Department

01:15:18.631 --> 01:15:21.634 position:16% line:77% align:start
so that I could
make it look as if Karam
had been assassinated,

01:15:21.667 --> 01:15:24.337 position:16% line:83% align:start
but before I could do it,
the Puppeteer got to him.

01:15:24.371 --> 01:15:26.005 position:35% line:83% align:start
Then you were
only responsible

01:15:26.038 --> 01:15:29.642 position:24% line:83% align:start
for covering up his death
after the fact.

01:15:29.675 --> 01:15:31.612 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, more or less.

01:15:33.246 --> 01:15:35.081 position:50% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

01:15:35.114 --> 01:15:37.283 position:30% line:83% align:start
We've also learned
that Hitoshi Munei

01:15:37.316 --> 01:15:38.951 position:30% line:83% align:start
has secured
a leadership position

01:15:38.985 --> 01:15:40.386 position:16% line:89% align:start
in the day to day operations

[Batou]
What's in it for him?

01:15:43.623 --> 01:15:45.625 position:5% line:83% align:start
The place is just
a service organization

01:15:45.657 --> 01:15:48.793 position:5% line:77% align:start
that provides healthcare
and vocational training

01:15:48.827 --> 01:15:51.730 position:27% line:83% align:start
True. However,
thanks to the patronage

01:15:51.763 --> 01:15:53.232 position:27% line:89% align:start
of certain politicians,

01:15:53.266 --> 01:15:56.101 position:19% line:83% align:start
and it's public image
as a non-profit foundation,

01:15:56.134 --> 01:16:00.305 position:19% line:77% align:start
the Center acts in reality
as a training facility
servicing the power elite.

01:16:00.339 --> 01:16:03.609 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's a veritable
brainwashing factory.

01:16:03.643 --> 01:16:06.211 position:38% line:83% align:start
That has to be
what Raj Poot meant

01:16:06.244 --> 01:16:08.780 position:41% line:77% align:start
when he implied
that the government
had a part in it.

01:16:08.813 --> 01:16:12.384 position:10% line:77% align:start
If this place is
being used as a temporary
central cleaning house

01:16:12.417 --> 01:16:14.052 position:10% line:83% align:start
for those children
who were abducted,

01:16:14.085 --> 01:16:16.388 position:10% line:83% align:start
then what the Puppeteer
is having trouble dealing with

01:16:16.421 --> 01:16:18.323 position:10% line:83% align:start
is the fact
that Munei is using it

01:16:18.356 --> 01:16:20.225 position:10% line:89% align:start
as a brainwashing factory.

01:16:20.258 --> 01:16:23.761 position:5% line:83% align:start
Chief, why don't
we go search the place?

01:16:23.794 --> 01:16:27.299 position:5% line:77% align:start
Our top priority here
is to find those
missing children.

01:16:27.332 --> 01:16:30.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but raiding the place
will cause a scandal.

01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:32.937 position:16% line:83% align:start
And if that happens,
that scumbag of a politician

01:16:32.970 --> 01:16:35.607 position:27% line:83% align:start
ain't the only one who's
gonna catch heat for it.

01:16:40.411 --> 01:16:42.681 position:19% line:89% align:start
Ishikawa, how's it coming?

01:16:42.713 --> 01:16:45.216 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is that you, Major?

01:16:45.249 --> 01:16:48.687 position:5% line:77% align:start
Heh. You picked
a hell of a time
to rejoin the fold.

01:16:48.719 --> 01:16:51.355 position:27% line:77% align:start
I found evidence of
a massive amount
of equipment

01:16:51.388 --> 01:16:53.290 position:27% line:83% align:start
being brought in
that was based off of

01:16:53.324 --> 01:16:55.859 position:27% line:83% align:start
the HC-25
brainwashing machine.

01:16:55.893 --> 01:16:58.728 position:30% line:77% align:start
But that's
pretty flimsy proof
to justify a raid.

01:16:58.761 --> 01:17:00.097 position:5% line:89% align:start
What about from the inside?

01:17:00.130 --> 01:17:03.933 position:21% line:83% align:start
I only found footage from
their manual labor wing.

01:17:03.967 --> 01:17:06.337 position:5% line:83% align:start
The defense barrier
protecting the education wing

01:17:06.370 --> 01:17:08.439 position:5% line:83% align:start
is a complex
virtual experience maze.

01:17:08.472 --> 01:17:10.474 position:5% line:83% align:start
I had no luck at all
sneaking in.

01:17:10.507 --> 01:17:14.077 position:21% line:89% align:start
Just looks like refugees.

01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:17.448 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then the children were being
held in the education wing,

01:17:17.481 --> 01:17:19.449 position:5% line:83% align:start
which means that
the abduction mechanism

01:17:19.483 --> 01:17:22.485 position:5% line:77% align:start
had to be built
into the place during
its planning stages.

01:17:22.518 --> 01:17:24.921 position:5% line:83% align:start
If it weren't,
I'd find it hard to believe

01:17:24.954 --> 01:17:26.422 position:5% line:83% align:start
that a rank
and file politician

01:17:26.456 --> 01:17:29.492 position:5% line:77% align:start
would have the balls
to propose such
an audacious policy.

01:17:29.525 --> 01:17:32.929 position:13% line:77% align:start
Then do you suspect that
when they laid the groundwork
for the project

01:17:32.962 --> 01:17:35.864 position:13% line:83% align:start
that the Puppeteer was also
among those involved?

01:17:37.766 --> 01:17:39.968 position:35% line:83% align:start
Ishikawa, use decoys
to make it look

01:17:40.002 --> 01:17:42.105 position:24% line:83% align:start
as if hackers are
trying to dive the place.

01:17:42.138 --> 01:17:43.406 position:44% line:89% align:start
I'm going in.

01:17:43.439 --> 01:17:44.440 position:41% line:89% align:start
Even if it fails,

01:17:44.474 --> 01:17:46.174 position:38% line:83% align:start
it'll give you guys
some cover.

01:17:46.209 --> 01:17:48.010 position:38% line:83% align:start
If you and Togusa
are still around,

01:17:48.043 --> 01:17:49.646 position:30% line:89% align:start
Section 9 can carry on.

01:17:49.679 --> 01:17:54.216 position:5% line:83% align:start
Batou, I don't want to hear
that kind of talk, all right?

01:17:55.851 --> 01:17:58.453 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, so you're the one
who's gonna retire this time?

01:17:58.487 --> 01:18:00.289 position:27% line:83% align:start
I appreciate
your consideration,

01:18:00.322 --> 01:18:03.025 position:27% line:77% align:start
but the only reason
I came here is to
ID the Puppeteer,

01:18:03.058 --> 01:18:04.426 position:35% line:89% align:start
nothing more.

01:18:04.459 --> 01:18:05.827 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's true you'll
always need someone

01:18:05.861 --> 01:18:07.596 position:27% line:83% align:start
who'll get their hands
dirty for you.

01:18:07.629 --> 01:18:11.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
And, besides, I don't have
anything to lose right now.

01:18:11.066 --> 01:18:15.003 position:5% line:83% align:start
Chief, no offense,
but I'm going there by myself.

01:18:15.037 --> 01:18:18.373 position:5% line:77% align:start
The Puppeteer is waiting
for an opportunity to
eliminate Munei,

01:18:18.407 --> 01:18:21.510 position:5% line:83% align:start
and I don't want to
miss this chance.

01:18:21.543 --> 01:18:25.012 position:7% line:83% align:start
But how do you plan to
find the Puppeteer, Major?

01:18:25.046 --> 01:18:29.283 position:7% line:77% align:start
We still don't have
the foggiest idea
who this character is.

01:18:29.317 --> 01:18:32.420 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna keep my ears open.

01:18:32.454 --> 01:18:35.557 position:16% line:89% align:start
My ghost will whisper.

01:18:45.132 --> 01:18:46.734 position:58% line:89% align:start
Whoa!

01:18:46.767 --> 01:18:49.804 position:33% line:83% align:start
Gosh, this is
kind of awkward, huh?

Left, left, right,

01:18:58.912 --> 01:19:00.348 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hi, everybody.

01:19:00.381 --> 01:19:03.049 position:33% line:83% align:start
It's been a long time,
hasn't it?

01:19:09.222 --> 01:19:12.125 position:21% line:89% align:start
All right, here we go.

[Major]
Let's do it.

01:19:30.543 --> 01:19:32.545 position:33% line:83% align:start
There's nothing like
the thrill you get

01:19:32.579 --> 01:19:35.482 position:33% line:77% align:start
from zipping along
in a physical body,
is there?

01:19:35.515 --> 01:19:38.884 position:5% line:83% align:start
Really? I wouldn't know.
I'm not used to my joints yet.

01:19:48.561 --> 01:19:51.964 position:5% line:83% align:start
Their response is strange
for a seemingly basic attack.

01:19:51.997 --> 01:19:54.333 position:5% line:83% align:start
Go to alert status
to be safe.

01:19:54.366 --> 01:19:55.934 position:69% line:89% align:start
Yes, sir.

01:20:00.305 --> 01:20:02.341 position:38% line:5% align:start
A fellow pro, huh?

01:20:02.374 --> 01:20:05.611 position:47% line:5% align:start
Uh-oh.

01:20:05.644 --> 01:20:09.281 position:19% line:83% align:start
I guess we have
each other's attention now.

01:20:17.088 --> 01:20:20.191 position:30% line:77% align:start
Hacking from
the public prosecutor's
office again, hmm?

01:20:20.224 --> 01:20:23.896 position:19% line:89% align:start
They're wasting their time.

01:20:32.970 --> 01:20:36.307 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm going to
inspect the facility.

01:20:43.614 --> 01:20:46.016 position:33% line:83% align:start
Pazu and Borma,
secure the evac route.

Roger.

Who are you?

01:21:22.786 --> 01:21:24.521 position:5% line:89% align:start
I could tell you.

01:21:24.554 --> 01:21:27.157 position:5% line:83% align:start
Of course, I'd have
to kill you, then.

[alarm blaring]

Here come
the security cyborgs!

01:21:51.982 --> 01:21:53.582 position:5% line:89% align:start
Major, you go on ahead.

01:22:05.628 --> 01:22:08.096 position:27% line:83% align:start
The one that got inside
is as good as dead.

01:22:08.129 --> 01:22:10.432 position:24% line:77% align:start
Go after the think tanks.
Got it.

That's what we want.

01:24:04.877 --> 01:24:07.680 position:5% line:89% align:start
No thermal signatures.

01:24:07.713 --> 01:24:10.116 position:5% line:89% align:start
Cloak of invisibility, hmm?

Your intel
is way out of date.

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:25.664 position:5% line:83% align:start
Type 3302 isn't called
a cloak of invisibility.

[Togusa]
Assemblyman Munei,

01:27:23.103 --> 01:27:24.905 position:30% line:83% align:start
we're Public Security
Section 9.

01:27:24.939 --> 01:27:28.374 position:30% line:77% align:start
We've already
seen for ourselves
what you're up to.

01:27:28.408 --> 01:27:30.343 position:30% line:83% align:start
Judging from
what we see here,

01:27:30.376 --> 01:27:34.281 position:21% line:77% align:start
a full scale compulsory
investigation would seem
unavoidable, wouldn't it?

01:27:36.250 --> 01:27:37.817 position:16% line:89% align:start
Really?

01:27:37.851 --> 01:27:39.552 position:5% line:83% align:start
Though it doesn't
show up on the books

01:27:39.586 --> 01:27:41.721 position:5% line:83% align:start
it's the government's
most vital agency.

01:27:41.754 --> 01:27:44.357 position:5% line:83% align:start
You self-righteous
Public Security piss ants

01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:45.692 position:5% line:89% align:start
have no business in here!

01:27:45.725 --> 01:27:47.327 position:19% line:83% align:start
Begging your pardon,
Assemblyman,

01:27:47.359 --> 01:27:50.630 position:10% line:83% align:start
but from what I observe here,
this exactly fits the criteria

01:27:50.663 --> 01:27:54.901 position:16% line:77% align:start
for the type of situation
in which our organization
needs to intervene.

01:27:54.934 --> 01:27:56.401 position:5% line:89% align:start
For a public servant,

01:27:56.435 --> 01:27:58.071 position:5% line:83% align:start
you don't seem to
have the vaguest clue

01:27:58.104 --> 01:28:01.040 position:5% line:77% align:start
as to the gravity
of the threat that
this country is facing.

01:28:01.074 --> 01:28:03.943 position:5% line:83% align:start
If nothing is done,
our country's prosperity

So to prevent that,
we're expending tax dollars

01:28:09.748 --> 01:28:11.984 position:5% line:83% align:start
on these children
who have no families,

01:28:12.017 --> 01:28:15.255 position:5% line:77% align:start
giving them educations

our future to them.

do you find wrong with that?

Those taxes
are from the money

01:28:20.225 --> 01:28:21.760 position:21% line:83% align:start
you've exploited
out of the elderly

If I could, I'd impose
a new tax on them

perhaps my motives

This country has
reached the point

01:32:18.224 --> 01:32:20.993 position:5% line:83% align:start
where someone has to
step in and take action.

01:32:21.026 --> 01:32:25.364 position:5% line:77% align:start
There's the problem
of 6 million plus
noble rot senior citizens

01:32:25.397 --> 01:32:27.899 position:5% line:83% align:start
increasing unemployment
and the proportionally

01:32:27.932 --> 01:32:29.801 position:5% line:89% align:start
decreasing worker population

01:32:29.834 --> 01:32:31.270 position:5% line:89% align:start
that continues unabated.

01:32:31.303 --> 01:32:34.173 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then there's the declining
birthrate, as well.

01:32:34.206 --> 01:32:37.276 position:5% line:89% align:start
So many problems to address.

01:32:37.309 --> 01:32:39.345 position:5% line:89% align:start
And here's a fact.

01:32:39.378 --> 01:32:41.880 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even though there's such
a furor over the birthrate,

01:32:41.913 --> 01:32:45.484 position:5% line:83% align:start
nearly 50,000 children in
this country under the age of 6

01:32:45.518 --> 01:32:47.752 position:5% line:83% align:start
needlessly lose
their lives every year.

01:32:47.785 --> 01:32:52.891 position:5% line:77% align:start
Approximately 30% of those
deaths can be attributed
to domestic abuse...

01:32:52.924 --> 01:32:54.826 position:35% line:77% align:start
Well, can you do it?
I'll try.

01:32:54.859 --> 01:32:58.729 position:5% line:77% align:start
Child guidance centers,
the police, and other
relevant authorities

01:32:58.762 --> 01:33:00.498 position:5% line:89% align:start
were aware of the situation,

01:33:00.532 --> 01:33:03.101 position:5% line:83% align:start
but they were unable
to prevent the deaths.

01:33:03.134 --> 01:33:06.271 position:5% line:83% align:start
This country's systems
have already collapsed,

01:33:06.304 --> 01:33:09.374 position:5% line:77% align:start
and the potential

is declining considerably.

01:33:09.407 --> 01:33:11.942 position:24% line:89% align:start
Major, now listen to me.

01:33:11.975 --> 01:33:13.178 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you stay in there
much longer,

01:33:13.211 --> 01:33:15.846 position:16% line:83% align:start
you're gonna whiteout along

01:33:15.879 --> 01:33:19.049 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's when I came upon
the idea of recycling ghosts

01:33:19.082 --> 01:33:21.351 position:5% line:83% align:start
that were being
damaged unnecessarily.

01:33:21.385 --> 01:33:24.922 position:5% line:83% align:start
I found at risk children through
the abuse surveillance net

01:33:24.955 --> 01:33:27.157 position:5% line:77% align:start
and then laundered
their family registers.

01:33:27.191 --> 01:33:30.794 position:5% line:83% align:start
I believed that it would
give them a new chance at life.

01:33:30.827 --> 01:33:34.565 position:21% line:83% align:start
So that's the core concept
of the Solid State System.

01:33:34.598 --> 01:33:36.633 position:5% line:89% align:start
Correct. But to make it work,

01:33:36.667 --> 01:33:38.268 position:5% line:83% align:start
it was essential
to have the assistance

01:33:38.302 --> 01:33:40.437 position:5% line:83% align:start
of the noble rot
senior citizens.

01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:43.006 position:5% line:83% align:start
they hunger for
a reason to exist.

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:45.775 position:5% line:83% align:start
Although they aren't able
to pass down their DNA,

01:33:45.808 --> 01:33:48.212 position:5% line:83% align:start
their posterity
would exist on paper.

01:33:48.245 --> 01:33:49.479 position:5% line:89% align:start
They would then have someone

01:33:49.513 --> 01:33:51.781 position:5% line:83% align:start
to whom they could
bequeath their belongings.

01:33:51.814 --> 01:33:53.950 position:5% line:83% align:start
That way, they could
continue to take part

01:33:53.983 --> 01:33:57.487 position:5% line:77% align:start
in this economic action
instead of forfeiting
their personal property

01:33:57.521 --> 01:33:59.556 position:5% line:83% align:start
to the state
upon their deaths.

01:33:59.590 --> 01:34:02.225 position:5% line:83% align:start
They happily gave my plan
their approval.

01:34:02.258 --> 01:34:05.528 position:30% line:77% align:start
You realize that
what you're doing
is a crime, don't you?

01:34:05.561 --> 01:34:08.464 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes, but if those ends
had absolute priority,

01:34:08.497 --> 01:34:10.900 position:5% line:83% align:start
they would be
the only possible means.

01:34:10.933 --> 01:34:13.603 position:5% line:83% align:start
My primary task was to
save these children

01:34:13.636 --> 01:34:15.538 position:5% line:83% align:start
who were in danger
as soon as I could.

01:34:15.571 --> 01:34:18.641 position:5% line:77% align:start
For that reason alone,
I have no regrets
about what I've done,

01:34:18.674 --> 01:34:20.610 position:5% line:83% align:start
even though
it's cost me my life.

01:34:20.643 --> 01:34:24.513 position:5% line:77% align:start
On the contrary,
it means that my life as
a bureaucrat had meaning.

01:34:24.547 --> 01:34:28.049 position:5% line:77% align:start
All that remained
was to reinforce
the Solid State System

01:34:28.083 --> 01:34:31.520 position:5% line:83% align:start
and make it into
a self-perpetuating mechanism.

01:34:34.256 --> 01:34:37.826 position:30% line:77% align:start
Maybe, but the purging
one by one of those
who had meddled

01:34:37.859 --> 01:34:39.961 position:27% line:83% align:start
with your system drew
attention to your plan,

01:34:39.995 --> 01:34:42.330 position:13% line:89% align:start
and the scheme was uncovered.

01:34:42.364 --> 01:34:45.300 position:5% line:77% align:start
Considering how they
must've felt when they knew
that the end was near,

01:34:45.333 --> 01:34:47.369 position:5% line:83% align:start
their reactions
are understandable.

01:34:47.402 --> 01:34:50.038 position:24% line:89% align:start
Now, Karam, I can see.

01:34:50.071 --> 01:34:52.340 position:24% line:89% align:start
But Munei, why him?

01:34:52.374 --> 01:34:54.709 position:5% line:83% align:start
Because Munei held
the children prisoner here.

01:34:54.743 --> 01:34:58.812 position:5% line:77% align:start
If those young ones
end up becoming
brainwashed elite for him,

01:34:58.846 --> 01:35:01.750 position:5% line:83% align:start
giving them new leases
on life was for nothing.

01:35:01.782 --> 01:35:03.851 position:5% line:89% align:start
Children need an education,

01:35:03.884 --> 01:35:06.053 position:5% line:83% align:start
but if they aren't
released out into the world,

01:35:06.086 --> 01:35:08.323 position:5% line:83% align:start
they won't develop
a strong will of their own.

01:35:08.356 --> 01:35:11.526 position:5% line:83% align:start
That was the point of contention
between Munei and I,

01:35:11.559 --> 01:35:14.795 position:5% line:83% align:start
and it was the main reason
why I had to eliminate him.

01:35:14.828 --> 01:35:18.065 position:5% line:83% align:start
But this time, you people
had to go and show up.

01:35:18.098 --> 01:35:21.969 position:5% line:77% align:start
Nevertheless, my plan
has progressed smoothly
to its next phase.

01:35:22.002 --> 01:35:23.504 position:52% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:35:23.537 --> 01:35:26.607 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've never been able
to hack your cyber brain,

01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:29.910 position:5% line:77% align:start
but now I've succeeded
in getting you to link me
directly into it.

01:35:29.943 --> 01:35:31.478 position:30% line:89% align:start
Major!

01:35:31.512 --> 01:35:33.580 position:5% line:89% align:start
[electronic interference]

01:35:36.983 --> 01:35:40.920 position:5% line:83% align:start
You killed yourself just to
lure me into linking with you?

01:35:40.953 --> 01:35:42.822 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're a formidable opponent,

01:35:42.855 --> 01:35:45.292 position:19% line:83% align:start
but if I can momentarily
trap you in a thought maze,

01:35:45.326 --> 01:35:48.629 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll be able to eliminate
Section 9 all at once.

01:35:52.332 --> 01:35:53.701 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm surprised.

01:35:53.734 --> 01:35:55.968 position:5% line:83% align:start
Your thinking is so
arrogant and self-righteous,

01:35:56.002 --> 01:35:58.037 position:5% line:89% align:start
yet you have so much drive.

01:35:58.071 --> 01:36:01.107 position:5% line:83% align:start
Being a bureaucrat
is a waste of your talent.

01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:03.609 position:5% line:89% align:start
Plus, you know all about me.

01:36:03.643 --> 01:36:06.546 position:5% line:89% align:start
Who the hell are you?

01:36:06.579 --> 01:36:09.881 position:35% line:83% align:start
You still haven't
pieced it together?

01:36:09.915 --> 01:36:12.884 position:21% line:89% align:start
Come now, Motoko Kusanagi,

01:36:12.918 --> 01:36:15.854 position:21% line:83% align:start
Surely there can't be
an overabundance of people

01:36:15.887 --> 01:36:17.423 position:16% line:89% align:start
dwelling within your memory,

01:36:17.457 --> 01:36:20.926 position:21% line:77% align:start
burning with
this overwhelming,
egotistical, rightfulness.

01:36:39.978 --> 01:36:43.982 position:5% line:77% align:start
We've synchronized
with countless consciousnesses
over the years,

01:36:44.015 --> 01:36:46.184 position:5% line:83% align:start
so it shouldn't come
as a big surprise

01:36:46.218 --> 01:36:50.489 position:5% line:77% align:start
that your deep,
collective subconscious
came to life.

01:36:50.522 --> 01:36:53.792 position:5% line:83% align:start
And with it,
the Solid State is complete.

01:36:53.825 --> 01:36:55.727 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's time for us to go forth.

01:36:55.761 --> 01:36:58.430 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's become
a vanishing mediator

01:36:58.463 --> 01:37:02.166 position:5% line:83% align:start
and go take an active hand
in the next society.

01:37:23.654 --> 01:37:24.622 position:5% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

01:37:24.655 --> 01:37:26.857 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can't see anything.

01:37:26.891 --> 01:37:28.526 position:5% line:83% align:start
Somebody give me
a status report.

01:37:38.636 --> 01:37:40.438 position:5% line:89% align:start
Finally awake?

01:37:40.471 --> 01:37:43.339 position:35% line:89% align:start
Batou, are you there?

01:37:43.373 --> 01:37:47.812 position:35% line:83% align:start
What's happening?
Where am I?

01:37:54.384 --> 01:37:56.653 position:16% line:89% align:start
So, did they make a decision

01:37:56.686 --> 01:37:58.188 position:24% line:83% align:start
about what to do
with the children?

01:37:58.221 --> 01:38:00.925 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hmm. It appears
that they're going to be

01:38:00.957 --> 01:38:03.726 position:5% line:77% align:start
returned to
their real parents
for the time being.

01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:06.396 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even though their memories
were overwritten

01:38:06.429 --> 01:38:08.898 position:19% line:83% align:start
and they have
no knowledge of any abuse.

01:38:08.932 --> 01:38:12.535 position:19% line:83% align:start
I wonder if that's really
what's best for the kids.

01:38:12.569 --> 01:38:15.037 position:5% line:83% align:start
Perhaps the fact that
no one can answer

01:38:15.070 --> 01:38:16.873 position:5% line:83% align:start
such a critical question
after all this

01:38:16.906 --> 01:38:19.876 position:5% line:83% align:start
underscores the limitations
of our system.

01:38:19.909 --> 01:38:23.245 position:16% line:83% align:start
What'll happen to those kids
who found foster parents

01:38:23.278 --> 01:38:26.716 position:24% line:77% align:start
and managed to get out
before their brainwashing
education began?

01:38:28.885 --> 01:38:31.987 position:5% line:83% align:start
For me, I'd say we'll have to
wait a while for the verdicts.

01:38:32.020 --> 01:38:35.257 position:5% line:83% align:start
I expect there to be some
rather complicated trials

01:38:35.290 --> 01:38:38.660 position:5% line:83% align:start
as they go through them
on a case by case basis.

01:38:40.128 --> 01:38:42.865 position:44% line:77% align:start
Then, Chief,
when a situation
like this arises,

01:38:42.898 --> 01:38:45.099 position:35% line:89% align:start
what can we hope for?

01:38:45.133 --> 01:38:47.536 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can only
tell you one thing.

01:38:47.569 --> 01:38:49.972 position:5% line:83% align:start
We need to persevere
and work within the rules

01:38:50.004 --> 01:38:51.239 position:5% line:89% align:start
by which we're governed.

01:38:51.272 --> 01:38:53.107 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's the best
we can do to make a stand

01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:54.576 position:5% line:89% align:start
against the unjust for now.

01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:02.851 position:33% line:83% align:start
I only wish that when
those kids are grown,

01:39:02.885 --> 01:39:05.687 position:10% line:83% align:start
when they've matured and
reached their full potentials,

01:39:05.721 --> 01:39:08.757 position:13% line:83% align:start
they'll be able to find
the answers that we couldn't.

01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:11.492 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's my hope.

01:39:13.896 --> 01:39:16.531 position:16% line:83% align:start
You know, if you just
sit down and think about it,

01:39:16.564 --> 01:39:20.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
the name Solid State System
is actually quite ironic.

01:39:20.368 --> 01:39:24.705 position:5% line:77% align:start
The guy's metaphor
for cyber brains of
old people as transistors.

01:39:24.739 --> 01:39:27.073 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh. Sure sounds like something

01:39:27.107 --> 01:39:30.478 position:5% line:83% align:start
a stuffed shirt bureaucrat
would come up with, doesn't it?

01:39:30.511 --> 01:39:33.581 position:5% line:83% align:start
I gotta admit,
I was a little freaked out

01:39:33.614 --> 01:39:36.584 position:5% line:83% align:start
to learn who
the Puppeteer really was.

01:39:41.121 --> 01:39:43.223 position:19% line:89% align:start
What are you talking about?

01:39:43.256 --> 01:39:46.092 position:5% line:83% align:start
We discovered a few
interesting bits of information

01:39:46.126 --> 01:39:49.229 position:5% line:83% align:start
after you lost consciousness
when he died.

01:39:49.262 --> 01:39:53.300 position:5% line:77% align:start
That pencil pusher,
he actually croaked
two years ago.

01:39:53.333 --> 01:39:57.771 position:5% line:89% align:start
Name: Tataaki Koshiki. Age 33.

01:39:57.804 --> 01:40:01.474 position:5% line:83% align:start
Born into a respectable family
of civil servants.

01:40:01.508 --> 01:40:03.843 position:5% line:83% align:start
Fast track to elite status
since childhood.

01:40:03.877 --> 01:40:07.347 position:5% line:83% align:start
College, then the Ministry
of Management and Coordination.

01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:11.051 position:5% line:83% align:start
But he quickly grew frustrated
and stopped going to work

01:40:11.083 --> 01:40:14.153 position:5% line:77% align:start
possibly because he had
no sense of purpose
as a civil servant.

01:40:14.186 --> 01:40:15.589 position:5% line:89% align:start
Due to his cyber brain skills,

01:40:15.622 --> 01:40:17.456 position:5% line:83% align:start
he was allowed
to work from home

01:40:17.489 --> 01:40:19.525 position:5% line:83% align:start
through a remote
prosthetic body.

01:40:19.558 --> 01:40:23.295 position:5% line:77% align:start
But he was
apparently indifferent
to performing his duties.

01:40:23.329 --> 01:40:26.532 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then, two years ago,
Munei noticed the guy's talents.

01:40:26.565 --> 01:40:28.935 position:5% line:83% align:start
Those abilities were skills
he needed on his project

01:40:28.969 --> 01:40:32.204 position:5% line:83% align:start
to manipulate both the welfare
and management ministries.

01:40:32.237 --> 01:40:33.405 position:5% line:89% align:start
Munei brought him on board,

01:40:33.439 --> 01:40:35.341 position:5% line:83% align:start
and Koshiki
independently designed

01:40:35.374 --> 01:40:37.576 position:5% line:83% align:start
and implemented
his abduction system.

01:40:37.610 --> 01:40:40.144 position:5% line:83% align:start
But the trouble was Koshiki
wasn't the type who stood out.

01:40:40.178 --> 01:40:42.246 position:5% line:89% align:start
He wasn't noticeable.

01:40:42.281 --> 01:40:44.683 position:5% line:83% align:start
In spite of the huge job
he was working on,

01:40:44.717 --> 01:40:47.318 position:5% line:83% align:start
not one damn person
happened to realize

01:40:47.352 --> 01:40:50.089 position:5% line:83% align:start
that the poor slob had
gotten sick and died at home.

01:40:52.992 --> 01:40:56.194 position:5% line:77% align:start
Thanks to that,
the true identity
of the Puppeteer

01:40:56.227 --> 01:40:59.130 position:5% line:83% align:start
is gonna remain
a mystery forever.

01:41:02.166 --> 01:41:05.370 position:24% line:83% align:start
So now we know the truth
about Koshiki's death.

01:41:05.403 --> 01:41:06.972 position:27% line:83% align:start
Does it then mean
that someone else

01:41:07.006 --> 01:41:10.109 position:13% line:83% align:start
was operating his remote body
to cause all of this?

01:41:10.141 --> 01:41:12.443 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's possible.

01:41:12.477 --> 01:41:14.379 position:33% line:83% align:start
As a matter of fact,
of any theory,

01:41:14.412 --> 01:41:16.547 position:33% line:83% align:start
that's probably
the most likely.

01:41:16.581 --> 01:41:19.517 position:24% line:77% align:start
Even with those old folks
that formed a gestalt
with the guy.

01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:21.218 position:35% line:83% align:start
Their collective
unconsciousness

01:41:21.251 --> 01:41:22.587 position:33% line:83% align:start
was the force
behind their actions,

01:41:22.620 --> 01:41:24.287 position:35% line:83% align:start
and caused them
to do what they did.

01:41:24.321 --> 01:41:27.659 position:24% line:77% align:start
I hate to say it,
but there's no way
to find out for sure now.

01:41:27.692 --> 01:41:30.695 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh.

01:41:30.728 --> 01:41:33.064 position:41% line:89% align:start
With one exception.

01:41:33.097 --> 01:41:35.967 position:27% line:83% align:start
The conversation
between you and Koshiki

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.769 position:27% line:83% align:start
that's recorded in
the Tachikoma's memory.

01:41:41.271 --> 01:41:43.707 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is it still stored in there?

01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:46.710 position:30% line:83% align:start
It should be,
but when Koshiki died,

01:41:46.743 --> 01:41:49.413 position:30% line:77% align:start
they claimed that
all his memories
underwent a whiteout

01:41:49.446 --> 01:41:52.816 position:30% line:83% align:start
and were supposedly
lost along with him.

01:41:52.849 --> 01:41:56.987 position:5% line:83% align:start
Batou, did you listen in
on that conversation?

01:41:58.055 --> 01:42:00.524 position:35% line:89% align:start
Well, sort of.

01:42:00.557 --> 01:42:04.061 position:27% line:77% align:start
At this point, though,
it doesn't really
matter now, does it?

01:42:04.094 --> 01:42:07.831 position:21% line:77% align:start
They neglected old timers,
those kids who were
being abused,

01:42:07.864 --> 01:42:11.802 position:30% line:77% align:start
all that stuff
is on its way toward
being resolved at last.

01:42:11.835 --> 01:42:15.005 position:33% line:77% align:start
Even if we didn't
find the true identity
of the Puppeteer,

01:42:15.038 --> 01:42:18.207 position:35% line:83% align:start
this case is still
more or less closed.

01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:20.077 position:5% line:89% align:start
Written off as a scandal

01:42:20.110 --> 01:42:22.045 position:5% line:83% align:start
involving a few
bad apple politicians?

01:42:24.947 --> 01:42:27.683 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's the strangest thing, Batou.

01:42:27.717 --> 01:42:29.251 position:66% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

01:42:29.285 --> 01:42:34.056 position:33% line:77% align:start
What have I been
feeling so jaded and
disillusioned about?

01:42:34.090 --> 01:42:36.224 position:33% line:83% align:start
What do you think
I was searching for

01:42:36.257 --> 01:42:38.594 position:33% line:83% align:start
as I was wandering
around the net?

01:42:38.627 --> 01:42:41.864 position:33% line:89% align:start
A friend? Truth?

01:42:41.897 --> 01:42:45.101 position:33% line:83% align:start
Or a certain special
someone, maybe?

01:42:45.134 --> 01:42:48.704 position:19% line:83% align:start
Perhaps I just wanted
to blame this organization

01:42:48.738 --> 01:42:52.340 position:19% line:83% align:start
or even the system for my
own sense of helplessness.

01:42:52.373 --> 01:42:54.275 position:5% line:89% align:start
Heh. What's gotten into you?

01:42:54.309 --> 01:42:56.745 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're turning all
meek and modest on me?

01:42:56.778 --> 01:42:59.014 position:5% line:83% align:start
Did you get whatever it was
out of your system?

01:43:01.249 --> 01:43:04.319 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okay, so what are
you gonna do now?

01:43:04.352 --> 01:43:08.256 position:5% line:77% align:start
Plan on keeping up
that picking the
investigations you conduct

01:43:08.289 --> 01:43:12.127 position:5% line:83% align:start
based on your gut feelings
about 'em routine of yours?

01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:14.261 position:35% line:83% align:start
Maybe I'm finished
with that, too.

01:43:14.294 --> 01:43:17.165 position:30% line:83% align:start
When I'm operating
under restrictions,

01:43:17.198 --> 01:43:19.567 position:30% line:83% align:start
I definitely feel
constrained by them,

01:43:19.601 --> 01:43:21.069 position:13% line:89% align:start
but without those restraints,

01:43:21.102 --> 01:43:23.938 position:27% line:77% align:start
it doesn't seem
like my actions are
accomplishing anything.

01:43:23.972 --> 01:43:26.540 position:27% line:83% align:start
I guess I'm right back
to where I started from.

01:43:26.573 --> 01:43:28.642 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's that supposed to mean?

01:43:28.675 --> 01:43:32.279 position:5% line:83% align:start
Is that your way of saying
your coming back to Section 9?

01:43:32.312 --> 01:43:33.680 position:41% line:89% align:start
What about Togusa?

01:43:33.714 --> 01:43:36.217 position:33% line:83% align:start
Would I get in the way
of his development?

01:43:36.251 --> 01:43:37.851 position:5% line:83% align:start
If that prevents him
from growing,

01:43:37.885 --> 01:43:41.522 position:5% line:83% align:start
then he wasn't going to
go any further anyway.

01:43:41.555 --> 01:43:44.958 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't sweat it
if I were you.

01:43:44.992 --> 01:43:47.127 position:16% line:89% align:start
Perhaps you're right.

01:43:51.765 --> 01:43:56.503 position:13% line:83% align:start
Batou, the net truly is
vast and infinite.

01:43:58.272 --> 01:44:00.040 position:19% line:89% align:start
Who knows?

01:44:00.073 --> 01:44:02.810 position:13% line:83% align:start
Maybe a new society
we've never even dreamed of

01:44:02.843 --> 01:44:06.312 position:13% line:89% align:start
is already being born.
