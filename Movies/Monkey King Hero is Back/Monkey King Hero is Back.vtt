00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:26.586
According
to legend, long ago

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:30.799
there was a Monkey
King named, Sun Wukong.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.842
Although he had great powers,

00:01:32.884 --> 00:01:34.844
he was also a
great troublemaker.

00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.431
And when he broke the
law of the heavens,

00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:41.685
the Jade Emperor
would have no more.

00:01:41.726 --> 00:01:44.396
- Insolent monkey, you
have broken my laws

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:45.855
and shall taste my wrath.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.654
- Tastes pretty sweet to me.

00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:00.286
- What're you waiting for?

00:02:00.328 --> 00:02:02.831
Capture him.

00:02:18.847 --> 00:02:20.598
- I'm going to make
you dream of this.

00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:29.315
Too slow.

00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:30.900
- Use the magical lute.

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:08.855
- Huh?

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:10.523
Release the arrows.

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:17.781
The bigger they
are, the harder they fall.

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.367
I'm no ordinary monkey.

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:22.660
And that's Great Sage to you.

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:27.457
The Monkey King
defeated the heavenly army.

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:31.544
And wanted to become a god,
known as the Great Sage.

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:34.589
But Buddha did not like his
defiance against the heavens

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:36.925
and denied him entry.

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:39.552
Ever since that fateful day

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:41.429
Sun Wukong has been imprisoned

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:44.391
under the Mountain
of Five Elements.

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:50.021
He has been there for 500 years.

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:55.485
That's right, the great
sage will keep you safe.

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:57.696
There, there, you can have it.

00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:01.991
And one day, he may return.

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:08.790
Here, let me.

00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:27.976
He's fine.

00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:29.602
- It was just a little scare.

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:34.024
Everyone, the
trolls are coming.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.985
- Go back down the mountain.

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:38.546
- Huh?

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:43.760
What is that?

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:47.972
Oh.

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:52.560
It's a baby.

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:53.853
Come her child.

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:12.914
Thank you for this blessing.

00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:48.176
Sun Wukong,

00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:50.970
the Monkey King fights
the four heavenly kings.

00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:52.972
Oh we'll pay for this, monkey.

00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:57.143
Sun Wukong
can never die.

00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:59.813
Do not, you're
ruining the show.

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:03.775
Fa Ming

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:04.818
where are you?

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:07.946
Get back.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.669
Here I come Sun Wukong.

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:35.849
Away you.

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:40.103
Huh?

00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:41.855
Sifu?

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:42.856
- Liuer?

00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:43.982
What are you up to now?

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:45.150
- Begging

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.151
for alms.

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:49.070
Huh?

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:52.866
Thank you for this blessing.

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:59.122
- Liuer, I hope you grow
up to be a good monk.

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:00.290
Okay?

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:01.791
Then you won't have
to be like the rest

00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:04.169
of the people in this world.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.879
- I have a question.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.088
As monks we spend our days

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.007
trying to find out way
to fill our bellies.

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:12.093
How is that different from
everyone else in this world?

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:13.219
- Of course it's different.

00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:15.096
Begging for alms is
only the beginning

00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:17.140
of becoming a great monk.

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:21.061
- Reciting sutra, meditation
and practicing zen.

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:23.021
- Reciting sutra, meditation
and practicing zen.

00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:24.230
Do not ask for much now,

00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:27.776
you will find peace
in your heart.

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:30.945
Take a look at me,
am I not doing well?

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:36.159
- But the mountain
trolls keep attacking.

00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:38.078
Reciting sutras won't
scare them away.

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:40.038
- So what would you
do instead child?

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.247
- I would

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:44.042
learn Kung fu and
beat the trolls.

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:44.417
Like this?

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:46.211
Ow.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.047
- Jiang Liuer,

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:52.342
to save the world you
don't have to be a warrior.

00:09:52.384 --> 00:09:56.304
By meditation, reciting
sutra and begging for alms,

00:09:56.346 --> 00:10:01.226
we monks are saving the world
with each little good deed.

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:04.187
And don't forget how the
slow turtle won the race.

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:06.106
Everything is illusion.

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:09.067
Life is illusion
of your desires.

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:10.276
Don't be quick to fight,

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:11.861
instead you must.

00:10:11.903 --> 00:10:13.196
- Recite my sutra
like a good monk.

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:14.114
- Wrong answer.

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:15.031
Not proper.

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:18.118
Another try.

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:20.203
- Yes, Sifu.

00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:23.248
Ah but some day
he will be great monk.

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:48.314
- Mountain trolls are
coming, mountain trolls.

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:49.357
- Alright charge.

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:50.859
Release.

00:10:58.408 --> 00:10:59.367
- Attack.

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:20.263
- Liuer?

00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:22.015
Liuer?

00:11:22.057 --> 00:11:23.016
Liuer?

00:11:23.058 --> 00:11:24.392
Where are you son?

00:11:25.268 --> 00:11:27.228
- One, two, four.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.397
How many is that?

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.025
- This one's too old.

00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:33.276
Throw it out.

00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:35.403
- But then we lose
one more girl baby

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:38.073
- One girl baby coming up.

00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:44.037
Guys, I got.

00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:47.999
Run for your lives.

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:57.300
- Liuer what are
you doing up there?

00:11:58.927 --> 00:11:59.552
Try to stay out of trouble.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:07.394
- Come on Sifu run.

00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:09.104
- Where am I?

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:12.899
- Hurry Sifu.

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:16.194
- Liuer, Liuer.

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:16.945
- Sifu.

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:18.363
Follow me.

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:43.388
Sifu.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.472
Hurry, run.

00:14:22.404 --> 00:14:24.030
- Did you get the girl?

00:14:29.077 --> 00:14:30.120
That's not.

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:31.413
You fool.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.567
- Liuer?

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:03.236
Can you hear me?

00:15:03.278 --> 00:15:04.612
Where are you?

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:10.679
Run.

00:17:03.648 --> 00:17:05.400
Wow.

00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:22.579
Well
don't just stand there.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:23.872
Get him.

00:20:17.842 --> 00:20:18.551
Thanks kids.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:21.763
I've got it from here.

00:21:07.058 --> 00:21:08.977
I'm free.

00:21:53.063 --> 00:21:55.648
You locked me up
for 500 long years,

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.567
that's not enough for you?

00:21:57.609 --> 00:21:58.651
But don't you forget,

00:21:58.693 --> 00:22:00.570
I'm the Great Sage.

00:22:00.612 --> 00:22:01.738
- Huh?

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.656
The Great Sage?

00:22:03.698 --> 00:22:04.908
- Who's that?

00:22:07.702 --> 00:22:08.703
Come out.

00:22:08.745 --> 00:22:10.705
You lookin' for a fight?

00:22:10.747 --> 00:22:13.667
Maybe a babysitter?

00:22:13.708 --> 00:22:16.503
- Are you really Sun Wukong?

00:22:16.544 --> 00:22:17.754
The Great Sage?

00:22:17.796 --> 00:22:18.880
- I don't know am I?

00:22:18.922 --> 00:22:19.673
Really?

00:22:20.173 --> 00:22:21.675
- What?

00:22:21.716 --> 00:22:22.676
He really is the
great Monkey King.

00:22:22.717 --> 00:22:23.802
No greatness here.

00:22:23.843 --> 00:22:26.596
Just a monkey enjoying bananas.

00:22:27.722 --> 00:22:29.891
- Wait, Great Sage?

00:22:35.563 --> 00:22:37.857
Oh, so you mean
he went that way?

00:22:39.109 --> 00:22:40.860
Thank you Mister Groundhog.

00:22:52.038 --> 00:22:53.039
Great Sage,

00:22:53.081 --> 00:22:55.166
I need your help getting home.

00:23:02.882 --> 00:23:04.884
So will you help me
find my way home?

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.560
- I'm not too good at
hide and seek I guess.

00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:14.894
- Wait.

00:23:19.607 --> 00:23:21.026
That's okay.

00:23:21.067 --> 00:23:23.862
I can just hang out with you
until I find my way back.

00:23:23.903 --> 00:23:24.904
This is gonna be great.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.156
Huh?

00:23:29.784 --> 00:23:30.869
- If we're gonna
travel together,

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:32.912
you better keep up.

00:23:36.875 --> 00:23:38.043
- Great Sage?

00:23:40.628 --> 00:23:41.129
Did you use your
powers to do that?

00:23:41.171 --> 00:23:41.880
- What?

00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:42.756
How'd you?

00:23:42.797 --> 00:23:43.882
What?

00:23:43.923 --> 00:23:45.342
- 'Cause you know,

00:23:45.383 --> 00:23:48.636
I thought maybe you could
teach me some magic skills.

00:23:49.387 --> 00:23:50.764
- Listen short stuff,

00:23:50.805 --> 00:23:51.931
those things aren't
that easy to teach.

00:23:54.684 --> 00:23:55.977
- Okay then,

00:23:56.019 --> 00:23:57.062
what about an easy trick?

00:23:57.103 --> 00:23:58.104
This'll be great.

00:24:00.273 --> 00:24:01.608
My new teacher,

00:24:01.649 --> 00:24:03.193
Sun Wukong.

00:24:03.234 --> 00:24:06.029
The king of the monkeys
who can't be beat.

00:24:06.071 --> 00:24:08.948
You're also immortal
so you can protest us.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:10.784
But the coolest
thing you can do,

00:24:10.825 --> 00:24:13.036
is leap over clouds.

00:24:13.078 --> 00:24:14.829
Huh?

00:24:17.832 --> 00:24:18.792
You can make clone
from your hair.

00:24:18.833 --> 00:24:19.334
- Hey, ouch.

00:24:19.376 --> 00:24:20.627
- By blowing.

00:24:20.669 --> 00:24:20.960
- Watch it.

00:24:21.002 --> 00:24:22.045
- Hmm?

00:24:22.087 --> 00:24:23.254
How come nothing happened?

00:24:24.255 --> 00:24:25.173
I almost forgot,

00:24:25.215 --> 00:24:26.174
there's one more thing.

00:24:26.216 --> 00:24:27.217
Do you have your power pole?

00:24:28.802 --> 00:24:30.887
And is it true you
can shrink it so small

00:24:30.929 --> 00:24:33.139
to the size of a toothpick?

00:24:33.181 --> 00:24:34.849
Well, is it true Great Sage?

00:24:34.891 --> 00:24:36.059
Oh, I remember,

00:24:36.101 --> 00:24:37.977
you hide it your ear.

00:24:38.019 --> 00:24:39.813
Let me see it, is it in there?

00:24:39.854 --> 00:24:41.981
Oh, oh I'd love to hold it it.

00:24:42.023 --> 00:24:43.191
- You need to zip it.

00:24:43.233 --> 00:24:44.943
You won't stop talking will you?

00:24:44.984 --> 00:24:47.070
I can't think 'cause my
head's about to explode.

00:24:47.112 --> 00:24:49.197
Please be quiet, okay?

00:24:49.239 --> 00:24:50.657
- Okay.

00:24:50.699 --> 00:24:51.491
But it is.

00:24:51.533 --> 00:24:53.034
- Not one more question, okay?

00:24:53.076 --> 00:24:53.952
Not a single one.

00:24:53.993 --> 00:24:55.203
- Okay.

00:24:55.245 --> 00:24:56.913
So when can I start
asking questions again?

00:25:01.835 --> 00:25:02.752
Whoa.

00:25:02.794 --> 00:25:04.212
So cool.

00:25:04.254 --> 00:25:05.964
Hey, how'd you do that?

00:25:06.006 --> 00:25:07.173
Does your hand hurt?

00:25:07.215 --> 00:25:08.967
Could you teach
me how to do that?

00:25:10.802 --> 00:25:12.220
Tell me about your
greatest battle.

00:25:12.262 --> 00:25:14.097
- Well, there was this one
kid who never left me alone.

00:25:14.139 --> 00:25:16.057
- He sounds terrible.

00:25:16.099 --> 00:25:17.183
- Oh he was.

00:25:17.225 --> 00:25:18.184
He never stopped talking.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:20.854
- How'd you get all your powers?

00:25:20.895 --> 00:25:22.272
- I ate a bunch
of magic bananas.

00:25:26.109 --> 00:25:27.068
Huh?

00:25:49.174 --> 00:25:51.051
- The ruthless Sun Wukong.

00:25:51.092 --> 00:25:54.888
I, the Mountain Lord
was created to ensure

00:25:54.929 --> 00:25:56.264
you would not escape.

00:25:56.306 --> 00:25:57.182
- You?

00:25:57.223 --> 00:25:58.266
You're literally

00:25:58.308 --> 00:26:00.852
as dumb as a box of rocks.

00:26:00.894 --> 00:26:02.020
Come on, this doesn't
have to get ugly.

00:26:02.062 --> 00:26:03.938
You're doing that all yourself.

00:26:07.192 --> 00:26:09.027
- There'll be no chains

00:26:09.069 --> 00:26:12.322
but that doesn't mean
he wants to abound,

00:26:12.364 --> 00:26:16.910
now, you're just an
ordinary, stinkin' monkey.

00:26:16.951 --> 00:26:19.204
I can't wait to crush you.

00:26:23.958 --> 00:26:25.168
How dare you your come.

00:26:42.143 --> 00:26:43.144
- Hey pebbles,

00:26:43.186 --> 00:26:44.020
this'll hurt.

00:27:11.297 --> 00:27:12.298
Oh.

00:27:17.345 --> 00:27:18.972
The spell that
brought him to life.

00:27:27.981 --> 00:27:30.817
This day is not getting better.

00:28:22.911 --> 00:28:24.287
- Stay right here.

00:28:47.268 --> 00:28:48.978
- Whoa too hard,
what's the big idea?

00:28:58.446 --> 00:28:59.447
- The spell.

00:28:59.489 --> 00:29:01.199
Look.

00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:35.358
I
suppose you could say

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:38.987
that the Mountain Lord
has hit rock bottom.

00:29:41.072 --> 00:29:43.241
Luckily for you, I
still haven't unleashed

00:29:43.283 --> 00:29:44.492
the Dragon Guardian.

00:29:46.161 --> 00:29:47.370
- Your highness,

00:29:47.412 --> 00:29:49.456
it's not our fault,
he's no ordinary monkey,

00:29:49.497 --> 00:29:51.041
he's Sun Wukong.

00:29:51.082 --> 00:29:52.459
- Since I'm so generous,

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.961
I'll give you one last chance.

00:29:55.003 --> 00:29:55.962
But this time,

00:29:56.004 --> 00:29:57.464
no monkeying around.

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:19.110
- Ah, Great Sage?

00:30:20.612 --> 00:30:22.322
You're here too.

00:30:22.364 --> 00:30:24.240
I thought I lost you.

00:30:24.282 --> 00:30:25.283
Ah.

00:30:26.242 --> 00:30:27.577
Wait, how did you get here?

00:30:27.619 --> 00:30:30.163
the last thing I remember
was the Mountain Lord.

00:30:30.205 --> 00:30:32.165
I just fell out of the blue.

00:30:32.207 --> 00:30:34.292
I think I landed in the water.

00:30:34.334 --> 00:30:35.335
- Okay.

00:30:35.377 --> 00:30:36.336
I know.

00:30:38.338 --> 00:30:39.339
Isn't that great?

00:30:39.381 --> 00:30:41.257
He really does have powers.

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:43.593
Great Sage?

00:30:47.055 --> 00:30:48.223
I wanted to say,

00:30:48.264 --> 00:30:50.016
thank you for saving us.

00:31:00.235 --> 00:31:01.403
- Here.

00:31:01.444 --> 00:31:02.570
- No, no, no I can't eat that.

00:31:02.612 --> 00:31:05.198
I'm a vegetarian.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.408
- You are?

00:31:06.449 --> 00:31:08.076
- Yeah, you see,
granddad's a monk

00:31:08.118 --> 00:31:09.369
so we don't eat meat.

00:31:09.411 --> 00:31:11.329
His name is Fa Ming and
my name is Jiang Liuer.

00:31:11.371 --> 00:31:12.038
- Just eat it.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.331
- Yuck.

00:31:13.373 --> 00:31:15.500
- If you're a monk then
how'd you end up here?

00:31:17.711 --> 00:31:20.213
- It's 'cause of
those horrible trolls.

00:31:20.255 --> 00:31:22.465
They kidnapped children,
so we ran away from them.

00:31:23.633 --> 00:31:24.884
But they kept chasing us,

00:31:24.926 --> 00:31:27.095
we kept running and
somehow we ended up here.

00:31:29.723 --> 00:31:31.349
And now we're lost.

00:31:41.443 --> 00:31:42.235
Wait.

00:31:42.277 --> 00:31:43.445
What's the big deal?

00:31:43.486 --> 00:31:45.071
We don't need to
be afraid anymore

00:31:45.113 --> 00:31:46.573
'cause you're here
to protect us.

00:31:55.457 --> 00:31:58.626
- And, who's gonna
protect me from you kid?

00:32:00.295 --> 00:32:01.671
Once we got off this mountain,

00:32:01.713 --> 00:32:04.591
we'll go our
separate ways, okay?

00:32:04.632 --> 00:32:05.633
- Well then how
will you teach me?

00:32:09.137 --> 00:32:10.305
Careful, you'll slip and fall.

00:32:17.479 --> 00:32:18.271
Great Sage?

00:32:18.313 --> 00:32:20.607
- No, I'm safer up here.

00:32:24.652 --> 00:32:26.154
- So you like sushi, eh?

00:32:38.333 --> 00:32:39.417
Great Sage, I found a temple.

00:32:39.459 --> 00:32:41.127
- Then go live there.

00:32:41.169 --> 00:32:42.128
Please.

00:32:49.719 --> 00:32:51.262
- Wow.

00:33:03.358 --> 00:33:04.234
Huh.

00:33:29.217 --> 00:33:29.634
Great Sage.

00:33:29.676 --> 00:33:30.510
- Huh?

00:33:30.552 --> 00:33:31.344
Whoa.

00:33:34.431 --> 00:33:35.348
- Hey look,

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:37.183
the Buddha statue came to life.

00:33:37.225 --> 00:33:38.435
- Huh?

00:33:40.687 --> 00:33:41.479
I bless you.

00:33:41.521 --> 00:33:43.732
- Whoa.

00:33:47.318 --> 00:33:48.778
- Buddha's taking this
fish as an offering.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:52.198
Stay back, the fish
is Buddha's now.

00:33:54.534 --> 00:33:56.536
Hmm?

00:34:03.501 --> 00:34:04.669
- Whoa.

00:34:17.849 --> 00:34:18.975
Oh, you were the
Buddha a second ago.

00:34:19.017 --> 00:34:21.394
You better not try
anything, you monster.

00:34:21.436 --> 00:34:23.646
That's the Great
Sage, Sun Wukong.

00:34:23.688 --> 00:34:24.522
- Great Sage?

00:34:24.564 --> 00:34:25.648
Good one.

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:26.816
No offence but
that chimp doesn't

00:34:26.858 --> 00:34:28.318
look like he's
great at anything.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.277
What about the Great Play?

00:34:31.279 --> 00:34:31.738
Huh?

00:34:33.031 --> 00:34:35.742
I mean it's a good
impression of Sun Wukong.

00:34:37.410 --> 00:34:38.495
Hold this for me.

00:34:39.579 --> 00:34:41.247
You go find some salt, okay?

00:34:42.791 --> 00:34:44.542
I'll prove that this Great Sage
is nothing but a Great Fake.

00:34:44.584 --> 00:34:47.462
Let me lay some Pork
fu on you, fudgy.

00:34:51.424 --> 00:34:53.343
Watch this,

00:34:53.385 --> 00:34:54.594
I'll make it spicy.

00:35:20.495 --> 00:35:21.621
It is him.

00:35:24.332 --> 00:35:25.375
- Ow.

00:35:25.417 --> 00:35:27.293
- You stinking flea bag.

00:35:27.335 --> 00:35:29.337
You're the reason I
came crashing down

00:35:29.379 --> 00:35:30.463
here in the first place.

00:35:31.381 --> 00:35:32.298
Stuck in this,

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.466
this body.

00:35:34.718 --> 00:35:36.720
500 years with this
pig snout on my face.

00:35:36.761 --> 00:35:39.472
- Yeah, real handy
to hang on to, right?

00:35:39.514 --> 00:35:40.807
- Huh?

00:35:46.521 --> 00:35:47.522
Are you runnin' away?

00:35:47.564 --> 00:35:49.357
It's 'cause you're
scared, you're.

00:35:52.485 --> 00:35:53.611
- He can't hear you.

00:35:56.406 --> 00:35:58.408
- And don't you come back.

00:35:58.450 --> 00:35:59.325
You just got lucky.

00:36:00.535 --> 00:36:01.619
- Oh wow.

00:36:01.661 --> 00:36:02.746
You're really scared of him.

00:36:02.787 --> 00:36:04.539
- No I'm not.

00:36:04.581 --> 00:36:06.332
I'm giving him a head
start just to be fair.

00:36:06.374 --> 00:36:07.876
You know.

00:36:07.917 --> 00:36:09.461
- He's so far gone,

00:36:09.502 --> 00:36:11.379
I doubt you could
even find him now.

00:36:11.421 --> 00:36:12.505
- What?

00:36:12.547 --> 00:36:14.466
No way.

00:36:14.507 --> 00:36:16.676
I'll have you know, I've
led armies of thousands.

00:36:16.718 --> 00:36:18.553
I can transform in
anything I want.

00:36:18.595 --> 00:36:20.513
And with this nose,

00:36:20.555 --> 00:36:22.640
I can track that stinky
monkey for miles.

00:36:22.682 --> 00:36:25.352
He can't get away
from me, no way.

00:36:25.393 --> 00:36:26.895
Watch and learn.

00:36:26.936 --> 00:36:30.357
I'll turn myself into a panther
and hunt down that hairball.

00:36:30.398 --> 00:36:30.940
Whoa.

00:36:33.902 --> 00:36:34.944
Meow.

00:36:34.986 --> 00:36:36.529
- Huh, really?

00:36:36.571 --> 00:36:37.530
- I'm a panther.

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:39.532
- It's actually
better than the pig.

00:36:39.574 --> 00:36:40.450
Alright, let's go.

00:36:40.492 --> 00:36:42.410
Follow that monkey.

00:36:42.452 --> 00:36:43.370
- This way.

00:36:43.411 --> 00:36:43.745
- Huh?

00:36:43.787 --> 00:36:44.537
- Yeah.

00:36:44.579 --> 00:36:45.705
- Hold on.

00:36:45.747 --> 00:36:47.540
You're running in
the wrong direction.

00:37:07.435 --> 00:37:08.478
- I feel something.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:08.978
Oh.

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.397
I gotta go.

00:37:16.027 --> 00:37:17.696
- Ew.

00:37:17.737 --> 00:37:19.698
Hey, Great Sage.

00:37:19.739 --> 00:37:21.616
He's over on the other side.

00:37:21.658 --> 00:37:22.951
You found him, he's right there.

00:37:24.619 --> 00:37:25.704
Master Sun Wukong.

00:37:25.745 --> 00:37:26.663
Wait for us.

00:37:26.705 --> 00:37:27.914
- Let go I'm a delicate panther.

00:37:27.956 --> 00:37:29.582
- We almost lost you out there.

00:37:31.459 --> 00:37:32.127
Your friend the panther,

00:37:32.168 --> 00:37:33.586
wants to challenge you.

00:37:33.628 --> 00:37:34.796
Huh?

00:37:35.839 --> 00:37:37.632
That's weird he was just here.

00:37:38.758 --> 00:37:40.593
It seemed like he knew you.

00:37:40.635 --> 00:37:42.721
Is he a friend of yours?

00:37:42.762 --> 00:37:45.640
Great Sage, is he
really a Buddha?

00:37:45.682 --> 00:37:47.434
Or is he just pretending?

00:37:47.475 --> 00:37:48.268
'Cause he seems like a.

00:37:48.309 --> 00:37:48.768
Wait, let me guess,

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:49.644
a pig?

00:37:49.686 --> 00:37:50.103
- Yeah.

00:37:51.646 --> 00:37:52.897
- Believe me, a pig
is an improvement.

00:37:55.483 --> 00:37:56.651
I gotta admit,

00:37:56.693 --> 00:37:58.611
it's pretty cool how
he can transform.

00:37:58.653 --> 00:38:00.447
He can't do
it for very long.

00:38:00.488 --> 00:38:01.614
Only as long as a breath

00:38:01.656 --> 00:38:02.949
and then boom, back to pig.

00:38:04.659 --> 00:38:05.994
- There you are.

00:38:06.036 --> 00:38:07.787
Where you behind
us this whole time?

00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:09.622
I thought you ran away.

00:38:09.664 --> 00:38:12.000
- Come back to get thrown
by your nose again?

00:38:12.042 --> 00:38:12.876
Huh?

00:38:14.794 --> 00:38:15.879
- Huh?

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.506
- Great, two of them.

00:38:19.674 --> 00:38:20.633
- This is so neat.

00:38:20.675 --> 00:38:22.469
It's another me.

00:38:24.929 --> 00:38:26.639
His belly's bigger.

00:38:34.731 --> 00:38:35.982
That was so cool, do it again.

00:38:43.698 --> 00:38:44.908
You guys, look.

00:38:50.955 --> 00:38:52.665
- Get away from there.

00:39:11.101 --> 00:39:12.727
Stay back.

00:39:17.774 --> 00:39:19.025
Nobody move.

00:39:22.737 --> 00:39:23.780
Stop.

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:26.908
I said don't move.

00:39:41.172 --> 00:39:42.716
- You did it.

00:39:42.757 --> 00:39:43.967
Whoa.

00:39:44.009 --> 00:39:45.677
You really scared him away.

00:39:45.719 --> 00:39:47.846
- You realize that
was a White Dragon?

00:39:47.887 --> 00:39:50.640
See one of those and it's the
last thing you'll ever see.

00:39:53.226 --> 00:39:55.562
- Why you suddenly
care about us?

00:39:56.813 --> 00:39:58.023
- It's your fault.

00:39:58.064 --> 00:40:00.066
I'll show you you
meddling swine,

00:40:00.108 --> 00:40:01.735
dragons love pig.

00:40:01.776 --> 00:40:02.819
- Don't do this.

00:40:02.861 --> 00:40:03.737
Help me kid.

00:40:03.778 --> 00:40:04.779
- Please stop it.

00:40:04.821 --> 00:40:05.864
Let him go.

00:40:05.905 --> 00:40:07.032
- Let him go?

00:40:07.073 --> 00:40:07.991
- It was my fault,
I didn't listen.

00:40:08.033 --> 00:40:08.783
- Wonder if pigs can fly.

00:40:08.825 --> 00:40:09.993
- Don't.

00:40:10.035 --> 00:40:11.077
- He'll just turn into
a bird or something.

00:40:13.038 --> 00:40:14.748
- But what if he doesn't?

00:40:23.631 --> 00:40:25.592
If you let me go,
I'll help you with the dragon.

00:40:25.633 --> 00:40:27.218
- The dragon, look, he's flying.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:28.762
- Wait.

00:40:28.803 --> 00:40:29.763
You don't
wanna take on a dragon

00:40:29.804 --> 00:40:30.764
while holding on
to a pig, right?

00:40:40.899 --> 00:40:42.776
- Wow.

00:40:44.861 --> 00:40:46.821
Dragons can really fly.

00:40:46.863 --> 00:40:48.948
- Yeah, that's pure freedom.

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:51.034
Soaring through the
clouds like that.

00:40:51.076 --> 00:40:53.161
- Look at that, it's
the coolest thing ever.

00:40:53.203 --> 00:40:54.120
- What's the big deal?

00:40:54.162 --> 00:40:56.122
I used to fly back in the day.

00:40:56.164 --> 00:40:58.166
- You know, if I was able to fly

00:40:58.208 --> 00:41:00.210
I'll go over that mountain,

00:41:00.251 --> 00:41:02.796
and take this little
one back home.

00:41:02.837 --> 00:41:04.756
And find my Sifu.

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.677
- Someday, if you're
brave and strong enough

00:41:08.718 --> 00:41:10.095
you can.

00:41:11.221 --> 00:41:13.848
Then you can go as
far as you want.

00:41:14.683 --> 00:41:15.642
- Huh?

00:41:15.684 --> 00:41:16.810
Are you serious?

00:41:16.851 --> 00:41:18.186
Is that really possible?

00:41:19.229 --> 00:41:20.230
- Maybe,

00:41:20.271 --> 00:41:21.815
if you don't annoy me.

00:41:23.066 --> 00:41:25.276
- Wait so does that
mean you flew before?

00:41:26.236 --> 00:41:27.195
Have you ridden with a dragon?

00:41:27.237 --> 00:41:28.238
Like a teammate?

00:41:28.279 --> 00:41:28.988
Can you teach me?

00:41:29.989 --> 00:41:30.949
One question at a time.

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:32.200
Just one last one.

00:41:32.242 --> 00:41:34.744
Are there many
dragons in this world?

00:41:34.786 --> 00:41:37.789
Wherever there's
water, there're dragons.

00:41:37.831 --> 00:41:41.710
* As a man that's
lost in the sea

00:41:42.752 --> 00:41:46.965
* Wondering about his destiny

00:41:47.966 --> 00:41:51.720
* Like a baby bird
outside his nest

00:41:53.138 --> 00:41:57.017
* Dreams about what comes next

00:41:58.059 --> 00:42:02.731
* As a pebble that's
thown into a stream

00:42:03.898 --> 00:42:07.277
* Sinking sand
all there is to be

00:42:08.903 --> 00:42:12.240
* Awaiting rescue from up above

00:42:14.034 --> 00:42:17.871
* To list lift me
up with your love

00:42:20.373 --> 00:42:24.169
* You're running like thunder

00:42:25.795 --> 00:42:30.091
* Sparkling like fire

00:42:31.301 --> 00:42:34.012
* With distance
across the starry sky

00:42:34.054 --> 00:42:36.723
* Flashing rays of hope

00:42:36.765 --> 00:42:41.061
* With the brave
heart you've given me

00:42:41.102 --> 00:42:46.107
* We're soaring like eagles

00:42:47.192 --> 00:42:51.071
* We're shining like rainbows

00:42:52.197 --> 00:42:55.033
* We're riding like the panther

00:42:55.075 --> 00:42:57.285
* Jumping like the whale

00:42:57.327 --> 00:43:01.081
* Leaping like a lion

00:43:01.122 --> 00:43:04.209
* With the brave heart
you've given me *

00:43:05.335 --> 00:43:08.004
Look, there's
a building over there.

00:43:08.046 --> 00:43:09.047
- Huh?

00:43:10.173 --> 00:43:12.133
I wonder if they'll
have a kitchen.

00:43:12.175 --> 00:43:13.760
Some noodles.

00:43:15.887 --> 00:43:18.098
Woo hoo.

00:43:21.142 --> 00:43:23.311
Hey Sage, what're
you waiting for?

00:43:34.823 --> 00:43:36.866
Come on, don't let
piggy beat you.

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.245
- Don't say a word.

00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:43.248
Hmm.

00:43:46.376 --> 00:43:47.377
Hello.

00:43:49.462 --> 00:43:51.381
- Oh, I do need to visit
the little pig's room.

00:43:51.423 --> 00:43:53.174
- It's awfully quiet.

00:43:53.216 --> 00:43:54.217
Is anyone home?

00:43:57.971 --> 00:43:59.264
It looks like an inn.

00:44:01.307 --> 00:44:02.809
Why isn't anyone here?

00:44:04.185 --> 00:44:05.145
- I'm right.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.864
- Oh, oh, ooh.

00:44:17.407 --> 00:44:18.950
Are those carrots?

00:44:22.287 --> 00:44:24.247
- What was that?

00:44:27.208 --> 00:44:29.336
Hello, we'd like to
stay here at your inn.

00:44:31.171 --> 00:44:33.173
There are three of us and
our baby, is that okay?

00:44:33.214 --> 00:44:34.174
- I can't talk.

00:44:35.216 --> 00:44:36.301
- But you just did.

00:44:36.343 --> 00:44:37.260
You said.

00:44:37.302 --> 00:44:39.304
- Oh you're just too cute.

00:44:40.305 --> 00:44:41.348
It was a joke.

00:44:41.389 --> 00:44:43.433
That being said,
he's not that smart.

00:44:45.977 --> 00:44:47.145
If I may ask,

00:44:47.187 --> 00:44:48.855
where are you and
your friends headed?

00:44:48.897 --> 00:44:49.856
- We're headed to the Capital.

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:53.068
- What a cute little baby girl.

00:44:56.321 --> 00:44:57.906
Hurry up and get tea.

00:44:59.199 --> 00:45:02.369
Now, I'm afraid that I
have some bad news for you.

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:04.954
They've closed the
roads to the Capital

00:45:04.996 --> 00:45:06.373
so there's no way
you can get there.

00:45:08.291 --> 00:45:10.418
- They're not carrots.

00:45:16.591 --> 00:45:18.343
- It's a monster, it's a
monster, it's a monster.

00:45:19.386 --> 00:45:20.345
Act scared.

00:45:20.387 --> 00:45:22.055
- Oh, it's a monster.

00:45:23.515 --> 00:45:25.475
- It's okay, don't be
afraid, they're not monsters.

00:45:28.228 --> 00:45:29.479
- But they're not people.

00:45:29.521 --> 00:45:31.356
- That doesn't
make them monsters.

00:45:31.398 --> 00:45:33.233
- I'm pretty sure the
monkey's a monster.

00:45:33.274 --> 00:45:34.401
- Quiet, pork rind.

00:45:34.442 --> 00:45:35.443
- They'll stay out of your way.

00:45:35.485 --> 00:45:37.195
We're only staying one night

00:45:37.237 --> 00:45:38.363
and we'll be leaving first
thing in the morning.

00:45:38.405 --> 00:45:39.447
- You promise?

00:45:39.489 --> 00:45:41.199
- Uh huh.

00:45:41.241 --> 00:45:44.077
- Alright then,
follow me please.

00:45:44.119 --> 00:45:45.370
- Thank you.

00:45:47.372 --> 00:45:48.248
- Tea?

00:45:49.124 --> 00:45:50.208
- Hot tea.

00:45:51.376 --> 00:45:52.460
- That's okay.

00:45:52.502 --> 00:45:55.296
- Hey you, quit
making me look stupid.

00:45:56.965 --> 00:45:58.466
- Now, if you need
anything at all

00:45:58.508 --> 00:46:01.052
don't hesitate to ask, okay?

00:46:01.094 --> 00:46:02.095
- Huh?

00:46:02.137 --> 00:46:04.097
Sure.

00:46:07.475 --> 00:46:08.268
- Oh?

00:46:09.269 --> 00:46:11.104
I'll leave you alone now.

00:46:11.146 --> 00:46:14.441
If you need me I'll be
right outside your door.

00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:20.447
Why are you standing there?

00:46:20.488 --> 00:46:22.282
Get to work.

00:46:22.323 --> 00:46:23.241
- What's wrong with her?

00:46:23.283 --> 00:46:24.451
Why is she crying?

00:46:24.492 --> 00:46:26.244
- Go chee go, don't cry.

00:46:26.286 --> 00:46:28.079
- I've got this.

00:46:33.543 --> 00:46:35.128
Bul ya ya, oh.

00:46:38.298 --> 00:46:42.385
- Oh yeah, look I have my
very own Great Sage too.

00:46:42.427 --> 00:46:44.179
Would you like it?

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:45.513
With him to protect you,

00:46:45.555 --> 00:46:48.308
you won't need to be
afraid of anything.

00:47:06.076 --> 00:47:07.202
- Time for bed.

00:47:10.663 --> 00:47:12.499
- What a moron.

00:47:36.147 --> 00:47:37.607
- It's really quiet here.

00:47:39.067 --> 00:47:41.569
I got used to the
sounds in the forest.

00:47:41.611 --> 00:47:45.323
And so, it's a
little to sleep now.

00:47:45.365 --> 00:47:47.367
- Works better for me.

00:47:47.409 --> 00:47:48.660
You snore anyway kid.

00:47:49.411 --> 00:47:51.037
- That's true.

00:47:51.079 --> 00:47:52.080
Hey Great Sage,

00:47:52.122 --> 00:47:54.082
you know when I find my Sifu

00:47:54.124 --> 00:47:56.543
and we get the little
one back to her home,

00:47:56.584 --> 00:47:59.045
where will you go?

00:47:59.087 --> 00:48:00.505
- Huaguo Hill.

00:48:00.547 --> 00:48:01.673
- Huaguo Hill?

00:48:01.715 --> 00:48:03.383
I know that place.

00:48:04.426 --> 00:48:05.635
It's in all those stories.

00:48:05.677 --> 00:48:08.263
And the story says, it's
green and beautiful,

00:48:08.304 --> 00:48:10.348
full of trees and
flowers and fruit.

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:11.224
It's,

00:48:11.266 --> 00:48:13.601
it's a magical place.

00:48:13.643 --> 00:48:17.272
And they also say
that peaches there are

00:48:17.313 --> 00:48:18.648
this large.

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:20.442
- You believe
everything people say?

00:48:25.739 --> 00:48:27.198
Actually,

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:28.658
the peaches are as
big as your head.

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:30.160
- Huh?

00:48:30.201 --> 00:48:32.412
Even bigger than this?

00:48:34.664 --> 00:48:36.416
Then is it far?

00:48:36.458 --> 00:48:37.584
How do you get there?

00:48:37.625 --> 00:48:39.419
- It's thousands of miles away.

00:48:39.461 --> 00:48:42.505
- It'd take forever.

00:48:42.547 --> 00:48:46.092
But for a great warrior
like you it's not that far.

00:48:46.134 --> 00:48:47.135
- Yeah.

00:48:47.177 --> 00:48:50.263
I could do it in
one leap, then I.

00:48:52.724 --> 00:48:55.393
At least I used to.

00:48:55.435 --> 00:48:59.230
- Great Sage, you don't
need to worry, you'll see.

00:48:59.272 --> 00:49:01.608
You'll make it home.

00:49:01.649 --> 00:49:04.110
As long as you
always do your best.

00:49:05.737 --> 00:49:07.072
If it helps you,

00:49:07.113 --> 00:49:09.240
I'll pray that you get all
your magic powers back.

00:49:13.787 --> 00:49:16.706
- Thanks a lot kid but
I doubt that'd help.

00:49:16.748 --> 00:49:19.125
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

00:49:19.167 --> 00:49:20.335
I haven't always been good

00:49:20.377 --> 00:49:22.337
so now I'm being grounded and.

00:49:33.348 --> 00:49:35.183
Just as well.

00:50:46.254 --> 00:50:47.672
- What're you doing in here?

00:50:49.966 --> 00:50:51.718
What is wrong with you?

00:50:52.886 --> 00:50:58.308
Oh, you were trying to steal
food again, weren't you?

00:50:59.267 --> 00:51:00.226
No food untill we
finish the job.

00:51:02.812 --> 00:51:05.273
Hurry up, don't make
me go back in there.

00:51:08.276 --> 00:51:10.653
This is no time to
be fooling around.

00:51:10.695 --> 00:51:12.781
Let's go.

00:51:22.791 --> 00:51:23.708
You know.

00:51:25.293 --> 00:51:27.545
There's something
I find strange.

00:51:27.587 --> 00:51:30.256
Why was it necessary
to transform us?

00:51:30.298 --> 00:51:33.343
It takes energy
to look like this.

00:51:35.845 --> 00:51:37.430
I find it annoying.

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:40.517
I don't like this look.

00:51:40.558 --> 00:51:42.811
Well answer me.

00:51:42.852 --> 00:51:44.521
If it were up to me,

00:51:44.562 --> 00:51:47.440
I'd go up there right now
and smash their puny heads.

00:51:48.441 --> 00:51:50.568
Hey, where do you
think you're going?

00:51:52.612 --> 00:51:54.280
You can not go up
there right now.

00:51:54.322 --> 00:51:56.783
This is really
for your own good.

00:51:56.825 --> 00:51:58.326
Listen, if you ruin this for me.

00:51:58.368 --> 00:51:59.828
Wait.

00:51:59.869 --> 00:52:02.330
You have to focus or the Evil
Lord will have our hides.

00:52:02.372 --> 00:52:04.374
Hey, what is wrong with you?

00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:09.587
It was you.

00:52:09.629 --> 00:52:11.339
You'll pay for this.

00:52:12.382 --> 00:52:13.675
- Hai ya.

00:52:18.513 --> 00:52:20.765
Well, I had a feeling the
service here would be terrible.

00:52:43.747 --> 00:52:45.331
Get back.

00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:13.485
Let me wipe that
smile off your face.

00:53:17.572 --> 00:53:18.698
Just get in line.

00:53:19.741 --> 00:53:21.701
Then you'll all get a turn.

00:53:23.703 --> 00:53:25.538
Smile lady.

00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:28.500
I think we need to do
some remodeling in here.

00:53:28.541 --> 00:53:30.835
Open up the walls,
let in some light.

00:53:32.545 --> 00:53:34.839
- You're not planning
on leaving now, are you?

00:53:59.823 --> 00:54:01.032
- Thought I'd swing by.

00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:10.625
- Whoa.

00:54:10.667 --> 00:54:11.960
- Save the kids.

00:54:20.635 --> 00:54:21.511
- Hey you hit my bacon.

00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:34.691
- Run.

00:54:39.654 --> 00:54:40.655
Don't wait on me.

00:54:41.656 --> 00:54:42.949
- But Great Sage.

00:54:50.832 --> 00:54:51.958
- Hey you two.

00:55:06.014 --> 00:55:06.890
We gotta go.

00:55:22.697 --> 00:55:25.825
Great Sage,
we're over here, hurry.

00:55:38.963 --> 00:55:40.674
- Looks like we're
going sailing.

00:55:40.715 --> 00:55:42.801
All aboard.

00:55:42.842 --> 00:55:43.968
Let's go.

00:55:50.684 --> 00:55:51.142
Hurry.

00:56:33.768 --> 00:56:35.020
Hot, hot.

00:56:41.026 --> 00:56:42.610
- Here.

00:57:03.131 --> 00:57:04.799
You okay?

00:57:13.183 --> 00:57:14.976
Great Sage, look.

00:57:35.038 --> 00:57:36.831
Leave her alone.

00:57:44.047 --> 00:57:46.174
- I hope your Great
Sage is a great swimmer.

00:57:46.216 --> 00:57:49.678
But I hear monkeys
don't like water.

00:57:51.846 --> 00:57:52.972
- Huh?

00:57:57.686 --> 00:58:00.730
- Hasn't anyone told you
it's not nice to bite?

00:58:13.743 --> 00:58:17.664
Sun Wukong, you're
laying down on the job.

00:59:07.047 --> 00:59:10.050
- Great Sage, we have
to save the little one.

00:59:10.091 --> 00:59:11.760
Come on.

00:59:11.801 --> 00:59:13.720
- She's not my problem.

00:59:14.763 --> 00:59:15.764
- No you don't mean that.

00:59:15.805 --> 00:59:16.723
- Neither are you.

00:59:16.765 --> 00:59:18.183
I just need to go my own way.

00:59:18.224 --> 00:59:20.018
You can take care
of her yourself.

00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:22.187
- No we can't, you know.

00:59:22.228 --> 00:59:23.813
- You want to be the hero?

00:59:23.855 --> 00:59:25.357
- Uh uh.

00:59:25.398 --> 00:59:28.818
- Go ahead then, I didn't ask
to be saddled with any of you.

00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:35.075
- But, you are the
protector, the legends say.

00:59:38.411 --> 00:59:41.122
Fine I'll go by myself.

00:59:42.999 --> 00:59:43.917
- What?

00:59:43.958 --> 00:59:45.377
No wait, don't go.

00:59:45.418 --> 00:59:49.089
Sun Wukong look, go after him.

00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:51.174
Hello?

01:00:39.264 --> 01:00:40.890
We better hurry.

01:00:40.932 --> 01:00:43.977
Or we'll miss the
sacrifice of the children.

01:00:45.228 --> 01:00:48.189
That cursed monkey.

01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:02.245
- Ow.

01:01:38.406 --> 01:01:40.408
Great Sage?

01:01:40.450 --> 01:01:43.286
We have to save the little one.

01:01:43.328 --> 01:01:46.081
- I didn't ask for this.

01:01:46.122 --> 01:01:47.874
I don't want this.

01:01:47.916 --> 01:01:52.253
These people are
nothing but trouble.

01:01:52.295 --> 01:01:54.214
Great Sage?

01:01:54.255 --> 01:01:56.424
Great Sage?

01:01:57.926 --> 01:02:01.137
Look, I have my favorite
little Great Sage too.

01:02:01.179 --> 01:02:02.931
You like it?

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.190
Him as your protector,

01:02:12.232 --> 01:02:14.442
you won't need to be
afraid of anything.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:17.070
- Monkey?

01:02:17.112 --> 01:02:17.904
Monkey?

01:02:17.946 --> 01:02:19.072
Hello?

01:02:19.114 --> 01:02:20.990
Now's no time for a swim.

01:02:21.032 --> 01:02:23.243
Is this how the
Great Sage would act?

01:02:23.284 --> 01:02:25.245
No.

01:02:25.286 --> 01:02:28.289
I know, I know you're upset.

01:02:33.378 --> 01:02:36.089
Those kids need you.

01:02:38.049 --> 01:02:40.427
- My new teacher, Sun Wukong.

01:02:40.468 --> 01:02:43.388
The king of the monkeys,
who can't be beat.

01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:45.223
You're also immortal.

01:02:45.265 --> 01:02:46.474
So you can protect us.

01:02:46.516 --> 01:02:48.351
But the coolest thing you can do

01:02:48.393 --> 01:02:50.937
is leap over clouds.

01:03:18.465 --> 01:03:19.299
- Hey piggy.

01:03:19.341 --> 01:03:20.467
- Huh?

01:03:20.508 --> 01:03:23.053
- We've got kids to save.

01:03:27.557 --> 01:03:29.351
- Today before the eclipse,

01:03:30.685 --> 01:03:34.105
we will finally taste
the fruits of our labor.

01:03:36.024 --> 01:03:37.567
Rejoice.

01:03:41.488 --> 01:03:44.574
We seek immortality.

01:03:49.079 --> 01:03:52.582
By harnessing the
power of the pure souls

01:03:52.624 --> 01:03:55.418
of 100 children,

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:58.421
my quest for eternal
life, will ironically

01:03:58.463 --> 01:04:00.256
come to an end.

01:04:02.050 --> 01:04:04.177
I will be

01:04:04.219 --> 01:04:06.179
unstoppable.

01:04:52.434 --> 01:04:54.227
- You're such a fool.

01:04:54.269 --> 01:04:56.229
You lost him, useless.

01:04:56.271 --> 01:04:58.481
He's mine.

01:05:03.194 --> 01:05:05.655
Think you're a tough guy huh?

01:05:05.697 --> 01:05:08.074
You'll have to do
better than that.

01:05:25.675 --> 01:05:28.428
- Liuer, are you alright?

01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:30.472
- Sifu, why are you here?

01:05:30.513 --> 01:05:33.266
- I only had to search heaven
and earth just to find you.

01:05:33.308 --> 01:05:34.642
If we ever get out of here,

01:05:34.684 --> 01:05:36.644
you have to promise to be
a good boy from now on.

01:05:36.686 --> 01:05:39.564
- Don't worry, I promise
I'll cook and clean for you.

01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:43.151
- You can't lie
to a monk you now,

01:05:43.193 --> 01:05:44.694
it's bad for your karma.

01:05:48.198 --> 01:05:50.283
I knew you were lying.

01:05:50.325 --> 01:05:51.701
That's why you should
never lie, Jiang.

01:05:57.707 --> 01:05:59.125
- Sifu look.

01:05:59.167 --> 01:06:00.460
- We found all the children.

01:06:09.344 --> 01:06:11.680
- Why are you just
standing around?

01:06:12.722 --> 01:06:14.182
Behind you.

01:06:57.726 --> 01:06:59.477
- Sifu.

01:07:02.355 --> 01:07:03.648
You're okay.

01:07:14.451 --> 01:07:15.744
- It's the moon, we better get.

01:07:19.330 --> 01:07:21.291
- Enough.

01:07:21.332 --> 01:07:23.376
Why are you always
getting in my way?

01:07:27.672 --> 01:07:29.299
- Let him go.

01:07:33.303 --> 01:07:35.221
- How dare you you
ruin this for me.

01:07:35.263 --> 01:07:37.265
- How dare you
steal little kids.

01:07:37.891 --> 01:07:39.517
- Where is Sun Wukong?

01:07:40.894 --> 01:07:42.562
Where?

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.590
- Great Sage.

01:08:52.632 --> 01:08:54.592
He came to rescue us.

01:08:54.634 --> 01:08:57.429
- I can't believe it,
it's the Monkey King.

01:09:01.391 --> 01:09:04.477
- You're just a stinking monkey.

01:09:05.395 --> 01:09:08.356
- Listen up, I'm
the Monkey King.

01:09:08.398 --> 01:09:09.816
I'm here for what's mine.

01:09:09.858 --> 01:09:10.859
- Me too.

01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:13.403
I'm the Pagoda King.

01:09:13.445 --> 01:09:16.823
And I, you're all
gonna get raked.

01:09:19.743 --> 01:09:20.952
This little piggy
went to battle.

01:09:20.994 --> 01:09:22.620
No wait, he's
too powerful for you.

01:09:54.402 --> 01:09:56.821
- You're no threat to me.

01:10:04.037 --> 01:10:06.581
- I'm not letting
you near those kids.

01:10:36.945 --> 01:10:38.571
- Great Sage.

01:10:48.748 --> 01:10:53.712
- Sun Wukong, the legends
say you are immortal.

01:10:53.753 --> 01:10:55.630
Time to put that to the test.

01:10:55.672 --> 01:10:56.506
Wait a second.

01:10:57.465 --> 01:10:59.592
- Huh?

01:10:59.634 --> 01:11:01.886
- The legends say
a lot of things.

01:11:01.928 --> 01:11:04.055
Let's test them

01:11:04.097 --> 01:11:06.016
all.

01:11:08.935 --> 01:11:10.603
- Yeah.

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.606
Where'd he go?

01:12:24.761 --> 01:12:27.055
- Let me go.

01:12:39.567 --> 01:12:40.985
- Great Sage?

01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:47.784
- No sweat kid.

01:12:47.826 --> 01:12:50.704
All in a day's work.

01:12:50.745 --> 01:12:52.747
Just need to catch my breath.

01:12:52.789 --> 01:12:53.540
You did great.

01:12:53.581 --> 01:12:54.833
- Yeah.

01:12:55.792 --> 01:12:57.919
- Liuer, I think you lost this.

01:13:01.756 --> 01:13:03.717
Oh no.

01:13:03.758 --> 01:13:05.760
I got a bad feeling.

01:13:35.874 --> 01:13:37.042
- Oh, oh.

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:48.094
Run son, run.

01:13:54.809 --> 01:13:56.811
Don't look son, just run.

01:15:07.298 --> 01:15:09.217
- Look after her, I"m
gonna go help him.

01:15:09.259 --> 01:15:11.052
- Liuer.

01:15:14.055 --> 01:15:15.932
Be careful.

01:15:15.974 --> 01:15:17.100
- Yes.

01:15:32.907 --> 01:15:34.701
Great Sage.

01:15:34.743 --> 01:15:35.827
What can I do to help you?

01:15:35.869 --> 01:15:36.953
- What're you doing here?

01:15:36.995 --> 01:15:38.079
I'm trying to protect you.

01:15:38.121 --> 01:15:39.080
Get out of her.

01:15:39.122 --> 01:15:39.789
- But.

01:15:39.831 --> 01:15:40.999
- Go.

01:15:41.041 --> 01:15:43.168
- But, then who's
gonna protect you?

01:15:45.295 --> 01:15:49.049
- No one ever has
but I'll be alright,

01:15:49.090 --> 01:15:51.009
so you don't need to worry.

01:15:51.051 --> 01:15:53.094
- I won't.

01:15:56.264 --> 01:15:58.183
Great Sage.

01:15:59.059 --> 01:16:00.101
- What're you doing?

01:16:00.143 --> 01:16:01.102
I told you to go.

01:16:06.316 --> 01:16:07.150
What're you gonna do?

01:16:07.192 --> 01:16:08.068
Break his teeth?

01:16:08.109 --> 01:16:09.903
- Take that.

01:16:17.202 --> 01:16:18.995
- Run Liuer.

01:16:28.088 --> 01:16:31.007
- You're just a big worm,
I'm not afraid of you.

01:16:31.049 --> 01:16:32.884
Come get me.

01:17:18.013 --> 01:17:19.180
- Hang on Liuer.

01:17:26.187 --> 01:17:27.230
I'm coming.

01:17:32.861 --> 01:17:34.154
I told you I didn't
need your help.

01:17:34.195 --> 01:17:36.239
Why don't you ever listen to me?

01:17:47.042 --> 01:17:48.251
- Great Sage.

01:18:43.223 --> 01:18:45.350
- You're okay, you're okay.

01:18:45.392 --> 01:18:48.895
I can save you, I
can save you, I can.

01:21:57.292 --> 01:21:58.668
- Great Sage.

01:22:09.763 --> 01:22:10.638
Great Sage.
