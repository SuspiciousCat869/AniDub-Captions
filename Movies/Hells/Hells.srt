1
00:00:08,893 --> 00:00:11,893
(lively jazz music)

2
00:00:38,903 --> 00:00:43,903
(bats fluttering) (eerie music)

3
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,658
Hey, do you know why people die?

4
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:52,419
[Demon] They die because they live.

5
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,898
[Angel] Okay, so where
do they go after they die?

6
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:58,399
[Demon] They all go to Hell!

7
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:14,568
Crap, I'm gonna be late!

8
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:19,526
[Mother] Rinne, would you slow down?

9
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,234
- Sweetie.
- Oh hey mama.

10
00:01:24,235 --> 00:01:26,885
Have some decency, don't
talk with your mouth full.

11
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:29,565
Sorry, I was just in a hurry.

12
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:31,242
Look, I'll finish it right now.

13
00:01:31,243 --> 00:01:32,486
(gulps)

14
00:01:32,487 --> 00:01:33,575
[Mother] You're so scatterbrained.

15
00:01:33,576 --> 00:01:35,985
You even forgot my gift
for your first day.

16
00:01:35,986 --> 00:01:38,295
[Rinne Voiceover] Yeah, I
forgot, let's go with that.

17
00:01:38,296 --> 00:01:40,985
[Rinne] Okay, thanks, mama.

18
00:01:40,986 --> 00:01:42,185
I'll see you at home!

19
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:45,245
I'm gonna go make like a
hundred friends at school!

20
00:01:45,246 --> 00:01:46,345
I believe in you!

21
00:01:46,346 --> 00:01:49,505
Just behave in front of your new teachers!

22
00:01:49,506 --> 00:01:50,925
No matter where the school is,

23
00:01:50,926 --> 00:01:53,535
she's always late on her first day.

24
00:01:53,536 --> 00:01:55,489
I bet I know where she got that from.

25
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:57,408
[Mother Voiceover] Darling,

26
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,159
please protect our little girl.

27
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:05,170
(grunts) If I wasn't late
before, I definitely am now.

28
00:02:05,171 --> 00:02:07,705
Stupid notebook!

29
00:02:07,706 --> 00:02:08,706
What was that?

30
00:02:09,873 --> 00:02:11,502
I'm so sorry!

31
00:02:11,503 --> 00:02:15,160
Are you okay? (heartbeat)

32
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:16,775
I don't have time to sit around

33
00:02:16,776 --> 00:02:18,665
and stare into your big brown eyes.

34
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,089
Forget I said that!

35
00:02:20,976 --> 00:02:22,785
But heck if he wasn't cute though.

36
00:02:22,786 --> 00:02:25,075
Wonder if he goes to my school?

37
00:02:25,076 --> 00:02:26,755
What if we fell in love?

38
00:02:26,756 --> 00:02:29,015
Am I his type? Is he my type?

39
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:30,869
Wait, is he late for school too?

40
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,615
Look what we got here.

41
00:02:33,616 --> 00:02:35,105
You crossed the wrong path.

42
00:02:35,106 --> 00:02:37,005
Black cats are servants of Satan.

43
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:38,155
[Boy] So that means.

44
00:02:38,156 --> 00:02:40,245
[Boy] We got to send it back to Hell!

45
00:02:40,246 --> 00:02:41,246
[Boy] Kill it dead!

46
00:02:41,246 --> 00:02:42,246
[Both Boys] Kill it dead kill it dead

47
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:43,962
kill it dead kill it dead!

48
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,963
(wheels screeching)

49
00:02:49,243 --> 00:02:50,993
[Man] Stupid bitch!

50
00:02:53,903 --> 00:02:55,359
(groans) Oh jeez.

51
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:58,755
There you are, safe and sound.

52
00:02:58,756 --> 00:03:01,455
Make sure to look both
ways next time, okay?

53
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:02,456
Later!

54
00:03:05,013 --> 00:03:06,704
I've got to get going now.

55
00:03:06,705 --> 00:03:10,538
(wheels screeching and crash)

56
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:18,224
(heavy breathing)
(rapid footsteps)

57
00:03:18,225 --> 00:03:19,535
This is bad, I'm so late!

58
00:03:19,536 --> 00:03:21,824
The gate is gonna close any second!

59
00:03:21,825 --> 00:03:26,018
Wait for me!

60
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:29,733
And she's safe! (laughs)

61
00:03:29,734 --> 00:03:33,145
Ow, not again, come on.

62
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,199
Are you all right?

63
00:03:35,226 --> 00:03:39,089
Goodness, what's a young lady
like yourself doing over here?

64
00:03:41,024 --> 00:03:42,965
Stop ignoring us Ryu Kutou!

65
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:45,125
We're here for fighting, not flirting!

66
00:03:45,126 --> 00:03:46,695
You're in the men's quarter.

67
00:03:46,696 --> 00:03:48,368
The women's is over that way.

68
00:03:48,369 --> 00:03:49,715
Oh well that makes sense.

69
00:03:49,716 --> 00:03:51,058
Thank you so much!

70
00:03:51,059 --> 00:03:52,392
Have a good day!

71
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:58,101
[Demons] Dammit, stop ignoring us Kutou!

72
00:04:02,865 --> 00:04:03,825
Is this it?

73
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,295
But it's so quiet,
class must have started.

74
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:07,296
Oh boy.

75
00:04:08,326 --> 00:04:09,159
[Rinne Voiceover] That guy though,

76
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,356
wow, total chocolate box.

77
00:04:11,357 --> 00:04:13,860
Ah, stop daydreaming about dream boats!

78
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:15,598
Face the music, girl!

79
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,599
Good morning, I'm so sorry I'm late!

80
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:28,905
[Rinne Voiceover] Wait, am
I the only one in uniform?

81
00:04:28,906 --> 00:04:31,945
Do schools in this city
not have dress codes?

82
00:04:31,946 --> 00:04:35,628
My name is Rinne Amagane,
but just Rinne is fine!

83
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:39,335
(tsks) Go die, you stupid ass bitch!

84
00:04:39,336 --> 00:04:41,052
I'll slap that smile off your face.

85
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:42,865
You're a low life like the rest of us,

86
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,425
so cut the cutesy crap.

87
00:04:44,426 --> 00:04:45,259
Cutesy?

88
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,025
I'm not pretending, I
just want to be friends

89
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:48,915
- with you guys.
- Oh?

90
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,549
And how exactly do you
plan to pull that off?

91
00:04:52,756 --> 00:04:54,675
[Rinne] Well I was.

92
00:04:54,676 --> 00:04:56,745
You thought you could just waltz in here

93
00:04:56,746 --> 00:04:58,523
and we'd all kiss your ass?

94
00:04:58,524 --> 00:04:59,380
(laughing and jeering)
Check out the

95
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:00,815
schoolgirl outfit.

96
00:05:00,816 --> 00:05:02,266
[Teacher] You little brats!

97
00:05:04,526 --> 00:05:07,646
You won't settle down,
you'll taste my whip!

98
00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:12,395
Guess class started.

99
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:16,715
[Teacher] When you lash
out, I lash in! (laughs)

100
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,830
You might think of this as physical abuse,

101
00:05:18,831 --> 00:05:21,319
but it's really divine punishment!

102
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,811
(laughing maniacally)

103
00:05:23,812 --> 00:05:26,979
Interrupting my class is unforgivable!

104
00:05:32,428 --> 00:05:35,159
Hey, you're gonna get someone killed!

105
00:05:37,006 --> 00:05:38,359
[Kiki Voiceover] Blood?

106
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,443
That's blood!

107
00:05:41,721 --> 00:05:43,585
[Girl] It's blood!

108
00:05:43,586 --> 00:05:46,659
Come on now, what's
all that rattle, baby!

109
00:05:51,342 --> 00:05:53,509
[Teacher] Master Helvis!

110
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:59,799
[Helvis] Rinne Amagane,
you are already dead.

111
00:06:00,656 --> 00:06:03,345
Welcome to Destiny Land.

112
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:06,963
You've gone and hip shuffled
straight into Hell, baby!

113
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:09,136
[Rinne Voiceover] Destiny Land?

114
00:06:09,137 --> 00:06:11,924
Like an amusement park, in Hell?

115
00:06:11,925 --> 00:06:13,508
No, I'm going home!

116
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,355
Oh?

117
00:06:16,356 --> 00:06:19,005
How will you fare the
waves of the Destiny Sea?

118
00:06:19,006 --> 00:06:21,595
In the living world it's
called the River of Death,

119
00:06:21,596 --> 00:06:23,185
Sanzu River.

120
00:06:23,186 --> 00:06:24,965
Wait, like the river Styx?

121
00:06:24,966 --> 00:06:27,295
There's no way I'm dead, just look at me!

122
00:06:27,296 --> 00:06:29,640
I'm still flesh and blood and limbs!

123
00:06:29,641 --> 00:06:30,546
Whoop-de-do!

124
00:06:30,547 --> 00:06:33,155
The truth is like the sun, baby.

125
00:06:33,156 --> 00:06:35,024
Shuttin' it out won't make it go away.

126
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:37,468
And even if it is all a mistake,

127
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:39,835
as long as you're rockin'
in this jailhouse,

128
00:06:39,836 --> 00:06:42,755
I'm gonna need your John Handcock here.

129
00:06:42,756 --> 00:06:45,515
Hell's school registration form!

130
00:06:45,516 --> 00:06:47,066
[Rinne Voiceover] Mama, mama,

131
00:06:48,346 --> 00:06:50,079
what the heck happened to me?

132
00:06:52,215 --> 00:06:55,548
Boing, boing, second period has begun.

133
00:06:57,197 --> 00:06:59,984
Please get to your classes.

134
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:04,118
Hello mama, it's me
Rinne, please pick up!

135
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:05,653
How did this happen?

136
00:07:05,654 --> 00:07:07,860
What's going on, mama!

137
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:11,059
You are already dead, Rinne Amagane!

138
00:07:17,216 --> 00:07:20,145
This must be the door I
used when I came here earlier.

139
00:07:20,146 --> 00:07:23,269
So that means it's my way out.

140
00:07:24,317 --> 00:07:26,774
You were open before!

141
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:28,025
I'm going back!

142
00:07:29,252 --> 00:07:30,919
I'm going back home!

143
00:07:34,065 --> 00:07:36,042
[Gatekeepers] Impossible.

144
00:07:36,043 --> 00:07:38,340
We are the gatekeepers.

145
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:42,475
None shall pass through without
the headmaster's permission.

146
00:07:42,476 --> 00:07:46,755
Well are those who enter,
grim for they who leave,

147
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:49,004
yet you are welcome to try.

148
00:07:49,005 --> 00:07:50,628
That you are.

149
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:53,399
[Rinne Voiceover] Wait so
is this place really Hell?

150
00:07:59,968 --> 00:08:02,009
My classmates will know the truth.

151
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:05,419
They'll tell me, 'cause we're friends.

152
00:08:09,074 --> 00:08:12,407
Everyone, there's something I need to.

153
00:08:13,635 --> 00:08:16,232
Gotcha! (laughs)

154
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:17,505
Dammit Kiki.

155
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:19,545
Looks like you owe me lunch, Wolfie.

156
00:08:19,546 --> 00:08:21,105
I can't believe there are still people

157
00:08:21,106 --> 00:08:22,892
dumb enough to fall for that prank.

158
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:23,846
Well you know what they say,

159
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:26,355
not even death cures
stupidity, am I right?

160
00:08:26,356 --> 00:08:27,405
It's worse than dumb.

161
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,975
She's so thick she doesn't even realize

162
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,515
she already up and died.

163
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:31,675
You're kidding me, right?

164
00:08:31,676 --> 00:08:33,915
You guys are still just
pranking me, aren't you?

165
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:34,749
See?

166
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,435
Good lord, get with it.

167
00:08:36,436 --> 00:08:39,219
You're joking, it's impossible.

168
00:08:41,763 --> 00:08:43,453
First comes shock, then denial.

169
00:08:43,454 --> 00:08:45,455
Just accept it.

170
00:08:45,456 --> 00:08:46,785
It's a lie!

171
00:08:46,786 --> 00:08:48,705
How can all of us be dead?

172
00:08:48,706 --> 00:08:50,055
Go die.

173
00:08:50,056 --> 00:08:52,849
So scary. (kisses)

174
00:08:53,716 --> 00:08:56,165
Headmaster Helvis made it pretty clear.

175
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,380
You are dead.

176
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:00,548
(barking)

177
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:06,345
Steela, it must feel like your birthday

178
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,744
now that we're picking on
the new girl instead of you.

179
00:09:08,745 --> 00:09:11,432
Why don't you join in
and sick Franken on her?

180
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:12,905
Huh?

181
00:09:12,906 --> 00:09:14,893
Wait, this dog.

182
00:09:14,894 --> 00:09:18,780
It's moving around but it's a corpse!

183
00:09:18,781 --> 00:09:19,853
There's no way!

184
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,210
There's no way that I'm dead!

185
00:09:25,005 --> 00:09:28,088
(phone keys beeping)

186
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,647
(phone beeping)

187
00:09:33,795 --> 00:09:37,004
[Rinne Voiceover] Maybe
this really is Hell.

188
00:09:37,005 --> 00:09:38,422
But that's crazy.

189
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:41,239
This is all so insane.

190
00:09:42,486 --> 00:09:45,135
Mama, where am I?

191
00:09:45,136 --> 00:09:47,586
And what do I have to do
to get back home to you?

192
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:54,856
(crying)

193
00:09:54,857 --> 00:09:57,107
[Mother Voiceover] Rinne.

194
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:02,605
Please God don't take my daughter.

195
00:10:02,606 --> 00:10:04,419
Not my baby girl.

196
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,219
You're that cat from
before, at the crosswalk.

197
00:10:13,669 --> 00:10:15,525
So you're okay after all.

198
00:10:15,526 --> 00:10:16,669
Thank goodness.

199
00:10:17,705 --> 00:10:19,052
(chuckles)

200
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:20,388
Huh?

201
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:21,389
A cocoon?

202
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:23,513
Is it for me?

203
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:25,985
But what's it for?

204
00:10:29,814 --> 00:10:31,205
Thanks kitty.

205
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:33,479
You know, I appreciate it.

206
00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:37,419
I'm gonna call you Rokku.

207
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,197
(yowling)

208
00:10:46,656 --> 00:10:49,435
See? Nothing to be afraid of.

209
00:10:49,436 --> 00:10:51,179
You're a good boy, aren't you?

210
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,712
They said his name is Franken, right?

211
00:10:58,713 --> 00:11:01,963
(laughs) That tickles!

212
00:11:06,627 --> 00:11:08,745
Man, you really high-tailed it, Rinne.

213
00:11:08,746 --> 00:11:12,195
And good golly, look at that!

214
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:13,605
I didn't think that putrid pooch

215
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,752
could be friends with anybody but Steela.

216
00:11:15,753 --> 00:11:18,436
Rinne, you're a newbie, and
you're not with the program.

217
00:11:18,437 --> 00:11:21,765
So you have to understand you're useless!

218
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:25,876
This dog is useless and
it's owner is even worse!

219
00:11:25,877 --> 00:11:28,276
Keep your head down, do as your told,

220
00:11:28,277 --> 00:11:30,610
and you'll be good as gravy.

221
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:37,265
Ain't that right, Steela?

222
00:11:37,266 --> 00:11:39,092
If you don't want to
get picked on anymore,

223
00:11:39,093 --> 00:11:40,053
then you should.

224
00:11:40,053 --> 00:11:40,886
(gasps)

225
00:11:40,886 --> 00:11:41,886
Barrier!

226
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,634
(gasps)

227
00:11:47,635 --> 00:11:48,635
What the?

228
00:11:52,915 --> 00:11:55,082
(gasping)

229
00:12:00,813 --> 00:12:03,575
[Gatekeepers] The rules and our gate

230
00:12:03,576 --> 00:12:04,983
shall never be broken!

231
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:08,510
- Let's go!
- Right!

232
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:13,996
[Gatekeepers] You're fast, aren't you?

233
00:12:15,327 --> 00:12:16,410
What are you?

234
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:21,825
It looks like her whole body

235
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:23,589
is growing along with her arm.

236
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:30,342
[Gatekeepers] Take this!

237
00:12:30,343 --> 00:12:32,593
(groaning)

238
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,480
No!

239
00:12:48,524 --> 00:12:51,441
Stop it, you're gonna kill someone!

240
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,287
What was that just now?

241
00:13:12,274 --> 00:13:13,274
Hollow?

242
00:13:14,431 --> 00:13:15,796
[Gatekeepers] For the crime of

243
00:13:15,797 --> 00:13:17,475
attempting to break our gate,

244
00:13:17,476 --> 00:13:19,142
you shall be punished.

245
00:13:19,143 --> 00:13:20,149
Stop it!

246
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,705
Steela didn't want to break your gate!

247
00:13:21,706 --> 00:13:24,561
She was just trying to protect her dog!

248
00:13:24,562 --> 00:13:28,062
[Helvis] Class is in session, baby love!

249
00:13:29,122 --> 00:13:31,189
- Hey, that's Helvis.
- (rock and roll music)

250
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,389
Where are you?

251
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,473
I need to speak with you!

252
00:13:35,344 --> 00:13:36,344
Yeah!

253
00:13:37,624 --> 00:13:38,624
Oh yeah!

254
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:45,475
Excuse me headmaster,
please send me back home!

255
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:47,845
I want to go back to my world!

256
00:13:47,846 --> 00:13:50,285
Why? Tell me that!

257
00:13:50,286 --> 00:13:52,215
To see my mama!

258
00:13:52,216 --> 00:13:54,513
Then you got to graduate!

259
00:13:54,514 --> 00:13:57,325
That's the unbreakable rule
for those who have died!

260
00:13:57,326 --> 00:13:58,396
And you died!

261
00:14:00,546 --> 00:14:03,085
This is the law of Destiny Land.

262
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:04,635
No other golden ticket is gonna

263
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:07,102
get you through this gateway to Heaven.

264
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,475
Policy at Sanzu River Academy
is to leave punishment

265
00:14:10,476 --> 00:14:13,384
of all rule breakers
to the student council.

266
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:16,089
And always remember, rock and roll!

267
00:14:19,856 --> 00:14:21,689
Study up, bu-bu-bu-bu-baby!

268
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:26,193
(whimpering)

269
00:14:26,194 --> 00:14:28,315
Study up, baby?

270
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:31,565
So I have to graduate from the school?

271
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:33,389
But how do I graduate?

272
00:14:34,985 --> 00:14:35,985
Baby?

273
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,817
(bells ringing)

274
00:14:42,858 --> 00:14:47,858
Oh Rin-rin, how about
we walk home together?

275
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,896
'Kay?

276
00:14:48,897 --> 00:14:50,909
Wait, hang on, we have homes here?

277
00:14:53,366 --> 00:14:56,705
Whoa, I had no idea there
would be this many people!

278
00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:58,205
They're all students?

279
00:14:58,206 --> 00:14:59,605
[Wolfie] Yeah, no duh.

280
00:14:59,606 --> 00:15:01,675
Seriously, get with the program.

281
00:15:01,676 --> 00:15:04,945
This whole place is
actually Sanzu River Academy.

282
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,065
It is?

283
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:08,785
Yo, you're acting real
strange today, Kiki.

284
00:15:08,786 --> 00:15:11,996
Hey, back off Wolfie,
I've got my reasons okay?

285
00:15:15,944 --> 00:15:18,194
(whimpers)

286
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,629
100 friends starts with one, right?

287
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,625
(laughs nervously)

288
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:27,059
Those girls are
definitely hiding something.

289
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,225
[Rinne] It's huge!

290
00:15:31,226 --> 00:15:32,059
See you tomorrow!

291
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,499
Hey, aren't you supposed
to head home too Steela?

292
00:15:37,016 --> 00:15:38,545
Oh.

293
00:15:38,546 --> 00:15:41,339
So we're roommates, how about that.

294
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,699
[Rinne Voiceover] Mama, mama.

295
00:15:50,096 --> 00:15:52,269
Today was a really long day.

296
00:15:57,686 --> 00:16:00,133
(crying)

297
00:16:00,134 --> 00:16:00,967
Shut up!

298
00:16:00,968 --> 00:16:02,550
Who's doing that?

299
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,295
[Rinne Voiceover] If this is a dream,

300
00:16:14,296 --> 00:16:16,485
please let me wake up.

301
00:16:16,486 --> 00:16:20,236
(forlorn instrumental music)

302
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,876
(energetic instrumental music)

303
00:16:32,877 --> 00:16:34,408
So friggin' late!

304
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:35,426
Morning!

305
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,355
(laughs) Good morning Rin-rin.

306
00:16:37,356 --> 00:16:40,735
No more pranks or teasing
'cause we're friends, right?

307
00:16:40,736 --> 00:16:41,736
[Girls] Stare.

308
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:45,285
Why is everyone staring at me?

309
00:16:45,286 --> 00:16:47,579
I know I put my skirt on this morning.

310
00:16:48,694 --> 00:16:52,370
(bright instrumental music)

311
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:53,371
Huh?

312
00:17:01,244 --> 00:17:02,565
(bells)

313
00:17:02,566 --> 00:17:03,416
Attention,

314
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:06,048
the student council has
an important announcement.

315
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:07,296
Rinne Amagane,

316
00:17:07,297 --> 00:17:09,505
please report directly to
our office after school.

317
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:10,745
But why me?

318
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:11,865
What?

319
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:13,185
Rinne?

320
00:17:13,186 --> 00:17:14,649
Disgusting swine!

321
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,459
You dare to steal my darling Kutou?

322
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,320
[Rinne Voiceover] Kutou, Ryu Kutou?

323
00:17:22,058 --> 00:17:24,743
But where have I heard that name before?

324
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,875
Think think think.

325
00:17:26,876 --> 00:17:29,605
[Ryu] What's a young lady
like yourself doing over here?

326
00:17:29,606 --> 00:17:32,275
Oh so that guy is the
student council president.

327
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:33,276
I guess.

328
00:17:36,749 --> 00:17:39,832
(students bickering)

329
00:17:43,418 --> 00:17:44,712
Shut up!

330
00:17:44,713 --> 00:17:47,499
Day after day, can't you just shut up.

331
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,268
Gotcha!

332
00:17:54,596 --> 00:17:55,599
Hm?

333
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,103
(chuckles) Don't die, now.

334
00:17:58,104 --> 00:18:00,879
(laughing hysterically)

335
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,995
I bet it's about yesterday.

336
00:18:02,996 --> 00:18:05,663
(bells ringing)

337
00:18:08,036 --> 00:18:09,135
No!

338
00:18:09,136 --> 00:18:11,415
[Rinne Voiceover] Come
on Rinne, get it together.

339
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,946
Can't be late, not for this!

340
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,635
Sorry about that Rinne.

341
00:18:32,636 --> 00:18:34,395
My long legs must have gotten in the way.

342
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:35,675
You know how it is.

343
00:18:35,676 --> 00:18:37,559
Serves you right.

344
00:18:39,566 --> 00:18:41,317
If it isn't Miss Amagane.

345
00:18:41,318 --> 00:18:43,485
(gasping)

346
00:18:45,036 --> 00:18:47,786
(groans angrily)

347
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,495
[Rinne Voiceover] mama,
it's me, your Rinne.

348
00:18:53,496 --> 00:18:55,035
Mama, mama!

349
00:18:55,036 --> 00:18:56,545
No don't go mama!

350
00:18:56,546 --> 00:18:58,989
Hold on, please don't leave me!

351
00:18:58,990 --> 00:18:59,823
No!

352
00:18:59,823 --> 00:19:00,762
Oh goodness.

353
00:19:00,763 --> 00:19:03,105
She isn't doing too well.

354
00:19:03,106 --> 00:19:04,425
[Luca] No surprise.

355
00:19:04,426 --> 00:19:06,275
All dreams in Hell are nightmares.

356
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:09,597
That's not it, look,
her nose is bleeding.

357
00:19:09,598 --> 00:19:12,165
[Ryu] And that's exactly
why I called her here.

358
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,441
Hold on, did you know about this, Kutou?

359
00:19:14,442 --> 00:19:17,415
Miss Amagane, I must apologize.

360
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,255
No, it's my fault, but, it's just that,

361
00:19:20,256 --> 00:19:21,739
uh, where am I?

362
00:19:22,856 --> 00:19:24,521
[Ryu] Do you recall where it was

363
00:19:24,522 --> 00:19:26,115
that you were heading earlier?

364
00:19:26,116 --> 00:19:27,695
Earlier during class I was told

365
00:19:27,696 --> 00:19:29,905
to come to the student council office.

366
00:19:29,906 --> 00:19:31,325
Oh!

367
00:19:31,326 --> 00:19:32,605
[Ryu] Exactly.

368
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:34,675
You're currently in Sanzu River Academy's

369
00:19:34,676 --> 00:19:36,477
student council office.

370
00:19:36,478 --> 00:19:38,785
Wait, so that means you're all?

371
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:41,875
Oh right, we've yet to
introduce ourselves, haven't we?

372
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:43,375
I am Rei Kakurazaka,

373
00:19:43,376 --> 00:19:45,445
the vice president of the student council

374
00:19:45,446 --> 00:19:47,095
of Sanzu River Academy.

375
00:19:47,096 --> 00:19:49,665
The name's Mario, it's
nice to meet you Rinne.

376
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,435
Pleased to meet you as well, I'm Luca.

377
00:19:51,436 --> 00:19:53,399
I'm both the treasurer and secretary.

378
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:55,455
Then there's me.

379
00:19:55,456 --> 00:19:58,029
I am Ryu Kutou, student council president.

380
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,041
Regarding Rinne Amagane,

381
00:20:00,042 --> 00:20:01,805
the student council would like to

382
00:20:01,806 --> 00:20:03,306
inform you of your punishment.

383
00:20:12,326 --> 00:20:14,441
(grumbles)

384
00:20:14,442 --> 00:20:16,085
What do you mean there's no punishment?

385
00:20:16,086 --> 00:20:18,335
President Kutou, why wouldn't there be?

386
00:20:18,336 --> 00:20:21,065
Because there's no reason
to punish a bystander.

387
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:23,555
Steela was the one who tried
to destroy the school gate,

388
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,155
so simply put, she should
be punished accordingly.

389
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:28,475
But you're wrong, that was
completely unintentional!

390
00:20:28,476 --> 00:20:30,425
She was just trying to
protect her dog Franken

391
00:20:30,426 --> 00:20:33,425
when everything got out of hand!

392
00:20:33,426 --> 00:20:37,119
Wait, then why am I here?

393
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:41,045
That's the real question at hand.

394
00:20:41,046 --> 00:20:42,845
We couldn't find a single record of you

395
00:20:42,846 --> 00:20:45,046
having died in a traffic accident.

396
00:20:45,047 --> 00:20:48,495
In fact, there's no record of you at all.

397
00:20:48,496 --> 00:20:49,775
[Rinne Voiceover] What is he?

398
00:20:49,776 --> 00:20:52,695
[Ryu] To be honest, you
being here is a mistake.

399
00:20:52,696 --> 00:20:53,735
[Rinne Voiceover] A mistake?

400
00:20:53,736 --> 00:20:55,165
[Ryu] I understand if you're shocked,

401
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,165
but please hear me out.

402
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,205
Your nosebleed is all the proof we need.

403
00:20:59,206 --> 00:21:00,566
[Rinne Voiceover] Proof of what?

404
00:21:02,316 --> 00:21:04,609
Not a single soul in Hell has blood.

405
00:21:05,816 --> 00:21:07,145
The further I investigate,

406
00:21:07,146 --> 00:21:09,365
the more dubious your case appears to me.

407
00:21:09,366 --> 00:21:11,895
Trust me when I say I
have reason to believe

408
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:15,262
that someone may have brought
you to Hell intentionally.

409
00:21:15,263 --> 00:21:18,666
We're running out of time, Miss Amagane.

410
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:22,775
[Rinne Voiceover] No way.

411
00:21:22,776 --> 00:21:25,345
[Mario] And there she goes.

412
00:21:25,346 --> 00:21:28,495
Can't blame her Kutou, you
kinda dropped a bomb on her.

413
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,845
But she'll come around.

414
00:21:29,846 --> 00:21:30,925
[Rei] Certainly.

415
00:21:30,926 --> 00:21:31,961
I believe more than anyone

416
00:21:31,962 --> 00:21:34,355
she'll understand what we're doing.

417
00:21:34,356 --> 00:21:36,575
[Luca] All we can do is
just trust her and wait.

418
00:21:36,576 --> 00:21:38,979
As they say, only God knows now.

419
00:21:40,606 --> 00:21:42,735
[Ryu Voiceover] This is Hell, Luca.

420
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:44,681
There is no God.

421
00:21:44,682 --> 00:21:45,859
Not here.

422
00:21:50,065 --> 00:21:54,144
(forlorn instrumental music)

423
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:56,235
[Rinne Voiceover] I'm
in way over my head.

424
00:21:56,236 --> 00:21:58,606
I don't understand
what's going on anymore.

425
00:22:09,639 --> 00:22:14,639
Huh?

426
00:22:16,122 --> 00:22:17,983
(upbeat instrumental music)

427
00:22:17,984 --> 00:22:19,137
I'm back!

428
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:22,497
If you have spirit, anything is possible!

429
00:22:22,498 --> 00:22:25,665
(students chattering)

430
00:22:28,603 --> 00:22:30,353
Spirit is everything!

431
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:32,916
Bon appetite!

432
00:22:35,608 --> 00:22:38,608
(steady rock music)

433
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:44,785
Stay the hell away from my
darling Kutou, you hear me?

434
00:22:44,786 --> 00:22:48,359
Skip her stupid face and
deck her straight in the gut!

435
00:22:52,934 --> 00:22:56,017
(shouting in dismay)

436
00:22:59,706 --> 00:23:01,845
Seriously, how old are you?

437
00:23:01,846 --> 00:23:05,203
No guy would fall for a
girl into this garbage.

438
00:23:05,204 --> 00:23:08,053
Give it back right now, give it back!

439
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,137
Give it back!

440
00:23:12,568 --> 00:23:16,385
Phantoma, Kuronora,
isn't that a little much?

441
00:23:16,386 --> 00:23:17,795
Mind your own business.

442
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:20,795
Teasing Rinne will only
invite certain doom or worse.

443
00:23:20,796 --> 00:23:22,921
You're inviting an ass-whooping!

444
00:23:22,922 --> 00:23:23,922
But.

445
00:23:24,608 --> 00:23:27,241
(gasps)

446
00:23:27,242 --> 00:23:29,833
[Kuronora And Phantoma] Get lost Kiki!

447
00:23:29,834 --> 00:23:31,183
(growling)

448
00:23:31,184 --> 00:23:32,623
Crap, it's the Dorm Mother!

449
00:23:32,624 --> 00:23:34,063
Scramble!

450
00:23:34,064 --> 00:23:37,652
Lunch time is be enjoyed in the quiet.

451
00:23:37,653 --> 00:23:39,986
As punishment, you will die!

452
00:23:44,726 --> 00:23:47,076
[Rinne Voiceover] I
absolutely won't give up.

453
00:23:48,146 --> 00:23:49,146
Never.

454
00:23:50,856 --> 00:23:51,949
Right mama?

455
00:23:53,256 --> 00:23:54,369
Oh hey there Rokku.

456
00:23:55,276 --> 00:23:56,176
How about you?

457
00:23:56,177 --> 00:23:59,672
Do you have any idea what's going on?

458
00:23:59,673 --> 00:24:02,792
I guess not, since you're just a cat.

459
00:24:02,793 --> 00:24:06,152
Looks like I'll have to
figure things out for myself.

460
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,486
(explosion)

461
00:24:12,393 --> 00:24:14,393
(roars)

462
00:24:21,782 --> 00:24:24,392
(screaming)

463
00:24:24,393 --> 00:24:25,393
Oh my God!

464
00:24:29,316 --> 00:24:31,784
If you just believe in yourself,

465
00:24:31,785 --> 00:24:33,796
anything is possible!

466
00:24:33,797 --> 00:24:35,534
You dumb broad!

467
00:24:35,535 --> 00:24:37,535
That's not how it works!

468
00:24:39,421 --> 00:24:41,649
Kutou, grab the girl!

469
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:46,708
Be careful!

470
00:24:47,913 --> 00:24:49,330
Seismic Charge!

471
00:24:55,157 --> 00:24:57,490
(screaming)

472
00:25:08,326 --> 00:25:10,445
Mario, where's Helvis?

473
00:25:10,446 --> 00:25:12,625
Sorry, he got away from me.

474
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:14,280
It's fine.

475
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:16,859
Easy now, mind your injuries.

476
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:20,482
Blood?

477
00:25:20,483 --> 00:25:22,809
All of you, you're bleeding!

478
00:25:23,835 --> 00:25:26,205
Perhaps you understand.

479
00:25:26,206 --> 00:25:28,964
The real Helvis is truly a monster.

480
00:25:28,965 --> 00:25:31,215
That man, that demon,

481
00:25:31,216 --> 00:25:33,755
is the first murderer in human history.

482
00:25:33,756 --> 00:25:35,169
And he brought you here.

483
00:25:36,246 --> 00:25:38,159
However you're still alive.

484
00:25:39,016 --> 00:25:41,165
Trapped in Hell, just like us.

485
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:44,545
I know it's a shock, and I
should have explained earlier,

486
00:25:44,546 --> 00:25:48,209
but, none of us can return home
unless we can defeat Helvis.

487
00:25:49,862 --> 00:25:51,479
But what hope do we have?

488
00:25:52,866 --> 00:25:55,892
It's impossible, totally insane!

489
00:25:55,893 --> 00:25:59,759
That insanity is our only
way out of here, trust me.

490
00:26:02,126 --> 00:26:04,759
[Rinne Voiceover] We
have to beat that monster?

491
00:26:05,826 --> 00:26:07,176
But that's, how can I.

492
00:26:10,926 --> 00:26:12,039
Am I ever on time?

493
00:26:14,521 --> 00:26:17,083
Headmaster Helvis destroyed
the entire school.

494
00:26:18,355 --> 00:26:20,280
So why am I even running?

495
00:26:20,281 --> 00:26:22,183
Are there even classes to be late for?

496
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:26,217
What in the?

497
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:28,785
No, please stop!

498
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:31,560
Somebody help me, please!

499
00:26:31,561 --> 00:26:32,728
What in the?

500
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:40,231
Helvis!

501
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:43,080
What's going on?

502
00:26:43,081 --> 00:26:45,081
(snaps)

503
00:26:46,441 --> 00:26:48,319
- There she goes.
- That's awful.

504
00:26:54,555 --> 00:26:56,888
[Angel] Master Helvis sir.

505
00:26:58,146 --> 00:26:59,715
Landed on volleyball?

506
00:26:59,716 --> 00:27:01,185
That's pretty lame.

507
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:04,365
The event for the
yearly Sanzu River Academy

508
00:27:04,366 --> 00:27:06,935
sports day has been decided.

509
00:27:06,936 --> 00:27:08,309
It's volleyball baby!

510
00:27:10,266 --> 00:27:11,775
Members of the winning team will have

511
00:27:11,776 --> 00:27:15,559
any wish of theirs
granted, one per student.

512
00:27:17,056 --> 00:27:18,383
Make a wish, baby!

513
00:27:19,635 --> 00:27:21,218
Fight for it, baby!

514
00:27:23,657 --> 00:27:26,772
[Students] What a surprise!

515
00:27:26,773 --> 00:27:28,213
Did he just bring back the school?

516
00:27:29,177 --> 00:27:30,355
Holy balls!

517
00:27:30,356 --> 00:27:32,625
[Ryu] Will you truly
grant anyone's wish,

518
00:27:32,626 --> 00:27:34,003
Headmaster Helvis?

519
00:27:36,045 --> 00:27:38,329
President Kutou.

520
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:42,165
[Helvis] You have my word,
student council president.

521
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:44,869
I'm curious what your heart longs for.

522
00:27:55,226 --> 00:27:57,335
She's quite a catch.

523
00:27:57,336 --> 00:27:58,489
- Oh my.
- Exemplary.

524
00:28:06,577 --> 00:28:09,835
[Helvis Voiceover] Damn that Kutou.

525
00:28:09,836 --> 00:28:11,455
[Ryu] Accursed demon.

526
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,349
- Hold on.
- Mario?

527
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:16,993
- Kutou?
- You say somethin'?

528
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,937
President Kutou?

529
00:28:19,938 --> 00:28:21,938
(gasps)

530
00:28:22,866 --> 00:28:24,257
Oh hey Mario!

531
00:28:24,258 --> 00:28:26,509
Where'd Helvis go, that devil?

532
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:28,997
Huh?

533
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:32,015
Why are we so high up, are
we on top of the building?

534
00:28:32,016 --> 00:28:34,965
That's right, now
settle down and listen.

535
00:28:34,966 --> 00:28:38,465
Take a look over there, that's
called the Heartbreak Hotel.

536
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,745
It's where Helvis calls home.

537
00:28:40,746 --> 00:28:42,589
Who in the actual Hell is he?

538
00:28:43,443 --> 00:28:46,279
Helvis is the first
human to commit murder.

539
00:28:47,196 --> 00:28:49,545
Kutou mentioned something
like that yesterday, yeah?

540
00:28:49,546 --> 00:28:51,055
Yeah.

541
00:28:51,056 --> 00:28:53,055
In one of man's oldest stories,

542
00:28:53,056 --> 00:28:55,085
it tells of the stories Cain and Abel,

543
00:28:55,086 --> 00:28:58,373
where Cain slaughters his younger
brother in a jealous rage.

544
00:28:58,374 --> 00:29:01,355
It's known as the first murder in history.

545
00:29:01,356 --> 00:29:03,939
Helvis is the Cain from that story.

546
00:29:05,556 --> 00:29:07,825
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

547
00:29:07,826 --> 00:29:09,902
But every word is true.

548
00:29:09,903 --> 00:29:12,485
Helvis created this hell
called Destiny Land,

549
00:29:12,486 --> 00:29:15,155
and with it came Sanzu River Academy,

550
00:29:15,156 --> 00:29:17,665
all just to take in the dead of the world.

551
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:20,545
But get this, even though
everyone else is dead,

552
00:29:20,546 --> 00:29:23,285
the living like us can still end up here.

553
00:29:23,286 --> 00:29:26,645
The question is how did
he bring us to this place?

554
00:29:26,646 --> 00:29:29,095
We, the living, who are
still flesh and blood.

555
00:29:29,096 --> 00:29:31,255
We're clearly different
from the other students.

556
00:29:31,256 --> 00:29:34,515
After all, we still
look like normal humans.

557
00:29:34,516 --> 00:29:38,755
Mario, I believe you and all, it's just,

558
00:29:38,756 --> 00:29:41,555
I guess I don't get why
you're trusting me with this.

559
00:29:41,556 --> 00:29:43,785
I'm a normal girl with no special powers.

560
00:29:43,786 --> 00:29:45,825
There's no way I can beat Helvis.

561
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:46,945
'Cause this.

562
00:29:46,946 --> 00:29:49,825
The fact that we bleed means
that we're both still alive.

563
00:29:49,826 --> 00:29:50,796
[Rinne] So?

564
00:29:50,797 --> 00:29:52,815
Then that's the all the
reason we need, don't you think?

565
00:29:52,816 --> 00:29:54,699
Which makes us friends, right?

566
00:29:55,539 --> 00:29:57,225
We sure are!

567
00:29:57,226 --> 00:29:58,475
[Mario] Anyway right now we've got to

568
00:29:58,476 --> 00:30:00,225
focus on winning that tournament.

569
00:30:00,226 --> 00:30:01,405
Let's give it all we got.

570
00:30:01,406 --> 00:30:02,557
[Rinne] I'll try!

571
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:05,215
So then, you some
kind of volleyball pro,

572
00:30:05,216 --> 00:30:06,789
or do I got to go easy on ya?

573
00:30:07,896 --> 00:30:09,046
[Rinne] Wait and see!

574
00:30:11,346 --> 00:30:15,415
Dammit Kutou, that girl
is totally wasted on you.

575
00:30:15,416 --> 00:30:16,416
Too bad.

576
00:30:17,846 --> 00:30:18,679
[Phantoma] Huh?

577
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,245
If we all work together and
win the volleyball tournament,

578
00:30:21,246 --> 00:30:23,175
each of us gets a single wish granted.

579
00:30:23,176 --> 00:30:24,795
- A pair of girl's panties?
- Share your energy with me!

580
00:30:24,796 --> 00:30:27,385
Volleyballs don't summon dragons?

581
00:30:27,386 --> 00:30:28,219
Huh?

582
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,709
Then what's your wish, Rinne?

583
00:30:31,236 --> 00:30:33,995
I just want to go back
home to see my mama.

584
00:30:33,996 --> 00:30:35,405
That's all I really want.

585
00:30:35,406 --> 00:30:37,045
So you're just using us, huh?

586
00:30:37,046 --> 00:30:38,737
I'm thinking I should slug you again.

587
00:30:38,738 --> 00:30:39,972
Phantoma just listen to me.

588
00:30:39,973 --> 00:30:42,945
Now now, keep your
eyes on the prize girls.

589
00:30:42,946 --> 00:30:45,775
I'm sure if we work as a
team we can win no problem-o.

590
00:30:45,776 --> 00:30:48,215
What, work together?

591
00:30:48,216 --> 00:30:51,429
Exactly, as a volleyball team.

592
00:30:53,106 --> 00:30:54,395
Now let's get the ball rolling

593
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:57,085
on Sanzu River Academy's
volleyball tournament!

594
00:30:57,086 --> 00:30:58,875
The great Headmaster
Helvis has stated that

595
00:30:58,876 --> 00:31:01,537
he will generously grant the
wishes of the winning team!

596
00:31:01,538 --> 00:31:03,653
So everyone go balls to the wall!

597
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:05,093
East Witches are number one!

598
00:31:05,094 --> 00:31:06,385
[Girls] Number one!

599
00:31:06,386 --> 00:31:07,629
[East Witch Leader] We are champions!

600
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,887
[Girls] Champions!

601
00:31:08,888 --> 00:31:10,567
[East Witch Leader]
Volleyball is the best!

602
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:11,985
[Girls] Go big!

603
00:31:14,016 --> 00:31:17,905
Now bow down and worship
the great East Witches!

604
00:31:17,906 --> 00:31:18,985
Bitch is huge.

605
00:31:18,986 --> 00:31:19,976
I drink my milk.

606
00:31:19,977 --> 00:31:21,195
Also your tears.

607
00:31:21,196 --> 00:31:22,205
I can't believe a bunch of

608
00:31:22,206 --> 00:31:25,195
no talent lifes like
you are challenging us.

609
00:31:25,196 --> 00:31:26,196
Moron.

610
00:31:27,326 --> 00:31:28,797
Eat floor you bitch.

611
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:30,005
[Rinne] Phantoma!

612
00:31:30,006 --> 00:31:31,145
Don't get it twisted.

613
00:31:31,146 --> 00:31:33,415
I'd never play volleyball, dead or alive.

614
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:35,435
We're all just here to watch you fail

615
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:37,873
and your silly little
wish crumble to dust.

616
00:31:37,874 --> 00:31:38,707
(giggles)

617
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:41,965
You Gutter Rats can't
just kick me around!

618
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:44,885
I'll show you the rage
of an Olympic athlete!

619
00:31:44,886 --> 00:31:47,095
You know, Phantoma, if we win,

620
00:31:47,096 --> 00:31:50,375
you can always wish for a
date with your beloved Kutou.

621
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:51,905
- A date?
- I'll give you a date.

622
00:31:51,906 --> 00:31:53,753
- A date with death!
- That's right, just imagine!

623
00:31:53,754 --> 00:31:55,012
(laughing)

624
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:57,430
Catch me darling, catch me!

625
00:32:00,034 --> 00:32:01,034
Right!

626
00:32:01,937 --> 00:32:05,732
We're gonna destroy you
all, and I'll get my date!

627
00:32:05,733 --> 00:32:06,733
Play ball!

628
00:32:10,669 --> 00:32:13,669
(breathing heavily)

629
00:32:18,183 --> 00:32:20,945
Didn't think you'd last
this long, Gutter Rats.

630
00:32:20,946 --> 00:32:23,405
But you can rest easy
knowing your worthless dreams

631
00:32:23,406 --> 00:32:26,755
were dashed by no less
than the best of the best!

632
00:32:26,756 --> 00:32:28,815
Now, die!

633
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:29,816
My date!

634
00:32:35,591 --> 00:32:37,841
(shouting)

635
00:32:40,015 --> 00:32:42,935
Steela, what the hell man?

636
00:32:42,936 --> 00:32:46,089
Phantoma, the next one's
coming, so don't sweat it!

637
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:50,856
Oh, you'll sweat, you'll sweat blood!

638
00:32:55,192 --> 00:32:57,442
(shouting)

639
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:04,265
My precious date with
Kutou is on the line here!

640
00:33:04,266 --> 00:33:05,905
Would you quit screwing around?

641
00:33:05,906 --> 00:33:08,555
Come on guys, we totally got this!

642
00:33:08,556 --> 00:33:11,275
If we believe then we can achieve!

643
00:33:11,276 --> 00:33:12,859
Uh, sure.

644
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,928
Believe?

645
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:14,762
Yeah right.

646
00:33:14,763 --> 00:33:16,709
Just cut the bull crap!

647
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,513
(screaming)

648
00:33:21,946 --> 00:33:22,779
Hey, ref,

649
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,778
isn't electrocution against
the rules or something?

650
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:26,865
There's nothing against
it in the rulebook,

651
00:33:26,866 --> 00:33:27,871
so it's far game.

652
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:29,323
For real?

653
00:33:29,324 --> 00:33:30,824
You're finished!

654
00:33:36,572 --> 00:33:38,011
[Rinne Voiceover] Mama.

655
00:33:38,012 --> 00:33:43,012
Mama, mama, please mama,
please, give me strength.

656
00:33:46,686 --> 00:33:48,955
Just give it up already Gutter Rats,

657
00:33:48,956 --> 00:33:50,799
you're clearly out of your league.

658
00:33:52,722 --> 00:33:54,019
Yeah right.

659
00:33:59,132 --> 00:34:01,756
I will never give up!

660
00:34:04,686 --> 00:34:07,359
It's not over yet!

661
00:34:12,332 --> 00:34:14,582
(shouting)

662
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,927
I won't give up, even if it kills me!

663
00:34:20,928 --> 00:34:24,689
Then how about you just die already?

664
00:34:27,956 --> 00:34:29,085
[Kuronora] The ball!

665
00:34:29,086 --> 00:34:30,536
Damn, it's going to Steela.

666
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:39,626
It's all over.

667
00:34:40,338 --> 00:34:42,166
Yes, we win!

668
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:43,217
Volleyball is the best!

669
00:34:43,218 --> 00:34:44,807
[Girls] East Witches are the best!

670
00:34:44,808 --> 00:34:47,141
East Witches are champion!

671
00:34:48,535 --> 00:34:49,535
Huh?

672
00:34:51,754 --> 00:34:52,928
Steela?

673
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:55,205
She was just trying to help Rinne.

674
00:34:55,206 --> 00:34:57,423
But when she lifted her arms,

675
00:34:57,424 --> 00:34:59,433
the ball just happened to bounce off

676
00:34:59,434 --> 00:35:02,465
and land on the other side of the court.

677
00:35:02,466 --> 00:35:03,493
Thanks Steela.

678
00:35:14,782 --> 00:35:16,565
[Referee] What an upset!

679
00:35:16,566 --> 00:35:18,225
(Helvis chuckles)

680
00:35:18,226 --> 00:35:20,035
The Gutter Rats have
crushed their opponents,

681
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:22,955
so let's keep the ball
rolling with round two!

682
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:25,905
I'm finally gonna have some
one on one time with Kutou!

683
00:35:25,906 --> 00:35:28,425
Seems like Phantoma has lost her edge.

684
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:30,745
People are falling under Rinne's spell.

685
00:35:30,746 --> 00:35:32,755
Where'd that punk go anyway?

686
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:35,155
President Kutou's match is
gonna start any minute now!

687
00:35:35,156 --> 00:35:36,669
We've got to hurry up!

688
00:35:39,315 --> 00:35:41,721
Oh, Kiki look it's a bunch of pandas!

689
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:42,676
Knock it off!

690
00:35:42,677 --> 00:35:44,665
We're not pandas, we're Pandaz!

691
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:46,275
The volleyball champs, get it?

692
00:35:46,276 --> 00:35:47,805
Like with a Z?

693
00:35:47,806 --> 00:35:49,325
Are these bears bothering you?

694
00:35:49,326 --> 00:35:50,575
President Kutou!

695
00:35:50,576 --> 00:35:52,375
Cut that shit out bamboo muncher.

696
00:35:52,376 --> 00:35:53,525
We're your opponents.

697
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,042
So put your balls where your mouths are,

698
00:35:55,043 --> 00:35:56,615
and get on the court.

699
00:35:56,616 --> 00:35:57,566
Get bent!

700
00:35:57,567 --> 00:35:59,992
The student council Four
Heavenly Kings are a joke!

701
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:02,155
Who are you calling
bamboo, oh that's me.

702
00:36:02,156 --> 00:36:04,239
Well you'll be munching on defeat!

703
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:08,112
[Pandaz] We're so sorry!

704
00:36:08,113 --> 00:36:10,415
But, they're endangered.

705
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:12,455
Let's meet in the finals, Miss Amagane.

706
00:36:12,456 --> 00:36:15,449
Dammit dude could you for
once just give a guy a chance?

707
00:36:17,116 --> 00:36:20,525
[Helvis] Humans of all
kinds are creatures of desire.

708
00:36:20,526 --> 00:36:21,825
They cannot exist from moment

709
00:36:21,826 --> 00:36:24,007
to moment without reaching for more.

710
00:36:24,008 --> 00:36:26,245
But how does that reach stack up?

711
00:36:26,246 --> 00:36:31,105
What meaning does it have
in this hellish academy?

712
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:33,625
[Referee] Goodness
gracious great balls of fire!

713
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:36,375
The Gutter Rats have vaulted
straight to the finals!

714
00:36:36,376 --> 00:36:39,386
Now they face off against
the student council!

715
00:36:49,996 --> 00:36:51,095
No surprise there.

716
00:36:51,096 --> 00:36:53,225
These girls didn't get here
through mere coincidence,

717
00:36:53,226 --> 00:36:54,063
did they?

718
00:36:54,064 --> 00:36:56,167
And they're just as serious
about this as we are.

719
00:36:56,168 --> 00:36:57,001
(chuckles)

720
00:36:57,002 --> 00:36:59,572
[Referee] And now we come
to the crucial match point.

721
00:36:59,573 --> 00:37:00,692
Both the Four Heavenly Kings and

722
00:37:00,693 --> 00:37:02,425
the Gutter Rats are at their limits.

723
00:37:02,426 --> 00:37:04,869
So who's gonna drop the ball first?

724
00:37:10,343 --> 00:37:13,169
The thoroughly wounded
Rinne Amagane will serve.

725
00:37:14,996 --> 00:37:16,485
[Mario Voiceover]
You gonna do it, Rinne?

726
00:37:16,486 --> 00:37:18,345
Yeah, I can see it coming.

727
00:37:18,346 --> 00:37:20,095
I'm ready for it.

728
00:37:20,096 --> 00:37:25,061
Well then, bring it on!
(Rinne shouting)

729
00:37:25,062 --> 00:37:26,895
What the hell is this?

730
00:37:31,238 --> 00:37:34,275
Damn, I sent it flying.

731
00:37:34,276 --> 00:37:35,639
Hey, my bad.

732
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:41,020
(chuckles)

733
00:37:45,547 --> 00:37:47,797
(cheering)

734
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:53,947
[Referee] The Gutter Rats
win the whole ball of wax!

735
00:37:53,948 --> 00:37:56,198
(cheering)

736
00:37:57,788 --> 00:38:00,605
Ya did damn good, baby.

737
00:38:00,606 --> 00:38:03,085
You gave us your
word, Headmaster Helvis.

738
00:38:03,086 --> 00:38:05,775
Now grant our wishes like you promised!

739
00:38:05,776 --> 00:38:07,089
Do it now!

740
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:10,145
As a man of my word, you'll
each get what you desire.

741
00:38:10,146 --> 00:38:12,726
Now speak your wishes, bu-bu-baby!

742
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:17,095
[Rinne Voiceover] I
only have one single wish.

743
00:38:17,096 --> 00:38:19,193
It's all I want.

744
00:38:19,194 --> 00:38:20,694
Bu-bu-bu-bu-bam!

745
00:38:29,468 --> 00:38:31,508
Wait, am I still here and
not back home with mama?

746
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:34,645
If'n you're so insistent,

747
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,925
I can always see to your mother's demise

748
00:38:36,926 --> 00:38:37,826
and bring her down here.

749
00:38:37,827 --> 00:38:39,699
Would that give you satisfaction?

750
00:38:41,526 --> 00:38:43,165
You only pass through life once,

751
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:45,449
you don't come back for an encore!

752
00:38:47,098 --> 00:38:50,035
Back me up on this,
Kiki, I just wanna go home!

753
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,459
That's not crazy, right?

754
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:54,525
Sorry Rinne but we're
not on the same page.

755
00:38:54,526 --> 00:38:55,778
Nobody thinks you're crazy for

756
00:38:55,779 --> 00:38:57,465
wanting to see your mom again,

757
00:38:57,466 --> 00:38:58,945
but there's a limit to these things.

758
00:38:58,946 --> 00:39:01,422
Once you die, it's over.

759
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:02,955
But you said.

760
00:39:02,956 --> 00:39:05,415
Hey, look at Steela,
she didn't get her wish,

761
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:06,909
but she's not whinin'.

762
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,305
(heartbeat)

763
00:39:08,306 --> 00:39:10,525
Steela, is something wrong?

764
00:39:10,526 --> 00:39:12,079
What's up? Hey?

765
00:39:14,306 --> 00:39:16,005
(heartbeat)

766
00:39:16,006 --> 00:39:19,437
Nothing's wrong, because I am nothing.

767
00:39:19,438 --> 00:39:21,521
She, Steela just spoke?

768
00:39:24,478 --> 00:39:28,406
[Rinne Voiceover] Steela,
volleyball, mama, limits?

769
00:39:33,056 --> 00:39:35,135
You gave Miss Amagane your word.

770
00:39:35,136 --> 00:39:36,046
Now keep it.

771
00:39:36,047 --> 00:39:40,005
A wish like that is no
wish at all, sore loser!

772
00:39:40,006 --> 00:39:41,255
You tyrant.

773
00:39:41,256 --> 00:39:43,455
Even the mighty
student council president

774
00:39:43,456 --> 00:39:45,259
doesn't always get his way.

775
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:47,912
We'll see about that.

776
00:39:47,913 --> 00:39:49,345
I'm not giving up.

777
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:51,427
Not while this girl is here.

778
00:39:51,428 --> 00:39:53,511
(crying)

779
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:09,288
(chuckles)

780
00:40:17,036 --> 00:40:19,527
Why has it started beating?

781
00:40:19,528 --> 00:40:20,528
Why now?

782
00:40:29,943 --> 00:40:30,955
[Rinne Voiceover] If the rules

783
00:40:30,956 --> 00:40:33,105
set by others don't actually apply,

784
00:40:33,106 --> 00:40:36,075
then I'll find a way back
to my world on my own.

785
00:40:36,076 --> 00:40:39,435
I will return home, I promise.

786
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:41,039
For your sake, mama.

787
00:40:42,586 --> 00:40:43,586
I'm on my way!

788
00:40:51,792 --> 00:40:54,475
Am I going the right way?

789
00:40:54,476 --> 00:40:55,789
Is there a right way?

790
00:40:59,636 --> 00:41:02,247
(distant rumblings)

791
00:41:02,248 --> 00:41:03,248
Whoa!

792
00:41:04,132 --> 00:41:05,132
It's huge!

793
00:41:07,392 --> 00:41:10,005
Is that a stone?

794
00:41:10,006 --> 00:41:11,865
But it looks alive.

795
00:41:11,866 --> 00:41:13,695
No, it's definitely alive!

796
00:41:13,696 --> 00:41:14,898
[Small Figure] Yep.

797
00:41:14,899 --> 00:41:16,255
Oh my God!

798
00:41:16,256 --> 00:41:18,195
Who or what are you?

799
00:41:18,196 --> 00:41:21,168
You have come at last, Rinne Amagane.

800
00:41:21,169 --> 00:41:22,751
I've been waiting here for ages.

801
00:41:22,752 --> 00:41:23,848
[Rinne] Whoa, that
swing looks dangerous.

802
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:25,825
Wait so are you another teacher?

803
00:41:25,826 --> 00:41:27,485
Of course not, I'm God.

804
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:29,565
Isn't that obvious?

805
00:41:29,566 --> 00:41:31,295
Damn you Rinne.

806
00:41:31,296 --> 00:41:32,725
I bet you're pretty pissed off that

807
00:41:32,726 --> 00:41:35,385
Rinne up and ruined your
date, huh, Phantoma?

808
00:41:35,386 --> 00:41:39,311
Well, actually, I kinda
just want to talk to her.

809
00:41:39,312 --> 00:41:41,255
That girl's got some guts.

810
00:41:41,256 --> 00:41:43,155
She made that clear during volleyball.

811
00:41:43,156 --> 00:41:45,043
So I'd like to hash it out.

812
00:41:48,966 --> 00:41:50,565
[Rinne] Well, that doesn't make sense.

813
00:41:50,566 --> 00:41:52,465
Isn't God supposed to be almighty?

814
00:41:52,466 --> 00:41:55,915
So why the heck is God in Hell?

815
00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:57,865
Well, you know what they say.

816
00:41:57,866 --> 00:41:59,186
God is dead!

817
00:41:59,187 --> 00:42:00,665
But never mind that.

818
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:03,225
Fact is, I'm not dead,
and neither are you.

819
00:42:03,226 --> 00:42:05,715
As Kutou said, this is all a mistake.

820
00:42:05,716 --> 00:42:07,805
Hell is where the dead discard their flesh

821
00:42:07,806 --> 00:42:10,167
and exist only as a soul, correct?

822
00:42:10,168 --> 00:42:11,001
[Rinne] Yeah.

823
00:42:11,002 --> 00:42:12,715
Then why are you still running around

824
00:42:12,716 --> 00:42:14,479
with all that flesh and blood?

825
00:42:15,636 --> 00:42:18,355
And therein lies the real mystery.

826
00:42:18,356 --> 00:42:19,488
In order to solve it,

827
00:42:19,489 --> 00:42:21,575
I will need to tell you the whole story

828
00:42:21,576 --> 00:42:23,495
of the brothers Cain and Abel.

829
00:42:23,496 --> 00:42:26,265
It has come to my attention
that one of those brothers

830
00:42:26,266 --> 00:42:28,365
has brought you here by sheer force

831
00:42:28,366 --> 00:42:30,795
in order to use you to their own ends.

832
00:42:30,796 --> 00:42:33,305
Mario told me about
Cain and Abel earlier.

833
00:42:33,306 --> 00:42:35,515
That was the first murder
ever committed, right?

834
00:42:35,516 --> 00:42:38,775
Indeed, the first blood
of humanity to be spilled

835
00:42:38,776 --> 00:42:42,235
came at the hands of Cain
upon his brother Abel.

836
00:42:42,236 --> 00:42:44,065
Cain as you know would then go on

837
00:42:44,066 --> 00:42:45,791
to become Headmaster Helvis.

838
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:48,965
But the soul of the
slain Abel lost it's way,

839
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:50,585
drifting in the Sanzu River,

840
00:42:50,586 --> 00:42:52,407
before creating Destiny Land to collect

841
00:42:52,408 --> 00:42:54,302
the souls of the dead.
(distant rumbling)

842
00:42:54,303 --> 00:42:56,645
All so that he may
capture his brother's soul

843
00:42:56,646 --> 00:42:59,295
and his exact his revenge
in a final battle.

844
00:42:59,296 --> 00:43:01,575
But then at the climax of that battle,

845
00:43:01,576 --> 00:43:03,535
Cain claimed victory and took Abel's soul

846
00:43:03,536 --> 00:43:05,065
and you're not listening.

847
00:43:05,066 --> 00:43:05,917
You hear that?

848
00:43:05,918 --> 00:43:08,546
It's beating, like a heartbeat.

849
00:43:08,547 --> 00:43:09,643
[God] For my sake listen to

850
00:43:09,644 --> 00:43:13,836
- God's imparting wisdom!
- Hold on just a sec.

851
00:43:13,837 --> 00:43:15,862
That was president Kutou!

852
00:43:15,863 --> 00:43:16,796
But why?

853
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:18,144
Incredible.

854
00:43:18,145 --> 00:43:20,519
So you really can feel it.

855
00:43:21,676 --> 00:43:25,005
The victorious Cain took
the source of Abel's power,

856
00:43:25,006 --> 00:43:28,715
his madness, and sealed
it away within this.

857
00:43:28,716 --> 00:43:29,865
[Rinne Voiceover] I get it now.

858
00:43:29,866 --> 00:43:31,825
President Kutou is Abel.

859
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:35,785
So if that's true, then
since Helvis is Cain,

860
00:43:35,786 --> 00:43:38,544
all of this is just a sibling rivalry!

861
00:43:38,545 --> 00:43:41,865
And the moment you arrived
at Sanzu River Academy,

862
00:43:41,866 --> 00:43:43,365
you were already thrust in

863
00:43:43,366 --> 00:43:45,435
the middle of their childish feud.

864
00:43:45,436 --> 00:43:46,935
But if you manage to put an end

865
00:43:46,936 --> 00:43:48,475
to their destructive squabble,

866
00:43:48,476 --> 00:43:49,985
you should be able to return to

867
00:43:49,986 --> 00:43:51,975
your world as well as your mother.

868
00:43:51,976 --> 00:43:53,845
It's all because of
these stupid brothers.

869
00:43:53,846 --> 00:43:55,165
- Hey now.
- Leave me out of this!

870
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:56,375
- That's not a toy.
- It hurts.

871
00:43:56,376 --> 00:43:58,085
There's a voice!

872
00:43:58,086 --> 00:43:59,471
[Voice] It hurts, mama.

873
00:43:59,472 --> 00:44:01,545
Mama, take it out!

874
00:44:01,546 --> 00:44:02,915
Please!

875
00:44:02,916 --> 00:44:04,605
So you can hear his voice!

876
00:44:04,606 --> 00:44:05,606
How?

877
00:44:12,126 --> 00:44:13,595
[Rinne Voiceover] I don't know why,

878
00:44:13,596 --> 00:44:16,055
but I feel like I need to pull this out.

879
00:44:16,056 --> 00:44:17,615
I have to do this.

880
00:44:17,616 --> 00:44:19,885
Somehow I understand.

881
00:44:19,886 --> 00:44:22,655
This isn't just the
pain of president Kutou.

882
00:44:22,656 --> 00:44:23,976
But of Helvis too!

883
00:44:28,911 --> 00:44:30,911
(gasps)

884
00:44:32,316 --> 00:44:33,316
It's out!

885
00:44:35,076 --> 00:44:37,285
I can't believe I actually did it.

886
00:44:37,286 --> 00:44:41,025
You've accomplished what
I never thought possible.

887
00:44:41,026 --> 00:44:43,215
You now hold in your hands the malice

888
00:44:43,216 --> 00:44:45,845
which my brother Abel bore toward me.

889
00:44:45,846 --> 00:44:48,455
It ensnared his fathomless madness.

890
00:44:48,456 --> 00:44:50,455
Do you realize what you've done?

891
00:44:50,456 --> 00:44:54,425
I'm ending this stupid fight,
and then I'm gonna go home!

892
00:44:54,426 --> 00:44:56,185
There is no escape for any of us

893
00:44:56,186 --> 00:44:58,235
if you do not correct this now.

894
00:44:58,236 --> 00:44:59,945
If Abel regains his madness,

895
00:44:59,946 --> 00:45:02,985
then Hell and every soul
trapped within it is doomed.

896
00:45:02,986 --> 00:45:04,815
There's still time, Rinne.

897
00:45:04,816 --> 00:45:08,383
Replace the crux of hatred
before Abel's madness awakens.

898
00:45:08,384 --> 00:45:10,587
I don't know or care about any of that!

899
00:45:10,588 --> 00:45:12,539
But I do know I'm done messing around!

900
00:45:17,156 --> 00:45:18,943
[God] Uh-oh.

901
00:45:18,944 --> 00:45:21,440
- Gross!
- Oh my God!

902
00:45:21,441 --> 00:45:23,283
Damn it all, this is it!

903
00:45:23,284 --> 00:45:25,639
The madness of Abel!

904
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,640
What?

905
00:45:28,116 --> 00:45:29,489
[Helvis] It's too late now.

906
00:45:30,406 --> 00:45:31,655
That's what this is?

907
00:45:31,656 --> 00:45:34,085
So it's actually Kutou's?

908
00:45:34,086 --> 00:45:35,086
Why is it?

909
00:45:36,416 --> 00:45:37,416
[God] Go.

910
00:45:38,216 --> 00:45:39,216
She's gone.

911
00:45:41,186 --> 00:45:43,786
Tell me where you sent her
you wretched old bastard!

912
00:45:44,672 --> 00:45:46,645
Did you see that Helvis?

913
00:45:46,646 --> 00:45:49,245
Abel's madness holds more jet black malice

914
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:52,215
than even I the creator
could begin to fathom.

915
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:54,331
I couldn't stop it, even if I tried,

916
00:45:54,332 --> 00:45:56,695
and neither can you.

917
00:45:56,696 --> 00:45:59,735
But on the other hand,
what about the girl?

918
00:45:59,736 --> 00:46:01,485
She's still so young.

919
00:46:01,486 --> 00:46:04,219
You can't just thrust
that burden upon her!

920
00:46:05,636 --> 00:46:08,846
Deep in that accursed heart,
I know you long for this.

921
00:46:10,128 --> 00:46:11,385
Damn you!

922
00:46:11,386 --> 00:46:12,709
God damn you!

923
00:46:22,652 --> 00:46:24,985
(chuckling)

924
00:46:27,362 --> 00:46:28,995
[Phantoma] It's headed this way!

925
00:46:28,996 --> 00:46:31,286
Steela, get out of the way!

926
00:46:33,936 --> 00:46:37,531
[Ryu] There's nothing
better than pure madness.

927
00:46:37,532 --> 00:46:38,365
Steela!

928
00:46:38,365 --> 00:46:39,220
[Ryu] What?

929
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:40,220
No way!

930
00:46:41,186 --> 00:46:42,186
Take this!

931
00:46:53,474 --> 00:46:56,557
(Gatekeepers scream)

932
00:47:00,478 --> 00:47:02,165
What the hell are you deviants doing?

933
00:47:02,166 --> 00:47:05,253
Well, something must be going
on at Sanzu River Academy.

934
00:47:05,254 --> 00:47:06,477
Spit it out already!

935
00:47:06,478 --> 00:47:08,065
Please help me.

936
00:47:08,066 --> 00:47:11,149
(shouting in dismay)

937
00:47:16,182 --> 00:47:17,932
What just happened?

938
00:47:19,678 --> 00:47:21,035
Kitty cat!

939
00:47:21,036 --> 00:47:23,595
[God] Not just any
kitty cat, 'tis I, God.

940
00:47:23,596 --> 00:47:24,945
What, hold on.

941
00:47:24,946 --> 00:47:27,522
Aren't you that kitty I saved
from the traffic accident?

942
00:47:27,523 --> 00:47:30,345
[God] I'm so sorry for not
being able to protect you then.

943
00:47:30,346 --> 00:47:31,256
Protect me?

944
00:47:31,257 --> 00:47:33,585
Wait, cats aren't supposed to talk, right?

945
00:47:33,586 --> 00:47:35,205
[God] I'll explain it all later, Rinne.

946
00:47:35,206 --> 00:47:38,145
But first we must take
care of the issue at hand!

947
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,336
You're right, Steela!

948
00:47:41,846 --> 00:47:44,195
Hey, I'm gonna get you
down from there, okay?

949
00:47:44,196 --> 00:47:46,045
[God] Abel has permanently locked down

950
00:47:46,046 --> 00:47:49,695
Sanzu River Academy using Steela's body.

951
00:47:49,696 --> 00:47:50,879
Be on your guard.

952
00:47:54,536 --> 00:47:56,021
[Rinne] Take this!

953
00:47:56,022 --> 00:47:57,793
[Kiki] Rinne, please
don't do it, come on,

954
00:47:57,794 --> 00:47:59,277
it's too dangerous, we need to run!

955
00:47:59,278 --> 00:48:00,278
Steela!

956
00:48:01,394 --> 00:48:02,644
Snap out of it!

957
00:48:04,118 --> 00:48:05,451
Come back to us!

958
00:48:07,819 --> 00:48:08,819
But why?

959
00:48:09,566 --> 00:48:11,485
This is totally crazy you guys.

960
00:48:11,486 --> 00:48:12,945
Let's just leave.

961
00:48:12,946 --> 00:48:15,409
Dumb ass, get your butt
over here and help us!

962
00:48:17,962 --> 00:48:19,905
Girls, this isn't like you.

963
00:48:19,906 --> 00:48:21,825
Who cares about stupid old Steela?

964
00:48:21,826 --> 00:48:22,659
Forget her and let's get...

965
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:23,905
Bite your damn tongue!

966
00:48:23,906 --> 00:48:24,856
We can't just leave her.

967
00:48:24,857 --> 00:48:27,515
We've only gotten this far
because she's our friend!

968
00:48:27,516 --> 00:48:28,685
That's the ticket!

969
00:48:28,686 --> 00:48:31,555
Even Hell has no use for
fair-weather friends.

970
00:48:31,556 --> 00:48:33,221
Whoa, but that's bad weather.

971
00:48:33,222 --> 00:48:34,295
[Rinne] Mario!

972
00:48:34,296 --> 00:48:37,545
Holy crap, what in
the world happened here?

973
00:48:37,546 --> 00:48:40,029
Dammit, she won't budge at all!

974
00:48:42,646 --> 00:48:44,105
- Mario.
- Oh good,

975
00:48:44,106 --> 00:48:45,415
nice of you to join.

976
00:48:45,416 --> 00:48:46,985
We came as fast as we could.

977
00:48:46,986 --> 00:48:48,335
[Luca] This is bad.

978
00:48:48,336 --> 00:48:51,063
[Mario] Rinne, just what
the hell happened to Steela?

979
00:48:51,064 --> 00:48:53,619
And how come there's suddenly
a heart in her chest?

980
00:48:54,704 --> 00:48:56,245
It's Abel's madness.

981
00:48:56,246 --> 00:48:57,312
I accidentally released it,

982
00:48:57,313 --> 00:48:59,995
and now I think it's trying to use Steela.

983
00:48:59,996 --> 00:49:01,468
Wait a sec, did you say Abel's?

984
00:49:01,469 --> 00:49:05,305
[Rinne] I found out that
president Kutou is actually Abel.

985
00:49:05,306 --> 00:49:06,515
Why didn't you tell me?

986
00:49:06,516 --> 00:49:08,466
Did you know about this the whole time?

987
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:15,305
Is there anything more uniquely
beautiful than friendship?

988
00:49:15,306 --> 00:49:17,935
One might even say friends are invaluable.

989
00:49:17,936 --> 00:49:19,575
Wouldn't you agree?

990
00:49:19,576 --> 00:49:22,085
- Cut the bull.
- What are you talking about?

991
00:49:22,086 --> 00:49:23,836
[Mario] Tell us the truth, Kutou!

992
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:26,817
(screaming)

993
00:49:26,818 --> 00:49:28,405
Steela, what are you?

994
00:49:28,406 --> 00:49:30,941
Son of a, hey what's the deal, Steela?

995
00:49:30,942 --> 00:49:31,942
Kutou!

996
00:49:32,616 --> 00:49:35,135
[God] Unifying Steela to
put her under your control

997
00:49:35,136 --> 00:49:38,245
was just the beginning
of your plan, wasn't it?

998
00:49:38,246 --> 00:49:39,246
Abel!

999
00:49:44,467 --> 00:49:46,705
Thank you, miss Amagane.

1000
00:49:46,706 --> 00:49:47,815
I do owe you.

1001
00:49:47,816 --> 00:49:50,495
Dragging you to Hell
was worth it after all.

1002
00:49:50,496 --> 00:49:51,955
And now, finally!

1003
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:54,159
But wait, what are you saying?

1004
00:50:01,586 --> 00:50:03,036
[Ryu Voiceover] This is it.

1005
00:50:05,326 --> 00:50:06,539
This is my heart.

1006
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:10,880
And within it, my true self!

1007
00:50:10,881 --> 00:50:12,964
(laughs)

1008
00:50:21,716 --> 00:50:24,243
(chuckles)

1009
00:50:24,244 --> 00:50:26,507
(screaming)

1010
00:50:26,508 --> 00:50:27,696
[Rinne] What's going on?

1011
00:50:27,697 --> 00:50:28,778
Get a hold of yourselves!

1012
00:50:28,779 --> 00:50:31,029
Unfortunately, Luca, Rei.

1013
00:50:31,943 --> 00:50:33,409
This is goodbye.

1014
00:50:37,463 --> 00:50:38,662
(screaming)

1015
00:50:38,663 --> 00:50:41,163
Luca, come on, take my hand!

1016
00:50:44,044 --> 00:50:46,012
[Rinne] They're gone.

1017
00:50:46,013 --> 00:50:46,976
[Mario] Where'd they go?

1018
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:49,015
[Ryu] They didn't go anywhere.

1019
00:50:49,016 --> 00:50:52,465
Rather, they're nowhere
at all, they're nothing.

1020
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,005
Shall I explain?

1021
00:50:54,006 --> 00:50:56,245
Steela has the power of nothingness.

1022
00:50:56,246 --> 00:50:59,350
Those consumed by her vanish.

1023
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:03,285
Since only the soul of a
person can exist down in Hell,

1024
00:51:03,286 --> 00:51:06,325
what do you think happens
when that soul is erased?

1025
00:51:06,326 --> 00:51:10,649
This power within Steela has
been unleashed by my madness.

1026
00:51:11,556 --> 00:51:12,685
How could you?

1027
00:51:12,686 --> 00:51:14,855
Luca and Rei were your
friends, weren't they?

1028
00:51:14,856 --> 00:51:17,045
How you could do something like that!

1029
00:51:17,046 --> 00:51:18,515
[Ryu] My friends?

1030
00:51:18,516 --> 00:51:21,835
All I've ever had were
fools dancing to my whims!

1031
00:51:21,836 --> 00:51:22,875
I trusted you.

1032
00:51:22,876 --> 00:51:25,805
I gave you our trust, you bastard!

1033
00:51:25,806 --> 00:51:27,495
We were supposed to be a team!

1034
00:51:27,496 --> 00:51:29,588
Hey, Mario, your arm.

1035
00:51:29,589 --> 00:51:32,055
Kutou, God damn it!

1036
00:51:32,056 --> 00:51:34,515
I thought we were supposed
to beat Helvis together!

1037
00:51:34,516 --> 00:51:35,962
Didn't you say the only
way we could escape

1038
00:51:35,963 --> 00:51:38,315
was by altering the cycle of rebirth

1039
00:51:38,316 --> 00:51:40,065
and to fix it we would have to defeat

1040
00:51:40,066 --> 00:51:42,442
who created Hell in the first place?

1041
00:51:42,443 --> 00:51:45,225
(grunts)

1042
00:51:45,226 --> 00:51:47,439
[Ryu] Don't take it personally, Mario.

1043
00:51:49,396 --> 00:51:50,890
[Mario Voiceover] Bastard.

1044
00:51:50,891 --> 00:51:52,709
I thought we were friends.

1045
00:51:54,646 --> 00:51:58,655
Kutou, you dragged me here
and then you lied to me,

1046
00:51:58,656 --> 00:51:59,965
and to Mario!

1047
00:51:59,966 --> 00:52:02,742
You lied to all of us for
your own selfish gain!

1048
00:52:02,743 --> 00:52:04,215
And so what if I did?

1049
00:52:04,216 --> 00:52:07,325
To escape my own personal
Hell I needed mama's blood,

1050
00:52:07,326 --> 00:52:08,665
and as the reincarnation of

1051
00:52:08,666 --> 00:52:10,805
my dear sweet mother miss Amagane,

1052
00:52:10,806 --> 00:52:11,823
I needed you.

1053
00:52:12,683 --> 00:52:13,875
[Rinne Voiceover] Mama?

1054
00:52:13,876 --> 00:52:17,505
Now to let the final
piece fall into place.

1055
00:52:17,506 --> 00:52:18,506
Hold on.

1056
00:52:19,196 --> 00:52:22,099
Don't be so selfish, baby.

1057
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,433
Headmaster Helvis?

1058
00:52:24,434 --> 00:52:26,925
I can't even process
what's happening anymore.

1059
00:52:26,926 --> 00:52:28,895
Just what is going on here?

1060
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:31,235
[Ryu] Fine, then I shall elucidate.

1061
00:52:31,236 --> 00:52:33,545
My brother and I are a mortal sin,

1062
00:52:33,546 --> 00:52:37,255
and as our mother, you must
atone for our very birth.

1063
00:52:37,256 --> 00:52:40,005
You keep saying mama
this and mother that.

1064
00:52:40,006 --> 00:52:41,755
It seems as though my faithful servants

1065
00:52:41,756 --> 00:52:43,669
have finally awakened.

1066
00:52:45,431 --> 00:52:47,514
(groans)

1067
00:52:56,126 --> 00:52:57,585
The seven deadly sins have

1068
00:52:57,586 --> 00:52:59,935
existed since humanities inception.

1069
00:52:59,936 --> 00:53:02,145
There were also seven demons that embodied

1070
00:53:02,146 --> 00:53:03,715
and governed those sins.

1071
00:53:03,716 --> 00:53:05,345
I came across across
them as I flowed through

1072
00:53:05,346 --> 00:53:08,375
the depths of Hell after
my ill-fated death.

1073
00:53:08,376 --> 00:53:10,125
I saw use for their power,

1074
00:53:10,126 --> 00:53:11,885
so in order to exact my revenge

1075
00:53:11,886 --> 00:53:13,705
I formed a contract with them.

1076
00:53:13,706 --> 00:53:15,225
Through that contract they became

1077
00:53:15,226 --> 00:53:17,325
the students you met in your class.

1078
00:53:17,326 --> 00:53:20,735
But after my battle with Cain
their madness was sealed away,

1079
00:53:20,736 --> 00:53:22,014
along with my own.

1080
00:53:22,015 --> 00:53:25,975
And now your silly friends
have reawakened as my servants.

1081
00:53:25,976 --> 00:53:27,358
Liar!

1082
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:29,066
That can't be true.

1083
00:53:29,067 --> 00:53:31,030
(chuckles) It doesn't matter.

1084
00:53:31,031 --> 00:53:34,265
They say that God created
the entire world in a week.

1085
00:53:34,266 --> 00:53:37,825
So why don't we see if I can
destroy it in one as well?

1086
00:53:37,826 --> 00:53:40,335
Now, you shall atone.

1087
00:53:40,336 --> 00:53:41,425
'Tis a mercy, really,

1088
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:44,035
being spared the horrors
of the apocalypse.

1089
00:53:44,036 --> 00:53:45,599
Farewell, mama.

1090
00:53:46,896 --> 00:53:49,259
Not even death cures stupidity, does it?

1091
00:53:50,231 --> 00:53:52,314
(grunts)

1092
00:53:53,606 --> 00:53:56,865
Now now Abel, acting out
at this age is one thing.

1093
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:59,446
But you should show your
parents more affection.

1094
00:53:59,447 --> 00:54:01,185
[Ryu and Helvis] Impossible!

1095
00:54:01,186 --> 00:54:02,108
[Rinne Voiceover] Parents?

1096
00:54:02,109 --> 00:54:06,122
Oh honey don't tell me you've
already forgotten who I am?

1097
00:54:06,123 --> 00:54:07,555
Forget you?

1098
00:54:07,556 --> 00:54:10,064
- Also don't call me honey!
- Good grief.

1099
00:54:10,065 --> 00:54:11,053
He made it by the skin of his teeth.

1100
00:54:11,054 --> 00:54:12,715
[Rinne] Just tell me who you are!

1101
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,303
It's me, Who!

1102
00:54:14,304 --> 00:54:19,195
In a way way way past
life, I was your husband.

1103
00:54:19,196 --> 00:54:20,485
It's our daddy.

1104
00:54:20,486 --> 00:54:22,735
And what do you think you're doing here?

1105
00:54:22,736 --> 00:54:24,125
Hello there papa.

1106
00:54:24,126 --> 00:54:26,915
I'd say it's been too
long, but I won't lie.

1107
00:54:26,916 --> 00:54:28,635
I wasn't expecting the warmest welcome,

1108
00:54:28,636 --> 00:54:30,515
but this is simply far too much.

1109
00:54:30,516 --> 00:54:33,266
Honey, we have got to do
something about our dumb kids.

1110
00:54:35,216 --> 00:54:38,605
[God] Rinne, that man
is the first human, Adam.

1111
00:54:38,606 --> 00:54:42,067
And you are the reincarnation
of his wife, Eve.

1112
00:54:42,068 --> 00:54:44,395
[Rinne Voiceover] Adam? Eve?

1113
00:54:44,396 --> 00:54:45,396
That's right, Eve.

1114
00:54:45,397 --> 00:54:47,375
Though I suspect you prefer Rinne now.

1115
00:54:47,376 --> 00:54:48,975
You and I have come all the way to Hell

1116
00:54:48,976 --> 00:54:52,343
in order to finally put our
kids' ceaseless fighting.

1117
00:54:52,344 --> 00:54:53,177
[Rinne] What?

1118
00:54:53,178 --> 00:54:54,735
You can meddle as you wish.

1119
00:54:54,736 --> 00:54:56,835
There's nothing that can stop me now.

1120
00:54:56,836 --> 00:54:57,969
- Oh no!
- Hell no!

1121
00:54:59,058 --> 00:55:00,308
Bear witness!

1122
00:55:01,526 --> 00:55:04,866
Mama, papa, I will show you true Hell!

1123
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,657
(concerned shouts)

1124
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:18,485
What the hell is this?

1125
00:55:18,486 --> 00:55:19,705
[God] It's bad!

1126
00:55:19,706 --> 00:55:21,863
Oh, what have I done?

1127
00:55:21,864 --> 00:55:25,159
Rinne, I should have
never put this on you!

1128
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:32,869
(laughs)

1129
00:55:43,116 --> 00:55:45,366
(chuckles)

1130
00:55:53,964 --> 00:55:55,071
Save me, please!

1131
00:55:55,072 --> 00:55:57,367
Who's gonna save the rest
of us, you little moron?

1132
00:55:57,368 --> 00:56:00,285
(concerned shouts)

1133
00:56:06,064 --> 00:56:06,920
[Mario] Rinne!

1134
00:56:06,921 --> 00:56:08,003
[Rinne] No!

1135
00:56:13,113 --> 00:56:14,155
[Who] You okay?

1136
00:56:14,156 --> 00:56:15,663
[Rinne] Yeah thanks Who.

1137
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:16,497
[Who] Call me dear.

1138
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:19,049
We were lovers a long long long time ago.

1139
00:56:20,096 --> 00:56:22,825
Holy crap, it's a good thing
that guy is so damn fast,

1140
00:56:22,826 --> 00:56:24,576
or we would have lost her for sure.

1141
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,706
What the frick is that?

1142
00:56:36,576 --> 00:56:38,076
Steela, stop it!

1143
00:56:39,216 --> 00:56:40,997
They're vanishing!

1144
00:56:40,998 --> 00:56:42,248
Stop it please!

1145
00:56:44,586 --> 00:56:47,355
Papa, mama.

1146
00:56:47,356 --> 00:56:49,945
Every soul in Hell will
plummet into that pit

1147
00:56:49,946 --> 00:56:52,485
and be consumed by the nothingness.

1148
00:56:52,486 --> 00:56:54,415
From now on the souls of the dead

1149
00:56:54,416 --> 00:56:56,745
that fall to Hell will be eradicated.

1150
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,115
And this will continue until

1151
00:56:58,116 --> 00:57:00,549
all remaining life is extinguished.

1152
00:57:01,726 --> 00:57:04,055
The suffering of humanity is inescapable

1153
00:57:04,056 --> 00:57:06,145
as long as this abhorrent cycle of rebirth

1154
00:57:06,146 --> 00:57:08,425
continues to force us back to life.

1155
00:57:08,426 --> 00:57:10,675
But you will find no pain nor sadness

1156
00:57:10,676 --> 00:57:12,385
in a world of nothingness.

1157
00:57:12,386 --> 00:57:14,812
Now accept the salvation
I've bestowed, mama.

1158
00:57:14,813 --> 00:57:16,802
Hey come on, what's wrong with you guys?

1159
00:57:16,803 --> 00:57:19,695
Rinne, what you are
seeing is their true selves.

1160
00:57:19,696 --> 00:57:23,325
Papa, mama, struggle
in futility all you wish.

1161
00:57:23,326 --> 00:57:25,235
Today is my Blue Monday.

1162
00:57:25,236 --> 00:57:27,999
Only six days left until the world ends.

1163
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:31,595
(screams)

1164
00:57:31,596 --> 00:57:33,269
[Rinne] Door Mother, Pandaz, hang on!

1165
00:57:35,106 --> 00:57:36,565
[Ryu] Mama, look!

1166
00:57:36,566 --> 00:57:38,605
Watch them tumble and vanish!

1167
00:57:38,606 --> 00:57:40,643
Hurry up and save them!

1168
00:57:40,644 --> 00:57:41,644
How awful.

1169
00:57:45,078 --> 00:57:45,911
(groans)

1170
00:57:45,912 --> 00:57:48,955
It'd be easier if you
just embraced despair.

1171
00:57:48,956 --> 00:57:52,245
After all, you're too weak to save anyone.

1172
00:57:52,246 --> 00:57:53,889
Good bye, mama.

1173
00:58:01,646 --> 00:58:03,875
I'm never letting you
go ever again, honey.

1174
00:58:03,876 --> 00:58:05,935
Oh still you're still that
cheerfully reckless girl

1175
00:58:05,936 --> 00:58:06,926
I fell in love with aren't you?

1176
00:58:06,927 --> 00:58:08,812
Be still my heart!

1177
00:58:08,813 --> 00:58:10,005
But you should know there's

1178
00:58:10,006 --> 00:58:11,365
no business trying to protect

1179
00:58:11,366 --> 00:58:13,535
other people if you
cannot protect yourself.

1180
00:58:13,536 --> 00:58:15,315
[Door Mother] Hey don't
touch Rin like that!

1181
00:58:15,316 --> 00:58:16,306
[Who] Acting without concern

1182
00:58:16,307 --> 00:58:18,865
for your own life is not
heroic, it's foolish.

1183
00:58:18,866 --> 00:58:20,635
You worthless giant brat!

1184
00:58:20,636 --> 00:58:21,967
If Rinne hadn't been there to catch us,

1185
00:58:21,968 --> 00:58:24,459
that moronic panda and I would be dead!

1186
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:27,443
[Rinne] He's right, I'm stupid.

1187
00:58:27,444 --> 00:58:30,083
But I can't leave them.

1188
00:58:30,084 --> 00:58:30,917
- Damn it, damn it!
- Don't be so

1189
00:58:30,917 --> 00:58:31,826
hard on yourself.

1190
00:58:31,827 --> 00:58:33,455
That foolish abandon is your charm,

1191
00:58:33,456 --> 00:58:35,159
and partly why I fell for you.

1192
00:58:36,033 --> 00:58:39,519
- Listen Rinne, to be honest.
- Bye bye, baby!

1193
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,362
That's who you are, Rinne Amagane.

1194
00:58:41,363 --> 00:58:44,158
- You do you girl!
- Damn it king, seriously?

1195
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:45,229
You stole my thunder!

1196
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:50,483
My brother, I leave Abel to you.

1197
00:58:56,996 --> 00:58:57,996
Hey!

1198
00:59:01,316 --> 00:59:04,399
Hey Abel, come on out, it's papa!

1199
00:59:05,726 --> 00:59:07,605
You can stop now!

1200
00:59:07,606 --> 00:59:10,759
Are those song birds I hear, or pests?

1201
00:59:11,666 --> 00:59:13,645
If you wish to see master Abel,

1202
00:59:13,646 --> 00:59:15,425
you'll have to get through me.

1203
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:17,935
Don't be so ridiculous
Phantoma, we're friends.

1204
00:59:17,936 --> 00:59:19,655
I couldn't possibly fight you.

1205
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:21,339
[Phantoma] Then you should
just shut up and leave.

1206
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:22,326
[Rinne] Hold on a sec!

1207
00:59:22,327 --> 00:59:24,595
[Phantoma] Ever the
persistent little brat.

1208
00:59:24,596 --> 00:59:27,025
Master Abel has already made up his mind.

1209
00:59:27,026 --> 00:59:29,085
[Rinne] No matter what
happened before we met,

1210
00:59:29,086 --> 00:59:31,475
I know you're better than this, please!

1211
00:59:31,476 --> 00:59:32,619
Is that so?

1212
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:34,378
No matter what?

1213
00:59:34,379 --> 00:59:37,655
If you knew the truth behind
Cain murdering his brother,

1214
00:59:37,656 --> 00:59:39,235
would you still say that?

1215
00:59:39,236 --> 00:59:41,783
I'll show you, come!

1216
00:59:41,784 --> 00:59:44,645
That is if you think
you're prepared to see

1217
00:59:44,646 --> 00:59:47,591
the truth behind humanity's first murder.

1218
00:59:47,592 --> 00:59:52,155
So I guess it's abandon all
hope, ye who enter here, huh?

1219
00:59:52,156 --> 00:59:54,265
Whatever. (sighs)

1220
00:59:54,266 --> 00:59:55,854
All right, hope abandoned.

1221
00:59:55,855 --> 00:59:57,368
Stop joking around!

1222
00:59:57,369 --> 01:00:00,077
There's no way I could.

1223
01:00:00,078 --> 01:00:01,828
I'll never lose hope!

1224
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:14,348
[Group] Whoa, what the Hell?

1225
01:00:14,349 --> 01:00:17,325
Hang on, did you guys follow us?

1226
01:00:17,326 --> 01:00:19,162
[God] Rinne, hurry, search for Phantoma!

1227
01:00:19,163 --> 01:00:21,443
[Rinne] All right Rokku, I'm on it.

1228
01:00:21,444 --> 01:00:23,527
[Door Mother] The door!

1229
01:00:26,043 --> 01:00:28,425
[Phantoma] Gross, who piled
up all this trash in here?

1230
01:00:28,426 --> 01:00:32,155
[Rinne] Phantoma, let me
speak with president Kutou!

1231
01:00:32,156 --> 01:00:33,159
With Abel!

1232
01:00:34,746 --> 01:00:37,365
[Phantoma] Setting foot in
here means learning the truth.

1233
01:00:37,366 --> 01:00:39,215
Tell me, will you be able to live

1234
01:00:39,216 --> 01:00:41,035
with the knowledge you acquire?

1235
01:00:41,036 --> 01:00:43,036
[Mario] Quit screwing with us already!

1236
01:00:44,836 --> 01:00:47,355
[Phantoma] Cast that stone
into the well before you.

1237
01:00:47,356 --> 01:00:49,575
The ripples will reveal the truth.

1238
01:00:49,576 --> 01:00:52,505
Show me your resolve, Rinne Amagane.

1239
01:00:52,506 --> 01:00:54,225
Then we'll talk.

1240
01:00:54,226 --> 01:00:56,335
[Rinne Voiceover] Phantoma's
right about one thing.

1241
01:00:56,336 --> 01:00:59,123
I'm only here now because
I didn't have a choice.

1242
01:00:59,124 --> 01:01:01,575
I won't hesitate anymore.

1243
01:01:01,576 --> 01:01:04,903
I have to do this, it's my decision.

1244
01:01:04,904 --> 01:01:07,093
This stone is my choice.

1245
01:01:17,056 --> 01:01:19,215
Wait, it's showing something.

1246
01:01:19,216 --> 01:01:20,559
Who's that?

1247
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,669
[Who] I think that's you, Rinne.

1248
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:23,606
Maybe?

1249
01:01:23,607 --> 01:01:25,829
You two look mostly the same.

1250
01:01:26,886 --> 01:01:27,719
And who's that?

1251
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,479
It's a young me!

1252
01:01:30,766 --> 01:01:31,809
[God] Oh, this is.

1253
01:01:32,796 --> 01:01:35,527
Uh, hey, Adam, is Eve all right?

1254
01:01:35,528 --> 01:01:36,919
Is this enough water?

1255
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,555
Huh?

1256
01:01:38,556 --> 01:01:39,709
What?

1257
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:42,965
(God gasping)

1258
01:01:42,966 --> 01:01:43,906
[Adam] You did it, Eve!

1259
01:01:43,907 --> 01:01:46,315
You're the best, this is great!

1260
01:01:46,316 --> 01:01:48,105
[Eve] Dear please don't shout.

1261
01:01:48,106 --> 01:01:49,026
[Adam] How can I not?

1262
01:01:49,027 --> 01:01:51,085
I'm overjoyed beyond words, honey!

1263
01:01:51,086 --> 01:01:52,965
[Who Voiceover] I remember.

1264
01:01:52,966 --> 01:01:54,955
[Eve] But you'll scare Cain, sweetie.

1265
01:01:54,956 --> 01:01:55,886
[Adam] Cain, what?

1266
01:01:55,887 --> 01:01:59,135
Oh that's our son's name, it's perfect!

1267
01:01:59,136 --> 01:02:00,455
[Eve] Cain stood up!

1268
01:02:00,456 --> 01:02:03,735
[Adam] Wow, he's a genius!

1269
01:02:03,736 --> 01:02:05,462
[Eve] What a silly papa, huh Cain?

1270
01:02:05,463 --> 01:02:06,815
[Adam] Papa's gonna work hard!

1271
01:02:06,816 --> 01:02:09,591
[God] Honestly as I think back on it,

1272
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:12,155
when you and Eve ate the forbidden fruit

1273
01:02:12,156 --> 01:02:13,627
and were expelled from Eden,

1274
01:02:13,628 --> 01:02:16,635
I couldn't help but worry about you two.

1275
01:02:16,636 --> 01:02:18,375
[Adam] Hey, so uh, God?

1276
01:02:18,376 --> 01:02:20,245
[God] Speak your mind, Adam.

1277
01:02:20,246 --> 01:02:22,085
[Adam] Did it feel this way for you too?

1278
01:02:22,086 --> 01:02:24,049
When you made, I mean.

1279
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:26,665
[God] (chuckles)
Where's this coming from?

1280
01:02:26,666 --> 01:02:29,215
[Adam] It's just,
being a family is great.

1281
01:02:29,216 --> 01:02:32,485
I think maybe this is
why we ate that fruit.

1282
01:02:32,486 --> 01:02:33,609
[God] Is that so?

1283
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,448
[Adam] Cain, no hitting!

1284
01:02:38,449 --> 01:02:41,278
What, are you jealous of your new brother?

1285
01:02:41,279 --> 01:02:42,809
Huh, you silly boy.

1286
01:02:44,486 --> 01:02:47,465
[Cain] Hey mama, let me have some too!

1287
01:02:47,466 --> 01:02:49,525
[Adam] No Cain, you're
a big brother now.

1288
01:02:49,526 --> 01:02:51,175
Stop being so difficult.

1289
01:02:51,176 --> 01:02:52,066
I'm sad too,

1290
01:02:52,067 --> 01:02:54,595
but those breasts just
don't belong to us anymore.

1291
01:02:54,596 --> 01:02:56,124
Now they're Abel's.

1292
01:02:56,125 --> 01:02:57,959
(laughs) Lucky kid!

1293
01:02:59,266 --> 01:03:01,474
[Cain] Milk mama, milk!

1294
01:03:01,475 --> 01:03:04,735
[Eve] Nuh-uh, big brothers
don't drink from here.

1295
01:03:04,736 --> 01:03:06,303
[Cain] Fine.

1296
01:03:06,304 --> 01:03:07,196
(whimpering)

1297
01:03:07,197 --> 01:03:09,485
[Eve] Abel, how did you get that wound?

1298
01:03:09,486 --> 01:03:10,849
[Cain] Don't worry mother, it's fine.

1299
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:13,225
We got a bit carried
away doing field work,

1300
01:03:13,226 --> 01:03:14,295
it's just a scratch.

1301
01:03:14,296 --> 01:03:15,708
[Mario] This is Abel?

1302
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:17,155
What a crybaby.

1303
01:03:17,156 --> 01:03:18,856
[Door Mother] Shut it, imbecile.

1304
01:03:19,736 --> 01:03:21,368
But they're supposed
to be a happy family.

1305
01:03:21,369 --> 01:03:24,059
There's no way they
could raise a murderer.

1306
01:03:25,076 --> 01:03:26,987
[God] It may seem that way Rinne,

1307
01:03:26,988 --> 01:03:30,105
but you in your previous life as Eve

1308
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:32,605
are tied intrinsically to that tragedy.

1309
01:03:32,606 --> 01:03:33,695
[Rinne] But how?

1310
01:03:33,696 --> 01:03:34,785
[Cain] Thank you for the meal.

1311
01:03:34,786 --> 01:03:36,675
[Adam] Hey, is something wrong, Cain?

1312
01:03:36,676 --> 01:03:38,945
You're not done growing yet, eat up!

1313
01:03:38,946 --> 01:03:40,005
[Eve] You too, Abel.

1314
01:03:40,006 --> 01:03:41,145
Aren't you hungry?

1315
01:03:41,146 --> 01:03:41,979
[Abel] Sure.

1316
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:43,035
[Eve] Are you feeling sick or something?

1317
01:03:43,036 --> 01:03:45,115
[Cain] What is this urge?

1318
01:03:45,116 --> 01:03:46,913
I can't bear it anymore!

1319
01:03:46,914 --> 01:03:50,075
I want to feel mama's naked body!

1320
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,026
[Eve] Now Abel,

1321
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:54,145
you can't keep running to
mama ever time you get scared.

1322
01:03:54,146 --> 01:03:56,955
You have to grow up one day, understand?

1323
01:03:56,956 --> 01:04:00,115
Look dear, I guess our
Abel is still just a kid.

1324
01:04:00,116 --> 01:04:01,235
(snores) But you would know

1325
01:04:01,236 --> 01:04:02,869
all about that wouldn't you?

1326
01:04:06,716 --> 01:04:10,369
[Cain] God, why is it
that you created humans?

1327
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:12,539
How come you created me?

1328
01:04:13,409 --> 01:04:16,616
[God] I created your
parents, Adam and Eve,

1329
01:04:16,617 --> 01:04:18,745
and in turn your parents were

1330
01:04:18,746 --> 01:04:20,785
the ones who created you and Abel.

1331
01:04:20,786 --> 01:04:24,795
It was your parents' choice
to give birth to you both.

1332
01:04:24,796 --> 01:04:27,575
A choice made of their own free will.

1333
01:04:27,576 --> 01:04:28,795
[Cain] A choice?

1334
01:04:28,796 --> 01:04:30,815
[God] Likewise of their own volition,

1335
01:04:30,816 --> 01:04:33,655
Adam and Eve chose to
eat the forbidden fruit.

1336
01:04:33,656 --> 01:04:37,588
To make a decision and act
upon it, that is choice.

1337
01:04:37,589 --> 01:04:40,205
You and Abel were born
to live in this world

1338
01:04:40,206 --> 01:04:42,425
as a result of human desire.

1339
01:04:42,426 --> 01:04:44,455
In other words making choices

1340
01:04:44,456 --> 01:04:46,909
is precisely what life is about.

1341
01:04:49,396 --> 01:04:51,076
[Abel] Big brother, look.

1342
01:04:51,077 --> 01:04:53,499
I found the lamb we lost yesterday.

1343
01:04:54,376 --> 01:04:58,569
Hey, that tickles, stop! (laughs)

1344
01:05:00,226 --> 01:05:01,885
[Adam] What does that mean, Cain?

1345
01:05:01,886 --> 01:05:03,935
Abel won't be coming home again?

1346
01:05:03,936 --> 01:05:05,476
What are you talking about?

1347
01:05:05,477 --> 01:05:06,403
[Eve] Where did he go?

1348
01:05:06,404 --> 01:05:08,169
Where did Abel go?

1349
01:05:09,276 --> 01:05:10,276
[Cain] Hell.

1350
01:05:11,385 --> 01:05:13,348
[Eve] That blood.

1351
01:05:13,349 --> 01:05:14,182
[Adam] Hell?

1352
01:05:14,183 --> 01:05:15,345
What is that?

1353
01:05:15,346 --> 01:05:16,326
Where is it?

1354
01:05:16,327 --> 01:05:17,505
[Eve] You can't mean.

1355
01:05:17,506 --> 01:05:19,235
[Cain] I made a choice.

1356
01:05:19,236 --> 01:05:22,775
It was mine to make, to
kill the one I hated.

1357
01:05:22,776 --> 01:05:26,788
The one who stole all of
mama and papa's love from me!

1358
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:28,875
Damn you Abel, damn you!

1359
01:05:28,876 --> 01:05:32,275
Why, why brother?

1360
01:05:32,276 --> 01:05:35,236
Why does my chest feel this pain?

1361
01:05:35,237 --> 01:05:37,320
Why is my heart breaking?

1362
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:43,082
[Eve] Nothing could atone for this.

1363
01:05:43,083 --> 01:05:44,965
Not even your death.

1364
01:05:44,966 --> 01:05:46,175
The suffering you feel is

1365
01:05:46,176 --> 01:05:48,875
the only answer for killing my child.

1366
01:05:48,876 --> 01:05:51,795
[Cain] Mother please, I just, I didn't...

1367
01:05:51,796 --> 01:05:53,495
[Eve] Don't be naive.

1368
01:05:53,496 --> 01:05:56,665
Even if God forgives you, I cannot.

1369
01:05:56,666 --> 01:05:59,685
Cain, I have seen inside your heart.

1370
01:05:59,686 --> 01:06:03,029
And I will not allow you to
kill any more of my children.

1371
01:06:04,094 --> 01:06:07,615
[Rinne Voiceover] This is

1372
01:06:07,616 --> 01:06:09,879
the first murder in human history.

1373
01:06:15,336 --> 01:06:17,305
[Phantoma] And there you have it.

1374
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:20,515
You can no longer hide
behind a veil of ignorance.

1375
01:06:20,516 --> 01:06:24,499
- I mean it's pretty bad!
- (Phantoma scoffs)

1376
01:06:27,179 --> 01:06:28,815
(gasps)

1377
01:06:28,816 --> 01:06:30,207
Rinne?

1378
01:06:30,208 --> 01:06:31,136
Rinne sweetie, is that you?

1379
01:06:31,137 --> 01:06:32,845
Do you have any idea what's happening?

1380
01:06:32,846 --> 01:06:35,095
Where are we, and who
are all these people?

1381
01:06:35,096 --> 01:06:37,005
I'm sure even you can understand

1382
01:06:37,006 --> 01:06:39,065
if your precious mama is here in Hell

1383
01:06:39,066 --> 01:06:40,812
then she must be dead.

1384
01:06:40,813 --> 01:06:41,864
(screams) You can act like

1385
01:06:41,865 --> 01:06:43,545
a good girl all you want,

1386
01:06:43,546 --> 01:06:46,415
but I sure bet you feel
like killing me right now.

1387
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:48,515
Keep up the charade for
as long as you like,

1388
01:06:48,516 --> 01:06:51,568
but deep down you're no
different than a ravenous animal!

1389
01:06:51,569 --> 01:06:53,576
[Mother] Can you at
least tell me where we are?

1390
01:06:53,577 --> 01:06:55,995
[Phantoma] Yes Rinne, tell her!

1391
01:06:55,996 --> 01:06:58,445
Tell her where we are and
how she ended up here!

1392
01:06:58,446 --> 01:06:59,279
Do it!

1393
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,535
[Rinne] She was all that kept me going.

1394
01:07:00,536 --> 01:07:01,536
And you, why?

1395
01:07:03,645 --> 01:07:06,075
Why did you have to kill my mama?

1396
01:07:06,076 --> 01:07:07,395
What, you mean I'm dead?

1397
01:07:07,396 --> 01:07:09,915
How bittersweet it is for in your death

1398
01:07:09,916 --> 01:07:12,075
you may keep your
precious daughter company

1399
01:07:12,076 --> 01:07:13,825
together in the pits of Hell.

1400
01:07:13,826 --> 01:07:14,666
You're lying.

1401
01:07:14,667 --> 01:07:17,155
Oh this decadent pleasure of optimism

1402
01:07:17,156 --> 01:07:20,885
turned to agony and in
such sickening abundance.

1403
01:07:20,886 --> 01:07:22,415
Stupid girl,

1404
01:07:22,416 --> 01:07:24,245
peel away that human skin and you're

1405
01:07:24,246 --> 01:07:26,855
but a bloodthirsty beast just like us!

1406
01:07:26,856 --> 01:07:28,767
The time is finally upon you!

1407
01:07:28,768 --> 01:07:29,975
Chose!

1408
01:07:29,976 --> 01:07:33,285
Settle it once and for
all my dear little Rinne!

1409
01:07:33,286 --> 01:07:34,695
Pass through those gates and

1410
01:07:34,696 --> 01:07:37,445
throw yourself to an eternal nothingness!

1411
01:07:37,446 --> 01:07:39,984
Or stand and fight against me.

1412
01:07:39,985 --> 01:07:42,589
There are no other options.

1413
01:07:43,496 --> 01:07:45,744
(screams)

1414
01:07:45,745 --> 01:07:47,769
I'll never forgive you Phantoma!

1415
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:49,365
(chuckles) That furious expression

1416
01:07:49,366 --> 01:07:51,566
is worth so much more
than your forgiveness.

1417
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:54,652
(shouts)

1418
01:07:56,066 --> 01:07:58,015
How deep does that resolve run?

1419
01:07:58,016 --> 01:07:59,209
Show it to me!

1420
01:08:04,835 --> 01:08:06,108
(screams)

1421
01:08:06,109 --> 01:08:07,975
I could hear that break from here!

1422
01:08:07,976 --> 01:08:10,032
Quit standing around,
we need to help her!

1423
01:08:10,033 --> 01:08:11,239
[Rinne] It's okay.

1424
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:15,339
(laughs)

1425
01:08:18,101 --> 01:08:18,934
[Mother] Rinne.

1426
01:08:18,935 --> 01:08:21,436
[God] The demon is finally
showing us it's true power.

1427
01:08:23,691 --> 01:08:26,359
In that case let's use
the power of God, honey.

1428
01:08:28,416 --> 01:08:30,405
That's the whole reason
I'm here isn't it, God?

1429
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:32,345
To give a helping hand?

1430
01:08:32,346 --> 01:08:33,925
I'll need your power, honey.

1431
01:08:33,926 --> 01:08:35,184
You got this?

1432
01:08:35,185 --> 01:08:36,765
[Rinne] How do I got this?

1433
01:08:36,766 --> 01:08:37,599
Simple hun,

1434
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,829
just believe in my victory
completely and absolutely!

1435
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:44,018
Damn you!

1436
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:45,215
Yeah, I think not.

1437
01:08:45,216 --> 01:08:46,915
If you just believe in yourself honey,

1438
01:08:46,916 --> 01:08:49,665
then the strength of your
desire becomes my power!

1439
01:08:49,666 --> 01:08:50,875
Let me explain.

1440
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:53,065
If honey thinks I might
lose or that I'm no good,

1441
01:08:53,066 --> 01:08:54,505
then my power weakens.

1442
01:08:54,506 --> 01:08:56,165
Since you're the reincarnation of Eve,

1443
01:08:56,166 --> 01:08:57,605
that means you're a part of me.

1444
01:08:57,606 --> 01:08:59,805
Eve's body came from my rib after all!

1445
01:08:59,806 --> 01:09:01,199
God's so awesome!

1446
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,447
- We're two for one!
- I really don't know

1447
01:09:02,448 --> 01:09:03,648
what's going on anymore.

1448
01:09:04,806 --> 01:09:07,765
You bastards are flirting
right in front of me?

1449
01:09:07,766 --> 01:09:09,300
You make me sick!

1450
01:09:09,301 --> 01:09:10,317
[Rinne] Mama!

1451
01:09:10,318 --> 01:09:12,735
(Who laughs)

1452
01:09:14,839 --> 01:09:17,839
(upbeat rock music)

1453
01:09:19,296 --> 01:09:21,546
[Mario] Ah crap, if they
keep going down that slope,

1454
01:09:21,547 --> 01:09:23,499
they'll slide straight into the void!

1455
01:09:26,337 --> 01:09:28,475
[Rinne] Steela!

1456
01:09:28,476 --> 01:09:30,031
[Who] Ah crap!

1457
01:09:30,032 --> 01:09:33,575
(Steela screams)

1458
01:09:33,576 --> 01:09:36,032
(shouts)

1459
01:09:36,033 --> 01:09:41,033
I refuse to die!

1460
01:09:42,986 --> 01:09:44,515
Nice work Phantoma!

1461
01:09:44,516 --> 01:09:46,652
Let go you cowardly bladder skite!

1462
01:09:46,653 --> 01:09:47,596
I'm the coward?

1463
01:09:47,597 --> 01:09:48,991
You brought a monster!

1464
01:09:48,992 --> 01:09:52,612
[Phantoma] Rinne Amagane,
you and me, let's end this!

1465
01:09:52,613 --> 01:09:56,335
Phantoma, do you have
any idea what you're doing?

1466
01:09:56,336 --> 01:09:57,745
You cannot be serious!

1467
01:09:57,746 --> 01:09:59,955
I'm clearly trying to annihilate you,

1468
01:09:59,956 --> 01:10:02,058
and yet you're still
rattling off a lecture?

1469
01:10:02,059 --> 01:10:04,135
That's why I can't stand you!

1470
01:10:04,136 --> 01:10:05,759
You're just a stupid girl!

1471
01:10:06,686 --> 01:10:11,686
Stupid girl, like I was when I was alive.

1472
01:10:12,146 --> 01:10:14,095
I loved a man with all my heart,

1473
01:10:14,096 --> 01:10:16,115
but my best friend loved him too.

1474
01:10:16,116 --> 01:10:18,379
So I let her have him.

1475
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:21,445
But she murdered me simply because

1476
01:10:21,446 --> 01:10:24,423
she suspected that I was
having an affair with him.

1477
01:10:24,424 --> 01:10:28,645
I was a stupid girl for not
being honest about my love,

1478
01:10:28,646 --> 01:10:31,623
and she was too for being
insecure about hers.

1479
01:10:31,624 --> 01:10:34,355
And I lost my life because of it.

1480
01:10:34,356 --> 01:10:38,749
When I fell into Hell, master
Abel understood my pain.

1481
01:10:40,627 --> 01:10:45,627
And so that's why I devote
my entire existence to him!

1482
01:10:46,806 --> 01:10:49,065
That's why he's everything to me!

1483
01:10:49,066 --> 01:10:50,919
Literally no one else matters!

1484
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,925
If nothingness is what he desires,

1485
01:10:52,926 --> 01:10:54,499
then let it all disappear!

1486
01:10:56,145 --> 01:10:58,135
How dare you!

1487
01:10:58,136 --> 01:11:01,065
That only means you have
something you really care about!

1488
01:11:01,066 --> 01:11:02,755
President Kutou is important to you.

1489
01:11:02,756 --> 01:11:05,274
If he's the one that keeps you going,

1490
01:11:05,275 --> 01:11:07,755
that means you still have hope!

1491
01:11:07,756 --> 01:11:10,285
Can't you see that we're the same?

1492
01:11:10,286 --> 01:11:11,985
[Phantoma] We're the same?

1493
01:11:11,986 --> 01:11:13,673
Did you say hope?

1494
01:11:13,674 --> 01:11:15,415
Don't make me laugh.

1495
01:11:15,416 --> 01:11:17,171
Let me give you a little lesson.

1496
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:22,105
Human life, nine parts
suffering, one part happiness.

1497
01:11:22,106 --> 01:11:24,745
A mere 10% of your entire life.

1498
01:11:24,746 --> 01:11:26,635
The best one can hope for.

1499
01:11:26,636 --> 01:11:28,359
President Kutou?

1500
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:30,039
- What happened to you?
- Good lord, just look at you.

1501
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:32,495
- Abel, my dear boy.
- Master Abel.

1502
01:11:32,496 --> 01:11:33,705
That's not right.

1503
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:34,945
You're wrong!

1504
01:11:34,946 --> 01:11:36,829
That's exactly why it matters!

1505
01:11:38,556 --> 01:11:40,245
[Ryu] What are you saying?

1506
01:11:40,246 --> 01:11:42,129
How dare you defy me?

1507
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,251
What is sweet without the sour?

1508
01:11:45,252 --> 01:11:48,519
What is love without a
little bit of heartbreak?

1509
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,035
[Helvis Voiceover] Mother, I see now,

1510
01:11:50,036 --> 01:11:52,715
the strength of your resolve.

1511
01:11:52,716 --> 01:11:54,579
Your feelings and desires.

1512
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:57,025
That may be our only
hope not only for saving

1513
01:11:57,026 --> 01:11:59,315
not only Hell but my brother Abel.

1514
01:11:59,316 --> 01:12:03,205
Maybe life is 90%
suffering and 10% happiness.

1515
01:12:03,206 --> 01:12:06,105
But you can't live a life
of one without the other.

1516
01:12:06,106 --> 01:12:07,365
That means you can embrace the

1517
01:12:07,366 --> 01:12:09,279
happiness you have in your life too!

1518
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:12,325
My happiness?

1519
01:12:12,326 --> 01:12:13,415
That's absurd!

1520
01:12:13,416 --> 01:12:15,345
What is happiness to you then?

1521
01:12:15,346 --> 01:12:16,719
Tell me!

1522
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:19,265
It's all of the little things in life!

1523
01:12:19,266 --> 01:12:21,269
Like making friends and falling in love.

1524
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:27,855
Those are words of someone
who was raised with love.

1525
01:12:27,856 --> 01:12:28,689
Don't you see?

1526
01:12:28,690 --> 01:12:31,415
It's that 10%, the highs after the lows,

1527
01:12:31,416 --> 01:12:33,039
that feel like 100!

1528
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,185
[Ryu] You only say
that because you think

1529
01:12:35,186 --> 01:12:37,355
there's a light at the end of your tunnel.

1530
01:12:37,356 --> 01:12:40,767
But my life ended before I
was given such salvation.

1531
01:12:40,768 --> 01:12:42,925
And here I thought killing your mother

1532
01:12:42,926 --> 01:12:45,805
and dragging her to Hell
would shatter your resolve.

1533
01:12:45,806 --> 01:12:48,879
But it seems like that's
just not enough, is it?

1534
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,689
So let's turn that 90% into 100.

1535
01:12:52,676 --> 01:12:54,669
Phantoma, would you kindly?

1536
01:13:04,706 --> 01:13:08,205
Rinne, never forget that
you're my pride and joy.

1537
01:13:08,206 --> 01:13:11,039
I'm so happy that I brought
you into this world.

1538
01:13:14,736 --> 01:13:18,199
[Ryu] The very definition of despair.

1539
01:13:21,906 --> 01:13:24,656
(Steela screams)

1540
01:13:34,416 --> 01:13:35,716
[Mother] Goodbye, Rinne.

1541
01:13:45,812 --> 01:13:48,175
[God] How impossibly horrid.

1542
01:13:48,176 --> 01:13:50,225
What will you do now, Rinne?

1543
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:51,226
Can you endure?

1544
01:13:53,688 --> 01:13:54,688
Mama.

1545
01:13:56,176 --> 01:13:57,176
Mama!

1546
01:14:01,368 --> 01:14:02,368
Abel!

1547
01:14:04,884 --> 01:14:06,695
No, you're Kutou!

1548
01:14:06,696 --> 01:14:10,675
Get your sadistic ass down
here so I can kick it!

1549
01:14:10,676 --> 01:14:13,265
Stop acting like you're the
only one who's suffered!

1550
01:14:13,266 --> 01:14:14,955
What right do you have inflicting

1551
01:14:14,956 --> 01:14:16,835
this kind of pain on people?

1552
01:14:16,836 --> 01:14:17,776
How can you just stand there

1553
01:14:17,777 --> 01:14:20,605
with that stupid smile on your face?

1554
01:14:20,606 --> 01:14:22,531
You just don't get it, do you?

1555
01:14:22,532 --> 01:14:24,635
I'm helping them,

1556
01:14:24,636 --> 01:14:26,815
showing them the depths
of their suffering.

1557
01:14:26,816 --> 01:14:28,365
And offering a guiding hand

1558
01:14:28,366 --> 01:14:30,889
into a painless land of nothingness.

1559
01:14:34,586 --> 01:14:36,275
Hey, Rinne, wait.

1560
01:14:36,276 --> 01:14:38,126
[Who] Honey, what are you thinking?

1561
01:14:39,246 --> 01:14:42,885
That's right mama, let
your despair wash over you.

1562
01:14:42,886 --> 01:14:44,015
Let it drive you into the

1563
01:14:44,016 --> 01:14:46,455
heart of nothingness that I created.

1564
01:14:46,456 --> 01:14:47,447
Join her.

1565
01:14:47,448 --> 01:14:48,947
I'm coming mama.

1566
01:14:49,871 --> 01:14:50,871
Mama!

1567
01:14:52,266 --> 01:14:53,495
Don't even think about it!

1568
01:14:53,496 --> 01:14:55,365
I've already lost too many
people who are important to me!

1569
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:57,265
And I won't have anything left!

1570
01:14:57,266 --> 01:14:59,491
You can't just go and turn
yourself into nothing!

1571
01:14:59,492 --> 01:15:01,999
I won't lose any more friends, I can't!

1572
01:15:04,155 --> 01:15:05,738
Rinne, don't do it!

1573
01:15:06,844 --> 01:15:07,844
Mama!

1574
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:11,795
(laughs)

1575
01:15:11,796 --> 01:15:13,796
(gasps)

1576
01:15:31,324 --> 01:15:32,657
[Mario] Rinne!

1577
01:15:33,696 --> 01:15:34,779
Damn it, why!

1578
01:15:36,769 --> 01:15:39,055
[Who] That Mario packs a punch.

1579
01:15:39,056 --> 01:15:41,323
He beat Phantoma's
monster with a single hit.

1580
01:15:42,184 --> 01:15:45,111
[Mario Voiceover] Why, why'd you do it?

1581
01:15:45,112 --> 01:15:46,791
How could you?

1582
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:47,792
Rinne?

1583
01:15:49,016 --> 01:15:50,635
[Rinne Voiceover] My mama.

1584
01:15:50,636 --> 01:15:54,155
[Mother] Rinne, never forget
that you're my pride and joy.

1585
01:15:54,156 --> 01:15:57,445
I'm so happy that I brought
you into this world.

1586
01:15:57,446 --> 01:15:59,855
[Rinne Voiceover] She
gave me all of her love,

1587
01:15:59,856 --> 01:16:02,735
and I should have given
her all of mine in return.

1588
01:16:02,736 --> 01:16:05,209
How could I have been so blind?

1589
01:16:06,288 --> 01:16:08,339
I'm so sorry mama.

1590
01:16:09,946 --> 01:16:11,905
I'm such an idiot.

1591
01:16:11,906 --> 01:16:14,689
I'm, who am I?

1592
01:16:14,690 --> 01:16:16,616
Where am I?

1593
01:16:17,816 --> 01:16:20,295
Right, nothingness.

1594
01:16:20,296 --> 01:16:22,189
This is Steela's realm of nothing.

1595
01:16:23,032 --> 01:16:25,383
Wait, nothing?

1596
01:16:25,384 --> 01:16:27,015
But this can't be nothing.

1597
01:16:27,016 --> 01:16:31,919
I'm here, I'm right here,
and I'm not nothing!

1598
01:16:35,996 --> 01:16:40,459
Mama, Rei, Luca, and everyone!

1599
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:42,555
Rinne, thank you.

1600
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:44,725
We could all hear you calling out to us.

1601
01:16:44,726 --> 01:16:46,605
It was your voice that guided me and

1602
01:16:46,606 --> 01:16:48,545
everyone else back from the nothingness,

1603
01:16:48,546 --> 01:16:50,195
and she heard you too.

1604
01:16:50,196 --> 01:16:51,831
[Rinne] Wait, who do you?

1605
01:16:51,832 --> 01:16:53,327
Steela, you're here!

1606
01:16:53,328 --> 01:16:55,995
[Steela] I don't want this.

1607
01:16:55,996 --> 01:16:58,535
I am the nothingness that Abel created.

1608
01:16:58,536 --> 01:17:00,663
But I don't want to be nothing anymore.

1609
01:17:00,664 --> 01:17:03,499
When we first met, I was really scared.

1610
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,915
Scared that I shouldn't exist.

1611
01:17:05,916 --> 01:17:07,585
Yet after everything we went through,

1612
01:17:07,586 --> 01:17:09,865
I thought I want to stay with you,

1613
01:17:09,866 --> 01:17:13,383
even though I can do nothing,
because I am nothing.

1614
01:17:13,384 --> 01:17:16,311
But if you're here Rinne, that means,

1615
01:17:16,312 --> 01:17:18,903
then maybe I should be here too.

1616
01:17:18,904 --> 01:17:20,765
You've been right there by

1617
01:17:20,766 --> 01:17:22,827
my side ever since the beginning,

1618
01:17:22,828 --> 01:17:25,269
and now we can always be together.

1619
01:17:28,681 --> 01:17:33,681
[Steela] Yes, I am not
nothing, I am not alone.

1620
01:17:35,021 --> 01:17:37,609
I am no longer.

1621
01:17:39,432 --> 01:17:40,849
[Ryu] What the?

1622
01:17:45,716 --> 01:17:49,123
[Mario] Oh great, what
the Hell is happening now?

1623
01:17:49,124 --> 01:17:52,631
Wait, what's going on with that light?

1624
01:17:52,632 --> 01:17:53,632
Is that?

1625
01:18:12,482 --> 01:18:14,218
[Rinne] Let's go, Steela.

1626
01:18:14,219 --> 01:18:15,894
[Steela] Okay.

1627
01:18:15,895 --> 01:18:17,233
Why?

1628
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:18,234
How did you?

1629
01:18:19,682 --> 01:18:20,775
You should be dead?

1630
01:18:20,776 --> 01:18:21,985
No!

1631
01:18:21,986 --> 01:18:24,695
Get away from me, what are you?

1632
01:18:24,696 --> 01:18:27,245
It's me silly, your pal Rinne.

1633
01:18:27,246 --> 01:18:29,495
Pull yourself together girl, come on!

1634
01:18:29,496 --> 01:18:31,098
You have a date with Kutou, don't you?

1635
01:18:31,099 --> 01:18:32,488
[Phantoma] A date, what
are you talking about?

1636
01:18:32,489 --> 01:18:34,125
Aww, don't be like that!

1637
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:36,149
It'll go totally fine, I swear.

1638
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:38,239
[Steela] A date with president Kutou.

1639
01:18:40,235 --> 01:18:42,402
(shrieks)

1640
01:18:43,306 --> 01:18:45,639
(Ryu roars)

1641
01:18:46,905 --> 01:18:47,905
[Ryu] Why?

1642
01:18:50,377 --> 01:18:52,025
[Who] Oh, it's salty.

1643
01:18:52,026 --> 01:18:52,859
Really honey,

1644
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:55,156
you made an ocean in the
middle of Abel's Hell?

1645
01:18:56,077 --> 01:18:58,327
(chuckles)

1646
01:18:59,426 --> 01:19:00,546
Whoa, look at Phantoma go.

1647
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:02,744
Rinne!

1648
01:19:02,745 --> 01:19:04,379
It's you, it's really you.

1649
01:19:05,656 --> 01:19:08,065
- I can't breathe!
- You moron, I swear,

1650
01:19:08,066 --> 01:19:08,906
I'm never gonna let you do

1651
01:19:08,907 --> 01:19:11,415
something stupid like that ever again.

1652
01:19:11,416 --> 01:19:13,435
Yo, that's my wife.

1653
01:19:13,436 --> 01:19:14,495
Past life wife.

1654
01:19:14,496 --> 01:19:15,696
[Voices] Mario, Mario!

1655
01:19:17,579 --> 01:19:19,935
This jerk, he's already forgot about us.

1656
01:19:19,936 --> 01:19:22,922
No I didn't, I thought Steela
ate you guys or something.

1657
01:19:22,923 --> 01:19:25,325
Not quite, but here
we are, safe and sound.

1658
01:19:25,326 --> 01:19:26,975
And it's not just us who's back.

1659
01:19:26,976 --> 01:19:28,339
Everyone, please look!

1660
01:19:29,396 --> 01:19:32,639
Wait, hang on, that's impossible, right?

1661
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:40,485
They're all alive?

1662
01:19:40,486 --> 01:19:42,115
How can they still exist?

1663
01:19:42,116 --> 01:19:44,458
Mama's unwavering
persistence is no surprise,

1664
01:19:44,459 --> 01:19:46,159
but this is impossible!

1665
01:19:51,794 --> 01:19:53,211
I am so judged!

1666
01:19:55,356 --> 01:19:57,989
It's making my heart beat like thunder!

1667
01:19:57,990 --> 01:19:59,429
[God] Impressive.

1668
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:03,815
Her power is more vast than I
could have possibly imagined.

1669
01:20:03,816 --> 01:20:05,425
Wasn't your arm broken before?

1670
01:20:05,426 --> 01:20:06,575
Is it okay now?

1671
01:20:06,576 --> 01:20:08,593
Yeah, I believed that it'd be fine,

1672
01:20:08,594 --> 01:20:11,375
and I think my belief healed it.

1673
01:20:11,376 --> 01:20:13,115
Maybe that's how we came back,

1674
01:20:13,116 --> 01:20:15,895
because I refused to
believe in the nothingness.

1675
01:20:15,896 --> 01:20:19,395
Rather I wished that
we existed, so we did.

1676
01:20:19,396 --> 01:20:21,765
Yeah, reality doesn't
exactly work that way.

1677
01:20:21,766 --> 01:20:23,595
You just felt like it then.

1678
01:20:23,596 --> 01:20:26,265
What, are you telling me that
if I just believe hard enough,

1679
01:20:26,266 --> 01:20:27,995
my arm will suddenly come back?

1680
01:20:27,996 --> 01:20:29,015
[Who] Right on the money.

1681
01:20:29,016 --> 01:20:31,995
Come on Mario, you've
literally seen it first hand.

1682
01:20:31,996 --> 01:20:33,115
How else do you think you beat

1683
01:20:33,116 --> 01:20:35,155
Phantoma's monster with just one hit?

1684
01:20:35,156 --> 01:20:36,805
That was probably just a fluke.

1685
01:20:36,806 --> 01:20:37,885
In the heat of the moment,

1686
01:20:37,886 --> 01:20:39,805
the only thought going
through your mind was that

1687
01:20:39,806 --> 01:20:41,953
you would absolutely destroy that monster.

1688
01:20:41,954 --> 01:20:44,605
You believed it so that you could do it.

1689
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:47,953
That means there's just
one thing we have to do.

1690
01:20:47,954 --> 01:20:50,218
If we want out of this literal Hell hole,

1691
01:20:50,219 --> 01:20:52,335
we got to want it!

1692
01:20:52,336 --> 01:20:54,225
Just because you believe real hard

1693
01:20:54,226 --> 01:20:56,218
doesn't mean it'll change anything.

1694
01:20:56,219 --> 01:21:00,602
Huh? (rumbling)

1695
01:21:13,716 --> 01:21:16,033
Imagine it, then create it!

1696
01:21:17,076 --> 01:21:19,145
Believe without a doubt!

1697
01:21:19,146 --> 01:21:20,665
It's only through belief that

1698
01:21:20,666 --> 01:21:22,216
we're able to change the world!

1699
01:21:30,236 --> 01:21:33,349
[Mario Voiceover] Imagine, to create.

1700
01:21:44,651 --> 01:21:46,901
(cheering)

1701
01:22:02,911 --> 01:22:06,485
[Ryu] Incredibly, I just
can't keep up with you, mama.

1702
01:22:06,486 --> 01:22:07,709
- Well, it's fine.
- That voice.

1703
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:08,715
[Rinne] President Kutou.

1704
01:22:08,716 --> 01:22:10,075
[Ryu] I had planned to erase all of you.

1705
01:22:10,076 --> 01:22:13,395
Instead I'll offer a chance
to return to your suffering.

1706
01:22:13,396 --> 01:22:15,849
But just letting you
go wouldn't be any fun.

1707
01:22:16,966 --> 01:22:19,015
Instead why don't we play a game of fate?

1708
01:22:19,016 --> 01:22:20,245
So what, more volleyball?

1709
01:22:20,246 --> 01:22:22,169
I actually prefer basketball.

1710
01:22:23,096 --> 01:22:24,535
[Ryu] That orb you see in front of you

1711
01:22:24,536 --> 01:22:27,715
is a manifestation of
your will and spirit.

1712
01:22:27,716 --> 01:22:30,265
You have those, in case you've forgotten.

1713
01:22:30,266 --> 01:22:32,535
If you can get your orb into that goal

1714
01:22:32,536 --> 01:22:34,772
I will allow you to return to life.

1715
01:22:34,773 --> 01:22:36,628
[Man] And what if we fail, what then?

1716
01:22:36,629 --> 01:22:38,412
Then you will remain here,

1717
01:22:38,413 --> 01:22:40,063
and I will destroy you
along with the rest of

1718
01:22:40,064 --> 01:22:42,945
this pitiful world with my own two hands!

1719
01:22:42,946 --> 01:22:44,265
Now make your choice!

1720
01:22:44,266 --> 01:22:45,999
Destruction, or resurrection!

1721
01:22:52,045 --> 01:22:55,315
Oh, bravo mama.

1722
01:22:55,316 --> 01:22:57,150
Your turn, president Kutou.

1723
01:22:57,151 --> 01:23:00,119
So we can return to life, together!

1724
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:02,203
(growls)

1725
01:23:04,201 --> 01:23:06,145
What are the rest of you waiting for?

1726
01:23:06,146 --> 01:23:07,209
Quite stalling!

1727
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,155
I can't.

1728
01:23:10,156 --> 01:23:11,615
It's impossible.

1729
01:23:11,616 --> 01:23:13,235
[Man] Yeah, I'm good.

1730
01:23:13,236 --> 01:23:14,671
[Man] There's no way I can make it.

1731
01:23:14,672 --> 01:23:16,062
[Woman] It's too much.

1732
01:23:16,063 --> 01:23:18,485
You dumb bastards, we have to!

1733
01:23:18,486 --> 01:23:19,991
There's no other way!

1734
01:23:19,992 --> 01:23:22,285
You make it, you get your life back.

1735
01:23:22,286 --> 01:23:24,045
What other choice is there?

1736
01:23:24,046 --> 01:23:25,405
I'll just go first and show

1737
01:23:25,406 --> 01:23:27,156
the rest of you guys how it's done.

1738
01:23:28,346 --> 01:23:29,996
[Mario Voiceover] Do it, Mario.

1739
01:23:31,133 --> 01:23:36,133
I'll do it, I'll throw it, I'm doing it!

1740
01:23:36,942 --> 01:23:38,942
[Goal] Uh, you missed.

1741
01:23:49,996 --> 01:23:53,515
Wait, Mario, your hand, it's fading!

1742
01:23:53,516 --> 01:23:55,185
Hey arm, who said you
could disappear on me?

1743
01:23:55,186 --> 01:23:57,285
I got to lead the way for these guys.

1744
01:23:57,286 --> 01:23:59,982
You can try to lead these
ignoble masses all you want,

1745
01:23:59,983 --> 01:24:01,875
but it won't change anything.

1746
01:24:01,876 --> 01:24:05,405
Seeing as I control the
fate of this entire world!

1747
01:24:05,406 --> 01:24:07,855
Wishing? Believing?

1748
01:24:07,856 --> 01:24:11,411
Those along won't be enough
with your fragile ideals, Mario.

1749
01:24:11,412 --> 01:24:14,655
The world can only do so much.

1750
01:24:14,656 --> 01:24:16,785
It's one way or the other.

1751
01:24:16,786 --> 01:24:19,619
If you think that your
will can change this world,

1752
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:22,076
then I can do the same!

1753
01:24:22,077 --> 01:24:23,895
Understand?

1754
01:24:23,896 --> 01:24:27,715
The strength of one's wish
is what controls everything.

1755
01:24:27,716 --> 01:24:30,119
That is wishing, that is believing!

1756
01:24:31,437 --> 01:24:34,339
And this is only the beginning.

1757
01:24:36,057 --> 01:24:39,125
That jump was insane, how did you?

1758
01:24:39,126 --> 01:24:41,525
This is why you will fail, Mario.

1759
01:24:41,526 --> 01:24:43,512
It's your beliefs versus mine.

1760
01:24:43,513 --> 01:24:45,927
And in a world where
one's wishes become real,

1761
01:24:45,928 --> 01:24:48,345
none of you have the power to shape it.

1762
01:24:48,346 --> 01:24:50,415
This is my reality.

1763
01:24:50,416 --> 01:24:52,355
Anybody can simply sit back and

1764
01:24:52,356 --> 01:24:54,635
hope for their dreams to come true.

1765
01:24:54,636 --> 01:24:56,605
But actually working to realize

1766
01:24:56,606 --> 01:24:58,615
those dreams can be soul crushing.

1767
01:24:58,616 --> 01:25:01,859
Your resolve wavers and that's
where it all falls apart!

1768
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:05,405
You work and you study
chasing after your dreams,

1769
01:25:05,406 --> 01:25:07,649
but so does everyone else!

1770
01:25:07,650 --> 01:25:10,515
You cannot share first place.

1771
01:25:10,516 --> 01:25:14,825
The truth of it is there
are winners and losers.

1772
01:25:14,826 --> 01:25:17,375
In other words you can
try as hard as you want,

1773
01:25:17,376 --> 01:25:18,899
and still get nothing!

1774
01:25:28,932 --> 01:25:30,875
It appears you've somehow
convinced yourself

1775
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:32,921
that these rules don't apply to you.

1776
01:25:32,922 --> 01:25:35,295
But you aren't special!

1777
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:36,129
You know,

1778
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:38,415
I can't remember how long I've
been sitting here by myself,

1779
01:25:38,416 --> 01:25:40,355
rotting away like some kind of zombie.

1780
01:25:40,356 --> 01:25:43,849
But then one day I met you,
and everything changed.

1781
01:25:44,746 --> 01:25:47,225
After I lost my mind, my will to leave,

1782
01:25:47,226 --> 01:25:48,775
all that I had to this place,

1783
01:25:48,776 --> 01:25:52,255
it was you who saved me,
you saved me from myself.

1784
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:53,089
You told me that it was Helvis,

1785
01:25:53,090 --> 01:25:55,155
and that he was the one responsible

1786
01:25:55,156 --> 01:25:56,795
for breaking the cycle of rebirth!

1787
01:25:56,796 --> 01:25:58,975
You said that defeating him
would set things straight!

1788
01:25:58,976 --> 01:26:00,265
You told me that was the only way

1789
01:26:00,266 --> 01:26:02,705
we could save ourselves
from this endless Hell!

1790
01:26:02,706 --> 01:26:04,875
I learned about everything from you.

1791
01:26:04,876 --> 01:26:07,105
Humanity's beginning, the murder,

1792
01:26:07,106 --> 01:26:09,079
the brothers and their feud.

1793
01:26:09,962 --> 01:26:11,735
I thought that we could finally go home,

1794
01:26:11,736 --> 01:26:14,355
that we could get their together.

1795
01:26:14,356 --> 01:26:15,745
And then you betrayed us.

1796
01:26:15,746 --> 01:26:19,625
It was a necessity,
your power, friendship.

1797
01:26:19,626 --> 01:26:22,425
In a way, I did need you all.

1798
01:26:22,426 --> 01:26:24,085
You call that friendship?

1799
01:26:24,086 --> 01:26:27,005
What a joke, we were just
tools to you, weren't we?

1800
01:26:27,006 --> 01:26:29,695
You used the student council
to suit your own needs.

1801
01:26:29,696 --> 01:26:31,795
That's not friendship.

1802
01:26:31,796 --> 01:26:33,765
It was just a lie, all of it.

1803
01:26:33,766 --> 01:26:36,199
I can't believe I trusted you, bastard!

1804
01:26:37,466 --> 01:26:38,719
Where's your humanity!

1805
01:26:39,979 --> 01:26:42,345
Dependency and disloyalty.

1806
01:26:42,346 --> 01:26:44,558
There's nothing more human, Mario.

1807
01:26:44,559 --> 01:26:46,603
Just accept it.

1808
01:26:46,604 --> 01:26:50,525
Living pointless lives,
reaching for significance,

1809
01:26:50,526 --> 01:26:52,626
and dying in obscurity.

1810
01:26:52,627 --> 01:26:55,855
Being human is just a futile struggle.

1811
01:26:55,856 --> 01:26:56,856
It's meaningless.

1812
01:26:58,927 --> 01:27:00,427
Shut your mouth!

1813
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,865
What kind of a wish is that?

1814
01:27:06,866 --> 01:27:08,965
Hatred is an unrivaled emotion,

1815
01:27:08,966 --> 01:27:10,755
strong enough to grant you that arm,

1816
01:27:10,756 --> 01:27:12,745
all for the sake of striking me.

1817
01:27:12,746 --> 01:27:14,395
Dress it up however you like,

1818
01:27:14,396 --> 01:27:17,525
but humanity's strength lies
beneath a wretched heart.

1819
01:27:17,526 --> 01:27:18,359
So what could drive you
to waste that strength

1820
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:20,585
- on these fools?
- Shut up!

1821
01:27:20,586 --> 01:27:22,875
Every single thing you
say just pisses me off!

1822
01:27:22,876 --> 01:27:23,836
But more than anything,

1823
01:27:23,837 --> 01:27:25,865
I'm angry at myself
for ever believing you!

1824
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:27,405
And now even after I realize

1825
01:27:27,406 --> 01:27:29,395
how stupid I've been this entire time,

1826
01:27:29,396 --> 01:27:31,025
it's all too God damn late!

1827
01:27:31,026 --> 01:27:32,955
It's never too late, Mario.

1828
01:27:32,956 --> 01:27:33,789
Right?

1829
01:27:33,789 --> 01:27:34,622
[Mario] Rinne?

1830
01:27:34,623 --> 01:27:36,055
This look doesn't suit you.

1831
01:27:36,056 --> 01:27:38,369
I think you could use
a helping hand buddy.

1832
01:27:43,536 --> 01:27:46,475
[Mario] This temper
tantrum of yours ends here.

1833
01:27:46,476 --> 01:27:48,435
[Ryu] Oh, is that right?

1834
01:27:48,436 --> 01:27:49,735
That brick wall you've been

1835
01:27:49,736 --> 01:27:52,885
banging your head against
remains unscathed.

1836
01:27:52,886 --> 01:27:56,349
You've already exemplified
humanity's insignificance.

1837
01:27:56,350 --> 01:27:58,190
So what now?

1838
01:27:58,191 --> 01:28:00,155
[Mario Voiceover] What do I have?

1839
01:28:00,156 --> 01:28:05,156
Is there anything?

1840
01:28:06,009 --> 01:28:11,009
Kutou!

1841
01:28:21,636 --> 01:28:23,149
Stop this now, dummy.

1842
01:28:25,696 --> 01:28:26,696
Yo.

1843
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:31,401
You dumb ass!

1844
01:28:31,402 --> 01:28:32,695
How's that?

1845
01:28:32,696 --> 01:28:33,696
Hurts, right?

1846
01:28:35,184 --> 01:28:36,395
(groans)

1847
01:28:36,396 --> 01:28:38,855
[Ryu] Pain is nothing
more than weakness.

1848
01:28:38,856 --> 01:28:41,155
Bull shit, you God damn liar!

1849
01:28:41,156 --> 01:28:43,045
Tell the Kutou I know deep inside

1850
01:28:43,046 --> 01:28:44,475
that it's time to wake up!

1851
01:28:44,476 --> 01:28:45,965
Can't, that part is gone.

1852
01:28:45,966 --> 01:28:47,215
Damn you!

1853
01:28:47,216 --> 01:28:49,285
I could die from this suffering.

1854
01:28:49,286 --> 01:28:50,745
I know you're hurting too,

1855
01:28:50,746 --> 01:28:52,365
but my pain is unbearable.

1856
01:28:52,366 --> 01:28:54,119
It's a billion times worse!

1857
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,335
I don't know why,

1858
01:28:55,336 --> 01:28:58,025
but my heart feels like
it's breaking apart!

1859
01:28:58,026 --> 01:28:59,769
So shut the hell up!

1860
01:29:02,556 --> 01:29:04,645
[Who Voiceover] Abel, you're in luck.

1861
01:29:04,646 --> 01:29:06,439
You found yourself a true friend.

1862
01:29:08,266 --> 01:29:11,095
Go on, keep playing your twisted game.

1863
01:29:11,096 --> 01:29:12,365
As far as your rules,

1864
01:29:12,366 --> 01:29:14,095
you seem to think they can't be changed.

1865
01:29:14,096 --> 01:29:16,775
But I've got one hell
of a surprise for you.

1866
01:29:16,776 --> 01:29:18,726
You better brace yourselves, get ready!

1867
01:29:28,176 --> 01:29:30,042
I'm sick and tired of all of Abel's rules.

1868
01:29:30,043 --> 01:29:32,375
The only thing we can do
is make our own rules,

1869
01:29:32,376 --> 01:29:34,165
and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

1870
01:29:34,166 --> 01:29:35,315
So if you want to go home,

1871
01:29:35,316 --> 01:29:38,371
here's a guaranteed shot
that you can't possibly miss!

1872
01:29:38,372 --> 01:29:39,299
No go for it!

1873
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:41,355
That's it, just throw it?

1874
01:29:41,356 --> 01:29:42,655
Seriously?

1875
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:44,015
He's holding.

1876
01:29:44,016 --> 01:29:46,945
Come on you punks, let's
have ourselves a ball!

1877
01:29:46,946 --> 01:29:49,079
We'll teach our friend Abel here a lesson.

1878
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:50,080
Throw it in!

1879
01:29:52,728 --> 01:29:54,978
(groaning)

1880
01:30:04,351 --> 01:30:06,988
Why does it suddenly feel
like the tides have turned?

1881
01:30:06,989 --> 01:30:09,584
That's right, good job everyone!

1882
01:30:09,585 --> 01:30:11,551
[Crowd] Let's go, let's
go, let's go, let's go!

1883
01:30:11,552 --> 01:30:12,752
Don't get ahead of yourself!

1884
01:30:17,186 --> 01:30:19,025
Why, what's this feeling?

1885
01:30:19,026 --> 01:30:20,959
What is happening inside of my heart?

1886
01:30:23,404 --> 01:30:25,285
[Mario] Damn it was pointless.

1887
01:30:25,286 --> 01:30:27,165
This thing was never gonna take
us back to the living world,

1888
01:30:27,166 --> 01:30:28,731
was it?

1889
01:30:28,732 --> 01:30:30,992
[Ryu] Since you've forced
me to taste this agony,

1890
01:30:30,993 --> 01:30:32,500
I'll see to your demise.

1891
01:30:32,501 --> 01:30:34,334
Fare thee well, Mario.

1892
01:30:35,846 --> 01:30:36,891
Fare me well?

1893
01:30:36,892 --> 01:30:38,399
Go fair yourself.

1894
01:30:41,106 --> 01:30:42,825
[Mario Voiceover] Oh man,
is this really the end?

1895
01:30:42,826 --> 01:30:44,435
It is, isn't it?

1896
01:30:44,436 --> 01:30:45,269
Damn it!

1897
01:30:45,270 --> 01:30:47,511
[Rinne] You can't just give up!

1898
01:30:47,512 --> 01:30:48,858
What, who's that?

1899
01:30:48,859 --> 01:30:50,972
Mario you big dummy!

1900
01:30:50,973 --> 01:30:53,463
You absolutely can't give up!

1901
01:30:53,464 --> 01:30:55,714
(cheering)

1902
01:30:57,326 --> 01:30:59,245
That girl worries me to death.

1903
01:30:59,246 --> 01:31:00,345
She's so reckless.

1904
01:31:00,346 --> 01:31:01,336
It's fine.

1905
01:31:01,337 --> 01:31:03,303
There's nothing to worry about, mom.

1906
01:31:03,304 --> 01:31:06,305
She found the strength to
not only protect herself,

1907
01:31:06,306 --> 01:31:08,005
but others as well.

1908
01:31:08,006 --> 01:31:09,783
Also she's my way way...

1909
01:31:09,784 --> 01:31:12,059
[Mother] Way past wife, is that it?

1910
01:31:14,013 --> 01:31:15,635
(heartbeat)

1911
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:18,725
(groans in pain)

1912
01:31:18,726 --> 01:31:20,745
Who lectured me before about needing to

1913
01:31:20,746 --> 01:31:23,635
protect myself before
trying to save others?

1914
01:31:23,636 --> 01:31:27,235
I didn't really understand it
back then, but I get it now.

1915
01:31:27,236 --> 01:31:28,455
Same here.

1916
01:31:28,456 --> 01:31:30,385
I think I finally figured it out too.

1917
01:31:30,386 --> 01:31:32,335
I'm sorry that I made
you guys worry so much,

1918
01:31:32,336 --> 01:31:33,555
but I think my recklessness

1919
01:31:33,556 --> 01:31:35,223
might have taught me something else.

1920
01:31:35,224 --> 01:31:38,125
You're the one who told
me to never give up,

1921
01:31:38,126 --> 01:31:39,738
and that's when I realized how

1922
01:31:39,739 --> 01:31:41,739
we can change this Hell of Abel's.

1923
01:31:43,014 --> 01:31:46,135
But Rinne, you already knew that.

1924
01:31:46,136 --> 01:31:47,195
Yep!

1925
01:31:47,196 --> 01:31:48,835
But if we want to make things happen,

1926
01:31:48,836 --> 01:31:52,325
we have to work together,
with everyone's feelings.

1927
01:31:52,326 --> 01:31:54,035
[Mario] Yeah, so come on guys!

1928
01:31:54,036 --> 01:31:56,636
[Group] Let's all go home!

1929
01:31:56,637 --> 01:31:58,251
[Steela] Yeah.

1930
01:31:58,252 --> 01:32:00,315
(laughs weakly)

1931
01:32:00,316 --> 01:32:03,205
So, miss Rinne, before we celebrate,

1932
01:32:03,206 --> 01:32:04,645
how do we escape Hell?

1933
01:32:04,646 --> 01:32:06,355
Well it's all a matter of realizing that

1934
01:32:06,356 --> 01:32:07,885
Hell was never real in the first place.

1935
01:32:07,886 --> 01:32:10,135
Oh right, 'cause what
the here is all this?

1936
01:32:10,136 --> 01:32:13,336
[Mario] This entire place is
just Abel's imaginary world.

1937
01:32:13,337 --> 01:32:15,755
[Pandaz] His imaginary world?

1938
01:32:15,756 --> 01:32:16,726
That's right.

1939
01:32:16,727 --> 01:32:19,445
Just look back at what's happened so far.

1940
01:32:19,446 --> 01:32:22,545
The nothingness is gone,
Rinne created an ocean,

1941
01:32:22,546 --> 01:32:25,335
and through sheer willpower
I even got my arm back.

1942
01:32:25,336 --> 01:32:26,735
Well I've got to hand it to ya.

1943
01:32:26,736 --> 01:32:28,755
[Mario] It's all because
we escaped from Abel's,

1944
01:32:28,756 --> 01:32:31,425
I mean Kutou's, imagination,
which had us trapped.

1945
01:32:31,426 --> 01:32:33,879
But in truth we were
just being controlled.

1946
01:32:35,045 --> 01:32:38,485
The place we call Hell never
really existed to begin with,

1947
01:32:38,486 --> 01:32:40,035
it was all an illusion.

1948
01:32:40,036 --> 01:32:41,445
But we're all dead?

1949
01:32:41,446 --> 01:32:43,598
I think it's common knowledge
that when somebody dies,

1950
01:32:43,599 --> 01:32:45,395
they go to Heaven or Hell.

1951
01:32:45,396 --> 01:32:47,265
[God] Common knowledge, huh?

1952
01:32:47,266 --> 01:32:51,035
How is it that human beings
could conceive Heaven or Hell

1953
01:32:51,036 --> 01:32:52,955
if they've never even seen it?

1954
01:32:52,956 --> 01:32:55,675
How do they come to
accept the concept of Hell

1955
01:32:55,676 --> 01:32:57,735
if they've never even been there?

1956
01:32:57,736 --> 01:33:01,425
It's because Abel has sown
these insidious images

1957
01:33:01,426 --> 01:33:04,399
into the art and religion
of the living world.

1958
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,025
[Everyone] Huh?

1959
01:33:06,026 --> 01:33:08,725
[Mario] So we swayed by
the seeds of Abel's madness.

1960
01:33:08,726 --> 01:33:09,939
At least until today.

1961
01:33:11,456 --> 01:33:13,619
[Ryu] Mario, damn you!

1962
01:33:14,916 --> 01:33:18,049
Curse me all you want, but
your fake suffering ends here!

1963
01:33:19,683 --> 01:33:22,595
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

1964
01:33:22,596 --> 01:33:26,406
[Everyone] Being human means
we can live our own lives!

1965
01:33:28,687 --> 01:33:31,104
And make our own decisions!

1966
01:33:35,626 --> 01:33:38,135
We really did it, I can't believe it!

1967
01:33:38,136 --> 01:33:39,839
Hell is finally gone!

1968
01:33:42,817 --> 01:33:45,505
But how are we supposed
to get back home now?

1969
01:33:45,506 --> 01:33:47,622
Huh, the living world?

1970
01:33:47,623 --> 01:33:48,829
Was it here all along?

1971
01:33:49,906 --> 01:33:50,906
We can go back!

1972
01:33:53,384 --> 01:33:54,665
(sobbing)

1973
01:33:54,666 --> 01:33:57,675
It's right there, so why can't I go home?

1974
01:33:57,676 --> 01:33:59,559
You can, Luca.

1975
01:34:00,956 --> 01:34:05,081
Like this!

1976
01:34:05,082 --> 01:34:07,582
(gasps)

1977
01:34:07,583 --> 01:34:10,750
(upbeat bright music)

1978
01:34:14,349 --> 01:34:16,505
(laughs)

1979
01:34:16,506 --> 01:34:18,745
Everyone, look to the sky!

1980
01:34:18,746 --> 01:34:20,125
It's the living world!

1981
01:34:20,126 --> 01:34:21,935
Come on, let's go!

1982
01:34:21,936 --> 01:34:23,345
[Mario] Rinne.

1983
01:34:23,346 --> 01:34:24,825
So did that clumsy caterpillar

1984
01:34:24,826 --> 01:34:27,485
just become a beautiful butterfly?

1985
01:34:27,486 --> 01:34:29,445
No, not quite.

1986
01:34:29,446 --> 01:34:30,649
That's no butterfly.

1987
01:34:34,509 --> 01:34:35,342
I see them!

1988
01:34:35,343 --> 01:34:37,105
Rinne has the wings of an angel!

1989
01:34:37,106 --> 01:34:38,106
Just look!

1990
01:34:39,016 --> 01:34:40,559
You're my angel!

1991
01:34:41,502 --> 01:34:42,941
Let's go too guys!

1992
01:34:42,942 --> 01:34:45,525
We'll go together with Rinne!

1993
01:34:48,243 --> 01:34:50,085
[Rinne Voiceover]
Now we can all go home.

1994
01:34:50,086 --> 01:34:51,679
Everyone, together.

1995
01:34:53,216 --> 01:34:54,223
Wait, Kutou.

1996
01:34:56,499 --> 01:34:58,829
Why is he smiling?

1997
01:34:59,786 --> 01:35:01,761
- I'm scared!
- I'm so high up!

1998
01:35:01,762 --> 01:35:04,262
Everyone, you can't give up!

1999
01:35:05,214 --> 01:35:06,835
No!

2000
01:35:06,836 --> 01:35:10,545
Self doubt is a millstone
around the neck of every man.

2001
01:35:10,546 --> 01:35:11,546
You idiots!

2002
01:35:16,437 --> 01:35:18,425
We just got through wiping out Hell,

2003
01:35:18,426 --> 01:35:20,035
and told Abel where he can stick it.

2004
01:35:20,036 --> 01:35:21,985
So don't act like this crap can beat you!

2005
01:35:21,986 --> 01:35:23,842
You've got to believe in yourselves!

2006
01:35:23,843 --> 01:35:25,365
Yo Pandaz, come on.

2007
01:35:25,366 --> 01:35:26,985
You're the best hype man I know.

2008
01:35:26,986 --> 01:35:28,236
So tell them what's what!

2009
01:35:29,546 --> 01:35:31,133
[Pandaz] I can't.

2010
01:35:31,134 --> 01:35:33,217
(growls)

2011
01:35:39,154 --> 01:35:41,737
- That's crazy.
- It's too much.

2012
01:35:42,746 --> 01:35:45,079
(muttering)

2013
01:35:49,569 --> 01:35:50,633
Huh?

2014
01:35:50,634 --> 01:35:55,595
Kutou, what did you do to them?

2015
01:35:55,596 --> 01:35:58,259
[Rinne] These are.

2016
01:36:00,130 --> 01:36:01,836
What the Hell is that?

2017
01:36:03,925 --> 01:36:06,815
Kutou, you did this, didn't you?

2018
01:36:06,816 --> 01:36:09,158
You're finally catching on, Mario.

2019
01:36:09,159 --> 01:36:12,595
I think it's just about
time for the grand finale.

2020
01:36:12,596 --> 01:36:15,279
Ladies, it's been a real pleasure.

2021
01:36:30,699 --> 01:36:32,949
They're all transforming.

2022
01:36:35,317 --> 01:36:37,685
[Ryu] Witness the beginning of the end!

2023
01:36:37,686 --> 01:36:39,855
In this world hope and despair

2024
01:36:39,856 --> 01:36:42,755
control the very fabric of it's reality!

2025
01:36:42,756 --> 01:36:45,495
Your own sins have given
birth to self doubt,

2026
01:36:45,496 --> 01:36:47,775
and that same doubt is what feeds them!

2027
01:36:47,776 --> 01:36:50,205
Complacency will be your downfall!

2028
01:36:50,206 --> 01:36:52,095
Your very nature betrays you!

2029
01:36:52,096 --> 01:36:54,865
Leading to a fitting end
for such pathetic creatures

2030
01:36:54,866 --> 01:36:57,166
that are completely
consumed by their own sin!

2031
01:36:58,933 --> 01:36:59,977
(screams)

2032
01:36:59,978 --> 01:37:01,935
Let go of me!

2033
01:37:01,936 --> 01:37:03,105
Stop this!

2034
01:37:03,106 --> 01:37:04,495
What are you doing?

2035
01:37:04,496 --> 01:37:07,085
Are simply trying to
atone for murdering me?

2036
01:37:07,086 --> 01:37:09,549
Or is it just because I'm
you're little brother?

2037
01:37:17,646 --> 01:37:19,979
(screaming)

2038
01:37:24,698 --> 01:37:26,137
(yells)

2039
01:37:26,138 --> 01:37:27,445
Rokku, hey!

2040
01:37:27,446 --> 01:37:29,977
Hey guys, if he fell down there, then.

2041
01:37:29,978 --> 01:37:31,065
[Rei] Seriously?

2042
01:37:31,066 --> 01:37:32,978
If Rokku's supposed to
be God, then how did he?

2043
01:37:32,979 --> 01:37:35,780
So what in the Hell is gonna happen now?

2044
01:37:35,781 --> 01:37:39,140
Headmaster Helvis, Rokku,
I mean God has fallen!

2045
01:37:39,141 --> 01:37:39,974
What now?

2046
01:37:39,975 --> 01:37:41,659
I honestly have no idea.

2047
01:37:42,594 --> 01:37:43,855
(chuckles)

2048
01:37:43,856 --> 01:37:46,269
God is dead and salvation is for naught.

2049
01:37:48,306 --> 01:37:49,306
Steela!

2050
01:37:54,032 --> 01:37:55,032
Good job.

2051
01:37:56,284 --> 01:37:58,201
Let's go home together.

2052
01:38:00,938 --> 01:38:01,938
Rinne.

2053
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:04,645
[Mario Voiceover] Hang in there, 'kay?

2054
01:38:04,646 --> 01:38:06,145
You got this.

2055
01:38:06,146 --> 01:38:08,569
We have all the ammo we need.

2056
01:38:08,570 --> 01:38:10,737
(screams)

2057
01:38:17,355 --> 01:38:21,438
[Woman] That's it, you've
got to think positive!

2058
01:38:28,396 --> 01:38:29,755
[Ryu] Take a look, Cain.

2059
01:38:29,756 --> 01:38:31,969
Humans really are hopeless.

2060
01:38:32,812 --> 01:38:35,335
Lost in their delusions.

2061
01:38:35,336 --> 01:38:38,716
Forever inviting disaster upon themselves.

2062
01:38:44,006 --> 01:38:45,783
You're a fool, Abel.

2063
01:38:45,784 --> 01:38:47,035
If only you could understand

2064
01:38:47,036 --> 01:38:49,105
that this world is ours to shape.

2065
01:38:49,106 --> 01:38:50,865
If we just believe and work together,

2066
01:38:50,866 --> 01:38:53,555
no obstacle could
possibly stand in our way.

2067
01:38:53,556 --> 01:38:57,622
Brother, you must never abandon hope!

2068
01:38:57,623 --> 01:38:59,225
[Ryu] And why would I?

2069
01:38:59,226 --> 01:39:01,415
It's everything I hoped for.

2070
01:39:01,416 --> 01:39:04,049
I got exactly what I wanted, Cain.

2071
01:39:07,731 --> 01:39:09,669
And with this, it ends.

2072
01:39:10,556 --> 01:39:14,265
Here in my final moments I
have but one single regret.

2073
01:39:14,266 --> 01:39:15,755
That I may never witness the

2074
01:39:15,756 --> 01:39:18,709
inevitable extinction of humanity.

2075
01:39:25,526 --> 01:39:27,815
Damn it, why did I,

2076
01:39:27,816 --> 01:39:30,205
why the Hell did my body move on it's own?

2077
01:39:30,206 --> 01:39:31,859
Stop, please don't!

2078
01:39:32,856 --> 01:39:35,273
Why, no, I don't want to die!

2079
01:39:37,276 --> 01:39:40,375
[Mario] Hang on tight, and up we go!

2080
01:39:40,376 --> 01:39:41,643
All right!

2081
01:39:41,644 --> 01:39:43,315
I deserve to die, I need to!

2082
01:39:43,316 --> 01:39:44,149
Let go!

2083
01:39:44,150 --> 01:39:45,445
[Mario] And I need to save you, moron!

2084
01:39:45,446 --> 01:39:47,285
Why do you even care about me, Mario?

2085
01:39:47,286 --> 01:39:49,375
Beats the hell out of me, you jack ass.

2086
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:51,975
But I couldn't just sit there
and watch you get demolished.

2087
01:39:51,976 --> 01:39:53,405
You could have easily done so,

2088
01:39:53,406 --> 01:39:55,235
I never asked for your accursed help!

2089
01:39:55,236 --> 01:39:57,855
You don't have to ask,
because I'm doing it anyway!

2090
01:39:57,856 --> 01:39:59,235
And if you really didn't want my help,

2091
01:39:59,236 --> 01:40:01,675
then you wouldn't be holding
on for dear life right now!

2092
01:40:01,676 --> 01:40:04,505
Face it, you're just as afraid
of dying as the rest of us.

2093
01:40:04,506 --> 01:40:05,895
So admit it already.

2094
01:40:05,896 --> 01:40:08,655
Stop acting like dying
is your only option.

2095
01:40:08,656 --> 01:40:11,125
You know as well as I do
that life is worth living,

2096
01:40:11,126 --> 01:40:13,876
and there's not a damn thing
wrong with that, is there?

2097
01:40:16,596 --> 01:40:17,596
[Ryu] I.

2098
01:40:19,426 --> 01:40:20,499
I just.

2099
01:40:23,093 --> 01:40:25,876
Kutou, it's okay.

2100
01:40:33,284 --> 01:40:38,284
[Mario] Hey, Kutou, you've
got to snap out of it, man!

2101
01:40:38,513 --> 01:40:40,575
[Ryu] I want to live.

2102
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:44,509
Despite everything, I want to keep living.

2103
01:40:52,808 --> 01:40:53,808
Whoa!

2104
01:40:55,252 --> 01:40:57,669
Those three pillars of light!

2105
01:40:59,047 --> 01:41:02,065
They mean that's our first class

2106
01:41:02,066 --> 01:41:04,495
one-way ticket out of here, baby!

2107
01:41:04,496 --> 01:41:06,083
Sure ain't no stairway to Heaven,

2108
01:41:06,084 --> 01:41:08,345
but it'll bring you back home!

2109
01:41:08,346 --> 01:41:10,839
Cross the Sanzu River, baby!

2110
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:12,279
Go cross that river!

2111
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:14,530
(cheering)

2112
01:41:36,324 --> 01:41:39,657
[Kiki] You just want to save yourself.

2113
01:41:42,892 --> 01:41:44,892
How can you be so cruel?

2114
01:41:45,793 --> 01:41:46,971
[Mario] Kutou!

2115
01:41:46,972 --> 01:41:49,518
- Please stop it Kiki!
- You're right, Kiki.

2116
01:41:49,519 --> 01:41:51,345
I'm selfish.

2117
01:41:51,346 --> 01:41:53,019
I don't know what I was thinking.

2118
01:41:56,902 --> 01:41:58,819
[Kiki] It's not fair!

2119
01:42:00,797 --> 01:42:03,979
[Ryu Voiceover] I don't
deserve forgiveness.

2120
01:42:06,256 --> 01:42:08,235
[Rinne] Hold on Kiki!

2121
01:42:08,236 --> 01:42:09,815
Snap out of it!

2122
01:42:09,816 --> 01:42:12,185
It's me, it's your friend Rinne, come on!

2123
01:42:12,186 --> 01:42:13,773
Don't you recognize me?

2124
01:42:16,161 --> 01:42:19,411
(Kiki cries in dismay)

2125
01:42:24,753 --> 01:42:26,836
[Mario] Kutou, come on!

2126
01:42:31,369 --> 01:42:33,286
[Kiki] It's not fair.

2127
01:42:34,589 --> 01:42:37,103
Hey Rinne, what's going on?

2128
01:42:37,104 --> 01:42:38,785
Why'd she start crying all of a sudden?

2129
01:42:38,786 --> 01:42:40,635
[Rinne] Kiki's just scared,

2130
01:42:40,636 --> 01:42:43,575
I don't think she's in
control of her body anymore.

2131
01:42:43,576 --> 01:42:45,385
Yeah she might look like this.

2132
01:42:45,386 --> 01:42:47,069
[Mario] Rinne, behind you!

2133
01:42:47,070 --> 01:42:49,989
But this is Kiki, she's our friend.

2134
01:43:04,009 --> 01:43:06,575
The path through the Sanzu River!

2135
01:43:06,576 --> 01:43:08,065
Keep heading that direction!

2136
01:43:08,066 --> 01:43:10,609
- Yeah, but.
- Just trust me!

2137
01:43:12,797 --> 01:43:14,205
Be careful, Rinne!

2138
01:43:14,206 --> 01:43:15,879
You have to trust yourselves!

2139
01:43:18,128 --> 01:43:21,045
(groaning in pain)

2140
01:43:24,021 --> 01:43:25,416
(shouting in dismay)

2141
01:43:25,417 --> 01:43:27,860
(screams)

2142
01:43:27,861 --> 01:43:28,861
Rinne!

2143
01:43:32,137 --> 01:43:35,438
(shouting in dismay)

2144
01:43:35,439 --> 01:43:38,436
Everyone, please just listen to me!

2145
01:43:38,437 --> 01:43:39,437
Stop it now!

2146
01:43:45,529 --> 01:43:46,529
What?

2147
01:43:51,097 --> 01:43:52,097
Steela?

2148
01:44:07,039 --> 01:44:08,039
Steela!

2149
01:44:09,812 --> 01:44:11,448
Get out of there now!

2150
01:44:11,449 --> 01:44:14,136
If you don't that thing will kill you!

2151
01:44:14,137 --> 01:44:15,637
Please, answer me!

2152
01:44:49,766 --> 01:44:52,016
(coughing)

2153
01:44:54,098 --> 01:44:57,348
[Kiki] Our bodies are back to normal!

2154
01:44:59,230 --> 01:45:01,769
- The seven sins are gone!
- And we all survived!

2155
01:45:02,978 --> 01:45:05,061
(crying)

2156
01:45:22,206 --> 01:45:23,956
[Rinne] It's as if she was saying

2157
01:45:25,356 --> 01:45:27,159
just leave it to me.

2158
01:45:28,026 --> 01:45:30,545
Isn't that right, Steela?

2159
01:45:30,546 --> 01:45:31,546
Isn't it?

2160
01:45:39,771 --> 01:45:40,938
How could you?

2161
01:45:43,300 --> 01:45:46,645
How could you do this to yourself?

2162
01:45:46,646 --> 01:45:47,935
I get it,

2163
01:45:47,936 --> 01:45:51,145
you wanted to give everyone the
opportunity to go back home.

2164
01:45:51,146 --> 01:45:52,146
Didn't you?

2165
01:45:53,406 --> 01:45:55,619
But that can't happen now.

2166
01:45:57,906 --> 01:46:01,599
Because you're part of
everyone too you know!

2167
01:46:02,514 --> 01:46:03,514
Steela!

2168
01:46:05,306 --> 01:46:07,389
(crying)

2169
01:46:09,626 --> 01:46:11,459
Why did you lie to me?

2170
01:46:12,493 --> 01:46:15,569
You told me that we would
always be together, didn't you?

2171
01:46:16,687 --> 01:46:18,697
Answer me, Steela!

2172
01:46:18,698 --> 01:46:21,577
Please say something, anything!

2173
01:46:21,578 --> 01:46:22,578
Please!

2174
01:46:23,736 --> 01:46:25,636
And where do you think you're going?

2175
01:46:26,626 --> 01:46:28,855
Abandoning the person who
saved your asses, huh?

2176
01:46:28,856 --> 01:46:31,615
We're going home,
that's what she wanted.

2177
01:46:31,616 --> 01:46:32,449
Listen up,

2178
01:46:32,450 --> 01:46:34,385
you know Steela didn't turn
into that godforsaken thing

2179
01:46:34,386 --> 01:46:36,505
just so piss ants like you
could hightail it home.

2180
01:46:36,506 --> 01:46:37,905
She needs us now dammit,

2181
01:46:37,906 --> 01:46:39,835
so stop running your mouth and help!

2182
01:46:39,836 --> 01:46:41,495
[Man] But that's impossible.

2183
01:46:41,496 --> 01:46:42,755
[Mario] Oh, excuse you?

2184
01:46:42,756 --> 01:46:44,605
It's no use wasting our effort.

2185
01:46:44,606 --> 01:46:47,235
Honestly there's nothing left we can do.

2186
01:46:47,236 --> 01:46:48,645
Wasting?

2187
01:46:48,646 --> 01:46:50,085
Nothing?

2188
01:46:50,086 --> 01:46:51,715
After everything we fought for,

2189
01:46:51,716 --> 01:46:53,015
now that you've got a way home,

2190
01:46:53,016 --> 01:46:54,995
it's time to just to
pack up and screw off?

2191
01:46:54,996 --> 01:46:56,802
We believed just like
you told us to Mario,

2192
01:46:56,803 --> 01:47:00,028
and you saw how far that got us!

2193
01:47:00,029 --> 01:47:02,965
If this is how you're gonna
act them I'm done with...

2194
01:47:02,966 --> 01:47:05,193
There, is that a little better?

2195
01:47:06,343 --> 01:47:08,975
What's so wrong with
letting us go home, huh?

2196
01:47:08,976 --> 01:47:11,529
Nobody asked Steela to
sacrifice herself for us!

2197
01:47:11,530 --> 01:47:13,552
The only thing we
can do is move forward!

2198
01:47:13,553 --> 01:47:17,708
Back the hell up! (chattering)

2199
01:47:17,709 --> 01:47:21,029
Dammit, we're supposed
to be humans, aren't we?

2200
01:47:22,038 --> 01:47:24,388
If we keep this up, we'll
all just break apart!

2201
01:47:31,006 --> 01:47:33,725
[Rinne Voiceover] Why
is everyone fighting?

2202
01:47:33,726 --> 01:47:34,726
I can't take it.

2203
01:47:38,836 --> 01:47:39,886
[Ryu] Miss Amagane.

2204
01:47:41,070 --> 01:47:43,845
[Rinne] Please, bring Steela back.

2205
01:47:43,846 --> 01:47:46,542
[Ryu] This world is no
longer mine to control.

2206
01:47:46,543 --> 01:47:49,819
There's nothing I or
anyone else can do now.

2207
01:47:50,792 --> 01:47:51,875
[Rinne] No.

2208
01:47:53,706 --> 01:47:57,155
Steela was my creation just
like the world of Hell itself.

2209
01:47:57,156 --> 01:47:59,995
The same Hell that I
dragged you down into.

2210
01:47:59,996 --> 01:48:01,849
You can blame me for everything.

2211
01:48:02,869 --> 01:48:05,935
I know it might not be
my place to say this,

2212
01:48:05,936 --> 01:48:08,765
but Steela's only wish was
for you to return home.

2213
01:48:08,766 --> 01:48:10,995
I think you should try
your best to accept that,

2214
01:48:10,996 --> 01:48:12,313
miss Amagane.

2215
01:48:12,314 --> 01:48:13,665
[Rinne] I can't do that.

2216
01:48:13,666 --> 01:48:14,805
I won't!

2217
01:48:14,806 --> 01:48:18,461
I'll try to honor her wish
as well and abandon my hatred.

2218
01:48:18,462 --> 01:48:21,629
And finally reconnect with my big brother.

2219
01:48:21,630 --> 01:48:23,305
[Helvis] Brother?

2220
01:48:23,306 --> 01:48:25,495
He called me big brother.

2221
01:48:25,496 --> 01:48:26,701
You can cry.

2222
01:48:26,702 --> 01:48:30,737
Never hide it and never hold
it back, it means you're human.

2223
01:48:30,738 --> 01:48:33,421
[Helvis Voiceover] No,
ain't no way I'm gonna cry.

2224
01:48:33,422 --> 01:48:36,838
I taught all my students that
if they wish, it'll come true,

2225
01:48:36,839 --> 01:48:40,695
knowing all the while that
sometimes it just won't.

2226
01:48:40,696 --> 01:48:43,345
But unless you wish for
something nothing will ever begin!

2227
01:48:43,346 --> 01:48:48,346
And that's why I'll never
stop saying it! (crying)

2228
01:48:48,450 --> 01:48:53,367
[Mother] You're right, let's
put our trust in those kids.

2229
01:48:54,946 --> 01:48:57,019
[Ryu] Please, we should go.

2230
01:48:57,858 --> 01:49:00,275
No. (sobs)

2231
01:49:03,636 --> 01:49:06,955
I can't go, not after
everything Steela did for us!

2232
01:49:06,956 --> 01:49:07,969
It's not fair!

2233
01:49:13,996 --> 01:49:17,465
[Steela] Thanks to you
I felt like I had meaning.

2234
01:49:17,466 --> 01:49:20,169
Like I could do something
for the first time.

2235
01:49:21,196 --> 01:49:22,696
That was enough for me, Rinne.

2236
01:49:24,244 --> 01:49:27,279
Because I'm no longer nothing.

2237
01:49:29,626 --> 01:49:31,129
You did that for me.

2238
01:49:32,721 --> 01:49:36,879
So please, don't cry anymore.

2239
01:49:38,396 --> 01:49:42,805
I'll always be with you, together forever.

2240
01:49:42,806 --> 01:49:44,959
I'm so sorry.

2241
01:49:48,817 --> 01:49:51,189
[Phantoma] Hey, did you guys hear that?

2242
01:49:52,173 --> 01:49:55,035
[Man] Yeah, we can
hear them clear as day.

2243
01:49:55,036 --> 01:49:56,079
Two voices, right?

2244
01:49:57,733 --> 01:50:00,145
[Ryu] Come, miss Amagane.

2245
01:50:00,146 --> 01:50:02,745
No, I'm not going back.

2246
01:50:02,746 --> 01:50:05,193
Why does everyone keep fighting?

2247
01:50:05,194 --> 01:50:08,545
This is the world Steela
gave her life to protect.

2248
01:50:08,546 --> 01:50:11,915
So I can't just leave
it like this, not now.

2249
01:50:11,916 --> 01:50:13,695
Steela understood.

2250
01:50:13,696 --> 01:50:16,141
She knew even if not all wishes come true,

2251
01:50:16,142 --> 01:50:17,829
those feelings resonate.

2252
01:50:18,971 --> 01:50:20,779
Thank you, Steela.

2253
01:50:23,076 --> 01:50:24,099
I understand.

2254
01:50:25,226 --> 01:50:28,829
We'll take what you taught
us and learn from it.

2255
01:50:32,646 --> 01:50:33,679
We'll study hard.

2256
01:50:36,996 --> 01:50:37,996
One more time.

2257
01:50:39,341 --> 01:50:40,341
We can do it.

2258
01:50:41,299 --> 01:50:43,299
By rebuilding the academy.

2259
01:50:51,126 --> 01:50:53,915
[Who] Things were pretty
rough this time around,

2260
01:50:53,916 --> 01:50:55,435
to say the least.

2261
01:50:55,436 --> 01:50:57,815
Looks like we've got a lot to learn,

2262
01:50:57,816 --> 01:51:00,466
if we don't want something
like this to happen again.

2263
01:51:01,596 --> 01:51:04,449
The only way to learn is to study hard.

2264
01:51:06,109 --> 01:51:10,155
And that is the very
reason why my stupid son

2265
01:51:10,156 --> 01:51:13,865
built Sanzu River Academy
in the first place.

2266
01:51:13,866 --> 01:51:15,725
We did it Steela, see?

2267
01:51:15,726 --> 01:51:18,525
We were able to rebuild the whole academy.

2268
01:51:18,526 --> 01:51:19,406
[Mario] I think I'm dead.

2269
01:51:19,407 --> 01:51:22,125
I think I'm gonna go extinct.

2270
01:51:22,126 --> 01:51:24,845
(groans)

2271
01:51:24,846 --> 01:51:26,975
Everyone's wishes came true.

2272
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:29,219
Because we all worked together.

2273
01:51:31,579 --> 01:51:35,216
It's finished, it was all
thanks to you, Steela.

2274
01:51:36,806 --> 01:51:40,937
You did a wonderful job,
so no more regrets, okay?

2275
01:51:40,938 --> 01:51:43,097
(crash)

2276
01:51:43,098 --> 01:51:45,528
Miss Rinne Amagane.

2277
01:51:45,529 --> 01:51:48,159
I do declare that you've graduated baby!

2278
01:51:54,826 --> 01:51:57,625
[Kiki] But doesn't that
mean that Rinne's gonna?

2279
01:51:57,626 --> 01:52:00,481
[Wolfie] She's gonna go home, right?

2280
01:52:00,482 --> 01:52:03,002
Rinne, ow, what the hell?

2281
01:52:03,003 --> 01:52:05,535
Do I have to graduate first or something?

2282
01:52:05,536 --> 01:52:06,857
This is BS!

2283
01:52:06,858 --> 01:52:09,553
Mario, goodbye for now.

2284
01:52:09,554 --> 01:52:10,496
Hang on,

2285
01:52:10,497 --> 01:52:12,595
so are you really planning
to go back home to Earth?

2286
01:52:12,596 --> 01:52:13,566
Well good!

2287
01:52:13,567 --> 01:52:16,535
Cheer up Rinne, that's
the kind of girl you are!

2288
01:52:16,536 --> 01:52:18,055
Right?

2289
01:52:18,056 --> 01:52:20,423
Hey, listen, I, I'm in love!

2290
01:52:22,274 --> 01:52:24,355
I love you!

2291
01:52:24,356 --> 01:52:25,689
[Crowd] Rinne!

2292
01:52:27,189 --> 01:52:29,265
Once you've returned,

2293
01:52:29,266 --> 01:52:32,465
all memories pertaining
to Hell will be erased.

2294
01:52:32,466 --> 01:52:35,185
But the feelings you shared with everyone

2295
01:52:35,186 --> 01:52:38,315
will remain in the depths of your heart.

2296
01:52:38,316 --> 01:52:39,416
That's how humans are.

2297
01:52:49,566 --> 01:52:50,966
[Steela] Thank you, Rinne.

2298
01:52:53,782 --> 01:52:56,615
(machine beeping)

2299
01:53:00,826 --> 01:53:02,609
Welcome home, Rinne.

2300
01:53:06,796 --> 01:53:08,046
[Rinne] I'm home, mama.

2301
01:53:10,110 --> 01:53:12,225
(alarm ringing)
- Rinne,

2302
01:53:12,226 --> 01:53:14,361
you'll be late for school!

2303
01:53:14,362 --> 01:53:15,362
No!

2304
01:53:17,050 --> 01:53:18,050
I'm so late!

2305
01:53:22,477 --> 01:53:24,773
[Mother Voiceover] Students
of Sanzu River Academy,

2306
01:53:24,774 --> 01:53:28,373
please, protect my daughter.

2307
01:53:28,374 --> 01:53:30,249
I refuse to wipe out like last time!

2308
01:53:30,250 --> 01:53:33,475
I'm gonna make this the best first day-

2309
01:53:33,476 --> 01:53:36,097
After this, I swear.

2310
01:53:36,098 --> 01:53:39,181
(shouting in dismay)

2311
01:53:42,390 --> 01:53:44,390
Come on, hurry up Rinne!

2312
01:53:46,657 --> 01:53:49,296
(groans impatiently)

2313
01:53:49,297 --> 01:53:52,129
[Man] Whoa, hey look, what's she doing?

2314
01:53:52,130 --> 01:53:54,570
[Rinne Voiceover] It's a girl!

2315
01:53:54,571 --> 01:53:56,351
(yelling in dismay)

2316
01:53:56,352 --> 01:53:59,352
(wheels screeching)

2317
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:14,895
Good, you don't look like you're hurt.

2318
01:54:14,896 --> 01:54:15,965
Nice job back there,

2319
01:54:15,966 --> 01:54:18,625
but you got to make sure that
you take care of yourself too.

2320
01:54:18,626 --> 01:54:20,605
Why don't you take her from here?

2321
01:54:20,606 --> 01:54:22,269
You've got some guts, girl.

2322
01:54:25,076 --> 01:54:26,076
[Man] Ciao!

2323
01:54:27,411 --> 01:54:28,562
[Rinne Voiceover] Huh?

2324
01:54:28,563 --> 01:54:30,392
You saved me, thanks lady!

2325
01:54:30,393 --> 01:54:31,892
Oh, no problem at all.

2326
01:54:31,893 --> 01:54:34,739
How 'bout I walk you to
school, sound good Steela?

2327
01:54:36,066 --> 01:54:39,691
[Girl] Okay, but my name is Hiroko Yano.

2328
01:54:39,692 --> 01:54:41,025
What's a Steela?

2329
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:53,346
(bright instrumental music)

2330
01:55:11,612 --> 01:55:14,485
So do you know where
people go when they die?

2331
01:55:14,486 --> 01:55:16,318
[Demon] They all go to Hell.

2332
01:55:16,319 --> 01:55:18,763
If everyone goes to
Hell then what do they do?

2333
01:55:18,764 --> 01:55:22,235
[Demon] Well, they
study for their next life.

2334
01:55:22,236 --> 01:55:23,868
What do they study?

2335
01:55:23,869 --> 01:55:26,943
[Demon] Feeling that
out is the first step.

2336
01:55:26,944 --> 01:55:30,229
But don't you worry, there's
plenty to learn, baby.

2337
01:55:32,012 --> 01:55:33,912
[Girl] Hey lady, is something wrong?

2338
01:55:36,933 --> 01:55:40,289
It's just, I suddenly feel so happy.

2339
01:55:42,376 --> 01:55:43,376
Here.

2340
01:55:45,096 --> 01:55:46,096
Let's go.

2341
01:55:54,428 --> 01:55:58,345
(emotional instrumental music)

2342
01:57:58,227 --> 01:58:01,227
(upbeat rock music)

2343
01:58:04,678 --> 01:58:07,928
(singing in Japanese)
