1
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:39,875
[STUDENT A]
Have you heard yet?

2
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,208
[STUDENT B]
About what?

3
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,500
[STUDENT A] That transfer
student we're getting.

4
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,166
[STUDENT B]
Transfer student?

5
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,583
[RYOICHI]
It's kinda sweet...

6
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:10,208
This unique scent on the air.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,458
[RYOICHI]
So then...

8
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,291
This is the Earth.

9
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:33,833
[RYOICHI gasps]

10
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,000
Hey.

11
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:53,583
[KENJI] It was sunny and
full of cherry blossoms

12
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:57,083
on the day that I first
met Ryoichi Kyogoku.

13
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,208
[NATSUKI sighs]

14
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:29,125
[NATSUKI panting]

15
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:43,000
[KENJI] But, it turned
out that meeting Ryoichi

16
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,958
wasn't the only
event of the morning.

17
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,625
The morning itself
was pretty normal.

18
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:51,875
The usual breeze,
the usual sunshine.

19
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,375
[KAHORI]
You come by every day, right?

20
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,875
[KENJI]
Huh? Huh?!

21
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,000
[KAHORI] It's so nice that
you take him out for exercise.

22
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,875
Uh, yeah? I kinda have to.

23
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,791
Good boy! Now what's your name?

24
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:06,500
[giggles]

25
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,041
Uh... K-Kenji.

26
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,875
It's, uh... Kenji Seki.

27
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:10,708
[KAHORI laughs]

28
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:14,041
I was asking the dog, Seki.

29
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,625
I already know your name.

30
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,166
We're gonna be in
the same class.

31
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,958
--[SHIRO barks]
--[KAHORI laughs]

32
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:22,541
Uh... His name's Shiro.

33
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,416
Shiro for "white."

34
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,625
[KAHORI]
Well, hello there, Shiro.

35
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,166
[KENJI] We hadn't even
had our opening ceremony,

36
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,083
and I'd already
spoken to Harukawa

37
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,500
from the Student Council!

38
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,250
This was, without a doubt,

39
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:38,083
the highlight of my entire year!

40
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,958
Shiro! Nice job!

41
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,833
And today, will be
the greatest--

42
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,500
[NATSUKI]
Nice, you pervert!

43
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,291
What are you doing ogling
Kaho like some pervert?

44
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,750
Go and take that creepy
stare of yours outta here.

45
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:49,875
--Creepy...
--[KENJI growls]

46
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,750
Stop that! I was
not being creepy!

47
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,083
Mr. Policeman!

48
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:54,958
[KENJI]
Wha?!

49
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:55,625
There's a predator on the beach!

50
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:56,916
[KENJI]
Stop that!

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,166
--[NATSUKI] Somebody save me!
--[POLICE] Huh?

52
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,541
--Policeman! Over here!
--Natsuki! Cut it out!

53
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,166
[KENJI]
Ugh!

54
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,000
[groans]

55
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,125
[NATSUKI]
Yep, pervert.

56
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,208
You're-- You're the one who--

57
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,041
[NATSUKI]
And...

58
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,125
[KENJI]
Huh?

59
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,708
[NATSUKI]
That there is my evidence.

60
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:13,916
[KENJI gasps]
How long...?

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,416
[NATSUKI]
The whole time.

62
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,541
[KENJI]
Really?

63
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:17,541
[NATSUKI]
Really.

64
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,291
And I'm sure Kaho noticed.

65
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,791
Like, it's super obvious.

66
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:25,291
[KENJI groans]
Please kill me now.

67
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,541
[KENJI] So, the second
event of the morning

68
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,416
was this little tragedy.

69
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,833
Made much, much worse
by the fact that it

70
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,416
was witnessed by
Natsuki Suzuura.

71
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,458
If she ever spread
this around school,

72
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,125
I would be--

73
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,500
[groans]

74
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:42,291
Your new name is Mr. Open
Zipper from this day on.

75
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,541
--[KENJI gasps]
--[NATSUKI laughs]

76
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:44,958
[KENJI]
I had been presumptuous

77
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,291
in declaring it the
greatest day of my life.

78
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,666
[laughs nervously]

79
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,875
Yup, that's the guy!

80
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:50,791
[KENJI]
Seriously?!

81
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,500
[POLICE]
Hey, kid, over here!

82
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,541
[KENJI] Later, I'd realize
that meeting Kyogoku

83
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,000
is what had mattered
most that day.

84
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:03,291
I didn't have any
clue at the time.

85
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,541
It would still take me
a while to figure out

86
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:09,375
just how much had
been set in motion then.

87
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:10,500
[NATSUKI]
Kaho!

88
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:11,416
--[KAHORI giggles]
--[NATSUKI] Hey!

89
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,666
Saw you at the
beach earlier!

90
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,916
Oh, you were around?

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,916
[NATSUKI]
Mm-hm!

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,458
The beach is on
my jogging route.

93
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:18,833
[VICE PRINCIPAL]
So beginning this term,

94
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:22,333
all cell phones will be
banned from school property.

95
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:23,833
There'll be some push back,

96
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,583
but we ask that the faculty
does their part enforcing--

97
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:27,750
[MR. SAITO]
Sorry.

98
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,125
[RYOICHI gasps]

99
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,791
If you just take your seat,
I'll be right with you.

100
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,000
[RYOICHI]
Sure.

101
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,125
[KAHORI]
Oh, I ran into Seki afterward.

102
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,375
[NATSUKI]
Really?

103
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,625
[KAHORI] Yeah, he was
walking little Shiro!

104
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,000
[NATSUKI] You know, he used
to take that dog out at night.

105
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,958
It looks like he's tryna
be an early bird this year.

106
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:46,666
Kaho? What's wrong?

107
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,125
[KAHORI]
Huh? There's nothing wrong.

108
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,291
[NATSUKI] Oh, please,
do not tell me that boy

109
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,625
was at all
inappropriate with you!

110
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,875
Hey! Come on, I didn't
say anything like that.

111
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,541
[NATSUKI]
So! What then?

112
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,166
[NATSUKI]
What happened? Tell me!

113

[STUDENT C]
God, this sucks!

I can't believe they
banned cell phones.

I know, right?

for except the teachers?

--Aw, it's stupid is what it is!

your second year's

gotta be the worst!

Oh yeah. Wasn't she
in your club?

127
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,416
People have been
talking about her.

in class, too, Akari.

Sure, I'm just saying...

132
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,750
Even the Student Council's
on board with it.

[KAHORI]
Huh?

135
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,500
[STUDENT C] So, people who don't
understand what a pain this is

136
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,541
get to make up our
minds on our behalf.

137

Saori, be nice!

138
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,250
Why do we have to suffer
through some dumb rules

139
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,875
made up by people who
can't even relate to us?!

140
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,375
[MR. SAITO] If you can actually
stay focused during class,

141
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,916
then maybe we can re-evaluate
this cause of your suffering.

142
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,333
If that's all right.

143
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,166
Besides, I'm guessing
you're more annoyed

144
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,875
than truly inconvenienced
by this new rule of ours.

I respectfully disagree!

149
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,875
[MR. SAITO] Then, why not
run home between classes

150
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,041
to use your phone?

151

[SAORI] Huh? What'd be
the point of that?

[MR. SAITO] Saori, do you
actually need your phone

153
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,791
in the middle of class?

154

Not really, I guess.

00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,125
[MR. SAITO] Do you need
it during recess then?

Yeah! Of course!

157

Important business calls?

the problem with

didn't have cell phones.

Don't worry, that's it
for personal anecdotes.

Honestly though, just because
the internet and cell phones

in my class this semester.

316
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,583
[SOGA] Cell phones
may be convenient,

317
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,708
but if using them harms even
one of our own classmates,

318
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,291
then there isn't any choice.

319
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,583
They need to be
banned altogether.

320
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,375
That does seem like
the safest answer.

321
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,125
I think people are
really just upset

322
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,875
'cause they didn't get
a say in the matter.

323
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:29,958
[SOGA chuckles]

324
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,500
It's strange, isn't it?

325
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,250
Individually, anybody would
share our opinion.

326
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:37,291
But as a group, there's nothing
but outrage in the air.

327
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,125
There sure is.

328
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,541
I wonder if it's even
possible for us all

329
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:44,500
to choose our own
opinions to begin with.

330
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,833
Or if it's just... up to
whatever goes around in the air.

331
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,166
Now don't be silly.

332
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,291
Every one of us gets to
make up our own minds.

333

[piano music plays]

334
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,458
[JINNO] I wish things
would be that simple.

335
00:13:58,541 --> 00:13:59,708
[SOGA]
Of course, they are.

336
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,708
What do you mean?

337
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,375
[JINNO] Like, what if
someone causes you

338
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,791
to feel a certain
way about them?

339
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,291
[JINNO] Did you choose
that feeling yourself?

340
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:12,833
Or, do we get influenced by
something in between us

341
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:16,083
instead of what's
only inside our heads?

[RYOICHI] The room was free,
so I thought I'd practice.

354
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,083
Should I... have asked first?

No, don't worry.

I-It's fine!

All right.

Thank you.

360
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,833

come for practice also?

Uh, yeah!

[KAHORI]
Oh, no.

364
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,750
I just don't have
a piano of my own.

365
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:01,750
Really?

366
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,000
[KAHORI]
That was "Clair de Lune"?

[RYOICHI]
Mm?

368
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:11,458
[KAHORI]
Debussy's "Clair de Lune."

369
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:14,125
[RYOICHI]
Yeah. It means "moonlight."

Thanks.

while you're clearly relaxing.

385
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,250
Know that your abilities
were not meant to be...

386

...squandered in this era.

387
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,708
[RYOICHI] I could say the
same of you, showing up.

388
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:46,708
[FAMILIAR] I'm to pass your
report onto Professor Kyogoku.

I would hope you haven't
lost sight of your mission.

[FAMILIAR]
This is the moon.

391

It has a yellowish
hue in this era.

392
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,458
It's unsettling.

[RYOICHI]
Even so, it's beautiful.

[RYOICHI]
Yeah.

408
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:03,166
[KENJI] Hmm... Uh, I don't think
staging plays is about a point.

409
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,541
[RYOICHI]
Is it a rule?

410
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,041
It isn't. It's sort of about
something else, I guess.

00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,958

Sounds like you're quite

the young philosopher, Kyogoku.

[NATSUKI]
Hm?

417
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,875
Do you know why we do this?

418
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,791
Well, I'll try to answer.

419
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,875
The playwright of
"A Midsummer Night's Dream"

420
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,291
had said that when
it comes to acting,

421
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,750
its purpose is to "hold,

422
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,583
as 'twere, the mirror
up to nature;

423
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,375
to show virtue her own feature."

424
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,666
[giggles]

425
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,083
[MR. SAITO]
Virtue is well and good,

426
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,541
but we invented mirrors
to see ourselves.

427
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,375
So along with grand ideas,

428
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,166
I'd say acting could
also show us ourselves.

429
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,583
[RYOICHI]
That seems like a stretch.

430

--[NATSUKI] Hmph!

out of your own head

432
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:45,958
for a little while,

433
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,666
and try to understand a
totally different person.

434

Try to understand?

435
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,041
[MR. SAITO] Right! Maybe when
you experience that,

436
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,375
you'll finally be able to answer
your question for yourself.

437
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,458
They call that...
being in the moment.

438
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:02,583
Mr. Saito, way to dance
around simple questions.

439
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,875
[MR. SAITO chuckles]
Okay, a bit too grandiose.

440
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,208
But I do hope you guys
are able to enjoy this.

441
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,583
You're all here to learn!

442
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,250
And acting can offer you
kids as much life experience

443
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,958
as you're willing to let it.

444

[KAHORI]
Is Mr. Saito always so chatty?

445
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,500
[NATSUKI] Yeah. Me and
Kenji had him last year,

446
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,208
and the guy hasn't
changed a bit.

447

[KAHORI]
Really?

448
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,458
[KENJI]
Sai... is pretty laid-back.

449
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,458
Except about being called "Sai."

450
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,875
That, he hates.

451
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,458
[KAHORI chuckles] Oh, it really
bothers him that much?

452
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,708
[KENJI]
Not enough to stop anyone.

453

[GROUP laughs]

454
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:41,708
[KAHORI] Kyogoku, what made
you so curious earlier?

455
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:42,958
[NATSUKI]
Oh yeah, what's up?

456
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,250
[RYOICHI]
Hm...

457
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,500
I was just wondering
how it's useful to repeat

458
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:50,500
a bunch of words to each other
that none of us actually mean.

459
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,166
[NATSUKI] Well... that's just
what you do in school.

460
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,708
[RYOICHI]
I mean, they're not our words.

461
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,458
[NATSUKI]
Yeah, but...

462
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,750
I know it might seem
kind of pointless,

463
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,208
but it's not like anyone
is able to go around,

464
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:05,333
sharing exactly what we
mean in every little detail.

465
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,541
But everyone can share
the meaning of a play.

466
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,375
All right. I think I get it now.

467
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,916
[KENJI]
Huh...?

468
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,291
[groans]

469
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,083
[NATSUKI] Wow! You can't
even pretend you understand.

470
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,916
I... guess not. Oh!

471
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,500
[KAHORI giggles]

472
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,916
Looks like you can share what
you mean without words, too.

473
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,666
It would seem so.

474
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,833
And I guess I don't
understand anything!

475
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:26,916
[RYOICHI]
You know, Seki,

476
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,208
you might be a
little more intuitive

477
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,291
than you give
yourself credit for.

478
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,083
--[KENJI] Huh?
--[RYOICHI] Am I wrong?

479
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,125
Ha, ha! Are you kidding?
He's no mind reader!

480
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,583
[laughs]

481
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,625
[KENJI]
Oh...

482
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:43,875
[RYOICHI]
Mm.

483
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,708
[RYOICHI] Wow! The view from
up here is really amazing!

484
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,000
[NATSUKI]
I know, right?

485
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,416
Come on, you guys!

486
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,750
[RYOICHI]
A kite, like the bird?

487
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,041
[KAHORI]
Yeah, I'm not even kidding!

488
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,208
One swooped right down
and stole my lunch

489
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,833
when I was just a little kid.

490
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:05,708
[RYOICHI chuckles] That sounds
like a very rude bird.

491
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,625
[RYOICHI, KAHORI laugh]

492
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,791
It's nice and calm up here.

493
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,708
You think so?

494
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,083
That's nice.

495
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,375
I was hoping you'd like it.

496
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:18,500
[KENJI]
Hmph.

497
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:19,750
[NATSUKI]
Oops!

498
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,833
You better watch it or a
bird'll eat your food!

499
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,708
[KENJI]
Ugh!

500
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,791
[NATSUKI] You know, she'll just
think you're a pervert

501
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,583
if you keep gawking
at her like that.

502
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,291
Aw, crap! I was staring?

503
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:32,166
Yep, a whole lot.
Extremely perverted.

504
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,125
[KAHORI]
Hey, what's up?

505
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,166
[KENJI gasps]

506
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,125
[NATSUKI]
Nothing! We're good!

507
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:44,583
[KENJI sighs]

508
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,708
[NATSUKI]
Hmph.

509
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:51,083
[NATSUKI] Geez...
you're that hung up on her?

510
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:53,041
[KENJI chuckles]
So you're the mind reader.

511
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,916
[NATSUKI] Please, I don't need
to be when it comes to you.

512
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,500
[KENJI sighs]

513
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:00,125
[NATSUKI huffs] You're being way
too obvious, just get over it!

514
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,166
[KENJI]
I can't!

515
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,583
[NATSUKI]
Sure you can!

516
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:05,041
[KENJI]
Natsuki...

517
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:07,833
Don't act like you could
understand something like this.

518
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:11,166
[gasps, grunts]

519
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,166
[KENJI]
Huh?

520
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,750
[NATSUKI]
Why would you say that?

521
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:14,875
[KENJI]
Huh?

522
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,875
What the hell would
you know anyway?!

523
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:17,791
[KENJI gasps]
Natsuki?!

524
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,666
[NATSUKI grunts]

525
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,583
[KENJI groans]

526
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,208
[panting]

527
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:27,000
[groans]

528
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:29,208
Huh?

529
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,333
[gasps]

530
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:35,208
[sniffs, cries]

531
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:36,625
[KENJI]
Huh?

532
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,250
Natsuki?

533
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:49,791
[MAGICIAN]
And what you drew on the card...

534
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:51,916
...was none other than this!

535
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,833
Whoa! You got it! That's it!
But how did you do it?

536
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:58,291
[MAGICIAN] I heard the
answer within your heart.

537
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,583
[TV MAN]
Wow!

538
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:01,625
[applause]

539
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:04,541
Telepathy, it's just
a matter of science.

540
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:06,041
[KENJI'S GRANDPA]
Oh...

541
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:08,583
[KENJI] That stuff's
obviously just an act.

542
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:11,250
Yeah, I suppose that
it would have to be.

543
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:14,125
[KENJI] Life would be a lot
easier if I could read minds.

544
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,500
Boy, can I not.

545
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,416
You know, psychic powers
are like cell phones.

546
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,750
When you're old enough,

547
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,166
you'll find that you don't
even really need 'em.

548
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,625
[KENJI] What's that gotta
do with being old?

549
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:25,208
Oh, I do admit that
holding onto mine

550
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:27,750
does make certain
things easier for me.

551
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,625
Grandpa Koji! You've got
psychic powers?!

552
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:35,083
No... I was talking
about my cell phone.

553
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:39,250
But why the sudden
interest in powers of mind?

554
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:40,833
[KENJI]
Mm... Hm...

555
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:42,708
Haven't you ever wondered
just what the hell

556
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:44,500
other people are
really thinking?

557
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,583
'Cause I sure do.

558
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:48,166
Huh?

559
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,666
Now you always know
exactly how to help.

560
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,833
Thanks a lot.

561
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:54,625
Guess I needed that.

562
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:55,458
[KOJI]
Hm.

563
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:56,708
[KENJI'S MOTHER]
Kenji!

564
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:58,666
Come help your
father in the kitchen!

565
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,333
[KENJI]
Coming!

566
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:11,666
[clack]

567
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,208

[NATSUKI gasps]

574
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:00,958
[NATSUKI]
Dammit, that's enough-- Ah!

575
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:01,666
[gasps]

576
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,500
You okay?

577
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:03,333
Ow!

578
00:26:03,416 --> 00:26:05,166
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry!

579
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,833
What the hell do
you want from me?!

580
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:09,000
I tried calling. You wouldn't
answer your cell--

581
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:10,250
Not an answer!

582
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:13,625
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry for earlier.

583
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:14,208
[NATSUKI]
Huh?

584
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:15,458
[KENJI]
Sorry.

585
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:18,000
I'm sorry that I said
you couldn't understand.

586
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:21,416
I need you to know...
The truth is...

587
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,916
...that I...

588
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,291
I actually...

589
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:30,833
I really do like,
uh... Harukawa.

590
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:32,166
[gasps]

591
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,916
[KENJI] So, I really want
some advice from a girl

592
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,375
on how I should, you know--

593
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:37,458
[NATSUKI growls]
Goddamn moron!

594
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:43,000
[grunts, coughs]

595
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:44,791
[KENJI]
What just happened?

596
00:27:02,291 --> 00:27:07,250
[GIRL gasping, panting]

597
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:39,625
You can't do this.

598
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:41,625
[gasps]

599
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:45,625

[GIRL crying]

601
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:02,708
[GIRL sobs]
Why? Why bother saving me?

602
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:03,833
[RYOICHI]
Why?

603
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:05,791
I didn't do anything.

604
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:09,583
You never really meant to jump
in the first place, did you?

605
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:18,375
Don't talk to me
like you know me!

606
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:20,541
[RYOICHI]
You're Yuriko Yamagiwa,

607
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:23,041
in your second year
of middle school...

608
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:24,708
...for the second time.

609
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:27,916
You think that no one ever
understands how you feel,

610
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,708
so you figure you
may as well jump.

611
00:28:30,791 --> 00:28:32,625
But you never actually
wanted to die.

612
00:28:32,708 --> 00:28:34,125
What the hell's with you?!

613
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:35,791
You've never even met me before!

614
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:40,041
Yes, that's right. I didn't
need to. After all...

615
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,458
...I can just understand you.

616
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:50,125
It's so clear, the voice
inside your heart.

617
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:57,625
[sniffles, laughs]

618
00:28:57,708 --> 00:29:02,333
You do want to live,
more than most people.

619
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:04,500
And you're right, no one
else understands--

620
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:05,916
[YURIKO]
Just shut up!

621
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,958

00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:14,625
[RYOICHI]
Yeah, I know.

624
00:29:14,708 --> 00:29:17,166
This girl could be
a perfect candidate.

625
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:21,208
[gasps]

626
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,625
[RYOICHI]
Do you want to understand...

627
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:30,333
...what others really think?

628
00:29:30,416 --> 00:29:32,000
Wait, what are you--

629
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:34,291
[RYOICHI]
You already have the potential,

630
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:38,625
and that is why I was able to
hear the sound of inner voice.

631
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:42,083
[YURIKO] What is this?!
Tell me what's happening!

632
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:43,500
[YURIKO whimpers]

633
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:48,125
Come with me, Yuriko.
And I promise...

634
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:51,833
I promise that no one
can ever lie to you.

635
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:21,583
[KAHORI'S MOTHER]
Kaho, you still there?

636
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:25,125
[KAHORI gasps]
Sorry... I'm here!

637
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:29,958
[KAHORI]
Sure, don't work too late, Mom.

638
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:34,291
[KAHORI]
Bye.

639
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,125
[sighs]

640
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:38,166
[chuckles]

641

[overlapping voices]

642
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:09,000
[NATSUKI]
What? I'm trying to sleep.

643
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:11,833
Whenever I'm pissed off,
I just wanna stay in bed.

644
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:18,208
[overlapping voices]

645
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:22,333
[NATSUKI]
Will you just stop bothering me?

646
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:24,500
What the hell do you want?

647
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:28,500
[KENJI] Natsu, they're
so great, aren't they?

648
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:33,916
[NATSUKI] I like you, Ken,
I like you... a whole lot, Ken.

649
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:36,500
[gasps]

650
00:31:38,958 --> 00:31:42,083
They're so cool!
Don't cha think?

651
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,375
I think we'll see 'em
even better over there!

652
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:46,208
Come on!

653
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:47,291
[NATSUKI yelps]

654
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:49,458
[footsteps]

655
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:52,708
[NATSUKI]
Hey, Ken, tell me.

656
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:53,875
[KENJI]
Hm?

657
00:31:53,958 --> 00:31:54,916
[NATSUKI] What do
you wanna be some day

658
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,625
when you're all grown up?

659
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,875
I'm gonna stay and run the inn

660
00:31:59,958 --> 00:32:02,333
because everybody
loves staying there.

661
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:05,875
That's great!

662
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:09,583
That means that you and me
will stay neighbors forever.

663
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:14,500
[KENJI] Don't you want to move
away to Tokyo or something?

664
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:17,416
[NATSUKI] I like you
more than anybody, Ken.

665
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,458
[KENJI]
What?

666
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:21,625
[NATSUKI]
I said, I really like you a lot.

667
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:22,875
[KENJI]
Hm?

668
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:28,208
[NATSUKI] I like you
the best, Ken! I mean it!

669
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:29,833
What's that?

670
00:32:29,916 --> 00:32:34,291
I like you! A lot! A lot!

671
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:40,583
[gasps]

672
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:41,833
[KENJI]
Huh?!

673
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,708
I said that--

674
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:46,791
[alarm rings]

675
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:49,791
I like you the very,
very best, Ken!

676
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:51,750
I like you so much!

677
00:32:51,833 --> 00:32:53,333
I love you!

678
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:08,916
[NATSUKI]
That dream again...

679
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,666
[NATSUKI] How long's it been...
since I had that one?

680
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:18,916
[NATSUKI'S MOTHER]
Natsuki?

681
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,583
Are you up yet?

682
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,333
[NATSUKI] I should've
learned back then that

683
00:33:23,416 --> 00:33:25,958
no matter what, the two of us

684
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:29,041
could only ever be so
close to each other.

685
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:32,541
We've lived next door to
each other our whole lives.

686
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:38,125
Same preschool, same elementary
school, same junior high.

687
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:40,625
We were always classmates.

688
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:44,125
Even our lockers were
right next to each other.

689
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:48,500
I'm his next door
neighbor and...

690
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:51,000
...that's all I am to him.

691
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:53,708
That's how it's been and...

692
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:58,375
...that's how
it'll stay... always.

693
00:33:58,458 --> 00:34:01,000
Always...

694
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:03,500
[KENJI]
Huh? Oh, Natsuki--

695
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,541
[KENJI gasps]

696
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:13,875
[NATSUKI cries]

697
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:17,125
[NATSUKI]
If I could just...

698
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:20,166
[NATSUKI giggles]

699
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,750
[NATSUKI]...make myself
feel nothing for him.

700
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:34,333
[STUDENTS murmuring]

701
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:35,375
[NATSUKI]
Hm?

702
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:43,791
[NATSUKI]
You guys going in?

703
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:44,625
[STUDENTS]
Um...

704
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:47,291
Then quit blocking the door.

705
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:49,583
[NATSUKI]
Hey, Yamagiwa, what's up?

706
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:51,500
[YURIKO]
Good morning, Suzuura.

707
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:53,916
[NATSUKI] Oh! I didn't
realize you knew everyone's

708
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,833
names already.

709
00:34:54,916 --> 00:34:56,166
[YURIKO]
From the seating chart.

710
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,000
[RYOICHI]
Good morning.

711
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:58,500
[NATSUKI]
Uh, morning!

712
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:02,375
[YURIKO chuckles]

713
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:03,416
[NATSUKI]
Uh...

714
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:09,708
[KAHORI]
Yuriko seems pretty mellow now,

715
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:11,708
like nothing even happened.

716
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:13,333
[NATSUKI]
Yeah, but what's changed?

717
00:35:13,416 --> 00:35:15,875
Why start coming to school now?

718
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:17,208
Good for her, though.

719
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:18,916
[KAHORI]
You were worried about her?

720
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,833
[NATSUKI]
I guess I was.

721
00:35:20,916 --> 00:35:23,833
But, I'm also kind of nuts
about never missing any school.

722
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:25,458
[KAHORI] So you've still
got perfect attendance?

723
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,041
[NATSUKI laughs]
Sure do!

724
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,250
[KAHORI]
Miss World Champion.

725
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:30,791
Any potential threats
to your record?

726
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:32,000
[NATSUKI]
I never get sick.

727
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:34,333
[KAHORI]
So not even lovesick, then?

728
00:35:34,416 --> 00:35:35,458
[laughs]

729
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:37,208
No way, not a chance!

730
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:39,166
[KAHORI]
You never know.

731
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,833
--Sometimes it just... happens.
--[NATSUKI] Not to me.

732
00:35:40,916 --> 00:35:42,791
And if it did, I think
that I'd just spend

733
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:45,500
even more time here at school,
to keep an eye on him.

734
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:48,041
[KAHORI] Knowing you,
yeah, I guess you would.

735
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:50,083
So... How 'bout
that transfer student?

736
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:51,291
[KAHORI gasps]

737
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:55,208
[laughs]
Oh, come on, Kaho!

738
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:58,250
You know I'm gonna make you tell
me everything no matter what!

739
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:39,375
[BOTH]
Huh?

740
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:41,166
[KENJI]
Uh...

741
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,166
This is great.

742
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,666
Seki, you're already here!

743
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,041
[KENJI]
Uh... Huh?!

744
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:48,333
[BOTH]
Huh?

745
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:49,750
Wait, why are you here?

746
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,750
Huh? Wait! Hold on!

747
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:53,250
Why are you questioning me?!

748
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:55,666
Like, how am I supposed
to respond to that?!

749
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,250
Uh! Sorry, I must've just, uh--

750
00:36:58,333 --> 00:36:59,458
[YURIKO giggles]

751
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:01,125
Sorry, my mistake.

752
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:03,541
Please, go ahead and ignore me.

753
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:05,333
Huh...?

Photographing the sky?

755
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:12,708
Specifically, the clouds.

756
00:37:12,791 --> 00:37:14,041
The clouds?

757
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:16,125
Yeah, these are ones that
I think look like stuff.

758
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:18,583
[RYOICHI]
Oh, so what's this one?

759
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:22,333
Uh, oh, this?
It's a burger!

760
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:25,000
Huh? Okay... What's this?

761
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:26,166
It's a cheeseburger.

762
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,166
[laughs]

763
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:27,958
[KENJI]
Huh?

764
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:29,375
[RYOICHI]
Oh, come on!

765
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:30,791
--I can't believe you!
--Hey, just take a closer look!

766
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:32,666
This part totally looks
like melted cheese!

767
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,875
--[stomach rumbles]
--[BOTH] Huh?

768
00:37:35,958 --> 00:37:37,875
You wanna get something to eat?

769
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:39,333
[KENJI]
Mm-hm.

770
00:37:39,416 --> 00:37:43,833
[platform beeps]

771
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:52,125
[NATSUKI sighs] I guess love
at first sight is real, huh?

772
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:54,500
[KAHORI] Hey, I'm really
sorry for making you

773
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:57,583
listen to me go on
and on like this.

774
00:37:57,666 --> 00:37:59,833
[NATSUKI] No, I'm glad
that you're sharing.

775
00:37:59,916 --> 00:38:02,708
You're so proper and you
hold things in sometimes.

776
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:04,166
[KAHORI]
I'm trying to keep it together,

777
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,125
but... I'm not that proper.

778
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:07,875
It's okay if you are, Kaho.

779
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:11,583
That transfer student's
one lucky boy.

780
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:14,333
He's great at the piano, too.

781
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:16,500
[NATSUKI]
And talented, too.

782
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:18,583
[nervous chuckle]

783
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:21,458
[KAHORI] It's so weird to
feel all this out of nowhere,

784
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:23,041
and for someone I just met.

785
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:26,000
[NATSUKI] Aw... I wouldn't
stress out about it.

786
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:29,541
No one's ever said that love
makes any sort of sense.

787
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:31,041
[KAHORI]
I guess not.

788
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:34,083
[NATSUKI] That's the one thing
about love that I do know.

789
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:41,458
[NATSUKI] So, exactly when are
you spilling your guts to him?

790
00:38:41,541 --> 00:38:43,958
[KAHORI] Um, I was
planning to just... not?

791
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:47,291
[NATSUKI] What? Why?! You've
gotta be straight with that boy.

792
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:49,750
And while you still
have a shot with him.

793
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:53,041
[KAHORI sighs]
Losing my shot sounds easier.

794
00:38:57,791 --> 00:38:59,625
[elevator dings]

795
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:01,958
[BOTH]
Wow!

796
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:04,208
[KAHORI]
The view is amazing today!

797
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:07,125
I-I don't ever think it's
been so pretty from up here.

798
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:09,666
I think this might be
the most beautiful sunset

799
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:13,166
that I've ever seen
in my whole life.

800
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,833
[chuckles]

801
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:17,958
[KAHORI]
Natsuki...

802
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:19,291
[NATSUKI]
Yeah?

803
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:22,541
[KAHORI] You really don't
have a crush on anyone?

804
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:23,916
[NATSUKI]
Nope, not me.

805
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,708
[KAHORI]
Come on... What about Seki?

806
00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:28,166
[NATSUKI]
Geez, Kaho...

807
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:31,958
The boy has been my next
door neighbor like, forever.

808
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:36,291
And how could I ever like
somebody as dense as him?

809
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:39,500
[KAHORI] Oh... So that's
really how you feel?

810
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:45,166
[gasps]

811
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:45,875
Natsuki?

812
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:47,916
I already told you.

813
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,166
We're just friends,
nothing more, nothing less.

814
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,750
He and I are simply
neighbors, that's all.

815
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:56,208
And if you don't
believe me, just ask him.

816
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:58,458
He would say the
exact same thing.

817
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,583
[KENJI] You really
are mysterious, you know?

818
00:40:05,666 --> 00:40:06,875
[RYOICHI]
Why's that?

819
00:40:06,958 --> 00:40:10,125
[KENJI] You've never
eaten a single hamburger!

820
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:11,958
[RYOICHI]
And that's mysterious?

821
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:15,041
[KENJI] Yeah! Are your
parents strict about food?

822
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:19,083
No, it's nothing like that.

823
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:21,583
[RYOICHI]
It's nice...

824
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:23,833
[KENJI]
Hm? Ah...

825
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:31,791
[KENJI] Hey, there's something
I keep meaning to ask you about.

826
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:33,375
[RYOICHI]
What's that?

827
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:37,166
[KENJI] What did you mean by,
"So then, this is the Earth"?

828
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,916
[RYOICHI]
Have you told anyone about that?

829
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,666
[KENJI]
No? I shouldn't?

830
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,291
[RYOICHI] People...
might think that I'm strange.

831
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:44,875
[KENJI]
A little too late for that!

832
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:46,208
[RYOICHI chuckles]

833
00:40:46,291 --> 00:40:48,333
But weren't you wearing
your headphones back then?

834
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:50,875
Uh... I guess so.

835
00:40:50,958 --> 00:40:53,291
[RYOICHI] So you're a
mind reader, after all.

836
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:55,208
I must be.

837
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:56,458
[RYOICHI]
You'd heard right.

838
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:58,375
[KENJI]
Huh?

839
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:00,916
But I wasn't speaking
out loud then.

840
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,500
I know how this sounds, but I
do think you're a psychic.

841
00:41:05,958 --> 00:41:07,625
It's hard to tell
when you're joking.

842
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:09,250
[RYOICHI]
I'm being serious.

843
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:11,083
So you're what? An alien?

844
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:12,500
[RYOICHI]
Don't be silly.

845
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:14,583
I'm from the future.

846
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:16,666
[laughing]

847
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,000
And now we've got a
psychic and a time traveler

848
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:20,625
eating hamburgers together,

849
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:23,500
as they whimsically
admire the sunset.

850
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:25,250
It would seem so.

851
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,708
[RYOICHI] Couldn't have
said it better myself.

852
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:36,875
[MAGICIAN]
Now I'll reach into the future

853
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:39,083
and grab the food
you most desire.

854
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:40,041
[TV MAN]
What?

855
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:43,375
[MAGICIAN]
3... 2... 1... Open!

856
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:45,041
--[TV MAN] Wow!
--From the future, huh?

857
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:46,541
[MAGICIAN] You wanted
a hamburger, didn't you?

858
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:47,958
[TV MAN]
Yeah, I did!

859
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:51,333
[MAGICIAN] Time warp,
it's just a matter of science.

860
00:41:51,416 --> 00:41:52,750
[FAMILIAR]
Ryoichi...

861
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:56,083
You're spending your time
sampling this era's food?!

862
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:59,166
Don't get any more
involved than needed,

863
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,833
especially if you're aware
that this Seki boy is--

864
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:03,875
[RYOICHI]
He'd only get in our way.

865
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:05,083
Wouldn't he?

866
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:08,916
Even so, my dad went
and picked his era.

867
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,708
Just for revenge.

868
00:42:11,791 --> 00:42:13,416
[FAMILIAR]
It's not my place to speculate

869
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,166
on the Professor's
personal feelings.

870
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,791
[RYOICHI]
Is conflict unavoidable?

871
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:21,291
[FAMILIAR] The boy could
indeed pose a threat.

872
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:23,833
I can say nothing
further on the matter.

873
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,916
Now, let's move forward
with the mission.

874
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,041
You've already found several
that have latent abilities,

875
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:31,833
so let us allow the
people of this era

876
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:35,125
to adequately handle
their own affairs.

877
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:45,666
[NATSUKI exhales]

878
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:48,500
[grunts]

879
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:56,125
[footsteps]

880
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:58,541
[KAHORI] You're jogging
a lot more lately.

881
00:42:58,625 --> 00:43:00,166
[NATSUKI]
Yeah, I guess.

882
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,833
I'm aiming for a
high school in Tokyo

883
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:03,208
that's got a good track team.

884
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:05,458
[KAHORI] I'm sure you'll
get a great recommendation.

885
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,083
[NATSUKI]
Heh, we'll see.

886
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:10,125
I've just been thinking it
might be nice to get away.

887
00:43:10,208 --> 00:43:11,750
[KAHORI] You've got
practice after school?

888
00:43:11,833 --> 00:43:12,916
[NATSUKI]
Yep.

889
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,541
You staying for
a Council meeting?

890
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,250
[KAHORI]
About the cell phone ban.

891
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:18,541
Something to do with...
disciplinary actions

892
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:21,375
since not everyone's
complying yet.

893
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:23,041
[NATSUKI] If you're
practicing piano later,

894
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:24,000
maybe I'll see you after.

895
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:24,875
[KAHORI]
Yeah, sure!

896
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:26,666
I'll wait up for you.

897
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:33,083
So those two have been
hanging out a whole lot lately.

898
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:33,958
They have?

899
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:35,166
[NATSUKI sighs]

900
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:37,083
Oh crap... Hey,
I didn't mean it like that.

901
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:37,958
[coughs]

902
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:39,375
Well, it's none of my business.

903
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:40,625
[NATSUKI]
Of course not.

904
00:43:40,708 --> 00:43:43,166
[KAHORI] Hey, let's keep
this quiet at school.

905
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,708
[MR. SAITO]
What part of speech is this?

906
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:46,125
[STUDENT D]
I know, it's spoken!

907
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:47,000
[AKARI]
Geez, Toyama...

908
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:49,291
[TOYAMA]
I'm not wrong!

909
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,958
It's a prefix.

910
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:52,500
[MR. SAITO]
Yes! That's correct!

911
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:53,708
[sighs]

912
00:43:53,791 --> 00:43:54,833
[MR. SAITO] And what
comes after a prefix is?

913
00:43:54,916 --> 00:43:55,958
[TOYAMA]
Also spoken!

914
00:43:56,041 --> 00:43:57,833
[KENJI]
Are you still mad at me?

915
00:43:57,916 --> 00:44:00,333
I'm sorry I shot
you with an acorn!

916
00:44:00,416 --> 00:44:04,041
I mean it! I really
am sorry, okay?

917
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:05,625
Did it hurt that much?

918
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:07,041
[KENJI pants]

919
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:09,541
[KENJI grunting]
Wah!

920
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:11,875
Yes, it hurt a lot.

921
00:44:11,958 --> 00:44:14,416
Because you hurt me right here!

922
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,333
Huh?

923
00:44:15,416 --> 00:44:18,541
I hurt... your boob?

924
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:21,500
[growls]

925
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:24,083
Ah! Uh, oh, oh! Wai-Wait!
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

926
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:26,291
You... Agh!

927
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:29,666
[NATSUKI]
Moron!

928
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,708
[KENJI]
N-N-Natsuki!

929
00:44:31,791 --> 00:44:32,750
[grunts]

930
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:46,125
[NATSUKI] Come on...
You're never late, Kaho.

931
00:44:46,208 --> 00:44:47,750
[sighs]

932
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:48,791
Huh?

933
00:44:52,875 --> 00:44:57,666
[KAHORI humming]

934
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:01,375
[NATSUKI grunts]

935
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:06,166
[KAHORI humming]

936
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:07,208
[NATSUKI]
Hm?

937
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:10,041
[JINNO] Hey, have you
seen the Council president?

938
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:11,500
[KAHORI]
Uh... No, I haven't.

939
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:14,916
I just figured that
Soga was absent today.

940
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,750
[JINNO]
Huh. Weird.

941
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:18,958
I was sure I'd seen
her in the morning.

942
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:22,041
[KAHORI] Well, she wasn't at
our Council meeting, so...

943
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:23,625
...maybe she left early?

944
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,500
[JINNO]
Hm.

945
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:27,541
[NATSUKI gasps]

946
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:42,250
[KENJI]
Uh... Huh?

947
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:47,166
[NATSUKI screams]

948
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:56,416
[gasps]

949
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,708
What... the hell is all this?

950
00:45:58,791 --> 00:46:00,583
[YURIKO]
This... is a test.

951
00:46:00,666 --> 00:46:03,833
A test that proves whether
we are ready for the future.

952
00:46:03,916 --> 00:46:05,750
Soga has proven herself.

953
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:07,000
Huh?

954
00:46:07,083 --> 00:46:08,375
What are you talking about--

955
00:46:08,458 --> 00:46:10,625
[YURIKO] And unfortunately,
you haven't, Suzuura.

956
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:14,833
As hard as I try, I hear
nothing inside your heart.

957
00:46:14,916 --> 00:46:15,750
[NATSUKI]
Uh...

958
00:46:15,833 --> 00:46:16,291
[FAMILIAR]
Yamagiwa, please.

959
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:17,541
[NATSUKI gasps]

960
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:19,291
[FAMILIAR] You've already
said far too much.

961
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:20,791
Our mission is too important

962
00:46:20,875 --> 00:46:22,125
to jeopardize with
idle conversation.

963
00:46:22,208 --> 00:46:24,250
Okay, did that
thing just talk?!

964
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:27,875
[YURIKO] I really was hoping
that you could be one of us.

965
00:46:27,958 --> 00:46:30,291
You're such a
nice person, Suzuura.

966
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:32,916
It's just such a damn shame.

967
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,875
[NATSUKI yelps]
That hurts!

968
00:46:35,958 --> 00:46:36,666
Ow!

969
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:41,958
[NATSUKI whimpers]

970
00:46:42,041 --> 00:46:45,083
[NATSUKI screams]

971
00:46:45,166 --> 00:46:48,041
Help me, Kenji! Help me!

972
00:46:48,125 --> 00:46:49,875
Stop this, now.

973
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:53,000
[NATSUKI yelps, screams]

974
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:54,458
[YURIKO]
Mm. Hm?

975
00:46:54,541 --> 00:46:55,583
[thud]

976
00:46:55,666 --> 00:46:58,250
[NATSUKI]
Ow... What the hell?!

977
00:46:58,333 --> 00:46:59,083
[NATSUKI cries]

978
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:00,500
[FAMILIAR]
Ryoichi...

979
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:02,000
[NATSUKI groans]
That really hurt.

980
00:47:02,083 --> 00:47:02,833
[RYOICHI]
Are you okay?

981
00:47:02,916 --> 00:47:05,166
[gasps]
Huh?

982
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:07,791
[RYOICHI] It's important that
you don't talk about this.

983
00:47:07,875 --> 00:47:09,083
All right?

984
00:47:09,166 --> 00:47:11,000
[NATSUKI]
I don't even know what this is.

985
00:47:11,083 --> 00:47:12,500
And what are you?!

986
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:13,875
[RYOICHI] You're saying
I don't look human?

987
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:16,541
[NATSUKI]
I mean, you look like one, but--

988
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,958
[RYOICHI]
Ssh. Somebody is coming.

989
00:47:19,041 --> 00:47:21,708
You should go now, quickly.

990
00:47:21,791 --> 00:47:24,833
[KAHORI humming]

991
00:47:24,916 --> 00:47:27,166
[FAMILIAR]
Hmm... Very well, then.

992
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,750
For now, it's enough that the
Student Council president

993
00:47:29,833 --> 00:47:34,125
is one of us. I'm certain
this will aid our progress.

994
00:47:34,208 --> 00:47:35,500
[gasps]

995
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:38,208
[chuckles]

996
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:43,458
[KAHORI humming]

997
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:44,500
Hm?

998
00:47:53,166 --> 00:47:54,333
[sighs]

999
00:47:56,416 --> 00:47:59,125
--[RYOICHI] Hey! Harukawa!
--[KAHORI gasps]

1000
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:00,875
I'm glad I found you.

1001
00:48:02,416 --> 00:48:05,291
[RYOICHI] I... sort of...
borrowed these without asking.

1002
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,333
Thanks.

1003
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:10,833
Oh, are you going to practice
"Clair de Lune" also?

1004
00:48:10,916 --> 00:48:12,916
[KAHORI]
Um, yeah!

1005
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,875
I thought I'd try it out.

1006
00:48:16,208 --> 00:48:18,250
Then I'd like to hear it.

1007
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:19,500
Someday.

1008
00:48:21,833 --> 00:48:23,250
[KAHORI]
Mm-hm.

1009
00:48:26,208 --> 00:48:28,875
What the hell is
taking Natsuki so long?!

1010
00:48:28,958 --> 00:48:30,750
[KAHORI sighs, giggles]

1011
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:51,958
[KAHORI] I don't remember all
that much about my father.

1012
00:48:52,041 --> 00:48:53,791
He was a fisherman.

1013
00:48:53,875 --> 00:48:57,041
One night, years ago,
there was a terrible storm,

1014
00:48:57,125 --> 00:48:58,833
and he was pulled under while

1015
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:01,958
trying to rescue one
of his shipmates.

1016
00:49:02,041 --> 00:49:05,583
My mother was always
afraid of the sea after that.

1017
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:09,708
She worries so much
when I'm out swimming.

1018
00:49:09,791 --> 00:49:12,208
I think that's why coming
here is the only time

1019
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:15,958
I can feel just a
little bit... rebellious.

1020
00:49:16,041 --> 00:49:17,625
I can't believe that my father

1021
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:20,250
had ever lived in
fear of the water.

1022
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:22,958
So, I won't either.

1023
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:29,625
[KAHORI] It's like...
I can feel him here.

1024
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:34,708
[KAHORI] It's almost like
I'm speaking with him.

1025
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:44,000
[KENJI]
Whoa!

1026
00:49:44,083 --> 00:49:45,458
[KAHORI gasps]
Shiro!

1027
00:49:45,541 --> 00:49:47,625
[KENJI]
Ah! I'm sorry about him!

1028
00:49:47,708 --> 00:49:49,083
Good boy!

1029
00:49:49,166 --> 00:49:51,208
Now, how old are you, Shiro?

1030
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:52,625
He's pretty old...

1031
00:49:52,708 --> 00:49:53,916
A teenager, actually.

1032
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,375
Oh! That's pretty old for a dog!

1033
00:49:56,458 --> 00:49:59,250
Yeah, he's been around
as long as I remember.

1034
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:01,416
Well, he certainly
doesn't show his age.

1035
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,333
Yeah. I wonder how he does it.

1036
00:50:06,041 --> 00:50:08,333
Uh, by the way, Harukawa...

1037
00:50:08,416 --> 00:50:10,125
Have you seen Natsuki lately?

1038
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:11,541
[KAHORI]
Mm-mm.

1039
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:13,708
I haven't seen her
at school for days.

1040
00:50:13,791 --> 00:50:14,708
Oh...

1041
00:50:14,791 --> 00:50:15,750
[KAHORI]
You heard anything?

1042
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:18,833
No... She won't answer her cell.

1043
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:21,708
Really? Same with me.

1044
00:50:21,791 --> 00:50:23,333
I'm a little worried.

1045
00:50:23,416 --> 00:50:24,375
[KENJI]
Hm.

1046
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:27,750
[KAHORI] Guess her perfect
attendance is shot.

1047
00:50:27,833 --> 00:50:30,041
She... told you
about her record?

1048
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:32,041
[KAHORI]
Yeah... She was proud of it.

1049
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:34,458
I guess that leaves
the honor to me!

1050
00:50:34,541 --> 00:50:36,208
[KAHORI]
You've never missed a day?

1051
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:38,833
Tardiness... is another matter.

1052
00:50:38,916 --> 00:50:41,041
[KAHORI]
Oh...

1053
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:42,083
[gasps]

1054
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,916
Uh... Harukawa?

1055
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:46,833
Yeah?

1056
00:50:46,916 --> 00:50:49,083
[KENJI]
Are you thinking of...

1057
00:50:49,166 --> 00:50:51,958
...maybe dating... anyone?

1058
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,458
[KAHORI]
Huh...?

1059
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:04,750
[bike rattles]

1060
00:51:04,833 --> 00:51:05,791
[KENJI groans]

1061
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:09,208
[cat meows]

1062
00:51:12,916 --> 00:51:15,416
[SOGA] The policy bans not
only the use of cell phones,

1063
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,041
but their possession on
school grounds as well.

1064
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:21,291
Despite this, many students
continue to bring them in.

1065
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:23,041
They aren't respecting the rule.

1066
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:25,583
So obviously,
the penalty for breaking it

1067
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:28,041
needs to be much more severe.

1068
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:30,833
I feel, the Student
Council should propose...

1069
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:31,958
[JINNO]
...suspension?!

1070
00:51:32,041 --> 00:51:34,333
That's pretty harsh, isn't it?!

1071
00:51:34,416 --> 00:51:36,291
Not for disobeying
school policy.

1072
00:51:36,375 --> 00:51:39,041
I get that students are
supposed to obey the rules,

1073
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:40,458
but what gives us the right

1074
00:51:40,541 --> 00:51:42,625
to hand out that
kind of punishment?!

1075
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:44,750
[AMANO] I think we
could actually do this.

1076
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:47,166
Article 10, Supplement
number 2 says:

1077
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:50,208
"The Student Council may propose
new school policy measures

1078
00:51:50,291 --> 00:51:51,958
when deemed necessary.

1079
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:56,583
Such policies are effective
upon student body approval."

1080
00:51:56,666 --> 00:51:58,833
[JINNO]
Even so, they'd never agree.

1081
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:01,208
[SOGA] It also says that
in cases of emergency,

1082
00:52:01,291 --> 00:52:03,791
approval by the student
body may be circumvented.

1083
00:52:03,875 --> 00:52:06,541
[JINNO] But our advisor
would never okay that!

1084
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:08,750
[SOGA] Mr. Yamada happens
to be out on sick leave

1085
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:09,958
until further notice.

1086
00:52:10,041 --> 00:52:11,500
[KAHORI]
Huh?!

1087
00:52:11,583 --> 00:52:12,750
[AMANO] Then approval from a
faculty advisor isn't needed.

1088
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:14,250
This doesn't make sense!

1089
00:52:14,333 --> 00:52:16,208
Mr. Yamada was
just fine yesterday!

1090
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:18,666
So then what the hell
happened to him?!

1091
00:52:20,708 --> 00:52:22,541
We should all put
this to a vote.

1092
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:23,416
[gasps]

1093
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,833
W-Wait! We've barely discussed--

1094
00:52:24,916 --> 00:52:28,041
All in favor, raise your hand.

1095
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:30,791
[JINNO] There's no way a
majority of us would agree to--

1096
00:52:30,875 --> 00:52:31,958
[KAHORI gasps]

1097
00:52:32,041 --> 00:52:34,583
[KONDO cries]

00:52:34,666 --> 00:52:35,833
[JINNO]
The hell...?

1099
00:52:35,916 --> 00:52:38,000
[AMANO] It looks like
we have the majority.

1100
00:52:39,916 --> 00:52:42,166
What's the matter?

1101
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:44,416
[JINNO]
Hm...

1102
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,416
The policy has been approved
by the Student Council.

1103
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,166
[crying continues]

1104
00:52:51,666 --> 00:52:53,708
[KAHORI gasps]
What's going on with them?!

1105
00:52:53,791 --> 00:52:54,958
[JINNO]
No clue!

1106
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:56,750
[KAHORI] I mean, why are
the rest of the Council

1107
00:52:56,833 --> 00:52:58,791
acting like completely different
people all of a sudden?!

1108
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:00,625
I know just as much as you do!

1109
00:53:00,708 --> 00:53:02,625
[gasps]

1110
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:05,208
[gasps]
I'm sorry...

1111
00:53:05,291 --> 00:53:08,791
It's just that...
it seems like...

1112
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:11,041
Like it isn't just
the Student Council

1113
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:13,833
who have been acting
so unusual lately.

1114
00:53:13,916 --> 00:53:17,125
So many opinions are
changing all of a sudden.

1115
00:53:17,208 --> 00:53:19,500
One student after another.

1116
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:21,125
Constantly, now.

1117
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:24,291
You know, it's not just Mr.
Yamada who's suddenly taken off.

1118
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:26,500
A bunch of students
are out also.

1119
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:29,166
--Twenty-three, so far.
--What?

1120
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:31,250
And it's making me nervous,

1121
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:35,291
especially since not one of them
is even returning my calls.

1122
00:53:35,375 --> 00:53:37,208
I think people were
glued to their phones

1123
00:53:37,291 --> 00:53:40,041
'cause they were
afraid of being isolated.

1124
00:53:40,125 --> 00:53:43,125
School can feel pretty
lonely sometimes.

1125
00:53:43,208 --> 00:53:44,541
But the ones who've changed

1126
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:46,958
don't seem to feel
that way anymore.

1127
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:49,291
Almost like they can just--

1128
00:53:49,375 --> 00:53:50,875
--[KAHORI gasps]
--[JINNO] Sorry.

1129
00:53:50,958 --> 00:53:52,375
You'd just think
that I'm the one

1130
00:53:52,458 --> 00:53:54,125
who's turned into
someone else.

1131
00:53:54,208 --> 00:53:56,500
Please, tell me what you think!

1132
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:00,583
It's like the ones
who've changed can...

1133
00:54:00,666 --> 00:54:02,666
...speak without words.

1134
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:05,083
Huh?

1135
00:54:05,166 --> 00:54:07,541
[JINNO]
I know telepathy sounds crazy,

1136
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:09,791
but isn't that how
it seems to you?

1137
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:11,083
[KAHORI]
Um...

1138
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:16,041
Maybe we should check in on
Mr. Yamada after school today.

1139
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:17,541
Don't you think so?

1140
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:20,458
[JINNO] Yeah, I'm starting to
get worried about him now.

1141
00:54:20,541 --> 00:54:23,125
I'll run home and grab my
cell phone before we meet up.

1142
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:25,375
What's your number?

1143
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:26,583
[KAHORI]
Actually, I...

1144
00:54:26,666 --> 00:54:27,958
[JINNO]
Hm?

1145
00:54:28,041 --> 00:54:30,958
[KAHORI] I kind of... uh...
don't have a cell phone.

1146
00:54:35,458 --> 00:54:38,250
[phone ringing]

1147
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:41,250
[KENJI] Goddammit, Natsuki!
Just answer your phone!

1148
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:43,666
At least take your pillow back!

1149
00:54:45,375 --> 00:54:46,750
[YURIKO]
Are you waiting for someone?

1150
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:49,250
[KAHORI]
Hm? Yeah, I am.

1151
00:54:49,333 --> 00:54:50,375
[YURIKO]
Then, would it be all right

1152
00:54:50,458 --> 00:54:52,000
if I waited out here with you?

1153
00:54:52,083 --> 00:54:54,916
Oh, sure! Don't even
worry about it!

1154
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,500
All right.

1155
00:54:56,583 --> 00:54:58,291
Thanks, Harukawa.

1156
00:55:02,458 --> 00:55:03,958
[YURIKO]
You know...

1157
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:06,458
I think that we'd be better off
without cell phones altogether.

1158
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:07,541
[KAHORI]
Hm?

1159
00:55:07,625 --> 00:55:09,583
[YURIKO]
They can cause so much trouble.

1160
00:55:09,666 --> 00:55:12,666
They can poison the air
between you and other people.

1161
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:15,000
They're flawed...
if you think about it.

1162
00:55:15,083 --> 00:55:17,916
[KAHORI]
Cell phones you mean?

1163
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,875
[YURIKO]
Yeah. It's pretty ridiculous.

1164
00:55:20,958 --> 00:55:22,666
These little devices trick you

1165
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:24,750
into believing that
you're never alone,

1166
00:55:24,833 --> 00:55:27,333
that you're actually
connected with other people...

1167
00:55:27,416 --> 00:55:29,833
...when all you're really doing
is avoiding the entire world.

1168
00:55:29,916 --> 00:55:31,708
[KAHORI]
Huh. Mm-hm.

1169
00:55:31,791 --> 00:55:34,000
[YURIKO]
All this... when there's already

1170
00:55:34,083 --> 00:55:36,833
a flawless communication
with each other.

1171
00:55:44,583 --> 00:55:46,666
[YURIKO]
I wanted to warn you, Harukawa.

1172
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,125
It's only fair.

1173
00:55:48,208 --> 00:55:49,625
[KAHORI]
Warn me?

1174
00:55:49,708 --> 00:55:50,708
[YURIKO]
Yes.

1175
00:55:50,791 --> 00:55:52,625
Stonewalling the
Council like this

1176
00:55:52,708 --> 00:55:54,875
isn't going to
help out anybody.

1177
00:55:54,958 --> 00:55:55,750
Not in the end.

1178
00:55:55,833 --> 00:55:56,833
[KAHORI]
Huh?

1179
00:55:56,916 --> 00:56:00,125
[YURIKO]
Jinno, right? The Council VP?

1180
00:56:00,208 --> 00:56:02,458
It's a shame that he couldn't
make your little date today.

1181
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:05,375
[gasps]
What did you do to him?

1182
00:56:05,458 --> 00:56:06,875
I hear he's moved.

1183
00:56:06,958 --> 00:56:08,250
[gasps]

1184
00:56:08,333 --> 00:56:10,875
[YURIKO] Everyone is better
off without cell phones

1185
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:12,875
because it's only without them

1186
00:56:12,958 --> 00:56:15,666
that people will look for
what we've already found.

1187
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:17,666
Honestly, wouldn't
you love to know

1188
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:19,500
what people are really thinking?

1189
00:56:19,583 --> 00:56:22,166
What they feel,
not what they say.

1190
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:25,291
[YURIKO] Just think of
how lonely it can be

1191
00:56:25,375 --> 00:56:28,041
when you can't understand
how someone feels,

1192
00:56:28,125 --> 00:56:31,666
or when you're not able to make
someone else understand you.

1193
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:36,125
[KAHORI] Yamagiwa, what are
you saying we should do?

1194
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:37,916
[YURIKO]
We should be reborn,

1195
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,333
if we're able to.

1196
00:56:39,416 --> 00:56:41,500
Then we should gain
the ability to survive

1197
00:56:41,583 --> 00:56:43,791
in the world that's coming.

1198
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:45,916
He told us about it himself.

1199
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,041
[KAHORI]
Who did?

1200
00:56:47,125 --> 00:56:48,958
You aren't talking about--

1201
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:54,666
[YURIKO]
Do you want to try?

1202
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:56,541
Maybe you'll belong.

1203
00:56:58,166 --> 00:56:59,625
[KAHORI]
Try what?

1204
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:01,083
I-I don't get it.

1205
00:57:01,166 --> 00:57:02,791
[YURIKO]
Just look at these soap bubbles.

1206
00:57:02,875 --> 00:57:05,250
--[KAHORI] The soap bubbles?
--[KENJI growls]

1207
00:57:05,333 --> 00:57:06,833
[YURIKO]
Yeah, look.

1208
00:57:06,916 --> 00:57:09,875
Each and every one of them is
a whole world unto themselves.

1209
00:57:09,958 --> 00:57:12,875
Hm. Take a look,
and you can see them,

1210
00:57:12,958 --> 00:57:15,500
all of these different
worlds on the inside.

1211
00:57:15,583 --> 00:57:17,791
And each of these
worlds, unfortunately,

1212
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:20,458
are isolated from one another.

1213
00:57:20,541 --> 00:57:22,208
I think that's sounds lonely.

1214
00:57:22,291 --> 00:57:23,333
All that we want...

1215
00:57:23,416 --> 00:57:26,000
...is for them to be connected,

1216
00:57:26,083 --> 00:57:28,916
so that they
aren't alone anymore.

1217
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,333
[KAHORI gasps]

1218
00:57:30,416 --> 00:57:31,666
[KAHORI]
But they popped.

1219
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,083
[YURIKO]
Some will pop.

1220
00:57:33,166 --> 00:57:35,000
But some will join.

1221
00:57:35,083 --> 00:57:37,541
So there's a test,
to learn which one you are.

1222
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:38,625
[KAHORI]
What?

And we're really sure
that boy has our ability?

1243

He didn't respond to
my inner voice at all.

1244
00:58:47,416 --> 00:58:50,583
[YURIKO] Still though,
but he did come here for her.

1245
00:58:50,666 --> 00:58:51,791
There's something there...

1246

[SOGA] Maybe Harukawa
reached out to him.

[FAMILIAR]
No, it wasn't her.

1248
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:59,916
He's one of us, but his
full power is sealed.

1249
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,375
And I'm fairly certain
as to who did it,

1250
00:59:02,458 --> 00:59:03,791
and for what reason.

[gate rattles]

1252
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,958
[KENJI] Huh? Sorry,
I was... holding your hand.

1253
00:59:08,916 --> 00:59:11,833
[KENJI]
Huh? Ssh! Ssh!

1254
00:59:11,916 --> 00:59:12,750
[KENJI'S GRANDPA]
Hm?

1255
00:59:12,833 --> 00:59:14,541
Oh! Well, hello, you two!

1256
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:16,500
--[KENJI] Ssh! Grandpa, ssh!
--[KENJI'S GRANDPA] Huh?

1257
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:17,750
If it's all right with you,

1258
00:59:17,833 --> 00:59:19,625
I think we should
talk more inside.

1259
00:59:19,708 --> 00:59:22,166
My room is right at the
top of the stairs, okay?

1260
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:25,083
[KENJI] Oh, I'll get
something to drink--

1261
00:59:25,166 --> 00:59:25,708
[crash]

1262
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:26,916
[KENJI]
Ow!

1263
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,333
--Come on, come on. Iced tea...
--[clanging]

1264
00:59:28,416 --> 00:59:29,708
[KENJI]
Ow! That still hurts!

1265
00:59:29,791 --> 00:59:33,208
[rattling]

1266
00:59:33,291 --> 00:59:34,541
[KAHORI]
Hm?

1267
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:37,958
[gasps]

1268
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:47,041
[gasps]

1269
00:59:48,083 --> 00:59:49,041
[NATSUKI]
Huh?

1270
01:00:01,791 --> 01:00:06,458
[KAHORI gasping]

1271
01:00:06,541 --> 01:00:07,958
--[NATSUKI] Huh...?
--[KAHORI whimpers]

1272
01:00:08,041 --> 01:00:09,625
[gasps]

1273
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:11,166
No! No! Uh...

1274
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:13,125
--I... I'm sorry to intrude.
--[NATSUKI] This isn't what

1275
01:00:13,208 --> 01:00:14,666
it looks like, I swear!
Please, K-Kaho!

1276
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:15,833
[KENJI'S SISTER sighs]

1277
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:18,250
[NATSUKI]
Just wait a second, will you?!

1278
01:00:18,333 --> 01:00:20,750
Oh my god! You had me startled!

1279
01:00:20,833 --> 01:00:22,000
[sighs]

1280
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:23,458
I wasn't expecting
that either...

1281
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:24,833
[KENJI]
Natsuki, you shouldn't climb in

1282
01:00:24,916 --> 01:00:27,416
from the roof like that.
It's too dangerous.

1283
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,666
[NATSUKI]
Dangerous?!

1284
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,333
You nearly took me out
with a freakin' acorn!

1285
01:00:30,416 --> 01:00:32,041
[KENJI]
And you... broke your leg

1286
01:00:32,125 --> 01:00:33,291
making that climb
when we were little!

1287
01:00:33,375 --> 01:00:34,708
[NATSUKI]
That was you, genius!

1288
01:00:34,791 --> 01:00:35,458
[KAHORI chuckles]

1289
01:00:35,541 --> 01:00:36,208
[KENJI]
Oh... Was it?

1290
01:00:36,291 --> 01:00:37,458
Yes! It was!

1291
01:00:37,541 --> 01:00:39,208
We were talking on the
string phone and you--

1292
01:00:39,291 --> 01:00:42,500
--[KAHORI laughs]
--[NATSUKI] Huh?

1293
01:00:42,583 --> 01:00:44,958
[KAHORI] This room feels
like a whole other world

1294
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:46,958
compared to that mess earlier.

1295
01:00:47,041 --> 01:00:49,708
I still don't know just
what to make of it all.

1296
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:52,125
Are you feeling any better now?

1297
01:00:52,208 --> 01:00:54,750
Yeah, thanks.
I'm not scared anymore.

1298
01:00:54,833 --> 01:00:56,250
Scared of what?

1299
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:58,041
Did that transfer student try
something with you, too--

1300
01:00:58,125 --> 01:01:00,125
[gasps]

1301
01:01:00,208 --> 01:01:01,583
[KENJI]
Huh...?

1302
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,166
[KENJI]
What did Kyogoku do to you?

1303
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:08,458
Nevermind, it's nothing.

1304
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:09,958
[KENJI]
It's not nothing.

1305
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:11,833
This is the reason you've
been skipping school, isn't it?

1306
01:01:11,916 --> 01:01:12,791
[NATSUKI]
I said, it's nothing!

1307
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:14,500
[KAHORI]
I knew it!

1308
01:01:14,583 --> 01:01:15,750
[KENJI gasps]

1309
01:01:15,833 --> 01:01:18,208
Kyogoku... I knew he had
something to do with...

1310
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:20,875
...w-whatever's been
happening at school.

1311
01:01:22,708 --> 01:01:24,500
[KAHORI]
Natsuki, please...

1312
01:01:24,583 --> 01:01:26,250
I-I wanna understand
whatever it is

1313
01:01:26,333 --> 01:01:28,750
that he's trying to
do to all of us.

1314
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:30,416
[KENJI]
Uh...

1315
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,833
Please tell me, Natsuki.

1316
01:01:32,916 --> 01:01:34,875
What is he doing?

1317
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:38,583
[NATSUKI whimpers]

1318
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:53,250
[RYOICHI chuckles]

1319
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:56,625
[KENJI'S GRANDPA]
Huh...

1320
01:01:56,708 --> 01:01:58,458
[KENJI]
But of course!

1321
01:01:58,541 --> 01:02:00,416
So, the mystery unfolds.

1322
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,375
[KAHORI]
Hm?

1323
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:03,500
[KENJI]
Hm...

1324
01:02:03,583 --> 01:02:04,166
So this means--

1325
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:05,375
[groans]

1326
01:02:05,458 --> 01:02:07,375
[KENJI] I haven't said
anything dumb yet!

1327
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:09,166
[NATSUKI]
No, but you were about to!

1328
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:11,958
I read your mind, and it told
me that you're a big moron!

1329
01:02:12,041 --> 01:02:13,583
[KENJI] I thought they said
you didn't have any...

1330
01:02:13,666 --> 01:02:15,083
...super powers or whatever.

1331
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:17,291
[NATSUKI] Yet I can still
tell that you're a moron.

1332
01:02:17,375 --> 01:02:18,958
Ooh! How 'bout that?

1333
01:02:19,041 --> 01:02:20,583
[giggles]

1334
01:02:20,666 --> 01:02:22,000
[NATSUKI]
It's getting late.

1335
01:02:22,083 --> 01:02:24,458
I really should start
heading home.

1336
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:26,833
Are you sure it's safe to
go out because you can--

1337
01:02:26,916 --> 01:02:29,208
You are not going to make
her stay in your bedroom!

1338
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:31,666
Thank you,
but I'll be just fine.

1339
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:33,416
I'm glad you're okay, Natsuki.

1340
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,666
Well, I'll walk you home.

1341
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:35,500
Uh... Me too!

1342
01:02:35,583 --> 01:02:37,333
Huh? What, in your pajamas?

1343
01:02:37,416 --> 01:02:39,958
Five minutes!
Gimme five minutes!

1344
01:02:40,041 --> 01:02:42,333
[KENJI] We've recently talked
about you not doing that!

1345
01:02:42,416 --> 01:02:43,666
And you forgot
your pillow again!

1346
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:44,958
[NATSUKI]
Ta-da!

1347
01:02:46,541 --> 01:02:48,666
[sighs]

1348
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:16,208
[NATSUKI] I'm glad I
finally talked to you guys.

1349
01:03:16,291 --> 01:03:19,125
I really need to
vent more often.

1350
01:03:19,208 --> 01:03:21,333
[KENJI] What? You're like
always venting.

1351
01:03:21,416 --> 01:03:22,416
[NATSUKI]
I am not!

1352
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,125
Don't you pay any attention?

1353
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:26,208
[KENJI]
Fine, then vent more.

1354
01:03:29,541 --> 01:03:30,708
All right, if you say so.

1355
01:03:30,791 --> 01:03:32,291
But I don't want to
be held responsible

1356
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,208
for any future venting.

1357
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:35,541
[KENJI]
Huh?

1358
01:03:39,041 --> 01:03:41,083
[KENJI]
Hey, Natsuki...

1359
01:03:41,166 --> 01:03:42,166
[NATSUKI]
Hm?

1360
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:44,375
[KENJI]
Will you come back to school?

1361
01:03:44,458 --> 01:03:46,875
I have no idea how
Kyogoku and the others

1362
01:03:46,958 --> 01:03:50,500
are trying to change
things for everyone.

1363
01:03:50,583 --> 01:03:54,958
I'd rather that stuff
just stays normal.

1364
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:58,791
And... what's most normal
is us staying friends, right?

1365
01:04:01,541 --> 01:04:03,500
[NATSUKI]
Please don't say that to me.

1366
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,083
[KENJI]
Huh?

1367
01:04:05,166 --> 01:04:07,375
Just don't say that to me!

1368
01:04:11,833 --> 01:04:13,083
Natsuki...?

1369
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:19,208
Sorry!

1370
01:04:19,291 --> 01:04:21,833
I was just worried is all.

1371
01:04:21,916 --> 01:04:23,166
[NATSUKI]
Moron...

1372
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:24,416
[KENJI]
Huh?

1373
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,291
[NATSUKI] Come on,
when're you gonna tell me

1374
01:04:26,375 --> 01:04:27,958
how Kaho turned you down?

1375
01:04:28,041 --> 01:04:30,458
W-What are you talking about?!
Where's this coming from?

1376
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:31,416
[NATSUKI]
Answer me.

1377
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,916
And I'll come back to school.

1378
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,208
[KENJI]
Uh...

1379
01:04:35,291 --> 01:04:37,500
[KENJI groans]
Okay, fine!

1380
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:39,250
If you're gonna be a baby...

1381
01:04:42,666 --> 01:04:44,916
[KAHORI sighs]

1382
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,125
[KAHORI]
Mm...

1383
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,333
[KENJI grunts]

1384
01:04:49,416 --> 01:04:50,375
[KENJI]
Hm?

1385
01:04:50,458 --> 01:04:52,416
Huh?

1386
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:56,750
[gasps]

1387
01:04:56,833 --> 01:04:59,375
[whimpers]

1388
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:01,166
Hey, are you all right, Seki?

1389
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:02,125
[NATSUKI laughs]

1390
01:05:02,208 --> 01:05:02,916
[KAHORI]
Uh... Seki?

1391
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,583
[laughing continues]

1392
01:05:04,666 --> 01:05:06,750
[NATSUKI]
Mr. Open Zipper returns!

1393
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:09,000
[KENJI] Now you've gotta
come back to school, okay?

1394
01:05:11,625 --> 01:05:14,875
[KENJI] Bring your phone with
you if you're still worried.

1395
01:05:14,958 --> 01:05:17,250
I'm gonna bring in mine,
too, all right?

1396
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:20,458
[sighs]

1397
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:22,250
[gasps]

1398
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:24,541
N-Natsuki, what are you--

1399
01:05:43,166 --> 01:05:43,875
[giggles]

1400
01:05:43,958 --> 01:05:45,583
There, I vented.

1401
01:05:45,666 --> 01:05:46,666
You moron.

1402
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:48,083
[KENJI gasps]

1403
01:05:48,166 --> 01:05:50,750
[NATSUKI]
I do understand, Kenji...

1404
01:05:50,833 --> 01:05:53,666
Liking someone who
likes someone else,

1405
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:57,666
knowing that they just don't
understand how you feel...

1406

1409

Correct, it's school policy.

1418

get suspended, too, then?

Mr. Vice Principal? What's the--

1423

[VICE PRINCIPAL] Just a moment,
and in private, Mr. Saito.

[KAHORI yelps, laughs]

[KAHORI]
And morning, Natsuki.

1426
01:07:14,041 --> 01:07:15,041
[AMANO]
I think each offender needs

1427
01:07:15,125 --> 01:07:16,500
the penalty to be
clearly explained.

1428
01:07:16,583 --> 01:07:17,666
[YURIKO]
I'm disappointed to hear that

1429
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:19,541
you've ignored
my warning, Harukawa.

[KAHORI gasps]

We had held back.

1432
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:25,916
Because he really does seem
to like both you and Seki.

1433
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,250
Though I can't see why
that should interfere.

1434
01:07:28,333 --> 01:07:31,416
[KAHORI] What did you
do to Jinno and Kondo?

1435
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,416
[YURIKO]
Aren't they both absent?

1436
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,291
That's why we've decided to
help out on the Student Council.

were smart enough to

01:07:46,458 --> 01:07:48,875
try helping us in
whatever way you're able.

1443
01:07:48,958 --> 01:07:52,541
So many who don't share our
abilities want to cooperate.

1444
01:07:52,625 --> 01:07:54,333
Like the Vice Principal...

1445

He's been more than
understanding with our cause.

[KAHORI sighs]

to make this school a
better place for everyone.

to ask you about, all right?

In the future...

Everybody has been forced to
leave the entire Earth behind.

1503
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:43,291
[KAHORI]
What?

1504
01:10:43,375 --> 01:10:45,375
[RYOICHI] We'd spent
too long living in a way

1505
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:48,875
that the planet just
wasn't able to endure.

1506
01:10:48,958 --> 01:10:52,458
We'd made the Earth...
uninhabitable.

1507
01:10:52,541 --> 01:10:55,666
So, we took refuge on the moon.

1508
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:59,333
Look, up there is my real home.

1509
01:10:59,416 --> 01:11:01,708
I can't get over how
strange it feels.

1510
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:03,125
I never thought
I'd have a chance

1511
01:11:03,208 --> 01:11:07,000
to look up at the moon
from down on the Earth.

1512
01:11:07,083 --> 01:11:09,291
Things happen so fast...

1513
01:11:09,375 --> 01:11:11,833
...without any warning.

1514
01:11:11,916 --> 01:11:13,500
The only ship to
survive was the one

1515
01:11:13,583 --> 01:11:16,833
that had already left the Earth.

1516
01:11:16,916 --> 01:11:19,208
Then we learned that it
would take a thousand years

1517
01:11:19,291 --> 01:11:22,250
for the Earth to
become livable again.

1518
01:11:22,333 --> 01:11:24,083
We didn't have the technology

1519
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:27,000
or the resources
to survive that long.

1520
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:30,208
What remained of us...
were doomed.

1521
01:11:30,291 --> 01:11:33,916
We can never return... ever.

1522
01:11:38,291 --> 01:11:41,791
[RYOICHI] But as time went on...
there were certain children

1523
01:11:41,875 --> 01:11:44,625
who began to
show certain abilities.

1524
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:46,916
[KAHORI]
And those were psychics?

1525
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,708
[RYOICHI] Yeah, some would
decide to put it that way.

1526
01:11:51,083 --> 01:11:52,500
[RYOICHI] 
Those same people would say that

1527
01:11:52,583 --> 01:11:55,833
we'd never taken full
advantage of the brain.

1528
01:11:55,916 --> 01:11:57,750
And faced with extinction,

1529
01:11:57,833 --> 01:12:00,833
it made sense for
latent abilities to appear.

1530
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:03,666
At least, that's what
some believed.

1531
01:12:06,125 --> 01:12:09,083
[RYOICHI] But no one
really knows for sure.

1532
01:12:09,166 --> 01:12:13,541
Even so, in my era, it's the
only ray of hope we have left.

1533
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:14,750
[KAHORI]
It is?

1534
01:12:14,833 --> 01:12:15,750
[RYOICHI]
Yeah.

1535
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:17,291
I don't think anyone
could accept

1536
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:20,083
just sitting around
and waiting for the end.

1537
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:23,875
I think we needed hope
to keep on living.

1538
01:12:23,958 --> 01:12:25,625
[NATSUKI]
Uh... Hey!

1539
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:30,125
[RYOICHI] The ability seems to
manifest around the age of 14.

1540
01:12:30,208 --> 01:12:31,750
Maybe that's because that's when

1541
01:12:31,833 --> 01:12:34,583
we start feeling doubt,
and confusion, and shame

1542
01:12:34,666 --> 01:12:36,416
in our relationships
with others.

1543
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,625
[NATSUKI, KENJI chattering]

1544
01:12:38,708 --> 01:12:41,083
[RYOICHI]
Maybe that's what triggers it?

1545
01:12:41,166 --> 01:12:43,583
Some say this ability
comes as a defense...

1546
01:12:43,666 --> 01:12:45,333
...to prevent conflict.

1547
01:12:45,416 --> 01:12:47,333
So, my mission is
to awaken those

1548
01:12:47,416 --> 01:12:49,458
with latent
abilities in this era,

1549
01:12:49,541 --> 01:12:52,333
as many as possible.

1550
01:12:52,416 --> 01:12:54,166
If what they say is true,

1551
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:57,458
maybe we can prevent
that disaster.

1552
01:12:57,541 --> 01:12:59,791
And if I fail,
I'll take all those

1553
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:02,208
that I've awakened
back to my era.

[gasps]

1555
01:13:03,666 --> 01:13:05,250
[RYOICHI] After all,
there aren't very many people

1556
01:13:05,333 --> 01:13:08,083
who are left in my
time to begin with.

1557
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:11,958
And fewer still
who have the ability.

1558
01:13:12,041 --> 01:13:16,083
I won't let anyone get
in the way... No one.

I wonder...

put a magic spell on myself.

I'm gonna count down from three.

1580

After that, you will reawaken

it would never be broken.

[RYOICHI] My mother was
born here, in this era.

1589

I don't have any memory of her.

not long after I was born.

to dwell on the past.

He only ever looks
to the future.

Looking at them and trying
to form an image of her

1597
01:15:43,833 --> 01:15:45,916

While you're at it,

why not also ban the rest

[NATSUKI]
Why even ask?

1650
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:50,125
You just want to prop me up
here and pass judgement.

1651
01:17:50,208 --> 01:17:53,208
So you can read minds.
You think that makes you better?

You're a bunch of

ever really know?!

01:20:46,333 --> 01:20:47,916
Make it your home?

1715
01:20:51,416 --> 01:20:52,791
[KENJI sighs]

1716
01:20:54,708 --> 01:20:56,958
I can only guess that
people are happiest

1717
01:20:57,041 --> 01:21:00,333
living in the era that they
were actually born into.

1718
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:04,708
And I'm assuming that you feel
the exact same way as me, right?

1719
01:21:06,041 --> 01:21:08,125
I suppose so...

1720
01:21:08,208 --> 01:21:10,666
[KENJI'S GRANDPS chuckles]
It was a silly question,

1721
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:12,166
wasn't it?

1722
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,875
[NATSUKI]
Uh...

1723
01:21:16,958 --> 01:21:17,750
Huh?

1724
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:19,333
[KENJI chuckles]

1725
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:21,791
[NATSUKI sighs]

1726
01:21:21,875 --> 01:21:23,291
[gasps]

1727
01:21:23,375 --> 01:21:25,083
[NATSUKI]
No way am I touching your phone!

1728
01:21:25,166 --> 01:21:26,666
[AMANO groans]

1729
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:28,333
[NATSUKI]
Where will you even keep it?!

1730
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:29,500
[KENJI]
Where do you think?

1731
01:21:29,583 --> 01:21:30,708
This swimsuit is all
I've got right now.

1732
01:21:30,791 --> 01:21:32,291
[NATSUKI] Then I'm
definitely holding mine!

1733
01:21:32,375 --> 01:21:34,166
[KENJI] All right...
What's the big deal?

1734
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:36,916
Your swimsuit is not
a pocket, you freak show!

1735
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,541
[laughs]

1736
01:21:38,625 --> 01:21:40,416
[BOTH]
Huh?

1737
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:44,916
Like I said, you really
are a psychic, huh?

1738
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,166
[KENJI chuckles]
I guess you were right.

1739
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:50,625
[RYOICHI]
Then let's finish this.

1740
01:21:50,708 --> 01:21:53,666
We decide how
this ends, don't we?

1741
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:55,333
[NATSUKI gasps]

1742
01:21:55,416 --> 01:21:57,250
Oh! Uh, hey, Kyogoku!

1743
01:21:57,333 --> 01:21:58,125
[RYOICHI]
Hm?

1744
01:21:58,208 --> 01:21:59,666
[KENJI]
Tomorrow's Saturday.

1745
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:01,791
Huh?

1746
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:02,500
[NATSUKI]
Huh?

1747
01:22:02,583 --> 01:22:03,375
[RYOICHI]
Okay...?

1748
01:22:03,458 --> 01:22:04,875
Then let's all go to the beach!

1749
01:22:04,958 --> 01:22:05,625
[NATSUKI]
Huh?!

1750
01:22:05,708 --> 01:22:06,541
[RYOICHI]
Huh...?

1751
01:22:06,625 --> 01:22:08,208
[BOTH gasp]

1752
01:22:11,458 --> 01:22:12,625
[RYOICHI]
What...?

1753
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,750
[WEATHERMAN] The typhoon
that developed on the 4th

1754
01:22:21,833 --> 01:22:24,291
continues to punish
the Ogasawara Islands,

1755
01:22:24,375 --> 01:22:26,208
now southeast to Chichijima

1756
01:22:26,291 --> 01:22:29,458
and moving northeast
at about 200km/hr,

1757
01:22:29,541 --> 01:22:33,250
causing strong wind as well as
a drop in absolute pressure.

1758
01:22:35,833 --> 01:22:38,291
[NATSUKI] So you really won't
admit this was a bust, huh?

1759
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:39,833
[KENJI]
Hm? Why?

1760
01:22:39,916 --> 01:22:41,083
[NATSUKI]
Because the weather

1761
01:22:41,166 --> 01:22:43,333
has extremely different
plans from you today.

1762
01:22:43,416 --> 01:22:44,833
[KENJI]
But it's summertime!

1763
01:22:44,916 --> 01:22:46,208
[NATSUKI]
You're missing the point!

1764
01:22:46,291 --> 01:22:46,958
[KAHORI laughs]

1765
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:49,583
It is summer.

1766
01:22:49,666 --> 01:22:51,000
[sighs]

1767
01:22:51,083 --> 01:22:53,541
Fine, then I'm the bad guy here,
not the damn typhoon.

1768
01:22:53,625 --> 01:22:55,875
Don't worry, it's gonna
let up eventually.

1769
01:22:55,958 --> 01:22:57,541
Sure, the weather maybe,

1770
01:22:57,625 --> 01:22:59,250
but Kenji will be
as stubborn as ever.

1771
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:01,000
[KAHORI] Oh, hey!
I brought the scripts with me.

1772
01:23:01,083 --> 01:23:03,291
[NATSUKI gasps]
For... For the school play?!

1773
01:23:03,375 --> 01:23:04,708
[RYOICHI]
Great, we should practice.

1774
01:23:04,791 --> 01:23:05,875
--[NATSUKI] Right now?!
--[KENJI] Yeah! Nice!

1775
01:23:05,958 --> 01:23:06,958
[KAHORI]
I brought some lunch.

1776
01:23:07,041 --> 01:23:08,625
Should we eat before or after?

1777
01:23:08,708 --> 01:23:11,125
[NATSUKI] So all of us are
ignoring the typhoon then?

1778
01:23:11,208 --> 01:23:12,125
Lunch! Let's eat first!

1779
01:23:12,208 --> 01:23:13,958
And Suzuura made yours herself.

1780
01:23:14,041 --> 01:23:15,500
--[NATSUKI] Uh...
--[KENJI] Oh... Really?

1781
01:23:15,583 --> 01:23:18,166
[RYOICHI] Come on,
Seki, don't be rude.

1782
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:19,875
Then I'll try not to pass out...

1783
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:21,291
[NATSUKI]
My food's not the reason

1784
01:23:21,375 --> 01:23:22,708
you'll lose consciousness.

1785
01:23:22,791 --> 01:23:24,000
Uh... Maybe I shouldn't have--

1786
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:26,708
Hey! Let's all eat together!

1787
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:35,500
[RYOICHI, KENJI gasp]

1788
01:23:35,583 --> 01:23:36,500
[KAHORI screams]

1789
01:23:36,583 --> 01:23:37,791
[NATSUKI]
It can't be that ba--

1790
01:23:37,875 --> 01:23:40,500
[NATSUKI groans]

1791
01:23:40,583 --> 01:23:42,541
[KAHORI screaming]

1792
01:24:00,833 --> 01:24:02,958
[KENJI] Sorry...
I always make you worry.

1793
01:24:03,041 --> 01:24:04,958
[NATSUKI]
Huh?

1794
01:24:05,041 --> 01:24:06,625
Who are you?

1795
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:08,291
Is Ken gonna--

1796
01:24:08,375 --> 01:24:09,416
That's me, there.

1797
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,750
And I guess I died back then.

1798
01:24:12,666 --> 01:24:14,250
Huh?

1799
01:24:14,333 --> 01:24:16,958
[KENJI] But, you slipped
back in time and changed it.

1800
01:24:17,041 --> 01:24:19,375
You got hurt in my place.

1801
01:24:19,458 --> 01:24:21,875
And it used up all
of your ability.

1802
01:24:21,958 --> 01:24:23,375
When something's changed,

1803
01:24:23,458 --> 01:24:26,375
then something else has got
to change to balance it out.

1804
01:24:27,958 --> 01:24:29,208
[chuckles]

1805
01:24:30,583 --> 01:24:32,708
[NATSUKI]
Uh...

1806
01:24:32,791 --> 01:24:35,500
Well, all right, take care then.

1807
01:24:35,583 --> 01:24:38,166
[NATSUKI]
But... where are you going?

1808
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:40,416
[NATSUKI]
Wait! Wait, Kenji!

1809
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:45,458
[panting]

1810
01:24:45,958 --> 01:24:49,333
Don't leave!
Kenji, you promised!

1811
01:24:49,416 --> 01:24:50,958
We were always--

1812
01:24:51,041 --> 01:24:55,000
We were... always going
to be neighbors! Always!

1813
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:56,250
[sobs]

1814
01:24:56,333 --> 01:24:57,708
[NATSUKI]
You liar.

1815
01:25:00,416 --> 01:25:02,500
[NATSUKI]
Please don't go!

1816
01:25:03,583 --> 01:25:05,000
[NATSUKI]
Kenji...

1817
01:25:05,083 --> 01:25:07,666
[NATSUKI]
You promised me!

1818
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:08,666
[NATSUKI]
Kenji...

1819
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:10,541
[NATSUKI]
You told me yourself!

1820
01:25:10,625 --> 01:25:13,541
You said... You said
we'll always be neighbors.

1821
01:25:13,625 --> 01:25:15,000
[NATSUKI]
Moron.

1822
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:18,833
[NATSUKI]
Don't leave me!

1823
01:25:18,916 --> 01:25:20,958
[NATSUKI]
Kenji, you're a...

1824
01:25:21,041 --> 01:25:23,041
[NATSUKI]
Don't go!

1825
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:24,875
[NATSUKI]
...moron.

1826
01:25:27,208 --> 01:25:28,958
[NATSUKI]
Moron.

1827
01:25:32,541 --> 01:25:36,291
[groans]

1828
01:25:41,041 --> 01:25:42,416
[KAHORI]
It let up.

1829
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:48,833
[NATSUKI]
Was I... talking in my sleep?

1830
01:25:54,833 --> 01:25:57,791
[NATSUKI]
So, I guess you know.

1831
01:25:57,875 --> 01:26:01,250
[KAHORI] I've already known for
a pretty long time, actually.

1832
01:26:03,583 --> 01:26:04,833
[NATSUKI]
Since when?

1833
01:26:04,916 --> 01:26:06,791
[KAHORI] You always
had perfect attendance

1834
01:26:06,875 --> 01:26:10,250
just so you could be
close to Seki, didn't you?

1835
01:26:10,333 --> 01:26:13,083
I always thought that
was kind of sweet.

1836
01:26:13,166 --> 01:26:17,583
[NATSUKI sobs]

1837
01:26:17,666 --> 01:26:20,625
But Kenji likes you,
Kaho, not me!

1838
01:26:22,291 --> 01:26:23,333
[KAHORI]
Mm...

1839
01:26:23,416 --> 01:26:25,875
[NATSUKI]
It's not fair!

1840
01:26:25,958 --> 01:26:28,125
I liked him before
he liked you...

1841
01:26:29,958 --> 01:26:31,416
[NATSUKI]
...always.

1842
01:26:33,666 --> 01:26:39,208
[NATSUKI]
I always liked him... always.

1843
01:26:39,291 --> 01:26:41,750
It's not fair...

1844
01:26:41,833 --> 01:26:46,708
[NATSUKI sobs]

1845
01:26:49,333 --> 01:26:53,125
[KENJI] Okay, so your dad
used to know my grandpa?

1846
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:56,416
[RYOICHI chuckles]
They weren't exactly friends.

1847
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:58,833
Back when my father
traveled to this era,

1848
01:26:58,916 --> 01:27:01,625
your grandfather had
stood against him.

1849
01:27:01,708 --> 01:27:03,208
[KENJI] Why didn't he
just come with you?

1850
01:27:03,291 --> 01:27:05,458
It's only possible to
make one round-trip.

1851
01:27:05,541 --> 01:27:08,375
Any more wears out your heart.

1852
01:27:08,458 --> 01:27:09,791
[KENJI]
Hm...

1853
01:27:09,875 --> 01:27:13,250
So then how come I can feel
his presence sometimes?

1854
01:27:13,333 --> 01:27:15,083
Oh, really?

1855
01:27:15,166 --> 01:27:17,416
I can't think of why you'd--

1856
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:18,416
[KENJI yells]

1857
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,333
[BOTH laugh]

1858
01:27:20,416 --> 01:27:21,666
[RYOICHI]
Hey! I'll get you back!

1859
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:26,541
[laughing continues]

1860
01:27:26,625 --> 01:27:29,291
[RYOICHI] You know,
I think I do like plays now.

1861
01:27:29,375 --> 01:27:30,666
[KENJI]
Yeah?

1862
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:33,208
It's really nice to be
able to talk like this.

1863
01:27:33,291 --> 01:27:34,291
[KENJI chuckles]

1864
01:27:34,375 --> 01:27:36,250
Talking is like a performance?

1865
01:27:36,333 --> 01:27:40,041
It is... if I'm not able
to read your mind.

1866
01:27:40,125 --> 01:27:43,166
Your ability is so much
stronger than mine, by far.

1867
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:44,333
[KENJI grunts]

1868
01:27:44,416 --> 01:27:46,125
[RYOICHI]
It's like the sun and the moon.

1869
01:27:46,208 --> 01:27:48,541
One light is stronger
than the other.

1870
01:27:48,625 --> 01:27:50,875
Even though the moon is
still up there in the sky

1871
01:27:50,958 --> 01:27:52,041
all throughout the day,

1872
01:27:52,125 --> 01:27:54,875
its light will never
shine past the sun.

1873
01:27:54,958 --> 01:27:56,750
[KENJI]
Hm.

1874
01:27:56,833 --> 01:27:59,458
Hey! What's taking you?!

1875
01:27:59,541 --> 01:28:01,375
[NATSUKI giggles]

1876
01:28:18,583 --> 01:28:19,541
Wait!

1877
01:28:19,625 --> 01:28:20,875
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1878
01:28:20,958 --> 01:28:23,250
Guys! This is really scary!

1879
01:28:23,333 --> 01:28:25,166
I'm freaking out right now!

1880
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:27,916
[NATSUKI giggling]

1881
01:28:29,333 --> 01:28:31,791
[KENJI]
Ow...!

1882
01:28:31,875 --> 01:28:33,041
[NATSUKI]
Here we go!

1883
01:28:33,125 --> 01:28:35,458
Guys, get a little
close together, okay?

1884
01:28:37,541 --> 01:28:40,166
[ALL laugh]

1885
01:28:45,625 --> 01:28:47,750
[RYOICHI]
So this is summertime.

1886
01:28:47,833 --> 01:28:51,500
[KAHORI] Oh, so you don't
have different seasons?

1887
01:28:51,583 --> 01:28:52,750
[RYOICHI]
No.

1888
01:28:56,375 --> 01:28:57,791
[RYOICHI]
In "A Midsummer Night's Dream,"

1889
01:28:57,875 --> 01:29:00,541
they all wake up and leave
behind everything that happened,

1890
01:29:00,625 --> 01:29:03,583
like they only
dreamed it, right?

1891
01:29:03,666 --> 01:29:05,791
[KAHORI]
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

1892
01:29:05,875 --> 01:29:07,708
[RYOICHI]
Magic sounds like hypnosis.

1893
01:29:07,791 --> 01:29:09,958
Although...

1894
01:29:10,041 --> 01:29:11,875
[KAHORI]
Hm?

1895
01:29:11,958 --> 01:29:14,750
What happens if you're
put under a spell

1896
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:17,041
and then you end
up falling in love?

1897
01:29:17,125 --> 01:29:18,083
[KAHORI]
Huh?

1898
01:29:19,791 --> 01:29:23,250
[RYOICHI] If you do fall in
love while you're under a spell,

1899
01:29:23,333 --> 01:29:25,666
then does your
love just disappear

1900
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:28,583
as soon as you wake up?

1901
01:29:28,666 --> 01:29:31,750
Can love...
really just go away...

1902
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:33,166
...when a spell is lifted?

1903
01:29:33,250 --> 01:29:35,250
[KAHORI gasps]
Huh?

1904
01:29:38,791 --> 01:29:42,750
[RYOICHI] Well, I'm going
back to the moon... Home.

1905
01:29:42,833 --> 01:29:44,916
Going back? When?!

1906
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:49,333
[RYOICHI]
Tonight... I think.

1907
01:29:51,291 --> 01:29:56,083
Then you'll probably...
just forget all about me.

1908
01:29:56,166 --> 01:29:57,958
Like in the play, right?

1909
01:29:59,541 --> 01:30:00,625
[gasps]

1910
01:30:00,708 --> 01:30:04,000
[RYOICHI]
Look, this is already filled up.

1911
01:30:04,083 --> 01:30:05,291
It is?

1912
01:30:05,375 --> 01:30:06,333
[RYOICHI]
Mm-hm.

1913
01:30:06,416 --> 01:30:09,708
Filled with all
the time I had...

1914
01:30:09,791 --> 01:30:11,708
...with all the months
I've been here,

1915
01:30:11,791 --> 01:30:12,958
away from home.

1916
01:30:16,541 --> 01:30:17,833
[gasps]

1917
01:30:17,916 --> 01:30:19,458
[RYOICHI]
Goodbye.

1918
01:30:19,541 --> 01:30:22,083
You'll play "Clair
de Lune" so well.

1919
01:30:22,166 --> 01:30:23,875
I wish I could hear it.

1920
01:30:30,083 --> 01:30:31,291
[KENJI]
Puck is a real prankster,

1921
01:30:31,375 --> 01:30:33,583
but kind of a
lovable one, you know?

1922
01:30:33,666 --> 01:30:36,083
[NATSUKI]
Huh? What are you talking about?

1923
01:30:36,166 --> 01:30:38,750
[KENJI] Maybe he's
serious in his own way.

1924
01:30:38,833 --> 01:30:41,041
Yeah, but that doesn't
make pranks okay.

1925
01:30:41,125 --> 01:30:43,958
Well, we don't know
what's really in his head.

1926
01:30:44,041 --> 01:30:46,208
Who knows what
magic people think.

1927
01:30:46,291 --> 01:30:47,750
[KAHORI sighs]

1928
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:52,500
[KAHORI gasps]

1929
01:30:52,583 --> 01:30:53,250
[RYOICHI grunts]

1930
01:30:53,333 --> 01:30:54,875
[KAHORI]
Please don't go!

1931
01:30:56,958 --> 01:30:58,708
[RYOICHI]
I'm sorry, but I have to.

1932
01:30:58,791 --> 01:31:01,166
[KAHORI]
But... I like you so much.

1933
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:02,000
[RYOICHI gasps]

1934
01:31:02,083 --> 01:31:03,666
[KAHORI]
Really, I do!

1935
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:06,083
[RYOICHI hisses, sighs]

1936
01:31:06,166 --> 01:31:09,875
[KAHORI] And I know that
I could never forget you.

1937
01:31:09,958 --> 01:31:11,625
So, if you really
do have to leave--

1938
01:31:11,708 --> 01:31:13,166
Please, just don't...

1939
01:31:13,250 --> 01:31:15,541
[KAHORI] So if you--
If you have to leave, then--

1940
01:31:15,625 --> 01:31:16,208
[RYOICHI]
Please don't!

1941
01:31:16,291 --> 01:31:17,375
[sobbing]

1942
01:31:17,458 --> 01:31:18,416
[gasps]

1943
01:31:20,541 --> 01:31:21,833
[KAHORI]
Then I'll--

1944
01:31:21,916 --> 01:31:23,583
[gasps]

1945
01:31:25,416 --> 01:31:27,458
[KAHORI]
Then I'll go with you.

1946
01:31:33,416 --> 01:31:35,083
[KENJI sighs]
Let's go.

1947
01:31:35,166 --> 01:31:36,958
[NATSUKI]
Go where?

1948
01:31:37,041 --> 01:31:39,416
[KENJI]
Get on! I was just thinking.

1949
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:41,541
Without you around,
htere'd be nothing else

1950
01:31:41,625 --> 01:31:43,458
that could ground me
right here to this time.

1951
01:31:43,541 --> 01:31:44,750
[NATSUKI]
Huh?

1952
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:46,125
What's that?

1953
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:49,458
I won't repeat myself.

1954
01:31:49,541 --> 01:31:51,333
[NATSUKI]
No, wait. What do you mean?!

1955
01:31:51,416 --> 01:31:52,791
[KENJI grunting]
Just come on!

1956
01:31:52,875 --> 01:31:55,041
[NATSUKI]
Explain yourself! Jerk.

1957
01:31:56,375 --> 01:31:58,500
[KAHORI crying]

1958
01:31:58,583 --> 01:31:59,708
[RYOICHI]
Sorry...

1959
01:32:01,375 --> 01:32:02,333
[KAHORI]
Huh?

1960
01:32:04,833 --> 01:32:10,583
[RYOICHI] You know, my mother,
she was from this era.

1961
01:32:10,666 --> 01:32:13,708
When she left it
for another one,

1962
01:32:13,791 --> 01:32:16,916
I think that she was
always so lonely.

1963
01:32:23,666 --> 01:32:26,500
[KAHORI gasps]

1964
01:32:36,208 --> 01:32:37,791
[RYOICHI]
Goodbye...

1965
01:33:12,458 --> 01:33:13,333
Hey!

1966
01:33:13,416 --> 01:33:15,541
[NATSUKI]
Uh?

1967
01:33:15,625 --> 01:33:16,666
[RYOICHI grunts]

1968
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:17,458
[KENJI]
Are you alone?

1969
01:33:17,541 --> 01:33:18,708
[RYOICHI]
Yeah.

1970
01:33:20,291 --> 01:33:21,416
[KENJI]
That's good.

1971
01:33:22,416 --> 01:33:23,125
[RYOICHI gasps]

1972

[NATSUKI gasps, yelps]

1973
01:33:27,083 --> 01:33:28,541
[RYOICHI gasps]

1974
01:33:28,625 --> 01:33:31,500
[KENJI] Well, I figured that
I should come and see you off!

1975
01:33:31,583 --> 01:33:32,791
But once you're home--

1976
01:33:34,875 --> 01:33:38,000
I'll have to break-- Ah!

1977
01:33:38,083 --> 01:33:41,041
I understand, but I really
can't allow you to do that.

1978
01:33:41,125 --> 01:33:43,041
[KENJI grunting]

1979
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:45,416

01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:46,666
[gasps]

1981
01:33:55,791 --> 01:33:57,416
[KENJI screams]

1982
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:59,916
Wait, Kyogoku! We can't do this!

1983
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,208
If I fight you,
you could get erased!

1984
01:34:02,291 --> 01:34:05,375
It's fine; I'd accept
anything for our mission.

1985
01:34:05,458 --> 01:34:07,250
[KENJI gasps]

1986
01:34:19,875 --> 01:34:20,833
Huh?

1987
01:34:28,250 --> 01:34:32,000
[gasps, pants]

1988
01:34:33,083 --> 01:34:34,083
[gasps]

1989
01:34:34,166 --> 01:34:37,333
[KENJI grunts]

1990
01:34:42,875 --> 01:34:44,500
[FAMILIAR]
Ryoichi, erase them both!

1991
01:34:44,583 --> 01:34:46,458
Take their ability!

1992
01:34:46,541 --> 01:34:48,041
Then we can change the future.

1993
01:34:48,125 --> 01:34:49,541
Humankind will survive!

1994
01:34:49,625 --> 01:34:52,041
[RYOICHI]
And what happens then?

1995
01:34:52,125 --> 01:34:53,708
[FAMILIAR]
What?!

1996
01:34:53,791 --> 01:34:57,625
[RYOICHI] Listen...
we'll never change a past

1997
01:34:57,708 --> 01:35:00,166
that doesn't have any future.

1998
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:01,875
Enough of this.

1999
01:35:01,958 --> 01:35:04,500
[FAMILIAR]
You fool! Your logic is absurd!

2000
01:35:04,583 --> 01:35:05,666
But I'm right.

2001
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:08,166
You know it, and you've
always known.

2002
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:09,666
Right, Dad?!

2003
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:11,291
[FAMILIAR]
Huh?

2004
01:35:11,375 --> 01:35:13,208
[RYOICHI]
After all, you were never able

2005
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:16,125
to return Mom to
this era, were you?

2006
01:35:20,458 --> 01:35:23,375
[RYOICHI]
So... that just left me...

2007
01:35:23,458 --> 01:35:24,708
[KENJI gasps]

2008
01:35:24,791 --> 01:35:28,375
[RYOICHI] ...one who
doesn't belong... anywhere.

2009
01:35:31,791 --> 01:35:33,541
[KENJI gasps]

2010
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:36,958
[KENJI shouts]

2011
01:35:37,041 --> 01:35:38,833
[FAMILIAR]
No!

2012
01:35:38,916 --> 01:35:42,416
Why? Why does the Earth...

2013
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:45,041
Why does it reject
our mission again?!

2014
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:48,916
[RYOICHI sighs]

2015
01:36:11,291 --> 01:36:14,583
[RYOICHI]
It looks like... snow.

2016
01:36:14,666 --> 01:36:15,875
Wait...

2017
01:36:15,958 --> 01:36:19,916
I don't think I've
ever seen snow before.

2018
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,541
Oh, right.

2019
01:36:22,625 --> 01:36:26,083
It must be from one of those
stories Mother told me...

2020
01:36:26,166 --> 01:36:28,541
...back when I was
just a little kid.

2021

2022
01:36:32,375 --> 01:36:33,458
[RYOICHI]
Huh?

2023
01:36:33,541 --> 01:36:34,458
Wait, Seki!

You knew this would happen

2025
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,500
if you used up your
power before leaving.

2026
01:36:37,583 --> 01:36:40,666
Seki, get back!
Or you'll be erased also!

2027
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:42,250
[KENJI]
But Kyogoku,

2028
01:36:42,333 --> 01:36:45,166
Even though it's not possible
for you to just read my mind...

2029
01:36:46,916 --> 01:36:49,541
...you're still able
to hold onto my hand.

2030
01:36:49,625 --> 01:36:50,791
[RYOICHI]
Huh...?

2031
01:36:50,875 --> 01:36:52,416
[KENJI]
Isn't that enough?

2032
01:36:53,666 --> 01:36:56,333
[KENJI] I can tell that
your hand is warm.

2033
01:36:56,416 --> 01:36:58,583
And I can tell
that you're close.

2034
01:37:00,083 --> 01:37:01,166
[RYOICHI sighs]

2035
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:04,000
[KENJI]
So, isn't that enough?

2036
01:37:04,083 --> 01:37:07,666
[NATSUKI giggles]

2037
01:37:12,791 --> 01:37:15,291
[BOTH laugh]

2038
01:37:28,833 --> 01:37:31,250
[NATSUKI gasps]
Kenji!

2039
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:33,958
[KENJI, RYOICHI panting]

2040
01:37:34,041 --> 01:37:35,041
[NATSUKI]
What?

2041
01:37:37,416 --> 01:37:39,625
[RYOICHI]
Why are you... doing this...?

2042
01:37:40,875 --> 01:37:44,791
[KENJI] I told you...
that I came to see you off.

2043
01:37:44,875 --> 01:37:47,666
[RYOICHI] I'm not able to
exist in this time anymore.

2044
01:37:49,458 --> 01:37:51,416
[RYOICHI]
And now, I can't go home.

2045
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,291
[KENJI]
Then I'll bring you home.

2046
01:37:53,375 --> 01:37:56,458
[RYOICHI]
I'll be erased, no matter what.

2047
01:37:56,541 --> 01:37:58,625
[KENJI] I can at least
manage a one-way trip.

2048
01:37:58,708 --> 01:38:00,208
[RYOICHI]
That's ridiculous.

2049
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:01,791
You'd only be stranded.

2050
01:38:01,875 --> 01:38:03,791
Look, Kyogoku...

2051
01:38:03,875 --> 01:38:07,083
There's no one who
doesn't belong anywhere.

2052
01:38:08,958 --> 01:38:11,458
[KENJI] The reason that
you're still here right now

2053
01:38:11,541 --> 01:38:14,833
is because there are people
who want you to be here.

2054
01:38:14,916 --> 01:38:17,708
It's the same for
you as it is for me.

2055
01:38:19,666 --> 01:38:22,291
And maybe... for everyone.

2056
01:38:22,375 --> 01:38:23,708
[RYOICHI gasps]

2057
01:38:25,166 --> 01:38:27,250
[KENJI chuckles]

2058
01:38:29,583 --> 01:38:30,541
[RYOICHI sighs]

2059
01:38:31,208 --> 01:38:33,291
Maybe... you're right.

2060
01:38:35,958 --> 01:38:37,666
[KENJI]
Uh... Sorry, Natsuki.

2061
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:38,750
[NATSUKI]
Huh?

2062
01:38:38,833 --> 01:38:41,250
[KENJI]
I'll be right back. Okay?

2063
01:38:41,333 --> 01:38:42,250
From where?

2064
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:44,500
[KENJI]
Wait for me, all right?

2065
01:38:44,583 --> 01:38:47,416
You... You want me
to just wait for you?

2066
01:38:48,875 --> 01:38:50,208
[chuckles]

2067
01:38:50,291 --> 01:38:51,958
[RYOICHI]
I think...

2068
01:38:52,041 --> 01:38:54,791
If I was born in this era...

2069
01:38:54,875 --> 01:38:56,333
...we could've been...

2070
01:38:56,416 --> 01:38:58,000
[KENJI chuckles]
Oh, quit it.

2071
01:38:59,875 --> 01:39:02,000
[KENJI]
Me and you are already friends,

2072
01:39:02,083 --> 01:39:04,041
just the way things
are right now.

2073
01:39:05,583 --> 01:39:08,416
Time and space wouldn't
change things.

2074
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:10,875
Nothing would.

2075
01:39:10,958 --> 01:39:14,041
[NATSUKI yelps, screams]

2078
01:39:29,541 --> 01:39:31,166
No! Kenji, wait!

What...? Why am I...?

2085
01:40:16,541 --> 01:40:18,750
[NATSUKI]
I said Kenji...

2086
01:40:22,125 --> 01:40:23,958
[NATSUKI]
Who is that?

2087
01:44:51,416 --> 01:44:52,750
[STUDENT A]
Have you heard yet?

2088
01:44:52,833 --> 01:44:54,083
[STUDENT B]
About what?

2089
01:44:54,166 --> 01:44:56,375
[STUDENT A] That transfer
student we're getting.

2090
01:44:56,458 --> 01:44:59,041
[STUDENT B]
Transfer student?

2091
01:44:59,125 --> 01:45:05,625
[phone rings]

2092
01:45:05,708 --> 01:45:06,750
[KAHORI]
Huh?

2093
01:45:06,833 --> 01:45:08,083
[NATSUKI]
Uh-mm.

2094
01:45:08,166 --> 01:45:09,875
I don't know this number.

2095

[NATSUKI gasping]

2097
01:45:16,125 --> 01:45:19,750
[KENJI] Come on! Will you please
just answer your cell already?

2098
01:45:19,833 --> 01:45:20,791
[KAHORI gasps]

2099
01:45:25,041 --> 01:45:27,958
Aw, man... That is so weird.

2100
01:45:28,041 --> 01:45:29,666
Giving you this phone
call was supposed to

2101
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:31,750
make you remember me again.

2102
01:45:36,416 --> 01:45:38,916

I'm back now.
