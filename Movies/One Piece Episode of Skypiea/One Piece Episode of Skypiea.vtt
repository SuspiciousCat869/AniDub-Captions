Oh, thank you very much.

Here's yours, Nami.

00:00:15.067 --> 00:00:16.000 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Thanks.

[LUFFY]
Hey, Usopp! Usopp!

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.067 position:5% line:89% align:start
This better be important, Luffy.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.400 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, what?

00:00:32.434 --> 00:00:33.467 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm Chopper!

[laughter]

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:37.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
Ugh, they're so
easily entertained.

00:00:37.267 --> 00:00:39.033 position:27% line:83% align:start
At least they're
cheerful, right?

[NARRATOR]
Monkey D. Luffy,

00:00:41.234 --> 00:00:43.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
the boy who aspires to
become King of the Pirates,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.300 position:19% line:83% align:start
continues his journey
on the Grand Line

00:00:45.334 --> 00:00:47.200 position:16% line:89% align:start
with his faithful crew:

00:00:47.234 --> 00:00:50.067 position:33% line:83% align:start
Zoro, Nami,
Usopp, Sanji, Chopper,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
and their newest member,
Nico Robin,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
who recently joined them
during their visit

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
to a desert kingdom
called Alabasta.

00:00:58.534 --> 00:01:00.133 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ROBIN]
By the way, Miss Navigator.

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:02.234 position:5% line:89% align:start
Have you been checking the logs?

00:01:02.267 --> 00:01:04.234 position:10% line:89% align:start
Straight to west-northwest!

00:01:04.267 --> 00:01:05.133 position:33% line:89% align:start
Don't worry!

00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:06.667 position:13% line:89% align:start
Everything is good to go!

00:01:06.701 --> 00:01:07.667 position:38% line:89% align:start
Lovely.

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:11.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
If I remember correctly,
Autumn Island is nearby.

00:01:13.634 --> 00:01:15.033 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
Hmm?

00:01:15.067 --> 00:01:16.701 position:35% line:89% align:start
That rain?

00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:23.701 position:13% line:89% align:start
I don't think that's rain.

00:01:35.067 --> 00:01:36.734 position:27% line:89% align:start
Is that a boat?

00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:37.634 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's a galleon!

00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:39.400 position:33% line:89% align:start
[shrieking]

00:01:39.434 --> 00:01:40.467 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the hell?

00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:42.100 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:12.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
What's going on?
This shouldn't be possible!

00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:20.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SANJI] Watch out,
there's still more debris!

00:02:26.234 --> 00:02:28.434 position:30% line:83% align:start
Whoa, what the
heck is happening?

00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:29.467 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's kinda awesome!

00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:31.200 position:16% line:89% align:start
Luffy, protect the ship!

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:32.234 position:33% line:89% align:start
It'll wreck!

00:02:32.267 --> 00:02:33.067 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay!

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.000 position:38% line:89% align:start
I can--

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.634 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's this paper?

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:39.734 position:35% line:83% align:start
Hey, Nami,
you should check this out!

00:02:39.767 --> 00:02:41.567 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Does it look like I have time?

00:02:41.601 --> 00:02:45.234 position:30% line:89% align:start
[CREW screams]

00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:07.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
Is it normal for boats to
fall outta the sky like that?

00:03:07.501 --> 00:03:09.100 position:30% line:89% align:start
No, it isn't.

00:03:09.133 --> 00:03:11.400 position:13% line:89% align:start
I don't see anything else.

00:03:11.434 --> 00:03:12.501 position:30% line:89% align:start
[NAMI screams]

00:03:12.534 --> 00:03:13.300 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
Huh?

00:03:13.334 --> 00:03:14.734 position:16% line:89% align:start
What's the matter, Nami?

00:03:14.767 --> 00:03:17.100 position:13% line:89% align:start
Just look at the Log Pose.

00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:18.534 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's broken!

00:03:18.567 --> 00:03:20.601 position:19% line:89% align:start
It only points upward!

00:03:20.634 --> 00:03:22.167 position:33% line:89% align:start
This is bad.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
We can't find the
next island without it!

00:03:25.133 --> 00:03:26.367 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's not stuck.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.300 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:03:28.334 --> 00:03:30.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's simply detecting
a different island now.

00:03:30.734 --> 00:03:33.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
One with an even
stronger magnetic pull.

00:03:33.267 --> 00:03:34.167 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
[ROBIN] If it's pointing
straight upwards.

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:41.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
That must mean that it's
been caught by a Sky Island.

00:03:41.734 --> 00:03:42.767 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:03:42.801 --> 00:03:44.234 position:30% line:89% align:start
A Sky Island?

00:03:44.267 --> 00:03:44.667 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Hmm?

00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:46.634 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah. Look.

00:03:48.067 --> 00:03:49.567 position:24% line:89% align:start
What does it say?

00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:51.300 position:38% line:89% align:start
Skypiea.

00:03:51.334 --> 00:03:53.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
A map of a Sky Island?

00:03:53.267 --> 00:03:56.534 position:30% line:89% align:start
What? No way.

00:03:56.567 --> 00:03:59.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
There can't really be an
island in the sky, can there?

00:03:59.133 --> 00:04:00.334 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yuh-huh!

00:04:00.367 --> 00:04:01.467 position:30% line:89% align:start
Come on, Nami!

00:04:01.501 --> 00:04:02.667 position:24% line:89% align:start
We gotta go there!

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:04.267 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's a real Sky Island!

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.267 position:5% line:89% align:start
Whoo, This is gonna be a blast!

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.567 position:5% line:89% align:start
Skypiea! Skypiea! Hey, Skypi--!

00:04:09.601 --> 00:04:12.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
Then how do we reach it?

00:04:12.133 --> 00:04:14.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's supposed to be up
in the sky, remember?

00:04:14.667 --> 00:04:16.234 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's not like we can fly.

00:04:16.267 --> 00:04:18.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
And this doesn't
say how to get there!

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.400 position:7% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] You're the navigator,
figure it out!

00:04:20.434 --> 00:04:23.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
[NAMI] Some things
can't just be "figured out"!

00:05:14.767 --> 00:05:18.601 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CREW]
Giant monsters!

00:05:38.801 --> 00:05:40.300 position:16% line:89% align:start
Jaya's not a bad island

00:05:40.334 --> 00:05:42.267 position:30% line:83% align:start
for us to stay
on for the moment,

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.400 position:27% line:83% align:start
but the Log Pose
still won't budge,

00:05:44.434 --> 00:05:47.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
which means we might
have to go to the Sky Island.

00:05:47.167 --> 00:05:48.801 position:30% line:83% align:start
[USOPP, LUFFY]
I think we're okay right here.

00:05:48.834 --> 00:05:49.701 position:30% line:89% align:start
This is fine!

00:05:49.734 --> 00:05:51.133 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, Nami!

00:05:51.167 --> 00:05:52.467 position:21% line:89% align:start
Just for you girls.

00:05:52.501 --> 00:05:54.400 position:7% line:89% align:start
Here's a new takoyaki recipe!

00:05:54.434 --> 00:05:55.067 position:38% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.501 position:10% line:89% align:start
I already knew you goofballs

00:05:56.534 --> 00:06:00.501 position:30% line:83% align:start
wouldn't be in
any hurry to set sail.

00:06:00.534 --> 00:06:01.634 position:30% line:89% align:start
Look at this.

00:06:01.667 --> 00:06:03.467 position:16% line:89% align:start
It might come in handy.

00:06:04.434 --> 00:06:07.767 position:7% line:83% align:start
[ROBIN] The left area is Mock
Town, which is where we are now.

00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:08.701 position:24% line:89% align:start
But if you notice,

00:06:08.734 --> 00:06:12.033 position:27% line:83% align:start
there's an X on
the other side of the map.

00:06:12.067 --> 00:06:15.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
A man lives there
who's quite different.

00:06:15.267 --> 00:06:16.767 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
What does that mean?

00:06:22.534 --> 00:06:24.434 position:30% line:83% align:start
--[USOPP] So!
--[LUFFY] So big!

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:26.701 position:30% line:83% align:start
Look it over
one more time, you two.

00:06:26.734 --> 00:06:29.133 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Huh? It's just a board!

00:06:29.167 --> 00:06:31.100 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's with that?!

00:06:31.801 --> 00:06:35.334 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hello? Mind if I come in?

00:06:35.367 --> 00:06:38.167 position:16% line:89% align:start
Huh. Nobody's home, huh?

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.734 position:19% line:89% align:start
Guess it's okay then!

00:06:39.767 --> 00:06:41.567 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Oh wow.

00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:45.501 position:10% line:83% align:start
This is an old picture book
called "Noland the Liar."

00:06:45.534 --> 00:06:46.367 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah? That sounds
like a good title.

00:06:52.133 --> 00:06:53.300 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Let's see.

00:06:53.334 --> 00:06:55.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
"Our story began
a very long time ago,

00:06:55.801 --> 00:06:58.734 position:10% line:89% align:start
about 400 years in the past.

00:06:58.767 --> 00:07:01.534 position:19% line:83% align:start
"There once was a man
named Mont Blanc Noland

00:07:01.567 --> 00:07:04.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
who lived in a country
in the North Blue.

00:07:04.734 --> 00:07:06.434 position:19% line:89% align:start
Noland was an explorer

00:07:06.467 --> 00:07:07.334 position:19% line:89% align:start
who was always talking

00:07:07.367 --> 00:07:10.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
about the incredible
adventures he had.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
However, the villagers
could never be sure

00:07:12.467 --> 00:07:15.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
if the stories he told
were true or false.

00:07:15.434 --> 00:07:17.400 position:5% line:89% align:start
One day, he reported to the king

00:07:17.434 --> 00:07:20.601 position:27% line:83% align:start
after returning
from one of his journeys.

00:07:20.634 --> 00:07:23.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
'While I was out at sea,
I discovered an island

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
with a city of gold on it!'
he exclaimed.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.434 position:21% line:89% align:start
The King was amazed,

00:07:27.467 --> 00:07:29.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
so he took Noland
with him on a voyage

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
to find out whether
the story was true.

00:07:31.801 --> 00:07:33.667 position:5% line:89% align:start
After surviving a perilous trip,

00:07:33.701 --> 00:07:35.133 position:5% line:89% align:start
the two of them finally arrived

00:07:35.167 --> 00:07:37.567 position:21% line:83% align:start
on the island that
Noland had described.

00:07:37.601 --> 00:07:38.834 position:5% line:89% align:start
But much to the King's surprise,

00:07:38.868 --> 00:07:43.400 position:7% line:83% align:start
there was no gold to be found
there, only an ordinary jungle.

00:07:43.434 --> 00:07:44.667 position:33% line:89% align:start
"In the end.

00:07:44.701 --> 00:07:48.133 position:7% line:83% align:start
Noland was sentenced to death
for telling such a tall tale.

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:51.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
And his final words
were as follows:

to the bottom of the sea!'

00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:57.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
The King and his subjects
were dumbfounded.

00:07:57.367 --> 00:07:58.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
In that moment,

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
they realized that
no matter what he said,

00:08:00.334 --> 00:08:02.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
they wouldn't be able
to believe him any longer.

00:08:02.701 --> 00:08:03.634 position:27% line:89% align:start
How could they,

00:08:03.667 --> 00:08:06.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
when he'd continued
to lie until his death?"

00:08:06.501 --> 00:08:08.100 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's the end.

00:08:08.133 --> 00:08:10.167 position:30% line:83% align:start
The point is,
if you lie, you die.

And what are you
looking at me for?

[SANJI] "Noland the Liar,"
that takes me back.

00:08:15.334 --> 00:08:17.167 position:10% line:89% align:start
I read that story as a kid.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.200 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait, you know this book, Sanji?

00:08:19.234 --> 00:08:20.267 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm surprised.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.234 position:7% line:83% align:start
It says that it was published
in the North Blue.

00:08:22.267 --> 00:08:23.300 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:08:23.334 --> 00:08:25.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
Believe it or not,
I was born in the North Blue.

00:08:25.801 --> 00:08:28.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's a pretty famous story
where I come from.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.767 position:41% line:89% align:start
Duuuu!

What kinda bird is that?

00:08:31.567 --> 00:08:32.467 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's weird, huh?

00:09:00.434 --> 00:09:02.634 position:13% line:89% align:start

Hold on!

00:09:05.701 --> 00:09:06.667 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Usopp.

00:09:06.701 --> 00:09:08.334 position:24% line:89% align:start
Get Luffy for me.

00:09:08.367 --> 00:09:09.534 position:35% line:89% align:start
Uh, sure!

00:09:21.234 --> 00:09:22.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
That was close!

Don't worry, guys.

00:09:25.634 --> 00:09:27.767 position:24% line:89% align:start

[CHOPPER]
Yeah.

00:09:44.667 --> 00:09:48.334 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's a painful sickness that
divers can get sometimes.

00:09:48.367 --> 00:09:50.534 position:13% line:89% align:start
Sorry to trouble you all.

00:09:50.567 --> 00:09:52.601 position:21% line:83% align:start

another bunch of morons

00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:54.267 position:27% line:83% align:start
who were tryin'
to steal the gold.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.367 position:24% line:89% align:start
What did you say?

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
Wait, don't get up yet!

00:09:57.267 --> 00:09:58.701 position:19% line:89% align:start
Thanks a lot, Doctor.

00:09:58.734 --> 00:10:00.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
You've got some skill.

00:10:00.267 --> 00:10:01.634 position:10% line:89% align:start
Compliment me all you want,

00:10:01.667 --> 00:10:04.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
but it's not gonna get you
anywhere, you big dummy!

00:10:04.334 --> 00:10:06.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
So what was it you
wanted to ask me about?

00:10:06.734 --> 00:10:07.634 position:35% line:89% align:start
Just this:

00:10:07.667 --> 00:10:09.801 position:30% line:83% align:start
Are those two
big monkeys pets of yours?

00:10:09.834 --> 00:10:11.534 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's your question?

00:10:11.567 --> 00:10:14.200 position:35% line:83% align:start
Oh, yeah,
that's Masira and Shojo,

00:10:14.234 --> 00:10:16.367 position:13% line:89% align:start
and they're my underlings.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'd been out diving
every day in the hopes

00:10:19.067 --> 00:10:21.234 position:13% line:89% align:start
of discovering some gold.

00:10:21.267 --> 00:10:22.234 position:35% line:89% align:start
I hear ya!

00:10:22.267 --> 00:10:25.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
Anyway, one day these
two big guys came along.

00:10:25.634 --> 00:10:28.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
They told me they wanted
to help me search.

00:10:28.133 --> 00:10:30.434 position:10% line:83% align:start
Okay, I think that's enough
of your monkey story.

00:10:30.467 --> 00:10:31.467 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's rude!

00:10:31.501 --> 00:10:33.534 position:5% line:89% align:start
So anyway, about the Sky Island,

00:10:33.567 --> 00:10:35.300 position:27% line:83% align:start
can you tell us
how we can get there?

00:10:35.334 --> 00:10:37.601 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:10:37.634 --> 00:10:40.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
You mean you actually
think that place exists?

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:40.934 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?

00:10:40.968 --> 00:10:42.701 position:10% line:89% align:start
So the Sky Island's a fake?

00:10:42.734 --> 00:10:43.701 position:30% line:89% align:start
No one knows.

00:10:43.734 --> 00:10:47.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
I only know of someone
who said it was real.

00:10:47.601 --> 00:10:50.467 position:19% line:83% align:start
But he was famous for
lying about everything.

00:10:50.501 --> 00:10:52.734 position:19% line:89% align:start
Old Mont Blanc Noland.

00:10:52.767 --> 00:10:55.601 position:27% line:83% align:start
Ever read about
"Noland the Liar"?

00:10:55.634 --> 00:10:56.300 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:56.334 --> 00:10:58.667 position:7% line:89% align:start
My name's Mont Blanc Cricket!

00:10:58.701 --> 00:11:02.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
Which means Noland is
my grandad's grandad's...

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.400 position:19% line:89% align:start
Wait, let me think...

00:11:03.434 --> 00:11:06.501 position:19% line:89% align:start
Uh, he's my ancestor.

00:11:06.534 --> 00:11:09.334 position:10% line:89% align:start
Our whole family was exiled.

00:11:09.367 --> 00:11:11.434 position:7% line:89% align:start
We're still hated to this day,

00:11:11.467 --> 00:11:14.767 position:5% line:89% align:start
so we try to keep a low profile.

00:11:14.801 --> 00:11:15.934 position:38% line:89% align:start
Even so,

00:11:15.968 --> 00:11:19.133 position:13% line:83% align:start
no one in the family holds
any ill will against Noland.

00:11:19.167 --> 00:11:20.267 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Why?

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.334 position:27% line:83% align:start
Because despite
what the story says,

00:11:22.367 --> 00:11:26.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
we know that he was honest.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
You remember what
his last words were

00:11:27.801 --> 00:11:29.801 position:16% line:89% align:start
in the book, don't you?

00:11:29.834 --> 00:11:30.868 position:30% line:89% align:start
"That's right!

00:11:35.267 --> 00:11:36.334 position:33% line:89% align:start
In the book,

00:11:36.367 --> 00:11:39.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
they draw him with a
stupid expression on his face,

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.801 position:27% line:83% align:start
but he actually
shed a lot of tears

00:11:40.834 --> 00:11:43.501 position:7% line:89% align:start
and suffered a horrible death.

00:11:43.534 --> 00:11:46.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
Noland insisted that
the ruins he discovered

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
had submerged because
of crustal movements.

00:11:49.534 --> 00:11:50.567 position:21% line:89% align:start
But everyone thought

00:11:50.601 --> 00:11:54.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
he was only making excuses
to save his own skin.

00:11:54.334 --> 00:11:58.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
So with the villagers
looking on and laughing.

00:11:58.067 --> 00:12:00.734 position:16% line:89% align:start
Noland was put to death.

the Mont Blanc family name!

No.

that's fine too.

my entire life was changed.

That's right.

the island in there.

he saw some Sky Fish.

00:13:38.701 --> 00:13:40.701 position:7% line:89% align:start
even in the middle of the day.

00:13:40.734 --> 00:13:44.200 position:13% line:83% align:start
Certain large clouds known
as "imperiocumulus clouds"

00:13:44.234 --> 00:13:46.601 position:5% line:89% align:start
begin to appear high in the sky.

00:13:46.634 --> 00:13:48.601 position:27% line:83% align:start
They block out
every ounce of sunlight

00:13:48.634 --> 00:13:53.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
and cover everything in
impermeable darkness.

00:13:53.067 --> 00:13:56.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
Listen, if a Sky Island
really does exist somewhere,

00:13:56.801 --> 00:13:59.534 position:27% line:83% align:start
then that's the
only possible place!

00:13:59.567 --> 00:14:00.400 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Hmm?

00:14:00.434 --> 00:14:01.267 position:24% line:89% align:start
What do you mean?

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
In order to rise
above these clouds,

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
you'll need to ride
a Monstrous Current!

00:14:14.234 --> 00:14:17.501 position:7% line:83% align:start
[CRICKET] A Monstrous Current
is just what it sounds like.

00:14:17.534 --> 00:14:20.701 position:10% line:83% align:start
A strong current that shoots
straight into the air.

00:14:20.734 --> 00:14:23.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
The theory goes
something like this.

00:14:23.133 --> 00:14:25.234 position:10% line:89% align:start
Deep beneath the sea floor,

00:14:25.267 --> 00:14:26.801 position:5% line:89% align:start
there are several large cavities

00:14:26.834 --> 00:14:30.634 position:13% line:83% align:start
that low-temperature water
steadily seeps into over time.

00:14:30.667 --> 00:14:34.467 position:7% line:83% align:start
The heat from the ground below
turns that water into steam,

00:14:34.501 --> 00:14:38.334 position:10% line:83% align:start
and the resulting pressure
activates a colossal explosion!

00:14:38.367 --> 00:14:45.167 position:38% line:89% align:start
[roars]

00:14:46.601 --> 00:14:50.267 position:7% line:83% align:start
[CRICKET] This tends to occur
five times every month.

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:51.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
But if the Sky Island
doesn't appear

00:14:51.801 --> 00:14:54.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
above the current
when you shoot up,

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.167 position:27% line:83% align:start
then you'll slam
back down to the surface

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
and end up dead at
the bottom of the sea.

00:15:01.334 --> 00:15:03.167 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CRICKET]
We reinforced your ship.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
Masira and Shojo
did excellent work.

00:15:06.067 --> 00:15:09.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
Power, speed, weight,
the whole package.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
All of the adjustments
have been made for you.

00:15:15.133 --> 00:15:17.067 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CRICKET]
Are you ready?

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.467 position:13% line:89% align:start
Sky Island, here we come!

00:15:41.534 --> 00:15:42.534 position:38% line:89% align:start
Woohoo!

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:44.067 position:27% line:89% align:start
This is so fun!

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.434 position:7% line:89% align:start
I thought we were dead there!

00:15:46.467 --> 00:15:47.534 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
No way,

00:15:47.567 --> 00:15:48.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
the ship's traveling
straight up a pillar of water!

00:15:48.801 --> 00:15:51.133 position:13% line:89% align:start
How is this even possible?

00:15:51.167 --> 00:15:53.033 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
It's working!

00:16:16.334 --> 00:16:17.234 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, Merry!

00:16:17.267 --> 00:16:18.534 position:33% line:89% align:start
You did it!

00:16:18.567 --> 00:16:22.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
We're headed straight
for the Sky Island!

00:16:30.701 --> 00:16:32.100 position:38% line:89% align:start
It fell.

00:16:32.133 --> 00:16:34.200 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yup, guess so.

00:16:34.234 --> 00:16:35.400 position:27% line:89% align:start
Looks that way.

00:16:35.434 --> 00:16:36.801 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's gonna hit
the sea floor and die,

00:16:36.834 --> 00:16:38.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
and the same thing'll
happen to us if we fall.

00:16:38.734 --> 00:16:40.067 position:33% line:83% align:start
Why am I the
only one freaking out?

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.167 position:24% line:89% align:start
Spread the sails!

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.300 position:35% line:89% align:start
And hurry!

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:43.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
[USOPP, SANJI, CHOPPER]
What?

00:16:43.767 --> 00:16:45.634 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
This may be a pillar of water,

00:16:45.667 --> 00:16:47.501 position:30% line:83% align:start
but it's still
technically the sea,

00:16:47.534 --> 00:16:50.601 position:27% line:83% align:start
and we're still
riding on a current!

00:16:50.634 --> 00:16:52.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
The wind blowing up
from below us

00:16:52.234 --> 00:16:53.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
is a rising current
of air produced

00:16:53.834 --> 00:16:58.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
by the geothermal heat
and steam explosion!

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:02.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
If it's wind and sea,
then I can work with it!

00:17:02.534 --> 00:17:05.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
Who's the navigator
on this vessel?

00:17:05.067 --> 00:17:06.734 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
You are, Nami!

00:17:14.567 --> 00:17:16.200 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
We're gonna fall to our deaths!

00:17:16.234 --> 00:17:17.434 position:21% line:89% align:start
Nami, do something!

00:17:17.467 --> 00:17:19.701 position:24% line:89% align:start
No. We'll make it!

00:17:33.667 --> 00:17:38.734 position:7% line:89% align:start
Awesome! The Merry is flying!

00:17:38.767 --> 00:17:39.467 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
What the--?

00:17:39.501 --> 00:17:42.400 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
You're the best, Nami!

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.167 position:27% line:89% align:start
We're doing it!

00:17:57.767 --> 00:17:58.734 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, kid.

00:17:58.767 --> 00:18:00.300 position:35% line:89% align:start
Listen up.

00:18:00.334 --> 00:18:02.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's just one thing
that you need to know.

00:18:02.701 --> 00:18:03.667 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:18:03.701 --> 00:18:05.501 position:16% line:83% align:start
[CRICKET] People may not
have believed Noland,

00:18:05.534 --> 00:18:07.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
but no one has ever
disproved the existence

00:18:07.534 --> 00:18:11.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
of the City of Gold
or the Sky Island.

00:18:11.133 --> 00:18:14.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
So let them laugh and
say that my logic is foolish.

00:18:14.634 --> 00:18:16.567 position:19% line:89% align:start
I couldn't care less.

00:18:16.601 --> 00:18:19.267 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's what legends are, right?

00:18:53.767 --> 00:18:54.567 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:18:54.601 --> 00:18:56.501 position:19% line:89% align:start
What's that up there?

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.734 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Looks like a wall of clouds!

00:19:06.167 --> 00:19:07.567 position:19% line:89% align:start
Too late to slow down.

00:19:07.601 --> 00:19:09.634 position:7% line:89% align:start
We're plunging right into it!

00:19:20.267 --> 00:19:22.200 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
What is this?

00:19:22.234 --> 00:19:24.200 position:21% line:89% align:start
An ocean in the sky?

00:20:29.234 --> 00:20:30.601 position:30% line:89% align:start
[LUFFY gasps]

00:20:34.334 --> 00:20:36.801 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Huh? We're on the clouds?

00:20:36.834 --> 00:20:37.968 position:27% line:89% align:start
How can that be?

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.601 position:13% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] That's dumb, Nami,
a boat can't sit on a cloud!

00:20:40.634 --> 00:20:42.501 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
That's the point!

00:20:42.534 --> 00:20:44.133 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Oh. Right.

00:20:58.701 --> 00:21:04.534 position:13% line:83% align:start
Finally. After I've spent
six years in this temple...

00:21:04.567 --> 00:21:05.434 position:35% line:89% align:start
[gasping]

00:21:05.467 --> 00:21:08.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
...the Maxim has
reached its completion.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.133 position:27% line:83% align:start
Or, that's what
I wish I could say.

00:21:11.167 --> 00:21:13.033 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's almost done, at least.

00:21:13.067 --> 00:21:14.667 position:21% line:89% align:start
More importantly...

00:21:17.601 --> 00:21:18.567 position:5% line:89% align:start
He can't understand what you say

00:21:18.601 --> 00:21:21.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
if you keep biting
your bottom lip like that.

00:21:21.133 --> 00:21:22.234 position:35% line:83% align:start
[GEDATSU]
So careless!

00:21:22.267 --> 00:21:24.667 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:26.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
The world of dreams
is waiting for us,

00:21:26.734 --> 00:21:29.501 position:30% line:83% align:start
so let's lay
waste to this island.

00:21:29.534 --> 00:21:31.634 position:16% line:89% align:start
I hope you're all ready.

[ENERU]
Hmm?

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.133 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's the matter?

00:21:37.167 --> 00:21:38.667 position:33% line:89% align:start
Interesting.

00:21:38.701 --> 00:21:40.300 position:10% line:89% align:start
It appears a group of seven

00:21:40.334 --> 00:21:43.067 position:27% line:83% align:start
is preparing to
invade my country.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:46.133 position:24% line:83% align:start
Only the almighty
God Eneru could know that!

00:21:46.167 --> 00:21:48.734 position:19% line:83% align:start
He's on another level,
that's for sure!

[ENERU laughs]

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.634 position:7% line:89% align:start
Let's make quick work of them.

00:21:52.667 --> 00:21:56.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
We'll give unto them
Heaven's Judgment!

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.767 position:7% line:89% align:start
They will bow down before God.

00:22:10.267 --> 00:22:10.767 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, no!

00:22:10.801 --> 00:22:12.467 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's that?

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.167 position:5% line:89% align:start
Kinda looks like a big lobster!

I dunno; ask him!

00:22:31.367 --> 00:22:33.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] What is this,
some kinda cloud river?

00:22:33.434 --> 00:22:35.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
[ROBIN] I don't think
it's naturally occurring.

"Godland."

[LUFFY]
Hmm?

00:24:09.734 --> 00:24:12.567 position:5% line:89% align:start
I assume you're Blue Sea people?

00:24:12.601 --> 00:24:13.734 position:33% line:89% align:start
Who are you?

00:24:13.767 --> 00:24:15.634 position:19% line:89% align:start
And what's that mean?

00:24:15.667 --> 00:24:18.167 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm the one they
call the Sky Knight,

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
and "Blue Sea people"
is our term for those

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:21.801 position:10% line:89% align:start
who live beneath the clouds.

00:24:21.834 --> 00:24:22.734 position:33% line:89% align:start
Now tell me,

00:24:22.767 --> 00:24:25.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
did you all come up here
from the Blue Sea?

00:24:25.501 --> 00:24:27.033 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Mm-hm. We sure did.

00:24:27.067 --> 00:24:28.801 position:30% line:83% align:start
Hey, what are
you drinkin' there?

00:24:28.834 --> 00:24:29.767 position:41% line:89% align:start
This?

00:24:29.801 --> 00:24:31.534 position:16% line:89% align:start
Just some pumpkin juice.

00:24:31.567 --> 00:24:33.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's my favorite
beverage, actually.

00:24:33.667 --> 00:24:35.067 position:21% line:89% align:start
Sounds pretty good!

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.234 position:41% line:89% align:start
Luffy!

00:24:36.267 --> 00:24:40.601 position:13% line:83% align:start
We have way more important
questions for him than that!

00:24:40.634 --> 00:24:41.400 position:35% line:83% align:start
[GAN FALL]
Hmm?

00:24:41.434 --> 00:24:44.300 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:24:50.334 --> 00:24:52.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
Is that one of those
Sky Fish things?

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:53.601 position:27% line:89% align:start
Bet it's tasty!

00:24:53.634 --> 00:24:55.534 position:21% line:89% align:start
It just never ends.

00:24:57.167 --> 00:24:58.734 position:33% line:89% align:start
Now, Pierre!

00:25:00.634 --> 00:25:04.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
[GAN FALL] I am the
Sky Knight known as Gan Fall!

00:25:04.067 --> 00:25:06.734 position:16% line:89% align:start
And I will vanquish you!

00:25:17.767 --> 00:25:18.767 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yahoo!

00:25:18.801 --> 00:25:20.667 position:16% line:89% align:start
This guy's pretty tough!

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.434 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, no!

00:25:28.501 --> 00:25:30.434 position:24% line:89% align:start
Now, Mouton Shoot!

00:25:31.267 --> 00:25:33.033 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
Tatsu Maki!

00:25:33.634 --> 00:25:37.200 position:19% line:89% align:start
Now, Gum-Gum Gatling!

00:25:48.334 --> 00:25:51.567 position:33% line:77% align:start
[CONIS] I'm Conis, and
this is Suu, she's a
Cloud Fox.

00:25:51.601 --> 00:25:53.534 position:52% line:83% align:start
I'm so glad you
rescued us.

00:25:53.567 --> 00:25:55.501 position:52% line:83% align:start
If not for you,
we'd be done for.

00:25:55.534 --> 00:25:56.501 position:58% line:89% align:start
Thanks, heso!

00:25:56.534 --> 00:25:57.300 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:25:57.334 --> 00:25:58.501 position:33% line:89% align:start
Uh, "heso"?

00:25:58.534 --> 00:26:00.801 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hey. What's this vehicle?

00:26:00.834 --> 00:26:02.701 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, that's a Waver.

00:26:02.734 --> 00:26:03.734 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Hmm?

00:26:03.767 --> 00:26:04.767 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:26:04.801 --> 00:26:08.033 position:7% line:89% align:start
So that's what they look like!

00:26:08.067 --> 00:26:10.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
How's this thing
supposed to work?

00:26:10.133 --> 00:26:12.200 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's no sail
to catch the wind, so...

00:26:12.234 --> 00:26:14.033 position:5% line:89% align:start
...how exactly do you propel it?

00:26:14.067 --> 00:26:14.968 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
I take it you're not
familiar with Dials.

00:26:17.167 --> 00:26:18.767 position:33% line:89% align:start
Not at all.

00:26:20.167 --> 00:26:21.534 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CONIS]
They're seashells like this.

00:26:21.567 --> 00:26:24.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
This one's kind of small,
but it's a Breath Dial.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.567 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's designed to store up wind

00:26:25.601 --> 00:26:27.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
and then blow it back out
to propel the Waver

00:26:27.601 --> 00:26:29.300 position:21% line:89% align:start
across the surface.

00:26:29.334 --> 00:26:30.434 position:41% line:89% align:start
Cool!

00:26:30.467 --> 00:26:31.601 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's really smart!

00:26:31.634 --> 00:26:32.667 position:38% line:89% align:start
See ya!

00:26:32.701 --> 00:26:34.200 position:19% line:89% align:start
Welp, there she goes!

00:26:34.234 --> 00:26:37.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is just like
a dream, so exciting!

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.534 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yahoo!

00:26:46.834 --> 00:26:48.267 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right!

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.801 position:24% line:89% align:start
I love this thing!

00:26:49.834 --> 00:26:51.801 position:13% line:83% align:start
Whatever. I can do it too!
Just watch!

00:26:51.834 --> 00:26:53.334 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:27:01.167 --> 00:27:02.200 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
Hmm?

00:27:02.234 --> 00:27:03.567 position:13% line:89% align:start
What's goin' on out there?

00:27:03.601 --> 00:27:06.067 position:5% line:89% align:start
He must have Devil-Fruit powers.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:08.033 position:5% line:89% align:start
This sea has no bottom, though.

00:27:08.067 --> 00:27:09.567 position:33% line:89% align:start
Wait, what?

00:27:09.601 --> 00:27:10.267 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
Nice work.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.300 position:5% line:89% align:start
You almost got yourself killed.

00:27:12.334 --> 00:27:15.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even up here, I gotta
worry about drowning.

00:27:15.734 --> 00:27:19.100 position:10% line:89% align:start
I never get to have any fun.

00:27:22.367 --> 00:27:23.267 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SATORI]
Heso.

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hello, criminals,
I've finally found you!

00:27:25.834 --> 00:27:26.567 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
Hmm?

00:27:26.601 --> 00:27:27.734 position:24% line:89% align:start
What did you say?

00:27:27.767 --> 00:27:28.300 position:30% line:89% align:start
What's wrong?

00:27:28.334 --> 00:27:30.434 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why are we criminals?

00:27:34.067 --> 00:27:36.734 position:27% line:89% align:start
And who are you?

00:27:36.767 --> 00:27:38.734 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, You can call me Satori!

00:27:38.767 --> 00:27:40.534 position:24% line:83% align:start
And it seems you
have entered this country

00:27:40.567 --> 00:27:41.801 position:21% line:89% align:start
without permission!

00:27:41.834 --> 00:27:43.501 position:33% line:83% align:start
Which is why
I have to punish you

00:27:43.534 --> 00:27:46.200 position:13% line:89% align:start
in the name of God Eneru!

00:27:46.234 --> 00:27:48.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
For he is a powerful
and omnipotent being

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.167 position:10% line:89% align:start
who watches over everything!

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:53.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
All of you will be
sacrifices unto him!

00:27:53.734 --> 00:27:56.334 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Cut the chit-chat already.

00:27:56.367 --> 00:27:57.200 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SATORI]
Huh?

00:27:57.234 --> 00:27:58.234 position:35% line:89% align:start
I get it.

00:27:58.267 --> 00:28:00.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
You came here to fight.

00:28:00.133 --> 00:28:02.167 position:33% line:89% align:start
So let's go.

00:28:02.601 --> 00:28:05.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
You nasty criminals
must be dealt with!

00:28:05.567 --> 00:28:08.267 position:44% line:89% align:start
Die!

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.801 position:19% line:89% align:start
Surprise Ball Attack!

00:28:09.834 --> 00:28:12.434 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ball Dragon!

00:28:12.467 --> 00:28:14.801 position:7% line:89% align:start
This shouldn't take too long!

00:28:14.834 --> 00:28:16.467 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh. You can stretch!

00:28:16.501 --> 00:28:19.200 position:35% line:89% align:start
Gum-Gum...

00:28:19.234 --> 00:28:20.767 position:35% line:89% align:start
...Pistol!

00:28:25.601 --> 00:28:27.067 position:35% line:89% align:start
Collier...

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:27.901 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see!

00:28:27.934 --> 00:28:30.200 position:30% line:83% align:start
An upper kick
with the right foot.

00:28:30.234 --> 00:28:31.267 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
...Shoot!

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.167 position:41% line:83% align:start
--Ugh!
--[SATORI] Whoopsie!

00:28:34.767 --> 00:28:36.133 position:35% line:89% align:start
No, Sanji!

00:28:36.167 --> 00:28:37.234 position:41% line:89% align:start
Luffy!

00:28:37.267 --> 00:28:39.567 position:38% line:89% align:start
[coughs]

00:28:40.133 --> 00:28:42.467 position:5% line:89% align:start
Whoa, how did he do that?

00:28:42.501 --> 00:28:45.033 position:7% line:89% align:start
The Divine Squad uses Mantra!

00:28:45.067 --> 00:28:47.067 position:30% line:89% align:start
What's Mantra?

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.634 position:10% line:89% align:start
What the hell just happened?

00:28:48.667 --> 00:28:51.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
He knew exactly what
move I was about to do!

00:28:51.367 --> 00:28:54.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah, and Luffy can't
be hit with a normal attack!

00:28:54.133 --> 00:28:55.501 position:21% line:89% align:start
I just don't get it!

00:28:55.534 --> 00:28:56.767 position:33% line:83% align:start
[GAN FALL]
It wasn't normal.

00:28:56.801 --> 00:28:58.334 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:28:58.367 --> 00:29:00.567 position:10% line:89% align:start
He's using the Impact Dial.

00:29:00.601 --> 00:29:02.367 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's not just a hit.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.167 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's an impact!

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.133 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SATORI]
Precisely!

00:29:05.167 --> 00:29:07.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
Which means that it
can destroy your body

00:29:07.234 --> 00:29:09.634 position:21% line:89% align:start
from the inside out!

00:29:09.667 --> 00:29:11.601 position:35% line:89% align:start
Damn you!

00:29:11.634 --> 00:29:13.501 position:35% line:89% align:start
Huh? Whoa!

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.534 position:24% line:83% align:start
--[NAMI] Chopper!
--[CONIS] Suu!

00:29:17.567 --> 00:29:20.667 position:30% line:83% align:start
Help, get me
off this thing!

00:29:27.434 --> 00:29:28.801 position:30% line:89% align:start
It took them!

00:29:28.834 --> 00:29:30.567 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's the Lobster Express!

00:29:30.601 --> 00:29:32.400 position:7% line:89% align:start
If we don't intercept it soon,

00:29:32.434 --> 00:29:34.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
then they'll be taken
to Upper Yard!

00:29:34.267 --> 00:29:35.601 position:16% line:89% align:start
Upper Yard, what's that?

00:29:35.634 --> 00:29:37.334 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's Eneru's island!

00:29:37.367 --> 00:29:40.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
We can't let them
reach the Sacrificial Altar!

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.334 position:35% line:89% align:start
We won't.

00:29:44.567 --> 00:29:46.601 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm borrowing the waver!

00:29:50.133 --> 00:29:52.133 position:27% line:83% align:start
She can't rescue
them by herself.

00:29:52.167 --> 00:29:53.601 position:24% line:89% align:start
Got another boat?

00:29:53.634 --> 00:29:55.167 position:35% line:89% align:start
This way!

00:29:55.667 --> 00:29:56.534 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Zoro!

00:29:56.567 --> 00:29:58.133 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
Hmm?

00:29:58.167 --> 00:30:00.100 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Look out for them.

00:30:00.133 --> 00:30:02.267 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll catch up to you later.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
After I beat this jerk!

00:30:05.133 --> 00:30:05.767 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
Hmph.

00:30:05.801 --> 00:30:07.400 position:33% line:89% align:start
Roger that.

00:30:33.267 --> 00:30:34.100 position:44% line:89% align:start
No!

00:30:34.133 --> 00:30:35.334 position:30% line:83% align:start
It would seem
Shura's headed straight

00:30:35.367 --> 00:30:37.234 position:13% line:89% align:start
for the Sacrificial Altar!

00:30:37.267 --> 00:30:38.267 position:41% line:89% align:start
Shura?

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:39.534 position:19% line:89% align:start
Is that a bad person?

00:30:39.567 --> 00:30:41.234 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yes, indeed!

00:30:41.267 --> 00:30:44.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
He's one of Eneru's vassals!

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.501 position:5% line:89% align:start
They call him "Sky Rider" Shura!

00:30:58.334 --> 00:31:00.367 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHURA]
Excellent.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.734 position:7% line:89% align:start
We've just reached the Altar.

00:31:02.767 --> 00:31:05.167 position:16% line:89% align:start
So look alive, you two.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.634 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're our sacrifices.

00:31:08.467 --> 00:31:09.467 position:30% line:89% align:start
Now surrender.

00:31:09.501 --> 00:31:11.300 position:38% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:31:11.334 --> 00:31:12.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
--[SHURA] I order you--
--[CHOPPER] I said no!

00:31:12.834 --> 00:31:14.667 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHURA]
That's enough, rat!

00:31:20.067 --> 00:31:21.434 position:24% line:89% align:start
All you do is run?

00:31:24.501 --> 00:31:25.267 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, no!

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.267 position:21% line:89% align:start
The ship's on fire!

00:31:28.167 --> 00:31:28.701 position:41% line:89% align:start
Stop!

00:31:28.734 --> 00:31:30.334 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't burn the Merry!

00:31:30.367 --> 00:31:32.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
You must be made
to see the extent

00:31:32.133 --> 00:31:34.033 position:19% line:89% align:start
of your shortcomings.

00:31:34.067 --> 00:31:37.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now offer up your
worthless life unto your God!

00:31:37.267 --> 00:31:39.200 position:33% line:89% align:start
I refuse to!

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.667 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:31:45.701 --> 00:31:47.000 position:35% line:89% align:start
Let me go!

00:31:48.667 --> 00:31:50.534 position:38% line:89% align:start
No, Suu!

00:31:53.801 --> 00:31:55.634 position:35% line:89% align:start
Farewell.

00:31:55.667 --> 00:31:58.400 position:38% line:89% align:start
Help me!

00:32:06.434 --> 00:32:08.734 position:35% line:83% align:start
[GAN FALL]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:32:09.167 --> 00:32:11.667 position:16% line:89% align:start
Sky Knight, you're here!

00:32:11.701 --> 00:32:12.200 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHURA]
Hmph.

00:32:12.234 --> 00:32:14.400 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hello, previous God.

00:32:19.267 --> 00:32:20.167 position:35% line:83% align:start
[GAN FALL]
Ah.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
It appears he's quite
a worthy opponent.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.133 position:30% line:83% align:start
Let's not hold
anything back, eh, Pierre?

00:32:26.334 --> 00:32:27.701 position:21% line:89% align:start
Curse you, Gan Fall!

00:32:27.734 --> 00:32:29.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
How dare you intrude
upon Upper Yard

00:32:29.501 --> 00:32:32.667 position:13% line:83% align:start
and attempt to interfere
with my righteous judgment?

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.634 position:19% line:89% align:start
Be careful Sky Knight!

00:32:41.267 --> 00:32:43.767 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nobody rebels against God Eneru!

00:32:48.367 --> 00:32:50.133 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SATORI] There's no telling
what might pop out!

00:32:50.167 --> 00:32:52.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's why they're
called Surprise Balls!

00:32:52.133 --> 00:32:54.167 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ha-ha-ha!

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.601 position:19% line:89% align:start
Surprise Cloud Strike!

00:32:55.634 --> 00:32:57.534 position:44% line:89% align:start
Go!

00:32:57.567 --> 00:32:59.167 position:21% line:89% align:start
Please don't hit me!

00:33:00.267 --> 00:33:02.367 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:33:05.267 --> 00:33:06.167 position:35% line:89% align:start
That's it?

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.167 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hmm. Looks like a dud.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:08.868 position:38% line:89% align:start
Damn it!

00:33:08.901 --> 00:33:11.334 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ugh! You scared me for nothing!

00:33:11.367 --> 00:33:12.567 position:35% line:89% align:start
Take this!

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:15.968 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, if you thought

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:16.868 position:16% line:83% align:start
that little false alarm
was frightening,

00:33:16.901 --> 00:33:18.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
then these Gunpowder
Balls are certain

00:33:18.667 --> 00:33:21.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
to give you a run
for your money!

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.033 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ball Dragon!

00:33:24.701 --> 00:33:25.100 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
Luffy, look out!

00:33:25.133 --> 00:33:26.701 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Uh-oh!

00:33:31.367 --> 00:33:32.300 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:33:32.334 --> 00:33:34.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why are you running
straight in front of it?

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.667 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah, you're right!

00:33:38.467 --> 00:33:40.334 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?

00:33:40.367 --> 00:33:43.467 position:35% line:89% align:start
[gasping]

00:33:43.501 --> 00:33:45.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh! He musta been
controllin' the balls

00:33:45.501 --> 00:33:47.267 position:13% line:89% align:start
with this piece of string!

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, this oughta
be easy to fix, then!

00:33:50.067 --> 00:33:52.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
Ah! I'll make you
pay for that impudence.

00:33:52.133 --> 00:33:54.367 position:5% line:89% align:start
Get over here, you little brat!

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.067 position:33% line:89% align:start
What the--?

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.300 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:33:57.334 --> 00:33:58.000 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:33:58.033 --> 00:33:59.601 position:5% line:89% align:start
You didn't let go of the dragon!

00:34:00.534 --> 00:34:03.501 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:34:17.801 --> 00:34:19.234 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SATORI]
That was close!

00:34:19.267 --> 00:34:21.267 position:19% line:89% align:start
What a hopeless idiot!

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.501 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're right, that
was pretty close, huh?

00:34:23.534 --> 00:34:24.434 position:33% line:89% align:start
Definitely.

00:34:24.467 --> 00:34:27.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hold on, what are
you still doing here?

00:34:27.334 --> 00:34:29.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
Get off of me right now,
you little fool!

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.734 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
Don't let go of him, Luffy!

00:34:35.367 --> 00:34:38.133 position:7% line:89% align:start
He's right where we want him.

00:34:38.167 --> 00:34:40.200 position:24% line:89% align:start
Loudmouthed fatso.

00:34:40.234 --> 00:34:42.100 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Sanji, I thought you were toast!

00:34:42.133 --> 00:34:44.300 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SANJI] Yeah, I almost was,
because of you!

00:34:44.334 --> 00:34:46.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
You've gotta start
payin' more attention!

00:34:46.467 --> 00:34:48.167 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm still alive too, by the way.

00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:51.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, in any case,
some helpless damsels

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:53.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
are waiting for me
to come to their rescue.

00:34:53.601 --> 00:34:56.534 position:21% line:89% align:start
Let's wrap this up,

00:34:56.567 --> 00:34:58.133 position:35% line:89% align:start
doughboy!

00:34:58.167 --> 00:35:00.601 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:35:00.634 --> 00:35:02.467 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SATORI]
Wait, we should talk about this!

00:35:02.501 --> 00:35:03.767 position:38% line:89% align:start
Don't--

00:35:03.801 --> 00:35:06.234 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
Concassé!

00:35:06.801 --> 00:35:09.567 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SATORI]
It's just not fair!

00:35:13.501 --> 00:35:15.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
[WYPER ] And are you
certain that's what your Mantra

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:17.501 position:10% line:89% align:start
is trying to tell you, Aisa?

00:35:17.534 --> 00:35:18.601 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AISA]
Yes.

00:35:18.634 --> 00:35:20.767 position:38% line:83% align:start
[WYPER]
One voice has gone silent?

00:35:20.801 --> 00:35:21.434 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AISA]
Yes.

00:35:21.467 --> 00:35:23.667 position:10% line:89% align:start
I think it was Satori, sir.

00:35:23.701 --> 00:35:26.567 position:33% line:83% align:start
And Shura's
the one who got hurt.

00:35:26.601 --> 00:35:28.501 position:33% line:89% align:start
Understood.

00:35:29.767 --> 00:35:31.601 position:19% line:89% align:start
Then now's our chance!

00:35:37.834 --> 00:35:40.467 position:27% line:83% align:start
Upper Yard is in
chaos at the moment!

00:35:40.501 --> 00:35:44.067 position:30% line:83% align:start
So this is the
perfect opportunity!

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.100 position:21% line:89% align:start
We do not fear Gods!

00:35:46.133 --> 00:35:47.601 position:7% line:89% align:start
We vowed to the Great Calgara

00:35:47.634 --> 00:35:50.234 position:30% line:83% align:start
to bring back
the Light of Shandora!

00:35:50.267 --> 00:35:51.601 position:30% line:83% align:start
[SHANDORIANS]
Right!

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:14.367 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wyper! You want us to stop them?

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.467 position:30% line:89% align:start
Leave them be.

00:36:15.501 --> 00:36:17.100 position:30% line:89% align:start
They can wait!

00:36:17.133 --> 00:36:19.167 position:10% line:89% align:start
We can't let this chance go!

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.100 position:27% line:89% align:start
They kept going.

00:36:25.133 --> 00:36:25.968 position:21% line:89% align:start
I suppose that means

00:36:26.033 --> 00:36:28.133 position:30% line:83% align:start
we're not the
targets they're after.

00:36:28.167 --> 00:36:30.601 position:10% line:83% align:start
You wouldn't happen to know
who they are, would you?

00:36:33.834 --> 00:36:35.334 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes, I do.

00:36:35.367 --> 00:36:36.734 position:27% line:89% align:start
The Shandorians.

00:36:43.334 --> 00:36:44.133 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CONIS]
They're a group that rebels

00:36:44.167 --> 00:36:47.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
against God Eneru
and his Vassals.

00:37:18.567 --> 00:37:20.267 position:21% line:89% align:start
That was too close!

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.634 position:19% line:89% align:start
I almost got involved.

00:37:50.501 --> 00:37:53.067 position:30% line:83% align:start
Is this place
what I think it is?

00:37:54.367 --> 00:37:56.434 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, no, Sky Knight!

00:37:56.467 --> 00:37:57.467 position:33% line:83% align:start
[GAN FALL]
What is this?

00:37:57.501 --> 00:37:59.033 position:30% line:89% align:start
I can't move!

00:38:01.667 --> 00:38:03.534 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:38:03.567 --> 00:38:05.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is there something
wrong, Gan Fall?

00:38:05.734 --> 00:38:08.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
I like to call this
my String Ordeal!

00:38:25.567 --> 00:38:28.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
You think you'll be
a match for me in mid-air?

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.634 position:33% line:89% align:start
Forget him.

00:38:34.667 --> 00:38:37.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you want a fight,
then I'm right here!

00:38:38.834 --> 00:38:40.400 position:27% line:89% align:start
An Impact Dial?

00:38:40.434 --> 00:38:42.234 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's not enough to win.

00:38:42.267 --> 00:38:43.467 position:38% line:83% align:start
[WYPER]
Oh, really?

00:38:43.501 --> 00:38:46.601 position:30% line:83% align:start
This one has
ten times the energy!

00:38:46.634 --> 00:38:48.501 position:24% line:89% align:start
Have some Reject!

00:38:53.567 --> 00:38:55.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
[NARRATOR] The Shandorians
have long been at war

00:38:55.367 --> 00:38:58.434 position:27% line:83% align:start
with the people
who live on the Sky Island.

00:38:59.801 --> 00:39:02.634 position:5% line:89% align:start
In fact, it began 400 years ago.

00:39:02.667 --> 00:39:04.267 position:13% line:89% align:start
The Great Warrior Calgara,

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
who was once in charge
of protecting Shandora,

00:39:06.834 --> 00:39:08.501 position:13% line:89% align:start
the shining City of Gold,

00:39:08.534 --> 00:39:11.267 position:30% line:83% align:start
crossed paths
with a certain man.

00:39:17.434 --> 00:39:19.367 position:5% line:89% align:start
Calgara was a courageous fighter

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
who would stop at nothing
to protect the Shandorians.

00:39:22.334 --> 00:39:24.234 position:41% line:83% align:start
He was
singlehandedly responsible

00:39:24.267 --> 00:39:28.267 position:7% line:89% align:start
for sinking many pirate ships.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:31.300 position:16% line:83% align:start
That year, the village
suffered from a poor harvest,

00:39:31.334 --> 00:39:35.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
and a disease spread like
wildfire among its inhabitants.

00:39:35.501 --> 00:39:38.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
The villagers feared that
an evil spirit was to blame

00:39:38.334 --> 00:39:40.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
and decided to make
an offering to Kashigami,

00:39:40.834 --> 00:39:44.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
a huge snake believed
to be their protective god.

00:39:44.067 --> 00:39:48.133 position:27% line:83% align:start
So they prepared
a young girl as a sacrifice.

00:39:48.167 --> 00:39:52.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
But, at the same time,
a visitor arrived on the island.

00:39:52.701 --> 00:39:55.634 position:5% line:89% align:start
His name was Mont Blanc Noland.

00:39:55.667 --> 00:39:56.767 position:16% line:89% align:start
Upon entering a forest,

00:39:56.801 --> 00:40:00.400 position:19% line:83% align:start

You!

Use that knife to kill yourself!

But why?

00:41:25.067 --> 00:41:26.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're a sacrifice
meant to save us,

and yet you selfishly cry

00:41:29.801 --> 00:41:32.267 position:30% line:89% align:start
How shameful!

00:41:33.667 --> 00:41:35.501 position:21% line:89% align:start
No, don't be a fool!

00:41:36.701 --> 00:41:38.434 position:35% line:89% align:start
Drop that!

00:41:38.467 --> 00:41:40.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
Your death will not
be a sufficient payment

00:41:40.334 --> 00:41:42.601 position:13% line:83% align:start
for the unspeakable crime
of murdering a god.

00:41:42.634 --> 00:41:46.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
Every one of your men

00:41:48.234 --> 00:41:49.334 position:30% line:89% align:start

"Killing" that!

When will your gods be happy?

00:41:52.834 --> 00:41:57.667 position:13% line:83% align:start
These ceremonies of yours
are an insult to humanity!

00:41:57.701 --> 00:42:00.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
Just give me some time!

00:42:00.133 --> 00:42:01.767 position:19% line:89% align:start
This so-called curse.

00:42:01.801 --> 00:42:04.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll get rid of it for you!

And if I should fail,

00:42:05.634 --> 00:42:09.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
then I'll leave you to do
things however you see fit!

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:11.100 position:30% line:89% align:start
If I succeed,

00:42:11.133 --> 00:42:14.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
I expect you to
make a solemn vow

00:42:14.133 --> 00:42:18.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
that you'll never

[NARRATOR] And so,
to save the village from crisis,

00:42:21.234 --> 00:42:24.033 position:5% line:89% align:start
Noland set off into the forest.

00:42:24.567 --> 00:42:28.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
But suddenly, an anomaly
appeared in the ground.

00:42:30.534 --> 00:42:31.434 position:27% line:89% align:start
To his surprise.

00:42:31.467 --> 00:42:34.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
Noland became firmly
trapped in a fissure

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:36.801 position:30% line:83% align:start
and was unable
to get himself free.

00:42:36.834 --> 00:42:39.267 position:7% line:89% align:start
Calgara, who believed in gods,

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:41.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
was convinced that this
unexpected turn of events

00:42:41.667 --> 00:42:45.167 position:30% line:83% align:start
must have been
divine intervention.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.167 position:7% line:89% align:start
You can't sacrifice that girl!

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.267 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's less than human!

00:42:50.834 --> 00:42:53.767 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CALGARA]
Do you think so?

00:42:53.801 --> 00:42:57.167 position:27% line:83% align:start
Even if the girl
you saved yesterday...

00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:00.334 position:5% line:89% align:start
...was my own precious daughter?

00:43:00.367 --> 00:43:01.300 position:38% line:89% align:start
Monster!

00:43:01.334 --> 00:43:03.200 position:13% line:89% align:start
Is nothing sacred to you?

00:43:03.234 --> 00:43:04.601 position:21% line:89% align:start
Not even your child?

00:43:04.634 --> 00:43:06.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
You people don't
understand how much power

00:43:06.467 --> 00:43:08.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
there is in the words
that our Pandori hear

00:43:08.601 --> 00:43:10.133 position:13% line:89% align:start
from the all-knowing gods!

00:43:10.167 --> 00:43:12.701 position:5% line:89% align:start
There's nothing else we can do!

00:43:12.734 --> 00:43:15.300 position:7% line:89% align:start
I cannot expect an exception!

00:43:15.334 --> 00:43:18.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yes, she's my child,
but that's no excuse!

[NOLAND]
You think I don't understand?

00:43:26.667 --> 00:43:28.167 position:21% line:89% align:start
Just listen to this!

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.234 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sixty years ago,

00:43:29.267 --> 00:43:31.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
my own land lost hundreds
of thousands of lives

00:43:31.601 --> 00:43:34.667 position:24% line:83% align:start
to the same plague
ravaging your village!

00:43:34.701 --> 00:43:36.467 position:5% line:89% align:start
However, in the past few years,

00:43:36.501 --> 00:43:38.767 position:7% line:89% align:start
no one's died to this disease!

00:43:38.801 --> 00:43:42.434 position:16% line:89% align:start
Do you know why that is?

00:43:42.467 --> 00:43:46.501 position:24% line:83% align:start
It was because we
discovered a cure for it!

00:43:46.534 --> 00:43:48.434 position:27% line:83% align:start
What I'm holding
in my right hand

00:43:48.467 --> 00:43:51.167 position:10% line:89% align:start
is the bark of a Cona tree!

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:56.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
It has Conine, and I can
extract it to make the cure!

00:43:56.067 --> 00:44:00.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
If I return with this,
I can save you all!

Do you have any
idea how much time

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:05.767 position:13% line:89% align:start
and effort has been spent,

00:44:05.801 --> 00:44:08.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
and how many things
have changed for the better

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:11.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
as a direct result of
mankind's hard work?

00:44:11.534 --> 00:44:14.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
The way you bargain

in the face to everything
that's been accomplished!

your sacrificial "ceremonies"

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:22.167 position:10% line:89% align:start
were an insult to humanity!

So stop them!

Answer me this.

If you speak the truth,
what did I just kill?

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:43.267 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NOLAND]
A snake.

[CALGARA]
Wrong!

00:44:44.734 --> 00:44:46.467 position:30% line:83% align:start
I just broke
our holy commandments

00:44:46.501 --> 00:44:49.234 position:10% line:89% align:start
and slaughtered a great god!

00:44:49.267 --> 00:44:52.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
You dare to call it
a mere snake, but it isn't!

00:44:52.334 --> 00:44:53.267 position:19% line:89% align:start
No more than the curse

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:57.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
that kills my people
is a curable disease!

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.667 position:13% line:89% align:start
Will you save my village?

00:45:00.701 --> 00:45:04.200 position:13% line:83% align:start
Are you certain that such
a thing is even possible?

00:45:04.234 --> 00:45:04.801 position:38% line:89% align:start
Tell me.

00:45:04.834 --> 00:45:07.167 position:33% line:89% align:start
Promise me!

00:45:07.834 --> 00:45:09.667 position:38% line:89% align:start

Cha-la-la-la-la!

00:45:14.734 --> 00:45:15.634 position:30% line:89% align:start
How shocking!

00:45:15.667 --> 00:45:19.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
I had no idea that
snake had a grandchild.

00:45:19.234 --> 00:45:21.634 position:27% line:89% align:start

[CALGARA] This bell's

Words?

[CALGARA]
Yes.

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:50.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
It is a signal to the
spirits of our ancestors

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:52.801 position:13% line:83% align:start
who have gone on before us
to greet the heavens.

00:45:52.834 --> 00:45:54.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
We wish for them to be

to this place at any moment.

00:45:56.567 --> 00:45:59.200 position:24% line:83% align:start
And so, whenever
we ring this golden bell,

00:45:59.234 --> 00:46:01.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
we're sending them
a simple message.

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.400 position:7% line:89% align:start

It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:46:05.334 --> 00:46:08.067 position:33% line:83% align:start
It's called
"The Light of Shandora."

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:09.267 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.467 position:30% line:83% align:start
No wonder its
sound is so strong.

00:46:11.501 --> 00:46:12.667 position:27% line:89% align:start
Do you think so?

00:46:12.701 --> 00:46:13.801 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes!

00:46:13.834 --> 00:46:17.200 position:24% line:83% align:start
I heard it during
a terrible storm.

00:46:17.234 --> 00:46:21.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
And it takes a powerful

00:46:22.267 --> 00:46:23.167 position:33% line:83% align:start
[NARRATOR]
Noland and his people thought

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
that the two groups
were on good terms.

00:46:25.767 --> 00:46:27.501 position:30% line:83% align:start

being rejected
by the Shandorians.

00:46:30.767 --> 00:46:32.667 position:27% line:83% align:start
The reason was
that Noland and his men

had cut down several Ancestor

precious to the villagers.

But that was a misunderstanding.

00:46:44.734 --> 00:46:47.601 position:27% line:83% align:start
Their ancestors'
spirits dwell within them.

00:46:47.634 --> 00:46:49.467 position:21% line:89% align:start
I understand it now.

00:46:49.501 --> 00:46:52.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
We've done an awful thing
that cannot be undone.

00:46:52.767 --> 00:46:55.501 position:16% line:83% align:start
The villagers are right
to be angry with us.

00:46:55.534 --> 00:46:56.767 position:35% line:83% align:start
[DOCTOR]
But, Admiral!

00:46:56.801 --> 00:46:58.234 position:5% line:89% align:start
What else could we have done--?

00:46:58.267 --> 00:47:00.067 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NOLAND]
There's no excuse!

00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:04.033 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was just doing what would
serve my own selfish desires!

00:47:04.067 --> 00:47:06.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
I was told that the
golden bell not only proclaimed

00:47:06.567 --> 00:47:07.667 position:19% line:89% align:start
the city's existence,

00:47:07.701 --> 00:47:11.067 position:5% line:83% align:start
but also guided their ancestors'
spirits to the island,

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:13.300 position:19% line:83% align:start
where they could rest
in the Ancestor Trees.

00:47:13.334 --> 00:47:16.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
And now we've gone
and destroyed every last one.

00:47:16.367 --> 00:47:19.267 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's unforgivable!

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:20.601 position:35% line:83% align:start
[SAILORS]
What?

00:47:20.634 --> 00:47:24.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
You want us to leave
all the gold behind?

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:24.801 position:38% line:89% align:start
Father!

00:47:24.834 --> 00:47:25.801 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hurry.

00:47:25.834 --> 00:47:27.434 position:10% line:89% align:start
You can't let them set sail!

00:47:27.467 --> 00:47:30.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's nonsense, you know
full well what they did!

00:47:30.334 --> 00:47:31.467 position:16% line:89% align:start
But if we part ways now,

00:47:31.501 --> 00:47:34.334 position:7% line:89% align:start
then we'll regret it forever!

00:47:34.367 --> 00:47:36.601 position:38% line:83% align:start
[DOCTOR]
Listen.

00:47:36.634 --> 00:47:38.534 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm saying this
in honor of the Admiral,

00:47:38.567 --> 00:47:40.701 position:24% line:89% align:start
not as an excuse.

00:47:40.734 --> 00:47:42.400 position:30% line:83% align:start
Those woods of
yours were dead long

00:47:42.434 --> 00:47:44.567 position:13% line:89% align:start
before they were cut down.

00:47:44.601 --> 00:47:46.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
The Kinetsu plague may
have caused several deaths

00:47:46.634 --> 00:47:48.534 position:7% line:89% align:start
by infecting humans directly,

00:47:48.567 --> 00:47:50.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
but the true horror
of the disease

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:52.767 position:30% line:83% align:start
is that it can
infect plant life as well.

00:47:52.801 --> 00:47:55.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
The Admiral was already
aware of that fact,

00:47:55.601 --> 00:47:56.634 position:5% line:89% align:start
which is why he pleaded with you

00:47:56.667 --> 00:47:59.334 position:5% line:89% align:start
without regard for his own life.

00:47:59.367 --> 00:48:02.200 position:19% line:83% align:start
From people to forest,
forest to people.

00:48:02.234 --> 00:48:03.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
Many small islands
like this have been

00:48:03.567 --> 00:48:06.601 position:24% line:83% align:start
wiped off the map
in the exact same way.

00:48:06.634 --> 00:48:08.534 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:48:10.067 --> 00:48:12.467 position:10% line:83% align:start
[DOCTOR] But there's nothing
to worry about now.

00:48:12.501 --> 00:48:13.300 position:38% line:89% align:start
You see.

00:48:13.334 --> 00:48:16.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
We checked the
whole forest yesterday.

00:48:16.133 --> 00:48:19.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry that we didn't
explain things before.

00:48:19.133 --> 00:48:22.100 position:33% line:83% align:start
I know we've
caused you a lot of grief.

00:48:22.133 --> 00:48:25.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's probably still unforgivable
even with an explanation,

00:48:25.167 --> 00:48:27.534 position:27% line:83% align:start
but a botanist
would never harm a forest

00:48:27.567 --> 00:48:30.334 position:19% line:89% align:start
without a good reason.

00:48:30.367 --> 00:48:31.334 position:24% line:89% align:start
I should tell you.

00:48:31.367 --> 00:48:34.734 position:19% line:83% align:start
Admiral Noland doesn't
hate gods or spirits.

00:48:37.734 --> 00:48:41.467 position:10% line:83% align:start
[DOCTOR] He just focuses on
what's most important.

00:48:41.501 --> 00:48:43.601 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's his way.

00:48:45.534 --> 00:48:47.734 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CALGARA]
I'm so sorry, Noland!

00:48:47.767 --> 00:48:49.501 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't go yet!

00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:57.000 position:33% line:83% align:start
[NARRATOR]
At that moment,

00:48:57.033 --> 00:48:59.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
the bell rang out
loudly across the land,

00:48:59.734 --> 00:49:02.334 position:10% line:83% align:start
as though it were trying to
rebuild a precious friendship

00:49:02.367 --> 00:49:06.033 position:10% line:83% align:start
that was almost lost to an
unfortunate misunderstanding.

00:49:06.067 --> 00:49:10.000 position:30% line:83% align:start
And the sound
was quite beautiful.

00:49:17.067 --> 00:49:19.467 position:38% line:89% align:start
Noland!

00:49:19.501 --> 00:49:22.334 position:24% line:89% align:start
Calgara, it's you!

00:49:24.234 --> 00:49:26.667 position:24% line:89% align:start
Come back someday!

00:49:30.133 --> 00:49:32.267 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CALGARA]
Noland.

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:37.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
I swear, I'll always
be waiting for you!

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:40.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
And I'll keep ringing
the Light of Shandora!

00:49:40.467 --> 00:49:43.133 position:30% line:83% align:start
Until the day
when we meet again!

00:49:43.167 --> 00:49:45.400 position:24% line:83% align:start
So that you don't
get lost at sea!

00:49:45.434 --> 00:49:48.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
You'll know where
we are in the storm!

00:49:48.133 --> 00:49:50.067 position:16% line:89% align:start
Please! Come back soon!

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:51.467 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll remember you!

00:49:51.501 --> 00:49:53.701 position:38% line:89% align:start
Forever!

00:50:02.434 --> 00:50:06.300 position:5% line:83% align:start
[CALGARA] Until next time then,
my dearest friend!

00:50:06.334 --> 00:50:08.334 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'll be waiting!

00:50:11.434 --> 00:50:15.400 position:35% line:83% align:start
[NOLAND]
He wants me to come back.

00:50:18.834 --> 00:50:20.501 position:24% line:89% align:start
Well then, I will!

00:50:20.534 --> 00:50:23.000 position:27% line:89% align:start
I swear, friend!

00:50:27.734 --> 00:50:29.367 position:24% line:89% align:start
We'll meet again!

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:34.334 position:30% line:89% align:start
I promise you!

00:50:43.701 --> 00:50:44.701 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Hey, look!

00:50:44.734 --> 00:50:45.667 position:33% line:89% align:start
Over there!

00:50:45.701 --> 00:50:47.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
The Going Merry!

00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:49.667 position:16% line:89% align:start
My Nami and Robin, too!

00:50:49.701 --> 00:50:51.334 position:16% line:89% align:start
And that other hot babe!

00:50:51.367 --> 00:50:53.133 position:10% line:89% align:start
Looks like everybody's okay!

00:50:53.167 --> 00:50:55.000 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CHOPPER]
Hey!

00:50:59.734 --> 00:51:01.601 position:21% line:83% align:start
[NAMI] According to
Noland's picture book,

00:51:01.634 --> 00:51:04.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
whenever he made it back
to visit Jaya years later,

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:07.400 position:24% line:83% align:start
the golden ruins
were nowhere to be found.

00:51:11.234 --> 00:51:14.100 position:7% line:89% align:start
And now we know what happened.

00:51:14.133 --> 00:51:17.400 position:5% line:83% align:start
Before you guys came back, Zoro,
Robin, and I went to check.

00:51:20.334 --> 00:51:22.400 position:30% line:89% align:start
Look at this!

00:51:22.434 --> 00:51:24.133 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ROBIN]
Is that?

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:31.601 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
It's part of the City of Gold

00:51:31.634 --> 00:51:33.601 position:5% line:89% align:start
that once existed on the ground!

00:51:33.634 --> 00:51:35.367 position:16% line:89% align:start
The one that Noland saw!

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:38.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
It didn't submerge
into the ocean!

00:51:38.067 --> 00:51:40.100 position:30% line:89% align:start
For 400 years.

00:51:45.133 --> 00:51:50.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
This part of Jaya
has been up in the sky!

00:51:50.601 --> 00:51:53.400 position:13% line:83% align:start
This is the other half of
the island that was ripped up!

00:51:53.434 --> 00:51:55.367 position:19% line:89% align:start
It was a part of Jaya!

00:52:02.567 --> 00:52:07.501 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's how Jaya
looked four centuries ago!

00:52:07.534 --> 00:52:08.601 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
Oh, wow!

00:52:08.634 --> 00:52:10.267 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's shaped like a skull!

00:52:15.234 --> 00:52:16.067 position:38% line:89% align:start
Get it?

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:17.100 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
Amazing!

00:52:17.133 --> 00:52:18.200 position:21% line:89% align:start
In Noland's report,

00:52:18.234 --> 00:52:20.567 position:21% line:83% align:start
he was referring to
the shape of the whole island.

00:52:20.601 --> 00:52:23.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
But now only half of
its mass is still intact!

00:52:23.467 --> 00:52:25.701 position:27% line:83% align:start
So nobody ever
solved the mystery!

00:52:25.734 --> 00:52:26.701 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
That makes sense.

00:52:26.734 --> 00:52:29.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
[USOPP] So when he said,
"the skull's right eye."

00:52:29.467 --> 00:52:31.400 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
He meant this!

00:52:31.434 --> 00:52:34.334 position:27% line:83% align:start
"I saw gold in
the skull's right eye."

00:52:34.367 --> 00:52:35.701 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Treasure!

00:52:35.734 --> 00:52:37.133 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
We did it!

00:52:37.167 --> 00:52:38.067 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughter]

00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:39.767 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
Way to go, Nami!

00:52:39.801 --> 00:52:43.701 position:19% line:89% align:start
[CREW laughs, cheers]

00:52:59.834 --> 00:53:02.200 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ENERU]
A lovely morning.

00:53:02.234 --> 00:53:03.067 position:16% line:89% align:start
I no longer have to hear

00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:05.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
the voices of that
lower-world trash.

00:53:05.601 --> 00:53:07.334 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's so peaceful.

00:53:07.367 --> 00:53:08.567 position:33% line:89% align:start
And you two.

00:53:08.601 --> 00:53:12.300 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know you're just killing time
here, but you're too careless.

00:53:12.334 --> 00:53:15.300 position:16% line:89% align:start
Like Satori--and Shura,

00:53:15.334 --> 00:53:16.300 position:19% line:89% align:start
If you don't shape up,

00:53:16.334 --> 00:53:18.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
then I won't take you
to the Endless Vearth,

00:53:18.467 --> 00:53:21.400 position:16% line:89% align:start
and you don't want that!

00:53:21.434 --> 00:53:22.467 position:16% line:89% align:start
You mean it's complete?

00:53:22.501 --> 00:53:25.334 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:53:25.367 --> 00:53:29.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now then, let's play
the game, shall we?

00:53:29.534 --> 00:53:31.667 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Look at the map, you guys.

00:53:31.701 --> 00:53:33.067 position:21% line:89% align:start
Here's where we are.

00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:35.033 position:27% line:83% align:start
The search team
will go this way.

00:53:35.067 --> 00:53:37.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
There should be some ruins
in the right eye there.

00:53:37.334 --> 00:53:39.267 position:10% line:89% align:start
So let's grab some treasure

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:41.667 position:16% line:83% align:start
and try not to run into
any trouble, okay?

00:53:41.701 --> 00:53:43.601 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
You make it sound easy.

00:53:46.634 --> 00:53:47.567 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right!

00:53:47.601 --> 00:53:49.133 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's time to get goin'!

00:53:49.167 --> 00:53:50.000 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CHOPPER]
Yeah!

00:53:50.033 --> 00:53:52.267 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
You're in a good mood, Chopper!

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:54.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
[CHOPPER] That's because
I thought this forest

00:53:54.133 --> 00:53:55.400 position:19% line:89% align:start

not that bad, after all!

[LUFFY]
Run away, it's a giant snake!

00:54:21.734 --> 00:54:23.400 position:19% line:89% align:start
That thing's enormous!

00:54:23.434 --> 00:54:25.667 position:13% line:89% align:start
How does it move so fast?

00:54:33.767 --> 00:54:34.901 position:38% line:89% align:start
Poison?

00:54:34.934 --> 00:54:37.567 position:10% line:83% align:start
[ZORO] Yeah, I think that's
our cue to get outta here.

00:54:37.601 --> 00:54:39.300 position:27% line:89% align:start
I firmly agree.

[GAN FALL]
No one knows for sure,

00:54:42.467 --> 00:54:44.467 position:27% line:83% align:start
but it is widely
said that Upper Yard

00:54:44.501 --> 00:54:48.200 position:13% line:83% align:start
first appeared in Skypiea
some 400 years ago.

00:54:48.234 --> 00:54:49.801 position:13% line:89% align:start
And before that happened,

00:54:49.834 --> 00:54:53.667 position:24% line:83% align:start
Skypiea was always
a peaceful place.

00:54:53.701 --> 00:54:56.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
Items from the Blue Sea
would sporadically

00:54:56.267 --> 00:54:58.534 position:27% line:83% align:start
arrive here via
the Monsterous Current,

00:54:58.567 --> 00:55:01.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
and many of them were very
valuable to the Skypieans.

00:55:01.601 --> 00:55:03.200 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, but who?

00:55:03.234 --> 00:55:04.567 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's the name
for those of us

00:55:04.601 --> 00:55:06.667 position:10% line:89% align:start
who reside here in Skypiea.

00:55:06.701 --> 00:55:07.567 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:55:07.601 --> 00:55:09.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
That was the way
that all of the terrain

00:55:09.734 --> 00:55:13.667 position:7% line:83% align:start
making up the Sky Islands came
to rest up here in the sky.

00:55:13.701 --> 00:55:17.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
However, a piece of land
as large as Upper Yard

00:55:17.734 --> 00:55:20.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
was something of an
unprecedented miracle.

00:55:20.701 --> 00:55:21.868 position:33% line:89% align:start
As you know,

00:55:21.901 --> 00:55:26.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
neither greenery nor soil
is naturally found in the sky.

00:55:26.133 --> 00:55:28.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
That is why we refer
to the land as "Vearth,"

00:55:28.667 --> 00:55:32.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
a word that carries a
sense of awe and admiration.

00:55:32.367 --> 00:55:33.033 position:35% line:89% align:start
Of course.

00:55:33.067 --> 00:55:34.801 position:5% line:89% align:start
As for the ones who were shot up

00:55:34.834 --> 00:55:36.667 position:24% line:83% align:start
into the sky along
with the Vearth,

00:55:36.701 --> 00:55:38.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
they became known
as Shandorians,

00:55:38.601 --> 00:55:42.067 position:10% line:83% align:start
an indigenous people who now
make their home on Upper Yard.

00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:44.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
So the guerrilla group
you're talking about.

00:55:44.367 --> 00:55:46.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're saying that they used
to live in the world below,

00:55:46.567 --> 00:55:47.534 position:30% line:89% align:start
back on Jaya?

00:55:47.567 --> 00:55:48.367 position:21% line:89% align:start
And for some reason,

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:52.067 position:27% line:83% align:start
you guys kicked
them off the island?

00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:53.334 position:38% line:89% align:start
Correct.

00:55:53.367 --> 00:55:55.701 position:30% line:83% align:start
The Skypieans
captured their territory

00:55:55.734 --> 00:55:59.100 position:7% line:89% align:start
out of nothing but pure greed.

00:55:59.133 --> 00:56:02.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
And now, the Shandorians
are simply trying

00:56:02.167 --> 00:56:04.501 position:10% line:89% align:start
to take back their homeland.

00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:12.434 position:41% line:83% align:start

You've turned

00:57:15.767 --> 00:57:18.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
that monstrous Eneru
suddenly showed up here

unannounced from
some unknown Sky Island.

And he took control
of Upper Yard.

He and his men brutally
defeated my warriors,

Argh!

01:02:18.767 --> 01:02:20.234 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CHOPPER]
Ruins up here, too?

01:02:20.267 --> 01:02:21.601 position:21% line:89% align:start
This place is crazy!

01:02:21.634 --> 01:02:24.534 position:19% line:83% align:start
And why is the ground
all weird and crooked?

01:02:28.634 --> 01:02:30.167 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CHOPPER]
Huh?

01:02:38.434 --> 01:02:41.300 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ENERU]
What are you looking for there?

01:02:41.334 --> 01:02:44.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
If it's the gold you're
after, it's long gone.

01:02:44.767 --> 01:02:47.367 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ROBIN]
Explains why I can't find any.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.734 position:5% line:89% align:start
I assume it was you who took it?

01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:51.567 position:27% line:89% align:start
I do like gold.

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's a brilliant
and valuable metal,

01:02:53.334 --> 01:02:56.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
so I find that it suits me
quite appropriately.

01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:57.200 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

01:02:57.234 --> 01:02:59.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
Then you probably took
the golden bell that was here.

01:02:59.701 --> 01:03:01.634 position:19% line:89% align:start
Golden bell, you say?

01:03:03.067 --> 01:03:05.033 position:38% line:89% align:start
Duuuoo!

01:03:05.067 --> 01:03:05.901 position:35% line:89% align:start
Let me go!

01:03:05.934 --> 01:03:07.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
Or I'll pluck all
your feathers out!

01:03:09.567 --> 01:03:11.100 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

01:03:11.734 --> 01:03:15.334 position:30% line:89% align:start
[ZORO screams]

01:03:20.734 --> 01:03:23.300 position:30% line:83% align:start
[ZORO groans]
That hurt.

01:03:23.334 --> 01:03:26.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
Gah, that bird-brain's
gonna pay!

01:03:26.367 --> 01:03:28.467 position:41% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

01:03:28.501 --> 01:03:29.701 position:38% line:89% align:start
Chopper!

01:03:29.734 --> 01:03:31.701 position:41% line:83% align:start
[OHM]
Shame, isn't it?

01:03:31.734 --> 01:03:35.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
I suppose you want
to get revenge now.

01:03:36.334 --> 01:03:37.501 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
No.

01:03:37.534 --> 01:03:41.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't like fighting over
things that are already done.

01:03:42.634 --> 01:03:44.634 position:33% line:89% align:start
But for you,

01:03:44.667 --> 01:03:47.267 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll think I'll
make an exception.

01:03:50.167 --> 01:03:52.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
The Dial Boat in the
back seems worn out.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.634 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna go check it.

01:03:53.667 --> 01:03:55.601 position:24% line:89% align:start
Right, good idea.

01:04:02.801 --> 01:04:04.434 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Hmm?

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.234 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:04:15.801 --> 01:04:18.467 position:41% line:89% align:start
Nami?

01:04:18.501 --> 01:04:21.667 position:30% line:89% align:start
[NAMI screams]

01:04:25.234 --> 01:04:26.367 position:44% line:89% align:start
No!

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.300 position:38% line:89% align:start
Go away!

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:32.234 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

01:04:32.267 --> 01:04:33.767 position:16% line:89% align:start
Right, the golden bell!

01:04:33.801 --> 01:04:35.767 position:16% line:89% align:start
So you read the letters.

01:04:35.801 --> 01:04:37.434 position:21% line:89% align:start
What did you learn?

01:04:37.467 --> 01:04:39.234 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ROBIN]
Well, unfortunately,

01:04:39.267 --> 01:04:42.534 position:7% line:83% align:start
if you didn't see it anywhere
when you first arrived.

01:04:42.567 --> 01:04:47.334 position:24% line:83% align:start
That must mean it
never got to the sky.

01:04:47.367 --> 01:04:50.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
Actually, yes, it did.

01:04:50.267 --> 01:04:54.200 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm positive that bell's
somewhere up here.

01:04:54.234 --> 01:04:55.200 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:04:55.234 --> 01:04:57.634 position:27% line:83% align:start
The story goes,
when this island was propelled

01:04:57.667 --> 01:05:01.367 position:10% line:83% align:start
into the sky 400 years ago,
a bell could be heard.

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:02.501 position:21% line:89% align:start
It makes sense now!

01:05:02.534 --> 01:05:05.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
The bell they heard ring
must've been made out of gold!

01:05:05.467 --> 01:05:07.234 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

01:05:07.267 --> 01:05:09.200 position:16% line:89% align:start
 That's just wonderful!

taken aim at your heart.

01:05:20.634 --> 01:05:22.501 position:41% line:83% align:start

I'm gonna pray to him?

01:05:26.234 --> 01:05:29.000 position:19% line:89% align:start

That big snake's acting funny.

What's wrong with that bird?

01:07:58.501 --> 01:08:00.133 position:5% line:89% align:start
He must've hit his head too hard

01:08:00.167 --> 01:08:02.267 position:21% line:89% align:start
when he made impact.

01:08:06.601 --> 01:08:09.567 position:16% line:89% align:start
Could it be... possible?

01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:23.400 position:30% line:83% align:start

Huh?

01:08:42.334 --> 01:08:44.067 position:38% line:83% align:start
[WYPER]
What game?

01:08:50.701 --> 01:08:53.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, I started a
game of survival,

01:08:53.667 --> 01:08:56.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
and we're almost
at the three-hour mark.

01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
My guess was that there
would be five left standing,

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:01.234 position:10% line:89% align:start
including myself, of course.

01:09:01.267 --> 01:09:03.067 position:38% line:83% align:start

Five people besides me.

noticed I'm here!

In three minutes,

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:08.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
the three hour time
limit I set will be up.

01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:10.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
So obviously that means
we need to do something

01:09:10.501 --> 01:09:13.300 position:10% line:83% align:start
about the fact that we still
have six people in play.

Crap, he does know!

Which player should be
the one disappear?

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:26.634 position:33% line:83% align:start
[ALL FOUR]
I think it should be you!

01:09:26.667 --> 01:09:28.534 position:24% line:89% align:start
A foolish choice.

01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:34.367 position:7% line:89% align:start
This snake is such a nuisance.

01:09:35.701 --> 01:09:37.334 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ENERU]
El Thor!

01:09:55.634 --> 01:09:57.467 position:21% line:89% align:start
A Devil Fruit, huh?

01:09:57.501 --> 01:09:58.501 position:41% line:89% align:start
Maybe.

01:09:58.534 --> 01:10:00.100 position:30% line:89% align:start
If you ask me,

01:10:00.133 --> 01:10:02.133 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'd guess the
Rumble-Rumble Fruit.

01:10:02.167 --> 01:10:04.167 position:30% line:83% align:start
That one has
lightning-based abilities

doing all of this?

Because there's somewhere
I need to return to soon.

01:10:22.334 --> 01:10:24.133 position:13% line:89% align:start
There's a place for land,

That's right!

Humans have no place in the sky,

[GAN FALL]
You murderer!

01:10:44.367 --> 01:10:45.767 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's only natural.

01:10:47.601 --> 01:10:49.534 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't be so conceited!

01:10:49.567 --> 01:10:51.567 position:13% line:89% align:start
This is a world of humans!

01:10:51.601 --> 01:10:54.100 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're no better!

01:10:54.133 --> 01:10:56.400 position:19% line:89% align:start
20 Million Volt Vari.

01:11:06.601 --> 01:11:10.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
[ENERU] Good. Time's up
and we're down to five.

01:11:10.167 --> 01:11:12.367 position:21% line:89% align:start
Just as I foretold.

01:11:21.267 --> 01:11:23.033 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

01:11:23.067 --> 01:11:25.033 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm glad that you all survived!

01:11:25.067 --> 01:11:26.234 position:10% line:89% align:start
Now it's finally time for me

01:11:26.267 --> 01:11:28.200 position:24% line:83% align:start
to set off toward
the Endless Vearth,

01:11:28.234 --> 01:11:32.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
and you lucky five
are coming with me!

01:11:32.334 --> 01:11:35.234 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ROBIN]
And what if we refuse?

01:11:35.267 --> 01:11:36.334 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?

01:11:36.367 --> 01:11:38.701 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yeah, none of us have agreed
to go anywhere with you.

01:11:38.734 --> 01:11:40.300 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're in our way.

01:11:40.334 --> 01:11:42.634 position:19% line:89% align:start
We just want you gone!

01:11:42.667 --> 01:11:44.667 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ENERU]
Well, that's a shame.

01:11:44.701 --> 01:11:48.501 position:30% line:83% align:start
I guess you'll
just have to die here.

01:11:50.234 --> 01:11:51.734 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Robin!

[ZORO]
She's a woman!

01:12:07.234 --> 01:12:09.300 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yes, I can see that.

01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:12.467 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

01:12:12.501 --> 01:12:16.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm sure you don't fathom
the difference in our strength,

01:12:16.334 --> 01:12:18.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
so please allow me
to demonstrate for you.

[ZORO grunts]

01:12:23.334 --> 01:12:25.634 position:24% line:89% align:start
Now, Burn Bazooka!

01:12:25.667 --> 01:12:27.000 position:41% line:89% align:start
Kari!

01:12:36.367 --> 01:12:39.200 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

01:12:39.234 --> 01:12:40.667 position:30% line:89% align:start
What was that?

01:12:40.701 --> 01:12:43.701 position:10% line:83% align:start
He just erased my bazooka's
fire like it was nothing!

01:12:43.734 --> 01:12:45.300 position:13% line:89% align:start
You don't get it, do you?

01:12:45.334 --> 01:12:47.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
This insignificant
amount of energy

01:12:47.133 --> 01:12:48.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
that would obliterate you

01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:51.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
doesn't even put the
slightest scratch on me.

01:12:54.601 --> 01:12:58.534 position:10% line:89% align:start
Have a 30 Million Volt Hino!

And, Kiten!

01:13:23.601 --> 01:13:25.501 position:33% line:89% align:start
Impossible.

01:13:25.534 --> 01:13:27.434 position:35% line:89% align:start
Even Zoro?

01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:40.601 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ENERU]
Follow me.

01:13:40.634 --> 01:13:43.200 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'll show you
something interesting.

01:13:54.634 --> 01:13:56.234 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

01:13:58.400 --> 01:13:59.801 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ENERU]
The Ark Maxim!

01:13:59.834 --> 01:14:02.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
A magnificent vessel
that will take us straight

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:03.767 position:19% line:89% align:start
to the Endless Vearth!

01:14:03.801 --> 01:14:09.801 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

01:14:09.834 --> 01:14:11.434 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh no.

01:14:13.734 --> 01:14:14.634 position:38% line:83% align:start

Huh?

I'm free!

01:14:32.467 --> 01:14:33.734 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oooh?!

01:14:33.767 --> 01:14:35.033 position:38% line:89% align:start
Awesome!

01:14:35.067 --> 01:14:37.200 position:21% line:89% align:start
What is this place?

01:14:39.133 --> 01:14:40.434 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Ruins?

01:14:40.467 --> 01:14:41.734 position:21% line:89% align:start
Come to think of it.

01:14:41.767 --> 01:14:44.367 position:10% line:89% align:start
That gold bell must be here!

01:14:54.067 --> 01:14:55.167 position:41% line:89% align:start
Zoro!

01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:58.400 position:30% line:83% align:start
What's wrong,
why are you all beat up?

01:14:58.434 --> 01:15:00.734 position:19% line:89% align:start
I said to protect 'em!

01:15:00.767 --> 01:15:03.501 position:5% line:89% align:start
How'd this happen with you here?

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:05.701 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ROBIN]
Luffy.

01:15:05.734 --> 01:15:07.634 position:41% line:89% align:start
Robin!

01:15:07.667 --> 01:15:11.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
That awful man
took the navigator.

01:15:11.133 --> 01:15:13.067 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:15:13.701 --> 01:15:15.367 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ENERU]
Hmm?

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:16.434 position:33% line:89% align:start
That voice.

01:15:16.467 --> 01:15:19.534 position:19% line:83% align:start
As I thought, it's not
one of the five survivors.

01:15:19.567 --> 01:15:21.000 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Huh?

01:15:26.434 --> 01:15:28.267 position:21% line:89% align:start
How truly upsetting.

01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:32.033 position:10% line:83% align:start
An additional survivor has
rendered my prophesy incorrect.

01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:34.767 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Hey!

01:15:34.801 --> 01:15:37.067 position:21% line:89% align:start
Is your name Eneru?

01:15:41.067 --> 01:15:44.167 position:41% line:89% align:start
Luffy!

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:46.267 position:10% line:89% align:start
What did you do to my crew?

01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:48.667 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're gonna regret it.

01:15:48.701 --> 01:15:53.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're addressing a God,
so show some respect.

01:15:53.133 --> 01:15:55.100 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
What's so special about you?

01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:01.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
'Cause from where I'm standin',
you're just a jerk!

01:16:01.167 --> 01:16:03.067 position:19% line:89% align:start
You'll find out soon.

01:16:09.567 --> 01:16:11.033 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's your power?

01:16:11.067 --> 01:16:12.634 position:19% line:89% align:start
This won't take long.

01:16:13.634 --> 01:16:14.534 position:41% line:89% align:start
Luffy!

01:16:14.567 --> 01:16:16.534 position:38% line:89% align:start

01:16:42.334 --> 01:16:44.033 position:41% line:89% align:start
Is he?

01:16:51.601 --> 01:16:54.667 position:27% line:83% align:start
You dodged that
one fairly well.

01:16:54.701 --> 01:16:57.367 position:13% line:89% align:start
60 Million Volt Julungul!

01:17:01.067 --> 01:17:02.601 position:35% line:89% align:start
Luffy, no!

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:05.701 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Huh?

01:17:07.367 --> 01:17:10.367 position:19% line:89% align:start
100 Million Volt Vari!

01:17:19.167 --> 01:17:20.701 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Lightning's not hurting him.

01:17:20.734 --> 01:17:22.334 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is that because...

01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:24.667 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Back off!

01:17:26.267 --> 01:17:28.067 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI
...he's rubber?

01:17:30.501 --> 01:17:34.534 position:30% line:89% align:start
[shocked yell]

01:17:42.567 --> 01:17:45.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
[NAMI] If that's true,
then it looks like Luffy

01:17:45.167 --> 01:17:49.033 position:10% line:83% align:start
is the only one in the world
who's a match for this guy!

01:17:49.067 --> 01:17:50.701 position:27% line:89% align:start
Thank goodness!

01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:57.434 position:10% line:89% align:start
There's no way you're human.

01:17:57.467 --> 01:17:58.567 position:38% line:89% align:start
Are you?

01:17:58.601 --> 01:18:00.300 position:27% line:89% align:start
My name's Luffy.

01:18:00.334 --> 01:18:02.701 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm a pirate made of rubber!

01:18:03.434 --> 01:18:04.367 position:38% line:89% align:start
Rubber?

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:07.067 position:5% line:89% align:start
So your lightning can't hurt me!

01:18:08.334 --> 01:18:10.334 position:38% line:89% align:start

01:18:10.367 --> 01:18:12.100 position:38% line:89% align:start

Nice try, pal.

01:18:14.501 --> 01:18:19.133 position:27% line:89% align:start
Gum-Gum Gatling!

01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:23.033 position:41% line:89% align:start
Luffy!

01:18:23.067 --> 01:18:25.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
[ENERU] It's unfortunate
that lightning doesn't work,

01:18:25.267 --> 01:18:27.100 position:7% line:89% align:start
but I can adjust accordingly.

01:18:29.734 --> 01:18:33.234 position:30% line:83% align:start
How about Max
200 Million Volt Vari?

01:18:40.167 --> 01:18:41.701 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't tell me.

01:19:00.834 --> 01:19:02.334 position:30% line:83% align:start
I have little
interest in playing around

01:19:02.367 --> 01:19:04.200 position:19% line:89% align:start
with the likes of you.

01:19:04.234 --> 01:19:06.200 position:19% line:89% align:start
For I am a mighty God!

01:19:06.234 --> 01:19:09.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
And I will create
the new world as I see fit!

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:12.334 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

Whoa, what is that?

01:19:30.601 --> 01:19:35.100 position:30% line:89% align:start
[ENERU laughs]

01:19:35.133 --> 01:19:36.767 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's a thundercloud.

01:19:42.634 --> 01:19:45.067 position:10% line:83% align:start

to leave, immediately!

Eneru, he's planning
to obliterate this island!

01:19:51.067 --> 01:19:51.634 position:38% line:89% align:start
No way!

01:19:51.667 --> 01:19:52.667 position:30% line:89% align:start
That can't be!

01:19:52.701 --> 01:19:54.167 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't be absurd!

01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:56.701 position:35% line:83% align:start
[GAN FALL]
No, she's right!

01:19:56.734 --> 01:19:59.033 position:13% line:89% align:start
We're all in grave danger.

01:19:59.067 --> 01:19:59.701 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hurry!

01:19:59.734 --> 01:20:01.701 position:10% line:89% align:start
Leave, while you still can!

[ROBIN]
Such dark clouds.

What in the world
is that man up to?

01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:14.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
Luffy and Miss Navigator,
be careful.

01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:26.200 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
That can't be good.

So you'd rather die, then?

That's right.

01:22:59.367 --> 01:23:00.734 position:21% line:89% align:start
The day he set sail.

01:23:00.767 --> 01:23:02.334 position:7% line:89% align:start

[OLD CHIEF]
Yes.

01:23:08.534 --> 01:23:12.567 position:5% line:83% align:start

[OLD KING]
It's settled.

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:19.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
Mariejois will let us
enter the Grand Line.

01:23:19.167 --> 01:23:22.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
As such, I must send
you on another mission.

01:23:22.367 --> 01:23:24.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
Right. I'd be honored.

01:23:24.267 --> 01:23:27.334 position:5% line:83% align:start
[OLD KING] That said, not only
have I decided that my soldiers

01:23:27.367 --> 01:23:29.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
will accompany you
on this assignment,

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.200 position:30% line:83% align:start
but I will be
joining you as well.

01:23:31.234 --> 01:23:32.067 position:33% line:89% align:start
Understood?

01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:33.434 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes, sir!

Hey, how's it going, Nola,

01:23:44.934 --> 01:23:47.300 position:10% line:83% align:start
you've really made yourself
comfortable in these old ruins,

01:23:47.334 --> 01:23:49.400 position:10% line:89% align:start
haven't you, little friend?

01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:51.601 position:16% line:89% align:start
So, when do you suppose

01:23:51.634 --> 01:23:54.067 position:33% line:83% align:start
Noland and
the others'll come and visit?

01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:55.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's the only thing
you ever ask me

01:23:55.734 --> 01:23:58.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
about when you come
to ring the bell.

01:23:58.067 --> 01:24:00.601 position:27% line:83% align:start
It won't be easy
for him to return.

01:24:00.634 --> 01:24:02.467 position:30% line:83% align:start
He was born in
the far northern seas,

01:24:02.501 --> 01:24:05.601 position:30% line:83% align:start
you know, and
he does have a family.

But he swore.

01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:10.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
As long as we keep
on ringing this bell,

01:24:10.667 --> 01:24:13.300 position:7% line:83% align:start
one day, he'll hear the sound
and follow it back to our--

Duoooo!

That looks like danger.

01:24:19.734 --> 01:24:21.033 position:30% line:89% align:start

would be gold here,

Course not.

01:28:11.167 --> 01:28:12.667 position:10% line:89% align:start
Please wait a little longer,

01:28:12.701 --> 01:28:15.601 position:13% line:83% align:start
and I'll be here to convey
that message to you.

01:28:15.634 --> 01:28:17.200 position:21% line:89% align:start
"We are right here!"

01:28:17.234 --> 01:28:19.267 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NOLAND]
Are you still alive?

01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:21.667 position:13% line:83% align:start
[CALGARA] There's a great
deal I need to tell you!

01:28:23.067 --> 01:28:24.767 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NOLAND]
Calgara.

01:28:24.801 --> 01:28:28.767 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm just worried
about your safety.

01:28:28.801 --> 01:28:30.467 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CALGARA]
No matter what, Noland,

01:28:30.501 --> 01:28:34.067 position:27% line:83% align:start
we must promise
that we'll meet again!

01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:38.334 position:30% line:83% align:start
Bring back the
Light of Shandora!

01:28:39.434 --> 01:28:41.467 position:19% line:89% align:start
The Light of Shandora.

01:28:41.501 --> 01:28:43.501 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's up to me!

01:28:43.534 --> 01:28:45.734 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Robin!

01:28:45.767 --> 01:28:47.167 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ROBIN]
Luffy?

01:28:53.434 --> 01:28:55.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
[ROBIN] What's that
gold thing you've got?

01:28:55.367 --> 01:28:56.200 position:33% line:89% align:start
You'll see!

01:28:56.234 --> 01:28:57.167 position:13% line:89% align:start
That old bell is supposed

01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:59.667 position:16% line:83% align:start
to be waitin' at the top
of this vine, right?

01:28:59.701 --> 01:29:00.734 position:38% line:83% align:start
[WYPER]
What?

01:29:00.767 --> 01:29:03.601 position:21% line:83% align:start
And that Eneru guy
is tryin' to get to it first?

01:29:03.634 --> 01:29:06.434 position:38% line:89% align:start
Exactly!

01:29:06.467 --> 01:29:08.033 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Gotcha!

01:29:10.434 --> 01:29:11.501 position:41% line:89% align:start
Wait.

01:29:11.534 --> 01:29:13.701 position:7% line:83% align:start
So you're telling me the bell
is up there somewhere?

01:29:13.734 --> 01:29:15.567 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're after it, too?

01:29:15.601 --> 01:29:17.701 position:5% line:89% align:start
If it's real, it must be there.

01:29:17.734 --> 01:29:20.434 position:30% line:83% align:start
However, Eneru
is hot on its trail.

01:29:23.601 --> 01:29:26.400 position:24% line:83% align:start
I need my Shooter
and my bazooka!

01:29:26.434 --> 01:29:27.267 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, dear.

01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:29.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
They were smashed up,
so I left them.

01:29:29.601 --> 01:29:30.701 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

01:29:30.734 --> 01:29:32.367 position:35% line:89% align:start
You what?

01:29:33.634 --> 01:29:34.501 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's right.

01:29:34.534 --> 01:29:35.801 position:16% line:89% align:start
When we transported you,

01:29:35.834 --> 01:29:38.234 position:5% line:89% align:start
I noticed that you were injured.

01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:42.767 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Thunder Ball!

01:29:42.801 --> 01:29:44.434 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

01:29:44.467 --> 01:29:47.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
You really are good for a
laugh, I'll give you that.

01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:49.200 position:38% line:89% align:start
[pants]

01:29:49.234 --> 01:29:50.767 position:27% line:89% align:start
Okay, it worked.

01:29:50.801 --> 01:29:52.000 position:35% line:89% align:start
But still.

01:29:52.033 --> 01:29:54.100 position:5% line:83% align:start
That little defensive technique
won't do you very much good

01:29:54.133 --> 01:29:56.300 position:7% line:89% align:start
after I crank up the voltage.

01:29:56.334 --> 01:29:58.334 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm far too busy for this.

01:29:58.367 --> 01:29:59.701 position:38% line:89% align:start
Begone.

01:30:00.534 --> 01:30:02.167 position:19% line:89% align:start
Here, Special Attack.

01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:03.767 position:27% line:89% align:start
Exploding Star!

01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:11.701 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-oh.

01:30:11.734 --> 01:30:13.334 position:24% line:89% align:start
Can I start over?

01:30:13.367 --> 01:30:14.434 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Usopp!

01:30:14.467 --> 01:30:16.167 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ENERU]
Oh, you again.

01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:20.067 position:27% line:89% align:start
Care to join us?

01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:20.634 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
You made it!

01:30:20.667 --> 01:30:21.434 position:41% line:89% align:start
Nami!

01:30:21.467 --> 01:30:23.133 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
What's up?

01:30:23.167 --> 01:30:24.234 position:27% line:89% align:start
Save me, please.

01:30:24.267 --> 01:30:25.467 position:38% line:89% align:start
Really?

01:30:25.501 --> 01:30:26.400 position:38% line:89% align:start
A Waver!

01:30:26.434 --> 01:30:27.400 position:27% line:89% align:start
We'll jump off!

01:30:27.434 --> 01:30:28.300 position:24% line:89% align:start
From this height?

01:30:28.334 --> 01:30:29.300 position:30% line:89% align:start
You're crazy!

01:30:29.334 --> 01:30:31.467 position:19% line:83% align:start
We'll just try to land
on the Island Clouds!

01:30:31.501 --> 01:30:33.501 position:33% line:89% align:start
Sounds good!

01:30:43.834 --> 01:30:45.634 position:21% line:89% align:start
Here, take my hand!

01:30:48.567 --> 01:30:50.300 position:33% line:89% align:start
Let him go!

01:30:55.767 --> 01:30:57.634 position:35% line:89% align:start
Now, jump.

01:30:57.667 --> 01:30:59.267 position:33% line:89% align:start
But, Sanji!

01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:03.467 position:33% line:89% align:start
El... Thor!

01:31:07.701 --> 01:31:09.434 position:21% line:89% align:start
So they jumped off.

01:31:09.467 --> 01:31:12.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
But they haven't
escaped me in the slightest.

01:31:12.267 --> 01:31:13.067 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
Hey.

01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:14.467 position:38% line:89% align:start
God guy.

01:31:14.501 --> 01:31:15.534 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ENERU]
Hmm?

01:31:15.567 --> 01:31:18.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SANJI] There's something
I wanted to say to you.

01:31:18.467 --> 01:31:20.234 position:27% line:89% align:start
But before I do,

01:31:20.267 --> 01:31:22.567 position:10% line:89% align:start
let me express my gratitude.

01:31:27.634 --> 01:31:29.534 position:30% line:89% align:start
For the light.

01:31:29.567 --> 01:31:31.234 position:30% line:89% align:start
That was nice.

01:31:31.267 --> 01:31:33.300 position:38% line:89% align:start
Thanks.

01:31:33.334 --> 01:31:34.467 position:35% line:89% align:start
Okay then.

01:31:34.501 --> 01:31:35.801 position:35% line:89% align:start
What else?

01:31:35.834 --> 01:31:41.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SANJI] Oh. I was
gonna say, "Drop dead."

01:31:46.834 --> 01:31:48.200 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're kidding.

01:31:49.133 --> 01:31:51.033 position:30% line:89% align:start
What happened?

01:31:51.067 --> 01:31:53.267 position:30% line:83% align:start
What were you
doing inside the ship?

01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:00.701 position:10% line:89% align:start
Damn you Blue Sea dwellers!

01:32:09.767 --> 01:32:10.434 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
Okay.

01:32:10.467 --> 01:32:13.167 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nami fell on some Island Clouds.

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:16.100 position:30% line:89% align:start
Usopp Hopping!

01:32:23.801 --> 01:32:26.467 position:21% line:89% align:start
Long-nose, it's you!

01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:29.334 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
Yup.

01:32:29.367 --> 01:32:31.067 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Found you!

01:32:31.567 --> 01:32:32.734 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ROBIN]
You're all right!

01:32:42.267 --> 01:32:44.100 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Luffy really went up there?

01:32:44.133 --> 01:32:45.200 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ROBIN]
Yes.

01:32:45.234 --> 01:32:46.434 position:35% line:89% align:start
Okay then.

01:32:46.467 --> 01:32:49.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll go chase after
him on the Waver!

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:52.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
We have to get off of
this island and quickly!

01:32:59.300 --> 01:33:02.534 position:13% line:83% align:start
It'll take more than that
to bring this ship down.

01:33:32.567 --> 01:33:33.634 position:35% line:89% align:start
Now, then.

01:33:33.667 --> 01:33:37.100 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm right above Giant Jack.

01:33:37.133 --> 01:33:39.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
I highly doubt that
anyone would ever come

01:33:39.167 --> 01:33:40.667 position:33% line:83% align:start
looking for
something in the skies

01:33:40.701 --> 01:33:43.534 position:10% line:89% align:start
above the temple, after all.

01:33:44.567 --> 01:33:46.234 position:21% line:89% align:start
Where is that bell?

01:33:46.267 --> 01:33:48.334 position:21% line:89% align:start
It has to be nearby.

01:33:52.501 --> 01:33:55.334 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

01:34:04.334 --> 01:34:06.067 position:35% line:89% align:start
Brilliant!

01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:08.367 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's the great bell tower,

01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:12.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
pride of the legendary
City of Gold, Shandora!

01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:14.701 position:7% line:89% align:start
My, what an incredible sight!

01:34:14.734 --> 01:34:17.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll take this with me
and make my glorious ascent

01:34:17.734 --> 01:34:20.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
to the Endless Vearth
at long last!

01:34:31.267 --> 01:34:32.601 position:41% line:89% align:start
Whew.

01:34:32.634 --> 01:34:33.334 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:34:33.367 --> 01:34:34.501 position:41% line:89% align:start
Luffy!

01:34:34.534 --> 01:34:36.100 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Hey, Nami!

01:34:36.133 --> 01:34:38.601 position:24% line:83% align:start
I didn't know you
were up here, too!

01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:57.667 position:7% line:89% align:start
Great, it's bigger this time!

01:34:57.701 --> 01:34:59.467 position:21% line:89% align:start
Man, that guy sucks!

01:34:59.501 --> 01:35:01.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
Luffy, we need to go!

01:35:01.267 --> 01:35:03.067 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hop on the Waver!

01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:04.200 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
I can't.

01:35:04.234 --> 01:35:05.701 position:10% line:89% align:start
What do you mean, you can't?

01:35:05.734 --> 01:35:08.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
I may not have to
rescue you anymore,

01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:10.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I've still got
unfinished business here!

01:35:10.834 --> 01:35:12.534 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just quit it already!

01:35:12.567 --> 01:35:13.167 position:30% line:89% align:start
If we don't--

01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:14.767 position:13% line:89% align:start
You saw it yourself, Nami!

01:35:14.801 --> 01:35:16.267 position:33% line:89% align:start
I saw what?

01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:19.601 position:24% line:83% align:start
The City of Gold,
it actually exists!

01:35:20.067 --> 01:35:23.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
He's ringing the bell?

01:35:23.267 --> 01:35:24.434 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's right.

01:35:24.467 --> 01:35:25.701 position:5% line:89% align:start
But the Shandorians are the ones

01:35:25.734 --> 01:35:27.601 position:5% line:89% align:start
who inherited Calgara's wishes,

01:35:27.634 --> 01:35:29.234 position:13% line:89% align:start
so it has to be one of us!

01:35:29.267 --> 01:35:32.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
What does any of this have
to do with Straw Hat?

01:35:32.367 --> 01:35:35.734 position:30% line:83% align:start
The old story
says that 400 years ago,

01:35:35.767 --> 01:35:39.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
an explorer lied about
a city made of gold.

01:35:39.367 --> 01:35:41.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
Although most people
simply laughed at him,

01:35:41.734 --> 01:35:44.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
his descendants believed
his words and have continued

01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:47.601 position:10% line:83% align:start
to search for that legendary
place to this very day.

01:35:47.634 --> 01:35:49.300 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

01:35:49.334 --> 01:35:51.501 position:19% line:89% align:start
Luffy believes it too.

01:35:51.534 --> 01:35:53.267 position:16% line:89% align:start
It wasn't just a story!

01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:56.067 position:30% line:83% align:start
Noland wasn't
telling lies at all!

01:35:56.100 --> 01:35:57.400 position:5% line:89% align:start
I have to make sure the old man

01:35:57.434 --> 01:36:00.501 position:30% line:83% align:start

It's a big bell.

I'm sure you can
hear it from anywhere.

What are you going to think

01:39:59.701 --> 01:40:01.300 position:16% line:89% align:start
when you return to Jaya

01:40:01.334 --> 01:40:04.133 position:24% line:83% align:start
only to discover
that we've disappeared?

Please wait a little longer,

01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:08.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
and I'll be able to convey
that message to you.

Jaya Island in the Grand Line.

I swear to all

[CRICKET] People may not
have believed Noland,

but no one has ever
disproved the existence

of the City of Gold
or the Sky Island.

That's what legends are, right?

01:40:49.767 --> 01:40:54.033 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ring the bell!

Mont Blanc Noland.

Hey, mister!

And your monkey friends!

The City of Gold is real!

Now that's a legend.

01:41:27.701 --> 01:41:30.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
I knew that old Noland
wasn't a liar.

01:41:30.701 --> 01:41:35.267 position:10% line:83% align:start
You rang that big bell just
for me, didn't you, kid?

01:41:37.334 --> 01:41:38.501 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
I knew it.

01:41:38.534 --> 01:41:43.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
The City of Gold
existed all along!

[NARRATOR]
The triumphant chiming

of the "Light of Shandora"

01:41:50.667 --> 01:41:53.200 position:19% line:83% align:start
testified to the glory
of the vanished city

01:41:53.234 --> 01:41:54.667 position:13% line:89% align:start
it was built to represent,

01:41:54.701 --> 01:41:57.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
and it cheerfully declared
the end of the fighting

01:41:57.501 --> 01:41:58.601 position:24% line:89% align:start
with a love song.

After 400 years of silence,

01:42:03.133 --> 01:42:06.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
the golden bell's message
resonated strong and true.

01:42:06.767 --> 01:42:09.234 position:21% line:89% align:start
"We are right here."

01:42:13.267 --> 01:42:14.434 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
It rang.

01:42:19.601 --> 01:42:24.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
I have to wonder,
though, did they hear it?

[NAMI]
Yeah.
