1
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,153
[Vega] All said and done,

2
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:21,655
it's gonna come
down to a handful

3
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:24,725
of decisions we
make out here...

4
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,326
[Nicky] Well, who
we are has always

5
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:28,228
been defined by what we do.

6
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:31,031
How is this different
from any other time?

7
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:48,414
[Vega] Out here, our choices
affect not only our lives,

8
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:52,085
but the lives of all the people
we've sworn to protect.

9
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,054
We can only hope...

10
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,057
... we make the right ones.

11
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,883
[Mason] Breaking into
"Mission A," altitude, 8,000.

12
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,118
Atmospheric pressure,
zero‐point‐eight.

13
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,189
[Toni] That's our cue, Marines.
Gear up. Prep for drop.

14
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:51,512
[scattered breaths]

15
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,160
Ah‐‐oh, yeah!

16
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,295
Lookin' good in
that armor, Kamille!

17
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,332
You know nothin' gets me hot
like seein' you go commando.

18
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,700
Seriously...?

19
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,302
Careful, Essex‐‐you're gonna
make your hand jealous.

20
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,370
[Essex] Heh.

21
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,240
No worries, babe.
She's your second biggest fan.

22
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,875
And she knows how to party.

23
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,644
Heh...

24
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,378
[Essex cries out in pain]

25
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,347
[Milque] And‐‐strike fifty.

26
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,849
Well, whatever else
happens today,

27
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:32,385
at least we can't get shot down
any worse than that, am I right?

28
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,720
Yo, Nicky.

29
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,789
You okay, kid?

30
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:39,860
Yeah, he's fine. He's just ready
for some action. Aren't ya?

31
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,428
You seen any sign of that
tactical package yet?

32
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:48,268
Still waiting on it. Our omnis
are synched and linked...

33
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:51,204
... but there's nothing in the
way of mission specs so far.

34
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,372
Makes me uneasy.

35
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:55,208
Does Command usually wait
for the last possible minute

36
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:59,746
to tell us who the enemy
is, sir? Seems weird.

37
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,447
Ya gotta be ready for anything.

38
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:05,552
Like Commander Shephard always
said, nothing is ever simple.

39
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,454
Damn, Vega, sucks for you
that Shepard's dead...

40
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:12,458
You two would have made
a really cute couple.

41
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,527
[Essex makes kissing noises]

42
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,530
[Milque and Kamille laugh]

43
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,932
You think I'm ashamed
to show respect

44
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,267
for someone who saved
billions of lives?

45
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:22,903
I'm proud to follow
that example.

46
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,638
Laugh it up all
you want, pretty boy.

47
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,372
I know who my heroes are.

48
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,709
Okay, someone's a
little defensive...

49
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,476
Whatever, man. You want
a hero to worship,

50
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:31,978
I'm right here, baby.

51
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,647
[Toni] That so?

52
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:36,583
[Vega] Attention!

53
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,319
Let's get this straight.

54
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,287
What I see here is a squad

55
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,356
of highly trained
special forces.

56
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:46,326
But you're not
warriors. Not yet.

57
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,762
Today we find out what
you're made of, Marines.

58
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,997
It's time to earn that uniform.

59
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:54,768
Our final Mission specs
are in from Command.

60
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:58,238
I'm syncing to your omnis now.
Take a good look.

61
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:03,476
[Toni] Let that sink in... This
is what you're up against...

62
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:06,847
Think tough. Think built
like a brick shithouse.

63
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,682
That's right, virgins.

64
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:11,051
Your first dance goes to
the Krogan Blood Pack,

65
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:14,420
the meanest bunch of reptilian
uglies in the Terminus.

66
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:16,990
Krogan are like walking tanks;

67
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,293
they've got thick, armored skin,
two sets of vital organs‐‐

68
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:23,363
Relax, Nicky;
just aim for the head.

69
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,798
[Toni] The bastards are
currently laying siege

70
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:28,068
to our colony on Fehl Prime...

71
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,069
It so happens to be

72
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,905
one of our top pharma
processing facilities...

73
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,306
Meds we pull outta this rock

74
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:36,376
cure our sick kiddies
across the galaxy.

75
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,911
Lot of civilians down there...

76
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:41,347
Sitrep shows the Blood Pack
just outside the perimeter,

77
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:43,016
hammering the colony K‐barriers.

78
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:46,887
They get in, we'll be scraping
up colonists for a week...

79
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,623
So‐‐we hit 'em fast,
we hit 'em hard;

80
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,457
shuttles strafe their lines.

81
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,661
Then we insert ourselves between
the enemy and their objective,

82
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:58,031
and vigorously
negotiate their defeat.

83
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,535
It won't be easy; things are
getting messy down there.

84
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:03,804
But that's why
they called us...

85
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,972
We're Alliance Marines, people!

86
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,610
This is what we do!
Any questions?

87
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,915
Then who's ready to go
kick some krogan ass?!

88
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:18,752
Sir! Alliance Marines
are, sir! Hoo‐rah!

89
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:49,883
[Brood sneers, laughs]

90
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,518
[Treeya] Christine,
what should we do?

91
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,454
The Alliance Marines
are coming! Just hold on!

92
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:00,060
[Brood growls, grunts]

93
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,935
[guards scream]

94
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,874
[Guard A] The Barrier's down!

95
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:17,711
[Christine shudders]

96
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,079
[Christine gasps]

97
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,080
[Christine cries]

98
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,748
[Treeya] Christine!

99
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:24,084
[Christine] I'm okay.

100
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:25,819
‐‐Dammit!
‐‐You're not a soldier.

101
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,487
Stop taking chances.

102
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:30,991
No, we've got to hold them
off... Just a little longer!

103
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,898
Brood! Well done; you have
earned your place as my second.

104
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:38,732
Sir.

105
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,201
[Archuk] Now,
unleash the vorcha.

106
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:44,070
[Brood laughs]

107
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,439
[various growls and snarls]

108
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,475
[varren roars]

109
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,745
[scattered gasps]

110
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,780
[Guard B] They're animals...

111
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:13,700
‐‐[Guard C cries out]
‐‐[Guard D] Shit!

112
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,735
[Guard E cries out]

113
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:17,103
[Brood chuckles]

114
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:32,185
[Brood] An... air strike...?

115
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,621
No!!

116
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,193
[krogan grunts]

117
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,264
[Guard F] Alliance drop
ships! We're saved!

118
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:45,799
[guards cheer]

119
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,634
[Christine sighs] They made it.

120
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,570
[Treeya] And not a
moment too soon.

121
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,785
[Mason] Get off our lawn,
ya dirty space turtles!

122
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,052
[Toni] Put us down, Mason.

123
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:11,892
Roger that, Cap. Now prepping
for quick dump. Fifteen seconds.

124
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,665
[Toni] On your feet, Marines!

125
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:22,235
"A" Squad, aft hatch!
"B" squad, fore hatch!

126
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,175
[Mason] Dust off in 5... 4...

127
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,877
Shit!

128
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,150
[Gamma Pilot] Abort! Abort!
Alpha and Beta are down!

129
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,220
Repeat: Alpha and Beta are down!

130
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:44,257
[Mason] Roger, Gamma‐‐abort
confirmed. Evasive maneuvers!

131
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,261
Dammit.

132
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,233
[Mason] Breaking off
to re‐engage!

133
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,868
[Brood growls]

134
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,270
[scattered yells]

135
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,774
[Vega pants]

136
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:10,751
Goin' down...! Brace for impact!

137
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:29,703
Now! Send the humans
to their gods!

138
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,872
[varren roars]

139
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:35,275
[scattered grunts]

140
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:39,846
[Marine Z pants, grunts]

141
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:45,085
[Marine Z screams, cries out]

142
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:51,257
[Treeya] What's
happening out there?

143
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,859
[Christine gasps]

144
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,360
[Treeya exhales]

145
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:04,104
[Vega grunts]

146
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,040
[Vega groans]

147
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,011
[scattered groans and grunts]

148
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:14,114
[Milque coughs]

149
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,149
[Milque] Our pilot
is so fired...

150
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,718
[Mason coughs]

151
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:21,655
Yeah? Well, I got one
better for ya... I quit.

152
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:24,290
[Toni] Move Marines!
Evac this bucket!

153
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,326
[Toni grunts]

154
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,028
Whoa, Captain, that looks bad...

155
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:30,263
I said move! That's an order!

156
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:31,297
[Toni grunts]

157
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,667
[Essex] You heard him! On me!

158
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,335
[scattered grunts]

159
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,337
You too, Vega!

160
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:38,438
Better bite down, sir.

161
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:42,843
[Toni makes muffled grunts]

162
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:44,711
[Vega] On three...

163
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:47,781
[Toni screams]

164
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,082

00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,054
[Vega yells]

167
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,357
[Brood] Go!
Search for survivors!

168
00:10:57,357 --> 00:11:02,428
[Vega grunts]

169

[Vega pants]

170
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,343
Move!

171
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,118
[Essex yells]

172
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,456
[Milque] Come on, Vega!
You can make it!

173
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:34,394
[Mason cries out]

174
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:36,029
[Nicky] Sir!

175
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,404
Incoming!!

176
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,307
[Kamille] Can anyone see them?!

177
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:48,241
‐‐[Mason] We are so screwed!
‐‐[Kamille] How many are there?!

178
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,209
[Essex] We can't hold
them off for long!

179
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,912
[Nicky] What do we do?
Sir! What do we do?!

180
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:05,091
[Vega] Hold your fire!
Cease fire! Essex! Kamille!

181
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,427
[Kamille]
What the hell, Vega?!

182
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:09,530
You guys are just burnin'
Thermal Clips at this range.

183
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,531
Save it for when it counts.

184
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:11,532
[Mason moans]

185
00:12:11,532 --> 00:12:13,499
You gonna live there, flyboy?

186
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,436
I told you... I quit that job...

187
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,304
[Vega] That's a "yes."
On your feet.

188
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,940
[Mason grunts]

189
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:26,412
[Archuk] Hold your fire!

190
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,181
[scattered groans]

191
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:35,255
Alliance! Show yourselves and be
granted an honorable execution!

192
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,257
Wow... Some negotiator.

193
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,193
Milque, I need you to give
Nicky your power cells.

194
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:43,196
See what you can do about
upgrading my K‐barriers.

195
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:45,098
Okay... That's great for you,

196
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,300
but now what am I supposed
to use for shields?

197
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,804
Shields? You still got a big
rock to hide behind, don'tcha?

198
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:52,472
Flyboy, look after the captain.

199
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,508
Right. Already on it, boss.

200
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:56,109
Listen... You've
got to get up top

201
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,011
and keep their snipers off me.

202
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,947
Nicky, you'll radio me tactical?

203
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,116
That's a big affirmative, sir.

204
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,218
And what the hell
are you gonna do?

205
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,553
A krogan never
turns down a chance

206
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:08,488
for glory on the battlefield.

207
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:11,157
So I'm gonna go out there
and give them what they want,

208
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,859
which should buy the
two of you enough time

209
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:14,561
to move around and flank them.

210
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:16,930
[Kamille and Essex exhale]

211
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,499
[Essex] Hold on... I'm not
running into that firing squad!

212
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,602
No... we circle all the
way around their line

213
00:13:21,602 --> 00:13:23,904
and come in behind them...

214
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,506
It's crazy, but it could work.

215
00:13:25,506 --> 00:13:29,142
We're gonna have to
make it work, or we all die...

216
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,012
That is, unless you got
a better plan, Essex?

217
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:34,314
Hey, why're you askin' me?
You're squad leader,

218
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,183
at least for another
two minutes, anyway...

219

[Vega pants, grunts]

224
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,906
Nicky! Where's my tactical?

225
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,179
It's coming in now, sir.

226
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,247
They're clustered at your 12,

227
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,315
forty meters and
holding position.

228
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:12,553
I show one sniper
already zeroed in on you.

229
00:14:12,553 --> 00:14:14,420
[Milque] Roger that. I got 'em.

230
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,924
[Vega] Not yet. Hold your fire
till Essex and Kamille engage.

231
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:21,461
Wait.

232
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,196
[Sniper grunts]

233
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:27,300

one has accepted my offer.

[Vega grunts]

235
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,242

Flanking team, where the
hell are you? Talk to me!

244
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:03,670
[Kamille] Almost there.
One hundred meters.

00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,487
[Essex groans]

328
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,824
Sorry! Hot damn...

329
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,860
[Brood grunts]

330
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,328
[Essex chuckles] Hello...

331
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,864
Get on with it!

332
00:19:23,864 --> 00:19:25,632
[Essex] Gladly.

333
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,500
[Vega] Essex!

334
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,370
Stand down, Marine!
We are not murderers!

335
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,505
This is war, man!

336
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:33,339
‐‐Yes!
‐‐[Brood groans]

337
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,241
You're right! This is war!

338
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:38,278
And now, this krogan
is a prisoner of war.

339
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,550
You two gonna kiss or what?

340
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,418
Nicely done, squad leader.

341
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:47,821
[Essex grunts]

342
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:50,524
That's the last of 'em;
we did it, sir.

343
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:53,226
That was insane, goin' out
there as bait, y'know...

344
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:55,395
I thought for sure you were
gonna get us all killed...

345
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:59,232
But hey... I guess I gotta
be wrong sometime, right?

346
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:00,634
[Kamille] I think
what he means is...

347
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:03,369
We owe you one... Big time.

348
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,507
It's "Vega," yeah?
Tell you what...

349
00:20:06,507 --> 00:20:09,876
Vega here deserves
a goddamn medal.

350
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,244
Not to brag, but technically,

351
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:13,479
I took out more of
'em than he did.

352
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:16,517
"Technically," you almost
took me out, too!

353
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:18,919
You're still in the dog house.

354
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:20,921
[Vega] It was a
team effort, guys.

355
00:20:20,921 --> 00:20:24,490
Look, will you drop it already?
I said I was sorry.

356
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,427
[laughter]

357
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:30,030
Vega... Hell of a
battle there, son;

358
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,498
that's the kind of leadership
I'd expect from a veteran.

359
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:33,700
It was the training, sir.

360
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,401
Don't sell us that crap!

361
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:38,271
I never taught you that kind
of soldiering and you know it.

362
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:42,609
Quit playin' coy and accept
the compliment; you earned it.

363
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:45,812
Your courage under fire saved
a lot of good people, Vega.

364
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:47,347
And it's for their
continued safety

365
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:49,683
we'd like you and your
squad to stick around...

366
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:51,518
Hold down the fort.

367
00:20:51,518 --> 00:20:53,987
Admiral, the Blood Pack
is finished here...

368
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:57,323
All due respect, but we're
a special forces unit.

369
00:20:57,323 --> 00:21:00,794
Can't you just assign a
standard security detail?

370
00:21:00,794 --> 00:21:02,863
I'm giving you
an order, soldier.

371
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:05,365
The Fehl Prime facility
and all of its inhabitants

372
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:07,901
are a very valuable
resource for the Alliance.

373
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:10,871
It is far too important
for us to leave undefended.

374
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:11,972
Are we clear?

375
00:21:11,972 --> 00:21:14,007
Yes, sir, we're clear.

376
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:17,043
[Hackett] I see from your badge
you remember the Normandy.

377
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:19,980
I try to, sir; I think
everyone should.

378
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,716
It's good to have heroes,
Vega, but don't be too eager

379
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:24,951
to follow in
Shepard's footsteps.

380
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,554
That kind of greatness only
comes at a great cost...

381
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:29,623
Remember that. Hackett out.

382
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:34,695
[Toni] Well, Lieutenant...

383
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:37,531
Welcome to the
Terminus Systems...

384
00:21:59,853 --> 00:22:00,854
[Messner] All right,
it's all yours...

385
00:22:00,854 --> 00:22:03,023
Let's get this baby unloaded!

386
00:22:03,023 --> 00:22:04,658
[dock tech] We're clear!

387
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:13,433
[Kamille] Three meters...
Two... One...

388
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:17,638
And we're docked...
Hold it there, Vega.

389
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:19,740
[Vega] Copy that,
Kamille. Standing by.

390
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,874
[Mason] Explain something to me.

391
00:22:20,874 --> 00:22:24,077
First the cannon, now full‐on
military‐grade barriers?

392
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:27,413
Seem like overkill
to anybody else?

393
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:30,617
I mean... we haven't seen a
hostile in, what, two years?

394
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:33,086
And they got us tricked out
to take on a whole fleet.

395
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:35,455
[Nicky] You're clear to
retract the cables, sir.

396
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:36,690
[Vega] Nicky.
We've been over this.

397
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,725
You don't have to
keep calling me sir.

398
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:39,926
[Milque] Heh. Kiss ass.

399
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:41,828
Would you just do your job?

400
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:43,096
[Milque] Callin' 'em
like I see 'em.

401
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:44,898
Don't hate the messenger.

402
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:45,899
[Essex sighs]

403
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:47,100
Just wastin' their time...

404
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,637
My gun already packs all the
firepower this place needs.

405
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:52,806
Oh, please, I've seen
your "gun," Essex...

406
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:55,742
Hate to be the one to break it
to you, but... not that big.

407
00:22:55,742 --> 00:22:57,911
I'm guessin' we've all heard
the rumors at this point.

408
00:22:57,911 --> 00:22:59,112
Ah‐‐! What?!

409
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:01,515
[Nicky] He means the ones
about entire colony populations

410
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:03,149
disappearing without a trace.

411
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:05,586
Yeah, I've tried askin'
around division about that,

412
00:23:05,586 --> 00:23:06,920
but no one wants to talk.

413
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,557
Official word from
Command is "no comment."

414
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:12,058
Duh, what'd you expect...?

415
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,960
Command doesn't talk
to grunts like us‐‐

416
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,962
you gotta read
between the lines.

417
00:23:15,962 --> 00:23:18,498
"Here, have a big
gun and shut up."

418
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:19,933
That's their comment...

419
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:22,035
Probably all some
Cerberus conspiracy

420
00:23:22,035 --> 00:23:25,071
they're trying to
keep under wraps.

421
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:28,609
[Vega] I dunno‐‐this one doesn't
smell like Cerberus to me.

422
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:29,776
It's not their style.

423
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:31,612
[Tech 1] Yo, Vega!

424
00:23:31,612 --> 00:23:35,148
Last of the Agri‐Dome's Special
Brew... On the house, buddy!

425
00:23:35,148 --> 00:23:37,450
Well, I can never say
no to a free drink!

426
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,586
Then I recommend you
plan on staying drunk,

427
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,522
'cause we still owe you plenty.

428
00:23:41,522 --> 00:23:43,824
Nice work on the new
defenses, by the way.

429
00:23:43,824 --> 00:23:45,859
Ah... It's what we do.

430
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:47,561
Hola, James!

431
00:23:47,561 --> 00:23:49,796
Hey, April! Hola, chispita.

432
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:51,665
‐‐Whatcha doin'?
‐‐Waiting for you!

433
00:23:51,665 --> 00:23:54,067
You ready for duty? Attention!

434
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:56,570
Yes, sir, Lieutenant!

435
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:59,740
Okay, then you'll need this...

436
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,075
Welcome to Delta
Squadron, Private.

437
00:24:02,075 --> 00:24:05,078
April, Vega's working. Sorry.

438
00:24:05,078 --> 00:24:07,548
Nah, it's no problem, Christine.

439
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:12,185
Hey, Treeya. Uh, I mean... Hi.

440
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:13,319
Lieutenant.

441
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,789
[April] Why you always
gotta stare at her like that?

442
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,624
[April grunts]

443
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:20,661
I'm not staring‐‐
and soldiers don't pout.

444
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:24,164
Come here. I need a new lookout.
Whaddaya say, huh?

445
00:24:25,699 --> 00:24:27,668
Only if you teach me
how to shoot that.

446
00:24:27,668 --> 00:24:28,869
[Vega] Well... I don't
think your mom

447
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:30,704
would like that too much...

448
00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:32,639
No, Mommy says
it's a good thing!

449
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:34,174
She says you're gonna
use it to protect us

450
00:24:34,174 --> 00:24:36,109
if the bad guys come back!

451
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:38,512
Is that true? Are you gonna?

452
00:24:38,512 --> 00:24:40,914
She's right; that's
exactly what I'll do.

453
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:44,117
And you can help me by stayin'
on the lookout, Private.

454
00:24:44,117 --> 00:24:47,521
Yes, sir, Lieutenant
James! Hoo‐rah!

455
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:48,454
[April laughs]

456
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:50,724
You sure have a way
with that one, Vega.

457
00:24:50,724 --> 00:24:52,826
I'd swear she was
your little sister.

458
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:55,128
Ew, gross! We're married.

459
00:24:55,128 --> 00:24:57,197
Okay, "Marine," I think
you've pestered Vega

460
00:24:57,197 --> 00:24:58,732
enough for one day.

461
00:24:58,732 --> 00:25:00,601
[Vega] Okay, off you go.

462
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:01,968
There... Thanks, Vega.

463
00:25:01,968 --> 00:25:03,537
'Kay! Over and out, sir.

464
00:25:03,537 --> 00:25:04,605
[Vega] You be good.

465
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:06,740
‐‐[Tech 2] Later days.
‐‐[Tech 1] See you, Vega.

466
00:25:09,142 --> 00:25:10,744
Surely this can't be right...

467
00:25:10,744 --> 00:25:13,814
[Vega sighs]

468
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:15,982
[Mason] You're
killing us, chief.

469
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:18,719
Better make a move
while the gettin's good.

470
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:22,923
Unless you're cool with me
cutting in on your action.

471
00:25:22,923 --> 00:25:25,692
Look, I've already
tried talking to her...

472
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:27,894
She just doesn't seem all
that interested, you know?

473
00:25:27,894 --> 00:25:30,230
If blushing and sighing's
your idea of talk, man,

474
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,599
then we really need to
work on your delivery.

475
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:35,669
[Vega gasps] April's badge!

476
00:25:36,637 --> 00:25:37,838
[Essex] Seriously.
I don't get it.

477
00:25:37,838 --> 00:25:40,741
What's he see in her, anyway?

478
00:25:40,741 --> 00:25:42,809
You kidding me? You
got eyes, don'tcha?

479
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:44,645
Everybody's crazy
for some blue.

480
00:25:44,645 --> 00:25:48,114
[laughter]

481
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:54,688
[Vega] Hm?

482
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:58,959
[Vega sighs]

483
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:04,631
Whoa... Just in the
nick of time, right?

484
00:26:04,631 --> 00:26:07,668
Hey, you're Vega, aren't ya?
Saw ya on the vids...

485
00:26:07,668 --> 00:26:08,935
Hope you don't
mind me saying it,

486
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:11,271
but you really gave those Blood
Pack sons of bitches what‐for

487
00:26:11,271 --> 00:26:12,372
a couple of years back...

488
00:26:12,372 --> 00:26:14,274
Made me proud to be a human.

489
00:26:14,274 --> 00:26:15,676
And you are...?

490
00:26:15,676 --> 00:26:16,843
Right, where's my manners?

491
00:26:16,843 --> 00:26:18,311
Name's Messner,
private importer.

492
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:20,013
I run goods all over
the Terminus‐‐

493
00:26:20,013 --> 00:26:23,183
vehicles, consumables,
the usual boring stuff...

494
00:26:23,183 --> 00:26:24,918
It pays the bills.

495
00:26:26,953 --> 00:26:28,889
[Messner] Ah, a hero
and a gentleman!

496
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:29,990
[Messner laughs]

497
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,825
Must be nice havin' him around.

498
00:26:31,825 --> 00:26:32,959
Some would say.

499
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:35,796
Hey, wait a second...
What's that supposed to mean?

500
00:26:37,864 --> 00:26:40,100
[Messner] So, uh...
this is new...

501
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,668
You mind ringing up
the powers that be

502
00:26:41,668 --> 00:26:43,637
and gettin' this bad boy open?

503
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:46,640
[Vega] Hey, Whitman...
You gonna make me

504
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,108
say "pretty please" or what?

505
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:49,743
C'mon, man, let us in.

506
00:26:49,743 --> 00:26:52,012
Afraid I can't, Vega. I'm sorry.

507
00:26:52,012 --> 00:26:53,747
We've upped security
for classified ops

508
00:26:53,747 --> 00:26:56,082
and you're not
cleared for entry.

509
00:26:56,082 --> 00:26:57,350
You either, Doc.

510
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,285
There are materials in
the research department

511
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:01,354
that belong to me! You
cannot just lock me out!

512
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:03,323
I know, but it's not my call.

513
00:27:03,323 --> 00:27:06,092
You can lodge a complaint with
Command if you want, but...

514
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:09,763
...it's not gonna get you in
here any quicker. I'm sorry.

515
00:27:09,763 --> 00:27:12,699
[Treeya sighs] Typical...

516
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:14,367
[Vega] Hey! I'll get
your stuff back!

517
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:16,102
Let go of my arm...

518
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:19,239
Sad to say, this is the sort
of idiocy I've had to deal with

519
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:23,176
since you Alliance grunts
took over our research post.

520
00:27:23,176 --> 00:27:25,278
Like you even care.

521
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:26,212
Cut 'em some slack, huh?

522
00:27:26,212 --> 00:27:27,881
I'm sure the Alliance
has a good reason

523
00:27:27,881 --> 00:27:29,783
for locking down your lab.

524
00:27:29,783 --> 00:27:30,717
That they declined to share

525
00:27:30,717 --> 00:27:33,787
with their own security
detail? Spare me.

526
00:27:33,787 --> 00:27:38,759
Roger that... It's Captain Toni.
He wants to see us ASAP.

527
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:47,133
I can help you with
your work, Treeya, just‐‐

528
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:49,703
Really? So suddenly
you're an archaeologist?

529
00:27:49,703 --> 00:27:51,137
You don't know
anything about it.

530
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:54,107
Why, 'cause I'm a grunt? Try me.

531
00:27:54,107 --> 00:27:56,176
Vega! The boys in
Control are picking up

532
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:57,377
some kind of anomalous signal

533
00:27:57,377 --> 00:27:59,946
out of Sector Nine,
near the old ruins.

534
00:27:59,946 --> 00:28:01,481
I knew that something
seemed off...

535
00:28:01,481 --> 00:28:03,349
Whatever it is out there,
Doctor, it's playing hell

536
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,952
with our long‐range
communications.

537
00:28:05,952 --> 00:28:08,021
Might be one of your
relics. Might not be.

538
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:09,990
Either way, I need it gone.

539
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,992
Understood, Captain.
We'll take care of it.

540
00:28:11,992 --> 00:28:13,493
I want you all combat‐ready,

541
00:28:13,493 --> 00:28:15,929
in case there are any hostiles
who wanna get cute...

542
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:17,330
And last bit of bad news,

543
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:20,033
our APC is down for a
suspension overhaul,

544
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:21,101
so it looks like you'll have to

545
00:28:21,101 --> 00:28:22,736
double‐time it out
there on foot.

546
00:28:22,736 --> 00:28:23,970
[Messner clears his throat]

547
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:27,207
Had a Volus pay me in trade a
while back with a used Mako.

548
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:29,810
What say we give
it a test‐drive?

549
00:28:47,193 --> 00:28:49,362
Treeya, you and Messner
are with Milque back there.

550
00:28:49,362 --> 00:28:52,098
Mason, you be ready to
back us up with the Mako.

551
00:28:52,098 --> 00:28:53,499
Roger that.

552
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:55,802
Let's go, Delta Squad!

553
00:29:02,475 --> 00:29:04,811
Cut south and flank
the signal point.

554
00:29:04,811 --> 00:29:06,913
[Essex grunts affirmatively]

555
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:08,248
Nicky, find a good spot

556
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:10,116
for Milque to set up
his sniper rifle.

557
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:11,417
Scanning the area.

558
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:12,786
‐‐Hill looks good.
‐‐Hill looks good...

559
00:29:12,786 --> 00:29:13,887
‐‐Smart‐ass.
‐‐I just said that.

560
00:29:13,887 --> 00:29:14,921
‐‐Hill it is!
‐‐Hill it is!

561
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:16,256
Nicky... you're with me...

562
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:18,024
We're going up the middle
for a closer look.

563
00:29:18,024 --> 00:29:19,459
Yes, sir!

564
00:29:21,895 --> 00:29:23,396
[Vega] What've you got for me?

565
00:29:23,396 --> 00:29:25,365
[Nicky] I don't know
what it is, but...

566
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:28,201
...Captain Toni wasn't kidding
about the interference!

567
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:30,370
[Vega] Bounce your scan over
to the doctor's omni‐tool.

568
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,972
[Nicky] On it.

569
00:29:31,972 --> 00:29:34,140
[Vega] Is this one of
your relics, Treeya?

570
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,810
I can't make it out very
clearly in the image...

571
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,812
... but the object is not
native to this system,

572
00:29:38,812 --> 00:29:40,346
I'm sure of that much.

573
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:42,448
Never seen anything
like it before.

574
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:44,084
Didn't fall out of
the sky, either.

575
00:29:44,084 --> 00:29:46,987
That crater's too small
for a re‐entry impact.

576
00:29:46,987 --> 00:29:49,122
But hey, look on
the bright side‐‐

577
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:51,457
at least it's not
taking potshots at us.

578
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:52,458
Wherever it came from,

579
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,861
it's emitting a powerful
wide‐frequency burst;

580
00:29:54,861 --> 00:29:58,164
no question it's what's
jamming our communications.

581
00:29:58,164 --> 00:30:00,433
I think it's done enough
jamming for one day.

582
00:30:00,433 --> 00:30:02,068
[Essex] Boom time?

583
00:30:03,036 --> 00:30:05,038
No! You can't just
destroy an artifact

584
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:08,041
because you don't
understand it! Stop!

585
00:30:10,243 --> 00:30:13,046
‐‐[Treeya gasps]
‐‐Whoa, hold it there, Doc.

586
00:30:13,046 --> 00:30:14,581
[Treeya breathes]

587
00:30:14,581 --> 00:30:16,482
[Milque] That last
step's a doozy.

588
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:18,852
[Treeya gasps]

589
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:24,891
[Treeya shudders]

590
00:30:24,891 --> 00:30:25,892
[Milque chuckles]

591
00:30:25,892 --> 00:30:27,327
Graceful.

592
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:31,598
Sorry, Treeya, but this isn't
an archaeology expedition.

593
00:30:31,598 --> 00:30:32,666
Command sent us
here with orders

594
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:36,002
to take out a potential
threat, not study history.

595
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:38,304
[Milque] One more step and
she would've been history.

596
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:40,273
[Vega grunts] What
was that, Milque?

597
00:30:40,273 --> 00:30:42,876
[Treeya] Nothing!
It's nothing...

598
00:30:45,045 --> 00:30:47,514
The Mako's the other way.
Where are you going?

599
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:50,116
I can still figure out
where it came from.

600
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:52,619
I've never seen
anyplace like this.

601
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:55,656
Brutes like you could never
hope to appreciate it.

602
00:30:55,656 --> 00:30:57,290
Just don't touch anything.

603
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,259
[Mason] Wow... Still
running after, what...

604
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:01,327
five thousand years
or something?

605
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:03,029
[Treeya] Five? That's nothing.

606
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:05,566
More like seventy thousand,
at the very least.

607
00:31:05,566 --> 00:31:07,200
Seventy thousand?!

608
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,068
[Messner whistles]

609
00:31:08,068 --> 00:31:09,469
[Treeya] That shouldn't
surprise you.

610
00:31:09,469 --> 00:31:11,638
After all, the Protheans
are long gone,

611
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:13,139
but the mass relays they built

612
00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:16,042
are still the cornerstone
of intergalactic travel.

613
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:17,678
[Nicky] True enough,
but flying into a relay

614
00:31:17,678 --> 00:31:19,445
is a pretty simple task...

615
00:31:19,445 --> 00:31:23,383
What you're doing... is actively
interacting with this device!

616
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:26,319
[Treeya] Just think of it...
Civilization as we know it

617
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:29,022
depends entirely on the
mass effect fields created

618
00:31:29,022 --> 00:31:31,958
by the exposure of Element
Zero to electrical current.

619
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:34,160
Transportation...
Communication...

620
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,663
Even those weapons of
which you're so fond.

621
00:31:36,663 --> 00:31:38,532
[Messner] It is handy,
I'll give ya that...

622
00:31:38,532 --> 00:31:40,100
[Vega] So what went wrong?

623
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,035
If these Protheans
were so powerful,

624
00:31:42,035 --> 00:31:43,103
what happened to them?

625
00:31:43,103 --> 00:31:46,339
Fifty thousand years ago,
they simply vanished...

626
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:48,174
For better or worse,
Lieutenant...

627
00:31:48,174 --> 00:31:51,111
that question's become
my life's work...

628
00:31:51,111 --> 00:31:53,647
My mentor Liara T'Soni's
made great strides

629
00:31:53,647 --> 00:31:56,382
towards solving it‐‐
maybe she can help.

630
00:32:03,123 --> 00:32:05,025
Dr. Nuwani. It's
good to see you.

631
00:32:05,025 --> 00:32:07,661
You as well, Dr. T'Soni.
I found an unknown object

632
00:32:07,661 --> 00:32:11,297
in the ruins on Fehl Prime
and wanted to get your input.

633
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:13,734
[Messner] Is it my imagination,
or do they all look alike?

634
00:32:13,734 --> 00:32:15,401
[Liara] Hmm...

635
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:17,638
Well, it's not Prothean,
I can tell you that...

636
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:20,507
In fact, it doesn't match
anything I've ever seen.

637
00:32:20,507 --> 00:32:23,443
Based on the cursory
inspection I've given it so far,

638
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:26,146
these are some very
advanced bio‐mechanics.

639
00:32:26,146 --> 00:32:27,548
[Liara] This could
be Reaper tech.

640
00:32:27,548 --> 00:32:29,983
They're an ancient race of
sentient starships who've

641
00:32:29,983 --> 00:32:32,318
marked all other intelligent
life for destruction...

642
00:32:32,318 --> 00:32:33,587
Hence their attack
on the Citadel.

643
00:32:33,587 --> 00:32:36,690
[Messner] Uh, hold up‐‐that ship
went for the Alliance's jugular

644
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,592
because it wanted to?

645
00:32:38,592 --> 00:32:40,994
Don't tell me you believe that!

646
00:32:40,994 --> 00:32:43,329
With all due respect,
Dr. T'Soni, that ship

647
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:44,765
was nothing more
than a dreadnaught

648
00:32:44,765 --> 00:32:47,400
piloted by a rogue
Spectre agent.

649
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,236
I saw it, Treeya.
I heard it speak.

650
00:32:50,236 --> 00:32:52,539
What's more, I am sure that
the Reapers are responsible

651
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:55,175
for the Prothean disappearance
fifty thousand years ago.

652
00:32:55,175 --> 00:32:56,610
And now after the information‐‐

653
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:57,744
[Treeya] Dr. T'Soni?

654
00:32:57,744 --> 00:33:00,747
Nicky. Find that signal.

655
00:33:00,747 --> 00:33:03,416
So talking starships ate
your space mechanics...

656
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:05,185
You buy any of that?

657
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:09,656
I wouldn't wait on that
signal... It's long gone.

658
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:12,759
I respect Dr. T'Soni and her
contributions to the field,

659
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:15,428
but the fact remains that
none of the major civilizations

660
00:33:15,428 --> 00:33:17,631
have any record of
the Reapers' existence.

661
00:33:17,631 --> 00:33:19,666
The truth is, she's become
obsessed with them‐‐

662
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:22,769
to the detriment of her career
and her professional reputation.

663
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:23,737
She has been regarded

664
00:33:23,737 --> 00:33:26,472
as little more than a...
conspiracy theorist

665
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:28,642
ever since she ran off with
your Commander Shepard.

666
00:33:28,642 --> 00:33:32,112
Hold on! You mean she actually
knew Shepard personally?!

667
00:33:32,112 --> 00:33:34,080
Hey! Careful!

668
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,618
Finally, they got something
to talk about... Way to go.

669
00:33:37,618 --> 00:33:39,553
[Vega groans]

670
00:33:39,553 --> 00:33:41,588
[Toni] Delta Squadron!
Come in, over!

671
00:33:41,588 --> 00:33:43,356
Say again? It's no good.

672
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:46,593
We're getting that
interference again. Except...

673
00:33:46,593 --> 00:33:48,294
[Vega] Except what?

674
00:33:48,294 --> 00:33:51,064
[Nicky shudders]

675
00:33:58,505 --> 00:34:01,274
Back to the colony! Now!

676
00:34:18,158 --> 00:34:21,595
[scattered hushed dialogue]

677
00:34:21,595 --> 00:34:24,197
[colonists gasp]

678
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:28,602
[screams from crowd]

679
00:34:28,602 --> 00:34:31,672
[men scream]

680
00:34:31,672 --> 00:34:32,639
Move it, people!

681
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,640
[Toni grunts]

682
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:37,377
Go! Everyone, get to the vault!

683
00:34:37,377 --> 00:34:40,180
[Toni grunts, gasps]

684
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,893
[scattered yells and shrieks]

685
00:34:44,585 --> 00:34:47,387
[various indistinct
shouts and yells]

686
00:34:47,387 --> 00:34:49,322
[Whitman] I'm sorry,
I have my orders!

687
00:34:49,322 --> 00:34:51,625
I can't let you in without
proper authorization!

688
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:54,728
[colonist] So you're just
gonna let us die out here?

689
00:34:54,728 --> 00:34:57,531
Well, I say... screw that!

690
00:34:57,531 --> 00:35:01,401
[indistinct dialogue from crowd]

691
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:06,439
[indistinct yells and
screams from crowd]

692
00:35:07,541 --> 00:35:12,145
[pained yells and screams,
sound of gunfire]

693
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:43,777
[Milque] There...
I got multiple targets.

694
00:35:43,777 --> 00:35:46,212
[Nicky] Whoa‐‐what the
heck are those things?

695
00:35:46,212 --> 00:35:48,248
Looks like they're all
carrying weapons...

696
00:35:48,248 --> 00:35:51,384
Great, so I guess we can
rule out a social visit...

697
00:35:51,384 --> 00:35:53,654
[Nicky] I don't see
any of the colonists...

698
00:35:54,955 --> 00:35:56,456
Oh, shit... Get down!

699
00:35:56,456 --> 00:35:58,158
[grunting]

700
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,662
[Vega] You ever seen
these things before?

701
00:36:01,662 --> 00:36:04,397
No, never... Though that
ship appears to be based

702
00:36:04,397 --> 00:36:07,701
on the same technology
as the object we found.

703
00:36:07,701 --> 00:36:10,370
[Vega] Alright‐‐then until we
know what's going on here,

704
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:13,473
we assume they're hostile.
We go in stealth for recon,

705
00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:17,243
through the sinkhole,
below their sight lines. Clear?

706
00:36:17,243 --> 00:36:20,514
Vega, maybe someone
should stay back on lookout?

707
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:22,749
Someone's gotta watch the Mako.

708
00:36:25,485 --> 00:36:28,789
[Kamille] Right‐‐more like
someone's gotta grow a pair.

709
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:30,591
Just sayin'.

710
00:36:45,606 --> 00:36:47,741
[Essex grunts]

711
00:36:47,741 --> 00:36:48,842
[Vega] Come on.

712
00:36:48,842 --> 00:36:50,476
Watch your step.

713
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,416
[Vega and Treeya gasp]
[Essex gasps]

714
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:06,593
Where's Vega and Treeya?

715
00:37:06,593 --> 00:37:08,428
[Kamille] Still over there.

716
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,022
Great, so they can fly...

717
00:37:36,022 --> 00:37:38,525
Suddenly, I'm missin'
the Blood Pack...

718
00:37:44,798 --> 00:37:46,432
[Vega sniffs]

719
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,835
Come on.

720
00:37:50,671 --> 00:37:53,540
[Essex] Man, there's
swarms of 'em up there...

721
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,476
So where do you think
all the colonists went?

722
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:00,714
[Vega] Stay here!

723
00:38:02,315 --> 00:38:05,852
[Vega] Hey... Can you hear me?

724
00:38:05,852 --> 00:38:09,723
He's got a pulse...
It's like he's been...

725
00:38:09,723 --> 00:38:11,592
... paralyzed...

726
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:17,698
What the hell...?

727
00:38:17,698 --> 00:38:20,333
There's no visible
signs of battle...

728
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:21,401
[woman's voice screams]

729
00:38:21,401 --> 00:38:22,836
[Vega] Let's go!

730
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:30,076
[Vega] Hold up.

731
00:38:30,076 --> 00:38:32,012
Okay, we're close,
but we're about

732
00:38:32,012 --> 00:38:33,479
to lose our overhead cover.

733
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:35,982
We'll be easy to spot
if we move as a group.

734
00:38:35,982 --> 00:38:38,852
All of you stay here
while I check it out.

735
00:38:38,852 --> 00:38:40,521
[Vega grunts]

736
00:38:40,521 --> 00:38:41,522
I'm coming with you!

737
00:38:41,522 --> 00:38:43,389
Wait! Treeya!

738
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:48,729
Vega...

739
00:38:48,729 --> 00:38:50,864
Cállate.

740
00:38:50,864 --> 00:38:52,766
[Treeya exhales]

741
00:38:54,134 --> 00:38:56,803
[Treeya sighs]

742
00:38:56,803 --> 00:38:58,739
I told you to stay.

743
00:39:00,807 --> 00:39:02,475
[Vega] Fine.

744
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:08,114
[April pants intensely]

745
00:39:08,114 --> 00:39:09,950
[April] Mommy! Help!

746
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,918
[Christine] April! We've gotta
keep running, baby!

747
00:39:11,918 --> 00:39:14,821
[Christine pants,
April whimpers]

748
00:39:14,821 --> 00:39:16,489
[Christine gasps]

749
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:17,624
[April shudders]

750
00:39:17,624 --> 00:39:19,459
Mommy!!

751
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:21,628
[Vega grunts]

752
00:39:21,628 --> 00:39:22,629
[Vega] No...

753
00:39:22,629 --> 00:39:23,630
[Vega pants]

754
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:26,967
[Vega] Christine...? Damn it!

755
00:39:26,967 --> 00:39:27,934
[Vega grunts]

756
00:39:27,934 --> 00:39:31,004
[Vega] April? No...
No, no, no, no, no, no!

757
00:39:31,004 --> 00:39:33,907
You gotta hang on for
me there, soldier...

758
00:39:33,907 --> 00:39:37,844
I'll find a way to save you...
Yo prometo...

759
00:39:38,845 --> 00:39:39,813
[Treeya] Are they...?

760
00:39:39,813 --> 00:39:42,916
[Vega] No... Just paralyzed,
like the others.

761
00:39:42,916 --> 00:39:44,651
They're coming... This way!

762
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:46,086
[Treeya gasps]

763
00:39:54,761 --> 00:39:56,997
[Treeya] What are they doing?

764
00:39:58,999 --> 00:40:01,602
[Treeya gasps]

765
00:40:01,602 --> 00:40:03,904
[Vega] We go out there now,
we just get ourselves killed.

766
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:06,006
There'll be a chance
to help them...

767
00:40:06,006 --> 00:40:08,509
But we have got to be smart.

768
00:40:10,777 --> 00:40:12,613
[Vega] Let's get
back to the squad...

769
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:18,585
[Mason] We saw 'em carrying
people off in those pod things.

770
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:21,722
Question is, what for?

771
00:40:21,722 --> 00:40:23,489
[Essex] Gotta be for
some kinda experiments

772
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:24,891
or somethin', ya think?

773
00:40:24,891 --> 00:40:27,193
Yeah, or maybe for food.

774
00:40:27,193 --> 00:40:29,462
[disapproving grunts]

775
00:40:29,462 --> 00:40:30,997
Or maybe not.

776
00:40:30,997 --> 00:40:32,899
I don't give a damn
what their reasons are.

777
00:40:32,899 --> 00:40:35,902
All I care about now is
getting everyone back safely.

778
00:40:35,902 --> 00:40:37,237
Let's save the
"why's" for later

779
00:40:37,237 --> 00:40:39,740
and start coming up
with a plan of attack.

780
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,976
For starters, how 'bout we get
ahold of some bigger guns?

781
00:40:42,976 --> 00:40:43,977
Yo, Nicky.

782
00:40:43,977 --> 00:40:44,978
Yes, sir.

783
00:40:44,978 --> 00:40:45,979
[Vega] Check our stores;

784
00:40:45,979 --> 00:40:48,815
see what we've got that
can take on that ship.

785
00:40:48,815 --> 00:40:50,917
Well, not to interrupt, but...

786
00:40:50,917 --> 00:40:53,787
is that big cannon
just for show?

787
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:57,824
[Vega] Right. Here's the plan.

788
00:40:57,824 --> 00:40:59,760
We make our way to the
top of the security tower

789
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,127
to activate the turret.

790
00:41:01,127 --> 00:41:04,497
But we'll need a diversion
while it's powering up.

791
00:41:04,497 --> 00:41:07,200
Flyboy, you light up the fuel
stores to draw 'em away from us,

792
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,103
then you run like hell. Got it?

793
00:41:10,103 --> 00:41:13,006
[Mason] Shit, I'm gonna
quit for real this time.

794
00:41:13,006 --> 00:41:14,040
[Vega] The rest of
us will move up

795
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,909
along the
maintenance scaffolds.

796
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:18,679
Milque, I'm counting on
you to watch our backs.

797
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:19,946
[Milque] Mm‐hmm...

798
00:41:19,946 --> 00:41:23,183
Just once, I wish someone would
watch my back for a change...

799
00:41:30,591 --> 00:41:32,993
I can't even count all
these damn things!

800
00:41:38,198 --> 00:41:41,568
[Vega] Essex, Kamille‐‐you two
stand here and stay guard.

801
00:41:41,568 --> 00:41:42,903
Alright, let's move!

802
00:41:42,903 --> 00:41:44,037
Lead the way, chief.

803
00:41:44,037 --> 00:41:47,107
[sound of footsteps,
trailing off]

804
00:41:47,107 --> 00:41:50,076
Hey. What do ya know?
We're finally alone.

805
00:41:50,076 --> 00:41:51,912
Don't you ever quit?

806
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:57,684
Now, we can get this
thing online, right?

807
00:41:57,684 --> 00:41:59,953
Absolutely.
That's the easy part.

808
00:41:59,953 --> 00:42:03,657
Problem's gonna be waiting
for the cannon to fully charge.

809
00:42:03,657 --> 00:42:04,591
It's probably a good idea

810
00:42:04,591 --> 00:42:07,628
to stay away from the
windows right now.

811
00:42:07,628 --> 00:42:10,163
[Treeya] What's happening
to our people, Lieutenant?

812
00:42:10,163 --> 00:42:12,666
[Vega] Hold on... We
can track their omnis

813
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:14,968
to see where
they've been taken.

814
00:42:14,968 --> 00:42:17,704
Okay, here it is.
Looks likes the hostiles

815
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:19,339
have 'em split
into two groups...

816
00:42:19,339 --> 00:42:23,309
[Treeya] So they're being
stowed for transport? But why?

817
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:25,311
[Nicky] Cannon fifty
percent charged.

818
00:42:25,311 --> 00:42:28,114
[Vega] Ahh...! This is
taking way too long.

819
00:42:28,114 --> 00:42:29,249
Any way to speed things up?

820
00:42:29,249 --> 00:42:31,184
[Nicky] I'm doing
what I can, sir.

821
00:42:31,184 --> 00:42:33,086
[Messner] Yeah, well,
it's not enough.

822
00:42:33,086 --> 00:42:34,287
The bugs are
gonna start heading

823
00:42:34,287 --> 00:42:36,590
back this way any second.

824
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,792
Can we activate the turret
with the charge we've got?

825
00:42:38,792 --> 00:42:41,061
Well, theoretically, but
there's no way of knowing

826
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:43,096
whether or not it'll
do any damage.

827
00:42:43,096 --> 00:42:44,931
Wouldn't decreased
destructive power

828
00:42:44,931 --> 00:42:46,166
be ideal in this situation?

829
00:42:46,166 --> 00:42:49,703
We want to minimize the risk
to the colonists on board, yes?

830
00:42:49,703 --> 00:42:52,906
Good point. We'll fire
with what's built up.

831
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:57,678
Looks like they've got it ready.

832
00:42:57,678 --> 00:42:59,713
Sure took 'em long enough.

833
00:43:08,655 --> 00:43:12,392
Alright. The turret's in
position. Awaiting your order.

834
00:43:12,392 --> 00:43:14,027
Fire!

835
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:21,968
[Nicky] Our shot's
been deflected!

836
00:43:21,968 --> 00:43:23,970
[Vega] Son of a...! Damn it!

837
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:26,172
[Nicky] Enemy drones
en route, sir!

838
00:43:26,172 --> 00:43:28,975
Go! All of you!
Nicky, stay with Messner!

839
00:43:28,975 --> 00:43:30,176
[Nicky] Yes, sir!

840
00:43:30,176 --> 00:43:33,079
[Vega] Treeya...
Hey, snap out of it!

841
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:34,781
Let's go! Treeya!

842
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:36,282
[Treeya shudders]

843
00:43:38,051 --> 00:43:39,886
[Vega] Dios mio...

844
00:43:45,926 --> 00:43:48,094
[Milque] Shit,
that's not good...

845
00:43:48,094 --> 00:43:49,763
Aah!

846
00:43:50,931 --> 00:43:53,099
‐‐[Milque] Mason!
‐‐Yeah, you can thank me later.

847
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:55,301
Now how 'bout we get
the hell outta here?

848
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:59,072
[Vega grunts, yells]

849
00:43:59,072 --> 00:44:01,141
[Treeya cries out]

850
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:03,844
[Vega braces]

851
00:44:03,844 --> 00:44:05,879
[Vega] Hang on to me!

852
00:44:05,879 --> 00:44:08,849
[Vega and Treeya grunt]

853
00:44:14,788 --> 00:44:15,889
We made it...

854
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:17,323
[Vega] Not yet.

855
00:44:17,323 --> 00:44:20,193
Come on... Jump!

856
00:44:21,828 --> 00:44:23,229
[Essex] Vega!

857
00:44:23,229 --> 00:44:25,331
[Kamille] Vega!
Treeya! Over here!

858
00:44:25,331 --> 00:44:26,466
[Vega grunts]

859
00:44:26,466 --> 00:44:29,402
[Essex] Almost there!
You got it!

860
00:44:29,402 --> 00:44:31,204
[Kamille] You better
get her inside.

861
00:44:39,312 --> 00:44:40,313
[Essex grunts]

862
00:44:40,313 --> 00:44:41,414
I'm out!

863
00:44:41,414 --> 00:44:44,050
[Essex] Guns are no good
against these swarms anyway!

864
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:46,052
Get below with the others!

865
00:44:46,052 --> 00:44:47,020
[Kamille] Gah!

866
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,422
[Kamille struggles, screams]

867
00:44:49,422 --> 00:44:51,057
Kamille!

868
00:44:59,766 --> 00:45:02,268
[Vega] What's the hold‐up,
Nicky?! Get the door closed!

869
00:45:02,268 --> 00:45:03,837
Almost there!

870
00:45:03,837 --> 00:45:05,238
[Vega] Hurry!

871
00:45:05,238 --> 00:45:07,240
[Vega growls]

872
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,943
[Essex] Son of a bitch‐‐
they just keep coming!

873
00:45:12,478 --> 00:45:14,114
[Milque] Comin' through!

874
00:45:15,081 --> 00:45:16,316
I'll be damned...

875
00:45:16,316 --> 00:45:17,951
[Mason exhales]

876
00:45:21,522 --> 00:45:24,257
[Mason] I think that
oughta buy us some time...

877
00:45:24,257 --> 00:45:25,826
[Vega] How we doin'
on the door, Nicky?

878
00:45:25,826 --> 00:45:28,494
All over it, sir...
I'm sealing it up now.

879
00:45:28,494 --> 00:45:30,296
[Vega] Everybody, inside!

880
00:45:30,296 --> 00:45:31,331
Where the hell's Kammy?

881
00:45:31,331 --> 00:45:33,166
[Essex sighs]

882
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:35,235
I'm sorry, man. They got her.

883
00:45:35,235 --> 00:45:36,436
[Mason gasps]

884
00:45:36,436 --> 00:45:40,173
What?! How?! I thought you
were supposed to have her back!

885
00:45:40,173 --> 00:45:41,374
[Essex] Oh, shit!

886
00:45:41,374 --> 00:45:42,242
[Mason grunts]

887
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:43,443
[Essex and Mason yell]

888
00:45:43,443 --> 00:45:44,645
[Vega] What's going on?

889
00:45:44,645 --> 00:45:47,247
Little ones, crawling through
the gaps! They're inside!

890
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:49,349
Just go, Mason! Move it!

891
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:51,284
Guns don't work on
these little bastards!

892
00:45:51,284 --> 00:45:53,353
I'll have to use my
biotics to hold 'em back!

893
00:45:53,353 --> 00:45:56,122
[Nicky] Door's closing, people!
Stand clear of the hatch!

894
00:45:56,122 --> 00:45:58,124
Come on, you two,
stop screwin' around!

895
00:45:58,124 --> 00:46:00,126
[Mason grunts]

896
00:46:00,126 --> 00:46:02,095
[Mason] Essex, you
dumbass! Get in here!

897
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:04,430
You're steppin' all
over my big moment!

898
00:46:05,932 --> 00:46:10,403
C'mon, man... Just trying
to look cool before I die...

899
00:46:12,138 --> 00:46:16,076
[Vega and Milque pant]

900
00:46:21,347 --> 00:46:23,249
Alliance Command,
this is Fehl Prime...

901
00:46:23,249 --> 00:46:24,818
The colony is under attack...

902
00:46:24,818 --> 00:46:27,187
Repeat, the colony
is under attack...

903
00:46:27,187 --> 00:46:29,956
Alliance Command, do you co‐‐

904
00:46:29,956 --> 00:46:30,924
[Vega] How's Essex?

905
00:46:30,924 --> 00:46:33,459
[Milque] He got stung,
but... he's alive...

906
00:46:33,459 --> 00:46:34,928
It's only a matter of time

907
00:46:34,928 --> 00:46:37,998
before they figure
out where we are.

908
00:46:37,998 --> 00:46:41,201
I'm with the doc. We're
sittin' ducks in this place.

909
00:46:41,201 --> 00:46:44,404
Here... I say we get to the
shuttle and break for orbit.

910
00:46:44,404 --> 00:46:47,407
Now you're talking. We can send
out a distress call to Alliance

911
00:46:47,407 --> 00:46:49,209
once we're clear of
the jamming signal.

912
00:46:49,209 --> 00:46:52,278
Uh, sir. Are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

913
00:47:01,855 --> 00:47:02,989
[gasps]

914
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:06,359
[Mason] Son of a bitch...
You're kidding me, right?

915
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:08,962
[Messner sighs] You should
have waited, Lieutenant.

916
00:47:08,962 --> 00:47:11,264
[Mason exhales lightly]

917
00:47:11,264 --> 00:47:13,066
"Should have waited"? For what?

918
00:47:13,066 --> 00:47:14,034
[Treeya moans]

919
00:47:14,034 --> 00:47:15,468
[Messner] The cannon
was only at half power

920
00:47:15,468 --> 00:47:17,203
when he fired on their ship.

921
00:47:17,203 --> 00:47:19,472
[Mason] That true?

922
00:47:19,472 --> 00:47:22,275
Our only shot, and you blew it?

923
00:47:22,275 --> 00:47:23,143
It was my fault.

924
00:47:23,143 --> 00:47:25,311
I made the call...
I was just trying

925
00:47:25,311 --> 00:47:27,247
to minimize any
collateral damage.

926
00:47:27,247 --> 00:47:30,584
"Collateral damage"?! What the
hell you call all this, man?!

927
00:47:30,584 --> 00:47:32,586
We lost Kamille out there!

928
00:47:32,586 --> 00:47:36,590
I know! But I haven't
given up on Kamille yet‐‐

929
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:38,592
or any of our people!

930
00:47:38,592 --> 00:47:40,561
We fight smart,
we fight together,

931
00:47:40,561 --> 00:47:44,397
and we will get them
back! Who's with me?!

932
00:47:48,468 --> 00:47:53,273
I am, sir... We're Marines,
it's what we do.

933
00:47:53,273 --> 00:47:55,341
Now, if Essex is still
alive out there,

934
00:47:55,341 --> 00:47:57,143
then I'm goin' out to get him.

935
00:47:57,143 --> 00:47:58,612
I'll help.

936
00:48:09,455 --> 00:48:12,025
[Vega] How's he
holding up, Nicky?

937
00:48:12,025 --> 00:48:13,026
[Nicky] There's been no trauma

938
00:48:13,026 --> 00:48:15,596
to his circulatory or
respiratory systems...

939
00:48:15,596 --> 00:48:18,198
[Treeya] And no sign of
neurological impairment.

940
00:48:18,198 --> 00:48:19,465
[Nicky] He just can't move.

941
00:48:19,465 --> 00:48:22,402
We'll get you back on your feet,
Essex. You just hang in there.

942
00:48:22,402 --> 00:48:25,038
Not like he's got a choice...

943
00:48:25,038 --> 00:48:27,674
[Nicky] Entire colonies
vanishing overnight...

944
00:48:27,674 --> 00:48:31,011
I thought it was just a
silly rumor... but now...

945
00:48:31,011 --> 00:48:32,278
[Treeya] The Alliance
must not have known

946
00:48:32,278 --> 00:48:34,247
what sort of foe they
were up against...

947
00:48:34,247 --> 00:48:35,949
I mean, they certainly
didn't prepare

948
00:48:35,949 --> 00:48:37,684
any of us for this contingency.

949
00:48:37,684 --> 00:48:39,953
They lacked the proper intel...

950
00:48:39,953 --> 00:48:41,121
It looks as though
they did know

951
00:48:41,121 --> 00:48:43,056
about the bugs and
their paralytic sting,

952
00:48:43,056 --> 00:48:44,591
but I'm not seeing
anything on file

953
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:47,427
about those humanoid
raiders or their ship.

954
00:48:47,427 --> 00:48:50,296
Wait... There's a note at
the bottom of this report...

955
00:48:50,296 --> 00:48:53,600
Something about work having been
done on a potential antidote...?

956
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,702
Good catch...
Keep poking around...

957
00:48:55,702 --> 00:48:56,870
If they perfected a cure,

958
00:48:56,870 --> 00:49:00,273
I want to track it down and
stick Essex with it ASAP.

959
00:49:00,273 --> 00:49:02,576
‐‐[Nicky] Vega!
‐‐What'd you find?

960
00:49:02,576 --> 00:49:04,511
[Nicky] A file on
our new friend.

961
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,112
He's one of the
reasons security's

962
00:49:06,112 --> 00:49:08,014
been beefed up around here.

963
00:49:08,014 --> 00:49:11,084
According to the Alliance,
Messner's been spying on us

964
00:49:11,084 --> 00:49:14,655
and reporting back to his
employer... AKA Cerberus.

965
00:49:14,655 --> 00:49:15,656
[Vega] What?!

966
00:49:15,656 --> 00:49:17,524
[Messner] Well,
this is awkward.

967
00:49:17,524 --> 00:49:19,092
[Treeya] Wait, what is Cerberus?

968
00:49:19,092 --> 00:49:21,427
[Vega] A bunch of damn
human supremacists!

969
00:49:21,427 --> 00:49:22,663
[Messner scoffs] Says you...

970
00:49:22,663 --> 00:49:24,497
[Vega growls] Pendejo!

971
00:49:24,497 --> 00:49:26,700
[Messner] Temper, temper...!

972
00:49:28,234 --> 00:49:31,004
They think humans should
be top dog in the galaxy,

973
00:49:31,004 --> 00:49:33,039
and do whatever it takes
to make that happen,

974
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:34,708
no matter who gets
caught in the crossfire!

975
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:37,377
[Messner] You get that
from a leaflet, Vega...?

976
00:49:37,377 --> 00:49:39,646
Hey, I know our bosses
don't see eye‐to‐eye,

977
00:49:39,646 --> 00:49:42,182
but we're on the same
team for a change.

978
00:49:42,182 --> 00:49:44,651
Cerberus was trying to
cook up an antidote, too...

979
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:47,087
They wanted me to figure
out the abductions...

980
00:49:47,087 --> 00:49:50,390
Think of all the people
we can save with this info!

981
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:52,158
[Vega] We still don't know
who these bastards are.

982
00:49:52,158 --> 00:49:54,327
[Messner grunts]
Cerberus knows...

983
00:49:54,327 --> 00:49:57,230
Knowing stuff is
kind of our thing.

984
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:59,633
We've taken to calling
'em... Collectors.

985
00:49:59,633 --> 00:50:00,601
[Mason] Bullshit.

986
00:50:00,601 --> 00:50:02,603
Hey, we're a group with
a profound distrust

987
00:50:02,603 --> 00:50:04,505
of alien species.

988
00:50:04,505 --> 00:50:07,340
We keep tabs on all of 'em,
even the mythical ones...

989
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:08,709
In stories, they show up,

990
00:50:08,709 --> 00:50:11,111
"collect" some
unwitting species,

991
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:14,380
and take it back home,
beyond some distant mass relay.

992
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,049
[Vega] Yeah? What for?

993
00:50:16,049 --> 00:50:17,551
[Messner] Your guess
is as good as mine...

994
00:50:17,551 --> 00:50:19,620
They don't leave a
forwarding address,

995
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:22,155
and it's a one‐way trip
for whatever they grab...

996
00:50:22,155 --> 00:50:25,258
That's everything Cerberus
knows about 'em, honest.

997
00:50:25,258 --> 00:50:26,527
[Treeya] I very much doubt that.

998
00:50:26,527 --> 00:50:28,194
Hey... come on...

999
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:32,666
I can't help but wonder if these
"Collectors" had anything to do

1000
00:50:32,666 --> 00:50:35,468
with the mass disappearance
of the Protheans.

1001
00:50:35,468 --> 00:50:37,403
[repetitive, echoing thud]

1002
00:50:37,403 --> 00:50:38,404
[Milque] What was that?!

1003
00:50:38,404 --> 00:50:40,140
[Messner] I didn't do it.

1004
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:43,243
[Vega exhales] It's
coming from downstairs!

1005
00:50:45,612 --> 00:50:49,482
[Brood grunts]

1006
00:50:52,853 --> 00:50:55,455
I remember you...

1007
00:50:55,455 --> 00:50:57,691
The Alliance marines who
bested the Blood Pack,

1008
00:50:57,691 --> 00:51:01,394
and their battlemaster, Vega.

1009
00:51:01,394 --> 00:51:02,829
Thought they shipped
you off to the Citadel

1010
00:51:02,829 --> 00:51:04,831
months ago to stand trial.

1011
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,499
They didn't have the quad.

1012
00:51:06,499 --> 00:51:08,434
So they kept me here
as a test subject.

1013
00:51:08,434 --> 00:51:11,404
Figured it was safer
than transporting me.

1014
00:51:11,404 --> 00:51:12,539
I know the score, human.

1015
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:14,274
You're outnumbered
and outgunned,

1016
00:51:14,274 --> 00:51:16,176
but I can get you
off this rock.

1017
00:51:16,176 --> 00:51:19,345
All you have to do
is open the cage.

1018
00:51:19,345 --> 00:51:21,281
[Milque] Keep on dreaming, ugly.

1019
00:51:21,281 --> 00:51:23,483
You're still a Blood
Pack mercenary.

1020
00:51:23,483 --> 00:51:26,286
I think we'll take our
chances with the bugs.

1021
00:51:26,286 --> 00:51:29,222
[Mason huffs]

1022
00:51:29,222 --> 00:51:31,558
[Brood] Mmm...

1023
00:51:43,804 --> 00:51:47,473
[Treeya] Vega? Are you alright?

1024
00:51:47,473 --> 00:51:49,142
[Vega] Christine and April...

1025
00:51:49,142 --> 00:51:52,312
They counted on me
to protect them.

1026
00:51:52,312 --> 00:51:55,516
Do you think I made the wrong
decision back there, Treeya?

1027
00:51:57,317 --> 00:52:00,320
I think you did what any
good leader would do...

1028
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,388
There was no "right"
choice, so you made

1029
00:52:02,388 --> 00:52:04,525
what you thought was
the "best" choice.

1030
00:52:06,927 --> 00:52:08,461
If I were Commander Shepard,

1031
00:52:08,461 --> 00:52:11,532
I would have found a way
to save all those people.

1032
00:52:11,532 --> 00:52:15,201
Well, you're not Shepard;
you're James Vega.

1033
00:52:15,201 --> 00:52:16,803
You know, it's funny‐‐
Admiral Hackett gave me

1034
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:18,672
some similar advice once...

1035
00:52:22,543 --> 00:52:25,546
I know how hard you try
to protect everyone...

1036
00:52:25,546 --> 00:52:29,415
Sometimes, circumstances
make that impossible...

1037
00:52:29,415 --> 00:52:31,885
You can't blame yourself, James.

1038
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,428
Vega! Doc! I think
I found something

1039
00:52:42,428 --> 00:52:44,230
you're gonna want to see...!

1040
00:52:46,533 --> 00:52:48,234
[Nicky] I've been looking
through these science files

1041
00:52:48,234 --> 00:52:49,770
like you told me to,
and I tracked down

1042
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:51,337
the latest version
of the antidote.

1043
00:52:51,337 --> 00:52:54,808
It tested at a
success rate of 69%.

1044
00:52:54,808 --> 00:52:57,711
How many humans have they
tried this stuff out on, Nicky?

1045
00:52:57,711 --> 00:52:59,780
Essex would be the first.

1046
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:01,948
[Vega sighs] Guess we don't
have much of a choice...

1047
00:53:04,551 --> 00:53:07,320
[Treeya] This is the one, Vega.

1048
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,822
How do we know
it won't kill him?

1049
00:53:08,822 --> 00:53:13,393
We don't... But Essex is a
stubborn bastard. Do it, Treeya.

1050
00:53:13,393 --> 00:53:15,696
[Treeya] Administering antidote.

1051
00:53:19,232 --> 00:53:21,568
[Nicky sighs]
Metabolic‐stasis...

1052
00:53:21,568 --> 00:53:23,704
[Vega] English, Nicky.

1053
00:53:23,704 --> 00:53:25,371
[Nicky] It's not working.

1054
00:53:25,371 --> 00:53:27,207
[Vega sighs]

1055
00:53:28,842 --> 00:53:31,377
[repetitive, echoing thud]

1056
00:53:31,377 --> 00:53:32,345
[gasps]

1057
00:53:32,345 --> 00:53:34,014
That krogan doesn't
know when to give up.

1058
00:53:34,014 --> 00:53:34,881
[Vega growls]

1059
00:53:34,881 --> 00:53:37,584
Vega... We got
company... It's for you.

1060
00:53:37,584 --> 00:53:39,219
[booming thud]

1061
00:53:40,253 --> 00:53:41,688
[Vega grunts lightly]

1062
00:53:44,591 --> 00:53:46,292
So what is it?

1063
00:53:46,292 --> 00:53:49,896
[Milque] Nothing friendly,
that's for sure.

1064
00:53:49,896 --> 00:53:51,765
Here they come.

1065
00:53:59,873 --> 00:54:01,341
[Mason grunts]

1066
00:54:01,341 --> 00:54:03,009
[electronic zipping noise]

1067
00:54:03,009 --> 00:54:04,645
[Mason gasps]

1068
00:54:11,284 --> 00:54:12,719
[Mason] Kamille...?

1069
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:14,988
That you? Kammy?!

1070
00:54:14,988 --> 00:54:16,557
Wait! Mason!

1071
00:54:16,557 --> 00:54:21,662
[Mason pants, laughs]

1072
00:54:21,662 --> 00:54:23,296
[Milque] Mason!

1073
00:54:24,464 --> 00:54:27,834
[Milque] Shit! What the
hell is that thing?!

1074
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:33,439
[Vega] Fall back! Nicky,
find us a way outta here!

1075
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:39,780
[Milque] That armor's
too damn thick!

1076
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,782
[NIcky] All clear...! This way!

1077
00:54:45,752 --> 00:54:46,887
Treeya...!

1078
00:54:46,887 --> 00:54:50,390
[Treeya pants]
What about him...?

1079
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:51,391
[creature roars]

1080
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,826
[Vega] No time!

1081
00:54:54,494 --> 00:54:57,998
[Treeya and Vega pant]

1082
00:54:57,998 --> 00:55:00,534
[Nicky] I'm locking down the
security doors behind us.

1083
00:55:00,534 --> 00:55:01,902
It should buy us a minute!

1084
00:55:01,902 --> 00:55:03,369
[Vega] Nice work, Nicky!

1085
00:55:03,369 --> 00:55:04,370
[panting continues]

1086
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:05,606
[Vega] Hey, hold up!

1087
00:55:05,606 --> 00:55:07,808
What's wrong, sir...?
The exit is this way!

1088
00:55:07,808 --> 00:55:10,844
[Vega] We're taking a
quick detour... Follow me!

1089
00:55:13,747 --> 00:55:16,016
[Vega] You said you can
get us off this planet.

1090
00:55:16,016 --> 00:55:17,618
You ready to make good?

1091
00:55:17,618 --> 00:55:18,952
I had a ship hidden nearby;

1092
00:55:18,952 --> 00:55:21,454
as far as I know,
it's still there.

1093
00:55:21,454 --> 00:55:24,024
[Treeya] He's lying!
We can't trust him...

1094
00:55:24,024 --> 00:55:26,026
[Vega] We have to
trust him, Treeya...

1095
00:55:26,026 --> 00:55:26,993
We've got nothing to lose;

1096
00:55:26,993 --> 00:55:30,130
if he can't help us,
everyone dies, him too.

1097
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:33,834
Heh. You spared my life
two years ago, Vega.

1098
00:55:33,834 --> 00:55:36,970
I repay my debts.
Now... let's hurry.

1099
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:44,978
[Nicky] All clear!

1100
00:55:44,978 --> 00:55:46,613
[Brood] This way!

1101
00:55:47,614 --> 00:55:50,483
[Brood roars]

1102
00:55:50,483 --> 00:55:52,052
[Brood] Get in.

1103
00:55:56,723 --> 00:55:58,391
[Brood] Now... where to?

1104
00:55:58,391 --> 00:56:00,894
[Vega] Anywhere...
Just get us outta here!

1105
00:56:05,532 --> 00:56:06,733
What's going on?

1106
00:56:06,733 --> 00:56:09,135
[Brood] Hard to say...
Friends of yours?

1107
00:56:27,153 --> 00:56:29,823
[Vega growls]

1108
00:56:29,823 --> 00:56:32,626
[Vega] Keep it off us! Hit it
with everything you've got!

1109
00:56:35,562 --> 00:56:36,396
Ahh!

1110
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:38,699
[Milque] Any better
ideas, chief?!

1111
00:56:41,167 --> 00:56:43,069
[Vega] Don't stop! Keep firing!

1112
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:46,907
[grunts]

1113
00:56:48,108 --> 00:56:50,577
[Milque] How many arms
does this thing got?!

1114
00:56:51,612 --> 00:56:53,714
Vega!

1115
00:56:53,714 --> 00:56:54,715
[Nicky] Augh!

1116
00:56:54,715 --> 00:56:57,050
[Vega] Nicky!!

1117
00:56:58,919 --> 00:57:03,590
[Vega gasps]

1118
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:14,768
[Essex] Ha, ha, ha!

1119
00:57:14,768 --> 00:57:15,969
[Essex roars]

1120
00:57:15,969 --> 00:57:19,205
What the hell...?
Hey, it's Essex!

1121
00:57:19,205 --> 00:57:22,676
[Essex yells, grunts]

1122
00:57:22,676 --> 00:57:23,977
[Vega] Outta the way!

1123
00:57:23,977 --> 00:57:25,579
[Vega grunts]

1124
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:27,013
[Vega groans]

1125
00:57:28,481 --> 00:57:31,585
[Vega growls]

1126
00:57:32,986 --> 00:57:34,655
Chew on this!

1127
00:57:41,662 --> 00:57:43,029
[Vega pants]

1128
00:57:43,029 --> 00:57:46,600
Heads up, Vega...! I'm comin'!

1129
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,234
[Essex] Got'cha!

1130
00:57:52,973 --> 00:57:59,646
[creature shrieks]

1131
00:58:01,815 --> 00:58:03,183
[Nicky shudders]

1132
00:58:03,183 --> 00:58:04,217
[Vega] Nicky!

1133
00:58:04,217 --> 00:58:05,852
How bad is it?

1134
00:58:07,921 --> 00:58:12,125
That depends, sir...
Does... anyone else see Essex?

1135
00:58:12,125 --> 00:58:14,561
It's really me, kid...
Still in the flesh,

1136
00:58:14,561 --> 00:58:17,263
thanks to you...
Your antidote worked.

1137
00:58:19,733 --> 00:58:21,267
We did it, Doc.

1138
00:58:21,267 --> 00:58:25,171
You did real good, Nicky...
Now, you hold on, Marine.

1139
00:58:25,171 --> 00:58:31,244
I'm with you, sir... We've
still gotta save our people...

1140
00:58:31,244 --> 00:58:34,147
[Nicky exhales weakly]

1141
00:58:36,717 --> 00:58:38,885
[Vega sighs]

1142
00:58:38,885 --> 00:58:40,521
No...

1143
00:58:42,556 --> 00:58:44,224
[Messner] That's a damn shame...

1144
00:58:51,297 --> 00:58:53,166
So... what do we do now?

1145
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:55,702
We'll be lucky to get off
the ground in this bucket...

1146
00:58:55,702 --> 00:58:58,605
Oh, she'll get off the
ground‐‐I guarantee that!

1147
00:58:58,605 --> 00:59:01,074
I just won't promise
how far she'll go...

1148
00:59:01,074 --> 00:59:02,108
Then how 'bout the old ruins;

1149
00:59:02,108 --> 00:59:03,644
can we make it
at least that far?

1150
00:59:03,644 --> 00:59:05,211
It's gotta be better than here.

1151
00:59:05,211 --> 00:59:07,013
What's the difference?
They'll shoot us down

1152
00:59:07,013 --> 00:59:09,149
the second we're airborne.

1153
00:59:09,149 --> 00:59:11,351
[Messner] Any way you slice it,
our odds are long.

1154
00:59:11,351 --> 00:59:14,320
Collectors don't make a
habit of leaving witnesses.

1155
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,989
Do you have any weapons?

1156
00:59:15,989 --> 00:59:18,191
Hmph! What kind of
a question is that?

1157
00:59:18,191 --> 00:59:20,128
You're speaking to a krogan.

1158
00:59:23,163 --> 00:59:25,966
[Brood] We live for weapons.

1159
00:59:25,966 --> 00:59:27,267
[Vega] Our only real option now

1160
00:59:27,267 --> 00:59:30,203
is to complete our
initial objective...

1161
00:59:30,203 --> 00:59:32,806
We have to disable the
Collector ship's engines...

1162
00:59:32,806 --> 00:59:34,975
But we'll have to do
it from the inside.

1163
00:59:34,975 --> 00:59:36,677
What? That's suicide!

1164
00:59:36,677 --> 00:59:38,812
The creepy eye thing'll
open up before we get close!

1165
00:59:38,812 --> 00:59:42,182
We'd be... well... evaporated.

1166
00:59:42,182 --> 00:59:44,117
That's just about
the gist of it.

1167
00:59:44,117 --> 00:59:46,152
[Messner] Hell, even
factoring out the eye,

1168
00:59:46,152 --> 00:59:48,188
we'd never break
through their shields.

1169
00:59:48,188 --> 00:59:50,991
Why not fly directly
into the eye?

1170
00:59:50,991 --> 00:59:52,959
Take the fight to them
and punch through

1171
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:54,828
where they least expect it.

1172
00:59:57,163 --> 00:59:59,065
What...? It's an idea.

1173
00:59:59,065 --> 01:00:00,734
As crazy as that sounds...

1174
01:00:00,734 --> 01:00:03,970
I think you might actually
be on to something there.

1175
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:05,806
Way I see it, we can
take a chance...

1176
01:00:05,806 --> 01:00:07,741
or we can choke to
death in this pit...

1177
01:00:07,741 --> 01:00:09,075
Good marines laid
down their lives

1178
01:00:09,075 --> 01:00:10,243
for the people
trapped up there,

1179
01:00:10,243 --> 01:00:11,077
and I'll be damned if I'm gonna

1180
01:00:11,077 --> 01:00:13,680
let their sacrifice
be for nothing!

1181
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,382
If I go out, I'm going out
fighting for their memory...

1182
01:00:16,382 --> 01:00:19,986
Anybody here feels the same way,
you're welcome to join me.

1183
01:00:25,759 --> 01:00:28,028
Essex, you in?

1184
01:00:28,028 --> 01:00:29,663
[Essex] Hm.

1185
01:00:32,432 --> 01:00:34,234
[Essex] Well, I suppose
the fumes these tanks

1186
01:00:34,234 --> 01:00:36,603
are spewing out would
give us some cover...

1187
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:43,810
This swill tastes
of varren dung!

1188
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:46,112
My ship's cannon is
still operational...

1189
01:00:46,112 --> 01:00:49,950
If we get close enough,
we can blast our way inside.

1190
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:52,385
Then it's just a matter
of reaching the others...

1191
01:00:52,385 --> 01:00:54,254
And once we
administer the antidote,

1192
01:00:54,254 --> 01:00:56,356
maybe then they
can join the fight.

1193
01:00:56,356 --> 01:00:58,825
[Milque sighs]

1194
01:00:58,825 --> 01:01:00,861
Give me that damn thing...

1195
01:01:00,861 --> 01:01:03,797
But I'm still calling
this a suicide mission.

1196
01:01:05,732 --> 01:01:08,168
I'll need more than a
drink to change my mind.

1197
01:01:08,168 --> 01:01:11,772
Look, Milque... You've been
right about everything so far...

1198
01:01:11,772 --> 01:01:15,341
But you gotta be wrong sometime,
and I'd say you're about due.

1199
01:02:20,406 --> 01:02:22,509
Whoa, man...
That's harsh drivin'!

1200
01:02:22,509 --> 01:02:25,378
[Brood] We're in, aren't we?

1201
01:02:25,378 --> 01:02:28,281
[Messner] You say that
like it's a good thing.

1202
01:02:31,451 --> 01:02:33,219
[Milque] Look at all of 'em...

1203
01:02:33,219 --> 01:02:34,888
I guess we're the only
ones who made it

1204
01:02:34,888 --> 01:02:37,023
outta the colony... Lucky, huh?

1205
01:02:37,023 --> 01:02:39,793
Yeah, tell that to
Kamille and Nicky.

1206
01:02:39,793 --> 01:02:43,096
What do they want with
all these humans, anyway?

1207
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:46,066
Ah, I hate bugs
on my windshield.

1208
01:02:55,008 --> 01:02:57,844
We gotta stop this ship;
head for the drive core!

1209
01:02:57,844 --> 01:02:59,412
Let's try a short cut.

1210
01:02:59,412 --> 01:03:02,348
Wait‐‐do you even know
where you're going?!

1211
01:03:02,348 --> 01:03:07,487
[Brood] No, I just want to smash
a few more walls! Hang on!

1212
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,362
[Vega] Here! This is it!

1213
01:03:20,266 --> 01:03:23,203
[Vega] Essex, Milque‐‐
port side! Let's go!

1214
01:03:26,439 --> 01:03:29,876
[Essex] Yeah...! Come on!
Who wants some?!

1215
01:03:29,876 --> 01:03:33,880
[Vega grunts]

1216
01:03:36,416 --> 01:03:40,420
[Essex] Here...! You like that?!
Payback's a bitch, huh?!

1217
01:03:43,456 --> 01:03:45,091
[Milque] Behind us!

1218
01:03:48,529 --> 01:03:50,163
[Treeya] Vega!

1219
01:03:51,431 --> 01:03:53,433
[Vega] Thanks... Watch it!

1220
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:59,072
Nice shooting...
I think you're a natural.

1221
01:03:59,072 --> 01:04:00,206
Thanks.

1222
01:04:00,206 --> 01:04:02,408
[Vega] Brood! Take
out that drive core!

1223
01:04:02,408 --> 01:04:03,343
On it.

1224
01:04:03,343 --> 01:04:05,145
[Messner] Sorry, I
can't let you do that.

1225
01:04:05,145 --> 01:04:06,580
[Brood grunts]

1226
01:04:08,148 --> 01:04:10,517
Buh‐bye...

1227
01:04:10,517 --> 01:04:12,619
[Essex struggles]

1228
01:04:12,619 --> 01:04:14,254
Dammit...!

1229
01:04:33,574 --> 01:04:35,341
[Messner] Woo!
Rise and shine, Doc!

1230
01:04:35,341 --> 01:04:38,679
This is the moment you
don't want to miss!

1231
01:04:38,679 --> 01:04:39,780
From the sound of things,

1232
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:43,283
your colony's just been
reduced to a pile of ashes.

1233
01:04:44,918 --> 01:04:46,687
[Messner] You made
quite a mess down there,

1234
01:04:46,687 --> 01:04:49,322
and Collectors aren't
too big on evidence.

1235
01:04:49,322 --> 01:04:52,526
But hey, you fought the
good fight‐‐right, Doc?

1236
01:04:52,526 --> 01:04:54,628
These guys usually don't
face much resistance.

1237
01:04:54,628 --> 01:04:55,762
Don't beat yourself up.

1238
01:04:55,762 --> 01:04:58,565
You've been working for them...
How could you do this?

1239
01:04:58,565 --> 01:05:01,434
[Messner] I've saved more
than I've sacrificed, Doctor.

1240
01:05:01,434 --> 01:05:02,569
If you weren't so hung up

1241
01:05:02,569 --> 01:05:04,971
on petty details,
you'd realize that.

1242
01:05:04,971 --> 01:05:06,472
[Treeya] How dare you...?!

1243
01:05:06,472 --> 01:05:09,209
Those are innocent lives
you destroyed, Messner!

1244
01:05:09,209 --> 01:05:11,578
They were your own people!

1245
01:05:11,578 --> 01:05:13,179
Look, everything
I've done has been

1246
01:05:13,179 --> 01:05:15,348
in pursuit of Cerberus goals...

1247
01:05:15,348 --> 01:05:17,283
After we figured out the
Collectors were the ones

1248
01:05:17,283 --> 01:05:18,985
making off with the colonists,

1249
01:05:18,985 --> 01:05:21,988
I got in touch, I lured
them out with a colony

1250
01:05:21,988 --> 01:05:24,925
that would be easy
pickings, and voila.

1251
01:05:26,192 --> 01:05:28,294
[Treeya] That artifact
among the ruins...

1252
01:05:28,294 --> 01:05:31,264
The one that jammed our
long‐range communications...

1253
01:05:31,264 --> 01:05:35,401
You put that there!
You were summoning them!

1254
01:05:35,401 --> 01:05:38,271
But to what end?
What was Cerberus thinking?!

1255
01:05:38,271 --> 01:05:41,642
[Messner] Frankly, that we might
learn something‐‐and we have.

1256
01:05:41,642 --> 01:05:42,643
Guilt‐trip me all you want,

1257
01:05:42,643 --> 01:05:45,278
I've gathered data on
their ships and weapons,

1258
01:05:45,278 --> 01:05:47,213
ascertained their strengths
and weaknesses‐‐

1259
01:05:47,213 --> 01:05:50,083
hell, I even know
about their home base,

1260
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:52,118
out beyond Omega Four relay...

1261
01:05:52,118 --> 01:05:53,720
Just think of all
the knowledge!

1262
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:56,222
Don't tell me that
doesn't excite you!

1263
01:05:56,222 --> 01:05:59,626
All it does is sicken me!
None of that is worth the cost!

1264
01:05:59,626 --> 01:06:03,664
Gotta wonder, though...
Why are they juicing us...?

1265
01:06:03,664 --> 01:06:06,166
They're not using that
DNA slurry for food,

1266
01:06:06,166 --> 01:06:08,034
I can tell you that much.

1267
01:06:11,337 --> 01:06:12,506
Tell you what...
I'm gonna let you

1268
01:06:12,506 --> 01:06:15,041
put that brain of
yours to use, Doc.

1269
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:16,476
I've got a puzzle
that needs solving,

1270
01:06:16,476 --> 01:06:18,512
and you're just the
asari for the job...

1271
01:06:18,512 --> 01:06:19,513
Figure it out fast enough,

1272
01:06:19,513 --> 01:06:23,016
and you might be able to
save some colonists, hm?

1273
01:06:23,016 --> 01:06:25,118
And after I do... What then?

1274
01:06:25,118 --> 01:06:27,420
You paralyze me
and pack me away?

1275
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:28,622
Hey, I'm just giving
you a chance

1276
01:06:28,622 --> 01:06:31,057
to do something
important with your life!

1277
01:06:31,057 --> 01:06:33,694
And as you're about to
find out... I'm not asking.

1278
01:06:33,694 --> 01:06:35,729
[Treeya struggles]

1279
01:06:35,729 --> 01:06:38,765
[Treeya] No! Let go of me!

1280
01:06:38,765 --> 01:06:44,204
You won't get away
with this! Vega! Vega!

1281
01:06:51,778 --> 01:06:58,318
[Vega snarls, grunts]

1282
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:00,486
[Vega] Oye! Feo!

1283
01:07:00,486 --> 01:07:02,122
[Vega grunts]

1284
01:07:02,122 --> 01:07:04,124
[Vega pants]

1285
01:07:04,124 --> 01:07:06,092
[Vega yells]

1286
01:07:08,729 --> 01:07:11,632
[Vega] Sweet dreams, asshole.

1287
01:07:11,632 --> 01:07:14,334
[unidentified groaning]

1288
01:07:14,334 --> 01:07:17,303
[Vega] Brood...? Brood!

1289
01:07:17,303 --> 01:07:19,573
[Brood struggles] Vega...?

1290
01:07:19,573 --> 01:07:20,574
[Vega] I'm here.

1291
01:07:20,574 --> 01:07:23,443
Here... Take my power cell.
You'll need it...

1292
01:07:23,443 --> 01:07:24,444
[Brood coughs]

1293
01:07:24,444 --> 01:07:26,713
And what about you, big man?

1294
01:07:26,713 --> 01:07:29,616
I'm finished. But maybe
you can still use it

1295
01:07:29,616 --> 01:07:31,417
to fight your way out.

1296
01:07:31,417 --> 01:07:35,188
You freed me from that cage,
Vega, and gave me the chance

1297
01:07:35,188 --> 01:07:38,725
to die with honor in battle,
the way a krogan should...

1298
01:07:38,725 --> 01:07:43,564
For that... I owe you a
debt I can never repay...

1299
01:07:43,564 --> 01:07:46,066
[Brood exhales]

1300
01:07:47,768 --> 01:07:50,571
Vaya con Dios, hermano.

1301
01:07:55,108 --> 01:07:58,679
[Essex] So‐‐no
biotics... no guns...

1302
01:07:58,679 --> 01:08:01,748
[Essex sighs] All I've got is my
knife and a couple of grenades.

1303
01:08:01,748 --> 01:08:05,185
Same here. We're pretty
much dead in the water, huh?

1304
01:08:05,185 --> 01:08:08,421
Not quite. Brood gave me a
power cell for you, Essex...

1305
01:08:08,421 --> 01:08:11,625
Better yet... We've still
got the antidote, too.

1306
01:08:11,625 --> 01:08:13,627
[Milque] Wait‐‐but
we never took it.

1307
01:08:13,627 --> 01:08:16,296
So why didn't we stay
paralyzed like the others?

1308
01:08:16,296 --> 01:08:18,398
[Vega laughs] C'mon,
man... Why you think

1309
01:08:18,398 --> 01:08:20,567
our last drink
tasted like shit?

1310
01:08:20,567 --> 01:08:22,869
You mean you just spiked
it without telling us?!

1311
01:08:22,869 --> 01:08:25,606
Seemed like a pretty
smart move at the time.

1312
01:08:25,606 --> 01:08:27,908
Great... So what's our move now?

1313
01:08:27,908 --> 01:08:31,211
Free the colonists...
and get the hell out.

1314
01:08:31,211 --> 01:08:32,312
[Essex] Hm.

1315
01:08:32,312 --> 01:08:36,216
You, uh... really think it's
going to be that easy?

1316
01:08:36,216 --> 01:08:38,351
No, no, but I think we
can get the Collectors'

1317
01:08:38,351 --> 01:08:40,587
processing system to
do most of the work.

1318
01:08:40,587 --> 01:08:42,789
And how we gonna do that?!

1319
01:08:42,789 --> 01:08:45,659
They run the pods through here
on this conveyor line, right?

1320
01:08:45,659 --> 01:08:48,361
So what do you wanna
bet's on the other end?

1321
01:08:48,361 --> 01:08:50,864
The holding area we
saw when we flew in...!

1322
01:08:50,864 --> 01:08:53,667
[Vega] Right. So I'll rig
the antidote to disperse

1323
01:08:53,667 --> 01:08:56,436
and send the pod
back down the line.

1324
01:08:56,436 --> 01:08:59,272
You guys get started
on the people in here.

1325
01:08:59,272 --> 01:09:03,443
[Milque coughs] Smells even
worse than it tastes!

1326
01:09:03,443 --> 01:09:05,378
[Vega] Here we go...

1327
01:09:05,378 --> 01:09:08,181
Pod's away. Cross your fingers.

1328
01:09:08,181 --> 01:09:10,684
[Milque] Hey, Vega... So once
we wake everyone up...

1329
01:09:10,684 --> 01:09:13,520
We're already off planet...
How do we get off this ship?

1330
01:09:14,855 --> 01:09:16,523
[Vega] April...

1331
01:09:18,725 --> 01:09:21,261
Earth to Vega‐‐
you listening, man?!

1332
01:09:21,261 --> 01:09:23,396
[Vega] I hear you,
Milque. Give me a sec...

1333
01:09:23,396 --> 01:09:24,798
I just found April.

1334
01:09:24,798 --> 01:09:26,266
[Milque] Tch...

1335
01:09:26,266 --> 01:09:28,569
[Vega] Hey, soldier,
you're gonna be alright.

1336
01:09:30,571 --> 01:09:33,473
Just one more thing I need
to do and then I'll be back.

1337
01:09:33,473 --> 01:09:36,710
Alright! Milque! Essex!
Time to move‐‐let's go!

1338
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:39,312
We need to get our
hands on Messner.

1339
01:09:41,281 --> 01:09:43,249
This is Prothean
technology, right?

1340
01:09:43,249 --> 01:09:45,719
Some kind of telepathic
data repository?

1341
01:09:45,719 --> 01:09:48,321
I don't know what it's
doing on a Collector ship,

1342
01:09:48,321 --> 01:09:49,956
but I want to find out.

1343
01:09:49,956 --> 01:09:52,526
I wouldn't have dragged you down
here except that, well, you see,

1344
01:09:52,526 --> 01:09:55,962
it doesn't seem to interact with
human minds all that well...

1345
01:09:55,962 --> 01:09:58,699
I threw some "volunteers"
at it, just to be safe,

1346
01:09:58,699 --> 01:10:01,668
and it fried their
cerebral cortices.

1347
01:10:01,668 --> 01:10:06,006
But Doc, you're a whole
different breed of guinea pig...

1348
01:10:06,006 --> 01:10:08,609
Yeah... You'll do it willingly.

1349
01:10:08,609 --> 01:10:10,977
'Cause maybe it'll tell you what
happened to your Protheans,

1350
01:10:10,977 --> 01:10:14,715
and maybe that information
helps you save some lives.

1351
01:10:20,253 --> 01:10:22,723
[Messner] C'mon.
You know you wanna.

1352
01:10:28,895 --> 01:10:30,864
[Treeya shivers]

1353
01:10:30,864 --> 01:10:32,566
[Treeya gasps]

1354
01:10:42,676 --> 01:10:45,779
[Reaper] You will submit.

1355
01:10:50,751 --> 01:10:53,754
[Reaper] You will ascend.

1356
01:10:59,459 --> 01:11:02,295
[Reaper] And you will serve.

1357
01:11:03,564 --> 01:11:04,865
What'd you see?!

1358
01:11:04,865 --> 01:11:08,001
Liara T'Soni... She
was right all along

1359
01:11:08,001 --> 01:11:10,370
about the fate of
the Protheans.

1360
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:12,906
Fifty thousand years ago,
the Reapers wiped them out.

1361
01:11:12,906 --> 01:11:15,408
Why do the Collectors
have this thing?

1362
01:11:15,408 --> 01:11:17,644
[Treeya sighs]

1363
01:11:17,644 --> 01:11:18,879
They are the Protheans...

1364
01:11:18,879 --> 01:11:21,515
remade by the Reapers
to serve them.

1365
01:11:21,515 --> 01:11:24,718
I need to know why Collectors
are taking human colonies!

1366
01:11:24,718 --> 01:11:25,652
Ask it yourself!

1367
01:11:25,652 --> 01:11:27,654
Once I get this last
piece of the puzzle,

1368
01:11:27,654 --> 01:11:31,091
I'll know all their secrets!
I will own them!

1369
01:11:31,091 --> 01:11:32,058
‐‐Do it again!
‐‐[Treeya] No!

1370
01:11:32,058 --> 01:11:34,460
[Messner] And this time,
tell me everything!

1371
01:11:51,845 --> 01:11:55,015
They're building
Reapers... out of...

1372
01:11:56,049 --> 01:11:57,654
... our DNA.

1373
01:12:01,054 --> 01:12:04,525
Let me get this straight.
We swoop in, kick Messner's ass,

1374
01:12:04,525 --> 01:12:06,627
grab Treeya, and bolt‐‐
that's the plan?

1375
01:12:06,627 --> 01:12:09,095
And one more thing: the intel
Messner has on the Collectors

1376
01:12:09,095 --> 01:12:11,898
will help Alliance Command
protect hundreds of colonies‐‐

1377
01:12:11,898 --> 01:12:13,867
thousands, maybe
millions of lives.

1378
01:12:13,867 --> 01:12:15,602
We bring it back,
whatever it takes.

1379
01:12:15,602 --> 01:12:17,704
Takin' a page from
Shepard's book, huh?

1380
01:12:17,704 --> 01:12:19,506
Save the girl, save the galaxy,

1381
01:12:19,506 --> 01:12:21,875
go home heroes.
That about right?

1382
01:12:21,875 --> 01:12:23,409
Maybe... But right now,

1383
01:12:23,409 --> 01:12:25,612
I'll settle for just
getting us all home.

1384
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:28,882
I've done what you asked,
now let me go, this instant‐‐

1385
01:12:28,882 --> 01:12:30,717
Ah, shut up.

1386
01:12:30,717 --> 01:12:32,152
[Messner] Hah!

1387
01:12:32,152 --> 01:12:37,824
It recorded! Yes! Now I
have everything I need!

1388
01:12:37,824 --> 01:12:39,059
[Treeya] Take your hands off me!

1389
01:12:39,059 --> 01:12:41,394
[Messner] I'm on your side!

1390
01:12:41,394 --> 01:12:42,729
[Essex] Why aren't
they attacking?

1391
01:12:42,729 --> 01:12:44,898
It's like they're not
even looking for us.

1392
01:12:44,898 --> 01:12:46,733
[Milque] Far as they know,
we're already juiced.

1393
01:12:46,733 --> 01:12:49,102
Probably never had
anyone escape before.

1394
01:12:49,102 --> 01:12:50,503
[Essex] That'll
change in a hurry

1395
01:12:50,503 --> 01:12:52,539
once the all colonists
start waking up.

1396
01:12:52,539 --> 01:12:54,074
We need to get 'em outta here.

1397
01:12:54,074 --> 01:12:57,611
Yeah, and I think we
might just be in luck.

1398
01:12:57,611 --> 01:12:59,780
Say, Milque. You're up.

1399
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:00,981
I am?! For what?!

1400
01:13:00,981 --> 01:13:04,017
Remind me... You started in
the pilot's program, right?

1401
01:13:04,017 --> 01:13:06,419
Think I remember
hearing that once.

1402
01:13:06,419 --> 01:13:10,791
Yeahhh...? And I got kicked out,
'cause I couldn't fly for shit.

1403
01:13:10,791 --> 01:13:12,626
What're y‐‐oh, fuck that!

1404
01:13:12,626 --> 01:13:13,894
Guess you're just
gonna have to learn

1405
01:13:13,894 --> 01:13:16,196
in a hurry, aren't ya? Hop on.

1406
01:13:16,196 --> 01:13:18,599
[Vega] We've still got a fix
on Treeya's omni‐tool.

1407
01:13:18,599 --> 01:13:20,500
That's where me and
Essex are headed.

1408
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:23,837
You get this bucket in the air
and come pick us up. Got it?

1409
01:13:23,837 --> 01:13:26,840
Okay, but don't
complain if I'm late!

1410
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:29,142
[Vega] Just be there.

1411
01:13:29,142 --> 01:13:32,445
Sure, guys... but if I
actually pull this off,

1412
01:13:32,445 --> 01:13:35,716
this time, free drinks for life
are not even gonna cover it...

1413
01:13:36,683 --> 01:13:40,554
[VI Translator] Your usefulness
has decreased to zero, human.

1414
01:13:40,554 --> 01:13:42,488
You have allowed
Alliance soldiers

1415
01:13:42,488 --> 01:13:45,025
to threaten our mandate.

1416
01:13:45,025 --> 01:13:46,226
Hey, without me, those soldiers

1417
01:13:46,226 --> 01:13:47,894
would've taken out
your drive core.

1418
01:13:47,894 --> 01:13:49,563
How 'bout a little appreciation?

1419
01:13:49,563 --> 01:13:53,534
[VI Translator] Negative.
It is time for your ascension.

1420
01:13:53,534 --> 01:13:57,904
[Messner] What...?
No way! Don't even try it!

1421
01:13:57,904 --> 01:14:01,141
Anything happens to me,
this data goes to the Alliance!

1422
01:14:01,141 --> 01:14:02,242
[Messner and Treeya pant]

1423
01:14:02,242 --> 01:14:05,478
[Messner] I mean it!
I'll give 'em all your secrets!

1424
01:14:05,478 --> 01:14:07,948
[VI Translator] Your threats
are meaningless, human.

1425
01:14:07,948 --> 01:14:10,851
You really want to take
that chance, do you?

1426
01:14:10,851 --> 01:14:13,486
You think you had trouble
with a few Marines?

1427
01:14:13,486 --> 01:14:15,656
What're you gonna do when
you find the entire fleet

1428
01:14:15,656 --> 01:14:18,124
parked outside the
Omega 4 relay? Huh?!

1429
01:14:18,124 --> 01:14:19,960
Would that "threaten
your mandate"?!

1430
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:22,996
Now, now, what you say we
just be reasonable here...

1431
01:14:22,996 --> 01:14:25,732
[VI Translator] Incompetence
cannot be tolerated.

1432
01:14:25,732 --> 01:14:27,000
In addition to soldiers,

1433
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,103
you have allowed this
asari aboard our ship.

1434
01:14:30,103 --> 01:14:32,639
She will taint our
human material.

1435
01:14:32,639 --> 01:14:35,776
Don't like the blue chick?
Fine! I'll throw 'er out for ya!

1436
01:14:35,776 --> 01:14:37,644
Don't touch me, Messner...

1437
01:14:37,644 --> 01:14:39,580
[Treeya struggles]

1438
01:14:43,584 --> 01:14:46,987
No! Let me out!

1439
01:14:46,987 --> 01:14:48,088
[Messner gasps]

1440
01:14:48,088 --> 01:14:50,657
You bitch! Give me that!

1441
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:53,594
[Messner grunts]

1442
01:14:53,594 --> 01:14:55,028
[Treeya gasps]

1443
01:14:56,196 --> 01:14:58,532
[Vega grunts]

1444
01:14:58,532 --> 01:14:59,933
[Vega] Treeya!

1445
01:14:59,933 --> 01:15:01,668
[VI Translator] Eject the asari!

1446
01:15:04,137 --> 01:15:05,772
[Treeya screams]

1447
01:15:11,878 --> 01:15:13,980
[Vega] Treeya!

1448
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:15,982
No!

1449
01:15:15,982 --> 01:15:17,918
Go on, man; never
keep a lady waiting.

1450
01:15:17,918 --> 01:15:19,820
I'll take care of these bugs.

1451
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:21,655
[Vega] Thanks, Essex.

1452
01:15:21,655 --> 01:15:24,925
You watch yourself,
Marine. Hoo‐rah!

1453
01:15:24,925 --> 01:15:29,730
[Essex grunts]

1454
01:15:31,832 --> 01:15:33,867
[Essex] Hngaah!

1455
01:15:34,835 --> 01:15:36,603
See ya!

1456
01:15:39,573 --> 01:15:41,842
[Essex] You're next, ugly!

1457
01:15:41,842 --> 01:15:44,077
[Treeya] Vega!!

1458
01:15:44,077 --> 01:15:46,947
[Vega growls] Hang on!

1459
01:15:49,883 --> 01:15:52,285
[Treeya screams]

1460
01:15:53,587 --> 01:15:54,721
[Vega growls]

1461
01:15:54,721 --> 01:15:57,223
Nooo!!

1462
01:15:57,223 --> 01:15:59,159
[Vega grunts]

1463
01:16:01,361 --> 01:16:03,997
So you took the antidote
when I wasn't lookin', eh?

1464
01:16:03,997 --> 01:16:09,803
[Vega groans]

1465
01:16:09,803 --> 01:16:12,673
I guess you think you're
pretty clever, don'tcha...

1466
01:16:12,673 --> 01:16:14,207
you stupid grunt?!

1467
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:16,877
[Messner and Vega grunt]

1468
01:16:16,877 --> 01:16:19,312
[Messner] How's that
workin' out for ya...?!

1469
01:16:19,312 --> 01:16:23,216
[Vega groans]

1470
01:16:23,216 --> 01:16:26,186
[Messner and Vega pant]

1471
01:16:27,921 --> 01:16:29,956
Adios...

1472
01:16:29,956 --> 01:16:31,592
[Vega yells]

1473
01:16:33,193 --> 01:16:34,895
[Messner shudders]

1474
01:16:34,895 --> 01:16:39,099
We're not done. You've still
got something I need.

1475
01:16:39,099 --> 01:16:41,367
Try not to die
before I get back.

1476
01:16:41,367 --> 01:16:43,069
[Messner shudders]

1477
01:16:49,075 --> 01:16:52,813
Come in! Treeya!
Treeya, do you copy?!

1478
01:16:52,813 --> 01:16:54,815
[Treeya] Yes, Vega.
I can hear you.

1479
01:16:54,815 --> 01:16:56,917
[Vega] Any idea where you are?!

1480
01:16:56,917 --> 01:17:00,386
I've started to descend...
into the atmosphere...

1481
01:17:00,386 --> 01:17:03,323
But so has the ship‐‐
you don't have much time!

1482
01:17:03,323 --> 01:17:04,958
[Vega] I'm coming, Treeya!

1483
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:10,664
[Essex grunts]

1484
01:17:14,034 --> 01:17:15,669
[Essex] Heads up, asshole!

1485
01:17:16,436 --> 01:17:18,071
[Essex groans]

1486
01:17:19,973 --> 01:17:21,708
Still with me, Essex?!

1487
01:17:23,143 --> 01:17:26,112
Aw, hell yeah! As long
as they keep on comin',

1488
01:17:26,112 --> 01:17:28,214
I'll just keep
knockin' 'em down!

1489
01:17:31,384 --> 01:17:33,453
[Essex gasps]

1490
01:17:33,453 --> 01:17:34,955
Essex!

1491
01:17:34,955 --> 01:17:36,389
[Vega roars]

1492
01:17:36,389 --> 01:17:41,094
[Essex gurgles]

1493
01:17:42,462 --> 01:17:44,330
[Essex coughs]

1494
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:48,134
[Vega growls, grunts]

1495
01:17:48,134 --> 01:17:50,236
[Essex groans]

1496
01:17:50,236 --> 01:17:55,008
Collect this... you bitch!

1497
01:17:55,008 --> 01:18:00,881
[Essex struggles, yells]

1498
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:09,455
[Vega] Essex!!

1499
01:18:09,455 --> 01:18:11,157
Dammit...

1500
01:18:12,258 --> 01:18:13,459
[Vega] C'mere!

1501
01:18:13,459 --> 01:18:15,929
[Messner groans]

1502
01:18:15,929 --> 01:18:17,864
[Vega grunts]

1503
01:18:17,864 --> 01:18:19,766
Where's the data?!

1504
01:18:19,766 --> 01:18:22,268
[Messner shudders]

1505
01:18:29,843 --> 01:18:31,978
[Vega yells]

1506
01:18:35,048 --> 01:18:42,388
[Vega grunts, struggles]

1507
01:18:46,026 --> 01:18:48,194
[Vega yells]

1508
01:18:49,362 --> 01:18:55,769
[Vega roars, grunts]

1509
01:19:05,178 --> 01:19:06,947
[Vega] It's about
damn time, Milque!

1510
01:19:06,947 --> 01:19:08,949
Hey! Better late than never!

1511
01:19:08,949 --> 01:19:12,485
[indistinct chatter]

1512
01:19:12,485 --> 01:19:14,120
Mommy! We can move again!

1513
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:15,989
That's right, honey.
Now, I need you to be

1514
01:19:15,989 --> 01:19:18,358
a brave girl for me.
We're gonna be okay.

1515
01:19:18,358 --> 01:19:22,863
Yeah! Lieutenant James is
gonna save us. He promised...

1516
01:19:22,863 --> 01:19:25,866
But where is he?
He's here... right?

1517
01:19:25,866 --> 01:19:27,367
Don't worry, he
hasn't forgotten.

1518
01:19:27,367 --> 01:19:29,970
Vega'll be back soon,
I guarantee it.

1519
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:32,506
Yeah, I know that!
But he needs me,

1520
01:19:32,506 --> 01:19:33,574
I'm s'posed to be his lookout!

1521
01:19:33,574 --> 01:19:35,809
[Christine] April!

1522
01:19:35,809 --> 01:19:39,045
[Toni chuckles]
Brave kid you got there.

1523
01:19:43,083 --> 01:19:45,586
Come on! The data!
Where the hell is it?!

1524
01:19:45,586 --> 01:19:48,822
Listen... I can pay you
as much as you want;

1525
01:19:48,822 --> 01:19:50,256
just name your price...

1526
01:19:50,256 --> 01:19:51,858
Please, Vega... Help me.

1527
01:19:51,858 --> 01:19:53,359
You just can't leave
me here like th‐‐

1528
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:55,128
[Vega] You made your choice.

1529
01:19:56,997 --> 01:20:01,067
[Milque] Vega! We got more
drones inbound! Time to go! Now!

1530
01:20:01,067 --> 01:20:03,169
Not yet! I haven't found
Messner's data cuff!

1531
01:20:03,169 --> 01:20:05,071
[Treeya] He doesn't have it!

1532
01:20:06,372 --> 01:20:10,076
What? Treeya‐‐you have it?

1533
01:20:10,076 --> 01:20:11,612
Yes.

1534
01:20:11,612 --> 01:20:14,948
She's lying! Just...
take me with you!

1535
01:20:14,948 --> 01:20:19,285
It's yours! Anything! I don't
wanna die! Not like this!

1536
01:20:19,285 --> 01:20:22,488
No! Nooo‐‐!!

1537
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:26,259
[Vega grunts]
We're coming, Treeya!

1538
01:20:26,259 --> 01:20:29,195
The Reapers were responsible
for the Prothean disappearance.

1539
01:20:29,195 --> 01:20:31,364
You have to warn the Council.

1540
01:20:31,364 --> 01:20:34,134
We will; that intel's going
straight to the Alliance!

1541
01:20:34,134 --> 01:20:35,468
We'll pick up the
colonists first,

1542
01:20:35,468 --> 01:20:36,703
then we're coming after you!

1543
01:20:36,703 --> 01:20:40,574
Milque! Track her position‐‐
don't lose her! And punch it!

1544
01:20:40,574 --> 01:20:41,808
Roger that.

1545
01:20:43,544 --> 01:20:47,280
[Treeya] There's no time, Vega.
You'll have to make a choice...

1546
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:51,251
And the loss of one is better
than the alternative...

1547
01:20:51,251 --> 01:20:56,523
One life... in exchange for
the lives of so many others...

1548
01:20:56,523 --> 01:20:59,926
I know you'd try to save
everyone if you could.

1549
01:20:59,926 --> 01:21:03,063
But circumstances have made
that impossible, I'm afraid.

1550
01:21:03,063 --> 01:21:04,965
It's not your fault.

1551
01:21:04,965 --> 01:21:07,467
I know you well enough
to know you'll make

1552
01:21:07,467 --> 01:21:10,937
the best choice...
and I understand.

1553
01:21:10,937 --> 01:21:12,372
[Vega] No!

1554
01:21:14,975 --> 01:21:17,978
[Toni] Vega! Come in,
Vega! Do you read?

1555
01:21:19,245 --> 01:21:22,482
We're taking fire here, Vega!
We need to evacuate, now!

1556
01:21:22,482 --> 01:21:25,652
[Vega] Captain. Lieutenant
Vega here. I copy.

1557
01:21:25,652 --> 01:21:26,753
I'm gonna try to
reach you, sir, but...

1558
01:21:26,753 --> 01:21:29,022
‐‐[Christine] April!
‐‐[April] Hey, is that James?!

1559
01:21:29,022 --> 01:21:31,457
Lieutenant James, can you
hear me? It's Private April!

1560
01:21:31,457 --> 01:21:36,029
We're still here! Mommy and
me are waiting for you!

1561
01:21:36,029 --> 01:21:37,297
Vega, what do we do, man?!

1562
01:21:37,297 --> 01:21:40,166
[Vega pants]

1563
01:21:40,166 --> 01:21:42,636
[Treeya] It's okay, Vega...

1564
01:21:42,636 --> 01:21:48,108
You can do what needs to
be done. I know you can.

1565
01:21:53,446 --> 01:21:55,982
[Vega and Milque grunt]

1566
01:21:55,982 --> 01:21:59,052
[Vega yells]

01:22:39,292 --> 01:22:41,361
We've analyzed
your report, Vega.

1569
01:22:41,361 --> 01:22:43,296
Now, is there anything
else you wish to add

1570
01:22:43,296 --> 01:22:47,367
to the official record before we
make our final determinations?

1571
01:22:47,367 --> 01:22:50,170
No, sir. It's all there.

1572
01:22:50,170 --> 01:22:52,138
We understand that
you found yourself

1573
01:22:52,138 --> 01:22:54,575
facing a very difficult
decision, Lieutenant...

1574
01:22:54,575 --> 01:22:56,743
and you chose to
rescue a single civilian

1575
01:22:56,743 --> 01:22:58,779
carrying intel on
these "Collectors,"

1576
01:22:58,779 --> 01:23:02,482
at the cost of hundreds
of colonist lives.

1577
01:23:02,482 --> 01:23:04,651
[David Anderson] We don't
envy you that position, son.

1578
01:23:04,651 --> 01:23:06,352
This intel will
not only help us

1579
01:23:06,352 --> 01:23:08,421
stop the Collectors
in the short term...

1580
01:23:08,421 --> 01:23:11,792
but in the long term...
it will aid humanity

1581
01:23:11,792 --> 01:23:15,061
with ship and
weapons technology.

1582
01:23:15,061 --> 01:23:17,263
You also proved the
effectiveness of an antidote

1583
01:23:17,263 --> 01:23:20,734
that will protect our people
against the Collector swarms.

1584
01:23:20,734 --> 01:23:23,169
In short, you're a hero.

1585
01:23:23,169 --> 01:23:25,338
And for exemplary
service to the Alliance,

1586
01:23:25,338 --> 01:23:28,041
you're being commended.

1587
01:23:28,041 --> 01:23:32,579
Congratulations,
Lieutenant Commander Vega.

1588
01:23:32,579 --> 01:23:34,347
[Milque laughs]

1589
01:23:34,347 --> 01:23:35,782
Congrats!

1590
01:23:37,518 --> 01:23:39,319
Your new orders, son.

1591
01:23:39,319 --> 01:23:42,422
Perhaps you'll follow in
Shepard's footsteps after all.

1592
01:23:42,422 --> 01:23:44,090
You might even work together.

1593
01:23:44,090 --> 01:23:45,458
Sir...?

1594
01:23:45,458 --> 01:23:48,061
Turns out the reports of
Shepard's death were...

1595
01:23:48,061 --> 01:23:51,064
well, let's just
say "premature."

1596
01:23:51,064 --> 01:23:55,368
So, what'd they give you?
Thank you! Let's see it.

1597
01:23:55,368 --> 01:23:59,339
Oh, hot damn! They want you
to put in for the N7 program!

1598
01:23:59,339 --> 01:24:01,174
You'll be with the
best of the best!

1599
01:24:01,174 --> 01:24:03,677
Right up there with
Commander Shepard...

1600
01:24:03,677 --> 01:24:06,146
Just sayin... y'know...

1601
01:24:06,146 --> 01:24:07,748
[Vega sighs]

1602
01:24:07,748 --> 01:24:11,417
Uh... Look, I don't know if
this means anything to you...

1603
01:24:11,417 --> 01:24:12,686
But I think you're
a hell of a leader,

1604
01:24:12,686 --> 01:24:16,489
and I'd still follow you into
battle anytime, anywhere, sir.

1605
01:24:16,489 --> 01:24:18,825
Thanks, but I don't
deserve that.

1606
01:24:19,793 --> 01:24:22,262
It's a chance to
start over, isn't it?

1607
01:24:22,262 --> 01:24:23,496
To move forward...

1608
01:24:23,496 --> 01:24:26,432
To live the hero's life
you've always wanted...

1609
01:24:27,834 --> 01:24:30,303
I don't know what I
want anymore, Treeya...

1610
01:24:30,303 --> 01:24:32,272
but I know I'm no hero.

1611
01:25:18,184 --> 01:25:21,354
Whoa, this looks even worse
than I imagined it would...

1612
01:25:22,789 --> 01:25:25,526
[Vega groans]

1613
01:25:25,526 --> 01:25:27,427
[Vega] That's April's...

1614
01:25:29,195 --> 01:25:30,831
[Vega moans, Treeya gasps]

1615
01:25:30,831 --> 01:25:31,898
[April's voice]
You're gonna protect us

1616
01:25:31,898 --> 01:25:33,700
if the bad guys come back!

1617
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:36,502
Is it true? Are you gonna?

1618
01:25:36,502 --> 01:25:40,707
[Vega groans, Treeya sobs]

1619
01:25:40,707 --> 01:25:42,442
How could we let this...?

1620
01:25:42,442 --> 01:25:44,310
[Treeya sobs]

1621
01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:53,453
[Vega grunts, pants]

1622
01:25:56,590 --> 01:25:59,325
[Vega pants]

1623
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:04,430
[Treeya sobs]

1624
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:05,298
[Vega pants]

1625
01:26:05,298 --> 01:26:08,535
Hey! Watch it! What's
wrong with you?!

1626
01:26:08,535 --> 01:26:09,736
[Vega pants]

1627
01:26:09,736 --> 01:26:13,339
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...!

1628
01:26:13,339 --> 01:26:15,676
[Hackett's voice] For exemplary
service to the Alliance,

1629
01:26:15,676 --> 01:26:18,344
you're being commended...
You're a hero...

1630
01:26:18,344 --> 01:26:19,580
[Vega screams]

1631
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:21,447
[Anderson's voice] In the long
term... it will aid humanity

1632
01:26:21,447 --> 01:26:22,949
with ship and weapons
technology...

1633
01:26:22,949 --> 01:26:25,686
[Hackett's voice] ...proved the
effectiveness of an antidote...

1634
01:26:25,686 --> 01:26:26,887
[Milque's voice] ...you're
a hell of a leader...

1635
01:26:26,887 --> 01:26:28,522
The best of the best!

1636
01:26:28,522 --> 01:26:29,590
[Treeya's voice]
I know you'd try

1637
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:31,391
to save everyone
if you could...

1638
01:26:31,391 --> 01:26:32,659
[April's voice] He promised!

1639
01:26:32,659 --> 01:26:33,894
[Christine's voice]
Close your eyes, baby!

1640
01:26:33,894 --> 01:26:35,495
[unidentified voice screaming]

1641
01:26:35,495 --> 01:26:38,532
‐‐[April's voice] Mommy!
‐‐[Treeya's voice] I know
you'll make the best choice.

1642
01:26:38,532 --> 01:26:39,332
[Tech's voice]
They're not comin'!

1643
01:26:39,332 --> 01:26:40,701
[April's voice]
We're still here!

1644
01:26:40,701 --> 01:26:43,269
[Toni's voice] We need
to evacuate, now!

1645
01:26:43,269 --> 01:26:44,738
Vega, what do we do, man?!

1646
01:26:44,738 --> 01:26:47,273
[Vega and Milque grunt]

1647
01:26:47,273 --> 01:26:48,775
[Vega yells]

1648
01:26:48,775 --> 01:26:51,011
What's happening? Where's James?

1649
01:26:51,011 --> 01:26:53,747
[indistinct yelling
and dialogue]

1650
01:26:53,747 --> 01:26:56,316
They're not comin'
for us... are they?

1651
01:26:56,316 --> 01:26:58,952
[Toni] Vega, it's now
or never, son.

1652
01:26:58,952 --> 01:27:00,020
[Vega shudders]

1653
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:00,821
[unidentified voice] Look out!

1654
01:27:00,821 --> 01:27:02,756
[scattered yelling
and screaming]

1655
01:27:02,756 --> 01:27:03,924
[April] Mommy?

1656
01:27:03,924 --> 01:27:06,993
Hush... It's okay,
baby... It's okay...

1657
01:27:06,993 --> 01:27:09,730
Just close your eyes, honey...
we're going home...

1658
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:10,564
[yelling and screaming
in background]

1659
01:27:10,564 --> 01:27:12,766
[yelling and
screaming over radio]

1660
01:27:15,736 --> 01:27:17,638
James said he'd come back...

1661
01:27:17,638 --> 01:27:20,674
He said he'd save us,
Mommy. He promised!

1662
01:27:20,674 --> 01:27:22,776
[April sobs]

1663
01:27:22,776 --> 01:27:24,778
[Toni] God have mercy...

1664
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:30,551
[Vega screams]

1665
01:27:44,430 --> 01:27:46,867
[Milque gasps] What
did you do, man?!

1666
01:27:49,703 --> 01:27:52,773
[Vega and Milque grunt, pant]

1667
01:27:52,773 --> 01:27:56,409
[Vega seethes]

1668
01:27:56,409 --> 01:27:59,445
Nooo!!

1669
01:28:00,413 --> 01:28:03,784
[Vega] I did this!
I made the choice!

1670
01:28:03,784 --> 01:28:06,553
I abandoned them to die!

1671
01:28:06,553 --> 01:28:14,494
[Vega yells, pants]

1672
01:28:14,494 --> 01:28:17,463
I didn't know how to
save you! I'm sorry!

1673
01:28:17,463 --> 01:28:20,867
I would've given
my life if I could!

1674
01:28:20,867 --> 01:28:23,870
There just wasn't enough time...

1675
01:28:28,742 --> 01:28:32,445
Ahem! This is Alliance
Marine... Private April!

1676
01:28:32,445 --> 01:28:35,749
Reporting for
duty, sir! Hoo‐rah!

1677
01:28:35,749 --> 01:28:40,353
[April giggles] It's too
big for me! Here.

1678
01:28:40,353 --> 01:28:46,860
[Vega grunts, pants]

1679
01:28:51,364 --> 01:28:52,866
[Vega gasps]

1680
01:29:06,613 --> 01:29:08,048
[Treeya] Vega...

1681
01:29:11,852 --> 01:29:15,556
Why... Why did you...
choose me...?

1682
01:29:15,556 --> 01:29:17,791
Because... at the
time, I thought

1683
01:29:17,791 --> 01:29:20,661
I was making the
best decision...

1684
01:29:20,661 --> 01:29:24,364
Now... I just don't know.

1685
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:28,969
[Vega] But I'm glad you're here.

1686
01:29:41,047 --> 01:29:43,416
[Vega] Maybe it's too
late to change things.

1687
01:29:43,416 --> 01:29:45,652
Maybe I can't bring 'em back.

1688
01:29:45,652 --> 01:29:47,821
But what I can do is
spend the rest of my life

1689
01:29:47,821 --> 01:29:50,724
trying to make it
count. For their sake.

1690
01:29:52,458 --> 01:29:57,030
Goodbye, Private April...
We'll never forget you.

1691
01:30:02,102 --> 01:30:04,705
[Vega] We'll never
forget any of you.

1692
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:16,082
[N7 Pilot] Coming in hot.
Prep for drop.

1693
01:30:21,087 --> 01:30:22,756
[Vega] For Kamille...

1694
01:30:24,825 --> 01:30:26,459
[Vega] Mason...

1695
01:30:28,629 --> 01:30:30,063
[Vega] For Nicky...

1696
01:30:32,566 --> 01:30:34,000
[Vega] Essex...

1697
01:30:36,102 --> 01:30:37,738
[Vega] Captain Toni...

1698
01:30:40,073 --> 01:30:41,975
[Vega] And for April...

1699
01:30:43,476 --> 01:30:47,080
[Vega] Today... I'm gonna
make all of you proud.

1700
01:30:50,150 --> 01:30:52,052
Go!

1701
01:30:52,052 --> 01:30:56,757
This is what we do, Marines!
Go, go, go, go, go!!
