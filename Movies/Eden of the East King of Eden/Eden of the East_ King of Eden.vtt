00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:02.194 position:27% line:83% align:start
Saki, thanks for
believing in me.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:03.596 position:13% line:89% align:start
Don't forget our travels.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.766 position:21% line:83% align:start
You can always find
me at our special place.

00:02:02.027 --> 00:02:03.662 position:13% line:89% align:start
Say, would it be all right

00:02:03.695 --> 00:02:05.530 position:24% line:83% align:start
if we pulled over
there for a second?

00:02:05.564 --> 00:02:06.366 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.134 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's Grand
Central Staion, right?

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:09.936 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, right. Sure.

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:12.705 position:24% line:83% align:start
Whatever you say,
lady. It's your fare.

00:02:15.242 --> 00:02:16.076 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ah, thanks.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.945 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've never seen it
in person before.

00:02:17.978 --> 00:02:19.713 position:21% line:83% align:start
I just think it'd be
neat to get a picture.

00:02:19.747 --> 00:02:21.782 position:35% line:89% align:start
Tourists.

00:02:31.993 --> 00:02:34.330 position:7% line:89% align:start
There ya go. Fifty-five bucks.

00:02:34.363 --> 00:02:35.431 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, well, I uh...

00:02:35.464 --> 00:02:38.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
I really just wanted to
jump out and take a picture,

00:02:38.734 --> 00:02:39.635 position:16% line:89% align:start
but if that's not okay--

00:02:39.668 --> 00:02:42.671 position:21% line:83% align:start
Free country, lady.
I'll get your bags.

00:02:42.705 --> 00:02:44.874 position:24% line:83% align:start
Uh, wow, guess I'm
walking to the hotel...

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.586 position:41% line:89% align:start
Jeez.

00:03:03.328 --> 00:03:04.762 position:41% line:89% align:start
Shit!

00:03:05.864 --> 00:03:07.733 position:16% line:89% align:start
What the fuck is this?!

00:03:07.766 --> 00:03:12.137 position:27% line:83% align:start
One, two, three,
four, five, six-

00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:18.745 position:30% line:89% align:start
What's wrong?!

00:03:18.778 --> 00:03:19.946 position:30% line:89% align:start
Are you nuts?!

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:21.114 position:19% line:89% align:start
How stupid can you be,

00:03:21.147 --> 00:03:23.951 position:24% line:83% align:start
bringing crap like
this into my car? Huh?!

00:03:40.902 --> 00:03:43.973 position:35% line:89% align:start
Come back!

00:03:46.676 --> 00:03:48.978 position:24% line:89% align:start
Come back, oh, no.

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.181 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's a gun! Quick!

00:03:51.215 --> 00:03:52.983 position:13% line:89% align:start
Somebody call the police!

00:03:53.016 --> 00:03:54.251 position:16% line:89% align:start
Where did it come from?

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.262 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, I- uh-

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.006 position:13% line:89% align:start
Coming through, excuse me!

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.208 position:24% line:83% align:start
What am I supposed
to do with this thing?!

00:04:28.356 --> 00:04:29.923 position:30% line:89% align:start
What was that?

00:04:45.007 --> 00:04:47.009 position:7% line:89% align:start
What was this doing in my bag?

00:04:49.845 --> 00:04:51.314 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, great, what now?

00:04:51.347 --> 00:04:53.283 position:5% line:89% align:start
My passport, Takky's cell phone,

00:04:53.316 --> 00:04:56.286 position:21% line:83% align:start
my purse, they were
all still in the cab.

00:05:03.928 --> 00:05:05.462 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takizawa.

00:05:06.297 --> 00:05:08.899 position:33% line:83% align:start
Don't worry.
I'll figure this out.

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:11.369 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think I finally
know where to look.

00:07:45.972 --> 00:07:47.441 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, Saki!

00:08:18.409 --> 00:08:20.210 position:24% line:83% align:start
The police finally
finished interrogating me

00:08:20.244 --> 00:08:23.715 position:7% line:83% align:start
three days after the missiles
rained down all over Japan.

00:08:23.748 --> 00:08:26.418 position:10% line:83% align:start
I decided it was best to go
back to my sister's place,

00:08:26.451 --> 00:08:28.253 position:10% line:89% align:start
at least for the time being.

00:08:46.373 --> 00:08:49.276 position:30% line:83% align:start
Juiz speaking.
You have one message.

00:08:50.678 --> 00:08:53.247 position:27% line:83% align:start
Saki, thanks for
believing in me.

00:08:53.281 --> 00:08:54.549 position:13% line:89% align:start
Don't forget our travels.

00:08:54.582 --> 00:08:58.052 position:19% line:83% align:start
You can always find me
at our special place.

00:08:59.153 --> 00:09:01.055 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takizawa.

00:09:08.297 --> 00:09:10.400 position:24% line:83% align:start
I kept to myself,
hiding out at home

00:09:10.433 --> 00:09:12.402 position:19% line:83% align:start
until the uproar over
the missile incident

00:09:12.435 --> 00:09:14.204 position:24% line:89% align:start
began to die down.

00:09:14.237 --> 00:09:16.439 position:5% line:89% align:start
I had a lot of time on my hands.

00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:18.241 position:10% line:89% align:start
I spent most of it wondering

00:09:18.274 --> 00:09:20.544 position:19% line:83% align:start
about what could have
happened to Takizawa.

00:09:20.578 --> 00:09:23.347 position:21% line:83% align:start
But apparently Juiz
had been instructed

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.583 position:27% line:83% align:start
to erase any and
all record of his arrest

00:09:25.616 --> 00:09:27.586 position:19% line:89% align:start
from police computers.

00:09:27.619 --> 00:09:31.055 position:16% line:83% align:start
Takizawa had disappeared
from our world completely.

00:09:31.088 --> 00:09:34.025 position:24% line:83% align:start
He was impossible
to find or contact.

00:09:43.436 --> 00:09:47.406 position:16% line:83% align:start
You want to become king
of the country, but why?

00:09:53.547 --> 00:09:55.482 position:5% line:89% align:start
But a part of him existed still,

00:09:55.516 --> 00:09:59.219 position:10% line:83% align:start
in the pictures taken by the
people who were there that day.

00:09:59.253 --> 00:10:02.123 position:21% line:83% align:start
He hadn't faded from
everybody's memory.

00:10:02.156 --> 00:10:04.259 position:24% line:83% align:start
To some, he would
always be the savior

00:10:04.292 --> 00:10:07.128 position:19% line:83% align:start
who had rescued Japan
from the missiles.

00:10:20.243 --> 00:10:21.578 position:19% line:83% align:start
When all the pictures
were published

00:10:21.611 --> 00:10:24.314 position:10% line:83% align:start
online following the attack,
the mass media reported

00:10:24.347 --> 00:10:26.216 position:24% line:83% align:start
that Takizawa was
a central figure

00:10:26.249 --> 00:10:27.818 position:10% line:89% align:start
to the terror investigation.

00:10:27.852 --> 00:10:30.555 position:21% line:83% align:start
They began searching
for him everywhere.

00:10:33.291 --> 00:10:35.192 position:24% line:83% align:start
Meanwhile, because
it was the source

00:10:35.226 --> 00:10:38.095 position:16% line:83% align:start
of the Takizawa footage,
the Eden site was flooded

00:10:38.129 --> 00:10:40.265 position:30% line:83% align:start
with hits from
all over the world.

00:10:40.299 --> 00:10:46.639 position:10% line:83% align:start
Incredibly, Eden of the East
became an overnight sensation.

00:10:58.552 --> 00:11:00.721 position:5% line:83% align:start
The image of Takizawa directing
the missiles' take-down

00:11:00.754 --> 00:11:02.723 position:7% line:89% align:start
became a symbol of revolution.

00:11:02.756 --> 00:11:05.527 position:19% line:83% align:start
This picture, combined
with the slogan "Air King,"

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.861 position:10% line:89% align:start
drew more and more attention

00:11:06.895 --> 00:11:09.531 position:33% line:83% align:start
as the cause
gained wider support.

00:11:09.564 --> 00:11:11.666 position:16% line:89% align:start
After the missiles fell,

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.837 position:19% line:83% align:start
our country reached a
crucial turning point.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.272 position:16% line:83% align:start
There were miraculously
no casualties,

00:11:17.306 --> 00:11:18.774 position:5% line:89% align:start
but things on the domestic front

00:11:18.808 --> 00:11:22.846 position:16% line:83% align:start
were still destabilized
and stocks took a nosedive.

00:11:22.879 --> 00:11:26.349 position:19% line:83% align:start
After failing to stop
another "Careless Monday,"

00:11:26.383 --> 00:11:29.319 position:13% line:83% align:start
the entire administration
was forced to resign.

00:11:29.353 --> 00:11:32.289 position:21% line:83% align:start
The event earned the
name "Uncle Dissolution"

00:11:32.322 --> 00:11:34.659 position:7% line:83% align:start
in reference to Prime Minister
Eda's strange remark

00:11:34.692 --> 00:11:37.194 position:5% line:89% align:start
during the Administration Audit.

00:11:37.227 --> 00:11:38.329 position:7% line:89% align:start
All of these crazy events had

00:11:38.363 --> 00:11:41.834 position:7% line:83% align:start
a considerably negative effect
on the world economy.

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:44.369 position:24% line:83% align:start
As usual, the U.S.
maintained its policy

00:11:44.402 --> 00:11:47.373 position:24% line:83% align:start
of noninvolvement
and stayed out of it.

00:11:47.406 --> 00:11:49.508 position:7% line:89% align:start
Our global standing plummeted.

00:11:49.541 --> 00:11:51.310 position:13% line:89% align:start
Other nations satirized us

00:11:51.343 --> 00:11:54.514 position:21% line:83% align:start
as "the nation that
attempted suicide."

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:56.650 position:5% line:89% align:start
The missiles may have never hit,

00:11:56.683 --> 00:11:59.719 position:24% line:83% align:start
but the sad truth
of it is, in the end,

00:11:59.753 --> 00:12:03.523 position:16% line:83% align:start
Japan probably took more
damage than if they had.

00:12:03.557 --> 00:12:06.527 position:21% line:83% align:start
But there was still
the country's youth.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.596 position:21% line:83% align:start
They knew nothing of
Japan's economic boom

00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:10.932 position:24% line:83% align:start
or the subsequent
bursting of the bubble.

00:12:10.966 --> 00:12:12.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
This was the first
time they had seen

00:12:12.668 --> 00:12:15.337 position:16% line:83% align:start
their problems discussed
on the world stage.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.372 position:30% line:83% align:start
So even though
they were nervous,

00:12:17.406 --> 00:12:20.308 position:10% line:83% align:start
this instability represented
momentous opportunities

00:12:20.342 --> 00:12:21.944 position:27% line:89% align:start
for improvement.

00:12:21.978 --> 00:12:25.548 position:19% line:83% align:start
No one said so aloud,
but after that day,

00:12:25.581 --> 00:12:28.851 position:13% line:83% align:start
our vague sense of despair
became a kind of hopefulness,

00:12:28.885 --> 00:12:31.889 position:24% line:83% align:start
a feeling that we
could change the country.

00:12:31.922 --> 00:12:32.790 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, you guys!

00:12:32.823 --> 00:12:33.924 position:10% line:89% align:start
It was in this time shadowed

00:12:33.957 --> 00:12:35.759 position:13% line:89% align:start
by both fear and optimism,

00:12:35.793 --> 00:12:37.996 position:33% line:83% align:start
burdened by
unprecedented crises,

00:12:38.029 --> 00:12:40.999 position:7% line:83% align:start
that Eden of the East took the
plunge and went into business.

00:12:41.032 --> 00:12:44.903 position:13% line:83% align:start
I offered to help out too,
though I did feel a bit useless.

00:12:44.936 --> 00:12:47.739 position:21% line:83% align:start
Nice business card!
So professional!

00:12:47.772 --> 00:12:49.842 position:27% line:83% align:start
So you're "Sales
Division Three", huh?

00:12:49.875 --> 00:12:51.677 position:24% line:83% align:start
Just because it's
called the third division

00:12:51.711 --> 00:12:53.746 position:21% line:83% align:start
doesn't make me the
third-rate, you know.

00:12:56.849 --> 00:12:57.883 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kasuga!

00:12:57.917 --> 00:13:00.586 position:19% line:83% align:start
A hard worker like me
deserves respect, don't I?

00:13:00.619 --> 00:13:01.788 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't ask me.

00:13:01.822 --> 00:13:03.857 position:13% line:83% align:start
This hard worker's already
got a desk on the main floor.

00:13:51.943 --> 00:13:53.378 position:24% line:89% align:start
Come on now, Saki.

00:13:53.411 --> 00:13:55.380 position:13% line:89% align:start
How desperate can you get?

00:14:11.932 --> 00:14:13.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
We'll see you here
tomorrow, Saki!

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.736 position:24% line:83% align:start
It was six months
later--that summer--

00:14:15.769 --> 00:14:18.039 position:5% line:89% align:start
that things really began moving.

00:14:18.072 --> 00:14:20.608 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's when I finally got
the clue I'd been waiting for.

00:14:20.642 --> 00:14:21.743 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey.

00:14:21.776 --> 00:14:24.078 position:16% line:83% align:start
You just made a trip to
Washington in May, didn't you?

00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:25.580 position:27% line:83% align:start
I saw you bought
a second ticket,

00:14:25.613 --> 00:14:27.750 position:16% line:83% align:start
but what I don't get is
why you're going again.

00:14:27.783 --> 00:14:30.085 position:13% line:89% align:start
I didn't realize you knew.

00:14:35.524 --> 00:14:40.362 position:10% line:83% align:start
Why go? Don't you feel like
you belong here with us?

00:14:40.396 --> 00:14:43.900 position:13% line:89% align:start
No, that's not it, I just-

00:14:44.768 --> 00:14:46.938 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hirasawa, you're being an idiot.

00:14:50.041 --> 00:14:51.475 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah?

00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:52.610 position:33% line:89% align:start
Don't worry.

00:14:52.643 --> 00:14:54.947 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're not the only one
worried about Takky, you know.

00:14:57.582 --> 00:14:58.750 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:14:58.784 --> 00:15:01.753 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hirasawa hasn't told you,
but he's up to something, too.

00:15:01.787 --> 00:15:03.956 position:30% line:83% align:start
He put Panties
to work monitoring

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:05.457 position:27% line:83% align:start
the activity on
Takky's cell phone.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:06.860 position:7% line:89% align:start
He set it up so any logs sent

00:15:06.893 --> 00:15:09.028 position:16% line:83% align:start
to it are automatically
forwarded to Eden.

00:15:09.062 --> 00:15:10.864 position:13% line:89% align:start
As for the other Seleção,

00:15:10.897 --> 00:15:11.798 position:16% line:89% align:start
they're still engrossed

00:15:11.831 --> 00:15:13.499 position:24% line:83% align:start
in this mysterious
game they're playing.

00:15:13.533 --> 00:15:16.003 position:16% line:83% align:start
That could put the whole
country in some hot water.

00:15:16.036 --> 00:15:17.437 position:24% line:83% align:start
What if we're hit
by more missiles

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:18.806 position:16% line:89% align:start
or something even worse?

00:15:18.839 --> 00:15:21.141 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hold on, don't you think it's
too early?

00:15:21.175 --> 00:15:24.545 position:16% line:83% align:start
Isn't it about time that
you told Saki everything?

00:15:24.578 --> 00:15:25.981 position:10% line:89% align:start
The reason for this company.

00:15:26.014 --> 00:15:27.182 position:10% line:89% align:start
The fact that you founded it

00:15:27.215 --> 00:15:29.818 position:21% line:83% align:start
as a support system
to help Takky.

00:15:33.089 --> 00:15:34.824 position:30% line:83% align:start
Anyone can see
how much we owe him

00:15:34.857 --> 00:15:35.992 position:24% line:89% align:start
for all his help.

00:15:36.025 --> 00:15:37.960 position:16% line:83% align:start
So the way I figure it,
this time around,

00:15:37.994 --> 00:15:39.629 position:21% line:89% align:start
it's up to us NEETs.

00:15:39.662 --> 00:15:41.697 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're the ones who
have to save Takizawa,

00:15:41.731 --> 00:15:43.799 position:16% line:89% align:start
and the country as well.

00:15:44.734 --> 00:15:45.668 position:30% line:89% align:start
You mean that?

00:15:45.702 --> 00:15:48.538 position:21% line:83% align:start
Mhmm. Not that we're
actually NEETs anymore,

00:15:48.572 --> 00:15:49.940 position:19% line:89% align:start
but you get the point.

00:15:51.775 --> 00:15:52.943 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey, you guys have
to check this out!

00:15:52.977 --> 00:15:54.979 position:16% line:83% align:start
The new Prime Minister's
collapsed!

00:16:00.018 --> 00:16:01.552 position:38% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:16:02.087 --> 00:16:02.988 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wait a second.

00:16:03.022 --> 00:16:05.124 position:24% line:83% align:start
Didn't the name on
Takky's passport change

00:16:05.157 --> 00:16:07.159 position:16% line:89% align:start
from Takizawa to Iinuma?

00:16:07.192 --> 00:16:08.861 position:10% line:89% align:start
I wonder what Juiz is up to.

00:16:08.894 --> 00:16:09.728 position:27% line:89% align:start
I may be wrong,

00:16:09.762 --> 00:16:10.562 position:27% line:83% align:start
but I'm starting
to think she's trying

00:16:10.596 --> 00:16:13.066 position:33% line:83% align:start
to make him
Prime Minister of Japan.

00:16:15.601 --> 00:16:17.504 position:41% line:89% align:start
Look!

00:16:17.537 --> 00:16:20.006 position:21% line:83% align:start
"Leak out existence
of illegitimate child?"

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.077 position:13% line:83% align:start
So does that mean Takizawa
is the Prime Minister's son?

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:24.111 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-uh.

00:16:24.145 --> 00:16:25.545 position:30% line:83% align:start
It means she's
trying to make him

00:16:25.578 --> 00:16:27.181 position:5% line:89% align:start
the Prime Minister's successor.

00:16:27.214 --> 00:16:28.749 position:5% line:89% align:start
Changing his passport like this

00:16:28.783 --> 00:16:31.186 position:7% line:89% align:start
was part of her ultimate plan.

00:16:33.889 --> 00:16:35.090 position:27% line:89% align:start
This is insane.

00:16:35.123 --> 00:16:36.725 position:27% line:83% align:start
I thought he was
a little bit off.

00:16:36.758 --> 00:16:38.760 position:21% line:83% align:start
Who asks a computer
to erase his memories

00:16:38.794 --> 00:16:40.629 position:5% line:89% align:start
and make him king of a country?

00:16:40.662 --> 00:16:43.066 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then after doing so
just randomly disappeared.

00:16:43.099 --> 00:16:45.568 position:21% line:83% align:start
But Juiz has lost it
too if she thinks this

00:16:45.601 --> 00:16:48.171 position:19% line:83% align:start
is the way to go about
filling the request.

00:16:48.204 --> 00:16:49.706 position:16% line:89% align:start
There's still one thing.

00:16:49.739 --> 00:16:53.110 position:16% line:83% align:start
Just think for a second.
The chronology's off.

00:16:53.143 --> 00:16:55.612 position:16% line:83% align:start
Takky's passport changed
over six months ago,

00:16:55.646 --> 00:16:57.014 position:21% line:89% align:start
right after he left.

00:16:57.047 --> 00:16:59.950 position:10% line:83% align:start
Does that mean Juiz foresaw
all of this happening?

00:16:59.984 --> 00:17:01.219 position:33% line:83% align:start
Who the new
Prime Minister would be,

00:17:01.252 --> 00:17:03.121 position:24% line:83% align:start
and the fact that
he would collapse

00:17:03.154 --> 00:17:05.623 position:10% line:89% align:start
so early on while in office?

00:17:05.657 --> 00:17:08.526 position:24% line:83% align:start
Scary, that means
her power reaches

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.062 position:5% line:89% align:start
to the heart of the government.

00:17:10.096 --> 00:17:12.630 position:7% line:89% align:start
Never underestimate Saizo Ato.

00:17:12.664 --> 00:17:14.934 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's the lesson here.

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:15.868 position:5% line:89% align:start
I knew this would be difficult,

00:17:15.901 --> 00:17:20.273 position:21% line:83% align:start
but saving Takizawa
might be impossible.

00:17:24.578 --> 00:17:26.113 position:24% line:89% align:start
He's in New York?

00:17:26.146 --> 00:17:30.218 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I've never been to
New York with Takizawa before.

00:17:30.251 --> 00:17:31.651 position:7% line:89% align:start
Didn't the message he left you

00:17:31.685 --> 00:17:33.587 position:21% line:83% align:start
say something about
your 'special place'?

00:17:33.621 --> 00:17:34.589 position:7% line:89% align:start
Is there anywhere in New York

00:17:34.622 --> 00:17:37.625 position:19% line:83% align:start
that he'd think of as
being 'special' to you?

00:17:37.658 --> 00:17:40.329 position:27% line:89% align:start
Wait, maybe he-

00:17:40.362 --> 00:17:41.596 position:33% line:89% align:start
What, Saki?

00:17:41.629 --> 00:17:43.065 position:19% line:89% align:start
Have you got an idea?

00:17:44.233 --> 00:17:46.035 position:5% line:89% align:start
Two days later, I was on my way

00:17:46.068 --> 00:17:49.705 position:19% line:83% align:start
to the United States,
and New York City.

00:17:49.738 --> 00:17:52.142 position:30% line:83% align:start
I believed the
message Takizawa left

00:17:52.175 --> 00:17:53.309 position:7% line:89% align:start
about 'our place' was one that

00:17:53.343 --> 00:17:55.645 position:27% line:83% align:start
only I would be
able to understand.

00:17:58.648 --> 00:17:59.716 position:30% line:89% align:start
So here I am.

00:17:59.749 --> 00:18:02.186 position:19% line:83% align:start
But why did everything
have to turn out like this?

00:18:23.109 --> 00:18:24.644 position:24% line:89% align:start
Eden of the East?

00:18:24.677 --> 00:18:26.979 position:21% line:83% align:start
Saki, why didn't you
think to call us sooner?!

00:18:27.013 --> 00:18:29.316 position:19% line:83% align:start
We've all been worried
sick about you.

00:18:29.349 --> 00:18:31.018 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sorry.

00:18:31.051 --> 00:18:32.786 position:16% line:89% align:start
I've had a lot going on.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:33.854 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's a good thing
you checked in.

00:18:33.887 --> 00:18:36.156 position:19% line:83% align:start
Things have gone from
bad to worse around here.

00:18:36.191 --> 00:18:38.393 position:5% line:89% align:start
The Prime Minister passed away,

00:18:38.426 --> 00:18:40.862 position:19% line:83% align:start
and there's been more
activity on the phone logs.

00:18:40.895 --> 00:18:42.897 position:21% line:83% align:start
Seleção Number 6 and
Number 11 are headed

00:18:42.931 --> 00:18:44.766 position:19% line:89% align:start
to New York right now.

00:18:44.799 --> 00:18:46.302 position:16% line:89% align:start
And there's still more.

00:18:46.335 --> 00:18:49.338 position:5% line:83% align:start
Number 6 made a request to plant
something in your luggage.

00:18:49.371 --> 00:18:51.740 position:10% line:89% align:start
Check your bags immediately.

00:18:51.774 --> 00:18:53.676 position:24% line:89% align:start
That explains it.

00:18:55.911 --> 00:18:58.215 position:13% line:83% align:start
Wait. You mean something's
already happened?

00:18:58.248 --> 00:19:00.951 position:21% line:83% align:start
There were handguns
stuffed into my carry-on.

00:19:00.984 --> 00:19:02.886 position:5% line:89% align:start
The cab took off with my purse,

00:19:02.919 --> 00:19:05.722 position:19% line:83% align:start
and I lost my passport
and the Noblesse phone.

00:19:05.755 --> 00:19:06.857 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're kidding me?!

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:09.659 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why didn't you check the
phone as soon as you landed?!

00:19:10.795 --> 00:19:11.597 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:19:11.629 --> 00:19:13.831 position:27% line:83% align:start
I guess my mind
was somewhere else.

00:19:13.865 --> 00:19:16.033 position:35% line:89% align:start
Honestly!

00:19:16.067 --> 00:19:19.171 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, I hate to be the one to
kick you when you're down,

00:19:19.204 --> 00:19:21.306 position:13% line:83% align:start
but Seleção Number 2 sent
copies of Takizawa's passport

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.075 position:13% line:89% align:start
to all the major networks,

00:19:23.108 --> 00:19:25.711 position:21% line:83% align:start
claiming he was the
PM's illegitimate son...

00:19:25.744 --> 00:19:28.680 position:5% line:89% align:start
The information's out there now.

00:19:29.482 --> 00:19:31.217 position:19% line:83% align:start
Which means the whole
country's in an uproar

00:19:31.251 --> 00:19:33.086 position:24% line:83% align:start
about how Iinuma's
son is also wanted

00:19:33.119 --> 00:19:35.189 position:24% line:83% align:start
for questioning in
the missile attacks.

00:19:35.222 --> 00:19:37.091 position:24% line:83% align:start
They're after him
now more than ever.

00:19:37.124 --> 00:19:40.828 position:13% line:83% align:start
It looks like the movement
on Takizawa's log

00:19:40.861 --> 00:19:42.296 position:13% line:89% align:start
has motivated the Seleção

00:19:42.329 --> 00:19:46.201 position:24% line:83% align:start
to resume playing
their game in earnest.

00:19:46.234 --> 00:19:48.904 position:7% line:89% align:start
All that in just twelve hours?

00:19:48.937 --> 00:19:50.338 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm looking through these

00:19:50.372 --> 00:19:52.073 position:13% line:89% align:start
and from Number 11's logs,

00:19:52.107 --> 00:19:54.210 position:19% line:83% align:start
I think she's the one
you met in Roppongi,

00:19:54.243 --> 00:19:56.479 position:5% line:89% align:start
but Number 6 is still a mystery.

00:19:56.512 --> 00:19:59.115 position:16% line:83% align:start
Both of them asked Juiz
for Takky's location

00:19:59.148 --> 00:20:00.850 position:27% line:89% align:start
and were denied.

00:20:00.883 --> 00:20:02.084 position:5% line:89% align:start
Which means they'll probably try

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:03.986 position:13% line:89% align:start
to make contact with you.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.290 position:21% line:83% align:start
Actually, they might
already be onto you.

00:20:06.323 --> 00:20:07.457 position:41% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:20:11.028 --> 00:20:13.030 position:33% line:83% align:start
Whoever this
Number 6 character is,

00:20:13.063 --> 00:20:15.066 position:10% line:89% align:start
how'd they know about Saki?

00:20:15.099 --> 00:20:17.168 position:13% line:83% align:start
Probably because the media
was following her around

00:20:17.202 --> 00:20:19.103 position:7% line:89% align:start
for awhile after the missiles.

00:20:19.137 --> 00:20:20.472 position:5% line:89% align:start
Either that or because she took

00:20:20.506 --> 00:20:23.475 position:21% line:83% align:start
Takizawa's Noblesse
phone overseas with her.

00:20:23.509 --> 00:20:25.843 position:24% line:89% align:start
That makes sense.

00:20:25.877 --> 00:20:28.314 position:30% line:83% align:start
I wish we had
Number 6's identity.

00:20:28.347 --> 00:20:30.716 position:13% line:89% align:start
Not knowing creeps me out.

00:20:32.885 --> 00:20:33.886 position:10% line:89% align:start
None of us saw this coming,

00:20:33.919 --> 00:20:35.422 position:24% line:83% align:start
but we still have
to deal with it.

00:20:35.455 --> 00:20:38.291 position:5% line:83% align:start
You need to get to the consulate
general's office at once.

00:20:38.325 --> 00:20:40.260 position:33% line:89% align:start
What?! But--

00:20:40.293 --> 00:20:41.795 position:5% line:89% align:start
According to our latest reports,

00:20:41.828 --> 00:20:42.996 position:5% line:89% align:start
Iinuma's supporters are flocking

00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:45.399 position:30% line:83% align:start
to New York to
hunt down Takizawa.

00:20:45.433 --> 00:20:46.968 position:27% line:83% align:start
I know you don't
like hearing this,

00:20:47.001 --> 00:20:48.836 position:5% line:89% align:start
but I think you need to give up.

00:20:50.204 --> 00:20:52.039 position:38% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:20:52.073 --> 00:20:53.542 position:5% line:89% align:start
I have to find him, and quickly.

00:20:53.575 --> 00:20:56.411 position:19% line:83% align:start
If I don't, the press
is gonna skewer him

00:20:56.445 --> 00:20:58.313 position:21% line:83% align:start
when he doesn't even
remember anything.

00:20:58.347 --> 00:21:01.149 position:10% line:83% align:start
How many of our burdens has
he already taken on for us?

00:21:01.183 --> 00:21:03.852 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think we owe him
at least this much.

00:21:03.885 --> 00:21:06.189 position:16% line:83% align:start
Not if it means exposing
you to more danger.

00:21:06.222 --> 00:21:07.924 position:10% line:89% align:start
Think about this rationally.

00:21:07.957 --> 00:21:08.992 position:10% line:89% align:start
Where are you going to stay?

00:21:09.025 --> 00:21:11.127 position:13% line:83% align:start
You can't get a hotel room
without your passport.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.998 position:19% line:89% align:start
No more arguing Saki.

00:21:14.031 --> 00:21:16.400 position:13% line:83% align:start
I want you to hang up and
go straight to the consulate.

00:21:16.433 --> 00:21:17.868 position:33% line:89% align:start
You got it?

00:21:19.236 --> 00:21:20.804 position:30% line:89% align:start
No, Hirasawa.

00:21:20.838 --> 00:21:22.374 position:16% line:89% align:start
I came all the way here,

00:21:22.407 --> 00:21:25.443 position:21% line:83% align:start
and I'm not leaving
till I do all that I can.

00:21:25.477 --> 00:21:28.280 position:13% line:83% align:start
Takizawa left that message
specifically for me,

00:21:28.313 --> 00:21:30.081 position:33% line:83% align:start
and I think
I know what it means.

00:21:30.115 --> 00:21:31.250 position:13% line:89% align:start
I have to give it a shot.

00:21:31.284 --> 00:21:33.085 position:16% line:83% align:start
If I'm right about this,
I have a chance

00:21:33.119 --> 00:21:35.421 position:19% line:83% align:start
of reaching him before
the other Seleção do.

00:21:35.454 --> 00:21:38.458 position:21% line:83% align:start
I beg you. Just hang
on a little bit longer.

00:21:39.125 --> 00:21:40.993 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's a bad idea.

00:21:41.595 --> 00:21:45.065 position:19% line:83% align:start
The consulate general
closes at four o'clock.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.335 position:24% line:89% align:start
Please, Hirasawa.

00:21:51.539 --> 00:21:53.908 position:21% line:83% align:start
Okay, okay. But you
had better make sure

00:21:53.941 --> 00:21:56.411 position:16% line:83% align:start
you're at the consulate
no later than four!

00:21:56.444 --> 00:21:57.579 position:33% line:89% align:start
Understood?

00:21:57.613 --> 00:22:00.815 position:19% line:89% align:start
Got it, and thank you.

00:22:09.492 --> 00:22:11.294 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey, watch it, lady.

00:22:15.332 --> 00:22:16.966 position:24% line:89% align:start
He should be here.

00:22:17.334 --> 00:22:18.436 position:24% line:83% align:start
What kind of lame
hero doesn't show up

00:22:18.469 --> 00:22:21.205 position:7% line:89% align:start
when the heroine's in trouble?

00:22:22.973 --> 00:22:23.941 position:10% line:89% align:start
Maybe if we'd gone with her,

00:22:23.974 --> 00:22:26.177 position:16% line:83% align:start
she wouldn't have gotten
herself into this mess.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:29.180 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are you going to start
crying over spilt milk now?

00:22:29.213 --> 00:22:30.382 position:27% line:83% align:start
Besides, I think
she would've found

00:22:30.415 --> 00:22:32.918 position:24% line:83% align:start
a way to go alone
no matter what.

00:22:32.951 --> 00:22:34.086 position:38% line:89% align:start
I agree.

00:22:34.119 --> 00:22:37.222 position:19% line:83% align:start
Saki's a big girl and
she can take care of herself.

00:22:37.255 --> 00:22:38.156 position:27% line:89% align:start
Have some faith.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.360 position:24% line:83% align:start
Her secret travels
have worked out before.

00:22:40.393 --> 00:22:43.096 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's how she met
Takky in the first place.

00:22:43.129 --> 00:22:45.531 position:19% line:89% align:start
I guess you're right.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.541 position:19% line:89% align:start
I got your voicemail.

00:22:54.575 --> 00:22:55.242 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's going on?!

00:22:55.275 --> 00:22:56.877 position:27% line:89% align:start
Saki's missing?!

00:22:58.413 --> 00:22:59.381 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kasuga!

00:22:59.414 --> 00:23:01.416 position:19% line:89% align:start
It wasn't me, I swear!

00:23:01.449 --> 00:23:02.684 position:35% line:89% align:start
It was me.

00:23:02.717 --> 00:23:05.621 position:5% line:83% align:start
I figured he'd just bitch about
it later if we didn't tell him.

00:23:05.654 --> 00:23:08.923 position:24% line:83% align:start
How could you let
this happen, Hirasawa?!

00:23:08.957 --> 00:23:13.162 position:24% line:83% align:start
If she gets hurt,
then I am blaming you!

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.336 position:16% line:89% align:start
A simple group of NEETs,

00:23:19.369 --> 00:23:23.140 position:5% line:83% align:start
and this is all it takes to turn
them into crusaders overnight.

00:23:23.173 --> 00:23:25.942 position:27% line:83% align:start
Am I an awesome
producer or what?

00:23:25.976 --> 00:23:29.080 position:5% line:89% align:start
Seems like an entertaining job.

00:23:29.113 --> 00:23:30.314 position:24% line:89% align:start
One thing, though.

00:23:30.348 --> 00:23:32.683 position:24% line:83% align:start
How exactly do you
make money off of it?

00:23:33.317 --> 00:23:34.118 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, please.

00:23:34.152 --> 00:23:35.987 position:21% line:83% align:start
I couldn't care less
about the money.

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.221 position:30% line:89% align:start
But you know.

00:23:37.256 --> 00:23:38.624 position:30% line:83% align:start
It seems like
Public Security has been

00:23:38.657 --> 00:23:41.393 position:19% line:83% align:start
keeping tabs on these
new NEETs of mine.

00:23:41.427 --> 00:23:42.294 position:30% line:89% align:start
Level with me.

00:23:42.327 --> 00:23:44.329 position:24% line:83% align:start
You wouldn't know
anything about that?

00:23:44.363 --> 00:23:47.032 position:30% line:89% align:start
No, beats me.

00:23:47.065 --> 00:23:48.168 position:35% line:89% align:start
Of course.

00:23:48.201 --> 00:23:50.570 position:7% line:83% align:start
Anyway, it looks as if you've
been playing your cards

00:23:50.603 --> 00:23:52.405 position:21% line:89% align:start
as craftily as ever,

00:23:52.439 --> 00:23:55.409 position:27% line:83% align:start
for someone who
refuses to join the game.

00:23:55.443 --> 00:23:56.277 position:21% line:89% align:start
And what about you?

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.711 position:30% line:83% align:start
What change of
heart made you decide

00:23:57.745 --> 00:23:59.647 position:10% line:89% align:start
to take this all seriously?

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.384 position:19% line:83% align:start
You've never been the
slightest bit interested before.

00:24:03.417 --> 00:24:04.453 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's Number 9.

00:24:04.486 --> 00:24:06.655 position:5% line:89% align:start
I credit him for my inspiration.

00:24:06.688 --> 00:24:08.990 position:30% line:83% align:start
Besides which,
if I don't get a move on,

00:24:09.024 --> 00:24:11.460 position:24% line:83% align:start
the Supporter will
eliminate me, won't he?

00:24:11.493 --> 00:24:15.531 position:7% line:83% align:start
I assure you, the Supporter's
task doesn't belong to me.

00:24:15.565 --> 00:24:19.202 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm not even sure such
a position actually exists.

00:24:19.235 --> 00:24:22.138 position:16% line:83% align:start
But if it does, I would
think he was Number 12.

00:24:22.171 --> 00:24:23.607 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, I hope you
aren't expecting me

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.609 position:19% line:89% align:start
to begin trusting you.

00:24:25.642 --> 00:24:27.411 position:24% line:83% align:start
You might've made
Number 6 your puppet,

00:24:27.444 --> 00:24:30.180 position:13% line:83% align:start
but I have no intention of
letting you do that to me.

00:24:30.214 --> 00:24:32.550 position:24% line:83% align:start
I have nothing to
do with it this time.

00:24:32.584 --> 00:24:34.652 position:24% line:83% align:start
Sending him after
Number 9 couldn't possibly

00:24:34.686 --> 00:24:37.689 position:13% line:83% align:start
do anything to benefit me,
so why would I bother?

00:24:40.425 --> 00:24:43.127 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't much care what you
do at this point, anyway.

00:24:43.161 --> 00:24:45.564 position:24% line:83% align:start
You've been quite
busy massaging the law,

00:24:45.598 --> 00:24:48.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
rubbing elbows with
your politician friends.

00:24:48.501 --> 00:24:50.135 position:24% line:83% align:start
But while you were
otherwise occupied,

00:24:50.169 --> 00:24:52.271 position:7% line:89% align:start
I found a way to win the game.

00:24:52.304 --> 00:24:55.809 position:13% line:89% align:start
Did you? How interesting.

00:24:55.842 --> 00:24:56.877 position:16% line:89% align:start
Was leaking the identity

00:24:56.910 --> 00:25:00.080 position:10% line:83% align:start
of the Prime Minister's son
a part of your plan?

00:25:00.113 --> 00:25:02.517 position:7% line:89% align:start
I admit, I've been wondering.

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:05.486 position:24% line:89% align:start
I - won't - tell.

00:25:07.455 --> 00:25:09.524 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then we have nothing
more to talk about.

00:25:09.557 --> 00:25:23.806 position:21% line:89% align:start
We're all done here.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.675 position:21% line:89% align:start
Let's see, next up.

00:26:10.592 --> 00:26:11.693 position:10% line:89% align:start
We saw our own Ground Zero.

00:26:11.726 --> 00:26:15.229 position:16% line:83% align:start
One of the sites where a
missile hit on Careless Monday.

00:26:20.536 --> 00:26:23.739 position:13% line:83% align:start
Okay, so do I have to ride
that boat to find him?

00:27:04.417 --> 00:27:06.586 position:33% line:89% align:start
Good. Safe.

00:27:12.693 --> 00:27:13.962 position:30% line:89% align:start
Whatcha doing?

00:27:13.995 --> 00:27:16.563 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm not doing anything!
I was just-

00:27:33.649 --> 00:27:35.852 position:7% line:89% align:start
You call that nothing? A gun?

00:27:37.988 --> 00:27:38.889 position:33% line:89% align:start
Don't worry.

00:27:38.922 --> 00:27:41.425 position:24% line:83% align:start
Somebody made you
carry it, I'm guessing.

00:27:41.458 --> 00:27:43.226 position:24% line:89% align:start
It happens a lot.

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.528 position:16% line:89% align:start
Gun runners use tourists

00:27:44.561 --> 00:27:47.397 position:24% line:83% align:start
so they don't risk
taking the fall. May I?

00:27:57.976 --> 00:27:59.712 position:38% line:89% align:start
Now run!

00:28:21.035 --> 00:28:24.005 position:21% line:83% align:start
Nice! I don't think
anyone saw us.

00:28:26.541 --> 00:28:28.275 position:27% line:89% align:start
Take care, okay?

00:28:28.309 --> 00:28:31.012 position:27% line:89% align:start
Takizawa, wait!

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:42.025 position:24% line:83% align:start
"Takizawa?" Sorry,
but my name's Iinuma.

00:28:44.627 --> 00:28:46.530 position:10% line:89% align:start
Uh. Maybe you could help me.

00:28:46.563 --> 00:28:49.500 position:33% line:83% align:start
Mr. Iinuma.
I'm looking for someone.

00:28:50.501 --> 00:28:51.769 position:21% line:89% align:start
How can I help you?

00:28:51.802 --> 00:28:53.537 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, uh, well I think-

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:56.474 position:24% line:83% align:start
I have an idea of
where to find him.

00:28:56.508 --> 00:28:57.909 position:5% line:89% align:start
Except, I lost all of our things

00:28:57.942 --> 00:29:01.080 position:19% line:83% align:start
when I first got here,
his cell and my luggage.

00:29:01.113 --> 00:29:03.749 position:16% line:89% align:start
Man, that really sucks.

00:29:03.783 --> 00:29:06.752 position:7% line:83% align:start
I can give you a hand finding
them if you'd like me to.

00:29:06.786 --> 00:29:08.888 position:5% line:89% align:start
So where did you last see them?

00:29:08.921 --> 00:29:11.657 position:19% line:83% align:start
Back in the yellow cab
I took from the airport.

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:13.359 position:35% line:89% align:start
In a taxi?

00:29:13.392 --> 00:29:14.861 position:30% line:83% align:start
That means we
definitely have a chance

00:29:14.895 --> 00:29:17.464 position:27% line:83% align:start
of finding them,
so try not to worry.

00:29:17.497 --> 00:29:19.633 position:24% line:83% align:start
First off, do you
still have the receipt?

00:29:19.666 --> 00:29:21.735 position:35% line:89% align:start
Uh, yeah.

00:29:23.905 --> 00:29:25.706 position:41% line:89% align:start
Done!

00:29:32.513 --> 00:29:35.784 position:21% line:83% align:start
Finally, everyone's
following the script.

00:29:40.756 --> 00:29:41.757 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's after three.

00:29:41.791 --> 00:29:43.593 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't you think Saki
should have called by now?

00:29:54.772 --> 00:29:56.140 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't get your panties in a wad.

00:29:56.173 --> 00:29:57.775 position:16% line:89% align:start
There's still time left.

00:29:57.808 --> 00:29:59.677 position:21% line:89% align:start
But not much though.

00:30:01.012 --> 00:30:02.681 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey, Kasuga, I think
I'm gonna go ahead

00:30:02.714 --> 00:30:04.415 position:10% line:89% align:start
and get outta here, alright?

00:30:04.449 --> 00:30:07.519 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're scheduled
for four more hours.

00:30:07.552 --> 00:30:10.655 position:10% line:83% align:start
You can't just leave in the
middle of your shift like that.

00:30:10.689 --> 00:30:12.658 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's not like there's
a lot going on.

00:30:12.692 --> 00:30:15.595 position:10% line:83% align:start
Besides, you guys are still
here, so what's the big deal?

00:30:15.628 --> 00:30:17.763 position:19% line:83% align:start
Whether we're here or
not isn't the point.

00:30:17.797 --> 00:30:19.565 position:24% line:89% align:start
Let it go, Kasuga!

00:30:20.033 --> 00:30:21.034 position:24% line:89% align:start
You can head out.

00:30:21.068 --> 00:30:23.637 position:24% line:83% align:start
Have a good night.
Get some rest.

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:25.105 position:19% line:89% align:start
Thanks. See ya later!

00:30:25.138 --> 00:30:26.940 position:21% line:89% align:start
Goodnight, you guys!

00:30:27.808 --> 00:30:29.110 position:19% line:89% align:start
Kasuga's got the life.

00:30:29.143 --> 00:30:30.044 position:13% line:89% align:start
Treated like an exec just

00:30:30.078 --> 00:30:32.180 position:24% line:83% align:start
'cause he went to
Mr. Hirasawa's school.

00:30:32.213 --> 00:30:33.548 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, no kidding.

00:30:33.581 --> 00:30:35.483 position:24% line:89% align:start
Must be nice, huh.

00:30:36.851 --> 00:30:38.820 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kasuga.

00:30:42.157 --> 00:30:43.225 position:19% line:89% align:start
They're older than me,

00:30:43.259 --> 00:30:45.961 position:16% line:83% align:start
so I get why they don't
call me "Mr." like Hirasawa,

00:30:45.995 --> 00:30:47.663 position:24% line:83% align:start
but that isn't it.
They come in late.

00:30:47.696 --> 00:30:49.732 position:5% line:89% align:start
They won't work the night shift.

00:30:49.765 --> 00:30:51.167 position:19% line:89% align:start
They all want raises.

00:30:51.201 --> 00:30:53.003 position:19% line:83% align:start
They don't understand
what it takes

00:30:53.036 --> 00:30:55.505 position:30% line:83% align:start
to be an adult
in the work place.

00:30:55.538 --> 00:30:58.075 position:38% line:89% align:start
I know.

00:30:58.109 --> 00:31:01.212 position:16% line:83% align:start
We have a bunch of lazy,
good-for-nothing employees.

00:31:01.245 --> 00:31:03.648 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, maybe we should
just clean house

00:31:03.681 --> 00:31:04.749 position:16% line:89% align:start
and get rid of them all.

00:31:04.782 --> 00:31:06.184 position:41% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:31:06.218 --> 00:31:08.653 position:24% line:89% align:start
I get your point.

00:31:08.686 --> 00:31:09.354 position:13% line:89% align:start
I shouldn't be complaining

00:31:09.388 --> 00:31:11.657 position:5% line:89% align:start
about having people to help me.

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:14.660 position:7% line:89% align:start
I do understand how you feel.

00:31:14.693 --> 00:31:15.894 position:7% line:89% align:start
The old guys who take success

00:31:15.928 --> 00:31:17.964 position:5% line:89% align:start
for granted should be the enemy.

00:31:17.997 --> 00:31:20.166 position:21% line:83% align:start
But I get what they
feel like now, too.

00:31:20.199 --> 00:31:21.067 position:16% line:89% align:start
And that's what it means

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.003 position:21% line:83% align:start
to be a full-fledged
member of society.

00:31:29.009 --> 00:31:31.245 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hard at work stuffing
your faces, huh?

00:31:31.278 --> 00:31:34.014 position:16% line:83% align:start
I hope you haven't lost
your NEET spirit already.

00:31:34.282 --> 00:31:35.183 position:13% line:89% align:start
You can't lose your drive

00:31:35.216 --> 00:31:37.118 position:21% line:83% align:start
just because you've
gone into business.

00:31:37.152 --> 00:31:38.820 position:30% line:83% align:start
Seriously, you
don't want to give in

00:31:38.853 --> 00:31:42.223 position:7% line:83% align:start
to the man like all the other
lame adults out there, do you?

00:31:42.257 --> 00:31:43.892 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, exactly!

00:31:43.925 --> 00:31:44.726 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, hey there, Kasuga.

00:31:44.759 --> 00:31:49.031 position:27% line:83% align:start
What's up? How's
it hangin'? Micchon.

00:31:51.133 --> 00:31:52.335 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's this thing?

00:31:52.369 --> 00:31:55.771 position:5% line:83% align:start
I took the liberty of amping up
Eden's search engine for ya.

00:31:55.805 --> 00:31:58.175 position:24% line:83% align:start
That little baby's
a real piece of work.

00:31:58.208 --> 00:31:59.242 position:13% line:89% align:start
It'll give us free access

00:31:59.276 --> 00:32:01.778 position:27% line:83% align:start
to data we could
never access before.

00:32:01.812 --> 00:32:04.514 position:7% line:83% align:start
There's gotta be pre-Takizawa
info lyin' around somewhere,

00:32:04.548 --> 00:32:07.952 position:21% line:83% align:start
stuff from before he
was playing this game.

00:32:12.857 --> 00:32:15.961 position:13% line:83% align:start
Let's find out a bit more
about Vintage Boy's past.

00:32:15.995 --> 00:32:17.963 position:16% line:83% align:start
Once we do that, we can
stop people from thinking

00:32:17.997 --> 00:32:20.666 position:21% line:83% align:start
he's Prime Minister
Iinuma's son or whatever.

00:32:20.699 --> 00:32:21.934 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.263 position:24% line:83% align:start
Um, did I take you
away from your job?

00:32:48.296 --> 00:32:49.998 position:33% line:89% align:start
Don't worry.

00:32:50.032 --> 00:32:52.301 position:16% line:83% align:start
I was just on my way to
a party for a coworker.

00:32:52.335 --> 00:32:54.937 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh. Okay.

00:32:58.007 --> 00:32:58.941 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, cheer up.

00:32:58.975 --> 00:33:01.544 position:27% line:83% align:start
We're gonna find
your bags, 'kay?

00:33:02.212 --> 00:33:03.080 position:19% line:89% align:start
Then you can catch up

00:33:03.113 --> 00:33:04.580 position:21% line:83% align:start
with the person you
were looking for.

00:33:04.614 --> 00:33:06.616 position:24% line:89% align:start
That Takizawa guy.

00:33:06.649 --> 00:33:07.851 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:33:07.885 --> 00:33:08.952 position:30% line:89% align:start
So, who is he?

00:33:08.986 --> 00:33:10.254 position:7% line:89% align:start
An old boyfriend or something?

00:33:10.287 --> 00:33:11.755 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, no! That's not it.

00:33:11.789 --> 00:33:16.627 position:24% line:83% align:start
Takizawa, he was a
good friend of mine.

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:20.131 position:24% line:83% align:start
Six months ago he
disappeared into thin air.

00:33:20.165 --> 00:33:21.066 position:19% line:89% align:start
I eventually found out

00:33:21.099 --> 00:33:23.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
that he was living
here in New York City.

00:33:23.735 --> 00:33:24.702 position:7% line:89% align:start
But even though we were close,

00:33:24.736 --> 00:33:27.873 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't think he's going
to remember me at all.

00:33:27.907 --> 00:33:29.275 position:24% line:89% align:start
Wow, that's harsh.

00:33:29.308 --> 00:33:32.912 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yeah, no kidding. It's rough.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:58.874 position:35% line:89% align:start
Follow me.

00:33:58.907 --> 00:34:00.776 position:27% line:83% align:start
I found out who
your taxi driver was.

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:14.125 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's him there!

00:34:16.794 --> 00:34:19.630 position:10% line:89% align:start
Uh-oh. He looks kinda scary.

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:27.639 position:27% line:83% align:start
There. Stay just
like that for me, okay?

00:34:32.011 --> 00:34:33.279 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hi!

00:34:34.814 --> 00:34:36.015 position:27% line:83% align:start
Do you happen to
know if anybody left

00:34:36.048 --> 00:34:39.886 position:16% line:83% align:start
a cell phone in your cab
earlier today? Or a bag?

00:34:40.786 --> 00:34:42.923 position:13% line:89% align:start
I don't know nothin', pal.

00:34:46.026 --> 00:34:47.362 position:21% line:89% align:start
You sure about that?

00:34:47.395 --> 00:34:50.898 position:24% line:83% align:start
See, I'm a police
officer, from Japan.

00:34:51.332 --> 00:34:53.134 position:30% line:89% align:start
You're a cop?

00:34:53.168 --> 00:34:56.804 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you recognize that
young lady over there, sir?

00:34:56.838 --> 00:35:02.178 position:10% line:83% align:start
She may not look it, but she
is a dangerous terrorist.

00:35:02.211 --> 00:35:04.246 position:24% line:89% align:start
She's a terrorist?

00:35:07.883 --> 00:35:10.320 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yes! I finally
managed to catch her.

00:35:10.353 --> 00:35:13.490 position:7% line:83% align:start
But I'm still looking for the
bomb that she was carrying.

00:35:13.523 --> 00:35:18.396 position:5% line:89% align:start
Did you hear me? B-O-M-B. Bomb!

00:35:18.429 --> 00:35:19.597 position:38% line:89% align:start
A bomb?

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:23.401 position:7% line:83% align:start
Apparently it's been cleverly
disguised as a cell phone.

00:35:23.434 --> 00:35:26.471 position:13% line:83% align:start
If I don't find it, things
are gonna get ugly quick.

00:35:26.505 --> 00:35:30.242 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's really important that you
help me out here, or KABOOM!

00:35:30.275 --> 00:35:31.243 position:35% line:89% align:start
You know?

00:35:31.276 --> 00:35:34.413 position:35% line:89% align:start
Well, uh-

00:35:34.446 --> 00:35:36.382 position:24% line:83% align:start
Maybe I've got the
wrong place then.

00:35:36.416 --> 00:35:40.520 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll keep asking around.
See ya. Have a good day.

00:35:40.553 --> 00:35:42.922 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, hey, hey. Wait up a second.

00:35:45.925 --> 00:35:48.195 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is this the purse
that you're looking for?

00:35:54.068 --> 00:35:55.102 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yep, it's here.

00:35:55.135 --> 00:35:56.870 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm just glad we
found it in time.

00:35:56.904 --> 00:35:59.541 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yeah, me too.
That was a close call.

00:35:59.574 --> 00:36:02.244 position:27% line:83% align:start
Thanks for your
cooperation, sir!

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:06.249 position:35% line:89% align:start
I got it!

00:36:06.282 --> 00:36:08.117 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wow, he didn't look
like he wanted to help.

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:09.151 position:10% line:89% align:start
Keep up the good work, man!

00:36:09.185 --> 00:36:10.019 position:24% line:89% align:start
He was all right.

00:36:10.052 --> 00:36:16.125 position:27% line:83% align:start
I just needed to
explain the situation.

00:36:16.426 --> 00:36:17.561 position:33% line:89% align:start
'Kay. Here.

00:36:17.594 --> 00:36:19.829 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, and I'd avoid
taking another cab back

00:36:19.863 --> 00:36:22.499 position:24% line:83% align:start
to the airport if
I were you, just to be safe.

00:36:22.532 --> 00:36:23.433 position:38% line:89% align:start
So long.

00:36:23.467 --> 00:36:26.537 position:27% line:89% align:start
Please hold on.

00:36:26.571 --> 00:36:28.539 position:16% line:89% align:start
Is there something else?

00:36:28.573 --> 00:36:30.975 position:35% line:89% align:start
Um, yeah.

00:36:31.009 --> 00:36:32.343 position:24% line:83% align:start
Remember earlier,
when I told you

00:36:32.377 --> 00:36:35.113 position:30% line:83% align:start
about the guy
I'd been looking for?

00:36:35.146 --> 00:36:36.282 position:33% line:89% align:start
I meant you!

00:36:36.315 --> 00:36:37.882 position:13% line:89% align:start
I've been looking for you.

00:36:37.915 --> 00:36:42.421 position:24% line:83% align:start
Good one! You were
looking for me?

00:36:42.454 --> 00:36:44.357 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm flattered but-

00:36:58.606 --> 00:37:00.174 position:33% line:89% align:start
Is that me?

00:37:02.544 --> 00:37:03.645 position:13% line:89% align:start
I've been looking for you

00:37:03.679 --> 00:37:07.049 position:7% line:83% align:start
for six months straight--ever
since you disappeared.

00:37:17.493 --> 00:37:19.896 position:16% line:89% align:start
What d'ya say, my place?

00:37:19.929 --> 00:37:21.998 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:37:33.043 --> 00:37:33.944 position:13% line:89% align:start
Freak out all you'd like,

00:37:33.977 --> 00:37:35.979 position:24% line:83% align:start
but it's not going
to accomplish anything.

00:37:36.013 --> 00:37:39.150 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, but she's late!

00:37:43.356 --> 00:37:45.990 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey. Saki sent an email.

00:37:46.025 --> 00:37:48.861 position:7% line:89% align:start
She says "I found Takizawa."

00:37:49.696 --> 00:37:51.163 position:13% line:89% align:start
With his help, I was able

00:37:51.197 --> 00:37:53.600 position:19% line:83% align:start
to get my passport and
the cell phone back, too.

00:37:56.036 --> 00:37:58.672 position:5% line:83% align:start
So is she coming to his rescue,
or is he coming to hers?

00:37:58.706 --> 00:38:00.641 position:19% line:83% align:start
What I'd like to know
is how she found him.

00:38:00.675 --> 00:38:02.377 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, isn't it obvious?

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:04.945 position:24% line:83% align:start
Love brought them
together, what else?

00:38:08.182 --> 00:38:09.183 position:30% line:89% align:start
Is there more?

00:38:09.217 --> 00:38:10.151 position:19% line:83% align:start
"For now we're headed
back to his apartment.

00:38:10.184 --> 00:38:13.355 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll write more when
I have time." That's it.

00:38:14.356 --> 00:38:17.192 position:10% line:89% align:start
This is so exciting. Right?

00:38:21.564 --> 00:38:24.300 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, perhaps somebody
should respond to Saki's email

00:38:24.334 --> 00:38:27.137 position:24% line:83% align:start
and remind her to
use good judgment.

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:30.641 position:10% line:89% align:start
Saki! No! You can't do this!

00:38:30.674 --> 00:38:33.143 position:19% line:83% align:start
You can't do anything
about it now, Osugi.

00:38:33.177 --> 00:38:36.080 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's time to accept the facts
and move on with your life.

00:38:36.113 --> 00:38:37.148 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm ashamed of you.

00:38:37.181 --> 00:38:40.017 position:19% line:83% align:start
You must remember what
the NEET youth stand for.

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:42.687 position:19% line:83% align:start
We don't roll over and
give in to the status quo.

00:38:42.721 --> 00:38:44.089 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's our solemn duty

00:38:44.122 --> 00:38:46.358 position:21% line:83% align:start
to help Osugi fight
for what he believes.

00:38:46.391 --> 00:38:47.959 position:21% line:89% align:start
Am I right, Micchon?

00:38:47.993 --> 00:38:49.428 position:24% line:89% align:start
I don't think so.

00:39:22.431 --> 00:39:24.133 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yes. Juiz here.

00:39:24.166 --> 00:39:27.403 position:13% line:83% align:start
Did you see to it that she
got safely away this morning?

00:39:27.436 --> 00:39:28.672 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:39:28.705 --> 00:39:31.475 position:7% line:83% align:start
I caused a minor car accident
to distract the police from her.

00:39:31.508 --> 00:39:35.312 position:5% line:83% align:start
I generally prefer more elegant
methods, but time was short.

00:39:35.345 --> 00:39:36.546 position:30% line:89% align:start
I understand.

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.683 position:30% line:83% align:start
It was outside
the effective range.

00:39:38.716 --> 00:39:40.651 position:16% line:89% align:start
You did what you could.

00:39:40.685 --> 00:39:42.420 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're too kind.

00:39:42.453 --> 00:39:44.422 position:30% line:83% align:start
Will there be
anything else for now?

00:39:44.455 --> 00:39:49.461 position:10% line:83% align:start
No, no. I think that should
be all, but thank you.

00:39:49.495 --> 00:39:51.530 position:35% line:89% align:start
Very well.

00:39:51.563 --> 00:39:53.065 position:30% line:89% align:start
What's wrong?

00:39:53.098 --> 00:39:54.533 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's just that we
haven't followed

00:39:54.566 --> 00:39:57.002 position:13% line:89% align:start
our usual routine lately.

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:01.941 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's true.

00:40:01.975 --> 00:40:05.144 position:10% line:83% align:start
I haven't set my blade to a
man's Johnny in quite awhile.

00:40:05.178 --> 00:40:06.412 position:35% line:89% align:start
Is it me?

00:40:06.446 --> 00:40:08.616 position:19% line:83% align:start
Have I done something
to disappoint you?

00:40:08.649 --> 00:40:10.551 position:16% line:89% align:start
No, Juiz. It's not you.

00:40:10.584 --> 00:40:13.621 position:10% line:83% align:start
I have other business I need
to attend to at the moment.

00:40:13.654 --> 00:40:15.624 position:27% line:89% align:start
May I ask what?

00:40:25.534 --> 00:40:28.337 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is Number 1,
Daiju Mononobe.

00:40:28.371 --> 00:40:31.774 position:7% line:83% align:start
This smarmy, preppy, four-eyed
jerk is the Seleção who hit me.

00:40:31.807 --> 00:40:33.676 position:21% line:83% align:start
He left his position
in the bureaucracy

00:40:33.709 --> 00:40:36.647 position:16% line:83% align:start
and got an executive job
with Ato and Company.

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.349 position:21% line:83% align:start
His objective was to
become the new Mr. Outside,

00:40:39.383 --> 00:40:40.784 position:16% line:89% align:start
but he botched the plan.

00:40:40.817 --> 00:40:43.487 position:24% line:83% align:start
No idea what he's
been up to since.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.455 position:7% line:89% align:start
We don't know who Number 2 is.

00:40:45.489 --> 00:40:47.759 position:24% line:83% align:start
His requests tend
toward the criminal side,

00:40:47.792 --> 00:40:50.495 position:24% line:83% align:start
but he's kept his
identity well hidden.

00:40:50.528 --> 00:40:53.197 position:21% line:83% align:start
Number 6 is sneakin'
around New York right now.

00:40:53.231 --> 00:40:54.733 position:30% line:83% align:start
We don't know
his identity either,

00:40:54.767 --> 00:40:55.901 position:19% line:89% align:start
but from his requests,

00:40:55.935 --> 00:40:59.271 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'd guess he's some kinda
film producer or somethin'.

00:40:59.305 --> 00:41:00.272 position:35% line:89% align:start
In short.

00:41:00.306 --> 00:41:02.408 position:16% line:83% align:start
I think we need to view
these three as a threat.

00:41:02.441 --> 00:41:04.343 position:16% line:83% align:start
I doubt that they've got
anything good in mind

00:41:04.376 --> 00:41:05.779 position:21% line:89% align:start
for ol' Vintage Boy.

00:41:05.812 --> 00:41:07.747 position:30% line:83% align:start
And Number 10,
Ryo Yuki, it looks like

00:41:07.781 --> 00:41:10.584 position:10% line:83% align:start
he's moved from the 'danger'
list onto the 'drop-out' list'.

00:41:10.617 --> 00:41:11.651 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:41:11.685 --> 00:41:13.754 position:21% line:83% align:start
His behavior changed
after the missile incident.

00:41:13.788 --> 00:41:15.422 position:27% line:83% align:start
He's been makin'
requests to have Number 9

00:41:15.455 --> 00:41:18.793 position:13% line:83% align:start
assassinated over and over
but been denied every time.

00:41:18.826 --> 00:41:21.662 position:13% line:83% align:start
Three days ago, his phone
finally went completely dark.

00:41:21.696 --> 00:41:22.731 position:5% line:89% align:start
That sounds like the same thing

00:41:22.764 --> 00:41:24.566 position:13% line:89% align:start
that happened to Number 4.

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:27.769 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yep. No telling yet
whether he's dead or alive.

00:41:27.803 --> 00:41:30.439 position:21% line:83% align:start
Number 10 had money
left in his account though,

00:41:30.472 --> 00:41:31.740 position:16% line:89% align:start
just like Number 4 did.

00:41:31.773 --> 00:41:33.241 position:5% line:89% align:start
So it's possible someone decided

00:41:33.275 --> 00:41:35.745 position:21% line:83% align:start
that he wasn't worth
havin' around anymore.

00:41:35.778 --> 00:41:38.514 position:21% line:83% align:start
Somebody else's got
me wondern', though.

00:41:38.548 --> 00:41:40.583 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's Number 5, Hajime Hiura.

00:41:40.617 --> 00:41:41.785 position:16% line:89% align:start
Dude's completely broke.

00:41:41.819 --> 00:41:43.419 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's not a cent
left in his account,

00:41:43.453 --> 00:41:45.456 position:7% line:89% align:start
but somehow, he's still alive.

00:41:49.226 --> 00:41:50.794 position:24% line:83% align:start
I went to see him
to check on his status

00:41:50.829 --> 00:41:52.229 position:30% line:83% align:start
and what-not,
but he wasn't runnin'

00:41:52.262 --> 00:41:54.298 position:7% line:89% align:start
that hospital of his anymore.

00:41:54.331 --> 00:41:55.467 position:24% line:89% align:start
And you know why?

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:57.569 position:27% line:83% align:start
'Cause he'd lost
all his memories.

00:41:57.602 --> 00:42:00.505 position:16% line:83% align:start
Even when I reminded him
he owned a huge hospital,

00:42:00.538 --> 00:42:02.875 position:21% line:83% align:start
he had no clue what
I was talkin' about.

00:42:02.908 --> 00:42:06.312 position:13% line:83% align:start
He was pretty rattled when
I explained the situation,

00:42:06.345 --> 00:42:08.180 position:27% line:83% align:start
but the old man
caught on a lot faster

00:42:08.214 --> 00:42:09.916 position:13% line:89% align:start
than I would've expected.

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:11.885 position:30% line:89% align:start
It was weird.

00:42:11.918 --> 00:42:14.421 position:13% line:83% align:start
When he realized he really
did build a hospital,

00:42:14.454 --> 00:42:17.691 position:10% line:83% align:start
he just accepted it, like it
was meant to be or somethin'.

00:42:17.724 --> 00:42:19.593 position:24% line:83% align:start
Even with all his
memories wiped out,

00:42:19.626 --> 00:42:20.928 position:30% line:83% align:start
it seems like
he'd still rather look

00:42:20.962 --> 00:42:22.897 position:5% line:89% align:start
at the positive side of things.

00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:23.798 position:21% line:89% align:start
If his money's gone,

00:42:23.831 --> 00:42:25.265 position:21% line:83% align:start
why do you think he
hasn't been killed

00:42:25.299 --> 00:42:26.601 position:19% line:89% align:start
by the Supporter yet?

00:42:26.634 --> 00:42:27.835 position:7% line:89% align:start
These guys don't mess around.

00:42:27.869 --> 00:42:29.570 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's some reason
he's still alive,

00:42:29.604 --> 00:42:31.940 position:16% line:83% align:start
and the only thing I can
think of is that he won.

00:42:31.974 --> 00:42:34.242 position:24% line:83% align:start
But remember what
happens if somebody wins?

00:42:34.275 --> 00:42:36.578 position:19% line:83% align:start
The other Seleção are
supposed to be eliminated.

00:42:36.612 --> 00:42:38.480 position:19% line:89% align:start
It doesn't make sense.

00:42:38.514 --> 00:42:39.448 position:13% line:89% align:start
You've got a point there.

00:42:39.481 --> 00:42:41.685 position:21% line:83% align:start
But maybe we've been
looking at all of this

00:42:41.718 --> 00:42:42.819 position:13% line:83% align:start
from the wrong angle-Have
you ever considered

00:42:42.852 --> 00:42:44.921 position:13% line:83% align:start
that Mr. Outside means to
eliminate their memories,

00:42:44.954 --> 00:42:46.856 position:16% line:89% align:start
not their actual lives?

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:48.525 position:10% line:89% align:start
Perhaps. Interesting theory,

00:42:48.558 --> 00:42:51.528 position:10% line:83% align:start
but, he said any Seleção who
broke the rules would die.

00:42:51.561 --> 00:42:52.897 position:21% line:83% align:start
There're still tons
of uncertainties.

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:54.230 position:13% line:89% align:start
Like, what if Mr. Outside

00:42:54.264 --> 00:42:55.866 position:30% line:83% align:start
and Number 12
are the same person?

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:57.401 position:21% line:83% align:start
That'd change up the
entire game, wouldn't it?

00:42:57.435 --> 00:43:00.371 position:21% line:83% align:start
One guy keeping tabs
on the other Seleção,

00:43:00.404 --> 00:43:01.640 position:7% line:89% align:start
makin' them play by the rules,

00:43:01.673 --> 00:43:03.675 position:27% line:83% align:start
and dishin' out
penalties all by himself.

00:43:03.709 --> 00:43:06.344 position:7% line:83% align:start
He'd be running around like a
chicken with its head cut off.

00:43:06.378 --> 00:43:07.345 position:21% line:89% align:start
But Juiz would help.

00:43:07.379 --> 00:43:08.613 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's what she's there for.

00:43:08.647 --> 00:43:09.816 position:10% line:89% align:start
Nope. I didn't find anything

00:43:09.849 --> 00:43:11.851 position:27% line:83% align:start
in the logs that
pointed to that.

00:43:11.884 --> 00:43:13.352 position:27% line:83% align:start
He's the one who
organized the game

00:43:13.386 --> 00:43:15.321 position:21% line:83% align:start
in the first place,
so maybe he's been outside

00:43:15.354 --> 00:43:16.856 position:7% line:89% align:start
the rules from the beginning.

00:43:16.889 --> 00:43:18.357 position:7% line:89% align:start
If so, then why would he leave

00:43:18.391 --> 00:43:20.359 position:7% line:89% align:start
a record of transportin' Juiz?

00:43:20.393 --> 00:43:22.596 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you ask me, old
Saizo Ato's gone batty,

00:43:22.629 --> 00:43:25.432 position:5% line:83% align:start
but he's still run a consistent,
streamlined game so far.

00:43:25.466 --> 00:43:26.400 position:16% line:89% align:start
The geezer really seems

00:43:26.433 --> 00:43:28.702 position:16% line:83% align:start
to know what he's doing,
even if it is nuts.

00:43:28.736 --> 00:43:29.838 position:27% line:89% align:start
Think about it.

00:43:29.871 --> 00:43:31.405 position:30% line:83% align:start
He's got this
crazy idea that no one

00:43:31.438 --> 00:43:33.708 position:13% line:83% align:start
in their right mind would
willingly go along with.

00:43:33.742 --> 00:43:35.543 position:7% line:89% align:start
So, in order to motivate 'em,

00:43:35.577 --> 00:43:36.946 position:30% line:83% align:start
he invents the
role of the Supporter,

00:43:36.979 --> 00:43:39.547 position:10% line:83% align:start
and he makes them all think
it's a life-or-death game.

00:43:39.581 --> 00:43:41.917 position:13% line:83% align:start
Which also increases their
suspicion of each other,

00:43:41.951 --> 00:43:44.520 position:19% line:83% align:start
like when they thought
Takizawa was the Supporter.

00:43:44.553 --> 00:43:47.423 position:7% line:83% align:start
Of course, it could be nothin'
but wishful thinkin' on my part.

00:43:47.456 --> 00:43:48.925 position:30% line:83% align:start
Well, it'd be
good news for Takky.

00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:50.627 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's burning through
his balance quickly.

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:52.562 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't know how long
it'll last at this rate.

00:43:52.596 --> 00:43:54.965 position:16% line:83% align:start
We shouldn't jump to any
conclusions yet, though.

00:43:54.998 --> 00:43:56.033 position:33% line:89% align:start
She's right.

00:43:56.067 --> 00:43:58.502 position:19% line:83% align:start
We've gotta be careful
not to get too optimistic.

00:44:20.994 --> 00:44:23.730 position:21% line:83% align:start
Huh, so I'm in this
group called the Seleção,

00:44:23.763 --> 00:44:26.399 position:13% line:83% align:start
my code name is Number 9,
and I'm wanted for questioning

00:44:26.432 --> 00:44:28.936 position:30% line:83% align:start
about that big
Japanese missile crisis.

00:44:29.937 --> 00:44:32.740 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's kinda like that movie,
The Man Who Stole the Sun.

00:44:32.773 --> 00:44:36.077 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's not a movie!
It's true, I swear!

00:44:36.111 --> 00:44:39.748 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey, don't worry; I never
said I didn't believe you.

00:44:43.485 --> 00:44:45.387 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, this is our stop.

00:44:49.625 --> 00:44:50.993 position:38% line:89% align:start
A hotel?

00:44:53.462 --> 00:44:55.498 position:21% line:89% align:start
Heeeeyyyy! Air King!

00:44:55.531 --> 00:44:57.567 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey there!

00:45:04.943 --> 00:45:05.844 position:24% line:89% align:start
That happen a lot?

00:45:05.877 --> 00:45:07.444 position:7% line:89% align:start
People calling you 'Air King'?

00:45:07.477 --> 00:45:08.713 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yep.

00:45:08.746 --> 00:45:10.748 position:7% line:83% align:start
People I don't even know walk
right up to me on the street.

00:45:10.782 --> 00:45:12.383 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's part of the
reason I didn't just

00:45:12.417 --> 00:45:15.420 position:16% line:83% align:start
blow off your story, no
matter how weird it was.

00:45:15.453 --> 00:45:16.487 position:24% line:89% align:start
It might be true.

00:45:16.521 --> 00:45:19.091 position:21% line:83% align:start
Without my memories,
how can I say that it's not?

00:45:19.124 --> 00:45:21.527 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hell. Just looking
at this picture

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:24.530 position:27% line:83% align:start
makes me believe
I'm the real thing.

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:31.137 position:19% line:83% align:start
All right, they're in
room 801 of the Gramercy Hotel.

00:45:31.171 --> 00:45:32.405 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't care what
you have to do...

00:45:32.439 --> 00:45:35.475 position:7% line:83% align:start
just make them take a shower,
then do exactly what I told you.

00:45:35.508 --> 00:45:37.477 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, but I'm
afraid I don't understand

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:39.013 position:13% line:89% align:start
the point of your request.

00:45:39.046 --> 00:45:41.515 position:16% line:89% align:start
Come on. Think about it.

00:45:41.549 --> 00:45:44.052 position:21% line:83% align:start
In every great movie
featuring a couple on the run

00:45:44.086 --> 00:45:46.454 position:19% line:83% align:start
from the authorities,
the two lovebirds inevitable

00:45:46.487 --> 00:45:48.490 position:30% line:83% align:start
end up in the
shower at some point.

00:45:48.523 --> 00:45:51.593 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's a classic motif that
I can't simply overlook.

00:45:51.627 --> 00:45:53.897 position:19% line:83% align:start
Classic motif or not,
not even something

00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:55.832 position:30% line:83% align:start
as powerful as
the Seleção system

00:45:55.865 --> 00:45:57.800 position:10% line:89% align:start
can control the human will.

00:45:57.834 --> 00:46:01.037 position:10% line:83% align:start
Besides which, you're at the
edge of the effective range.

00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:02.906 position:21% line:89% align:start
My scope is limited.

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:04.875 position:33% line:83% align:start
No, no, no!
Hold on a sec. Not fair!

00:46:04.909 --> 00:46:06.810 position:24% line:83% align:start
I know for a fact
you're supplying Number 9

00:46:06.844 --> 00:46:09.179 position:19% line:83% align:start
with cash from a bank
account that you created.

00:46:09.213 --> 00:46:11.916 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's totally against
the rules, and you know it.

00:46:11.949 --> 00:46:12.850 position:10% line:89% align:start
If you're doing it for him,

00:46:12.883 --> 00:46:14.986 position:24% line:83% align:start
why can't you bend
the rules for me, too?!

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:16.721 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's different.

00:46:16.755 --> 00:46:19.190 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's part of Number 9's
request to become king.

00:46:19.224 --> 00:46:22.494 position:16% line:83% align:start
As such, it is perfectly
in keeping with the rules.

00:46:22.527 --> 00:46:24.663 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, all right. I get it now.

00:46:24.697 --> 00:46:26.732 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then I want you to
make me a king, too!

00:46:26.766 --> 00:46:28.034 position:7% line:89% align:start
The process of becoming a king

00:46:28.067 --> 00:46:30.036 position:7% line:89% align:start
is different for each Seleção.

00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:32.906 position:16% line:89% align:start
You may not be eligible.

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:35.976 position:10% line:83% align:start
Please wait while I confirm
if your request is possible.

00:46:36.009 --> 00:46:37.144 position:16% line:89% align:start
This may take a moment.

00:46:37.177 --> 00:46:39.046 position:24% line:83% align:start
Do you really have
to be so difficult?!

00:46:39.079 --> 00:46:40.948 position:24% line:89% align:start
Will that be all?

00:46:40.981 --> 00:46:42.850 position:27% line:83% align:start
Fine, then just
do what I told ya to

00:46:42.884 --> 00:46:45.620 position:10% line:83% align:start
in the first fuckin' place!
Can you handle that?!

00:46:45.653 --> 00:46:48.856 position:19% line:83% align:start
Accepted. I pray that
you become a savior

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:51.260 position:27% line:83% align:start
who knows how to
watch his mouth better.

00:46:55.531 --> 00:46:59.835 position:16% line:83% align:start
Damn her; she's becoming
more of a smart-ass every day.

00:47:07.143 --> 00:47:09.045 position:19% line:89% align:start
Nice room, Mr. Iinuma!

00:47:09.079 --> 00:47:11.815 position:7% line:89% align:start
How did you pay for all this?

00:47:11.849 --> 00:47:13.851 position:35% line:89% align:start
Wasn't me.

00:47:13.884 --> 00:47:16.821 position:10% line:83% align:start
Oh, and feel free to call me
Takizawa if you'd prefer.

00:47:19.224 --> 00:47:20.292 position:24% line:83% align:start
So do you remember
anything that's happened

00:47:20.325 --> 00:47:22.861 position:30% line:83% align:start
since all your
memories disappeared?

00:47:22.894 --> 00:47:23.795 position:27% line:89% align:start
It was strange.

00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:25.731 position:27% line:83% align:start
The cops up and
released me outta nowhere.

00:47:25.764 --> 00:47:27.566 position:10% line:89% align:start
They gave me business cards

00:47:27.599 --> 00:47:31.170 position:13% line:83% align:start
and a passport in Iinuma's
name and all these keys.

00:47:31.204 --> 00:47:32.138 position:16% line:89% align:start
Then I got a phone call.

00:47:32.171 --> 00:47:34.540 position:21% line:83% align:start
It instructed me to
go to the movie theater

00:47:34.574 --> 00:47:36.275 position:16% line:89% align:start
where I first saw Dumbo.

00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:39.213 position:19% line:83% align:start
So I came to New York
and found the theater.

00:47:39.246 --> 00:47:42.116 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've been waiting ever
since for my mom to show up.

00:47:42.149 --> 00:47:43.250 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're doing what?!

00:47:43.283 --> 00:47:44.785 position:7% line:89% align:start
People usually go to see Dumbo

00:47:44.818 --> 00:47:46.587 position:7% line:89% align:start
with their mom's, don't they?

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:50.158 position:7% line:83% align:start
So I figured that random call
I got probably came from her.

00:47:50.191 --> 00:47:52.626 position:16% line:83% align:start
But after everything you
told me, I'm not sure.

00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:55.730 position:5% line:83% align:start
I mean, didn't you say I haven't
seen her since I was five?

00:47:55.764 --> 00:47:57.632 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mhmm.

00:47:57.665 --> 00:48:01.070 position:16% line:83% align:start
I guess that "concierge"
lady on the phone

00:48:01.103 --> 00:48:03.272 position:24% line:83% align:start
is taking care of
this room for me.

00:48:03.305 --> 00:48:04.073 position:10% line:89% align:start
But I don't remember seeing

00:48:04.106 --> 00:48:06.343 position:27% line:83% align:start
a request for a
room on your log.

00:48:06.376 --> 00:48:08.211 position:38% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:48:14.851 --> 00:48:15.685 position:19% line:89% align:start
"Given the situation,

00:48:15.719 --> 00:48:17.587 position:24% line:83% align:start
it's too dangerous
to come back yet."

00:48:17.621 --> 00:48:19.790 position:24% line:83% align:start
"You and Takizawa
hide out in the U.S.

00:48:19.823 --> 00:48:21.591 position:16% line:89% align:start
until the dust settles.

00:48:21.625 --> 00:48:23.094 position:10% line:89% align:start
We'll back you up from here.

00:48:23.127 --> 00:48:25.763 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wait for us to call
before you move."

00:48:25.797 --> 00:48:26.998 position:13% line:89% align:start
What do they mean by that?

00:48:27.031 --> 00:48:29.835 position:10% line:83% align:start
Your request to become king
is complicating things a bit.

00:48:29.868 --> 00:48:32.137 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's no way you can go
home without being noticed.

00:48:32.171 --> 00:48:34.807 position:10% line:83% align:start
You'll not only be the Prime
Minister's illegitimate son,

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:37.042 position:21% line:83% align:start
but the main suspect
in the missile attack!

00:48:37.077 --> 00:48:38.677 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey, here's an idea.

00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:40.646 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why don't I see if
I can cancel that request?

00:48:40.679 --> 00:48:42.315 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's gotta be
worth a try, right?

00:48:42.348 --> 00:48:43.817 position:41% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:48:45.352 --> 00:48:46.986 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hello, Juiz speaking.

00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:47.988 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, hello?

00:48:48.022 --> 00:48:49.390 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's been such a long time!

00:48:49.423 --> 00:48:51.659 position:27% line:83% align:start
I haven't heard
from you since I called

00:48:51.692 --> 00:48:53.961 position:16% line:83% align:start
the police station while
I was having you released.

00:48:53.994 --> 00:48:56.164 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh! So that was you.

00:48:56.198 --> 00:48:59.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
Funny story: I actually
thought that you were my mom.

00:48:59.201 --> 00:49:01.236 position:10% line:89% align:start
Since you're back in touch,'

00:49:01.269 --> 00:49:02.938 position:19% line:83% align:start
I take it everything's
been going well

00:49:02.971 --> 00:49:04.373 position:19% line:89% align:start
these past few months?

00:49:04.407 --> 00:49:05.774 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's good to hear!

00:49:05.807 --> 00:49:06.476 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, well.

00:49:06.509 --> 00:49:09.145 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh. I had a question about that.

00:49:09.178 --> 00:49:10.246 position:24% line:83% align:start
I was wondering if
it would be possible

00:49:10.279 --> 00:49:13.116 position:19% line:83% align:start
to cancel that request
to become king.

00:49:13.149 --> 00:49:14.117 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?

00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:18.188 position:16% line:83% align:start
But I thought you'd make
such a splendid king!

00:49:18.222 --> 00:49:19.189 position:30% line:89% align:start
I must admit,

00:49:19.223 --> 00:49:21.391 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm a bit disappointed
about this, Number 9.

00:49:21.425 --> 00:49:22.226 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow.

00:49:22.259 --> 00:49:23.760 position:21% line:89% align:start
Thank you, I guess.

00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:26.397 position:13% line:83% align:start
It is technically possible
to cancel the order,

00:49:26.431 --> 00:49:27.899 position:10% line:89% align:start
but if you choose to do so,

00:49:27.932 --> 00:49:30.768 position:21% line:83% align:start
things will remain-
as they are- at present.

00:49:30.802 --> 00:49:32.937 position:10% line:83% align:start
Do you still wish to proceed
with the cancellation?

00:49:32.971 --> 00:49:34.273 position:24% line:89% align:start
Nothing'll change?

00:49:34.306 --> 00:49:37.443 position:5% line:89% align:start
That isn't going to help anyone.

00:49:37.476 --> 00:49:41.113 position:10% line:83% align:start
Even if it doesn't, I still
think you should cancel it.

00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:45.252 position:21% line:83% align:start
Can I have a little
time to think it over?

00:49:45.285 --> 00:49:46.219 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:49:46.253 --> 00:49:49.289 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, of course. Noblesse oblige.

00:49:49.322 --> 00:49:50.323 position:16% line:89% align:start
I pray that you continue

00:49:50.357 --> 00:49:55.028 position:13% line:83% align:start
to be a successful prince,
er, rather, savior.

00:49:55.062 --> 00:49:56.164 position:27% line:89% align:start
Why not cancel?

00:49:56.197 --> 00:49:58.332 position:30% line:83% align:start
Well, I figure
I've come this far,

00:49:58.366 --> 00:50:00.768 position:21% line:83% align:start
so I should probably
see it through.

00:50:00.801 --> 00:50:03.838 position:24% line:89% align:start
You sure? Really?

00:50:12.881 --> 00:50:14.783 position:30% line:83% align:start
I can't really
blame Mrs. Iinuma.

00:50:14.816 --> 00:50:17.253 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'd feel the same
way in her position.

00:50:26.397 --> 00:50:29.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
Dear. As expected,
yet another unusual request

00:50:29.066 --> 00:50:32.836 position:30% line:89% align:start
from Number 6.

00:50:36.841 --> 00:50:39.811 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wonder if Number 9
knows what he's up to.

00:50:45.184 --> 00:50:46.752 position:5% line:89% align:start
We don't have to eat that stuff.

00:50:46.786 --> 00:50:48.221 position:5% line:89% align:start
We do have other food, you know.

00:50:48.254 --> 00:50:49.989 position:27% line:83% align:start
What happened to
your NEET spirit?

00:50:50.022 --> 00:50:53.293 position:5% line:83% align:start
Life isn't all about fancy food
and nice things, you know.

00:50:53.327 --> 00:50:54.294 position:30% line:89% align:start
This from you?

00:50:54.328 --> 00:50:56.296 position:19% line:83% align:start
The same guy who could
barely leave his house

00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:57.531 position:30% line:83% align:start
for two years
because he was living

00:50:57.564 --> 00:50:59.900 position:24% line:83% align:start
on an allowance he
got from his parents.

00:50:59.933 --> 00:51:01.068 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't you get it, man?

00:51:01.101 --> 00:51:03.271 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's what being
a NEET is about.

00:51:06.541 --> 00:51:08.109 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's easy for you to say.

00:51:08.142 --> 00:51:09.545 position:19% line:83% align:start
You've had a good time
of it as a NEET

00:51:09.578 --> 00:51:11.879 position:24% line:83% align:start
so far since your
parents are well off,

00:51:11.913 --> 00:51:14.383 position:21% line:83% align:start
but that isn't gonna
last much longer.

00:51:14.416 --> 00:51:17.253 position:7% line:83% align:start
It sounds like the changes in
the tax laws are going through.

00:51:18.887 --> 00:51:19.723 position:7% line:89% align:start
Like the one that's gonna push

00:51:19.755 --> 00:51:22.225 position:27% line:83% align:start
the death tax up
to a hundred percent?

00:51:22.259 --> 00:51:24.227 position:10% line:83% align:start
This country gets threatened
with a missile attack,

00:51:24.261 --> 00:51:26.529 position:24% line:83% align:start
and we're the ones
who end up payin'.

00:51:26.563 --> 00:51:27.530 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's nuts.

00:51:27.565 --> 00:51:30.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
How can such a crazy law
possibly pass so easily?

00:51:30.867 --> 00:51:32.436 position:27% line:83% align:start
The youth don't
take it seriously

00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:34.138 position:27% line:83% align:start
since they have
nothing to pass on.

00:51:34.171 --> 00:51:36.574 position:7% line:83% align:start
Instead, they see it as a way
of leveling the playing field

00:51:36.607 --> 00:51:39.877 position:10% line:83% align:start
by taxing the rich, but most
older folks have already started

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:43.148 position:16% line:83% align:start
depleting their savings
so they can avoid the tax.

00:51:43.181 --> 00:51:44.182 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, it's true.

00:51:44.216 --> 00:51:46.151 position:10% line:89% align:start
Even my old man's doing it.

00:51:46.184 --> 00:51:47.319 position:10% line:89% align:start
He intends to make damn sure

00:51:47.352 --> 00:51:49.389 position:30% line:83% align:start
that he's not
leaving me anything.

00:51:49.422 --> 00:51:52.091 position:21% line:83% align:start
The law's supporters
say it'll be a stimulus

00:51:52.125 --> 00:51:54.227 position:27% line:83% align:start
to speed up the
economy's recovery.

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:56.462 position:16% line:83% align:start
But if you ask me, what
they're really trying to do

00:51:56.496 --> 00:51:59.232 position:13% line:83% align:start
is stick it to the NEETs,
and from the sound of it,

00:51:59.265 --> 00:52:02.936 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hirasawa, your father is
playing right into their plans.

00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:04.405 position:16% line:89% align:start
A stimulus? Oh, please!

00:52:04.438 --> 00:52:07.041 position:19% line:83% align:start
What they're doing is
stealing the taxpayers' money.

00:52:07.074 --> 00:52:09.511 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why can't the government
get anything right?

00:52:13.615 --> 00:52:14.582 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey, check your phone.

00:52:14.616 --> 00:52:17.118 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't think you hung
up after the last call.

00:52:17.152 --> 00:52:18.153 position:16% line:89% align:start
That doesn't make sense.

00:52:18.186 --> 00:52:20.256 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'll get it for you.

00:52:25.461 --> 00:52:27.497 position:21% line:83% align:start
Looks like Number 6
just made a move.

00:52:42.513 --> 00:52:45.350 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's hot! Why did
this thing turn itself on?

00:52:52.691 --> 00:52:54.259 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yes, hello?

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:56.261 position:35% line:89% align:start
Number 9?

00:52:57.963 --> 00:52:59.466 position:19% line:89% align:start
Who's asking for 'im?

00:52:59.499 --> 00:53:02.001 position:27% line:83% align:start
You really don't
remember me, do you?

00:53:02.035 --> 00:53:02.569 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:53:02.602 --> 00:53:03.671 position:41% line:89% align:start
Well.

00:53:03.704 --> 00:53:06.039 position:10% line:83% align:start
I only called to see if you
were in the shower yet.

00:53:06.072 --> 00:53:09.310 position:5% line:89% align:start
What? That came out of nowhere.

00:53:09.343 --> 00:53:11.512 position:16% line:89% align:start
A 'yes' or 'no' will do.

00:53:11.545 --> 00:53:15.983 position:10% line:89% align:start
Okay. No, not at the moment.

00:53:16.016 --> 00:53:19.053 position:16% line:83% align:start
I suggest you check your
cell phone immediately.

00:53:23.558 --> 00:53:24.426 position:33% line:89% align:start
Who's that?

00:53:24.459 --> 00:53:26.094 position:35% line:89% align:start
Beats me.

00:53:36.139 --> 00:53:38.007 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's good stuff.

00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:41.211 position:16% line:83% align:start
Small explosions always
play more realistic on film.

00:53:41.245 --> 00:53:44.448 position:19% line:83% align:start
This is right up there
with Spielberg's Munich.

00:53:53.324 --> 00:53:55.661 position:38% line:83% align:start
No way!
They got out of the building?!

00:53:57.496 --> 00:53:58.697 position:19% line:89% align:start
Juiz, what the hell?!

00:53:58.731 --> 00:54:00.733 position:19% line:83% align:start
I told you! All great
movies have a sce---

00:54:00.766 --> 00:54:03.269 position:13% line:83% align:start
My research hasn't turned
up a single classic movie

00:54:03.302 --> 00:54:06.071 position:16% line:83% align:start
that ends with the leads
being blown up in a bathroom.

00:54:06.105 --> 00:54:10.243 position:27% line:83% align:start
That was my own
personal touch, thank you.

00:54:10.277 --> 00:54:12.012 position:24% line:83% align:start
Fine, I'll let it
slide this time,

00:54:12.045 --> 00:54:14.047 position:7% line:89% align:start
just get them for me, will ya?

00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:15.383 position:27% line:89% align:start
Request denied.

00:54:15.416 --> 00:54:17.251 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're outside
the effective range.

00:54:17.285 --> 00:54:19.487 position:21% line:83% align:start
I cannot pursue them
in a timely manner.

00:54:21.155 --> 00:54:22.691 position:27% line:89% align:start
Why, you little-

00:54:30.399 --> 00:54:32.201 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yeah. Don't worry. We're fine.

00:54:32.234 --> 00:54:34.136 position:16% line:83% align:start
Someone warned Takizawa
about the bomb,

00:54:34.169 --> 00:54:37.073 position:10% line:83% align:start
and we were able to get out
of the building just in time.

00:54:37.106 --> 00:54:39.409 position:7% line:89% align:start
A warning? Who'd it come from?

00:54:39.442 --> 00:54:41.612 position:27% line:89% align:start
I have no idea.

00:54:43.346 --> 00:54:44.582 position:24% line:83% align:start
In any case, we'll
come up with a way

00:54:44.615 --> 00:54:46.784 position:5% line:89% align:start
to wire you some money tomorrow.

00:54:46.817 --> 00:54:48.719 position:27% line:83% align:start
Take it and then
get out of New York.

00:54:48.752 --> 00:54:50.387 position:24% line:89% align:start
Right, thank you.

00:54:50.421 --> 00:54:51.355 position:33% line:89% align:start
So what now?

00:54:51.388 --> 00:54:53.592 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do you have a place
to hide until then?

00:54:53.625 --> 00:54:54.291 position:13% line:89% align:start
We're headed for the place

00:54:54.326 --> 00:54:56.495 position:5% line:89% align:start
where Takizawa works right now.

00:54:56.528 --> 00:54:58.296 position:19% line:89% align:start
He says he has a key.

00:55:27.128 --> 00:55:31.099 position:7% line:83% align:start
So, this is the theater where
I saw Dumbo the first time.

00:55:31.132 --> 00:55:32.735 position:10% line:89% align:start
That wasn't a lot to go on.

00:55:32.768 --> 00:55:34.737 position:16% line:89% align:start
But you still found it.

00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:37.673 position:10% line:89% align:start
Crazy, huh. Here, take this.

00:55:37.706 --> 00:55:40.476 position:19% line:83% align:start
They always crank the
AC up way too high in here.

00:55:40.509 --> 00:55:41.745 position:21% line:89% align:start
But what about you?

00:55:41.778 --> 00:55:43.178 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna keep watch.

00:55:43.212 --> 00:55:44.781 position:27% line:83% align:start
It'd be bad news
if someone finds us.

00:55:44.814 --> 00:55:46.716 position:24% line:83% align:start
Shout if you need
anything, okay?

00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:48.351 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hold on!

00:55:52.322 --> 00:55:54.792 position:13% line:89% align:start
Are you gonna leave again?

00:56:04.736 --> 00:56:06.371 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hey. Do you know
what I was doing

00:56:06.405 --> 00:56:08.407 position:19% line:89% align:start
out in Brooklyn today?

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:09.709 position:35% line:89% align:start
No. What?

00:56:09.742 --> 00:56:11.611 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've lost almost all
of my memories,

00:56:11.644 --> 00:56:14.581 position:10% line:83% align:start
except for the ones that're
associated with movies.

00:56:14.614 --> 00:56:16.416 position:10% line:89% align:start
For some reason those stuck.

00:56:16.449 --> 00:56:19.319 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's probably why I was
able to find this place.

00:56:19.352 --> 00:56:22.121 position:19% line:83% align:start
But there's this one,
a movie I can't seem

00:56:22.155 --> 00:56:23.891 position:30% line:83% align:start
to remember no
matter how hard I try.

00:56:23.924 --> 00:56:25.259 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's about this couple that gets

00:56:25.292 --> 00:56:27.294 position:19% line:83% align:start
temporarily separated
from each other,

00:56:27.328 --> 00:56:29.129 position:13% line:83% align:start
but they took a picture of
themselves in the middle

00:56:29.163 --> 00:56:32.132 position:16% line:83% align:start
of 9/11 with Ground Zero
in the background.

00:56:32.166 --> 00:56:33.501 position:7% line:89% align:start
That picture becomes the clue

00:56:33.535 --> 00:56:37.172 position:19% line:83% align:start
that ultimately brings
them back together.

00:56:37.205 --> 00:56:38.306 position:7% line:89% align:start
I was so desperate to remember

00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:42.511 position:16% line:83% align:start
the movie's title that I
visited Ground Zero every day,

00:56:42.545 --> 00:56:43.579 position:21% line:89% align:start
but now you're here,

00:56:43.613 --> 00:56:46.248 position:13% line:83% align:start
and it turns out it wasn't
a scene from a movie.

00:57:14.647 --> 00:57:16.582 position:24% line:83% align:start
Wow, you mean you
can actually hack into

00:57:16.615 --> 00:57:18.785 position:24% line:83% align:start
all those peoples'
personal networks?

00:57:18.818 --> 00:57:20.520 position:30% line:83% align:start
Shouldn't you
be careful snooping

00:57:20.553 --> 00:57:21.888 position:30% line:83% align:start
into business
and school records?

00:57:21.921 --> 00:57:23.490 position:5% line:89% align:start
That'll get you in big trouble.

00:57:23.523 --> 00:57:25.760 position:24% line:83% align:start
Little late to be
worrying about that now.

00:57:25.793 --> 00:57:26.794 position:16% line:89% align:start
We're runnin' outa time.

00:57:26.827 --> 00:57:27.628 position:10% line:89% align:start
We need all the information

00:57:27.662 --> 00:57:30.196 position:27% line:83% align:start
that we can get
on him, and quickly.

00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:31.766 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, I found something!

00:57:39.741 --> 00:57:41.943 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now I get why we
couldn't find his data.

00:57:41.977 --> 00:57:43.845 position:10% line:89% align:start
Damn Juiz. This is her work.

00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:47.215 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's erasing all of the "Akira
Takizawa" info on the net,

00:57:47.249 --> 00:57:50.319 position:19% line:83% align:start
and replacing it with
"Akira Iinuma."

00:57:50.353 --> 00:57:51.287 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, Micchon!

00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:53.723 position:19% line:83% align:start
Did Number 9 send out
that order himself?

00:57:53.756 --> 00:57:56.325 position:16% line:83% align:start
It doesn't say anything
like that in the logs.

00:57:59.296 --> 00:57:59.963 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's gone?!

00:57:59.997 --> 00:58:00.964 position:19% line:89% align:start
So she's erasing more

00:58:00.998 --> 00:58:03.467 position:19% line:83% align:start
than Akira Takizawa's
history on the internet.

00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:05.704 position:16% line:83% align:start
She's also deleting all
the names in his log.

00:58:05.737 --> 00:58:06.705 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's crazy!

00:58:06.738 --> 00:58:08.840 position:19% line:83% align:start
You mean Juiz has been
making data disappear

00:58:08.873 --> 00:58:11.409 position:24% line:83% align:start
all this time and
we haven't noticed it?

00:58:11.443 --> 00:58:13.244 position:7% line:89% align:start
Eh, don't have a heart attack.

00:58:13.278 --> 00:58:16.347 position:16% line:83% align:start
I made a plan B in case
this kinda thing happened.

00:58:16.381 --> 00:58:17.750 position:24% line:83% align:start
I worked it out so
the phone's activity

00:58:17.783 --> 00:58:20.786 position:21% line:83% align:start
is copied to my PC,
where it's saved.

00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:22.321 position:21% line:89% align:start
You are so awesome!

00:58:22.354 --> 00:58:26.225 position:33% line:83% align:start
Aw, stop it.
You're making me blush!

00:58:29.563 --> 00:58:30.530 position:33% line:89% align:start
 Impossible!

00:58:30.564 --> 00:58:33.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
A firewall that's got
the ability to attack?

00:58:33.034 --> 00:58:36.403 position:19% line:83% align:start
What is this? You ever
seen anything like it?

00:58:36.436 --> 00:58:40.842 position:10% line:83% align:start
Micchon, try scrolling back
through Takky's detail log.

00:58:40.875 --> 00:58:43.846 position:16% line:89% align:start
Stop right there. Look.

00:58:43.879 --> 00:58:45.013 position:27% line:89% align:start
 Yeah, I see it.

00:58:45.047 --> 00:58:48.517 position:10% line:83% align:start
"Hack into Eden of the East
and use the image system."

00:58:48.550 --> 00:58:50.385 position:7% line:89% align:start
Your plan backfired, Panties!

00:58:50.419 --> 00:58:52.588 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now Juiz can use Eden
for her own purposes

00:58:52.621 --> 00:58:54.456 position:21% line:83% align:start
since you beefed up
the search engine!

00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:57.427 position:10% line:89% align:start
She's usin' it?! That bitch!

00:58:57.460 --> 00:58:58.595 position:7% line:89% align:start
At this rate, it won't be long

00:58:58.628 --> 00:59:02.465 position:10% line:83% align:start
before Akira Iinuma replaces
Akira Takizawa completely.

00:59:28.427 --> 00:59:29.796 position:10% line:89% align:start
They're called roving bugs.

00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:32.365 position:16% line:83% align:start
They're used to control
cell phones remotely.

00:59:32.398 --> 00:59:35.636 position:7% line:83% align:start
With these, you can listen in
on surrounding conversations.

00:59:35.669 --> 00:59:39.073 position:10% line:83% align:start
From what I hear, FBI types
use these things all the time.

00:59:39.107 --> 00:59:41.341 position:13% line:89% align:start
Is a Seleção behind this?

00:59:41.375 --> 00:59:44.846 position:10% line:89% align:start
No clue. What do you think?

00:59:44.879 --> 00:59:46.548 position:10% line:89% align:start
Is it one of them, Micchon?

00:59:46.581 --> 00:59:49.018 position:21% line:83% align:start
Probably. It's here,
in Number 1's log.

00:59:49.051 --> 00:59:52.620 position:7% line:83% align:start
"Have Public Security Division
investigate Eden of the East."

00:59:52.655 --> 00:59:54.657 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's four-eyes again?!

00:59:56.025 --> 00:59:57.626 position:10% line:89% align:start
What is he up to this time?

00:59:57.660 --> 01:00:00.396 position:27% line:83% align:start
And what does it
have to do with Eden?

01:00:18.683 --> 01:00:20.585 position:35% line:89% align:start
Takizawa?!

01:00:27.492 --> 01:00:28.928 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, what's wrong?

01:00:31.764 --> 01:00:34.400 position:13% line:83% align:start
Don't tell me you thought
I'd taken off again.

01:00:44.812 --> 01:00:46.513 position:21% line:89% align:start
I know this poster.

01:00:46.547 --> 01:00:49.516 position:19% line:83% align:start
You had it hanging up
in your theater, too.

01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:51.653 position:19% line:83% align:start
I guess it musta been
really important to me

01:00:51.686 --> 01:00:54.689 position:10% line:83% align:start
at some point for it to keep
on popping up like that.

01:00:57.659 --> 01:00:58.961 position:30% line:89% align:start
So, what now?

01:00:58.995 --> 01:01:00.763 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm betting it's still
gonna be quite a while

01:01:00.796 --> 01:01:03.199 position:19% line:83% align:start
before the money comes
in from your friends.

01:01:03.232 --> 01:01:06.736 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've got enough cash for us
to take the bus to Chinatown.

01:01:06.769 --> 01:01:08.138 position:27% line:89% align:start
I have an idea.

01:01:08.171 --> 01:01:10.641 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why don't we take a walk
and explore the city?

01:01:10.674 --> 01:01:11.875 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wait, explore?

01:01:11.909 --> 01:01:13.010 position:38% line:89% align:start
Why not?

01:01:13.043 --> 01:01:14.778 position:24% line:83% align:start
This neighborhood
is familiar to me,

01:01:14.811 --> 01:01:16.847 position:21% line:83% align:start
like I lived here as
a kid or something.

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:18.883 position:13% line:83% align:start
Plus, there are still some
things I need to know.

01:01:18.917 --> 01:01:21.920 position:13% line:89% align:start
Some things about my past.

01:01:21.953 --> 01:01:25.957 position:13% line:83% align:start
I want proof of who I was
before he's gone for good.

01:01:27.192 --> 01:01:28.726 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well I can think of one thing.

01:01:28.761 --> 01:01:29.962 position:27% line:83% align:start
Before you left,
you said something odd

01:01:29.995 --> 01:01:32.498 position:24% line:83% align:start
about there being
no "gold ring."

01:01:32.531 --> 01:01:34.466 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think that's where
we should start.

01:01:41.107 --> 01:01:42.742 position:30% line:89% align:start
Juiz speaking.

01:01:42.776 --> 01:01:44.544 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yo, No-obli.

01:01:44.577 --> 01:01:46.047 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm up to something interesting.

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:47.248 position:27% line:89% align:start
You wanna hear?

01:01:47.281 --> 01:01:48.983 position:16% line:89% align:start
Certainly. I'd love to.

01:01:49.016 --> 01:01:50.117 position:21% line:89% align:start
How's this headline:

01:01:50.151 --> 01:01:52.987 position:13% line:83% align:start
"Late Prime Minister's Son
is the Missile Terrorist."

01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:56.091 position:5% line:83% align:start
That should cause a good amount
of chaos, don't you think?

01:01:56.124 --> 01:01:59.493 position:13% line:83% align:start
Unfortunately, it won't be
enough to save the country.

01:01:59.527 --> 01:02:01.263 position:16% line:83% align:start
To do that, we're gonna
have to go further.

01:02:01.296 --> 01:02:02.564 position:19% line:89% align:start
We find a way to make

01:02:02.597 --> 01:02:04.599 position:21% line:83% align:start
all Japan's citizens
feel victimized.

01:02:04.633 --> 01:02:06.002 position:27% line:83% align:start
They need to be
motivated to stand up

01:02:06.035 --> 01:02:08.004 position:10% line:89% align:start
and bitch at other nations.

01:02:08.037 --> 01:02:10.073 position:13% line:89% align:start
Are you feeling me, Juiz?

01:02:10.106 --> 01:02:12.575 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yes, I feel you, 2G.

01:02:12.608 --> 01:02:15.112 position:16% line:83% align:start
These days, the victim's
the one with all the power.

01:02:15.145 --> 01:02:17.915 position:10% line:83% align:start
Think about it: We live in a
time where all you have to do

01:02:17.948 --> 01:02:19.550 position:10% line:89% align:start
is spill coffee on yourself

01:02:19.583 --> 01:02:21.785 position:27% line:83% align:start
and you can sue
for pain and suffering.

01:02:21.819 --> 01:02:23.988 position:19% line:83% align:start
So I say we buy us one
of those victim tickets

01:02:24.021 --> 01:02:26.191 position:21% line:83% align:start
and hop on the train
with the rest of 'em.

01:02:26.224 --> 01:02:28.126 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'd hate to waste
the NEETs' sit-in.

01:02:28.159 --> 01:02:30.996 position:13% line:83% align:start
Let's orchestrate a nice,
painless destruction.

01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:33.798 position:5% line:89% align:start
Magnificent, 2G! Truly inspired.

01:02:33.832 --> 01:02:35.868 position:30% line:89% align:start
I know, right?

01:02:35.901 --> 01:02:40.139 position:5% line:83% align:start
The Prime Minister's son returns
to Japan in an Air King T-shirt.

01:02:40.172 --> 01:02:42.041 position:27% line:83% align:start
The rest of Asia
promptly flips out

01:02:42.074 --> 01:02:43.642 position:27% line:83% align:start
because they're
afraid that we're going

01:02:43.676 --> 01:02:45.946 position:21% line:83% align:start
to turn militaristic
and nuke them.

01:02:45.979 --> 01:02:47.546 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then the Air King is gunned down

01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:49.783 position:19% line:83% align:start
by a foreigner shortly
after returning home,

01:02:49.816 --> 01:02:52.052 position:27% line:83% align:start
and from there,
it's a done deal.

01:02:52.085 --> 01:02:53.687 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yes, 2G.

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:57.325 position:7% line:83% align:start
I pray you shall always remain
a forward-thinking savior.

01:02:57.358 --> 01:03:01.763 position:19% line:83% align:start
But how do we get him
to wear the T-shirt?

01:03:25.022 --> 01:03:26.589 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's over there,
on the merry-go-round.

01:03:26.623 --> 01:03:29.026 position:10% line:83% align:start
I think that's the gold ring
you were talking about.

01:03:30.328 --> 01:03:33.031 position:7% line:83% align:start
I didn't know what you meant,
so I did some research.

01:03:33.065 --> 01:03:35.967 position:16% line:83% align:start
Japanese merry-go-rounds
don't have gold rings.

01:03:36.001 --> 01:03:39.604 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's what you noticed on the
day of the last missile attack.

01:03:39.638 --> 01:03:41.673 position:24% line:83% align:start
Apparently most of
the ones in the U.S.

01:03:41.706 --> 01:03:43.608 position:5% line:89% align:start
don't have them anymore, either.

01:03:43.642 --> 01:03:45.912 position:24% line:83% align:start
They did up until
around the late eighties,

01:03:45.945 --> 01:03:48.114 position:19% line:83% align:start
though, and sometimes,
you'll still find one.

01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:54.922 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're supposed to
try to grab the ring.

01:03:54.955 --> 01:03:57.825 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you catch it, you get an
extra ride on the carousel.

01:04:06.334 --> 01:04:07.802 position:24% line:89% align:start
That makes sense.

01:04:08.303 --> 01:04:10.306 position:21% line:83% align:start
I must've been here
sometime as a kid.

01:04:10.339 --> 01:04:12.908 position:16% line:83% align:start
That explains why I know
about the gold ring.

01:04:18.681 --> 01:04:20.749 position:21% line:89% align:start
That was a nice try.

01:04:31.862 --> 01:04:32.864 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's over already?

01:04:32.897 --> 01:04:33.865 position:27% line:89% align:start
That was quick.

01:04:33.898 --> 01:04:35.133 position:19% line:89% align:start
You take another spin.

01:04:35.166 --> 01:04:37.168 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll watch you ride
from right over there.

01:04:37.869 --> 01:04:39.770 position:16% line:89% align:start
When did you get that?!

01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:52.051 position:27% line:83% align:start
This place does
bring back memories.

01:04:52.085 --> 01:04:53.019 position:7% line:89% align:start
Mom was always sending me off

01:04:53.052 --> 01:04:56.322 position:24% line:83% align:start
to the theater to
watch shows by myself.

01:04:56.356 --> 01:04:58.325 position:21% line:83% align:start
So when she actually
took me somewhere else,

01:04:58.359 --> 01:05:01.428 position:5% line:89% align:start
like this park, I was ecstatic.

01:05:01.462 --> 01:05:03.831 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'd reach for that gold ring
with everything I had,

01:05:03.864 --> 01:05:07.302 position:16% line:83% align:start
hoping I'd never have to
get off the merry-go-round.

01:05:07.335 --> 01:05:09.803 position:19% line:83% align:start
And when I caught it,
I'd wave to her and shout,

01:05:09.837 --> 01:05:13.141 position:19% line:83% align:start
"Look, Mom, I did it!
I got the gold ring!"

01:05:19.047 --> 01:05:20.416 position:19% line:89% align:start
She'd be sitting here,

01:05:20.449 --> 01:05:23.452 position:21% line:83% align:start
just watching me go
'round and 'round again.

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:26.490 position:24% line:89% align:start
She hated movies.

01:05:26.523 --> 01:05:30.260 position:16% line:83% align:start
There was only one she'd
ever watch with me: Dumbo.

01:05:34.398 --> 01:05:35.732 position:5% line:89% align:start
You should come out of the rain.

01:05:35.766 --> 01:05:37.235 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're gonna get soaked!

01:05:37.268 --> 01:05:38.269 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about it.

01:05:38.303 --> 01:05:41.406 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'd rather watch you
from here, if that's okay.

01:05:46.911 --> 01:05:47.879 position:27% line:89% align:start
Target sighted.

01:05:47.912 --> 01:05:49.949 position:7% line:89% align:start
He's in front of the carousel.

01:05:58.491 --> 01:06:00.193 position:24% line:89% align:start
I finally got 'em.

01:06:00.227 --> 01:06:01.828 position:21% line:83% align:start
They better not have
gotten too friendly

01:06:01.861 --> 01:06:04.097 position:30% line:83% align:start
while I wasn't
there to film them.

01:06:14.476 --> 01:06:16.877 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, what's this?

01:06:20.182 --> 01:06:22.251 position:21% line:83% align:start
Thanks to you I was
able to get back some of

01:06:22.284 --> 01:06:25.153 position:21% line:83% align:start
my memories from the
time I spent in New York.

01:06:50.048 --> 01:06:51.816 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hurry up. Get in!

01:07:13.408 --> 01:07:14.241 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're the one
who called to warn me

01:07:14.275 --> 01:07:16.277 position:13% line:89% align:start
about the bomb yesterday?

01:07:16.311 --> 01:07:18.846 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yes. Prime Minister Iinuma's
wife wanted me

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.014 position:30% line:89% align:start
to fetch you.

01:07:20.048 --> 01:07:23.284 position:24% line:83% align:start
She insisted I use
the utmost secrecy.

01:07:24.386 --> 01:07:26.422 position:16% line:83% align:start
The other Seleção aren't
the only ones upset

01:07:26.455 --> 01:07:29.191 position:24% line:83% align:start
about your request
to become a king.

01:07:29.224 --> 01:07:32.061 position:10% line:83% align:start
Thanks to you, Mrs. Iinuma's
pride has been damaged

01:07:32.094 --> 01:07:34.264 position:24% line:83% align:start
and her husband's
good name sullied.

01:07:34.297 --> 01:07:36.899 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's no surprise
that she hates you.

01:07:36.933 --> 01:07:37.801 position:24% line:89% align:start
If she's that mad,

01:07:37.834 --> 01:07:40.070 position:24% line:83% align:start
why are you taking
Takizawa to see her?

01:07:40.103 --> 01:07:42.172 position:30% line:83% align:start
She'd like to
meet you in person.

01:07:42.205 --> 01:07:43.641 position:21% line:83% align:start
She wants to assess
your intentions

01:07:43.674 --> 01:07:46.243 position:16% line:83% align:start
regarding the leadership
of the country.

01:07:46.277 --> 01:07:48.546 position:13% line:89% align:start
As for me, I'd like to see

01:07:48.579 --> 01:07:51.450 position:24% line:83% align:start
what kind of king
you'd make of yourself.

01:08:03.929 --> 01:08:05.198 position:24% line:89% align:start
What do we do now?

01:08:05.231 --> 01:08:06.466 position:5% line:89% align:start
I erased the new search engine,

01:08:06.499 --> 01:08:08.368 position:27% line:83% align:start
but I don't know
how much it'll help.

01:08:10.604 --> 01:08:11.638 position:7% line:89% align:start
The next step is shutting down

01:08:11.672 --> 01:08:13.640 position:10% line:89% align:start
Eden of the East completely.

01:08:13.674 --> 01:08:16.443 position:7% line:83% align:start
At the very least, that should
buy us some more time.

01:08:16.477 --> 01:08:17.644 position:41% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

01:08:17.678 --> 01:08:20.414 position:24% line:83% align:start
Panties, how much
longer will that get us?

01:08:26.621 --> 01:08:29.558 position:13% line:83% align:start
It looks like we'll have a
little over forty-eight hours.

01:08:29.592 --> 01:08:31.627 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's a decent increase.

01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:34.096 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's good to see how
well our system works.

01:08:46.243 --> 01:08:47.210 position:24% line:89% align:start
Think about this.

01:08:47.244 --> 01:08:48.979 position:5% line:89% align:start
Eden's been growing so quickly.

01:08:49.012 --> 01:08:51.649 position:10% line:83% align:start
By now it's practically part
of the public infrastructure.

01:08:51.682 --> 01:08:52.350 position:21% line:89% align:start
If we shut it down,

01:08:52.383 --> 01:08:53.684 position:7% line:89% align:start
we'll be affecting a lot more

01:08:53.718 --> 01:08:56.053 position:5% line:89% align:start
than just twenty-thousand NEETs.

01:08:56.087 --> 01:08:59.157 position:19% line:89% align:start
I know. Well, Micchon?

01:08:59.190 --> 01:09:01.527 position:10% line:83% align:start
I switched over to the local
area network.

01:09:07.099 --> 01:09:09.502 position:13% line:89% align:start
Here we go. Goodbye, Eden.

01:09:19.212 --> 01:09:20.681 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's really shut down?

01:09:20.714 --> 01:09:21.715 position:41% line:89% align:start
Relax.

01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:22.850 position:10% line:83% align:start
I know you're the one who's
gonna have to deal

01:09:22.883 --> 01:09:25.686 position:5% line:83% align:start
with the ton of complaints we'll
be getting about this.

01:09:25.719 --> 01:09:28.155 position:10% line:83% align:start
But it's only temporary, so
don't freak out.

01:09:28.189 --> 01:09:29.156 position:13% line:89% align:start
But what about Hirasawa?!

01:09:29.190 --> 01:09:31.158 position:13% line:83% align:start
I mean he's spent so long
pouring his blood,

01:09:31.193 --> 01:09:33.562 position:27% line:83% align:start
sweat, and snot
into Eden of the East!

01:09:33.595 --> 01:09:35.731 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's 'tears', not 'snot'!

01:09:36.699 --> 01:09:37.533 position:35% line:89% align:start
And Saki?

01:09:37.567 --> 01:09:38.333 position:21% line:89% align:start
We can't support her

01:09:38.366 --> 01:09:40.101 position:24% line:83% align:start
and Takizawa with
the system down.

01:09:40.135 --> 01:09:43.172 position:13% line:89% align:start
What're we supposed to do?

01:09:43.206 --> 01:09:44.240 position:27% line:89% align:start
I have an idea.

01:09:44.273 --> 01:09:46.610 position:16% line:83% align:start
Our current location is
under strict surveillance,

01:09:46.643 --> 01:09:48.311 position:7% line:89% align:start
which limits our capabilities,

01:09:48.344 --> 01:09:50.714 position:24% line:83% align:start
so I propose that
we move headquarters.

01:09:50.747 --> 01:09:53.350 position:10% line:89% align:start
Where are we supposed to go?

01:09:53.383 --> 01:09:55.687 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sir, I have our
club room at the college

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:57.722 position:24% line:83% align:start
on reserve in case
of an emergency.

01:09:57.755 --> 01:09:59.491 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's not as nice
as the new place,

01:09:59.524 --> 01:10:01.992 position:27% line:83% align:start
but the old Eden
system is still there.

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:03.561 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's settled then.

01:10:03.595 --> 01:10:07.365 position:10% line:83% align:start
The club room's the perfect
place to help Vintage Boy from.

01:10:07.398 --> 01:10:10.336 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I think you're right.

01:10:12.638 --> 01:10:14.540 position:21% line:89% align:start
An email from Saki!

01:10:14.573 --> 01:10:16.442 position:19% line:83% align:start
It says "We're heading
for the airport.

01:10:16.475 --> 01:10:18.043 position:10% line:89% align:start
Sorry for the sudden notice,

01:10:18.077 --> 01:10:21.081 position:27% line:83% align:start
but Takizawa is
coming back to Japan."

01:10:21.114 --> 01:10:23.383 position:7% line:89% align:start
What the heck's she thinking?

01:10:31.292 --> 01:10:32.226 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sorry, sweetie.

01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:34.462 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid this is as
far as you can come.

01:10:44.206 --> 01:10:47.443 position:30% line:83% align:start
Hey. What does
this new log mean?

01:10:47.477 --> 01:10:49.579 position:5% line:89% align:start
Number 1 is launching a missile.

01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:53.516 position:41% line:89% align:start
Juiz?

01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:55.251 position:27% line:83% align:start
Get me a report
of what's happening

01:10:55.285 --> 01:10:57.588 position:24% line:83% align:start
at the coordinates
in Number 1's log.

01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:36.965 position:35% line:89% align:start
Now, Juiz.

01:11:36.998 --> 01:11:39.601 position:13% line:83% align:start
Launch the other missiles
as we previously discussed.

01:11:39.634 --> 01:11:44.439 position:13% line:89% align:start
Accepted. Noblesse oblige.

01:11:44.473 --> 01:11:46.308 position:27% line:83% align:start
I pray for your
continued success

01:11:46.342 --> 01:11:48.877 position:5% line:89% align:start
as a "raze and rebuild" savior.

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.569 position:7% line:89% align:start
My number's been blacked out.

01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:14.338 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, hello!

01:12:14.372 --> 01:12:16.908 position:10% line:89% align:start
Juiz! Can you hear me, Juiz?

01:12:20.646 --> 01:12:22.481 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mononobe has to be behind this.

01:12:22.514 --> 01:12:23.883 position:10% line:89% align:start
I wonder if he located Juiz

01:12:23.916 --> 01:12:25.885 position:27% line:83% align:start
and blew her up
with that missile.

01:12:28.621 --> 01:12:31.725 position:5% line:83% align:start
But at least half of my request
has already been accepted.

01:12:31.759 --> 01:12:32.726 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're too late.

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.795 position:19% line:83% align:start
Besides, Mr. Mononobe,
what you have planned

01:12:34.828 --> 01:12:36.864 position:7% line:89% align:start
isn't what this country wants.

01:12:46.307 --> 01:12:47.642 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yuki!

01:12:47.676 --> 01:12:50.713 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I thought you were
eliminated by the Supporter!

01:12:50.746 --> 01:12:54.517 position:5% line:89% align:start
Actually, I "eliminated" myself.

01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:55.818 position:7% line:89% align:start
I destroyed my Noblesse phone

01:12:55.851 --> 01:12:57.887 position:24% line:83% align:start
so I could get the
revenge I wanted.

01:13:20.612 --> 01:13:21.780 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hello, Juiz.

01:13:21.814 --> 01:13:23.348 position:27% line:83% align:start
I need you to do
something for me.

01:13:23.382 --> 01:13:24.450 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's urgent.

01:13:24.483 --> 01:13:25.784 position:33% line:89% align:start
What is it?

01:13:29.022 --> 01:13:30.522 position:7% line:89% align:start
Can you move the third trailer

01:13:30.556 --> 01:13:32.425 position:27% line:83% align:start
in the convoy to
the front of the line?

01:13:32.459 --> 01:13:34.394 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yes, of course.

01:13:34.427 --> 01:13:35.862 position:10% line:89% align:start
Then please do it. Quickly.

01:13:35.895 --> 01:13:39.599 position:13% line:89% align:start
Accepted! Noblesse Oblige.

01:13:39.632 --> 01:13:42.970 position:13% line:83% align:start
I pray you shall still be
my beautiful savior tomorrow.

01:13:59.055 --> 01:14:01.591 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hurry, Juiz. Please hurry.

01:14:20.812 --> 01:14:21.880 position:30% line:89% align:start
Just in time.

01:14:21.913 --> 01:14:24.783 position:10% line:83% align:start
You were the most brilliant
assistant I ever had.

01:14:24.816 --> 01:14:27.318 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thank you for everything, Juiz.

01:14:29.054 --> 01:14:30.623 position:19% line:89% align:start
This is it, Number 9.

01:14:30.656 --> 01:14:32.358 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're on your own now.

01:14:32.391 --> 01:14:34.860 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can't be your
guardian angel anymore.

01:14:35.561 --> 01:14:38.531 position:13% line:83% align:start
Number 1 will be wrapping
up the game any time now,

01:14:38.564 --> 01:14:41.635 position:27% line:83% align:start
but I've already
placed my bet on you.

01:14:43.804 --> 01:14:46.974 position:24% line:83% align:start
You will keep your
promise, won't you?

01:14:47.008 --> 01:14:48.676 position:30% line:89% align:start
What promise?

01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:50.745 position:27% line:83% align:start
I pray you never
forget your true self

01:14:50.778 --> 01:14:52.680 position:24% line:89% align:start
when you are king.

01:14:54.415 --> 01:14:55.383 position:21% line:89% align:start
What are you doing?

01:14:55.416 --> 01:14:56.251 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:14:56.285 --> 01:14:58.486 position:30% line:83% align:start
Go to him. He
needs somebody's help.

01:14:58.519 --> 01:15:00.722 position:16% line:89% align:start
I've done all I can do.

01:15:07.496 --> 01:15:09.065 position:24% line:89% align:start
Thank you, Kuroha.

01:15:14.104 --> 01:15:17.741 position:19% line:83% align:start
All right, well, it's
about time to go home.

01:15:39.966 --> 01:15:41.901 position:21% line:89% align:start
Ato is so difficult.

01:15:41.934 --> 01:15:43.103 position:30% line:83% align:start
If the public
finds out about it,

01:15:43.136 --> 01:15:47.007 position:7% line:83% align:start
the political fallout will be
the least of our problems.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:47.941 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes, sir.

01:15:47.975 --> 01:15:49.676 position:24% line:83% align:start
The repercussions
would be quite severe.

01:15:49.710 --> 01:15:50.577 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's one of the reasons

01:15:50.611 --> 01:15:53.413 position:21% line:83% align:start
we need to sacrifice
Mr. Iinuma's son.

01:15:53.447 --> 01:15:54.681 position:16% line:89% align:start
You've proved your worth

01:15:54.715 --> 01:15:57.051 position:24% line:83% align:start
before by stopping
those sixty missiles.

I have every confidence

01:15:58.052 --> 01:16:00.822 position:21% line:83% align:start
that you can handle
this situation neatly.

01:16:00.855 --> 01:16:02.958 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's been sixty-five
years since the war.

01:16:02.992 --> 01:16:05.895 position:7% line:83% align:start
All that time, we've let other
countries call the shots for us.

01:16:05.928 --> 01:16:07.463 position:16% line:89% align:start
I will break Japan free

01:16:07.496 --> 01:16:09.164 position:5% line:89% align:start
from that culture of dependence.

01:16:09.198 --> 01:16:11.500 position:24% line:83% align:start
You have a talent
for gathering information

01:16:11.533 --> 01:16:14.204 position:13% line:83% align:start
and intimate knowledge of
the bureaucratic machine.

01:16:14.237 --> 01:16:15.338 position:19% line:89% align:start
With you on our side,

01:16:15.372 --> 01:16:19.209 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can almost see the old
Ministry rising back into power.

01:16:19.243 --> 01:16:22.046 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll even say "uncle"
again if I have to.
