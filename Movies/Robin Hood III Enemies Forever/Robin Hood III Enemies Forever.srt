Please don't apologize, Baron.

We're glad to see you back.

My brother, Richard, went to fight the Crusades.

1229

But he never returned.

1230

We have no news on him.

1231

I am most anxious.

Why, thank you, Baron.

There is hope that my brother is in England.

1235

And it is this that keeps me traveling in search of him.

Until he is found, I will rule as King of England.

Baron, I am very worried about my brother.

1240

01:14:06,784 --> 01:14:09,706

My dear, Baron, you really are splendidly bad.
