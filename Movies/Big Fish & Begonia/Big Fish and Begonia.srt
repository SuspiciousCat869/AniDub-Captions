1
00:00:56,633 --> 00:00:59,852
Some fish can never be caught

2
00:01:00,582 --> 00:01:02,774
because they belong to the sky.

3
00:01:26,926 --> 00:01:28,442
Who we are?

4
00:01:29,082 --> 00:01:30,943
Where do we come from?

5
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:33,953
And where are we going?

6
00:01:35,703 --> 00:01:39,007
No one thinks about these questions.

7
00:01:39,715 --> 00:01:41,136
We go to work.

8
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:44,322
Day in and day out,

9
00:01:44,798 --> 00:01:48,143
we laugh, we complain,

10
00:01:48,393 --> 00:01:50,393
we buy things,

11
00:01:50,741 --> 00:01:54,705
we eat, and we sleep.

12
00:01:56,312 --> 00:02:00,506
Somehow a century has already gone by.

13
00:02:00,894 --> 00:02:05,710
I am 117 years old now.

14
00:02:06,088 --> 00:02:07,864
As I often tell people,

15
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:12,184
the legend says that mankind came from the ocean,

16
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,673
and that when our life's journey as
human beings on this earth is done,

17
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:23,949
our souls return to the sea as beautiful fish.

18
00:02:26,008 --> 00:02:29,655
No one believes me when I tell this story.

19
00:02:29,885 --> 00:02:32,278
They call me an old fool.

20
00:02:32,532 --> 00:02:35,315
But I know it's true.

21
00:02:35,693 --> 00:02:41,778
I can see them in my dreams, giant
fish swimming down from the sky.

22
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:44,824
I can hear them calling out to me

23
00:02:45,244 --> 00:02:51,373
and their lovely voices awaken my memories.

24
00:02:58,914 --> 00:03:02,554
Long, long ago, when the Earth was young,

25
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:09,273
all that existed was a vast ocean and
the great primordial fish that lived in it.

26
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:14,817
These ancients were the first
incarnations of the human soul.

27
00:03:15,002 --> 00:03:18,531
That's why, from the moment we're born,

28
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:21,001
the ocean calls to us

29
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:24,338
and eventually we return to it.

30
00:03:25,332 --> 00:03:27,166
My name is Chun.

31
00:03:27,325 --> 00:03:30,249
I come from a world beneath the ocean.

32
00:03:30,749 --> 00:03:36,079
The sky of our world is connected
to the oceans of the human world.

33
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,384
Once freed by death,

34
00:03:38,575 --> 00:03:42,944
human souls drift down from their world to ours

35
00:03:43,118 --> 00:03:48,433
and it is our task to look after them and keep them safe.

36
00:03:48,822 --> 00:03:51,597
We are the ones who control time,

37
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:55,386
the tides, and the changing of the seasons.

38
00:03:55,728 --> 00:03:59,623
We are not human beings but neither are we gods.

39
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:02,521
We are The Others.

40
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:40,806
Look! Sister Leizu's woven a new sky for the humans.

41
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:44,429
Hurry, Chun. The Rite of Passage is about to begin.

42
00:04:44,694 --> 00:04:46,444
We'll hurry, Chisongzi!

43
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,109
Sister Leizu!

44
00:04:48,537 --> 00:04:50,515
I need to join the Rite of Passage.

45
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:52,095
Can we borrow two horses?

46
00:04:52,381 --> 00:04:54,341
I don't mind if the horses don't.

47
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,164
I'll take this one.

48
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,591
Of course!

49
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,542
You like 'em big and strong, don't you?

50
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,886
That's why you like...

51
00:05:06,111 --> 00:05:07,682
Wait for me!

52
00:05:08,987 --> 00:05:10,384
Wait up, Chun!

53
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:12,204
No way!

54
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:14,501
Oh, yeah?

55
00:05:14,818 --> 00:05:17,412
Qiu, tell me about the human world!

56
00:05:17,535 --> 00:05:18,643
I loved it there.

57
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:20,311
I almost didn't want to come back.

58
00:05:20,438 --> 00:05:21,939
Maybe you shouldn't have!

59
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:26,668
Then who would keep you out of trouble?

60
00:05:26,854 --> 00:05:29,360
You're the one who's in trouble, slowpoke!

61
00:05:44,504 --> 00:05:46,674
The Rite of Passage is starting! Hurry!

62
00:05:46,828 --> 00:05:48,538
Let's go, come on!

63
00:05:50,756 --> 00:05:52,881
I can't believe it's finally here.

64
00:05:53,382 --> 00:05:56,931
Now you be careful in the human world.

65
00:05:56,996 --> 00:05:57,798
I will.

66
00:05:59,227 --> 00:06:02,507
Chun! Over here!

67
00:06:03,046 --> 00:06:04,272
Coming, Mother!

68
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:09,110
Hey!

69
00:06:12,549 --> 00:06:15,106
Yeah! Looking good, Grandma!

70
00:06:15,663 --> 00:06:19,411
The seasons pass before us all,

71
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:25,189
Earth and Heaven, Moon and Sun, tied by the elements.

72
00:06:25,348 --> 00:06:28,445
You'll be all on your own up there in the human world.

73
00:06:28,954 --> 00:06:30,995
Here. You need to eat more.

74
00:06:31,713 --> 00:06:33,865
Mother, I'm full.

75
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:37,138
Are you gonna come back?

76
00:06:38,116 --> 00:06:39,959
I'll be back. Don't you worry, OK?

77
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:43,940
The sun above shines on the earth below,

78
00:06:44,074 --> 00:06:47,569
and the friendly gods, their blessings bestow.

79
00:06:47,937 --> 00:06:51,398
For seven days you will roam the human world

80
00:06:51,575 --> 00:06:54,609
and observe the natural laws that we govern.

81
00:06:54,863 --> 00:06:56,910
But remember this,

82
00:06:56,993 --> 00:07:00,075
you must not have any contact with humankind.

83
00:07:00,265 --> 00:07:03,198
Dragon of the sea and sky,

84
00:07:03,636 --> 00:07:05,978
awake!

85
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:24,306
Let the gateway be opened!

86
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:44,320
You heard him. Keep away from the humans.

87
00:07:44,462 --> 00:07:46,114
The farther away the better.

88
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:46,766
I know.

89
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:47,815
You hear?

90
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:49,298
Chun won't get into trouble.

91
00:07:49,485 --> 00:07:50,288
She's a clever girl.

92
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,468
Tell that to Ah King.

93
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:53,210
Her girl never came back!

94
00:07:54,315 --> 00:07:56,652
What are you waiting for?

95
00:07:56,715 --> 00:07:59,432
I can't hold this up forever!

96
00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:08,218
Remember, you must get back to the gateway in seven days.

97
00:08:08,306 --> 00:08:09,317
You can't be late...

98
00:08:09,395 --> 00:08:09,863
Mother...

99
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:11,437
Or you'll be left behind.

100
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,937
The soup. Out of the way.

101
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,783
My little girl has grown up.

102
00:08:42,776 --> 00:08:43,628
I should go.

103
00:08:44,866 --> 00:08:45,812
Chun...

104
00:08:46,707 --> 00:08:47,695
Be careful.

105
00:08:48,538 --> 00:08:49,173
I will.

106
00:08:49,268 --> 00:08:50,858
Keep track of the time.

107
00:08:51,359 --> 00:08:53,758
You run along now, Chun. Go on.

108
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:55,537
Don't worry. Goodbye.

109
00:09:12,674 --> 00:09:14,563
Chun! Wait!

110
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:20,352
The human world is beautiful, but dangerous.

111
00:09:20,553 --> 00:09:23,252
Remember, your world is here.

112
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,606
So long, Chun!

113
00:09:37,091 --> 00:09:39,330
Try not to miss me too much!

114
00:09:40,489 --> 00:09:42,548
Behave yourself up there!

115
00:09:52,305 --> 00:10:00,042
Every child who has turned 16 in the past year
is sent to the human world in a Rite of Passage...

116
00:10:00,227 --> 00:10:05,104
to see for ourselves how we control the rain, the wind,

117
00:10:05,143 --> 00:10:07,788
the sun, and the stars.

118
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:11,105
We have been taught how dangerous their world is

119
00:10:11,228 --> 00:10:16,108
but seeing it for ourselves,
it didn't seem dangerous at all.

120
00:10:16,377 --> 00:10:20,155
It was magical and so beautiful.

121
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:23,119
I had never been happier.

122
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,067
Look!

123
00:10:24,411 --> 00:10:26,500
The red dolphins came back again.

124
00:10:26,619 --> 00:10:27,477
I knew that they would,

125
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,717
just like last year at the same time!

126
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:31,306
Come on. Let's say hello.

127
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,546
Hey!

128
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:35,595
Up here!

129
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,300
Good to see you again!

130
00:10:51,873 --> 00:10:56,738
For six days, I explored the human world.

131
00:10:56,898 --> 00:11:00,233
I saw great wooden sailing ships,

132
00:11:00,447 --> 00:11:05,467
and lights that flickered and danced across the heavens.

133
00:11:06,731 --> 00:11:09,864
I saw the candles that the humans lit

134
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:16,574
to accompany the souls of the departed on
their journey down the rivers to the sea.

135
00:11:17,953 --> 00:11:19,624
I followed them,

136
00:11:20,005 --> 00:11:22,588
and on the seventh and final day,

137
00:11:22,842 --> 00:11:25,472
I too, returned to the ocean.

138
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,165
It was time to go home.

139
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:47,315
Watch this!

140
00:11:54,552 --> 00:11:55,623
You like that?

141
00:11:56,707 --> 00:11:58,112
Well, just you wait.

142
00:12:04,008 --> 00:12:05,261
What are you doing?

143
00:12:08,897 --> 00:12:10,981
Dolphin bait. Get my back, will you?

144
00:12:11,358 --> 00:12:12,038
OK.

145
00:12:14,557 --> 00:12:15,709
Come here, you.

146
00:12:16,461 --> 00:12:17,837
Wait right there.

147
00:12:17,992 --> 00:12:19,075
I will.

148
00:12:57,072 --> 00:12:58,409
Look at all the fish!

149
00:13:44,316 --> 00:13:46,256
What were you doing down there so long?

150
00:13:46,756 --> 00:13:48,217
Chasing a red dolphin.

151
00:13:48,993 --> 00:13:50,092
Do you see it?

152
00:13:53,952 --> 00:13:55,710
There's something different about her.

153
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:57,319
I can feel it.

154
00:14:30,231 --> 00:14:32,455
I'd lost track of the time.

155
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:36,193
The seventh and last day was nearly over.

156
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,542
I had to get back.

157
00:15:11,236 --> 00:15:13,674
I was running out of time.

158
00:15:14,531 --> 00:15:17,933
The gateway wouldn't stay open much longer.

159
00:15:30,255 --> 00:15:30,872
Where?

160
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,815
Out there. By the whirlpool.

161
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,438
It's a dolphin.

162
00:15:33,462 --> 00:15:34,086
Yeah.

163
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:35,889
The red one from before.

164
00:15:36,093 --> 00:15:37,555
She's caught in the net.

165
00:15:37,838 --> 00:15:39,402
I'm gonna try and cut her free.

166
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,698
Go fetch my knife.

167
00:15:40,745 --> 00:15:42,115
What about the whirlpool?

168
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:43,977
I'll be fine. Don't worry.

169
00:15:45,715 --> 00:15:46,544
Go get it.

170
00:15:54,218 --> 00:15:55,075
Thanks.

171
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,753
Brother, be careful!

172
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:25,741
OK, all right.

173
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:32,172
Brother!

174
00:16:37,424 --> 00:16:39,108
I'm trying to save you.

175
00:17:02,003 --> 00:17:04,345
Come back! No!

176
00:18:19,207 --> 00:18:22,859
Where is he? Where's my brother? I want my brother back.

177
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:25,451
I want him back and everything to be all right.

178
00:18:25,546 --> 00:18:27,739
Please, Brother. Don't go away!

179
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,334
Come back!

180
00:18:47,316 --> 00:18:51,071
Chun! You're back! Thank heavens!

181
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,750
What's the matter? Chun, are you all right?

182
00:18:53,781 --> 00:18:54,408
I'm fine.

183
00:18:54,472 --> 00:18:56,142
Come on. Let's talk at home.

184
00:18:56,879 --> 00:19:00,215
Thank goodness you're safe.
I've made your favorite dinner.

185
00:19:14,562 --> 00:19:16,008
Good morning, Grandmother.

186
00:19:16,254 --> 00:19:17,528
Is Grandfather up?

187
00:19:32,623 --> 00:19:35,412
Grandfather, where do humans go when they die?

188
00:19:36,143 --> 00:19:39,989
Their body is turned back into
the dust from which they were made.

189
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,386
And their souls?

190
00:19:41,537 --> 00:19:46,468
They go to Ascendance Palace where
they are transformed into tiny fishes.

191
00:19:46,595 --> 00:19:49,942
And watched over by Ling Po, the Lady of Souls.

192
00:19:50,132 --> 00:19:51,848
Will we die too, Grandfather?

193
00:19:51,885 --> 00:19:53,707
Of course we will.

194
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,488
Death is part of the natural order of things.

195
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:02,043
In fact, your grandfather's time is almost over.

196
00:20:02,186 --> 00:20:04,811
No! I don't want you to die.

197
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:06,824
Now, now, sweet child.

198
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:11,162
Death is not an end just as birth is not a beginning.

199
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,642
They're just stops on the path to eternity.

200
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:19,640
I knew grandfather was right, of course.

201
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:23,643
Because I knew I was destined to inherit his powers,

202
00:20:23,882 --> 00:20:26,957
and how could I do that if he did not die?

203
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:32,627
But knowing of things true is
not the same as wanting it so.

204
00:20:49,116 --> 00:20:51,920
What's that you're playing, child?

205
00:20:54,278 --> 00:20:55,194
Who's there?

206
00:20:55,384 --> 00:20:58,841
Your flute sounds like something from another world.

207
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:00,076
It's not mine.

208
00:21:00,454 --> 00:21:03,099
The sound is very pleasing.

209
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,014
Where did it come from?

210
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,278
The human world, a boy...

211
00:21:07,702 --> 00:21:09,081
He's dead now...

212
00:21:09,438 --> 00:21:10,741
because of me.

213
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:16,496
So that's why you're here. A human boy.

214
00:21:17,202 --> 00:21:20,968
Perhaps the Lady of Souls can help you.

215
00:21:23,671 --> 00:21:26,720
Come back here at midnight tonight

216
00:21:26,824 --> 00:21:29,159
and bring that bell with you.

217
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,837
Ring it and someone will come for you.

218
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:36,301
I will be here waiting.

219
00:24:13,404 --> 00:24:15,444
Did I do that? Sorry.

220
00:24:17,336 --> 00:24:19,949
Where you going? Kinda late, isn't it?

221
00:25:20,507 --> 00:25:21,983
The bell.

222
00:25:28,802 --> 00:25:29,801
That's it.

223
00:25:29,999 --> 00:25:31,959
Now get ready.

224
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:40,229
I had made my choice. There was no turning back.

225
00:26:40,718 --> 00:26:43,380
The moment I stepped aboard that boat,

226
00:26:43,554 --> 00:26:47,901
I knew my destiny had changed forever.

227
00:28:07,974 --> 00:28:09,460
You came alone?

228
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:13,378
Follow me.

229
00:28:29,266 --> 00:28:30,054
Sit.

230
00:28:30,578 --> 00:28:32,693
Thanks. I'd rather stand.

231
00:28:33,183 --> 00:28:36,585
What brings you to the Island of Souls?

232
00:28:37,822 --> 00:28:39,866
There's a soul I'm looking for.

233
00:28:44,357 --> 00:28:47,088
The soul of a human boy.

234
00:28:47,832 --> 00:28:49,993
What time was it he died?

235
00:28:51,446 --> 00:28:55,052
It was two days before the Wheat Harvest.

236
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,984
You need to be sure of the date,

237
00:28:58,396 --> 00:29:02,973
otherwise you're searching for a needle
in a haystack, so many die every day.

238
00:29:02,998 --> 00:29:03,742
I'm sure.

239
00:29:04,062 --> 00:29:05,600
It was my birthday.

240
00:29:05,931 --> 00:29:10,153
I know what you're trying to do, girl,
and it goes against the laws of nature.

241
00:29:10,178 --> 00:29:11,098
I don't care.

242
00:29:11,225 --> 00:29:12,645
I've got to save him.

243
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:16,023
The punishment is harsh for those
who defy nature no matter who you are

244
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:17,573
so you should care!

245
00:29:17,618 --> 00:29:20,592
But I owe him... for saving my life.

246
00:29:20,646 --> 00:29:22,394
How very touching.

247
00:29:22,705 --> 00:29:24,875
I've been stuck here for 800 years,

248
00:29:24,946 --> 00:29:27,585
and I'm still not done paying penance for my sins.

249
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:28,114
But you didn't...

250
00:29:28,138 --> 00:29:29,065
Don't interrupt!

251
00:29:29,446 --> 00:29:31,773
Let me tell you what real tragedy is.

252
00:29:31,878 --> 00:29:36,096
Meeting someone you care about so much
you forget yourself and make a mistake.

253
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,614
So then you go back and you try to
fix it and make things right again.

254
00:29:39,773 --> 00:29:42,378
And then you learn that fixing it is impossible.

255
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:47,957
We could never undo the wrongs we've done, this I know.

256
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:49,167
You're saying you won't help me?

257
00:29:49,192 --> 00:29:51,001
I'm saying I pity you.

258
00:29:51,136 --> 00:29:54,544
Besides, resurrecting someone
from the dead doesn't come cheap.

259
00:29:55,749 --> 00:29:56,889
What would it cost?

260
00:29:56,944 --> 00:30:00,335
No less than a lovely girl's loveliest features.

261
00:30:01,654 --> 00:30:02,885
Your eyes.

262
00:30:07,129 --> 00:30:08,988
Now she's scared.

263
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:12,832
Don't want to give up your pretty eyes?

264
00:30:14,493 --> 00:30:17,298
All right. I'll take half of your life instead.

265
00:30:17,453 --> 00:30:18,814
If that'll save him,

266
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:21,182
take it.

267
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:34,376
No, no, no! How many times do I
have to tell you? Not on the carpet!

268
00:30:35,121 --> 00:30:37,131
Why do you have so many cats?

269
00:30:37,352 --> 00:30:42,030
Who else would spend half of
eternity with an old bore like me?

270
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:50,666
Humankind came from the ocean.

271
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:55,646
That's why people's tears and
blood are salty like the sea.

272
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,533
From the moment they are born,

273
00:31:00,676 --> 00:31:03,253
their lives are journey homeward

274
00:31:03,345 --> 00:31:05,516
though they are unaware of this.

275
00:31:05,901 --> 00:31:09,719
They think they follow a path of their own choosing.

276
00:31:11,554 --> 00:31:14,105
They meet, they part.

277
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:18,092
Some grow old, some do not.

278
00:31:18,989 --> 00:31:20,626
But when they die,

279
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,322
the voice of the sea speaks to the soul

280
00:31:25,663 --> 00:31:28,547
calling all of them back

281
00:31:28,817 --> 00:31:33,226
and each swims off to their own separate destiny.

282
00:31:36,468 --> 00:31:39,010
This is the Hall of Souls,

283
00:31:39,756 --> 00:31:42,832
where all human souls are kept after death.

284
00:31:43,332 --> 00:31:45,540
So many souls.

285
00:31:46,693 --> 00:31:48,607
Will you be able to find him?

286
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,951
He won't look the same as he was.

287
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:53,103
I'll know him when I see him.

288
00:31:57,587 --> 00:32:00,063
I didn't even know his name,

289
00:32:00,244 --> 00:32:03,273
but I remembered everything about him...

290
00:32:03,607 --> 00:32:06,165
the scar on his forehead,

291
00:32:06,448 --> 00:32:08,643
the way he looked at me.

292
00:32:09,202 --> 00:32:13,072
I searched in there for hours and hours,

293
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,422
all night long.

294
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,295
And then...

295
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:39,955
Well, you see?

296
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:43,791
It requires a piece of your soul to wake him.

297
00:32:44,237 --> 00:32:46,779
Now your lives are bound together.

298
00:32:46,922 --> 00:32:52,236
It's up to you to protect him and guide
him through all the difficulties ahead...

299
00:32:52,793 --> 00:32:57,365
until he's grown enough to return to his world

300
00:32:57,992 --> 00:33:00,454
and be restored to life.

301
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,497
Now there's no turning back. Do not fail him...

302
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:09,560
or his soul will vanish into the void...

303
00:33:09,784 --> 00:33:11,330
Forever.

304
00:33:17,591 --> 00:33:19,197
Lazy rascal.

305
00:33:19,381 --> 00:33:20,945
Where were you all night?

306
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,297
And where did you get that?

307
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:26,799
No.

308
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,013
I'm Chun. Remember me?

309
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,165
I'm the red dolphin you saw.

310
00:33:37,969 --> 00:33:40,144
I suppose you don't remember your name.

311
00:33:41,008 --> 00:33:42,671
I'll just give you a new one.

312
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:45,038
My name means begonia.

313
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:48,534
One day I'll look after all the begonia trees like Mom.

314
00:33:50,643 --> 00:33:52,761
Don't worry. You won't always be small.

315
00:33:53,482 --> 00:33:54,723
You'll get bigger,

316
00:33:55,028 --> 00:33:56,701
bigger than this fish bowl,

317
00:33:57,048 --> 00:34:00,022
and the mirror, and the table.

318
00:34:01,074 --> 00:34:02,567
And the bed even!

319
00:34:04,103 --> 00:34:05,965
Bigger than this whole room!

320
00:34:06,023 --> 00:34:07,481
And this building!

321
00:34:08,151 --> 00:34:10,359
What's with all the racket? Keep it down!

322
00:34:11,806 --> 00:34:14,865
Anyway, I'll give you a good name.

323
00:34:21,867 --> 00:34:23,676
You cannot keep a fish here.

324
00:34:23,904 --> 00:34:26,019
Who asked you? Go away.

325
00:34:27,593 --> 00:34:29,545
Wait! I can keep a secret.

326
00:34:30,617 --> 00:34:31,973
You can trust me.

327
00:34:35,762 --> 00:34:38,238
Hey! I know a good name for him.

328
00:34:38,675 --> 00:34:39,666
What?

329
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:41,113
Open the window.

330
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,945
There's a fish in the Northern Ocean.

331
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,559
His name's Kun and he's enormous.

332
00:34:49,023 --> 00:34:51,616
I mean so big that he can't even be measured.

333
00:34:51,744 --> 00:34:53,491
That's what the ancient books say.

334
00:34:54,517 --> 00:34:56,837
So anyway, this Kun is gigantic,

335
00:34:56,967 --> 00:34:59,189
and get this. He can fly. Yeah!

336
00:34:59,228 --> 00:35:01,825
He's got wings that are the size of clouds!

337
00:35:02,177 --> 00:35:03,613
Are you finished?

338
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,131
Goodbye.

339
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,502
From now on,

340
00:35:09,922 --> 00:35:10,930
Your name...

341
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,988
is Kun.

342
00:35:29,491 --> 00:35:30,444
Kun?

343
00:35:31,703 --> 00:35:32,802
Kun?

344
00:35:46,776 --> 00:35:49,695
Rain this time of year. That's unusual.

345
00:35:56,915 --> 00:35:58,118
It's salty.

346
00:36:05,686 --> 00:36:06,816
You're growing.

347
00:36:17,684 --> 00:36:19,622
You wanna play, don't you?

348
00:36:20,022 --> 00:36:23,539
Remember when a red dolphin played in the sea with you?

349
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:24,476
Remember that?

350
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:39,651
You do remember!

351
00:36:40,143 --> 00:36:42,376
Come here. I wanna try something.

352
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,027
You can fly!

353
00:36:57,155 --> 00:36:58,314
It's true.

354
00:36:59,274 --> 00:37:00,872
Just like your namesake.

355
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:02,469
Amazing!

356
00:37:36,479 --> 00:37:40,287
Your family's calling you. They want you to come home.

357
00:37:41,882 --> 00:37:44,156
Kun, you keep growing, OK?

358
00:37:44,581 --> 00:37:45,911
I'll get you home again.

359
00:37:46,379 --> 00:37:47,382
Promise.

360
00:38:12,527 --> 00:38:13,387
Kun?

361
00:38:15,442 --> 00:38:17,532
Mother, were you in my room?

362
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,338
Yes. What's wrong with that?

363
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:20,464
What did you do with him?

364
00:38:20,917 --> 00:38:22,030
I threw it out.

365
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,191
Time you stopped playing with that thing.

366
00:38:25,528 --> 00:38:27,615
Mother, that thing is a human life!

367
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,396
What? Come back here! What did you say?

368
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:30,956
Chun.

369
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,946
Stop following me.

370
00:38:31,974 --> 00:38:33,240
Where you going?

371
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,091
You all right?

372
00:38:36,194 --> 00:38:37,871
My mother threw Kun away.

373
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:41,463
Don't worry. I know where to find him.

374
00:38:49,007 --> 00:38:50,806
Here! Over here.

375
00:38:59,864 --> 00:39:02,042
Nasty. But I bet he's there.

376
00:39:04,314 --> 00:39:05,139
Kun?

377
00:39:05,826 --> 00:39:06,742
It's him.

378
00:39:07,571 --> 00:39:09,247
Grab my feet. I'm gonna look.

379
00:39:09,272 --> 00:39:10,818
What? You can't go in.

380
00:39:11,304 --> 00:39:13,553
You sit tight. I've got it covered.

381
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,891
Besides, your mother would have a fit if you got lost too.

382
00:39:17,637 --> 00:39:19,972
Qiu! Be careful!

383
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:23,191
I knew it'd be nasty but not this nasty.

384
00:39:23,656 --> 00:39:24,548
Qiu,

385
00:39:25,022 --> 00:39:26,692
thanks for doing this.

386
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:31,714
Kun? Kun?

387
00:39:32,224 --> 00:39:34,718
Rats! Lots of 'em!

388
00:39:37,348 --> 00:39:39,501
Won't these rats try and eat Kun?

389
00:39:39,645 --> 00:39:41,709
You can be sure of it.

390
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,443
They'll strip him to the bone, they will.

391
00:39:48,671 --> 00:39:50,689
What an enchanting scent.

392
00:39:50,714 --> 00:39:52,856
That provocative perfume.

393
00:39:55,664 --> 00:39:58,655
Smells like... love.

394
00:39:58,955 --> 00:40:01,005
How can I help you, handsome?

395
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,242
What brings you to my neck of the woods?

396
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,627
I'm looking for a fish.

397
00:40:04,651 --> 00:40:05,267
A fish?

398
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:08,803
Well, as it happens, I've seen a fish.

399
00:40:08,876 --> 00:40:11,360
Really? You know where Kun is then?

400
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:14,689
That's no ordinary fish, is it?

401
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:17,971
You got it from the Lady of Souls, didn't you?

402
00:40:18,056 --> 00:40:21,403
Ling Po gets all the good people
who turn into fish when they die.

403
00:40:21,428 --> 00:40:24,238
I get all the bad ones who turn into rats.

404
00:40:24,731 --> 00:40:28,705
I think my rats are much cuter
than her slimy fish, don't you?

405
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,206
So you'll help me find him?

406
00:40:31,406 --> 00:40:33,559
No, sorry.

407
00:40:33,707 --> 00:40:35,178
Unless...

408
00:40:36,189 --> 00:40:39,025
You let me borrow your sweetheart for a dance!

409
00:40:41,067 --> 00:40:44,061
Relax. Go with it. Music!

410
00:40:44,419 --> 00:40:46,350
Ready, baby cakes?

411
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:48,526
Just follow my lead.

412
00:40:49,611 --> 00:40:51,012
Chun!

413
00:40:56,318 --> 00:40:59,040
There are two things that boys need to learn...

414
00:40:59,262 --> 00:41:00,597
how to dance,

415
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,092
and how to control their own little rats.

416
00:41:11,965 --> 00:41:15,032
It's a wonderful place, isn't it, the human world?

417
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:16,668
You've been to the human world?

418
00:41:17,209 --> 00:41:18,980
Look. They caught one.

419
00:41:25,617 --> 00:41:26,402
Kun!

420
00:41:30,136 --> 00:41:31,501
In you go.

421
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,289
That's it.

422
00:41:35,711 --> 00:41:36,775
Is he all right?

423
00:41:37,897 --> 00:41:39,279
He's not waking up.

424
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:44,765
He's alive!

425
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,357
Such a pure soul.

426
00:41:48,366 --> 00:41:52,649
Yes, he's sure to grow into a big fish indeed.

427
00:41:59,437 --> 00:42:00,647
I found ya!

428
00:42:05,172 --> 00:42:06,633
There you are.

429
00:42:11,473 --> 00:42:13,183
Now where'd they go?

430
00:42:15,057 --> 00:42:16,113
There you...

431
00:42:30,939 --> 00:42:33,551
Grandpa Houtu! Grandpa Houtu!

432
00:42:33,668 --> 00:42:36,789
There's a fish. I saw a fish. A big fish.

433
00:42:37,531 --> 00:42:39,661
Here. Down in this well.

434
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:46,025
But it was there before.

435
00:42:46,112 --> 00:42:47,930
I saw a fish. I swear!

436
00:42:47,955 --> 00:42:51,568
The unseasonal weather, the salty rain,

437
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,644
these are bad omens.

438
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:56,440
We must stay vigilant, every one of us.

439
00:43:00,094 --> 00:43:01,979
Good thing I saw them coming.

440
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:04,131
If they'd found him...

441
00:43:15,474 --> 00:43:17,763
This is your new home, Kun.

442
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,177
OK?

443
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:24,723
Hey, I think there's something hiding in there.

444
00:43:26,868 --> 00:43:28,405
Come on out!

445
00:43:37,966 --> 00:43:39,357
Chun! Watch out!

446
00:43:57,808 --> 00:43:58,777
Qiu!

447
00:43:58,959 --> 00:44:00,096
Stay back!

448
00:44:00,334 --> 00:44:02,542
Watch out! It has two heads!

449
00:44:04,054 --> 00:44:05,610
Now you tell me?

450
00:44:06,317 --> 00:44:07,626
Get off of me!

451
00:44:10,803 --> 00:44:14,966
Take this, snake! And that! And that!

452
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,263
And that!

453
00:44:18,334 --> 00:44:19,375
Qui! That's enough!

454
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:23,951
You OK?

455
00:44:26,653 --> 00:44:27,701
Qiu!

456
00:44:32,763 --> 00:44:33,915
Chun...

457
00:44:37,223 --> 00:44:38,865
I feel so tired.

458
00:44:40,194 --> 00:44:41,484
I just wanna go to sleep.

459
00:44:41,509 --> 00:44:44,246
No, don't fall asleep. You've got to stay awake.

460
00:44:44,403 --> 00:44:47,437
How about a song? I'll sing you a song.

461
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:53,697
The moon and stars hanging above the sea

462
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,016
The moon shines...

463
00:44:56,343 --> 00:44:57,763
You're not very good, are you?

464
00:44:57,788 --> 00:45:00,268
If it was pretty, it would put you to sleep.

465
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:06,165
Where are we?

466
00:45:06,484 --> 00:45:08,126
We're almost there.

467
00:45:08,525 --> 00:45:10,620
Don't you dare go to sleep.

468
00:45:16,825 --> 00:45:17,891
Grandfather!

469
00:45:18,389 --> 00:45:19,597
Help!

470
00:45:20,401 --> 00:45:23,261
He has been bitten by a two‐headed serpent.

471
00:45:23,644 --> 00:45:26,693
There is no known antidote to its venom.

472
00:45:27,477 --> 00:45:29,998
Grandfather, save him! Please!

473
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:32,207
Chun...

474
00:45:32,946 --> 00:45:34,344
This is for you.

475
00:45:34,863 --> 00:45:37,904
There is perhaps one way.

476
00:45:38,499 --> 00:45:42,175
Chun, wait outside. I will do what I can.

477
00:45:42,246 --> 00:45:43,074
Thank you.

478
00:46:32,552 --> 00:46:35,695
Hey! You're getting me all wet. You've got fish breath.

479
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,928
Qiu! Thank goodness you're OK!

480
00:46:38,453 --> 00:46:40,201
Alive and kicking thanks to your grandpa.

481
00:46:40,226 --> 00:46:41,407
He's pretty good.

482
00:46:42,153 --> 00:46:45,681
Pretty good? He's the master of all herbs and plants.

483
00:46:45,737 --> 00:46:47,420
He's awesome!

484
00:46:53,801 --> 00:46:55,676
Dearest old friend,

485
00:46:55,929 --> 00:46:59,704
can you still remember the day when we first met?

486
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:09,189
Soon I was to find out what it
had cost my grandfather to save Qiu.

487
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:11,354
Grandfather.

488
00:47:11,378 --> 00:47:12,207
Chun...

489
00:47:12,586 --> 00:47:13,574
come here.

490
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:17,079
It's time for me to go.

491
00:47:20,186 --> 00:47:22,418
It's 'cause of what I've done, isn't it?

492
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:26,629
No. No, child. Don't blame yourself.

493
00:47:27,074 --> 00:47:30,427
It is the natural order of things.

494
00:47:30,784 --> 00:47:33,303
Life and death are one thread.

495
00:47:33,869 --> 00:47:36,409
I must tell you something, Chun.

496
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,761
The course you have chosen is not an easy one.

497
00:47:40,334 --> 00:47:42,629
Everyone will be against you.

498
00:47:42,978 --> 00:47:45,243
But if your conscience is clear,

499
00:47:45,609 --> 00:47:48,540
then it doesn't matter what others think.

500
00:47:48,707 --> 00:47:51,368
Simply follow your heart.

501
00:47:52,434 --> 00:47:54,633
I will become a begonia tree

502
00:47:55,049 --> 00:47:57,272
and reunite with your grandmother,

503
00:47:57,887 --> 00:48:00,968
but I will always be here to support you.

504
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:04,082
Grandmother had been the master of birds.

505
00:48:04,288 --> 00:48:09,341
When she died, she turned into a
phoenix and kept Grandfather company.

506
00:48:09,936 --> 00:48:14,315
Two days after we talked, Grandfather was gone.

507
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:17,541
All the birds came to visit that day.

508
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:21,950
It felt like Grandmother had come back as well.

509
00:48:25,276 --> 00:48:27,136
Snow in midsummer.

510
00:48:28,234 --> 00:48:30,854
The seasons have fallen into chaos.

511
00:48:31,303 --> 00:48:32,871
Something is coming.

512
00:48:37,747 --> 00:48:40,707
Isn't this crazy weather? It's great!

513
00:48:40,774 --> 00:48:43,248
I love the snow!

514
00:48:48,265 --> 00:48:50,352
Do you believe God exists?

515
00:48:50,865 --> 00:48:51,655
No.

516
00:48:51,894 --> 00:48:52,902
I do.

517
00:48:53,675 --> 00:48:55,005
No one's ever seen him.

518
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:58,328
Humans have never seen us, but we exist.

519
00:48:59,004 --> 00:49:02,461
I won't be here when my parents get as old as Grandfather.

520
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,693
Just when they need me to look after them...

521
00:49:06,586 --> 00:49:07,791
I'll be gone.

522
00:49:08,547 --> 00:49:09,847
What are you talking about?

523
00:49:09,891 --> 00:49:11,897
I traded half my life away.

524
00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:13,867
You did what?

525
00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:16,364
I traded it for Kun.

526
00:49:16,669 --> 00:49:17,554
Chun!

527
00:49:17,969 --> 00:49:20,599
There you are! Get down here at once!

528
00:49:20,726 --> 00:49:21,671
I gotta go.

529
00:49:21,696 --> 00:49:22,212
Chun!

530
00:49:22,237 --> 00:49:22,626
Coming!

531
00:49:22,651 --> 00:49:24,821
You can't really believe my daughter is responsible!

532
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:26,068
She's connected to it somehow.

533
00:49:26,093 --> 00:49:28,428
The Elders are beginning to suspect Chun.

534
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:30,617
She and Kun are both in danger.

535
00:49:30,642 --> 00:49:31,523
Who are you?

536
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,708
Don't you recognize me, handsome?

537
00:49:34,209 --> 00:49:36,903
If they find Kun, your sweetie will be punished.

538
00:49:37,124 --> 00:49:40,232
You must hide him in the river inside the mountain cave.

539
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:42,115
Go on. Go on, hurry!

540
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:00,332
Chun's in big trouble...

541
00:50:00,825 --> 00:50:02,276
and it's all 'cause of you.

542
00:50:02,817 --> 00:50:03,635
Come on.

543
00:50:11,344 --> 00:50:13,592
As long as you're here she's in danger.

544
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:17,596
If you care about her you'll leave.

545
00:50:17,929 --> 00:50:18,675
Now.

546
00:50:29,752 --> 00:50:30,736
Where's Kun?

547
00:50:30,875 --> 00:50:31,768
He's gone.

548
00:50:32,168 --> 00:50:33,753
Gone? Gone where?

549
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:35,129
I set him free.

550
00:50:35,542 --> 00:50:37,067
He's in the river.

551
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:39,888
Chun, wait!

552
00:50:40,531 --> 00:50:42,151
I was trying to help you!

553
00:51:42,947 --> 00:51:45,626
A token. Just what I needed.

554
00:51:45,745 --> 00:51:49,234
You're my ticket to the human world.

555
00:52:04,956 --> 00:52:06,386
Kun...

556
00:52:06,528 --> 00:52:08,568
I thought I'd never see you again.

557
00:52:15,785 --> 00:52:18,858
Let's follow them. They'll know the way out of here.

558
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:18,761
Chun...

559
00:55:13,646 --> 00:55:16,387
I didn't have parents growing up like you did.

560
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:19,009
Just my grandmother.

561
00:55:19,328 --> 00:55:21,703
She does her best and I love her,

562
00:55:22,298 --> 00:55:25,659
but the only thing I've ever really cared about

563
00:55:26,098 --> 00:55:27,088
is you.

564
00:55:34,724 --> 00:55:36,083
Now I realize

565
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:38,485
how much you care about him.

566
00:55:40,395 --> 00:55:41,399
I was scared.

567
00:55:42,356 --> 00:55:43,742
I don't wanna see you hurt.

568
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:48,065
Please let her wake up.

569
00:57:16,405 --> 00:57:17,604
Kun!

570
00:58:06,504 --> 00:58:10,309
Kun, it was you who woke me, wasn't it?

571
00:58:11,097 --> 00:58:13,586
I don't ever wanna lose you again.

572
00:58:16,424 --> 00:58:18,643
She's OK! Yeah!

573
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:20,709
Isn't that great?

574
00:58:21,101 --> 00:58:22,719
Chun's OK!

575
00:58:54,491 --> 00:58:55,622
Your turn.

576
00:58:55,895 --> 00:58:57,815
What a terrible hand!

577
00:58:58,654 --> 00:59:01,966
Well, since you're here, you might as well come in.

578
00:59:07,688 --> 00:59:09,622
I'm sorry to bother you...

579
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:10,725
Triple.

580
00:59:12,932 --> 00:59:14,156
I have a question.

581
00:59:14,745 --> 00:59:15,776
What?

582
00:59:15,911 --> 00:59:18,596
Why did you give that human soul to Chun?

583
00:59:19,637 --> 00:59:21,618
It was a trade, not a gift!

584
00:59:21,742 --> 00:59:23,753
If you're willing to pay the price...

585
00:59:23,975 --> 00:59:26,822
There's not a thing in this world that can't be traded.

586
00:59:27,882 --> 00:59:29,252
Even half a lifetime?

587
00:59:30,173 --> 00:59:32,624
Well, aren't you the clever fellow?

588
00:59:33,959 --> 00:59:38,061
So, I can give half my lifetime and trade for hers.

589
00:59:38,212 --> 00:59:42,388
Of course. However, the price just went up.

590
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:45,020
You'd have to trade your whole life.

591
00:59:45,095 --> 00:59:45,656
Fine.

592
00:59:47,713 --> 00:59:49,263
I should warn you, however...

593
00:59:49,368 --> 00:59:51,402
Even that's not gonna save her!

594
00:59:51,552 --> 00:59:55,350
That little girl's life is tied
to that great big fish of hers.

595
00:59:55,488 --> 00:59:57,448
When it dies, she dies.

596
00:59:57,525 --> 00:59:59,654
What if the fish returned home?

597
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:01,792
If the fish goes back...

598
01:00:01,903 --> 01:00:03,207
On the very day it leaves...

599
01:00:03,443 --> 01:00:05,128
She'll die too.

600
01:00:06,274 --> 01:00:07,996
There must be a way to save her.

601
01:00:09,623 --> 01:00:12,104
Mahjong! I win!

602
01:00:14,741 --> 01:00:17,798
Come play a round. You might even win.

603
01:00:18,504 --> 01:00:19,684
The table's full.

604
01:00:20,089 --> 01:00:20,948
There.

605
01:00:21,131 --> 01:00:22,314
Now it isn't.

606
01:00:38,566 --> 01:00:41,121
Wow. That's lucky. I win.

607
01:00:41,959 --> 01:00:43,558
I don't believe...

608
01:00:46,737 --> 01:00:48,138
What's luck anyway?

609
01:00:48,325 --> 01:00:51,442
Good luck, bad luck. It's just fate, really.

610
01:00:57,082 --> 01:00:59,375
It's all up to you now.

611
01:00:59,746 --> 01:01:00,401
What?

612
01:01:01,808 --> 01:01:04,254
I said it's all up to you now.

613
01:01:04,301 --> 01:01:06,294
All in your hands.

614
01:01:19,851 --> 01:01:22,668
Goodbye. Thank you.

615
01:01:22,758 --> 01:01:27,970
You young kids live life like a worthless
rock you found by the side of the road,

616
01:01:27,995 --> 01:01:33,229
while old hags like me have to rack our
brains figuring out how to live another day.

617
01:01:33,645 --> 01:01:36,454
Without joy, what's the point of a long life?

618
01:01:57,019 --> 01:01:59,329
What would we give up?

619
01:01:59,813 --> 01:02:04,121
What sacrifices would we make for those we love?

620
01:02:05,002 --> 01:02:07,750
What are we willing to risk losing?

621
01:02:08,633 --> 01:02:13,455
Half our lives, our family and friends,

622
01:02:13,765 --> 01:02:15,988
and the world we know?

623
01:02:17,014 --> 01:02:20,294
By the time we ask ourselves these things,

624
01:02:20,376 --> 01:02:22,006
if we ask them,

625
01:02:22,257 --> 01:02:25,206
it's usually too late to matter.

626
01:02:25,706 --> 01:02:28,591
We already know the answer.

627
01:03:01,253 --> 01:03:03,619
What have you got to help me forget something?

628
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:05,250
You sure you want to?

629
01:03:05,493 --> 01:03:07,781
Real forgetting is not that difficult.

630
01:03:09,508 --> 01:03:10,826
But it hurts.

631
01:03:11,337 --> 01:03:14,028
Feeling pain can be a good thing.

632
01:03:15,181 --> 01:03:17,681
Do you have anything that'll make it go away?

633
01:03:17,895 --> 01:03:19,166
There is something.

634
01:03:19,319 --> 01:03:21,728
It will make you forget all your sorrows,

635
01:03:21,753 --> 01:03:23,408
but all your pleasures as well.

636
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,211
Mengpo potion.

637
01:03:27,723 --> 01:03:29,424
Well, maybe just some wine.

638
01:03:35,629 --> 01:03:38,623
Got something for a hangover? It's my first drink.

639
01:03:52,092 --> 01:03:54,149
Do you even know who's in love with you?

640
01:03:54,291 --> 01:03:56,278
And the things he's done for you?

641
01:03:56,405 --> 01:03:58,033
He's forsaking everything,

642
01:03:58,195 --> 01:03:59,825
betraying everyone...

643
01:03:59,924 --> 01:04:01,958
for your happiness!

644
01:04:08,006 --> 01:04:10,587
The sea is flowing backwards.

645
01:04:10,778 --> 01:04:13,288
The heavens are angry with us.

646
01:04:14,989 --> 01:04:18,221
Only by destroying that creature will we set things right.

647
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:24,602
I can tell you where the big fish is,

648
01:04:24,937 --> 01:04:29,748
but first, you will have to break the
seal and allow me to see the sunlight.

649
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:37,656
Things are getting awfully messy.

650
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:40,666
I think it's time to clean it up.

651
01:04:41,843 --> 01:04:45,458
Well, baby? Are you ready?

652
01:04:47,388 --> 01:04:50,718
The great fish comes and we must go

653
01:04:50,743 --> 01:04:53,457
To get to higher ground

654
01:04:53,878 --> 01:04:57,286
We shall all go up to the mountain top

655
01:04:57,449 --> 01:05:00,948
While the waters gather round

656
01:05:01,286 --> 01:05:04,811
The rains come down, the rains come down

657
01:05:04,836 --> 01:05:08,305
Till the land becomes the sea

658
01:05:08,418 --> 01:05:12,223
Old home gone, get your new home on

659
01:05:12,248 --> 01:05:15,655
Where will my new home be

660
01:05:15,758 --> 01:05:20,008
Where will my new home be

661
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,964
Pei, terrible news.

662
01:05:27,989 --> 01:05:30,450
Someone has taken the Dragon mask!

663
01:05:45,602 --> 01:05:47,657
Chun! Listen to me.

664
01:05:47,808 --> 01:05:49,962
Get away from it right now.

665
01:05:50,615 --> 01:05:53,323
Leave that monster to us.

666
01:05:53,523 --> 01:05:56,166
Don't hurt him. He's not a monster.

667
01:05:56,464 --> 01:05:58,001
Ungrateful child!

668
01:05:59,338 --> 01:06:01,800
Mother, forgive me.

669
01:06:12,081 --> 01:06:14,106
Feng, why do you stop?

670
01:06:14,632 --> 01:06:17,029
Go. Destroy it!

671
01:06:17,138 --> 01:06:18,402
No, I'll do it.

672
01:06:18,426 --> 01:06:19,993
You had your chance.

673
01:06:28,131 --> 01:06:30,194
Kun. Go. Fly!

674
01:06:32,056 --> 01:06:34,049
Don't let it get away!

675
01:06:34,978 --> 01:06:36,488
Fly, Kun. Fly!

676
01:06:42,455 --> 01:06:45,243
Go, Chun! Now's your chance!

677
01:06:45,457 --> 01:06:47,706
Get Kun back home! Go on!

678
01:06:47,857 --> 01:06:49,107
Heavens, no.

679
01:06:49,273 --> 01:06:50,483
Hurry, Chun!

680
01:06:50,685 --> 01:06:52,465
Get him out of here while you can!

681
01:06:52,584 --> 01:06:53,321
Qiu!

682
01:06:53,345 --> 01:06:54,617
Qiu, stop!

683
01:06:54,739 --> 01:06:57,121
You're not strong enough to control the gateway.

684
01:06:57,318 --> 01:06:58,814
Just watch!

685
01:07:09,602 --> 01:07:13,050
We need Pei. Go find his grandmother. Hurry!

686
01:07:13,296 --> 01:07:15,301
I can't hold on much longer!

687
01:07:15,347 --> 01:07:18,484
Chun! Get going!

688
01:07:18,572 --> 01:07:20,176
Go, Kun!

689
01:07:23,522 --> 01:07:26,637
I'm finally going back to the human world!

690
01:07:27,875 --> 01:07:30,330
Thanks for the help, handsome!

691
01:07:30,442 --> 01:07:32,959
I'll think of you from up there.

692
01:07:34,786 --> 01:07:36,152
What have we done?

693
01:07:36,949 --> 01:07:42,780
Sorry, sweetie, but without a token from the
human world, you can't pass through the gateway.

694
01:08:40,684 --> 01:08:42,614
Grandfather saved us.

695
01:09:02,323 --> 01:09:04,547
Kun, be strong.

696
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:10,225
Our fate's have been connected since the day we met...

697
01:09:10,407 --> 01:09:12,654
and I don't regret it.

698
01:09:23,157 --> 01:09:26,366
Brother Songzi, what will we do if we don't find everyone?

699
01:09:26,391 --> 01:09:27,198
We'll find them.

700
01:09:27,222 --> 01:09:27,860
OK.

701
01:09:32,769 --> 01:09:33,979
Grandma.

702
01:09:35,859 --> 01:09:38,482
Down there! There's people in the water!

703
01:09:38,611 --> 01:09:40,981
Help! Help!

704
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:42,613
Over here!

705
01:09:42,638 --> 01:09:44,545
It's Tingmu and his sister!

706
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:46,905
Take her first!

707
01:09:51,564 --> 01:09:52,783
Little sister!

708
01:09:54,502 --> 01:09:56,101
Has anyone seen Qiu?

709
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:57,208
No, not yet.

710
01:09:57,233 --> 01:09:59,409
Tingmu is still out there. We have to go back.

711
01:09:59,934 --> 01:10:01,245
I'll come with you.

712
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:02,957
Tingmu!

713
01:10:02,981 --> 01:10:04,032
Tingmu!

714
01:10:04,088 --> 01:10:05,138
Tingmu!

715
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,173
Tingmu!

716
01:10:08,006 --> 01:10:09,268
Tingmu!

717
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,577
Kun, don't give up now.

718
01:10:23,592 --> 01:10:26,604
You have to fly and get through the gateway.

719
01:10:31,674 --> 01:10:34,908
Go on. I'll be all right. Don't worry.

720
01:10:35,704 --> 01:10:37,624
Grandfather will protect me.

721
01:10:37,746 --> 01:10:39,553
Now go while you can!

722
01:10:40,246 --> 01:10:41,256
Go on!

723
01:10:47,255 --> 01:10:49,351
Down there. It's that creature.

724
01:10:50,099 --> 01:10:52,259
Quick. We mustn't let it get away.

725
01:10:52,399 --> 01:10:54,857
But first, let's find Tingmu.

726
01:10:55,188 --> 01:10:58,560
If that monster escapes, our
whole world will be destroyed.

727
01:10:58,691 --> 01:10:59,942
We can't wait.

728
01:11:10,977 --> 01:11:12,313
Go, Kun!

729
01:11:13,197 --> 01:11:14,367
Go!

730
01:11:25,946 --> 01:11:26,962
Kun!

731
01:11:27,517 --> 01:11:29,877
Fly! Fly, Kun!

732
01:11:35,362 --> 01:11:36,742
Grandfather.

733
01:11:38,438 --> 01:11:39,577
Please help.

734
01:11:39,931 --> 01:11:41,890
What should I do? Tell me.

735
01:11:43,267 --> 01:11:44,958
What can I do?

736
01:12:07,555 --> 01:12:08,769
Please save him.

737
01:12:09,865 --> 01:12:11,755
Please, Grandfather.

738
01:12:31,649 --> 01:12:33,873
Grandmother! Here!

739
01:12:50,642 --> 01:12:52,392
He's done nothing wrong.

740
01:12:52,622 --> 01:12:54,190
Why are you protecting him?

741
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:57,448
He died saving me, now I need to save him!

742
01:12:57,644 --> 01:12:59,498
His little sister is waiting.

743
01:12:59,617 --> 01:13:01,815
Tingmu has been swept away in the flood.

744
01:13:02,048 --> 01:13:03,524
What about his sister?

745
01:13:14,526 --> 01:13:16,816
Run. Everyone, run!

746
01:13:18,289 --> 01:13:21,527
Get to higher ground. Go. To the mountaintop. Hurry!

747
01:13:21,611 --> 01:13:23,886
Over here. Help me make a bridge.

748
01:13:35,262 --> 01:13:38,030
The others need us. We have to go help them.

749
01:13:46,025 --> 01:13:47,914
I've got to help my family.

750
01:13:48,226 --> 01:13:49,527
I can't go with you.

751
01:14:02,089 --> 01:14:02,689
My brother!

752
01:14:02,713 --> 01:14:03,168
Chi Songzi!

753
01:14:03,251 --> 01:14:04,318
Where's Tingmu?

754
01:14:04,342 --> 01:14:05,337
Did you find Tingmu?

755
01:14:05,362 --> 01:14:06,362
I'm afraid not.

756
01:14:06,656 --> 01:14:07,201
What?

757
01:14:07,225 --> 01:14:08,143
I'm sorry.

758
01:14:20,553 --> 01:14:21,577
Mother!

759
01:14:24,704 --> 01:14:27,186
Mother, I'm here to help!

760
01:14:29,650 --> 01:14:32,381
No! We don't need any help from you!

761
01:14:34,949 --> 01:14:37,330
Please, child. Go.

762
01:14:38,494 --> 01:14:40,739
Give me my Tingmu back.

763
01:15:10,834 --> 01:15:13,765
I want Tingmu to come back.

764
01:15:18,785 --> 01:15:21,209
Hurry, everyone. We must hurry.

765
01:15:21,604 --> 01:15:22,378
Stay calm.

766
01:15:34,518 --> 01:15:36,051
Hold the water back!

767
01:15:52,157 --> 01:15:53,012
Hey.

768
01:16:02,522 --> 01:16:03,301
Feng!

769
01:16:07,409 --> 01:16:09,131
It's all my fault.

770
01:16:09,419 --> 01:16:12,621
Everything bad that's happened
is because of what I've done.

771
01:16:13,422 --> 01:16:17,109
The one good will be if you make
it back and live your life again...

772
01:16:17,770 --> 01:16:19,835
as it was before we met.

773
01:16:20,552 --> 01:16:21,670
Fly, Kun.

774
01:16:22,326 --> 01:16:24,348
Go home and live your life...

775
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:26,867
a beautiful life.

776
01:16:34,677 --> 01:16:36,647
I'm coming, Grandfather.

777
01:18:14,269 --> 01:18:15,519
Ma!

778
01:18:15,847 --> 01:18:16,444
Tingmu?

779
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,436
It's me!

780
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:18,755
Up here!

781
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:19,843
Tingmu!

782
01:18:20,841 --> 01:18:22,160
Mama! It's me!

783
01:18:22,184 --> 01:18:22,761
Tingmu!

784
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:24,354
Look, it's me!

785
01:18:24,391 --> 01:18:25,418
Oh, Chun!

786
01:18:30,363 --> 01:18:31,901
Chun!

787
01:19:58,856 --> 01:20:02,236
Finally, the moment's here.

788
01:20:34,350 --> 01:20:36,115
Why haven't you left?

789
01:20:37,212 --> 01:20:40,874
Here. Sister Leizu wove this for you.

790
01:20:41,152 --> 01:20:43,271
Try it on. It should fit.

791
01:20:44,276 --> 01:20:45,099
Thank you.

792
01:20:48,197 --> 01:20:49,470
Why am I here?

793
01:20:49,907 --> 01:20:51,207
Am I dead?

794
01:20:51,283 --> 01:20:52,425
No, child.

795
01:20:52,801 --> 01:20:54,811
But you've lost all your powers.

796
01:20:55,204 --> 01:20:56,603
You can't stay here.

797
01:20:56,725 --> 01:20:57,938
What about the others?

798
01:20:57,977 --> 01:21:00,935
Don't worry. Your sacrifice saved them...

799
01:21:01,413 --> 01:21:04,319
and now the balance is restored.

800
01:21:05,058 --> 01:21:11,349
Go south till you come to the Southern Sky
Pools. You can accompany him on his journey home.

801
01:21:11,524 --> 01:21:14,837
But know that when he returns to the human world,

802
01:21:14,924 --> 01:21:17,706
he won't remember you or any of this.

803
01:21:17,731 --> 01:21:18,682
All right.

804
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:22,520
You'll tell my mother I'm still alive, won't you?

805
01:21:23,999 --> 01:21:25,101
Go now.

806
01:21:29,504 --> 01:21:30,552
Thank you.

807
01:21:31,396 --> 01:21:32,752
No need for that.

808
01:21:33,018 --> 01:21:34,793
A deal is a deal.

809
01:21:35,359 --> 01:21:39,243
You should thank the one who
traded away his life for yours.

810
01:21:52,186 --> 01:21:55,381
Chun! Chun! Hey!

811
01:21:55,462 --> 01:21:56,706
Over here!

812
01:21:57,773 --> 01:22:00,723
Wait up! I'm coming with you!

813
01:22:02,928 --> 01:22:04,531
I can't swim!

814
01:22:26,868 --> 01:22:27,780
What you thinking?

815
01:22:29,246 --> 01:22:30,416
There's so many...

816
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:32,840
So many stars.

817
01:22:33,496 --> 01:22:35,421
Whenever I look up at the sky,

818
01:22:36,211 --> 01:22:38,633
it's like I hear someone calling to me.

819
01:22:39,707 --> 01:22:40,872
What do you think?

820
01:22:41,239 --> 01:22:42,986
There's something I've been wondering.

821
01:22:44,155 --> 01:22:45,830
Does love last forever?

822
01:22:46,548 --> 01:22:47,578
Like the stars?

823
01:22:48,765 --> 01:22:49,428
Yeah.

824
01:22:51,310 --> 01:22:52,519
Once Kun is safe,

825
01:22:52,866 --> 01:22:54,139
we'll go home, right?

826
01:22:54,938 --> 01:22:56,349
My powers are gone.

827
01:22:56,443 --> 01:22:57,635
I can't go home.

828
01:22:58,817 --> 01:23:00,258
The human world is nice.

829
01:23:00,902 --> 01:23:02,442
Is that where you want to live?

830
01:23:02,798 --> 01:23:03,770
With Kun?

831
01:23:04,541 --> 01:23:07,822
Impossible. I don't belong to his world.

832
01:23:08,894 --> 01:23:12,039
I wasn't asking if it's possible.

833
01:23:12,873 --> 01:23:14,597
I asked if it's what you want.

834
01:23:16,894 --> 01:23:17,664
Here.

835
01:23:24,301 --> 01:23:26,230
You know, you look cute when you're eating.

836
01:23:26,964 --> 01:23:28,669
I know you pretty well by now.

837
01:23:33,031 --> 01:23:34,604
I've seen all of you.

838
01:23:35,398 --> 01:23:37,892
When you're tired, when you're angry,

839
01:23:38,426 --> 01:23:39,481
when you're sad,

840
01:23:39,844 --> 01:23:41,157
even embarrassed.

841
01:23:41,837 --> 01:23:43,097
It's all beautiful.

842
01:23:44,336 --> 01:23:45,830
You're like a brother to me.

843
01:23:47,812 --> 01:23:48,546
Right.

844
01:24:04,883 --> 01:24:05,864
You awake?

845
01:24:06,645 --> 01:24:07,494
Uh‐huh.

846
01:24:09,273 --> 01:24:10,245
You cold?

847
01:24:10,638 --> 01:24:11,189
No.

848
01:24:11,736 --> 01:24:12,787
You should sleep.

849
01:24:19,267 --> 01:24:20,025
Qiu?

850
01:24:21,777 --> 01:24:23,670
Thank you for always being there.

851
01:24:24,069 --> 01:24:27,007
You treat me better than anyone else ever did.

852
01:25:44,433 --> 01:25:46,425
Will we ever see each other again?

853
01:25:47,455 --> 01:25:49,086
Would you recognize me?

854
01:25:50,497 --> 01:25:52,087
We will meet again.

855
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:54,790
And despite what Ling Po said,

856
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:58,351
I know we will recognize each another,

857
01:25:58,789 --> 01:26:02,387
no matter how much we'd changed.

858
01:26:53,914 --> 01:26:55,245
Kun!

859
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:03,776
Leave now.

860
01:28:03,801 --> 01:28:05,381
It's time to go home.

861
01:30:19,541 --> 01:30:20,501
Qiu!

862
01:30:20,526 --> 01:30:22,876
Quick! Take hold of my hand!

863
01:30:24,197 --> 01:30:27,351
Come on, hurry! We don't have much time!

864
01:30:30,294 --> 01:30:31,601
What's happening to you?

865
01:30:31,870 --> 01:30:33,620
I fixed it so you can live...

866
01:30:33,753 --> 01:30:35,002
in Kun's world.

867
01:30:35,971 --> 01:30:37,757
But aren't we going home together?

868
01:30:38,008 --> 01:30:39,718
I got your life back for you

869
01:30:39,967 --> 01:30:41,833
so you can go with him if you want.

870
01:30:43,583 --> 01:30:44,024
No.

871
01:30:44,049 --> 01:30:44,719
Wait!

872
01:30:44,942 --> 01:30:45,597
No!

873
01:30:45,728 --> 01:30:47,063
Stop it!

874
01:30:47,239 --> 01:30:48,963
Chun, listen...

875
01:30:49,074 --> 01:30:50,242
Listen to me.

876
01:30:50,517 --> 01:30:51,386
Listen.

877
01:30:52,095 --> 01:30:53,142
It's OK.

878
01:30:53,356 --> 01:30:53,836
Qiu.

879
01:30:53,860 --> 01:30:55,517
You know this is right, Chun.

880
01:30:56,594 --> 01:30:57,892
You have to go.

881
01:30:58,377 --> 01:31:00,847
Trust me on this and I know we'll meet again.

882
01:31:04,191 --> 01:31:05,247
I wish I'd...

883
01:31:05,552 --> 01:31:07,887
I wish I'd held you closer when I could have.

884
01:31:08,645 --> 01:31:09,960
Just one time...

885
01:31:10,617 --> 01:31:11,618
Come on.

886
01:31:16,642 --> 01:31:18,874
When I count to three, we jump, OK?

887
01:31:19,991 --> 01:31:21,154
Trust me!

888
01:31:23,083 --> 01:31:24,244
One,

889
01:31:24,813 --> 01:31:25,905
two,

890
01:31:26,210 --> 01:31:27,294
three!

891
01:31:33,653 --> 01:31:36,781
When you see the wind and rain,
think of me and I'll be with you...

892
01:31:39,946 --> 01:31:40,599
Always.

893
01:31:40,623 --> 01:31:41,690
Qui...

894
01:31:42,945 --> 01:31:44,405
Goodbye, Chun.

895
01:31:44,655 --> 01:31:45,735
No!

896
01:33:08,301 --> 01:33:11,071
Do you believe in miracles?

897
01:33:11,424 --> 01:33:15,099
We each spend countless cycles waiting...

898
01:33:15,678 --> 01:33:20,685
waiting for the chance to
enjoy this adventure called life.

899
01:33:21,005 --> 01:33:26,572
It's so easy to forget how precious life is, how short.

900
01:33:27,042 --> 01:33:31,585
It's lost in a thousand little moments of not caring.

901
01:33:32,048 --> 01:33:34,770
It doesn't hurt to be braver,

902
01:33:35,336 --> 01:33:39,632
to be more grateful, more loving.

903
01:33:41,124 --> 01:33:44,432
There are many things I don't understand,

904
01:33:44,598 --> 01:33:48,324
and many questions I can never answer.

905
01:33:48,818 --> 01:33:51,630
But one thing I do believe,

906
01:33:52,086 --> 01:33:54,536
that the heavens gave us life

907
01:33:54,586 --> 01:33:59,590
so that each of us can create miracles.

908
01:38:14,084 --> 01:38:15,647
It's time, my friend.

909
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:33,300
From now on,

910
01:38:33,501 --> 01:38:36,001
you'll be taking over for me.
