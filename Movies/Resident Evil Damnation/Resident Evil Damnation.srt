1
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:24,057
For 74 years, the might of Soviet socialism was so great...

2
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,525
... it split the world...

3
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:27,527
... along Eastern and Western lines.

4
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,499
Then, in 1991, it collapsed completely.

5
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:34,534
One by one, the various countries

6
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:36,836
which had supported the Soviet Union...

7
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,271
... began splitting away...

8
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:41,141
... declaring their independence.

9
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:43,209
The parliament of the Eastern Slav Republic...

10
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:44,611
... followed suit, declaring

11
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,246
the country a sovereign state...

12
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,915
... independent from Soviet rule.

13
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,918
Capitalism advanced rapidly.

14
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,821
The conglomerates gained influence in political circles...

15
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:58,158
... and as a result, ithe oligarchs came into power.

16
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,060
In the Eastern Slav Republic...

17
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,829
... the divide between rich and poor ibecame so great...

18
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:06,366
... it ignited the fuse iof a new rebellion.

19
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:09,169
The push for independence...

20
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:10,804
... exploded into the streets.

21
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,639
Armed freedom fighters pitted

22
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:14,741
themselves against their government...

23
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:18,645
... now controlled by the oligarchs.

24
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,847
The military prospered iduring this time...

25
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,817
... becoming ever stronger and better equipped.

26
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,985
U nder the guidance of Ivan Judanovich...

27
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,521
... an Ataman ifrom the Council of Elders...

28
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:31,024
... the freedom fighters imoved their base...

29
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:32,592
... to a hidden location.

30
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:35,028
A more suitable place to launch...

31
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,897
... their guerrilla war iagainst the government.

32
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:42,135
After several years of brutal fighting...

33
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,237
... it was Svetlana Belikova...

34
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,706
... Eastern Slav's first female president...

35
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,976
who offered a ceasefire to the freedom fighters.

36
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,047
But the break from hostilities was short-lived.

37
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,050
In November of 2010, the government discovered...

38
00:01:57,183 --> 00:02:00,253
... that the rebels' land icontained valuable resources.

39
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,455
The military continued their attacks...

40
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,758
... claiming they were ifighting terrorism.

41
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,627
Losing one base after another

42
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,329
ito the military's onslaught...

43
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,931
the freedom fighters iescalated their efforts...

44
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,968
and became more and more iradical in their tactics.

45
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,036
It was then that strange rumors...

46
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,906
... began spreading like wildfire among the people...

47
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,675
... that monsters had joined the battle.

48
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,612
In February of 2011...

49
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:28,515
... the rumors made it to ithe old city of Holifgrad...

50
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,384
i... just a few kilometers ifrom the Presidential Palace...

51
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:34,854
i... an important strategic location ifor the government.

52
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:52,705
iListen to the words of the elders.

53
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:57,577
iWe have finally gained ithe power that we need.

54
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:02,582
Power that will lead us to victory.

55
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,585
iGather, people.

56
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,722
Gather and fight.

57
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:13,726
Fight for independence!

58
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,341
Retreat! We're getting slaughtered!

59
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,477
Another rebel!

60
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,980
- Do not resist arrest. - Retreat!

61
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,281
Drop your weapons.

62
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,616
- Surrender immediately. - Government pigs!

63
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:39,352
I repeat, do not resist arrest.

64
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,854
Surrender immediately.

65
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,310
Moving into position.

66
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,813
iCopy.

67
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:09,415
I've got a clear view of you from the sky.

68
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,454
Great.

69
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,423
Maybe you can help me find a clear route to the CIA drop-off.

70
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:29,135
Looks like they're doing some serious renovations down here.

71
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,903
Listen to me carefully, Leon.

72
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,939
Your mission has been aborted.

73
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:36,075
The U.S. Is going to pull outiof the country.

74
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,910
What? I just got here.

75
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,546
After taking me off furlough and sending me to this...

76
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,148
...godforsaken place?

77
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,583
What the hell?

78
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,485
Washington and the government there

79
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,553
have decided to go their separate ways.

80
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,889
Everyone has to leave, not just embassy staff.

81
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,858
All American citizens have been

82
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,893
ordered to evacuate the country.

83
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,928
I don't give a damn about the politics.

84
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:59,599
We've got confirmation that B.O.W.s are being used in this war.

85
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,100
If we don't stop them now...

86
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,603
...the same shit will happen everywhere.

87
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,571
Do you really wanna see that?

88
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,974
This is a war and things are different.

89
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:11,878
No one can do anything without backup from the American government.

90
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:12,979
Not even you.

91
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,815
Well, then I guess my only option is to...

92
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,384
...lose my American citizenship for a while.

93
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,886
iLeon!

94
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,989
She can tell them I got lost and missed my flight.

95
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,594
Better hurry up and get this done.

96
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,730
I need some breakfast.

97
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,354
Scarecrow.

98
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,222
I'm the Tin Man. Can you talk?

99
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,326
What's the connection between the

100
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,228
anti-government forces and the B.O.W.s?

101
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,200
I guess scarecrows aren't known...

102
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,068
...for rousing conversation.

103
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,237
Hang in there.

104
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,972
I'll get you out of here.

105
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,541
Bee...

106
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,211
What?

107
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:26,813
Say that again.

108
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:28,948
Bee...

109
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,684
...keeper. - Beekeeper?

110
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,955
The honeybee I saw outside.

111
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:51,270
Great. Now I got a cowardly lion to deal with.

112
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,080
It's the army.

113
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,948
Is anyone here?

114
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,755
Check the room down there.

115
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:31,931
Hey...

116
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,834
Don't say a word.

117
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,438
How about that one?

118
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,955
This one's clear.

119
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,256
Clear.

120
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,625
This one's clear. We're moving on.

121
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,227
Pull out.

122
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,864
They're gone.

123
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,903
We better stay here a while longer.

124
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,706
They may come back

125
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,447
Do you think our hostage...

126
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,782
...will be of any use?

127
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,288
Do you know who we are?

128
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,523
Are you Dorothy?

129
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:35,027
You people in the CIA call us terrorists.

130
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,730
But we prefer to call ourselves...

131
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:41,067
...pro-independence fighters.

132
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,136
What is the CIA doing here?

133
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,639
Did you put the government up to this?

134
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,007
Are there any more of you?

135
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,642
I'm not a CIA agent.

136
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,878
I'm just an American who was screwed out of his vacation...

137
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,347
...dumped on a plane and brought here.

138
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,782
Without breakfast.

139
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,351
They came for you while you were on vacation?

140
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,986
Hey, Buddy.

141
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,656
He's got to be high up in the CIA for them to do that.

142
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,391
You watch too many movies.

143
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:06,826
Then what are you?

144
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,961
Is it common for people in America...

145
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,764
...to be packing one of these while on vacation?

146
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:15,434
Sure. We've been doing it since the country was founded.

147
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,037
Wow, America's the bomb, yo.

148
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,440
Whatever.

149
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,309
But even if you're not CIA...

150
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:26,178
...there is no doubt you must be pretty special...

151
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,881
...for America to send you here.

152
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,550
You were able to take on that thing, after all.

153
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,253
If you don't stop messing around with that thing...

154
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,155
...you're gonna get us all killed.

155
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:40,092
There is no doubt about the fact that you are our enemy.

156
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:57,476
An anti-terrorist sweep is now in operation.

157
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,911
Civilians should avoid...

158
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,646
... going outside as much as possible.

159
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,083
If you see any suspicious people or behavior...

160
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,952
... report it to the authorities immediately.

161
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:14,927
Status.

162
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:18,164
Some escaped underground.

163
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,767
But it's only a matter of time before they are rounded up.

164
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,502
Tell me in more detail.

165
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,304
When, exactly?

166
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,106
Well...

167
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,110
...you see...

168
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:35,047
How many times are you going to make the same mistake?

169
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:42,121
We should have become a member of the United Nations five years ago.

170
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,490
And by now be a respected member...

171
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:48,761
...of the international community in our role as an EU nation.

172
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:51,564
But before that could happen...

173
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:54,800
...another group came crawling out of the sewers...

174
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:58,604
...screaming their declarations of separatism.

175
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,439
And the main cause of this...

176
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:05,878
...is because you allowed the terrorists to do as they please.

177
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,481
If we don't act soon...

178
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:14,854
...we will lose our chance for true independence forever.

179
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:18,057
And we cannot allow that to happen...

180
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,659
...at any cost.

181
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,065
Madam President.

182
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,633
Your visitor has arrived.

183
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,101
Show her in.

184
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,478
Welcome to Eastern Slav, my dear.

185
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,814
I am President Svetlana Belikova.

186
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:46,018
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce you to our guest.

187
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,621
This young lady is a special investigator...

188
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:52,992
...for the United Nations' Bioterrorism Security Alliance.

189
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,661
Good day, Madam President.

190
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,062
Gentlemen.

191
00:14:57,196 --> 00:15:00,266
I have been sent here by the BSAA.

192
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,701
My name is Ada Wong.

193
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,551
Hey, you.

194
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,688
My name is not, \"Hey, you.\"

195
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,623
I'm JD.

196
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,559
Although that's not my real name.

197
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:30,195
The old man's not looking too good.

198
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,065
He always looks like that.

199
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,201
Let's hope you're right.

200
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,943
Anyways, what are you really doing in this country?

201
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,578
Hey, a different question for a change.

202
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,013
What I mean is...

203
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,115
...being in America is a lot more fun than...

204
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,617
...being here, right?

205
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,818
I wouldn't know.

206
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,620
The hamburgers, man.

207
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:55,955
The fried chicken.

208
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,756
Food in your country's fantastic.

209
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,525
I could eat it every day.

210
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,827
Thanks for the valuable insight.

211
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,729
And the Hollywood movies.

212
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,130
I love those things.

213
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,066
I have 50 DVDs.

214
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,667
None of them are pirated.

215
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,203
I thought you guys hated America.

216
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,072
Sure, we hate it.

217
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,641
But things made in America?

218
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,242
Now that's different.

219
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,821
Whatever you do...

220
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,856
...don't push that button.

221
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,225
I'm not falling for that.

222
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,728
No way I'll allow them to trace the call.

223
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,471
How are things out there?

224
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:48,507
Looks like they have the old part of the city surrounded.

225
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,176
We'd better wait and see how things pan out.

226
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,646
Bio Organic Weapons.

227
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,215
Also known as...

228
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,816
...B.O.W.s.

229
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,220
Most developed countries and the United Nations...

230
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,723
...are against the use and manufacture of B.O.W.s.

231
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,426
However, they are, unfortunately...

232
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,362
...still traded on the world's black markets.

233
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,664
From a quick glance at this report...

234
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,235
...I'd say that using these weapons in a real conflict...

235
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,704
...would be extremely impractical, no?

236
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,839
There's no way to differentiate...

237
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,975
...between friend and foe.

238
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,110
It is true that total control...

239
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,346
...of most of the B.O.W.s...

240
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:30,516
...has been nearly impossible up until now.

241
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:34,353
But a new technology that changes that fact...

242
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:37,156
...has recently been developed.

243
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,159
Tell me more.

244
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,361
Recent technological advancements...

245
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:46,365
...can establish a master/slave relationship...

246
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:49,868
...between a human and the B.O.W.s.

247
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,303
So?

248
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,704
What do they do, crack whips at it?

249
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,873
Like they do with wild animals?

250
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,178
Not exactly.

251
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,780
Organisms, designed to determine...

252
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:06,418
...whether a host is to be a controller or a controlee...

253
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,688
...take up residence within the host's body...

254
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:13,792
...and creates the perfect master/slave relationship...

255
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,828
...between a human and the B.O.W.

256
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,230
Similar to the relationship...

257
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:21,133
...a queen bee shares with her worker bees.

258
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,616
Yo, bro. Can I speak to you for a moment?

259
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:38,884
What about?

260
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,686
It's about Ataman.

261
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,955
It could be dangerous to move him now.

262
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:46,925
And your American friend's also taken quite an interest in him.

263
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,730
You don't...

264
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:55,501
You don't have to worry about me.

265
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,936
We can't stay here forever.

266
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,881
Who's in there? Open the door.

267
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,916
Open the door. Anyone there?

268
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,918
Open up! Stop resisting...

269
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,720
...and come out. - Step back.

270
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:15,988
Three, two...

271
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:17,356
...one!

272
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,029
Don't move. Hands in the air. Don't move.

273
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,964
Don't shoot. Stay still.

274
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,067
Drop your guns!

275
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,969
Let's go. Take them away.

276
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,554
Keep away from him!

277
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,527
He's turned.

278
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,956
Downstairs.

279
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,524
Someone's in the basement.

280
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,160
Shoot. Shoot!

281
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,295
Quick, run!

282
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,593
Are you all right?

283
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,028
Ataman.

284
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,100
We have to hurry.

285
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,868
They'll be here soon.

286
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,169
You...

287
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,839
...go on ahead.

288
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,908
Damn, just when things were going well.

289
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,178
We can win this war...

290
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:21,780
...can't we?

291
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:23,048
JD.

292
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,384
It's... It's time...

293
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:28,120
...for me to go.

294
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:29,955
But I'll be rooting for you...

295
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,090
...from heaven.

296
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,329
Get up, you idiot. You think that vest

297
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,898
you're wearing is a girl's blouse?

298
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:42,601
We have to get Ataman away from here.

299
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,039
I should have guessed.

300
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,107
Made in America.

301
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,043
Wait.

302
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,477
Where's the American?

303
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,112
Dead, probably.

304
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,018
Give me a hand.

305
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,120
Leave me here.

306
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,125
If we go on like this...

307
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,228
...we'll all be killed...

308
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,164
...before we can launch an attack...

309
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:14,132
...on the capital.

310
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:20,906
Go.

311
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:25,143
Create a new future.

312
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,998
This way. I heard gunshots.

313
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,533
They're here.

314
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,037
I'm going to go and check on Marco.

315
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,974
You head to the church and join the others.

316
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:31,877
Okay.

317
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:20,318
Do you really think I'm gonna fall for that?

318
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:27,926
Kill you.

319
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,327
Do I look like I need a pruning?

320
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:34,699
Don't kill him.

321
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,801
That's one request I can't grant.

322
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,140
Mr. Chenkov.

323
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,810
I told you not to kill him.

324
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:46,878
He was my teacher.

325
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,480
It was him or me.

326
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:49,948
And don't forget...

327
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,250
...he wasn't your teacher anymore.

328
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:12,370
Shoot.

329
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:17,976
Shoot, JD.

330
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:13,164
Why the hell carry that gun around if you're not gonna use it?

331
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,635
Don't worry.

332
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,770
I'll use it next time.

333
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,721
If you ever decide to shoot those things,

334
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,024
shoot them in the head, got it?

335
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:41,459
Wait.

336
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,162
This way.

337
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,492
Two grown men should be able to open it.

338
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,163
So, what is this place?

339
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:21,566
Old partisans used to hole up here...

340
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,967
...back in the day.

341
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:25,637
They sure knew how to keep the enemy out.

342
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,505
This thing ain't gonna budge.

343
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,842
Stand back.

344
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,518
That way.

345
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,060
This way.

346
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:10,515
Quick.

347
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,565
Oh, I knew I should have...

348
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:28,867
...stayed off the...

349
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,535
...junk food.

350
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:36,574
Hurry up.

351
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,845
No. Get him.

352
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:49,013
Get away.

353
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,481
Get him.

354
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:51,616
Stay away from me.

355
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,651
Get him.

356
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,088
No.

357
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:59,424
No. No!

358
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:00,625
Get him.

359
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:05,797
Please, somebody help me. Help me!

360
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,732
What's happening?

361
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,134
Stay away! No!

362
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,706
Get away!

363
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,074
Help!

364
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,410
What happened to everybody?

365
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,047
Anywhere we can hide?

366
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:32,750
Hey.

367
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:36,220
Yeah.

368
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:21,432
What did you do to everybody?

369
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,568
The Plaga you were hiding got loose.

370
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,670
I don't know what you're talking about!

371
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:29,107
Your precious townsfolk are being controlled by a parasite.

372
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,009
It attaches itself to the central

373
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:33,044
nervous system via the spinal cord.

374
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,879
The people of the town are...?

375
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,215
They'll never be normal again.

376
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:40,118
There must be something we can do.

377
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,786
Rip out the spinal cord...

378
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,056
...but the best you could hope for is paralysis or death.

379
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,858
You are lying!

380
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:50,094
If you really believe that, then why did you kill the old man?

381
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:51,629
But that was...

382
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:55,533
Because you knew he would never be human again.

383
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,504
What he says is true.

384
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:05,743
I have some more questions for you.

385
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,358
Maybe this time we can get to the truth.

386
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,677
What are we going to do?

387
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:42,814
I have to go and get it.

388
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:44,082
Go and get it?

389
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,349
Why?

390
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:48,853
We need somebody to take over for Ataman.

391
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:52,156
You've seen what's happening outside.

392
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,392
Do you want that to happen to you?

393
00:34:57,862 --> 00:35:01,332
What we do today will carry the country into tomorrow.

394
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:05,903
But even so...

395
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,573
I'll meet up with the others tomorrow to plan...

396
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:10,908
...an attack on the Presidential Palace.

397
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:14,712
Get ready for that.

398
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:22,920
I'll be back soon.

399
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:57,955
I want a word with him.

400
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,697
He's gone to get it.

401
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:07,865
The Plaga?

402
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,433
I don't know its name.

403
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:13,538
All I know is that it was given to us by the elders.

404
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:27,752
You inject that stuff into your body to control the Lickers, right?

405
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:30,054
Some compassionate elders you got there.

406
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,856
What other options do we have?

407
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:34,659
Do you realize that the whole world ignores us?

408
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,994
That we are in danger of extermination?

409
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,363
Save your breath.

410
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,999
We're not gonna see eye to eye on this.

411
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,236
Help us.

412
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,640
I don't want to see him change into a monster.

413
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:54,011
Irina would not be happy about this.

414
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:57,548
Irina?

415
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:01,118
We knew her since we were kids.

416
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:03,821
Buddy's fiancee.

417
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:07,158
She was a schoolteacher and believe it or not...

418
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,994
...so was Buddy.

419
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:11,762
Bastards thought their school...

420
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,765
...was a pro-independence hideout and attacked it.

421
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,268
Irina and the kids died in the attack.

422
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,822
iThat's the reason iwhy he's fighting this war.

423
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:47,064
iHe had never even held ia gun up until then.

424
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,992
I'm going to pretend you escaped.

425
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:19,397
In return, you must get ahold of it before he does.

426
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:23,501
So now you trust me?

427
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,070
I don't know who or what you are...

428
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:29,040
...but I do know that you saved my life.

429
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,544
You must stop Sasha.

430
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,654
You'll find him in the central marketplace.

431
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:26,931
Everyone, evacuate immediately.

432
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:29,834
The operation begins at 2000 hours.

433
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:32,636
Everyone, evacuate immediately.

434
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:17,782
Looking for someone?

435
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:27,892
Ada.

436
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:39,236
It's been a long time, Leon.

437
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:42,506
What are you doing here?

438
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:47,578
I was about to ask you the same thing.

439
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,547
Did you release the Plaga?

440
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,116
Don't make me laugh.

441
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:55,986
I'm not interested in defective products.

442
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,255
I'm just here to lend them a hand.

443
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,124
Them?

444
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:03,327
Although it seems as if my help wasn't needed.

445
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,696
What are you doing here?

446
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,131
If they attack the capital...

447
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,700
...it'll make my job a lot easier.

448
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:11,268
That's all.

449
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:14,104
By the way...

450
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:17,741
...when are we going to carry on...

451
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,077
...from where we left off that night?

452
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,848
Any time but now.

453
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:27,284
You're angry with me, aren't you?

454
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:29,587
Suits you.

455
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,260
Quick word of warning.

456
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:38,596
This town will be purged soon!

457
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,671
Women.

458
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,417
General?

459
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:01,952
Yes.

460
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:07,458
You may start the attack when you are ready.

461
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:08,926
Thank you.

462
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:15,933
Bring Ada Wong to me. She should see this.

463
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:52,369
Great. I get to play Santa Claus.

464
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:49,293
Are you all right?

465
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:52,096
Yeah, just let my guard down for a moment.

466
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:00,738
They got us pretty good.

467
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,385
Where's Buddy?

468
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:16,186
He already left by the time I got there.

469
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,321
Damn!

470
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:18,689
We have to leave now.

471
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,791
The military's gonna burn the whole area...

472
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:22,459
...and everything in it.

473
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:23,694
What?

474
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,129
We're out of time.

475
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,202
What's wrong?

476
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:35,606
Nothing.

477
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:37,975
There's just something I have to do.

478
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:04,735
Won't you be needing that?

479
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,786
You my man.

480
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,424
Buddy.

481
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:33,497
Cool. You're still human.

482
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:35,966
JD.

483
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:39,837
You. What have you done?

484
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:43,540
No. He's not our enemy. He's...

485
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:45,542
I'm fine. Just go.

486
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:50,414
I don't want to cause any more trouble.

487
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:55,319
It's time to say goodbye.

488
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:10,400
JD!

489
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,571
Wait.

490
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:32,589
You know, I didn't really care about independence.

491
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:38,228
All I wanted was to have fun with you and my friends.

492
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:39,596
And...

493
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,488
I was looking forward to showing you America.

494
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:20,437
Trust me...

495
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:23,440
...I've seen this happen every time.

496
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,018
When you're dealing with B.O.W.s...

497
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:38,088
...there's no difference between friend or enemy.

498
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:40,390
It takes everything from you...

499
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,693
...the cause you're fighting for,

500
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:44,661
the respect you have for others.

501
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:49,099
We have to keep this from ever happening again.

502
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,236
Give me the Plaga.

503
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:59,610
As far as I am concerned...

504
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:04,414
...there is no difference between this and using B.O.W.s.

505
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:15,626
If you want to keep this from happening again...

506
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:18,929
...put down your gun.

507
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:25,002
Well, then.

508
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:27,304
That is my answer...

509
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:29,706
...and your answer.

510
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:57,567
The eradication of the B.O.W.s is moving ahead according to plan.

511
00:48:57,701 --> 00:49:01,438
You mustn't allow even one of them to escape the city.

512
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:04,107
We are prepared for all eventualities, madam.

513
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:07,778
And one more thing, regarding Ada Wong.

514
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:09,579
Did you find anything out?

515
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:13,383
There is no one working for the BSAA by the name of Ada Wong.

516
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:15,986
Are you serious?

517
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,988
Yes, madam.

518
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:22,759
Of course.

519
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:41,912
Central gate.

520
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:43,046
Report your status.

521
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,881
Central gate reporting.

522
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:46,750
- All is calm. - Roger.

523
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:48,785
Keep your eyes peeled.

524
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,991
Three trucks are approaching.

525
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:56,059
iHeads up, everyone.

526
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:09,339
Halt. Halt.

527
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:53,316
Where did you go last night?

528
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,419
You were not in the hotel.

529
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,722
I went to meet an old friend.

530
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:01,124
And this old friend...

531
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:04,294
...is he a spy?

532
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:12,502
Who are you working for? The Russians?

533
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:14,237
The Americans?

534
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:16,773
I'll leave that to your imagination.

535
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:20,644
Considering that you will never be leaving this country again...

536
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:24,881
...I would say it is in your best interests to stay on my good side.

537
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:30,587
Very funny.

538
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:27,944
So it's true what they said about you being a former instructor.

539
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:32,849
Former? I still am an instructor.

540
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:20,830
Yes?

541
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:24,267
The terrorists broke through the central gate.

542
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:35,011
As I said, we have decided to delay your departure.

543
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:36,846
Permanently.

544
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:52,662
Now, that's impressive.

545
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:22,993
I keep saying these things make bad pets.

546
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:33,270
We are under attack by terrorists.

547
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:35,639
We need reinforcements, now!

548
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,942
We can't defend the palace much longer.

549
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:30,487
Sorry, but I don't have time to stay and chat right now.

550
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,069
Amateurs.

551
00:57:20,203 --> 00:57:22,739
They didn't even give me a pat-down.

552
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:46,796
I didn't expect to get into this place so easily.

553
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:35,712
Pretty impressive for...

554
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,313
...an old nuclear shelter.

555
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,227
So you missed me?

556
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:55,632
Yeah. In your dreams.

557
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:58,334
You seeing what I'm seeing?

558
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:03,339
It's like a beehive.

559
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:16,686
Have you looked inside one of these?

560
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:22,792
It's the Plaga.

561
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:27,196
Big surprise.

562
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:34,337
Workers have been cultivated in the past.

563
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:37,106
But this...

564
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,176
This is the first time that the dominant members...

565
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:43,379
...of the species have been cultured.

566
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:46,215
What are you doing?

567
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:49,452
I'm working. Don't worry about it.

568
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,553
Oh, I'm worried.

569
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:52,355
Enough!

570
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:05,234
So this is what you're here for.

571
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:06,502
Well?

572
01:00:06,636 --> 01:00:07,570
Are you satisfied?

573
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:11,240
Yes, thank you very much.

574
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:13,409
Who is he?

575
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:14,911
I don't know.

576
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:17,246
He's an American agent.

577
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:20,416
Well, now that we got that out of the way...

578
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:22,952
An American?

579
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:25,989
You'd better watch out...

580
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,391
...old broad's got a bite worse than her bark.

581
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:29,759
Say what?

582
01:00:34,731 --> 01:00:37,233
Over there! Over there! Shoot!

583
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:40,970
Cease fire! Cease fire!

584
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:44,107
Cease fire!

585
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,290
Don't move.

586
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,703
Do you have any idea...

587
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,472
...who you are pointing your gun at?

588
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:18,808
Yeah, let me see.

589
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,877
You're the beekeeper.

590
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,412
The beekeeper?

591
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:26,315
The person who released the Plaga.

592
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:30,319
Just as I thought, you haven't a clue.

593
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:34,490
I am the president of this country.

594
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:55,078
So that's what Ada meant.

595
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:58,514
He is an enemy of the state. Kill him!

596
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:16,199
Creatures broke through...

597
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:19,001
... the cargo entrance! They're heading your way!

598
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:52,401
Open fire!

599
01:02:57,874 --> 01:03:00,543
Cease fire. Cease fire.

600
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:40,616
Help me!

601
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:51,127
Fall back!

602
01:04:12,715 --> 01:04:14,217
Did you use it?

603
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:17,386
Get him.

604
01:04:56,926 --> 01:04:58,160
I'm sorry.

605
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:00,963
I couldn't stop him.

606
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:42,271
You bastard!

607
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:45,741
Help!

608
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:42,932
What will you gain by killing me?

609
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:44,633
Have you thought this through?

610
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:48,738
Who will lead the country once you gain independence?

611
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:50,206
You?

612
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:53,075
I have no intention of taking advice...

613
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:55,945
...from a pretender to the throne.

614
01:06:56,078 --> 01:06:57,713
In case you're interested...

615
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:01,183
...all of the elders, with the exception of Ataman...

616
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:05,221
...have already come over to my side.

617
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:09,058
They all said they would be happy to renege on independence...

618
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:12,261
...once I promised to share the oil profits with them.

619
01:07:12,395 --> 01:07:14,430
That's not possible.

620
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:17,800
Yes, that's what I thought.

621
01:07:17,933 --> 01:07:20,469
But I'm afraid it's true.

622
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:22,471
Shut up!

623
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:28,044
While we have been wasting time here,

624
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:30,479
things have been happening in the world.

625
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:36,819
We don't have time to fight amongst ourselves...

626
01:07:36,952 --> 01:07:39,855
...in this tiny little country.

627
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:43,125
Shut up!

628
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:05,714
Oh, great. It just keeps getting better.

629
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:30,206
We have to go.

630
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:38,314
Svetlana!

631
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:49,091
A biohazard release has been detected.

632
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:51,427
Evacuate. Evacuate.

633
01:08:52,895 --> 01:08:57,833
The incineration of the facility will begin shortly.

634
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:21,016
Run!

635
01:10:59,288 --> 01:11:01,323
Why is it doing that?

636
01:11:04,994 --> 01:11:07,062
You owe me one.

637
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:57,079
Why are you helping me?

638
01:11:57,212 --> 01:12:00,449
Don't get all sentimental on me.

639
01:12:00,582 --> 01:12:02,685
I'm not doing this for you.

640
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:06,322
There's nobody else left to tell the world

641
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:09,124
what really happened, that's why.

642
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:20,135
The hatch!

643
01:12:36,385 --> 01:12:38,153
This will take us up.

644
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:48,097
Damn it.

645
01:12:49,331 --> 01:12:50,833
Hurry.

646
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:56,839
Come on.

647
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:21,163
Let's get going.

648
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:38,247
This is an announcement...

649
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:41,116
... from the government of the Eastern Slav Republic.

650
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:44,219
We are under attack by terrorists.

651
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:45,654
Biochemical weapons...

652
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:47,456
... may have been used.

653
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:50,692
You are ordered to evacuate the city immediately.

654
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:53,662
Please keep a distance of five kilometers...

655
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:55,497
... from the capital.

656
01:13:58,233 --> 01:13:59,401
Excuse me.

657
01:13:59,535 --> 01:14:01,804
Yes, what is it?

658
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:04,006
Forces have been evacuated from the city...

659
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:07,109
...to escape the B.O.W.s released by the terrorists.

660
01:14:07,242 --> 01:14:12,247
However it appears the two in the shelter have managed to escape.

661
01:14:13,816 --> 01:14:16,785
Why are you wasting my time telling me this?

662
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:19,888
Just let the you-know-what get rid of them.

663
01:14:20,022 --> 01:14:22,257
I'll see to it immediately.

664
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:35,270
Help me!

665
01:17:06,588 --> 01:17:08,790
Nice work, pal.

666
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:09,217
Get out of there!

667
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:50,826
You really shouldn't have done that.

668
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:32,527
You really want to fight this out, huh?

669
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,578
Sorry for butting in.

670
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:04,226
You can run, but you can't hide.

671
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:11,666
Come on. Don't be shy.

672
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:27,682
Now!

673
01:21:28,817 --> 01:21:30,385
This might hurt a little.

674
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:14,462
I didn't expect to be saved...

675
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:16,197
...by B.O.W.s.

676
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:34,582
Wanna go grab a few beers?

677
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:38,153
Are you buying?

678
01:22:40,088 --> 01:22:42,624
You'll have to go without me.

679
01:22:56,771 --> 01:22:59,307
Can't they find anybody else to play with?

680
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:03,345
Why don't you go without me?

681
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:05,380
I like the company.

682
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:11,419
We'd better move a little faster.

683
01:23:20,862 --> 01:23:22,731
Today the capital...

684
01:23:22,864 --> 01:23:26,601
... was subjected to a powerful attack launched by terrorists.

685
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:29,337
They struck with fearsome weapons...

686
01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:32,173
... of mass destruction known as B.O.W.s...

687
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:35,810
... which have been banned iinternationally.

688
01:23:36,811 --> 01:23:40,348
We as a country desire nothing more...

689
01:23:40,482 --> 01:23:42,684
...than to live in peace.

690
01:23:42,817 --> 01:23:46,388
Together with the elders of the anti-government movement...

691
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:51,393
...who, might I add, graciously listened to our pleas...

692
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:54,529
...have managed to avert the most serious crisis...

693
01:23:54,662 --> 01:23:56,998
...in the history of our nation.

694
01:23:57,132 --> 01:24:02,303
I believe this is undeniable proof that as a country...

695
01:24:02,437 --> 01:24:03,738
...as a people...

696
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:06,441
...we are suitable for full acceptance

697
01:24:06,574 --> 01:24:09,210
into the international community.

698
01:24:10,011 --> 01:24:11,646
As leader...

699
01:24:15,016 --> 01:24:16,785
Something wrong?

700
01:24:16,918 --> 01:24:18,620
I don't need this.

701
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:20,655
I'll improvise.

702
01:24:24,759 --> 01:24:26,661
What about the elders?

703
01:24:26,795 --> 01:24:31,833
It's over. All of them. A little while ago.

704
01:24:31,966 --> 01:24:36,738
I suppose I should mention that during the press conference...

705
01:24:36,871 --> 01:24:41,076
...that the terrorists executed the elders...

706
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:42,944
...as traitors.

707
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:44,779
Yes, madam.

708
01:24:45,447 --> 01:24:47,515
Is there anything else?

709
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:50,151
I've already contacted the BSAA and Interpol...

710
01:24:50,285 --> 01:24:53,755
...with regard to the damage we sustained because of Ada Wong.

711
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:57,759
An international warrant for her arrest will be issued soon.

712
01:24:57,892 --> 01:25:01,029
A few of the terrorists managed to escape the city...

713
01:25:01,162 --> 01:25:03,164
...but you don't have to worry about them.

714
01:25:03,298 --> 01:25:05,834
What about the other two?

715
01:25:05,967 --> 01:25:08,403
It's just a matter of time.

716
01:25:08,536 --> 01:25:12,140
Finally, there is no one left to stop us.

717
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:14,609
That's right, Madam President.

718
01:25:14,742 --> 01:25:17,712
Very well, let's start the press conference immediately.

719
01:25:17,846 --> 01:25:20,215
Yes, of course, Madam President.

720
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:29,891
At last...

721
01:25:30,024 --> 01:25:32,927
...a new tomorrow begins.

722
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:02,250
They were keeping an eye on me the whole time.

723
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:10,425
On air in five, four, three...

724
01:27:11,793 --> 01:27:14,028
Good evening. I am President...

725
01:27:14,162 --> 01:27:15,897
Madam President.

726
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:18,533
We're under attack by the Americans and Russians.

727
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:21,269
What? It can't be.

728
01:27:49,397 --> 01:27:51,799
Stay down, you dogs.

729
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:53,368
Stay still.

730
01:27:53,501 --> 01:27:55,236
Move. Keep them away.

731
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:57,438
Move! Move!

732
01:27:57,572 --> 01:27:59,040
Hands in the air!

733
01:27:59,173 --> 01:28:00,475
Help me.

734
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,062
So...

735
01:28:21,195 --> 01:28:24,432
The Americans and Russians had us in the palms of their hands...

736
01:28:24,565 --> 01:28:26,401
...from the beginning.

737
01:28:27,502 --> 01:28:29,604
That's what it looks like.

738
01:28:30,271 --> 01:28:32,106
Did you know about this?

739
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:36,010
No.

740
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:39,514
If I did, I'd still be enjoying my vacation.

741
01:28:43,918 --> 01:28:45,119
Hey.

742
01:29:10,712 --> 01:29:13,014
I've lost everything.

743
01:29:15,083 --> 01:29:16,918
My mentor...

744
01:29:17,051 --> 01:29:18,786
...my friends.

745
01:29:26,928 --> 01:29:29,697
I have nothing left to fight for.

746
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:37,872
Kill me.

747
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:40,842
Please.

748
01:29:40,975 --> 01:29:44,178
I don't want to change into one of those monsters.

749
01:30:06,033 --> 01:30:07,168
Well...

750
01:30:07,301 --> 01:30:10,171
...I guess there is no other choice.

751
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:32,226
I'd feel the same way if I was you.

752
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:39,200
But the option of taking our own lives no longer belongs to us.

753
01:30:43,704 --> 01:30:45,773
Once we start using these, we owe it

754
01:30:45,907 --> 01:30:48,242
to the people who died alongside us.

755
01:30:48,376 --> 01:30:50,478
We have to continue living.

756
01:30:58,052 --> 01:31:00,087
Even if it means living the rest of our

757
01:31:00,221 --> 01:31:02,490
lives without the use of our limbs.

758
01:31:09,397 --> 01:31:11,499
That is my answer...

759
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:14,068
...and your answer...

760
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:17,505
...Buddy.

761
01:31:30,218 --> 01:31:33,087
It's been three days since the end of the civil war...

762
01:31:33,221 --> 01:31:36,123
... that tore through the Eastern Slav Republic.

763
01:31:36,257 --> 01:31:37,558
The fierce battles...

764
01:31:37,692 --> 01:31:39,727
... were halted thanks to the intervention

765
01:31:39,861 --> 01:31:41,996
of American and Russian troops.

766
01:31:42,129 --> 01:31:44,065
iToday marks the first day...

767
01:31:44,198 --> 01:31:46,567
... in which the world's media has access to the city.

768
01:31:46,701 --> 01:31:49,971
A temporary government headed by the U.S. And Russia...

769
01:31:50,104 --> 01:31:51,973
... will be set up in the Eastern

770
01:31:52,106 --> 01:31:54,008
Slav Republic to maintain peace.

771
01:31:54,141 --> 01:31:57,345
Svetlana Belikova has resigned from her presidency...

772
01:31:57,478 --> 01:31:59,080
... and companies that supported her

773
01:31:59,213 --> 01:32:01,249
and the former government...

774
01:32:01,382 --> 01:32:04,585
... will be thrown out of the country iand dismantled.

775
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:08,322
Top brass knew about it right from the beginning, didn't they?

776
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:14,962
The report from Scarecrow tipped them off...

777
01:32:15,096 --> 01:32:18,165
...that Svetlana was in possession of B.O.W.s.

778
01:32:18,299 --> 01:32:20,234
That's why they pulled out in a panic...

779
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:23,337
...and ran like hell to join forces with the Russians.

780
01:32:24,572 --> 01:32:27,441
To protect themselves, right?

781
01:32:27,575 --> 01:32:28,776
You're mistaken.

782
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:31,245
The president had nothing to do with this.

783
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:35,783
Not even we knew what was going on. You have to believe me.

784
01:32:38,486 --> 01:32:39,854
Leon.

785
01:32:39,987 --> 01:32:43,357
- Don't... - I'm not going anywhere.

786
01:32:47,161 --> 01:32:51,065
In the end, nothing's really changed.

787
01:33:10,184 --> 01:33:12,286
Everything went according to plan.

788
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:14,455
The facility has been destroyed...

789
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:17,625
... and I salvaged the cultivated Plaga.

790
01:33:18,526 --> 01:33:21,295
But I haven't decided...

791
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:24,065
... whether or not I should send it to you.

792
01:33:28,603 --> 01:33:29,804
Really?

793
01:33:29,937 --> 01:33:33,174
Thank you. That's very kind.

794
01:33:33,307 --> 01:33:36,110
Although, I sort of liked the idea...

795
01:33:36,243 --> 01:33:38,145
... of adding an international

796
01:33:38,279 --> 01:33:40,381
arrest warrant to my profile.

797
01:34:21,622 --> 01:34:23,257
What are you doing?

798
01:34:24,125 --> 01:34:25,559
You're going to get in trouble.

799
01:34:25,693 --> 01:34:27,328
Did you do yours?

800
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:33,401
Hi. Morning.

801
01:34:33,534 --> 01:34:34,602
Good morning.

802
01:34:34,735 --> 01:34:36,203
Morning.

803
01:34:49,417 --> 01:34:53,020
Oh, come on, let's go, we're gonna be late.

804
01:34:55,890 --> 01:34:57,491
Morning.
