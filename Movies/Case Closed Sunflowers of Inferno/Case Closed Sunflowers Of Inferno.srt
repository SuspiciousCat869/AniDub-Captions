1
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:24,930
And now, the crown jewel of today's auction.

2
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:29,091
A masterpiece that brings pride to all of humanity.

3
00:00:29,457 --> 00:00:30,912
Thought to be lost forever...

4
00:00:31,286 --> 00:00:35,130
Vincent Van Gogh's beautiful, "Sunflowers"!

5
00:00:38,855 --> 00:00:41,493
No way, the lost "Sunflowers"?!

6
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,917
I thought it was destroyed in the last great war?

7
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:45,537
Quiet down, please!

8
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:48,223
We have a specialist on hand that can explain.

9
00:00:49,922 --> 00:00:54,506
It's believed that Van Gogh created seven
"Sunflowers" paintings when he was in Arles.

10
00:00:56,836 --> 00:01:00,546
The second painting in the classic
series is what's being presented here today.

11
00:01:00,664 --> 00:01:06,140
It was believed to have been destroyed in
1945 during an air raid in Ashiya, Japan.

12
00:01:06,552 --> 00:01:10,293
But a painting with the same
composition was found in Arles last year.

13
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,075
Master appraisers have examined the piece,

14
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:18,640
and have undoubtedly verified that this is
indeed an original work of Vincent Van Gogh.

15
00:01:19,214 --> 00:01:24,030
All right! How about we breathe some
life into these once lost "Sunflowers"!

16
00:01:25,673 --> 00:01:30,550
Presenting Vincent Van Gogh's
masterpiece, the second "Sunflowers"!

17
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:33,290
The bidding will begin at 10 million dollars!

18
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:35,615
Seriously? 10 million?

19
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:38,546
And it's going up 100,000 each bid.

20
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:42,373
If I had that kind of money, I'd
rather spend it on a trip to space.

21
00:01:44,194 --> 00:01:47,862
20 mil by phone... And a 20.5 mil online!

22
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,308
50 million!

23
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,337
Huh?

24
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,356
It's that famous buyer...

25
00:01:55,332 --> 00:01:56,500
One hundred million.

26
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,064
Huh?!

27
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:03,119
Did I stutter? I said 100 million!

28
00:02:03,286 --> 00:02:04,747
One hundred million!

29
00:02:05,032 --> 00:02:08,185
Do I hear 110 million? 110 million, anyone?

30
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,292
Damn it. Who is that bald old man in the back there?

31
00:02:11,356 --> 00:02:12,598
What do you want to do now? - And now 120!

32
00:02:12,685 --> 00:02:15,200
Ugh, looks like we'll have to go to 200.

33
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:16,098
All right...

34
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,175
200 million!

35
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,039
Huh?

36
00:02:18,547 --> 00:02:19,380
Suzuki is here!

37
00:02:19,404 --> 00:02:20,976
Yes! Two hundred million!

38
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:26,652
Um, if I heard correctly, #705
has just bid 200 million dollars.

39
00:02:27,903 --> 00:02:29,659
So he's the infamous...

40
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,359
Mr. Suzuki!

41
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,572
Uuh, we're a little behind with our online bidding...

42
00:02:34,597 --> 00:02:37,188
Um, hey Uncle, they all think we're crazy.

43
00:02:37,442 --> 00:02:40,318
I prefer not to waste my precious time.

44
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,876
His time is precious, hehe.

45
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:43,868
Huh?

46
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,401
Forget about those online bids!

47
00:02:46,426 --> 00:02:46,888
Huh?

48
00:02:48,636 --> 00:02:49,216
Hmph.

49
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:52,401
Three hundred.

50
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,284
Huh?! Ugh...

51
00:02:54,455 --> 00:02:56,563
Three hundred million dollars!

52
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,555
That's hammer price! Hammer price!

53
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:02,783
Sold for 300 million!

54
00:03:04,763 --> 00:03:05,741
Van Gogh's lost painting, "Sunflowers" has been sold,

55
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,162
Conan! It's about to start!

56
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:07,818
All right.

57
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,047
Hurry, hurry!

58
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,586
So whatcha got there?

59
00:03:12,618 --> 00:03:14,886
What is it? Some kind of robot or something?

60
00:03:14,997 --> 00:03:16,562
Turn it on already, Doc!

61
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,686
Hold down, the most important past isn't here yet!

62
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:24,364
So tell us, where has this painting been
all these years? Why has it suddenly surfaced?

63
00:03:24,462 --> 00:03:29,474
Scholars everywhere were under the impression that it
had been destroyed in an air raid during World War II.

64
00:03:29,688 --> 00:03:30,640
Destroyed?

65
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:33,651
So this is not the original painting, then?

66
00:03:33,857 --> 00:03:36,614
No, it's the original. Despite rumors to the contrary.
- Ah.

67
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:44,859
Stating that a painting thought to be a lost work of
Van Gogh's was discovered in Arles, France, last year.

68
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:49,706
Oh! Come to think of it, there was talk that it
was found in the attic of an old cottage, right?

69
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:52,530
Right, and it turned out to be the second Sunflowers.

70
00:03:52,623 --> 00:03:53,343
I see.

71
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,218
Now let's start!

72
00:03:54,243 --> 00:03:54,624
Ah...

73
00:03:54,649 --> 00:03:56,152
Wow, so cool!

74
00:03:56,263 --> 00:03:56,938
So cool!

75
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,439
This is the biggest one I could get!

76
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,660
Push these buttons here, and...

77
00:04:05,691 --> 00:04:07,264
Bet it makes grilled eel!

78
00:04:07,475 --> 00:04:09,125
I don't think that's possible.

79
00:04:10,308 --> 00:04:12,650
But how likely is it that this one's a fake?

80
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:15,719
The specialists are very careful in that regard,

81
00:04:15,814 --> 00:04:18,579
and did a thorough appraisal
of the piece before the auction.

82
00:04:19,254 --> 00:04:25,430
As a result, it was found that the canvas was the same
one that Van Gogh had used for other paintings in Arles.

83
00:04:25,696 --> 00:04:28,678
Better than grilled eel? Like grilled eel over rice!

84
00:04:28,797 --> 00:04:30,400
Why would you think that?

85
00:04:30,457 --> 00:04:32,236
Woah! It's coming out!

86
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:33,426
Huh?

87
00:04:33,715 --> 00:04:34,441
What's wrong?

88
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:35,457
It hasn't changed at all.

89
00:04:35,504 --> 00:04:37,116
What is this, another failure?

90
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:39,531
Just wait, you'll see.

91
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:42,340
Huh?

92
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:42,910
Oh.

93
00:04:43,804 --> 00:04:44,680
Woah!

94
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,815
Kamen Yaiba!

95
00:04:47,942 --> 00:04:48,618
Wow!

96
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:49,802
Cool!

97
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,343
It's Kamen Yaiba!

98
00:04:51,763 --> 00:04:52,508
Wow!

99
00:04:52,532 --> 00:04:54,077
Cool! How did you do that?!

100
00:04:54,102 --> 00:04:57,738
What are you doing, Doc? Don't
you have other stuff to make?

101
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,131
... may have been a forgery?

102
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:02,697
Well, considering all the facts, that's a possibility.

103
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:08,806
Moreover, some speculate that there were actually
8 painting, not 7 in Van Gogh's Sunflower series.

104
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,201
The "Sunflowers" sold at auction today,
and the "Sunflowers" that was in Ashiya,

105
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,643
may be two separate paintings with the exact
same image, both of them painted by Van Gogh himself.

106
00:05:19,182 --> 00:05:22,466
Would the original creator really
make a copy of their own work?

107
00:05:22,593 --> 00:05:27,897
Yes. Out of the 7 "Sunflowers" paintings that
we've been able to verify, 3 of them are copies.

108
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:29,503
And each was indeed painted, by Van Gogh.

109
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,792
Nothing against Van Gogh,

110
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:34,541
but shouldn't you show a little more
interest in the Doctor's work also?

111
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,796
His art deserves recognition too.

112
00:05:36,852 --> 00:05:38,941
Looks like he has enough of that already.

113
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:43,051
Ah, it seems the press conference is about to start.

114
00:05:43,273 --> 00:05:47,284
We now bring you a live broadcast of
the press conference happening in New York.

115
00:05:47,775 --> 00:05:50,836
Ehem. First, a few words from the winner of our auction.

116
00:05:50,946 --> 00:05:55,400
Jirokichi Suzuki, the proud new
owner of the second "Sunflowers"!

117
00:05:55,424 --> 00:05:56,086
Mm.

118
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:03,849
I'm glad to say that my plan to purchase the painting
with the highest possible bid was a resounding success.

119
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:04,509
Huh?

120
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:08,393
You mean you planned to pay 300
million dollars for the painting?

121
00:06:08,616 --> 00:06:09,665
That's correct.

122
00:06:09,805 --> 00:06:10,164
Hmph.

123
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:14,792
It was all so I can hold a
"Sunflowers" exhibition back in Japan.

124
00:06:14,816 --> 00:06:16,657
A "Sunflowers" exhibition?

125
00:06:16,773 --> 00:06:21,375
We, the Suzuki Financial Group, are pleased to
announce the "Sunflowers Long for Japan" Exhibit,

126
00:06:21,427 --> 00:06:23,189
at our Lake Rock Art Museum.

127
00:06:23,236 --> 00:06:26,220
The "Sunflowers" scattered all
around the world will finally

128
00:06:26,245 --> 00:06:29,560
be gathered into a single vase. We hope to see you there!

129
00:06:29,948 --> 00:06:34,144
Ms. Suzuki! With this purchase, how
many "Sunflowers" paintings will you have?

130
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:37,631
So then, winning this auction was
all part of this planned exhibit?

131
00:06:37,656 --> 00:06:42,400
Yeah! The perfect opportunity so we
could announce our exhibition to the world.

132
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:47,491
Including the "Sunflowers" from today, we
plan to gather and display the entire collection.

133
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,134
Huh?! All seven of them?

134
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:52,622
Well that possible, even for a Japanese conglomerate!

135
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:56,066
Don't you fret. The project is already well underway.

136
00:06:56,647 --> 00:07:01,780
We're happy to announce, we've made contact
with "Sunflowers" owners all over the world.

137
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,274
They know all about our desire to
exhibit the entire "Sunflowers" series.

138
00:07:06,623 --> 00:07:09,563
Thanks to getting the second
"Sunflowers" in today's auction,

139
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,948
museums and private collectors have
agreed to give us their complete cooperation!

140
00:07:15,846 --> 00:07:19,701
That's not all! We've hired seven elite specialists,

141
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:23,728
they'll tend to the paintings, supervise
their transport, and provide security.

142
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:25,967
Wow, seven specialists, huh?

143
00:07:26,158 --> 00:07:29,004
Hmph. You could say they're my seven samurai.

144
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:31,308
And I've brought them to join us!

145
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:38,766
So, this group is what you'd call your seven samurai?

146
00:07:38,814 --> 00:07:41,175
Exactly. They're the cream of the crop.

147
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:44,098
All of them are experts in their respective fields,

148
00:07:44,123 --> 00:07:47,467
and have trained in Van Gogh's
native homes of Holland and France.

149
00:07:47,546 --> 00:07:53,114
Starting from the left, we have Ms. Natsumi
Miyadai, overseeing art history and appraisals.

150
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,290
Glad to be here.

151
00:07:54,853 --> 00:08:01,060
Another art scholar, Mr. Koji Azuma, will be in
charge of restoration and preservation of the paintings.

152
00:08:02,084 --> 00:08:07,304
Next is Ms. Keiko Anderson, who'll be in
charge of exhibition planning and operations.

153
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:13,938
Mr. Taizo Ishimine, will be handling
transportation of the paintings.

154
00:08:13,963 --> 00:08:15,265
Call me Ishimine.

155
00:08:15,366 --> 00:08:20,668
Next we have Ms. Kumiko Kishi. She'll be
overseeing the staging of the "Sunflowers."

156
00:08:20,763 --> 00:08:23,660
I promise to make the exhibition a big success.

157
00:08:23,774 --> 00:08:26,801
And last but not least, we have lieutenant Charlie,

158
00:08:26,936 --> 00:08:30,309
on loan from the NYPD as our head of security.

159
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:32,993
I'll do my best to protect the "Sunflowers."

160
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,792
Let's see, didn't you mention you hired seven
samurai? But you've only introduced us to six of them.

161
00:08:39,205 --> 00:08:43,891
That's because the seventh member's in Japan,
where he'll be providing additional security.

162
00:08:44,622 --> 00:08:46,327
And his name's Mister...

163
00:08:47,018 --> 00:08:48,629
Kogoro Mori!

164
00:08:48,782 --> 00:08:52,338
Huh?! You mean the last one is Pops of all people?

165
00:08:52,424 --> 00:08:56,190
It's probably because he knows he gets
the "Kid Catcher" as part of the deal.

166
00:08:56,261 --> 00:08:56,815
Huh?

167
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:58,408
Best of luck Mr. Samurai.

168
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,639
Oh! Wow, check it out!

169
00:09:00,728 --> 00:09:02,718
Sonoko's on TV! How cool!

170
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,152
Wow! I wanna watch!

171
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:05,248
Let's all watch!

172
00:09:07,494 --> 00:09:13,469
Would you still exhibit the other Sunflowers, even if you
aren't able to gather all seven paintings in one place?

173
00:09:13,715 --> 00:09:16,680
No. It's either all of them, or none at all!

174
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,015
You can't be serious?!

175
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,191
Don't you worry.

176
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,464
I've long dreamed of holding a "Sunflowers" exhibit.

177
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:26,166
And when I have a dream, I always make sure it comes true!

178
00:09:26,658 --> 00:09:28,739
Huh...

179
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,037
Don't tell me that's...!

180
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:33,482
A Kid Card!

181
00:09:36,652 --> 00:09:38,592
Move back, he's got a gun!

182
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:40,490
Call security!

183
00:09:43,871 --> 00:09:45,041
Drop your gun!

184
00:09:45,436 --> 00:09:48,015
Didn't you hear me? I said, drop your gun!

185
00:09:48,636 --> 00:09:49,268
Hmph.

186
00:09:58,254 --> 00:09:59,099
No way!

187
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,266
I can't tell what's going on!

188
00:10:01,345 --> 00:10:02,769
Something must have happened!

189
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,785
Huh?!

190
00:10:06,025 --> 00:10:07,558
Look, it's Kid!

191
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:09,449
Hahaha!

192
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:23,471
Kid!

193
00:10:24,592 --> 00:10:25,088
Woah!

194
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,530
Ah!

195
00:10:26,307 --> 00:10:28,469
Freeze! Freeze or I'll sho...!

196
00:10:28,524 --> 00:10:29,907
Gah! Woah..!

197
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:33,339
Woah! Urk!

198
00:10:34,556 --> 00:10:34,960
Hup!

199
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,177
What the?!

200
00:10:39,788 --> 00:10:42,286
Freeze! Give yourself up!

201
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:47,675
You're surrounded! Don't move, there's no where to run!

202
00:10:50,905 --> 00:10:51,446
Kid!

203
00:10:51,803 --> 00:10:52,383
Hmph.

204
00:10:52,408 --> 00:10:54,378
Drop your weapon! Right now!

205
00:10:55,816 --> 00:10:59,758
Good. Now stay we you are and raise
both hands where I can seem them.

206
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:03,745
Hey! Do you hear me?! I said raise
both hands where I can see them!

207
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:06,686
Kid!

208
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,521
Good, slowly. Just like that.

209
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:23,982
Charlie! Stop shooting!!

210
00:11:31,726 --> 00:11:33,771
Damn you, Kid the Phantom Thief!

211
00:11:33,835 --> 00:11:35,074
He got away.

212
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:38,388
It was a chaotic scene but not
casualties have been reported.

213
00:11:38,703 --> 00:11:40,571
Oh no! It's over already?

214
00:11:40,739 --> 00:11:43,392
So what just happened? Did Kid steal the "Sunflowers"?

215
00:11:43,432 --> 00:11:47,737
It's weird cause Kid never goes after
paintings. He's only targeted jewels before!

216
00:11:48,887 --> 00:11:53,345
I only caught a glimpse, but was that really Kid?

217
00:11:58,754 --> 00:11:59,557
What?!

218
00:12:01,496 --> 00:12:02,782
Having some trouble?

219
00:12:02,858 --> 00:12:03,393
- Huh?!

220
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:05,667
What?! What the heck are you doing here?

221
00:12:05,937 --> 00:12:09,401
I came as soon as I heard that
Kid was after the "Sunflowers".

222
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,246
If you would like, I can be of some help.

223
00:12:38,099 --> 00:12:41,317
I'm Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.

224
00:12:41,506 --> 00:12:44,726
I went to an amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran.

225
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:49,549
And while we were there, we witnessed
some men in black making a dangerous deal.

226
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:52,266
Because I was so absorbed in watching them,

227
00:12:52,441 --> 00:12:55,294
I didn't notice the man who came at me from behind.

228
00:12:56,865 --> 00:13:01,323
He forced me to drink a poison that
knocked me out... and when I woke up...

229
00:13:01,863 --> 00:13:04,247
I discovered that my body had shrunk!

230
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:09,251
If those guys ever found out that Shinichi
Kudo was still alive, they'd come back.

231
00:13:09,441 --> 00:13:13,559
So on Dr. Agasa's advice, I
kept my real identity a secret.

232
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:18,038
When Ran asked me who I was, I quickly
made up the name, "Conan Edogawa."

233
00:13:18,221 --> 00:13:20,555
I knew if I wanted info on the men in black,

234
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:25,410
the smart thing would be to stay at her house
with her, and her dad who ran a detective agency.

235
00:13:25,498 --> 00:13:30,369
By the way, there are a few others
besides Doc that know my true identity.

236
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:34,938
Ai Haibara, her real name is Shiho Miyano.

237
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:40,468
She used to be a member of the Black Organization,
but she wanted out so she tried to kill herself...

238
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:44,821
Taking the exact same poison I was
given. And it shrank her body too.

239
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,498
And we can't forget...

240
00:13:49,277 --> 00:13:51,622
Kid the Phantom Thief and his assistant.

241
00:13:52,161 --> 00:13:54,529
Things haven't been settled between us yet.

242
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:58,317
But as a detective, someday I'll catch you!

243
00:13:59,835 --> 00:14:02,395
My body may have shrunk but my IQ hasn't!

244
00:14:02,514 --> 00:14:04,452
I will leave no case unsolved!

245
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:09,051
There is always only one truth!

246
00:14:13,923 --> 00:14:16,530
This plane will soon be landing in Haneda Airport.

247
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,551
Please make sure all baggage is in
the overhead bins or under your seats.

248
00:14:22,576 --> 00:14:26,430
If you have to use the restroom, do
so now before landing procedures begin.

249
00:14:27,374 --> 00:14:29,495
Here's the dummy we were able to retrieve.

250
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,768
Uh... Well you're a happy guy.

251
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:37,226
Uncle's always falling for those kinds of
tricks, he's just glad he's not the only one.

252
00:14:37,328 --> 00:14:38,249
Huh?!

253
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,435
By the way, are you sure about this?

254
00:14:41,205 --> 00:14:44,883
You won't even let a cabin attendant
in here unless there's an emergency,

255
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:47,546
but you're letting that kid come and go as he pleases?

256
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:51,422
Well, that's because he's a
detective that represents Japan.

257
00:14:51,818 --> 00:14:53,878
There's no need to worry about him at all.

258
00:14:53,957 --> 00:14:56,538
But how do you know he's not Kid in disguise?

259
00:14:56,657 --> 00:14:58,572
They do have the same features.

260
00:14:58,596 --> 00:14:59,009
Um.

261
00:14:59,127 --> 00:15:01,338
You've got too much time on your hands.

262
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:03,706
This oughta help. Watch carefully.

263
00:15:05,246 --> 00:15:05,921
Huh?!

264
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:07,185
What did I tell ya?

265
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:09,330
What the heck you old fart?!

266
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:12,072
Charlie thinks you look suspicious!

267
00:15:12,097 --> 00:15:15,310
What's that American even doing
on this plane in the first place?

268
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:18,436
You were supposed to escort "Sunflowers" to the airport.

269
00:15:18,498 --> 00:15:21,065
So why don't you tell me what you're still doing here?

270
00:15:21,223 --> 00:15:24,632
I may have been contracted as
security exclusively in America,

271
00:15:24,735 --> 00:15:30,296
but now we're certain Phantom Thief is going
after the painting, I couldn't leave this unfinished.

272
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:33,475
Aah, I knew you'd be a perfect samurai.

273
00:15:33,745 --> 00:15:36,060
Do what you must to protect "Sunflowers." - Hm.

274
00:15:36,106 --> 00:15:37,433
You can count on me, sir.

275
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:42,470
Now all we need is the Kid Catcher on
our team and we'll really be in business!

276
00:15:43,788 --> 00:15:45,226
Are you alright, Natsumi?

277
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,015
Yeah, I'm just a bit airsick.

278
00:15:48,204 --> 00:15:50,446
You can try to walk it off? That's what I'm doing.

279
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:53,172
Come on. It's not good to keep still for so long.

280
00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:54,961
I appreciate it.

281
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:57,016
Where are you headed?

282
00:15:57,405 --> 00:15:58,391
The restroom.

283
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:12,952
Hmm...

284
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,210
Come on, Kid's probably on the
look out for when they arrive.

285
00:16:18,428 --> 00:16:21,414
We told him not to make the plane so darn flashy...

286
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:25,172
We also suggested to him that he keep a low profile.

287
00:16:25,576 --> 00:16:28,803
But apparently it's for marketing, not just transport.

288
00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:32,379
Aren't you supposed to keep him
under control, Inspector Nakamori?

289
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:36,215
Do you honestly think that old man
would listen to a single word I say?

290
00:16:36,358 --> 00:16:38,067
I guess you have a point there...

291
00:16:39,538 --> 00:16:44,596
So this is the plane they're coming back on?
Is that painting of those sunflowers on it too?

292
00:16:44,674 --> 00:16:48,244
Why does this brat have to
tag along, each and every time?!

293
00:16:48,418 --> 00:16:53,027
We didn't have a choice! Mr. Jirokichi
said he wanted Conan to come along, too.

294
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,877
Hmm.

295
00:16:54,382 --> 00:16:54,870
Huh?

296
00:16:54,933 --> 00:16:57,532
Conan is known as the Kid Catcher after all!

297
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,869
Kid Catcher, huh? What a bunch of nonsense.

298
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:05,462
You're lucky to be here, kid. So don't cause any trouble.

299
00:17:05,518 --> 00:17:06,184
Right!

300
00:17:06,731 --> 00:17:09,315
Ran! Don't let this brat out of your sight.

301
00:17:09,402 --> 00:17:11,689
Well that's what I always intend to do...

302
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,737
Oh... huh?

303
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,130
Who's this? Just a sec.

304
00:17:17,262 --> 00:17:17,617
Uh...

305
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:20,080
Oh, hey there Sonoko!

306
00:17:20,134 --> 00:17:23,012
Yeah! Hey, Ran! I just couldn't wait to tell you.

307
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,030
So we're almost there, and I have some good news.

308
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:31,145
I'm really not supposed to say anything
because he wants to surprise you, but...

309
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,297
Yeah, uh-huh?

310
00:17:33,538 --> 00:17:35,346
What?! Shinichi's with you?

311
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:35,952
Huh?!

312
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:41,109
J-Just because Shinichi's there doesn't mean... well...

313
00:17:41,163 --> 00:17:44,048
Hey, Sonoko! Is Shinichi there with you?

314
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,727
Well, he was sitting right here a minute ago.

315
00:17:55,688 --> 00:17:57,705
Hmm... Hmph.

316
00:18:06,511 --> 00:18:07,551
What the?!

317
00:18:08,247 --> 00:18:09,130
Ah!

318
00:18:10,054 --> 00:18:11,071
Ugh!

319
00:18:14,096 --> 00:18:15,829
Sonoko?! Sonoko, are you okay?!

320
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,182
Hey! Ran, what's going on?

321
00:18:17,238 --> 00:18:20,582
There was a lot of screaming, and then
there was some kind of horrible noise!

322
00:18:20,702 --> 00:18:21,559
What the...

323
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:25,094
Nakamori, come quick! Something's happened on the plane!

324
00:18:25,197 --> 00:18:26,145
Are you sure?

325
00:18:26,221 --> 00:18:26,903
We haven't heard anything on our side.

326
00:18:26,927 --> 00:18:28,518
Don't tell me Kid did that?

327
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:35,589
Ugh... The right wing's aileron
and slats, they aren't responding!

328
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:39,602
Forget it, shut down engine
four! That should put out the fire.

329
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,395
Right!

330
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,059
Is that a...?!

331
00:19:06,535 --> 00:19:11,570
This is the control tower, Flight 2501.
We're clearing runway A for you. Can you make it?

332
00:19:11,921 --> 00:19:13,577
This is flight 2501.

333
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:16,536
We'll try, but better clear all of
the aircraft in the surrounding area!

334
00:19:16,737 --> 00:19:17,324
Copy.

335
00:19:17,554 --> 00:19:20,829
Inform all aircrafts! Check
fuel levels and clear the area!

336
00:19:20,905 --> 00:19:21,464
Huh?

337
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,700
We have to hurry, there's no time!

338
00:19:23,724 --> 00:19:24,061
Right!

339
00:19:24,171 --> 00:19:26,444
Attention all aircrafts! This is an emergency...

340
00:19:26,484 --> 00:19:28,510
Even if they do manage to circle back,

341
00:19:28,677 --> 00:19:30,869
At that altitude they'll overshoot the runway.

342
00:19:31,472 --> 00:19:33,188
They've got to pull this off.

343
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:40,452
Attention all passengers. We
are having some engine trouble.

344
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,784
So we're preparation for an emergency landing.

345
00:19:42,825 --> 00:19:47,034
Please check to see that your seat belts are
securely fastened and all loose items are stored safely.

346
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:58,585
Ugh... Hah!

347
00:19:58,781 --> 00:19:59,782
Aah!

348
00:20:04,196 --> 00:20:05,607
Fifteen thousand feet!

349
00:20:06,394 --> 00:20:07,736
Ten thousand feet!

350
00:20:08,597 --> 00:20:09,562
Okay...

351
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:18,368
Ugh!

352
00:20:18,573 --> 00:20:19,162
Ugh!

353
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,433
Ah! Woah!

354
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:23,832
Ah! Ugh!

355
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,016
Kid's out there!

356
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:40,042
What the?! Kid?! Where is he!
Where's Kid?! Where's that thief!

357
00:20:40,184 --> 00:20:40,907
Where is he?!

358
00:20:40,932 --> 00:20:41,525
Kid's up there?!

359
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,725
So he is there!

360
00:20:42,984 --> 00:20:44,452
Hello? Hello?!

361
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,597
Inspector Nakamori! - Huh?

362
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,837
There seems to be a problem with the plane!

363
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:51,221
They're going to be making an
emergency landing using runway A!

364
00:20:51,288 --> 00:20:52,430
Emergency landing?!

365
00:20:52,476 --> 00:20:54,279
I can't see from here!

366
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:55,521
Kid's behind this?!

367
00:20:55,627 --> 00:20:56,249
Conan?

368
00:20:57,729 --> 00:20:59,738
Hey Sonoko, answer me!

369
00:21:00,061 --> 00:21:01,150
Sonoko!

370
00:21:02,111 --> 00:21:03,620
Uncle Jirokichi!

371
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:05,512
Please Adviser! It's too dangerous!

372
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:10,280
If Kid's here, I need to make sure "Sunflowers" is safe.

373
00:21:10,868 --> 00:21:11,392
Huh?

374
00:21:11,447 --> 00:21:13,675
We will now be making an emergency landing.

375
00:21:13,926 --> 00:21:17,510
As you may know, the explosion has
impaired our control of the craft.

376
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,958
As a result, this will be a very difficult landing.

377
00:21:21,084 --> 00:21:24,398
We're doing all that we can to
ensure that we land the plane safely.

378
00:21:27,043 --> 00:21:28,475
All right, here we go!

379
00:21:32,431 --> 00:21:35,800
Okay, next! Hurry! - Gate #8! Get going!

380
00:21:35,825 --> 00:21:37,134
This is not a drill!

381
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,640
The aircraft just isn't stabilizing!

382
00:21:51,672 --> 00:21:53,333
We can't give up, just keep trying!

383
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:53,944
Right!

384
00:21:56,855 --> 00:21:57,648
Help us!

385
00:21:58,206 --> 00:21:59,005
Ah...

386
00:22:00,254 --> 00:22:01,420
Out of my way!

387
00:22:03,963 --> 00:22:05,090
There it is.

388
00:22:05,207 --> 00:22:06,648
Here it comes!

389
00:22:08,404 --> 00:22:09,548
It's wavering!

390
00:22:09,678 --> 00:22:11,200
They're coming in too high!

391
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:14,392
Oh no, this isn't good.

392
00:22:24,137 --> 00:22:25,883
Damn it! You're gonna listen to me!

393
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,590
Reverse thrust!

394
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:41,658
You sure that's not gonna make us lose control?!

395
00:22:41,688 --> 00:22:43,445
I don't care! We have to stop this plane!

396
00:22:43,485 --> 00:22:43,981
Got it!

397
00:22:44,006 --> 00:22:45,201
Reverse thrust!

398
00:22:57,514 --> 00:22:58,562
What on earth?!

399
00:23:01,025 --> 00:23:04,241
Everyone at the international
terminal, evacuate immediately...

400
00:23:05,252 --> 00:23:07,627
Oh, no! They're gonna crash!

401
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:10,766
Please stop! Come on, come! Stop!!

402
00:23:13,506 --> 00:23:15,254
No! Please, stop!

403
00:23:23,224 --> 00:23:23,690
Ugh...

404
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,003
That was close!

405
00:23:27,138 --> 00:23:29,067
Shinichi, Sonoko!

406
00:23:30,921 --> 00:23:34,002
This is air control. Flight 2501, can you read me?

407
00:23:34,216 --> 00:23:36,305
Flight 2501, please respond.

408
00:23:37,706 --> 00:23:40,192
This is Flight 2501, I apologize.

409
00:23:40,224 --> 00:23:43,029
I ignored your instructions and
changed runways on my own discretion.

410
00:23:43,084 --> 00:23:44,634
Yes sir, but is everything all right?

411
00:23:45,364 --> 00:23:47,255
Yeah, we're good, but barely.

412
00:23:47,783 --> 00:23:51,350
Everyone's safe. Please begin
rescue procedures immediately.

413
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:52,462
Roger.

414
00:23:55,192 --> 00:23:56,729
Hey, brat! You okay?

415
00:23:56,753 --> 00:23:57,416
Mhm...

416
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,374
Look at that! Talk abut a close call, huh?

417
00:24:00,668 --> 00:24:03,185
Yeah. That was too close for comfort...

418
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,840
This could've been a disaster.

419
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,373
Yeah... Would Kid really do something like this?

420
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:11,892
What's that?

421
00:24:13,273 --> 00:24:14,013
Wow!

422
00:24:17,024 --> 00:24:17,930
It's Kid!

423
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,581
Hmph!

424
00:24:21,078 --> 00:24:22,278
No you don't!

425
00:24:23,733 --> 00:24:25,304
Hey! Now where are you going?!

426
00:24:25,329 --> 00:24:27,282
Kid's flying away with the "Sunflowers"!

427
00:24:27,337 --> 00:24:27,644
What?!

428
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:28,512
Wait, really?

429
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:32,796
Shinichi! Sonoko!

430
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:33,883
Huh?

431
00:24:36,862 --> 00:24:39,798
Sonoko! Where are you guys? Are you both okay?!

432
00:24:40,233 --> 00:24:42,736
Calm down, Ran. I'm fine. We're fine!

433
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:47,074
By the way, did Shinichi call
you? Have you heard from him yet?

434
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:49,926
Huh? Shinichi? No, not yet.

435
00:24:51,427 --> 00:24:54,344
Why? Is he okay? I thought you were with him!

436
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:57,257
Actually, I don't see him anywhere.

437
00:24:59,426 --> 00:25:02,030
Hey, kid! That place is off limits!

438
00:25:03,218 --> 00:25:04,878
Damn brat, where'd he go?!

439
00:25:05,401 --> 00:25:07,419
Stop right there! Hey!

440
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,980
Ah, at a time like this?

441
00:25:14,251 --> 00:25:16,827
The person you have dialed is unavailable...

442
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:18,940
Please no, Shinichi...

443
00:25:19,702 --> 00:25:21,592
Please, answer!!

444
00:25:21,957 --> 00:25:24,414
Sorry, Ran. I'm chasing Kid right now!

445
00:25:24,485 --> 00:25:25,932
I'll call you back later!

446
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:36,901
I'm so glad... Shinichi.

447
00:25:42,481 --> 00:25:43,483
Where is he?

448
00:25:43,928 --> 00:25:45,341
Ah... Huh?

449
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,286
You won't get away!

450
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:04,281
Take that!

451
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:08,456
Hmph.

452
00:26:15,953 --> 00:26:17,040
No..!

453
00:26:18,374 --> 00:26:22,748
Ugh... But he wasn't holding the
"Sunflowers" when he jumped from the building...

454
00:26:24,827 --> 00:26:26,919
Judging from the time I lost sight of him...

455
00:26:27,046 --> 00:26:30,016
I'm sure it's hidden somewhere in that building...

456
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:32,859
I knew it!

457
00:26:33,221 --> 00:26:33,517
Hm...

458
00:26:39,421 --> 00:26:43,220
This airport doesn't really have art
supplies. So I hope these will work for you?

459
00:26:43,434 --> 00:26:46,478
It's fine. We're just making
sure there aren't any scratches.

460
00:26:47,986 --> 00:26:49,345
So, are you ready to begin?

461
00:26:49,856 --> 00:26:50,344
Ready.

462
00:26:50,623 --> 00:26:52,690
Hopefully it's just dirty from smoke...

463
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:57,338
One scratch on that painting, and
this exhibition would totally fall apart.

464
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,141
Inspector! Look at this!

465
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:02,247
You were right! The security
camera on the roof did catch Kid.

466
00:27:02,525 --> 00:27:05,623
Looks like he was right above us
about an hour and 15 minutes ago.

467
00:27:06,036 --> 00:27:09,389
And it looks like he was still holding
onto the "Sunflowers" at that point.

468
00:27:09,555 --> 00:27:13,711
Agreed. But why in the world did
Kid abandon the "Sunflowers" outside?

469
00:27:13,814 --> 00:27:16,800
Cause the second "Sunflowers" was larger than he expect.

470
00:27:17,143 --> 00:27:20,900
It created too much wind resistance
while he was flying on his hang glider.

471
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:25,780
Maybe he planned to come back after everything
calmed down, but then the little guy saw him.

472
00:27:25,836 --> 00:27:28,901
Huh? I wasn't the one who found it. It was Shinichi.

473
00:27:28,972 --> 00:27:31,922
He said he saw where Kid hid it
while he was chasing after him.

474
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,055
All right, then.

475
00:27:33,453 --> 00:27:36,292
So, where's that high school detective now?

476
00:27:36,498 --> 00:27:39,501
Urk... He's never around at the same time as Kid.

477
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,535
It's as if he's Kid the Phantom Thief.

478
00:27:41,606 --> 00:27:43,822
Sorry, but I don't think that's possible, sir.

479
00:27:44,433 --> 00:27:49,258
Hey she's right. She got a call from
Shinichi about an hour and 15 minus ago.

480
00:27:49,331 --> 00:27:51,921
That's the same timing as the security footage.

481
00:27:52,013 --> 00:27:55,377
Great. It's like I went to
the states without leaving home.

482
00:27:55,457 --> 00:27:57,330
Forget all that trivial stuff.

483
00:27:57,449 --> 00:28:00,670
The real question here is why did
the kid stick around the airport?

484
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:04,631
Maybe he wanted to see what happened to
the plane he was responsible for blowing up?

485
00:28:04,796 --> 00:28:09,024
Murderers often return to the scene of
the crime, looking like innocent bystanders.

486
00:28:09,056 --> 00:28:09,843
Seriously?

487
00:28:10,203 --> 00:28:11,425
How can you say that?

488
00:28:11,472 --> 00:28:14,221
You can't just go around
treating Kid like he's a murderer!

489
00:28:15,072 --> 00:28:16,128
You need to wake up!

490
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:18,947
He almost killed you too, you know?

491
00:28:20,462 --> 00:28:24,165
I don't want to believe Kid's capable
of causing a plane crash like that.

492
00:28:24,415 --> 00:28:26,749
Of putting innocent folks at risk, you know?

493
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:34,948
Although the painting's been dirtied a bit by the
smog, we're confident there's no need for restoration.

494
00:28:35,042 --> 00:28:39,214
Ah, that's great! We really
dodged a bullet with that one, huh?

495
00:28:39,373 --> 00:28:41,244
You've all done amazing work!

496
00:28:41,506 --> 00:28:42,959
And we're just getting started!

497
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:46,716
Thank goodness it was found before
anything else could happen to it.

498
00:28:46,804 --> 00:28:50,561
You're right. If the painting had been
left out there on the roof of the building,

499
00:28:50,632 --> 00:28:54,405
the heat of the sun and the UV rays
would have caused irreparable damage.

500
00:28:54,588 --> 00:28:56,940
Huh? Job well done, boy!

501
00:28:57,313 --> 00:28:59,769
Just what I'd expect of the Kid Catcher!

502
00:28:59,808 --> 00:29:03,034
But I keep telling you it wasn't me who found it...

503
00:29:04,385 --> 00:29:09,827
Built using Suzuki's great financial
power, I give you the Iron Tanuki Kai!

504
00:29:09,852 --> 00:29:12,361
There's no safer place we could keep it!

505
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,071
Excuse me, but hasn't Kid already
proven he can break into this safe?

506
00:29:16,397 --> 00:29:19,400
Don't you worry. This one's the improved version!

507
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,235
Right, Lupin?

508
00:29:23,689 --> 00:29:26,543
All right. Confirm that everyone's out of the safe!

509
00:29:26,713 --> 00:29:27,215
Right.

510
00:29:31,945 --> 00:29:35,862
Hmph. We're clear. There's not a single soul inside.

511
00:29:36,052 --> 00:29:36,600
Hm.

512
00:29:36,964 --> 00:29:39,795
Iron Tanuki Kai... Let's go!

513
00:29:51,504 --> 00:29:55,801
According to reports from the
Metropolitan Police Department and the MLITT.

514
00:29:55,842 --> 00:30:00,155
Traces of an explosive were found on the
outer wall of the plane's cargo bay door.

515
00:30:00,377 --> 00:30:04,667
Police are searching for a missing
employee who was in charge of the cargo area.

516
00:30:05,318 --> 00:30:08,959
It looks like the owners of the other
"Sunflowers" are getting cold feet.

517
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:14,925
Dad? Isn't there a meeting
you're supposed to be at right now?

518
00:30:14,988 --> 00:30:17,760
Well yeah, but there's a big horse race today.

519
00:30:17,863 --> 00:30:21,407
Seriously? Slacking off because of a horse race?

520
00:30:21,432 --> 00:30:22,416
... to do if you get fired?

521
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:26,230
There's no way they'd fire such a fine detective!

522
00:30:26,309 --> 00:30:28,233
Here. I found these in the mail.

523
00:30:28,336 --> 00:30:29,609
Hm? What's this?

524
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:34,057
Letters, huh? Hey, what if these are fan letters!

525
00:30:35,353 --> 00:30:36,123
Canon?

526
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:39,642
Sonoko invited me to tag along at
their meeting do you want to come with?

527
00:30:39,745 --> 00:30:40,926
Do you wan to come with?

528
00:30:40,992 --> 00:30:43,241
As much as I'd like to go, I can't...

529
00:30:43,266 --> 00:30:46,172
I promised the gang I'd go to
the art museum with them today.

530
00:30:46,197 --> 00:30:48,762
Oh that's nice! That does sound like fun.

531
00:30:49,303 --> 00:30:51,349
Um... By the way...

532
00:30:51,373 --> 00:30:51,686
Huh?

533
00:30:51,979 --> 00:30:55,502
I was wondering, have you heard anything from Shinichi?

534
00:30:55,627 --> 00:30:57,503
Uh-uh. Nothing at all.

535
00:30:58,271 --> 00:31:01,570
He could have at least tole he was going to go to America.

536
00:31:01,848 --> 00:31:04,867
I haven't heard from him since
he went chasing after Kid...

537
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:05,853
Ran...

538
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,344
Conan!

539
00:31:07,424 --> 00:31:09,103
Are you ready yet? Time to go!

540
00:31:09,128 --> 00:31:10,796
Come on, Conan! Let's go!

541
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:11,993
Okay, I'm coming!

542
00:31:12,018 --> 00:31:13,187
Hurry, hurry!

543
00:31:13,274 --> 00:31:15,547
Hey Doc! Conan's on his way!

544
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:18,193
Hey Ai! Looks like he's ready to go!

545
00:31:18,995 --> 00:31:20,345
Guess I'll see you later.

546
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,365
All right, have fun. Tell them I said hi!

547
00:31:24,126 --> 00:31:24,555
Hm.

548
00:31:26,877 --> 00:31:27,388
Ran!

549
00:31:27,436 --> 00:31:28,482
Erk! What?

550
00:31:28,507 --> 00:31:30,424
Contact the police right away!

551
00:31:30,448 --> 00:31:30,912
Huh?

552
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:34,963
It was in one of the envelopes that was in the mail.

553
00:31:35,003 --> 00:31:35,479
Mm!

554
00:31:38,427 --> 00:31:44,092
"Tonight, I come for the left 'La Berceuse'
the first copy will belong to me soon enough."

555
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:48,161
Blast you Kid..! I can't believe you haven't given up yet!

556
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:56,517
the owners of the other "Sunflowers" have expressed their
reluctance to loan their paintings to the exhibition.

557
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:00,117
Therefore, in order to recover
the trust that we have lost,

558
00:32:00,498 --> 00:32:04,447
I'm installing an Anti-Kid security system at Lake Rock.

559
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,790
Based on Natsumi's suggest,

560
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:12,415
we placed camouflaged security cameras
amongst the sunflowers throughout the museum.

561
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:16,673
Please don't hesitate to speak up
if you have any other good ideas.

562
00:32:16,761 --> 00:32:18,691
Of course, money is no object.

563
00:32:18,802 --> 00:32:22,751
Yes. It's our duty to make this
sure this exhibition is a success.

564
00:32:22,893 --> 00:32:25,888
We'll gather our best ideas
and present them to you shortly.

565
00:32:25,968 --> 00:32:27,249
Hm. Very good.

566
00:32:27,533 --> 00:32:30,615
Charlie, I will have your cooperation as well?

567
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:37,521
but he's nothing more than a murderer who
will stop at nothing to achieve his goal.

568
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:38,617
Huh?

569
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,691
Actually, he's a terrorist!

570
00:32:42,042 --> 00:32:44,053
You don't know the first things about Kid!

571
00:32:44,132 --> 00:32:47,586
You have no proof that he's even
remotely responsible for what happened!

572
00:32:47,611 --> 00:32:49,614
Then help me figure this one out.

573
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,126
Who would sabotage the plane?

574
00:32:52,352 --> 00:32:54,659
And what would be their motivation to do so?

575
00:32:55,961 --> 00:32:56,370
Huh?

576
00:32:56,653 --> 00:32:59,560
Uh... Adviser, sir. Something urgent has come up.

577
00:32:59,671 --> 00:33:00,470
What is it?

578
00:33:00,926 --> 00:33:06,003
Inspector Nakamori has called, and if
you don't mind insists on speaking with you.

579
00:33:06,344 --> 00:33:07,650
Fine. Put him through.

580
00:33:07,674 --> 00:33:08,233
Yes, sir.

581
00:33:12,495 --> 00:33:14,576
All right Nakamori, what's going on?

582
00:33:14,723 --> 00:33:15,251
Hm...

583
00:33:17,672 --> 00:33:22,570
The Iron Tanuki's impossible to break
into, but I'll have it investigated at once.

584
00:33:22,641 --> 00:33:24,847
We'll have to save this meeting for later.

585
00:33:24,894 --> 00:33:25,854
What happened, sir?

586
00:33:25,918 --> 00:33:26,656
What's going on?

587
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,243
Do you think Kid's behind this?

588
00:33:28,303 --> 00:33:32,603
Hmm. It seems Detective Mori just received
one of his cards, along with a message.

589
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:36,289
Tsk. So what exactly did the message say?

590
00:33:38,123 --> 00:33:43,248
It says, "Tonight, I come for the left of
'La Berceuse' the first copy will soon be mine."

591
00:33:45,219 --> 00:33:46,228
It can't be...

592
00:33:46,346 --> 00:33:49,154
It's possible he means the left painting in the triptych.

593
00:33:49,241 --> 00:33:50,981
If it's a first copy then...

594
00:33:51,322 --> 00:33:53,593
The rest of you sit tight for a few minutes.

595
00:33:53,726 --> 00:33:54,750
Wait! Adviser!

596
00:33:54,857 --> 00:33:59,289
Kid's message is not talking about the
"Sunflowers" that we have in the safe down stairs.

597
00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:01,047
The left of "La Berceuse".

598
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:04,883
The first copy. He's referring to Van
Gogh's fifth "Sunflowers" not the second.

599
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:05,406
Huh?

600
00:34:05,907 --> 00:34:10,380
And as you're aware, Van Gogh's fifth
"Sunflowers" isn't kept in some far off country.

601
00:34:10,991 --> 00:34:13,502
It's right here in one of our museums.

602
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:17,523
The Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Art Museum, huh?

603
00:34:18,564 --> 00:34:19,605
Art museum?

604
00:34:19,644 --> 00:34:21,169
We're gonna get to see paintings!

605
00:34:21,194 --> 00:34:22,599
It's gonna be fun!

606
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:25,299
Thank you for supporting us with your patronage.

607
00:34:27,151 --> 00:34:29,127
It's my first time in a museum.

608
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:30,519
Really? Me too!

609
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,196
Ah! So high!

610
00:34:33,221 --> 00:34:34,579
What a view, huh?

611
00:34:34,611 --> 00:34:37,049
Look! You can see Bell Tree Tower from here!

612
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:38,512
Wow! That's cool!

613
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,911
Didn't you guys come to see the "Sunflowers"? - Huh?

614
00:34:41,101 --> 00:34:42,595
Oh yeah! That's right!

615
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:45,328
Okay, you guys! Let's go see the "Sunflowers"!

616
00:34:45,353 --> 00:34:47,935
Hey, stop! There's no running in here!

617
00:34:47,998 --> 00:34:51,677
Ah, jeez. Do they actually have
any interest in the "Sunflowers"?

618
00:34:51,702 --> 00:34:54,943
You know, they're not the ones
who were really interested in it.

619
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:55,900
Isn't that right?

620
00:34:56,043 --> 00:34:59,229
That's right! We've got to
see it before everyone else gets

621
00:34:59,253 --> 00:35:02,247
a chance at the "Sunflowers Long for Japan" exhibition.

622
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,700
Sounds like a plan...

623
00:35:03,897 --> 00:35:07,490
But still, I didn't expect that
you'd be tagging along with us.

624
00:35:08,212 --> 00:35:10,279
Weren't you supposed to bet that meeting?

625
00:35:10,335 --> 00:35:13,671
Well six of the samurai are already going to be attend.

626
00:35:14,631 --> 00:35:17,825
It's more important to figure out what Kid's plan is.

627
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:18,659
Huh?

628
00:35:18,796 --> 00:35:23,769
It's just that he's never shown interest in
anything but jewels before. Something's different.

629
00:35:24,238 --> 00:35:28,694
So you decided to come see the target,
Van Gogh's "Sunflowers," for yourself, huh?

630
00:35:28,821 --> 00:35:29,662
That's right.

631
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,897
I wanna learn more about what it is he's after...

632
00:35:33,262 --> 00:35:37,988
I'm hoping to be able to figure out
his motive, and anticipate his next move.

633
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:41,540
Huh? Are we done already?

634
00:35:41,565 --> 00:35:43,065
But which one's the "Sunflowers"?

635
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,329
Look, there it is!

636
00:35:46,154 --> 00:35:48,070
Which one's the "Sunflowers".

637
00:35:48,558 --> 00:35:50,613
It's this one right? The one in the middle?

638
00:35:50,654 --> 00:35:51,122
Woah..!

639
00:35:51,162 --> 00:35:51,917
So pretty!

640
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:53,420
It's incredible...

641
00:35:54,061 --> 00:35:56,804
Hey, what's so great about this painting anyway?

642
00:35:57,591 --> 00:36:00,919
You guys... Keep your voices
down, or they're gonna kick you out.

643
00:36:00,983 --> 00:36:02,227
Okay...

644
00:36:02,254 --> 00:36:04,041
Sorry if they were bothering you.

645
00:36:04,138 --> 00:36:05,225
Not at all.

646
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,985
Ooh! So this right here is Van
Gogh's fifth "Sunflowers" isn't it?

647
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,717
Hey, Doctor! Come on!

648
00:36:11,827 --> 00:36:13,774
Wow it looks truly wonderful!

649
00:36:14,815 --> 00:36:16,842
Huh. Oh, I do apologize!

650
00:36:16,945 --> 00:36:18,089
Oh, it's all right.

651
00:36:18,224 --> 00:36:20,226
All right! We saw the "Sunflowers"!

652
00:36:20,251 --> 00:36:21,440
So that's it then?

653
00:36:21,553 --> 00:36:23,958
Awesome, let's go buy some souvenirs!

654
00:36:23,983 --> 00:36:24,683
Yeah!

655
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,765
Come on, Doc! Let's go!

656
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:28,079
All right.

657
00:36:28,804 --> 00:36:31,785
For crying out loud. Why did they even come here?

658
00:36:34,241 --> 00:36:35,898
Excuse me, young Miss.

659
00:36:35,922 --> 00:36:36,284
Hm?

660
00:36:36,678 --> 00:36:39,988
It's not only the "Sunflowers"
you're interested in, is it?

661
00:36:40,013 --> 00:36:40,651
Huh?

662
00:36:42,175 --> 00:36:43,711
Ah... Mmh.

663
00:36:43,941 --> 00:36:45,736
I'm sorry for bringing it up.

664
00:36:46,022 --> 00:36:49,530
It's just you reminded me of myself when I was your age.

665
00:36:49,554 --> 00:36:50,129
Oh...

666
00:36:52,146 --> 00:36:54,269
Do you visit the museum often, ma'am?

667
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:56,405
Yes, every day.

668
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,032
Huh...

669
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:00,411
You must really love Van Gogh's "Sunflowers" huh?

670
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,610
Ah, I do.

671
00:37:02,419 --> 00:37:04,526
But it's a different one I love...

672
00:37:04,796 --> 00:37:05,298
Ah...

673
00:37:05,574 --> 00:37:06,339
This way!

674
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,668
Well, looks okay to me?

675
00:37:08,946 --> 00:37:10,309
Pops! What's going on?

676
00:37:10,348 --> 00:37:10,821
Aah!

677
00:37:11,154 --> 00:37:13,130
What on earth are you doing here?!

678
00:37:13,157 --> 00:37:13,998
What about you?

679
00:37:14,061 --> 00:37:16,357
Good timing, boy! You should join us.

680
00:37:16,492 --> 00:37:17,300
 How about it?

681
00:37:17,325 --> 00:37:18,613
It's not Kid, is it?

682
00:37:18,716 --> 00:37:20,915
Mhm. His next target's right here.

683
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,808
Adviser Suzuki, would you mind
not discussing that right here?

684
00:37:23,919 --> 00:37:25,095
Yes, of course.

685
00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:29,031
You can see for yourselves that
nothing is out of the ordinary.

686
00:37:29,155 --> 00:37:32,422
Now, our presence here may be
a disturbance to our patrons.

687
00:37:32,461 --> 00:37:35,480
We should continue this discussion in the reception room.

688
00:37:35,662 --> 00:37:38,371
Sounds good to me, let's start making our way back.

689
00:37:38,396 --> 00:37:43,109
Haibara! I'm gonna stay here with Pops and
the others. You head back with everybody else.

690
00:37:43,641 --> 00:37:44,331
Also!

691
00:37:44,411 --> 00:37:47,381
I've got you. The other kids won't know a thing.

692
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:49,056
Great. Thanks a lot.

693
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,441
I see he trusts you, doesn't he?

694
00:37:53,617 --> 00:37:57,066
Hm... Our relationship isn't
exactly what you think it , ma'am.

695
00:37:57,129 --> 00:37:57,901
No!

696
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:02,119
Your gaze is the same as mine was some 70 years ago.

697
00:38:02,722 --> 00:38:06,727
It's just like what the sunflower
says to the sun, in it's own way.

698
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:08,935
"You are the only one I see."

699
00:38:09,143 --> 00:38:13,853
But if all you do is look and take no
action, then that's something you'll regret.

700
00:38:13,971 --> 00:38:15,218
As I now do.

701
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:24,722
You realize how much someone
means to you only after they're gone.

702
00:38:25,515 --> 00:38:27,596
Just like that "Sunflowers."

703
00:38:28,382 --> 00:38:30,314
Hey Ai! It's time to go!

704
00:38:30,491 --> 00:38:30,868
Huh?

705
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:31,959
Where'd Conan go?

706
00:38:32,374 --> 00:38:33,276
He had to go.

707
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,995
Huh?!

708
00:38:34,122 --> 00:38:35,766
Something urgent must have comet up.

709
00:38:35,874 --> 00:38:37,111
Not again?

710
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:38,663
I bet he's just in the restroom!

711
00:38:38,688 --> 00:38:39,936
- Thanks for the advice. - Ah.

712
00:38:40,531 --> 00:38:42,701
I'll try not to have a single regret.

713
00:38:44,435 --> 00:38:47,598
It's too bad you didn't have more
time with the painting, huh, Doctor?

714
00:38:47,756 --> 00:38:51,847
Oh, it's okay! This whetted my
appetite for the "Sunflowers" exhibition!

715
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,033
Oh, Kiyosuke...

716
00:38:55,238 --> 00:38:58,206
What makes you think this
letter that Kid the Phantom Thief

717
00:38:58,231 --> 00:39:01,372
sent you was referring to the "Sunflowers" at this museum?

718
00:39:01,567 --> 00:39:05,581
The title "La Berceuse" translates
to "Woman who rocks the cradle."

719
00:39:05,747 --> 00:39:08,146
It really has nothing to do with "Sunflowers."

720
00:39:08,177 --> 00:39:12,817
The only things that are important is when he's
referring to "the left of" and "his first copy."

721
00:39:12,914 --> 00:39:16,059
"The left" probably refers to that part of the triptych.

722
00:39:16,098 --> 00:39:18,062
Did you just say it's a triptych?

723
00:39:18,134 --> 00:39:21,757
Yeah. When three paintings come together to form one work.

724
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,696
Thanks. We're well aware of that.

725
00:39:23,742 --> 00:39:24,350
Uuh....

726
00:39:24,374 --> 00:39:28,526
But how exactly does that idea
connect, "La Berceuse" to "Sunflowers"?

727
00:39:28,558 --> 00:39:31,132
Well, that... Uh, what was it again?

728
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,016
Get your act together! You're
supposed to be a samurai, remember?

729
00:39:35,286 --> 00:39:40,457
Why don't we have Koji Azuma explain? He's the one
that deciphered the note for us in the first place.

730
00:39:40,482 --> 00:39:43,256
He did figure it all out! Think you can handle it?

731
00:39:43,406 --> 00:39:44,375
Yes, sir!

732
00:39:44,732 --> 00:39:49,572
As Detective Mori was saying, if we assume
the triptych interpretation is correct then,

733
00:39:49,826 --> 00:39:52,527
we can imagine "La Berceuse" at the center of one.

734
00:39:54,386 --> 00:39:56,834
Now which paintings would be on either side?

735
00:39:57,008 --> 00:39:58,463
Well, "Sunflowers."

736
00:39:58,653 --> 00:40:02,166
Right. In a letter Van Gogh
sent to his younger brother Theo,

737
00:40:02,214 --> 00:40:05,488
he even included an illustration,
of the triptych as a whole.

738
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,555
So there can be no doubt as to what Kid meant.

739
00:40:09,666 --> 00:40:12,472
And if we set up the paintings like in the illustration,

740
00:40:13,592 --> 00:40:15,561
the third and seventh are on the right,

741
00:40:16,093 --> 00:40:18,763
and the fourth, fifth, or sixth are on the left.

742
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:24,754
Out of the paintings on the left, the first copy of
"Sunflowers" that Van Gogh painted is the fifth one.

743
00:40:25,127 --> 00:40:27,920
The one which is currently on display in this museum.

744
00:40:29,049 --> 00:40:34,514
Now I get it. Then Kid may have set his sights
on the "Sunflowers" in this museum after all.

745
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:37,581
All right then, what are our
options? What can we do about it?

746
00:40:37,675 --> 00:40:40,219
Kid's letter revealed that he'll be breaking in tonight!

747
00:40:40,338 --> 00:40:43,436
We've got to get the "Sunflowers"
somewhere safe immediately!

748
00:40:43,597 --> 00:40:45,422
Right this minute? Preposterous!

749
00:40:45,457 --> 00:40:46,409
Not to worry.

750
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:50,414
We'll explain the situation to our
patrons and close the museum early.

751
00:40:50,509 --> 00:40:52,621
Thank you so much for your cooperation.

752
00:41:02,289 --> 00:41:05,682
All right, let's go. Slowly, slowly. Good.

753
00:41:05,707 --> 00:41:08,933
I feel rather useless just standing here. Can't we help?

754
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:09,870
 Good question.

755
00:41:10,203 --> 00:41:13,024
Ishimine's Cheetah Transport really is fast.

756
00:41:13,087 --> 00:41:15,152
They did all this in only half an hour.

757
00:41:15,207 --> 00:41:17,282
And we've got an hour before sunset.

758
00:41:17,335 --> 00:41:19,178
Looks like we'll be done just in time.

759
00:41:19,202 --> 00:41:19,841
All right!

760
00:41:19,888 --> 00:41:22,564
There you go. Slowly. Just like that.

761
00:41:22,589 --> 00:41:25,203
Are you sure there isn't any
way we can help you with this?

762
00:41:25,284 --> 00:41:26,197
Uh... Let's see.

763
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:30,433
You can help bring that lid over there?
That way we can quickly wrap this up.

764
00:41:30,512 --> 00:41:33,403
You got it. Hey Natsumi, help me with the lid.

765
00:41:33,546 --> 00:41:34,307
Okay.

766
00:41:36,397 --> 00:41:38,025
Uh... May I give you a hand?

767
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:40,005
Wait. We can handle it.

768
00:41:40,536 --> 00:41:44,310
Mr. Ishimine wouldn't want anyone
who's not on the team handling it.

769
00:41:44,358 --> 00:41:46,535
Good point. We do appreciate the thought.

770
00:41:46,606 --> 00:41:47,718
Ah, of course.

771
00:41:47,789 --> 00:41:49,940
Ready? We'll lift on three.

772
00:41:52,836 --> 00:41:53,842
It's ready to go.

773
00:41:53,866 --> 00:41:54,686
Good work.

774
00:41:54,915 --> 00:41:56,196
We've brought the lid over.

775
00:41:56,221 --> 00:41:58,301
Thanks for the help. We'll take care of it from here.

776
00:41:58,326 --> 00:42:01,409
Don't you think it's about time
we made sure the safe is secure?

777
00:42:01,489 --> 00:42:02,850
I like that idea.

778
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:05,079
Director! Can I have a moment of your time?

779
00:42:05,801 --> 00:42:12,287
Kid left a clue saying he'll show up tonight,
so I'm sure he'll take a shot at that safe.

780
00:42:12,382 --> 00:42:13,890
Ah! Sorry!

781
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:16,569
No problem. Let's keep go.

782
00:42:16,656 --> 00:42:17,300
Yes sir.

783
00:42:18,013 --> 00:42:19,444
Huh? Wait!

784
00:42:19,722 --> 00:42:21,350
I see something under the lid!

785
00:42:21,431 --> 00:42:22,502
Shut up, brat!

786
00:42:22,566 --> 00:42:25,644
We're running behind as it is,
can't you just behave yourself?

787
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,769
But it looks like there's a Kid Card in there!

788
00:42:27,793 --> 00:42:28,637
Huh?

789
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,374
Hold on, lift that lid up.

790
00:42:30,405 --> 00:42:31,204
Yes, sir!

791
00:42:32,156 --> 00:42:32,495
Huh?

792
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:33,666
Uh... Huh?

793
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:37,272
It is a card! Could this be...

794
00:42:37,407 --> 00:42:39,052
Let me see that, Natsumi.

795
00:42:39,258 --> 00:42:39,869
Here.

796
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:43,189
No doubt about it. It's Kid's Card all right.

797
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,948
"I took the 'Sunflowers' off
your hands. Kid the Phantom Thief."

798
00:42:47,044 --> 00:42:48,513
He says that he took it...

799
00:42:48,823 --> 00:42:51,018
But the "Sunflowers" has been here the whole time.

800
00:42:51,081 --> 00:42:51,756
Is that all?

801
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,831
Is anything else written on the card?

802
00:42:53,935 --> 00:42:54,366
Hm.

803
00:42:54,508 --> 00:42:55,699
Wait, what do you mean?

804
00:42:55,783 --> 00:42:58,976
Don't tell me the "Sunflowers"
we have here is already a...

805
00:42:59,238 --> 00:43:00,690
Do you mean it's a fake?!

806
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:04,786
Hmph.

807
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:13,096
I can't believe Kid would lie
about when he was going to appear.

808
00:43:13,167 --> 00:43:16,424
Yeah. The Kid I know would never do anything like that.

809
00:43:16,551 --> 00:43:19,590
They're right, something's definitely wrong here.

810
00:43:19,643 --> 00:43:20,873
He's nothing but a thief.

811
00:43:21,278 --> 00:43:23,750
He'll stop at nothing to get what ever he wants.

812
00:43:23,909 --> 00:43:26,942
Even if that means murdering those that get in his way.
- Huh?

813
00:43:28,874 --> 00:43:30,217
So what's the verdict?

814
00:43:31,772 --> 00:43:34,761
If this is a fake, it's an extremely well made forgery.

815
00:43:35,555 --> 00:43:38,702
It's difficult to accurately appraise it without my gear.

816
00:43:38,856 --> 00:43:40,419
Ah... Yes, I see.

817
00:43:40,568 --> 00:43:44,162
Would it be possible for me to take
the painting with me for a little while?

818
00:43:44,233 --> 00:43:48,261
I would be able to do a more thorough
appraisal back at my company's studio.

819
00:43:48,412 --> 00:43:49,563
Yes, of course.

820
00:43:49,674 --> 00:43:52,542
Since it's possible he switched the real one with a fake,

821
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:55,698
I shouldn't have any trouble
getting approval from my boss.

822
00:43:56,354 --> 00:43:59,129
No need to go through all that trouble, Director.

823
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:00,995
What on earth is the meaning of this?

824
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,656
You can't push us around like that!

825
00:44:03,164 --> 00:44:05,880
Hm? What the... Kid the Phantom Thief!

826
00:44:07,207 --> 00:44:10,154
No way! This appraisal, it was Kid's trap!

827
00:44:10,179 --> 00:44:13,993
Believe me, this "Sunflowers" is the
real deal. You can bet your life on it.

828
00:44:19,045 --> 00:44:21,961
Why you! You trickster, you deceived all of us!

829
00:44:23,779 --> 00:44:25,778
Aah! No!

830
00:44:26,905 --> 00:44:27,444
Huh?

831
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:31,814
Mr. Azuma! Ms. Miyadai!

832
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,149
Stop standing around, he's got the "Sunflowers"!

833
00:44:34,174 --> 00:44:35,586
Somebody catch him!

834
00:44:35,611 --> 00:44:36,203
What?

835
00:44:36,227 --> 00:44:37,269
He took it?!

836
00:44:43,024 --> 00:44:44,717
Come back here, Kid!

837
00:44:46,021 --> 00:44:49,006
This is Nakamori! Kid snatched the "Sunflowers" and fled!

838
00:44:49,054 --> 00:44:52,199
He'll likely show up on the roof! Be on guard! Roger!

839
00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:00,200
Kid spotted! He's on the very top of the roof!

840
00:45:04,009 --> 00:45:04,451
Hmph.

841
00:45:06,436 --> 00:45:07,912
We can't let him get away!

842
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:10,361
Ugh... If only I had my gun.

843
00:45:10,714 --> 00:45:13,715
Kid the Phantom Thief has
launched multiple flying objects!

844
00:45:14,136 --> 00:45:15,273
We've lost sight of him!

845
00:45:15,709 --> 00:45:17,289
Are you kidding?! Find him!

846
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:18,854
Hey, get a load of that!

847
00:45:25,015 --> 00:45:25,670
That one!

848
00:45:27,675 --> 00:45:29,303
Argh... He's getting away!

849
00:45:29,486 --> 00:45:30,160
Where is he? - Huh?

850
00:45:30,962 --> 00:45:32,352
I'm afraid it's too late.

851
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,611
Kid... Is he even human?

852
00:45:36,372 --> 00:45:39,042
He stole it tonight, just like he said he would...

853
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:50,943
This is the card Kid left in my pocket,
when he revealed himself and stole the painting.

854
00:45:51,285 --> 00:45:55,306
"I'll sell you the "Sunflowers" back
for the low, low price of ten billion yen."

855
00:45:55,687 --> 00:45:59,748
"Let's meet in room 1412 of the
Touto Plaza Hotel in two hours."

856
00:46:00,024 --> 00:46:04,483
"Have the cash ready in all old
bills. Lay the bills on top of the bed."

857
00:46:04,729 --> 00:46:08,027
"If you can't do this, then
no deal. Kid the Phantom Thief."

858
00:46:08,207 --> 00:46:10,473
Ten billion yen in two hours!

859
00:46:10,551 --> 00:46:13,985
So Kid was after money this
whole time, not the paintings...

860
00:46:15,017 --> 00:46:18,403
But I just don't understand why he's changed this much?

861
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:20,158
There must be a reason.

862
00:46:20,421 --> 00:46:22,575
Unless, it's not really him?

863
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:27,420
There's no way the museum can prepare
ten billion yen in the space of two hours!

864
00:46:27,526 --> 00:46:33,060
There's only one person in Japan who could come up with
a ridiculous sum like that in such a short amount of time.

865
00:46:33,514 --> 00:46:36,303
Hmm, all right. I guess I could put the money up.

866
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:37,384
You would do that?!

867
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:38,822
On one condition.

868
00:46:39,116 --> 00:46:41,443
As soon as your "Sunflowers" is recovered,

869
00:46:41,531 --> 00:46:44,009
I get to put it on display in my exhibit.

870
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:45,210
Of course.

871
00:46:45,265 --> 00:46:49,230
As long as we could really get it back,
I'm sure my boss would agree to those terms.

872
00:46:49,301 --> 00:46:54,654
Would you be willing to use your position here to convince
the owners of the other five paintings to join us?

873
00:46:54,773 --> 00:46:57,214
Yes, of course. I'll do what ever I can!

874
00:46:57,285 --> 00:46:58,310
Oh, that's great!

875
00:46:58,453 --> 00:47:00,120
All right, we've got a deal.

876
00:47:00,358 --> 00:47:02,116
Let's head to the hotel. On the double.

877
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:02,774
Right.

878
00:47:02,996 --> 00:47:05,667
As soon as you're ready director, meet us over there.

879
00:47:05,866 --> 00:47:06,643
I will!

880
00:47:07,771 --> 00:47:10,294
Will you be going ahead with the police, Charlie?

881
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:12,802
Actually I have something important to get.

882
00:47:12,953 --> 00:47:14,254
Something important?

883
00:47:14,342 --> 00:47:17,553
Yeah. It'll be just the thing to help me take down Kid.

884
00:47:17,799 --> 00:47:21,414
All right. Just make sure you
return in time for the exchange.

885
00:47:21,454 --> 00:47:24,598
You can rest assured. I'll definitely be back in time.

886
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:30,565
Well um, if possible, I may need one more favor from you.

887
00:47:30,692 --> 00:47:33,083
Hm, another? Out with it.

888
00:47:33,299 --> 00:47:37,335
I know someone who would love to be
invited to your Sunflowers exhibition.

889
00:47:37,496 --> 00:47:38,599
Who would that be?

890
00:47:38,725 --> 00:47:44,932
An elderly lady who's been coming to this museum just
about every day since we put "Sunflowers" on display.

891
00:47:45,138 --> 00:47:47,863
Oh, that lady was here today too, wasn't she?

892
00:47:48,046 --> 00:47:49,860
Yes, that's correct.

893
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:54,100
It must mean a lot to her. She
doesn't look at any other paintings.

894
00:47:54,417 --> 00:47:58,792
She just gazes at "Sunflowers" for
hours with a sad look in her eyes.

895
00:47:59,149 --> 00:48:00,262
It's done.

896
00:48:00,951 --> 00:48:02,639
I won't forget this!

897
00:48:07,993 --> 00:48:10,921
It's me. I'm gonna be needing it, after all.

898
00:48:11,586 --> 00:48:12,532
Are you sure?

899
00:48:12,768 --> 00:48:16,234
Even having one in your possession
in this country makes you a criminal.

900
00:48:16,432 --> 00:48:17,210
I know.

901
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:21,206
But I can't let a terrorist
that blew up an airplane get away.

902
00:48:21,309 --> 00:48:24,210
Hmph. Fine, I'll have one ready soon.

903
00:48:24,327 --> 00:48:26,140
Thanks, I appreciate it.

904
00:48:26,651 --> 00:48:29,963
Bring it to the parking lot behind
the Touto Plaza Hotel in an hour.

905
00:48:30,297 --> 00:48:31,305
You got it.

906
00:48:36,169 --> 00:48:38,464
This is the entrance lobby. All clear!

907
00:48:38,931 --> 00:48:41,419
Emergency stairs. Nothing suspicious to report.

908
00:48:42,302 --> 00:48:44,962
There's no way we'll have everything ready at this rate!

909
00:48:45,009 --> 00:48:46,263
Sorry to keep you waiting.

910
00:48:47,297 --> 00:48:49,219
How's the security working, Inspector?

911
00:48:49,244 --> 00:48:51,787
We have police officers covering every exit.

912
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,703
That doesn't do us any good if he's already in the hotel.

913
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:57,452
Even if he is, we'll make sure to catch him this time!

914
00:48:57,539 --> 00:49:00,281
The only way out for him is in handcuffs!

915
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,419
Hurry! There's no time!

916
00:49:02,694 --> 00:49:04,046
Bring it in already!

917
00:49:06,505 --> 00:49:08,406
Put it here, quickly!

918
00:49:15,716 --> 00:49:19,483
So um... Can we even negotiate under these circumstances?

919
00:49:19,508 --> 00:49:22,605
We're just following Kid's
instructions. We have no choice.

920
00:49:22,652 --> 00:49:25,583
Now don't talk to me unless it's absolutely necessary.

921
00:49:25,726 --> 00:49:28,740
If he realizes we're here, the whole deal is kaput.

922
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:29,708
Right....

923
00:49:31,376 --> 00:49:32,727
OK keep going.

924
00:49:32,814 --> 00:49:35,085
Hurry... Quick, hurry! We don't have time!

925
00:49:35,815 --> 00:49:40,695
I don't get it. Is it really necessary
to put all the money on display like that?

926
00:49:40,814 --> 00:49:43,753
What else could we do? Those were Kid's instructions.

927
00:49:43,999 --> 00:49:44,610
W-Woah!

928
00:49:44,668 --> 00:49:46,835
Quiet down! This is serious!

929
00:49:46,961 --> 00:49:47,867
Uh, Haha...

930
00:49:48,243 --> 00:49:49,942
You want to see the monitor, little guy?

931
00:49:50,474 --> 00:49:51,577
Uh, yeah.

932
00:49:54,306 --> 00:49:55,163
Hold on.

933
00:49:55,877 --> 00:49:56,420
Hm.

934
00:49:57,147 --> 00:49:58,070
There you go.

935
00:49:58,102 --> 00:50:00,107
Thanks Mister! That was nice of you!

936
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,488
You need to help us with this...

937
00:50:01,528 --> 00:50:01,877
Huh?

938
00:50:02,059 --> 00:50:05,613
I couldn't help noticing that you're a
pretty sharp and insightful young man.

939
00:50:05,827 --> 00:50:08,664
It's obvious they don't call
you the Kid Catcher for nothing.

940
00:50:08,751 --> 00:50:10,514
Uh... I just got lucky.

941
00:50:10,585 --> 00:50:12,985
I'm still an elementary school student, you know?

942
00:50:13,089 --> 00:50:14,884
That doesn't really matter to me.

943
00:50:15,566 --> 00:50:17,824
Let me know if you find something, okay?

944
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:19,214
Okay.

945
00:50:21,174 --> 00:50:26,285
Thieves usually demand that their money be
deposited directly into an overseas bank account.

946
00:50:26,745 --> 00:50:30,280
The fact that he demanded it
in cash must mean something...

947
00:50:31,099 --> 00:50:31,694
Wh-What? - Huh?

948
00:50:32,115 --> 00:50:34,611
The media's here?! How the heck did that happen?

949
00:50:34,713 --> 00:50:37,885
We're supposed to be the only
ones who know about this deal!

950
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:41,714
I know, but newspapers and TV
stations just keep pouring in!

951
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:45,703
The press are everywhere. It's gonna
get out of control here in the parking lot!

952
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,921
They're already reporting live in front of the hotel!

953
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:53,107
We're at the Touto Plaza Hotel.
According to Kid the Phantom Thief,

954
00:50:53,131 --> 00:50:55,410
a deal between him and Mr. Suzuki
will be taking place here tonight.

955
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:59,720
Kid, he's using the media to turn this
into a circus! It's going to be chaos!

956
00:50:59,994 --> 00:51:00,506
Inspector.

957
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:01,065
Huh?

958
00:51:01,192 --> 00:51:06,630
If Kid's the one who alerted the media, there's no reason
for him to call off the deal just because they showed up.

959
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:09,059
Time's running out, we have to hurry!

960
00:51:09,163 --> 00:51:11,412
Forget about putting the money on the bed!

961
00:51:11,642 --> 00:51:14,034
There's no choice... Our times up.

962
00:51:14,105 --> 00:51:16,178
You can just leave the suitcases open!

963
00:51:16,218 --> 00:51:17,910
Everyone, out of there now!

964
00:51:17,935 --> 00:51:20,776
Hey, don't worry. We'll be right across the hall.

965
00:51:22,001 --> 00:51:24,066
Please, just stay right where you are!

966
00:51:24,091 --> 00:51:25,366
Woah! Ah!

967
00:51:25,398 --> 00:51:26,060
Hurry!

968
00:51:30,152 --> 00:51:33,372
Ugh... Why's this room got to be so hot?

969
00:51:33,459 --> 00:51:35,437
Can I at least open a window?

970
00:51:35,572 --> 00:51:37,090
Please hang in there.

971
00:51:37,193 --> 00:51:39,893
We don't know if Kid's going to come in through the door.

972
00:51:39,981 --> 00:51:41,181
Oh boy...

973
00:51:41,467 --> 00:51:43,072
We pulled out from all areas!

974
00:51:43,249 --> 00:51:44,542
Ok, good work!

975
00:51:44,788 --> 00:51:47,690
All teams, stand by where you
are until further instruction.

976
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:51,342
Knowing Kid, he's got something up his sleeve.

977
00:51:51,413 --> 00:51:54,774
I've got to figure out what he
has planned, before the deal starts.

978
00:51:55,123 --> 00:51:55,639
Huh?!

979
00:51:56,461 --> 00:51:58,685
Hold on, something's change.

980
00:51:58,819 --> 00:52:00,899
It's not the same as it was before.

981
00:52:05,011 --> 00:52:07,009
No way! I have to hurry!

982
00:52:07,073 --> 00:52:07,606
Huh?

983
00:52:08,995 --> 00:52:09,720
Damn!

984
00:52:10,417 --> 00:52:11,002
Huh?

985
00:52:11,203 --> 00:52:12,673
He took the master key!

986
00:52:13,745 --> 00:52:14,285
Hup!

987
00:52:17,338 --> 00:52:19,658
Damn it! I don't have time for this!

988
00:52:19,984 --> 00:52:21,047
Get down here!

989
00:52:21,072 --> 00:52:21,866
Kid Catcher! - Huh?

990
00:52:22,271 --> 00:52:23,544
Hey! What's going on?

991
00:52:24,425 --> 00:52:25,472
Just get in!

992
00:52:27,851 --> 00:52:29,526
Okay, now explain.

993
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:33,633
The water level in the Director's
plastic bottle suddenly went up.

994
00:52:34,054 --> 00:52:37,018
The atmospheric pressure must be rising in there.

995
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:39,360
Why would he cause something like that?

996
00:52:39,385 --> 00:52:40,284
I don't know.

997
00:52:40,332 --> 00:52:45,041
But if we don't get the atmospheric pressure
back to normal fast. Score one for the Kid.

998
00:52:51,436 --> 00:52:54,394
Hey, hey, hey! What are they doing there?!

999
00:52:54,419 --> 00:52:56,600
Are they trying to blow the whole operation?!

1000
00:52:56,951 --> 00:52:59,563
There's only 20 seconds until Kid will be there!

1001
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:04,739
Damn it!

1002
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:07,564
The air pressure's pushing the door shut from inside!

1003
00:53:08,637 --> 00:53:10,720
Those two are gonna ruin everything!

1004
00:53:10,886 --> 00:53:13,540
It's too late, there's less than ten seconds left.

1005
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:14,863
We'll just have to keep going.

1006
00:53:14,887 --> 00:53:15,390
Damn.

1007
00:53:15,724 --> 00:53:17,067
Five seconds left...

1008
00:53:17,092 --> 00:53:21,160
Four, three, two, one, zero!

1009
00:53:23,473 --> 00:53:26,635
Woah! Aah! What's happening?!

1010
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:28,370
What's that?

1011
00:53:28,421 --> 00:53:29,994
Is that Kid? Did Kid appear?

1012
00:53:34,131 --> 00:53:35,448
I'm opening it now..!

1013
00:53:35,472 --> 00:53:36,007
Right!

1014
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:38,675
Aah!

1015
00:53:41,865 --> 00:53:42,325
Hm...

1016
00:53:42,857 --> 00:53:43,322
Hm?

1017
00:53:43,346 --> 00:53:45,668
Aah! Ugh...

1018
00:53:46,963 --> 00:53:47,805
Ah...

1019
00:53:49,862 --> 00:53:51,174
There's Kid!

1020
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,241
Hmph.

1021
00:53:58,205 --> 00:53:58,805
Huh?!

1022
00:53:59,856 --> 00:54:02,368
Kid the Phantom Thief, damn you!

1023
00:54:05,491 --> 00:54:06,303
It's Kid!

1024
00:54:06,707 --> 00:54:09,688
The deal between Kid and the Suzuki Group really happened!

1025
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:10,879
He escaped!

1026
00:54:16,623 --> 00:54:17,766
Are you all right, sir?

1027
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,474
Uh... Yeah...

1028
00:54:19,609 --> 00:54:22,016
Did Kid even bring back the "Sunflowers"?

1029
00:54:22,191 --> 00:54:23,201
I don't know.

1030
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:25,989
Huh?! Hey Charlie, over there!

1031
00:54:26,021 --> 00:54:27,140
Look at that painting!

1032
00:54:29,118 --> 00:54:32,299
How could you?! You morons screwed everything Argh...

1033
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:34,745
Charlie! Where is he? What happened to Kid?

1034
00:54:34,999 --> 00:54:36,096
Well, he got away.

1035
00:54:36,207 --> 00:54:37,834
Then... The "Sunflowers"?

1036
00:54:37,897 --> 00:54:40,599
Don't worry. The "Sunflowers" is safe.

1037
00:54:44,249 --> 00:54:44,971
Ooh!

1038
00:54:44,996 --> 00:54:45,765
Ah!

1039
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:47,496
It's the "Sunflowers"!

1040
00:54:48,106 --> 00:54:49,155
You got it back!

1041
00:54:49,387 --> 00:54:51,437
Yeah, but at what cost...

1042
00:54:51,462 --> 00:54:53,853
Who cares about that? We got it!

1043
00:54:53,892 --> 00:54:56,744
Let's announce this to the press conference!

1044
00:55:00,217 --> 00:55:01,467
Adviser Suzuki!

1045
00:55:01,628 --> 00:55:05,732
Please tell us again about your victorious
showdown against Kid the Phantom Thief!

1046
00:55:05,796 --> 00:55:07,726
You have nothing to fear from Kid!

1047
00:55:07,909 --> 00:55:10,976
The owners of the other "Sunflowers"
don't have to worry either!

1048
00:55:14,806 --> 00:55:18,048
I don't know... It's all too good to be true.

1049
00:55:22,345 --> 00:55:25,778
Everyone's talking about how
"Sunflowers" the international masterpiece,

1050
00:55:25,803 --> 00:55:28,638
has twice been saved by Kid the Phantom Thief's grasp.

1051
00:55:28,771 --> 00:55:29,890
Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki's pet project,

1052
00:55:29,955 --> 00:55:31,005
Hey, look at that.

1053
00:55:31,602 --> 00:55:33,588
I'd really love to see that with you.

1054
00:55:33,754 --> 00:55:35,922
Oh, you mean the sunflowers thing, right?

1055
00:55:36,398 --> 00:55:39,177
The rest of the paintings in
Van Gogh's "Sunflowers" Seriously,

1056
00:55:39,274 --> 00:55:41,675
are being gathered here in Japan, for the exhibit.

1057
00:55:42,421 --> 00:55:46,966
Our special guests today are the people behind
the the aforementioned Sunflowers exhibition.

1058
00:55:47,046 --> 00:55:53,011
Here with us, the Suzuki Group's senior adviser,
Jirokichi Suzuki, and his niece, Sonoko Suzuki.

1059
00:55:53,775 --> 00:55:57,054
Let's see what they have to
say about the upcoming exhibition.

1060
00:55:57,118 --> 00:56:00,258
The exhibition will be held at our Lake Rock Art Museum.

1061
00:56:00,283 --> 00:56:01,966
I don't believe I've heard of that one.

1062
00:56:02,117 --> 00:56:06,939
That's because it's a brand new art museum
constructed specially for this exhibition.

1063
00:56:07,003 --> 00:56:09,004
Oh, that sounds intriguing!

1064
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:14,939
We've reviewed the entire design from top to bottom,
making sure each masterpiece is displayed properly.

1065
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:18,561
With the most robust, impenetrable
security system imaginable.

1066
00:56:18,673 --> 00:56:19,280
Aah.

1067
00:56:19,304 --> 00:56:21,495
Let's take a look at a preview of the museum.

1068
00:56:21,557 --> 00:56:24,489
Ms. Suzuki, would you please describe what we're seeing?

1069
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:30,287
The Lake Rock Art Museum has been established at the
site of a sprawling limestone cave owned by our company.

1070
00:56:30,484 --> 00:56:34,046
The eight story structure has exhibits on every floor.

1071
00:56:34,093 --> 00:56:37,589
Each of the seven "Sunflowers" will
be displayed on a different floor.

1072
00:56:37,636 --> 00:56:40,553
So our guests can take their
time viewing them, one by one.

1073
00:56:40,608 --> 00:56:45,382
And then, as our guests make their way to
the lowest floor, which is deep underground,

1074
00:56:45,407 --> 00:56:48,679
A special elevator will have
moved each of the "Sunflowers",

1075
00:56:48,704 --> 00:56:52,122
from their original location,
to be displayed in an eighth room.

1076
00:57:00,535 --> 00:57:04,101
While waiting for the elevator that
will take them to the roof top exit,

1077
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:08,519
guests will be treated to a view of
all seven "Sunflowers" finally together.

1078
00:57:08,567 --> 00:57:09,544
I get it!

1079
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:12,667
At first, the paintings are
set up to be viewed separately.

1080
00:57:12,873 --> 00:57:18,331
That way the guests can marvel at the intricacies of
each individual painting. Was that what you had in mind?

1081
00:57:18,386 --> 00:57:21,224
Of course! But also, it's perfectly secure.

1082
00:57:21,327 --> 00:57:24,365
If the various sensors notice even the slightest change,

1083
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:28,010
the paintings are immediately
sealed in fire and waterproof cases.

1084
00:57:28,502 --> 00:57:31,877
So there's no danger of them
being harmed by flames or flooding.

1085
00:57:32,202 --> 00:57:34,762
And even if someone did try to steal a painting,

1086
00:57:34,802 --> 00:57:38,552
the security system would activate, closing off all exits.

1087
00:57:38,837 --> 00:57:42,944
So let's say Kid the Phantom Thief
disguised himself to blend in with the crowd,

1088
00:57:43,032 --> 00:57:44,781
he'd never be able to get away.

1089
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:47,379
Our safety measures are flawless as well.

1090
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:51,310
The security system will never shut
down the elevator that goes to the exit,

1091
00:57:51,366 --> 00:57:53,530
and will always provide lighting for safety.

1092
00:57:53,854 --> 00:57:56,349
I understand, it can produce its own power?

1093
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:57,405
That is right!

1094
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:00,544
And we have some footage of that
as well. How about we take a look?

1095
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:06,080
Water's sucked from the lake that's in front of
the museum into the tanks on the top most floor.

1096
00:58:06,277 --> 00:58:10,712
This allows us to generate hydraulic
power by using the difference in elevation.

1097
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,137
That way we can direct our guests to the roof top exit.

1098
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,849
While the "Sunflowers" take a special
route that delivers them to a storehouse.

1099
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,490
Which will provide emergency escape access.

1100
00:58:21,891 --> 00:58:24,139
Wow, you have thought of everything!

1101
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:27,549
You've made quite the impregnable
fortress for the "Sunflowers"!

1102
00:58:27,574 --> 00:58:28,287
That's right!

1103
00:58:28,509 --> 00:58:31,426
At the same time, people can see our great treasures,

1104
00:58:31,451 --> 00:58:34,635
the seven "Sunflowers" in this fantastic environment!

1105
00:58:34,992 --> 00:58:38,034
At the "Sunflowers Long for Japan" Exhibit!

1106
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:46,273
The "Sunflowers Long for Japan" Exhibition will be open
to the public for one month, with only 100 guests per day.

1107
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:49,363
So when will you be opening the
raffle for tickets to the event?

1108
00:58:49,388 --> 00:58:50,674
Right this very moment!

1109
00:58:50,699 --> 00:58:51,645
Seriously?

1110
00:58:51,709 --> 00:58:55,340
Just head on over to our website
and you can register right now!

1111
00:58:55,403 --> 00:58:59,341
There'll be a lot of competition for
tickets cause the raffle is open world wide.

1112
00:58:59,778 --> 00:59:02,965
Okay! Don't let this opportunity pass you up!

1113
00:59:04,133 --> 00:59:05,963
Aw, I didn't get it!

1114
00:59:06,633 --> 00:59:09,804
I thought for sure we'd win
by using Doc's internet, but...

1115
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:12,013
What the heck? None of us got a ticket!

1116
00:59:12,038 --> 00:59:15,374
Doc, what happens when you win?
Anything cool? We just keep losing...

1117
00:59:15,399 --> 00:59:17,750
First it'll take a photo for facial recognition purposes,

1118
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:21,698
then it will display your registration
ID, and give you a unique PIN.

1119
00:59:22,065 --> 00:59:25,027
Then you'll enter that info into the application screen,

1120
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:26,832
and get your tickets a few days later.

1121
00:59:26,912 --> 00:59:28,937
Doctor, how do you know that?

1122
00:59:29,469 --> 00:59:30,668
Wait! You mean...

1123
00:59:30,923 --> 00:59:34,752
That's right. I'm a lucky winner! Hehehehahaha!

1124
00:59:34,777 --> 00:59:36,092
That's a really creepy laugh.

1125
00:59:36,116 --> 00:59:36,683
Huh?!

1126
00:59:37,969 --> 00:59:41,967
You actually got one?! Please
let me have it, I really wanna go!

1127
00:59:42,006 --> 00:59:42,806
Me, too!

1128
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:43,572
Me, three!

1129
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,457
That ticket's mine alone!

1130
00:59:46,545 --> 00:59:48,180
How immature of you, Doctor. - Oh?

1131
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:49,842
Yeah Doc, immature!

1132
00:59:49,874 --> 00:59:50,666
Childish even!

1133
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:52,090
Yeah, childish!

1134
00:59:52,129 --> 00:59:53,369
Well, I don't know...

1135
00:59:54,815 --> 00:59:57,013
Let's use a quiz to decide who gets it!

1136
00:59:57,037 --> 00:59:57,604
Huh?!

1137
00:59:58,003 --> 01:00:02,315
It's multiple choice, so you get only
one chance to answer as a group. Okay?

1138
01:00:02,458 --> 01:00:02,893
Yeah!

1139
01:00:02,917 --> 01:00:03,507
I'm in!

1140
01:00:03,532 --> 01:00:04,851
This is gonna be fun!

1141
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:07,114
Then it's a showdown!

1142
01:00:07,574 --> 01:00:12,675
So, what does a sun-loving sunflower, in a
field of sunflowers, hate more than anything?

1143
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,748
Is it one? Spiders.

1144
01:00:14,899 --> 01:00:16,678
Or two, is it snakes?

1145
01:00:16,869 --> 01:00:19,007
Or, three? Scorpions!

1146
01:00:19,133 --> 01:00:21,899
So it's spiders, snakes, or scorpions, huh?

1147
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,780
Yeah. So then the answer is...

1148
01:00:23,804 --> 01:00:24,339
Shh!

1149
01:00:24,536 --> 01:00:26,007
You two don't get to answer!

1150
01:00:26,238 --> 01:00:27,153
I've got it!

1151
01:00:27,177 --> 01:00:28,137
I know, I know!

1152
01:00:28,197 --> 01:00:28,812
Me, too!

1153
01:00:28,962 --> 01:00:31,105
The answer is number three, scorpions!

1154
01:00:31,139 --> 01:00:31,842
Huh?

1155
01:00:31,866 --> 01:00:33,299
That's wrong, Genta!

1156
01:00:33,331 --> 01:00:36,425
Huh? But scorpions are poisonous.

1157
01:00:36,469 --> 01:00:38,612
Spiders and snakes can be poisonous too!

1158
01:00:38,637 --> 01:00:39,640
Are you serious?!

1159
01:00:40,172 --> 01:00:41,498
The correct answer...

1160
01:00:41,546 --> 01:00:43,533
Would be number one, spiders!

1161
01:00:43,558 --> 01:00:46,776
Spider in Japanese is "kumo".

1162
01:00:47,325 --> 01:00:50,484
Ugh, "kumo" also means cloud in Japanese!

1163
01:00:50,547 --> 01:00:55,902
The sunflower loves the sun, so it hates anything
that would block it like clouds! That's why it's spiders!

1164
01:00:55,981 --> 01:00:58,855
What the heck? So poison doesn't matter at all.

1165
01:00:59,207 --> 01:01:04,092
And so, I'm not giving my ticket
to anyone. You all failed the quiz!

1166
01:01:05,626 --> 01:01:09,830
And so we all want to see the Sunflowers exhibition.

1167
01:01:10,093 --> 01:01:11,371
Is there any way..?

1168
01:01:11,396 --> 01:01:12,984
We really wanna see it!

1169
01:01:13,009 --> 01:01:13,824
Pretty please?

1170
01:01:13,848 --> 01:01:15,067
We'll do anything!

1171
01:01:15,226 --> 01:01:15,837
Hmm...

1172
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:17,754
All right then.

1173
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:18,337
Huh?

1174
01:01:18,417 --> 01:01:19,545
Oh yeah!

1175
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:20,710
Are you serious?!

1176
01:01:20,766 --> 01:01:21,465
However...

1177
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:25,397
I will need you to help me out, more than ever before!

1178
01:01:25,489 --> 01:01:27,680
It's on you Mr. Kid Catcher.

1179
01:01:28,303 --> 01:01:29,587
Adviser Suzuki.

1180
01:01:29,611 --> 01:01:30,043
Hm?

1181
01:01:30,074 --> 01:01:32,084
We really need to get back to that meeting.

1182
01:01:32,252 --> 01:01:33,769
Um... Yes, that's right.

1183
01:01:33,886 --> 01:01:36,471
Okay everybody, I'll give you all a ride back home.

1184
01:01:36,519 --> 01:01:37,662
 Okay!

1185
01:01:37,876 --> 01:01:41,499
Don't forget to save a couple extra
tickets for Ran and Shinichi, uncle.

1186
01:01:41,563 --> 01:01:42,945
Right. Ishimine.

1187
01:01:43,569 --> 01:01:45,195
Please go on ahead without me.

1188
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:48,928
Yes, sir. Let me know when you've chosen
the time and the route for each vehicle.

1189
01:01:49,934 --> 01:01:52,708
Wait, then how are you going to get them to the museum?

1190
01:01:52,819 --> 01:01:57,476
Even if Lake Rock's security is perfect,
transporting them is the most dangerous part.

1191
01:01:57,531 --> 01:02:01,496
You don't have to worry. We've got a
lot of dummy transport vehicles prepared.

1192
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:04,538
And I'm the only one who knows which vehicles have them.

1193
01:02:04,624 --> 01:02:07,374
Ah, great. Then it's definitely in good hands.

1194
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:10,972
But if you're gonna use that thing, remember this...

1195
01:02:11,822 --> 01:02:16,638
No matter how just you think you
might be, no life should be cut short.

1196
01:02:17,047 --> 01:02:18,165
That's very true.

1197
01:02:18,378 --> 01:02:22,489
But lofty ideals like that will
eventually come back to bite you in the end.

1198
01:02:22,763 --> 01:02:25,522
The same way that Kid the Phantom Thief has.

1199
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:28,650
Conan, what are you doing? We're leaving!

1200
01:02:28,852 --> 01:02:30,889
Everyone else is already in the car!

1201
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:31,512
Coming!

1202
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:32,234
Hm...

1203
01:02:32,608 --> 01:02:33,401
Blegh!

1204
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:38,026
She sure doesn't like me, huh?

1205
01:02:38,509 --> 01:02:39,471
E-Excuse me.

1206
01:02:40,926 --> 01:02:44,304
We've just received a package
with a letter addressed to you, sir.

1207
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:45,740
Ah, thank you.

1208
01:02:45,898 --> 01:02:49,398
Let's see, now why was it sent here, not the company?

1209
01:02:53,283 --> 01:02:55,189
Will you keep it down, Lupin!

1210
01:02:56,721 --> 01:02:58,469
Always wanting attention!

1211
01:02:58,548 --> 01:03:00,979
Huh?! H-How can it be?

1212
01:03:01,138 --> 01:03:02,203
From Kid?!

1213
01:03:03,705 --> 01:03:04,729
Please show me.

1214
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:08,701
There's no mistake, it is a Kid card. But what's that?

1215
01:03:08,772 --> 01:03:10,667
Well it's wrapped like a present, but...

1216
01:03:15,449 --> 01:03:16,631
What is it, Lupin?

1217
01:03:16,774 --> 01:03:18,096
Sir! Stay behind me.

1218
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:21,217
Get away from there Lupin, now!

1219
01:03:21,393 --> 01:03:22,060
What the...

1220
01:03:22,207 --> 01:03:25,363
This stench and ignition speed... Phosphine?

1221
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,588
It's extremely volatile! Everyone, get out of here!

1222
01:03:36,119 --> 01:03:37,406
You all right, Charlie?!

1223
01:03:37,541 --> 01:03:39,241
Yeah, it's safe now.

1224
01:03:39,376 --> 01:03:41,787
Get Inspector Nakamori on the phone, now!

1225
01:03:41,827 --> 01:03:42,415
Yes, sir!

1226
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:46,608
Not a good idea sir. This was
designed to do more than just kill you.

1227
01:03:46,743 --> 01:03:49,669
Huh? Contacting the police could delay the exhibit.

1228
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:52,589
Worst-case scenario, it could even be canceled.

1229
01:03:54,306 --> 01:03:57,461
He is right. Charlie brings up a really good point.

1230
01:03:57,948 --> 01:03:58,844
Understood.

1231
01:03:59,066 --> 01:04:02,880
This goes for all of you. Not a
word of this to anybody, got it?

1232
01:04:03,904 --> 01:04:05,334
Yes sir, understood.

1233
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:08,935
Ooh, good job using your nose, Lupin.

1234
01:04:10,109 --> 01:04:13,214
Charlie, we should seal this room. Just in case.

1235
01:04:13,253 --> 01:04:13,729
Yeah.

1236
01:04:16,656 --> 01:04:17,402
Hmm...

1237
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:21,995
Kid the Phantom Thief. You've revealed your true colors.

1238
01:04:22,248 --> 01:04:24,449
You won't get any mercy from me.

1239
01:04:35,787 --> 01:04:37,320
All right! All right!

1240
01:04:37,693 --> 01:04:42,413
Just how many dummy trucks did Suzuki hire, exactly?

1241
01:04:42,469 --> 01:04:45,275
About what happened earlier. Your thoughts?

1242
01:04:45,417 --> 01:04:46,280
My thoughts?

1243
01:04:46,394 --> 01:04:47,538
What's his motive?

1244
01:04:48,012 --> 01:04:51,177
If for any reason they decide to cancel the exhibition...

1245
01:04:51,391 --> 01:04:55,729
The second and fifth "Sunflowers" will
be released from Lake Rock Art Museum.

1246
01:04:56,165 --> 01:04:58,517
Giving Kid another chance to steal them.

1247
01:04:58,612 --> 01:05:03,687
If that's true, then he could just
take them when the exhibit's over.

1248
01:05:04,211 --> 01:05:07,103
Why would Kid the Phantom Thief be in such a hurry?

1249
01:05:38,584 --> 01:05:39,071
Hmm...

1250
01:06:03,829 --> 01:06:09,812
Welcome everyone, to the grand opening of our "Japan
Longs for Sunflowers" Exhibition. Thank you for coming!

1251
01:06:10,233 --> 01:06:12,831
Let me introduce the man behind the exhibition!

1252
01:06:12,997 --> 01:06:16,804
Let's all welcome, Mr. Jirokichi Suzuki!

1253
01:06:18,790 --> 01:06:22,955
Well, we're here because we're captivated by "Sunflowers!

1254
01:06:23,113 --> 01:06:24,677
Are you excited?

1255
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:34,243
Excellent! Then the "Japan Longs for Sunflowers" is open!

1256
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:39,487
We will now begin to admit our guests.

1257
01:06:39,551 --> 01:06:42,381
Please wait your place in line, with tickets ready.

1258
01:06:42,429 --> 01:06:44,325
Excuse me. I'm Ran Mori.

1259
01:06:44,436 --> 01:06:46,726
Okay, I'll just need to see your tickets.

1260
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:48,172
There are six of us.

1261
01:06:48,401 --> 01:06:50,204
Looks like you're all good to go.

1262
01:06:50,316 --> 01:06:51,470
Please enter this way.

1263
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:53,096
We get to go in it first!

1264
01:06:53,121 --> 01:06:53,740
Awesome!

1265
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,523
Hurry up, Ran! Come on, let's go!

1266
01:06:56,573 --> 01:06:58,066
You're all here together,right?

1267
01:06:58,099 --> 01:06:58,559
Yup!

1268
01:06:59,164 --> 01:07:01,848
Please insert all your tickets right here into the gate.

1269
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:03,007
Sure!

1270
01:07:03,175 --> 01:07:05,127
... your ticket ready as you move forward!

1271
01:07:07,401 --> 01:07:09,885
Everything going smoothly with the admissions?

1272
01:07:10,357 --> 01:07:11,056
Yes, sir.

1273
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:15,083
And the display and security systems
are also in perfect working order.

1274
01:07:15,202 --> 01:07:19,167
Mm. I want everyone besides Goto to return to their posts.

1275
01:07:19,247 --> 01:07:19,723
Right!

1276
01:07:20,883 --> 01:07:24,125
Uh, wait! Can he operate all this by himself?

1277
01:07:24,276 --> 01:07:27,191
Stop worrying! Everything here is automated.

1278
01:07:27,382 --> 01:07:32,555
Besides, very few people know where this
room is. Let alone, have any access to it.

1279
01:07:32,729 --> 01:07:35,343
Well, I guess that's true.

1280
01:07:35,549 --> 01:07:35,898
Gah!

1281
01:07:36,073 --> 01:07:37,194
Now what's wrong?

1282
01:07:37,505 --> 01:07:38,609
N-Nothing...

1283
01:07:38,672 --> 01:07:40,618
You don't know how to calm down, do you?

1284
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:44,376
That teen detective's ate exhibit, too?

1285
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:48,421
Goto, do you notice anyone acting suspiciously?

1286
01:07:48,952 --> 01:07:53,980
Just a minute ago, the initial group took the
elevator, to the first "Sunflowers" exhibit room.

1287
01:07:54,298 --> 01:07:57,539
But one of them went straight
for the second "Sunflowers" exhibit.

1288
01:07:57,690 --> 01:07:59,031
I'll bring up the image.

1289
01:08:01,067 --> 01:08:03,690
It's weird that they went straight to the second painting.

1290
01:08:03,771 --> 01:08:05,585
Let's zoom in a bit on that one.

1291
01:08:07,573 --> 01:08:07,962
Goto?

1292
01:08:07,987 --> 01:08:09,300
Huh..? Right!

1293
01:08:11,363 --> 01:08:13,564
What the... Is she crying?

1294
01:08:13,643 --> 01:08:16,440
I guess she really wanted to see the second "Sunflowers."

1295
01:08:16,613 --> 01:08:19,403
Don't worry sir. She won't be causing any trouble.

1296
01:08:19,767 --> 01:08:21,500
Let's focus on fig Kid.

1297
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:24,289
Right, right. Of course, let's go back.

1298
01:08:24,837 --> 01:08:25,559
Yes, sir.

1299
01:08:34,229 --> 01:08:35,850
They're beautiful!

1300
01:08:35,977 --> 01:08:38,756
Uuh, but I don't think these are real, Ayumi?

1301
01:08:38,807 --> 01:08:40,848
If they were real flowers, they'd wilt.

1302
01:08:41,118 --> 01:08:45,664
Well I don't care if they're fake, but they
could at least make them smell better than this.

1303
01:08:45,753 --> 01:08:46,960
It's that kinda weird.

1304
01:08:47,118 --> 01:08:51,138
These were Natsumi's idea, but she never
mentioned she'd be giving them a scent?

1305
01:08:51,709 --> 01:08:56,560
But never mind that! I wanna go see the second
"Sunflowers"! We should go check that out next.

1306
01:08:56,934 --> 01:08:57,728
Great idea!

1307
01:08:57,753 --> 01:08:58,575
Let's go!

1308
01:08:58,599 --> 01:08:59,239
Yeah!

1309
01:09:02,233 --> 01:09:02,701
Huh?

1310
01:09:03,546 --> 01:09:05,014
Security cameras?

1311
01:09:05,427 --> 01:09:07,437
They've got them all over the place!

1312
01:09:08,025 --> 01:09:10,203
Conan? Come on, we need to go!

1313
01:09:10,557 --> 01:09:11,346
Coming!

1314
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,359
Look, there it is!

1315
01:09:20,532 --> 01:09:21,260
No way!

1316
01:09:21,284 --> 01:09:22,295
Awesome!

1317
01:09:22,446 --> 01:09:24,646
I can't believe we're finally seeing it!

1318
01:09:26,849 --> 01:09:27,340
Huh..?

1319
01:09:28,858 --> 01:09:29,630
Ran!

1320
01:09:29,898 --> 01:09:30,235
Huh?

1321
01:09:30,259 --> 01:09:31,425
I just saw Shinichi!

1322
01:09:32,417 --> 01:09:33,139
No way!

1323
01:09:34,573 --> 01:09:35,570
Shinichi..!

1324
01:09:36,937 --> 01:09:38,360
Sonoko, is he here?

1325
01:09:38,915 --> 01:09:40,552
Sorry. I lost sight of him.

1326
01:09:40,577 --> 01:09:42,054
You sure he was really here?

1327
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,228
Now that you mention it...

1328
01:09:44,652 --> 01:09:47,520
I'm not sure. It must have been someone else.

1329
01:09:47,567 --> 01:09:49,331
I hope so, but...

1330
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:52,263
Considering the high security at this place...

1331
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:56,593
It'd be impossible to enter in disguise
because of all the bag checks and x-rays.

1332
01:09:57,913 --> 01:10:00,375
Meaning the only way Kid could enter...

1333
01:10:01,194 --> 01:10:05,107
Would be by impersonating me, since
our features happen to be similar.

1334
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:07,755
Hmph.

1335
01:10:11,024 --> 01:10:11,491
Huh?

1336
01:10:14,749 --> 01:10:17,154
Hm... What is this?

1337
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:20,173
A Kid card!

1338
01:10:20,227 --> 01:10:22,039
So he is impersonating me!

1339
01:10:22,257 --> 01:10:23,110
Are you okay?

1340
01:10:23,134 --> 01:10:23,543
Huh?

1341
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:25,489
I couldn't find him anywhere.

1342
01:10:25,592 --> 01:10:28,452
Sorry. I guess it was somebody else, huh?

1343
01:10:28,777 --> 01:10:30,200
Hey, Ran! Sonoko!

1344
01:10:30,225 --> 01:10:31,518
Lower your voice, Conan!

1345
01:10:31,543 --> 01:10:32,906
I need to see security!

1346
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:33,314
Huh?

1347
01:10:34,275 --> 01:10:37,104
Look, a Kid card! He's already here in Lake Rock!

1348
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:38,881
Kid the Phantom Thief!

1349
01:10:40,004 --> 01:10:41,673
What does all this even mean?

1350
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:44,500
If we assume it's about the "Sunflowers"...

1351
01:10:44,644 --> 01:10:48,440
Van Gogh painted 15 sunflowers
in a couple of those paintings.

1352
01:10:48,658 --> 01:10:52,511
The fourth, the fifth, and the sixth
paintings all have 15 sunflowers in them?

1353
01:10:52,733 --> 01:10:55,379
So is there a painting with just 14?

1354
01:10:55,625 --> 01:10:57,214
There's none that I can think of.

1355
01:10:57,262 --> 01:10:57,660
No!

1356
01:10:57,754 --> 01:11:02,682
See, there's a theory that for Van Gogh
the numbers 14 and 15 have the same meaning.

1357
01:11:02,792 --> 01:11:08,313
In a letter to his brother Theo, Van Gogh wrote that
one if his paintings with 15 flowers actually had 14.

1358
01:11:08,853 --> 01:11:13,541
So if that's the number of sunflowers, what's
the meaning behind all those numbers after it?

1359
01:11:13,716 --> 01:11:15,059
Just doesn't make sense.

1360
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:18,603
Scholars are confident that there was
more to his paintings than met the eye.

1361
01:11:18,952 --> 01:11:21,081
Including the 14 sunflowers.

1362
01:11:21,207 --> 01:11:24,632
Which are said to represent,
Theo, Gauguin, and the 12 apostles.

1363
01:11:24,657 --> 01:11:26,475
Yeah! I bet that's exactly it!

1364
01:11:26,578 --> 01:11:27,755
How do you figure that?

1365
01:11:27,794 --> 01:11:30,019
Let's take another look at Kid's card.

1366
01:11:30,527 --> 01:11:34,674
Eleven people plus 1 person equals Christ's 12 apostles.

1367
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:38,289
Plus two more, they're often
thought to be Theo and Gauguin.

1368
01:11:38,805 --> 01:11:41,006
That makes 14 people all together.

1369
01:11:41,141 --> 01:11:44,144
And when he said there were actually 15 sunflowers,

1370
01:11:44,263 --> 01:11:47,837
the idea is that Van Gogh was
including himself as the extra person.

1371
01:11:48,282 --> 01:11:50,405
That interpretation's a possibility,

1372
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:53,789
but how exactly does this theory
of yours tie into the equation?

1373
01:11:53,947 --> 01:11:57,547
Why did Kid have to make it so
complicated? This is gonna take us all night!

1374
01:11:57,602 --> 01:12:01,850
I have no idea, but how do we even
know that Kid intended it to be a clue?

1375
01:12:02,211 --> 01:12:02,623
Hmm...

1376
01:12:03,933 --> 01:12:05,197
Clue or not.

1377
01:12:05,396 --> 01:12:07,644
What's the point of this Kid card anyway?

1378
01:12:07,858 --> 01:12:11,800
Let's worry about catching him first
so we can ask about it face-to-face!

1379
01:12:11,982 --> 01:12:14,978
With your help, we can lock
Kid up. Right here in Lake Rock!

1380
01:12:15,234 --> 01:12:16,337
Ah... Ok!

1381
01:12:16,408 --> 01:12:19,813
Goto? Let's evacuate all guests and employees at once.

1382
01:12:19,837 --> 01:12:20,158
Right.

1383
01:12:20,629 --> 01:12:24,822
But sir! You're closing the exhibit
when it's been open for less than an hour?

1384
01:12:24,979 --> 01:12:27,412
If you do this, you'll have a riot on your hands.

1385
01:12:27,437 --> 01:12:28,474
Don't you worry.

1386
01:12:28,498 --> 01:12:28,810
Hm?

1387
01:12:28,977 --> 01:12:31,426
Anything can happen during a grand opening.

1388
01:12:31,576 --> 01:12:35,420
That's why we only invited company
connections and Sonoko's friends.

1389
01:12:35,445 --> 01:12:36,112
Adviser.

1390
01:12:36,231 --> 01:12:36,548
Huh?

1391
01:12:36,619 --> 01:12:39,249
We'll take charge of security, just as you planned.

1392
01:12:39,376 --> 01:12:43,157
Mm. I'm counting on all of you, you're my Seven Samurai.

1393
01:12:43,332 --> 01:12:46,535
I see. Looks like you were
ready for an emergency after all.

1394
01:12:46,844 --> 01:12:52,105
All right. Let's follow through with the plan and stay
in contact with each other in case we leave our posts.

1395
01:12:52,850 --> 01:12:53,819
Understood.

1396
01:12:55,821 --> 01:12:58,613
All right everyone, there's an issue with the display.

1397
01:12:58,748 --> 01:13:02,521
Please proceed to the elevators, we
do apologize for any inconvenience.

1398
01:13:02,572 --> 01:13:04,277
I bet Kid's here somewhere.

1399
01:13:04,302 --> 01:13:06,088
Then this is a job for the Detective Boys!

1400
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:06,944
No, it isn't.

1401
01:13:07,016 --> 01:13:07,493
Huh?

1402
01:13:07,701 --> 01:13:09,466
This time, Kid's dangerous.

1403
01:13:09,665 --> 01:13:11,730
Don't you dare leave my side, got it?

1404
01:13:11,841 --> 01:13:12,841
Fine!

1405
01:13:13,365 --> 01:13:16,201
All right then, how's the guest evacuation coming along?

1406
01:13:16,257 --> 01:13:17,178
Smoothly, sir.

1407
01:13:17,574 --> 01:13:20,563
It's just taking longer than
we expected due to the x-rays.

1408
01:13:20,832 --> 01:13:23,076
Then eliminate the X-ray inspection.

1409
01:13:23,227 --> 01:13:26,340
Allow each guest to exit after returning their bags.

1410
01:13:26,365 --> 01:13:29,312
You're willing to let Kid escape that easily? Seriously?!

1411
01:13:29,386 --> 01:13:30,576
Oh, calm down.

1412
01:13:30,671 --> 01:13:33,910
He isn't the kind of thief who'd
escape when the prize was in front of him.

1413
01:13:34,127 --> 01:13:35,740
You know that as well as I do.

1414
01:13:36,088 --> 01:13:38,830
Well, I guess he wouldn't leave the building so quickly.

1415
01:13:38,933 --> 01:13:43,844
Exactly. So we'll seal up all the
escape routes. That way he can't get away.

1416
01:13:43,987 --> 01:13:47,526
The only way he could've gotten
in here is if he wasn't in disguise,

1417
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:50,740
and that means he wouldn't have his usual bag of tricks.

1418
01:13:50,858 --> 01:13:53,756
We have Kid the Phantom Thief right where we want him!

1419
01:13:53,843 --> 01:13:54,346
Hm.

1420
01:13:54,371 --> 01:13:59,217
Besides that, I've got my 12 trustworthy associates
watching out for him throughout the building.

1421
01:14:00,225 --> 01:14:02,457
Twelve trustworthy people.

1422
01:14:02,806 --> 01:14:08,891
I see. He didn't write the "12 apostles"
as "12 people," but as "11 people plus 1."

1423
01:14:09,128 --> 01:14:10,448
And that must mean...

1424
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:12,554
Mr. Jirokichi!

1425
01:14:12,625 --> 01:14:13,018
Hm?

1426
01:14:13,042 --> 01:14:14,882
- You have 12 trustworthy people,

1427
01:14:15,016 --> 01:14:19,045
that's the same number as Christ's
apostles referenced on Kid's card, right?

1428
01:14:19,245 --> 01:14:23,497
I couldn't stop wondering why Kid
didn't just write "12 people" instead.

1429
01:14:23,685 --> 01:14:26,244
Maybe there was one person who was left out?

1430
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:29,303
Oh... What about, uh... Judas!

1431
01:14:30,077 --> 01:14:31,640
And Judas was a traitor!

1432
01:14:31,799 --> 01:14:37,026
So Kid's trying to tell us something! He must be trying
to show us that there's a traitor hidden in our ranks!

1433
01:14:37,113 --> 01:14:40,664
Wait, you're saying someone other
than Kid is targeting the "Sunflowers?

1434
01:14:40,848 --> 01:14:46,876
Adviser Suzuki, would you mind if I took
another look at the profiles of your Seven Samurai?

1435
01:14:46,908 --> 01:14:51,650
What if he's trying to plant seeds of doubt, to
disrupt our security and turn us against each other?

1436
01:14:51,675 --> 01:14:54,788
Well we don't have to led on
that we're investigating them.

1437
01:14:55,081 --> 01:14:58,475
Hmm. In that case, there'd be
no harm in looking into them.

1438
01:14:58,562 --> 01:14:59,225
Go on.

1439
01:14:59,312 --> 01:14:59,952
Got it.

1440
01:15:02,121 --> 01:15:05,085
All guests and employees have been evacuated, sir.

1441
01:15:05,147 --> 01:15:07,363
All right. Make sure all the exits are sealed.

1442
01:15:07,388 --> 01:15:08,936
Yes, sir. Sealing the exits.

1443
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:19,614
Please keep moving forward! Please keep moving!

1444
01:15:19,639 --> 01:15:23,468
Lake Rock Art Museum is being
evacuated en masse as we speak.

1445
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,645
The question is, what went wrong?

1446
01:15:25,670 --> 01:15:28,679
Neither visitors, nor staff, seem to have any info.

1447
01:15:31,818 --> 01:15:36,626
The only places left with lax video
surveillance are the server room and power plant.

1448
01:15:36,856 --> 01:15:40,239
But only a select few know that those are our weak spots.

1449
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:42,767
I'm gonna test it out.

1450
01:15:43,545 --> 01:15:46,938
Hey, this is Charlie. I checked
out all the security blind spots.

1451
01:15:46,994 --> 01:15:48,954
There's no sign of Kid anywhere in the building.

1452
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:49,859
Roger.

1453
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,240
The buildings been fully evacuated,
please return to your posts.

1454
01:15:56,770 --> 01:15:57,282
Hmph.

1455
01:15:58,353 --> 01:15:59,697
It's almost time...

1456
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:00,450
Hm?

1457
01:16:02,161 --> 01:16:02,619
Ah!

1458
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,788
Kid! Stop!

1459
01:16:29,317 --> 01:16:29,737
Huh?!

1460
01:16:30,104 --> 01:16:30,975
What the?!

1461
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:34,543
A blackout?!

1462
01:16:34,568 --> 01:16:37,410
It's okay! Activate the auxiliary generator!

1463
01:16:37,434 --> 01:16:37,698
Right!

1464
01:16:37,723 --> 01:16:39,422
We need to see the "Sunflowers"

1465
01:16:39,447 --> 01:16:40,098
I'm on it!

1466
01:16:42,495 --> 01:16:43,830
Monitors are online!

1467
01:16:45,938 --> 01:16:48,314
They're all here! The paintings are secure.

1468
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:52,912
We need this monitor on too.
Megure's sending me more information!

1469
01:16:52,968 --> 01:16:53,484
Right!

1470
01:16:55,197 --> 01:16:55,828
The light!

1471
01:16:55,877 --> 01:16:58,323
Goto! What in the world is going on out there?!

1472
01:16:59,172 --> 01:17:01,048
There's trouble in the electrical control room!

1473
01:17:01,768 --> 01:17:06,188
Whatever's happened has caused the lights,
elevators, and security cameras to malfunction.

1474
01:17:06,228 --> 01:17:09,502
I'll put extra security on the second and fifth paintings.

1475
01:17:10,009 --> 01:17:13,396
Kid's still here. He must be
hiding somewhere in the building!

1476
01:17:13,475 --> 01:17:16,803
Not necessarily. It may not be Kid, after all.

1477
01:17:16,909 --> 01:17:18,465
Wait, what makes you think that?

1478
01:17:18,678 --> 01:17:22,622
While I was going back over the Seven
Samurai's files, I found something odd.

1479
01:17:23,335 --> 01:17:23,865
What?

1480
01:17:23,921 --> 01:17:24,801
What was odd?

1481
01:17:24,881 --> 01:17:29,017
We know that Van Gogh painted the
seven "Sunflowers" in Arles, France.

1482
01:17:29,556 --> 01:17:33,005
The suspect has a twin brother
who died there six months ago.

1483
01:17:33,878 --> 01:17:36,826
The local police said he died
of a gunshot wound in the chest.

1484
01:17:36,899 --> 01:17:40,740
and ruled it as suicide, since he had
traces of gunpowder smoke on his right hand.

1485
01:17:41,764 --> 01:17:43,712
So what was the name of the victim?

1486
01:17:45,269 --> 01:17:47,019
Koichi Azuma.

1487
01:17:47,192 --> 01:17:48,662
Azuma? Really?

1488
01:17:48,757 --> 01:17:52,206
Yes. Koji Azuma, our restoration specialist's brother.

1489
01:17:52,349 --> 01:17:55,050
It wasn't suicide. I killed Koichi.

1490
01:17:55,503 --> 01:17:57,926
Wait, isn't that him on one of the monitors?

1491
01:17:58,052 --> 01:17:59,523
With the second painting!

1492
01:17:59,884 --> 01:18:02,988
Azuma! Why? He was your brother.

1493
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:08,263
Yes, that's true. But Koichi betrayed
me after we found the Ashiya "Sunflowers."

1494
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:10,622
We had been searching for sot long.

1495
01:18:10,709 --> 01:18:12,729
He found the Ashiya "Sunflowers"?

1496
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:14,112
What are you talking about?

1497
01:18:14,199 --> 01:18:17,171
That "Sunflowers" was destroyed during an air raid.

1498
01:18:17,226 --> 01:18:18,886
That's not what actually happened. - Huh?

1499
01:18:19,498 --> 01:18:22,318
True, there was indeed an air raid.

1500
01:18:22,675 --> 01:18:25,663
The city was an inferno, burning with hellfire.

1501
01:18:27,248 --> 01:18:31,862
My grandfather worked as a carpenter for the
businessman who bought Ashiya's "Sunflowers".

1502
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:35,887
To burglar-proof the painting,
Grandfather fastened it firmly to the wall.

1503
01:18:36,094 --> 01:18:39,534
When the air raid came, he rushed
into his burning house to save it.

1504
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:44,681
Aah!

1505
01:18:50,363 --> 01:18:51,221
Ugh.

1506
01:19:07,825 --> 01:19:08,820
Azuma!

1507
01:19:10,051 --> 01:19:10,758
My lady!

1508
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:13,203
Azuma! What are you...

1509
01:19:13,228 --> 01:19:14,261
Stay back!

1510
01:19:16,453 --> 01:19:17,723
No..!

1511
01:19:20,888 --> 01:19:23,319
My lady! Take care of the "Sunflowers"!

1512
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:25,724
No! Azuma!

1513
01:19:25,773 --> 01:19:26,481
Watch out!

1514
01:19:27,723 --> 01:19:29,367
We need to get out of here, my lady!

1515
01:19:29,423 --> 01:19:30,526
No!

1516
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:32,377
Azuma..!

1517
01:19:32,416 --> 01:19:34,299
Even if we lose this damn war...

1518
01:19:35,030 --> 01:19:37,668
I'll never let them have our "Sunflowers"!

1519
01:19:38,374 --> 01:19:39,652
Azuma...

1520
01:19:40,779 --> 01:19:41,940
Azuma!

1521
01:19:41,965 --> 01:19:44,014
My lady, we have to go!

1522
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:53,692
Japan, our home land... Will one day
have a place to display our own masterpieces.

1523
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:57,687
So people all over the world...

1524
01:19:58,529 --> 01:20:00,928
could see these "Sunflowers"...

1525
01:20:07,781 --> 01:20:10,362
We grew up hearing that story from our father.

1526
01:20:12,572 --> 01:20:16,496
After he died, we continued
searching for the Ashiya "Sunflowers."

1527
01:20:17,161 --> 01:20:21,533
Our only clue was from the servant. To
whom my grandfather entrusted the painting.

1528
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:23,440
So a servant had it?

1529
01:20:23,655 --> 01:20:25,723
He kept is safe from the GHQ.

1530
01:20:26,147 --> 01:20:30,696
To conceal it, he made the painting look like a
counterfeit, which helped him smuggle it into Europe.

1531
01:20:30,821 --> 01:20:33,958
S-So you're saying the "Sunflowers"
I bought at the auction...

1532
01:20:34,132 --> 01:20:36,516
Is the Ashiya "Sunflowers"?!

1533
01:20:36,873 --> 01:20:38,415
Then it wasn't destroyed!

1534
01:20:38,485 --> 01:20:42,133
That's right. My brother and I
finally discovered it's hiding place.

1535
01:20:42,673 --> 01:20:47,389
The Ashiya "Sunflowers", secretly tucked
away in the attic of an old home in Arles.

1536
01:20:48,753 --> 01:20:53,160
Except, finding the "Sunflowers" after
having searched for so many years...

1537
01:20:53,479 --> 01:20:55,782
Had a dramatic effect on my brother.

1538
01:20:57,316 --> 01:21:00,880
He said the "Sunflowers" should
be left in Van Gogh's beloved Arles.

1539
01:21:01,353 --> 01:21:04,411
He even started suggesting, that
we should just destroy it there.

1540
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:09,313
I simply couldn't forgive my brother for
betraying our father and grandfather's wish.

1541
01:21:09,796 --> 01:21:13,078
The argument became a struggle.
He wanted to shoot the painting.

1542
01:21:13,436 --> 01:21:15,534
The gun we kept for protection went off...

1543
01:21:27,855 --> 01:21:28,880
K-Koichi...

1544
01:21:29,109 --> 01:21:30,706
Stay back... -

1545
01:21:34,827 --> 01:21:35,727
Koichi!

1546
01:21:39,969 --> 01:21:41,941
You need to get out of here!

1547
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:42,663
But I..!

1548
01:21:42,798 --> 01:21:43,917
Just go!

1549
01:21:53,771 --> 01:21:54,796
Ugh...

1550
01:22:08,595 --> 01:22:14,697
So that's why, when I learned of this Japanese
Sunflowers exhibit, I offered to join as a curator.

1551
01:22:15,101 --> 01:22:19,615
Because of that choice, I've witnessed
the Ashiya "Sunflowers" returned to Japan.

1552
01:22:20,202 --> 01:22:22,452
Grandfather's dying wish came true.

1553
01:22:24,222 --> 01:22:28,347
After this exhibition was over,
I was going to turn myself in.

1554
01:22:29,554 --> 01:22:31,549
This is a little early, but...

1555
01:22:31,922 --> 01:22:33,305
It all makes sense.

1556
01:22:33,661 --> 01:22:36,897
Megure from the Metro PD is on his way here now.

1557
01:22:36,968 --> 01:22:38,454
You're turning yourself in?

1558
01:22:38,558 --> 01:22:39,209
Yes!

1559
01:22:39,351 --> 01:22:40,129
Of course!

1560
01:22:40,263 --> 01:22:43,823
But I'm not the one you're after. I
had nothing to do with all of this.

1561
01:22:44,378 --> 01:22:45,840
All right, then who did?!

1562
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:48,327
Wait, the sunflowers are on fire!

1563
01:22:48,718 --> 01:22:50,058
What are you playing at?!

1564
01:22:50,083 --> 01:22:51,600
They're literally on fire!

1565
01:22:51,688 --> 01:22:53,004
The fire's here too!

1566
01:22:53,028 --> 01:22:54,189
We need to put it out!

1567
01:22:54,214 --> 01:22:55,955
Hey! What's going on here?!

1568
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,270
What happened to the "Sunflowers" heat sensors?

1569
01:22:58,482 --> 01:23:00,170
The temperature's shooting up!

1570
01:23:00,515 --> 01:23:02,430
There may actually be a fire, sir!

1571
01:23:02,493 --> 01:23:03,853
Can't we extinguish it?!

1572
01:23:03,932 --> 01:23:06,117
No. The fire suppression system is down!

1573
01:23:06,491 --> 01:23:09,961
There's nothing else to do! We need to evacuate everyone!

1574
01:23:10,217 --> 01:23:12,464
Get us access to the roof immediately!

1575
01:23:12,489 --> 01:23:12,845
Yes, sir.

1576
01:23:12,870 --> 01:23:15,238
All right, let's go! Everybody follow me!

1577
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:16,445
Come on, Conan!

1578
01:23:16,834 --> 01:23:17,414
Right!

1579
01:23:19,425 --> 01:23:22,451
Come on you need to hurry! The flames are already here!

1580
01:23:22,514 --> 01:23:23,876
I'm trying... Got it!

1581
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:24,356
Huh?

1582
01:23:25,342 --> 01:23:27,472
All right kid, let's go. Hurry!

1583
01:23:30,443 --> 01:23:31,920
This way, over here!

1584
01:23:32,798 --> 01:23:35,002
Just keep running! Go, go, go!

1585
01:23:36,775 --> 01:23:37,863
Come on, hurry!

1586
01:23:42,370 --> 01:23:43,513
Is everyone all right?

1587
01:23:43,538 --> 01:23:45,380
Yeah, looks like we all made it.

1588
01:23:45,826 --> 01:23:47,042
You okay, Conan?

1589
01:23:47,178 --> 01:23:50,052
Yeah, I'm fine. But what about the "Sunflowers".

1590
01:23:50,322 --> 01:23:53,421
Safe. The emergency procedures should be working.

1591
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:56,060
But "Sunflowers" numbers two ant five...

1592
01:23:56,352 --> 01:23:58,030
Don't worry they'll be all right.

1593
01:23:59,230 --> 01:24:01,899
But I know what I saw back there...

1594
01:24:02,652 --> 01:24:04,759
They were both still on display!

1595
01:24:05,401 --> 01:24:07,451
If we don't do something fast,

1596
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:10,732
"Sunflowers" two and five will turn to ash!

1597
01:24:19,749 --> 01:24:20,892
What's the emergency?

1598
01:24:20,971 --> 01:24:22,278
Never mind. Just land.

1599
01:24:22,326 --> 01:24:22,992
Yes. sir.

1600
01:24:23,238 --> 01:24:27,370
According to Inspector Nakamori,
they'll bring Azuma out the rear entrance.

1601
01:24:30,936 --> 01:24:32,525
Hey, we're over here!

1602
01:24:32,851 --> 01:24:33,383
Ah!

1603
01:24:35,755 --> 01:24:36,417
Hurry!

1604
01:24:42,376 --> 01:24:44,722
Azuma's in Lieutenant
Charlie's custody!

1605
01:24:45,309 --> 01:24:47,176
What in the world is happening here?!

1606
01:24:47,319 --> 01:24:50,878
Sorry, but there's been a fire! We're
going to need an air evac out of here!

1607
01:24:50,989 --> 01:24:51,616
Got it!

1608
01:24:52,302 --> 01:24:53,491
We'll have to take the lead!

1609
01:24:53,577 --> 01:24:54,118
Yeah!

1610
01:24:58,305 --> 01:24:59,965
Huh? Conan..?

1611
01:25:01,094 --> 01:25:02,221
Don't tell me...

1612
01:25:02,374 --> 01:25:03,469
Come on!

1613
01:25:06,155 --> 01:25:10,549
This isn't good... If I don't
hurry, I'll burn with this painting!

1614
01:25:10,579 --> 01:25:10,937
Kid!

1615
01:25:11,082 --> 01:25:11,667
Huh?!

1616
01:25:11,922 --> 01:25:13,805
You?! What are you doing!

1617
01:25:14,168 --> 01:25:15,997
Let's just focus on the paintings!

1618
01:25:16,022 --> 01:25:18,191
Is the fifth "Sunflowers" also stuck?

1619
01:25:18,684 --> 01:25:23,339
No, I was able to get that one free
pretty easily. But I can't pry this one loose!

1620
01:25:23,435 --> 01:25:26,329
If we can't get this one moving
fast, the paints gonna melt!

1621
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:27,361
Make some room!

1622
01:25:28,492 --> 01:25:31,150
Aah! Don't you idiot! This is a "Sunflowers"!

1623
01:25:31,268 --> 01:25:33,436
It's one of man kind's treasures!

1624
01:25:39,482 --> 01:25:40,072
Ugh!

1625
01:25:40,287 --> 01:25:41,207
Did we get it?!

1626
01:25:41,723 --> 01:25:44,712
Ow, hey! You aimed straight for my head!

1627
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,467
This is no time to argue!

1628
01:25:47,078 --> 01:25:49,080
It didn't work. Now what?

1629
01:25:49,431 --> 01:25:52,046
Just how strong did the old man make this thing?

1630
01:25:52,141 --> 01:25:52,765
Conan?!

1631
01:25:52,790 --> 01:25:53,187
Urk!

1632
01:25:53,958 --> 01:25:54,490
Huh?

1633
01:25:55,835 --> 01:25:56,828
Shinichi!

1634
01:25:56,995 --> 01:25:58,973
It's true, you were here, after all!

1635
01:25:59,481 --> 01:26:01,022
Guys, what are you doing?! -

1636
01:26:01,047 --> 01:26:03,041
We have to get out of here right away!

1637
01:26:03,216 --> 01:26:03,660
Ran!

1638
01:26:04,469 --> 01:26:05,813
We're gonna need your help!

1639
01:26:06,114 --> 01:26:07,632
Uh... My help?

1640
01:26:07,664 --> 01:26:09,611
We can't get the "Sunflowers" to budge.

1641
01:26:09,722 --> 01:26:12,151
We need to destroy the wall to get it out of there!

1642
01:26:12,176 --> 01:26:13,503
But that's impossible!

1643
01:26:15,434 --> 01:26:16,688
Ran, you can do it.

1644
01:26:17,061 --> 01:26:19,843
Mm, I'll try. Stand back, Shinichi!

1645
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:21,240
You too!

1646
01:26:26,015 --> 01:26:26,818
Please!

1647
01:26:26,874 --> 01:26:27,699
Ran!

1648
01:26:28,384 --> 01:26:29,901
Haah!

1649
01:26:34,415 --> 01:26:36,860
Haah!

1650
01:26:41,794 --> 01:26:42,335
Yes!

1651
01:26:42,392 --> 01:26:43,056
I did it!

1652
01:26:43,081 --> 01:26:43,692
Good!

1653
01:26:43,963 --> 01:26:45,870
Now let's get go-... Hm?

1654
01:26:46,172 --> 01:26:46,701
Huh? Ah!

1655
01:26:46,765 --> 01:26:47,369
Ran!

1656
01:26:47,950 --> 01:26:48,991
Wait a second!

1657
01:26:54,825 --> 01:26:56,668
What are we gonna do Shinichi?!

1658
01:26:56,714 --> 01:26:58,408
It's okay. Just stand back.

1659
01:26:58,976 --> 01:26:59,557
Mm...

1660
01:27:02,248 --> 01:27:04,127
Hey Jii, can you hear me?

1661
01:27:05,629 --> 01:27:08,061
Stay calm! Do not panic!

1662
01:27:08,315 --> 01:27:09,601
Yes, understood.

1663
01:27:25,214 --> 01:27:25,812
Ran.

1664
01:27:25,836 --> 01:27:26,247
Ah..!

1665
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:29,360
Hold on tight. And don't you dare let go!

1666
01:27:30,128 --> 01:27:31,094
Don't tell me..!

1667
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:34,573
Woah!

1668
01:27:52,624 --> 01:27:54,372
Huh? What now?

1669
01:27:54,468 --> 01:27:58,303
The water tanks have broken open! Looks
like they're leaking all over the cliff!

1670
01:27:58,595 --> 01:28:01,386
With all that water, do you think the fires been put out?

1671
01:28:01,470 --> 01:28:02,442
Hey!

1672
01:28:02,809 --> 01:28:04,334
Have you guys seen Conan?

1673
01:28:04,413 --> 01:28:06,074
Wait, he's not with you guys?

1674
01:28:06,105 --> 01:28:07,647
I thought he'd be here!

1675
01:28:07,829 --> 01:28:09,688
Wait! Ran's missing too!

1676
01:28:09,831 --> 01:28:13,867
Figures! Like I'm not busy enough.
Now where did they run off to?

1677
01:28:13,899 --> 01:28:16,521
This whole time I thought they were right behind us.

1678
01:28:16,587 --> 01:28:18,262
Now she's not answering.

1679
01:28:18,497 --> 01:28:22,799
They might've already made it safely out of the
building! Should I go see if I could find them?

1680
01:28:22,924 --> 01:28:24,235
Yes, please.

1681
01:28:24,481 --> 01:28:26,023
We should help her look for them!

1682
01:28:26,154 --> 01:28:26,864
Yeah!

1683
01:28:27,962 --> 01:28:30,544
Kudo. Don't tell me you...

1684
01:28:37,496 --> 01:28:38,616
You all right, Detective?

1685
01:28:38,641 --> 01:28:39,682
Worry about Ran!

1686
01:28:40,301 --> 01:28:41,382
Ran! Wake up!

1687
01:28:42,342 --> 01:28:44,043
She just swallowed a bunch of water.

1688
01:28:44,347 --> 01:28:45,964
But she's gonna be okay in a second.

1689
01:28:49,596 --> 01:28:50,490
Hey, look!

1690
01:28:50,797 --> 01:28:53,211
Seems like the water pressure is dying down!

1691
01:28:53,714 --> 01:28:56,715
Then there's probably no more water left in the tanks!

1692
01:28:57,785 --> 01:28:59,671
We have to check the "Sunflowers"!

1693
01:29:03,413 --> 01:29:06,138
You knew what the culprit was planning all along?

1694
01:29:06,455 --> 01:29:10,263
Yeah. I knew all those sunflowers would act as a fuse.

1695
01:29:10,372 --> 01:29:12,772
And I figured the tube road could become an aqueduct.

1696
01:29:13,233 --> 01:29:18,111
So the person who suggested planting all
those sunflowers in the tube road is our culprit.

1697
01:29:18,635 --> 01:29:21,526
You got it. Sounds like you finally figured it out.

1698
01:29:22,066 --> 01:29:23,846
Now come on. Let's get out of here.

1699
01:29:24,020 --> 01:29:26,580
Okay, but how are we gonna do that?

1700
01:29:26,905 --> 01:29:30,957
We'll take the tube road to the top
floor, there should be an exit around there.

1701
01:29:31,768 --> 01:29:34,112
Then we can take an elevator shaft to the roof.

1702
01:29:34,969 --> 01:29:37,193
What was your original plan tot get out?

1703
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:37,961
Hm?

1704
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:39,117
You know, escape?

1705
01:29:39,212 --> 01:29:39,669
Hmph.

1706
01:29:39,783 --> 01:29:42,628
Come on, you wouldn't be here unless you had a way out.

1707
01:29:42,842 --> 01:29:47,616
I had an exit route through the cave. I new I
could fly to it and get out of here pretty easily.

1708
01:29:47,973 --> 01:29:51,341
Except I wouldn't be able to
reach it while carrying you and Ran.

1709
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:53,035
Kid.

1710
01:29:53,923 --> 01:29:57,841
Hold on, if you knew the culprit's
plan, why didn't you stop it?

1711
01:29:58,437 --> 01:30:03,053
Well I only knew what they were planning, because
I managed to hack into their computer and steal it.

1712
01:30:03,283 --> 01:30:05,486
But I couldn't tell if they were working alone.

1713
01:30:05,772 --> 01:30:07,733
I was gonna try to fix the power,

1714
01:30:08,083 --> 01:30:11,658
but then Charlie found me and
started chasing me all over the place.

1715
01:30:11,801 --> 01:30:15,408
So I figured I'd give a certain
someone a heads up using a clue.

1716
01:30:15,471 --> 01:30:18,435
I just though you'd be able to solve it quicker than that.

1717
01:30:18,483 --> 01:30:19,722
Well, excuse me!

1718
01:30:19,857 --> 01:30:22,765
Hah. Wait here a second. I'll get my gear.

1719
01:30:26,977 --> 01:30:30,560
I'm gonna make sure it's feasible to
escape from the elevator shaft up ahead.

1720
01:30:31,005 --> 01:30:34,198
Meanwhile, you go on ahead and catch the one behind this.

1721
01:30:34,348 --> 01:30:34,945
All right.

1722
01:30:36,349 --> 01:30:39,623
Cause it'd be a pain if I fell for another cheap trick!

1723
01:30:40,726 --> 01:30:41,251
Hm!

1724
01:30:43,112 --> 01:30:43,730
Yeah.

1725
01:30:44,493 --> 01:30:47,116
Good luck, I'm counting on you to stop them!

1726
01:30:47,771 --> 01:30:48,953
Shinichi...

1727
01:30:48,978 --> 01:30:49,347
Ah.

1728
01:30:50,290 --> 01:30:51,741
Just hold on, Ran.

1729
01:30:56,842 --> 01:30:58,621
Huh... This isn't good.

1730
01:30:59,336 --> 01:31:03,776
It took too long for the fire to be put out,
and now the air pressure in the cave is too low.

1731
01:31:04,436 --> 01:31:07,448
We need to get out of here before this place collapses...

1732
01:31:10,776 --> 01:31:13,660
Please stand back, the gate is now opening.

1733
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:16,274
Please stand back, the gate is now opening.

1734
01:31:18,801 --> 01:31:20,930
Good! The "Sunflowers" are safe.

1735
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:23,877
One, two, three, four, five, six...

1736
01:31:24,026 --> 01:31:26,110
Wait a minute! There are only six here!

1737
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:27,166
Are you sure?!

1738
01:31:27,222 --> 01:31:29,320
It's true! We're missing one!

1739
01:31:29,471 --> 01:31:31,203
What is the meaning of this?!

1740
01:31:36,416 --> 01:31:39,156
Huh?! Where'd the second "Sunflowers" go?!

1741
01:31:39,418 --> 01:31:41,817
The Ashiya "Sunflowers" isn't here!

1742
01:31:41,898 --> 01:31:42,641
Oh, no!

1743
01:31:42,665 --> 01:31:45,886
 Why? Why only the Ashiya Sunflowers ?

1744
01:31:46,012 --> 01:31:46,820
Don't worry!

1745
01:31:46,844 --> 01:31:47,268
Huh?!

1746
01:31:47,387 --> 01:31:48,340
That voice!

1747
01:31:48,494 --> 01:31:50,041
Shinichi Kudo?

1748
01:31:50,329 --> 01:31:55,523
Yeah. I put the Ashiya "Sunflowers" into
its protective case just a little while ago.

1749
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:57,064
Who do you think you are?!

1750
01:31:57,199 --> 01:31:58,827
Mind your own damn business!

1751
01:31:58,929 --> 01:32:01,053
Calm down a minute, and listen to me.

1752
01:32:01,602 --> 01:32:04,199
I've been protecting the "Sunflowers" after all.

1753
01:32:04,429 --> 01:32:09,085
There's a traitor amongst you. I'd be
more worried about the Judas in your ranks.

1754
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:11,995
Huh?! So one of them really is a traitor.

1755
01:32:12,318 --> 01:32:14,567
That's right, but you can rest easy.

1756
01:32:14,804 --> 01:32:16,554
I know who the Judas is.

1757
01:32:16,657 --> 01:32:17,411
Huh?

1758
01:32:17,538 --> 01:32:19,914
Yeah, but Azuma's already been arrested.

1759
01:32:20,406 --> 01:32:23,283
Koji Azuma isn't the traitor I'm talking about.

1760
01:32:23,441 --> 01:32:26,840
Makes sense. If you think about
it, the last thing that Azuma

1761
01:32:26,865 --> 01:32:29,836
wanted was for the Ashiya
"Sunflowers" to come to any harm.

1762
01:32:30,312 --> 01:32:35,240
Besides, when the sunflowers started
to burn, he was on camera talking to you.

1763
01:32:35,526 --> 01:32:37,044
That may be true, but...

1764
01:32:37,448 --> 01:32:40,158
I can't believe anyone here would be a traitor.

1765
01:32:40,372 --> 01:32:44,280
Yeah. We've done everything we
can to protect the "Sunflowers."

1766
01:32:44,455 --> 01:32:48,363
That's right, and Kid's the one who
suggested there even was a traitor.

1767
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:52,670
It'd be down right crazy to believe
a thief's word. Especially right now.

1768
01:32:52,852 --> 01:32:53,924
Exactly!

1769
01:32:54,055 --> 01:32:57,804
We should just be relieved that all
the "Sunflowers" made it out safely.

1770
01:32:57,852 --> 01:33:00,854
Really, now? Is that how you feel?

1771
01:33:01,021 --> 01:33:03,739
Even though you were the one that lit the fuse?

1772
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:05,034
What are you saying?

1773
01:33:05,391 --> 01:33:10,572
You were the one trying to destroy the Ashiya
"Sunflowers" and the fifth "Sunflowers" in that fire.

1774
01:33:11,302 --> 01:33:16,394
Destroying those two "Sunflowers" masterpieces
has been your goal from the very beginning.

1775
01:33:16,441 --> 01:33:18,182
That's just utter nonsense!

1776
01:33:18,212 --> 01:33:20,223
Why would I want to do something like that?!

1777
01:33:20,334 --> 01:33:21,423
All right then.

1778
01:33:21,725 --> 01:33:24,204
Let's go over the details, shall we?

1779
01:33:24,730 --> 01:33:28,185
After Kid the Phantom Thief
caused a ruckus at the auction,

1780
01:33:28,265 --> 01:33:32,887
they beefed up security. This prevented you
from getting your hands on the "Sunflowers."

1781
01:33:32,911 --> 01:33:33,271
Huh?

1782
01:33:33,502 --> 01:33:38,468
You gave up on destroying it in America,
but when you found it'd be flown to Japan,

1783
01:33:38,682 --> 01:33:43,504
you bribed one of the workers and planted
a bomb on the door near the cargo bay.

1784
01:33:44,134 --> 01:33:46,189
But Kid interfered there, too.

1785
01:33:46,279 --> 01:33:50,779
So you decided to change your target
from the second, to the fifth "Sunflowers."

1786
01:33:50,803 --> 01:33:51,210
Ugh.

1787
01:33:52,124 --> 01:33:54,279
Kid, figured that out pretty quickly,

1788
01:33:54,763 --> 01:33:58,925
So he sent a clue to Detective
Mori, resulting in heightened security.

1789
01:33:59,909 --> 01:34:04,772
Kid had foiled your plans twice in a
row. So to finally get the jump on him,

1790
01:34:05,145 --> 01:34:09,468
you stuck a fake Kid card in the
fifth "Sunflowers" transport box.

1791
01:34:10,065 --> 01:34:12,576
Your goal was to get it back to your studio.

1792
01:34:13,293 --> 01:34:17,350
Are you saying Kid played the villain
in order to protect the "Sunflowers"?

1793
01:34:17,405 --> 01:34:20,576
It's a lie! All these connections
are just your imagination!

1794
01:34:20,631 --> 01:34:24,691
I believe her! Natsumi loves Van
Gogh's "Sunflowers" more than anyone!

1795
01:34:24,817 --> 01:34:27,003
So there's no way she'd want to harm them!

1796
01:34:27,217 --> 01:34:31,293
Yeah. Besides, why would she
only want to destroy those two?

1797
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:36,790
Good point, I still haven't figured out
why only those two paintings were her target.

1798
01:34:37,044 --> 01:34:38,744
This detective show is a farce!

1799
01:34:38,982 --> 01:34:42,859
Well, we'll be getting the truth
from Natsumi herself soon enough.

1800
01:34:43,727 --> 01:34:44,831
Allow me.

1801
01:34:45,442 --> 01:34:48,335
Natsumi, I heard you were the one who suggesting

1802
01:34:48,359 --> 01:34:51,568
decorating Lake Rock's tube
road with all those sunflowers.

1803
01:34:51,846 --> 01:34:52,733
Is that true?

1804
01:34:52,757 --> 01:34:54,173
Well, yes.

1805
01:34:54,521 --> 01:34:57,605
You used your position as an appraiser to get turpentine,

1806
01:34:57,718 --> 01:34:59,870
which is often used to restore paintings.

1807
01:35:00,092 --> 01:35:03,485
pouring it into the sunflower
gardens from the top floor down,

1808
01:35:03,565 --> 01:35:06,099
turned the whole place into a giant fuse.

1809
01:35:06,248 --> 01:35:10,649
The real traitor took advantage of this
situation. I had nothing to do with it!

1810
01:35:11,222 --> 01:35:15,713
How dare you try to pin this on me,
and with only circumstantial evidence!

1811
01:35:16,125 --> 01:35:20,120
Really now. I was hoping you'd confess, to be honest.

1812
01:35:20,764 --> 01:35:24,109
But if you need more proof,
then I'll show it to you later.

1813
01:35:24,695 --> 01:35:30,027
The files on your computer contain your
plan to destroy those two "Sunflowers".

1814
01:35:33,429 --> 01:35:36,363
I guess there's no point in continuing this charade.

1815
01:35:36,498 --> 01:35:38,752
So that's the real reason you're here, huh?

1816
01:35:38,905 --> 01:35:43,726
You only joined us because you wanted to
destroy the fifth and the Ashiya "Sunflowers."

1817
01:35:43,839 --> 01:35:44,704
That's right!

1818
01:35:44,981 --> 01:35:48,000
You see, Kid the Phantom Thief
just kept getting in the way,

1819
01:35:48,057 --> 01:35:50,304
so things didn't go exactly as I'd planned.

1820
01:35:50,637 --> 01:35:55,334
When Kid's interference proved to be too
much, you started a fire here at Lake Rock.

1821
01:35:55,604 --> 01:35:58,536
You wanted those two "Sunflowers" to turn to ash.

1822
01:35:58,599 --> 01:36:02,786
Yes. But it wasn't my intention to cause this much damage.

1823
01:36:03,571 --> 01:36:08,529
My plan was to create a blackout to use
as cover and dispose of the two Sunflowers.

1824
01:36:08,870 --> 01:36:10,753
Then it would have been all over.

1825
01:36:11,565 --> 01:36:14,114
But Kid and then a staff member got in my way.

1826
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:18,390
I'll put extra security on the second and fifth paintings.

1827
01:36:19,025 --> 01:36:21,202
How did you tamper with the sunflowers?

1828
01:36:21,270 --> 01:36:24,022
Our security system would notice that something is wrong!

1829
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:24,964
Hah, easy!

1830
01:36:25,071 --> 01:36:25,641
Huh?

1831
01:36:25,698 --> 01:36:27,840
It merely took covering them with Phosphine.

1832
01:36:28,036 --> 01:36:29,234
Wait! Phosphine.

1833
01:36:29,511 --> 01:36:33,426
It's a chemical that can spontaneously
combust at room temperature.

1834
01:36:33,672 --> 01:36:36,834
So you're the one who sent that gift and tried to kill me?

1835
01:36:37,358 --> 01:36:41,323
I see! If the sponsor died, the
opening would have to be delayed,

1836
01:36:41,378 --> 01:36:44,707
and the entire exhibition itself may even be canceled!

1837
01:36:44,773 --> 01:36:45,836
Why Natsumi?

1838
01:36:46,145 --> 01:36:48,831
Between this fire and the explosion on the plane...

1839
01:36:49,053 --> 01:36:52,884
One wrong move and you could've been killed!
Not to mention all of the innocent people.

1840
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:54,470
That's just...

1841
01:36:55,513 --> 01:36:58,652
That's how much I love Van Gogh's "Sunflower!

1842
01:36:58,746 --> 01:37:01,619
I would rather die than let
those two counterfeits be displayed

1843
01:37:01,644 --> 01:37:04,624
next to masterpieces like Van Gogh's real "Sunflowers"!

1844
01:37:05,221 --> 01:37:08,288
Neither your actions, nor your motives truly add up.

1845
01:37:09,066 --> 01:37:12,857
There's a dissertation from the Art
Institute of Chicago that proves it...

1846
01:37:12,951 --> 01:37:15,638
The fifth "Sunflowers" is the genuine article.

1847
01:37:16,733 --> 01:37:20,650
Van Gogh and Gauguin split the
same canvas to make their paintings.

1848
01:37:21,008 --> 01:37:22,588
That's more than enough proof.

1849
01:37:22,961 --> 01:37:26,210
An appraiser like you should
know that much at the very least.

1850
01:37:26,245 --> 01:37:27,237
B-but I...

1851
01:37:27,649 --> 01:37:31,035
And that whole thing you said
about dying for true masterpieces?

1852
01:37:31,105 --> 01:37:33,950
Before you forced the plane down with your explosive,

1853
01:37:34,012 --> 01:37:39,154
and set this fire, you had already prepared
an escape route that would get you to safety.

1854
01:37:39,710 --> 01:37:40,880
Th-That was...

1855
01:37:40,941 --> 01:37:43,436
If you were really willing to die for your plan,

1856
01:37:43,539 --> 01:37:47,242
why didn't you stay behind to
guarantee Kid didn't put out the fire?

1857
01:37:47,877 --> 01:37:52,652
In the end, you're just a criminal,
who can't think of anyone but yourself.

1858
01:37:53,661 --> 01:37:55,290
You're no curator.

1859
01:37:56,076 --> 01:37:57,904
You had me fooled, Natsumi.

1860
01:37:58,039 --> 01:37:59,532
Time to take you in.

1861
01:38:01,002 --> 01:38:03,704
A woman obsessed with Van Gogh's paintings,

1862
01:38:03,846 --> 01:38:08,963
she had more faith in her own beliefs than
the truth of an appraisal, and turned to crime.

1863
01:38:10,211 --> 01:38:12,293
Sounds like you've got everything wrapped things up.

1864
01:38:12,357 --> 01:38:14,112
I do. Did you find a way out?

1865
01:38:14,207 --> 01:38:16,358
Yeah, but I'm the only one that can reach it.

1866
01:38:16,429 --> 01:38:17,449
So now what?

1867
01:38:17,582 --> 01:38:18,742
Should we call for help?

1868
01:38:18,902 --> 01:38:20,283
Not a good idea.

1869
01:38:20,350 --> 01:38:23,162
If someone tried to rescue us,
it could just make things worse.

1870
01:38:23,319 --> 01:38:24,283
Oh no!

1871
01:38:28,120 --> 01:38:29,072
Are you okay?

1872
01:38:29,159 --> 01:38:31,209
Yeah, but we need to get out of here!

1873
01:38:31,289 --> 01:38:33,537
I'm surprised we haven't already been crushed.

1874
01:38:33,926 --> 01:38:38,152
All it would take is a small hole in the
ceiling, to change the air pressure, an we'd be dead!

1875
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:38,915
Hey, Kid!

1876
01:38:39,447 --> 01:38:41,258
Can you fly with just Ran?

1877
01:38:41,305 --> 01:38:42,485
No, you've got to be kidding!

1878
01:38:42,510 --> 01:38:44,451
Can you do it or not?!

1879
01:38:44,620 --> 01:38:46,064
Well? Tell me!

1880
01:38:46,685 --> 01:38:47,181
Hmph.

1881
01:38:47,678 --> 01:38:48,920
I could do it with Ran.

1882
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:52,473
However, I'm not sure I can
keep airborne in a place with low

1883
01:38:52,498 --> 01:38:55,838
atmospheric pressure while
dodging all those falling rocks...

1884
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:15,373
Ugh!

1885
01:39:17,473 --> 01:39:18,663
Ran!

1886
01:39:22,383 --> 01:39:23,290
Kid!

1887
01:39:23,462 --> 01:39:24,629
Ah! Ugh!

1888
01:39:26,107 --> 01:39:28,227
Save Ran!

1889
01:39:28,517 --> 01:39:30,788
Damn it! Stop trying to be cool.

1890
01:39:30,813 --> 01:39:31,439
Woah!

1891
01:39:37,681 --> 01:39:38,351
Ugh!

1892
01:39:44,057 --> 01:39:45,628
There's still a way out of here.

1893
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:47,608
With this child's body...

1894
01:39:53,934 --> 01:39:56,292
Damn, at this rate we're gonna fall!

1895
01:39:56,475 --> 01:39:57,848
Where's the way out?

1896
01:39:59,783 --> 01:40:00,667
There it is!

1897
01:40:07,241 --> 01:40:09,368
Go!

1898
01:40:10,225 --> 01:40:13,582
This pint sized body should
fit into "Sunflowers" elevator.

1899
01:40:13,614 --> 01:40:14,431
Ran!

1900
01:40:34,942 --> 01:40:36,460
The Ashiya "Sunflowers"!

1901
01:40:37,031 --> 01:40:38,907
Oh no! The water tower...

1902
01:40:38,977 --> 01:40:41,074
We have to find those two, fast.

1903
01:40:41,099 --> 01:40:42,330
That looks dangerous!

1904
01:40:42,519 --> 01:40:43,872
Huh?, look!

1905
01:40:49,879 --> 01:40:52,787
No... They're not still in there, are they?

1906
01:40:58,214 --> 01:41:02,115
Woah that was close. I can't
believe we made it out of there.

1907
01:41:02,424 --> 01:41:04,536
Ugh... Shinichi?

1908
01:41:05,314 --> 01:41:06,949
You came to save me...

1909
01:41:07,442 --> 01:41:09,900
Well of course. You'll be safe with me.

1910
01:41:10,344 --> 01:41:11,385
Thank you...

1911
01:41:16,257 --> 01:41:18,052
Where are you going, Haibara?

1912
01:41:18,242 --> 01:41:19,927
Kid and Ran are in the air!

1913
01:41:20,176 --> 01:41:20,863
Huh?

1914
01:41:20,887 --> 01:41:22,048
Is she for real?!

1915
01:41:22,073 --> 01:41:22,640
Let's follow her!

1916
01:41:22,665 --> 01:41:22,978
Yeah!

1917
01:41:23,003 --> 01:41:24,217
Hey, Sonoko!

1918
01:41:24,242 --> 01:41:24,659
Huh?

1919
01:41:24,683 --> 01:41:26,894
Ai said Ran and Kid are flying.

1920
01:41:27,255 --> 01:41:29,286
Wait Ran and Kid are flying?

1921
01:41:29,518 --> 01:41:30,326
What the?

1922
01:41:33,910 --> 01:41:36,270
Damn it. That way's blocked, too?

1923
01:41:36,539 --> 01:41:38,225
Looks like I'm out of exit.

1924
01:41:38,939 --> 01:41:41,600
At this rate, the Ashiya "Sunflowers" and I are...

1925
01:41:59,718 --> 01:42:01,024
Are you serious?

1926
01:42:06,896 --> 01:42:10,734
Please tell me you were able to escape... Detective?

1927
01:42:14,245 --> 01:42:15,296
Ran!

1928
01:42:15,693 --> 01:42:18,345
Ran! Where are you?!

1929
01:42:22,628 --> 01:42:24,963
Ran! Ran, are you all right?

1930
01:42:25,313 --> 01:42:25,844
Ugh...

1931
01:42:26,463 --> 01:42:28,554
Oh, is that you Dad..?

1932
01:42:31,098 --> 01:42:31,770
Ran!

1933
01:42:31,938 --> 01:42:34,061
Are you hurt? Are you okay?!

1934
01:42:34,871 --> 01:42:37,816
Mmhm. Shinichi came and saved me...

1935
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:38,266
Huh?!

1936
01:42:38,771 --> 01:42:41,451
Nuh-uh! Kid was the one that saved you.

1937
01:42:41,577 --> 01:42:43,968
On his glider! You were like whoosh!

1938
01:42:44,064 --> 01:42:45,486
You don't remember that?

1939
01:42:45,581 --> 01:42:48,512
Urk! Wait, you mean it was Kid?

1940
01:42:48,949 --> 01:42:51,841
But I thought for sure it was Shinichi...

1941
01:42:52,549 --> 01:42:55,300
So what happened to the brat? Where is he?

1942
01:42:55,662 --> 01:42:57,562
Huh?! Conan isn't here?

1943
01:42:57,680 --> 01:43:00,645
No. Kid was only carrying you, no one else.

1944
01:43:01,334 --> 01:43:02,114
Oh, no!

1945
01:43:03,774 --> 01:43:05,585
Then Conan's still...

1946
01:43:09,693 --> 01:43:10,455
No way!

1947
01:43:10,493 --> 01:43:11,498
Conan...

1948
01:43:17,593 --> 01:43:18,355
Damn!

1949
01:43:19,316 --> 01:43:24,169
Tsk. So much for escaping, I'm gonna
drown in less than a minute down here!

1950
01:43:24,708 --> 01:43:27,748
If I shoot the ball out, it
might be able to move this thing,

1951
01:43:28,079 --> 01:43:30,485
but it won't keep me from being submerged.

1952
01:43:30,826 --> 01:43:32,630
That's it! Submerged!

1953
01:43:33,784 --> 01:43:39,234
With this much water is pouring in, it
must mean I'm below the lake's war level!

1954
01:43:39,742 --> 01:43:43,914
So if I can use my fireworks ball to
change the direction it's collapsing,

1955
01:43:44,263 --> 01:43:46,979
the atmospheric pressure will fall out of balance...

1956
01:43:47,012 --> 01:43:48,473
It's a long shot but...

1957
01:43:49,811 --> 01:43:51,827
It might thrust me into the lake!

1958
01:43:51,874 --> 01:43:53,590
All right! Time to go!

1959
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:57,198
Five, four, three...

1960
01:43:57,475 --> 01:44:00,215
two, one, zero!

1961
01:44:09,544 --> 01:44:12,584
Conan!

1962
01:44:12,609 --> 01:44:14,340
What are you doing, Conan!

1963
01:44:14,572 --> 01:44:16,510
Please find a way out!

1964
01:44:16,677 --> 01:44:18,932
Damn it, what the hell's he doing?

1965
01:44:19,944 --> 01:44:21,380
Conan!

1966
01:44:22,508 --> 01:44:24,400
Don't worry, he'll be okay...

1967
01:44:24,623 --> 01:44:26,465
Knowing Conan, I'm sure he...

1968
01:44:28,158 --> 01:44:30,812
Please, Conan. Make it out...

1969
01:44:31,430 --> 01:44:32,662
You can do it!

1970
01:44:45,009 --> 01:44:48,100
Almost... Just a little more...

1971
01:44:52,605 --> 01:44:54,018
There's something on the water!

1972
01:44:56,125 --> 01:44:57,320
The "Sunflowers"!

1973
01:44:57,363 --> 01:44:59,746
Ah, it made it after all! -

1974
01:44:59,771 --> 01:45:03,050
But wait a second, Conan was in
the case with that "Sunflowers"!

1975
01:45:03,074 --> 01:45:03,355
Huh?

1976
01:45:03,562 --> 01:45:05,790
So Conan must be somewhere nearby!

1977
01:45:06,375 --> 01:45:08,567
Everyone help me find Conan!

1978
01:45:08,632 --> 01:45:09,494
Conan!

1979
01:45:09,518 --> 01:45:10,394
Where are you?!

1980
01:45:10,434 --> 01:45:12,745
Where could you be?! Conan!

1981
01:45:13,987 --> 01:45:15,786
Conan!

1982
01:45:19,997 --> 01:45:21,706
Mm... Ran...

1983
01:45:25,901 --> 01:45:27,728
Huh?! Look guys!

1984
01:45:27,832 --> 01:45:29,387
Yeah! From under the painting!

1985
01:45:29,411 --> 01:45:29,851
Huh?

1986
01:45:29,938 --> 01:45:30,507
Where?

1987
01:45:30,539 --> 01:45:31,241
Huh?!

1988
01:45:39,790 --> 01:45:41,918
I'm coming for ya kid! Hup!

1989
01:45:42,681 --> 01:45:44,042
Oh Conan...

1990
01:45:44,602 --> 01:45:45,654
Hey, are you gonna be okay?

1991
01:45:45,725 --> 01:45:47,617
Good going, little guy!

1992
01:45:47,751 --> 01:45:50,563
I expect no less from my Kid Catcher!

1993
01:45:50,928 --> 01:45:52,096
Haha!

1994
01:45:53,812 --> 01:45:55,045
You all right, brat?

1995
01:45:55,112 --> 01:45:55,831
Yeah.

1996
01:45:55,925 --> 01:45:58,779
You protected the "Sunflowers"! Good work!

1997
01:46:00,186 --> 01:46:03,050
Taking all the sweet moments for himself.

1998
01:46:03,315 --> 01:46:03,880
Hm?

1999
01:46:04,110 --> 01:46:07,567
There's still something I don't get.
Why don't you help me understand it?

2000
01:46:07,614 --> 01:46:08,063
Huh?

2001
01:46:08,087 --> 01:46:10,590
How'd you know the real identity of the criminal?

2002
01:46:11,457 --> 01:46:14,025
She left a voice message trying to hire me.

2003
01:46:14,588 --> 01:46:18,243
She said she wanted me to steal
the second and fifth "Sunflowers".

2004
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,459
I see.

2005
01:46:19,864 --> 01:46:24,924
You have a talent for disguises, so I'm
sure you knew right away by voice alone

2006
01:46:24,949 --> 01:46:26,529
who had tried to contact you.

2007
01:46:26,839 --> 01:46:30,017
But why did you feel compelled
to interfere with her planes?

2008
01:46:30,151 --> 01:46:31,996
What were you gonna get out of it?

2009
01:46:32,154 --> 01:46:35,817
I wanted a certain someone to see the Ashiya "Sunflowers."

2010
01:46:35,879 --> 01:46:37,254
What are you talking about?

2011
01:46:37,580 --> 01:46:41,060
That day, amid the furious flames of an air raid.

2012
01:46:41,385 --> 01:46:45,547
a carpenter entrusted that "Sunflowers"
to the woman who secretly loved him,

2013
01:46:45,572 --> 01:46:48,385
then died before her eyes. She's the one.

2014
01:46:49,122 --> 01:46:52,151
But how could you know about
something that happened so long ago?

2015
01:46:52,176 --> 01:46:55,607
Hmph. I heard the story from an
old man who witnessed the whole thing.

2016
01:46:56,519 --> 01:47:00,614
He lived with them. Back then he
was one of their most trusted servants.

2017
01:47:02,584 --> 01:47:07,565
The student who saved his ft love from
that sea of fire asked me for a favor.

2018
01:47:08,866 --> 01:47:11,529
To show her the Ashiya "Sunflowers."

2019
01:47:12,172 --> 01:47:14,206
Huh..? Hm.

2020
01:47:15,009 --> 01:47:18,282
I see. Then that solves everything.

2021
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:20,753
Are you sure? You won't arrest me?

2022
01:47:20,888 --> 01:47:23,518
I'm letting you go. Just this once.

2023
01:47:23,572 --> 01:47:27,452
Hmph. You don't have it in you
to take me in, do you officer?

2024
01:47:27,809 --> 01:47:30,343
In honor of your friend and that doomed love,

2025
01:47:30,644 --> 01:47:33,355
and because he trusted you to give him a hand...

2026
01:47:33,545 --> 01:47:35,920
Well, let's just say I'll turn a blind eye.

2027
01:47:36,634 --> 01:47:39,875
It looks like I may have misjudged you, Charlie.

2028
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:42,474
The feeling's mutual.

2029
01:47:45,848 --> 01:47:46,391
Hmph.

2030
01:51:49,603 --> 01:51:52,293
It's not here! Or here! Or here?!

2031
01:51:52,318 --> 01:51:53,874
Where is it? Where'd it go?

2032
01:51:54,017 --> 01:51:59,007
If I still can't find it after looking this
hard, then someone must have stolen the darn thing!

2033
01:51:59,221 --> 01:52:02,693
But who?! Who the heck stole my ticket?

2034
01:52:02,804 --> 01:52:05,673
So, you're not gonna tell him
the exhibition's been canceled?

2035
01:52:05,943 --> 01:52:07,861
He'd find out if he watched the news.

2036
01:52:07,885 --> 01:52:08,192
Huh?

2037
01:52:08,407 --> 01:52:10,647
What the heck? That's not very nice.

2038
01:52:10,686 --> 01:52:13,489
If I look at you too much, I
