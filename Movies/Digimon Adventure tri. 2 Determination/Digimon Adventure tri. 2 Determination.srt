-You just have to kick. -And paddle and breathe

162
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,767
and that whole not sinking thing's pretty important.

163
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,269
It's pretty easy to figure it out.

164
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,770
Once you've figured it out.

165
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:29,075
Okay, I think I got it. [inhales]

166
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,944
-[water ripples] -[all sigh]

167
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:35,615
-Meiko! Look, I'm floating. -Good job.

168
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,850
[Himekawa] You do know that's for feet soaking, right?

169
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,119
-Oh, sorry. -Hey.

170
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,587
Hime! You came!

171
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,289
You and Meicoomon look like you're doing well.

172
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,657
We are.

173
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,691
Hmm?

174
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:48,861
-Hi there. -[gasps]

175
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,764
Thanks for your help the other day.

176
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:58,004
-This your big sister? -Huh? Sister?

177
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,207
-What's up? -Hey! It's that lady.

178
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,776
Oh, hey, Tai. There's Hemi.

179
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:04,343
[grumbles]

180
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,013
-What'd you call her? -[Mimi] Oh!

181
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,714
So, were you two on a date?

182
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,016
Is she your girlfriend?

183
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,085
-Well, ex. -[laughs excitedly]

184
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,220
-[slaps] -Ow!

185
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:15,888
-[groans] -[Himekawa] Don't over share!

186
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:19,325
[Mimi] No! Tell me more. Over, over share!

187
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:22,328
[Sora] So, you already knew Miss Himekawa?

188
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:25,264
[Meiko] Yes, she's been really nice to me.

189
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:28,401
She's been helping me out ever since I first moved here.

190
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,736
I think she really worries about me since I'm one

191
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,871
of the Digidestined.

192
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,141
Really? You mean, government agents

193
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,410
actually have feelings? That's hard to believe.

194
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:37,476
[chuckles]

195
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:42,214
[Matt] So, the Digimon have been safe being out in the open

196
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,183
because you two have been tailing us?

197
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:47,053
[Nishijima] No, we've helped, but this is the only area

198
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,189
we're guarding. Our unit is elite but small.

199
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:50,923
Oh, I see.

200
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,893
Even though Digimon have generated a lot

201
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,295
of concern among the population,

202
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,731
they haven't affected daily routines enough yet

203
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,733
to warrant more personnel.

204
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,437
-Wait. You patrol every day? -[Nishijima] Ooh! Hot!

205
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,839
-You Okay? -Yeah.

206
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,240
[blows air]

207
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,945
Don't worry. Things have been calm.

208
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,715
And we intend to make sure it stays that way.

209
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,150
-Mei, say \"Aah\". -Aah!

210
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,452
[slurps]

211
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,121
-[Meiko] Tasty? -No, it's yummy.

212
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:23,222
[chuckles]

213
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,925
Is she a rookie, like Palmon?

214
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,227
No, she's a champion-level Digimon.

215
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,395
For real?

216
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:32,698
-Garumon's champion-level, too. -So, does she have wings

217
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,267
-when she Digivolves? -[Meiko] I don't know.

218
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,470
She hasn't actually Digivolved yet.

219
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:41,874
Really? Well, that's okay. Hey, you know, after we eat,

220
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,843
we should go and play some kind of a game

221
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:46,212
or something. Like those throwing stars.

222
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:47,747
-[Meiko] Okay. -[whirs, thuds]

223
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:54,086
-Chocolate milk or vanilla? -Why not just

224
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,224
milk-flavored milk? [gasps] Oh, drums!

225
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,393
[drum beats]

226
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,262
[Meicoomon] Wow, look! How pretty!

227
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,030
Huh?

228
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,332
Um...

229
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,236
Meiko? Meiko?

230
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,809
Oh!

231
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,947
Hm.

232
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:28,954
Meicoomon. Oh, thank goodness. You're okay.

233
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:35,361
-I got lost. -I was so worried.

234
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,763
Please, don't wander off like that.

235
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:38,831
Okay.

236
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,233
-Huh? -Oh.

237
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,904
-You okay? -Um, yeah.

238
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,006
This is just the first time either of us have been

239
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,207
-to a spa. -Oh, right.

240
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:52,344
Guess we should've asked you what you wanted to see.

241
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,546
-Sorry. -No!

242
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,415
I should apologize. It's all because of me

243
00:11:56,449 --> 00:12:00,152
-you even had to make this trip. -No, actually, this was really

244
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,421
-for Tai and my brother. -It-- what?

245
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,858
-They're fighting again? -Oh.

246
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,993
-Yeah. -So, you and Matt

247
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,129
are brothers? But your last names--

248
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:13,199
Our folks divorced when we were little and our mom remarried.

249
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,267
That's why we have different last names.

250
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,537
-Oh! -It's no big deal or anything.

251
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,874
And you're still close, huh? That's great.

252
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,976
Huh? Yep.

253
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:28,547
-Gabumon, come on! -It's super fun!

254
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,218
Stop, you guys. I told you, I'm good.

255
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:36,122
Uh-oh. Sora? I forgot my glasses' case.

256
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,424
-Meicoomon. -Coming.

257
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:41,927
-Oh, wait for me. -Stay with Meicoo, Biyomon.

258
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,295
We're getting into the bath.

259
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,931
[Jazz music plays]

260
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,102
[Meicoomon sighs] That's what I'm talking about.

261
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,537
[Mimi] So relaxing.

262
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,373
[Meiko shrieks] Except something is in the water with us!

263
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,609
[Meicoomon] That was just me. Sorry.

264
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:59,445
-[Mimi] Oh, yeah. Of course. -[Sora] What's happening?

265
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:02,314
-[Meicoomon] Ah! It's Sora. -[Sora] The rumors are true.

266
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,449
-[Biyomon] Get in. -[splash]

267
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:04,550
[Sora shrieks]

268
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,319
[Sora] Guess there's no choice when you pull me in!

269
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,087
[sighs]

270
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,257
[Meicoomon] Told you jumping in was the best way!

271
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,497
[Meicoomon] It's gotta be here somewhere.

272
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,099
[Biyomon] Be careful.

273
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,101
-Oh, no! -[grunts]

274
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,104
-Meicoomon! -Don't worry. It's fluffy.

275
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,338
-[gasps] -[chuckles]

276
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,873
I want fluff too!

277
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,542
[Biyomon] Oh yea! That's the stuff!

278
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:32,044
[laughter]

279
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,381
Oh, no. Act like stuffed animals.

280
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:40,920
Found it. Sorry for making you--

281
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:41,287
[sighs]

282
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,257
You know? Meiko hasn't come back yet.

283
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:49,128
-You think she got lost? -[Meiko] Meicoomon and Biyomon!

284
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,396
They're missing!

285
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:51,897
[Nishijima sighs]

286
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,434
-Old geezer. -Hey, I'm not that old yet.

287
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:56,569
-Am I? -Yes.

288
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:03,442
Listen... can you tell us more about these infected Digimon?

289
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:06,212
-What's the deal? -Hmm...

290
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,115
-Honestly, I don't know much. -What?

291
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,451
I thought that you were connected.

292
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,920
Sorry, but I'm just middle management.

293
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,556
So, you're like Missy Makawa's gopher?

294
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,425
Watch it, smart guy.

295
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:24,697
Hello?

296
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,600
Not over here. Or here.

297
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:28,133
[sighs]

298
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,438
-What're you doing? Come on! -[Meiko] Sorry! Mimi!

299
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,574
-[grunting, panting] -It's okay.

300
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,243
Meiko... [whimpers]

301
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,450
-Bet you this is the exit. -I hope you're right.

302
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,051
[grunts]

303
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:52,524
-Now, where are we? -Right back where we started.

304
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,127
-Whoa... -[both yelp]

305
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:58,931
[groans] Dad!

306
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:08,073
-[Meicoomon] Oh, boy. -Poor Mei.

307
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,441
[Sora] Meicoomon is with Biyomon.

308
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:10,109
They'll be all right.

309
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,479
Those two kids completely freaked my son out.

310
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:16,148
Who wears costumes at a spa for crying out loud?

311
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:19,418
-[Gomamon] I'll go check it out. -[Sora] Not alone, you won't.

312
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:20,552
[water splashes]

313
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,292
[sighs]

314
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,402
-[panting] -Ow!

315
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:38,504
Sorry.

316
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:41,140
[Meiko] The men's room. The forbidden realm.

317
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:44,243
-I wonder if they have snacks. -Anyway, follow me.

318
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,546
[Mimi] Ladies, uh-- no, just gentlemen.

319
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,582
I am here... to sing!

00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,172
It'll be great! Everyone's gonna love it.

482
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,674
Just trust me on this, okay?

483
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,576
[girl sighs] Well, if there's really

484
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,112
no one else who wants to volunteer...

485
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:10,515
If you want, I can volunteer for more!

486
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,918
-This will totally rock! -[Meiko groans]

487
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:15,153
[Mimi chuckles]

488
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,856
[Mimi] If this isn't the cutest skirt ever,

489
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:19,057
it's close.

490
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,628
You're incredible.

491
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:27,165
-Yeah? Why is that? -Well, because you're new,

492
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,968
but you just stood up and volunteered.

493
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:32,204
You speak your mind. I could never do that.

494
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,272
Of course, you could. Anyone can.

495
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,241
I just wouldn't feel comfortable.

496
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:37,576
Why?

497
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,846
[stammers] Oh, well...

498
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,849
No point in bottling it all up.

499
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:46,017
And worrying what others will think.

500
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,286
Staying quiet in public just means feeling frustrated

501
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,688
in private later.

502
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,857
It's awful. If you can't ask for what

503
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,825
you want, how are you gonna get it?

504
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,660
Oh! How about this?

505
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,096
[Meiko] Is that a handkerchief?

506
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:01,733
It's a skirt! Come on, Mei Mei. Try it on.

507
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:06,705
What? No way. I can't. It's way too short.

508
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:09,574
What? [chuckles] But that's the best part.

509
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,810
[Biyomon] Finally, there's Mimi!

510
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,813
And Meiko. Good. Up!

511
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,715
[Meiko chuckling] What are you wearing, Mei?

512
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:17,983
Costumes for lunch.

513
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,719
-For lunch? -Not to eat, silly goose.

514
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:23,788
They're disguises. Aren't they just adorable?

515
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:27,058
-I am a Geisha. -I am a costumed Digimon.

516
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:29,961
-You don't say. -[giggles]

517
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:38,169
-Hmm. What are you drawing? -Cafe uniforms.

518
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,806
Kind of like costumes for when you pretend to work.

519
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,308
[Meicoomon] You're supposed to be worms?

520
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:46,811
-[Mimi] No! -Oh, sorry. [whimpers]

521
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,013
It's okay.

522
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:51,049
They say the early bird sits on the worm.

523
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:54,319
-[Meicoomon] Uh, they do? -[Meiko] Hold on.

524
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:57,055
You wanna make uniforms like the ones they showed in class,

525
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,790
-don't you? -Yeah.

526
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:01,726
-Of course! -[paper rustles]

527
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,731
So something that... looks like this?

528
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,000
[Mimi] Perfect! You're a genius!

529
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:12,203
Oh. And not one of those boring math geniuses!

530
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:16,174
-A fashion genius! -Meiko, me too. Hug, hug!

531
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:19,044
-Me too! -[helicopter whirring]

532

[phone beeps]

533
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,053
It's from Izzy.

534
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,921
\"An infected Digimon\"?

535
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:32,891
-So, what now? -It's close.

536
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,126
-Come on! Come on! -Okay.

537
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,761
Uh, let's go.

538
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,766
-Are you coming? -Can I bring my French fries

539
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,036
-with me? -Come on! No time!

540
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,071
All right.

541
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,875
I just saw the text. I'm on my way.

542
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,043
[Izzy] I'll leave it to you.

543
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:54,279
Agumon's in the server waiting for orders.

544
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:57,282
Find a monitor nearby that you can use.

545
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:00,185
[Izzy] Joe! Tai, Mimi, and Meiko are all on their way

546
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:01,987
to fix the infected Digimon.

547
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,054
Hmm.

548
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:08,827
[grunts]

549
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,464
[reporter] Eyewitnesses we've spoken to reveal that

550
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,699
large unidentified creatures just appeared

551
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,368
out of a distortion in the sky.

552
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,837
The police have cordoned off the entire area.

553
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,239
[first woman] This is awful. Why does all of this bad stuff

554
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,441
-keep happening, anyway? -[second woman] I don't know.

555
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,277
-But it's frightening. -[Biyomon] Mimi!

556
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,080
It'll be fine! [gasps]

557
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:31,983
-[growls] -[Meiko] What was that?

558
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,385
[Mimi] What we're here for.

559
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:38,223

-Ogremon. -[roars]

564
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,950
He's been infected.

-You okay? -I'm fine.

573
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,256
-Nice one. Thanks, Mei. -Yeah, thanks.

574
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,892
-Thank you. -[roaring continues]

575

-Oh, Izzy! It's Ogremon! -[Izzy] Yes, I know.

576
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,935
I saw from the video feed. Just stay put.

577
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:58,403
Tai is on the way with backup.

578
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:01,940
-Do what? Stay put? Oh! -[helicopter whirring]

579
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,112
-We've got this. -Huh?

580
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:08,947
-[Izzy] What do you mean? -Gotta go.

581
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,349
Mimi, are we gonna fight Ogremon?

582
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:14,853
No, just keep him under control.

583
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:17,288
He's infected, but he's still our Ogremon, right?

584
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,424
-That's right. -But Mimi...

585
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:21,426
Izzy said, \"Stay put.\"

586
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:24,162
No, we'll be okay. Better even.

587
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:27,365
I know a lot of people must be watching the news right now.

588
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:29,367
-Huh? -It's our chance to prove that

589
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,269
there are good Digimon, too.

590
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:34,139

-the infected Digimon. -[Joe] Yeah, I heard.

605
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:57,222
I told him that you were at your test prep class.

But since you're on your bike, you can get

to the scene quickly and I'll be right behind you!

00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,538
-[Meiko] I'm sorry. -Look, that helicopter just got

644
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:31,342
-too close. It's not your fault. -He's right, Mei Mei.

645
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,411
It's my fault. I gave the order.

646
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,113
[Izzy] I told you to wait for backup.

647
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:38,483
Listen, I'm tired of people saying \"Digimon are bad\"!

648
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,786
-I mean, aren't you? -Well, yeah, but--

649
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:44,188
[Izzy] Mimi, I know your heart was in the right place.

650
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:45,790
But because you acted on your own,

651
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:48,459
we're all in a really precarious predicament now.

652
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,762
Sometimes, Mimi, you don't think!

653
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:51,729
You just act.

654
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,533
Remember, you're not the only one in the group.

655
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:03,174
-Mimi. -That was rude.

656
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:08,212
Leave me alone.

657
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,284
Mimi? Mimi! Wait, please!

658
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:15,353
Let her go. She needs some time.

659
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:21,225
-What happened to Joe? -Well, I sent him a text, but...

660
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:24,162
-He didn't answer me either. -With everything that's been

661
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:26,464
going on lately, how can he really think

662
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:28,499
-studying's more important-- -Come on, Matt.

663
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:31,402
Look. Joe was always cautious. But he always knew

664
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:33,905
what mattered. He knew that sometimes

665
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,840
you have to do things you don't want to because

666
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:38,643
they are important. But now--

667
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:40,645
-Enough! -[groans]

668
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,250
[Tai] I'm sure he knew he needed to come. He just couldn't.

669
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:48,786
I'm sure that... he had his reasons.

670
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,291
[Matt] Yeah! I'll bet.

671
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,527
Hey, Joe. Listen.

672
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,396
I really think we should've gone.

673
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,164
Everyone else did.

674
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:02,433
I know what would've happened if we went.

675
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:05,736
Someone would be angry with me

676
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,739
for not being more involved. And then someone else

677
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:12,276
would defend me. And no matter what I said,

678
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,879
I wouldn't be able to stop another pointless argument.

679
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:23,888
-[engine hums] -[static]

680
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:31,863
The attack that creature unleashed

681
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,699
brought our helicopter crashing to the ground.

682
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,267
It was terrifying.

683
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:38,870
[beep]

684
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:41,939
Mimi.

685
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:48,813
[father] What a mess, huh?

686
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:52,550
Yeah, it even forced Joe's School to close

687
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:53,417
for a while.

688
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:55,620
How is he, anyway? He seems stressed.

689
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,855
Hmm, he's been studying non-stop.

690
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:01,392
[father] I want him to do well but... man!

691
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,866
Oh. Thank you very much.

692
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,670
It's the least I can do. And the most I will do.

693
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:15,940
[Palmon] You guys tried. You should be proud.

694
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:17,341
[chuckles]

695
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:21,479
-Check out our HQ. -[Sora] Tai?

696
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:26,684
-Oh! No way! -Leomon?

697
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,319
He's got something, to tell us.

698
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:33,758
Something strange is happening in the Digital World.

699
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:38,462
So, I've come here to alert you. We first noticed

700
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:41,032
when Ogremon started acting oddly.

701
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:44,835
We don't understand what's causing these mutations.

702
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,771
But he's not the only one.

703
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:50,575
Precisely, we've been calling them infected Digimon.

704
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:53,878
Do you think that the Digital World's mutations

705
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:56,380
and the electrical distortions that connect out worlds

706
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:57,648
are related?

707
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:01,052
[Leomon] I do believe that there is a connection.

708
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:03,988
I was trying to keep a close eye on Ogremon.

709
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:05,856
But I was just too late.

710
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,759
Well, how is it you're not infected?

711
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:11,629
I'm not sure. Although...

712
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:14,865
I remember when Ogremon became sick.

713
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,868
It was like something inside him short-circuited.

714
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:18,970
He went haywire.

715
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:22,873
I have a question for you, Leomon.

716
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,409
Which appeared first in the Digital World?

717
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,845
Was it the electrical distortions,

718
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:29,914
or was it the infected Digimon?

719
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:31,682
[Leomon] The infected came first.

720
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:37,321
Then that means I'd assumed wrong. I thought the distortions

721
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:41,826
had come first. Maybe, something like bad data's

722
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:45,863
corrupting the Digimon. Or else, some sort of program

723
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:48,399
containing a virus or another creature

724
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:51,702
of some kind. It may be that the distortions

725
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:54,405
are actually side effects of the infection.

726
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,641
Me being scared is a side effect.

727
00:37:56,674 --> 00:38:00,878
-What if we get infected? -Should we get some bug spray?

728
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:03,881
-But bug spray bugs me. -What about sunblock?

729
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:06,417
Yeah! And some doctor's masks?

730
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,854
-Now, we're ready! -Don't worry, guys.

731
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:13,357
You'll be fine, as long as you stay inside the server.

732
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:16,694
It's isolated behind a seriously robust firewall.

733
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:20,998
I designed its threefold, security-check system myself.

734
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,834
No one can get in unless I authenticate them.

735
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:29,473
If the infection started... Huh.

736
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:30,675
Did something ring a bell?

-Ouch. -Be careful.

00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:23,961
There's a ton of sharp objects around here.

750

I know. I have some experience

-sewing in this room. -Well, we're trying to,

752
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,002
at least. Where's Mimi?

-What? -You never asked.

759
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:55,493
You just decided on your own.

Well, we're not gonna put up with it.

-You narcissist. -Narcissist?

Don't know that one? It's someone

763
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,635
really self-centered and annoying.

some other scraps, there's a ton more in the back.

-Mimi. -So how did the meeting go?

770
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:32,196
Just look! Sora did a great job putting this together.

771
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:33,697
I might even wear it.

772
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:36,700
Sorry, but the uniform has to change.

773

-[Meiko] Huh? -[Sora] What?

774
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:41,105
But you asked us to work on them.

775
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:44,608
What's wrong? Did something happen?

776
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:47,211
-Of course not. -But we already--

777

-Look! Just forget it! -[gasps]

[Sora] Wait!

780
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:15,206
Joe? What's he doing?

00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,878
[water lapping]

782
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:24,248
You playing hooky or something?

783
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,085
Can you really afford to do that

784
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:30,120
with your tests coming up?

785
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,790
What about you? I thought I saw a text

786
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,025
about you being busy planning the school festival.

787
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,165
[Kari] Huh?

788
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:45,169
It's Mimi. And she's with Joe.

789
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:49,740
[Mimi] Do you think I'm a narcissist?

790
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:55,012
-Wha... Oh, uh. -Didn't sound like a no.

791
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,815
-Sorry. -It's okay.

792
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,018
I guess I always thought I might be a bit self-centered,

793
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:04,255
deep down. These last few days have really

794
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:04,989
made it obvious.

795
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:09,593
Painfully obvious. It's just that when

796
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:12,296
I get excited about something, I jump right in and follow

797
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,098
my gut instincts.

798
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:17,668
Then I assume it's what everyone else wants, too.

799
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,905
But sometimes I don't see that it might actually affect

800
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:25,809
the people around me. I mean, I got poor Palmon hurt.

801
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,313
I even lost my temper with Mei Mei.

802
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:34,218
Sometimes, I just get so sick and tired

803
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:38,122
-of the way I am. -[Joe] You might be

804
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:41,325
self-centered, but at least you're doing something.

805
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:44,228
-Huh? -[Joe] I feel disgusted

806
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:47,164
with myself because I'm such a coward.

807
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:47,831
[Mimi] Joe!

808
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:52,903
Why do we always have to take care of things?

809
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:54,772
Because we're the Digidestined?

810
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,342
Why do we have to drop everything?

811
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:01,979
That again, really? After all we've been through?

812
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:04,682
I thought it was over. But it keeps coming back

813
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:07,284
like a bad dream. How long are we supposed to be

814
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:10,054
-the Digidestined? -Oh.

815
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,990
[rain pattering]

816
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:21,332
[Joe] This is a big turning point in my life.

817
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:24,168
I want to grow up, contribute to society,

818
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:25,903
figure out how I'm supposed to fit into it,

819
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,739
without always worrying about being one

820
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:29,974
of the Digidestined.

821
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:35,312
I don't want to be selfish. But I want my life

822
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:36,680
to actually be mine.

823
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,684
That's why I've been hitting the books so hard.

824
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:43,454
Is that why you're playing hooky?

825
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:47,858
[Joe] Yeah, okay. You got me there.

826
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:50,060
-Joe, hold on. -Being self-centered...

827
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:52,963
-is better than being a coward.

828
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:57,368
Oh...

829
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:09,380
Using growing up as an excuse.

830
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:10,247
[sniffs]

831
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,349
It's just pathetic.

832
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:17,287
[sobs]

833
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:24,762
-[rain pattering] -[cars whooshing]

834
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:30,334
[Kari] I saw a whole other side of you, Tai.

835
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,736
-What do you mean? -What you said...

836
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:33,837
Huh?

837
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:36,073
That Joe wanted to come, but couldn't.

838
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:38,308
Hmm?

839
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:43,514
I think Joe is still trying to figure things out.

840
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:45,382
So why don't you go and talk to him?

841
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:48,152
-Just let it go. -Uh-uh.

842
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,253
But, Tai--

843
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:52,356
It's clear there are things he doesn't wanna face.

844
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:55,359
You really think that includes being one of us?

845
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:58,495
-One of the Digidestined? -[Tai] Look, if I talk to him,

846
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,897
he'll have to face it.

847
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,832
And that might drive him further away.

848
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,935
[Kari] And you? Is there something

849
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:06,070
you're hiding from?

850
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,309
Is that... why you're avoiding Matt?

851
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:13,343
[sighs deeply]

852
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:16,380
Isn't it past your bedtime?

853
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:20,084
[rain pouring]

854
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:29,359
[drawer opens]

855

[sobs]

856
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:41,004
-[Gomamon] Joe! -Yeah, what is it?

857
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:45,142
I made you a midnight snack. And I even added an egg.

858
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:47,444
-You're so good to me. -I'm here for you.

859
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:50,514
Whatever you need. You need food, I'll get it.

860
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:52,816
You need a pencil, I'll get it. You need sleep...

861
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,551
Well, you might have to help with that one.

862
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,153
-Gomamon! -Hmm?

863
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:03,260
I'm sorry.

864
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,095
Huh?

865
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:08,332
-[cries quietly] -[sighs]

866
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:14,338
Oh, Joe, don't let the food get cold.

867
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:16,840
[crying quietly]

868

[grunting]

[horn blows at a distance]

870
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:34,825
[grunts] Huh?

871
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:37,828
Gomamon?

872
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:40,464
[sighs]

873
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,574
It's from Gomamon.

874
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:53,477
\"Thanks for everything\"?

875
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,245
What's that supposed to mean?

876
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:01,151
[Tentomon] You could stay here! Although, we'd have to find

877
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:03,120
something to do with all this delicious food

878
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,321
to make room.

879
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:07,291
-Uh, can you handle that? -Um... I'll try.

880
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,993
I'll ask Izzy, but I'm sure it'll be no sweat.

881
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:11,428
'Cause I can't sweat. [chuckles]

882
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:14,398
Plus, we can use a helping hand. Uh, helping claw.

883
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:17,935
Someone to make snacks and so forth, mostly snacks.

884
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:20,504
-We have enough so forth. -Great! Count me in.

885
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:22,039
-[chuckles] -[both] Huh?

886
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:24,408
-What's his deal? -Izzy, why are you running?

887
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:27,144
I just said there'd be no sweat.

888
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,913
Something urgent's come up. I have to investigate.

889
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:30,981
Lay it on me, sister.

890
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:34,084
I got an email last night from an unknown sender.

891
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:36,920
So, I figured it was just some kind of spam.

892
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:39,623
I scanned it just in case, and didn't find a virus.

893
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:43,060
-But I did find something else. -That's Digicode.

894
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:44,461
Yeah. But why?

895
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:47,497
[Izzy] It shares a source with the Digital World's code.

896
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,434
The universe has two sides, like a coin.

897
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:53,303
Those who crave true power must seek the darkness,

898
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:54,338
but move past it.

899
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:57,274
-[Tentomon] Is it a prank? -Well, it could be.

900
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:59,109
But we still have to confirm that

901
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:02,079
and figure out who would've done it.

902
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:03,447
[both groan]

903
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:10,187
[buzzes]

904
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:14,157
[Himekawa] Yes, the Digimon you're concerned about

905
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,994
is being watched over by its human partner.

906
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:20,464
But still, someone could always try to take advantage

907
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,299
of the situation.

908
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:23,934
We can't be too careful.

909
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:29,673
Right.

910
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:33,443
[Nishijima] Agent Himekawa. Here's the debriefing

911
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:37,180
on the data concerning the latest digital distortions.

912
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:39,249
We think we can predict the locations

913
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:42,052
where they'll occur and we'll need more security.

914
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:45,689
Understood, we'll increase security in those areas.

915
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:48,025
Especially the more populated ones.

916
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:49,092
Right. But...

917
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:53,330
Unfortunately, there's a school festival tomorrow.

918
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:54,398

[indistinct chatter]

921
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:14,117
[Nishi] We've increased security and put everyone on high alert.

922
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,720
They have permission to evacuate the area, if needed.

923
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:19,189
-And the students? -How could I break the news

924
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:20,324
to them?

925
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:23,026
Today is supposed to be a fun day.

926
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:26,196
Look, their digital partners second and kids first.

927

-Mimi! -Oh!

930
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:45,549
-Good! You're here. -Mei Mei, your outfit!

931
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:48,051
Well, since they were already done and everything,

932
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:49,219
I thought...

933
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:52,289
-Yeah. Sure thing. -I just...

934
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,256
-wanted. -[gasps]

935
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:57,761
We talked about designs and came up with this.

936
00:49:57,794 --> 00:50:01,331
Well, I mean, really it was you who came up with it.

937
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:03,767
And Sora was the one who actually put it together.

938
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,736
But just like you said...

939
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:08,705
It made me feel happy.

940
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:08,805
[Mimi] Oh!

941
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:14,177
I thought about how your cafe could make everyone happy.

942
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:17,414
And how I could help out by wearing this. And so...

943
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:18,648
Mei Mei!

944
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:26,623
-Thank you. -[grunts] Mimi!

945
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:29,459
I just knew that you'd look great in this.

946
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:32,095
Maybe I should have worn it myself.

947
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:34,564
Um, well, guess what?

[giggles]

953
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,618
No way! Fashion demands courage.

954
00:50:57,487 --> 00:51:00,323
[Izzy] Those who crave true power must seek

955
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:03,193
the darkness, but move past it.

956
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:06,129
Seek the darkness, but move past it...

957
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:07,397
What does that mean?

958
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:08,765
[Tentomon] Slow down!

959
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:10,634
Don't eat the couch cushions too!

960
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:12,436
[Gabumon] Why? Did they go bad?

961
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:15,272
Palmon, glad you're feeling better.

962
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:17,340
Not as glad as I am.

963
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:20,677
Here, you deserve it. Go nuts on these donuts.

964
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:23,580
-Thanks, I will. -And these too.

965
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:24,848
If I have to.

966
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:29,486
-I'm so glad you're my friends. -We really are pretty cool.

967
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:32,189
You know? You did great against Ogremon.

968
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:35,559
-Yeah, you were really brave. -Snack reward.

969
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:38,462
You know... You could have couch cushions.

970
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:40,197
You guys are the best!

971
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,364
[Tentomon] Want something, Leomon?

972
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:44,301
Or... just sit there looking intimidating. That's fine.

973
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:45,469
Hmm.

974
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:46,770
-[phone buzzes] -Uh...

975
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:51,208
Joe wants to know where Gomamon is.

976
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:52,943
-Gomamon. -What happened?

977
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:55,879
Uh, Joe's asking everybody about where you are.

978
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:57,547
Oh, yeah, right.

979
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:59,216
Did you tell him where you were going?

980
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:00,183
No.

981
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:02,319
Okay then. I'll tell him that you're here.

982
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:04,421
No! Wait! Don't!

983
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,756
But he might be worried, Gomamon.

984
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:07,991
Please, don't.

985
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:11,528
[Izzy] Okay, that's enough staring, guys. I got the point.

986
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:14,564
Then here's some talking. Gomamon has his reasons.

987
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:15,832
Can't we let him stay?

988
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:17,767
And can't we get some jelly donuts?

989
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,203
What did jelly donuts ever do to you?

990
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:21,838
All right. Donuts.

991
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:25,442
You okay, Gomamon?

992
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:27,878
[groans]

993
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:31,848
[Joe] He's not with Kari. Huh...

994
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:35,252
Matt hasn't seen him either. And neither has Izzy.

995
00:52:37,387 --> 00:52:38,522
[sighs]

996
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,492
So where could he be?

997
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,796
[crowd chattering]

998
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:49,900
[Meiko] I can't! I just can't!

999
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:52,836
-Don't make me do it. -Oh, come on!

1000
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:55,472
You want to make everyone happy, don't you?

1001
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,607
-[shrieks] -We're open.

1002
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:05,515
[chuckles]

1003
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:08,251
Welcome, everyone.

1004
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:11,521
[indistinct chatter]

1005
00:53:11,555 --> 00:53:14,024
Come on! You gotta welcome everyone.

1006
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:17,460
[whimpers, sneezes]

1007
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:20,564
[laughs]

1008
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:24,668
-That's one way to do it. -I told you I can't.

1009
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,604
Yet somehow, you will. Welcome guys!

1010
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,008
-Want some Yakisoba? -No thanks.

1011
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,377
-They have crepes. -I'm good.

1012
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:36,913
Check it out, I made that sign over by the game.

1013
00:53:36,947 --> 00:53:38,448
-Should I care? -Uh...

1014
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:42,886
I always thought school festivals were super lame.

1015
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:45,622
You said that in high school, too.

1016
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:47,023
Although, you know...

1017
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,826
Back in grade school, you couldn't get enough of them.

1018
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:51,861
Yeah, well, we can't stay kids forever.

1019
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:57,834
That's what I've learned. I used to think a lot as a kid.

1020
00:53:57,867 --> 00:54:00,904
But I never found the big answers I was after.

1021
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:03,573
No matter how much thinking I did.

1022
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:06,343
High school wasn't an easy time for me.

1023
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:13,750
[gasps]

1024
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:20,924
So, you had some growing pains. Everyone does.

1025
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:24,461
But you were never childish, Himekawa.

1026
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:26,463
[indistinct chatter]

1027
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:36,840
Is that Ken?

1028
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:45,348
Is something wrong?

1029
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,021
[girl] Breakfast is served.

1030
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:58,862
-Afternoon. Two, please. -Come on in.

1031
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:02,365
-Mei Mei! -Oh!

1032
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,934
[nervously] I'll show you to your table now.

1033
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:08,138
[giggles]

1034
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:10,740
-Sorry. -Don't let her fool ya.

1035
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:13,543
Her shy attitude is earning her a whole lot of fans.

1036
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:14,811
[groaning] Stop, Mimi!

1037
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:21,151
-Where's Meicoomon? -Oh, he's over at Izzy's

1038
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:23,920
-with all the other Digimon. -Oh.

1039
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:25,989
The Digimon are there by themselves?

1040
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:29,592
-No. Izzy's there, too. -So, then he didn't come,

1041
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:31,795
-either? -Well, he's busy

1042
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,730
-with some research. -Even though

1043
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:34,964
it's the big festival?

1044
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,536
-It's here! -What?

1045
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:42,672
-What is? -It's show time!

1046
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:45,175
-Let's go. -No way.

1047
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:48,078
I told you, I can't. Don't make me do it.

1048
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:49,813
[Mimi chuckles] That's what everyone says!

1049
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,414
Come on! Just try.

1050
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:53,583
[cheerleading music]

1051
00:55:57,053 --> 00:55:59,055
[onlookers clapping]

1052
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:06,996
Those two are incredible.

1053
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:17,140
-Yeah! Yeah! -No, no, no!

1054
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:20,210
-[Mimi] Yeah! -[Meiko] Achoo!

1055
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:23,646
-They make a good team. -[chuckling]

1056
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,415
[Nishijima] I wish Izzy could see this.

1057
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:32,756
[phone buzzes]

1058
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:38,161
Agent Himekawa? Emergency?

1059
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,499
[shrieks]

1060
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:45,001
What's up? Did that Nigerian Prince finally

1061
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:48,238
write you back? Wowza!

1062
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:50,940
I think I just learned how to sweat.

1063
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:52,542
[phone rings]

1064
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:58,548
Oh! Hey, look! Izzy is coming.

1065
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,851
Himekawa, what did you do?

1066
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:04,821
Just like you said. They're ordinary kids first

1067
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:06,923
and Digimon partner second.

1068
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:08,958
At least, for today they are.

1069
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:11,728
-Huh. -I guess I agreed with you.

1070
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:17,801
But what about Meicoomon and the other Digimon?

1071
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:20,537
-They'll hang at HQ. -Maybe, I should go

1072
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:22,806
-check on them. -Absolutely not.

1073
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:26,142
You're still a school employee. So stay put. I'll check on them.

1074
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:28,978
-Yes, Ma'am! -[chuckles]

1075
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:30,580
[indistinct chatter]

1076
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,284
[Agumon] The snacks are gone. And those couch cushions

1077
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:37,086
-don't look tasty. -Well, we could go

1078
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,023
-to the school festival. -I heard Matt's band is playing

1079
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:41,858
-there, too. -But there's no one

1080
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:43,960
-to take us. -[Tentomon] Actually, there is.

1081
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:45,962
Our main man here.

1082
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:48,565
I'd be \"lion\" if I said it wouldn't be fun.

1083
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:52,669
If he'd just set aside his \"pride\", it'd be \"pawsome\"!

1084
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:54,737
I can't believe he's not getting this.

1085
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:56,206
We have to be more obvious.

1086
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,777
-Leomon, you take us. -What? Me?

1087
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,078
-Come on, Leomon! -[indistinct chatter]

1088
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,047
Leomon, you just gotta take us.

1089
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,281
You just gotta!

1090
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,650
Actually, that's exactly what a...

1091
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:10,787
[indistinct chatter]

1092
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,990
We're all super hungry here, here, and everywhere!

1093
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:15,258
If you really wanna try...

1094
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:19,062
-What do you say? -[Meicoomon] Leomon...

1095
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:20,096
[grunts] What?

1096
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,835
[gasps]

1097
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:31,841
-Pretty please! -[screams] Fine!

[crowd cheers]

1099
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:46,923
Wow. I gotta say, they're actually

1100
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:48,091
sounding pretty good.

1101
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:52,662
-What's their name now, anyway? -The World on the Knife.

1102
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:53,796
Oh.

1103
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:06,910
Oh, Izzy. Hiya!

1104

[yelling]

1105
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:13,116
Well, that's quite the outfit you've got.

1106
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:15,618
Uh, is something wrong with it?

1107
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:19,822
Uh... nope. It's fine. Table for one?

1108
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:22,225
-For three, please. -Hmm?

1109
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:25,728
-[Izzy] Uh...TK, Kari! -Mind if we sit with you?

1110
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:28,998
-Uh, sure. -Welcome, guys. A three top!

1111
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:33,803
-Mei Mei, you're up. -Okay. On it. Right this way.

1112
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:36,172
-Who's that girl? -She's cute.

1113
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:38,675
Wow, Meiko. It looks great on you.

1114
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:40,777
What? I mean, thank you.

1115
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:43,079
-Now, say \"Cheese!\" -[whimpers]

-[sneezes] -[camera clicks]

1117
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:49,252
-Close enough. -TK! I think there's someone

1118
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:51,754
-you forgot to compliment. -Oh, who's that?

1119
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:53,856
The one who's about to feed you a tray!

1120
00:59:57,193 --> 01:00:01,197
All right. We've arrived. Just keep completely still.

1121
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:05,234
-Can I use my sniffing muscles? -I bet Mimi's cafe has food!

01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,070
Stay calm and behave.

1123
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:09,038
-Leomon? -[growls]

1124
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:11,941
Pretty please?

1125
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:14,344
[screams] Fine!

1126
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:17,380
-Yeah! You heard him. -Yay!

1127
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:20,183
[Leomon] Just stay where I can see you!

1128
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:23,720
[indistinct chatter]

1129
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:26,889
Where did they all go?

1130
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:31,661
[doorbell rings]

1131
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:38,167
[noodles sizzling]

1132
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:41,371
-That looks good. -So hungry.

1133
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:42,872
The food looks hungry?

1134
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:46,142
-Do you have any money? -Money tastes bad.

1135
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:48,711
[Tentomon] No, we need the money to buy the food.

1136
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:50,380
Now I'm hungry and sad.

1137
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:52,882
[man] The creepy and cute costume contest

1138
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:54,384
-is about to begin. -[all] Huh?

1139
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:56,352
The winner can pick whatever they want

1140
01:00:56,386 --> 01:01:00,390
from our food vendors for free. And they can even eat it, too.

1141
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:02,859
-For free? -But where are we going

1142
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:05,361
-to find costumes? -[all] Hmm...

1143
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:08,765
[all] Wait a minute!

1144
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:11,901
[announcer] Great costumes, huh folks?

1145
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:14,203
Uh, whatever they're supposed to be.

1146
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,806
Anyway, give them a nice round of applause!

1147
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:19,108
-[crowd applauds] -Wow, it's packed here.

1148
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:22,278
[announcer] Up next... Am I saying this right?

1149
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:25,314
-Gomaching! -I am Gomaching!

1150
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,884
-[crowd cheers] -But that's Gomamon!

1151
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:31,754
Up next, cuter than the cutest button I've ever buttoned...

1152
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:34,123
-Meicoo! -I'm Meicoo!

1153
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:36,426
[boy] Yeah! Check it out!

1154
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:38,761
[onlookers chattering]

1155
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:49,172
-[groans and pants] -[phone buzzes]

1156
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:52,141
[exhales]

1157
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:54,077
Gomamon's at the school?

1158
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:55,445
[footsteps receding]

1159
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:02,085
Matt. Good! Agumon is here.

1160
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:05,188
-And the other Digimon, too. -They're all here?

1161
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:06,923
They all entered the creepy and cute

1162
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:10,193
costume contest. Look, I have a soccer game now.

1163
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:12,862
Can you maybe keep an eye on them?

1164
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:16,032
Sure thing. You still haven't given me

1165
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:17,834
-an answer. -Huh?

1166
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:20,103
Why'd Omnimon's Digivolve fail?

1167
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:21,270
What?

1168
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:29,178
Isn't it bad enough Alphamon... got beat?

1169
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:33,216
-[groaning] -I don't care what happened.

1170
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:34,450
I wanna know why.

1171
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:41,157
Back when it was just us.

1172
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:42,792
You had doubts.

1173
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,795
And that's why it failed, right?

1174
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,535
Hey, Tai!

1175
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:01,277
-[wheels squeak] -[footsteps receding]

1176
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:03,546
Well, this is it! The moment of truth

1177
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:06,883
has finally arrived. Time to announce

1178
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:08,317
the winner of the costume contest.

1179
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:10,153
You guys! Are our Digimon really here?

1180
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:13,256
-Yeah, somewhere. -[gasps] Right there!

1181
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:16,092
-The winner is... -[drum roll]

1182
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,960
Meicoo!

1183
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:21,631
-[crowd cheering] -Not Gabumon?

1184
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:25,034
Give her a big round of applause!

1185
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:26,836
[applause]

1186
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:32,508
-I am so happy. -[all] And you're just too cute!

1187
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:35,545
Palmon, you were supposed to be taking a nap!

1188
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:37,980
Yeah, but naps are hard to eat.

1189
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:40,883
-You were so cute up there. -And here.

1190
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:44,220
Come on. It's eating time. It always is.

1191
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:46,322
That's right. Meicoomon just won

1192
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:48,891
-a bunch of free food. -Listen you guys.

1193
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:51,994
That stunt you pulled was a seriously risky move.

1194
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:54,096
What if you had been recognized?

1195
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:57,066
Worth it! They might have given us more food!

1196
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:58,100
[groans]

1197
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:02,305
Gomamon! [panting]

1198
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:08,544
Joe.

1199
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,348
[Joe] I don't get it.

1200
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:15,184
Why'd you leave without saying anything?

1201
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:18,521
Talk to me. Were you unhappy or something?

1202
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:21,123
-[Gomamon] It's not that. -Then, what is it?

1203
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:22,959
There has to be a reason you left.

1204
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:25,061
[Gomamon] You didn't want me there.

1205
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:28,931
I never said that... ever.

1206
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:31,500
You didn't need to. Everything you did sent

1207
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:34,637
-that message loud and clear. -Are you mad at me?

1208
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:37,039
-No. -Then what's wrong?

1209
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:39,308
Stop playing around and just tell me the truth.

1210
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:41,944
You're the one who's not telling the truth.

1211
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:44,113
-I am? -Look. Just say it.

1212
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:46,916
You don't want us to work together anymore, do you?

1213
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:52,722
This is a big burden to you and I just get in your way.

1214
01:04:52,755 --> 01:04:54,423
Well, it is kind of a burden.

1215
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:56,125
-But-- -Thought so.

1216
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:58,728
-But you're not a burden. -Huh?

1217
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:01,664
It's this whole being one of the Digidestined thing.

1218
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:05,501
Why is it always gotta be us? Why do we have to fight?

1219
01:05:05,534 --> 01:05:07,970
It's because that's who you are, Joe.

1220
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:10,606
But why? If there's a battle,

1221
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,010
it should be fought by people who want to be soldiers!

1222
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:16,279
You really think that I like to fight?

1223
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:19,215
That's not the point. But fighting is the last thing

1224
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:22,451
-I should be concentrating on. -I know. And that's why

1225
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:24,987
you don't want me around anymore, because you don't

1226
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:29,692
have to fight if I'm not there. But this is my destiny.

1227
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:31,193
I'm not running away.

1228
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:34,664
So, that's what you think I've been doing?

1229
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:36,999
But you just can't come out, and say it, can you?

1230
01:05:39,335 --> 01:05:40,169
[groans]

1231
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:41,737
Do what you want!

1232
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:45,741
Fine! I'll stay away!

1233
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:51,280
I'll just leave you alone. [sniffles]

1234
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:01,090
[girls chattering]

1235
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:02,992
-Meiko! -[gasps]

1236
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,561
Mei! Shh!

1237
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:08,264
-Please keep it down. -I want dessert.

1238
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:11,200
I bet Agumon's eating dessert right now.

1239
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:13,302
Sorry, just a bit longer.

1240
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:17,239
-But I wait better with dessert! -[laughing]

1241
01:06:18,841 --> 01:06:21,711
-Mei Mei! Showtime! -[whimpers]

1242
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:23,713
I'm too tired. I'm too busy. Whatever it takes

1243
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:26,349
-not to do it. -Our dessert's deserting us.

1244
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:28,150
Oh wait! Come back.

1245
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:33,289
[sighs] Okay. All right. I'll handle it. Let's go.

1246
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:37,326
We're waiting here? So we can wait some more? Hmm!

1247
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:42,198
[sighs] No pie, goodbye.

1248
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:44,633
Huh?

1249
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:48,337
Hi!

1250
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:51,273
[thud]

1251
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:54,810
-[players cheer] -Yes! [chuckles]

1252
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:59,315
-Go, Tai! Nice one. -[applause]

1253
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:02,585
Was that Joe?

1254
01:07:02,618 --> 01:07:04,453
[breathes heavily]

1255
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:06,856
Where are you going? Where's Gomamon?

1256
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:09,125
-[Joe] I'm going home. -What?

1257
01:07:09,158 --> 01:07:10,326
I gotta study.

1258
01:07:14,397 --> 01:07:19,201
I just don't get it. Why does it always have to be me?

1259
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:19,802
Why? Huh?

1260
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:23,105
Why does this stuff always happen to me?

1261
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:31,447
Tell you what. You stay here, and I'll get you a snack.

1262
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,449
-You want a crepe? -Okay.

1263
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:36,452
[chuckles]

1264
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:44,427
What? Meicoomon's gone?

1265
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:45,461
Oh, no.

1266
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:48,431
[people chatter]

1267
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:50,099

1268
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,669
[giggles]

1269
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,281
Huh?

1270
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:10,820
A new distortion's been spotted?

1271
01:08:30,973 --> 01:08:32,374
Thank you very much.

1272
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:37,613
-Hey. -What's the matter?

1273
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:40,182
There's a distortion behind the school.

1274
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:42,485
[Himekawa] Damn it! Let's go!

1275
01:08:43,752 --> 01:08:46,789
This is bad. I messed up.

1276
01:08:46,822 --> 01:08:49,658
I let my guard down and I left Meicoomon alone.

1277
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:51,293
What? Meicoomon?

1278
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:00,369
[heavy breathing]

1279
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:08,777

01:22:30,378 --> 01:22:32,580
[cries] Come back!

1446
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:38,086
[Nishijima] You're okay with leaving it like this?

1447
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:39,621
[Himekawa] The distortion closed.

1448
01:22:39,654 --> 01:22:41,289
There's nothing we can do.

1449
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:45,560
-Except plan our next move. -Why did this have to happen?

1450
01:22:45,593 --> 01:22:48,596
[Himekawa] The distortions, the infected Digimon,

1451
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:52,100
all of it happened... for the same reason.

1452
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:54,703
Meicoomon!
