WEBVTT

00:00:36.288 --> 00:00:41.398
[Marulk] I... I find it hard
to say this, but if you guys

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:44.371
come back and say that it's
impossible and you're not going,

00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:46.208
it's okay.

00:00:46.308 --> 00:00:48.279
Oh, Marulk.

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:49.314
[crying]

00:00:49.414 --> 00:00:50.784
Yeah, I know.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.888
It's just that I've watched
so many people leave us

00:00:52.988 --> 00:00:54.758
and never come back again.

00:00:54.858 --> 00:00:58.266
And now today is the
saddest I've ever felt.

00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:01.205
[crying]

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.647
[music playing]

00:01:15.767 --> 00:01:17.571
[Reg] The Inverted Forest.

00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:19.741
It's so far above us.

00:01:20.376 --> 00:01:21.178
Reg.

00:01:21.278 --> 00:01:22.347
Huh?

00:01:27.257 --> 00:01:28.726
Are you ready to do this?

00:01:28.826 --> 00:01:30.230
Yes, of course.

00:01:35.974 --> 00:01:38.112
[Narrator] <i>As if</i>
<i>helplessly drawn to it,</i>

00:01:38.212 --> 00:01:41.952
<i>there are those who plunge</i>
<i>themselves into the darkness.</i>

00:01:42.053 --> 00:01:45.927
<i>They do it because at the</i>
<i>bottom of all that emptiness,</i>

00:01:46.027 --> 00:01:48.733
<i>they can sense</i>
<i>a glowing enigma.</i>

00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:51.105
<i>They have been</i>
<i>enchanted by a mystery</i>

00:01:51.205 --> 00:01:53.509
<i>more dazzling than</i>
<i>light itself.</i>

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:57.584
<i>They traverse the unknown,</i>
<i>search for the truth,</i>

00:01:57.684 --> 00:02:00.823
<i>and in the far</i>
<i>reaches of the world,</i>

00:02:00.924 --> 00:02:03.362
<i>after exhausting their lives,</i>

00:02:03.462 --> 00:02:05.934
<i>they reach their mortal end.</i>

00:02:06.034 --> 00:02:10.210
<i>There they become a new</i>
<i>darkness, a new enigma,</i>

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.885
<i>and are thus reborn as the</i>
<i>very depths themselves.</i>

00:02:14.985 --> 00:02:16.989
<i>It is a birth unlike any other,</i>

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.267
<i>one overflowing with both</i>
<i>Curses and Blessings.</i>

00:02:27.878 --> 00:02:31.085
[bell clanging]

00:02:33.256 --> 00:02:34.625
Hey, Shiggy.

00:02:34.725 --> 00:02:37.197
I wonder where Riko
and Reg are right now.

00:02:37.297 --> 00:02:39.368
I bet they're somewhere
around the Great Fault.

00:02:39.468 --> 00:02:40.536
Huh?

00:02:40.637 --> 00:02:42.006
And how do you figure that?

00:02:42.107 --> 00:02:44.745
A calculation I based on
the number of days it's been

00:02:44.845 --> 00:02:46.649
and Reg's abilities.

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:48.319
The Rough Map of
the Nether World?

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:49.755
That's right.

00:02:49.855 --> 00:02:52.460
I made a copy of it back
when I borrowed it earlier.

00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:54.898
So the Great Fault.
"A vertical wall

00:02:54.998 --> 00:02:57.237
spanning more
than 4,000 meters."

00:02:57.337 --> 00:02:59.708
From that point on,
the strain of ascending

00:02:59.808 --> 00:03:02.514
becomes more severe and
people start hallucinating.

00:03:02.614 --> 00:03:04.851
That looks like
it's straight down.

00:03:04.952 --> 00:03:07.424
How are they ever
going to scale that?

00:03:07.524 --> 00:03:12.300
I don't exactly know, but, well,
Reg was able to climb up it,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.773
so there must be some
kind of route somewhere.

00:03:15.873 --> 00:03:19.147
[wind howling]

00:03:23.956 --> 00:03:26.362
[chittering]

00:03:29.534 --> 00:03:31.372
[crash]

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.976
[Reg] Another exit hole.

00:03:38.953 --> 00:03:41.525
[roaring]

00:03:44.131 --> 00:03:46.435
Look there!
It's a madokajack!

00:03:46.535 --> 00:03:49.875
Riko. Keep your head in.

00:03:49.975 --> 00:03:52.247
[Reg] What do you
think we should do?

00:03:52.347 --> 00:03:55.620
Our only option is to descend
or brace for the Curse's effect

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.822
and head back.

00:03:56.922 --> 00:04:00.129
Um. Do you see any
other holes nearby?

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:01.498
Oh.

00:04:01.598 --> 00:04:02.968
How about that one?

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.440
The spot with the critter
droppings sticking out.

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:10.416
Riko. All right, do it now.

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:11.952
Okay.

00:04:13.622 --> 00:04:14.891
I'm sorry.

00:04:14.992 --> 00:04:17.597
I would have rather made
a yummy meal out of you.

00:04:17.697 --> 00:04:19.434
See you.

00:04:19.534 --> 00:04:21.205
[roaring]

00:04:22.273 --> 00:04:24.010

00:04:24.111 --> 00:04:25.813

00:04:25.913 --> 00:04:28.085
<i>beings such as you and I</i>

<i>that gets picked off and eaten.</i>

00:04:29.988 --> 00:04:31.492
The weaker species
have no choice

00:04:31.592 --> 00:04:34.464
but to choose the
path of the weak.

00:04:36.468 --> 00:04:39.107
All right.
Hurry and get further inside.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.051
[distant roaring]

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:50.663
-What was that?
-Reg!

00:04:50.763 --> 00:04:52.434
-Huh?
-We totally did it.

00:04:52.534 --> 00:04:55.940
Look at that.
This den goes further down.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.677
Quick. Let's go!

00:04:57.777 --> 00:05:00.015
Okay. I'm coming.

00:05:02.887 --> 00:05:04.758
<i>That sound.</i>

00:05:04.858 --> 00:05:06.929
<i>Something about it bothers me.</i>

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:08.833
[chittering]

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:10.703
[Riko] We've gone down
quite a ways.

00:05:10.803 --> 00:05:12.307
I feel bad though.

00:05:12.407 --> 00:05:14.745
I know it was all for the
sake of pushing forward,

00:05:14.845 --> 00:05:16.415
but we totally
trashed their home.

00:05:16.515 --> 00:05:18.519
We should be grateful to
these little fur balls here.

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:19.554
They're a big help.

00:05:19.654 --> 00:05:20.957
[Reg] Yeah.

00:05:21.058 --> 00:05:23.027
Thanks to them, we haven't
had any trouble looking

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:25.633
for food or a place to sleep.

00:05:26.835 --> 00:05:28.105
Oh.

00:05:29.841 --> 00:05:32.947
[chittering]

00:05:37.022 --> 00:05:40.396
[Reg] So, are these
some kind of ruins?

00:05:43.402 --> 00:05:44.971
Hey, Reg.

00:05:45.073 --> 00:05:48.379
I think we're inside of a ship,
one from a long time ago.

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:49.481
A ship?

00:05:49.581 --> 00:05:51.885
I wonder if there's
any relics left inside.

00:05:51.985 --> 00:05:53.355
[laughing]

00:05:53.456 --> 00:05:54.324
Oh.

00:05:54.424 --> 00:05:56.428
Relics. Relics!

00:05:56.528 --> 00:05:59.601
But why would there be a
ship all the way down here?

00:05:59.701 --> 00:06:01.905
Any relics hiding out there?

00:06:02.005 --> 00:06:04.978
Hello? Relics?

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:06.915
[distant roar]

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.660
I heard that earlier today.

00:06:12.761 --> 00:06:14.364
What could it be?

00:06:14.464 --> 00:06:16.235
I know that cry.

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:19.207
Sounds like a splitjaw.

00:06:20.276 --> 00:06:21.043
Go. Run!

00:06:21.145 --> 00:06:23.315
[gasping]

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.223
[Riko] <i>There's a wound</i>
<i>on its head.</i>

00:06:27.323 --> 00:06:29.461
<i>That must be the one</i>
<i>that Reg already blasted.</i>

00:06:29.561 --> 00:06:32.567
<i>I've heard they have nests on</i>
<i>the third layer, but come on.</i>

00:06:32.667 --> 00:06:34.471
<i>Would it really remember us?</i>

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.616
[both scream]

00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:47.063
[roaring]

00:06:47.163 --> 00:06:49.267
Ow, owwie, ow...

00:06:53.742 --> 00:06:56.013
[Ozen] Once you fire that
thing, no matter how much

00:06:56.114 --> 00:06:58.619
you push yourself, you
always faint afterwards.

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:02.293
And then it's a full two hours
before you wake up again.

00:07:02.393 --> 00:07:04.431
What do you think will
happen to her all alone

00:07:04.531 --> 00:07:07.002
for two hours in
the second layer?

00:07:07.103 --> 00:07:10.476
She will surely be torn
to shreds and eaten.

00:07:10.576 --> 00:07:13.148
Still, if you really do
have to use that thing,

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:15.386
be sure whatever it is,
it isn't able to

00:07:15.486 --> 00:07:17.423
come after you in the future.

00:07:17.524 --> 00:07:20.263
[Reg] <i>This is no time</i>
<i>to waver. Do it now!</i>

00:07:20.363 --> 00:07:22.267
-Reg!
-[Splitjaw roaring]

00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:25.306
Here. Use this!

00:07:27.042 --> 00:07:29.214
[Blaze Reap clicking]

00:07:31.185 --> 00:07:33.756
[Reg screaming]

00:07:33.856 --> 00:07:36.295
[explosions booming]

00:07:43.676 --> 00:07:47.049
[Reg gasping]

00:07:51.725 --> 00:07:55.833
I'd say the landscape around
here has become a lot harsher.

00:07:55.933 --> 00:07:58.672
Our depth is... let's see,

00:07:58.772 --> 00:08:02.213
6,750 meters, I think.

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:06.088
I heard these spikes
are some sort of egg.

00:08:06.188 --> 00:08:09.294
I wonder if there's a way to
make them into a tasty meal.

00:08:10.596 --> 00:08:11.498
Riko.

00:08:11.598 --> 00:08:13.569
I think I see
something down there.

00:08:13.669 --> 00:08:15.106
Hmm?

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.697
[steam hissing]

00:08:28.666 --> 00:08:31.104
[intrigued sighs]

00:08:31.204 --> 00:08:33.676
It must be the
Goblets of Giants.

00:08:57.857 --> 00:08:59.060
It seems fine.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.696
Just hot water.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.074
Although it sure is
pretty humid down here.

00:09:06.174 --> 00:09:08.312
[Riko] The Goblets of Giants.

00:09:08.412 --> 00:09:10.549
The flat-creepers are
responsible for that.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.021
I heard that the
landscape is blue due

00:09:13.122 --> 00:09:14.758
to the mixing of the
vapor and the light

00:09:14.858 --> 00:09:16.361
coming from the force field.

00:09:16.461 --> 00:09:17.930
Oh.

00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:21.037
Amazing. Simply amazing.

00:09:21.138 --> 00:09:23.442
We're actually witnessing
a place like this.

00:09:23.542 --> 00:09:25.479
Whenever I imagined
this layer, I never

00:09:25.579 --> 00:09:28.017
even thought about the humidity.

00:09:28.118 --> 00:09:30.957
Not to mention my voice
echoes like crazy.

00:09:31.058 --> 00:09:33.796
Plus, it smells
kind of stinky, too.

00:09:36.902 --> 00:09:39.441
Hey, Reg. Let's go.

00:09:39.541 --> 00:09:42.714
We need to find a decent place
and make camp for the night.

00:09:42.814 --> 00:09:45.286
[Reg] <i>Riko, you might not</i>
<i>say it out loud,</i>

00:09:45.386 --> 00:09:47.256
<i>but I'm sure you understand</i>

00:09:47.357 --> 00:09:49.561
<i>that no matter how much we</i>
<i>don't want to think about it,</i>

00:09:49.661 --> 00:09:51.531
<i>we're right in the belly</i>
<i>of the netherworld.</i>

00:09:51.631 --> 00:09:53.502
<i>And ascending in</i>
<i>the fourth layer</i>

00:09:53.602 --> 00:09:56.375
<i>will make you bleed out of</i>
<i>every part of your body.</i>

00:09:56.475 --> 00:09:57.977
<i>It truly is a curse.</i>

00:09:58.078 --> 00:10:00.783
<i>If Riko were to experience</i>
<i>something like that,</i>

00:10:00.883 --> 00:10:02.720
<i>I'm not sure she'd...</i>

00:10:03.956 --> 00:10:05.092
<i>never mind that.</i>

00:10:05.192 --> 00:10:07.864
<i>I must protect her.</i>

00:10:11.505 --> 00:10:13.509
So the final section
of the third layer

00:10:13.609 --> 00:10:15.813
had those spiky
egg things, right?

00:10:15.913 --> 00:10:17.550
Yep.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:20.423
If one of those hatches,
I hear it becomes

00:10:20.523 --> 00:10:23.729
one of those squid things.

00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:26.702
It's a species that still
hasn't been given a name yet.

00:10:26.802 --> 00:10:31.144
You know, less than 10% of the
creatures that are down here

00:10:31.244 --> 00:10:33.082
have ever been given a name.

00:10:33.182 --> 00:10:35.553
There are tens of
thousands of species.

00:10:36.722 --> 00:10:38.125
What's wrong?

00:10:38.225 --> 00:10:40.329
I don't know. I'm not sure.

00:10:40.429 --> 00:10:42.767
For a while I've been
sensing a strange presence.

00:10:42.867 --> 00:10:44.137
Huh?

00:10:44.237 --> 00:10:47.477
What is it? A creature
or a White Whistle?

00:10:47.577 --> 00:10:51.151
It only seems to start moving
whenever we begin to talk.

00:10:51.251 --> 00:10:52.887
It's not moving right now.

00:10:52.987 --> 00:10:54.958
It very likely has
good hearing,

00:10:55.059 --> 00:10:58.365
and I bet it can understand
what we're saying as well.

00:10:58.465 --> 00:11:00.034
[Riko] Could it be
another raider?

00:11:00.136 --> 00:11:03.142
I mean, it doesn't really have
to be a White Whistle, right?

00:11:03.242 --> 00:11:05.246
[Reg] It's certainly strange.

00:11:05.346 --> 00:11:07.517
I can't even begin to
pin down its position.

00:11:07.617 --> 00:11:10.423
Well, whatever it is,
I don't like it.

00:11:10.523 --> 00:11:12.794
Maybe we should get the
heck out of this place.

00:11:12.894 --> 00:11:14.464
Good idea.

00:11:18.839 --> 00:11:22.045
[Reg] <i>These "umbrellas" and</i>
<i>steam provide good coverage,</i>

00:11:22.146 --> 00:11:25.219
<i>but walking's hard</i>
<i>and visibility is bad.</i>

00:11:25.319 --> 00:11:27.957
[heavy breathing]

00:11:28.058 --> 00:11:30.196
Riko? You all right?

00:11:30.296 --> 00:11:31.598
Yeah.

00:11:31.698 --> 00:11:33.402
At the very least, we
need to find somewhere we

00:11:33.502 --> 00:11:34.938
can camp for the night.

00:11:40.382 --> 00:11:42.854
Hey, what's bothering you, Reg?

00:11:48.465 --> 00:11:50.803
[splashing]

00:11:53.375 --> 00:11:56.581
[growling]

00:11:58.252 --> 00:12:00.856
[nervous whimpers]

00:12:00.956 --> 00:12:02.960
[growling]

00:12:06.168 --> 00:12:07.436
What's this one?

00:12:07.537 --> 00:12:10.142
Don't go near it.
We need to run for it.

00:12:10.242 --> 00:12:12.045
That thing is an orb-piercer!

00:12:12.146 --> 00:12:14.117
[roaring]

00:12:14.217 --> 00:12:15.753
Reg, don't fight it.

00:12:15.853 --> 00:12:19.527
An orb-piercer's quills
can penetrate even steel.

00:12:19.627 --> 00:12:21.631
They're laced with poison.

00:12:21.731 --> 00:12:23.402
More than 100 cave
raiders have already

00:12:23.502 --> 00:12:24.637
been killed by these things.

00:12:24.737 --> 00:12:25.873
[gasps]

00:12:25.973 --> 00:12:28.245
[Reg] <i>I didn't sense it</i>
<i>until it was too close!</i>

00:12:28.345 --> 00:12:31.551
<i>Such a foul beast</i>
<i>from the depths.</i>

00:12:35.793 --> 00:12:36.461
What?!

00:12:36.561 --> 00:12:38.065
<i>The backpack!</i>

00:12:38.165 --> 00:12:40.536
<i>I thought I dodged that one.</i>

00:12:42.273 --> 00:12:43.609
It's fast.

00:12:43.709 --> 00:12:47.216
Or rather, it predicted my path.

00:12:47.316 --> 00:12:48.252
Look, Reg.

00:12:48.352 --> 00:12:50.289
The Blaze Reap is over there!

00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:52.460
[Reg] <i>It's down by its feet.</i>

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.929
<i>Not good.</i>

00:12:57.637 --> 00:12:59.707
What the-- How did it--

00:12:59.807 --> 00:13:02.346
Does it actually know
what the Blaze Reap is?

00:13:02.446 --> 00:13:03.982
Be careful, Reg.

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:05.686
Remember what Ozen said.

00:13:05.786 --> 00:13:08.024
These primeval creatures
of the depths,

00:13:08.125 --> 00:13:10.062
they have amazing intuition.

00:13:13.902 --> 00:13:15.004
<i>Here it comes.</i>

00:13:15.105 --> 00:13:17.243
Reg, take this!

00:13:17.343 --> 00:13:18.445
It should recoil from anything

00:13:18.545 --> 00:13:20.316
that appears to be
bigger than itself.

00:13:20.416 --> 00:13:22.153
So here, try to use
this Scaled Umbrella.

00:13:22.253 --> 00:13:23.889
Okay. This is it.

00:13:27.797 --> 00:13:30.536
[growling]

00:13:33.242 --> 00:13:35.880
Stop right there!

00:13:36.815 --> 00:13:38.552
[roaring]

00:13:40.021 --> 00:13:42.627
[roaring]

00:13:42.727 --> 00:13:44.764
<i>I don't think our</i>
<i>umbrella was big enough.</i>

00:13:44.864 --> 00:13:46.101
Didn't work, Riko.

00:13:46.201 --> 00:13:48.906
We need to try to make our way
over toward the Blaze Re--

00:13:49.474 --> 00:13:52.480
[heartbeat echoing]

00:13:54.884 --> 00:13:56.087
[gasp]

00:13:56.955 --> 00:13:59.227
It got me.

00:13:59.327 --> 00:14:01.097
The poison.

00:14:02.366 --> 00:14:04.237
We need something
to constrict it.

00:14:04.337 --> 00:14:07.710
[heartbeat continues]

00:14:08.579 --> 00:14:10.482
I'm sorry, Reg.

00:14:11.384 --> 00:14:13.422
Look out!

00:14:17.863 --> 00:14:18.632
Riko.

00:14:18.732 --> 00:14:20.001
This is going to hurt a bit.

00:14:20.102 --> 00:14:21.871
[Riko screams]

00:14:26.514 --> 00:14:28.050
[Reg] <i>What now?</i>

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:32.025
Okay, Riko.
Now hold out your arm.

00:14:32.126 --> 00:14:34.130
[Riko crying]

00:14:36.601 --> 00:14:38.171
<i>What should I do?</i>

00:14:38.272 --> 00:14:39.607
<i>How can I save her?</i>

00:14:39.707 --> 00:14:42.680
<i>The Blaze Reap is-- Damn it.</i>

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.851
<i>It's already submerged.</i>

00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:49.494
<i>Even if I act as a decoy, Riko</i>
<i>can't go and get it like this.</i>

00:14:50.195 --> 00:14:52.300
<i>My Incinerator? No.</i>

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.973
<i>If I faint for two hours,</i>
<i>who knows what will happen?</i>

00:14:56.574 --> 00:14:58.245
<i>Escape.</i>

00:14:58.345 --> 00:14:59.881
<i>That's our only option.</i>

00:14:59.981 --> 00:15:03.088
<i>However, given its ability</i>
<i>to predict our movements,</i>

00:15:03.188 --> 00:15:04.724
<i>we can't just run from it.</i>

00:15:04.824 --> 00:15:08.732
<i>If that's the case, up it is.</i>

00:15:08.832 --> 00:15:11.871
<i>But the strain of</i>
<i>ascending would cause...</i>

00:15:13.275 --> 00:15:16.013
...intense pain and
bleeding throughout her body.

00:15:16.114 --> 00:15:17.516
[grunt]

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:20.422
Riko.

00:15:20.522 --> 00:15:21.891
You've got to do it.

00:15:21.992 --> 00:15:23.695
We have to, Reg.

00:15:23.795 --> 00:15:25.833
No. You say that, but--

00:15:25.933 --> 00:15:27.603
Please, Reg.

00:15:28.672 --> 00:15:31.244
I'm so sorry, Reg.

00:15:31.344 --> 00:15:33.081
I can't.

00:15:33.181 --> 00:15:38.125
It seems I don't have
much time left here.

00:15:38.225 --> 00:15:40.729
[gasping]

00:15:43.201 --> 00:15:46.074
[growling]

00:15:48.211 --> 00:15:49.714
[exhale]

00:15:50.182 --> 00:15:51.584
[inhale]

00:15:52.186 --> 00:15:55.959
AH!

00:16:18.338 --> 00:16:19.874
Riko, please talk to me.

00:16:19.974 --> 00:16:23.081
Riko, please wake up for me.

00:16:23.181 --> 00:16:25.753
[whimpering]

00:16:26.454 --> 00:16:28.225
Awake...

00:16:30.829 --> 00:16:33.402
Reg, what's the matter?

00:16:33.502 --> 00:16:36.541
-I feel kind of strange.
-What the-- Please, Riko.

00:16:36.641 --> 00:16:38.578
What are you talking about?

00:16:41.049 --> 00:16:42.887
Hey, Reg.

00:16:42.987 --> 00:16:45.726
It doesn't hurt that much.

00:16:47.263 --> 00:16:48.999
[muffled pop]

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.402
What's going on?

00:16:50.502 --> 00:16:51.771
Riko.

00:16:51.871 --> 00:16:53.241
It might be that the Curse
would cause the poison

00:16:53.341 --> 00:16:56.247
to be expelled from the body
first before your blood.

00:16:56.347 --> 00:16:58.318
That makes sense.

00:16:58.418 --> 00:17:00.489
So now just to stop
the bleeding and--

00:17:00.589 --> 00:17:02.560
[gasp]

00:17:03.195 --> 00:17:04.330
Yeah.

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:06.067
That's it.

00:17:07.269 --> 00:17:09.140
Reg.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.580
I'll be good as new, Reg.

00:17:13.348 --> 00:17:16.387
After the poison's out,

00:17:16.488 --> 00:17:18.825
stop the bleeding--

00:17:19.994 --> 00:17:22.833
Riko, please.
You have to wake up!

00:17:22.933 --> 00:17:26.174
Reg, I'm going to be all right.

00:17:26.274 --> 00:17:27.376
Oh, god.

00:17:27.476 --> 00:17:29.413
I think she's starting
to hallucinate.

00:17:29.514 --> 00:17:31.351
We must be close
to the third layer.

00:17:31.451 --> 00:17:34.624
[gasping]

00:17:37.696 --> 00:17:40.235
The blood won't stop
coming out of her.

00:17:40.335 --> 00:17:41.638
Just calm down.

00:17:41.738 --> 00:17:44.110
Besides, I need to
check the wound.

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:45.913
[gasp]

00:17:46.013 --> 00:17:46.848
No.

00:17:46.948 --> 00:17:48.385
It's so swelled up.

00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:49.654
It's gotten so bloated.

00:17:49.754 --> 00:17:54.263
I... I need to
take off her glove.

00:17:55.666 --> 00:17:58.371
[screaming]

00:17:58.472 --> 00:18:01.444
Did-- Did that hurt?
I'm sorry.

00:18:01.544 --> 00:18:03.281
[coughing]

00:18:06.187 --> 00:18:07.523
Please, Reg.

00:18:07.623 --> 00:18:10.295
Riko, I'm here!

00:18:10.395 --> 00:18:11.831
It's too swollen.

00:18:11.931 --> 00:18:13.702
I can't get the glove off.

00:18:13.802 --> 00:18:15.004
What should I do?

00:18:15.105 --> 00:18:17.676
Help me. How can I save you?

00:18:18.178 --> 00:18:20.716
[whimpering]

00:18:23.255 --> 00:18:25.125
Is it hurting you?

00:18:25.225 --> 00:18:26.461
Please say something.

00:18:26.561 --> 00:18:28.932
[whimpering]

00:18:29.032 --> 00:18:30.369
Cut it.

00:18:31.871 --> 00:18:34.877
[labored breathing]

00:18:34.977 --> 00:18:35.913
Please.

00:18:36.013 --> 00:18:38.852
Cut it... Cut it off.

00:18:43.161 --> 00:18:44.463
Riko.

00:18:44.564 --> 00:18:45.832
You don't know
what you're saying.

00:18:45.933 --> 00:18:48.305
If I do that, you'll
never be able to--

00:18:48.405 --> 00:18:50.375
Reg, please.

00:18:50.475 --> 00:18:52.246
Just do it.

00:18:52.346 --> 00:18:53.782
If you can't do it...

00:18:53.882 --> 00:18:56.354
[labored breathing]

00:18:57.256 --> 00:18:58.592
I will die.

00:18:58.692 --> 00:19:01.664
[coughing]

00:19:04.337 --> 00:19:05.906
Please, Reg.

00:19:06.608 --> 00:19:08.445
I'm really scared.

00:19:08.545 --> 00:19:11.451
I'm so scared, Reg.

00:19:11.551 --> 00:19:13.321
[crying]

00:19:13.421 --> 00:19:14.924
<i>I should have...</i>

00:19:15.024 --> 00:19:18.732
<i>If only I had just made Riko</i>
<i>stay farther behind me.</i>

00:19:22.873 --> 00:19:24.877
Listen to me, Reg.

00:19:24.977 --> 00:19:27.616
You're going to have to
break the bone first.

00:19:27.716 --> 00:19:28.885
What?

00:19:28.985 --> 00:19:32.326
A Black Whistle
who had this happen...

00:19:32.426 --> 00:19:34.997
He said cutting it was tough.

00:19:35.098 --> 00:19:37.903
[crying]

00:19:41.744 --> 00:19:43.114
<i>If only.</i>

00:19:43.214 --> 00:19:46.154
<i>If only I had just</i>
<i>used my Incinerator.</i>

00:19:48.658 --> 00:19:49.927
<i>If only.</i>

00:19:50.027 --> 00:19:52.299
<i>If only I'd been</i>
<i>a better shield.</i>

00:19:55.672 --> 00:19:57.343
<i>This is no time to cry!</i>

00:19:57.443 --> 00:20:00.515
<i>The more I hesitate,</i>
<i>the more Riko suffers!</i>

00:20:06.227 --> 00:20:07.496
Here it goes.

00:20:07.596 --> 00:20:08.865
Riko.

00:20:14.343 --> 00:20:15.345
[cracking]

00:20:15.445 --> 00:20:18.752
[screaming and sobbing]

00:20:28.003 --> 00:20:30.175
[sobbing continues]

00:20:30.609 --> 00:20:31.978
[gasp]

00:20:41.564 --> 00:20:43.101
What am I doing?

00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:45.439
I don't even know
what I'm doing to her.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.476
Reg.

00:20:48.878 --> 00:20:51.117
Please don't leave me.

00:20:51.217 --> 00:20:52.619
Riko, it's me.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.722
I'm right here.

00:20:53.822 --> 00:20:56.361
Don't go. Don't go.

00:20:56.461 --> 00:21:02.439
Take me with you, together,
to the bottom of the--

00:21:02.539 --> 00:21:05.579
Riko, you're starting
to lose consciousness.

00:21:07.583 --> 00:21:09.487
I promise to take you there!

00:21:10.689 --> 00:21:12.926
You've got an awful fever.

00:21:13.027 --> 00:21:16.300
<i>Don't you dare go</i>
<i>and leave me behind.</i>

00:21:17.136 --> 00:21:18.371
<i>Hurry.</i>

00:21:18.471 --> 00:21:19.774
<i>I've got to hurry.</i>

00:21:19.874 --> 00:21:22.413

<i>My hands are shaking.</i>

00:21:26.754 --> 00:21:28.091
<i>Pull yourself together.</i>

00:21:28.191 --> 00:21:31.029
<i>You don't want Riko</i>
<i>to suffer even more.</i>

00:21:34.637 --> 00:21:37.876
[tearing noise]

00:21:40.949 --> 00:21:43.421
[buzzing]

00:21:46.994 --> 00:21:49.800
Damn you! Don't!

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.637
Don't get in my way!

00:21:51.738 --> 00:21:54.610
Leave! Stay away from Riko!

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:56.447
Get out of here!

00:21:56.547 --> 00:21:58.985
[panting]

00:22:17.956 --> 00:22:19.660
[gasp]

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.197
She's not breathing.

00:22:21.297 --> 00:22:21.964
Riko!

00:22:22.066 --> 00:22:23.568
Don't do this to me.

00:22:23.668 --> 00:22:25.572
Breathe! Riko!

00:22:25.672 --> 00:22:26.841
Riko!

00:22:26.941 --> 00:22:29.045
[soft solemn music]

00:22:33.555 --> 00:22:36.260
Riko. Riko.

00:22:37.329 --> 00:22:38.965
Hold on.

00:22:39.066 --> 00:22:41.671
Don't leave me behind, Riko.

00:22:41.771 --> 00:22:45.912
[sobbing]

00:22:47.983 --> 00:22:50.020
[sobbing echoes]

00:22:50.722 --> 00:22:54.630
Riko, no!

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:57.369
Open your eyes, Riko!

00:22:57.469 --> 00:22:59.273
Riko!

00:23:01.144 --> 00:23:03.348
[voice] You are very noisy.

00:23:05.886 --> 00:23:07.122
That girl there?

00:23:07.222 --> 00:23:09.393
Her heart is still beating,
just so you know.

00:23:09.493 --> 00:23:12.499
Though it could possibly
stop at any moment.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.503
What are you?

00:23:15.505 --> 00:23:18.144
I'm just a fluffy
stuffed animal.

00:23:18.244 --> 00:23:20.682
I've come here to try
and comfort you two.

00:23:20.782 --> 00:23:22.786
Huh? You what?

00:23:22.886 --> 00:23:24.390
Who the heck do
you think you are?

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:27.229
I'm happy to properly
introduce myself.

00:23:27.329 --> 00:23:29.934
But first, wouldn't
it be best to hear

00:23:30.034 --> 00:23:32.372
how we can go about saving her?

00:23:33.708 --> 00:23:35.212
Riko?

00:23:35.846 --> 00:23:38.518
Nnaa, this is quite bad.

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.889
What should I do?

00:23:40.989 --> 00:23:42.793
Please, please tell me.

00:23:42.893 --> 00:23:44.063
I want to save my friend!

00:23:44.163 --> 00:23:46.267
How can I get her
to breathe again?

00:23:46.367 --> 00:23:49.874
Just pucker up and blow a
breath directly into her mouth,

00:23:49.974 --> 00:23:51.677
just like a kiss.

00:23:51.777 --> 00:23:53.748
Do you know how to do that?

00:23:55.085 --> 00:23:57.489
[blowing out air]

00:24:00.996 --> 00:24:02.599
Like that?

00:24:02.699 --> 00:24:06.741
That looks good, but go a little
slower and pinch her nose shut.

00:24:06.841 --> 00:24:08.411
Okay.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.350
[blowing]

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.490
Also, tilt up her chin
to open the airway.

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:16.794
Otherwise, there's
no point to this.

00:24:16.894 --> 00:24:18.164
Got it.

00:24:18.865 --> 00:24:20.435
[blowing]

00:24:21.103 --> 00:24:22.139
[weak breathing]

00:24:22.239 --> 00:24:25.044
[gasping]

00:24:30.255 --> 00:24:32.426
Yes. She's breathing again.

00:24:32.993 --> 00:24:34.563
It's working.

00:24:35.665 --> 00:24:37.870
Oh, thank you.

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:39.373
Thank you so much.

00:24:39.473 --> 00:24:42.379
It's still too early
to relax just yet.

00:24:43.548 --> 00:24:45.752
She hasn't regained
consciousness.

00:24:45.852 --> 00:24:48.091
No? Well, then, what's next?

00:24:48.191 --> 00:24:49.460
What do I do?

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.063
Just calm down.

00:24:51.163 --> 00:24:53.101
If she were awake right
now, she wouldn't be

00:24:53.201 --> 00:24:54.670
able to bear
the pain anyway.

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:55.872
But what do I--

00:24:55.972 --> 00:24:57.209
You do this.

00:24:57.309 --> 00:24:59.380
You need to carry the
girl back to my hideout.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.884
-Huh?
-I'll figure something out.

00:25:01.984 --> 00:25:03.488
Wait. You'll what?

00:25:03.588 --> 00:25:05.692
But you don't know anything
about the two of us.

00:25:05.792 --> 00:25:07.129
Yes.

00:25:07.229 --> 00:25:08.865
Perhaps you should
keep your distance.

00:25:08.965 --> 00:25:11.437
Well--

00:25:11.537 --> 00:25:14.810
Looking at the state of her
arm, it's going to snap off.

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:16.847
You need to reinforce it.

00:25:16.948 --> 00:25:18.518
Go fetch some
branches for support.

00:25:18.618 --> 00:25:20.689
So you mean you
can fix her hand?

00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:22.125
Right. I'm on it.

00:25:22.225 --> 00:25:23.561
But let me warn you,

00:25:23.661 --> 00:25:27.135
it's not going to go back
to the way it was before!

00:25:28.538 --> 00:25:31.243
Geez. He's not even listening.

00:25:37.522 --> 00:25:39.727
[soft music]

00:25:50.815 --> 00:25:52.219
Huh?

00:25:52.853 --> 00:25:54.490
Hey, hold on.

00:25:55.692 --> 00:25:57.663
If I climb up this,
it'll hurt her more.

00:25:57.763 --> 00:25:59.466
[sighs]

00:25:59.566 --> 00:26:02.406
I guess you aren't able
to see it after all.

00:26:02.506 --> 00:26:05.512
See what? What are
you talking about?

00:26:05.612 --> 00:26:07.416
Just take it easy.

00:26:07.516 --> 00:26:09.653
The Curse isn't
present right now.

00:26:09.753 --> 00:26:12.192
But if we don't hurry,
then her whole body

00:26:12.292 --> 00:26:14.563
will swell up just like her arm.

00:26:16.767 --> 00:26:18.338
Okay, then.

00:26:26.454 --> 00:26:28.491
[music continues]

00:26:36.907 --> 00:26:39.246
What is this place?

00:26:56.881 --> 00:27:00.020
[Reg] What's all this cave
raiding equipment doing here?

00:27:00.121 --> 00:27:02.893
And those whistles?

00:27:04.196 --> 00:27:06.600
Excuse me, who are you exactly?

00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:10.542
I suppose I never
did tell you my name.

00:27:12.779 --> 00:27:13.948
[gasp]

00:27:15.552 --> 00:27:17.622
You may call me Nanachi.

00:27:17.723 --> 00:27:20.962
I'm what you cave raiders
have come to fear.

00:27:21.063 --> 00:27:22.366
I am a Hollow.

00:27:22.466 --> 00:27:25.138
You're known as a "Hollow"?

00:27:25.238 --> 00:27:27.843
[Reg] <i>It looks like a child.</i>

00:27:28.911 --> 00:27:30.248
Interesting.

00:27:30.348 --> 00:27:32.519
So you've never heard
anything about us?

00:27:32.619 --> 00:27:36.560
Ah, well, suppose you don't look
like a normal cave raider.

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:39.666
All right, lay her
down over here.

00:27:39.767 --> 00:27:40.869
[gulp]

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:44.610
Nanachi, please forgive me.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:46.347
I don't mean to be
rude, but aren't

00:27:46.447 --> 00:27:48.684
you about the
same age as us?

00:27:48.785 --> 00:27:49.653
You nervous?

00:27:49.753 --> 00:27:51.223
[stammers]

00:27:51.323 --> 00:27:53.728
You want to go and try
finding someone else?

00:27:55.832 --> 00:27:57.669
[wincing]

00:28:00.308 --> 00:28:03.414
I beg you, please do
what you can to save her.

00:28:04.616 --> 00:28:05.819
Nnaa...

00:28:05.919 --> 00:28:07.622
That's a good boy.

00:28:08.591 --> 00:28:11.063
Among cave raiders,
it's pretty common

00:28:11.163 --> 00:28:13.301
to handle a wound
like this, but that's

00:28:13.401 --> 00:28:15.972
because they don't know
the proper way to do it.

00:28:17.275 --> 00:28:19.913
What are you-- the
poison is going to--

00:28:20.013 --> 00:28:21.617
Don't be so melodramatic.

00:28:21.717 --> 00:28:23.454
The poison will flow
through her body,

00:28:23.554 --> 00:28:25.391
and then we'll get rid of it.

00:28:25.492 --> 00:28:27.395
This is medicine made
from a friend of mine,

00:28:27.496 --> 00:28:29.433
that I hardened with wax.

00:28:32.806 --> 00:28:35.345
[Nanachi] When it's not
possible to give orally,

00:28:35.445 --> 00:28:36.981
you have to use the other end.

00:28:37.082 --> 00:28:39.253
Oh, I don't--

00:28:42.459 --> 00:28:44.028
Now, let's move on to her arm.

00:28:44.129 --> 00:28:46.967
First, remove the bone
fragments, and then stitch up

00:28:47.068 --> 00:28:48.871
the blood vessels and flesh.

00:28:48.971 --> 00:28:52.179
Oh, look, this white thing
right here is a nerve.

00:28:52.279 --> 00:28:55.050
A number of them were
severely damaged.

00:28:55.151 --> 00:28:59.593
But I'm not very good at
stitching these up, though.

00:29:01.297 --> 00:29:04.369
Still, the way you cut
her is pretty gruesome.

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:07.007
It's a good thing she
passed out on you.

00:29:24.576 --> 00:29:28.417
All right, I think that
should do for the time being.

00:29:29.086 --> 00:29:30.455
That's a relief.

00:29:30.555 --> 00:29:32.959
I'm afraid now
comes the hard part.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:36.300
I'm going to need you to
fetch a bunch of stuff for me.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.736
Just tell me
what I need to do!

00:29:37.836 --> 00:29:40.441
Yeah, not so close.
Keep your distance.

00:29:40.542 --> 00:29:42.212
I'm sorry for
doubting you earlier.

00:29:42.312 --> 00:29:45.818
Tell me what it is you need,
whatever it takes to save her!

00:29:47.489 --> 00:29:48.991
I have a question.

00:29:49.092 --> 00:29:51.597
Why didn't you just cut
her at the elbow joint,

00:29:51.697 --> 00:29:53.501
when you were severing her arm?

00:29:53.601 --> 00:29:56.440
You could have gotten it off
without breaking the bone.

00:29:58.077 --> 00:29:59.479
Well, I--

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:02.919
Were you, perhaps, just
following her directions?

00:30:03.321 --> 00:30:04.122
I was.

00:30:04.223 --> 00:30:05.692
Oh, I see then.

00:30:05.792 --> 00:30:08.097
She must be an
extraordinary girl.

00:30:08.197 --> 00:30:09.566
Hm?

00:30:09.666 --> 00:30:11.971
If the part passed the
elbow is left intact,

00:30:12.072 --> 00:30:15.178
then it totally changes what
one can do when cave raiding.

00:30:15.278 --> 00:30:18.818
She was still
determined to press on.

00:30:18.918 --> 00:30:21.357
Even finding herself
in this situation,

00:30:21.457 --> 00:30:24.429
she still didn't want to
give up on her adventure.

00:30:27.168 --> 00:30:29.439
[soft breathing]

00:30:30.541 --> 00:30:32.846
R-- Riko.

00:30:34.082 --> 00:30:35.752
Oh, that's right.

00:30:35.852 --> 00:30:39.092
I still haven't told you what
our names are yet, have I?

00:30:39.192 --> 00:30:41.597
My name's Reg,
and that's Riko.

00:30:41.697 --> 00:30:44.236
-Yes, I know.
-Huh?

00:30:44.336 --> 00:30:45.638
It's the first time
anyone like you two

00:30:45.738 --> 00:30:47.676
have ever come around here.

00:30:47.776 --> 00:30:49.580
Ever since you entered
my hunting grounds,

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.617
I've heard everything
you've said.

00:30:53.387 --> 00:30:55.224
Then... Then you're...

00:30:55.325 --> 00:30:59.031
You're the presence I sensed
once we got to the fourth layer.

00:30:59.833 --> 00:31:02.072
So it was you
this whole time.

00:31:02.172 --> 00:31:04.242
Yeah, that sounds right.

00:31:04.343 --> 00:31:06.380
I was watching
every move you made,

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.722
or I wouldn't have been there to
treat the orb-piercer's poison.

00:31:10.822 --> 00:31:15.231
So you were there, even
when that thing attacked us?

00:31:15.331 --> 00:31:16.467
That's right.

00:31:16.567 --> 00:31:19.106
I was watching and listening.

00:31:24.383 --> 00:31:26.587
Well, now, the look
on your face says

00:31:26.687 --> 00:31:28.457
you're wondering why
I didn't help you.

00:31:28.557 --> 00:31:32.565
I was only interested in
knowing what you were up to.

00:31:32.666 --> 00:31:35.338
In all honesty, I had no
intention of showing myself.

00:31:35.438 --> 00:31:39.146
Wha-- So why did you
save us then?

00:31:39.246 --> 00:31:40.882
Because I started
to pity to you.

00:31:40.982 --> 00:31:45.058
"Oh, Riko, don't
leave me behind!"

00:31:45.158 --> 00:31:48.364
You were sobbing like
some poor, little lost kid.

00:31:48.464 --> 00:31:49.967
I couldn't stand it anymore.

00:31:50.068 --> 00:31:51.870
[crying]

00:31:52.973 --> 00:31:54.242
[eerie groan]

00:31:54.343 --> 00:31:55.912
What's that?

00:31:58.551 --> 00:32:00.855
Is there someone
else who lives here?

00:32:00.955 --> 00:32:02.525
Just my roommate.

00:32:03.995 --> 00:32:05.565
I'll introduce you.

00:32:12.145 --> 00:32:14.916
Let me present you to
my cute little Mitty.

00:32:15.918 --> 00:32:17.021
[gasp]

00:32:19.059 --> 00:32:22.565
[eerie cooing]

00:32:24.269 --> 00:32:26.607
What is that?

00:32:26.707 --> 00:32:30.081
-This child is also a Hollow.
-What?

00:32:30.181 --> 00:32:33.354
Have you heard the perils of
ascending from the sixth layer?

00:32:33.454 --> 00:32:36.460
I was told it causes
the loss of humanity,

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.164
or even death, at times.

00:32:38.731 --> 00:32:39.800
[Nanachi] Right.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:41.704
If someone survives
the ascension,

00:32:41.804 --> 00:32:44.041
this is what becomes of them.

00:32:44.142 --> 00:32:47.182
Their personality
and intellect vanish.

00:32:47.282 --> 00:32:50.421
The person becomes a hollow
husk of who they once were.

00:32:50.521 --> 00:32:52.592
No matter what has
been tried, no one's

00:32:52.692 --> 00:32:54.863
ever gone back to how they were.

00:32:54.963 --> 00:32:57.335
That trick you used where
you extended your arm,

00:32:57.435 --> 00:33:00.108
just thinking about what would
happen if you did that

00:33:00.208 --> 00:33:03.147
on this sixth layer
is pretty thrilling.

00:33:05.518 --> 00:33:09.726
But... But, Nanachi,
you're not--

00:33:09.826 --> 00:33:11.897
you don't look
anything like that.

00:33:11.997 --> 00:33:12.932
Well, yeah.

00:33:13.032 --> 00:33:14.736
There's a reason
for that, you see.

00:33:14.836 --> 00:33:16.740
I'm an exception
among exceptions.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.246
So don't get your
hopes up too much.

00:33:21.116 --> 00:33:22.385
There, there, Mitty.

00:33:22.485 --> 00:33:24.856
You know you're exceptional too.

00:33:25.558 --> 00:33:26.860
That reminds me.

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.366
If a cave raider ever
becomes a hollow,

00:33:29.466 --> 00:33:30.935
their fellow cave
raiders kill them

00:33:31.035 --> 00:33:32.806
and collect their belongings.

00:33:32.906 --> 00:33:35.078
Given the alternative,
I suppose it's better

00:33:35.178 --> 00:33:36.780
to tell people they died.

00:33:37.916 --> 00:33:40.555
Imagine if I were out
in the open like this.

00:33:40.655 --> 00:33:42.859
I am living proof that
it's possible to return

00:33:42.959 --> 00:33:44.729
from the sixth layer
while still retaining

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:46.934
some sense of humanity.

00:33:47.034 --> 00:33:49.940
Naturally, people would come
capture me, if they could.

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.178
Revealing myself to
a bunch of cave raiders

00:33:52.278 --> 00:33:53.547
is a big risk for me.

00:33:53.647 --> 00:33:55.818
Even if it was only out
of pity, saving someone

00:33:55.918 --> 00:33:57.455
is a good thing, right?

00:33:57.555 --> 00:33:58.657
I see.

00:33:58.758 --> 00:34:00.628
That's your situation.

00:34:00.728 --> 00:34:02.565
I'm sorry for that.

00:34:02.665 --> 00:34:04.936
[Nanachi] <i>Such a softy.</i>

00:34:06.673 --> 00:34:08.644
There, I'm done sketching it.

00:34:08.744 --> 00:34:11.183
Huh? What's this?

00:34:11.283 --> 00:34:13.788
The materials necessary
for healing Riko,

00:34:13.888 --> 00:34:15.291
and where to find them.

00:34:15.391 --> 00:34:17.362
I even signed it for you.

00:34:18.831 --> 00:34:20.535
She still has some
internal bleeding,

00:34:20.635 --> 00:34:23.039
and her arm will likely
rot off, at this rate.

00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:25.478
Listen, all I've
done at this point

00:34:25.578 --> 00:34:27.782
is effectively delay her death.

00:34:28.684 --> 00:34:31.056
She'll hold on for
another 12 hours.

00:34:31.156 --> 00:34:32.792
If it takes longer
than that, you better

00:34:32.892 --> 00:34:35.198
think of a tactful
way to say goodbye.

00:34:36.333 --> 00:34:38.604
Don't say something like that!

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.860
[Nanachi] I guess you aren't
able to see it after all.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:53.868
<i>Later, I need to ask</i>
<i>what that means exactly.</i>

00:34:53.968 --> 00:34:55.838
<i>There's so much</i>
<i>to keep up with.</i>

00:34:55.938 --> 00:34:58.444
<i>I just can't keep calm.</i>

00:34:58.544 --> 00:34:59.880
<i>But for right now,</i>

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:02.919
<i>I need only think</i>
<i>of saving Riko.</i>

00:35:08.764 --> 00:35:10.134
[Nanachi] <i>I was right.</i>

00:35:10.234 --> 00:35:13.340
<i>My eyes didn't</i>
<i>deceive me, after all.</i>

00:35:14.709 --> 00:35:18.684
[voice] <i>Nanachi. Nanachi.</i>

00:35:19.586 --> 00:35:22.292
This new cartridge
is wonderful.

00:35:22.392 --> 00:35:23.794
I'm very pleased.

00:35:23.894 --> 00:35:26.600
I wish you would look happier.

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:29.406
It's all thanks
to you, after all.

00:35:29.506 --> 00:35:32.278
Come on, smile for me.

00:35:32.378 --> 00:35:37.188
Let us celebrate to the
success of the experiment.

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:49.379
[Nanachi] <i>You can gather most</i>
<i>of it on the western side.</i>

00:35:49.479 --> 00:35:51.350
<i>Stay out of the central region.</i>

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:53.019
<i>Orby is in there.</i>

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.422
"Orby"?

00:35:54.522 --> 00:35:56.960
Does Nanachi mean
the orb-piercer?

00:36:01.035 --> 00:36:02.872
[Nanachi] <i>Bring back</i>
<i>a demonfish.</i>

00:36:02.972 --> 00:36:04.476
<i>The bigger the better.</i>

00:36:09.452 --> 00:36:11.356
[grunting]

00:36:12.358 --> 00:36:14.596
<i>Choose one with clear</i>
<i>color distinction</i>

00:36:14.696 --> 00:36:16.600
<i>between its back and belly.</i>

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:17.835
[screeching]

00:36:17.936 --> 00:36:20.541
<i>I need giant hammerbeak eggs.</i>

00:36:20.641 --> 00:36:22.979
<i>Take just one per nest.</i>

00:36:23.781 --> 00:36:26.186
<i>Freshly-laid ones are best.</i>

00:36:26.954 --> 00:36:28.324
This should do.

00:36:30.061 --> 00:36:32.765
<i>Pick some yellow shining grass.</i>

00:36:32.865 --> 00:36:35.104
<i>Find a spot where a</i>
<i>lot of it is growing,</i>

00:36:35.204 --> 00:36:38.210
<i>and grab the stuff that smells</i>
<i>somewhat better than the rest.</i>

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:39.512
[sniffing]

00:36:39.613 --> 00:36:41.015
Hm?

00:36:41.583 --> 00:36:43.019
[snorting]

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:46.893
<i>Find me a shroombear</i>
<i>infected with water-shrooms.</i>

00:36:49.466 --> 00:36:51.803
[bleating]

00:36:52.939 --> 00:36:54.442
[bleating]

00:36:54.542 --> 00:36:56.880
All right, I think
that's everything.

00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:59.853
[panting]

00:36:59.953 --> 00:37:02.458
Do it, Reg. Make it in time.

00:37:04.663 --> 00:37:05.931
Riko.

00:37:08.103 --> 00:37:09.172
Riko!

00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:13.280
Riko!

00:37:13.947 --> 00:37:15.284
Wh-- What are you--

00:37:15.384 --> 00:37:18.022
What do you
think you're doing?

00:37:18.891 --> 00:37:20.461
You're so loud.

00:37:20.561 --> 00:37:22.899
If we just leave her
soaking in blood and urine,

00:37:22.999 --> 00:37:24.102
she'll get a rash.

00:37:24.202 --> 00:37:28.544
Look, she really
peed quite a lot.

00:37:28.644 --> 00:37:29.779
You're going to
need to wash those.

00:37:29.879 --> 00:37:32.050
[stammering]

00:37:32.151 --> 00:37:34.956
Is Riko going to
be all right now?

00:37:35.057 --> 00:37:37.695
Sorry if I misunderstood.

00:37:37.795 --> 00:37:40.534
So is she doing okay?

00:37:40.634 --> 00:37:42.505
Calm down, you piece of junk.

00:37:42.605 --> 00:37:43.640
Splendid.

00:37:43.741 --> 00:37:45.043
This one's just perfect.

00:37:45.144 --> 00:37:46.747
You did pretty good.

00:37:46.847 --> 00:37:48.083
Yeah?

00:37:48.183 --> 00:37:50.221
Well, let's get
started right away.

00:37:50.321 --> 00:37:52.558
You and I are
going to save Riko.

00:37:53.794 --> 00:37:55.464
Okay.

00:37:55.564 --> 00:37:58.537
These water mushrooms
are parasitic in nature.

00:37:58.637 --> 00:37:59.939
[weak groan]

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.345
But when it looks like
their host is finally

00:38:02.445 --> 00:38:06.386
about to keel over and die, they
share their stored up nutrients

00:38:06.486 --> 00:38:08.090
to revive the host.

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:11.663
If the number of shroombears
in a new den increases,

00:38:11.763 --> 00:38:14.001
there'll be more
water-shrooms too.

00:38:14.102 --> 00:38:15.971
It's a symbiotic relationship.

00:38:16.073 --> 00:38:18.177
While Riko's still
unconscious, we're

00:38:18.277 --> 00:38:21.083
going to plant them on her
and put them to good use.

00:38:21.183 --> 00:38:23.187
She's got a good
vein there anyway,

00:38:23.287 --> 00:38:25.257
so we'll plant them
right by her wound.

00:38:25.358 --> 00:38:29.566
That should help with the
bone's healing process, as well.

00:38:29.666 --> 00:38:33.307
Also, they will help prevent
the rotting of her flesh.

00:38:33.407 --> 00:38:36.847
But they hurt like crazy,
when you pull them off.

00:38:38.917 --> 00:38:40.388
Um, Nanachi,

00:38:40.488 --> 00:38:43.025
what are you using the fish
and the rest of this stuff for?

00:38:43.127 --> 00:38:44.562
[Nanachi]
That should be obvious.

00:38:44.662 --> 00:38:46.466
For my dinner, of course.

00:38:47.468 --> 00:38:48.771
I cannot believe you!

00:38:48.871 --> 00:38:51.008
Seriously, I
gathered all this up.

00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:52.879
What would have happened,
if I'd been too late?

00:38:52.979 --> 00:38:54.382
Oh, calm down.

00:38:54.482 --> 00:38:56.820
You have to make so
much noise all the time?

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.390
But why would you
cut it so close?

00:38:58.490 --> 00:38:59.659
She's in bad shape!

00:38:59.759 --> 00:39:01.830
[Nanachi] I've been tending
to her since she got here,

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:03.934
so it's not like I
can go find food.

00:39:04.034 --> 00:39:05.871
If I collapse from
hunger, who's going

00:39:05.971 --> 00:39:08.177
to treat your
precious friend then?

00:39:09.879 --> 00:39:12.418
I suppose that's true.

00:39:12.518 --> 00:39:13.654
Forgive my rudeness.

00:39:13.754 --> 00:39:15.491
As long as you understand.

00:39:15.591 --> 00:39:18.263
<i>Such a pushover.</i>

00:39:22.205 --> 00:39:24.242
Don't make that sad little face.

00:39:24.342 --> 00:39:27.348
I know it doesn't look
pretty, but at least this

00:39:27.448 --> 00:39:28.851
will save her life.

00:39:28.951 --> 00:39:30.988
What? Really?
You mean it?

00:39:31.089 --> 00:39:32.925
You mean she's really
saved this time around?

00:39:33.025 --> 00:39:34.696
That's just what I said.

00:39:34.796 --> 00:39:35.898
Thank you.

00:39:35.998 --> 00:39:37.168
You're just the best.

00:39:37.268 --> 00:39:38.771
I owe you everything!

00:39:38.871 --> 00:39:40.441
[groan]

00:39:40.541 --> 00:39:42.411
You're too close again.

00:39:43.413 --> 00:39:45.951
You really are quite
fluffy, aren't you?

00:39:46.051 --> 00:39:48.657
Hey, why don't you
go out back and wash

00:39:48.757 --> 00:39:50.394
Riko's pee-stained clothes?

00:39:50.494 --> 00:39:52.799
There's a riverbed
you can use out there.

00:39:52.899 --> 00:39:54.335
[sigh]

00:39:54.836 --> 00:39:56.373
Yeah, okay.

00:40:04.289 --> 00:40:05.558
Whoa.

00:40:06.626 --> 00:40:10.601
"Flowers of Fortitude,"
Eternal Fortunes.

00:40:10.701 --> 00:40:13.039
[ethereal music]

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:19.552
Are those gravestones?

00:40:20.254 --> 00:40:22.658
-[heartbeat]
-[gasp]

00:40:23.494 --> 00:40:26.266
[voice] <i>I'll be going now, Lyza.</i>

00:40:27.033 --> 00:40:29.839
The... Blaze Reap!

00:40:29.939 --> 00:40:32.043
But why is it here?

00:40:35.684 --> 00:40:38.290
How's that possible?

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:41.296
I was sure the orb-piercer
kicked it away.

00:40:42.932 --> 00:40:44.235
Wait...

00:40:45.604 --> 00:40:47.675
Where am I?

00:40:47.775 --> 00:40:49.412
How did I--

00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:54.756
Riko. N-- Nanachi.

00:40:57.662 --> 00:40:59.566
What?

00:40:59.666 --> 00:41:02.371
What is this thing?

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:06.246
[screaming]

00:41:06.346 --> 00:41:08.483
What's up?
So what you doing there?

00:41:08.584 --> 00:41:11.756
Na-- Uh, Nanachi?

00:41:11.857 --> 00:41:12.792
How did--

00:41:12.892 --> 00:41:14.329
You all right, Reg?

00:41:14.429 --> 00:41:16.566
You were just standing
there staring at a girl's

00:41:16.666 --> 00:41:17.668
pee-stained clothes.

00:41:17.768 --> 00:41:20.641
Huh? Oh, I was?

00:41:20.741 --> 00:41:22.311
No, it's not like that.

00:41:22.979 --> 00:41:24.415
[knowing sigh]

00:41:24.515 --> 00:41:28.123
Nanachi, how'd the
Blaze Reap get over there?

00:41:29.459 --> 00:41:31.062
Hmm?

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:33.100
Oh, great.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:36.172
So you really have
become a piece of junk?

00:41:36.273 --> 00:41:39.312
I guess you have been
through quite a lot.

00:41:39.412 --> 00:41:41.349
But it's time to cheer up.

00:41:41.449 --> 00:41:44.689
And while you're at it, why
don't you wash this for me too?

00:41:49.933 --> 00:41:53.507
Wha-- What did I see?

00:41:53.607 --> 00:41:58.150
<i>If it wasn't this place,</i>
<i>was it somewhere similar?</i>

00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:02.425
<i>And that voice...</i>
<i>If I'm not mistaken,</i>

00:42:03.093 --> 00:42:04.829
<i>that was my voice,</i>

00:42:05.898 --> 00:42:10.240
<i>and my own memories, wasn't it?</i>

00:42:10.341 --> 00:42:14.282
<i>In that case, the one</i>
<i>mourning for Lyza was--</i>

[cooing]

00:42:21.463 --> 00:42:23.967
<i>Was I the one who buried her?</i>

00:42:24.068 --> 00:42:25.571
<i>Can't be.</i>

00:42:25.671 --> 00:42:28.644
<i>Ozen said no one</i>
<i>was buried there.</i>

00:42:30.881 --> 00:42:32.518

00:42:33.387 --> 00:42:36.192
<i>I don't understand any of this.</i>

00:42:39.966 --> 00:42:41.703
[cooing]

00:42:41.803 --> 00:42:43.774
Ah! Stop it!

00:42:43.874 --> 00:42:45.144
Get away from her!

00:42:45.244 --> 00:42:47.715
I said stop it, you--

00:42:47.815 --> 00:42:50.721
[cooing]

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:54.329
-Just relax, little man.
-Huh?

00:42:54.429 --> 00:42:56.967
Mitty would never
attack any humans.

00:42:57.068 --> 00:42:58.470
Oh.

00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:01.543
Though, Mitty doesn't usually
get attached to visitors.

00:43:01.643 --> 00:43:04.949
They're close in age, so
maybe Mitty took a liking.

00:43:05.049 --> 00:43:08.924
Before becoming like this, she
was also a little girl herself.

00:43:09.024 --> 00:43:10.361
Oh.

00:43:10.861 --> 00:43:12.231
Oh.

00:43:15.104 --> 00:43:16.973
Uh, Mitty?

00:43:17.074 --> 00:43:19.145
Just please don't eat
the mushrooms, okay?

00:43:19.245 --> 00:43:22.151
She's not one to ever
treat others so cruelly.

00:43:23.186 --> 00:43:24.689
It was thanks to her,
after all,

00:43:24.789 --> 00:43:26.926
that we got the poison
out so soon.

00:43:27.027 --> 00:43:29.932
Huh? What do you mean by that?

00:43:30.033 --> 00:43:31.736
That medicine we
used on her was made

00:43:31.836 --> 00:43:34.609
by injecting Mitty with
an orb-piercer's poison.

00:43:34.709 --> 00:43:36.212
What? Really?

00:43:36.312 --> 00:43:38.183
Why would you do
something like that?

00:43:38.283 --> 00:43:40.454
She has the ability
to neutralize poisons

00:43:40.554 --> 00:43:42.558
all on her own.
Pretty neat, huh?

00:43:42.658 --> 00:43:43.627
Oh.

00:43:43.727 --> 00:43:45.998
So naturally I decided
to use her blood

00:43:46.099 --> 00:43:47.668
to produce the medicine.

00:43:51.076 --> 00:43:53.613
Nanachi, before all
of this, who exactly

00:43:53.714 --> 00:43:55.818
were you before you
became a Hollow?

00:43:55.918 --> 00:43:57.020
[sigh]

00:43:57.121 --> 00:43:58.924
You really want to ask that?

00:43:59.024 --> 00:44:00.227
It's best that you don't.

00:44:00.327 --> 00:44:02.030
Because if you go
about doing that,

00:44:02.131 --> 00:44:03.700
you're going to want to help us.

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.137
What? Of course I would.

00:44:05.237 --> 00:44:07.541
You saved Riko's
life, after all.

00:44:07.641 --> 00:44:09.044
I would do anything
to help you--

00:44:09.145 --> 00:44:11.149
That will do it.

00:44:11.249 --> 00:44:13.453
Dinner looks to be now done.

00:44:13.553 --> 00:44:17.294
I've made you my specialty,
Netherworld Stew!

00:44:17.395 --> 00:44:18.864
Go on, try some.

00:44:18.964 --> 00:44:21.202
[groaning]

00:44:26.913 --> 00:44:28.316
Here.

00:44:32.625 --> 00:44:35.697
<i>It looks like sticky mud.</i>

00:44:35.798 --> 00:44:37.935
Was this made from
all the ingredients

00:44:38.035 --> 00:44:39.172
I collected earlier?

00:44:39.272 --> 00:44:42.211
Pay no attention to
how it looks, okay?

00:44:42.611 --> 00:44:43.780
[sniffing]

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:45.350
<i>What is that smell?</i>

00:44:45.451 --> 00:44:47.154
<i>It's kind of fishy.</i>

00:44:47.254 --> 00:44:48.356
Don't worry.

00:44:48.457 --> 00:44:49.692
I'll make some more
stew for you, too.

00:44:49.792 --> 00:44:52.198
Then you can munch on
it whenever you want.

00:44:52.298 --> 00:44:54.836
[cooing]

00:45:02.485 --> 00:45:04.522
[gagging]

00:45:05.057 --> 00:45:06.092
<i>Oh, god.</i>

00:45:06.192 --> 00:45:07.194
<i>It's oozing.</i>

00:45:07.294 --> 00:45:09.065
[gagging]

00:45:09.165 --> 00:45:10.734
What the heck is this?

00:45:10.834 --> 00:45:14.275
Was this really made
using those ingredients?

00:45:15.177 --> 00:45:17.782
Do you think it's that bad?

00:45:17.882 --> 00:45:21.389
Nanachi, do you
normally eat like this?

00:45:22.391 --> 00:45:24.328
Well, uh...

00:45:25.497 --> 00:45:27.368
Hey now, quit it.

00:45:27.468 --> 00:45:29.872
Don't you look at me like that.

00:45:29.972 --> 00:45:33.647
Look, I've never gotten a
chance to eat good food before.

00:45:35.083 --> 00:45:37.788
<i>If Riko wakes up and gets</i>
<i>fed this horrible gruel,</i>

00:45:37.888 --> 00:45:39.292
<i>she'll die for sure.</i>

00:45:39.392 --> 00:45:40.527
<i>I've got no choice.</i>

00:45:40.627 --> 00:45:42.231
<i>I have to cook</i>
<i>something myself.</i>

00:45:42.331 --> 00:45:43.600
Well, then.

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.838
If you don't like it,
then just don't eat it.

00:45:45.938 --> 00:45:47.374
[slurping]

00:45:49.212 --> 00:45:50.914
[Nanachi] Oh, I see now.

00:45:51.014 --> 00:45:54.055
So she's looking for her
mother down at the bottom

00:45:54.155 --> 00:45:55.891
of the netherworld, huh?

00:45:55.991 --> 00:45:58.563
We're talking about a
girl with an insatiable

00:45:58.663 --> 00:46:01.302
curiosity, and a piece
of junk who can't

00:46:01.402 --> 00:46:03.740
remember anything important.

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:07.114
It's kind of a miracle that
you've made it this far.

00:46:07.214 --> 00:46:10.420
I should tell you that it does
seem quite hopeless for you.

00:46:10.521 --> 00:46:12.391
[sighing]

00:46:13.727 --> 00:46:19.805
Nanachi, please tell me that you
know of a way to somehow evade

00:46:19.906 --> 00:46:20.941
the Curse of the Abyss.

00:46:21.041 --> 00:46:22.778
You know how, right?

00:46:26.753 --> 00:46:30.294
Why would I explain it to
someone who can't even see it?

00:46:30.394 --> 00:46:32.298
Besides, it's my
personal secret.

00:46:32.398 --> 00:46:34.669
But I beg you!
We need to know!

00:46:34.769 --> 00:46:36.673
Listen, be that as it may, I--

00:46:36.773 --> 00:46:40.080
If it's in my power, I'll do
whatever you want in return.

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:41.583
Just tell me.

00:46:41.683 --> 00:46:43.653
Personal space, please!

00:46:44.255 --> 00:46:45.224
All right.

00:46:45.324 --> 00:46:48.463
Fine then.
Let's give it a shot.

00:46:49.098 --> 00:46:50.868
If that's how you feel.

00:46:50.968 --> 00:46:54.342
I'll make an exception
and let you experience it.

00:46:58.817 --> 00:47:00.787
[twinkling]

00:47:09.004 --> 00:47:10.540
All right!

00:47:14.215 --> 00:47:16.986
Okay. Get under here with me.

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.364
[twinkling]

00:47:25.203 --> 00:47:26.606
What is this thing?

00:47:26.706 --> 00:47:29.345
"Fog Weave,"
a grade-three relic.

00:47:29.445 --> 00:47:32.718
So it's basically just
a thin piece of cloth.

00:47:34.288 --> 00:47:36.559
But it acts pretty
much like this.

00:47:37.127 --> 00:47:38.597
What does?

00:47:39.632 --> 00:47:42.071
The true nature of the
Curse of the Abyss.

00:47:42.171 --> 00:47:44.542
Huh? Wait, how so?

00:47:44.642 --> 00:47:47.881
It's all floaty like this
in the same kind of way,

00:47:47.982 --> 00:47:51.356
with layer upon layer piled on
us like an invisible blanket.

00:47:51.456 --> 00:47:54.962
Even if you poke at it,
you won't see or feel it.

00:47:55.063 --> 00:47:57.968
When we move at all it,
it moves along with us.

00:47:58.069 --> 00:48:00.741
Simply breathing is
enough to alter its flow.

00:48:00.841 --> 00:48:03.480
So then when you
come in contact with it,

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.217
that's when you
get hit by the Curse?

00:48:05.317 --> 00:48:06.953
-That's not it exactly.
-Huh?

00:48:07.054 --> 00:48:11.529
When you touch it, it will
warp, just like this cloth does.

00:48:12.197 --> 00:48:14.235
So then, how come?

00:48:14.335 --> 00:48:16.406
What makes you get
hit with the Curse?

00:48:16.506 --> 00:48:19.178
That would be this.

00:48:19.278 --> 00:48:23.186
[straining]

00:48:23.286 --> 00:48:26.125
See what I'm doing here?

00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:30.167
Once you finally break through,

00:48:30.267 --> 00:48:32.638
the symptoms
hit you all at once.

00:48:32.738 --> 00:48:34.342
If it's something
like your fingertips,

00:48:34.442 --> 00:48:36.145
you'll hardly be affected.

00:48:36.245 --> 00:48:37.915
But if it's your head or
chest,

00:48:38.015 --> 00:48:40.887
or any vital part of you
passes through...

00:48:42.825 --> 00:48:46.733
Well, as you've seen
something seriously not

00:48:46.833 --> 00:48:48.570
good will end up happening.

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:51.743
Whoa. But then what about
whenever you descend?

00:48:51.843 --> 00:48:56.419
Well, passing through it from
above is nice and smooth.

00:48:56.519 --> 00:48:59.592
It's got a flow similar
to inverted thorns which

00:48:59.692 --> 00:49:01.396
won't allow you to leave.

00:49:01.496 --> 00:49:04.869
Look. It's something like this.

00:49:04.969 --> 00:49:07.808
It's just like a trap
for catching prey.

00:49:07.908 --> 00:49:12.184
But what is it, this
malice-filled floaty curse?

00:49:12.284 --> 00:49:13.486
Still don't get it?

00:49:13.586 --> 00:49:15.223
-The force field.
-What?

00:49:15.323 --> 00:49:18.396
The one that carries light
to the subterranean world

00:49:18.496 --> 00:49:20.701
while obstructing
observation of it.

00:49:20.801 --> 00:49:23.940
The one that guards the
order of the netherworld.

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:26.846
The force field lives
and breathes down here,

00:49:26.946 --> 00:49:28.550
filling every
corner of this pit.

00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:31.356
It's the very
blood of the Abyss.

00:49:31.456 --> 00:49:33.893
And that is the true
nature of the Curse.

00:49:33.993 --> 00:49:36.999
There's no where one can
go to escape from it.

00:49:37.568 --> 00:49:38.837
But, Nanachi,

00:49:38.937 --> 00:49:40.374
You said before that the Curse

00:49:40.474 --> 00:49:42.009
wasn't active around
your hideout.

00:49:42.111 --> 00:49:43.546
Hmm.

00:49:43.646 --> 00:49:46.652
I went to great pains to
find this particular location.

00:49:46.753 --> 00:49:48.623
The force field gets
weaker the farther

00:49:48.723 --> 00:49:49.992
you get from the vertical shaft.

00:49:50.093 --> 00:49:52.631
Really?
You mean that's true?

00:49:53.933 --> 00:49:55.537
After descending down this far,

00:49:55.637 --> 00:49:57.641
don't you have
a feel for it yet?

00:49:57.741 --> 00:50:00.113
Well, I guess that there
aren't many places as

00:50:00.213 --> 00:50:01.315
stable as this one.

00:50:01.416 --> 00:50:02.484
Oh, yeah?

00:50:02.584 --> 00:50:04.755
<i>That area around</i>
<i>the Seeker Camp.</i>

00:50:05.323 --> 00:50:07.161
<i>I get it now.</i>

00:50:07.261 --> 00:50:08.897
The force field is sensitive.

00:50:08.997 --> 00:50:11.302
It responds to the
movements of living things.

00:50:11.402 --> 00:50:14.575
It will even alter its flow
to one's consciousness.

00:50:14.675 --> 00:50:16.479
In other words,
if you read minds

00:50:16.579 --> 00:50:17.948
you can predict one's actions.

00:50:18.048 --> 00:50:19.985
[twinkling]

00:50:20.087 --> 00:50:23.493
Orb-piercers aren't
all that intuitive.

00:50:23.593 --> 00:50:25.831
Rather, they just
predict the future.

00:50:25.931 --> 00:50:28.436
The deeper down inside
the pit you are,

00:50:28.536 --> 00:50:30.005
the stronger the force field is.

00:50:30.107 --> 00:50:33.079
So challenging the
netherworld's bottom

00:50:33.179 --> 00:50:36.452
means going down a path
brimming with the deadly Curse

00:50:36.552 --> 00:50:38.356
while also going up
against predators that

00:50:38.456 --> 00:50:40.260
can predict your movements.

00:50:41.562 --> 00:50:44.235
Sounds positively
delightful, huh?

00:50:44.335 --> 00:50:46.506
So how in the world
do cave raiders still

00:50:46.606 --> 00:50:47.908
manage to press on?

00:50:48.008 --> 00:50:49.043
Who knows?

00:50:49.145 --> 00:50:51.983
They aren't even able to
see it, so it's weird.

00:50:52.084 --> 00:50:53.051
Seriously?

00:50:53.153 --> 00:50:56.592
But still, there is
one thing I do know.

00:50:57.427 --> 00:50:58.696
It's just the way they are.

00:50:58.797 --> 00:51:01.001
You can't stop their
longing for this.

00:51:05.076 --> 00:51:06.445
I know.

00:51:06.546 --> 00:51:08.716
Hand me your helmet
there for a second.

00:51:09.451 --> 00:51:10.787
Okay.

00:51:17.668 --> 00:51:19.271
What's that thing?

00:51:19.371 --> 00:51:20.407
Don't you remember?

00:51:20.507 --> 00:51:22.377
I said I'd let
you experience it.

00:51:22.478 --> 00:51:24.615
With that said,
you have to promise

00:51:24.715 --> 00:51:27.387
to do exactly what
I tell you to do.

00:51:38.543 --> 00:51:40.914
-[Nanachi] You hear me?
-Whoa!

00:51:41.014 --> 00:51:42.885
This is unsettling for me.

00:51:42.985 --> 00:51:45.290
It feels like you're right
there next to my ear.

00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:46.526
[Nanachi] <i>Pretty cool, huh?</i>

00:51:46.626 --> 00:51:48.463
<i>It's just something</i>
<i>I picked up.</i>

00:51:48.563 --> 00:51:51.769
[Reg] <i>I can hear your voice,</i>
<i>but where exactly are you?</i>

00:51:51.869 --> 00:51:53.406
Don't worry about it.

00:51:53.506 --> 00:51:55.610
I can see you just fine.

00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:57.781
Now continue going straight.

00:51:57.881 --> 00:51:59.285
<i>Understood.</i>

00:52:03.526 --> 00:52:05.897
[whistle blowing]

00:52:07.401 --> 00:52:08.703
What is that?

00:52:08.803 --> 00:52:12.277
<i>Hey! Don't just rush in</i>
<i>like a lunatic!</i>

00:52:16.285 --> 00:52:18.256
[panting]

00:52:18.356 --> 00:52:19.725
[gasp]

00:52:20.227 --> 00:52:22.097
[growling]

00:52:23.233 --> 00:52:25.070
[tense music]

00:52:29.511 --> 00:52:30.780
It's a child.

00:52:30.881 --> 00:52:32.417
What's going on?

00:52:32.517 --> 00:52:34.121
Do not get any closer.

00:52:34.221 --> 00:52:35.123
You stay away!

00:52:35.223 --> 00:52:36.626
[Nanachi]
<i>That's a Black Whistle.</i>

00:52:36.726 --> 00:52:38.363
<i>Judging by the stuff</i>
<i>he was carrying,</i>

00:52:38.463 --> 00:52:40.433
<i>he was heading back on his own.</i>

00:52:40.533 --> 00:52:41.736
This is perfect.

00:52:41.836 --> 00:52:44.341
Want to try rescuing
our new visitor?

00:52:44.441 --> 00:52:45.710
Yeah. Sounds good to me.

00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:48.249
<i>Hmm. Very well, then.</i>

00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:50.954
[growling]

00:52:51.889 --> 00:52:53.259
What are you doing, boy?

00:52:53.359 --> 00:52:55.430
<i>Listen here now</i>
<i>and don't forget.</i>

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:58.770
<i>No matter what happens,</i>
<i>you do exactly as I say.</i>

00:52:58.870 --> 00:53:01.442
<i>That way you'll be able</i>
<i>to dispose of Orby</i>

00:53:01.542 --> 00:53:02.844
<i>and save the old man.</i>

00:53:02.945 --> 00:53:04.214
<i>Do you understand?</i>

00:53:04.315 --> 00:53:05.283
I'll do as you say.

00:53:05.383 --> 00:53:06.419
<i>Splendid.</i>

00:53:06.519 --> 00:53:08.122
<i>Then I'll show</i>
<i>it to you now,</i>

00:53:08.222 --> 00:53:10.260
<i>the world as I see it</i>
<i>through my eyes.</i>

00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:15.236
First, I want you to look up and
completely commit to the act.

00:53:16.539 --> 00:53:17.808
Are you kidding me?

00:53:17.908 --> 00:53:20.714
<i>Now, listen.</i>
<i>You have to really commit.</i>

00:53:20.814 --> 00:53:22.217
But then I won't be able to--

00:53:22.317 --> 00:53:24.521
Go. Get out of here!

00:53:24.622 --> 00:53:25.957
<i>Don't worry about him.</i>

00:53:26.058 --> 00:53:28.930
<i>Also, stop questioning me.</i>

00:53:29.798 --> 00:53:32.036
Remember to do as I say.

00:53:33.606 --> 00:53:35.243
Got it!

00:53:38.483 --> 00:53:39.585
[roaring]

00:53:39.685 --> 00:53:42.391
Jump hard to the right
right now!

00:53:42.491 --> 00:53:43.826
Irredeemable!

00:53:44.228 --> 00:53:45.497
Huh?

00:53:49.003 --> 00:53:50.507
You have it now.

00:53:50.607 --> 00:53:51.742
Wouldn't let go if I were you.

00:53:51.842 --> 00:53:53.946
-[roaring]
-[screaming]

00:53:54.047 --> 00:53:55.250
<i>That thing you</i>
<i>grabbed is the organ</i>

00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:57.921
<i>it uses to sense</i>
<i>the force field.</i>

00:53:58.690 --> 00:53:59.825
<i>That's its life line,</i>

00:53:59.925 --> 00:54:01.629
<i>and without uncoupling</i>
<i>your actions</i>

00:54:01.729 --> 00:54:04.702
<i>from your conscious mind, you'd</i>
<i>never even be able to touch it.</i>

00:54:04.802 --> 00:54:06.739
[screaming]

00:54:06.839 --> 00:54:09.111
<i>Now that it's confused,</i>
<i>it'll go for the kill</i>

00:54:09.211 --> 00:54:11.415
<i>without any thought</i>
<i>of looking graceful.</i>

00:54:11.515 --> 00:54:12.818
[roaring]

00:54:12.918 --> 00:54:14.955
<i>Now then! Tie it up!</i>

00:54:15.457 --> 00:54:17.394
[grunting]

00:54:21.235 --> 00:54:23.940
Looks like its fate
is now finally sealed.

00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:25.944
<i>Beat it to a pulp.</i>

00:54:28.883 --> 00:54:31.288
You hurt my friend Riko!

00:54:31.389 --> 00:54:33.126
[charging up]

00:54:36.132 --> 00:54:37.567
What?

00:54:38.369 --> 00:54:40.807
[screaming]

00:54:46.719 --> 00:54:48.890
[Reg] <i>It shed its quills!</i>

00:54:49.458 --> 00:54:51.462
[explosion]

00:54:59.078 --> 00:55:01.182
[speechless sigh]

00:55:02.918 --> 00:55:06.058
[Reg] Ugh, there's
so much steam.

00:55:16.946 --> 00:55:19.518
Did-- So did it get away?

00:55:19.618 --> 00:55:21.088
<i>Nicely done.</i>

00:55:21.188 --> 00:55:24.094
<i>It was forced to eject</i>
<i>80 percent of its quills.</i>

00:55:24.194 --> 00:55:26.165
<i>It won't be hunting</i>
<i>here anymore.</i>

00:55:26.265 --> 00:55:29.003
<i>Okay, now hurry up</i>
<i>and get back here.</i>

00:55:37.052 --> 00:55:39.491
<i>No. Don't get too close to him!</i>

00:55:39.591 --> 00:55:42.164
Now that the orb-piercer
is out of the picture,

00:55:42.264 --> 00:55:44.401
it's the cave raiders that
present the most danger

00:55:44.501 --> 00:55:46.338
to us down here.

00:55:46.872 --> 00:55:48.309
<i>Hey!</i>

00:55:49.711 --> 00:55:51.282
What in God's name are you?

00:55:51.382 --> 00:55:53.653
Do you think you could
relay a message for me, sir?

00:55:53.753 --> 00:55:54.721
Huh?

00:55:54.822 --> 00:55:56.325
It's intended for Jiruo.

00:55:56.425 --> 00:55:58.262
He's at the Belchero Orphanage.

00:55:58.362 --> 00:56:01.034
A message for Jiruo at Belchero.

00:56:01.135 --> 00:56:05.276
Would you tell him that we're
continuing our adventure,

00:56:05.376 --> 00:56:06.312
please?

00:56:06.412 --> 00:56:07.714
Uh, okay.

00:56:07.814 --> 00:56:08.816
I can do that.

00:56:08.916 --> 00:56:10.420
I'm counting on you.

00:56:23.946 --> 00:56:25.517
Sorry about that.

00:56:25.617 --> 00:56:29.124
Well, so long as you didn't
tell him about me, I don't mind.

00:56:29.224 --> 00:56:31.095
But you sure it'll be all right?

00:56:31.195 --> 00:56:34.067
Is the person at Belchero
Orphanage trustworthy?

00:56:34.168 --> 00:56:35.970
If people find out
he's connected to you,

00:56:36.071 --> 00:56:37.440
it can make trouble.

00:56:37.974 --> 00:56:39.244
It'll be fine.

00:56:39.344 --> 00:56:41.615
He's the most
dependable guy I know.

00:56:43.051 --> 00:56:45.924
Oh, in any case, that
was pretty incredible.

00:56:46.024 --> 00:56:47.694
Using the opponent's
own special ability

00:56:47.794 --> 00:56:49.364
against it was brilliant.

00:56:49.465 --> 00:56:51.702
I wish we could convince you
to come with us to the bottom

00:56:51.802 --> 00:56:53.473
of the netherworld.

00:56:53.573 --> 00:56:57.714
Actually, I have something
I'd like to ask of you.

00:56:57.814 --> 00:56:59.084
Oh? What is it?

00:56:59.184 --> 00:57:01.222
Ask me anything you want.

00:57:01.322 --> 00:57:02.357
All right.

00:57:02.457 --> 00:57:05.096
This isn't a very easy
thing for me to ask.

00:57:05.196 --> 00:57:07.367
Go ahead. Ask me anything.

00:57:07.467 --> 00:57:09.404
Okay. Here goes.

00:57:09.505 --> 00:57:11.007
Mm-hmm.

00:57:12.042 --> 00:57:15.383
I want you to kill Mitty for me.

00:57:19.958 --> 00:57:21.428
Huh?

00:57:26.105 --> 00:57:28.976
[water falling]

00:57:32.184 --> 00:57:35.089
-[cooing]
-[panting]

00:57:36.792 --> 00:57:38.129
[Nanachi] Mitty.

00:57:38.229 --> 00:57:41.202
I'm sorry for running
away like this,

00:57:41.302 --> 00:57:43.673
but I just can't let
him do it anymore.

00:57:43.773 --> 00:57:45.476
Not as he pleases.

00:57:45.577 --> 00:57:51.422
I... I promise I'll figure
something out for us.

00:57:53.693 --> 00:57:54.862
[Nanachi sighs]

00:57:54.962 --> 00:57:57.400
What is it with this guy?

00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:00.740
He just decides he's going
to sleep for two hours?

00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:02.944
His belly button
looks like it hurts,

00:58:03.044 --> 00:58:05.216
but I don't think
he's been poisoned.

00:58:05.316 --> 00:58:10.326
I guess it must be because
he fired that thing.

00:58:11.795 --> 00:58:13.099
This is it.

00:58:13.199 --> 00:58:16.305
Mitty, I have finally found it.

00:58:22.817 --> 00:58:25.356
[music playing]

00:58:39.418 --> 00:58:41.088
[Nanachi] How nice it'll be...

00:58:41.188 --> 00:58:43.326
Dear Almighty...

00:58:43.426 --> 00:58:49.404
If that's the bottom of this
world, then I would like to go.

00:58:50.206 --> 00:58:52.177
Please, my Lord.

00:58:52.277 --> 00:58:54.548
[chatter]

00:58:57.721 --> 00:59:00.126
[child]
Hey, let's go, guys! Hurry!

00:59:10.546 --> 00:59:11.715
God, you stink.

00:59:11.815 --> 00:59:13.252
Get away from me.

00:59:16.292 --> 00:59:18.496
[child 1] I hear he's a
cave raider from the Abyss.

00:59:18.596 --> 00:59:22.036
[child 2] What's he doing
in a place like this?

00:59:22.137 --> 00:59:24.441
[man] The time is now,
for I believe it

00:59:24.541 --> 00:59:28.149
is a period for a new approach,
free from the influence

00:59:28.249 --> 00:59:29.785
of conventional wisdom.

00:59:29.885 --> 00:59:33.292
Sereny, the chief territory
of the far north...

00:59:33.392 --> 00:59:35.663
I've come here in
search of children

00:59:35.763 --> 00:59:38.769
suitable for forging
a path to the netherworld's

00:59:38.869 --> 00:59:40.740
next era.

00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:43.813
I am known as Bondrewd.

00:59:43.913 --> 00:59:47.821
I am a Cave Raider of the
Abyss, and a White Whistle.

00:59:47.921 --> 00:59:52.397
Brave children who do not
falter at the prospect

00:59:52.497 --> 00:59:54.901
of setting foot
inside the chasm,

00:59:55.002 --> 00:59:58.275
please take a step forward.

01:00:03.652 --> 01:00:05.757
[bells ringing]

01:00:08.629 --> 01:00:11.669
Can't believe I'm
finally here now.

01:00:12.437 --> 01:00:14.174
[boy] You are so annoying.

01:00:14.274 --> 01:00:16.044
Get out of here!

01:00:16.145 --> 01:00:17.647
[girl] Come on, at
least give it a shot.

01:00:17.747 --> 01:00:20.286
I don't hang out with idiots.
Let's go.

01:00:22.724 --> 01:00:26.098
[Nanachi] <i>I guess I'm not</i>
<i>the only one, am I?</i>

01:00:26.198 --> 01:00:27.534
[metal clanking]

01:00:27.634 --> 01:00:30.005
[Bondrewd] Now, everyone,
come and board the vessel.

01:00:30.106 --> 01:00:33.512
Fear not, my children, for
my team of cave raiders

01:00:33.612 --> 01:00:36.418
will escort you throughout
the entire journey.

01:00:36.518 --> 01:00:40.660
Your final destination is
at around 13,000 meters.

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:44.167
In the depths' fifth
layer, the Sea of Corpses,

01:00:44.267 --> 01:00:46.071
lies our operating base,
where we

01:00:46.171 --> 01:00:50.279
will strive to unravel the
mysteries of this world.

01:00:59.831 --> 01:01:02.971
[muffled cranking]

01:01:10.119 --> 01:01:13.092
<i>Ugh, this is so bland.</i>

01:01:13.192 --> 01:01:15.028
Hey there, you.

01:01:15.129 --> 01:01:17.167
What do you want to
be when you grow up?

01:01:17.267 --> 01:01:18.335
A White Whistle, right?

01:01:18.436 --> 01:01:21.108
I, uh...
What are you talking about?

01:01:21.208 --> 01:01:23.011
Being a White Whistle
sure would be great.

01:01:23.112 --> 01:01:25.850
Don't you think we got ourselves
an amazing chance here?

01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:28.456
What-- Whatever you say.

01:01:28.556 --> 01:01:31.895
I was fine with anything, as
long as I could come here.

01:01:31.995 --> 01:01:35.001
Before, I would search through
garbage dumps, picking out

01:01:35.103 --> 01:01:37.273
the least disgusting
stuff to eat.

01:01:37.373 --> 01:01:39.778
Others resorted to
stealing, or ended up

01:01:39.878 --> 01:01:42.650
singing in the streets
begging for food.

01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:46.658
But I never had much
talent for stuff like that.

01:01:46.759 --> 01:01:48.262
[giggle]

01:01:48.362 --> 01:01:50.466
But you do have a talent, right?

01:01:51.802 --> 01:01:55.008
There's nothing but valuable
treasures to get down there.

01:01:55.676 --> 01:01:56.578
Oh.

01:01:56.678 --> 01:01:58.014
And hey, if you're
fine with whatever,

01:01:58.115 --> 01:01:59.885
then we should try
being partners.

01:01:59.985 --> 01:02:01.155
Uh--

01:02:01.255 --> 01:02:04.094
My name is Mitty, a
future White Whistle.

01:02:04.194 --> 01:02:05.663
Who are you?

01:02:07.032 --> 01:02:08.402
I'm Nanachi.

01:02:08.502 --> 01:02:11.408
Woohoo, Nanachi!
[laughing]

01:02:11.508 --> 01:02:13.145
-It's nice to meet you.
-Shh, shh.

01:02:13.245 --> 01:02:15.383
[muffled clanking]

01:02:20.726 --> 01:02:21.795
What's this?

01:02:21.895 --> 01:02:24.401
It says, the "Capital
of the Unreturned."

01:02:24.501 --> 01:02:26.305
You can actually
read nether glyphs?

01:02:26.405 --> 01:02:28.375
From the books I
find in the garbage,

01:02:28.476 --> 01:02:31.047
the ones other people
can't read for themselves.

01:02:32.917 --> 01:02:35.823
The original way to pronounce
nether glyphs has been lost,

01:02:35.923 --> 01:02:38.195
so dictions are used
from our language.

01:02:38.295 --> 01:02:40.031
It's easy, once you
get the hang of it.

01:02:40.132 --> 01:02:41.268
Really?
Will you teach me then?

01:02:41.368 --> 01:02:43.739
[muffled roaring]

01:02:43.839 --> 01:02:45.843
[flapping wings]

01:02:48.249 --> 01:02:49.718
Was that a bird?

01:02:49.818 --> 01:02:52.190
If it happens again,
we'll check it out.

01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:53.726
Oh, okay.

01:02:53.826 --> 01:02:55.563
[laughing]

01:03:02.911 --> 01:03:05.015
[metallic clanking]

01:03:07.954 --> 01:03:09.591
[gasp]

01:03:10.693 --> 01:03:12.230
[Bondrewd] Please be careful.

01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:14.434
If you climb more
than ten meters,

01:03:14.534 --> 01:03:17.874
you'll be hit with the
strains of ascension.

01:03:19.009 --> 01:03:20.413
Come on!

01:03:26.959 --> 01:03:28.729
[Mitty] Whoa.

01:03:30.399 --> 01:03:33.105
[other children exclaiming]

01:03:34.808 --> 01:03:36.445
Look at that.

01:03:39.684 --> 01:03:40.887
Hm?

01:03:42.357 --> 01:03:43.859
[chuckle]

01:03:46.465 --> 01:03:48.135
It'll be all right.

01:03:48.235 --> 01:03:50.172
I-- I suppose.

01:03:50.273 --> 01:03:55.683
[Bondrewd] Now, children,
let me show you to your room.

01:03:55.783 --> 01:03:59.023
[Mitty] So then, what's the
Abyssal Faith about?

01:04:00.293 --> 01:04:02.730
I guess, to put it
simply, when a life is

01:04:02.830 --> 01:04:06.171
lost while down in the Abyss,
the soul is said to return

01:04:06.271 --> 01:04:07.707
to the bottom of the planet.

01:04:07.807 --> 01:04:09.911
And then the soul
changes form and departs

01:04:10.011 --> 01:04:13.085
on a journey to someone who
has wished for a new life...

01:04:13.185 --> 01:04:15.423
or something like that, anyway.

01:04:15.523 --> 01:04:17.961
The very bottom of this
pit is still unknown,

01:04:18.062 --> 01:04:19.764
so it's kind of like God.

01:04:19.864 --> 01:04:22.403
Or maybe it's more like
a source of comfort

01:04:22.503 --> 01:04:24.507
that the cave raiders rely on.

01:04:24.608 --> 01:04:26.545
That's cool.

01:04:27.847 --> 01:04:29.551
[gasp]

01:04:29.651 --> 01:04:31.788
You're pretty remarkable,
you know that?

01:04:31.888 --> 01:04:35.096
That's my awesome partner, for
you! The brains of our team.

01:04:35.196 --> 01:04:36.331
I guess.

01:04:36.431 --> 01:04:38.469
And you're good at drawing too.

01:04:43.312 --> 01:04:46.451
Ilim, please,
come over here.

01:04:46.551 --> 01:04:48.622
Okay, coming.

01:04:50.693 --> 01:04:53.065
[Nanachi] It's Ilim's turn
this time.

01:04:54.968 --> 01:04:57.707
I hope I get to go out
there sometime soon.

01:04:57.807 --> 01:05:01.548
[Mitty] Sure are a lot fewer
of us than when we started.

01:05:01.648 --> 01:05:03.385
In any case, it'd
be great, if we were

01:05:03.485 --> 01:05:04.955
able to go out there together.

01:05:05.056 --> 01:05:06.458
Yeah, I guess.

01:05:06.558 --> 01:05:08.862
[snoring]

01:05:21.355 --> 01:05:23.859
Mitty, wake up.

01:05:25.663 --> 01:05:30.773
Mitty, please, come with me.

01:05:30.873 --> 01:05:32.243
Okay.

01:05:34.447 --> 01:05:37.787
[Bondrewd] After today's
medical checkup, let's go

01:05:37.887 --> 01:05:40.092
for a little stroll outside.

01:05:40.192 --> 01:05:42.497
Bondrewd, take me too.

01:05:42.597 --> 01:05:44.467
Just wait your turn, Nanachi.

01:05:44.567 --> 01:05:46.705
Don't be impatient.

01:06:03.539 --> 01:06:05.109
Mitty?

01:06:05.209 --> 01:06:08.949
[man] Sovereign of Dawn, I
don't understand your reasoning.

01:06:09.049 --> 01:06:12.256
Bringing this many people
down to the fifth layer,

01:06:12.357 --> 01:06:13.792
even children from overseas?

01:06:13.892 --> 01:06:15.830
[Bondrewd] Why are you
bringing this up now?

01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:18.034
It is for this purpose
that I advocated

01:06:18.135 --> 01:06:20.272
to have Black Whistles
enter the fifth layer.

01:06:20.373 --> 01:06:23.078
It's just, it'd be different,
if they were cave raiders.

01:06:23.178 --> 01:06:25.816
But taking children who will
never be able to return,

01:06:25.916 --> 01:06:28.856
given the strain, it's inhumane.

01:06:28.956 --> 01:06:31.695
Ah, then there is
no need to worry,

01:06:31.795 --> 01:06:35.302
for I am not making
use of them as humans.

01:06:35.403 --> 01:06:36.538
I'm sure you understand.

01:06:36.638 --> 01:06:37.707
[gasp]

01:06:37.807 --> 01:06:39.644
[Bondrewd] Care to have a look?

01:06:43.352 --> 01:06:46.625
<i>Mitty. Mitty!</i>

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.662
Mitty!

01:06:57.447 --> 01:06:58.515
Nanachi.

01:06:58.615 --> 01:07:01.788
-[footsteps]
-Mi-- Mitty.

01:07:01.888 --> 01:07:05.629
Well, what have we here?

01:07:10.038 --> 01:07:13.412
What perfect timing
you have, Nanachi.

01:07:13.512 --> 01:07:14.681
Come.

01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:16.852
It's your turn now.

01:07:18.555 --> 01:07:20.926
[ringing]

01:07:24.134 --> 01:07:27.073
That elevator is capable
of quickly going down

01:07:27.173 --> 01:07:30.079
to the depths' sixth
layer just below us.

01:07:30.179 --> 01:07:32.784
Although its destination
is no more than a dead end,

01:07:32.884 --> 01:07:35.956
it's the perfect depth for
testing out a number of things.

01:07:36.057 --> 01:07:39.230
It's my own miniature garden.

01:07:39.330 --> 01:07:40.666
The sixth layer's Curse is

01:07:40.766 --> 01:07:43.872
"death, or loss
of one's humanity,"

01:07:43.972 --> 01:07:45.743
and I'd like to do
something about that.

01:07:45.843 --> 01:07:48.749
The chambers in which you
are currently situated

01:07:48.849 --> 01:07:52.190
are capable of forcing
the Curse all to one side.

01:07:52.290 --> 01:07:54.861
Attempts were made at pairing
a person with a non-human,

01:07:54.961 --> 01:07:57.066
but they were unsuccessful.

01:07:57.166 --> 01:08:00.940
However, Nanachi has
decided to join us.

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:04.280
I do regret having to use
such precious lives as yours,

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.985
but as you two are
such close friends,

01:08:07.086 --> 01:08:08.822
it might make all
the difference.

01:08:08.922 --> 01:08:12.263
So you're telling
us you tricked us?

01:08:12.363 --> 01:08:14.032
Oh, heavens, no.

01:08:14.133 --> 01:08:16.003
The result of all
this will give birth

01:08:16.104 --> 01:08:19.777
to what is needed to drive
the darkness from this chasm,

01:08:19.878 --> 01:08:22.250
and it will be
thanks to all of you.

01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:26.491
Mitty, you will be on the side
to which the Curse is driven.

01:08:26.591 --> 01:08:27.827
Please...

01:08:27.927 --> 01:08:29.697
-do your best to endure it.
-Mitty!

01:08:29.797 --> 01:08:32.336
[Bondrewd] If you die partway
through, your partner

01:08:32.436 --> 01:08:33.505
will be hit with the curse.

01:08:33.605 --> 01:08:35.476
Nanachi.

01:08:35.576 --> 01:08:38.315
Very well. Let's get started.

01:08:39.150 --> 01:08:40.786
[churning]

01:08:49.904 --> 01:08:52.710
[screaming]

01:09:01.461 --> 01:09:02.964
[crash]

01:09:15.256 --> 01:09:17.260
[cooing]

01:09:20.366 --> 01:09:22.470
[numerous cries]

01:09:26.211 --> 01:09:28.615
Nanachi.

01:09:28.715 --> 01:09:31.621
It's all right.
It's going to be all right.

01:09:31.721 --> 01:09:33.692
I promise I'll get through this.

01:09:33.792 --> 01:09:37.066
But if-- if for some
reason, I end up

01:09:37.166 --> 01:09:40.906
not being human
anymore, please,

01:09:41.006 --> 01:09:43.445
let my soul return to you.

01:09:43.545 --> 01:09:45.716
Nanachi, promise me that.

01:09:46.284 --> 01:09:47.620
Mitty!

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:49.357
[loud bang]

01:09:50.326 --> 01:09:52.196
[screaming]

01:09:56.638 --> 01:09:58.809
[rustling sound]

01:10:04.487 --> 01:10:06.291
[Mitty screams]

01:10:08.295 --> 01:10:12.035
[Nanachi] <i>Dear God, please</i>
<i>save us from this.</i>

01:10:12.136 --> 01:10:14.741
-No! Mitty!
<i>-I finally found it.</i>

01:10:14.841 --> 01:10:18.949
<i>I found a treasure</i>
<i>that I hold dear.</i>

01:10:19.049 --> 01:10:22.189
<i>Please, please don't</i>
<i>take her away from me.</i>

01:10:22.290 --> 01:10:24.160
[screaming]

01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:26.231
[sloshing]

01:10:29.437 --> 01:10:31.341
Kill me!

01:10:43.565 --> 01:10:45.135
Ah...

01:10:46.504 --> 01:10:49.143
My, my, how very interesting.

01:10:50.379 --> 01:10:52.015
Isn't this splendid?

01:10:53.719 --> 01:10:56.458
The two of you are
truly magnificent.

01:11:01.768 --> 01:11:03.939
[screaming]

01:11:06.111 --> 01:11:07.880
[Bondrewd] Nanachi.

01:11:08.281 --> 01:11:09.717
Nanachi.

01:11:09.817 --> 01:11:12.156
As usual, I see you're
doodling, instead

01:11:12.256 --> 01:11:14.327
of assisting with the research.

01:11:14.427 --> 01:11:17.266
But you sure are
adorable, aren't you?

01:11:17.633 --> 01:11:18.902
Oh, yes.

01:11:19.002 --> 01:11:21.975
I now understand the
"curse" that Mitty received.

01:11:22.076 --> 01:11:24.380
It's quite a glorious result.

01:11:25.549 --> 01:11:28.522
For it to produce such
a surprising byproduct,

01:11:28.622 --> 01:11:31.161
the Abyss truly is astonishing.

01:11:31.261 --> 01:11:34.967
The Curse, which she so
bravely received twofold,

01:11:35.069 --> 01:11:38.308
did more than just cause
her to lose her humanity.

01:11:38.408 --> 01:11:41.247
It also made her
incapable of dying.

01:11:41.347 --> 01:11:42.583
[gasp]

01:11:49.464 --> 01:11:50.899
[weak cooing]

01:11:50.999 --> 01:11:53.271
Please have a look.

01:11:53.372 --> 01:11:55.909
Her limbs, which should have
been completely crushed,

01:11:56.009 --> 01:11:57.613
have begun to grow back.

01:11:57.713 --> 01:12:01.254
This is now the ninth time
she's been resurrected.

01:12:01.354 --> 01:12:05.863
The only change is that her form
becomes slightly more distorted.

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:09.437
[sobbing]

01:12:10.806 --> 01:12:12.710
[wind howling]

01:12:12.810 --> 01:12:15.149
[straining]

01:12:18.989 --> 01:12:22.663
Mitty, I'm sorry for
running away like this,

01:12:22.763 --> 01:12:27.706
but I just can't let him do
it anymore, not as he pleases.

01:12:27.807 --> 01:12:33.285
I... I promise I'll figure
something out for us.

01:12:44.941 --> 01:12:46.578
Look here, Mitty.

01:12:46.678 --> 01:12:48.915
It's a bird.
You remember.

01:12:49.015 --> 01:12:51.387
It's the same one that was
screeching at us before.

01:12:51.488 --> 01:12:53.925
[cooing]

01:12:59.170 --> 01:13:02.243
Not to your liking, Mitty?

01:13:05.415 --> 01:13:07.419
[weak groaning]

01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:10.526
It's no use.

01:13:10.626 --> 01:13:13.732
No matter what I try,
she just suffers.

01:13:13.832 --> 01:13:16.070
[labored breathing]

01:13:18.475 --> 01:13:20.946
Sorry you stayed
alive for nothing.

01:13:21.046 --> 01:13:23.618
I... I'll end you misery now.

01:13:23.718 --> 01:13:25.689
[cooing]

01:13:27.259 --> 01:13:30.098
I'll keep searching
for it, a way

01:13:30.199 --> 01:13:33.605
to kill Mitty without making
her suffer through life anymore.

01:13:36.511 --> 01:13:40.252
<i>There must be something</i>
<i>out there somewhere.</i>

01:13:40.919 --> 01:13:42.590
<i>There has to be.</i>

01:13:48.702 --> 01:13:52.843
It's the Sparagmos, the light
which can send one beyond.

01:13:52.943 --> 01:13:56.016
There was a certain relic he
was constantly talking about.

01:13:56.117 --> 01:13:58.421
One of Mitty's eyes
was destroyed by it,

01:13:58.522 --> 01:14:01.594
and that's the only part of
her that doesn't regenerate.

01:14:01.694 --> 01:14:06.271
Anything it hits disappears, as
if it's been completely undone.

01:14:06.371 --> 01:14:08.975
Afterwards, the air
burns up to nothing.

01:14:09.777 --> 01:14:11.548
It's like my Incinerator.

01:14:11.648 --> 01:14:14.587
If you were to use it,
well, then MItty--

01:14:14.687 --> 01:14:16.057
Hold on.

01:14:16.824 --> 01:14:19.964
But, uh, are you certain?

01:14:20.065 --> 01:14:24.005
I mean, are you sure Mitty has
truly lost all over humanity?

01:14:24.106 --> 01:14:26.244
She responds to being
called, and she can--

01:14:26.344 --> 01:14:28.148
Those are just reflexes.

01:14:28.248 --> 01:14:29.517
No matter what I have tried,

01:14:29.617 --> 01:14:32.423
real interaction
has proven impossible.

01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:37.099
And there's her eye.

01:14:37.199 --> 01:14:40.205
[somber music]

01:14:40.305 --> 01:14:41.908
I'm sure you've seen it.

01:14:42.008 --> 01:14:43.879
How could you not?

01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:47.051
Even now, I have a
feeling that Mitty's soul

01:14:47.152 --> 01:14:49.557
is imprisoned within that body.

01:14:55.736 --> 01:14:57.706
Forgive me.

01:14:57.806 --> 01:15:00.145
I need some time to think.

01:15:01.648 --> 01:15:03.218
Okay.

01:15:03.318 --> 01:15:05.322
I can understand that.

01:15:08.395 --> 01:15:09.497
Nanachi?

01:15:09.597 --> 01:15:11.301
I'm sorry, Reg.

01:15:11.401 --> 01:15:14.540
I shouldn't have sprung
something like that on you.

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:15.475
Don't worry.

01:15:15.576 --> 01:15:18.214
I'll still treat
Riko either way.

01:15:18.315 --> 01:15:22.856
That girl, Mitty's really
taken a liking to her.

01:15:22.957 --> 01:15:26.164
[Reg] <i>I thought of you as being</i>
<i>so strong and steadfast,</i>

01:15:26.264 --> 01:15:29.437
<i>but just now, you</i>
<i>seemed so fragile.</i>

01:15:29.537 --> 01:15:32.443
<i>The vast amount</i>
<i>of medicines here</i>

01:15:32.543 --> 01:15:35.349
<i>and the poisons, all of</i>
<i>them are for the purpose</i>

01:15:35.449 --> 01:15:37.953
<i>of trying to restore</i>
<i>Mitty's dignity.</i>

01:15:38.053 --> 01:15:41.628
<i>In that case, if that is</i>
<i>your reason for living,</i>

01:15:41.728 --> 01:15:47.005
<i>after I've killed Mitty,</i>
<i>then what?</i>

01:15:47.106 --> 01:15:49.310
<i>What will become of you?</i>

01:15:58.895 --> 01:16:01.768
[cooing]

01:16:15.027 --> 01:16:15.996
[pained grunt]

01:16:16.097 --> 01:16:17.299
Time to perk up.

01:16:17.399 --> 01:16:19.870
How long are you
going to be so mopey?

01:16:20.839 --> 01:16:22.242
You need some good food.

01:16:22.343 --> 01:16:25.248
I'll make you something
really hearty to eat tonight.

01:16:25.349 --> 01:16:27.519
How about some shroombear meat?

01:16:28.755 --> 01:16:31.127
<i>Not another one of</i>
<i>Nanachi's dishes.</i>

01:16:31.227 --> 01:16:34.333
Hey, Nanachi, let me
try cooking dinner.

01:16:36.137 --> 01:16:38.108
<i>From what I've seen so far,</i>

01:16:38.208 --> 01:16:40.879
<i>Nanachi mixes everything</i>
<i>way too much.</i>

01:16:40.979 --> 01:16:42.649
<i>I must enhance the ingredients.</i>

01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:45.889
You know, you're not very good
at skinning that poor thing.

01:16:45.989 --> 01:16:46.991
Do you want some help?

01:16:47.092 --> 01:16:49.130
Just go and take
a seat, will you?

01:16:51.234 --> 01:16:55.542
<i>This meat is really quite</i>
<i>dark, and it stinks too.</i>

01:16:55.642 --> 01:17:00.485
If I remember correctly,
Riko did something like this.

01:17:02.656 --> 01:17:05.829
What the-- were the innards
supposed to come out first?

01:17:05.929 --> 01:17:09.035
Ah! Something ripped off!

01:17:09.136 --> 01:17:11.641
This here, am I
supposed to rinse it?

01:17:11.741 --> 01:17:13.578
[Nanachi sighs]

01:17:16.651 --> 01:17:20.492
Um, doesn't this stuff
smell, like, super bad to you?

01:17:28.308 --> 01:17:31.881
God! This is far worse than
anything I ever made.

01:17:38.628 --> 01:17:40.866
[gagging]
<i>Gross!</i>

01:17:40.966 --> 01:17:45.007
<i>The taste of excrement</i>
<i>is filling up my mouth!</i>

01:17:45.108 --> 01:17:46.778
It's okay. Go ahead.

01:17:46.878 --> 01:17:49.283
You can call it
irredeemable, if you like.

01:17:49.383 --> 01:17:50.919
<i>It's irredeemable!</i>

01:17:57.566 --> 01:17:59.170
[Nanachi] Before
they know it,

01:17:59.270 --> 01:18:01.074
the shooting stone
leaves a trail.

01:18:01.174 --> 01:18:05.315
Watching as it falls down
as red-hot iron rain,

01:18:05.415 --> 01:18:08.455
the ice-covered trees
proceed, transforming

01:18:08.555 --> 01:18:10.625
into frosty clouds.

01:18:10.725 --> 01:18:13.465
In the gap in the sky,
a large turtle

01:18:13.565 --> 01:18:16.604
with its neck
stretched out gazed

01:18:16.704 --> 01:18:18.875
into the emptiness
that spread before it

01:18:18.975 --> 01:18:21.247
to the ends of imagination.

01:18:24.954 --> 01:18:27.459
[sloshing]

01:18:36.944 --> 01:18:39.316
[soft music]

01:18:40.519 --> 01:18:43.458
<i>She wants me to kill</i>
<i>her friend.</i>

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:45.929
<i>It's been a while,</i>

01:18:46.029 --> 01:18:49.370
<i>and Nanachi hasn't approached</i>
<i>me about it again.</i>

01:18:52.576 --> 01:18:55.949
<i>Is it okay</i>
<i>to leave it like this?</i>

01:19:10.779 --> 01:19:14.653
Would you allow me
to ask you something?

01:19:14.753 --> 01:19:18.328
Do you know if Mitty
is truly unhappy here?

01:19:18.428 --> 01:19:20.232
Personally, I don't
really think--

01:19:20.332 --> 01:19:22.269
I know where you're trying
to go with this, Reg.

01:19:22.369 --> 01:19:24.673
You're thinking she
seems to be so peaceful,

01:19:24.773 --> 01:19:27.913
wondering if it's necessary
to have to kill her, right?

01:19:35.195 --> 01:19:39.503
[Nanachi] Look, someday
I'm going to die, of course.

01:19:39.603 --> 01:19:43.178
And when that happens,
you understand

01:19:43.278 --> 01:19:45.615
Mitty will be alone forever.

01:19:46.951 --> 01:19:48.388
Can you imagine?

01:19:48.488 --> 01:19:51.394
Mitty never eats, and
she still doesn't die.

01:19:51.494 --> 01:19:54.266
But if she gets
stabbed, it hurts.

01:19:54.366 --> 01:19:56.637
And she even sheds
tears of pain.

01:19:56.737 --> 01:19:58.741
Even if those are, in
fact, mere reflexes,

01:19:58.841 --> 01:20:02.583
she'd still be forced to endure
her endless suffering forever.

01:20:02.683 --> 01:20:05.856
She's not even capable
of screaming out.

01:20:05.956 --> 01:20:10.030
Her soul would just remain
imprisoned for all eternity.

01:20:11.567 --> 01:20:14.673
Reg, this is my last
chance to end her pain.

01:20:14.773 --> 01:20:17.512
You have the power
to set her free.

01:20:17.613 --> 01:20:19.483
It's now or never.

01:20:19.917 --> 01:20:21.621
Please, Reg.

01:20:21.721 --> 01:20:23.591
I'm afraid an
opportunity like this

01:20:23.691 --> 01:20:26.063
won't ever present itself again.

01:20:27.399 --> 01:20:29.637
[Reg] I understand.

01:20:29.737 --> 01:20:32.910
Nanachi, promise me this.

01:20:33.010 --> 01:20:35.415
If Mitty isn't around
anymore, promise me

01:20:35.515 --> 01:20:37.686
you want to take your own life.

01:20:39.423 --> 01:20:40.525
Don't worry.

01:20:40.625 --> 01:20:42.996
I mean, I got to look
after Riko, right?

01:20:43.097 --> 01:20:45.602
Even after you're
done treating Riko!

01:20:48.708 --> 01:20:52.783
Nnaa, you don't
have to be so mean.

01:21:01.067 --> 01:21:02.369
But I understand.

01:21:02.469 --> 01:21:04.440
I promise.

01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:07.879
Well, then you can
leave it to me.

01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:12.389
With all of the strength I
have, I will send her off.

01:21:13.625 --> 01:21:16.130
[Reg sobbing]

01:21:28.321 --> 01:21:30.525
[cooing]

01:21:34.566 --> 01:21:36.103
[Nanachi] All right.

01:21:37.873 --> 01:21:41.547
Sorry to make you stick
around for all this time.

01:21:41.647 --> 01:21:44.687
It won't be long
until we meet again.

01:21:53.271 --> 01:21:55.108
Okay, it's time.

01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:04.994
[whimpering]

01:22:13.144 --> 01:22:14.747
[charging up]

01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:21.927
Stop it!

01:22:22.028 --> 01:22:22.863
[gasp]

01:22:22.963 --> 01:22:23.831
[powering down]

01:22:23.931 --> 01:22:25.301
Mitty!

01:22:25.402 --> 01:22:27.606
I'm so sorry, Mitty!
I was wrong!

01:22:27.706 --> 01:22:29.042
I should have tried more!

01:22:29.143 --> 01:22:32.716
Mitty, I'm so, so sorry!

01:22:33.551 --> 01:22:34.653
Listen to me.

01:22:34.753 --> 01:22:37.592
We'll always be together, okay?

01:22:41.534 --> 01:22:44.640
My sweet Mitty,
you feel so warm.

01:22:45.775 --> 01:22:48.748
Mitty, thank you.

01:22:55.628 --> 01:22:57.632
[sniffling]

01:23:05.882 --> 01:23:09.156
Okay, I'm ready now.

01:23:09.890 --> 01:23:12.729
[soft solemn music]

01:23:16.437 --> 01:23:18.708
[cooing]

01:23:23.584 --> 01:23:25.655
[explosion]

01:23:33.204 --> 01:23:35.575
[cooing]

01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:53.911
[echoing blast]

01:23:55.381 --> 01:23:57.219
[panting]

01:24:08.207 --> 01:24:09.710
Mitty.

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.951
[crying]

01:24:24.573 --> 01:24:26.443
Mitty!

01:24:26.544 --> 01:24:30.418
You'll always be my treasure!

01:24:30.518 --> 01:24:32.656
[sobbing]

01:24:42.309 --> 01:24:44.847
No, leave me alone!

01:24:46.383 --> 01:24:48.621
[both sobbing]

01:24:58.741 --> 01:25:00.411
[fire crackling]

01:25:03.351 --> 01:25:04.386
[Lyza] Come on.

01:25:04.486 --> 01:25:06.857
This is no time
for feeling down.

01:25:08.026 --> 01:25:11.534
[Reg] <i>But, why am I so sad?</i>

01:25:11.634 --> 01:25:14.072
Please, you need to eat.

01:25:15.141 --> 01:25:16.777
[sniffing]

01:25:18.848 --> 01:25:20.585
<i>That smells so good.</i>

01:25:20.685 --> 01:25:23.357
Once you finish your
food, we'll head out.

01:25:28.534 --> 01:25:29.870
[sniffing]

01:25:29.970 --> 01:25:32.409
<i>That's strange.</i>
<i>What's that smell?</i>

01:25:32.509 --> 01:25:34.045
[Nanachi] Naa...

01:25:34.146 --> 01:25:37.452
You're adapting way better than
I could have ever imagined.

01:25:37.552 --> 01:25:39.690
[Riko] You're good
at this, Nanachi.

01:25:41.727 --> 01:25:44.099
[Nanachi] Well, is that
all right with you?

01:25:45.468 --> 01:25:46.804
Well?

01:25:49.509 --> 01:25:51.547
[gleeful gasp]

01:25:51.647 --> 01:25:53.985
Wait! Try to take it easy now.

01:26:00.198 --> 01:26:01.433
Hey, Reg.

01:26:01.533 --> 01:26:03.137
Good morning.

01:26:05.007 --> 01:26:07.879
Good morning, Riko.

01:26:09.015 --> 01:26:10.551
[Nanachi] Since she's still
recovering, I thought

01:26:10.652 --> 01:26:13.457
I would make her a a stew
that's simple and easy to eat,

01:26:13.558 --> 01:26:16.230
but she kept correcting all
the ways I was making it.

01:26:16.330 --> 01:26:18.868
<i>So that must have done</i>
<i>with that smell was.</i>

01:26:18.968 --> 01:26:20.572
[Nanachi] But if you remove
the entrails, it's

01:26:20.672 --> 01:26:22.041
going to taste bland, right?

01:26:22.142 --> 01:26:24.045
[Riko] I promise it'll be fine.

01:26:24.146 --> 01:26:26.951
I didn't know demonfish also
inhabit the fourth layer.

01:26:27.786 --> 01:26:29.122
That's looking real good.

01:26:29.222 --> 01:26:31.427
Now, you carefully
take the innards out.

01:26:31.527 --> 01:26:33.064
That's it.
You're doing great!

01:26:33.164 --> 01:26:35.101
Oh my gosh,
you're so fluffy!

01:26:35.201 --> 01:26:38.574
Why are you just standing there?
Help me out here.

01:26:38.674 --> 01:26:42.115
She's been acting like this
ever since she first saw me.

01:26:42.215 --> 01:26:44.720
Don't look at me like
you want to cuddle too.

01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:47.024
Yeah, well, you
don't seem to hate it

01:26:47.125 --> 01:26:48.694
as much as whenever I do it.

01:26:48.794 --> 01:26:50.131
Well, yeah!

01:26:50.231 --> 01:26:53.738
When you do it, it feels
all creepy for some reason!

01:26:53.838 --> 01:26:56.176
[playful music]

01:27:01.487 --> 01:27:05.194
Well, the bottom line
is the taste, isn't it?

01:27:10.104 --> 01:27:11.440
[gasp]

01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:14.413
[squealing]

01:27:30.845 --> 01:27:33.384
[moaning]

01:27:33.484 --> 01:27:35.020
Do you like it?

01:27:35.922 --> 01:27:38.861
Well, I guess it was all right.

01:27:38.961 --> 01:27:39.963
Not half bad.

01:27:40.064 --> 01:27:41.400
I'm so glad to hear that.

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:43.938
I could not have done it
without all your help.

01:27:44.038 --> 01:27:45.608
And the eggs are
pretty delicious too.

01:27:45.708 --> 01:27:47.445
Give it a try.

01:27:53.124 --> 01:27:56.230
Hey, wasn't there someone
else who lived here too?

01:27:57.332 --> 01:27:58.834
[gasp]

01:28:01.874 --> 01:28:04.079
Hm? Hm?

01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:07.519
How would you know that?

01:28:07.619 --> 01:28:09.890
Huh? Um...

01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:12.495
Not even sure why
I thought of that.

01:28:12.595 --> 01:28:13.597
Oh!

01:28:13.698 --> 01:28:15.568
That's right.

01:28:15.668 --> 01:28:19.509
Well, you see, I kept having
this terrifying, scary dream.

01:28:22.816 --> 01:28:24.519
I can't remember
how it all went,

01:28:24.619 --> 01:28:27.692
but what I do remember...

01:28:27.792 --> 01:28:29.863
is finding myself trapped

01:28:29.963 --> 01:28:32.369
inside this pitch-black
boulder-like thing.

01:28:32.469 --> 01:28:36.143
It was horribly heavy and
wouldn't budge at all.

01:28:36.243 --> 01:28:38.481
At first, there was
this cavity inside it

01:28:38.581 --> 01:28:41.320
that was about the
same size as me,

01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:45.194
but then it kept getting
smaller and smaller.

01:28:45.294 --> 01:28:47.899
It was painful and agonizing.

01:28:50.471 --> 01:28:52.342
I was lost.

01:28:52.442 --> 01:28:55.381
I didn't know or understand
what I was anymore.

01:28:55.481 --> 01:28:56.650
[crying]

01:28:56.750 --> 01:28:59.256
I even forgot how to speak.

01:28:59.356 --> 01:29:02.595
I was so scared,
I just kept crying.

01:29:02.695 --> 01:29:04.266
[another crying]

01:29:05.501 --> 01:29:08.574
And I heard more crying,
but not from me.

01:29:08.674 --> 01:29:11.313
It was coming from someone else.

01:29:12.315 --> 01:29:15.088
At first, it kind of scared me.

01:29:15.188 --> 01:29:17.725
Then I realized that
it was another girl.

01:29:17.826 --> 01:29:19.996
She was afraid too.

01:29:20.098 --> 01:29:23.070
It helped ease my mind,
just a little.

01:29:23.170 --> 01:29:26.577
So we just stayed like
that for quite a while.

01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:30.251
Whenever I got scared,
there was that girl

01:29:30.351 --> 01:29:33.624
in front of me, who was even
more frightened than I was.

01:29:33.724 --> 01:29:35.628
I couldn't speak,
but with my eyes,

01:29:35.728 --> 01:29:38.667
I kept on telling her that
it was going to be all right.

01:29:42.075 --> 01:29:44.146
Then I smelled
something like smoke,

01:29:44.246 --> 01:29:46.550
and the crying finally stopped.

01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:56.270
And, well, that girl left
without ever looking back.

01:29:56.370 --> 01:29:59.242
But when I looked
at her, she was just

01:29:59.342 --> 01:30:01.880
like all of the other
cave raiders I've seen.

01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:05.087
Her eye was filled with
an insatiable longing.

01:30:05.188 --> 01:30:07.358
And just like that,

01:30:07.459 --> 01:30:10.965
I remembered what I always
wanted to be one day.

01:30:14.406 --> 01:30:19.082
So I thought,
"I need to get going."

01:30:21.787 --> 01:30:24.259
And right about
then I had a feeling

01:30:24.359 --> 01:30:27.165
that I would someday
see that girl again.

01:30:27.265 --> 01:30:29.302
And then I just
woke up, you know?

01:30:33.644 --> 01:30:36.216
Nanachi, Riko once--

01:30:36.316 --> 01:30:39.189
Riko died when she
was a baby, but, uh...

01:30:39.289 --> 01:30:41.827
she was brought back to life
by the power of a relic.

01:30:41.927 --> 01:30:45.201
You see, Riko's life
as we know it may

01:30:45.301 --> 01:30:47.372
very well be tied to the Abyss.

01:30:47.472 --> 01:30:49.075
Thanks, Reg.

01:30:49.176 --> 01:30:50.611
It's all right.

01:30:52.415 --> 01:30:54.719
I'm heading out to
fetch some water.

01:30:56.456 --> 01:30:59.629
This time, you need to make sure
you can really protect Riko,

01:30:59.729 --> 01:31:01.133
okay?

01:31:08.012 --> 01:31:11.520
[Reg] Riko, the truth is...

01:31:17.832 --> 01:31:19.202
Here we are.

01:31:19.302 --> 01:31:21.306
I come to this place
whenever I'm injured.

01:31:21.406 --> 01:31:23.477
Oh, wow!

01:31:23.577 --> 01:31:26.183
Strange beasts that I've
never seen anywhere else

01:31:26.283 --> 01:31:27.752
tend to make their way here.

01:31:27.852 --> 01:31:29.222
[Reg] You sure
this place is safe?

01:31:29.322 --> 01:31:32.528
[Nanachi] They're so docile,
you can even pet them.

01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:35.902
The deeper spots can cause some
overstimulation, so be careful.

01:31:36.002 --> 01:31:37.171
[Riko] Okay.

01:31:37.272 --> 01:31:39.376
[Reg] There's light
coming from below.

01:31:42.148 --> 01:31:43.817
[sniffing]

01:31:43.918 --> 01:31:45.454
I can't get this off by myself.

01:31:45.554 --> 01:31:47.659
Would you mind helping
me with it, Reg?

01:31:48.627 --> 01:31:49.563
[stammering]

01:31:49.663 --> 01:31:51.333
Well, okay.

01:31:51.433 --> 01:31:53.771
Riko, lift your arm a bit.

01:31:57.245 --> 01:32:00.117
Reg, do you want
to go in with me?

01:32:00.217 --> 01:32:02.622
I'm just going
keep a lookout, okay?

01:32:02.722 --> 01:32:04.326
You should go on and get in.

01:32:04.426 --> 01:32:07.599
Sometimes blood-sucking
insects come to have a bite.

01:32:07.699 --> 01:32:09.970
You'll be much better
off in the water.

01:32:10.071 --> 01:32:12.809
I think I'll be taking
on lookout duty.

01:32:16.783 --> 01:32:18.621
[Riko] It's so warm!

01:32:19.656 --> 01:32:21.827
The bottom seems pretty
slippery over here.

01:32:21.927 --> 01:32:23.297
[Reg] Be careful.

01:32:23.397 --> 01:32:25.968
Whoa, wherever we go, the
color dissipates around us.

01:32:26.069 --> 01:32:27.338
Reg, lookie here.

01:32:27.438 --> 01:32:28.474
Even though
the water's hot,

01:32:28.574 --> 01:32:30.211
there's a bunch
of little fish.

01:32:30.311 --> 01:32:32.315
[giggling]

01:32:32.415 --> 01:32:35.288
Ew, they're eating the dead
skin that's floating up.

01:32:35.388 --> 01:32:39.763
[Reg] <i>For some reason,</i>
<i>I'm feeling thirsty.</i>

01:32:39.863 --> 01:32:41.800
-Ow!
-Riko?

01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:43.504
Ouch.

01:32:43.604 --> 01:32:44.472
I'll be okay.

01:32:44.572 --> 01:32:46.543
The hot water
just stings a bit.

01:32:46.643 --> 01:32:47.812
Huh?

01:32:49.215 --> 01:32:51.486
-Reg?
-Hm?

01:32:51.586 --> 01:32:53.524
What's up with your penis?

01:32:55.061 --> 01:32:56.596
[gasp]

01:32:57.732 --> 01:32:59.169
Ah!

01:33:00.338 --> 01:33:01.440
I don't know.

01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:04.279
This-- This is irredeemable.

01:33:04.379 --> 01:33:06.917
Oh, geez. What's with you two?

01:33:07.017 --> 01:33:09.723
You're so uncomfortable with
how you feel about each other.

01:33:09.823 --> 01:33:12.595
Come on, Reg.
Why are you being so silly?

01:33:12.695 --> 01:33:15.000
You know you've
already smooched.

01:33:15.101 --> 01:33:16.636
No point in being
embarrassed now.

01:33:16.737 --> 01:33:19.275
Um, what smooch is
she talking about?

01:33:19.376 --> 01:33:20.911
Yeah, that was a--

01:33:21.012 --> 01:33:23.217
that could hardly
be called a smooch.

01:33:23.317 --> 01:33:24.786
What's the matter, Nanachi?

01:33:24.886 --> 01:33:26.757
Come and get in here with us!

01:33:26.857 --> 01:33:29.062
[Nanachi] Don't try to
change the subject.

01:33:29.162 --> 01:33:32.335
Besides, I'm on lookout
duty, so take your time.

01:33:32.435 --> 01:33:35.174
Come on, what's this
about a smooch, huh?

01:33:35.274 --> 01:33:38.480
Come on, Reg. Reg!

01:33:38.580 --> 01:33:39.783
So pathetic.

01:33:39.883 --> 01:33:41.653
Can't bear to watch this.

01:33:41.753 --> 01:33:43.223
[chuckle]

01:33:43.323 --> 01:33:45.795
<i>Mitty, thank you.</i>

01:33:45.895 --> 01:33:50.304
<i>Thank you for pulling Reg's</i>
<i>treasure away from that place.</i>

01:33:51.673 --> 01:33:54.212
A bit longer...

01:33:54.312 --> 01:33:57.385
I hope you can wait for
me just a bit longer.

01:34:02.829 --> 01:34:04.733
[sloshing]

01:34:05.334 --> 01:34:07.872
[whimpering]

01:34:10.411 --> 01:34:11.813
Riko, hang in there.

01:34:11.913 --> 01:34:14.319
-[muffled screaming]
-[Nanachi sighs]

01:34:14.419 --> 01:34:16.490
Five more left.

01:34:16.590 --> 01:34:19.963
The big central one comes
next, so hold her tight.

01:34:21.967 --> 01:34:24.305
[screaming]

01:34:35.261 --> 01:34:37.565
[straining]

01:34:46.917 --> 01:34:48.253
<i>It moved.</i>

01:34:48.353 --> 01:34:51.593
<i>Even if it's just</i>
<i>the thumb, it moved.</i>

01:34:52.061 --> 01:34:53.764
Riko.

01:34:53.864 --> 01:34:55.167
Hey, Reg.

01:34:55.267 --> 01:34:56.937
What's the matter?

01:34:57.037 --> 01:34:58.307
I'm sorry.

01:34:58.407 --> 01:35:01.079
I'm sorry I mangled
up your arm so badly.

01:35:01.179 --> 01:35:02.815
It's my fault.

01:35:03.784 --> 01:35:04.719
Listen,

01:35:04.819 --> 01:35:07.058
I'm the one who
asked you to do it.

01:35:07.158 --> 01:35:08.460
Yeah, but...

01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:12.535
but in the end, it was
Nanachi who saved you.

01:35:16.409 --> 01:35:20.384
Nanachi told me that, while
you were trying to save me,

01:35:20.484 --> 01:35:21.720
you were crying the whole time,

01:35:21.820 --> 01:35:24.359
and that you were
worried sick about me.

01:35:24.459 --> 01:35:28.233
And seeing you like that brought
back memories for Nanachi.

01:35:28.333 --> 01:35:31.038
That's why Nanachi chose
to rush over to help us.

01:35:38.253 --> 01:35:40.858
Reg, you see this scar?

01:35:40.958 --> 01:35:42.562
It's proof.

01:35:42.662 --> 01:35:45.968
The precious proof
that you protected me,

01:35:46.069 --> 01:35:48.574
and I will always treasure it.

01:35:48.674 --> 01:35:49.776
Riko...

01:35:52.248 --> 01:35:53.684
Nanachi?

01:35:55.588 --> 01:35:57.058
[Reg] What's wrong?

01:35:57.158 --> 01:35:59.128
Well, never mind.

01:35:59.229 --> 01:36:00.798
It's nothing really.

01:36:04.272 --> 01:36:06.041
Hey, Nanachi.

01:36:06.142 --> 01:36:07.111
Yeah?

01:36:07.211 --> 01:36:09.249
I want to ask you something.

01:36:09.349 --> 01:36:12.488
Would you ever consider
maybe coming with us?

01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:23.177
Okay.

01:36:23.277 --> 01:36:24.245
Really?

01:36:24.345 --> 01:36:26.116
That makes me so happy!

01:36:26.216 --> 01:36:27.351
You sure? Positive?

01:36:27.451 --> 01:36:29.956
-I'm sure.
-[footsteps]

01:36:30.057 --> 01:36:32.361
Nanachi!

01:36:32.461 --> 01:36:34.465
Get off of me,
you piece of junk!

01:36:34.566 --> 01:36:36.469
[laughing]

01:36:36.570 --> 01:36:40.744
Yeah, well, Mitty did take a
real shine to you, after all.

01:36:40.844 --> 01:36:44.552
If I abandoned you now, she'd
be mad at you next time we meet,

01:36:44.652 --> 01:36:46.990
especially since I
can't rely on Reg.

01:36:47.091 --> 01:36:48.327
I guess that's fair.

01:36:48.427 --> 01:36:50.798
And don't forget, Riko's
cooking is really good.

01:36:52.235 --> 01:36:53.437
What was that?

01:36:53.537 --> 01:36:56.710
In due time, I'll tell
you the whole story.

01:36:56.810 --> 01:37:00.317
Just know I came from the
place where we're now heading.

01:37:00.417 --> 01:37:02.521
The one that you
mentioned earlier?

01:37:02.622 --> 01:37:04.926
In due time, okay?

01:37:05.026 --> 01:37:08.400
Well, then, let's get started
with the preparations.

01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:10.170
We've got quite a lot to do.

01:37:10.271 --> 01:37:13.944
I mean, you want to get going
as soon as we can, right?

01:37:15.381 --> 01:37:16.483
I do.

01:37:16.583 --> 01:37:18.052
My mother is waiting for me!

You finally managed to do it.

the extent of my gratitude.

to see how everyone is doing.

Well, now. Let's get
you back to your room.
