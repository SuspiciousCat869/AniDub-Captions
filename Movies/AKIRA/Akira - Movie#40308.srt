1
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,750
Also in other news tonight:
Groups of unemployed workers,

2
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:09,166
who have grown in numbers
due to tax reforms enacted

3
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,666
by the former prime minister,
are rioting all across

4
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,791
the country. And confusion among
members of the parliament,

5
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,541
sparked by the comments of
Finance Minister Takanashi

6
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,916
during a recent parliament
inquiry, there seems to be

7
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,708
no compromise in sight between
the government and opposition.

8
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,833
Hey, there. Call it.

9
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,875
Gimme some. Three peanuts.

10
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,750
Let's see...

11
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:47,125
The Clown bastards
are herded out on Route No. 5.

12
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,541
Damn it, don't
scare me like that.

13
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:52,958
Open that damn door quietly.

14
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,583
You know,
you wouldn't be so jumpy

15
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,250
if you didn't have
anything to hide.

16
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,791
Why don't you sell
normal drinks for a change?

17
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,458
How 'bout buying
something for once?

18
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,541
This ain't a hangout
for damn street gangs.

19
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,458
Yeah, right.
Drink your dog piss?!

20
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,541
Twin ceramic rotor drives
on each wheel...

21
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,416
Let's see... And these are...

22
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,291
computer-controlled
anti-lock brakes.

23
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,541
Two hundred horses
at twelve thousand rpm.

24
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,625
You wanna ride it, Tetsuo?

25
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,333
Alright, let's hit it!

26
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,833
I customized that bike
for myself.

27
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,500
It's too wild.
You couldn't handle it.

28
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:41,416
I don't see how you can ride
something crazy like that man.

29
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,875
Huh, I could.

30
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,791
If you want it so bad,
then steal one yourself.

31
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,708
Huh?

32
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,666
Unbelievable.

33
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,083
Hey, waiter,
where are you going?

34
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,416
They ran into the alley.
After 'em!

35
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,833
Quit fooling around,
you idiot.

36
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,583
Fuck.

37
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,458
What?

38
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,375
That's the...

39
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,958
This is unit 375.
We've got reports of biker gangs

40
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,541
fighting near the intersection
of Highway 14 South.

41
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,291
Request immediate assistance.

42
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,333
Car 375 on route to the scene.

43
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,958
Again, request
immediate assistance.

44
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,750
It's the cops.
What should we do?

45
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,250
Oh, damn it. My motor coils
were just getting warmed up.

46
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,708
Bastards. Let's go Tetsuo!

47
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,833
I'm coming. Damn them.

48
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,125
Come on!

49
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,583
A skirmish has broken out
between student protestors

50
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:16,666
and riot police. There appear
to be some causalities. Next...

51
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,291
Don't make me get out
of this car, buddy!

52
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,708
Come on jerk, I'm in a hurry!

53
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,500
What was that?

54
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:00,833
Call the police!

55
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,666
Repeal the tax reform!

56
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:30,500
This area is off limits!
Go back, it's dangerous.

57
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,833
This area is off limits!

58
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,625
Hey, something strange
over there.

59
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,541
Let me through. I'm sorry.

60
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,125
It's blood! Look!

61
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,708
Please let me through.
Excuse me. Pardon me.

62
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,083
Watch it jerk.

63
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,166
So fattening...

64
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,791
Pardon me. I'm sorry.

65
00:08:58,875 --> 00:08:59,750
What's wrong with you?

66
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:00,750
Ryu!

67
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,416
Hey, look!
They're running away!

68
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,375
Where are they going?
They're getting away!

69
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,166
He's got a gun.
Turn on that light.

70
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,375
Get out of here! Shoot!
Don't let him get away!

71
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:16,958
Fire!

72
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,041
Wait, hold your fire.
He's got a kid.

73
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:24,125
Get down. Get down. Stay down.

74
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:35,500
Run. You've gotta hurry.

75
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:43,666
Go to Ryu. He'll help you now.

76
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,125
Get out of here. Now.

77
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:24,916
Kay.

78
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,541
We gotta get out of here, Kay.

79
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,291
Wha-? He's gone.

80
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:44,916
He's to the west.

81
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,041
West? He's in the Old City.

82
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:00,875
Eat this.

83
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,458
Tetsuo!

84
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,416
Ryu! Where are you?

85
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,208
Kay!

86
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,416
No, thats-! Ohhh...

87
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,125
Huh? Ahhh!

88
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,833
How d'ya like that?

89
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:53,958
Huh?

90
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,875
Well? Who is it?

91
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,541
It's not him. It's not Tetsuo.

92
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,500
Alright. Move out!

93
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:19,083
Why you... Whaddya do?
You weird little...

94
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,333
Tetsuo. Just hang on.

95
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,625
What? What did you say?

96
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,541
That... kid.

97
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,791
He's really hurt bad.

98
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,583
Hey! You there!

99
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,416
We gotta get him to a hospital.
He needs an ambulance,

100
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,333
we can't move him.

101
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,416
Ahhh

102
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,458
What the-?

103
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,541
There's no escape.

104
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,875
We're here to
take you back with us.

105
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,458
You know we can't survive
outside. We all belong at home.

106
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,333
Well, come along.

107
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,583
These are army helicopters.
It's the army!

108
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,541
Move out!

109
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,083
Kiss the ground.
Hands on your heads.

110
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:11,500
We're, uh, innocent
bystanders, that's all.

111
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:14,041
Kiss the ground.
Hands on your heads.

112
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,958
Ahhh, that hurts dammit.

113
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,333
Kai!

114
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:33,458
Soldier

115
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:34,541
Sir

116
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:35,750
Who are those kids?

117
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,500
They seem to be
an ordinary bike gang, sir.

118
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,291
We're returning.

119
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,375
Ouch. Will you
just hold on a minute?

120
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,416
My arms don't
bend that way, you loser.

121
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,250
Pull the wounded
onto the helicopter.

122
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:07,208
Tetsuo! Hey wait-- you can't
take him away like that.

123
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,041
Kaneda!

124
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,708
What the hell are
you guys doing?

125
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,083
We didn't do anything
to deserve this!

126
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,291
He's heavy.

127
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,916
Alright, the story is you
and your friends went out

128
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,750
at night on your bikes
to visit your dying mother

129
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,291
and then another bunch of
other biker hooligans

130
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,125
called The Clowns
attacked you...

131
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,083
...they hurt your friend,
you lost your temper,

132
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,416
and that's why eight
of these clowns

133
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,333
are all now in the hospital
and that is the truth.

134
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:34,041
Oh wee, she's sure hot.

135
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,833
Hmm? This is confidential!

136
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,666
And how's your mother doing?

137
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,625
Fortunately the worst is over.
She cleared the hump.

138
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,958
She cleared the hump, huh?
What next, a triathalon?

139
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:51,291
Wha...? Ha ha ha

140
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,750
Aw, these bozos couldn't have
anything to do with it.

141
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,666
That goes without saying.

142
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,166
Wait out on that bench.
Do you understand?

143
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,333
Alright, send in
the next five.

144
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:10,625
So, the army's working
with the police to hunt down

145
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,208
anti-government groups,
or so it seems.

146
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,791
Yeah, that's it.

147
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,083
Wanna put up a fight huh?

148
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,000
Hey let me go!
Get your hands off me!

149
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,583
Long live
the freedom revolution!

150
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,833
He's got a grenade! Ah!

151
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:39,458
Die! ...huh?

152
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,333
You crazy sonova bitch!

153
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,083
Alright, that's enough.
Get 'im back in there.

154
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,291
That'll teach him
a lesson he won't forget.

155
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,875
You dumb bastard,
if you wanna die

156
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,625
just hang yourself
or something!

157
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,500
Listen, you kids
are free to leave.

158
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,041
We've contacted your school.

159
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,291
See your principal
in the morning.

160
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,333
You sonova bitch!--

161
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:09,041
Hey, hold on a second old man!

162
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,416
Old man?

163
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,250
There was someone else
with us you know.

164
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,500
What was that?

165
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,625
Will you pardon me, please?

166
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:19,791
Huh? Hey, what are you doing?

167
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,416
Uh, it's this one right here.
Can't leave my friend.

168
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,041
Don't ever call me
old man ya little punk.

169
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,416
That's my foot!

170
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,375
Ya listen here, kid.
I'm only twenty five years old.

171
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,208
I'm not even married yet.

172
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,041
So watch your mouth.
Get out of here,

173
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,875
and take your friend with you.

174
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,791
Sorry I need a doctor!

175
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,416
Well I think the army was
chasing that weird kid Kaneda

176
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,750
and Tetsuo saw,
that's what I think.

177
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,333
Yeah, you're right.
I think I saw him too.

178
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,458
And speaking of Tetsuo,
why the hell wouldn't they

179
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,416
tell us what hospital
they threw him in?

180
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,916
Huh? What was that?

181
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,750
What I meant was maybe we

182
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,875
could go for drinks
somewhere around here.

183
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,791
I figure we could have
a nice long chat

184
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:01,208
about something you're into
like the whole revolution thing.

185
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,333
Hmm. I think
you're a skirt chaser

186
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,166
who'll try anything he can.

187
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,083
You'll help anyone so long as
it's a girl, is that right?

188
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,000
You're wrong! I have very
high standards, you know?

189
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,791
Line 'em up!
Come on! Move it!

190
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:15,583
It's not their looks that
count, it's their--I dunno--

191
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,083
a girl's sensitivity
that makes me do it.

192
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:22,208
I suppose I owe you one.
Thank you very much, uh...

193
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,583
I'm Kaneda. It's nice to--

194
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,458
See you around, Kaneda.

195
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,375
Wait a second!
You're leaving just like that?

196
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:33,000
Hey! Now hold on. I am the guy
that saved you back there.

197
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,333
You could at least tell me
your name you cold bitch!

198
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:47,166
Yes, I'll try talking with him.
But it's risky business.

199
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,625
If they think you're avoiding
responsibility the whole thing

200
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,708
could blow up
in your face, right?

201
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:56,166
I can't believe that there's a
mole in the executive council.

202
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,166
Even if there is a mole.

203
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,333
That's not
what's important here.

204
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,791
What is are political
maneuvers and diplomacy,

205
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,875
which apparently you despise.

206
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,291
I never studied the two subjects
in school, it would seem.

207
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,083
In any case, at the next
executive council meeting,

208
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:13,916
your poor management and lack of
judgement on this last incident

209
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,333
will be called into question.

210
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,125
There's a call
for the colonel, sir.

211
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,083
Put your affairs in order
if you want my advice.

212
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,916
Yes, it's me. What is it now?

213
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,333
This way please, Colonel.

214
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,333
I'm terribly sorry
to call you here,

215
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,083
but there's something
you really must see.

216
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:06,583
Colonel, please observe.
It's the special pattern

217
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,541
I'm getting from
that young man.

218
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:11,166
It doesn't resemble
any like I've seen so far.

219
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,958
And I've never seen
a developmental speed

220
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,500
or configuration like this.

221
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,625
It may have begun with the shock
of contact with Number 26,

222
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,000
or it could be--

223
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,291
Have you finished
running a comparison

224
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:21,708
against Akira's pattern?

225
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,416
I'll superimpose for you.

226
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:30,208
This projection is made using
mixed data and the results

227
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:31,458
are not quite correct,

228
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:34,208
so direct comparison
is difficult.

229
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:36,083
But I believe based
on what we see here

230
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:37,625
that this boy's
pattern is the key

231
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:41,166
to solving the riddle of
Akira's growth pattern process.

232
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,416
Fine. You may continue.

233
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,000
Thank you very much, sir.
I'm certain he'll turn out to be

234
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,708
a worthy addition to the
numbers, don't you?

235
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,333
It may be rough on the boy
but I thought we might try

236
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,000
starting him off
with Level 7 capsules.

237
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,416
Is it safe, Doctor?

238
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,666
I will take care of it.

239
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:02,166
No! I wasn't talking
about the boy at all.

240
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,083
I'm asking that if he turns out
to reach a power like Akira's,

241
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:08,208
are you positive that you're
able to control such a power?

242
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,208
Uh, well, that's a--

243
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:12,666
Can I leave this
in your hands?

244
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,750
Uhhh-- Well then, in my opinion,
if we could use

245
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:18,833
the latest examination equipment
to collect even more data,

246
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:22,083
and also do a multifacited
analysis as we go,

247
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:23,541
then surely...

248
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,458
But maybe we
weren't meant to meddle

249
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:28,625
with that ultimate power.

250
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:31,375
You mean, the power of a god?

251
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,875
Ah

252
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:35,666
Ki

253
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,916
Ra

254
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,916
But we have no choice
but to grasp that power,

255
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,583
grasp that power
and learn to control it,

256
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,625
and if this situation
gets out of hand

257
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,875
then it needs
to be terminated.

258
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,666
And without hesitation.

259
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,750
Yes, Colonel.

260
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,333
This school is
your last chance.

261
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,291
If trash like yourselves
can't keep up

262
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:57,208
with the academic ability of
regular students, this is it!

263
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:59,916
If you can't live a decent
social life, you end up here

264
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,750
and if you screw up here,
it's the end of the road!

265
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,750
Also, even though
you're under fiften,

266
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:07,291
if you get more than fifty
penalty points on your record

267
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:09,000
you're sent to the
regular corps.

268
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:11,541
Eh bite me. Don't mess
with us you bald old goat.

269
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,000
Are any of you listening?

270
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,541
You lost me
halfway through, sir!

271
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:19,500
Discipline! Discipline!
Discipline! Discipline!

272
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:24,000
Discipline!
Discipline! Dismissed!

273
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:26,750
Thank you very much, sir.

274
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:31,333
Ya loser! You and me are
gonna go at it someday, Jack!

275
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:33,458
We're gonna remember
this buddy!

276
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,083
Yeah ya sick mother! Damn.

277
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:41,791
Uh, ya sure?

278
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,875
Look hey!

279
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:45,500
Yamagata why'd they
keep you so long?

280
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:47,291
Kaneda what happened
to your cheek?

281
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:48,500
I heard you got into a fight.

282
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:50,083
So what?

283
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:51,666
My friend told me. Yeah, they
told me you faught the Clowns

284
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,791
in the old city.

285
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:54,375
Big deal.

286
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:56,375
Why don't you just wipe 'em all
out? Those guys are so gross.

287
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:58,750
Clowns, there were
demonstrators, cops,

288
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:01,958
the damn army, and that idiot
Tetsuo had an accident.

289
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:04,041
But what happened to Tetsuo?

290
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:05,833
Huh? He's in the hospital
but we don't know where.

291
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:09,041
Dumb loser was
tryin' a show off.

292
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:12,416
Stupid idiot.

293
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,333
You're talking
about Tetsuo right?

294
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:16,500
Shut up already. Why do ya
always have to be hanging

295
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:17,750
on my arm every minute?

296
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:19,500
What tha heck
has gotten into you?

297
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:33,875
Huh?

298
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:37,166
Tetsuo? It's time
for your medication.

299
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:41,625
Doctor hurry! The boy is gone.

300
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:48,958
No I can't. You know the
dorm mother always throws a fit

301
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:50,708
if you go out before ten.

302
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:53,583
Yeah, you know the one
who has a face like a goat?

303
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:55,666
That woman is such
a big ol' pain.

304
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,625
She's always complaining
about us girls.

305
00:25:57,708 --> 00:26:00,416
Huh? Tomorrow at three?
Yeah that's cool.

306
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,041
Hey, what happened
to that girl? You know who.

307
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:04,750
After my friend saw him.

308
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:07,500
I don't like her at all.
Her attitude gets on my nerves.

309
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:08,625
Kaori.

310
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:10,125
What tha?

311
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:13,208
Tetsuo you're here.

312
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:17,916
Everyone's been worried about
you. They thought you were dead.

313
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,541
When I woke up, I was on an
operating table or something.

314
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:32,750
That examination--it's
like they were messing

315
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:35,083
around inside my head.

316
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:39,666
No, I don't wanna go back
there again. We'll run away.

317
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,416
Where would we go to?

318
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:47,333
I dunno. Someplace.
Someplace far away.

319
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,416
Hey it's self study today!

320
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:58,291
Where'd the teacher go to?
What about my burning desire

321
00:26:58,375 --> 00:27:01,458
to study and learn a vocation?
Well drag his butt in here.

322
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:05,125
Ah! Kaneda hurry,
come quick your bike!

323
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,250
What about my bike?

324
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:09,208
See? Look it. Down there.

325
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:13,875
Wha? Tetsuo?

326
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,416
Is this ok?

327
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,583
Ah quiet. Shut up and hang on.

328
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,208
Huh? What tha?

329
00:27:32,291 --> 00:27:33,583
What's wrong?

330
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:36,541
Aww Jesus Christ

331
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:39,666
Uh oh, we're stopping now.

332
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,958
We've stopped.

333
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:45,041
Oh I get it, the engine
can't drop below 5000 rpms,

334
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:46,333
even when
you're changing the gears.

335
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:48,458
Oh ouch. My butt hurts.

336
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,291
Hey, look. Some bikes!

337
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:54,166
Is that Kaneda and-- Wha?

338
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,625
No it isn't!

339
00:27:57,291 --> 00:27:59,500
Shit! Kaori!

340
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:04,666
Any sign of them?

341
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,166
Huata and the others
went to look around Kizenyazu.

342
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,458
The only place we have to search
now is the industrial area.

343
00:28:10,541 --> 00:28:12,208
K. Let's go!

344
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,291
We owe you for the other night.
Now it's time for payback.

345
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:28,375
Shut up!

346
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,750
Kaori! What happened?

347
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:43,583
No, don't! If you put so much as
a single scratch on that bike

348
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:45,333
I'm gonna kill your ass.

349
00:28:45,416 --> 00:28:48,416
Hahaha. Huh?

350
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,416
Run!

351
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,041
After them!

352
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:01,875
No, wait.

353
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:04,458
Huh?

354
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,250
Tetsuo!

355
00:29:29,958 --> 00:29:32,458
You're gonna kill him,
Tetsuo. You want that?

356
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:33,833
I want him more than dead.

357
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:35,583
I want to split
his friggin head open.

358
00:29:35,666 --> 00:29:38,083
Just knock it off now.
This whole thing happened

359
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:40,375
just because you took
my bike for a spin.

360
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:42,041
Enough already.

361
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:46,208
Shut up! Don't order me around!

362
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:47,833
We were just worried.

363
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:51,666
Why do ya always have
to try and save me?

364
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,750
I coulda handled it
on my own. Ya I admit,

365
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:56,583
I gotten beaten before,

366
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:59,666
but I won't always be on the
receiving end. You hear that?

367
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,500
You understand?

368
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,666
Tetsuo.

369
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:10,500
Shut up, go away.

370
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:15,833
Hey wait! Where are you going?

371
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:18,625
Leave me alone.

372
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:21,875
Akira!

373
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:27,166
Tetsuo!

374
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:32,250
Something wrong?

375
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:33,166
Akira.

376
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:37,250
I don't know who that is! Ah!

377
00:30:57,833 --> 00:30:59,666
Tetsuo... what's wrong?

378
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,250
A-Are you alright?

379
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:08,500
This is really strange.
I'm getting a blue pattern

380
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:10,375
on scope number three.

381
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:13,708
What? No!
Retrieve the subject now, hurry.

382
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:30,416
Why don't you guys
just leave my friend alone?

383
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:37,208
What's with the getup, huh?
You going to a funeral?

384
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:45,416
Tetsuo!

385
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:47,416
Kaneda!

386
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:50,000
Screw you! Huh?

387
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:00,625
No wait!

388
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,666
Kaneda, what the hell's
goin on?

389
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:22,500
Well well, I see we have
some real hip youngsters

390
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:25,041
doing their thing
inspite of the tight checkpoints

391
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:26,583
they got going around tonight.

392
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:30,041
And that just means that they're
all pretty stupid, don't it?

393
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:34,791
Huh? Oh whatever.
This is boring.

394
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:37,041
Hey, whaddya say.
Let's go home.

395
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:39,583
Wah? But it's still early.

396
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,333
Yeah, but without their bikes

397
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:43,750
they're just tail chasers
outta water.

398
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:45,250
You mean fish.

399
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:48,083
Come on, lets go
and toss these fish back.

400
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:51,666
Hey, Kaneda!
Aww what are we gonna do?

401
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:55,791
What tha heck?

402
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:56,958
Look.

403
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:24,291
It's that girl.

404
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:25,791
Here we go again.

405
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:28,833
Look lets get out of here
before we get caught up in it.

406
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:31,708
Huh? Kaneda?

407
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:32,958
Hey!

408
00:33:34,541 --> 00:33:37,500
This area is being corded off
due to a terrorist bombing.

409
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:40,208
Those who wish to get through
line up single file,

410
00:33:40,291 --> 00:33:43,125
present your ID, and precede
through the checkpoint.

411
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:55,541
Get in.

412
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:58,041
What's wrong? Hurry!
I'll meet ya shortly.

413
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:01,708
You know the
rendezvous point, right?

414
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:03,791
Be careful

415
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,250
You too. You be careful.

416
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:21,208
Hey! Hold it right there.

417
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:25,000
She's got a gun!

418
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:40,250
Ok that's far enough.
Alright? Drop it.

419
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:49,583
Drop it!

420
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:56,708
Don't do it!

421
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,541
I think it came from over here.
There were two shots, no three.

422
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:16,208
It's just up ahead.

423
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:19,791
Hey, let's get out of here.
Come on!

424
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:28,166
Kaneda!

425
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:57,791
There. Now, what's the matter?
Talk about it.

426
00:36:57,875 --> 00:37:00,583
It was a dream that I saw.

427
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:03,625
A dream?

428
00:37:03,708 --> 00:37:08,958
The city started to crumble
apart covered by a big shadow.

429
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:11,166
And lots of people died.

430
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:15,083
And the three of us,
we get to meet Akira again.

431
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,208
Wha-- Akira?

432
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:23,916
The city will crumble. So many
people. So many will die.

433
00:37:24,916 --> 00:37:28,500
When will it happen?
Do you know when? Kiyoko!

434
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:34,291
You mustn't let that boy go.
His power-- it--

435
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,000
What's she talking about?

436
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:45,541
Well, there's a-- Uhh...
there seems to be nothing

437
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:49,958
physically wrong with her and
her medication looks accurate.

438
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:51,666
There's no sign
of any abnormalities

439
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,500
in her EKG or EEG either.

440
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:57,000
I think Number 25's
statement is probably

441
00:37:57,083 --> 00:38:00,041
her precognitive power at work.

442
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:01,291
You know, this needs to be

443
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:03,583
brought before
the supreme council for inquiry.

444
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:06,208
Do you believe her?

445
00:38:06,291 --> 00:38:08,833
I have no doubts regarding
Number 25's abilities.

446
00:38:08,916 --> 00:38:12,166
We've lots of data
that substantiates it.

447
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,208
What do you believe, Colonel?

448
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:17,458
I'll tell you my job
isn't to believe or disbelieve.

449
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:19,500
It's to act or not act.

450
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:30,416
Of course there are
several security measures

451
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,208
before we enter.

452
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:33,666
Here sir.

453
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:37,250
Cold gear, Colonel. Please
put it on. You too, Doctor.

454
00:38:48,916 --> 00:38:50,750
The other day
a young researcher

455
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:52,750
came to me
and asked me something.

456
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:57,166
He wondered if their power was
the form of the next stage

457
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,958
that human evolution was taking
and purhaps we would all

458
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:02,333
be able to control it someday.

459
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:05,708
Hmph. Scientists are
a bunch of romantics.

460
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:07,583
Military men on the other
hand always consider

461
00:39:07,666 --> 00:39:09,333
the risks first.

462
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:13,416
Over thirty years
it's taken. We've come so far,

463
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,500
crawling up from the rubble.

464
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:18,250
We can't just trade one
for the other.

465
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:19,750
But I've always
thought that you've held

466
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:23,083
a resentment--even a hatred--
for this city, Colonel.

467
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:25,125
The passion to build is cool

468
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:27,541
and the joy of
reconstruction forgotten.

469
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:30,208
Now-- Now it's just
a garbage heap made up of

470
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:32,625
a bunch of hedonistic fools.

471
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:36,333
But inspite of that
you're trying to save the city.

472
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:40,083
I'm not a scientist.
I think like a soldier.

473
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:46,625
Colonel? We're here sir.
This way please.

474
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:11,166
Room ten. 148 degrees Kelvin.

475
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:14,291
Fluctuation tolerance range?
Check.

476
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:18,125
Room nine 108 degrees Kelvin.
Fluctuation tolerance range,

477
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,125
check.

478
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,291
Emergency power generator.
Check.

479
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:22,208
Open the door.

480
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:24,083
Sir. Uh...

481
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:25,208
The control room. Do it!

482
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:26,458
Yes, sir!

483
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,333
Room one is at 0.0005 degrees
Kelvin. It's within tolerances.

484
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:52,000
No abnormalities detected
within any of the rooms,

485
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,833
duar walls,
or defense systems.

486
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:58,708
No abnormal reactions
or concentrations recorded.

487
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:00,833
So then all systems are nominal.

488
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:13,666
Look at what they abandoned in
their panic. They were afraid.

489
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:16,166
They were too scared so they
hid it away from the public,

490
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,666
losing all sense
of shame and honor,

491
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:22,041
casting aside the civilization,
and abandoning the science

492
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:23,541
that created it.

493
00:41:23,625 --> 00:41:25,166
Shutting the lid
of the pandora's box

494
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,333
they themselves had opened.

495
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:32,541
Hey, we're still young.
We could start over again.

496
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:33,625
Ryu?!

497
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:35,000
So whaddya think, huh?

498
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:36,250
Ryu!

499
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:38,166
That's the first time
you killed a man, right?

500
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,458
Come on, I'll go with you.

501
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:40,625
Ryu!

502
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:42,250
You aren't listening.
Turn yourself in.

503
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,333
I'll even go to
the police station with you.

504
00:41:44,416 --> 00:41:45,458
Ryu!

505
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:48,041
Anyway, when you
get out I'll be there.

506
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:50,250
Let's go out
for drinks, alright?

507
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:53,500
Don't kick yourself over it.
What's done is done.

508
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:54,666
You've heard that.

509
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,250
The guy is dead and gone. Huh?

510
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:04,833
Huh? Identify yourselves.

511
00:42:04,916 --> 00:42:05,750
Yaa--

512
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:08,625
Ryu. Are you alright?

513
00:42:08,708 --> 00:42:09,666
Kay, it's you.

514
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,500
Ryu.

515
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,458
Who's this.

516
00:42:13,541 --> 00:42:17,875
Huh? Who's this? Well, I guess
by saying I'm Kay's boyfriend

517
00:42:17,958 --> 00:42:19,791
it's stretching it a bit.

518
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:22,333
Depends on your point
of view. But we haven't gotten

519
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:23,708
physical or anything.

520
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:24,708
You understand, don't you?

521
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:25,458
Are you a spy?

522
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:26,000
No I'm not.

523
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:26,750
You're lying!

524
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:28,291
Ahhh!

525
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,458
Well, is he a spy or not?

526
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:36,083
Whatever he is
he's certainly not a spy.

527
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:39,000
Ow.

528
00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:43,708
Sneak into their lab,
that's crazy! Ridiculous!

529
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:45,291
Remember the fiasco
with that kid?!

530
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:48,916
They're last minute orders, and
the plan is in place already.

531
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:54,875
These are the lab passes
they issue once a week.

532
00:42:54,958 --> 00:42:56,875
From Mr. Nezu, right?

533
00:42:56,958 --> 00:42:58,333
What's the objective?

534
00:42:58,416 --> 00:43:01,041
We're to gather detailed data
on the new subject.

535
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:02,916
You're kidding, a new subject?

536
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,250
Yes, last week. On the same
night we tried to abduct

537
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,583
the experimental subject
they call Number 26.

538
00:43:09,666 --> 00:43:12,541
A boy who was in an accident
on an old city highway

539
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:14,041
was brought to the lab.

540
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:16,666
It seems he's a student at
a vocational training school,

541
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:19,791
but now he's their new subject
for human experimentation.

542
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:21,333
Huh?

543
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:29,458
Hey hey hey hey hey!
What's the big idea?

544
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:30,458
Uh! Kaneda!

545
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,458
Should I kill him?
He heard us.

546
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:33,708
Ryu!

547
00:43:33,791 --> 00:43:35,666
Wait! Now just hold on
a minute. Hear me out.

548
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,000
Please listen to
what I have to say.

549
00:43:37,083 --> 00:43:38,416
Ryu, he did save me.

550
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,500
Yeah, twice!

551
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,458
Maybe he did it
just to get close to us.

552
00:43:41,541 --> 00:43:43,583
The guy who was in that
accident in the old city

553
00:43:43,666 --> 00:43:45,125
is a close friend of mine.

554
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:46,916
I know it's hard for you
to believe what I'm saying

555
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,125
but it's the truth.

556
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:51,041
I was right there
right when it happened.

557
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:53,500
Come on. Don't they say
the only foolish questions

558
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:57,583
are unasked ones?
Huh? They don't?

559
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:02,541
That's an intriging story now,
isn't it?

560
00:44:02,625 --> 00:44:05,375
Well, will you be taking
the boy with you?

561
00:44:05,458 --> 00:44:07,291
He knows the subject.
And I think we could use him

562
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:10,000
as a decoy if
we find it necessary.

563
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:12,708
New Tokyo's going
to change soon.

564
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,166
In all respects this
city is saturated.

565
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:20,250
It's like an overripe fruit.

566
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:23,333
Buried within it is a new seed.
We need only wait for the wind

567
00:44:23,416 --> 00:44:26,166
which would make it
fall to fruitition.

568
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:29,416
 The wind called Akira.

569
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,125
Ryu. Look over here.

570
00:44:33,208 --> 00:44:34,583
What is it?

571
00:44:34,666 --> 00:44:37,416
We arent the ones who will
change this. But rather it's

572
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,708
those citizens that hope
for Akira that will.

573
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:42,916
That which is called science
perverts providence.

574
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,333
That which is called progress
encourages extravagance.

575
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:48,333
That which is called
civilization devastates

576
00:44:48,416 --> 00:44:49,916
the spirit of man.

577
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,041
The time of atonement is upon
us. Are your hearts prepared?

578
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:58,125
The time is nigh! The time
of his awakening is night!

579
00:44:58,208 --> 00:45:01,625
The moment of Lord Akira's
awakening is drawing closer.

580
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:04,125
Are your hearts and minds
prepared for a new coming?

581
00:45:04,208 --> 00:45:08,000
Break it up. Holding
meetings here is prohibited.

582
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:10,125
This gathering is illegal!

583
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:15,166
Terrorist activities carried
out by antigovernment elements

584
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:17,333
have skyrocketed this month.

585
00:45:17,416 --> 00:45:19,958
The army, riot squad,
and even traffic police

586
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:23,000
have fully mobilized.
The overtime costs alone

587
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:25,041
have used up the
public safety budget.

588
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:27,083
And then there's the
abduction of Number 26.

589
00:45:27,166 --> 00:45:28,458
Isn't their existence
supposed to be

590
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:30,625
the highest of state
secrets, Colonel?

591
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:34,291
No one's ever heard of peace and
order here in Neo Tokyo-land?

592
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:38,458
And this, this request of
yours for further-- ah yes,

593
00:45:38,541 --> 00:45:42,541
for further funding because of
subject number 25's prediction.

594
00:45:42,625 --> 00:45:43,208
Well that's--

595
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:44,708
You must be joking!

596
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:46,583
While straightening out the
historic tax reform blunders

597
00:45:46,666 --> 00:45:48,250
of our former Prime Minister,

598
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:50,583
we parliament members have
been bowing our heads down

599
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:52,291
and begging the public
to bear with us

600
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:54,833
and what does
he ask for? Money.

601
00:45:54,916 --> 00:45:58,000
Where exactly do we get
that kind of money?

602
00:45:58,083 --> 00:45:59,708
We've already spend a fortune
here and all we have

603
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:02,708
to show for it is that grotesque
kindergarten you've set up.

604
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:05,333
The Olympics are next near and
the post-war period is over,

605
00:46:05,416 --> 00:46:06,875
how much longer will
you keep throwing away

606
00:46:06,958 --> 00:46:09,166
countless amounts of money
on these worthless ghosts?

607
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:11,291
I always said we should
put all that money into

608
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:12,458
the welfare program

609
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:13,416
Shut up old man!

610
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:13,958
What was that?

611
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:15,500
You heard me!

612
00:46:15,583 --> 00:46:16,916
Now listen here. That power
is starting to walk around free

613
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,416
as we speak.

614
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,583
Unless we control that power
now we'll lose everything

615
00:46:21,666 --> 00:46:22,875
we've tried so hard to achieve.

616
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:24,208
You're about to take
that old man comment back!

617
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:25,958
It was your lack of policy
that started this mess

618
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:27,500
in the first place!

619
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,416
There is still no proof that
the last world war was caused

620
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,583
by Akira in my opinion.

621
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:34,208
Don't you understand?
Unless an Akira disaster

622
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:37,666
actually happens-- Don't you
people understand anything?

623
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:40,875
Has anyone ever seen
this Number 26 Akira?

624
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:42,083
You're wrong!

625
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:45,125
Break it up!

626
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:47,875
I say that the Colonel has lost
sight of his duty as a soldier.

627
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:51,041
Yes, he's right! And I
have had several reports.

628
00:46:51,125 --> 00:46:53,125
Reports on
antigovernment elements.

629
00:46:53,208 --> 00:46:55,208
How they're using your
Akira madness to ramp up

630
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:57,000
their terrorist ferver.

631
00:46:57,083 --> 00:46:58,875
That's not true. It's just not.

632
00:46:58,958 --> 00:47:01,625
Then what about that Akira
World Renewal movement?

633
00:47:01,708 --> 00:47:04,125
Wouldn't you say that
information's being leaked?

634
00:47:04,208 --> 00:47:07,125
World Renewal Movement? It's
more like the end of the world.

635
00:47:07,208 --> 00:47:09,875
Aren't you just using Akira
as camoflage to cover up

636
00:47:09,958 --> 00:47:11,333
your misconduct? Admit it!

637
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:13,208
What are you getting at?

638
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:16,500
Colonel. Please be calm
and try to understand

639
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:19,458
that we can no longer leave
the peace of Neo Tokyo

640
00:47:19,541 --> 00:47:22,791
to your sole discretion.
Understood?

641
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:26,458
I'm sorry, but you're to be put
before an inquiry committee.

642
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:29,000
You and the whole military
needs a reform!

643
00:47:31,375 --> 00:47:32,166
Excuse me.

644
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,250
What?

645
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:36,916
This discussion isn't over.

646
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
This is an outrage. 

647
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:38,708
You should explain yourself!

648
00:47:38,791 --> 00:47:40,125
How dare you walk--

649
00:47:40,208 --> 00:47:41,833
Are you trying to insult
the supreme executive council?

650
00:47:41,916 --> 00:47:43,583
His behavior is intolerable!

651
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,833
Need-Need water

652
00:48:41,958 --> 00:48:44,750
Hey, wait a minute! Let's see...

653
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:47,541
Isn't that cable replacement
due for next week?

654
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:51,208
Well, the cable they ordered
came in a whole week early.

655
00:48:51,291 --> 00:48:53,625
And besides, I got
vacation time coming

656
00:48:53,708 --> 00:48:55,375
and I'm leaving this weekend,

657
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:58,875
but if I bring the workers back
there'll be overtime.

658
00:48:58,958 --> 00:49:00,666
I could leave now
and come back but

659
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:03,083
the work's gotta be
done sooner or later.

660
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:09,791
Alright guys, let's go.

661
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:41,583
What tha--?

662
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:54,458
What tha hell?

663
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,833
It's milk! Wh-Wha--?

664
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:22,041
Stay away! No!

665
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:29,958
Ahhh!

666
00:51:35,208 --> 00:51:36,458
It's blood.

667
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:38,333
I'm scared.

668
00:51:46,458 --> 00:51:48,375
Weirdo.

669
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:51,291
Those kids... who are they?

670
00:52:43,416 --> 00:52:45,875
Huh? Hmmm.

671
00:52:45,958 --> 00:52:51,833
Patient room 887. Shema, Tetsuo.
Oh! The automatic lock's off.

672
00:52:56,875 --> 00:53:00,166
Hey you! You're not
allowed to leave your room!

673
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:07,125
See to it. There,
we'll find another room.

674
00:53:07,208 --> 00:53:09,458
Get a load of the room.
Looks like a tornado hit it.

675
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:10,916
Look at all that glass!

676
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:34,291
There are 58 blocks
with circuits that

677
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:36,208
the computer will display.

678
00:53:36,291 --> 00:53:38,166
Of those, nearly 40
are concentrated

679
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:40,125
on underground levels
seven and eight.

680
00:53:40,208 --> 00:53:41,916
That's probably the place.

681
00:53:44,666 --> 00:53:47,083
The central wiring shaft
should be straight up ahead.

682
00:53:47,166 --> 00:53:51,166
We'll be able to use that to go
straight down to the sub levels.

683
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:54,708
Be careful.
It's deeper in the middle.

684
00:53:54,791 --> 00:53:56,291
Hoo, what a stink.

685
00:53:56,375 --> 00:53:58,083
Don't you ever stop talking?

686
00:53:58,166 --> 00:54:00,333
What? I said it stinks
because it stinks.

687
00:54:00,416 --> 00:54:01,458
Is your nose
busted or something?

688
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:03,125
Keep up and be quiet.

689
00:54:04,791 --> 00:54:07,208
Damn. Hug the walls.

690
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:08,916
Huh? What are you guys doing?

691
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,375
You idiot, get down!

692
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:26,583
They left?

693
00:54:26,666 --> 00:54:28,250
Looks like they beefed up
security, doesn't it?

694
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:29,583
Must be that siren we heard.

695
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:31,375
Ryu, can you scout
a way around it?

696
00:54:31,458 --> 00:54:33,000
No, I wanna check out
the security at the very least.

697
00:54:33,083 --> 00:54:34,583
Hey are you ok?

698
00:54:34,666 --> 00:54:37,083
Let's keep going.

699
00:54:37,166 --> 00:54:39,458
Damn they spotted us!
Run for it!

700
00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:40,833
Turn back you bastards!

701
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:42,875
Shu! Hold your fire!

702
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:51,041
Shumazaki! Ugh. You assholes.

703
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:53,041
Forget it! Run!

704
00:54:56,958 --> 00:54:58,625
What the hell
is that thing huh?

705
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:01,166
Go!

706
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:02,750
Huh? He's dead.

707
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:04,250
Let it go.

708
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:11,583
Die!

709
00:55:11,666 --> 00:55:15,041
This is Unit 304 Shaft Ditch.
I have encountered intruders.

710
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:17,833
Requesting backup.
Now engaging.

711
00:55:17,916 --> 00:55:19,083
Here he comes!

712
00:55:44,791 --> 00:55:46,041
Uh! Kay!

713
00:55:48,791 --> 00:55:50,833
Dammit. The gun!

714
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:56,708
Kaneda!

715
00:56:06,666 --> 00:56:08,625
Kay, over here!

716
00:56:08,708 --> 00:56:10,750
Huh? Now!

717
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,750
Kaneda come on! Hurry!

718
00:56:30,041 --> 00:56:31,166
Kaneda no!

719
00:56:44,541 --> 00:56:47,875
What the hell? Where are
the brakes? That's not it.

720
00:56:47,958 --> 00:56:50,500
I-- This is the central
wiring shaft, I think.

721
00:56:50,583 --> 00:56:52,000
I can't figure it out.

722
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:53,291
What the--?

723
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,416
There now,
that's right. Behave.

724
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,000
Ask the Colonel for clearance
on the use of firearms.

725
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:04,500
Hey turn the radio up.

726
00:57:05,583 --> 00:57:07,208
There must be some
kind of mistake here.

727
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:09,916
That boy looks like the patient
they admitted over in the lab.

728
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,166
Correct. The boy is a
psychic named Tetsuo Shima.

729
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:14,916
He broke out of his ward. He's
headed for the baby room!

730
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,333
It's Tetsuo?

731
00:57:16,416 --> 00:57:18,791
He's extremely dangerous.
Do not let him through.

732
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:20,875
I repeat, do not
let him through.

733
00:57:58,625 --> 00:58:00,708
It's no use hiding any more.

734
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:03,333
We have no choice then.
Use your guns.

735
00:58:03,416 --> 00:58:04,875
We can't let him
go any further.

736
00:58:04,958 --> 00:58:07,583
No matter what it takes. Fire!

737
00:58:48,166 --> 00:58:50,375
Good. All here, are you?

738
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:57,625
Stop it!

739
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:02,125
So how long are you
gonna keep playing around?

740
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:11,625
Where's the other one
hiding, huh?

741
00:59:11,708 --> 00:59:13,708
Hey you, you're a creton.

742
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,000
Huh?

743
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:16,333
Die!

744
00:59:19,125 --> 00:59:20,583
Takashi!

745
00:59:31,458 --> 00:59:36,083
What the hell is going on
with me? Am I dreaming?

746
00:59:36,166 --> 00:59:40,250
These powers... are they real
or just an hallucination?

747
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:49,375
Dammit where the hell
am I going? Where?

748
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:52,833
Proceed straight.
Proceed straight ahead.

749
00:59:52,916 --> 00:59:54,083
Huh?

750
00:59:54,166 --> 00:59:56,458
You'll find
a freight elevator just ahead.

751
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:01,166
You can take it down
to sublevel eight.

752
01:00:09,166 --> 01:00:12,208
That's good.
You're all together.

753
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:16,916
You thought you could kill me?
I'm through with it.

754
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,458
You tried to mess with me
and now I'm gonna kill you.

755
01:00:21,541 --> 01:00:22,750
Huh?

756
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:29,208
You were there. I remember.

757
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:30,250
Takashi! 

758
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:31,083
Huh?

759
01:00:31,166 --> 01:00:32,625
Together, let's attack him!

760
01:00:32,708 --> 01:00:34,375
Uh, uh huh.

761
01:00:39,208 --> 01:00:40,833
You little twerps!

762
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:58,875
All of you, that is enough!

763
01:01:07,708 --> 01:01:09,708
Who the hell are you?

764
01:01:12,375 --> 01:01:16,041
Huh? What's the matter?
Is your head hurting?

765
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:19,041
Tetsuo Shima, your power
isn't fully matured yet.

766
01:01:19,125 --> 01:01:22,000
If you push yourself
you might do irreparable damage.

767
01:01:22,083 --> 01:01:23,291
We can help.

768
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:26,333
What the hell? What.. did...
you people... do?

769
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:27,875
You messed with my head.

770
01:01:36,166 --> 01:01:38,333
Tetsuo Shima, calm yourself.

771
01:01:38,416 --> 01:01:40,208
But he can't control it, sir.

772
01:01:45,541 --> 01:01:46,791
Whaddyou say?

773
01:01:46,875 --> 01:01:49,708
She said that big people
like you should never use

774
01:01:49,791 --> 01:01:52,333
the power in
the way that you are.

775
01:01:52,416 --> 01:01:55,041
And bad things will come of it.

776
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:57,000
Mind your own business,
will ya.

777
01:01:59,291 --> 01:02:00,916
What?

778
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
More powerful than I am now?

779
01:02:05,625 --> 01:02:07,416
He's the one.
He's the one that's been

780
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,083
invading my head all along.

781
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,208
Where is he? Where's
this Akira? Tell me now!

782
01:02:13,291 --> 01:02:14,083
What?

783
01:02:14,166 --> 01:02:15,500
Kiyoko says she'll wake him up,

784
01:02:15,583 --> 01:02:18,166
and if you awaken
Akira like that...

785
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:21,125
...when that happens noone will
be able to stop him at all.

786
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:22,791
To prevent it
we have to stop you.

787
01:02:22,875 --> 01:02:24,791
Ridiculous. Akira's already--

788
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:26,375
Where is he?

789
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:30,458
No! Don't!

790
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:31,541
Stay clear!

791
01:02:37,458 --> 01:02:40,541
Red Level facility integrity
is down to level seven.

792
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:42,458
Enacting disaster protocal.

793
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:45,500
Red Level facility integrity
is past level seven.

794
01:02:45,583 --> 01:02:47,458
Enacting disaster protocal.

795
01:02:47,541 --> 01:02:50,625
Red Level facility integrity
is past level seven.

796
01:02:50,708 --> 01:02:52,833
Enacting disaster protocal.

797
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:02,458
Hands up. Now.

798
01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:07,500
Where in the hell
is the freakin baby room?

799
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:30,333
Heads up! Gang way
coming through coming through!

800
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:35,166
Ugh. Kiyoko. Uh.

801
01:03:54,208 --> 01:03:55,666
Gah, that hurt.

802
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:59,333
Kaneda. What are you
doing in here?

803
01:04:02,041 --> 01:04:05,541
Tetsuo! You ok?
I'm here for the rescue.

804
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,708
Hurry up, what are you? Stupid?

805
01:04:09,791 --> 01:04:11,291
If we don't
get out of here those--

806
01:04:13,458 --> 01:04:15,208
There he is! Capture him!

807
01:04:17,833 --> 01:04:19,333
You keep away!

808
01:04:24,333 --> 01:04:25,833
Kaneda!

809
01:04:28,125 --> 01:04:30,625
Oh that's right,
I forgot you were there.

810
01:04:32,375 --> 01:04:35,541
There, do you see Kaneda?
I won't be needing you

811
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:39,333
to come to the rescue
ever again. K?

812
01:04:39,416 --> 01:04:42,583
From now on, I'll be
in charge of the heroics.

813
01:04:42,666 --> 01:04:45,500
So if you need any saving
just ask, Kanie

814
01:04:45,583 --> 01:04:47,625
Dammit, Tetsuo. Who the hell

815
01:04:47,708 --> 01:04:50,000
do you think you're
talking to ya moron?

816
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,625
Hah. You don't like what you're
hearing, do ya? Makes you angry?

817
01:04:55,708 --> 01:04:59,000
So whaddya gonna do now?
Well? Kaneda?

818
01:04:59,083 --> 01:05:01,125
What are you gonna do now?

819
01:05:10,791 --> 01:05:12,083
That's enough!

820
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,833
Stop it.
Don't hurt anyone else.

821
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:20,000
Where's this Akira?

822
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:21,416
I won't tell.

823
01:05:22,458 --> 01:05:25,291
On the big stadium?
Underground?

824
01:05:25,375 --> 01:05:29,125
No, don't. What you're thinking
is wrong. Akira is--

825
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:32,458
Wait!

826
01:05:33,458 --> 01:05:35,208
Wai--

827
01:05:41,958 --> 01:05:45,166
What the hell?
I can do this too?

828
01:05:52,541 --> 01:05:54,916
Kiyoko? Are you alright?

829
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,500
It doesn't look like
she's hurt.

830
01:05:56,583 --> 01:05:59,458
What about you, Masaru?
Look, you're bleeding.

831
01:05:59,541 --> 01:06:01,291
Where'd he go to?

832
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:03,125
He flew away.

833
01:06:03,208 --> 01:06:05,583
How can he have so much power?

834
01:06:07,583 --> 01:06:11,333
How could this have happened?
Dammit, where are my men at?

835
01:06:11,416 --> 01:06:13,583
He's developed so much power
in such a short time,

836
01:06:13,666 --> 01:06:15,500
it's unbelievable.

837
01:06:15,583 --> 01:06:17,750
Find him.
Start searching for Tetsuo.

838
01:06:17,833 --> 01:06:19,666
Kaneda quick, come on get up!

839
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:20,833
Come on, move it!

840
01:06:20,916 --> 01:06:22,541
Somebody help me with this rock.

841
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:25,291
Oh. Help me.

842
01:06:25,375 --> 01:06:27,541
Tetsuo went to where Akira is.

843
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:31,708
What? That's good.
You're all safe.

844
01:06:31,791 --> 01:06:33,166
He's heading for
the facility below

845
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:35,708
the Olympic construction site.
He went there.

846
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:37,208
How did he find out about it?

847
01:06:41,541 --> 01:06:44,666
Dammit. You're saying that
he's managed to escape?

848
01:06:47,458 --> 01:06:49,833
Alright, then, we'll follow him.
You men, look alive there!

849
01:06:49,916 --> 01:06:51,041
Move those bodies!

850
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:53,416
Get this place in order.
Prepare for pursuit.

851
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,541
He's heading west
towards the stadium.

852
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:58,458
Come on, move! I want
additional checkpoints--

853
01:06:58,541 --> 01:07:00,500
It was you.

854
01:07:06,125 --> 01:07:08,541
According to the security
team, reviews of tapes

855
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:10,583
showed five intruders
disguised as workers

856
01:07:10,666 --> 01:07:12,291
entered into the wiring shaft.

857
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:13,541
Besides the two--

858
01:07:13,625 --> 01:07:16,083
I have to stop him
before his powers mature.

859
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:20,666
Your objective is the boy
Tetsuo Shima. If we are unable

860
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:24,166
to capture him we'll lure him
out to the old city and attack.

861
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:26,583
Request assistance from
the Eastern Disctrit Battalion.

862
01:07:26,666 --> 01:07:27,833
Yes sir.

863
01:07:27,916 --> 01:07:29,833
Tell them there isn't
a moment to lose here.

864
01:07:31,875 --> 01:07:33,958
I've been waiting here
a long time, Colonel.

865
01:07:35,291 --> 01:07:38,666
What are you doing here? Huh?

866
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:39,958
I'm here to inform you tonight

867
01:07:40,041 --> 01:07:42,583
of the Supreme Executive
Council's decision.

868
01:07:44,458 --> 01:07:47,166
At twenty four hundred hours
today the Colonel is hereby

869
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:49,875
stripped of his command
and rank and shall be placed

870
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:51,291
under arrest.

871
01:07:51,375 --> 01:07:52,291
What the hell?

872
01:07:53,583 --> 01:07:55,958
Kindly accompany us now.

873
01:07:56,041 --> 01:07:58,625
You really expect me to hand
Neo Tokyo over to those fools

874
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:00,041
at a time like this?

875
01:08:03,208 --> 01:08:03,791
Shoot him.

876
01:08:03,875 --> 01:08:04,625
Yes, sir.

877
01:08:04,708 --> 01:08:07,708
Wha-- No wait, hold on! No!

878
01:08:09,666 --> 01:08:13,291
Enough! Open your eyes
and look at the big picture.

879
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:16,291
You're all puppets of corrupt
politicians and capitalists.

880
01:08:21,041 --> 01:08:22,791
Don't you understand?
It's utterly pointless

881
01:08:22,875 --> 01:08:24,625
to fight each other.

882
01:08:28,958 --> 01:08:31,333
Announce a state of emergency,
and arrest all members of

883
01:08:31,416 --> 01:08:35,625
the Executive Council.
Break their chain of command.

884
01:08:35,708 --> 01:08:37,625
Lift off.
We're going after Tetsuo.

885
01:08:37,708 --> 01:08:39,583
Urgent message, repeat urgent.

886
01:08:39,666 --> 01:08:41,666
To all district
battalion commanders--

887
01:08:51,416 --> 01:08:55,333
Yo. What's up? You're alone?

888
01:08:57,041 --> 01:08:59,916
That's right.
Weren't you in an accident?

889
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,333
Your friends have
been really worried.

890
01:09:02,416 --> 01:09:03,208
You ok?

891
01:09:03,291 --> 01:09:06,041
Give me some... capsules.

892
01:09:06,125 --> 01:09:11,291
Huh? You sure you want capsules
son? You look kinda woozy.

893
01:09:11,375 --> 01:09:13,333
You better get 'em now.

894
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:16,708
Alright, whatever the
customer wants but you know

895
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:19,750
with all those terrorist attacks
lately and the demonstrations,

896
01:09:19,833 --> 01:09:21,083
things have been pretty rough.

897
01:09:21,166 --> 01:09:22,625
In fact, they're
hard to come by

898
01:09:22,708 --> 01:09:24,875
so the price is pretty
expensive. Right?

899
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:32,916
Tetsuo's run off somewhere.
Kaneda's disappeared.

900
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,666
Damn I guess the team
is finished.

901
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:38,916
And the checkpoints are so
strict these days. Argh.

902
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,583
Even the clowns are laying low.

903
01:09:45,541 --> 01:09:48,916
What the hell happened?

904
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,291
Look at--

905
01:09:55,458 --> 01:09:56,250
He's dead!

906
01:09:56,333 --> 01:09:57,333
What?

907
01:09:59,375 --> 01:10:00,500
Who's that?

908
01:10:07,208 --> 01:10:08,375
It's Tetsuo.

909
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:12,833
Why are you here?
You did this, didn't you?

910
01:10:12,916 --> 01:10:15,916
Look who's here. Wanna pop one?

911
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,666
What tha hell are you
talking about?

912
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:19,125
You look like a damn crackhead.

913
01:10:19,208 --> 01:10:20,958
Talk sense. What happened here?

914
01:10:21,041 --> 01:10:22,791
Did you notice
that the owner's dead?

915
01:10:25,375 --> 01:10:27,375
A fish out of water dies, huh?

916
01:10:28,541 --> 01:10:32,916
Are you... Tetsuo?
Or someone else?

917
01:10:34,291 --> 01:10:36,166
Kaneda sends
his warmest regards.

918
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:38,250
You saw Kaneda? Where is he?

919
01:10:38,333 --> 01:10:41,000
He's probably dead by now.

920
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:47,333
Kai was right. You did this,
didn't you?

921
01:10:47,416 --> 01:10:50,000
All you're good for now
is telling me

922
01:10:50,083 --> 01:10:51,833
where Kaneda's bike is.

923
01:10:51,916 --> 01:10:53,083
Tetsuo!

924
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:56,500
It's a piece of shit anyway.

925
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:58,625
You son of a bitch.

926
01:11:03,541 --> 01:11:04,958
Yamagata.

927
01:11:11,416 --> 01:11:13,916
Goddammit. Huh?

928
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,083
So is he off to find Akira?

929
01:11:22,166 --> 01:11:24,583
Yes, that's what
that girl was saying.

930
01:11:24,666 --> 01:11:27,041
Now the army, Ryu, and
yourself are all trying

931
01:11:27,125 --> 01:11:29,625
at once to find this Akira guy
and that's also why

932
01:11:29,708 --> 01:11:31,416
you're chasing after Tetsuo.

933
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,458
It must have to do
with the powers he's got.

934
01:11:34,541 --> 01:11:37,791
Uh, what the hell
is this Akira thing huh?

935
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:45,791
I asked Ryu one time. He told me
that Akira is ultimate energy.

936
01:11:45,875 --> 01:11:47,958
Ultimate energy?

937
01:11:48,041 --> 01:11:51,791
Humans do all kinds of things
during their lifetime, right?

938
01:11:51,875 --> 01:11:56,833
Discovering things,
building things.

939
01:11:56,916 --> 01:12:01,583
Things like houses,
high speed trains, motorcycles,

940
01:12:01,666 --> 01:12:04,416
bridges and cities, rockets.

941
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:07,916
So where do you suppose all that
knowledge and energy comes from?

942
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:12,750
Humans were once
like monkeys, right?

943
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:18,625
And before that like reptiles,
and fish? And even before that,

944
01:12:18,708 --> 01:12:22,666
plankton and amoebas, even
little creatures like those

945
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:25,250
have incredible amounts
of energy inside them.

946
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:28,625
Oh, yessir-- huh?
It's in the genes, right?

947
01:12:28,708 --> 01:12:32,000
And even before that.
Maybe there was genetic material

948
01:12:32,083 --> 01:12:33,833
in the air and water.

949
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:36,458
Even in the particles
of dust and space.

950
01:12:36,541 --> 01:12:39,250
And if that's the truth,
then what sort of memories

951
01:12:39,333 --> 01:12:41,125
are hidden within them?

952
01:12:41,208 --> 01:12:44,708
The beginning of the universe?
Or maybe even before that.

953
01:12:44,791 --> 01:12:48,083
What's with all the crazy talk.
Are you sure you're ok?

954
01:12:48,166 --> 01:12:51,750
Listen to ya. Or did you get
bonked on the head back there?

955
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:55,208
And what if everyone
shares those ancient memories?

956
01:12:55,291 --> 01:12:58,083
What if there were some
mistakes in the progression?

957
01:12:58,166 --> 01:13:00,625
Something goes wrong and
an amoeba is suddenly given

958
01:13:00,708 --> 01:13:02,833
the higher powers
that a human has?

959
01:13:03,958 --> 01:13:06,666
Akira... is an... amoeba, then?

960
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:10,166
Amoebas don't build their own
houses and bridges, do they?

961
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:13,291
They just devour all the food
they can find around them.

962
01:13:13,375 --> 01:13:15,458
Is that what Tetsuo's doing?

963
01:13:15,541 --> 01:13:18,000
Are you saying he has
that kind of energy?

964
01:13:18,083 --> 01:13:21,208
Long ago there were people
who tried to gain control

965
01:13:21,291 --> 01:13:22,958
of that power.

966
01:13:23,041 --> 01:13:25,458
That is, all at the
government's request

967
01:13:25,541 --> 01:13:27,000
but they failed
in their attempt

968
01:13:27,083 --> 01:13:30,583
and it triggered
the fall of Tokyo.

969
01:13:30,666 --> 01:13:34,833
And that power is something that
is totally beyond our--

970
01:13:37,125 --> 01:13:38,583
Wha--

971
01:13:38,666 --> 01:13:40,041
The door's unlocked.

972
01:13:50,291 --> 01:13:53,083
It's a trap. This is just
too good of a setup.

973
01:13:53,166 --> 01:13:54,583
Go back then.

974
01:13:54,666 --> 01:13:57,166
No way. I wanna find out just
how much of a trap it is,

975
01:13:57,250 --> 01:13:58,458
don't you?

976
01:13:59,958 --> 01:14:04,416
By the way, what's going on
with you and that Ryu guy?

977
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:06,333
What in the world
are you talking about?

978
01:14:06,416 --> 01:14:07,375
You're always together.

979
01:14:07,458 --> 01:14:08,791
It's none of your business.

980
01:14:10,291 --> 01:14:12,625
No wait, hear me out.
What I'm saying is--

981
01:14:12,708 --> 01:14:15,250
he doesn't know
about us, does he?

982
01:14:15,333 --> 01:14:19,625
About us? Hey wait a minute.
What's that supposed to mean?

983
01:14:19,708 --> 01:14:20,958
Do you think it'll work?

984
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:22,083
It can't be helped.

985
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:27,416
At this point in time, our only
option left is to use her.

986
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:30,083
Well the fact that without us
even looking she turned up

987
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:32,458
right under our noses
says as much.

988
01:14:32,541 --> 01:14:34,000
What do you think?

989
01:14:34,083 --> 01:14:35,625
I guess so.

990
01:14:49,833 --> 01:14:53,583
...have arrived in ward thirteen
east Ginza section, over.

991
01:14:53,666 --> 01:14:55,000
Northern District Battalion
has not responded

992
01:14:55,083 --> 01:14:57,625
to mobilization request.

993
01:14:57,708 --> 01:15:00,625
Special Search Team to HQ.
Special Search Team to HQ.

994
01:15:00,708 --> 01:15:02,750
We're at the Harokira Bar
near the highway exchange

995
01:15:02,833 --> 01:15:04,166
at ward eight.

996
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,208
It doesn't look like any sort
of bomb explosion to us

997
01:15:06,291 --> 01:15:07,625
so we think it was him.

998
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:10,000
No sir, it wasn't
a gas explosion either.

999
01:15:10,875 --> 01:15:12,500
It was almost certainly
the work of the subject

1000
01:15:12,583 --> 01:15:14,458
that escaped from the lab.

1001
01:15:14,541 --> 01:15:17,416
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Understood.

1002
01:15:22,625 --> 01:15:25,666
Huh? Kaneda, wait!

1003
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:28,333
What? Yamagata's dead?

1004
01:15:28,416 --> 01:15:31,125
Something seemed strange about
him the second I saw his face.

1005
01:15:31,208 --> 01:15:32,750
It's odd. He was
wearing what looked like

1006
01:15:32,833 --> 01:15:34,166
a white hospital gown.

1007
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:36,041
He acted like
a different person.

1008
01:15:37,583 --> 01:15:40,583
Yamagata asked him
if he was really Tetsuo,

1009
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:42,583
or if he was someone else.

1010
01:15:42,666 --> 01:15:46,916
And then he... Yamagata, why?

1011
01:15:49,833 --> 01:15:52,041
We've always been together.

1012
01:15:52,125 --> 01:15:56,083
I've known everything
about him ever--

1013
01:15:56,166 --> 01:15:58,750
--ever since we were in the
children's home together.

1014
01:15:58,833 --> 01:16:02,125
They'd tease--
Everybody tried to make him cry.

1015
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,166
Oh yeah. He really wanted
to know where your bike was at.

1016
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:09,833
Where my bike was?

1017
01:16:17,541 --> 01:16:18,708
What are you gonna do?

1018
01:16:21,083 --> 01:16:22,791
I'm gonna go send
Yamagata his wheels.

1019
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:30,041
You dumb bastard!

1020
01:16:33,833 --> 01:16:34,875
Kaneda!

1021
01:16:51,291 --> 01:16:53,875
Kay! What's wrong?

1022
01:16:58,125 --> 01:17:01,250
That night. You were there.

1023
01:17:04,916 --> 01:17:06,041
Wait.

1024
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:13,416
Kay!

1025
01:17:17,416 --> 01:17:18,875
Th-They're gone.

1026
01:17:20,625 --> 01:17:23,541
You're the one, right? You
changed my friend, didn't you?

1027
01:17:23,625 --> 01:17:26,958
The thing about Akira's power
is it exists within everyone

1028
01:17:27,041 --> 01:17:28,458
from the start.

1029
01:17:28,541 --> 01:17:30,833
Hey, who is that? Huh?

1030
01:17:30,916 --> 01:17:33,958
But, when that power
is awakened inside,

1031
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:37,708
it is important to wisely
choose how to use it.

1032
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:40,208
When the time comes,
you might not know it

1033
01:17:40,291 --> 01:17:43,458
let alone be prepared for it.

1034
01:17:43,541 --> 01:17:46,291
Your friend has
already made his choice.

1035
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:51,708
Tetsuo is our newest companion.
He's our friend, also.

1036
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:55,250
His actions are out of control,

1037
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:57,458
and for that we're
partly to blame too.

1038
01:17:57,541 --> 01:18:00,750
Great! Then what in the hell
did you take Kay for?

1039
01:18:00,833 --> 01:18:03,500
We're hoping she'll be able
to help us in some way.

1040
01:18:03,583 --> 01:18:06,625
They're people, not toys.
Bring her back to me.

1041
01:18:06,708 --> 01:18:08,791
And Tetsuo's our friend,
not yours.

1042
01:18:08,875 --> 01:18:11,541
If someone's gonna kill him
it should be us!

1043
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:15,375
Hey!

1044
01:18:17,666 --> 01:18:20,291
Are you sure? Mr Ame and
the others have been arrested

1045
01:18:20,375 --> 01:18:22,166
in a coup de tas?

1046
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:24,541
Yes, that's right.
The post guards

1047
01:18:24,625 --> 01:18:26,375
are fighting them right now.

1048
01:18:26,458 --> 01:18:28,875
Yes, I'd like to have
a helicopter waiting

1049
01:18:28,958 --> 01:18:30,916
at West Point. Yes.

1050
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:35,208
That damn Colonel, I can't
believe he's taken up arms.

1051
01:18:38,166 --> 01:18:39,583
I've underestimated him.

1052
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:46,166
Hold them down!

1053
01:19:17,083 --> 01:19:19,416
Mr. Nezu, I--

1054
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:22,166
Ohhh... Ryu, is that you?

1055
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:26,833
I came to apologize, sir.
The mission... was a failure.

1056
01:19:26,916 --> 01:19:32,416
Damn you! I told you you can't
be seen here. Get out!

1057
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:36,916
My two best men... they're dead.
Everyone was killed.

1058
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,958
You bastard. You sold me out.

1059
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:41,458
Wha-What?

1060
01:19:45,166 --> 01:19:46,583
K-Kay...

1061
01:19:58,333 --> 01:20:02,625
Huh? What? Yeah,
Seventh Avenue is just up ahead.

1062
01:20:02,708 --> 01:20:05,166
It intersects this road
a hundred meters from here.

1063
01:20:09,541 --> 01:20:10,625
Battlestations!

1064
01:20:19,625 --> 01:20:23,166
Right. The subject
has been spotted.

1065
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:27,791
What? Attack the kid?
But sir, he's just a boy.

1066
01:20:27,875 --> 01:20:29,250
We can't attack him.

1067
01:20:33,791 --> 01:20:36,791
Look, there he is!
Impossible. Is this for real?

1068
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,750
Firing preparations
are complete.

1069
01:20:53,583 --> 01:20:55,250
Dammit! Fire!

1070
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:03,583
Wha?

1071
01:21:08,875 --> 01:21:12,500
Is it Akira?
Look, it's Lord Akira!

1072
01:21:13,833 --> 01:21:16,375
Don't be fooled, this isn't the
rapture. He's a false messiah.

1073
01:21:16,458 --> 01:21:22,000
Oh shut up.
Long live Akira! Akira!

1074
01:21:22,083 --> 01:21:24,583
Fire!

1075
01:21:24,666 --> 01:21:25,541
What the--?

1076
01:21:25,625 --> 01:21:26,791
What's wrong?

1077
01:22:54,375 --> 01:22:57,375
Coming to you live from News
Chopper 1 high over downtown.

1078
01:22:57,458 --> 01:22:59,125
Neo Tokyo Broadcasting
is exclusively

1079
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:01,291
covering the news today
inspite of martial law

1080
01:23:01,375 --> 01:23:02,958
in the name of
freedom of the press.

1081
01:23:03,041 --> 01:23:05,375
What in the world is happening
here in Neo Tokyo?

1082
01:23:05,458 --> 01:23:08,500
What you see here seems to be
fires caused by tank cannons.

1083
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:10,583
But who is this young boy
standing alone?

1084
01:23:10,666 --> 01:23:13,291
Is he fighting the coup de tas
forces all by himself?

1085
01:23:13,375 --> 01:23:15,500
I'm sorry,
we've been ordered to land.

1086
01:23:15,583 --> 01:23:17,666
The army's just
illegally ordered us to land.

1087
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:20,041
Now what is at stake here
is freedom of the press.

1088
01:23:20,125 --> 01:23:21,458
I'm sorry, we've
been ordered to--

1089
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,958
The bridge!
He's headed for the bridge!

1090
01:23:46,833 --> 01:23:48,625
Are you sure you wanna
do this alone?

1091
01:23:49,625 --> 01:23:52,541
This is what he wants, isn't it?

1092
01:23:52,625 --> 01:23:56,958
At least give me time to get
the gang together. Hey wait!

1093
01:23:57,041 --> 01:23:59,041
I wouldn't want to keep him
waiting now, would I?

1094
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:03,208
Hey Kaneda, hold on!
Will you think?

1095
01:24:10,125 --> 01:24:12,708
Half of them seem to be
anti-government demonstrators.

1096
01:24:12,791 --> 01:24:14,041
The rest are--

1097
01:24:14,125 --> 01:24:15,916
Well, they're more like
crazy cult and onlookers.

1098
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,041
They're following
after the subject.

1099
01:24:17,125 --> 01:24:18,750
And more and more
of them keep coming.

1100
01:24:24,583 --> 01:24:29,791
Flames of purity raise the
corrupt city and burn forever

1101
01:24:29,875 --> 01:24:32,166
all the unclean
believers of our time.

1102
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:34,791
Give yourselves unto
the flames so that all of you

1103
01:24:34,875 --> 01:24:36,458
should be born again.

1104
01:24:36,541 --> 01:24:39,708
Now consume our hearts,
wash our unclean hearts

1105
01:24:39,791 --> 01:24:41,416
in the eternal fire.

1106
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:44,458
Your bodies will be purified
in the flames.

1107
01:24:45,625 --> 01:24:46,625
Ready?

1108
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:48,708
What?

1109
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:49,958
Fire!

1110
01:24:55,541 --> 01:24:57,375
Set the switch to hold
for three seconds,

1111
01:24:57,458 --> 01:24:59,708
then convert your beams.

1112
01:24:59,791 --> 01:25:01,791
Aim. Fire!

1113
01:25:15,541 --> 01:25:17,958
Look out!
Let's get out of here!

1114
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,958
Save me!

1115
01:25:36,666 --> 01:25:39,375
Ground forces.
Ground forces come in.

1116
01:25:39,458 --> 01:25:42,875
Report immediately, what is the
subject's status? Do you read?

1117
01:25:45,125 --> 01:25:46,750
Line to the Doctor.

1118
01:25:46,833 --> 01:25:48,625
We have confirmation
of his recent movements

1119
01:25:48,708 --> 01:25:50,000
and are in pursuit.

1120
01:25:50,083 --> 01:25:52,625
His present position is-- Ha-- 

1121
01:25:52,708 --> 01:25:57,583
coordinates 99871 by 4332.

1122
01:25:57,666 --> 01:25:59,125
That's about
two kilometers south of

1123
01:25:59,208 --> 01:26:01,541
the Olympic construction site
in the old city.

1124
01:26:01,625 --> 01:26:02,833
What?!

1125
01:26:08,083 --> 01:26:10,375
Where did that blast come from?

1126
01:26:10,458 --> 01:26:13,750
Look! That must be out
over at the tollbooth

1127
01:26:13,833 --> 01:26:16,291
guarded by the second platoon.

1128
01:26:17,916 --> 01:26:19,541
What the hell?

1129
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:25,458
Please turn around now. This
area is off limits to civilians.

1130
01:26:25,541 --> 01:26:28,791
Huh? What? That's the
escaped subject? Stop!

1131
01:26:28,875 --> 01:26:30,041
Don't come any closer!

1132
01:26:30,125 --> 01:26:31,375
Stop dammit!

1133
01:27:37,333 --> 01:27:39,916
Hmm. Nice place you have here,
isn't it?

1134
01:27:41,708 --> 01:27:42,625
Huh?

1135
01:27:47,458 --> 01:27:50,291
You were the girl
that was with Kaneda.

1136
01:27:50,375 --> 01:27:55,125
You shouldn't use your power in
this way for it is not correct.

1137
01:27:55,208 --> 01:27:56,500
What's that?

1138
01:27:56,583 --> 01:27:59,083
Because in the end you won't
be able to control it

1139
01:27:59,166 --> 01:28:01,000
and it will control you.

1140
01:28:01,083 --> 01:28:04,583
It's the kids talking.
You're those brats, right?

1141
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,375
Nice one.

1142
01:28:56,541 --> 01:28:59,958
Wait, Colonel.
It's not safe here.

1143
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,708
Alright now, next move.

1144
01:31:10,416 --> 01:31:12,250
Open now!

1145
01:31:22,708 --> 01:31:25,000
What the hell is this?

1146
01:31:25,083 --> 01:31:27,583
That is Akira
before you, Tetsuo.

1147
01:31:27,666 --> 01:31:30,958
That's the Akira you wanted
to meet. There is your messiah.

1148
01:31:31,041 --> 01:31:33,833
The chosen one that
you've been looking for.

1149
01:31:33,916 --> 01:31:36,416
Not long after
his transcendental awakening,

1150
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:38,083
his organs and tissues
were subjected

1151
01:31:38,166 --> 01:31:39,916
to ever test known
to modern science.

1152
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,916
He's dead. That's it.
What you see now lying there

1153
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,708
is all that's left of him.

1154
01:31:54,708 --> 01:31:56,666
And all of the
scientists back then

1155
01:31:56,750 --> 01:31:58,583
were unable
to solve the mystery,

1156
01:31:58,666 --> 01:32:01,083
so they decided to trust
all their collective data

1157
01:32:01,166 --> 01:32:03,291
and test samples
to future generations

1158
01:32:03,375 --> 01:32:06,375
by preserving them in frozen
capsules and locking them away.

1159
01:32:08,875 --> 01:32:10,791
SOL. We will use SOL.

1160
01:32:13,583 --> 01:32:16,583
Akira has been dead all this
time and now you know the truth.

1161
01:32:16,666 --> 01:32:19,666
Well, are you
satisfied now, Tetsuo?

1162
01:32:24,583 --> 01:32:27,041
Now, will you return with us?

1163
01:32:27,125 --> 01:32:29,208
Like hell!

1164
01:32:29,291 --> 01:32:32,166
Contact the Central Defense
Center, and tell them

1165
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:34,291
to patch us through into
SOL's major control curcuits,

1166
01:32:34,375 --> 01:32:34,958
right away!

1167
01:32:35,041 --> 01:32:35,791
Yes, sir.

1168
01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:49,333
Asshole! Watch it.

1169
01:32:53,125 --> 01:32:54,250
Hey, watch it jerk.

1170
01:32:54,333 --> 01:32:58,291
Dammit, move!
Get out of the way. Move it.

1171
01:33:14,833 --> 01:33:17,541
What is this?
A science classroom?

1172
01:33:34,541 --> 01:33:37,541
What's wrong?
Have some trouble?

1173
01:33:37,625 --> 01:33:42,500
Yeah, but I already took care
of it. And you're too late,

1174
01:33:42,583 --> 01:33:43,583
you missed the show.

1175
01:33:43,666 --> 01:33:46,416
Tetsuo, you had me
worried again.

1176
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:49,541
I figured you'd be standing here
sobbing like a little baby.

1177
01:33:49,625 --> 01:33:54,291
Kaneda, you've always been
a pain in the ass you know.

1178
01:33:54,375 --> 01:33:57,083
You've been telling me what
to do since we were kids.

1179
01:33:57,166 --> 01:33:59,666
You always treat me like a kid.

1180
01:33:59,750 --> 01:34:02,375
You always show up and
start bossing me around

1181
01:34:02,458 --> 01:34:04,208
and don't you deny it.

1182
01:34:04,291 --> 01:34:08,125
And now you're a boss too...
of this pile of rubble.

1183
01:34:08,208 --> 01:34:09,750
Kaneda!

1184
01:34:09,833 --> 01:34:12,500
That's mister Kaneda
to you, punk!

1185
01:34:24,333 --> 01:34:25,750
Tetsuo!

1186
01:34:49,583 --> 01:34:51,250
Son of a bitch.

1187
01:35:04,541 --> 01:35:05,625
Kay!

1188
01:35:07,541 --> 01:35:08,625
Aww dammit.

1189
01:35:12,625 --> 01:35:14,583
Let's do it.

1190
01:35:25,791 --> 01:35:27,375
Haha, gotcha!

1191
01:35:28,583 --> 01:35:29,458
What?

1192
01:35:29,541 --> 01:35:30,958
Huh?

1193
01:35:34,291 --> 01:35:36,125
The damn battery's dead.

1194
01:35:36,208 --> 01:35:38,000
What's the matter now Kaneda?

1195
01:35:38,083 --> 01:35:44,166
Ah dammit! It aint fair, Tetsuo.
Fight with your bare hands.

1196
01:35:46,916 --> 01:35:48,333
Oh, this is funny.

1197
01:35:50,291 --> 01:35:53,375
Feeling frustrated, Kaneda?
Now do you understand

1198
01:35:53,458 --> 01:35:56,208
how it feels being
little and helpless?

1199
01:35:57,583 --> 01:35:59,958
Huh?

1200
01:36:00,041 --> 01:36:04,583
Huh? Where's this
light coming from?

1201
01:36:15,041 --> 01:36:16,166
Were we on target?

1202
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:17,958
Hard to tell, too close
to the impact point.

1203
01:36:18,041 --> 01:36:19,333
The montiors are getting
too much electrical--

1204
01:36:19,416 --> 01:36:20,916
Prepare a second volley, now.

1205
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:48,166
Hey! Ka-ne-da!

1206
01:37:06,458 --> 01:37:10,000
Tetsu-- eh?

1207
01:37:24,666 --> 01:37:26,083
Shit!

1208
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Huh? What tha?

1209
01:38:04,916 --> 01:38:06,583
Correcting error now
on tracking system.

1210
01:38:06,666 --> 01:38:07,666
T-minus 20--

1211
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:09,208
Ahh!

1212
01:38:09,291 --> 01:38:11,291
Get the fire extinguishers!
Are you ok? Get the fire out!

1213
01:38:11,375 --> 01:38:13,666
What's going on?
What happened out there?

1214
01:38:22,458 --> 01:38:23,916
Kaneda!

1215
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,166
Wha? Kai! Kay!

1216
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:27,833
Kaneda!

1217
01:38:27,916 --> 01:38:28,708
Kaneda hurry!

1218
01:38:28,791 --> 01:38:30,333
Get on! Get on!

1219
01:38:30,416 --> 01:38:31,541
Hurry!

1220
01:38:54,833 --> 01:38:55,958
What is that?

1221
01:39:10,541 --> 01:39:11,791
Reports say it's SOL.

1222
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:25,291
Magnificent.

1223
01:39:34,875 --> 01:39:36,916
When Tetsuo's power
reaches it's peak?

1224
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,833
Is that what you're thinking?

1225
01:39:38,916 --> 01:39:43,916
That's when we do it,
but will it really work?

1226
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,708
We know the future
doesn't necessarily

1227
01:39:46,791 --> 01:39:49,041
proceed along a single course.

1228
01:39:49,125 --> 01:39:51,250
There ought to be
a future we can choose.

1229
01:39:51,333 --> 01:39:53,166
It's up to us to find it.

1230
01:40:02,875 --> 01:40:04,541
What's Tetsuo's status, Doctor?

1231
01:40:04,625 --> 01:40:08,333
Ah, Colonel. We set up
a camera in the stadium

1232
01:40:08,416 --> 01:40:09,916
if you want to check.

1233
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,916
We have him under observation.

1234
01:40:13,208 --> 01:40:16,666
Colonel, you must take a look
at this data. It's phenomenal!

1235
01:40:16,750 --> 01:40:19,333
We're still analyzing the energy
given off by the subject

1236
01:40:19,416 --> 01:40:21,291
but it's just magnificent!

1237
01:40:21,375 --> 01:40:24,750
Oh yes, wonderful.
Of course, this is clearly

1238
01:40:24,833 --> 01:40:26,208
a proton collapse.

1239
01:40:26,291 --> 01:40:28,416
We're also detecting a fair
number of what we believe

1240
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:30,750
to be unknown
particles to science.

1241
01:40:30,833 --> 01:40:32,208
If we could put this into

1242
01:40:32,291 --> 01:40:35,375
a theoretical framework then
physics, quantum physics,

1243
01:40:35,458 --> 01:40:38,875
humanity itself could know
the fundamental truths--

1244
01:40:41,458 --> 01:40:44,333
Well, you see...
w-we still haven't finished

1245
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:47,333
making out adjustments.
W-Wait Colonel! Please!

1246
01:40:51,916 --> 01:40:54,708
What tha? The pattern!

1247
01:40:57,708 --> 01:40:59,958
You bastard,
what did I tell you?

1248
01:41:00,041 --> 01:41:02,833
But Colonel,
I couldn't throw away such

1249
01:41:02,916 --> 01:41:05,500
a magnificent subject--

1250
01:41:05,583 --> 01:41:06,833
Shut up!

1251
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:32,375
Oh! Oh shit, it's on fire!
My bike!

1252
01:41:32,458 --> 01:41:33,791
Quick, the battery!
The battery!

1253
01:41:33,875 --> 01:41:35,500
Oh, come on it's burning up!

1254
01:41:36,833 --> 01:41:39,250
Hey, what's losing
a bike or two, huh?

1255
01:41:39,333 --> 01:41:43,291
What? Then there's nothing wrong
with using yours, right?

1256
01:41:43,375 --> 01:41:44,458
I said that out loud did I?

1257
01:41:44,541 --> 01:41:45,708
Yeah, you did.

1258
01:41:45,791 --> 01:41:47,250
Uh, by the way your bike's
still on fire.

1259
01:41:47,333 --> 01:41:49,708
Huh? Oh! Oh man.

1260
01:42:29,375 --> 01:42:31,083
Tetsuo?

1261
01:42:42,708 --> 01:42:46,916
Tetsuo, why is everyone calling
you Akira? What does it mean?

1262
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:51,458
It means nothing.
He never existed.

1263
01:42:51,541 --> 01:42:53,833
It doesn't matter who he is,
they don't care

1264
01:42:56,375 --> 01:42:59,125
just so long as
he destroys things.

1265
01:42:59,208 --> 01:43:01,791
What's that? Your arm!
Look at it!

1266
01:43:01,875 --> 01:43:05,833
Well, it doesn't look like much
but it still works pretty good.

1267
01:43:08,875 --> 01:43:10,958
What's wrong? Are you ok?

1268
01:43:13,291 --> 01:43:15,166
It's nothing!

1269
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:16,125
Tetsuo, I just--

1270
01:43:16,208 --> 01:43:18,458
Shut up! Just go away!

1271
01:43:25,458 --> 01:43:26,625
Medicine.

1272
01:43:27,708 --> 01:43:31,208
What's wrong, Tetsuo?
Are you in pain?

1273
01:43:31,291 --> 01:43:34,916
Go back to the lab
and get that medicine.

1274
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,916
Doctor, did you hear that?

1275
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,333
I did, Colonel.

1276
01:43:38,416 --> 01:43:40,083
Well, any signs of it?

1277
01:43:41,083 --> 01:43:43,958
Well I can't be entirely certain
here, but it seems that

1278
01:43:44,041 --> 01:43:46,083
the power which had been
held back by the drugs

1279
01:43:46,166 --> 01:43:47,375
is breaking free.

1280
01:43:47,458 --> 01:43:49,125
He may not be able
to control the power

1281
01:43:49,208 --> 01:43:51,000
that has awakened so suddenly.

1282
01:43:51,083 --> 01:43:53,500
He's in an extremely
critical condition.

1283
01:43:54,833 --> 01:43:57,625
Come back to the lab
and receive proper treatment.

1284
01:43:57,708 --> 01:43:59,041
If you don't you may die.

1285
01:44:02,333 --> 01:44:04,041
You want me to enroll
in your kindergarten

1286
01:44:04,125 --> 01:44:06,000
and live happily
ever after, huh?

1287
01:44:06,083 --> 01:44:07,916
Be quiet and do
what you're told?

1288
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,083
Take your medicine every day
and end up all shriveled

1289
01:44:10,166 --> 01:44:11,625
like those kids?

1290
01:44:16,916 --> 01:44:20,083
Kaori. Kaori!

1291
01:44:22,041 --> 01:44:25,000
Medicine, please.

1292
01:44:25,083 --> 01:44:26,666
N-No.

1293
01:44:26,750 --> 01:44:28,375
Stop Tetsuo!

1294
01:44:29,791 --> 01:44:30,958
Tetsuo!

1295
01:44:33,333 --> 01:44:34,500
Tets--

1296
01:45:06,166 --> 01:45:07,375
Kaneda!

1297
01:45:54,541 --> 01:45:57,333
Son of a-- Huh?

1298
01:46:00,083 --> 01:46:02,333
What are you three doing here?

1299
01:46:08,458 --> 01:46:10,291
You didn't learn
your lesson, huh?

1300
01:46:12,583 --> 01:46:14,041
Heads up, Tetsuo!

1301
01:46:28,583 --> 01:46:30,000
Takashi!

1302
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:33,958
Akira's here.

1303
01:46:47,250 --> 01:46:51,458
Help! Kaneda, help please!

1304
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,625
Kaori.

1305
01:47:05,750 --> 01:47:09,083
Please. Help me.

1306
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:14,250
Help me!

1307
01:47:22,166 --> 01:47:23,708
Let her go!

1308
01:47:41,125 --> 01:47:44,833
Kaori. Kaori. Kaori!

1309
01:47:44,916 --> 01:47:47,541
Tetsuo! Are you there?

1310
01:47:47,625 --> 01:47:50,750
Kaori. Kaori's gonna die!

1311
01:47:50,833 --> 01:47:53,541
What? What did you say?

1312
01:47:53,625 --> 01:47:57,166
My body's not doing
what I tell it to.

1313
01:47:57,250 --> 01:47:59,291
My power's acting on it's own.

1314
01:47:59,375 --> 01:48:01,041
Kaori! Ah!

1315
01:48:02,291 --> 01:48:06,125
Kaori's dying. Kaneda. Help me.

1316
01:48:06,208 --> 01:48:10,208
Stop this, Tetsuo! Stop it now!

1317
01:48:10,291 --> 01:48:15,833
Kaori's pain...
is coming into me. Ahh!

1318
01:48:15,916 --> 01:48:18,375
Tetsuo!

1319
01:48:18,458 --> 01:48:22,125
Kaneda! Run away!

1320
01:48:35,875 --> 01:48:38,250
Tetsuo!

1321
01:48:49,125 --> 01:48:52,958
Kiyoko, Takashi, Masaru!
Hurry, get away from here!

1322
01:48:57,208 --> 01:48:58,333
Come on.

1323
01:49:04,541 --> 01:49:07,750
I can't believe it.
It's as if--

1324
01:49:20,458 --> 01:49:23,166
Kiyoko! Taka--

1325
01:49:57,625 --> 01:50:01,583
Hi. Akira.

1326
01:50:10,083 --> 01:50:12,291
Oh no. That's the--

1327
01:50:13,291 --> 01:50:15,041
But that's impossible!

1328
01:50:25,208 --> 01:50:26,833
W-Where am I?

1329
01:50:27,833 --> 01:50:31,750
Hurry. Get into the tunnel.
You'll be safe in there.

1330
01:50:31,833 --> 01:50:34,000
Kiyoko. Where are you?

1331
01:50:48,291 --> 01:50:50,000
Tetsuo!

1332
01:50:50,083 --> 01:50:52,625
Kaneda!

1333
01:50:52,708 --> 01:50:54,291
Hang on!

1334
01:50:56,208 --> 01:50:57,791
Hurry, you gotta
get out of here.

1335
01:50:57,875 --> 01:50:59,541
Go away.

1336
01:50:59,625 --> 01:51:00,541
Tetsuo!

1337
01:51:00,625 --> 01:51:02,416
Don't go near it!

1338
01:51:08,708 --> 01:51:11,208
No don't! Wait, Takashi!

1339
01:51:11,291 --> 01:51:14,916
If you went in now you'd
be trapped along with him.

1340
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:19,083
But he-- none of this
is his fault at all.

1341
01:51:26,166 --> 01:51:27,166
Takashi!

1342
01:51:27,250 --> 01:51:28,833
Takashi!

1343
01:51:35,166 --> 01:51:39,625
If we went in there
we wouldn't be strong enough

1344
01:51:39,708 --> 01:51:41,458
to come back out again.

1345
01:51:42,541 --> 01:51:46,625
But if the three of us tried,
maybe we could save that boy.

1346
01:51:46,708 --> 01:51:50,166
You're right. Us three together.

1347
01:51:59,291 --> 01:52:03,083
Look at that. We should get out
of here now. H-Hey!

1348
01:52:04,541 --> 01:52:06,250
Kaneda's in there.

1349
01:52:39,166 --> 01:52:42,375
You see that? You're not revving
your engine enough already.

1350
01:52:42,458 --> 01:52:47,250
When you go into a corner,
lean in suicidally. Watch.

1351
01:52:47,333 --> 01:52:48,666
What the hell do you call that?

1352
01:52:48,750 --> 01:52:51,000
Cornering, man.

1353
01:52:51,083 --> 01:52:52,583
You got it, Tetsuo?

1354
01:52:59,708 --> 01:53:01,750
Hey look,
they brought another kid.

1355
01:53:01,833 --> 01:53:03,500
Is he a transfer student?

1356
01:53:03,583 --> 01:53:04,958
His mom and dad left him.

1357
01:53:05,041 --> 01:53:07,041
You can see it in his face.

1358
01:53:10,083 --> 01:53:13,458
Are these-- Are these all of
your dreams and memories,

1359
01:53:13,541 --> 01:53:15,166
Tetsuo?

1360
01:53:16,208 --> 01:53:17,875
W-Wait!

1361
01:54:35,166 --> 01:54:37,958
Is this Akira?

1362
01:54:38,041 --> 01:54:41,291
Yes. We called him here
to the three of us.

1363
01:54:41,375 --> 01:54:43,875
He's going to
take Tetsuo with him.

1364
01:54:43,958 --> 01:54:47,083
Take him where? Where?

1365
01:54:47,166 --> 01:54:51,208
It's too much for Tetsuo.
And for the three of us also.

1366
01:54:51,291 --> 01:54:53,000
And Akira, too.

1367
01:54:53,083 --> 01:54:56,791
It's way too big for us
as we are now.

1368
01:54:56,875 --> 01:55:00,625
But someday we ought
to be able to--

1369
01:55:00,708 --> 01:55:04,166
because it has already begun.

1370
01:55:04,250 --> 01:55:06,625
Your friend, she's--

1371
01:55:06,708 --> 01:55:12,458
My friend. Kay. It's Kay
you're talking about.

1372
01:55:37,875 --> 01:55:39,666
Tetsuo.

1373
01:55:44,125 --> 01:55:45,750
This is yours, right?

1374
01:55:51,916 --> 01:55:54,791
They're always like that
with the new kids.

1375
01:55:54,875 --> 01:55:57,041
Hey, you came today, right?

1376
01:55:57,125 --> 01:56:01,166
They beat me up too. But the
truth is, those guys are wimps.

1377
01:56:01,250 --> 01:56:07,291
My name is...
Tetsuo. Tetsuo Shima.

1378
01:56:07,375 --> 01:56:12,291
The truth is, I just got here
myself. My name is--

1379
01:56:12,375 --> 01:56:17,958
Kaneda. Kaneda. Kaneda!

1380
01:56:18,041 --> 01:56:19,333
Kay.

1381
01:56:45,791 --> 01:56:49,416
What in the world is
happening? What's this?

1382
01:56:51,541 --> 01:56:56,208
This is-- If this is correct,
it's showing that this

1383
01:56:56,291 --> 01:56:58,708
is the birth of the universe!

1384
01:57:04,458 --> 01:57:07,125
Kay!

1385
01:57:13,208 --> 01:57:19,583
What's going on here? Ahh!
Disappearing. It's disappearing!

1386
01:58:30,416 --> 01:58:32,750
Kaneda can you hear me?

1387
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,166
Tetsuo.

1388
01:59:00,500 --> 01:59:02,333
Kaneda, what is--?

1389
01:59:03,500 --> 01:59:04,750
Thank you.

1390
01:59:04,833 --> 01:59:06,083
Huh?

1391
01:59:06,166 --> 01:59:09,625
You called me, didn't you?
And I heard you.

1392
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:19,375
Kaneda. Oh my.

1393
01:59:19,458 --> 01:59:21,000
Where's Tetsuo?

1394
01:59:22,125 --> 01:59:28,166
He just left. Those kids
did too. Akira also.

1395
01:59:28,250 --> 01:59:30,583
Kaneda, back then--
Did you just--?

1396
01:59:30,666 --> 01:59:38,916
Kaneda! You're alive!
I thought you were in there.

1397
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,333
I thought you were
in there for sure.

1398
01:59:44,625 --> 01:59:49,125
Tetsuo! What happened to
Tetsuo? Is he-- dead?

1399
01:59:49,208 --> 01:59:52,458
I'm not sure. S-Something--

1400
02:00:18,458 --> 02:00:22,291
But someday
we ought to be able to--

1401
02:00:22,375 --> 02:00:25,625
because it has already begun.

1402
02:00:43,458 --> 02:00:46,875
I am. Tetsuo.
