And so, in the end, through his heroic efforts to capture the criminals, this iconic

00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:58,324
symbol of peace, the Statue of Justice, was saved, thanks to Mr. Legend.

This is Hero TV breaking news! Masked thugs have highjacked armored truck in West Silver

00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:10,690
and are on the run with over 3 million Stern Dollars.

11
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,863
Unbelievable! They took out a police cruiser!

12
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:21,467
It doesn't look like the authorities can stop these blood thirsty criminals.

And yet, there is still no sign of any heroes.

The only rescue entertainment show that ranks vigilantes by points, and at the end of

It's the bourgeois, open flame broiled Fire Emblem!

21
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,339
Will he bring the heat for another arrest today?

A-camera, push in close!

I'm all over it.

He's gonna use his fireball attack!

What a merciless move!

The suspects are losing control of the vehicle!

Don't even think about it! Hold o-- come here!

Oh, no!

As usual, the hidden hero Origami Cyclone can be seen in the background.

00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,777
And so... another crime prevented by--

00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:00,593
the remaining suspect has taken control of a crowded monorail!

So, what now? We should probably pull out and not interfere.

Hold the phone! It appears Wild Tiger is activating his Hundred Power!

00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:53,806
It's a basic rule! A hero's secret identity has to remain a secret---

169
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,241
Secret, huh?

170
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,175
Uh...

171
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,644
Time's are changin', old man. Better keep up.

172
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,412
Old man?

173
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,491
This is it! The moment you've all been waiting for...

174
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:18,164
... we're about to reveal the winner of this season's Hero TV!

175
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:26,739
What were you thinking, Kotetsu?

176
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:32,545
I mean, bending the track? And did you have to smash the windows in the train like that?

177
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:33,812
Well...

178
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,348
Do you realize how much that's gonna cost?

179
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,516
Listen, I'm sorry.

180
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,554
You do understand who made you a hero, don't you, pal?

181
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:44,223
Hmm... my sponsors, sir!

182
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:48,427
Good answer. Now, get to that award ceremony.

183
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,628
Thanks, Ben.

184
00:13:51,463 --> 00:14:00,239
Fire Emblem. Rock Bison. Dragon Kid. Origami Cyclone. Sky High. Blue Rose. Wild Tiger.

185
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:03,309
Which hero shined the brightest this season?

186
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,276
You're late.

187
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,911
So, when are they gonna announce the winner?

188
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,313
Right now.

189
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,247
All right.

190
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,748
We know it's not gonna be you.

191
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:10,716
Shut up.

[chuckling]

193
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:15,988
The points have been tallied and it's time to crown a new champion!

194
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:21,360
One of these fearless heroes is a heartbeat away from winning all the glory!

195
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:33,472
With an unprecidented 12,730 points, the King of Heroes is Sky High!

196
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:36,408
And now... your Champion!

197
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:41,981
I could not have done this without everyone's help. Thanks and thanks again!

198
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:53,292
Now, with an important message, here is the CEO of Apollon Media,

199
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:57,830
as well as the president of the OBC, give it up for Albert Maverick!

200
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:04,603
I'd like to take a moment to introduce someone very special to our viewers. Come on up.

201
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:12,811
This bright young man has just won the approval of the Justice Buearau.

202
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:15,581
So you'll all be seeing a lot more of him.

203
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:21,153
Please welcome the City of Sternbild's newest hero... Barnaby Brooks Jr.

00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,457
[mocking] What a clown.

Be nice.

206
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:29,461
His super power may sound familiar to some of you.

207
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:34,166
When activated, this young man's physical strength is increased one hundred times.

208
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:40,472
But it only lasts him for five minutes. And yes, it's the exact same power as Wild Tiger.

209
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,175
However, he also has the power of youth.

210
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:49,448
Which is why I'm hopeful our new hero won't need to be rescued as often as someone else we know.

You're not listening. My catch phrase is stupid. Can't your company let me change it?

00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,631
Actually, this thing is really cool.

328
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,635
There you are. Let's do this.

329
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,504
There is one other thing.

330
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:35,674
We've decided to partner you up with another hero.

331
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,342
Huh?

332
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:41,379
Apollon Media is going to sell it as the first ever super hero duo to take the stage.

333
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:42,881
Nobody asked me about that.

334
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:45,750
That's because you don't have a say in the matter.

335
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,252
[groaning]

336
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:52,224
Where's my teammate, anyway?

337
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,759
[screaming]

338
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:58,964
Damn, that hurt. Guess I can't take this guy alone.

339
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,032
What?! It's you?!

340
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:06,838
Hold on. They're pairing me with you, Rock Bison?!

341
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,073
Say what?!

342
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:12,010
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Apollon wants you to be my partner.

343
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:20,518
You gonna talk all day, old man? Or are we gonna get to work?

344
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,621
[grunting] No way!

345
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,224
Chaser change!

346
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:31,897
Double chaser!

347
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:36,401
Hey, how come I'm stuck in the side car?!

348
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:38,336
I think it suits you well.

349
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,171
Yeah, dream on.

350
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,606
Take it up with our sponsor.

351
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,841
[grunting]

352
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:08,333
I'll handle this area, you all go on ahead!

353
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:19,544
What are we gonna do, sit here and watch?

354
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:25,116
We don't wanna just rush in at the same time. We've got to time our entrance for maximum effect.

355
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:27,852
[sighing] What a clown.

356
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,387
Excuse me?

357
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:34,659
That's a brilliant idea. Why don't we wait until the whole city's destroyed?!

358
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,361
A real hero doesn't time his entrances!

359
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:37,762
Okay, show time!

360
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:40,966
We are ready to go live, everyone, so good luck!

361
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:43,268
In 3... 2...

362
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:47,839
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to 'Hero TV Live'!

363
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:53,278
Stern Bild's seven major companies now have exclusive rights over the Heroes!

364
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:57,449
As many of you are already aware, we're starting fresh under a new management system,

365
00:26:57,482 --> 00:27:02,354
and we have great expectations! The question is, which Hero will win the honor of

366
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:04,155
becoming King this season?!

367
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,159
Okay, time to move.

368
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:12,831
You sure? Don't wanna touch up your makeup or--

369
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,065
Sorry!

370
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,601
Hey. What the---?

371
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:21,873
And look who's just arrived! Now, we can really get this party started!

372
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:29,514
My ice is a little cold, but your crime has been completely put on hold!

373
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:32,083
Blue Rose! That crime fighting hottie!

374
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:35,820
But hold onto your hats, it's not just her body that's naughty!

375
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:39,524
Yes! I made it into the shot!

376
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:42,360
This is ridiculous. That's not how-- huh?!

377
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:46,898
Hey! I thought we were a team!

378
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:52,003
I'll show you how to bring this thing down!

379
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,204
Yeah? Good luck with that.

380
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:56,041
I'm gonna have to drop a line on this little guy.

381
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,981
Huh? What's wrong with the damn thing?!

382
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:06,184
Whoooaa!

383
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:13,091
See? Watch and learn, kid. Hey! Where'd he go?!

384
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:17,829
Is that who I think it is?

385
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:22,500
Yes! It's our new fan favorite! Barnaby Brooks Jr.!

386
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,502
Heh.

387
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:28,339
Heh. Man, I hate that. Okay, big guy!

388
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,076
You're goin' down.

389
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:38,450
What the hell?

390
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:39,984
Gotcha.

391
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,487
Huh?

392
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,023
[screaming]

393
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,359
[struggling]

394
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:52,730
[grunting]

395
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:54,766
Great plan, worked out real well!

396
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,268
Well, maybe if you hadn't gotten in the way!

397
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,540
Oh, great.

398
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,009
[screaming]

399
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:10,615
I'm tellin' ya, I can't work with this guy!

400
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:15,687
Well, I must admit, your debut as a team was hardly a rousing success.

401
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,622
In fact, I thought we'd seen the last of you.

402
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:19,023
Uh...

403
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:21,593
It was just lucky for you that that thing ran out of gas.

404
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:25,029
It's a mystery why the rampaging statue suddenly stopped.

405
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:27,966
Or, why hours later, it remains frozen in position.

406
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:31,035
So, do we have any idea who's behind it or what they want?

407
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:33,304
Forget that, you've got bigger problems.

408
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:38,409
You don't seem to understand the situation you're in. You are yesterday's news.

409
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,978
Hey!

410
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:44,182
This offer to be Barnaby's sidekick is your last chance to stay relevant at all!

411
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:45,650
What?!

412
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:48,953
That's right. Sidekick. Backup. Second banana. And you're lucky to get it.

413
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:52,190
Sidekick to that showboat?! That guy's a costume clown!

414
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:55,894
Speaking of costumes, you've got some explaining to do.

415
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:04,536
Hm?

416
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:07,605
[whispering]

417
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,440
What's that?

418
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,610
[whispering]

419
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,579
Suit, eh-- huh?

420
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:18,416
[whispering]

421
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:19,817
Uh-huh, okay.

422
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:22,954
[whispering]

423
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,423
Well, it was my first time.

424
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:33,998
[whispering]

425
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:36,901
Hey, come on, that suit isn't that bad.

426
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,603
[whispering]

427
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:43,408
[groaning]

428
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,024
[groaning]

429
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,631
[groaning]

430
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:13,004
Okay, whoa, whoa! All right, that's enough! I get it, I get it!

431
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:16,541
Ugh, okay, okay, you proved your point.

432
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:18,209
Hehe!

433
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:21,412
Heh, what a weird little guy.

434
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:27,352
[whispering]

435
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,219
Yeah?

436
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,588
[whispering]

437
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,227
You mean this?

438
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:37,462
[whispering]

439
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:48,239
The current time is 3:28PM.

440
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:51,476
[whispering]

441
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:55,913
Is that the time?! Oh, man, I gotta go! I gotta go!

442
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:58,383
[whispering]

443
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:01,953
I swear I'm on my way, I'm just running a little late, that's all!

444
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:03,588
You said you'd be here at 3!

445
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:05,857
I know, honey, I'm sorry!

446
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,792
Are you even coming?

447
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:09,327
What?! Of course I am!

448
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,529
Yeah? When are you gonna be here?

449
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:14,332
Uh, well, umm--

450
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:17,702
Don't worry, Kaede, I'll be there.

451
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,671
When do you actually go on?

452
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:20,571
4?

453
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,073
Okay, plenty of time!

454
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,574
[alarm sounding]

455
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,143
Hang on a second, honey.

456
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:30,214
Calling Tiger and Barnaby. It's showtime! The statue has started moving again!

457
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:33,551
We need you suited up and on the scene right now!

458
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:34,952
[grunting] Kaede?

459
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:37,622
Oh no! I'm starting to get nervous!

460
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:43,328
Dad, you've gotta to hurry up and get over here! I mean it! You've gotta make it!

461
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:50,368
Huh? Oh, how long have you been waiting here?

462
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:53,971
Just 3 and a half minutes of my life that I'm never going to get back...

463
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,373
... but hey, don't worry about it.

464
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:58,710
Oh, boy. How'd I get stuck with you?

465
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:03,414
How will the heroes deal with this giant visitor from the Brox area?!

466
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:11,989
It's showtime! And Blue Rose is the first one to arrive on the scene!

467
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:15,126
All right, you hold it there, buddy!

468
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,928
And there she goes!

469
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:20,365
As you're about to discover, my ice is a little cold...!

470
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:43,721
...But your movements have been completely put on hold!

471
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,128
[screaming]

472
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,170
Her ice was not strong enough to stop him!

473
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,805
You're kidding, right?!

474
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:04,542
[screaming]

475
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,816
It walked right over her Cutie Escape!

476
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,455
If you're going to go and create such a mess...

477
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:23,261
...you should take some personal responsibility. The least you could've done was stop that thing.

478
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:25,363
Just shut up, willya!

479
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:34,539
It looks like the Heroes can't get around to stopping the statue,

480
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,642
because they're too busy saving the civilians!

481
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,180
Here come reinforcements!

482
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:44,816
Hurry, guys! Hurry up!

483
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,150
Okay, boss! We're ready!

484
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,286
Good, now go!

485
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:52,323
Firing in three... two... one...

486
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,861
Rock Bison is on his way!

487
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,131
Yes!

488
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:02,266
He's controlling his direction trajectory by using his shoulder drills!

489
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,003
This looks promising... just a bit outside.

490
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:09,273
[yelling]

491
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:16,481
That was a close call! And a close shave, now that I think about it!

492
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,015
Yeah.. Thanks.

493
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:20,751
[screaming]

494
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:26,691
Look out!

495
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:38,002
[screaming]

496
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,003
Hang on.

497
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:40,238
Huh?

498
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,173
Hmm...

499
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,775
[gasping]

500
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,147
What are you doing?

501
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,615
What do you think?

502
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,415
Just wait a minute.

503
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,151
That thing's got a little kid.

504
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:55,419
Or maybe it's the other way around.

505
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:57,221
What are you--? Get out of my way!

506
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:01,359
Look, maybe it's not the kid who needs saving. You see where I'm goin' with this?

507
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:02,393
No.

508
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:04,495
What if he's the N.E.X.T. controlling the statue?

509
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:06,430
Well, he's still in danger!

510
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,699
Maybe the kid's a N.E.X.T. with telekenetic powers!

511
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:11,736
Well, while you're thinkin' about it, I'm goin' in!

512
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:15,473
I wouldn't be so hasty. Remember what happened last time.

513
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,508
Hey, that was an accident.

514
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:20,411
You know? I'm beginning to seriously question your judgement.

515
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:27,051
I never liked this idea. If the sponsors weren't insisting on it, I'd quit this team right now.

516
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:29,554
That makes two of us.

517
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,291
Uh-oh.

518
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:39,230
[screaming]

519
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:41,432
Don't move or you're all dead!

520
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:48,139
[screaming]

521
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:49,974
[grunting]

522
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:54,979
One move and the kid gets it!

523
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,517
[screaming]

524
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,654
What do ya know?

525
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:09,961
With those powers of yours, you can save people.

526
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,229
Ohhhh.

527
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:15,600
After all, you saved me. That makes you a hero, too.

528
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:19,937
Heh-heh!

529
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:29,280
[grunting]

530
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,685
Have a nice nap, old man?

531
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,688
Funny. You gonna tell me what happened?

532
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,324
The statue grabbed us. And then he stopped again.

533
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:42,860
And you're just sittin' here? Why didn't you escape?

534
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,128
Well, I can't!

535
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:45,062
Huh?!

536
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,697
Without using my power, I mean.

537
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:49,100
Then use it, you idiot. What are you waiting for?!

538
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:52,703
We've only got 5 minutes. I wanna save it until I really need it.

539
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:57,575
Unbelieveable. Well, suit yourself, little bunny. I'm outta here!

540
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,644
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold it.

541
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:00,745
What?!

542
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,981
What did you call me? Did you just call me Bunny?!

543
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:08,052
Yeah, why not? You got those long pink ears and you're always hoppin' around.

544
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:09,720
You're just like a cute little bunny!

545
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:12,490
I am not a bunny! My name is Barnaby!

546
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:15,326
I am not a bunny! I'm a Barnaby!

547
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,560
I don't talk like that!

548
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,562
I don't talk like that!

549
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:22,233
Head's up, you two. We've got another statue heading on a rampage.

550
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:26,037
There's a giant stone lion headed toward the new Morgan District.

551
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,673
What?! That's where the ice rink is!

552
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:31,075
[screaming]

553
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:35,680
[grunting]

554
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,517
You mind getting me out, too?

555
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,885
Huh?

556
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:45,056
Well, I mean, you're all powered up and everything.

557
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:47,825
You're right. I am.

558
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:53,998
Daddy's coming, Kaede!

559
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:59,503

561
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:08,212
Hey, kid! Come on down from there.

562
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:10,147
Stay away!

563
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,983
[roaring]

564
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:15,386
Wait!

565
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:21,392
[grunting]

566
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:31,402
Hey, handsome! You look like you're in a bit of a bind! What's going on up there?

567
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:33,971
Yeah, do you think you can help me out of here?

568
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,306
Hmm...

569
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:39,744
I guess I have no choice. / I can't turn down a hot guy like you!

570
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:53,724
Thank you very much.

571
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:54,892
Hey!

572
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,193
Ohhh!

573
00:39:56,227 --> 00:40:00,164
At least let me palm that little butt! Oh, you're such a tease!

574
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:02,433
[squealing]

575
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,574
Oh-oh, I can't get out of here! Darn!

576
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:18,916

00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:20,785

Kaede! Honey, where are you!

581
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:34,965
Kaede!

582
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,302
Mom, what are you doing?!

583
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:39,870
Kotetsu, thank goodness!

584
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:43,240
It's Kaede! I can't find her!

585
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,076
I think she's still somewhere in this building!

586
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:50,815
Okay! I'll handle it from here! You get outside!

587
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:02,126
[grunting]

588
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,961
This way, folks!

589
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:09,967
Kaede!

590
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:23,247
Noooooo!

591
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:44,134
Kaede...

592
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:50,107
Thank you so much, mister!

593
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,642
[gasping] Huh?!

594
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:55,846
Now, you get on out of here.

595
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,681
I sure will!

596
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:03,587
Hey, um, thanks.

597
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:08,425
Huh? Thanks for what? I didn't save your life, did I?

598
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:09,593
No, but--

599
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:15,299
Help me! Help!

600
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,269
You okay, kid?

601
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:20,337
Stay out of my way.

602
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,605
Why are you doing this, kid?

603
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:24,208
He knows why. He and the others!

604
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:25,743
What do you mean?

605
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:29,346
My whole life, they've hated me and treated me like I was some kind of freak!

606
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:34,852
No, not your whole life. Just since you started to make things move.

607
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:38,822
Normal kinds can't do what you do, I mean, it freaks us out!

608
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:40,858
We don't hate you, we're scared of you!

609
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:44,161
I didn't ask to be given these powers, it's not my fault!

610
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:47,431
[roaring]

611
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:50,935
Slow down, kid. I know just how you feel.

612
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:51,869
No, you don't!

613
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,972
I do, 'cause it happened to me, too.

614
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:58,042
I was about your age when I found out I was a next.

615
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,311
Huh?!

616
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:05,516
My friends turned on me. Called me a freak. I hated them for that.

617
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:08,652
Most of all, I hated my powers.

618
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:14,024
Then a hero called Mr. Legend came along and told me something that changed my life.

619
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:17,962
With those powers of yours, you can save people.

620
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:21,098
My powers can't.

621
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:22,666
Why not?

622
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,170
Because they're not like a real hero's powers. All I can do is make stuff move.

623
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:31,075
Trust me, one day you will find the right use for them. I promise.

624
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:31,875
You mean it?

625
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:33,477
You could be one of the best.

626
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,045
Really?

627
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:39,049
Sure. Now, come on down and let's have the police call your parents.

628
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:42,553
What are you doing? If we don't arrest him, we don't score any points.

629
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:44,288
Oh, shut up, will ya?

630
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:48,158
Okay, kid. You wanna be a hero? This is your first step.

631
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:50,995
What do ya say? You gonna come down?

632
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:01,005
It's gonna be okay, Tony.

633
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:12,816
Watch out! The building's collapsing!

634
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:16,320
I'm on it!

635
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:21,091
Let's go!

636
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:23,427
[laughing]

637
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:29,533
Help me! Somebody!

638
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:32,736
I got it! Save your power.

639
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:39,543
Your powers are still re-charging, right? I should be able to use mine.. Right about now!

640
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:41,945
Damn! Losin' it!

641
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:44,281
Thanks, and thanks again.

642
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:44,815
Uh-oh.

643
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,283
What's wrong, Tiger?

644
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:47,418
I'm out of time.

645
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:48,285
Huh?!

646
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:49,420
My power's about to run out.

647
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:51,422
Well, we've gotta do something!

648
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:52,890
Hey, Tony!

649
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:53,657
Uh!

650
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,426
We can't hold it! It's gonna fall!

651

[screaming]

652
00:44:57,261 --> 00:45:00,931
We need your help, Tony! We need you now!

653
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:02,099
I can't.

654
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:04,968
You can do it! I know you can!

655
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:08,305
I'm down to five seconds.

656
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:12,109
4... 3... 2...

657
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,385
This is terrible!

658
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:23,987
Excuse me. What are you doing?

659
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:26,857
Just watching to see how they handle this situation.

660
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,359
That's sick! What is the matter with you?!

661
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,230
Huh?

662
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:43,140
Heh!

663
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,777
[cheering]

664
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:49,079
Oh thank you! Thank you!

665
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:50,647
Hooray!

666
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:54,051
[cheering]

667
00:45:55,719 --> 00:46:00,524
Unless I'm mistaken, you just saved the day, Tony. Do you know what that means?

668
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:02,626
It means you're a hero.

669
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:04,261
I'm a hero?

670
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,108
Huh?

671
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:20,778
Come on, you have plenty of power left.

672
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:25,048
Huh? Oh, well, what do you know about that?

673
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:31,522
[chuckling] Who'd have thought?

674
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:33,824
Come on, it's time to go home, Kaede.

675
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:36,460
Okay, let's go, Grandma.

676
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:40,030
I'm so glad you're safe. I was really worried.

677
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:54,945
I thought I made myself clear.

678
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:57,748
You're supposed to be Barnaby's backup, his second.

679
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:02,419
I know what you said... But in the heat of all the action, My body moved on its own.

680
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:03,620
You're unbelievable.

681
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,890
What were you thinking, leaving Barnaby behind like that?

682
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:10,494
I tried! But he said he didn't want to activate his powers, so what was I----

683
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:13,697
It's not his call! If he's not participating, you make him!

684
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,632
Okay...

685
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:19,036
Since he's still inexperienced as a Hero, it's your job to help, and give him guidance!

686
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:20,637
What?

687
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:24,875
Isn't it your duty as a veteran, to offer emotional support to the new recruits?

688
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:26,910
I guess...

689
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:30,581
If I can't rely on you for that, there's really no point in keeping you under our employment.

690
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:34,351
The only thing you have going for you, old-timer, is experience.

691
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:38,255
Try to think of something that will help.

692
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:41,992
You know, like trying to create a pleasant work environment for Barnaby?

693
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,393
Are you listening?!

694
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:44,795
Uh...! Yes, sir!

695
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:47,865
I get it.

696
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:51,335
The guy's a loose cannon. I don't think this team thing's gonna work.

697
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:54,872
On the contrary, it's working perfectly.

698
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:56,740
Yes, but--

699
00:47:56,773 --> 00:48:00,077
The two of you have captured people's attention. Viewership is up whenever you're on.

700
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,412
Now's your chance to sell yourself.

701
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:06,016
There's a reason you revealed your true identity to the public.

702
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:11,221
You're not going to let all your careful preparations go to waste, are you, my boy?

703
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:13,056
No, sir.

704
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:17,728
And by continuing this work, you may find a clue to help uncover the meaning behind this symbol.

705
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:21,131
It may lead you to the truth about this person you're after.

[opera music]

708
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:54,097
Don't worry yourself, my boy.

709
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:57,367
We'll find your parents' killer someday. I'm sure of it.

710

[phone ringing]

711
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:24,328
Hey! Don't screen my calls!

712
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:29,833
Do me a favor, and don't waste my time.

713
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:31,368
Oh, man...!

714
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:34,838
Apparently, you're as unfriendly as ever, little Bunny!

715
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:36,673
I told you... Stop calling me that.

716
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:39,142
I have some good news. I've been thinking it over...

717
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:40,844
You'll have to excuse me.

718
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:42,112
Hey! Hear me out!

719
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,981
Want to go grab something to eat?

720
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:48,318
Is this the good news you couldn't wait to tell me? Sorry, but I have stuff to do.

721
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:50,320
Can't you spare a little time?

722
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:51,254
Not really.

723
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:54,324
But everyone is expecting us!

724
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:55,359
What?

725
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,131
Whoa.

726
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:03,867
So what do you think? I'm pretty cut, right?

727
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,670
Amazing! You're completely rock solid!

728
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:10,006
I had no idea. I've only seen you in your Hero suit!

729
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,610
I thought so! Come on, kid. Go ahead and hit me! Give me your best shot!

730
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:16,046
No thanks, I don't want to. It looks like it would really hurt!

731
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,614
Don't be shy!

732
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:19,483
This is really stupid.

733
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,251
Huh?

734
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:24,287
I mean, come on. Why in the world do we have to do have a welcoming party for the rookie?

735
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:26,490
Well, I I think it's a nice gesture!

736
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,058
Huh?

737
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:31,428
He acts aloof, but I think he really wants to get along with his fellow Heroes.

738
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:35,699
You have to admit, he's delightfully mysterious.. and quite good looking.

739
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:41,304
I wouldn't necessarily call him mysterious. I happen to know the guy.

740
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:44,608
As a matter of fact, he was a very popular figure.

741
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:46,877
And he was very well liked at the Hero Academy.

742
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:56,019
Unlike me, he was an excellent student, and everyone at the academy knew who he was.

743
00:50:56,053 --> 00:51:00,190
Well I think it's fun! It's the first time I've ever come to something like this!

744
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,426
Actually, I'm kinda nervous!

745
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:07,697
You're not alone. This is the first time any of us have tried to get together outside of work.

746
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,066
Oh, wow, really?

747
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:12,102
It's a good opportunity. We can get to know each other a lot better.

748
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:16,673
Let's all have fun! Most importantly, let's enjoy!

749
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:17,607
Sounds good to me.

750
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:19,943
If the King of Heroes says so, count me in!

751
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:21,344
his is so annoying.

752
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:23,580
Sorry about that, guys!

753
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:25,215
You're late, Kotetsu.

754
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:28,151
I was busy makin' sure I look good for all of you.

755
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:32,889
Now why would you need to worry about that? It's Barnaby who's the guest of honor.

756
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:33,557
You're right!

757
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,758
Hm?

758
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:38,995
Mr. Wild. Why don't we start by re-introducing ourselves?

759
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,230
Yeah! That sounds good!

760
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,098
Mm-hmm! Hi there!

761
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:43,099
I'll start us off.

762
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:45,035
[applauding]

763
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:48,472
And a good evening to you, handsome. I go by the name 'Fire Emblem'.

764
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:53,577
My real name is Nathan Seymour. I may not look it, but my Helios Energy is my---

765
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,045
You own it, right?

766
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:56,313
Huh?

767
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:58,715
You don't need to explain it to me, I already know.

768
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:00,350
Oh. Really?

769
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:04,120
I see why you're a top student! You've done your homework! That's terrific!

770
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:06,523
Now, why don't we just move right along?

771
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:07,257
Good idea!

772
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,458
Don't bother with your spiel.

773
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:11,127
I've already done my research on you, too.

774
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:13,396
Oh. I see.

775
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:18,802
Hey! This guy's bein' a jerk!

776
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:21,671
Well, he's just socially awkward, I guess!

777
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:25,609
He's probably nervous.. ...being in front of the Heroes he looks up to.

778
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:26,810
I'll be leaving now.

779
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:28,078
W-why?!

780
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:29,880
Going through these introductions is just a big waste of time.

781
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:32,015
Now wait a second, Bunny...!

782
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:33,683
Oh great, well that does it!

783
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:36,353
Just who do you think you are? This is ridiculous.

784
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:40,690
The only reason we came here is because you said that you wanted to get to know us.

785
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:43,426
What?! I never said that. You're mistaken.

786
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:49,099
It was my understanding that this was oganized because you wanted to get to know me.

787
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:51,234
What the heck's going on here, Mr. Wild?

788
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:55,305
You're the one who set this up! You said handsome here wanted to meet us!

789
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,908
I was told you wanted to meet me.

790
00:52:57,941 --> 00:53:00,176
Does it matter..? I mean, really?

791
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,411
Kotetsu!!

792
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:03,380
I thought it would be easier for Bunny to fit in.

793
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:06,249
You know, if he was closer with everyone?

794
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:08,818
So, does this mean you lied to us?

795
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:09,786
Sort of...

796
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:10,720
That's appalling.

797
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:12,522
Despicable!

798
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:16,459
Just a minute, everyone! I don't understand what's going on. What the heck is this all about?!

799
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:18,395
I'll explain it to you later!

800
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:22,599
Come on! Don't you think it's a great opportunity for us to get closer as a team?

801
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:25,101
Closer as a team? Are you stupid?!

802
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:27,971
We're all rivals! It's a competition!

803
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:31,641
S'cuse me, I'll be going now.

804
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:35,078
But... Bunny...!

805
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:38,114
What a drag this turned out to be!

806
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:39,416
I'm leaving.

807
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:40,116
Huh?

808
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,451
Hmpf!

809
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,487
Oh...

810
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:46,122
I need to tend to my shuriken.

811
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:48,158
I guess I'll go take John for a walk.

812
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:49,859
No! Wait a second! Huh?

813
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,461
Huh?

814
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:52,262
Huh?

815
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:54,030
Wha---?

816
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,633
Hello, Heroes! Something big just happened in the Stern Medaille area!

817
00:53:56,666 --> 00:54:02,606
A thief has stolen an item worth billions of Stern dollars! You need to head over there right now!

818
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:11,581
Help me, willya?! I'm afraid of the dark!

819
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:14,250
Ah, stop grabbing my butt!

820
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:16,820
Oh, good, I'm not so scared, now.

821
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:20,490
You're scarin' the hell out of me! I'm going on ahead!

822
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:28,031
Transporter! Meet me at the south end of the park, over on Ninth Avenue!

823
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,747
Cool...!

824
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,017
I wonder if my earlobes would stretch out if I tried to wear those.

825
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,485
Huh?

826
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:49,753
Uh, you wanna try them?

827
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:50,954
Uh-uh!

828
00:54:57,761 --> 00:55:00,697
Excuse me. I don't understand. Why are you running?

829
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:03,366
It's faster than walking, isn't it?

830
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:08,038
That's not what I mean.! I thought you could control the wind. Why don't you just fly?

831
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:09,839
I can't!

832
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:13,410
I don't just jump into the air! In order to reach flight speed, I need a jet-pack!

833
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:16,980
You can't fly with just the use of your powers?

834
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:18,081
Right!

835
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:20,417
I just float!

836
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:23,720
Mr. Sky High!

837
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:29,492
Damn it! Today is turning out to be one crummy incident after another!

838
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:16,806
Oh yeah!

839
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:21,010
Ready!

840
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,048
Hah!

841
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,530
Ha!

842
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,670
The suspect is still on the run. He's now taken the Statue of Justice.

843
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:49,773
Huh? Wait a minute, isn't that...?!

844
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:54,611
That's right. It's a symbol of peace that Mr. Legend recovered from some criminals a long time ago.

845
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:59,382
It's a very high-profile piece. So this crook knew exactly what he was stealing.

846
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:03,419
Know what'll happen if he gets away with it? People will lose faith in their Heroes.

847
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:06,823
So make sure you bring it back. It's critical!

848
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:22,438
[humming]

849
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:25,675
[chuckling and humming]

850
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:30,446
Hold it right there!

851
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,949
I don't want to!

852
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:33,950
Fire!

853
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:35,952
Ha!

854
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:38,955
Come back!

855
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:41,257
Waaahooo!

856
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:47,230
The suspect has now evaded police and is on the run. We still don't see any heroes in pursuit.

857
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:49,599
Come on! What's taking them so long?

858
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:51,034
Here they come now!

859
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:56,873
Hold on, everybody! The new team of Tiger and Barnaby is on the scene!

860
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:59,976
Will their teamwork be effective enough to make an arrest?

861
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,915
So that's the theif, huh?

862
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:08,284
Please don't do anything funny, all right?

863
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:12,021
What are you talking about? Just hurry up and catch him, all right?

864
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:17,493
There's a construction barricade up ahead. We're gonna split up.

865
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:18,862
What?!

866
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:28,605
[yelling]

867
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:33,209
Whoa!

868
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,550
Too slow!

869
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:44,053
This is bad! She's after our points!

870
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:58,401
Blue Rose, Barnaby Brooks Jr., and Wild Tiger are all in hot pursuit of the suspect!

871
00:58:58,434 --> 00:59:03,640
They're closing in, but the question is, who will reach the man first?!

872
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:08,845
Now is not the time to be having this little bike race, you guys!

873
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:14,050
Uh-oh!

874
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:23,059
Wait a minute!

875
00:59:23,092 --> 00:59:25,094
Huh?

876
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:31,234
Ladies and gentlemen, the suspect is nowhere to be seen! Where in the world could he have possibly gone?!

877
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:34,904
Damn it, Tiger! It's your fault we lost him!

878
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:37,240
Hey...

879
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:42,578
Did you... see anybody come through here, lady?

880
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:45,715
[giggling]

881
00:59:58,494 --> 00:59:59,195
Yahoo!

882
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:01,197
Hey, you! Come back!

883
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:02,465
What the heck?

884
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:03,666
[screaming]

885
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,269
Didn't think he'd escape into an amusement park!

886
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:10,840
Well... It will make it look more exciting for us.

887
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:17,380
[giggling]

888
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:22,852
Hmmm!

889
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:28,758
There's the suspect! And standing in his way is Rock Bison!

890
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,626
These points are mine!

891
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:34,030
And look! Dragon Kid is here, too!

892
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:35,798
I've got him!

893
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:37,734
Oh no, you don't!

894
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:40,003
Hmm...

895
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:41,971
Hhhhaaaa!

896
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:42,505
Huh?!

897
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:45,875
[struggling]

898
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:49,746
[chuckling] Buh-bye!

899
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:51,647
[groaning]

900
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:53,016
Sorry! Oh!

901
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:03,292
[screaming]

902
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,061
Look out!

903
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:06,963
Mikey!

904
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:10,700
Hurry! Get out of here!

905
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:13,169
Okay! Thank you so much!

906
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:18,775
It looked like they stopped him, so how did this happen?!

907
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:23,246
[chuckling] Hm?

908
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:28,985
And here comes our King of Heroes... Sky High!

909
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:30,620
Hm!

910
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:31,854
Stop where you are!

911
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:35,858
Hm! It's not polite to point!

912
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:40,196
Sky High!

913
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,936
Bye!

914
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:50,473
Wow! What happened here?!

915
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:55,211
Wahooo!

916
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:10,359
Huh?

917
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:17,266
You're not getting away!

918
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:27,610
Well...

919
01:02:27,643 --> 01:02:28,478
Yes!

920
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:30,413
You're a thinker!

921
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:35,818
He truly is the King of Heroes! The wind seems to be blowing in his favor this season!

922
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:39,455
It's the end of the road for you! Now hand over the Statue of Justice!

923
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:42,892
If you want it that badly... then come and get it!

924
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,896
What?!

925
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:49,198
How did he get away?!

926
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:03,513
I think we should put an end to this chase now!

927
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:05,781
Really? Are you sure?

928
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:07,350
What if I don't agree?

929
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:11,921
My ice is a little bit cold... but your crime has been completely...

930
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,456
...put on hold!

931
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:15,725
Girl...! You are takin' too long!

932
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:17,760
Stop interfering!

933
01:03:17,793 --> 01:03:22,698
This is ridiculous! If you have time to say all that, just put him on hold and be done with it!

934
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:25,301
Hey! Don't steal my points!

935
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:29,939
[screaming]

936
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:32,074
You're breaking the rules!

937
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:34,210
No I'm not! That's what you're doing!

938
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:36,946
My word! What in the world just happened?!

939
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:38,114
That's strange...

940
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,216
He shouldn't have been able to dodge that.

941
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,353
Look, daddy, it's Sky High!

942
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:48,424
The Heroes are stalled, and unable to apprehend the suspect!

943
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:50,393
[giggling]

944
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:53,262
Aha! There he is!

945
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:58,167
Not so fast, old man. You promised not to do anything funny.

946
01:03:58,201 --> 01:03:59,001
Huh?

947
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:00,970
Can you define what you mean by funny?

948
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,972
You really are annoying.

949
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:06,909
Okay, smart guy, then what should we do? In case you haven't noticed, he's very quick!

950
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:10,980
No matter how fast he is, he can't escape from us if we activate our powers and

951
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:12,982
flank him from both sides at once.

952
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,250
Actually a good plan.

953
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:16,319
Does that mean you're on board?

954
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:20,189
This is the perfect chance to show people that Heroes can operate as a team.

955
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,325
I don't care what we do, so long as we arrest him.

956
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:26,262
Okay, you go around to the other side. I'll come at him from over here.

957
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:27,230
Right on.

958
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:34,237
[screaming]

959
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:37,406
Oop!

960
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,808
Time to give it up, pal!

961
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:40,876
They assigned me the rookie, huh?

962
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:44,680
It's not just the rookie, smart ass!

963
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:46,315
Now!

964
01:04:57,927 --> 01:04:59,929
What the hell happened?!

965
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:01,664
Where did he go?!

966
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:13,009
That was a pretty good idea! But... I'm afraid it wasn't good enough to catch me!

967
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:15,378
Damn it!

968
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:16,279
Huh?

969
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:20,950
[chuckling]

970
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:32,295
[yelling]

971
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:42,938
Agnes. Barnaby's calling in.

972
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:43,806
What is it?

973
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:46,876
I have a request to make.

974
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:51,881
Listen, everyone. Barnaby has something to tell us. I'm opening up all channels.

975
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:58,087
Hi, this is Barnaby. I think I've figured out the suspect's power. It seems to be location switching.

976
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,622
What the heck is that?

977
01:05:59,655 --> 01:06:03,826
Apparently, he can switch places with anyone in his line of sight.

978
01:06:03,859 --> 01:06:05,227
So that's how he got away!

979
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:07,897
Listen to me. There's something I want all of you to do.

980
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:11,600
Tell me something. Why, exactly, should we listen to you?

981
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:20,843
Oh! I'm sorry!

982
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:21,977
What are you doing?!

983
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:23,579
Just watch.

984
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:26,082
[cackling]

985
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:31,520
We have to be very careful that we don't harm any civilians.

986
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:32,655
What the--- ?

987
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:36,125
Just to remind you, we're Heroes who protect people.

988
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:45,468
Attention visitors. There is a criminal with NEXT powers, loose in the park. Please follow our

989
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:48,604
staff member's directions, while we move you to a safe location.

990
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:52,541
Right this way, folks. Keep a single-file line, please.

991
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:56,078
I had you all wrong, buddy. It seems you do care about the people---

992
01:06:56,112 --> 01:06:57,613
Don't get the wrong idea.

993
01:06:57,646 --> 01:06:59,482
Eh?

994
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:02,952
I came up with this plan so HERO TV's image wouldn't get ruined. And besides, it will make

995
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:05,421
it more difficult for any of the other Heroes to interfere.

996
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:08,691
This gives us me the perfect chance to steal the glory.

997
01:07:08,724 --> 01:07:12,328
Whaaat?! I don't get it. How can you be so petty?

998
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:13,863
You should be thanking me.

999
01:07:13,896 --> 01:07:16,298
Because of this brilliant maneuver, you're gonna stand out.

1000
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:19,001
Hey, hey. Don't pull me into your head trip.

1001
01:07:19,034 --> 01:07:23,038
One problem.. As of now, our power's have have completely run out.

1002
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:25,941
So, we need to make a plan until we recover.

1003
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:27,576
Hey, I've got an idea that's foolproof.

1004
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:28,644
Forget about it.

1005
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:30,079
Hey, listen to me!

1006
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:31,814
I'm sure it's nothing workable.

1007
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:33,716
You haven't even heard it yet!

1008
01:07:33,749 --> 01:07:37,653
And besides, whose plan was it that made us run out of power in the first place?

1009
01:07:37,686 --> 01:07:38,454
What?

1010
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:40,256
Excuse me, but you agreed to it!

1011
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:45,060
No, I didn't! I was planning to go 'Ka-Bang' and then 'Ka-Boom' on this bastard,

1012
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:46,562
and take him out, right from the beginning!

1013
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:48,097
That makes no sense.

1014
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:50,199
I'm saying we should've just gone for it!

1015
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:54,170
If that's the way your mind works, I don't really think your plan's gonna be all that good!

1016
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:58,674
Well I'm not gonna waste my time on some plan made by an egghead like you!

1017
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:00,509
[growling]

1018
01:08:01,977 --> 01:08:03,345
Hey!

1019
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:06,115
Why are you two fighting in the middle of this?!

1020
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:08,417
I've got information from the Justice Bureau!

1021
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:13,389
The man you're chasing is named Robin Baxter. He's an internationally known criminal, and we have

1022
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:16,025
case reports on his activities from many countries.

1023
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:20,763
Amazingly, though, he's never been apprehended. He's gotten away every single time.

1024
01:08:20,796 --> 01:08:23,499
So quit your petty squabbling and focus on the job!

1025
01:08:23,532 --> 01:08:25,901
If you do that again, I'll take points away from you!

1026
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,771
Yes, ma'am.

1027
01:08:28,804 --> 01:08:32,475
The Heroes are now calling on all citizens to evacuate the amusement park.

1028
01:08:33,142 --> 01:08:36,178
Really?

1029
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:37,980
Hey, what's going on?!

1030
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:39,281
Huh?

1031
01:08:39,315 --> 01:08:42,017
We paid a lot of money to come and enjoy this place!

1032
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:45,754
What's the problem? Go catch the guy! Hm?

1033
01:08:46,155 --> 01:08:48,357
Hi, papa!

1034
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:50,426
Get him!

1035
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:52,294
Don't let him get away!

1036
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:55,264
[gasping]

1037
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:56,999
Hey, you all right?

1038
01:08:57,032 --> 01:08:58,133
I'm fine.

1039
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:00,503
Jerkwad.

1040
01:09:00,536 --> 01:09:03,405
Whoa! Whoa!

1041
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:06,775
Did you see that?!

1042
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:08,911
Out of the way!

1043
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:11,580
I got ya! Hey!

1044
01:09:11,614 --> 01:09:14,950
It looks like he's moving toward the exit! Let's head him off!

1045
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:18,754
Huh? Hey, wait a minute, we're not done here yet!

1046
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:21,857
[chuckling] I'm over here!

1047
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:34,670
[laughing] Whooo!

1048
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:35,871
[grunting]

1049
01:09:37,873 --> 01:09:41,243
Ooh! Now the one with the mohawk is chasing me!

1050
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:43,979
What, did you prefer the little bunny instead?!

1051
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:48,284
Waaaahaaa---

1052
01:09:52,154 --> 01:09:54,423
End of the line, pal!

1053
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:59,361
Whew! I think I've burned enough calories for today...

1054
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:03,365
Let's wrap this up, what do you say? There's nowhere to run.

1055
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:08,370
What do you know, I'm being chased by a couple of fools!

1056
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:10,906
Who are you calling a fool, ponytail?!

1057
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:16,412
What the hell?!

1058
01:10:16,445 --> 01:10:18,914
You got a problem? Go ahead, do your little trick!

1059
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:22,551
You can switch places with either one of us. We don't care.

1060
01:10:22,585 --> 01:10:24,687
[laughing]

1061
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:25,988
Uh, wow.

1062
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:29,491
You two boys really are fools!

1063
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:31,860
Aren't you even gonna try to show off?

1064
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:34,363
Huh?

1065
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:38,934
Hey, Tiger and Barnaby! Showing the public how close you are to each

1066
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:41,303
other, isn't going to help you catch the suspect!

1067
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:42,771
[laughing]

1068
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:45,874
Umm. Do you think you could let go of me now?

1069
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:46,909
Oh, sure.

1070
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:48,177
This was your whole plan?

1071
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:50,179
Kinda. I thought he was gonna switch places wi--

1072
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:53,849
Come on, who in their right mind would fall for such a childish trap!

1073
01:10:53,882 --> 01:10:54,984
Yeah...

1074
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:57,219
This is going to make people change the channel.

1075
01:10:57,253 --> 01:11:02,858
Change the channel?! What do think this is all about? We're not out here just to appear on TV!

1076
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:04,059
Yeah, yeah.

1077
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:05,661
Is that all this means to you?!

1078
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:08,530
What was that big act you put on at the plaza?!

1079
01:11:08,564 --> 01:11:10,266
We're supposed to be protecting people!

1080
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:13,268
If you remember, you're the one who told me to put pressure on the perp!

1081
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:14,436
What are you trying to say?!

1082
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:15,271
Not too bright, are ya?!

1083
01:11:15,304 --> 01:11:18,140
They're at it again!

1084
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:22,945
Robin Baxter has committed many crimes around the world, and is a dangerous character.

1085
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:27,883
Even as I speak, the Heroes are in the process of closing off the amusement park,

1086
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:29,818
to keep him from escaping.

1087
01:11:29,852 --> 01:11:34,823
As part of that process, we're seeing the park visitors being led to safety.

1088
01:11:35,924 --> 01:11:39,695
Skyyyyy High!

1089
01:11:39,728 --> 01:11:43,098
Oh-oh! Looks like we're being pushed out, as well!

1090
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:47,970
Ladies and gentlemen, this area is currently closed due to an emergency. Visitors are

1091
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:51,940
to follow orders and move to the exit gates immediately.

1092
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:59,682
[giggling]

1093
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:07,756
Everybody, stay where you are!

1094
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,426
[gasping]

1095
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:16,865
[chuckling]

1096
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:19,435
So there you are!

1097
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:21,670
What are you doing?

1098
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:23,872
I'm trying to catch the guy!

1099
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:25,374
Get as close as you can!

1100
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:27,609
Everyone! Try to form a tight group!

1101
01:12:29,044 --> 01:12:30,813
What's happening here?

1102
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:34,883
Well, you're not very bright, are you? We've completely shut this area off from the outside.

1103
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:36,285
Why?

1104
01:12:36,318 --> 01:12:39,054
If we gather everyone here, he'll be trapped. He won't be able to

1105
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:41,990
escape, no matter who he switches places with!

1106
01:12:42,991 --> 01:12:44,293
Heh!

1107
01:12:44,326 --> 01:12:46,562
Interesting maneuver. Maybe you're not as stupid as I thought.

1108
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:50,499
All we have to do now is come up with a good way to catch him... you know?

1109
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:54,670
Well, I'm sure you will. You guys are pretty smart.

1110
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:59,074
Holding us like this makes no damn sense. I'm getting out of here.

1111
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:05,147
What? Stop that man!

1112
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:08,817
Heh!

1113
01:13:11,186 --> 01:13:13,856
[grunting]

1114
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:15,724
Help me!

1115
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:16,525
[gasping]

1116
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:20,763
Thank you, so much! Goodbye!

1117
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:23,999
Oh, no, he just went out there!

1118
01:13:24,032 --> 01:13:24,867
Damn it!

1119
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,668
Well, so much for following orders.

1120
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:28,203
We need to rescue that guy!

1121
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:31,907
You can handle that job yourself. We need to catch the suspect.

1122
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:34,143
Dad! Dad!

1123
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:35,477
Wait a second...

1124
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:37,346
Dad, hold on!

1125
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:38,881
Don't move, son!

1126
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:39,481
Ah!

1127
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:40,582
[gasping]

1128
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:42,451
Huh?

1129
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,657
Whaat?

1130
01:13:52,194 --> 01:13:53,996
Daddy!

1131
01:14:00,002 --> 01:14:04,606
Sir... From now on, don't let go of your son.

1132
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:08,310
Remember... You're his one and only father.

1133
01:14:08,343 --> 01:14:10,846
And because of that, you're irreplaceable.

1134
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:12,748
I understand.

1135
01:14:14,516 --> 01:14:17,052
Nice work. So, I guess you like kids.

1136
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:18,053
Huh?

1137
01:14:18,086 --> 01:14:20,122
Come on, you did all that for that little boy..

1138
01:14:20,155 --> 01:14:23,025
...Not to mention what you did earlier in the day.

1139
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:30,332
I have to admit.. It's kind of unexpected.

1140
01:14:30,365 --> 01:14:34,536
I was just trying to do my job, that's all.

1141
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:39,441
All right! The Heroes are moving toward the park attraction where Robin Baxter was last seen!

1142
01:14:39,474 --> 01:14:44,313
They usually have things pretty much under control. But this time around, the situation's

1143
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:48,617
very fluid. They don't seem to have a handle on how to deal with this guy yet!

1144
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,385
I have some bad news...

1145
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:53,956
I found out the roller-coaster the suspect escaped to, stretches from the core

1146
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:58,827
of the park to the upper areas of Stern Bild. The long vertical tunnel is split up into the Green

1147
01:14:58,861 --> 01:15:04,967
Zone, the Mirror Zone and the Sky Zone. We've closed off all the emergency exits from the ground to the upper areas,

1148
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:11,540
but if he gets past the Sky Zone, he'll be able to access the entire town from the observation deck.

1149
01:15:11,573 --> 01:15:13,842
So if the suspect makes it all the way up there...

1150
01:15:13,876 --> 01:15:16,845
...he can switch places with anyone in the city.

1151
01:15:16,879 --> 01:15:18,714
Oh, no...!

1152
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:22,084
There's no choice! You have to catch him before he has a chance to reach that observation deck!

1153
01:15:22,117 --> 01:15:25,521
If we don't, he's gonna get away scott-free with the Statue of Justice!

1154
01:15:25,554 --> 01:15:29,258
But as soon as we get near him, he'll just switch places again!

1155
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:32,728
Maybe we should destroy the entire building, and be done with it!

1156
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:35,931
I shudder to think how much we'd have to pay in damages.

1157
01:15:35,964 --> 01:15:39,167
He's a diabolical opponent, for sure.

1158
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:42,671
Ahhhh!

1159
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:47,009
The suspect has just passed the Green Zone, and entered the Mirror Zone!

1160
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,644
What?! Already?!

1161
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:51,013
Don''t pressure us so much! We're trying to come up with a plan, all right?

1162
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:53,248
Damn it! Let's just go and confront the bastard!

1163
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:55,984
I'm tired of this! I'll capture him, man to man!

1164
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:58,153
'Cause that worked so well last time.

1165
01:15:58,186 --> 01:15:59,354
[growling]

1166
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,823
Then you come with me! / I'll provide you with support!

1167
01:16:01,857 --> 01:16:04,259
To be honest, that worries me the most of anything.

1168
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:08,297
What?! And here I was, about to offer to act as your decoy!

1169
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:10,566
[gasping] That's it!

1170
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:12,234
What do you mean? What's it?!

1171
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:13,435
Don't follow me!

1172
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:16,705
Excuse me? Are you nuts? We're supposed to be a team!

1173
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:20,342
I swear. I will capture the suspect.

1174
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:32,220
Hey! Are you just gonna let the rookie go off on his own?

1175
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:42,030
[humming]

1176
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:50,739
Everyone hurry! According to our sensors, Baxter's going to be leaving the Mirror Zone soon!

1177
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:56,878
[humming]

1178
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:05,854
Hm?

1179
01:17:08,323 --> 01:17:09,658
Hmm...

1180
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:14,896
It appears he's about to reach the observation deck!

1181
01:17:15,664 --> 01:17:18,000
What in the world is Barnaby doing?!

1182
01:17:21,336 --> 01:17:25,841
You've been giving us quite a difficult time!

1183
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:30,512
It's over! We're going to take you into custody and put you away for a long time!

1184
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:31,279
Hmpf!

1185
01:17:33,882 --> 01:17:36,952
I don''t think your team is capable of doing that!

1186
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:44,159
We're about to prove you wrong.

1187
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:47,162
Heh!

1188
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,970
Huh? What the---?

1189
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:58,840
What's the matter? Your goal is just up ahead...

1190
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:03,445
[efforts]

1191
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:05,080
[grunting]

1192
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:12,721
Heh!

1193
01:18:19,661 --> 01:18:22,731
All power exhausted in thirty seconds.

1194
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:28,370
Ahhhh!

1195
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:34,409
Damn it! I can't see anything in here!

1196
01:18:37,746 --> 01:18:42,350
[screaming]

1197
01:18:48,423 --> 01:18:50,058
It's over, everyone.

1198
01:18:50,092 --> 01:18:52,360
I've captured Robin Baxter.

1199
01:18:53,528 --> 01:18:56,798
(Cheers

1200
01:18:56,832 --> 01:19:02,237
He's finally done it! The rookie Hero, Barnaby Brooks Jr., has put an end to the latest threat

1201
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:09,745
to the population of this great city! He has also successfully returned the Statue of Justice to Stern Bild!

1202
01:19:09,778 --> 01:19:15,550
[cheering]

1203
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,285
Showed that guy who's boss!

1204
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,156
Wow, that was exciting!

1205
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:23,525
Our numbers are skyrocketing!

1206
01:19:23,558 --> 01:19:25,794
Great! We need to showcase Barnaby!

1207
01:19:25,827 --> 01:19:27,896
Let's make a documentary!

1208
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:32,701
Here's what we've been waiting for... The Heroes are now turning Robin Baxter over to the police!

1209
01:19:32,734 --> 01:19:35,337
This is your idea of justice?

1210
01:19:37,472 --> 01:19:42,444
[humming]

1211
01:19:42,477 --> 01:19:44,346
Huh?

1212
01:19:46,915 --> 01:19:52,521
Hey! Congratulations! You really came through! Great work, Li'l Bunny!

1213
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:55,657
How many times must I tell you not to call me that?

1214
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:58,193
Hey pal, are you really still in a bad mood?

1215
01:19:58,226 --> 01:20:02,297
Just get over it! Isn't it about time we put all this behind us?

1216
01:20:03,331 --> 01:20:05,600
Whoa! Why the look?

1217
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:08,303
What, precisely, did you do today?

1218
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:10,172
Huh?

1219
01:20:10,205 --> 01:20:14,109
I mean, you talked a big game. But in the end, all you really accomplished was getting in my way!

1220
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:16,444
Is that how you really feel?!

1221
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:18,346
Hm?

1222
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:20,482
Good work out there!

1223
01:20:23,585 --> 01:20:24,986
Thanks.

1224
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,955
Yeah, today was a real challenge, no doubt about that!

1225
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:33,261
I wasn't talking to you, Wild Tiger. And you didn't do anything all that challenging, anyway.

1226
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:35,463
What are you talking about? I did stuff!

1227
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:37,899
That... was very impressive.

1228
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:40,202
Keep that up and you'll do well!

1229
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:41,369
Yes sir.

1230
01:20:41,403 --> 01:20:42,938
[groaning]

1231
01:20:44,272 --> 01:20:45,874
I'm just glad you're all right.

1232
01:20:45,907 --> 01:20:48,643
I'm fine, but it was so scary!

1233
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:52,247
I'm sorry honey, I should've been there to protect you.

1234
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:54,382
That's what a dad's for... right?!

1235
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:58,954
Oh, I had plenty of protection, dad! This guy Barnaby saved me!

1236
01:20:58,987 --> 01:21:03,692
He's one of those heroes, you know? Oh, and you should see him. He's so cool!

1237
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:07,395
And really cute. He's my new favorite hero on the show!

1238
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:09,965
[groaning]

1239
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:19,774
[whispering]

1240
01:21:19,808 --> 01:21:21,343
Thanks, I appreciate it.

1241
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:24,679
[whispering]

1242
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:26,882
It was... just instinct.

1243
01:21:26,915 --> 01:21:31,686
[whispering]

1244
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:32,487
Huh?

1245
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:35,523
[whispering]

1246
01:21:37,926 --> 01:21:40,262
I forgot that was running.

1247
01:21:44,933 --> 01:21:47,035
Man...

1248
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:50,672
I've gotta say... You really surprised me yesterday.

1249
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:54,442
Don't follow me!

1250
01:21:54,476 --> 01:21:58,146
I swear... I will capture the suspect.

1251
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:06,221
Hey! Are you just gonna let the rookie go off on his own?

1252
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:09,591
Let me tell you, I have no intention of following his orders!

1253
01:22:09,624 --> 01:22:13,561
If we don't jump in, Handsome's going to steal the best part!

1254
01:22:14,562 --> 01:22:15,530
Hey, wait a minute!

1255
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:16,464
Huh?

1256
01:22:17,365 --> 01:22:19,200
Can we let him handle it this one time?

1257
01:22:23,538 --> 01:22:27,809
See... I kinda wasted three- and- a- half minutes of his life, so I owe him.

1258
01:22:27,842 --> 01:22:29,144
What are you talking about?

1259
01:22:29,177 --> 01:22:30,345
It makes no sense.

1260
01:22:30,378 --> 01:22:31,846
We don't have time for this!

1261
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:32,847
Mr. Wild!

1262
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:34,416
We've gotta move!

1263
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:37,452
Do you have a reason why we should let Handsome do this on his own?

1264
01:22:37,986 --> 01:22:40,055
In fact, I do!

1265
01:22:40,722 --> 01:22:43,491
My gut... says so!

1266
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:44,592
What?!

1267
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:49,030
He may have a small-- Well, he may have a big problem with his personality...

1268
01:22:49,064 --> 01:22:53,168
...But right now...He's trying his very best to capture the suspect.

1269
01:22:53,201 --> 01:22:55,537
As his partner, I'll watch over him!

1270
01:22:55,570 --> 01:23:00,175
If something goes wrong.. I'll take responsibility! Alright?

1271
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:03,678
Until then, let him carry out his plan.

1272
01:23:18,426 --> 01:23:22,030
Please don't do anything funny, all right?

1273
01:23:25,367 --> 01:23:28,403
You promised not to do anything funny...

1274
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:36,244
It's over, everyone.

1275
01:23:39,047 --> 01:23:41,516
I've captured Robin Baxter.

1276
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:44,119
[sighing]

1277
01:23:51,659 --> 01:23:56,898
To be honest, I was really nervous at the end of the operation. I said I would take

1278
01:23:56,931 --> 01:23:59,801
responsibility, but there was nothing I could really do!

1279
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:04,005
Huh? [laughing]

1280
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:07,776
Well.. In spite of everything, he was able to make the arrest.

1281
01:24:07,809 --> 01:24:10,845
So it looks like your faith in him was well-placed.

1282
01:24:13,982 --> 01:24:18,586
[screaming] Whoa! That was close!

1283
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:22,724
The guy never learns.

1284
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:36,337
So, I never got to sing during the broadcast.

1285
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:41,009
Then I went and chipped a nail! By the time I got home, I was so annoyed, I couldn't sleep!

1286
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:43,845
I kept eating ice cream all night!

1287
01:24:43,878 --> 01:24:45,547
Are you blaming me for that?

1288
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:47,615
Of course not! It's your partner's fault!

1289
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:53,221
Yeah, he went and grabbed all the glory for himself. Even if he is a competent Hero, he's never

1290
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:54,656
gonna win any girls that way!

1291
01:24:54,689 --> 01:24:58,226
Well... He was quite popular at the Hero Academy.

1292
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:01,663
As I recall, he even had a fan club.

1293
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:07,035
Well, regardless. I guess all of that still remains to be seen.

1294
01:25:07,068 --> 01:25:10,572
In that case, maybe we should invite him out for another drink!

1295
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:11,573
Huh?

1296
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:14,843
Sure! That welcoming party? Was a total disaster!

1297
01:25:14,876 --> 01:25:18,146
So Wild Tiger says he's going to treat us to another round!

1298
01:25:18,179 --> 01:25:19,514
S'cuse me?!

1299
01:25:19,547 --> 01:25:22,717
Hey... We honored your request to stay out of his way.

1300
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:25,253
Don't you at least owe us a drink for that?

1301
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:27,155
It's nice you're not pushy about it!

1302
01:25:27,188 --> 01:25:29,457
I don't mind going, since he's treating us!

1303
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:30,825
I'm in.

1304
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:33,394
It would be rude to turn you down, since you're so determined!

1305
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:35,163
Thanks, what a generous offer!

1306
01:25:35,196 --> 01:25:36,531
Wait a minute...!

1307
01:25:36,564 --> 01:25:39,367
Can we go someplace where I can get a bowl of miso soup?

1308
01:25:46,107 --> 01:25:48,676
Words beginning with CH.

1309
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:50,211
Okay... chaps!

1310
01:25:50,245 --> 01:25:51,346
Hey! Race you to it!

1311
01:25:51,379 --> 01:25:53,681
Get out of my way!

1312
01:25:53,715 --> 01:25:56,284
[giggling] Hold on!

1313
01:25:56,317 --> 01:25:58,553
[giggling] Hurry, Tiger!

1314
01:26:02,123 --> 01:26:03,958
I know, Tomoe...

1315
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:06,628
Don't worry...

1316
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:11,266
I'll try my best... to find a way for us to work together.

1317
01:26:14,235 --> 01:26:16,204
Mom... Dad...

1318
01:26:16,237 --> 01:26:20,341
I made it. I finally became a Hero.

1319
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:22,310
And I swear...

1320
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:26,915
There'll come a day... when I'll solve your murders.

1321
01:26:26,948 --> 01:26:32,687
I hope it's soon. I must say, though, I'm a little concerned about my partner.

1322
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:38,927
[phone ringing]

1323
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,328
Hmph.

1324
01:26:49,837 --> 01:26:50,705
Hello?
