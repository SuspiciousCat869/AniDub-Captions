to see if we can make contact

Based on accounts,
she's about 20 years old.

She's got long hair
and wears dark clothes.

So if I had to guess,

00:02:17.772 --> 00:02:19.239 position:10% line:89% align:start
she probably looks like this.

sent out the initial email.

Yeah, they sure do.

it was over something
really minor.

[Tomoya] Why?

00:17:23.277 --> 00:17:24.546 position:27% line:83% align:start
Probably to cover
up the accident.
