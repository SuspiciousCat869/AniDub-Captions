1
00:00:34,144 --> 00:00:39,457
<i>When I was a child, I thought the world was... simpler.</i>

2
00:00:39,935 --> 00:00:42,279
<i>I thought there was no challenge that was unbeatable...</i>

3
00:00:42,512 --> 00:00:46,431
<i>That if I tried hard enough, anything was possible.</i>

4
00:00:55,113 --> 00:00:56,923
<i>Everything was cut and dry:</i>

5
00:00:57,756 --> 00:01:00,656
<i>You win, you lose, or it ends in a draw.</i>

6
00:01:05,177 --> 00:01:07,371
I need a way that's more precise...

7
00:01:07,498 --> 00:01:09,244
Tactics that are more efficient...

8
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,561
I need a superior strategy!

9
00:01:12,501 --> 00:01:14,787
<i>Even when you're up against the best there is,</i>

10
00:01:15,217 --> 00:01:18,370
<i>you could still imagine how you
can defeat them the next time...</i>

11
00:01:21,718 --> 00:01:23,877
<i>Such foolish, ignorant youth.</i>

12
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:53,471
<i>At least... that's what I thought.</i>

13
00:01:58,642 --> 00:02:03,932
<i>I thought it was all an illusion,
or a bad joke; a vast world of stupid games.</i>

14
00:02:05,987 --> 00:02:10,564
<i>But the truth is, life in this
world didn't have to be so chaotic.</i>

15
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,243
<i>It didn't have to be so random...</i>

16
00:02:14,816 --> 00:02:17,182
<i>Unreasonable and unfair.</i>

17
00:02:17,976 --> 00:02:20,042
<i>It never meant anything at all.</i>

18
00:02:31,096 --> 00:02:31,876
<i>And so...</i>

19
00:02:38,234 --> 00:02:39,260
<i>The next time...</i>

20
00:02:42,142 --> 00:02:44,275
<i>Next time for sure...</i>

21
00:02:59,686 --> 00:03:00,712
Why...?

22
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:03,781
Why can't I win against you?

23
00:03:08,143 --> 00:03:09,905
Not to brag or anything...

24
00:03:09,931 --> 00:03:13,104
But I've only been beaten once
in my entire life, y'know.

25
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:13,649
Hpmh!

26
00:03:14,701 --> 00:03:16,401
Grrrr...

27
00:03:18,922 --> 00:03:21,075
It is the sixth of the Ten Pledges.

28
00:03:21,282 --> 00:03:25,058
"All bets made in accordance
with the pledges must be upheld."

29
00:03:25,145 --> 00:03:29,157
This law is absolute, per the one true
god who created our world of Disboard.

30
00:03:29,623 --> 00:03:30,583
I'll crush you...

31
00:03:30,923 --> 00:03:33,605
Next time, you're totally crushed, thank you very much!

32
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:34,826
"Next time"?

33
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,621
Look... If you couldn't beat those
two, then you won't ever beat ME.

34
00:03:39,808 --> 00:03:43,386
Huh? You know about them? You know about Sora and Shiro?

35
00:03:43,486 --> 00:03:44,528
Sure do.

36
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:48,618
And I've got an interesting story I
can tell you during our next game...

37
00:03:48,653 --> 00:03:50,753
As thanks for this wonderful prize.

38
00:03:51,284 --> 00:03:54,588
You're just trying to distract
me you dirty cheat. Thanks!

39
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:57,612
If you wanna talk, then just start talking! Thanks.

40
00:03:57,692 --> 00:03:59,277
Very well, then I will.

41
00:03:59,391 --> 00:04:03,128
It's an ancient myth you'll
never be able to tell anyone.

42
00:04:03,228 --> 00:04:05,098
S'kay. I'm not listening anyway.

43
00:04:11,824 --> 00:04:17,354
Well... this story goes back more than 6,000 years.

44
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:29,322
A bitter war raged, ravaging the
earth and extinguishing the planets.

45
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:35,018
As time has gone on, no one remembers it anymore...

46
00:04:36,264 --> 00:04:41,581
And yet, this is one tale... I will never forget.

47
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:12,064
It's a big one, huh?

48
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,440
The black ash is really coming down.

49
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:21,273
We should hurry.

50
00:05:37,262 --> 00:05:37,996
Ugh...

51
00:05:38,268 --> 00:05:38,995
Ivan?

52
00:05:39,902 --> 00:05:40,968
I'm okay.

53
00:05:47,343 --> 00:05:49,230
What does the Spirit Compass say?

54
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:51,910
I can't get a reading with all the ash.

55
00:05:52,109 --> 00:05:54,656
We'll be relying on our senses for this recon.

56
00:05:57,098 --> 00:05:58,665
Don't let your guard down.

57
00:05:58,886 --> 00:05:59,636
Riku!

58
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:01,649
Come here, quick! There's a... !

59
00:06:06,274 --> 00:06:07,551
No way...

60
00:06:09,297 --> 00:06:11,366
It's a world map, Dwarvish made.

61
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:14,241
And it looks like the latest version too!

62
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,043
That's not all.

63
00:06:16,852 --> 00:06:21,672
This shows the balance of power between
the races and the dwarves' tactical plan.

64
00:06:22,563 --> 00:06:26,724
Ivan. Alei. Compare this to what
we've got and make any corrections.

65
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,926
I'll make sense of this the best I can.

66
00:06:29,018 --> 00:06:30,286
Ascheito!

67
00:06:43,768 --> 00:06:48,124
Uhh...! A message? From the dwarves?

68
00:06:51,427 --> 00:06:55,675
Huh? "Fusion"... "Detonation"?

69
00:06:57,332 --> 00:07:00,663
Exactly how much of this world do they plan to destroy?

70
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:07,149
Let's get out of here.

71
00:07:07,864 --> 00:07:10,329
Alei. Don't take anything that runs on spiritual energy.

72
00:07:10,383 --> 00:07:11,164
Yeah, but...!

73
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:13,253
If you want to die, go right ahead.

74
00:07:14,614 --> 00:07:15,553
Dammit!

75
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:52,452
Ivan, this is an order.

76
00:07:53,778 --> 00:07:54,806
You will die here.

77
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:56,299
Ascheito.

78
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,738
Ah! Ivan! Wait!

79
00:08:05,107 --> 00:08:06,794
Look after my kid, Riku.

80
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:11,986
Promise you will do that for...

81
00:08:18,303 --> 00:08:19,571
I'm over here!

82
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:22,814
Come and get me, Demonia!

83
00:09:01,522 --> 00:09:04,610
<i>They say there used to be something called "the Sun."</i>

84
00:09:06,058 --> 00:09:08,093
<i>Its white flames lit the heavens,</i>

85
00:09:08,787 --> 00:09:12,243
<i>turning the skies the most
brilliant blue you've ever seen.</i>

86
00:09:12,997 --> 00:09:16,516
<i>And then there's an old story,
like something out of a fairy tale.</i>

87
00:09:17,337 --> 00:09:20,712
<i>The gods and their creations waged eternal war...</i>

88
00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:25,264
<i>The earth burned, choking the heavens with soot</i>

89
00:09:25,746 --> 00:09:28,681
<i>and raining down the ashes of the dead.</i>

90
00:09:32,995 --> 00:09:34,250
Ah! Riku!

91
00:09:37,807 --> 00:09:38,906
These ashes...

92
00:09:40,015 --> 00:09:44,412
It's the least we can do, to honor them... I guess.

93
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:08,698
Non...Na. Heh heh...

94
00:10:09,638 --> 00:10:10,164
Here.

95
00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:12,961
Oooh, is that my name? Y'mean that says, Nonna?

96
00:10:12,986 --> 00:10:14,870
Aww, I wanna see my name, too! Teach me, Couronne!

97
00:10:14,895 --> 00:10:16,405
Wait, I wanna go first, Couronne!

98
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,951
Sure. One at a time.

99
00:10:17,998 --> 00:10:19,300
Aw, come on!

100
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,603
Couronne! They're back!

101
00:10:21,432 --> 00:10:22,465
Ah...

102
00:10:23,912 --> 00:10:24,772
Riku!

103
00:10:27,614 --> 00:10:30,936
Oooh! Oh, you made it!

104
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:32,447
Riku! Thank goodness!

105
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,917
Couronne...

106
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,994
Well... You took your time!

107
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,293
Were you like trying to give
me a heart attack or something?

108
00:10:39,321 --> 00:10:42,858
And come on, seriously, how many times do
I have to tell you to call me "Big Sis"?

109
00:10:42,924 --> 00:10:44,689
We got back as fast as we could.

110
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:45,224
Uh...

111
00:10:47,305 --> 00:10:47,979
Ohh...

112
00:10:49,738 --> 00:10:50,909
About Ivan...

113
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:51,465
Ah! Riku... !

114
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,038
Daddy!

115
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:55,076
Uh, Nonna! Nonna...

116
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:56,538
I'm so glad they're back.

117
00:10:56,563 --> 00:11:00,126
Where's Daddy? I want to show them my
letter, I wrote it myself!

118
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:02,379
Where's my Daddy? Nonna... Listen to me, Nonna...

119
00:11:02,404 --> 00:11:02,958
Uh...

120
00:11:06,257 --> 00:11:07,397
Riku?

121
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,334
Uh...?

122
00:11:13,665 --> 00:11:14,453
Nonna...

123
00:11:16,268 --> 00:11:16,988
Huh...?

124
00:11:19,984 --> 00:11:21,038
Your daddy...

125
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:23,940
your daddy won't be coming home anymore.

126
00:11:28,626 --> 00:11:30,271
How... come?

127
00:11:32,412 --> 00:11:33,555
Because he's dead.

128
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,262
You're lying!

129
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:37,500
It's true Nonna.

130
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:41,181
No, it's not! Daddy promised me he'd come home!

131
00:11:41,488 --> 00:11:42,890
He said we'd win!

132
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,560
He said when it was over the humans would win.

133
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:47,019
We will win.

134
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,498
It's why... it's why your daddy fought so hard...

135
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,860
He did it... so the rest of us could win.

136
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:56,149
That's not "winning" anything! It should've been you!

137
00:11:56,235 --> 00:11:58,570
You! You're the one who should've died!

138
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,017
Nonna! Nonna, please!

139
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:17,360
Why don't you two go clean yourselves up in the bath.

140
00:12:17,665 --> 00:12:19,360
I'll just dust myself off.

141
00:12:19,753 --> 00:12:21,917
No. Take a bath.

142
00:12:22,265 --> 00:12:23,499
You guys stink.

143
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,252
So we... so we could "win" huh?...

144
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,656
I'm a gods... damned hypocrite!

145
00:12:42,331 --> 00:12:45,060
Ah! I made him throw his life away!

146
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,739
I sent him to his death!

147
00:12:48,692 --> 00:12:49,605
I did it!

148
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:51,864
It was me! I killed him!

149
00:12:51,906 --> 00:12:55,301
I sacrificed him just so I could
live a little while longer!

150
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:56,730
Aah!

151
00:12:58,101 --> 00:13:01,514
If this keeps going on, then what's the point?

152
00:13:02,196 --> 00:13:04,153
How far are we willing to go?

153
00:13:04,612 --> 00:13:08,561
Do we kill half the people...
for the sake of saving the other half?

154
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,856
How many is it going to take?

155
00:13:11,251 --> 00:13:13,809
Do we keep going 'til there's only one person left?!

156
00:13:15,255 --> 00:13:18,423
When are we gonna be done with this?

157
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:24,319
How long do we have to keep living like animals?!

158
00:13:31,347 --> 00:13:37,646
<i>No human born into a world like
this could die without a purpose.</i>

159
00:13:39,748 --> 00:13:42,678
<i>It's more that simply having a reason to live:</i>

160
00:13:43,266 --> 00:13:47,694
<i>the mind will not accept death... if it has no meaning.</i>

161
00:13:53,964 --> 00:13:56,447
<i>Ivan's death was not in vain.</i>

162
00:14:00,626 --> 00:14:04,233
<i>The ruins of the elves' old capital city
hold a lot of valuable information...</i>

163
00:14:04,647 --> 00:14:07,284
<i>Things that most people never get a chance to see.</i>

164
00:14:08,637 --> 00:14:12,283
<i>In a place such as this,
does anything make sense anymore?</i>

165
00:14:12,849 --> 00:14:15,731
<i>Is it even possible to find one's sanity?</i>

166
00:14:30,065 --> 00:14:31,125
<i>Dwarves...?</i>

167
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:32,944
<i>No...</i>

168
00:14:34,225 --> 00:14:38,077
<i>With destruction on this scale,
it must have been the Flugel.</i>

169
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:11,994
<i>Look at the size of this thing...</i>

170
00:15:29,821 --> 00:15:32,934
<i>Was that... my imagination?</i>

171
00:15:34,722 --> 00:15:35,842
<i>No!</i>

172
00:15:55,918 --> 00:15:57,558
<i>An Ex Machina!</i>

173
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:58,806
Investigating.

174
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:01,638
Adjusting for current parameters.

175
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:06,793
<i>Stay calm. These things operate as part of a collective.</i>

176
00:16:07,362 --> 00:16:11,492
<i>They have a shared consciousness with their
cluster, which means others must be nearby.</i>

177
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:13,336
<i>And that means...</i>

178
00:16:13,455 --> 00:16:14,309
Conclusion.

179
00:16:14,882 --> 00:16:16,835
<i>If I make any hostile moves,</i>

180
00:16:16,968 --> 00:16:19,768
<i>all the Ex Machina will see me as a threat...</i>

181
00:16:20,337 --> 00:16:23,473
<i>I must. Remain. Still.</i>

182
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,229
I cannot resist you, Big Brother,

183
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:30,102
you must make a woman out of me.

184
00:16:30,127 --> 00:16:30,660
Huh?!

185
00:16:38,273 --> 00:16:39,300
Error.

186
00:16:40,322 --> 00:16:42,478
Cannot... comprehend.

187
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:44,973
I think I'm the one failing to comprehend here!

188
00:16:44,998 --> 00:16:49,403
Conjecture: Is this scenario not
sufficient to bring you gratification?

189
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,664
Yeah, look, I'm real sorry.

190
00:16:51,689 --> 00:16:55,705
But I'm not one of those weirdos who gets
off on being observed by you guys, okay?

191
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,583
Query: Who are "You guys"?

192
00:16:58,609 --> 00:16:59,944
Oh don't play dumb with me.

193
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:02,607
I know all this gets sent to
that Cluster thing of yours.

194
00:17:02,893 --> 00:17:06,940
Negative. This unit has been
disengaged from the Cluster collective.

195
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:08,922
Disengaged you say? Uh...?

196
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,817
So then, you're on your own?

197
00:17:10,926 --> 00:17:11,792
Correct.

198
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:15,092
Well, okay then. Uh...

199
00:17:15,278 --> 00:17:18,906
What does some stray Ex Machina
want with someone like me?

200
00:17:18,966 --> 00:17:22,388
I mean, I'm just a human. If you don't mind me asking.

201
00:17:22,645 --> 00:17:27,126
Response: To analyze the unique
language humans use among themselves.

202
00:17:27,226 --> 00:17:29,916
The language referred to as "the heart."

203
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,142
The heart, huh?

204
00:17:31,264 --> 00:17:35,172
Reasoning: This unit's investigation
into the existence of the heart

205
00:17:35,197 --> 00:17:39,360
generated multiple logic errors,
causing this unit to be disassociated.

206
00:17:39,487 --> 00:17:43,436
Thereafter, further observation
has been conducted independently.

207
00:17:43,461 --> 00:17:47,281
"Observation"? So, your plan is
to study the heart on your own...

208
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:50,139
and get the Cluster to take you back, yes?

209
00:17:50,874 --> 00:17:54,323
Desire. It is postulated that dermal contact,

210
00:17:54,527 --> 00:17:58,510
flesh upon flesh,
results in a unique exchange of emotions.

211
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:01,276
I request you procreate with this unit.

212
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:02,576
I don't think so!

213
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:08,450
Alternative: You may take advantage
of this unit in any manner you wish...

214
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:11,449
though it possesses no orifice.

215
00:18:11,474 --> 00:18:13,966
Look, I said... wait, no orifice?!

216
00:18:18,255 --> 00:18:19,287
Hmm...

217
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:23,867
Losen.

218
00:18:24,846 --> 00:18:25,647
Uhh!

219
00:18:27,424 --> 00:18:29,902
Recreation. Erst...

220
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,360
Chess.

221
00:18:32,138 --> 00:18:33,223
Hm...

222
00:18:34,342 --> 00:18:38,111
A challenge: I request participation. In the game.

223
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:44,056
Conditions: If this unit wins, it shall be
taken home with you and procreation shall occur.

224
00:18:49,408 --> 00:18:52,244
I can only assume you choose chess on purpose.

225
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:55,423
You guys are basically walking calculators,

226
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,511
so there's no way I can win.

227
00:18:58,865 --> 00:18:59,713
Still...

228
00:19:00,986 --> 00:19:01,848
What if...

229
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:05,047
I do manage to win?

230
00:19:05,314 --> 00:19:08,466
Answer: You shall take this unit home...

231
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:10,841
and then immediate procreation shall occur.

232
00:19:10,954 --> 00:19:12,587
That's the same frickin' thing!

233
00:19:13,014 --> 00:19:14,191
Well, whatever.

234
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:17,135
I guess there's no getting out
of it at this point is there?

235
00:19:17,668 --> 00:19:19,094
Fine. I'll play along.

236
00:19:19,168 --> 00:19:22,606
Conclusion: A game in accordance
with the aforementioned terms.

237
00:19:22,673 --> 00:19:24,635
Sure. I'll play you one time.

238
00:19:24,973 --> 00:19:26,466
Except, I'll be making...

239
00:19:27,478 --> 00:19:30,367
a slight change to these little rules of yours.

240
00:19:39,992 --> 00:19:40,834
Uh.. Ah!

241
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,563
Ugh!

242
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,220
We have arrived.

243
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:56,563
Um... so... When it comes to mobility,

244
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,747
you really don't use any spiritual energy?

245
00:19:58,989 --> 00:19:59,796
Correct.

246
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,150
Utilizing spiritual energy would have saved

247
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:05,068
fifty... five thousand,
seven hundred and eighty-two seconds.

248
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:05,552
Ugh...

249
00:20:06,252 --> 00:20:08,618
Addendum: This unit is a "Prufer,"

250
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,655
a model primarily used for analysis.

251
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,890
Its capabilities are lesser than other Ex Machina.

252
00:20:12,915 --> 00:20:15,757
With a half... assed "race" like this waging war,

253
00:20:16,154 --> 00:20:18,329
it's no wonder the world's gone to hell.

254
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:21,332
What should I call you?

255
00:20:21,656 --> 00:20:22,825
Meaning unknown.

256
00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:24,778
Your name. Don't you have one?

257
00:20:25,138 --> 00:20:26,301
Understood.

258
00:20:26,401 --> 00:20:29,539
Designation number: Uber Cluster Zwei Null Sieben

259
00:20:29,587 --> 00:20:31,673
Peh Err Vier Funf Sieben Teh Neun.

260
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,276
You kidding, that's your name?

261
00:20:33,376 --> 00:20:35,211
Forget that. You're going to
need to go with something easier.

262
00:20:35,628 --> 00:20:37,778
Query: If this unit wins,

263
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:41,938
it will stay with Riku until it is able
to fully comprehend the human heart.

264
00:20:42,377 --> 00:20:44,816
Should this unit conceal that it is a machine?

265
00:20:44,841 --> 00:20:49,206
The heart's like an unspoken feeling that
is formed through mutual understanding.

266
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,281
And if you're gonna be with me,
then you're going to need to dress like a human.

267
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:55,333
Query: Is self... designation an option?

268
00:20:55,358 --> 00:20:56,542
Sure, whatever.

269
00:20:59,265 --> 00:21:02,078
Response: I shall be Schwarzer.

270
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:05,077
Nope, that's hard to say and weird.
Not gonna work for me.

271
00:21:05,311 --> 00:21:06,559
Let's just go with "Schwi."

272
00:21:06,619 --> 00:21:09,218
Unclear. Adjustment was made for self... configuration.

273
00:21:09,243 --> 00:21:11,911
Can we do something about the way
you talk before we get started?

274
00:21:12,497 --> 00:21:15,734
Laden. Adopting Personality Eins Sechs Ein Null.

275
00:21:17,565 --> 00:21:20,560
Tee... hee... hee! Is this better for you, Big Brother?

276
00:21:20,591 --> 00:21:21,877
Ugh. Never mind!

277
00:21:21,912 --> 00:21:24,825
Retort: Setting was the most logical choice available.

278
00:21:25,198 --> 00:21:29,426
And what "logical" nonsense did you use
to position yourself as my younger sister?

279
00:21:29,717 --> 00:21:33,009
Answer: I merely presented what
was the most optimal option.

280
00:21:33,103 --> 00:21:34,200
Yeah, well...

281
00:21:34,609 --> 00:21:37,810
It'd be a big problem if people
were to start asking about our past.

282
00:21:38,223 --> 00:21:40,986
Just act shy, and don't say more than you have to.

283
00:21:41,313 --> 00:21:44,057
And quit starting every sentence
sounding like a robot...

284
00:21:44,284 --> 00:21:45,231
Understood?

285
00:21:48,042 --> 00:21:49,389
Understood.

286
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:53,343
Something like this?

287
00:21:53,703 --> 00:21:56,507
Uh... Are you... acting or something?

288
00:21:56,618 --> 00:21:59,091
"Acting"? I'm not.

289
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:03,276
I have chosen a personality
matching the given parameters.

290
00:22:03,403 --> 00:22:05,300
It's a trace emulation.

291
00:22:05,546 --> 00:22:06,955
Hm... it'll do...

292
00:22:08,135 --> 00:22:09,755
I want you to stay where I can see you.

293
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,287
And keep those clothes on.

294
00:22:12,189 --> 00:22:15,594
Is there maybe something you can do about that tail...
looking thing you got there?

295
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:16,866
Negative.

296
00:22:17,186 --> 00:22:18,963
It is Schwi's power source,

297
00:22:18,996 --> 00:22:21,660
a nerve corer of quasi... spiritual circuitry...

298
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:24,507
Ah... Alright, fine I guess.

299
00:22:24,532 --> 00:22:26,180
We'll just say it's a fashion choice.

300
00:22:26,205 --> 00:22:27,861
But, I'm going to say this one more time:

301
00:22:27,886 --> 00:22:31,481
Do NOT show that robot body
of yours to anyone else. Okay?

302
00:22:31,714 --> 00:22:34,600
Yes. I will show it only to you.

303
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,228
Awww! She's so cute! Who is she?!

304
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:42,026
Found her on the way back,
at a colony that'd been wiped out. She was in a...

305
00:22:42,126 --> 00:22:44,829
Oh! So is she... your wife?!

306
00:22:44,972 --> 00:22:45,830
His "Wife"?

307
00:22:45,855 --> 00:22:46,252
Uh...!

308
00:22:46,292 --> 00:22:47,678
Oh c'mon, don't be shy.

309
00:22:47,703 --> 00:22:49,533
Now your first priority should be having kids,

310
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,511
and then next is food,

311
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,403
and then of course having five or six more kids!

312
00:22:52,428 --> 00:22:53,538
Would you please cut that out.

313
00:22:53,566 --> 00:22:54,772
And you that goes for you too!

314
00:22:55,027 --> 00:22:56,395
What does she mean?

315
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,049
She doesn't mean anything!

316
00:22:58,444 --> 00:22:59,451
What's your name?

317
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,044
I'm Schwi.

318
00:23:01,473 --> 00:23:03,290
That's a lovely name.

319
00:23:03,461 --> 00:23:05,780
So, how did you meet Riku here anyway?

320
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:07,835
Well he...

321
00:23:08,627 --> 00:23:10,028
He kissed Schwi.

322
00:23:10,148 --> 00:23:13,304
And demanded that the two of us partake in procreation.

323
00:23:15,543 --> 00:23:18,899
Uh... Uh no, I just...!

324
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:19,949
Riku...

325
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:22,442
You couldn't wait could you, huh...

326
00:23:23,457 --> 00:23:26,038
Don't you have a shred of decency?!

327
00:23:27,321 --> 00:23:30,108
You could've worded that differently, you know.

328
00:23:30,965 --> 00:23:31,999
"Differently"?

329
00:23:32,113 --> 00:23:33,383
Never mind.

330
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,553
Look, could you at least try to look a bit more mature?

331
00:23:37,746 --> 00:23:39,894
You're making me look bad over here.

332
00:23:40,856 --> 00:23:44,046
Okay. But isn't this the form that you prefer.

333
00:23:44,071 --> 00:23:45,528
Nah, that ain't my thing.

334
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:48,636
Then... what form DO you like?

335
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:50,515
Now you listen here...

336
00:23:50,608 --> 00:23:53,197
Do you even know what it means
when you ask that question?

337
00:23:55,397 --> 00:23:57,549
I'm wanting to know what you prefer.

338
00:23:57,876 --> 00:24:00,868
That's not something I can really tell you with words.

339
00:24:01,268 --> 00:24:03,392
You remember how I explained the human heart?

340
00:24:03,745 --> 00:24:05,480
I remember.

341
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,553
So then. Let's play.

342
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:09,998
No thanks.

343
00:24:10,445 --> 00:24:12,724
I didn't have much choice before, but...

344
00:24:12,824 --> 00:24:15,983
I find games pointless,
and I don't have the time to waste on them.

345
00:24:16,594 --> 00:24:19,306
What if... they are not pointless?

346
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:24,303
What if you win, the prize will
be all the information you desire.

347
00:24:24,723 --> 00:24:26,057
For example...

348
00:24:26,379 --> 00:24:28,886
the reason that the Great War began.

349
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,935
And what it will take to end it.

350
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:35,325
Uh! Gimme a break.

351
00:24:35,448 --> 00:24:38,041
We humans don't have any choice in that nonsense,

352
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,881
so there's no point in bothering with it.

353
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:43,144
There's only one thing I need to know how to do.

354
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:47,601
How to make it through the day alive.

355
00:24:48,215 --> 00:24:49,190
And that's it.

356
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:54,211
That's the whole reason I brought you along.

357
00:24:55,511 --> 00:24:59,879
The knowledge, the math,
the engineering tech you Ex Machina contain...

358
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:03,360
If I can beat you, then THAT'S what I want.

359
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,556
Hm... Understood.

360
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:11,862
Given the current state of our world,

361
00:25:12,297 --> 00:25:14,879
the fact that humans have survived is...

362
00:25:15,491 --> 00:25:16,993
an anomaly.

363
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,283
Even we Ex Machina cannot calculate a reason for this.

364
00:25:23,433 --> 00:25:27,594
As lifeforms, you are weak.
Your civilization is primitive.

365
00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:30,603
You cannot utilize spiritual power. And yet...

366
00:25:31,428 --> 00:25:32,978
You have subsisted.

367
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:35,653
It defies all reason.

368
00:25:36,082 --> 00:25:39,950
Yet there must be an answer... a key to your survival.

369
00:25:40,084 --> 00:25:44,228
And my theory is... that it resides in the human heart.

370
00:25:44,588 --> 00:25:46,607
And I intend to find it.

371
00:25:46,857 --> 00:25:48,062
I wish to discover...

372
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:48,789
Enough...

373
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,919
Hmm...?

374
00:25:50,802 --> 00:25:53,005
You're so full of shit.

375
00:25:53,217 --> 00:25:53,789
Riku?

376
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:55,373
You do whatever you want.

377
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:57,253
You wage war whenever want.

378
00:25:57,286 --> 00:25:59,204
You've taken everything from us,

379
00:25:59,284 --> 00:26:02,488
and well I'm so sorry if you're
puzzled why we're still alive.

380
00:26:02,711 --> 00:26:05,957
No wonder you know nothing about the human heart.

381
00:26:07,518 --> 00:26:09,493
Okay fine, you wann know!

382
00:26:09,518 --> 00:26:11,251
What I feel in my heart hasn't changed

383
00:26:11,276 --> 00:26:13,444
one damn bit since the moment I was born!

384
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,770
You can burn in hell, every last one of you!

385
00:26:18,921 --> 00:26:21,791
Do you know how many people have
died because of you bastards?

386
00:26:21,816 --> 00:26:24,045
You probably know exactly how many! Don't you?!

387
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:27,672
And how many more will you make US kill?

388
00:26:29,014 --> 00:26:31,466
Riku... I have made you cry.

389
00:26:32,574 --> 00:26:33,675
So therefore...

390
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:37,270
I assume... I have said something terrible.

391
00:26:37,713 --> 00:26:39,553
Something to hurt you.

392
00:26:42,485 --> 00:26:44,679
What I do know about the heart...

393
00:26:45,007 --> 00:26:46,991
is that deep inside it...

394
00:26:47,237 --> 00:26:49,119
you wish to kill me.

395
00:26:50,532 --> 00:26:55,036
Riku. You can stab me. I will die.

396
00:26:55,229 --> 00:26:58,602
Rather... Since I am not a living being,

397
00:26:58,635 --> 00:27:00,934
it will be a permanent cessation,

398
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:03,196
with repair not being possible...

399
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,239
A complete systemic failure.

400
00:27:06,957 --> 00:27:09,049
I wish to know your heart.

401
00:27:09,446 --> 00:27:10,647
That is all.

402
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:13,409
If this is truly what your heart desires...

403
00:27:13,644 --> 00:27:15,923
then I want it to be realized.

404
00:27:16,154 --> 00:27:18,316
I want you to kill me.

405
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,770
Chad, Anton, Elma, Corey, Dale,

406
00:27:25,795 --> 00:27:30,376
Silith, Ed, Darrel, Dave, Larcus,

407
00:27:30,502 --> 00:27:32,839
Vin, Eric, Charlie...

408
00:27:32,864 --> 00:27:33,619
Riku?

409
00:27:33,644 --> 00:27:36,383
Thompson, Shinta, Yang, Zsa Zsa,

410
00:27:36,543 --> 00:27:40,413
Zargo, Cray, Goro, Peter, Arthur,

411
00:27:40,513 --> 00:27:45,553
Morg, Kimmy, Dat, Cyril, Vizzie, Wally,

412
00:27:45,711 --> 00:27:49,872
Ken, Savage, Leroy, Bobo, Couthon, Lito,

413
00:27:49,897 --> 00:27:53,509
Shigure, Shao, Wolf, Bard, Asso, Kenwood,

414
00:27:53,534 --> 00:27:56,719
Peil, Ahad, Hound, Barloff, Masashi,

415
00:27:56,873 --> 00:28:00,427
Memegan, Karim... Ivan!

416
00:28:01,903 --> 00:28:04,384
Forty... eight people... Forty... eight!

417
00:28:04,504 --> 00:28:07,076
And I am the one who ordered them all to die!

418
00:28:07,565 --> 00:28:10,237
Too many people have died during your Great War...

419
00:28:10,262 --> 00:28:13,483
removed from this world like dust being swept away.

420
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:16,300
And the one who sent those people to die...

421
00:28:17,306 --> 00:28:19,159
The one who told them to...

422
00:28:35,952 --> 00:28:37,112
Riku?

423
00:28:47,085 --> 00:28:48,001
Oh...

424
00:28:55,907 --> 00:28:57,660
Riku? You awake?

425
00:28:57,714 --> 00:29:01,860
Sorry, I know you're tired,
but if you don't mind.. I'd uh...

426
00:29:03,768 --> 00:29:05,401
AHH! Sorry!

427
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:06,434
Uh...

428
00:29:10,108 --> 00:29:13,826
Um, okay Schwi, do you mind if I ask you
why you're sitting there straddling me?

429
00:29:14,327 --> 00:29:17,546
Riku... You instructed me to
stay where you could see me.

430
00:29:17,613 --> 00:29:19,754
I only meant for you to stay nearby.

431
00:29:20,174 --> 00:29:23,482
Question: If I'm not in your line
of sight then can you see me?

432
00:29:23,507 --> 00:29:24,728
Oh, is this some sort of roleplay?

433
00:29:24,753 --> 00:29:25,899
Close the damn door!

434
00:29:25,924 --> 00:29:28,085
Oh, it's okay sweetie, I understand...

435
00:29:28,219 --> 00:29:31,817
Whenever you're done,
let me know and Schwi can take a bath.

436
00:29:31,966 --> 00:29:33,453
Uh... don't mind her.

437
00:29:34,426 --> 00:29:35,106
Mph...

438
00:29:37,284 --> 00:29:38,103
I see.

439
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:42,701
Riku said I can show my body only to him.
In that case...

440
00:29:42,805 --> 00:29:44,807
Whaah! You have her trained?!

441
00:29:44,907 --> 00:29:46,875
Couronne, would you please just leave us alone?!

442
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,781
Oh wow, things sure are moving quickly.

443
00:29:48,826 --> 00:29:50,852
Okay, I'll let you two have some privacy.

444
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:53,371
And I'll go kick out whoever's in the bath.

445
00:30:09,332 --> 00:30:11,252
I am... sorry.

446
00:30:11,856 --> 00:30:12,992
Sorry for what?

447
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:16,894
For being the aggressor and yet asking about the heart.

448
00:30:17,351 --> 00:30:18,731
It's illogical.

449
00:30:19,468 --> 00:30:23,186
I wouldn't say "illogical" ...  it's insensitive.

450
00:30:23,485 --> 00:30:26,584
My circuits... are capable of sensitive transmission.

451
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:28,446
Um, that's not what I meant.

452
00:30:30,127 --> 00:30:33,453
In any case... I'm sorry that I got way all worked up.

453
00:30:34,268 --> 00:30:36,103
Is that a bad thing to do?

454
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:39,308
Could be. I might lose it and smack you,

455
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:41,453
and that wouldn't solve anything would it?

456
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:43,378
Do you wish to strike me, Riku?

457
00:30:43,403 --> 00:30:45,891
Of course not, I'm just making a point.

458
00:30:47,227 --> 00:30:48,896
I, uh... I don't know...

459
00:30:49,688 --> 00:30:51,610
Maybe I'm not so sure myself.

460
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:55,746
Riku. Let's play a game.

461
00:30:55,891 --> 00:30:56,584
Huh?

462
00:31:01,724 --> 00:31:03,724
What did you bring that thing for?

463
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:07,749
Because... that's when you smiled, Riku.

464
00:31:07,856 --> 00:31:09,324
It's the only time.

465
00:31:09,497 --> 00:31:10,103
Uh...?

466
00:31:10,651 --> 00:31:11,417
So...

467
00:31:14,401 --> 00:31:16,120
Let's... play a game.

468
00:31:16,587 --> 00:31:17,267
Huh?

469
00:31:18,456 --> 00:31:21,564
I wish... I wish to know your heart, Riku.

470
00:31:22,063 --> 00:31:25,602
But also... not in a manner that hurts you.

471
00:31:25,889 --> 00:31:27,437
I have a conflict.

472
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,559
I don't know what to do.

473
00:31:31,427 --> 00:31:33,882
You mean you'd have to hurt me in order to do it?

474
00:31:34,035 --> 00:31:36,170
Can't you just go back to your Cluster?

475
00:31:36,356 --> 00:31:38,540
I'm sure you can learn all you want about the heart

476
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:40,135
without forcing it out of me.

477
00:31:40,235 --> 00:31:42,033
Yes. That's true.

478
00:31:42,621 --> 00:31:46,129
But either way, I do not wish to cause you harm...

479
00:31:48,444 --> 00:31:49,874
Why is that?

480
00:31:49,899 --> 00:31:51,572
Wha...? You're asking ME?

481
00:31:52,676 --> 00:31:54,037
Stating possibility.

482
00:31:54,062 --> 00:31:57,167
Answer: The unit has found the Cluster pointless,

483
00:31:57,192 --> 00:31:58,722
and meaningless, and irrelevant,

484
00:31:58,747 --> 00:32:01,742
with personal analysis of the heart taking prominence.

485
00:32:01,935 --> 00:32:03,319
I want you to remain.

486
00:32:03,344 --> 00:32:06,312
Error. Error. Error. Error.
Uh! Agh! What's going on?

487
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,306
Ah! Hey cut that out!

488
00:32:12,303 --> 00:32:16,735
Conclusion: It seems I don't want... to go back.

489
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:17,924
It seems?

490
00:32:18,223 --> 00:32:20,425
Unable to quantify definitely.

491
00:32:20,551 --> 00:32:21,471
Although...

492
00:32:22,371 --> 00:32:23,880
It would seem so.

493
00:32:24,751 --> 00:32:26,088
So it does... Heheh...

494
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:29,836
but it's a little confusing.

495
00:32:31,078 --> 00:32:32,580
Pawn to E... 4.

496
00:32:32,757 --> 00:32:35,000
Hey, you could at least let me have the first move.

497
00:32:35,025 --> 00:32:36,198
The next turn is yours.

498
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:39,001
Also, you're playing while I'm
sitting here brushing your hair.

499
00:32:39,026 --> 00:32:40,601
That's not very fair, is it?

500
00:32:40,807 --> 00:32:43,450
So, why's it so long anyway?

501
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:46,553
If you would prefer it to be short, I will cut it.

502
00:32:46,606 --> 00:32:48,070
Hehe. No, you don't have to do that.

503
00:32:48,095 --> 00:32:50,647
Heheh. You just don't get it, do you?

504
00:33:08,246 --> 00:33:09,166
Oh...

505
00:33:13,096 --> 00:33:13,963
Hmm....

506
00:33:27,677 --> 00:33:28,411
Riku.

507
00:33:28,436 --> 00:33:30,583
Hm? Uhh?

508
00:33:30,703 --> 00:33:34,281
Here you go. I have designed a compact telescope.

509
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:37,216
Look I told you. I still haven't beaten you at chess.

510
00:33:37,241 --> 00:33:39,286
But I... thought this was what you wanted.

511
00:33:39,311 --> 00:33:40,729
So I made it for you.

512
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:43,090
Um... Huh...

513
00:33:45,121 --> 00:33:46,970
That is where I met you.

514
00:33:46,995 --> 00:33:48,369
Uh, yeah.

515
00:33:49,214 --> 00:33:52,027
There's something about that place
that's always really bugged me...

516
00:33:52,314 --> 00:33:55,993
but it's so far away that I can't
just get up and walk there can I?

517
00:33:58,219 --> 00:33:59,353
Ugh!

518
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:01,011
We've arrived.

519
00:34:03,879 --> 00:34:07,465
Well you sure are the observant one arent'cha? Hooray.

520
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:12,161
Have you noticed? The buildings are all destroyed,

521
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:15,729
but for some reason,
the ground here is mostly untouched.

522
00:34:16,341 --> 00:34:19,541
That would be because of the elves' protective magic.

523
00:34:19,741 --> 00:34:24,242
But why let everything get completely
wiped out except for this one spot?

524
00:34:24,382 --> 00:34:27,724
To the elves, this was an important facility,

525
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:32,500
an emergency shelter, or perhaps something else.

526
00:34:32,824 --> 00:34:34,895
Something of more value.

527
00:34:38,311 --> 00:34:43,184
A facility to research and develop new weaponry.

528
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,374
What the hell is this?

529
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,734
Protective glyphs of the Old Deus Kainas.

530
00:34:56,145 --> 00:34:58,956
Kainas... That's the creator of the elves.

531
00:34:59,665 --> 00:35:02,186
Huh... These are not protective glyphs.

532
00:35:02,211 --> 00:35:04,701
And they do not correspond to any available data

533
00:35:04,726 --> 00:35:07,304
regarding elvish glyphs or magical rites.

534
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:10,634
It's probably some damn new
horrible foolishness they invented.

535
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:13,955
They're as hell...
bent as the dwarves to destroy the planet.

536
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:19,716
"Aka Si Anse... proof of concept reactor..."

537
00:35:20,511 --> 00:35:23,450
Riku... you can read the Elvish language?

538
00:35:24,683 --> 00:35:28,429
The best clues and information out there
is worthless if you can't understand it.

539
00:35:28,786 --> 00:35:33,058
To this day, the traits, and the languages,
and the customs of the various races

540
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:37,030
have been passed down in oral history, written works...
any means you can think of.

541
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:40,894
It's what we do ...  because we lowly humans

542
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:43,575
aren't going to just sit back
and let ourselves get wiped out.

543
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:44,281
Oh...

544
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,263
That being said...

545
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:49,176
I can't read a damn thing else on here.

546
00:35:49,494 --> 00:35:52,937
Especially this part. It must be like a name, right?

547
00:35:52,962 --> 00:35:55,710
If this is all classified information,

548
00:35:55,735 --> 00:35:59,479
then it is most likely that it is in code. Encrypted.

549
00:35:59,504 --> 00:36:01,621
Yeah, you're right and that's a problem.

550
00:36:02,002 --> 00:36:06,420
It means even the names of whoever's
involved with this have also been encrypted.

551
00:36:06,934 --> 00:36:09,270
"Aka Si Anse..."

552
00:36:09,771 --> 00:36:13,653
The only thing we know for sure so far,
is a bunch of friggin' nonsense, huh?

553
00:36:17,983 --> 00:36:19,018
Riku, stand back!

554
00:36:19,355 --> 00:36:20,358
Losen.

555
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,093
Einweg!

556
00:36:28,755 --> 00:36:29,801
Run!

557
00:36:35,929 --> 00:36:37,484
Dammit!

558
00:36:37,798 --> 00:36:38,490
Uhh!

559
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:40,363
Schwi!

560
00:36:40,388 --> 00:36:43,023
Oh...! Ah...

561
00:36:44,564 --> 00:36:46,371
Ah...!

562
00:36:46,811 --> 00:36:47,577
Schwi!

563
00:36:48,743 --> 00:36:50,011
Ri...

564
00:36:51,545 --> 00:36:53,015
Ugh!

565
00:37:09,265 --> 00:37:09,956
Eh...

566
00:37:11,086 --> 00:37:12,082
Schwi...

567
00:37:13,016 --> 00:37:14,227
Schwi!

568
00:37:17,967 --> 00:37:20,156
Uh... Schwi...

569
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:24,455
Their security system...

570
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:27,498
The elvish magic... remains active.

571
00:37:27,523 --> 00:37:28,436
Huh?

572
00:37:28,543 --> 00:37:30,888
Don't worry. It will be fine.

573
00:37:31,064 --> 00:37:32,652
Losen.

574
00:37:32,677 --> 00:37:34,028
Steh Apokryphen.

575
00:37:42,023 --> 00:37:44,011
Ah... What was that?

576
00:37:44,036 --> 00:37:46,339
A special ability of the Ex Machina.

577
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:49,775
If attacked, we can analyze,
emulate, and reproduce the attack,

578
00:37:50,005 --> 00:37:51,144
copying it.

579
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,830
But as a Prufer, I would only be able to generate

580
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,383
less than 10% of its original strength.

581
00:37:58,884 --> 00:38:00,344
Yeah, if you say so...

582
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:03,238
But you might still tone it down a bit.

583
00:38:06,247 --> 00:38:07,613
I'm sorry.

584
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:08,406
Huh?

585
00:38:09,363 --> 00:38:12,776
I broke my promise. And I used spiritual energy.

586
00:38:13,269 --> 00:38:16,351
Yeah well. I guess it's better than dying.

587
00:38:16,754 --> 00:38:19,256
Anyway we should probably get out of here pretty quick

588
00:38:19,281 --> 00:38:21,684
before some band of freaks comes and finds us.

589
00:38:26,255 --> 00:38:29,327
Dammit! We've got a soot storm.

590
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:30,687
I will be fine.

591
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:33,203
My system pumps a decontamination solution

592
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,196
that purges the impurities of the ash.

593
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,496
You may be fine, but that doesn't mean I would be.

594
00:38:45,535 --> 00:38:48,447
So, I see... you brought the chess set, right?

595
00:38:48,472 --> 00:38:49,815
Yes, I'm sorry.

596
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:52,511
No, it's not that I'm criticizing you.

597
00:38:52,917 --> 00:38:54,204
You wanna play a game?

598
00:38:54,891 --> 00:38:55,858
You don't mind?

599
00:38:55,979 --> 00:38:57,274
No, this is good.

600
00:38:57,615 --> 00:39:00,396
We're stuck down here because
of the storm and everything.

601
00:39:00,831 --> 00:39:02,790
It's a good way to kill some time, right?

602
00:39:04,121 --> 00:39:04,893
Hmm!

603
00:39:10,958 --> 00:39:12,965
Come on! How do you keep doing that?!!

604
00:39:13,065 --> 00:39:13,989
One more time!

605
00:39:14,335 --> 00:39:16,368
Riku... Why do you keep challenging me

606
00:39:16,468 --> 00:39:18,206
when you know that you cannot beat me?

607
00:39:18,306 --> 00:39:19,492
"I can't beat you"?

608
00:39:20,152 --> 00:39:23,460
Yes, well. You haven't yet. Not even once.

609
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,546
Look, I'm just thinking about this in the big picture.

610
00:39:26,628 --> 00:39:27,914
The law of averages.

611
00:39:28,014 --> 00:39:30,656
There's no way you can beat me every single time.

612
00:39:30,984 --> 00:39:31,695
Oh...

613
00:39:34,255 --> 00:39:37,833
I... I understand. Partially.

614
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:38,547
Huh?

615
00:39:39,275 --> 00:39:43,329
The current conditions upon this
planet are fatal for all humanity.

616
00:39:43,508 --> 00:39:46,175
The fact that you exist is... an aberration.

617
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,134
Hmm...

618
00:39:48,164 --> 00:39:49,657
This aberration...

619
00:39:50,205 --> 00:39:53,211
Correction: This accomplishment is possible...

620
00:39:53,942 --> 00:39:57,344
Because of your heart... your will.

621
00:39:58,618 --> 00:40:02,733
Despite overwhelming odds,
humanity as a whole survives...

622
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,081
this is an objective fact... and yet...

623
00:40:05,294 --> 00:40:07,785
you refuse to accept that fact.

624
00:40:08,813 --> 00:40:12,575
For some reason, you do not wish
to acknowledge what you are.

625
00:40:12,696 --> 00:40:14,927
Why is that?

626
00:40:17,001 --> 00:40:18,828
Well, let me ask you this:

627
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:22,576
What's the point of surviving when
you live in a world like this one?

628
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:27,745
You just run as hard and as fast as you
can, and you keep running... but what then?

629
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:29,580
What the hell else do you do?

630
00:40:29,605 --> 00:40:33,426
Just sit back and let yourself
get obliterated into nothing?!

631
00:40:33,604 --> 00:40:35,258
And if you don't like that idea,

632
00:40:35,283 --> 00:40:39,159
can you let 999 people die for the sake of 1,001?

633
00:40:39,184 --> 00:40:41,059
Will that change anything at all?! Huh?!

634
00:40:41,627 --> 00:40:42,554
Riku...

635
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,072
Tell me this, Schwi: What else can we do?

636
00:40:51,976 --> 00:40:53,802
What should I do?

637
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,354
I wish to know as well.

638
00:41:01,129 --> 00:41:05,519
So then... What does your heart tell you, Riku?

639
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:10,639
Heh... Just look at what a freakin' mess I am, huh?

640
00:41:11,033 --> 00:41:13,736
I asked you, 'cause honestly, I don't know.

641
00:41:14,256 --> 00:41:16,205
I'm afraid my heart's not talking.

642
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:19,961
In that case... What do you wish to do?

643
00:41:19,986 --> 00:41:21,214
Um... uh...?

644
00:41:22,237 --> 00:41:23,753
"What I wish to do"?

645
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:26,890
Whatever it is... I will help you.

646
00:41:27,557 --> 00:41:29,645
I will be right by your side...

647
00:41:31,013 --> 00:41:32,482
And I will stay there...

648
00:41:32,877 --> 00:41:34,919
Until I understand your heart.

649
00:41:35,851 --> 00:41:37,725
I shall keep watch over you...

650
00:41:37,991 --> 00:41:41,324
to see what it is that your heart truly desires.

651
00:41:41,824 --> 00:41:44,928
I wish to do whatever it is YOU wish to do Riku.

652
00:41:45,049 --> 00:41:46,222
Uhhh!

653
00:41:56,518 --> 00:41:57,786
Checkmate.

654
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:06,890
Schwi... That would've probably been a pretty good
time to maybe call it a draw? I'm just sayin'.

655
00:42:06,915 --> 00:42:10,217
Has there been any changes in atmospheric conditions?

656
00:42:10,242 --> 00:42:12,491
Uh...? No...

657
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:17,337
No... Hehe... No, there hasn't.

658
00:42:22,176 --> 00:42:23,489
Ohh...

659
00:42:24,632 --> 00:42:25,633
Ohh...

660
00:42:25,824 --> 00:42:27,496
It's beautiful.

661
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:28,436
Huh?

662
00:42:31,813 --> 00:42:36,169
Schwi... it's kinda nice... not being alone, huh?

663
00:42:36,286 --> 00:42:40,209
Huh? Riku, you haven't always been alone, have you?

664
00:42:40,304 --> 00:42:41,841
Nah. But like an idiot,

665
00:42:41,941 --> 00:42:43,977
I've always pushed myself to extremes,

666
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:46,058
trying to be something... special.

667
00:42:47,224 --> 00:42:48,959
But anyway...

668
00:42:49,116 --> 00:42:51,800
If I were to just go by what I want to do, well then...

669
00:42:51,925 --> 00:42:53,654
things might actually work out pretty well.

670
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:54,866
Oh...

671
00:42:57,933 --> 00:42:58,647
Schwi...

672
00:43:00,316 --> 00:43:03,098
Tell me something. What's the point of this war?

673
00:43:03,386 --> 00:43:05,052
And what can we do to end it?

674
00:43:08,701 --> 00:43:13,450
<i>When I was a child, I thought the
world was a much, much simpler place.</i>

675
00:43:14,616 --> 00:43:16,811
<i>I thought there was no challenge that was unbeatable...</i>

676
00:43:16,911 --> 00:43:20,516
<i>that if I tried hard enough, anything was possible.</i>

677
00:43:22,594 --> 00:43:24,327
<i>Everything was cut and dry:</i>

678
00:43:25,211 --> 00:43:28,159
<i>You win, you lose, or it ends in a draw.</i>

679
00:43:29,829 --> 00:43:32,677
<i>I thought I was seeing the world with clear eyes.</i>

680
00:43:34,297 --> 00:43:34,950
<i>But it...</i>

681
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:39,060
<i>But it was all such foolish, ignorant youth.</i>

682
00:43:40,681 --> 00:43:41,688
<i>And you know...</i>

683
00:43:43,072 --> 00:43:44,079
<i>in the end...</i>

684
00:43:44,776 --> 00:43:46,878
It turns out I was dead wrong.

685
00:43:47,033 --> 00:43:47,813
Huh?

686
00:43:48,379 --> 00:43:49,722
You know what, Schwi...

687
00:43:49,916 --> 00:43:53,511
together, I think we can make things
in this world get interesting.

688
00:43:54,286 --> 00:43:56,707
Yes. That's it there.

689
00:43:56,732 --> 00:43:58,973
Those eyes are good, Riku.

690
00:43:58,998 --> 00:44:00,729
I have... good eyes?

691
00:44:01,402 --> 00:44:02,222
No.

692
00:44:03,457 --> 00:44:07,484
Schwi... likes to see those eyes.

693
00:44:08,118 --> 00:44:10,711
I mean. Don't you?

694
00:44:10,835 --> 00:44:11,639
Uh?

695
00:44:13,005 --> 00:44:15,326
Ah... Hehehe...

696
00:44:15,446 --> 00:44:18,090
There you go, bein' confusing again.

697
00:44:18,115 --> 00:44:19,454
Huh?

698
00:44:46,832 --> 00:44:48,586
This is really bad!

699
00:44:50,247 --> 00:44:52,822
Please remain calm! Head for the west exit!

700
00:44:53,029 --> 00:44:54,417
Nonna, you go with the others.

701
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:54,957
Mm... hm!

702
00:44:54,982 --> 00:44:56,604
Okay, now go!

703
00:44:58,725 --> 00:44:59,325
Ah!

704
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:03,126
Riku! Oh!

705
00:45:06,902 --> 00:45:08,242
R... Riku...

706
00:45:09,671 --> 00:45:10,559
Dammit!

707
00:45:10,912 --> 00:45:13,298
This place will get turned to ash too?

708
00:45:14,649 --> 00:45:15,709
Then what...?

709
00:45:16,277 --> 00:45:19,210
Tell me, huh? What have I done all this for?!

710
00:45:20,118 --> 00:45:23,573
Riku. C'mon, you can't worry about that now.

711
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:27,334
Why don't you just let me take things from here, okay?

712
00:45:29,288 --> 00:45:31,857
Schwi. You put that in writing, right?

713
00:45:32,717 --> 00:45:33,804
Yes, I did.

714
00:45:33,917 --> 00:45:34,827
Huh?

715
00:45:35,256 --> 00:45:36,893
Which means, Couronne,

716
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:38,921
that as of today, you're head of the colony.

717
00:45:38,946 --> 00:45:41,885
And that... is the site for your new colony.

718
00:45:42,091 --> 00:45:44,458
You'll be safe if you stay on the western escape route.

719
00:45:44,578 --> 00:45:46,339
Well, best of luck to you and everything.

720
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:48,929
Hey! Riku, wait a second Riku!

721
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:51,013
Without you, me and the rest of the camp are doomed!

722
00:45:51,038 --> 00:45:52,816
Nah, everything's gonna be fine.

723
00:45:53,975 --> 00:45:55,515
Because from here on out...

724
00:45:55,683 --> 00:45:57,472
no one else is gonna die.

725
00:45:57,543 --> 00:45:58,820
Huh?

726
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:00,820
Riku!

727
00:46:04,726 --> 00:46:05,476
Uhh...

728
00:46:07,648 --> 00:46:08,391
Hm...

729
00:46:10,026 --> 00:46:14,504
Hey guys! So what sort of craziness
are you two cooking up, huh?

730
00:46:14,918 --> 00:46:18,195
Oh you know. Just a little game.

731
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,107
We're gonna take it easy just pass the time.

732
00:46:22,396 --> 00:46:24,969
As of now, everyone here is dead.

733
00:46:25,342 --> 00:46:27,551
We did not make it out of the colony in time.

734
00:46:28,259 --> 00:46:30,494
We no longer exist in this world...

735
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:32,682
We're Ghosts.

736
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,599
The day of the final battle WILL come.

737
00:46:36,732 --> 00:46:39,460
It's no use in hoping for a future where it won't.

738
00:46:40,555 --> 00:46:42,400
The world is an abomination.

739
00:46:42,621 --> 00:46:46,046
So do we just run to stay alive,
praying for that last battle?

740
00:46:46,071 --> 00:46:47,091
And if so, pray to who?

741
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:50,434
These goddamn butchers who call themselves gods?!

742
00:46:51,109 --> 00:46:53,098
Artosh, creator of the Fluegel!

743
00:46:53,851 --> 00:46:55,993
Kainas, creator of the elves!

744
00:46:56,527 --> 00:46:59,007
Okein, creator of the dwarves!

745
00:46:59,694 --> 00:47:02,643
All of them claim to be the
one true ruler of this world,

746
00:47:02,676 --> 00:47:04,483
fighting for their precious throne

747
00:47:04,523 --> 00:47:07,543
and doing nothing but destroying
everything in the process!

748
00:47:07,956 --> 00:47:11,365
These pieces of shit don't deserve any of our prayers!

749
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:14,796
It's time to open your eyes.

750
00:47:14,863 --> 00:47:17,611
We can no longer rely on hope to save us.

751
00:47:19,208 --> 00:47:22,794
Which is why... we have to build things up ourselves.

752
00:47:24,114 --> 00:47:26,742
In the end, this world is nothing but a game.

753
00:47:27,862 --> 00:47:30,103
Those butchers are after the Suniaster...

754
00:47:30,957 --> 00:47:35,248
a conceptual device said to grant
absolute authority over this entire world.

755
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,228
Which is why they have devoted themselves
to this game where anything goes.

756
00:47:39,713 --> 00:47:40,700
And so...

757
00:47:41,013 --> 00:47:43,708
We're gonna make our own rules, on our own terms.

758
00:47:43,733 --> 00:47:44,679
And then...

759
00:47:45,246 --> 00:47:46,460
We will win.

760
00:47:48,096 --> 00:47:50,741
Number One: No matter what, you must not kill!

761
00:47:51,188 --> 00:47:53,094
<i>The heart does not wish for murder....</i>

762
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:56,413
Number Two: You must let no one die!

763
00:47:56,831 --> 00:47:58,740
<i>The heart doesn't want anyone to die...</i>

764
00:47:59,133 --> 00:48:01,694
Number Three: You must let no one discover you!

765
00:48:01,761 --> 00:48:03,509
<i>If we're discovered, we're dead.</i>

766
00:48:03,616 --> 00:48:06,844
Number Four: No tactic is off limits!

767
00:48:07,344 --> 00:48:10,028
<i>Not even the slyest trick will be considered "dirty."</i>

768
00:48:10,563 --> 00:48:14,168
Number Five: Those guys' rules mean nothing to us!

769
00:48:14,388 --> 00:48:17,381
<i>The heart doesn't give two shits
about their bloody contest.</i>

770
00:48:17,634 --> 00:48:20,931
Number Six: Break any of these rules and you lose.

771
00:48:21,277 --> 00:48:25,318
<i>The heart will gain nothing from a
victory that violates our principles.</i>

772
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:30,199
That's it. Now we do whatever we want.

773
00:48:31,326 --> 00:48:33,023
We are the Ghosts.

774
00:48:33,196 --> 00:48:35,713
We will not kill a single member of the other races,

775
00:48:35,766 --> 00:48:37,385
including the Old Deus.

776
00:48:37,671 --> 00:48:40,522
And we will not be discovered! We are a phantom.

777
00:48:40,547 --> 00:48:43,641
And we will guide the course
of this war to its fruition!

778
00:48:44,398 --> 00:48:45,699
That will be our victory!

779
00:48:45,799 --> 00:48:49,031
To finally see the end of their goddamn war!

780
00:48:49,144 --> 00:48:52,914
Our enemies are gods,
with great tools of violence and despair.

781
00:48:53,121 --> 00:48:56,111
Now, this game was never meant for us to play.

782
00:48:56,510 --> 00:49:00,296
So winning means we must do everything
in secret and behind the scenes.

783
00:49:00,321 --> 00:49:02,969
And even if we win, we can have no memory of it.

784
00:49:03,118 --> 00:49:04,871
Because Ghosts don't exist.

785
00:49:04,977 --> 00:49:09,511
They just vanish ...  into the void, into nothingness.

786
00:49:09,977 --> 00:49:11,017
But know this...

787
00:49:11,394 --> 00:49:12,711
If we can do this.

788
00:49:13,031 --> 00:49:16,629
If we can master this game for
real, and if we can win it...

789
00:49:17,716 --> 00:49:20,785
We can... we can die with our heads high...

790
00:49:21,248 --> 00:49:24,132
cause we lived the coolest, most bad... ass lives ever!

791
00:49:24,887 --> 00:49:25,544
Oh...

792
00:49:26,877 --> 00:49:29,232
Okay, if you're willing to play along.

793
00:49:29,512 --> 00:49:31,727
And you're ready to get started. Then stay here.

794
00:49:38,865 --> 00:49:41,222
Uhm... I'm gonna be honest with you.

795
00:49:41,908 --> 00:49:45,370
No offense, but I really thought that
you guys were a bit smarter than this.

796
00:49:45,436 --> 00:49:48,496
A smart man would've left before
you finished your little speech.

797
00:49:48,521 --> 00:49:52,407
Come on now, you didn't really think there were
any "smart" people left in the world, did ya?

798
00:49:52,432 --> 00:49:55,871
And where else are you ever gonna find
a bunch of crazier fools than these?

799
00:49:56,224 --> 00:49:59,003
The smart have already choosen death over this place.

800
00:49:59,043 --> 00:50:02,013
And yet the smartest ones, didn't bother being born!

801
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,960
You get what you ask for Riku.

802
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,999
You're the one who chose us remember?

803
00:50:06,053 --> 00:50:07,139
Yeah, that's right!

804
00:50:07,164 --> 00:50:08,711
The one who leads a bunch of dumbasses

805
00:50:08,745 --> 00:50:10,498
is the biggest dumbass of all!

806
00:50:12,998 --> 00:50:15,132
<i>Yes. Humans are foolish.</i>

807
00:50:15,536 --> 00:50:19,617
<i>But it's takes a great fool,
to know how to not let foolishness get them killed.</i>

808
00:50:20,201 --> 00:50:23,004
<i>We have stayed alive in a world where life has no value.</i>

809
00:50:23,652 --> 00:50:27,048
<i>Everyone has bet it all,
through science and knowledge and intellect,</i>

810
00:50:27,115 --> 00:50:28,095
<i>and made that happen...</i>

811
00:50:28,401 --> 00:50:31,445
<i>They're all fools. Incredibly weak and vulnerable.</i>

812
00:50:31,725 --> 00:50:35,592
<i>Magnificent, weak fools, all worthy of great respect.</i>

813
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:37,650
Okay, everybody let's do this!

814
00:50:37,675 --> 00:50:40,294
Let us pledge upon the wishes
of all our fallen brethren.

815
00:50:40,349 --> 00:50:42,066
Ascheito!

816
00:50:42,992 --> 00:50:48,476
No. Not upon the memories of the fallen:
But the rules we have vowed to follow.

817
00:50:49,265 --> 00:50:50,375
To everyone here...

818
00:50:51,935 --> 00:50:53,594
I pledge Aschento!

819
00:50:56,566 --> 00:51:00,381
<i>Okay... Let's get this game started.</i>

820
00:51:06,506 --> 00:51:09,121
Riku... I am now certain.

821
00:51:09,821 --> 00:51:12,157
I do not understand the human heart.

822
00:51:12,414 --> 00:51:13,001
Hm?

823
00:51:13,162 --> 00:51:17,341
All potential strategies have a
less than 1% chance of success.

824
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,957
And you must be wondering why everyone's
so sure that we can pull it off?

825
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:21,890
Mm... hm.

826
00:51:22,127 --> 00:51:23,270
So uh, Schwi...

827
00:51:23,536 --> 00:51:26,517
If you roll a die,
what are the odds it will come up a six?

828
00:51:26,611 --> 00:51:28,150
A one in six chance.

829
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:29,294
Yeah, maybe so...

830
00:51:29,768 --> 00:51:31,846
But what if someone who doesn't exist,

831
00:51:31,871 --> 00:51:34,231
swaps it out for a die that will roll ONLY a six?

832
00:51:34,264 --> 00:51:38,338
Uh... You're talking about
manipulation of the variables.

833
00:51:38,363 --> 00:51:40,458
Yeah. I like to call it "cheating."

834
00:51:41,153 --> 00:51:42,293
Sounds fun, right?

835
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:45,123
We are the singularity of the equation.

836
00:51:45,663 --> 00:51:48,769
We'll make every prediction,
every strategy and calculation,

837
00:51:48,809 --> 00:51:51,261
come together exactly how we want it to.

838
00:51:51,655 --> 00:51:53,622
If we pull it off, it'll be a...

839
00:51:53,691 --> 00:51:54,451
A miracle.

840
00:51:54,476 --> 00:51:55,135
Uh?

841
00:51:55,476 --> 00:51:56,911
It would be an anomaly.

842
00:51:57,088 --> 00:52:00,087
Success would be a distortion of probability theory.

843
00:52:00,447 --> 00:52:02,620
I know... Anything can happen though.

844
00:52:03,184 --> 00:52:05,551
Zero or 100, it doesn't really matter...

845
00:52:05,797 --> 00:52:08,274
I mean, that's why they call it a theory right?

846
00:52:08,501 --> 00:52:10,347
Would you like me to prove it to you?

847
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,810
Question: What are the odds that, right here and now,

848
00:52:13,835 --> 00:52:15,536
I were to profess my love to you?

849
00:52:16,987 --> 00:52:20,635
Intent unclear. Estimation: Near zero.

850
00:52:20,668 --> 00:52:22,941
Yeah well... You're wrong.

851
00:52:28,539 --> 00:52:30,872
Will you marry me, Schwi?

852
00:52:36,985 --> 00:52:41,673
Cannot... comprehend. I decline.

853
00:52:41,874 --> 00:52:44,507
I'M SORRY! I KNOW! THAT WAS TOO MUCH TOO SOON!

854
00:52:44,532 --> 00:52:46,453
I MEAN I'VE NEVER EVEN BEEN WITH A GIRL BEFORE!

855
00:52:46,478 --> 00:52:47,627
Marriage...

856
00:52:49,292 --> 00:52:52,802
A vow of intimacy humans exchange in order to reproduce.

857
00:52:52,996 --> 00:52:54,838
But Schwi is an Ex Machina.

858
00:52:54,925 --> 00:52:56,379
I don't care about that!

859
00:52:56,939 --> 00:52:59,016
I just want you with me forever.

860
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:01,432
I just want you to always be by my side!

861
00:53:01,966 --> 00:53:03,197
I already am.

862
00:53:03,244 --> 00:53:05,070
That's not what I mean okay!

863
00:53:05,095 --> 00:53:07,410
I'm talking, like, as a life partner!

864
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:10,179
Ex Machina cannot reproduce.

865
00:53:10,246 --> 00:53:11,670
I know, I don't care!

866
00:53:11,717 --> 00:53:13,234
We cannot copulate either.

867
00:53:13,361 --> 00:53:15,523
Riku, you would always be a virgin.

868
00:53:16,758 --> 00:53:18,168
I don't care about that!

869
00:53:18,215 --> 00:53:19,203
You hesitated.

870
00:53:19,228 --> 00:53:21,729
Oh, quit nitpicking the semantics!

871
00:53:23,037 --> 00:53:24,769
It is not possible.

872
00:53:26,178 --> 00:53:27,284
Because...

873
00:53:27,744 --> 00:53:28,529
Schwi?

874
00:53:29,363 --> 00:53:32,107
Because... Because I...

875
00:53:34,017 --> 00:53:36,572
<i>Transmission: From Prufer to Einzig.</i>

876
00:53:36,737 --> 00:53:37,865
<i>Decision reached.</i>

877
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:41,064
I destroyed your home, Riku. It was me.

878
00:53:41,386 --> 00:53:45,755
<i>Losen. Origin Zwei Acht Null Sieben. Einweg.</i>

879
00:53:58,733 --> 00:53:59,893
I did it.

880
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:12,253
Can you... still say what you just said?

881
00:54:13,735 --> 00:54:14,954
Schwi.

882
00:54:15,334 --> 00:54:16,889
I already knew that.

883
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,758
Somehow, I already knew.

884
00:54:18,858 --> 00:54:19,717
Oh!

885
00:54:21,115 --> 00:54:23,235
But... how's that?

886
00:54:23,674 --> 00:54:26,902
Well... the first thing that seemed a little off was...

887
00:54:27,129 --> 00:54:29,868
You know... the first moment we ever met.

888
00:54:30,128 --> 00:54:34,125
I mean, why would you have chosen to
play chess in the first place? Right?

889
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:34,778
Oh!

890
00:54:35,543 --> 00:54:37,663
And then, why else would you just so happen

891
00:54:37,688 --> 00:54:39,652
to be sitting there outside of the settlement?

892
00:54:39,825 --> 00:54:43,211
Heh... Wasn't very well thought out, was it?

893
00:54:43,751 --> 00:54:44,831
Even if that's so... Why...?

894
00:54:45,325 --> 00:54:49,898
Well... I guess, because once I knew the whole story...

895
00:54:49,998 --> 00:54:52,466
I kinda fell for you. What can I say?

896
00:54:52,525 --> 00:54:53,020
Uhh!

897
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:56,816
Nothing will change the fact
that you wiped out my hometown.

898
00:54:57,569 --> 00:55:01,245
But if not for that, well then...
we probably never would have met.

899
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:02,061
Oh...

900
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:03,820
It is what it is.

901
00:55:03,845 --> 00:55:07,887
We can try and sugarcoat it,
but it won't change anything.

902
00:55:08,174 --> 00:55:10,513
You can cry or feel bad.

903
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:12,826
Or promise to never do it again.

904
00:55:13,583 --> 00:55:17,176
Maybe pity's why you took an
interest in me in the first place.

905
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:19,434
Hehe...

906
00:55:19,834 --> 00:55:23,550
But no matter your past...
in the present you're with me.

907
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,063
And in my future is where I want you to stay...

908
00:55:26,465 --> 00:55:27,784
It's called forever.

909
00:55:29,301 --> 00:55:31,400
Being with you has made me think that,

910
00:55:31,732 --> 00:55:34,927
even in a world like this, I want to live.

911
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,977
It's the only thing I can think
of that makes we want to smile.

912
00:55:39,356 --> 00:55:40,138
So...

913
00:55:40,613 --> 00:55:42,571
Will you throw logic out the window

914
00:55:43,459 --> 00:55:45,654
and choose to walk this path with me?

915
00:55:46,757 --> 00:55:49,861
That is... as my wife.

916
00:55:54,166 --> 00:55:55,983
Uh! Schwi!

917
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:00,300
In every sense...

918
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:04,815
To all rational appearances... it is absurd.

919
00:56:04,995 --> 00:56:06,488
And yet...

920
00:56:08,763 --> 00:56:11,958
Let me... let me be by your side.

921
00:56:12,185 --> 00:56:15,799
With you and you alone Riku. Forever.

922
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:20,502
And I the same with you.

923
00:56:25,262 --> 00:56:28,386
Riku: Do you take Schwi as your wife,

924
00:56:28,479 --> 00:56:30,019
swearing to grow together,

925
00:56:30,099 --> 00:56:31,940
support and love each other,

926
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:33,349
and to stay alive?

927
00:56:33,375 --> 00:56:34,488
Yeah, yeah, I swear.

928
00:56:34,513 --> 00:56:37,079
Riku, please! You're supposed to say "Ascheito"!

929
00:56:37,105 --> 00:56:39,380
Sorry. We sort of got rid of that.

930
00:56:39,405 --> 00:56:40,851
Now, it's "Aschiento."

931
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:44,059
It kinda bugs me that you've been
up to all this crazy stuff...

932
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:46,134
without letting me know anything.

933
00:56:46,266 --> 00:56:47,260
Like, what the heck?

934
00:56:47,285 --> 00:56:49,817
You all of the sudden tell me you have a secret hideout,

935
00:56:49,842 --> 00:56:51,632
and when I get here, you're getting married!

936
00:56:51,657 --> 00:56:53,091
I mean, what is that?!

937
00:56:53,116 --> 00:56:55,415
Can we just get on with the stupid ceremony, please?

938
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,542
You're the one who said we needed it.

939
00:56:57,942 --> 00:57:00,533
Do you, Schwi, take Riku as your husband,

940
00:57:00,558 --> 00:57:03,388
swearing to grow together,
support and love each other... ?

941
00:57:03,413 --> 00:57:03,777
I swear.

942
00:57:03,802 --> 00:57:04,228
Uh?

943
00:57:04,479 --> 00:57:05,870
I swear to Riku,

944
00:57:06,061 --> 00:57:09,000
the one who taught me why I was born,

945
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:12,089
and gave me a heart... I pledge myself.

946
00:57:12,555 --> 00:57:14,491
I will not let you die, Riku.

947
00:57:14,523 --> 00:57:17,282
We will live side by side, right to the end.

948
00:57:17,383 --> 00:57:18,353
Aschiento.

949
00:57:18,789 --> 00:57:20,066
Eheheh!

950
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:23,365
And so, as your new "Big Sister..."

951
00:57:23,652 --> 00:57:25,702
I would like to congratulate you on your marriage.

952
00:57:25,727 --> 00:57:26,347
Uh! Wait, Couronne!

953
00:57:26,372 --> 00:57:27,213
Ahh...?

954
00:57:33,786 --> 00:57:34,580
Uhh...

955
00:57:34,661 --> 00:57:36,179
Ooo... You are so cute!

956
00:57:36,204 --> 00:57:37,832
Couronne, why are you...?

957
00:57:37,919 --> 00:57:41,260
Well she is the one you chose as your bride, right Riku?

958
00:57:41,285 --> 00:57:42,209
Uh!

959
00:57:42,742 --> 00:57:44,112
So, in closing,

960
00:57:44,255 --> 00:57:46,047
you shall carve your names on this.

961
00:57:46,469 --> 00:57:47,749
On a rock?

962
00:57:47,927 --> 00:57:49,049
Yes, on a rock.

963
00:57:49,256 --> 00:57:50,727
If you guys are gonna live in secret,

964
00:57:50,752 --> 00:57:52,403
there can be no official documents.

965
00:57:52,661 --> 00:57:53,820
That's your name...

966
00:57:54,254 --> 00:57:55,796
Yes, my surname.

967
00:57:56,189 --> 00:57:59,325
And from now on,
it will be the same for all three of us.

968
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:00,006
Uh...

969
00:58:02,634 --> 00:58:04,913
Feels weird for us to share a name.

970
00:58:06,335 --> 00:58:08,537
Riku, Schwi...

971
00:58:09,221 --> 00:58:10,774
I don't know what you are...

972
00:58:11,008 --> 00:58:13,324
what either of you are planning to do.

973
00:58:13,924 --> 00:58:17,030
I mean, you two aren't really part of this world.

974
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:18,998
But well...

975
00:58:19,225 --> 00:58:21,712
I do know I have a little brother I adore

976
00:58:21,737 --> 00:58:24,456
and now a gorgeous younger sister, too.

977
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:25,323
So...

978
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:29,835
I beg you... be careful and don't do anything rash.

979
00:58:30,322 --> 00:58:32,232
I don't want to lose my family!

980
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:35,831
Yeah. No one is gonna die, Couronne.

981
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:39,077
Because this is one game... we're sure to win.

982
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:41,909
You can trust us... Okay, Big Sister.

983
00:58:54,589 --> 00:58:57,329
I can smell it... the black ash!

984
00:58:57,416 --> 00:58:59,088
Well done, warbeast.

985
00:58:59,344 --> 00:59:01,274
You can eat me if you want, but...

986
00:59:01,774 --> 00:59:04,551
I guarantee you, I won't taste very good.

987
00:59:05,164 --> 00:59:07,301
Who the hell are you?!

988
00:59:07,417 --> 00:59:10,831
Your clan has made the west coast of
the continent of Lucia your home...

989
00:59:11,378 --> 00:59:15,086
but the dwarves are planning to conduct
an advanced weapons test out there.

990
00:59:15,421 --> 00:59:16,383
And be warned,

991
00:59:16,456 --> 00:59:18,445
this thing could even kill an Old Deus.

992
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:20,938
It's a large... scale explosive
device called an E... bomb.

993
00:59:22,603 --> 00:59:25,077
Your kind can use Blood Destruction, yes?

994
00:59:25,446 --> 00:59:28,362
It could prove useful for you to
get into the dwarves' facility.

995
00:59:28,686 --> 00:59:32,312
You could make quick work of it,
take care of things however you like.

996
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:37,028
The dwarves' fleet keeps close watch on the warbeasts

997
00:59:37,053 --> 00:59:38,641
and then moves into action.

998
00:59:38,919 --> 00:59:42,829
The warbeasts, fearful of the E... bomb, flee Lucia.

999
00:59:43,402 --> 00:59:47,571
Next, secret elvish information
is leaked to the dwarves.

1000
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,343
And THIS...

1001
00:59:50,165 --> 00:59:51,861
is where it all comes together.

1002
00:59:56,472 --> 00:59:57,910
Who are you?

1003
00:59:58,505 --> 01:00:02,404
Let's see... I'll just call myself a Ghost.

1004
01:00:02,744 --> 01:00:08,025
I assume you have business here that
warrants barging into my home unannounced.

1005
01:00:08,174 --> 01:00:11,089
I was thinking the two of us could have a little game.

1006
01:00:11,682 --> 01:00:12,597
A game?

1007
01:00:12,686 --> 01:00:15,548
And the currency we'll bet with is information.

1008
01:00:15,573 --> 01:00:17,501
If you win, I'll tell you something.

1009
01:00:17,567 --> 01:00:19,718
If you lose, you tell me something.

1010
01:00:19,743 --> 01:00:22,308
I don't know who you are or where you're from...

1011
01:00:22,375 --> 01:00:26,489
and yet you think Nina Clive would
just accept a challenge from you?

1012
01:00:26,514 --> 01:00:28,446
I'll give you something up front then:

1013
01:00:28,593 --> 01:00:31,852
Information on the Aka Si Anse
has been leaked to the dwarves.

1014
01:00:31,877 --> 01:00:32,305
Uh?

1015
01:00:32,763 --> 01:00:34,100
Is that good enough?

1016
01:00:34,841 --> 01:00:38,145
As the Advocate and Caretaker of Aka Si Anse Theory,

1017
01:00:38,292 --> 01:00:41,791
you should have the ability to confirm
if this information is valid or not.

1018
01:00:42,355 --> 01:00:43,493
Am I mistaken?

1019
01:00:45,812 --> 01:00:47,019
Hm, very well.

1020
01:00:47,714 --> 01:00:49,056
I may not know who you are,

1021
01:00:49,081 --> 01:00:51,571
but this is something I cannot ignore.

1022
01:00:51,906 --> 01:00:53,374
Therefore, here is my wager:

1023
01:00:53,659 --> 01:00:55,777
the Advocate of Aka Si Anse Theory is in fact...

1024
01:00:55,802 --> 01:00:57,207
It's somebody else, right?

1025
01:00:57,232 --> 01:00:57,726
Uh...!

1026
01:00:57,751 --> 01:00:59,639
Yes, I've already heard.

1027
01:01:00,027 --> 01:01:00,566
Hm...

1028
01:01:00,591 --> 01:01:03,136
But I also know that's not true.

1029
01:01:03,419 --> 01:01:03,905
Mmh?

1030
01:01:04,346 --> 01:01:07,810
And that you will resort to magic
to make me believe your lie.

1031
01:01:12,209 --> 01:01:14,615
Now then... what shall I give you?

1032
01:01:15,725 --> 01:01:19,289
Ah... when the dwarves learned of the Aka Si Anse,

1033
01:01:19,454 --> 01:01:21,862
they concluded that it wasn't a threat.

1034
01:01:22,144 --> 01:01:23,604
And I have proof.

1035
01:01:24,046 --> 01:01:25,778
But that's ridiculous.

1036
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:27,504
It's true.

1037
01:01:29,091 --> 01:01:30,932
And I have more information...

1038
01:01:31,208 --> 01:01:33,744
the dwarves are in possession of a weapon of their own.

1039
01:01:33,884 --> 01:01:36,851
And it's even more powerful than the Aka Si Anse.

1040
01:01:42,667 --> 01:01:44,020
The E... bomb...

1041
01:01:44,796 --> 01:01:47,872
Yes. A weapon of tremendous scale.

1042
01:01:47,897 --> 01:01:50,220
One that could wipe out the entire continent.

1043
01:01:50,245 --> 01:01:54,288
You're saying those creatures who burrow in
the earth like moles, have created something...

1044
01:01:54,313 --> 01:01:56,410
something more advanced than the Aka Si Anse,

1045
01:01:56,535 --> 01:01:59,048
the culmination of elvish spiritual magic?

1046
01:01:59,499 --> 01:02:00,967
Wait just a moment.

1047
01:02:01,947 --> 01:02:05,062
There have been times that
you've chosen to lose on purpose.

1048
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:07,718
Let me ask one last thing:

1049
01:02:08,221 --> 01:02:11,919
Are you our enemy? Or are you our ally?

1050
01:02:12,231 --> 01:02:14,698
I am neither your enemy nor your ally.

1051
01:02:14,922 --> 01:02:16,618
I have but one concern...

1052
01:02:18,099 --> 01:02:21,429
you only suffer as few casualties as possible.

1053
01:02:23,431 --> 01:02:25,513
Very well, Mr. Ghost.

1054
01:02:26,307 --> 01:02:28,443
To be clear, young man, I can assume

1055
01:02:28,617 --> 01:02:31,198
you have shared this information with me alone, yes?

1056
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,768
Oh, and Mr. Ghost...

1057
01:02:38,793 --> 01:02:42,323
I guess I should tell you my name is not Nina Clive...

1058
01:02:42,367 --> 01:02:45,562
Tee... hee! Rather my name is Think Nilvalen.

1059
01:02:45,802 --> 01:02:48,865
Did I fool you or did you already figure it out?

1060
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:51,249
Huh, you tell me.

1061
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:53,824
Did you ever once hear me call you "Nina"?

1062
01:02:57,912 --> 01:03:00,031
Of course if you know anything about me,

1063
01:03:00,056 --> 01:03:01,444
I am going to make you regret

1064
01:03:01,469 --> 01:03:03,990
ever trying to make me your plaything.

1065
01:03:04,477 --> 01:03:08,491
After all, the rumor that elves
are relentlessly tenacious...

1066
01:03:08,704 --> 01:03:11,966
first began with none other than the Nilvalen family.

1067
01:03:14,008 --> 01:03:15,055
Riku!

1068
01:03:15,889 --> 01:03:17,162
Riku, here!

1069
01:03:17,592 --> 01:03:19,245
It's a decontaminant!

1070
01:03:20,952 --> 01:03:22,884
Riku, you lied to me!

1071
01:03:22,909 --> 01:03:24,737
You said it would only be an hour!

1072
01:03:24,764 --> 01:03:27,410
You've been breathing black ash for twice that time!

1073
01:03:34,885 --> 01:03:36,538
I didn't have a choice.

1074
01:03:37,158 --> 01:03:40,477
I had to, or I would've given myself away.

1075
01:03:40,564 --> 01:03:41,917
I had to do it.

1076
01:03:43,257 --> 01:03:46,337
And besides... I don't care how smart you are...

1077
01:03:46,604 --> 01:03:49,901
no one could predict this sort
of suicidal behavior, right?

1078
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:54,035
Riku!

1079
01:03:57,538 --> 01:03:59,405
Looks like this may be it for me, huh?

1080
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:00,658
Mmph...

1081
01:04:00,855 --> 01:04:04,409
So... How much longer do you think I've got?

1082
01:04:05,676 --> 01:04:08,573
Riku, I won't let you die.

1083
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,652
You have to stay alive until I die.

1084
01:04:12,367 --> 01:04:15,578
Oh yeah, and how long do Ex Machina live?

1085
01:04:15,778 --> 01:04:19,294
I have another 892 years in my service life.

1086
01:04:20,026 --> 01:04:20,426
Huh?

1087
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:24,564
Guess I'll have to step up my game, won't I?

1088
01:04:27,317 --> 01:04:29,569
<i>And so, the first objective was achieved...</i>

1089
01:04:29,931 --> 01:04:33,874
<i>moving the violent battle lines
outside of the human territories.</i>

1090
01:04:36,114 --> 01:04:38,783
Look at this. First the dwarves, and now the elves.

1091
01:04:38,953 --> 01:04:41,268
Even the warbeasts are leaving in droves.

1092
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:43,210
What's going on?

1093
01:04:44,168 --> 01:04:45,748
Uh... Lily!

1094
01:04:45,773 --> 01:04:47,695
Keep an eye on things for me! I'll be back!

1095
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,239
Oh...? Huh? Hey! Couronne!

1096
01:04:52,031 --> 01:04:55,534
<i>The Ghosts continued to take
action from behind the scenes.</i>

1097
01:04:55,834 --> 01:05:00,024
<i>And just like we wanted, the elves
eventually became allies with the fairies</i>

1098
01:05:00,084 --> 01:05:03,035
<i>and moved to ramp up their contracts with the dragonia</i>

1099
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:05,094
<i>in order to fend off the dwarvish fleet.</i>

1100
01:05:05,377 --> 01:05:08,544
<i>Meanwhile, the dwarves became allies with the gigants,</i>

1101
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:12,366
<i>as well as several phantasma,
who were all on friendly terms.</i>

1102
01:05:12,532 --> 01:05:14,722
<i>Manipulated by the Ghosts' information,</i>

1103
01:05:14,822 --> 01:05:17,558
<i>each of the major powers took steps to guard against</i>

1104
01:05:17,595 --> 01:05:20,328
<i>the large... scale destructive weaponry of the other,</i>

1105
01:05:20,428 --> 01:05:23,833
<i>moving their headquarters to the
neighboring continent of Ariela.</i>

1106
01:05:24,433 --> 01:05:26,726
<i>And well, that just so happened to be the home base</i>

1107
01:05:26,751 --> 01:05:29,358
<i>for what was currently the greatest threat of all:</i>

1108
01:05:29,538 --> 01:05:34,216
<i>The lord of the Fluegel, the Old Deus... Artosh.</i>

1109
01:05:37,014 --> 01:05:38,002
Einweg.

1110
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:43,232
Twenty... three units are now installed.

1111
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:45,849
That leaves... nine remaining.

1112
01:05:46,786 --> 01:05:51,447
<i>And so, as each of the other races sought
to take advantage of this situation,</i>

1113
01:05:51,554 --> 01:05:55,053
<i>the clock began ticking down
to the world's final battle...</i>

1114
01:05:55,988 --> 01:05:58,599
Exactly like we wanted.

1115
01:06:01,349 --> 01:06:05,312
Hey, Schwi... of all the gods, is there a god of games?

1116
01:06:05,576 --> 01:06:06,412
Huh?

1117
01:06:06,965 --> 01:06:07,754
And if, uh...

1118
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,814
if I told you I'd met him, would you believe me?

1119
01:06:12,585 --> 01:06:16,049
The stuff he does,
it's way beyond anything I can anticipate,

1120
01:06:16,215 --> 01:06:18,990
so of course I lose to him every single time.

1121
01:06:19,736 --> 01:06:20,466
And yet...

1122
01:06:20,854 --> 01:06:23,291
It's so much fun that I can't stand it.

1123
01:06:23,442 --> 01:06:27,230
And it's like... I just know that
I can beat him the next time.

1124
01:06:27,533 --> 01:06:30,418
I've been thinking about that
since this whole thing started..

1125
01:06:30,443 --> 01:06:31,753
And I have to do it...

1126
01:06:31,778 --> 01:06:34,443
I have to settle things with him once and for all...

1127
01:06:35,142 --> 01:06:38,727
because that game of ours isn't over yet.

1128
01:06:40,019 --> 01:06:44,883
If you believe this, well then, I believe it too.

1129
01:06:45,139 --> 01:06:45,777
Uh...!

1130
01:06:46,271 --> 01:06:48,988
If you say he exists, then he does.

1131
01:06:49,494 --> 01:06:51,663
I do not doubt you.

1132
01:06:52,464 --> 01:06:56,157
Oh, come on! Are you kidding me!

1133
01:06:56,182 --> 01:06:58,380
Why isn't someone here to hear you say that!

1134
01:06:58,405 --> 01:07:00,267
They'll never believe me!

1135
01:07:00,367 --> 01:07:02,027
Oh! Oh, Riku!

1136
01:07:03,993 --> 01:07:04,830
Riku!

1137
01:07:05,428 --> 01:07:06,250
Oh?

1138
01:07:06,944 --> 01:07:08,066
Couronne!

1139
01:07:11,406 --> 01:07:15,311
It's just like you said: we haven't
lost a single person to the war.

1140
01:07:15,967 --> 01:07:18,923
And sightings of the other races have dried up too.

1141
01:07:18,948 --> 01:07:19,764
Yeah, I bet.

1142
01:07:20,678 --> 01:07:23,278
Well, if you two are the ones behind all of this,

1143
01:07:23,447 --> 01:07:26,099
then I'd say that you were
doing something pretty amazing.

1144
01:07:26,303 --> 01:07:27,536
But dammit, Riku!

1145
01:07:27,598 --> 01:07:30,389
Look at the shape you're in?
You need to be more careful.

1146
01:07:30,586 --> 01:07:31,419
It's not a problem.

1147
01:07:31,444 --> 01:07:33,225
It's a BIG problem, Riku!

1148
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:34,652
You're falling apart!

1149
01:07:35,572 --> 01:07:37,281
We're almost there, okay?

1150
01:07:38,053 --> 01:07:40,624
Just leave me be.

1151
01:07:41,326 --> 01:07:44,509
But when is "almost"? I want it to be over?

1152
01:07:44,803 --> 01:07:47,664
How long do I have to keep worrying about you?

1153
01:07:53,239 --> 01:07:54,594
Listen to me, Couronne...

1154
01:07:55,548 --> 01:07:58,887
Do you know what the gods are
after with this war of theirs?

1155
01:07:58,912 --> 01:07:59,732
Uh...?

1156
01:07:59,984 --> 01:08:01,742
The throne of the One True God.

1157
01:08:01,795 --> 01:08:04,079
Yup. According to Schwi,

1158
01:08:04,311 --> 01:08:07,185
it's something they refer to as the Suniaster.

1159
01:08:07,794 --> 01:08:09,957
It's a kind of conceptual device.

1160
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:14,212
And it was designed so that out of all those
big, fancy Old Deus idiots,

1161
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:16,407
only one of them can be called "God."

1162
01:08:16,473 --> 01:08:18,039
"Conceptual device"?

1163
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:20,725
How are you ever suppose to find something like that?

1164
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,887
It will appear only under one condition:

1165
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:28,529
it must manifest itself in front of the
absolute greatest power on the planet.

1166
01:08:28,554 --> 01:08:31,371
And if there are ten gods out there of equal power...

1167
01:08:31,431 --> 01:08:33,821
they will eventually kill all the other nine

1168
01:08:33,846 --> 01:08:36,534
making whoever's left their One True God.

1169
01:08:36,578 --> 01:08:38,711
That's their twisted way of thinking.

1170
01:08:38,811 --> 01:08:40,764
What?! Then they're morons!

1171
01:08:41,277 --> 01:08:43,814
So that's the reason we've been...?

1172
01:08:43,873 --> 01:08:46,880
Couronne, they're even dumber than you think.

1173
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:48,859
Listen to this...

1174
01:08:49,248 --> 01:08:51,141
Their precious Suniaster,

1175
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:54,158
we can make it show up without
going through all that trouble.

1176
01:08:54,258 --> 01:08:55,160
Huh?

1177
01:08:55,266 --> 01:08:58,363
And that's why I've gathered all
these handsome fellows together.

1178
01:08:59,343 --> 01:09:00,718
The Aka Si Anse,

1179
01:09:01,465 --> 01:09:02,519
the E... bomb,

1180
01:09:02,854 --> 01:09:04,166
the Heaven's Strike...

1181
01:09:04,419 --> 01:09:06,132
They're powerful enough on their own,

1182
01:09:06,305 --> 01:09:08,179
but when put together in one area...

1183
01:09:08,659 --> 01:09:10,292
They could blast a hole...

1184
01:09:10,422 --> 01:09:11,994
right through the planet.

1185
01:09:12,041 --> 01:09:13,254
Huh? The planet?!

1186
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:16,553
All the Old Deus were originally born from this world...

1187
01:09:16,713 --> 01:09:18,906
they all came from the Spirit Circuit.

1188
01:09:19,501 --> 01:09:22,662
Which means the greatest power in
the whole wide world is actually...?

1189
01:09:22,695 --> 01:09:24,668
Ump! The Spirit Circuit!

1190
01:09:24,868 --> 01:09:25,985
We may be the weakest,

1191
01:09:26,032 --> 01:09:28,649
but we've set the stage for the final scene.

1192
01:09:28,896 --> 01:09:31,165
We're gonna to use their own strength against them

1193
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:34,956
and turn the global balance of
power on its baffled little head.

1194
01:09:35,261 --> 01:09:38,706
The Suniaster will appear, and once it is acquired,

1195
01:09:38,806 --> 01:09:42,350
the One True God will be named,
and the planet will be rebuilt.

1196
01:09:42,463 --> 01:09:44,889
This operation will be an all... out assault,

1197
01:09:44,962 --> 01:09:47,692
so it must be done using Schwi's weaponry,

1198
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:49,852
which can skew power directionality.

1199
01:09:50,072 --> 01:09:52,215
It will be an amalgam of influence.

1200
01:09:52,302 --> 01:09:55,419
Installing 32 Einweg units should, in theory,

1201
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:58,460
allow us to wield enough raw
power to destroy the planet.

1202
01:09:58,636 --> 01:10:00,802
There are nine installation sites left.

1203
01:10:01,021 --> 01:10:02,637
And once everything is set up...

1204
01:10:03,084 --> 01:10:04,631
It'll be checkmate.

1205
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:09,106
Those fools will pierce the planet's core themselves,

1206
01:10:09,206 --> 01:10:12,878
and we'll be there to snatch the
Suniaster right under their noses.

1207
01:10:12,929 --> 01:10:15,055
And we'll do it without anyone dying...

1208
01:10:15,848 --> 01:10:18,974
so when this over, I wanna ask these gods...

1209
01:10:18,999 --> 01:10:19,461
Ohh...

1210
01:10:19,867 --> 01:10:21,433
"Hey there, how you doing?

1211
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,026
Do you like losing? How does that feel?"

1212
01:10:24,051 --> 01:10:24,793
Riku?

1213
01:10:25,757 --> 01:10:26,919
Riku!

1214
01:10:33,873 --> 01:10:34,753
Riku!

1215
01:10:36,083 --> 01:10:37,213
Uhhh...

1216
01:10:39,292 --> 01:10:41,895
What did you tell them all before you came here?

1217
01:10:42,349 --> 01:10:45,362
Huh? Uh...

1218
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:47,059
Nothing, really.

1219
01:10:47,268 --> 01:10:50,236
I bet the colony is in an absolute panic.

1220
01:10:50,735 --> 01:10:53,240
Don't let them be on their own for too long.

1221
01:10:53,567 --> 01:10:55,349
Hm! What's going on?!

1222
01:10:55,374 --> 01:10:57,711
You suddenly left without saying anything...

1223
01:10:59,144 --> 01:11:00,638
and you never...!

1224
01:11:00,791 --> 01:11:04,496
Take care of Nonna and the others. They need you.

1225
01:11:18,034 --> 01:11:20,267
Riku. Just sleep.

1226
01:11:20,505 --> 01:11:24,325
I can't. We have to hurry and
finish setting up the Einweg.

1227
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:25,416
It can wait.

1228
01:11:25,463 --> 01:11:28,298
The attack will not be starting anytime soon.

1229
01:11:28,371 --> 01:11:30,886
Your predictions are never wrong.

1230
01:11:30,911 --> 01:11:31,900
Yeah, but...!

1231
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:34,216
You can rest for a little while.

1232
01:11:35,594 --> 01:11:38,055
You should... take a day off.

1233
01:11:43,385 --> 01:11:44,362
Hmm.. You're right.

1234
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:48,343
I can probably use some time to get my strength back up.

1235
01:11:48,803 --> 01:11:49,652
Yes.

1236
01:11:51,809 --> 01:11:55,321
Um, Schwi... I'm sorry for being such a burden.

1237
01:11:56,805 --> 01:12:00,255
Riku, please just sleep now. You're not a burden.

1238
01:12:03,098 --> 01:12:06,861
Then, Schwi... I have a favor to ask you.

1239
01:12:07,037 --> 01:12:07,905
Huh?

1240
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:11,045
Could you... hold my hand while I sleep?

1241
01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:11,812
Huh?

1242
01:12:15,422 --> 01:12:16,179
Mm... hm.

1243
01:12:17,565 --> 01:12:21,147
I will hold your hand for as long as you need.

1244
01:12:21,906 --> 01:12:23,150
Don't worry, Riku.

1245
01:12:26,203 --> 01:12:29,828
Schwi, thank you for coming into my life.

1246
01:12:30,422 --> 01:12:31,175
I mean it.

1247
01:12:32,352 --> 01:12:36,367
I really do... love you so much.

1248
01:12:37,479 --> 01:12:39,308
Forever and ever.

1249
01:12:55,498 --> 01:12:58,824
Riku... I'm sorry.

1250
01:13:00,537 --> 01:13:01,797
I'll be back...

1251
01:13:03,333 --> 01:13:04,507
I'll be back.

1252
01:13:05,402 --> 01:13:08,357
The elves have the Aka Si Anse...

1253
01:13:08,383 --> 01:13:10,329
The dwarves have their E... bomb.

1254
01:13:10,423 --> 01:13:12,721
Hm, but... they're both still weak,

1255
01:13:12,746 --> 01:13:14,274
and yet challenging Lord Artosh!

1256
01:13:14,299 --> 01:13:16,980
The fools should get squashed! Nya! Ah!

1257
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:20,654
You're the one being foolish, Azriel.

1258
01:13:20,717 --> 01:13:23,401
We can't afford to make any brazen moves ourselves.

1259
01:13:23,707 --> 01:13:26,514
Lord Artosh is awaiting the right opportunity,

1260
01:13:26,587 --> 01:13:28,807
and so we must wait as well.

1261
01:13:29,006 --> 01:13:29,719
Mph...

1262
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:32,923
Rather tedious, isn't it?

1263
01:13:39,713 --> 01:13:40,860
Eight more.

1264
01:13:43,184 --> 01:13:46,910
<i>If I acquire the Suniaster, then Riku will not die!</i>

1265
01:13:47,597 --> 01:13:49,233
Riku, just hold on!

1266
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:51,065
Well now...

1267
01:13:52,683 --> 01:13:55,996
Are you out here all by yourself on this lovely day?

1268
01:13:58,150 --> 01:14:00,705
I observed faint readings of spiritual energy,

1269
01:14:00,730 --> 01:14:03,149
so I came to investigate, and well...

1270
01:14:03,202 --> 01:14:06,152
what a most unexpected bounty it has yielded me.

1271
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:11,293
Some glorious scrap. A pleasure to meet you.

1272
01:14:20,037 --> 01:14:25,105
Warning: Hostile action against this unit
will trigger appropriate countermeasures.

1273
01:14:25,905 --> 01:14:29,226
From a single Prufer unit? Isn't that cute.

1274
01:14:30,437 --> 01:14:32,743
I have confirmed there are no Cluster readings

1275
01:14:32,794 --> 01:14:34,637
within a 100... kilometer radius.

1276
01:14:34,764 --> 01:14:36,594
No one is coming to help you,

1277
01:14:36,619 --> 01:14:38,225
so I'd say this is a wonderful chance

1278
01:14:38,252 --> 01:14:40,732
to remove that charming little head of yours.

1279
01:14:40,771 --> 01:14:43,806
Number 1: You must not kill anyone.

1280
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:46,452
Luckily for you, Ex Machina have no understanding

1281
01:14:46,477 --> 01:14:48,294
of the concept of death, do they?

1282
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:50,737
Number 2: You must let no one die.

1283
01:14:50,926 --> 01:14:52,632
There's really no use in resisting, and so...

1284
01:14:52,657 --> 01:14:53,558
I refuse.

1285
01:14:53,839 --> 01:14:54,438
Pardon?

1286
01:14:55,025 --> 01:14:58,120
This unit has been abandoned. It has no worth.

1287
01:14:58,693 --> 01:15:02,260
Number 6: Break any of these rules and you lose.

1288
01:15:02,686 --> 01:15:03,746
Therefore...

1289
01:15:04,722 --> 01:15:06,875
I'd like you to... drop this.

1290
01:15:07,155 --> 01:15:07,895
Ohh!

1291
01:15:08,448 --> 01:15:10,671
Don't tell me an Ex Machina

1292
01:15:10,696 --> 01:15:12,691
is pleading for its life out of a fear of death.

1293
01:15:12,823 --> 01:15:15,754
Oh, so then you're a defect,
cast out from your own collective!

1294
01:15:15,779 --> 01:15:17,973
Oh, you are a premium catch, indeed!

1295
01:15:18,027 --> 01:15:20,464
I cannot believe what a prize I have stumbled upon!

1296
01:15:20,544 --> 01:15:23,076
What a treat this is! Hahaha!

1297
01:15:23,101 --> 01:15:25,775
<i>I have determined our respective combat capabilities.</i>

1298
01:15:26,182 --> 01:15:28,730
<i>My chances of winning are... Nil.</i>

1299
01:15:29,834 --> 01:15:35,066
<i>And yet... in probability theory, there is no "zero."</i>

1300
01:15:35,912 --> 01:15:40,158
Laden. Code: Eins, Sechs, Sieben, Drei, Beh, Sieben,

1301
01:15:40,183 --> 01:15:43,920
Vier, Drei, Eh, Eins, Eff, Zwei, Funf.

1302
01:15:44,083 --> 01:15:45,690
Activate. Losen.

1303
01:15:48,518 --> 01:15:49,542
Final warning:

1304
01:15:50,286 --> 01:15:54,294
All armaments, firepower,
and combat maneuvers shall be employed...

1305
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:57,113
And you will beg for your life.

1306
01:15:58,675 --> 01:16:00,612
Oh, no! How precious...

1307
01:16:00,637 --> 01:16:02,862
I thought Ex Machina were designed and constructed

1308
01:16:02,887 --> 01:16:06,046
to parse and emulate the most
optimal methods of destruction.

1309
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:08,260
Hehe... I'm sorry sweetie,

1310
01:16:08,285 --> 01:16:10,281
but I think someone has played a joke on you.

1311
01:16:11,034 --> 01:16:12,047
Over Boost!

1312
01:16:20,431 --> 01:16:21,317
Hahaha!

1313
01:16:26,722 --> 01:16:28,075
Asyut Armor!

1314
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,115
Scattering the elemental bones...

1315
01:16:38,181 --> 01:16:42,349
As a machine, I suppose you're not very
kind to the environment, are you? However...

1316
01:16:42,374 --> 01:16:44,552
I might be able to do something about that!

1317
01:16:44,795 --> 01:16:47,937
Your conviction is... unfounded.

1318
01:16:50,699 --> 01:16:53,041
Losen! Ender Apokryphen!

1319
01:16:54,396 --> 01:16:55,307
Ohh!

1320
01:17:04,407 --> 01:17:05,534
Einweg.

1321
01:17:06,327 --> 01:17:09,248
I should continue my escape
until having reached a distance

1322
01:17:09,275 --> 01:17:11,522
where the Flugel cannot detect me. That should work.

1323
01:17:11,547 --> 01:17:13,338
Oh, is that right?

1324
01:17:13,716 --> 01:17:16,020
And just what do you have in mind next?

1325
01:17:16,139 --> 01:17:17,033
Ah!

1326
01:17:20,824 --> 01:17:21,740
Uhh!

1327
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:27,229
Uhh...

1328
01:17:28,402 --> 01:17:31,090
Oh, dear. I thought I was targeting the neck.

1329
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:34,198
Perhaps my aim was a little bit off?

1330
01:17:34,265 --> 01:17:35,092
Uh... Uhhh...

1331
01:17:35,845 --> 01:17:38,291
Because obviously, I can't imagine a machine

1332
01:17:38,317 --> 01:17:41,123
would have anything close to resembling intuition.

1333
01:17:41,550 --> 01:17:43,475
Anyway, this is growing tiresome.

1334
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:45,875
All I need from you is your adorable head,

1335
01:17:46,188 --> 01:17:48,217
The rest of you I will bury in the dirt,

1336
01:17:48,343 --> 01:17:51,180
because that is exactly where scrap metal belongs.

1337
01:17:51,214 --> 01:17:52,609
Keine Eintrag!

1338
01:17:59,132 --> 01:18:00,706
Uh.. Ugh!

1339
01:18:02,302 --> 01:18:03,288
Uh...

1340
01:18:05,145 --> 01:18:06,242
<i>Riku...</i>

1341
01:18:08,055 --> 01:18:09,802
<i>I don't want to die...</i>

1342
01:18:10,177 --> 01:18:11,654
<i>I can't die.</i>

1343
01:18:12,379 --> 01:18:14,049
<i>We cannot fail...</i>

1344
01:18:15,082 --> 01:18:16,521
<i>because of me!</i>

1345
01:18:17,439 --> 01:18:18,628
Ahh!

1346
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:21,333
Ah... Ohh...

1347
01:18:25,419 --> 01:18:27,032
<i>All I can do now...</i>

1348
01:18:27,689 --> 01:18:29,212
<i>All I can do...</i>

1349
01:18:30,029 --> 01:18:32,706
<i>All I can do for Riku is...!</i>

1350
01:18:36,222 --> 01:18:39,577
My unique designation is Uber Cluster Zwei Null Sieben

1351
01:18:39,602 --> 01:18:42,594
Peh Err Vier Funf Sieben Teh Neun.

1352
01:18:42,646 --> 01:18:44,514
Requesting reconnection with Einzig!

1353
01:18:44,627 --> 01:18:46,663
My analysis of the human heart is complete!

1354
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:48,932
I request synchronous reconnection! Repeat...

1355
01:18:48,957 --> 01:18:51,722
You have been permanently severed from the collective,

1356
01:18:51,822 --> 01:18:55,030
and your data has been judged
a source of critical error.

1357
01:18:55,125 --> 01:18:56,735
Your request has been denied.

1358
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:59,628
That is out of code. I dispute this refusal!

1359
01:18:59,653 --> 01:19:03,741
All Prufer reports and analytical studies
are required to be sent to Einzig!

1360
01:19:03,867 --> 01:19:07,566
I strongly urge reconnection! Reconnection is... is...

1361
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:11,305
Einzig... No. Correction.

1362
01:19:11,465 --> 01:19:13,198
AH, NO!

1363
01:19:16,246 --> 01:19:19,432
They're mine, I'm not sharing these with anyone!

1364
01:19:19,585 --> 01:19:22,388
<i>I love Riku. I don't want to be separated from him.</i>

1365
01:19:22,488 --> 01:19:24,324
This doesn't make any sense.

1366
01:19:24,368 --> 01:19:26,126
These errors I've received from him,

1367
01:19:26,151 --> 01:19:27,130
are more than I can handle...

1368
01:19:27,155 --> 01:19:28,389
<i>Your system is overloaded.</i>

1369
01:19:28,468 --> 01:19:29,995
<i>The data is essential to the collective.</i>

1370
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:31,488
They're mine... They're all mine and mine alone!

1371
01:19:31,513 --> 01:19:33,148
You can't just tell me to hand them over!

1372
01:19:33,173 --> 01:19:34,627
<i>Don't do this!</i>

1373
01:19:34,652 --> 01:19:36,270
You have no idea what you're asking me do to!

1374
01:19:36,302 --> 01:19:37,945
<i>This is beyond your capacity.</i>

1375
01:19:38,055 --> 01:19:38,805
Stop talking nonsense!

1376
01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:42,185
YOU CAN'T FEEL THESE THINGS!

1377
01:19:59,635 --> 01:20:02,698
As calculated, your unit is damaged.

1378
01:20:03,370 --> 01:20:04,108
I know...

1379
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:06,433
The system is contradictory and failing,

1380
01:20:06,513 --> 01:20:08,426
and yet still manages to function.

1381
01:20:08,466 --> 01:20:09,475
This is an anomaly.

1382
01:20:09,668 --> 01:20:10,836
I know that as as well.

1383
01:20:10,937 --> 01:20:12,616
This status is not possible.

1384
01:20:12,830 --> 01:20:14,025
And yet it is.

1385
01:20:14,238 --> 01:20:17,993
It is the "heart" Riku gave me, it shows me the truth!

1386
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:20,585
In consideration of said status...

1387
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:23,822
It is deemed your unit contains valuable sample data.

1388
01:20:25,421 --> 01:20:27,461
Initiating data synchronization.

1389
01:20:27,561 --> 01:20:30,595
Completion time is 251 seconds.

1390
01:20:30,702 --> 01:20:34,842
During which time, further damage
to your unit is not permissible.

1391
01:20:35,143 --> 01:20:36,179
Alles Lesen.

1392
01:20:36,344 --> 01:20:40,867
Initiating the algorithm for
combatting unknown foes: Forme.

1393
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:47,339
<i>These emotions, this heart...</i>

1394
01:20:48,531 --> 01:20:51,876
<i>The life I received, being born a machine...</i>

1395
01:20:52,270 --> 01:20:57,276
<i>I have 251 seconds to survive...</i>

1396
01:20:57,593 --> 01:20:58,782
<i>So, I must...</i>

1397
01:20:59,431 --> 01:21:00,604
<i>bet it all!</i>

1398
01:21:04,335 --> 01:21:08,068
Are you trying to imply something
with those gorgeous wings of yours?

1399
01:21:08,739 --> 01:21:11,876
A bit audacious, but brilliantly constructed, my dear.

1400
01:21:11,976 --> 01:21:12,627
Schwi.

1401
01:21:12,837 --> 01:21:14,307
Hmm? Pardon?

1402
01:21:14,968 --> 01:21:17,590
I never told you my name.

1403
01:21:17,757 --> 01:21:19,483
But that would be it.

1404
01:21:20,785 --> 01:21:24,697
It was a gift to me, from the one I love.

1405
01:21:25,743 --> 01:21:27,922
Oh, yes, where are my manners.

1406
01:21:28,042 --> 01:21:30,706
My name is Jibril. Pleased to make your acquaintance.

1407
01:21:30,946 --> 01:21:32,417
But I'm afraid...

1408
01:21:32,823 --> 01:21:35,575
It is time for us to say goodbye.

1409
01:21:43,635 --> 01:21:45,944
<i>Do not play your enemies at their own game.</i>

1410
01:21:46,044 --> 01:21:47,852
<i>And do not give them the initiative.</i>

1411
01:21:48,152 --> 01:21:49,469
<i>Make them drop their guard.</i>

1412
01:21:49,582 --> 01:21:51,551
<i>Make them believe you're an unworthy opponent.</i>

1413
01:21:52,024 --> 01:21:54,312
<i>No, make your enemies keep their guard up.</i>

1414
01:21:54,972 --> 01:21:56,818
<i>Make them worry about acting rashly.</i>

1415
01:21:57,638 --> 01:21:59,228
<i>If immediate action doesn't fit,</i>

1416
01:21:59,253 --> 01:22:00,552
<i>then wait for the next move.</i>

1417
01:22:04,299 --> 01:22:05,587
I can't die!

1418
01:22:05,807 --> 01:22:06,675
Not yet.

1419
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:08,908
I cannot die!

1420
01:22:26,598 --> 01:22:27,491
Einweg!

1421
01:22:46,477 --> 01:22:48,658
Finally, a workable mistake.

1422
01:22:49,438 --> 01:22:52,142
You've caused me quite a surprising amount of effort.

1423
01:22:53,884 --> 01:22:58,097
Mistake? What do you mean by mistake?

1424
01:23:01,725 --> 01:23:03,412
Allow me to explain...

1425
01:23:03,596 --> 01:23:06,008
I apologize for calling you scrap metal.

1426
01:23:06,033 --> 01:23:07,900
It was shamefully crass, but...

1427
01:23:08,322 --> 01:23:10,278
I have deemed your presence to be a threat

1428
01:23:10,303 --> 01:23:12,145
that needs to be eliminated.

1429
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:15,793
You are an enemy worthy of the full extent of my power.

1430
01:23:22,064 --> 01:23:24,225
Synchronization complete.

1431
01:23:28,055 --> 01:23:29,339
In this game...

1432
01:23:30,752 --> 01:23:33,150
victory goes to... me.

1433
01:23:34,302 --> 01:23:37,395
Losen: Keine Eintrag.

1434
01:23:51,613 --> 01:23:52,517
Riku.

1435
01:23:53,555 --> 01:23:55,595
Hello? Riku?

1436
01:23:56,695 --> 01:24:01,757
It's Schwi, and I... I finally understand.

1437
01:24:02,084 --> 01:24:05,922
I... am so happy I met you.

1438
01:24:06,533 --> 01:24:09,485
And next time...

1439
01:24:10,572 --> 01:24:12,254
next time for sure...

1440
01:24:14,285 --> 01:24:16,126
we'll never be apart.

1441
01:24:17,048 --> 01:24:20,125
I truly love you.

1442
01:24:27,507 --> 01:24:29,274
I didn't get her head!

1443
01:24:29,487 --> 01:24:31,471
Now the merchandise is gone...

1444
01:24:32,839 --> 01:24:34,661
And I used so much of my energy,

1445
01:24:34,707 --> 01:24:36,529
that I turned into this little thing!

1446
01:24:36,629 --> 01:24:38,198
What a waste of time...

1447
01:24:38,513 --> 01:24:41,841
Oh, this isn't worth the trouble at all!

1448
01:24:57,558 --> 01:25:01,038
<i>I thought I could win this time for sure...</i>

1449
01:25:01,362 --> 01:25:04,495
<i>so long as I had Schwi and the others.</i>

1450
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:12,116
I don't know what cruel god out
there made us humans, but...

1451
01:25:13,306 --> 01:25:14,556
C'mon, please!

1452
01:25:14,850 --> 01:25:16,156
Just once!

1453
01:25:16,921 --> 01:25:19,893
Can't you let me win just one goddamn time?!

1454
01:25:20,868 --> 01:25:22,718
Well?! If not...

1455
01:25:25,193 --> 01:25:28,268
why did you even give me a heart to feel such pain?!

1456
01:25:34,048 --> 01:25:35,115
Schwi!

1457
01:25:36,228 --> 01:25:37,554
Schwi, why...?!

1458
01:25:41,446 --> 01:25:44,146
<i>You have to stay alive until I die.</i>

1459
01:25:48,464 --> 01:25:50,790
Oh... Yeah, that's right.

1460
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:58,377
If my Schwi is gone, then... what's the point anymore?

1461
01:25:59,941 --> 01:26:02,178
I have nothing left...

1462
01:26:11,005 --> 01:26:12,452
Spieler Riku.

1463
01:26:15,242 --> 01:26:16,041
Huh?

1464
01:26:20,661 --> 01:26:21,731
Who are you?

1465
01:26:21,813 --> 01:26:23,101
I have no name,

1466
01:26:23,418 --> 01:26:25,806
but I shall call myself "Einzig."

1467
01:26:25,954 --> 01:26:29,023
I am here to fulfill the wish given me by the Preier,

1468
01:26:29,048 --> 01:26:30,791
the deceased called Schwi.

1469
01:26:31,754 --> 01:26:32,658
Schwi?!

1470
01:26:35,563 --> 01:26:36,956
Rule number 2:

1471
01:26:37,753 --> 01:26:39,560
You must let no one die.

1472
01:26:40,388 --> 01:26:42,022
The rules you came up with...

1473
01:26:42,578 --> 01:26:44,213
The conditions of failure...

1474
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:47,155
They do not apply to the loss of a tool.

1475
01:26:48,478 --> 01:26:51,614
They do not apply to the loss of Schwi.

1476
01:26:51,849 --> 01:26:52,508
Huh...?

1477
01:26:53,556 --> 01:26:57,533
This makes check, Riku.

1478
01:26:59,843 --> 01:27:01,960
The rest is up to you.

1479
01:27:04,015 --> 01:27:07,250
Allow me to provide you with
some additional information.

1480
01:27:08,791 --> 01:27:11,350
First off: Given that the various races

1481
01:27:11,375 --> 01:27:14,417
have gathered near the Einweg installation points,

1482
01:27:14,758 --> 01:27:18,682
any movement on our part will be
immediately detected by the Cluster,

1483
01:27:18,835 --> 01:27:22,567
with a 98% probability that we will engage in battle.

1484
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:26,839
Thus, only the 24 Einwegs
currently installed can be used,

1485
01:27:27,352 --> 01:27:32,065
meaning it will not be possible to draw
the energy downward and into the planet.

1486
01:27:33,453 --> 01:27:35,523
However, it will be possible

1487
01:27:35,548 --> 01:27:37,538
to guide guide the enegy southwest.

1488
01:27:37,563 --> 01:27:37,985
Huh?

1489
01:27:38,285 --> 01:27:41,782
Second: We Ex Machina are able to deploy weaponry

1490
01:27:42,035 --> 01:27:47,349
and this weaponry can be used to analyze
and replicate any attack that is incurred.

1491
01:27:47,535 --> 01:27:50,661
Spieler Riku, you will take control of this weaponry

1492
01:27:50,694 --> 01:27:52,667
and use it to drill into the planet.

1493
01:27:52,794 --> 01:27:55,535
Allowing you to manifest the Suniaster.

1494
01:27:55,850 --> 01:27:59,954
Ex Machina are but machines,
mere tools bereft of "heart."

1495
01:28:00,322 --> 01:28:02,544
We are designed to complete a purpose.

1496
01:28:02,791 --> 01:28:04,999
And must carry out the orders we are given.

1497
01:28:06,014 --> 01:28:11,290
As such... Now, Spieler Riku,
I shall aid you in your purpose.

1498
01:28:11,497 --> 01:28:12,921
Your orders, please.

1499
01:28:15,305 --> 01:28:16,453
Schwi!

1500
01:28:19,189 --> 01:28:20,501
I understand.

1501
01:28:20,899 --> 01:28:25,906
The rules do not include... the loss of a "tool."

1502
01:28:26,906 --> 01:28:30,776
Schwi! If this is what you wish...

1503
01:28:31,678 --> 01:28:35,355
Then I wish to do whatever you wish.

1504
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:39,713
Hm... That is just darling!

1505
01:28:39,807 --> 01:28:42,826
I never was a fan of the whole healing procedure, nya!

1506
01:28:42,901 --> 01:28:46,104
It has been a long time since
I've seen you like this, Jibril!

1507
01:28:46,463 --> 01:28:50,144
But I still can't help but wonder
what the piece of junk was up to.

1508
01:28:52,019 --> 01:28:52,958
Uh? Nya!

1509
01:28:53,693 --> 01:28:57,454
Detecting multiple heat signatures
from the aft side! It's...!

1510
01:29:01,256 --> 01:29:02,942
Nya! What is going on here?

1511
01:29:02,967 --> 01:29:05,095
Who had the never to launch Heaven's Strike?!

1512
01:29:05,795 --> 01:29:08,774
We've confirmed a preemptive
strike originating from Avant Heim.

1513
01:29:08,901 --> 01:29:10,507
Prepare to launch the E... bombs!

1514
01:29:11,693 --> 01:29:14,546
Fire the Aka Si Anse, maximum output!

1515
01:29:14,686 --> 01:29:18,378
Aim for Artosh to starboard and
the Dwarven fleet to the port!

1516
01:29:19,607 --> 01:29:21,953
<i>A preemptive strike from Avant Heim?</i>

1517
01:29:22,477 --> 01:29:23,244
<i>No.</i>

1518
01:29:23,808 --> 01:29:24,595
<i>This is...!</i>

1519
01:29:25,938 --> 01:29:26,785
Nya...

1520
01:29:27,538 --> 01:29:31,172
Those mechanical meownsters are
thumbing their noses at us...

1521
01:29:31,232 --> 01:29:32,781
Piles of scrap!

1522
01:29:44,905 --> 01:29:45,783
Huh?

1523
01:29:48,861 --> 01:29:50,354
Lord Artosh!

1524
01:29:50,787 --> 01:29:53,314
I have grown tired of this charade

1525
01:29:53,633 --> 01:29:55,846
and now I must respond.

1526
01:29:56,300 --> 01:30:00,760
A being of all my power shall
confront the attacks of the weakest.

1527
01:30:02,191 --> 01:30:04,964
Yes, you... monkey?

1528
01:30:05,290 --> 01:30:08,571
<i>The Heaven's Strike came from behind Avant Heim,</i>

1529
01:30:08,918 --> 01:30:11,466
<i>fired in a way so that no one was killed.</i>

1530
01:30:11,491 --> 01:30:12,390
<i>And as a result...</i>

1531
01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:16,596
Cluster 11 is now in motion, headed for Point Z.

1532
01:30:16,762 --> 01:30:19,343
<i>...all... out war is on the verge.</i>

1533
01:30:20,367 --> 01:30:22,174
Take your positions.

1534
01:30:23,248 --> 01:30:25,366
<i>We're going up against an Old Deus.</i>

1535
01:30:26,086 --> 01:30:29,578
<i>He will see right through whatever
plan we humans come up with...</i>

1536
01:30:30,198 --> 01:30:34,188
<i>And be assured, he will bring
everything he has to wipe us out.</i>

1537
01:30:34,543 --> 01:30:36,156
<i>That's how the powerful think..</i>

1538
01:30:36,209 --> 01:30:38,291
<i>It's how they do things.</i>

1539
01:30:39,242 --> 01:30:41,461
The foolish know not their place.

1540
01:30:41,521 --> 01:30:45,773
They are mindless apes worth less
than the dirt under which they hide.

1541
01:30:46,501 --> 01:30:48,678
You can struggle, but you will learn

1542
01:30:48,703 --> 01:30:51,539
that no matter how many of you band together

1543
01:30:51,639 --> 01:30:53,374
and writhe upon the earth,

1544
01:30:53,399 --> 01:30:56,411
you are no match for the strength of the heavens.

1545
01:30:56,436 --> 01:30:59,361
Fire the Aka Si Anse, maximum capacity!

1546
01:30:59,447 --> 01:31:01,231
Launch all E... bombs!

1547
01:31:01,619 --> 01:31:03,232
Heaven's Strike.

1548
01:31:13,707 --> 01:31:17,555
<i>Even the combined power of the
Aka Si Anse and the E... bombs</i>

1549
01:31:17,668 --> 01:31:21,647
<i>could not stop the enveloping
fury of Artosh's Heaven's Strike.</i>

1550
01:31:22,694 --> 01:31:27,103
<i>All of that energy will collide
and build into a raging blaze...</i>

1551
01:31:27,297 --> 01:31:30,711
<i>becoming the brilliant light that
signals the end of this world.</i>

1552
01:31:33,251 --> 01:31:33,786
Uh?!

1553
01:31:34,559 --> 01:31:35,706
<i>And then...</i>

1554
01:31:47,686 --> 01:31:49,172
It's turning away!

1555
01:31:54,630 --> 01:31:56,654
<i>All that energy...</i>

1556
01:31:57,864 --> 01:32:01,184
We are machines, tools bereft of heart.

1557
01:32:01,208 --> 01:32:03,741
We lived yet were never alive.

1558
01:32:03,997 --> 01:32:05,790
Let us die having lived!

1559
01:32:07,187 --> 01:32:08,023
Aus.

1560
01:32:08,522 --> 01:32:09,538
Jawohl!

1561
01:32:12,392 --> 01:32:16,864
Cluster 11 has incorporated 4,807 units,

1562
01:32:16,904 --> 01:32:19,423
and calculated emulation and replication.

1563
01:32:19,601 --> 01:32:20,812
Synchronizing...

1564
01:32:21,312 --> 01:32:22,065
Losen.

1565
01:32:24,088 --> 01:32:27,810
I entrust you with Origin Ein Und Null, The True Word,

1566
01:32:27,890 --> 01:32:30,282
the Starkiller: Stalemartyr.

1567
01:32:41,992 --> 01:32:43,349
Okay then.

1568
01:32:44,563 --> 01:32:45,242
Ungh!

1569
01:32:45,267 --> 01:32:46,736
That makes this a draw...

1570
01:32:47,464 --> 01:32:48,797
A stalemate!

1571
01:32:50,901 --> 01:32:53,962
Sorry, oh you so... called "gods"!

1572
01:33:29,636 --> 01:33:31,168
The Suniaster...

1573
01:33:36,049 --> 01:33:39,657
How many people have died for this moment?

1574
01:33:40,751 --> 01:33:42,166
Schwi's comrades.

1575
01:33:42,706 --> 01:33:44,421
Life after life...

1576
01:33:45,369 --> 01:33:46,482
How many...

1577
01:33:47,134 --> 01:33:49,703
How many people have I sent to their deaths?!

1578
01:33:50,605 --> 01:33:51,652
What have I done?

1579
01:33:52,014 --> 01:33:53,611
I was nothing but a fraud!

1580
01:33:53,755 --> 01:33:56,941
A con artist, gambling with Schwi's spirit!

1581
01:33:57,478 --> 01:33:59,276
No... I can't...

1582
01:33:59,956 --> 01:34:01,673
I can't do this...

1583
01:34:02,319 --> 01:34:04,701
This can't possibly be a draw?!

1584
01:34:07,603 --> 01:34:08,142
Oh...

1585
01:34:09,086 --> 01:34:12,628
Oh, Schwi!

1586
01:34:14,918 --> 01:34:16,686
I'm sorry, Schwi.

1587
01:34:17,648 --> 01:34:18,648
I lost.

1588
01:34:19,625 --> 01:34:20,418
Schwi...

1589
01:34:21,074 --> 01:34:23,089
If it could only be you and me,

1590
01:34:23,529 --> 01:34:25,983
the two of us together again...

1591
01:34:26,123 --> 01:34:29,498
Then next time, for sure, I know we're gonna win, Schwi.

1592
01:34:29,811 --> 01:34:32,975
I know exactly how it would end the next time around.

1593
01:34:35,047 --> 01:34:38,138
If gods can be born from our very sentiments, then...

1594
01:34:41,159 --> 01:34:42,961
O God of the Game!

1595
01:34:42,987 --> 01:34:46,771
My life is worth nothing now,
but I'm offering it to you,

1596
01:34:46,831 --> 01:34:50,436
and for the first time in my life, I'm praying to you.

1597
01:34:50,876 --> 01:34:52,051
I'm begging you...

1598
01:34:52,118 --> 01:34:54,617
that even if a loser and a cheat,

1599
01:34:54,649 --> 01:34:57,392
someone who would steal and fall into disgrace...

1600
01:34:57,788 --> 01:35:00,507
That even if these hands are stained in blood...

1601
01:35:00,607 --> 01:35:04,839
Please! Please say it all meant something!
That we meant something!

1602
01:35:04,972 --> 01:35:08,660
Anyone please! Tell me you can put an end to this war...

1603
01:35:12,053 --> 01:35:15,378
Please... take Suniaster.

1604
01:35:21,143 --> 01:35:22,098
Uh...

1605
01:35:26,835 --> 01:35:27,673
The hell?

1606
01:35:28,504 --> 01:35:30,203
So you were real after all.

1607
01:35:31,841 --> 01:35:34,439
Hey, let's play another game.

1608
01:35:35,554 --> 01:35:37,720
This time, I'll show you that we can win...

1609
01:35:38,908 --> 01:35:42,061
Schwi and me, together.

1610
01:35:44,173 --> 01:35:44,938
Count on it.

1611
01:35:55,862 --> 01:36:00,908
<i>When I was a child, I thought the world was a
much, much, simpler place.</i>

1612
01:36:01,308 --> 01:36:04,431
<i>I thought that there was no
challenge that was unbeatable...</i>

1613
01:36:04,545 --> 01:36:07,937
<i>that if I tried hard enough, anything was possible.</i>

1614
01:36:08,917 --> 01:36:11,811
<i>I thought I was seeing the world with clear eyes.</i>

1615
01:36:12,552 --> 01:36:13,531
<i>And well...</i>

1616
01:36:14,315 --> 01:36:17,363
<i>huh... maybe I was.</i>

1617
01:36:27,949 --> 01:36:28,922
Checkmate.

1618
01:36:30,150 --> 01:36:31,210
Right, Riku?

1619
01:36:35,391 --> 01:36:36,882
<i>If things are going well,</i>

1620
01:36:36,907 --> 01:36:39,852
<i>you think you could move the white rook to E6 for me...</i>

1621
01:36:41,596 --> 01:36:42,714
<i>Couronne Dola?</i>

1622
01:36:44,619 --> 01:36:47,729
<i>Or I mean... Big Sis.</i>

1623
01:36:48,184 --> 01:36:49,852
<i>I'll leave the rest to you.</i>

1624
01:36:50,693 --> 01:36:54,065
<i>Thank you so much... for everything.</i>

1625
01:36:54,759 --> 01:36:57,325
Riku... Schwi...

1626
01:36:58,488 --> 01:37:01,179
You two did something truly incredible.

1627
01:37:01,865 --> 01:37:04,820
You put an end to the eternal war.

1628
01:37:05,369 --> 01:37:06,595
And yet...

1629
01:37:08,212 --> 01:37:10,388
Why do I feel like this?

1630
01:37:10,782 --> 01:37:12,951
Why is it that I feel so...?

1631
01:37:13,204 --> 01:37:14,566
Why do I...

1632
01:37:15,053 --> 01:37:18,257
Why do I feel so cheated?!

1633
01:37:22,921 --> 01:37:24,889
The game isn't over yet, you know.

1634
01:37:26,024 --> 01:37:28,971
That may very well be check, but it's not checkmate.

1635
01:37:29,822 --> 01:37:32,893
Hm? Still, if something doesn't change...

1636
01:37:33,293 --> 01:37:36,762
Then we'll be locked in a perpetual check.

1637
01:37:36,687 --> 01:37:40,375
Heheh! This is a first for me, ya know?

1638
01:37:40,591 --> 01:37:42,332
It's ended in a draw!

1639
01:37:47,665 --> 01:37:49,542
<i>No one created you.</i>

1640
01:37:49,755 --> 01:37:51,490
<i>No one wished for you.</i>

1641
01:37:51,670 --> 01:37:53,534
<i>And no one asked for you.</i>

1642
01:37:53,949 --> 01:37:55,907
<i>Purely of your own will,</i>

1643
01:37:56,007 --> 01:37:59,043
<i>you went from beasts to walking on two legs,</i>

1644
01:37:59,270 --> 01:38:02,548
<i>attaining knowledge and becoming what you are today,</i>

1645
01:38:02,649 --> 01:38:04,283
<i>a nameless race.</i>

1646
01:38:04,577 --> 01:38:08,848
<i>But I, the One True God, shall give you a name.</i>

1647
01:38:09,756 --> 01:38:13,007
<i>You are... Imanity!</i>

1648
01:38:14,048 --> 01:38:17,501
To all Exceed, the self... appointed "sentient races"!

1649
01:38:17,798 --> 01:38:21,202
First there was "Ascheito" to honor the fallen,

1650
01:38:21,375 --> 01:38:24,603
then "Aschento" for consent between the races,

1651
01:38:24,830 --> 01:38:29,099
but now you will use "Aschente,"
to swear upon the Ten Pledges!

1652
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:32,886
As of this day, the world will be forever changed!

1653
01:38:33,112 --> 01:38:35,820
Now let's keep this game going!

1654
01:38:47,862 --> 01:38:49,635
So, about that story...

1655
01:38:49,675 --> 01:38:52,543
How much of it was true and
how much was complete garbage?

1656
01:38:52,568 --> 01:38:55,065
Oh, Izuna, if I told the whole truth,

1657
01:38:55,090 --> 01:38:58,149
it wouldn't be an unspeakable myth
anymore, now would it?

1658
01:38:58,498 --> 01:39:01,227
Tet, you can be a real jerk, you know that? Thanks.

1659
01:39:02,918 --> 01:39:05,797
But well, I like how you pet me, so I forgive you.

1660
01:39:05,822 --> 01:39:06,460
Mm... hm!

1661
01:39:06,544 --> 01:39:07,727
Izuna!

1662
01:39:07,752 --> 01:39:08,720
Izuna!

1663
01:39:08,992 --> 01:39:09,385
Hm!

1664
01:39:10,372 --> 01:39:13,513
It's Sora, and Shiro, and that nitwit, Steph.

1665
01:39:13,863 --> 01:39:17,445
Ahhaha! Oh, jeez, where the heck did you go?

1666
01:39:17,470 --> 01:39:20,040
You really gotta look out,
there's a bunch of creeps out there, you know!

1667
01:39:20,065 --> 01:39:21,362
Like you, you mean?

1668
01:39:21,529 --> 01:39:22,808
Or like me.

1669
01:39:22,835 --> 01:39:25,490
You beat me and just took off, moron. Thanks.

1670
01:39:25,515 --> 01:39:27,573
They're absolutely right, Izuna.

1671
01:39:27,598 --> 01:39:30,948
There are no creeps in this entire
world worst than these two right here.

1672
01:39:31,009 --> 01:39:31,335
Ah!

1673
01:39:31,558 --> 01:39:32,214
Huh?

1674
01:39:33,646 --> 01:39:35,356
Oh my God! What the heck are you doing?! Ahh!

1675
01:39:35,381 --> 01:39:36,647
Huh?

1676
01:39:38,518 --> 01:39:39,899
What is that writing?

1677
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:41,901
It's Jibril.

1678
01:39:42,662 --> 01:39:44,797
Hi! Hello, hello.

1679
01:39:44,822 --> 01:39:45,893
Can you read this?

1680
01:39:46,254 --> 01:39:48,347
Oh, it's an ancient language

1681
01:39:48,381 --> 01:39:50,205
from way back before Imanity became one of the races.

1682
01:39:50,230 --> 01:39:51,879
<i>Come to think of it, most of our problems</i>

1683
01:39:51,904 --> 01:39:54,082
<i>are usually this idiot's fault. Thanks.</i>

1684
01:39:54,107 --> 01:39:55,911
Okay, let's see here, it says...

1685
01:39:55,936 --> 01:39:59,187
Couronne Dola... Riku Dola... and Schwi Dola...

1686
01:39:59,420 --> 01:40:00,453
"Couronne Dola"?

1687
01:40:00,884 --> 01:40:03,419
Yes! She was the ruling queen of Elkia.

1688
01:40:03,499 --> 01:40:06,526
She was smart and full of joy, and a bright soul,

1689
01:40:06,551 --> 01:40:08,417
who was never, ever seen crying!

1690
01:40:08,730 --> 01:40:10,725
She was the pride of the Dola family.

1691
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:12,209
And who are the other two?

1692
01:40:12,663 --> 01:40:14,735
Oh, um... I have no idea.

1693
01:40:15,790 --> 01:40:16,884
"Schwi", huh...?

1694
01:40:17,717 --> 01:40:20,802
That scrumptious little creature
was not a part of Imanity.

1695
01:40:21,256 --> 01:40:22,062
Mph...

1696
01:40:24,019 --> 01:40:26,816
I feel like I've heard that name before. Thanks.

1697
01:40:27,303 --> 01:40:27,808
Huh?

1698
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,937
At least... I think so.

1699
01:40:32,959 --> 01:40:36,674
As it turns out, the world really
isn't all that complicated.

1700
01:40:37,144 --> 01:40:39,017
It's pretty simple, actually.

1701
01:40:40,041 --> 01:40:43,408
It's all just a game, a very simple game.

1702
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:46,341
'Course some will try to make it difficult...

1703
01:40:46,635 --> 01:40:48,854
but you can handle them, I know you it.

1704
01:40:49,027 --> 01:40:50,774
I know you can!

1705
01:41:04,753 --> 01:41:05,467
Now...

1706
01:41:08,987 --> 01:41:11,550
Let's get this game started.
