1
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,166
Attention, ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,791
We are now on final approach

3
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:25,708
to our destination port of St.
Lowel, the largest city on Mars.

4
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,791
We hope you had
a pleasant flight.

5
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:31,541
Today's temperature is
a cool eleven degrees Celsius.

6
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:34,666
The oxygen percentage
reading is seven percent.

7
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,500
Reports have come in of slight
unrest throughout the city,

8
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:39,458
due to public demonstrations.

9
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:42,500
We hope you have an enjoyable
time during your stay on Mars.

10
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:43,666
Thank you.

11
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,041
No!

12
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,041
Jennifer!

13
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,208
Please remain seated and
keep your seatbelts fastened

14
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,250
until we have come
to a full stop.

15
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,875
We wish to thank our
passengers for their patronage,

16
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,208
and we look forward to
servicing you in the future.

17
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:50,708
Have a nice day.

18
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,666
Huh?

19
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,666
The cargo area?

20
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,208
Huh?

21
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,458
Make sure units are covering
the rooftop and the rear!

22
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,500
All in a day's work, Lieutenant.

23
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,625
And don't try and
bill me for that bike!

24
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,750
Hey, watch out!

25
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:54,666
Hmm.

26
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:56,958
Freeze!

27
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,333
Get your hands up!

28
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,958
I said get your hands up! Now!

29
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,125
What's up?

30
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,291
Detective, you'd
better stay back.

31
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,541
Handle it.

32
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,250
Get back!

33
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,291
Tell me you're
packin' a gun, sheriff.

34
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,666
How 'bout you?

35
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,208
Shit! A bunch of
cowboys up the ass,

36
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,000
and not one of 'em's got a gun.

37
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:42,708
Stop, now!

38
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,375
Let me down! Let me down!

39
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,291
Look, that bastard's
getting away!

40
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,583
What the hell?

41
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:06,958
No!

42
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,375
Stay out of this, Detective!

43
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:15,458
This is the Martian Police
Department, Detective Sylibus.

44
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,041
Did you have a nice trip?

45
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,125
It's McCanon!

46
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,375
He killed her!

47
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,041
The country singer?

48
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,375
Haha!

49
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,750
Dammit!

50
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:25,833
Huh?

51
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,375
Hey wait! What the
hell are you doing?

52
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,833
You damn lunatic!

53
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,791
This is insane.

54
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:48,041
Where'd you go. I was
so worried about you!

55
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,416
Dad.

56
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,791
Her name was Kelly McCanon.

57
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,541
She was a famous country singer.

58
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,083
In fact, the only country
singer in the universe.

59
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,958
I guess this means
they're extinct.

60
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,416
And the suspect?

61
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,041
Tell me, is that crazy
get-up you're wearing

62
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,791
a standard issue
Martian police uniform?

63
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:15,791
Course not!

64
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,083
So, what's your name?

65
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,500
The name's Armitage.

66
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,791
Ooh, what a sexy back.

67
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,916
I just love broad shoulders.

68
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,625
Hey!

69
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,125
What was that for?
I was just being nice!

70
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,333
Listen, what's going on here?

71
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,250
Is this somebody's
idea of a sick joke?

72
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,500
Annie Oakley here
isn't even human.

73
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,791
It's a damn robot.

74
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,875
What's wrong?

75
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,166
What's going on?

76
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,250
Spaceport police.

77
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,125
This is their jurisdiction.

78
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,875
In response to the
Kelly McCanon incident,

79
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,541
the Martian Police
Department has created TCS,

80
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,166
Technological Criminal Swat,
to investigate.

81
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,833
Lieutenant Randolph, of the MPD,
declined further details.

82
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,083
The million dollar
question is...

83
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:24,625
Just what do we have here?
A woman or a robot?

84
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,916
Sir, results from my
preliminary findings are,

85
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,625
well, uh, very interesting.

86
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,541
I learned that the uh,
victim, shall we call her,

87
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,958
is not a human nor a cyborg.

88
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,291
After examining the body,

89
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,875
I concluded she was
entirely a robot.

90
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,666
Her body tissue was of
manmade organic origin.

91
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,708
And she functioned through
artificial intelligence.

92
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:48,000
While no one is capable of
creating a human brain, yet,

93
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:51,208
her computer brain
was very sophisticated.

94
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,833
And, as I mentioned,

95
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,708
her physical construction
was created organically.

96
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,291
But it was done using

97
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,291
a technology much more advanced
than the Second series models.

98
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,833
I believe that the
victim was a prototype

99
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,541
built outside of regulations.

100
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,666
It could also, um,

101
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,000
mean that there are other
illegal models like her,

102
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,875
running around under our noses.

103
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,458
Yes, thank you.

104
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,666
And now Detective Sylibus will
give his report about the scene.

105
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:24,958
Hi, I'm Ross Sylibus, from
the Chicago Police Department.

106
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,791
Uh, the suspects appeared,
I mean, they seemed like

107
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:37,916
they wanted to transport the
body without anyone noticing.

108
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,291
Um, probably to finish their
work somewhere else in private.

109
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,125
Officer Armitage there had
been trailing the suspects,

110
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,000
and then all hell broke loose.

111
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,458
Armitage, can you fill us in?

112
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:53,250
Well, I trailed the suspects
and saw they were equipped.

113
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,125
I didn't think they were
carrying a dead robot.

114
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,791
So what the hell
does that mean?

115
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,458
That it was McCanon's
imposter riding the shuttle?

116
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,625
Shut up, Eddie.

117
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,666
What did her manager
have to say?

118
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,125
Well, sir, according to him,

119
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,833
he didn't see any difference
between the woman he sat with

120
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,166
and the real
country-western singer.

121
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,125
And nobody saw her come out
of the arriving terminal.

122
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:18,666
The only suspicious passenger
he saw was Detective Sylibus.

123
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,500
Well, it seems that
the trick for us

124
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,750
is to find out where
the real McCanon is.

125
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,208
You know, maybe she's
feeling her wild oats.

126
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,791
Might've found herself
some kinda wild lover.

127
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,416
Christ, Eddie, will you zip it!

128
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,500
Just how was she acting
inside the shuttle?

129
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,916
She acted fine.

130
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,250
She was holding a normal
conversation.

131
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,166
Nothing seemed unusual
about it to me.

132
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,250
Hell, I wouldn't have been able
to tell her apart from a human.

133
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:46,833
Uh-huh. Uh...

134
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:50,291
Are you tellin' us that this
robot was really McCanon?

135
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,583
You think that prima donna was
a machine from the beginning?

136
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,333
No, I'm saying you
can't distinguish it

137
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,291
from a human being.

138
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,833
Oh, hey, yeah, Armitage,

139
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,500
when you realized the corpse was
a robot, you seemed shocked,

140
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,791
even upset.

141
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,750
Did you think
something was wrong?

142
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,000
Well, did ya?

143
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,791
No, sir.

144
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,000
I hope you like your new place.

145
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,041
It's probably not as nice
as you're used to,

146
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,875
but there's a
housing shortage here.

147
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,375
Besides, the rent is
reasonable on this end of town.

148
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,625
Gee, a regular Park Avenue.

149
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:32,750
Hmm.

150
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,916
Whoa.

151
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,083
Twelfth floor.

152
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,583
I'm sure it's better
when you get inside.

153
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,416
Hmm.

154
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,416
Ugh, it smells stale.

155
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,375
Hey, is that all your luggage?

156
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:00,791
Well, you know,

157
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,916
with all the excitement at
the baggage claim today...

158
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,750
Ah, just as well.

159
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,416
Probably stuff I wouldn't
have needed anyway.

160
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,333
There's enough trash
from Earth here already.

161
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,458
Well, you do have
a point about that.

162
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,125
Oh, look at this.

163
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:23,375
This is a tape sent by the
suspect of yesterday's

164
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,458
St. Lowel spaceport shooting.

What is this?
Some kinda memorial program?

Hey that's the guy!

171
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,125
I'll go take care of
the baggage, babe.

Alright, hurry back.

What are you doing?

176
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,458
Leave me alone.

181
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,458
My god.

182

Jessica.

183

This has been unedited
material from video files

184
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,166
as sent to us by
the murder suspect.

185
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,333
Here to comment on the footage
is Miss Julian Blanshin,

186
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,958
an activist in the movement
to drive out robots.

187
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,166
It's amazing.

188
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,416
They're everywhere you look.

189
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,375
Ya'd think they could
build something else.

190
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,125
You're here pretty early,
Detective.

191
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:44,833
She's gone already,

192
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,666
the badge-toting
terror in hot pants.

193
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,416
Hey, you want some free advice?

194
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,958
Try not to get your
partner killed this time.

195
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,708
Here's one more thing,

196
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:01,875
when she puts on
her visor, watch out!

197
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,208
And before I forget, here.

198
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,625
She's clean, gassed,
and waiting downstairs.

199
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,916
And welcome to your new home.

200
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,625
Robots get out!

201
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:27,416
Robots get out!

202
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,833
Get out right now!

203
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,833
Get out right now!

204
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,583
Give us back our jobs!

205
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,541
Give us back our jobs!

206
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,333
I'm sorry to have
to break you in so soon,

207
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,041
but we may as well get started.

208
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,500
Uh, but Lieutenant,

209
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,666
is our section supposed
to handle this matter?

210
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,750
Hmm? Just what do you
mean by that, Ross?

211
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,708
Well, you see, the victim
was definitely a robot,

212
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,458
so I don't see why MPD should
get stuck dealing with it.

213
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,166
Shouldn't we let some
other government agency

214
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,541
take it off our hands?

215
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:02,916
I wish it was that easy,

216
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,541
but it's the robot's
origins that we're interested

217
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,083
in finding out about.

218
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,083
As you may not
be aware, Sylibus,

219
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:11,375
people here consider illegal
robot technology and replication

220
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,041
to be a criminal offense.

221
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,583
Yes, sir. I guess so.

222
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,833
Are you going to tell me why
you wanted to transfer to Mars?

223
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,583
Well, I'd rather not, sir.

224
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,125
As you like.

225
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:28,250
Let me warn you. If you have
misguided compassion for robots,

226
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,916
you won't make it here.

227
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,333
Do you hear us?

228
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,500
We want our jobs!

229
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,916
We want our jobs!

230
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,166
Wow, what a place.

231
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,208
Excuse me, Miss.

232
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,166
Why not?

233
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm very sorry, but
I've explained to you

234
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,916
that I cannot allow
you to see him.

235
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,416
You're telling me
he doesn't remember

236
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,416
the name Armitage at all?

237
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,916
Mr. Asakura said
he's never heard of you.

238
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,583
Listen, don't mess
with me, you little bitch.

239
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,125
You'd better get out of here,

240
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,875
or I'll call the
security gadget.

241
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:25,666
Yeah, I guess it's useless
talking to a Second like you.

242
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,833
Hey!

243
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,083
Ah, just cancel
that appointment.

244
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,375
Let me go!

245
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,208
How dare you!

246
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,625
I have business here!

247
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,291
Robots get out, now!

248
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,291
I can't believe this!

249
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,166
Put me down right now!

250
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,708
And just what the hell were you
trying to accomplish back there?

251
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,750
Robots get out, now!

252
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,583
You know, you really
should move your car

253
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:57,458
or it might get
trashed by those idiots.

254
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:00,916
So, now what's next?

255
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,625
Well, immigration seems
like a likely place.

256
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:04,750
Oh, Ross.

257
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:05,875
I already went there

258
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,708
and couldn't find
our guy on the list.

259
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,708
Hmm.

260
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,000
Oh, I doubt we'll
find any record of him,

261
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:16,041
because 37% of the population
isn't registered here.

262
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,541
Or I guess you
didn't know that.

263
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,041
So then just who the hell
were you trying to see

264
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,875
at the Conception Company?

265
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,208
That is private.

266
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,916
By the way, I've already
done some leg work.

267
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Conception was the company

268
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,958
that set the standards
for the Seconds.

269
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,208
So, there you go.

270
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,291
Ah, but you know,
I still pity 'em.

271
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,291
The other manufacturer,
Hu-Gite passed 'em up,

272
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:38,541
and it killed their aspirations,

273
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,833
but that's the way
it always goes.

274
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,583
Say, does this fancy machine
have reclining seats?

275
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,875
Huh, partner?

276
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:51,916
If you're looking for a partner,
then stop flying solo.

277
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,791
Hey Ross, as your partner,
can I make a suggestion?

278
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:00,875
Yeah.

279
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,875
Let's eat. I'm starving.

280
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,250
Alright.

281
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,666
Ice cream.

282
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,166
Junk food? I thought we were
gonna get something to eat.

283
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,041
Oh well, whatever.

284
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,208
This is some kinda town.

285
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:07,375
Things are just gonna

286
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,333
get worse with all these
remodeled Seconds.

287
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:12,458
There's no way humans and
robots are ever gonna get along.

288
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:15,125
Besides, you can't trust robots.

289
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:16,625
Oh, you're no different.

290
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:18,333
Hmm?

291
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:20,750
You and that guy
are both the same.

292
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,583
What do you mean, that nutcase?

293
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:27,333
It just seems that both of you
have something against robots.

294
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:29,625
Well, I'm sick of all
these cyborgs and humanoids

295
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,791
and machines that
only seem to copy us.

296
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,500
Since I'm allowed
to make a choice,

297
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:37,625
I choose not to like something
that pretends to be human.

298
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,875
Huh?

299
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,500
Hmph!

300
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,666
Now you're positive that
the woman on the shuttle

301
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,458
with you was Kelly McCanon?

302
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:01,666
Well?

303
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,291
Ah, of course I'm sure!

304
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:05,750
Scuse me.

305
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:09,666
Aw, please tell me you found
Kelly! Won'tcha? Huh? Huh?

306
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,041
No stinkin' robot could play

307
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:14,333
a guitar or sing the way
Kelly does! I'm her manager!

308
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:15,875
I know her better than anybody!

309
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,250
She's the most
human woman I know!

310
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,583
Armitage!

311
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:25,666
Your client is history buddy.

312
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,458
Just learn to live with it.

313
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:30,291
Hey wait!

314
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:34,416
Hey, wait up! Armitage!

315
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,291
I want to go!

316
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,333
Your conduct was
hardly professional.

317
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:42,458
Sorry, but that whiner
was nothing but an asshole.

318
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:45,416
Maybe you can sympathize
with him, but I don't!

319
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:47,958
Hmm.

320
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:49,875
That jerk can't
figure out how a robot

321
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:53,416
could possibly be as good
as his precious human star.

322
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:57,500
Don't you understand?

323
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:00,000
All of McCanon's
talents, personality,

324
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,833
and dreams were
inside that machine.

325
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:04,875
Oh my god.

326
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:06,541
Yeah, what is it?

327
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:12,916
I didn't realize.

328
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:19,541
Sylibus here.

329
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:20,791
Uh, it's Chris.

330
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:23,041
I'm receiving a weird
voicemail transmission.

331
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:24,416
Is Armitage with you?

332
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,875
Uh...

333
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,708
No, I'm afraid I don't
see her right now.

334
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:31,500
Okay, listen, it's coming
to us in real time.

335
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:33,583
So I'll transmit it
to your mailbox.

336
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,958
Log it and show it
to Armitage right away.

337
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:38,250
I told you, an officer
named Armitage!

338
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:41,166
Okay, okay, lady we're
looking for her right now.

339
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,083
Please! You've got to help me!

340
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:43,958
I'm a Third.

341
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:45,833
Right. What's your name again?

342
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:47,083
Wait a second, let me get a pen.

343
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:48,083
Alright, go ahead.

344
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:51,416
Manning. It's Jessica Manning.

345
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,333
I'm keeping a list of all
the Thirds from Pluto.

346
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:57,083
I can't go outside because
of the protests.

347
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:58,416
And the man on TV

348
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,625
who killed that singer
has been sending me mail.

349
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:03,500
Something's going to
happen unless you help me!

350
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,333
Who are you?

351
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:27,916
Huh?

352
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:32,500
Huh, why are they all females?

353
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,083
TV piracy is a felony, pal!

354
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:54,666
You could get eight years
of hard labor in prison.

355
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,583
Who the hell are you?

356
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:58,125
I'm Rene D'anclaude.

357
00:26:58,208 --> 00:26:59,083
Huh?

358
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:01,833
It's my name.

359
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:05,250
So just who do you
think you are, mister?

360
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:08,500
There are other things to
concern yourselves with.

361
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:10,250
Let me show you.

362
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:18,208
Robots are disguising
themselves as humans.

363
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:20,041
Am I wrong?

364
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:22,875
It's my duty to do
something about this.

365
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:27,041
You must be rid of
those so-called Thirds.

366
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:29,291
First contestant:

367
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:31,541
This is Jessica Manning,

368
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:32,291
Shit!

369
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:33,833
a snobbish,

370
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:37,041
bourgeois artist who lives and
works right here among you.

371
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:39,416
She had you all fooled.

372
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,750
What should we do about her?

373
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:19,458
Hey are you okay?

374
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:20,708
Where's Ms. Manning?

375
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:23,958
Oh Jessica!
Save her, please! Why...

376
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:35,291
It's all right.
You just wait here.

377
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:42,125
Robots get out now!

378
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:46,958
Let me through! Police! Hey!

379
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:48,958
Give us back our jobs!

380
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:51,041
Get out right now!

381
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:56,000
Huh?

382
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:07,583
It's them.

383
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:09,416
The list of Thirds!

384
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:17,125
Yes. And then? No, wait!

385
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:32,250
Goodbye Jessica.

386
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:25,166
Slow down!

387
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:54,291
You of all people should
understand my work.

388
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:57,916
After all, didn't a cyborg
kill your partner?

389
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,791
They're a pestilence.

390
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:06,125
Hmm?

391
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:07,583
But your leg!

392
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:16,500
Hey, sailor, what's this?

393
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:23,083
You've gotta be kidding!

394
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:24,458
A fake leg?

395
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:28,458
Surely the ironic humor of
this hasn't escaped you!

396
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:33,166
You're almost a stinking
cyborg yourself, you freak!

397
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,625
Huh?

398
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:52,083
What's that?

399
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:54,500
Huh?

400
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,666
It's you.

401
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,833
Until now, you've
never witnessed

402
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:20,416
the true power of a Third.

403
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,208
Allow me to demonstrate.

404
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:38,625
Here bitch!

405
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,875
Burn, you misfit!

406
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,916
You monster.

407
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:13,958
Yeah, that's right,

408
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:15,375
I'm a monster.

409
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:18,375
Just another name for
a Third in your book!

410
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:20,375
What're you gonna do,
destroy me?

411
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:22,916
Why, what did we
ever do to humans?

412
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,916
If humans don't want me,
then why did they create me?

413
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,416
Don't do it!

414
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,583
Just cuff him.

415
00:33:35,666 --> 00:33:38,250
You're a police officer
first, Armitage.

416
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:40,625
And you know what your duty is.

417
00:33:42,625 --> 00:33:44,916
Armitage, it doesn't matter
that you're a Third.

418
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,583
You're a cop...

419
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:48,625
and you're my partner.

420
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,291
No! Don't look at me!

421
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:20,375
You'd already figured out that
I wasn't a human, didn't you?

422
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,375
I feel like

423
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:23,666
some kind of grotesque puppet!

424
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,791
I can walk and talk.

425
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:27,291
And I can laugh.

426
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:29,583
And I can cry.

427
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:34,583
But I'm only a monstrous doll!

428
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:36,833
No!

429
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:51,291
Armitage carries a special
A Class license.

430
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:52,625
I know.

431
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:55,500
But she chose to
become a cop. A good one.

432
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:57,291
You understand what
I'm getting at?

433
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:58,625
Yeah.

434
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:02,166
The reason she disappeared
is because of you, Ross.

435
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,666
Lt. Randolph, you can
interrogate me all you want.

436
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,791
I'm used to it.

437
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:07,875
Ross, that won't be necessary.

438
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:09,500
If you say you
don't know anything,

439
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:10,625
that's good enough for me,

440
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,375
and leave it at that.

441
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:13,916
I'm no Sherlock Holmes,

442
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,166
but I've learned from experience
to follow my instinct.

443
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:20,708
I have a hunch there's some kind
of connection between Armitage

444
00:35:20,791 --> 00:35:23,166
and the killing of
the Third types.

445
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:27,000
This could get real fun.

446
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,208
If an officer is
rumored to be a humanoid,

447
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:30,750
the shit could hit the fan.

448
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:34,458
So let's keep this between you,
me, and the wall.

449
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:36,333
Armitage isn't a good cop.

450
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:37,916
She's a great one.

451
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:14,250
Always hurts like hell
when the rain comes.

452
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:16,375
Hmm?

453
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,708
Start message.

454
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:32,375
Hey, where are you?
Are you okay?

455
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:34,125
Your partner's concerned.

456
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:37,916
Lieutenant Randolph's no dummy.
He suspects you're a Third.

457
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,750
It appears D'anclaude
is working with someone,

458
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:43,500
because Thirds are
still being murdered.

459
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:46,041
Armitage, don't let
bitterness change you.

460
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:48,083
Come back. Please.

461
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:13,416
This makes number seven.

462
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,416
Oh god, I think I'm gonna puke!

463
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,416
Who the hell is doing this?

464
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,875
I can only think of two people
with the means and motivation.

465
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:22,291
Hmm?

466
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:24,583
I'm talking about
Rene D'anclaude.

467
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:25,625
And Armitage.

468
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:26,833
What's that?

469
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:29,750
Yeah, I know, it's
weird to think about,

470
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:31,625
but she talked to me
about it once.

471
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,583
She pities the robots
used for crime,

472
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:35,500
so she kills them quickly.

473
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:37,833
But I can't believe
she'd actually...

474
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,291
Not on your life.

475
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:44,333
Sure the village is artsy,
but downtown is a pit.

476
00:37:44,416 --> 00:37:45,875
I wouldn't move
there for anything.

477
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:47,916
Listen, I've gotta
get some writing done.

478
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,583
I'll talk to ya later.

479
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:57,375
Continue writing mode.
Novel in progress, untitled.

480
00:37:59,541 --> 00:38:01,875
Chapter 2, paragraph 5.

481
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:06,916
"How could she greet the ones
from the deep far away?

482
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,375
"She, who has spent a pleasant
and enchanting afternoon...

483
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:12,708
"who had never given a
thought about the person

484
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,250
from the Luluie,

485
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:18,791
the same one who had once picked
her up, now cold and dead."

486
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:20,583
"A phantom.

487
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:35,875
"Her battle with
the old gods ended.

488
00:38:35,958 --> 00:38:37,708
"As a spiritual
truce was struck,

489
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:39,708
she felt her soul unburdened.

490
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:42,708
"She smiled. Already the
feeling of harmony was-"

491
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:46,916
Who's there?

492
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,375
Who are you?

493
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:49,791
Are you Armitage?

494
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:54,708
Are you the one
who contacted me?

495
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,291
You fooled me!

496
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:15,583
I don't wanna die. I don't wa-

497
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:24,458
Do you mean that
Armitage is a suspect?

498
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:26,708
Well, you can't just
deny the evidence.

499
00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:29,000
The woman's last words
said it all.

500
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:30,416
The whole department is shocked,

501
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,083
but the lieutenant had
suspicions about her all along.

502
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:35,416
He's already issued
a warrant for her arrest,

503
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,708
and there's an APB out on her.

504
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:40,000
Why that sly old dog.

505
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:43,083
Access mail. Log file, Armitage.

506
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:44,541
Open file.

507
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:49,375
This is Pluto.

508
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:52,500
I'm sending this message
by using Armitage's ID.

509
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:54,791
I'm a Third, just like you...

510
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:59,125
Hey, Chris. Let's find out where
this mail originated from.

511
00:39:59,208 --> 00:40:00,541
You got it.

512
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:12,083
Hey Kelly, wanna see
a movie Saturday?

513
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:18,083
Hey, I was worried about you.

514
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,166
I used to love the
playground after school.

515
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,791
I was a pretty
clumsy kid, though.

516
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:24,000
I took a tumble off the
see-saw once and bawled

517
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:25,583
all the way home.

518
00:40:25,666 --> 00:40:28,750
Listen, did you know that MPD
has been searching for you?

519
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,041
But you're looking
for Pluto, right?

520
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:36,208
Let's go.

521
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:37,583
Armitage.

522
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:39,333
What?

523
00:40:39,416 --> 00:40:41,125
I believe in you.

524
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:49,916
There! That's him,
I'm sure of it.

525
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,666
Huh? But he's a boy.

526
00:40:53,875 --> 00:40:55,166
How do you do, Pluto.

527
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,625
It's nice to meet you.

528
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:58,791
Please don't call me
by my handle again.

529
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:01,458
You can use my given name,
Julian Moore.

530
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,083
I'm sorry!

531
00:41:04,166 --> 00:41:06,083
By the way,
shouldn't you be in class?

532
00:41:06,166 --> 00:41:06,916
No.

533
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,166
I'm transferring my thoughts

534
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,166
to the main memory at
the Navigation Center.

535
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,375
Hmm?

536
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:12,750
What for?

537
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:17,541
To make a backup
of myself. Obviously.

538
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:18,791
Well, let's go!

539
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:20,333
Huh? Where?

540
00:41:20,416 --> 00:41:22,625
To the memory server at
the Ad Tower, of course.

541
00:41:22,708 --> 00:41:25,541
You want to learn the purpose
of the Thirds, don't you?

542
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:27,333
I can't believe it!
You're a Third?!

543
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:28,666
Yes, I'm a Third.

544
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,375
The last one made.

545
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:32,875
What's wrong?!

546
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:34,041
Why'd the elevator stop?

547
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:35,416
I don't know.

548
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:40,041
Huh?

549
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,541
It won't stop!

550
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:52,750
We're dropping pretty fast!

551
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:55,041
At this rate,
we're gonna die for sure!

552
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,291
Ross, hold on tight to him!

553
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:01,750
Do you really think
this is gonna work?

554
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:03,208
You got any ideas?

555
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,708
Ross.

556
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:31,000
I think my right arm
and ribs are broken.

557
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:41,708
Armitage, don't get any closer!

558
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:45,500
Damn you!

559
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:50,250
He's fast!

560
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:53,125
Come on, we gotta run for it!

561
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:55,625
Go on. Leave me here.

562
00:42:55,708 --> 00:42:57,625
No! I'll help you! Let's go!

563
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,875
Oh my god!

564
00:43:35,666 --> 00:43:37,458
Looks like the only
choice is to fight!

565
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:09,291
Aim it up.

566
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:11,375
If Armitage is killed, then
there's gonna be no hope for me.

567
00:44:22,916 --> 00:44:25,833
It's D'anclaude!
I just don't believe it!

568
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:30,708
Surprise, surprise.
Hah! Didja miss me?

569
00:44:30,791 --> 00:44:32,583
You son of a bitch!

570
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,958
I won't let you
die alone, cherie.

571
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:49,458
The other two will join you.

572
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:52,000
Fucking bastard!

573
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,083
He's not human!

574
00:44:57,666 --> 00:44:59,958
Nice right hook, but now I'm
going to crush the three of you

575
00:45:00,041 --> 00:45:01,458
and get on with my life.

576
00:45:01,541 --> 00:45:04,041
I have places to go
and robots to kill.

577
00:45:06,208 --> 00:45:07,208
Huh?

578
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,041
Huh? What the-

579
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:17,541
Hi there. Bon Voyage Rene.

580
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,708
You crazy bitch! Give me the
keys! Please, unlock it!

581
00:45:22,875 --> 00:45:24,250
Bye bye!

582
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:37,500
I'm curious. Why aren't other
Thirds as strong as you?

583
00:45:37,583 --> 00:45:39,166
Security should be
here any minute.

584
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:40,333
I'm sure they'll
take care of you!

585
00:45:40,416 --> 00:45:41,416
No.

586
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,791
You don't have to
run and hide now.

587
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:46,500
Officers don't leave
their injured behind.

588
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:54,875
You're cold, lady.

589
00:46:04,583 --> 00:46:05,833
Huh?

590
00:46:09,416 --> 00:46:11,416
I will always be cold.

591
00:46:13,625 --> 00:46:15,500
Armitage.

592
00:46:25,666 --> 00:46:28,750
I'm amazed he survived with
all the injuries he sustained.

593
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:30,750
His entire chest area
was damaged,

594
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:32,500
and the right arm was severed.

595
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:34,000
Over fifty percent of his body

596
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:36,666
will be artificial
replacement parts.

597
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:39,166
Isn't that gonna be a
problem for a policeman?

598
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:40,916
Eh, for a recruit, maybe,

599
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,750
but not for this cowboy.

600
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:54,375
Pal, I sure hope you
feel better than you look.

601
00:46:54,458 --> 00:46:57,375
I can't understand why my
other arm hurts so much.

602
00:46:57,458 --> 00:47:00,125
The doctor threw in some kinda
new nervous system for ya,

603
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:02,166
so it's probably
just a side effect.

604
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:06,291
At any rate, there's
something I wanna show ya.

605
00:47:11,125 --> 00:47:12,375
It's Kelly McCanon.

606
00:47:12,458 --> 00:47:14,708
Why haven't they
disposed of her body yet?

607
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:16,541
Hey, she's a real find.

608
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,083
You don't just throw
something like her away.

609
00:47:19,166 --> 00:47:20,416
Except for a few functions,

610
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,666
Thirds are perfect
synthetic organisms.

611
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:26,708
They can simulate every physical
aspect of the human body.

612
00:47:26,791 --> 00:47:29,250
The big mystery that's had
everybody running in circles

613
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:31,416
is why all the Thirds
have been female.

614
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,625
Do you know?

615
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:37,125
After the victims
were autopsied,

616
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:38,583
we discovered that
this wasn't just

617
00:47:38,666 --> 00:47:40,750
a case of robot destruction.

618
00:47:40,833 --> 00:47:42,083
It was murder.

619
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:43,291
I'll show ya.

620
00:47:45,583 --> 00:47:47,791
Our country-western
singer, here,

621
00:47:47,875 --> 00:47:49,375
she was pregnant.

622
00:47:50,416 --> 00:47:52,250
No stinkin' robot
could play a guitar or

623
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:54,916
sing the way Kelly does!
I'm her manager!

624
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,458
I know her better than anybody!

625
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:59,208
She's the most
human woman I know!

626
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,041
I can't believe I'm
capable of giving birth.

627
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:20,791
Quite a revelation, isn't it?

628
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:22,875
That's the whole purpose
of the Third types.

629
00:48:22,958 --> 00:48:25,291
You can step beyond the
bounds of conventional robots,

630
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:27,125
just by getting pregnant,

631
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:28,791
Mommy Armitage.

632
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:31,583
Hmph.

633
00:48:31,666 --> 00:48:33,250
Not funny.

634
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:35,500
It's too weird.

635
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:39,625
But you, what's your role?

636
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,250
I'm still trying
to figure that out.

637
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:44,958
What's the point in
creating a male kid?

638
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:48,833
The CPU showed my serial
number as the last Third made.

639
00:48:50,583 --> 00:48:53,000
The final model off the line.

640
00:48:53,083 --> 00:48:54,125
Not quite.

641
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:55,666
We can breed now.

642
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:58,833
Now I understand why the Thirds
were made to seem so human,

643
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:01,416
not just in appearance,
but emotionally.

644
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,666
Like the murdered singer
and that novelist.

645
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:06,041
They weren't just machines.
They had souls.

646
00:49:06,125 --> 00:49:09,208
It takes more than the
right plumbing to procreate.

647
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:13,458
Yes, sir. The perfect
receptacle for human babies.

648
00:49:14,833 --> 00:49:16,541
What the hell is so funny, huh?

649
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,500
Jerk.

650
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:19,208
What's the matter?

651
00:49:19,291 --> 00:49:20,916
Have I touched a nerve?

652
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,750
Maternal clock ticking?

653
00:49:23,916 --> 00:49:26,958
Maybe you'd like Detective
Ross to set your alarm.

654
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,583
Shut up.

655
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:34,291
I was just kidding.

656
00:49:34,375 --> 00:49:37,250
Julian, do you know
why they made us?

657
00:49:37,333 --> 00:49:39,291
I don't.

658
00:49:39,375 --> 00:49:41,208
But I'll bet Asakura does.

659
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:44,166
Or...D'anclaude.

660
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:46,666
He must have some part in this.

661
00:49:51,791 --> 00:49:53,166
How are you feeling, Ross?

662
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:54,791
Have you made a full recovery?

663
00:49:54,875 --> 00:49:56,375
Yeah, I'm fine.

664
00:49:56,458 --> 00:49:58,625
It just takes some time getting
used to these new body parts.

665
00:49:58,708 --> 00:49:59,916
Ironic, isn't it?

666
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,958
What?

667
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:02,208
Little by little,

668
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:05,291
you're becoming like the
robots you hate so much.

669
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:07,291
Let's get down to
business, shall we?

670
00:50:07,375 --> 00:50:09,041
Why is the investigation
of the Thirds over,

671
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:10,916
that doesn't make any sense.

672
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Maybe it does.

673
00:50:12,083 --> 00:50:13,333
Bullshit.

674
00:50:13,416 --> 00:50:16,083
But we have to follow orders
in this department.

675
00:50:16,166 --> 00:50:17,666
Tell me, was the
decision forced?

676
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,291
I'll tell you what it is.

677
00:50:20,166 --> 00:50:22,791
It's a goddamned order
that you're gonna follow!

678
00:50:22,875 --> 00:50:24,500
The Third investigation is over,

679
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:27,166
because the murderer
was apprehended.

680
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,541
Even after we've discovered

681
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,875
the Thirds are robots
that can actually conceive?

682
00:50:30,958 --> 00:50:32,916
Why stop here?

683
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,916
D'anclaude's under full guard.

684
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,250
Yeah right.

685
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:39,250
He's over at Shinora General
Government Hospital.

686
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:42,666
I can't accept the contradictory
report that you filed.

687
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:44,208
But sir.

688
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:47,791
Our job is to investigate an
arrest technological criminals.

689
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:49,291
Don't forget it.

690
00:50:49,375 --> 00:50:51,291
That's all I have
to say for now.

691
00:50:56,541 --> 00:50:58,708
Ironic, isn't it?

692
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:00,083
Little by little,

693
00:51:00,166 --> 00:51:03,125
you're becoming like the
robots you hate so much.

694
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,583
That's where all my memory
was backed up and stored.

695
00:51:18,666 --> 00:51:20,333
I'm saved for posterity.

696
00:51:20,416 --> 00:51:22,083
And if we're all
murdered, you know-

697
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:23,791
Will you give it a rest!

698
00:51:37,416 --> 00:51:38,458
Bingo!

699
00:51:40,791 --> 00:51:41,500
Warning.

700
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:42,791
Only authorized personnel

701
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:45,833
are permitted within
the memory bank I/O room.

702
00:51:45,916 --> 00:51:48,666
Please vacate this area at once!

703
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:49,958
We're lost.

704
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:52,375
Which way is magnetic north?

705
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:54,208
There is no department
by that name.

706
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:56,708
You must vacate
within 10 seconds, or-

707
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:04,458
Asakura was quite a designer.

708
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:07,083
He created the ultimate
woman who could kick ass

709
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:09,291
and raise children!

710
00:52:09,375 --> 00:52:10,875
He designed you, too.

711
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:14,708
Yeah, but I can't get pregnant.

712
00:52:22,125 --> 00:52:23,125
That's it.

713
00:52:33,916 --> 00:52:36,708
Here goes! I hate that
this is the easiest way.

714
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:43,291
Hey, will you hurry up?

715
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:46,833
Hey, I'm doing this for you,
it hurts like Hell, so shut up!

716
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:50,041
I need to know about myself.

717
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,958
Who am I and why.

718
00:52:54,416 --> 00:52:55,666
I'll look.

719
00:52:59,583 --> 00:53:01,625
I'm searching
for Asakura's file.

720
00:53:05,041 --> 00:53:07,250
Armitage...

721
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:08,875
Help me out!

722
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:10,750
My virtual monitor.

723
00:53:10,833 --> 00:53:11,791
Yeah?

724
00:53:11,875 --> 00:53:13,750
Open it from my
navigational system.

725
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:18,750
Good, I've located
the still image file.

726
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:20,666
Hold on, just another second.

727
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:32,083
That's my father!

728
00:53:32,166 --> 00:53:34,583
But why is he standing
next to D'anclaude?

729
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:38,833
I don't believe it.

730
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:44,750
Julian!

731
00:53:44,833 --> 00:53:47,916
Damn it! I think
someone's discovered me.

732
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,333
We're logging off now!

733
00:53:54,833 --> 00:53:57,916
Oh, god! Something's in me!

734
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:01,916
Please help me!

735
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:12,333
Little Naomi Armitage.

736
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:15,458
Went looking for knowledge
and only found trouble.

737
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:18,291
You can't stop the Third types
from being killed, my dear.

738
00:54:28,791 --> 00:54:32,500
Shoot me. I don't mind.

739
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:35,875
Pull the trigger, I dare you!

740
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:41,583
So, you're not a human.

741
00:54:41,666 --> 00:54:44,208
Are you a Third type?

742
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:45,500
You won't find my name

743
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:48,250
in the membership of
that club for failures.

744
00:54:48,333 --> 00:54:50,166
What are you saying?

745
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:51,833
You make me retch.

746
00:54:51,916 --> 00:54:54,166
Cheap imitations
pretending to be human.

747
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:56,166
There's no comparison
to our superiority.

748
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:59,958
I couldn't agree with
humans more on one thing:

749
00:55:00,041 --> 00:55:02,833
all Thirds should
be annihilated.

750
00:55:07,708 --> 00:55:08,916
I'll kill you!

751
00:55:22,958 --> 00:55:26,875
Julian! No!

752
00:55:26,958 --> 00:55:28,708
That bastard's
not the original.

753
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:30,083
Oh my god!

754
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,041
What's wrong?!

755
00:55:32,125 --> 00:55:33,166
I'm going.

756
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:35,166
I'll finally meet
the real D'anclaude.

757
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:36,625
Get back!

758
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:46,916
Armitage...

759
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,500
Goodbye.

760
00:55:48,583 --> 00:55:51,416
Oh, no, Julian, no!

761
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,791
Ross, it-

762
00:56:00,875 --> 00:56:01,958
Huh?

763
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:03,583
Ross.

764
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:04,833
No.

765
00:56:05,583 --> 00:56:06,833
Ross, I need your help.

766
00:56:06,916 --> 00:56:08,666
Ross, it's D'anclaude, again.

767
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:10,000
I need you.

768
00:56:10,083 --> 00:56:12,750
Julian. I need you.

769
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:19,166
So one of my men got
a little carried away.

770
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,625
Hmm, well.

771
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:23,458
I'm Judicial
Vice Minister, Jusup,

772
00:56:23,541 --> 00:56:25,416
and I'm visiting as

773
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,625
a representative of the
Legal Affairs Bureau.

774
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:31,125
I need an accurate picture
of the MPD's operations.

775
00:56:31,208 --> 00:56:33,875
I'm just a bit confused.

776
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:35,541
Help me to understand why

777
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:37,083
an inspector from
Earth's government

778
00:56:37,166 --> 00:56:39,458
has come here.

779
00:56:39,541 --> 00:56:40,916
Oh, don't mind me, Lieutenant.

780
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,416
I'm simply an observer
for Mr. Jusup.

781
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,041
Think of me merely as
a fly on the wall.

782
00:56:46,125 --> 00:56:47,583
Hmm.

783
00:56:49,208 --> 00:56:51,375
Well, since you're observing,
I'm sure you have noticed

784
00:56:51,458 --> 00:56:53,458
that the robots here
on Mars don't quite

785
00:56:53,541 --> 00:56:56,291
reflect a feminist society.

786
00:56:56,375 --> 00:57:00,708
Very well. You understand
us, uh, Mr. uh...

787
00:57:00,791 --> 00:57:02,041
Randolph.

788
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:04,166
Let's call it a day
and have lunch.

789
00:57:53,916 --> 00:57:56,125
I'm sick of the
whole damn system.

790
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:02,083
Armitage...

791
00:58:04,416 --> 00:58:05,500
Didn't Julian say that

792
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:08,708
he had his memory backup
stored somewhere?

793
00:58:08,791 --> 00:58:10,333
The backup?

794
00:58:10,416 --> 00:58:11,333
That's right.

795
00:58:11,416 --> 00:58:13,000
If we can somehow
access his data,

796
00:58:13,083 --> 00:58:14,958
we could still bring him back.

797
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:16,166
Get it?

798
00:58:18,375 --> 00:58:21,166
His body's gone,
but his mind's alive.

799
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:29,250
Funny, I didn't think
I would miss him so much.

800
00:58:29,333 --> 00:58:33,500
Maybe his information will help
us and avenge his death as well.

801
00:58:33,583 --> 00:58:37,083
Julian said he was gonna
meet the real D'anclaude.

802
00:58:37,166 --> 00:58:39,625
Maybe he was telling us
we could do the same.

803
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:44,208
Ross?

804
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:45,916
Shinora, right?

805
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,541
Will you come with me?

806
00:58:54,208 --> 00:58:55,000
What's up?

807
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:57,083
The internal troops are active.

808
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:57,875
Are we at war?

809
00:58:57,958 --> 00:58:59,500
No. They're guarding.

810
00:58:59,583 --> 00:59:00,833
What, the President?

811
00:59:00,916 --> 00:59:02,958
No, Shinora Hospital.

812
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:04,541
Shinora?

813
00:59:11,708 --> 00:59:14,166
Jesus H. Christ, will you
look at that arsenal!

814
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,041
What the hell are
they doin' there?

815
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:17,958
Hold on a minute.

816
00:59:18,041 --> 00:59:19,166
I'm picking up something.

817
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:20,333
What is it?

818
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:22,500
Aw, it's just a car.

819
00:59:32,708 --> 00:59:34,333
Holy shit!

820
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:47,750
They've lost it.

821
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:50,875
Fire!

822
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:40,583
Here.

823
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:55,166
It's him.

824
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:58,416
Finally, the real D'anclaude.

825
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,416
Or I should say
Dr. René D'anclaude.

826
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:10,916
You must be...

827
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,666
Asakura's daughter,

828
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:14,250
the failure.

829
01:01:18,916 --> 01:01:21,416
We gotta hurry! Come on!

830
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,500
Let's go, while we still can.

831
01:01:26,375 --> 01:01:27,833
What's the matter?

832
01:01:29,625 --> 01:01:34,583
Ross, something's coming.

833
01:01:34,666 --> 01:01:36,125
What is it?

834
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,166
Not again.

835
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:51,208
D'anclaude! There's no way!

836
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:55,250
Hey, let's rumba!

837
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:03,916
Over here!

838
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:11,083
This way, hurry!

839
01:02:14,916 --> 01:02:17,166
Wait, don't run off!

840
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:19,583
I wanna play with you.

841
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,750
Come on! Wait!

842
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:33,208
There's no way that damn
gargoyle is a Third type!

843
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:35,916
Hmm. My, look who's talking.

844
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,333
Don't tell me you have no
clue who your brother was.

845
01:02:39,416 --> 01:02:41,666
You have more in common
with that prototype gargoyle

846
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:42,958
than you might realize.

847
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:45,416
Did you truly believe
you were a Third?

848
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,333
Liar!

849
01:02:46,416 --> 01:02:48,083
You could always ask Asakura,

850
01:02:48,166 --> 01:02:51,833
but he's tucked away safely
in a dome on Dunwitch Hill.

851
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:55,666
Armitage, don't stop.

852
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:57,250
No!

853
01:02:57,333 --> 01:03:00,541
Oh no, I can always tell when
you're gonna do something crazy.

854
01:03:04,083 --> 01:03:06,000
Hi kids.

855
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:08,416
Oh, does she want a showdown?

856
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:11,375
We're both gonna bite it.
That'll make everyone happy,

857
01:03:11,458 --> 01:03:14,916
cause you know, nobody
on Mars wants us here.

858
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,083
Wrong! You're the
one who's through!

859
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:19,208
No!

860
01:03:32,666 --> 01:03:34,125
No!

861
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:49,750
Human suffering is such
a unique privilege, isn't it?

862
01:03:49,833 --> 01:03:51,208
He's pure data.

863
01:03:51,291 --> 01:03:52,583
Cease function!

864
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:03,250
Next in the news, the
Martian Police Department

865
01:04:03,333 --> 01:04:04,958
is investigating
the terrorist attack

866
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:07,125
at Shinora General
Government Hospital,

867
01:04:07,208 --> 01:04:09,791
which occurred during an
antirobot demonstration.

868
01:04:09,875 --> 01:04:11,458
The police are asking
for our viewers' help

869
01:04:11,541 --> 01:04:13,500
in locating these two suspects:

870
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,791
Ross Sylibus and Naomi Armitage.

871
01:04:15,875 --> 01:04:18,333
The MPD confirms there is
a definite connection.

872
01:04:18,416 --> 01:04:21,791
If you have any information,
please notify the police.

873
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:39,083
Let me pick out our next
meeting place, okay?

874
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:41,333
Tables, with umbrellas.
If that makes you too sick,

875
01:04:41,416 --> 01:04:43,666
I know a vending machine
and a clean bench.

876
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:45,791
I guess maybe this
is the worst place.

877
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:48,916
The worst place?
Only if I was in your shoes.

878
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,625
Will you cut the crap!
Did you find anything?

879
01:04:51,708 --> 01:04:55,666
Yeah, your Dunwitch Hill
exists, but not on any map.

880
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:58,166
Found a good highway going
smack blank into a mountain,

881
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:00,458
but there's no Asakura
address box inviting

882
01:05:00,541 --> 01:05:03,166
any mail from a rogue cop.

883
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:05,250
No sati-topographicals?

884
01:05:05,333 --> 01:05:06,750
C'mon!

885
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:10,625
Like I really got a couple of
moons to power this thing.

886
01:05:10,708 --> 01:05:11,791
Hey, what're you doin'?

887
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:13,458
A loss on duty.

888
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:15,500
Yeah, the dearly departed.

889
01:05:17,541 --> 01:05:19,000
Hey, Ross!

890
01:05:20,916 --> 01:05:22,625
Can you tell those guys...

891
01:05:22,708 --> 01:05:25,375
the Martians, tell 'em
Eddie says "What's up?"

892
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:26,916
Sure.

893
01:05:30,125 --> 01:05:32,041
So, what's wrong?

894
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:37,750
Well, are you gonna tell me?

895
01:05:43,625 --> 01:05:44,958
Are you O.K.?

896
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:48,708
No, I'm not.
My CPU's all messed up.

897
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:51,458
They say the mind's
the first thing to go.

898
01:05:51,541 --> 01:05:52,708
Humans say it.

899
01:05:52,791 --> 01:05:55,333
Come on, Armitage,
machines don't go senile.

900
01:05:55,416 --> 01:05:58,250
They also say life
is pretty short.

901
01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:00,666
It's like an expiration date,
you know?

902
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,666
Hey, how come?

903
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:06,041
What?

904
01:06:06,125 --> 01:06:08,416
What's the reason you're
doing all this for me, huh?

905
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:11,833
So tell me how come
you're still with me,

906
01:06:11,916 --> 01:06:14,125
and driving me all
the way out here anyway?

907
01:06:14,208 --> 01:06:16,958
I mean, why change from
a good cop to a criminal?

908
01:06:19,791 --> 01:06:21,208
How come-

909
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:25,291
Stop! You're asking stupid
questions like some little kid.

910
01:06:25,375 --> 01:06:27,958
Why? How come?

911
01:06:28,041 --> 01:06:29,250
There's no answer.

912
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,458
That's it, isn't it?

913
01:06:45,541 --> 01:06:47,208
Coordinates.

914
01:06:50,666 --> 01:06:54,291
Virgin? Yeah, maybe if
you just landed here.

915
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:59,291
Hey, it wastes fuel
to keep the motor running.

916
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:27,291
Yo, anybody here?

917
01:07:30,458 --> 01:07:33,625
We're looking for
a guy called Asakura.

918
01:07:33,708 --> 01:07:37,291
Is anyone here?
You got visitors!

919
01:07:42,666 --> 01:07:44,416
What happened?

920
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:47,916
Alright, take it easy.
Move away from it nice and slow.

921
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:48,958
Don't shoot!

922
01:07:49,041 --> 01:07:50,458
It's only a robot.

923
01:07:50,541 --> 01:07:52,500
Yeah, a big one.

924
01:07:52,583 --> 01:07:56,291
It's somehow just like me.
I think it's a bioroid type.

925
01:07:56,375 --> 01:07:59,125
What the hell is it,
some kind of a prototype?

926
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:00,125
May I help you?

927
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:01,208
Huh?

928
01:08:09,708 --> 01:08:12,041
Talk about your family trees.

929
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:13,833
It's another D'anclaude.

930
01:08:13,916 --> 01:08:15,750
That same face and voice.

931
01:08:15,833 --> 01:08:19,625
I heard someone calling
for Dr. Asakura.

932
01:08:19,708 --> 01:08:20,875
I did.

933
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:25,541
Appointment?

934
01:08:25,625 --> 01:08:27,583
No, I suppose not.

935
01:08:27,666 --> 01:08:29,666
Would you follow me, please?

936
01:08:32,583 --> 01:08:36,000
Dr. Asakura, visitors! A Mr...

937
01:08:36,083 --> 01:08:38,000
Sylibus.

938
01:08:38,083 --> 01:08:39,333
Papa!

939
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:44,833
The new man from Conception!
It's been so many years,

940
01:08:44,916 --> 01:08:48,250
and you even brought one
of the models along.

941
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:49,541
Mr. Sylibus.

942
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:50,791
Uh, but I'm not-

943
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:52,208
Papa!

944
01:08:55,041 --> 01:08:57,625
Oh, but she's only a Third.

945
01:08:57,708 --> 01:08:59,916
She's so inferior.

946
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,125
The poor little thing,
but you needn't be so kind.

947
01:09:03,208 --> 01:09:04,875
It's outdated.

948
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:08,458
Oh, I'm sorry. Here,
take a look at this.

949
01:09:09,666 --> 01:09:13,208
A fourth type that
Conception can be proud of.

950
01:09:13,291 --> 01:09:17,750
There's no longer any need to
copy humans or plants anymore.

951
01:09:17,833 --> 01:09:21,041
They live. They're ALIVEs!

952
01:09:21,125 --> 01:09:23,375
Oh, no, we should
call them "phobians."

953
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:27,791
What? Yes, a new life, my
Marforteans, but you won't.

954
01:09:27,875 --> 01:09:30,041
You'll just be calling
them anything you want

955
01:09:30,125 --> 01:09:31,708
when you market them.

956
01:09:31,791 --> 01:09:34,416
The stupid company you work
for is just going to call them

957
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,250
the Fourths aren't they?

958
01:09:36,333 --> 01:09:39,083
They're ALIVEs!
A grand conception!

959
01:09:39,166 --> 01:09:40,791
Then it all goes wrong.

960
01:09:42,958 --> 01:09:45,541
The doctor's mind was
unfortunately altered.

961
01:09:45,625 --> 01:09:48,750
Reduplication of his
thoughts is very difficult.

962
01:09:48,833 --> 01:09:50,208
Please, be patient.

963
01:09:50,291 --> 01:09:53,291
His memory, was it erased?

964
01:09:53,375 --> 01:09:54,625
Who are you?

965
01:09:54,708 --> 01:10:00,041
I am Wilbur D'anclaude
and Dr. Asakura's aide.

966
01:10:00,125 --> 01:10:01,458
Oh, well yeah he might look

967
01:10:01,541 --> 01:10:05,041
to you like he's one
of those damn assassinroids,

968
01:10:05,125 --> 01:10:07,291
but I fixed up his crazy head,

969
01:10:07,375 --> 01:10:09,166
just as you can see.

970
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:11,375
Indeed he did.

971
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:15,166
The violent tendencies I had are
now gone, due to the upgrade.

972
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:16,708
What's the reason?

973
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:18,041
Pardon?

974
01:10:18,125 --> 01:10:21,375
Dr. Asakura. His mind,
just what's wrong with it?

975
01:10:21,458 --> 01:10:22,750
Forget it, Ross.

976
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:26,583
That's enough.

977
01:10:35,875 --> 01:10:37,875
Are you still cold?

978
01:10:37,958 --> 01:10:40,375
Yes, it's affecting
my nervous system.

979
01:10:40,458 --> 01:10:44,416
I'm sorry I lost my temper,
I was just hoping the doctor

980
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:47,625
would be able
to help you somehow.

981
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:51,083
Never count on hope.
You'll lose.

982
01:10:51,166 --> 01:10:55,250
When wishes are gone,
hope gives nothing.

983
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:58,625
And then you hope that
your father might know.

984
01:10:58,708 --> 01:11:00,875
And hopes are really fragile.

985
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:03,791
They get all ruined,

986
01:11:03,875 --> 01:11:07,125
every time you believe
that somebody else is gonna

987
01:11:07,208 --> 01:11:08,875
help your hopes come true.

988
01:11:13,208 --> 01:11:17,333
A hope is a feeling.
Maybe you'll be okay.

989
01:11:17,416 --> 01:11:20,833
If I was a Second,
then I wouldn't even be able

990
01:11:20,916 --> 01:11:24,916
to think of all
this stupid crap.

991
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,208
But I'm programmed
to be a human,

992
01:11:27,291 --> 01:11:30,250
and I don't even know
what that means.

993
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:32,833
Hope is a human feeling,
isn't it, Ross?

994
01:11:32,916 --> 01:11:33,708
Come on, tell me more-

995
01:11:33,791 --> 01:11:36,166
Hey, I know one.

996
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:39,583
He's a human,
and he's less real

997
01:11:39,666 --> 01:11:42,541
than all of the things
you're talking about.

998
01:11:42,625 --> 01:11:44,375
You wanna know what he said?

999
01:11:44,458 --> 01:11:46,208
"Don't give up."

1000
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:50,583
Ross.

1001
01:12:00,625 --> 01:12:01,791
Are you sure?

1002
01:12:01,875 --> 01:12:03,583
Armitage, I think it's
the only thing I've been

1003
01:12:03,666 --> 01:12:05,708
sure of since I got here.

1004
01:12:05,791 --> 01:12:07,250
How 'bout you?

1005
01:12:10,458 --> 01:12:13,000
Well, at least something
is normal here on Mars.

1006
01:12:19,125 --> 01:12:20,625
But I'm not normal.

1007
01:12:20,708 --> 01:12:21,875
I'm a robot.

1008
01:12:21,958 --> 01:12:24,000
I'm half robot too.

1009
01:12:24,083 --> 01:12:26,708
But I know a true heart
when I've met one.

1010
01:12:29,375 --> 01:12:32,416
We interrupt this broadcast
for the following announcement.

1011
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:33,916
Good evening,

1012
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,375
we've just received word that
as of 11:00 PM, UTN time,

1013
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:38,666
the economic agreement
has been signed at last.

1014
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:40,958
Mars and Earth have
finally signed the treaty.

1015
01:12:41,041 --> 01:12:43,291
Officials from both powers
are quoted as saying,

1016
01:12:43,375 --> 01:12:46,791
"This is a first step toward
one world, one nation."

1017
01:13:00,166 --> 01:13:02,791
Follow me, there's something
I'd like to show you.

1018
01:13:05,708 --> 01:13:06,791
Where's the doc?

1019
01:13:06,875 --> 01:13:09,125
This morning,
he's with his ALIVEs.

1020
01:13:09,208 --> 01:13:12,083
He's concentrating on
further hybridization.

1021
01:13:12,166 --> 01:13:14,416
He intends to
continue and complete

1022
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:17,250
the initial terraforming plans.

1023
01:13:17,333 --> 01:13:18,750
But that's impossible.

1024
01:13:18,833 --> 01:13:21,750
Yes, rational thought
would agree.

1025
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:30,875
Don't worry. The unborn
sister poses no threat.

1026
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:33,458
Dr. Asakura gave up
weapon production.

1027
01:13:33,541 --> 01:13:36,500
He left this new model
unfinished. But why?

1028
01:13:36,583 --> 01:13:39,666
A difference of opinion with his
partner Professor D'anclaude?

1029
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:41,916
I... that's enough.

1030
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,125
Let's go.

1031
01:13:44,208 --> 01:13:46,333
Is there something else?

1032
01:13:46,416 --> 01:13:49,166
I brought you here, because I
felt you had previous knowledge

1033
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:52,333
of the Thirds being
created as assassinroids.

1034
01:13:52,416 --> 01:13:54,375
Nice, upgrade. Go on.

1035
01:13:54,458 --> 01:13:56,333
It's the unfinished work.

1036
01:13:56,416 --> 01:13:59,750
Professor D'anclaude began
work on female assassinroids,

1037
01:13:59,833 --> 01:14:03,583
which would some way compliment
the multitude of my brothers.

1038
01:14:03,666 --> 01:14:05,708
Along with myself and Armitage,

1039
01:14:05,791 --> 01:14:08,333
we were the pinnacle
of robotic creation.

1040
01:14:08,416 --> 01:14:11,541
Although our strength and
abilities far surpassed humans,

1041
01:14:11,625 --> 01:14:12,750
it was quite simple

1042
01:14:12,833 --> 01:14:15,291
to assimilate ourselves
into their society.

1043
01:14:15,375 --> 01:14:19,333
Then, Dr. Asakura used us as
a base of synthetic organisms

1044
01:14:19,416 --> 01:14:21,000
in developing the Thirds.

1045
01:14:21,083 --> 01:14:24,666
Programming creativity and life
instead of the directive

1046
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:26,083
to destroy.

1047
01:14:26,166 --> 01:14:29,083
Unfortunately, all the
prototypes had an imperfection.

1048
01:14:29,166 --> 01:14:31,458
There were many instabilities
within the logic boards

1049
01:14:31,541 --> 01:14:33,708
of the Third CPU.

1050
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:36,875
Of course, Dr. Asakura's present
state of mind prevented him

1051
01:14:36,958 --> 01:14:39,916
from ever quite perfecting
the female models.

1052
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,708
I'm nothing.

1053
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:45,083
He couldn't finish. I'm useless!
He doesn't even care!

1054
01:14:45,166 --> 01:14:46,666
No, wait!

1055
01:14:48,583 --> 01:14:51,416
I don't understand.
Why even create a Third type?

1056
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:54,625
I mean, the Seconds were
good enough, even on Earth.

1057
01:14:54,708 --> 01:14:57,166
Perhaps being from Earth,
you do not have the knowledge

1058
01:14:57,250 --> 01:15:00,166
of the difficulties there are
with low Martian birthrates.

1059
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:02,541
No. I've heard.

1060
01:15:02,625 --> 01:15:04,166
What's it mean?

1061
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,375
Any colony desiring
independence,

1062
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:08,375
requires a populace.

1063
01:15:08,458 --> 01:15:12,166
Otherwise, they can't
develop a new identity.

1064
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:15,083
And Mars will continue
to be weak, as long as it

1065
01:15:15,166 --> 01:15:18,375
remains dependent upon the
Earth for its immigration.

1066
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:20,250
Well, what about Conception?

1067
01:15:20,333 --> 01:15:22,000
There's got to be more
behind it than just

1068
01:15:22,083 --> 01:15:23,958
the money that's
involved, right?

1069
01:15:24,041 --> 01:15:27,041
Indeed, manufacturers of
Thirds, which can give birth,

1070
01:15:27,125 --> 01:15:28,666
gain strength through numbers.

1071
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,208
The more people they represent,

1072
01:15:30,291 --> 01:15:32,125
the stronger their
position grows.

1073
01:15:32,208 --> 01:15:36,583
Logical. But then the
assassinations make no sense.

1074
01:15:36,666 --> 01:15:39,500
They do. If you're the
government and hope to sign

1075
01:15:39,583 --> 01:15:41,458
a treaty with the
Earth Federation.

1076
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:52,875
Nah, they couldn't.

1077
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:54,791
Do you think they've
really done it?

1078
01:15:54,875 --> 01:15:56,875
Mars has no other recourse.

1079
01:15:56,958 --> 01:15:59,875
The Earth Federation
is now strongly feminist.

1080
01:15:59,958 --> 01:16:02,750
A robot who can conceive,
contradicts the basis of

1081
01:16:02,833 --> 01:16:05,458
the Terran Party's position
of basic humanity.

1082
01:16:05,541 --> 01:16:09,583
For Mars to agree, Mars
must eliminate the Thirds.

1083
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:12,166
They are now an obstruction.

1084
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:13,583
Is that what you think?

1085
01:16:13,666 --> 01:16:16,166
That I'm just old Martian
garbage to be thrown out?

1086
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:17,875
You're wrong.

1087
01:16:17,958 --> 01:16:19,458
I'm gonna stay alive
for as long I can-

1088
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:22,458
Exactly, your programming
for self-preservation

1089
01:16:22,541 --> 01:16:26,750
is exactly equal to ours
for eliminating your kind.

1090
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:28,791
But I am now refined.

1091
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:33,041
Unlike my brothers, I respect
your wish for continued life.

1092
01:16:36,166 --> 01:16:36,958
Heya Eddie.

1093
01:16:37,041 --> 01:16:38,208
He's on suspension...

1094
01:16:38,291 --> 01:16:39,250
Huh?

1095
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:42,291
for aiding a fugitive,
section 10.

1096
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:45,166
No sir, not if
I forced him into it.

1097
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:46,916
Perhaps he'll be pardoned.

1098
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,750
I'll submit it.

1099
01:16:49,833 --> 01:16:51,875
This Dunwitch Hill Dome

1100
01:16:51,958 --> 01:16:55,166
has become a military
attack point.

1101
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:57,916
The government has made its own
connections between you two

1102
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,666
and the terrorist
attack at Shinora.

1103
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:03,208
This is an official notice.

1104
01:17:03,291 --> 01:17:04,916
You're a threat
to the government,

1105
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,458
the MPD officially denounces
all of your activities.

1106
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:10,166
So Eddie freakin' squealed.

1107
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:13,625
He didn't. How could an officer
who I put on suspension

1108
01:17:13,708 --> 01:17:15,166
say anything at all?

1109
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:16,583
Thanks a lot!

1110
01:17:16,666 --> 01:17:18,250
Sorry.

1111
01:17:19,583 --> 01:17:21,583
Sorries aren't good enough!

1112
01:17:21,666 --> 01:17:23,208
And just what the hell
are we gonna do now?

1113
01:17:23,291 --> 01:17:24,208
Survival!

1114
01:17:24,291 --> 01:17:26,333
It's basic training.

1115
01:17:26,416 --> 01:17:31,833
Lieutenant Randolph
and friends, signing off.

1116
01:17:33,416 --> 01:17:34,750
Great.

1117
01:17:34,833 --> 01:17:37,083
You're in charge. What now?

1118
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:40,333
We gotta get my father out.

1119
01:17:40,416 --> 01:17:43,750
Good morning! And this morning
is our day of new hope.

1120
01:17:43,833 --> 01:17:45,166
Our planet,

1121
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:47,000
often beleaguered with
nightmarish social confusion,

1122
01:17:47,083 --> 01:17:49,041
has been finally
pieced together again,

1123
01:17:49,125 --> 01:17:51,375
with the help from
our true home world.

1124
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:54,583
Federation Chairwoman
Everheart has taken two planets

1125
01:17:54,666 --> 01:17:57,750
and given us one world,
one nation.

1126
01:17:57,833 --> 01:18:01,458
Today we are reborn as
a unified humanity.

1127
01:18:03,666 --> 01:18:05,416
Listen to me, they're going
to blow all of us up!

1128
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:06,875
Straight to hell!

1129
01:18:06,958 --> 01:18:09,958
My ALIVEs are not yet
ready to leave.

1130
01:18:10,041 --> 01:18:12,458
They're gonna be your tender
logs in a few seconds.

1131
01:18:12,541 --> 01:18:14,041
Papa!

1132
01:18:14,125 --> 01:18:17,041
Wilbur, get the important work
into the old storage backups.

1133
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:18,916
Don't worry about me,
I'll be safe.

1134
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:19,958
It's you I'm-

1135
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,750
Maybe you are a nut,
but I'm your damn daughter,

1136
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:26,958
and you know it.

1137
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:33,958
This is a police order.

1138
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:35,958
Evacuate.

1139
01:18:40,708 --> 01:18:44,958
You're still a little fireball,
aren't you, my Naomi?

1140
01:18:47,541 --> 01:18:48,666
Papa!

1141
01:18:54,708 --> 01:18:56,208
Armitage!

1142
01:18:56,291 --> 01:18:59,625
She's alright. You must think
I'm a great coward, Mr. Sylibus.

1143
01:18:59,708 --> 01:19:01,833
But if the ALIVEs
and myself are to die,

1144
01:19:01,916 --> 01:19:03,833
I must at least save one thing.

1145
01:19:05,458 --> 01:19:07,000
Poor child.

1146
01:19:09,291 --> 01:19:13,375
Daddy will fix it.
Daddy will fix his little girl.

1147
01:19:17,041 --> 01:19:20,541
There, it's finished, Naomi.
Now you are real.

1148
01:19:37,333 --> 01:19:39,375
Last night's slogan of
"one world, one nation"

1149
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:42,166
has this morning blossomed into
a new Martian thought toward

1150
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:44,041
"two worlds, one humanity."

1151
01:20:20,208 --> 01:20:22,875
Hey listen, I think that Eddie
knows a guy that can hide us

1152
01:20:22,958 --> 01:20:25,250
as cargo on an Earth shuttle.

1153
01:20:25,333 --> 01:20:28,333
I still got friends
who can get you a new I.D.

1154
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:30,041
I don't want that.

1155
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:33,291
I'm going back.
Back to St. Lowel.

1156
01:20:43,625 --> 01:20:45,625
I don't want to see you die.

1157
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:48,083
You won't have to.

1158
01:20:48,166 --> 01:20:50,625
We'll say goodbye here.

1159
01:20:50,708 --> 01:20:52,750
I think that's a great idea,
don't you?

1160
01:20:52,833 --> 01:20:54,083
It's a pretty place,

1161
01:20:54,166 --> 01:20:56,333
if you just ignore the
smell from all the bombs.

1162
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:57,708
Armitage,

1163
01:20:57,791 --> 01:20:59,791
you know I hate it when you
talk like shit that way!

1164
01:21:01,666 --> 01:21:03,500
So what?

1165
01:21:03,583 --> 01:21:04,916
The whole planet
hates your kind,

1166
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,583
without any damn reason at all.

1167
01:21:07,666 --> 01:21:09,208
Just like I did.

1168
01:21:09,291 --> 01:21:13,041
I know they do, but if...

1169
01:21:13,125 --> 01:21:14,625
there's someone else.

1170
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:21,500
Oh, Ross, I love you
so very much!

1171
01:21:29,208 --> 01:21:31,291
Hey, go wherever you want,

1172
01:21:31,375 --> 01:21:33,583
but you're never
gonna lose me now.

1173
01:21:48,708 --> 01:21:51,500
Thank you for coming, sir.

1174
01:21:51,583 --> 01:21:53,916
This is an MFN
special news break.

1175
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,083
Chairwoman Everheart's
car has just turned onto

1176
01:21:56,166 --> 01:21:58,500
the main thoroughfare
in downtown St. Lowel.

1177
01:21:58,583 --> 01:22:01,250
Her bright smile of success is
met with the cheers of literally

1178
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:03,875
thousands of admirers
lining the streets.

1179
01:22:03,958 --> 01:22:06,583
The humanity of Mars
is now whole again.

1180
01:22:06,666 --> 01:22:08,750
One world, one nation.

1181
01:22:08,833 --> 01:22:11,000
One world, one nation.

1182
01:22:44,541 --> 01:22:45,875
Two thousand.

1183
01:22:59,458 --> 01:23:00,750
Look what Dad gave me!

1184
01:23:00,833 --> 01:23:02,458
What?

1185
01:23:02,541 --> 01:23:05,166
It's a little too
angelic for my taste,

1186
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:08,083
but now I've got
some real power.

1187
01:23:08,166 --> 01:23:09,583
We'll need it.

1188
01:23:11,291 --> 01:23:12,500
Let's show 'em.

1189
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,541
Look at all the space
we've got out here.

1190
01:26:38,625 --> 01:26:42,666
Room as far as the eye can see.

1191
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:45,666
I grew up in a small house,

1192
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:49,250
which was hard with a lot
of brothers and sisters.

1193
01:26:49,333 --> 01:26:51,583
It was always a battle
to find some small corner

1194
01:26:51,666 --> 01:26:53,750
to call your own.

1195
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:55,250
When I became a man,

1196
01:26:55,333 --> 01:26:58,083
I thought I'd live in some
wide open place like Arizona.

1197
01:26:58,166 --> 01:27:01,083
But as I grew older, I realized
that I belonged in the city,

1198
01:27:01,166 --> 01:27:03,625
surrounded by the buildings
and the bustle of people,

1199
01:27:03,708 --> 01:27:07,583
a place like this is
too spacious for my taste.

1200
01:27:07,666 --> 01:27:09,208
So long as I've got
the right partner,

1201
01:27:09,291 --> 01:27:10,916
that's where I'll make my home.

1202
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,458
And I won't care
who my neighbors are,

1203
01:27:12,541 --> 01:27:14,791
whether they're
Martians or robots.

1204
01:27:14,875 --> 01:27:17,166
A place we can
claim for our own.

1205
01:27:22,791 --> 01:27:26,458
Do you suppose
there is such a place?

1206
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:28,083
If we can't find it,
then by god,

1207
01:27:28,166 --> 01:27:30,875
we'll create a place
just for the two of us.

1208
01:27:32,708 --> 01:27:34,833
Do you think there's
room for three?

1209
01:27:36,833 --> 01:27:38,833
You're kidding.

1210
01:27:38,916 --> 01:27:41,166
Well, when that happens,

1211
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:43,458
I guess I'll just have
to think of something.
