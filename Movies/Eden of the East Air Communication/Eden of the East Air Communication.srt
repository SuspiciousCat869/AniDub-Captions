1
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:04,958
Johnny?

2
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,333
What are you doing?

3
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:22,583
Sto-o-o-o-o-o-p!

4
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,916
Takizawa? What's wrong?

5
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:45,791
I swear, I am seriously gonna
punch that guy out.

6
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:51,458
Anything else you need, sir?

7
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:22,625
Y'know, I don't think putting on
that t-shirt was the best idea.

8
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,958
Nah, it's okay.

9
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,750
I think I get why Seleção
number two wanted me

10
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,125
to wear it.

11
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,041
I don't think that it
can actually hurt anything.

12
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:50,000
You must be. Akira
Iinuma, I take it?

13
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,833
Yeah, that's right.

14
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,375
My name is Chigusa Iinuma.

15
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:05,333
I am Seijiro Iinuma's wife.

16
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,083
Now tell me. Who are you?

17
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,041
And what did you have to do
with this "incident" yesterday?

18
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,791
The "incident"?

19
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,375
Oh right, the missiles.

20
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,291
I think I was supposed
to be one of the targets.

21
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,833
I see.

22
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:48,166
So, you freely admit that you're
aligned with the terrorists.

23
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,541
The government already
released the details

24
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,250
of last night's events.

25
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,208
They claim it was a
preemptive strike against

26
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:58,333
the terrorists behind
Careless Monday.

27
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,583
Huh?

28
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,750
But what would make them
say something like that?

29
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:05,083
Was that part of Mononobe's
request, too? Really?

30
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,416
No matter.

31
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,416
What's clear enough is
that someone like you

32
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,583
is not even worthy to speak
the name Seijiro Iinuma.

33
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,500
He was a great man.

34
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,958
While others were content
to let Japan crumble,

35
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,625
he spent his last ounce
of strength trying

36
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:19,875
to make it whole...

37
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,875
He gave his life to the
service of his country.

38
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,750
And you dare exploit his death

39
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,041
by declaring yourself his son?

40
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,666
You are a liar and a coward!

41
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,791
And I will see to it
your crimes are exposed!

42
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,791
I want this DNA tested,
immediately!

43
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,708
Hey...

44
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,583
Sorry, it looks like they're
not gonna let me leave with you.

45
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,333
So listen...

46
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,708
I need to ask you
for one more favor.

47
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:04,291
I need you to try to
find my mom for me.

48
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,833
No, really...

49
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,083
She's here somewhere-

50
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,291
I'm pretty sure I saw
her on Careless Monday.

51
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,875
It was while we were
evacuating everyone,

52
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,750
before the missiles hit.

53
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,458
There was this lady
walking a mini Shiba;

54
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:18,000
she looked at me and ran
like she'd seen a ghost!

55
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,916
Get it? I think that was my mom!

56
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,708
And... the mini Shiba was.

57
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,875
Yeah, I think she recognized me,

58
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:29,583
and that's why she panicked
and ran away without her dog.

59
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,625
I even went around
to all the shelters

60
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,958
looking for her,
but she wasn't there.

61
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,750
Hey wait a second...

62
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,916
does this mean you got
all your memories back?

63
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,458
Sorta... The "Takizawa"
stuff at least.

64
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:47,041
So, you think you
can do that for me?

65
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,666
I'll do my best.

66
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,916
Thanks, Saki...

67
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,583
I'm counting on you!

68
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,833
Oh! And I almost forgot this.

69
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:01,750
This is...

70
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,583
A memento of our time
together in New York.

71
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,958
I'll be in touch, okay?

72
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,291
Your attention please.

73
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,708
Paging Mr. Kenji Kamiyama.

74
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:32,000
Please pick up the nearest
white courtesy phone.

75
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,250
Mr. Kenji Kamiyama...

76
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,166
please pick up the nearest
white courtesy phone.

77
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,958
Saki! Over here!

78
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,625
So you're alone?

79
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,250
Prime Minister Iinuma's
supporters

80
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,750
stopped Takizawa and
dragged him off somewhere.

81
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:45,875
What?

82
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,125
On the bright side,

83
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,583
they at least helped him
avoid the media for now.

84
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,833
Not to mention all
of these guys.

85
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,083
They started showing up

86
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,750
once word got out
you were coming.

87
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,250
Some of 'em have been
camped out since yesterday.

88
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,625
We need to get out
of here, and fast.

89
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:00,791
Come on.

90
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,916
Before someone
recognizes you from TV.

91
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,833
I should call
Hirasawa right away

92
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,750
and tell him about
Takizawa's mother.

93
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,166
Oh, hold on... Here...

94
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,875
If you're gonna use your cell,

95
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,291
download this
Air Ship app first.

96
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,416
It links to a secure Voice Over
IP site Itazu set up for us.

97
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,041
You can't be too careful.

98
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,875
Use this to talk from now on.

99
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,083
We think all of our
phones are being tapped.

100
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,541
By who?

101
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,958
Guess you've missed a lot huh?

102
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,458
We found out the
police are trying

103
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,458
to frame Eden of the East
as the terrorist group

104
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,166
behind the missile attacks.

105
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,125
Look, don't worry.

106
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,750
I'll go get the car.

107
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,958
Yes, Hello. Saki?

108
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,583
Ah. Good.

109
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,125
Well, I'm glad you're safe;

110
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,041
we were starting
to worry about you.

111
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,041
And Takizawa?

112
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:06,000
Right. Right. I see.

113
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,625
Got it. But listen,
we had to shut down

114
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,916
the main Eden site
for the time being.

115
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,166
We've moved back into
our college club room;

116
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,458
we're setting up
the old system here.

117
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,291
Right. Not a problem.

118
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,666
We'll send you a password
so you can log in.

119
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,333
Yeah, that'll help, thanks.

120
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,458
I'll talk to you soon, then.

121
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,916
'Kay, let's see. Next is.

122
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,750
Yes, hello? Saki?

123
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,583
You okay? What's wrong?

124
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:45,000
Wait--you're back? Already?

125
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,500
What, now? You're joking, right?

126
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,125
What'd she say?

127
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:57,125
She's asking us if we
can bring her the dog!

128
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,000
Saki, you know how early

129
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,541
we have to get up
to open the bakery.

130
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,458
Yeah. I'm sorry.

131
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,500
You're a life saver, sis!

132
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,791
So are they bringing the dog?

133
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:12,833
Yeah.

134
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,583
Good. That's great.

135
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,833
Oh and, I just tried
running a quick image search

136
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,083
to see what turned up.

137
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,416
Check it out.

138
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:30,166
"Have Public Security Division
investigate Eden of the East?"

139
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,541
That's bad.

140
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,833
And we've still got to worry

141
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:36,083
about Mononobe trying
to attack Juiz again.

142
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:43,458
I got lucky Kuroha was
watching out for me last time.

143
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,291
But I'm on my own
from this point;

144
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:48,125
it's up to me to get
everyone out of this mess.

145
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,833
C'mon, think...

146
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,791
I can't use Juiz or the other
Seleção'll know where I am.

147
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,750
Okada...? No, Takizawa!

148
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,125
Found you, you son of a bitch!

149
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:18,875
Well... Actually,
I'm Akira Iinuma now.

150
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,125
I know! And what's up with that?

151
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,333
First you're the Air King,

152
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,375
and now you're s'posed
to be the PM's son?

153
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,916
Then you call us to the
airport and try to sneak off!

154
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,125
What in the hell are
you tryin' to pull here?

155
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,291
I tell you one thing,

156
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,125
I am not gettin' naked
again, you got me?

157
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,041
So you're one of the NEETs?

158
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:37,208
One of the twenty-thousand?
I didn't call you.

159
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,666
I dunno, maybe Number Two
gathered you guys here.

160
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,291
Quit jerkin' me around!

161
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,583
We're already far enough up

162
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,666
shit creek as it
is thanks to you!

163
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,333
Everyone was callin'
us "AKX20000",

164
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,791
treatin' us like popstars...

165
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,750
next thing you know
we're yesterday's news.

166
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,625
We stopped bein' cool and
started bein' NEETs again.

167
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,333
all 'cause a' you!

168
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,541
Actually...

169
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,500
I don't think that part
was really my fault.

170
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,500
Dude... It so was!

171
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,458
Okay... You win...

172
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:07,125
I'll make it right... but first,
I'm gonna need a favor.

173
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,791
You promise we're gonna
go back to bein' cool again?

174
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,541
Uh. Sure. Probably.

175
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,458
Hey, we don't have all day here!

176
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,666
The press and the NEETs

177
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,250
are still combing
this place for you.

178
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,666
We need to leave.

179
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:36,041
That's good, keep your face
hidden 'til we get to the car.

180
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:53,958
Okay, all set.

181
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,041
I just sent the Air Ship
app to Takizawa's phone.

182
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,958
Hey... and there's some
new activity on his log!

183
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,666
What's this about?

184
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,625
"Order business cards"...
"Lease office"...

185
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,833
And wait-- "Request
campaign strategy

186
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,500
from advertising agency"?

187
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,041
Yeah, and all that's
just for starters.

188
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,708
It looks like he's
also throwing money

189
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,041
at anyone in
government or business

190
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,208
with even an ounce
of political clout.

191
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,458
It's like what someone would do

192
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,250
if they were trying
to buy votes.

193
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,375
So he's really making a bid
for the Prime Minister's seat.

194
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:29,875
That's him now.
Takizawa. Yeah, I heard.

195
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,791
Saki already contacted us.

196
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,166
That's good.

197
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,625
And I'm gonna assume
you already know

198
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,666
more about what's
going on than I do...

199
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,791
Like with the
missiles yesterday...

200
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,250
Right.

201
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,833
If Number Eleven
hadn't taken my place

202
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,375
at the last second like she did,

203
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:45,833
it would've been game over.

204
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,291
And I don't think I'm ready

205
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,875
to get knocked out if
Mononobe tries again.

206
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,833
I'm gonna need a way
to secure my Juiz somehow.

207
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,666
Yes, I couldn't agree more.

208
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,416
After all, if you get
eliminated from the game,

209
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,708
it's bad for us too,
right? Here.

210
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,291
We've already been doing
some digging into this.

211
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,041
I'm going to pass the
phone to someone

212
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,458
who'll be able to give you
better answers than I can.

213
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,041
'Sup, Vintage Boy.

214
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,416
'Bout time you got back.

215
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,625
Hey, Panties?
How's it goin', man?

216
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,791
We can do small
talk later, dude.

217
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,083
Now listen, I've looked through
all the old activity logs,

218
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,541
so I knew that Number Twelve
was placin' a lot of orders

219
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,041
for drivers and
gasoline for some reason.

220
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,958
'Part I didn't
know 'til yesterday,

221
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,041
was that he had these
trucks drivin' around on

222
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,333
an endless loop up
and down the expressway.

223
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,666
That slick bastard Number One

224
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,875
definitely got the
drop on us there.

225
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,750
Soon as that missile
attack happened,

226
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,500
I started monitoring
all the traffic cams

227
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,000
on the Chuo Expressway.

228
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,541
The trucks scattered at first--

229
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,833
guess they didn't like gettin'
the shit blown out of 'em--

230
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,791
but I confirmed that they
started formin' back up

231
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,041
into a new caravan
a few hours ago.

232
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,125
Really? Man, you are the best!

233
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,041
I cannot argue with the truth.

234
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:52,000
So... I've got eyes on
Trailer Number Nine right now,

235
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,666
just past the
Kawasaki-Ukishima exit.

236
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,416
And by my math,
considering the time

237
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,791
and distance they've
been traveling,

238
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,791
I figure they're about
due for a pit stop

239
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,791
so they can fuel up
and switch drivers.

240
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,416
So that means?

241
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,958
It means the Juiz's are prob'ly
gonna pull over in Umihotaru!

242
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,291
"Umihotaru"?

243
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,708
And there you have it.

244
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:14,291
So. You have your
next move figured out yet?

245
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,708
Looks like I need to head

246
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,583
to this Umihotaru place
before I can do anything else.

247
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:19,708
I mean, without Juiz,

248
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,916
I'm just a guy with
no memory, right?

249
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,916
If you're "just a guy",

250
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,708
then what does that
make the rest of us, huh?

251
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,291
Know what I said when they
started coming after Eden?

252
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,041
"What would Takizawa do."

253
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,041
Because no matter what
anyone's thrown at you.

254
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,000
You're still out there
on your own, fighting.

255
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,166
But, this time,

256
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,000
we'll be fighting
right there beside you.

257
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,666
However this turns out,
we're with you.

258
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,458
I'll head to Umihotaru now.

259
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,208
Let's meet up there, 'kay?

260
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,375
You sure?

261
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,416
If you guys get any
further involved you

262
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,458
won't ever be able to go
back to your normal lives.

263
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,375
Well, you let us
worry about that.

264
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,541
Besides, we're NEETs.

265
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,375
We never had normal
lives to begin with.

266
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,875
Okay, then.
See you at Umihotaru.

267
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,666
Hi!

268
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,458
I think it's safe
to come out now.

269
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,041
Hey!

270
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,000
Bam! Got'cha!

271
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,625
Aw, you should see the looks
on your faces right now!

272
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,125
Totally fooled!
Am I good or what?

273
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,916
Hey, wait, what're you doin'--?

274
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,666
Yeah, well, I still got you!

275
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,666
You're never gonna find him now!

276
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,333
Suck it, assholes!

277
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,041
Hey.

278
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,375
Sorry. Traffic was bad.

279
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,958
Listen, I know you're busy,

280
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,750
but, it'd be nice if you
came home once in a while.

281
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,000
Yeah...

282
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,458
Well. Here you go.

283
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,500
Look, I promise...

284
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,083
I'll explain everything
soon, okay?

285
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:46,791
Don't worry.

286
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,208
We're on your side here.

287
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,458
Thanks, Ryosuke.

288
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:56,458
That's good.

289
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:57,625
Looks like she's finally found

290
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,833
something she can
devote herself to.

291
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,083
Ah... Good deal.

292
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,000
You work fast, as always.

293
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,666
Okay then, the guy I told
you about is on his way,

294
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,041
so be ready with a
nice lukewarm welcome.

295
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:13,916
Yeah... That's the one...

296
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I know, he looks like
a crazy person,

297
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,375
but he's harmless enough.

298
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,916
You just give him the
goods like we talked about.

299
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,333
Exactly!

300
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,208
Whatever works
for you's okay by me...

301
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,916
I know that you'll get it done.

302
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,208
"The message on the
back of his shirt,

303
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,958
'Hey Outside, shoot
some more,' appeared to be

304
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,791
a defiant accusation
that the missile attacks

305
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,416
were launched from abroad.

306
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,708
Clearly the sharp
nationalist rhetoric

307
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,000
of the right leaning Iinuma
is still alive and well."

308
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:52,333
Yeah. That oughta'
stir up some shit.

309
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:53,625
That's good.

310
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:54,958
I'm sure Number Nine thinks

311
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,708
he was just thumbing
his nose at Mr. Outside...

312
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,625
but the rest of the world
won't see it that way.

313
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,958
Don't sneak up on me like that!

314
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,375
I thought you were asleep.

315
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:12,291
You're still playing even though
your Juiz was destroyed?

316
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,250
Why wouldn't I be?

317
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:17,166
I still got my pride
on the line here, right?

318
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,250
Sure. I guess...

319
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,958
I've got everything
ready for you, so...

320
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,250
time to get goin'.

321
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,000
Should be more
money than you need.

322
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,916
You'll find the
address in there too.

323
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,583
Got it, thanks.

324
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,541
I'll pay you back. Somehow.

325
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:36,375
Yeah. Don't sweat it.

326
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,666
So, what now?

327
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,666
Annie?

328
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,541
You found your way back!

329
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:08,666
I knew you would!

330
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,250
So... your dog's name
is "Angelika",

331
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,500
is that right?

332
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:23,208
Yeah. It's a pretty
name, isn't it?

333
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,458
Now then.

334
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,000
As for if I'm this missile
terrorist's mother, I'm sorry.

335
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,666
There's not a chance.

336
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,708
Just think about
it for a second.

337
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,041
According to your story,

338
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,500
he only lived with his
mother in New York

339
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,208
until he was five, right?

340
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,875
Even if he says
he recognized me,

341
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,291
childhood memories
aren't very reliable.

342
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,750
So then, what was that
on Careless Monday?

343
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:47,833
Why would you run off

344
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,375
and leave your dog
when you saw him?

345
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,291
It's simple.

346
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,250
I ran because they told me to.

347
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,166
It saved my life, but it
doesn't change the fact

348
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,708
that my apartment
was completely trashed.

349
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,041
Have you ever even
been to New York?

350
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:06,666
Oh, sure... Once...
On a long vacation.

351
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,833
And... did you ever
stay at the Gramercy?

352
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:11,208
It's possible.

353
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,625
There's a movie
theater near there,

354
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,250
it's called the Angelika.

355
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,083
The same as your dog's name.

356
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,541
Is that just a coincidence?

357
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,916
It must be.

358
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:27,541
All right, so what about
children, do you have any?

359
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,875
Yes, I was a mother, once.

360
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,666
And what happened, if you
don't mind my asking?

361
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:41,958
He told me that
when he was five,

362
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,000
his mom abandoned him

363
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:45,208
in a department
store here in Japan.

364
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,333
She gave him some
money to buy something,

365
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:51,208
and by the time he turned around

366
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:55,416
from the register she
was nowhere to be found.

367
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,791
Sorry, but do you have

368
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,958
a restroom here you
think I could use?

369
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:17,750
In the back.

370
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:36,291
Hey, this is her.
She was kinda' hot.

371
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,083
Is that who I think it is?

372
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:49,083
Saki, here.

373
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,125
Is that her?

374
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:54,125
Yeah.

375
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:56,083
But check out the
guy behind her.

376
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:58,083
Who does that look like to you?

377
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:01,791
Prime Minister Iinuma?

378
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,166
Yeah, right?

379
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,291
Dead ringer.

380
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,083
But what does that mean?

381
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:09,166
I don't know exactly.

382
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,458
But this whole story

383
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:12,708
about Takizawa being
Iinuma's illegitimate son.

384
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:15,041
What if Juiz didn't
just make it up?

385
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:18,000
What if there's a chance
that it's really true?

386
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:25,125
Correct me if I'm
wrong about this.

387
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:28,250
But I thought the plan was
to have Public Security

388
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,041
arrest the man who
launched the missiles,

389
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:31,583
along with his cohorts,

390
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:34,416
and tie this whole
thing up nice and neat?

391
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,125
Yes.

392
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,416
You assured me that
this could easily

393
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,541
be arranged with Mr. Ato's
little "magic" phone.

394
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:43,750
And yet, not only
does he remain at large,

395
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:46,875
but now I'm hearing word
that his claims might be true.

396
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:49,625
He may actually be Iinuma's son.

397
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:50,666
Oh?

398
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,625
And when our
foreign neighbors see

399
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:54,500
the alleged son of a hawkish PM

400
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:57,041
wearing brazen
accusations on a t-shirt.

401
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:59,583
They may not respond
kindly to the insinuation

402
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:02,583
that they are responsible
for the missile attacks.

403
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:04,458
I will look into all of this.

404
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:07,000
You have nothing
to worry about, sir.

405
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:09,416
Mononobe.

406
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,291
I've called in many
favors to build support

407
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:14,166
for the one-hundred-percent
estate tax bill.

408
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,750
Likewise for the reestablishment
of the Home Ministry.

409
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:19,750
I am aware, sir.

410
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:21,333
Then perhaps you'll
agree that the time

411
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:25,041
has come for some slightly
more extreme measures.

412
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:31,000
This is it.

413
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:37,625
Yes, hello... It's Mononobe.

414
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,208
Listen, it turns out
there's a possibility

415
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:41,416
that Seijiro Iinuma
had a secret lover

416
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,291
about twenty years ago.

417
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,666
I need you to see what
you can dig up on that.

418
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,666
You don't say.

419
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,916
Is that something you found out

420
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,291
during your recent
investigation in New York?

421
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:01,333
Yes. Yes.

422
00:26:01,416 --> 00:26:03,500
So you're saying that
it was Mr. Iinuma himself

423
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:05,416
who kept the reservation
on the hotel room

424
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,291
at the Gramercy.

425
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:10,250
It was empty until he
moved in six months ago,

426
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:12,666
but it was paid for all along.

427
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,583
Understood. Good.

428
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:16,041
I'll leave it to you, then.

429
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:20,250
Juiz... Put me through

430
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:22,958
to the Tax Bureau's Criminal
Investigation Division.

431
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:29,958
Umihotaru?

432
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:38,500
Oh... it's from Grandfather.

433
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:43,250
So where did all the
drivers run off to?

434
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:44,166
I'm having them
take a little break

435
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,083
in the rest area.

436
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:48,583
They did drive non-stop
from Yamanashi.

437
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:50,541
We've been working
non-stop, too.

438
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:54,666
Well, c'mon. What did he say?

439
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,166
He says we're taking
the current measures

440
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,500
as a precaution to keep
the game progressing...

441
00:26:58,583 --> 00:26:59,666
And beyond that.

442
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,750
We keep doing our
jobs like we always do,

443
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:03,958
and we don't interfere
with any request...

444
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:04,875
No matter what.

445
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:06,416
We know that already.

446
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,208
Like he always says, the
Seleção and Juiz play the game.

447
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:11,833
"And we're the kids
who shag the balls."

448
00:27:11,916 --> 00:27:12,916
We got it.

449
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,166
But what happens
if Number One decides

450
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,666
to order another
missile attack right now?

451
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:21,208
Personally, I'd rather
not get blown up, you know?

452
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:23,833
Maybe we could try hiding
the trucks on our own?

453
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:25,125
Yeah?

454
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:27,291
Come on...

455
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:28,750
You know we can't do that.

456
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:31,416
We'd be violating
Grandfather's orders.

457
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,750
And besides, I doubt
even Number One

458
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:36,458
would be daring enough
to launch a missile here.

459
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,041
Hey... Look over there.

460
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,791
Isn't that Number Nine?

461
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:52,125
Yeah, you're right!

462
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,250
Juiz speaking.

463
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:09,291
Hey!

464
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:10,791
Number Nine!

465
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:13,125
You seem to be within the
system's effective range again!

466
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:14,750
Yeah.

467
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:21,208
Matter of fact.

468
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:23,041
I'm patting you on
the back as we speak.

469
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:24,250
Can't you tell?

470
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:27,291
What? I'm afraid
my system's not equipped

471
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:28,750
with a sense of touch.

472
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,625
So that's a bit beyond me.

473
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,041
Too bad.

474
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:35,625
I guess that sort of
spoils the whole surprise.

475
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:36,875
Now doesn't it.

476
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:38,416
I'm sorry to disappoint.

477
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,166
It's nothing to apologize for.

478
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,708
I'm just glad I finally
get to meet you.

479
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,041
Number 9...

480
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:46,625
What brought you here to see me?

481
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:47,750
Well.

482
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:49,958
There was a missile
attack on you guys

483
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:51,750
so I came out here
to rescue you.

484
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:54,041
Didn't you know about that?

485
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:56,083
No... I didn't...

486
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:58,500
So how will you protect
me from more missiles?

487
00:28:58,583 --> 00:28:59,833
Good question.

488
00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:02,500
I haven't actually thought
that far ahead just yet.

489
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:09,083
Hey, Number One just asked

490
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:10,875
for his trailer to be moved!

491
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:16,916
So this time he just plans
to steal his own Juiz?

492
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:23,916
Juiz...

493
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,208
Can you make it
so that I know how

494
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:27,041
to drive a trailer real fast?

495
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:28,791
Y'know, like in The Matrix?

496
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:30,083
Pardon?

497
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:32,833
Number Nine, you know
you're already licensed

498
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:34,791
to drive all vehicle classes,

499
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:37,458
from Heavy all the way
down to Motorcycle.

500
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:39,875
Huh? You don't say.

501
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,416
How 'bout that. Okay...

502
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,416
And I think I just figured out
what to do next, Juiz.

503
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:57,208
Now Number Nine is doing it?

504
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:58,875
There's nothing
in his activity log.

505
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:01,416
Does that mean
he's driving it himself?

506
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,416
I get it!

507
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,750
If he wants to stay
safe from missiles,

508
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:06,625
then all he has to do
is keep his trailer close

509
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:08,208
to Number One's, right?

510
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:09,666
That's my Number Nine!

511
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:14,416
So what now?

512
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,166
You think we should
tell Grandfather?

513
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,041
Hmm. That's against
the rules, too.

514
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:20,875
As long as
Number Nine is doing this

515
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:23,041
without any help
from his Juiz...

516
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:25,875
then the other Seleção
don't know what he's up to.

517
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:29,625
And if they don't get to know,
neither does grandfather.

518
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:31,666
Good point.

519
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:39,250
What? He says he's driving Juiz.

520
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:40,375
Yeah...

521
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:41,791
And it looks like
Number One's trailer

522
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:43,666
is headed back into town, too.

523
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,875
So where are all
you guys right now?

524
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,458
We're close.
We're in the tunnel now.

525
00:30:50,541 --> 00:30:51,833
Really?

526
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,916
Well alright, then! So am I!

527
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:57,666
So you're in the
tunnel next to ours

528
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,083
going the other way?

529
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:03,750
We'll make a u-turn at
Umihotaru.

530
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:05,708
Tell him we'll call him
back in a few minutes.

531
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:08,458
Got that?

532
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:11,000
So he hijacked Juiz, eh?

533
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:12,750
Guess I'm not surprised.

534
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:14,875
It's Number Three.

535
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:17,583
She's requesting
"Sweets for Saizo".

536
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:20,041
"Saizo"? Wait.

537
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:22,791
Like as in Saizo Ato?

538
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,916
It's too bad I don't have Yuki,

539
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,333
I could send him to
pay a visit in advance.

540
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:45,375
Yes, Juiz...

541
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:47,750
I'd like you to send a message
to this sweets parlor for me.

542
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,458
So that's it.

543
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:04,750
I'm not Japanese anymore.

544
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,875
Yeah, so listen.

545
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:09,541
If you two aren't gonna
order anything else,

546
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:11,416
I wanna go ahead
and close up shop.

547
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,625
Oh! Uh...

548
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:15,291
We'll take two more
Mango Lassies, please.

549
00:32:21,416 --> 00:32:23,541
Perfect...

550
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:25,041
It looks like these two have

551
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:27,416
brought some unwanted
guests to my door.

552
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:30,500
No way their tab was worth this.

553
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:38,750
Right. Right...
Yeah... I got'cha...

554
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:40,875
I was just lookin'
at the same entry.

555
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:48,500
According to the detail log,
it looks like he's in Tokyo.

556
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:52,708
But doesn't Number Three live
all the way out in Fukuoka?

557
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:55,041
That doesn't sound good.

558
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:56,458
What'cha got?

559
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,500
Well, I hate to say it,

560
00:32:58,583 --> 00:32:59,666
but I think we might have played

561
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,666
right into Public
Security's hands here.

562
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,625
'Til a few years ago,
this room was used

563
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:07,166
by an extremist student group

564
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,541
called the Eastern Federation
of Revolutionaries.

565
00:33:09,625 --> 00:33:11,166
All they gotta do
is connect a few dots

566
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,208
to make it look
like we're a spin-off.

567
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,708
And from there, it wouldn't
be much of a stretch

568
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:17,500
to frame Eden as a
terrorist organization.

569
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,416
Open up!

570
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,833
You are wanted
for trespassing...

571
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:27,416
as well as aiding and
abetting subversive activities!

572
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,625
Come out of there right now!

573
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:33,500
What's going on, Panties?

574
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:35,041
Hey! Panties--!

575
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:39,083
Well, the good news is.

576
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:41,958
I have a hiding place
all ready for us.

577
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:46,791
Over here.

578
00:33:47,916 --> 00:33:50,833
You know I'm kind'f
a big guy, right?

579
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:58,708
Hey.

580
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,875
Damn, Kasuga.

581
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:39,708
You didn't dig this
whole tunnel, did ya?

582
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:42,416
Sure, why not!

583
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:46,125
Okay, Fine man,
it was already here.

584
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:48,083
It has been since
the late sixties.

585
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:50,791
During the All-Campus Joint
Struggle Committee era,

586
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:52,958
the Eastern Federation
of Revolutionaries dug

587
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:56,708
this tunnel to try to aid
the Narita Airport protests.

588
00:34:58,333 --> 00:34:59,583
I see.

589
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:01,041
Who'da thought that
some tunnel built

590
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:02,750
for baby boomers
to play militant

591
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:05,375
in would wind up
savin' my ass one day.

592
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:06,583
Yeah, I know,
it's like we're usin'

593
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:09,250
their own dirty tricks
against 'em, right?

594
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:11,791
I think the irony's great.

595
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:15,083
Sure. So I guess it's true then,

596
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:17,208
the only thing those
old bastards ever did

597
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:19,958
for us was dig us
into a great big hole.

598
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:37,666
Good to see you, Takizawa...

599
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:38,875
So what's up?

600
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:39,958
Takky!

601
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:41,541
Hey! How's it goin'?

602
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:43,916
Been a long time, right, Mittan?

603
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,750
My name's not Mittan!

604
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:48,625
Still as feisty as ever.

605
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:51,208
So let's get to it.

606
00:35:51,291 --> 00:35:53,708
That other driver went
inside to take a break.

607
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:55,125
Hirasawa...

608
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:56,166
Why don't you jump in there

609
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,666
and try takin' the wheel.

610
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,375
And don't worry 'bout missiles,

611
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:01,333
Trailer One is totally safe.

612
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:02,166
Hold on!

613
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,166
I don't know the first thing

614
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,875
about driving a
monster like that!

615
00:36:04,958 --> 00:36:05,708
Hey, I managed!

616
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:07,583
I'm sure you'll do fine!

617
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,583
This is not a good idea.

618
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:12,958
Now that I think about it,

619
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:14,916
I used to have a
Heavy-class license.

620
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,041
You what?

621
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:28,791
Let's go you muthas! Movin' out!

622
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:38,208
All right... Try to keep up!

623
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:39,708
Shouldn't you at least tell me

624
00:36:39,791 --> 00:36:41,375
where we're going first?

625
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,916
And here you go.

626
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:53,416
Take a look out front,

627
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,666
but don't be obvious about it.

628
00:36:57,541 --> 00:36:58,750
There's a window
in the storage closet

629
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,000
by the bathroom.

630
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:02,083
You can slip out through there.

631
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:05,625
Now, if you'll both
excuse me, I'm going first.

632
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:02,000
All right. Listen,
Saki, you go after her.

633
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:03,250
I'll stay behind
and try to stall them

634
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:04,708
for as long as I can.

635
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:08,291
If Takizawa really is
Seijiro Iinuma's son...

636
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:09,625
then that might just be enough

637
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:11,666
to turn this whole
situation around.

638
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,166
Talk to her.

639
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,416
Do whatever you have to do,

640
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,375
but get the truth out
of her, no matter what.

641
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:19,541
But--! Osugi!

642
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:23,916
Just go! Now, Saki.

643
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:28,458
Thank you... Osugi.

644
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,250
Oh!

645
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:44,125
Sorry, guys, but we're actually
already closed for the night!

646
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:54,000
Ah, Ms. Iinuma
testifies tomorrow.

647
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:56,416
Now that ought'a
be pretty interesting.

648
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:00,541
So, Mononobe...

649
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:02,333
Looks like I'm about
to call checkmate

650
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:04,583
and I didn't even need my phone.

651
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,583
The Tax Bureau?

652
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:10,750
2G, we've got problems!

653
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:13,375
There's an army of tax
inspectors out there!

654
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:20,375
Not bad, bastard.

655
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:29,166
So you're okay. Good.

656
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,541
Then have you figured
out the connection

657
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:32,750
between Number Three
and Mr. Outside?

658
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:35,166
No, we're still
workin' on that...

659
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,750
but, we know we're not

660
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,416
the only ones
watchin' her activity.

661
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,250
Check it... These sweets?

662
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:43,583
They come from Shinbashi,
this shop called "Odafuji".

663
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:45,458
It's in Number One's log, too.

664
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:47,583
He made a request to
have a message included

665
00:39:47,666 --> 00:39:49,500
with the sweets when
they're delivered.

666
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:52,416
And you are not gonna
believe what it says.

667
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,291
Get a load of this, dude-- 

668
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:05,083
I see.

669
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:07,208
Well, Takizawa has
his hands full now.

670
00:40:07,291 --> 00:40:09,083
I'll go myself.

671
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:11,500
Look, just send me
the detail log, okay?

672
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:12,541
Hey, hold on!

673
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:14,208
It's too dangerous to go alone!

674
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:16,041
Anything could happen out there!

675
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:19,583
If it does. You guys take over.

676
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:21,666
I trust that Eden will
be safe in your hands.

677
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,541
Shut up, dipshit!

678
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:25,041
Don't even joke about that!

679
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:27,791
Just promise me you'll
be nice to Micchon, okay?

680
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:29,791
You know, she was
pretty mad at you earlier

681
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:31,333
when you hung up
the phone on her.

682
00:40:31,416 --> 00:40:32,708
What? Ahh.

683
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,666
Wait! Please!

684
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:53,625
I apologize.

685
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:55,875
I borrowed this
without asking you.

686
00:40:57,041 --> 00:40:58,250
This photo...

687
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:00,833
It's you and Prime Minister
Iinuma, isn't it?

688
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:07,000
And, um. I can't
help but notice.

689
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:08,666
You're pregnant.

690
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,958
You said you were a mother once.

691
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:13,166
Wasn't that child Takizawa?

692
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:25,333
Takizawa's past is...

693
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:27,541
Well, it's almost
completely lost now.

694
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:29,958
So, if he were to get
even a piece of it back,

695
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:31,625
I can't begin to
tell you how much

696
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:33,708
that knowledge
might help him out.

697
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,958
Even if the public
ends up despising him

698
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:37,250
as the terrorist who launched

699
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:39,625
the missile attacks
on Careless Monday.

700
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:40,916
If there's a chance

701
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,416
that he really is
Prime Minister Iinuma's son.

702
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,666
He might be able to do
something to fix this situation.

703
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,791
Please tell me the truth.

704
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:52,916
You really are Takizawa's
mother, now aren't you?

705
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:04,041
This picture really
does take me back.

706
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:07,375
Here's what I know.

707
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,416
Money is the great equalizer.

708
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,458
If you have it, then
that's all that matters.

709
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:14,625
Things like age and
status mean nothing.

710
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:15,958
It may seem shallow,

711
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:18,208
saying money is the most
important thing there is,

712
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:20,500
but that's what
my life has taught me.

713
00:42:20,583 --> 00:42:23,500
And if I could teach
my child only one lesson

714
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:26,375
about the world, there it is.

715
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,916
So, how does your mystery boy

716
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,291
feel now about being
given, what was it?

717
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:36,625
500 yen? And abandoned.

718
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:39,875
I'd guess he'd have
some strong opinions

719
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:41,625
about money as well.

720
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:46,291
It's a long story...
but Takizawa...

721
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:47,458
he was put in a position

722
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:50,125
to use ten billion yen
however he wanted.

723
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:52,041
But even with all that money,

724
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:54,833
he's never spent a
single yen of it on himself.

725
00:42:54,916 --> 00:42:57,333
That's the kind of guy he is.

726
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:00,333
I see...

727
00:43:00,416 --> 00:43:04,083
Then he couldn't be my son.

728
00:43:22,916 --> 00:43:24,458
I'm afraid that
I can't help you.

729
00:43:24,541 --> 00:43:26,041
Good night.

730
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:40,041
Saki!

731
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:44,041
What happened?

732
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:46,375
Did you find out if she's
really Takizawa's mother?

733
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:48,041
It's her...

734
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,791
She didn't come out and
say it, but it has to be.

735
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:55,416
I mean. She knew
that it was 500 yen.

736
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,958
I should call Takizawa now...

737
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:49,583
Shouldn't I?

738
00:44:49,666 --> 00:44:52,458
I should just tell him
"I found your mother".

739
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:54,458
"You were right all along,

740
00:44:54,541 --> 00:44:57,083
she really was your mother."

741
00:44:57,166 --> 00:44:58,000
Yeah. Okay.

742
00:44:58,083 --> 00:45:00,000
So then what are
you waiting for?

743
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:02,666
Because if... I tell him.

744
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,708
I mean... when I tell him.

745
00:45:04,791 --> 00:45:06,208
I don't think.

746
00:45:06,291 --> 00:45:08,833
I don't think Takizawa will
ever come back to me again;

747
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:10,625
I'll lose him for good!

748
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:15,208
C'mon, Saki.

749
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,708
Come on! I won't
let you give up now!

750
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,250
Let's just go find Takizawa.

751
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:27,791
We'll go talk to him
in person. Okay?

752
00:45:27,875 --> 00:45:30,208
I'm sure he's waiting
for you to come to him.

753
00:45:42,625 --> 00:45:43,916
I'm sorry.

754
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,458
I know I've put you through
a lot of trouble, ma'am.

755
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:51,916
Take a seat.

756
00:45:56,791 --> 00:45:59,208
First you disappear without
a trace from the airport.

757
00:45:59,291 --> 00:46:01,750
Then you drive a truck up
to my front door.

758
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:05,000
Moreover, I have
been told that this

759
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:06,541
is the very same truck
that the government

760
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:09,083
launched an
attack on last night.

761
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:11,750
So then, what is the
meaning of all this?

762
00:46:11,833 --> 00:46:13,791
Well... the thing is...

763
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:17,375
that truck's my only hope
of salvaging this situation.

764
00:46:17,458 --> 00:46:19,291
so I kinda had
to bring it with me.

765
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:21,958
I guess it is
pretty inconvenient.

766
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:24,583
You're very bold...

767
00:46:24,666 --> 00:46:27,333
but I suppose you have
to be to be a terrorist.

768
00:46:27,416 --> 00:46:29,791
Wait. I'm not a terrorist!

769
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:32,458
Then what would
you call yourself?

770
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:37,875
It's kinda hard to explain,
but I guess you'd say.

771
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:40,083
I guess you'd say that.

772
00:46:40,166 --> 00:46:42,833
I'm someone who's been chosen
to make this country better.

773
00:46:42,916 --> 00:46:45,750
All terrorists make such claims.

774
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:48,333
Uh... well... yeah, but...

775
00:46:48,416 --> 00:46:50,041
How do I put this.

776
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:52,625
There's just no
easy way to explain.

777
00:46:52,708 --> 00:46:55,541
I've no interest in hearing
your rationalizations...

778
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:57,333
And I have
absolutely no intention

779
00:46:57,416 --> 00:47:00,416
of arguing the finer
points of your position.

780
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,041
All I do want to know,

781
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:05,375
in no uncertain terms,
is what you are after.

782
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:07,333
I want to know what
it is you hope to gain

783
00:47:07,416 --> 00:47:10,500
by suddenly claiming to be
my husband's illegitimate son.

784
00:47:10,583 --> 00:47:14,291
So, is it attention?
Or is it money?

785
00:47:14,375 --> 00:47:16,125
Or is this just another
terrorist act designed

786
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,958
to spread confusion
and harm this nation?

787
00:47:19,041 --> 00:47:20,041
None'a that!

788
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:21,458
I promise, this business

789
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:24,041
about being Iinuma's son,
it wasn't my idea.

790
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:26,875
Things just got out of hand.

791
00:47:26,958 --> 00:47:29,916
All I wanted, was to become
the king of this country.

792
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,541
I thought that maybe
then I'd actually be able

793
00:47:31,625 --> 00:47:33,083
to do some good
for all the people

794
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:35,041
who are struggling out there.

795
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:36,666
But, somewhere along the way,

796
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:39,291
I guess "king" got turned
into "prime minister".

797
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:42,083
Now wait...

798
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:45,083
Do you honestly expect me
to take this seriously?

799
00:47:45,166 --> 00:47:47,041
Yes. And believe me,

800
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:50,208
I know exactly how crazy all
of this must sound to you.

801
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:53,208
But... it's still the truth.

802
00:47:56,291 --> 00:48:00,208
Honestly, I'd rather not
become king if I can avoid it.

803
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:01,750
It is a tough job...

804
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:03,250
People want you
to take responsibility

805
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:04,708
for all their problems,

806
00:48:04,791 --> 00:48:07,166
and then they complain
about everything you do.

807
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,833
I might have to erase
my memories again

808
00:48:09,916 --> 00:48:12,583
just to deal with everything.

809
00:48:15,416 --> 00:48:18,083
But still my request
was accepted...

810
00:48:18,166 --> 00:48:21,666
so that means it's got
to be worth a try, at least.

811
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,208
Your request to become king...

812
00:48:24,291 --> 00:48:26,666
was "accepted"?

813
00:48:28,875 --> 00:48:31,125
My late husband... Seijiro...

814
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:33,458
he actually retired
from politics...

815
00:48:33,541 --> 00:48:34,708
He was determined

816
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:37,208
to live a carefree life
as a private citizen...

817
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:38,750
Then his supporters
convinced him

818
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,791
to become Prime Minister again.

819
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:42,166
And in the end,

820
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:46,166
he passed away before
he was able to do anything.

821
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:48,833
Even if you do somehow convince

822
00:48:48,916 --> 00:48:52,041
the public to accept
you as "Iinuma's Son".

823
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:55,666
I would say that's hardly
a guarantee of success.

824
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:57,125
You do understand you'll have

825
00:48:57,208 --> 00:48:59,625
even less power
than a terrorist.

826
00:48:59,708 --> 00:49:01,500
Yeah... I get that.

827
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:03,666
But I refuse to give up
'til I meet the man

828
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,375
who got me into this mess.

829
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:07,375
I still owe'im a good punch.

830
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:38,416
Mister Mononobe?

831
00:49:38,916 --> 00:49:41,333
That's very odd; how did
he know to look here?

832
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:44,791
Mister Mononobe.

833
00:49:44,875 --> 00:49:46,000
Wait, I'm sorry,

834
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,833
but did he come here
to see me by any chance?

835
00:49:47,916 --> 00:49:49,875
Well, yes...

836
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:52,333
Actually, he did ask for you.

837
00:49:55,083 --> 00:49:58,250
This is so strange.

838
00:49:58,708 --> 00:50:00,166
I'm sorry.

839
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:02,750
In any case.

840
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,375
You may use the study for now.

841
00:50:05,458 --> 00:50:06,916
However, you should be aware,

842
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,833
I've been summoned
to give testimony

843
00:50:08,916 --> 00:50:11,916
before the Diet
inquiry panel tomorrow.

844
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
While I may have
temporarily harbored you here

845
00:50:14,083 --> 00:50:15,916
as a matter of courtesy,

846
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,875
given the possibility
you're my husband's son.

847
00:50:18,958 --> 00:50:20,208
Ultimately, when asked,

848
00:50:20,291 --> 00:50:23,250
I will still have to
report you as a terrorist.

849
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:25,000
Right. Understood...

850
00:50:25,083 --> 00:50:27,000
You do what you have to do.

851
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:57,166
So it's been a full thirty years

852
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:59,291
since anyone's even seen Ato.

853
00:51:11,666 --> 00:51:12,791
I have to hand it to you.

854
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:16,541
Somehow you even
convinced Juiz to like you.

855
00:51:16,625 --> 00:51:18,416
Not only that you kept making

856
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,250
out-of nowhere requests that
completely trumped my own,

857
00:51:21,333 --> 00:51:24,208
and neatly turned all
of my plans on their head.

858
00:51:24,291 --> 00:51:28,625
You have managed to outplay
me in this game at every turn.

859
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:30,958
You came here to tell me that?

860
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:32,291
Yes.

861
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:35,333
That, and also to request
a small favor from you.

862
00:51:35,416 --> 00:51:38,250
I've come to ask you to
withdraw from this game.

863
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:39,750
Please.

864
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:43,208
My desire to change
this country of ours

865
00:51:43,291 --> 00:51:47,000
existed long before I began
my career in public service.

866
00:51:47,083 --> 00:51:48,791
But the reality is
that Japan's problems

867
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:51,375
have grown too large,
and become too widespread

868
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:54,083
for any mere bureaucrat
to solve them.

869
00:51:54,166 --> 00:51:56,208
At least by honest means.

870
00:51:57,791 --> 00:51:59,166
By the time I realized this,

871
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:02,125
it was far too late for me
to change course but,

872
00:52:02,208 --> 00:52:06,166
fortunately, that was when this
phone came into my possession.

873
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:50,208
Sorry, but you're
Saizo Ato aren't you?

874
00:52:56,458 --> 00:52:59,250
Well, that depends...
Who're you?

875
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:03,541
Well, I'm a friend of Number
Nine's, Kazuomi Hirasawa.

876
00:53:03,625 --> 00:53:05,625
There are some things
I need to ask you, sir,

877
00:53:05,708 --> 00:53:07,416
if that's alright.

878
00:53:25,708 --> 00:53:27,416
So young man.

879
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,833
If someone suddenly
handed you ten billion yen...

880
00:53:29,916 --> 00:53:31,750
 and then said...

881
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:35,291
"improve this country",
what would you do?

882
00:53:39,625 --> 00:53:41,708
Wait, is that how you
selected the Seleção?

883
00:53:41,791 --> 00:53:44,583
By asking that question
to all of your passengers?

884
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,250
What am I going to
do about that Toshiko?

885
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:57,208
So? What do you want?

886
00:53:57,291 --> 00:53:58,208
Well...

887
00:53:58,291 --> 00:53:59,375
It's obvious you
have no intention

888
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:00,791
of stopping the game...

889
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:03,833
no matter how dangerous
the players' requests become.

890
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:05,791
But I think it's time you
at least told someone

891
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:08,833
what the name of
the game really is.

892
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:10,458
When Ato asked me
what I would do

893
00:54:10,541 --> 00:54:13,000
if I was suddenly
given ten billion yen.

894
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,833
I told him I thought
that the first thing

895
00:54:14,916 --> 00:54:17,333
this country needed
was to go on a diet,

896
00:54:17,416 --> 00:54:19,375
on a nationwide scale.

897
00:54:19,458 --> 00:54:22,541
A government-led redistribution
of human resources...

898
00:54:22,625 --> 00:54:24,875
where the only priority
is the effective functioning

899
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:27,500
of those sectors
with global currency.

900
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,666
I said that,.

901
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:30,708
we had to make Japan
smaller and lighter

902
00:54:30,791 --> 00:54:33,708
on its feet to have any
hope of success in the future.

903
00:54:33,791 --> 00:54:36,875
But... to make that
happen more quickly...

904
00:54:36,958 --> 00:54:38,625
it would first require me

905
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:41,750
to temporarily emasculate
the government.

906
00:54:41,833 --> 00:54:44,166
And that's what Careless
Monday was all about right?

907
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:45,583
Correct...

908
00:54:45,666 --> 00:54:48,458
But it needn't have been
a missile attack specifically.

909
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:50,291
Any event that
stressed the nation

910
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:52,500
to near the breaking point
would have allowed

911
00:54:52,583 --> 00:54:54,166
my plan to proceed.

912
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:55,583
Because after that...

913
00:54:55,666 --> 00:54:58,583
the magic cell phone would
no longer be necessary...

914
00:54:58,666 --> 00:55:00,666
I could take my time
getting the rest done

915
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:03,291
by simply working
my network of connections.

916
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:05,125
So you're saying that
everything I did was.

917
00:55:05,208 --> 00:55:07,041
Yes, as it turned out,

918
00:55:07,125 --> 00:55:08,416
you and Yuki were kind enough

919
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:11,166
to handle most of
the dirtiest work for me.

920
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:13,125
I do appreciate that.

921
00:55:18,125 --> 00:55:19,166
If that was the plan

922
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:21,291
you should've told
me from the start.

923
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:22,458
We've all been acting on our own

924
00:55:22,541 --> 00:55:24,166
because of some idea
that we'd get killed

925
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:26,250
if we didn't play to win...

926
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:28,958
But I would've had no
problem teaming up with you.

927
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:30,250
If we'd put all
our heads together,

928
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:32,541
who knows what we
coulda' come up with.

929
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:36,375
Well, I'm afraid I'm not
so eager to share the glory.

930
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,250
Then maybe you should
be the Prime Minister;

931
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:40,958
did you ever consider that?

932
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:42,750
I would say you're
definitely more suited

933
00:55:42,833 --> 00:55:44,666
to the part than I am.

934
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,500
We're coming to open
the gate right now.

935
00:55:51,583 --> 00:55:54,041
It's okay, nobody's watching.

936
00:55:57,375 --> 00:55:58,416
Where's Takizawa?

937
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,875
They took him
inside the mansion;

938
00:55:59,958 --> 00:56:01,125
he hasn't come out yet.

939
00:56:01,208 --> 00:56:03,791
So... you have any
luck finding his mom?

940
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:06,625
And we found out
some other things, too,

941
00:56:06,708 --> 00:56:08,833
that I really need
to tell him right away.

942
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:14,000
I'll happily bow out of
the game on one condition.

943
00:56:14,083 --> 00:56:17,000
If you'll agree to take
the job as Prime Minister...

944
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:18,958
I'll even promise to
give you my full support.

945
00:56:19,041 --> 00:56:20,541
Tempting as that may be,

946
00:56:20,625 --> 00:56:22,125
I'm afraid I have
to pass on all this

947
00:56:22,208 --> 00:56:24,541
"Prime Minister"
and "King" business.

948
00:56:24,625 --> 00:56:26,291
We live in a nation
of a hundred million

949
00:56:26,375 --> 00:56:28,750
short-sighted,
self-centered fools.

950
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:30,375
But I suspect your dealings

951
00:56:30,458 --> 00:56:32,916
with the masses have
already shown you as much.

952
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:35,208
Well.

953
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:36,791
The Prime Minister functions

954
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:39,208
as little more than
a sacrificial lamb.

955
00:56:39,291 --> 00:56:41,000
You could say he's an outlet

956
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:42,916
for the stress
of Japan's citizens,

957
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,875
who gained their freedom
and became unfree.

958
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:47,666
Take the late Mr. Iinuma here.

959
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:49,250
He died before
he could ever manage

960
00:56:49,333 --> 00:56:51,666
to enact any meaningful change.

961
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,458
So then how are you gonna do it?

962
00:56:53,541 --> 00:56:55,458
How do you plan to make
Japan "light on its feet"

963
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:57,541
without being its leader?

964
00:56:57,625 --> 00:56:59,083
I suppose for starters.

965
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:02,625
I'll try to restrict citizen
freedoms without their noticing.

966
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:05,125
You see, they're
an irresponsible lot

967
00:57:05,208 --> 00:57:07,291
who can't decide
anything for themselves...

968
00:57:07,375 --> 00:57:08,791
but they still refuse to agree

969
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:10,333
to anything anyone
else suggests.

970
00:57:10,416 --> 00:57:13,875
So my plan is to reestablish
the Home Ministry,

971
00:57:13,958 --> 00:57:15,833
and from there, I will
be able to remove them

972
00:57:15,916 --> 00:57:18,041
from the equation
a bit at a time.

973
00:57:18,125 --> 00:57:19,750
What's the "Home Ministry"?

974
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:21,500
You mean you wanted
to be Prime Minister,

975
00:57:21,583 --> 00:57:24,166
and you don't even know that?

976
00:57:34,583 --> 00:57:35,666
Yes?

977
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:38,291
Hello... Takizawa?

978
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:40,458
Saki... Sorry...

979
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:43,208
I guess I never had a
good chance to call you.

980
00:57:43,291 --> 00:57:46,125
No, it's alright...
but listen...

981
00:57:46,208 --> 00:57:48,083
it's about your mother.

982
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:49,958
So how'd it go?

983
00:57:50,041 --> 00:57:51,500
I found her.

984
00:57:51,583 --> 00:57:54,416
The woman from Careless Monday.

985
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,166
You were right, she
really was your mom.

986
00:57:57,250 --> 00:58:00,083
She's operating
a bar in Mishuku.

987
00:58:00,166 --> 00:58:01,416
Really?

988
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,708
Yeah...

989
00:58:02,791 --> 00:58:06,083
Her name is Aya Iwashita...
and apparently...

990
00:58:06,166 --> 00:58:09,333
she was Prime
Minister Iinuma's lover back

991
00:58:09,416 --> 00:58:11,958
when he was still
just a Diet member.

992
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:14,125
Your hotel room in New York.

993
00:58:14,208 --> 00:58:15,708
You remember how you told me

994
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:17,666
it had been paid for all along?

995
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:19,416
Yeah.

996
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:22,000
I think that's where Aya stayed.

997
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:24,458
Twenty years ago or so.

998
00:58:24,541 --> 00:58:26,291
We saw a picture of her

999
00:58:26,375 --> 00:58:28,291
and Iinuma taken
together in New York;

1000
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:30,500
she was clearly pregnant.

1001
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:32,333
When you add it all up.

1002
00:58:32,416 --> 00:58:35,291
it looks like you really
are his son, Takizawa.

1003
00:59:08,041 --> 00:59:09,666
So that's what happened.

1004
00:59:13,125 --> 00:59:14,500
I guess that's why I had

1005
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:17,208
all those memories of
being in New York, too.

1006
00:59:17,958 --> 00:59:20,416
Listen... So where
are you right now?

1007
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,083
In front of the mansion...

1008
00:59:22,166 --> 00:59:25,166
I'm with Micchon and the others.

1009
00:59:31,625 --> 00:59:33,666
I see you... Look up.

1010
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:37,208
Yeah, I see you too.

1011
00:59:37,625 --> 00:59:40,458
It's good to know that I have
a past like anyone else.

1012
00:59:40,541 --> 00:59:42,458
And now I've at least
got a little better idea

1013
00:59:42,541 --> 00:59:45,000
of what my mother's like, right?

1014
00:59:45,083 --> 00:59:46,958
Thanks for that... Saki.

1015
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,583
It seems you've finally
recovered your past.

1016
01:00:00,666 --> 01:00:02,333
So... how does it feel?

1017
01:00:02,416 --> 01:00:04,958
Knowing that you really are
the Prime Minister's son?

1018
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:07,708
You knew? Of course you did.

1019
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:12,041
I dunno. Guess it
hasn't sunk in yet.

1020
01:00:12,125 --> 01:00:15,250
Well, then let's get back
to the business at hand.

1021
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:16,666
I will match the
remaining balance

1022
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:19,250
on your phone in cash,
as getaway money...

1023
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:21,708
You'll be free to go anywhere
in the world that you like.

1024
01:00:21,791 --> 01:00:24,458
I will ensure you remain
safe from the supporter...

1025
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:26,791
And I'll see to it
that your friends

1026
01:00:26,875 --> 01:00:28,416
are cleared of
suspicion as well.

1027
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,916
Given those terms,
would you agree

1028
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,958
to quietly walk away
and disappear?

1029
01:00:33,041 --> 01:00:36,000
Y'know, that might
not be so bad.

1030
01:00:39,125 --> 01:00:41,166
I just have one question though.

1031
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:43,541
You talk about
"the citizens of Japan"...

1032
01:00:43,625 --> 01:00:46,708
but you don't actually care
for them too much, do you?

1033
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:48,250
Do you have to ask?

1034
01:00:48,333 --> 01:00:50,750
The "citizens"
themselves are nothing

1035
01:00:50,833 --> 01:00:53,541
but a collection of parts
that serve the national whole.

1036
01:00:53,625 --> 01:00:55,291
It would be counterproductive

1037
01:00:55,375 --> 01:00:57,833
to have personal
feelings about them.

1038
01:00:57,916 --> 01:00:58,875
Yeah, but...

1039
01:00:58,958 --> 01:01:00,416
you can't deny that
each one of them

1040
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,541
is an individual person that's
just tryin' to be somebody.

1041
01:01:03,625 --> 01:01:05,833
Well, now you're
just being naïve.

1042
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:07,250
Whether they want it or not,

1043
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:08,916
it would be impossible
for all of them

1044
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,166
to get to "be somebody".

1045
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,375
True, but that doesn't
mean they can't try.

1046
01:01:13,458 --> 01:01:15,333
And doesn't putting faith
in them as individuals

1047
01:01:15,416 --> 01:01:16,875
give them even more incentive

1048
01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:19,666
to lift themselves up
and try harder?

1049
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:20,958
Take me for example,

1050
01:01:21,041 --> 01:01:22,333
if nobody had ever told me I was

1051
01:01:22,416 --> 01:01:24,791
one of the people
chosen to save Japan...

1052
01:01:24,875 --> 01:01:27,791
I doubt that I ever would've
accomplished this much.

1053
01:01:28,583 --> 01:01:30,000
It just seems your
way of doing things...

1054
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:31,666
it's a little bit lacking

1055
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:34,916
in the whole compassion
department... isn't it?

1056
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,875
So does all this
mean you've decided

1057
01:01:36,958 --> 01:01:39,333
to turn down my proposal?

1058
01:01:39,416 --> 01:01:40,875
Yeah, I guess it does.

1059
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:42,333
'Cause now I'm thinkin'...

1060
01:01:42,416 --> 01:01:44,250
I need a more direct approach.

1061
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:46,083
I'm just gonna have
to try playin' the part

1062
01:01:46,166 --> 01:01:48,166
of the terrorist one more time.

1063
01:01:49,541 --> 01:01:50,458
At first I thought becoming king

1064
01:01:50,541 --> 01:01:52,541
was the only way I could help.

1065
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:56,000
but there's plenty
of other ways... right?

1066
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:59,750
I can still be the man
who's got nothing to lose.

1067
01:01:59,833 --> 01:02:02,583
the crazy naked guy in
front of the White House.

1068
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,083
Juiz speaking.

1069
01:02:06,166 --> 01:02:07,416
Juiz...

1070
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,083
Is it possible to
set up a phone call

1071
01:02:09,166 --> 01:02:12,458
that goes out to every
citizen in Japan all at once?

1072
01:02:13,333 --> 01:02:14,750
The communications
fees associated

1073
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:17,333
with such a call
would be immense.

1074
01:02:17,416 --> 01:02:18,750
Depending on the length...

1075
01:02:18,833 --> 01:02:20,083
it's possible your balance

1076
01:02:20,166 --> 01:02:22,208
will reach zero
before you're finished.

1077
01:02:22,291 --> 01:02:24,000
Do you still wish to proceed?

1078
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:25,916
No, I guess that
wouldn't be too good.

1079
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,416
I need to make sure I have

1080
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,000
at least a hundred million
left in the account at the end.

1081
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:34,416
In that case, I may not
be able grant your request.

1082
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,041
I see...

1083
01:02:38,166 --> 01:02:40,916
Hold on...
I know what we can do!

1084
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:44,708
Tell me this much, at least.

1085
01:02:44,791 --> 01:02:47,458
When you asked Takizawa
how he'd spend ten billion.

1086
01:02:47,541 --> 01:02:49,708
What was his response?

1087
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:54,875
Actually, I never did
ask that boy that question.

1088
01:03:01,791 --> 01:03:03,458
Say, excuse me, son.

1089
01:03:03,541 --> 01:03:05,708
Could I get a paper, please?

1090
01:03:05,791 --> 01:03:08,083
Yeah! Sure!

1091
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,250
Nah, it's on me.

1092
01:03:16,333 --> 01:03:18,125
The only people who
ever ask for just one copy

1093
01:03:18,208 --> 01:03:19,791
are the ones who're
actually gonna read it.

1094
01:03:19,875 --> 01:03:21,166
Enjoy yourself.

1095
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:24,625
Are you sure?
That's bad business.

1096
01:03:24,708 --> 01:03:26,083
I'll make my money
from all the people

1097
01:03:26,166 --> 01:03:28,250
who subscribe
then never read it.

1098
01:03:28,333 --> 01:03:29,750
Although... they are the ones

1099
01:03:29,833 --> 01:03:32,500
who never seem to wanna
pay their bill on time.

1100
01:03:32,583 --> 01:03:34,541
That's very true.

1101
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:40,166
You seem a smart boy.

1102
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,375
What would even possess you

1103
01:03:41,458 --> 01:03:43,750
to take a paper route
in the first place?

1104
01:03:46,541 --> 01:03:49,458
You gotta' practice
earning money, right?

1105
01:03:53,791 --> 01:03:55,791
Most people got
it all backwards.

1106
01:03:55,875 --> 01:03:57,250
I mean, even a
five-year old kid can

1107
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,250
figure out how to spend
money, but it seems like

1108
01:03:59,333 --> 01:04:00,791
there's a lot of
grown adults out there

1109
01:04:00,875 --> 01:04:02,791
who never learn how to earn it.

1110
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:04,958
I guess 'cause spending
money feels a lot nicer

1111
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:07,291
than jumping through
someone else's hoops.

1112
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:09,250
"The customer is always right!".

1113
01:04:09,333 --> 01:04:10,333
People think that means

1114
01:04:10,416 --> 01:04:12,750
being a consumer
gives them real power.

1115
01:04:12,833 --> 01:04:14,083
But honestly,
that's just something

1116
01:04:14,166 --> 01:04:16,458
the seller's supposed
to say, isn't it?

1117
01:04:16,541 --> 01:04:18,750
Yes, true.

1118
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:20,125
And if we're all buyers,

1119
01:04:20,208 --> 01:04:22,125
who the heck's gonna
provide the services?

1120
01:04:22,208 --> 01:04:23,666
Seems like that's
the part most people

1121
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:25,208
don't bother to think about.

1122
01:04:27,166 --> 01:04:29,041
Personally, I think
it'd probably be healthier

1123
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:31,625
for society if people
thought that earning money

1124
01:04:31,708 --> 01:04:33,875
was more fun than
spending it away.

1125
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:38,166
I see.

1126
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:40,875
So that's the reason you
decided to make him a Seleção.

1127
01:04:43,541 --> 01:04:45,250
No. You were more
interested in how

1128
01:04:45,333 --> 01:04:46,875
he even came to that conclusion!

1129
01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:49,500
You just wanted
to figure him out!

1130
01:04:52,041 --> 01:04:53,833
I suppose our opinions
on what needs

1131
01:04:53,916 --> 01:04:56,250
to be done will
never mesh in the end.

1132
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:58,208
Really? 'Cause the way I see it,

1133
01:04:58,291 --> 01:05:01,541
we've both been looking in
the same direction all along.

1134
01:05:01,625 --> 01:05:04,083
You can do as you like.

1135
01:05:13,291 --> 01:05:15,000
Hello?

1136
01:05:15,875 --> 01:05:19,125
Um... Get this...

1137
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:21,125
It's a call directly from Juiz.

1138
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,666
What?

1139
01:05:23,416 --> 01:05:24,541
Juiz speaking.

1140
01:05:24,625 --> 01:05:26,583
I am calling at
Number Nine's request.

1141
01:05:26,666 --> 01:05:28,041
For Vintage Boy?

1142
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:29,375
Yes.

1143
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:31,708
He would like to use
the Air Ship application

1144
01:05:31,791 --> 01:05:33,875
you created to connect
all of the cell phones

1145
01:05:33,958 --> 01:05:36,208
in Japan to Eden of the East.

1146
01:05:36,291 --> 01:05:37,458
What the hell?

1147
01:05:37,541 --> 01:05:40,000
What's that crazy
bastard up to this time?

1148
01:06:07,458 --> 01:06:08,666
It's from Takky.

1149
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:11,208
Hey! Here it is!

1150
01:07:06,541 --> 01:07:08,875
Hello, and a good
morning to everyone...

1151
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:09,958
For those that don't know,

1152
01:07:10,041 --> 01:07:11,500
I'm the man behind
Careless Monday

1153
01:07:11,583 --> 01:07:13,500
and the other
recent terrorist attacks,

1154
01:07:13,583 --> 01:07:19,083
Akira Takizawa,
aka the Air King. Bang!

1155
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:21,708
I came home as Prime
Minister Iinuma's son

1156
01:07:21,791 --> 01:07:23,666
yesterday to
grab your attention.

1157
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:26,291
I gotta say, it worked
even better than I'd hoped...

1158
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:27,750
but the truth of it is,

1159
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:31,250
I have no actual relation
to our late Prime Minister.

1160
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:33,916
Before I do anything else,

1161
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,833
I'd like to offer
my sincere apologies

1162
01:07:35,916 --> 01:07:37,750
for all the trouble
I caused his family

1163
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:39,875
and friends these last few days.

1164
01:07:42,416 --> 01:07:44,375
Takky, what do you
think you're doing?

1165
01:07:44,458 --> 01:07:48,208
You're gonna throw all of Saki's
hard work right down the drain.

1166
01:07:50,083 --> 01:07:53,041
Now, to get to the
real reason I'm calling.

1167
01:07:53,125 --> 01:07:56,583
Listen up... because what
I'm about to announce is...

1168
01:07:56,666 --> 01:07:58,875
a new... terrorist attack.

1169
01:07:58,958 --> 01:08:00,375
Once again, I'm planning

1170
01:08:00,458 --> 01:08:02,583
to gather a giant crowd
of young people.

1171
01:08:02,666 --> 01:08:05,666
and then I'm gonna lead
them off to Paradise.

1172
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,791
I'm expecting a
lot more to show up

1173
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:09,458
this time than
the twenty-thousand

1174
01:08:09,541 --> 01:08:11,791
I took away six months ago.

1175
01:08:11,875 --> 01:08:13,541
What this means...

1176
01:08:13,625 --> 01:08:15,041
is that Japan is about to lose

1177
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:18,583
the workforce vital
to its future survival!

1178
01:08:18,666 --> 01:08:21,000
If you want to
avoid that outcome

1179
01:08:21,083 --> 01:08:25,083
your only option now is
to meet my demands in full.

1180
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,708
What's he doing playing
The Pied Piper of Hamelin again?

1181
01:08:28,791 --> 01:08:30,666
What could that possibly solve?

1182
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:34,541
There is only one way
that you can do this.

1183
01:08:34,625 --> 01:08:36,500
First, I want all you old guys

1184
01:08:36,583 --> 01:08:38,583
who take it for granted
you're the winners to promise

1185
01:08:38,666 --> 01:08:41,333
you'll give up everything you've
been hoarding all these years.

1186
01:08:41,416 --> 01:08:42,916
And then, I want you to join me

1187
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,708
and the other young
people of this nation

1188
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:47,958
as we set out
for a new Paradise!

1189
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:50,958
And there you have it,
that's my entire list.

1190
01:08:51,041 --> 01:08:55,041
If you fail to meet these
demands our nation's identity

1191
01:08:55,125 --> 01:08:57,541
and values will soon be lost...

1192
01:08:57,625 --> 01:09:01,291
and the paradise you envisioned
will be lost as well.

1193
01:09:01,375 --> 01:09:03,541
And listen--my previous
missile attacks?

1194
01:09:03,625 --> 01:09:06,375
They were just warm-ups
to prepare for today.

1195
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:08,875
If you choose to
ignore my demands,

1196
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:10,333
then I guarantee you something

1197
01:09:10,416 --> 01:09:12,958
even more terrible
will befall this country.

1198
01:09:13,041 --> 01:09:15,625
But, if you can do
what I've told you to do,

1199
01:09:15,708 --> 01:09:17,875
even a little bit.

1200
01:09:17,958 --> 01:09:21,625
then I'm sure that great things
are in store for all of us!

1201
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,958
So, before I sign
off this morning

1202
01:09:27,041 --> 01:09:30,541
I'll be sending each of you
one yen in electronic funds.

1203
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:33,875
Please consider this
my parting gift to you.

1204
01:09:33,958 --> 01:09:36,500
as well as a
promissory note proving

1205
01:09:36,583 --> 01:09:38,958
that everything
I've said today...

1206
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:41,041
it's all going to come true.

1207
01:09:44,125 --> 01:09:45,583
'Kay Juiz.

1208
01:09:45,666 --> 01:09:47,833
I think that's gonna do it,
but before I hang up for good.

1209
01:09:47,916 --> 01:09:52,000
Send one Yen to every
phone we're connected to.

1210
01:09:52,083 --> 01:09:54,250
Request accepted.

1211
01:09:54,333 --> 01:09:57,000
I sincerely pray you shall
continue to be a wise

1212
01:09:57,083 --> 01:09:59,458
and loving king,
who instills fear

1213
01:09:59,541 --> 01:10:02,875
and hope into the hearts
of all his subjects.

1214
01:10:22,583 --> 01:10:24,500
And now, to all you NEETs

1215
01:10:24,583 --> 01:10:27,208
who've been holding
sit-ins in your homes!

1216
01:10:27,291 --> 01:10:30,041
The time has come to stand up...

1217
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:31,958
My Air Ship is ready
to carry all of us

1218
01:10:32,041 --> 01:10:35,000
into the promised land,
Eden of the East.

1219
01:10:35,083 --> 01:10:36,458
I'll see you there.

1220
01:10:41,666 --> 01:10:43,375
What the hell's he playing at?

1221
01:10:43,458 --> 01:10:44,791
Does he really
think people are going

1222
01:10:44,875 --> 01:10:46,958
to go along with this,
just because he asked them to?

1223
01:10:48,208 --> 01:10:50,125
At one time, we worked like hell

1224
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:52,000
to do something
for this country,

1225
01:10:52,083 --> 01:10:54,458
something that we
all thought was great.

1226
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:57,041
Now... it's become a joke.

1227
01:10:57,125 --> 01:11:00,750
Now people call it 'a blemish
on our history', a 'mistake'.

1228
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:06,166
Granted, at the time,
we were a bunch of novices

1229
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:09,416
who didn't know up from
down or left from right.

1230
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:14,000
But I ask you--if
everything we built up

1231
01:11:14,083 --> 01:11:17,916
was wrong, then what
would have been right?

1232
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:22,916
Of course...

1233
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,166
just when we thought we'd
finally achieved something...

1234
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:27,625
the rules of the
game changed on us-

1235
01:11:27,708 --> 01:11:29,583
the whole damn world changed.

1236
01:11:29,666 --> 01:11:31,916
New ideas gained prominence.

1237
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,375
and increasing our country's
depth was no longer a priority.

1238
01:11:37,916 --> 01:11:39,416
It's harsh...

1239
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:42,166
telling the old guard like us
it's time to accept that fact...

1240
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:45,125
that he wants us to
give up our authority...

1241
01:11:45,208 --> 01:11:46,625
that it's time for the young...

1242
01:11:46,708 --> 01:11:48,791
to start leading the way.

1243
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:53,083
Men like Ryoma Sakamoto
and Jiro Shirasu.

1244
01:11:53,166 --> 01:11:55,541
They remain national
heroes to this day,

1245
01:11:55,625 --> 01:11:57,041
not only for the
things they did,

1246
01:11:57,125 --> 01:11:59,250
but because they were
good about drawing

1247
01:11:59,333 --> 01:12:01,625
the right kind of
attention to themselves.

1248
01:12:01,708 --> 01:12:05,833
But the true saviors of this
country are history's losers...

1249
01:12:05,916 --> 01:12:09,458
the nameless masses who
toil steadily every day...

1250
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:14,000
and leave this world tainted
by crushing losses as a result.

1251
01:12:14,083 --> 01:12:16,125
In a time when that
truth is all too often

1252
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:19,000
forgotten or
intentionally ignored.

1253
01:12:19,083 --> 01:12:21,625
Number Nine has gone
out on a limb for them.

1254
01:12:21,708 --> 01:12:23,916
and made himself
their scapegoat.

1255
01:12:25,083 --> 01:12:26,583
Fascinating.

1256
01:12:28,541 --> 01:12:29,750
I believe it's time...

1257
01:12:29,833 --> 01:12:32,375
to close the curtain
on this game.

1258
01:12:32,458 --> 01:12:34,416
The winner is clear.

1259
01:12:42,416 --> 01:12:43,666
That phone call...

1260
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:46,416
did that truly go out
to every person in Japan?

1261
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,250
Yeah. I think so.

1262
01:12:48,333 --> 01:12:51,416
I'm sorry again for
the trouble I caused you.

1263
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,750
I guess now I really do have
to go on the run as a terrorist.

1264
01:12:54,833 --> 01:12:56,041
so you can tell them
whatever you need

1265
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:58,166
to at the witness summons.

1266
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:00,083
I understand, thank you.

1267
01:13:00,166 --> 01:13:01,583
You go on, then.

1268
01:13:09,625 --> 01:13:11,625
Oh, and... take this.

1269
01:13:12,625 --> 01:13:15,083
I don't believe I need
to look at it now.

1270
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:24,500
You know...

1271
01:13:24,583 --> 01:13:27,458
he does remind me a bit
of Mister Iinuma in a way.

1272
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,833
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I shouldn't have said that.

1273
01:13:30,916 --> 01:13:32,125
It's fine.

1274
01:13:32,208 --> 01:13:34,291
If that's what you
see in him, then...

1275
01:13:34,375 --> 01:13:36,166
I don't mind.

1276
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:43,375
Your methods are every bit
as drastic as I'd expect...

1277
01:13:43,458 --> 01:13:45,750
However, the people of Japan

1278
01:13:45,833 --> 01:13:48,875
are an astonishingly
cynical lot.

1279
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,916
If you expect to
get what you want

1280
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,125
from them so easily,

1281
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:54,208
you're bound for disappointment.

1282
01:13:54,291 --> 01:13:56,833
Well, I guess I just give
'em more credit than that.

1283
01:13:56,916 --> 01:13:59,083
And I'm just giving
you the facts.

1284
01:14:07,333 --> 01:14:08,791
What is this?

1285
01:14:13,166 --> 01:14:15,750
Greetings, Seleção...

1286
01:14:15,833 --> 01:14:18,083
This is Mister Outside.

1287
01:14:19,166 --> 01:14:21,750
I realize this comes
as sudden news,

1288
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:23,458
but at the end of
this phone call,

1289
01:14:23,541 --> 01:14:25,916
our game will be concluded.

1290
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,416
Overall, I am satisfied

1291
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,458
with the results
of your actions.

1292
01:14:29,541 --> 01:14:30,791
Therefore,...

1293
01:14:30,875 --> 01:14:34,458
I have decided to declare
you all... as victors.

1294
01:14:34,541 --> 01:14:35,791
Though our game is ending,

1295
01:14:35,875 --> 01:14:38,250
I count on you to be people
who will steer Japan

1296
01:14:38,333 --> 01:14:40,833
in a better direction
from this day forward.

1297
01:14:40,916 --> 01:14:42,208
"From this day forward"--

1298
01:14:42,291 --> 01:14:44,708
c'mon man, I've
always done that.

1299
01:14:46,833 --> 01:14:48,291
And...

1300
01:14:48,375 --> 01:14:51,708
Finally... as a token of my
thanks for your participation.

1301
01:14:51,791 --> 01:14:55,333
I offer you the
greatest of gifts.

1302
01:14:55,416 --> 01:14:57,916
I very much hope
you appreciate it.

1303
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,500
It's something I've had prepared

1304
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:02,250
from the very beginning,
as an exclusive bonus

1305
01:15:02,333 --> 01:15:05,958
for the Seleção who
proved themselves worthy.

1306
01:15:07,833 --> 01:15:10,083
Noblesse oblige.

1307
01:15:11,666 --> 01:15:12,958
Farewell...

1308
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:14,833
I sincerely pray
you shall continue

1309
01:15:14,916 --> 01:15:17,875
to be this country's
latent saviors.

1310
01:15:17,958 --> 01:15:19,708
Latent saviors?

1311
01:15:32,583 --> 01:15:33,666
Well, hey there, beautiful.

1312
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:35,708
Now why you all
shakin' like that.

1313
01:15:35,791 --> 01:15:37,500
ya' ain't hungry, are ya?

1314
01:15:38,625 --> 01:15:40,958
You can lick on
my lollipop, suga'.

1315
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:47,416
Yahh! Oh shit.

1316
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,833
Someone help! Who am I?

1317
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Thank you, so much. Dear Saizo.

1318
01:16:10,083 --> 01:16:12,750
Take care.

1319
01:16:28,666 --> 01:16:31,750
So what was it? This "present"?

1320
01:16:31,833 --> 01:16:34,083
When I delivered
the cell phones...

1321
01:16:34,166 --> 01:16:36,291
I took the added
liberty of planting

1322
01:16:36,375 --> 01:16:39,333
a little something
in here as well.

1323
01:16:39,416 --> 01:16:40,708
And now they will forever

1324
01:16:40,791 --> 01:16:43,416
and truly be released
from the game.

1325
01:16:45,625 --> 01:16:46,416
Why, you!

1326
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:47,666
How much of their lives

1327
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:49,875
do you have to take away
before you're satisfied?

1328
01:16:53,291 --> 01:16:57,958
I'm not so old yet that I'd
lose to a milksop like you.

1329
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:43,875
Takky!

1330
01:17:43,958 --> 01:17:45,416
Takizawa!

1331
01:17:48,625 --> 01:17:49,791
Hey, what's the matter with you?

1332
01:17:49,875 --> 01:17:51,541
Are you feelin' alright?

1333
01:18:09,416 --> 01:18:10,750
Yes, hello, excuse me.

1334
01:18:10,833 --> 01:18:13,875
I was told I could find
a man named Takizawa here.

1335
01:18:13,958 --> 01:18:15,208
Is that correct?

1336
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,750
Mononobe?

1337
01:18:18,833 --> 01:18:20,541
Sorry, should I know you?

1338
01:18:20,625 --> 01:18:22,875
Now If you don't mind,
I'm in a hurry.

1339
01:18:24,083 --> 01:18:26,083
You act like you
don't even know me.

1340
01:18:26,166 --> 01:18:28,375
After everything
that I've done for you?

1341
01:18:56,708 --> 01:18:59,708
So, did I get away without
hearing that weird noise

1342
01:18:59,791 --> 01:19:02,708
because I'd already
erased my memory?

1343
01:19:02,791 --> 01:19:06,041
What are you worrying
about that for, Takky?

1344
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:08,791
Right now, everyone in Japan
thinks you're a terrorist!

1345
01:19:10,875 --> 01:19:13,208
Yeah, well. I'm sure
it'll all work out.

1346
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,833
I thought your message
was really brave.

1347
01:19:18,916 --> 01:19:20,875
I know they'll hear you.

1348
01:19:20,958 --> 01:19:23,208
Thanks, Saki. Really.

1349
01:19:29,125 --> 01:19:32,250
I wonder if my mom was
out there listening, too.

1350
01:19:46,375 --> 01:19:47,833
You gotta be kidding!

1351
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:50,291
Well, you have to
give her this much.

1352
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:53,041
Ol' Mom was a real free spirit.

1353
01:19:57,875 --> 01:19:59,125
What?

1354
01:19:59,208 --> 01:20:01,375
Wait, so now you're not
even the PM's bastard kid?

1355
01:20:01,458 --> 01:20:02,500
Come on!

1356
01:20:02,583 --> 01:20:04,541
Guess not...

1357
01:20:04,625 --> 01:20:06,041
But... that's alright;

1358
01:20:06,125 --> 01:20:08,791
I know it'll be a lot less
trouble for Chigusa that way.

1359
01:20:08,875 --> 01:20:10,333
Sure... Nice.

1360
01:20:10,416 --> 01:20:13,500
But now, that terrorist
label is really gonna stick!

1361
01:20:13,583 --> 01:20:15,583
I mean, this was your only out.

1362
01:20:15,666 --> 01:20:17,000
Yeah, she's right!

1363
01:20:17,083 --> 01:20:20,458
The whole damn country's
gonna be after your head now.

1364
01:20:20,541 --> 01:20:22,500
You gotta point there...

1365
01:20:25,583 --> 01:20:28,250
And on that note.
Guess I'll be goin'.

1366
01:20:29,625 --> 01:20:31,625
What? Just like that?

1367
01:20:31,708 --> 01:20:33,291
So after everything
Saki went through

1368
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:34,666
to get back to you.

1369
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:36,833
Now you're just gonna take off?

1370
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:40,375
Takizawa. Listen, I...

1371
01:20:40,458 --> 01:20:43,916
I'm sorry. I have to go...

1372
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,333
I remembered that
there's one last thing

1373
01:20:45,416 --> 01:20:48,791
I really have to do before
I can call this game over.

1374
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:50,958
If you can wait, once
I've got that out of the way,

1375
01:20:51,041 --> 01:20:53,375
I promise I'll come back to you.

1376
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,125
See ya'.

1377
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:01,125
Oh, and Hirasawa,
Panties, and Kasuga...

1378
01:21:01,208 --> 01:21:03,500
tell all of them
I said thanks, too!

1379
01:21:40,541 --> 01:21:42,791
You'd better come back, okay?

1380
01:21:42,875 --> 01:21:44,416
You promised me.

1381
01:21:45,291 --> 01:21:48,583
I did. And I definitely will.

1382
01:22:07,958 --> 01:22:09,375
So far...

1383
01:22:09,458 --> 01:22:12,958
that morning was the last we'd
seen or heard of Takizawa.

1384
01:22:15,041 --> 01:22:18,625
Apparently... after he
made his terrorist threat...

1385
01:22:18,708 --> 01:22:20,833
the Seleção game ended,

1386
01:22:20,916 --> 01:22:22,875
which meant his
request to become king

1387
01:22:22,958 --> 01:22:24,750
was canceled as well.

1388
01:22:27,166 --> 01:22:28,916
As far as the
public was concerned,

1389
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,416
he vanished just as
suddenly as he'd appeared.

1390
01:22:34,583 --> 01:22:35,708
But still...

1391
01:22:35,791 --> 01:22:37,083
there were more
than a few people

1392
01:22:37,166 --> 01:22:38,416
who would have been happy

1393
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,416
to see him crowned all the same.

1394
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,458
Like Chigusa.

1395
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:45,875
Takizawa and the Prime Minister
weren't related by blood.

1396
01:22:45,958 --> 01:22:47,375
but in the course of her short

1397
01:22:47,458 --> 01:22:49,500
yet intense
involvement with him...

1398
01:22:49,583 --> 01:22:51,500
she sensed the same
fire in his blood

1399
01:22:51,583 --> 01:22:53,250
that had burned
in her husband's.

1400
01:22:57,916 --> 01:22:59,291
And Aya...

1401
01:22:59,375 --> 01:23:02,458
After her tacit admission
that Takizawa was her son...

1402
01:23:02,541 --> 01:23:04,458
she ran off again...

1403
01:23:04,541 --> 01:23:07,875
but this time, she remembered
to bring her mini Shiba.

1404
01:23:07,958 --> 01:23:10,041
I think she must
have circumstances

1405
01:23:10,125 --> 01:23:13,375
she can't tell anyone about,
but it's clear she intends

1406
01:23:13,458 --> 01:23:16,750
to keep the secrets of
Takizawa's birth for life.

1407
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:30,583
As for the NEETs that
answered Takizawa's call.

1408
01:23:30,666 --> 01:23:33,333
they joined the
AKX20000 in the mall--

1409
01:23:33,416 --> 01:23:36,958
which is basically revered as
a holy land at this point--

1410
01:23:37,041 --> 01:23:39,250
and started living
a communal life,

1411
01:23:39,333 --> 01:23:42,166
supported by a
perpetual flea market.

1412
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:43,541
Unfortunately.

1413
01:23:43,625 --> 01:23:46,833
Takizawa never came to
take them all to paradise.

1414
01:23:46,916 --> 01:23:49,750
but even though they're
furious at the Air King,

1415
01:23:49,833 --> 01:23:51,333
at the same time,

1416
01:23:51,416 --> 01:23:53,583
they're eagerly awaiting
his second coming.

1417
01:23:53,666 --> 01:23:55,250
And then, of course,

1418
01:23:55,333 --> 01:23:57,375
there were the old guys
who'd been given the ultimatum.

1419
01:23:57,458 --> 01:24:00,458
At first, some companies
came for the NEETs,

1420
01:24:00,541 --> 01:24:02,375
in accordance with
Takizawa's demands,

1421
01:24:02,458 --> 01:24:04,166
and announced that they'd
be taking a fresh look

1422
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:08,583
at their hiring practices,
but that didn't last long.

1423
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,916
Even so, the thousands of NEETs

1424
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
who installed
themselves in Toyosu

1425
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:16,750
and made it their
"Paradise" started creating

1426
01:24:16,833 --> 01:24:19,208
their own economic
opportunities,

1427
01:24:19,291 --> 01:24:22,208
and are now helping Japan
recover little by little.

1428
01:24:24,208 --> 01:24:25,458
Last but not least,

1429
01:24:25,541 --> 01:24:27,416
if you're wondering
what happened to us...

1430
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:30,958
well... the bad publicity
we got as a 'terrorist site'

1431
01:24:31,041 --> 01:24:32,791
was too much to overcome,

1432
01:24:32,875 --> 01:24:36,250
so Eden closed its doors as
a company for the time being.

1433
01:24:36,333 --> 01:24:39,875
Since then, at Hirasawa
and Itazu's suggestion,

1434
01:24:39,958 --> 01:24:41,791
we've relocated to
Toyosu and joined

1435
01:24:41,875 --> 01:24:43,625
in the NEETs communal lifestyle,

1436
01:24:43,708 --> 01:24:45,166
where we've been
working to develop

1437
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:48,083
an even more user-friendly
system for the future.

1438
01:24:51,916 --> 01:24:54,375
It's been six
months since that day

1439
01:24:54,458 --> 01:24:55,958
and as far as I can tell,...

1440
01:24:56,041 --> 01:24:58,291
Japan doesn't seem to
have changed all that much

1441
01:24:58,375 --> 01:24:59,458
on the surface.

1442
01:25:01,541 --> 01:25:04,958
But underneath...
maybe just out of sight...

1443
01:25:05,041 --> 01:25:08,041
it feels like some real
change is on the way.

1444
01:25:08,125 --> 01:25:09,750
I believe that it is.

1445
01:25:19,583 --> 01:25:21,208
And wherever he may be,

1446
01:25:21,291 --> 01:25:24,291
out there dashing around
the city on his own,...

1447
01:25:24,375 --> 01:25:28,291
I know that Takizawa still
believes the same thing...

1448
01:25:34,875 --> 01:25:36,416
...and I know that
he's still carrying

1449
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:39,416
all of our hopes and
dreams on his shoulders.

1450
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:30,958
A question for you.

1451
01:30:31,041 --> 01:30:33,583
If a stranger handed
you ten billion yen

1452
01:30:33,666 --> 01:30:35,625
then said "improve
this country"...

1453
01:30:35,708 --> 01:30:37,250
What would you do?

1454
01:30:37,333 --> 01:30:39,375
How would you answer him?

1455
01:30:39,791 --> 01:30:42,250
Sounds like you're still
up to your old tricks.

1456
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:49,208
I finally found you.
Hello, Mister Outside.

1457
01:30:58,208 --> 01:31:00,416
I'm sorry... but who are you?

1458
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:02,583
What? No...

1459
01:31:02,666 --> 01:31:04,958
Don't you dare go
senile on me now.

1460
01:31:05,041 --> 01:31:06,333
You said if I won,

1461
01:31:06,416 --> 01:31:08,791
then I'd automatically
get to see you face to face.

1462
01:31:08,875 --> 01:31:10,958
You could at least
keep your promises!

1463
01:31:24,583 --> 01:31:26,583
Well... I feel better.

1464
01:31:26,666 --> 01:31:29,625
So let's just say that
makes us even, alright?

1465
01:31:29,708 --> 01:31:31,958
Alright... Then as long
as we're startin' over,

1466
01:31:32,041 --> 01:31:34,500
I've got a lot of favors
to ask you, old man.

1467
01:31:34,583 --> 01:31:35,791
For starters, could you take

1468
01:31:35,875 --> 01:31:37,875
a right up at the
next intersection?

1469
01:31:37,958 --> 01:31:39,375
And step on it.

1470
01:31:40,375 --> 01:31:42,666
We still have a hell of a
lot more work we gotta do--

1471
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:44,916
so no time for
this senile stuff!

1472
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,125
Keep it together, I mean it.

1473
01:31:52,375 --> 01:31:55,333
This is the story
of Takizawa and me.

1474
01:31:55,416 --> 01:31:57,791
The story of just eleven days.
