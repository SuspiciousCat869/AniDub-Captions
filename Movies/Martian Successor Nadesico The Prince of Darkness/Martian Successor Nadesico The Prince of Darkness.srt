1
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,029
‐ [Ruri] There are as many
people as there are stars.

2
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:35,447
And there are also
as many encounters.

3
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,746
Likewise, there are
as many farewells.

4
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:46,836
‐ I must be going now, Yurika.

5
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,720
I hope you and Akito are
getting along, Yurika.

6
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,471
(dramatic music)

7
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,886
‐ [Radio Operator] Yamabuki
Platoon, give Blue some backup!

8
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,315
‐ [Yamabuki Pilot]
Roger, will do.

9
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,814
‐ [Radio Operator] The first
and second defense lines,

10
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,055
they’ve been breached!

11
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,818
(screaming)

12
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,569
‐ Orange and Vermilion,
stay at present position!

13
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:08,691
Red, pull back to
Point Alpha now!

14
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:09,897
‐ Damn!

15
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:14,238
(guns firing)
(electronic whirring)

16
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,284
(scientist groaning)

17
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,409
‐ But if you kill us,
then who will be left

18
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:18,696
to interpret the research?

19
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,117
‐ Hmm, secrecy.

20
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,208
(weapon firing)

21
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,251
(pilot whimpering)
‐ Purple Eye, fall back!

22
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:27,463
Fall back, fall back!
(pilot screaming)

23
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,588
‐ A belated visit for revenge.

24
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:29,843
How callow.

25
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,185
Vanish.

26
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,140
(explosion booming)

27
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,938
‐ Shirahime, Shirahime,
please respond!

28
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,101
Shirahime, Shirahime,
please respond, do you copy?

29
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,017
‐ Our first priority
is the injured.

30
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,815
Raise the field and approach.

31
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,480
(alarm blaring)
‐ Bose particles rising!

32
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,439
‐ What?

33
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,778
(electronic warbling)

34
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,449
Change the sensor.

35
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:56,704
‐ Yes, sir.

36
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,453
(electronic warbling)
‐ What, huh?

37
00:01:59,536 --> 00:01:59,866
What is that?

38
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,711
What is this?

39
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,790
(dramatic music)

40
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,470
‐ The United Earth
has called for

41
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:21,767
the emergency General Assembly
to be convened in an‐‐

42
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,440
(fighting game characters
yelling and shouting)

43
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,559
‐ Shit!
‐ Did ya hear?

44
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:26,476
‐ Huh?

45
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:27,695
‐ Yeah, it’s totally true.

46
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,484
‐ Of course, it’s all just talk.

47
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,857
‐ And then, it cursed them!

48
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,316
(girls screaming)

49
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,487
‐ A ghost?

50
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:37,375
Robot?

51
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,373
(upbeat operatic music)

52
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,170
‐ [Announcer] The Hisago Plan!

53
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,500
‐ The Hisago Plan Space
Network is in trouble.

54
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,759
Four of its colonies have
been methodically destroyed,

55
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,879
one after another.

56
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,047
Four in a row!

57
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:55,965
Why?

58
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,641
Who’s doing it and how?

59
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,929
This cannot be tolerated!

60
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,063
‐ We’re not going with Saturn
Lizards this time, are we?

61
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,273
‐ Hmm?

62
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,981
And just what’s that
supposed to mean?

63
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:09,441
‐ Sources suggest a conspiracy
involving a certain nation.

64
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,573
‐ Our sources suggest
conspiracy too, lizard breath!

65
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,573
‐ What was that?

66
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,614
Meet me outside!
(man growling)

67
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,356
‐ This is war!
(all shouting)

68
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,200
‐ [Man] Gentlemen, order!

69
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,623
‐ And that was the
scene from the floor

70
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,542
of the United Earth
General Assembly.

71
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,162
‐ I saw it clearly.

72
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,497
What I saw was a boson jump.

73
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,462
‐ But we have reports indicating
the explosion of the colony

74
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,554
was wreaking havoc on the
sensors of all nearby ships.

75
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,510
‐ [Jun] You’re saying my
observation was mistaken?

76
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,800
‐ Exactly that.

77
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,053
‐ Think about it.

78
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:41,105
Neither the Earth nor
the Jovian Federation

79
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,891
has the technology to
build an eight meter Mecha

80
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,894
capable of boson jumping.

81
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:46,886
‐ [Jun] Damn it!

82
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,898
‐ There’s no need for that.

83
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,980
‐ I don’t think the Accidents
Investigations Committee

84
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,154
has the brainpower to
figure this thing out.

85
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,993
‐ And so the UE Space Fleet
is again left out in the cold,

86
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,609
leaving matters in the hands
of the Investigations Committee

87
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,199
and the United Forces.

88
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:00,742
‐ [Jun] Admiral?

89
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,236
(laughing)

90
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,115
‐ Well, I suppose
we can’t just sit

91
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,584
and watch everything happen,

92
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:09,754
so I’ve taken the liberty
of dispatching the Nadesico.

93
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,583
‐ Nadesico?

94
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,289
(heroic music)

95
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,218
‐ [Ruri] Hello there.

96
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,435
‐ [Women] Sabu!

97
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,152
‐ [Woman] I haven’t heard
from you in quite some time.

98
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,192
‐ [Women] Please call me!

99
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,733
(Saburota laughing)
‐ Hey, Sabu!

100
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:36,857
I don’t know who
you think you are,

101
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,403
but if you’re messing
around with other girls,

102
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,447
I swear to you I will make
you pay in so many ways,

103
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,530
you’ll never be able to
use the bathroom again!

104
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:44,782
‐ [Woman] This
concludes your messages.

105
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,700
‐ You must think you’re
God’s gift to women.

106
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,197
‐ Ah, were you listening?

107
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,458
‐ The entire crew could hear it.

108
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:51,792
‐ Ah, well, right.

109
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:52,925
‐ So tell me, I was
under the impression

110
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,631
that the Jovian
Federation officers

111
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,422
were all very noble and gallant.

112
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:01,466
‐ Well, I do appreciate
your appreciation of me.

113
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,933
‐ Oh, shut up!

114
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,761
‐ Confirming jump gate
Colony Takiri dead ahead.

115
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,517
(heroic music)

116
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,239
‐ [Saburota] Increasing
distortion field
to maximum power.

117
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,615
‐ [Harry] Confirming route.

118
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,951
Takiri to Sayori to Tagitsu,
arriving, Amaterasu.

119
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,054
Raise optical barrier.

120
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,631
‐ [Ruri] All hands commence
final check procedure.

121
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,884
‐ [Female Technician] Closing
all communications links.

122
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,428
Living quarters ready for jump.

123
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,010
‐ [Female Technician] Energy
systems are clear to go.

124
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,185
‐ [Female Technician] Ship
alert status, pattern B.

125
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,925
‐ [Harry] No abnormalities
in field output.

126
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,675
All else checks out A‐OK.

127
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,057
(dinging)

128
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,693
Fermion to boson conversion
proceeding normally.

129
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,864
All decks, condition green.

130
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,654
Increasing intensity level.

131
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:04,605
Six, seven, eight, nine.

132
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:05,488
‐ Okay.

133
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,576
‐ Ladies and gents, welcome
to jump gate Amaterasu.

134
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,918
‐ This is experimental
battleship Nadesico‐B

135
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,633
of United Earth Space Fleet.

136
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,422
We are making request for
navigational assistance

137
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:22,878
to the Amaterasu.

138
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,718
‐ Acknowledged.
‐ Ah, I guess it’s all work

139
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:25,763
from here on out.

140
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,006
‐ Shut it, Saburota!

141
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,022
‐ [Ruri] Navigation system,
connect to Amaterasu.

142
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,653
Requesting guidance for
parking and docking.

143
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,231
‐ [Gate Attendant] Acknowledged.

144
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,902
‐ Who the hell are you?

145
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:47,617
‐ Lieutenant Commander Ruri
Hoshino, United Space Fleet.

146
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:51,241
‐ Lieutenant Saburota
Takasugi of the UESF as well.

147
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,749
‐ Ah, well, ain’t that
just freakin’ perfect?

148
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,752
Why are you jackasses here?

149
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,672
‐ [Ruri] Sir, I am not aware
of any issues that would arise

150
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,132
from the UESF entering
into any UE properties.

151
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,094
‐ This is the core
of the Hisago Plan!

152
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,843
Did you get permission
from the corporation?

153
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,386
‐ No, we just love you.

154
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,549
‐ What?

155
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,677
‐ Uh, no, that’s just
his foreign tongue.

156
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,314
A dialect. (chuckling)

157
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,482
‐ A highly irregular
increase in bosons

158
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,561
were reported in the
latest Shirahime Incident.

159
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,476
If there are any problems
with the management

160
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,146
of the jump system, any
adjacent navigation routes

161
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,395
and colonies would be affected.

162
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,446
The emergency inspection clause
of Colony Administration law

163
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,740
can be applied here,
so please understand.

164
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,084
‐ Yeah, just think of it as
sort of a plumbing inspection.

165
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,790
‐ Nothing is wrong
with the Plan!

166
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,003
‐ Rear Admiral, sir.

167
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,712
Protecting the peace
of greater space

168
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,632
is the stated mission of
our dear UE Space Fleet.

169
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,753
Let us have faith in
the Commander’s passion

170
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,468
towards fulfilling that duty.

171
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,224
(laughing)

172
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,721
‐ Hello, everyone!

173
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,723
‐ [Children] Hello!

174
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,895
‐ [Mayumi] Welcome to your
tour of the Hisago Plan,

175
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,144
the transportation network
of the future: boson jumping!

176
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,897
I’m Mayumi and
I’ll be your guide,

177
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,309
along with my friend, Hisagon.

178
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,438
‐ Hello!

179
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,823
‐ And today, we have
a special guest.

180
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,109
We will be touring this
facility accompanied by

181
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,193
none other than‐‐

182
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,699
‐ You guessed it!

183
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,821
‐ The youngest ever captain
and beautiful child prodigy,

184
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,736
Lieutenant Commander
Ruri Hoshino

185
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,375
of the United Earth Space Fleet!

186
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,413
‐ I’m thrilled.
(children laughing)

187
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,205
(laughing)

188
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,830
‐ I hope she’s enjoying her
little diaper inspection.

189
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:20,878
What a shithole!

190
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,341
(both laughing)

191
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,171
‐ I have to say, I
feel a little guilty

192
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,006
making her go
through all of this.

193
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,550
I’m sure Space Fleet Command

194
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,515
feels the need to save face
regarding the latest incidents.

195
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,354
‐ They have no
face left to save,

196
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,261
or any business being here.

197
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,768
‐ It’s public relations,
for Space Fleet, I mean.

198
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,141
She’s nothing more than
a child on an errand.

199
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,188
‐ Well then, let’s get
the runt home soon.

200
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:50,201
(electronic warbling)

201
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:54,741
‐ Hmm, all sectors
clear up to 1001.

202
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,408
Are you ready to move on?

203
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,079
Data search, tofu soup pack.

204
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,866
Relay the soups to
me once they’re done

205
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,920
and keep them coming.

206
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,713
I want one after the other and‐‐

207
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,674
‐ Hey!

208
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:06,504
(Harry screaming)

209
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,128
‐ [Both] Huh?

210
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,973
(giggling)

211
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,219
‐ [Saburota]
(chuckles) Whoa, sorry.

212
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,430
I didn’t mean to scare ya.

213
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,051
‐ [Harry] Please, do
not enter my window bulb

214
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,257
without asking me first!

215
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,678
‐ [Saburota] Oh come
on, we’re not strangers,

216
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:18,676
we can both fit.

217
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:19,477
‐ What?

218
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,349
Back off me you sex maniac!

219
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,806
(sighing)

220
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,358
I don’t think I should
be doing this anyway.

221
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,151
‐ Man, you’re just one
mood swing after another.

222
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,395
‐ Hacking into their
system is crazy.

223
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,858
Not to mention
completely unethical.

224
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,068
‐ What else can we do?

225
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,580
Both the Investigations
Committee

226
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,041
and the Unified Forces
are hiding something.

227
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,330
‐ Yeah, but, it isn’t really
very fair to our captain.

228
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,377
‐ Aw, is this
sharp‐tongued little mouth

229
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,380
getting all soft
and squishy on me?

230
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,173
(chuckles) How sweet.

231
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,796
Look, the captain’s
been kind enough

232
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,935
to play the role of
the fool for a while.

233
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,600
Let’s use this opportunity to
find out as much as we can.

234
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,182
‐ Okay.

235
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,265
‐ [Mayumi] And that
should just about cover it

236
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,060
on the subject of super
symmetry and such.

237
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,814
‐ [Hisagon] Uh, any questions?

238
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,898
(children shouting)

239
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,151
‐ Okay, kids, listen carefully.

240
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,944
By going through these Chulips,

241
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,816
we will make traveling,
such as long distances,

242
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,656
like between Earth and
Mars quick as a flash!

243
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:16,452
(loud popping)

244
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,373
(children oohing and ahhing)

245
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,121
But currently, normal
humans are not able

246
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,703
to use this system.

247
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,208
In fact, in order for a person
like yourselves to use it,

248
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,460
you would have to
undergo a few, well,

249
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,004
genetic alterations,
shall we say?

250
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,759
‐ You mean re‐engineered?

251
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,259
‐ [Children] Huh?

252
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,970
‐ [Mayumi] Well, it’s not
like they do that much.

253
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,091
They just sort of use your DNA‐‐

254
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,137
‐ This was on TV,
saying that it was,

255
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,142
like, inhumane and stuff.

256
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,564
‐ Whoa.

257
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,020
‐ Please don’t be
over‐sensitive on my account.

258
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:43,983
‐ Oh!
‐ Oh!

259
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,560
‐ Okay, so at this point,

260
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,395
for a regular person to
boson jump on their own,

261
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,231
they would have to have their
DNA altered a little bit.

262
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,527
‐ [Children] Huh?

263
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,202
‐ So have you been
re‐engineered?

264
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,530
‐ Yes.
‐ Ah!

265
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,235
‐ This is so wicked awesome!

266
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,123
‐ And actually, if
using a powerful enough
distortion field,

267
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:05,212
a normal person can survive
a boson jump, like on a ship.

268
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,921
(electricity crackling)

269
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,341
‐ [Gate Attendant] Welcome
to jump gate Amaterasu.

270
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,051
(electronic blips ringing)

271
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,672
‐ Okay, h‐here we go.

272
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,798
There are entire sections
not listed in the blueprints.

273
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,355
‐ Guess there’s a reason for
these readings after all.

274
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,469
Okey‐dokey then, what
else you got for me?

275
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:24,886
(electronic blips ringing)

276
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,228
‐ What?

277
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,692
Human experiments
in boson jumping?

278
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,770
This stuff is all unsanctioned.

279
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,686
‐ Hey, hold on a second.

280
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,824
(alarm ringing)
‐ Huh, are we caught?

281
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:34,862
Release mode!

282
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,114
Omoikane, data block now!

283
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,657
Guide intruding
program to bypass.

284
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:40,531
‐ What?

285
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:42,826
What the hell is this?

286
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:47,964
‐ Welcome to jump
gate Amaterasu.

287
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,211
Welcome to jump gate Amaterasu.

288
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,635
Welcome to jump gate Amaterasu.

289
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,262
Welcome to jump gate Amaterasu.

290
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,300
‐ What’s going on?

291
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,882
Get this under
control, right now!

292
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,428
We are defenseless!

293
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:02,386
‐ Yes!

294
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,562
Uh, uh, yes sir!

295
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,890
We’re doing the best we can,

296
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,024
we’re trying to get
everything fixed up!

297
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,231
Shit!

298
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,151
Uh, uh, nothing, sir!

299
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,230
‐ [Woman] Remain calm.

300
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:14,146
Everyone, please, remain calm.

301
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,744
‐ No, the windows are harmless.

302
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,778
‐ Uh, calm down!

303
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,244
Please calm down!

304
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,662
Hey, don’t touch that,
please, children!

305
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,241
‐ Did you blow it, Harry?

306
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,908
‐ I swear it wasn’t me.

307
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,754
Amaterasu’s computers seem
to be fighting themselves.

308
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,000
‐ Fighting?

309
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,582
‐ That’s it exactly,
it’s the strangest thing.

310
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,417
We’ve detected an
unofficial system

311
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,753
embedded within Amaterasu.

312
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,166
And it looks like
this unknown system

313
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,756
is now revealing its presence.

314
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,802
It’s like its
laughing or something.

315
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:40,926
It’s a huge mess!

316
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:42,598
(Ruri gasping)

317
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,929
‐ Captain, where are you going?

318
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:45,766
W‐wait for me!

319
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,018
Captain!

320
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,890
Captain!

321
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,101
Captain, please
hold on a second!

322
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,940
Where are you going?

323
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:54,903
‐ Back to the Nadesico.

324
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,113
‐ Huh?
‐ The enemy will be here soon.

325
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,115
‐ Wha?

326
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,736
(dramatic music)

327
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,702
‐ Increased reading
of Bose particles!

328
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,248
Target cannot be identified!

329
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,619
He’s not responding to hails!

330
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:16,997
(chuckling)

331
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,300
‐ Hey guys, excuse me!
(children shouting)

332
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,552
Coming through!
‐ I do appreciate this.

333
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,715
‐ It’s my pleasure!

334
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,934
Besides, don’t you
love this action stuff?

335
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,179
‐ [Ruri Voiceover] My
premonition was correct.

336
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,980
The enemy came.

337
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,523
Was it a code?

338
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,516
A coincidence?

339
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,271
But he, but they were both‐‐

340
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,068
‐ Ruri!

341
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,941
(Ruri gasping)

342
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,608
(alarm blaring)

343
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,697
(rockets exploding)

344
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,674
(lasers blasting)

345
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,080
‐ [Man] Keep it away
from the Colony.

346
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,588
Lay out some cover fire.

347
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,499
‐ You can’t make an omelet
without breaking some eggs!

348
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,969
‐ Wha‐what are you
talking about, Admiral?

349
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,180
‐ I’m hereby permitting
the use of firepower

350
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,852
in and around the Colony.

351
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,180
‐ What?

352
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,105
But sir, that will put the
Colony in serious jeopardy!

353
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,022
‐ You must lose a small
fish to catch the big one.

354
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:15,193
Better to swat a mosquito on
your arm than one still in‐‐

355
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,443
‐ Enough!
‐ Huh?

356
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:20,152
(explosions booming)
(engine roaring)

357
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,444
‐ Time to move, dirtbags!

358
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,437
‐ [Pilots] Aye!

359
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,568
(dramatic music)

360
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,661
‐ Sucker!

361
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,419
‐ [Pilot] You all
right, can you move?

362
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,003
‐ [Pilot] Just go away.

363
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,167
‐ Huh?
‐ Sorry!

364
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,053
‐ Sorry I’m late.

365
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,891
Set the Nadesico into combat
mode and then stand by.

366
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,394
We will monitor the
situation for now.

367
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,565
‐ Then we’re not going
to join the fight?

368
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,193
‐ The Nadesico’s priority

369
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,609
is the orderly evacuation
of the Colony’s personnel.

370
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,148
Besides, it appears they
don’t want our help.

371
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,194
‐ [Harry] I see.

372
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,606
‐ Got that right!

373
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,196
The Unified Forces is now an
invincible military power,

374
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,410
equipped to defeat any enemy
on land, sea, air or space!

375
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,452
Your Fleet is but
an obsolete relic!

376
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,907
So sit back and
enjoy the show, kids!

377
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,286
(laughing)

378
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,246
‐ What’s he so excited about?

379
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:19,336
‐ Now’s our chance.

380
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,589
Hack into the Amaterasu
one more time.

381
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,210
‐ Huh, we’re going
back in there?

382
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,297
‐ Yes.

383
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,264
The keyword is Akito.

384
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:28,265
‐ [Harry] Huh?

385
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,144
Akito?

386
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,102
What does that mean?

387
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,139
Captain, answer me.

388
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,394
Captain?

389
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,273
‐ Raise IFS feedback
to level 10.

390
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,810
All stations, stand by at
alert status, pattern A.

391
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:39,808
Systems control.

392
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,154
Akito...

393
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,317
‐ Stop saying Akito,
Akito all the time!

394
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,157
(engines roaring)

395
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,911
‐ Get your asses out of my way!

396
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,255
He’s mine!

397
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,289
‐ [Male Technician] The
enemy has moved back

398
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:57,624
to the second Line.

399
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,208
High altitude mobile
units are in pursuit.

400
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,673
(laughing)

401
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,464
‐ How do you like
that, Shinjyuu?

402
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,416
There’s the might of
the Unified Forces!

403
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,416
Bear witness to the new force!

404
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,678
‐ Yeah.
‐ Puke hole Space Fleet scum.

405
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,552
They may have pushed people
around during the war,

406
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,177
but not this time!

407
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,136
This is for the United Earth
unified peacekeeping forces.

408
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,137
This is for the Hisago Plan!

409
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,017
‐ [Male Technician] Increased
reading of Bose particles!

410
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,016
‐ Huh?

411
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,857
(energy blasting)

412
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,069
‐ [Male Technician] Gravity
blast shot from the flank,

413
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,033
heavy losses reported!

414
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,034
‐ [Male Technician]
Estimated total mass.

415
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,116
It’s a battleship!

416
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,699
(dramatic music)

417
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,616
‐ So now a battleship
that can boson jump.

418
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,333
‐ Do you think it’s Nergal?

419
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,503
‐ Don’t know.

420
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:39,671
So what’d they say?

421
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,500
‐ To be there in five minutes.

422
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,666
‐ Whoo, this is gonna be close.

423
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,464
Emergency orders,
evacuation in five.

424
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,257
‐ Let me welcome all
evacuees onboard.

425
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:52,092
I’m captain of the
Nadesico, Commander Hoshino.

426
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,468
We are currently moving
away from Amaterasu

427
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,805
out to the second line, where
we are aid with the injured.

428
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,349
‐ [Male Technician]
Nadesico‐B has cleared port

429
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,767
from Amaterasu.

430
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,395
‐ Who cares, as long as
the brat’s out of the way?

431
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,364
Counterattack that battleship!

432
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,402
Bring the Kirutantasu and
the Yoimachizuki about,

433
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,108
and do it now!

434
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,066
‐ [Male Technician] Aye!

435
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,828
(energy blasting)

436
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:17,624
‐ [Mysterious Voice] Lapis.

437
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,253
Lapis.

438
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,122
Lapis.

439
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,124
Lapis!

440
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:28,132
(explosions booming)

441
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,554
(groaning)

442
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:30,882
‐ I got him!

443
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,838
Just get the hell out of my way!

444
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,893
(explosions booming)

445
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:45,062
There you are!

446
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,766
Eat that!

447
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,529
‐ We’ll cover.
‐ Try and keep up!

448
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,400
(engine roaring)

449
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,986
‐ [Ruri] First, a
sudden attack and raid.

450
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,615
A diversion from an ambush
masked as a counterattack.

451
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,405
All the while yet another raid,

452
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,169
now from a different route.

453
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,333
‐ Whoa, that’s something.

454
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,798
‐ Miss Ryoko’s quite
amazing for catching this.

455
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,380
‐ So now what?

456
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,263
‐ Now we wait a little longer.

457
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:12,802
‐ Huh?

458
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,335
‐ Their objective, the
enemy’s actual objective,

459
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,098
well, I’m sure you wanna know.

460
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:22,271
(explosions booming)
(weapons firing)

461
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:23,603
‐ [Pilot] Jettison!

462
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:24,688
‐ [Pilot] Jettisoning!

463
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,230
(growling)

464
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:29,114
(dramatic music)

465
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:36,493
‐ Damn it, I guess you think
you’re Genkigangar, huh?

466
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:37,736
‐ Shoot it down!

467
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,445
Fire, fire, fire!

468
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,445
Send everything you’ve got!

469
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,247
Fire!

470
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,081
(guns firing)

471
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:45,956
That’s it!

472
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,633
(Ryoko screaming)

473
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,927
‐ Ah, crap!
‐ Drop that bastard!

474
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,140
Rip him to shreds!

475
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,431
‐ Dumbasses!

476
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,980
You crazy dipshits are
doing more harm than good!

477
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,979
‐ Listen, pilot, we would
have had that prick by now,

478
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,812
but you keep getting in the way!

479
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,768
‐ It’s you that’s
getting in my way!

480
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,477
(both growling)

481
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,648
‐ Didn’t anyone ever teach you
not to leave the gate open?

482
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,820
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

483
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,122
‐ [Male Technician] Gate
number 13 is opening.

484
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,832
Command from a hacked source.

485
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:26,292
‐ Gate 13 can’t be
opening, it doesn’t exist.

486
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,794
‐ Sorry Admiral,
wrong on both counts.

487
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,586
‐ [Admiral] What‐what
are you saying?

488
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,170
‐ I am saying the
charade’s over.

489
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,012
You’re no longer needed.

490
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:41,143
(explosions booming)
(engines roaring)

491
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:42,851
(Ryoko yelling)

492
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,232
‐ [Ryoko] Here I come, catch me!

493
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,691
(explosion booming)
Ah, crap!

494
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,980
‐ It’s been quite
some time, Miss Ryoko.

495
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,654
‐ Been almost two years now.

496
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,072
You’re still looking good.

497
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,532
‐ And you still never
cease to amaze me.

498
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:56,823
(Ryoko chuckling)

499
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,164
‐ Hell, knocking
off unmanned drones

500
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,199
don’t really count for nothin’.

501
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,163
‐ [Ruri] It seems
they’re part of a trap

502
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:04,162
designed for any intruder,
regardless of friend or foe.

503
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,665
‐ [Ryoko] Hmm...

504
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,036
‐ [Ruri] The traps end up ahead.

505
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,503
I’ll guide you from here.

506
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,132
‐ Thank you much.

507
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,709
Wait, you’ve been hacking
into the Unified System,

508
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,055
haven’t you?

509
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,760
‐ And the enemy’s been
doing the same thing.

510
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,341
Oh, and the one actually
doing all the hacking

511
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:19,586
is Harry here.
‐ Huh?

512
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,549
Why are you doing this to me?

513
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,597
(Ryoko laughing)

514
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,984
(mysterious whirring)

515
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,765
‐ [Male Technician]
The enemy has reached

516
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,476
the fifth isolation partition.

517
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,115
‐ Initiate plan beta.

518
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,733
Dispatch to all branches.
‐ Let me go!

519
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:36,608
I’m not going anywhere!
‐ Calmly.

520
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,856
‐ Look Admiral, please be quiet.

521
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,856
‐ Lieutenant Colonel
Shinjyuu, what are you doing?

522
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,871
Who the hell do
you think you are?

523
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,081
‐ Enemy of the Earth,
enemy of Jupiter,

524
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,083
and enemy to all other
forms of corruption.

525
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,246
‐ Oh?

526
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,165
‐ Yes, Admiral, I’m
a Martian Successor!

527
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:02,053
(electronic beeping)

528
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,928
‐ All right, hold
it right there.

529
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,938
That’s a communications tether.

530
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,784
There’s someone who wants
to have a word with you.

531
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:18,992
‐ Hello there.

532
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,951
I am Lieutenant
Commander Ruri Hoshino

533
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,950
of the UE Space Fleet.

534
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,913
I’m terribly sorry
for the entrance,

535
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,082
but since you’ve locked out

536
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,040
all window communications links,

537
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,120
I’ve asked Miss Ryoko
to act as a relay.

538
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,497
So I’m wondering,

539
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,048
I, uh, who are you?

540
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,510
What is your mission?

541
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,472
‐ Lapis, analyze pass key.

542
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,941
‐ Please enter password, please!

543
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,229
(electronic beeping)

544
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:58,655
‐ There’s no time.

545
00:21:58,776 --> 00:21:59,936
You can watch if you want.

546
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,027
(dramatic music)

547
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:09,622
‐ What?

548
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,424
Ruri, are you getting this?

549
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,669
‐ Miss Ryoko.

550
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:15,882
‐ I don’t believe it!

551
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,711
‐ Miss Ryoko, please stay calm.

552
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:18,957
‐ What’s going on here?

553
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,336
‐ Miss Ryoko.

554
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,224
‐ Ah, what the hell?
‐ Miss Ryoko.

555
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:30,061
Its shape may have changed,
but it is the ruin.

556
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,392
The very same Martian ruin
that both Earth and Jupiter

557
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:35,188
spent countless lives
fighting each other for.

558
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,311
The black box of boson jumping.

559
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,694
And now it appears to be at
the heart of the Hisago Plan.

560
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:42,529
‐ That’s right.

561
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,702
‐ Ruri.

562
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,282
‐ Huh?

563
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,865
‐ They must be turning in
their graves right now.

564
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,081
‐ [Ruri] Miss Ryoko...

565
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:54,253
‐ [Ryoko] What the hell
is this doing here?

566
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,421
‐ It is here for the sake
of the future of mankind!

567
00:22:58,544 --> 00:22:59,134
(gasping)

568
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,501
‐ Admiral Kusakabe?

569
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:02,882
‐ Ryoko‐chan, make a hard right!

570
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:05,717
(Ryoko yelling)

571
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,524
‐ The Hisago Plan now belongs
to the Martian Successors.

572
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,060
(men cheering)

573
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,106
‐ Ladies and gentlemen,
our first course of action

574
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,362
might make some of you
a little uncomfortable,

575
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:25,533
as we are planning to destroy
and abandon the Amaterasu.

576
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:28,073
‐ Well, they sure are
a considerate sort.

577
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,777
‐ Did you find what we needed?

578
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:30,779
‐ Oh, sure did.

579
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,293
‐ I’m back, how are you doing?

580
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,665
‐ Uh, well, I guess
things have looked better.

581
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,211
‐ Can you move?

582
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:41,424
‐ [Ryoko] Not much‐‐

583
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,763
(explosions booming)
Goddamn it!

584
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:46,721
(weapons firing)

585
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,559
‐ [Akito] This has
nothing to do with you.

586
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:54,351
Now go.

587
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,353
‐ [Ryoko] Yeah, right, whatever!

588
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,104
(explosions booming)
What the?

589
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:10,284
(electricity crackling)

590
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,544
‐ [Hokushin] Twixt a
single dusk and dawn,

591
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,829
the starry spiral
stretching like a snake,

592
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,956
reached the heavens above.

593
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,081
Amatsukuni beckons.

594
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,838
Wishing to die in front
of your woman, are you?

595
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,173
‐ "Your woman?"

596
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,547
(Akito shuddering)
Huh?

597
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:29,302
(dramatic music)

598
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:35,814
(gasping)

599
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,821
(explosion booming)

600
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,322
Akito, it’s you!

601
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:51,244
That’s why you
called me Ryoko‐chan!

602
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,743
‐ [Hokushin] Vanish.

603
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,125
(explosion booming)

604
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,452
‐ Sorry it took
me so long, guys.

605
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,883
‐ Go back, Suba, you don’t
know what you’re doing!

606
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,304
It’s Yurika and Akito, they’re‐‐

607
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,300
‐ Sorry, but the captain’s
orders were very specific.

608
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,183
‐ Ruri, can you hear me?

609
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,510
Come in, damn it!

610
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,764
You saw it, you saw what
I saw, they’re alive!

611
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,597
They’re alive, Ruri, we
can’t leave them again!

612
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,483
Ruri, Ruri, please!

613
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,390
Goddamn it!

614
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:24,018
‐ All hands, please stand down.

615
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:27,146
We will leave this sector upon
retrieval of the Aestivalis.

616
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,444
‐ [Crew Member] Aye aye.

617
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,454
‐ [Jun] Haruki Kusakabe.

618
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,445
Former Jovian Vice Admiral.

619
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,327
The Federation’s de facto
number one during the war.

620
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,755
As the anti‐Kusakabe faction
of the young officers

621
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:44,536
unleashed their coup d’état,

622
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,628
was forefront of the fight.

623
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,052
Eventually, he went
MIA during combat.

624
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,921
‐ [Yoshida] Somehow,
he stayed alive.

625
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,260
‐ Hmm.

626
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,344
As a former member of
the Jovian Federation,

627
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:55,888
I am much ashamed.

628
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:56,971
‐ Please.

629
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,556
‐ According to Commander
Hoshino’s data,

630
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,852
there are many supporters
of Kusakabe’s cause.

631
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,694
Military officers, politicians,
and numerous others,

632
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,811
all of whom are closely
tied to the Hisago Plan

633
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,228
are believed to be in his camp.

634
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,317
‐ Are you telling me
that the United Earth

635
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,571
ended up preparing
the Hisago Plan

636
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,663
simply for Kusakabe to
do with as he please?

637
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,030
‐ [Ruri] Yes.

638
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,406
At the core is
the Crimson Group,

639
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,914
who initiated the Hisago‐‐

640
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,906
‐ Commander, you need not
stand in order to respond.

641
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:22,747
‐ Yes, sir.

642
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,876
It seems the confederacy
of anti‐Nergal industries

643
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,880
and Kusakabe were already
in contact during the war.

644
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,263
They’re seeking to gain total
control of boson jumping,

645
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,681
and thus of the economy
and government as well.

646
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,600
‐ Admiral Kusakabe
was always one

647
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,510
to constantly stress
both the importance

648
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,017
and dangers of boson jumping.

649
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,680
‐ I’m sure he feels
it’s a just cause,

650
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,848
but I doubt those
subjugated will agree.

651
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,017
‐ No doubt.

652
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,945
‐ [Kouichiro] Akiyama.

653
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:48,985
‐ Sir?

654
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,568
‐ What sort of man is Kusakabe?

655
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:52,491
What is your impression of him?

656
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,861
After all, you served as a
direct subordinate to him

657
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:55,857
for quite some time.

658
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:59,278
‐ Hmm, hot‐blooded and
bent on righteousness.

659
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,999
A man who would die
to realize his ideals.

660
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,541
But what makes him so
dangerous is that he believes

661
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,043
that righteousness in his eyes

662
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:09,295
should be righteousness in
the eyes of everyone else.

663
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,301
‐ [Saburota] Nadesico‐C?

664
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,803
‐ Yes, third
generation of Nadesico.

665
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,675
C, as in A, B, C.

666
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,974
It’s currently going through
final checking procedures

667
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,636
in the Nergal dock on the moon.

668
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,854
‐ We would like to assign
you the top secret,

669
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,347
and shall we say, independent
mission of retaking the ruin.

670
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,189
‐ If so, then we should
not recruit the services

671
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,315
of any regular enlisted crew.

672
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,901
‐ Exactly.
‐ What are we supposed to do?

673
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,697
(Prospector laughing)

674
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,622
‐ [Prospector] Just leave
that business to me!

675
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:39,319
‐ [All] Huh?

676
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:42,409
‐ Hello, from the deep blue sea!

677
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,999
And what that means is that
we will be cooperating fully

678
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,005
with your efforts.

679
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,044
‐ Uh, Prospector?

680
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,300
Is that your real name?

681
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,169
‐ Just a pseudonym.

682
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,296
Right, I suppose
we should split up

683
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,763
to go recruit our crew.

684
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,718
I guess this will be quite a
reunion of sorts, won’t it?

685
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:03,888
‐ Yes.

686
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,926
‐ [Prospector] I say,
it has been a long time,

687
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,438
hasn’t it, Miss Ruri?

688
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,599
‐ [Ruri] Yes, it has.

689
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,404
‐ Look, we still
have the three of us.

690
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,066
With all of our crew
working together,

691
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:17,486
we can beat anything!

692
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:20,491
‐ [Ruri] Hello?

693
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,027
(gasping)

694
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,490
‐ It’s been so
long, my Ruriruri!

695
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:25,998
‐ Whoa!
‐ Wow!

696
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,079
‐ Wow!
‐ Whoa!

697
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,537
‐ [Hikaru] What, the Nadesico‐C?

698
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,255
‐ [Ruri] Yeah, and since the
operation is very secretive,

699
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,087
we’re avoiding
enlisted soldiers,

700
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,213
which is why we’ve come to‐‐

701
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,720
‐ [Hikaru] Hmm.

702
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,719
Sure, okay.

703
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,050
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

704
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,635
Now that didn’t take long.

705
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,100
‐ But don’t you have your
serial here to manage?

706
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:47,023
(Hikaru chuckling)

707
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,393
‐ Oh thank God you’re here!

708
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,439
I’m way behind my
deadlines tonight

709
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,233
and my assistants are
gone with flus and coughs

710
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:54,897
and engagement parties!

711
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,445
‐ Oh, I see.

712
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,068
(phone ringing)
(upbeat music)

713
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:00,696
‐ Great, no visual yet.

714
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:01,911
Uh, how are you
doing, Miss Amano?

715
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,830
‐ Uh, who is this?

716
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:04,579
I’m Harry.
‐ Huh?

717
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,581
Look here, I need Miss Amano.

718
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,002
It’s her editor, kid.

719
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,500
‐ There’s something wrong
with your telephone.

720
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,421
‐ No, no, don’t hang up!

721
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,130
No, no, wait!

722
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,882
‐ (sighing) They’ll call back.

723
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,592
‐ Oh, thanks so much,
you guys are pros!

724
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,264
Now use tone 61 and
double layer your shadows.

725
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:21,762
‐ Yeah.

726
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,005
‐ [Hikaru] And Sabu, put
passion into that pointillism.

727
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,645
‐ Will do.

728
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,933
‐ [Hikaru] And Harry, make
that curry extra, extra spicy!

729
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:28,427
‐ Yeah...

730
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,767
‐ What’s impossible with
one can be done as a team!

731
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:34,904
All right, just 12 more
pages left, let’s do it!

732
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,277

734
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,330
‐ [Woman] Sweetie,
are you happy with me?

735
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,870
‐ [Man] You know you
make me happy, baby.

736
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:51,413

‐ Ruri Hoshino,
systems operator.

752
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,169
I am 11 years old.

753
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:43,049
‐ Hello.

754
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,217
‐ Hello!

755
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:46,554
‐ [All] Hello!

756
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,308
‐ Ruri, hello!

757
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,849
‐ You’re so cute, we’re going
to be the best of friends!

758
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,644
‐ [Man] The Nadesico
will go to Mars.

759
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:57,365
‐ [Ruri] Akito!

760
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,359
Akito!

761
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,570
Oh Akito, listen to me!

762
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,526
‐ Remember that boson jumping

763
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,284
is reverse engineered technology

764
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:10,826
based purely on what
we’ve discovered on
Mars to this point.

765
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,621
So basically whoever
makes the right

766
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,374
Martian excavation first will
gain more of an advantage

767
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:16,878
than any technological
innovation.

768
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,170
‐ Is what really
all there is to it?

769
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,592
‐ (chuckles) Suppose so.

770
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,552
But imagine if they
discover something

771
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:26,131
of far greater significance,
impacting space itself.

772
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:38,102
(explosion booming)

773
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,020
(plaster cracking)

774
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,396
(screaming)

775
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,780
(gasping)

776
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:51,576
‐ [Ruri] Oh...

777
00:31:57,249 --> 00:32:00,079
(car horns honking)

778
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,631
‐ Ooh baby!
(men catcalling)

779
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,304
Where’s the fire?

780
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,263
Slow down, mama!

781
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:06,593
‐ Yeah, right.

782
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,264
I’m so sorry!

783
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:11,137
I’m home!

784
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,603
I did it, Miss Minato!

785
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:15,021
I’ve been voted a junior member!

786
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,350
Huh?

787
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:19,195
‐ Oh, please forgive me,
but something big’s come up.

788
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,191
Ciao!

789
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,652
Oh, please forgive me,

790
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,783
but something big’s come up.
‐ She blew a kiss?

791
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,819
‐ Ciao!
‐ That seems odd.

792
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,034
Well, don’t you think so?

793
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:30,033
(wind chime ringing)

794
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:33,125
‐ [Yoshida] I must say, both
the United Earth and the UEAF

795
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:35,583
seem to be scrambling
after this development.

796
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,462
‐ [Genpachiro] Ah, it
doesn’t surprise me.

797
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:38,789
‐ [Kouichiro] What
is the latest report?

798
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:39,504
‐ Aye.

799
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,134
The so‐called Martian Successors

800
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,419
have now managed to
occupy the polar ruin.

801
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:47,013
Kusakabe sympathizers are
gathering there as we speak,

802
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,222
and it has been
estimated that around 30%

803
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:52,141
of the United Forces are
now supporting his side.

804
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,645
‐ It appears the marginalized
nations of the UE

805
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:58,104
are unofficially endorsing this.

806
00:32:58,185 --> 00:32:59,735
‐ And with the Space
Fleet depleted,

807
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,151
it can only add to
that confidence.

808
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,440
‐ We’ve been fortunate.

809
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,073
‐ What?

810
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,190
We are not fortunate, they’re
a bunch of dirty traitors!

811
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,699
How can you be so
nonchalant about this?

812
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,531
‐ Easy, terrorist movements
create a public allure

813
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,367
of glamorized
courage and nobility.

814
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:15,703
‐ Oh, please!

815
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,287
‐ Outside call
for Commander Aoi.

816
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,620
‐ Oh?
‐ Hey!

817
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:19,865
How are you doing Jun?

818
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,118
It’s me!

819
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,458
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

820
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,132
‐ What, why’d you
patch her through?

821
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:26,381
‐ She claimed to be a very
close acquaintance of yours.

822
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:27,765
And well, who would claim that?

823
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,009
(Jun grumbling)

824
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,592
‐ Miss Minato is heading
your way, isn’t she?

825
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,505
‐ Huh?

826
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:32,393
(Jun stammering)

827
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,051
‐ Don’t you play stupid with me!

828
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,509
I don’t know if it’s Nergal
or Space Fleet or whatever,

829
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:37,468
but you’re up to something.

830
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,057
So just tell me.

831
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,774
I know you’re being sneaky
and you know I’m right!

832
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,022
‐ Please, this is
classified information!

833
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,726
‐ Ha, I knew you were
hiding something!

834
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,187
‐ Hmph!
‐ Oh, please tell me!

835
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,026
Pretty please?
‐ Huh?

836
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,363
‐ Mr. Aoi, you’re the only
person I can count on.

837
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,697
If you tell me, I’ll go out
with you and be your girlfriend

838
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,783
and even be seen
in public with you.

839
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,287
I won’t be fussy or high
maintenance, I promise!

840
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:01,120
‐ Oh, for Christ’s sake,
will you listen to yourself?

841
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,866
Hey, this is serious!

842
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,039
‐ He’s very capable for
sure, but he can be,

843
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,668
how should I say, a
little too nice sometimes?

844
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,014
‐ Too true.

845
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,629
‐ Just look how this
high school girl

846
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,045
has a hold of him
by the short hairs.

847
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,545
‐ Hey, why don’t
you deal with her?

848
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,756
‐ [Genpachiro] Ah,
summer skies above.

849
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,808
Winds of love, the
gust engulfs in Jun.

850
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,812
(insects trilling)

851
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,400
‐ [Ruri] So he’s out right now?

852
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:31,817
‐ Yes.

853
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:35,533
He’s gone, to a sort of
neighborhood meeting.

854
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:38,075
Do you have some
business with him or‐‐

855
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,581
‐ Well, to tell
you the truth, we‐‐

856
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:40,951
‐ No, ma’am, it’s nothing.

857
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,579
We were simply passing
through the area.

858
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:44,545
Thank you.

859
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:45,794
You have a beautiful family.

860
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,835
‐ That’s the 20th one.

861
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,762
Another former brave
warrior bowing out.

862
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,763
Great.
‐ Who ordered the Mars bowl?

863
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,554
‐ Oh, that one’s me.

864
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,307
‐ [Saburota] Knock
if off, Harry.

865
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:00,471
‐ [Harry] But I only‐‐

866
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,889
‐ [Saburota] But what, Harry?

867
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:04,645
‐ Is it really that important
to reassemble the old crew?

868
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:05,649
‐ Yes.

869
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,520
(loud slurping)

870
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:10,856
‐ I don’t see what’s wrong
with us doing this on our own.

871
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,902
Sure, I can see how we could
use more Aestivalis pilots,

872
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:15,817
but I have the
experience it takes

873
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,567
to manage the ship’s
navigation system by myself,

874
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:22,448
and Mr. Saburota can more
than take of combat C and C.

875
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,367
We’re the best team ever
assembled on the UE Space Fleet,

876
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,787
and these people have all
retired to civilian jobs

877
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,457
and have lives of their own!

878
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:30,956
‐ Harry, shut up, will ya?

879
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,796
‐ Why are they so crucial?

880
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,921
Why do we have to do this?

881
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,428
‐ [Saburota] Harry!

882
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,219
‐ [Harry] Don’t you have
any faith in my abilities?

883
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,183
Captain!

884
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,224
‐ Oh, that’s good.

885
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,315
One more, please.

886
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,979
‐ [Harry] Oh, you
people are impossible!

887
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,191
‐ Harry!

888
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,401
How about paying your
part of the bill, huh?

889
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,520
Crazy little freak boy.

890
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,479
‐ Do you need to go after him?

891
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:53,479
‐ He’s fine.

892
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,030
‐ Are you sure?

893
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,823
‐ We cannot defeat the
enemy all by ourselves.

894
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,446
Harry is young, but he is
well aware of that fact.

895
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,413
‐ He may be aware of it,

896
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:04,453
but that doesn’t mean
he has to accept it.

897
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,657
We’re only humans.

898
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,000
He’s probably jealous, you know?

899
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,884
Jealous of your
old crew and, well,

900
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,342
jealous of the galactically
famous Nadesico.

901
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:15,631
‐ Think so, huh?

902
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,175
(chuckles)

903
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,800
Now where the hell’d that
little buy run off to?

904
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,555
(sniffling)

905
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:26,482
‐ It’s just so stupid, captain.

906
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,729
Whatever she’s thinking, I’m,

907
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,442
I’m sure this doesn’t
show her my maturity.

908
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,862
That’s just great.

909
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,360
I’m just a‐a big boob.
‐ Okay, where is it?

910
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:36,655
‐ Oh!

911
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,986
‐ [Minato] Well,
you’re a bold one.

912
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:40,872
(Harry stammering)
Uh‐‐

913
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,450
‐ Oh, I‐I, uh, didn’t mean to!

914
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:44,866
I’m so sorry!

915
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,754
‐ Hmm?
‐ Forgive me!

916
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,884
‐ Poor thing,
you’ve been crying.

917
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,132
I guess you’re too shook up

918
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,092
to give me directions, huh?

919
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,554
‐ My lady, you’ve
come to the right man!

920
00:36:58,675 --> 00:36:59,805
Now let’s get moving.

921
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,514
I’m a navigator in
the Space Fleet.

922
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,514
I know this neighborhood
like the back of my hand.

923
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,887
(Harry grunting)
‐ Great.

924
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,765
I’m looking for the restaurant
Everyday Tranquility.

925
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,522
‐ Huh?
‐ Yep.

926
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,562
‐ Howmei’s diner?

927
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:12,438
‐ Hey, what’s wrong?

928
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,574
‐ Yeah, I know the place.

929
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,479
But I can’t go there right now.

930
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:16,858
It would be bad.

931
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,197
(loud wailing)

932
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,537
‐ [Minato] Do you
feel better now?

933
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,580
‐ [Harry] Yes, I’m all right.

934
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:33,044
Thanks for being so nice to
someone you just bumped into.

935
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,747
‐ Harry, right?

936
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,838
‐ Hmm?
‐ Yep, I knew it.

937
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,804
‐ In the letters
Ruriruri wrote me,

938
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,926
she spoke a lot of
her new crew members.

939
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,642
She says you’re great.

940
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,014
‐ Me?
‐ Yep.

941
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,559
"He’s like a younger
brother to me.

942
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:52,142
"Our backgrounds are very
similar, but unlike me,

943
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,940
"he’s extremely bright
and well‐behaved."

944
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:58,569
‐ So you were on the Nadesico?

945
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:01,151
‐ Let her take care of
you, Mr. Younger Brother.

946
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,316
(chuckling)

947
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,583
‐ [Ruri] Let’s go back, Harry.

948
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,160
‐ [Saburota] You owe me
five dollars, wise guy.

949
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,171
‐ So what we toasting to?

950
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,672
‐ To an overdue reunion,
and Harry, I guess.

951
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,965
(both laughing)

952
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:22,167
‐ So are you going again,
onboard the Nadesico‐C?

953
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,590
‐ When I first heard
from Mr. Prospector,

954
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,797
I was planning on just
catching up with Ruriruri

955
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,640
and then heading back home.

956
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,393
But now that I’ve seen her, I
don’t know if I can do that.

957
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:32,636
‐ Yeah, I know.

958
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:33,727
She’s pushing it.

959
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:34,982
I know she doesn’t show it much,

960
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:37,323
but the responsibilities
of a captain,

961
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,068
accomplishing a
mission like this,

962
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,150
and the enemy’s no pushover.

963
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,696
‐ It’s too bad she
can’t cut loose

964
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:44,661
and relax at times like this.

965
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,825
Captain.
(ice clinking)

966
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:51,999
(train rumbling)
(whistle blowing)

967
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:02,013
‐ [Harry] Captain...

968
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,677
(train whistle blowing)

969
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:19,977
(men shouting)

970
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,316
‐ What’s going on?
‐ Everything!

971
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,781
Communication effectiveness
is decreasing!

972
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:27,701
(men shouting)
(electronic beeping)

973
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,540
‐ Well, it looks like she still
isn’t in the best of moods.

974
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:33,831
‐ Pleasing a princess
isn’t easy, you know?

975
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:34,753
‐ Hmm.
‐ Huh?

976
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,083
‐ Oh, oh yes, right, the dress.

977
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,248
Miki and the others
wanted her clothes on.

978
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,537
‐ Oh.

979
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,880
‐ [Scientist] She and the
others kept threatening

980
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,925
sexual harassment charges.

981
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,588
‐ Hmm, well, I’m
glad they spoke up.

982
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:47,718
(explosion booming)

983
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,722
(lasers blasting)

984
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,609
‐ Pull them back, no
matter what you do!

985
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:05,776
We need more time!

986
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:07,146
Help’s on the way!

987
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,661
‐ The enemy’s strength
is now below 50%.

988
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,044
We’ve suffered only 3% losses.

989
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,291
‐ We’re doing well.

990
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,874
‐ I’ve been informed
the Fifth Fleet

991
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,537
has knocked out the Kushinada.

992
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:22,166
‐ Right, it’s time to
negotiate their surrender.

993
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,753
(explosion booming)
‐ Huh, what’s that?

994
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,710
‐ [Male Technician]
Engineering’s hit,
we’re under attack!

995
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:26,588
‐ What?

996
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:30,054
(electronic warbling)

997
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,346
(explosions booming)

998
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:36,101
(men ahhing)

999
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,765
‐ V!
‐ Congratulations, Professor.

1000
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:40,275
‐ Hmm.

1001
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:43,146
‐ May we call this a dramatic
success, Mr. Yamasaki?

1002
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,994
‐ Yes, imaging
communications is 98%.

1003
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,740
At this rate, the
navigator’s accuracy

1004
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,610
will be high enough to jump
to an almost exact location.

1005
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,070
‐ Yes, I see.

1006
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,738
‐ And we have this to
thank for our success, sir.

1007
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,910
‐ What the?
‐ Huh?

1008
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,617
‐ Teenage girl comic
books and boson jumping?

1009
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,208
See what you can do to
explain this shit to me.

1010
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:18,809
‐ The stars glimmer as
the hearts of people.

1011
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,404
(water splashing)

1012
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,230
Tenkawa...

1013
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:28,237
He’s here on Earth.

1014
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:34,955
Kept you long?

1015
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,124
‐ Uh, no.

1016
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:43,834
♪ Destined to be a star
in space tomorrow ♪

1017
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,166
(both gulping)

1018
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:52,837
‐ Ensign Harry Makibi.

1019
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,007
‐ Aye!

1020
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:55,637
‐ I have a special
mission for you.

1021
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:58,852
At 0800, you’re to conduct
a long‐distance boson jump

1022
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,273
to Nergal’s lunar factory,

1023
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,731
commencing with
final check procedure

1024
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,603
at the Nadesico‐C.

1025
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:04,938
‐ A lunar jump?

1026
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,523
But we can’t use Chulips.

1027
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:07,859
‐ [Ruri] This will
be a singular jump,

1028
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:09,944
piloted by a Class A jumper.

1029
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,528
‐ Huh?

1030
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,244
‐ Movement by shuttle will
leave you vulnerable to attack,

1031
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,784
making this your
safest means of travel.

1032
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,907
I’ll leave the Omoikane to you.

1033
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:20,656
(electronic warbling)

1034
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:21,907
‐ Fruit basket!

1035
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,536
‐ Oh yeah, I win!

1036
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:25,785
(Ryoko growling)

1037
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:26,787
‐ One more time!

1038
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:28,208
That was the last time you win!

1039
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:30,166
‐ Hey, sure as much as you want,

1040
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,376
since you only know how
do do that one move.

1041
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,217
I might start closing my eyes.

1042
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:35,012
(Ryoko growling)

1043
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,054
‐ Shut up!

1044
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:38,889
And get ready to eat it!
‐ Okay.

1045
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,643
‐ This can’t be a good idea.

1046
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:41,985
‐ Sure.

1047
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,730
No matter how talented a pilot
Miss Hikaru may have been,

1048
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:47,444
two years is a long time
away from the cockpit.

1049
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,395
And for the purposes of
intensive short‐term,

1050
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:52,145
interactive combat
simulation, it’s perfect.

1051
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,236
‐ Lychee Lychee‐ru
Flashing Bright Attack!

1052
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:55,952
(Gekigangar screaming)

1053
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:57,124
(Hikaru laughing)
‐ Oh!

1054
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,491
‐ You’re cuttin’ it
pretty close there.

1055
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,576
‐ Damn it!

1056
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,582
‐ There you go,
forcing it again.

1057
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,292
(Ryoko growling)

1058
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,210
Oopsies!

1059
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:09,246
Yay!
‐ No!

1060
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,091
‐ Wow, Miss Hikaru still
has amazing skills.

1061
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:14,304
‐ This is nothing.

1062
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,045
She’s only at about
60% right now.

1063
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,506
She’ll need more
practice if she wants

1064
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,216
to fight those monsters
on equal footing.

1065
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,057
Have you heard anything
about the latest plans?

1066
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:26,812
‐ No, but we do know that
they are currently in Japan.

1067
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,938
And of course, we also
know what their goal is.

1068
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:30,766
‐ Hmm.
(ukulele ringing)

1069
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,188
‐ Huh?
‐ Hmm?

1070
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,696
Well, it looks like the
trio’s back together.

1071
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:35,949
‐ Got ketchup?

1072
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:37,032
Gotta ketchup.

1073
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,375
(ukulele ringing)
‐ Oopsies!

1074
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,870
‐ Is he the prince in black?

1075
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:43,794
Could it be?

1076
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:47,956
‐ "Are you changing into
someone you don’t know?

1077
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:50,634
‐ "I am changing myself.

1078
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,013
‐ [All] "And I don’t like
the way I’m changing.

1079
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:56,551
‐ "It’s a festival day."
‐ Oh, that’s the next issue.

1080
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,644
‐ Oh.

1081
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,508
‐ But they’ve started
to drift apart.

1082
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,847
What do you think happens
in the next installments?

1083
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:02,643
‐ [Men] Hmm.

1084
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,643
‐ I think that will be enough.

1085
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:05,765
‐ [Men] Aww.

1086
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:07,982
‐ The source of the
system’s energy outburst

1087
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,234
stems directly from dreams.

1088
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,483
The human translator
Yurika Misumaru

1089
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,318
relays the visualizations
to the jump system.

1090
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,784
And her current dreams are
acting as a form of noise,

1091
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:20,454
creating the recent power
surges within the system.

1092
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:23,584
Okay, turn it up.

1093
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:27,251
We are now amplifying
the intensity of the
destination image

1094
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,501
in order to override
Captain Misumaru’s dreams,

1095
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:32,045
only this time,
we’ve incorporated

1096
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,380
some rather romantic subtext.

1097
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:36,876
‐ That’s the reason for Ururun?

1098
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,428
‐ Yes.

1099
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,049
We’ve used her adolescent
dreams to our advantage.

1100
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,468
Right now she’s only a lovely
date with her boyfriend,

1101
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:45,685
and at the same time, increasing
our imaging effectiveness.

1102
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:48,888
This is truly a
technological victory.

1103
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,020
(light gentle music)

1104
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,328
‐ Where do you
want to go, Akito?

1105
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:15,092
‐ Chichibu Mountains.
(glass shattering)

1106
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:17,463
(mechanical whirring)

1107
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,641
‐ Tomorrow is the day.

1108
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,018
(growling)

1109
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,064
‐ [Cloaked Man] The accuracy
of this jump acts as proof,

1110
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,230
does it not?

1111
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,476
‐ Hmm, the information
we gathered

1112
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,108
of the specific locations
will greatly help us.

1113
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:42,238
‐ So what is our
mission for now?

1114
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:44,455
‐ Are we to just watch?

1115
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,735
‐ [Hokushin] No.

1116
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,908
We merely return to
the original mission.

1117
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,245
‐ [Cloaked Man] Then?

1118
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,500
‐ The little doll
and the test subject.

1119
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:53,924
Lapis.

1120
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,125
(elevator dinging)

1121
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:01,837
‐ [Saburota] Did you sleep
well last night, Ensign Makibi?

1122
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:02,586
‐ [Harry] I suppose.

1123
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,138
‐ So tell me, how’d it go?

1124
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:05,222
‐ Huh, how’d what go?

1125
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,104
‐ Come on, I already know.

1126
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,391
You slept in the captain’s
quarters last night.

1127
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:10,885
‐ Wha, how’d you know?

1128
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:13,727
(chuckling)

1129
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:16,363
‐ So, was she all like
nice to you and stuff?

1130
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,070
‐ Well, yeah.

1131
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,070
‐ Ooh, I’ll bet so.

1132
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,362
And?

1133
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,105
‐ We both enjoyed a
strawberry milk drink.

1134
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,820
‐ Yeah, yeah, then what?

1135
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:29,331
‐ Then we held
hands, then slept.

1136
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,413
‐ Huh?

1137
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:33,536
(elevator dinging)

1138
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,803
‐ Let’s go, time is short.

1139
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:43,432
(electronic warbling)

1140
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:44,969
‐ [Male Technician]
All systems normal.

1141
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,052
‐ [Female Technician]
Jumper’s heart rate

1142
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,967
and body temperature, normal.

1143
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:51,015
‐ How are you feeling,
Ensign Makibi?

1144
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:51,812
(Harry chuckling)

1145
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:52,772
‐ [Harry] To tell you the truth,

1146
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:54,392
I feel a bit like a marionette.

1147
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,058
(laughing)

1148
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:57,977
‐ Well, that’s all
there so we can measure

1149
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:00,145
your physical and
psychological condition

1150
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,574
right up to the point you jump.

1151
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,072
Please bear with it.

1152
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:04,204
‐ [Harry] Aye!

1153
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,532
‐ Harry, see you on the moon.

1154
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,117
‐ [Harry] Okay.

1155
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,370
‐ [Male Technician] The
navigator is positioned

1156
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:10,993
at the center of the circle.

1157
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,040
‐ [Female Technician] Beginning
activation of the crystals.

1158
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:14,084
‐ My name is Harry.

1159
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:15,375
Nice to meet you.

1160
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,419
‐ [Jumper] It’s
nice to meet you.

1161
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,340
‐ This, uh, is the first time

1162
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:20,339
I’ve ever met a Class
A jumper before.

1163
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:22,173
‐ I see.

1164
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:23,508
I will be conducting
the visualization
of your destination

1165
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:27,092
so you just close your
eyes and breathe easy.

1166
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:29,347
Think of something
fun and happy,

1167
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:30,850
anything to help you relax.

1168
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:33,934
‐ Just relax, just relax...

1169
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,106
‐ Activation of the Chulip
crystals running normal.

1170
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:41,019
‐ Increasing mass levels
of photons and gravitons.

1171
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,650
‐ [Male Technician]
Synchronization to
jumper navigator

1172
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:44,655
progressing smoothly.

1173
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:46,447
‐ [Female Technician] Boson
exchange ratio increasing.

1174
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,120
‐ Jump in, Harry!

1175
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,829
(heroic music)

1176
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,200
‐ [Jumper] Let’s go, Harry.

1177
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:53,538
‐ [Harry] Aye.

1178
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,044
‐ Huh?

1179
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:02,050
‐ What’s up?

1180
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:03,381
‐ The Princess just moved.

1181
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:05,586
‐ Oh, get real.

1182
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,506
‐ [Cleaner] Maybe
there was another jump?

1183
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,263
‐ [Cleaner] Maybe
you’re just an idiot.

1184
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,347
(birds chirping)

1185
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,390
‐ What’s wrong?

1186
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:13,683
‐ It’s Harry’s jump.

1187
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:15,636
It should be
happening about now.

1188
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:19,941
‐ I figured you would have
at least gone to see him off.

1189
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:22,024
‐ I couldn’t handle
a third time.

1190
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:23,358
‐ Hmm?

1191
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,902
‐ [Ruri] I know it
sounds superstitious,

1192
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:27,235
but I don’t want
to jinx anything.

1193
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:28,663
‐ Hmm, you’re just stubborn.

1194
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:34,578
(gong ringing)

1195
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,504
Akito?

1196
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,785
No way.

1197
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,800
‐ Today is the second
year anniversary.

1198
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:56,222
I should have realized sooner.

1199
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,638
‐ Hmm?

1200
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,768
‐ There were many jumpers
other than Mr. Akito,

1201
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:02,765
the Captain and Miss
Inez who either died

1202
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:04,567
or disappeared back then.

1203
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:07,574
Class A boson jumpers,

1204
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:11,113
navigators who can
accurately communicate

1205
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:11,700
to where they wish to jump.

1206
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:16,915
They were all abducted by
the Martian Successors,

1207
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:18,076
weren’t they?

1208
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:20,174
(crows cawing)

1209
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:21,541
‐ [Minato] Abducted?

1210
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,455
‐ [Ruri] Mr. Akito, I
cannot begin to imagine

1211
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:26,344
what you’ve been through
the past two years.

1212
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:28,724
‐ Believe me, you don’t want to.

1213
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,299
‐ You’re right, I don’t
think I really want to know.

1214
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,135
Ever.

1215
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:35,756
But why?

1216
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:38,848
Why couldn’t you tell me
that you were still alive?

1217
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:46,113
‐ [Akito] Because
there was no reason to.

1218
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:49,649
‐ [Ruri] I see.

1219
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:50,487
(Minato gasping)

1220
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:51,571
(loud slapping)

1221
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,945
‐ How dare you say such a thing?

1222
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:55,413
Aren’t you the same
person who said

1223
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:57,333
you wanted to take
Ruri into your home?

1224
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:59,333
Apologize to her, Akito!

1225
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,543
Apologize!

1226
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,334
She has been worried
sick about you

1227
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:03,378
and you do nothing but‐‐

1228
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,461
(gun cocking)

1229
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:06,674
Uh, A‐Akito?

1230
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,683
‐ You are lax, Akito Tenkawa.

1231
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,224
I think you’d better
submit and come with us.

1232
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:18,643
‐ Who on earth is that?

1233
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,774
(gun firing)
Ah!

1234
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,650
‐ [Hokushin] I say
again, come with us now.

1235
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,903
‐ [Minato] Akito?

1236
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,198
‐ We may sever his limbs,
but I want him alive.

1237
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,868
Slice.

1238
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,160
‐ This has nothing
to do with you two,

1239
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:39,293
so you’d best get
someplace safe.

1240
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:42,370
‐ Escape is not an option
at a time like this.

1241
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:43,998
‐ I think you’re right.

1242
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,083
‐ And the woman?

1243
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:45,789
‐ Kill her.

1244
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,286
‐ What about the girl?

1245
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:48,878
‐ I want her to be captured.

1246
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:52,673
She wears a pair of golden
eyes, like that of Lapis,

1247
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:56,338
the white fairy created
by the technology of man.

1248
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,758
It appears the people of Earth

1249
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,388
have become infatuated
with genetic alterations.

1250
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:03,234
She shall become the cornerstone
of the glorious research

1251
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,730
being conducted at our
society’s laboratories.

1252
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,610
‐ You’re the ones, aren’t you?

1253
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,573
You have been
intercepting and abducting

1254
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:13,574
all the Class A jumpers.

1255
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:14,776
‐ [Hokushin] Correct.

1256
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,815
We are the shadows of
the Martian Successors,

1257
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,908
the dregs of men left
to tread the path

1258
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,414
humanity dares not travel.

1259
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,865
‐ [All] All for the glory of
the rise of the new order.

1260
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:27,628
(Genichiro laughing)
‐ Hmm?

1261
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,251
(heroic music)
‐ What?

1262
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:32,256
‐ Talk from you of a new order
is nothing but laughable.

1263
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,669
It is true that new order
follows destruction and chaos.

1264
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,338
It is natural that
rebirth would accompany

1265
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,428
so much death and pain.

1266
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,223
But, not here.

1267
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:42,807
Kusakabe has no virtue.

1268
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,904
‐ It’s been a long time,
Genichiro Tsukiomi.

1269
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:50,649
The traitor who sold Jupiter
sure has a lot to bark about.

1270
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,864
‐ [Genichiro] True, a
traitor to a friend,

1271
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,403
traitor to Jupiter,

1272
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:56,696
and now, a dog of Nergal.

1273
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,450
(guns cocking)

1274
00:51:58,574 --> 00:51:59,374
‐ What now, sir?

1275
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:00,990
‐ Calm yourself.

1276
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,788
‐ It appears your ceaseless
attachment to Tenkawa

1277
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,620
will be your demise.

1278
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,215
‐ Huh, huh?

1279
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,620
Ah!

1280
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,380
‐ Long time no see, Miss Minato.

1281
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,460
‐ I‐I guess so.

1282
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:12,337
(chuckling)

1283
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:13,343
‐ This is a sacred place

1284
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:15,264
reserved for the dead
to rest peacefully.

1285
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:18,221
So please surrender
yourself with grace.

1286
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:19,852
‐ And if we do not?

1287
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,720
‐ You’ll be a resident here.

1288
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,385
‐ We shall see.

1289
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:24,724
Destroy them.

1290
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:25,638
‐ Right!

1291
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:28,936
(cloaked man roaring)

1292
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:32,731
(cloaked man groaning)

1293
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,856
‐ Jovian Federation
swordsmanship

1294
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:35,895
is not the skill of an assassin.

1295
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:38,491
(bones cracking)

1296
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:40,824
(cloaked men yelling)

1297
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:42,278
(cloaked men groaning)

1298
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:43,658
‐ No way!

1299
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:45,866
‐ It’s Jovian‐style Yawara.

1300
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,496
‐ [Minato] Huh?

1301
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:51,291
‐ No sword of corruption
can defeat Yawara skills.

1302
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:52,377
Surrender now!

1303
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:54,133
It’s over, Hokushin!

1304
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:55,553
‐ I think not.

1305
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:57,513
(loud whirring)

1306
00:52:57,633 --> 00:52:58,683
‐ What the?

1307
00:52:58,801 --> 00:52:59,801
How the hell is
he going to jump?

1308
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,465
(laughing)

1309
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:05,024
‐ [Hokushin] We’ll meet
again, Akito Tenkawa!

1310
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:10,056
‐ Independent boson jumping?

1311
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,807
‐ Yurika is now under
their spell, it seems.

1312
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,438
‐ What?

1313
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:17,535
‐ Kusakabe’s offenses will
be coming soon, so I‐‐

1314
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:18,701
‐ Go on.

1315
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,571
‐ There is something
very important

1316
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:21,868
that I would like
to give to you.

1317
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:23,989
(engine roaring)

1318
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:28,583
‐ Hey, it’s so great
to see everyone again.

1319
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,496
‐ [Male Crewman] We’re gonna
cover for Chief Uribatake

1320
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:31,882
in his absence, right?

1321
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
‐ Time to show him what the
maintenance crew can do!

1322
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:34,755
‐ Yeah, we got their backs!

1323
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,378
‐ [Maintenance Crew] Hoo‐ah!

1324
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:40,185
‐ Seems like Akatsuki doesn’t
quite the punch he used to.

1325
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:41,839
‐ And he’s losing his hair.

1326
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,427
It hangs by a hair.

1327
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:45,474
(laughing)

1328
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:47,846
‐ [Pilot] Lunar ETA is
approximately 1400 hours‐‐

1329
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,773
‐ [Minato] Ruriruri?

1330
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:50,733
‐ Yes?

1331
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:51,523
‐ So can you tell me what it was

1332
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:53,863
that Akito gave to you?

1333
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,479
‐ [Ruri] It’s a recipe.

1334
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:56,726
‐ Recipe?

1335
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:59,277
‐ It’s the Tenkawa
Special Ramen recipe.

1336
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:01,573
‐ [Minato] The one he
offered you out of his yatai?

1337
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:02,405
‐ Yeah.

1338
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:07,907
There’s no way I can accept
this from you, Akito.

1339
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:10,415
When this is all over,
you’ve rescued Miss Yurika,

1340
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,959
and everything’s back to normal,
you’re going to need this.

1341
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,963
‐ I have no use for it anymore.

1342
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,455
The Akito Tenkawa that
you once knew is now dead.

1343
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:21,549
I would like you to hold the
proof that he once existed.

1344
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:23,593
‐ You’re being a bit dramatic.

1345
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,097
‐ You don’t understand, Ruri.

1346
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,183
While performing all
their experiments on me,

1347
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,635
they did something to my brain.

1348
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:31,768
And ever since then‐‐

1349
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:32,852
(gasping)

1350
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,766
(dramatic music)

1351
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:36,557
I haven’t been the same.

1352
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:37,898
My sense of taste is gone.

1353
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,153
When I get excited,

1354
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,066
this stuff can really
start shining on me.

1355
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:43,573
I’m sort of like a comic book.

1356
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:47,485
So I won’t be able to make
ramen for you anymore.

1357
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:48,328
I’m sorry.

1358
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:54,118
‐ [Prospector] I’ll see you
all at the victory celebration!

1359
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:59,213
‐ It’s strange, being on
the side, seeing them off.

1360
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:01,634
‐ [Girl] Mr. Prospector!

1361
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:02,465
‐ Huh?
‐ Hmm?

1362
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,799
‐ Hey, Miss Howmei!

1363
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:05,264
‐ [Girls] We made it!

1364
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:08,054
‐ Well, well, but they’ve
already taken off.

1365
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,808
‐ No, they have a different
mission to work on.

1366
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:11,681
‐ Okay?

1367
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:13,519
‐ Okay girls, let’s get to it!

1368
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:14,694
‐ [Girls] Aye!

1369
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,945
(engine roaring)

1370
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,475
(electronic beeping)

1371
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:24,990
‐ [Yukina] So please sit back,
relax, and enjoy the flight.

1372
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:28,073
Would anyone like
some tasty beverages?

1373
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,948
‐ [Passengers] Huh?

1374
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:32,325
‐ We’ll be serving
juices, colas, beers,

1375
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,752
whiskey, sake, and
lots of snacks as well.

1376
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:35,542
Ah!

1377
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:37,576
(passengers oohing)

1378
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:38,998
‐ Hey, hold on a second.

1379
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:41,296
What are you doing here, Yukina?

1380
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,090
My God!

1381
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,842
‐ I’d like some hiyahshiame.

1382
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:45,426
‐ Sure.

1383
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:46,589
‐ Double durian juice.

1384
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,137
‐ You have got more important
business to deal with.

1385
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,350
You should go home right now.

1386
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:51,011
For heaven’s sake,
don’t you have school?

1387
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,599
‐ But it’s summer vacation.

1388
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:53,983
‐ What about track and field?

1389
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,769
You’ve got intermural
races soon!

1390
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,693
‐ That’s the week after next.

1391
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,191
Besides, if the mission fails,

1392
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:00,863
then that’ll be
called off anyway.

1393
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:02,111
‐ (growls) You’re a fool!

1394
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,032
You should be at home!

1395
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,990
(blowing raspberry)

1396
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,820
‐ And Jun, where
are your clothes?

1397
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,155
‐ No way, please stop!
(girls teasing)

1398
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,870
Oh uh, I was just, uh, you know?

1399
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:12,701
‐ I don’t think anyone
can you seriously

1400
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,036
dressed up like that, Jun.

1401
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:15,121
(Jun grumbling)

1402
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,245
(passengers laughing)

1403
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:19,463
‐ Miss Minato, let’s
talk about this later,

1404
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:21,043
perhaps after we’ve
landed on the moon.

1405
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:25,379
‐ Mmhmm, sure, sure,
later sounds super.

1406
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,627
‐ You know, you’re gonna
get burned one day.

1407
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:28,758
‐ Yeah, yeah.

1408
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:32,346
(engine roaring)

1409
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:34,431
‐ Main boosters, full power!

1410
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:35,308
‐ Five G!

1411
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,482
No, six G!

1412
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:42,571
‐ Just a little more, Izumi!
(Ikumi humming)

1413
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:45,111
‐ [Male Crewman] What the hell
are those two freaks doing?

1414
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,685
‐ [Male Crewman] Supposedly,
they’re reenacting

1415
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:49,238
leaving the Earth’s atmosphere
in the style of old anime.

1416
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:50,663
(Izumi and Hikaru sighing)
‐ Oh.

1417
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:52,741
‐ Just to let you know,
shuttles in the 23rd century

1418
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:54,328
are comfortable and safe,

1419
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,411
thanks to the inclusion of
gravity control systems.

1420
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,246
‐ [Jun] Huh, ah!

1421
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:01,382
‐ We have reached
stationary satellite orbit.

1422
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,750
‐ Well, at least the flight
so far has been relatively‐‐

1423
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,208
‐ I would say unpleasant.

1424
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:07,258
‐ What are you talking about?

1425
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:09,431
Is there something wrong?

1426
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,639
‐ You knew all along she
would be onboard this shuttle,

1427
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:12,682
didn’t you?

1428
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:13,933
‐ Shiratori’s younger sister?

1429
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:15,014
Yes, I did.

1430
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,308
‐ Stupid!

1431
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,273
I don’t believe it,
why didn’t you tell me?

1432
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:20,813
‐ Because I wanted to
avoid unnecessary hassles

1433
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:21,768
before takeoff.

1434
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,105
‐ What was that?

1435
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:24,110
‐ Just listen.

1436
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,862
That girl is the younger sister

1437
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:28,073
of the hero to the
Jovian Federation.

1438
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:31,113
They might be after her
as their next target.

1439
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:33,778
It would be more dangerous
to leave her alone.

1440
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,027
‐ Oh?

1441
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,368
‐ Approaching escort
fleet, lunar rendezvous.

1442
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,832
‐ I am Araragi, commander
of the escort fleet,

1443
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,210
at your service.

1444
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,964
‐ I’m Ruri Hoshino,
captain of the Nadesico.

1445
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:49,467
We are very grateful
for your contribution.

1446
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:52,639
‐ Please, escorting a
jewel such as yourself,

1447
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,049
it is but our pleasure.

1448
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,557
‐ [Ruri] Uh?

1449
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:57,309
‐ [Araragi] A white flower
blooming in the black of space,

1450
00:57:57,391 --> 00:58:00,391
Ruri Hoshino, the
Cybernetic Fairy.

1451
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,477
That’s what the men
call you around here.

1452
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:05,692
Yes, you are truly
a sight to behold.

1453
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:07,066
‐ Uh, well, thank you.

1454
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,900
And please send my
greetings and regards

1455
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,567
to the rest of
your crew as well.

1456
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:15,333
‐ Cybernetic Fairy, she’s
adorable, isn’t she?

1457
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,620
‐ Yes, she is a
treasure in space.

1458
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:20,003
‐ And I recorded the
entire thing, sir.

1459
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:22,252
‐ Great, I’ll show it
to the others later.

1460
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:23,832
(alarm blaring)
‐ Huh?

1461
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:24,707
‐ [Male Technician] Rapid
increase of boson particles

1462
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,045
5,000 kilometers ahead!

1463
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,459
‐ What?

1464
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:29,546
(dramatic music)
‐ Enemy convoy, 12 o’clock.

1465
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:32,836
‐ Battleship frigate?
‐ Civilian shuttle.

1466
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,256
That’s our target.

1467
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,014
Behold, as this is truly the
covert operation’s vessel

1468
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:38,519
intelligence discovered.

1469
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,890
All units, strike
not the battleship,

1470
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:42,638
but strike the shuttle!

1471
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:43,768
‐ [Pilots] Aye!

1472
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:46,234
‐ Attention all escort
units, full speed ahead,

1473
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,146
diamond formation.

1474
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,863
‐ The shuttle will
accelerate ahead.

1475
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:51,445
‐ [Technicians] Huh?

1476
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:54,278
‐ Okay everyone, just leave
everything to the specialist.

1477
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,874
‐ Passengers and crew,
prepare for thrusters.

1478
00:58:56,992 --> 00:58:57,872
Put on your seat belts.

1479
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,451
‐ All right!

1480
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,656
So you want us to blast right
through the enemy barricade,

1481
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:03,458
or what?

1482
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,960
‐ Yes, just do your thing,

1483
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:06,542
and help us get out
of here, please.

1484
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:07,536
‐ Sure!

1485
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:10,457
(engine roaring)

1486
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,377
(electronic beeping)
‐ The shuttle’s on point.

1487
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:13,796
These fools must want to die!

1488
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:16,054
(weapons firing)

1489
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:18,508
‐ [Pilot] Field strength
holding steady at 80%.

1490
00:59:18,597 --> 00:59:19,847
Push it.

1491
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:20,931
‐ A little more, a little more!

1492
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:23,888
(weapons firing)

1493
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:30,023
‐ The enemy appears to
have lost their target.

1494
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,478
We will push through
their front line

1495
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,818
and act as the shuttle’s shield.

1496
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:35,074
Life in death’s grasp.

1497
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:36,745
Such a remarkable fairy.

1498

‐ [Male Technician]
Boson readings increasing

1499

00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:40,910
‐ [Araragi] What?

1501
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:42,286
(electronic warbling)

1502
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,162
‐ No good, we’ll be
flanked at this rate!

1503
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,747
‐ Oh no, this isn’t
what I bargained for!

1504
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:49,595
‐ Well, don’t we
have any weapons?

1505
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,421
‐ We took them off to
camouflage the ship.

1506
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:52,916
‐ Just had to be
thorough, didn’t you?

1507
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:53,876
(Minato chuckling)

1508
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,005
‐ Ah!

1509
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:57,432
‐ Undoubtedly, this is mutiny!

1510
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:59,761
In the eyes of the
United Earth Charter,

1511
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,256
we’re a threat to peace!

1512
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:02,928
They see evil.

1513
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,926
However, space‐time transference

1514
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,268
ushers the dawn of a new world,

1515
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:09,274
a new strength in space,

1516
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:11,226
a new vision of power and order!

1517
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:14,816
Now, light the way
for our heroes!

1518
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:19,238
‐ Image, image, image.

1519
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:26,294
Destination, Unified
Earth Headquarters.

‐ [Female Technician]
Navigators,

1522
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:31,377
continue with visualizations.

01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,711
‐ [Male Technician] Image
transfer rate at 50%.

1524
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:36,917
‐ Initiate transfer
enhancement program now.

1525
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,178

(light gentle music)

1528
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:50,983
(laughing)

1529
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:51,984
‐ Akito!

1530
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:56,986
Just tell me where
you want to go, Akito!

1531
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,990
(weapons firing)

1532
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:00,874
‐ Not so fast, pigs!

1533
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:07,753
(groaning)

1534
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:09,331
(vocalizing)

1535
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:11,326
‐ [Male Crewman] What are
those freaks up to now?

1536
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:12,879
‐ [Male Crewman]
Apparently, this time,

1537
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:14,803
they’re reenacting high
stress acceleration G‐force.

1538
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,260
‐ [Male Crewman] I don’t
know why they’re having

1539
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,169
such a good time.

1540
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:19,089
(explosions booming)

1541
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:20,966
‐ Boson reactions,
50 kilometers.

1542
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:21,972
‐ What?

1543
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:24,973
(electronic warbling)

1544
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:26,386
‐ [Pilot] This one is huge.

1545
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,596
‐ This looks like
nothing but trouble.

1546
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:29,685
Eh?

1547
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,809
‐ Now firing the
gravity blast cannon!

1548
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:32,687
(gasping)

1549
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,442
(heroic music)

(energy blasting)

1551
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:48,541
‐ [Pilot] Emergency!

1552
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:49,873
Leap!

1553
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,496
(pilot screaming)

1554
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:53,963
‐ Captain, Miss Minato,
did you just see all that?

1555
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:55,384
(Seiya chuckling)

1556
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:56,342
‐ [Passengers] What?

1557
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:58,051
‐ [Male Crewman] Chief?

1558
01:01:58,173 --> 01:01:59,303
‐ Hey, hey, everybody!

1559
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:00,682
How ya doin’?

1560
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:02,509
‐ Mr. Seiya, what
are you doing there?

1561
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:04,604
‐ Yeah, well, you know, I
thought this might happen.

1562
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,721
I’m just glad I got
here before you did.

1563
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,478
You can laugh this off as
being a little too convenient,

1564
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:12,269
but you can never keep me away
from all these new gizmos!

1565
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:15,055
Behold and long live technology!

1566
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,068
‐ His face has been defaced.

1567
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:17,441
Is that from his wife?

1568
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:21,072
‐ That’s the price of a
timely plot twist, I guess.

1569
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:24,534
‐ In any case, Mr. Seiya,
Harry, I’d like to know.

1570
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:25,986
‐ Huh?
‐ Yeah?

1571
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:28,236
‐ [Ruri] I want you to
explain how you got here.

1572
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:30,118
How did you boson jump?

1573
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:33,327
‐ Oh please, let me explain.

1574
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:36,786
(weapons firing)

1575
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,800
‐ Sir, they just came out
of nowhere without warning,

1576
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:39,962
and they‐‐

1577
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:42,970
(explosion booming)
(soldier screaming)

1578

(men gasping)

1580
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:48,767
‐ We’ve all finished this, sire.

1581
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:52,390
‐ Yes, the dawn of a new
order is soon to come.

1582
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:56,561
‐ [Men] Three, two, one, kaboom!

1583
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:01,445
‐ Get to know the Nadesico!

1584
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:03,108
(upbeat music)

1585
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:05,026
Hello, it’s been a while,
and it’s nice to meet you.

1586
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:08,035
I’m Inez Fressange, medical
and science crew officer

1587
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:09,698
of the Nadesico.

1588
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:12,616
The enemy is seeking hegemony
over politics, economics,

1589
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:14,326
entertainment,
morality and chastity

1590
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:15,957
in the new world
order ushered in

1591
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:18,344
with the arrival of the
era of boson jumping.

1592
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:19,961
That is their goal.

1593
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:21,006
So how can boson jumping‐‐

1594
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:21,961
‐ Question.

1595
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:23,300
‐ [Inez] Yes, what is it?

1596
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:26,473
‐ I believe everyone here has
the same thing on their mind.

1597
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:30,564
Didn’t you, I mean, weren’t
you killed or something?

1598
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,640
‐ [Hikaru] Yeah, man,
how come you’re not dead?

1599
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:34,266
‐ [Inez] Oh yes,
how rude, I’m sorry.

1600
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:35,482
Why am I alive?

1601
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,063
‐ How about I explain this one?

1602
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:39,147
‐ [Hikaru] Hey, it’s
that washed‐up womanizer!

1603
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:40,532
(laughing)

1604
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,150
‐ Ouch, low blow.

1605
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,815
But first, let me refute the
ugly rumors of me and this war.

1606
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:45,954
(Ryoko growling)

1607
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:47,411
‐ We don’t give a
rat’s ass about you!

1608
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,240
Just tell us what’s
going on here!

1609
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:52,496
‐ Hey there little
fella, weren’t you in
the Unified Forces?

1610
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:54,459
‐ Don’t change the
subject, you piece of shit!

1611
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:55,999
(laughing)

1612
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,672
‐ Well, in any case, sometimes
to trick your enemies,

1613
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:00,172
you have to trick your friends.

1614
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:03,173
You see, since both Tenkawa
and the captain were abducted,

1615
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:06,126
having her officially listed
as deceased, if you will,

1616
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:08,507
proved to be the most
effective step we could take.

1617
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:10,636
‐ Can I ask you a
personal question?

1618
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:11,642
‐ [Nagare] Shoot.

1619
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:13,223
‐ Mr. Akatsuki, tell me this.

1620
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,230
Are you a good guy or bad guy?

1621
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:16,602
(laughing)

1622
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,686
‐ You do get straight
to the point, don’t ya?

1623
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:20,272
Oops, I have a call
on the other line.

1624
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:21,817
See ya.

1625
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,150
Ooh, my goodness.
‐ This is the front gate!

1626
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:25,074
The enemy has shown no
signs of letting up, sir!

1627
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:27,205
‐ Easy, just leave it to me.

1628
01:04:27,322 --> 01:04:28,452
‐ Aye!

1629
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,831
‐ All right, the
stage has been set.

1630
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:31,949
Time to go.

1631
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:36,545
(explosions booming)
(weapons firing)

1632
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:37,834
‐ Enemy guard force is gone!

1633
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:40,206
‐ Right, then we attack now!

1634
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:41,465
(men yelling)

1635
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:42,554
‐ Huh?

1636
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:43,549
‐ [Men] Whoa!

1637
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:49,089
‐ Hey boys, what’s the hurry?

1638
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:50,549
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

1639
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:52,177
‐ Hot damn.

1640
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:54,723
‐ [Megumi] Hello everyone out
there, I’m Megumi Reinard!

1641
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:56,139
‐ [Girls] And we’re
the Howmei Girls!

1642
01:04:57,394 --> 01:04:58,734
‐ We’d like to
extend a warm welcome

1643
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:01,063
to everyone attending
tonight’s show.

1644
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,977
‐ And we hope everyone
has an awesome time!

1645
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:06,277
(crowd cheering)

1646
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:07,613
‐ What is this?

1647
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:10,027
Where in God’s name is
the General Assembly?

1648
01:05:10,115 --> 01:05:12,415
‐ Mr. Pros on guitar!
‐ Yeah, baby!

1649
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:14,242
‐ [Megumi] Yoshido
Munetake on the bass!

1650
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:15,867
‐ Far out.

1651
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:18,374
‐ [Howmei Girl] And there’s
Miss Howmei tickling the keys!

1652
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:20,286
(both grunting and shouting)

1653
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:21,577
‐ [Megumi] And on drums,

1654
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:24,589
Kouichiro Misumara and
Genpachiro Akiyama!

1655
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:26,382
‐ And our special guest is‐‐

1656
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,054
‐ Nagare Akatsuki!

1657
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:32,184
(crowd cheering)

1658
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,680
‐ Dagnabbit!

1659
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:39,266
Hey everybody,
welcome to the show.

1660
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:40,984
(crowd cheering)
‐ Kill him!

1661
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:43,194
(guns firing)

1662
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:45,023
‐ He’s got a distortion field!

1663
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:47,568
‐ Never underestimate
the stinkin’ rich.

1664
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,902
‐ Bastards, what is
the meaning of this?

1665
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:51,198
‐ Oh, this?

1666
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:53,281
This means the end to
your foolish undertakings.

1667
01:05:53,408 --> 01:05:54,908
‐ [Kawaguchi] What?

1668
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:57,293
‐ Nobody who tries to hold
the General Assembly hostage

1669
01:05:57,412 --> 01:05:59,502
will ever take the world.

1670
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:01,832
Come on, there’s no
need for you to die.

1671
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:07,052
‐ [Kawaguchi] Then
we can kill you.

1672
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:16,716
‐ [Pilot] Traitor Nagare
Akatsuki, receive your doom.

1673
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:20,056
(electronic whirring)

1674
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:27,265
(men gasping)

1675
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:29,188
‐ [Genichiro] Your forces
outside have been neutralized.

1676
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:31,029
Surrender.

1677
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:32,244
‐ Boson jumper.

1678
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:33,612
Some new model.

1679
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:37,793
‐ It’s been some
time, eh, Kawaguchi?

1680
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:40,503
‐ Commander?

1681
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:43,172
‐ I just heart Ruri made
it to the Nadesico‐C.

1682
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:44,329
‐ [Akito] Then it’s done.

1683
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:45,959
‐ Yes.

1684
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:48,714
Once she joins and becomes one
with the Omoikane’s system,

1685
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,758
they will be utterly invincible.

1686
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,880
‐ So the data we collected
was worth all the fighting.

1687
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,930
‐ You’re going, aren’t you?
‐ Yes.

1688
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:58,180
‐ Revenge.

1689
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:00,314
It’s a word no one would
have ever associated

1690
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:02,181
with Akito in the past.

1691
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:04,898
‐ [Akito] That was
the past, this is now.

1692
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,271
Thanks for the refueling.

1693
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:07,306
‐ It’s nothing.

1694
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:12,186
I’m just here running errands
for the Chairman anyway.

1695
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:14,488
‐ Cancel all hits?

1696
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:15,662
Why is that?

1697
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:16,990
Explain this!

1698
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:19,295
‐ Uh, well sir, the
enemy’s new weapons

1699
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:20,449
and, uh, persuasions‐‐

1700
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:21,787
‐ Persuasions?
(men gasping)

1701
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,871
‐ Tsukumo Shiratori
is rolling in his‐‐

1702
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:25,998
‐ Tsukiomi?
‐ He was still alive?

1703
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:28,004
‐ [Man] Boson readings
directly above!

1704
01:07:28,086 --> 01:07:28,706
‐ What?

1705
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:31,845
(heroic music)

1706
01:07:31,923 --> 01:07:35,343
(electricity crackling)

1707
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,178
‐ [Male Technician]
We have a visual, sir.

1708
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:44,058
It’s the Nadesico!

1709
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:46,813
‐ Nadesico?
(all gasping)

1710
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,530
‐ [Pilot] All unis are ordered
to stay at their posts!

1711
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:53,740
‐ [Pilot] It’s not our fault,

1712
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:55,321
the machines are moving
on their own, sir!

1713
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:57,165
‐ Doing what?

1714
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,410
(pilot gasping)

1715
01:07:58,491 --> 01:07:59,451
‐ [Male Technician] We’re
losing control, sir!

1716
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:00,696
We’re losing control!

1717
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:06,787
‐ The system’s been hijacked.

1718
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,076
By the Fairy.

1719
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:15,383
‐ [Minato] Phase
transition engine,

1720
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:16,756
no abnormalities reported.

1721
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:18,053
‐ [Hikaru] All stations,

1722
01:08:18,136 --> 01:08:20,676
please shift to alert
status pattern B.

1723
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:22,683
‐ [Ruri] Harry, prepare
to take control of

1724
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:25,095
all the Nadesico’s
operating system.

1725
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:26,016
‐ Huh?

1726
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,272
All of ’em?

1727
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:29,115
You mean I won’t just
be running the backup?

1728
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:30,438
‐ No.

1729
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:32,613
I will be taking control of
all enemy systems on Mars

1730
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:34,614
and I cannot control
the Nadesico as well.

1731
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:37,454
The Nadesico‐C will
be all yours, Harry.

1732
01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:38,822
This is your chance.

1733
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:41,533
‐ B‐but I‐‐

1734
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:43,368
‐ I just know you
can do it, Harry.

1735
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:45,043
‐ [Harry] Huh?

1736
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:47,121
‐ Anyway, you owe Ruri for all
that pampering she gave you.

1737
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:50,878
‐ [Inez] So then Ruri took
control of all of the units

1738
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:51,790
in and around Mars?

1739
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:54,844
She really is something.

1740
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,174
‐ How are you feeling after
all that, Miss Fressange?

1741
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,340
‐ I’m fine, but
it’s no easy task

1742
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:02,469
to jump an entire battleship
to Mars in a single leap.

1743
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:03,677
‐ I’m sure.

1744
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:04,886
‐ So this is the
new world order?

1745
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:09,313
‐ Good evening to everyone.

1746
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:10,977
I am Ruri Hoshino,

1747
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:13,824
captain of the United Earth
Space Fleet’s Nadesico‐C.

1748
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:17,531
Former Jovian Federation
Vice Admiral Kusakabe,

1749
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:19,284
you are under arrest.

1750
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:21,824
‐ Silence, vile witch!

1751
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:23,448
(men shouting)
‐ We will never,

1752
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:27,044
ever slow down, we will
fight to the death!

1753
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,543
‐ I want your word that
all of my subordinates

1754
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:29,866
will be taken care of.

1755
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,960
(electronic warbling)

1756
01:09:37,048 --> 01:09:38,418
‐ [Hikaru] Boson
readings at seven.

1757
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:40,258
‐ [Minato] Ruriruri?

1758
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:41,343
‐ [Ruri] Don’t bother.

1759
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:42,259
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

1760
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:43,435
‐ Everything’s okay.

1761
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:45,143
We’ll leave it all to him.

1762
01:09:48,643 --> 01:09:50,273
‐ [Pilot] Are you sure, sir?

1763
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:52,103
‐ Surprise attacks
involving jumping

1764
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:53,648
are a double‐edged sword.

1765
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:55,191
With the Amaterasu
out of the picture,

1766
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,534
our chances of victory
were about 50/50,

1767
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:00,200
but once a Class A jumper was
revealed to be still alive,

1768
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:04,069
our chances suddenly‐‐
(electronic beeping)

1769
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:19,877
The time has come to
put an end to this.

1770
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:28,465
(dramatic music)

1771
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:31,228
(weapons firing)

1772
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:36,984
(explosions booming)

1773
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:46,740
‐ [Ruri] My name is Ruri, and
this is my friend Omoikane.

1774
01:10:46,826 --> 01:10:48,486
Who are you?

1775
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:49,618
‐ [Lapis] Lapis.

1776
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:50,746
‐ [Ruri] Lapis?

1777
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:52,002
Lapis Lazuli?

1778
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:55,627
‐ [Lapis] I was born in
the Nergal laboratory.

1779
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:58,842
I am Akito’s eyes, Akito’s ears,

1780
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:01,761
Akito’s hands, Akito’s feet,

1781
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:04,341
Akito’s, Akito’s‐‐

1782
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:07,427
(explosions booming)

1783
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:17,479
(dramatic music)
(energy blasting)

1784
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:32,294
‐ I sense your fear.

1785
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:34,673
No matter how strong
the armor you don,

1786
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:37,541
the weakness within your
heart will always be exposed.

1787
01:11:39,504 --> 01:11:42,214
(Akito grunting)

1788
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:47,304
(weapons firing)

1789
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:49,013
‐ [Saburota] Sir!

1790
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:53,103
‐ In comes the cavalry!

1791
01:11:53,184 --> 01:11:54,814
Better stay out of
this duel, boys,

1792
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:56,404
or else this horse is
gonna kick your ass

1793
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:57,559
into the River Styx!

1794
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:59,057
‐ I’m the number one horse!

1795
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:01,358
(Hikaru neighing)
‐ And me, number two.

1796
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:03,284
‐ Well, I guess that
makes me a horse too.

1797
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:04,951
‐ That’s right, all settled up!

1798
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:07,659
‐ I think Ryoko
might need a ride.

1799
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:08,662
‐ Hey, that’s good.

1800
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:10,661
‐ Nobody’s riding anybody!

1801
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:12,203
‐ Oops.

1802
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:13,828
Well ladies, I suppose we’ll
just have to wait ’til later

1803
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:15,663
to see who’s riding who.

1804
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:17,000
‐ [Ryoko] Can it, jackass!

1805
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:19,633
‐ [Izumi] Just listen
to those sweet nothings.

1806
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:20,540
‐ Careful, men!

1807
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:23,050
They but they’re crackshots!

1808
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:28,182
(explosion booming)
(pilot screaming)

1809
01:12:31,806 --> 01:12:34,056
(explosions booming)

1810
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,773
‐ It’s amazing how
far you’ve gotten.

1811
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:38,153
A testament of true persistence.

1812
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:41,364
‐ It’s over.

1813
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:45,570
‐ [Ryoko] Goddamn it,
stop screwing around!

1814
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:47,155
‐ [Hikaru] We’re
fighting, we’re fighting!

1815
01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:48,738
‐ [Izumi] Oh, serious fighting?

1816
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:50,825
Then I’ll start fighting.

1817
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:52,698
(pilot screaming)

1818
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:54,535
‐ Let’s see what you’ve got.

1819
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:59,325
(explosions booming)

1820
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:06,013
(electricity crackling)

1821
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:11,719
(gagging)

1822
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:12,764
Remarkable...

1823
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:23,020
(breathing heavily)

1824
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:41,376
(grumbling)

1825
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:44,667
‐ What‐what happened?

1826
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:47,800
You’re all so old.

1827
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:49,134
(all sighing)

1828
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:51,678
‐ [Inez] Oh thank God,
you’re still clueless.

1829
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:54,181
‐ I just had the craziest dream.

1830
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:55,182
Akito?

1831
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:57,933
Where’s Akito?

1832
01:13:58,059 --> 01:14:00,059
(dramatic music)

1833
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:03,440
‐ Goodbye!

1834
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,694
You sure it’s a good
idea to let ’em go?

1835
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:10,777
‐ If he says he needs to go,
there’s nothing we can do.

1836
01:14:10,905 --> 01:14:12,205
‐ Oh.

1837
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,581
What do you think he’s
going to do from now on?

1838
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:17,285
‐ He’ll come back.

1839
01:14:18,746 --> 01:14:21,116
And if he doesn’t, then
I’ll just go out after him.

1840
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:24,706
‐ [Minato] Ruriruri?

1841
01:14:24,794 --> 01:14:26,134
‐ Because Akito...

1842
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:29,208
Because he’s a special
person to all of us.
