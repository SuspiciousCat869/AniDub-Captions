[STAFF A] Commander Sorbet.

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:22.275 position:24% line:89% align:start
[SORBET] What now?

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.244 position:5% line:89% align:start
[STAFF A] It's Planet 448, sir.

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:26.045 position:21% line:83% align:start
The native uprising
has gotten worse.

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.281 position:24% line:83% align:start
We can't keep them
down for much longer.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.316 position:30% line:83% align:start
[SORBET] Fine.
Then send more soldiers.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.619 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STAFF A]
That's the trouble, sir.

00:02:31.652 --> 00:02:33.386 position:19% line:83% align:start
With all the fighting
on other worlds,

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.155 position:10% line:89% align:start
we barely have any to spare.

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:37.023 position:41% line:89% align:start

This is Sorbet. Report.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.578 position:27% line:83% align:start
Have you tracked
down the remaining

00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:00.346 position:16% line:89% align:start
Namekian survivors yet?

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.714 position:30% line:83% align:start
[SUBORDINATE]
I'm sorry, Commander.

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:04.116 position:19% line:83% align:start
We've deployed a small
army of spy drones,

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:05.652 position:27% line:83% align:start
but they haven't
turned up anything.

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:07.654 position:13% line:89% align:start
We still can't find them.

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:11.256 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well then. There's no choice,
we'll go to Earth.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.460 position:10% line:83% align:start
Planet Earth? But isn't that
a bit too dangerous, sir?

00:03:14.493 --> 00:03:15.762 position:33% line:83% align:start
I know they
have Dragon Balls

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:17.496 position:27% line:83% align:start
and that female
knows how to find them,

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:19.465 position:21% line:83% align:start
but she's in league
with the Super Saiyan!

00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:22.167 position:5% line:83% align:start
[SORBET] Without the Namekians,
what else can we do?

00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:24.436 position:27% line:83% align:start
Earth is a risk
we have to take.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.071 position:27% line:83% align:start
Besides, I have
no intention of

00:03:26.104 --> 00:03:27.573 position:10% line:89% align:start
involving that human woman.

00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:30.075 position:16% line:83% align:start
Our spy drones may have
failed in other systems,

00:03:30.108 --> 00:03:31.477 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SORBET] but they've
helped on Earth.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.745 position:16% line:83% align:start
According to their data,
she's not the only one

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:36.348 position:24% line:83% align:start
capable of finding
Dragon Balls.

00:03:36.381 --> 00:03:37.316 position:27% line:89% align:start
[STAFF A] Uh...

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.220 position:19% line:83% align:start
Tagoma! The two of us
are going to Earth.

00:03:41.253 --> 00:03:44.356 position:13% line:83% align:start
Sir! But why not send out
a larger unit, sir?

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:45.724 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:03:45.757 --> 00:03:48.025 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SORBET] It seems the
Earth Saiyans can detect

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:51.229 position:16% line:83% align:start
substantial power levels
without using a Scouter.

00:03:51.262 --> 00:03:55.500 position:7% line:83% align:start
Obviously, more troops means a
bigger risk of being noticed.

00:03:55.534 --> 00:03:58.302 position:27% line:83% align:start
Understood, sir.
We'll get the job done.

00:03:58.336 --> 00:03:59.604 position:30% line:83% align:start
But Commander,
are you sure you want to

00:03:59.638 --> 00:04:01.239 position:16% line:89% align:start
go down there yourself?

00:04:01.272 --> 00:04:02.640 position:21% line:89% align:start
Of course I'm sure.

[TAGOMA] Commander Sorbet,
look! I've found them.

00:04:22.226 --> 00:04:23.427 position:21% line:89% align:start
[SORBET] Excellent.

00:04:23.461 --> 00:04:25.496 position:10% line:83% align:start
[TAGOMA] Looks like they've
already gathered six of them.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.732 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SORBET] Then what are you
waiting for? Let's move!

00:04:27.765 --> 00:04:30.066 position:19% line:83% align:start
We have to catch them
before they've got them all!

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.369 position:24% line:89% align:start
[TAGOMA] Yes, sir!

00:04:31.402 --> 00:04:34.337 position:35% line:89% align:start
[beeping]

00:04:34.371 --> 00:04:37.808 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SORBET] Don't disappoint me.
You said the last one was here.

00:04:37.842 --> 00:04:39.677 position:24% line:83% align:start
Uh. That's right.
The ball should be

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.311 position:13% line:89% align:start
directly below this spot.

00:04:41.344 --> 00:04:42.847 position:24% line:83% align:start
Of course, that's
where it gets tricky.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.481 position:24% line:83% align:start
The ocean floor's
really deep here

00:04:44.514 --> 00:04:47.117 position:16% line:83% align:start
so we'll need some kind
of submersible.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.854 position:27% line:83% align:start
[SORBET] Tagoma,
dive down and retrieve it.

00:04:49.887 --> 00:04:51.454 position:27% line:89% align:start
[TAGOMA] Right!

00:04:55.425 --> 00:04:58.094 position:7% line:89% align:start
[MAI] We'll, uh, be over here.

00:04:58.128 --> 00:04:59.095 position:33% line:89% align:start

00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:03.333 position:24% line:83% align:start
Mai! This is your
fault for not moving

00:05:03.366 --> 00:05:04.868 position:33% line:83% align:start
quick enough
with the Dragon Radar!

00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:07.370 position:10% line:83% align:start
Now these crazy alien jerks
are gonna snatch 'em all up

00:05:07.404 --> 00:05:09.439 position:21% line:83% align:start
and steal the wishes
that should be ours!

00:05:09.472 --> 00:05:10.807 position:44% line:83% align:start
You're the one who
said we cooperate,

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.107 position:41% line:83% align:start
you should've
just told 'em "no"!

00:05:12.141 --> 00:05:13.175 position:24% line:83% align:start
Here's what we're
gonna do now.

00:05:13.208 --> 00:05:14.310 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're gonna take your gun,

00:05:14.344 --> 00:05:16.312 position:13% line:83% align:start
and you're gonna whip out
that pretty little sword.

00:05:16.345 --> 00:05:17.514 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then chop-chop-chop-
pow-pow-pow

00:05:17.547 --> 00:05:18.615 position:19% line:89% align:start
and they're finished!

00:05:18.648 --> 00:05:19.516 position:30% line:83% align:start
--[MAI] What?
--[SHOU] Wait.

00:05:19.549 --> 00:05:20.817 position:5% line:83% align:start
If we're trying to
beat 'em then shouldn't

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:21.885 position:5% line:89% align:start
you attack, too?

00:05:21.918 --> 00:05:24.353 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm supposed to be
the brains of this operation!

00:05:24.386 --> 00:05:26.756 position:13% line:89% align:start
But very well. Let's roll!

I'm small doesn't mean

00:05:36.632 --> 00:05:38.701 position:27% line:83% align:start
you should take
me lightly, Earthlings.

what's wrong?

now that you mention it.

get on with it.

Look. After we do this,

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.500 position:16% line:83% align:start
are you the kind of guy
who's gonna kill us?

Don't you worry, Earthling.

Yes. Of course.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:09.392 position:24% line:83% align:start
Whatever you think
is best, my lord.

00:15:14.364 --> 00:15:15.898 position:75% line:89% align:start
Ah-ahh!

00:15:16.732 --> 00:15:18.468 position:7% line:83% align:start
[FRIEZA] Just as I suspected,
my skills have grown

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:21.036 position:7% line:89% align:start
a bit rusty around the edges.

00:15:21.069 --> 00:15:23.038 position:21% line:83% align:start
It seems I may need
to wait a tad longer

00:15:23.071 --> 00:15:25.274 position:27% line:83% align:start
before exacting
my sweet revenge.

00:15:25.307 --> 00:15:27.443 position:16% line:89% align:start
Uh... Your revenge, sir?

00:15:27.477 --> 00:15:29.111 position:30% line:83% align:start
Don't tell me
you're surprised.

00:15:29.144 --> 00:15:31.280 position:19% line:83% align:start
Of course my vengeance
must be satisfied!

00:15:31.313 --> 00:15:34.483 position:7% line:83% align:start
I won't rest until both those
Super Simians are vanquished!

00:15:34.516 --> 00:15:35.984 position:27% line:83% align:start
They'll pay for
what they did to me

00:15:36.018 --> 00:15:37.419 position:13% line:89% align:start
and they'll pay in blood!

00:15:37.452 --> 00:15:39.388 position:24% line:83% align:start
Forgive me if I'm
speaking out of turn.

00:15:39.421 --> 00:15:41.356 position:24% line:83% align:start
But wouldn't it be
wiser to forget about

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:42.891 position:19% line:89% align:start
the Saiyans, my lord?

00:15:42.925 --> 00:15:45.327 position:27% line:83% align:start
And focus on the
rest of the Universe?

the most cowardly of my troops

00:16:30.304 --> 00:16:32.173 position:19% line:83% align:start
to my welcoming party,
or the Frieza Force

00:16:32.206 --> 00:16:34.275 position:21% line:83% align:start
has become woefully
faint of heart.

00:16:34.308 --> 00:16:36.310 position:16% line:83% align:start
How do you expect us to
run an Empire that strikes

00:16:36.344 --> 00:16:38.312 position:16% line:83% align:start
fear across the galaxies
while we're cowering from

00:16:38.346 --> 00:16:40.281 position:10% line:89% align:start
a handful of Saiyan garbage?

00:16:40.314 --> 00:16:41.848 position:30% line:89% align:start
But--But sir.

00:16:41.881 --> 00:16:43.351 position:24% line:83% align:start
That Saiyan, Goku,
has gone through

00:16:43.384 --> 00:16:44.918 position:33% line:83% align:start
a great deal
while you were gone.

00:16:44.951 --> 00:16:47.887 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's faced all sorts
of foes and prevailed.

00:16:47.921 --> 00:16:49.222 position:16% line:89% align:start
What are you telling me?

00:16:49.256 --> 00:16:52.058 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's more formidable now
than when he bested me?

00:16:52.092 --> 00:16:53.494 position:27% line:89% align:start
Uh... Yes, sir.

00:16:53.527 --> 00:16:56.263 position:10% line:83% align:start
I know that's hard to hear,
but it's the truth.

00:16:56.296 --> 00:16:58.265 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:16:58.298 --> 00:17:00.433 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'd expect nothing less
from that monkey.

00:17:00.467 --> 00:17:02.802 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll just have to
become stronger myself.

00:17:02.836 --> 00:17:04.271 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's as simple as that.

00:17:04.304 --> 00:17:06.473 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SORBET] But my lord,
he even beat Majin Buu!

00:17:06.506 --> 00:17:08.408 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's the last battle
our drones recorded.

00:17:08.441 --> 00:17:10.143 position:7% line:89% align:start
Who knows if there were more!

00:17:10.944 --> 00:17:11.978 position:35% line:89% align:start
[whimpers]

00:17:12.012 --> 00:17:12.912 position:13% line:83% align:start
[FRIEZA] Father once said
there were two warriors

00:17:12.946 --> 00:17:15.215 position:27% line:83% align:start
in the Universe
I was never to challenge.

00:17:15.248 --> 00:17:17.916 position:21% line:83% align:start
Beerus the Destroyer
and Majin Buu.

00:17:17.951 --> 00:17:20.120 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're telling me
Goku beat that Buu?

00:17:20.153 --> 00:17:21.987 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh... Yes sir.

00:17:22.021 --> 00:17:24.890 position:16% line:83% align:start
[FRIEZA] Then he's even
mightier than I dared to dream.

00:17:24.923 --> 00:17:27.960 position:30% line:83% align:start
This could be
most salubrious for me.

00:17:27.993 --> 00:17:30.363 position:27% line:83% align:start
Uh. I'm not sure
I know that word, sir.

00:17:30.397 --> 00:17:33.500 position:16% line:83% align:start
It means beneficial to a
person's health and well-being.

00:17:33.533 --> 00:17:35.468 position:19% line:83% align:start
And what could be more
salubrious for a conqueror

00:17:35.502 --> 00:17:37.437 position:21% line:83% align:start
than the motivation
to become so strong

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:39.371 position:10% line:89% align:start
he's never dethroned again?

00:17:39.405 --> 00:17:42.141 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SORBET]
Um, as you say, my lord.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.545 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've never trained
a day in my life.

00:17:46.578 --> 00:17:47.781 position:38% line:83% align:start
[FRIEZA]
There was never a need.

00:17:47.813 --> 00:17:51.984 position:10% line:83% align:start
Imagine what could happen if
I unlock my latent potential.

00:17:52.017 --> 00:17:55.087 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hold on. You mean,
you could get stronger?

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.889 position:7% line:89% align:start
Stronger than your final form?

00:17:56.922 --> 00:18:00.092 position:19% line:83% align:start
Of course, my minion.
Now shut your gaping mouth

00:18:00.125 --> 00:18:01.593 position:19% line:89% align:start
so I can concentrate.

00:18:01.627 --> 00:18:04.862 position:7% line:83% align:start
[FRIEZA] If I train in earnest
for the next four months...

00:18:04.896 --> 00:18:07.232 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yes. I could reach
a power level of

00:18:07.266 --> 00:18:09.435 position:16% line:89% align:start
one-point-three million.

the Earth is in danger!

How 'bout I show you
my beautiful goldfish?

00:18:57.715 --> 00:18:59.617 position:21% line:89% align:start
A fish made of gold?

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.625 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wow, those eyes are
more like what you see

00:19:07.658 --> 00:19:09.259 position:16% line:89% align:start
in an Erukan bull frog.

00:19:09.292 --> 00:19:11.228 position:21% line:83% align:start

What brings you
down to our planet?

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.316 position:13% line:83% align:start
I had an interesting talk
with your sister, Tights.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:35.050 position:21% line:83% align:start
She tells me you're
buddies with the man who

00:19:35.084 --> 00:19:37.220 position:7% line:89% align:start
defeated Frieza. Is that true?

00:19:37.254 --> 00:19:39.356 position:21% line:83% align:start
Huh? Well, I guess,
technically there are

00:19:39.389 --> 00:19:41.123 position:35% line:83% align:start
two people
who've beaten Frieza.

00:19:41.157 --> 00:19:43.493 position:19% line:83% align:start
The first, of course,
was my teenage son, Trunks.

00:19:43.527 --> 00:19:46.530 position:16% line:83% align:start
And the other person was
our old family friend, Goku.

00:19:46.563 --> 00:19:47.531 position:69% line:89% align:start
Your son?

00:19:47.564 --> 00:19:49.699 position:5% line:83% align:start
Granted I hadn't given
birth to him at that point

00:19:49.733 --> 00:19:51.668 position:5% line:83% align:start
'cause he came from the
future in a time machine.

00:19:51.701 --> 00:19:53.637 position:5% line:83% align:start
Right now he's
a cute little boy.

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:57.173 position:16% line:83% align:start
The future? You tell me
that like it's no big deal!

00:19:57.206 --> 00:19:59.575 position:13% line:83% align:start
Galactic law specifically
states altering time

00:19:59.608 --> 00:20:01.010 position:21% line:89% align:start
is a serious felony!

00:20:01.043 --> 00:20:03.078 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well then those laws
are clearly stupid.

00:20:03.112 --> 00:20:04.280 position:27% line:83% align:start
Look, let's not
get sidetracked.

00:20:04.313 --> 00:20:06.582 position:13% line:83% align:start
The reason I'm really here
is to see this friend of yours

00:20:06.615 --> 00:20:09.685 position:10% line:83% align:start
who's beaten Frieza. I have
grave news to tell him!

00:20:09.718 --> 00:20:12.154 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yeah, that's not
happening today, Jaco.

00:20:12.188 --> 00:20:14.089 position:10% line:83% align:start
Right now he and my husband
are on some planet

00:20:14.123 --> 00:20:16.425 position:21% line:83% align:start
doing who knows what
with Lord Beerus.

00:20:16.459 --> 00:20:18.093 position:33% line:89% align:start
Lord Beerus?

00:20:18.127 --> 00:20:20.061 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, come on. You're in
the Galactic Patrol

00:20:20.094 --> 00:20:21.297 position:13% line:89% align:start
and you don't know Beerus?

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:22.698 position:13% line:89% align:start
Lord Beerus the Destroyer!

00:20:22.731 --> 00:20:24.500 position:27% line:83% align:start
They're friends
with Lord Beerus?

00:20:24.533 --> 00:20:25.501 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:20:25.534 --> 00:20:27.470 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's impossible!
You can't be friends with

00:20:27.503 --> 00:20:30.004 position:21% line:83% align:start
someone who doesn't
actually exist!

00:20:30.038 --> 00:20:32.207 position:16% line:83% align:start
Think that if you want,
but it's your funeral.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.743 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't have time to debate
cosmic theology with you!

00:20:34.777 --> 00:20:38.046 position:5% line:83% align:start
Frieza's been resurrected and is
on his way to Earth as we speak!

00:20:38.079 --> 00:20:39.648 position:16% line:89% align:start
He's got a thousand men!

00:20:39.682 --> 00:20:41.549 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh? He's alive again?

00:20:41.583 --> 00:20:43.651 position:13% line:83% align:start
The same Frieza who put me
through all of that trouble

00:20:43.686 --> 00:20:45.119 position:19% line:89% align:start
back on Planet Namek?

00:20:45.153 --> 00:20:46.454 position:30% line:83% align:start
Though I never
actually met the guy--

00:20:46.488 --> 00:20:48.156 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm not sure
what he looked like.

00:20:50.158 --> 00:20:51.726 position:19% line:89% align:start
I did a quick sketch.

00:20:53.261 --> 00:20:55.330 position:27% line:83% align:start

00:26:57.483 --> 00:26:58.818 position:30% line:89% align:start
[VEGETA yells]

00:27:05.424 --> 00:27:06.693 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:27:06.726 --> 00:27:08.061 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:27:13.633 --> 00:27:14.968 position:35% line:89% align:start
[WHIS] Hm.

00:27:20.572 --> 00:27:23.375 position:33% line:89% align:start
[GOKU yells]

00:27:29.148 --> 00:27:30.682 position:27% line:89% align:start
[WHIS] Easy now.

00:27:31.583 --> 00:27:33.452 position:27% line:89% align:start
I-I can't move.

00:27:33.485 --> 00:27:35.053 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aah!

00:27:35.087 --> 00:27:37.623 position:27% line:89% align:start
[yells, groans]

00:27:40.092 --> 00:27:42.027 position:27% line:89% align:start
[VEGETA grunts]

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.729 position:30% line:89% align:start
[VEGETA] Haaa!

00:27:43.762 --> 00:27:45.163 position:35% line:83% align:start
Who's got
the upper hand now?

00:27:53.038 --> 00:27:55.506 position:21% line:83% align:start
Okay, boys, I think
we're done for now.

00:28:00.544 --> 00:28:02.080 position:19% line:89% align:start
[BOTH breath heavily]

00:28:02.114 --> 00:28:03.148 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm quite disappointed.

00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:06.051 position:10% line:83% align:start
Neither of you yet possesses
the necessary speed.

00:28:06.084 --> 00:28:08.753 position:21% line:83% align:start
Look. I even signed
both your tops!

00:28:08.786 --> 00:28:11.189 position:33% line:83% align:start
[GOKU] What?
When did you do that?

00:28:11.223 --> 00:28:13.624 position:16% line:83% align:start
[WHIS] You two are still
thinking before you move,

00:28:13.658 --> 00:28:15.526 position:16% line:89% align:start
rather than just moving.

00:28:15.559 --> 00:28:17.162 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid this habit
is especially strong

00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:18.796 position:24% line:89% align:start
with you, Vegeta.

00:28:18.829 --> 00:28:21.999 position:21% line:83% align:start
This overthinking is
limiting your fighting speed.

00:28:22.033 --> 00:28:23.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
[WHIS] Messages can
only travel through

00:28:23.668 --> 00:28:25.569 position:10% line:89% align:start
your nervous system so fast.

00:28:25.603 --> 00:28:27.638 position:13% line:83% align:start
When you rely on thoughts
for physical action

00:28:27.672 --> 00:28:29.140 position:5% line:89% align:start
you lose precious fighting time.

00:28:29.173 --> 00:28:30.274 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:28:30.308 --> 00:28:32.543 position:19% line:83% align:start
You really do like to
overthink everything, Vegeta.

00:28:32.576 --> 00:28:33.611 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, shut your face!

00:28:33.644 --> 00:28:36.113 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're only thinking less
because you're an idiot!

00:28:36.147 --> 00:28:38.816 position:16% line:83% align:start
Your end goal should be
to master the ability

00:28:38.849 --> 00:28:41.118 position:21% line:83% align:start
to have each part of
your body think and move

00:28:41.152 --> 00:28:42.954 position:30% line:83% align:start
independently
of the other parts.

00:28:42.987 --> 00:28:45.122 position:16% line:83% align:start
[WHIS] But I admit this
is exceedingly difficult.

00:28:45.156 --> 00:28:47.091 position:24% line:83% align:start
In fact, not even
Lord Beerus has mastered it,

00:28:47.124 --> 00:28:49.060 position:27% line:89% align:start
and he's a god.

00:28:49.093 --> 00:28:50.827 position:13% line:83% align:start
[WHIS] If you can overcome
the learning curve,

00:28:50.861 --> 00:28:53.863 position:16% line:83% align:start
you'll be able to avoid
any danger, however severe.

00:28:54.764 --> 00:28:56.900 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, allow me to take
you through every step

00:28:56.933 --> 00:29:00.171 position:13% line:83% align:start
of the training required,
in a most meticulous fashion.

00:29:00.204 --> 00:29:02.706 position:27% line:83% align:start
In exchange for
delicious foods, of course.

00:29:02.739 --> 00:29:05.909 position:13% line:83% align:start
You mean your body reacts
without you having to think?

00:29:05.942 --> 00:29:07.844 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's exactly right!

00:29:07.877 --> 00:29:09.579 position:38% line:83% align:start
But, uh,
Mister Whis, it looks like

00:29:09.612 --> 00:29:11.214 position:13% line:89% align:start
you stepped in some poop.

00:29:12.182 --> 00:29:13.583 position:38% line:89% align:start
[yells]

00:29:13.616 --> 00:29:15.085 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ew, ew, ew!

00:29:15.118 --> 00:29:16.519 position:24% line:89% align:start
[laughs nervously]

00:29:16.553 --> 00:29:18.021 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well my feet do think
for themselves,

00:29:18.054 --> 00:29:20.056 position:24% line:83% align:start
but I said nothing
about my shoes.

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:20.991 position:27% line:89% align:start
[clears throat]

00:29:21.024 --> 00:29:22.826 position:24% line:83% align:start
Anyway, let's get
back to you, Vegeta.

00:29:22.859 --> 00:29:23.827 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah, what about me?

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.829 position:19% line:83% align:start
[WHIS] You are clearly
an extraordinary fighter

00:29:25.862 --> 00:29:27.163 position:19% line:89% align:start
on your own. And yet,

00:29:27.197 --> 00:29:28.798 position:21% line:83% align:start
for whatever reason,
you're always

00:29:28.832 --> 00:29:30.967 position:27% line:83% align:start
one step behind
Goku, am I right?

00:29:31.001 --> 00:29:33.769 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, you just had to
bring that up didn't you?

00:29:33.802 --> 00:29:35.871 position:27% line:83% align:start
Do you know why
you're Goku's lesser?

00:29:35.905 --> 00:29:37.840 position:27% line:83% align:start
Please teach me,
oh-wise one.

00:29:37.873 --> 00:29:39.942 position:13% line:83% align:start
You walk through life with
a chip on your shoulder,

00:29:39.975 --> 00:29:41.710 position:27% line:83% align:start
and your nerves
wound too tight.

00:29:41.744 --> 00:29:43.179 position:24% line:83% align:start
This tension makes
it hard for you to move

00:29:43.213 --> 00:29:45.281 position:24% line:83% align:start
and fight at your
full potential.

00:29:45.315 --> 00:29:48.050 position:13% line:83% align:start
[WHIS] And so, your first
lesson is learning to relax.

00:29:48.083 --> 00:29:50.085 position:19% line:83% align:start
When there's a chance
to rest, you must take it.

00:29:50.119 --> 00:29:51.086 position:27% line:89% align:start
Like Goku does.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:54.623 position:16% line:83% align:start
[laughs] Whis is right.
I do love me a good nap.

00:29:54.656 --> 00:29:56.158 position:38% line:83% align:start
But you
have problems, too.

00:29:56.191 --> 00:29:57.292 position:35% line:89% align:start
[stutters]

00:29:57.326 --> 00:29:59.028 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ooh!

00:29:59.061 --> 00:30:01.864 position:30% line:89% align:start
[GOKU groans]

00:30:01.897 --> 00:30:05.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
What was that for?
That was a total sucker punch!

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.836 position:19% line:83% align:start
Being too relaxed can
also be a weakness.

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:09.304 position:30% line:83% align:start
And don't even
get me started on

00:30:09.338 --> 00:30:11.206 position:27% line:83% align:start
the issues with
your overconfidence.

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.142 position:21% line:83% align:start
No matter how strong
you are physically,

00:30:13.175 --> 00:30:16.245 position:10% line:83% align:start
if you let your focus waver,
you're set up to fail.

00:30:16.278 --> 00:30:18.579 position:16% line:83% align:start
[WHIS] I've noticed many
times where you're so sure

00:30:18.613 --> 00:30:20.848 position:13% line:83% align:start
of yourself, you let your
guard down in battle.

00:30:20.882 --> 00:30:23.751 position:7% line:89% align:start
Heh. He's got that one right.

00:30:23.785 --> 00:30:26.121 position:44% line:83% align:start
Well I still think
it was cheap shot.

00:30:26.155 --> 00:30:28.157 position:27% line:83% align:start
[BEERUS] What is
going on up here?

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:30.825 position:19% line:83% align:start
Some of us are trying
to sleep, you know!

00:30:30.858 --> 00:30:32.227 position:38% line:89% align:start
[yawns]

00:30:32.327 --> 00:30:33.961 position:35% line:89% align:start
[sneezes]

00:30:45.106 --> 00:30:46.607 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's one heck of a sneeze!

00:30:46.641 --> 00:30:47.975 position:19% line:83% align:start
If we got hit by that,
Whis would be

00:30:48.009 --> 00:30:50.344 position:21% line:83% align:start
scraping our bodies
off the ground.

00:30:50.378 --> 00:30:52.246 position:21% line:83% align:start
[WHIS] He gets like
this when he's sleepy.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.347 position:33% line:89% align:start
[GOKU] Huh?

00:30:53.381 --> 00:30:55.116 position:19% line:83% align:start
[WHIS] Could be worse.
He once plunged this planet

00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:56.350 position:30% line:83% align:start
into darkness
when he accidentally

00:30:56.384 --> 00:30:57.985 position:13% line:89% align:start
destroyed those two suns.

00:30:58.019 --> 00:30:59.053 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wait, if he
blew 'em up,

00:30:59.087 --> 00:31:00.754 position:5% line:83% align:start
then how are they
out there now?

00:31:00.787 --> 00:31:03.191 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you guys powerful
enough to make stars?

00:31:03.224 --> 00:31:06.094 position:33% line:83% align:start
Of course not. In rare
cases like that one,

00:31:06.127 --> 00:31:08.829 position:27% line:83% align:start
I simply perform
a temporal do-over.

00:31:08.862 --> 00:31:10.064 position:16% line:89% align:start
And what does that mean?

00:31:10.098 --> 00:31:12.799 position:7% line:83% align:start
[WHIS] I reverse time to right
before the incident happens,

00:31:12.833 --> 00:31:14.768 position:21% line:83% align:start
and then instead of
letting Beerus do it,

00:31:14.801 --> 00:31:17.204 position:24% line:83% align:start
I give him a quick
bop on the noggin.

00:31:17.238 --> 00:31:19.673 position:21% line:83% align:start
All right, what the
hell are you? Explain.

00:31:19.706 --> 00:31:21.041 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:31:21.074 --> 00:31:23.343 position:30% line:83% align:start
Now what's the
best way to explain this?

00:31:23.377 --> 00:31:26.279 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm simply the life form
that's known as Whis!

00:31:26.313 --> 00:31:29.082 position:7% line:83% align:start
[WHIS] At the moment, it's my
job to look after Lord Beerus.

00:31:29.116 --> 00:31:32.018 position:16% line:83% align:start
As you've no doubt seen,
he has some eccentric manners

00:31:32.052 --> 00:31:33.353 position:21% line:89% align:start
and a mighty temper.

00:31:33.386 --> 00:31:35.322 position:24% line:83% align:start
So I need certain
skills to cope with him.

00:31:35.355 --> 00:31:37.057 position:19% line:83% align:start
[GOKU] Sounds like the
old Destroyer can be...

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:39.092 position:7% line:83% align:start
[BEERUS] Hey! What are you two
punch-jockeys doing up here!

00:31:39.126 --> 00:31:41.261 position:24% line:83% align:start
Ee! Oh! Hi, Mister
Lord Beerus, sir.

00:31:41.294 --> 00:31:43.330 position:30% line:83% align:start
We asked your
servant Whis to train us.

00:31:43.363 --> 00:31:45.365 position:19% line:83% align:start
I figured that much--
I'm not a fool.

00:31:45.398 --> 00:31:47.833 position:24% line:83% align:start
What I mean is how
did you two get here?

00:31:47.867 --> 00:31:49.002 position:30% line:83% align:start
Don't be mad,
your lordness!

00:31:49.035 --> 00:31:50.170 position:27% line:83% align:start
We got in touch
with Mister Whis

00:31:50.203 --> 00:31:51.670 position:5% line:89% align:start
and asked him to bring us here!

00:31:51.704 --> 00:31:52.738 position:21% line:89% align:start
[WHIS clears throat]

00:31:52.771 --> 00:31:53.839 position:13% line:83% align:start
I can't sense your energy
to find this place so we

00:31:53.873 --> 00:31:56.909 position:7% line:83% align:start
had to hitch a ride with him!
It was the only way!

00:31:56.942 --> 00:31:59.812 position:13% line:83% align:start
[BEERUS] So, Whis brought
you here. Hah! Let me guess.

00:31:59.845 --> 00:32:01.381 position:30% line:83% align:start
All it took to
get on your good side

00:32:01.414 --> 00:32:03.782 position:5% line:89% align:start
was something high in calories.

00:32:03.816 --> 00:32:06.085 position:35% line:83% align:start
[chuckles]
Yup! You guessed it.

00:32:06.118 --> 00:32:09.054 position:7% line:83% align:start
And why is it so important to
build your strength, Goku?

00:32:09.088 --> 00:32:11.157 position:16% line:83% align:start
I hope all this training
isn't your secret way of

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:13.225 position:27% line:83% align:start
gunning for the
job of Destroyer.

00:32:13.259 --> 00:32:14.994 position:35% line:83% align:start
Oh, no I'd
never want your job!

00:32:15.027 --> 00:32:16.729 position:7% line:89% align:start
All I want is to get stronger!

00:32:16.762 --> 00:32:18.464 position:21% line:83% align:start
And I won't let this
clown leave me in the dust,

00:32:18.497 --> 00:32:19.999 position:21% line:89% align:start
so I'm training too.

00:32:20.032 --> 00:32:22.168 position:19% line:83% align:start
It hadn't dawned on me
'til now just how poorly

00:32:22.201 --> 00:32:23.369 position:21% line:89% align:start
you guys get along.

00:32:23.402 --> 00:32:26.071 position:7% line:83% align:start
[WHIS] If you ever found a way
to work together for once,

00:32:26.105 --> 00:32:27.705 position:24% line:83% align:start
you would be able
to go toe-to-toe

No. It's not fair!
Not Sasami too!

00:47:50.141 --> 00:47:52.976 position:13% line:83% align:start
You'd only seen recordings
of these monkeys in action.

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:55.045 position:19% line:83% align:start
Until you've felt the
heat of a Super Saiyan

00:47:55.079 --> 00:47:57.081 position:24% line:83% align:start
staring you down,
you can't possibly

00:47:57.114 --> 00:47:59.817 position:16% line:89% align:start
comprehend their power!

expect his son to transform.

[KRILLIN] Here.

--Here, want one?
--No thanks.

00:48:08.659 --> 00:48:11.361 position:19% line:83% align:start

finally ready to fight.

[GOHAN and KRILLIN gasp]

00:48:18.202 --> 00:48:21.071 position:7% line:83% align:start
Pathetic. Not that I couldn't
tell the moment I awoke,

00:48:21.105 --> 00:48:23.373 position:16% line:83% align:start
but the Frieza Force has
suffered quite the decline.

Eeh.

Please, forgive us.

They're a lot stronger...

00:48:28.979 --> 00:48:31.814 position:27% line:83% align:start
than we thought
they'd be, your lordship.

00:48:31.848 --> 00:48:33.350 position:33% line:83% align:start
Oh it makes
little difference.

00:48:33.383 --> 00:48:35.252 position:24% line:83% align:start
But the aesthetics
is another matter.

00:48:35.285 --> 00:48:37.053 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can't stand the sight
of all your anemic,

Jeez. Glad I
don't work for him.

Wow. They're just
as impressive as ever.

00:49:06.215 --> 00:49:08.851 position:13% line:83% align:start
But the real threat hasn't
even started fighting yet.

00:49:08.885 --> 00:49:10.752 position:30% line:83% align:start
The terror of
Frieza is so legendary,

00:49:10.785 --> 00:49:12.787 position:24% line:83% align:start
even the Galactic
Patrol is afraid of him.

Your friends could all
be dead meat, you know.

00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:16.292 position:27% line:83% align:start
Telling me that
is not helpful!

What are you doing here anyway?

00:49:17.493 --> 00:49:18.528 position:7% line:89% align:start
You should up there with them!

00:49:18.561 --> 00:49:20.829 position:13% line:83% align:start
The more fighters we have
the better our chances!

00:49:20.862 --> 00:49:22.864 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh don't be absurd.
I've already done more than

00:49:22.898 --> 00:49:25.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
enough in this fight.
My superiors would never

00:49:25.368 --> 00:49:27.903 position:19% line:83% align:start
expect me to challenge
the Evil Emperor himself!

00:49:27.936 --> 00:49:30.805 position:16% line:83% align:start
We have a strict policy
against suicide missions.

What do ya think, boys?

00:49:37.513 --> 00:49:40.715 position:5% line:83% align:start
If all five of us team up,
do we have a shot against him?

00:49:40.749 --> 00:49:42.484 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, but no.

00:49:42.517 --> 00:49:44.753 position:21% line:83% align:start

different class than we are,

00:49:44.786 --> 00:49:46.054 position:21% line:89% align:start
it's not even close.

00:49:46.087 --> 00:49:48.990 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah I was thinking the
same thing but I had to ask.

00:49:49.024 --> 00:49:51.426 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just wanted to make sure
I wasn't being a chicken.

00:49:51.459 --> 00:49:52.961 position:16% line:83% align:start
[FRIEZA] So the Earth's
valiant defenders

have to entertain myself

I remember when Goku's son
was just a little boy.

00:50:06.474 --> 00:50:09.977 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's so touching to see

have it! Not even a

Yeah. He's in real trouble.

00:50:31.832 --> 00:50:33.400 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think his heart
stopped beating.

time can it buy you?

Hey. How many more
of those Senzu Beans

00:50:56.256 --> 00:50:57.790 position:21% line:89% align:start
do we have, Krillin?

Uh! We've got
one more, that's it.

[BEERUS] Hey, Whis!

00:51:17.543 --> 00:51:19.245 position:7% line:89% align:start
[WHIS] You hollered, my lord?

00:51:19.279 --> 00:51:21.180 position:21% line:83% align:start
[BEERUS] What's this
stuff called again?

00:51:21.214 --> 00:51:23.449 position:21% line:83% align:start
The gooey, stretchy
substance on top?

00:51:23.483 --> 00:51:26.986 position:13% line:83% align:start
[WHIS] Let's see, what was
it called? Starts with a "C."

00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:28.254 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's cheese.

00:51:28.288 --> 00:51:29.988 position:13% line:89% align:start
Cheese! Cheese, that's it!

00:51:30.022 --> 00:51:31.391 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's a bit pungent
but I love it,

00:51:31.424 --> 00:51:33.159 position:5% line:89% align:start
especially when it's all melty!

00:51:33.192 --> 00:51:34.494 position:16% line:89% align:start
Aw come on, Lord Beerus.

00:51:34.527 --> 00:51:36.061 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you really have to
interrupt our training

00:51:36.094 --> 00:51:37.497 position:21% line:89% align:start
to talk about food?

00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:39.064 position:24% line:89% align:start
If I want to, yes.

00:51:39.097 --> 00:51:41.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
And I don't recommend
you take that sort of tone

00:51:41.066 --> 00:51:42.968 position:16% line:89% align:start
with a Destroyer again.

00:51:43.001 --> 00:51:45.103 position:19% line:83% align:start
[BEERUS] Don't forget,
your planet's culinary feats

00:51:45.137 --> 00:51:47.339 position:21% line:83% align:start
are the only reason
it continues to exist.

00:51:47.372 --> 00:51:49.241 position:24% line:83% align:start
But if you prefer,
I can destroy it now

00:51:49.274 --> 00:51:51.076 position:7% line:89% align:start
and you can practice in peace.

00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:53.412 position:27% line:83% align:start
[yells] No, no,
that's okay! I'm sorry.

00:51:53.445 --> 00:51:54.613 position:33% line:89% align:start
[BEERUS] Ha!

00:51:54.647 --> 00:51:57.482 position:30% line:89% align:start
[SEER humming]

00:51:57.516 --> 00:52:00.218 position:21% line:83% align:start

checking his messages!

00:52:00.252 --> 00:52:02.020 position:21% line:83% align:start
You got a call from
Earth a while ago,

00:52:02.054 --> 00:52:03.555 position:10% line:89% align:start
and I sense it's important!

00:52:03.588 --> 00:52:05.123 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh!

00:52:05.891 --> 00:52:09.027 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh yes, you're right.
It seems I did miss a call.

00:52:09.061 --> 00:52:11.330 position:16% line:83% align:start
I wonder if it's another
delectable food offering

00:52:11.363 --> 00:52:13.498 position:27% line:83% align:start
from Lady Bulma.
Wouldn't that be nice.

00:52:14.466 --> 00:52:16.635 position:24% line:83% align:start
[WHIS] Oh, it is!
And what's she call it?

00:52:16.668 --> 00:52:18.236 position:21% line:89% align:start
A strawberry sundae?

00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:21.205 position:13% line:83% align:start
I can only hope it tastes
as magnificent as it looks.

00:52:21.239 --> 00:52:23.308 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well the girl certainly
has piqued my interest.

00:52:23.342 --> 00:52:25.309 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll just check in
and find out more.

00:52:25.344 --> 00:52:26.944 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hurry, I want to know too!

00:52:26.977 --> 00:52:31.449 position:13% line:83% align:start
[WHIS] Hello, Lady Bulma?!
This strawberry sundae of yours,

00:52:31.483 --> 00:52:34.018 position:16% line:83% align:start
it wouldn't happen to be
a "sweet," would it?

00:52:34.051 --> 00:52:35.920 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh? Is that Whis?

00:52:35.953 --> 00:52:37.555 position:19% line:83% align:start
[BULMA] What the hell
took you so long?!

00:52:37.588 --> 00:52:39.123 position:13% line:89% align:start
I've been waiting forever!

00:52:39.156 --> 00:52:41.025 position:27% line:83% align:start
Vegeta and Goku
are there, right?

00:52:41.058 --> 00:52:42.493 position:30% line:83% align:start
Well tell 'em
to come home, now!

00:52:42.526 --> 00:52:44.495 position:16% line:83% align:start
And I don't want to hear
any crap about training!

00:52:44.528 --> 00:52:46.130 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's an emergency!

00:52:46.163 --> 00:52:48.232 position:16% line:83% align:start
That evil scumbag Frieza
has come back to life,

00:52:48.265 --> 00:52:49.934 position:13% line:89% align:start
and the Earth's in danger!

00:52:49.967 --> 00:52:50.900 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:52:50.935 --> 00:52:53.037 position:30% line:89% align:start

--[VEGETA] Say what?

00:52:54.572 --> 00:52:57.006 position:10% line:89% align:start
That can't be true. No way.

00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:58.309 position:19% line:89% align:start
After all these years?

00:52:58.342 --> 00:52:59.943 position:30% line:83% align:start
Just hold on!
We'll have Whis take us

00:52:59.976 --> 00:53:01.312 position:16% line:89% align:start
back as fast as he can!

00:53:01.345 --> 00:53:03.681 position:13% line:83% align:start
It takes about thirty-five
minutes at maximum speed.

00:53:03.714 --> 00:53:06.116 position:19% line:83% align:start
[BULMA] Are you nuts?
We can't wait that long!

00:53:06.149 --> 00:53:08.251 position:27% line:83% align:start
Use your Instant
Transmission, Goku!

00:53:08.284 --> 00:53:09.687 position:24% line:89% align:start
This isn't a joke!

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:12.322 position:16% line:83% align:start
Uh, I've gotta sense my
target for it to work, Bulma,

00:53:12.355 --> 00:53:14.357 position:19% line:83% align:start
and I'm not sure I can
from this far away.

00:53:14.391 --> 00:53:16.092 position:16% line:83% align:start
[BULMA] Frieza's energy
is huge, right?

00:53:16.126 --> 00:53:17.695 position:10% line:89% align:start
And the guys will help too!

00:53:17.728 --> 00:53:20.130 position:10% line:83% align:start
[BULMA] Hey, Goku's about to
use Instant Transmission

00:53:20.163 --> 00:53:22.232 position:21% line:83% align:start
and he needs a clear
signal to lock onto!

00:53:22.265 --> 00:53:24.134 position:13% line:89% align:start
Everybody power up to max!

00:53:24.167 --> 00:53:25.602 position:27% line:89% align:start
[ALL] Huh? Okay!

00:53:27.103 --> 00:53:28.638 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:34.077 position:30% line:83% align:start
Uh... What are
they doing, my lord?

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:37.946 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'd guess it's a distress
signal to their savior.

00:53:40.049 --> 00:53:42.452 position:33% line:83% align:start
I've got it!
Here, Vegeta, let's go!

00:53:42.485 --> 00:53:44.354 position:30% line:83% align:start
What? Please.
You're actually asking me

00:53:44.387 --> 00:53:45.288 position:24% line:89% align:start
to hold your hand?

00:53:45.321 --> 00:53:47.490 position:24% line:83% align:start
Just do it, okay!
You know how Bulma gets!

00:53:47.524 --> 00:53:49.091 position:19% line:83% align:start
We've gotta get there
before she says something

00:53:49.124 --> 00:53:50.393 position:21% line:89% align:start
to piss off Frieza!

00:53:50.427 --> 00:53:53.262 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:53:53.696 --> 00:53:55.598 position:24% line:89% align:start
Next stop, Earth!

00:54:00.737 --> 00:54:01.704 position:30% line:89% align:start
[VEGETA] Ugh!

00:54:01.738 --> 00:54:03.405 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:54:03.439 --> 00:54:04.273 position:33% line:89% align:start
[GOHAN] Dad!

00:54:04.306 --> 00:54:05.307 position:27% line:89% align:start
[KRILLIN laughs]

00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:06.709 position:16% line:89% align:start
Did we make it in time?

00:54:06.743 --> 00:54:09.678 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KRILLIN] Yeah. I mean
it was close, but sure.

00:54:09.711 --> 00:54:11.413 position:24% line:83% align:start
You know just once
it might be nice for you

00:54:11.447 --> 00:54:13.615 position:30% line:83% align:start
to show up at
the start of the fight.

00:54:13.649 --> 00:54:16.185 position:19% line:89% align:start
[laughs] Yeah, sorry.

00:54:16.218 --> 00:54:18.120 position:24% line:83% align:start
The guest of honor
is here at last.

00:54:18.153 --> 00:54:20.489 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've been waiting such
a long time for you.

00:54:20.522 --> 00:54:22.057 position:35% line:89% align:start
[GOKU] Hm.

00:54:24.293 --> 00:54:25.260 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm!

00:54:25.294 --> 00:54:27.429 position:16% line:83% align:start
[FRIEZA] I didn't think
I'd see Vegeta here too,

00:54:27.463 --> 00:54:30.232 position:5% line:89% align:start
but monkeys do travel in troops.

00:54:30.265 --> 00:54:31.433 position:27% line:83% align:start
All that really
matters to me is

00:54:31.467 --> 00:54:33.402 position:7% line:89% align:start
I finally get to destroy you.

00:54:33.435 --> 00:54:35.504 position:19% line:83% align:start
I thought we were done
with you for good, Frieza.

00:54:35.537 --> 00:54:37.406 position:7% line:89% align:start
How did you come back to life?

00:54:37.439 --> 00:54:39.641 position:21% line:83% align:start
His lackeys used the
Earth's Dragon Balls.

00:54:39.675 --> 00:54:42.711 position:10% line:83% align:start
It was about six months ago.
Isn't that right?

00:54:42.744 --> 00:54:44.580 position:30% line:83% align:start
It was poetic,
using Earth's dragon

00:54:44.613 --> 00:54:46.314 position:7% line:89% align:start
to save me from Earth's Hell.

00:54:46.347 --> 00:54:49.517 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, you can't imagine the
depths of my suffering there.

00:54:49.550 --> 00:54:51.085 position:27% line:83% align:start
[FRIEZA] I spent
most of my days strung up

00:54:51.118 --> 00:54:52.487 position:13% line:89% align:start
like a damn pupating moth,

00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:54.589 position:16% line:83% align:start
trapped over a field of
delicate little flowers

00:54:54.622 --> 00:54:56.324 position:21% line:83% align:start
[FRIEZA] where bands
of angels and fairies

00:54:56.357 --> 00:54:58.292 position:30% line:83% align:start
and enchanted
stuffed animals lived!

00:54:58.326 --> 00:55:00.328 position:24% line:83% align:start
They played songs
and danced asinine jigs

00:55:00.361 --> 00:55:01.696 position:7% line:89% align:start
as if their only care in life

00:55:01.729 --> 00:55:04.732 position:16% line:83% align:start
was when they would get
their next warm, fuzzy hug!

00:55:04.765 --> 00:55:07.235 position:19% line:83% align:start
Instead of ruling the
Universe with an iron fist,

00:55:07.268 --> 00:55:09.670 position:5% line:89% align:start
I was serenaded by teddy bears!

00:55:10.538 --> 00:55:12.573 position:19% line:83% align:start
[GOKU] Well don't try
to put that on me, Frieza.

00:55:12.607 --> 00:55:14.642 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're the one who came
to Earth looking for a fight.

00:55:14.675 --> 00:55:16.811 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's the only reason
Trunks took your life.

00:55:16.844 --> 00:55:19.514 position:10% line:83% align:start
[FRIEZA] I had to come here,
that's what you don't get.

00:55:19.547 --> 00:55:21.782 position:13% line:83% align:start
Because I'll never be able
to sleep in this Cosmos

00:55:21.816 --> 00:55:23.784 position:33% line:83% align:start
knowing that
I share it with you!

00:55:24.785 --> 00:55:27.220 position:13% line:83% align:start
[FRIEZA] Your death is my
remedy. That's why I've been

00:55:27.254 --> 00:55:29.590 position:21% line:83% align:start
training intensively
every day since my return;

00:55:29.624 --> 00:55:32.325 position:21% line:83% align:start
to make sure I won't
lose to you again.

00:55:32.359 --> 00:55:34.160 position:21% line:83% align:start
Having to put a real
effort into anything

00:55:34.194 --> 00:55:35.830 position:13% line:89% align:start
was a first for me, Goku.

00:55:35.863 --> 00:55:38.465 position:16% line:83% align:start
[FRIEZA] I'll make sure
you suffer for that, too.

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:45.171 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're a lot stronger
now than the last time

00:55:45.205 --> 00:55:47.674 position:21% line:83% align:start
I saw you, Frieza--
there's no question about that.

00:55:47.707 --> 00:55:48.875 position:30% line:83% align:start
But it's been
a really long time,

00:55:48.909 --> 00:55:51.711 position:7% line:83% align:start
and in case you didn't notice,
I've gotten stronger, too.

00:55:51.745 --> 00:55:53.513 position:24% line:83% align:start
The first time we
fought I made mistakes

00:55:53.547 --> 00:55:55.080 position:10% line:89% align:start
and you caught me off guard.

00:55:55.114 --> 00:55:56.683 position:21% line:83% align:start
To ensure that won't
happen I'm going to

00:55:56.716 --> 00:55:59.084 position:24% line:83% align:start
take my final form
from the start.

training did he do?

00:56:44.228 --> 00:56:46.197 position:24% line:83% align:start
Guys. This is way
worse than I thought.

you're no pushover,

00:56:52.337 --> 00:56:53.404 position:27% line:89% align:start
that's for sure.

00:56:53.438 --> 00:56:54.840 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you weren't rotten
to the core, you'd actually

00:56:54.873 --> 00:56:57.241 position:30% line:83% align:start
make a perfect
sparring partner for me.

00:56:57.275 --> 00:56:58.677 position:16% line:89% align:start
What a waste of talent.

00:56:58.711 --> 00:57:00.545 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's just the sort of
small-minded drivel

00:57:00.578 --> 00:57:03.147 position:27% line:83% align:start
that makes your
existence so intolerable.

Go on. Channel that Super
Saiyan glow I hate so much.

00:57:16.227 --> 00:57:19.764 position:19% line:83% align:start
To be honest, Frieza,
I'm not so sure I need to yet.

00:57:19.797 --> 00:57:21.232 position:13% line:89% align:start
[FRIEZA] Well, well, well.

even bigger britches now.

Frieza's more

You're obviously joking.

him just a little longer,

Well this is unexpected.

01:01:28.908 --> 01:01:31.576 position:10% line:83% align:start
I knew a great deal of time
had passed since our battle.

01:01:31.610 --> 01:01:33.545 position:21% line:83% align:start
And I knew you were
the self-improvement type,

01:01:33.578 --> 01:01:36.414 position:24% line:83% align:start
but you've climbed
higher than I thought.

01:01:36.448 --> 01:01:38.450 position:35% line:83% align:start
I tried to
warn you, Frieza.

01:01:38.483 --> 01:01:40.485 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's fortunate
I trained so hard,

01:01:40.518 --> 01:01:42.721 position:7% line:89% align:start
or I might actually be scared.

01:01:42.754 --> 01:01:44.723 position:19% line:89% align:start
[chuckles] I knew it.

01:01:44.756 --> 01:01:47.025 position:21% line:83% align:start
You've been holding
something back, haven't you?

01:01:47.058 --> 01:01:48.994 position:21% line:83% align:start
[FRIEZA] That's well
deduced for a simpleton.

01:01:49.027 --> 01:01:51.129 position:7% line:89% align:start
I've held back just like you.

[FRIEZA] So what is this,

[chuckles]

01:02:55.059 --> 01:02:57.493 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's a little more
complicated than that.

You don't have the patience
for the full story...

01:02:59.762 --> 01:03:01.698 position:21% line:83% align:start
so let's say I got a
taste of something called

01:03:01.731 --> 01:03:03.599 position:24% line:83% align:start
Super Saiyan God,
and now I've learned to

01:03:03.633 --> 01:03:05.835 position:7% line:89% align:start
tap into that power on my own.

01:03:05.868 --> 01:03:07.804 position:19% line:89% align:start
Not bad at all, Goku.

01:03:08.571 --> 01:03:10.540 position:33% line:83% align:start
This is just
further vindication.

01:03:10.573 --> 01:03:12.675 position:21% line:83% align:start
If I hadn't evolved
to a new level myself,

01:03:12.709 --> 01:03:15.645 position:10% line:83% align:start
then this might have proven
rather perilous for me.

you stop talking

01:04:14.369 --> 01:04:17.339 position:10% line:83% align:start
you grasped my new position
atop the pecking order.

this iteration

than a shimmering new façade.

01:04:27.782 --> 01:04:29.817 position:16% line:83% align:start
I noticed. To be honest,
you're more powerful

01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:31.719 position:21% line:83% align:start
than I was expecting
as well, Frieza,

01:04:31.752 --> 01:04:34.755 position:5% line:83% align:start

01:08:47.536 --> 01:08:48.937 position:35% line:89% align:start
[WHIS] Ah!

01:08:48.971 --> 01:08:50.973 position:16% line:83% align:start
[BEERUS] Look at Vegeta,
just watching.

01:08:51.006 --> 01:08:53.509 position:19% line:83% align:start
The Saiyans would win
if they fought as one.

01:08:53.542 --> 01:08:56.345 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yes, if they worked together
they'd clearly be unstoppable,

01:08:56.378 --> 01:08:58.314 position:27% line:83% align:start
but they're far
too proud to do that.

01:08:58.347 --> 01:08:59.847 position:21% line:89% align:start
You mean too stupid.

01:08:59.881 --> 01:09:00.882 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

01:09:00.915 --> 01:09:02.284 position:21% line:89% align:start
You said it, not me.

[FRIEZA grunts]

[GOKU breathes heavily]

01:09:11.059 --> 01:09:12.360 position:30% line:89% align:start
[FRIEZA] Hmm.

01:09:12.393 --> 01:09:16.230 position:24% line:89% align:start
[breathes heavily]

01:09:16.264 --> 01:09:19.867 position:13% line:83% align:start
Damn it. Hate to admit it,
but I'm having some trouble.

01:09:19.901 --> 01:09:21.869 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

01:09:21.903 --> 01:09:24.205 position:24% line:83% align:start
You say that like
it isn't obvious.

01:09:24.238 --> 01:09:27.108 position:16% line:89% align:start
[GOKU breathes heavily]

01:09:27.141 --> 01:09:28.409 position:30% line:83% align:start
There's no way
around it, Frieza,

01:09:28.443 --> 01:09:29.610 position:13% line:89% align:start
you really are impressive.

01:09:29.644 --> 01:09:32.280 position:13% line:83% align:start
It took me years of blood
and sweat to reach this level,

01:09:32.313 --> 01:09:34.048 position:24% line:83% align:start
but you've caught
up like it's nothing.

01:09:34.082 --> 01:09:35.283 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

01:09:35.316 --> 01:09:37.352 position:16% line:83% align:start
Surely you're not trying
to play on my mercy.

01:09:37.385 --> 01:09:39.387 position:30% line:83% align:start
Not even Goku
could be that naïve.

01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:41.988 position:24% line:83% align:start
I commend you for
putting up a good struggle.

01:09:42.022 --> 01:09:44.091 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I won't stop until
I've had my revenge

01:09:44.124 --> 01:09:46.627 position:24% line:83% align:start
and you're in far
too many pieces to count!

01:09:47.662 --> 01:09:49.630 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yes. You're so close!

01:09:49.664 --> 01:09:50.931 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

01:09:50.964 --> 01:09:52.299 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh...!

01:09:54.234 --> 01:09:56.269 position:30% line:89% align:start
What? Beerus?

01:09:56.303 --> 01:09:59.206 position:13% line:83% align:start
That not's polite, Frieza,
you forgot to say "Lord."

01:09:59.239 --> 01:10:01.208 position:19% line:83% align:start
[FRIEZA] Lord Beerus,
that's what I meant!

01:10:01.241 --> 01:10:03.110 position:24% line:83% align:start
But, uh, what are
you doing here?

01:10:03.143 --> 01:10:05.078 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well I would have
thought that was obvious.

01:10:05.112 --> 01:10:07.514 position:16% line:83% align:start
I stopped by to eat this
fantastic sundae.

01:10:07.547 --> 01:10:10.150 position:19% line:83% align:start
But--But Lord Beerus,
I came here for vengeance,

01:10:10.183 --> 01:10:12.085 position:7% line:89% align:start
are you planning to intervene?

01:10:12.119 --> 01:10:14.688 position:16% line:83% align:start
[scoffs] Now why would I
possibly care about that?

01:10:14.721 --> 01:10:17.057 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're free to do
as you please, Frieza.

01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:19.426 position:19% line:83% align:start
But just do it farther
away from my ice cream.

01:10:19.459 --> 01:10:22.928 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't want to confuse your
combat dust for sprinkles.

01:10:22.962 --> 01:10:25.399 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then you seriously
didn't come to stop me?

01:10:25.432 --> 01:10:27.501 position:27% line:83% align:start
I just told you
to do as you please.

01:10:27.534 --> 01:10:31.070 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm a Destroyer god.
I'm not here to take sides.

01:10:31.103 --> 01:10:33.607 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hold on! You mean you'd
really let Frieza win?

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:35.575 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's not my fight, is it now?

01:10:35.609 --> 01:10:36.610 position:5% line:89% align:start
What're you talking about?

01:10:36.643 --> 01:10:39.278 position:5% line:83% align:start
If Frieza wins,
he'll kill us all!

01:10:40.112 --> 01:10:41.347 position:24% line:89% align:start
Calm down, Bulma.

01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:44.083 position:5% line:83% align:start
As long as you keep supplying me
with fine delicacies like this,

01:10:44.116 --> 01:10:46.252 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll make sure that your
life is spared, at least.

01:10:46.285 --> 01:10:48.487 position:13% line:89% align:start
You just stay close to me.

01:10:48.521 --> 01:10:50.256 position:19% line:83% align:start
[PICCOLO, TIEN, ROSHI,
KRILLIN, and GOHAN chuckle]

01:10:51.090 --> 01:10:54.160 position:16% line:83% align:start
Bulma. Is that actually
Lord Beerus the Destroyer?

01:10:54.193 --> 01:10:55.327 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I told you!

01:10:55.361 --> 01:10:56.695 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do you think you can
get a quick picture

01:10:56.729 --> 01:10:57.763 position:24% line:89% align:start
of me next to him?

01:10:57.797 --> 01:11:00.299 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're more than welcome
to ask him yourself, Jaco.

01:11:00.332 --> 01:11:03.502 position:19% line:83% align:start
But don't blame me if
the guy disintegrates you.

01:11:03.536 --> 01:11:05.137 position:27% line:89% align:start
Uh, never mind.

01:11:06.037 --> 01:11:08.707 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, then. Want to pick
which limb I take first

01:11:08.741 --> 01:11:10.543 position:16% line:89% align:start
or shall I surprise you?

01:11:10.576 --> 01:11:12.411 position:27% line:83% align:start
[GOKU] You sure
you want to keep going?

01:11:12.445 --> 01:11:16.181 position:7% line:83% align:start
You're better off leaving on a
high note, while you still can.

01:11:16.214 --> 01:11:19.184 position:10% line:83% align:start
You just got a new life, and
I'd hate for you to waste it.

01:11:19.217 --> 01:11:22.253 position:10% line:83% align:start
You can't think I'd retreat
with victory so close at hand.

01:11:22.287 --> 01:11:24.255 position:24% line:83% align:start
What sort of fool
do you think I am?

01:11:24.289 --> 01:11:27.125 position:10% line:83% align:start
[VEGETA] Kakarot, I'll take
my turn now, if you want.

01:11:27.158 --> 01:11:29.160 position:21% line:83% align:start
[GOKU] Aw, come on!
That's not fair!

01:11:29.194 --> 01:11:30.663 position:19% line:83% align:start
The only reason you're
volunteering now is 'cause

01:11:30.696 --> 01:11:32.430 position:13% line:89% align:start
you see his weakness too!

01:11:32.464 --> 01:11:34.432 position:27% line:89% align:start
See my weakness?

01:11:34.466 --> 01:11:37.502 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

01:11:37.535 --> 01:11:40.038 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is truly becoming a farce!

01:11:40.071 --> 01:11:41.539 position:24% line:83% align:start
I hurl you through
cliff sides and you want to

01:11:41.573 --> 01:11:43.641 position:16% line:89% align:start
talk about my weakness?

01:11:43.675 --> 01:11:45.009 position:19% line:89% align:start
Fine, I'll play along.

01:11:45.043 --> 01:11:47.345 position:7% line:89% align:start
What is my fatal shortcoming?

01:11:47.378 --> 01:11:48.513 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

01:11:48.546 --> 01:11:52.082 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's not affecting you yet,
Frieza, but it's about to.

01:11:52.116 --> 01:11:53.351 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm?

01:11:53.384 --> 01:11:56.119 position:7% line:83% align:start
[VEGETA] You're too eager for
revenge, that's why you'll fail.

01:11:56.153 --> 01:11:58.121 position:24% line:83% align:start
Let me take a wild
guess about your training.

01:11:58.155 --> 01:12:00.224 position:21% line:83% align:start
You bolted to Earth
the moment you achieved this

01:12:00.257 --> 01:12:02.259 position:27% line:83% align:start
new golden form
of yours, didn't you?

01:12:02.292 --> 01:12:04.462 position:19% line:83% align:start
And so what if I did?
What's your point?

01:12:04.496 --> 01:12:06.330 position:16% line:83% align:start
[GOKU] Your new form is
burning through more power

01:12:06.363 --> 01:12:08.365 position:13% line:89% align:start
than your body can supply.

01:12:08.398 --> 01:12:09.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
You should've waited
until you were used to

01:12:09.801 --> 01:12:11.368 position:30% line:83% align:start
this form and
knew how to regulate it

01:12:11.401 --> 01:12:13.671 position:24% line:83% align:start
before you started
picking fights.

01:12:13.705 --> 01:12:17.241 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hm! Is that what you cling to?
Well in that case...

01:12:17.274 --> 01:12:20.277 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'll just stop wasting my time
and kill you right now!

I'll send it back.

Oh yeah!

[breathes heavily]

[panting]

01:16:16.308 --> 01:16:18.877 position:27% line:83% align:start
See? I told you
you'd run out of gas.

01:16:18.910 --> 01:16:21.513 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now take my advice
and get out of here.

01:16:21.546 --> 01:16:23.648 position:7% line:89% align:start
And live to fight another day.

01:16:23.682 --> 01:16:25.550 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

01:16:25.584 --> 01:16:28.553 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll be here for a rematch
when you're ready, I promise.

01:16:28.587 --> 01:16:33.324 position:24% line:89% align:start
[grunts] Damn you!

01:16:33.357 --> 01:16:37.896 position:35% line:89% align:start
Why? Why?

01:16:37.929 --> 01:16:39.697 position:10% line:89% align:start
This shouldn't be happening!

01:16:39.731 --> 01:16:44.535 position:24% line:89% align:start
I am Lord Frieza!

01:16:50.008 --> 01:16:52.043 position:38% line:89% align:start

[snarls]

01:17:06.056 --> 01:17:07.525 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

[BOTH sigh]

01:17:27.111 --> 01:17:29.412 position:24% line:83% align:start
[FRIEZA] Exemplary
marksmanship, Sorbet.

01:17:29.445 --> 01:17:31.881 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SORBET] Uh! Thank you,
I live to serve!

01:17:31.916 --> 01:17:33.984 position:27% line:89% align:start
[groans, snarls]

01:17:34.018 --> 01:17:36.419 position:13% line:83% align:start
Good thing for contingency
plans, right Goku?

01:17:36.452 --> 01:17:38.088 position:21% line:83% align:start
As if I'd allow even
the slightest chance

01:17:38.122 --> 01:17:40.590 position:16% line:89% align:start
of losing to you again!

01:17:40.623 --> 01:17:44.861 position:30% line:89% align:start

[FRIEZA] Hmmm...

01:17:52.068 --> 01:17:53.736 position:38% line:89% align:start
[yells]

01:17:53.770 --> 01:17:57.106 position:27% line:83% align:start
[FRIEZA grunts]
[GOKU groans]

01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:59.108 position:41% line:89% align:start
Goku!

01:17:59.142 --> 01:18:02.111 position:13% line:83% align:start
[FRIEZA breathes heavily]
[GOKU groans]

01:18:05.782 --> 01:18:09.152 position:13% line:83% align:start
Wake up. Torture's no fun
if I can't hear you scream.

01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:10.119 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

[ALL gasp]

01:18:18.094 --> 01:18:21.029 position:19% line:83% align:start
You know, I did try to
warn Goku this might happen.

01:18:21.064 --> 01:18:23.765 position:21% line:83% align:start
Clearly a dirty move
by Frieza, but effective.

01:18:23.799 --> 01:18:25.168 position:13% line:89% align:start
You have to give him that.

01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:27.436 position:33% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

01:18:27.469 --> 01:18:30.138 position:24% line:83% align:start

[laughs]

01:18:53.761 --> 01:18:55.563 position:30% line:83% align:start
Your obsession
with showing me leniency

01:18:55.596 --> 01:18:57.099 position:10% line:89% align:start
borders on the pathological!

01:18:57.132 --> 01:18:58.766 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're too strong
for your own good,

01:18:58.799 --> 01:19:00.168 position:10% line:89% align:start
it's made you overconfident!

01:19:00.202 --> 01:19:02.536 position:21% line:83% align:start
A fearless fool who
insists on second chances

01:19:02.570 --> 01:19:04.605 position:30% line:83% align:start
and habitually
lowers his guard.

01:19:04.639 --> 01:19:07.142 position:7% line:83% align:start
[FRIEZA] "Here lies one of the
strongest mortals in the Cosmos,

01:19:07.175 --> 01:19:09.177 position:10% line:89% align:start
felled by a common ray gun!"

01:19:09.211 --> 01:19:10.978 position:10% line:89% align:start
How pitiful does that feel?

01:19:11.012 --> 01:19:12.546 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:15.082 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now you're the one on
the ground facing defeat.

01:19:15.116 --> 01:19:17.585 position:24% line:83% align:start
You won the battle
but then you lost the war.

01:19:17.618 --> 01:19:19.887 position:16% line:83% align:start
And the dream I clung to
in that damned cocoon

01:19:19.921 --> 01:19:22.123 position:21% line:89% align:start
is finally at hand!

01:19:22.156 --> 01:19:23.791 position:24% line:89% align:start
[FRIEZA chuckles]

01:19:23.824 --> 01:19:25.526 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now to pick the
fruit of my labor--

01:19:25.559 --> 01:19:27.094 position:13% line:89% align:start
the fruit called revenge!

01:19:27.128 --> 01:19:30.530 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

01:19:30.563 --> 01:19:32.499 position:27% line:83% align:start
Ooh, now there's
an interesting thought.

01:19:32.532 --> 01:19:35.803 position:13% line:83% align:start
We could make this moment
so much more delectable!

01:19:35.836 --> 01:19:39.539 position:21% line:83% align:start
[FRIEZA] Oh, Vegeta,
come down here for a second!

01:19:39.572 --> 01:19:41.474 position:10% line:89% align:start
Wouldn't you like to do it?

01:19:41.508 --> 01:19:43.510 position:24% line:83% align:start
I know you despise
this Saiyan underling

01:19:43.543 --> 01:19:45.146 position:10% line:89% align:start
for daring to be so uppity.

01:19:45.179 --> 01:19:47.048 position:16% line:83% align:start
So I'll let you kill him
to prove you've realized

01:19:47.081 --> 01:19:50.550 position:7% line:83% align:start
your folly and re-pledge your
loyalty, like the old days.

01:19:50.583 --> 01:19:52.953 position:24% line:83% align:start
[FRIEZA] Do it and
I'll spare you, at least.

01:19:52.986 --> 01:19:55.222 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

01:20:00.593 --> 01:20:01.795 position:33% line:89% align:start
Vegeta, no!

01:20:01.828 --> 01:20:03.964 position:16% line:89% align:start
Shut your mouth, woman!

01:20:03.997 --> 01:20:06.766 position:16% line:89% align:start
[GOKU breathes heavily]

01:20:07.901 --> 01:20:10.637 position:30% line:83% align:start
Hey. I really
botched this one, huh?

01:20:10.670 --> 01:20:12.005 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:15.809 position:19% line:83% align:start
Whis tried to warn you
and yet here you are.

01:20:15.842 --> 01:20:18.912 position:24% line:83% align:start
I guess you always
will be a naïve idiot.

01:20:18.945 --> 01:20:20.713 position:19% line:83% align:start
Thanks for the offer,
but I can't.

01:20:20.746 --> 01:20:22.182 position:30% line:83% align:start
As annoying as
this bastard can be,

01:20:22.215 --> 01:20:24.985 position:10% line:83% align:start
it's our rivalry that keeps
pushing me to get stronger.

01:20:25.018 --> 01:20:26.953 position:10% line:89% align:start
I can't afford to kill him.

01:20:26.987 --> 01:20:29.922 position:35% line:83% align:start
[chuckles]
What if I sweeten the deal?

01:20:29.955 --> 01:20:31.657 position:27% line:83% align:start
Take Goku's life
and I'll appoint you

01:20:31.690 --> 01:20:34.127 position:19% line:83% align:start
the Supreme Commander
of the entire Frieza Force.

01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:36.929 position:7% line:83% align:start
Of course I know at the moment
it only consists of Sorbet,

01:20:36.962 --> 01:20:39.665 position:21% line:83% align:start
but we'll rebuild it
stronger than ever!

01:20:39.698 --> 01:20:41.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
You would make me
your Supreme Commander?

01:20:41.867 --> 01:20:43.235 position:19% line:89% align:start
Is that a real offer?

01:20:43.268 --> 01:20:46.739 position:24% line:83% align:start
[laughs] Should I
take that as a "yes"?

01:20:46.772 --> 01:20:50.242 position:24% line:83% align:start
Damn it. Now I may
actually regret this...

01:20:50.275 --> 01:20:52.177 position:38% line:89% align:start
Huh...?

01:20:52.211 --> 01:20:54.279 position:27% line:83% align:start
But I've already
made my decision.

01:20:54.313 --> 01:20:57.649 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm going to pulverize you
until there's nothing left.

01:20:57.683 --> 01:20:59.885 position:10% line:89% align:start
Ah! You dare say that to me?

01:20:59.918 --> 01:21:02.021 position:19% line:83% align:start
Use your head. Do you
actually think I would

01:21:02.054 --> 01:21:04.256 position:24% line:83% align:start
stay loyal to you
after you blew up the planet

01:21:04.289 --> 01:21:05.924 position:16% line:89% align:start
I was destined to rule?

01:21:05.958 --> 01:21:07.558 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

01:21:07.592 --> 01:21:09.161 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, I wonder what the
prince would do if he knew

01:21:09.194 --> 01:21:12.231 position:7% line:83% align:start
you authorized Planet Vegeta's
destruction from the start?

01:21:12.264 --> 01:21:14.599 position:10% line:89% align:start
Shh! Keep that under wraps!

01:21:14.632 --> 01:21:15.867 position:16% line:89% align:start
Get down here, Krillin.

01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:17.969 position:24% line:83% align:start
Your buddy Kakarot
needs a Senzu Bean.

01:21:18.002 --> 01:21:19.771 position:24% line:89% align:start
He's fading fast.

01:21:19.804 --> 01:21:22.006 position:24% line:89% align:start
Okay, I'm coming!

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:24.142 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, I don't think so!

01:21:28.079 --> 01:21:29.213 position:33% line:89% align:start
What the--?!

01:21:29.247 --> 01:21:30.982 position:24% line:89% align:start

He's wasn't kidding.
You're in bad shape.

01:21:45.662 --> 01:21:48.032 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KRILLIN] Good thing that
space cop didn't want his.

[FRIEZA gasps]

01:21:51.235 --> 01:21:52.136 position:33% line:89% align:start
[GOKU] Ah...

01:21:52.170 --> 01:21:55.639 position:27% line:83% align:start
Thanks, Vegeta.
You really saved my neck!

01:21:55.672 --> 01:21:58.076 position:16% line:83% align:start
Ha! You can thank me by
staying out of this fight

01:21:58.109 --> 01:22:00.244 position:33% line:83% align:start
from now on.
I'm finishing this!

01:22:00.278 --> 01:22:03.747 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah, of course! It's your
turn anyway. Have fun!

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:11.389 position:19% line:83% align:start
Please. If you believe
you can defeat me,

01:22:11.422 --> 01:22:13.757 position:27% line:83% align:start
then you're more
delusional than ever!

That's right.
You had no idea, did you?

01:22:41.451 --> 01:22:45.087 position:13% line:83% align:start
[VEGETA] I've been a Super
Saiyan for years, and now...

01:22:45.122 --> 01:22:47.957 position:7% line:89% align:start
I too have the power of a god.

[FRIEZA] Uh!

01:23:05.241 --> 01:23:07.443 position:24% line:83% align:start

He couldn't just die. He took
the whole planet with him.

You're wrong.

surviving in a vacuum.

Tactically speaking, that was
a pretty ingenious move.

01:25:48.166 --> 01:25:51.002 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's not fair.
He took everything!

01:25:51.036 --> 01:25:53.004 position:27% line:83% align:start
The Dragon Balls
were destroyed as well,

01:25:53.038 --> 01:25:54.607 position:27% line:83% align:start
so we can't even
summon Shenron.

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:57.576 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's no way we can
reverse what Frieza's done.

01:25:57.610 --> 01:25:59.612 position:16% line:89% align:start
[GOKU] This is my fault.

01:25:59.645 --> 01:26:01.413 position:27% line:83% align:start
Damn! Frieza was
right about me!

01:26:01.446 --> 01:26:04.049 position:13% line:83% align:start
I should have finished him
off when I had the chance!

01:26:04.082 --> 01:26:06.985 position:21% line:83% align:start
Agreed. Then are you
ready to make this right?

01:26:07.018 --> 01:26:08.086 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:26:08.119 --> 01:26:09.487 position:30% line:83% align:start
You failed to
protect your planet

01:26:09.521 --> 01:26:11.156 position:7% line:89% align:start
because of your own leniency.

01:26:11.189 --> 01:26:12.624 position:27% line:83% align:start
The only way to
avoid this outcome

01:26:12.657 --> 01:26:15.393 position:19% line:83% align:start
is to send Frieza back
to his flower garden.
