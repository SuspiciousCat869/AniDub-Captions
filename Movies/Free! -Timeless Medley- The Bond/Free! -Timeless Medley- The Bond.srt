1
00:00:51,775 --> 00:00:53,983
[IKUYA] Why didn't you
say anything to me?

2
00:01:34,067 --> 00:01:35,900
[HARUKA]
It's the same.

3
00:01:39,817 --> 00:01:41,483
Because I, uh...

4
00:01:43,942 --> 00:01:50,358
[alarm beeping]

5
00:01:50,442 --> 00:01:54,275
[HARUKA] Weird. Why'd I
dream about back then?

6
00:01:54,358 --> 00:01:56,400
[doorbell rings]

7
00:02:00,442 --> 00:02:01,900
[MAKOTO]
Good morning, Haru.

8
00:02:01,983 --> 00:02:03,358
Yeah. Morning.

9
00:02:03,442 --> 00:02:05,442
Well, are you ready to head out?

10
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:08,858
[MAKOTO panting]
After that,

11
00:02:08,942 --> 00:02:10,983
Nagisa just kept on
eating even more.

12
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:12,608
[HARUKA]
Sounds exactly like him.

13
00:02:12,692 --> 00:02:16,067
[MAKOTO] Yeah, but then after
that, he got a personal best.

14
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,275
[HARUKA]
Yeah.

15
00:02:17,358 --> 00:02:19,067
Whats wrong? You cold?

16
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,483
The wind is cold.

17
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:22,817
I guess it is a
little chilly, huh?

18
00:02:25,317 --> 00:02:27,983
[HARUKA]
Even though it's already spring.

19
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:30,692
Yeah. It's like there's only
a hint of spring in the air.

20
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,317
This time of year always
reminds me of stuff, you know?

21
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,483
I can't help it.

22
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:38,650
Like, do you remember
the first day we met?

23
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:54,358
[BOY A]
Whoa, a dump truck!

24
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:55,692
Really? Oh!

25
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,400
[BOY A]
Whoa, it's so huge!

26
00:02:57,483 --> 00:02:58,983
Wait for me!

27
00:03:07,983 --> 00:03:09,775
Are you all right?

28
00:04:54,275 --> 00:04:56,358
[MAKOTO] Truth is, I've
always felt pretty lucky

29
00:04:56,442 --> 00:04:58,108
to have met you that day.

30
00:04:58,192 --> 00:05:01,108
You're a really
great friend, Haruka.

31
00:05:01,192 --> 00:05:03,317
We've agreed not to call
me that, haven't we?

32
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,067
[NAGISA]
Haru! Mako!

33
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,150
[MAKOTO]
Hey, Nagisa! Hey, Rei!

34
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:09,983
[chuckles]

35
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:11,442
You guys are early.

36
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:13,567
[REI] Well, spring break
is almost over.

37
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,358
I can't stop imagining
school in April

38
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:17,608
and getting to
demonstrate the new me.

39
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,233
Who could ever sleep in
when there's this much

40
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:20,900
showing off to anticipate?

41
00:05:20,983 --> 00:05:23,358
Good point. Wow, Rei,
you're fired up.

42
00:05:23,442 --> 00:05:25,567
I for one, am just excited
about all the stamina

43
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,400
I'm building on these long runs!

44
00:05:27,483 --> 00:05:30,150
[chuckles] Wow, you two
are so dependable.

45
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:31,400
Thanks!

46
00:05:31,483 --> 00:05:32,775
All I want in the whole
world is the four of us

47
00:05:32,858 --> 00:05:35,775
to get as far as we
can this coming year.

48
00:05:35,858 --> 00:05:37,650
So, which way should we go?

49
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,650
Do we get to take
the usual route?

50
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:42,025
Sure thing. I'm
ready if you are.

51
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,942
[NAGISA] In that case,
good luck catching up,

52
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:45,400
'cause I'm takin' the lead!

53
00:05:45,483 --> 00:05:47,067
Hey! That's not fair!

54
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,025
You realize this is cheating!

55
00:05:49,108 --> 00:05:51,483
C'mon, guess we can't
just stand here.

56
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:48,483
[GOU] So that's our official
plan for recruiting

57
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:50,108
new students to the club!

58
00:07:50,192 --> 00:07:52,150
We're gonna get everyone's
attention with this.

59
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:54,650
Trust me! It won't be long
before we'll have fresh,

60
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:57,317
new members who'll have
the best muscles ever!

61
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,025
[ALL]
Yeah!

62
00:08:00,108 --> 00:08:01,900
[GOU] And now, we will
introduce the members

63
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:04,650
of the Iwatobi Swim Club!

64
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:06,317
Our treasurer!

65
00:08:08,483 --> 00:08:09,900
[STUDENTS gasp]

66
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,192
[NAGISA]
Nagisa Hazuki, Second Year!

67
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:16,442
Breaststroke is my fave and
my best feature is my soleus.

68
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:18,650
Ladies.

69
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:20,275
[GOU]
Vice Captain!

70
00:08:21,358 --> 00:08:22,525
[STUDENTS gasp]

71
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:25,358
[HARUKA]
Haruka Nanase, Third Year!

72
00:08:25,442 --> 00:08:28,775
Freestyle is my thing,
and my triceps are guaranteed

73
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:30,567
to drive you out of your mind.

74
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,983
[GOU]
Secretary!

75
00:08:34,442 --> 00:08:35,608
[REI]
Ha!

76
00:08:35,692 --> 00:08:37,608
Rei Ryugazaki, Second Year!

77
00:08:37,692 --> 00:08:40,317
Butterfly expert, who when
asked his best feature,

78
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,733
will answer that his deltoids
and biceps are in a dead heat.

79
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:46,150
[GOU]
And our team captain!

80
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:47,483
[STUDENTS murmur]

81
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:51,567
[MAKOTO]
Makoto Tachibana, Third Year!

82
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,067
I've got backstroke for days!

83
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,858
And traps just as long!

84
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:59,317
[GOU] Join us, and become
a more muscular you!

85
00:09:03,483 --> 00:09:04,900
No one's here!

86
00:09:04,983 --> 00:09:06,150
This sucks.

87
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:07,900
I thought someone would've
shown up for sure.

88
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:10,067
Well, it doesn't matter
how strong we are at running,

89
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,358
we're still only a Swim Club.

90
00:09:13,817 --> 00:09:16,775
[SASABE] Really? That's
unusual coming from Haruka.

91
00:09:16,858 --> 00:09:18,567
Aw, thank you so much for this.

92
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,650
[SASABE]
You think this means the kid

93
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:21,275
might be starting to mature?

94
00:09:21,358 --> 00:09:22,442
Maybe.

95
00:09:22,525 --> 00:09:24,317
But, to be honest,
I was surprised with him

96
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,900
at the race last year, also.

97
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,525
It seems like Nanase
and the others

98
00:09:28,608 --> 00:09:30,483
have something in mind.

99
00:09:33,192 --> 00:09:34,692
[AMAKATA]
They're good boys.

100
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:37,608
You know, it's funny. I've
had such a difficult time

101
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:40,608
figuring out the best way to
help as their faculty advisor,

102
00:09:40,692 --> 00:09:44,233
yet I feel like they always
know how to encourage me.

103
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,192
[SASABE] A lot's happened
in the past few years.

104
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:48,150
I'm just glad he's found
a way to approach swimming

105
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:49,442
that keeps him true to himself

106
00:09:49,525 --> 00:09:51,733
while also maintaining
his talent.

107
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:53,608
He's been fussy about
swimming freestyle

108
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:57,067
since he was little. At least
he's good at it, I guess.

109
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,608
[AMAKATA]
Oh, kids that age.

110
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:47,775
They grow every day,
and in so many ways.

111
00:10:47,858 --> 00:10:50,400
Adolescence is great,
don't you agree?

112
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,150
[SASABE]
Hm. Haruka's already year three.

113
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:54,567
That's right, yeah?

114
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,483
I wonder if he or Makoto
have given a single thought

115
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:58,567
to their futures at all.

116
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,775
[AMAKATA] Probably. Look how
hard they're working now.

117
00:11:01,858 --> 00:11:03,983
If they put even half the
effort into their futures

118
00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:06,567
as they do swimming,
they'll be just fine.

119
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,567
Hopefully you're
right about that.

120
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,317
[RIN]
Hey, uh. You guys.

121
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,942
You ever give any thought
to life after graduation?

122
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:26,150
Not really.

123
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:28,150
So you have no idea
what you're gonna do?

124
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:32,192

sights set as high as you.

You're kidding, right?

126

I've wasted so much time
it's not even funny.

127
00:11:36,692 --> 00:11:40,150
The Nationals this summer are
my last shot at being scouted.

128
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,525
They'll be comin' from all over.

129
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:46,108
I need to batten down.
Focus on bringin' my A-game.

130

But seriously, though.

131
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:53,900
What're gonna do once
high school's just a memory?

Wish I could say.

Truth is, I haven't decided.

How can you not have a plan?

136

it's a city tournament,

137
00:12:15,775 --> 00:12:17,233
I guess we won't
make it mandatory

have to go if you don't want,

more relaxed atmosphere

than the Regionals.
Rather nice, if you ask me.

the 100-meter backstroke,

why not the 100-meter?

work cut out for him either way.

that to compete with Haru.

will be more my speed.

313
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:14,817
you cleared District.

314
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,442
[NAGISA]
Because he's amazing!

315
00:20:16,525 --> 00:20:18,150
[REI] Thank you.
That means a lot to me.

316
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:19,900
I worked so hard

317
00:20:19,983 --> 00:20:22,858
[AMAKATA]
Tachibana, Hazuki, Ryugazaki.

318
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:24,733
Bravo to all of you!

319
00:20:24,817 --> 00:20:25,983
It must feel wonderful,

320
00:20:26,067 --> 00:20:28,233
knowing you're on your
way to Regionals!

321
00:20:28,317 --> 00:20:30,317
All we need now is for Haru
to place in freestyle.

322
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,858
Ha! You gotta be kidding me!

323
00:20:31,942 --> 00:20:33,858
He could win
freestyle blindfolded!

324
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,942
Makoto, you're swimmin'
the freestyle, too, right?

325
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:37,108
Two hundred?

326
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:37,900
Wouldn't miss it.

327
00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:39,233
[NAGISA]
I can't wait!

328
00:20:39,317 --> 00:20:40,650
[GOU] Hey, don't forget
that Haru still has a race

329
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:43,525
with my brother, too.
I can't wait for that.

330
00:20:49,358 --> 00:20:50,525
[MAKOTO]
Hey.

331
00:20:53,775 --> 00:20:55,608
Remember our talk.

332
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:02,025
Yeah, no worries.

333
00:21:11,608 --> 00:21:13,608
Wait, those two are racing
against each other?

334
00:21:13,692 --> 00:21:18,733
[whistle blowing]

335
00:21:18,817 --> 00:21:22,108
[REFEREE 6A]
Ready.

336
00:21:22,192 --> 00:21:23,858
--[beep]
--[CROWD] Go!

337
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:29,442
[GOU] Am I seeing things or did
Makoto just pass everyone?

338
00:21:29,525 --> 00:21:30,650
He's taken the lead!

339
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:32,733
Since when is he
faster than Haru?

340
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,442
[RIN] Idiot, slow down.
Just pace yourself.

341
00:21:37,525 --> 00:21:39,442
You'll run outta steam
'fore you hit the final lap.

342
00:21:39,525 --> 00:21:41,275
This ain't the 100-meter.

343
00:21:41,358 --> 00:21:43,275
Seriously, where you gonna
be in the second half

344
00:21:43,358 --> 00:21:45,525
if you go all out in the first?

345
00:21:49,192 --> 00:21:51,775
[MAKOTO]
Haru. I'm gonna need a favor.

346
00:21:54,608 --> 00:21:56,942
I want you to swim against me
with everything you've got.

347
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,108
No holding back.

348
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,108
I need this to be legit.

349
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,067
But, why?

350
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,108
Is this the whole reason you're
doing freestyle tomorrow?

351
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,942
So you can try to beat me?

352
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:13,317
[MAKOTO]
This is our last year.

353
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,858
I mean, once it's
over, it's over.

354
00:22:17,192 --> 00:22:19,192
[MAKOTO]
So before we graduate...

355
00:22:19,275 --> 00:22:23,400
I just... I want one
all-out race against you.

356
00:22:23,483 --> 00:22:26,400
What do you get out
of this? Why do you swim?

357
00:22:30,275 --> 00:22:31,650
Because it's fun.

358
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:35,692
Because it's--it's something
we do together as a team.

359
00:22:37,067 --> 00:22:41,858
[MAKOTO] But... I wanna know
what it feels like to beat you.

360
00:22:49,817 --> 00:22:50,942
[REI]
Last turn!

361
00:22:52,733 --> 00:22:54,442
[REI]
Haruka's caught up!

362
00:22:54,525 --> 00:22:57,817
Makoto started strong,
but he's losing speed.

363
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,733
What did I say?

364
00:22:58,817 --> 00:23:06,192
[MAKOTO panting]

You okay?

371
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:39,775
I lost!

372
00:23:45,275 --> 00:23:46,942
Congratulations.
Between the two of us,

373
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:49,317
you're still the
best in the water.

374
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,150
How awesome is that?

You're so weird.

This is what we're here for.

379
00:24:06,567 --> 00:24:07,983
Haru versus Rin.

00:24:22,608 --> 00:24:23,942
Let's go, Haruka!

Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,025
Let's go, Haruka!

387
00:24:27,108 --> 00:24:28,400
Yeah! Fight!

Kill it, Rin. Come on.

390
00:24:37,358 --> 00:24:38,442
[REI]
Unbelievable.

391
00:24:38,525 --> 00:24:40,525
No one else even
touches those two.

392
00:24:40,608 --> 00:24:41,900
It's insane.

393
00:24:48,317 --> 00:24:50,358
[CROWD cheers]

394
00:24:50,442 --> 00:24:52,608
And it's official,
Haruka's first place.

395
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:54,275
They were less than
a second apart!

396
00:24:54,358 --> 00:24:56,775
Rin was behind him by .02.

397
00:24:56,858 --> 00:24:58,775
Wow. That's incredible!

398
00:24:58,858 --> 00:25:01,358
[AMAKATA] Well, that was
heart-stopping, wasn't it?

399
00:25:01,442 --> 00:25:02,942
Nanase doesn't disappoint!

400
00:25:03,025 --> 00:25:04,900
No joke! So conflicted.

401
00:25:04,983 --> 00:25:06,317
[laughs]

402
00:25:10,067 --> 00:25:11,275
[NAGISA]
Hey.

403
00:25:11,358 --> 00:25:13,400
I'm not sure I understand.
Why'd you race Haru

404
00:25:13,483 --> 00:25:15,650
in the 200 again?

405
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:17,025
Well, what can I say?

406
00:25:17,108 --> 00:25:19,525
Sometimes you just have
to know how you measure up.

407
00:25:22,817 --> 00:25:24,817
[MAKOTO]
Sometimes...

408
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,858
Like, maybe, when you're
not sure where you stand.

409
00:25:33,192 --> 00:25:34,400
[NAGISA]
Gotcha.

410
00:25:40,775 --> 00:25:43,192
[MAKOTO]
Haru, you were totally amazing.

411
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,858
After today, I bet
scouts from all over

412
00:25:44,942 --> 00:25:47,150
the country'll have
their eyes on you.

413
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:54,442
So, uh, what are you gonna do
if one of 'em approaches you?

414
00:25:54,525 --> 00:25:56,108
Given it any thought?

415
00:25:59,942 --> 00:26:01,775
I'm not gonna "do" anything.

416
00:26:01,858 --> 00:26:03,733
[MAKOTO]
What's that supposed to mean?

417
00:26:03,817 --> 00:26:06,483
[HARUKA] It means that I don't
care about being scouted.

418
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,983
I swim 'cause I
want to. That's it.

419
00:26:14,317 --> 00:26:15,733
What's wrong?

420
00:26:15,817 --> 00:26:18,817
[MAKOTO] Uh-- Nothing. Guess
I'll see you in the morning.

421
00:26:27,483 --> 00:26:29,983
[RIN] No matter who wins
today, no hard feelings.

422
00:26:30,067 --> 00:26:33,150
Deal? Just make sure you
make it to Regionals.

423
00:26:33,233 --> 00:26:34,983
[HARUKA]
Like I need you to remind me.

424
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:37,150
[laughs] I let you walk away

425
00:26:37,233 --> 00:26:39,192
with the freestyle
race yesterday.

426
00:26:39,275 --> 00:26:41,483
But today'll be
a different story.

427
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,900
I'm sure the boys'll
be okay out there.

428
00:26:43,983 --> 00:26:48,233
[whistle blowing]

429

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,317
[AMAKATA]
It's okay!

433
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,858
I think Makoto can
make up for it!

434
00:27:02,942 --> 00:27:03,858
[MOMOTARO]

435
00:27:03,942 --> 00:27:04,942
[IWASHIMIZU]
Looking good, Momo!

436
00:27:05,025 --> 00:27:06,525
[UOZUMI]
You guys, he's taking the lead!

437
00:27:06,608 --> 00:27:08,108
Yeah. Fight!

[SAMEZUKA CLUB]
Fight! Fight!

439
00:27:12,817 --> 00:27:14,567
[SASABE]
Makoto is catching up to him!

440
00:27:18,442 --> 00:27:20,317
Go! Nagisa!

441
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:32,442
His usual extension
on the return leg

442
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,233
doesn't seem to be working!

443
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:41,025
[GOU] Samezuka's maintaining
the lead after the exchange!

444
00:27:42,608 --> 00:27:45,025
There's a chance Rei may
not be able to catch up!

445
00:27:45,108 --> 00:27:47,025
Samezuka's just so fast!

446
00:27:55,692 --> 00:27:57,317
Haru!

447
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,525
Swim, Haru!

448
00:27:59,608 --> 00:28:01,358
[REI]
Guys, Rin is turning first!

449
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:25,483
[RIN]
Yeah!

450
00:28:26,525 --> 00:28:28,525
[SAMEZUKA CLUB]
All right, all right, Samezuka!

451
00:28:28,608 --> 00:28:31,233
We just lost.

452
00:28:31,317 --> 00:28:33,317
But they made it
past the prelims.

453
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,567
Which means we move on to
the regional tournament!

454
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:37,692
Good job.

455
00:28:37,775 --> 00:28:39,108
[MOMOTARO]
Hey-hey, we got first place!

456
00:28:39,192 --> 00:28:39,733
[RIN]
Yeah!

457
00:28:39,817 --> 00:28:42,025
Way to go! Woo!

458
00:28:50,942 --> 00:28:53,025
[NAGISA] They made a real
banner for us this time.

459
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:54,567
[MAKOTO] Last year they
reused the one they had

460
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,900
for the Judo Club, remember?

461
00:28:55,983 --> 00:28:57,942
[NAGISA] Yeah. So can
anyone tell me why

462
00:28:58,025 --> 00:28:59,858
I don't feel very
happy right now?

463
00:28:59,942 --> 00:29:01,317
Is that a rhetorical question?

464
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,775
It's because we lost
to Samezuka, obviously!

465
00:29:03,858 --> 00:29:05,150
Oh, come on, people,
you're telling me

466
00:29:05,233 --> 00:29:07,233
that doesn't chap your
hide the tiniest bit?

467
00:29:07,317 --> 00:29:10,400
I'm ecstatic we
advanced and all.

468
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:13,483
But victory tastes bitter when
one must share it with a rival.

469
00:29:13,567 --> 00:29:14,858
We were made fools of.

470
00:29:14,942 --> 00:29:17,525
I've never been so
humiliated in my life.

471
00:29:20,858 --> 00:29:22,525
[HARUKA]
Then how 'bout we practice?

472
00:29:22,608 --> 00:29:23,442
[REI, NAGISA, MAKOTO]
Okay!

473
00:29:23,525 --> 00:29:25,150
[GOU]
You guys, look at this!

474
00:29:25,233 --> 00:29:27,650
Makoto, Rei and Nagisa
all advanced to Regionals,

475
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:29,900
but your times in the
individual competitions

476
00:29:29,983 --> 00:29:31,942
were barely fast enough
to make the cut.

477
00:29:32,025 --> 00:29:34,025
See, I've got the
numbers right here!

478
00:29:34,108 --> 00:29:36,858
All the top spots are filled
with Samezuka swimmers!

479
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,567
[MAKOTO] Well, I suppose
our times can't stand up

480
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,775
against Samezuka
Academy after all.

481
00:29:40,858 --> 00:29:42,692
[GOU] The only one who
managed to stay at the top

482
00:29:42,775 --> 00:29:44,983
of his category was
Haru in freestyle.

483
00:29:45,067 --> 00:29:46,442
The long and short
of it is this:

484
00:29:46,525 --> 00:29:49,317
Iwatobi is a long way from
being able to compete.

485
00:29:50,567 --> 00:29:51,942
Here's the deal.

486
00:29:52,025 --> 00:29:54,067
We can't be satisfied with
mediocre results like this.

487
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,233
We've gotta work
harder than ever--

488
00:29:55,317 --> 00:29:57,983
[AMAKATA]
Big news, everyone! Big news!

489
00:29:58,067 --> 00:30:00,358
[MAKOTO]
Miss A? What's the matter?

490
00:30:00,442 --> 00:30:03,275
I just now got a call
from a talent scout

491
00:30:03,358 --> 00:30:05,983
who's interested in
taking a look at Haruka!

492
00:30:06,067 --> 00:30:07,400
[REI, NAGISA, MAKOTO gasp]

493
00:30:08,775 --> 00:30:09,942
[AMAKATA]
They said they saw you

494
00:30:10,025 --> 00:30:11,983
in the 100-meter freestyle
race two days ago.

495
00:30:12,067 --> 00:30:13,108
Yeah, that's great news.

496
00:30:13,192 --> 00:30:14,775
Wow, Haru, you did it!

497
00:30:14,858 --> 00:30:16,233
Well, I suppose this
gives you an answer

498
00:30:16,317 --> 00:30:18,108
about what to do
after graduation.

499
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:20,108
There's an old saying
that applies here.

500
00:30:20,192 --> 00:30:22,567
"Tomorrow will take care of
itself if you give it a chance.

501
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,483
And the choices you make
today will help define

502
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:26,150
the future of your tomorrows"...

503
00:30:26,233 --> 00:30:28,233
[splash]

504
00:30:28,317 --> 00:30:29,733
[MAKOTO]
Haru.

505
00:30:35,192 --> 00:30:37,858
I wonder what Haru wants
to do after graduation.

506
00:30:37,942 --> 00:30:39,567
Well, I'm not exactly sure.

507
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:42,108
But I know he wrote "Free"
on his career-planning thing.

508
00:30:42,192 --> 00:30:44,567
"Free"? What is that
supposed to mean?

509
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:48,067
Uh. He can't possibly
mean "freeter," can he?

510
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,900
Probably not, no.

511
00:30:49,983 --> 00:30:52,733
Hey, maybe he means
"freelance competitive swimmer?"

512
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:54,983
Yeah, I don't think
it's that either.

513
00:30:55,067 --> 00:30:56,692
Then what does it mean?

514
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:01,317
Could be anything, really.

515
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,525
Maybe at the end of the day,

516
00:31:02,608 --> 00:31:05,483
in Haru's mind, "free"
just means "free."

517
00:31:05,567 --> 00:31:07,775
Great, now I'm really confused.

518
00:31:07,858 --> 00:31:12,442
[sighs] Although, that would
be in character for the man.

519
00:31:14,567 --> 00:31:17,317
[AMAKATA] There was another
great offer from a scout today.

520
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,400
But Haruka doesn't
seem to care one bit.

521
00:31:19,483 --> 00:31:20,942
Apparently, they
were beating down

522
00:31:21,025 --> 00:31:22,525
my brother's door, too!

523
00:31:22,608 --> 00:31:24,067
I wouldn't worry about
Haru that much,

524
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,275
he's in a great position.

525
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:26,692
He's got lots of options.

526
00:31:26,775 --> 00:31:29,067
He'll figure something out.

527
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,817
I wonder if that's
what he really wants.

528
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,817
[GOU]
Huh?

529
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,192
[MAKOTO]
Oh, nothing.

530
00:31:33,275 --> 00:31:35,233
Speaking of which,
have you decided

531
00:31:35,317 --> 00:31:38,317
what you're gonna
do after graduation?

532
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,483
Well, uh...

533
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:41,400
To tell you the truth,
I don't know yet.

534
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:43,275
I might go to community college.

535
00:31:43,358 --> 00:31:45,192
Wow, that surprises me.

536
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:56,108
[NAGISA]
Wow, Mako, you got "best luck!"

537
00:31:56,192 --> 00:31:57,442
Oh, that's super good!

538
00:31:57,525 --> 00:31:58,983
"You will win multiple contests!

539
00:31:59,067 --> 00:32:01,192
A thousand blessings
follow you there!

540
00:32:01,275 --> 00:32:03,692
Your lucky directions
are north and east!"

541
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:09,900
I just want you to know,
whatever anyone else says,

542
00:32:09,983 --> 00:32:11,942
I think your
swimming is sublime.

543
00:32:13,108 --> 00:32:15,192
[REI] I don't base that
on theory or calculations

544
00:32:15,275 --> 00:32:16,775
or anything of the sort.

545
00:32:16,858 --> 00:32:18,483
There's simply a power in it,

546
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:20,983
one that inspires
me to outdo myself.

547
00:32:21,067 --> 00:32:22,942
It's freedom.

548
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:24,358
Rei.

549
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,025
[REI] No matter what happens,
as long as you're free,

550
00:32:26,108 --> 00:32:28,483
you'll be happy till
the end of your days.

551
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:30,608
True, the word has
multiple meanings.

552
00:32:30,692 --> 00:32:32,608
But to me, really being
free means not being

553
00:32:32,692 --> 00:32:34,733
held captive by
anyone or anything.

554
00:32:34,817 --> 00:32:36,150
It means possessing
a free spirit

555
00:32:36,233 --> 00:32:38,067
and truly following your heart.

556
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:40,400
That's why it doesn't
matter what you choose.

557
00:32:40,483 --> 00:32:44,108
As long as Haruka stays true
to Haruka, all else is a vapor.

558
00:32:44,192 --> 00:32:46,400
Freedom is being yourself.

559
00:32:49,858 --> 00:32:51,650
[REI]
Oh, dear. How awkward.

560
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:53,858
Who am I to tell you
all this, right?

561
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,900
[NAGISA]
You made this training regimen?

562
00:33:07,983 --> 00:33:10,067
[HARUKA] Well, I modified
Gou's a little bit.

563
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,192
What? This is incredible.

564
00:33:11,275 --> 00:33:13,275
You added practice
for relay exchanges.

565
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:14,817
This is rather
exceptionally clever--

566
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,525
we can drill those
hand-offs over and over.

567
00:33:16,608 --> 00:33:18,150
If we cut down on our
exchange time enough,

568
00:33:18,233 --> 00:33:20,525
winning Regionals is
a genuine possibility!

569
00:33:20,608 --> 00:33:22,067
[HARUKA]
That's right.

570
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,567
[REI] If we stick to this plan
and work together as a team,

571
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:26,692
we can definitely close the
gap between us and Samezuka!

572
00:33:28,817 --> 00:33:30,150
It's important to me
that you all know

573
00:33:30,233 --> 00:33:31,983
what I want right now.

574
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:34,983
And more than anything else,
I wanna swim with you guys.

575
00:33:35,067 --> 00:33:36,942
We feel the same way, Haru!

576
00:33:37,025 --> 00:33:39,483
So let's make it happen!
Let's work our tails off!

577
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:42,483
Let's swim, till Rin and
his brood concede victory!

578
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:43,775
I'm in.

579
00:33:49,608 --> 00:33:50,817
[STAFF]
How are you this evening?

580
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,192
[MAKOTO]
Can't complain.

581
00:33:55,192 --> 00:33:56,608
All right.

582
00:33:56,692 --> 00:33:58,108
Coach Sasabe! Hey!

583
00:33:58,192 --> 00:34:00,483
Well! If it isn't ol' Makoto!

584
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:01,650
[MAKOTO]
Jeez, it looks like things

585
00:34:01,733 --> 00:34:03,358
are pretty busy here tonight.

586
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:04,692
Yeah.

587
00:34:04,775 --> 00:34:06,025
We're hoppin', all right,
which is great and all,

588
00:34:06,108 --> 00:34:07,942
just sorta hard on
a skeleton crew.

589
00:34:08,025 --> 00:34:10,108
I'm sorry I haven't been able
to watch your practices.

590
00:34:10,192 --> 00:34:11,233
It's been crazy.

591
00:34:11,317 --> 00:34:12,525
Wow.

592
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,608
Oh, I've got a little
somethin' for you.

593
00:34:14,692 --> 00:34:17,358
Here, Gou wanted me to pass off
the final numbers from District.

594
00:34:17,442 --> 00:34:19,692
[GIRL 8C] Coach Sasabe,
hurry up! We're waiting!

595
00:34:19,775 --> 00:34:21,317
[SASABE]
Ah! Right!

596
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,108
Have no fear, I'm on my way!

597
00:34:24,192 --> 00:34:25,192
Hey, Coach, wait!

598
00:34:25,275 --> 00:34:26,192
[SASABE]
Huh?

599
00:34:26,275 --> 00:34:27,900
Uh, I could maybe
give you a hand.

600
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:29,275
What? Are you serious?

601
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,108
'Course. Unless I'd
just be in the way.

602
00:34:33,442 --> 00:34:34,692
[NAGISA]
What?

603
00:34:34,775 --> 00:34:36,483
So you're working as an
assistant for Coach Sasabe

604
00:34:36,567 --> 00:34:38,442
and teaching kids
how to dog paddle?

605
00:34:38,525 --> 00:34:40,025
[MAKOTO]
Coach has done so much for us.

606
00:34:40,108 --> 00:34:42,567
I thought it might be nice
to return the favor, you know?

607
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,817
He can use the help.

608
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,733
I think that we should
work together as a team

609
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,608
to get ISCR out of the weeds!

610
00:34:47,692 --> 00:34:49,733
We've got your back,
Mako! Am I right?

611
00:34:49,817 --> 00:34:51,900
I mean, you'll help us,
too, won't you, Rei?

612
00:34:51,983 --> 00:34:53,525
Oh, definitely!

613
00:34:53,608 --> 00:34:55,567
That's really nice.
I appreciate it.

614
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,817
Except, don't you guys,
have better things to do

615
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,775
than watch a bunch
of kids tread water?

616
00:34:59,858 --> 00:35:01,817
Yeah, but--!

617
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,192
What about you, Haru?

618
00:35:03,275 --> 00:35:04,983
Don't you think we ought
to be there to help him out?

619
00:35:05,067 --> 00:35:07,150
All I care about is swimming.

620
00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:09,483
Makoto can do whatever he wants.

621
00:35:09,567 --> 00:35:10,358
Haru!

622
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,025
Okay, well.

623
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,525
[KIDS]
Okay, we're ready when you are!

624
00:35:15,608 --> 00:35:17,775
Just always remember
to do your best!

625
00:35:17,858 --> 00:35:18,900
I have a question.

626
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:20,775
What are we gonna
be working on today?

627
00:35:20,858 --> 00:35:23,233
I thought we'd start things off
with a little kicking practice.

628
00:35:23,317 --> 00:35:24,150
How does that sound?

629
00:35:24,233 --> 00:35:25,650
[KIDS]
Awesome!

630
00:35:27,775 --> 00:35:30,400
[KIDS chattering]

631
00:35:30,483 --> 00:35:31,858
Bye, Coach! I'll
see you tomorrow!

632
00:35:31,942 --> 00:35:33,900
Bye. This was fun!

633
00:35:33,983 --> 00:35:35,900
'Kay, see ya next time!

634
00:35:35,983 --> 00:35:37,400
[GIRL 8B]
Bye, bye!

635
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:42,942
[MAKOTO]
Hayato.

636
00:35:43,025 --> 00:35:44,525
Hey. You okay?

637
00:35:44,608 --> 00:35:47,525
What's wrong? You seem upset.

638
00:35:49,317 --> 00:35:52,067
It's swimming. I hate it.

639
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,317
[gasps]

640
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,275
[KISUMI]
Hayato!

641
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:56,150
[HAYATO]
Big brother!

642
00:35:56,233 --> 00:35:57,817
Really sorry I'm late, buddy!

643
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,483
That's Kisumi.

644
00:36:00,775 --> 00:36:03,483
[MAKOTO]
Kisumi! What's up?

645
00:36:03,567 --> 00:36:06,483
Makoto? Hey, man!

646
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:09,983
This is nuts. I haven't
seen you in forever!

647
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:11,567
Yeah, it's been a while.

648
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:14,692
I guess we haven't seen
each other since junior high.

649
00:36:15,942 --> 00:36:18,525
[MAKOTO] Hayato told me
that he hates swimming.

650
00:36:18,608 --> 00:36:20,900
Any idea what that's about?

651
00:36:20,983 --> 00:36:24,608
If I knew why, it might
help me reach him.

652
00:36:24,692 --> 00:36:27,733
Truth is, it's
probably my fault.

653
00:36:27,817 --> 00:36:28,983
[MAKOTO]
Huh?

654
00:36:29,067 --> 00:36:30,733
[KISUMI]
A while back...

655
00:36:30,817 --> 00:36:32,108
We were out on
a boat in the ocean

656
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:33,858
with the rest of the family.

657
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,983
Hayato got to screwin'
around on the deck,

658
00:36:36,067 --> 00:36:38,317
and he fell overboard.

659
00:36:39,692 --> 00:36:41,025
[KISUMI] We're lucky they
got to him as quickly

660
00:36:41,108 --> 00:36:43,317
as they did or, well...

661
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,567
Poor kid.

662
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:47,567
Whole thing must have
been terrifying for him.

663
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,567
That does sound really scary.

664
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:50,692
[KISUMI]
Ever since the incident,

665
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:53,275
he's hated his swimming
class at school.

666
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:54,692
And if I'd been better
about watching him

667
00:36:54,775 --> 00:36:57,442
on that stupid boat, none
of this would've happened.

668
00:36:57,525 --> 00:36:59,275
He wouldn't be afraid.

669
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:00,650
Kisumi...

670
00:37:00,733 --> 00:37:03,233
[KISUMI] But, as much as
I want him to get past it--

671
00:37:03,317 --> 00:37:04,900
[MAKOTO]
Wait.

672
00:37:04,983 --> 00:37:08,150
If it's cool, I wanna
help Hayato learn to swim.

673
00:37:08,233 --> 00:37:09,775
You do?

674
00:37:09,858 --> 00:37:11,567
You wanna hear
something kinda strange?

675
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:15,608
He reminds me a little of myself
when I was that age, ya know?

676
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:19,150
Look, neither of you
should give up just yet.

677
00:37:19,233 --> 00:37:22,317
So please, let me try.

678
00:37:24,692 --> 00:37:26,733
You really do love swimming
more than anything else,

679
00:37:26,817 --> 00:37:28,400
don't you, Makoto?

680
00:37:30,608 --> 00:37:31,817
All right.

681
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,025
I'm leaving Hayato's
future to you, my friend.

682
00:37:34,108 --> 00:37:35,942
If there's anything I can
do to help along the way,

683
00:37:36,025 --> 00:37:37,317
just say the word.

684
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,692
Thanks. I won't let you down.

685
00:37:39,775 --> 00:37:40,650
[KISUMI]
Hm?

686
00:37:40,733 --> 00:37:42,025
Oh! Hey there!

687
00:37:42,108 --> 00:37:43,400
[KISUMI]
Whoa. Haru!

688
00:37:43,483 --> 00:37:45,275
I haven't seen you
in forever, buddy!

689
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:48,400
Wow! Oh, man, it's like
junior high all over again.

690
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:51,358
We met right after Rin went
to study abroad, didn't we?

691
00:37:51,442 --> 00:37:53,150
You always seemed
so down about that.

692
00:37:53,233 --> 00:37:55,150
Anyway, how've you been?

693
00:37:55,233 --> 00:37:57,358
Kisumi, you went to the
same elementary school

694
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:58,525
as Rin, didn't you?

695
00:37:58,608 --> 00:38:01,442
Oh! Yeah! Sosuke
went there, too.

696
00:38:01,525 --> 00:38:02,525
Makoto.

697
00:38:02,608 --> 00:38:04,692
[MAKOTO]
Crap! Is it that late already?

698
00:38:04,775 --> 00:38:05,817
Hey, let's go.

699
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,817
What's wrong, you
mad or somethin'?

700
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,317
It's been so long, I thought
you'd be glad to see me.

701
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,900
[sighs] Don't worry, I'm glad.

702
00:38:12,983 --> 00:38:15,108
Heh! Way to sell it.

703
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:16,775
[HAYATO]
Hey, big brother!

704
00:38:16,858 --> 00:38:17,775
[KISUMI]
Hayato!

705
00:38:17,858 --> 00:38:19,067
Well, I gotta run, you guys.

706
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,692
But we should catch up
or somethin' sometime!

707
00:38:21,775 --> 00:38:23,608
[sighs]

708
00:38:23,692 --> 00:38:25,567
[MAKOTO]
Guess we better get going, too.

709
00:38:29,233 --> 00:38:30,983
[MAKOTO] I'm afraid if I
give him too much advice,

710
00:38:31,067 --> 00:38:33,108
I might confuse him
and make him more scared

711
00:38:33,192 --> 00:38:36,192
to swim than he already is.

712
00:38:36,275 --> 00:38:38,692
We were all scared of
swimming at one point.

713
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:40,192
Think about what
you did to overcome

714
00:38:40,275 --> 00:38:42,317
your fears and start there.

715
00:38:43,983 --> 00:38:46,317
[MAKOTO]
Well, when I first started out,

716
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,608
I realized when I
swam the backstroke

717
00:38:48,692 --> 00:38:50,650
I could see the sky.

718
00:38:50,733 --> 00:38:52,900
And then I wasn't
scared anymore.

719
00:38:53,942 --> 00:38:55,900
[MAKOTO] But, these days
they don't usually teach

720
00:38:55,983 --> 00:38:59,567
backstroke until much later,
so that doesn't really help us.

721
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:01,608
[HARUKA] Yeah, but who
cares what "they" do?

722
00:39:01,692 --> 00:39:02,608
Huh?

723
00:39:02,692 --> 00:39:03,525
You're the teacher.

724
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:05,358
Do it how you wanna do it.

725
00:39:05,442 --> 00:39:06,650
Yeah?

726
00:39:09,525 --> 00:39:12,150
You know, you're right.

727
00:39:12,233 --> 00:39:14,108
I might just give it a try.

728
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:20,275
[MAKOTO]
Hayato.

729
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,817
I've got an idea.
How 'bout we try

730
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,733
a different style of swimming?

731
00:39:23,817 --> 00:39:25,025
It's one where you
don't have to put

732
00:39:25,108 --> 00:39:26,483
your face in the water.

733
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:29,358
You know, you can even look
at the sky while you swim.

734
00:39:29,442 --> 00:39:30,567
That sounds cool.

735
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:32,650
But there's no way
I could do that.

736
00:39:32,733 --> 00:39:34,400
I promise to hold you
up the whole time,

737
00:39:34,483 --> 00:39:35,983
so don't worry.

738
00:39:36,067 --> 00:39:38,483
No matter what happens,
I won't let you sink.

739
00:39:38,567 --> 00:39:44,900
I can't do it. Because--
'Cause I'm... scared!

740
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:48,358
[MAKOTO] It's okay. I won't
let go, you have my word.

741
00:39:48,442 --> 00:39:49,858
Trust me.

742
00:39:52,275 --> 00:39:55,233
But isn't it... scary?

743
00:39:55,317 --> 00:39:57,025
Only till it's not.

744
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,483
[GIRL 8B]
We believe in you!

745
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:02,567
[GIRL 8A]
You can do it!

746
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,900
Let's go.

747
00:40:03,983 --> 00:40:05,483
All you have to do is kick
your legs in the water

748
00:40:05,567 --> 00:40:07,608
to move forward. You got this!

749
00:40:08,692 --> 00:40:11,650
[MAKOTO]
Okay, now slowly open your eyes.

Wow! The backstroke?

753
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,483
High five!

[MAKOTO]
Hayato?

761
00:40:54,067 --> 00:40:55,358
So, I uh...

762
00:40:55,442 --> 00:40:58,775
Well, I want you to know...

763
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:00,483
I'm not afraid anymore!

764
00:41:00,567 --> 00:41:02,692
It was really fun!

765
00:41:05,733 --> 00:41:08,483
That's because you worked
so hard out there.

766
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:13,233
[gasps] Wow. Thank you.
This was amazing, Coach!

767
00:41:13,317 --> 00:41:14,775
[MAKOTO chuckles]

768
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,108
[MAKOTO]
Good work today!

769
00:41:20,192 --> 00:41:22,233
[STAFF]
Yeah, you, too!

770
00:41:22,317 --> 00:41:23,900
Hey, Makoto, hold up a sec!

771
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:26,067
I wanted to let you know I
hired a new part-timer today,

772
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,067
so we won't need ya anymore.
You're off the hook.

773
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,358
It'll be a week
before he starts,

774
00:41:30,442 --> 00:41:32,275
so I can use you till then.

775
00:41:32,358 --> 00:41:34,775
What's wrong? I thought
you would be thrilled.

776
00:41:34,858 --> 00:41:36,525
Uh...

777
00:41:36,608 --> 00:41:37,858
Oh, yeah.

00:41:37,942 --> 00:41:40,317
Well, thanks for the help
and be safe goin' home.

Yeah, but--

783
00:41:55,067 --> 00:41:56,317
[AMAKATA]
It's way past closing time.

784
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,108
The guidance counselor
is going to blow a gasket

785
00:41:58,192 --> 00:41:59,817
if he sees you boys
here at this hour.

786
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,025
We're comin' up on the last
week before Regionals.

787
00:42:02,108 --> 00:42:04,108
We gotta squeeze in all
the practice we can.

788
00:42:04,192 --> 00:42:05,817
Our times are good,
but the exchanges

789
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,775
need tweaking if we
expect to have a shot.

790
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,442
Whaddya say we
give it another go?

791
00:42:09,525 --> 00:42:10,275
Sure.

792
00:42:10,358 --> 00:42:11,733
[AMAKATA]
Exchanges?

793
00:42:11,817 --> 00:42:12,900
[MAKOTO]
Right.

794
00:42:12,983 --> 00:42:14,442
Those milliseconds
between one guy touching

795
00:42:14,525 --> 00:42:16,525
the platform and the
next one divin' in.

796
00:42:16,608 --> 00:42:18,775
Tightening up that trade-off
moment is what separates

797
00:42:18,858 --> 00:42:20,650
the men from the boys.

798
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:24,525
[MAKOTO] The idea is to predict
your partner's end time.

799
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:26,442
If you can anticipate the
moment he's gonna touch

800
00:42:26,525 --> 00:42:28,358
the platform without
havin' to watch him,

801
00:42:28,442 --> 00:42:29,567
you can tweak your dive stance

802
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,775
to get the most
out of your entry.

803
00:42:31,858 --> 00:42:34,400
We're trying to shave our
exchange times down to zero.

804
00:42:34,483 --> 00:42:36,025
Isn't that cutting
it awfully close?

805
00:42:36,108 --> 00:42:37,525
I mean, what happens
if you hit the water

806
00:42:37,608 --> 00:42:39,025
before the other's
reached the wall?

807
00:42:39,108 --> 00:42:40,567
Instant disqualification.

808
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:42,358
It's just one of the
risks you learn to accept

809
00:42:42,442 --> 00:42:43,525
for the sake of the team.

810
00:42:43,608 --> 00:42:45,650
Miss A, we know it's
late, but mastering

811
00:42:45,733 --> 00:42:47,275
this technique is
gonna give us an edge

812
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:49,608
against the competition.

813
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,192
[PRINCIPAL 9A]
Practice is running long, I see.

814
00:42:52,275 --> 00:42:54,275
[MAKOTO]
Oh. Hello, sir.

815
00:42:54,358 --> 00:42:55,858
[AMAKATA]
Oh, no, it's the principal!

816
00:42:55,942 --> 00:42:57,317
I'm dreadfully sorry, sir!

817
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,733
I just told these boys it's
well past time to wrap up!

818
00:42:59,817 --> 00:43:02,150
[COUNSELOR 9A]
Ah, you're fine. No harm done.

819
00:43:02,233 --> 00:43:03,608
[PRINCIPAL 9A]
Stay as long as you need.

820
00:43:03,692 --> 00:43:06,400
It's not often one our own
gets scouted by the pros.

821
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:07,608
Eh, Nanase?

822
00:43:07,692 --> 00:43:09,817
We haven't been this
excited about Regionals

823
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,275
in quite some time.

824
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:14,483
Every member of the faculty
is as thrilled as can be.

825
00:43:14,567 --> 00:43:16,525
Do your school proud.

826
00:43:18,442 --> 00:43:19,733
Yes, sir.

827
00:43:21,233 --> 00:43:23,108
[NAGISA]
This place is huge!

828
00:43:23,192 --> 00:43:25,733
Wow. Quite an upgrade from
where we stayed last year.

829
00:43:25,817 --> 00:43:27,650
[MAKOTO] Watch us get
stuck in a broom closet

830
00:43:27,733 --> 00:43:29,275
while Miss A and Gou
get a tricked out

831
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:30,817
presidential suite or somethin'.

832
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,650
[REI] I do not need a flashback
to training camp right now.

833
00:43:33,733 --> 00:43:35,275
Please, it's not the same thing.

834
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:36,483
That's right.

835
00:43:36,567 --> 00:43:37,567
You gentlemen are the
stars of this show,

836
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:39,025
so you get star treatment.

837
00:43:39,108 --> 00:43:41,608
Before you go nuts,
remember the old proverb:

838
00:43:41,692 --> 00:43:43,317
"Nothing in this world
is more expensive

839
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,442
than that which comes free,
for it is invaluable!"

840
00:43:46,525 --> 00:43:48,525
[GOU]
Okay, fellahs! It's chow time!

841
00:43:48,608 --> 00:43:51,400
Miss Amakata gave us enough
cash to feed a small army,

842
00:43:51,483 --> 00:43:52,900
so pick whatever looks good!

843
00:43:52,983 --> 00:43:54,733
Does it have to be healthy?

844
00:43:54,817 --> 00:43:56,067
[HARUKA]
This is my pick.

845
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:57,733
[NAGISA]
Cool!

846
00:43:57,817 --> 00:43:58,858
Naturally.

847
00:43:58,942 --> 00:44:00,108
Of course.

848
00:44:00,192 --> 00:44:02,025
[MIKOSHIBA laughs]
That's a pretty good one,

849
00:44:02,108 --> 00:44:03,275
[GOU]
Is that who I think it is?

850
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:05,400
[REI]
What's he doing here?

851
00:44:05,483 --> 00:44:06,733
Hey!

852
00:44:06,817 --> 00:44:09,400
Gou, sweetheart, we gotta
stop meetin' like this.

853
00:44:09,483 --> 00:44:10,858
[NAGISA, REI, GOU]
Hey, Mikoshiba.

854
00:44:10,942 --> 00:44:12,817
And who might this be?

855
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,358
Ah!

856
00:44:14,442 --> 00:44:16,692
Lemme introduce you to Todou,
my university's top scout!

857
00:44:16,775 --> 00:44:18,233
Seriously?

858
00:44:18,317 --> 00:44:19,233
[MIKOSHIBA] I figured I'd show
him what the Samezuka team's

859
00:44:19,317 --> 00:44:20,442
capable of.

860
00:44:20,525 --> 00:44:22,567
These guys are competing
this weekend, too.

861
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:25,192
Is that by chance
Nanase from Iwatobi?

862
00:44:25,275 --> 00:44:26,525
You bet!

863
00:44:26,608 --> 00:44:28,400
Wait a second, this man's
actually heard of Haru?

864
00:44:28,483 --> 00:44:30,442
[TODOU]
In my line of work, who hasn't?

865
00:44:30,525 --> 00:44:33,192
Hi there. Honor to
meet you, young man.

866
00:44:33,275 --> 00:44:35,567
You've got quite the reputation.

867
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:37,567
After that District
tournament, your freestyle

868
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:40,233
has become something
of a minor legend.

869
00:44:40,317 --> 00:44:42,192
You've been on my
radar for a while.

870
00:44:42,275 --> 00:44:45,025
Mine and every college
with a swim team.

871
00:44:45,108 --> 00:44:47,358
Not to sound preachy,
but are you even aware

872
00:44:47,442 --> 00:44:49,775
of how much potential
you have, son?

873
00:44:49,858 --> 00:44:52,233
Can't let that
talent go to waste.

874
00:44:52,317 --> 00:44:55,858
Stay focused and the sky's
the limit, I assure you.

875
00:44:55,942 --> 00:44:58,733
You'll have lots of eyes
on you in tomorrow's race.

[laughs]

877
00:45:04,608 --> 00:45:06,400
So how long's he
been gone, exactly?

878
00:45:06,483 --> 00:45:09,025
I dunno, he snuck off
while I was in the shower.

879
00:45:09,108 --> 00:45:11,358
You know him, he's probably
out joggin' or whatever.

880
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:12,692
[RIN]
Great.

881
00:45:12,775 --> 00:45:14,442
The entire place is crawling
with college scouts.

882
00:45:14,525 --> 00:45:16,150
Of all nights to go MIA.

883
00:45:16,233 --> 00:45:17,775
That guy is such a loose cannon.

884
00:45:17,858 --> 00:45:20,525
So, d'you wanna talk to him
about somethin', or...?

885
00:45:20,608 --> 00:45:22,942
[RIN] Yeah, I wanna
ask him if he's decided

886
00:45:23,025 --> 00:45:24,983
what he wants to do yet.

887
00:45:25,067 --> 00:45:26,775
Guess he's just
running away, as usual.

888
00:45:26,858 --> 00:45:30,150
Big shock there.
What is he thinking?

889
00:45:30,233 --> 00:45:31,900
[MAKOTO] I wouldn't
read too much into it.

890
00:45:31,983 --> 00:45:34,525
With some people, it's just
how they clear their heads.

891
00:45:34,608 --> 00:45:36,692
He's more of a doer
than a talker.

892
00:45:39,025 --> 00:45:40,817
Well, that's a polite
way of puttin' it.

Okay. Enough about him.

Uh?

Look, there's no reason
a swimmer at your level

898

wouldn't be scouted by at
least a second-tier school.

Is everything all right, or...?

I just dropped by to talk
to Haru for a minute.

But, I mean, he's
out doing whatever,

to wait. Goodnight.

Now that's the
attitude I wanna see.

I can't see.

The big moment's finally here.

923
00:46:51,733 --> 00:46:52,900
What are you talking about?

924
00:46:52,983 --> 00:46:54,525
This is what we trained for!

925
00:46:54,608 --> 00:46:56,400
The best part is,
there's no telling how many

us out there!

[HARUKA]
Good for them.

928

[REI] Theoretically speaking,
given the waves you've made

929
00:47:01,775 --> 00:47:03,317
at District, it's a
well-nigh impossibility

00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,817
to slip under their radar.
You've got this!

I get it. Stop.

[HARUKA panting]

[AMAKATA] There's an old
saying that's appropriate.

"You may run all you like,

00:54:53,025 --> 00:54:54,442
"Well, uh," what?

1092
00:54:54,525 --> 00:54:56,400
It's just that their relay time
should be getting better,

1093
00:54:56,483 --> 00:54:59,942
but ever since the
tournament, it hasn't been.

1094
00:55:00,025 --> 00:55:02,400
Do you think there's
something wrong with Nanase?

1095
00:55:02,483 --> 00:55:03,983
Huh?

1096
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:06,400
[HANAMURA] That race did seem
a little off, don't you think?

1097
00:55:08,275 --> 00:55:10,192
[NAGISA] I wonder why
Haru keeps staying late

1098
00:55:10,275 --> 00:55:11,692
to practice by himself.

1099
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:13,150
I don't really know.

1100
00:55:13,233 --> 00:55:14,733
I suppose there's
no chance he'll opt

1101
00:55:14,817 --> 00:55:16,817
to swim freestyle at Nationals.

1102
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:17,900
Guess not.

1103
00:55:17,983 --> 00:55:19,192
Honestly, more than
anything else,

1104
00:55:19,275 --> 00:55:21,108
I just hope he's okay.

1105
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:22,400
[NAGISA]
He'll be fine.

1106
00:55:22,483 --> 00:55:24,442
[REI]
Freestyle is everything to him.

1107
00:55:24,525 --> 00:55:26,900
It's part of who
he is as a person.

1108
00:55:26,983 --> 00:55:28,608
Seeing how awesome
he was at freestyle

1109
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:30,567
inspired me to wanna
be great, too.

1110
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:34,233
I thought, "If I could swim
like Haruka, I'd have it made!"

1111
00:55:34,317 --> 00:55:36,358
When we're at Nationals,
if he opts out

1112
00:55:36,442 --> 00:55:38,775
of the individual race,
he'll regret it.

1113
00:55:40,275 --> 00:55:42,150
[REI]
What if relay just isn't him?

1114
00:55:42,233 --> 00:55:45,150
What if he's only
doing it for our sakes?

1115
00:55:45,233 --> 00:55:46,692
What?

1116
00:55:46,775 --> 00:55:49,192
How can you think that Haru
loving the relay is a bad thing?

1117
00:55:49,275 --> 00:55:50,692
I don't understand--
are you saying

1118
00:55:50,775 --> 00:55:51,942
you don't wanna swim with him?

1119
00:55:52,025 --> 00:55:53,317
Of course I want to
swim with Haru--

1120
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,233
it's the only thing I want!

1121
00:55:57,192 --> 00:56:00,650
Trouble is, I just want Haruka
to be the Haruka who's free.

1122
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:02,400
The Haru who swims
because he loves it

1123
00:56:02,483 --> 00:56:04,733
more than anything in the world.

1124
00:56:05,775 --> 00:56:09,025
[NAGISA] Yeah, I know
exactly what you mean.

1125
00:56:10,317 --> 00:56:12,442
[MAKOTO]
Obon's nearly here.

1126
00:56:12,525 --> 00:56:13,525
[HARUKA]
Yeah.

1127
00:56:13,608 --> 00:56:15,567
[MAKOTO]
Will your parents be home soon?

1128
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:16,983
[HARUKA]
Not till the end of summer.

1129
00:56:17,067 --> 00:56:21,358
[MAKOTO chuckles] They're free
spirits just like you.

1130
00:56:21,442 --> 00:56:24,192
Haru! Let's go to the
Fireworks Festival.

1131
00:56:24,275 --> 00:56:26,733
We can invite
Nagisa and Rei, too!

1132
00:56:26,817 --> 00:56:28,483
That sounds fun.

1133
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,108
Well, bye.

1134
00:56:33,192 --> 00:56:34,442
Hey, wait!

1135
00:56:35,775 --> 00:56:36,983
I was thinking.

1136
00:56:37,067 --> 00:56:39,817
About what'll happen
when we graduate.

1137
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,067
I don't really wanna
talk about that.

1138
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:43,400
No! Uh... It's not
what you think!

1139
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,483
[REN]
Big brother!

1140
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,692
--[MAKOTO] Whoa!
--[REN] Hi!

1141
00:56:46,775 --> 00:56:48,192
Hope you're hungry,
'cause dinner's ready!

1142
00:56:48,275 --> 00:56:49,942
Hey, you should come eat, too!

1143
00:56:50,025 --> 00:56:52,108
Yeah, we have plenty of food!

1144
00:56:52,192 --> 00:56:53,858
Today's not a good day for me.

1145
00:56:53,942 --> 00:56:55,108
[RAN]
Aw!

1146
00:56:55,192 --> 00:56:56,733
[REN] You promise you'll
eat with us next time?

1147
00:56:56,817 --> 00:56:58,567
Deal.

1148
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:00,483
[REN, RAN]
Good night, Haru.

1149
00:57:03,067 --> 00:57:04,317
[GOU]
Everybody pay attention.

1150
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,858
I took the liberty
of creating a chart

1151
00:57:05,942 --> 00:57:08,858
that shows all of
your race times.

1152
00:57:08,942 --> 00:57:10,192
But according to this, our times

1153
00:57:10,275 --> 00:57:11,608
aren't really
improving that much.

1154
00:57:11,692 --> 00:57:12,692
Yes, I know.

1155
00:57:12,775 --> 00:57:14,400
These stats are after Regionals.

1156
00:57:14,483 --> 00:57:16,650
Individual times have
improved quite a bit.

1157
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:17,900
But for some strange reason,

1158
00:57:17,983 --> 00:57:19,733
your relay times
have leveled off.

1159
00:57:19,817 --> 00:57:21,942
I don't understand.
How is that possible?

1160
00:57:22,025 --> 00:57:24,608
Does this mean we do worse
when we swim together?

1161
00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:26,317
[REI]
That can't be true!

1162
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,442
[GOU] Whatever it means,
it's a problem.

1163
00:57:28,525 --> 00:57:30,442
To start with, Coach Sasabe
is going to adjust

1164
00:57:30,525 --> 00:57:31,858
your training regimen.

1165
00:57:31,942 --> 00:57:33,900
Let's hope we can pin point
the root of the problem

1166
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:36,483
and deal with it before
Nationals next week.

1167
00:57:40,483 --> 00:57:42,900
[NAGISA]
Whoa! What is this?

1168
00:57:42,983 --> 00:57:44,108
Remember?

1169
00:57:44,192 --> 00:57:45,233
Haruka carved it out
of wood to get people

1170
00:57:45,317 --> 00:57:47,067
to join Swim Club last year.

1171
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:49,692
Pretty impressive
craftsmanship, if you ask me.

1172
00:57:49,775 --> 00:57:51,900
I remember, I just can't
believe you kept it!

1173
00:57:51,983 --> 00:57:53,400
Yeah.

1174
00:57:53,483 --> 00:57:55,650
[NAGISA] I wonder if we'll get
any new members next year.

1175
00:57:55,733 --> 00:57:57,858
I don't think we'll have
to worry about it too much.

1176
00:57:57,942 --> 00:57:59,275
Now that we've made
it to Nationals,

1177
00:57:59,358 --> 00:58:01,733
everyone and their
grandmother'll wanna join.

1178
00:58:01,817 --> 00:58:03,150
We'll have to turn people away.

1179
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:05,942
They'll be coming out
in droves, I guarantee it!

1180
00:58:06,025 --> 00:58:09,692
But, after Nationals,
Makoto and Haru

1181
00:58:09,775 --> 00:58:11,233
will be moving on.

1182
00:58:11,317 --> 00:58:13,733
It'll just be the
two of us for a bit.

1183
00:58:16,483 --> 00:58:18,733
[NAGISA]
I wonder what Haru is gonna do.

1184
00:58:18,817 --> 00:58:20,775
[REI]
Hey, Nagisa.

1185
00:58:20,858 --> 00:58:22,358
What do you want for Haru?

1186
00:58:22,442 --> 00:58:25,942
If you could choose his future,
what would you wish for?

1187
00:58:26,025 --> 00:58:27,858
Well, I imagine
the same as you.

1188
00:58:27,942 --> 00:58:30,358
I want him to be himself,
but more than anything,

1189
00:58:30,442 --> 00:58:32,358
happy with his choices.

1190
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:33,608
I don't know.

1191
00:58:33,692 --> 00:58:36,025
It makes me sad to see
him struggle like this.

1192
00:58:36,108 --> 00:58:37,983
I feel the same way.

1193
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,733
This is the last
tournament the four of us

1194
00:58:41,817 --> 00:58:43,108
will ever swim together.

1195
00:58:43,192 --> 00:58:45,400
I wanna be certain
Haruka's in a good place.

1196
00:58:45,483 --> 00:58:48,817
Maybe we should
say something to him.

1197
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,317
We're his friends.

1198
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,817
We have to let him
know how we feel.

1199
00:59:05,067 --> 00:59:06,358
[REI, NAGISA]
Wow.

1200
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:08,025
My, this is beautiful.

1201
00:59:08,108 --> 00:59:09,275
Yep.

1202
00:59:12,983 --> 00:59:14,400
Hey, Haruka.

1203
00:59:14,483 --> 00:59:15,858
What is it?

1204
00:59:15,942 --> 00:59:18,233
There's something we need
to talk about as a team.

1205
00:59:18,317 --> 00:59:19,775
And we need to do it
now before we swim

1206
00:59:19,858 --> 00:59:21,400
in the National Tournament.

1207
00:59:21,483 --> 00:59:23,942
Because, if we don't,
then I don't think

1208
00:59:24,025 --> 00:59:25,817
we have a chance of winning.

1209
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,233
[REI]
Haruka, listen.

1210
00:59:27,317 --> 00:59:28,942
You're an incredible swimmer.

1211
00:59:29,025 --> 00:59:30,983
Nagisa and I agree that
you're the best freestyler

1212
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:32,192
we've ever seen.

1213
00:59:32,275 --> 00:59:33,733
But now that you're
not swimming freestyle,

1214
00:59:33,817 --> 00:59:36,108
something has changed,
and not for the better.

1215
00:59:36,192 --> 00:59:38,900
Simply put, you're
not yourself anymore.

1216
00:59:38,983 --> 00:59:42,150
Truth is, we just want you to
compete at the next level.

1217
00:59:42,233 --> 00:59:44,483
To swim in front of people
from all over the country.

1218
00:59:44,567 --> 00:59:48,233
'Cause the world should
know how amazing you are.

1219
00:59:48,317 --> 00:59:49,692
Don't you see?

1220
00:59:49,775 --> 00:59:51,358
You have the power
to inspire people

1221
00:59:51,442 --> 00:59:53,650
to pursue dreams of their own.

1222
00:59:54,733 --> 00:59:56,567
[REI] Make no mistake,
when the world sees talent,

1223
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:59,608
it's moved. Exactly as
we were the first time

1224
00:59:59,692 --> 01:00:01,233
we watched you swim.

1225
01:00:01,317 --> 01:00:03,942
People all over will aspire
to reach your level.

1226
01:00:04,025 --> 01:00:07,525
Is there anything more
beautiful than inspiring others?

1227
01:00:07,608 --> 01:00:10,275
Haru, they've got a point.

1228
01:00:13,233 --> 01:00:15,442
I wish I could see
what you mean.

1229
01:00:20,442 --> 01:00:21,650
[NAGISA]
Will he be okay?

1230
01:00:21,733 --> 01:00:23,692
I sure hope so, Nagisa.

1231
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:36,525
I thought I might find you here.

1232
01:00:39,775 --> 01:00:42,900
Haru. Listen to me.

1233
01:00:42,983 --> 01:00:46,775
You can't keep
goin' on like this.

1234
01:00:46,858 --> 01:00:48,525
Till now, I've always figured,

1235
01:00:48,608 --> 01:00:51,733
"if he says he's okay, then
that's the way things are."

1236
01:00:51,817 --> 01:00:53,817
I ignored what Rin said.

1237
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:57,317
I wanted to be considerate
of you and your feelings.

1238
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,692
But then, I overheard
something you said to him

1239
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:01,608
in the locker room at Regionals.

1240
01:01:01,692 --> 01:01:04,775
[HARUKA] What "future?"
What is it you think I have?

1241
01:01:04,858 --> 01:01:06,650
This is my life, not yours!

1242
01:01:06,733 --> 01:01:09,358
I'm not you! I'm never
going to be you!

1243
01:01:09,442 --> 01:01:10,858
This is your life.

1244

is for me to stay out of it,

find your dream,

that's different.

I only want you to know that
I'm here to help you find it.

You're here to
"help me find it?"

1252
01:01:30,567 --> 01:01:32,317
You can find it just by looking?

Is that how simple
a dream really is?

You wanna find your dream,

So stop bein' a coward, already!

All you have to do is go out
into the world and find it.

You have enough
talent to do that!

So why do you keep
pushing us all away?

--[RUSSELL] Oh, yeah. Haru.
--is that him over there?

1399
01:08:51,608 --> 01:08:53,067
[RIN]
That's him.

1400
01:08:53,150 --> 01:08:54,150
C'mon, man!

1401
01:08:54,233 --> 01:08:55,817
Don't be rude. Say hello.

1402
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:57,817
Haru, this is my
home-stay family.

1403
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,025
Meet Russell and Lori!

1404
01:09:00,108 --> 01:09:03,358
[LORI] Help yourself. 'S not
rude to stuff your face here.

1405
01:09:05,317 --> 01:09:06,858
Thanks, it looks great.

1406
01:09:06,942 --> 01:09:09,483
Rin, your friend is just
as you described him.

1407
01:09:09,567 --> 01:09:12,608
Cool as a cucumber and eyes
that look like the ocean.

1408
01:09:12,692 --> 01:09:13,858
Don't embarrass him.

1409
01:09:13,942 --> 01:09:15,400
Chill out. Don't get a big head.

1410
01:09:15,483 --> 01:09:17,442
I was just trying to paint
a picture of home.

1411
01:09:17,525 --> 01:09:19,692
[RUSSELL] Rin tells us
your thing is freestyle.

1412
01:09:21,233 --> 01:09:22,567
That true?

1413
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:25,150
Nothin' else do it for ya? Wow.

1414
01:09:25,233 --> 01:09:27,358
Yeah. Well, you know.

1415
01:09:27,442 --> 01:09:29,233
[HARUKA] Did you tell these
people my whole life story,

1416
01:09:29,317 --> 01:09:30,275
or what?

1417
01:09:30,358 --> 01:09:31,650
Uh, not really?

1418
01:09:31,733 --> 01:09:34,150
I don't know if you're aware
of this or not, Haru,

1419
01:09:34,233 --> 01:09:35,900
but by the way Rin
talked, I could tell

1420
01:09:35,983 --> 01:09:38,567
you're someone he
truly looks up to.

1421
01:09:38,650 --> 01:09:40,317
Can we change the topic, please?

1422
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,817
Screw that. I wanna
know what you said.

1423
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,317
Is it really that important?

1424
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,900
Little bit, yeah.

1425
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:49,608
Ugh. What do you want from me?

1426
01:09:49,692 --> 01:09:52,150
I told you this afternoon.

1427
01:09:52,233 --> 01:09:55,983
[RUSSELL] So, mate, got
a girlfriend back home?

1428
01:09:56,067 --> 01:09:58,108
[RIN]
Long story. Or not, actually.

1429
01:09:58,192 --> 01:10:02,192
[RUSSELL laughs]
I'll take that as a no.

1430
01:10:02,275 --> 01:10:04,358
It's all right,
I was late bloomer, too.

1431
01:10:04,442 --> 01:10:06,483
[LORI chuckles]
Remember that little girl...

1432
01:10:06,567 --> 01:10:09,400
[RIN] Oh, don't go there, Lori.
Please. No, no, no.

1433
01:10:09,483 --> 01:10:11,150
[RUSSELL laughs]

1434
01:10:11,233 --> 01:10:13,275
[RUSSELL] It's summer back home
for you right now, yeah?

1435
01:10:13,358 --> 01:10:14,775
[LORI]
Does it get very hot over there?

1436
01:10:14,858 --> 01:10:17,275
[RIN]
Ugh. It's like a blast furnace.

1437
01:10:20,608 --> 01:10:22,275
Well, mates. Take care.

1438
01:10:22,358 --> 01:10:24,317
Lori and I had a
great time seein' ya.

1439
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,567
Be well. Come back and
visit whenever ya like.

1440
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:27,733
I'll keep in touch, all right?

1441
01:10:27,817 --> 01:10:29,025
Hey, and enjoy the posh digs.

1442
01:10:29,108 --> 01:10:31,817
Thanks, guys.
This was really great.

1443
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:33,233
Till next time!

1444
01:10:39,025 --> 01:10:40,317
Got something on your mind?

1445
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,775
Do what? No. No I'm good.

1446
01:10:42,858 --> 01:10:45,067
[RIN]
Cool. Let's get checked in.

1447
01:11:01,108 --> 01:11:02,317
[RIN]
What?!

1448
01:11:03,483 --> 01:11:06,567
There had better be
a cot, damn it.

1449
01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:09,567
Uh, did we get screwed or
is this normal for Australia?

1450
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:12,442
[RIN]
We got screwed! I blame you.

1451
01:11:12,525 --> 01:11:15,067
You and that stupid
girl-sounding name.

1452
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:16,942
What about yours, "sweetheart"?

1453
01:11:17,025 --> 01:11:19,192
Huh? Shut your face!

1454
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,067
Make me!

1455
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:20,942
Shut up!

1456
01:11:21,025 --> 01:11:22,108
Make me!

1457
01:11:22,192 --> 01:11:23,817
Your name confuses--
Ugh, you know what?

1458
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:26,400
Never mind. I don't
have time for this crap.

1459
01:11:26,483 --> 01:11:28,358
I'm gonna talk
to the front desk.

1460
01:11:33,025 --> 01:11:34,567
Unbelievable.

1461
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:37,817
[HARUKA] Would you stop.
Just go to sleep.

1462
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:41,358
[groans] Good night, I guess.

1463
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:56,442
[RIN]
Hey, Haru?

1464
01:11:56,525 --> 01:12:01,108
What I told Lori and Russell
back in the day was true.

1465
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:03,358
You probably don't remember
the first time we met,

1466
01:12:03,442 --> 01:12:06,400
but to me, it might as well
have been yesterday.

1467
01:12:06,483 --> 01:12:08,025
It's that vivid.

1468
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:12,567
[RIN] At that point in my life,
it never occurred to me

1469
01:12:12,650 --> 01:12:15,192
that someone could
be faster than I was.

1470
01:12:17,442 --> 01:12:19,025
[RIN]
I was pissed off at first, sure.

1471
01:12:19,108 --> 01:12:21,483
But then I thought, "Wow.
There's someone out there

1472
01:12:21,567 --> 01:12:25,817
who can teach me somethin'.
I wanna swim like this guy."

1473
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:28,942
[RIN] That's why, when you're
not out there ahead of me

1474
01:12:29,025 --> 01:12:31,692
blazin' a trail,
I feel kinda lost,

1475
01:12:31,775 --> 01:12:33,983
like I can't get my bearings.

1476
01:12:34,067 --> 01:12:37,108
It's 'cause of you that
I found out who I really was.

1477
01:12:38,608 --> 01:12:42,275
[HARUKA] I do remember.
That's was a crazy tournament.

1478
01:12:44,317 --> 01:12:46,358
What about that
last freestyle race?

1479
01:12:46,442 --> 01:12:48,192
Back in the spring?

1480
01:12:48,275 --> 01:12:51,483
Felt pretty good settin'
a new record together.

1481
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:52,858
Sure.

1482
01:12:54,442 --> 01:12:58,733
[RIN] Don't take this the wrong
way, but I was testing you.

1483
01:12:58,817 --> 01:13:00,317
Felt like I had to.

1484
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,900
I needed to see how
far you could go.

1485
01:13:04,567 --> 01:13:06,858
[RIN] Man, when I felt
you closin' the gap

1486
01:13:06,942 --> 01:13:08,192
between us, I knew.

1487
01:13:08,275 --> 01:13:10,483
There was no doubt in my mind.

1488
01:13:10,567 --> 01:13:12,233
You were in the
same league as me.

1489
01:13:12,317 --> 01:13:15,233
Post graduation, the world
would be our oyster.

1490
01:13:15,317 --> 01:13:18,025
C'mon. You can't tell me
you didn't feel it, too.

1491
01:13:18,108 --> 01:13:20,358
The future was wide open.

1492
01:13:42,608 --> 01:13:44,400
[RIN] I know you think all
your dreams are basically

1493
01:13:44,483 --> 01:13:46,900
somebody else's.
But here's the question:

1494
01:13:46,983 --> 01:13:50,025
what makes a dream really
and truly yours?

1495
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:25,733
Well, here we are.

1496
01:14:25,817 --> 01:14:27,108
[HARUKA]
What is this?

1497
01:14:27,192 --> 01:14:30,192
[RIN] A place that separates
the men from the boys.

1498
01:14:30,275 --> 01:14:31,608
Let's do it.

1499
01:14:39,733 --> 01:14:41,442
[RIN]
Yo. Over here.

1500
01:14:44,442 --> 01:14:45,733
[RIN]
Take it in.

1501
01:14:45,817 --> 01:14:47,317
This is where the best
swimmers in the world

1502
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,275
test their metal
against each other.

1503
01:14:49,358 --> 01:14:52,358
This is what I flew you
all the way here to see.

1504
01:14:54,358 --> 01:14:56,108
[RIN]
Well, not just see.

1505
01:14:56,192 --> 01:14:57,608
It's cool for us to swim?

1506
01:14:57,692 --> 01:15:00,650
As long as you got the heart.
It's anybody's lap pool.

1507
01:15:00,733 --> 01:15:02,733
Um, I didn't bring a swimsuit.

1508
01:15:02,817 --> 01:15:05,442
I got ya covered. Come on.

1509
01:15:15,858 --> 01:15:17,400
[RIN]
Hey, it's the National Team!

1510
01:15:17,483 --> 01:15:19,067
[HARUKA]
No kidding?

1511
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:20,733
[RIN] Yeah, this is
where they practice.

1512
01:15:20,817 --> 01:15:22,775
You really sure it's okay
for us to be here?

1513
01:15:22,858 --> 01:15:25,983
I... I mean, no one
else is in the pool.

1514
01:15:26,067 --> 01:15:28,567
Well, there's this one and
the practice pool over there.

1515
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:30,650
No problem usin' it if you
don't feel comfortable

1516
01:15:30,733 --> 01:15:33,650
swimmin' next to
the National Team.

1517
01:15:33,733 --> 01:15:35,233
Your call, mate.

1518
01:15:47,233 --> 01:15:50,733
[footsteps]

1519
01:15:56,025 --> 01:15:57,442
Hey. Hello.

1520
01:15:58,983 --> 01:16:02,983
[SWIMMER 12B]
Wanna race? Then let's go!

1521
01:16:03,067 --> 01:16:08,025
[CROWD cheering]

1522
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:18,233
[HARUKA gasps]

1523
01:16:20,858 --> 01:16:22,275
[HARUKA]
This is it.

1524
01:16:35,983 --> 01:16:37,733
[HARUKA]
This is what I want.

1525
01:16:37,817 --> 01:16:39,192
Right here.

1526
01:16:40,775 --> 01:16:42,650
[HARUKA]
This is my dream.

1527
01:16:47,275 --> 01:16:48,942
[RIN]
Hey.

1528
01:16:49,025 --> 01:16:51,442
You wanna watch
or you wanna swim?

1529
01:16:56,650 --> 01:16:58,150
[HARUKA]
Swim.

1530
01:17:04,942 --> 01:17:06,067
[MAKOTO]
Haru! Rin!

1531
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:07,442
[RIN]
Hey, Makoto!

1532
01:17:07,525 --> 01:17:10,275
Long way to come just
to see us get off the plane.

1533
01:17:10,358 --> 01:17:12,525
Bet you guys are pretty
wiped out from the trip.

1534
01:17:12,608 --> 01:17:15,317
Uh... Ah-- Uh...

1535
01:17:16,608 --> 01:17:19,567
[MAKOTO]
Haru.

1536
01:17:19,650 --> 01:17:21,608
It's good to see you.

1537
01:17:21,692 --> 01:17:23,317
[gasps]

1538
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,275
Good to see you, too.

1539
01:17:31,025 --> 01:17:34,400
So, uh... What do ya
say we get goin'?

1540
01:17:41,317 --> 01:17:42,525
So, ya think we're
finally gettin'

1541
01:17:42,608 --> 01:17:44,025
our heads around
this pool, or what?

1542
01:17:44,108 --> 01:17:45,442
Yeah.

1543
01:17:45,525 --> 01:17:47,358
And just imagine two days
from now when these stands

1544
01:17:47,442 --> 01:17:49,483
will be filled with spectators!

1545
01:17:49,567 --> 01:17:51,233
Sounds like someone's
gettin' nervous.

1546
01:17:51,317 --> 01:17:52,817
Oh, please.

1547
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:54,817
No, it just happens to be a day
we've all worked very hard for.

1548
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:57,400
I'm as far from nervous
as it's possible to be!

1549
01:17:57,483 --> 01:17:59,650
Ah! So you've finally grown
some hair on your chest!

1550
01:17:59,733 --> 01:18:02,108
No, but what does that
have to do with anything?

1551
01:18:02,192 --> 01:18:05,192
Uh-- Makoto will be back
with them any minute now.

1552
01:18:05,275 --> 01:18:08,400
[NAGISA] Whoa. Guess we
lost track of time.

1553
01:18:08,483 --> 01:18:09,817
C'mon, Rei.

1554
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:11,358
I can't help but wonder.

1555
01:18:11,442 --> 01:18:13,983
Do you really think the trip
had a positive effect on Haru?

1556
01:18:14,067 --> 01:18:15,483
[NAGISA]
Sure it did!

1557
01:18:15,567 --> 01:18:18,192
He just needed a little change
of scenery, that's all.

1558
01:18:18,275 --> 01:18:19,525
You'll see!

1559
01:18:20,567 --> 01:18:21,692
[REI]
Right!

1560
01:18:22,942 --> 01:18:24,108

1561
01:18:24,192 --> 01:18:25,733
Thought it'd be good to
get to know the space.

1562
01:18:25,817 --> 01:18:27,942
You know, since
tomorrow's the big day.

1563
01:18:34,275 --> 01:18:36,775
Well, I'm gonna go meet
up with my team, so...

1564
01:18:36,858 --> 01:18:38,233
See ya 'round.

1565
01:18:39,733 --> 01:18:40,733
[HARUKA]
Rin!

1566
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:43,567
Thanks a lot, man.

1567
01:18:46,650 --> 01:18:47,692
Sure.

1568
01:18:50,608 --> 01:18:52,650
[MAKOTO]
Hey!

1569
01:18:52,733 --> 01:18:53,942
[NAGISA]
Haru!

1570
01:18:54,025 --> 01:18:55,608
Welcome back!

1571
01:18:55,692 --> 01:18:57,233
Hi, Rei. Nagisa.

1572
01:18:57,317 --> 01:18:58,608
Hope the trip was cool!

1573
01:18:58,692 --> 01:18:59,983
Glad you made it home!

1574
01:19:00,067 --> 01:19:02,275
And, more importantly,
that you made it home safe.

1575
01:19:02,358 --> 01:19:04,233
[NAGISA]
You're such a mother hen, Rei.

1576
01:19:04,317 --> 01:19:06,192
He was super stressed out
about you the whole time.

1577
01:19:06,275 --> 01:19:07,900
[REI]
Shut up!

1578
01:19:07,983 --> 01:19:10,608
I'm sorry I made you
guys worry about me.

1579
01:19:11,775 --> 01:19:12,942
No biggie.

1580
01:19:13,025 --> 01:19:14,858
Just do us all a favor
and get plenty of rest

1581
01:19:14,942 --> 01:19:17,733
before the big tournament.
It is only two days away.

1582
01:19:17,817 --> 01:19:20,483
Of course, we still need to
make a few minor adjustments.

1583
01:19:20,567 --> 01:19:21,650
[NAGISA]
That's true.

1584
01:19:21,733 --> 01:19:23,317
[HARUKA]
Makoto.

1585
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,983
Nagisa, Rei.

1586
01:19:26,067 --> 01:19:29,067
We need to talk. It's important.

1587
01:19:31,942 --> 01:19:34,358
[HARUKA] Till now, I was
never really concerned

1588
01:19:34,442 --> 01:19:36,442
about winning or
losing, you know?

1589
01:19:36,525 --> 01:19:39,317
I just swam 'cause I wanted to.

1590
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,275
I thought if I made it
about tweaking my speed,

1591
01:19:41,358 --> 01:19:45,358
or beating the other team or
whatever, what'd be the point?

1592
01:19:45,442 --> 01:19:48,233
Rin wants to swim at
the international level.

1593
01:19:48,317 --> 01:19:52,192
He's diving into that world
head first after we graduate.

1594
01:19:52,275 --> 01:19:53,858
But, that's his thing.

1595
01:19:53,942 --> 01:19:55,817
Should I follow his
example if I just wanna

1596
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:58,942
keep swimming, or is
that a compromise?

1597
01:19:59,025 --> 01:20:01,317
Is it for me to care
about winning?

1598
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:04,983
I don't think so. I'm not Rin.

1599
01:20:05,067 --> 01:20:08,067
I don't have the
competitive streak he does.

1600
01:20:11,650 --> 01:20:13,858
[HARUKA]
So, that's why I couldn't answer

1601
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:16,942
when you asked what my plan was.

1602
01:20:17,025 --> 01:20:18,650
I didn't have a clue.

1603
01:20:18,733 --> 01:20:22,358
Didn't think a dream was
something you could just grab.

1604
01:20:22,442 --> 01:20:25,192
But then, Rin took
me to Australia,

1605
01:20:25,275 --> 01:20:27,608
showed me all
this amazing stuff.

1606
01:20:27,692 --> 01:20:31,067
And suddenly,
it was like, I dunno.

1607
01:20:31,150 --> 01:20:34,900
[RIN] What makes a dream
really and truly yours?

1608
01:20:34,983 --> 01:20:38,317
[HARUKA] I felt it, like
the world got a lot bigger.

1609
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,942
And me? I'd found
my place in it.

1610
01:20:44,858 --> 01:20:47,608
I wanna swim for
the rest of my life.

1611
01:20:47,692 --> 01:20:50,025
And if that means I gotta
start caring about times

1612
01:20:50,108 --> 01:20:53,233
and tournaments and all the
things that come with it,

1613
01:20:53,317 --> 01:20:55,817
that's fine with me.

1614
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:57,608
Wow, that's quite a
change of heart for you.

1615
01:20:57,692 --> 01:21:00,317
It sounds like the trip with
Rin was a real eye opener.

1616
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:01,942
I knew it was gonna work out!

1617
01:21:02,025 --> 01:21:04,025
If you've found your path,
then far be it from us

1618
01:21:04,108 --> 01:21:05,733
to give you anything
but support.

1619
01:21:05,817 --> 01:21:09,358
You better believe we'll be
cheering you on all the way!

1620
01:21:09,442 --> 01:21:10,983
I know you will.

1621
01:21:13,733 --> 01:21:15,733
[MAKOTO]
We're here. Do you believe it?

1622
01:21:15,817 --> 01:21:18,067
It still feels like a dream.

1623
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:19,400
Makoto, I--

1624
01:21:20,942 --> 01:21:24,692
[HARUKA] The other day, I said
some really stupid things.

1625
01:21:24,775 --> 01:21:26,692
I didn't mean any of 'em.

1626
01:21:28,983 --> 01:21:30,525
I'm sorry.

1627
01:21:30,608 --> 01:21:32,983
[gasps] Haru.

1628
01:21:36,858 --> 01:21:38,900
If anybody's sorry, it's me.

1629
01:21:38,983 --> 01:21:40,108
We've been through a lot.

1630
01:21:40,192 --> 01:21:43,025
I oughta be able
to talk to my friend.

1631
01:21:43,108 --> 01:21:44,525
Seriously.

1632
01:21:44,608 --> 01:21:47,525
I should've told you what
my plans were before I did.

1633
01:21:47,608 --> 01:21:50,192
Truth is, competition
isn't my thing.

1634
01:21:50,275 --> 01:21:51,608
I'd been thinking about
just fallin' back

1635
01:21:51,692 --> 01:21:54,108
on community college
or somethin'.

1636
01:21:54,192 --> 01:21:56,692
Didn't know how to bring it up.

1637
01:21:56,775 --> 01:22:00,817
Sucks when you don't know what
you wanna do with your life.

1638
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:03,483
Then Coach Sasabe
gave me that job

1639
01:22:03,567 --> 01:22:05,608
coaching little
kids at the club.

1640
01:22:05,692 --> 01:22:08,733
It was nothing special at first,
just helpin' him out and stuff.

1641
01:22:08,817 --> 01:22:11,692
I figured it was the least I
could do to repay him, ya know?

1642
01:22:11,775 --> 01:22:14,025
Then the kids
changed all of that.

1643
01:22:14,108 --> 01:22:16,650
I met Hayato,
and for some reason,

1644
01:22:16,733 --> 01:22:19,692
I really wanted to help
him learn to swim.

1645
01:22:19,775 --> 01:22:21,275
I was clueless at first.

1646
01:22:21,358 --> 01:22:23,942
But your advice actually made
more difference than you think.

1647
01:22:24,025 --> 01:22:25,442
Not like it was that profound.

1648
01:22:25,525 --> 01:22:26,983
[MAKOTO chuckles]

1649
01:22:27,067 --> 01:22:29,858
[MAKOTO] Well, the kid learned
how to do the backstroke.

1650
01:22:29,942 --> 01:22:31,775
And the look on his
face when he did--

1651
01:22:31,858 --> 01:22:34,733
I'd never seen anything
like it before in my life.

1652
01:22:34,817 --> 01:22:38,108
He was so proud of himself.

1653
01:22:38,192 --> 01:22:39,775
From that moment, I was hooked.

1654
01:22:39,858 --> 01:22:41,650
That's when I knew I
wanted to help kids feel

1655
01:22:41,733 --> 01:22:45,442
a sense of accomplishment,
take pride in themselves.

1656
01:22:48,358 --> 01:22:49,692
[MAKOTO]
I was put on this earth to bring

1657
01:22:49,775 --> 01:22:51,775
first timers to the water.

1658
01:22:51,858 --> 01:22:54,067
After graduation, I'm gonna
go to college in Tokyo

1659
01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:55,400
to make it happen.

1660
01:22:55,483 --> 01:22:56,817
That's my dream.

1661
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:58,858
That's what I'm reaching for.

1662
01:23:00,983 --> 01:23:02,275
Not bad.

1663
01:23:02,358 --> 01:23:05,275
You do realize you're gonna
be awesome at it, right?

1664
01:23:05,358 --> 01:23:07,233
You really think so?

1665

Thanks. It'll be the hardest
thing I've ever done.

01:28:11,525 --> 01:28:13,942
Hope you guys had as much
fun today as I did.

1707
01:28:14,025 --> 01:28:15,275
I did, for sure!

1708
01:28:15,358 --> 01:28:17,358
I have to admit I'm rather
proud of myself, too.

1709
01:28:17,442 --> 01:28:20,483
I've just swum a relay with
incredibly talented people.

1710
01:28:20,567 --> 01:28:22,192
Thank you all for
swimming with me.

1711
01:28:22,275 --> 01:28:24,692
Welcome, and thank you, as well.

1712
01:28:24,775 --> 01:28:27,942
So, um, do you think this
is really the end for us?

1713
01:28:28,025 --> 01:28:29,608
Come on, Nagisa,
don't look so sad.

1714
01:28:29,692 --> 01:28:30,942
It's not the end.

1715
01:28:31,025 --> 01:28:33,192
We've still got plenty of
time before graduation.

1716
01:28:33,275 --> 01:28:35,358
Oh, yeah, that's true.

1717
01:28:36,858 --> 01:28:38,942
[HARUKA]
Nagisa.

1718
01:28:39,025 --> 01:28:41,483
I'm glad you asked Makoto
and me to join Swim Club.

1719
01:28:41,567 --> 01:28:43,442
So, um. Thank you.

1720
01:28:43,525 --> 01:28:45,275
[laughs]

1721
01:28:46,317 --> 01:28:47,817
And, Rei, you should
be proud of yourself

1722
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:49,067
for how far you've come.

1723
01:28:49,150 --> 01:28:50,733
Thank you, Haruka.

1724
01:28:50,817 --> 01:28:52,567
Also, even though this is over,

1725
01:28:52,650 --> 01:28:55,317
I know that we'll
always be friends.

1726
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:57,858
I'll be counting on you
from now on, too.

1727
01:28:57,942 --> 01:28:59,275
Okay.

1728
01:29:00,358 --> 01:29:01,608
[HARUKA]
Makoto.

1729
01:29:01,692 --> 01:29:03,692
You've always been such
great support for us,

1730
01:29:03,775 --> 01:29:07,025
and it's been appreciated.

1731
01:29:08,067 --> 01:29:09,483
You're welcome, Haru.

1732
01:29:12,650 --> 01:29:13,900
[MAKOTO chuckles]

1733
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,900
[BOTH laugh]

1734
01:29:25,233 --> 01:29:27,650
[ALL laugh]

1735
01:29:27,733 --> 01:29:30,150
[ALL]
Thank you, everyone!

1736
01:29:30,233 --> 01:29:32,650
Hey, you guys, check out
the clouds right now!

1737
01:29:32,733 --> 01:29:33,733
[MAKOTO]
Wow!

1738
01:29:33,817 --> 01:29:35,775
They look like wings!
That's so cool!

1739
01:29:35,858 --> 01:29:37,275
[laughs]

1740
01:29:37,358 --> 01:29:38,817
[REI]
It's beautiful.

1741
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:40,525
[NAGISA] You know what? We need
to take a picture together!

1742
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:41,775
[REI]
Nagisa, slow down!

1743
01:29:41,858 --> 01:29:43,650
Running like that
is very dangerous!

1744
01:29:43,733 --> 01:29:45,567
[NAGISA]
Don't be such a baby. Come on!

1745
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:47,067
[MAKOTO]
Okay. Haru, you ready?

1746
01:32:50,942 --> 01:32:53,567
[SOSUKE]
Great, where am I?

1747
01:32:58,817 --> 01:33:00,817
[RIN]
Hey, where'd Sosuke run off to?

1748
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:03,775
[UOZUMI] He went to get
something not too long ago.

1749
01:33:03,858 --> 01:33:06,900
Let me take a wild guess
and assume he got lost again?

1750
01:33:06,983 --> 01:33:09,067
Don't worry, sir.
I'll go look for him!

1751
01:33:15,483 --> 01:33:16,650
--[GIRL B] Come on!
--[BOY B] Go, Ikuya!

1752
01:33:16,733 --> 01:33:17,442
--Move it! Go!

1753
01:33:17,525 --> 01:33:18,942
You can do it, Kirishima!

1754
01:33:19,025 --> 01:33:20,692
[BOY A]
Go, Ikuya!

1755
01:33:31,067 --> 01:33:33,817
[SOSUKE]
Whoa. What's he doing here?

1756
01:33:41,692 --> 01:33:44,108
[NATSUYA]
Really? Good job.

1757
01:33:44,192 --> 01:33:46,942
How was your time? Think
you're hitting a plateau?

1758
01:33:47,025 --> 01:33:49,150
[IKUYA]
No. I'm good.

1759
01:33:49,233 --> 01:33:50,692
Really good, in fact.

1760
01:33:50,775 --> 01:33:53,233
My strokes have been
lengthening, too.

1761
01:33:53,317 --> 01:33:56,192
It's almost scary how little
I feel like I'm plateauing.

1762
01:33:56,275 --> 01:33:59,192
[NATSUYA laughs]
That's what I like to hear.

1763
01:33:59,275 --> 01:34:01,067
But Kinjo from
Suda-East and Terashima

1764
01:34:01,150 --> 01:34:05,275
from Oomori Academy are also
getting faster, aren't they?

1765
01:34:05,358 --> 01:34:07,942
Wasn't it a tough race?

1766
01:34:08,025 --> 01:34:10,108
[IKUYA]
I appreciate your concern.

1767
01:34:10,192 --> 01:34:14,358
However, I'm not
gonna lose to anyone.

1768
01:34:26,692 --> 01:34:29,108
[RIN]
Hey, Sosuke, I got a question.

1769
01:34:29,192 --> 01:34:30,567
Do you remember
that summer we met

1770
01:34:30,650 --> 01:34:32,983
and raced against each other?

1771
01:34:33,067 --> 01:34:35,442
[SOSUKE] I couldn't forget
it if I wanted to.

1772
01:34:35,525 --> 01:34:38,692
You know our match from
that day isn't over, Rin.

1773
01:34:38,775 --> 01:34:40,983
[RIN] Looks like this
summer's gonna be hot.

1774
01:34:41,067 --> 01:34:44,025
[SOSUKE] Yeah, let's make
it a really hot one.

1775
01:34:44,108 --> 01:34:47,650
[RIN] Next time: <i>Free!</i>
<i>Timeless Medley: The Promise</i> .

1776
01:34:47,733 --> 01:34:50,900
[SOSUKE] The seasons change,
and so do our feelings.

1777
01:34:50,983 --> 01:34:54,983
[RIN] It's still way too soon to
get to the finish line, Sosuke.
