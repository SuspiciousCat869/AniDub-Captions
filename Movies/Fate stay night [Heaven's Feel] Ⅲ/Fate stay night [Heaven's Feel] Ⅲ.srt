1
00:00:48,104 --> 00:00:50,175
Surely you know the truth,

2
00:00:51,637 --> 00:00:54,644
who's responsible for Shinji's death.

3
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:00,825
Yes.

4
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:04,923
You're finally finished pretending you can't see.

5
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:12,110
After all it endured to grow, breaking it
down proved more troublesome than I expected.

6
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:18,152
In a perfect world, you would have
done it by personally betraying Sakura,

7
00:01:18,595 --> 00:01:21,411
but it pays to have a backup plan.

8
00:01:21,723 --> 00:01:24,003
Backup plan? He's dead.

9
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:28,029
It's a half-assed awakening
that retains its humanoid form.

10
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:33,293
Though this is quite possibly the
first time she has been worthy of praise.

11
00:01:36,252 --> 00:01:38,890
Zouken, where is Sakura?

12
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:48,770
Hey, what does it feel like, being a sister?

13
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,918
I'm not ungrateful to you, either.

14
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:16,277
Before you, that girl endured everything,

15
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:19,988
but you taught her how to desire other humans

16
00:02:20,013 --> 00:02:22,533
and gave her a reason to fight back.

17
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:25,611
Now that she's killed her older brother,

18
00:02:25,674 --> 00:02:28,435
she cannot stand still any longer.

19
00:02:28,538 --> 00:02:33,403
Next, she will claim Archer's
soul from the Einzberns' Holy Grail,

20
00:02:33,578 --> 00:02:36,871
and then she will take the key to the gate,

21
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:38,437
and it will all be over.

22
00:02:40,517 --> 00:02:41,572
Zouken!

23
00:02:57,925 --> 00:03:02,704
Now, Sakura, you shall finally accept the shadow.

24
00:03:08,357 --> 00:03:11,006
As you wish, grandfather.

25
00:03:22,863 --> 00:03:23,999
Sakura.

26
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:42,431
I wondered if you'd be here, big sister.

27
00:03:42,996 --> 00:03:46,003
Of course. I'm not like Shirou, you know.

28
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:48,392
I wouldn't run off to save you.

29
00:03:48,882 --> 00:03:50,446
And I knew you'd be back.

30
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:52,959
You were going to come back for Illya sooner or later.

31
00:03:54,937 --> 00:03:57,132
You're so mean, big sister.

32
00:03:57,636 --> 00:04:00,532
Honestly, am I that bad of a person?

33
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,701
Of course you are.

34
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:06,870
you were too weak to trust the
one person who swore to protect you,

35
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,833
so you ran away without a word like a coward.

36
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,543
You're right.

37
00:04:14,683 --> 00:04:16,590
That's the person I've always been.

38
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,905
But that's all over.

39
00:04:19,317 --> 00:04:20,857
I'm not weak anymore.

40
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,223
From here on, I'll protect Shirou.

41
00:04:26,904 --> 00:04:27,865
I'm strong.

42
00:04:28,486 --> 00:04:31,295
Nothing can stop me, not even you.

43
00:04:34,517 --> 00:04:35,882
Verschmelzen!

44
00:04:38,184 --> 00:04:39,613
I wouldn't do that.

45
00:04:42,538 --> 00:04:44,887
If you use that kind of Magecraft,

46
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,121
you'll cause the whole house to fall apart.

47
00:05:06,744 --> 00:05:07,891
Delicious.

48
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:11,462
Your magical energy's wonderful, big sister.

49
00:05:13,696 --> 00:05:14,736
Except...

50
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:18,145
it's not enough, not yet.

51
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,137
If I don't finish you,

52
00:05:21,494 --> 00:05:22,684
you'll get back up.

53
00:05:24,335 --> 00:05:27,050
Because you're a hero.

54
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:28,870
I have no choice.

55
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,175
Sakura!

56
00:05:44,952 --> 00:05:45,762
Shirou...

57
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:46,968
Why?

58
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:51,434
Sa...

59
00:05:55,587 --> 00:05:56,439
Tohsaka!

60
00:05:59,753 --> 00:06:00,840
What is this?

61
00:06:07,523 --> 00:06:10,203
Why are you rushing to protect my sister...

62
00:06:11,882 --> 00:06:13,779
without saying a word to me?

63
00:06:15,096 --> 00:06:17,002
Why aren't you scolding me?

64
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:21,761
You saw what happened to my brother, what I did.

65
00:06:22,532 --> 00:06:23,375
You're wrong.

66
00:06:23,706 --> 00:06:25,451
Zouken set you up. It wasn't...

67
00:06:25,476 --> 00:06:26,488
I killed him.

68
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:29,306
You see, Shirou, I'm crazy.

69
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:33,916
In fact, I have been since the very beginning.

70
00:06:35,006 --> 00:06:36,493
Sakura.

71
00:06:37,675 --> 00:06:39,849
Isn't it painful to be with me?

72
00:06:40,695 --> 00:06:41,859
Isn't it, Shirou?

73
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:45,168
That's why I had no choice but to get far away from you.

74
00:06:45,962 --> 00:06:47,657
But that doesn't work for me,

75
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:50,963
'cause you're the only thing that makes me happy.

76
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:52,621
I can't live without you.

77
00:06:53,607 --> 00:06:56,408
And you can't distance yourself from me, either,

78
00:06:56,802 --> 00:07:00,220
because you can't betray yourself
any more than you already have.

79
00:07:08,191 --> 00:07:10,929
Which is why I have to kill you.

80
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:13,475
Your suffering will end,

81
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,391
and you'll be by my side forever.

82
00:07:25,994 --> 00:07:29,449
This was the last order you gave me, Sakura,

83
00:07:30,461 --> 00:07:33,747
"Protect Shirou, no matter the circumstances."

84
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:38,291
Think you can stop me? Bad girl.

85
00:07:42,821 --> 00:07:45,694
Sakura, don't follow this path.

86
00:07:46,035 --> 00:07:48,070
You'll find nothing at the end,

87
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:51,582
nothing but darkness, and you'll be all alone.

88
00:07:53,462 --> 00:07:57,928
But I'm here. Follow me, and
I'll guide you back to the light.

89
00:08:16,106 --> 00:08:17,677
Sakura...

90
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:27,590
You serve no Master now.

91
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:36,300
Rider, I'm going to absorb you.

92
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,015
No, don't!

93
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,556
I have all the power I need,

94
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,905
but I'll make an exception and put you to use like Saber.

95
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:50,674
Stop it, Sakura. That's enough.

96
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:54,611
You can take me with you.

97
00:08:55,444 --> 00:08:56,119
Illya!

98
00:08:57,335 --> 00:08:59,039
Have you lost your mind?

99
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:02,922
You realize if you come with me, that I will kill you.

100
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,732
But it's useless to resist.

101
00:09:06,557 --> 00:09:09,465
I mean, you're too powerful for anyone to stop you.

102
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:13,094
I'm too...

103
00:09:14,134 --> 00:09:15,244
powerful?

104
00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:24,571
You want the last key, but it's not here.

105
00:09:24,768 --> 00:09:28,151
I'm afraid you'll have to come
back to my castle with me to get it.

106
00:09:28,817 --> 00:09:31,112
That's the only way you can open the gate.

107
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:34,365
All right, then.

108
00:09:35,134 --> 00:09:37,306
Whatever you're planning, I'll play along.

109
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,055
Shirou, please don't let me see you again.

110
00:09:53,348 --> 00:09:55,545
I'll have no choice but to kill you.

111
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,724
It's over.

112
00:10:00,364 --> 00:10:02,428
I've had a lot of fun, Big Brother.

113
00:10:03,088 --> 00:10:04,182
Goodbye now.

114
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:20,328
Please, Saber! Let me through!

115
00:10:20,832 --> 00:10:22,372
What do you think you're going to do?

116
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,617
Sakura will claim the Holy Grail

117
00:10:25,808 --> 00:10:27,173
one way or another.

118
00:10:27,998 --> 00:10:30,380
Even if she has to die in order to do it,

119
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:33,911
Sakura Matou will find salvation.

120
00:10:36,735 --> 00:10:38,327
This is your last warning.

121
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,766
If you're still stubborn enough to try to follow us,

122
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,444
I will cut off your head.

123
00:11:12,632 --> 00:11:15,465
The outcome has been decided.

124
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:23,980
Actually, I suppose it's been decided for a long time now.

125
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:27,941
This Holy Grail War was altered.

126
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,898
There should only be one Holy Grail.

127
00:11:31,981 --> 00:11:36,018
But in this place, a second Grail has already existed.

128
00:11:36,631 --> 00:11:39,895
Its vessel was deemed fit to
hold the contents of the Grail,

129
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:42,882
and thus it became one itself.

130
00:11:44,647 --> 00:11:46,328
If that vessel had been unworthy,

131
00:11:46,353 --> 00:11:49,948
surely it would have become
nothing more than a mound of flesh.

132
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:53,588
But the stage is now set,

133
00:11:53,803 --> 00:11:56,049
and soon I will have my answer.

134
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:59,096
The birth will reveal it to me.

135
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:06,668
If there are some thing that simply
can't be seen from the audience...

136
00:12:08,718 --> 00:12:13,222
well, then, I shall rise onto the stage myself.

137
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,114
Kotomine!

138
00:12:20,794 --> 00:12:21,991
It's Tohsaka.

139
00:12:22,961 --> 00:12:23,715
Help her.

140
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,816
You're awake.

141
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:21,301
Is it difficult to move?

142
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:24,969
Kotomine.

143
00:13:27,237 --> 00:13:28,411
Where's Tohsaka?

144
00:13:30,515 --> 00:13:33,625
She had been drained of all her magical energy.

145
00:13:34,435 --> 00:13:35,983
She'll be fine by tomorrow.

146
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:37,233
I buried her.

147
00:13:40,014 --> 00:13:40,864
buried?

148
00:13:41,181 --> 00:13:43,312
In the yard on the Tohsaka estate.

149
00:13:43,427 --> 00:13:44,907
The soil there is special.

150
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:48,119
Oh, okay.

151
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,371
Thanks for the help,

152
00:13:50,935 --> 00:13:52,275
but I gotta get going.

153
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,448
Care to tell me where you're headed?

154
00:13:58,633 --> 00:14:00,548
Illya let Sakura take her.

155
00:14:01,222 --> 00:14:02,801
We'd be dead if she hadn't.

156
00:14:03,722 --> 00:14:04,434
But now...

157
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:09,285
I take that to mean that Sakura
Matou has become your enemy.

158
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:21,110
Come with me.

159
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:28,165
I suspect Zouken's objective is to possess Sakura

160
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:31,162
once she becomes nothing but a hollow shell.

161
00:14:32,846 --> 00:14:35,648
Therefore, if we're going to stop that from happening,

162
00:14:36,037 --> 00:14:38,085
we must rescue Illyasviel

163
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,935
and defeat Zouken before it's too late.

164
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,491
At least for the time being, you
and I have that objective in common.

165
00:14:46,492 --> 00:14:47,983
What are you saying?

166
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:57,141
I'm saying I'll help.

167
00:14:57,569 --> 00:14:59,107
Now let's get going.

168
00:15:05,258 --> 00:15:08,149
Wait a second. What about Rider?

169
00:15:08,609 --> 00:15:09,788
Out of the question.

170
00:15:10,545 --> 00:15:13,323
Even without Command Spells, they're still connected.

171
00:15:13,966 --> 00:15:17,539
We'll have no chance if Sakura
catches on before we get there.

172
00:15:31,751 --> 00:15:35,415
...two nights since the mysterious
disappearances in Fuyuki City.

173
00:15:35,615 --> 00:15:39,433
The total number of missing persons
is still unknown, as is the cause.

174
00:15:39,798 --> 00:15:41,940
A power outage that coincided with the event,

175
00:15:41,964 --> 00:15:45,478
lasting several hours appears to have
been centered around the New City train...

176
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:48,197
You know, if it were him,

177
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,112
he wouldn't have let Sakura live
long enough for any of this to happen.

178
00:15:55,624 --> 00:15:57,304
For the sake of "justice,"

179
00:15:57,329 --> 00:16:02,017
your father felt he needed to detach
himself from all of his emotional entanglements.

180
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:06,174
I disliked Kiritsugu Emiya's way of life.

181
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:08,176
It was difficult to witness.

182
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:11,804
He abandoned everything he had since the very beginning,

183
00:16:12,193 --> 00:16:15,808
while I never had anything that
would have been worthy of sacrifice.

184
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,161
It's all the same in the end,

185
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:21,328
but the path we took to get there made a difference.

186
00:16:21,858 --> 00:16:25,732
We were so similar, and yet I despised him.

187
00:16:26,383 --> 00:16:30,002
If you're going to throw it away,
why bother with it in the first place?

188
00:16:30,613 --> 00:16:32,677
But he kept trying to hold on to it.

189
00:16:34,016 --> 00:16:36,890
Even after discarding it, he picked it back up.

190
00:16:38,271 --> 00:16:42,043
But truly, your father knew happiness.

191
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:46,297
Kiritsugu was happy?

192
00:16:46,914 --> 00:16:49,698
Love yourself. Love your neighbors.

193
00:16:49,763 --> 00:16:52,493
Forgive sins. Accept punishment.

194
00:16:52,755 --> 00:16:55,389
All the nourishment a life needs.

195
00:16:57,414 --> 00:17:00,659
The things people of your ilk call "happiness,"

196
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:03,389
they never brought me any joy.

197
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:05,748
That's all I can tell you.

198
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:13,959
Then I have a question.

199
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:16,209
Why did you save Sakura?

200
00:17:17,365 --> 00:17:19,288
Humans are meant to die,

201
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,671
but she wasn't the only thing that was dying.

202
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:26,634
Otherwise, I wouldn't have
done nearly so much to intervene.

203
00:17:28,246 --> 00:17:34,428
However, it is my role to bless the
birth of the darkness inside of Sakura Matou.

204
00:17:35,229 --> 00:17:36,556
Are you insane?

205
00:17:37,112 --> 00:17:40,104
That shadow thing, it kills people.

206
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,938
And yet it still hasn't been born.

207
00:17:44,515 --> 00:17:48,859
Were that the case, it would be assigned
sins and punished for them accordingly.

208
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,862
But it still deserves a birth.

209
00:17:52,445 --> 00:17:57,635
Or perhaps you believe the son of a criminal
is also a criminal before ever leaving the womb

210
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,501
and must therefore be aborted?

211
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:10,613
Let me pose you this question.

212
00:18:12,422 --> 00:18:14,176
When it comes to Sakura,

213
00:18:14,684 --> 00:18:18,303
you can't deny that she's quite literally a man-eater.

214
00:18:20,056 --> 00:18:24,186
Now that you know that, do you still intend to help her?

215
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:33,821
Countless people have lost their lives to her.

216
00:18:34,522 --> 00:18:37,658
Even she must be ashamed of what she has become.

217
00:18:38,222 --> 00:18:40,452
Wouldn't it be fair to assume, then,

218
00:18:40,992 --> 00:18:43,664
that she would be happier in death?

219
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:47,960
It would also grant her atonement
for the lives she's taken.

220
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,777
No, that doesn't make things better.

221
00:18:55,682 --> 00:18:56,491
Doesn't it?

222
00:18:57,988 --> 00:19:02,781
I suppose that means you won't be
following in Kiritsugu Emiya's footsteps, then.

223
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:36,517
I'll check it out.

224
00:19:44,104 --> 00:19:46,477
Beginning synchronization.

225
00:19:47,827 --> 00:19:50,803
Tracing basic structure.

226
00:19:51,676 --> 00:19:55,072
Tracing component materials.

227
00:19:58,612 --> 00:20:00,066
On the third floor...

228
00:20:01,063 --> 00:20:02,665
in the room on the left.

229
00:20:11,449 --> 00:20:12,461
Sakura.

230
00:20:14,603 --> 00:20:15,631
That's enough.

231
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,051
Don't lose sight of your priorities here.

232
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:22,772
Yeah, I know.

233
00:20:23,645 --> 00:20:25,681
Well then, Shirou Emiya...

234
00:20:27,714 --> 00:20:30,468
do you have any experience with mountain climbing?

235
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:42,739
Miss Illya, are we really going to be fully
preparing your formal attire for these people?

236
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:44,577
Did you forget?

237
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,635
We only have one purpose,

238
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,331
to make sure the Holy Grail is completed.

239
00:20:50,604 --> 00:20:52,278
As long as it's suitable,

240
00:20:52,508 --> 00:20:54,462
the vessel doesn't have to be me.

241
00:21:32,888 --> 00:21:35,817
Did you really have to throw me at the window?

242
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:40,728
You looked pathetic plastered to the wall with one arm.

243
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,704
I thought I'd speed things up a bit.

244
00:21:42,832 --> 00:21:43,758
We don't have all night.

245
00:21:43,783 --> 00:21:45,763
What are you doing here? Who are you?!

246
00:21:46,022 --> 00:21:47,117
Are you thieves?

247
00:21:47,414 --> 00:21:50,617
Oh, no, not at all! We're not bad guys!

248
00:21:51,633 --> 00:21:52,561
Shirou.

249
00:21:56,831 --> 00:21:57,393
Illya...

250
00:21:57,418 --> 00:21:58,458
Why are you here?

251
00:22:00,473 --> 00:22:01,846
You need to go home.

252
00:22:02,831 --> 00:22:05,044
There's nothing left for you to do now.

253
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:09,791
Just forget about Sakura, and leave everything to me.

254
00:22:11,132 --> 00:22:11,941
Go on.

255
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,798
This is my burden to bear.

256
00:22:17,585 --> 00:22:19,220
So stupid.

257
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,669
What is it?

258
00:22:28,861 --> 00:22:30,099
That doesn't matter.

259
00:22:33,255 --> 00:22:35,670
I don't care what you think your burden is!

260
00:22:36,013 --> 00:22:37,806
You can try to act all tough,

261
00:22:38,036 --> 00:22:39,972
you can try to pretend you're all right,

262
00:22:40,115 --> 00:22:42,202
but I won't be fooled by any of that!

263
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,067
I'm not trying to act tough!

264
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:46,956
I'm the Holy Grail, you dummy!

265
00:22:46,981 --> 00:22:49,052
That is exactly what I'm talking about!

266
00:22:49,085 --> 00:22:50,576
You are Illya!

267
00:22:52,156 --> 00:22:54,456
So don't sacrifice yourself,

268
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:57,251
not for the sake of someone else!

269
00:22:58,585 --> 00:22:59,602
You say that,

270
00:23:00,031 --> 00:23:01,356
but look who's talking.

271
00:23:12,014 --> 00:23:12,906
Let's go.

272
00:23:18,284 --> 00:23:19,788
I can't do this.

273
00:23:20,736 --> 00:23:22,885
I know it will never work.

274
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,291
As I said before, we don't have all night.

275
00:23:30,316 --> 00:23:32,496
Hold on! Stop! Put me down!

276
00:23:32,521 --> 00:23:34,496
Uh, shouldn't we...

277
00:23:35,176 --> 00:23:37,065
This castle is where we belong.

278
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:38,584
Don't worry about us.

279
00:23:39,223 --> 00:23:41,080
We entrust Illya to you.

280
00:23:49,806 --> 00:23:50,804
You okay?

281
00:23:51,767 --> 00:23:53,504
You always surprise me.

282
00:23:53,622 --> 00:23:56,941
Jumping from the third story without using Magecraft.

283
00:23:57,258 --> 00:23:58,837
Are you suicidal?

284
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:02,162
Give me a break! I thought I'd be able to pull it off.

285
00:24:05,806 --> 00:24:07,893
Archer is influencing your mind.

286
00:24:14,671 --> 00:24:16,528
You came for me after all.

287
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:18,511
Shirou.

288
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:38,764
Let's move.

289
00:24:48,311 --> 00:24:49,390
He's fast.

290
00:24:50,952 --> 00:24:53,492
But I can keep up.

291
00:24:59,793 --> 00:25:00,746
Berserker.

292
00:25:47,392 --> 00:25:49,177
I guess I was wrong about you.

293
00:25:49,232 --> 00:25:50,632
You're not just a doll.

294
00:25:56,106 --> 00:25:57,236
Take her and go.

295
00:26:00,856 --> 00:26:01,602
Emiya...

296
00:26:02,078 --> 00:26:05,439
if you decide to rescue a woman, be sure not to kill her.

297
00:26:05,975 --> 00:26:08,466
Seeing her die before your eyes,

298
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,403
it'll haunt you for the rest of your life.

299
00:26:17,673 --> 00:26:18,786
Okay, let's go.

300
00:26:28,643 --> 00:26:31,505
The White Holy Grail will not escape.

301
00:26:31,846 --> 00:26:36,179
I need her. I have a wish for it to grant as well.

302
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,258
Is he looking for me?

303
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:01,578
Shirou...

304
00:27:02,417 --> 00:27:03,872
you have to leave me.

305
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:06,201
Huh? I can't do that!

306
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:40,117
What a pleasure to see you again, Kirei.

307
00:27:40,649 --> 00:27:42,616
Zouken Matou.

308
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:44,913
Well...

309
00:27:45,879 --> 00:27:48,021
I wasn't expecting you to show up.

310
00:27:49,803 --> 00:27:51,482
You're finished.

311
00:27:51,696 --> 00:27:55,656
Do me a favor, and show him some mercy, Assassin.

312
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:06,768
It's strange that I'm reminded of it now,

313
00:28:07,505 --> 00:28:10,814
but since the moment I was born, I've had a flaw.

314
00:28:11,513 --> 00:28:14,526
For I have always found happiness in agony.

315
00:28:15,022 --> 00:28:17,571
Despair is what gives me pleasure.

316
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,199
I know what that makes me.

317
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:25,368
Any creature that lives their life in
that manner is the very definition of evil.

318
00:28:26,379 --> 00:28:28,704
It's a terrible flaw.

319
00:28:28,963 --> 00:28:32,831
But even though I knew I was
a heretic, I had common sense.

320
00:28:35,117 --> 00:28:36,632
I wanted to change

321
00:28:36,703 --> 00:28:39,176
and did everything I could to accomplish it.

322
00:28:39,545 --> 00:28:43,013
When nothing worked, I made one final attempt.

323
00:28:43,323 --> 00:28:45,057
I fell in love with a woman.

324
00:28:54,408 --> 00:28:58,955
Or more accurately, I tried to fall in love.

325
00:28:59,497 --> 00:29:01,593
We even had a child together.

326
00:29:02,543 --> 00:29:03,980
But it didn't matter.

327
00:29:06,033 --> 00:29:10,111
Try as I might, I never could love you.

328
00:29:11,861 --> 00:29:16,258
You're wrong. You love me, and I know you always have.

329
00:29:29,741 --> 00:29:31,059
Noble Phantasm...

330
00:29:32,994 --> 00:29:34,050
Zabaniya!

331
00:29:41,598 --> 00:29:43,238
It's all over.

332
00:29:51,063 --> 00:29:52,889
Impossible. You bastard!

333
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:13,387
Know this.

334
00:30:15,253 --> 00:30:17,969
I will kill. I will let live.

335
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:20,360
I will harm, and I will heal.

336
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:24,031
None shall ever be able to escape my grasp.

337
00:30:24,348 --> 00:30:27,052
None shall ever be able to escape my sight.

338
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:29,522
Damn you. Get off me!

339
00:30:29,547 --> 00:30:30,703
Be crushed.

340
00:30:30,915 --> 00:30:34,132
I welcome all who have grown old or been defeated.

341
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:39,634
Devote yourself to me, learn from me, obey me, and rest.

342
00:30:39,828 --> 00:30:42,679
Do not forget song, do not forget prayer,

343
00:30:42,711 --> 00:30:45,218
and most of all, do not forget me.

344
00:30:45,466 --> 00:30:49,437
I am light, and I shall relieve all your burdens.

345
00:30:49,736 --> 00:30:52,640
Aha! Are you going to kill me?

346
00:30:52,665 --> 00:30:55,039
Your solace is in my hands.

347
00:30:55,132 --> 00:30:58,498
I shall pour oil unto your sins, and I shall mark you.

348
00:30:59,117 --> 00:31:01,109
For it is only through death

349
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,452
that one can be granted the gift of eternal life.

350
00:31:04,889 --> 00:31:06,552
Beg forgiveness now.

351
00:31:06,608 --> 00:31:08,909
I, the reincarnation, shall absolve you.

352
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:11,395
What will that change, huh?

353
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,507
There is no salvation in you.

354
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,331
Kyrie eleison.

355
00:31:33,297 --> 00:31:38,155
Using the holy words of Scripture
to attack the spirit itself.

356
00:31:40,581 --> 00:31:42,655
My lord's only weakness.

357
00:31:43,024 --> 00:31:44,893
How did you survive?

358
00:31:46,376 --> 00:31:48,304
You were his natural enemy.

359
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:52,369
You were already corrupted, weren't you?

360
00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:58,041
That was my mistake.

361
00:32:10,863 --> 00:32:15,267
See? Look at you. You're crying.

362
00:32:17,528 --> 00:32:19,567
Don't misunderstand me.

363
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:25,448
I won't deny that I was saddened,

364
00:32:26,209 --> 00:32:29,270
but it wasn't her death that caused my tears.

365
00:32:33,992 --> 00:32:35,841
If she was going to die,

366
00:32:36,683 --> 00:32:39,916
I wanted to kill her with my own hands.

367
00:32:52,593 --> 00:32:53,323
Shirou?

368
00:32:54,426 --> 00:32:56,641
Illya, are you all right?

369
00:32:57,577 --> 00:32:58,529
Y-yes.

370
00:33:04,736 --> 00:33:06,418
You have to run. Go on.

371
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:08,902
I'm the only one Berserker's after.

372
00:33:10,002 --> 00:33:11,070
Get out of here!

373
00:33:17,751 --> 00:33:19,998
A big brother's gotta protect his sister.

374
00:33:21,465 --> 00:33:22,523
You can't...

375
00:33:23,615 --> 00:33:24,502
It's okay.

376
00:33:25,031 --> 00:33:27,282
You called me your brother, so that's what I am.

377
00:33:27,544 --> 00:33:28,548
I'll protect you.

378
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:32,893
Blood or not, you're my little sister.

379
00:33:42,885 --> 00:33:43,605
Shirou...

380
00:33:44,078 --> 00:33:45,940
you can't use Archer's arm.

381
00:33:46,202 --> 00:33:47,527
You won't come back!

382
00:33:48,273 --> 00:33:48,940
I know.

383
00:33:50,957 --> 00:33:52,186
You're going to die.

384
00:33:52,988 --> 00:33:53,773
Wrong.

385
00:33:55,678 --> 00:33:57,764
I'm using it so I stay alive.

386
00:33:59,757 --> 00:34:00,519
Why?

387
00:34:01,805 --> 00:34:04,876
Why do you always put yourself through so much suffering?!

388
00:34:05,281 --> 00:34:08,780
You have never done anything wrong! It's not fair!

389
00:34:13,463 --> 00:34:14,407
Not true.

390
00:34:14,915 --> 00:34:18,131
I've done plenty wrong, no matter what you think.

391
00:34:19,066 --> 00:34:19,747
But...

392
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,353
thank you.

393
00:34:29,461 --> 00:34:33,154
I don't know what using this
arm will do, but I have to try.

394
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:36,116
It might take away all my memories,

395
00:34:36,264 --> 00:34:38,652
the fact that I swore to protect Sakura

396
00:34:39,192 --> 00:34:43,048
or why I came here, to bring Illya back with me.

397
00:34:43,683 --> 00:34:44,666
Doesn't matter.

398
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,262
He trusted me with this for a reason,

399
00:34:47,308 --> 00:34:48,962
so I'll do what I have to.

400
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:53,564
I'm taking him down.

401
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,010
That okay?

402
00:35:18,895 --> 00:35:21,161
My mind and body crumble,

403
00:35:21,484 --> 00:35:23,072
and I feel nothing.

404
00:35:25,715 --> 00:35:27,946
I can't remember why I'm here.

405
00:35:29,938 --> 00:35:33,247
I can't remember why this is happening.

406
00:35:34,001 --> 00:35:37,244
I can't remember what I'm fighting for.

407
00:35:58,815 --> 00:36:00,325
Think you can keep up?

408
00:36:10,997 --> 00:36:13,002
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?

409
00:36:13,526 --> 00:36:14,915
Are you confused?

410
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,470
That's my question to you!

411
00:36:27,545 --> 00:36:29,558
You keep up with me!

412
00:36:47,035 --> 00:36:48,899
Trace on!

413
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:12,753
Trigger off.

414
00:37:27,077 --> 00:37:30,749
Nine Lives Blade Works!

415
00:38:36,048 --> 00:38:37,877
Protect her for me.

416
00:38:58,776 --> 00:38:59,794
Shirou.

417
00:39:09,894 --> 00:39:10,871
It's Saber.

418
00:39:23,551 --> 00:39:24,821
How does it feel,

419
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,434
someone clutching your heart in their grasp?

420
00:39:34,311 --> 00:39:35,472
Oh, I see.

421
00:39:35,917 --> 00:39:38,050
It seems you died ten years ago.

422
00:39:38,931 --> 00:39:40,982
And you only came back because of...

423
00:39:41,763 --> 00:39:45,133
Uh, I ate him the other day.

424
00:39:45,735 --> 00:39:49,339
The man in gold he was showered
with the contents of the Holy Grail.

425
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:52,495
But because he couldn't be corrupted by it,

426
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,810
all his dark energy flowed into you, his Master.

427
00:39:56,176 --> 00:39:57,262
Isn't that right?

428
00:39:58,681 --> 00:40:01,917
Seems you've changed, Sakura Matou.

429
00:40:03,078 --> 00:40:05,506
Yes, I certainly have.

430
00:40:06,443 --> 00:40:07,795
I've changed a lot.

431
00:40:07,968 --> 00:40:10,632
I'm not the same Sakura that I used to be.

432
00:40:11,979 --> 00:40:13,623
Now she doesn't exist.

433
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:15,538
She was far too weak.

434
00:40:19,403 --> 00:40:21,669
You don't need to hide it from me.

435
00:40:22,685 --> 00:40:24,787
What do you mean? Hide what?

436
00:40:24,812 --> 00:40:27,592
You're not some kind of alternate personality.

437
00:40:28,209 --> 00:40:31,066
The version of you intoxicated with violence

438
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,089
is still Sakura Matou.

439
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:37,894
You're the one who made me this way, priest.

440
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,669
I won't deny it.

441
00:40:41,404 --> 00:40:43,900
I had my own reasons to keep you alive.

442
00:40:44,613 --> 00:40:46,449
And just look at you now.

443
00:40:46,474 --> 00:40:48,363
You've met all my expectations,

444
00:40:48,388 --> 00:40:51,090
and very soon the Avenger will be born.

445
00:40:51,722 --> 00:40:53,367
It was almost easy.

446
00:40:56,629 --> 00:40:58,462
It hasn't felt easy at all!

447
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:01,287
You have no idea what I've had to endure,

448
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:03,011
the pain that it's caused!

449
00:41:03,198 --> 00:41:04,504
No, I don't.

450
00:41:04,585 --> 00:41:06,158
And I don't need to know.

451
00:41:33,263 --> 00:41:35,199
Berserker?

452
00:41:36,414 --> 00:41:37,397
Please, no.

453
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:39,119
Don't come inside.

454
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,925
Sakura is calling.

455
00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:54,026
Lucky for you, I have to go.

456
00:41:58,208 --> 00:42:00,541
No. It's not luck.

457
00:42:01,613 --> 00:42:03,396
You earned this for yourself...

458
00:42:04,097 --> 00:42:04,914
for now.

459
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:16,117
Shirou!

460
00:42:18,717 --> 00:42:19,743
Shirou.

461
00:42:22,497 --> 00:42:23,512
It's all right.

462
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:27,282
It's all right now.

463
00:42:28,021 --> 00:42:28,855
Let's go home.

464
00:43:30,744 --> 00:43:32,860
That's what happens when I use it.

465
00:43:42,296 --> 00:43:44,867
Oh, you're finally awake. How nice.

466
00:43:45,018 --> 00:43:45,957
Tohsaka!

467
00:43:46,684 --> 00:43:48,056
You're all right.

468
00:43:49,256 --> 00:43:50,517
Of course I am.

469
00:43:50,542 --> 00:43:53,549
Especially compared to say, you?

470
00:43:56,605 --> 00:43:59,025
Well, at least you're still alive.

471
00:44:00,517 --> 00:44:01,904
Wait. What is that?

472
00:44:03,097 --> 00:44:05,476
Oh, it's... it's, um...

473
00:44:07,051 --> 00:44:08,729
It's something special.

474
00:44:10,925 --> 00:44:13,592
I need to keep it until the end.

475
00:44:15,621 --> 00:44:16,404
What the...

476
00:44:17,224 --> 00:44:18,406
That was weird.

477
00:44:18,843 --> 00:44:19,867
What did I say?

478
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:21,716
Hold on to it.

479
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,231
Looks like there's a little magical energy left.

480
00:44:24,752 --> 00:44:25,830
Could be useful.

481
00:44:26,803 --> 00:44:29,025
Sounds like that was your plan anyway.

482
00:44:30,152 --> 00:44:32,200
Um, yeah.

483
00:44:35,485 --> 00:44:37,366
Now hurry up, and get ready, okay?

484
00:44:37,831 --> 00:44:39,135
We're heading out now.

485
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:52,857
You are the last two masters left in this Holy Grail War,

486
00:44:53,161 --> 00:44:55,058
so I'm going to tell you the truth.

487
00:44:56,614 --> 00:44:58,375
I'll cut to the heart of the matter.

488
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,090
It should explain some things.

489
00:45:00,814 --> 00:45:04,827
However, the first part is
nothing that concerns either of you.

490
00:45:07,398 --> 00:45:09,290
You know the rules of the War.

491
00:45:09,549 --> 00:45:14,788
Using seven Heroic Spirits, participants kill
each other to determine the rights to the Grail.

492
00:45:16,011 --> 00:45:19,852
But the truth is those rules are only a ploy.

493
00:45:21,606 --> 00:45:26,814
In fact, Masters are merely the catalysts
to summon the Servants to this world.

494
00:45:27,981 --> 00:45:32,152
Only the Heroic Spirits are
required to complete the Holy Grail.

495
00:45:33,346 --> 00:45:38,861
Their souls are harvested and placed into
the Lesser Grail created by the Einzberns.

496
00:45:39,292 --> 00:45:42,569
The Greater Grail requires them in order to be activated.

497
00:45:43,538 --> 00:45:45,458
Uh, the Greater Grail?

498
00:45:46,262 --> 00:45:49,413
It's a magic circle on the Tohsaka family land,

499
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:53,023
the overseer of the Holy Grail War system.

500
00:45:54,746 --> 00:45:57,348
It all started 300 years ago.

501
00:45:57,945 --> 00:46:02,229
The three founding families,
Einzbern, Makiri, and Tohsaka,

502
00:46:02,308 --> 00:46:06,180
wanted to use the Holy Grail
to reach outside of the world.

503
00:46:06,827 --> 00:46:08,601
That's the true objective,

504
00:46:09,609 --> 00:46:12,478
the ritual once thought lost to the Einzberns,

505
00:46:12,815 --> 00:46:16,164
great magic that could make true immortality possible.

506
00:46:17,196 --> 00:46:18,545
The Grail of Heaven,

507
00:46:19,066 --> 00:46:20,236
Heaven's Feel.

508
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,807
The secret to materializing the soul.

509
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:29,328
Now then...

510
00:46:29,673 --> 00:46:32,248
the rest of the story does concern you two.

511
00:46:34,181 --> 00:46:37,251
You mean Sakura, right? Please, Illya.

512
00:46:37,364 --> 00:46:39,522
I need to know what the hell's happening to her.

513
00:46:40,608 --> 00:46:42,435
Zouken has changed her,

514
00:46:43,014 --> 00:46:45,803
because he is trying to get control of something,

515
00:46:46,562 --> 00:46:48,806
something called Avenger.

516
00:46:50,109 --> 00:46:53,102
It's the eighth class within the Holy Grail War.

517
00:46:53,458 --> 00:46:55,069
It fused with Sakura

518
00:46:55,203 --> 00:46:58,013
and used her to project those black shadows,

519
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,171
Angra Mainyu.

520
00:47:02,045 --> 00:47:04,354
It's a story from an ancient village

521
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:06,791
that practiced Zoroastrianism.

522
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:11,568
The people wished to find a way for
humans to live a pure and just life

523
00:47:11,676 --> 00:47:13,401
and believed that, to do this,

524
00:47:13,489 --> 00:47:16,167
they must first be freed of all their evils.

525
00:47:17,203 --> 00:47:20,379
So they randomly selected one unlucky young man

526
00:47:20,594 --> 00:47:21,925
and singled him out.

527
00:47:22,217 --> 00:47:25,426
They placed all the sins of the world on his shoulders,

528
00:47:26,695 --> 00:47:28,464
using his "wickedness"

529
00:47:28,508 --> 00:47:31,924
to prove the "goodness" of all humans except him.

530
00:47:33,067 --> 00:47:34,242
They tortured him,

531
00:47:34,988 --> 00:47:37,688
and thus a hero was born.

532
00:47:38,583 --> 00:47:40,680
He was resented by the people,

533
00:47:41,077 --> 00:47:43,775
yet worshipped as a god at the same time,

534
00:47:44,322 --> 00:47:46,950
someone who was no one,

535
00:47:47,566 --> 00:47:50,719
the anti-hero, Angra Mainyu.

536
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:58,985
During the Third War, the Einzbern family
summoned Angra Mainyu to act as their Servant.

537
00:48:00,331 --> 00:48:02,975
However, he was very weak.

538
00:48:04,393 --> 00:48:08,361
He was quickly defeated and
absorbed into the Greater Grail.

539
00:48:10,399 --> 00:48:13,302
And then, as a result,

540
00:48:13,536 --> 00:48:16,543
the Holy Grail accepted a certain wish.

541
00:48:18,742 --> 00:48:22,983
It is an existence made by those
who willed its evil into being.

542
00:48:24,053 --> 00:48:25,949
And now because of the Grail,

543
00:48:26,416 --> 00:48:28,280
it has become a reality.

544
00:48:29,471 --> 00:48:32,201
It is the embodiment of all the world's evil.

545
00:48:32,332 --> 00:48:36,606
Given the chance, it will curse the
lives of every human on the planet.

546
00:48:37,844 --> 00:48:41,341
That is the true identity of the shadow.

547
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,860
At the end of the last War,

548
00:48:47,318 --> 00:48:49,320
Kiritsugu destroyed the Grail.

549
00:48:51,126 --> 00:48:54,996
Because of that, there was no
way for Angra Mainyu to be born.

550
00:48:55,882 --> 00:48:58,128
It was left inside the Greater Grail.

551
00:48:59,643 --> 00:49:02,690
Part of it attached itself to Kirei Kotomine,

552
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:06,694
and Zouken turned Sakura into an artificial Grail.

553
00:49:07,342 --> 00:49:11,198
He took a shard of what remained
and planted it inside her.

554
00:49:12,804 --> 00:49:14,702
But Avenger's still a Servant,

555
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:17,465
and a Servant must obey its Master.

556
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:20,690
And since Zouken controls Sakura,

557
00:49:20,845 --> 00:49:22,451
he made her a Master,

558
00:49:22,673 --> 00:49:24,744
giving him control of Avenger.

559
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:28,299
Master...

560
00:49:28,776 --> 00:49:30,094
and Servant.

561
00:49:31,348 --> 00:49:34,276
Optimistically, she has half a day left.

562
00:49:34,879 --> 00:49:38,895
If that thing is fully born,
she will transform completely.

563
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:41,347
No one will be able to save her.

564
00:49:41,903 --> 00:49:44,014
No one will be saved at all.

565
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:53,788
Okay, Shirou, I want you to do something
before we go running into enemy territory.

566
00:49:55,983 --> 00:49:59,544
To be honest, you may have saved
us all by bringing Illya back.

567
00:50:00,929 --> 00:50:03,270
The two of you are going to need to work together.

568
00:50:03,656 --> 00:50:05,472
Take the memories of the Einzberns

569
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:08,106
and the memories of the land where the Leyline flows.

570
00:50:09,065 --> 00:50:11,422
Use them to project a special weapon,

571
00:50:11,748 --> 00:50:13,260
the Jeweled Sword.

572
00:50:14,708 --> 00:50:16,703
Why? What is it?

573
00:50:16,845 --> 00:50:20,405
The Tohsakas have held that
treasure's secret for generations,

574
00:50:21,324 --> 00:50:22,300
and now...

575
00:50:23,435 --> 00:50:25,990
we're going to use it to fight Sakura.

576
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:30,277
All right.

577
00:50:37,036 --> 00:50:39,448
The Azoth Blade closely resembles it.

578
00:50:39,861 --> 00:50:42,480
I've infused it with ten years of my mana.

579
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:45,334
Use it to support your projection.

580
00:50:50,844 --> 00:50:51,630
Shirou...

581
00:50:52,773 --> 00:50:53,926
tell me the truth.

582
00:50:54,075 --> 00:50:56,104
How long do you think you can last?

583
00:51:01,218 --> 00:51:03,020
I honestly don't know.

584
00:51:04,574 --> 00:51:08,097
But hey, I'll keep going as long as I'm alive.

585
00:51:15,475 --> 00:51:16,962
I'm gonna be okay.

586
00:51:26,835 --> 00:51:28,287
Focus on the sword.

587
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,533
Only look at what you need to.

588
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:34,633
Uh, okay.

589
00:51:44,781 --> 00:51:45,575
The ocean?

590
00:51:48,054 --> 00:51:48,815
Shirou.

591
00:52:03,248 --> 00:52:04,320
Shinji?

592
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:06,595
No.

593
00:52:07,516 --> 00:52:08,584
It's not here.

594
00:52:09,349 --> 00:52:10,618
Let's jump further ahead.

595
00:52:29,697 --> 00:52:32,066
Little bit further. Let's go.

596
00:52:32,551 --> 00:52:33,328
Uh, what...

597
00:52:38,778 --> 00:52:40,844
...all forms of evil eradicated.

598
00:52:41,365 --> 00:52:42,313
To do this...

599
00:52:42,376 --> 00:52:43,791
This is the right place.

600
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:47,433
Shirou, don't take your eyes off of him.

601
00:52:49,602 --> 00:52:52,419
This objective has my full support.

602
00:52:52,728 --> 00:52:54,818
Because they wish to reach the Root,

603
00:52:54,882 --> 00:52:59,092
the three members, Einzbern, Tohsaka, and Makiri,

604
00:52:59,194 --> 00:53:02,002
will cooperate with each other to open the path.

605
00:53:02,602 --> 00:53:05,432
Declare your contributions to this cause.

606
00:53:06,413 --> 00:53:11,929
So declared, the Tohsakas offer the
spiritual grounds to build the Holy Grail.

607
00:53:12,468 --> 00:53:18,769
So declared, The Makiris offer the Command
Spell for the Servants so they may be sacrificed.

608
00:53:19,516 --> 00:53:25,196
It is so declared, the Einzberns offer
the magic circle to reach the Third Magic.

609
00:53:26,001 --> 00:53:32,897
Good. I, Kischur Zelretch Schweinorg,
will be acting as the witness for this ritual.

610
00:53:33,802 --> 00:53:35,413
You may now begin.

611
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:10,443
Our gate connecting to the Root...

612
00:54:12,737 --> 00:54:13,988
be released.

613
00:54:25,987 --> 00:54:27,194
Be released.

614
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,384
Be released.

615
00:54:49,526 --> 00:54:50,304
Shirou!

616
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:26,740
You look terrible,

617
00:55:27,221 --> 00:55:28,752
like death itself.

618
00:55:30,204 --> 00:55:32,371
Uh, R-Rider?

619
00:55:33,657 --> 00:55:36,173
I've been watching you from a distance.

620
00:55:39,023 --> 00:55:42,923
My sworn duty is to protect you, Shirou Emiya,

621
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:46,218
but you've created a weapon to use against Sakura.

622
00:55:49,229 --> 00:55:51,871
As long as you plan on bringing harm to her,

623
00:55:52,483 --> 00:55:54,229
I cannot protect you.

624
00:55:59,451 --> 00:56:02,549
So, what, you here to kill me?

625
00:56:04,183 --> 00:56:06,822
Shirou, you should know.

626
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:10,524
Sakura summoned me without the use of a catalyst.

627
00:56:12,468 --> 00:56:18,547
When that happens, the Servant that is
chosen is very close to the Master's state.

628
00:56:20,023 --> 00:56:21,003
Honestly...

629
00:56:21,777 --> 00:56:24,298
I didn't want to turn her into a monster.

630
00:56:26,832 --> 00:56:28,844
But now...

631
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:35,601
Shirou, I cannot let you make Sakura suffer.

632
00:56:35,745 --> 00:56:37,157
I'm not gonna kill her.

633
00:56:38,665 --> 00:56:40,387
I'm going to save her.

634
00:56:41,657 --> 00:56:44,843
I promise. I'm on Sakura's side.

635
00:56:48,116 --> 00:56:51,379
No matter what comes to pass, I'll choose her.

636
00:56:52,489 --> 00:56:53,784
On her side?

637
00:56:54,855 --> 00:56:57,039
Is this your answer to my question?

638
00:56:57,927 --> 00:56:59,565
But can I trust you?

639
00:57:00,656 --> 00:57:04,195
For this to work, there's someone I still have to beat,

640
00:57:04,894 --> 00:57:06,886
and I could really use your help now.

641
00:57:12,504 --> 00:57:14,632
Do we have a fair chance of winning?

642
00:57:15,037 --> 00:57:15,854
Yes.

643
00:57:18,528 --> 00:57:19,781
Then I'm with you.

644
00:57:26,323 --> 00:57:28,189
Your Servant, Rider.

645
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:30,530
It's only temporary,

646
00:57:30,848 --> 00:57:32,697
but I shall become your wings.

647
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:36,006
We'll go as far as we can for Sakura.

648
00:57:53,934 --> 00:57:56,890
For a second there, I thought
you were actually coming back.

649
00:57:58,442 --> 00:58:00,394
But you only flew out your shadow.

650
00:58:00,742 --> 00:58:03,561
Flexing our muscles, are we? How cute.

651
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:05,774
Big sister...

652
00:58:06,481 --> 00:58:08,846
please take Shirou, and run away.

653
00:58:10,076 --> 00:58:11,497
If you do that for me,

654
00:58:11,893 --> 00:58:15,158
I promise I'll give my life to kill it.

655
00:58:17,925 --> 00:58:21,248
I gotta ask, even though I know the answer,

656
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:24,543
do you want to cut ties with Angra Mainyu?

657
00:58:29,718 --> 00:58:30,924
No, I don't.

658
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,075
For the first time in my life, I have power.

659
00:58:34,521 --> 00:58:38,194
Even if I did want to let go of it, I couldn't.

660
00:58:39,313 --> 00:58:41,852
So you're saying if I take Shirou away,

661
00:58:42,392 --> 00:58:46,709
you'll stop this by killing yourself
and taking Angra Mainyu with you?

662
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:50,944
Yes, that's right. Please.

663
00:58:53,169 --> 00:58:54,241
That's a lie.

664
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:58,994
The truth is you don't know how much
longer you can keep holding yourself back.

665
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:01,471
Didn't you notice?

666
00:59:02,629 --> 00:59:06,043
Oh, come on. You can't even keep your story straight.

667
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:09,464
First you said you'd give your life to kill it.

668
00:59:09,769 --> 00:59:12,090
Then you said you could never give it up.

669
00:59:17,393 --> 00:59:19,011
Just be patient,

670
00:59:19,249 --> 00:59:21,115
because I'm coming for you.

671
00:59:22,631 --> 00:59:26,328
And then I'll be sure to kill you myself.

672
00:59:28,111 --> 00:59:29,006
Yes.

673
00:59:29,568 --> 00:59:33,070
I'll be waiting for you, big sister.

674
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:39,892
Big sister.

675
00:59:50,956 --> 00:59:53,792
Good to see you make it back here, Assassin.

676
00:59:54,329 --> 00:59:57,191
Lord Magus, you're alive?

677
00:59:57,764 --> 01:00:00,693
I am. But in my current state,

678
01:00:00,765 --> 01:00:04,114
I cannot supply you with magical energy.

679
01:00:05,003 --> 01:00:07,908
Sakura, this will put a burden on you,

680
01:00:07,964 --> 01:00:10,440
but you must forge a pact with Assassin.

681
01:00:13,346 --> 01:00:14,591
Sakura.

682
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:23,059
My Lord, I think the girl... is gone.

683
01:00:26,606 --> 01:00:29,075
What a disappointing conclusion.

684
01:00:30,389 --> 01:00:33,294
What will you do, proceed with the plan?

685
01:00:33,886 --> 01:00:35,924
You can hardly call it that,

686
01:00:36,153 --> 01:00:37,968
but there's no choice.

687
01:00:39,586 --> 01:00:41,471
Farewell, Sakura.

688
01:00:42,256 --> 01:00:46,768
You've endured more than I ever
expected from a mere guinea pig.

689
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,186
Delightful.

690
01:00:48,776 --> 01:00:50,935
There's no need for that, grandfather.

691
01:01:15,648 --> 01:01:16,997
Oh, that's why.

692
01:01:17,521 --> 01:01:20,813
You were hiding the fact that you don't even have a face.

693
01:01:22,496 --> 01:01:24,512
Damn you.

694
01:01:24,948 --> 01:01:27,058
You're a nobody belonging nowhere.

695
01:01:28,083 --> 01:01:31,277
You're never going to become the one-and-only anything.

696
01:01:33,369 --> 01:01:36,615
I just want to know my...

697
01:01:41,415 --> 01:01:44,336
Wh-What do you think you're doing, Sakura?

698
01:01:47,194 --> 01:01:48,551
That's obvious.

699
01:01:49,083 --> 01:01:52,980
You no longer needed to be
protected by him, did you, grandfather?

700
01:01:58,233 --> 01:01:59,947
I spent so much time

701
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,762
wondering how, wherever I went, you were always with me

702
01:02:04,312 --> 01:02:06,709
and why you had me, do whatever you wanted.

703
01:02:09,462 --> 01:02:11,527
It's exactly what I expected.

704
01:02:16,517 --> 01:02:19,888
The real you has been hiding inside my body all along.

705
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:25,015
Honestly, grandfather,

706
01:02:25,084 --> 01:02:27,712
I thought for sure you were going to be bigger than that.

707
01:02:30,584 --> 01:02:31,324
No!

708
01:02:31,482 --> 01:02:33,667
Sakura, please, wait!

709
01:02:34,688 --> 01:02:37,410
This is goodbye, grandfather.

710
01:02:48,154 --> 01:02:49,312
First my brother,

711
01:02:49,415 --> 01:02:51,313
and now grandfather's gone, too.

712
01:02:51,916 --> 01:02:52,940
Next, I...

713
01:02:54,626 --> 01:02:55,994
Next, I can...

714
01:02:57,897 --> 01:02:58,621
What?

715
01:03:02,064 --> 01:03:03,905
What am I going to do now?

716
01:03:12,944 --> 01:03:14,220
We're not finished.

717
01:03:15,427 --> 01:03:16,418
Not yet.

718
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:17,768
There are more.

719
01:03:19,312 --> 01:03:20,879
They'll be here soon.

720
01:03:25,703 --> 01:03:26,803
Go, please.

721
01:03:26,973 --> 01:03:29,147
Only let big sister pass through.

722
01:03:30,096 --> 01:03:31,433
And Shirou Emiya?

723
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:36,104
I'm amazed, but it's more than I realized.

724
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:43,119
I care about Sakura. She means everything to me.

725
01:04:48,436 --> 01:04:49,344
This is it.

726
01:04:50,007 --> 01:04:50,817
Good luck.

727
01:04:52,102 --> 01:04:52,665
Rin...

728
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:54,348
Rider...

729
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:56,515
Shirou.

730
01:05:01,506 --> 01:05:02,232
Illya...

731
01:05:03,641 --> 01:05:05,276
after this battle's over,

732
01:05:05,695 --> 01:05:07,862
you may not have a place to go back to,

733
01:05:08,712 --> 01:05:11,366
but you could keep living at my house.

734
01:05:12,171 --> 01:05:14,369
Are you going to replace Kiritsugu?

735
01:05:15,297 --> 01:05:19,338
Uh, no. Kiritsugu and I are different people.

736
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:22,585
But I will...

737
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:33,843
Shirou, crouch down, please.

738
01:05:34,733 --> 01:05:36,217
O-okay.

739
01:05:46,468 --> 01:05:48,586
Be careful, Shirou. You got that?

740
01:05:49,063 --> 01:05:50,303
Be home by morning,

741
01:05:50,539 --> 01:05:52,949
and make sure you bring Sakura back with you.

742
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:11,599
I sense something,

743
01:06:11,845 --> 01:06:14,653
a field of power being generated up at the lake.

744
01:06:16,661 --> 01:06:18,709
The field up there is the dummy gate.

745
01:06:19,653 --> 01:06:21,853
But we're here to find the Greater Grail,

746
01:06:22,085 --> 01:06:23,176
so...

747
01:06:26,951 --> 01:06:29,949
We're gonna have to go down and not up.

748
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:35,492
Going down.

749
01:07:08,987 --> 01:07:09,947
What's the matter?

750
01:07:11,051 --> 01:07:12,638
Uh, nothing.

751
01:07:13,075 --> 01:07:14,396
Don't lose focus.

752
01:07:14,439 --> 01:07:17,592
From this point forward, just worry about your own life.

753
01:07:37,252 --> 01:07:38,263
Saber.

754
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:42,517
Rin.

755
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:48,210
Oh, I get it.

756
01:07:51,449 --> 01:07:53,903
Sakura's taking this seriously.

757
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,870
Sorry, guys. I'm gonna go ahead without you.

758
01:08:07,027 --> 01:08:10,865
If you're planning on saving Sakura,
Shirou, you'd better catch up quick.

759
01:08:30,577 --> 01:08:33,847
Saber, I'm sorry, but we're coming through.

760
01:08:34,554 --> 01:08:35,550
You won't.

761
01:08:35,868 --> 01:08:37,804
This is the role I was given.

762
01:08:40,144 --> 01:08:44,074
Using all my powers, I can hold her off for two minutes.

763
01:08:44,566 --> 01:08:46,612
I'll find an opportunity for you.

764
01:08:49,597 --> 01:08:51,009
Wait here, and watch,

765
01:08:51,137 --> 01:08:52,899
but don't miss your chance.

766
01:08:57,732 --> 01:09:01,510
Saber, we will eliminate you right here.

767
01:09:02,947 --> 01:09:04,730
I'm going to save Sakura.

768
01:09:08,114 --> 01:09:10,368
Which means I'll kill you.

769
01:10:29,329 --> 01:10:32,161
This is it, the Greater Grail.

770
01:10:40,796 --> 01:10:43,239
You came all the way here instead of running.

771
01:10:49,405 --> 01:10:50,588
I've been thinking.

772
01:10:53,397 --> 01:10:54,834
And I've realized...

773
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,715
I hate this world.

774
01:10:57,723 --> 01:11:01,215
The house, you, grandfather,

775
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:03,634
my pathetic big brother,

776
01:11:03,858 --> 01:11:05,683
the whole "peaceful" city.

777
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:10,422
Everyone who never made an
effort to save me is unforgiveable.

778
01:11:11,579 --> 01:11:13,603
I'm taking my anger out on them,

779
01:11:13,896 --> 01:11:16,147
and I realize that it's not healthy.

780
01:11:17,253 --> 01:11:19,442
But I've become so much stronger.

781
01:11:21,261 --> 01:11:23,420
I can do anything I want to now.

782
01:11:24,492 --> 01:11:25,325
Really?

783
01:11:25,817 --> 01:11:27,785
You've gotten used to murder, have you?

784
01:11:28,467 --> 01:11:29,360
Yes.

785
01:11:29,908 --> 01:11:32,512
Grandfather and Assassin can't bother me now.

786
01:11:33,337 --> 01:11:34,242
And all that's left...

787
01:11:34,267 --> 01:11:35,750
And what about Shirou?

788
01:11:37,806 --> 01:11:38,981
That fool.

789
01:11:39,371 --> 01:11:42,091
He still has it in his head that he can save you.

790
01:11:43,417 --> 01:11:46,113
Shirou is the only person in the whole world

791
01:11:46,138 --> 01:11:47,496
I want to kill.

792
01:11:48,758 --> 01:11:49,726
How sad.

793
01:11:50,064 --> 01:11:52,199
You've already given up on your humanity.

794
01:11:53,493 --> 01:11:55,056
You act so tough.

795
01:11:55,731 --> 01:11:58,000
You're jealous of this power, aren't you?

796
01:11:58,723 --> 01:12:00,262
You want to take it from me

797
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:03,358
so that you and you alone can be happy.

798
01:12:13,594 --> 01:12:14,956
You can't have it.

799
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:17,728
But there are two things I will give you,

800
01:12:17,943 --> 01:12:20,044
regret and despair.

801
01:12:30,478 --> 01:12:33,152
You shall drown inside the Grail of Heaven,

802
01:12:33,604 --> 01:12:35,941
like a bug dropped into a lake.

803
01:13:35,352 --> 01:13:36,043
Damn it.

804
01:13:47,964 --> 01:13:49,661
The curse of Mystic Eyes.

805
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:05,182
Rider, I wanted to ask,

806
01:14:05,745 --> 01:14:10,488
about Saber, is it possible for someone
to damage her if they're not a Servant?

807
01:14:11,365 --> 01:14:15,680
Yes. Sakura's captive Servants are all incarnations.

808
01:14:16,696 --> 01:14:19,459
A powerful Mystic Code should be enough.

809
01:14:21,752 --> 01:14:23,015
That's good news.

810
01:14:23,316 --> 01:14:25,336
Then I know what we need to do to beat her.

811
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:35,900
Yes, that strategy could very well do the trick.

812
01:14:38,299 --> 01:14:39,240
Except...

813
01:14:39,677 --> 01:14:41,424
We'll have to trust each other.

814
01:14:42,043 --> 01:14:43,020
Do we?

815
01:14:45,114 --> 01:14:49,667
Shirou, are you able to stand by when an ally's in danger?

816
01:14:51,929 --> 01:14:55,271
This will require you to use your worst skill.

817
01:15:09,563 --> 01:15:10,840
I believe in you!

818
01:15:28,626 --> 01:15:30,609
He's not going to move.

819
01:15:31,705 --> 01:15:32,987
He trusts me.

820
01:15:34,943 --> 01:15:37,094
He'll wait for me to defeat you.

821
01:15:38,151 --> 01:15:40,769
Oh, but he did try to help you.

822
01:15:42,531 --> 01:15:44,070
Stop talking!

823
01:17:09,358 --> 01:17:11,877
You think this is enough to contain me?!

824
01:17:16,469 --> 01:17:17,405
Phantasm!

825
01:17:24,130 --> 01:17:24,979
Bring it on!

826
01:17:35,716 --> 01:17:37,778
Now projection start.

827
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:39,613
Searching.

828
01:17:40,176 --> 01:17:41,157
Select.

829
01:17:41,573 --> 01:17:42,406
Analyze.

830
01:17:47,881 --> 01:17:50,692
I am the bone of my sword.

831
01:17:53,536 --> 01:17:54,679
Rho...

832
01:17:55,005 --> 01:17:56,218
Ex...

833
01:17:59,536 --> 01:18:00,634
Aias!

834
01:18:02,687 --> 01:18:04,575
...calibur!

835
01:18:20,724 --> 01:18:21,963
Bellero...

836
01:18:24,697 --> 01:18:27,199
phon!

837
01:19:16,211 --> 01:19:17,204
Shirou?

838
01:19:30,552 --> 01:19:32,996
Thank you, Saber,

839
01:19:33,884 --> 01:19:35,811
for all the times you saved me.

840
01:19:58,282 --> 01:19:59,451
I'll go on ahead.

841
01:19:59,869 --> 01:20:01,661
Catch up when you can run again.

842
01:20:06,962 --> 01:20:08,455
Full of surprises.

843
01:20:08,765 --> 01:20:11,058
You work people harder than expected.

844
01:20:57,288 --> 01:20:58,192
Why, you...

845
01:21:28,985 --> 01:21:29,803
No way.

846
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:35,961
How did you...

847
01:21:37,049 --> 01:21:38,707
Isn't that obvious?

848
01:21:39,738 --> 01:21:42,214
This is purely a contest of power.

849
01:21:44,231 --> 01:21:45,065
Your weapon...

850
01:21:45,647 --> 01:21:47,037
there's something about it.

851
01:21:47,746 --> 01:21:49,698
Do you know what this is, Sakura?

852
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:54,350
Take a look. You're facing off
against the Jeweled Sword of Zelretch.

853
01:21:55,056 --> 01:22:00,575
It connects to an infinite number of parallel
universes and channels magical energy from them all.

854
01:22:03,651 --> 01:22:06,177
Sword of Zelretch?

855
01:22:08,398 --> 01:22:12,230
Honestly. You've never even heard the name Zelretch?

856
01:22:13,358 --> 01:22:15,013
Don't mock me!

857
01:22:18,975 --> 01:22:21,284
No matter how much energy you've banked up,

858
01:22:21,451 --> 01:22:23,816
you can only use so much of it at a time,

859
01:22:23,864 --> 01:22:26,024
and I can match that easily.

860
01:22:26,712 --> 01:22:29,194
I only need enough to defend each attack.

861
01:22:29,267 --> 01:22:31,616
I can always draw in more next time.

862
01:22:37,567 --> 01:22:40,083
You've pooled up a ludicrous amount of power,

863
01:22:40,218 --> 01:22:43,289
but in your hands, it's a complete and utter waste.

864
01:22:53,291 --> 01:22:54,494
It's not fair.

865
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:58,540
Not fair.

866
01:23:06,435 --> 01:23:07,435
Not fair!

867
01:23:29,739 --> 01:23:31,889
That's all the power you can manage.

868
01:23:31,948 --> 01:23:33,661
Have you cooled your head now?

869
01:23:36,723 --> 01:23:37,937
It's not fair.

870
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:39,879
How could you?

871
01:23:40,831 --> 01:23:42,220
How could you?!

872
01:23:42,458 --> 01:23:44,204
I am your sister, aren't I,

873
01:23:44,339 --> 01:23:47,593
but most of my life, I haven't
even been treated like I'm human!

874
01:23:48,116 --> 01:23:50,728
Makiri's Magecraft was carved into me.

875
01:23:51,188 --> 01:23:53,244
All of my meals were poisoned.

876
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:58,442
Eating was painful, and worse, it terrified me!

877
01:23:59,164 --> 01:24:03,608
In the worm pit, I needed to
ask for permission to even breathe.

878
01:24:04,529 --> 01:24:05,870
Whenever I cried,

879
01:24:06,227 --> 01:24:10,091
they would only rejoice as they kept on violating my body!

880
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:15,008
Meanwhile, you were always shining so bright.

881
01:24:15,670 --> 01:24:18,085
Growing up, everything was easy for you,

882
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:19,776
and I hated you for it.

883
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:21,919
I wanted to win!

884
01:24:23,133 --> 01:24:25,978
Just once, I wanted my sister to praise me,

885
01:24:26,084 --> 01:24:27,980
to tell me I was amazing!

886
01:24:28,949 --> 01:24:32,631
Because I was born into the Tohsaka family,

887
01:24:33,291 --> 01:24:38,171
I always believed you would
come for me one day to rescue me.

888
01:24:38,834 --> 01:24:39,945
But no.

889
01:24:40,167 --> 01:24:42,470
You never bothered with me at all!

890
01:24:43,549 --> 01:24:45,581
I waited 11 years.

891
01:24:46,594 --> 01:24:48,513
My life's a disaster.

892
01:24:49,729 --> 01:24:52,198
But is any of it really my fault?

893
01:24:52,737 --> 01:24:54,102
So much pain.

894
01:24:54,515 --> 01:24:57,134
Every day full of pain!

895
01:24:57,952 --> 01:25:01,119
I didn't want things to be this way.

896
01:25:02,091 --> 01:25:03,618
This was all I could do.

897
01:25:04,115 --> 01:25:05,726
I had no choice!

898
01:25:09,655 --> 01:25:11,773
That's a terribly sad story.

899
01:25:12,483 --> 01:25:13,427
So what?

900
01:25:19,373 --> 01:25:22,933
I mean, you're not exactly in pain anymore, are you?

901
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:28,894
That's my point!

902
01:25:29,053 --> 01:25:30,542
You don't even care!

903
01:25:31,549 --> 01:25:35,186
I'm sorry, but I don't really
understand other people's pain.

904
01:25:36,615 --> 01:25:37,900
That's how I am.

905
01:25:38,475 --> 01:25:41,083
No matter what kind of torture you had to go through,

906
01:25:41,496 --> 01:25:43,272
I'll never be able to relate.

907
01:25:46,676 --> 01:25:47,724
But, Sakura...

908
01:25:49,039 --> 01:25:51,503
even as insensitive as I happen to be...

909
01:25:52,929 --> 01:25:55,901
even after hearing you cry about of your problems,

910
01:25:57,024 --> 01:25:59,460
I never thought of myself as being blessed.

911
01:26:08,149 --> 01:26:09,736
How dare you?

912
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:13,530
You were!

913
01:26:13,887 --> 01:26:15,672
How can you say that?!

914
01:26:17,505 --> 01:26:18,569
Sakura...

915
01:26:27,372 --> 01:26:28,855
Welt, Ende.

916
01:27:22,889 --> 01:27:25,000
Oh. This isn't good.

917
01:27:39,828 --> 01:27:41,798
Big sister?

918
01:27:50,292 --> 01:27:52,047
I'm a complete idiot.

919
01:27:53,245 --> 01:27:57,872
But I can't stand it when people try
their hardest and end up with nothing.

920
01:27:58,705 --> 01:28:00,532
I really do love you, Sakura.

921
01:28:01,799 --> 01:28:03,913
I've always wanted to see you smile.

922
01:28:08,286 --> 01:28:11,161
I wanted to believe that as long as I suffered,

923
01:28:11,699 --> 01:28:14,498
it would only make your life that much easier.

924
01:28:16,540 --> 01:28:19,878
I guess I can't really criticize Shirou, can I?

925
01:28:24,626 --> 01:28:28,626
Once I saw you up close, I realized
that I really couldn't kill you.

926
01:28:30,272 --> 01:28:31,409
I'm sorry.

927
01:28:32,321 --> 01:28:34,476
I'm a selfish big sister.

928
01:28:35,292 --> 01:28:37,687
But I'm happy, because...

929
01:28:38,536 --> 01:28:42,317
you've been wearing that ribbon all this time.

930
01:29:10,757 --> 01:29:12,222
She loves me?

931
01:29:14,767 --> 01:29:18,069
I've been waiting to hear her say that.

932
01:29:21,368 --> 01:29:22,274
But now...

933
01:29:24,147 --> 01:29:25,274
I killed her.

934
01:29:25,383 --> 01:29:26,653
She's gone.

935
01:30:01,386 --> 01:30:03,696
Oh. Shirou.

936
01:30:20,744 --> 01:30:21,847
She's dead.

937
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:25,355
I... I killed her!

938
01:30:26,022 --> 01:30:28,840
My sister, she's gone.

939
01:30:29,313 --> 01:30:31,458
She always told me not to give up,

940
01:30:31,483 --> 01:30:34,031
but I was too stupid to understand!

941
01:30:34,959 --> 01:30:36,431
I hate this!

942
01:30:37,258 --> 01:30:39,637
Now I have to stop it!

943
01:30:44,893 --> 01:30:46,399
Nice job, Tohsaka.

944
01:30:47,385 --> 01:30:48,465
You just won.

945
01:30:51,741 --> 01:30:55,106
Sakura, Tohsaka's still alive!

946
01:30:57,201 --> 01:30:58,620
It's not too late.

947
01:30:59,193 --> 01:31:01,206
You and I can save her together!

948
01:31:11,615 --> 01:31:14,143
Oh, no! You have to get away from here!

949
01:31:23,161 --> 01:31:24,263
No, that's...

950
01:31:24,883 --> 01:31:26,296
I don't want to do this.

951
01:31:26,923 --> 01:31:27,922
Get away!

952
01:31:28,097 --> 01:31:29,153
Yeah, I know,

953
01:31:29,557 --> 01:31:31,945
but that little brat's being a sore loser!

954
01:31:48,444 --> 01:31:51,689
Shirou, take my sister, and get out of here!

955
01:32:12,859 --> 01:32:14,529
I can't hold it back.

956
01:32:15,827 --> 01:32:17,615
Go now, please!

957
01:32:23,617 --> 01:32:25,071
Please stop this!

958
01:32:25,738 --> 01:32:28,468
Let me go! I can die here alone!

959
01:32:29,006 --> 01:32:30,628
I don't want you to see this!

960
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:32,171
Let me die!

961
01:32:40,796 --> 01:32:42,400
Why won't you stop?

962
01:32:42,861 --> 01:32:45,304
I don't deserve to be saved.

963
01:32:45,812 --> 01:32:48,915
No, I shouldn't be saved at all!

964
01:32:58,074 --> 01:32:58,930
Hang on!

965
01:33:13,636 --> 01:33:14,684
Sakura.

966
01:33:24,545 --> 01:33:25,767
You see, Shirou?

967
01:33:26,696 --> 01:33:27,885
That's what I mean.

968
01:33:29,022 --> 01:33:32,315
I... This is what I have become now,

969
01:33:33,038 --> 01:33:34,265
so just go!

970
01:33:43,586 --> 01:33:44,624
Look at me.

971
01:33:45,196 --> 01:33:47,372
I've killed so many people...

972
01:33:47,901 --> 01:33:50,632
my brother, grandfather,

973
01:33:51,608 --> 01:33:54,021
and now even my big sister!

974
01:33:55,019 --> 01:33:58,400
So tell me, do I really deserve to live

975
01:33:58,511 --> 01:34:00,661
after the terrible things I've done?!

976
01:34:00,686 --> 01:34:01,692
You do!

977
01:34:02,392 --> 01:34:03,543
Can't you see?

978
01:34:04,715 --> 01:34:06,207
You took their lives.

979
01:34:06,256 --> 01:34:08,017
Now take responsibility!

980
01:34:14,697 --> 01:34:16,490
Shirou, you...

981
01:34:26,632 --> 01:34:30,123
I don't know your sins or your punishment.

982
01:34:30,861 --> 01:34:32,600
I've no idea what they are.

983
01:34:33,234 --> 01:34:36,027
But I'll protect you from everything,

984
01:34:36,127 --> 01:34:38,408
everything that's coming for you, Sakura.

985
01:34:38,686 --> 01:34:40,123
I'll be right there!

986
01:34:41,258 --> 01:34:44,115
And sure, that may be hypocritical...

987
01:34:45,195 --> 01:34:48,036
but I will defend the one I love!

988
01:34:50,909 --> 01:34:53,284
Now trace on.

989
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:59,350
Time for your punishment.

990
01:35:01,067 --> 01:35:02,572
It's not going to to be easy.

991
01:35:03,218 --> 01:35:04,789
You better grit your teeth.

992
01:35:15,944 --> 01:35:16,766
Okay.

993
01:35:27,446 --> 01:35:29,486
Let's go home, Sakura.

994
01:35:30,176 --> 01:35:31,976
Cut your ties with this thing.

995
01:36:37,848 --> 01:36:40,482
It won't stop, will it?

996
01:37:03,073 --> 01:37:03,776
Shirou.

997
01:37:07,111 --> 01:37:09,192
Oh, uh, it's you.

998
01:37:09,541 --> 01:37:10,742
Perfect timing.

999
01:37:11,295 --> 01:37:14,152
Can you help take Sakura and Tohsaka

1000
01:37:14,557 --> 01:37:16,253
and get them out of this place?

1001
01:37:18,651 --> 01:37:20,944
R-Ri...

1002
01:37:23,994 --> 01:37:25,496
Yes, of course.

1003
01:37:30,045 --> 01:37:30,927
Thank you.

1004
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:34,223
Oh, and...

1005
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:39,633
Can you give this to Sakura?

1006
01:37:42,537 --> 01:37:45,195
No, Shirou. Do that yourself.

1007
01:37:51,163 --> 01:37:51,908
Fine.

1008
01:37:52,917 --> 01:37:53,812
Good luck.

1009
01:38:35,572 --> 01:38:36,619
Kotomine?

1010
01:38:37,349 --> 01:38:38,293
It's you.

1011
01:38:38,854 --> 01:38:41,437
Yes. And it seems...

1012
01:38:41,867 --> 01:38:44,877
you and I are both barely clinging to life,

1013
01:38:45,722 --> 01:38:48,305
Shirou Emiya.

1014
01:38:52,872 --> 01:38:57,252
Even if this thing gets out,
your wish will never be granted.

1015
01:38:58,133 --> 01:38:59,863
But that is my wish.

1016
01:39:00,688 --> 01:39:03,315
I have but only one objective here,

1017
01:39:03,641 --> 01:39:07,197
and that is to ensure the successful birth of this curse.

1018
01:39:07,862 --> 01:39:11,279
But why? Why are you protecting it?

1019
01:39:11,815 --> 01:39:14,442
It's evil, the definition of the word.

1020
01:39:14,911 --> 01:39:16,990
It is not evil yet,

1021
01:39:17,855 --> 01:39:19,760
nor is it good.

1022
01:39:20,792 --> 01:39:24,459
Humans become either good or evil
through the process of learning,

1023
01:39:25,683 --> 01:39:28,159
but they begin at zero.

1024
01:39:29,588 --> 01:39:33,864
At the start, the only truth
they know is the existence of truth.

1025
01:39:39,877 --> 01:39:42,752
Humans are capable of good and evil.

1026
01:39:43,306 --> 01:39:46,267
It's up to the individual to determine the difference.

1027
01:39:46,625 --> 01:39:49,018
There is no crime in one's birth.

1028
01:39:50,130 --> 01:39:53,138
There's a life longing to be born into the world.

1029
01:39:53,177 --> 01:39:56,193
Allowing that miracle to happen is love.

1030
01:39:57,320 --> 01:39:58,995
What a crock of shit.

1031
01:40:00,136 --> 01:40:03,387
That's what it means to me, Shirou Emiya.

1032
01:40:04,787 --> 01:40:08,002
You find your bliss in seeing the happiness of others.

1033
01:40:09,248 --> 01:40:14,282
I can only find mine in witnessing their suffering.

1034
01:40:42,526 --> 01:40:44,613
That body of yours is troublesome.

1035
01:40:44,970 --> 01:40:47,518
Whoever attacks it risks their own life.

1036
01:41:02,352 --> 01:41:06,645
Tell me, who are you to say that all killing is evil?

1037
01:41:07,367 --> 01:41:10,629
You're protecting Sakura Matou, the murderer, aren't you?!

1038
01:41:15,862 --> 01:41:18,505
How quintessentially human of you.

1039
01:41:18,961 --> 01:41:21,830
Evil men occasionally flirt with goodwill,

1040
01:41:22,283 --> 01:41:25,487
and saints willfully commit sins on a whim.

1041
01:41:25,979 --> 01:41:30,146
It is this contradiction that makes us human.

1042
01:41:30,757 --> 01:41:32,676
To live is to harbor both.

1043
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:35,450
Good and evil coexist in us all.

1044
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:47,275
That's bullshit. This thing only
exists to kill everything it touches!

1045
01:41:47,902 --> 01:41:49,759
Yes. That's right!

1046
01:41:49,869 --> 01:41:51,996
But we don't know how it feels about that.

1047
01:41:52,045 --> 01:41:55,406
That's what I want, to learn its true nature!

1048
01:41:55,891 --> 01:41:59,439
Will it lament its evil actions or laugh them off?

1049
01:41:59,796 --> 01:42:02,199
If it has no doubts about its function,

1050
01:42:02,342 --> 01:42:05,406
when it was humanity who wished for it to be what it is,

1051
01:42:05,561 --> 01:42:07,799
it cannot be evil!

1052
01:42:11,239 --> 01:42:13,002
When its life begins,

1053
01:42:13,027 --> 01:42:16,088
it will kill everything, just as it was asked.

1054
01:42:17,032 --> 01:42:19,983
When it stands alone as the sole survivor,

1055
01:42:20,476 --> 01:42:23,722
will it be able to forgive itself for what it's done?

1056
01:42:24,714 --> 01:42:28,559
That is exactly what I'm dying to know.

1057
01:42:31,871 --> 01:42:34,475
That's the lame wish that you want granted?

1058
01:42:35,212 --> 01:42:36,744
That's your excuse?!

1059
01:42:49,567 --> 01:42:53,679
An excuse? Nothing else in the world matters to me.

1060
01:42:54,029 --> 01:42:55,586
Do you understand?

1061
01:42:56,283 --> 01:43:00,511
You and I are on opposite extremes,
because you want nothing for yourself.

1062
01:43:00,555 --> 01:43:02,309
You only think of others.

1063
01:43:03,457 --> 01:43:06,679
However, our desires are very similar!

1064
01:43:28,192 --> 01:43:30,303
Oh, I get it.

1065
01:43:30,748 --> 01:43:35,292
We're similar because we both
think of ourselves as sinners.

1066
01:43:36,057 --> 01:43:38,220
But we both chose our path,

1067
01:43:38,588 --> 01:43:41,017
looking for salvation that would never come.

1068
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:49,432
You'll never back down, will you?

1069
01:43:51,793 --> 01:43:55,460
I also have to admit I'm taking out my anger.

1070
01:43:56,475 --> 01:43:59,547
I envy you people for what I could never have.

1071
01:44:00,943 --> 01:44:02,205
Seems fair.

1072
01:44:02,769 --> 01:44:04,947
I guess talking was a waste of time.

1073
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:06,951
I don't mind.

1074
01:44:08,093 --> 01:44:10,798
Neither of us has much time left anyway.

1075
01:44:25,914 --> 01:44:28,053
I don't want to die.

1076
01:44:28,651 --> 01:44:30,287
I don't want to die.

1077
01:44:31,057 --> 01:44:32,767
I don't want to die.

1078
01:44:33,357 --> 01:44:34,477
I don't...

1079
01:44:39,564 --> 01:44:41,942
I ask you, my mortal enemy...

1080
01:44:43,177 --> 01:44:46,153
why do you wish so fiercely not to die?

1081
01:44:55,065 --> 01:44:58,125
You want all forms of evil eradicated.

1082
01:44:58,348 --> 01:45:01,754
To do this, you sought out a miracle.

1083
01:45:04,688 --> 01:45:06,926
There is no salvation in this world.

1084
01:45:07,224 --> 01:45:08,625
As long as we're human,

1085
01:45:08,748 --> 01:45:11,036
we cannot be separated from evil.

1086
01:45:14,510 --> 01:45:20,481
We seek utopia, but we know that it lies in
a place that can never be reached by humans.

1087
01:45:21,683 --> 01:45:23,675
We wish to surpass humans,

1088
01:45:24,447 --> 01:45:26,961
to discover a new shape of humanity.

1089
01:45:28,377 --> 01:45:32,827
Yes. In order to eliminate all the evil of this world,

1090
01:45:33,771 --> 01:45:38,610
we promise we will risk our lives to achieve this dream.

1091
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:45,530
It's been 500 years,

1092
01:45:45,555 --> 01:45:49,672
but, looking back, that desire only lasted an instant.

1093
01:45:53,692 --> 01:45:58,487
Disappointing. To think I was just one step short.

1094
01:46:14,319 --> 01:46:15,411
It's over.

1095
01:46:16,279 --> 01:46:19,072
It appears it was a game of inches.

1096
01:46:26,315 --> 01:46:28,674
You are the last remaining Master.

1097
01:46:29,481 --> 01:46:32,371
Go and fulfill your sacred obligations.

1098
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:03,097
This is it.

1099
01:47:03,994 --> 01:47:05,557
This will be the end.

1100
01:47:06,684 --> 01:47:08,430
One more projection.

1101
01:47:19,859 --> 01:47:20,809
But wait.

1102
01:47:22,248 --> 01:47:24,855
Is that really the way?

1103
01:47:32,945 --> 01:47:33,627
No.

1104
01:47:34,477 --> 01:47:36,367
You won't die here, Shirou.

1105
01:47:45,816 --> 01:47:48,403
I'm the one that's going to close the gate.

1106
01:47:49,864 --> 01:47:52,443
Shirou, tell me,

1107
01:47:53,229 --> 01:47:55,010
do you want to keep on living?

1108
01:47:56,893 --> 01:47:59,098
In whatever form you can hold?

1109
01:48:02,969 --> 01:48:04,436
Do you want to live?

1110
01:48:07,783 --> 01:48:09,038
No. I...

1111
01:48:10,595 --> 01:48:12,412
I have to...

1112
01:48:13,038 --> 01:48:15,512
take it down with me.

1113
01:48:16,196 --> 01:48:18,895
Don't worry. Please.

1114
01:48:21,370 --> 01:48:22,243
Do you?

1115
01:48:34,278 --> 01:48:35,024
I do.

1116
01:48:37,239 --> 01:48:39,596
I do! I wanna live!

1117
01:48:42,516 --> 01:48:43,839
I'm so glad.

1118
01:48:49,557 --> 01:48:52,803
No, wait. Come back.

1119
01:48:54,255 --> 01:48:56,128
I'm going to show you a miracle,

1120
01:48:56,557 --> 01:48:58,723
and this one will be amazing.

1121
01:48:59,635 --> 01:49:01,025
Watch closely now.

1122
01:49:01,415 --> 01:49:03,749
You're about to see real magic.

1123
01:49:04,551 --> 01:49:05,710
I don't care.

1124
01:49:05,859 --> 01:49:09,334
Please! Please just come back!

1125
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:12,337
Damn it.

1126
01:49:12,630 --> 01:49:13,638
What's your name?

1127
01:49:14,311 --> 01:49:15,525
I don't remember.

1128
01:49:20,953 --> 01:49:24,099
You told me a big brother protects his little sister.

1129
01:49:30,161 --> 01:49:34,061
Well, I'm really your big sister, Shirou.

1130
01:49:35,461 --> 01:49:39,128
Which means I have to protect my little brother.

1131
01:49:41,930 --> 01:49:42,914
Illya!

1132
01:49:49,349 --> 01:49:50,126
Illya!

1133
01:49:50,778 --> 01:49:53,073
Illya! Illya!

1134
01:49:53,476 --> 01:49:54,505
Illya!

1135
01:49:54,625 --> 01:49:57,007
Illya! Illya!

1136
01:49:57,374 --> 01:50:00,511
Illya!

1137
01:51:57,555 --> 01:51:58,693
Shirou?

1138
01:52:34,637 --> 01:52:36,946
Well, that's our next team captain for you.

1139
01:52:37,430 --> 01:52:39,920
It looks like I can rest easy when I retire.

1140
01:52:48,284 --> 01:52:51,387
Why is it taking him so long to come back?

1141
01:53:08,485 --> 01:53:11,508
The Holy Grail War has finally come to an end.

1142
01:53:13,056 --> 01:53:15,025
The Greater Grail has been destroyed,

1143
01:53:15,573 --> 01:53:17,313
and it took the war with it.

1144
01:53:19,247 --> 01:53:22,684
I had to deal with the fallout
caused with the Mage's Association

1145
01:53:23,167 --> 01:53:25,572
while I waited for Sakura to recover.

1146
01:53:28,707 --> 01:53:32,144
Now I'm back, and I'm walking alongside her...

1147
01:53:34,112 --> 01:53:36,825
making up for 11 years of lost time.

1148
01:53:37,781 --> 01:53:39,479
And time is moving again.

1149
01:53:40,571 --> 01:53:42,095
At least we're together now.

1150
01:53:43,333 --> 01:53:46,896
Although he's not around anymore.

1151
01:53:48,578 --> 01:53:53,118
Because Shirou Emiya's body disintegrated.

1152
01:54:34,723 --> 01:54:35,660
Sakura...

1153
01:54:36,762 --> 01:54:38,428
Rin's just come back home.

1154
01:54:41,414 --> 01:54:42,518
That's great.

1155
01:54:43,327 --> 01:54:44,378
Thanks, Rider.

1156
01:54:48,476 --> 01:54:50,825
So, Sakura, how have you been?

1157
01:54:52,001 --> 01:54:55,138
Good. It's been a slow process,

1158
01:54:55,628 --> 01:54:59,335
but I think I'm finally in a place where
I can accept things for what they are.

1159
01:55:00,588 --> 01:55:02,860
If I let myself be crushed by guilt,

1160
01:55:03,216 --> 01:55:05,117
it's the same as running away.

1161
01:55:14,442 --> 01:55:16,013
Things that have changed

1162
01:55:16,474 --> 01:55:18,601
and things that need to change.

1163
01:55:20,481 --> 01:55:23,375
But I wonder how I'll tell if something has or not?

1164
01:55:24,724 --> 01:55:26,224
Hard to say right now.

1165
01:55:27,274 --> 01:55:29,089
I'm still looking for a path.

1166
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:32,392
And yet...

1167
01:56:01,346 --> 01:56:04,045
In a world that never stops changing...

1168
01:56:07,665 --> 01:56:09,800
some things always stay the same.

1169
01:56:28,215 --> 01:56:30,343
Sakura, what's wrong?

1170
01:56:36,916 --> 01:56:37,741
Nothing.

1171
01:56:41,197 --> 01:56:42,812
Hey, come on! Let's go!

1172
01:56:42,837 --> 01:56:45,207
Jeez, are you a little kid or what?

1173
01:56:47,019 --> 01:56:47,724
Hey...

1174
01:56:54,670 --> 01:56:57,166
Sakura, are you happy?

1175
01:57:08,690 --> 01:57:09,444
Yes.
