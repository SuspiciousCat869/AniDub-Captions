00:35:08.374 --> 00:35:10.877 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, there's not much
we can do if it happens.

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:11.844 position:35% line:89% align:start
Anyway...

00:35:11.878 --> 00:35:12.579 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:35:12.612 --> 00:35:13.745 position:27% line:83% align:start
...how 'bout you
go out with me?

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.482 position:13% line:83% align:start
[MAKOTO] Like I said, why
are we talking about this?!

00:35:19.052 --> 00:35:20.253 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CHIAKI]
That's what he says now,

00:35:20.286 --> 00:35:21.754 position:27% line:83% align:start
but I bet if he
got a girlfriend,

00:35:21.788 --> 00:35:23.423 position:7% line:89% align:start
he'd always pick her over us.

00:35:23.456 --> 00:35:26.392 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, did I ever tell you what a
total idiot my little sister is?

00:35:26.426 --> 00:35:29.262 position:5% line:83% align:start
Uh, I was talkin' about Kousuke,
in case you didn't notice.

00:35:29.295 --> 00:35:31.397 position:33% line:83% align:start
Forget him.
Let's talk about my sister.

00:35:31.431 --> 00:35:33.499 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, anyway... If Kousuke
finds a girlfriend--

00:35:33.534 --> 00:35:35.068 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let me tell you about my sister!

00:35:35.101 --> 00:35:37.003 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CHIAKI]
You wanna go out with me?!

00:35:40.006 --> 00:35:41.874 position:7% line:83% align:start
[CHIAKI] Don't come crying to
me when you change your mind

00:35:41.908 --> 00:35:44.277 position:5% line:89% align:start
too late about dating that girl.

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:46.246 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KOUSUKE]
Can we please just drop it now?

00:35:47.313 --> 00:35:48.982 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CHIAKI]
Uh? Makoto?

00:35:49.015 --> 00:35:50.817 position:19% line:83% align:start
--I'll take you home.
--[MAKOTO] No thanks.

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:52.353 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CHIAKI]
Yo, what's the matter?

00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:57.156 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KOUSUKE]
What's her problem?

00:35:57.190 --> 00:36:00.026 position:16% line:83% align:start
--That's all your fault!
--Ah! I didn't do anything.

00:36:04.198 --> 00:36:07.800 position:24% line:83% align:start
[KAZUKO] I thought
that you liked Chiaki.

00:36:07.834 --> 00:36:10.404 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hm. Didn't you feel
obligated to stick with him,

00:36:10.437 --> 00:36:12.072 position:13% line:89% align:start
to help keep him in line?

00:36:12.106 --> 00:36:14.508 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MAKOTO] I might've said
something like that before.

00:36:14.541 --> 00:36:16.809 position:21% line:83% align:start
What's the point of
pretending he never asked?

00:36:16.843 --> 00:36:17.777 position:16% line:89% align:start
Why not go out with him?

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:19.946 position:16% line:83% align:start
--No way! Not happening.
--[KAZUKO] How come?

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.448 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can't picture
Chiaki and I

00:36:21.482 --> 00:36:24.218 position:16% line:83% align:start
being anything more than
friends. That's how come.

00:36:24.251 --> 00:36:27.254 position:16% line:83% align:start
If it doesn't work out,
go back to the way things were.

00:36:27.288 --> 00:36:28.956 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're mature enough
to handle that.

00:36:28.989 --> 00:36:30.057 position:19% line:89% align:start
Thanks, but no thanks.

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:32.059 position:16% line:83% align:start
[KAZUKO] Sometimes these
things start off one sided,

00:36:32.092 --> 00:36:33.227 position:10% line:89% align:start
and the person grows on you.

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.195 position:16% line:89% align:start
It won't happen! Never!

00:36:35.229 --> 00:36:36.530 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:36:36.563 --> 00:36:39.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
So you're gonna act
like it never happened?

00:36:39.333 --> 00:36:41.035 position:16% line:89% align:start
I fell sorry for Chiaki.

00:36:41.068 --> 00:36:43.003 position:24% line:83% align:start
After he worked up
the courage...

00:36:43.037 --> 00:36:44.104 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:36:44.138 --> 00:36:45.372 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KAZUKO]
Well, then again,

00:36:45.406 --> 00:36:48.309 position:19% line:83% align:start
I suppose he wouldn't
even know that he did.

00:36:49.376 --> 00:36:50.911 position:27% line:89% align:start
[MAKOTO groans]

00:36:54.649 --> 00:36:56.884 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey, uh, you know how
Chiaki transferred

00:36:56.917 --> 00:36:59.953 position:10% line:83% align:start
to our school this spring? I
heard he'd been bouncing around

00:36:59.987 --> 00:37:01.388 position:19% line:83% align:start
from school to school
before that.

00:37:01.422 --> 00:37:02.624 position:33% line:89% align:start
Apparently.

00:37:02.657 --> 00:37:05.059 position:13% line:83% align:start
You think the rumors about
him living overseas are true?

00:37:05.092 --> 00:37:07.094 position:33% line:89% align:start
I doubt it.

00:37:07.127 --> 00:37:08.596 position:19% line:89% align:start
He sucks at languages.

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:10.465 position:35% line:83% align:start
--No, huh?
--No chance.

00:37:10.498 --> 00:37:12.099 position:24% line:83% align:start
[YURI] I wonder if
something happened to him

00:37:12.132 --> 00:37:12.833 position:21% line:89% align:start
at his last school?

00:37:12.866 --> 00:37:13.802 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MAKOTO]
Why don't you ask him?

00:37:13.834 --> 00:37:15.537 position:21% line:83% align:start
[YURI] I don't even
have his email address.

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:17.405 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MAKOTO]
So? He's in our class.

00:37:17.439 --> 00:37:20.074 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I know. But you're
such good friends with him.

00:37:20.107 --> 00:37:21.909 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MAKOTO] I wouldn't ask
him something like that.

00:37:21.942 --> 00:37:23.977 position:10% line:83% align:start
[MAKOTO] Besides, I wouldn't
say we're that close.

00:37:24.011 --> 00:37:24.646 position:41% line:83% align:start

Are you all right, Takase?

a latte back at them.

junior high at the time,

00:51:25.297 --> 00:51:27.765 position:10% line:83% align:start
but apparently some students
from the Volunteer Club

00:51:27.798 --> 00:51:30.935 position:5% line:83% align:start
at Kuranose Senior High had gone
to visit the retirement home

00:51:30.968 --> 00:51:33.037 position:10% line:89% align:start
where my grandmother lived.

with one of the students,

and she spoke to me
about him many times.

00:51:40.345 --> 00:51:43.281 position:19% line:83% align:start
about what a kind and
gentle boy he was.

that I began to kind

I got into senior high

00:52:01.166 --> 00:52:04.369 position:16% line:83% align:start
that that student's name
was Kousuke Tsuda.

Wow, things like that
really do happen.

00:52:06.871 --> 00:52:10.141 position:5% line:83% align:start

She's afraid of her own shadow.

drum up her courage.

And finally, finally,
we got her to tell Kousuke

00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:15.947 position:13% line:89% align:start
she's got a crush on him.

talking about. Is it me?

Kousuke told us.

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:49.215 position:19% line:83% align:start
He said that he wasn't
going out with you,

[MAKOTO]
Chiaki, there's something

01:02:40.913 --> 01:02:44.050 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've been wanting to ask
you for a while now.

01:02:44.084 --> 01:02:46.852 position:27% line:83% align:start
Do you have fun
playing ball with me?

[CHIAKI]
What're you talking about?

01:02:48.054 --> 01:02:50.589 position:10% line:83% align:start
I mean, I have a lot of fun
playing baseball with you.

01:02:50.623 --> 01:02:52.058 position:24% line:83% align:start
[CHIAKI chuckles]
You sure suck

01:02:52.092 --> 01:02:53.525 position:27% line:83% align:start
for someone who
likes it so much.

01:02:53.559 --> 01:02:55.195 position:27% line:83% align:start
You'd suck too,
if enthusiasm didn't count.

01:02:55.228 --> 01:02:57.429 position:24% line:83% align:start
[CHIAKI chuckles]
That's better than nothing.

01:03:02.601 --> 01:03:05.839 position:16% line:83% align:start

What're you talking about?

this is seriously whacked.

Makoto!

[CHIAKI] Actually, Makoto,
there's something

01:03:57.057 --> 01:03:58.925 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've been meaning
to ask you as well.

about my little sister.

Huh? Why?

01:04:07.368 --> 01:04:10.137 position:16% line:83% align:start

[gasps]

01:04:25.953 --> 01:04:28.823 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MAKOTO] Zero? So these
digits did represent

01:04:28.856 --> 01:04:30.992 position:21% line:83% align:start
the number of times
I could time leap.

01:04:31.025 --> 01:04:34.095 position:21% line:83% align:start

on something so lame.

01:04:34.128 --> 01:04:36.697 position:21% line:83% align:start

Kousuke wasn't hurt,

01:04:36.731 --> 01:04:37.865 position:7% line:89% align:start

I came from... the future?

01:08:32.035 --> 01:08:34.338 position:21% line:83% align:start
[CHIAKI] In my time,
a device is developed

01:08:34.371 --> 01:08:40.077 position:10% line:83% align:start
that allows people to travel
through time whenever they want.

01:08:40.110 --> 01:08:44.881 position:27% line:83% align:start
This is it here.
You use it to charge your body.

01:08:44.915 --> 01:08:48.952 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's how I came to this era,
with this device.

01:08:48.986 --> 01:08:54.057 position:7% line:83% align:start
I didn't realize it at first,
but somewhere along the way...

01:08:54.091 --> 01:08:56.460 position:30% line:89% align:start
...I lost it.

01:08:56.493 --> 01:08:59.830 position:5% line:83% align:start
I panicked. I looked everywhere
and eventually I found it.

01:08:59.863 --> 01:09:03.867 position:21% line:89% align:start
In the science lab.

01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:07.371 position:21% line:83% align:start
But by then, it was
already used up.

01:09:08.606 --> 01:09:13.844 position:5% line:83% align:start
[CHIAKI] It wasn't all bad news.
It was charged to an idiot.

01:09:13.877 --> 01:09:15.312 position:16% line:89% align:start
I had trouble sleeping,

01:09:15.346 --> 01:09:18.181 position:19% line:83% align:start
thinking it might fall
into the wrong hands.

01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:23.020 position:21% line:89% align:start
Why'd you come here?

01:09:23.053 --> 01:09:25.856 position:27% line:89% align:start
'Cause I had to.

01:09:25.889 --> 01:09:27.525 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MAKOTO]
Why though?

01:09:31.229 --> 01:09:34.898 position:7% line:83% align:start
[CHIAKI] There was a painting
I desperately wanted to see.

01:09:34.931 --> 01:09:37.235 position:7% line:89% align:start
No matter how far away it was,

01:09:37.268 --> 01:09:39.470 position:27% line:83% align:start
or what sort of
place it was in.

01:09:39.504 --> 01:09:41.838 position:13% line:89% align:start
No matter how dangerous...

01:09:44.609 --> 01:09:47.578 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CHIAKI]
...I wanted to see it.

01:09:52.383 --> 01:09:53.985 position:13% line:89% align:start
Unfortunately, in my time,

01:09:54.018 --> 01:09:55.920 position:16% line:83% align:start
the painting had already
been destroyed.

01:09:55.953 --> 01:09:59.390 position:16% line:83% align:start
And before these times,
its whereabouts was unknown.

01:09:59.424 --> 01:10:01.893 position:7% line:83% align:start
The only place where there was
an accurate record of it

01:10:01.926 --> 01:10:05.063 position:16% line:83% align:start
was in this present era,
in this place.

01:10:05.096 --> 01:10:07.398 position:10% line:89% align:start
It was here, in this season.

01:10:07.432 --> 01:10:11.402 position:5% line:89% align:start
And so you came all... this way?

01:10:11.436 --> 01:10:15.473 position:10% line:89% align:start
All I needed was to see it.

01:10:15.506 --> 01:10:19.110 position:13% line:83% align:start
I was going to remember it
for the rest of my life.

01:10:25.517 --> 01:10:29.987 position:13% line:83% align:start
[CHIAKI] Anyway... I guess
there's no point now.

01:10:30.021 --> 01:10:31.356 position:33% line:89% align:start
To anything.

01:10:33.224 --> 01:10:35.293 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MAKOTO]
Huh?

01:10:35.326 --> 01:10:38.364 position:24% line:83% align:start
You can't return?!
What's that supposed to mean?!

01:10:38.397 --> 01:10:42.334 position:10% line:83% align:start
[CHIAKI] It means just that,
I can't go back to my time.

01:10:42.368 --> 01:10:44.235 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MAKOTO]
I know, but why?!

01:10:44.269 --> 01:10:45.937 position:16% line:83% align:start
[CHIAKI] Because having
to steal your bike

01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:48.005 position:27% line:83% align:start
that Kousuke was
supposed to ride

01:10:48.039 --> 01:10:52.177 position:21% line:83% align:start
used up all the time
leaps that I had left.

01:10:52.211 --> 01:10:54.179 position:38% line:83% align:start
[gasps]
What'll you do?!

01:10:54.213 --> 01:10:56.047 position:13% line:89% align:start
There's nothing I can do.

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:57.982 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why would you use it
up for that?!

01:10:58.015 --> 01:11:00.085 position:10% line:83% align:start
Didn't you think to save it
for when you really needed it?!

01:11:00.119 --> 01:11:02.987 position:24% line:83% align:start
I did save it for
something important.

01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:05.624 position:13% line:83% align:start
You probably haven't fully
realized it yet, Makoto,

01:11:05.657 --> 01:11:08.227 position:21% line:83% align:start
but Kousuke and that
girl did die once

01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:10.462 position:16% line:89% align:start
at that train crossing.

01:11:10.496 --> 01:11:13.665 position:7% line:83% align:start
A certain someone was sobbing
and blaming herself for it,

01:11:13.699 --> 01:11:16.602 position:24% line:83% align:start
so it was the only
choice I really had.

01:11:20.005 --> 01:11:22.274 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CHIAKI]
I was supposed to go home,

01:11:22.307 --> 01:11:26.512 position:19% line:83% align:start
but before I knew it,
summer was already here.

01:11:26.545 --> 01:11:31.216 position:7% line:83% align:start
I couldn't help it. Being with
you guys was so much fun.

01:11:52.137 --> 01:11:53.338 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CHIAKI]
I saw a river flow

01:11:53.372 --> 01:11:56.008 position:21% line:83% align:start
across the land for
the first time.

01:11:56.041 --> 01:12:00.012 position:30% line:83% align:start
I rode a bike
for the first time.

01:12:00.045 --> 01:12:04.350 position:19% line:83% align:start
I discovered just how
enormous the sky is.

01:12:04.384 --> 01:12:06.985 position:16% line:89% align:start
And more than anything,

01:12:07.019 --> 01:12:12.525 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'd never seen a place
with so many people.

01:12:12.559 --> 01:12:16.128 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MAKOTO]
Hey, Chiaki?

01:12:16.162 --> 01:12:19.097 position:13% line:83% align:start
I was wondering, is there
some kind of connection

01:12:19.132 --> 01:12:21.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
between that painting
and the future...

01:12:21.301 --> 01:12:23.470 position:5% line:89% align:start
...where you come from, I mean?

01:12:28.408 --> 01:12:33.146 position:13% line:89% align:start
Please, tell me. Is there?

01:12:35.315 --> 01:12:38.551 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CHIAKI]
I really like this era.

01:12:38.585 --> 01:12:39.686 position:24% line:89% align:start
You have baseball.

01:12:39.719 --> 01:12:42.755 position:13% line:83% align:start
Huh? Baseball disappears?
For real?

01:12:42.789 --> 01:12:44.324 position:24% line:89% align:start
Over here, stupid.

01:12:44.357 --> 01:12:49.429 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MAKOTO]
Huh?! Aww, stop messin' around.

01:12:49.462 --> 01:12:50.530 position:27% line:89% align:start
That painting...

01:12:50.563 --> 01:12:51.364 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CHIAKI]
Huh?

01:12:51.397 --> 01:12:53.700 position:21% line:83% align:start
--That painting...!
--[CHIAKI] Yeah?

01:12:53.734 --> 01:12:56.402 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's not there now, but
you'll be able to see it soon.

01:12:56.436 --> 01:12:59.072 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's getting restored.
That's why it's not there.

01:12:59.105 --> 01:13:02.141 position:7% line:83% align:start
How 'bout the three of us go?
You, me, and Kousuke?

01:13:02.175 --> 01:13:04.544 position:13% line:83% align:start
Especially now that summer
vacation's about to start!

01:13:04.578 --> 01:13:08.214 position:27% line:83% align:start
What do you say,
Chiaki? Chiaki?!

01:13:08.314 --> 01:13:10.450 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sorry, I can't.

01:13:10.483 --> 01:13:11.585 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh?

01:13:11.619 --> 01:13:14.588 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CHIAKI]
As of tomorrow, I won't be here.

01:13:14.622 --> 01:13:16.790 position:38% line:83% align:start
[gasps]
How come?

01:13:16.824 --> 01:13:19.660 position:5% line:83% align:start
[CHIAKI] I'm not supposed to let
the people who live in the past

01:13:19.693 --> 01:13:22.128 position:19% line:89% align:start
know about time leaps.

01:13:22.161 --> 01:13:24.632 position:24% line:89% align:start
I broke that rule.

01:13:24.665 --> 01:13:26.634 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's why...

01:13:26.667 --> 01:13:28.802 position:24% line:83% align:start
...I won't be able
to see you again.

01:13:28.836 --> 01:13:33.274 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll keep my mouth shut!
I promise I won't tell anyone!

01:13:33.307 --> 01:13:37.244 position:16% line:89% align:start
Chiaki! Where are you?!

01:13:37.278 --> 01:13:39.647 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, Chiaki...

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:41.749 position:35% line:89% align:start
Chiaki...

01:13:41.782 --> 01:13:43.717 position:38% line:89% align:start
Chiaki!

01:13:43.751 --> 01:13:46.320 position:21% line:83% align:start
You said we'd go to
a night game together!

01:13:46.353 --> 01:13:47.354 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CHIAKI]
Sorry.

01:13:47.388 --> 01:13:50.591 position:16% line:83% align:start
And that we'd go to see
a fireworks festival!

01:13:50.624 --> 01:13:51.692 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CHIAKI]
I'm really sorry.

01:13:51.725 --> 01:13:55.796 position:16% line:83% align:start
So this means you don't
want to see me in a yukata?!

01:13:55.829 --> 01:13:59.667 position:16% line:83% align:start
[CHIAKI] Sorry, I would
liked to have seen that.

01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:01.235 position:41% line:89% align:start
Jerk!

01:14:06.574 --> 01:14:08.108 position:38% line:89% align:start
Chiaki!

01:14:09.844 --> 01:14:11.378 position:38% line:89% align:start
Chiaki!

01:14:17.384 --> 01:14:18.252 position:38% line:89% align:start
Chiaki!

01:14:18.285 --> 01:14:19.520 position:35% line:89% align:start
Uh! Wait!

01:14:19.553 --> 01:14:21.088 position:38% line:89% align:start
Chiaki!

01:14:48.215 --> 01:14:50.318 position:33% line:83% align:start
[STUDENT M]
Why is Chiaki quitting school?

01:14:50.352 --> 01:14:53.187 position:5% line:83% align:start
[STUDENT N] Apparently he was in
debt and the mob was after him.

01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:54.356 position:33% line:83% align:start
[STUDENT O]
Is that true?

01:14:54.389 --> 01:14:55.924 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's not something like his
parents getting a divorce?

01:14:55.957 --> 01:14:58.259 position:7% line:83% align:start
[STUDENT P] Well, I heard he's
marrying an older woman,

01:14:58.293 --> 01:14:59.661 position:10% line:89% align:start
because he got her pregnant.

01:14:59.694 --> 01:15:02.297 position:24% line:89% align:start
What?! Seriously!

01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:05.333 position:10% line:89% align:start
So what's the story, Makoto?

01:15:07.235 --> 01:15:08.903 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm tellin' you,
he's not that kind of guy!

01:15:08.937 --> 01:15:11.539 position:19% line:83% align:start
I heard he lost it and
stabbed some guy.

01:15:11.573 --> 01:15:13.408 position:19% line:83% align:start
I heard he beat him up
with a baseball bat.

01:15:13.441 --> 01:15:15.377 position:13% line:83% align:start
[STUDENT Q] No. He took a
knife and stabbed him.

01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:18.346 position:7% line:89% align:start
I told you he's not like that!

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:20.448 position:27% line:83% align:start
--Hey, Kousuke!
--Hey, c'mon. Come back!

01:15:20.482 --> 01:15:22.317 position:21% line:89% align:start
What's his problem?

01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:31.861 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KOUSUKE]
What the hell happened to him?

01:15:31.894 --> 01:15:33.361 position:27% line:89% align:start
[KOUSUKE sighs]

01:15:33.395 --> 01:15:36.197 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KOUSUKE]
It's one thing not to tell me,

01:15:36.231 --> 01:15:39.769 position:16% line:83% align:start
but he could've at least
talked to you about it.

01:15:39.802 --> 01:15:44.506 position:21% line:83% align:start
I mean, considering
he had a thing for you.

01:15:46.642 --> 01:15:48.476 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MAKOTO]
Did Chiaki say that?

01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:51.580 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KOUSUKE]
I thought it was obvious.

01:15:51.614 --> 01:15:53.816 position:24% line:89% align:start
Didn't you notice?

01:15:53.849 --> 01:15:57.720 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, you're awkward
with stuff like that.

01:15:57.753 --> 01:16:04.325 position:19% line:83% align:start
M-Maybe that's why he
couldn't come out with it.

01:16:04.359 --> 01:16:05.594 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MAKOTO]
Kousuke...

01:16:05.628 --> 01:16:07.262 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KOUSUKE]
Yeah?

01:16:07.295 --> 01:16:08.664 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MAKOTO]
I'm a horrible person.

01:16:08.698 --> 01:16:10.700 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:12.902 position:13% line:83% align:start
[MAKOTO] He wanted to tell
me something important,

01:16:12.935 --> 01:16:15.938 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I pretended the
conversation never happened.

01:16:15.971 --> 01:16:18.708 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why didn't I take what
he said more seriously?

01:16:18.741 --> 01:16:20.409 position:30% line:89% align:start
[MAKOTO sobs]

01:16:20.443 --> 01:16:24.814 position:27% line:83% align:start
Makoto, what are
you talkin' about?

01:16:24.847 --> 01:16:26.315 position:35% line:89% align:start
Uh! Wait!

01:16:26.348 --> 01:16:29.685 position:27% line:89% align:start

[KAZUKO]
Feel any better?

01:17:10.961 --> 01:17:14.296 position:13% line:83% align:start
You know what, I honestly
thought you were just friends

01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:17.399 position:7% line:89% align:start
with both Kousuke and Chiaki.

01:17:23.039 --> 01:17:25.742 position:19% line:83% align:start
To tell you the truth,
I figured you would graduate

01:17:25.776 --> 01:17:27.444 position:30% line:83% align:start
without dating
either one of them,

01:17:27.477 --> 01:17:31.047 position:19% line:83% align:start
and you'd end up going
out with someone else entirely.

01:17:31.081 --> 01:17:34.551 position:19% line:83% align:start
[MAKOTO] That's what I
thought too, until yesterday.

01:17:34.584 --> 01:17:38.421 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAZUKO]
But that's not how it is, right?

01:17:42.926 --> 01:17:47.564 position:10% line:83% align:start
I fell in love for the first
time when I was in senior high.

01:17:47.597 --> 01:17:49.833 position:21% line:83% align:start
We hit it off right
from the start.

01:17:49.866 --> 01:17:53.870 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was as if we'd known
each other all our lives.

01:17:53.904 --> 01:17:56.840 position:19% line:83% align:start
But it all fell apart
before we grew up.

01:17:59.910 --> 01:18:01.444 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MAKOTO]
Why?

01:18:02.479 --> 01:18:06.349 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KAZUKO] I don't know.
Bad timing, I guess.

01:18:06.383 --> 01:18:09.020 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MAKOTO]
What's he doing now?

01:18:10.121 --> 01:18:12.890 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAZUKO]
I couldn't tell you.

01:18:12.924 --> 01:18:15.458 position:5% line:89% align:start
He promised to come back for me.

01:18:15.492 --> 01:18:18.029 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wasn't planning to
wait for him, but...

01:18:18.062 --> 01:18:21.999 position:19% line:83% align:start
Anyway, so many years
have passed now.

01:18:22.033 --> 01:18:27.905 position:13% line:83% align:start
It didn't seem very long.
Time flew by fast.

01:18:29.841 --> 01:18:31.042 position:38% line:83% align:start

But, Makoto.

Hm?

01:18:32.210 --> 01:18:36.881 position:5% line:83% align:start

like me at all, are you?

meeting up with you,

01:18:44.021 --> 01:18:47.058 position:27% line:83% align:start
you're the type

What's up with her?

no watermelon?

He looks a bit rough,

Hey, did you hear that?

you say? Wanna go out?

01:21:28.855 --> 01:21:29.989 position:24% line:83% align:start
You were wondering
what it'd be like

01:21:30.023 --> 01:21:32.025 position:10% line:89% align:start
if Kousuke got a girlfriend.

Are you okay?

01:22:27.314 --> 01:22:30.683 position:10% line:83% align:start

does on the weekends and stuff.

01:22:30.716 --> 01:22:34.654 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm sure he doesn't play

I haven't been able to tell you.

[YURI]
Yeah? What is it?

01:22:47.835 --> 01:22:50.804 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's Chiaki. I really like him.

A lot.

01:22:54.241 --> 01:22:56.844 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

01:23:00.314 --> 01:23:04.384 position:13% line:89% align:start
I see. I kinda thought so.

01:23:04.419 --> 01:23:09.723 position:7% line:83% align:start

here. You should go to him.

Kousuke, where's Chiaki?

01:23:27.142 --> 01:23:28.243 position:35% line:83% align:start
[KOUSUKE]
He got tired of waiting

01:23:28.276 --> 01:23:29.977 position:10% line:89% align:start
and went ahead to the field.

01:23:30.010 --> 01:23:32.913 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's pretty cranky.
We'd better hurry.

You sure you wanna leave
your girlfriend alone?

After all I did--

Oh, right. It's all
gone back to before...

to yourself about?

all about anyway?

Ask them nicely, "Would you
like to play ball with us?"

01:24:17.892 --> 01:24:20.228 position:35% line:89% align:start
