1
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:10,571
[Narrator]
They call it the Dragon Age‐‐

2
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,773
a time of political strife,

3
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:15,441
savage beasts and
powerful magic‐‐

4
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:17,811
but also a time of faith‐‐

5
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:21,147
faith in the Chantry
of Andraste,

6
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:25,886
a dominant religious order led
by her holiness, the Divine...

7
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:29,756
Her Templar knights exert
harsh control over the Mages,

8
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,659
restricting the practice of
the arcane magical arts

9
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,860
they believe have the potential

10
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,697
to unleash a blight
upon the world...

11
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:40,300
The most dangerous of these are
the Blood Mages who continue

12
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,903
to perform their
dark rituals in secret...

13
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:45,371
in defiance of the Chantry.

14
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:48,408
Determined to neutralize
this threat at any cost,

15
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,677
the Templar's methods
become more brutal

16
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,646
and their suspicions rise,

17
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:56,550
even extending to
the loyal Circle of Magi...

18
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,885
Corruption infects
the Templar ranks

19
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,387
as the leadership
sees their role shift

20
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:04,591
from control and protection...
to suppression.

21
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,893
As tensions boil
within the Chantry,

22
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,229
the balance of power
has been maintained

23
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,399
by the Seekers, the finest
and most loyal of the Templars.

24
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:16,302
Handpicked by
the Divine herself...

25
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,405
...these defenders of
truth root out corruption,

26
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,207
wherever it may be found,

27
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:22,643
be it from rogue Mages,

28
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,679
or within the halls
of the Chantry itself.

29
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:28,915
Now the "Ten Year Gathering
of the Faithful" looms,

30
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,818
and pilgrims from all
corners of the world

31
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,655
journey to the Orlaisian
Empire to pray for peace...

32
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:39,693
A peace that those in the
shadows are plotting to shatter.

33
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:52,438
[bird hooting and
crickets chirping]

34
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:57,477
[drum beat]

35
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,578
[dragon growls]

36
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,585
[dragon roars]

37
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,523
[dragon roars]

38
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:49,429
[dragon roars]

39
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:55,736
[dragon roars in pain]

40
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,780
Brothers!

41
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,885
A new era for Mages
everywhere is about to begin!

42
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:16,056
[Blood Mages cheer]

43
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,958
[dragon roars]

44
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:24,831
[Frenic] Now, Avexis, the time
has come to join our cause.

45
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:41,948
[Avexis struggles, gulps]

46
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,817
[Avexis grunts]

47
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:46,419
[Avexis cries sharply]

48
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:50,356
[Avexis pants]

49
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:08,074
[Byron] Keep your focus,
Cassandra.

50
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:11,044
Don't let your fury run
away with you again.

51
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,781
I know, Byron.

52
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,883
Trust in the Maker.

53
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,759
[Avexis takes a breath]

54
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,962
[Frenic] It's useless
to resist, Avexis.

55
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,798
Drink.. Drink your destiny...

56
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,499
[Blood Mage] Brother Frenic...

57
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,036
If she drinks any more,
it will kill her...

58
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,472
[Blood Mage chokes]

59
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,843
I will decide when she's had
enough. Is that understood?!

60
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:48,381
[battle cries from the Seekers]

61
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,116
[Byron] For the Chantry!

62
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:53,419
[Seekers] For the Chantry!

63
00:05:56,923 --> 00:06:00,060
[Seekers yell]

64
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,031
[Cassandra breathes heavily]

65
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,004
[Cassandra] Ha!

66
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:36,730
[Seekers and Blood Mages
grunt, struggle]

67
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,935
[Frenic snarls]

68
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,571
[Frenic] Now, release it!

69
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,043
[dragon growls]

70
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,679
[dragon roars]

71
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:01,888
[Cassandra yells repeatedly]

72
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,458
[Byron] Enough, Cassandra!
Gather your wits.

73
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,092
We have work to do.

74
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,863
[dragon growls]

75
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,665
[dragon roars]

76
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:14,701
[Byron] I'll draw its eye.
Don't keep me waiting!

77
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,572
[Byron] Hey!

78
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:22,509
That's right! Come on!
Come and get me!

79
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,811
[dragon roars]

80
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,119
[Cassandra yells]

81
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:40,193
[dragon roars in pain]

82
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,100
[Cassandra yells]

83
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,540
[Seeker D] There's
nowhere left to run, Mage.

84
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,842
[Seeker E]
Release the girl and submit!

85
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,781
[Cassandra] Make way!

86
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:09,823
You're from one of the
dragon‐hunting clans.

87
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,992
It seems I'm outmatched...

88
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,835
Spineless Blood Mage!

89
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,166
You may rise.

90
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,605
[Divine] We applaud your
recent efforts, High Seeker.

91
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:02,876
However, your report
also raises many concerns.

92
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,211
To think this is all
happening so close

93
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,614
to the Ten Year Gathering...

94
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:10,817
Surely it is not a coincidence.

95
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:15,321
We're already taking
extra precautions, Most Holy.

96
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:18,258
So you managed to bring back
a little Blood Mage girl?

97
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,963
Avexis is not a Blood Mage,
Your Grace.

98
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,999
She was taken from
the Circle of Magi.

99
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,369
[First Enchanter] It's true.

100
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:32,606
She went missing from
the Circle a few weeks ago.

101
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:36,810
Presumably kidnapped. We've
been searching for her since.

102
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,347
I am most grateful for
her rescue, High Seeker.

103
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,650
We will come for her soon.

104
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,854
I'm afraid I cannot allow that,
First Enchanter.

105
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:50,090
And why not?

106
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,793
[High Seeker] She was
the focus of the ritual,

107
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,194
and is obviously vital

108
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,930
to whatever the Blood
Mages are planning.

109
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,165
She will remain in my custody

110
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:02,035
until we get to
the bottom of this.

111
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:10,677
Did the Seekers really
bring down a drake?

112
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:14,247
Yes, Your Reverence.
It was Cassandra.

113
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,919
[Divine] You are to be commended
for your exceptional bravery.

114
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,254
I would expect nothing
less from a Pentaghast.

115
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:24,057
Your family's dragon‐hunting
skills are legendary.

116
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:31,364
You honor us, Grand Cleric. We
are proud to serve the Chantry.

117
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,934
[Knight Commander, clapping]
You have my praise as well,

118
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,401
High Seeker.

119
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:40,140
Another notable success
by your loyal order.

120
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:44,110
However, it seems
rather reckless

121
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,882
to risk your small numbers
against Blood Mage ceremonies.

122
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:51,117
Perhaps if you shared
your intelligence,

123
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:54,220
my Templars could
better assist you.

124
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,257
There are times when stealth

125
00:10:57,257 --> 00:11:01,227
and discretion are more
valuable than numbers.

126
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,966
Are you implying you don't
trust us to act with discretion?

127
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:09,369
Ensuring that you do
is one of our duties.

128
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,437
Or have you forgotten,
Knight Commander?

129
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,875
Gentlemen,
remember where you are.

130
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,846
My deepest apologies,
Your Holiness.

131
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,047
With your permission,

132
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,918
we shall take our leave and
return to our investigation.

133
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:36,262
[Cassandra grunts repeatedly]

134
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:51,344
[Cassandra pants]

135
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:55,215
[Byron] Such violence before
bed will give you nightmares.

136
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,193
Let's see what you've got!

137
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:13,900
[Cassandra and Byron
grunt repeatedly]

138
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:39,760
[Cassandra and Byron
grunt repeatedly]

139
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:48,268
[Cassandra and
Byron breathe heavily]

140
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:00,947
[Byron] There's nothing left for
me to teach you about swordplay.

141
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,884
I know no man tougher
than you with a blade.

142
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:06,587
[Cassandra, with a laugh]
But you just bested me.

143
00:13:06,587 --> 00:13:08,321
Yes, but you weren't fighting

144
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,557
with everything you
have, were you?

145
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:13,259
[Cassandra] Perhaps, but you had
me completely at your mercy

146
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:16,096
with that final move.

147
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:18,865
Sometimes your blade
becomes your shield

148
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:21,334
and your shield
becomes your blade.

149
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:27,073
Your prejudice misleads
your judgment, Cassandra.

150
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:30,911
To see the truth, you must look
through the eyes of your heart,

151
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:33,213
and not just the
ones in your head.

152
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:36,583
Not everything is what it
appears on the surface.

153
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,987
[laughing] Sorry, I must sound

154
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,890
just like a father
lecturing his child.

155
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,392
I'd be proud to have
you as a father.

156
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,263
Good night, Byron.

157
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:10,617
[Frenic] One of the
Circle of Magi dogs

158
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:13,219
was able to sniff
out our ritual.

159
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,557
However, its purpose
still eludes them.

160
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:22,028
As long as we get Avexis back,
we can proceed as planned.

161
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:26,332
It's far too dangerous to
continue meeting like this.

162
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:31,972
[Frenic] Here.
This is a rare Elven Stone

163
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:34,340
you can use
to communicate with me.

164
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,910
Keep it on your
person at all times.

165
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,245
Should you discover any
more useful information,

166
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:43,149
my Mages and
I will be ready to act.

167
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:46,653
Victory will be ours.

168
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,522
[Frenic chuckles]

169
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:59,900

00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:06,406
[Cassandra gasps]

171
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,250
[Byron gasps]

172
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,686
[Cassandra]
Byron! What are you doing?

173
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:54,487
There's no time to explain.

174
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,657
Go back to your quarters and
forget what you've seen here.

175
00:15:56,657 --> 00:15:59,325
That's not what you
trained me to do.

176
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:03,263
[Byron] I trained you
to follow orders. Now go!

177
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:04,965
Byron!

178
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,242
[Cassandra]
Tell me where you're taking her.

179
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:18,111
I can't say.

180
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:20,213
I'm on an important mission.

181
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,748
[Cassandra] What is it?

182
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:24,217
I don't want to involve
you in this.

183
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,323
[Seeker] Raise the alarm! Men
down! There's been an intruder!

184
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,693
[Seekers]
‐‐Someone has taken the girl!
‐‐Search the grounds!

185
00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:35,195
‐‐Find her!
‐‐They can't have gotten far!

186
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,232
[Byron] Come on.

187
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:05,291
[Byron pants]

188
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,401
[Seeker B2] Byron and Cassandra
have taken the girl!

189
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,604
[Seeker A] Inform
the High Seeker.

190
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:20,306
The rest of you, follow me!

191
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:23,109
[Seekers] Hya!

192
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,685
[Byron pants]

193
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:34,621
[Cassandra pants]

194
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,331
[Byron] We'll wait here.

195
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:52,806
For what?

196
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:55,341
Byron!

197
00:17:55,341 --> 00:18:00,180
[Byron] Yes... I suppose
you're a part of this now...

198
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,448
I don't know all
the details yet,

199
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:05,451
but I've been
investigating a conspiracy.

200
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:08,855
That's how I found out about
the Blood Mage ceremony.

201
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:13,259
Is the High Seeker
aware of this?

202
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:18,431
No... I fear the conspiracy goes
all the way to the Chantry.

203
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,467
And you suspect
the High Seeker?!

204
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:25,205
I'm a Seeker.
I'm trained to suspect everyone.

205
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:27,708
[Cassandra] Do you even know
what you are suggesting?!

206
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,277
To doubt the High Seeker is...

207
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,880
[Cassandra sighs]

208
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,382
[Byron] This elf girl
supposedly has the ability

209
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:37,918
to control wild beasts.

210
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:40,587
That's why the
Blood Mages wanted her.

211
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:42,589
[Cassandra]
That's a rare power,

212
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,758
but what does it have to
do with the conspiracy?

213
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:46,459
I don't know yet.

214
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,929
But I'm convinced
she's the key to all of it.

215
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:50,831
[Cassandra] And because
the High Seeker refused

216
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:53,800
to return her to the Circle,
you think that means...?

217
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,571
[Byron] I'm not sure what
to think about any of it!

218
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:01,207
For now, I'm taking Avexis
to a friend I know I can trust.

219
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:04,911
Who? Tell me!

220
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:07,614
[Byron and Cassandra gasp]

221
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:12,653
[birds caw]

222
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:35,942
Are these the friends
you were waiting for?

223
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:39,312
[Byron] We can't take on these
numbers and protect the girl.

224
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:41,347
We must retreat.

225
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,453
[Cassandra] Go!

226
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:48,989
Cassandra, wait!

227
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:51,457
[Cassandra pants]

228
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:52,458

[Cassandra struggles]

234
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:27,227
[Byron] Behind you!

235
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:29,963
Byron!

236
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:36,537
[Byron wheezes]

237
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:41,474
[Frenic] I'll be taking
what is mine, Seeker.

238
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:44,711
[Byron] No... Avexis...

239
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:48,048
[Cassandra and Blood Mage grunt]

240
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:50,450
[Cassandra yells]

241
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,919
[Cassandra] Release her! Now!

242
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:57,624
[Blood Mage] Seeker
reinforcements are approaching.

243
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:59,425
[Frenic groans]

244
00:21:00,861 --> 00:21:04,497
[Frenic] Your comrades are
too late, Dragon Hunter...

245
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:09,670
[Frenic] This round...
belongs to me...

246
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:13,974
[Cassandra gasps]

247
00:21:13,974 --> 00:21:15,308
Byron!

[Byron grunts in pain]

249
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,388
Go after them...

250
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:30,724
We must get Avexis back...

251
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:32,726
The Chantry is in peril...

252
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:35,061
I should have listened to you...

253
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:38,398
Cassandra...

254
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:44,505
Hate can only breed more hate...

255
00:21:46,106 --> 00:21:47,440
[Cassandra shudders]

256
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,942
Byron!

I‐I'm not the one you want!

[Cassandra yells]

263
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:23,143
[Galyan trembles]

264
00:22:23,143 --> 00:22:26,112
[Cassandra] Where did your
accomplices take Avexis?!

265
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:28,915
Stop! You have the wrong person!

266
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:30,483
Silence, Blood Mage!

267
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:31,985
[Galyan yelps]

268
00:22:31,985 --> 00:22:34,555
[Galyan] No, I'm a Circle Mage,
not a Blood Mage!

269
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:36,823
A Mage is a Mage!

270
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:46,600
[Galyan breathes]

271
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:50,704
[Seeker A] There they are!

272
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:54,575
Stand down! Lower your
weapon, Cassandra!

273
00:22:57,911 --> 00:23:00,614
[Seeker A] You have
some explaining to do.

274
00:23:00,614 --> 00:23:02,015
[Seeker C] He's dead!

275
00:23:02,015 --> 00:23:04,518
[Seeker A]
What?! What happened here? Talk!

276
00:23:04,518 --> 00:23:06,787
These Blood Mages killed Byron.

277
00:23:06,787 --> 00:23:09,523
I'm telling you, I had no
part in this, I swear it!

278
00:23:09,523 --> 00:23:10,924
[Seeker B2] Where's the girl?

279
00:23:10,924 --> 00:23:11,925
They took her.

280
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:13,894
[Seeker A] Or perhaps
you gave her to them!

281
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:17,497
Why did you and Byron
remove her from her guard?

282
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:19,132
Talk, Cassandra!

283
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:21,467
[Seeker A] So be it.

284
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:24,070
Take her into custody!
And the Mage as well!

285
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,507
What?!

286
00:23:26,507 --> 00:23:28,909
Listen, we have to get Avexis
back as soon as possible.

287
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:30,577
The Chantry's in danger!

288
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:33,847
[Seeker A] You had your chance.
Save it for the High Seeker.

289
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:49,896
Byron came here to meet me.

290
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:52,699
I promised him that I'd
take Avexis to a safe place.

291
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:00,473
There's no way
those Blood Mages

292
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:02,208
could've known to follow
you here tonight.

293
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,477
Not without spies on the inside.

294
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:10,216
Byron suspected that
someone within the Chantry

295
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:12,218
is behind a conspiracy.

296
00:24:12,218 --> 00:24:14,621
If he was right, and we let
these Seekers take us back,

297
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:17,558
there's a good chance
we will be "silenced."

298
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:19,192
Shut up, Mage!

299
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:20,994
[Seeker A] There a problem?

300
00:24:22,863 --> 00:24:24,998
[Seeker A]
Keep it down back there.

301
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:31,572
Circle Mages have pledged
their allegiance to the Chantry.

302
00:24:31,572 --> 00:24:33,974
It's Blood Mages
who are the opposition.

303
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:35,676
Please don't assume
I'm one of them,

304
00:24:35,676 --> 00:24:38,478
but I can find out
where they are.

305
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:44,150
You said yourself that if
we don't get Avexis back,

306
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,588
something terrible will happen.

307
00:24:47,588 --> 00:24:50,524
And Byron will have then
lost his life for nothing.

308
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,630
Are you sure you know
a way to find Avexis?

309
00:25:04,705 --> 00:25:07,774
Byron risked defying
our Order to protect her.

310
00:25:07,774 --> 00:25:09,943
It seems that if I am
to discover the truth,

311
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:11,978
I will have to do the same.

312
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,585
This man has a knife!

313
00:25:18,585 --> 00:25:20,286
What?!

314
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:23,824
[Seekers]
‐‐Hm?
‐‐What's going on over there?

315
00:25:23,824 --> 00:25:28,294
We told you to surrender your
weapons, Mage. Where is it?!

316
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:30,631
No sudden moves! Search him!

317
00:25:30,631 --> 00:25:33,700

00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,865
Wait! They aren't pursuing us.

324
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:08,334
You're pathetic!

325
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:10,103
[Galyan cries out]

326
00:26:10,103 --> 00:26:11,104
[Cassandra] Whoa!

327
00:26:11,104 --> 00:26:13,640
[Cassandra and Galyan grunt]

328
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:17,844
Get off of me!

329
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,848
Prefer the top, do you?

330
00:26:21,848 --> 00:26:23,617
[Galyan] Ah! Ah...

331
00:26:23,617 --> 00:26:25,318
[Cassandra] Shut up!

332
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:30,290
[Galyan breathes lightly]

333
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,625
[Galyan] No! Wait!

334
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:33,694
[Cassandra grunts]

335
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:38,264
If you were of no use to me, I'd
cut you down here and now, Mage.

336
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,076
But I forget my manners.

337
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:52,245
Here I've rolled in the bushes
with a pretty young lady

338
00:26:52,245 --> 00:26:55,248
and I haven't
introduced myself.

339
00:26:55,248 --> 00:26:57,684
I am Regalyan d'Marcall.

340
00:26:57,684 --> 00:26:59,753
My friends call me Galyan.

341
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:09,029
[Cassandra] Well, "friend"...

342
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:12,933
If you value your life,

343
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:16,870
you will take me to the Blood
Mage that murdered Byron.

344
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,772
[Galyan inhales anxiously]

345
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:25,045
[High Seeker] That is all we
know at this time, Most Holy.

346
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:28,649
This is unbelievable...

347
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:32,986
A traitor amongst the Seekers?

348
00:27:34,054 --> 00:27:37,423
We are currently reviewing
all the facts, Your Reverence.

349
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:39,125
It's unthinkable!

350
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:41,194
The Seekers are the
most pure among us,

351
00:27:41,194 --> 00:27:44,731
yet two of your own have
betrayed the Chantry.

352
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:47,901
A Seeker would never
go against the Chantry.

353
00:27:47,901 --> 00:27:51,705
I assure you that their
actions can be explained.

354
00:27:53,206 --> 00:27:54,474
[Knight Commander]
I have a company of knights

355
00:27:54,474 --> 00:27:57,110
standing at the ready.

356
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:00,681
Permission to pursue the
traitors at once, Your Eminence.

357
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:03,784
Perhaps the Seekers
would be hesitant

358
00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:06,119
to hunt down one of their own.

359
00:28:11,491 --> 00:28:14,961
Dispatch your
Templars immediately.

360
00:28:14,961 --> 00:28:18,765
These renegades must
be brought to justice.

361
00:28:18,765 --> 00:28:20,200
[Knight Commander laughs softly]

362
00:28:31,912 --> 00:28:34,247
[Galyan] There.

363
00:28:34,247 --> 00:28:36,482
Is this the Blood Mage hideout?

364
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:39,119
No, that's a Circle safe house.

365
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:44,457
[Cassandra] A trap?!

366
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:47,761
Will you quit waving
that thing around?

367
00:28:49,863 --> 00:28:52,533
My intelligence‐gathering
associates meet here.

368
00:28:52,533 --> 00:28:55,301
If anyone can find where
the Blood Mages are, they can.

369
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:57,370
More Mages just
mean more trouble!

370
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,372
You expect me to trust you?!

371
00:28:59,372 --> 00:29:02,108
[Galyan sighs]
Well, Byron trusted me!

372
00:29:05,045 --> 00:29:06,980
Byron and I were friends.

373
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,948
I was the one who told him

374
00:29:07,948 --> 00:29:10,751
where the Blood Mage
ceremony would be held.

375
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:13,253
[Galyan] The First
Enchanter sent me

376
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:16,422
to investigate suspicious
Blood Mage activities.

377
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:17,991
It's thanks to the
intelligence we gathered

378
00:29:17,991 --> 00:29:20,827
that Byron was able
to rescue Avexis.

379
00:29:20,827 --> 00:29:22,195
However, the plan fell apart

380
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:25,932
when the High Seeker did
not return her to the Circle.

381
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:30,537
I'm not sure the
reason behind it,

382
00:29:30,537 --> 00:29:32,405
but that was when
Byron started to question

383
00:29:32,405 --> 00:29:35,375
the High Seeker's
true intentions.

384
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:37,978
So Byron brought Avexis
into the forest tonight

385
00:29:37,978 --> 00:29:39,412
to give her to you...

386
00:29:39,412 --> 00:29:42,215
Yes. She is a
uniquely gifted girl.

387
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:44,918
That's why I think the
Blood Mages abducted her.

388
00:29:44,918 --> 00:29:47,220
Byron and I planned on
hiding her here to keep her safe

389
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,323
until we could get to the
bottom of the conspiracy.

390
00:29:50,323 --> 00:29:53,226
[Galyan] What?

391
00:29:53,226 --> 00:29:55,461
The horses are uneasy.

392
00:30:21,054 --> 00:30:24,124
[Cassandra gasps]

393
00:30:27,193 --> 00:30:29,162
[Galyan] By the Maker...

394
00:30:35,902 --> 00:30:39,472
[Cassandra] You knew these men?

395
00:30:39,472 --> 00:30:41,374
Loki...

396
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:59,359
[Haydi coughs, wheezes]

397
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,994
Haydi!

398
00:31:02,395 --> 00:31:05,331
[Galyan] What happened?
Who did this?!

399
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:07,668
Blood Mages...

400
00:31:07,668 --> 00:31:13,273
They caught us just as we
returned from Lazarro's...

401
00:31:13,273 --> 00:31:14,975
[Haydi exhales harshly]

402
00:31:14,975 --> 00:31:16,442
Haydi!

403
00:31:20,647 --> 00:31:22,883
[Galyan] Be at peace,
my friend...

404
00:31:24,317 --> 00:31:26,086
[Cassandra] Who's Lazarro?

405
00:31:29,255 --> 00:31:30,490
An information trader

406
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,993
from a village just
outside of Montfort.

407
00:31:32,993 --> 00:31:35,529
He's the one who told me
about the dragon ceremony.

408
00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:37,197
Take me to him.

409
00:31:41,668 --> 00:31:44,137
We'll find out
everything he knows!

410
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:48,374
The Blood Mages may already
be waiting for us, you know.

411
00:31:50,443 --> 00:31:53,279
[Galyan] They've been one
step ahead of us this far.

412
00:31:55,315 --> 00:31:56,983
[Cassandra shouts] Hyah!

413
00:31:58,685 --> 00:32:00,420
[Cassandra] Be ready.

414
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:07,293
[Cassandra] You work close
to the edge of Chantry law,

415
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:09,696
but still claim you are
loyal to the Circle?

416
00:32:09,696 --> 00:32:10,731
[Galyan] Contrary
to common belief,

417
00:32:10,731 --> 00:32:13,567
not all Mages wish to see
the Chantry deposed.

418
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:14,735
Those of us within the Circle

419
00:32:14,735 --> 00:32:18,071
seek only to be treated with
equal dignity and respect.

420
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:20,974
I do my part to help ensure our
efforts are not undermined

421
00:32:20,974 --> 00:32:22,308
by the actions of a few.

422
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:24,344
[Cassandra]
So you formed a network

423
00:32:24,344 --> 00:32:26,379
to keep tabs on rogue Mages?

424
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:27,380
[Galyan] Apostates

425
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,015
like those in this blood
cult we're dealing with

426
00:32:29,015 --> 00:32:31,017
might claim to act in
the cause of freedom,

427
00:32:31,017 --> 00:32:34,320
but more often their only aim
is seizing power for themselves.

428
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,289
[Cassandra] I'd think it
would benefit the Circle

429
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:37,758
to have Mages in power.

430
00:32:37,758 --> 00:32:41,394
[Galyan] Not like these. That
wouldn't be good for anyone.

431
00:32:43,396 --> 00:32:49,069
[footsteps running]

432
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:51,171
[Seeker] Search teams one
and two have reported in.

433
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:52,606
There's been no
sign of Cassandra

434
00:32:52,606 --> 00:32:55,408
or the Mage in the
Igrecia Forest, sir.

435
00:33:02,248 --> 00:33:04,350
[First Enchanter] Has there
been any word from Galyan?

436
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,520
[Alte]
I'm afraid not, First Enchanter.

437
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,387
[First Enchanter]
We must find him

438
00:33:07,387 --> 00:33:10,390
before the Seekers
or Templars do...

439
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,726
[Alte] Understood. I will take
charge of the search myself.

440
00:33:12,726 --> 00:33:15,128
I leave it to you, then.

441
00:33:15,128 --> 00:33:17,998
[First Enchanter]
I only pray we are not too late.

442
00:33:30,777 --> 00:33:31,778
[Galyan]
You can't see it from here,

443
00:33:31,778 --> 00:33:35,181
but Lazarro's house is
halfway up this cliff.

444
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:39,119
He's an elf recluse.
Half‐mad, but he hears things.

445
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:42,055
No one knows how.

446
00:33:42,055 --> 00:33:44,224
He's also quite paranoid.

447
00:33:44,224 --> 00:33:46,627
How can we get in?

448
00:33:46,627 --> 00:33:49,796
Well, you could always try
asking to send down a ladder.

449
00:34:14,655 --> 00:34:16,657
Lazarro!

450
00:34:16,657 --> 00:34:18,358
It's me, Galyan!

451
00:34:19,826 --> 00:34:22,228
Lazarro! Are you there?

452
00:34:35,842 --> 00:34:38,244
[Lazarro screams]

453
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:41,481
[Lazarro and Cassandra grunt]

454
00:34:43,216 --> 00:34:44,751
Lazarro, calm down!

455
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:46,520
We just need some information!

456
00:34:48,722 --> 00:34:52,626
[Lazarro shudders]

457
00:34:52,626 --> 00:34:55,195
If you cooperate and
tell us what you know,

458
00:34:55,195 --> 00:34:57,564
I'll let you keep
your filthy head!

459
00:34:57,564 --> 00:35:00,567
I know nothing!
I'm not involved!

460
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:02,903
Cassandra! Please...

461
00:35:02,903 --> 00:35:05,438
[Lazarro whimpers softly]

462
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:07,207
Where's the girl?

463
00:35:07,207 --> 00:35:09,342
What? What girl?

464
00:35:09,342 --> 00:35:13,714
Perhaps you can't hear well.
Let me clear your ears for you.

465
00:35:13,714 --> 00:35:15,381
[Lazarro screams]

466
00:35:15,381 --> 00:35:17,417
Frenic! Frenic has her!

467
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:18,351
Who's Frenic?

468
00:35:18,351 --> 00:35:20,320
[Lazarro] The leader
of the Blood Mages.

469
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,455
He needs her...
Needs her power!

470
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:24,558
For what? What is
he planning to do?!

471
00:35:25,892 --> 00:35:30,430
[Lazarro] Attack...
T‐Ten Year...

472
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:33,266
Frenic is going to attack
the Ten Year Gathering?

473
00:35:33,266 --> 00:35:35,602
Who is his accomplice
in the Chantry?

474
00:35:35,602 --> 00:35:36,803
Someone high up...!

475
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:38,438
What's their name?

476
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:41,307
‐‐I don't know!
‐‐Who is it?! Talk!

477
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:42,475
[Lazarro screams]

478
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:45,178
[Cassandra] I am only going
to ask you one more time.

479
00:35:45,178 --> 00:35:48,815
Give me the name. Now!

480
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:50,517
[Galyan] No, you don't!

481
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:54,521
This is a vial of
Nesium Suspension.

482
00:35:54,521 --> 00:35:56,590
It emits a bright flash
when shattered.

483
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,662
So you think you can escape
using mere parlor tricks?!

484
00:36:01,662 --> 00:36:03,530
They'll kill me!

485
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,431
"They"? You mean
the Blood Mages?

486
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:07,868
I was to alert them
if you showed up!

487
00:36:07,868 --> 00:36:10,771
Sorry, we can't let you do that.

488
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:12,573
It's too late.

489
00:36:12,573 --> 00:36:19,245
[rumbling and creaking]

490
00:36:19,245 --> 00:36:21,815
[Cassandra] What is that?

491
00:36:21,815 --> 00:36:24,217
[Galyan] I'm not
sure I want to know...

492
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:35,662
[Ogre roars]

493

[Ogre roars]

497
00:36:52,345 --> 00:36:53,346
[Cassandra] Hya!

498
00:36:53,346 --> 00:37:00,587
[Ogre roars]

499
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:29,783
[Galyan and Cassandra cough]

500
00:37:29,783 --> 00:37:30,784
[Galyan] You all right?

501
00:37:30,784 --> 00:37:32,452
[Cassandra] Of course I am.

502
00:37:32,452 --> 00:37:34,287
[Galyan chuckles]

503
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:48,569
[Ogres and Golems growl]

504
00:37:51,004 --> 00:37:52,906
Oh, sod!

505
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:57,343
[Galyan] The eyes... Their
minds are being controlled.

506
00:37:58,712 --> 00:38:01,915
[Ogre roars]

507
00:38:08,321 --> 00:38:13,994
[Cassandra yells repeatedly]

508
00:38:18,832 --> 00:38:21,735
[Ogre screams]

509
00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:29,342
There's too many!

510
00:38:39,452 --> 00:38:41,522
[Ogre roars]

511
00:38:51,031 --> 00:38:56,102
[Ogre roars]

512
00:39:00,941 --> 00:39:03,777
[Ogre roars]

513
00:39:03,777 --> 00:39:05,478
[Galyan] Yah!

514
00:39:10,584 --> 00:39:12,485
Not good...

515
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:17,157
Thanks, Lazarro.

516
00:39:17,157 --> 00:39:19,125
Now... let's just hope

517
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:21,528
this is actually more
than a parlor trick!

518
00:39:25,566 --> 00:39:31,538
[indistinct roars,
gradually dying away]

519
00:39:45,151 --> 00:39:48,488
I should be able
to handle this pain!

520
00:39:48,488 --> 00:39:51,124
We need to get to a safe place
where I can treat your wound.

521
00:39:51,124 --> 00:39:53,426
I don't need your magic...!

522
00:39:54,695 --> 00:39:56,162
Are you all right?

523
00:39:59,866 --> 00:40:01,668
Sorry...

524
00:40:06,472 --> 00:40:10,611
It's hard for me to admit
I'm in your debt, Mage.

525
00:40:10,611 --> 00:40:13,847
My name isn't "Mage."
It's Galyan.

526
00:40:16,883 --> 00:40:17,884
[Knight Commander]
There they are!

527
00:40:17,884 --> 00:40:19,953
[Cassandra and Galyan gasp]

528
00:40:26,459 --> 00:40:28,461
Why are you here?!

529
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,363
Hm.

530
00:40:30,363 --> 00:40:33,033
After them!
Arrest those traitors!

531
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:40,206
[Templars] Whoa!

532
00:40:43,476 --> 00:40:45,612
[Knight Commander]
Get up! Don't let them escape!

533
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:50,784
[Cassandra and Galyan
struggle and pant]

534
00:40:53,687 --> 00:40:58,725
[Cassandra and Galyan
struggle and pant]

535
00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:04,497
[Galyan] Oh, my.

536
00:41:04,497 --> 00:41:05,699
[sound of horses approaching]

537
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:07,834
[Knight Commander]
There's nowhere to run!

538
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,644
Now surrender. Nice and easy.

539
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:20,914
[Galyan] It seems we're
out of options here...

540
00:41:20,914 --> 00:41:22,949
[Cassandra] Not entirely...

541
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:24,985
We can make it.

542
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:26,687
[Galyan shudders]

543
00:41:26,687 --> 00:41:30,724
Don't be a fool.
You'll never survive the jump.

544
00:41:30,724 --> 00:41:33,527
That's for the Maker to decide.

545
00:41:33,527 --> 00:41:35,261
Not a Templar!

546
00:41:39,733 --> 00:41:41,568
[Cassandra] Get ready.

547
00:41:41,568 --> 00:41:44,571
Don't I get a say in this?

548
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:45,572
[Cassandra grunts]

549
00:41:45,572 --> 00:41:51,011
[Galyan screams]

550
00:41:51,011 --> 00:41:53,246
[distant splash]

551
00:41:56,983 --> 00:41:58,885
[Knight Commander sneers]

552
00:42:05,759 --> 00:42:08,829
[Galyan coughs]

553
00:42:14,901 --> 00:42:18,905
[Galyan] If I hadn't been here,
you would have been fish food.

554
00:42:34,087 --> 00:42:38,825
[footsteps]

555
00:42:38,825 --> 00:42:40,727
Preparations for the
Ten Year Gathering

556
00:42:40,727 --> 00:42:43,063
are proceeding without delay.

557
00:42:45,365 --> 00:42:48,902
[Divine] You have done
a superb job, as always.

558
00:42:48,902 --> 00:42:49,903
I shudder to think

559
00:42:49,903 --> 00:42:53,907
what I would do without
your selfless service.

560
00:42:53,907 --> 00:42:56,076
You need never worry about that.

561
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:58,344
Since the day I entered
the Chantry as a girl,

562
00:42:58,344 --> 00:43:01,715
I have wished only to be
the Right Hand of the Divine.

563
00:43:03,884 --> 00:43:09,155
And that you are.
More than I could ever ask.

564
00:43:09,155 --> 00:43:11,758
[Grand Cleric] It will be a
great day for the Chantry,

565
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:13,627
the Maker willing.

566
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,299
[Divine] No matter
what happens,

567
00:43:19,299 --> 00:43:23,403
we must continue
with the ceremony.

568
00:43:23,403 --> 00:43:25,071
The Knight Commander
has assured me

569
00:43:25,071 --> 00:43:28,108
the Templars can
handle Chantry security.

570
00:43:31,344 --> 00:43:34,114
[Galyan]
Come on. Just a little farther.

571
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:36,216
We can rest here for a while.

572
00:43:39,052 --> 00:43:43,790
[Galyan]
Now then... Let there be light.

573
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:46,927
[crackling fire]

574
00:43:46,927 --> 00:43:54,100
[Cassandra breathes heavily]

575
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:56,703
[approaching steps]

576
00:43:56,703 --> 00:44:00,707
Cassandra, please...
let me treat your wound.

577
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,315
[Galyan]
Ah, that is a nasty scrape.

578
00:44:09,315 --> 00:44:10,951
Fortunately...

579
00:44:12,886 --> 00:44:15,221
I happen to have
just the thing for it.

580
00:44:16,189 --> 00:44:18,258
Now this will hurt a bit.

581
00:44:19,726 --> 00:44:21,427
[Galyan]
Sorry.

582
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:25,198
[Cassandra gasps in pain]

583
00:44:25,198 --> 00:44:27,100
My battle magic is mediocre,

584
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,903
but I am excellent
at healing spells.

585
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,115
[Galyan gasps]

586
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,290
[Galyan] You should be able to
move it normally in a day or so.

587
00:44:52,926 --> 00:44:56,162
[Cassandra] My elder brother
knew all about healing herbs.

588
00:44:56,162 --> 00:44:58,932
[Galyan]
Ah. Was he a Mage?

589
00:44:58,932 --> 00:45:01,001
[Cassandra snorts]

590
00:45:01,001 --> 00:45:03,804
It's merely a jest.

591
00:45:07,107 --> 00:45:09,442
He was murdered by Mages.

592
00:45:11,111 --> 00:45:16,416
Blood Mages...
When I was a child,

593
00:45:16,416 --> 00:45:19,886
my brother was cut down
right in front of me...

594
00:45:19,886 --> 00:45:24,257
They needed fresh dragon
blood for their rituals...

595
00:45:24,257 --> 00:45:25,959
So they came looking for

596
00:45:25,959 --> 00:45:29,362
the legendary dragon‐hunting
families of Nevarra,

597
00:45:29,362 --> 00:45:32,398
to capture a dragon for them.

598
00:45:36,302 --> 00:45:37,838
[people screaming]
[horses galloping]

599
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:40,473
[Cassandra] My brother
was the best in our family.

600
00:45:40,473 --> 00:45:43,443
His skills and honor
were unmatched.

601
00:45:43,443 --> 00:45:47,981
He wouldn't sacrifice a dragon
for their corrupted magic.

602
00:45:47,981 --> 00:45:52,052
The Blood Mages killed
all those who refused them.

603
00:45:52,052 --> 00:45:57,891
[metal clanging together]

604
00:45:57,891 --> 00:45:59,092
[grunt of pain]

605
00:45:59,092 --> 00:46:01,061
Uncle!!

606
00:46:02,563 --> 00:46:06,567
[Young Cassandra takes
short, gaspy breaths]

607
00:46:06,567 --> 00:46:08,034
[Cassandra's Brother
pants heavily]

608
00:46:08,034 --> 00:46:13,073
[horse's galloping hooves]

609
00:46:13,073 --> 00:46:15,308
Anthony...!

610
00:46:15,308 --> 00:46:22,115
[slow‐motion panting]

611
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:24,117
[sound of scythe
against the air]

612
00:46:26,953 --> 00:46:31,291
[crackling fire]

613
00:46:33,594 --> 00:46:39,833
My brother was strong... kind...
and I loved him dearly...

614
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:42,536
I've hated Mages ever since...

615
00:46:42,536 --> 00:46:46,540
Blood or Circle Mages...
They all seemed the same to me.

616
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:50,577
No different from the Mage
who murdered my brother...

617
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:56,282
I'm so sorry, Cassandra.

618
00:47:00,486 --> 00:47:05,626
It is true that both Circle
and Blood Mages are Mages...

619
00:47:05,626 --> 00:47:07,293
Our methods may differ,

620
00:47:07,293 --> 00:47:10,330
but there is no denying
we practice a common art...

621
00:47:12,032 --> 00:47:15,636
And as a Mage, I would
like to express my sorrow.

622
00:47:15,636 --> 00:47:20,006
What happened to your brother
was truly something horrendous.

623
00:47:43,496 --> 00:47:48,535
[crackling fire]

624
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:13,326

[quiet rustling of armor]

626
00:48:16,997 --> 00:48:18,431
[Templar A]
Move in.

627
00:48:28,542 --> 00:48:29,610
[Templar A]
They're gone!

628
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:32,145
[Knight Commander]
They couldn't have gotten far.

629
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,181
Find them!

630
00:48:35,181 --> 00:48:37,017
[All Templars] Sir!

631
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:48,529
[horse whickering]
[retreating hooves]

632
00:48:51,031 --> 00:48:53,433
Cassandra and the Mage
have disappeared, Frenic...

633
00:48:53,433 --> 00:48:57,337
They must be eliminated before
the Ten Year Gathering‐‐ Oh!

634
00:49:00,574 --> 00:49:03,043
You were saying, Commander?

635
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:14,020
[Galyan]
What have we here?

636
00:49:14,988 --> 00:49:18,592
This is an Elven Stone. He was
sending a message to someone.

637
00:49:19,726 --> 00:49:22,495
[Galyan]
"Understood, Knight Commander.
I will commence the search

638
00:49:22,495 --> 00:49:25,599
for Cassandra and Galyan's
whereabouts immediately.

639
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,267
Frenic."

640
00:49:31,738 --> 00:49:36,510
So, then... you are
in league with Frenic.

641
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:39,379
That's how you
found us so quickly!

642
00:49:39,379 --> 00:49:42,983
You'll pay for your
betrayal of the Chantry!

643
00:49:45,185 --> 00:49:47,688
[Knight Commander chuckles]

644
00:49:49,122 --> 00:49:50,591
[Cassandra gasps in pain]

645
00:49:53,059 --> 00:49:56,630
The wound still hurts,
doesn't it, Cassandra?

646
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,637
You both know too much...

647
00:50:03,637 --> 00:50:06,740
[metal clanging together]

648
00:50:08,341 --> 00:50:11,277
[Cassandra cries out in pain]

649
00:50:11,277 --> 00:50:12,779
[Cassandra pants]

650
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:18,552
[Galyan pants]

651
00:50:18,552 --> 00:50:21,354
[Cassandra]
Filthy traitor...

652
00:50:21,354 --> 00:50:25,091
Byron is dead because of you...

653
00:50:25,091 --> 00:50:27,493
[Cassandra grunts in anger]

654
00:50:27,493 --> 00:50:29,630
[Cassandra cries out in pain]

655
00:50:50,383 --> 00:50:52,352
[Cassandra]
No! This is not finished!

656
00:50:52,352 --> 00:50:54,555
[Galyan] Cassandra, protecting
the Circle and Chantry

657
00:50:54,555 --> 00:50:56,156
is more important than revenge.

658
00:50:56,156 --> 00:50:58,124
[Cassandra]
I owe it to Byron!

659
00:50:58,124 --> 00:51:01,161
[Galyan] We must show this
stone to the Chantry at once!

660
00:51:02,128 --> 00:51:04,164
Cassandra!

661
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:31,291
[chanting]

662
00:51:31,291 --> 00:51:33,860
[Frenic]
The conversion is complete...

663
00:51:37,764 --> 00:51:39,700
[Frenic] Behold!

664
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:44,270
The terror we shall soon
unleash upon the Chantry!

665
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:47,440
Now Avexis... Make them fly!

666
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:52,478
[deep growling sounds]

667
00:51:58,919 --> 00:52:01,755
[Frenic] Let our cries for
vengeance be carried forth

668
00:52:01,755 --> 00:52:04,324
on wings of fire...

669
00:52:04,324 --> 00:52:06,893
[satisfied sigh]

670
00:52:06,893 --> 00:52:08,729
Good...

671
00:52:08,729 --> 00:52:12,899
[loud roar]

672
00:52:12,899 --> 00:52:16,269
Good...

673
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:21,441
[Cassandra pants and grunts]

674
00:52:21,441 --> 00:52:29,449
[swishing, thwacking noises]

675
00:52:29,449 --> 00:52:32,853
[Galyan]
Go now. Safe journey, my friend.

676
00:52:32,853 --> 00:52:35,789
[wings flapping]

677
00:52:38,491 --> 00:52:40,193
[Cassandra]
This is it!

678
00:52:41,662 --> 00:52:45,832
[creaking, groaning noise]

679
00:52:45,832 --> 00:52:47,500
[Cassandra]
Give me a hand.

680
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,869
[creaking, groaning noise]

681
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:50,771
[metallic slamming sound]

682
00:52:52,238 --> 00:52:55,542
The High Seeker's Office
is through here.

683
00:53:02,282 --> 00:53:05,686
And you're sure that the front
door is out of the question?

684
00:53:05,686 --> 00:53:07,621
[Cassandra]
Just come on.

685
00:53:15,996 --> 00:53:18,431
[Galyan] Suddenly I get the
sense that sneaking in like this

686
00:53:18,431 --> 00:53:20,667
isn't going to help our case...

687
00:53:32,879 --> 00:53:35,916
[muffled coughing]

688
00:53:39,452 --> 00:53:42,322
[High Seeker]
I rather liked that cabinet.

689
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:46,259
[Cassandra]
High Seeker?

690
00:53:46,259 --> 00:53:49,429
I've been waiting for
your report, Cassandra...

691
00:53:49,429 --> 00:53:52,265
I feared you were captured.

692
00:53:52,265 --> 00:53:55,435
Feared? I thought
you were hunting me.

693
00:53:55,435 --> 00:53:57,470
I assumed you had your reasons

694
00:53:57,470 --> 00:54:00,306
and that you would
report in eventually.

695
00:54:00,306 --> 00:54:01,542
[High Seeker]
So...?

696
00:54:01,542 --> 00:54:03,476
Where do I start...?

697
00:54:11,351 --> 00:54:13,319
[High Seeker] Hm...

698
00:54:15,055 --> 00:54:18,625
While the Knight Commander
and I have had our differences,

699
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:20,694
I can't believe that
he would go so far

700
00:54:20,694 --> 00:54:22,729
as to subvert the Chantry.

701
00:54:22,729 --> 00:54:25,365
Then perhaps you
should look at this.

702
00:54:25,365 --> 00:54:27,701
[Galyan]
It's evidence of our claims.

703
00:54:30,771 --> 00:54:32,873
Interesting...

704
00:54:32,873 --> 00:54:35,509
I must show this to
the Divine at once.

705
00:54:35,509 --> 00:54:37,343
So you believe me?

706
00:54:37,343 --> 00:54:41,081
You've risked your life and
honor in pursuit of the truth.

707
00:54:41,081 --> 00:54:43,717
How could I doubt?

708
00:54:43,717 --> 00:54:46,987
You have the heart of a
true Seeker, Cassandra...

709
00:54:46,987 --> 00:54:48,822
As did Byron.

710
00:54:50,356 --> 00:54:51,925
[Cassandra]
Thank you, Sir...

711
00:54:53,493 --> 00:54:56,530
[High Seeker]
Wait here until my return.

712
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:59,365
[Cassandra] But there is
still so much to be done...

713
00:54:59,365 --> 00:55:03,469
Leave this to me...
and get some rest, Cassandra.

714
00:55:03,469 --> 00:55:05,572
Yes, High Seeker.

715
00:55:13,547 --> 00:55:15,015
[sound of impact]

716
00:55:15,015 --> 00:55:16,883
[footsteps]

717
00:55:16,883 --> 00:55:19,520
[pained grunts]

718
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,954
[Cassandra gasps]

719
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:32,733
[wrenching sound]

720
00:55:32,733 --> 00:55:34,500
[Cassandra]
High Seeker!

721
00:55:35,936 --> 00:55:37,403
You...!

722
00:55:37,403 --> 00:55:41,074
Isn't this yours?
You left it in the cave.

723
00:55:41,074 --> 00:55:43,510
Allow me to return it.

724
00:55:47,648 --> 00:55:49,382
Seekers!

725
00:55:49,382 --> 00:55:51,785
[armor clanking]
[running footsteps]

726
00:55:51,785 --> 00:55:52,786
[Seeker A]
High Seeker...!

727
00:55:52,786 --> 00:55:54,454
[Seeker B]
My liege!

728
00:55:55,956 --> 00:55:59,492
The fugitives murdered
the High Seeker. Arrest them!

729
00:55:59,492 --> 00:56:00,694
‐‐[Cassandra] No!
‐‐[Seeker A] Hold her!

730
00:56:00,694 --> 00:56:03,029
‐‐[Seeker B] Silence, traitor!
‐‐[Cassandra] He's lying!

731
00:56:04,097 --> 00:56:05,866
[Cassandra]
It was him!

732
00:56:05,866 --> 00:56:08,368
He's the murderer!

733
00:56:09,135 --> 00:56:11,905
He's the murderer!

734
00:56:13,774 --> 00:56:18,812
[organ music]

735
00:56:45,038 --> 00:56:49,943
Confess before the Maker
and be absolved of your sins.

736
00:56:49,943 --> 00:56:52,879
I just murdered the High Seeker

737
00:56:52,879 --> 00:56:56,550
and framed Cassandra
and the fugitive Mage.

738
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:59,052
They have been
branded as traitors.

739
00:56:59,052 --> 00:57:03,824
And soon, they will be
executed for their crimes.

740
00:57:08,562 --> 00:57:14,601
[Grand Cleric takes short,
trembling breaths]

741
00:57:26,246 --> 00:57:27,881
[Grand Cleric sighs quietly]

742
00:57:35,656 --> 00:57:38,725
Frenic and the girl are ready.

743
00:57:38,725 --> 00:57:41,194
A new era is upon us.

744
00:57:41,194 --> 00:57:45,699
The day where you may be
called "Divine" is imminent.

745
00:57:48,702 --> 00:57:49,570
[satisfied grunt]

746
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:51,705
And once the plan
comes to fruition,

747
00:57:51,705 --> 00:57:55,809
I will personally ensure
that Frenic's mouth is sealed.

748
00:57:55,809 --> 00:57:58,879
Pitiful Blood Mage...

749
00:57:58,879 --> 00:58:02,616
I am looking forward
to the Ten Year Gathering.

750
00:58:07,854 --> 00:58:11,925
[murmuring crowd]

751
00:58:14,227 --> 00:58:19,165
[Divine] I don't understand it.
He was such a great man.

752
00:58:19,165 --> 00:58:22,035
Why would Cassandra do this?

753
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:27,207
One can never fathom the
purpose of evil, Your Grace...

754
00:58:27,207 --> 00:58:31,077
But rest assured, they will
get their just reward.

755
00:58:35,816 --> 00:58:38,819
All of Orlais shares
your pain, Most Holy,

756
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:40,286
but in your own words,

757
00:58:40,286 --> 00:58:43,289
we must proceed with
the Ten Year Gathering.

758
00:58:44,157 --> 00:58:46,126
The Grand Clerics
have assembled,

759
00:58:46,126 --> 00:58:49,329
and the congregation has
gathered in the courtyard.

760
00:58:49,329 --> 00:58:51,998
They eagerly
await your blessing.

761
00:58:56,036 --> 00:58:57,871
I fear that great evil

762
00:58:57,871 --> 00:59:01,041
has gathered
amongst the good today...

763
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:04,277
Pray that the Maker
can bring us all together.

764
00:59:24,164 --> 00:59:27,333
Byron and the High Seeker
believed in me...

765
00:59:27,333 --> 00:59:30,003
and now they're dead.

766
00:59:30,003 --> 00:59:31,972
I should've let you finish
the Knight Commander

767
00:59:31,972 --> 00:59:34,007
when we had the chance.

768
00:59:35,642 --> 00:59:42,348
[approaching footsteps]

769
00:59:42,348 --> 00:59:44,885
Well, well, well...

770
00:59:44,885 --> 00:59:46,352
[Knight Commander chuckles]

771
00:59:51,224 --> 00:59:52,993
[Knight Commander] After
all your efforts,

772
00:59:52,993 --> 00:59:56,830
in the end, it came to this...

773
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,335
You've landed your heads
on the chopping block,

774
01:00:02,335 --> 01:00:04,838
and we still have Avexis.

775
01:00:04,838 --> 01:00:06,707
What are you doing with her?

776
01:00:06,707 --> 01:00:07,841
[Knight Commander laughs]

777
01:00:07,841 --> 01:00:09,876
You mean you don't know?

778
01:00:09,876 --> 01:00:12,679
The whole point of Frenic's
blood ritual was to give him

779
01:00:12,679 --> 01:00:15,916
complete control of
the girl and her abilities.

780
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:18,251
Control her for what purpose?

781
01:00:19,786 --> 01:00:23,724
Frenic will use her powers to
summon dragons to the Chantry...

782
01:00:23,724 --> 01:00:26,426
They should be
en route any moment.

783
01:00:26,426 --> 01:00:29,262
Is that even possible...?

784
01:00:29,262 --> 01:00:31,832
You're going after the Divine?!

785
01:00:31,832 --> 01:00:38,872
Yes, then a new era will unfold!
A new era where we rule...

786
01:00:38,872 --> 01:00:41,241
Even if you succeed in
murdering the Divine,

787
01:00:41,241 --> 01:00:44,044
the Seekers will never
let you seize power!

788
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:47,681
Oh, really?

789
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:52,753
You're right, they wouldn't...
Not him, at least.

790
01:00:53,754 --> 01:00:55,155
But a Cleric...?

791
01:00:55,155 --> 01:00:56,957
There's a reason
they've chosen dragons

792
01:00:56,957 --> 01:00:59,726
to carry out their
assassination plot.

793
01:01:02,128 --> 01:01:03,129
The Divine and

794
01:01:03,129 --> 01:01:04,865
all the candidates next
in line to succeed her

795
01:01:04,865 --> 01:01:06,833
are attending the
Ten Year Gathering,

796
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:09,703
and they will all be wiped out.

797
01:01:12,272 --> 01:01:15,976
This will be done publicly as
if it were a natural disaster,

798
01:01:15,976 --> 01:01:19,913
and whoever is left standing
will be the next Divine.

799
01:01:19,913 --> 01:01:24,017
But who is it? Who's the
traitor amongst the clerics?!

800
01:01:25,886 --> 01:01:29,055
I have no time to participate
in wild speculations

801
01:01:29,055 --> 01:01:30,256
with the likes of you.

802
01:01:30,256 --> 01:01:33,193
Who is the traitor...?! Who?!

803
01:01:33,894 --> 01:01:35,862
My orders are to execute you

804
01:01:35,862 --> 01:01:37,430
before the start
of the Gathering.

805
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:39,733
You'll have to continue
this conversation

806
01:01:39,733 --> 01:01:42,769
with Byron and the High Seeker.

807
01:01:44,404 --> 01:01:45,839
[Knight Commander sneers]

808
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:48,942
Who?! Who is the traitor?!

809
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:53,179
Templars!
Prepare for the execution!

810
01:01:53,179 --> 01:01:57,117
[Cassandra]
Tell me! Come back here!

811
01:01:57,117 --> 01:01:59,052
[Cassandra cries
out in frustration]

812
01:02:00,153 --> 01:02:05,191
[crowd murmuring]

813
01:02:12,132 --> 01:02:15,301
Yes, take it all in, Avexis...

814
01:02:15,301 --> 01:02:20,006
We are witness to the final
moments of a dying age...

815
01:02:20,006 --> 01:02:22,776
And you shall bring
about its demise.

816
01:02:22,776 --> 01:02:27,814
[crowd cheers and whistles]

817
01:02:42,929 --> 01:02:47,133
[distant cheering]

818
01:03:12,092 --> 01:03:13,393
Oh, Maker above!

819
01:03:13,393 --> 01:03:15,395
Shine down your
light and save me!

820
01:03:15,395 --> 01:03:17,063
[Templar A]
Silence, prisoner.

821
01:03:22,502 --> 01:03:24,137
[Knight Commander]
Wait!

822
01:03:31,111 --> 01:03:35,348
[Knight Commander] I'll dispatch
this fallen Seeker myself.

823
01:03:42,589 --> 01:03:46,059
Hmph. Your bravery
is commendable...

824
01:03:52,599 --> 01:03:54,267
Ahhhh!

825
01:03:58,138 --> 01:04:02,342
[various attack cries]

826
01:04:09,349 --> 01:04:10,951
[Cassandra]
Galyan!

827
01:04:10,951 --> 01:04:12,385
Are you all right?

828
01:04:13,587 --> 01:04:16,022
Galyan.. We got your message...

829
01:04:16,022 --> 01:04:18,058
Sorry we had
to cut things so close!

830
01:04:20,126 --> 01:04:22,529
I sent a message with a
bird to the Circle of Magi...

831
01:04:22,529 --> 01:04:24,631
Thank the Maker it arrived...

832
01:04:24,631 --> 01:04:26,867
[Templars growling angrily]

833
01:04:28,134 --> 01:04:29,870
[Cassandra shouts]

834
01:04:37,944 --> 01:04:39,513
[Alte] After you were
captured, we trailed

835
01:04:39,513 --> 01:04:40,581
the Knight Commander

836
01:04:40,581 --> 01:04:44,184
and learned some very
interesting information...

837
01:04:44,184 --> 01:04:48,188
He has been conspiring
with the Grand Cleric of Orlais.

838
01:04:48,188 --> 01:04:50,090
The Grand Cleric?!

839
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:54,260
Yes. They have been
meeting secretly for months.

840
01:05:21,054 --> 01:05:22,556
[Knight Commander]
Hyaargh!

841
01:05:25,992 --> 01:05:27,628
Cassandra!

842
01:05:30,496 --> 01:05:32,666
I know about the Grand Cleric.

843
01:05:32,666 --> 01:05:35,602
You have both turned
your backs on the Chantry!

844
01:05:35,602 --> 01:05:37,470
Ha! On the contrary,

845
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:40,473
we are ushering in a
new era for the Chantry...

846
01:05:40,473 --> 01:05:44,077
One where events like
Kirkwall will not be tolerated!

847
01:05:44,077 --> 01:05:47,280
[Cassandra] We won't
allow your plan to succeed!

848
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,383
[Cassandra and
Knight Commander struggle]

849
01:05:51,351 --> 01:05:56,389
[Cassandra and
Knight Commander grunt]

850
01:06:02,328 --> 01:06:07,433
[Knight Commander
grunts in pain]

851
01:06:23,383 --> 01:06:25,586
"Hate can only breed more hate."

852
01:06:25,586 --> 01:06:29,089
Those were Byron's
last words to me.

853
01:06:30,156 --> 01:06:33,026
Cassandra...

854
01:06:33,026 --> 01:06:36,496
[Cassandra] Tie him up.
He will answer for his crimes.

855
01:06:38,298 --> 01:06:40,166
[Circle Mage A]
You heard her. Up!

856
01:06:59,653 --> 01:07:03,423
In the end, it came to this...

857
01:07:03,423 --> 01:07:07,360
[bells tolling in the distance]

858
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,262
[Galyan]
It's the start of the Gathering.

859
01:07:17,403 --> 01:07:19,606
[Divine] Citizens of Orlais,

860
01:07:19,606 --> 01:07:22,709
honored faithful
from lands beyond,

861
01:07:22,709 --> 01:07:25,746
today we gather
to honor the Maker

862
01:07:25,746 --> 01:07:28,381
and his greatest gift to us...

863
01:07:28,381 --> 01:07:34,154
...his wife of the spirit,
Andraste, our beloved prophet

864
01:07:34,154 --> 01:07:38,158
who gave her life so that
the Chantry might live...

865
01:07:38,158 --> 01:07:44,531
This day, each decade, marks
the beginning of a new life.

866
01:07:44,531 --> 01:07:47,300
A day when the
Maker's benediction

867
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:47,868
brings great joy and...

868
01:07:47,868 --> 01:07:51,104
[rushing air]

869
01:07:53,273 --> 01:07:55,509

01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:18,799
[clerics give out
frightened cries]

873

[dragon roars]

874
01:08:21,868 --> 01:08:26,640
Go on! Good! Crush them all!

875
01:08:31,344 --> 01:08:33,547
[screams from clerics]

876
01:08:33,547 --> 01:08:35,682
[loud roar]

877
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:42,288
[screaming, frantic
cries of the clerics]

878
01:08:44,257 --> 01:08:48,695
Maker's wrath! He sends
dragons to punish our sins!

879
01:08:54,601 --> 01:09:01,174
[crowd cries in panic]

880
01:09:01,174 --> 01:09:02,909
[Templar A]
Protect the Divine!

881
01:09:02,909 --> 01:09:04,611
[Templar B]
Come on!

882
01:09:13,386 --> 01:09:14,387
[Templar H]
Most Holy...

883
01:09:14,387 --> 01:09:16,422
No... She's cut off...

884
01:09:28,401 --> 01:09:30,470
[Cassandra]
We're too late...

885
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:32,739
Frenic and Avexis
should be close by!

886
01:09:32,739 --> 01:09:35,475
[Galyan]
I'll find them!

887

[Frenic] Dragon Hunter...

895
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:18,779
Call the High Dragon!

896
01:11:29,723 --> 01:11:31,424

Finish her! Yes! Yes!! Hahahaha!

900
01:12:01,588 --> 01:12:04,591
[Galyan] She's done enough
of your bidding, Frenic.

901
01:12:05,592 --> 01:12:08,061
You'll never
harm this girl again!

902
01:12:10,631 --> 01:12:13,499
It's over. All of it.

[quiet growling]

912
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,942
[Cassandra] Are you
all right, your grace?

913
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:35,649
[Templar H]
Your Holiness!

[Templar H]
Most Holy!

916
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:39,953
[Cassandra]
Quickly. Help her down.

917
01:13:39,953 --> 01:13:42,556
‐‐[Templar I] Your Holiness!
‐‐[Te. H] Right, we've got her.

918
01:13:42,556 --> 01:13:45,458
Thank you, Cassandra...
Come, Your Holiness.

919
01:13:45,458 --> 01:13:47,160
[Templar I]
The Maker be with you!

920
01:13:48,829 --> 01:13:51,732
Heh, heh, heh...

921
01:13:51,732 --> 01:13:53,066
[Frenic] Fool...

922
01:13:53,066 --> 01:13:57,070
Do you really think I will
surrender so easily?

923
01:13:57,070 --> 01:14:02,976
[Frenic yells]

924
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:14,955
[Frenic]
Hyargh!

925
01:14:21,227 --> 01:14:22,896
[Alte]
Together, men!

926
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:31,805
[Grand Cleric]
Frenic...

927
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:38,979
[Cassandra] There is no
one coming to help you.

928
01:14:38,979 --> 01:14:41,147
The Knight Commander is dead.

929
01:14:48,855 --> 01:14:52,092
Do you hear?
Your plan failed, Mage.

You are no longer
of any use to me!

934
01:15:19,653 --> 01:15:21,287
[Frenic]
This was never about her.

935
01:15:21,287 --> 01:15:24,558
I merely exploited her ambition
as a means to free us

936
01:15:24,558 --> 01:15:27,160
from the oppressive
binds of the Chantry,

937
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:31,932
and create a new world
controlled by Mages!

938
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:38,338
[Frenic] As a fellow Mage,
you should understand.

939
01:15:38,338 --> 01:15:40,841
You and I are not the same.

940
01:15:41,808 --> 01:15:46,212
Then I will destroy you all,
along with the Chantry!

941
01:15:49,249 --> 01:15:51,017
[Frenic] Hwa!

942

We need you, Avexis! Wake up!
