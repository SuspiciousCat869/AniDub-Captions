00:02:28.542 --> 00:02:32.413 position:19% line:83% align:start
A stone statue?! So he
switched places?!

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.284 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:02:39.818 --> 00:02:41.654 position:16% line:89% align:start
How careless, Kinshiki.

00:02:45.824 --> 00:02:46.858 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh?

00:02:47.693 --> 00:02:48.859 position:30% line:89% align:start
The Rinnegan?

00:03:07.611 --> 00:03:10.480 position:10% line:89% align:start
Naruto Uzumaki. He's my dad.

00:03:11.448 --> 00:03:13.082 position:10% line:89% align:start
He's not like everyone else.

00:03:13.115 --> 00:03:15.684 position:27% line:83% align:start
He's the busiest
shinobi in the village.

00:03:15.718 --> 00:03:18.654 position:21% line:83% align:start
What I mean is: he's
the Seventh Hokage.

00:03:19.655 --> 00:03:25.026 position:13% line:83% align:start
But still, even if that's
true it's no excuse for him

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:26.793 position:21% line:89% align:start
to keep ignoring me!

00:03:41.907 --> 00:03:43.042 position:21% line:89% align:start
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:47.546 position:38% line:89% align:start
[growl]

00:03:50.382 --> 00:03:52.050 position:24% line:83% align:start
You really messed
this place up.

00:03:54.785 --> 00:03:57.921 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I'm your opponent
now! You damned panda!

00:03:57.955 --> 00:03:59.691 position:35% line:89% align:start
[growling]

00:04:01.726 --> 00:04:03.827 position:13% line:83% align:start
Huh? That thing's a bear!
It only looks like

00:04:03.861 --> 00:04:05.828 position:24% line:89% align:start
a vicious panda!

00:04:05.862 --> 00:04:07.997 position:13% line:89% align:start
Whatever. This'll be easy.

00:04:08.031 --> 00:04:10.066 position:16% line:83% align:start
This guy's just an ugly
panda, after all!

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.468 position:24% line:83% align:start
Boruto, you idiot!
It's a bear!

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:14.737 position:27% line:83% align:start
Does that really
matter right now?

00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:17.473 position:16% line:83% align:start
What matters is to lure
this bear-panda right to

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:18.907 position:24% line:89% align:start
Konohamaru Sensei.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.075 position:35% line:89% align:start
[growling]

00:04:20.542 --> 00:04:22.810 position:33% line:89% align:start
[angry roar]

00:04:32.787 --> 00:04:34.789 position:35% line:89% align:start
Cha- Huh?!

00:04:44.863 --> 00:04:47.399 position:21% line:83% align:start
See? That panda was
a piece of cake!

00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:51.503 position:10% line:83% align:start
Just leave it to the son of
the Seventh Hokage and

00:04:51.537 --> 00:04:53.138 position:16% line:89% align:start
grandson of the Fourth.

00:04:53.172 --> 00:04:56.608 position:19% line:83% align:start
He'll probably become
Hokage, too.

00:04:58.476 --> 00:05:00.111 position:16% line:89% align:start
No, I'm gonna be Hokage!

00:05:09.953 --> 00:05:11.621 position:16% line:89% align:start
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu!

00:05:14.591 --> 00:05:15.991 position:27% line:89% align:start
[angry growling]

00:05:23.766 --> 00:05:25.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
The recovery team
will be here soon.

00:05:25.735 --> 00:05:27.969 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's great news.
Thank you so much.

00:05:29.237 --> 00:05:31.673 position:21% line:83% align:start
But, um. Konohamaru
Sensei...

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:34.975 position:13% line:83% align:start
That jutsu before, wasn't
it actually a Secret

00:05:35.008 --> 00:05:37.111 position:16% line:89% align:start
Jutsu of the Nara Clan?

00:05:37.144 --> 00:05:38.679 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:05:43.082 --> 00:05:44.917 position:27% line:89% align:start
Whoa! How cool!

00:05:44.951 --> 00:05:47.821 position:16% line:83% align:start
Those rumors... Is that
the new Ninja Tool?

00:05:47.855 --> 00:05:49.822 position:10% line:89% align:start
You hear news fast, Mitsuki.

00:05:49.856 --> 00:05:52.458 position:21% line:83% align:start
The Scientific Ninja
Tool Team made it.

00:05:52.492 --> 00:05:54.993 position:21% line:83% align:start
Gathering data about
this prototype was also

00:05:55.026 --> 00:05:56.895 position:16% line:89% align:start
a part of this mission.

00:05:56.928 --> 00:05:59.798 position:21% line:83% align:start
This is an extremely
small scroll.

00:05:59.831 --> 00:06:02.501 position:24% line:83% align:start
And this contains
that jutsu?

00:06:02.534 --> 00:06:05.536 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yes, this thing
can seal ninjutsu.

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:08.873 position:13% line:83% align:start
Just like Mr. Shikamaru's
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu.

00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:13.577 position:24% line:83% align:start
For example, this
is my Rasengan.

00:06:22.217 --> 00:06:23.686 position:16% line:89% align:start
Then I can release it...

00:06:23.952 --> 00:06:25.721 position:30% line:89% align:start
...like this!

00:06:31.794 --> 00:06:33.161 position:35% line:89% align:start
Whoa! Wow!

00:06:33.194 --> 00:06:35.897 position:27% line:83% align:start
Awesome! So, can
anyone use it?

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:36.697 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:06:36.731 --> 00:06:38.800 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's separate from
your own chakra.

00:06:38.833 --> 00:06:40.967 position:19% line:83% align:start
You don't really even
need to be a ninja!

00:06:42.804 --> 00:06:44.638 position:21% line:89% align:start
Konohamaru Sensei...

00:06:44.906 --> 00:06:47.006 position:27% line:83% align:start
Since one's own
chakra isn't involved...

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:49.643 position:21% line:83% align:start
...the aim could be
off, which I guess

00:06:49.676 --> 00:06:51.544 position:19% line:89% align:start
could pose a problem.

00:06:58.884 --> 00:07:00.820 position:24% line:83% align:start
The most important
thing is to communicate

00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:02.654 position:21% line:89% align:start
properly, you know?

00:07:02.687 --> 00:07:04.189 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're right, of course.

00:07:04.222 --> 00:07:06.658 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you're just tuning in,
Seventh Hokage Naruto

00:07:06.691 --> 00:07:09.026 position:19% line:83% align:start
Uzumaki just said that
"communication" is

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:11.662 position:19% line:83% align:start
how our current peace
was reached after the

00:07:11.696 --> 00:07:13.297 position:19% line:89% align:start
many wars of the past.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.065 position:16% line:83% align:start
But we must never forget
that this peace was made

00:07:16.098 --> 00:07:20.236 position:13% line:83% align:start
possible by the sacrifice
of many, many shinobi.

00:07:20.269 --> 00:07:21.872 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's right, you know.

00:07:21.905 --> 00:07:24.874 position:16% line:83% align:start
So to ensure that these
fallen shinobi of past wars

00:07:24.907 --> 00:07:27.209 position:21% line:83% align:start
did not die in vain
and to preserve

00:07:27.242 --> 00:07:29.077 position:21% line:89% align:start
this hard-won peace.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.214 position:13% line:83% align:start
We must make sure to teach
this history to the youth,

00:07:32.247 --> 00:07:33.949 position:16% line:89% align:start
to the next generation.

00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:35.784 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's right, you know.

00:07:35.817 --> 00:07:39.053 position:10% line:83% align:start
We can't say that the scars
left by this great war, in

00:07:39.086 --> 00:07:41.555 position:21% line:83% align:start
which five villages
became embroiled,

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:43.090 position:16% line:89% align:start
have completely healed.

00:07:43.123 --> 00:07:45.826 position:13% line:83% align:start
But through the efforts of
the Seventh Hokage, the five

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.095 position:10% line:83% align:start
villages, which were once at
odds, have become one.

00:07:49.128 --> 00:07:51.598 position:24% line:83% align:start
And step by step,
they're making inroads

00:07:51.631 --> 00:07:52.998 position:27% line:89% align:start
toward progress.

00:07:53.031 --> 00:07:55.133 position:27% line:83% align:start
You've got that
right, you know.

00:07:55.167 --> 00:07:57.269 position:16% line:83% align:start
Our society's advancing
through information and

00:07:57.302 --> 00:07:59.638 position:24% line:83% align:start
communication, and
we must guard the

00:07:59.671 --> 00:08:01.773 position:21% line:83% align:start
peace and prosperity
that we've secured.

00:08:01.807 --> 00:08:04.643 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now, turning our attention
to the Chunin Exams, which

00:08:04.676 --> 00:08:06.645 position:24% line:83% align:start
the five villages
have agreed to

00:08:06.678 --> 00:08:09.113 position:21% line:83% align:start
sponsor jointly for
the first time.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.048 position:10% line:83% align:start
For all of the genin who are
going to be participating

00:08:12.083 --> 00:08:14.184 position:16% line:89% align:start
this year, any advice?

00:08:14.217 --> 00:08:18.154 position:10% line:83% align:start
Remember these three things!
Teamwork and perseverance...

00:08:20.156 --> 00:08:23.025 position:21% line:83% align:start
And that's it! Good
luck to you all!

00:08:23.727 --> 00:08:26.730 position:24% line:83% align:start
[chuckle] But that
was only two things.

00:08:26.763 --> 00:08:29.598 position:24% line:83% align:start
Anyway, thanks for
those inspiring words.

00:08:29.632 --> 00:08:32.701 position:13% line:83% align:start
And thanks to you all for
joining us live today!

00:08:35.704 --> 00:08:39.674 position:10% line:83% align:start
Hey, Dad, I'm not talking to
some Shadow Clone now, am I?

00:08:39.707 --> 00:08:42.810 position:16% line:83% align:start
No, of course not. It's
the Hokage's office.

00:08:42.844 --> 00:08:45.345 position:13% line:83% align:start
And by the way, don't call
me "Dad" in here. It's Lord

00:08:45.379 --> 00:08:48.048 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hokage or Lord Seventh.

00:08:48.081 --> 00:08:50.651 position:27% line:89% align:start
So? How'd it go?

00:08:50.684 --> 00:08:53.352 position:16% line:83% align:start
What do you think? That
mission was way easy!

00:08:53.386 --> 00:08:56.322 position:24% line:83% align:start
I mean, I could've
done it all by myself!

00:08:56.355 --> 00:08:59.358 position:19% line:83% align:start
What's important for a
shinobi is teamwork

00:08:59.392 --> 00:09:01.226 position:24% line:89% align:start
and perseverance.

00:09:01.259 --> 00:09:03.361 position:24% line:83% align:start
You have to train
as a trio and-

00:09:03.395 --> 00:09:06.331 position:10% line:83% align:start
I didn't have to train to be
able to make three Shadow

00:09:06.364 --> 00:09:08.800 position:10% line:89% align:start
Clones of myself! [chuckle]

00:09:08.833 --> 00:09:11.970 position:10% line:83% align:start
I know Wind Style, Lightning
Style and now Water Style!

00:09:12.003 --> 00:09:13.203 position:33% line:89% align:start
Konohamaru!

00:09:13.237 --> 00:09:14.806 position:30% line:83% align:start
What have you
been teaching him?!

00:09:17.708 --> 00:09:19.810 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't blame my sensei
just 'cause you don't

00:09:19.843 --> 00:09:21.812 position:21% line:83% align:start
know anything about
me, all right?

00:09:21.845 --> 00:09:24.247 position:19% line:83% align:start
You've never bothered
to even watch me!

00:09:29.117 --> 00:09:31.688 position:21% line:89% align:start
[sigh] Never mind...

00:09:31.721 --> 00:09:32.855 position:13% line:89% align:start
Look, what's important is-

00:09:32.889 --> 00:09:36.358 position:13% line:83% align:start
Forget that! What's really
important now is what day it

00:09:36.391 --> 00:09:39.361 position:13% line:89% align:start
is! Do you even know why?

00:09:39.394 --> 00:09:42.129 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you forgot my kid
sister's birthday, I'll

00:09:42.163 --> 00:09:44.933 position:24% line:89% align:start
never forgive you.

00:09:54.041 --> 00:09:55.742 position:27% line:89% align:start
Excuse me, sir?

00:09:55.775 --> 00:09:58.445 position:33% line:89% align:start
Katasuke...

00:09:58.478 --> 00:10:01.047 position:24% line:83% align:start
As the head of the
Scientific Ninja Tool Team,

00:10:01.081 --> 00:10:03.782 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have a request to
make, Lord Seventh.

00:10:03.816 --> 00:10:05.051 position:33% line:89% align:start
What is it?

00:10:05.085 --> 00:10:07.353 position:16% line:83% align:start
For the upcoming Chunin
Exams, we'd like your

00:10:07.386 --> 00:10:09.989 position:21% line:83% align:start
authorization to the
use the ninja tool

00:10:10.022 --> 00:10:11.857 position:30% line:89% align:start
our team made!

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.392 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then the genin won't have
to go through such harsh

00:10:14.425 --> 00:10:17.428 position:16% line:83% align:start
training and they'd have
more ninjutsu to use!

00:10:17.462 --> 00:10:21.032 position:10% line:83% align:start
Their performances would be
more elaborate as well!

00:10:21.065 --> 00:10:23.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
And if we market these ninja
tools to other villages, the

00:10:23.867 --> 00:10:26.403 position:21% line:83% align:start
income will benefit
Hidden Leaf Village.

00:10:26.436 --> 00:10:28.137 position:38% line:89% align:start
No way.

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:31.173 position:13% line:83% align:start
The Chunin Exams are not a
"performance." Their purpose

00:10:31.207 --> 00:10:33.110 position:19% line:89% align:start
is to nurture shinobi.

00:10:35.244 --> 00:10:36.846 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, I see.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.115 position:33% line:89% align:start
Excuse me...

00:10:53.128 --> 00:10:56.130 position:16% line:83% align:start
This isn't the lame era
you grew up in, Dad.

00:10:56.864 --> 00:10:58.999 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, Boruto! Wait!

00:11:00.299 --> 00:11:03.002 position:21% line:83% align:start
I was just about to
give him the Chunin

00:11:03.036 --> 00:11:04.404 position:24% line:89% align:start
Exams application!

00:11:04.437 --> 00:11:05.404 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:11:06.139 --> 00:11:07.406 position:33% line:89% align:start
Here you go.

00:11:07.439 --> 00:11:09.241 position:21% line:89% align:start
Great, thanks again!

00:11:09.274 --> 00:11:12.244 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now, you didn't forget the
new software, did you?

00:11:12.277 --> 00:11:13.879 position:13% line:89% align:start
You know that I wouldn't.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.015 position:10% line:83% align:start
Are you entering the Chunin
Exams, young lord?

00:11:17.049 --> 00:11:18.083 position:33% line:89% align:start
Nah, no way.

00:11:18.116 --> 00:11:21.385 position:13% line:83% align:start
Sorry to hear that. What a
shame, I'm sure everyone

00:11:21.419 --> 00:11:24.155 position:19% line:83% align:start
would want to see your
skills in action.

00:11:24.187 --> 00:11:27.024 position:27% line:83% align:start
Especially your
father, right?

00:11:27.058 --> 00:11:31.294 position:13% line:83% align:start
Wait, the Hokage is there
watching the Chunin Exams?

00:11:31.327 --> 00:11:33.096 position:35% line:89% align:start
Of course!

00:11:40.436 --> 00:11:43.172 position:19% line:83% align:start
So you're an expert at
video games, too, huh?

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.209 position:30% line:83% align:start
Look, what do
you want, Mitsuki?

00:11:48.242 --> 00:11:50.044 position:30% line:83% align:start
I already said
I'm not interested.

00:11:50.078 --> 00:11:52.312 position:24% line:83% align:start
Konohamaru Sensei
asked us to come here.

00:11:52.345 --> 00:11:54.448 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yeah. We need a
three-man team to enter

00:11:54.481 --> 00:11:56.050 position:24% line:89% align:start
the Chunin Exams.

00:11:56.084 --> 00:11:58.119 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you don't apply,
then we can't.

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:00.687 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, so what?

00:12:00.721 --> 00:12:03.857 position:10% line:83% align:start
Look, my dream is to become
the Hokage. Are you going to

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.391 position:24% line:89% align:start
destroy my dream?!

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:08.061 position:24% line:89% align:start
Becoming Hokage...

00:12:08.095 --> 00:12:09.795 position:21% line:83% align:start
...doesn't interest
me at all!

00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:15.034 position:24% line:83% align:start
Being Hokage isn't
hereditary!

00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:17.836 position:13% line:83% align:start
Fine, then you can be the
Hokage for all I care.

00:12:17.869 --> 00:12:20.105 position:19% line:89% align:start
Ruin your family, too.

00:12:20.138 --> 00:12:23.908 position:21% line:83% align:start
The Hokage is just a
nuisance to everyone.

00:12:24.175 --> 00:12:25.442 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:12:27.611 --> 00:12:30.313 position:24% line:83% align:start
Boruto, we need a
third man too, or we

00:12:30.346 --> 00:12:32.348 position:13% line:89% align:start
won't get past this level.

00:12:32.381 --> 00:12:34.517 position:19% line:83% align:start
We just don't have any
chance of beating the next

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.319 position:10% line:89% align:start
boss if you don't help out.

00:12:37.221 --> 00:12:39.055 position:27% line:83% align:start
Then here, I'll
give you my data.

00:12:39.321 --> 00:12:41.824 position:16% line:83% align:start
This one has shortcuts.
It's really easy.

00:12:43.325 --> 00:12:46.461 position:19% line:83% align:start
Uh maybe, but I don't
really want that.

00:12:46.495 --> 00:12:48.530 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's okay; someone
gave them to me, too.

00:12:54.602 --> 00:12:56.837 position:27% line:89% align:start
This is a cheat.

00:12:58.472 --> 00:13:00.273 position:21% line:89% align:start
Huh? You're leaving?

00:13:00.306 --> 00:13:03.077 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah, this is only fun
because I have to sneak

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:05.311 position:13% line:89% align:start
away from Mom to play it.

00:13:07.413 --> 00:13:10.016 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, guess I'd
better go, too.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:20.525 position:13% line:83% align:start
We should at least get our
applications together.

00:13:20.558 --> 00:13:24.163 position:19% line:83% align:start
Listen, we're a team,
isn't that right?

00:13:24.196 --> 00:13:26.164 position:21% line:89% align:start
Can't you cooperate?

00:13:26.197 --> 00:13:28.298 position:27% line:89% align:start
Please, Boruto.

00:13:28.331 --> 00:13:32.136 position:10% line:83% align:start
In the Chunin Exams, we can
show Lord Seventh what we've

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.937 position:13% line:89% align:start
got! So what do you say?

00:13:36.072 --> 00:13:37.607 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm sure everyone
would want to see

00:13:37.641 --> 00:13:39.608 position:16% line:89% align:start
your skills in action.

00:13:39.642 --> 00:13:41.977 position:27% line:83% align:start
Especially your
father, right?

00:13:45.481 --> 00:13:47.082 position:30% line:89% align:start
Okay, already.

00:13:47.315 --> 00:13:49.919 position:21% line:83% align:start
You want me to join
you, I'll join you.

00:13:50.186 --> 00:13:51.419 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:13:51.452 --> 00:13:52.887 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggle]

00:13:52.921 --> 00:13:54.489 position:30% line:89% align:start
He's so easy!

00:13:54.923 --> 00:13:57.424 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey, Sarada! Is your
dad gonna come watch?

00:13:57.457 --> 00:13:59.961 position:19% line:83% align:start
[chuckle] Who cares?!
He couldn't even

00:13:59.994 --> 00:14:01.495 position:30% line:89% align:start
become Hokage.

00:14:01.528 --> 00:14:03.664 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're wrong about him.
My dad used to say that

00:14:03.697 --> 00:14:07.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
Uncle Sasuke is
"the other Hokage."

00:14:07.267 --> 00:14:09.236 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, please! He's
just being nice!

00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:11.537 position:13% line:83% align:start
Sasuke is the only shinobi
who could rival the Seventh

00:14:11.571 --> 00:14:15.373 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hokage. That's what
my parent said.

00:14:15.641 --> 00:14:17.576 position:21% line:83% align:start
And my parent's even
more awesome than

00:14:17.609 --> 00:14:19.212 position:24% line:89% align:start
both of your dads.

00:14:20.378 --> 00:14:21.613 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groan]

00:14:21.646 --> 00:14:23.081 position:30% line:89% align:start
What's wrong?

00:14:23.114 --> 00:14:25.150 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey, who are your
parents, anyway?

00:14:25.183 --> 00:14:28.053 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah, you never told
me that, either.

00:14:28.086 --> 00:14:29.321 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, well, it's-

00:14:29.353 --> 00:14:31.323 position:33% line:89% align:start
Big Brother!

00:14:32.723 --> 00:14:36.260 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's my birthday today! So
hurry up! Let's go home!

00:14:37.161 --> 00:14:39.996 position:19% line:83% align:start
Sure! [chuckle] Sorry,
but I gotta go!

00:14:44.433 --> 00:14:45.534 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hurry, Brother!

00:14:48.204 --> 00:14:50.240 position:10% line:83% align:start
Himawari, we're gonna feast
tonight. [chuckling]

00:14:50.273 --> 00:14:52.241 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yay! [giggling]

00:14:53.008 --> 00:14:56.178 position:21% line:83% align:start
So Boruto knows how
to smile after all.

00:14:56.211 --> 00:14:57.612 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:15:05.253 --> 00:15:06.354 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:15:08.388 --> 00:15:10.090 position:16% line:89% align:start
So you actually made it.

00:15:13.126 --> 00:15:18.397 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, happy birthday
on your special day.

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:24.303 position:10% line:83% align:start
That you are very precious,
is what we want to say!

00:15:24.336 --> 00:15:28.406 position:21% line:83% align:start
And congratulations
sent your way!

00:15:29.674 --> 00:15:34.379 position:24% line:89% align:start
So happy birthday!

00:15:42.386 --> 00:15:44.154 position:24% line:89% align:start
A Shadow Clone...

00:15:47.391 --> 00:15:48.991 position:27% line:89% align:start
Boruto! Boruto!

00:15:49.292 --> 00:15:50.660 position:21% line:89% align:start
Just let me go, Mom!

00:15:50.693 --> 00:15:52.527 position:24% line:83% align:start
Your father has to
work very hard for the

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.996 position:19% line:89% align:start
people of the village.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:55.764 position:21% line:83% align:start
But it doesn't mean
that he's forgotten

00:15:55.797 --> 00:15:56.831 position:30% line:89% align:start
about you two!

00:15:56.865 --> 00:16:00.235 position:13% line:83% align:start
But why?! Why does my dad
have to be the Hokage?!

00:16:00.268 --> 00:16:03.071 position:16% line:83% align:start
He just sits at his desk
all day, acting bossy!

00:16:03.104 --> 00:16:05.072 position:21% line:89% align:start
Anyone can do that!

00:16:05.105 --> 00:16:07.441 position:27% line:83% align:start
Being Hokage is
a difficult job.

00:16:07.474 --> 00:16:10.210 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's a duty crucial to the
village's survival, passed

00:16:10.244 --> 00:16:11.778 position:13% line:89% align:start
down through generations!

00:16:11.811 --> 00:16:13.746 position:13% line:83% align:start
And the Hokage's kids are
supposed to be grateful for

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.216 position:10% line:83% align:start
being born into this stupid
situation, is that it?

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:21.120 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh yeah, I know our
grandpa was also Hokage.

00:16:21.154 --> 00:16:23.289 position:27% line:83% align:start
And when Dad was
a kid, Grandpa

00:16:23.323 --> 00:16:25.691 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hokage wasn't even alive!

00:16:25.724 --> 00:16:28.393 position:19% line:83% align:start
So I guess Dad's just
lucky that he never had to

00:16:28.427 --> 00:16:31.163 position:21% line:83% align:start
experience the "joy"
of having a parent around!

00:16:34.131 --> 00:16:35.533 position:27% line:89% align:start
I understand...

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.635 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's hard not having
your father around

00:16:37.668 --> 00:16:39.502 position:21% line:89% align:start
on important days.

00:16:39.536 --> 00:16:42.440 position:19% line:83% align:start
But nonetheless, it's
different with you.

00:16:44.308 --> 00:16:47.711 position:16% line:83% align:start
You still have a father
who's actually here.

00:16:47.744 --> 00:16:49.812 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's not about me.

00:16:49.845 --> 00:16:51.580 position:27% line:89% align:start
But Himawari...

00:16:54.316 --> 00:16:55.317 position:35% line:89% align:start
Forget it.

00:16:59.787 --> 00:17:01.256 position:35% line:89% align:start
Boruto...

00:17:32.451 --> 00:17:33.585 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:17:34.419 --> 00:17:36.154 position:21% line:89% align:start
I messed up again...

00:17:38.289 --> 00:17:41.326 position:30% line:83% align:start
Dad, what am I
supposed to do?

00:17:44.161 --> 00:17:45.429 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey, what happened?!

00:17:45.762 --> 00:17:47.364 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laugh]

00:17:47.398 --> 00:17:50.099 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'll finish up here. You go
home and get some rest.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.766 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's so dirty and
it's torn to shreds.

00:18:29.635 --> 00:18:32.538 position:19% line:83% align:start
But nonetheless, it's
different with you.

00:18:33.238 --> 00:18:36.141 position:16% line:83% align:start
You still have a father
who's actually here.

00:18:38.444 --> 00:18:40.311 position:24% line:89% align:start
This is so uncool.

00:18:47.351 --> 00:18:48.453 position:38% line:89% align:start
Is that?

00:18:50.586 --> 00:18:51.587 position:27% line:89% align:start
Now he shows up?

00:19:01.729 --> 00:19:04.166 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh! I'm sorry, I,
uh, thought that

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.468 position:27% line:89% align:start
you were my dad.

00:19:06.569 --> 00:19:08.303 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're Naruto's son?

00:19:08.571 --> 00:19:10.438 position:30% line:89% align:start
And your name?

00:19:10.472 --> 00:19:12.773 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's Boruto Uzumaki.

00:19:14.209 --> 00:19:16.478 position:16% line:89% align:start
Is that really-? Sasuke!

00:19:18.345 --> 00:19:19.880 position:27% line:89% align:start
Is Naruto here?

00:19:20.347 --> 00:19:23.350 position:19% line:83% align:start
I think he's still at
the Hokage's office.

00:19:24.485 --> 00:19:26.619 position:10% line:89% align:start
I see. Sorry to bother you.

00:19:27.487 --> 00:19:29.922 position:27% line:83% align:start
He's the one who
was Dad's rival...

00:19:30.356 --> 00:19:32.225 position:30% line:89% align:start
He's so cool!

00:19:48.806 --> 00:19:49.906 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's this?

00:19:51.375 --> 00:19:53.544 position:10% line:89% align:start
A gift from Kaguya's Palace.

00:19:54.545 --> 00:19:55.812 position:38% line:89% align:start
Sasuke!

00:19:58.615 --> 00:20:01.351 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm getting a bad
feeling about this.

00:20:01.384 --> 00:20:03.520 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't even read it
with my Rinnegan.

00:20:03.553 --> 00:20:06.255 position:27% line:83% align:start
There was also a
guy that worries me.

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:08.423 position:30% line:83% align:start
But he didn't
follow me back.

00:20:08.457 --> 00:20:10.425 position:13% line:89% align:start
Guess I'm not going home.

00:20:11.293 --> 00:20:13.794 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now let's figure out
what this scroll says.

00:20:13.828 --> 00:20:15.730 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, also...

00:20:17.999 --> 00:20:19.699 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why do you have that?!

00:20:19.733 --> 00:20:21.935 position:30% line:83% align:start
I found it on
the way here.

00:20:21.968 --> 00:20:23.436 position:38% line:89% align:start
I see...

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:26.840 position:21% line:83% align:start
I also met your kid.
Seems just like you

00:20:26.873 --> 00:20:28.908 position:21% line:89% align:start
when you were young.

00:20:28.941 --> 00:20:33.946 position:19% line:83% align:start
No, you're wrong. He's
nothing like I was.

00:20:34.713 --> 00:20:37.916 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's a lot more like you
when you were young.

00:20:37.949 --> 00:20:39.851 position:41% line:89% align:start
No...

00:20:39.884 --> 00:20:43.755 position:19% line:83% align:start
I take that back. He's
different from you, too.

00:20:44.589 --> 00:20:47.292 position:21% line:83% align:start
His clothing always
looks brand new.

00:20:47.325 --> 00:20:52.763 position:13% line:83% align:start
I guess you and I are just
behind the times, huh?

00:20:53.764 --> 00:20:55.299 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're wrong, you know.

00:20:55.332 --> 00:20:57.833 position:19% line:83% align:start
The soul of a shinobi
never changes.

00:20:57.867 --> 00:20:59.969 position:30% line:83% align:start
That goes for
your kid, too.

00:21:00.002 --> 00:21:02.606 position:16% line:89% align:start
[chuckle] I doubt that.

00:21:02.639 --> 00:21:06.275 position:10% line:83% align:start
Trust me, I think the winner
of this contest is me.

00:21:06.808 --> 00:21:08.043 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:21:08.076 --> 00:21:09.978 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're one to talk, loser.

00:21:25.092 --> 00:21:26.560 position:33% line:89% align:start
He vanished!

00:21:31.998 --> 00:21:35.535 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're amazing! You used to
be Dad's rival, didn't you?

00:21:38.671 --> 00:21:41.373 position:24% line:83% align:start
I get it now looks
brand-new.

00:21:42.507 --> 00:21:44.643 position:33% line:83% align:start
Please make
me your student!

00:21:44.676 --> 00:21:46.678 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's someone I
have to bring down!

00:21:50.047 --> 00:21:52.550 position:27% line:83% align:start
Can you perform
the Rasengan?

00:21:54.719 --> 00:21:57.387 position:16% line:83% align:start
Without that, you can't
be a student of mine.

00:21:59.389 --> 00:22:00.657 position:10% line:89% align:start
That'll be a piece of cake!

00:22:03.826 --> 00:22:07.464 position:21% line:83% align:start
Naruto, that earlier
contest isn't decided yet.

00:22:09.465 --> 00:22:10.966 position:24% line:89% align:start
Konohamaru Sensei!

00:22:11.866 --> 00:22:13.736 position:24% line:89% align:start
Konohamaru Sensei!

00:22:15.471 --> 00:22:17.573 position:10% line:89% align:start
Huh? What's all this about?

00:22:17.606 --> 00:22:20.575 position:10% line:83% align:start
Please, you just gotta teach
me how to do the Rasengan!

00:22:20.608 --> 00:22:22.543 position:24% line:83% align:start
Right now! I have
to master it!

00:22:22.577 --> 00:22:24.077 position:13% line:89% align:start
There's no time to waste!

00:22:25.846 --> 00:22:27.414 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, I see!

00:22:27.447 --> 00:22:29.782 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's for the Chunin Exams,
huh? To shock the Seventh

00:22:29.815 --> 00:22:32.085 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hokage! Is that correct?

00:22:32.552 --> 00:22:35.921 position:13% line:83% align:start
All right! At last you're
talking like a real shinobi!

00:22:35.955 --> 00:22:37.724 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh yeah, sure.

00:22:39.091 --> 00:22:41.427 position:21% line:83% align:start
Imagine me being the
instructor who gets to pass

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.362 position:21% line:83% align:start
on this jutsu to the
Hokage's son!

00:22:44.397 --> 00:22:47.032 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, Lord Fourth, Lord
Seventh! I will not fail to

00:22:47.065 --> 00:22:50.435 position:24% line:83% align:start
fulfill this very
important duty!

00:22:55.406 --> 00:22:57.107 position:30% line:83% align:start
Where did your
enthusiasm go?!

00:22:57.141 --> 00:22:58.875 position:16% line:89% align:start
Come on, just try again.

00:22:58.909 --> 00:23:00.910 position:30% line:83% align:start
Watch me, then
do it, like this!

00:23:00.943 --> 00:23:03.046 position:21% line:83% align:start
I know, I know! But
"like this" isn't

00:23:03.079 --> 00:23:04.914 position:10% line:89% align:start
working "like that" at all!

00:23:04.947 --> 00:23:07.383 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey, don't mock me by
repeating my words!

00:23:07.417 --> 00:23:09.851 position:19% line:83% align:start
No, I'm not! It's just
"this" isn't acting "like

00:23:09.885 --> 00:23:13.055 position:16% line:83% align:start
this!" "This" means this
thing in this hand here.

00:23:13.088 --> 00:23:14.956 position:24% line:83% align:start
Quit saying "this,
this, this!"

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:16.425 position:21% line:89% align:start
Look who's talking!

00:23:16.458 --> 00:23:17.858 position:35% line:89% align:start
[growling]

00:23:18.727 --> 00:23:21.028 position:10% line:83% align:start
And why does it have to be a
water balloon?! Isn't there

00:23:21.062 --> 00:23:22.798 position:13% line:89% align:start
a better way to do this?!

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.435 position:21% line:83% align:start
Listen, it took Lord
Fourth three entire years

00:23:27.468 --> 00:23:30.438 position:16% line:83% align:start
to invent this jutsu and
another six months to

00:23:30.471 --> 00:23:31.938 position:33% line:89% align:start
perfect it.

00:23:31.971 --> 00:23:35.075 position:10% line:83% align:start
Of course it's difficult to
master! I mean, it's A-rank!

00:23:44.784 --> 00:23:45.818 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.121 position:13% line:89% align:start
Damn! It's still no good!

00:24:03.768 --> 00:24:04.801 position:35% line:89% align:start
I did it!

00:24:05.935 --> 00:24:08.037 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yes, well done! Okay, now
it's on to the next step!

00:24:09.506 --> 00:24:11.675 position:27% line:83% align:start
What?! A rubber
ball this time?!

00:24:34.695 --> 00:24:35.696 position:44% line:89% align:start
No-

00:24:35.729 --> 00:24:36.996 position:38% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:24:37.964 --> 00:24:39.566 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:24:39.833 --> 00:24:41.100 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right!

00:24:56.947 --> 00:24:59.550 position:30% line:83% align:start
That thing is
awfully small...

00:24:59.583 --> 00:25:02.186 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'd be hard-pressed to
even call it a Rasengan.

00:25:04.053 --> 00:25:05.523 position:21% line:89% align:start
But the basics are-

00:25:05.556 --> 00:25:06.923 position:38% line:89% align:start
Damn it!

00:25:15.598 --> 00:25:18.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
Do you always have
to be so strict, Dad?

00:25:18.066 --> 00:25:19.903 position:30% line:83% align:start
You don't know
Boruto that well, so

00:25:19.935 --> 00:25:21.670 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'll just tell you...

00:25:21.703 --> 00:25:23.839 position:27% line:83% align:start
He isn't usually
like this at all.

00:25:23.872 --> 00:25:28.643 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's a miracle he even got
this far. Get it? Huh?

00:25:29.677 --> 00:25:32.613 position:19% line:83% align:start
He's too hasty. And he
assumed wrong.

00:25:32.647 --> 00:25:35.550 position:19% line:83% align:start
I was going to accept
him as my student.

00:25:35.583 --> 00:25:36.884 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggle]

00:25:41.721 --> 00:25:44.524 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's our biggest sale, all
items thirty to forty

00:25:44.558 --> 00:25:47.026 position:27% line:83% align:start
percent off and
double the points!

00:25:47.794 --> 00:25:49.028 position:35% line:89% align:start
Damn it...

00:25:54.733 --> 00:25:56.501 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's the matter?

00:25:57.602 --> 00:26:00.572 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ah, I see! That is a
difficult situation.

00:26:00.605 --> 00:26:02.306 position:21% line:83% align:start
But you're lucky you
ran into me, 'cause I

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:04.107 position:21% line:89% align:start
have just the thing.

00:26:04.809 --> 00:26:06.009 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's cool...

00:26:06.043 --> 00:26:07.077 position:33% line:89% align:start
...smart...

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:10.112 position:13% line:83% align:start
...and easy to use. You'll
get exceptionally good

00:26:10.147 --> 00:26:12.181 position:24% line:89% align:start
results, trust me.

00:26:16.085 --> 00:26:18.621 position:10% line:83% align:start
With this ninja tool, you'll
be what every shinobi of

00:26:18.654 --> 00:26:20.723 position:10% line:89% align:start
your generation wants to be!

00:26:20.756 --> 00:26:23.091 position:10% line:89% align:start
They'll all look up to you!

00:26:24.927 --> 00:26:26.595 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't you agree?

00:26:31.198 --> 00:26:34.068 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now, let's choose the
ultimate technique that's

00:26:34.101 --> 00:26:35.971 position:10% line:89% align:start
perfect for you, young lord!

00:26:43.643 --> 00:26:45.645 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hey, wait, when
did I get so dirty?

00:26:50.315 --> 00:26:51.551 position:41% line:89% align:start
Nice!

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.262 position:35% line:89% align:start
Rasengan!

00:27:23.947 --> 00:27:25.614 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, hey!

00:27:25.648 --> 00:27:28.017 position:35% line:89% align:start
Well? So?

00:27:28.049 --> 00:27:30.285 position:24% line:83% align:start
All that from just
one day of training?

00:27:30.318 --> 00:27:32.153 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm not like my dad!

00:27:32.186 --> 00:27:34.222 position:27% line:89% align:start
I've got skills!

00:27:35.323 --> 00:27:38.693 position:19% line:83% align:start
It seems you are quite
different from Naruto.

00:27:38.726 --> 00:27:40.895 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'd hoped that
wasn't the case.

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:45.265 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey! So what do you say?

00:27:45.732 --> 00:27:47.133 position:27% line:83% align:start
About making me
your student?!

00:27:49.268 --> 00:27:51.337 position:10% line:89% align:start
Fine. You can be my student.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:01.112 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sensei, tell me
about my dad.

00:28:05.417 --> 00:28:07.318 position:13% line:83% align:start
When he was a kid, he just
went around saying he'd be

00:28:07.351 --> 00:28:10.956 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hokage one day. He
was quite a loser.

00:28:10.989 --> 00:28:12.189 position:35% line:89% align:start
A loser?!

00:28:12.222 --> 00:28:14.223 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah, and stubborn
as hell, too.

00:28:14.257 --> 00:28:15.426 position:30% line:89% align:start
No, not that!

00:28:15.459 --> 00:28:18.661 position:10% line:83% align:start
I want to know all about my
dad's weaknesses, you know!

00:28:18.695 --> 00:28:19.897 position:33% line:89% align:start
Weaknesses?

00:28:28.236 --> 00:28:30.973 position:19% line:83% align:start
Listen, he was full of
weaknesses. He was a

00:28:31.006 --> 00:28:32.674 position:24% line:89% align:start
good-for-nothing.

00:28:32.941 --> 00:28:33.976 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:28:34.009 --> 00:28:36.177 position:16% line:83% align:start
But he pulled himself up
with his own strength and

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:38.080 position:24% line:89% align:start
became the Hokage.

00:28:38.346 --> 00:28:41.816 position:13% line:83% align:start
What you need to know now
isn't the current Naruto,

00:28:41.849 --> 00:28:44.752 position:24% line:83% align:start
but the Naruto who
made it this far.

00:28:44.785 --> 00:28:46.787 position:19% line:89% align:start
What does that mean?!

00:28:52.092 --> 00:28:53.292 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's finally time!

00:28:54.761 --> 00:28:56.395 position:16% line:89% align:start
Good luck! Do your best!

00:28:56.428 --> 00:28:58.897 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're energetic this
morning, Mom. Is it Dad

00:28:58.931 --> 00:29:01.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
coming home after
such a long time that's

00:29:01.132 --> 00:29:02.735 position:21% line:89% align:start
making you so happy?

00:29:02.768 --> 00:29:04.402 position:13% line:89% align:start
What?! No! Don't be silly!

00:29:04.435 --> 00:29:06.437 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's silly how
silly you're being!

00:29:06.471 --> 00:29:09.307 position:16% line:83% align:start
Just give it up, mom. I
can tell these things.

00:29:10.475 --> 00:29:12.443 position:16% line:89% align:start
Anyway, I'm outta here!

00:29:13.477 --> 00:29:15.046 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:29:15.079 --> 00:29:17.247 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're just as happy
he's back, Sarada.

00:29:25.055 --> 00:29:27.289 position:24% line:83% align:start
So, you convinced
my Dad, huh, Boruto?

00:29:29.157 --> 00:29:30.926 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah! Of course!

00:29:31.192 --> 00:29:33.428 position:16% line:83% align:start
So what are you gonna do
now that you've become

00:29:33.461 --> 00:29:35.163 position:24% line:89% align:start
my Dad's student?

00:29:35.196 --> 00:29:37.499 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll learn all about my
dad's weaknesses.

00:29:37.532 --> 00:29:41.002 position:10% line:83% align:start
What?! Look, I don't mean to
criticize you or anything...

00:29:41.036 --> 00:29:43.905 position:10% line:83% align:start
But before you challenge the
Lord Hokage, I think we'd

00:29:43.938 --> 00:29:46.173 position:30% line:83% align:start
better become
chunin at least.

00:29:46.206 --> 00:29:47.307 position:38% line:89% align:start
Get it?!

00:29:47.341 --> 00:29:49.043 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's why I wanna train!

00:29:49.076 --> 00:29:51.779 position:16% line:83% align:start
I wanna learn a lot from
Uncle Sasuke so I can show

00:29:51.812 --> 00:29:54.081 position:27% line:83% align:start
off my power to
my dad, the power

00:29:54.114 --> 00:29:56.315 position:27% line:83% align:start
that one day is
gonna topple him!

00:29:56.349 --> 00:29:58.117 position:19% line:89% align:start
You mean "our" power!

00:29:58.151 --> 00:30:01.253 position:16% line:83% align:start
Seriously, what are you
thinking with all of this?

00:30:01.286 --> 00:30:04.322 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's obvious! I'm thinkin'
we're gonna come out on top

00:30:04.356 --> 00:30:05.957 position:21% line:89% align:start
at the Chunin Exams.

00:30:10.028 --> 00:30:12.164 position:24% line:83% align:start
You know, I don't
mean to sound overly

00:30:12.196 --> 00:30:14.032 position:10% line:89% align:start
critical of you or anything.

00:30:14.066 --> 00:30:16.467 position:30% line:83% align:start
But sometimes,
you're not that bad.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.369 position:27% line:83% align:start
And please don't
forget about me, okay?

00:30:46.961 --> 00:30:49.197 position:21% line:83% align:start
I didn't expect the
chakra to be dispersed

00:30:49.229 --> 00:30:50.464 position:27% line:89% align:start
in this manner.

00:30:50.497 --> 00:30:52.499 position:19% line:83% align:start
The Divine Tree's been
cut down, and there's

00:30:52.532 --> 00:30:55.836 position:16% line:83% align:start
no sign of Kaguya. Seems
the creatures of this

00:30:55.869 --> 00:30:58.537 position:10% line:83% align:start
planet have gained knowledge
they shouldn't have.

00:31:02.042 --> 00:31:03.176 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:31:07.445 --> 00:31:10.815 position:10% line:83% align:start
We'll just have to retrieve
it one by one, then.

00:31:13.219 --> 00:31:14.385 position:35% line:89% align:start
Take this!

00:31:25.229 --> 00:31:27.097 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll send it back
twice as strong.

00:31:55.321 --> 00:31:56.589 position:27% line:89% align:start
Imagine that...

00:31:57.057 --> 00:31:59.059 position:33% line:83% align:start
High-density
chakra in humans in

00:31:59.093 --> 00:32:00.994 position:21% line:89% align:start
the form of beasts.

00:32:02.996 --> 00:32:04.396 position:19% line:89% align:start
Is that all you have?

00:32:05.131 --> 00:32:07.933 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, I'll take it. I used
most of the pills traveling

00:32:07.966 --> 00:32:09.501 position:21% line:89% align:start
through Time-Space.

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:14.572 position:13% line:83% align:start
Lord Momoshiki, there's an
even greater reverberation

00:32:14.605 --> 00:32:17.608 position:30% line:83% align:start
to the east. I
believe the massive

00:32:17.642 --> 00:32:20.845 position:19% line:83% align:start
accumulation of chakra
we seek is there.

00:32:27.484 --> 00:32:29.052 position:27% line:89% align:start
How's that, huh?

00:32:29.085 --> 00:32:31.288 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, you're able to bend
it a little bit now.

00:32:35.925 --> 00:32:37.993 position:27% line:83% align:start
Your next target
is that one.

00:32:38.261 --> 00:32:40.462 position:21% line:83% align:start
How am I supposed to
bend it that far?!

00:32:47.203 --> 00:32:49.470 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't expect an
immediate answer.

00:32:49.504 --> 00:32:50.972 position:16% line:89% align:start
Use your head a little.

00:32:53.942 --> 00:32:55.043 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I know...

00:33:05.252 --> 00:33:08.454 position:21% line:83% align:start
Boruto, you must be
victorious no matter what.

00:33:10.455 --> 00:33:12.591 position:19% line:83% align:start
When you're in a bind,
this ninja tool will

00:33:12.624 --> 00:33:14.526 position:21% line:89% align:start
come to your rescue.

00:33:17.596 --> 00:33:20.232 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's no need to
think so hard over it.

00:33:34.211 --> 00:33:36.179 position:27% line:83% align:start
 <i>I wonder if he's</i>
 <i>even gonna try?</i>

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:39.983 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>Well, he is my son.</i>
 <i>Can't be helped.</i>

00:33:43.086 --> 00:33:46.221 position:13% line:83% align:start
We'll now start the Chunin
Exams' first round.

00:33:46.989 --> 00:33:48.957 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's time for all of you to
utilize everything you've

00:33:48.991 --> 00:33:51.026 position:27% line:89% align:start
learned so far!

00:33:51.293 --> 00:33:53.262 position:10% line:89% align:start
 <i>Just watch, stupid old man.</i>

00:33:53.295 --> 00:33:55.963 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>My strength's gonna take me</i>
 <i>all the way to the top! </i>

00:33:56.998 --> 00:33:59.432 position:19% line:83% align:start
All right! We're about
to begin Round One.

00:34:02.469 --> 00:34:04.571 position:16% line:83% align:start
Each team of three will
stand on the side they

00:34:04.604 --> 00:34:06.505 position:24% line:83% align:start
believe holds the
correct answer.

00:34:06.773 --> 00:34:09.009 position:21% line:89% align:start
And the question is!

00:34:09.042 --> 00:34:12.611 position:10% line:83% align:start
In Volume 5 of the "Shinobi
Strategist Detective Story,"

00:34:12.645 --> 00:34:15.014 position:30% line:83% align:start
the following
passwords appear:

00:34:15.047 --> 00:34:18.750 position:16% line:83% align:start
Moon is day. Mountain is
river. Flower is nectar.

00:34:18.783 --> 00:34:20.518 position:30% line:89% align:start
True or false?

00:34:21.552 --> 00:34:24.088 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hey, Sarada, do
you know that book?

00:34:24.355 --> 00:34:25.489 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sort of...

00:34:25.522 --> 00:34:27.491 position:27% line:83% align:start
Except I've only
read up to the fourth

00:34:27.524 --> 00:34:29.227 position:19% line:89% align:start
volume in the series.

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:31.995 position:24% line:83% align:start
I didn't even know
there was a fifth one.

00:34:32.029 --> 00:34:33.530 position:33% line:83% align:start
Then we may
as well give up.

00:34:33.563 --> 00:34:35.365 position:19% line:83% align:start
At least give it some
thought, Mitsuki!

00:34:36.666 --> 00:34:39.535 position:10% line:83% align:start
Boruto, which answer do you
think my dad would choose?

00:34:41.604 --> 00:34:44.140 position:13% line:83% align:start
[chuckle] Probably false.
He's not obedient.

00:34:44.407 --> 00:34:46.242 position:21% line:89% align:start
Why'd you ask that?

00:34:46.275 --> 00:34:48.677 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll become Hokage by
choosing a different path

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:50.346 position:33% line:89% align:start
than my dad!

00:34:50.379 --> 00:34:52.213 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then we should go
for true, right?

00:34:52.247 --> 00:34:54.581 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Yeah! Let's go!
-Hey!

00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:59.453 position:19% line:83% align:start
All right, you've all
picked your answer.

00:34:59.486 --> 00:35:02.523 position:19% line:83% align:start
The wrong one will be
revealed soon. Remember,

00:35:02.556 --> 00:35:04.992 position:30% line:83% align:start
those who turn
black will fail.

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:08.262 position:24% line:83% align:start
What do you mean,
"turn black"?

00:35:08.295 --> 00:35:10.463 position:27% line:83% align:start
[chuckle] You'll
find out soon.

00:35:12.065 --> 00:35:13.498 position:27% line:89% align:start
The answer is...

00:35:20.605 --> 00:35:22.207 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:35:29.348 --> 00:35:31.349 position:16% line:89% align:start
Ink! It's a pool of ink!

00:35:32.116 --> 00:35:33.784 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, I get it...

00:35:34.218 --> 00:35:35.386 position:38% line:89% align:start
[scream]

00:35:39.222 --> 00:35:40.223 position:38% line:89% align:start
Damn it!

00:35:41.358 --> 00:35:42.759 position:21% line:89% align:start
 <i>Is this really it?!</i>

00:35:52.434 --> 00:35:53.435 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:36:01.175 --> 00:36:03.211 position:21% line:83% align:start
Is that the "false"
side over there?

00:36:04.611 --> 00:36:06.347 position:24% line:83% align:start
It probably didn't
matter if we chose

00:36:06.381 --> 00:36:08.115 position:21% line:89% align:start
"true" or "false..."

00:36:08.348 --> 00:36:10.484 position:16% line:83% align:start
That question was a sham
right from the start!

00:36:10.516 --> 00:36:13.253 position:19% line:83% align:start
There was never really
a fifth volume at all!

00:36:13.286 --> 00:36:15.222 position:19% line:83% align:start
He told us that those
who turn black

00:36:15.255 --> 00:36:17.123 position:24% line:89% align:start
are going to fail.

00:36:17.156 --> 00:36:19.759 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's what he said. So as
long as you don't touch the

00:36:19.792 --> 00:36:22.161 position:21% line:89% align:start
ink, you'll be okay.

00:36:22.194 --> 00:36:25.498 position:16% line:83% align:start
So like dad, an awkward
and oblivious test.

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:27.132 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:36:28.299 --> 00:36:29.768 position:27% line:89% align:start
Precisely right!

00:36:29.801 --> 00:36:32.703 position:16% line:83% align:start
You see, if you realized
your mistake above the pool

00:36:32.736 --> 00:36:35.205 position:21% line:83% align:start
of ink and then just
gave up and let the

00:36:35.239 --> 00:36:38.842 position:16% line:83% align:start
ink stain you, you don't
deserve to be a chunin.

00:36:39.575 --> 00:36:41.811 position:10% line:83% align:start
The real purpose was to see
the answer you were forced

00:36:41.844 --> 00:36:44.481 position:16% line:83% align:start
to find after being put
into a difficult situation,

00:36:44.515 --> 00:36:46.449 position:30% line:83% align:start
whether you'd
give up or not.

00:36:47.483 --> 00:36:50.353 position:19% line:83% align:start
Those who avoided the
ink answered correctly.

00:36:50.386 --> 00:36:54.089 position:16% line:83% align:start
The Chunin Exams' Round
One has now ended!

00:36:55.491 --> 00:36:57.359 position:24% line:83% align:start
The Second Round's
in three days!

00:36:57.625 --> 00:36:58.726 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes!

00:36:58.759 --> 00:36:59.827 position:35% line:89% align:start
We did it.

00:37:06.667 --> 00:37:09.303 position:24% line:83% align:start
Somehow he managed
to make it through.

00:37:13.706 --> 00:37:16.843 position:24% line:83% align:start
Boruto's team got
through round one.

00:37:17.277 --> 00:37:18.478 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:37:19.745 --> 00:37:20.846 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:37:21.314 --> 00:37:23.348 position:27% line:83% align:start
Are you thinking
about last time?

00:37:23.615 --> 00:37:24.750 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:37:25.884 --> 00:37:28.420 position:13% line:83% align:start
I know that I'm not one to
talk, but maybe you should

00:37:28.454 --> 00:37:30.588 position:19% line:83% align:start
consider giving him a
pep talk or something!

00:38:04.919 --> 00:38:07.489 position:13% line:83% align:start
Congratulations on passing
the first round. Good luck

00:38:07.522 --> 00:38:09.656 position:19% line:89% align:start
on the next one. Dad.

00:38:11.992 --> 00:38:13.594 position:35% line:89% align:start
An email?

00:38:13.861 --> 00:38:17.897 position:10% line:83% align:start
He didn't even send a Shadow
Clone?! Stupid old man...

00:38:21.934 --> 00:38:23.269 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:38:35.547 --> 00:38:38.282 position:13% line:83% align:start
Shuriken Jutsu is Sarada's
specialty, not mine, Uncle

00:38:38.316 --> 00:38:39.984 position:10% line:89% align:start
Sasuke! Everyone knows that!

00:38:40.017 --> 00:38:41.485 position:24% line:83% align:start
I mean, she's, you
know, she's your-

00:38:41.519 --> 00:38:43.487 position:24% line:89% align:start
She's an Uchiha!

00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:49.493 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, Boruto, based on your
reasoning... this jutsu should

00:38:49.527 --> 00:38:52.462 position:19% line:83% align:start
be your specialty. Is
that right, or not?

00:38:52.728 --> 00:38:55.864 position:16% line:83% align:start
I guess. That was Dad's
specialty, wasn't it?

00:38:56.332 --> 00:38:59.001 position:27% line:83% align:start
No more excuses.
Naruto can make over a

00:38:59.034 --> 00:39:01.003 position:16% line:89% align:start
thousand Shadow Clones.

00:39:01.036 --> 00:39:02.905 position:21% line:89% align:start
[growl] I know that!

00:39:04.972 --> 00:39:07.308 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>I'll blow them all away</i>
 <i>during Round Two!</i>

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:10.378 position:21% line:89% align:start
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:15.815 position:27% line:83% align:start
I guess four is
still my limit.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.690 position:19% line:83% align:start
Round Two is all about
capturing the flag. Guard

00:39:24.723 --> 00:39:26.692 position:21% line:83% align:start
your flag while you
infiltrate enemy

00:39:26.725 --> 00:39:28.427 position:16% line:89% align:start
territory to get theirs.

00:39:28.694 --> 00:39:31.430 position:16% line:83% align:start
In short, this battle is
both offensive and

00:39:31.463 --> 00:39:34.699 position:19% line:83% align:start
defensive. It's three
against three, so half the

00:39:34.732 --> 00:39:37.235 position:19% line:83% align:start
teams will be dropped
after this round.

00:40:02.057 --> 00:40:04.660 position:13% line:83% align:start
Seems most of the matches
are done already.

00:40:04.694 --> 00:40:07.829 position:10% line:89% align:start
There's just one team left.

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:11.865 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't see the
enemy, are we okay?

00:40:12.334 --> 00:40:14.868 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm guarding our flag. Just
relax and move in already!

00:40:16.337 --> 00:40:17.304 position:35% line:89% align:start
Boruto...

00:40:17.338 --> 00:40:18.439 position:19% line:89% align:start
We're counting on you!

00:40:20.374 --> 00:40:22.509 position:10% line:83% align:start
If we're going to show Lord
Seventh how strong we are,

00:40:22.543 --> 00:40:24.578 position:13% line:83% align:start
we have to make it through
this second round.

00:40:25.979 --> 00:40:28.581 position:16% line:83% align:start
[chuckle] Hey, you don't
have to remind me!

00:40:31.618 --> 00:40:33.486 position:30% line:83% align:start
Your surprise
attack didn't work.

00:40:33.752 --> 00:40:37.956 position:10% line:83% align:start
Five to three. You know who
has the edge here, right?

00:40:48.132 --> 00:40:50.334 position:19% line:89% align:start
Who has the edge now?

00:40:51.569 --> 00:40:52.969 position:41% line:89% align:start
Whoa!

00:40:54.838 --> 00:40:56.339 position:27% line:89% align:start
 <i>Don't worry, go!</i>

00:40:56.839 --> 00:40:58.308 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'll rejoin you soon!

00:41:17.692 --> 00:41:18.859 position:38% line:89% align:start
 <i>Boruto!</i>

00:41:33.105 --> 00:41:35.974 position:10% line:83% align:start
A Water Style this powerful
with no water nearby?!

00:41:36.007 --> 00:41:37.008 position:38% line:89% align:start
[scream]

00:41:51.188 --> 00:41:53.990 position:30% line:83% align:start
He even knows
Lightning Style?

00:41:58.495 --> 00:41:59.829 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm okay here, guys.

00:42:00.096 --> 00:42:01.998 position:19% line:89% align:start
Sarada, get that flag!

00:42:02.732 --> 00:42:03.899 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I'm on it.

00:42:16.678 --> 00:42:17.813 position:35% line:89% align:start
We did it!

00:42:17.845 --> 00:42:18.846 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes!

00:42:19.748 --> 00:42:20.748 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:42:22.516 --> 00:42:23.983 position:10% line:89% align:start
I guess we managed somehow.

00:42:24.017 --> 00:42:26.620 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yeah, it was a
piece of cake.

00:42:26.654 --> 00:42:29.656 position:10% line:83% align:start
You know, Boruto. I believe
that you really could become

00:42:29.689 --> 00:42:31.558 position:21% line:89% align:start
the Hokage one day.

00:42:31.591 --> 00:42:32.325 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:42:32.359 --> 00:42:34.427 position:24% line:83% align:start
Excuse me! That's
gonna be me!

00:42:34.461 --> 00:42:35.894 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:42:45.738 --> 00:42:46.839 position:27% line:89% align:start
Wow. He's good.

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:50.641 position:13% line:83% align:start
Leave it to Lord Seventh's
son! I couldn't even see him

00:42:50.675 --> 00:42:52.577 position:24% line:89% align:start
weaving any signs!

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:55.847 position:19% line:83% align:start
Okay, that makes four
teams. The round's done!

00:42:56.714 --> 00:42:58.849 position:16% line:83% align:start
Thank you, Shino. You've
really been a big help.

00:42:58.882 --> 00:43:00.484 position:19% line:89% align:start
He got through again.

00:43:00.517 --> 00:43:02.652 position:27% line:83% align:start
It seems he used
it this time around.

00:43:02.686 --> 00:43:04.755 position:30% line:83% align:start
Great, did you
get footage?

00:43:04.788 --> 00:43:05.655 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:43:07.089 --> 00:43:09.125 position:16% line:89% align:start
Up next the third test!

00:43:09.158 --> 00:43:10.659 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:43:12.661 --> 00:43:15.698 position:33% line:83% align:start
Listen! This
means at last...

00:43:15.731 --> 00:43:18.932 position:10% line:83% align:start
Lord Seventh will get to see
just how strong we are!

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.934 position:16% line:89% align:start
So show some excitement!

00:43:20.968 --> 00:43:22.504 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yep, I got it!

00:43:27.808 --> 00:43:28.809 position:33% line:89% align:start
Thought so.

00:43:29.877 --> 00:43:32.813 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your eyes they're even
bluer than the Seventh's.

00:43:34.715 --> 00:43:35.982 position:38% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:43:36.015 --> 00:43:37.183 position:41% line:89% align:start
Argh!

00:43:38.184 --> 00:43:39.886 position:13% line:89% align:start
They are! I'm sure of it!

00:43:39.918 --> 00:43:41.920 position:27% line:83% align:start
You do pay close
attention, don't you?

00:43:41.953 --> 00:43:44.956 position:16% line:83% align:start
Ask him to show you next
time. Lord Seventh is nice.

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:46.958 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm sure he
wouldn't say no.

00:43:46.992 --> 00:43:48.493 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:43:58.001 --> 00:44:00.203 position:24% line:89% align:start
[scream] Uh, yes?

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:08.043 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm impressed.

00:44:08.076 --> 00:44:09.178 position:33% line:89% align:start
'Bout what?

00:44:09.211 --> 00:44:11.246 position:27% line:83% align:start
About Boruto and
his team, of course.

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.882 position:27% line:83% align:start
They've cleared
Round Two.

00:44:12.916 --> 00:44:14.918 position:27% line:89% align:start
Huh. They have?

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:17.084 position:21% line:89% align:start
[sigh] Well, see ya.

00:44:18.687 --> 00:44:20.522 position:27% line:83% align:start
Is that all you
came to tell me?

00:44:20.556 --> 00:44:22.990 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well, it is important news.

00:44:24.125 --> 00:44:27.027 position:10% line:83% align:start
By the way, Shikadai's team
made it, too. We just might

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:29.697 position:30% line:83% align:start
see a showdown
between our sons!

00:44:35.302 --> 00:44:36.503 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes!

00:44:43.709 --> 00:44:45.578 position:24% line:83% align:start
Will it take much
longer to decipher?

00:44:45.845 --> 00:44:48.848 position:24% line:83% align:start
Maybe, looks like
they hit a snag.

00:44:48.881 --> 00:44:50.648 position:10% line:89% align:start
Okay, I'll come back later.

00:44:50.916 --> 00:44:51.783 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sasuke...

00:44:53.184 --> 00:44:55.820 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've heard that you've
been training him.

00:44:56.821 --> 00:44:58.088 position:21% line:89% align:start
Did Boruto tell you?

00:44:58.121 --> 00:45:00.257 position:21% line:89% align:start
No, Konohamaru did.

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:01.091 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:45:02.259 --> 00:45:04.595 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, maybe you
were right after all...

00:45:04.628 --> 00:45:07.163 position:30% line:83% align:start
The soul of a
shinobi never changes.

00:45:09.967 --> 00:45:12.235 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's true. That's
what I believe.

00:45:16.772 --> 00:45:17.907 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm home.

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:19.775 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey! Welcome back!

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:23.645 position:27% line:83% align:start
Congratulations,
Big Brother!

00:45:23.678 --> 00:45:26.046 position:27% line:83% align:start
[chuckle] I just
passed Round Two.

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:27.816 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's no big deal,
you know!

00:45:27.849 --> 00:45:29.116 position:24% line:89% align:start
Did you get hurt?

00:45:29.149 --> 00:45:30.184 position:19% line:89% align:start
Nah, I'm totally fine!

00:45:30.217 --> 00:45:34.053 position:13% line:83% align:start
But I'm feeling tired, so
I'm going to my room.

00:45:36.055 --> 00:45:37.958 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, and don't worry,
I'm good on dinner.

00:45:57.141 --> 00:45:58.010 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:03.113 position:19% line:83% align:start
Uh, hey, I told you I
didn't need any dinner!

00:46:05.883 --> 00:46:06.851 position:33% line:89% align:start
What is it?

00:46:12.321 --> 00:46:13.690 position:21% line:89% align:start
Dad, what are you-?!

00:46:18.427 --> 00:46:20.362 position:35% line:89% align:start
So, uh...

00:46:20.829 --> 00:46:23.097 position:24% line:83% align:start
I heard you passed
the Second Round.

00:46:23.398 --> 00:46:24.867 position:35% line:89% align:start
Y-Yeah...

00:46:27.335 --> 00:46:28.369 position:38% line:89% align:start
I, uh...

00:46:35.742 --> 00:46:36.777 position:44% line:89% align:start
Dad?

00:46:46.319 --> 00:46:48.688 position:27% line:83% align:start
If it's nothing,
then can you just go?

00:46:52.123 --> 00:46:53.025 position:41% line:89% align:start
You...

00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:00.331 position:30% line:89% align:start
You did great.

00:47:05.436 --> 00:47:06.804 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, see you later.

00:47:08.038 --> 00:47:09.907 position:27% line:83% align:start
You came up just
to say that?

00:47:11.107 --> 00:47:12.876 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's important, you know?

00:47:16.346 --> 00:47:18.948 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's the most
important thing.

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:23.251 position:24% line:89% align:start
One more thing...

00:47:23.719 --> 00:47:24.920 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, what's that?

00:47:27.389 --> 00:47:29.091 position:16% line:89% align:start
Do not lose to Shikadai!

00:47:38.966 --> 00:47:40.400 position:16% line:89% align:start
[chuckle] Like I'd lose!

00:47:45.205 --> 00:47:46.373 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll be watching.

00:47:49.009 --> 00:47:49.943 position:38% line:89% align:start
See ya!

00:47:57.281 --> 00:47:59.752 position:27% line:83% align:start
He could've just
emailed me to say that.

00:48:15.032 --> 00:48:16.198 position:27% line:89% align:start
Stupid old man.

00:48:54.834 --> 00:48:56.069 position:10% line:89% align:start
All right, it's almost time.

00:48:56.102 --> 00:48:57.870 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:48:59.404 --> 00:49:02.007 position:16% line:83% align:start
As I am sure you are all
aware, Round Three consists

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:04.076 position:19% line:89% align:start
of individual matches!

00:49:04.109 --> 00:49:07.211 position:10% line:83% align:start
You may even face a teammate
who knows your skills!

00:49:07.244 --> 00:49:09.413 position:30% line:83% align:start
You will have
three matches.

00:49:09.447 --> 00:49:12.483 position:16% line:83% align:start
And then, the winners in
Blocks A, B, and C will

00:49:12.516 --> 00:49:14.284 position:33% line:83% align:start
battle in a
three-way final.

00:49:15.285 --> 00:49:16.854 position:30% line:89% align:start
Are you ready?

00:49:18.055 --> 00:49:19.055 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes!

00:49:22.459 --> 00:49:25.794 position:19% line:83% align:start
And now Round Three of
the Chunin Exams begins!

00:49:27.097 --> 00:49:28.497 position:33% line:83% align:start
Challengers,
step forward!

00:49:30.599 --> 00:49:32.500 position:19% line:83% align:start
Boruto Uzumaki of the
Hidden Leaf versus

00:49:32.534 --> 00:49:34.903 position:33% line:83% align:start
Yurui of the
Hidden Cloud!

00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:37.538 position:27% line:89% align:start
The first match!

00:49:37.572 --> 00:49:38.773 position:41% line:89% align:start
Begin!

00:49:45.612 --> 00:49:48.048 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're about to get
smoked wholesale, Boruto!

00:49:48.281 --> 00:49:50.484 position:16% line:89% align:start
Huh?! Smoked wholesale?

00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:53.220 position:30% line:83% align:start
It means that
you're gonna lose!

00:49:54.087 --> 00:49:55.855 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then just say that! You
don't have to beat around

00:49:55.888 --> 00:49:57.323 position:24% line:89% align:start
the bush so much!

00:49:57.356 --> 00:50:01.026 position:16% line:83% align:start
Maybe I'll stop beating
around the bush right now.

00:50:04.063 --> 00:50:05.463 position:24% line:89% align:start
Like I'd let you!

00:50:09.567 --> 00:50:11.102 position:30% line:89% align:start
They explode?!

00:50:16.406 --> 00:50:17.107 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:50:26.983 --> 00:50:28.416 position:30% line:89% align:start
You did great.

00:50:34.456 --> 00:50:37.192 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm not about to lose here!

00:50:44.598 --> 00:50:45.200 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:50:46.367 --> 00:50:47.535 position:10% line:89% align:start
Kid can't even aim right...

00:50:58.544 --> 00:51:00.379 position:27% line:83% align:start
How did he bend
it that much?

00:51:05.918 --> 00:51:07.953 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sorry, but it looks
like you're the one

00:51:07.986 --> 00:51:09.453 position:21% line:89% align:start
who got smoked here!

00:51:09.922 --> 00:51:12.090 position:24% line:89% align:start
Um, was it Charai?

00:51:12.323 --> 00:51:13.858 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's Yurui.

00:51:15.392 --> 00:51:18.162 position:16% line:83% align:start
The winner is the Hidden
Leaf's Boruto Uzumaki!

00:51:18.196 --> 00:51:19.362 position:35% line:89% align:start
[cheering]

00:51:19.396 --> 00:51:21.132 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah! He won! He won!

00:51:22.933 --> 00:51:25.001 position:33% line:83% align:start
Nicely done.
That kid's good.

00:51:26.002 --> 00:51:28.004 position:16% line:89% align:start
All right, I'll win too!

00:51:28.038 --> 00:51:29.471 position:44% line:89% align:start
Cha!

00:51:33.075 --> 00:51:35.343 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, yeah! That's
my girl! All right!

00:51:56.495 --> 00:51:57.630 position:24% line:83% align:start
The seventh match!
Begin!

00:52:05.037 --> 00:52:06.239 position:27% line:89% align:start
Shadow Clones?!

00:52:37.499 --> 00:52:40.335 position:10% line:83% align:start
You know, it would be great
if you just gave up now.

00:52:45.706 --> 00:52:46.674 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:53:03.189 --> 00:53:04.124 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:53:05.292 --> 00:53:06.425 position:27% line:89% align:start
Fine, I give up.

00:53:07.059 --> 00:53:07.927 position:33% line:89% align:start
[chuckling]

00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:10.162 position:24% line:83% align:start
Doesn't this scene
look familiar, guys?

00:53:10.195 --> 00:53:13.966 position:13% line:83% align:start
Soon now, it's going to be
our turn to take the stage.

00:53:14.333 --> 00:53:16.268 position:19% line:83% align:start
That fool's good with
that ninja tool, and

00:53:16.302 --> 00:53:17.735 position:19% line:89% align:start
keeps it hidden well.

00:53:23.607 --> 00:53:26.109 position:16% line:83% align:start
The winner is the Hidden
Leaf's Boruto Uzumaki!

00:53:26.476 --> 00:53:28.745 position:13% line:89% align:start
He moves on to the final!

00:53:29.346 --> 00:53:30.747 position:27% line:89% align:start
[laughter] Yes!

00:53:32.748 --> 00:53:34.184 position:35% line:89% align:start
Amazing...

00:53:35.185 --> 00:53:36.420 position:16% line:89% align:start
What's the matter, dear?

00:53:37.086 --> 00:53:40.156 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hinata, 'round his arm.
Use your Byakugan.

00:53:46.328 --> 00:53:48.529 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is what we've
deciphered from the scroll.

00:53:48.562 --> 00:53:51.066 position:21% line:83% align:start
Seems my suspicions
were right on the mark.

00:53:51.333 --> 00:53:52.566 position:27% line:89% align:start
Something wrong?

00:53:52.599 --> 00:53:55.302 position:19% line:83% align:start
We have to let Naruto
know immediately.

00:53:55.337 --> 00:53:57.571 position:19% line:83% align:start
We're going to need to
postpone the exams.

00:54:00.673 --> 00:54:01.841 position:41% line:89% align:start
Well?

00:54:01.874 --> 00:54:05.446 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's some ninja tool. He has
it attached onto his arm...

00:54:05.478 --> 00:54:07.313 position:27% line:89% align:start
Is that how he-?

00:54:09.315 --> 00:54:10.582 position:16% line:89% align:start
What's with the Hokage?

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:13.419 position:13% line:83% align:start
I bet he's so proud of his
son, he couldn't help going

00:54:13.453 --> 00:54:15.187 position:21% line:89% align:start
down there himself!

00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:17.289 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now there's a doting
parent for you!

00:54:18.156 --> 00:54:19.657 position:35% line:89% align:start
[giggling]

00:54:20.825 --> 00:54:22.526 position:19% line:89% align:start
Dad, did you see me?!

00:54:24.429 --> 00:54:26.330 position:13% line:89% align:start
Next up's the final round!

00:54:42.845 --> 00:54:44.546 position:16% line:89% align:start
Go on. Explain yourself.

00:54:49.451 --> 00:54:50.685 position:35% line:89% align:start
This is...

00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:53.554 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is prohibited
in the Chunin Exams.

00:54:54.489 --> 00:54:57.458 position:13% line:83% align:start
Using a ninja tool instead
of your own chakra defeats

00:54:57.492 --> 00:54:59.494 position:24% line:83% align:start
the purpose of the
Chunin Exams, to

00:54:59.526 --> 00:55:01.462 position:21% line:89% align:start
nurture new shinobi.

00:55:02.662 --> 00:55:05.298 position:21% line:83% align:start
Lee, Boruto Uzumaki
is disqualified.

00:55:06.133 --> 00:55:07.666 position:24% line:83% align:start
Please change the
winner to Shikadai.

00:55:08.768 --> 00:55:10.536 position:24% line:83% align:start
He's been exposed!
Well, we have no

00:55:10.569 --> 00:55:12.438 position:19% line:89% align:start
choice but to act now.

00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:16.608 position:16% line:83% align:start
Boruto Uzumaki has been
disqualified for using an

00:55:16.641 --> 00:55:18.244 position:21% line:89% align:start
illegal ninja tool!

00:55:19.144 --> 00:55:21.112 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wow, that sure is a
big rule to break...

00:55:21.146 --> 00:55:24.581 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, man. That idiot kid's
dragging the Hokage's

00:55:24.615 --> 00:55:26.284 position:16% line:89% align:start
name through the mud...

00:55:26.317 --> 00:55:28.286 position:19% line:89% align:start
What!? You're kidding!

00:55:28.319 --> 00:55:30.187 position:19% line:89% align:start
Where did he get that?

00:55:32.322 --> 00:55:33.524 position:35% line:89% align:start
Boruto...

00:55:36.626 --> 00:55:38.228 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're no longer
a ninja, either.

00:55:39.595 --> 00:55:41.431 position:30% line:83% align:start
What happened
to Big Brother?

00:55:41.464 --> 00:55:42.799 position:16% line:89% align:start
Did he do something bad?

00:55:46.202 --> 00:55:47.403 position:35% line:89% align:start
Boruto...

00:55:49.671 --> 00:55:51.106 position:30% line:89% align:start
Come with me.

00:55:52.207 --> 00:55:53.542 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's the middle of
the Chunin Exams.

00:55:53.574 --> 00:55:55.377 position:24% line:89% align:start
We'll talk later.

00:55:56.944 --> 00:55:59.413 position:30% line:83% align:start
Really? You'll
talk to me later?

00:55:59.448 --> 00:56:01.614 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah, right. Like you
actually make the

00:56:01.648 --> 00:56:03.716 position:19% line:89% align:start
time to do that, dad!

00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:05.585 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you'd talked to
me before this...

00:56:07.488 --> 00:56:08.321 position:41% line:89% align:start
I...

00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:10.423 position:35% line:89% align:start
Then I...

00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:12.158 position:30% line:89% align:start
I wouldn't...

00:56:12.192 --> 00:56:14.494 position:27% line:83% align:start
...have ended up
in this damn mess!

00:56:20.232 --> 00:56:21.500 position:19% line:89% align:start
He's right, you know.

00:56:21.732 --> 00:56:24.236 position:19% line:83% align:start
Boruto wasn't able to
win, and we're all very

00:56:24.269 --> 00:56:27.672 position:24% line:83% align:start
disappointed about
that, Lord Seventh.

00:56:27.705 --> 00:56:30.640 position:19% line:83% align:start
To be honest, I really
wanted to make this

00:56:30.674 --> 00:56:32.609 position:13% line:89% align:start
announcement after he won.

00:56:32.642 --> 00:56:33.710 position:35% line:89% align:start
You guys!

00:56:33.743 --> 00:56:37.347 position:10% line:83% align:start
Listen, everyone! Yes, it's
true that Boruto used a

00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:39.249 position:19% line:89% align:start
Scientific Ninja Tool!

00:56:39.282 --> 00:56:41.617 position:19% line:83% align:start
I know such things are
prohibited here, but there's

00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:44.287 position:21% line:83% align:start
no denying that this
Tool made it possible

00:56:44.321 --> 00:56:46.255 position:10% line:89% align:start
for him to reach this point!

00:56:47.523 --> 00:56:48.757 position:35% line:89% align:start
Katasuke!

00:56:48.791 --> 00:56:51.427 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's why, Five Kage and
all those from other

00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:53.596 position:24% line:83% align:start
villages, this was
the perfect venue to

00:56:53.628 --> 00:56:54.762 position:33% line:89% align:start
demonstrate-

00:57:00.435 --> 00:57:02.604 position:30% line:83% align:start
Get behind me,
now. Stay put.

00:57:04.004 --> 00:57:07.174 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey, what's with you two,
barging in like that?!

00:57:07.407 --> 00:57:08.475 position:19% line:89% align:start
Stop! Just stay back!

00:57:08.509 --> 00:57:11.512 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm using this arena to show
off my invention, and-

00:57:14.548 --> 00:57:16.182 position:33% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:57:29.727 --> 00:57:30.828 position:16% line:89% align:start
Prevent any casualties.

00:57:54.750 --> 00:57:57.286 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can see the fox
with my Byakugan.

00:57:57.952 --> 00:58:00.688 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's dangerous! Go with the
others! Get outta here!

00:58:13.633 --> 00:58:15.368 position:24% line:83% align:start
This child is the
last one left.

00:58:15.402 --> 00:58:17.270 position:30% line:83% align:start
Get her out of
here to safety.

00:58:17.304 --> 00:58:18.971 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm just gonna go
check for others.

00:58:19.972 --> 00:58:21.474 position:38% line:89% align:start
Sarada!

00:58:33.618 --> 00:58:34.586 position:33% line:89% align:start
Whoa! Dad?!

00:58:34.619 --> 00:58:36.020 position:27% line:83% align:start
You don't appear
to be injured.

00:58:37.488 --> 00:58:39.390 position:13% line:89% align:start
Here's payback for before!

00:58:56.004 --> 00:58:57.473 position:27% line:89% align:start
[attacking yell]

00:59:22.495 --> 00:59:23.895 position:21% line:89% align:start
That was too close!

00:59:24.796 --> 00:59:26.031 position:13% line:89% align:start
Boruto! Are you all right?

00:59:26.064 --> 00:59:28.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I'm fine.
Glad you're safe.

00:59:30.035 --> 00:59:31.403 position:33% line:89% align:start
How trivial.

00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:37.542 position:24% line:89% align:start
He absorbed that?!

00:59:38.075 --> 00:59:39.076 position:35% line:89% align:start
Kinshiki.

00:59:39.577 --> 00:59:40.611 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:59:44.047 --> 00:59:46.082 position:27% line:83% align:start
We can't use our
powers right here.

00:59:46.116 --> 00:59:48.084 position:27% line:83% align:start
Everyone'll get
dragged in.

00:59:48.118 --> 00:59:50.453 position:24% line:83% align:start
It seems like I'm
the one they're after.

00:59:50.487 --> 00:59:51.987 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll try to lure them away.

00:59:52.021 --> 00:59:54.424 position:10% line:89% align:start
Tell me, who are you guys?!

00:59:54.691 --> 00:59:57.426 position:16% line:83% align:start
I am Kinshiki Otsutsuki.
And this is Lord

00:59:57.459 --> 00:59:59.928 position:21% line:89% align:start
Momoshiki Otsutsuki.

00:59:59.962 --> 01:00:01.963 position:27% line:83% align:start
Just what do you
want with me?

01:00:01.996 --> 01:00:04.600 position:16% line:83% align:start
We'll turn the scattered
chakra into one fruit and

01:00:04.633 --> 01:00:08.403 position:13% line:83% align:start
finish what Kaguya failed
to do on this seedbed.

01:00:08.436 --> 01:00:10.971 position:13% line:83% align:start
The scroll said these guys
would come to retrieve the

01:00:11.004 --> 01:00:13.775 position:16% line:83% align:start
chakra from the fruit of
the Divine Tree, which is

01:00:13.807 --> 01:00:17.110 position:16% line:83% align:start
why Kaguya was amassing
an army of White Zetsu.

01:00:17.144 --> 01:00:19.112 position:10% line:89% align:start
First Kaguya and now this.

01:00:19.146 --> 01:00:21.615 position:19% line:89% align:start
And this fruit stuff?

01:00:21.648 --> 01:00:23.750 position:27% line:83% align:start
They want to use
it to make pills.

01:00:23.784 --> 01:00:24.917 position:41% line:89% align:start
Pills?

01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:26.652 position:21% line:89% align:start
A kind of medicine.

01:00:26.686 --> 01:00:30.122 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's right. As long as we
have this, we remain young,

01:00:30.156 --> 01:00:32.725 position:13% line:89% align:start
immortal, and invincible!

01:00:32.758 --> 01:00:35.493 position:13% line:89% align:start
You poor, awkward humans.

01:00:35.527 --> 01:00:38.063 position:21% line:83% align:start
Unless you train and
persevere endlessly and

01:00:38.096 --> 01:00:40.964 position:27% line:83% align:start
pointlessly you
get nowhere at all!

01:00:40.998 --> 01:00:44.669 position:16% line:83% align:start
But me? Just watch! With
this pill I can acquire true

01:00:44.703 --> 01:00:48.739 position:19% line:83% align:start
power instantly, with
no effort whatsoever!

01:00:48.772 --> 01:00:51.442 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't make me laugh!
True power's something

01:00:51.475 --> 01:00:52.776 position:24% line:89% align:start
you have to earn!

01:00:52.810 --> 01:00:56.479 position:16% line:83% align:start
Vulgar creatures such as
you wouldn't understand.

01:00:56.512 --> 01:00:58.648 position:19% line:89% align:start
What will you do now?

01:00:58.681 --> 01:01:00.949 position:27% line:83% align:start
I didn't want to
soil my cloak, but it

01:01:00.982 --> 01:01:02.785 position:19% line:89% align:start
seems I shall have to.

01:01:02.819 --> 01:01:05.554 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'll rearrange this seedbed
and make it beautiful

01:01:05.587 --> 01:01:07.789 position:13% line:89% align:start
despite these annoyances.

01:01:11.793 --> 01:01:13.829 position:27% line:83% align:start
Here's a jutsu I
acquired earlier.

01:01:23.002 --> 01:01:23.870 position:38% line:89% align:start
No way.

01:01:53.797 --> 01:01:54.930 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's meaningless.

01:02:11.847 --> 01:02:13.848 position:13% line:89% align:start
Whoa, what is all of this?

01:02:14.883 --> 01:02:16.984 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>I didn't know Dad had</i>
 <i>this kind of power!</i>

01:02:25.091 --> 01:02:26.058 position:35% line:89% align:start
Have this!

01:02:26.092 --> 01:02:27.126 position:35% line:89% align:start
And this!

01:02:32.265 --> 01:02:35.635 position:13% line:83% align:start
If the real you goes down,
then it's gonna be all over.

01:02:36.168 --> 01:02:37.670 position:10% line:89% align:start
Thanks for the help, Sasuke.

01:02:43.275 --> 01:02:44.876 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughter]

01:02:55.619 --> 01:02:56.654 position:35% line:89% align:start
Naruto...

01:03:12.267 --> 01:03:13.869 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughter]

01:03:14.603 --> 01:03:16.504 position:19% line:89% align:start
After this, it's over!

01:03:17.338 --> 01:03:19.207 position:10% line:89% align:start
But, you must not die, Fox.

01:03:25.979 --> 01:03:28.014 position:10% line:89% align:start
Sasuke, take care of them.

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:34.921 position:33% line:89% align:start
Understood.

01:03:36.857 --> 01:03:38.257 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Dad!
-Uncle!

01:03:40.726 --> 01:03:42.728 position:21% line:83% align:start
Let's do it, Kurama!
You'd better not be

01:03:42.761 --> 01:03:44.128 position:24% line:89% align:start
out of shape now!

01:03:44.162 --> 01:03:47.732 position:13% line:83% align:start
Ha! Don't be foolish! I'm
always ready to go!

01:03:47.765 --> 01:03:50.067 position:30% line:89% align:start
Right! [yell]

01:03:59.676 --> 01:04:01.310 position:24% line:89% align:start
[determined roar]

01:04:22.731 --> 01:04:25.232 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>Listen, he was full of</i>
 <i>weaknesses. He was a</i>

01:04:25.266 --> 01:04:27.001 position:24% line:89% align:start
 <i>good-for-nothing. </i>

01:04:27.033 --> 01:04:29.837 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>But he pulled himself up</i>
 <i>with his own strength</i>

01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:31.604 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>and became the Hokage. </i>

01:04:32.672 --> 01:04:35.675 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>What you need to know now</i>
 <i>isn't the current Naruto,</i>

01:04:35.708 --> 01:04:38.277 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>but the Naruto who</i>
 <i>made it this far.</i>

01:04:43.815 --> 01:04:44.917 position:38% line:89% align:start
Dad, no!

01:04:54.026 --> 01:04:55.593 position:19% line:89% align:start
Finally, you're awake!

01:04:58.395 --> 01:04:59.897 position:30% line:89% align:start
The hospital?

01:05:00.163 --> 01:05:01.264 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

01:05:01.298 --> 01:05:03.199 position:13% line:89% align:start
Everyone was brought here.

01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:05.167 position:33% line:83% align:start
Lord Seventh
protected all of us.

01:05:07.202 --> 01:05:08.672 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, I see...

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:10.239 position:16% line:89% align:start
So, then, everyone is-

01:05:10.272 --> 01:05:11.206 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mommy!

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.675 position:35% line:89% align:start
Himawari!

01:05:14.977 --> 01:05:15.911 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hinata!

01:05:15.945 --> 01:05:17.813 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's me! Can you hear me?

01:05:17.846 --> 01:05:18.814 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mom!

01:05:18.847 --> 01:05:21.082 position:13% line:89% align:start
She'll be fine. It's okay.

01:05:21.115 --> 01:05:22.650 position:21% line:89% align:start
What happened, Mom?!

01:05:24.819 --> 01:05:26.353 position:13% line:89% align:start
She charged in after him.

01:05:26.386 --> 01:05:28.022 position:21% line:89% align:start
Why?! That's crazy!

01:05:29.857 --> 01:05:31.191 position:27% line:83% align:start
She tried to get
Naruto back...

01:05:36.095 --> 01:05:37.898 position:41% line:89% align:start
Dad...

01:05:57.048 --> 01:05:58.049 position:35% line:89% align:start
Boruto...

01:06:01.952 --> 01:06:02.953 position:35% line:89% align:start
Boruto...

01:07:10.413 --> 01:07:13.884 position:10% line:83% align:start
When Dad was a kid, Grandpa
Hokage wasn't even alive!

01:07:13.917 --> 01:07:16.452 position:10% line:83% align:start
So I guess Dad's just lucky
that he never had to

01:07:16.485 --> 01:07:20.022 position:16% line:83% align:start
experience the "joy" of
having a parent around!

01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:22.992 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why does my dad have
to be the Hokage?!

01:07:23.258 --> 01:07:26.027 position:16% line:83% align:start
He just sits at his desk
all day long, acting bossy!

01:07:26.394 --> 01:07:28.163 position:21% line:89% align:start
Anyone can do that!

01:08:18.842 --> 01:08:21.777 position:19% line:89% align:start
Man I am so... uncool.

01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:25.914 position:21% line:89% align:start
You got that right.

01:08:28.016 --> 01:08:30.384 position:19% line:83% align:start
At the Exams, everyone
scorned you. You were

01:08:30.418 --> 01:08:32.386 position:27% line:83% align:start
stripped of your
headband and can't even

01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:35.056 position:27% line:83% align:start
call yourself a
shinobi right now.

01:08:35.089 --> 01:08:38.458 position:16% line:83% align:start
On top of that, you made
your little sister cry, your

01:08:38.492 --> 01:08:41.095 position:21% line:83% align:start
mother's been hurt,
and your father is gone.

01:08:41.129 --> 01:08:44.263 position:19% line:83% align:start
Without the sister who
adores you and the mother

01:08:44.296 --> 01:08:46.565 position:21% line:83% align:start
who worries so much
about you, you'd be

01:08:46.599 --> 01:08:49.268 position:24% line:83% align:start
just like how your
father used to be.

01:08:51.403 --> 01:08:53.304 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well? What now?

01:08:59.377 --> 01:09:00.945 position:30% line:89% align:start
So, my Dad...

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:05.449 position:27% line:83% align:start
Can you tell me
what he did?

01:09:07.051 --> 01:09:08.585 position:21% line:83% align:start
So it's not just his
weaknesses you're

01:09:08.619 --> 01:09:10.854 position:24% line:89% align:start
interested in now.

01:09:11.121 --> 01:09:12.489 position:24% line:89% align:start
Ask him yourself.

01:09:12.523 --> 01:09:13.490 position:41% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

01:09:13.524 --> 01:09:16.526 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm going to rescue him.
I can sense his chakra.

01:09:16.559 --> 01:09:19.428 position:27% line:83% align:start
In other words,
he's still alive.

01:09:19.896 --> 01:09:22.598 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't get it, Uncle
Sasuke. Why are you

01:09:22.632 --> 01:09:24.901 position:30% line:83% align:start
even bothering
with me at all?

01:09:25.902 --> 01:09:28.037 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're actually quite
a strong shinobi.

01:09:29.037 --> 01:09:31.506 position:19% line:83% align:start
I may have lost to him
but you can become

01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:33.875 position:13% line:89% align:start
someone who surpasses him.

01:09:33.909 --> 01:09:36.044 position:27% line:83% align:start
But how are you
able to tell that?!

01:09:36.077 --> 01:09:39.113 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, you are his
son, aren't you?

01:09:39.146 --> 01:09:41.148 position:30% line:83% align:start
And my number
one student.

01:09:41.182 --> 01:09:45.052 position:16% line:83% align:start
But maybe even more than
that you're a worse loser

01:09:45.085 --> 01:09:46.953 position:19% line:89% align:start
than Naruto ever was.

01:09:47.221 --> 01:09:49.489 position:27% line:89% align:start
What? A loser?!

01:09:50.190 --> 01:09:52.058 position:27% line:89% align:start
Whaddaya mean?!

01:09:52.091 --> 01:09:55.094 position:24% line:83% align:start
All I mean is that
you hate to lose.

01:10:03.035 --> 01:10:05.304 position:13% line:83% align:start
Aren't you two forgetting
about the rest of us?

01:10:05.603 --> 01:10:08.039 position:19% line:83% align:start
Look, if we don't help
out, we'd disgrace the

01:10:08.072 --> 01:10:10.208 position:10% line:89% align:start
reputation of the Five Kage.

01:10:10.241 --> 01:10:11.976 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah! Let's do it!

01:10:12.009 --> 01:10:14.644 position:30% line:83% align:start
Wow, so cool!
The Five Kage!

01:10:14.678 --> 01:10:18.048 position:16% line:83% align:start
[chuckle] You look just
like the old Naruto...

01:10:18.081 --> 01:10:20.516 position:16% line:89% align:start
I feel my power surging.

01:10:20.984 --> 01:10:23.320 position:24% line:83% align:start
No, there's still
something that's missing.

01:10:28.657 --> 01:10:29.658 position:35% line:89% align:start
This is--!

01:10:35.097 --> 01:10:37.265 position:19% line:83% align:start
With my Rinnegan, the
number of shinobi I can

01:10:37.298 --> 01:10:39.466 position:10% line:89% align:start
send after them is limited.

01:10:39.499 --> 01:10:42.369 position:16% line:83% align:start
Considering our present
battle strength, this is the

01:10:42.402 --> 01:10:45.606 position:27% line:83% align:start
best we can do.
Take care of Naruto.

01:10:48.642 --> 01:10:50.010 position:38% line:89% align:start
Boruto!

01:10:52.545 --> 01:10:53.412 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mom!

01:10:56.582 --> 01:10:57.950 position:38% line:89% align:start
Boruto!

01:11:25.141 --> 01:11:26.408 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna go now.

01:11:29.345 --> 01:11:30.213 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

01:11:37.418 --> 01:11:40.454 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now you're finally acting
like a shinobi. Let's go!

01:11:42.324 --> 01:11:44.625 position:19% line:83% align:start
Sarada, Mitsuki, take
care of everyone here!

01:11:49.596 --> 01:11:50.463 position:35% line:89% align:start
Boruto...

01:11:51.198 --> 01:11:52.599 position:19% line:89% align:start
Take care of your dad.

01:11:59.605 --> 01:12:01.073 position:21% line:89% align:start
Damn it, not them...

01:12:18.655 --> 01:12:21.291 position:33% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

01:12:26.163 --> 01:12:27.563 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's taking too long.

01:12:30.367 --> 01:12:31.667 position:24% line:89% align:start
Sorry about that.

01:12:32.735 --> 01:12:37.406 position:21% line:83% align:start
You see... It's just
that... We ninja...

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:40.241 position:27% line:83% align:start
...don't like to
make things easy.

01:12:42.811 --> 01:12:44.012 position:30% line:89% align:start
Let's do it!

01:12:51.819 --> 01:12:54.254 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't even think about
trying to escape.

01:12:54.288 --> 01:12:56.290 position:19% line:89% align:start
You vulgar creatures.

01:13:00.093 --> 01:13:01.794 position:21% line:89% align:start
Sasuke! And Boruto!

01:13:03.495 --> 01:13:05.530 position:27% line:83% align:start
But why are you
wearing all that?

01:13:05.797 --> 01:13:09.534 position:13% line:83% align:start
Things happened, and well
he's now become a shinobi.

01:13:13.537 --> 01:13:15.806 position:16% line:83% align:start
[chuckling] I feel like
I'm looking at my own

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:18.075 position:21% line:89% align:start
Shadow Clone, here!

01:13:18.309 --> 01:13:20.478 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do I look at little
cooler at least?

01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:22.380 position:21% line:89% align:start
Better than before!

01:13:23.414 --> 01:13:25.316 position:30% line:83% align:start
Before, so you
have been paying

01:13:25.349 --> 01:13:26.683 position:16% line:89% align:start
a little attention, huh?

01:13:29.719 --> 01:13:31.054 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry...

01:13:32.188 --> 01:13:33.189 position:27% line:89% align:start
For everything.

01:13:35.191 --> 01:13:36.191 position:33% line:89% align:start
From now on-

01:13:36.225 --> 01:13:37.659 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's fine the way it was.

01:13:38.827 --> 01:13:41.796 position:16% line:83% align:start
But, when you're around,
instead of lectures.

01:13:41.829 --> 01:13:44.433 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'd really like you
to tell me stories

01:13:44.466 --> 01:13:45.767 position:19% line:89% align:start
about your past, okay?

01:13:47.635 --> 01:13:48.836 position:38% line:89% align:start
Sure...

You're cornered.

01:13:59.712 --> 01:14:01.448 position:21% line:89% align:start
Speak for yourself.

01:14:01.481 --> 01:14:02.648 position:30% line:89% align:start
You little--!

01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:09.388 position:13% line:89% align:start

Ash Stone Sealing Jutsu!

You go! We'll
hold him here!

01:14:28.906 --> 01:14:29.672 position:24% line:89% align:start
Sorry we're late!

01:14:29.705 --> 01:14:32.276 position:24% line:83% align:start
Naruto! Don't use
ninjutsu on him!

01:14:36.846 --> 01:14:40.149 position:13% line:83% align:start
You absorb jutsu, and then
release it, don't you?

01:14:40.649 --> 01:14:42.918 position:21% line:83% align:start
Just like those toys
from the Scientific

01:14:42.951 --> 01:14:44.554 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ninja Tool Team.

01:14:44.586 --> 01:14:47.422 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then we'll just have
to go with taijutsu.

01:14:47.456 --> 01:14:48.889 position:21% line:89% align:start
A simple deduction.

01:14:56.330 --> 01:14:57.898 position:24% line:89% align:start
Lord Momoshiki...

01:15:37.967 --> 01:15:40.336 position:19% line:89% align:start
Now, Lord Momoshiki.

01:15:41.637 --> 01:15:45.241 position:13% line:83% align:start
It seems the time has come
to consume my chakra.

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:49.210 position:13% line:83% align:start
Just as in the past, when
my guardian entrusted

01:15:49.244 --> 01:15:50.678 position:19% line:89% align:start
me with their power...

01:15:51.679 --> 01:15:53.181 position:30% line:89% align:start
Do not waver.

01:15:55.483 --> 01:15:56.518 position:38% line:89% align:start
I won't!

01:15:57.385 --> 01:15:58.520 position:33% line:89% align:start

01:16:36.587 --> 01:16:37.854 position:35% line:89% align:start
Seriously.

01:16:38.988 --> 01:16:41.690 position:21% line:83% align:start
Come on. Let's teach
him a lesson, Sasuke!

01:16:42.691 --> 01:16:43.725 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

01:18:09.737 --> 01:18:11.337 position:27% line:89% align:start
[attacking roar]

01:19:00.048 --> 01:19:01.416 position:38% line:89% align:start

01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:11.425 position:10% line:83% align:start
Make sure you get the power
of this Scientific Ninja

01:19:11.458 --> 01:19:12.993 position:27% line:89% align:start
Tool on camera!

01:19:13.026 --> 01:19:14.094 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

01:19:14.127 --> 01:19:16.563 position:10% line:83% align:start
Take this! Payback for what
you did to me earlier!

01:19:24.936 --> 01:19:27.673 position:30% line:83% align:start
There they go
again, interfering.

01:19:27.707 --> 01:19:28.940 position:24% line:89% align:start
Those guys again!

01:19:28.973 --> 01:19:32.610 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're fools. But
you have my thanks!

01:20:19.486 --> 01:20:21.855 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, don't worry. I'll
be careful with you.

01:20:21.887 --> 01:20:23.523 position:19% line:89% align:start
I need the fox alive.

01:20:24.524 --> 01:20:26.425 position:30% line:83% align:start
But the others
are nuisances.

01:20:32.731 --> 01:20:33.898 position:27% line:89% align:start
Now's the time!

01:20:34.198 --> 01:20:36.802 position:19% line:83% align:start
Remember what I said!
Release your Rasengan!

01:20:37.535 --> 01:20:39.570 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but do you really
think that I can-?

01:20:39.604 --> 01:20:41.071 position:24% line:89% align:start
Trust your master.

01:20:41.104 --> 01:20:44.141 position:13% line:83% align:start
This is why I brought you
along with me, after all.

01:20:51.515 --> 01:20:52.649 position:30% line:89% align:start
The Rasengan?!

01:20:57.119 --> 01:20:58.487 position:44% line:89% align:start
Go!

01:21:23.844 --> 01:21:24.777 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?!

01:21:25.044 --> 01:21:26.212 position:21% line:89% align:start
What just happened?

01:21:29.114 --> 01:21:30.883 position:10% line:89% align:start
What''s the meaning of this?

01:21:32.919 --> 01:21:34.553 position:19% line:83% align:start
When did you learn the
Rasengan?!

01:21:34.853 --> 01:21:37.087 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do you know how hard
that is to perfect?

01:21:37.823 --> 01:21:38.757 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:41.025 position:21% line:83% align:start
His Rasengan adds a
sudden Change in Chakra

01:21:41.058 --> 01:21:42.928 position:10% line:89% align:start
Nature and then disappears.

01:21:48.097 --> 01:21:49.867 position:27% line:89% align:start
[chuckle] I see.

01:21:50.734 --> 01:21:51.968 position:21% line:89% align:start
Boruto, do it again.

01:21:52.268 --> 01:21:54.737 position:30% line:83% align:start
What, really?
But my Rasengan...

01:21:54.771 --> 01:21:57.540 position:24% line:83% align:start
Do as Sasuke says.
He's your Sensei.

01:21:57.841 --> 01:21:59.709 position:38% line:89% align:start
Um okay!

01:22:01.176 --> 01:22:03.846 position:27% line:83% align:start

I don't feel like
losing today!

01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:19.213 position:16% line:83% align:start
Pathetic. I can make an
endless number of those!

01:23:22.048 --> 01:23:24.652 position:24% line:83% align:start
We've only got one
chance. You understand?

01:23:24.685 --> 01:23:25.920 position:35% line:89% align:start
Let's go!

01:23:25.953 --> 01:23:26.954 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right!

01:23:41.033 --> 01:23:42.834 position:30% line:83% align:start
You never even
had a chance!

01:23:46.804 --> 01:23:48.673 position:10% line:89% align:start
The rest is up to you now...

01:23:54.979 --> 01:23:56.112 position:35% line:89% align:start

01:24:08.924 --> 01:24:10.359 position:35% line:89% align:start

01:25:08.511 --> 01:25:10.847 position:16% line:89% align:start

actually fought alongside
the Five Kage and

01:27:41.114 --> 01:27:44.017 position:10% line:83% align:start

Make sure you do it right
this time, you two, okay?

01:28:36.230 --> 01:28:38.999 position:19% line:83% align:start
After all, you're the
Seventh Hokage's son and the

01:28:39.033 --> 01:28:41.035 position:24% line:89% align:start
Fourth's grandson.

01:28:41.068 --> 01:28:42.269 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Boruto.

01:28:42.303 --> 01:28:43.603 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:28:43.636 --> 01:28:46.239 position:33% line:83% align:start
You wanna be
Hokage, don't you?

01:28:48.208 --> 01:28:50.509 position:19% line:89% align:start
Do I wanna be Hokage?

01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:53.178 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

01:28:53.212 --> 01:28:54.479 position:30% line:89% align:start
No, thank you!

01:28:55.681 --> 01:28:58.250 position:10% line:83% align:start
Although tell you what: when
you become the Hokage, I'll

01:28:58.283 --> 01:28:59.684 position:16% line:89% align:start
be your right-hand man.

01:28:59.717 --> 01:29:02.254 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll make sure to
guard you really well.

01:29:02.287 --> 01:29:03.621 position:33% line:89% align:start
[chuckling]

01:29:03.654 --> 01:29:06.556 position:21% line:83% align:start
To me, being Hokage
is only one path.

01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:09.160 position:13% line:83% align:start
Just 'cause my grandpa and
dad were Hokage, that

01:29:09.193 --> 01:29:12.062 position:21% line:83% align:start
doesn't mean I have
to walk the same one.

01:29:12.596 --> 01:29:14.297 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sarada...

01:29:14.331 --> 01:29:17.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
What I really want is
to become a shinobi

01:29:17.133 --> 01:29:18.500 position:30% line:89% align:start
like your dad.

01:29:22.605 --> 01:29:24.439 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna follow
my own Ninja Way!

01:29:35.116 --> 01:29:37.618 position:35% line:89% align:start
[roaring]

01:29:39.153 --> 01:29:41.488 position:13% line:89% align:start
All right, here it comes.

01:29:41.521 --> 01:29:43.957 position:27% line:83% align:start
Boruto, Mitsuki,
let's do this!

01:29:43.991 --> 01:29:45.658 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Okay!
-Right!

01:34:28.812 --> 01:34:29.812 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, I told you-!

01:34:29.845 --> 01:34:30.846 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's a bear!

01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:31.881 position:30% line:83% align:start
Ugh! Shut up!
It's a panda!

01:34:31.914 --> 01:34:35.251 position:13% line:83% align:start
[chuckle] You two respect
each other so much!

01:34:35.284 --> 01:34:36.552 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:34:36.585 --> 01:34:38.854 position:13% line:83% align:start
It would be really nice if
you could show my parent

01:34:38.888 --> 01:34:40.755 position:19% line:89% align:start
some respect, too...

01:34:40.788 --> 01:34:42.790 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, yeah, speaking of
which, I meant to ask

01:34:42.824 --> 01:34:45.393 position:19% line:89% align:start
you just who is that?

01:34:45.426 --> 01:34:47.862 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, didn't I tell you?

01:34:50.664 --> 01:34:52.766 position:16% line:89% align:start
His name is Orochimaru!

01:34:52.799 --> 01:34:53.767 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?!

01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:54.902 position:33% line:89% align:start
Who's that?

01:34:54.935 --> 01:34:56.370 position:33% line:89% align:start
You mean...

01:34:56.403 --> 01:34:58.871 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're the child of
that Orochimaru?

01:35:02.909 --> 01:35:07.380 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, uh is he, like your
dad or your mom, then?

01:35:07.413 --> 01:35:10.782 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, that doesn't
really matter, does it?

01:35:10.815 --> 01:35:13.385 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hold up, who's this
Orochimaru?

01:35:13.418 --> 01:35:15.287 position:30% line:83% align:start
And how can it
not matter?!

01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:16.720 position:21% line:89% align:start
I don't understand!
