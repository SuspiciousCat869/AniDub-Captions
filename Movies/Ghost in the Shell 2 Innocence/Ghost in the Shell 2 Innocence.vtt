What's the situation?

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.710
Fifty-two minutes ago,

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.420
the suspect killed
its owner at his condo--

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.500
the first crime scene.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.040
The perp fled
and is now holed up

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.420
in the second crime scene--

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.210
an unmarked alleyway
where its killed two officers.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.580
All exits are blocked off.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.590
We plan to go in in two minutes.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.050
U-Uh...

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.800
Trust me, just let him go.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.880
That cyborg guy's
from Section 9.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.880
When they cross your path,

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.540
you're in for a
world of trouble.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.170
Sounds like the cyber police
are itchin' to step in.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.290
They're requesting
a data link right now.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.840
Public Security and now them?

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.130
Politely ask them
to take a hike.

[FORENSICS CHIEF] There have
already been eight homicides

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.710
committed by gynoids this week.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.540
In each case, their cyberbrains
were reinitialized.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.420
And they self-terminated
after murdering their owners.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.000
Of the said units,
this type, 2052 HADALY,

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.410
were made by the
LOCUS SOLUS company.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.540
They're preliminary betas
of a mass production model.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.710
Apparently, they were
provided free of charge

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.920
to company-contracted
evaluators.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.290
But each unit
has now been recalled.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.670
According to the latest report

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.250
they submitted to the
authorities,

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.620
no bugs were detected in either
their hardware or software...

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.540
You got all that, I hope.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.380
A new brand of gynoids
went berserk

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.920
for reasons that no one knows
and snuffed their owners.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.330
The manufacturer got scared
and recalled them.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.130
Now the lawsuits begin,
next the lengthy civil trials,

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.750
then blame is laid
on the producer,

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.790
followed by massive payouts.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.260
Yeah, I got the gist of it

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.710
except for why Section 9
was called in.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.620
[ARAMAKI]
You understand, do you?

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:02.170
More often than not,

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.380
what we call "understanding"
is based upon wishful thinking.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.790
There are two reasons for
our involvement at this time.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.210
The first is that no lawsuits

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.540
are going to be filed
by the next of kin.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.800
Any potential suits against
the manufacturer, LOCUS SOLUS,

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.550
have been settled out of court.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.340
Second, there was a politician

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.590
among the group of victims
who were killed,

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:25.300
as well as a Public Security
official who'd recently retired.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.760
It's possible that this
was a terrorist act.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.460
Therefore, it falls
under our purview

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.080
to determine whether we ought
to head up this case.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:35.550
Ishikawa and Azuma, you run down
leads on the victims.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.800
And I want you two to check out
the gynoids in question.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.880
Uh... But--

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.960
[ARAMAKI]
No questions. Get going.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.210
Let's be clear: I didn't ask
to be your partner.

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:01.840
I'm... the first to admit that

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.710
I might not measure up
to the Major.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.370
No, that isn't it.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.250
I hear that she's still
reported as missing.

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:16.670
[BATOU]
The only things she really owned

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.580
were her brain and her Ghost.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:20.710
Of course, she herself
wasn't too sure

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.580
that she had even those.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.160
The Major's prosthetic
body and cyberbrain

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.790
were government-issued
equipment.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.170
And the memories
inside that brain

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.330
were the government's property,
being intel and all.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.880
But the only thing
the top brass is

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.920
determined to recover
is those memories.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.290
It's of no consequence to them
whether she's alive or dead.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.340
Well, how do you
wanna start on this?

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.210

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.250

of here with it, do you?

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.790

whether we need to do that.

Do I have to show you the way?

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:51.050
No, thanks. We didn't come
all the way here for a tour.

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:52.670
You know, there's
an old saying that goes:

"Not even crows will peck at
a persimmon that's still green."

on the bastards

to start circling overhead
when it's ripe.

You know how it is,
back when you were a cop.

a few choice words

at the son of a bitch
who came in outta the blue

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.000
and swiped a case
right out from under you?

And my scary associate here--

Must be the one who filled this
girl with double-aught buck.

Now if you had used .50-caliber

then it would have been
a simple matter to restore her.

Three people were killed. And
two of those were policemen.

Haraway.

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:28.000
Miss Haraway. What do you mean
a robot committed suicide?

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.040
The gynoids give themselves
authorization to attack humans

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.960
by deliberately malfunctioning.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.790
Therefore, as a logical
consequence of this,

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.340
they're also freeing themselves

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.880
from the Third Law
of the Ethics Code.

I think it would
be more accurate

to call it
"self-termination," personally.

between man
and machine, that is.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.210
[TOGUSA]
Is this "suicide" phenomenon

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:58.920
limited to a particular model?

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.080
[HARAWAY] I wish I could
say it is, but no.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.420
These past few years,
we've been seeing a spike

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.630
in robot-related incidents.

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:08.420

--[TOGUSA] What?
--[HARAWAY scoffs]

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.300
If you ask me, I think
it's because humans

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:27.710
discard their robots.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:29.500
You know, when they
no longer want them?

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:30.830
When the new models come out,

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.750
people buy the latest
and greatest.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.460
Some of those that are tossed
out, end up on the streets

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:39.210
where they gradually deteriorate
from lack of maintenance.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:42.380
[HARAWAY]
All the robots want is

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.380
for us to stop treating
them as disposable.

[HARAWAY]
Humans and robots are different.

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:52.800
But that sort of faith
is nothing more than

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.260
the recognition that
humans aren't robots,

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:59.120
which is on the same level as
saying that white is not black.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.380
[HARAWAY]
Unlike robots intended for

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.630
heavy labor and industrial use,

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:09.840
pet androids and gynoids
weren't designed

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.960
with utilitarianism and
pragmatism in mind.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.960
[HARAWAY] Why did we feel
compelled to create them

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.960
in man's image?
An idealized image, at that.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.800
[HARAWAY] For what reason
or purpose does humanity

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:27.550
go to such lengths to engender
these likenesses of itself?

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:43.870

I do--a girl.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:49.090
[HARAWAY] Children have always
deviated from the human norm.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.800
That is, if we
define a "human" as

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.670
something that has
a fixed identity

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.170
and behaves in accordance
with its own free will.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:56.630
What then, are children,

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:59.920
those early-stage humans who
exist in a state of chaos?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.920
Even though they physically
resemble humans,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.880
they differ from
them drastically--

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.750
mentally and emotionally.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:07.410
The dolls that
little girls play with

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.500
when they pretend to be "Mommy"
aren't merely surrogate babies

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.660
or toys on which to
practice mothering skills.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:16.880
Maybe these girls aren't
just rehearsing for motherhood.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.880
Perhaps playing with dolls
is very nearly

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.960
the same thing as
actually raising children.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.370
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:25.380
[HARAWAY]
In other words,

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.290
raising a child is
the quickest way

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.840
and as close as you can get to
realizing an age-old dream:

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.340
Creating an artificial
human being.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.800
That's how I see it.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.420
Children aren't...
They aren't dolls!

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.880
Do you know Descartes?

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:40.960
He didn't distinguish between

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.500
man and machine,
organic and inorganic.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.750
He owned a doll that resembled

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.250
his daughter, Francine,
who died at age five.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.660
He gave it her name
and he adored it.

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.830
Hmm. I almost forgot about that.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.040
[TOGUSA]
Look, can we get back to

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:58.050
the real-world matter at hand?

00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:59.630
We need some info.

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:01.130
I'd like to hear
your expert opinion

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:05.000
on that LOCUS SOLUS robot,
type 2052 HADALY.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:09.300
Well, let's see.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.880
It's a fine piece of work.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.460
I'm told it's a beta-model
mass-production unit,

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.620
but it's built to unusual specs.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:17.210
Unusual specs?

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:20.040
It's equipped with organs that
aren't needed on a maid-type.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.460
Meaning...

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.500
[HARAWAY]
It's a sexroid.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.080
It's not a hobby you
can brag about in public,

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.630
but it's not illegal.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:35.840
I get it now. No wonder the next
of kin dropped the lawsuits.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.300
As their cyberbrains start to
shut down, they reinitialize.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.800
It's been a standard practice
to have a built-in safeguard

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.800
for the control software's
technical data.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:45.760
However...

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:47.330
[TOGUSA]
Hmm? What is it?

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.340
[HARAWAY] There was a file
left in the audio buffer;

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.800
I'll play it.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:55.130

[HARAWAY]
Huh...

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:23.750
[BATOU]
Thanks for all your help.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:24.960
[TOGUSA]
Hmm?

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.540
Hey!

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.920
Um, excuse me, but may
I ask you a personal question?

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:37.260
No, I've never given birth
nor have I raised any children.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:41.330
And I'm not registered as a
donor at the egg bank, either.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.250
Thank you for your time, Miss...

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:47.160
Just "Haraway."
No Ms., Mrs., or Miss.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.550
[TOGUSA]
Well, she certainly wasn't

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:02.300
your typical engineer, was she?

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:05.130
[BATOU] Probably fills out the
"comments" sections on forms.

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:06.460
I used to do that.

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:07.870
[TOGUSA] That's why you
weren't promoted quicker.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.880
[BATOU] Anyway, I guess we
should keep the cyberbrain

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.040
of that gynoid at
the Section 9 lab.

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:13.130
[TOGUSA]
So, you're telling me

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:14.420
we're not gonna see
that lady again?

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.000
[BATOU] She the type
you like to hang out with?

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.290
[TOGUSA] Yeah, I've got a thing
for weird older women. What now?

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.630
[BATOU]
We'll do this by the book.

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:22.040
[TOGUSA]

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:23.550

a boathouse in Sector 201.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:28.880
Victim is a shipping inspector
at LOCUS SOLUS.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.750
Area secured, police on-scene.

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:32.830
[TOGUSA]
907, roger.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.300
Whoa, what a coincidence.

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.710
[BATOU]
"On ev'ry spring day,

You here alone? What's up?

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.960
Koga went back to base
with the stiff after

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.960
getting reacquainted with the
tuna sandwich he ate for dinner.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.670
[BATOU]
That guy's pathetic.

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:08.580
[ISHIKAWA] The crime scene
as of 22 minutes ago.

You made a rookie

[ISHIKAWA]
Hey, it's a learning experience.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.790
Okay, here's a rundown
of the situation.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.800
Match run on the
victim's cyberbrain.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.010
Jacques Vaucanson,
Chief Shipping Inspector

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.500
for LOCUS SOLUS. Age 54.

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.080
Submitted vacation

then dropped off the radar.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.460
Three days ago,

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.920
victim signed a one-week rental
agreement for this houseboat.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.830
Murder weapons were
kitchen implements

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.250
that came with the boat.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.160
Search run on vehicles
in the area.

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:47.080
Record located of

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:51.040
[ISHIKAWA] Check for yakuza
affiliation in progress.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.460
[ISHIKAWA] Seven cards of

believed to belong
to the victim.

We've got ourselves a

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:29.590
[ISHIKAWA] Looks like he
didn't have time to use it.

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:31.830
[TOGUSA] That might not
have done him any good

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.960
if he came up against a cyborg
that was illegally amped up...

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.420
...or a pro pretending
to be a psycho.

[ISHIKAWA] A personal

a few parts,

teamed up with Togusa.

Well, it's better than some
rookie fresh out of the academy

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.550
who's more of a pain
than a partner.

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:09.670
Well, he's competent enough

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:11.670
considering he was
a former detective.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:12.540
I'm fine with it.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:13.710
Well, I sure hope so because

ever partnered with

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:04.290
then leisurely dismantled him?

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:06.090
[FORENSICS CHIEF] Yeah, that's
what it boils down to.

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:08.130
We confirmed that the organs
found in the refrigerator

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:09.540
belonged to the victim.

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:11.960
They showed early signs of
gastritis and cirrhosis

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.670
of the liver. Looks like
he had a drinking problem.

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:17.290
[ISHIKAWA] Why did he gut
the guy so meticulously?

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.840
[KOGA] Maybe to make us think
he's mentally unstable

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.170
or a sicko?

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:23.960
Or reinforce a message of
revenge or punishment.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.210
[ISHIKAWA]
Which would nix the whole

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:27.960
pro hit disguised
as a thrill kill theory.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.250
What was with
the mangled doorknob?

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:31.660
[FORENSICS CHIEF] Analysis
determined

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:35.170
that the perp's prosthetic limb
was a Chinese-made NR26.

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:36.540
[ISHIKAWA]
A Crab Claw, huh?

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:38.880
[AZUMA]
That's military-issue, isn't it?

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.460
[KOGA] They're available
on the black market,

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:41.870
but lot of 'em are defective.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.090
[FORENSICS CHIEF]
It matched the lacerations

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:44.750
on the victim's head.

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:46.370
[ISHIKAWA] What about
the owner of that car,

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:47.960
the one with rap sheet?

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.250
[KOGA] It seems there a lot
of illegal modifications,

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:51.330
so tracking it down wasn't--

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:53.050
[ISHIKAWA]
Just report your findings.

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:54.960
[KOGA] According to my
follow-up investigation

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.250
on the records of the
neighboring parking lot,

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:59.330
the car belonged
to the Kojinkai,

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.500
a violent criminal organization.

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:02.830
It was bulletproofed,

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.090
and the chassis and
rear shocks were beefed up.

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:07.460
It's been spotted at
multiple violent crime scenes.

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.620
[AZUMA] Tricked-out wheels
for a tricked-out cyborg.

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:12.250
[ISHIKAWA] For hired muscle
with illegally amped output.

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:13.830
Could this be yakuza payback?

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.670
So a motive. What do we
have on the Kojinkai?

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.830
[AZUMA] Japanese crime mob.
They go way back.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:21.000
Drugs, prostitution,
human trafficking,

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.410
real estate, extortion.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.130
They've got a finger
in every pie.

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:25.750
Their boss, a guy named Inoue,

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:27.750
got his head ripped off
by a HADALY.

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:30.660
His deputy, Wakabayashi,
is running things now.

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:31.670
[KOGA]
It's obvious!

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:32.670
[AZUMA]
Avenging the previous boss

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:34.880
is a prerequisite
for taking over.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.670
There's one problem with that.

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:39.500
If the victim knew there was
every likelihood of retaliation,

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:40.870
then why choose
a place to lie low

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.920
that's inside
Kojinkai territory?

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.630
[AZUMA] His cyberbrain
data's been wiped,

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:47.500
so I guess we'll have
to check out his associates.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:50.790
[ISHIKAWA] This is clearly a job
for the local cops, not us.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.630
You're positive it's
not a terrorist act

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:54.460
disguised as a rogue robot?

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:56.670
[ISHIKAWA] So far, we haven't
found any political factors

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:58.210
that link all the victims.

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:00.540
It's looking pretty unlikely.

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:02.300
[ARAMAKI] Batou and Togusa
will work full-time

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.300
investigating these
HADALY runaways,

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.010
including this incident.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.370
The rest of you,
return to your regular shifts.

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:09.590
Dismissed.

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:13.800
[ARAMAKI]
Togusa.

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:18.630
Before you leave here, see me.

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:28.670
[ARAMAKI]
Your thoughts?

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:31.250
Uh... I assume we need to
see if there's a connection

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:33.500
between the Kojinkai
and LOCUS SOLUS.

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:36.120
[ARAMAKI]
I was talking about Batou.

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:37.960
It's imperative
that partners monitor

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:40.920
each other's mental states
with regularity.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.750
Even so, I'm not a cyborg,

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:44.790
and I'm certainly
no cyber-physician.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:48.550
Well, "to understand Caesar,
one not need be Caesar."

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:50.960
You have a family, as I recall.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.540
Do you consider yourself
a happy man?

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:55.510
I guess. Sure.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:58.120
A man once said that people
are never as happy or unhappy

00:32:58.210 --> 00:32:59.460
as they might think.

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:00.830
That what's truly important is

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:04.210
to never grow weary of
your life and aspirations.

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:06.500
What are you getting at?

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:09.210
When I look at Batou lately,
I'm reminded of the Major

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:11.870
and the way she was
just before she vanished.

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:17.120
"Let a man walk alone,
let him commit no sin,

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:21.250
let him have few wishes,
like an elephant in the forest."

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:36.130
So Chief, what made you choose
me for this assignment?

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:37.500
[ARAMAKI]
The Major, she's the one

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.830
who scouted you
from the police force.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.870
[BATOU]
So what did he have to say?

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.750
Pearls of wisdom,
a bit of poetry,

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:52.080
and I don't have to be
Caesar to understand him.

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:53.590
That goes without saying

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:55.670
'cause it's impossible for
the world to live up to

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:58.630
standards set by
the giants of history.

00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:59.750
[TOGUSA gasps]

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:08.040
You planning to start
a war or something?

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:10.300
[BATOU] One need not be
a yakuza when one goes to

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:13.300
a yakuza office, but you
do need to pack some heat.

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:14.630
[TOGUSA]
Look, before we head out,

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:16.040
I wanna make sure of something.

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:17.130
Yeah, what?

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:19.170
We're just going there
to talk, right?

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:20.670
You hate the yakuza, right?

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:21.750
Can't stand 'em.

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:23.250
Same here.

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:24.790
So we're just going to talk.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:27.260
I said, when you go
to a yakuza office--

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:29.460
Yeah, you don't have
to be a yakuza.

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:31.500
But you also said
that you needed weapons.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:32.960
I have a family to think of.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.830
I'll go by myself if you want.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.000
No, I'm going.
That's what partners do.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.910
I want you to give me
your word though.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.210
We're just gonna talk.

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:42.330
I'll avoid shooting as
much as possible.

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:43.340
You happy now?

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:44.250
Yes, I am.

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:46.080
Then let's go do this, Partner.

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:03.920
Who the hell are you?

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.670
We just wanna talk with
your buddy, Wakabayashi.

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:07.830
Go get him.

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:13.010
[screaming]

[MEN yelling, screaming]

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:22.830
You said you would
avoid shooting...

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:26.420
I did avoid shooting...
as much as possible.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:27.790
Now move, Point Man.

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:29.010
There's more coming.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.870
[MEN yelling]

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:54.580

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:55.590
That son of a bitch!

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:56.920
He hacked our eyes!

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:08.590
You can blame those
cheap-ass cyberbrains of yours.

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:12.880
[groaning]

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:26.750
What is it?

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:28.960
That stairwell's
dark and narrow.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:29.920
Now what?

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.080
Now we go up.

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:32.500
Come on, I'll go first.

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.120
No, I will.

00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:36.040
You're too big for me
to see or shoot past,

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:37.510
so I can't cover you.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:48.460
[gasps]

00:36:57.790 --> 00:36:58.960
Huh...?

[groans]

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:14.130
[BATOU] I set off those
little welcome gifts

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:16.210
you dropped on our heads.

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:18.250
Even assuming that
they would've gone off

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:20.460
within the maximum
effective radius,

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:22.170
you'd have to use a lot
more than two of 'em

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:25.290
to take out a cyborg
in body armor.

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:26.670
Why go do that?

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:35.960
You'll tell me about the hit
on the shipping inspector.

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.500
And what your connection is
to LOCUS SOLUS.

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:43.760
[CRAB MAN growling]

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:51.340
[BATOU scoffs]

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:53.090
I was wondering
when you'd show up.

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:02.500
Here, Crab Boy.

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:05.370
You don't look appetizing,
but I'll bite.

[BATOU] Flashy moves like
that never connect.

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:37.500
Idiot.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.210
He knew where the
inspector was and told us!

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:56.920
So we dealt with him.

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:02.960
Look, I just got outta
the joint after three years;

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.000
I dunno shit about what
the old boss was up to

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.330
with the company!

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.170
Still breathing? Partner?

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:11.670
[TOGUSA] The faces of
my wife and daughter

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:14.420
flashed before my
eyes back there.

That wasn't your family's faces
you were looking at.

00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:20.160
It was the Angel of Death.

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:25.050
[ARAMAKI] You were ordered
to conduct an investigation.

00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:26.960
I don't recall telling
you to cut corners

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.000
and take the law
into your own hands.

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.660
And I certainly don't
recall telling you

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:33.420
to launch an assault
on a yakuza office.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.040
We're not in

I'm not pissed off.

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:46.790
But while I don't want
to sound ungrateful

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.460

If something fishy's going on
between LOCUS SOLUS and them,

then they're definitely
gonna bite at the bait.

That's why you did
something so over the top?

If the Old Man was really bent
about what we did,

with the settings
on that right arm.

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.500
Some of these updated

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:37.460
to conflict with

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:39.620
and cause degraded

If that happens,
I'll just get it reset.

Forget that.

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:49.710
The organic components
in the arm you've got

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:53.210
have been matched to your DNA
and are virtually the same.

[ISHIKAWA] Sorry we had to
break into your cozy love nest.

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:16.460
The thought of that

howling for her missing master,

Ah, well. I'm a softie

about the mess she left
on the carpet.

So how long did you have me
under surveillance?

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:34.250
[ISHIKAWA] Don't sweat it.
It's no big deal.

00:44:34.330 --> 00:44:37.210
Yeah, it was! You were
using me a smokescreen!

[ISHIKAWA] Not my fault you're
too green to spot a tail.

Is she a clone?

[BATOU]
From what I understand,

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:49.670
this is the first
type of dog breed

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:52.040
by artificial insemination.

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:53.130
Allowing someone to hack into

00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:55.290
your cyberbrain that way
isn't like you.

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:57.050
When your daily routine
becomes a pattern,

00:44:57.130 --> 00:44:58.800
that's when you walk
into a trap.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.170
I told you to switch over
to the dry food.

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:02.880
But that's her favorite food.

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.000
And besides, that's the
only store in the area

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.500
where I can buy it.

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.580
Well, someone tugged your
strings to make you go berserk.

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:09.960
You started off
the festivities by

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.830
shooting five rounds
into your own arm.

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.550
Then you came within a breath of
blowing away the store owner.

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:16.960
Perhaps you're off your game,
but there aren't many people

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:20.540
who would have the capability
of hacking your cyberbrain.

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:23.170
Other than the Major, that is.

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:24.540
I can't understand
why they didn't make me

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:26.920
blow my head off
right from the start.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.750
Their goal wasn't to eliminate
you; it was to cause a scandal.

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:32.080
Think about it.

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:34.420
You burst into a main yakuza
office, gun blazing,

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:35.830
and sent at least a dozen people

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.880
to the hospital
or the afterlife.

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:40.710
And before the day was out,
you shot up a convenience store.

00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:42.460

that you're either nuts

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.620

a simple accident.

being a Section 9?"

If the Major were here, I'm
betting that's what she'd say.

00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.460
Instructions from the Old Man:

"Continue your work.

evidence in this case,

there can be no official support
from this point forward."

check out LOCUS SOLUS in person.

In its heyday,

00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:32.000
this was the Etorofu

All that's left

is this forest of giant

made it the perfect hangout

for multinationals and
the criminal organizations

There's a quote about how
an object built by an individual

00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:58.130
is as much an expression of
the builder's genetic phenotype

00:47:58.210 --> 00:48:00.040
as the builder himself.

00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:01.510
Yeah, but that guy
was talking about

00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:03.370
beaver dams and spider webs.

It's too bad these are
nowhere near as pretty.

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.750
If life's true nature
is information

00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:14.750
that's passed down via genes,

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:16.410
then society and civilization

00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:19.210
are nothing more than
gigantic memory systems.

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:22.500
That would make cities huge

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:37.290
I really don't know him!

00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:39.960
I mean, I don't know
that particular Kim!

00:54:41.330 --> 00:54:42.870
[TOGUSA]
"When we face death,

00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:45.380
life is like a puppet
on a festival cart.

00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:49.630
As soon as one string is cut,
it crumples and fades."

00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:53.250
[TOGUSA]
Well?

00:55:53.330 --> 00:55:54.540
He started out being assigned as

00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:56.460
a long-range scout
for the military.

00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:59.540
"Having failed in leading,
having failed in following,

00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:02.260
he is fit only to die
by the side of the road."

00:56:02.330 --> 00:56:04.120
His career was shot
to hell for things like

00:56:04.210 --> 00:56:07.000
running black market arms deals
while he was bouncing between

00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:10.500
Special Forces and
cyber warfare units.

00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:14.910
And, in the end, he wound up as
another stereotypical hacker.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.290
One of those "colorful
history" types, huh?

00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:18.840
Have you ever heard
the old adage:

00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:21.630
"If an ass goes a-traveling,
he'll not return as a horse"?

00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:23.540
He is an ass,
just a dumb son of a bitch

00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:25.670
who bit off more
than he could chew.

00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:28.130
You coming?

00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:21.260
[TOGUSA]
Batou. Upstairs in the study.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.670
We got here too late, obviously.

00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:43.630
It looks as though he
tried hack into some place

00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:46.000
and got himself fried
by an attack barrier.

00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:47.250
Well, even if the guy was alive,

00:59:47.330 --> 00:59:49.910
I doubt that he would've
been any use to us.

00:59:56.290 --> 00:59:57.920
"In accordance with
the deceased's wishes,

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.290
we decline offers of
live or artificial flowers

or releasing of birds."

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:03.590
Right.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:10.040

01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:12.010
"He did not lie like a corpse."

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.210
Even the great Confucius
offered sage advice that

01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:15.920
one shouldn't play possum.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.750
I haven't got time
for your stupid games.

01:00:17.830 --> 01:00:20.290
Now pull yourself
together and let's talk.

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:28.340
[KIM laughs]

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.500
[KIM]
It's been a long time;

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:45.000
not since the Nemuro
landing operation.

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.580
[BATOU]
I'm here on business.

01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:48.670
[KIM]
LOCUS SOLUS, right?

01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:51.460
They got into robot
manufacturing late in the game,

01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:53.620
but once they began
focusing exclusively on

01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:55.710
developing and producing
high-end gynoids,

01:00:55.790 --> 01:00:58.500
their business started
to expand rapidly.

01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:00.910
It's rumored that they're
cozy with politicians,

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.540
high-ranking bureaucrats,
and even organized crime.

01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:08.500
[KIM] They got paranoid about
visits from the authorities,

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:10.500
so they set up their
production line inside

01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:13.910
a multinational factory ship
that's anchored off the coast.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.710
The dolls they make there
are fine pieces of work.

01:01:16.790 --> 01:01:18.500
Very sophisticated.

01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:23.420
Sophisticated enough to commit
murder and then kill themselves?

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:26.250
[KIM] If that's true,
it's awfully disturbing.

01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:41.920
[KIM] I don't understand it
when people try to mimic humans

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.170
by breathing souls into dolls.

01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:47.540
The definition of
a truly beautiful doll

01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:51.170
is a flesh and blood body
devoid of a soul--

01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:54.500
A corpse standing on tiptoes,

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:57.370
teetering on the
brink of collapse.

01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:58.920
That's the reason
why you decided

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.330
to turn yourself into a...

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:02.090
...cyberized invalid?

01:02:02.170 --> 01:02:03.670
[KIM]
In terms of physical appearance

01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:07.750
and grace of movement--
No. If you compare the two,

01:02:07.830 --> 01:02:09.500
then just in their
very existence,

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:11.790
humans don't hold
a candle to dolls.

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:13.550
The inherent flaws
in man's knowledge

01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:15.880
lead to flaws in man's reality.

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:18.420
That sort of perfection
can only be achieved by

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.880
something that either
possesses no consciousness

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:23.040
or infinite consciousness.

01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:26.880
In other words, it's only
attainable by dolls or gods.

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:30.130
Would you mind if we got down
to the business at hand now?

01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:32.840
[KIM] Actually, there is
one other type of being

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:36.630
that's on the same level
as dolls or gods.

01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:38.500
[BATOU]
Animals.

01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:40.250
[KIM] The skylarks
of Shelly's poem are

01:02:40.330 --> 01:02:43.290
filled with the joy
of the deep subconscious,

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:45.210
something that
creatures like us,

01:02:45.290 --> 01:02:47.170
with our indomitable
sense of self,

01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:49.580
are incapable of experiencing.

01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:51.210
For the descendants
of those who ate

01:02:51.290 --> 01:02:53.460
of the fruit of
the Tree of Knowledge,

01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:55.500
that's a far more difficult
proposition than

01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:58.040
becoming as gods.

01:02:58.130 --> 01:02:59.260
Therefore, you chose
to put yourself

01:02:59.330 --> 01:03:01.580
into the body of a doll
and play dead.

01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:03.210
Is that why you did it?

01:03:03.290 --> 01:03:04.960
[KIM]
In the words of Confucius,

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:09.620
"Not yet understanding life,
how can you understand death?

01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:11.880
Few people know death..."

01:03:25.170 --> 01:03:26.590
[KIM]
"...we only endure it.

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:27.880
Not out of determination,

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.670
but usually from
stupidity and custom;

01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:31.920
and most men only die

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.920
because they know not
how to prevent dying."

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.080
[BATOU]
But to a living doll,

01:03:36.170 --> 01:03:39.590
death is a given,
a fact of life.

01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:41.420
So that was the reasoning behind

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:44.080
Kim's decision to get
a full prosthetic body.

01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:45.420
[TOGUSA]
Well?

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.080
Yeah, his career was shot
to hell for things like

01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:49.250
running black market arms deals.

01:03:49.330 --> 01:03:50.750
All the while,
he was bouncing between

01:03:50.830 --> 01:03:53.330
Special Forces
and cyber warfare units.

01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:56.590
And in the end, he wound up as
another stereotypical hacker.

01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:58.420
One of those
"colorful history" types?

01:03:58.500 --> 01:03:59.960
Have you ever heard

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:03.460
"If an ass goes a-traveling,
he'll not return as a horse"...?

01:06:09.790 --> 01:06:12.540
[KIM/TOGUSA] This is seriously
disturbing, isn't it?

01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:16.170
Trust me, I know how you feel.

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.290
It's the uncertainty
that perhaps

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:27.630
something that appears
to be alive actually isn't.

01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:28.840
On the other hand,

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:30.420
it might be the
uncertainty that perhaps

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:33.830
something that doesn't
appear to be alive actually is.

01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:38.750
[KIM] Do you want to know why
people are so unnerved by dolls?

01:06:38.830 --> 01:06:41.290
It's because the dolls
are modeled after them.

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:45.010
In other words, dolls are
no less than humanity itself.

01:06:46.790 --> 01:06:48.710
That gives rise to fear--

01:06:48.790 --> 01:06:50.330
fear that humans
might be reduced to

01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:52.960
simple mechanisms and materials.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:56.460
In basic terms, it's the fear
that the human phenomenon

01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:59.670
is fundamentally devoid
of meaning and purpose.

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:04.290
Cut the crap and let's
get down to business.

01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:06.420
[KIM/TOGUSA] Even science,
which has long endeavored to

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:08.670
shed light on
the phenomenon of life,

01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:11.790
has played a major role
in fomenting this fear.

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.590
The belief that nature
is quantifiable

01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:15.750
leads to the
hypothetical conclusion

01:07:15.830 --> 01:07:17.580
that humanity can
also be reduced to

01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:20.130
simple mechanical components.

01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:23.210
"The human body is a machine
which winds its own springs.

01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:26.620
It is the living image
of perpetual movement."

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:29.460
[KIM/TOGUSA] The 18th century
"man as machine" theory has been

01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:33.080
resurrected by cyberbrains
and prosthetic body technology.

01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:35.840
Ever since it became possible
to externalize memory

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:37.500
through the use of computers,

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:40.410
man has been aggressively
mechanizing himself.

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:42.380
This is man's quest to
expand the upper limits

01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:45.090
of his abilities as
a living creature.

01:07:45.170 --> 01:07:46.960
It's a manifestation
of the desire

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:49.750
to overcome Darwinian
survival of the fittest

01:07:49.830 --> 01:07:51.870
and to break free of
the evolutionary rat race

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:53.880
through sheer strength of will.

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.210
It's also the desire
to outdo the natural world

01:07:56.290 --> 01:07:58.790
that gave birth
to mankind itself.

01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:01.630
[KIM/TOGUSA]
God envy--

01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:03.420
The conceited fantasy
to be a life form

If we miss that first hint,
it's all over.

01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:09.550
I've already told you once that

01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:12.010
we don't have time
for your damn games, Kim!

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:15.370
[KIM]
When did you figure it out?

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:16.880
The easiest person
in the world to trick

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.790
is the one who thinks
that he's tricking you.

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:21.800
It's no secret that you were
once a cyber warfare specialist,

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:25.010
but coincidentally, I'm a
veteran infowar pro myself.

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:28.120
Besides, there's a guardian
angel over my shoulder.

01:10:28.210 --> 01:10:29.750
Right now, you're gonna
call up the hall data

01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:32.040
from that huge external memory
device of yours.

01:10:32.130 --> 01:10:33.550
And then, we'll
have a look at it.

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.170
[BATOU]
According to Jacob Grimm,

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:43.960
an artificial human
called a golem

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.500
was brought to life by
inscribing the word "aemaeth,"

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:48.250
meaning "truth,"
on its forehead.

01:10:48.330 --> 01:10:50.460
But if you erase
the first two letters, "ae,"

01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:52.370
it becomes "maeth,"
meaning "death,"

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:54.710
and the creature turns
back to lifeless clay.

01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:57.540
[BATOU]
This was an omen warning me that

01:10:57.630 --> 01:11:00.260
there was no truth to
be found here in the mansion.

01:11:00.330 --> 01:11:01.330
[KIM]
Are you telling me that

01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:03.550
someone breached
the barrier I set up?!

01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:05.920
Impossible! No one
could pull that off!

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.130
[BATOU]
Weren't you listening?

01:11:07.210 --> 01:11:10.170
I said I have a guardian angel.

01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:11.580
This game's over, Kim.

01:11:11.670 --> 01:11:14.090
You'll tell us everything
we wanna know.

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:23.210
That was just an ordinary doll.

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:26.340
[BATOU]
You need to learn when to quit!

01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:28.880
You think I'd fall
for a stunt like that?!

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:31.340
[KIM] Batou, can you
say with certainty

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:32.920
that this isn't
just a continuation

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.580
of the reality manufactured
by my virtual signals?

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:40.580
As we speak, my Ghost
is whispering to me.

01:11:40.670 --> 01:11:42.000
[KIM]
Humanity is merely a thread

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.410
from which the dream
of life is woven.

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.630
That is, if our dreams,
intelligence,

01:11:46.710 --> 01:11:49.710
and yes, even our Ghosts,
are rips and distortions

01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:53.540
that arise in the uniform,
timeless matrix...

01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:54.710
No matter how you spin it,

01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:56.460
you and I are both
worthless human beings,

01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:59.120
but the difference is we're not
walking in the same shoes.

01:11:59.210 --> 01:12:00.630
Folks who don't believe
in the Ghost

01:12:00.710 --> 01:12:02.630
will never know madness,
schizophrenia,

01:12:02.710 --> 01:12:05.460
or a million other things
inherent in the human condition.

01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:08.080
But when they choose to live
Ghostless, what's the point?

01:12:08.170 --> 01:12:09.710
They're really not better off.

01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:11.460
What flesh you have left
will never decay;

01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:12.710
it'll keep on functioning

01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:14.920
until you finally get
what's coming to you.

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:18.580
--[electric zap]
--[KIM groans]

01:12:34.210 --> 01:12:36.170
We're back in the
real world now, aren't we?

01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:37.580
Please just tell me we are.

01:12:37.670 --> 01:12:38.800
There's no distinction between

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:41.210
a memory and
your recollection of it.

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:43.460
In each case, any understanding
of its significance

01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:45.000
only comes after the fact.

01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:48.870
Not being able to save the
subjective passage of time...

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:51.710
...that's where the challenge
is, and things get a bit tricky.

01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:53.420
This is just one price
you have to pay

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:54.790
when you have a cyberbrain

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:57.800
and you allow your memories
to be shared externally.

01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:59.340
I wanna ask you something:

01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:01.420
Do you really have a wife and
kid waiting for you at home?

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:03.250
Are you still a bachelor,
sitting alone,

01:13:03.330 --> 01:13:06.370
with only a dog for company in
some dingy apartment somewhere,

01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:07.840
dreaming about
how nice it would be

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:09.460
to have a family of your own?

01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:12.370
Don't you wanna go and
find out the answer to that?

01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:14.210
Why not stop him
if you knew he'd try that?!

01:13:14.290 --> 01:13:16.580
It was the only way I could find
out what his objective was.

01:13:16.670 --> 01:13:19.170
After he set his trap, knowing
that I'd come to him for help,

01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:21.750
he planned to infect us both
with that virtual experience

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:23.370
in order to get rid of us.

01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:25.000
Probably something like that.

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:26.540
When he had me
dancing to his tune

01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:27.880
and I blew off my right arm,

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:31.040
I suspected he had planted
a tap in my cyberbrain.

01:13:31.130 --> 01:13:33.210
As usual, Ishikawa
was right when he said that

01:13:33.290 --> 01:13:35.080
anybody who was capable
of pulling that off

01:13:35.170 --> 01:13:36.550
would hardly stop there.

01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:39.380
LOCUS SOLUS is probably
thinking the very same thing.

01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:41.750
You expected this would
happen from the start?

01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:44.580
The plan was to make him believe
that I'd fallen into his trap.

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:46.380
That was the only way
I could dive into him,

01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:48.590
but Kim's a talented
son of a bitch.

01:13:48.670 --> 01:13:51.340
If I hadn't gotten that sign,
I never would've made it out.

01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:53.710
Now about that "guardian angel"
you mentioned earlier,

01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:55.330
it wasn't...

01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:58.250
She's gone away
for good probably.

01:13:58.330 --> 01:14:02.210
Beyond the rips in the
uniform matrix is her world.

01:14:02.290 --> 01:14:04.870
She's somewhere out
in the boundless Net,

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:07.960
connected to the entire
realm, fused to it.

01:14:09.330 --> 01:14:11.960
So if you're looking to prove
your own existence,

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:14.960
you can find as many ways
as there are Ghosts.

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:17.120
You got a daughter
yourself, remember?

01:14:17.210 --> 01:14:18.840
Back when we were
stationed in the jungle,

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:22.090
even that bastard Kim
must have understood that.

01:14:22.170 --> 01:14:24.670
I've come out of this with
a valuable lesson also.

01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:25.540
What's that?

01:14:25.630 --> 01:14:26.840
That I don't have what it takes,

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:28.880
the right stuff,
to be your partner.

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:30.500
What are you, wimping out on me?

01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:32.250
It's not due to
anything you said.

01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:35.660
However, I do wanna make it back
to my daughter in one piece.

01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:37.330
Well, I'm still gonna make
you earn your paycheck,

01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:38.670
no matter what you decide.

01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:40.170
You're not done yet?

01:14:40.250 --> 01:14:41.790
But the files we pulled
from his cyberbrain

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:44.130
prove that the LOCUS SOLUS'
criminal was--

01:14:44.210 --> 01:14:46.380
All we've got on him is
obstructing an investigation

01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:48.670
and violating the
Cyberbrain Ethics Act.

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:51.710
And besides, our investigation
is strictly off the books.

01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:53.750
If we're gonna prove that there
was criminal liability

01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:56.210
in the killing rampage
those gynoids went on,

01:14:56.290 --> 01:14:58.620
then we gotta come up with
hard evidence, as you know.

01:14:58.710 --> 01:15:00.790
Yeah, perhaps,
but Kim is a dead end.

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:02.130
No, far from it.

01:15:02.210 --> 01:15:03.960
In fact, I put his cyberbrain
into a Ghost pack,

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:06.290
but the thing's still
linked to LOCUS SOLUS.

01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:08.340
We have to finish this and
tie up all the loose ends

01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:10.710
before they say to hell
with appearances.

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:14.170
Ages ago, there was a
terrific expression:

01:15:14.250 --> 01:15:15.630
"When right and
wrong are in doubt,

01:15:15.710 --> 01:15:17.090
beat the drums
and attack."

01:15:17.170 --> 01:15:19.210
Yep, when the
talking goes nowhere,

01:15:19.290 --> 01:15:20.750
then it's time for violence.

01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:22.330
Hey! This is different;

01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:25.670

on some yakuza office!

01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:29.170

Been a long time, Major.

01:23:50.170 --> 01:23:52.880
Or what should I
call you these days?

01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:54.380
[MOTOKO]
To be precise,

01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:56.920
this is only a part of me
that I uploaded via satellite.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.420
The cyberbrain in this gynoid

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.460
simply doesn't have
the capacity.

01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:01.960
The combat control
programs alone

01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:03.920
take up most of its free space.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.380
So this is the best I can do for
speech and facial expression.

01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:10.290
Go straight up this
corridor about 50 meters,

01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:12.710
and there ought to be
an emergency terminal.

01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:13.830
We'll gain access through that

01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:16.300
and take control
of the entire system.

01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:23.960
[MOTOKO chuckles]

01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:26.460
You haven't changed one bit.

01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:28.040
[BATOU]
Get moving, Point Man.

01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:29.800
I got your back.

01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:31.800
Just like the old days.

01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:52.500
[MOTOKO] "There are few
who can hold up a mirror

01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:54.000
and not become evil.

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:57.620
A mirror does not expose evil;
rather, it creates it."

01:24:57.710 --> 01:24:59.670
[BATOU] Look, this ain't the
time to get philosophical.

01:24:59.750 --> 01:25:02.210
I'm running low on ammo here.

01:25:02.290 --> 01:25:04.960
[MOTOKO] "In short, mirrors
ought to be merely glanced at...

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:07.000
...not stared at."

01:25:51.290 --> 01:25:52.540
[BATOU]
Sure you wanna do that?

01:25:52.630 --> 01:25:53.880
[MOTOKO]
I just need to get control of

01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:55.290
the ship's receiver system.

01:25:55.380 --> 01:25:57.800
Jack into the auxiliary
terminal on the floor.

01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:02.550
[MOTOKO]
Until I gain control,

01:26:02.630 --> 01:26:04.760
the physical functions
of this body will cease.

01:26:04.830 --> 01:26:07.870
My only defense will be that
.30 caliber of yours.

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:09.840
[BATOU] My regular brain
can handle the targeting,

01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:11.500
but I'm down to
one spare clip.

01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:13.290
If I have to go hand-to-hand
with those things,

01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:15.710
I can't make any guarantees.

01:26:17.790 --> 01:26:19.120
[MOTOKO]
I'm starting.

01:28:07.170 --> 01:28:10.550
[MOTOKO] I have control. I've
locked out all external access.

01:28:10.630 --> 01:28:13.920
This ship is operating
in full stand-alone mode.

01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:19.920
[BATOU]
Is it moving?

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.040
[MOTOKO]
The ship is leaving

01:28:21.130 --> 01:28:22.840
the extraterritorial
Northern Frontier

01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:24.250
and heading for
a neighboring country

01:28:24.330 --> 01:28:26.160
where the rule of law applies.

01:28:26.250 --> 01:28:27.540
This ship itself
is hard evidence

01:28:27.630 --> 01:28:30.090
of the criminal activity
of LOCUS SOLUS.

01:28:30.170 --> 01:28:31.590
[BATOU]
They'll come after us.

01:28:31.670 --> 01:28:33.750
[MOTOKO] Ships will meet us
before then to escort us in.

01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:35.660
I've already sent out a request.

01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:37.710
Now, care to take a peek
behind the curtain

01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:40.000
to see what magic spell
LOCUS SOLUS cast

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:42.620
to breathe souls
into these dolls?

01:28:42.710 --> 01:28:45.250
[BATOU]
Don't you know already?

01:28:45.330 --> 01:28:48.370
[MOTOKO]
You have your suspicions, too.

01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:49.840
Don't you?

01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:08.130
[BATOU]
There's no noise at all.

01:29:08.210 --> 01:29:10.750
This chamber is
completely EM-shielded?

01:29:25.210 --> 01:29:26.710
[MOTOKO]
Ghost Dubbing...

01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:28.040
The technology was able to

01:29:28.130 --> 01:29:31.090
produce multiple degraded
copies in animal tests,

01:29:31.170 --> 01:29:32.380
but it was banned
when they learned that

01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:35.710
it destroyed the brain
of the original.

01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:38.960
[BATOU] So, they smuggle kids
in using Kojinkai routes,

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:43.620
brainwash them, then dub their
Ghosts into those gynoid bodies.

01:29:43.710 --> 01:29:45.000
This is the dirty little secret

01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:48.410
that makes LOCUS SOLUS'
gynoids so popular.

01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:53.510
[metal creaking]

01:30:07.290 --> 01:30:09.370
[metal creaking]

01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:46.290
[GIRL whimpers]

01:30:51.710 --> 01:30:53.170
You're here to rescue us!

01:30:53.250 --> 01:30:56.250
You did come! Mr. Vaucanson
said you would!

01:30:56.330 --> 01:30:58.710
He was sure that people from
the police would come!

01:30:58.790 --> 01:31:00.330
And that they'd save us!

01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:02.550
I'm a stage 4,
but my friend Sowana,

01:31:02.630 --> 01:31:05.590
she's already been
moved up to stage 5.

01:31:05.670 --> 01:31:07.170
She doesn't answer me anymore

01:31:07.250 --> 01:31:09.630
because she can't
hear me, you know?

01:31:09.710 --> 01:31:11.000
[MOTOKO]
That inspector who was murdered

01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:12.160
tried to help these children

01:31:12.250 --> 01:31:14.460
by tweaking the
gynoids' ethics code.

01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:15.870
When he was found out,

01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:18.500
he was served up to the
yakuza as their boss' killer.

01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:20.250
That's the long and short of it.

01:31:22.290 --> 01:31:24.830
Mr. Vaucanson said that if
the robots did awful things,

01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:26.880
then someone would
figure it out!

01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:28.540
He said someone would help us!

01:31:28.630 --> 01:31:30.380
And you did!

01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:34.460
[BATOU] Didn't it ever occur to
you that there would be victims?

01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:39.750
I'm not talking
about the humans.

01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:41.790
I'm talking about the dolls
that were given souls.

01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:44.920
Didn't you stop to think
what would happen to them?!

01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:50.710
[GIRL whimpers]
But...

01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:52.870
But I...

01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:54.630
But I didn't want to
be turned into a doll!

01:31:54.710 --> 01:31:56.460
That's all I cared about!

01:31:56.540 --> 01:31:59.790
[sobbing]

01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:01.050
[BATOU sighs]

01:32:04.290 --> 01:32:06.170
[MOTOKO] "We are saddened
by a bird's cry,

01:32:06.250 --> 01:32:08.130
but not a fish's blood.

01:32:08.210 --> 01:32:10.380
Blessed are those with voices."

01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:11.840
If those dolls had voices,

01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:14.170
I bet each and every one of
them would have screamed,

01:32:14.250 --> 01:32:16.540
"I don't want to be a human!"

01:32:16.630 --> 01:32:18.550
I need to ask you...

01:32:18.630 --> 01:32:22.130
Are you happy with being
the way you are now, Major?

01:32:22.210 --> 01:32:25.090
[MOTOKO] I haven't looked at
things that way for a long time.

01:32:25.170 --> 01:32:29.550
But at least I can say that
I'm at peace with myself now.

01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:35.090
"Let a man walk alone,
let him commit no sin.

01:32:35.170 --> 01:32:37.050
Let him have few wishes..."

"...like an elephant...
in the forest."

01:32:41.710 --> 01:32:44.290
[MOTOKO]
Batou, don't forget.

01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:47.920
Whenever you access
the Net, I'll be there.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Right by your side.

01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:56.210
[MOTOKO]
I'm leaving.

[GABRIEL barks]

01:33:37.710 --> 01:33:39.210
I think you saw her.

01:33:39.290 --> 01:33:40.670
Did she appear to you
on that ship,

01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:42.380
that guardian angel of yours?

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.250
[TOGUSA]
Tight-lipped as usual, huh?

01:33:45.330 --> 01:33:47.370
Why, afraid I'll
include it in my report?

01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:50.040
I'll swing by and get you
at 0800 tomorrow.

01:33:50.130 --> 01:33:51.420
Not to mention,
I've gotta repay you

01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:53.710
for looking after this monster.

01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:58.040
Are you in a rush?
Why don't you two come in?

01:33:58.130 --> 01:33:59.210
Getting all warm and fuzzy

01:33:59.290 --> 01:34:01.620
with someone else's family
isn't my thing.

01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:04.500
[TOGUSA'S DAUGHTER]
Daddy!

01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:05.830

There's my big girl!

01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:07.050
[TOGUSA'S DAUGHTER]
Did you bring me a souvenir?

01:34:07.130 --> 01:34:07.960
Where's my souvenir?

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:09.580
[TOGUSA]
I didn't forget. Here.

01:34:09.670 --> 01:34:10.840
[TOGUSA'S DAUGHTER]
Yay!
