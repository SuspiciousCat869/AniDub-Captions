1
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,971
Wow!

2
00:00:39,016 --> 00:00:39,820
Amazing!

3
00:00:39,924 --> 00:00:41,074
It's still going!

4
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:43,561
Wow, it took off in no time at all!

5
00:00:43,728 --> 00:00:45,872
Yeah, and look at how high it can go!

6
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:46,485
Huh?

7
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,255
Hey! Here let me see it!

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,061
Wow!

9
00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:50,017
Come on! Let me have it!

10
00:00:50,253 --> 00:00:51,127
Hahaha!

11
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,522
It can fly at 10,000 meters for 30 minutes!

12
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:55,484
How about that?

13
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,885
Well I'm sure it's a world record for a drone but...

14
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,777
Running something at that altitude...

15
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:04,304
How would it even be possible to operate?

16
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:06,408
He's using satellite communication.

17
00:01:07,063 --> 00:01:10,507
That's the way he's controlling it even from so far away.

18
00:01:10,678 --> 00:01:11,285
Hmm.

19
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,109
In order to fly, the unit
relies on the images it receives.

20
00:01:15,134 --> 00:01:18,001
As well as it's latitude and longitude coordinates.

21
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,750
But you've got to operate the direction,
speed, and camera, all at the same time.

22
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:23,792
So it takes some getting used to.

23
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:26,755
But what's the purpose of building a drone like that?

24
00:01:26,845 --> 00:01:28,289
Are you kidding me?

25
00:01:28,523 --> 00:01:31,093
That sort of thing is ever man's dream come true!

26
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:36,030
With this, you can climb to the top of Mt. Everest

27
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,808
without ever having to take a single step, right?

28
00:01:39,044 --> 00:01:41,397
Oho! Ho ho ho ho!

29
00:01:41,482 --> 00:01:43,629
Wow, that laugh isn't creepy at all.

30
00:01:44,053 --> 00:01:47,682
Or, it's an invention that could
become a giant legal headache.

31
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,260
When we return from this commercial break,

32
00:01:50,268 --> 00:01:53,394
We've got the latest news on the upcoming Tokyo Summit.

33
00:01:56,005 --> 00:02:00,282
I'm outside of the international conference hall
where the summit will be taking place next week!

34
00:02:00,465 --> 00:02:05,534
A resort built on a landfill on Tokyo
Bay, the Edge of Ocean, will open next month.

35
00:02:05,724 --> 00:02:08,252
A vast compound of diverse facilities,

36
00:02:08,286 --> 00:02:10,796
it was designed to mimic a coastal community!

37
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,242
Incorporating the use of water as a central focal point!

38
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,223
The Casino is designed in a seashell motif,

39
00:02:17,272 --> 00:02:20,526
and also serves as a light house to keep watch over ships.

40
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:24,156
A full view of the Edge of Ocean can be enjoyed from here!

41
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:27,049
And over at the shopping mall near the Casino Tower,

42
00:02:27,108 --> 00:02:32,357
there is a large waterfall and a peaceful garden
that welcomes residents, employees, and visitors.

43
00:02:32,577 --> 00:02:34,087
Quite a sight to behold!

44
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,359
The other concept is Harmony.

45
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,922
Inside, the conference hall employs the
understated splendor and beauty, of a Japanese Garden.

46
00:02:42,755 --> 00:02:44,067
And on the first floor,

47
00:02:44,268 --> 00:02:48,039
there are several adjoining trendy
and stylish restaurants to choose from.

48
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,682
Two convenient monorails make rounds on the premises.

49
00:02:51,745 --> 00:02:54,768
One on the upper level, and the other suspended below.

50
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:58,590
As you can see, this city smartly
combines the beauty of tradition,

51
00:02:58,687 --> 00:03:00,595
with the technology of the future.

52
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,837
The Edge of Ocean is connected
by two equal length bridges.

53
00:03:05,213 --> 00:03:08,244
The MPD that will be on patrol on the 1st of May,

54
00:03:08,253 --> 00:03:09,752
opening day of the summit,

55
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:15,346
has announced that they will be dispatching a
whopping 22,000 officers to guard the entire city.

56
00:03:15,615 --> 00:03:19,787
Coming up next, we’ve got the latest
updates on the unmanned probe, "Hakucho"!

57
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:54,079
I'm Shinichi Kudo, a highschool detective.

58
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:58,726
I went to an amusement park with my childhood friend Ran.

59
00:04:58,915 --> 00:05:03,618
And while we were there, we witnessed
some men in black making a dangerous deal.

60
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,193
Because I was so absorbed in watching them,

61
00:05:06,408 --> 00:05:09,434
I didn’t notice the man who came at me from behind.

62
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:14,537
He forced me to drink a poison that
knocked me out, and when I woke up...

63
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:22,409
...I discovered that my body had shrunk!

64
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,636
If those guys ever found out that Shinichi
Kudo is still alive, they'd come back.

65
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,840
Which would put everyone I know in terrible danger!

66
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,225
So on Doctor Agasa’s advice, I
kept my real identity a secret.

67
00:05:35,414 --> 00:05:39,816
When Ran asked me who I was, I quickly
made up the name, "Conan Edogawa."

68
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:42,316
I knew if I wanted info on the men in black,

69
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:45,675
the smart thing would be to stay
at her house with her and her dad,

70
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,459
who ran a detective agency.

71
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:51,371
Meet Genta, Mitsuhiko, and Ayumi.

72
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:53,974
After I shrank, they became my friends.

73
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:58,406
And this is Ai Haibara, her real name is Shiho Miyano.

74
00:05:58,596 --> 00:06:01,258
She used to be a member of the Black Organization,

75
00:06:01,283 --> 00:06:03,857
but she wanted out so she tried to kill herself,

76
00:06:03,971 --> 00:06:06,455
taking the exact same poison I was given,

77
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,265
and it shrank her body too.

78
00:06:09,631 --> 00:06:12,883
Here's another dark figure, also
a part of the Black Organization,

79
00:06:13,018 --> 00:06:15,931
code-named "Bourbon," alias Toru Amuro.

80
00:06:16,046 --> 00:06:18,897
His true identity is chief of the Security Police.

81
00:06:19,072 --> 00:06:21,599
He belongs to the secret institute called “Zero”

82
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:23,800
part of the National Public Safety Commission.

83
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:29,751
To camouflage this, he became a student detective
of Kogoro Mori while working at a coffee shop.

84
00:06:29,885 --> 00:06:31,928
He is indeed a man of mystery.

85
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:38,174
My body may have shrunk, but my I.Q. hasn't.

86
00:06:38,262 --> 00:06:40,860
Detective Conan leaves no case unsolved!

87
00:06:40,988 --> 00:06:43,773
There is always only one truth!

88
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:53,698
The unmanned probe, Hakucho, once
done collecting samples from Mars,

89
00:06:53,753 --> 00:06:57,918
will finally be making its return
journey to Earth on May 1st, Japan time.

90
00:06:58,429 --> 00:07:02,214
Upon its return home, the probe
itself will burn up during re-entry,

91
00:07:02,563 --> 00:07:06,098
leaving behind only a capsule 4 short meters in diameter,

92
00:07:06,162 --> 00:07:08,370
to safely re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere.

93
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:15,418
At that point, the capsule will descend by parachute,
and is expected to land in the Pacific Ocean near Japan.

94
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:16,529
That's fascinating!

95
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,412
Here in the sample capsule,

96
00:07:18,566 --> 00:07:22,870
they’ve put a GPS-controlled device
that’s called the precision guided system.

97
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:26,303
allowing the capsule to fall
within a radius of 200 meters.

98
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:26,882
Huh...

99
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,790
Huh?! Wow, woah!

100
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,218
Give it to me!

101
00:07:30,243 --> 00:07:30,970
Come on!

102
00:07:30,995 --> 00:07:31,471
It's my turn!

103
00:07:31,495 --> 00:07:32,180
Let me do it!

104
00:07:32,215 --> 00:07:33,735
You've had it longer!

105
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,642
We gotta take turns!

106
00:07:35,343 --> 00:07:36,368
Woah! Oh!

107
00:07:37,568 --> 00:07:38,188
Hmm...

108
00:07:38,648 --> 00:07:42,304
Maybe I should just divide the remote
control into three parts for them.

109
00:07:42,357 --> 00:07:44,241
Direction, speed, and camera.

110
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,854
Aw man...

111
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,961
We interrupt this broadcast
to bring you some breaking news!

112
00:07:49,223 --> 00:07:53,511
This just in.There’s been a large explosion
at the International Conference Hall...

113
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:55,900
Where the Tokyo Summit is due to be held next week.

114
00:07:55,981 --> 00:07:56,409
Huh?

115
00:07:56,503 --> 00:07:58,729
This is the image security cameras captured.

116
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:06,537
What's going on?

117
00:08:07,436 --> 00:08:11,258
Edge of Ocean, a combined
resort compound, is not yet open.

118
00:08:11,361 --> 00:08:13,190
So luckily there were no civilians present at

119
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:13,838
Hey, Doc!

120
00:08:13,862 --> 00:08:14,825
the facility during the blast.

121
00:08:14,905 --> 00:08:17,397
However, several police officers
who were there in advance to

122
00:08:17,422 --> 00:08:20,555
secure the site for the summit
were either injured or killed.

123
00:08:20,657 --> 00:08:21,675
Again I repeat.

124
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:22,890
If you're just joining us,

125
00:08:22,975 --> 00:08:24,771
It could be a terrorist attack!

126
00:08:25,202 --> 00:08:27,792
Perhaps... But the summit is next week!

127
00:08:28,096 --> 00:08:29,824
Maybe it was an accident?

128
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,603
... the MPD hasn’t disclosed the number of casualties.

129
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,458
The obvious question remains.

130
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,664
Will this be ruled as a criminal
case or an unfortunate accident?

131
00:08:37,803 --> 00:08:41,406
Some Police have been hurt and
killed... That’s quite serious.

132
00:08:41,795 --> 00:08:44,075
Doc! The display just went black!

133
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:45,934
Oh, I'll be right there!

134
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:48,786
Wait a minute... This makes no sense.

135
00:08:48,888 --> 00:08:53,093
If they commit an act of terror prior to
the Summit, then security would get tighter.

136
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,685
Hey, what's wrong?

137
00:08:55,816 --> 00:08:59,782
The security footage... Right after the explosion...

138
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,211
Did you see something weird?

139
00:09:02,914 --> 00:09:06,560
Just for an instant... And I may be wrong about it.

140
00:09:06,786 --> 00:09:07,561
What?

141
00:09:07,876 --> 00:09:08,887
But that man...

142
00:09:09,435 --> 00:09:10,906
He works at Poirot.

143
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,416
I think his name was Toru Amuro.

144
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,240
Wait, that Amuro?!

145
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,435
According to our forensics,

146
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,048
no traces of the explosives were found.

147
00:09:27,476 --> 00:09:31,314
On the first floor of the International
Conference Hall, there is a Japanese restaurant.

148
00:09:31,524 --> 00:09:34,406
The kitchen in its basement is
where the explosion took place.

149
00:09:34,752 --> 00:09:37,807
It was there that they detected a significant gas leak.

150
00:09:38,017 --> 00:09:40,642
It's safe to conclude that this was a gas explosion.

151
00:09:42,804 --> 00:09:46,117
Hold it. That building had recently been completed.

152
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:48,046
A gas explosion's not possible.

153
00:09:48,284 --> 00:09:51,885
Seemingly. However this gas
pipe is the latest model available.

154
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:55,372
The tap can even be controlled
and operated through the internet.

155
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:58,725
Then how the hell could a gas leak even be possible?

156
00:09:58,841 --> 00:10:02,694
It’s may be that the system was already
damaged before it was initially installed.

157
00:10:02,777 --> 00:10:04,689
Weren't there any routine checks?

158
00:10:05,093 --> 00:10:07,303
Actually, there was one scheduled for today.

159
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:09,118
What do you mean, scheduled today?

160
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,026
The Edge of Ocean’s whole internet
network was going to be set up today.

161
00:10:13,252 --> 00:10:17,315
Yes, after the Public Security and
Safety Bureau did their protocol check,

162
00:10:17,464 --> 00:10:19,097
this was next on their list.

163
00:10:19,264 --> 00:10:23,630
Well if that’s true, then the likelihood
that this was an accident is pretty high.

164
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:26,753
Mhm, if this were the work of terrorists,

165
00:10:26,824 --> 00:10:29,835
it would be pointless unless executed on May 1st,

166
00:10:29,953 --> 00:10:32,752
the day when heads of state and V.I.P.’s would be there.

167
00:10:33,157 --> 00:10:36,807
And because of today’s incident,
there’s been a venue change.

168
00:10:36,866 --> 00:10:38,825
The Summit will have a new location.

169
00:10:42,302 --> 00:10:43,693
I have a new report.

170
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:45,844
What is your name and your unit?

171
00:10:45,869 --> 00:10:47,197
I'm Yuya Kazami.

172
00:10:47,432 --> 00:10:51,528
Public Security and Safety Bureau of
MPD. Now, about that gas explosion…

173
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:52,401
Nothing yet.

174
00:10:52,696 --> 00:10:55,348
They’re checking on the electrical facilities right now.

175
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:57,162
In regards to the igniter,

176
00:10:57,781 --> 00:10:59,908
it could’ve been a type of high pressure cable.

177
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,587
I see, could it be faulty construction?

178
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:03,571
No, but...

179
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:09,284
They found fingerprints burnt on the door of the
storeroom where the high pressure cable was being housed.

180
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,110
Which implies they were there before the explosion?

181
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,796
Yes. The only people who entered
the site were the construction workers,

182
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,802
and our security police team who checked it this morning.

183
00:11:20,122 --> 00:11:23,066
And then we ran all of the
fingerprints through our database.

184
00:11:23,091 --> 00:11:27,211
Prints from constuction workers and police
officers who had been on site were also scanned.

185
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:32,655
And we found that the prints matched those of someone
formerly employed at the First Investigation Section.

186
00:11:33,184 --> 00:11:34,459
Kogoro Mori.

187
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:36,434
What?

188
00:11:36,474 --> 00:11:37,445
That's impossible!

189
00:11:37,828 --> 00:11:38,820
Is he joking?

190
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:39,623
Huh...

191
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,023
That's absurd. How could that be?

192
00:11:47,035 --> 00:11:49,617
The International Conference Hall at the landfill?!

193
00:11:49,753 --> 00:11:52,152
But I've never been there! Not even once!

194
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,146
That may be, but they found your fingerprints at the site.

195
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,989
It can't be! Hmph!

196
00:11:58,737 --> 00:12:03,291
Could it be... that you got drunk again, and
then wandered in there without realizing it?

197
00:12:03,577 --> 00:12:05,060
Absolutely not!

198
00:12:05,145 --> 00:12:07,405
I told you I've never been there!

199
00:12:07,915 --> 00:12:11,442
This is all a mitake! They can look
all they want. They won't find anything!

200
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,508
Please settle down.

201
00:12:12,548 --> 00:12:15,850
This is absurd! I'd never do anything of the kind.

202
00:12:17,465 --> 00:12:18,226
Pardon me.

203
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:19,273
Oh, okay...

204
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,163
Conan, is something wrong?

205
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:28,456
That officer there...

206
00:12:28,762 --> 00:12:30,688
His face is injured, is he alright?

207
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:32,604
Oh, you mean Kazami?

208
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,949
He was one of the officers on
site when the explosion happened.

209
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,114
Hmm...

210
00:12:37,138 --> 00:12:37,628
Huh?

211
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,066
Um, I have to go to the restroom!

212
00:12:52,732 --> 00:12:54,050
Hey, what's up?

213
00:12:54,826 --> 00:12:55,377
Y-Yeah?

214
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,500
Huh? Your dad is being suspected by the police?

215
00:13:00,371 --> 00:13:05,272
Mhm... Though I'm certain this
has to be some kind of a mistake.

216
00:13:05,836 --> 00:13:08,597
Alright then, I'll go check it out on my end.

217
00:13:10,034 --> 00:13:12,427
Using an alternate phone is a real pain.

218
00:13:13,665 --> 00:13:15,782
Wait, where did my phone go?

219
00:13:23,588 --> 00:13:24,786
Hey Doc, are you there?

220
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,478
Hmm?

221
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:28,820
Oh, hello Shinichi! What's going on?

222
00:13:29,028 --> 00:13:30,629
I'd like to ask you a favor.

223
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,686
Why is this taking them so long?!

224
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:36,385
Well...

225
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:36,690
You have to calm down sir.

226
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,136
I want them out of here! Now!!

227
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:42,968
Huh?

228
00:13:43,815 --> 00:13:44,492
Hm?

229
00:13:45,395 --> 00:13:46,381
My phone...

230
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,756
Man! This is so much fun!

231
00:13:58,228 --> 00:14:02,017
Wait, Genta slow down a little bit! You're going too fast!

232
00:14:02,112 --> 00:14:03,958
We're trying to take picutres here!

233
00:14:03,997 --> 00:14:05,260
Oh, sorry!

234
00:14:05,467 --> 00:14:07,149
But this thing is so awesome!

235
00:14:07,273 --> 00:14:09,842
I mean, can you believe how far it can fly?!

236
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,767
It's got amazing range. As far as 30 kilometers!

237
00:14:14,013 --> 00:14:17,533
Yeah! We flew it from 20 km away just a little while ago!

238
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:18,319
Did you?

239
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:23,041
We just delivered something to
my aunt, who lives in Saitama!

240
00:14:23,346 --> 00:14:25,458
Your aunt was really happy, wasn’t she?

241
00:14:26,357 --> 00:14:28,489
Oh... You guys did that?

242
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:33,128
But, look! That display is so tiny
you can hardly see what’s in it.

243
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:34,184
Hmm...

244
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:38,392
It wasn’t really designed to be used by
more than one person at a time, you see.

245
00:14:38,781 --> 00:14:42,931
Hey, Doc, would you be able to
put a display on my controller, too?

246
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:45,001
I would like to have one too , please!

247
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:45,855
Hmm...

248
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,567
I suppose I could.

249
00:14:47,685 --> 00:14:50,327
If you can ace this quiz!

250
00:14:50,352 --> 00:14:50,773
Ugh...

251
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:55,667
Now then. If you answer these correctly
I'll put displays on all of your controllers!

252
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,823
What?!

253
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,625
Ready? Here we go!

254
00:15:00,162 --> 00:15:05,672
In the list of all possible existing hiragana,
which one of these has the largest scale of usage?

255
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:07,190
Number 1 "A."

256
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,670
Number 2 "Ka."

257
00:15:08,712 --> 00:15:10,005
Number 3 "Sa."

258
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,345
Number 4 "Ta."

259
00:15:11,602 --> 00:15:13,720
But what does that all mean anyway?

260
00:15:13,806 --> 00:15:17,193
It’s simply as I said, the largest scale of usage!

261
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:20,324
Gosh, that actually sounds kinda complicated…

262
00:15:20,411 --> 00:15:22,023
“A. I. U. E. O.”

263
00:15:22,191 --> 00:15:23,779
“Ka. Ki. Ku. Ke. Ko.”

264
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,716
That should help you figure out the answer.

265
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:27,716
Sa, Shi, Su, Se, So...

266
00:15:27,918 --> 00:15:29,716
Ta, Chi, Tsu, Te, To.

267
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:31,498
Huh... I don't know!

268
00:15:31,523 --> 00:15:34,716
Hey, watch it, Ayumi! Quit moving the camera around!

269
00:15:34,772 --> 00:15:35,903
Oh! I'm sorry!

270
00:15:36,777 --> 00:15:38,461
Okay. Here's hint number one.

271
00:15:38,597 --> 00:15:39,376
"Hakucho."

272
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,461
Hakucho?

273
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,574
Oh! You're getting closer?

274
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:44,854
Hakucho or a Swan...

275
00:15:45,095 --> 00:15:46,903
Brings to mind Swan Lake...

276
00:15:47,118 --> 00:15:50,985
It means big lake, or "Mizuumi"!
Which means the answer is "Mi!"

277
00:15:51,115 --> 00:15:51,890
Wait, what?

278
00:15:52,441 --> 00:15:55,135
Hint number two, "the Hakucho returns."

279
00:15:55,614 --> 00:15:58,154
So are you saying that the Hakucho is going home?

280
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,528
Oh, so it's the lake after all!

281
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:05,056
A home... A home... House..?

282
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:06,479
Oooh!!

283
00:16:06,524 --> 00:16:07,901
Yes, I got it!

284
00:16:08,132 --> 00:16:11,237
The unmanned probe, Hakucho, will come back from space!

285
00:16:11,577 --> 00:16:13,361
Right. So the answer is?

286
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:14,947
The line that starts with "A!"

287
00:16:15,263 --> 00:16:17,690
The hiragana in the middle of this is “U.”

288
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:20,175
In other words it means “Uchuu,” or “space!”

289
00:16:20,749 --> 00:16:23,911
Cause there’s nothing out there
that’s bigger than space, of course!

290
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:25,355
Yes, exactly.

291
00:16:25,404 --> 00:16:26,487
I did it!

292
00:16:26,545 --> 00:16:27,184
Ai...

293
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:30,520
I think you gave those kids too many hints!

294
00:16:30,632 --> 00:16:32,283
We made it too easy for them!

295
00:16:32,563 --> 00:16:33,817
Well you know Doc,

296
00:16:34,063 --> 00:16:37,900
It's pretty dangerous to quiz people
while they're operating a device like a drone.

297
00:16:38,227 --> 00:16:42,618
Besides, the pictures they’re taking with
that thing are serious. Unlike your frivolous quiz.

298
00:16:42,717 --> 00:16:44,057
Yeah, good point...

299
00:16:45,298 --> 00:16:46,431
All three divisions...

300
00:16:46,846 --> 00:16:49,668
Criminal, Public Safety, and Security...

301
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,083
Were scheduled to check the site before the summit.

302
00:16:52,395 --> 00:16:55,888
The public safety division was put in
charge of dealing with the explosion.

303
00:16:56,176 --> 00:16:58,271
That's why Detective Kazami got hurt.

304
00:16:59,055 --> 00:17:02,155
He was outside the building,
so he was only slightly injured,

305
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,641
but the ones who were inside weren’t as lucky.

306
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:05,682
Hm.

307
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:09,116
Yeah some people were killed. I saw it on the news.

308
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:09,768
Yeah...

309
00:17:10,554 --> 00:17:13,007
I guess I’m not supposed to say things like this...

310
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:17,210
But still, the outcome could have been a lot worse.

311
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,618
I mean, at least no civilians were hurt in the blast.

312
00:17:19,895 --> 00:17:22,584
If the explosion happened during the actual summit,

313
00:17:22,804 --> 00:17:25,180
then the whole world would’ve gone out of control.

314
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:30,758
That's right. MPD and especially the
Public Safety Bureau are already being bashed.

315
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,317
I guess it can’t be helped since the
accident took place before the summit.

316
00:17:34,381 --> 00:17:35,321
Accident?

317
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,256
Yes. They were going to rule this an accident,

318
00:17:38,322 --> 00:17:42,066
based on the circumstantial evidence
gathered at the site... At first.

319
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,512
And Pops Kogoro’s fingerprints were
also found at the site,weren’t they?

320
00:17:45,617 --> 00:17:46,186
Right.

321
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,706
And when Mr. Kazami found them,
it suddenly became a criminal case.

322
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,653
Detective Kazami did?

323
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,282
Huh?

324
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,427
Thank you, Officer Takagi!

325
00:17:57,642 --> 00:17:58,277
Bye!

326
00:17:58,335 --> 00:18:01,672
Huh..? Be careful out there and get yourself home!

327
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:03,777
Ran, what's up?

328
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:04,993
I need your help!

329
00:18:05,109 --> 00:18:05,628
Huh?!

330
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:07,733
It's dad. They're going to arrest him!

331
00:18:08,741 --> 00:18:09,473
Damn!

332
00:18:12,484 --> 00:18:14,860
I told you! I don't know about it!

333
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,958
Well, we confiscated you computer and we discovered these.

334
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:20,968
The complete summit schedule.

335
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,959
As well as the blueprints of the
International Conference Hall that was bombed.

336
00:18:25,084 --> 00:18:25,618
Huh?!

337
00:18:26,017 --> 00:18:26,961
No way!

338
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,710
He’d never be able to save documents like
that on his computer! He wouldn't know how!

339
00:18:30,815 --> 00:18:31,901
Yeah, she's right!

340
00:18:32,228 --> 00:18:33,968
He can barely work the thing!

341
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:35,650
I can't work that stuff.

342
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,450
That's great. You can tell us the rest at the station.

343
00:18:38,475 --> 00:18:39,996
You gotta be joking!

344
00:18:40,108 --> 00:18:42,768
I don't take orders from the Public Safety Division!

345
00:18:44,016 --> 00:18:47,441
All right, then I’ll have to arrest
you for interfering with police duty.

346
00:18:47,451 --> 00:18:47,843
Huh?!

347
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:49,320
Wait, I barely touched you!

348
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:50,771
Wait, what are you doing?! Ugh!

349
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:52,705
Hey!

350
00:18:52,729 --> 00:18:53,980
Oh, no... Please, don't!

351
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,664
4:56 pm, April 28th.

352
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:01,091
Hey, stop it! Let me go!!

353
00:19:01,123 --> 00:19:03,800
Resisting will only make your charges worse.

354
00:19:04,015 --> 00:19:04,515
Wait!

355
00:19:04,563 --> 00:19:05,356
I'll have your badges! Ugh!

356
00:19:05,381 --> 00:19:10,733
If Pops Kogoro is the perp, what motive
would he have for bombing the Summit Hall?!

357
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,886
I would never do that!

358
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:16,020
Don't worry. We’ll hear you out during the interrogation.

359
00:19:16,115 --> 00:19:16,894
No... Wait, hey!!

360
00:19:16,918 --> 00:19:18,002
Wait Dad! No!!

361
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,735
Calm yourself, Ran! Call Shinichi now!

362
00:19:20,764 --> 00:19:22,014
I already did!

363
00:19:24,427 --> 00:19:25,701
So where is he...?!

364
00:19:26,486 --> 00:19:28,140
I can't believe he wouldn't show up!

365
00:19:28,161 --> 00:19:31,763
Especially at a time like this!
What kind of person does that?!

366
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:33,983
Let's go.

367
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,066
You can't do this!

368
00:19:57,209 --> 00:19:59,474
Is this guy Public Safety and Security?

369
00:20:00,892 --> 00:20:02,922
Beats me? How should I know?

370
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:04,996
His face is injured.

371
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:07,124
Kind of like yours Mr. Amuro.

372
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,735
Which means you were at the
blast site too. Isn't that correct?

373
00:20:12,164 --> 00:20:14,190
I have no idea what you're talking about.

374
00:20:14,366 --> 00:20:17,039
You were part of the security check beforehand.

375
00:20:17,438 --> 00:20:20,790
And after, you were checking
for possible terrorist activities.

376
00:20:21,197 --> 00:20:25,056
But if you didn't find anything, the
bombing would just be ruled as an accident.

377
00:20:25,351 --> 00:20:27,471
So you figured you’d make a perp up!

378
00:20:27,783 --> 00:20:28,320
Right?!

379
00:20:30,182 --> 00:20:33,120
You’re both police officers,
so you know how a setup works!

380
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:36,109
You’d also know how to illegally upload those files,

381
00:20:36,204 --> 00:20:37,832
and plant evidence at the site!

382
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:41,566
Cops wont listen to you if you
don’t have the proof to back it up.

383
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,769
Why would you do something like this?!

384
00:20:48,204 --> 00:20:49,212
I'll tell you why.

385
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,175
There’s something I’ve gotta protect
even if it means risking my own life.

386
00:20:53,425 --> 00:20:54,969
Uh... Ah!

387
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,844
Maybe this time... Amuro's on the other side.

388
00:21:06,093 --> 00:21:07,079
But why?

389
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,588
Why won't you be dad's lawyer?!

390
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:14,158
Don't tell me that you actually
think that Mr. Mori bombed the place?!

391
00:21:14,446 --> 00:21:16,798
No. He's not capable of such a thing.

392
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,590
Then why won't you help?

393
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:23,865
It’s unethical for attorneys to defend family members.

394
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,059
A judge could definitely see
that as a conflict of interest,

395
00:21:27,115 --> 00:21:29,307
and dismiss the case before it went to trial.

396
00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:32,900
Put it in simpler terms... If I
choose to be his defense lawyer,

397
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:35,743
its more than likely it could work against us.

398
00:21:35,888 --> 00:21:36,751
Oh no...

399
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:41,168
Don't you worry. I'll find us a good lawyer right away.

400
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,760
It's too bad.

401
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:47,326
It turned out just as you said Mr. Furuya.

402
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:49,431
If only we'd known earlier...

403
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:53,207
The members of our Safety and Security
Bureau wouldn’t have had to die...

404
00:21:53,631 --> 00:21:57,933
Yeah, well... I didn't think the place
would get blown up before the summit.

405
00:21:58,449 --> 00:22:02,089
We’re scanning the whole list of known
domestic terrorists as likely suspects,

406
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,591
and of course, the international ones to be thorough.

407
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:07,100
Any new developments on your end?

408
00:22:07,824 --> 00:22:11,304
I’m checking the communications
that accessed the gas tap at the site.

409
00:22:11,725 --> 00:22:14,125
They’re using a rather unorthodox system.

410
00:22:14,581 --> 00:22:15,451
What do you mean?

411
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:20,552
As soon as things get rolling we’ll check in
with the Security Police at MPD from our side.

412
00:22:20,703 --> 00:22:21,663
Very good sir.

413
00:22:22,064 --> 00:22:23,871
And, how's the other case going?

414
00:22:24,153 --> 00:22:28,217
Oh, right. We're going to be sending in operative "2291."

415
00:22:30,531 --> 00:22:30,929
Huh...

416
00:22:31,735 --> 00:22:32,389
You still there?

417
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:34,486
Yeah... Got it.

418
00:22:41,956 --> 00:22:43,576
Can you believe this?

419
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,656
Is it true..?

420
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,356
Hmm...

421
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:47,728
So in other words...

422
00:22:48,407 --> 00:22:51,068
They found incriminating evidence on his computer.

423
00:22:51,093 --> 00:22:55,103
A digital trail indicating he had
access to the gas line at the site?

424
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:58,361
Yes... That was the official report.

425
00:22:58,607 --> 00:23:00,379
Straight from the Cyber Crime Division.

426
00:23:00,693 --> 00:23:01,516
So that's it.

427
00:23:01,793 --> 00:23:04,478
Kogoro Mori snuck in here, opened this door,

428
00:23:04,795 --> 00:23:07,451
and rigged the high pressure cable to blow when triggered.

429
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,078
That's impossible!

430
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:12,982
If that’s the case, then he would’ve
been detected by one of the security cameras.

431
00:23:13,007 --> 00:23:13,867
Not necessarily.

432
00:23:13,891 --> 00:23:14,370
Huh?

433
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:17,738
The internet’s only been up and
running there since yesterday...

434
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:19,485
No...

435
00:23:20,117 --> 00:23:22,094
What's he saying in his interrogation?

436
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:27,164
He's still denying any involvement in the incident,
but we don’t require a confession to prosecute him.

437
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,173
You mean you'd go forward with
this without even a motive?!

438
00:23:30,345 --> 00:23:32,517
With enough proof, we can prosecute.

439
00:23:33,392 --> 00:23:35,974
We're police officers, it's all part of procedure.

440
00:23:36,368 --> 00:23:38,928
Hold on now! Something's not right here!

441
00:23:38,995 --> 00:23:40,168
Something's not right!

442
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:43,259
Something's not right here, is simply not enough!

443
00:23:43,408 --> 00:23:46,555
Do you think this investigation
will deepen because you have a hunch?

444
00:23:48,818 --> 00:23:50,060
That's too bad...

445
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:51,808
I see.

446
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,923
Oh, come on!

447
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,140
Why won't anybody take Dad's case?!

448
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:00,483
Is it too risky?

449
00:24:00,811 --> 00:24:02,579
Probably, that and...

450
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:07,180
I’m guessing they don’t want to get involved
because it would also be too high profile.

451
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:11,018
Given that the defendant is the famous Sleeping Kogoro...

452
00:24:12,486 --> 00:24:13,306
Come in.

453
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:14,887
Hello.

454
00:24:15,383 --> 00:24:16,760
Inspector Shiratori.

455
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:21,230
I wanted to give you the heads up on
something before they broadcast it on the news.

456
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,270
What is it?

457
00:24:22,871 --> 00:24:26,685
It's Mr. Mori... They're going to prosecute.

458
00:24:28,186 --> 00:24:30,736
Do they have enough evidence to prosecute him?

459
00:24:30,822 --> 00:24:32,943
His fingerprints were found at the crime scene.

460
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:35,582
On his computer, they found site blueprints,

461
00:24:35,703 --> 00:24:40,183
the summit schedule, and the access
log to all of the incendiary objects.

462
00:24:40,828 --> 00:24:43,457
... That is quite a bit of incriminating evidence.

463
00:24:43,544 --> 00:24:46,578
But why? Why would Dad even...

464
00:24:52,523 --> 00:24:53,095
Mom...

465
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:55,597
Just wait, Ran.

466
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,720
I give you my word that I'll
save Pops. No matter what it takes!

467
00:25:02,108 --> 00:25:02,660
Doc!

468
00:25:03,295 --> 00:25:04,391
You said you found it?!

469
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,147
Oh good, you're here.

470
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:07,594
Look.

471
00:25:10,245 --> 00:25:11,153
Looks real.

472
00:25:11,486 --> 00:25:13,440
Yeah, it could pass for a bomb.

473
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:17,834
I took some screenshots of the debris
from the bombing, like you asked me to.

474
00:25:18,545 --> 00:25:23,006
I fit all the pieces together like a puzzle,
until I had a complete composite picture.

475
00:25:24,548 --> 00:25:27,471
So now in order to specify the type of bomb,

476
00:25:27,798 --> 00:25:32,167
Ai is trying to match it with all kinds
of images found here, on the internet.

477
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:34,541
Okay.

478
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,688
Finally, I found a match.

479
00:25:37,879 --> 00:25:38,307
Hm?

480
00:25:38,423 --> 00:25:39,180
What is it?

481
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,797
Here come the details.

482
00:25:45,985 --> 00:25:48,002
It’s an IoT pressure cooker?

483
00:25:48,264 --> 00:25:51,490
Yeah, maybe modified somewhat
from a standard pressure cooker.

484
00:25:51,863 --> 00:25:56,527
By setting the temperature and cooking time, you
can make everything from stews, to roasts, to soup...

485
00:25:56,673 --> 00:25:58,758
All from your smartphone, it says.

486
00:25:58,837 --> 00:25:59,660
Cookware?

487
00:25:59,773 --> 00:26:01,210
Besides the pressure cooker,

488
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:04,233
other items like frying pans, sauce pots,

489
00:26:04,392 --> 00:26:06,710
and even dishes, were scattered everywhere.

490
00:26:07,056 --> 00:26:11,712
Based on those facts, the explosion was
probably in one of the restaurant’s kitchens.

491
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,422
Are you kidding?!

492
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:13,854
Hm?

493
00:26:14,254 --> 00:26:16,205
It wasn't even a bomb to begin with!

494
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:16,840
Hey!

495
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:21,069
You asked her to help figure out what kind
of bomb caused this, and that’s what she did.

496
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,850
So you shouldn’t be talking to
her with that kind of attitude.

497
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,462
This behavior is very unlike you.

498
00:26:28,676 --> 00:26:29,975
I'm sorry, Ai...

499
00:26:30,484 --> 00:26:32,960
What’s wrong? Something happen?

500
00:26:33,713 --> 00:26:35,393
Pops Kogoro...

501
00:26:35,925 --> 00:26:37,335
was just prosecuted...

502
00:26:37,508 --> 00:26:38,460
Huh?!

503
00:26:47,555 --> 00:26:48,597
Who is she?

504
00:26:49,152 --> 00:26:51,226
Wait... What did you just say?

505
00:26:51,546 --> 00:26:56,660
I said, I'm Kyoko Tachibana, and I’ve come
here today to represent the Sleeping Kogoro.

506
00:26:59,252 --> 00:27:01,786
These are all the cases I've handled so far.

507
00:27:02,466 --> 00:27:05,871
Huh... The Extremist Case of Nijoin University,

508
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:08,682
and... Oh yes, the METI Spy Case!

509
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,541
So, Public Security’s your specialty.

510
00:27:11,816 --> 00:27:14,887
Oh, then you’re the perfect person to handle this case!

511
00:27:15,275 --> 00:27:17,994
But wait, what’s your win/loss record like?

512
00:27:18,209 --> 00:27:18,574
Huh?

513
00:27:20,449 --> 00:27:22,410
Well, that's an interesting question!

514
00:27:23,085 --> 00:27:24,787
I've lost all of them.

515
00:27:25,368 --> 00:27:25,883
Huh?

516
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,083
Huh?

517
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:31,127
Well, these sort of cases are very hard to win.

518
00:27:31,226 --> 00:27:36,115
Yes. The cases they indict that are being
won by the prosecution are more than 90%.

519
00:27:36,242 --> 00:27:39,333
And it’s even higher when the
security police are involved…

520
00:27:39,736 --> 00:27:41,939
Basically, there’s no way I can win.

521
00:27:42,131 --> 00:27:44,377
But I’m what they call a “smart lawyer.”

522
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,510
What's that?

523
00:27:45,819 --> 00:27:48,980
She means a freelance lawyer with no office or overhead.

524
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,124
She works exclusively by phone.

525
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:53,865
Even at a disadvantage I can still take on the work!

526
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:56,343
That's why you're defending my dad?

527
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,385
You need an attorney, don't you?

528
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:02,072
I heard about your pending case, and I’d like to help!

529
00:28:02,943 --> 00:28:04,469
I suppose...

530
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,180
Wait, just hang on a second!

531
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:06,903
We're not done.

532
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,484
She won't work mom!

533
00:28:09,806 --> 00:28:12,131
She can't win! She plans not to!

534
00:28:12,378 --> 00:28:13,718
You have a point.

535
00:28:14,522 --> 00:28:16,982
But I have to say, she already looks incompetent...

536
00:28:16,985 --> 00:28:19,272
So the prosecution may take her lightly...

537
00:28:19,513 --> 00:28:20,990
We can't win that way!

538
00:28:21,154 --> 00:28:23,826
I think we’d be way better off with a public defender...

539
00:28:23,893 --> 00:28:25,850
If we do that, I won’t be able to help!

540
00:28:25,963 --> 00:28:26,384
Huh?

541
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,110
If she takes the job, I can still participate.

542
00:28:30,374 --> 00:28:31,173
Huh...

543
00:28:31,906 --> 00:28:35,075
Even so, she still worries me.

544
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,020
What's it's name?

545
00:28:36,035 --> 00:28:37,061
It's name is Goro!

546
00:28:41,481 --> 00:28:46,102
The police tell me, you're still
denying any involvement in this.

547
00:28:46,685 --> 00:28:50,385
Of course I am, because I am innocent.

548
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:53,611
But there is a lot of evidence pointing to your guilt.

549
00:28:53,954 --> 00:28:55,447
And it's all right in here.

550
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,854
That's what doesn't make any sense here!

551
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,586
Someone is framing me! I'm certain of it!

552
00:29:01,932 --> 00:29:02,762
Hmm...

553
00:29:02,917 --> 00:29:04,635
Well, from here on out...

554
00:29:04,783 --> 00:29:08,729
The district security police division
will be supervising this bomb case.

555
00:29:08,869 --> 00:29:10,235
Oh my goodness.

556
00:29:10,451 --> 00:29:15,377
Although I don't often handle many
security police cases, I have heard of him.

557
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,061
Is he known for being amazing or something?

558
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:22,257
Just Like Ms. Kisaki, he’s never lost a single case.

559
00:29:22,912 --> 00:29:24,973
Hehe... He's the complete opposite of me.

560
00:29:28,048 --> 00:29:30,654
Oh! I know all about this one!

561
00:29:30,956 --> 00:29:33,233
It’s the NAZU illegal access case.

562
00:29:33,331 --> 00:29:38,472
Huh? Wait, isn’t that... the space
organization, that's in the United States?

563
00:29:38,869 --> 00:29:43,445
Oh, yes. A game company employee hacked
into its system, just because he could do it.

564
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:46,248
Kusakabe prosecuted that case too.

565
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,250
And what happened with that one?

566
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:50,920
The defense lost, of course.

567
00:29:51,571 --> 00:29:52,890
What do you mean, "of course."

568
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,083
Oh man.

569
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,862
Despite everything I’ve already investigated,

570
00:30:03,116 --> 00:30:07,620
I still can’t peg a motive on
Kogoro Mori, and that bothers me...

571
00:30:08,151 --> 00:30:09,152
Hmm...

572
00:30:11,188 --> 00:30:13,135
Motive, huh?

573
00:30:14,954 --> 00:30:16,790
But look at all this evidence here.

574
00:30:17,653 --> 00:30:19,244
We could indict him tomorrow.

575
00:30:20,054 --> 00:30:21,431
Yes, but...

576
00:30:21,706 --> 00:30:26,727
For example, this record saying he
supposedly accessed the gas tap, as you see here,

577
00:30:27,084 --> 00:30:32,193
could also indicate his computer was actually
used by a third party, as a convenient relay point.

578
00:30:32,804 --> 00:30:36,810
Also possible... Someone placed the
blueprint and schedule in his computer,

579
00:30:37,207 --> 00:30:39,318
as a simple way to frame him for this horrible-

580
00:30:39,318 --> 00:30:40,338
Kusakabe.

581
00:30:40,888 --> 00:30:41,711
Honestly...

582
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:46,590
That’s an emotional, one-sided
deduction which disregards all this proof.

583
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,579
Supervisor Iwai, I will tell the
police to investigate in more detail...

584
00:30:51,604 --> 00:30:54,152
Go indict Kogoro Mori. Just do it.

585
00:30:54,757 --> 00:30:58,198
Please, they're the security police orders.

586
00:30:58,561 --> 00:30:59,539
Understand?

587
00:30:59,999 --> 00:31:03,329
By the "security police" do you mean us, the prosecutors?

588
00:31:03,847 --> 00:31:06,579
Or are you referring to the MPD?

589
00:31:09,579 --> 00:31:10,524
That will be all.

590
00:31:11,274 --> 00:31:12,350
You're dismissed.

591
00:31:12,515 --> 00:31:13,308
... Hmph.

592
00:31:25,536 --> 00:31:27,736
Were you asked to investigate further?

593
00:31:28,295 --> 00:31:30,333
Yes, by Kusakabe.

594
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:33,936
Then depending on how things
go, maybe Dad won’t be indicted?

595
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:35,563
No.

596
00:31:35,944 --> 00:31:38,606
Kusakabe asked us to do this for him personally.

597
00:31:38,979 --> 00:31:41,314
The SPD still plan to indict Mr. Mori.

598
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,826
The police aren’t supposed to have jurisdiction over this.

599
00:31:45,045 --> 00:31:48,004
Technically, they should be supervised by the prosecution!

600
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:52,174
Indictments are a prosecutor’s exclusive authority...

601
00:31:53,685 --> 00:31:55,385
Yes, exactly right.

602
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:59,230
But, that's only for the civil and criminal divisions.

603
00:31:59,698 --> 00:32:01,995
Besides, the Security Police have...

604
00:32:02,741 --> 00:32:06,380
Well, other circumstances. So, they do things differently.

605
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,430
You understand what I'm saying.

606
00:32:08,852 --> 00:32:09,255
Oh...

607
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,487
Oh, well, you see, there’s a lot involved here...

608
00:32:14,212 --> 00:32:17,572
The MPD, Safety and Security,
and the Prosecutor's department,

609
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:19,351
all have their own divisions.

610
00:32:19,851 --> 00:32:23,189
The police are supposed to send
what they find to the prosecutor.

611
00:32:23,587 --> 00:32:27,360
The prosecutor takes that and
investigates the case all over again.

612
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:31,805
As you know, based on whatever the investigation yields,

613
00:32:31,975 --> 00:32:35,798
the prosecution gets to decide
whether to indict a suspect or not.

614
00:32:37,066 --> 00:32:40,803
But, this doesn’t apply to their security division.

615
00:32:41,949 --> 00:32:46,674
Put bluntly, the prosecution’s police
don’t stand a chance against the MPD’s.

616
00:32:47,774 --> 00:32:52,426
They’re outgunned in both number of
investigators, and their skill and experience level.

617
00:32:53,727 --> 00:32:58,560
As a result, the security police
has influence on who’s to be indicted.

618
00:32:58,671 --> 00:33:00,896
Security police influence…

619
00:33:01,502 --> 00:33:04,273
Specifically, when the summit hall was just blown up...

620
00:33:04,864 --> 00:33:08,341
It was as if they had some dirt
thrown right into their faces.

621
00:33:08,794 --> 00:33:13,059
So it’s conceivable that they’d do almost
anything to indict and convict the perpetrator.

622
00:33:13,645 --> 00:33:15,935
Which means, he’ll be indicted then...

623
00:33:17,243 --> 00:33:19,175
Yes, I'm afraid that's right.

624
00:33:19,517 --> 00:33:20,567
No...

625
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:21,487
Hmm...

626
00:33:23,348 --> 00:33:26,224
It's as if this lawyer wants him to get indicted...

627
00:33:31,723 --> 00:33:36,083
You’re investigating whether Pops' computer’s
been tampered with, by somebody else, right?

628
00:33:36,657 --> 00:33:42,390
Uh, well yes. In fact, Prosecutor
Kusakabe asked us to do an additional search.

629
00:33:43,045 --> 00:33:45,276
Would you mind telling me what you can then?

630
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,921
Shinichi wants to know any information that you may have,

631
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,559
so he can try to save Pops Kogoro.

632
00:33:51,831 --> 00:33:54,770
Kogoro Mori? What’s going on with him?

633
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:56,875
Mr. Amuro!

634
00:33:57,818 --> 00:33:58,822
Were you listening?

635
00:33:59,140 --> 00:33:59,768
Listening?

636
00:34:00,136 --> 00:34:02,357
I was just concerned about Mr. Mori,

637
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:05,329
and thought I would bring him
something tasty to eat from Poirot.

638
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:08,801
Oh,well... Mr. Mori isn’t here anymore.

639
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,669
If he’s indicted, it’s protocol.

640
00:34:11,904 --> 00:34:13,862
He’d be taken right to the detention center.

641
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,396
A procedure you’re familiar with yourself.

642
00:34:16,676 --> 00:34:21,257
Oh, that’s it huh? You sure do know a lot of information.

643
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:25,890
And remember, that food is
contraband at the detention center!

644
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,460
Right, understood!

645
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:31,750
What's he after anyway...

646
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,031
2291, succeeded.

647
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:42,637
Wait... What’s going on here?

648
00:34:43,728 --> 00:34:44,330
Damn!

649
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:46,525
Hey! Officer!

650
00:34:46,825 --> 00:34:50,439
Wait a sec! I need the laptop you took from Pop's house!

651
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:53,808
My favorite game is still installed on it! Please!

652
00:34:53,811 --> 00:34:55,196
But that's our official evidence.

653
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:55,598
Come on!

654
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:57,185
I can't. Not yet.

655
00:34:57,344 --> 00:35:00,218
Alright, stop it Conan, that is enough!

656
00:35:00,618 --> 00:35:04,250
But it’s a special program that Doc created just for me!

657
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,736
Hmph.

658
00:35:12,098 --> 00:35:15,198
Oh, there you are! I've been trying to get a hold of you.

659
00:35:15,454 --> 00:35:16,262
Huh? Uh...

660
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:22,050
Oh, I guess my battery must have died.

661
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,927
Can you charge it using that?

662
00:35:25,092 --> 00:35:26,502
Oh! Thanks a lot!

663
00:35:31,142 --> 00:35:33,557
My battery usually lasts much longer...

664
00:35:33,973 --> 00:35:36,226
Uh... So what were you calling me about?

665
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,096
All the case files are gonna be delivered here soon.

666
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:42,057
She thought it would be good
idea for you to see them, too.

667
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,904
Conan has a real knack for noticing
little details that others miss.

668
00:35:46,226 --> 00:35:49,956
And so if that happens, he can
share them with Shinichi as well.

669
00:35:51,231 --> 00:35:54,588
Right! Shinichi's gonna be the
first person I call for sure!

670
00:35:55,288 --> 00:35:57,161
Thanks Conan, you're the best.

671
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,967
Sorry for the wait.

672
00:36:00,695 --> 00:36:03,423
Here's all the evidence that the prosecutor submitted.

673
00:36:04,304 --> 00:36:05,337
Huh? Does that mean...

674
00:36:05,881 --> 00:36:07,911
That Pops has already been indicted?

675
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:12,290
No, but we got word from the
prosecutor that he would be indicted soon.

676
00:36:13,287 --> 00:36:14,299
Poor Dad...

677
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:18,517
Try not to worry. We're going to get him through this.

678
00:36:18,758 --> 00:36:19,781
Please, over there.

679
00:36:19,985 --> 00:36:20,630
Yes, ma'am.

680
00:36:21,042 --> 00:36:24,441
His oral statement, and the investigator’s report.

681
00:36:24,652 --> 00:36:27,472
As well as, pictures of the site taken by forensics.

682
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:28,839
That's a lot.

683
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,505
Hmm...

684
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:32,774
There has to be some kind of clue in there...

685
00:36:33,382 --> 00:36:36,100
Damn, there's got to be something...

686
00:36:38,638 --> 00:36:39,349
Huh?

687
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:44,991
What's the matter?

688
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:47,140
Uh... I-It's nothing.

689
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:48,931
It seems familiar...

690
00:36:49,798 --> 00:36:53,596
Looking at this, it's easy to see
how they were able to carry this out.

691
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:56,206
The details of this police report...

692
00:36:56,373 --> 00:36:59,343
read like a step-by-step criminal's handbook...

693
00:36:59,788 --> 00:37:01,093
A handbook...

694
00:37:07,056 --> 00:37:08,596
Yes, this is Tachibana.

695
00:37:09,425 --> 00:37:10,739
He's in court?

696
00:37:10,835 --> 00:37:11,573
Huh?

697
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:13,060
Yes.

698
00:37:13,746 --> 00:37:15,436
They're in pre-trial hearings?

699
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,203
Ms. Iwai!

700
00:37:19,308 --> 00:37:21,090
What on earth were you thinking?!

701
00:37:21,142 --> 00:37:23,953
The lawyers knew he was getting indicted, but I didnt!

702
00:37:24,604 --> 00:37:26,463
Must I repeat myself?

703
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,855
The security police make this decision.

704
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:33,780
First they forcefully decide to indict him and
now they get to determine it’s timing as well?

705
00:37:34,077 --> 00:37:35,885
The court has contacted us.

706
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:41,040
They said in no uncertain terms,
that tomorrow, we and all the attorneys,

707
00:37:41,129 --> 00:37:43,615
will begin crucial pretrial procedures.

708
00:37:43,943 --> 00:37:47,367
But why did they exclusively
choose to inform to you, Supervisor?

709
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:49,963
I’m the prosecutor in charge, here!

710
00:37:50,628 --> 00:37:54,479
Let me know when it’s finished. There’s no time to waste.

711
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,302
I can’t find that big container of ice cream!

712
00:38:00,429 --> 00:38:01,381
Oh no...

713
00:38:03,078 --> 00:38:05,663
Oh, I’m gonna go find someone who can help me.

714
00:38:06,068 --> 00:38:08,302
If you don’t mind, you go buy the flour and eggs.

715
00:38:08,392 --> 00:38:08,998
Thanks!

716
00:38:09,432 --> 00:38:12,835
Azusa, you’re gonna make some lucky man a great wife.

717
00:38:13,078 --> 00:38:15,430
Huh?! Are you crazy?

718
00:38:15,431 --> 00:38:17,651
- People can hear you make comments like that! - Huh?

719
00:38:17,697 --> 00:38:20,566
You're really popular with the high
school girls that come into our shop!

720
00:38:20,629 --> 00:38:24,056
The other day, things got heated up with
postings, that I was trying to seduce you!

721
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,487
And of them could be here! You never
know who’s listening to you these days.

722
00:38:29,798 --> 00:38:30,689
Heh, that's true.

723
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,745
Mr. Furuya.

724
00:38:40,429 --> 00:38:43,155
Why do you insist on making a case out of this?

725
00:38:44,025 --> 00:38:47,772
If it’s ruled an accident, we
can’t get a warrant. That's why.

726
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:52,465
I understand, but the security police shouldn’t
need a warrant to conduct special searches.

727
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,302
Which is why, we’ve got to
leave room for a legal method, too.

728
00:38:57,337 --> 00:38:59,520
We can’t shoot ourselves in the foot.

729
00:38:59,994 --> 00:39:06,035
The illegal procedures that we carry out...
We’ve got to end them ourselves. That's our job.

730
00:39:06,941 --> 00:39:09,968
However, whether we make this whole thing above board,

731
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:14,250
or whether we cover it up, is
also something we need to take of.

732
00:39:15,015 --> 00:39:15,815
I agree.

733
00:39:16,226 --> 00:39:20,176
But first, we have to determine
which direction is better for us.

734
00:39:20,877 --> 00:39:22,426
For Japan, I mean.

735
00:39:24,911 --> 00:39:28,168
Hey, Mr. Amuro! They only have
the little ice cream containers...

736
00:39:30,842 --> 00:39:32,046
First things first.

737
00:39:32,094 --> 00:39:35,907
Let’s see the evidence. Present your
facts and show me what you’ve gathered.

738
00:39:36,214 --> 00:39:37,799
Then we can proceed accordingly.

739
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:38,940
Yes, sir.

740
00:39:39,221 --> 00:39:42,177
As you asked, I have an extensive list of evidence.

741
00:39:44,523 --> 00:39:45,138
Ran.

742
00:39:45,506 --> 00:39:45,831
Oh.

743
00:39:46,456 --> 00:39:48,029
Just try to relax.

744
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,675
Okay, but…

745
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,280
The trial isn’t happening for a few more days right?

746
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,150
Right.

747
00:39:54,484 --> 00:39:56,835
It's just the pre-trial procedure.

748
00:39:57,155 --> 00:40:00,945
They have to sort through the issues
and evidence, then they choose the date.

749
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:02,366
I've told you this.

750
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,969
I know, it's just that...

751
00:40:07,136 --> 00:40:08,053
Miss Kyoko!

752
00:40:17,259 --> 00:40:17,857
Hm?

753
00:40:18,668 --> 00:40:20,509
Ms. Iwai, it's Kusakabe.

754
00:40:21,157 --> 00:40:24,143
We’ve just finished the required pre-trial procedures.

755
00:40:25,261 --> 00:40:27,697
What was evidence that Kusakabe brought in?

756
00:40:27,933 --> 00:40:30,966
It was exactly the same as what we received beforehand.

757
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:32,666
Here's the list.

758
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,910
And the date of the trial?

759
00:40:36,198 --> 00:40:39,546
It’s been decided, and put into the court schedule.

760
00:40:39,757 --> 00:40:43,195
Ah... I'm sorry but you need to look at this.

761
00:40:43,278 --> 00:40:44,624
I-I'm going to the restroom!

762
00:40:45,673 --> 00:40:47,318
Wait, Miss Kyoko!

763
00:40:47,421 --> 00:40:49,168
The restroom is on the other side!

764
00:40:49,369 --> 00:40:50,533
Miss Kyoko!

765
00:40:51,662 --> 00:40:52,003
Hm...

766
00:40:55,485 --> 00:40:56,565
The wire tap...

767
00:40:57,384 --> 00:40:59,321
The one I rigged Officer Kazami with...

768
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,450
He must be nearby.

769
00:41:01,991 --> 00:41:04,104
I see. Please carry on.

770
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:04,992
He's here!

771
00:41:07,626 --> 00:41:10,072
Don't tell me that he's inside the courtroom?!

772
00:41:15,754 --> 00:41:16,634
Where is he?!

773
00:41:19,262 --> 00:41:19,651
Huh?!

774
00:41:20,141 --> 00:41:22,139
Is that Miss Kyoko's ringtone?

775
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:26,374
Yes, is this Miss Kyoko? There’s something
important I’d like to confirm with you.

776
00:41:26,634 --> 00:41:28,153
Oh, I'll be right back.

777
00:41:29,629 --> 00:41:33,476
Why am I hearing her voice coming
from Detective Kazami’s wire tap?

778
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:37,648
Does she just happen to be standing close to him?

779
00:41:38,226 --> 00:41:40,730
No. The reception's too clear.

780
00:41:41,448 --> 00:41:44,258
They’ve definitely been in
close proximity for some time...

781
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,201
This is no coincidence.

782
00:41:53,992 --> 00:41:58,019
The official report being released by
us the security police, is as follows...

783
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:01,515
"Nor" was used to illegally access the bomb site.

784
00:42:01,781 --> 00:42:02,761
What's "Nor?"

785
00:42:03,413 --> 00:42:06,194
It’s a browser software that encodes the IP address.

786
00:42:06,266 --> 00:42:09,714
And makes it impossible to trace
by going through several computers.

787
00:42:11,182 --> 00:42:14,282
Isn’t there’s some way you can
manage to unveil the encryption?

788
00:42:14,808 --> 00:42:16,398
Technically no, by design.

789
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:21,432
Although, if there happens to be a defect
or bug in the structure of NOR’s browser,

790
00:42:21,563 --> 00:42:23,569
it is possible to identify the user.

791
00:42:24,762 --> 00:42:25,873
And additionally,

792
00:42:26,685 --> 00:42:29,377
if we can weaken the perp’s NOR browser’s defenses,

793
00:42:30,077 --> 00:42:31,761
there’s a chance that we could track it.

794
00:42:33,392 --> 00:42:36,503
The entire department is currently
working on it day and night...

795
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:40,205
To attempt to trace the server, and find the user.

796
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:42,787
Excuse me.

797
00:42:44,435 --> 00:42:46,346
I have an urgent matter to attend to.

798
00:42:46,638 --> 00:42:47,888
I'm afraid I must go.

799
00:42:48,184 --> 00:42:49,017
Very well.

800
00:42:53,225 --> 00:42:55,007
You're wire tapping that meeting?

801
00:42:55,934 --> 00:42:56,414
Ah...

802
00:42:57,294 --> 00:42:58,590
How'd you know I was here?

803
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:03,381
When it comes to Kogoro Mori, you sure give it your all.

804
00:43:04,173 --> 00:43:05,002
Or maybe...

805
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:07,388
This really has more to do with Ran?

806
00:43:07,553 --> 00:43:07,965
Hmph...

807
00:43:08,951 --> 00:43:09,674
Huh?

808
00:43:09,912 --> 00:43:11,811
It's fine. Come out.

809
00:43:14,648 --> 00:43:16,061
I came as fast as I could.

810
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:18,937
Why'd you call? Mr. Furuya?

811
00:43:23,633 --> 00:43:25,546
Huh... ugh!

812
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:36,750
And you call yourself a Security Officer.

813
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,251
I-I'm sorry.

814
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,785
But who... How did...?

815
00:43:47,275 --> 00:43:48,119
Hey, wait!

816
00:43:55,632 --> 00:43:56,661
Was it you?

817
00:43:57,128 --> 00:43:58,749
Did you put that bug on me?

818
00:44:00,572 --> 00:44:01,849
No, it can't be.

819
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,652
A child could never.

820
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:05,265
Toru Amuro...

821
00:44:05,329 --> 00:44:09,205
Is in charge of the security
police nationwide, and it's alias is…

822
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:09,991
"Zero."

823
00:44:13,463 --> 00:44:15,752
The only ones who can get close to him,

824
00:44:16,325 --> 00:44:19,779
are a handful of detectives,
including the security police.

825
00:44:20,395 --> 00:44:22,395
And you're one of them, aren't you?

826
00:44:23,905 --> 00:44:26,702
Who are you anyway? How do you..?

827
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,767
I'm Conan Edogawa,

828
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:31,849
and I'm a detective.

829
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,079
The man you keep referring to as Mr. Amuro...

830
00:44:47,391 --> 00:44:47,984
Huh...

831
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:49,978
... is a murderer.

832
00:44:50,704 --> 00:44:51,345
Huh?!

833
00:44:57,749 --> 00:45:01,912
Last year, he interrogated a
man, who then committed suicide.

834
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,586
Committed suicide?

835
00:45:05,611 --> 00:45:09,046
I'm sorry... This is too serious for a child...

836
00:45:11,462 --> 00:45:14,567
But for some reason, it feels
as if I can talk to you about it.

837
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:16,958
You sure are a strange one.

838
00:45:18,859 --> 00:45:22,514
Then, as soon as the division
isolates the access point via Nor,

839
00:45:22,546 --> 00:45:24,190
bring in Kogoro Mori...

840
00:45:24,442 --> 00:45:24,976
Hm?

841
00:45:25,165 --> 00:45:26,065
Sorry to barge in!

842
00:45:26,153 --> 00:45:28,519
We have a serious situation going on outside!

843
00:45:28,678 --> 00:45:29,503
Huh?

844
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:33,740
Huh? Ah!!

845
00:45:33,837 --> 00:45:35,906
Huh? Argh...

846
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:39,913
Ah! What's happening?!

847
00:45:44,886 --> 00:45:46,770
Mommy, come quick! It's a...

848
00:45:47,332 --> 00:45:48,085
Oh my!

849
00:45:51,595 --> 00:45:53,139
What's happening?!

850
00:45:53,768 --> 00:45:54,649
Woah!

851
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:57,454
What's going on around here?!

852
00:45:57,925 --> 00:45:59,982
How many times do I have to tell you?!

853
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,252
Argh, woah!

854
00:46:02,984 --> 00:46:05,725
Due to the Tokyo summit scheduled for today,

855
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:08,410
special precautionary measures have been taken,

856
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:11,380
but a series of inexplicable phenomena has been occurring

857
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,988
Though there is no official announcement yet from the MPD.

858
00:46:14,489 --> 00:46:18,002
Citizens of all participating nations, as well as Japan’s

859
00:46:18,034 --> 00:46:21,585
are voicing their concerns, grievances
and criticisms to the government.

860
00:46:22,418 --> 00:46:25,737
Numerous reports of exploding
electrical devices are pouring in...

861
00:46:25,737 --> 00:46:26,715
Huh? Woah?!

862
00:46:27,423 --> 00:46:29,391
What on earth is happening?

863
00:46:29,851 --> 00:46:32,860
I repeat. MPD has not yet made an official announcement,

864
00:46:32,917 --> 00:46:36,206
Ugh... What is this criminal trying to achieve?

865
00:46:36,292 --> 00:46:37,860
of electronic devices self-destructing.

866
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,485
Electronic devices...

867
00:46:41,529 --> 00:46:46,199
By setting the temperature and cooking time, you
can make everything from stews, to roasts, to soup,

868
00:46:46,354 --> 00:46:47,564
All from your smartphone.

869
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,511
I get it!

870
00:46:49,941 --> 00:46:53,104
The first act of terror was to bomb the summit hall!

871
00:47:01,064 --> 00:47:02,034
What's the latest?

872
00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:04,480
Command headquarters is in utter chaos!

873
00:47:04,617 --> 00:47:07,395
There are over 100 sites that have exploded!

874
00:47:07,542 --> 00:47:08,810
Inside, MPD!

875
00:47:15,692 --> 00:47:18,834
Hey, Conan. I'm sorry, but I can't talk right now.

876
00:47:18,857 --> 00:47:22,928
Inspector Megure! This is all
IoT terrorism! I’m sure of it!

877
00:47:22,971 --> 00:47:23,460
Huh?

878
00:47:23,643 --> 00:47:25,384
What do you mean, IoT terrorism?

879
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:30,508
Someone’s altering electrical devices into
makeshift bombs, and using the internet to blow them up!

880
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,981
So if you cut off their internet connection
you can make all of this come to an end!

881
00:47:39,787 --> 00:47:41,343
IoT terrorism?

882
00:47:44,272 --> 00:47:45,800
That kid's pretty sharp.

883
00:47:48,527 --> 00:47:50,370
That pressure cooker found at the site,

884
00:47:50,422 --> 00:47:52,649
was probably an IoT appliance, too!

885
00:47:55,142 --> 00:47:58,045
First, the perp was able to unlock the gas tap.

886
00:47:58,489 --> 00:48:00,365
Then he filled the site with gas.

887
00:48:00,697 --> 00:48:02,922
Rigged the IoT device to explode,

888
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,050
and then bombed the summit hall!

889
00:48:08,538 --> 00:48:10,319
No, he couldn't have...

890
00:48:10,575 --> 00:48:11,165
I know.

891
00:48:11,591 --> 00:48:14,197
Pops Kogoro is innocent. He couldn’t have done it.

892
00:48:14,277 --> 00:48:15,612
Really is that the truth?

893
00:48:15,992 --> 00:48:18,192
Huh?!

894
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:22,250
Hehe, I mean, that’s what Shinichi
asked me to pass on to you, Inspector!

895
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:26,915
Tell me Conan...

896
00:48:27,976 --> 00:48:30,926
Shinichi's doing everything he can to,

897
00:48:31,282 --> 00:48:32,444
help us, isn't he?

898
00:48:33,957 --> 00:48:34,560
Huh...

899
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:35,536
Hmph.

900
00:48:39,017 --> 00:48:39,796
Come on.

901
00:48:39,821 --> 00:48:43,266
I'm not doing it just for your Dad. This is for you too.

902
00:48:44,816 --> 00:48:45,602
Interesting.

903
00:48:45,975 --> 00:48:50,227
If what you’re telling me is true then you
may have a decent chance of winning the case.

904
00:48:50,471 --> 00:48:53,427
Yep, because Pops is being detained at the police station,

905
00:48:53,634 --> 00:48:55,612
and he has no internet access there!

906
00:48:56,399 --> 00:48:57,010
No.

907
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:02,340
Even if one’s being detained, an IoT terror
attack can still be carried out effectively,

908
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,844
if it’s been pre-scheduled.

909
00:49:04,165 --> 00:49:04,606
Huh?

910
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,100
If they identify the access point by tracing the server,

911
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:10,930
then in their eyes, Mr. Mori is as good as guilty.

912
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,487
That's impossible!

913
00:49:13,805 --> 00:49:17,119
Yeah, but isn’t it kind of hard
for them to trace the server like that?

914
00:49:17,241 --> 00:49:19,538
Can they get that finished before the trial begins?

915
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:22,848
The security police are doing
it. They wont have a problem.

916
00:49:23,142 --> 00:49:23,912
Hang on...

917
00:49:24,626 --> 00:49:27,894
How are you so sure that the
security police are the ones doing it?

918
00:49:28,194 --> 00:49:29,981
Uh...

919
00:49:30,123 --> 00:49:31,449
Huh? Ah!

920
00:49:31,482 --> 00:49:32,982
Oh! I'm sorry!

921
00:49:35,062 --> 00:49:36,742
Let me explain this to you better.

922
00:49:36,884 --> 00:49:40,557
You see, the security police
often handle tasks of this nature.

923
00:49:41,316 --> 00:49:45,508
This branch of law enforcement, has a
lot of people who collaborate with it.

924
00:49:45,614 --> 00:49:50,044
By people who collaborate, you mean
civilians who assist with police investigations?

925
00:49:50,515 --> 00:49:51,242
That's right.

926
00:49:51,517 --> 00:49:54,535
Especially when it comes to
cases involving targeted servers,

927
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,701
those subject to wire tapping laws.

928
00:49:57,004 --> 00:49:59,665
They use them to collaborate on those type of cases.

929
00:50:00,326 --> 00:50:02,415
If one of them were to look deeper into this,

930
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,758
they may find evidence that
Mr. Mori had accessed the computer.

931
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:10,413
That is of course to say, if any
such evidence actually even exists!

932
00:50:11,417 --> 00:50:13,259
Oh just leave that, it's broken.

933
00:50:13,371 --> 00:50:14,754
Really? Are you sure?

934
00:50:14,779 --> 00:50:16,978
Yes. I'll probably end up getting a new one.

935
00:50:17,794 --> 00:50:21,324
This doesn't feel right...
There's still something about her.

936
00:50:21,608 --> 00:50:23,365
But I can't put my finger on it...

937
00:50:23,748 --> 00:50:27,051
MPD has officially announced that it is highly likely,

938
00:50:27,062 --> 00:50:32,248
that IoT terror is responsible for the series
of bombings that have recently disrupted the city.

939
00:50:33,234 --> 00:50:36,393
Who’d of expected this would turn out to be an IoT attack…

940
00:50:37,804 --> 00:50:41,289
Of course you did. Who else but
you could’ve figured that out?

941
00:50:42,024 --> 00:50:44,404
Actually, someone else gets the credit for that.

942
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:46,596
But now we have a credible case.

943
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:50,750
That’s why I want to get those
side issues wrapped up, ASAP.

944
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:53,702
And get our "collaborator" off the hook.

945
00:51:00,047 --> 00:51:04,782
Before that, I need to know what intel
Zero has at this point, and how much.

946
00:51:04,925 --> 00:51:05,560
Right.

947
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:09,533
NAZU?

948
00:51:09,923 --> 00:51:13,195
I’m gonna send all this to the
cyber criminal management division.

949
00:51:13,688 --> 00:51:16,453
We’ll make that department report it at the conference.

950
00:51:16,674 --> 00:51:19,146
Hold on, why should they get the credit for this?

951
00:51:19,511 --> 00:51:22,284
As the security police division, this is our job.

952
00:51:22,724 --> 00:51:23,165
Heh.

953
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:25,152
It's a reward.

954
00:51:25,502 --> 00:51:29,029
Thanks to them, we can now
investigate these bombings legitimately.

955
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:30,491
Besides...

956
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,263
The top investigator behind it already knows,

957
00:51:33,844 --> 00:51:36,076
this information came right from Zero.

958
00:51:36,651 --> 00:51:40,025
Hm... You frighten me quite a bit, Mr. Furuya.

959
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:46,945
Kazami, there are two other men that
should scare you far more than I do.

960
00:51:47,741 --> 00:51:49,161
What's interesting is...

961
00:51:49,726 --> 00:51:51,744
One of them is still just a child.

962
00:51:52,371 --> 00:51:53,880
Hmph, oh yes.

963
00:51:54,033 --> 00:51:57,274
In fact, I know precisely the kid you're talking about.

964
00:51:57,968 --> 00:51:58,704
... Huh?

965
00:52:04,354 --> 00:52:05,803
The latest report reveals,

966
00:52:05,843 --> 00:52:10,018
that traces of illegal digital access
were found originating from Mori’s computer.

967
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:13,088
Looks like it was used as a relay point after all.

968
00:52:14,786 --> 00:52:16,412
Is any of it traceable?

969
00:52:17,161 --> 00:52:21,828
Unfortunately, the culprit accessed the
system using a burner phone and public wifi.

970
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,017
So, no...

971
00:52:23,142 --> 00:52:24,230
But at that time,

972
00:52:24,406 --> 00:52:26,765
Mr. Mori was in custody at the station,

973
00:52:26,971 --> 00:52:30,307
so obviously it would have been
impossible for him to be at the site.

974
00:52:30,765 --> 00:52:34,796
Also, not only was Nor used as
the relay point in the last case,

975
00:52:34,867 --> 00:52:37,357
it worked so well, it was used again this time.

976
00:52:37,417 --> 00:52:39,048
Ideal for IoT terror.

977
00:52:39,982 --> 00:52:42,098
So it's the same perp after all?

978
00:52:42,447 --> 00:52:45,292
How are we coming along with identifying the server?

979
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:49,050
Ah, yes... According to cyber crime management intel,

980
00:52:49,328 --> 00:52:52,841
the server is buried, within the NAZU network.

981
00:52:53,275 --> 00:52:54,071
Huh?

982
00:52:59,919 --> 00:53:02,127
Hey! I got here as soon as I could!

983
00:53:02,377 --> 00:53:06,370
Ms. Kuriyama! Thank you for
coming, sorry to ruin your vacation?

984
00:53:06,628 --> 00:53:07,505
That's okay!

985
00:53:07,737 --> 00:53:10,110
How can a legal assistant just sit idly by,

986
00:53:10,114 --> 00:53:12,559
when her boss is going through such a major crisis?

987
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:13,853
You're so helpful.

988
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:15,483
Oh, here!

989
00:53:15,977 --> 00:53:19,186
It’s the background check info
that I ran on Kyoko Tachibana.

990
00:53:19,269 --> 00:53:19,678
Huh?

991
00:53:20,188 --> 00:53:23,786
I mean, Shinichi Kudo asked me if
I could do a little digging on her.

992
00:53:24,437 --> 00:53:25,572
Hm? Seriously?

993
00:53:25,862 --> 00:53:29,914
Oh, I see! So that's what he requested...

994
00:53:30,205 --> 00:53:33,201
Why would he ask you to investigate Ms.Tachibana?

995
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:34,822
Hey, uh...

996
00:53:34,868 --> 00:53:35,386
Huh?

997
00:53:35,653 --> 00:53:39,857
It may seem out of the ordinary, but
I’m sure Shinichi has his reasons for it.

998
00:53:40,141 --> 00:53:42,129
Shall we review the materials?

999
00:53:43,591 --> 00:53:48,128
I found out that last year Ms.Tachibana’s
office clerk had caused an incident.

1000
00:53:48,468 --> 00:53:52,260
Huh? But she had told us that she was a “smart lawyer.”

1001
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,508
Well, she closed her office last year.

1002
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:59,234
She had to, because a guy named Fumikazu Haba,

1003
00:53:59,314 --> 00:54:00,864
one of her assistants at the time,

1004
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,829
was arrested for hacking into the
mainframe of a huge game company.

1005
00:54:05,228 --> 00:54:10,193
Not long after, Haba committed suicide at the
detention center where he was being detained.

1006
00:54:10,711 --> 00:54:12,152
Ah... Suicide?

1007
00:54:12,176 --> 00:54:12,814
Uh...

1008
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:15,261
Suicide...

1009
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,251
And what does this mean?

1010
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:26,202
We’ve determined that Kogoro Mori’s computer
had been accessed and manipulated by a third party.

1011
00:54:26,567 --> 00:54:30,079
And therefore, it’s very unlikely that he is involved.

1012
00:54:31,042 --> 00:54:31,787
Okay.

1013
00:54:32,327 --> 00:54:33,400
I think we're done.

1014
00:54:33,885 --> 00:54:36,785
Yes, but what about the
fingerprints they found at the site?

1015
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:40,828
Ah, the one thing about burned on fingerprints...

1016
00:54:41,263 --> 00:54:43,133
Is that they're easily transferred.

1017
00:54:44,977 --> 00:54:47,686
Is that what the security police concluded?

1018
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,680
Don't indict Kogoro Mori. I mean it.

1019
00:54:50,904 --> 00:54:54,796
Your listening to the security police?
Are they making our decisions again?

1020
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:56,401
That is quite enough.

1021
00:54:57,824 --> 00:54:58,387
Huh?

1022
00:54:58,766 --> 00:55:00,237
Huh?! Ah!

1023
00:55:16,288 --> 00:55:17,923
Huh? Prosecutor Iwai?

1024
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:18,629
Yes.

1025
00:55:19,051 --> 00:55:23,254
She sustained only minor burns,
but went to the hospital just in case.

1026
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,060
So then... Was this IoT terror too?

1027
00:55:26,687 --> 00:55:28,171
When we checked her phone,

1028
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:31,953
we actually found it had been accessed via Nor.

1029
00:55:33,024 --> 00:55:33,732
Excuse me...

1030
00:55:34,763 --> 00:55:35,710
This is Shiratori.

1031
00:55:36,548 --> 00:55:38,453
Huh..? What?

1032
00:55:38,787 --> 00:55:39,842
That's great news!

1033
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:43,110
Looks like Mr. Mori’s indictment’s been called off!

1034
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:45,236
Huh...

1035
00:55:45,982 --> 00:55:47,556
Oh, Mom!

1036
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:52,277
Heheh, great news Ran! I'm so glad!

1037
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,468
Mhm, thank you!

1038
00:55:55,448 --> 00:55:58,445
I gotta tell Shinichi, Sonoko too!

1039
00:55:58,681 --> 00:55:59,094
Heh.

1040
00:56:00,492 --> 00:56:02,127
But there's still one more thing.

1041
00:56:02,902 --> 00:56:06,848
This is the report from the prosecutor
who interrogated Fumikazu Haba.

1042
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:11,917
Oh, Ms. Iwai, she was just treated for burns.

1043
00:56:11,942 --> 00:56:13,028
Her phone caught fire.

1044
00:56:13,056 --> 00:56:14,743
She was in charge last year.

1045
00:56:15,131 --> 00:56:15,903
Yes.

1046
00:56:16,125 --> 00:56:18,876
But now, she's Supervising Prosecutor,

1047
00:56:18,948 --> 00:56:21,475
and oversees Mr. Kusakabe, her former colleague.

1048
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:22,213
That's right.

1049
00:56:22,238 --> 00:56:22,550
Hm?

1050
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,417
As a result of Haba's felony case,

1051
00:56:25,508 --> 00:56:28,697
Prosecutor Iwai got herself promoted almost immediately.

1052
00:56:29,647 --> 00:56:31,323
And? What's all this about?

1053
00:56:31,347 --> 00:56:31,668
Uh...

1054
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:36,975
It looks like you’ve been trying to investigating
me and my former office clerk for some reason.

1055
00:56:37,245 --> 00:56:38,142
I, uh...

1056
00:56:38,649 --> 00:56:42,260
No, you see, I simply asked Ms. Kuriyama to help me.

1057
00:56:42,418 --> 00:56:44,585
It's just a routine background check.

1058
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:49,607
It's extremely thorough.

1059
00:56:49,815 --> 00:56:51,958
Congrats on being so efficient too.

1060
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:53,165
Her "too?"

1061
00:56:53,561 --> 00:56:56,857
It seems as if you're saying
Mr. Haba was like that as well.

1062
00:56:57,252 --> 00:56:59,714
He committed a felony against that game company,

1063
00:56:59,897 --> 00:57:04,243
and was the person responsible for
sending your law firm into bankruptcy, right?

1064
00:57:05,812 --> 00:57:07,686
It wasn't Fumikazu's fault!

1065
00:57:07,711 --> 00:57:08,364
Uh...

1066
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,136
It was because...

1067
00:57:10,852 --> 00:57:11,964
I couldn't...

1068
00:57:12,601 --> 00:57:12,990
Ugh...

1069
00:57:14,091 --> 00:57:16,040
It seems like you guys were close.

1070
00:57:16,411 --> 00:57:19,748
Not everyone's on a first-name basis with their employees,

1071
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,069
but you were.

1072
00:57:26,711 --> 00:57:28,956
Are you also aware that he took his own life?

1073
00:57:29,005 --> 00:57:30,562
Um... Yes.

1074
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:33,218
At the detention center...

1075
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:37,428
He did it after the security police
got through with their interrogation.

1076
00:57:38,006 --> 00:57:39,407
It was very strange.

1077
00:57:41,322 --> 00:57:45,993
Last year, he interrogated a
man who then committed suicide.

1078
00:57:46,697 --> 00:57:48,194
Why would they do that?

1079
00:57:49,197 --> 00:57:51,069
I've never heard of such a thing.

1080
00:57:51,452 --> 00:57:55,853
Yeah, well, there were plenty of other
peculiarities that surrounded Fumikazu’s suicide

1081
00:57:56,433 --> 00:57:57,512
If I may...

1082
00:57:57,591 --> 00:58:01,755
Mr. Haba was a law student for a brief
time until he was dismissed, I believe.

1083
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,337
You mean he was studying to become a judge?

1084
00:58:04,465 --> 00:58:05,011
Yes,

1085
00:58:05,261 --> 00:58:06,186
but however...

1086
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:09,423
during his graduation ceremony from law school...

1087
00:58:09,682 --> 00:58:11,065
There was an incident...

1088
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:15,899
Those of you who are aiming to become judges or lawyers,

1089
00:58:15,924 --> 00:58:18,285
from today forth should never forget what you...

1090
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:18,923
Head Master!

1091
00:58:18,948 --> 00:58:19,198
Huh..?

1092
00:58:19,394 --> 00:58:20,281
Head Master!

1093
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:21,241
Why was I..?!

1094
00:58:21,876 --> 00:58:23,096
Why was I rejected?!

1095
00:58:23,121 --> 00:58:24,660
You have to tell me why!

1096
00:58:24,891 --> 00:58:25,842
Calm yourself.

1097
00:58:26,193 --> 00:58:27,217
Please tell me!

1098
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:29,259
What was the reason for it?!

1099
00:58:29,337 --> 00:58:30,379
Why am I out?!

1100
00:58:30,595 --> 00:58:33,812
You shouldn't just kill my chances with no good reason!

1101
00:58:34,234 --> 00:58:34,669
Come on!

1102
00:58:34,694 --> 00:58:36,385
Please! No!

1103
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:37,911
Let me stay!

1104
00:58:38,009 --> 00:58:40,335
I will never forgive you for this!

1105
00:58:40,509 --> 00:58:41,645
Never!

1106
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:46,851
His actions were thought to be an
egotistical sence of justice, gone wild.

1107
00:58:46,955 --> 00:58:49,155
So he lost his chance of becoming a judge.

1108
00:58:49,793 --> 00:58:51,975
The whole legal field was off limits to him,

1109
00:58:52,177 --> 00:58:54,630
and he lost hope for any kind of judicial life.

1110
00:58:55,019 --> 00:58:57,711
What made you hire Mr. Haba to be your clerk?

1111
00:58:59,617 --> 00:59:02,597
I believe everyone has two sides to them.

1112
00:59:03,544 --> 00:59:06,474
What you see is only one part of the person.

1113
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:13,360
Your daughter informed me,

1114
00:59:13,403 --> 00:59:16,984
that once Mr. Mori is released,
you'll no longer require my services.

1115
00:59:17,584 --> 00:59:18,582
I understand.

1116
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:20,457
Uh well, I...

1117
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,505
Guess I'll be going as well.

1118
00:59:27,571 --> 00:59:29,084
I've still got some work to do.

1119
00:59:29,337 --> 00:59:31,793
You're going to investigate the perp's Nor, right?

1120
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:35,297
Right. NAZU's agreed to cooperate with the inquiry.

1121
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,553
You mean NAZU, of the United States?

1122
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:41,451
Exactly. NAZU used the Nor software last year,

1123
00:59:41,476 --> 00:59:43,473
as part of an illegal access case.

1124
00:59:43,929 --> 00:59:46,333
Oh, the one that Miss Kyoko defended.

1125
00:59:46,765 --> 00:59:48,319
Because of that very case,

1126
00:59:48,436 --> 00:59:50,639
a protocol was developed to track the user,

1127
00:59:50,822 --> 00:59:52,577
and it was instated at NAZU.

1128
00:59:52,885 --> 00:59:55,143
We're going to have it analyzed starting tomorrow.

1129
00:59:55,459 --> 01:00:00,197
Today, they have their hands full overseeing
the critical mission of landing Hakucho safely.

1130
01:00:00,412 --> 01:00:02,858
That's the unmanned probe they launched, isnt it?

1131
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:07,839
Yes, and the MPD is panicking, because
that and the Summit are both happening today.

1132
01:00:08,308 --> 01:00:11,582
I see. The summit is starting today too...

1133
01:00:14,865 --> 01:00:18,525
The public safety division was in
charge of dealing with the explosion.

1134
01:00:18,962 --> 01:00:21,257
Put bluntly, the prosecution's police

1135
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,729
don't stand a chance against the MPD's.

1136
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:28,419
As a result, the Security Police
has influence on who is to be indicted.

1137
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:33,248
The security police use them to
collaborate on those type of cases.

1138
01:00:34,495 --> 01:00:36,370
Miss Kyoko's ringtone?

1139
01:00:36,554 --> 01:00:40,192
Why am I hearing her voice coming
from Detective Kazami's wire tap?

1140
01:00:40,406 --> 01:00:43,330
The man you keep referring to as Mr. Amuro...

1141
01:00:43,567 --> 01:00:44,886
is a murderer.

1142
01:00:45,331 --> 01:00:49,138
Haba committed suicide at the detention
center where he was being detained.

1143
01:00:52,309 --> 01:00:54,620
Oh! I know all about this one!

1144
01:00:54,763 --> 01:00:57,044
It's the NAZU illegal access case.

1145
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,521
What do you mean IoT terrorism?

1146
01:00:58,546 --> 01:01:01,260
Someone’s using the internet to blow up makeshift bombs!

1147
01:01:01,787 --> 01:01:06,991
The details of this police report...
Read like a step-by-step criminal's handbook.

1148
01:01:09,231 --> 01:01:10,201
It's nothing...

1149
01:01:10,403 --> 01:01:11,693
Seems familiar...

1150
01:01:14,038 --> 01:01:16,286
Oh no... It can't be...

1151
01:01:17,696 --> 01:01:18,696
Ms. Midori!

1152
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,288
Aah!

1153
01:01:19,517 --> 01:01:23,396
Please pull up the details of the
NAZU case! Send them to me right away!

1154
01:01:23,683 --> 01:01:24,099
Huh?

1155
01:01:24,124 --> 01:01:26,307
It's a direct order from Shinichi!

1156
01:01:28,909 --> 01:01:30,262
Conan, where are you going?

1157
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,877
We were just about to go and
pick up my Dad from MPD right now!

1158
01:01:34,864 --> 01:01:36,183
Oh geez...

1159
01:01:36,431 --> 01:01:39,057
Why aren’t you answering your phone, Shinichi?!

1160
01:02:02,797 --> 01:02:05,315
It seems like you knew I was on my way here.

1161
01:02:05,707 --> 01:02:08,754
What I knew, was that something
felt very wrong back there.

1162
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:15,674
Pardon me.

1163
01:02:15,699 --> 01:02:16,733
Oh, okay...

1164
01:02:23,376 --> 01:02:25,263
I had Doc check it out for me.

1165
01:02:25,467 --> 01:02:27,917
And he found a remote control application..

1166
01:02:28,178 --> 01:02:30,197
Which as no visible icon.

1167
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:33,097
Where’s your proof that the SP was involved?

1168
01:02:33,188 --> 01:02:35,690
There was no proof, as one might expect.

1169
01:02:35,715 --> 01:02:39,263
Then why didn’t you delete the app once
you discovered that it was on your phone?

1170
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:41,623
Because I want to confront the perp myself.

1171
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:43,529
You mean to say the terrorist?

1172
01:02:43,657 --> 01:02:45,642
Hm... And that's not all.

1173
01:02:46,125 --> 01:02:47,612
I figured out the motive.

1174
01:02:48,724 --> 01:02:50,933
It involves you and your whole team.

1175
01:02:51,552 --> 01:02:52,076
Huh?

1176
01:02:52,316 --> 01:02:55,788
It all started with the NAZU illegal access case.

1177
01:02:56,682 --> 01:02:58,298
The incident last year.

1178
01:02:59,212 --> 01:03:00,849
With Fumikazu Haba?!

1179
01:03:01,378 --> 01:03:06,078
Right, and you also knew Mr. Haba committed
suicide while at the detention center.

1180
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:09,598
Yeah... Exactly one year ago today, in fact.

1181
01:03:09,984 --> 01:03:11,019
A year ago...

1182
01:03:11,912 --> 01:03:12,682
Today?!

1183
01:03:13,405 --> 01:03:15,748
I see now... This is terrible...

1184
01:03:16,402 --> 01:03:19,307
And I bet, that his revenge hasn't ended yet!

1185
01:03:19,409 --> 01:03:19,887
Argh!

1186
01:03:27,878 --> 01:03:29,040
Woah!

1187
01:03:29,465 --> 01:03:30,325
Huh?!

1188
01:03:34,739 --> 01:03:35,247
Ah!

1189
01:03:37,527 --> 01:03:38,900
IoT attacks?!

1190
01:03:40,198 --> 01:03:40,878
Woah!

1191
01:03:48,917 --> 01:03:49,616
Ugh!

1192
01:03:57,491 --> 01:03:58,031
Hup!

1193
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:13,100
Mr. Amuro!!

1194
01:04:19,853 --> 01:04:20,703
Get going!

1195
01:04:20,850 --> 01:04:21,179
Hm.

1196
01:04:27,411 --> 01:04:31,674
The unmanned probe Hakucho, is finally
ready to make its return home from space.

1197
01:04:32,391 --> 01:04:33,494
Good evening, everyone.

1198
01:04:33,577 --> 01:04:36,429
From the National Observatory in Nagano Prefecture.

1199
01:04:37,986 --> 01:04:41,942
Oh my, it's getting very late
kids. Why don't we take you home?

1200
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:42,910
What?

1201
01:04:43,097 --> 01:04:45,732
But the Hakucho is returning. We wanted to watch!

1202
01:04:45,946 --> 01:04:48,354
Please let us stay and watch the broadcast with you!

1203
01:04:48,365 --> 01:04:48,942
Can we?

1204
01:04:49,037 --> 01:04:51,261
That’s the breaks. Just go watch it at home.

1205
01:04:51,507 --> 01:04:52,510
Aw man.

1206
01:04:52,537 --> 01:04:53,947
I was looking forward to it...

1207
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,848
Hello? Is something the matter?

1208
01:05:00,111 --> 01:05:04,411
Well, they told me they wanted to
watch the live satellite broadcast on TV.

1209
01:05:04,725 --> 01:05:07,084
Huh? The time between now and it's re-entry..?

1210
01:05:07,108 --> 01:05:07,429
Hm?

1211
01:05:08,375 --> 01:05:10,365
If I remember correctly its...

1212
01:05:10,377 --> 01:05:11,242
Kudo?

1213
01:05:12,245 --> 01:05:13,952
Just under an hour from now?!

1214
01:05:14,235 --> 01:05:15,325
We gotta hurry!

1215
01:05:15,770 --> 01:05:17,829
So it's true, the perp is...

1216
01:05:18,378 --> 01:05:21,707
Yeah. He's gonna hack into NAZU and bring the probe down!

1217
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:23,024
But where?!

1218
01:05:23,721 --> 01:05:24,415
Damn.

1219
01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:26,575
It can't be...

1220
01:05:28,423 --> 01:05:30,032
He's gonna do it from space...

1221
01:05:37,581 --> 01:05:38,629
Here he comes!

1222
01:05:38,879 --> 01:05:40,018
Mr. Mori!

1223
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:40,972
Huh?

1224
01:05:41,208 --> 01:05:42,496
Dad you're free!

1225
01:05:42,662 --> 01:05:43,958
Yes, I am.

1226
01:05:44,006 --> 01:05:45,085
Thank goodness!

1227
01:05:45,131 --> 01:05:45,579
Oh!

1228
01:05:45,963 --> 01:05:48,090
I know I worried you, I'm sorry.

1229
01:05:48,639 --> 01:05:50,689
You did, but you're back!

1230
01:05:51,106 --> 01:05:54,478
And Eri... I wanted to thank you for all your help too.

1231
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,651
Oh, you don't have to thank me?

1232
01:05:56,918 --> 01:05:59,498
I'm so happy for you, yeah.

1233
01:05:59,805 --> 01:06:02,423
I apprecaite it, thanks Sonoko!

1234
01:06:02,531 --> 01:06:07,771
Oh I almost forgot! I wanted to send a video of
this touching reunion to our other detective friend!

1235
01:06:07,977 --> 01:06:09,860
Wait Sonoko, I'm not ready!

1236
01:06:09,915 --> 01:06:11,780
Don't worry, it'll only take a second!

1237
01:06:11,805 --> 01:06:13,353
Okay, say cheese!

1238
01:06:14,216 --> 01:06:14,967
Hm?

1239
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:22,873
Quickly, turn on the emergency lights!

1240
01:06:23,018 --> 01:06:26,347
Inspector! Someone has disabled
the emergency backup power!

1241
01:06:26,372 --> 01:06:27,371
What the hell?!

1242
01:06:28,148 --> 01:06:30,334
What is going on around this place?!

1243
01:06:30,889 --> 01:06:32,852
We've got a report from NAZU!

1244
01:06:32,938 --> 01:06:36,030
They've confirmed there's been
a security breach of the probe!

1245
01:06:36,251 --> 01:06:37,578
Are they sure?!

1246
01:06:37,722 --> 01:06:41,170
And now, they may not be able to release the capsule!

1247
01:06:42,934 --> 01:06:43,850
The main unit...

1248
01:06:43,850 --> 01:06:45,337
will burn up in the atmosphere,

1249
01:06:45,373 --> 01:06:49,018
but they've determined the probe's
projected landing position is way off track!

1250
01:06:49,048 --> 01:06:50,782
NAZU's in chaos right now!

1251
01:06:51,434 --> 01:06:53,627
I'm sending you the new coordinates!

1252
01:06:54,899 --> 01:06:59,617
Latitude, 139°- 45' - 08 East in 405 seconds.

1253
01:07:00,064 --> 01:07:01,953
NAZU predicts touch down will be...

1254
01:07:03,767 --> 01:07:05,011
Can that be right?

1255
01:07:05,036 --> 01:07:05,426
Huh?

1256
01:07:06,914 --> 01:07:08,333
Uh, this isn't good.

1257
01:07:08,952 --> 01:07:09,723
Conan!

1258
01:07:12,735 --> 01:07:15,015
This whole time, he was targeting...

1259
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:18,145
the MPD!

1260
01:07:19,044 --> 01:07:20,346
It's landing where?!

1261
01:07:21,074 --> 01:07:22,396
You've gotta be kidding me!

1262
01:07:22,675 --> 01:07:26,504
A 4-meter-long capsule crashing
on us would be catastrophic!

1263
01:07:26,617 --> 01:07:28,951
The damage alone would be unimaginable!

1264
01:07:29,050 --> 01:07:32,772
Bring in the large van. Start the
process of transporting personnel.

1265
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:36,528
Evacuate everyone within a one-kilometer radius of MPD.

1266
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:37,061
Now!

1267
01:07:37,409 --> 01:07:38,318
Yes, sir!

1268
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,543
Where's the evacuation map?!

1269
01:07:41,568 --> 01:07:42,670
We don't have time!

1270
01:07:42,873 --> 01:07:44,307
What's happening?

1271
01:07:44,332 --> 01:07:46,088
Don't worry, I'm right here.

1272
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:47,700
Eri, and you too.

1273
01:07:48,382 --> 01:07:50,076
Stay real close to me.

1274
01:07:50,731 --> 01:07:52,617
Uh... Okay.

1275
01:07:53,311 --> 01:07:54,914
It's so romantic!

1276
01:07:56,528 --> 01:08:00,438
The probe’s capsule will fall with the
same speed and trajectory as a meteor would!

1277
01:08:01,089 --> 01:08:04,164
Meaning, we can only control the orbit for a short time,

1278
01:08:04,189 --> 01:08:06,037
before it re-enters our atmosphere!

1279
01:08:07,017 --> 01:08:11,885
Within one kilometer of MPD, we’ve
got ministries, parks, and hotels.

1280
01:08:12,075 --> 01:08:15,579
We estimate approximately 150,000 evacuees.

1281
01:08:17,186 --> 01:08:19,585
To find a shelter big enough for that many people,

1282
01:08:19,657 --> 01:08:23,390
we've compiled a list of sites,
one kilometer outside the target zone.

1283
01:08:27,132 --> 01:08:31,438
Prime Minister! We were informed by
NAZU that we can't reset the memory!

1284
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:32,644
Why not?!

1285
01:08:32,824 --> 01:08:35,605
The signal sent to the probe from the earth station is,

1286
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:38,603
pre-programmed with a specific security code!

1287
01:08:39,129 --> 01:08:40,930
If the code doesn't match up...

1288
01:08:41,224 --> 01:08:43,640
Then the memory won't be able to be overwritten!

1289
01:08:44,137 --> 01:08:47,360
In other words, does that mean
that the perp changed the code?!

1290
01:08:47,405 --> 01:08:50,000
That's right! When he illegally hacked into NAZU's system,

1291
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,070
and rerouted the probe's entire orbit.

1292
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:54,586
We need him to give us that changed code!

1293
01:08:54,731 --> 01:08:57,258
If I can get someone to "collaborate."

1294
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:01,045
The same someone who invents genius things like this.

1295
01:09:01,133 --> 01:09:02,446
And have him do what?!

1296
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:07,244
I want Doc to bring the dead back to life!

1297
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:15,857
What a great idea. But then
I'd expect nothing less from you!

1298
01:09:16,391 --> 01:09:18,630
I hope we can get him to tell us the code.

1299
01:09:20,164 --> 01:09:23,287
I've managed to increase it's
speed capabilities even more!

1300
01:09:26,098 --> 01:09:28,648
Doc, the image is still unsteady.

1301
01:09:29,587 --> 01:09:31,183
This isn't going to work.

1302
01:09:31,859 --> 01:09:35,545
Hm... Well it is my first attempt
at flying this thing at night.

1303
01:09:36,816 --> 01:09:37,618
Huh?

1304
01:09:37,782 --> 01:09:40,273
A night mission? I wanna do that!

1305
01:09:40,321 --> 01:09:42,568
How come only you and Doc get to do it?

1306
01:09:42,605 --> 01:09:43,982
Why are you guys here?

1307
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:47,343
The Hakucho! It's not showing on TV anymore!

1308
01:09:48,043 --> 01:09:50,903
Well in that case. Maybe you should take over?

1309
01:09:51,304 --> 01:09:53,421
I don't quite trust Doc with the controls.

1310
01:09:53,568 --> 01:09:54,476
Huh?!

1311
01:09:54,772 --> 01:09:56,249
Wow, awesome!!

1312
01:09:56,949 --> 01:09:58,386
Hehe, woah!

1313
01:09:59,078 --> 01:10:00,468
Very clever of you.

1314
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:03,050
Don't worry, they can handle it.

1315
01:10:03,527 --> 01:10:05,784
Now we can start making our preparations.

1316
01:10:06,096 --> 01:10:07,460
The three of us are!

1317
01:10:07,485 --> 01:10:08,571
The Drone...

1318
01:10:08,638 --> 01:10:10,121
Flying Squadron!

1319
01:10:10,783 --> 01:10:13,020
Let's go for it!

1320
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:17,653
Now listen up!

1321
01:10:18,009 --> 01:10:21,792
Approximately 30,000 people
are evacuating to Edge of Ocean,

1322
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:23,729
near the landfill of Tokyo Bay.

1323
01:10:23,812 --> 01:10:24,977
Do you know where that is?

1324
01:10:25,017 --> 01:10:26,160
I'm not quite sure...

1325
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:31,437
Excuse me, is that the same place where
they were supposed to hold the summit?

1326
01:10:31,647 --> 01:10:35,243
Yes that's right, in fact we're
heading straight to the Casino Tower.

1327
01:10:35,903 --> 01:10:37,246
The Casino Tower?

1328
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:39,175
Ah, it's right over there!

1329
01:10:44,766 --> 01:10:47,557
Oh yeah... I've gotta contact Shinichi!

1330
01:11:00,722 --> 01:11:02,836
NAZU keeps trying to send the code,

1331
01:11:02,987 --> 01:11:05,559
but it seems they still haven't
been able to reach the probe.

1332
01:11:06,832 --> 01:11:07,947
Damn it!

1333
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:11,669
We've gotta find a way to get that code!

1334
01:11:41,671 --> 01:11:44,538
This is the same data from NAZU’s Earth station.

1335
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,780
Isn’t that right, mister terrorist?

1336
01:11:48,919 --> 01:11:50,585
Ugh... Huh...

1337
01:11:52,197 --> 01:11:55,614
Prosecutor Kusakabe, I thought better of you.

1338
01:11:55,855 --> 01:11:57,727
What are you talking about?

1339
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,538
I should’ve known when I saw your evidence report.

1340
01:12:01,263 --> 01:12:03,885
Those shards of glass came from the cooker itself.

1341
01:12:04,935 --> 01:12:07,954
It was behind the display window of the control panel.

1342
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:10,209
Which only the bomber could’ve known.

1343
01:12:11,696 --> 01:12:15,731
You submitted that as evidence, when the
igniter was thought to be the high-pressure cable.

1344
01:12:16,056 --> 01:12:19,156
And that's when your little plan started to unravel.

1345
01:12:22,277 --> 01:12:23,692
Ah, nice timing.

1346
01:12:24,043 --> 01:12:27,998
The trial documents. These are
from last year's NAZU hacking case.

1347
01:12:28,351 --> 01:12:29,801
Which you oversaw.

1348
01:12:30,476 --> 01:12:35,268
I see. You got illegal access,
using NOR to cover your tracks.

1349
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,469
The same approach you used to pull off this act of terror.

1350
01:12:38,582 --> 01:12:41,075
Because it worked so well with the NAZU crime.

1351
01:12:41,258 --> 01:12:41,726
... Uh...

1352
01:12:42,824 --> 01:12:45,270
But you overlooked one important detail.

1353
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:49,306
NAZU already had a criminal tracking
function embedded in it's system.

1354
01:12:49,695 --> 01:12:54,048
When you found out about it, using
NOR to enter and reprogram the system,

1355
01:12:54,302 --> 01:12:58,879
you made it look like an IoT terror
attack, and your boss’s phone caught fire.

1356
01:12:59,444 --> 01:13:02,494
But it was just a decoy that distracted the police.

1357
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:07,070
That's why the odd timing of the IoT attacks stood out.

1358
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:09,755
Mind your own business!

1359
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:10,256
Damn you!

1360
01:13:10,281 --> 01:13:11,066
Hold it!

1361
01:13:24,664 --> 01:13:27,592
That phone contains evidence proving that Nor was used!

1362
01:13:27,812 --> 01:13:28,576
Oh man!

1363
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:37,277
Not getting away that easy!

1364
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:41,806
Woah... ugh!

1365
01:13:43,807 --> 01:13:45,190
Dammit, he's still on the move!

1366
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:46,550
Not a problem! Hup!

1367
01:13:58,649 --> 01:13:59,599
Damn you!

1368
01:13:59,623 --> 01:14:00,111
Hmph!

1369
01:14:00,208 --> 01:14:00,738
Ugh!

1370
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:03,287
Ugh...

1371
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:07,333
Alright, Kusakabe. What was
your motive for doing all this?

1372
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,668
Was it to punish the Security Police Force?

1373
01:14:09,924 --> 01:14:12,035
If the summit hall gets demolished,

1374
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:15,205
and the probe of the United States comes down over Tokyo,

1375
01:14:15,355 --> 01:14:18,447
The Security Police would
completely lose their reputation!

1376
01:14:18,542 --> 01:14:20,918
Why? What could you possibly have against them?

1377
01:14:21,376 --> 01:14:23,954
As long as you guys continue to be in power,

1378
01:14:24,073 --> 01:14:27,361
the prosecution division will
never be able to get anything done!

1379
01:14:27,648 --> 01:14:31,017
So you think it's okay to kill
people for the sake of justice?!

1380
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:33,840
I had no intention of killing civilians.

1381
01:14:34,361 --> 01:14:38,357
That’s why I bombed the place when only
the staff of the Security Police were there.

1382
01:14:38,611 --> 01:14:41,662
And chose IoT terror, to keep the casualties down.

1383
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:45,253
I chose that place to drop
the capsule for the same reason!

1384
01:14:47,521 --> 01:14:49,940
You blacked out MPD to give the civilians

1385
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:52,253
who were inside time to evacuate, right?

1386
01:14:52,317 --> 01:14:52,927
Yeah.

1387
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:54,041
I get it.

1388
01:14:54,622 --> 01:14:57,997
You decided to pull that IoT terror job on your way here,

1389
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,919
to scare people into staying away.

1390
01:14:59,985 --> 01:15:02,705
Even so, there was still a chance of fatalities!

1391
01:15:02,803 --> 01:15:04,114
Of innocent people!

1392
01:15:05,301 --> 01:15:08,675
If attaining justice means a
few lives lost, then so be it!

1393
01:15:08,724 --> 01:15:10,638
That's the opposite of justice!

1394
01:15:12,530 --> 01:15:13,560
Even my...

1395
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:16,118
Own collaborator died...

1396
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:19,160
In the name... of justice...

1397
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:21,044
It was Haba.

1398
01:15:22,095 --> 01:15:24,819
Wasn't it? He was your collaborator all along.

1399
01:15:24,908 --> 01:15:26,630
But... How did you know?

1400
01:15:27,288 --> 01:15:29,546
It was your passcode that gave it away.

1401
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:35,655
Once I heard it, then I knew.

1402
01:15:36,443 --> 01:15:39,746
You wanted to keep the keyboard
tones on... So you'd remember.

1403
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:41,845
Fumikazu Haba.Ha ba Fu mi kazu

1404
01:15:42,961 --> 01:15:43,881
It was to...

1405
01:15:43,961 --> 01:15:47,557
To serve as a reminder of my hatred! Fuel for my revenge!

1406
01:15:47,811 --> 01:15:50,029
Each security police collaborator,

1407
01:15:50,251 --> 01:15:53,683
gets catalogued first, then they're reported to Zero.

1408
01:15:54,271 --> 01:15:58,346
However, the officers themselves
don’t know each other’s collaborators.

1409
01:15:58,675 --> 01:16:03,675
I wasn’t even aware that police prosecutors
had collaborators. I just found out last year.

1410
01:16:03,994 --> 01:16:08,368
Oh, is that why, you just got rid of my collaborator?!

1411
01:16:08,682 --> 01:16:10,652
Wow, that seemed to hit a nerve there.

1412
01:16:10,937 --> 01:16:13,846
So what else was behind Mr. Haba's actions?

1413
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:17,573
It was... I requested that Haba do it for me.

1414
01:16:18,392 --> 01:16:21,395
I had to know more about the NAZU security breach.

1415
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:22,600
He was the best.

1416
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:26,520
When Haba found out the game
company was harboring the access data,

1417
01:16:26,623 --> 01:16:28,577
he hacked in and bypassed security.

1418
01:16:29,182 --> 01:16:31,007
He’d retrieved nearly all of it, until...

1419
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:42,815
The collaborators of the Security Police

1420
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:46,167
are willing to carry out illegal
and dangerous investigations...

1421
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:50,902
That’s why the ties between the
us became so bulletproof, so strong.

1422
01:16:51,465 --> 01:16:55,566
It’s about loyalty and trust,
far more than its about money.

1423
01:16:55,899 --> 01:16:57,941
We’re connected by a sense of mission.

1424
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:00,205
At our core, we’re the same.

1425
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:04,353
Why didn't you say you were my
collaborator, during the interrogation?!

1426
01:17:04,655 --> 01:17:09,518
Your whole identity is wrapped up in being a
security police officer. I didn't want to ruin it for you.

1427
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:12,878
You should be thinking about
yourself right now! Not about me!

1428
01:17:12,903 --> 01:17:15,047
That's why I was worried about you!

1429
01:17:15,374 --> 01:17:17,757
I know too well how injustice feels...

1430
01:17:18,148 --> 01:17:18,686
Ugh...

1431
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:22,808
Please! Think about what you're doing here!

1432
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,628
This is much bigger than me.

1433
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:28,418
I’d rather be a person who
saves many lives. Not only my own.

1434
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:29,243
Ah....

1435
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:34,457
The aspiration you've always talked
about, is no different than mine.

1436
01:17:35,744 --> 01:17:40,836
After that, I told the prosecutor
in charge of his case everything.

1437
01:17:41,399 --> 01:17:43,235
Haba is my collaborator.

1438
01:17:43,536 --> 01:17:46,115
He had a very good reason for committing the crime.

1439
01:17:46,155 --> 01:17:48,105
I don't care, I'm still indicting him.

1440
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:48,764
What?!

1441
01:17:50,236 --> 01:17:53,190
Not again... Because of the security police?

1442
01:17:53,388 --> 01:17:54,610
Oh relax.

1443
01:17:54,977 --> 01:17:57,120
I'll make sure that your name never gets mentioned,

1444
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,737
and that the trial will go exactly as we want it to.

1445
01:18:00,118 --> 01:18:02,318
That is not what I am talking about!

1446
01:18:03,757 --> 01:18:06,292
I decided to go directly to the MPD.

1447
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,309
But before I could get there...

1448
01:18:12,518 --> 01:18:13,147
Yes?

1449
01:18:14,174 --> 01:18:15,856
Haba committed suicide.

1450
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:18,622
What?

1451
01:18:18,765 --> 01:18:20,282
We can't be sure why,

1452
01:18:20,356 --> 01:18:22,594
but apparently it happened in the detention center.

1453
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:25,447
Right after the JPA's "special" interrogation.

1454
01:18:48,143 --> 01:18:50,170
The ones who forced him into suicide...

1455
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:54,374
No, who murdered him! Are the Security Police!!

1456
01:18:55,193 --> 01:18:58,189
That’s why you diverted the probe to drop on the MPD?

1457
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:03,703
That’s right. Since the date of Hachuko’s
return was the same one as Haba’s death.

1458
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,283
And the IoT attacks?

1459
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:06,832
It wasn't part of the plan...

1460
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:11,488
But as a prosecutor, I couldn't very
well indict an innocent person, could I?

1461
01:19:12,219 --> 01:19:16,405
So to prove Kogoro Mori wasn’t guilty,
you decide terrorism was the way to go?

1462
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:17,247
Hm...

1463
01:19:17,804 --> 01:19:21,291
But we didn't plan it out... So there
were more casualties than expected.

1464
01:19:21,831 --> 01:19:24,732
This madness has got to end right here and now.

1465
01:19:25,335 --> 01:19:27,948
Give us the new code you used when you hacked the system!

1466
01:19:29,061 --> 01:19:31,961
The Security Police carry out their own brand of justice!

1467
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:35,013
Why should people like Haba have to suffer because of it?!

1468
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:36,886
Quit stalling! Tell us the code!

1469
01:19:36,911 --> 01:19:39,072
Go ahead, arrest me! I don't care!

1470
01:19:39,197 --> 01:19:41,621
You're not getting any information out of me.

1471
01:19:41,963 --> 01:19:43,059
Mr. Kusakabe.

1472
01:19:43,084 --> 01:19:43,401
Huh?

1473
01:19:46,805 --> 01:19:47,986
Mr. Kusakabe!

1474
01:19:50,311 --> 01:19:51,514
It can't be!

1475
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:53,166
How can Haba be alive?

1476
01:19:55,701 --> 01:19:58,402
It’s coming live from the MPD heliport.

1477
01:19:58,854 --> 01:20:00,324
What's going on here?

1478
01:20:01,119 --> 01:20:03,932
It was a security police setup from the beginning.

1479
01:20:04,305 --> 01:20:06,356
They framed his death as suicide,

1480
01:20:06,681 --> 01:20:08,689
and promised to keep it a secret.

1481
01:20:09,286 --> 01:20:13,997
The did this to carefully cover up any evidence
they’d had a collaborator working with them.

1482
01:20:14,650 --> 01:20:19,275
What’s more, to ensure the security
police never solicit collaborators again,

1483
01:20:19,726 --> 01:20:21,887
that info was hidden from even you.

1484
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:26,328
Wrapping up all your illegal work, without extra help...

1485
01:20:26,803 --> 01:20:28,943
isn't something you're capable of.

1486
01:20:29,965 --> 01:20:32,948
That is the assesment passed by the security police.

1487
01:20:34,179 --> 01:20:35,005
You see...

1488
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:38,691
Haba felt strongly that it was his destiny to be a judge.

1489
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:41,058
He had a very deep sense of purpose.

1490
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:46,873
That’s why when he was dismissed from
law school, and had nowhere else to go

1491
01:20:47,039 --> 01:20:48,670
he became your collaborator.

1492
01:20:48,902 --> 01:20:49,956
Exactly.

1493
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:54,858
Kusakabe was the one who saved
me from the abyss of hopelessness.

1494
01:20:55,907 --> 01:20:57,957
I'd only known him for two years,

1495
01:20:58,005 --> 01:21:03,940
but he told me, “Thanks to you, I’ve been able to
do my work as the prosecution of the security police."

1496
01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:04,456
Ugh...

1497
01:21:05,330 --> 01:21:07,499
That's the only reason why I'm still here.

1498
01:21:07,719 --> 01:21:12,521
Please... Mr. Kusakabe, you have
to tell us what the new code is!

1499
01:21:13,715 --> 01:21:17,351
If you don’t, there’s a good chance
that Haba will be killed in the process.

1500
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:19,678
How dare you!

1501
01:21:19,753 --> 01:21:22,413
Is this this the way the security police does things?!

1502
01:21:22,706 --> 01:21:25,454
Its getting closer! Coming through the atmosphere!

1503
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,530
Why don’t we have the code yet?!

1504
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:31,030
We’d better get it soon, or we
won’t be able to access the probe!

1505
01:21:31,176 --> 01:21:33,694
Mr. Furuya, we're out of time!

1506
01:21:34,591 --> 01:21:36,379
Please, we need that code now!

1507
01:21:36,404 --> 01:21:38,708
Stop wasting time! Tell us the code!

1508
01:21:40,704 --> 01:21:41,599
But if I...

1509
01:21:52,526 --> 01:21:53,890
Mr. Kusakabe

1510
01:21:54,964 --> 01:21:59,239
Is this the type of justice
that we were fighting together for?

1511
01:22:03,742 --> 01:22:06,291
When I broke into the NAZU mainframe,

1512
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:08,556
I reprogrammed the code to be...

1513
01:22:31,338 --> 01:22:33,124
A black out?! Are you kidding?!

1514
01:22:33,441 --> 01:22:38,119
No sir! Only for about five minutes,
it has to be done for the re-entry!

1515
01:22:38,855 --> 01:22:41,695
Yeah but during that time, plasma will be emitted!

1516
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:43,540
Our communications will be disrupted,

1517
01:22:43,641 --> 01:22:46,613
and it's questionable whether
we'll be able to revise the orbit!

1518
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:50,466
And, there's a chance the parachute won't deploy!

1519
01:22:50,570 --> 01:22:51,585
Aw damn!

1520
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:53,595
Haba, no...

1521
01:22:53,925 --> 01:22:55,251
Evacuate him!

1522
01:22:55,423 --> 01:22:57,307
Get him out of there now!

1523
01:22:57,992 --> 01:22:59,252
Wait, come back!

1524
01:23:03,870 --> 01:23:05,952
Did you hear back from Shinichi yet?

1525
01:23:06,042 --> 01:23:07,372
I'm still waiting.

1526
01:23:07,813 --> 01:23:09,367
But I left him a voicemail?

1527
01:23:09,635 --> 01:23:11,940
Jeez, what the hell is he doing?

1528
01:23:12,502 --> 01:23:15,293
Conan's not answering either, his phone must be off.

1529
01:23:15,731 --> 01:23:18,988
Oh, don't worry about that
little brat, I'm sure he's fine.

1530
01:23:19,624 --> 01:23:22,811
Amazing! Look how tall it is.

1531
01:23:23,572 --> 01:23:25,735
Come on, this way. Let's go!

1532
01:23:30,522 --> 01:23:32,066
Haba! Where are you?!

1533
01:23:36,092 --> 01:23:37,247
What is going on..?

1534
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:38,856
Huh?

1535
01:23:39,169 --> 01:23:40,726
You're not gonna find him here.

1536
01:23:41,203 --> 01:23:44,120
No I saw him... He was streaming from his phone!

1537
01:23:44,532 --> 01:23:47,452
You saw a composite image. He's somewhere else.

1538
01:23:47,645 --> 01:23:48,322
But he...

1539
01:23:49,434 --> 01:23:51,880
The image was captured by a high-powered drone.

1540
01:23:52,469 --> 01:23:56,578
We superimposed Haba over a digital
background of the MPD heliport.

1541
01:23:57,245 --> 01:23:58,562
He's in a safe place.

1542
01:24:01,657 --> 01:24:03,113
Oh, thank goodness...

1543
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:06,675
Mr. Amuro, if they haven't rerouted the probe yet...

1544
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:09,460
Then it's going to end up colliding with...

1545
01:24:09,551 --> 01:24:12,788
Of course... A capsule more than 4 meters wide,

1546
01:24:13,206 --> 01:24:16,796
will crash down on us at over 10 kilometers per second.

1547
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:21,452
I have an idea. Can you get a hold of
some explosives right now, Mr. Amuro?

1548
01:24:21,532 --> 01:24:24,073
Are you thinking of trying to destroy the capsule?

1549
01:24:24,618 --> 01:24:25,248
No.

1550
01:24:25,864 --> 01:24:29,404
I just need enough blast power to
divert it over the Pacific Ocean.

1551
01:24:31,652 --> 01:24:33,773
I like the way your brain works, kid.

1552
01:24:34,298 --> 01:24:35,927
You got any better ideas?

1553
01:24:37,389 --> 01:24:39,899
Hey Kazami, this is top priority.

1554
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:44,658
That's right, it looks like we may
have to bend the rules a little again.

1555
01:24:51,563 --> 01:24:56,354
Of all the munitions we’ve confiscated,
these are easily the most powerful.

1556
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:58,465
You sure they can't track this?

1557
01:24:58,585 --> 01:25:00,175
The disposal date is coming up.

1558
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:02,741
We just have to revise the records, no one will know.

1559
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:03,661
Great.

1560
01:25:03,773 --> 01:25:04,913
It's up to you now.

1561
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:12,084
Alright, no problem.

1562
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:16,010
I'll send you the probe's projected
course data as soon as possible.

1563
01:25:16,328 --> 01:25:17,264
Hmm...

1564
01:25:17,908 --> 01:25:19,196
Okay everybody!

1565
01:25:19,426 --> 01:25:20,928
It's time for take off!

1566
01:25:21,055 --> 01:25:21,611
Alright!

1567
01:25:21,636 --> 01:25:22,452
Awesome!

1568
01:25:23,629 --> 01:25:26,202
Recalibrate to a new blast site he says.

1569
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:27,535
Now, he says!

1570
01:25:28,004 --> 01:25:31,115
Jeez... How am I supposed to do all that!?

1571
01:25:31,330 --> 01:25:32,344
Ugh!!

1572
01:25:34,617 --> 01:25:36,953
Mitsuhiko... Ayumi...

1573
01:25:37,374 --> 01:25:38,135
Genta...

1574
01:25:38,704 --> 01:25:39,828
And Ai...

1575
01:25:41,189 --> 01:25:44,215
The fate of the country rests in your hands!

1576
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:52,334
Huh? The drone's not flying right!

1577
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:54,630
Maybe don't put too much stuff in it?

1578
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:56,592
We should just leave it somewhere!

1579
01:25:56,792 --> 01:25:58,054
D-Don't you dare!

1580
01:25:58,275 --> 01:26:02,296
Those are all my possessions! Please!
They’re cherished and precious to me!

1581
01:26:03,102 --> 01:26:06,721
Should be okay now, I was able
to narrow down the differential.

1582
01:26:07,739 --> 01:26:09,551
I'll send you the image from the drone,

1583
01:26:09,576 --> 01:26:11,545
so you adjust the timing on your side.

1584
01:26:11,869 --> 01:26:13,411
I got it. Thank you.

1585
01:26:14,437 --> 01:26:16,064
I'm not sure but...

1586
01:26:16,420 --> 01:26:20,483
Are we allowed to take any pictures of
the Hakucho when we’re this close to it?

1587
01:26:21,278 --> 01:26:24,423
It's okay. We got permission from the police.

1588
01:26:26,473 --> 01:26:28,587
From the Security Police, that is.

1589
01:26:49,873 --> 01:26:50,546
What?!

1590
01:26:51,242 --> 01:26:52,810
The parachute's not working?!

1591
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:56,220
No, it appears that the heat
shield is still completely locked!

1592
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:59,009
Prime Minister! Issue the order to destroy it!

1593
01:26:59,034 --> 01:27:00,493
No! Wait a second!

1594
01:27:01,033 --> 01:27:01,858
What is it?

1595
01:27:02,215 --> 01:27:05,854
A strike at this altitude would
only put more lives in danger!

1596
01:27:12,354 --> 01:27:15,009
It’s already gone below 30,000 meters.

1597
01:27:15,188 --> 01:27:15,962
I got it.

1598
01:27:16,622 --> 01:27:18,124
Yes, I understand.

1599
01:27:18,827 --> 01:27:20,236
Don't screw this up.

1600
01:27:23,574 --> 01:27:24,376
Copy that.

1601
01:27:25,274 --> 01:27:26,409
Mr. Amuro!

1602
01:27:27,268 --> 01:27:28,920
Will this help you with the timing?

1603
01:27:29,284 --> 01:27:30,204
It will.

1604
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:33,281
Hm...

1605
01:27:35,109 --> 01:27:36,936
I'm closing in on the capsule!

1606
01:27:37,435 --> 01:27:40,807
You can do it guys... You have to!

1607
01:27:44,495 --> 01:27:47,687
It's gonna crash if it keeps swerving like this!

1608
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:49,259
Don't worry about it!

1609
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:52,913
It has sensors! If it should fly too close to something,

1610
01:27:52,991 --> 01:27:56,036
then it will automatically correct its course to avoid it!

1611
01:27:56,250 --> 01:28:00,454
Come on you guys! Don't you want to get a
closer look, and watch the capsule in real time?

1612
01:28:00,621 --> 01:28:02,732
I do! I wanna see it!

1613
01:28:02,859 --> 01:28:04,432
Yeah, go for it!

1614
01:28:04,696 --> 01:28:06,141
Alright, we can do this!

1615
01:28:09,107 --> 01:28:12,116
Okay Kudo... Don't get reckless now.

1616
01:28:37,753 --> 01:28:38,891
Almost there!

1617
01:28:40,457 --> 01:28:42,926
And, go!

1618
01:29:10,248 --> 01:29:11,647
Look sir, the parachute!

1619
01:29:12,066 --> 01:29:13,004
It's opened up!

1620
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:18,640
What just...

1621
01:29:18,764 --> 01:29:21,340
What happened? The screen went dark all of a sudden!

1622
01:29:21,549 --> 01:29:24,056
Aw, please tell me that it didn't crash...

1623
01:29:24,324 --> 01:29:27,123
You said that it has course
correction built into it right?

1624
01:29:27,272 --> 01:29:29,556
Uh well, yes! It does.

1625
01:29:29,735 --> 01:29:31,407
I bet the battery died!

1626
01:29:32,195 --> 01:29:34,855
Actually, it's not even equipped with that system.

1627
01:29:35,792 --> 01:29:37,954
It's okay, it all worked out.

1628
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:39,781
Amazing...

1629
01:29:39,984 --> 01:29:40,488
Huh?

1630
01:29:41,028 --> 01:29:43,658
Forgive me but... Who are you?

1631
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:46,650
I guess I'd describe us as...

1632
01:29:46,764 --> 01:29:48,861
collaborators for a small detective.

1633
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:50,117
Huh?

1634
01:29:51,538 --> 01:29:53,381
Yeah. Roger that.

1635
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:55,114
We did it.

1636
01:29:55,488 --> 01:29:56,471
That's great!

1637
01:29:57,274 --> 01:29:58,220
Mr. Furuya.

1638
01:29:58,922 --> 01:30:00,476
We'll take it from here.

1639
01:30:01,303 --> 01:30:02,081
Alright.

1640
01:30:02,503 --> 01:30:03,121
Wait!

1641
01:30:06,371 --> 01:30:07,499
Always remember...

1642
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:11,163
Mr. Kusakabe... We're still one and the same.

1643
01:30:13,210 --> 01:30:13,888
I know.

1644
01:30:14,923 --> 01:30:15,937
Alright, let's go.

1645
01:30:17,748 --> 01:30:18,703
Fumikazu!

1646
01:30:19,159 --> 01:30:20,029
Miss Kyoko!

1647
01:30:22,423 --> 01:30:23,367
So it's true...

1648
01:30:23,891 --> 01:30:26,663
You're alive... I still can't believe it.

1649
01:30:27,455 --> 01:30:28,505
Neither can I...

1650
01:30:29,015 --> 01:30:30,652
You're terrifying Amuro...

1651
01:30:31,743 --> 01:30:34,148
I never thought you were a collaborator...

1652
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:37,604
Much less... For the Security Police!

1653
01:30:42,141 --> 01:30:43,212
Miss Kyoko.

1654
01:30:43,466 --> 01:30:43,974
Hm?

1655
01:30:44,307 --> 01:30:46,534
You were clearly a collaborator as well.

1656
01:30:46,855 --> 01:30:48,979
Working for Detective Kazami, right?

1657
01:30:49,735 --> 01:30:51,697
You once asked why it was,

1658
01:30:51,951 --> 01:30:54,360
that I chose to hire Fumikazu...

1659
01:30:56,018 --> 01:30:58,857
You see, he was a disgruntled former law student,

1660
01:30:58,991 --> 01:31:02,289
and considered a dangerous entity by the Security Police.

1661
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:08,525
That’s why they asked me to hire him,
they wanted to be able to monitor his actions.

1662
01:31:11,019 --> 01:31:13,371
But after only a short time working together...

1663
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:16,709
I started to develop... feelings for him.

1664
01:31:17,743 --> 01:31:19,300
And it was mutual for me...

1665
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:25,624
That's the reason, the situation
was even more difficult and painful..

1666
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:30,097
To think you were a collaborator, just like I was...

1667
01:31:33,816 --> 01:31:38,137
It all started with the illegal access
of the NAZU computer systems didn’t it?

1668
01:31:38,330 --> 01:31:39,026
Yes.

1669
01:31:40,314 --> 01:31:44,899
The security police instructed me to rig
the investigation to implicate the suspect.

1670
01:31:46,431 --> 01:31:49,680
Around the same time, Haba was caught stealing info,

1671
01:31:49,815 --> 01:31:52,254
at the game company that the suspect frequented.

1672
01:31:53,383 --> 01:31:57,028
I’ll never understand why he took a crazy risk like that.

1673
01:31:59,573 --> 01:32:03,433
Then, I was desperate. I begged
the security police to help him.

1674
01:32:04,155 --> 01:32:05,895
They said he killed himself.

1675
01:32:06,913 --> 01:32:08,835
I never trusted them after that.

1676
01:32:09,036 --> 01:32:10,584
I shut down my law office,

1677
01:32:10,656 --> 01:32:14,500
and became a collaborator, waiting
for the right time to retaliate.

1678
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:15,786
And that's when...

1679
01:32:16,287 --> 01:32:19,194
you were ordered to take on Pops' pending court case.

1680
01:32:19,244 --> 01:32:21,308
To make sure he was found innocent.

1681
01:32:21,766 --> 01:32:22,452
Yes.

1682
01:32:23,526 --> 01:32:27,840
Although I didn’t know why they were so
hell bent on getting that particular verdict...

1683
01:32:28,339 --> 01:32:30,853
But I was set on making him guilty.

1684
01:32:31,590 --> 01:32:33,891
Even if you got innocent people in trouble?

1685
01:32:34,126 --> 01:32:35,921
I wasn't given a choice!

1686
01:32:36,477 --> 01:32:41,140
You see, if I knew that this entire time he was alive,

1687
01:32:41,220 --> 01:32:43,324
under Security Police protection?

1688
01:32:43,733 --> 01:32:45,701
This would have never happened.

1689
01:32:50,548 --> 01:32:52,199
So I suppose now...

1690
01:32:52,696 --> 01:32:55,416
Fumikazu's a collaborator for you, isn't he?

1691
01:32:56,894 --> 01:32:58,570
What number does he have?

1692
01:32:59,350 --> 01:33:00,183
Number?

1693
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:05,737
The SPD assign us a reference
number to identify us anonymously.

1694
01:33:06,978 --> 01:33:09,726
My number is 2291.

1695
01:33:10,671 --> 01:33:13,019
So what number have you given to him?!

1696
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:15,493
Ms. Tachibana.

1697
01:33:16,570 --> 01:33:19,816
You are hereby released from
your duties as a collaborator.

1698
01:33:20,386 --> 01:33:21,451
Hear that, Kazami?

1699
01:33:21,948 --> 01:33:25,527
Yes, loud and clear. This is our mess, we’ll clean it up.

1700
01:33:26,176 --> 01:33:27,933
We keep our word after all.

1701
01:33:29,699 --> 01:33:31,350
You can find Haba here.

1702
01:33:31,699 --> 01:33:33,694
You're free to go to him at any time.

1703
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,626
If you want to see him, we won't interfere with...

1704
01:33:37,231 --> 01:33:38,661
I've had enough of this!

1705
01:33:38,686 --> 01:33:39,409
Huh...

1706
01:33:45,548 --> 01:33:48,777
I cooperated with your scheme of my own volition!

1707
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:51,833
Exactly the same way I chose to betray you!

1708
01:33:52,059 --> 01:33:54,446
And nobody made me fall in love with him!

1709
01:33:55,003 --> 01:33:57,175
If you think you controlled me...

1710
01:33:57,766 --> 01:34:00,964
Then you’re even dumber and more deluded than I thought!

1711
01:34:10,071 --> 01:34:10,885
Goodbye...

1712
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:15,446
Kyoko...

1713
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:22,367
She may despise you,

1714
01:34:22,830 --> 01:34:24,352
but you've still gotta protect her.

1715
01:34:25,053 --> 01:34:25,820
To the end.

1716
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,220
That's what we Security Police are about.

1717
01:34:31,294 --> 01:34:32,823
We really owe you.

1718
01:34:32,936 --> 01:34:36,116
Thanks to all your help, we could
finally bring the terrorist down.

1719
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:38,422
When did you know it was the work of a terrorist?

1720
01:34:38,570 --> 01:34:40,519
It's exactly as you deduced.

1721
01:34:42,427 --> 01:34:45,938
That day, while we were inspecting
the international conference hall

1722
01:34:46,137 --> 01:34:50,045
We saw it was possible that someone
could access the gas valve via the Internet.

1723
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:53,723
We considered the possibility
of a potential terror attack,

1724
01:34:53,768 --> 01:34:57,491
and gave instructions out to the
forensics department of the security police.

1725
01:35:00,890 --> 01:35:03,020
But upon examining the aftermath,

1726
01:35:03,092 --> 01:35:05,825
it could have also been
considered an accidental explosion.

1727
01:35:05,977 --> 01:35:08,621
That’s why you had to set someone up as a suspect.

1728
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:11,700
Yeah, we wanted to move him ASAP,

1729
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:15,461
over from MPD security police, to
the prosecution’s police department,

1730
01:35:15,486 --> 01:35:17,240
where they had no choice but to listen.

1731
01:35:17,476 --> 01:35:22,096
Oh, then that’s why, in order to rule out
the chance of the explosion being accidental,

1732
01:35:22,292 --> 01:35:25,893
you sent Kyoko in to defend
Pops and get the charges dropped.

1733
01:35:26,282 --> 01:35:30,199
You’re pretty amazing at this
kid. You sure can solve a mystery.

1734
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:33,813
Actually, there’s one more
thing that I haven’t solved yet .

1735
01:35:34,130 --> 01:35:35,067
And that is...

1736
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:35,919
Your cellphone.

1737
01:35:35,978 --> 01:35:36,331
Huh?

1738
01:35:36,710 --> 01:35:38,915
Looks like someone’s trying to get a hold of you.

1739
01:35:39,447 --> 01:35:39,986
Huh...

1740
01:35:44,548 --> 01:35:45,476
Hey Shinichi?

1741
01:35:45,712 --> 01:35:49,244
I’m at the casino tower at the Edge
of Ocean, we've been evacuated here.

1742
01:35:49,631 --> 01:35:50,043
Yes?

1743
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:51,659
Call me when you get this message.

1744
01:35:52,608 --> 01:35:54,741
What? The capsule?!

1745
01:35:57,586 --> 01:35:59,546
An explosion’s thrown the capsule off,

1746
01:35:59,610 --> 01:36:03,291
and now it looks like it’s going to
crash onto the landfill at Tokyo Bay!

1747
01:36:03,388 --> 01:36:08,796
That’s exactly where Edge of Ocean is! 30,000
people are currently evacuating there for safety!

1748
01:36:08,861 --> 01:36:11,004
We can't intercept at this point!

1749
01:36:11,927 --> 01:36:13,477
You have plenty of time!

1750
01:36:14,418 --> 01:36:16,589
Please! Stay calm everyone!

1751
01:36:17,155 --> 01:36:20,641
We guarantee that everyone will get a seat on the busses!

1752
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:21,886
Inspector.

1753
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:22,477
Hm?

1754
01:36:22,564 --> 01:36:26,830
There's been a bit of confusion. People are
trying to drive their own cars out of here!

1755
01:36:27,083 --> 01:36:27,798
What?!

1756
01:36:27,946 --> 01:36:30,436
The only two bridges are totally grid locked.

1757
01:36:36,684 --> 01:36:37,882
That's not good.

1758
01:36:38,109 --> 01:36:39,820
It's complete chaos.

1759
01:36:40,990 --> 01:36:42,362
Shinichi...

1760
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:46,955
Aw, come on! I can't get a hold of Ran!

1761
01:36:47,321 --> 01:36:49,561
What do we do? We're running out of time!

1762
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:53,676
Mr. Amuro, looks like you’ll have
to be my collaborator on this one!

1763
01:36:54,225 --> 01:36:54,789
Huh?

1764
01:36:55,661 --> 01:36:56,321
Hmph.

1765
01:37:06,397 --> 01:37:08,104
Bad traffic jam up ahead!

1766
01:37:09,065 --> 01:37:11,442
Their evacuation plan's not working!

1767
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:36,184
Hm.

1768
01:37:36,434 --> 01:37:37,138
Hmph...

1769
01:37:45,243 --> 01:37:45,820
Huh?!

1770
01:37:56,147 --> 01:37:56,877
Gah!

1771
01:38:15,764 --> 01:38:17,337
There's the Casino Tower...

1772
01:38:17,739 --> 01:38:18,485
Mr. Furuya!

1773
01:38:18,509 --> 01:38:18,845
Huh?

1774
01:38:19,991 --> 01:38:23,114
The capsule's parachute has
detached, and the probe is accelerating!

1775
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:23,995
And?

1776
01:38:24,788 --> 01:38:26,816
NAZU has predicted the point of landing!

1777
01:38:27,688 --> 01:38:31,622
They say at this rate, it's gonna crash
into the Casino Tower in five minutes!

1778
01:38:32,550 --> 01:38:34,164
That's where Ran is!

1779
01:38:34,340 --> 01:38:36,932
No! What now? Come on!

1780
01:38:37,168 --> 01:38:37,709
Huh?

1781
01:38:40,266 --> 01:38:41,495
Mr. Amuro!

1782
01:38:41,946 --> 01:38:42,468
Huh?!

1783
01:38:42,493 --> 01:38:44,746
Alright, keep yourself strapped in!

1784
01:38:49,811 --> 01:38:51,223
What do we do now?!

1785
01:38:55,230 --> 01:38:55,951
Huh?!

1786
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:15,319
Hang on!

1787
01:39:20,559 --> 01:39:21,237
Woah!

1788
01:39:31,313 --> 01:39:33,235
I thought we were finished for sure...

1789
01:39:33,791 --> 01:39:35,324
This guy's amazing...

1790
01:39:35,918 --> 01:39:37,594
Alright, so what now?

1791
01:39:37,669 --> 01:39:39,343
Ah! Wait a sec.

1792
01:39:43,049 --> 01:39:44,952
Head for this building under construction!

1793
01:39:47,391 --> 01:39:48,973
Huh? I got it!

1794
01:39:57,601 --> 01:39:59,413
Okay, stay close to me.

1795
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:00,198
Right.

1796
01:40:00,955 --> 01:40:02,748
Things look pretty bad...

1797
01:40:14,271 --> 01:40:15,216
Are we gonna make it?

1798
01:40:15,700 --> 01:40:17,408
Factoring in the building's height...

1799
01:40:17,715 --> 01:40:20,038
and the remaining distance to get to the tower...

1800
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:22,659
We should wait 60 seconds, then floor it!

1801
01:40:25,278 --> 01:40:26,577
It's do or die time.

1802
01:40:27,885 --> 01:40:30,645
Please make it in time!

1803
01:40:31,050 --> 01:40:31,994
Ran!

1804
01:40:35,444 --> 01:40:36,277
What is it?

1805
01:40:36,350 --> 01:40:38,204
Don't worry, she's gonna be okay.

1806
01:40:38,513 --> 01:40:39,462
Ah...

1807
01:40:50,063 --> 01:40:51,891
I hope you don't mind if I ask,

1808
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:54,361
but do you have a girlfriend, Mr. Amuro?

1809
01:40:54,541 --> 01:40:56,194
Uh... Hm.

1810
01:41:01,257 --> 01:41:02,178
Actually,

1811
01:41:02,677 --> 01:41:03,869
yes I do.

1812
01:41:04,921 --> 01:41:05,450
Heh.

1813
01:41:05,966 --> 01:41:07,317
It's my country.

1814
01:41:08,033 --> 01:41:08,772
Huh...

1815
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:14,144
We're just about there!

1816
01:41:14,414 --> 01:41:16,996
Can you move it? Anything will help!

1817
01:41:17,145 --> 01:41:18,743
Just a few more seconds.

1818
01:41:20,626 --> 01:41:21,310
Five!

1819
01:41:21,620 --> 01:41:22,207
Four!

1820
01:41:22,533 --> 01:41:23,144
Three!

1821
01:41:23,663 --> 01:41:24,272
Two!

1822
01:41:24,536 --> 01:41:25,235
One!

1823
01:41:25,904 --> 01:41:26,633
Zero!

1824
01:41:33,682 --> 01:41:35,873
No good! There's not enough clearance!

1825
01:41:35,912 --> 01:41:37,302
That's just great!

1826
01:41:43,143 --> 01:41:43,621
Ugh!

1827
01:42:07,979 --> 01:42:08,384
Argh!

1828
01:42:11,236 --> 01:42:12,371
Now!

1829
01:42:12,609 --> 01:42:17,400
Go!

1830
01:42:19,928 --> 01:42:20,848
Woah!

1831
01:42:30,333 --> 01:42:31,311
Ran!

1832
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:32,560
Mom! Dad!

1833
01:42:33,905 --> 01:42:34,902
Ran!

1834
01:43:08,597 --> 01:43:10,018
Woah! Ah!

1835
01:43:34,569 --> 01:43:35,870
We'll take it from here.

1836
01:43:36,133 --> 01:43:38,117
Now get yourself to some place safe.

1837
01:43:38,570 --> 01:43:40,400
The mystery hasn't been solved yet.

1838
01:43:41,424 --> 01:43:43,880
Why did you get Pops involved in all of this?

1839
01:43:44,888 --> 01:43:45,365
Heh...

1840
01:43:46,152 --> 01:43:47,446
Because of my position,

1841
01:43:47,961 --> 01:43:49,876
I can't do an open investigation.

1842
01:43:50,743 --> 01:43:52,420
So I figured if I got him involved,

1843
01:43:52,420 --> 01:43:54,453
you would show up and become my collaborator.

1844
01:43:55,271 --> 01:43:55,580
Huh?

1845
01:43:56,702 --> 01:44:01,262
With you on the case, we’d be able
to make some progress and get it solved.

1846
01:44:01,867 --> 01:44:02,357
Huh...

1847
01:44:04,922 --> 01:44:06,842
You're giving me too much credit.

1848
01:48:27,950 --> 01:48:32,526
Acting on a personal grudge against the
police for what he considered blatant corruption,

1849
01:48:32,860 --> 01:48:36,895
Makoto Kusakabe, a former
prosecutor, has now been identified

1850
01:48:37,141 --> 01:48:40,391
as the culprit behind the series of terror attacks.

1851
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,529
The security police were cleared of their involvement.

1852
01:48:43,742 --> 01:48:46,667
That was probably what they had
decided upon from the beginning.

1853
01:48:48,433 --> 01:48:50,641
From inside the capsule of the probe Hakucho,

1854
01:48:50,666 --> 01:48:53,314
that was safely retrieved after landing in Tokyo Bay,

1855
01:48:53,338 --> 01:48:53,731
Neat!

1856
01:48:53,755 --> 01:48:58,362
they collected a sample substance exclusive to
Mars. This could be a groundbreaking new step,

1857
01:48:58,387 --> 01:49:00,540
in revealing the mysteries of space.

1858
01:49:00,817 --> 01:49:01,944
Hakucho’s launch was a joint venture,

1859
01:49:01,968 --> 01:49:02,947
- How cool!

1860
01:49:03,140 --> 01:49:05,362
I was hoping we could have watched it with the drone.

1861
01:49:05,482 --> 01:49:08,857
Yeah. We could’ve, if it wasn’t
loaded up with all Doc’s things!

1862
01:49:08,966 --> 01:49:10,375
Oh right, hehe...

1863
01:49:10,778 --> 01:49:15,048
You know something? I don’t think they’re
even aware of what they accomplished here today.

1864
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:17,266
How they were part of retrieving the capsule.

1865
01:49:17,510 --> 01:49:21,458
Yeah. What’s more, they saved Japan from catastrophe.

1866
01:49:21,581 --> 01:49:23,603
Those guys really are amazing.

1867
01:49:24,463 --> 01:49:28,967
Yeah! Now let’s go take out Doc’s
drone! We can check out Mars with it!

1868
01:49:28,992 --> 01:49:30,459
That's a great idea!

1869
01:49:30,484 --> 01:49:31,564
Yeah, it is!

1870
01:49:31,905 --> 01:49:34,344
Doc, make us a new one! Please?

1871
01:49:34,380 --> 01:49:36,474
How about you make it bigger this time!

1872
01:49:36,628 --> 01:49:40,088
Haha! How could I ever say no to you guys?

1873
01:49:40,177 --> 01:49:41,757
Alright!

1874
01:49:45,751 --> 01:49:48,518
Yeah... Like that could happen.

1875
01:50:00,748 --> 01:50:02,003
We will meet again,

1876
01:50:03,011 --> 01:50:04,703
on the ship that floats.

1877
01:50:04,969 --> 01:50:06,529
Upon the night sky.
