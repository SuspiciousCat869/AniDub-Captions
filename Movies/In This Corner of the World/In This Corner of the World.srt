171
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,103
Mizuhara, what did you mean earlier?

172
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:44,170
Huh?

173
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:50,076
Oh. The white waves look like rabbits hopping.

174
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:54,080
Hey, Mizuhara, can I give my brother to you?

175
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:54,447
No, thanks.

176
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:59,051
Everyone says, \"Run when you see Urano's brother.\"

177
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:05,124
But at least he's better than the idiot

178
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:08,394
who joined the navy and drowned.

179
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:13,899
You're right, they do look like white rabbits.

180
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,069
I'm done.

181
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,771
Here, I collected them for you.

182
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,306
Thanks.

183
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,276
This isn't what I wanted, you know.

184
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,413
Now this means that I have to go back home.

185
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:31,917
And with a drawing like this, I can't hate the ocean anymore.

00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:50,970
Pick the seaweed over here.

193
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,838
- There's a lot. - Okay.

Mmm. You've really improved.

200
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,064
We'll have lunch when you're ready.

201
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,133
Ready!

202
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,102
That's far!

203
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,439
You're going far away to get married.

204
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,641
I am?

205
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,242
Sumi, you're staying, aren't you?

206
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:34,313
They say a girl who holds her chopsticks the long way,

207

208
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:37,316
Huh?

209
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,352
So where did you come from?

210
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,923
Hmm? I came from Furue.

211
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,759
That's just one village over from where we are.

212
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,994
The women who end up living in Manchuria

213
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,496
must be using tongs.

214
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:54,667
So says Sumi, as she shifts her grip on her chopsticks.

215
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,003
Marrying close to home lacks excitement.

[door sliding open]

217
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,277
Suzu, go home right now! I just got a call...

218
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,113
A boy all the way from Kure is here.

219
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:11,517
He's asking for your hand in marriage!

220
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:11,984
Kure?

221
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:15,754
Suzu, how old are you now?

222
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:20,693
19... or actually, 18.

223
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,861
You can turn him down if you want to,

224
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,697
but at least go and meet him.

225
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,533
Suzu, come over here, please.

226
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,070
I would like for you to have this.

227
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:34,607
I prepared it for the day of your wedding.

228
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,509
I hope it'll work out for you.

229
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,080
Thank you.

230
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:46,552
You'll have the wedding with his family in Kure.

231
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,788
On your wedding night,

232
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:54,093
he'll ask, \"Did you bring an umbrella?\"

233
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:59,198
You'll answer, \"I've brought a brand new one.\"

234
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,201
Then he will ask, \"Can I open it?\"

235
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,504
And you must answer with, \"Yes.\"

236
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:06,839
But why?

237
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,340
Because you must.

238
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,810
I guess I'm becoming an adult.

239
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,279
I think Kure

240
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:17,516
is a city that has a naval port with many sailors.

241
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,090
Ah? Mizuhara?

242
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,427
It's been a while.

243
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,595
Hurry on home.

244
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:34,166
Your mother announced the news of your marriage

245
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,068
to the entire town.

246
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,772
[gasping] Wait a minute.

247
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,573
I thought you were the suitor!

248
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,475
Don't be silly!

249
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:44,610
The reason I came home

250
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:48,047
is for the anniversary of my brother's death.

251
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:52,885
You mean, you don't even know who he is?

252
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,453
Never met him.

253
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:58,090
Maybe he has me confused with Sumi.

254
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,527
Sumi's a lot prettier than me.

255
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,728
I don't think so.

256
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:08,500
So, I guess my son took a shine to your daughter

257
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:09,668
on his way to school.

258
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:13,672
It wasn't very easy to find your house, by the way.

259
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:17,776
Well, we lost the seaweed business to land reclamation

260
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,479
just about three years ago.

261
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:24,283
- She'll be home any minute. - I see.

262
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,586
I don't know if I should marry him.

263
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:32,858
But why did I taste caramel in my mouth?

264
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,393
It's so cold...

265
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,995
So what should I do?

266
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:40,499
Auntie said I can turn him down if I want to,

267
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,836
but I don't even know anything about him yet.

268
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,270
Excuse me?

269
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,172
Yes?

270
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,509
I'm afraid we're a little bit lost.

271
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:53,112
Could you tell us where the train station is at?

272
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,214
- It's this way. - Thank you.

273
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:58,717
There was a nice sailor who showed us the way, but, uh...

274
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:03,155
Oh, him. Yes, well, he's a little strange, so...

275
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,891
They said that a strange woman in the woods

276
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:08,394
had shown them the way to the station.

00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:56,420
Use the handy fireless stove of the Empire of Japan.

671
00:40:56,453 --> 00:40:58,189
Let it sit overnight.

672
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:05,863
Add miso and violet to yesterday's sardine stew.

673
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:09,900
Reheat rice on the stove.

674
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:16,841
Samurai Kusunoki's special, \"Nanko Meshi\" is served!

675
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:19,009
This one is for father-in-law.

676
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:20,177
Whoa.

677
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:25,449
We have lots of rice today. The grains are swollen.

678
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:27,785
This is a first for us.

679
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,754
- Yes. Let's eat. - Let's eat.

680
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:42,833
- We're off. - I'm sorry.

681
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:46,504
Samurai Kusunoki must've been quite a character

682
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:49,173
to enjoy eating that rice.

683
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:50,941
Yeah, you're right.

684
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:52,643
- [air raid siren blaring] - June 1944

00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:56,814

[radio tuning to frequency]

690
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:09,793
There's nothing on the radio.

691
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:12,162
Shusaku headed off for work already, did he?

692
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,397
Yes.

693
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:16,033
Estimating from the enemy's range, I would say

694
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:19,103
the best they could possibly do is reach Kyushu.

695
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:21,605
No need to run to the mountains yet, anyway.

696
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:22,806
[electricity clicks off]

697
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:25,276
It's only a blackout.

698
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:30,180
Don't fall down now.

699
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:33,684
Building removal may start soon.

700
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:36,353
It looks like they're going to build a firebreak.

701
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,555
I see.

702
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:40,457
Not around here, but in the city.

703
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:46,964
That's terrible. I surely hope they can find a place to live.

704
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:48,399
Thank you.

705
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:50,234
I have plenty of firewood.

706
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:53,604
I don't know if you heard or not,

707
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:56,340
but my house was taken away from me.

708
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:56,907
Oh, no.

709
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:01,578
The family is going to move to Shimonoseki.

710
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,847
So I left my husband's family.

711
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:04,148
What?

712
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:09,586
Oh, don't worry. I'll find a job and start working.

713
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,289
There will be more of us now.

714
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,558
Like this?

715
00:43:14,591 --> 00:43:15,926
Yes!

00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:24,168
I heard attacks on Mt. Haigamine.

719
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:25,736
I can't believe it.

720
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,771
It's getting dangerous.

721
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:32,109
- Thank you for helping us. - Yes, thank you.

722
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:35,312
My, what a well-built bomb shelter.

723
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:36,413
It is.

724
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,681
[snoring]

725
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:42,019
He worked overtime and finished our shelter.

726
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:42,353
There.

727
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:46,957
Pillars from Keiko's house really helped a lot.

728
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:52,563
Shusaku. Did you place this here?

729
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,732
Yeah. It's-- it's nothing.

730
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,736
Let's go ahead and clean up out here a little.

731
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:03,607
Shusaku, do you think I could have

732
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,709
some of this dirt for our farm?

733
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:09,847
Oh, sure, just take it. But be careful.

734
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,716
So this is where you've been.

735
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:16,053
Yes. I was looking at ships.

736
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:17,888
[grunting]

737
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:20,257
There's a lot of ships today.

738
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,793
I see two Yamato ships.

739
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,129
One of them is Musashi.

740
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:29,099
I see lots of battleships, but no aircraft carriers.

741
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:29,833
I see.

742
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:32,036
That's an aircraft cruiser.

743
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:34,038
There are no gun turrets in the back.

744
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:36,173
Can you see which one it is?

745
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:37,241
Wow!

746
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:40,344
I'm amazed that you know so much about that.

747
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:44,048
Mm, it's because my brother taught me about it.

748
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:48,085
I see. I also learned a thing or two.

749
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:50,621
- That's a destroyer. - Yeah.

750
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:52,856
Well, what about that small one?

751
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:56,226
- It's an amphibian boat. - Ah.

752
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,962
I'll teach you something in return.

753
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,865
- Look at that big cloud. - Okay.

754
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:05,035
- It's an anvil cloud. - Mm.

755
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:07,871
- It causes heavy rain. - Huh?

756
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:10,240
[thunder rumbling, rain falling]

757
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:11,775

758
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:14,178
Take everything into the shelter.

759
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:19,416
[sighing]

760
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:25,255
Thanks.

761
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:33,997
No, I can do it. I can do it.

762
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:38,001
So you like battleships, then?

763
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:40,137
You taught Harumi, right?

764
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,338
Oh...

765
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:45,409
I didn't actually teach Harumi. Hi-bo did.

766
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:46,610
Who?

767
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:50,647
Hm. Hi-bo loves battleships.

768
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:52,449
You'll meet him one day.

769
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,887
Oh. Is his name \"Hisao\"?

I can't believe I'm here, doing this with him.

00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,975
Good.

773
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:22,346
We should get going, while it's only a drizzle.

Now that you're married, It's nice to see

776
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:28,619
that you two get along so well.

777
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:32,489
It's wonderful. A happy couple.

[crickets chirping]

00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:38,629
A long time ago,

781
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:42,566
they used to measure their height like a happy family.

782
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:44,001
Yeah, looks like it.

783
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:47,638
What do you know about Keiko's husband?

784
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:49,406
The only thing that I know for sure

785
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:52,509
is that for some reason he wasn't able to go to war.

786
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:54,178
Maybe he was too frail.

787
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:59,783
When my father was rehired by the Navy Arsenal,

788
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:01,585
Keiko went to buy a watch for him,

789
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:02,920
\"Kuromura Watchmaker\"

790
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:04,555
that's where they met.

791
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:09,960
They got married and they remodeled the store.

792
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:14,364
But Keiko can be very temperamental

793
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:18,335
and she didn't get along too well with his family.

794
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:19,570
When her husband died,

795
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:23,774
they fought over the business. But in the end...

796
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:26,410
The building removal took everything away.

797
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:34,852
Hisao is the heir of the Kuromura family.

798

He was taken to Shimonoseki

I really do wish that we could all just live happily, you know?

801
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:47,931
I wish so, too.

The military police?

She was sketching shorelines and ships.

That's espionage!

She seems innocent,

but who knows what villainous ploy she's planned?

Tell me the truth.

Is she spying on any military activity?

Any signs of cryptography?

826
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:13,350
Does she have a random number table?

00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:27,030
What? Oh, uh...

1005
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:34,704
Suzu? You're very pale, are you okay?

1006
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:37,774
I guess I look funny, right?

1007
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:40,510
No. I'm happy you're okay.

1008
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:41,844
Let's go then.

1009
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,814
Go? What about work?

1010
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:49,018
There's no rush. I just wanted you to come.

1011
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:52,322
You had fun in the city, didn't you?

1012
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:58,761
What's the matter? Are-- are you ill?

1013
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:01,497
No, it's just exciting!

1014
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:03,366
[indistinct conversations]

1015
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:09,472
I wanted to take you to the cinema, but...

1016
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:11,107
[sighing]

1017
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,876
I guess a big ship is back in port.

1018
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:16,346
[whistle blowing]

1019
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:18,214
Soldiers are priority.

1020
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:21,651
Let's just go another time.

1021
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:25,121
Uh, Suzu?

1022
01:00:26,255 --> 01:00:29,592
A classmate of mine from elementary school

1023
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:31,461
became a sailor.

1024
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:33,696
What if I bump into him?

1025
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:37,133
Well, you just greet him then! What's wrong?

1026
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:41,371
I feel like if I met anyone from my past,

1027
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:44,307
I might wake up from this dream.

1028
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,141
Dream?

1029
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:47,143
Having to change my name

1030
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:50,179
and move somewhere new was hard for me,

1031
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:54,851
but you've been so kind, and I've made friends.

1032
01:00:56,219 --> 01:01:00,723
I don't want to wake up because I'm really happy to be

1033
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:02,191
who I am today.

1034
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:03,326
I see.

1035
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:07,430
The past and the paths we did not choose,

1036
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:11,401
I guess they really are like a dream, if you think about it.

1037
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:14,170
Suzu, choosing to marry you,

1038
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:17,040
was the best decision of my life.

1039
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:22,111
But I am a little worried that you've lost weight.

1040
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:26,883
I suppose that I have lost my appetite lately.

1041
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:30,186
[gasping]

1042
01:01:31,154 --> 01:01:32,321
[crying out]

1043
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,958
Here. Eat for two people!

1044
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:37,960
\"Clinic\"

1045
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:44,600
You had a lot for breakfast earlier.

1046
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:47,870
So this should be enough for you now.

1047
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:50,606
Eating for only one after all.

1048
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,375
Entering port, minimum RPM ahead.

1049
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:53,743
December 1944

1050
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:55,545
Copy. Minimum RPM ahead.

1051
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:56,512
Copy.

1052
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:03,019
I'll go ask for you. Wait here.

1053
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,253
Thanks.

1054
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:05,822
Hello?

1055
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:09,759
Whoa! A real sailor! In our house!

1056
01:02:10,827 --> 01:02:14,063
Earlier, at the well, we ran into each other.

1057
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:18,334
I'm Tetsu Mizuhara, an Aoba crewmember.

1058
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:21,404
Aoba is an armored cruiser.

1059
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:23,072
Stop, Harumi.

1060
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:24,941
[laughing]

1061
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:29,245
Wow. You're tan even in winter.

1062
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:33,149
So you came here to our house just to take a bath?

1063
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:36,519
\"Bath disembarking\" means free time,

1064
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:38,421
and I had nowhere else to go.

1065
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:41,824
So I thought of Suzu, a friend from back home.

1066
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:45,328
I want to thank you for taking care of Suzu.

1067
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:49,599
She actually only had skills for drawing and preparing seaweed.

1068
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:51,767
She must be quite useless here.

1069
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:53,269
[laughing]

1070
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:56,639
I'll take her off of your hands anytime you get tired of her!

1071
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:58,407
[laughing]

1072
01:02:58,441 --> 01:02:59,942
- [thunk] - [groaning]

1073
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:02,145
Why are you so cocky?

1074
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:05,314
And don't call me by my first name!

1075
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:08,551
What? Well, I can't call you Urano anymore.

1076
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:10,052
What do you suggest I do?

1077
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:11,154
Well...

1078
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:15,625
Suzu, you can't go around hitting sailors like that.

1079
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:17,593
[laughing]

1080
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,501
What's so funny?

1081
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:29,172
I am just laughing at how ordinary you've become.

1082
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:31,641
Mmmm... great... delicious!

1083
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:33,109
It's nothing special.

1084
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:37,780
This is heaven. Hey! Suzu, come join me!

1085
01:03:37,813 --> 01:03:39,182
Are you crazy?

1086
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:41,884
Hey, Suzu, where's the lamp at?

1087
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:44,720
Oh! I-- I think it's in the shelter.

1088
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:45,454
Okay.

1089
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:49,926
I'm going to be a sailor when I grow up, you know?

1090
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:51,761
That would be great.

1091
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:53,129
Stand up.

1092
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,430
Thank you.

1093
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:55,765
What do you say?

1094
01:03:55,798 --> 01:03:57,433
Good night.

1095
01:03:58,534 --> 01:03:59,468
Good night.

1096
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:03,873
Ahh... there's nothing like being on dry land.

1097
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:06,209
I'm retiring for the night.

1098
01:04:06,242 --> 01:04:07,643
How is the Aoba?

1099
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:12,415
We returned from Manila to carry the wounded.

1100
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:14,083
It's a great ship,

1101
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:17,186
but we haven't used it for much else, yet.

1102
01:04:19,088 --> 01:04:22,858
Shusaku, outliving our mission...

1103
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:24,961
is frustrating.

1104
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:29,599
Mr. Mizuhara, I'm the head of this family

1105
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:32,134
with my father away on duty.

1106
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:35,972
I'm sorry, but I can't let you stay the night.

1107
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:41,110
Where is...?

1108
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:43,980
I asked him to sleep in the shed.

1109
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:45,681
I thought that was appropriate.

1110
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:49,018
I was surprised to see you get angry the way you did.

1111
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:54,090
Here. I readied the bed warmer. Go and take it to him.

1112
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:56,025
And you should talk to him.

1113
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,527
You know, you may never see him again.

1114
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:02,064
[dog barking in distance]

1115
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:14,910
I'm sorry about the room.

1116
01:05:14,944 --> 01:05:16,012
[chuckling]

1117
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:18,848
Well, it's heaven compared to a hammock.

1118
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:23,419
Hey, come closer! We have a lot to talk about.

1119
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:24,253
Mm-hmm.

1120
01:05:27,923 --> 01:05:30,626
Look here. I got this for you.

1121
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:31,727
Really?

1122
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:36,299
- Are you making a pen? - Mm-hmm.

1123
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:39,168
Huh...

1124
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:49,078
- Hey, it works. - Hey, it works.

1125
01:05:49,912 --> 01:05:52,081
It looks like it came from a heron,

1126
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:54,250
but I saw it in the south.

1127
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:57,286
Wow. I didn't know they migrated.

1128
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,087
Me neither.

1129
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:02,325
Back in Eba, they just stood in the river.

1130
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:06,095
There were lots of them back in Eba.

1131
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:10,933
No, I can't draw it very well.

1132
01:06:10,966 --> 01:06:12,768
I find that very hard to believe.

1133
01:06:13,969 --> 01:06:17,973
Wait, hold on. You haven't drawn in a while?

1134
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:19,542
Well...

1135
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:24,580
That drawing of white rabbit waves...

1136
01:06:24,613 --> 01:06:26,415
Yes, I remember.

1137
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:29,885
It caused a lot of trouble.

1138
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:30,953
Huh?

1139
01:06:30,986 --> 01:06:32,388
Oh, really?

1140
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:34,724
- You forgot? - Uh...

1141
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:38,961
Our teacher entered it into some kind of contest.

1142
01:06:38,994 --> 01:06:41,664
Everyone really loved that painting,

1143
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:44,100
and I didn't know what to do.

1144
01:06:44,133 --> 01:06:47,136
They all thought I was the one who drew it,

1145
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:49,705
but the actual artist...

1146
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:51,273
...was you, of course.

1147
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:52,808
[chuckling nervously]

1148
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:02,084
Suzu, you are so warm,

1149
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:04,620
Suzu, you are so soft,

1150
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:06,122
and sweet.

1151
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:11,260
Mizuhara...

1152
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:16,766
I've been waiting for this moment forever.

1153
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,301
You coming for me...

1154
01:07:20,302 --> 01:07:23,038
You're finally here, but I just...

1155
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:26,008
[grunting]

1156
01:07:26,041 --> 01:07:30,813
I'm just angry! I'm so angry at him!

1157
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:33,516
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

1158
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:36,252
I understand.

1159
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:38,487
You really love him.

1160
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:39,588
I do.

1161
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:41,290
[sighing]

1162
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:44,293
You're surprisingly ordinary.

1163
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:45,094
Sorry.

1164
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:47,129
It's just that you still get

1165
01:07:47,163 --> 01:07:50,566
angry and sorry about ordinary things.

1166
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:52,902
Do you even want to stay here at all?
