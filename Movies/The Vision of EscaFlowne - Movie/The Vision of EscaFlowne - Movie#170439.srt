is Folken... He's my brother.

But, why are you...?

decides which of the king's sons

will become the
heir to the throne.

And for that he killed everyone?

without anyone to rule.

like a burden, can't it?

to do anymore.

I had lost all sense
of joy and purpose.

I was hurting all the time,

so I lashed out and hurt
anyone who tried to help me.

I just wanted to fade away.

certainly like to help you.

Gadarasarai song tells us:

01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:56,541
"Upon her arrival,

982

resurrect the Dragon Armor.

Gaea will be a new world."

That's part of it, but if
I remember correctly,

985
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:08,583

It also says "The Dragon Armor

986

will lay waste to all
of Gaea and vanish."

After all, it was
the Dragon Armor

that destroyed ancient Gaea.

I sense the vibrations
of the Wing Goddess.

01:15:47,958 --> 01:15:50,208
The desire she holds
within her is strong,

01:15:50,291 --> 01:15:52,583
and it seems to be
reaching the Dragon.

What of it?

1191
01:15:55,416 --> 01:15:57,916
The legend of the Goddess
says that her desire

has the power to
change the world.

1193

[FOLKEN] Her desire is
rooted in anger and hatred.

She doesn't wish to change
the world, but annihilate it.

Do you understand that?

1196
01:16:09,958 --> 01:16:13,791
She wants destruction...
and Van will give it to her.

01:22:45,416 --> 01:22:48,083
I will help you bear the
burden of your sorrow.

1277
01:22:48,166 --> 01:22:50,708
That is why I came, Folken.

1278
01:22:50,791 --> 01:22:52,875
Don't waste
your breath, brother.

1279
01:22:54,166 --> 01:22:55,458
[HITOMI]
Van!

1280
01:22:59,041 --> 01:23:01,208
[VAN]
Even if you do destroy Gaea...

1281
01:23:01,291 --> 01:23:03,291
Van.

1282
01:23:03,375 --> 01:23:06,208
[VAN] ...It won't matter,
your sorrow won't end.

1283
01:23:06,291 --> 01:23:09,000
You have no idea
what you're saying.

1284
01:23:09,083 --> 01:23:11,500
Don't you understand
anything, Van?

1285
01:23:11,583 --> 01:23:14,375
You are the source of my sorrow!

1286
01:23:18,083 --> 01:23:19,666
[HITOMI]
Stop this!

1287
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:22,000
[FOLKEN] The only thing
I desire from life,

1288
01:23:22,083 --> 01:23:25,875
is to kill you
with my bare hands.

1289
01:23:25,958 --> 01:23:27,416
Now...

1290
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:30,958
King of the Dragon Clan, get
back on your feet and fight me!

1291
01:23:31,041 --> 01:23:34,875
[VAN]
No! I won't fight anymore!

1292
01:23:34,958 --> 01:23:37,875
You have a choice:
Either fight, or die.

1293
01:23:37,958 --> 01:23:38,916
[gasps]

1294

[HITOMI gasps]

1295
01:24:04,083 --> 01:24:06,875
Hitomi! Say something!

1296
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:08,666
I'm okay, Van.

1297
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:12,333
Really... I'm all right.
He didn't hurt me.

1298
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,041
[HITOMI]
I feel sorry for him.

1299
01:24:16,125 --> 01:24:18,416
I was like that, before...

1300
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:22,333
Numb to the pain and
suffering of other people.

1301
01:24:22,416 --> 01:24:25,500
Convinced that I would
always be alone.

1302
01:24:25,583 --> 01:24:27,875
[FOLKEN] That is why
you came to this world.

1303
01:24:27,958 --> 01:24:30,041
You were responding to my call.

1304
01:24:30,125 --> 01:24:32,083
But that's not me anymore!

1305
01:24:32,166 --> 01:24:34,166
I've changed since
I came here.

1306
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:36,166
I'm not numb to Van's pain.

1307
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:38,791
I can feel his suffering!

1308
01:24:38,875 --> 01:24:40,125
His sorrow is mine.

1309
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:42,916
And you're the one
who created it!

1310
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,458
Yes...

1311
01:24:44,541 --> 01:24:47,791
This whole cursed world
is filled with sorrow.

1312
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:52,291
And its only hope of salvation
is its utter destruction.

1313
01:24:52,375 --> 01:24:55,750
I'm willing to destroy the
world to end its sorrow.

1314
01:24:55,833 --> 01:25:00,250
That is why I called you
and abandoned my own wings.

1315
01:25:00,333 --> 01:25:02,625
I pity you.

1316
01:25:02,708 --> 01:25:04,291
[JAJUKA]
Commander Folken.

1317
01:25:05,875 --> 01:25:07,958
There is something I've
wished for a long time

1318
01:25:08,041 --> 01:25:10,166
and now it will come to pass.

[JAJUKA grunts]

1323
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:28,333
You have earned this
a thousand times over.

1324
01:25:28,416 --> 01:25:32,000
You have killed so many.
Now you, too, will...

1325
01:25:32,083 --> 01:25:33,250
[groans]

1326
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:41,000
[FOLKEN grunts]
You wished for revenge.

Is he going to...?

[FOLKEN grunts]

1330
01:25:50,625 --> 01:25:52,041
Brother!

1331
01:25:52,125 --> 01:25:56,041
[FOLKEN] Stop!
Don't come any closer!

1332
01:25:56,125 --> 01:25:57,708
Brother...

1333
01:26:00,041 --> 01:26:02,000
[VAN]
Brother!

1334
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:06,583
So long it's been since
I heard that word...

1335
01:26:23,625 --> 01:26:24,583
[HITOMI gasps]

1336
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,500
You should go home now.
Leave here quickly.

1337
01:26:32,583 --> 01:26:34,208
With Commander Folken gone,

1338
01:26:34,291 --> 01:26:37,541
the castle will not remain
standing much longer.

1339
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:39,875
Fly away from this
cursed place.

1340
01:26:39,958 --> 01:26:42,958
You have wings to carry you.

1341
01:26:43,041 --> 01:26:44,750
And what about you?

1342
01:26:44,833 --> 01:26:46,000
My place is here.

1343
01:26:46,083 --> 01:26:49,041
I will remain with
Commander Folken.

1344
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,500
The castle's crumbling.

White wings.
Dragon people are dancing.

1347
01:27:46,208 --> 01:27:48,250
Thank you, Wing Goddess.

1348
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:21,833
Well, that's that.

1349
01:28:21,916 --> 01:28:25,666
The mighty Black Dragon
Empire has crumbled into dust.

1350
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:28,041
Where shall we go now, I wonder?

1351
01:28:28,125 --> 01:28:31,458
There's always another war
to be fought somewhere...

1352
01:28:31,541 --> 01:28:32,750
Let's find it!

Look at that sunset...

1355
01:30:05,916 --> 01:30:07,625
It's so lovely here.

1356
01:30:07,708 --> 01:30:09,541
How long can I stay?

1357
01:30:09,625 --> 01:30:11,416
[VAN]
I don't know, exactly.

1358
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,458
When the Mystic Moon
calls you back.

1359
01:30:13,541 --> 01:30:14,791
But until then...

1360
01:30:14,875 --> 01:30:16,875
I will be right here with you.

1361
01:30:18,541 --> 01:30:21,416
Good. I'm glad.

1362
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:24,750
Whatever happens, we'll
always be together, won't we?

that singing...?

1367
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:57,291
Just listen...
