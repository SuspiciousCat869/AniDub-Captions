[NARRATOR] Long since erased
from the records of time,

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,041
there once existed two
European Clans who served as

3
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:29,375
overseers of history
for the powers that be.

4
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:32,500
The Umbra witches,
dwellers of the darkness,

5
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:36,291
and the Lumen sages,
controllers of light.

6
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,125
The witches served the demons

7
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,458
and the sages served the angels.

8
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,750
Still the clans
respected each other,

9
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:45,708
and worked to ensure that
the balance between them

10
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,875
withstood the passage of time.

11
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:50,250
One day, that
balance was toppled,

12
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,625
resulting in an era of strife.

13
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:55,625
It began when a Lumen
sage and an Umbra witch

14
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:57,958
violated the
decrees that bound them

15
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,666
and produced a child together.

16
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,916
The woman was imprisoned
and the man was banished...

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,583
but that was
only the beginning.

18
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,541
Both clans had a law never
to be broken that stated,

19
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,291
"The intersection
of light and dark

20
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,458
will bring calamity
to this earth."

21
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,000
With the birth of this
child, it appeared that

22
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:19,291
old fear had become reality.

23
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,375
Each clan possessed an "Eye."

24
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:23,416
Together, the
"Eyes of the World"

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,916
governed the power of creation.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,375
The forbidden child, whom
the Umbra witches cared for,

27
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:32,958
possessed the powers
of the treasured Left Eye.

28
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,333
When the two eyes
are brought together,

29
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:38,041
the Creator Jubileus
will be resurrected

30
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,291
and a New World will be born.

31
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:43,541
It is both heaven's will
and order that Jubileus

32
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,458
should become
incarnate once more.

33
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:49,625
Being on the side of heaven,
the sages desired that

34
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:53,208
this should come to pass, but
the witches were against them,

35
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:57,166
resulting in a conflict
over the treasured Left Eye.

36
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,750
The conflict escalated until
it became a full-blown war

37
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:04,333
between angels and demons,
with a myriad of battles
