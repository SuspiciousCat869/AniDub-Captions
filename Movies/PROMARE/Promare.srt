The World Health Organization is investigating
cases of spontaneous human combustion.

3
00:03:09,725 --> 00:03:12,146
"Burnish" is thought to cause self-combustion.

4
00:03:12,241 --> 00:03:16,995
A Burnish independence movement is also growing,
and public opposition to it is deepening.

5
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:20,380
On a related note, UN-appointed
specialist, Professor Prometh,

6
00:03:20,483 --> 00:03:24,643
has stated that the oppression of the
Burnish may lead to concurrent blazes worldwide.

7
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,664
The Great World Blaze has come to an end.

8
00:03:49,753 --> 00:03:50,904
Half the population has been wiped out.

9
00:03:50,983 --> 00:03:56,631
30 years after the Great World Blaze,
we must strive more than ever to maintain peace.

00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:21,870
We have to burn in order to live.

167
00:16:22,185 --> 00:16:23,507
It's just who we Burnish are.

168
00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:26,009
The only thing that should be burning is your soul.

169
00:16:26,281 --> 00:16:28,957
Your blaze is a nuisance, and I'm gonna put it out!

170
00:16:29,027 --> 00:16:32,223
With my own burning soul! 'Cause that's who I am.

171
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,916
Complete nonsense.

172
00:16:33,947 --> 00:16:34,590
Shut up!

173
00:16:51,707 --> 00:16:52,594
Alley-oop!

174
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:27,311
Psych.

175
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,519
What the hell's going on? You're just a kid!

176
00:17:47,594 --> 00:17:49,254
And who are you to talk?

177
00:17:50,732 --> 00:17:53,127
Get out of my way or you're gonna die.

178
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:56,563
The Burnish don't kill people unless they're forced to.

179
00:17:58,635 --> 00:18:02,096
This is over, you're unarmed, and naked.

180
00:18:02,413 --> 00:18:05,066
That's big talk for a little pyromaniac.

181
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,622
I'm, no, actually we,

182
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:11,254
we're a rescue team.

183
00:18:30,585 --> 00:18:31,713
Lucia!

184
00:18:31,896 --> 00:18:33,069
You got it!

185
00:18:33,094 --> 00:18:33,768
Vinny!

186
00:18:42,548 --> 00:18:43,686
You like that?

187
00:18:44,603 --> 00:18:47,456
We hope you enjoy Matoi Tech rapid cooling.

188
00:18:51,835 --> 00:18:57,219
This is the invincible teamwork
of Special Mobile Firefighter Rescue Unit Burning Rescue.

189
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,373
BURNING RESCUE

190
00:18:59,565 --> 00:19:01,080
So are you amazed yet?

191
00:19:01,215 --> 00:19:03,208
You know, I didn't get naked just for fun.

192
00:19:03,398 --> 00:19:05,025
It hadn't crossed my mind.

193
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:11,774
Today you met Galo Thymos,
the unbelievable blazing firefighter with a burning soul!

194
00:19:11,926 --> 00:19:15,979
So Mad Burnish boss, burn my name into your mind.

195
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,522
It's Lio, Lio Fotia.

196
00:19:18,584 --> 00:19:20,584
LIO FOTIA

197
00:19:25,821 --> 00:19:29,530
I don't know how you got so full of
yourself, kid, but you're still just a rookie.

198
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:30,691
Owl.

199
00:19:30,821 --> 00:19:32,942
You almost wrecked that brand-new suit.

200
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:34,384
Would it kill ya to be more careful?

201
00:19:34,471 --> 00:19:36,904
You'll have better data on it now, you're welcome.

202
00:19:36,987 --> 00:19:37,914
Have some respect, rookie.

203
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,273
You know, you didn't have to hit me so hard, Varys.

204
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,166
Next time, you should hit him even harder.
Otherwise this idiot will never learn.

205
00:19:44,312 --> 00:19:45,416
You know, you got a...

206
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,788
It's Freeze Force.

207
00:20:01,264 --> 00:20:02,566
Vulcan

208
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:04,085
Colonel Vulcan.

209
00:20:04,865 --> 00:20:07,342
Good job out here today, Ignis.

210
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:08,688
VULCAN

211
00:20:10,154 --> 00:20:12,079
Mad Burnish, huh?

212
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:15,147
Don't worry, we'll take it from here.

213
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:22,471
Hey, you got some pretty ancient gear there, huh?

214
00:20:22,877 --> 00:20:26,075
Low-level rescue team sure have it hard.

215
00:20:26,401 --> 00:20:31,413
That's why Burnish crimes are always
under Freeze Force's jurisdiction.

216
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,574
Way to take credit for our work.

217
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,139
Galo, shut up, you idiot.

218
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:45,677
So it was you? You're the one who caught this guy?

219
00:20:45,817 --> 00:20:47,535
And what if I said that I was?

220
00:20:48,503 --> 00:20:50,536
You're under arrest, firefighter.

221
00:20:50,574 --> 00:20:51,560
I'm what?

222
00:20:51,847 --> 00:20:55,687
The law explicitly forbids
civilians from dealing with terrorists.

223
00:20:55,903 --> 00:20:58,820
Your lack of training could've
caused a major disaster.

224
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,661
I'm afraid I can't overlook your reckless actions.

225
00:21:01,686 --> 00:21:03,958
It's the Burnish's actions that can't be overlooked,

226
00:21:04,085 --> 00:21:06,291
and all I did was stop them from destroying the city!

227
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:09,002
You'll be free to plead your case in court.

228
00:21:09,306 --> 00:21:13,614
Hold it. We're authorized to deal
with the Burnish in a fire emergency.

229
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,302
That exception gives us jurisdiction.

230
00:21:16,397 --> 00:21:20,115
Guess who judges whether that applies or not, this guy!

231
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:22,390
I'll note that in my report.

232
00:21:26,406 --> 00:21:28,577
Vulcan.

233
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,651
What, can't take a joke?

234
00:21:35,072 --> 00:21:37,317
What a pointless internal power struggle.

235
00:21:37,628 --> 00:21:39,587
Public officials are so worthless.

236
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,516
You've got a big mouth for a Burnish.

237
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,690
Take him away!

238
00:21:53,351 --> 00:21:57,930
Looks like Vulcan was just
letting off some steam, asshole.

239
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:13,182
The Burnish suddenly appeared 30 years ago.

240
00:22:14,381 --> 00:22:19,282
Wild blazes caused by fire-wielding mutants
took a huge toll on the world.

241
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:25,676
But now, the Burnish threat is finally being driven out.

242
00:22:26,557 --> 00:22:32,568
Days ago, thanks to the noble efforts of Special
Mobile Firefighter Rescue Unit, Burning Rescue,

243
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,720
Mad Burnish's leader was arrested.

244
00:22:36,593 --> 00:22:40,924
This noble act marks the end of the flame terrorist group.

245
00:22:52,157 --> 00:22:53,077
No, wait!

246
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,297
He told you to wait! You get back here!

247
00:23:00,844 --> 00:23:02,427
It's better not to fight them.

248
00:23:03,237 --> 00:23:06,073
You'll only end up with your limbs frozen solid.

249
00:23:06,342 --> 00:23:07,693
Sure seems that way.

250
00:23:08,212 --> 00:23:08,685
Boss.

251
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,395
Look at them.

252
00:23:18,093 --> 00:23:21,029
My God. It's just like we heard.

253
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:25,550
Mad Burnish was our only hope for ages,
and now you've been captured too.

254
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:28,597
Boss, look.

255
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:40,398
Why did they do this?

256
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:50,879
Now, allow me to introduce,
Burning Rescue's rookie hero, your Galo Thymos!

257
00:23:52,662 --> 00:23:57,940
Join me as we celebrate his great
achievement, the annihilation of Mad Burnish.

258
00:23:59,162 --> 00:24:03,407
Galo please continue to protect
the citizens of Promepolis.

259
00:24:03,847 --> 00:24:05,561
You can count on me, Governor.

260
00:24:05,768 --> 00:24:09,403
I'll keep on protecting Promepolis
just like you once protected me.

261
00:24:09,774 --> 00:24:13,132
You've always been my greatest
hero and inspiration as a firefighter,

262
00:24:13,393 --> 00:24:15,362
ever since you lost your arm saving me.

263
00:24:16,035 --> 00:24:18,115
KRAY FORESIGHT

264
00:24:31,248 --> 00:24:33,258
I'm counting on you, we all are.

265
00:24:37,136 --> 00:24:41,897
One Inferno Volcano Margherita Megamax, enjoy!

266
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:52,230
Ow, so yummy and hot right from the oven.

267
00:24:52,337 --> 00:24:53,329
Two more please.

268
00:24:53,448 --> 00:24:54,390
You got it.

269
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:57,467
Gotta hand it to ya, it's always cooked just right!

270
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,691
Yeah, he's very good at what he does.

271
00:25:02,856 --> 00:25:04,761
Here ya go, enjoy!

272
00:25:06,395 --> 00:25:09,488
Saw you on TV, Galo, nice job out there.

273
00:25:09,897 --> 00:25:11,112
Oh, you mean this?

274
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:15,492
Yeah, those terrorist guys were a real pain
in the neck, you know?

275
00:25:15,832 --> 00:25:18,262
What is it they were called, the Mad Burnish?

276
00:25:18,412 --> 00:25:21,025
What a relief to know their boss is finally in jail!

277
00:25:21,112 --> 00:25:21,583
Yep!

278
00:25:21,804 --> 00:25:24,388
I'm sure some of those Burnish guys are pretty decent.

279
00:25:24,471 --> 00:25:28,002
And the discrimination is just
'cause those terrorists give 'em a bad name.

280
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,710
Yeah, I couldn't have said it better myself, Pops.

281
00:25:30,816 --> 00:25:32,663
The Burnish are just misunderstood.

282
00:25:32,893 --> 00:25:35,308
It's not like being one of them makes you a bad person.

283
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:36,548
It's a mutation.

284
00:25:37,394 --> 00:25:39,257
It says nothing about your character.

285
00:25:39,394 --> 00:25:41,191
What matters is how you use it.

286
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:43,049
Like Varys with his superhuman strength.

287
00:25:44,346 --> 00:25:49,791
Anyway, you guys can count on me for any
fire in Promepolis. I'll stake this medal on it.

288
00:25:49,997 --> 00:25:51,199
Hey, you got this man!

289
00:25:51,307 --> 00:25:52,632
Yep, we're in good hands!

290
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,065
Yeah, but who wears their medal to go get pizza?

291
00:25:58,175 --> 00:26:00,915
A real man must always wear his medals on his chest.

292
00:26:01,342 --> 00:26:03,723
Not to mention that the Governor gave it to me himself.

293
00:26:03,913 --> 00:26:04,766
It means a lot.

294
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:08,384
He saved your life or something, right?

295
00:26:08,644 --> 00:26:10,477
Yeah, when I was a kid.

296
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:13,216
He must've been a college student back then.

297
00:26:13,837 --> 00:26:16,621
Thanks to that rescue, everyone knew who he was.

298
00:26:16,706 --> 00:26:19,810
And that's how his research on
fireproof materials gained attention.

299
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,089
Before you knew it, he was a billionaire.

300
00:26:22,509 --> 00:26:26,270
Now he's the chairman of
the Foresight Foundation and the city governor.

301
00:26:26,858 --> 00:26:29,594
Talk about a meteoric rise, right?

302
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:34,440
So can't you make money with your inventions?

303
00:26:34,637 --> 00:26:37,462
Inventions that make money are nothing but heresy.

304
00:26:37,594 --> 00:26:40,532
That was totally something a mad scientist would say.

305
00:26:41,974 --> 00:26:43,919
You know, you're older sister's one too.

306
00:26:46,411 --> 00:26:47,943
Yeah, maybe.

307
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:50,060
I don't even know what she's researching.

308
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,992
Huh, looks like warp engines?

309
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,005
But they still have a long way to go.

310
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,350
You think we'll ever see something
like that in our lifetime?

311
00:26:57,636 --> 00:26:59,711
Even being able to join a rescue team.

312
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:01,278
That was thanks to Governor Kray.

313
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,208
I have to pay him back somehow,
no matter what the risks are.

314
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:08,415
Hey, Pops! We need more Inferno Margherita over here!

315
00:27:10,064 --> 00:27:12,457
Uh, I hope you don't think
we're gonna be splitting the bill.

316
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,671
Hey that's mine!

317
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,889
Freeze Force?

318
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:33,290
Nobody move a muscle!

319
00:27:35,424 --> 00:27:38,486
If you do, I'll consider you a Burnish!

320
00:27:38,543 --> 00:27:41,480
Hey, What the hell do you think you're doing...

321
00:27:43,374 --> 00:27:44,755
Oh, it's you again.

322
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,209
Shut up and watch.

323
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:48,574
You over there, don't move!

324
00:27:49,883 --> 00:27:50,485
Hey!

325
00:27:52,468 --> 00:27:53,284
Stay away!

326
00:28:00,571 --> 00:28:02,340
Pizza guy is a Burnish?

327
00:28:09,692 --> 00:28:10,906
Wait, what are you doing?

328
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:12,264
He's not a criminal!

329
00:28:12,374 --> 00:28:14,414
All he's trying to do is make some pizza!

330
00:28:15,017 --> 00:28:16,785
Did you know what he was?

331
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,865
Boss, it's okay.

332
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:25,377
It's not. Look, kid, all you are guilty of
is wanting to make the best pizza in town.

333
00:28:25,428 --> 00:28:28,634
Old man, you're under arrest too.

334
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,318
Cordon off this restaurant.

335
00:28:31,262 --> 00:28:32,382
Back off.

336
00:28:32,889 --> 00:28:34,109
That Burnish is innocent.

337
00:28:34,373 --> 00:28:36,247
And why're you dragging Pops into this?

338
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,491
He was sheltering a Burnish fugitive.

339
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:43,252
In the eyes of the law, anyone caught harboring
a Burnish is considered as guilty as the Burnish.

340
00:28:43,277 --> 00:28:47,668
You should study the law
before running around like you're some kind of hero.

341
00:28:48,857 --> 00:28:50,085
Just wait a minute!

342
00:28:50,212 --> 00:28:52,419
It's true that harboring a Burnish is a crime.

343
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:55,181
But that's a special law that applies only to terrorists!

344
00:28:55,492 --> 00:28:57,987
This guy is not a terrorist!

345
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:02,000
That's for a court to decide, not a little girl!

346
00:29:09,317 --> 00:29:12,037
You're saying this pizza was made by a Burnish?

347
00:29:12,062 --> 00:29:13,402
Oh, disgusting.

348
00:29:13,427 --> 00:29:14,674
How could they?

349
00:29:14,928 --> 00:29:16,474
It's like they served us all garbage!

350
00:29:16,499 --> 00:29:18,578
Hey, knock it off!

351
00:29:18,665 --> 00:29:21,348
Galo, you need to calm down.

352
00:29:21,514 --> 00:29:23,983
It's not like we can tell people what to think.

353
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,398
Even if it sucks.

354
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,904
Where are you going?

355
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:38,905
Lets go you three.

356
00:29:40,387 --> 00:29:41,705
You're being transferred.

357
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,132
Gueira.

358
00:29:48,227 --> 00:29:48,743
Boss.

359
00:29:48,894 --> 00:29:49,629
And Meis.

360
00:29:49,731 --> 00:29:50,129
Right.

361
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,389
Here we go.

362
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,160
Bastard!

363
00:30:09,835 --> 00:30:11,720
Burnish will always be free.

364
00:30:11,965 --> 00:30:14,207
I won't let the Foundation hold us!

365
00:30:16,517 --> 00:30:18,525
We'll rescue our wounded comrades.

366
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,042
That's much better.

367
00:30:22,126 --> 00:30:23,304
Go and free the others.

368
00:30:23,518 --> 00:30:24,042
You got it!

369
00:30:24,126 --> 00:30:24,995
Don't kill anyone.

370
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,234
We Burnish don't kill without reason.

371
00:30:27,836 --> 00:30:29,280
Yeah, yeah, I know!

372
00:30:34,725 --> 00:30:35,875
A wall of fire!

373
00:30:46,188 --> 00:30:48,410
C'mon, we're breakin' all of you out of here.

374
00:30:48,545 --> 00:30:49,711
But how did you...

375
00:30:49,843 --> 00:30:51,275
Oh, you mean the freezing rings?

376
00:30:51,441 --> 00:30:53,854
Breaking out of those was a piece of cake for the boss.

377
00:30:53,964 --> 00:30:54,655
Let's move!

378
00:31:04,383 --> 00:31:05,930
You are so irritating.

379
00:31:16,178 --> 00:31:17,918
Everyone, come on, let's go!

380
00:31:34,147 --> 00:31:37,400
I never knew this place existed, what is it?

381
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:39,076
I dunno.

382
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,329
How did you even know about it?

383
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,622
I found it totally by accident one day.

384
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,488
I was riding around all pissed off.

385
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:49,225
Now whenever I need to cool off, I just come here.

386
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:51,304
Well, I guess it's good for that.

387
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:54,210
Not many people would come all the way
out here in the mountains.

388
00:31:54,344 --> 00:31:57,574
Unless it's someone like you, who has way too much energy.

389
00:31:57,693 --> 00:31:59,769
Oh, then what are you doing out here?

390
00:31:59,866 --> 00:32:05,463
I'm here because when you left before,
you seemed like you were about to go raid Freeze Force HQ.

391
00:32:05,503 --> 00:32:07,119
Oh, you wanted to help?

392
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:08,988
No, I wanted to stop you.

393
00:32:10,486 --> 00:32:12,276
You think I'm an
idiot, don't you?

394
00:32:12,994 --> 00:32:14,169
Well, yeah.

395
00:32:14,486 --> 00:32:15,653
Jeez.

396
00:32:16,121 --> 00:32:18,409
Hey, be careful! That ice could break!

397
00:32:18,434 --> 00:32:22,922
Don't worry. I dug five meters deep
once and it was ice all the way down.

398
00:32:23,216 --> 00:32:25,480
You dug through five meters of ice?

399
00:32:25,827 --> 00:32:29,110
Yeah, I was curious to see how far down it went.

400
00:32:31,728 --> 00:32:34,617
Come on, you know you can skate with shoes too.

401
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:39,361
Well, this is a relief.

402
00:32:40,654 --> 00:32:43,615
It's good to know you've got the sense
to come here and cool off.

403
00:32:45,158 --> 00:32:47,818
The last thing I wanna do is give Gov Kray any trouble.

404
00:32:48,523 --> 00:32:51,967
Well, all the higher-ups know
that he was the one who saved my life.

405
00:32:52,752 --> 00:32:57,208
So if I go rogue and start causing trouble,
they're gonna think I'm misusing his authority.

406
00:32:57,504 --> 00:32:58,983
I can't do that to the Gov.

407
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:04,161
Wow, you do have a deep side, who'da thought?

408
00:33:05,018 --> 00:33:06,028
Know what?

409
00:33:06,606 --> 00:33:08,809
I think I understand how you feel.

410
00:33:09,391 --> 00:33:10,839
It's the same for me.

411
00:33:11,142 --> 00:33:13,481
No one ever thinks of me as just "Aina".

412
00:33:13,812 --> 00:33:16,032
I've always been Heris' younger sister.

413
00:33:16,181 --> 00:33:18,382
She was the smart one ever since we were little.

414
00:33:18,608 --> 00:33:20,390
They called her a child prodigy.

415
00:33:22,721 --> 00:33:23,776
But you know what?

416
00:33:24,526 --> 00:33:28,449
I'm actually proud,
I'm proud to be Heris Ardebit's sister.

417
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:31,263
My sister is the cornerstone of Foresight Labs.

418
00:33:31,335 --> 00:33:33,202
You should be proud of yourself too,

419
00:33:34,354 --> 00:33:35,822
because you're you, Aina.

420
00:33:58,762 --> 00:33:59,832
Burnish flame.

421
00:34:03,762 --> 00:34:04,792
Where are you going?

422
00:34:05,061 --> 00:34:07,131
You call it in, I'm gonna go check it out!

423
00:34:09,736 --> 00:34:12,117
Jeez, same old Galo.

424
00:35:17,425 --> 00:35:20,036
It's you, Mad Burnish's boss.

425
00:35:20,314 --> 00:35:24,980
It's Lio Fotia, I already told you once, Galo Thymos.

426
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:25,958
What?

427
00:35:28,029 --> 00:35:30,064
Be quiet, we're trying to eat.

428
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,393
I didn't know you Burnish even ate food.

429
00:35:42,042 --> 00:35:44,127
Is that what you really think of the Burnish?

430
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:46,717
We're human beings just like you.

431
00:35:47,192 --> 00:35:48,802
If we don't eat, we die.

432
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:54,110
You're right, I'm sorry.

433
00:35:55,223 --> 00:35:56,057
Lio.

434
00:36:00,385 --> 00:36:03,099
Hang in there, Thyma, the truck is coming.

435
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,229
A truck?

436
00:36:04,511 --> 00:36:06,479
A helicopter would be too easy to spot.

437
00:36:06,649 --> 00:36:09,354
Gueira and Meise went to find a vehicle
that can fit all of us.

438
00:36:09,737 --> 00:36:12,565
But, I don't think she's gonna...

439
00:36:13,211 --> 00:36:14,030
Let me help!

440
00:36:16,659 --> 00:36:17,534
You?

441
00:36:18,299 --> 00:36:21,142
She's in this condition because of people like you.

442
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:23,245
But I'm part of a rescue squad.

443
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:25,110
I have emergency medical training.

444
00:36:25,624 --> 00:36:27,672
I got first-aid equipment on my bike.

445
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:30,964
There's no need.

446
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:34,197
From flames to ashes, from ashes to earth.

447
00:37:35,594 --> 00:37:36,802
Rest in peace.

448
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,111
She turned into ashes?

449
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:44,672
It's the fate of the Burnish.

450
00:37:45,124 --> 00:37:45,785
What?

451
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:50,697
The flames burn our body,
but they also give us the power to regenerate it.

452
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:55,022
While we're alive, our body is eternal.

453
00:37:55,176 --> 00:37:57,463
No matter how much we burn, we recover.

454
00:37:57,887 --> 00:38:02,963
But then once our life comes to an end,
our bodies turn into ashes.

455
00:38:03,684 --> 00:38:04,604
For real?

456
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:08,366
Is it that much of a surprise? All humans die eventually.

457
00:38:08,665 --> 00:38:11,286
We feed the flames until the day we burn out.

458
00:38:11,651 --> 00:38:13,561
That certainty is a blessing.

459
00:38:14,153 --> 00:38:16,297
You're saying you only live for the flames?

460
00:38:16,396 --> 00:38:17,420
We can hear them.

461
00:38:17,782 --> 00:38:19,682
We can hear the cries of their anguish.

462
00:38:20,118 --> 00:38:24,533
Let me burn harder, burn stronger. I want to blaze hotter!

463
00:38:26,468 --> 00:38:27,958
The flames are alive.

464
00:38:28,668 --> 00:38:32,458
They call to us, and to answer their cries
is the destiny of the Burnish.

465
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:35,708
But we don't kill people.

466
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:40,262
When the Mad Burnish attack a city
we always provide an escape route.

467
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,453
And we take great pride in that.

468
00:38:43,975 --> 00:38:47,007
Boss, the truck is ready. There's room for everyone.

469
00:38:48,187 --> 00:38:51,187
Good, let's go. It's dangerous to stay here any longer.

470
00:38:53,526 --> 00:38:55,393
Oh, so you're running away again?

471
00:38:56,654 --> 00:38:59,319
That's right, as long as we're being hunted.

472
00:38:59,693 --> 00:39:02,059
Why can't you just stop starting fires?

473
00:39:02,285 --> 00:39:05,253
If you could hold back,
wouldn't you be able to live a normal life?

474
00:39:05,413 --> 00:39:07,182
Then you wouldn't have to keep running.

475
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:11,019
Do you honestly believe it's that simple?

476
00:39:12,674 --> 00:39:13,515
Yeah.

477
00:39:14,756 --> 00:39:16,158
Then you're an idiot.

478
00:39:16,661 --> 00:39:17,421
What?

479
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,128
Do you even know what killed her?

480
00:39:19,802 --> 00:39:22,305
It was the Foresight Foundation's experiments.

481
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,078
You really had no idea?

482
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,926
How naive can someone be?

483
00:39:29,688 --> 00:39:31,078
It wasn't just her.

484
00:39:31,481 --> 00:39:33,728
They were all almost killed by Kray Foresight.

485
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:37,228
He dissects us, and kills us!

486
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,978
All of it for his research, even though we're humans too.

487
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:42,228
That's a lie!

488
00:39:42,617 --> 00:39:45,370
The governor would never do something like that!

489
00:39:47,705 --> 00:39:50,410
If you want to keep ignoring the truth,
that's your choice.

490
00:39:50,853 --> 00:39:55,499
Hey, wait, hey, hey, come back!

491
00:40:18,689 --> 00:40:21,359
Galo, are you okay?

492
00:40:37,614 --> 00:40:38,416
Galo.

493
00:40:40,675 --> 00:40:42,191
You want to return it?

494
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:45,638
Yeah, Lio, the guy I captured, escaped.

495
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:48,449
Nobody reported that to me.

496
00:40:48,948 --> 00:40:50,733
I found him hiding in a cave.

497
00:40:50,977 --> 00:40:53,563
He said he escaped from your detention facility.

498
00:40:54,405 --> 00:40:58,234
Even if that is the case,
I don't see why you'd need to return it.

499
00:41:00,027 --> 00:41:02,201
Some people deserve to wear medals.

500
00:41:02,321 --> 00:41:05,608
And those medals should come from people
who deserve to award them.

501
00:41:05,868 --> 00:41:08,669
Neither you or I are worthy of this medal.

502
00:41:09,471 --> 00:41:10,796
I don't understand.

503
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:17,551
Governor Kray, is it true that you're doing
human experiments, with Burnish prisoners?

504
00:41:24,969 --> 00:41:26,223
You're my hero.

505
00:41:26,888 --> 00:41:31,568
You saved my life, started the Foundation,
and even built this city.

506
00:41:32,143 --> 00:41:34,514
How could you do such a horrible thing?

507
00:41:35,322 --> 00:41:36,187
Horrible?

508
00:41:38,274 --> 00:41:42,953
The Burnish are people too.
They get hungry, they cry when they lose a friend.

509
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:46,622
We can't just let them start fires,
but you can arrest them and leave it at that!

510
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:49,037
You can't just kill them for no reason!

511
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:58,341
I see, please follow me.

512
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:13,518
Ever since the Burnish appeared 30 years ago,
magma from the Earth's core has been out of control.

513
00:42:14,352 --> 00:42:18,693
At it's current rate,
it will completely cover the planet in six months.

514
00:42:18,815 --> 00:42:19,402
What?

515
00:42:27,112 --> 00:42:28,258
What the heck?

516
00:42:33,538 --> 00:42:37,407
The devastation will make
the Great World Blaze look like nothing.

517
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:40,817
Our Earth will become a dead planet.

518
00:42:40,887 --> 00:42:41,928
No way.

519
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:01,232
Why so many doors?

520
00:43:05,444 --> 00:43:09,976
This is the Parnassus Project, mankind's last hope.

521
00:43:10,157 --> 00:43:12,401
Is this a, spaceship?

522
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:19,208
We've discovered a planet very similar to
Earth four light years from here, Omega Centauri.

523
00:43:20,433 --> 00:43:23,905
The interstellar cruise vessel, Parnassus,
will be our new Noah's Ark.

524
00:43:24,398 --> 00:43:28,843
It will carry 10,000 chosen ones,
who'll migrate to Omega Centauri.

525
00:43:30,508 --> 00:43:33,133
Wait, only 10,000 people?

526
00:43:33,222 --> 00:43:37,101
Yes, that's the maximum number of passengers it can carry.

527
00:43:38,436 --> 00:43:39,443
No way.

528
00:43:51,247 --> 00:43:52,192
You.

529
00:43:55,161 --> 00:43:56,444
Aina's sister.

530
00:43:56,996 --> 00:43:58,694
HERIS

531
00:43:59,373 --> 00:44:00,739
What is he doing here?

532
00:44:00,815 --> 00:44:03,502
It's okay, progress report?

533
00:44:03,586 --> 00:44:06,498
Uh, yes, we're about to start the final test now.

534
00:44:06,964 --> 00:44:11,321
That's the pizza guy, what are you doing to him?

535
00:44:11,427 --> 00:44:12,426
Just watch.

536
00:44:12,845 --> 00:44:13,914
Initiate test.

537
00:44:14,201 --> 00:44:15,175
Initiating test.

538
00:44:15,473 --> 00:44:16,924
Activate Prometech pod.

539
00:44:28,402 --> 00:44:29,236
Activate warp.

540
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:32,466
Activate warp.

541
00:44:39,497 --> 00:44:40,810
Stop Prometech pod.

542
00:44:40,973 --> 00:44:41,915
Stopping the pod.

543
00:44:42,163 --> 00:44:43,334
It was successful.

544
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,415
Full implementation of the warp engine is in sight.

545
00:44:47,713 --> 00:44:49,213
It's just as I told you.

546
00:44:49,879 --> 00:44:52,760
We should have been using the Prometech engine
from the beginning.

547
00:44:54,768 --> 00:44:56,128
That's horrible.

548
00:44:56,722 --> 00:44:59,891
It's a precious sacrifice for the survival of mankind.

549
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:04,124
We can't build the warp engine without the Burnish.

550
00:45:04,453 --> 00:45:06,246
There has to be some other way.

551
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:10,215
If we can just stop the magma,
then we won't have to go to another planet!

552
00:45:10,277 --> 00:45:12,110
I've considered that, of course.

553
00:45:12,321 --> 00:45:16,972
But with our current technology,
there's no way to stop the magma's rampage.

554
00:45:17,662 --> 00:45:19,455
Migration is our best bet.

555
00:45:19,537 --> 00:45:22,003
So you have to sacrifice the Burnish?

556
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,252
Exactly, do you understand what I'm doing now?

557
00:45:27,169 --> 00:45:30,903
Yeah, I do, but there's no way I can accept it.

558
00:45:31,605 --> 00:45:33,216
Okay, what then?

559
00:45:33,426 --> 00:45:37,188
Extinguish the magma and I'll do it myself!

560
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:41,516
I knew that's what you'd say, Galo.

561
00:45:43,436 --> 00:45:46,605
We're short on time, we can't have an idiot making a fuss.

562
00:45:48,288 --> 00:45:50,701
Gov Kray, why?

563
00:45:51,514 --> 00:45:53,273
Don't call me "Gov"!

564
00:45:58,346 --> 00:45:59,491
It's Governor!

565
00:46:00,036 --> 00:46:02,241
I've always hated when you say that!

566
00:46:03,457 --> 00:46:06,569
You've never been anything but an eyesore to me!

567
00:46:07,543 --> 00:46:08,919
Take him away.

568
00:46:09,488 --> 00:46:11,409
What the hell is going on here?

569
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:13,404
Why are you doing this, Kray?

570
00:46:15,051 --> 00:46:15,734
Kray.

571
00:46:15,885 --> 00:46:17,682
Begin the final stage of tuning.

572
00:46:17,996 --> 00:46:20,551
We'll install the Prometech engine on the Parnassus.

573
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:23,003
Biar, call the car.

574
00:46:23,127 --> 00:46:23,768
Yes, sir.

575
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:29,053
Let me out of here!

576
00:46:30,649 --> 00:46:33,412
Hello, is anybody out there?

577
00:46:33,539 --> 00:46:37,198
Somebody just open the door already,
I shouldn't be in here!

578
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:40,602
Kray, why?

579
00:46:41,982 --> 00:46:45,411
Kray, you were my hero, why?

580
00:46:50,711 --> 00:46:52,918
You knew I was against this course of action.

581
00:46:53,528 --> 00:46:56,274
We've already completed production of the pods.

582
00:46:56,759 --> 00:46:59,668
So you were planning to use
the Prometech engine from the start?

583
00:46:59,779 --> 00:47:03,641
Yes, I was just waiting for you to find your resolve.

584
00:47:04,946 --> 00:47:06,519
What kind of person are you?

585
00:47:06,596 --> 00:47:09,179
We're going to abandon most of mankind.

586
00:47:09,772 --> 00:47:14,182
If you lack the will to make hard decisions,
you aren't going to survive what's coming.

587
00:47:15,903 --> 00:47:17,682
How's the Burnish crackdown going?

588
00:47:17,905 --> 00:47:19,937
Freeze Force has already been deployed.

589
00:47:20,991 --> 00:47:24,287
The final act, we're going to be busy.

590
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,954
We're approaching our destination.

591
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:40,038
Let's show them what we've got.

592
00:47:40,141 --> 00:47:42,516
Who would've thought they'd be hiding right here?

593
00:47:42,872 --> 00:47:45,257
The darkest place is under the candlestick.

594
00:47:45,391 --> 00:47:48,641
We didn't notice them with all these volcanoes around.

595
00:47:57,444 --> 00:47:58,359
Check that out!

596
00:47:58,452 --> 00:47:59,362
Hey, wait!

597
00:48:06,662 --> 00:48:09,032
Everyone, run, it's Freeze Force!

598
00:48:48,379 --> 00:48:54,297
Whoa, careful, we're not trying to kill these guys.
They're our precious fuel!

599
00:49:07,181 --> 00:49:08,697
How the hell did you find us?

600
00:49:09,776 --> 00:49:13,744
Gee, I dunno, kid. Let's see if you can guess.

601
00:49:15,512 --> 00:49:17,149
Watch your back, Lio.

602
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,457
Boss! You bastard!

603
00:49:30,287 --> 00:49:32,905
Mr. Vulcan, I've been waiting for you!

604
00:49:33,499 --> 00:49:35,507
You told him, what have you done?

605
00:49:35,626 --> 00:49:36,460
Now!

606
00:49:40,892 --> 00:49:45,400
It was the sweet old man.
We implanted a tracker before you left.

607
00:49:45,503 --> 00:49:46,606
That was foolish.

608
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,481
No, you're the fool!

609
00:49:49,712 --> 00:49:52,124
We don't stand a chance against the Foundation.

610
00:49:52,291 --> 00:49:56,449
The less time you have left,
the more you value saving your own skin.

611
00:49:56,973 --> 00:49:58,973
Thank you for your service old man.

612
00:50:02,569 --> 00:50:08,115
We can't let good fuel go to waste, can we?
Even this old geezer can still be of some use.

613
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:08,980
Bastard!

614
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:10,402
<b><i>ΛSHES</i></b>

615
00:50:10,452 --> 00:50:13,412
The Absolute Zero Chain Freezing Bullet.

616
00:50:13,539 --> 00:50:16,188
It freezes by absorbing your body heat.

617
00:50:16,618 --> 00:50:18,419
Good luck burning through that.

618
00:50:20,756 --> 00:50:25,318
By the way, I knew you'd let yourself
be captured so you could free the prisoners.

619
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:28,876
You actually thought you outsmarted us, didn't you?!

620
00:50:30,556 --> 00:50:32,896
We saw you coming from a mile away!

621
00:50:36,603 --> 00:50:37,896
Not today!

622
00:50:38,731 --> 00:50:43,944
You ended up gathering all the Burnish together
for us to pick up, how considerate.

623
00:50:45,021 --> 00:50:47,356
Let me show you my gratitude.

624
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:52,286
Vulcan, Vulcan, Vulcan, Vulcan.

625
00:50:54,288 --> 00:50:55,725
This is for the boss!

626
00:50:57,583 --> 00:50:59,200
And this is for the settlement!

627
00:50:59,501 --> 00:51:00,944
Burnish scum!

628
00:51:04,613 --> 00:51:05,901
We'll make you pay!

629
00:51:17,436 --> 00:51:19,343
Stop it, get out of here now!

630
00:51:19,396 --> 00:51:20,475
Forget about us!

631
00:51:20,507 --> 00:51:23,111
The Burnish's flame won't fade as long as you live!

632
00:51:23,136 --> 00:51:25,481
The boss's flames are invincible!

633
00:51:25,788 --> 00:51:26,903
Please stop!

634
00:51:33,576 --> 00:51:34,976
No you don't!

635
00:51:37,423 --> 00:51:38,538
Go!

636
00:51:40,793 --> 00:51:42,035
Guys, no!

637
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:45,703
We did it!

638
00:51:51,136 --> 00:51:52,918
You think you're so smart.

639
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:59,976
Where did that blast send Lio?

640
00:52:00,062 --> 00:52:02,096
A crater inside Fennel Volcano.

641
00:52:02,231 --> 00:52:05,515
We don't have the right kind of equipment
to withstand that kind of heat.

642
00:52:05,818 --> 00:52:11,365
It doesn't matter. There's no way he'll
survive. That absolute zero bullet won't fail.

643
00:53:35,782 --> 00:53:38,402
Governor Kray, the test was a success.

644
00:53:38,508 --> 00:53:40,907
Yes, we've confirmed the same from here.

645
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:42,331
Well done, Doctor.

646
00:53:43,248 --> 00:53:45,904
We will commence the Parnassus Project immediately.

647
00:53:46,168 --> 00:53:46,600
Yes, sir.

648
00:53:47,323 --> 00:53:51,590
We'll start contacting selected citizens
in accordance to the simulations.

649
00:53:59,184 --> 00:54:00,762
Hey, were you able to find him?

650
00:54:01,892 --> 00:54:04,728
No luck, he wasn't even at the frozen lake.

651
00:54:10,067 --> 00:54:12,961
The last time anyone saw him,
he was on his way to see the Govenor.

652
00:54:12,986 --> 00:54:14,776
It's not like Galo to miss a shift.

653
00:54:14,863 --> 00:54:16,512
It's been a week already.

654
00:54:17,027 --> 00:54:20,023
Jeez, where did that idiot disappear to?

655
00:54:20,403 --> 00:54:23,121
I've got so much new stuff that I wanna test out!

656
00:54:23,518 --> 00:54:27,592
I wish you and Galo would stop wasting
all this time on your personal projects.

657
00:54:27,617 --> 00:54:32,207
It isn't a waste of time.
They're for emergency use, you never know.

658
00:54:32,631 --> 00:54:34,210
Emergency, right.

659
00:54:34,466 --> 00:54:35,551
That idiot!

660
00:54:38,098 --> 00:54:42,836
Well, I finally got word from a friend
at the city office, Galo has been arrested.

661
00:54:43,225 --> 00:54:44,925
What, but why?

662
00:54:44,963 --> 00:54:46,733
They're saying that he's a terrorist.

663
00:54:47,145 --> 00:54:50,265
He was arrested after an alleged attack on the governor.

664
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:51,641
Impossible!

665
00:54:52,859 --> 00:54:54,138
Do you think it's true, Captain?

666
00:54:54,861 --> 00:54:57,277
True or not, Galo's been arrested.

667
00:54:57,447 --> 00:55:00,402
Hmm, the whole thing sounds kinda fishy.

668
00:55:02,542 --> 00:55:03,412
What the heck?

669
00:55:06,415 --> 00:55:07,662
Aina, where are you going?

670
00:55:13,589 --> 00:55:16,978
You can wait outside.
Don't worry, I'll shout if I need help.

671
00:55:29,062 --> 00:55:30,387
You sure about that?

672
00:55:30,884 --> 00:55:33,817
I'm sure you're not the kind of
guy who'd attack an unarmed person.

673
00:55:34,901 --> 00:55:39,615
Aina always said you were honest,
and maybe too blunt for your own good.

674
00:55:41,028 --> 00:55:43,306
Here, you should eat something.

675
00:55:44,077 --> 00:55:45,446
It'll be your last supper.

676
00:55:47,873 --> 00:55:49,678
You can't be okay with this.

677
00:55:50,551 --> 00:55:52,456
Aina told me that she's proud of you.

678
00:55:53,086 --> 00:55:56,681
Does she know anything about the migration?
Or what you're doing to the Burnish?

679
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:58,818
What I tell Aina is none of your business.

680
00:55:58,921 --> 00:56:00,572
She doesn't know, does she?

681
00:56:00,844 --> 00:56:02,967
There's no way she would be okay with this!

682
00:56:03,096 --> 00:56:05,779
You know it's wrong, that's why you haven't told her.

683
00:56:05,826 --> 00:56:08,930
It's because, if it'd guarantee Aina's survival,

684
00:56:09,227 --> 00:56:10,926
I'm prepared to do anything.

685
00:56:12,856 --> 00:56:14,930
And you think Aina will be able to live with that?

686
00:56:22,324 --> 00:56:23,173
Heris!

687
00:56:23,955 --> 00:56:24,573
Aina.

688
00:56:26,033 --> 00:56:28,406
Heris, is it true Galo was arrested?

689
00:56:28,431 --> 00:56:28,994
Yes.

690
00:56:29,498 --> 00:56:32,000
There must be a mistake. He's not a terrorist.

691
00:56:32,109 --> 00:56:34,994
Please, you have to talk to Governor Kray, help him!

692
00:56:35,405 --> 00:56:36,988
Aina, I need you to calm down.

693
00:56:37,095 --> 00:56:37,963
Heris?

694
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:42,219
I saw it happen with my own eyes.
He really did try to assault the governor.

695
00:56:45,305 --> 00:56:48,558
Listen to me, Aina.
You need to start thinking about yourself now.

696
00:56:50,602 --> 00:56:52,292
I'm going to contact you soon.

697
00:56:52,562 --> 00:56:55,102
Come straight here as soon as you get that call.

698
00:56:55,565 --> 00:56:56,483
Can you do that?

699
00:57:00,153 --> 00:57:01,272
I love you, Aina.

700
00:57:03,516 --> 00:57:04,199
Heris...

701
00:57:50,662 --> 00:57:51,855
I won't forgive you.

702
00:57:53,656 --> 00:57:59,258
I'm gonna make you pay, Kray Foresight!

703
00:58:10,135 --> 00:58:13,907
You're gonna feel it, the rage of the Burnish!

704
00:58:37,512 --> 00:58:38,257
What happened?

705
00:58:38,393 --> 00:58:41,215
Unexplained fires have broken out all over Promepolis.

706
00:58:41,421 --> 00:58:43,963
A massive Burnish flare is coming from underground.

707
00:58:44,049 --> 00:58:46,419
This is a message for Kray Foresight.

708
00:58:46,676 --> 00:58:48,737
Release all Burnish prisoners immediately.

709
00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:52,521
If not, I will turn Promepolis to ash.

710
00:58:53,019 --> 00:58:55,013
And I will show no mercy.

711
00:59:02,132 --> 00:59:04,487
Is that, is that Lio?

712
00:59:09,041 --> 00:59:13,105
That fire... is he crying?

713
00:59:20,404 --> 00:59:23,983
Lio Fotia, surprised you're still alive.

714
00:59:24,172 --> 00:59:25,991
So sad it was for nothing!

715
00:59:32,091 --> 00:59:35,350
So irritating, be gone!

716
00:59:42,774 --> 00:59:44,917
Now you die!

717
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,990
Vulcan, Vulcan, Vul, Vul, Vul!

718
01:00:12,263 --> 01:00:13,594
Stupid eyelid!

719
01:00:20,477 --> 01:00:22,903
How long will you hide behind these weaklings?

720
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,443
Show yourself, Kray Foresight!

721
01:00:34,618 --> 01:00:36,536
The source of the fire's moving too fast.

722
01:00:37,201 --> 01:00:38,204
We cant keep up.

723
01:00:39,247 --> 01:00:43,661
This is bad, Captain. Every single one of the
Freeze Force interceptors has been shot down.

724
01:00:45,032 --> 01:00:50,124
Varys, get to C-5, that's the worst of it.
The rest of us will do what we can in transit.

725
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:51,239
Yes, sir!

726
01:00:57,848 --> 01:00:58,400
Galo?

727
01:00:58,475 --> 01:00:59,345
Captain Ignis!

728
01:00:59,517 --> 01:01:01,095
Captain, you've gotta listen!

729
01:01:01,227 --> 01:01:03,396
Fire, big one, it's moving!

730
01:01:03,491 --> 01:01:05,230
You mean like the one on your ass?

731
01:01:05,315 --> 01:01:09,340
Ow, ow, ow! It's hot, it's hot!

732
01:01:10,811 --> 01:01:13,356
Wait up, guys I'm comin' too!

733
01:01:14,824 --> 01:01:16,577
Weren't you, in jail?

734
01:01:16,653 --> 01:01:18,101
Worry about that later.

735
01:01:18,211 --> 01:01:18,675
Right.

736
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:22,072
Putting out that fire's our
first priority, same as always.

737
01:01:22,832 --> 01:01:23,946
Did you escape or something?

738
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:24,831
Yeah.

739
01:01:25,216 --> 01:01:25,922
Galo!

740
01:01:26,419 --> 01:01:29,830
I am Galo Thymos, a firefighter with a burning soul!

741
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:31,675
This is right where I belong!

742
01:01:33,551 --> 01:01:36,301
Tuned her up good as new, orders from the captain.

743
01:01:37,234 --> 01:01:41,128
Captain, Captain, don't worry I've got this.

744
01:01:41,413 --> 01:01:42,056
Aina!

745
01:01:42,445 --> 01:01:42,936
Hm?

746
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:35,795
Mad Burnish, I'm the one you want.

747
01:02:37,255 --> 01:02:38,088
Finally.

748
01:02:40,616 --> 01:02:41,450
Kray...

749
01:02:43,184 --> 01:02:46,666
Kray Foresight!

750
01:02:52,208 --> 01:02:56,543
Bring it on, Mad Burnish bastard!

751
01:03:06,561 --> 01:03:08,783
Ow, it's hot!

752
01:03:12,513 --> 01:03:15,938
Galo, stay out of this!

753
01:03:16,631 --> 01:03:21,502
It's not that hot at all!

754
01:03:22,118 --> 01:03:25,083
Your spiteful flames are barely even lukewarm!

755
01:03:25,297 --> 01:03:27,547
I was honestly expecting more from you!

756
01:03:27,874 --> 01:03:33,129
The temperature of my burning firefighter's
soul is a million and ten times...

757
01:03:34,547 --> 01:03:36,813
<i>HOTTER!</i>

758
01:03:38,426 --> 01:03:40,325
Oh, it's cold, it's cold!

759
01:04:10,134 --> 01:04:11,387
So be it.

760
01:04:20,696 --> 01:04:22,593
You again, Galo Thymos!

761
01:04:23,138 --> 01:04:26,754
I understand your anger. I was betrayed by Kray too!

762
01:04:27,267 --> 01:04:27,709
What?

763
01:04:27,791 --> 01:04:33,014
But even still, I can't just sit back and let
you take it out on a bunch of innocent people!

764
01:04:33,148 --> 01:04:34,125
Yeah right!

765
01:04:34,315 --> 01:04:37,527
You're the ones doing human
experiments on innocent Burnish!

766
01:04:37,685 --> 01:04:41,558
Didn't you tell me you took pride
in not killing people without a reason?

767
01:04:45,252 --> 01:04:48,442
All right, you two, why don't you cool off a little bit?

768
01:04:54,204 --> 01:04:57,317
Ow, it's hot, it's so hot!

769
01:05:21,988 --> 01:05:23,649
So did you calm down a little?

770
01:05:23,823 --> 01:05:25,575
Guys, are you seeing this?

771
01:05:31,892 --> 01:05:33,282
What is this place?

772
01:05:34,959 --> 01:05:36,708
The structure isn't even wet.

773
01:05:37,513 --> 01:05:40,752
It was in some kind of cavity, underneath all that ice.

774
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:42,050
That is correct.

775
01:05:43,406 --> 01:05:46,001
Greetings, Galo Thymos and Lio Fotia.

776
01:05:46,137 --> 01:05:48,121
That's weird, How do you know our names?

777
01:05:48,251 --> 01:05:49,621
Yeah, and who are you?

778
01:05:49,724 --> 01:05:53,653
I need to speak to you both immediately, kindly follow me.

779
01:05:59,816 --> 01:06:02,195
What are you doing, don't follow it.

780
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:16,266
Great job, everybody. I can't believe
that idiotic move actually worked.

781
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:18,204
It's the idiot's superpower.

782
01:06:18,544 --> 01:06:21,243
Doesn't really matter, man, he's still an idiot.

783
01:06:21,413 --> 01:06:22,205
Where's Aina?

784
01:06:22,423 --> 01:06:24,830
No word from her since she ran off with the idiot.

785
01:06:25,468 --> 01:06:27,717
We don't have time to worry about the two of them.

786
01:06:27,887 --> 01:06:29,405
We've got rescue work to do.

787
01:06:29,461 --> 01:06:30,500
You got it, boss!

788
01:06:31,891 --> 01:06:34,857
Governor, the fires in town have been extinguished.

789
01:06:35,103 --> 01:06:37,431
The transport network will soon be back to normal.

790
01:06:37,647 --> 01:06:38,552
Very good.

791
01:06:38,648 --> 01:06:43,087
Bring the selected citizens on board and make
sure to keep the rest of the population from the ship.

792
01:06:43,369 --> 01:06:45,113
Parnassus is about to launch.

793
01:06:46,287 --> 01:06:48,947
Activity in the earth's core has intensified.

794
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:50,752
We've run out of time.

795
01:07:20,096 --> 01:07:21,608
Where are we?

796
01:07:22,358 --> 01:07:24,610
Some kind of research facility?

797
01:07:25,611 --> 01:07:28,396
So, you're not going to announce the Prometech pod?

798
01:07:28,698 --> 01:07:34,485
No, killing the Burnish for energy is unconscionable.
I can't make such a thing public.

799
01:07:34,751 --> 01:07:38,330
I understand, you haven't told
anyone else about it, correct?

800
01:07:38,496 --> 01:07:40,918
You and I are the only ones who know about it.

801
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:42,615
And the same for the Promare?

802
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:43,886
That's correct.

803
01:07:44,003 --> 01:07:46,630
Well, that is a relief.

804
01:07:47,508 --> 01:07:52,258
Someone must shoulder the fate of mankind,
and if you won't, I will.

805
01:07:52,508 --> 01:07:54,474
Actually, it should be me.

806
01:07:54,607 --> 01:07:56,457
You, my research...

807
01:07:56,601 --> 01:07:58,504
Yes, I'm taking it all.

808
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:00,754
Have you been planning this all along?

809
01:08:00,857 --> 01:08:03,529
I don't know, maybe I have been.

810
01:08:11,299 --> 01:08:13,643
So Governor Kray is a murderer?

811
01:08:13,696 --> 01:08:16,864
That guy that he killed,
he's the one that brought us here.

812
01:08:16,954 --> 01:08:19,116
Exactly, I was murdered by Kray.

813
01:08:19,916 --> 01:08:20,804
Who are you?

814
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:24,559
Deus Prometh, a researcher specializing in the Burnish.

815
01:08:24,598 --> 01:08:27,994
Instant freezing agent, fireproof armor, all of it,

816
01:08:28,090 --> 01:08:31,209
they're all anti-Burnish patents
belonging to the Foundation.

817
01:08:31,302 --> 01:08:34,942
Those are all my inventions.
Kray stole them and released them as his own.

818
01:08:36,224 --> 01:08:38,429
So how are you talking to us?

819
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:42,109
I have backed up my entire
consciousness into this computer,

820
01:08:42,271 --> 01:08:46,456
so that I might live once again
after the termination of my physical body.

821
01:08:46,599 --> 01:08:49,612
Of course, I made sure Kray didn't find out.

822
01:08:49,675 --> 01:08:51,614
A virtual personality?

823
01:08:51,911 --> 01:08:53,962
How did you know our names?

824
01:08:54,805 --> 01:08:57,275
I was able to hack into the Promepolis network.

825
01:08:58,035 --> 01:09:02,264
I stay informed on whatever happens there,
so that I can keep an eye on Kray.

826
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:05,637
What's going on? Is that...

827
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,840
Volcanic eruption in South-West Promepolis.

828
01:09:35,366 --> 01:09:36,621
Core magma activity?

829
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,848
Core magma activity is within our projected models.

830
01:09:40,121 --> 01:09:42,065
Good, get ready for departure.

831
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:44,772
All of the passengers are already on board.

832
01:09:45,125 --> 01:09:46,888
Governor, please, you have to wait.

833
01:09:47,312 --> 01:09:48,045
What's wrong?

834
01:09:48,578 --> 01:09:49,951
Aina isn't on board.

835
01:09:50,173 --> 01:09:53,505
We tried to contact her,
but she didn't respond to the transmission.

836
01:09:53,634 --> 01:09:55,788
You can't launch until she gets here.

837
01:09:56,345 --> 01:09:57,383
What are you saying?

838
01:09:57,638 --> 01:10:00,198
If she doesn't survive, this will all be for nothing!

839
01:10:00,349 --> 01:10:04,459
We'll wait as long as possible.
But we can't postpone the launch because of one person.

840
01:10:04,937 --> 01:10:06,481
I'm sure you understand.

841
01:10:09,187 --> 01:10:11,378
Return to your post, Dr. Heris.

842
01:10:13,488 --> 01:10:14,260
Kray...

843
01:10:16,491 --> 01:10:17,642
Immediately.

844
01:10:20,664 --> 01:10:21,807
What is that?

845
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:23,076
It's a spaceship.

846
01:10:23,331 --> 01:10:25,381
Kray took me underground and showed me.

847
01:10:25,416 --> 01:10:26,075
What?

848
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:30,171
Magma is about to gush out of the Earth, and go, ka-boom!

849
01:10:31,672 --> 01:10:34,105
Their plan is to run away to another planet.

850
01:10:34,583 --> 01:10:36,795
The ship can only hold 10,000 people.

851
01:10:37,136 --> 01:10:38,507
Only 10,0007?

852
01:10:38,714 --> 01:10:41,852
And that's not all, the ship is human powered.

853
01:10:41,891 --> 01:10:42,423
What?

854
01:10:43,245 --> 01:10:46,882
They're going to use the Burnish's flames
as fuel for their warp engine.

855
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:49,731
And using that fuel will cost them their life.

856
01:10:50,113 --> 01:10:51,235
That monster.

857
01:10:51,459 --> 01:10:52,242
I know.

858
01:10:53,402 --> 01:10:57,287
Galo, my sister, was she working on this thing?

859
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:00,440
She was, wasn't she?

860
01:11:00,713 --> 01:11:01,335
Yeah.

861
01:11:02,019 --> 01:11:03,278
Kray is a fool.

862
01:11:03,621 --> 01:11:05,290
What he fails to realize,

863
01:11:05,393 --> 01:11:08,242
is that the instant he ignites that incomplete engine,

864
01:11:08,376 --> 01:11:10,502
the entire Earth will be destroyed.

865
01:11:10,586 --> 01:11:11,389
Whoa, wait, what?

866
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:13,841
If he hurts the Burnish with the Prometech engine,

867
01:11:13,965 --> 01:11:16,503
the Promare in the Earth's core will retaliate.

868
01:11:17,343 --> 01:11:19,003
The planet will be doomed.

869
01:11:19,303 --> 01:11:20,376
What do you mean?

870
01:11:20,694 --> 01:11:24,261
The energy the Burnish use only appear to be flames.

871
01:11:24,367 --> 01:11:28,430
They are in fact a fire-based life-form,
from a parallel universe.

872
01:11:28,596 --> 01:11:30,715
What, a fire-based life-form?

873
01:11:30,823 --> 01:11:33,255
I named them "The Promare."

874
01:11:33,901 --> 01:11:34,847
Promare?

875
01:11:35,091 --> 01:11:35,932
Correct.

876
01:11:36,244 --> 01:11:40,397
Together, they form a sentient-fixed star
in this parallel universe.

877
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:43,884
In other words, it's an aggregate of living organisms,

878
01:11:44,053 --> 01:11:46,283
achieving life through nuclear fusion

879
01:11:46,414 --> 01:11:49,255
and consciousness via electromagnetic fields.

880
01:11:50,058 --> 01:11:55,254
What we see as flames are but a fraction of their energy
seeping through a space-time rupture.

881
01:11:56,883 --> 01:11:59,362
What is this old guy even talking about?

882
01:11:59,719 --> 01:12:05,210
30 years ago, a distortion of space time,
linked Earth's core to the Promare universe.

883
01:12:06,356 --> 01:12:08,709
Some humans resonate with the Promare

884
01:12:08,804 --> 01:12:11,022
and thus can use their power at will.

885
01:12:12,023 --> 01:12:14,014
Some humans, you mean the Burnish.

886
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:15,219
That is correct.

887
01:12:15,568 --> 01:12:20,236
So it's the Promare,
their voices pushing us to burn harder and stronger.

888
01:12:20,894 --> 01:12:23,736
If that's true then everything we've been doing here...

889
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:27,018
Harnessing the Promare's inter-dimensional energy,

890
01:12:27,133 --> 01:12:30,169
it is indeed possible to achieve teleportation.

891
01:12:30,668 --> 01:12:34,714
But the nerve signals of a Burnish
are linked to the Promare they've synced with.

892
01:12:35,477 --> 01:12:37,766
The Promare feel the Burnish's pain.

893
01:12:38,375 --> 01:12:42,771
If these incomplete Prometech pods
cause a large number of Burnish great pain,

894
01:12:43,226 --> 01:12:46,562
the Promare in Earth's core will spiral out of control,

895
01:12:46,817 --> 01:12:48,148
destroying the planet.

896
01:12:50,552 --> 01:12:53,234
So the Promare are located in the center of the Earth?

897
01:12:53,296 --> 01:12:55,465
That is where the space-time rupture is.

898
01:12:55,632 --> 01:12:57,385
And that is where the Promare live.

899
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:01,107
Galo Thymos, Lio Fotia,

900
01:13:01,614 --> 01:13:04,177
I want you to stop Kray Foresight.

901
01:13:06,744 --> 01:13:07,894
Wait, us?

902
01:13:07,997 --> 01:13:12,215
Yes, using the complete Prometech engine
that I have built.

903
01:13:13,172 --> 01:13:13,974
But how?

904
01:13:14,293 --> 01:13:15,753
With this.

905
01:13:18,902 --> 01:13:26,328
A super weapon I have created
in the event of Promare disaster, Deus X Machina!

906
01:13:26,353 --> 01:13:29,432
DEUS X MACHINA

907
01:13:30,883 --> 01:13:33,009
Well, this thing looks like a lot of fun.

908
01:13:33,136 --> 01:13:34,730
How did they already get in there?

909
01:13:35,815 --> 01:13:38,765
The completed Prometech engine causes no pain.

910
01:13:39,527 --> 01:13:41,834
It uses Lio's body as a gateway,

911
01:13:41,945 --> 01:13:44,237
through which the Promare energy is channeled.

912
01:13:44,782 --> 01:13:48,703
All you have to do,
is focus on synchronizing with the Promare.

913
01:13:53,874 --> 01:13:55,042
But why us?

914
01:13:56,127 --> 01:13:57,985
What made you choose the two of us?

915
01:13:58,548 --> 01:14:01,877
I did not choose you, you just happened to land here.

916
01:14:02,758 --> 01:14:04,127
Kray has to be stopped.

917
01:14:04,301 --> 01:14:06,220
But I could not do anything on my own,

918
01:14:06,629 --> 01:14:08,962
then out of nowhere you two showed up.

919
01:14:09,098 --> 01:14:12,070
It seems mankind still has luck on its side.

920
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:14,650
Yeah, but what would you have done if no one showed up?

921
01:14:14,777 --> 01:14:17,390
I suppose, Kray's plan would've doomed the Earth.

922
01:14:17,690 --> 01:14:18,967
What's this guy's deal?

923
01:14:19,273 --> 01:14:21,392
I am not a guy, I am a computer.

924
01:14:21,485 --> 01:14:23,892
And now the fate of planet Earth is in your hands.

925
01:14:24,104 --> 01:14:26,282
My work here is done. Deus out.

926
01:14:26,449 --> 01:14:28,399
What? Wait, Professor!

927
01:14:36,292 --> 01:14:38,473
So, are you feeling conflicted?

928
01:14:39,587 --> 01:14:40,904
Yeah, you probably are.

929
01:14:41,379 --> 01:14:43,807
You just found out your flames are aliens.

930
01:14:44,258 --> 01:14:46,053
What do you know about how I feel?

931
01:14:46,321 --> 01:14:48,191
Absolutely nothing, I guess.

932
01:14:48,262 --> 01:14:51,202
All I really know is that if there's a fire,
I'm putting it out.

933
01:14:51,282 --> 01:14:53,379
So you gotta do what you do and burn it out.

934
01:14:53,476 --> 01:14:54,341
I, what?

935
01:14:54,685 --> 01:14:58,522
Yeah, uphold your Burnish pride.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

936
01:15:00,164 --> 01:15:02,674
Yeah, let's do this.

937
01:15:02,985 --> 01:15:04,933
We'll save the Burnish and the Earth.

938
01:15:05,112 --> 01:15:06,653
I like your style!

939
01:15:13,829 --> 01:15:16,074
All systems check, ready for departure.

940
01:15:16,389 --> 01:15:18,824
Very good, start up the Prometech engine.

941
01:15:20,753 --> 01:15:24,074
Prometech engine, activate.

942
01:15:43,192 --> 01:15:43,672
That's...

943
01:15:44,057 --> 01:15:44,982
The warp gate.

944
01:15:45,402 --> 01:15:46,982
Keep going, Dr. Heris.

945
01:15:47,321 --> 01:15:50,232
Watch as we open the door to mankind's future.

946
01:15:50,601 --> 01:15:52,296
What the heck is that?

947
01:15:53,371 --> 01:15:54,089
What was that?

948
01:15:54,113 --> 01:15:58,541
This makes no sense.
Volcanoes are erupting simultaneously all over the world.

949
01:16:10,052 --> 01:16:11,797
At long last.

950
01:16:12,763 --> 01:16:14,797
Large unidentified machine approaching.

951
01:16:15,057 --> 01:16:16,593
It's not responding to hails.

952
01:16:17,176 --> 01:16:20,356
Impossible, attack with all weapons!

953
01:16:21,287 --> 01:16:22,240
Fire freezing missiles!

954
01:16:22,313 --> 01:16:24,289
Use conventional weapons as well!

955
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:26,474
That's an order, fire!

956
01:16:39,707 --> 01:16:42,207
Collision on deck, the target has stopped.

957
01:16:42,877 --> 01:16:43,547
Is it dead?

958
01:16:45,347 --> 01:16:47,857
That hurt, what the hell are you doing?

959
01:16:47,882 --> 01:16:49,542
You're supposed to be piloting this thing!

960
01:16:49,659 --> 01:16:50,890
Man, I'm sorry.

961
01:16:51,093 --> 01:16:53,108
For some reason, I just can't get in the zone.

962
01:16:53,179 --> 01:16:54,267
What are you talking about?

963
01:16:54,362 --> 01:16:58,480
This suit, it just, I mean, look how lame the design is.

964
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,948
I can't get my firefighter's soul to burn in this thing!

965
01:17:01,019 --> 01:17:03,671
This is the crap I get after you insist I come out here?

966
01:17:04,030 --> 01:17:06,949
Well, we cant sit here, how about this?

967
01:17:08,742 --> 01:17:10,037
Oh, yeah, good call.

968
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:12,654
That's what I'm talkin about!

969
01:17:12,752 --> 01:17:14,781
This is my jam!

970
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,843
That thing's showing an extremely powerful Burnish signal.

971
01:17:18,078 --> 01:17:21,160
According to these readings,
it's more pure than the Prometech engine.

972
01:17:23,446 --> 01:17:25,446
<i><b>NEXUS</b></i>

973
01:17:27,463 --> 01:17:33,503
Even if the ideals you look up to come crashing
to the ground, your hope will never be broken.

974
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:41,284
A burning firefighter and an ice-cold firestarter,
oil and water combined as one!

975
01:17:41,602 --> 01:17:45,987
Absolute Firefighter, Lio dé Galon!

976
01:17:46,092 --> 01:17:47,377
LIO DE GALON

977
01:17:47,483 --> 01:17:55,741
We'll extinguish every last fire on Earth!

978
01:17:57,489 --> 01:17:59,326
What the hell are you talking about?

979
01:17:59,433 --> 01:18:02,327
"Deus X whatever" doesn't really have enough impact.

980
01:18:02,456 --> 01:18:04,765
Its new name is Lio dé Galon.

981
01:18:04,917 --> 01:18:08,287
Gotta love my modesty, I could've called it Galo dé Lion.

982
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,838
Shut up and fight.

983
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:14,301
I knew it, that machine is the Deus X Machina.

984
01:18:15,004 --> 01:18:16,753
I didn't know it was completed.

985
01:18:17,458 --> 01:18:24,006
Hyper Fire Safety Punch!

986
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:29,253
That voice, is that Galo?

987
01:18:29,290 --> 01:18:30,016
Sure was.

988
01:18:30,099 --> 01:18:31,383
What is he doing?

989
01:18:31,482 --> 01:18:36,524
Where did he find it, where did it come from?
I need answers!

990
01:18:36,959 --> 01:18:39,821
What the hell is going on, Galo?

991
01:18:43,688 --> 01:18:46,466
Heris, do you read me? Come in, it's me, Aina.

992
01:18:46,688 --> 01:18:48,537
Aina, where have you been?

993
01:18:48,752 --> 01:18:51,286
I'm fine, but more importantly, look at this.

994
01:18:51,874 --> 01:18:55,819
If you start the Prometech engine,
the Earth's core is going to go out of control!

995
01:18:56,385 --> 01:18:58,075
You cannot launch that ship!

996
01:18:58,170 --> 01:18:59,587
Isn't that Professor Deus?

997
01:18:59,694 --> 01:19:00,970
The governor killed him?

998
01:19:01,876 --> 01:19:03,424
This footage is...

999
01:19:04,035 --> 01:19:07,043
It's only a video, they're easily falsified.

1000
01:19:07,146 --> 01:19:09,310
Do not let the rebels tricks get to you.

1001
01:19:10,524 --> 01:19:11,874
Is what I'm seeing real?

1002
01:19:12,518 --> 01:19:14,551
Did the governor really murder Professor Deus?

1003
01:19:14,603 --> 01:19:16,767
He did, Deus told me himself.

1004
01:19:17,156 --> 01:19:19,290
Anyway, Kray's engine is incomplete.

1005
01:19:19,533 --> 01:19:22,766
If it fully activates, at this rate,
the earth'll become a sea of...

1006
01:19:23,704 --> 01:19:25,449
Aina, Aina?

1007
01:19:25,923 --> 01:19:28,709
You shut off my external communications didn't you?

1008
01:19:28,959 --> 01:19:32,838
No, it wasn't me.
An attack from that robot must've been the cause.

1009
01:19:33,634 --> 01:19:38,393
Killer move, One Match Arson Kick!

1010
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:42,415
Kick, Kick, Kick, Kick!

1011
01:19:42,848 --> 01:19:46,001
Hey, Burnish prisoners, where are you? We're here!

1012
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:47,823
Everyone, hold on!

1013
01:19:48,099 --> 01:19:50,284
Heris, the robot is insignificant.

1014
01:19:50,439 --> 01:19:53,208
Now set the engine to full power, we're warping at once.

1015
01:19:53,233 --> 01:19:55,156
Don't you care what happens to the planet?

1016
01:19:55,209 --> 01:19:57,727
It'll be destroyed sooner or later either way.

1017
01:19:57,952 --> 01:20:00,039
Concentrate on the migration project.

1018
01:20:00,449 --> 01:20:02,813
You, you knew, didn't you?

1019
01:20:03,102 --> 01:20:06,175
That using the Prometech engine would destroy the planet?

1020
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:09,124
It's either now or in six months.

1021
01:20:10,542 --> 01:20:12,991
I, understand.

1022
01:20:14,772 --> 01:20:17,345
Prometech engine, full power.

1023
01:20:26,683 --> 01:20:28,493
Oh no, they're about to warp!

1024
01:20:29,039 --> 01:20:29,953
Damn it!

1025
01:20:34,990 --> 01:20:37,479
Tell me, where are the Burnish?!

1026
01:20:38,112 --> 01:20:40,992
We have to abort. They're going to destroy the bridge!

1027
01:20:43,408 --> 01:20:45,710
All personnel move to the second bridge.

1028
01:20:45,786 --> 01:20:49,123
Transfer the ship's main system controls
to the secondary bridge as well.

1029
01:20:50,830 --> 01:20:52,939
I'll get rid of that thing.

1030
01:20:53,085 --> 01:20:55,714
Biar, take control of the launch procedures.

1031
01:20:56,489 --> 01:20:57,211
Yes, sir.

1032
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:04,707
Galo, you're pushing your luck!

1033
01:21:09,501 --> 01:21:10,798
Huh, what's that?

1034
01:21:11,228 --> 01:21:13,066
Your futile struggle..

1035
01:21:14,565 --> 01:21:18,253
is now over!

1036
01:21:30,694 --> 01:21:33,246
That voice, it's Kray!

1037
01:21:33,527 --> 01:21:35,752
Kray, free the Burnish!

1038
01:21:36,916 --> 01:21:39,493
Filthy terrorists, how dare you?

1039
01:21:53,811 --> 01:21:54,479
What?

1040
01:21:54,586 --> 01:21:56,677
The buildings, they turned into dirt!

1041
01:21:56,890 --> 01:21:59,056
Genocide Cultivation Beam,

1042
01:21:59,142 --> 01:22:01,820
it destroys mountains, turning them into farmland.

1043
01:22:02,321 --> 01:22:05,646
Just one of the terraforming tools
we'll use on our new planet.

1044
01:22:05,932 --> 01:22:08,099
I wasn't expecting to have to use it here.

1045
01:22:08,226 --> 01:22:10,242
Hey, what about the people inside?

1046
01:22:10,345 --> 01:22:13,017
They're all in underground shelters, obviously.

1047
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:18,282
Damn you!

1048
01:22:19,788 --> 01:22:24,104
If you can make things like that, why didn't you
use your science to get the magma under control?

1049
01:22:24,182 --> 01:22:27,286
I tried and I couldn't,
that's why we were forced to migrate!

1050
01:22:27,397 --> 01:22:29,514
Do you really wanna destroy mankind?

1051
01:22:31,642 --> 01:22:35,350
If you already know it's gonna be destroyed
then you just have to stop it!

1052
01:22:35,529 --> 01:22:38,561
You can think about the rest later!

1053
01:22:39,029 --> 01:22:41,526
You hopeless idiot!

1054
01:23:16,812 --> 01:23:19,850
I'm not gonna let you commit any more atrocities.

1055
01:23:20,399 --> 01:23:24,258
Our Lio Dé Galon versus your Krazor X!

1056
01:23:24,653 --> 01:23:26,150
KRAZOR X

1057
01:23:26,571 --> 01:23:29,400
Time to find out which one's more powerful!

1058
01:23:29,908 --> 01:23:30,531
Lio!

1059
01:23:30,654 --> 01:23:31,304
Got it!

1060
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:53,860
So you stopped Lio Dé Galon's flames.

1061
01:23:54,141 --> 01:23:56,221
Most impressive, Krazor X.

1062
01:23:56,511 --> 01:23:57,667
BUT NOW,

1063
01:24:01,103 --> 01:24:04,389
TAKE THIS, Krazor X!

1064
01:24:09,156 --> 01:24:09,980
STOP,

1065
01:24:11,616 --> 01:24:12,730
MAKING UP,

1066
01:24:14,411 --> 01:24:16,330
STUPID NAMES!

1067
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:24,588
Pulverizing Pile Driver,

1068
01:24:25,225 --> 01:24:28,627
designed to break through hard
bedrock to reach water veins.

1069
01:24:28,925 --> 01:24:32,684
Compared to this, your armor is nothing, like paper!

1070
01:24:52,417 --> 01:24:53,924
That robot's bad news.

1071
01:24:53,949 --> 01:24:56,715
I know, no way can we win like this.

1072
01:24:56,995 --> 01:24:59,768
Dammit, wish I had my Matoi gear.

1073
01:24:59,831 --> 01:25:03,602
Matoi, that weird costume you were wearing before?

1074
01:25:03,659 --> 01:25:04,821
It's not weird, it's cool!

1075
01:25:04,961 --> 01:25:08,023
It embodies the firefighter heritage
of a far-off island nation!

1076
01:25:08,071 --> 01:25:09,692
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

1077
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:26,585
Something like this?

1078
01:25:30,112 --> 01:25:31,863
Bring it on!

1079
01:25:36,243 --> 01:25:39,910
Nothing in the world gets me fired up like Matoi!

1080
01:25:46,157 --> 01:25:51,788
Gaze in awe, Lio Dé Galon, Matoi Decked out!

1081
01:25:54,694 --> 01:25:55,297
What?

1082
01:25:59,891 --> 01:26:00,723
Heris...

1083
01:26:03,937 --> 01:26:07,645
Doctor, the engine is out of control
because it's being over-fueled!

1084
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:10,134
At this rate, the central pod is going to overheat!

1085
01:26:10,193 --> 01:26:12,650
If we don't do something is gonna explode!

1086
01:26:31,809 --> 01:26:33,460
Heris, what's going on?

1087
01:26:34,551 --> 01:26:37,385
I've destroyed the central pod
by overloading it with energy.

1088
01:26:37,971 --> 01:26:40,133
The Prometech engine is now inoperable.

1089
01:26:40,932 --> 01:26:43,024
You did this, intentionally?

1090
01:26:43,179 --> 01:26:45,599
I was a fool to have ever believed in you, Kray.

1091
01:26:47,089 --> 01:26:51,067
That idiot, she's been blinded by her love for her sister.

1092
01:26:52,366 --> 01:26:54,279
Call Colonel Vulcan at once.

1093
01:26:56,064 --> 01:27:00,298
Ow, it looks like the Parnassus just crashed.

1094
01:27:00,357 --> 01:27:02,324
The warp gate must have closed, that means...

1095
01:27:05,504 --> 01:27:07,741
The death of the Earth is now inevitable.

1096
01:27:08,464 --> 01:27:12,067
This ship and its passengers the only future for mankind.

1097
01:27:12,589 --> 01:27:16,211
And it's Kray Foresight who'll create that future!

1098
01:27:27,223 --> 01:27:29,967
Absolute Zero Heat Death Cannon.

1099
01:27:30,482 --> 01:27:32,217
It's the ultimate freezing weapon,

1100
01:27:32,593 --> 01:27:37,447
created for protection from Promare
attacks and solar flares on our new planet.

1101
01:27:37,572 --> 01:27:41,222
If you've got something like that,
why don't you use it to save Earth?

1102
01:27:41,317 --> 01:27:44,015
You'd have to be inside the planet core for that to work.

1103
01:27:44,507 --> 01:27:47,123
This machine couldn't withstand those conditions.

1104
01:27:47,752 --> 01:27:50,031
You just want to migrate no matter what.

1105
01:27:50,435 --> 01:27:52,703
If you bothered to cool off you'd see that.

1106
01:27:53,129 --> 01:27:56,453
Do you two idiots really think you can beat me?

1107
01:27:57,217 --> 01:28:00,464
I'll send you to absolute freezing hell!

1108
01:28:02,542 --> 01:28:04,939
Galo, you didn't even try to dodge that!

1109
01:28:05,479 --> 01:28:07,137
What are you planning to do?

1110
01:28:07,162 --> 01:28:09,558
Just grin, and bear it, that's all!

1111
01:28:09,646 --> 01:28:11,429
You're an idiot!

1112
01:28:11,723 --> 01:28:15,807
Yeah, the world's number-one firefighting idiot!

1113
01:28:16,069 --> 01:28:17,656
I'm gonna put 'em out now.

1114
01:28:17,988 --> 01:28:21,394
Not only your flames but your stupid ambitions too!

1115
01:28:21,506 --> 01:28:23,780
Okay, let's do it!

1116
01:28:23,994 --> 01:28:28,912
I dare you to come and take your best shot!

1117
01:28:51,563 --> 01:28:52,781
Did we get him?

1118
01:28:53,102 --> 01:28:54,492
Wait, look.

1119
01:28:55,706 --> 01:28:59,475
Does saving the Burnish mean that much to you, Lio Fotia?

1120
01:28:59,816 --> 01:29:02,178
Guess what, you're going to fail.

1121
01:29:02,491 --> 01:29:05,110
Because the Burnish are destined to die.

1122
01:29:05,368 --> 01:29:09,998
Listen, listen to the death throes of your friends!

1123
01:29:14,335 --> 01:29:15,240
Bastard!

1124
01:29:15,366 --> 01:29:20,386
If you hate me so much, then kill me, Lio Fotia, do it!

1125
01:29:20,585 --> 01:29:24,001
Be careful what you wish for, Kray!

1126
01:29:24,627 --> 01:29:27,588
Stop it, calm down, Lio, don't kill him!

1127
01:29:29,809 --> 01:29:33,624
I will never, forgive you!

1128
01:29:39,569 --> 01:29:42,196
Did you really think you'd be able to burn me...

1129
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,325
with your pathetic flames?

1130
01:29:46,576 --> 01:29:49,418
You Burnish really are just a bunch of fools.

1131
01:29:49,538 --> 01:29:50,181
What?

1132
01:29:50,333 --> 01:29:51,912
Impossible, are you...

1133
01:29:51,998 --> 01:29:59,127
Ah, indeed. I was cursed with the
same mutation, that's why I understand.

1134
01:29:59,422 --> 01:30:05,049
Yes, I understand how difficult it is
to have a strong enough will to control the flames,

1135
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:09,549
as well as to control the urge to burn
everything to the ground.

1136
01:30:09,753 --> 01:30:12,682
The Burnish live under the control of the Promare.

1137
01:30:12,894 --> 01:30:15,831
They're nothing but slaves to their instincts!

1138
01:30:16,606 --> 01:30:19,041
You make it sound like you're any different.

1139
01:30:19,164 --> 01:30:22,026
That's because I am!

1140
01:30:23,196 --> 01:30:24,563
Don't even try,

1141
01:30:24,655 --> 01:30:28,103
my Burnish power is far greater than yours will ever be.

1142
01:30:28,468 --> 01:30:28,876
Damn it.

1143
01:30:28,901 --> 01:30:34,100
But still, as long as I have you,
I can harness your power to restart my Prometech engine.

1144
01:30:34,207 --> 01:30:36,322
You'll be the engine's core now.

1145
01:30:36,418 --> 01:30:37,021
What?

1146
01:30:37,342 --> 01:30:38,837
I thank you.

1147
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,254
Let him go now, Kray.

1148
01:30:43,798 --> 01:30:45,005
Good grief.

1149
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:53,657
From the very moment we met, I've hated the sight of you.

1150
01:30:54,310 --> 01:30:57,627
I had my first Burnish spasm when I was a student.

1151
01:30:58,222 --> 01:31:01,158
I was trying to hold back the flames, but I couldn't.

1152
01:31:01,568 --> 01:31:04,605
So, you're saying that you didn't save me?

1153
01:31:05,098 --> 01:31:07,764
No, it was a complete accident.

1154
01:31:08,391 --> 01:31:11,870
But it was a good opportunity to build my reputation.

1155
01:31:13,048 --> 01:31:14,270
No way.

1156
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:19,085
I had you placed in Burning Rescue
because it was the job with the highest mortality rate.

1157
01:31:19,512 --> 01:31:24,734
I wanted to be rid of you, but you kept surviving,
and you kept coming back!

1158
01:31:25,341 --> 01:31:30,465
My life has always gone according to plan,
except when it comes to you.

1159
01:31:31,404 --> 01:31:33,882
You're not just an idiot, you're a cancer!

1160
01:31:34,409 --> 01:31:36,715
You were, my hero!

1161
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:38,933
But this is the end for you!

1162
01:31:39,189 --> 01:31:40,308
Galo!

1163
01:31:52,574 --> 01:31:54,161
You're a monster!

1164
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:55,179
No...

1165
01:31:57,707 --> 01:31:59,621
I am a hero!

1166
01:32:00,369 --> 01:32:03,277
The savior of mankind!

1167
01:32:20,942 --> 01:32:23,518
Nowhere left to run.

1168
01:32:25,717 --> 01:32:30,365
You know that wasn't very smart of you,
turning against the governor.

1169
01:32:36,932 --> 01:32:39,368
She'd rather jump than face me.

1170
01:32:42,293 --> 01:32:42,948
What?

1171
01:32:43,837 --> 01:32:45,842
You cheeky bastards!

1172
01:32:50,969 --> 01:32:51,584
Aina!

1173
01:32:51,659 --> 01:32:52,508
We made it!

1174
01:32:52,755 --> 01:32:54,519
Let's go get Galo.

1175
01:33:01,059 --> 01:33:02,397
Galo!

1176
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:08,806
The Burnish are inside these pods surrounding us.

1177
01:33:09,112 --> 01:33:14,706
You'll fly us across the stars,
powered by the Burnish's screams.

1178
01:33:14,951 --> 01:33:16,948
You shall become a legend.

1179
01:33:17,954 --> 01:33:21,289
An undeserved distinction for a Burnish fool.

1180
01:33:21,408 --> 01:33:23,122
You won't get away with this.

1181
01:33:27,088 --> 01:33:29,790
That's right, go on, get angry.

1182
01:33:30,452 --> 01:33:33,695
All your rage will be fuel for my Prometech engine!

1183
01:33:35,236 --> 01:33:38,097
This is Kray, restart the countdown now.

1184
01:33:38,141 --> 01:33:39,868
We warp in five minutes.

1185
01:33:39,985 --> 01:33:41,116
Understood.

1186
01:33:41,853 --> 01:33:44,230
Parnassus, five minutes to warp.

1187
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:47,456
Galo, Galo!

1188
01:33:47,829 --> 01:33:49,027
He's still on fire!

1189
01:33:50,945 --> 01:33:51,421
Wait.

1190
01:33:59,321 --> 01:34:00,408
Are you okay?

1191
01:34:00,830 --> 01:34:02,353
Yeah.

1192
01:34:03,313 --> 01:34:05,190
Lio's flames protected me.

1193
01:34:08,598 --> 01:34:10,408
The ship, it's gonna warp.

1194
01:34:10,559 --> 01:34:12,102
How? I destroyed the engine.

1195
01:34:12,342 --> 01:34:14,517
He's using Lio to replace the core.

1196
01:34:14,868 --> 01:34:16,504
Doctor, where's the engine?

1197
01:34:16,884 --> 01:34:18,050
What are you gonna do?

1198
01:34:18,166 --> 01:34:20,239
Isn't it obvious? I'm gonna save Lio.

1199
01:34:20,334 --> 01:34:24,543
I'd ask how, but I know your plan
is to just run head-first into the core, isn't it?

1200
01:34:25,021 --> 01:34:27,605
Yeah, I'm a Burning Rescue member.

1201
01:34:27,748 --> 01:34:30,043
Firefighting and rescue is what I do.

1202
01:34:30,216 --> 01:34:32,537
I'm gonna save Lio and extinguish the...

1203
01:34:34,364 --> 01:34:40,578
Ignis, hand over the doctor and that punk,
or I'll consider you a traitor as well.

1204
01:34:40,641 --> 01:34:41,410
Not gonna happen.

1205
01:34:41,439 --> 01:34:44,549
You've got some balls defying the Freeze Force, Ignis.

1206
01:34:44,644 --> 01:34:48,047
This is an emergency situation, we're authorized to fight.

1207
01:34:48,197 --> 01:34:51,056
Doesn't matter, you're all gonna get burned!

1208
01:34:51,127 --> 01:34:52,290
I refuse!

1209
01:34:53,841 --> 01:34:54,522
Lucia!

1210
01:34:54,547 --> 01:34:55,602
Aye-aye, Captain!

1211
01:34:58,246 --> 01:35:02,885
I installed new drill gear on the spare Matoi,
just in case, 'cause you never know.

1212
01:35:04,477 --> 01:35:05,456
A new drill?

1213
01:35:05,561 --> 01:35:08,356
Yup, the drill of your dreams can penetrate any armor!

1214
01:35:08,381 --> 01:35:10,814
Also, I sent you a schematic of the Parnassus.

1215
01:35:10,926 --> 01:35:13,773
I'll calculate the angle
and launch you straight into the engine.

1216
01:35:14,101 --> 01:35:15,227
Nice, Lucia.

1217
01:35:16,699 --> 01:35:19,674
Skip the silly announcements, just get going!

1218
01:35:19,699 --> 01:35:20,485
Go get 'em!

1219
01:35:29,721 --> 01:35:31,379
I'm coming, Lio!

1220
01:35:39,666 --> 01:35:40,674
This is...

1221
01:35:59,870 --> 01:36:01,471
Vulcan!

1222
01:36:01,593 --> 01:36:03,224
Ignis!

1223
01:36:09,839 --> 01:36:12,166
How long is this gonna go on?

1224
01:36:12,462 --> 01:36:15,154
Me thinks there's a good chance
that we've run out of time!

1225
01:36:15,264 --> 01:36:17,037
Promare activity has increased.

1226
01:36:17,175 --> 01:36:17,942
Galo.

1227
01:36:47,954 --> 01:36:50,748
Lio!

1228
01:37:01,636 --> 01:37:04,430
Lio! Lio, are you okay?

1229
01:37:06,766 --> 01:37:07,718
Oh, no!

1230
01:37:14,475 --> 01:37:15,944
Why are you still alive?

1231
01:37:16,096 --> 01:37:17,652
Why can't I get rid of you?

1232
01:37:17,746 --> 01:37:20,190
This is a rescue operation, back off!

1233
01:37:20,215 --> 01:37:21,659
I'll extinguish you.

1234
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:26,380
No, extinguishing is my job!

1235
01:37:28,845 --> 01:37:31,400
Give up, you can't beat me!

1236
01:37:40,653 --> 01:37:41,296
What?

1237
01:37:41,874 --> 01:37:43,860
<b><i>Gallant Ones</i></b>

1238
01:38:07,519 --> 01:38:09,008
It's just like before.

1239
01:38:09,543 --> 01:38:12,430
Lio's fire protected me from those flames of yours.

1240
01:38:12,781 --> 01:38:14,667
This little spark was my shield.

1241
01:38:16,475 --> 01:38:19,879
Now here's what I'm gonna do, save him, save Earth,

1242
01:38:20,030 --> 01:38:21,420
and even save you!

1243
01:38:21,703 --> 01:38:23,052
Save me?

1244
01:38:31,726 --> 01:38:33,429
Just shut up and watch.

1245
01:38:37,773 --> 01:38:39,761
Hey, bud, stay with me!

1246
01:38:40,073 --> 01:38:46,157
Lio, come on, dammit, don't you disappear on me!

1247
01:38:48,409 --> 01:38:49,620
I've gotta do something.

1248
01:39:25,443 --> 01:39:26,781
G...Galo?

1249
01:39:28,264 --> 01:39:30,391
Hey, you're awake, welcome back.

1250
01:39:31,335 --> 01:39:33,548
Did, did you just save me?

1251
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:38,990
What have I done?

1252
01:39:39,043 --> 01:39:42,629
For the first time in my whole life,
I lit a fire, because of you!

1253
01:39:42,662 --> 01:39:44,217
This is all your fault!

1254
01:39:44,279 --> 01:39:46,473
How are you gonna fix this, you jerk!

1255
01:39:47,362 --> 01:39:50,414
How about you and I burn the Earth to the ground?

1256
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:52,932
When I was in the pod,

1257
01:39:52,957 --> 01:39:54,981
I synced with the Promare in the Earth's core,

1258
01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:56,594
and I understand now.

1259
01:39:56,852 --> 01:39:58,675
Their combustion is incomplete.

1260
01:39:59,016 --> 01:40:01,203
We have to let them burn out just once.

1261
01:40:01,308 --> 01:40:02,692
Lio, have you lost your mind?

1262
01:40:02,807 --> 01:40:05,111
How could you even ask me, a firefighter, to do that?

1263
01:40:05,152 --> 01:40:08,076
That's why we need you, your firefighter's soul.

1264
01:40:08,507 --> 01:40:11,713
This time, let's call it Galo Dé Lion!

1265
01:40:16,458 --> 01:40:19,161
Wait, stop it, what are you doing?

1266
01:40:19,339 --> 01:40:22,109
I thought that would be obvious, we're going firefighting.

1267
01:40:22,253 --> 01:40:25,409
We'll extinguish the Earth's magma
and the flames of your ambition.

1268
01:40:28,968 --> 01:40:31,180
We'll need help from all the Burnish too!

1269
01:40:31,420 --> 01:40:34,633
With all of our flames we can ignite the whole planet!

1270
01:40:34,737 --> 01:40:36,062
You got it, boss.

1271
01:40:36,404 --> 01:40:37,935
Yeah, let's do this, boss!

1272
01:40:38,687 --> 01:40:41,930
Boss!

1273
01:40:44,984 --> 01:40:49,113
Now, I'll show you my burning firefighter's soul!

1274
01:40:49,254 --> 01:40:50,412
<b><i>Inferno</i></b>

01:40:50,447 --> 01:40:50,947
What?

1276
01:41:15,739 --> 01:41:17,668
Dammit, he didn't make it in time.

1277
01:41:17,823 --> 01:41:19,682
But these flames aren't...

1278
01:41:20,144 --> 01:41:22,049
Yeah, that's right.

1279
01:41:22,184 --> 01:41:23,247
They're not hot.

1280
01:41:23,272 --> 01:41:25,247
It's like what happened to Galo earlier.

1281

They're protecting us.

1282
01:41:35,284 --> 01:41:38,781
That's right, the Promare synched with human will.

1283
01:41:39,550 --> 01:41:42,845
When my desire to burn everything on Earth to the ground,

1284
01:41:42,870 --> 01:41:46,879
and my will, the will to save human lives from fire,

1285
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:48,005
when those desires...

1286
01:41:48,083 --> 01:41:49,134
Join as one.

1287
01:42:00,684 --> 01:42:02,999
GALO DE LION

1288
01:42:29,187 --> 01:42:32,675
Now our flames will burn out the entire Earth!

1289
01:42:32,778 --> 01:42:36,447
Total incineration of the entire planet Earth!

1290
01:42:36,826 --> 01:42:39,856
I'll extinguish you with my burning soul!

1291
01:44:04,803 --> 01:44:06,303
What did you do?

1292
01:44:06,644 --> 01:44:09,430
We satisfied the Promare's primal drive to burn.

1293
01:44:09,980 --> 01:44:13,484
We sent them back to their universe
and closed the dimensional rift.

1294
01:44:14,860 --> 01:44:16,436
There are no more Promare

1295
01:44:16,612 --> 01:44:19,114
and no more Burnish in this world anymore.

1296
01:44:21,017 --> 01:44:23,041
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

1297
01:44:28,999 --> 01:44:32,865
Whoo, yeah, what a blaze!

1298
01:44:33,671 --> 01:44:39,116
This is the beginning, a new beginning for this city.

1299
01:44:39,718 --> 01:44:41,615
Time to clean up after the fire.

1300
01:44:41,887 --> 01:44:43,847
Lio, you're gonna help too.

1301
01:44:44,335 --> 01:44:44,819
What?

1302
01:44:44,993 --> 01:44:48,081
We're low on manpower, so everyone's gotta do their part.

1303
01:44:48,256 --> 01:44:49,581
Let's get your friends to pitch in.

1304
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:50,327
Wait.

1305
01:44:50,521 --> 01:44:53,788
Don't worry. If anybody gives you heat, I'll put 'em out.

1306
01:44:54,019 --> 01:44:56,654
Through spark and flame, I got your back.

1307
01:44:59,277 --> 01:45:01,787
I swear, Galo, you really are an idiot.

1308
01:45:01,902 --> 01:45:07,053
Yeah, I'm the universe's number one firefighting idiot!

1309
01:45:11,369 --> 01:45:13,060
<i>Trails of fire</i>

1310
01:45:13,085 --> 01:45:14,457
<i>You always knew</i>

1311
01:45:14,482 --> 01:45:16,737
<i>They would carry me home</i>

1312
01:45:16,762 --> 01:45:19,067
<i>They'd lead me to you</i>

1313
01:45:19,662 --> 01:45:21,330
<i>Though you can't see the sun</i>

1314
01:45:21,449 --> 01:45:23,356
<i>A new day has begun</i>

1315
01:45:23,492 --> 01:45:25,137
<i>And I fall out of bed</i>

1316
01:45:25,162 --> 01:45:26,916
<i>To a siren call</i>

1317
01:45:27,313 --> 01:45:29,100
<i>In the frame on the wall</i>

1318
01:45:29,126 --> 01:45:30,713
<i>See you in fire</i>

1319
01:45:30,913 --> 01:45:32,563
<i>You guys are smiling at me</i>

1320
01:45:32,610 --> 01:45:34,416
<i>And you inspire</i>

1321
01:45:34,482 --> 01:45:38,389
<i>I down a coffee, grab my axe and then I'm out</i>

1322
01:45:38,469 --> 01:45:41,583
<i>I got a rage inside that's making me shout</i>

1323
01:45:41,661 --> 01:45:44,747
<i> get high on the fighting, you know</i>

1324
01:45:45,384 --> 01:45:49,137
<i>Inside my heart feelin' the inferno</i>

1325
01:45:49,162 --> 01:45:51,070
<i>Barely catchin' my breath</i>

1326
01:45:51,133 --> 01:45:53,064
<i>Lay my eyes on the crest</i>

1327
01:45:53,089 --> 01:45:56,926
<i>Gonna square up to all of the heat that is left</i>

1328
01:45:56,926 --> 01:46:00,888
<i>So, I carry the torch to inferno, inferno</i>

1329
01:46:00,930 --> 01:46:02,597
<i>It's out of the park</i>

1330
01:46:02,622 --> 01:46:04,289
<i>And I'm smilin' again</i>

1331
01:46:04,455 --> 01:46:05,480
<i>Here we go</i>

1332
01:46:05,591 --> 01:46:08,010
<i>I know, I know, I know, I know.</i>

1333
01:46:08,010 --> 01:46:10,262
<i>I will be here for you</i>

1334
01:46:10,262 --> 01:46:12,014
<i>Wherever you go</i>

1335
01:46:12,014 --> 01:46:13,340
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

<i>Trails of fire</i>

1341
01:46:21,919 --> 01:46:23,558
<i>You always knew</i>

1342
01:46:23,772 --> 01:46:25,615
<i>They would carry me home</i>

1343
01:46:25,732 --> 01:46:28,514
<i>They'd lead me to you</i>
