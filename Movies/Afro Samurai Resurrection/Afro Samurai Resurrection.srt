It's promise is power.

Omnipotence. Immortality.

But at what cost?
One that is greater than

any man can imagine,
and heavier than

Do you remember me?

00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:27,800
I remember you.

27
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,233
And all that you have done...

28
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:35,333
Murderer. Monster!

29
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:39,066
How many hundreds of
lives have you ended?

30
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:40,433
How many thousands have

31
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:44,500
you made mourn the loss
of their loved ones?

32
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,666
Now it's <i>your</i> turn.

33
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,400
I know the <i>one</i> thing
you care about.

34
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,133
And when I bring <i>him</i>
back from the dead‐‐

35
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:58,200
I'm going to toy
with him. Torture him.

36
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:13,300
Your father will
suffer the punishment

37
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,766
for <i>your</i> sins, Afro Samurai.

38
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:21,600
Unless, you find the
number 2 headband

39
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,600
and try to stop me.

40
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,566
Do you have the balls?

41
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:33,766
So go fetch boy!

42
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,366
Urgh!

43
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,100
Come for me, Afro Samurai.

44
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,233
With the No.1 headband
on my forehead,

45
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:59,233
you are bound by
your samurai code.

46
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:05,300
Take the bait, find the
number 2... come for me...

47
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:13,533
...so I can crush your heart and
body as you have crushed mine.

48
00:10:45,647 --> 00:10:48,066
Now don't we look like shit.

49
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:49,532
How you been, man?

50
00:10:49,532 --> 00:10:52,232
Ain't seen you in a while.

51
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:58,632
Ohhh, you gettin'
kinda old ain't ya?

52
00:10:58,632 --> 00:11:03,299
Look at this poor blade.
It's all jacked up.

53
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:07,032
Man, things sure have changed.

54
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:13,499
So how come you're not
wearing the No.1 headband? Huh?

55
00:11:14,432 --> 00:11:16,766
I've <i>had</i> my revenge.

56
00:11:16,766 --> 00:11:19,499
Ain't you learned nothin' yet?

57
00:11:19,499 --> 00:11:24,032
Whatever your reasons,
once you put on the headband,

58
00:11:24,032 --> 00:11:26,599
you can't never really escape...

59
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:28,099
(quickly jumping to a new topic)
But anyway...

60
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:30,166
How is that Teddy Bear
guy still alive?

61
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,532
Didn't you dead
him already? Guess not!

62
00:11:33,532 --> 00:11:39,466
Cause he on a strong rebound and
put much foot in your black ass!

63
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:43,332
Oooh! And didja catch that
honey he was ridin' with?

64
00:11:43,332 --> 00:11:46,532
She the new numero
uno now? Damn!

65
00:11:46,532 --> 00:11:49,199
She major bootylicious too!

66
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:52,332
She got ass for days, ya heard?!

67
00:11:52,332 --> 00:11:56,432
Even in that cold‐ass rain
she had me hot to trot!

68
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:09,166
It begins again.

69
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:13,432
Awight! Now that's
what I'm talkin' about!

70
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:16,432
We road dogs again! Hee hee!

71
00:12:16,432 --> 00:12:18,566

and ready‐to‐rumble!

73
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:41,066
Are you sure these fragments
of bone are enough?

74
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:45,166
Heh, heh, heh.
Please rest assured.

75
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:48,632
In two weeks we shall
be witness to a miracle.

76
00:12:48,632 --> 00:12:53,499
Sio‐‐ My heartfelt
gratitude for your

77
00:12:53,499 --> 00:12:56,599
generous help
with my experiments.

78
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:59,766
With the completion
of this ultimate being,

79
00:12:59,766 --> 00:13:04,599
we shall supersede
the power of GOD himself.

80
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:08,466
The world will be in our hands.

81
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:16,332
I shall be the one to decide how

82
00:13:16,332 --> 00:13:20,199
we use this "miracle,"
Professor Dharman.

83
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,566
And it is <i>you</i> who is helping US.

84
00:13:23,566 --> 00:13:25,499
Don't forget that.

85
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:31,666
(patronizingly)
My apologies,
your highness, Ms. Sio.

86
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:36,532
(with a snicker)
This is simply a perfect
coincidence of interests.

87
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:39,332
Please be assured
that I will use all

88
00:13:39,332 --> 00:13:42,399
of my resources
for your service,

89
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,232
my most noble
and beautiful lady Sio.

90
00:13:47,232 --> 00:13:49,266

Very wise of you.

91
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:52,466
Yes!

92
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:56,499
Setting of the restructuring
system is complete!

93
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:58,832
Hmm...

94
00:14:00,332 --> 00:14:05,699
You three, monitor Afro and
keep me posted on his moves.

95
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:07,999
Understood.

96
00:14:13,532 --> 00:14:17,266
The time is finally upon us.

97
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:19,232
All preparations have been made

98
00:14:19,232 --> 00:14:23,566
to get our revenge
on Afro Samurai.

99
00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:41,366
You're lookin' a
little refreshed now.

100
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:44,166
Course that didn't wipe
that pissed look off your face.

101
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,066
You know...

102
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:48,066
I mean to steal your
daddy's funky‐ass

103
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:50,632
remains in the
middle of a storm...

104
00:14:53,366 --> 00:14:54,599
That's just creepy, right?

105
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:57,299
All decomposed and shit.

106
00:14:57,299 --> 00:14:59,532
I mean, who does
that? For real?

107
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:01,566
But I'm feeling you!
This pissed you

108
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:03,166
off SO much,
that you gonna hit the

109
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:07,599
road again to find the
#2 headband AGAIN

110
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:11,732
just so you can
fight the #1 AGAIN?

111
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:21,532
All this just to get back your
daddy's nasty ass skull?

112
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:24,432
Hey man‐‐

113
00:15:24,432 --> 00:15:28,366
What's the big deal?
Give me the 411!

114
00:15:28,366 --> 00:15:33,266
I have no choice.
My father must rest in peace.

115
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,132
Can't you just leave
well enough alone?

116
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:09,766
(Thick Jamaican accent‐‐
spelling is phonetic)
Wise man say de state of de tang

117
00:16:09,766 --> 00:16:15,366
and blade of a sword iz a
reflection of a man's soul.

118
00:16:15,366 --> 00:16:18,699
Only de blade is
clean now, me bruder.

119
00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:22,166
De rest iz up to you.

120
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:42,366
Afro has begun to move.

121
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:44,399
Keep your eyes on him.

122
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:49,499
We don't gotta do this you know.

123
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:51,066
Come on, maybe
you oughta just chill?

124
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:52,199
Know what I mean?

125
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:56,332
Change over to menthols,

126
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:58,166
I mean check me out.

127
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:01,766
I'm happy cause
I smile all the time.

128
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:06,632
You don't never smile therefore
people don't LIKE you.

129
00:17:06,632 --> 00:17:08,132
I betcha even without any damn

130
00:17:08,132 --> 00:17:10,766
headband everybody still
gonna wanna fight you.

131
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:12,999
You just ain't no fun, bro!

132
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:16,132
You always focused
on killin' this guy

133
00:17:16,132 --> 00:17:18,066
and killin' that guy.

134
00:17:18,066 --> 00:17:20,266
How ya gonna pull a lady?

135
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:22,466
Yeah, well,
I‐I guess the strong silent

136
00:17:22,466 --> 00:17:27,032
types do always seem to get the
girls in the end and all but...

137
00:17:27,032 --> 00:17:28,732
Hold up, hold up, hold up!

138
00:17:28,732 --> 00:17:31,432
Wait a minute. You know,

139
00:17:31,432 --> 00:17:33,732
I just realized
this the first time

140
00:17:33,732 --> 00:17:36,699
I seen you without
the #2 headband!

141
00:17:36,699 --> 00:17:38,499
And you know what?

142
00:17:38,499 --> 00:17:41,399
You look kinda funny!

143
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:44,332
It's weird man!
I knew something was off!

144
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:47,732
I mean‐‐your
forehead's huge bro!

145
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:50,766
I thought your hair was big!
But damn!

146
00:17:50,766 --> 00:17:53,666
That's a
four‐times‐four‐times‐forehead!

147
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,232
That's what they mean when
they say headquarters!

148
00:17:56,232 --> 00:18:00,399
You're a big headliner!
A headmaster a‐‐

149
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:04,166
Shut up.

150
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:10,299
Oh, oh, oh... Now I remember.

151
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:13,666
The strong,
silent and sensitive type.

152
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:17,599
Hey‐‐ where we goin?

153
00:18:28,432 --> 00:18:31,232
Is it true?
He's heading this way?!

154
00:18:31,232 --> 00:18:33,132
Oh yeah. It's him!

155
00:18:33,132 --> 00:18:36,299
Can't forget those eyes.
That hair!

156
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:41,132
The cursed creature who
cut down JUSTICE at Mt. Shumi...

157
00:18:41,132 --> 00:18:44,599
...the demon who slaughtered
those we loved...

158
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:47,632
(excited with hate)
We can't let this
opportunity pass us by.

159
00:18:47,632 --> 00:18:49,599
Revenge will be ours!

160
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:51,166
I don't think we
can take him down.

161
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,699
He's too strong!

162
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,066
We... we're not ready yet!

163
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:56,499
There ain't enough of us!

164
00:18:56,499 --> 00:19:00,066
Come on! They say he hasn't
held his blade in years!

165
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:02,566
It's true! He's weak!

166
00:19:02,566 --> 00:19:06,766
Now is the only chance.
We strike now!

167
00:19:06,766 --> 00:19:09,566
Hey, how come you
guys know so much?

168
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:13,332
That lady over there,
she knows all about him.

169
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:15,299
None of you know nothin!!

170
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:17,299
What good is
killing him gonna do!?

171
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:19,666
Everything's already
gone to shit anyway!

172
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:20,866
You're wrong.

173
00:19:20,866 --> 00:19:24,132
It was after Afro Samurai
killed Justice that the world

174
00:19:24,132 --> 00:19:25,732
descended into chaos.

175
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:28,332
Men had always killed
for the headbands,

176
00:19:28,332 --> 00:19:32,332
but after Justice died and
Afro refused to replace him,

177
00:19:32,332 --> 00:19:35,332
men began to kill
for the joy of killing...

178
00:19:35,332 --> 00:19:38,666
That is when my husband fell...

179
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,632
Yo! He's coming!

180
00:19:40,632 --> 00:19:45,099
Yo! Afro Samurai is coming!

181
00:19:54,232 --> 00:19:54,932
Heh...

182
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:57,566
As Lady Sio had anticipated...

183
00:19:57,566 --> 00:20:02,599
Things are moving,
just as she planned.

184
00:20:05,732 --> 00:20:09,266
Yo Afro, you might need this.

185
00:20:20,732 --> 00:20:23,032
Y...Y... You murdered my father!

186
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:25,666
You murdered him!

187
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,599
You killed my only brother!

188
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,066
...and my best friend!

189
00:20:29,066 --> 00:20:32,099
This is for my dead son!

190
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:03,666
A curse on you demon!
You will burn in hell!

191
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:07,432
You will drown in the blood of
those innocents you have slain!

192
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,566
You will suffer
the endless bullets

193
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:13,999
and blades of all of us‐‐
Even after death!

194
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:18,399
Curse on you Afro Samurai!

195
00:21:34,432 --> 00:21:38,666
Ow! Snap! Now this
here is more like it!

196
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:41,699
Yo man, let me hold some gold!

197
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:26,532
The Afro Samurai is here.

198
00:22:26,532 --> 00:22:28,766
(over the intercom)
Send him in, won't you?

199
00:22:28,766 --> 00:22:30,532
OK now. Here's the plan.

200
00:22:30,532 --> 00:22:33,166
You... ummm... do somethin.

201
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,666
And uh...
I'm gonna get a lap dance

202
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:37,066
and meet you in
five minutes! Wowww!

203
00:22:37,066 --> 00:22:39,599
Hold up, noo, make that ten!

204
00:23:03,432 --> 00:23:05,699
Oideyasu.

205
00:23:10,732 --> 00:23:14,732
(Slowly)
The Number Two Headband.

206
00:23:14,732 --> 00:23:17,232
I am afraid
I cannot give you the

207
00:23:17,232 --> 00:23:21,566
location of the #2
headband for free.

208
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:25,032
But, If you can defeat me...

209
00:23:25,032 --> 00:23:26,632
(stopping Afro)
Oh no, no.

210
00:23:26,632 --> 00:23:32,532
Not by sword. We play these.

211
00:23:32,532 --> 00:23:37,332
If you win, I'll tell you
where to find the #2.

212
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:42,232
If I win, I have your head.

213
00:23:42,232 --> 00:23:45,166
Do we have a deal?

214
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:49,366
Escort Mr. Afro
to the gamblin' area.

215
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:58,266
Unlike you, Brother One,

216
00:23:58,266 --> 00:24:03,566
I only play games
that I know I will win.

217
00:24:03,566 --> 00:24:05,466
(stroking his beard)
Heh, heh, heh, heh....

218
00:24:10,963 --> 00:24:14,472
Now <i>that</i> was off da chizaiiiin!

219
00:24:14,472 --> 00:24:18,305
Yo Afro I got a
two‐for‐one dance, man!

220
00:24:18,305 --> 00:24:21,605
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Hey what'd I miss?

221
00:24:23,772 --> 00:24:26,572
Oh we gamblin now? Cool!

222
00:24:27,705 --> 00:24:30,739
Let us start the game!

223
00:24:30,739 --> 00:24:32,805
Bet on black! Oops!

224
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,872
Wrong game, heh heh heh heh!

225
00:24:39,572 --> 00:24:40,939
Call!

226
00:24:43,572 --> 00:24:45,939
Odd.

227
00:24:45,939 --> 00:24:47,505
Even...

228
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:52,739
Double ones! Even!

229
00:24:52,739 --> 00:24:55,605
(with a satisfied and
somewhat knowing look)
Afro Samurai, now that you've

230
00:24:55,605 --> 00:25:01,639
lost fair and square,
I must ask you to fulfill your‐‐

231
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:06,972
Fair?

232
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:14,572
That cheatin' son‐of‐a‐bitch!

233
00:25:14,572 --> 00:25:17,439
I want a free lap
dance behind dat!

234
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:22,039
(Slowly) The Number
Two Headband.

235
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:25,805
The No.2 is a ronin
named Shichogoro.

236
00:25:25,805 --> 00:25:30,539
He is in a village called
Machi‐City to the west...

237
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,905
Man... Couldn't we
have stayed a

238
00:25:34,905 --> 00:25:37,539
few more minutes
at that gamblin' house?

239
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:39,872
This shit is boring, man‐‐

240
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,605
You boring!

241
00:25:54,605 --> 00:26:00,372
The very demon of revenge
seeks divine guidance? Hah!

242
00:26:00,372 --> 00:26:01,839
Do you really think
you can absolve

243
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:07,705
yourself from sin by
sculpting stupid little toys?

244
00:26:07,705 --> 00:26:12,372
Whoa! Now that's some shit
you don't see every day.

245
00:26:12,372 --> 00:26:14,672
You've fallen so far...

246
00:26:14,672 --> 00:26:18,639
Coward. I've been watching you.

247
00:26:18,639 --> 00:26:22,672
Can you even raise your
sword against another?

248
00:26:22,672 --> 00:26:26,939
Where is the cold blooded
killer you once were?

249
00:26:26,939 --> 00:26:30,439
Do you no longer have
the stomach to fight?

250
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:35,439
Will you remain a coward,
even as your father suffers...?

251
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:37,672
Aw now that just ain't nice.

252
00:26:37,672 --> 00:26:39,939
You don't have
to listen to that shit.

253
00:26:39,939 --> 00:26:43,772
(taunting)
And you have such
a long long way to go...

254
00:26:43,772 --> 00:26:47,572
to save your
poor tortured father.

255
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,905
I've almost revived
his rotten bones.

256
00:26:49,905 --> 00:26:52,439
Oh, he <i>will</i> live again...

257
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:56,605
...to feel <i>pain</i>, to <i>suffer</i>.

258
00:26:56,605 --> 00:26:57,605
(mocking) And you
don't even have

259
00:26:57,605 --> 00:27:00,705
the #2 headband yet.

260
00:27:00,705 --> 00:27:02,539
So I have a few more days,

261
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:04,772
or maybe even weeks,

262
00:27:04,772 --> 00:27:07,572
to enjoy your father's
pain before you

263
00:27:07,572 --> 00:27:11,772
even have the right
to challenge me...

264
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:24,939
(slowly with anger)
Watch... your damn... mouth.

265
00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:32,272
Cause I'm comin' for my dad.

266
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:55,772
Then we comin' to get you bitch!

267
00:27:55,772 --> 00:28:01,872
Finally you are
awake my hated love.

268
00:28:01,872 --> 00:28:05,672
Now the fun begins...

269
00:28:05,672 --> 00:28:09,905
Whoa. She don't know
who she's fuckin' with.

270
00:28:21,505 --> 00:28:22,872
Jinno...

271
00:28:23,772 --> 00:28:26,305
At last, he has begun to move...

272
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:28,572
All is proceeding as planned.

273
00:28:28,572 --> 00:28:31,405
We will have our revenge.

274
00:28:31,405 --> 00:28:33,605
But, to succeed,
you and I, my love,

275
00:28:33,605 --> 00:28:37,839
must walk the path of demons.

276
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:42,939
I am truly sorry but it is the
only way to make him feel the

277
00:28:42,939 --> 00:28:47,505
eternal sadness
that we have felt,

278
00:28:47,505 --> 00:28:52,872
to make him suffer
as we have suffered.

279
00:28:52,872 --> 00:28:55,472
So please...

280
00:28:55,472 --> 00:28:57,639
...forgive me.

281
00:28:57,639 --> 00:29:04,805
Just remember that there
was no alternative.

282
00:29:04,805 --> 00:29:07,239
I will always love you...

283
00:29:08,805 --> 00:29:10,772
My beloved brother.

284
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,939
Your luck sucks, man.

285
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,872
Everybody knows this is the

286
00:29:36,872 --> 00:29:39,539
first day of the yearly
parade around here.

287
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:40,539
You ain't gonna get no info

288
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:44,472
from these party people
about that #2 headband.

289
00:29:44,472 --> 00:29:45,972
His name was Shichogoro right?

290
00:29:45,972 --> 00:29:49,472
You even got any idea
what he look like? I don't!

291
00:29:49,472 --> 00:29:52,772
How we even know that's
his real damn name?!?

292
00:30:01,972 --> 00:30:06,439
The point I am trying to make
is that this is all a bad idea!

293
00:30:13,639 --> 00:30:17,772
Help! Help! Help!

294
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:19,339
What the?

295
00:30:19,572 --> 00:30:20,972
Out of my way!

296
00:30:20,972 --> 00:30:23,272
A kidnappin' in broad daylight?

297
00:30:23,272 --> 00:30:25,372
That's a damn shame.

298
00:30:26,305 --> 00:30:30,572
(suddenly realizes)
Ah shit... Afro Samurai?

299
00:30:32,772 --> 00:30:34,572
‐‐Out of my way!
‐‐Whoa! Damn!

300
00:30:34,572 --> 00:30:37,472
I said move
you son of a bitch!!!

301
00:30:37,472 --> 00:30:41,772
Gun! Afro! Gun! Heater!
Rosco! Gat! Duck!

302
00:30:50,272 --> 00:30:51,639
Gahhh!!!!

303
00:31:02,005 --> 00:31:04,239
Waa! Waa!

304
00:31:09,605 --> 00:31:11,239
(Off‐screen) Kotaro!

305
00:31:17,939 --> 00:31:20,939
(crying) Oh Daddy!!

306
00:31:25,939 --> 00:31:30,305
Kotaro.
I told you to stay close.

307
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,739
I'm sorry...

308
00:31:35,905 --> 00:31:38,872
You. You have my thanks.

309
00:31:38,872 --> 00:31:41,605
(to the dead body) This
coward kidnapped my boy to...

310
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:44,872
(changes his mind) Forget it.

311
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:50,672
Let me buy you a drink...
(points with his thumb).

312
00:31:50,672 --> 00:31:52,705
...I know a spot nearby.

313
00:31:59,739 --> 00:32:02,972
Uh‐oh. I think I lost
a Ninja boot! Wait!

314
00:32:02,972 --> 00:32:06,439
I'm drowning! Hey! Afro!

315
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:08,472
Don't leave a brotha!

316
00:33:22,772 --> 00:33:24,905
I'm home old man!

317
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:29,772
Hey hey! You brought
a friend today?

318
00:33:29,772 --> 00:33:33,305
This man saved Kotaro'S life.

319
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:34,639
So maybe he's strong enough

320
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:37,372
not to die from
your stew ole man.

321
00:33:38,672 --> 00:33:40,939
Watch your mouth when
you talk about my oden

322
00:33:40,939 --> 00:33:45,539
Shichogoro, or you might
find a hot pepper in your bowl.

323
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:47,905
You call this crap oden? Ha!

324
00:33:47,905 --> 00:33:50,472
More like chunky rat poison!

325
00:33:50,472 --> 00:33:52,339
Anyway, give me and the kid two

326
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:56,705
of the usual and throw in
a couple cups of sake. Hot.

327
00:33:56,705 --> 00:33:58,505
Coming right up!

328
00:33:58,505 --> 00:34:00,639
(Happily)
Chunky rat poison!

329
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:05,739
Just for you,
you little street rat!

330
00:34:07,372 --> 00:34:09,339
You're the street rat!

331
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:22,305
Hey I'm back! Found my shoe too!

332
00:34:22,305 --> 00:34:25,639
Oh, ya getting' your
grub on? Oh, ewwww...

333
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,372
Somethin' smells funky!

334
00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:30,505
Oh shit! That's the dude!?!

335
00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:34,439
(smiling at Afro)
Whaddya have, partner?

336
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:37,472
Sukiyaki.

337
00:34:37,472 --> 00:34:39,005
Double that!

338
00:35:00,572 --> 00:35:02,305
Here's to you.

339
00:35:02,972 --> 00:35:05,605
Oh, not a drinker, eh?

340
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:08,339
Don't know what you're missin'!

341
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:09,872
Lemonade, then?

342
00:35:13,005 --> 00:35:15,605
Kidding. Kidding.

343
00:35:15,605 --> 00:35:18,672
(takes the bottle for himself.)
Forget it. I'll drink both.

344
00:35:24,005 --> 00:35:27,305
You aren't here for
the festival, are you..?

345
00:35:27,305 --> 00:35:30,005
Me neither.
Just passing through.

346
00:35:32,605 --> 00:35:35,405
But, I guess
we overstayed a bit.

347
00:35:37,339 --> 00:35:39,839
We had our chuckles
at the festival.

348
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,605
But, it's best we move on.

349
00:35:47,805 --> 00:35:50,705
Ya know, it sucks
that you gotta kill this dude.

350
00:35:50,705 --> 00:35:54,372
I gotta say, he ain't
so bad! Kinda cool...

351
00:36:09,405 --> 00:36:13,005
It's always lonely
after the festival.

352
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:15,672
At least this
is the last time I'll

353
00:36:15,672 --> 00:36:18,005
have to eat
your lousy rat poison!

354
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:22,605
You'll be sorry.
I make the best stew

355
00:36:22,605 --> 00:36:24,439
for miles around.
When you come back‐‐

356
00:36:24,439 --> 00:36:27,305
remind me to charge you double.

357
00:36:27,305 --> 00:36:31,705
Jeeeeesus! This is the best?

358
00:36:31,705 --> 00:36:35,339
Afro, maybe you oughta kill
this motha fucka too for lying.

359
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:37,272
This stew sucks!

360
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:43,705
Lemonade. Please. Help yourself.

361
00:36:52,972 --> 00:36:54,639
That guy earlier...

362
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:56,672
That man you cut down.

363
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:59,372
You want to know why
he tried to kidnap Kotaro?

364
00:36:59,372 --> 00:37:00,372
Hell, no.

365
00:37:00,372 --> 00:37:01,405
Do you want to know why anyone

366
00:37:01,405 --> 00:37:04,472
bothers with a street kid
and a drunk like me?

367
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,339
Hell, no.

368
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:06,605
(Trying to interrupt)
Shichogoro...

369
00:37:06,605 --> 00:37:08,639
It's OK, ole man.

370
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:10,372
Okay, tell us.

371
00:37:16,872 --> 00:37:19,905
I got something
everybody wants...

372
00:37:45,005 --> 00:37:46,939
One minute he's
stuffing his face,

373
00:37:46,939 --> 00:37:48,972
the next he's passed out.

374
00:37:48,972 --> 00:37:51,939
He ain't even mine.
He's an orphan‐‐

375
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:55,439
the son of a pal who
got himself murdered.

376
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:59,872
I promised to watch him if he
ever got in trouble or killed.

377
00:37:59,872 --> 00:38:03,739
Me and that old bastard
were like brothers.

378
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:07,839
He wasn't the brightest,
but he was a good man.

379
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,305
He died when this kid was a pup.

380
00:38:11,305 --> 00:38:15,005
I heard the man who killed
him had a weird look.

381
00:38:15,005 --> 00:38:17,839
An Afro hairdo with
a greenish tint

382
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,639
if you look real close.

383
00:38:21,605 --> 00:38:25,772
Now you listen to
me and you listen good.

384
00:38:25,772 --> 00:38:27,405
In this world,

385
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:31,005
there are bonds
deeper than blood...

386
00:38:32,505 --> 00:38:35,272
(Suddenly waking‐up)
Huh? Wha?

387
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:37,339
My pal, that dumb
son‐of‐a‐bitch,

388
00:38:37,339 --> 00:38:38,939
he was like so
many fools who went

389
00:38:38,939 --> 00:38:40,905
after those headbands of legend.

390
00:38:40,905 --> 00:38:44,405
All he wound‐up
was dead. (Pause)

391
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,005
Know what he said to me
when I found him dying?

392
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:53,939
"No more," he whispered.

393
00:38:53,939 --> 00:38:59,305
So, I got that #2 headband
myself and I hid it.

394
00:38:59,305 --> 00:39:02,305
Been on the run ever since.

395
00:39:12,772 --> 00:39:14,805
But now you've come...

396
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:31,639
(Looking at Afro)
...and now we're even.

397
00:39:33,005 --> 00:39:36,805
So, let's get this over with.

398
00:39:39,005 --> 00:39:42,505
(Enthusiastically)
Oh damn! It's ON now!

399
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:46,005
No more Mr. Nice Afro!

400
00:39:46,005 --> 00:39:47,739
Shichogoro...!

401
00:39:48,939 --> 00:39:51,772
(smiles) Keep that
poison hot ole man.

402
00:39:51,772 --> 00:39:53,805
I'll be back in a flash.

403
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:01,439
Hm...

404
00:40:33,235 --> 00:40:36,935
(chuckle)
I thought if Kotaro
and me just kept movin...

405
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,202
...maybe folks
would forget about

406
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:39,835
it all and I could
honor my pal's

407
00:40:39,835 --> 00:40:42,935
wish of peace for his son.

408
00:40:43,835 --> 00:40:49,535
But I guess there ain't
no hidin' from fate. Dammit.

409
00:40:49,535 --> 00:40:54,635
All these damn headbands do is
make dead buddies and orphans.

410
00:40:54,635 --> 00:40:56,769
You hear me Afro?

411
00:40:56,769 --> 00:41:00,235
Dead bodies and orphans!

412
00:41:00,235 --> 00:41:04,935
So, I ain't givin you
the #2 headband.

413
00:41:04,935 --> 00:41:08,102
You'll have to
kill me to get it.

414
00:41:08,102 --> 00:41:09,602
Not because I'm playin' by

415
00:41:09,602 --> 00:41:11,135
the headband rules,
and not because

416
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,102
I'm out to save
the world neither!

417
00:41:17,869 --> 00:41:21,669
Yo Afro! What's‐up
with the formal stance?

418
00:41:21,669 --> 00:41:24,535
He cool and all,
but he ain't your pal!

419
00:41:24,535 --> 00:41:26,469
Just dent this fool!

420
00:41:32,602 --> 00:41:36,035
It's because I keep my promises.

421
00:42:44,935 --> 00:42:48,802
Don't think I don't know
you Afro Samurai.

422
00:42:48,802 --> 00:42:51,935
I saw what you
did on the boardwalk.

423
00:42:51,935 --> 00:42:55,635
Killing a man without
a moment of hesitation‐‐

424
00:42:55,635 --> 00:43:00,169
like he was nothin'
but a fly on your face.

425
00:43:00,169 --> 00:43:04,569
Maybe it's time
someone swatted you.

426
00:43:04,569 --> 00:43:07,702
Maybe I feel like
I'm the guy to do it.

427
00:43:07,702 --> 00:43:09,669
You gonna let
him talk all that trash?

428
00:43:09,669 --> 00:43:12,135
Slice him and dice him, Afro!

429
00:43:18,069 --> 00:43:22,235
Sayonara Afro Samurai.

430
00:43:22,235 --> 00:43:23,869
Now that's just wack.

431
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:25,802
You gonna die creep!

432
00:43:37,802 --> 00:43:39,169
(painful grunt)
Guh!!!

433
00:44:12,902 --> 00:44:15,602
Shit! This guy's slick!

434
00:44:15,602 --> 00:44:19,769
I'm impressed! He just
might kill your ass!

435
00:44:47,902 --> 00:44:50,069
Aww man, you runnin?

436
00:44:50,069 --> 00:44:51,702
You makin' us look bad dude!

437
00:44:51,702 --> 00:44:53,602
Where you going?

438
00:45:05,835 --> 00:45:07,902
Ahhh, I knew you
was bein' devious!

439
00:45:07,902 --> 00:45:09,735
We ain't never run
from nobody,

440
00:45:09,735 --> 00:45:12,569
and we ain't about to
pick today to start running!

441
00:45:12,569 --> 00:45:14,269
Hey man! Keep on swingin'!

442
00:45:14,269 --> 00:45:16,202
Whilst I get my groove on!

443
00:45:16,202 --> 00:45:20,635
Let's paaaarrrttaaayyyy!

444
00:45:39,802 --> 00:45:43,502
Awwwwww shit!
Now we partyin' like rockstars!

445
00:45:43,502 --> 00:45:46,002
Light show! Light show!

446
00:45:46,002 --> 00:45:48,469
(pumping his voice to the beat)
Mmm... mmm!

447
00:46:13,969 --> 00:46:16,702
Bring it baby.

448
00:46:16,702 --> 00:46:19,835
Yeah, boom boom.

449
00:46:50,002 --> 00:46:51,269
Yeah yeah, whuddup yo!

450
00:46:51,269 --> 00:46:53,202
We're gonna get this party
crackin' right now!

451
00:46:53,202 --> 00:46:54,735
Now on center stage:

452
00:46:54,735 --> 00:46:56,902
we got the man with
the No.2 headband!

453
00:46:56,902 --> 00:46:58,535
Don't stop, get it, get it!

454
00:46:58,535 --> 00:47:01,069
Buzza buzza boom! Buzza boom!

455
00:47:27,002 --> 00:47:29,235
(Dropping his light sticks)
Hey! Where'd they come from?

456
00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:38,169
Urgh! This is only half‐cooked.

457
00:47:38,169 --> 00:47:39,669
You expect me to eat this?

458
00:47:39,669 --> 00:47:41,202
I broke my teeth on this crap.

459
00:47:41,202 --> 00:47:42,535
This is disgusting.

460
00:47:42,535 --> 00:47:44,035
How do you even
stay in business?

461
00:47:44,035 --> 00:47:45,602
Come on, let's get out of here.

462
00:47:45,602 --> 00:47:48,569
This place should be shut down.

463
00:47:53,702 --> 00:47:55,069
Dad...?

464
00:48:01,235 --> 00:48:02,802
Kotaro?

465
00:48:20,602 --> 00:48:24,135
Aww man!
You've killed the music!

466
00:48:24,135 --> 00:48:27,702
Why you always got to
wreck the party!?!

467
00:48:31,269 --> 00:48:35,935
Well, that was an
unnecessary distraction.

468
00:48:35,935 --> 00:48:38,035
Still want to die?

469
00:48:44,502 --> 00:48:46,669
You want it that much?

470
00:48:46,669 --> 00:48:49,569
It's just a piece
of cloth you idiot.

471
00:48:53,635 --> 00:48:59,569
If you're feeling so lucky‐‐
come and get it.

472
00:49:29,102 --> 00:49:30,135
What the fu... (reaction)

473
00:49:30,135 --> 00:49:31,869
Shut up.

474
00:50:30,535 --> 00:50:32,735
Sumanai.
("sorry" in samurai dialect)

475
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:22,689
Man you always got to
bust‐up the fun don't you.

476
00:51:22,689 --> 00:51:25,556
I was ravin' til the
break a dawn man!

477
00:51:25,556 --> 00:51:27,622
Light sticks and everything!

478
00:51:27,622 --> 00:51:29,422
Why'd you go and ruin it?

479
00:51:29,422 --> 00:51:31,156
I bet they even
cancel the damn thing

480
00:51:31,156 --> 00:51:33,456
next year and
its all your fault.

481
00:51:33,456 --> 00:51:36,656
And another thing...
you ain't all that,

482
00:51:36,656 --> 00:51:40,722
just cause you back
to being the #2 again!

483
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,222
Don't you get it?

484
00:51:42,222 --> 00:51:45,089
We walkin' the demon path again!

485
00:51:45,089 --> 00:51:47,122
It ain't the right way!

486
00:51:52,156 --> 00:51:54,622
Ah well. Whatever.
So where we goin' next?

487
00:51:54,622 --> 00:51:57,289
How about getting
a little 'push push' first?

488
00:51:57,289 --> 00:51:58,756
Know what I'm sayin'?!?!

489
00:51:58,756 --> 00:52:00,656
Man we never party!

490
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:08,056
Damn, now what's
fin to jump off?

491
00:52:15,356 --> 00:52:18,022
Whoa wait. Didn't they
already kick your ass?

492
00:52:18,022 --> 00:52:20,389
They coming after you again?

493
00:52:20,389 --> 00:52:24,289
Your blade stains
the world with blood.

494
00:52:24,289 --> 00:52:26,222
(sarcastic)
Oh you think!?

495
00:52:26,222 --> 00:52:29,589
You kill only for your
selfish petty reasons...

496
00:52:33,756 --> 00:52:35,722
Have you no heart?

497
00:52:50,089 --> 00:52:52,122
Uh... Urgh... Uh...

498
00:52:57,222 --> 00:52:58,522
(panicking)
This can't be real man.

499
00:52:58,522 --> 00:53:00,356
Who the hell are these people!

500
00:53:00,356 --> 00:53:02,256
This ain't possible!

501
00:53:04,489 --> 00:53:06,522
Grrrrrgggrgargagrgargggghhhh!!!

502
00:53:17,122 --> 00:53:19,156
I don't think so.

503
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:23,056
You should restrain yourself or

504
00:53:23,056 --> 00:53:27,056
risk another
humiliating beating.

505
00:53:27,056 --> 00:53:31,456
You don't want to risk
breaking my new toy do you?

506
00:53:31,456 --> 00:53:35,089
He's ever so fragile right now.

507
00:53:35,089 --> 00:53:38,122
Go to the Cherry Hill‐‐
or he dies again.

508
00:53:38,122 --> 00:53:44,356
But this time (slowly)
much much much more slowly.

509
00:53:46,422 --> 00:53:51,022
Watch... your damn... mouth!

510
00:53:52,656 --> 00:53:54,222
Bin!

511
00:53:55,089 --> 00:53:56,256
My lady!

512
00:53:56,256 --> 00:53:57,989
Step back.

513
00:54:14,422 --> 00:54:19,489
Um. Damn. You alright, man?

514
00:54:20,622 --> 00:54:22,356
NO!

515
00:54:41,722 --> 00:54:43,289
Jinno!

516
00:54:49,522 --> 00:54:53,256
Hey easy little sis!

517
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:55,622
It's been a long time,
hasn't it, Sio?

518
00:54:55,622 --> 00:54:58,256
How've you been, princess?

519
00:54:58,256 --> 00:54:59,456
Good!

520
00:54:59,456 --> 00:55:01,756
And our foster parents?
How are they?

521
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:03,722
They've been great!

522
00:55:03,722 --> 00:55:05,422
They're like real parents.

523
00:55:05,422 --> 00:55:07,256
And, they got this
guy named Bin-san.

524
00:55:07,256 --> 00:55:09,122
He's kinda strict and scary.

525
00:55:09,122 --> 00:55:10,756
And this other guy Michael‐san‐‐

526
00:55:10,756 --> 00:55:12,422
He plays with me lots.

527
00:55:12,422 --> 00:55:14,422
(excitedly)
Oh, oh, then this
lady Tomoe-san,

528
00:55:14,422 --> 00:55:17,389
teaches me to be
like a real princess!

529
00:55:17,389 --> 00:55:22,022
I even learned to dance and
have tea and everything!

530
00:55:23,256 --> 00:55:25,522
(Sincerely)
Wow. That's great.

531
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:29,089
(With a sad expression)
I wish you could
be here with me.

532
00:55:29,089 --> 00:55:32,422
(with a firm, yet loving voice)
I know little sister.
But you're safe here.

533
00:55:32,422 --> 00:55:33,656
This family wanted a daughter

534
00:55:33,656 --> 00:55:36,156
of their own to
replace the one they lost.

535
00:55:36,156 --> 00:55:39,222
Now I see they've
accepted you as their own.

536
00:55:39,222 --> 00:55:41,189
We should both be grateful.

537
00:55:41,189 --> 00:55:43,456
I'll try to visit more, OK?

538
00:55:45,722 --> 00:55:48,189
Hey there's someone
I want you to meet.

539
00:55:48,189 --> 00:55:51,589
This is Afro. Afro‐‐this
is Sio‐‐my sister.

540
00:55:51,589 --> 00:55:54,522
Oh! Hi Afro.

541
00:55:54,522 --> 00:55:56,456
Um. Hi.

542
00:55:56,456 --> 00:56:00,022
He's a newcomer at the sword
school. But he's real good‐‐

543
00:56:00,022 --> 00:56:01,689
almost as good as me!

544
00:56:01,689 --> 00:56:03,256
He's like a brother.

545
00:56:05,222 --> 00:56:06,456
Brother?

546
00:56:06,456 --> 00:56:07,589
Uh‐huh.

547
00:56:07,589 --> 00:56:12,289
(to Afro) So I guess that
makes you my brother too?

548
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:14,589
Umm.. Yeah I guess.

549
00:56:17,222 --> 00:56:18,756
Cool!

550
00:56:18,756 --> 00:56:20,756
I just got another brother!

551
00:56:20,756 --> 00:56:21,689
Yup.

552
00:56:21,689 --> 00:56:25,722
Can I see the sword
school someday too?

553
00:56:25,722 --> 00:56:28,622
Yeah. Sure. Anytime.

554
00:56:28,622 --> 00:56:33,356
You're shy.
And you're hair is funny!

555
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:35,989
Um... nice to meet you too...

556
00:57:00,989 --> 00:57:05,022
You will soon be free...

557
00:57:05,022 --> 00:57:08,756
You can't just toy with
science like that lady Sio!

558
00:57:08,756 --> 00:57:10,622
Are you mad!?!

559
00:57:10,622 --> 00:57:15,622
Once he's complete he could very
well be the ULTIMATE SAMURAI!

560
00:57:15,622 --> 00:57:17,522
But, if his growth
is interrupted‐‐

561
00:57:17,522 --> 00:57:23,289
he could end‐up just a
pile of worthless protein jelly!

562
00:57:23,289 --> 00:57:26,656
Mad? That's a
strange word coming

563
00:57:26,656 --> 00:57:29,656
from the very image of madness.

564
00:57:29,656 --> 00:57:33,489
But, our plans could
have been ruined!

565
00:57:33,489 --> 00:57:37,589
Ah, it's part of the
process dear professor.

566
00:57:37,589 --> 00:57:41,489
The more I taunt
Afro, the better.

567
00:57:41,489 --> 00:57:46,556
I want his suffering
to be long and slow.

568
00:57:46,556 --> 00:57:48,722
His death is not my goal‐‐

569
00:57:48,722 --> 00:57:52,056
only the final
exclamation point.

570
00:57:52,056 --> 00:57:55,156
Don't you know me by now?

571
00:57:57,222 --> 00:57:59,356
(stuttering)
Of course Lady Sio.

572
00:57:59,356 --> 00:58:01,689
You are truly twisted.

573
00:58:01,689 --> 00:58:06,356
But, it's j..just...
The risks...

574
00:58:06,356 --> 00:58:12,989
(laughter)
What a refreshing experience!

575
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,356
I've twisted the most twisted

576
00:58:15,356 --> 00:58:20,456
scientist in the world
with MY twistedness!

577
00:58:21,656 --> 00:58:25,056
Don't fear
my round friend.

578
00:58:25,056 --> 00:58:30,022
Everything is
moving so deliciously.

579
00:58:30,022 --> 00:58:32,489
Have a little faith!

580
00:58:34,256 --> 00:58:36,256
Yes, my Lady.

581
00:58:38,189 --> 00:58:40,989
With my guidance,
it won't end as badly

582
00:58:40,989 --> 00:58:45,056
as your failed masterpiece KUMA.

583
00:58:45,056 --> 00:58:46,456
(OS) Look at him.

584
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:47,722
You've repaired him so many

585
00:58:47,722 --> 00:58:51,322
times that there's
no human left at all.

586
00:58:51,322 --> 00:58:55,189
He's just a mindless
samurai doll.

587
00:58:55,189 --> 00:58:59,189
Soulless. Dead. (Pause)

588
00:58:59,189 --> 00:59:00,656
It disgusts you doesn't it?

589
00:59:00,656 --> 00:59:03,522
The failure‐‐I mean‐‐
the frustratingly

590
00:59:03,522 --> 00:59:06,689
crude limits of the human body.

591
00:59:06,689 --> 00:59:11,256
But even your full mechanical
works have been destroyed.

592
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,256
The Afro Droid‐‐

593
00:59:13,256 --> 00:59:16,389
Ha! Scrap metal at the bottom

594
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:20,556
of the ruined temple
of the Empty Seven.

595
00:59:20,556 --> 00:59:22,456
But now...

596
00:59:22,456 --> 00:59:27,222
(OS) Muscle, bone,
blood, bile, merged

597
00:59:27,222 --> 00:59:31,389
with nano‐technology, chemically
programmed neuro‐receptors,

598
00:59:31,389 --> 00:59:34,322
and things so forbidden

599
00:59:34,322 --> 00:59:38,022
it's more Alchemy,
than bio‐technology.

600
00:59:41,522 --> 00:59:45,122
You truly are the
world's most wicked,

601
00:59:45,122 --> 00:59:48,489
shit‐faced genius scientist.

602
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:53,289
You'll burn in hell for your
insults against nature.

603
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:57,422
You praise me so
wonderfully Lady Sio.

604
00:59:57,422 --> 01:00:00,556
I am not worthy
of your poetry...

605
01:00:00,556 --> 01:00:06,389
You scum. History will mourn the
atrocities you now commit.

606
01:00:06,389 --> 01:00:09,489
You should be burned alive.

607
01:00:11,556 --> 01:00:13,589
Ahhhh...!

608
01:00:24,089 --> 01:00:27,389
Afro will chase me‐‐
and my brother‐‐

609
01:00:27,389 --> 01:00:29,322
to the ruined city.

610
01:00:29,322 --> 01:00:35,289
When he arrives, he will see
the consequences of his sins.

611
01:00:35,289 --> 01:00:39,156
His twice‐killed only friend...

612
01:00:39,156 --> 01:00:41,322
...and his beloved
father shall impale

613
01:00:41,322 --> 01:00:45,422
him with their vengeful blades.

614
01:00:46,656 --> 01:00:49,222
And then‐‐at the last moment,

615
01:00:49,222 --> 01:00:51,356
these hands will be the ones

616
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:56,089
that end the life of
Afro Samurai.

617
01:00:56,089 --> 01:01:04,389
He's not even worthy to die
by your erotic and wicked hands!

618
01:01:09,356 --> 01:01:15,222
But his end will not bring
him bliss, my professor.

619
01:01:25,622 --> 01:01:30,522
Damn it's hot up in this piece!

620
01:01:30,522 --> 01:01:32,656
Ain't there a quicker
way to Cherry Hill?

621
01:01:32,656 --> 01:01:34,289
And by the way, you <i>know</i>

622
01:01:34,289 --> 01:01:37,389
that bitch Sio is walkin'
us into a trap don't ya?

623
01:01:37,389 --> 01:01:41,056
That was one weird
family reunion too‐‐

624
01:01:41,056 --> 01:01:44,089
eh Afro? I'm sure
lots of folks would

625
01:01:44,089 --> 01:01:46,089
love to see their dead
daddies alive again.

626
01:01:46,089 --> 01:01:49,722
But, I'm not so sure seeing a
living head with nasty ass guts

627
01:01:49,722 --> 01:01:52,522
and shit is what most
folks had in mind!

628
01:01:52,522 --> 01:01:54,456
I mean, how could
he be alive, huh?

629
01:01:54,456 --> 01:01:56,189
Maybe it wasn't him!

630
01:01:56,189 --> 01:01:57,222
(sudden enthusiasm)
It's a trick!

631
01:01:57,222 --> 01:02:00,089
Maybe it was another
robot like that Afro Droid

632
01:02:00,089 --> 01:02:01,689
you killed a while back.

633
01:02:01,689 --> 01:02:03,389
Or, maybe it was like a muppet!

634
01:02:03,389 --> 01:02:06,656
You know, like controlled by
her hand or something (pause).

635
01:02:08,322 --> 01:02:12,122
OK that was stupid.
It ain't no muppet.

636
01:02:12,122 --> 01:02:13,489
But whatever it was‐‐

637
01:02:13,489 --> 01:02:16,589
one thing is for sure.

638
01:02:16,589 --> 01:02:20,289
That bitch is... crazy!

639
01:02:20,289 --> 01:02:23,456
She must really hate you to
do all of this unnatural shit.

640
01:02:23,456 --> 01:02:25,189
And what's up with KUMA?

641
01:02:25,189 --> 01:02:27,522
Ain't he normally the cryin'
and complainin' type?

642
01:02:27,522 --> 01:02:29,689
Dude didn't say a damn word!

643
01:02:29,689 --> 01:02:32,122
Now <i>that</i> creeps me out.

644
01:02:32,122 --> 01:02:34,556
Sumpin' is wrong
and I don't like it!

645
01:02:34,556 --> 01:02:36,489
Oh... And... Uh...

646
01:02:36,489 --> 01:02:39,656
Whaddya wanna do
'bout that kid followin' us?

647
01:02:40,622 --> 01:02:41,656
So... What like
you like killed his

648
01:02:41,656 --> 01:02:45,322
paps and now he's
probably trying to axe you.

649
01:02:45,322 --> 01:02:48,556
That sounds familiar
don't it? Heee hee!

650
01:02:49,989 --> 01:02:52,189
Well don't sweat iut.

651
01:02:52,189 --> 01:02:53,756
Kid ain't gonna
last much longer.

652
01:02:53,756 --> 01:02:55,256
Little bit's been
draggin' behind

653
01:02:55,256 --> 01:02:58,689
us in this damn heat for days.

654
01:02:58,689 --> 01:03:01,089
(with a deadly serious voice)
He'll be dead by morning.

655
01:03:26,022 --> 01:03:28,656
I'm sorry Daddy...

656
01:04:37,781 --> 01:04:41,729
I wish you three could have
seen the look on his face when

657
01:04:41,729 --> 01:04:46,096
I showed him the living head
of his own dead father.

658
01:04:46,096 --> 01:04:49,596
Never forget that
it was Afro Samurai

659
01:04:49,596 --> 01:04:52,096
that made you what you are.

660
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:55,996
He will live in Hell on Earth
for what he has done to us.

661
01:04:55,996 --> 01:04:59,296
You will enjoy every second of

662
01:04:59,296 --> 01:05:03,662
excrutiating agony
that I inflict upon him.

663
01:05:03,662 --> 01:05:07,162
You will watch as he bleeds
from his very pores,

664
01:05:07,162 --> 01:05:12,596
listen to the sound
of his breaking bones,

665
01:05:12,596 --> 01:05:17,796
smell his fear
and his burning flesh.

666
01:05:37,962 --> 01:05:40,996
His death will be so filled

667
01:05:40,996 --> 01:05:45,629
with horror,
it will pass into legend.

668
01:05:45,629 --> 01:05:47,129
And I will too‐‐

669
01:05:47,129 --> 01:05:50,929
as his legendary executioner!

670
01:06:45,296 --> 01:06:46,829
Mountain Climbing?

671
01:06:46,829 --> 01:06:49,962
How'd I get talked
into this, man?

672
01:06:49,962 --> 01:06:54,062
We got no equipment!
I need a sports drink!

673
01:06:54,062 --> 01:06:56,029
You got a rope?

674
01:06:56,029 --> 01:06:58,662
You sure we goin' the right way?

675
01:07:02,596 --> 01:07:04,696
The air's getting' thin Afro!

676
01:07:04,696 --> 01:07:06,296
I think I'm gonna die, man!

677
01:07:06,296 --> 01:07:08,129
Or at least have a stroke.

678
01:07:08,129 --> 01:07:11,262
You stressin' me out!
I hate heights!

679
01:07:28,929 --> 01:07:30,996
(Whistles in amazement
then speaks)

680
01:07:30,996 --> 01:07:34,829
Is this the meeting spot? Damn!

681
01:07:34,829 --> 01:07:38,862
I bet back in the day
this place was SWEET!

682
01:07:38,862 --> 01:07:41,262
It's like a messed‐up
theme park!

683
01:07:41,262 --> 01:07:44,629
Bet they had Candy Corn,
Funnel Cakes...

684
01:07:44,629 --> 01:07:47,829
...some mean ass
coasters, the works!

685
01:07:47,829 --> 01:07:50,062
Ain't nobody home now, though..

686
01:07:50,062 --> 01:07:52,196
(Reverently)
But what happened to it man?

687
01:07:52,196 --> 01:07:56,896
Shame it all's in ruins.
Who did this?

688
01:07:56,896 --> 01:08:00,029
Hey, Afro, are you sure this is

689
01:08:00,029 --> 01:08:03,729
the place that the chick said
she'd be waiting for you?

690
01:08:03,729 --> 01:08:06,962
(briefly seeing JUSTICE)
Check it out, that's JUSTICE!

691
01:08:06,962 --> 01:08:07,762
(changing subjects quickly)
You know you never did

692
01:08:07,762 --> 01:08:10,162
ask for directions
along the way.

693
01:08:10,162 --> 01:08:12,796
Yo Afro!

694
01:08:51,529 --> 01:08:54,529
(Skeptical, but not afraid)
Umm. Now whose these is?

695
01:08:54,529 --> 01:08:58,096
Costume party?
Welcome committee?

696
01:08:58,096 --> 01:09:00,162
Comedy troupe?

697
01:09:00,162 --> 01:09:02,062
(to the masked trio)
Yeah thanks. But umm...
no thanks...

698
01:09:02,062 --> 01:09:05,196
...we gotta go to a meeting, OK?

699
01:09:07,296 --> 01:09:12,162
(steps forward a little)
Okay! Let's see. Yo Funny Face!

700
01:09:12,162 --> 01:09:15,662
You seen a crazy
sexy bitch with

701
01:09:15,662 --> 01:09:18,496
a teddy bear headed
dude around here?

702
01:09:19,862 --> 01:09:21,896
That ain't no blunt!

703
01:09:22,862 --> 01:09:25,862
Aw...! What the...?

704
01:09:25,862 --> 01:09:29,196
Ohhhhhh Afro!

705
01:09:29,196 --> 01:09:31,496
Am I gonna die again?

706
01:09:36,562 --> 01:09:39,829
Lady Sio is... not here.

707
01:09:42,829 --> 01:09:45,196
You don't remember us, do you?

708
01:09:45,196 --> 01:09:48,296
Afro Samurai...

709
01:09:48,296 --> 01:09:51,996
Who would have imagined
that the boy we once knew...

710
01:09:51,996 --> 01:09:55,829
...would return as
such a mad executioner...

711
01:09:55,829 --> 01:09:58,762
Driven only by
his murderous rage...

712
01:09:58,762 --> 01:10:02,662
...to bring death
and chaos to the world...

713
01:10:05,262 --> 01:10:07,796
Draw your sword, Afro Samurai.

714
01:11:10,529 --> 01:11:12,229
Now you die!

715
01:11:29,962 --> 01:11:31,129
Professor...

716
01:11:31,129 --> 01:11:35,729
What ails you, my lady?
Please rejoice.

717
01:11:35,729 --> 01:11:40,629
The restoration of Afro'S father
has entered the final stage.

718
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:43,896
However, this stage
is very sensitive.

719
01:11:43,896 --> 01:11:49,596
If the slightest error occurs,
we still could lose everything.

720
01:11:51,129 --> 01:11:52,929
They are gone.

721
01:11:52,929 --> 01:11:54,662
What's this?

722
01:11:55,829 --> 01:11:58,762
They would never undertake
anything without my orders.

723
01:11:58,762 --> 01:11:59,996
What have you done?

724
01:11:59,996 --> 01:12:03,862
Perhaps they went into town?

725
01:12:04,962 --> 01:12:06,196
What do you mean?

726
01:12:06,196 --> 01:12:08,729
Or perhaps...

727
01:12:08,729 --> 01:12:12,562
They challenged Afro
SAMURAI without you...

728
01:12:12,562 --> 01:12:18,862
But don't fear. Who knows‐‐
they might just win.

729
01:12:18,862 --> 01:12:21,596
After all, you might
be surprised to

730
01:12:21,596 --> 01:12:23,696
hear that they all have quite an

731
01:12:23,696 --> 01:12:26,929
impressive array of
gadgets engineered

732
01:12:26,929 --> 01:12:33,796
on their bodies not to mention
a special drug injection or two.

733
01:12:39,796 --> 01:12:45,129
L...Lady Sio?
What sport is this?

734
01:12:53,696 --> 01:12:55,662
My, my, my.

735
01:12:55,662 --> 01:12:59,862
What a hasty princess
we have here.

736
01:12:59,862 --> 01:13:02,629
The regeneration is not yet...

737
01:13:04,562 --> 01:13:09,529
Heh heh heh. You've done such a
splendid job, dear Professor.

738
01:13:09,529 --> 01:13:11,662
You've equipped
all of the players

739
01:13:11,662 --> 01:13:14,096
with all the right
modifications.

740
01:13:14,096 --> 01:13:16,829
I owe you my thanks.

741
01:13:17,896 --> 01:13:23,929
Now it's time for you to
take a well‐deserved break.

742
01:13:23,929 --> 01:13:26,929
Good night Professor!

743
01:13:41,762 --> 01:13:46,129
The other "executioner"
is about to awaken...

744
01:15:06,662 --> 01:15:09,062
No matter your intentions...

745
01:15:09,062 --> 01:15:12,629
There are things that we
cannot allow you to do...

746
01:15:12,629 --> 01:15:17,129
We must not allow our Lady Sio
to tread the path of darkness...

747
01:15:17,129 --> 01:15:20,796
Such a sweet lady she is...

748
01:15:20,796 --> 01:15:24,262
...we will not allow her
to fall from grace.

749
01:15:24,262 --> 01:15:29,562
(holds up his dagger)
Instead, we will be the sinners.

750
01:16:02,962 --> 01:16:07,162
All I wanted was for Afro to
see the town he destroyed.

751
01:16:07,162 --> 01:16:08,229
I wanted him to see the

752
01:16:08,229 --> 01:16:12,129
consequences of his sin
before I slit his throat.

753
01:16:12,129 --> 01:16:14,862
But now my vassals
are most likely dead.

754
01:16:16,962 --> 01:16:21,062
Fools rush in where
angels fear to tread.

755
01:17:05,529 --> 01:17:08,629
MICHAEL! SHOOT HIM NOW!

756
01:17:11,229 --> 01:17:15,162
What are you waiting for? Do it!

757
01:17:15,162 --> 01:17:17,029
(OS) Shoot them...

758
01:17:17,029 --> 01:17:19,729
She's dead already...

759
01:17:19,729 --> 01:17:23,262
Do it... for our Lady Sio...

760
01:17:48,962 --> 01:17:50,896
Tomoe!

761
01:18:29,896 --> 01:18:32,162
Afro Samurai...

762
01:18:34,029 --> 01:18:40,929
I knew that sooner or later
this day would come.

763
01:18:43,129 --> 01:18:46,596
I will die with you.

764
01:19:42,453 --> 01:19:44,353
What the hell?

765
01:19:44,353 --> 01:19:51,553
(long yell)
Yo Afro! Afro!!!!

766
01:20:00,586 --> 01:20:02,486
Afro! You made it!

767
01:20:02,486 --> 01:20:04,186
How'd you survive home boy?

768
01:20:04,186 --> 01:20:05,453
Tell me what I missed! Ya know,

769
01:20:05,453 --> 01:20:07,519
I got hit by a sleeping
dart. Hurt too!

770
01:20:07,519 --> 01:20:09,986
But I'm a tough, so don't worry.

771
01:20:09,986 --> 01:20:12,386
So did you whack some
crazy moth a fuckas?

772
01:20:21,653 --> 01:20:23,219
What the...?!

773
01:20:35,286 --> 01:20:37,486
Follow me, son.

774
01:20:37,486 --> 01:20:40,953
HOLY FUCK!

775
01:20:42,019 --> 01:20:46,253
Now I HAVE
officially seen it all!

776
01:21:01,553 --> 01:21:04,619
Sio... Jinno...

777
01:21:04,619 --> 01:21:08,953
Hey Afro. why you got to
walk directly into every trap?

778
01:21:08,953 --> 01:21:11,153
You stupid or what?

779
01:21:11,153 --> 01:21:13,253
Up there is the
crazy bitch who been

780
01:21:13,253 --> 01:21:14,886
pullin' the strings
this whole time

781
01:21:14,886 --> 01:21:17,019
AND your old revived robo‐pal‐‐

782
01:21:17,019 --> 01:21:19,286
who don't like your ass neither!

783
01:21:19,286 --> 01:21:21,486
On top of that,
we followin' some

784
01:21:21,486 --> 01:21:24,319
freak o nature that
you think is your dad!

785
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:27,453
That is my real father.

786
01:21:29,919 --> 01:21:32,919
(exasperated)
Ergh! Wrong answer. That's it.

787
01:21:32,919 --> 01:21:39,153
You're an idiot. And this is as
far as I can go. See ya!

788
01:21:45,619 --> 01:21:48,319
I'm so happy you've made it.

789
01:21:48,319 --> 01:21:51,119
We've have so much to...
talk about!

790
01:21:55,586 --> 01:22:00,386
I have come for my father
and the #1 headband.

791
01:22:00,386 --> 01:22:02,486
(Dry Sarcasm)
What a surprise...

792
01:22:02,486 --> 01:22:04,319
But what can you possibly do

793
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:09,119
with your body
so utterly destroyed?

794
01:22:24,253 --> 01:22:26,453
We're going to torture you.

795
01:22:26,453 --> 01:22:28,619
Death will come slowly.

796
01:22:45,153 --> 01:22:49,586
(groan)
Why didn't you wear
the No. 1 headband?

797
01:22:49,586 --> 01:22:54,019
I just wanted revenge...
for you.

798
01:22:54,019 --> 01:22:57,453
Whatever your reason,
one must shoulder the burden of

799
01:22:57,453 --> 01:23:01,119
destiny the instant he
puts on the headband.

800
01:23:01,119 --> 01:23:03,453
You should know that by now.

801
01:23:03,453 --> 01:23:06,219
Become the No. 1.

802
01:23:06,219 --> 01:23:10,853
You can never escape
the cycle of blood.

803
01:23:14,286 --> 01:23:17,553
The No. 1 kills or is killed.

804
01:23:17,553 --> 01:23:22,019
You don't have the luxury to
choose whose blood you spill.

805
01:23:22,019 --> 01:23:25,086
Take back your headband.

806
01:23:25,086 --> 01:23:29,319
Fear not... my son...

807
01:23:29,319 --> 01:23:32,953
Urgh... father... wait...

808
01:23:32,953 --> 01:23:34,486
Father...

809
01:24:31,886 --> 01:24:36,286
Look... Look my dear brother.

810
01:24:37,453 --> 01:24:40,219
Afro Samurai is
about to meet his end...

811
01:24:40,219 --> 01:24:42,019
Just as I planned‐‐

812
01:24:42,019 --> 01:24:45,219
at the hands of his own father!

813
01:24:48,019 --> 01:24:50,586
He will finally pay for
the pain he's caused us‐‐

814
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:55,638
for the pain he's caused
thousands... like us!

815
01:25:41,586 --> 01:25:44,853
Jinno! Jinno!

816
01:26:07,253 --> 01:26:09,953
(excited) Kill him! Kill him!

817
01:26:09,953 --> 01:26:14,286
Once and for all! (laughter)

818
01:26:53,286 --> 01:26:55,486
(Struggling) Ahh....

819
01:26:55,486 --> 01:26:57,519
...Afro....

820
01:27:01,219 --> 01:27:04,586
(groan)

821
01:27:04,586 --> 01:27:07,219
Kill him Afro! Waste him!

822
01:27:07,219 --> 01:27:08,619
That ain't your real father!

823
01:27:08,619 --> 01:27:12,353
That's it! Finish it! Do it!

824
01:27:12,353 --> 01:27:15,919
I cannot kill my father...

825
01:27:15,919 --> 01:27:19,886
Wha... then this
is the end of Afro!

826
01:27:40,353 --> 01:27:43,053
Did you see that, Jinno?

827
01:27:43,053 --> 01:27:46,886
We did it! We finally
brought him to justice!

828
01:27:46,886 --> 01:27:51,919
And it was we...
we who killed him!!

829
01:27:51,919 --> 01:27:55,153
Look, look my dear brother!

830
01:27:57,486 --> 01:28:00,886
(realizes the change in Jinno)
Jinno? Jinno?

831
01:28:02,386 --> 01:28:04,119
(in whisper) Afro...

832
01:28:08,486 --> 01:28:11,519
Af...ro...

833
01:28:15,219 --> 01:28:19,353
Afro!!!!

834
01:28:29,119 --> 01:28:33,119
What have you done...

835
01:28:33,119 --> 01:28:36,953
What have you done to Afro?!!

836
01:28:40,086 --> 01:28:41,453
Why...?

837
01:28:42,319 --> 01:28:45,319
Jinno! Why are you
protecting Afro?!

838
01:28:45,319 --> 01:28:49,253
He's dead now! It's no use!

839
01:28:52,953 --> 01:28:58,219
Have you forgotten what
Afro did to us? To you!?!

840
01:29:19,186 --> 01:29:20,919
Jinno!

841
01:29:31,286 --> 01:29:32,453
(groan)
Afro...

842
01:29:34,253 --> 01:29:39,419
(V.O. during Sio flashback).
My... dearest... brother...

843
01:29:43,086 --> 01:29:44,453
I must...

844
01:29:45,553 --> 01:29:49,019
...protect Swordmaster's dojo...

845
01:29:50,353 --> 01:29:53,953
...must protect everyone...

846
01:29:55,886 --> 01:30:00,186
...including my brother... Afro.

847
01:31:06,219 --> 01:31:11,853
I love you my Jinno...

848
01:31:15,419 --> 01:31:17,853
My brother...

849
01:31:32,953 --> 01:31:37,319
It's been a long time,
hasn't it, Sio?

850
01:31:43,153 --> 01:31:46,553
How have you been, princess?

851
01:31:50,253 --> 01:31:52,219
Jin...no...

852
01:31:55,953 --> 01:31:57,486
(groan)

853
01:33:12,561 --> 01:33:14,928
Run, Afro! You can't win.

854
01:33:14,928 --> 01:33:18,962
I said <i>run</i>, damn it!
You can't win this one.

855
01:33:18,962 --> 01:33:22,228
He's too strong! He ain't human!

856
01:33:22,228 --> 01:33:25,628
Don't! Don't!

857
01:33:25,628 --> 01:33:28,228
Shut...

858
01:33:28,228 --> 01:33:29,595
...up.

859
01:33:30,028 --> 01:33:31,928
It'll soon be over.

860
01:33:33,095 --> 01:33:36,995
Forgive me.
But, you are not my father.

861
01:33:38,128 --> 01:33:42,462
My father died a long time ago.

862
01:33:47,095 --> 01:33:48,628
Fear not...

863
01:34:34,295 --> 01:34:35,862
Father!

864
01:34:58,328 --> 01:35:00,362
(frightened sob)

865
01:35:18,362 --> 01:35:21,495
Anytime you're ready.

866
01:35:38,362 --> 01:35:40,328
Will it ever end?

867
01:35:44,428 --> 01:35:47,895
(sigh) Guess not.

868
01:35:47,895 --> 01:35:48,795
Huh. From the look of your face,

869
01:35:48,795 --> 01:35:52,262
I'd say you had a
hell of a rough day.

870
01:35:52,262 --> 01:35:54,062
You knew this
already didn't you?

871
01:35:54,062 --> 01:35:58,328
You knew it don't
ever end once it starts.

872
01:35:58,328 --> 01:36:00,995
I <i>knew</i>, Afro Samurai.

873
01:36:00,995 --> 01:36:04,628
But, I won't say anything.
Not anymore.

874
01:36:04,628 --> 01:36:08,362
But, y'know.
Not turning your back...

875
01:36:10,128 --> 01:36:12,862
...that's the only
choice you've <i>ever</i> had.

876
01:40:56,662 --> 01:41:01,362
Been waiting a
long time for you.
