1
00:00:58,795 --> 00:01:01,759
Welcome! It's been a while, hasn't it?

2
00:01:01,817 --> 00:01:02,638
What do you say...

3
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:03,569
A toast...

4
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:07,145
to my latest venture, CafÃ© Zero Two!

5
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:08,162
Salue!

6
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,648
Salue!

7
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:14,524
Who would've thought Tamaki had such a flair for business?

8
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:18,517
It's not that impressive given the name he settled on.

9
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:20,415
That's the truth.

10
00:01:21,638 --> 00:01:23,943
Now, now. What's all the fuss about, sweetheart?

11
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,944
Everything okay?

12
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:26,881
There's a changing station upstairs, if you need.

13
00:01:26,906 --> 00:01:28,322
Thanks. We're fine.

14
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:31,330
Someone's just a little cranky, is all. Yeah.

15
00:01:31,355 --> 00:01:33,063
Ah. I see.

16
00:01:33,088 --> 00:01:33,814
Ohgi!

17
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,335
Yes?

18
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,402
Tell me, why you aren't you still Prime Minister?

19
00:01:37,442 --> 00:01:38,984
That natural apathy catch up with you?

20
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:40,793
I wouldn't call him apathetic.

21
00:01:40,818 --> 00:01:42,907
He just wasn't cut out for it, y'know?

22
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:44,832
Bein' one of the brass takes brass!

23
00:01:44,857 --> 00:01:46,871
Not his area of expertise.

24
00:01:47,466 --> 00:01:49,524
It's so strange seeing them like this.

25
00:01:49,604 --> 00:01:51,479
Ah, the spoils of peace.

26
00:01:51,504 --> 00:01:54,005
Refreshing having all of us together like this, no?

27
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,789
Never thought I'd live to see the day.

28
00:02:06,986 --> 00:02:08,887
Year two of the Kowa Era.

29
00:02:08,931 --> 00:02:13,344
Approximately one year since the death
of Emperor Lelouch at the hands of Zero.

30
00:02:14,228 --> 00:02:17,186
Owing to the newly reorganized Federation of Nations,

31
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:20,438
the world celebrates an unprecedented time of peace.

32
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:24,581
A time history will remember as the Miraculous Tomorrow

33
00:02:24,784 --> 00:02:28,587
when the threat of war and terrorist
insurgency all but disappeared.

34
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,992
And yet, simmering beneath the surface,

35
00:02:33,024 --> 00:02:36,103
conflict continues to lurk in the hearts of mankind.

36
00:02:36,328 --> 00:02:39,651
The Miraculous Tomorrow will inevitably pass.

37
00:02:40,664 --> 00:02:41,749
Very well, then.

38
00:02:42,097 --> 00:02:44,749
I'll consult with the legislator to ascertain

39
00:02:44,774 --> 00:02:48,487
if the refugees can be taken in
by the Principality of Britannia.

40
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:53,384
That said, I ask you to bear in mind,
at present my authority is limited.

41
00:02:53,575 --> 00:02:54,419
Hm?

42
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:56,821
...I'll try to accommodate them as...

43
00:02:57,946 --> 00:02:58,613
It's me.

44
00:02:58,674 --> 00:03:00,646
Knightmare Frames approaching from the west.

45
00:03:00,692 --> 00:03:01,713
Who are they attached to?

46
00:03:06,983 --> 00:03:07,744
Terrorists!

47
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,653
Get the honorary consultant inside! Now!

48
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:19,038
Heh.

49
00:03:20,427 --> 00:03:21,569
Wait! It's not armed!

50
00:03:21,594 --> 00:03:23,415
This unit's strictly ceremonial!

51
00:03:23,528 --> 00:03:25,201
The float system's disconnected!

52
00:03:25,226 --> 00:03:27,597
It's the only one available. I'll make do!

53
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:30,439
What's going on?

54
00:03:30,464 --> 00:03:31,865
This is a demilitarized zone!

55
00:03:33,144 --> 00:03:34,096
Take cover!

56
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:37,228
Just like that, a full year of peace broken.

57
00:03:38,105 --> 00:03:40,499
Lelouch, your legacy is tarnished.

58
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,827
Hm?

59
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,595
Low visibility, but I can still take 'em!

60
00:04:02,705 --> 00:04:06,531
He's gifted. Just as my sister's prophecies foretold.

61
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:12,775
Zero! There's another unit coming in hot!

62
00:04:12,831 --> 00:04:14,330
No info on their weaponry.

63
00:04:14,356 --> 00:04:16,570
Yeah? Let's see what I can do about that.

64
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,996
Ugh. I could really use a sand board.

65
00:04:19,147 --> 00:04:19,695
Uh?

66
00:04:23,327 --> 00:04:25,214
Exactly as she described!

67
00:04:27,832 --> 00:04:30,729
Where'd this come from all of a sudden? The hell!

68
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:32,697
I don't have enough thrust to break free!

69
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:39,966
Urgent breaking news.

70
00:04:40,022 --> 00:04:44,413
An honorary WHA Consultant has been
abducted during a refugee camp inspection.

71
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:48,948
Nunnally vi Brittania was taken by parties unknown,
along with the chief advisor of the Black Knights.

72
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:52,191
Wow. It's been over a year, hasn't it?

73
00:04:52,277 --> 00:04:54,218
Since Jeremiah took us in, I mean.

74
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:57,307
I... I really owe you one, Shirley.

75
00:04:57,402 --> 00:05:00,453
Don't... Don't think I'm not aware of the risks you took.

76
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:01,830
It's just...

77
00:05:04,634 --> 00:05:05,753
Y... Yeah, well...

78
00:05:05,868 --> 00:05:07,732
Anya knows what she's talking about.

79
00:05:10,138 --> 00:05:10,912
Right.

80
00:05:10,945 --> 00:05:13,465
There's a gateway left Charles didn't touch.

81
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,056
Think I'll go and see for myself.

82
00:07:17,966 --> 00:07:20,547
This is Milly Ashford reporting from Zilkhstan,

83
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:23,696
a kingdom universally renowned as a nation of warriors.

84
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,163
Impregnable as a fortress, Zilkhstan has
fended off countless invasions for centuries.

85
00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:33,978
Its soldiers are held in high regard by military experts,

86
00:07:34,094 --> 00:07:36,428
hired as mercenaries the world over.

87
00:07:36,532 --> 00:07:40,550
Comprised of 90% desert with
precious few resources to go around,

88
00:07:40,575 --> 00:07:45,635
Zilkhstan's chief export is entirely represented
by their fighting force and military technology.

89
00:07:51,678 --> 00:07:55,551
It appears the Royal Guard has just
returned from a reconnaissance mission.

90
00:07:55,847 --> 00:07:57,279
I'll see if I can have a word.

91
00:07:57,304 --> 00:07:58,790
Is this a good idea?

92
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:01,331
The situation calls for a public statement.

93
00:08:01,436 --> 00:08:03,444
I'm sure you're doing your best to unravel

94
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:06,237
the so-called "Puzzlement" at the Hashvess refugee camp.

95
00:08:06,262 --> 00:08:08,721
Care to comment on the missing WHA workers,

96
00:08:08,746 --> 00:08:11,208
in particular Honorary Consultant Nunnally?

97
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:13,997
I regret to say no new information has come to light.

98
00:08:14,492 --> 00:08:17,352
The area is rife with border disputes, I'm afraid.

99
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:19,935
There are five countries are involved, including us.

100
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,691
Progress may be slow, but our efforts will continue.

101
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:26,357
We feel Miss Nunnally's loss acutely.

102
00:08:26,382 --> 00:08:29,740
Her contributions to the humanitarian
effort cannot be overstated.

103
00:08:29,937 --> 00:08:33,746
As we look to the future, we must think on the
lasting peace she worked so hard to bring about.

104
00:08:33,811 --> 00:08:36,298
Also, I should add that our country's Divine

105
00:08:36,406 --> 00:08:39,176
...is greatly troubled by this turn of events.

106
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:41,383
Okay. It's just about ready.

107
00:08:41,648 --> 00:08:43,743
Lelouch, spread out the sofreh, would you?

108
00:08:47,157 --> 00:08:48,928
Like last time, remember?

109
00:08:59,643 --> 00:09:00,577
Oh!

110
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:02,814
Never mind.

111
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,286
Hope you're hungry.

112
00:09:05,915 --> 00:09:07,673
Help yourself to as much as you like.

113
00:09:10,285 --> 00:09:10,751
Hm?

114
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,791
Calm down! It's all right!

115
00:09:21,987 --> 00:09:23,641
There's nothing to be afra...

116
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:38,796
That's it. Breathe.

117
00:09:39,114 --> 00:09:41,085
Everything's going to be just fine.

118
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,763
Nothing here can hurt you, I promise, okay?

119
00:09:44,764 --> 00:09:47,412
Hey, why don't I make you some warm milk?

120
00:09:47,497 --> 00:09:49,290
I'll put lots of honey in it.

121
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,810
Well, if it's not here either, I suppose...

122
00:11:06,885 --> 00:11:08,577
They haven't homed in on Lelouch,

123
00:11:08,747 --> 00:11:10,241
but better safe than sorry.

124
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:17,632
Subject knows we're here and is preparing to retaliate.

125
00:11:33,597 --> 00:11:36,102
Come on, come on, please don't drag us into this mess.

126
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:45,308
Wait a second! You can't be who I think you are!

127
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,412
Hey, Kallen.

128
00:11:46,784 --> 00:11:49,273
Rough as ever I see and in more ways than one!

129
00:11:49,384 --> 00:11:52,455
Pizza girl. What're you doing in place like this?

130
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,065
I could ask you the same question.

131
00:11:54,397 --> 00:11:57,105
I wasn't exactly expecting us to run into each other.

132
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,028
It's been far too long, Miss C.C.

133
00:11:59,213 --> 00:12:00,744
Fancy meeting you here.

134
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:03,163
If you're wondering what we're up to in this wasteland,

135
00:12:03,188 --> 00:12:05,949
Prince Schneizel asked us to find Nunnally and Zero.

136
00:12:05,974 --> 00:12:08,848
Zilkhstan seemed the obvious place to start.

137
00:12:09,236 --> 00:12:11,361
He couldn't come out and say it publicly.

138
00:12:11,386 --> 00:12:14,393
There'd be a diplomatic outcry
over lack of evidence, so...

139
00:12:14,991 --> 00:12:15,819
Here we are.

140
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:18,996
Right. If you hadn't noticed,
they're trying to eliminate us,

141
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:20,529
which strengthens our case.

142
00:12:20,842 --> 00:12:23,802
Have you seen the news? Very interesting, I'd have to say.

143
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:25,739
Um, actually, I'm just...

144
00:12:29,365 --> 00:12:30,739
If you're a tourist...

145
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:33,652
...I sincerely apologize.

146
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:35,191
Let's move!

147
00:12:52,955 --> 00:12:54,576
All of you stand down.

148
00:12:55,895 --> 00:12:57,524
Are you the one in charge?

149
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:00,748
This attraction's a bit much for a
couple tourists, wouldn't you agree?

150
00:13:00,773 --> 00:13:04,933
Maybe so, but it's perfect for a bunch
of mangy dogs here on Federation business.

151
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,499
Tch. Yeah? Well, how 'bout we settle this one on one?

152
00:13:08,524 --> 00:13:09,657
I don't think so.

153
00:13:09,682 --> 00:13:12,165
You're not exactly dealing with a samurai.

154
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,146
What the...? What just happened?

155
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,158
I've got your back. What's the score?

156
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,514
How'd you do that?

157
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:32,360
No, you don't!

158
00:13:32,385 --> 00:13:34,393
Stop! What on earth has gotten into you?

159
00:13:34,418 --> 00:13:38,029
Now we just sit back, relax, and
watch the fools destroy each other.

160
00:13:42,397 --> 00:13:43,172
Wait!

161
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,397
How many freakin' brothers do you have?

162
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:52,815
Get off of me, you bastard!

163
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,552
Looks like a Geass!

164
00:13:54,577 --> 00:13:56,714
Wow. You've heard of Geass?

165
00:13:57,356 --> 00:13:59,501
Seems I'll have to delve into your background.

166
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:03,939
You...

167
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:05,479
But you were...

168
00:14:05,858 --> 00:14:08,153
I believe the word is dead.

169
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:11,301
Wait, what?

170
00:14:11,326 --> 00:14:12,852
Is that your Geass?

171
00:14:12,896 --> 00:14:15,361
You can warp a person's perception at will?

172
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:17,319
Not the most impressive power.

173
00:14:17,626 --> 00:14:20,117
Believe me. It's got its uses.

174
00:14:28,263 --> 00:14:30,853
Hey, come over here and give me a hand.

175
00:14:30,977 --> 00:14:33,060
Looks like we're dealing with someone special.

176
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:34,253
As you wish.

177
00:14:34,336 --> 00:14:36,616
What? My Geass didn't work?

178
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,211
Impossible!

179
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:40,192
Afraid you picked the wrong fight.

180
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,477
So it would seem.

181
00:14:41,545 --> 00:14:44,570
How rude of me to treat a former master so disgracefully.

182
00:14:44,648 --> 00:14:46,307
I'll show more respect next time.

183
00:14:48,849 --> 00:14:50,428
They're from a splinter faction.

184
00:14:52,297 --> 00:14:53,067
Hm?

185
00:14:56,577 --> 00:14:57,952
Think he was one of yours?

186
00:14:57,977 --> 00:14:59,928
I haven't been part of the Order in a while now.

187
00:15:00,118 --> 00:15:02,700
V.V.'s gone, so it's not clear who has the authority.

188
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:04,057
We can talk about it later.

189
00:15:04,267 --> 00:15:05,301
I apologize.

190
00:15:05,326 --> 00:15:07,322
It wasn't my intention to bring you into this.

191
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,073
For the time being...

192
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:09,431
Look, I'm ready to go.

193
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:10,499
Thing is...

194
00:15:10,766 --> 00:15:11,820
What's the problem?

195
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:13,151
I'm not traveling alone.

196
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,032
I hate to say this, but they'll have to come with us, too.

197
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:18,997
Well, if you insist, so be it.

198
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,990
I wouldn't want the police finding him.

199
00:15:31,492 --> 00:15:33,636
You, on your feet. We're moving out.

200
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:41,649
Not to be that guy, but we need to disappear.

201
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:42,903
Master Lelouch?

202
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:56,018
It's all right. Calm down. Please, it's okay.

203
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,629
Is... Is that really?

204
00:15:58,654 --> 00:16:00,479
It's rather complicated.

205
00:16:00,856 --> 00:16:02,648
It is, and it isn't.

206
00:16:02,986 --> 00:16:04,525
Things aren't what they seem.

207
00:16:18,408 --> 00:16:19,188
Hm?

208
00:16:19,931 --> 00:16:21,095
This is the service center.

209
00:16:21,604 --> 00:16:24,145
The issue's source was more or less as we expected.

210
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:27,696
We need to salvage a couple of
parts and could use your help.

211
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:32,213
Also, we've managed to find
ourselves a new customer, so to speak.

212
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:36,155
We'll need the sheet music for
the requiem, if you don't mind.

213
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:39,262
If my instincts are right,

214
00:16:39,525 --> 00:16:42,321
Lelouch may have inherited a Code from Charles.

215
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,291
You mean the one that gives him immortality?

216
00:16:44,316 --> 00:16:45,024
Correct.

217
00:16:45,143 --> 00:16:47,327
He used his Geass in addition to this,

218
00:16:47,352 --> 00:16:48,494
which resulted in...

219
00:16:49,283 --> 00:16:53,472
Well, the code issue was not
resolved, thus the Zero Requiem.

220
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,465
And I'm assuming that's when Shirely got involved.

221
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,182
Yes.

222
00:16:57,275 --> 00:17:00,577
She's a private citizen, so nobody keeps tabs on her.

223
00:17:00,734 --> 00:17:02,106
So Shirley recovered him.

224
00:17:02,131 --> 00:17:05,893
When things died down she brought
his body to a place Jeremiah set up.

225
00:17:06,122 --> 00:17:11,300
And, well, the idea was to reconstruct
Lelouch in C's world, but as you can tell he...

226
00:17:11,325 --> 00:17:12,906
What do you mean reconstruct?

227
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:18,963
The reason I can't die is because any defective body parts
get replaced with ones designed and built in C's world.

228
00:17:19,044 --> 00:17:20,805
So it's like a mirror backup!

229
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,165
Well, not exactly.

230
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:24,818
But I supposed that's one way of looking at it.

231
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:29,827
The problem now, is that Lelouch
affectively destroyed the God of that world.

232
00:17:29,978 --> 00:17:33,687
As a result, it's impossible for me to re-enter on my own.

233
00:17:33,892 --> 00:17:34,690
Hang on,

234
00:17:34,715 --> 00:17:36,946
but you came back to life during the shootout.

235
00:17:37,095 --> 00:17:40,586
Luck. There must still be some parts left over.

236
00:17:40,704 --> 00:17:43,412
However, Lelouch's mind has gone missing.

237
00:17:43,484 --> 00:17:44,913
Then who is this guy?!

238
00:17:45,033 --> 00:17:47,036
The empty vessel of his essence.

239
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:49,847
The pitiful remains of what he once was.

240
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:52,120
Come on!

241
00:17:52,145 --> 00:17:54,293
You think this is what Lelouch wanted?

242
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,943
I'm nothing if not good on my word. I made a promise.

243
00:17:58,071 --> 00:18:00,172
And you'd still keep it even if...

244
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:01,515
Even if...?

245
00:18:01,969 --> 00:18:02,844
I know.

246
00:18:03,261 --> 00:18:05,570
I don't plan on leaving him like this forever.

247
00:18:06,023 --> 00:18:07,937
Why else do you think I came here?

248
00:18:09,428 --> 00:18:12,851
That assassin last night used Geass. You saw it.

249
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:18,299
There's an organization here in Zilkhstan,
distinct from the Geass Order, called Farlaf.

250
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:23,697
They control an access point into
C's world known as the Aramu Gate.

251
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,524
If I can use it, there's a chance.

252
00:18:38,776 --> 00:18:39,552
Forgive me.

253
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,578
The Federation dogs proved more than we bargained for.

254
00:18:42,678 --> 00:18:46,826
I realize a third party intervened,
but this is hardly like you, Qujappat.

255
00:18:46,851 --> 00:18:49,112
How was I supposed to know what she had up her sleeve?

256
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:50,757
You say she was a former master?

257
00:18:50,932 --> 00:18:53,464
Yes. Master V.V.'s predecessor.

258
00:18:53,776 --> 00:18:54,946
C.C., is it?

259
00:18:57,044 --> 00:19:01,400
One wonders whether her appearance is a
revelation or along the lines of an offering.

260
00:19:01,425 --> 00:19:03,592
Federation Spies or users of Geass,

261
00:19:03,617 --> 00:19:05,827
the intruders can have only one of two objectives.

262
00:19:06,131 --> 00:19:08,644
We must bear that in mind while weighing our strategy.

263
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,519
They either mean to gain the Temple of the Princess...

264
00:19:11,544 --> 00:19:14,322
...or the Wailing Prison of Gimsura Plains.

265
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:17,219
Indeed, where the hostages are being held.

266
00:19:17,622 --> 00:19:20,807
Should the United Federation of
Nations obtain evidence in that regard,

267
00:19:21,007 --> 00:19:22,970
our region is subject to air strike.

268
00:19:23,825 --> 00:19:28,573
I see, but within the Wailing
Prison is the ancient the Aramu Gate.

269
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,907
I assume my brother Shalio is there?

270
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,330
He is, as usual.

271
00:19:32,557 --> 00:19:34,891
No doubt still conferring with him.

272
00:19:34,936 --> 00:19:36,645
Have him return to me at once.

273
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,038
Relieve him and be ready to engage
at a moment's notice, Shesthaal.

274
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,498
Namjala latak.

275
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,943
As a proud son of the great and mighty Forgnar,

276
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,382
I'll gladly acquaint the Federation
of Nations with my superior genes.

277
00:20:24,734 --> 00:20:26,619
Can you see the screen, Zero?

278
00:20:26,867 --> 00:20:30,068
Or shall I call you Suzaku Kururugi?

279
00:20:30,653 --> 00:20:33,152
I've made a close study of your fighting prowess.

280
00:20:36,731 --> 00:20:38,549
What was your attitude control?

281
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,722
These moves aren't in the programming.

282
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,762
Come on.

283
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:46,074
How is it your technique changed halfway
through the battle while using the Albion?

284
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:48,407
Tell me, was it the unit's design?

285
00:20:48,432 --> 00:20:49,766
What about you?

286
00:20:49,822 --> 00:20:52,461
How were you able to anticipate my moves?

287
00:20:52,633 --> 00:20:56,767
You knew I'd fall backward. Your trap was counting on it.

288
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:58,555
This again?

289
00:20:58,618 --> 00:21:01,434
I'd prefer you answer my questions first.

290
00:21:02,092 --> 00:21:04,800
We have Nunnally, lest you forget.

291
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,975
You're... You're a monster.

292
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:09,977
Am I? Okay.

293
00:21:10,341 --> 00:21:13,980
If that's what it takes to become
the world's greatest warrior, fine.

294
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,545
I accept that.

295
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:18,486
Protecting those dear to me requires strength.

296
00:21:18,637 --> 00:21:21,924
Quite a lot of it, actually. Unadulterated guile.

297
00:21:22,136 --> 00:21:26,456
Complete and total ruthlessness. All qualities you have.

298
00:21:26,481 --> 00:21:29,886
Yes. Our data on you paints quite a picture.

299
00:21:29,911 --> 00:21:32,470
But it's hardly complete enough to satisfy me.

300
00:21:32,495 --> 00:21:34,678
Now then, what is your method?!

301
00:21:34,703 --> 00:21:37,672
Educate me for Nunnally's sake!

302
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:42,817
Mark my words, your strength will be mine!

303
00:21:43,923 --> 00:21:44,879
Your Majesty.

304
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:48,124
My sister?

305
00:21:48,262 --> 00:21:49,018
Yes.

306
00:21:49,228 --> 00:21:50,229
Very well.

307
00:21:53,822 --> 00:21:56,254
Once the data is collected and backed up,

308
00:21:56,406 --> 00:21:57,584
return to the castle.

309
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:58,940
Namjala latak.

310
00:22:06,183 --> 00:22:06,995
Your Majesty?

311
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,934
I've noticed more of those lately.

312
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:12,585
Yes. The energy packs have been falling short.

313
00:22:12,762 --> 00:22:16,370
General Forgnar has reached out to
India for whatever they can spare,

314
00:22:16,578 --> 00:22:18,684
but everyone's preoccupied with rebuilding.

315
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,010
It all boils down to strength.

316
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:24,371
Our nation will prevail. It must.

317
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:26,685
We have no choice but to succeed.

318
00:22:28,386 --> 00:22:29,296
They gone?

319
00:22:29,321 --> 00:22:32,162
Yes, and If they get suspicious and come back,

320
00:22:32,187 --> 00:22:33,924
we'll have made it to the prison by then.

321
00:22:36,161 --> 00:22:38,620
Thanks for carrying all this stuff, by the way.

322
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:39,706
It's a big help.

323
00:22:39,823 --> 00:22:40,718
Whatever.

324
00:22:40,743 --> 00:22:43,093
Next you're gonna tell me you didn't even have a plan.

325
00:22:43,186 --> 00:22:46,511
Well, I mean, it didn't involve these fancy uniforms,

326
00:22:46,536 --> 00:22:48,040
but I had something in mind.

327
00:22:50,189 --> 00:22:53,496
Please tell me this Aramu Gate isn't just some fairy tale.

328
00:22:53,521 --> 00:22:55,479
It was as temple once upon a time.

329
00:22:55,504 --> 00:22:57,268
Now an infamous prison...

330
00:22:57,328 --> 00:22:59,701
the final home of political enemies.

331
00:22:59,726 --> 00:23:02,687
Dr. Lloyd, if you please, we're about to go inside.

332
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:06,461
So if we access this C's world from in here,

333
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:08,152
Lelouch will be his old self?

334
00:23:08,244 --> 00:23:10,744
It's a possibility, not a guarantee.

335
00:23:10,785 --> 00:23:11,531
Great.

336
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,995
Should it not work, well...

337
00:23:15,432 --> 00:23:17,693
There's a faint glimmer of hope.

338
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,465
Let's focus on that.

339
00:23:32,969 --> 00:23:34,769
Dissenters and terrorists, huh?

340
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,036
Why the lower block?

341
00:23:37,061 --> 00:23:38,931
I'll thank you to keep this between us,

342
00:23:38,956 --> 00:23:43,779
but these malcontents gave our forces more trouble
than they're worth and are slated for execution.

343
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,268
What's his story?

344
00:23:45,334 --> 00:23:47,880
That one? Brain's been fried by drugs.

345
00:24:04,334 --> 00:24:06,626
Oh, ho! Fresh meat!

346
00:24:06,742 --> 00:24:08,739
What're you pretties in for?

347
00:24:08,787 --> 00:24:09,789
Hey, ladies!

348
00:24:10,331 --> 00:24:11,790
Wanna have some fun?

349
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:13,500
Ditch the boyfriend!

350
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,123
Better yet, bring him over here!

351
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,848
Right, Dr. Lloyd.

352
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:23,906
We're inside.

353
00:24:23,931 --> 00:24:26,123
I'd like to make our move before the strip search.

354
00:24:26,158 --> 00:24:27,357
How are the cameras?

355
00:24:29,847 --> 00:24:32,039
How unfortunate, it's just fine.

356
00:24:32,064 --> 00:24:34,496
I've already replaced it with a fake image.

357
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,659
This is good. You can stop.

358
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,576
What d'ya mean this is good?

359
00:24:41,414 --> 00:24:42,452
Son of a...

360
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,500
We appreciate the escort.

361
00:24:48,129 --> 00:24:49,314
Whoa. What the hell?

362
00:24:49,339 --> 00:24:51,020
The new kids have really done it now.

363
00:24:51,045 --> 00:24:52,591
Heh. Jackasses!

364
00:24:52,864 --> 00:24:55,814
Believe me. You're never getting outta here.

365
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:57,864
Guards! You seein' this?

366
00:25:03,953 --> 00:25:04,930
What is this?

367
00:25:04,955 --> 00:25:07,039
You're just throwing me the damn keycard?

368
00:25:07,064 --> 00:25:10,136
Yes, and what you do with it is your business.

369
00:25:10,264 --> 00:25:12,055
You breakin' us outta this joint?

370
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:13,382
Aw, right!

371
00:25:15,261 --> 00:25:16,811
This is gonna be good!

372
00:25:16,874 --> 00:25:18,757
What are we waiting for? Let's do it!

373
00:25:18,782 --> 00:25:19,919
Death to the guards!

374
00:25:19,944 --> 00:25:22,658
Not sure if that was a good idea, but it buys us time.

375
00:25:22,683 --> 00:25:25,932
Very well, and the Aramu Gate
is located on this level, yes?

376
00:25:26,031 --> 00:25:28,161
Lower. We have to go farther down.

377
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,901
According to my information,

378
00:25:29,976 --> 00:25:32,295
it was once part of an underground aquifer.

379
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,570
It's no longer used,

380
00:25:33,595 --> 00:25:36,052
but I see no reason for them to have destroyed it.

381
00:25:41,967 --> 00:25:42,844
Huh?

382
00:25:47,328 --> 00:25:50,426
Hmm. Well, that's unfortunate.

383
00:26:27,495 --> 00:26:29,989
What is this? A dead end?

384
00:26:31,326 --> 00:26:34,326
Uh, please tell me that's not the thing we're looking for.

385
00:26:34,351 --> 00:26:36,814
It's submerged under groundwater.

386
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,167
Which actually improves our odds.

387
00:26:39,626 --> 00:26:42,621
It's been too inaccessible for anyone to disengage.

388
00:26:57,629 --> 00:26:58,677
We're in luck.

389
00:26:58,837 --> 00:27:01,420
The system's engineer built it to last.

390
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:02,913
That is impressive.

391
00:27:02,938 --> 00:27:05,691
Is it stupid of me to ask where all the water's going?

392
00:27:06,814 --> 00:27:10,801
Okay. Hey, no worries. There's
nothing to be afraid... of...

393
00:27:11,989 --> 00:27:16,475
Okay, then. You don't have to stare at me
like a wounded animal. I was just trying to...

394
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,454
What is it?

395
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,876
The prison's water volume has increased.

396
00:27:32,969 --> 00:27:35,887
Ministry of the Interior wants us to check the floodgates.

397
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:39,412
Hmph. Isn't that Warden Bitool's responsibility?

398
00:27:39,684 --> 00:27:41,726
Well, sir, there's been an incident.

399
00:27:41,776 --> 00:27:43,213
Emergency protocols are in effect...

400
00:27:43,238 --> 00:27:44,373
I'm well aware!

401
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:50,416
Huh. It would appear that our unwanted guests
appreciate plumbing more than Knightmare Frames.

402
00:28:00,867 --> 00:28:03,255
C.C., you sure you got this?

403
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,489
Yes. Stay there and keep watch.

404
00:28:05,514 --> 00:28:06,149
On it.

405
00:28:06,623 --> 00:28:07,629
Miss Kallen?

406
00:28:07,654 --> 00:28:09,086
Yeah? What do you need?

407
00:28:09,249 --> 00:28:13,400
Ma'am, I think it would be prudent for me to
monitor the riot and secure our route of escape.

408
00:28:13,803 --> 00:28:15,234
Sounds like a plan.

409
00:28:15,467 --> 00:28:16,657
I'll return shortly.

410
00:28:18,795 --> 00:28:21,521
Wherever you are, Lelouch, come back.

411
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:42,697
Try to relax. It's for the best.

412
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:44,495
With luck you'll be whole again.

413
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:30,235
I believe it's safe to say we made it in.

414
00:29:32,142 --> 00:29:33,108
What's going on?

415
00:29:33,436 --> 00:29:36,019
Why are these poor souls frozen in place?

416
00:29:49,036 --> 00:29:51,484
Lo, she rises. My Lady?

417
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:53,345
There has been no change.

418
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,594
Is this attachment or absent longing?

419
00:29:55,778 --> 00:29:57,100
Absent longing?

420
00:29:58,071 --> 00:29:59,754
Forgive me, Princess Shamna!

421
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,977
Yes, of course. That's it.

422
00:30:23,002 --> 00:30:25,241
The remnants of what you left behind.

423
00:30:25,266 --> 00:30:28,591
Desires, aspirations they've created a natural barrier.

424
00:30:28,915 --> 00:30:29,896
Well, then.

425
00:30:29,921 --> 00:30:32,284
Nunnally will have to be utilized after all.

426
00:30:34,473 --> 00:30:35,972
All right, ya animals!

427
00:30:35,997 --> 00:30:38,059
At least try to act civilized.

428
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,824
How many intruders are we lookin' at?

429
00:30:39,849 --> 00:30:41,056
Hard to say, Warden.

430
00:30:41,081 --> 00:30:43,254
Far as we can tell, it's just the few we saw

431
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,243
when we were playing prisoner in the cell block.

432
00:30:45,268 --> 00:30:47,685
Say what? They don't even make a half a dozen!

433
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,646
What the hell are they trying to accomplish?

434
00:30:49,671 --> 00:30:52,168
All we know is they're headed for the aquifer.

435
00:30:52,303 --> 00:30:55,013
Great. Somethin' down there for them to give a damn about?

436
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:57,325
Just the temple from before the relocation.

437
00:30:57,462 --> 00:30:59,921
So they're probably casing all the lower floors.

438
00:30:59,946 --> 00:31:02,660
Right! Plan: We let 'em make
their way to the bottom level,

439
00:31:02,685 --> 00:31:04,421
then stamp 'em out like insects.

440
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:08,043
Tell the elites to stand by and we'll
try not to tear the place up too much.

441
00:31:08,068 --> 00:31:12,393
And by elite, sir, I'm guessing you mean the
great, honorable captain of the royal guard?

442
00:31:12,418 --> 00:31:15,306
Don't be cute. His ass gets kissed enough.

443
00:31:16,671 --> 00:31:17,687
Stand by?

444
00:31:17,712 --> 00:31:21,114
Sir, Warden Bitool maintains that
due to the building's unique design,

445
00:31:21,139 --> 00:31:23,528
he and his men are better equipped to handle this.

446
00:31:23,739 --> 00:31:25,488
Man's a glorified thief...

447
00:31:25,628 --> 00:31:27,982
one who would do well to remember his place.

448
00:31:37,534 --> 00:31:38,518
Sayoko!

449
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,195
What are you doing bringing a Knightmare down here?

450
00:31:41,237 --> 00:31:43,824
Yes, yes. I know. Too bulky.

451
00:31:43,967 --> 00:31:47,674
Let's just say we stumbled on something
that'll shake things up a little.

452
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:49,872
What happens if the prisoners get their hands on this?

453
00:31:49,897 --> 00:31:51,015
Did you think about...

454
00:31:51,254 --> 00:31:52,252
Oh, crap.

455
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:52,963
Exactly.

456
00:31:52,988 --> 00:31:54,750
Turns out they're not prisoners at all.

457
00:31:54,775 --> 00:31:56,483
This whole thing has been a charade.

458
00:31:56,508 --> 00:31:58,367
Damn it. I'll buy us some time!

459
00:31:58,406 --> 00:32:00,112
Keep an eye on C.C. and Lelouch!

460
00:32:00,137 --> 00:32:03,606
All right. I don't know what you expect me to do, though.

461
00:32:04,227 --> 00:32:09,041
Huh. I suppose this is a rather
good subject for scientific research.

462
00:32:11,405 --> 00:32:13,071
I live for this stuff.

463
00:32:13,123 --> 00:32:14,322
Right there with ya.

464
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:16,283
Glad the security system didn't get 'em.

465
00:32:16,308 --> 00:32:19,442
Neither of you fellas were around
for the big manhunt last week, were you?

466
00:32:19,467 --> 00:32:21,592
Hell, I'll take this over that any day.

467
00:32:21,626 --> 00:32:23,617
I love me a redhead!

468
00:32:25,501 --> 00:32:27,579
Ooh! Firing without warning?

469
00:32:27,707 --> 00:32:30,013
Gotta say, I like your style!

470
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:36,406
A Ghedo Vakka! Oh, crap!

471
00:32:36,553 --> 00:32:39,704
Bursting through the floor like a ground hog! Nice one!

472
00:32:44,503 --> 00:32:47,513
I hate to do this, but I really don't have a choice.

473
00:32:53,491 --> 00:32:54,658
Come in, Control!

474
00:32:54,683 --> 00:32:56,940
There's been a collapse. We need backup, stat!

475
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:59,501
Hold your fire! I can't hear!

476
00:32:59,607 --> 00:33:02,009
The hell is going on with this thing?

477
00:33:02,466 --> 00:33:04,408
Son of a... They're jammin' us!

478
00:33:11,941 --> 00:33:14,612
Give me break. I can barely see anything!

479
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,069
My compliments, friend!

480
00:33:19,094 --> 00:33:21,420
Not bad for an unfamiliar machine!

481
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:32,225
Charles,

482
00:33:32,546 --> 00:33:35,368
why have you become a wedge between worlds?

483
00:33:36,042 --> 00:33:38,097
Is this Lelouch's doing?

484
00:33:38,378 --> 00:33:39,712
Because he...

485
00:33:46,135 --> 00:33:47,296
Lelouch!

486
00:33:48,801 --> 00:33:51,097
No! Take my hand!

487
00:33:55,402 --> 00:33:57,563
We can't keep using our Knightmares!

488
00:33:57,588 --> 00:33:58,348
No kidding!

489
00:33:58,373 --> 00:34:00,107
At this rate we'll be buried alive!

490
00:34:01,824 --> 00:34:02,415
Over there!

491
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,196
Miss Kallen!

492
00:34:03,221 --> 00:34:04,860
You picked the wrong day...

493
00:34:11,318 --> 00:34:13,240
Yeah, I'd surrender if I were you.

494
00:34:13,295 --> 00:34:16,413
Next one I toss your way's a
bomb that'll blow us both to Hell.

495
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,192
Come in, Warden Bitool.

496
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,927
We've lost contact with the outside.

497
00:34:19,952 --> 00:34:21,337
The visitor cut us off.

498
00:34:21,362 --> 00:34:22,779
Take a look below you.

499
00:34:22,804 --> 00:34:24,512
I, uh, don't see anything.

500
00:34:24,578 --> 00:34:27,036
I know! That's exactly what's bothering me!

501
00:34:27,071 --> 00:34:28,123
Understood!

502
00:34:28,176 --> 00:34:30,916
Now then, where were we, my little spitfire?

503
00:34:31,004 --> 00:34:33,129
Oh, right! We were about to have some fun!

504
00:34:33,184 --> 00:34:36,768
So, uh, you with the Federation or the Black Knights?

505
00:34:40,722 --> 00:34:42,660
Where are you? Where are you?

506
00:34:42,685 --> 00:34:43,897
Call out to me!

507
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:48,361
Are these lost souls or Refrain?

508
00:34:49,751 --> 00:34:51,209
Listen to me, Charles!

509
00:34:51,435 --> 00:34:55,554
Stop holding on and let Lelouch go free! Please!

510
00:35:01,665 --> 00:35:02,534
Nothing.

511
00:35:03,757 --> 00:35:05,590
Send a message to Shesthaal.

512
00:35:05,642 --> 00:35:08,140
Tell him to receive the master should he find her.

513
00:35:08,867 --> 00:35:12,261
I suspect that she may be of some
assistance with the new gateway.

514
00:35:12,496 --> 00:35:13,748
Namjala latak.

515
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:25,472
Oh, no! What's left of his consciousness will be consumed!

516
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:28,330
Lelouch! We have to get out of here!

517
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,559
Welcome back, young lady.

518
00:35:59,682 --> 00:36:01,540
May I ask what you're doing?

519
00:36:02,735 --> 00:36:03,782
Who are you?

520
00:36:04,254 --> 00:36:06,187
Next time you break into a man's castle,

521
00:36:06,212 --> 00:36:08,115
you really oughtta do your research.

522
00:36:10,286 --> 00:36:12,841
Huh. Guess that clears up the main point.

523
00:36:12,866 --> 00:36:15,015
You're definitely the one we're looking for.

524
00:36:15,332 --> 00:36:17,564
Is it true immortality, or what?

525
00:36:17,866 --> 00:36:19,615
How do you know who I am?

526
00:36:27,088 --> 00:36:30,026
Ho, ho! A complete Southern Cross!

527
00:36:30,206 --> 00:36:32,766
Should we try acid next, or blow her up?

528
00:36:33,229 --> 00:36:35,654
Hey. Don't worry, we're not gonna leave you guys out.

529
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:36,691
Break their arms.

530
00:36:37,835 --> 00:36:40,915
Ah... All finished healing yourself, are ya?

531
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:42,905
Why don't you and me cut a deal.

532
00:36:42,946 --> 00:36:44,613
You tell me what you're doing here

533
00:36:44,638 --> 00:36:47,853
and I won't bring the roof down
on everybody's head. Sound fair?

534
00:36:47,878 --> 00:36:50,676
This... was a dead end after all.

535
00:36:52,466 --> 00:36:55,019
No. On the contrary...

536
00:37:02,449 --> 00:37:04,745
You put your body on the line for me again,

537
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:07,416
just like you did before at Narita.

538
00:37:08,207 --> 00:37:12,594
Even though you can't die that doesn't
mean that your pain is any less of a sacrifice.

539
00:37:12,694 --> 00:37:14,618
Where'd this idiot come from?

540
00:37:28,114 --> 00:37:29,562
Hold on! You can't...

541
00:37:29,772 --> 00:37:32,689
I thought you were supposed to be dead! Weird.

542
00:37:32,889 --> 00:37:33,548
Heh.

543
00:37:34,789 --> 00:37:38,837
I see! They had you hidden away in here this whole time!

544
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,740
You're in exile! Except that doesn't make sense.

545
00:37:41,873 --> 00:37:45,927
Ah, either way, I admire you for being
able to pull off such a massive lie!

546
00:37:46,012 --> 00:37:47,345
Should I be grateful?

547
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:49,787
I certainly don't admire men like you.

548
00:37:49,924 --> 00:37:52,710
Aw, please. Come on, are you that dumb?

549
00:37:52,735 --> 00:37:55,139
You can't run your mouth like that when you're unarmed!

550
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:57,414
Emperor Lelouch was supposed to be smart!

551
00:37:57,439 --> 00:38:00,129
Unarmed? I'm afraid you're mistaken,

552
00:38:00,572 --> 00:38:03,562
as my direct subordinates would no doubt tell you.

553
00:38:05,605 --> 00:38:07,752
Lelouch vi Britannia commands you...

554
00:38:08,439 --> 00:38:11,927
...to kill yourself, right here, right now!

555
00:38:12,114 --> 00:38:17,714
The only people dying here today, pal, are
you and your so-called direct subordinates...

556
00:38:21,055 --> 00:38:22,920
Namjala latak.

557
00:38:23,547 --> 00:38:25,164
Namjala latak.

558
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:34,934
Hey! What the hell is goin' on down there? Hey!

559
00:38:44,064 --> 00:38:46,530
We have quite a bit to talk about, you and I.

560
00:38:46,822 --> 00:38:48,645
It's been awhile, but I'm back.

561
00:38:48,748 --> 00:38:52,268
I can see that. Good to have you with us, Lelouch.

562
00:38:54,497 --> 00:38:57,034
Bitool stopped responding? Why?

563
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,939
As you said sir, he's just a glorified thief.

564
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:01,561
I don't know what I expected.

565
00:39:02,082 --> 00:39:03,334
The man has no backbone.

566
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,416
At the first sign of real danger, he flees.

567
00:39:06,281 --> 00:39:08,703
Tch. We don't know what the intruders are up to.

568
00:39:08,728 --> 00:39:11,409
Could be anything. What do they want from me?

569
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:13,976
Not like I can use my Batalalan Du in here.

570
00:39:14,022 --> 00:39:16,864
Live to fight another day. That's my philosophy.

571
00:39:17,456 --> 00:39:19,082
We have a special plan for the lady?

572
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:22,099
Oh, normally I'd let you have
fun with her until I was through,

573
00:39:22,124 --> 00:39:25,993
but... no. Her? She'll be a gift. Ha!

574
00:39:26,098 --> 00:39:28,905
Go. Take her to the infirmary, now.

575
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:32,449
Master Lelouch?

576
00:39:32,474 --> 00:39:33,672
Yes, go ahead.

577
00:39:33,697 --> 00:39:36,051
Miss Kallen is being transported to the infirmary.

578
00:39:36,105 --> 00:39:37,606
Probably on the fourth level.

579
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,566
Also...

580
00:39:39,172 --> 00:39:40,399
Please continue.

581
00:39:40,473 --> 00:39:43,243
Command of the operation is being
turned over to the royal guard.

582
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:44,724
Is that so?

583
00:39:44,765 --> 00:39:45,349
Yes.

584
00:39:45,673 --> 00:39:47,632
They're holding their position on the outside.

585
00:39:48,044 --> 00:39:50,597
Very well. We'll switch the mission to Zebra.

586
00:39:50,656 --> 00:39:51,803
As you wish, sir.

587
00:39:53,197 --> 00:39:55,247
I take it there's an internal conflict?

588
00:39:55,523 --> 00:39:57,967
This move suggests a territorial dispute.

589
00:39:58,131 --> 00:40:00,339
It's a nation ruled by siblings.

590
00:40:00,422 --> 00:40:02,297
The sister acts as religious leader,

591
00:40:02,322 --> 00:40:03,755
the brother heads the military.

592
00:40:04,961 --> 00:40:08,089
One generally hatches an escape plan before breaking in.

593
00:40:09,305 --> 00:40:12,822
Your Excellency, I have control of the system. We're up!

594
00:40:12,847 --> 00:40:14,645
Well done. Thank you, Lloyd.

595
00:40:15,064 --> 00:40:17,356
What do you think is being kept in this area?

596
00:40:17,506 --> 00:40:20,011
You've made note of the anomaly, too, I see.

597
00:40:20,098 --> 00:40:22,543
One last person is being held there.

598
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:26,043
Will they try to move him out or
will they just leave him down there?

599
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:30,257
Evidently he's too vital a piece for them to risk losing.

600
00:40:53,006 --> 00:40:54,253
My apologies.

601
00:40:54,297 --> 00:40:56,694
It wasn't my intention to disturb you, Zero.

602
00:40:56,947 --> 00:40:59,309
You still need plenty of rest to recuperate.

603
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,637
The doctor tells me you'll be fine

604
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:06,326
provided you don't push yourself.

605
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:09,643
Incidentally you being here keeps the enemy in check.

606
00:41:11,514 --> 00:41:12,906
We have the advantage,

607
00:41:13,072 --> 00:41:15,737
though I will of course need your help to secure an exit.

608
00:41:16,622 --> 00:41:17,487
Lelouch?

609
00:41:17,939 --> 00:41:18,743
Yes?

610
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:21,447
Is this a dream? Is it really you?

611
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:22,902
You should rest.

612
00:41:23,656 --> 00:41:24,476
You...

613
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,460
You... You're actually alive.

614
00:41:31,765 --> 00:41:33,474
So it would appear.

615
00:41:34,122 --> 00:41:35,208
Appear?

616
00:41:35,456 --> 00:41:38,201
Don't do that! Don't sound so detached!

617
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:40,755
Forgive me. Old habit.

618
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,253
Bastard!

619
00:41:42,389 --> 00:41:45,568
Why? How many times are you going to lie to me?!

620
00:41:46,356 --> 00:41:49,981
I won't make excuses. Do what you must.

621
00:41:51,397 --> 00:41:52,241
Damn you!

622
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,460
Do you have any guilt what you put us through?!

623
00:41:54,589 --> 00:41:58,091
The doubt?! The pain?! You're a coward!

624
00:41:58,155 --> 00:41:59,995
Why couldn't you have told us?

625
00:42:00,197 --> 00:42:02,410
Why? Tell me why!

626
00:42:02,435 --> 00:42:05,076
Suzaku, no! Stop this right now!

627
00:42:08,147 --> 00:42:10,572
Lelouch never wanted to come back from the dead!

628
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,906
He's here because I gave him no choice!

629
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:15,094
C.C.

630
00:42:20,097 --> 00:42:21,181
I'm impressed.

631
00:42:21,657 --> 00:42:24,206
That's quite an outburst for someone in your condition.

632
00:42:26,473 --> 00:42:27,890
Attention, intruders.

633
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:31,255
This is Captain Schesthall
Forgnar of the royal guard speaking.

634
00:42:31,414 --> 00:42:33,164
I serve the Divine.

635
00:42:33,272 --> 00:42:35,314
Your situation is hopeless.

636
00:42:35,414 --> 00:42:37,474
The facility is entirely surrounded.

637
00:42:39,106 --> 00:42:40,387
Surrender at once.

638
00:42:40,722 --> 00:42:43,393
There is no way out. Surrender at once.

639
00:42:43,964 --> 00:42:46,570
Nearly all prison personnel have been evacuated.

640
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:48,626
Comply before we are done or else.

641
00:42:48,989 --> 00:42:50,901
If you choose to ignore this warning

642
00:42:50,926 --> 00:42:53,253
then I cannot guarantee your survival.

643
00:42:53,382 --> 00:42:57,328
In addition, should the former member of
the Order come to us of her own volition,

644
00:42:57,436 --> 00:43:00,426
I've been given authority to
treat her as a guest of the state.

645
00:43:00,465 --> 00:43:01,733
Attractive offer.

646
00:43:02,063 --> 00:43:04,091
I wonder why they feel the need to make it.

647
00:43:04,116 --> 00:43:05,243
I couldn't say.

648
00:43:05,331 --> 00:43:08,416
This kingdom parted from the Order over 300 years ago.

649
00:43:08,814 --> 00:43:10,522
Who knows what happened to their founders?

650
00:43:10,581 --> 00:43:12,456
The program is done, Your Excellency.

651
00:43:12,481 --> 00:43:15,874
Designed around the Knightmare
Frame simulator, as requested.

652
00:43:15,948 --> 00:43:16,697
Communications?

653
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:18,160
Have a look for yourself.

654
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,674
They wish to speak with us?

655
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:22,803
Yes, sir. Please advise.

656
00:43:23,405 --> 00:43:25,568
Very well, then. Put them through.

657
00:43:27,106 --> 00:43:29,464
Attention, Shesthaal Forgnar.

658
00:43:29,972 --> 00:43:32,774
Attention, Shesthaal Forgnar.

659
00:43:33,272 --> 00:43:35,237
We are tourists, nothing more.

660
00:43:35,623 --> 00:43:39,324
Kindly remove your cordon and leave the area immediately.

661
00:43:40,949 --> 00:43:43,318
How dare you presume to speak to me this way.

662
00:43:43,343 --> 00:43:46,212
Your lack of deference is an insult to my family!

663
00:43:46,237 --> 00:43:46,943
Really?

664
00:43:47,431 --> 00:43:50,485
Who knew the son a merchant
clan would have such thin skin?

665
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:54,202
The Forgnars must've forgotten their
roots over the last century or so.

666
00:43:54,339 --> 00:43:56,547
Please accept my sincerest apologies.

667
00:43:56,715 --> 00:43:58,214
I didn't know you were proud.

668
00:43:58,239 --> 00:43:58,891
Gah.

669
00:43:59,648 --> 00:44:01,620
If you happen to also be smart,

670
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:03,076
you'll do as I suggest.

671
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:04,436
Fair warning.

672
00:44:06,365 --> 00:44:08,758
All personnel prepare for battle!

673
00:44:08,783 --> 00:44:11,366
We'll neutralize them from the ground level down!

674
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:13,199
Can't say I didn't try.

675
00:44:13,923 --> 00:44:14,699
Suzaku?

676
00:44:14,724 --> 00:44:16,372
I know, I know.

677
00:44:16,848 --> 00:44:18,264
You really have come back.

678
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:21,220
Whoa! Hold on! What are you doing?

679
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:23,549
You can't pilot that scrap heap in your condition!

680
00:44:23,574 --> 00:44:26,439
Calm down. I'm Zero. It's my job.

681
00:44:27,163 --> 00:44:29,781
Sacrificing myself is what I signed on for.

682
00:44:29,873 --> 00:44:31,228
A noble sentiment,

683
00:44:31,253 --> 00:44:34,478
but it also happens to make
you a profound pain in the rear.

684
00:44:34,503 --> 00:44:35,383
I'm sorry.

685
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:38,197
If you know another way to get
us out of this, I'm all ears.

686
00:44:38,222 --> 00:44:40,778
Till then, this is the only thing I know how to do.

687
00:44:43,007 --> 00:44:43,941
Huh?

688
00:44:45,247 --> 00:44:49,406
All apologies, but it seem I require your assistance.

689
00:44:50,456 --> 00:44:52,589
Lelouch vi Britannia commands you.

690
00:45:02,936 --> 00:45:04,136
Thank you, Sayoko.

691
00:45:04,198 --> 00:45:05,445
Glad I made it in time.

692
00:45:06,022 --> 00:45:07,795
We have to get back and guard Doctor Lloyd.

693
00:45:23,263 --> 00:45:26,362
If she is a master, withstanding
this ought not be a problem.

694
00:45:26,398 --> 00:45:27,449
We shall see.

695
00:45:28,131 --> 00:45:30,520
Move in, now. Secure all levels.

696
00:45:30,545 --> 00:45:33,151
Engage the enemy in the name of Forgnar!

697
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:34,580
Namjala latek.

698
00:45:34,656 --> 00:45:35,414
Hmph.

699
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:40,234
Be honest. There's no way this is gonna work.

700
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,934
Do as I say and it will.

701
00:45:42,507 --> 00:45:45,143
Your confidence isn't exactly reassuring.

702
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:48,201
Then trust in my strategy!

703
00:45:56,209 --> 00:45:58,919
They've closed off the only entrance. How quaint.

704
00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:05,653
P9, keep backing away.

705
00:46:05,678 --> 00:46:08,299
P2 and B4, rendezvous with R and draw them in!

706
00:46:08,406 --> 00:46:11,203
All personnel, continue taking control of each floor.

707
00:46:11,228 --> 00:46:12,979
Madin, maintain position.

708
00:46:13,004 --> 00:46:15,671
Guard the bridge-laying tank en route from Ablaq Base.

709
00:46:15,696 --> 00:46:17,672
K1, move into action!

710
00:46:20,187 --> 00:46:23,706
A Ghedo Vakka? Ignore it. Merely a decoy!

711
00:46:23,894 --> 00:46:26,602
Perfect. Just what I want them to think.

712
00:46:26,822 --> 00:46:28,816
What a joke. Is this all they've got?

713
00:46:29,091 --> 00:46:31,124
Heh. Keep running the enemy down!

714
00:46:31,709 --> 00:46:34,220
Q Team, you have two minutes to wrap it up.

715
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:37,046
He talks big, but he's an incompetent fool.

716
00:46:37,071 --> 00:46:38,787
K1, lure them in.

717
00:46:40,742 --> 00:46:42,735
Captain, the captured Knightmare has fled.

718
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,217
It's moving to the lower level.

719
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:48,016
Excellent! Press the attack!
It will lead us to our quarry!

720
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:51,764
These bandits are nothing against a superior bloodline!

721
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:53,758
K1, proceed as planned.

722
00:47:01,943 --> 00:47:04,554
Show yourself, impudent fool! Face me!

723
00:47:05,939 --> 00:47:06,953
Now, Zero,

724
00:47:06,978 --> 00:47:08,796
if you're entertaining any thought of escape,

725
00:47:08,821 --> 00:47:11,783
permit me to remind you what will become of our hostage.

726
00:47:12,667 --> 00:47:14,995
Captain Shesthaal of the royal guard,

727
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:17,323
it seems your pride was unearned.

728
00:47:17,348 --> 00:47:18,932
Too bad, it was fun.

729
00:47:18,957 --> 00:47:20,394
Check and mate.

730
00:47:22,051 --> 00:47:23,383
You son of a bitch!

731
00:47:23,513 --> 00:47:27,602
Father...

732
00:47:30,951 --> 00:47:33,428
What the...? My precious Sakuradite!

733
00:47:41,845 --> 00:47:44,435
Hello, Kallen. I'm pleased to see you...

734
00:47:45,016 --> 00:47:46,094
Master Lelouch.

735
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:47,119
Yes, what?

736
00:47:47,144 --> 00:47:50,546
Sir, don't you think it would be wise
to deal with the other staff members?

737
00:47:50,665 --> 00:47:53,191
Indeed. Let us turn them all loose.

738
00:47:53,955 --> 00:47:56,883
I've released them from the Geass. They're free to go.

739
00:47:59,022 --> 00:48:00,898
Something about you is different.

740
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:03,366
Hm. Quite possibly.

741
00:48:04,312 --> 00:48:07,198
Anyway, we'll cross the border
at a village called Lodus...

742
00:48:07,223 --> 00:48:08,926
No. That won't work.

743
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,833
Why not?

744
00:48:09,858 --> 00:48:13,261
Well, Lelouch can't run the risk
of being publicly rescued, can he?

745
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,108
Right. Of course.

746
00:48:16,133 --> 00:48:18,812
Besides, I'm not finished here yet.

747
00:48:19,228 --> 00:48:22,662
They're holding Nunnally hostage. The damn fools.

748
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:35,859
Your Highness. It is I, Forgnar.

749
00:48:35,898 --> 00:48:39,356
I've been given to understand King Shalio is in residence?

750
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:40,808
Let him enter.

751
00:48:43,303 --> 00:48:45,234
Most Gracious Majesty,

752
00:48:45,286 --> 00:48:48,958
word has reached me that my
son, Shesthaal, has been slain.

753
00:48:48,983 --> 00:48:50,044
Is this true?

754
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:52,834
Yes, Warden Bitool confirmed it.

755
00:48:53,241 --> 00:48:54,571
My condolences.

756
00:48:54,596 --> 00:48:57,819
Bitool, when may I ask did Shesthaal perish?

757
00:48:58,171 --> 00:49:01,088
Midday, Your Highness. Around eleven o'clock, I would say.

758
00:49:01,113 --> 00:49:04,437
We had no idea their ring leader
would be such a formidable foe.

759
00:49:04,462 --> 00:49:05,304
I see.

760
00:49:05,352 --> 00:49:08,126
That would put the time of death at six hours ago.

761
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:09,387
What of it?

762
00:49:09,573 --> 00:49:10,492
My king.

763
00:49:10,938 --> 00:49:14,786
I beseech you for orders. The Federation dogs must pay.

764
00:49:14,925 --> 00:49:19,227
Please, let me hunt down the Black Knights
responsible and tear them limb from limb!

765
00:49:19,555 --> 00:49:20,764
Generalissimo.

766
00:49:20,789 --> 00:49:21,684
Highness.

767
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:23,808
Your military might is undeniable,

768
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,125
but the enemy may be in league
with one who possesses Geass.

769
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:28,774
Your Highness, with respect,

770
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,033
we don't this is related to the master I met.

771
00:49:31,058 --> 00:49:33,583
Nonetheless, we must prepare for the worst.

772
00:49:33,608 --> 00:49:35,571
Forgive me. Yes, Your Highness.

773
00:49:35,596 --> 00:49:38,387
Sister, if they do in fact have a Geass...

774
00:49:38,448 --> 00:49:39,564
Worry not.

775
00:49:39,754 --> 00:49:42,752
I have the gift of prophecy with which to thwart them.

776
00:49:43,078 --> 00:49:45,138
But even when we captured Zero...

777
00:49:45,626 --> 00:49:48,729
Put that out of your mind. Focus on our advantage.

778
00:49:50,408 --> 00:49:52,924
Hapless girl. Caught in the middle.

779
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,331
Your wavelength so closely aligned to Charles.

780
00:49:56,671 --> 00:49:59,921
Your brother decimated the principals of C's world.

781
00:49:59,969 --> 00:50:02,562
Having done so, he will soon become the means

782
00:50:02,587 --> 00:50:07,006
by which I transcend the limitations he himself could not.

783
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,618
Implicating Zilkhstan in Nunnally's
abduction is nothing to be impulsive about.

784
00:50:16,011 --> 00:50:19,842
I trust the report given to
us by Lloyd and Agent Shinozaki.

785
00:50:20,515 --> 00:50:24,592
I'm a little insulted you'd go to
the Earl of Pudding before coming to me.

786
00:50:24,617 --> 00:50:25,710
As a matter of fact,

787
00:50:25,735 --> 00:50:28,837
I'd be honored to have you
onboard as my technical advisor.

788
00:50:28,887 --> 00:50:31,921
Tch. None of this makes sense.

789
00:50:32,122 --> 00:50:36,602
Why would such a small, backwater country
insist on turning the whole world against them?

790
00:50:36,812 --> 00:50:39,588
I'm not so sure their motives are entirely political.

791
00:50:39,613 --> 00:50:41,890
One report in particular gives me pause.

792
00:50:41,915 --> 00:50:44,905
Huh. And you can't share the details?

793
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:49,288
The problem is, we've reason to
believe someone involved has a Geass.

794
00:50:49,313 --> 00:50:52,166
That would explain why you
called in Shanti and the others.

795
00:50:52,191 --> 00:50:53,121
Precisely.

796
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:54,920
I thought it best if the one who brought

797
00:50:54,945 --> 00:50:58,434
these child prodigies together in the
first place could be the one to figure it out.

798
00:50:58,911 --> 00:50:59,747
Hey, sis?

799
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:02,974
I sent that Frame Coat to Pudding like you asked me to.

800
00:51:02,999 --> 00:51:04,614
You don't mean the Lancelot?

801
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:07,826
Are we not concerned that unit
will be seen as a symbol of tyranny?

802
00:51:07,851 --> 00:51:09,351
Was that the wrong choice?

803
00:51:09,397 --> 00:51:12,994
Sorry, I thought it necessary, provided Zero is safe.

804
00:51:13,019 --> 00:51:15,522
It was absolutely the wrong choice.

805
00:51:15,547 --> 00:51:17,146
Send a different set.

806
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,243
If you say so. Shanti?

807
00:51:19,585 --> 00:51:23,528
I know. I had a feeling you'd say
that, so I already sent another one.

808
00:51:35,211 --> 00:51:37,168
I hope they don't find out.

809
00:51:37,193 --> 00:51:39,505
We may be over the border, but still.

810
00:51:39,575 --> 00:51:42,241
The region lives in fear of Princess Cornelia.

811
00:51:42,292 --> 00:51:43,281
Not only that.

812
00:51:43,323 --> 00:51:47,055
They owe their chief source of
income to thievery and espionage.

813
00:51:48,478 --> 00:51:51,435
And of course it doesn't hurt they're able to use Geass.

814
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:54,496
A shrewd hiding place. His Excellency is cautious.

815
00:51:54,745 --> 00:51:57,957
We really must come up with
something else for you to call him.

816
00:51:58,462 --> 00:52:01,617
I agree. Wouldn't want word to get out he's alive.

817
00:52:04,736 --> 00:52:06,734
The only ones who should kill

818
00:52:07,031 --> 00:52:09,406
are those who are prepared to be killed.

819
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:14,582
Consequently, the world is not mine to change.

820
00:52:16,576 --> 00:52:17,825
At the end of the day,

821
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:22,804
Lelouch vi Britannia forfeited that right
the moment he turned his back on existence.

822
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,604
The only reason I've chosen to don the persona...

823
00:52:27,949 --> 00:52:30,220
is to save Suzaku and Nunnally.

824
00:52:33,044 --> 00:52:35,225
For that, and that alone,

825
00:52:35,853 --> 00:52:38,033
I will once more become Zero.

826
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:52,946
Wonder what that's all about.

827
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,042
Something must be keeping C.C. busy.

828
00:52:55,578 --> 00:52:56,448
Shirley!

829
00:52:57,006 --> 00:52:59,143
Prez! How was Zilkhstan?

830
00:52:59,597 --> 00:53:01,055
Complete waste of time.

831
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,635
They couldn't even be bothered
to give me decent press access.

832
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:04,551
I don't know what happened,

833
00:53:04,576 --> 00:53:07,672
but things got kinda dicey so
we decided to come back home.

834
00:53:07,697 --> 00:53:09,613
Oh, well, you definitely made the right call.

835
00:53:09,638 --> 00:53:10,798
Yeah, how's that?

836
00:53:10,823 --> 00:53:12,969
You haven't heard? It's all over the Internet.

837
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,856
They're locking up foreigners left and right.

838
00:53:14,881 --> 00:53:16,631
You're lucky you're not behind bars right now.

839
00:53:16,681 --> 00:53:17,346
Huh?

840
00:53:17,371 --> 00:53:20,288
Oh, man! Apparently they're gonna
start shutting down the airports!

841
00:53:20,548 --> 00:53:22,317
Hurry up and get inside!

842
00:53:31,029 --> 00:53:33,564
As a rule I pay rumors no mind.

843
00:53:33,659 --> 00:53:36,820
But it seems the ones about you
still kicking around were true.

844
00:53:37,368 --> 00:53:38,986
Hello, Lelouch.

845
00:53:39,397 --> 00:53:40,368
Suzaku.

846
00:53:40,701 --> 00:53:42,727
You're on the run from Zilkhstan.

847
00:53:43,148 --> 00:53:46,271
Congratulations on making it to this little border town.

848
00:53:46,764 --> 00:53:50,542
Take it in. This is as far you go.

849
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:53,112
Turn around and leave or die.

850
00:53:53,137 --> 00:53:55,301
Sister, I must correct you.

851
00:53:55,655 --> 00:53:57,674
I'm not running from Zilkhstan.

852
00:53:58,072 --> 00:54:00,382
I've come here to join forces with you.

853
00:54:00,618 --> 00:54:02,618
Enough of your absurd talk!

854
00:54:02,756 --> 00:54:04,580
You will meet your end here again!

855
00:54:04,605 --> 00:54:05,676
Just a moment!

856
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:08,755
Are you really him? Zero?

857
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,129
Yes, he is.

858
00:54:10,825 --> 00:54:12,896
As surely as the sun will rise.

859
00:54:12,921 --> 00:54:15,946
Take it from us. We've seen him in action.

860
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:17,780
Master Lelouch,

861
00:54:17,964 --> 00:54:20,687
a message from Undersecretary Kannon, regarding backup:

862
00:54:20,864 --> 00:54:23,561
Additional Knightmares will be arriving by air soon.

863
00:54:23,586 --> 00:54:26,043
Good. Distasteful as it may be,

864
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:28,013
I'd like you to work under my orders.

865
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:29,460
We must rescue Nunnally.

866
00:54:29,878 --> 00:54:34,032
We believe she's being held either at the
Mu Base in the capital, the temple at Mefeng,

867
00:54:34,201 --> 00:54:36,078
or some comparable place in the area.

868
00:54:36,787 --> 00:54:39,646
We want Nunnally's safe return as badly as you,

869
00:54:39,914 --> 00:54:44,206
but... there are 12,000 enlisted
soldiers protecting the capital.

870
00:54:44,345 --> 00:54:47,723
Our forces are only 20 strong, if you count the civilians.

871
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:51,826
I can spare a reconnaissance team to
help you survey the field, but that's it.

872
00:54:51,851 --> 00:54:53,035
Take it or leave it.

873
00:54:53,517 --> 00:54:56,308
So basically the enemy outnumbers us by, what?

874
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:57,809
Uh, 600 to one.

875
00:54:58,325 --> 00:55:00,924
We wouldn't stand a chance! That's crazy!

876
00:55:00,949 --> 00:55:02,847
We barely have enough supplies to go around!

877
00:55:02,872 --> 00:55:04,151
It's a rescue mission.

878
00:55:04,281 --> 00:55:06,705
We don't need to kill all 12,000 of them.

879
00:55:06,972 --> 00:55:08,205
Is that right?

880
00:55:08,334 --> 00:55:10,125
You make it sound so easy.

881
00:55:10,364 --> 00:55:14,533
The Zilkhstan military once crushed
a Britannian army twice its size.

882
00:55:14,572 --> 00:55:17,193
They have the home advantage. This is their land.

883
00:55:17,218 --> 00:55:19,727
The fact we're even here is a tremendous risk.

884
00:55:19,867 --> 00:55:22,239
It would be far better to try the diplomatic route.

885
00:55:22,264 --> 00:55:23,072
Would it?

886
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:25,245
And how would that go without my help?

887
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:28,129
I'll ask you one last time.

888
00:55:28,644 --> 00:55:32,671
After taking so many lives, Euphie, Dalton and the rest,

889
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:36,149
you expect us to risk our necks for the likes of you?

890
00:55:36,174 --> 00:55:38,668
What entitles you to our help?

891
00:55:45,566 --> 00:55:48,421
I beg you. I can't do this without you.

892
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:51,918
I can't save Nunnally on my own.

893
00:55:52,581 --> 00:55:54,666
I need all the help I can get.

894
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,163
You're a selfish bastard.

895
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,590
If we go along with you...

896
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:00,876
Victory is certain.

897
00:56:01,158 --> 00:56:03,670
Is it, though? Can we trust you?

898
00:56:03,695 --> 00:56:05,824
I will never lie to you again, Cornelia.

899
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,158
There's no longer any need.

900
00:56:10,682 --> 00:56:14,490
I'm not so sure about Lelouch,
but I'll put my faith in Zero.

901
00:56:14,515 --> 00:56:15,438
Ohgi...

902
00:56:16,817 --> 00:56:19,213
I doubted him once and it didn't go well for me.

903
00:56:20,072 --> 00:56:23,030
If I could do it all over again, I'd trust him.

904
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,160
Same goes for me! I'm with Zero!

905
00:56:25,189 --> 00:56:27,763
Man's a miracle worker and that's all there is to it!

906
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:31,595
We may not share a mother,

907
00:56:31,667 --> 00:56:35,063
but Nunnally is without question my sisterâ my blood.

908
00:56:35,231 --> 00:56:37,732
As far as I'm concerned the only choice is to act!

909
00:56:37,764 --> 00:56:39,839
Indeed. Well said, Your Highness.

910
00:56:40,533 --> 00:56:41,523
Thank you.

911
00:56:43,373 --> 00:56:47,219
Woo-hoo! I think this alliance calls for a celebration!

912
00:56:47,271 --> 00:56:48,563
Yeah!

913
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:50,068
What are we waiting for?

914
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,676
A contribution to the cause in our capacity as civilians.

915
00:57:05,732 --> 00:57:07,295
Jeremiah Gottwald, sir.

916
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,091
It's both a pleasure and an honor.

917
00:57:09,289 --> 00:57:11,205
Oh, the lady is Anya Alstreim.

918
00:57:11,267 --> 00:57:13,529
Charmed, I'm sure. Nice to meet you.

919
00:57:13,554 --> 00:57:17,058
I'm guessing the extra Knightmares
Kannon sent came care of you?

920
00:57:17,083 --> 00:57:18,000
We can't thank you enough.

921
00:57:18,025 --> 00:57:20,950
Of course. It's the least we could
do to show our support for Lelouch.

922
00:57:20,975 --> 00:57:22,993
Appreciated. We'll give him our best, right?

923
00:57:23,018 --> 00:57:24,498
Yeah!

924
00:57:24,531 --> 00:57:25,952
Yeah!

925
00:57:27,006 --> 00:57:29,978
Yo, Guilford! How's it goin'? Heh.

926
00:57:30,169 --> 00:57:34,898
You stooping so low to make small talk
with the rabble, or you passin' out bribes?

927
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:38,184
No, no, I'm simply showing my appreciation.

928
00:57:38,508 --> 00:57:42,425
Heh! Those rats'd sell out their
homeland for a few greasy coins.

929
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:44,072
They have a right to survive.

930
00:57:44,105 --> 00:57:45,572
We can't fault them for that.

931
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,367
They do what they must.

932
00:57:47,951 --> 00:57:49,242
Don't you see?

933
00:57:49,306 --> 00:57:52,501
If I can bring the results I'm seeking back to the center,

934
00:57:52,608 --> 00:57:55,299
I'll be made in the shade, believe you me!

935
00:57:55,324 --> 00:57:56,994
I thought you were doing this for Suzaku.

936
00:57:57,019 --> 00:57:59,519
Heh, heh. That's another reason, sure.

937
00:57:59,544 --> 00:58:01,006
You don't have to explain.

938
00:58:01,069 --> 00:58:02,918
That's just the kind of person you are.

939
00:58:03,206 --> 00:58:05,575
Oh, really? You say that so offhand.

940
00:58:05,685 --> 00:58:07,568
You seem like you know him inside out.

941
00:58:07,656 --> 00:58:08,493
I do?

942
00:58:12,323 --> 00:58:13,823
Are you okay, Dr. Lloyd?

943
00:58:13,848 --> 00:58:17,056
Uh-oh. Did I make it too strong for you?

944
00:58:17,251 --> 00:58:20,596
I added in a Dragon's Breath
chili and a splash of orange liquor,

945
00:58:20,621 --> 00:58:23,050
and a dash of corn starch to give it body.

946
00:58:23,075 --> 00:58:25,092
It certainly has a unique smell.

947
00:58:25,533 --> 00:58:27,363
That's the fresh durian zest.

948
00:58:31,563 --> 00:58:34,618
You sure? Shouldn't you discuss it with Lelouch?

949
00:58:34,643 --> 00:58:35,802
I would, but...

950
00:58:35,827 --> 00:58:38,861
I don't have the faintest idea how to talk to him anymore.

951
00:58:39,976 --> 00:58:43,318
I wouldn't take it for granted that
you'll have the opportunity tomorrow.

952
00:58:43,343 --> 00:58:44,247
Mm?

953
00:58:44,545 --> 00:58:46,206
If there's something you need to tell him,

954
00:58:46,408 --> 00:58:47,465
don't put it off.

955
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,708
Why don't you take your own advice then?

956
00:58:50,745 --> 00:58:51,140
Oh?

957
00:58:51,417 --> 00:58:54,847
I guess being immortal makes procrastination okay?

958
00:59:00,492 --> 00:59:03,569
Lady Kaguya, she held onto this for you,

959
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,631
just in case you were still alive.

960
00:59:05,692 --> 00:59:06,334
Thank you.

961
00:59:07,311 --> 00:59:08,917
You surprise me, Ohgi.

962
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:11,354
I felt sure you'd be the last person to join.

963
00:59:12,356 --> 00:59:15,320
A topographical map of Zilkhstan. Useful.

964
00:59:15,859 --> 00:59:18,570
Excuse me. Thank you, Zero!

965
00:59:18,643 --> 00:59:19,929
I, uh...

966
00:59:20,227 --> 00:59:22,735
Japan wouldn't be what it is today without you.

967
00:59:23,094 --> 00:59:25,028
Please, consider this my apology...

968
00:59:25,053 --> 00:59:25,599
Stop.

969
00:59:27,515 --> 00:59:30,522
It's in the past. Water under the bridge.

970
00:59:35,349 --> 00:59:37,639
I'm glad you're all right, Kururugi.

971
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:40,694
Huh? Oh. Thank you very much.

972
00:59:41,709 --> 00:59:43,498
So now there are two Zeroes.

973
00:59:43,623 --> 00:59:44,958
For the time being.

974
00:59:45,659 --> 00:59:47,650
Well, you don't have to put it like that.

975
00:59:47,675 --> 00:59:50,585
I'm not trying to be dramatic. It's how things are.

976
00:59:50,848 --> 00:59:54,766
It's a small world. Even one Zero is a little much.

977
01:00:00,553 --> 01:00:02,910
Ah. I thought I'd find you here.

978
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:04,494
What are you doing?

979
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:06,544
Studying. Got something on your mind?

980
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,726
Two things, actually.

981
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:11,781
First off, Lelouch, since you're back,

982
01:00:11,818 --> 01:00:14,018
it's clear Zero should be you and you alone.

983
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:15,857
No. It belongs to you.

984
01:00:15,954 --> 01:00:19,347
C'mon, I'm a placeholder. That's all I'll ever be.

985
01:00:19,528 --> 01:00:22,853
Why's everyone doing that? I'm not back for good.

986
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:24,870
You're here in the flesh.

987
01:00:24,945 --> 01:00:26,457
What are we supposed to think?

988
01:00:26,932 --> 01:00:28,911
That I'm... just passing through.

989
01:00:28,936 --> 01:00:29,379
Uh...

990
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:32,257
I don't know the rules governing C's world.

991
01:00:32,814 --> 01:00:35,411
I'm a ghost. I could vanish tomorrow.

992
01:00:35,436 --> 01:00:36,698
Don't say that.

993
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,904
What was the other thing you wanted to say?

994
01:00:39,167 --> 01:00:42,820
Make it quick. I have a mission to be concerned with.

995
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:46,222
And you, my friend, need to conserve your energy.

996
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:49,550
What is it?

997
01:00:49,575 --> 01:00:52,283
Huh. The data Kaguya gave me.

998
01:00:58,591 --> 01:01:01,609
Ah. That's Ohgi's wedding reception.

999
01:01:01,763 --> 01:01:04,252
It was the first time we'd all been together since...

1000
01:01:06,397 --> 01:01:07,812
Don't throw your life away.

1001
01:01:07,837 --> 01:01:09,368
He means congratulations.

1002
01:01:09,393 --> 01:01:11,475
I mean my condolences!

1003
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,064
Mwah!

1004
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:15,171
That's it. I'm cutting you both off.

1005
01:01:15,726 --> 01:01:17,267
Sorry! Ignore that, please!

1006
01:01:17,361 --> 01:01:20,250
Who'd have ever thought Ohgi
and Villetta would end up together?

1007
01:01:20,275 --> 01:01:22,316
It's a good thing for a man to settle down.

1008
01:01:22,392 --> 01:01:24,225
Matrimony builds character.

1009
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:24,988
Hm.

1010
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:29,628
Who knows, perhaps one day I'll have the
honor of attending the reception of your wedding.

1011
01:01:29,729 --> 01:01:31,609
Oh, don't be silly.

1012
01:01:34,544 --> 01:01:36,369
You look so nice. I can't believe it.

1013
01:01:36,394 --> 01:01:38,346
You're a real live Cinderella story!

1014
01:01:38,637 --> 01:01:41,241
What is wrong with you? Just
let her enjoy her special day!

1015
01:01:41,373 --> 01:01:42,674
Real talk, though.

1016
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,346
You guys could afford a way bigger party than this, right?

1017
01:01:45,371 --> 01:01:46,283
Well, we didn't want...

1018
01:01:46,308 --> 01:01:48,951
Yes, allow me to offer my congratulations.

1019
01:01:48,976 --> 01:01:51,286
This is Kannon Maldini from the table in the back.

1020
01:01:51,311 --> 01:01:53,353
I don't believe we've had the pleasure of being...

1021
01:01:53,412 --> 01:01:54,846
You've outdone yourself.

1022
01:01:54,871 --> 01:01:57,416
The black forest cake is absolutely scrumptious.

1023
01:01:57,441 --> 01:01:59,378
Oh! Thank you!

1024
01:01:59,403 --> 01:02:00,916
Please excuse them, madam.

1025
01:02:00,941 --> 01:02:02,420
They're being too familiar.

1026
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:06,414
Oh, it's fine. There's no need for titles.

1027
01:02:09,274 --> 01:02:11,177
This is the world you saved.

1028
01:02:11,202 --> 01:02:13,037
Kaguya, thanks.

1029
01:02:13,323 --> 01:02:14,385
Lelouch,

1030
01:02:14,410 --> 01:02:16,738
the other thing I wanted to say was...

1031
01:02:18,633 --> 01:02:20,604
...I'm really glad you came back to us.

1032
01:02:22,231 --> 01:02:25,118
Oh, yeah? Our reunion was a little rough.

1033
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:29,799
A world without you is just less
interesting and a lot lonelier than I expected.

1034
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:32,739
Thank you for that.

1035
01:02:33,211 --> 01:02:34,689
Also, about Nunnally...

1036
01:02:34,714 --> 01:02:37,172
I'm aware. Believe me.

1037
01:02:37,242 --> 01:02:39,523
That's another reason we have to succeed.

1038
01:02:39,845 --> 01:02:41,149
With both of us together?

1039
01:02:41,445 --> 01:02:42,933
There's no way we won't win.

1040
01:02:43,044 --> 01:02:44,071
True enough...

1041
01:02:44,683 --> 01:02:45,910
True enough.

1042
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:56,864
Permits please,

1043
01:02:56,934 --> 01:02:58,882
and we'll need to have a look at your cargo.

1044
01:02:59,423 --> 01:03:01,888
The cargo is property of the Black Knights.

1045
01:03:02,891 --> 01:03:05,093
We'll be using it to blockade the capital.

1046
01:03:05,412 --> 01:03:07,218
For the remainder of this operation,

1047
01:03:07,243 --> 01:03:08,618
you will be answering to me.

1048
01:03:08,643 --> 01:03:10,838
What are you? Some kind of spy?

1049
01:03:17,094 --> 01:03:18,573
Namjala latak.

1050
01:03:28,879 --> 01:03:30,266
Listen very carefully.

1051
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:33,766
Your role in this is as follows,
we are on a rescue mission.

1052
01:03:34,331 --> 01:03:38,602
At midnight uprisings will break out at
four bases in the vicinity of the capital.

1053
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:40,860
Enemy communications will be jammed.

1054
01:03:41,664 --> 01:03:46,032
The squad flanking Cornelia will deploy
Knightmares and the like to keep the enemy off balance.

1055
01:03:46,272 --> 01:03:48,955
Based on their movements, Sayoko's team will be able

1056
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:51,666
to pinpoint the location where Nunnally is being held.

1057
01:03:52,019 --> 01:03:53,160
Understood, sir.

1058
01:03:53,403 --> 01:03:56,170
Suzaku and Kallen are already in position.

1059
01:03:57,511 --> 01:03:59,536
What's the verdict? Yours work?

1060
01:03:59,561 --> 01:04:01,425
It's been a while, but I can manage.

1061
01:04:01,592 --> 01:04:04,001
I'm actually more concerned about the additional armor.

1062
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:06,590
Well, we'll just have to use it and hope for the best.

1063
01:04:07,898 --> 01:04:09,127
What's so funny?

1064
01:04:09,152 --> 01:04:10,549
Just the way we're talking.

1065
01:04:10,895 --> 01:04:12,359
Never thought the day would come.

1066
01:04:15,472 --> 01:04:16,710
It's go time.

1067
01:04:27,289 --> 01:04:28,104
Good.

1068
01:04:28,582 --> 01:04:31,227
Whoever's behind this, make your move.

1069
01:04:31,615 --> 01:04:32,731
I'm waiting.

1070
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:35,768
Communications with Ajbeg Base have been cut off!

1071
01:04:35,988 --> 01:04:38,573
No response from 113th Ginujaya Squad!

1072
01:04:38,598 --> 01:04:41,424
An uprising, or are the Black Knights to blame?

1073
01:04:41,449 --> 01:04:44,825
Probably. I'll defend the temple's rear gate, sister.

1074
01:04:44,889 --> 01:04:46,180
Please be careful.

1075
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:48,439
We don't yet know whom it is we're fighting.

1076
01:04:48,526 --> 01:04:49,430
It's all right.

1077
01:04:49,689 --> 01:04:51,323
Once I'm piloting the Knightmare,

1078
01:04:51,348 --> 01:04:53,369
I can move just as freely as I like.

1079
01:04:54,846 --> 01:04:57,330
Forgnar, defend the seaward side.

1080
01:04:57,411 --> 01:04:58,696
Your Majesty.

1081
01:04:58,931 --> 01:05:03,139
Highness, forgive me, but might
we not be walking into a trap?

1082
01:05:03,267 --> 01:05:05,809
The King's general must do as he instructs.

1083
01:05:06,943 --> 01:05:08,693
Namjala latak.

1084
01:05:08,817 --> 01:05:12,272
I will defend the temple with every ounce of my strength.

1085
01:05:20,078 --> 01:05:20,985
Jeremiah,

1086
01:05:21,089 --> 01:05:24,771
in five minutes, you and your men will move
into the gulf district and divide their ranks.

1087
01:05:24,796 --> 01:05:25,820
Understood.

1088
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:44,373
Mr. Qujappat?

1089
01:05:44,417 --> 01:05:48,205
Princess Shamna wishes me to join the city guard. I obey.

1090
01:05:52,158 --> 01:05:53,035
Attention.

1091
01:05:53,136 --> 01:05:55,966
A national state of emergency has been declared.

1092
01:05:56,032 --> 01:05:58,695
Corresponding protocols are now in effect.

1093
01:05:58,728 --> 01:06:01,961
All soldiers are hereby ordered to
devote their efforts toward securing...

1094
01:06:01,986 --> 01:06:03,252
I for the people.

1095
01:06:04,008 --> 01:06:05,395
The people for me.

1096
01:06:05,766 --> 01:06:06,644
King Shalio.

1097
01:06:06,889 --> 01:06:09,825
The advance force on the
Gimsura Plains has been wiped out.

1098
01:06:09,850 --> 01:06:11,004
That fools.

1099
01:06:27,545 --> 01:06:29,128
That was your warning.

1100
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:31,703
You've seen what happens if you don't back down.

1101
01:06:47,486 --> 01:06:50,265
Nice. Looks like you've got the hang of it, Suzaku.

1102
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:52,282
The Suzaku you knew is dead.

1103
01:06:52,397 --> 01:06:53,564
From this point on...

1104
01:06:53,589 --> 01:06:56,082
Zero's not a symbolâ he's flesh and blood.

1105
01:06:56,107 --> 01:06:58,778
At least to me, so don't go there.

1106
01:07:02,578 --> 01:07:04,909
Otherwise we got a problem.

1107
01:07:15,139 --> 01:07:18,413
In 60 seconds, power to Category
Three and Category Four facilities

1108
01:07:18,438 --> 01:07:20,183
will be cut to stabilize the grid.

1109
01:07:20,317 --> 01:07:23,428
Ha! The Ministry couldn't have
been easier to bring to its knees!

1110
01:07:23,453 --> 01:07:26,432
Wow! The power of Geass is truly something to behold!

1111
01:07:26,457 --> 01:07:27,733
Your report, please.

1112
01:07:27,758 --> 01:07:29,860
Of course! Nina, if you would!

1113
01:07:29,885 --> 01:07:31,184
Finalizing! One moment!

1114
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:34,334
Nothing in the air or along the
ground particularly stands out.

1115
01:07:34,709 --> 01:07:36,542
Anya has the seaways covered.

1116
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:38,155
I've got something here!

1117
01:07:38,181 --> 01:07:40,592
Backup power has been rerouted to the temple!

1118
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:41,532
Has it?

1119
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,460
They must think they're clever.

1120
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:44,717
Right.

1121
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:48,795
We proceed to the sanctum sanctorum and
take the king's beloved sister hostage.

1122
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:55,799
C.C., you handle any Geass users.

1123
01:07:55,917 --> 01:07:56,743
Roger that.

1124
01:07:56,768 --> 01:07:59,529
My Lady, it's far too dangerous to remain here! Come...

1125
01:07:59,554 --> 01:08:00,296
Silence!

1126
01:08:00,362 --> 01:08:03,589
We will stand firm and complete the system. Is that clear?

1127
01:08:14,116 --> 01:08:16,304
If the name Zero carries any weight with you,

1128
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:17,739
surrender at once.

1129
01:08:18,161 --> 01:08:21,495
Fascinating. Shalio believed you were dead.

1130
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:25,621
Are you the real Suzaku Kururugi, or
merely someone content to wear his name?

1131
01:08:25,646 --> 01:08:27,854
I'm inclined to think there are dozens of you.

1132
01:08:27,884 --> 01:08:30,342
I am not here to engage in conversation.

1133
01:08:30,393 --> 01:08:32,191
My business is with Nunnally.

1134
01:08:32,969 --> 01:08:34,573
Surrender now and you'll live.

1135
01:08:34,848 --> 01:08:37,749
Hold fast and your country will burn to ash.

1136
01:08:38,189 --> 01:08:39,675
Oh, will it now?

1137
01:08:40,175 --> 01:08:41,759
I will not be your pawn.

1138
01:08:41,887 --> 01:08:44,029
You don't wish to spare your people?

1139
01:08:44,369 --> 01:08:46,507
I say again, surrender!

1140
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:47,731
Careful, Lelouch.

1141
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:49,890
She almost certainly possesses a Geass.

1142
01:08:49,915 --> 01:08:50,997
I can feel it.

1143
01:08:51,031 --> 01:08:51,998
I see.

1144
01:08:52,023 --> 01:08:54,445
And to think six hours ago...

1145
01:08:54,557 --> 01:08:57,445
I was enjoying a luxurious bath.

1146
01:08:58,503 --> 01:08:59,541
Damn you!

1147
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:05,523
Cunning as you may be,

1148
01:09:05,928 --> 01:09:09,677
this nation's warriors would never lose in a fair fight.

1149
01:09:11,753 --> 01:09:14,339
You've not seen the last of me.

1150
01:09:28,353 --> 01:09:30,863
Yet again, my life is reset,

1151
01:09:30,902 --> 01:09:33,096
pushed back by six hours.

1152
01:09:33,303 --> 01:09:34,983
What? Something troubles you.

1153
01:09:35,008 --> 01:09:36,065
Not at all.

1154
01:09:36,742 --> 01:09:38,241
Connect me to Forgnar.

1155
01:09:38,347 --> 01:09:40,305
Ah, another prophecy?

1156
01:09:40,372 --> 01:09:41,199
Yes.

1157
01:09:42,564 --> 01:09:44,555
What is your bidding, Highness?

1158
01:09:45,337 --> 01:09:46,412
Listen to me.

1159
01:09:46,556 --> 01:09:48,347
In six hours time...

1160
01:09:48,412 --> 01:09:51,003
rather, just before that, there will be an attack.

1161
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,320
An attack?

1162
01:09:52,518 --> 01:09:54,433
The Black Knights will be involved

1163
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:57,007
so it behooves us to expect subterfuge.

1164
01:09:57,572 --> 01:09:59,359
Further details are forthcoming.

1165
01:09:59,548 --> 01:10:01,259
For now, raise the alert level.

1166
01:10:01,508 --> 01:10:05,354
Namjala latak. Your gift is our guide, Highness.

1167
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:10,760
Zero, I vow that even with the master on your side,

1168
01:10:10,785 --> 01:10:12,414
you shall not defeat me.

1169
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:16,383
For when I die, I am destined to relive the past.

1170
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:19,462
Whatever move you make, I will foresee.

1171
01:10:20,156 --> 01:10:22,667
Zilkhstan will rise like a phoenix.

1172
01:10:23,392 --> 01:10:24,397
My sister.

1173
01:10:24,469 --> 01:10:25,774
I am here, Shalio.

1174
01:10:26,543 --> 01:10:28,900
How I long to be of use to this nation.

1175
01:10:28,951 --> 01:10:32,450
And yet, I am cursed to stand
aside while you fight to protect it.

1176
01:10:32,957 --> 01:10:35,813
But you're indispensible. Don't worry about me.

1177
01:10:35,997 --> 01:10:38,080
No. I have to worry.

1178
01:10:38,208 --> 01:10:41,918
The world is broken, but with the power of prophecy,

1179
01:10:41,947 --> 01:10:43,813
things will be as they should.

1180
01:10:55,316 --> 01:10:58,457
The enemy's forces in Majbeq
Station Two have been eliminated.

1181
01:10:58,715 --> 01:11:01,900
Dissidents at Radar Site Three are confirmed neutralized.

1182
01:11:02,472 --> 01:11:05,055
As always, my sister is exactly right,

1183
01:11:05,128 --> 01:11:07,943
and yet, I wonder if Zero will dare to emerge.

1184
01:11:07,968 --> 01:11:11,213
Your Highness, should we declare a state of emergency?

1185
01:11:11,238 --> 01:11:11,846
Hm?

1186
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:13,886
The insurgents will no doubt be bolder

1187
01:11:13,911 --> 01:11:15,578
if they believe themselves to be winning.

1188
01:11:15,603 --> 01:11:17,435
Ah, so draw them out in the open.

1189
01:11:17,529 --> 01:11:18,571
Exactly.

1190
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:19,604
Attention.

1191
01:11:19,631 --> 01:11:21,589
An emergency alert has been issued.

1192
01:11:21,761 --> 01:11:23,834
Citizens are advised to remain indoors.

1193
01:11:23,859 --> 01:11:26,344
Repeat. An emergency alert has been issued...

1194
01:11:27,882 --> 01:11:28,707
What?

1195
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:37,306
This can't be! Our lord's plan was...

1196
01:11:37,365 --> 01:11:38,532
They saw us coming!

1197
01:11:38,557 --> 01:11:39,461
No kidding!

1198
01:11:39,486 --> 01:11:41,683
They're waiting in ambush all over the place!

1199
01:11:41,961 --> 01:11:44,255
Zero, what the hell are we supposed to do?

1200
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:47,607
This was a suicide mission from the word go!

1201
01:11:48,441 --> 01:11:50,151
This match is lost, but how?

1202
01:11:50,176 --> 01:11:50,990
Bad news!

1203
01:11:51,064 --> 01:11:53,334
The area around the temple is under heightened security!

1204
01:11:53,359 --> 01:11:55,139
Um, Your Excellency...

1205
01:11:55,164 --> 01:11:55,870
What?

1206
01:11:56,317 --> 01:11:56,924
Well...

1207
01:11:56,949 --> 01:11:59,124
This facility's been put on lockdown.

1208
01:11:59,439 --> 01:12:00,301
Damn it!

1209
01:12:00,459 --> 01:12:02,296
They've seen through the entire plan!

1210
01:12:02,611 --> 01:12:05,301
Their tacticians are formidable, but this?

1211
01:12:06,939 --> 01:12:07,655
No!

1212
01:12:07,808 --> 01:12:09,867
My diversionary team is vulnerable!

1213
01:12:14,985 --> 01:12:17,930
Oh, man. I should've brought
something to help pass the time.

1214
01:12:23,644 --> 01:12:25,648
Well, whaddya know! They're here!

1215
01:12:25,707 --> 01:12:27,940
If you idiots are tired of sittin' around,

1216
01:12:27,965 --> 01:12:31,590
dust yourselves off and have a go at my Batalalan Du!

1217
01:12:39,459 --> 01:12:42,718
Kallen! Get some distance! I'll use my PNC...

1218
01:12:48,021 --> 01:12:49,047
It's him again!

1219
01:12:49,072 --> 01:12:51,578
When dealing with a long-range Knight Gigafortress,

1220
01:12:51,603 --> 01:12:54,228
it's simply a matter of getting close. However...

1221
01:12:54,342 --> 01:12:55,711
in this case...

1222
01:12:59,929 --> 01:13:01,119
You little bastard!

1223
01:13:01,144 --> 01:13:03,129
Heh, heh. I've got you.

1224
01:13:03,158 --> 01:13:04,974
Megistos Omega!

1225
01:13:13,065 --> 01:13:15,941
Damn it! The weight of this thing is working against me!

1226
01:13:16,865 --> 01:13:19,274
No! Come in, Suzaku! Kallen!

1227
01:13:20,611 --> 01:13:22,921
Oh, could this be ECM?

1228
01:13:23,873 --> 01:13:24,861
What do we do?

1229
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:26,842
We at least have to retrieve the data!

1230
01:13:26,867 --> 01:13:28,095
Let's just go.

1231
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:31,894
Wait, if Zero's plan has been anticipated
like this, then it stands to reason

1232
01:13:31,919 --> 01:13:33,974
fleeing by air would be an incredible risk.

1233
01:13:38,409 --> 01:13:40,327
Princess, I'm returning to Zero.

1234
01:13:41,932 --> 01:13:44,879
Good. Tell him our unit's en
route to storm the castle walls.

1235
01:13:44,915 --> 01:13:46,510
That ought to buy him some time.

1236
01:13:51,428 --> 01:13:52,392
Too late!

1237
01:13:54,988 --> 01:13:57,408
There's no way they could've known this was our next move!

1238
01:13:57,433 --> 01:14:01,017
Hello, is that the Witch of the Britannia I see before me?

1239
01:14:01,042 --> 01:14:02,643
Bovona Forgnar.

1240
01:14:02,834 --> 01:14:04,958
Great, the Brown Bulwark himself.

1241
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:07,094
Too slow.

1242
01:14:09,568 --> 01:14:11,641
Wait, Sayoko.

1243
01:14:11,666 --> 01:14:12,890
You've gotta slow down!

1244
01:14:12,941 --> 01:14:15,112
I can't keep up... My knee!

1245
01:14:15,724 --> 01:14:17,035
Wasn't sure you'd make it.

1246
01:14:18,455 --> 01:14:20,434
I can't seem to reach Master Zero.

1247
01:14:20,762 --> 01:14:23,465
The rest of you, follow the shoreline to the border.

1248
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:25,324
I'm afraid we can't have that.

1249
01:14:26,086 --> 01:14:29,463
Ya know, in this country,
terrorists are publicly crucified.

1250
01:14:29,488 --> 01:14:30,612
I feel for you...

1251
01:14:30,811 --> 01:14:33,540
not being able to tell your enemies from your allies.

1252
01:14:41,604 --> 01:14:42,438
Heh.

1253
01:14:45,089 --> 01:14:48,092
Wh... What? No! Miss Cecile!

1254
01:14:49,803 --> 01:14:51,053
I'm all right.

1255
01:14:51,092 --> 01:14:53,437
Just let me start the Knightmare.

1256
01:15:01,049 --> 01:15:03,126
This is spiraling out of control!

1257
01:15:07,186 --> 01:15:11,152
Reports say the terrorist command
unit has been successfully brought down.

1258
01:15:11,207 --> 01:15:12,074
Very good.

1259
01:15:21,622 --> 01:15:23,611
Am I too late? Oh, dear.

1260
01:15:23,767 --> 01:15:26,032
No. Perfect timing, Anya.

1261
01:15:26,057 --> 01:15:27,307
That's a relief.

1262
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:29,944
Jerry would be quite upset if anything happened.

1263
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:32,239
Hurry! Can you get the hatch open?

1264
01:15:32,285 --> 01:15:33,694
Climb out and switch to my unit!

1265
01:15:33,719 --> 01:15:35,363
I told you to stay at the border!

1266
01:15:35,511 --> 01:15:36,695
Why is the Gekkoei not...

1267
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:39,306
You may have noticed circumstances have changed.

1268
01:15:39,356 --> 01:15:43,509
Granted it's not quite finished, and it's
meant to be covert, so there are limits to what...

1269
01:15:50,561 --> 01:15:51,579
This is madness!

1270
01:15:51,707 --> 01:15:53,693
Who could've seen through my plan like this?

1271
01:15:54,206 --> 01:15:56,901
Should we gather intel or pull back?

1272
01:15:57,327 --> 01:16:00,762
If we retreat now it will leave
Suzaku, Kallen, and the others out to dry.

1273
01:16:00,787 --> 01:16:02,021
Don't you think I know that?!

1274
01:16:02,046 --> 01:16:03,651
If you want Nunnally back,

1275
01:16:03,773 --> 01:16:06,107
you have to come up with an alternate plan.

1276
01:16:12,212 --> 01:16:13,591
It has begun.

1277
01:16:14,158 --> 01:16:17,330
The system that should have ground to a halt is in motion.

1278
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:22,318
Nunnally, because of you, I
can once again enter C's World.

1279
01:16:22,464 --> 01:16:24,423
Now, where is it?

1280
01:16:24,595 --> 01:16:28,971
The source, the provenance, the origin of consciousness?

1281
01:16:29,152 --> 01:16:32,741
Please, make me the first human! Let us start afresh!

1282
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:38,339
Let me forge Zilkhstan into an empire! Shalio into a god!

1283
01:16:38,364 --> 01:16:43,183
Let me raise our people from the
dirt and reform the world in our image!

1284
01:16:44,828 --> 01:16:45,853
Princess Shamna?

1285
01:16:45,878 --> 01:16:47,346
You appear to have gone quite deep.

1286
01:16:47,868 --> 01:16:48,797
Are you all right?

1287
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:50,692
Here, allow me.

1288
01:16:51,272 --> 01:16:52,856
I'm so close.

1289
01:16:53,972 --> 01:16:55,594
Report on the terrorist incursion?

1290
01:16:55,619 --> 01:16:57,311
They have all been subdued, Highness.

1291
01:16:57,336 --> 01:16:58,804
The threat has now passed.

1292
01:16:58,829 --> 01:17:01,328
His Majesty and Forgnar repelled the intruders.

1293
01:17:01,353 --> 01:17:03,882
Good. Most welcome news.

1294
01:17:04,102 --> 01:17:08,231
Now a readjustment. I care not if Nunnally dies.

1295
01:17:08,272 --> 01:17:09,918
Namjala latak.

1296
01:17:14,094 --> 01:17:16,104
She's being kept in the temple.

1297
01:17:16,316 --> 01:17:17,239
But...

1298
01:17:17,754 --> 01:17:19,754
Lelouch, your orders, quickly.

1299
01:17:19,923 --> 01:17:22,244
I can't! Everything's in shambles!

1300
01:17:22,287 --> 01:17:23,055
What?

1301
01:17:23,888 --> 01:17:27,137
Even if I knew how to proceed, communication is down.

1302
01:17:27,263 --> 01:17:32,297
And knowing about my Geass doesn't explain how they
predicted every aspect of our attack before we made it!

1303
01:17:32,718 --> 01:17:34,649
We can't fight an opponent like this!

1304
01:17:41,253 --> 01:17:43,391
Tch. It's impossible to keep up!

1305
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:44,842
The needle marking...

1306
01:17:45,159 --> 01:17:46,680
Ugh! Both of them are out!

1307
01:17:46,705 --> 01:17:48,049
The people, yes.

1308
01:17:48,074 --> 01:17:50,229
I for them, and they for their leader.

1309
01:17:50,254 --> 01:17:53,599
Their king shall now triumph over Zero!

1310
01:17:58,884 --> 01:18:00,691
Here, you can take one of my arms!

1311
01:18:01,030 --> 01:18:02,730
But it'll cost you!

1312
01:18:02,755 --> 01:18:06,286
You fool! That move couldn't have been more transparent!

1313
01:18:07,346 --> 01:18:09,039
Zero, what do I do?

1314
01:18:09,064 --> 01:18:10,503
Zero, please!

1315
01:18:10,594 --> 01:18:13,252
I can't hold the line! Give us your orders!

1316
01:18:17,945 --> 01:18:21,808
It appears that our military
secrets have been leaked to your side.

1317
01:18:21,927 --> 01:18:23,491
This is the first I'm hearing of it.

1318
01:18:23,516 --> 01:18:26,458
I've also been given reports that
your country has had an uprising.

1319
01:18:26,483 --> 01:18:28,191
Just a military exercise.

1320
01:18:28,272 --> 01:18:30,064
Where, may I ask, is Shesthaal?

1321
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:32,268
We're told he's under the weather.

1322
01:18:32,618 --> 01:18:34,678
And what of the search for Nunnally and Zero?

1323
01:18:34,703 --> 01:18:36,490
It's beginning to feel as though our country

1324
01:18:36,515 --> 01:18:38,581
is being unfairly singled out in the that regard.

1325
01:18:38,707 --> 01:18:42,034
This would be one thing if we had a
treaty with the Federation of Nations,

1326
01:18:42,059 --> 01:18:46,177
but involving the Black Knights seems somewhat egregious.

1327
01:18:51,172 --> 01:18:53,506
I've been pinned down. At this rate I'll...

1328
01:18:53,531 --> 01:18:56,554
Somebody, please tell us what to do!

1329
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:00,477
C'mon! What are we waitin' for? Contact Zero!

1330
01:19:00,502 --> 01:19:02,133
Look, I don't know what you want me to tell you.

1331
01:19:02,158 --> 01:19:03,670
Our radios are jammed!

1332
01:19:07,294 --> 01:19:09,029
Ah, yes! There you are, my lord!

1333
01:19:09,072 --> 01:19:09,984
I was worried!

1334
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:16,885
I have news. A state of emergency was
declared in the vicinity of the capital,

1335
01:19:17,105 --> 01:19:19,798
but it appears to have been a
ploy to draw us into an ambush.

1336
01:19:19,901 --> 01:19:20,966
What's our next move?

1337
01:19:21,514 --> 01:19:22,354
Next?

1338
01:19:22,876 --> 01:19:24,987
We... We...

1339
01:19:25,547 --> 01:19:26,425
Surrender?

1340
01:19:29,058 --> 01:19:30,559
Under the circumstances...

1341
01:19:30,597 --> 01:19:32,644
Are things really that desperate?

1342
01:19:33,092 --> 01:19:34,031
Yes.

1343
01:19:36,018 --> 01:19:38,698
I've been here before, ready to quit.

1344
01:19:39,084 --> 01:19:40,120
Desperate.

1345
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:43,134
Hoping against hope for the tiniest speck of light.

1346
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:47,007
Even so, I never let myself give in.

1347
01:19:47,197 --> 01:19:50,831
I clung to the idea that somehow
I'd find a way to bring you back.

1348
01:19:50,997 --> 01:19:53,175
And now, here you are...

1349
01:19:53,545 --> 01:19:55,807
just not the "you" I wanted!

1350
01:19:56,776 --> 01:19:59,484
Where's your ego? Your arrogance?

1351
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:03,556
Where's the Lelouch who doesn't
know the meaning of give up?

1352
01:20:07,437 --> 01:20:08,531
I'm sorry.

1353
01:20:08,828 --> 01:20:11,984
I... I didn't... I shouldn't have said that.

1354
01:20:13,503 --> 01:20:16,381
If you want to quit, quit.

1355
01:20:16,406 --> 01:20:17,919
You selfish creature.

1356
01:20:19,584 --> 01:20:21,697
Let us consider the enemy's mind.

1357
01:20:22,331 --> 01:20:24,223
They, too, have a Geass, correct?

1358
01:20:24,248 --> 01:20:26,473
Wait, are you... are you sure?

1359
01:20:26,612 --> 01:20:27,491
Reasonably.

1360
01:20:27,594 --> 01:20:31,181
Given that hypothesis, let us narrow down what it does.

1361
01:20:31,825 --> 01:20:34,991
If we're wrong, we're no worse off than where we started.

1362
01:20:36,548 --> 01:20:37,631
Oh, and also...

1363
01:20:37,682 --> 01:20:38,296
Uh?

1364
01:20:38,384 --> 01:20:40,578
...Nunnally's rescue is non-negotiable.

1365
01:20:40,717 --> 01:20:42,495
We will get her out of there.

1366
01:20:49,784 --> 01:20:51,603
I've got you now!

1367
01:20:52,696 --> 01:20:53,598
Nice!

1368
01:20:53,811 --> 01:20:56,545
But, uh, how do we use this to contact Zero?

1369
01:20:56,570 --> 01:20:59,739
Heh! Easy, just stand back and let me work.

1370
01:21:02,147 --> 01:21:03,606
Choose one and look it over,

1371
01:21:03,634 --> 01:21:04,813
whichever you like.

1372
01:21:04,989 --> 01:21:06,406
That will be our plan.

1373
01:21:06,512 --> 01:21:07,716
I get it now.

1374
01:21:07,741 --> 01:21:10,498
The point is for me to be the
only one who knows the details.

1375
01:21:10,523 --> 01:21:13,644
Right. Geass doesn't work on you, after all.

1376
01:21:14,242 --> 01:21:16,574
So, now, the question is how we
organize the others accordingly.

1377
01:21:16,599 --> 01:21:18,514
Zero! Zero!

1378
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:21,541
What is that? It's across all frequencies.

1379
01:21:22,053 --> 01:21:23,759
Zero! It's Tamaki!

1380
01:21:23,784 --> 01:21:25,780
We took over an enemy Knightmare!

1381
01:21:26,675 --> 01:21:27,717
You idiot!

1382
01:21:27,742 --> 01:21:29,499
You're blabbing it on every channel!

1383
01:21:29,524 --> 01:21:31,043
You got a better idea?

1384
01:21:31,068 --> 01:21:33,568
I just didn't realize a living person could be so stupid!

1385
01:21:33,593 --> 01:21:35,075
Gentlemen, well done.

1386
01:21:35,681 --> 01:21:37,814
Yes. Excellent. Excellent!

1387
01:21:37,919 --> 01:21:39,794
C.C., hack into everything you can!

1388
01:21:39,819 --> 01:21:40,662
My pleasure.

1389
01:21:47,189 --> 01:21:49,552
Shamna, I've done it at last!

1390
01:21:49,626 --> 01:21:52,095
I've become strong enough to protect you!

1391
01:21:56,666 --> 01:21:58,185
Your attention, please!

1392
01:21:59,127 --> 01:22:00,665
My name is Zero.

1393
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:03,461
We are now entering the last phase of our mission.

1394
01:22:03,486 --> 01:22:05,534
Wait, another Zero?

1395
01:22:05,858 --> 01:22:07,427
This can only mean...

1396
01:22:07,709 --> 01:22:09,125
How intirguing!

1397
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:11,786
Why is he broadcasting on their channels?

1398
01:22:11,825 --> 01:22:14,454
What's he talking about, final phase?

1399
01:22:15,715 --> 01:22:18,390
I repeat: my name is Zero.

1400
01:22:18,503 --> 01:22:20,541
Those of you who still stand with me,

1401
01:22:20,767 --> 01:22:23,713
we are now entering the final phase of our mission.

1402
01:22:24,089 --> 01:22:25,230
We're doomed,

1403
01:22:25,255 --> 01:22:27,959
so I guess it doesn't matter if
the transmission's intercepted.

1404
01:22:28,295 --> 01:22:30,032
Yes, but what does he mean?

1405
01:22:30,166 --> 01:22:33,855
I don't recall our discussing a strategy
for this particular turn of events.

1406
01:22:34,167 --> 01:22:35,100
My lord?

1407
01:22:35,459 --> 01:22:37,481
Do you wish us to strike back?

1408
01:22:37,593 --> 01:22:40,122
So, this final phase, what did you have in mind?

1409
01:22:40,147 --> 01:22:41,255
Empty words,

1410
01:22:41,384 --> 01:22:43,890
though I doubt the enemy will interpret them as such.

1411
01:22:45,152 --> 01:22:46,883
There's the Zero I know.

1412
01:22:47,082 --> 01:22:48,186
Attack pattern?

1413
01:22:48,245 --> 01:22:49,410
Already chosen.

1414
01:22:49,566 --> 01:22:53,176
But, um, won't our allies be just as baffled as the enemy?

1415
01:22:53,201 --> 01:22:54,027
What will they do?

1416
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:55,089
Not a problem.

1417
01:22:55,336 --> 01:22:57,788
All that's left is to narrow down the variables.

1418
01:22:57,813 --> 01:22:59,040
Damn you, Zero.

1419
01:22:59,170 --> 01:23:01,811
What the devil are you playing at, announcing yourself?

1420
01:23:02,064 --> 01:23:05,686
Inform all forces that the perimeter has taken priority.

1421
01:23:05,909 --> 01:23:08,680
Nonsense. Why is now the first I'm hearing of this?

1422
01:23:08,705 --> 01:23:10,208
Shouldn't we all have been apprised?

1423
01:23:10,233 --> 01:23:11,412
It's a ruse.

1424
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:15,536
He's forcing the enemy to reconnoiter. It's brilliant.

1425
01:23:15,561 --> 01:23:17,519
Gives us a chance to regroup.

1426
01:23:18,432 --> 01:23:19,876
This is my brother.

1427
01:23:19,922 --> 01:23:22,898
Surely you realize he's never known when to quit.

1428
01:23:25,517 --> 01:23:27,741
Their commander is slow to give in.

1429
01:23:37,795 --> 01:23:40,618
Princess Shamna, Forgnar sends an urgent message.

1430
01:23:40,643 --> 01:23:43,193
He requests that you evacuate to Udunmu Base.

1431
01:23:43,237 --> 01:23:45,266
He really expects me to run now?

1432
01:23:45,291 --> 01:23:47,799
We don't yet know how many terrorists there are, Highness,

1433
01:23:47,824 --> 01:23:50,243
and the announcement moments ago was concerning.

1434
01:23:50,348 --> 01:23:51,849
Could it be the Fifth Fleet?

1435
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:55,195
My Lady, if Chief of Staff Schneizel is entering the fray,

1436
01:23:55,220 --> 01:23:57,756
we can be sure the entire Federation is committed.

1437
01:24:01,074 --> 01:24:04,080
Hm. I don't like this.

1438
01:24:04,174 --> 01:24:06,181
Why is Shesthaal so quiet?

1439
01:24:07,103 --> 01:24:10,421
All right, C.C., from here on out, command is yours.

1440
01:24:10,446 --> 01:24:11,427
Understood.

1441
01:24:11,522 --> 01:24:13,100
Although, I should point out,

1442
01:24:13,125 --> 01:24:14,907
you're the one who came up with this plan.

1443
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:17,308
CIC to Rook One. Execute as planned.

1444
01:24:17,333 --> 01:24:19,083
Focus on populated areas.

1445
01:24:19,108 --> 01:24:20,776
Rook One, copy.

1446
01:24:21,264 --> 01:24:23,191
Why would they be using our comms channels?

1447
01:24:23,249 --> 01:24:25,552
This is ridiculous! We can hear everything!

1448
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:27,425
What's going on?!

1449
01:24:27,450 --> 01:24:29,951
Princess Shamna, it's too dangerous here.

1450
01:24:30,024 --> 01:24:30,868
You must leave.

1451
01:24:30,893 --> 01:24:32,739
My work here is too important.

1452
01:24:32,764 --> 01:24:35,090
I will not let it claim your life, madam.

1453
01:24:35,493 --> 01:24:37,771
We must escort you to the castle where...

1454
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:41,197
I can prevent this.

1455
01:24:41,347 --> 01:24:43,965
Perhaps we intercept their aerial units first.

1456
01:24:48,876 --> 01:24:50,959
And what of the search for Nunnally and Zero?

1457
01:24:50,984 --> 01:24:54,797
It's beginning to feel as though our country
is being unfairly singled out in the that regard.

1458
01:24:54,908 --> 01:24:57,959
This would be one thing if we had a
treaty with the Federation of Nations,

1459
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:01,325
but involving the Black Knights seems somewhat egregious.

1460
01:25:02,428 --> 01:25:03,935
Rook One to CIC.

1461
01:25:04,262 --> 01:25:07,116
Enemy forces are deployed around the target area.

1462
01:25:07,368 --> 01:25:08,439
Please advise.

1463
01:25:08,796 --> 01:25:10,630
They know the infiltration routes?

1464
01:25:11,684 --> 01:25:12,532
In that case...

1465
01:25:12,557 --> 01:25:14,015
CIC to Rook One.

1466
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:16,929
Abort mission. Proceed to rendezvous point.

1467
01:25:16,954 --> 01:25:20,654
CIC to Bishop One. Carry out mission as instructed.

1468
01:25:20,911 --> 01:25:22,233
Copy that.

1469
01:25:24,395 --> 01:25:27,613
Behold my loyal heart!

1470
01:25:30,601 --> 01:25:32,982
Princess Shamna, don't worry, we'll protect you!

1471
01:25:33,007 --> 01:25:34,966
They've cut the substation's power.

1472
01:25:35,012 --> 01:25:37,462
We don't have time to wait for them to recharge.

1473
01:25:45,356 --> 01:25:46,156
What?

1474
01:25:46,822 --> 01:25:49,322
Bishop One to CIC. They were lying in wait.

1475
01:25:49,347 --> 01:25:50,586
I'm falling back.

1476
01:25:50,659 --> 01:25:51,812
So much for that.

1477
01:25:52,028 --> 01:25:54,291
Despite me not knowing the details.

1478
01:25:54,316 --> 01:25:56,585
Right, the only one who knew is me,

1479
01:25:56,769 --> 01:25:58,618
and I'm immune to Geass.

1480
01:25:58,878 --> 01:25:59,913
Precisely.

1481
01:26:00,113 --> 01:26:03,370
Which tells us that their Geass
doesn't allow them to read minds.

1482
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:06,102
And also, that they're in a position of power.

1483
01:26:06,127 --> 01:26:08,252
They can mobilize the military at will.

1484
01:26:08,277 --> 01:26:09,672
This narrows it down.

1485
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:11,825
Do you think it's King Shalio?

1486
01:26:11,967 --> 01:26:14,400
No. He's too fixated on Suzaku.

1487
01:26:14,629 --> 01:26:17,926
The likelier culprit is Forgnar or Princess Shamna.

1488
01:26:18,193 --> 01:26:21,847
I suggest we engage Aegis mode
and proceed to the next plan.

1489
01:26:24,077 --> 01:26:24,766
Right.

1490
01:26:25,637 --> 01:26:26,952
Something's off.

1491
01:26:27,158 --> 01:26:28,784
They have Nunnally in their grasp,

1492
01:26:28,837 --> 01:26:31,733
but haven't made use of her intelligence. Why?

1493
01:26:32,042 --> 01:26:35,276
Is she herself the objective? Strange.

1494
01:26:35,371 --> 01:26:38,161
It's as if they don't care
whether the kingdom is jeopardized.

1495
01:26:38,415 --> 01:26:41,248
No. That doesn't make sense.

1496
01:26:42,678 --> 01:26:43,471
Wait.

1497
01:26:44,367 --> 01:26:46,477
Well, there goes another one.

1498
01:26:47,458 --> 01:26:49,543
They saw the gas attack coming, too.

1499
01:26:49,602 --> 01:26:50,978
Covered the vents to prevent it.

1500
01:26:51,003 --> 01:26:51,913
So what now?

1501
01:26:53,545 --> 01:26:55,010
Looks like a rush job.

1502
01:26:58,493 --> 01:27:01,904
ETA on the Black Knights'
arrival is approximately four hours.

1503
01:27:02,047 --> 01:27:05,896
Okay, do we order Suzaku and the others to
fall back until the main forces get here...

1504
01:27:05,921 --> 01:27:06,338
No.

1505
01:27:06,932 --> 01:27:10,137
Hold firm. If we fall back now,
they'll shore up their defenses.

1506
01:27:11,345 --> 01:27:14,129
Can you find out how long ago
the vent covers were put in place?

1507
01:27:14,208 --> 01:27:14,942
Of course.

1508
01:27:19,722 --> 01:27:23,691
Okay. I narrowed their Geass down to 22 possibilities.

1509
01:27:23,774 --> 01:27:25,065
I have to be careful.

1510
01:27:25,258 --> 01:27:27,485
Can't exhaust our moves trying to figure it out.

1511
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:30,146
Seventeen perhaps, sixteen.

1512
01:27:30,297 --> 01:27:32,099
Twelve... No, that's not it.

1513
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:35,505
Eight. Good, that eliminates Forgnar.

1514
01:27:35,806 --> 01:27:37,139
Can we still hold out?

1515
01:27:37,615 --> 01:27:40,573
Three, not the advisors. That leaves Shamna.

1516
01:27:40,789 --> 01:27:41,761
Yet...

1517
01:27:42,314 --> 01:27:44,213
Two. No good.

1518
01:27:44,338 --> 01:27:47,639
I'm out of moves with nothing
conclusive enough to protect Nunnally.

1519
01:27:48,917 --> 01:27:50,659
It comes down to a coin toss.

1520
01:27:50,684 --> 01:27:52,374
This is unacceptable!

1521
01:28:00,637 --> 01:28:02,803
At last, my wish has...

1522
01:28:19,008 --> 01:28:21,545
How unfortunate. You've died again I see.

1523
01:28:25,858 --> 01:28:28,650
Nonetheless, if I connect once more...

1524
01:28:28,709 --> 01:28:29,647
You won't.

1525
01:28:31,532 --> 01:28:34,370
You're trying to gain access to C's World, aren't you?

1526
01:28:34,395 --> 01:28:35,496
That face...

1527
01:28:36,865 --> 01:28:39,422
You're the detested Emperor Lelouch!

1528
01:28:40,425 --> 01:28:41,127
Huh.

1529
01:28:41,473 --> 01:28:43,512
I shouldn't really be surprised. Heh.

1530
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,585
Such an amusing thing, fate.

1531
01:28:46,677 --> 01:28:51,329
To think I would be standing here across from
the very catalyst for what I'm attempting to do.

1532
01:28:51,705 --> 01:28:56,132
Is it true what I hear about the Black Knights
making landfall within the next four hours?

1533
01:28:56,237 --> 01:28:57,072
Yes.

1534
01:28:57,336 --> 01:28:57,849
Huh...

1535
01:28:58,701 --> 01:29:01,169
Shamna, would you like to know why

1536
01:29:01,194 --> 01:29:02,739
I nearly conquered the world?

1537
01:29:03,584 --> 01:29:04,475
No.

1538
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:05,856
You must have an inkling,

1539
01:29:05,881 --> 01:29:08,813
considering we possess the exact same Geass.

1540
01:29:09,728 --> 01:29:11,477
Imagine my surprise.

1541
01:29:11,706 --> 01:29:14,413
I'd always assumed the power was unique to me.

1542
01:29:15,406 --> 01:29:17,327
Incidentally, this may take a while.

1543
01:29:17,542 --> 01:29:19,376
Would you mind preparing some tea?

1544
01:29:20,031 --> 01:29:21,216
Not interested?

1545
01:29:22,281 --> 01:29:23,435
Fair enough.

1546
01:29:23,659 --> 01:29:25,108
But you couldn't possibly...

1547
01:29:25,381 --> 01:29:26,403
The same?

1548
01:29:27,075 --> 01:29:28,248
He's bluffing.

1549
01:29:28,273 --> 01:29:30,897
There are any number of ways he could've figured it out.

1550
01:29:31,303 --> 01:29:35,840
And yet, the fact remains that for
all intents and purposes, I'm cornered.

1551
01:29:36,033 --> 01:29:38,783
Is this the first time we've spoken, or just one of many?

1552
01:29:39,310 --> 01:29:40,362
I can't...

1553
01:29:41,306 --> 01:29:45,570
Don't be coy, use your Geass against me while time allows.

1554
01:29:46,067 --> 01:29:47,984
Check. It's your move.

1555
01:29:48,009 --> 01:29:49,254
Insolent fool.

1556
01:29:49,598 --> 01:29:52,598
If you're so confident, show me your power first!

1557
01:29:54,771 --> 01:29:57,530
Don't kill him! I order this man be kept alive!

1558
01:29:57,750 --> 01:30:00,780
Excellent! All the other variables are eliminated!

1559
01:30:06,533 --> 01:30:09,150
What trickery is this? You coward!

1560
01:30:09,238 --> 01:30:10,925
We don't possess the same Geass at all!

1561
01:30:10,950 --> 01:30:13,264
I knew it! A spineless move!

1562
01:30:14,041 --> 01:30:17,523
I had to be sure what yours was before I could use mine.

1563
01:30:17,581 --> 01:30:19,398
So that's your Geass.

1564
01:30:19,423 --> 01:30:21,320
Your death sends you back in time.

1565
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:25,201
And you're using Nunnally to
expand the bounderies of its power.

1566
01:30:25,459 --> 01:30:26,787
Tell me, Lelouch,

1567
01:30:27,595 --> 01:30:30,303
is there nothing in your own past you would change?

1568
01:30:30,397 --> 01:30:34,241
Imagine what you could alter with
an infinite number of new beginnings!

1569
01:30:34,647 --> 01:30:36,493
You could restore your legacy.

1570
01:30:36,681 --> 01:30:40,222
You could shed the venomous
name foisted upon you and join me!

1571
01:30:40,247 --> 01:30:41,954
You would deny me my pain?

1572
01:30:43,193 --> 01:30:45,784
Why would I shed the greater part of who I am?

1573
01:30:45,906 --> 01:30:48,989
My past is the crucible in which I was forged.

1574
01:30:49,104 --> 01:30:50,793
My scars are a testament.

1575
01:30:51,117 --> 01:30:54,036
Undoubtedly, but don't you wish for a better future?

1576
01:30:54,061 --> 01:30:56,698
Of course I do, but it doesn't belong to me.

1577
01:30:57,161 --> 01:30:58,479
It belongs to everyone.

1578
01:30:58,504 --> 01:31:00,797
You and I would both do well to remember that.

1579
01:31:01,918 --> 01:31:03,496
Silence... Uh!

1580
01:31:04,589 --> 01:31:06,047
You are a fool.

1581
01:31:06,072 --> 01:31:08,882
I assure you, this path leads nowhere.

1582
01:31:09,187 --> 01:31:12,207
A ruler worthy of the title would turn from it.

1583
01:31:13,876 --> 01:31:15,222
What would you have me do?

1584
01:31:15,597 --> 01:31:18,616
My people were hopeless. Does such love deserve death?

1585
01:31:18,641 --> 01:31:21,664
I won't kill you, merely render you unconscious.

1586
01:31:21,689 --> 01:31:22,782
You will sleep now.

1587
01:31:22,807 --> 01:31:23,994
No! Please!

1588
01:31:36,271 --> 01:31:38,031
Sure we should leave her like this?

1589
01:31:38,136 --> 01:31:40,387
The vents were covered nine hours ago,

1590
01:31:40,434 --> 01:31:42,999
meaning she can go back only as far as that.

1591
01:31:43,489 --> 01:31:46,583
Ergo, we'll destroy this place ten hours from now.

1592
01:31:46,992 --> 01:31:49,921
When her Geass triggers and she travels back,

1593
01:31:50,408 --> 01:31:52,700
she'll find herself unconscious.

1594
01:31:55,417 --> 01:31:56,876
Why has nothing been said?

1595
01:31:56,958 --> 01:31:59,934
What did you see sister? What will they do?

1596
01:31:59,959 --> 01:32:01,129
Your Majesty!

1597
01:32:01,154 --> 01:32:03,546
Communications with the temple have been severed!

1598
01:32:04,169 --> 01:32:07,076
You're breaking up. I can't understand you!

1599
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:09,185
Hello? Can you read me?

1600
01:32:09,447 --> 01:32:10,633
Zero speaking.

1601
01:32:11,629 --> 01:32:13,273
The mission was a success.

1602
01:32:13,626 --> 01:32:15,734
Nunnally has been retrieved!

1603
01:32:15,958 --> 01:32:17,626
That's patently false.

1604
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:18,944
Mission accomplished.

1605
01:32:19,094 --> 01:32:20,803
Allies withdraw.

1606
01:32:20,854 --> 01:32:24,770
Repeat: Allies withdraw. Abandon your Knightmares.

1607
01:32:24,876 --> 01:32:26,876
Rendezvous and regroup accordingly.

1608
01:32:27,190 --> 01:32:28,459
Well done, everyone.

1609
01:32:28,671 --> 01:32:31,087
This is my final transmission.

1610
01:32:31,203 --> 01:32:33,405
Thank you. It's been an honor.

1611
01:32:33,825 --> 01:32:36,208
Um, okay. Attitude control holding.

1612
01:32:36,233 --> 01:32:38,041
How is she doing? The bleeding stopped?

1613
01:32:38,066 --> 01:32:40,888
Luckily, yes. She'll need a few transfusions, though.

1614
01:32:40,962 --> 01:32:42,962
Blaze luminous, I believe it was called?

1615
01:32:42,987 --> 01:32:44,488
The moment you run out of energy,

1616
01:32:44,513 --> 01:32:46,129
you'll be completely helpless!

1617
01:32:46,154 --> 01:32:49,269
Damn you, Zero. Face me, you coward.

1618
01:32:49,773 --> 01:32:50,568
Move out!

1619
01:32:50,593 --> 01:32:53,165
Apprehend the terrorists as they attempt to fleeâ

1620
01:32:53,190 --> 01:32:54,399
dead or alive.

1621
01:32:54,424 --> 01:32:56,311
This battle's not over yet!

1622
01:32:57,275 --> 01:32:59,861
Guilford, I'm taking the castle...

1623
01:33:00,013 --> 01:33:01,601
even if I have to do it alone.

1624
01:33:01,626 --> 01:33:02,626
Wait, no!

1625
01:33:02,651 --> 01:33:03,706
It's personal now.

1626
01:33:03,731 --> 01:33:06,303
If I can't beat them, I'll at least put them off balance.

1627
01:33:06,328 --> 01:33:08,021
You are not going in there alone.

1628
01:33:09,051 --> 01:33:10,402
Suit yourself.

1629
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,145
Let's go.

1630
01:33:13,991 --> 01:33:14,784
Your Majesty...

1631
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:16,281
What's going on?

1632
01:33:17,065 --> 01:33:19,373
That does it. I'm going back.

1633
01:33:26,470 --> 01:33:29,399
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

1634
01:33:29,631 --> 01:33:31,661
I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1635
01:33:32,081 --> 01:33:35,395
There! What more do you want from me, damn it?

1636
01:33:36,189 --> 01:33:37,753
Huh? What the...

1637
01:33:43,598 --> 01:33:45,071
No offense, Shanti.

1638
01:33:45,571 --> 01:33:48,149
Your Frame Coat's not meant for a brawl.

1639
01:33:49,740 --> 01:33:52,323
Being lighter may have its advantages, sure,

1640
01:33:52,414 --> 01:33:55,093
but your armor is also easily shattered!

1641
01:34:01,525 --> 01:34:02,650
You're joking.

1642
01:34:02,675 --> 01:34:04,870
It's been hiding an anti-Knightmare mode?

1643
01:34:17,170 --> 01:34:18,524
I can do this.

1644
01:34:39,951 --> 01:34:41,646
Hey, Nunnally.

1645
01:34:41,671 --> 01:34:44,730
Do you suppose her mind is stuck in C's world?

1646
01:34:45,492 --> 01:34:47,959
But the gateway beneath the prison has been destroyed.

1647
01:34:50,156 --> 01:34:51,595
We have no choice then.

1648
01:34:51,826 --> 01:34:53,891
We have to use the one Shamna built.

1649
01:35:04,709 --> 01:35:07,732
Where're you kids running off to? The fun's just starting!

1650
01:35:07,909 --> 01:35:11,627
I'm honestly impressed you made it
this far in that useless Knightmare,

1651
01:35:11,652 --> 01:35:13,969
and under the sway of my Geass no less.

1652
01:35:14,807 --> 01:35:17,363
Ha! Too bad it's all been for nothing!

1653
01:35:17,392 --> 01:35:18,392
Sorry...

1654
01:35:22,598 --> 01:35:24,708
You let the water conduct.

1655
01:35:25,492 --> 01:35:26,784
Well played...

1656
01:35:39,067 --> 01:35:40,651
Witch of Britannia,

1657
01:35:40,701 --> 01:35:43,207
I will surround you and crush you flat.

1658
01:35:43,294 --> 01:35:45,662
Leave Forgnar to me. He's mine.

1659
01:35:45,698 --> 01:35:46,824
Have at him.

1660
01:35:54,928 --> 01:35:56,233
How did she break through?

1661
01:35:56,258 --> 01:35:58,776
Forgnar! Show us what you're made of!

1662
01:35:58,801 --> 01:36:00,154
Give me your worst!

1663
01:36:12,745 --> 01:36:14,286
It's over, old man!

1664
01:36:14,339 --> 01:36:16,930
If you value your life, you'll stand down!

1665
01:36:17,073 --> 01:36:21,330
Attention all forces! Kill her! Blast both of us together!

1666
01:36:32,731 --> 01:36:34,921
I'm perfectly capable of doing this alone.

1667
01:36:35,047 --> 01:36:36,367
I couldn't let you do that.

1668
01:36:37,513 --> 01:36:38,953
She's over that way then.

1669
01:36:39,191 --> 01:36:39,793
Good luck.

1670
01:36:40,898 --> 01:36:41,736
What about you?

1671
01:36:42,272 --> 01:36:43,916
There's something I need to check.

1672
01:36:44,452 --> 01:36:45,638
I'll go back first.

1673
01:36:45,673 --> 01:36:48,541
Someone needs to make sure our bodies are in a safe place.

1674
01:36:59,504 --> 01:37:02,129
How long has it been since you left the Order?

1675
01:37:02,372 --> 01:37:04,683
I can't help but wonder what your story is.

1676
01:37:04,722 --> 01:37:06,975
I hope you'll forgive my impertinence.

1677
01:37:07,748 --> 01:37:10,373
Master C.C. An honor to meet you.

1678
01:37:10,478 --> 01:37:12,762
Didn't you see this coming?

1679
01:37:13,167 --> 01:37:14,785
No, not entirely.

1680
01:37:15,086 --> 01:37:17,451
My original Geass allowed me to look ahead,

1681
01:37:17,476 --> 01:37:19,726
but it changed into the power I have now.

1682
01:37:19,829 --> 01:37:22,110
Because your reasoning became corrupted.

1683
01:37:22,909 --> 01:37:25,951
I chose instead to embrace a lofty dream.

1684
01:37:26,178 --> 01:37:28,156
To reshape the world of men.

1685
01:37:29,497 --> 01:37:33,594
For the people of my nation,
economic power lies solely in fighting.

1686
01:37:34,144 --> 01:37:36,853
Lelouch's peace put our backs against the wall.

1687
01:37:36,958 --> 01:37:38,372
Ironic, isn't it?

1688
01:37:38,642 --> 01:37:41,537
Because of him, you're condemned to wander between

1689
01:37:41,562 --> 01:37:43,538
life and death for all eternity.

1690
01:37:44,197 --> 01:37:46,496
I can send you on if you so wish.

1691
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:49,515
I will stay.

1692
01:37:50,353 --> 01:37:53,841
In this realm I may again walk with those lost to me.

1693
01:37:55,078 --> 01:37:57,528
Shalio will be among them one day.

1694
01:37:58,420 --> 01:38:00,565
Shalio, dear brother.

1695
01:38:00,817 --> 01:38:02,997
How many times have you fought for me?

1696
01:38:03,230 --> 01:38:04,410
Died for me?

1697
01:38:07,289 --> 01:38:09,554
If that is your desire, I can do nothing.

1698
01:38:10,430 --> 01:38:12,007
May you have no regrets.

1699
01:38:18,506 --> 01:38:20,484
There we go! Clear shot!

1700
01:38:24,687 --> 01:38:27,155
Rashid! Zamzar! Jose!

1701
01:38:27,273 --> 01:38:27,970
Ugh.

1702
01:38:28,586 --> 01:38:32,390
Fine! Just means there's more money for
me when I bring this little birdie down!

1703
01:38:32,415 --> 01:38:34,163
My machine is second to none!

1704
01:38:34,188 --> 01:38:36,749
You don't know the meaning of
the word resilience, sweetheart!

1705
01:38:36,774 --> 01:38:40,388
Ha! I can take whatever you dish out and then some!

1706
01:38:46,540 --> 01:38:49,202
Wait. Suzaku's got a problem.

1707
01:38:50,469 --> 01:38:54,150
Shamna! I need your power. I need your prophecy!

1708
01:39:02,194 --> 01:39:04,155
I'm... alone. Then...

1709
01:39:04,451 --> 01:39:07,456
if she is gone, I will fight.

1710
01:39:08,195 --> 01:39:09,470
For the people!

1711
01:39:09,848 --> 01:39:12,675
Nagid Shu Mane, do not fail me.

1712
01:39:12,792 --> 01:39:15,712
Be my spirit. Be my body!

1713
01:39:31,044 --> 01:39:33,337
You sure you wanna play rough with me?

1714
01:39:33,362 --> 01:39:35,901
You'll end up wearing yourself out before long.

1715
01:39:35,926 --> 01:39:40,073
'Sides, you'll never break through my
armor if all you do is duck me like a coward!

1716
01:39:40,098 --> 01:39:43,425
Pretty good advice. How 'bout I fire at you headlong?

1717
01:39:45,353 --> 01:39:46,854
Idiot!

1718
01:39:46,925 --> 01:39:50,374
Maybe. You're tough. I'll definitely give you that.

1719
01:39:58,689 --> 01:40:01,397
The hell is this? What happened?

1720
01:40:01,459 --> 01:40:03,844
The prophecy was unbeatable!

1721
01:40:04,606 --> 01:40:09,856
But my machine! My money!

1722
01:40:14,511 --> 01:40:15,688
What is that?

1723
01:40:15,713 --> 01:40:18,287
I don't know, but I don't think it's good.

1724
01:40:25,470 --> 01:40:28,019
Listen to me. I will save you Nunnally!

1725
01:40:28,050 --> 01:40:29,692
No! Wait!

1726
01:40:29,865 --> 01:40:32,531
I won't let you sacrifice yourself for me!

1727
01:40:32,556 --> 01:40:34,760
There's something I have to tell you!

1728
01:40:39,969 --> 01:40:42,253
What gives? He's still asleep?

1729
01:40:42,475 --> 01:40:45,433
We'll give him as long as he needs. He's exhausted.

1730
01:40:45,717 --> 01:40:47,424
Please! We carried him here.

1731
01:40:47,449 --> 01:40:49,301
If anyone's exhausted, it's us.

1732
01:40:49,659 --> 01:40:52,602
Why are you taking so long? Come back!

1733
01:40:55,483 --> 01:40:58,093
The minds that comprise this realm, hear me!

1734
01:40:58,284 --> 01:41:00,586
I, Lelouch Lamperouge, command you!

1735
01:41:06,067 --> 01:41:07,366
Nunnally.

1736
01:41:07,931 --> 01:41:09,856
Yes? What is it?

1737
01:41:09,881 --> 01:41:11,723
My Geass is my sin to bear.

1738
01:41:12,381 --> 01:41:13,631
Mine alone.

1739
01:41:27,882 --> 01:41:28,973
Would you look at that.

1740
01:41:29,751 --> 01:41:31,797
Once again I owe my life to you.

1741
01:41:47,253 --> 01:41:49,865
Why? Why is this happening to me?

1742
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:52,483
Why?!

1743
01:42:06,494 --> 01:42:09,462
You shattered the peace. You abducted Nunnally.

1744
01:42:09,553 --> 01:42:11,130
Answer for your crimes!

1745
01:42:11,203 --> 01:42:12,719
What was I to do?

1746
01:42:12,744 --> 01:42:14,190
Don't you understand?

1747
01:42:14,215 --> 01:42:17,056
There's no place for my country in a world of peace!

1748
01:42:17,945 --> 01:42:20,028
Surrender. This fight is over.

1749
01:42:20,053 --> 01:42:23,829
No, it's not! In the name of my great sister's burden,

1750
01:42:23,854 --> 01:42:25,625
I defy you!

1751
01:42:25,650 --> 01:42:27,355
I am a warrior!

1752
01:42:27,380 --> 01:42:28,081
Wha...

1753
01:42:28,392 --> 01:42:30,536
There's no honor in dying!

1754
01:42:36,167 --> 01:42:38,068
How many have suffered for me?

1755
01:42:38,214 --> 01:42:41,416
How many have died to maintain my body?

1756
01:42:41,946 --> 01:42:47,059
If I lose now, it will have all been meaningless.

1757
01:42:47,522 --> 01:42:48,649
Shamna...

1758
01:42:49,718 --> 01:42:50,737
Sister...

1759
01:42:51,256 --> 01:42:54,374
Tell me... what should I have done?

1760
01:42:55,055 --> 01:42:57,340
That light... What is...

1761
01:43:14,083 --> 01:43:16,228
Ugh! Where is His Majesty?

1762
01:43:16,253 --> 01:43:18,090
Where is Princess Shamna?

1763
01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:20,634
Damn it, men! What are you waiting for?

1764
01:43:20,659 --> 01:43:24,915
I told you to fire! Forget about me! That's an order!

1765
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:25,538
Stop.

1766
01:43:26,775 --> 01:43:28,733
They're not going to let you die.

1767
01:43:28,784 --> 01:43:30,831
You're Generalissimo Forgnar,

1768
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,000
the only one standing between them and chaos.

1769
01:43:36,799 --> 01:43:38,048
It's over.

1770
01:43:38,189 --> 01:43:39,932
The prophecy was wrong.

1771
01:43:46,113 --> 01:43:49,208
Good news concerning Honorary Consultant Nunnally.

1772
01:43:49,233 --> 01:43:53,018
It seems the event many have called
the Puzzlement in Hashvess has ended well.

1773
01:43:53,103 --> 01:43:55,168
Early this morning, a rescue squadron

1774
01:43:55,193 --> 01:43:57,175
led by Lieutenant General Cornelia

1775
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:59,797
found the consultant alive and unharmed.

1776
01:43:59,978 --> 01:44:03,526
A nation known for its soldiers and its prophecies,

1777
01:44:03,601 --> 01:44:06,081
and yet even they couldn't defeat him.

1778
01:44:13,294 --> 01:44:15,159
Well, the cavalry's arrived.

1779
01:44:15,184 --> 01:44:17,136
Better late than never, I suppose.

1780
01:44:17,917 --> 01:44:20,564
Now we can get you some proper medical attention.

1781
01:44:20,607 --> 01:44:23,065
That's a relief. Thank you, Doctor.

1782
01:44:23,158 --> 01:44:25,184
Sorry if I made you miss out on anything.

1783
01:44:25,209 --> 01:44:26,187
Not to worry.

1784
01:44:26,212 --> 01:44:29,743
There are plenty other war-torn
regions for us to visit I'm sure.

1785
01:44:29,836 --> 01:44:33,419
Feels like congratulations are in order if you ask me.

1786
01:44:53,876 --> 01:44:56,260
Oh, thank goodness! You're back.

1787
01:44:56,326 --> 01:44:58,840
What is it? He finally awake?

1788
01:44:59,097 --> 01:45:00,183
Perfect timing.

1789
01:45:00,417 --> 01:45:01,933
You should come see this.

1790
01:45:02,134 --> 01:45:03,117
Huh?

1791
01:45:08,909 --> 01:45:10,367
This is breathtaking.

1792
01:45:10,417 --> 01:45:12,901
I see you made it back. Good for you.

1793
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:17,429
Huh?

1794
01:45:40,670 --> 01:45:43,169
Farewell, Suzaku. That's yours now.

1795
01:45:43,208 --> 01:45:44,611
What're you talking about?

1796
01:45:45,559 --> 01:45:47,439
We talked about this, remember?

1797
01:45:48,208 --> 01:45:49,159
I can't stay.

1798
01:45:49,184 --> 01:45:50,159
Lelouch.

1799
01:45:51,785 --> 01:45:53,604
Hm? Yeah?

1800
01:45:53,751 --> 01:45:57,237
I... I tried to tell you this before, but...

1801
01:45:57,758 --> 01:46:00,638
I had assumed the worst of you and it was wrong of me.

1802
01:46:00,742 --> 01:46:02,749
You deserved better and I'm sorry.

1803
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:04,542
Water under the bridge.

1804
01:46:04,792 --> 01:46:07,852
Please, you don't have to carry it alone.

1805
01:46:07,901 --> 01:46:09,693
I'm just as guilty as you!

1806
01:46:09,718 --> 01:46:13,630
It's not right for you to have to bear
the burden by yourself and it never was!

1807
01:46:13,655 --> 01:46:15,272
Let me share it with you!

1808
01:46:18,444 --> 01:46:20,400
That's very kind. Thank you.

1809
01:46:46,718 --> 01:46:47,994
You forgot this.

1810
01:46:48,239 --> 01:46:49,828
Oh. Thanks.

1811
01:46:50,223 --> 01:46:53,102
So what, you're just gonna sneak away?

1812
01:46:53,401 --> 01:46:56,161
I have my own road to follow, but I'll be around...

1813
01:46:56,259 --> 01:46:57,605
...from time to time.

1814
01:46:58,628 --> 01:46:59,568
Hmm.

1815
01:47:02,823 --> 01:47:05,263
Lot of folks leaving the country, I see.

1816
01:47:05,597 --> 01:47:08,802
Hey, we did the right thing, didn't we?

1817
01:47:09,024 --> 01:47:11,948
I dunno. That's for history to decide.

1818
01:47:13,392 --> 01:47:16,885
Sometimes, you have to go with
your gut and stumble through it.

1819
01:47:23,425 --> 01:47:25,693
C.C.! Where are you going?

1820
01:47:25,969 --> 01:47:26,742
Wait!

1821
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,057
Well, I guess some things never change, huh?

1822
01:47:34,082 --> 01:47:37,849
It's not that. You just... You left without telling me.

1823
01:47:37,874 --> 01:47:40,092
Yes? What of it? Did I forget something?

1824
01:47:40,179 --> 01:47:41,794
I'm coming with... you.

1825
01:47:42,227 --> 01:47:44,269
What? But Nunnally...

1826
01:47:44,338 --> 01:47:48,624
Will be just fine. She's a very capable young woman.

1827
01:47:48,817 --> 01:47:51,357
If I stay around, I'll just get in her way.

1828
01:47:56,069 --> 01:47:57,799
Y... You have other options.

1829
01:47:57,938 --> 01:48:01,305
You could drop in on Shirley, or Kaguya for that matter.

1830
01:48:01,363 --> 01:48:02,700
Eventually, sure,

1831
01:48:02,994 --> 01:48:04,642
but this doesn't feel like the right time.

1832
01:48:04,894 --> 01:48:06,604
I don't want to cause a scene.

1833
01:48:07,388 --> 01:48:10,746
If you're looking for someone to
be your servant, look somewhere else.

1834
01:48:10,928 --> 01:48:13,944
I'm tracking down the Geass fragments Shamna left behind.

1835
01:48:13,969 --> 01:48:16,017
I have no interest in being your sidekick.

1836
01:48:16,042 --> 01:48:17,417
Oh, I see how it is.

1837
01:48:17,442 --> 01:48:19,882
You bring me back to life and leave like it's nothing.

1838
01:48:20,373 --> 01:48:21,924
You're such a selfish creature!

1839
01:48:22,138 --> 01:48:23,305
Yes, I am!

1840
01:48:23,397 --> 01:48:25,558
We've established that already, remember?

1841
01:48:26,064 --> 01:48:26,845
Idiot.

1842
01:48:27,534 --> 01:48:29,546
You haven't even decided what to call yourself.

1843
01:48:29,665 --> 01:48:31,235
You can't stick with Lelouch.

1844
01:48:31,260 --> 01:48:32,105
I know that.

1845
01:48:32,130 --> 01:48:35,225
Still, I don't have to abandon my name altogether.

1846
01:48:35,250 --> 01:48:37,722
What if I went with L.L.?

1847
01:48:40,937 --> 01:48:42,036
Has a ring to it.

1848
01:52:19,475 --> 01:52:20,448
Really?

1849
01:52:20,939 --> 01:52:23,397
By having Geass, you're able to live.

1850
01:52:23,422 --> 01:52:27,500
And yet, the same power that allows
you to live in the world of men,

1851
01:52:27,615 --> 01:52:30,630
compels you to abide by a different set of rules.

1852
01:52:31,615 --> 01:52:36,657
Act by a new logic, move to its
rhythms, lead a different life.

1853
01:52:37,622 --> 01:52:40,909
Be warned, the king's power may isolate you.

1854
01:52:41,144 --> 01:52:44,077
Geass will be taken from those lacking resolve.

1855
01:52:44,345 --> 01:52:45,389
However...

1856
01:52:45,967 --> 01:52:48,523
...for those that do have the resolve...
