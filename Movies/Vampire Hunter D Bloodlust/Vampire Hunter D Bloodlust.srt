1
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,266
Here he comes!

2
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:04,543
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.

3
00:04:04,653 --> 00:04:07,535
Blessed art thou among women,
blessed is the Lord, Jesus Christ.

4
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,589
We've been expecting you.

5
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:18,968
I'm Alan Elbourne, and I'm the one that
summoned you here today for this reason...

6
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:24,354
Go on.

7
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:25,600
I'm listening.

8
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:31,272
It's about my sister Charlotte.

9
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:34,878
Two nights ago, she disappeared.

10
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:37,695
She was in bed, sleeping.

11
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:38,905
It was the middle of the night.

12
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,361
Several people told us they
saw a carriage outside our house.

13
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:44,368
The carriage...

14
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:47,580
belonged to Meier Link, the vampire.

15
00:04:49,227 --> 00:04:53,169
I organized a search party of fifty men,
but it was no use. We couldn't find them.

16
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:55,182
We were ambushed.

17
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,948
He took my sister and killed my friends.

18
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:12,885
That's just a down payment.

19
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,690
You'll get the rest when you find her...

20
00:05:15,508 --> 00:05:17,338
$10 million.

21
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:19,862
But you better move fast.

22
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,151
You've got some competition.

23
00:05:21,674 --> 00:05:24,573
I've hired the Markus brothers,
and they've got a head start on you.

24
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,354
I don't think so.

25
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,495
Huh?

26
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:29,475
It may be too late for her.

27
00:05:29,491 --> 00:05:31,862
Your sister may already have been tempted.

28
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:32,635
What then?

29
00:05:34,404 --> 00:05:36,487
You have to get there before that happens!

30
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,643
What do you think we're paying you for?

31
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:38,549
That's enough!

32
00:05:41,522 --> 00:05:43,807
My son is emotional. Please excuse him.

33
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,820
This has been difficult for all of us.

34
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,627
If you knew my daughter, you'd understand.

35
00:05:47,976 --> 00:05:51,916
She's kind and beautiful and her loss
is more than this old soul can bear.

36
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,799
Now I need to ask you something.

37
00:05:55,191 --> 00:05:58,940
If you find her changed, can you see
that her death is without suffering?

38
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,416
Be kind to her, please.

39
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:02,681
No. No! We can't do that!

40
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:03,614
It isn't right!

41
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:07,063
No, she won't be changed.
You're talking about your daughter!

42
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,485
Alan, listen to me.

43
00:06:08,824 --> 00:06:12,837
It's not easy to ask him for this,
but it's something that must be done.

44
00:06:13,795 --> 00:06:16,063
I'm sorry. You understand.

45
00:06:17,675 --> 00:06:19,188
I understand your position, but...

46
00:06:19,807 --> 00:06:21,475
$10 million is not enough.

47
00:06:21,825 --> 00:06:22,336
What?!

48
00:06:22,904 --> 00:06:23,930
How dare you?!

49
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:27,017
Stop it! Hold your fire!

50
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:28,347
I said stop!

51
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:36,664
I'll double the price.

52
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:38,859
I'll give you 20 million.

53
00:06:39,477 --> 00:06:43,064
Just bring her back, one way or the other.

54
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:18,064
Aah! Aah!

55
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:21,901
Did you see a carriage go by
here with four horses in front?

56
00:07:22,013 --> 00:07:22,846
Uh-uh.

57
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:24,760
Let me go!

58
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:26,283
L-Let me go!

59
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:27,948
Aah!

60
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:28,891
You're lying.

61
00:07:41,073 --> 00:07:43,159
Oh, damn. We got company...

62
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,473
Lots of company.

63
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:46,305
Look out!

64
00:08:52,006 --> 00:08:54,227
Oh, man. Is everybody OK?

65
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:54,994
Yeah.

66
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:55,536
Uh-huh.

67
00:08:55,973 --> 00:08:57,297
Do you believe that?

68
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,477
The place is overrun with them.

69
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,969
He must've been here already.

70
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:04,344
Well, come on.

71
00:09:08,051 --> 00:09:09,886
Ready or not, here they come.

72
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,555
It's zombie time.

73
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:15,860
Yeah!

74
00:09:15,876 --> 00:09:17,610
Come and get it, zombies!

75
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:19,782
Amen to that.

76
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:21,938
Leila, are you there?

77
00:09:21,992 --> 00:09:23,508
It won't take long, Grove.

78
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,336
Just stay in the tank.

79
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,365
Lock and load.

80
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:48,589
Uhh!

81
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,321
Yaah!

82
00:10:18,848 --> 00:10:20,781
Not so fast, buddy.

83
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,163
And... fire.

84
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:29,338
Gotcha.

85
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,570
Rest in peace. Huh?

86
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:38,508
You hear that?

87
00:10:40,844 --> 00:10:41,887
Sounds like a horse.

88
00:10:42,707 --> 00:10:44,917
It's moving. Uphill.

89
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:46,718
Let me try.

90
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,155
Right.

91
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,351
Right about...

92
00:10:58,293 --> 00:10:59,045
Hmm.

93
00:11:03,675 --> 00:11:04,599
Right there.

94
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:14,466
Huh?

95
00:11:34,244 --> 00:11:35,871
Beautiful, just beautiful.

96
00:11:36,432 --> 00:11:37,850
I applaud you, stranger.

97
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:39,595
Tell me what you're doing here.

98
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,434
If we're in the same game, we should be friends.

99
00:11:42,848 --> 00:11:43,849
Tell me your name.

100
00:11:44,332 --> 00:11:46,918
Mine's Borgoff-Borgoff Markus.

101
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,903
D.

102
00:11:53,442 --> 00:11:56,904
Ah, so that's the guy-the dunpeal hunter.

103
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,927
I've heard about him. He's amazing.

104
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:02,306
Wake up, Borgoff. He's the
competition, not some buddy of ours.

105
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:05,392
Come on, what are we doing here?
We just helped him. Think about it.

106
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,895
Yeah, he's right. I agree with him about that.

107
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,168
We help him too much, and he'll take all the money.

108
00:12:10,411 --> 00:12:12,788
If it wasn't for us, he'd be dead by now.

109
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,168
We do the work, and he gets the reward.

110
00:12:16,137 --> 00:12:17,987
Aw, you boys should relax.

111
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,186
We just did the famous dunpeal a little favor is all.

112
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:23,222
A little favor we can't afford.

113
00:12:23,238 --> 00:12:26,370
Hey, you ever hear the one about the owl and the squirrel?

114
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:31,126
The squirrel works all summer storing away
stuff for the winter, all kinds of nuts and seeds.

115
00:12:31,337 --> 00:12:32,253
He works real hard.

116
00:12:32,663 --> 00:12:36,548
Then one day, just before the first snow,
he goes outside for one last look around,

117
00:12:36,564 --> 00:12:40,527
when all of a sudden, this owl swoops
down and grabs him, carries him off.

118
00:12:41,216 --> 00:12:43,414
"Ah, what a shame," says the squirrel.

119
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,026
"What's going to happen to all that good food?"

120
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,685
Heh heh heh heh!

121
00:12:49,981 --> 00:12:51,357
Ha ha!

122
00:12:57,482 --> 00:12:59,362
Ah, that's a good one.

123
00:12:59,464 --> 00:13:01,284
Yeah, hilarious.

124
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:06,456
You get it, you guys? That
stupid squirrel is all, like-huh?

125
00:13:06,902 --> 00:13:07,605
Leila.

126
00:13:08,264 --> 00:13:10,058
Hey, Leila, what's the rush?

127
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:15,151
What's with her?

128
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,612
So you're outnumbered 4 to 1. So what?

129
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:29,073
They do have a head start, but when the
sun comes up, the heat will slow 'em down.

130
00:13:31,006 --> 00:13:36,237
Speaking of sun and heat, I know I don't
need to remind you of your susceptibility.

131
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:40,440
It's called heat syndrome, and the
last time you ignored it, you almost...

132
00:13:40,456 --> 00:13:41,792
Don't worry.

133
00:13:42,616 --> 00:13:44,493
I hate it when you say that.

134
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:46,385
What-what are those? Tracks?

135
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,854
Let me see.

136
00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:51,307
Yes. These are definitely their tracks.

137
00:13:51,636 --> 00:13:53,753
6 hours old, I'd say.

138
00:13:54,237 --> 00:13:55,503
OK. Uhh.

139
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:58,135
I'm suffocating now.

140
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,917
Hey, what was that?

141
00:14:02,854 --> 00:14:03,846
That's funny.

142
00:14:04,237 --> 00:14:05,721
I could've sworn I heard something.

143
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:06,721
Quiet.

144
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:10,225
Sandmantas, most likely.

145
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,549
Aah! Aah!

146
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:17,400
Aah!

147
00:14:18,848 --> 00:14:21,533
Great flesh! Sandmantas galore.

148
00:14:21,696 --> 00:14:23,424
Talk about your prehistoric pigeons.

149
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,415
They're filthy animals. You know, they're just filthy.

150
00:14:26,642 --> 00:14:31,738
Well, I guess we'd better just turn back. It's
a shame, really, 'cause, you know, we could've...

151
00:14:31,753 --> 00:14:33,431
hey, whoa! Whoa, whoa!

152
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:35,588
Hey! No, no.

153
00:14:35,604 --> 00:14:39,799
Go back, man. Go back. Come on. You're crazy!

154
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:40,784
Come on, man.

155
00:14:41,118 --> 00:14:44,284
Please, let's just go back. No, no! Here we go! Oh!

156
00:14:46,896 --> 00:14:48,721
Yaah! Not wise.

157
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:53,477
Yaah!

158
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:54,853
Aah!

159
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,854
Ohh!

160
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:58,354
All right, that's enough.

161
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,859
That was good. OK, now, we survived that. Could we stop?

162
00:15:02,572 --> 00:15:04,619
Did you ever hear the expression.

163
00:15:04,857 --> 00:15:07,538
"Too close for comfort"? 'Cause
that was damn uncomfortable.

164
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,550
What is it?

165
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,261
A resting house?

166
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:28,554
I didn't think anybody had those anymore.

167
00:15:28,714 --> 00:15:29,955
He must be in there.

168
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,297
Wow, it blends in nicely.

169
00:16:04,651 --> 00:16:05,773
OK. Whoa.

170
00:16:06,322 --> 00:16:07,117
Here we are.

171
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:11,381
OK, I can see 'em.

172
00:16:12,158 --> 00:16:13,281
How many are there?

173
00:16:13,832 --> 00:16:17,165
Two, I think... a man and a woman.

174
00:16:17,181 --> 00:16:18,429
Look out for the exit door.

175
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,455
OK. No door.

176
00:16:20,933 --> 00:16:21,976
No door there.

177
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,067
Still no door.

178
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:24,592
No.

179
00:16:32,428 --> 00:16:35,715
Are you sure about that door?

180
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,427
No. No.

181
00:16:53,068 --> 00:16:53,727
What was that?

182
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,191
She's out of her mind!

183
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,570
Door! Door!

184
00:17:18,896 --> 00:17:20,209
You're dead!

185
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,926
Aah! Aah!

186
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:33,917
Uhh!

187
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:37,034
Uhh! Ohh! Uhh! Unh!

188
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:07,151
I'm here for the young woman.

189
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:11,019
I wouldn't recommend it, dunpeaL.

190
00:18:11,568 --> 00:18:16,135
Taking on a vampire at night is a
mission for morons and fools. Which are you?

191
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,440
She's here by her own choice, dunpeal.

192
00:18:26,575 --> 00:18:31,349
So unless you're the kind of man who would take
a woman against her will for the money in it...

193
00:18:31,365 --> 00:18:33,242
and I'm sure it's a lot.

194
00:18:33,264 --> 00:18:38,102
I suggest you save your sorry ass
now and leave us to travel in peace.

195
00:18:39,042 --> 00:18:41,122
I would if I could believe you, Meier.

196
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:46,364
Your credibility, however, is less
than impeccable under the circumstances.

197
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:48,463
You kidnapped the girl.

198
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:50,845
Aah!

199
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:57,383
Meier!

200
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,651
Aah!

201
00:19:00,953 --> 00:19:03,551
Uhh! Ow, my nose! My nose!

202
00:19:04,455 --> 00:19:06,582
What happened? What'd I miss?

203
00:19:07,557 --> 00:19:08,742
She called out his name.

204
00:19:09,321 --> 00:19:10,822
It may be true, what he said.

205
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,403
Nah, she's just ignorant.

206
00:19:13,482 --> 00:19:15,951
She's a child. She doesn't know him yet.

207
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,524
She doesn't know what he's capable of.

208
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,241
Ooh.

209
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:39,776
Oh, that poor girl. She's-she's bleeding
pretty bad. I mean, she won't last long.

210
00:19:40,157 --> 00:19:41,965
It's a shame, really...

211
00:19:42,132 --> 00:19:46,386
To waste all that good blood, I mean. Come on, admit it.

212
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:47,813
You're tempted.

213
00:19:47,947 --> 00:19:49,607
I mean, I know you are.

214
00:19:50,728 --> 00:19:51,585
Uhh...

215
00:19:51,896 --> 00:19:52,340
Ma.

216
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:53,675
Mmm.

217
00:19:55,065 --> 00:19:55,695
Mother.

218
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,571
Wait. I was just kidding, you know?
Come on, let's go. We got work to do.

219
00:20:00,587 --> 00:20:02,118
The money-come on, think of the money.

220
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:08,375
Huh?

221
00:20:15,283 --> 00:20:16,633
Uhh.

222
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,518
Hey, what did you do to me?

223
00:20:26,194 --> 00:20:28,838
I bound your wound and stopped your bleeding.

224
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:29,975
That's all.

225
00:20:30,424 --> 00:20:31,444
Oh, I get it.

226
00:20:33,325 --> 00:20:37,109
You think you can just go ahead and tear
off the clothes of whoever you come across.

227
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,428
That's what you think, isn't it, dunpeal?

228
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,011
You should go back home and nurse your wounds.

229
00:20:43,161 --> 00:20:44,538
What are you, my mother?

230
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,497
You called out for your mother before.

231
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:49,049
I thought you might be needing her.

232
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:51,877
Hey!

233
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,671
Uhh. Uhh.

234
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,464
Uhh.

235
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,432
I see her.

236
00:21:19,597 --> 00:21:22,349
When the last vampire is extinct,

237
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:24,149
who will mourn our passing?

238
00:21:24,927 --> 00:21:25,705
Will she?

239
00:21:26,404 --> 00:21:27,293
Will anyone?

240
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:34,961
Can anyone understand this pain, this loneliness?

241
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:04,471
I told you so, didn't I?

242
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:06,830
Hmm? I said leave the girl alone.

243
00:22:06,965 --> 00:22:07,941
She's trouble.

244
00:22:08,141 --> 00:22:10,198
She's competition, you know.

245
00:22:10,634 --> 00:22:12,675
You aided and abetted the enemy.

246
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:24,678
I hope this is the right way.

247
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:29,353
Trust me. I know how they think, these vampires.
When they're threatened, they all head for Barbarois.

248
00:22:29,672 --> 00:22:30,934
They're so predictable.

249
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,352
Barbarois, yeah.

250
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:33,979
I really hate that place.

251
00:22:34,209 --> 00:22:38,124
Full of lunatics and monsters
and that old crazy man, you know?

252
00:22:42,215 --> 00:22:44,223
Does it hurt very much, Leila?

253
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,115
Leila?

254
00:22:46,863 --> 00:22:47,367
Huh?

255
00:22:47,627 --> 00:22:49,730
Your injury-does it hurt you?

256
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:51,579
Oh, no, it's fine.

257
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:52,205
I...

258
00:22:54,451 --> 00:22:55,896
Grove, you should lie down.

259
00:22:55,912 --> 00:22:57,778
You look tired. You need to rest.

260
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:58,884
Don't worry about me.

261
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:00,674
Leila...

262
00:23:01,977 --> 00:23:03,921
Who dressed the wound? Was it him?

263
00:23:05,995 --> 00:23:07,082
You can tell me.

264
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:09,489
It was him, wasn't it? The dunpeal hunter?

265
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:10,515
Mm-hmm.

266
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:12,767
Leila, I'm warning you...

267
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:15,154
He-he's trouble. He's against us.

268
00:23:15,336 --> 00:23:16,879
I don't know why he did that.

269
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,748
Grove, please don't tell anyone, OK?

270
00:23:30,736 --> 00:23:31,728
He stopped there,

271
00:23:32,427 --> 00:23:33,356
but what for?

272
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:35,206
Let's find out.

273
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,417
Nolt and Kyle, you come with me.

274
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,281
Leila, you stay in here with Grove.

275
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:42,038
OK, is everybody ready?

276
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:42,673
Always.

277
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:43,078
Ready. Yeah.

278
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,829
Hey, Nolt,

279
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,794
see what's going on in there, will you?

280
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,159
It may be a trap.

281
00:24:18,486 --> 00:24:20,210
Yeah. We'll cover you.

282
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,337
It'll be my pleasure, gentlemen.

283
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,009
Aah!

284
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:46,054
Huh?

285
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:54,308
It's nothing but a lousy piece of cloth.

286
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:56,080
What the hell?

287
00:24:56,247 --> 00:24:58,471
Bastard. Unbelievable.

288
00:24:59,489 --> 00:25:00,667
Hey, watch out!

289
00:25:00,683 --> 00:25:01,516
Huh?

290
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:04,391
So...

291
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:08,918
You dare to enter Barbarois.

292
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:15,902
I assume it's arrogance and not
stupidity that brings you here, gentlemen.

293
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:19,072
Or perhaps it's ignorance.

294
00:25:19,378 --> 00:25:22,226
You're skillful hunters, I can see,

295
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:25,705
but you are no match for the Barbarois.

296
00:25:26,037 --> 00:25:31,626
5,000 years of isolation have made us invincible.

297
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:36,037
Aah! Unh!

298
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:42,959
Huh?

299
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:43,954
What?

300
00:25:49,064 --> 00:25:50,613
What the hell's going on?

301
00:25:56,646 --> 00:25:57,546
The shadow...

302
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,960
Watch out for the shadow.

303
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:03,487
What are you talking about?

304
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:05,456
The shadow? What do you mean?

305
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:09,262
Hey, Nolt?

306
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,182
Hey, Nolt, what the hell happened to you, huh?

307
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:24,000
He-he's dead.

308
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:25,126
No, he's not!

309
00:26:25,511 --> 00:26:27,615
Come on, Nolt. Come on!

310
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:29,760
Snap out of it! Come on!

311
00:26:30,741 --> 00:26:33,105
Oh, my god! Damn it, come on!

312
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:35,194
I need you!

313
00:26:36,598 --> 00:26:37,958
Oh, God!

314
00:26:38,592 --> 00:26:39,206
Oh!

315
00:26:54,243 --> 00:26:56,394
Oh, God, we're getting close.

316
00:26:56,825 --> 00:27:00,158
Those are the windmills of the Barbarois.

317
00:27:00,248 --> 00:27:02,022
I really wish you'd turn back.

318
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:03,657
There must be another way.

319
00:27:04,182 --> 00:27:05,197
There isn't.

320
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:21,015
I am D the hunter.

321
00:27:21,567 --> 00:27:23,448
I have business with the Barbarois.

322
00:27:59,264 --> 00:28:01,057
Oh, no.

323
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:15,291
So, I see you have dismounted. You have respect
for your elders. That's very considerate indeed.

324
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:23,412
I want you to stop your protection of Meier Link.

325
00:28:24,174 --> 00:28:25,204
You what?

326
00:28:25,615 --> 00:28:29,528
Ha ha ha. You know, you make me laugh. That's a good one.

327
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:33,713
I see you are a very humorous young
man. And beautiful, too, I might add.

328
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:37,489
Or does that make you uncomfortable to
have an old lech like me admire you so?

329
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:39,469
You take me for a fool.

330
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:43,997
Someone paid me $100 million to
protect Meier Link. Can you top that?

331
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:47,018
Well, you drive a hard bargain there, old man.

332
00:28:47,621 --> 00:28:48,599
What if I can?

333
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:53,951
You really are entertaining me, Mr. Stranger.

334
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,319
I suppose you know our reputation.

335
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:59,322
The Barbarois serve the people of the night,

336
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:04,702
and after 5,000 years, I don't think we're
about to change our stripes any time soon.

337
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:07,121
Although, if we did for anyone, it would be for you.

338
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:13,115
I have seen many a dunpeal, but
somebody like you, I've never seen before.

339
00:29:13,588 --> 00:29:17,048
That's why it's such a pity that you have to die.

340
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:20,385
I really can't let you leave here alive, now, can I?

341
00:29:20,536 --> 00:29:24,305
I'm afraid you have to die, stranger. So sorry.

342
00:29:25,335 --> 00:29:27,558
The Barbarois are great warriors.

343
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:32,428
You are a warrior, too, no doubt, and although
you may kill some of us, in the end, we will prevail.

344
00:29:32,444 --> 00:29:34,273
I have sworn to protect the carriage.

345
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,567
Prepare to die.

346
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,549
Fool.

347
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,477
What's he doing in there?

348
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:50,655
Borgoff, are we ready yet?

349
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:53,543
Grove...

350
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,615
We have no choice. We need your help on this, Grove.

351
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,216
Think you can do it there, man?

352
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,399
Give it to me. I'm waiting.

353
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,767
Don't push yourself too hard now. I mean it, OK?

354
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:10,890
I want you back.

355
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,846
You know, I really have nothing
against the Barbarois personally.

356
00:30:21,163 --> 00:30:23,290
It's a shame I'll have to kill so many of you.

357
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:27,171
Indeed, I admire your loyalty and your devotion to duty.

358
00:30:27,298 --> 00:30:31,581
Yet I wonder about the fairness when
you allow one to fight against so many.

359
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:34,407
But if that will entertain you...

360
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,711
Ohh.

361
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:37,918
I see.

362
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:41,007
Well, you make a good argument, young man.

363
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:42,296
How interesting.

364
00:30:42,312 --> 00:30:44,068
Old man...

365
00:30:44,328 --> 00:30:47,339
I think the fellow is right.

366
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:53,853
Please allow the three of us to entertain our
young guest here, unless he thinks that's unfair.

367
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:56,314
Three against one... how unfair.

368
00:30:56,314 --> 00:30:58,550
Three against one-unfair.

369
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,187
That's enough.

370
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:03,753
You mock us with your ridiculous antics, Benge.

371
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:08,950
I will not have you distracting us from the job
at hand, which is the protection of the carriage.

372
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:11,309
We'll do things my way. Huh?

373
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,650
What the devil is that?

374
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:39,860
Go for it, Grove! Go for it!

375
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:41,734
Kill all those guys!

376
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:42,990
Kill every last one of them!

377
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:48,241
Come on, Grove.

378
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:49,162
Hold on.

379
00:31:57,603 --> 00:32:00,009
Get the carriage out, now!

380
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,569
Follow me, Tinkerbell.

381
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,010
I'm waiting for you.

382
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:13,766
Uhh!

383
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,602
Yaah!

384
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:37,206
Grove.

385
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:48,998
I've got to say this,

386
00:32:49,196 --> 00:32:51,387
I admire that young hunter's spirit,

387
00:32:51,906 --> 00:32:54,765
although he doesn't stand a
chance against Benge and the others.

388
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:56,608
Still, it's a pity I'll miss the show.

389
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:58,436
Oh, well. C'est la vie.

390
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:32,219
Wake up, D.

391
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:33,929
What's wrong with you?

392
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:41,354
It's not fair. It's not fair.

393
00:33:41,354 --> 00:33:43,022
I'll show you what's not fair.

394
00:33:43,022 --> 00:33:45,608
Stay there till you rot, hunter.

395
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,608
Aw, phooey, suckers.

396
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:05,653
Stop. I beg you.

397
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:07,139
Say good night.

398
00:34:10,253 --> 00:34:13,041
Kyle, did you happen to see where that girl went?

399
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,845
Maybe she got caught in the wheels.

400
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:15,965
Go look.

401
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:39,245
Aah!

402
00:34:58,581 --> 00:35:00,542
Nice, Caroline, very nice.

403
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:02,601
A little crude, but effective.

404
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,014
They're all yours.

405
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,024
That freakin' monster.

406
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:11,261
Is everybody all right?

407
00:35:11,444 --> 00:35:14,009
Yeah, but Kyle was outside. He was up on top.

408
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:20,159
Kyle. Kyle. Where the hell are you, Kyle?

409
00:35:20,175 --> 00:35:21,176
Down here.

410
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:22,653
You OK?

411
00:35:22,705 --> 00:35:24,510
Quiet. They're still around.

412
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:33,007
No.

413
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:36,554
Damn. That idiot.

414
00:35:37,025 --> 00:35:39,804
Well, how convenient this is for me.

415
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:42,188
Come on out here so I can finish the job.

416
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:43,332
Your time is up.

417
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:45,025
Come on, you cowards!

418
00:35:45,112 --> 00:35:47,511
You're going to pay for the pain you caused my brother.

419
00:35:52,337 --> 00:35:55,060
Hey, D, are you awake?

420
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:03,473
I need your help to swallow up this spell.

421
00:36:04,911 --> 00:36:07,294
You're a slave driver, you know that?

422
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,311
Aah!

423
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,033
Hey, remember to watch out for the shadow, huh?

424
00:36:46,931 --> 00:36:48,568
Try and stay still.

425
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:50,213
Easier said than done.

426
00:36:50,355 --> 00:36:51,899
And keep your mouth shut.

427
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,564
Aah! Aah! Ahh! Ahh!

428
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:14,084
That was close.

429
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:23,701
Waah!

430
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:30,708
Well, the tank is full of holes.

431
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:33,014
The fuel's all gone.

432
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,851
We can't drive it like this anyway.

433
00:37:35,097 --> 00:37:35,880
What are we going to do?

434
00:37:38,226 --> 00:37:39,717
What should we do?

435
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:41,879
Borgoff, any idea?

436
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,181
How's Grove?

437
00:37:46,581 --> 00:37:48,258
Honestly, not too great.

438
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:51,172
Borgoff, wake up. What are you thinking about over there?

439
00:37:52,447 --> 00:37:55,249
Oh, nothing, really. I was
just thinking about the carriage.

440
00:37:55,632 --> 00:37:56,926
Wonder where it is by now.

441
00:37:57,151 --> 00:37:59,967
Well hell, man, at this point,
it's pretty much anybody's guess.

442
00:38:00,334 --> 00:38:01,749
If you want my opinion,

443
00:38:01,764 --> 00:38:07,657
I'd say they're either setting sail from the port of Ebral
or hiding somewhere deep in the Granerj mountain range.

444
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:09,294
I sure hope so.

445
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:13,887
Anyway, we still have to get some fuel,

446
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:17,004
and the town of Garucia isn't that far away from here.

447
00:38:17,456 --> 00:38:19,137
Kyle, you go with Leila.

448
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:21,752
I'll stay here and do the repairs.

449
00:38:33,864 --> 00:38:36,815
"If you are seeking the pathway to the stars,

450
00:38:36,865 --> 00:38:42,019
"come to me. I pray for your
safe arrival with all my heart."

451
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,927
"The pathway to the stars..."

452
00:39:07,328 --> 00:39:10,241
I don't know about you, but I sure miss that horse.

453
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:12,017
What was his name?

454
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,022
Oh, the silent treatment, huh?

455
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:17,606
Well, I got two words heat syndrome.

456
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:21,981
Look. Look, I know I'm a parasite, but
haven't I always been a helpful parasite?

457
00:39:21,997 --> 00:39:27,274
Now, you may not care if you die from heat, but becoming
a piece of beef jerky is not a lifelong ambition of mine.

458
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:29,898
Yeah, well, what's the sound of one hand yapping?

459
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:43,722
How much?

460
00:39:43,947 --> 00:39:45,436
Oh, no. Keep your money.

461
00:39:45,827 --> 00:39:47,087
Come on. Just take it.

462
00:39:50,014 --> 00:39:50,711
Let's go.

463
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:54,033
Leila!

464
00:39:54,984 --> 00:39:56,898
Oh, I see.

465
00:39:58,083 --> 00:39:59,334
It's him, isn't it?

466
00:40:00,821 --> 00:40:02,907
Kyle, why don't you start back without me?

467
00:40:03,853 --> 00:40:05,902
There's something I want to do here first.

468
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:10,612
Back off.

469
00:40:10,977 --> 00:40:15,205
Have I told you you're quite
irresistible in that sexy, skintight getup?

470
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:17,406
No. Tell me about it.

471
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:18,417
I just did.

472
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:21,497
You make sure you watch your back with that guy, Leila.

473
00:40:37,808 --> 00:40:38,855
I'd like a beer.

474
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:55,370
I've just been admiring your fancy weapon there.

475
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:59,277
Don't worry. I have no plans to use it anytime soon.

476
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:00,770
That's good.

477
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:05,590
That's good, because I have no plans to let you keep it.

478
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:07,424
Give it up.

479
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,757
You heard me, little girl.

480
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:15,099
Uhh!

481
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,107
Hmm. Thank you.

482
00:41:23,995 --> 00:41:25,705
Well, here's to you, sheriff.

483
00:41:26,098 --> 00:41:27,407
I'd buy you a drink, but...

484
00:41:27,553 --> 00:41:29,305
Thank you, but no, thanks.

485
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:36,324
Oh, OK. I was just gonna say you must be awfully
busy with that new dunpeal hunter in the town now.

486
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:38,676
What dunpeal hunter?

487
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:46,884
I'd like to buy that horse.

488
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,284
$300,000.

489
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:55,120
And if you don't like the price, go somewhere else.

490
00:42:15,671 --> 00:42:19,791
Freeze! Put your hands where I can see 'em! Now!

491
00:42:21,404 --> 00:42:23,500
Sheriff, he paid good money for that.

492
00:42:29,221 --> 00:42:30,167
What are you doing?

493
00:42:30,571 --> 00:42:31,930
Take your money and go.

494
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:35,345
We don't want you here.

495
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:38,006
We don't sell to dunpeals in this town.

496
00:42:39,016 --> 00:42:39,850
Understand?

497
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,283
Understand me, dunpeal?

498
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:46,064
You understand.

499
00:42:46,334 --> 00:42:49,408
Wait a minute. That's my horse you're talking about there,

500
00:42:49,543 --> 00:42:53,405
and I'll sell it to whoever I want if
they can afford the price I'm asking.

501
00:42:53,906 --> 00:42:56,860
You can't do that. We have laws against it, Polk.

502
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,203
Good laws and for a damn good reason.

503
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:00,579
What laws?

504
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:04,649
Don't play coy, Polk. You know as
well as I, dunpeals aren't allowed.

505
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,682
Not allowed. Right.

506
00:43:06,737 --> 00:43:13,102
I remember a time not that long ago when we
had vampires and dunpeals both around here, but...

507
00:43:13,371 --> 00:43:15,636
And that's why we have the law!

508
00:43:15,636 --> 00:43:19,647
Listen to me whether you want to hear it or
not. You weren't even born when this happened.

509
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:22,150
Do yourself a favor and listen to the story.

510
00:43:22,792 --> 00:43:26,104
I'm going to tell you about the
time when the children were kidnapped.

511
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:28,475
There were ten children altogether...

512
00:43:29,191 --> 00:43:30,588
Yeah, I heard about that time.

513
00:43:31,663 --> 00:43:34,545
The kidnappers turned out to be vampires, of course,

514
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:39,080
and so the townspeople pooled
their money to hire a vampire hunter.

515
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:40,663
They wanted the best.

516
00:43:41,591 --> 00:43:43,077
And when the hunter came,

517
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:45,587
he was a very strong and quiet man,

518
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:51,588
and he did his job, too, which was to return
the children safely back into their parents' homes.

519
00:43:51,983 --> 00:43:57,193
It wasn't easy, but many vampires died
by his hands before this job was over with.

520
00:43:57,672 --> 00:44:02,184
And when it was over and the children
were back home, the people attacked the man.

521
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:06,812
They said he was a dunpeal half-vampire
himself, so they punished him.

522
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,021
Can't say I blame them for doing that.

523
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:13,307
You can't trust 'em. That's all that's about.

524
00:44:13,527 --> 00:44:15,245
They were right about that part, Polk.

525
00:44:16,822 --> 00:44:18,098
He did the job.

526
00:44:18,543 --> 00:44:22,237
I see, then, I'll have to take matters into my own hands.

527
00:44:22,344 --> 00:44:23,348
Let him go!

528
00:44:24,853 --> 00:44:25,647
And what is that?

529
00:44:26,649 --> 00:44:27,984
What does it look like, idiot?

530
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,209
Put down your guns!

531
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:31,253
Polk, you can't know what you're doing.

532
00:44:31,253 --> 00:44:32,212
Put it down.

533
00:44:32,212 --> 00:44:34,214
I know exactly what I'm doing.

534
00:44:34,414 --> 00:44:37,542
You don't know! Put it down now, you old fool!

535
00:44:39,136 --> 00:44:43,384
I would much rather be an old
fool than what you are, sheriff.

536
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:47,009
Now, don't shoot.

537
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:53,564
I can tell you I won't think twice about
using this weapon. I might even enjoy it.

538
00:44:53,842 --> 00:44:55,517
Get on your horse, stranger.

539
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:56,869
Thank you.

540
00:44:57,924 --> 00:45:00,713
No. It's only fitting I thank you.

541
00:45:00,935 --> 00:45:02,311
It's the least I can do.

542
00:45:04,804 --> 00:45:09,881
I may be just an old fool now, stranger,
but I could never forget a face like yours.

543
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:12,794
And I'll never forget what you done for me backthen.

544
00:45:13,263 --> 00:45:14,243
That's right.

545
00:45:14,649 --> 00:45:16,071
I was one of them kids.

546
00:45:22,054 --> 00:45:24,027
And I always felt bad about that.

547
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:27,847
The way you was treated. How nobody stopped you.

548
00:45:28,378 --> 00:45:30,661
Nobody thanked you. Instead, the ignorant bastards

549
00:45:30,836 --> 00:45:32,392
ran you right out of our town.

550
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:36,401
So it's true, isn't it, what they say about you dunpeals?

551
00:45:37,146 --> 00:45:40,024
You don't age. Now, go. I'm getting tired.

552
00:46:00,097 --> 00:46:01,288
Where's Benge?

553
00:46:02,089 --> 00:46:04,171
What's taking him so long?

554
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:07,057
Well, the horses are rested now.

555
00:46:07,057 --> 00:46:07,960
We better go.

556
00:46:08,706 --> 00:46:09,373
Come on.

557
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:16,969
Master, what is it? May I help you, sir?

558
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:21,161
It's still light outside, master!

559
00:46:23,404 --> 00:46:23,946
What?

560
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:26,691
Leave her alone, Machira.

561
00:46:27,202 --> 00:46:27,911
Yes, sir.

562
00:46:28,848 --> 00:46:32,143
She misses the sunlight. Let her enjoy it.

563
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:18,683
I am D, a hunter. Your father sent me.

564
00:47:19,537 --> 00:47:22,298
Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.

565
00:47:24,667 --> 00:47:28,232
You sit in the sunlight. You must not be changed.

566
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:31,338
So, why do you stay with him?

567
00:47:32,227 --> 00:47:34,561
Last night in the carriage, you called out his name.

568
00:47:36,788 --> 00:47:38,076
Why did you call for him?

569
00:47:41,835 --> 00:47:45,600
I suppose my father has not told
you that I'm in love with Meier.

570
00:47:45,739 --> 00:47:47,908
You don't know who he is.

571
00:47:48,158 --> 00:47:49,668
You can't be in love with him.

572
00:47:49,731 --> 00:47:53,131
Well, I am. If you only knew how good he's been to me.

573
00:47:53,926 --> 00:47:54,934
I love him.

574
00:47:56,779 --> 00:47:59,336
Please believe me. No one else will.

575
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:02,467
You don't understand.

576
00:48:04,217 --> 00:48:05,636
He is what he is, Charlotte.

577
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:08,719
You can't change him. He'll take you in time,

578
00:48:08,841 --> 00:48:11,385
and when that happens, I will have to kill you.

579
00:48:11,985 --> 00:48:13,528
Fine. Kill me then.

580
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,791
I would rather die than to go anywhere without him.

581
00:48:16,865 --> 00:48:21,208
Don't take me back there! I mean it!
I simply could not live without Meier.

582
00:48:21,271 --> 00:48:23,639
How sweet that is. Ha!

583
00:48:25,171 --> 00:48:26,923
She loves a vampire.

584
00:48:28,453 --> 00:48:30,247
So very sweet.

585
00:48:31,785 --> 00:48:32,536
Idiot!

586
00:48:33,912 --> 00:48:36,408
You stupid girl! Get up! We're going!

587
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:37,707
Leave me alone!

588
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:40,293
You'll do what I say!

589
00:48:40,293 --> 00:48:44,338
Do you have any idea how many people
have died at the hands of your beloved Meier,

590
00:48:44,363 --> 00:48:45,715
this vampire you want to protect?

591
00:48:45,715 --> 00:48:46,258
None!

592
00:48:48,093 --> 00:48:49,649
You fool! And you!

593
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,345
You stay right where you are, my friend.

594
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:56,277
Sorry, but I really don't want
to have to share any of my profits.

595
00:48:57,701 --> 00:48:59,327
You understand, don't you?

596
00:48:59,486 --> 00:49:00,696
It's business.

597
00:49:08,113 --> 00:49:08,780
Above you.

598
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:18,534
Aah!

599
00:49:40,044 --> 00:49:41,880
What's wrong? Tell me!

600
00:49:46,293 --> 00:49:47,919
Too much sun!

601
00:49:54,235 --> 00:49:57,802
I warned you about the heat, but you don't listen!

602
00:50:09,848 --> 00:50:13,223
Come on! You can't survive unless you dig a hole!

603
00:50:13,239 --> 00:50:15,274
You need to bury yourself!

604
00:50:21,391 --> 00:50:24,352
Oh! Ha ha ha ha!

605
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:00,251
Hurry!

606
00:51:36,866 --> 00:51:39,654
Leila? Leila, are you there?

607
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:40,941
Come in, Leila.

608
00:51:41,688 --> 00:51:42,684
Yeah, I copy.

609
00:51:42,684 --> 00:51:44,561
Thank God! Are you OK?

610
00:51:44,561 --> 00:51:45,881
What's your position?

611
00:51:46,572 --> 00:51:49,432
I'm near Lake Chiffon. Our
game is heading north from here.

612
00:51:50,108 --> 00:51:50,925
We'll catch up.

613
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,230
Leila, do you know what's happened to the dunpeal hunter?

614
00:51:54,856 --> 00:51:57,083
No. I haven't seen him.

615
00:51:57,099 --> 00:51:58,911
All right. Well, take care.

616
00:51:59,009 --> 00:52:01,039
Stay in touch. Borgoff out.

617
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:15,315
Ha! The tables have turned.

618
00:52:30,982 --> 00:52:31,479
Uhh!

619
00:52:42,452 --> 00:52:42,994
No!

620
00:52:49,862 --> 00:52:51,909
Now, that cleared my head.

621
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:55,715
I really should return the favor, don't you think, honey?

622
00:53:51,521 --> 00:53:53,287
Don't get any ideas.

623
00:53:54,107 --> 00:53:56,276
Hey, I'm just trying to stay dry here.

624
00:53:57,323 --> 00:54:00,280
If there was any other place
to go, believe me, I'd be there.

625
00:54:00,549 --> 00:54:03,908
As soon as the rain lets up,
I'll be gone from here and from you.

626
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:12,884
I think I can guess your problem.

627
00:54:13,354 --> 00:54:16,462
Your family was the victim of vampires.

628
00:54:17,536 --> 00:54:19,430
You don't know what you're talking about.

629
00:54:20,359 --> 00:54:22,169
You don't know anything about it.

630
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:25,465
All right. Perhaps I don't.

631
00:54:27,191 --> 00:54:29,735
This stupid thing, it bothers me.

632
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,524
You really are a weird one, you know that?

633
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:37,892
In spite of being a dunpeal
hunter and all that that entails.

634
00:54:38,617 --> 00:54:40,660
How did you know about my mother?

635
00:54:40,987 --> 00:54:43,040
You called her name, remember?

636
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:45,773
She was kidnapped by vampires.

637
00:54:45,901 --> 00:54:50,379
My father went after her. He was
trying to rescue her, so they killed him.

638
00:54:51,308 --> 00:54:55,005
And after a while, my mother returned,
but she wasn't my mother anymore.

639
00:54:55,376 --> 00:54:56,721
She'd been changed.

640
00:54:57,024 --> 00:55:00,313
The people in the village stoned
her to death while I watched.

641
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,799
After that, I left home.

642
00:55:02,236 --> 00:55:04,510
I met the Markus brothers and joined with them.

643
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:07,847
I wanted to be a hunter to avenge my parents' deaths.

644
00:55:08,165 --> 00:55:10,208
I've seen many terrible things since then-

645
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:14,136
lives destroyed, families devastated, hopes crushed.

646
00:55:14,582 --> 00:55:17,504
Every time, it seems a vampire is to blame.

647
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:21,486
I can understand why you'd choose to do it,

648
00:55:21,686 --> 00:55:24,102
but the life of a hunter's no kind of life.

649
00:55:24,324 --> 00:55:29,202
It's the only life I'm any good for now, and it
looks like it's the only life you've ever known,

650
00:55:29,661 --> 00:55:31,710
so I suggest we make a pact.

651
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,441
Since we're both in it for the long haul,

652
00:55:34,457 --> 00:55:40,378
whoever dies first, the other one can come
and bring flowers to their grave. How's that?

653
00:55:40,924 --> 00:55:44,017
It's the rain. Makes me sentimental.

654
00:55:44,194 --> 00:55:47,657
I don't know why I should care
about that. It's just I love flowers,

655
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:49,635
and I don't think I'll be getting any.

656
00:55:49,722 --> 00:55:51,307
I'm all alone, after all.

657
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,060
We have that much in common, don't we?

658
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,104
That we're both hunters and we're both alone?

659
00:55:56,938 --> 00:55:58,875
Oh, well. I'm being silly.

660
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:00,480
It doesn't really matter.

661
00:56:01,234 --> 00:56:01,942
I'll do it.

662
00:56:03,713 --> 00:56:07,640
I'll bring you flowers if I
survive this, but I don't expect to.

663
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:10,253
Oh, stop. I didn't really mean it when I said that.

664
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:14,327
And anyway, I don't really understand
why you should keep on doing this.

665
00:56:18,126 --> 00:56:19,502
Because I'm a dunpeal.

666
00:56:20,192 --> 00:56:23,112
I don't get to have a life, not like you.

667
00:56:56,314 --> 00:56:59,487
Well, with the rainstorm last
night, they can't be too far away.

668
00:57:00,747 --> 00:57:03,743
We're even now, dunpeal. Understand?

669
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:15,853
I have a very bad feeling about this.

670
00:57:16,139 --> 00:57:16,910
How so?

671
00:57:17,254 --> 00:57:20,547
I think I finally figured it out, Borgoff.

672
00:57:21,959 --> 00:57:23,893
Well, I'm sure you're right,

673
00:57:24,144 --> 00:57:26,187
if you're thinking they're headed for the castle.

674
00:57:27,022 --> 00:57:30,156
Yeah, that's right, the castle-the Castle of Chaythe.

675
00:57:30,156 --> 00:57:34,994
What are you thinking? We can't go in
there! It would be suicide! It would be insane!

676
00:57:35,536 --> 00:57:39,332
What are you now, afraid of a little
insanity? Since when have we been sane?

677
00:57:39,749 --> 00:57:42,168
We just have to get to them before they reach the castle.

678
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:45,536
There's a bridge up ahead.

679
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:48,174
That's where we intercept the carriage.

680
00:57:48,508 --> 00:57:52,261
I remember that trick from the
time we got those vampires at Keldo.

681
00:57:52,261 --> 00:57:55,592
Yeah. It worked that time, and it can work again now.

682
00:57:56,057 --> 00:57:58,603
Leila, come in. Come in, Leila. Over.

683
00:57:58,888 --> 00:58:00,272
Yeah, it's me. I copy.

684
00:58:00,637 --> 00:58:01,520
What's up?

685
00:58:01,854 --> 00:58:03,022
I'm on my way.

686
00:58:30,975 --> 00:58:31,412
Uhh!

687
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:39,274
Don't move. I'm warning you!

688
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:42,832
Try anything funny, and you'll be blown to smithereens.

689
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:45,470
You want to try it?

690
00:58:46,274 --> 00:58:47,512
I didn't think so.

691
00:58:49,602 --> 00:58:51,000
We just want the girl.

692
00:58:59,829 --> 00:59:00,827
Hello there!

693
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:02,963
She's still human!

694
00:59:03,713 --> 00:59:06,382
Come on, get out of there! Now!

695
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:09,937
Borgoff, she won't come!

696
00:59:11,059 --> 00:59:12,661
We're doing you a favor!

697
00:59:17,206 --> 00:59:18,366
Come on!

698
00:59:18,826 --> 00:59:20,376
I said get out of there!

699
00:59:20,641 --> 00:59:21,058
Uhh!

700
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:34,055
Let that be a lesson to you,
you cowardly Barbarois animal!

701
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:35,135
Borgoff, look!

702
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:36,365
Borgoff!

703
00:59:36,365 --> 00:59:36,906
What?

704
00:59:37,477 --> 00:59:38,184
What the...

705
00:59:49,541 --> 00:59:51,383
What, is this guy crazy?

706
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,504
Doesn't he know he can't exist
outside here in the sunlight?

707
00:59:56,344 --> 00:59:58,960
I won't let you take her!

708
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:00,222
Oh, yeah?

709
01:00:03,104 --> 01:00:03,604
Uhh!

710
01:00:04,879 --> 01:00:07,397
Thanks a lot. You're making our job a lot easier.

711
01:00:07,565 --> 01:00:08,733
Hot enough for you?

712
01:00:08,955 --> 01:00:10,099
It's what you deserve!

713
01:00:11,192 --> 01:00:11,751
Uhh!

714
01:00:23,481 --> 01:00:25,378
Over here, hot stuff.

715
01:00:27,972 --> 01:00:29,640
Hoo hoo! Look at him burn!

716
01:00:32,813 --> 01:00:35,077
Here, a little something to help you walk.

717
01:00:36,247 --> 01:00:37,051
How does that feel?

718
01:00:37,051 --> 01:00:38,344
Way to go, moron.

719
01:00:39,583 --> 01:00:41,839
That got him! What now? Don't you...

720
01:00:44,953 --> 01:00:45,653
Look at him!

721
01:00:46,149 --> 01:00:47,525
Hey, where do you think...

722
01:00:47,812 --> 01:00:48,901
Why'd you let her go?

723
01:01:00,801 --> 01:01:01,760
I love you.

724
01:01:13,691 --> 01:01:14,488
Uhh!

725
01:01:20,599 --> 01:01:22,604
I can't go on without you.

726
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:28,649
What?!

727
01:01:34,856 --> 01:01:37,359
Borgoff, we should just let her kill herself,

728
01:01:37,814 --> 01:01:39,190
and then we can finish him off.

729
01:01:39,206 --> 01:01:40,514
What do you think about that idea?

730
01:01:40,598 --> 01:01:42,434
We get the money if she's dead or alive.

731
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:43,951
Hey, you're right! OK.

732
01:01:51,809 --> 01:01:52,609
Stop it!

733
01:01:53,492 --> 01:01:53,937
Uhh!

734
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:58,924
Kyle!

735
01:02:00,848 --> 01:02:02,118
I'll blow you to hell!

736
01:02:03,638 --> 01:02:04,804
Aah!

737
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:06,223
What?!

738
01:02:10,728 --> 01:02:11,328
No!

739
01:02:36,337 --> 01:02:39,025
I don't want you to worry about these wounds of mine.

740
01:02:40,633 --> 01:02:41,561
They will heal.

741
01:02:41,648 --> 01:02:44,912
Then we shall go to the City of Night in Distant Stars.

742
01:02:46,097 --> 01:02:49,558
When we go there, we can be
alone and free to love each other.

743
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:53,762
It's true. Believe me.

744
01:02:54,899 --> 01:02:56,550
We'll be there soon.

745
01:03:41,515 --> 01:03:42,808
We're it now.

746
01:03:43,558 --> 01:03:47,397
We're the only ones left,
Borgoff. We should just give it up.

747
01:03:50,266 --> 01:03:54,213
If we make it into that castle,
none of us will make it out alive.

748
01:03:54,386 --> 01:03:55,905
We can't quit now.

749
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:00,091
We owe it to Kyle and to Nolt to keep going on.

750
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:03,966
Listen, Borgoff...

751
01:04:03,966 --> 01:04:05,758
Shut up! I won't hear it!

752
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:12,728
Leila, what do you think?

753
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:15,227
Grove, they fear us.

754
01:04:15,436 --> 01:04:21,660
They fear us because they know our reputation,
that we never give up and we never can.

755
01:04:22,186 --> 01:04:25,762
If we quit now, we might as well
quit the business, and I can't do that.

756
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:29,248
I won't do it, till every last one of them is gone.

757
01:04:49,054 --> 01:04:51,911
Master, do you hear?

758
01:04:53,182 --> 01:04:54,237
He's coming.

759
01:04:54,865 --> 01:04:56,232
The castle is nearby.

760
01:04:56,403 --> 01:04:57,905
I'll stay here and deal with him.

761
01:05:23,807 --> 01:05:26,444
We're getting close. The Castle of Chaythe.

762
01:05:26,792 --> 01:05:28,334
Soon we'll be able to see it.

763
01:05:29,211 --> 01:05:32,154
The home of Carmila, the Bloody Countess.

764
01:05:32,721 --> 01:05:33,576
You've heard of her.

765
01:05:33,835 --> 01:05:38,620
For 5,000 years, her rule of
terror lasted, and then that was that.

766
01:05:43,691 --> 01:05:47,209
Your father, the Vampire King, grew angry.

767
01:05:47,486 --> 01:05:52,658
He was impatient with her vanity,
offended by her bloodlust, her gluttony.

768
01:05:52,969 --> 01:05:54,692
He grew so tired

769
01:05:54,828 --> 01:05:59,915
that he killed her while she slept, impaling
her on his sword, and that was it for her.

770
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:06,839
Except she haunts the place now with phantoms
and demons, but you don't care about that, do you?

771
01:06:07,484 --> 01:06:10,654
But I bet I know what really gets to you, dunpeal, eh?

772
01:06:11,055 --> 01:06:12,765
What really gets to you.

773
01:06:13,182 --> 01:06:18,392
The thought of those two lovebirds giving
birth to another dunpeal, huh? That's it.

774
01:06:19,337 --> 01:06:23,564
See? I know you. I know how
you think. I know how you feel.

775
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:27,512
I know every move that you make. You can't-uhh!

776
01:07:38,265 --> 01:07:40,750
I'm glad we could meet at last, hunter D.

777
01:07:41,146 --> 01:07:42,602
You are a worthy opponent.

778
01:07:45,014 --> 01:07:46,493
Who hired the Barbarois?

779
01:07:46,966 --> 01:07:48,399
Who were you working for?

780
01:07:50,253 --> 01:07:55,740
Uhh! It was Carmila who hired us, and as
a Barbarois, my duty has been fulfilled.

781
01:07:56,126 --> 01:07:58,387
Now I can die in peace.

782
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:09,103
I gather from your letter that
you've had a rather difficult time.

783
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:11,505
I think I can understand what it's like.

784
01:08:11,643 --> 01:08:13,790
Love is not unique to humans, you know.

785
01:08:13,806 --> 01:08:16,038
We vampires are very susceptible.

786
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:18,238
I hope I can be of service.

787
01:08:18,555 --> 01:08:20,359
We're very grateful, Carmila.

788
01:08:25,197 --> 01:08:27,018
You both must be exhausted.

789
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:28,812
Perhaps you should rest first.

790
01:08:28,828 --> 01:08:31,347
I'm sure that the young lady would like to freshen up.

791
01:08:34,796 --> 01:08:35,362
Hmm.

792
01:08:40,687 --> 01:08:42,750
You've probably heard rumors about me,

793
01:08:42,998 --> 01:08:46,482
but I can assure you they all stem from jealousy and envy.

794
01:08:46,744 --> 01:08:49,905
I'm not the "Bloody Carmila" they like to portray me as.

795
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,911
Now, behold.

796
01:09:00,647 --> 01:09:03,257
That's it. That is the ship.

797
01:09:04,911 --> 01:09:06,879
It will take you to the City of the Night,

798
01:09:07,155 --> 01:09:09,293
where you can live peacefully at last.

799
01:09:10,147 --> 01:09:11,731
You can be happy there.

800
01:09:13,014 --> 01:09:15,261
There was a time, many years ago,

801
01:09:15,612 --> 01:09:17,692
when every castle had a ship like this one

802
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:20,980
and the night sky was full of their flashing lights.

803
01:09:22,451 --> 01:09:24,831
Those were the days when vampires flourished

804
01:09:24,995 --> 01:09:27,873
and a love like yours was not so desperately impossible.

805
01:09:29,009 --> 01:09:30,761
So different from today.

806
01:09:31,829 --> 01:09:35,041
Our numbers dwindling, hunted and alone,

807
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,265
we are hopelessly misunderstood,

808
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:42,475
but you two seem to have beaten the odds.

809
01:09:44,332 --> 01:09:46,843
I'm very, very happy for you.

810
01:09:50,923 --> 01:09:52,826
The ship hasn't been used in years.

811
01:09:53,315 --> 01:09:57,736
I've no idea if it will fly safely, but I'm
sure that's a risk you're prepared to take.

812
01:09:59,952 --> 01:10:01,240
We're very grateful.

813
01:10:02,045 --> 01:10:04,553
I only wish I could go with you.

814
01:10:11,514 --> 01:10:13,134
You look so beautiful.

815
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:44,003
Mmm.

816
01:10:44,992 --> 01:10:45,798
Why stop?

817
01:10:46,186 --> 01:10:48,823
I want you, Meier. I want all of you.

818
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:54,085
Why not?

819
01:10:54,793 --> 01:10:57,554
You don't know what it's like, Charlotte,

820
01:10:57,821 --> 01:11:01,057
to live forever in darkness eternal,

821
01:11:01,475 --> 01:11:05,870
forever thirsting for blood despite your best intention.

822
01:11:06,525 --> 01:11:10,225
I can't imagine that life for you. Not for you, Charlotte.

823
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,280
You're so selfish, Meier.

824
01:11:14,948 --> 01:11:17,534
I carry a heavy weight on my conscience...

825
01:11:18,909 --> 01:11:24,197
Those villagers and the bounty hunter and
my family, they still mourn my loss, Meier.

826
01:11:24,867 --> 01:11:27,089
It wasn't your doing, Charlotte.

827
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:29,486
It was my fault entirely.

828
01:11:30,287 --> 01:11:34,917
Well, then we're both to blame, because
we can't know happiness, not anymore.

829
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:40,130
I wanted you to be happy, Meier, and so I
abandoned my father and my brother for you.

830
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:45,302
But their pain set the wheels in motion
for our pain, and so on and on it goes.

831
01:11:48,247 --> 01:11:51,650
All we have is each other now,
and I want to be close to you.

832
01:11:52,706 --> 01:11:54,311
Without that, we have nothing.

833
01:11:58,992 --> 01:12:02,699
All the pain I've caused and all
the agony I feel is nothing now.

834
01:12:03,257 --> 01:12:05,709
And you are everything to me, my love.

835
01:12:15,784 --> 01:12:19,501
We'll talk more on our trip to the
stars, if that's all right with you.

836
01:12:23,592 --> 01:12:26,909
There is some unfinished business I have to attend to.

837
01:12:28,372 --> 01:12:30,519
Do not leave this room. Understand?

838
01:13:09,624 --> 01:13:10,208
D.

839
01:13:22,107 --> 01:13:25,641
Listen, Meier. The woman says she wants to go back home.

840
01:13:34,579 --> 01:13:36,849
I don't believe it.

841
01:13:59,654 --> 01:14:00,954
Charlotte.

842
01:14:13,084 --> 01:14:16,773
I don't know. Something's not right.

843
01:14:17,764 --> 01:14:21,174
Of course, you don't have to take my word for it.

844
01:14:22,709 --> 01:14:24,795
You can judge for yourself.

845
01:14:56,439 --> 01:14:57,336
Let's go.

846
01:15:00,482 --> 01:15:02,165
Leila. Don't go.

847
01:15:03,213 --> 01:15:05,358
Leila, don't go in there.

848
01:15:05,529 --> 01:15:08,226
If you go in there, you're never coming back.

849
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:10,394
Oh, I'm coming back.

850
01:15:12,582 --> 01:15:13,082
No!

851
01:15:31,111 --> 01:15:32,642
Leila, check upstairs.

852
01:15:32,658 --> 01:15:33,594
I'm on it.

853
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:41,523
Nice hat.

854
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:30,389
I know you hate me, D.

855
01:16:31,007 --> 01:16:33,152
Please try and understand.

856
01:16:33,749 --> 01:16:35,336
I loved your father.

857
01:16:36,171 --> 01:16:37,672
What choice did I have?

858
01:16:40,905 --> 01:16:41,473
Huh?!

859
01:16:53,735 --> 01:16:54,277
Ahh!

860
01:17:02,236 --> 01:17:05,132
Nolt! Kyle! Hey!

861
01:17:05,706 --> 01:17:06,886
I don't believe it.

862
01:17:07,116 --> 01:17:09,994
You two sure are a sight for sore eyes.

863
01:17:11,821 --> 01:17:12,605
Ugh!

864
01:17:37,428 --> 01:17:39,507
What are you doing? Get up.

865
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:42,064
Why aren't you listening?

866
01:17:42,242 --> 01:17:43,271
I said get up.

867
01:17:45,481 --> 01:17:49,443
Go away. I wanna be alone.

868
01:17:52,162 --> 01:17:53,391
Get out of here!

869
01:18:03,972 --> 01:18:05,502
Can you forgive me, D?

870
01:18:07,335 --> 01:18:07,809
D?

871
01:18:08,935 --> 01:18:10,918
I know it's been lonely for you.

872
01:18:12,399 --> 01:18:13,761
I was lonely, too,

873
01:18:14,518 --> 01:18:16,145
until you came along.

874
01:18:17,152 --> 01:18:18,925
Did you hear, D?

875
01:18:29,372 --> 01:18:30,631
It's OK, honey.

876
01:18:31,282 --> 01:18:32,456
It's OK to cry.

877
01:18:33,066 --> 01:18:35,046
I know. I know how you feel.

878
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:38,534
It wasn't your fault.

879
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:39,558
It wasn't.

880
01:18:40,566 --> 01:18:41,882
Yes, it was!

881
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:43,970
Let go!

882
01:18:46,931 --> 01:18:47,665
Wait!

883
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:48,699
Ugh.

884
01:18:55,567 --> 01:18:56,772
It's just an illusion.

885
01:18:57,423 --> 01:18:59,018
Carmila's playing with us.

886
01:19:01,932 --> 01:19:03,767
Excellent. What fun.

887
01:19:05,295 --> 01:19:07,636
I haven't had this much fun in centuries.

888
01:19:07,761 --> 01:19:12,031
You don't mind, do you? It just
makes things so much more interesting.

889
01:19:12,935 --> 01:19:16,019
You're doing very well, by the way, very well, indeed.

890
01:19:17,106 --> 01:19:19,299
The woman. Where are you hiding her?

891
01:19:30,909 --> 01:19:33,972
Borgoff, what are you doing? We don't have time for this.

892
01:19:34,464 --> 01:19:37,174
Leila, are you in love with this dunpeal?

893
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:39,476
Are you crazy? What is wrong with you?

894
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:42,479
Borgoff!

895
01:19:48,812 --> 01:19:51,619
Dunpeal, drop your weapon.

896
01:20:02,743 --> 01:20:04,733
Drop it now! Grrr!

897
01:20:04,794 --> 01:20:06,068
She took you in, didn't she?

898
01:20:08,054 --> 01:20:10,214
Grr! She'll die!

899
01:20:10,451 --> 01:20:12,215
I'm warning you, dunpeal.

900
01:20:12,231 --> 01:20:13,827
Don't come any closer.

901
01:20:16,664 --> 01:20:18,874
Enough! Now you die!

902
01:20:18,898 --> 01:20:20,108
Aaah!

903
01:20:22,032 --> 01:20:23,537
No!

904
01:20:26,723 --> 01:20:28,151
Aaaah!

905
01:20:28,294 --> 01:20:28,990
Grove!

906
01:20:30,012 --> 01:20:31,458
Grove! No!

907
01:20:35,645 --> 01:20:37,939
Lei... la...

908
01:21:40,605 --> 01:21:42,396
Look! She's coming!

909
01:21:42,745 --> 01:21:43,913
Carmila!

910
01:21:48,724 --> 01:21:50,848
The spirit of Carmila!

911
01:22:26,094 --> 01:22:28,028
Dunpeal hunter.

912
01:22:28,514 --> 01:22:34,144
Your mother was human, but your father was a
vampire, and you have betrayed his ancient blood!

913
01:22:34,657 --> 01:22:37,156
You side with humans against us!

914
01:22:40,156 --> 01:22:45,202
Our people are facing extinction,
and you're contributing to their demise.

915
01:22:45,674 --> 01:22:49,572
You stalk and kill your own ancestors, dunpeal.

916
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:55,118
You should be ashamed!

917
01:22:56,306 --> 01:22:58,808
Your human self is your weaker self.

918
01:22:58,808 --> 01:23:02,959
Humans are nothing more than livestock.
We prey on them as they prey on beasts.

919
01:23:02,975 --> 01:23:04,953
This is the rule of nature!

920
01:23:17,752 --> 01:23:20,301
Your time is coming to an end.

921
01:23:20,317 --> 01:23:22,716
Your kind must face extinction.

922
01:23:23,034 --> 01:23:25,854
You cannot survive. You must die.

923
01:23:25,934 --> 01:23:28,156
That is the rule of nature.

924
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:31,834
Ah. Very strong words for a dunpeal,

925
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:33,773
but you seem to forget

926
01:23:34,093 --> 01:23:37,547
our spirits are eternal.

927
01:23:38,115 --> 01:23:39,700
No, Carmila.

928
01:23:39,724 --> 01:23:41,726
Nothing lasts forever.

929
01:23:44,187 --> 01:23:44,921
I see.

930
01:23:45,998 --> 01:23:49,609
I should have known better than to
reason with your kind, dunpeal hunter.

931
01:23:49,813 --> 01:23:52,588
I guess my only option is to use force.

932
01:23:53,411 --> 01:23:54,557
Aaaah!

933
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:28,022
Aaah!

934
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:33,217
No! This can't happen!

935
01:24:45,603 --> 01:24:46,920
Aaaah!

936
01:24:50,198 --> 01:24:53,877
Aaaah!

937
01:24:58,097 --> 01:25:01,068
Are you the son of the Vampire King?

938
01:25:01,290 --> 01:25:02,499
Who are you?

939
01:25:02,515 --> 01:25:04,554
Who are you, dunpeal?

940
01:25:09,107 --> 01:25:10,885
Such power.

941
01:25:40,362 --> 01:25:43,886
Charlotte, come back. I need you. Please come back.

942
01:25:48,930 --> 01:25:51,158
Mmm. Ohh.

943
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,735
Darling, is that you?

944
01:25:56,335 --> 01:25:58,639
Oh, yes. It's me, Meier.

945
01:25:59,356 --> 01:26:00,801
I'm so happy, Meier,

946
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:04,518
because we are together now, at last.

947
01:26:04,779 --> 01:26:06,916
Together at last.

948
01:26:09,343 --> 01:26:11,020
You made me happy, Meier.

949
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:12,837
You let me dream.

950
01:26:13,013 --> 01:26:16,672
You let me dream of our beautiful trip to the stars.

951
01:26:16,839 --> 01:26:17,808
Our dream.

952
01:26:18,705 --> 01:26:21,653
Our beautiful, wonderful dream.

953
01:26:21,864 --> 01:26:22,984
It's not a dream.

954
01:26:23,596 --> 01:26:25,771
We are going to those stars, Charlotte.

955
01:26:26,428 --> 01:26:28,185
Oh, my dear one.

956
01:26:29,982 --> 01:26:32,022
You and I will get away from here.

957
01:26:32,325 --> 01:26:37,337
We will fly together to the City of the Night
where we were meant to be free from all of this.

958
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:40,363
Where you can rest, my love, finally, and be free.

959
01:26:40,822 --> 01:26:41,697
Yes.

960
01:26:42,553 --> 01:26:45,431
Freedom... at last.

961
01:26:58,627 --> 01:27:01,594
My precious, precious love.

962
01:27:07,902 --> 01:27:08,736
Let's go...

963
01:27:09,467 --> 01:27:10,927
Away from here.

964
01:27:19,961 --> 01:27:21,539
Stop right there, Meier.

965
01:27:23,407 --> 01:27:27,089
I'm taking her back, back to her family, who loved her.

966
01:27:33,499 --> 01:27:36,328
She knew I loved her best of all.

967
01:27:37,053 --> 01:27:40,923
You can't understand it. You've never loved a human.

968
01:27:41,235 --> 01:27:43,028
I've never killed one, either.

969
01:27:44,577 --> 01:27:49,494
You struggle to resist this nature
of ours, but it can't last forever, D.

970
01:27:50,529 --> 01:27:53,172
The urge for their blood is stronger.

971
01:27:53,507 --> 01:27:56,302
If that day comes, then another will hunt me.

972
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:57,963
It's as simple as that.

973
01:28:01,652 --> 01:28:02,403
Raaaahhh!

974
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:35,572
What a waste, a sad waste.

975
01:29:08,928 --> 01:29:10,616
Enough of killing.

976
01:29:10,824 --> 01:29:13,395
Enough of misery and death.

977
01:29:14,936 --> 01:29:16,437
I've had enough.

978
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:38,708
I've had enough.

979
01:29:39,831 --> 01:29:40,480
Uhh!

980
01:30:05,363 --> 01:30:06,308
Why...

981
01:30:07,642 --> 01:30:08,761
did you miss

982
01:30:10,068 --> 01:30:11,731
my heart?

983
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:27,052
She's dead.

984
01:30:27,603 --> 01:30:29,521
The ring is all I need.

985
01:30:30,112 --> 01:30:33,715
I'll take it to her father as proof.

986
01:31:47,475 --> 01:31:50,353
Mind giving me a ride just as far as the next town?

987
01:31:50,872 --> 01:31:52,015
I'd appreciate it.

988
01:31:56,648 --> 01:31:59,329
That reward money would rightfully be mine, you know.

989
01:31:59,818 --> 01:32:01,433
But, hey, I'm generous.

990
01:32:01,928 --> 01:32:04,150
I'll let you keep it just this one time.

991
01:32:38,646 --> 01:32:40,138
Where is he taking her?

992
01:32:44,656 --> 01:32:45,688
Away from here.

993
01:32:47,446 --> 01:32:48,444
Away.

994
01:32:56,113 --> 01:32:57,823
Fly. Come on!

995
01:33:04,788 --> 01:33:05,984
You can make it.

996
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:08,667
Come on!

997
01:33:13,339 --> 01:33:14,449
Fly away...

998
01:34:07,476 --> 01:34:12,546
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in this
resting place to bid farewell to our sister.

999
01:34:13,524 --> 01:34:16,277
Into your gentle arms we commend her gracious spirit.

1000
01:34:18,797 --> 01:34:22,348
Take her to yourself and give her safe haven,

1001
01:34:23,385 --> 01:34:25,169
andthough she struggled in life,

1002
01:34:25,403 --> 01:34:28,037
now she knows your blessed peace.

1003
01:34:29,106 --> 01:34:31,692
For all who question will find answers,

1004
01:34:32,293 --> 01:34:33,419
and all who love

1005
01:34:33,686 --> 01:34:38,294
will find contentment, joy, and peace eternal.

1006
01:34:39,393 --> 01:34:42,145
For now we see as through a glass darkly,

1007
01:34:43,171 --> 01:34:46,466
but then we shall see clearly, face to face.

1008
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:53,480
Mister.

1009
01:34:54,606 --> 01:34:55,232
Wait!

1010
01:34:56,942 --> 01:34:58,351
Mister, wait!

1011
01:34:58,631 --> 01:34:59,226
Um,

1012
01:35:00,131 --> 01:35:05,437
excuse me, sir, but I was wondering
if you knew my grandmother Leila.

1013
01:35:10,668 --> 01:35:13,056
Yes, it's you, isn't it?

1014
01:35:13,401 --> 01:35:15,361
My grandmother told me about you.

1015
01:35:15,377 --> 01:35:20,049
So, I'd be honored if you'd come to
our house. My dad would be so happy.

1016
01:35:20,674 --> 01:35:21,383
Please?

1017
01:35:23,177 --> 01:35:25,054
I appreciate your kindness.

1018
01:35:25,387 --> 01:35:28,310
Oh, come on. We don't live very far.

1019
01:35:32,243 --> 01:35:35,814
I just came here to keep a
promise to an old friend of mine.

1020
01:35:37,508 --> 01:35:40,511
She was afraid no one would mourn her death.

1021
01:35:40,818 --> 01:35:42,539
I'm glad she was so wrong.

1022
01:35:42,946 --> 01:35:43,530
Huh?

1023
01:35:43,882 --> 01:35:44,533
Oh.

1024
01:35:44,859 --> 01:35:46,116
I guess I see.

1025
01:35:50,579 --> 01:35:53,149
Anyway, thank you for coming, sir.

1026
01:36:03,384 --> 01:36:04,259
Good-bye.

1027
01:36:07,012 --> 01:36:07,763
GOOd-bye!

1028
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:13,547
Well, that was nice.

1029
01:36:14,144 --> 01:36:16,191
You're not so bad after all.

1030
01:36:17,898 --> 01:36:19,401
You just dress bad.
