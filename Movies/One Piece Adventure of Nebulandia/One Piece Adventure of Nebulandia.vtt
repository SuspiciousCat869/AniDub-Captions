Aww, crap!

[KOMEI]
I have a plan!

00:00:44.846 --> 00:00:46.814 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KOMEI] One that will
bring about the death

00:00:46.848 --> 00:00:49.116 position:21% line:89% align:start
of Straw Hat Luffy.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.519 position:30% line:83% align:start
As well as put
a long-overdue end

00:00:51.553 --> 00:00:54.756 position:30% line:83% align:start
to the entire
Straw Hat crew!

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.257 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's likely not
a soldier among you who has

00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:59.761 position:16% line:83% align:start
forgotten the day these
pirates went on a rampage

00:00:59.794 --> 00:01:01.596 position:13% line:89% align:start
through Navy Headquarters.

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.632 position:21% line:83% align:start
That act of anarchy
is a textbook example

00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.801 position:16% line:89% align:start
of the Great Pirate Era.

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:09.837 position:16% line:83% align:start
With this presentation,
I ask you to once again

00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:13.440 position:21% line:83% align:start
ingrain the faces of
the enemy into your minds.

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:16.711 position:27% line:83% align:start
The swordsman,

and King of the Snipers,
Sniper King!

[USOPP]
Whoa! Easy! You startled me!

00:01:38.332 --> 00:01:40.334 position:10% line:83% align:start
That was weird. I felt like
I was being laughed at.

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:45.172 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KOMEI] The archeologist,
"Demon Child" Nico Robin!

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:49.176 position:5% line:89% align:start
The shipwright, "Cyborg" Franky!

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:52.714 position:30% line:83% align:start
The musician,
"Humming Swordsman" Brook!

Lastly, an outlaw
as well as the grandson

00:02:01.188 --> 00:02:06.828 position:10% line:83% align:start
of Vice Admiral Garp and son
of Dragon the Revolutionary.

00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:10.832 position:5% line:89% align:start
The captain... Straw Hat Luffy!

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:15.703 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KOMEI] These nine are
the enemies of the Navy!

00:02:15.737 --> 00:02:17.337 position:30% line:89% align:start
I have a plan.

00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:18.706 position:27% line:89% align:start
One that I call:

00:02:23.578 --> 00:02:25.278 position:38% line:5% align:start
[KOMEI]
Let it commence!

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:26.781 position:35% line:83% align:start
[MARINES]
Yes, sir!

[LUFFY]
Sanji, I'm hungry!

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:37.859 position:16% line:83% align:start
What's taking so long?
I'm super starving over here!

00:02:37.892 --> 00:02:40.427 position:16% line:89% align:start
Meat! Meat! No veggies!

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.863 position:30% line:89% align:start
[SANJI grunts]

00:02:41.896 --> 00:02:43.497 position:27% line:83% align:start
You are the most
annoying thing ever!

00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:44.799 position:21% line:89% align:start
Just wait a minute!

00:02:44.832 --> 00:02:46.333 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hungry, hungry, hungry!

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:48.235 position:30% line:89% align:start
Now, now, now!

00:02:56.443 --> 00:02:59.246 position:33% line:83% align:start
I found one!
I found a coconut!

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:00.682 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
Ooh? For real?

00:03:00.715 --> 00:03:02.382 position:21% line:89% align:start
Let me take a look.

00:03:02.884 --> 00:03:05.318 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
Whoa! Good eye!

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:07.955 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yes, quite impressive!
It's rather far away!

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.222 position:16% line:89% align:start
[FRANKY, USOPP chuckle]

[FRANKY gasping]

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.868 position:38% line:83% align:start
[BROOK]
And this round goes to Usopp!

00:03:20.902 --> 00:03:21.969 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes!

00:03:22.003 --> 00:03:24.371 position:35% line:83% align:start
Damn you!
I'll beat ya next time!

00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:25.673 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
If you say so!

00:03:25.707 --> 00:03:28.843 position:21% line:89% align:start
Ugh, you're kidding.

00:03:28.876 --> 00:03:30.277 position:21% line:89% align:start
Pleasure as always!

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.847 position:27% line:83% align:start
Come on, Franky!
That's three times in a row now!

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.981 position:38% line:83% align:start
[FRANKY]
Shut up!

00:03:34.015 --> 00:03:37.284 position:16% line:83% align:start
[USOPP] Who gave you two
permission to bet on us, anyway?

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:39.286 position:24% line:83% align:start
Whoa! Now there's
an empty bottle!

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.288 position:24% line:83% align:start
Awesome! I'll sink
that one, too!

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:42.990 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's what you think, brother!

00:03:43.024 --> 00:03:45.292 position:19% line:83% align:start
[USOPP] Where's this
soon-to-be-broken bottle?

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:46.393 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CHOPPER]
It's in the same direction

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:48.295 position:7% line:89% align:start
as that weird looking island.

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:49.831 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wait a second!

00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:50.732 position:24% line:89% align:start
Huh? What's wrong?

00:03:50.765 --> 00:03:54.035 position:16% line:83% align:start
I see a blinking light.
A signal, maybe?

00:03:54.068 --> 00:03:55.636 position:10% line:89% align:start
What's the commotion about?

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.705 position:21% line:89% align:start
Some signal thingy.

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.408 position:10% line:89% align:start
I see it now. That's an SOS!

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:02.877 position:21% line:89% align:start
Wait. What'd he say?

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.614 position:19% line:83% align:start
It seems the boys have
spotted a distress signal.

00:04:06.647 --> 00:04:08.315 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CHOPPER]
What's with that island?

00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:10.918 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's covered in giant mushrooms!

00:04:10.952 --> 00:04:12.620 position:27% line:83% align:start
That means more
mushrooms to eat.

00:04:12.653 --> 00:04:14.021 position:16% line:89% align:start
Where'd you come from?!

00:04:14.055 --> 00:04:16.456 position:21% line:83% align:start
So there's somebody
stranded over there?

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:17.925 position:35% line:89% align:start
Who is it?

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.560 position:21% line:89% align:start
Let me take a look.

00:04:19.594 --> 00:04:20.628 position:27% line:89% align:start
There's a ship.

00:04:20.661 --> 00:04:23.531 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, looks like it's marooned.

00:04:23.564 --> 00:04:27.769 position:5% line:83% align:start
A crowd of people on the beach.
I think they're all women. Huh?

00:04:27.802 --> 00:04:29.302 position:41% line:89% align:start
Women!

00:04:29.336 --> 00:04:32.006 position:10% line:89% align:start
Aww, Sanji! Where's my meat?

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.441 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
Here.

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:35.576 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
Back to more important things.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.677 position:24% line:89% align:start
What should we do?

00:04:36.711 --> 00:04:39.346 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SANJI] What any decent
person would do, of course.

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:41.983 position:16% line:83% align:start
When someone is in need,
you help them. End of story.

00:04:42.016 --> 00:04:43.818 position:5% line:83% align:start
[CHOPPER] Got a little something
under your nose there, Sanji.

00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:46.087 position:13% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] So, you guys wanna
stop by that island, then?

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.689 position:10% line:83% align:start
[FRANKY] I'd say the cook's
not giving us much choice.

[NAMI]
Hey, hold on a second!

00:04:50.357 --> 00:04:51.458 position:27% line:83% align:start
[FRANKY, LUFFY]
Huh?

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:53.426 position:13% line:83% align:start
You shouldn't just decide
things without asking us!

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.929 position:21% line:83% align:start
What if this messes
with the log pose?

00:04:54.962 --> 00:04:56.564 position:35% line:83% align:start
[FRANKY]
I can repair that ship so fast,

00:04:56.597 --> 00:04:59.100 position:5% line:83% align:start
the log pose won't even notice.
It'll be fine!

00:04:59.133 --> 00:05:00.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
[NAMI] All right.
I guess it's no big deal, then.

00:05:01.002 --> 00:05:02.804 position:24% line:83% align:start
Just make sure to
charge them for the repair.

00:05:02.837 --> 00:05:04.337 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
You are so heartless.

00:05:04.371 --> 00:05:06.941 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
That's the Nami I know and love!

00:05:06.974 --> 00:05:09.076 position:19% line:83% align:start
[ROBIN] Well, Captain?
Should we help them out?

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.445 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah, sure! Besides,
that island looks delicious.

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.651 position:16% line:83% align:start
Let's go! Starboard helm
at full speed, Nami!

00:05:16.684 --> 00:05:17.785 position:19% line:89% align:start
All right, all right.

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:18.953 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
Don't worry, ladies!

00:05:18.986 --> 00:05:23.356 position:10% line:83% align:start
Your knight in shining armor
is coming to save the day!

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.059 position:21% line:83% align:start
[FRANKY] I'm the one
who's gonna do all the work!

00:05:25.092 --> 00:05:27.762 position:19% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] I hope I can
eat a bunch of mushrooms.

00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:37.872 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CHOPPER]
This place is beautiful!

00:05:37.905 --> 00:05:40.074 position:19% line:83% align:start
[ROBIN] It looks like
it's normally uninhabited.

00:05:40.107 --> 00:05:42.877 position:7% line:89% align:start
Nature remains untouched here.

Hey! Is everybody okay?

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:55.455 position:38% line:83% align:start

We saw your distress signal!

00:05:55.488 --> 00:05:56.290 position:35% line:83% align:start
[FRANKY]
I'm a shipwright!

00:05:56.324 --> 00:05:58.659 position:30% line:83% align:start
I can repair
everything, no problem!

00:05:58.693 --> 00:06:00.427 position:27% line:89% align:start
Just hang tight!

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.531 position:21% line:83% align:start
Look at the size of
this yummy mushroom!

00:06:03.564 --> 00:06:04.632 position:24% line:89% align:start
Whoa, whoa, Luffy.

00:06:04.665 --> 00:06:07.735 position:13% line:83% align:start
Wait. Let me find out if
it's edible or not, okay?

00:06:07.768 --> 00:06:09.937 position:21% line:83% align:start
But I'm practically
immune to poison!

00:06:09.971 --> 00:06:11.138 position:16% line:89% align:start
Would you listen to me?!

00:06:11.172 --> 00:06:14.008 position:10% line:83% align:start
There are some poisons that
cause changes to your body,

00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:15.843 position:24% line:89% align:start
so just back off!

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.882 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't blame you.
After all, I am a genius.

00:12:28.916 --> 00:12:30.884 position:16% line:89% align:start
But wait, there's more!

00:12:30.918 --> 00:12:33.487 position:5% line:83% align:start
Meet our new military tactician
who devised the plan

00:12:33.521 --> 00:12:35.523 position:27% line:89% align:start
to lure you in!

00:12:35.557 --> 00:12:38.058 position:13% line:89% align:start
He's a devious strategist.

00:12:53.907 --> 00:12:58.345 position:5% line:83% align:start
The infamous Straw Hat Pirates!
Truly a pleasure!

00:12:58.379 --> 00:13:01.949 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm Komei of the Foxy Pirates!

00:13:01.982 --> 00:13:04.184 position:27% line:89% align:start
[KOMEI cackles]

00:13:06.153 --> 00:13:08.822 position:30% line:83% align:start
People call me
"White Feather" Komei.

00:13:08.856 --> 00:13:11.091 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's nice to make
your acquaintance.

00:13:11.125 --> 00:13:14.094 position:19% line:83% align:start
He doesn't look like
a military tactician to me.

00:13:14.128 --> 00:13:15.963 position:5% line:89% align:start
But with that weird personality,

00:13:15.996 --> 00:13:19.066 position:19% line:83% align:start
he fits right in with
the rest of Foxy's crew.

00:13:19.099 --> 00:13:21.135 position:13% line:89% align:start
You may not believe this,

00:13:21.168 --> 00:13:23.404 position:24% line:83% align:start
but Komei used to
be in the Navy.

00:13:23.437 --> 00:13:25.005 position:41% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:13:25.039 --> 00:13:25.839 position:35% line:89% align:start
The Navy?

00:13:25.873 --> 00:13:27.408 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
Come on, that's ridiculous!

00:13:27.441 --> 00:13:29.511 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why would a Navy man
become a pirate?

00:13:29.544 --> 00:13:32.846 position:7% line:83% align:start
[FOXY] Because I defeated him
in a Davy Back Fight!

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.516 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
Look, the Navy wouldn't--

00:13:34.549 --> 00:13:37.351 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KOMEI] Rules are rules!
They're meant to be followed!

00:13:37.384 --> 00:13:39.286 position:5% line:89% align:start
I may have worn a Navy uniform,

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.156 position:13% line:83% align:start
but I'm first and foremost
a man of the sea.

00:13:42.189 --> 00:13:44.491 position:21% line:83% align:start
When you agree to a
Davy Back Fight and lose,

00:13:44.526 --> 00:13:47.629 position:7% line:83% align:start
you must join the winning crew
with no fuss and no regrets.

00:13:47.662 --> 00:13:51.965 position:21% line:89% align:start
[FOXY PIRATES cheer]

He says that like he's proud.
What a jackass.

00:13:55.135 --> 00:13:56.970 position:19% line:83% align:start
There are plenty more
new crew members

where these two came
from waiting to meet you!

00:13:59.239 --> 00:14:00.642 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now there's only
one reason why

00:14:00.675 --> 00:14:02.376 position:27% line:83% align:start
I would lure you
Straw Hats here.

00:14:02.409 --> 00:14:04.244 position:7% line:89% align:start
And can you guess what it is?

00:14:04.278 --> 00:14:06.648 position:7% line:89% align:start
For a Davy Back Fight rematch!

00:14:06.681 --> 00:14:09.551 position:19% line:83% align:start
I assume you'll accept
this challenge?

[ZORO]
Sorry, but that's impossible.

00:14:28.068 --> 00:14:29.002 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:29.036 --> 00:14:31.071 position:16% line:83% align:start
[ZORO] A man isn't a man
if he turns his back

Ugh! Kill me!

anyway?

Never heard of it?

00:15:39.239 --> 00:15:41.208 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's a contest between
two pirate crews

00:15:41.241 --> 00:15:43.243 position:30% line:83% align:start
that goes back
hundreds of years.

Well, yeah.

00:15:57.826 --> 00:15:59.761 position:10% line:83% align:start
I guess that means you took
someone from their crew?

No we took their Jolly Roger.

00:16:41.201 --> 00:16:43.370 position:21% line:83% align:start
Okay! It's time for
both crews to pledge

00:16:43.403 --> 00:16:45.773 position:13% line:83% align:start
to follow the three rules
about losing!

00:16:45.807 --> 00:16:47.742 position:5% line:89% align:start
First rule: There's only one way

00:16:47.775 --> 00:16:50.812 position:5% line:83% align:start
that you can take back anything
you lose in a Davy Back Fight.

00:16:50.845 --> 00:16:54.516 position:5% line:83% align:start
And that, of course, is through
another Davy Back Fight.

00:16:54.549 --> 00:16:57.050 position:21% line:83% align:start
Second rule: anyone
taken by the winner

00:16:57.084 --> 00:16:59.286 position:21% line:83% align:start
must swear loyalty
to that ship's captain.

00:16:59.319 --> 00:17:01.756 position:21% line:83% align:start
Third rule: if your
Jolly Roger is taken,

00:17:01.789 --> 00:17:04.592 position:16% line:83% align:start
you can never sail under
that sign again!

00:17:04.626 --> 00:17:06.193 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you break any
of these rules,

00:17:06.226 --> 00:17:07.795 position:21% line:83% align:start
you'll be considered
dishonorable pirates

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:12.065 position:7% line:83% align:start
and sent down to Davy Jones's
Locker at the bottom of the sea!

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:13.635 position:27% line:89% align:start
Everybody swear!

00:17:13.668 --> 00:17:14.836 position:38% line:89% align:start
I swear.

the Three Coin Game!

00:17:19.807 --> 00:17:21.743 position:13% line:89% align:start
Standard rules, of course.

00:17:21.776 --> 00:17:23.811 position:33% line:89% align:start
Here we go!

00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:28.315 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yes! And with that,
it's under way!

00:17:28.348 --> 00:17:30.752 position:19% line:83% align:start
Foxy's revenge match
against the Straw Hats!

Let the Davy Back Fight begin!

00:17:32.887 --> 00:17:36.156 position:16% line:83% align:start

920 straight victories
to the Straw Hats.

00:17:38.826 --> 00:17:41.295 position:21% line:83% align:start
However, after that,
he was winning

00:17:41.328 --> 00:17:42.296 position:21% line:89% align:start
battle after battle!

00:17:42.329 --> 00:17:45.465 position:19% line:83% align:start

a good match once again!

00:17:45.499 --> 00:17:48.201 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now, the much-anticipated
first round!

00:17:48.235 --> 00:17:50.203 position:21% line:89% align:start
The eating contest!

00:17:50.237 --> 00:17:53.273 position:7% line:83% align:start
Interestingly enough, the food
for this contest is mushrooms

00:17:53.307 --> 00:17:54.776 position:5% line:89% align:start
harvested from this very island!

00:17:54.809 --> 00:17:58.178 position:13% line:83% align:start
Lucky me! I wish I was in
an eating contest every day!

00:17:58.211 --> 00:18:00.882 position:16% line:83% align:start
Never seen these before.
I wonder if they're okay to eat.

00:18:00.915 --> 00:18:01.716 position:24% line:89% align:start
For me, they are.

00:18:01.749 --> 00:18:04.184 position:21% line:83% align:start
Poisons don't really
hurt me anymore.

00:18:04.217 --> 00:18:06.420 position:16% line:83% align:start

once they're inside you?

[CHOPPER]
Don't eat them!

00:18:07.321 --> 00:18:09.389 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can't find that
mushroom anywhere!

00:18:09.423 --> 00:18:11.626 position:19% line:83% align:start
How do we know those
things are safe to eat?

00:18:11.659 --> 00:18:13.628 position:19% line:83% align:start
I assure you they are.
Tell them.

00:18:13.661 --> 00:18:15.863 position:7% line:83% align:start
They're a recently discovered
new type of mushroom

00:18:15.897 --> 00:18:17.031 position:19% line:89% align:start
not found in any book.

00:18:17.065 --> 00:18:20.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
But they are not poisonous.
There's no need to worry.

Hey, Nami! If I win,
will you show me your--?

00:18:34.949 --> 00:18:36.751 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
No! You will never see them!

The genius shipwright, Dojaku!

[DOJAKU laughing]

00:18:48.261 --> 00:18:49.931 position:7% line:83% align:start
[ITOMIMIZU] And the only girl
competing in this round,

00:18:49.964 --> 00:18:52.165 position:24% line:89% align:start
our idol, Porche!

00:18:52.199 --> 00:18:54.702 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hello! Thank you
for your support!

[FOXY PIRATES cheer]

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:59.473 position:10% line:83% align:start
[ITOMIMIZU] Now I'll explain
the rules of this round.

00:18:59.507 --> 00:19:00.875 position:19% line:89% align:start
They're quite simple.

00:19:00.908 --> 00:19:03.645 position:16% line:83% align:start
Whichever team eats the
most mushrooms, wins!

00:19:03.678 --> 00:19:06.346 position:16% line:83% align:start
The time limit for this
contest is three minutes.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.182 position:10% line:83% align:start
Through careful measurement,
we've checked and double-checked

00:19:09.216 --> 00:19:11.218 position:24% line:83% align:start
that each team has
the same amount.

00:19:11.251 --> 00:19:13.420 position:16% line:83% align:start
You sure you can handle
an eating contest?

00:19:13.453 --> 00:19:16.524 position:10% line:83% align:start
Totally! I may not look it,
but I'm a big eater.

00:19:16.557 --> 00:19:19.226 position:13% line:83% align:start
Look at that. They've been
grilled to perfection.

00:19:19.259 --> 00:19:21.461 position:19% line:83% align:start
Honestly, I could eat
all of these on my own!

00:19:21.495 --> 00:19:24.632 position:19% line:83% align:start
[laughs] You can count
on me, Captain!

00:19:24.666 --> 00:19:25.733 position:16% line:89% align:start
I've quite the appetite.

00:19:25.767 --> 00:19:28.936 position:16% line:83% align:start
And my stomach is quite
literally a bottomless pit!

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:31.839 position:13% line:83% align:start
Having said that, I don't
really have a stomach!

00:19:31.873 --> 00:19:33.975 position:24% line:83% align:start
Bet you didn't see
that one coming!

00:19:34.008 --> 00:19:36.744 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HAMBURG]
My, aren't you the funny one?

00:19:36.778 --> 00:19:38.478 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KOMEI]
Objection!

00:19:38.513 --> 00:19:39.647 position:21% line:89% align:start
What's the problem?

00:19:39.681 --> 00:19:43.250 position:10% line:83% align:start
The Straw Hat's contestants
have an unfair advantage.

00:19:43.283 --> 00:19:46.420 position:7% line:83% align:start
What's that? You got a problem
with our lineup, ex-Navy man?

00:19:46.453 --> 00:19:48.288 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KOMEI]
That's right, I do!

00:19:48.321 --> 00:19:49.791 position:7% line:89% align:start
Since it's an eating contest,

00:19:49.824 --> 00:19:51.993 position:21% line:83% align:start
all those competing
must have a stomach!

00:19:52.026 --> 00:19:53.127 position:35% line:89% align:start
Therefore,

00:19:53.161 --> 00:19:56.631 position:7% line:83% align:start
I feel I must blow the whistle
on Brook, the musician.

00:19:56.664 --> 00:19:58.700 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh! You're right!

00:19:59.701 --> 00:20:01.569 position:13% line:83% align:start
[STRAW HATS] Yeah, that's
a really good point!

00:20:01.602 --> 00:20:03.571 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wait! Are you actually
agreeing with him?

00:20:03.604 --> 00:20:05.472 position:19% line:83% align:start
That means we'll have
a two-man team!

00:20:05.506 --> 00:20:07.307 position:21% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] I told you,
I can do this on my own!

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.811 position:10% line:83% align:start
Idiot! Anything could happen
in a Davy Back Fight!

00:20:09.844 --> 00:20:11.913 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't you remember
what went down last time?

00:20:11.946 --> 00:20:14.381 position:19% line:83% align:start
Chopper almost became
part of the Foxy crew!

00:20:14.414 --> 00:20:17.317 position:7% line:83% align:start
This round hasn't started yet!
Listen, we'll accept

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:20.320 position:13% line:83% align:start
his complaint, just let us
sub in a new team member!

00:20:20.353 --> 00:20:22.557 position:10% line:83% align:start
[FOXY] Don't be ridiculous!
"No change allowed

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:24.959 position:19% line:83% align:start
in competitors" is in
the rules, stupid!

00:20:24.992 --> 00:20:26.994 position:24% line:89% align:start
[CHOPPER whimpers]

00:20:27.028 --> 00:20:30.998 position:5% line:83% align:start
That may be true, but it's okay.
Let's allow the substitution.

00:20:31.032 --> 00:20:31.999 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:32.033 --> 00:20:33.601 position:10% line:89% align:start
They accepted the complaint,

00:20:33.634 --> 00:20:36.003 position:27% line:83% align:start
so let's make an
exception to the rule.

00:20:36.037 --> 00:20:37.972 position:7% line:89% align:start
Who will compete in his place?

00:20:38.005 --> 00:20:40.307 position:33% line:83% align:start
What gives?
That's not a good strategy!

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.376 position:13% line:83% align:start
Why is this newbie trying
to go over the boss' head?

I have no idea what the other
games are gonna be like.

00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:50.852 position:5% line:83% align:start
But there's only one of our crew
that can eat anywhere near

00:20:50.885 --> 00:20:51.886 position:24% line:89% align:start
as much as Luffy.

00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:56.958 position:13% line:83% align:start

I don't have any choice.

00:20:56.991 --> 00:20:59.392 position:21% line:83% align:start

thing over with.

Uh-oh.

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:38.766 position:5% line:83% align:start
It seems we neglected to mention
one last rule to this match.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:39.867 position:24% line:89% align:start
The rule is this:

00:21:39.901 --> 00:21:41.536 position:24% line:83% align:start
"No one except for
the competitors

00:21:41.569 --> 00:21:43.470 position:24% line:83% align:start
are allowed to be
up on the stage."

00:21:43.504 --> 00:21:46.107 position:19% line:83% align:start
If any other member of
the crew breaks that rule,

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.475 position:7% line:89% align:start
they must forfeit the match!"

00:21:48.509 --> 00:21:49.777 position:10% line:89% align:start

Can we just start already?

Let's just continue
pulling the cage in.

[DOJAKU]
Roger! You got it!

00:28:57.572 --> 00:28:58.973 position:35% line:89% align:start
No. Luffy!

00:28:59.006 --> 00:29:00.207 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
On it!

00:29:03.545 --> 00:29:06.814 position:27% line:83% align:start
What an idiot.
Even I can't bend those bars!

What kind of freak is he?

00:29:10.217 --> 00:29:12.486 position:19% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] Zoro! Sanji!
Let's get outta here!

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.888 position:41% line:83% align:start
--Hey!
--[CHOPPER] Luffy! Behind you!

[DOJAKU grunting]

00:29:24.098 --> 00:29:26.467 position:27% line:83% align:start
Come on, guys!
Wake up and move!

00:29:27.501 --> 00:29:29.203 position:30% line:89% align:start
[FOXY gasping]

00:29:33.874 --> 00:29:35.376 position:21% line:83% align:start
And now for the next
part of my plan.

00:29:35.409 --> 00:29:38.279 position:16% line:83% align:start
Come out, subordinates!
Reveal yourselves!

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:41.282 position:16% line:89% align:start
Ship-bottom squad here!

00:29:41.315 --> 00:29:43.317 position:27% line:83% align:start
We're all ready
and awaiting orders!

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:47.054 position:24% line:83% align:start
Excellent to hear.
It's time to withdraw!

00:29:55.496 --> 00:29:57.364 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, no! The ship is leaving!

00:29:57.398 --> 00:29:59.833 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're not going anywhere!

00:30:02.002 --> 00:30:03.470 position:24% line:89% align:start
[DOJAKU grunting]

00:30:05.272 --> 00:30:08.142 position:24% line:89% align:start
Gum-Gum Rocket...!

00:30:08.175 --> 00:30:09.109 position:27% line:89% align:start
What happened?!

00:30:09.143 --> 00:30:10.978 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's having trouble
standing in the sand!

[LUFFY]
Damn you!

00:30:12.413 --> 00:30:15.550 position:19% line:89% align:start
Gimme back my friends!

00:30:15.583 --> 00:30:17.619 position:19% line:89% align:start
Ah. Just as expected.

00:30:17.652 --> 00:30:19.453 position:27% line:89% align:start
So predictable.

00:30:21.556 --> 00:30:23.023 position:35% line:89% align:start
[gasping]

00:30:24.958 --> 00:30:29.063 position:13% line:89% align:start
[LUFFY grunting, screams]

00:30:29.096 --> 00:30:29.863 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Luffy!

00:30:29.897 --> 00:30:31.332 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
No! He fell into the sea!

00:30:31.365 --> 00:30:33.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
It deflects pursuers
with a slick coating.

00:30:33.934 --> 00:30:34.435 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's called...

00:30:36.937 --> 00:30:39.907 position:24% line:83% align:start
Come on. You just
poured some oil there.

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:45.145 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Dammit.

00:30:45.179 --> 00:30:47.549 position:41% line:89% align:start
Komei!

00:30:47.582 --> 00:30:49.049 position:21% line:89% align:start
Scream all you want.

00:30:49.083 --> 00:30:52.986 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's nothing you
can do to stop me now.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.322 position:19% line:89% align:start
Listen up, Straw Hats!

00:30:55.356 --> 00:30:56.924 position:13% line:89% align:start
This must be frustrating.

00:30:56.957 --> 00:30:59.561 position:7% line:83% align:start
Wanting to save your friends,
but helpless to do so.

00:30:59.594 --> 00:31:02.062 position:21% line:83% align:start
I won't run or hide
from your pursuit.

00:31:02.096 --> 00:31:03.964 position:19% line:89% align:start
Come out and face me!

00:31:03.997 --> 00:31:04.632 position:41% line:89% align:start
Here!

00:31:04.666 --> 00:31:06.668 position:27% line:89% align:start
[USOPP gasping]

00:31:06.701 --> 00:31:08.636 position:5% line:89% align:start
That looks like an Eternal Pose.

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:12.172 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KOMEI]
I'll be expecting you!

00:31:12.206 --> 00:31:13.974 position:16% line:89% align:start
Don't underestimate me!

00:31:14.007 --> 00:31:16.511 position:21% line:83% align:start
I still have an ace
in the hole, Komei!

00:31:16.544 --> 00:31:19.480 position:27% line:83% align:start
Have a taste of
my Slow-Slow Beam!

00:31:19.514 --> 00:31:21.382 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
It's beam time!

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.955 position:21% line:89% align:start
Huh? What the hell?

00:31:27.988 --> 00:31:29.657 position:30% line:89% align:start
[ALL gasping]

00:31:32.594 --> 00:31:34.928 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KOMEI]
You're also quite predictable.

00:31:34.962 --> 00:31:37.064 position:16% line:83% align:start
Which is why I prepared
a countermeasure!

00:31:37.097 --> 00:31:39.166 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your power's weakness
gave me an idea,

00:31:39.199 --> 00:31:41.068 position:24% line:83% align:start
so I came up with
a little something.

00:31:41.101 --> 00:31:43.303 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's an interception
device that's called...

00:31:43.904 --> 00:31:46.641 position:7% line:89% align:start
Specular Reflection Maneuver!

00:31:46.674 --> 00:31:49.476 position:38% line:89% align:start
Damn...

00:31:49.511 --> 00:31:53.981 position:30% line:89% align:start
[KOMEI laughs]

00:31:54.014 --> 00:31:59.019 position:7% line:83% align:start
[KOMEI] Now, struggle against
the power of my maneuvers!

00:31:59.052 --> 00:32:05.292 position:7% line:83% align:start
Straw Hat Luffy, your friends'
lives are now in my hands!

00:32:07.428 --> 00:32:11.365 position:5% line:5% align:start
[KOMEI] Pirate Hunter and Black
Foot can't even move now.

00:32:11.398 --> 00:32:13.967 position:21% line:83% align:start
However... Straw Hat
managed to escape.

00:32:14.001 --> 00:32:15.737 position:27% line:83% align:start
I predicted that
would be the case.

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:17.572 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's why I mentioned the cure.

00:32:17.605 --> 00:32:19.440 position:19% line:83% align:start
I knew what they'd do
once they heard about

00:32:19.473 --> 00:32:20.575 position:19% line:89% align:start
the Rebound Mushroom.

00:32:20.608 --> 00:32:22.544 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, really? You did?

00:32:22.577 --> 00:32:24.612 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's time for the next
stage of the plan.

00:32:24.646 --> 00:32:27.549 position:21% line:83% align:start
Go spread the news.
I want everything ready.

00:32:27.582 --> 00:32:29.183 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes, sir!

00:32:30.585 --> 00:32:32.186 position:27% line:89% align:start
[USOPP grunting]

00:32:32.219 --> 00:32:35.255 position:27% line:89% align:start
[PIRATES grunt]

00:32:39.761 --> 00:32:41.495 position:21% line:89% align:start
[FOXY PIRATES yelp]

00:32:44.599 --> 00:32:47.535 position:30% line:83% align:start
[FOXY PIRATES]
There! We're back!

00:32:47.569 --> 00:32:49.102 position:30% line:89% align:start
[FOXY growls]

[USOPP sighs]

00:32:52.439 --> 00:32:55.275 position:5% line:83% align:start
[FRANKY] That was trippy! What's
up with this Slow-Slow crap?

00:32:55.309 --> 00:32:57.745 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
Oh! Foxy ate a Devil Fruit, too.

00:32:57.779 --> 00:33:00.782 position:10% line:83% align:start
It was the Slow Slow Fruit,
giving him slow abilities.

00:33:00.815 --> 00:33:04.786 position:7% line:83% align:start
So anything that's exposed to
his Slow-Slow Beam slows down

00:33:04.819 --> 00:33:08.388 position:10% line:83% align:start
for about 30 seconds or so.
Almost like they're frozen.

00:33:08.422 --> 00:33:09.624 position:38% line:83% align:start
[BROOK]
Thirty seconds, eh?

00:33:09.657 --> 00:33:11.693 position:7% line:89% align:start
Imagine that. It felt longer.

00:33:11.726 --> 00:33:14.361 position:13% line:83% align:start
[FRANKY] But that nut-job
slowed himself down, too.

00:33:14.394 --> 00:33:16.230 position:5% line:89% align:start
Pretty pathetic, if you ask me.

00:33:16.263 --> 00:33:18.232 position:30% line:89% align:start
[LUFFY grunts]

00:33:18.265 --> 00:33:20.668 position:33% line:89% align:start
Zoro. Sanji.

00:33:20.702 --> 00:33:23.103 position:13% line:83% align:start
They could've captured all
of us if they wanted to.

00:33:23.136 --> 00:33:24.304 position:24% line:89% align:start
Why'd they leave?

00:33:24.338 --> 00:33:25.740 position:13% line:89% align:start
What are those guys up to?

00:33:25.773 --> 00:33:28.510 position:13% line:83% align:start
And they told us about the
Rebound Mushroom, as well.

00:33:28.543 --> 00:33:31.245 position:13% line:89% align:start
It doesn't make any sense.

00:33:31.278 --> 00:33:33.480 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Yeah, you're right.

00:33:33.515 --> 00:33:37.117 position:10% line:83% align:start
He also invited us to follow
him, and gave us this.

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:39.186 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's a trap. Without a doubt.

00:33:39.219 --> 00:33:41.154 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes, you're right.

00:33:41.188 --> 00:33:42.757 position:16% line:89% align:start
And that Vice Admiral...

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:45.660 position:13% line:83% align:start
He turned out to be quite
the tactician, huh.

00:33:52.232 --> 00:33:53.500 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Let's go.

00:33:53.535 --> 00:33:54.702 position:44% line:89% align:start
Now!

00:33:54.736 --> 00:33:55.603 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's the spirit!

00:33:55.637 --> 00:33:58.438 position:21% line:83% align:start
Even if it's a trap,
we still gotta go!

00:33:58.472 --> 00:34:01.609 position:5% line:83% align:start
We must save Zoro and Sanji, no
matter what they have planned!

00:34:01.643 --> 00:34:04.278 position:13% line:83% align:start
A little Rebound Mushroom
should heal them right up!

00:34:04.311 --> 00:34:06.648 position:10% line:83% align:start
Which means we need to scout
around and find some!

00:34:06.681 --> 00:34:08.716 position:27% line:83% align:start
Leave it to me!
I'll find 'em, for sure!

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:11.819 position:13% line:83% align:start
[ROBIN] Is this enough of
a lead, Mister Bloodhound?

[CHOPPER sniffs]

00:34:13.053 --> 00:34:15.857 position:7% line:83% align:start
I held one in my hand earlier.
Is the scent still there?

00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:20.160 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yep! Now I know exactly
what to look for!

00:34:20.193 --> 00:34:22.697 position:13% line:83% align:start
[BROOK] And I'll help you
out in the best way I can.

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:25.098 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll come with you,
but not just conventionally.

00:34:25.132 --> 00:34:27.134 position:27% line:83% align:start
If I separate my
body from my soul,

00:34:27.167 --> 00:34:28.870 position:21% line:83% align:start
there's no limit to
my field of search!

Straw Hat!

Who's this amazing
new crew member?

00:34:33.541 --> 00:34:35.577 position:21% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] It's Brook!
He's a living legend,

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:38.345 position:7% line:83% align:start
[USOPP] "Living" isn't exactly
how I'd describe him...

00:34:40.782 --> 00:34:42.316 position:24% line:89% align:start
Sorry about this.

Huh?

who ate the Rebound Mushroom.

00:34:46.186 --> 00:34:48.455 position:13% line:89% align:start
I should apologize to you.

00:34:48.488 --> 00:34:52.259 position:13% line:83% align:start
I kind of set you guys up
and led you into a trap.

00:34:52.292 --> 00:34:53.561 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:34:53.595 --> 00:34:54.729 position:44% line:89% align:start
Heh!

[CHOPPER]
Luffy! You go on ahead.

00:34:59.701 --> 00:35:02.135 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll catch up with you
after I find the mushroom.

00:35:02.169 --> 00:35:03.437 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Got it!

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:05.472 position:24% line:83% align:start
With this, you'll
catch up in no time.

Thanks, Franky.

Take these with you.

[FRANKY]
Sure.

00:35:11.579 --> 00:35:13.781 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll put these into

[LUFFY]
Good luck! I'm counting on you!

Hey, Straw Hat!

00:35:21.956 --> 00:35:23.691 position:33% line:89% align:start

It's obvious that many

Yes, what is it, Kansho?

00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:18.940 position:5% line:83% align:start
I would really like it if you'd

I'm still relatively
new to your crew,

so I wanna prove myself to you

The more people
you have searching,

together, side-by-side.

00:38:50.598 --> 00:38:52.465 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, this time,
we have the same goal,

00:38:52.499 --> 00:38:54.501 position:16% line:89% align:start
so it only makes sense.

No matter how many
Davy Back Fights I won,

as long as we had
that Jolly Roger,

part of his plan, too.

Zoro was the first one
to join my crew.

Well, what a coincidence!

00:40:21.255 --> 00:40:24.558 position:19% line:83% align:start
My first crew members
were Porche and Hamburg.

No matter how many crew members
have come and gone through

of our friendship,

But since they're pirates,

we can't just set
them free, can we.

That's not it, either! Aw...

00:42:49.703 --> 00:42:53.074 position:16% line:83% align:start
[BROOK] We just have to
keep looking, patiently.

Oh, wow!

I thought my heart was going to
pop right out of my chest!

Although... I don't

Hey, guys!

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:24.672 position:10% line:83% align:start

No! Stay away! Stay away!

That's one heck of a steel trap!

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:37.651 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hold on. That wouldn't
happen to be

00:43:37.685 --> 00:43:38.986 position:10% line:83% align:start
some sort of Foxy trickery,
would it?

00:43:39.019 --> 00:43:40.387 position:38% line:83% align:start
[CAPOTE]
No, of course not!

00:43:40.421 --> 00:43:42.123 position:33% line:89% align:start
Take a look!

00:43:42.156 --> 00:43:43.791 position:44% line:89% align:start
See?

00:43:44.725 --> 00:43:48.696 position:10% line:83% align:start
I guess Komei the strategist
had a back-up plan.

00:43:48.729 --> 00:43:50.197 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:43:50.231 --> 00:43:51.799 position:24% line:89% align:start
What is it, Brook?

00:43:51.832 --> 00:43:54.335 position:21% line:83% align:start
Shh! The situation
has changed, Chopper.

00:43:54.368 --> 00:43:56.003 position:24% line:89% align:start
Something's wrong.

00:43:56.036 --> 00:43:57.671 position:13% line:89% align:start
I can feel it in my bones.

00:43:57.705 --> 00:43:59.273 position:35% line:89% align:start
Literally.

00:43:59.306 --> 00:44:01.008 position:24% line:89% align:start
We're surrounded.

00:44:02.743 --> 00:44:03.944 position:38% line:83% align:start
[BROOK]
Look out!

00:44:18.058 --> 00:44:19.326 position:21% line:89% align:start
Is that the island?

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:20.161 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, for sure.

00:44:20.194 --> 00:44:22.696 position:19% line:83% align:start
The needle's pointing
right at it.

00:44:25.799 --> 00:44:28.469 position:10% line:83% align:start
I see a pirate ship closing
in from the west, sir!

00:44:28.502 --> 00:44:30.838 position:27% line:83% align:start
It has the Straw

Here they come.

00:44:33.974 --> 00:44:36.844 position:7% line:83% align:start
Take the crane-wing formation
and surround the ship!

[MARINE K]
Yes, sir.

00:44:41.315 --> 00:44:42.449 position:24% line:89% align:start
Just as I thought.

00:44:42.483 --> 00:44:43.652 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's an ambush!

00:44:43.684 --> 00:44:45.986 position:5% line:83% align:start
They're splittin' up so they can
attack us from both sides.

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:47.054 position:33% line:89% align:start
This is bad.

00:44:47.087 --> 00:44:48.222 position:24% line:83% align:start
Since they're all
over the place,

00:44:48.255 --> 00:44:50.191 position:21% line:83% align:start
even the Gaon Cannon

I studied the sea battles

00:44:51.792 --> 00:44:53.427 position:13% line:89% align:start
of the Straw Hats closely.

00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:55.796 position:24% line:83% align:start
This plan exploits
their weaknesses,

00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:57.831 position:10% line:89% align:start
like their lack of gunners.

00:44:57.865 --> 00:44:59.800 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, no! They're
already shooting!

[LUFFY]
What?

00:45:30.565 --> 00:45:31.899 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's awesome!

They're not completely stopped,

it certainly looks like it.

Cool!

00:45:38.138 --> 00:45:39.373 position:24% line:83% align:start
How long will they
stay like this?

00:45:39.406 --> 00:45:40.975 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, the usual 30 seconds.

Wait, it's stronger,
but it's not longer?

00:46:34.194 --> 00:46:36.531 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's useful, depending
on how you use it.

Well, it's a pain if

But going fast is
a bunch of crap!

What's with this island?

00:47:30.217 --> 00:47:31.151 position:33% line:89% align:start
Interesting.

00:47:31.185 --> 00:47:34.088 position:19% line:83% align:start
This type of formation
is called a caldera.

00:47:34.121 --> 00:47:35.189 position:27% line:89% align:start
And take a look.

00:47:35.222 --> 00:47:37.958 position:21% line:83% align:start
There appears to be
a volcanic vent in the basin.

00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:44.932 position:10% line:89% align:start
Uh. Whatever this place is,

Take a look at those buildings
sticking out of the rock towers.

00:47:51.606 --> 00:47:55.342 position:5% line:83% align:start
They certainly give off that

it's the Straw Hat crew.

I'm actually after all of you.

00:49:01.241 --> 00:49:04.478 position:21% line:83% align:start
I suggest you focus
on finding your friends.

Let's make it a game.

00:49:06.714 --> 00:49:09.983 position:5% line:83% align:start
You have until daybreak tomorrow
to find your crewmates.

00:49:10.017 --> 00:49:12.986 position:13% line:83% align:start
Rescue them before the sun
rises above the horizon.

00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:15.623 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you do that, you win. If you
fail, rest assured that you

00:49:15.657 --> 00:49:19.627 position:13% line:83% align:start
will fall into my clutches

00:54:57.064 --> 00:54:59.499 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's exactly what we needed.

00:54:59.534 --> 00:55:03.436 position:10% line:83% align:start
It solves the query: How can
ordinary humans hope to stand up

00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:05.438 position:30% line:83% align:start
to those with
Devil Fruit powers?

00:55:05.472 --> 00:55:08.475 position:5% line:83% align:start
How can a soldier stop a pirate
with such strength?

00:55:08.509 --> 00:55:10.678 position:27% line:83% align:start
It gave us more
than just a plan.

00:55:10.711 --> 00:55:13.915 position:16% line:83% align:start
It gave us a much-needed
geographical advantage.

00:55:13.948 --> 00:55:15.116 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes!

00:55:15.149 --> 00:55:19.120 position:10% line:83% align:start
The island itself has proven
to be their worst nightmare.

00:55:19.153 --> 00:55:21.088 position:13% line:89% align:start
It naturally exercises the

00:55:21.122 --> 00:55:24.357 position:19% line:83% align:start
"Ability Nullification
Maneuver"!

00:55:24.391 --> 00:55:26.359 position:5% line:89% align:start
The bait was carefully laid out,

00:55:26.393 --> 00:55:31.032 position:5% line:83% align:start
and our prey has been lured in,
exactly as I designed.

00:55:31.065 --> 00:55:32.233 position:27% line:89% align:start
I don't get it.

00:55:32.266 --> 00:55:35.435 position:7% line:83% align:start
Those of us who've eaten Devil
Fruits have gained powers

00:55:35.468 --> 00:55:37.839 position:13% line:83% align:start
most ordinary humans have
little defense against.

00:55:37.872 --> 00:55:41.108 position:13% line:83% align:start
But in doing so, we also
inherited the wrath of the sea.

00:55:41.142 --> 00:55:42.310 position:24% line:89% align:start
Wrath of the sea?

00:55:42.342 --> 00:55:44.979 position:5% line:83% align:start
Legend has it that Devil Fruits
are actually incarnations

00:55:45.012 --> 00:55:48.381 position:10% line:83% align:start
of the Sea Devil. Even just
the slightest bit of seawater

00:55:48.415 --> 00:55:50.051 position:13% line:89% align:start
can weaken a power holder.

00:55:50.084 --> 00:55:52.385 position:27% line:83% align:start
So if they ever
fall into the sea...

00:55:52.419 --> 00:55:55.156 position:7% line:83% align:start
Unless someone's there to help
them, they won't come back up.

00:55:55.189 --> 00:55:57.959 position:7% line:83% align:start
And everything on this island
is like Sea Prism Stone.

00:55:57.992 --> 00:55:59.760 position:19% line:89% align:start
What's that, exactly?

00:55:59.794 --> 00:56:02.864 position:5% line:83% align:start
Special stones that contain the
same properties as seawater.

00:56:02.897 --> 00:56:04.131 position:16% line:89% align:start
What? Are you saying...?

00:56:04.165 --> 00:56:07.500 position:5% line:83% align:start
The Navy has handcuffs for power
holders forged from that stuff.

00:56:07.535 --> 00:56:10.571 position:5% line:83% align:start
And since it has basically the
same effect on 'em as seawater,

00:56:10.605 --> 00:56:11.606 position:13% line:89% align:start
it renders them powerless.

00:56:11.639 --> 00:56:13.941 position:24% line:83% align:start
[KANSHO] No way!
That means this entire island

00:56:13.975 --> 00:56:15.710 position:13% line:89% align:start
is a danger zone for them!

00:56:15.743 --> 00:56:18.880 position:7% line:83% align:start
After that Davy Back trap, he
left Luffy behind on purpose.

00:56:18.913 --> 00:56:20.581 position:24% line:83% align:start
He knew we'd take
the bait and come here

00:56:20.615 --> 00:56:22.116 position:7% line:89% align:start
where he could capture us all.

Out of your entire crew,

01:08:12.927 --> 01:08:17.364 position:10% line:83% align:start
the Cat Burglar is the only
friend you've got left.

No matter how you look at it,

01:08:19.399 --> 01:08:22.604 position:21% line:83% align:start
you now appear to be
greatly outmatched.

01:08:22.637 --> 01:08:23.705 position:24% line:89% align:start
With that in mind,

01:08:23.738 --> 01:08:27.207 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'd like to offer to change
the rules a little bit.

Change them?

all of your captured friends
outside to the surface.

In exchange for doing so,

01:08:39.721 --> 01:08:43.190 position:19% line:83% align:start

get them on your own.

What is that?

01:12:49.003 --> 01:12:49.971 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KOMEI]
I must admit,

01:12:50.004 --> 01:12:53.608 position:19% line:83% align:start
hidden pitfalls happen
to be my favorite traps.

simple forms of deception

01:12:56.010 --> 01:12:58.746 position:13% line:83% align:start
ever conceived, it remains
quite effective.

01:12:58.779 --> 01:13:00.948 position:13% line:83% align:start
An "oldie, but a goodie,"

[KOMEI]
I call this one...

These absurd deep-seeded
feelings you hold for your crew

01:13:11.225 --> 01:13:13.561 position:5% line:89% align:start
will ultimately be your undoing.

Below you, there is seawater.

01:13:15.529 --> 01:13:17.098 position:19% line:89% align:start
Ah, that explains it.

[KOMEI]
It's the same advantage,

01:13:18.666 --> 01:13:21.168 position:21% line:83% align:start
but it keeps working
over and over again.

[LUFFY groans]
You jerk.

01:13:25.673 --> 01:13:28.441 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KOMEI]
Are you scared yet?

01:13:28.475 --> 01:13:29.777 position:21% line:89% align:start
When I was a child,

01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:33.080 position:27% line:83% align:start
I experienced an
even greater terror.

01:13:33.114 --> 01:13:35.583 position:16% line:83% align:start
And the ones responsible
for inflicting that fear

01:13:35.616 --> 01:13:38.586 position:21% line:83% align:start
were none other than
a band of pirates!

01:13:38.619 --> 01:13:41.155 position:30% line:83% align:start
They rampaged
through my hometown.

01:13:41.188 --> 01:13:45.059 position:7% line:83% align:start
It was a hideous tragedy that
I couldn't stand to witness!

01:13:45.092 --> 01:13:49.063 position:19% line:83% align:start
Pirates are pure evil!
Understand?

01:13:49.096 --> 01:13:51.799 position:21% line:83% align:start
When I came of age,
I joined the Navy to fight

01:13:51.832 --> 01:13:55.569 position:13% line:83% align:start
against the pirate scourge
and eradicate it! However,

01:13:55.603 --> 01:13:58.471 position:5% line:89% align:start
I then faced a shameful reality.

01:13:58.506 --> 01:14:01.809 position:10% line:83% align:start
Both the World Government,
and the Navy, tolerated pirates

01:14:01.842 --> 01:14:04.245 position:27% line:83% align:start
to help maintain
order on the seas!

01:14:04.278 --> 01:14:07.748 position:5% line:83% align:start
The people at the top can't see
how ordinary citizens

01:14:07.782 --> 01:14:12.753 position:7% line:83% align:start
are living under the constant
threat of pirate violence!

01:14:12.787 --> 01:14:16.257 position:13% line:83% align:start
The Great Pirate Era will
never end at this rate!

01:14:16.290 --> 01:14:18.491 position:16% line:83% align:start
The powers-that-be hope
to save the world

01:14:18.526 --> 01:14:20.661 position:19% line:83% align:start
by countering violence
with violence!

01:14:20.695 --> 01:14:22.797 position:19% line:83% align:start
Does that leave those
without special abilities

01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:25.866 position:19% line:83% align:start
unable to fight back
or defend themselves?

01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:31.138 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nay! Mankind still has a weapon.
And that would be its wisdom!

01:14:31.172 --> 01:14:32.773 position:5% line:89% align:start
Using my maneuvers and cunning,

01:14:32.807 --> 01:14:35.176 position:16% line:83% align:start
I will bring an end to
this cycle of violence!

01:14:35.209 --> 01:14:38.179 position:13% line:83% align:start
Only then will those who
have lived in constant fear

Well, it's a cool ship,
so that'll work.

The most important thing onboard
is those two over there.

01:40:21.154 --> 01:40:22.389 position:13% line:89% align:start
And luckily, we took back

01:40:22.422 --> 01:40:24.424 position:27% line:83% align:start
the second most
important thing, too.

I'm thinking it's not
so bad after all.
