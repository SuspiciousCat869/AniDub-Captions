Well, what do we have here?

Good afternoon.

Oh, I thought you were a goner.

Geez. You didn't even slow down!

00:04:03,373 --> 00:04:05,027
[EMI KAIDO] Good afternoon.

47
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,464
[GATCHAMAN] I just asked you a
question... Are you hurt?

00:04:07,508 --> 00:04:10,337

We're just two guys.

I guess you could say we're...
heroes, okay?

73
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:22,757
[KEN WASHIO] Heroes?

74
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,195
They don't exist, so you can
drop it.

75
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:30,417
Hey, I need you to take me back
to my world, ok?

76
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,723
There's no world for you to
return to.

77
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:33,855
What!?

78
00:05:33,898 --> 00:05:36,292
I knew it would turn out like
this.

79
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,904
The same exact thing happened
to me... about a year ago.

This isn't a joke!

We're asking for your help.

00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,134
Speaking of which, what's your
name anyway?

00:05:54,963 --> 00:05:56,617
I'm Emi Kaido.

My name means laughter.

88
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:00,098
I'm Ken.

00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:02,840
Takeshi. Nice to meet ya!

90
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:04,320
I'm Joji.

91
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,108
[grunt]

92
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:14,591
I'm Tetsuya.

93
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:17,725
[JOJI] He developed a device
for inter dimensional travel,

94
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:19,727
and journeys across worlds,

95
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,338

another.

96
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,820
[TAKESHI YOROI] So Professor,
what's his name?

97
00:06:25,863 --> 00:06:28,475
[JOJI] His alias is the last
letter of the alphabet,

98
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:30,825
fitting for all the death
and destruction.

99
00:06:30,868 --> 00:06:32,087
[TAKESHI YOROI] Z.

100
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,133
[JOJI] He destroys using the
Case.

101
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:37,440
[KEN WASHIO] Case?

102
00:06:37,484 --> 00:06:41,009
[JOJI] The Case... changes the
possibilities of all worlds.

103
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:42,750
[TAKESHI] It grants its
wielder's every wish,

104
00:06:42,793 --> 00:06:44,316
making it the ultimate weapon.

105
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,579
[JOJI] Some have even said

106
00:06:45,622 --> 00:06:48,103
it's a reflection of its
wielder's soul.

107
00:06:48,146 --> 00:06:51,498
Resting in Z's hands is a
blazing manifestation

108
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,108
of that power.

109
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:58,113
I witnessed it! I saw how that
sun consumed my entire world!

110
00:06:58,156 --> 00:07:00,768
[JOJI] The Case is no longer in
his possession.

111
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:02,030
[KEN] What?

112
00:07:02,073 --> 00:07:04,815
[JOJI] It has now taken the form
of that pencil.

113
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:05,860
[EMI] Huh?

114
00:07:14,825 --> 00:07:17,219
[KAIDO] In a reality
identical to our own,

115
00:07:17,262 --> 00:07:20,396
I found several other worlds
you and I were a part of.

116
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,964
-But every time...
-Daddy?

117
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:24,835
[KAIDO] ...there was an
incident, an accident,

118
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:25,880
or illness.

119
00:07:25,923 --> 00:07:27,621
And in every one
of these worlds,

120
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:29,449
you died as a young girl.

121
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:31,233
What's this?!

122
00:07:31,276 --> 00:07:34,410
Emi's death is all but
guaranteed.

123
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,717
No it can't be! That can't be
true.

124
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,719
I know...

125
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:42,679
A world without Emi is... It's
impossible.

126
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:46,248
Initially I was certain that
your life would cease to exist.

127
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,642
I thought there was nothing I
could do about it.

128
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:50,905
But suddenly...

129
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:53,603
...it fell into my hands.

130
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:56,998
I had the power to manipulate
possibilities.

131
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,479
It granted me my deepest wish.

132
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:01,393
So, you mean the...

133
00:08:01,437 --> 00:08:03,570
Yes. The Case.

134
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,270
I proclaimed my wish to the
Case.

135
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:14,276
I wished for my daughter to
live.

136
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,236
You did? That was... your true
wish?

137
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,281
It was.

138
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:25,330
[KAZUMICHI KAIDO] After that,
I used the Case...

139
00:08:25,374 --> 00:08:27,158
to diverge the future.

140
00:08:27,202 --> 00:08:28,812
Diverge?

141
00:08:28,856 --> 00:08:32,294
[KAZUMICHI KAIDO] At any moment,
people face a number of choices.

142
00:08:32,337 --> 00:08:38,474
A world where one turns right. A
world where one turns left.

143
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,868
The Case gave me the power
to create a world

144
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:42,609
with new possibilities.

145
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:44,611
Like this one.

146
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:47,483
The world you inhabit now...

147
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:53,968
The world you live in... is the
one that I have chosen for you.

148
00:08:54,011 --> 00:08:57,449
It's the world where...

149
00:08:57,493 --> 00:09:00,235
Emi Kaido doesn't die.

150
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:06,763
Emi...

151
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:11,768
Kaido's been destroying worlds.
That way, Emi never has to die.

152
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:16,164
So if we shut down Kaido, Emi
could potentially die?

153
00:09:16,207 --> 00:09:19,167
I will create my own
possibilities.

154
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:25,173
With every step I take, I know
the world will be there.

155
00:09:29,046 --> 00:09:30,439
[KAZUMICHI KAIDO] Why won't you
stop?!

156
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:33,921
This world will guarantee your
happiness forever!

157
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:38,273
[small chuckle] You're wrong,
Dad.

158
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:42,451
This world... would give me
everlasting life but...

159
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:46,194
There's more to happiness...
than just a beating heart!

160
00:09:46,237 --> 00:09:49,284
I'm not afraid. I want to choose
my own way.

161
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:52,766
[gasp]

162
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:54,594
[whimper]

163
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:56,857
Why are you doing this?

164
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,601
I will carry on... of my own
free will!

165
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:05,126
[gasp]

166

Six years ago, the inorganic

came to this planet.

They were relentless. A threat
to all intelligent life.

Our weapons proved to be
ineffective against them,

No sir. The Ministry voted to
put you in charge of Nexus.

I admit not everyone agreed.

Some people... still oppose the

307
00:23:10,606 --> 00:23:14,305
There's no point for us to share
any of our data.

308
00:23:14,349 --> 00:23:15,829
You know that...

309
00:23:15,872 --> 00:23:18,658
We cannot move Nexus to another
site.

310
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:20,442
That's the problem.

311
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:23,663
There's so much military power
in our possession

312
00:23:23,706 --> 00:23:25,316
right here in this very spot.

313
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,101
We're hardly in any position

314
00:23:27,144 --> 00:23:29,756
to tell the world they
shouldn't worry.

315
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:32,280
I suppose not.

316
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:36,676
Also... more people are becoming
aware of its power...

317
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:39,374
...and aware of its unique
feature.

318
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:44,031
If that should... become common
knowledge...

319
00:23:44,074 --> 00:23:48,339
That is exactly the reason... to
keep control of it ourselves.

320
00:23:48,383 --> 00:23:50,124
You agree, don't you?

321
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:53,170
This situation requires one
supreme power

322
00:23:53,214 --> 00:23:54,781
with a steady hand.

323
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:08,577
It seems your plan to make Nexus
independent from federal

324
00:24:08,621 --> 00:24:13,190
negotiations simply raises
too many concerns.

325
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:14,714
And as always,

326
00:24:14,757 --> 00:24:17,412
the Ministry of Defense is
reluctant to lend personnel.

327
00:24:20,328 --> 00:24:21,634
I understand...

328
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:24,724
The top brass is feeling
pressure from abroad.

329
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:28,641
Things will change when public
opinion does.

330
00:24:28,684 --> 00:24:31,382
Surely that will happen.

331
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:33,907
You're an idealist.

332
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:37,258
And your idealism undeniably
empowered our nation.

333
00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:41,001
That said... I hope it won't be
your downfall.

334
00:24:41,044 --> 00:24:44,439
Well you needn't worry about
that.

335
00:24:46,093 --> 00:24:47,921
Fair enough.

336
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:50,184
I trust all the preparations...

337
00:24:50,227 --> 00:24:52,099
are in order for
today's ceremony?

338
00:24:52,142 --> 00:24:55,102
Yes and it will be
well attended.

339
00:24:55,145 --> 00:24:58,497
Many young people are anxious
about our country's future.

340
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,108
Hopefully, my speech...

341
00:25:01,151 --> 00:25:02,849
will convince them that
they should unite

342
00:25:02,892 --> 00:25:04,764
behind our shared goals.

345
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:15,122
And it's not coming from Nexus?

346
00:25:15,165 --> 00:25:17,472
Investigate right away.

347
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:21,781
Doctor, we have intruders on
Security Level 3.

348
00:25:21,824 --> 00:25:23,565
What the devil...?

349
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:26,525
Why weren't they detected
earlier on Levels 1 or 2?

350
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:27,830
[SECURITY GUARD] It seems...

351
00:25:27,874 --> 00:25:29,789
they just appeared out of
nowhere in Level 3.

352
00:25:29,832 --> 00:25:31,094
Out of nowhere?

353
00:25:31,138 --> 00:25:32,531
What does that mean?

354
00:25:44,238 --> 00:25:46,240
It's eerily quiet here.

355
00:25:46,283 --> 00:25:48,155
Not a single person around...

356
00:25:49,852 --> 00:25:52,986
Joji... learn anything yet?

357
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:55,379
[JOJI] There's a Singularity in
the center of the dome,

358
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:56,816
that's for certain.

359
00:25:56,859 --> 00:26:00,820
It looks like it's about ten
meters below the ground.

360
00:26:00,863 --> 00:26:03,257
It should have formed at the
point where Emi and

361
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,173
the Case became separated
but it's slightly off.

362
00:26:07,783 --> 00:26:09,742
It's also possible that
space-time is warped

363
00:26:09,785 --> 00:26:11,787
in this world.

364
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:14,921
[KEN WASHIO] Is it too risky for
Emi to get close to it?

365
00:26:14,964 --> 00:26:16,662
I don't have enough data yet.

366
00:26:16,705 --> 00:26:19,447
The dome is under government
control.

367
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,668
There are sensors and security
cameras all over it.

368
00:26:25,148 --> 00:26:27,020
[TETSUYA AZUMA] We're being

Awe gimme a break.

371
00:26:34,288 --> 00:26:35,376
[JOJI] This might be

372
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:37,030
more trouble than it's
worth right now.

373
00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:40,033
I think maybe we should gather
some more data first.

374
00:26:40,076 --> 00:26:40,990

Hm?

376
00:26:42,426 --> 00:26:45,429
It looks like there are two vans
coming toward you.

377
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:47,475
They're probably security.

378
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,307
Now what?

379
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,310
Now what? We've come this far.
Might as well get it over with.

380
00:26:56,353 --> 00:26:58,704
Hang on. Let's wait and see.

No need to rush, Princess.

00:27:14,241 --> 00:27:15,634
Ken...

384
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:17,984
How did he...

385
00:27:18,027 --> 00:27:20,029
You know this guy?

386
00:27:20,073 --> 00:27:21,683
Yeah...

387
00:27:21,727 --> 00:27:25,992
The doctor here... originally
created the Science Ninja Team.

388
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:27,297
Be ready.

389
00:27:27,341 --> 00:27:28,821
Yes sir.

390
00:27:30,866 --> 00:27:33,826
Doctor Nambu, listen to me.

391
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:36,306
I'm not the Ken you used to
know.

392
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,918
Now it makes sense.

393
00:27:38,961 --> 00:27:40,920
So that's what's happened.

394
00:27:40,963 --> 00:27:44,097
Oh wow. You catch on fast there,
don't ya?

395
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,576
Hey Gramps,

396
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,275
it's nice you found a friend but
can we hurry it up now?

397
00:27:48,318 --> 00:27:49,450
Don't call me "gramps!"

398
00:27:49,493 --> 00:27:51,278
Let's just cut to the chase,
okay?

399
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:53,672
This man is-hey stop wait a
minute...!

400
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:56,500
You have it, don't you?...

401
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,198
The Singularity?

402
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:01,767
It's in there, right?

403
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:05,031
We're gonna get rid of it.

404
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:09,426
Doctor?

405
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,951
"The Singularity...?"

406
00:28:11,994 --> 00:28:13,561
To put it simply,

407
00:28:13,604 --> 00:28:17,347
it's an abnormal accumulation of
energy from a certain source.

408
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:19,741
I understand...

409
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:22,613
So that's the term you're using
for it then?

410
00:28:22,657 --> 00:28:24,964
You know about it?

411
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:27,662
By a different name.

412
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,317
Why are you so interested in
getting rid of it?

413
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,974
It's dangerous. It could cause
this world to become imbalanced.

414
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:36,627
We have to destroy it.

415
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:38,673
Hmm.

416
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:42,808
Ken, ask about the purpose of
the dome.

417
00:28:42,851 --> 00:28:43,896
Huh?

418
00:28:43,939 --> 00:28:45,071

Uh... Roger that.

420
00:28:49,118 --> 00:28:52,992
Doctor, what exactly is that
dome for anyway?

00:28:55,908 --> 00:29:00,390
Well well... it appears we're
going to be enemies.

00:34:43,777 --> 00:34:45,083
[gasp]

502
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:55,528
[frightened gasp] ...Okay!

503
00:35:01,403 --> 00:35:02,361
[painful grunt]

504
00:35:02,404 --> 00:35:03,449
Hey...!

505
00:35:11,065 --> 00:35:13,111
Okay, here's the proof.

506
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:15,939
These lowlifes are linked to the
enemy.

507
00:35:15,983 --> 00:35:18,072
That should make things easier.

508
00:35:20,422 --> 00:35:22,511
[grunt]

509
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:23,860
Watch it...

510
00:35:23,904 --> 00:35:25,949
Get a hold of yourself, Joe!

511
00:35:25,993 --> 00:35:28,909
[grunt]

512
00:35:31,607 --> 00:35:33,566
[punching grunt]

[fighting grunts]

514
00:35:45,447 --> 00:35:48,058
[fighting grunts]

515
00:35:48,102 --> 00:35:50,104
Damn you!

516
00:35:51,105 --> 00:35:52,672
...Joe!

517
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:55,240
[DR. NAMBU] Sounds like a lively
exchange.

518
00:35:55,283 --> 00:35:58,112
[KEN] I'm sorry, Doctor.

519
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,898
Now I know how schoolteachers
must feel.

520
00:36:01,942 --> 00:36:03,161
[sigh]

521
00:36:03,204 --> 00:36:05,032
What's wrong?

522
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:09,863
I don't understand...

523
00:36:09,906 --> 00:36:12,822
Why bring Joe onto the Science
Ninja Team?

524
00:36:12,866 --> 00:36:14,433
Hmm?

525
00:36:14,476 --> 00:36:15,869
[sigh]

526
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:18,828
I'm not going to deny the guy's
ability as a fighter...

527
00:36:18,872 --> 00:36:20,352
...and he is smart.

528
00:36:20,395 --> 00:36:22,876
But the thing is...

529
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:25,270
He doesn't have what it takes...

530
00:36:25,313 --> 00:36:27,533
to truly understand
right from wrong.

531
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,189
I'd say that's probably true.

532
00:36:32,668 --> 00:36:36,106
However... the information he's
always able to obtain

533
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,891
has certainly made
our work easier.

534
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,286
Yeah but it's not about that!

535
00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:43,462
[chuckle]

536
00:36:43,505 --> 00:36:46,465
Your righteousness knows no
bounds, Ken.

537
00:36:46,508 --> 00:36:48,728
And that's funny to you?!

538
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:51,252
There was only one person

539
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:54,124
I thought worthy of the
title Gatchaman...

540
00:36:54,168 --> 00:36:57,171
...And that's you, Ken.

541
00:36:58,607 --> 00:37:01,306
Gatchaman is a symbol of hope
for people.

542
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:04,918
That's why it's perfect for you.

543
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:08,661
...Joe witnessed the murder of
his parents as a child...

544
00:37:08,704 --> 00:37:12,186
...but he turned his pain into
the power to fight evil.

545
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,755
You could call it a dark form of
justice.

546
00:37:15,798 --> 00:37:20,020
But Ken, if you are to shine the
light of hope upon the world...

547
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:24,590
Then naturally... someone must
become the shadow.

548
00:37:25,547 --> 00:37:29,290
We need Joe. All of us need him.

549
00:37:29,334 --> 00:37:35,253
But, in my opinion... you
need him most of all.

550
00:37:43,043 --> 00:37:47,787
[weak grunts]

551
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:50,442
Oh, you're finally awake.

552
00:37:50,485 --> 00:37:52,487
Hey good morning, gramps.

553
00:37:52,531 --> 00:37:56,535
Actually... I take that back cuz
it's not exactly good.

554
00:37:56,578 --> 00:38:02,497
[grunts] I'm okay. It's nothing.

555
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:06,980
It is really you, right? You're
the real Ken I've always known?

556
00:38:07,023 --> 00:38:12,115
Yeah. You never came back, so I
went looking for you.

557
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:14,640
Not that I knew where to look.

558
00:38:14,683 --> 00:38:16,729
We searched through every world.

559
00:38:16,772 --> 00:38:20,646
And only one had an
gravitational abnormality.

560
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:23,997
That's what led us here.

561
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,739
[JOJI] So, Ken wasn't the only
one from his team pulled

562
00:38:26,782 --> 00:38:28,436
into another world by Kaido.

563
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,571
[JOE] Yeah... I remember being
swallowed by the sun,

564
00:38:32,614 --> 00:38:34,573
and then waking
up in this world.

565
00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:38,141
...It was a hell of a shock.

566
00:38:38,185 --> 00:38:39,491
Especially since,

567
00:38:39,534 --> 00:38:42,494
there was another version
of me already here.

568
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:45,801
Wow that sounds really bizarre.

569
00:38:45,845 --> 00:38:49,631
What was it like to actually
come face to face with yourself?

570
00:38:49,675 --> 00:38:53,983
No big deal... same as looking
in a mirror really.

571
00:38:54,027 --> 00:38:55,637
What about me?

572
00:38:55,681 --> 00:38:58,031
And what about the rest of the
Science Ninja Team?

573
00:38:58,074 --> 00:39:00,381
Why aren't they with you now?

574
00:39:00,425 --> 00:39:03,863
Because the Science Ninja Team
of this world...

575
00:39:03,906 --> 00:39:05,212
They're all dead.

576
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:07,432
What?

577
00:39:07,475 --> 00:39:09,738
Ken...

578
00:39:09,782 --> 00:39:12,262
So are you.

579
00:39:12,306 --> 00:39:14,787
What the hell happened out
there?

580
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:17,877
Before I answer... I need to ask
you...

581
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,882
You know about Nexus, right? So
what is it?

582
00:39:22,925 --> 00:39:24,579
You mean the Singularity?

583
00:39:24,623 --> 00:39:27,713
All I've heard is that it's a
super dense energy.

584
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:30,063
The Ken and Nambu
of this world...

585
00:39:30,106 --> 00:39:32,979
They tried analyzing its powers,
to find out what is was.

586
00:39:33,022 --> 00:39:34,894
They were never able
to figure it out.

587
00:39:34,937 --> 00:39:36,896
Where do we start?

588
00:39:36,939 --> 00:39:38,985
It will be difficult to
understand without

589
00:39:39,028 --> 00:39:41,030
first talking about
what the Case is.

590
00:39:41,074 --> 00:39:42,380
Case?

591
00:39:42,423 --> 00:39:45,383
It's a supernatural object
that gives the power

592
00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:47,167
to manipulate possibilities.

593
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,995
It's important to note that...

594
00:39:49,038 --> 00:39:50,910
the Case came from this world.

595
00:39:50,953 --> 00:39:54,000
And eventually the
Case was stolen...

596
00:39:54,043 --> 00:39:56,219
by this dude named Kaido.

597
00:39:56,263 --> 00:39:57,830
Then we came together.

598
00:39:57,873 --> 00:40:00,746
Our group started fighting
Kaido over the Case.

599
00:40:08,057 --> 00:40:10,495
The Case itself was...

600
00:40:10,538 --> 00:40:12,932
endowed with an enormous
amount of energy.

601
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,371
As long as the Case
remained as it was,

602
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,548
that energy kept this
world stable.

603
00:40:20,592 --> 00:40:23,290
But... what happens when you
remove the Case?

604
00:40:26,075 --> 00:40:29,731
Naturally the empty space left
behind becomes unstable.

605
00:40:29,775 --> 00:40:32,952
So it tries to absorb energy
from its surroundings.

606
00:40:32,995 --> 00:40:35,694
That's exactly what happened
here in this world.

607
00:40:35,737 --> 00:40:37,435
The surrounding energy
compensated

608
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:39,480
for the missing Case.

609
00:40:39,524 --> 00:40:43,310
[TAKESHI] In other words, now
you've got this massive clump of

610
00:40:43,353 --> 00:40:46,052
energy sitting there where
the Case used to be.

611
00:40:46,095 --> 00:40:50,317
[JOJI] That's the Singularity...
or what you call the Nexus.

612
00:40:51,405 --> 00:40:53,320
In our computer projections,

613
00:40:53,363 --> 00:40:56,236
the world achieves a state of
equilibrium via a cycle

614
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:58,543
of accumulating and
diffusing energy.

615
00:40:59,761 --> 00:41:02,242
But now we have an abnormality.

616
00:41:02,285 --> 00:41:04,766
Energy that accumulates
perpetually.

617
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:09,423
In this world, they tapped into
the Singularity's energy.

618
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,556
Because it's only
absorbing energy,

619
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,906
it doesn't reach
equilibrium.

620
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:18,824
That constant influx of
energy has warped this

621
00:41:18,867 --> 00:41:20,521
world's gravitational field.

622
00:41:20,565 --> 00:41:23,568
I imagine that's also why those
who are stuck here,

623
00:41:23,611 --> 00:41:26,179
can't return to their
original worlds.

624
00:41:26,701 --> 00:41:29,225
I understand.

625
00:41:29,269 --> 00:41:32,011
It all makes sense now.

626
00:41:32,054 --> 00:41:35,841
It's why this world is teetering
on the brink.

627
00:41:35,884 --> 00:41:37,843
What the hell?

628
00:41:39,975 --> 00:41:42,674
[gasp] What is that?

629
00:41:42,717 --> 00:41:44,676
[JOE] The side effects of Nexus.

630
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:46,939
[TAKESHI] Wait... really?

631
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:50,203
[JOE] Before all this Nexus
business,

632
00:41:50,246 --> 00:41:54,033
this world was under attack by
invaders called Galactor.

633
00:41:54,076 --> 00:41:56,035
[KEN] Galactor? That thing?!

634
00:41:56,078 --> 00:42:00,039
[JOE] I know. It's completely
different from the Galactor

635
00:42:00,082 --> 00:42:02,868
we knew in our world.

636
00:42:02,911 --> 00:42:05,958
Couldn't they simply be
two different entities

637
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:07,699
that share the same name?

638
00:42:07,742 --> 00:42:10,092
With several worlds, it's a
possibility.

639
00:42:10,136 --> 00:42:11,746
Whatever they are...

640
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:16,316
this world's Science Ninja Team
had been battling them for ages.

641
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:18,797
[sigh]

642
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,060
But it didn't matter what we
tried.

643
00:42:21,103 --> 00:42:23,932
Nothing seemed effective against
them.

644
00:42:23,976 --> 00:42:27,545
Until Doctor Nambu had the idea
to turn that mass of energy,

645
00:42:27,588 --> 00:42:30,417
the Nexus, into a weapon.

646
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,681
I'm amazed that kind of thing
was even possible

647
00:42:33,725 --> 00:42:36,989
Well I can tell you...
we knew it would work.

648
00:42:37,032 --> 00:42:40,079
I'm sure that researching
the Singularity...

649
00:42:40,122 --> 00:42:42,647
must've brought about a
technological breakthrough.

650
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:44,823
This isn't only about Nexus.

651
00:42:44,866 --> 00:42:48,000
Apparently, he used Galactor
technology too.

652
00:42:48,043 --> 00:42:51,090
That's what powers the new Bird
Suits you saw.

653
00:42:51,133 --> 00:42:55,616
The thing is though... Nexus
energy comes at a cost.

654
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:58,097
It creates an abnormality
in the world,

655
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,403
each time that it gets used.

656
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:01,753
[gasp]

657
00:43:01,796 --> 00:43:04,364
[JOJI] I suspected as much.

658
00:43:04,407 --> 00:43:06,105
The Singularity's a
concentration

659
00:43:06,148 --> 00:43:07,367
of this world's energy.

660
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:09,848
When that energy has all been
spent...

661
00:43:09,891 --> 00:43:11,589
it causes a shortage elsewhere.

662
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:15,897
Poor bastards...

663
00:43:15,941 --> 00:43:18,900
As you can imagine, Galactor
was totally wiped out...

664
00:43:18,944 --> 00:43:20,467
[gasp]

665
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:23,209
...but in exchange came
catastrophic weather,

666
00:43:23,252 --> 00:43:25,254
hardly any kids were born...

667
00:43:25,298 --> 00:43:28,954
The birth rates hit an all time
low. [sigh]

668
00:43:30,564 --> 00:43:32,044
If it keeps up this way...

669
00:43:32,087 --> 00:43:35,787
it will result in the
death of this world!

670
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:39,529
But you knew that
this was possible?

671
00:43:39,573 --> 00:43:42,228
And we fought it! Ken and I did!

672
00:43:43,446 --> 00:43:50,497
But... but in the end Ken was...

673
00:43:52,499 --> 00:43:55,894
Ken was killed by Nambu.

674
00:43:57,112 --> 00:44:01,508
He killed me? Nambu?!

675
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:05,730
Even with Galactor defeated,
Nambu refused to stop.

676
00:44:07,383 --> 00:44:11,997
And even right now, he's still
exploiting the energy of Nexus.

677
00:44:13,912 --> 00:44:17,655
In the beginning, you had to be
near Nexus to use it.

678
00:44:17,698 --> 00:44:21,180
But now he's got portable tech.

679
00:44:21,223 --> 00:44:25,706
You can charge it and take it
with you like a battery.

680
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:28,578
...Can you imagine what he could
do with that power?

681
00:44:28,622 --> 00:44:30,668
[gasp]

682
00:44:32,408 --> 00:44:36,021
That's why I have to end it once
and for all.

683
00:44:36,978 --> 00:44:39,285
Nambu has to die.

684
00:44:39,328 --> 00:44:41,461
How can you say that?!

685
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:46,292
Where're you going?

686
00:44:47,423 --> 00:44:49,948
I know exactly where he'll be
today.

687
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,779
It's time to settle this.

688
00:44:54,822 --> 00:44:56,781
Joe! Wait!

689
00:44:57,738 --> 00:44:59,044
Joe!

690
00:44:59,087 --> 00:45:01,394
Joe, wait!

691
00:45:01,437 --> 00:45:03,483
Think about where we'd be
without Doctor Nambu

692
00:45:03,526 --> 00:45:05,398
and his support. You
can't just go out-

693
00:45:05,441 --> 00:45:09,054
It isn't him. He's not the
Dr. Nambu we knew.

694
00:45:09,097 --> 00:45:10,664
This is the only way.

695
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,362
Stop it. I won't let you do
this.

696
00:45:13,406 --> 00:45:14,842
Oh, yeah??

697
00:45:14,886 --> 00:45:18,803
Doctor Nambu trained us to fight
for justice! Both of us!

698
00:45:18,846 --> 00:45:20,892
We stand for it.

699
00:45:26,027 --> 00:45:30,075
You sound exactly like
the Ken of this world.

700
00:45:30,118 --> 00:45:32,164
He talked like that
till the end...

701
00:45:33,034 --> 00:45:35,080
'Till he got himself killed.

702
00:45:38,257 --> 00:45:39,911
[gasp]

703
00:45:48,484 --> 00:45:51,531
[NEWSCASTER] This afternoon, a
solemn ceremony is being held

704
00:45:51,574 --> 00:45:54,012
in memory of the victims of
the Galactor invasion.

705
00:45:56,144 --> 00:45:58,277
Peace Park, the site
of the ceremony,

706
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,758
was recently completed inside
the Nexus district's

707
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:02,281
first security area,

708
00:46:02,324 --> 00:46:03,848
where entry is usually
restricted

709
00:46:03,891 --> 00:46:05,284
for ordinary citizens.

710
00:46:09,331 --> 00:46:10,855
People say prayers...

711
00:46:12,073 --> 00:46:14,206
not just for those
they have lost...

712
00:46:14,249 --> 00:46:17,296
but also for themselves.

713
00:46:19,646 --> 00:46:22,823
Having now achieved peace,

714
00:46:22,867 --> 00:46:27,088
what should we turn our
attention to next, hmm?

715
00:46:27,132 --> 00:46:30,222
[struggling grunts]

716
00:46:30,265 --> 00:46:33,225
Should we mourn those we
couldn't save?

717
00:46:33,268 --> 00:46:35,967
Agonize over our helplessness?

718
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:40,798
A well-trodden path, but a
mistaken one.

719
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:43,583
To my mind...

720
00:46:44,671 --> 00:46:47,630
It's anger that we truly
require.

721
00:46:47,674 --> 00:46:49,415
Anger?

722
00:46:51,286 --> 00:46:56,422
We avoided destruction. How long
can that be sustained?

723
00:46:56,465 --> 00:47:00,513
When another enemy like Galactor
appears, I wonder...

724
00:47:00,556 --> 00:47:03,429
will mankind be able
to confront them?

725
00:47:05,213 --> 00:47:07,085
What are you talking about?

726
00:47:07,128 --> 00:47:09,739
Who knows if another
enemy will even come?

727
00:47:09,783 --> 00:47:11,176
[struggling grunts]

728
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:14,005
But when they do, it'll be too
late!

729
00:47:14,048 --> 00:47:15,441
In the meantime...

730
00:47:15,484 --> 00:47:18,444
the people's will to fight must
be carefully nurtured.

731
00:47:20,446 --> 00:47:23,144
What do you mean?

732
00:47:23,188 --> 00:47:27,627
People only stand and fight...
in the face of a threat.

733
00:47:29,977 --> 00:47:33,372
So until a true threat appears
again...

734
00:47:34,242 --> 00:47:35,374
I guess...

735
00:47:35,417 --> 00:47:38,377
I'll just have to play
that part myself.

736
00:47:40,335 --> 00:47:43,295
As far as Nexus energy
weapons are concerned,

737
00:47:43,338 --> 00:47:46,385
this one's on the weaker side.

738
00:47:46,428 --> 00:47:49,954
But it can detect the unique
vibrations of the Galactor

739
00:47:49,997 --> 00:47:51,956
and will fire automatically.

740
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,176
[small gasp]

741
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:57,135
[blows]

742
00:47:58,397 --> 00:47:59,833
Of course...

743
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:05,143
it is only a prototype and those
do tend to malfunction.

744
00:48:05,186 --> 00:48:08,189
Its issues are very well
documented.

745
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:12,237
But as you can see, we lack the
budget to dispose of it,

746
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,412
let alone repair it.

747
00:48:13,455 --> 00:48:17,503
So the whole thing is simply
neglected.

748
00:48:22,725 --> 00:48:25,772
[gasp] My god, you're totally
insane!

749
00:48:25,815 --> 00:48:30,037
You said earlier that you can
"get rid" of Nexus.

750
00:48:30,081 --> 00:48:34,041
Your words... gave me a lot to
think about.

751
00:48:34,085 --> 00:48:38,437
Nexus is a natural phenomenon.
It's existence, fundamental.

752
00:48:39,481 --> 00:48:42,006
To unmake it would be a miracle.

753
00:48:42,049 --> 00:48:44,356
Can you work miracles?

754
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:49,796
If so, go right ahead and try to
stop this.

755
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:55,454
When you do, I'll be more than
happy to make your power my own.

756
00:48:56,716 --> 00:49:00,024
Hey, wait! Wait...!

757
00:49:00,067 --> 00:49:01,939
[struggling grunts]

758
00:49:11,296 --> 00:49:14,777
[EMCEE] And now we ask, if you
are able to stand, please rise.

759
00:49:14,821 --> 00:49:16,954
...Let us pray...

760
00:49:35,015 --> 00:49:37,975
One year ago, The Galactor,

761
00:49:38,018 --> 00:49:41,587
a threat to all mankind,
were defeated.

762
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:45,243
However, for me I would describe
this victory...

763
00:49:45,286 --> 00:49:48,594
as a rather bittersweet
experience.

764
00:49:48,637 --> 00:49:52,641
Even now... that feeling remains
with me.

765
00:49:52,685 --> 00:49:55,862
What is victory?

766
00:49:56,863 --> 00:49:58,952
As you are all aware,

767
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,955
I was the one in charge of the
Science Ninja Team...

768
00:50:04,131 --> 00:50:07,700
Five brave warriors who
protected mankind.

769
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,268
Each one of them faced the
Galactor head on.

770
00:50:10,311 --> 00:50:14,098
Sadly... they all perished.

771
00:50:18,754 --> 00:50:21,279
So with the defeat of Galactor,

772
00:50:21,322 --> 00:50:24,543
those warriors will never
come home to us.

773
00:50:25,848 --> 00:50:28,721
When I lost those
precious comrades.

774
00:50:28,764 --> 00:50:31,028
I knew for me there
could never be,

775
00:50:31,071 --> 00:50:33,291
such a thing as victory.

776
00:50:34,901 --> 00:50:37,208
[sobbing]

777
00:50:38,905 --> 00:50:42,300
And yet, I had to keep going.

778
00:50:42,343 --> 00:50:44,476
I had to keep fighting
no matter what!

779
00:50:45,868 --> 00:50:48,958
So... now I want to
make sure that

780
00:50:49,002 --> 00:50:51,657
no one, including me,

781
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,007
will ever encounter
such loss again!

782
00:50:55,443 --> 00:50:58,229
I promise you!
That's the reason...

783
00:50:58,272 --> 00:51:00,579
the only reason
I seek power!

784
00:51:04,452 --> 00:51:06,585
That menace is gone now, people.

785
00:51:06,628 --> 00:51:09,414
But I continue my research
on Nexus...

786
00:51:09,457 --> 00:51:12,417
and its potential use for
military applications

787
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,593
despite knowing there are
those who voice fierce

788
00:51:14,636 --> 00:51:16,247
opposition to my actions.

789
00:51:18,292 --> 00:51:22,079
[alarm sounding]

790
00:51:22,688 --> 00:51:24,081
[gasp]

791
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:30,739
[struggling grunts]

792
00:51:30,783 --> 00:51:32,001
Do not forget...

793
00:51:32,045 --> 00:51:34,352
When the Galactor first
appeared from space,

794
00:51:34,395 --> 00:51:37,224
we had no warning that
they were coming.

795
00:51:37,268 --> 00:51:41,010
So... what guarantee do
we have that another

796
00:51:41,054 --> 00:51:42,795
such threat will not appear?

797
00:51:42,838 --> 00:51:45,972
You can see our battle is not
over yet.

798
00:51:46,015 --> 00:51:49,280
We must stay strong... and keep
fighting.

799
00:51:49,323 --> 00:51:51,717
As long as we live we cannot
stop fighting!

800
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,547
Power is essential. That's a
fact.

801
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:58,376
But so is the people's will!

802
00:52:05,774 --> 00:52:07,907
You all have gathered
here today...

803
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:10,562
out of the love for those
that we've lost...

804
00:52:10,605 --> 00:52:14,653
However... I must be very frank.

805
00:52:14,696 --> 00:52:17,395
Thinking of those who
are no longer here...

806
00:52:17,438 --> 00:52:18,918
amounts to nothing.

807
00:52:18,961 --> 00:52:24,793
Furthermore, prayer is simply a
means to console oneself.

808
00:52:24,837 --> 00:52:26,186
Let's move on.

809
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:29,668
Let's advance forward and
forge our own future!

811
00:52:41,027 --> 00:52:42,463
I can give you...

812
00:52:42,507 --> 00:52:46,424
each and every single one
of you the power to fight!

00:53:51,706 --> 00:53:53,839
[struggling grunts]

823
00:53:57,538 --> 00:53:59,192
Ken...?

824
00:54:00,367 --> 00:54:01,586
[sigh]

825
00:54:06,721 --> 00:54:08,157
[small grunt]

826
00:54:08,201 --> 00:54:10,812
Hm.

827
00:54:10,856 --> 00:54:11,857
Huh?

828
00:54:15,382 --> 00:54:16,862
Hang on.

829
00:54:16,905 --> 00:54:19,604
A little good luck charm from
yours truly...

830
00:54:22,955 --> 00:54:29,614
[frightened screams]

831
00:54:31,485 --> 00:54:34,532
[DR. NAMBU] There is nothing to
fear!

832
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:37,056
Listen to me.

833
00:54:37,099 --> 00:54:40,059
We only have to unite in
opposition to this threat!

834
00:54:40,102 --> 00:54:44,063
If you have the will, step
forward! Come on!

835
00:54:59,078 --> 00:55:02,386
[gasp]

836
00:55:06,694 --> 00:55:09,088
You don't need any
special training...

837
00:55:09,131 --> 00:55:12,091
nor do you need any techniques
to fight in these suits.

838
00:55:13,788 --> 00:55:16,008
All you need is the desire
to wear them...

839
00:55:16,051 --> 00:55:18,315
and then, the suit
will do the rest.

840
00:55:19,272 --> 00:55:21,274
There are three Galactor.

841
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,407
We'll work in teams of
three to subdue them.

842
00:55:26,366 --> 00:55:29,021
I feel so light!

843
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:34,505
[grunts]

844
00:55:47,822 --> 00:55:51,043
Ken, there's no need to rush in.

845
00:55:51,086 --> 00:55:52,958
They've been kept
frozen in storage.

846
00:55:53,001 --> 00:55:54,873
It drained all of
their strength.

847
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:58,180
Those amateurs'll do fine.

848
00:55:58,224 --> 00:56:00,792
[KEN] Are you sure? Seems risky.

849
00:56:03,751 --> 00:56:06,537
No need to worry-let them have
their fun.

850
00:56:10,889 --> 00:56:13,544
[JOJI] We might be able to use
the advanced wave generator

851
00:56:13,587 --> 00:56:15,546
from Blue Earth's
braking system.

852
00:56:16,982 --> 00:56:18,723
Advanced wave?

853
00:56:18,766 --> 00:56:21,421
Mm. See normally...

854
00:56:21,465 --> 00:56:24,032
a wave moves outward from
its point of origin.

855
00:56:24,076 --> 00:56:26,513
But in contrast,

856
00:56:26,557 --> 00:56:29,995
advanced wave generation moves
in toward its point of origin.

857
00:56:30,038 --> 00:56:33,564
Professor... simplify it for us
will you.

858
00:56:34,782 --> 00:56:37,916
No problem. An advanced wave
cancels out...

859
00:56:37,959 --> 00:56:40,266
a normal wave it collides with.

860
00:56:40,309 --> 00:56:43,443
In Blue Earth, when we executed
the dimensional jump,

861
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:47,578
we used advanced waves to brake
by offsetting our momentum.

862
00:56:47,621 --> 00:56:50,494
We can use a similar method to
block the energy

863
00:56:50,537 --> 00:56:53,366
being supplied by Nexus.

864
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:56,282
[TAKESHI] Sounds good, but how
do we do that?

865
00:56:56,325 --> 00:56:58,719
Those intruders from this
morning are back.

866
00:56:58,763 --> 00:57:03,158
You can use your railguns now,
and you can fire at will.

867
00:57:03,202 --> 00:57:07,119
Ready!? Fire!

868
00:57:07,162 --> 00:57:10,775
[POLIMAR] This time they have
guns and they're using them.

869
00:57:10,818 --> 00:57:12,777
Railguns.

870
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:15,780
Initial velocity Mach 2. They're
not very powerful.

871
00:57:15,823 --> 00:57:18,304
Plus they're using practice
bullets.

872
00:57:18,347 --> 00:57:20,959
It shouldn't penetrate your
Polimar suit.

873
00:57:21,002 --> 00:57:23,614
That is... unless you're at
point-blank range.

874
00:57:23,657 --> 00:57:24,789
[CASSHAN] Professor...

875
00:57:24,832 --> 00:57:26,921
Tetsuya that goes for you as
well.

876
00:57:26,965 --> 00:57:28,401
[loud sound]

877
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,621
[CASSHAN] Yeah, that's pretty
strong.

878
00:57:30,664 --> 00:57:32,623
[POLIMAR] Hey, dummy, he said be
careful!

879
00:57:32,666 --> 00:57:35,669
We don't know enough about Nexus
yet...

880
00:57:35,713 --> 00:57:39,194
...how it supplies energy to the
Bird Suits. It's a mystery.

881
00:57:39,238 --> 00:57:40,805
[attack grunt]

882
00:57:40,848 --> 00:57:42,720
[JOJI] However... when it does,

883
00:57:42,763 --> 00:57:45,070
it ends up warping the
gravitational field.

884
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:48,813
...Considering that, we
can have the computer

885
00:57:48,856 --> 00:57:51,163
create a theoretical model
of the energy waves.

886
00:57:55,297 --> 00:57:58,910
In other words, we use the shape
of the vessel to predict...

887
00:57:58,953 --> 00:58:00,302
what's inside?

888
00:58:00,346 --> 00:58:02,479
Precisely.

889
00:58:06,265 --> 00:58:10,269
[attack grunts]

890
00:58:16,623 --> 00:58:19,104
[fearful gasp]

891
00:58:21,715 --> 00:58:24,283
Tsk. He's too nice.

892
00:58:25,197 --> 00:58:26,503
[grunt]

893
00:58:46,218 --> 00:58:48,525
It's Gatchaman!

894
00:58:48,568 --> 00:58:50,527
I thought he was killed by
Galactor!

895
00:58:53,442 --> 00:58:57,621
[gasp] That's not the real
Gatchaman, dammit!

896
00:58:57,664 --> 00:58:59,623
He's an invader from
another world.

897
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:01,320
Stay back, he's dangerous!

898
00:59:06,586 --> 00:59:08,545

[panting]

900
00:59:14,768 --> 00:59:16,814
Use your railguns on them!

901
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,296
But we shouldn't just execute
them!

902
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:24,256
[groan] AI Center,

903
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:27,433
set the new recruits Bird
Suits to full-auto.

904
00:59:27,476 --> 00:59:31,698
And then Set G1 and G2 as the
main targets.

905
00:59:31,742 --> 00:59:35,659
What's happening?! My body's
moving... on its own!

00:59:46,234 --> 00:59:50,412
Doctor, N-Mode is down.

908
00:59:50,456 --> 00:59:52,458
What!?

909
00:59:52,501 --> 00:59:55,853
[JOJI] Ken, I've initiated
advanced wave generation.

910
00:59:55,896 --> 00:59:57,202
It's just like we thought:

911
00:59:57,245 --> 00:59:59,726
The energy supply has
been obstructed.

912
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:01,772
Within two minutes, it will stop
completely.

913
01:00:03,382 --> 01:00:05,123
The cause is unknown.

914
01:00:05,166 --> 01:00:08,387
Nexus is sending energy at a
normal rate.

915
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:11,608
But somewhere along the line,
the energy is being drained.

916
01:00:11,651 --> 01:00:12,870
Huh?

917
01:00:12,913 --> 01:00:16,874
[grunts]

918
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:21,618
[nervous gasps]

919
01:00:21,661 --> 01:00:25,230
Cut out the energy feed
immediately.

920
01:00:25,273 --> 01:00:27,406
If you cooperate, you will not
be harmed!

921
01:00:31,323 --> 01:00:32,716

01:00:53,345 --> 01:00:54,912
Let go.

927
01:00:54,955 --> 01:00:56,914
Don't kill him.

928
01:00:56,957 --> 01:00:59,307
You know that's not the way that
we do things.

929
01:00:59,351 --> 01:01:00,744
I don't care.

930
01:01:00,787 --> 01:01:02,920
You should care...

931
01:01:04,443 --> 01:01:06,010
Kids are watching.

932
01:01:08,229 --> 01:01:11,189
Protecting the people is the
duty of a hero.

933
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:15,672
Don't lose sight of what is
right!

934
01:01:18,413 --> 01:01:23,027
This is why you're the leader.

935
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:25,856
[SASAOKA] I have no time for
your personal grudges,

936
01:01:25,899 --> 01:01:27,466
Joe the Condor.

937
01:01:27,509 --> 01:01:31,557
I shouldn't have to remind you,
your job was to secure Nambu.

938
01:01:32,471 --> 01:01:33,951
Who are you?

939
01:01:33,994 --> 01:01:35,126
[JOE] She's my boss.

940
01:01:35,169 --> 01:01:36,562
[GATCHAMAN] Huh?

941
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:39,565
I'm a government
representative.

942
01:01:39,608 --> 01:01:41,785
But I can't tell you
for which country.

943
01:01:41,828 --> 01:01:43,787
I'm here to carry
out a resolution

944
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:45,397
from the United Nations.

945
01:01:46,528 --> 01:01:48,313
With Nexus in Nambu's control,

946
01:01:48,356 --> 01:01:50,445
I could only wait
for him to stumble.

947
01:01:50,489 --> 01:01:51,795
[grunt]

948
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:54,580
But I would never have imagined
this.

949
01:01:55,494 --> 01:01:56,495
Oh I see...

950
01:01:58,627 --> 01:02:02,327
You were only helping
Joe in order to stop me.

951
01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:05,069
I figured working with her would
give me the best odds.

952
01:02:05,112 --> 01:02:06,810
Looks like I was right.

953
01:02:06,853 --> 01:02:09,073
Dr. Nambu...

954
01:02:09,116 --> 01:02:11,510
At an emergency board
meeting this morning,

955
01:02:11,553 --> 01:02:14,078
your removal from
office was decided.

956
01:02:14,121 --> 01:02:17,081
They're currently getting final
authorization.

957
01:02:18,647 --> 01:02:23,435
I guess that explains the Prime
Minister's absence.

958
01:02:23,478 --> 01:02:25,567
Your cohorts in these
illegal activities

959
01:02:25,611 --> 01:02:28,353
will be dismissed, too.

960
01:02:28,396 --> 01:02:31,530
Listen up! You have a new
commanding officer now.

961
01:02:34,054 --> 01:02:36,622
We are taking Nambu into
custody...

962
01:02:36,665 --> 01:02:39,407
with the consent of the
Japanese government.

963
01:02:39,451 --> 01:02:42,280
Understood.

[long exhale]

966
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:33,461
It looks like there nothing's
happening.

967
01:03:33,505 --> 01:03:35,463
[small exhale]

968
01:03:35,507 --> 01:03:38,423
I don't get it.

969
01:03:38,466 --> 01:03:44,081
If I had to guestimate...
there's not enough power.

970
01:03:44,124 --> 01:03:46,344
What? Are you kidding me?

971
01:03:46,387 --> 01:03:49,347
C'mon, are you serious? It ran
out of power?

972
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:51,436
So something's changed since
Kaido?

973
01:03:51,479 --> 01:03:54,700
The original power of the Case
was scattered back then.

974
01:03:56,049 --> 01:03:58,182
Only fragments remained with
Emi.

975
01:03:58,225 --> 01:04:01,359
Actually it's something more
like echoes.

976
01:04:01,402 --> 01:04:03,840
Yes but... when I was back in my
own world...

977
01:04:03,883 --> 01:04:05,537
Emi-it can create
miracles but...

978
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:07,974
but only in your original world.

979
01:04:08,018 --> 01:04:11,108
For now, that's the extent of
the Case's power.

980
01:04:11,151 --> 01:04:13,762
Then that means...

981
01:04:13,806 --> 01:04:17,941
There's no way to undo this.

982
01:04:17,984 --> 01:04:22,032
[groan] Let's think!

983
01:04:22,075 --> 01:04:23,860
There's got to be a way.

984
01:04:26,601 --> 01:04:29,213
What if we destroy the device
extracting energy

985
01:04:29,256 --> 01:04:30,475
from the Singularity?

986
01:04:30,518 --> 01:04:34,044
Yeah but... that'd be a
temporary fix at best.

987
01:04:34,087 --> 01:04:36,568
Energy is no longer being
extracted.

988
01:04:36,611 --> 01:04:39,963
So if the energy flowing in
starts to fill it up

989
01:04:40,006 --> 01:04:41,094
and stays there,

990
01:04:41,138 --> 01:04:43,227
the Singularity will
begin to diffuse.

991
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:46,491
And then it's possible....

992
01:04:46,534 --> 01:04:48,972
It might become small enough
for Emi to extinguish.

993
01:04:50,669 --> 01:04:52,497
Let's hope so.

994
01:04:55,021 --> 01:04:58,764
You went too far. I warned you.

995
01:04:58,807 --> 01:05:01,854
You could've taken
a different path.

996
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:05,162
You could've used Nexus to
create other military weapons,

997
01:05:05,205 --> 01:05:07,425
like the one that brought
down Galactor.

998
01:05:07,468 --> 01:05:10,819
But instead you focused on
creating a more versatile

999
01:05:10,863 --> 01:05:12,647
Bird Suit for mass-production.

1000
01:05:12,691 --> 01:05:14,693
And why?

1001
01:05:15,999 --> 01:05:18,610
Because the threat you
were envisioning...

1002
01:05:18,653 --> 01:05:21,352
always included
humans beings.

1003
01:05:21,395 --> 01:05:24,007
Sleek, mobile suits were the
perfect choice...

1004
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:27,010
for counteracting an
invading force.

1005
01:05:27,053 --> 01:05:29,273
And I suppose...

1006
01:05:29,316 --> 01:05:33,364
just as useful if you are to
side with the invaders.

1007
01:05:33,407 --> 01:05:35,453
You are a frightening man.

1008
01:05:35,496 --> 01:05:38,195
Did you actually think other
nations would ignore

1009
01:05:38,238 --> 01:05:39,196
someone like you?

1010
01:05:51,251 --> 01:05:52,818
My country however...

1011
01:05:52,861 --> 01:05:55,299

with you right now.

1012
01:05:55,342 --> 01:05:58,911
Without... UN involvement.

1013
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:02,175
So you want a part of the
profits then?

1014
01:06:02,219 --> 01:06:05,787
It's not fair for one country to
have all the power, is it?

1015
01:06:05,831 --> 01:06:07,789
A deterrent is necessary.

1016
01:06:07,833 --> 01:06:10,488
That's my line.

1017
01:06:10,531 --> 01:06:14,492
Do you want to remain locked up
for the rest of your life?

1018
01:06:14,535 --> 01:06:17,495
Or will you accept our
proposition?

1019
01:06:17,538 --> 01:06:20,933
It's a rather simple question.

1020
01:06:22,369 --> 01:06:25,982
My wish has always been to
strengthen mankind.

1021
01:06:27,026 --> 01:06:30,334
Your proposition is beneath me.

1022
01:06:30,377 --> 01:06:32,597
You can't sacrifice
other countries and

1023
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,164
take the moral
high ground.

1024

to have real power.

Well, they must accept the
responsibility to wield it.

in that Bird Run now?

1147
01:16:19,357 --> 01:16:20,663
Huh?

01:16:29,062 --> 01:16:30,586

01:16:33,719 --> 01:16:36,330

01:17:32,343 --> 01:17:34,475
Get back!

01:17:34,519 --> 01:17:36,347
[panting]

1167
01:17:37,870 --> 01:17:41,091
[grunt] Get back here!

1168
01:17:41,134 --> 01:17:42,832
Joe! Hold up!

1169
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:44,094

[grunt]

1172
01:18:02,765 --> 01:18:05,550
The Singularity's energy is
dropping fast.

1173
01:18:06,638 --> 01:18:08,161
What should we do now?

1174
01:18:08,205 --> 01:18:09,772
It's been reset.

1175
01:18:09,815 --> 01:18:12,122
But as it reaches
its equilibrium,

1176
01:18:12,165 --> 01:18:14,690
it'll cause a massive
counter-current.

1177
01:18:14,733 --> 01:18:17,214
Wasn't that the original idea?

1178
01:18:17,257 --> 01:18:20,783
No. The energy flow is too
rapid.

1179
01:18:20,826 --> 01:18:23,394
Okay... What does that mean?

1180
01:18:23,437 --> 01:18:27,572
Too great an energy flow... will
drain the surrounding area.

1181
01:18:33,796 --> 01:18:37,538
At this rate, the entirety of
Shibuya will be drained.

1182
01:18:37,582 --> 01:18:39,192
It'll crumble to ash.

1183
01:18:39,236 --> 01:18:41,978
Is there anything we can do?

1184
01:18:42,021 --> 01:18:46,243
[JOJI] This kind of reset should
only be temporary.

1185
01:18:46,286 --> 01:18:50,421
...We just have to ride it
out...

1186
01:18:50,464 --> 01:18:53,250
What about that building that
was hit by the Nexus weapon?

1187
01:18:53,293 --> 01:18:56,470
There might still be some people
at the ceremony site.

1188
01:18:56,514 --> 01:18:58,342

[NAMBU] [Groan]

1196
01:19:31,984 --> 01:19:34,465
This better end right now.

1197
01:19:41,428 --> 01:19:44,214
The only thing we received in
exchange for his release

1198
01:19:44,257 --> 01:19:45,563
are these guns.

1199
01:19:45,606 --> 01:19:48,000
[SASAOKA] We're far from done
with him.

1200
01:19:48,044 --> 01:19:51,134
...So the best thing you can do
is put down your weapon.

1201
01:19:51,177 --> 01:19:52,831
So that's how it is.

1202
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:56,879
You wanted Nexus all along from
the very beginning.

1203
01:19:58,706 --> 01:20:01,579
Dr. Nambu is currently
the only one...

1204
01:20:01,622 --> 01:20:05,148
who knows how to convert
energy from Nexus.

1205
01:20:05,191 --> 01:20:07,846
The world will slide into
chaos without him.

1206
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:09,979
Letting him live is
the right thing to do.

1207
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:13,809
It's always the same old thing.

1208
01:20:13,852 --> 01:20:18,161
Humans can't help but lust for
power.

1209
01:20:22,295 --> 01:20:25,821
"The right thing to do"
Really?

1210
01:20:29,433 --> 01:20:31,000
[small chuckle]

1211
01:20:35,787 --> 01:20:37,702
That's not my style.

Hey Joe, is that you?

1222
01:21:35,673 --> 01:21:37,675
You okay?

1223
01:21:42,767 --> 01:21:44,160
Joe!

1224
01:21:48,512 --> 01:21:51,428
Joe...

1225
01:21:54,039 --> 01:21:55,998
Hey...!

1226
01:21:56,041 --> 01:21:59,262
[dying breaths]

1227
01:22:00,437 --> 01:22:02,004
Why, Joe?

[gasp]

1229
01:22:10,403 --> 01:22:12,928
[JOE] Still... shining...

01:22:18,411 --> 01:22:20,544
Hang on...! Joe!

[GATCHAMAN] Joe...!

1233
01:22:24,287 --> 01:22:26,550

[angry scream]

1236
01:22:49,616 --> 01:22:52,706
[JOJI] You're really going to
stay here in this world?

1237
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:55,100
[KEN] Yeah.

1238
01:22:55,144 --> 01:22:59,409
The Nexus is still here. So I
can't leave now.

1239
01:22:59,452 --> 01:23:01,193
The doctor may no longer be
around,

1240
01:23:01,237 --> 01:23:04,675
but eventually someone'll show
up who wants it for evil.

1241
01:23:04,718 --> 01:23:10,202
That's cool then. I suppose
someone ought to be guarding it.

1242
01:23:10,246 --> 01:23:14,076
The device draining the world of
energy is finally gone now.

1243
01:23:15,555 --> 01:23:18,602
[JOJI] From now on, it'll be an
easy ebb and flow.

1244
01:23:19,907 --> 01:23:22,345
[JOJI] Over time it will
stabilize.

1245
01:23:22,388 --> 01:23:26,175
But... realistically that
could take many years.

1246
01:23:30,657 --> 01:23:33,878
Once people here can
live in peace

1247
01:23:33,921 --> 01:23:37,621
and the Nexus can finally
be eliminated...

1248
01:23:37,664 --> 01:23:41,059
Then I'll return to my world.

1249
01:23:41,103 --> 01:23:44,280
Alright. We'll keep an eye on
your home world for ya,

1250
01:23:44,323 --> 01:23:46,195
until you're ready
to get back there.

1251
01:23:47,152 --> 01:23:48,545
Yeah?

1252
01:23:49,502 --> 01:23:51,635
We'll take good care of it.

1253
01:23:53,724 --> 01:23:55,030
Thank you.

1254
01:23:57,336 --> 01:24:00,296
[TAKESHI] Emi! Hey, this is
goodbye ya know.

1255
01:24:00,339 --> 01:24:03,038
Don't you want to
say anything to us?

1256
01:24:04,517 --> 01:24:05,997
I hate that stuff.

1257
01:24:09,174 --> 01:24:11,481
And why are you
always like this?

1258
01:24:11,524 --> 01:24:14,005
Why do you have to do all
the heavy lifting?

1259
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:17,052
You never ask for help. It's
really annoying.

1260
01:24:17,095 --> 01:24:19,054
[chuckling]

1261
01:24:20,925 --> 01:24:24,407

01:24:29,194 --> 01:24:31,501
[happy sigh]

1264
01:24:35,113 --> 01:24:36,854
[KEN] You'll see.

1265
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:49,388
[gasps in amazement]

1266
01:24:49,432 --> 01:24:52,043
[NEWSCASTER] It's been nearly
three months since the incident

1267
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:54,872
caused by Kozaburo Nambu
and the Ministry's

1268
01:24:54,915 --> 01:24:58,136
announcement shortly afterwards
about the elimination of Nexus.

1269
01:24:58,180 --> 01:25:00,269
Despite knowing the dangers
posed by Nexus,

1270
01:25:00,312 --> 01:25:02,532
they allowed Nambu
to have sole authority

1271
01:25:02,575 --> 01:25:03,837
over its management.

1272
01:25:03,881 --> 01:25:06,536
As to the responsibility of
the government...

Are you going to kill me? Tell
me now.

01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:45,009
Heh. That's just not how I
operate.
