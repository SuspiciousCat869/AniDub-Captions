00:20:24.738 --> 00:20:26.706 position:10% line:89% align:start
it would take my breath away.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.175 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mmm...

00:20:28.209 --> 00:20:31.812 position:38% line:83% align:start
-(laughs)
-(yelping)

00:20:31.846 --> 00:20:33.747 position:5% line:89% align:start
One more question for you, Gene.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.716 position:19% line:83% align:start
Out of all the scenes,
which one did you like the best?

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:38.618 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh, easy.

00:20:38.651 --> 00:20:40.254 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's the one where Lily
is singing

00:20:40.287 --> 00:20:41.822 position:30% line:83% align:start
and then looks
over her shoulder.

00:20:41.856 --> 00:20:44.191 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh. That was a quick answer.

00:20:44.225 --> 00:20:45.759 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, it's the moment
when D'Albert

00:20:45.793 --> 00:20:47.727 position:30% line:83% align:start
finally regains
his passion for music.

00:20:47.761 --> 00:20:49.797 position:16% line:89% align:start
And also when I read it,

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.866 position:33% line:83% align:start
man, I could
picture it immediately.

00:20:53.167 --> 00:20:55.102 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hmm. You have passed.

00:20:55.136 --> 00:20:57.238 position:10% line:89% align:start
However, looking through it,

00:20:57.271 --> 00:20:59.907 position:7% line:83% align:start
most of these scenes only have
two actors in them,

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:03.010 position:5% line:83% align:start
which means you're going to have
to cast really strong actors.

00:21:03.044 --> 00:21:06.347 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's already cast. We offered
D'Albert to Martin Braddock,

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.182 position:24% line:89% align:start
and he's accepted.

00:21:08.215 --> 00:21:10.717 position:16% line:89% align:start
What? M-Martin Braddock?

00:21:11.886 --> 00:21:15.089 position:16% line:83% align:start
But he's a legend,
the best actor ever!

00:21:15.122 --> 00:21:18.292 position:13% line:89% align:start
Uh, wait, didn't he retire?

00:21:18.325 --> 00:21:21.328 position:13% line:83% align:start
He no longer felt inspired,
so he got more picky

00:21:21.362 --> 00:21:24.597 position:7% line:83% align:start
and hasn't said yes to anything
for ten years.

00:21:24.631 --> 00:21:26.233 position:21% line:83% align:start
That is, until I got
Grandpa to convince him.

00:21:26.267 --> 00:21:28.202 position:44% line:83% align:start
GENE:
Wow.

00:21:28.235 --> 00:21:31.005 position:16% line:83% align:start
POMPO: Martin Braddock's
first film in ten years.

00:21:31.038 --> 00:21:32.772 position:13% line:89% align:start
That'll make for great PR.

00:21:32.807 --> 00:21:35.209 position:24% line:83% align:start
This movie's gonna
be a hit now for sure.

00:21:35.242 --> 00:21:37.777 position:7% line:83% align:start
-And for Lily, we're casting...
-(door opens)

00:21:37.812 --> 00:21:40.114 position:16% line:83% align:start
-NATALIE: Um, excuse me.
-Oh? Yes. Right on cue.

00:21:40.147 --> 00:21:41.748 position:44% line:83% align:start
GENE:
Huh?

00:21:41.782 --> 00:21:43.851 position:27% line:83% align:start
I got my hair cut
just like you asked me to.

00:21:43.884 --> 00:21:45.853 position:35% line:89% align:start
How is it?

00:21:45.886 --> 00:21:48.956 position:27% line:83% align:start
POMPO: Ooh, nice.
It really suits you, Natalie.

00:21:48.989 --> 00:21:51.058 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:21:51.092 --> 00:21:53.794 position:35% line:83% align:start
-(screams)
-(gasps)

00:21:53.828 --> 00:21:56.763 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's-it's Lily!
I'm staring right at Lily!

00:21:56.797 --> 00:21:58.631 position:38% line:83% align:start
-I know.
-NATALIE: Huh? Huh?

00:21:58.665 --> 00:22:00.835 position:30% line:83% align:start
She's perfect.
Because I wrote it for her.

00:22:00.868 --> 00:22:03.070 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's why... Oh.

00:22:03.104 --> 00:22:05.239 position:30% line:83% align:start
The first time
I set eyes on her,

00:22:05.272 --> 00:22:07.074 position:13% line:89% align:start
 <i>I caught a glimmer of it.</i>

00:22:07.108 --> 00:22:10.978 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>A scene awash with a brilliant,</i>
 <i>beautiful light.</i>

00:22:11.011 --> 00:22:13.314 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>And so, in order to try</i>

00:22:13.347 --> 00:22:15.015 position:35% line:83% align:start
 <i>to capture</i>
 <i>that brief flash of light,</i>

00:22:15.049 --> 00:22:16.350 position:21% line:89% align:start
 <i>I wrote this script.</i>

00:22:17.318 --> 00:22:19.053 position:24% line:89% align:start
So then, sometimes,

00:22:19.086 --> 00:22:21.856 position:24% line:83% align:start
scripts are written
for specific actors?

00:22:21.889 --> 00:22:24.724 position:10% line:83% align:start
Occasionally, an entire story
will unfold in your mind

00:22:24.757 --> 00:22:26.327 position:33% line:83% align:start
when you meet
that special someone.

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.028 position:7% line:89% align:start
Generally speaking, that means

00:22:28.062 --> 00:22:30.197 position:13% line:83% align:start
you have a fantastic movie
on your hands.

00:22:30.231 --> 00:22:33.000 position:41% line:83% align:start
-I see.
-NATALIE: Um, excuse me,

00:22:33.033 --> 00:22:36.303 position:16% line:83% align:start
but can you explain to me
what you two are talking about?

00:22:36.337 --> 00:22:39.173 position:41% line:83% align:start
POMPO:
I shall enlighten.

00:22:39.206 --> 00:22:41.842 position:10% line:83% align:start
Congratulations on being cast
in your first movie.

00:22:41.876 --> 00:22:44.011 position:38% line:89% align:start
Huh? Aah!

00:22:44.044 --> 00:22:47.214 position:10% line:83% align:start
W-W-W-Wait! All of a sudden?
H-H-H-How did this happen?

00:22:47.248 --> 00:22:49.083 position:19% line:77% align:start
-I don't believe this!
-Here you go.
-GENE: Huh?

00:22:49.116 --> 00:22:51.684 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm going to let you
shoot this screenplay of mine.

00:22:51.718 --> 00:22:54.355 position:10% line:89% align:start
Best of luck, director Gene.

00:22:54.388 --> 00:22:57.892 position:27% line:89% align:start
(gasps, screams)

00:23:07.935 --> 00:23:10.471 position:10% line:83% align:start
I apologize, but we're doing
some construction up ahead.

00:23:10.504 --> 00:23:12.705 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh, understood.

00:23:12.739 --> 00:23:15.943 position:38% line:83% align:start
This way.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

00:23:15.976 --> 00:23:17.411 position:41% line:89% align:start

00:23:19.413 --> 00:23:21.982 position:21% line:89% align:start
Uh, excuse me. Whoa!

00:23:23.817 --> 00:23:26.854 position:13% line:89% align:start
No, no, no, I can't sleep.

00:23:26.887 --> 00:23:30.925 position:19% line:83% align:start

I can only afford
once every two weeks.

From now on,
you'll be her apprentice.

You will shadow her every day.

00:26:00.307 --> 00:26:02.276 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll call her later

00:26:02.309 --> 00:26:05.279 position:27% line:83% align:start
You will receive
the same exact training as her,

Yes. Of course you may.

00:31:18.893 --> 00:31:21.929 position:10% line:83% align:start
Since this is your first film
and Martin is your star,

00:31:21.963 --> 00:31:24.765 position:13% line:83% align:start
it means you're going to be
under a whole lot of pressure.

00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:26.500 position:7% line:89% align:start
If you try to please everyone,

00:31:26.533 --> 00:31:29.202 position:16% line:83% align:start
your movie's going to be
a directionless mess.

00:31:29.236 --> 00:31:30.938 position:13% line:89% align:start
But here's how to fix that.

00:31:30.972 --> 00:31:33.340 position:24% line:83% align:start
All you have to do
is think about the one person

00:31:33.373 --> 00:31:34.976 position:10% line:83% align:start
you want to show the movie to
the most.

00:31:35.009 --> 00:31:36.677 position:13% line:83% align:start
And as long as you make it
for them,

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:38.880 position:19% line:83% align:start
your movie will end up
with a laser-sharp focus.

00:31:38.913 --> 00:31:41.281 position:27% line:89% align:start
That makes sense.

00:31:41.314 --> 00:31:43.450 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've been pretty worried
about screwing it all up,

00:31:43.483 --> 00:31:45.519 position:21% line:89% align:start

00:32:11.645 --> 00:32:13.981 position:30% line:83% align:start

-Yes.

00:32:23.991 --> 00:32:27.795 position:19% line:83% align:start
Is it weird to have me
playing your female lead?

00:32:27.829 --> 00:32:30.363 position:5% line:89% align:start
Maybe I'm not attractive enough.

00:32:30.397 --> 00:32:34.735 position:41% line:83% align:start

I-I'm so nervous about this

that part of me
wants to run away.

00:32:36.904 --> 00:32:39.006 position:13% line:89% align:start
But when I think about it,

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.742 position:16% line:83% align:start

She said, as long as

you've nothing to worry about

what she tells you to?

00:59:17.438 --> 00:59:22.943 position:10% line:83% align:start
Through them, you experienced
empathy, dreams, longing.

01:03:09.169 --> 01:03:11.438 position:21% line:83% align:start
And getting your cast
to come back

01:03:11.471 --> 01:03:13.173 position:10% line:89% align:start
is an even bigger nightmare.

Who do you think
negotiates that, huh, Gene?

01:03:15.509 --> 01:03:16.643 position:33% line:89% align:start
You do, miss.

01:03:16.677 --> 01:03:18.579 position:5% line:89% align:start
Lastly, who wrote the screenplay

01:03:18.612 --> 01:03:20.113 position:33% line:83% align:start
that you feel
is missing a scene?

01:03:20.147 --> 01:03:22.516 position:30% line:83% align:start
-You did, miss.
-Now I ask you again,

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:25.752 position:13% line:83% align:start
are you telling me you want
to do additional shooting?

01:03:26.788 --> 01:03:27.654 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

01:03:31.525 --> 01:03:34.194 position:19% line:83% align:start

I think it's insane.

01:03:34.227 --> 01:03:36.697 position:10% line:83% align:start
You actually want to attempt
that aria again?

01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:46.640 position:21% line:83% align:start
D'Albert, you're only
embarrassing yourself.

01:03:46.673 --> 01:03:48.508 position:19% line:89% align:start
I never understood it.

01:03:48.542 --> 01:03:50.577 position:7% line:89% align:start
No. I'd somehow forgotten it--

01:03:50.611 --> 01:03:52.779 position:24% line:89% align:start
 <i>the smell of fish</i>

01:03:52.814 --> 01:03:54.816 position:35% line:83% align:start

01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:01.388 position:24% line:83% align:start

They're important,

01:04:01.421 --> 01:04:03.323 position:24% line:83% align:start

reminded me of that.

01:06:41.414 --> 01:06:44.051 position:16% line:83% align:start

Huh.

01:06:45.853 --> 01:06:48.956 position:10% line:5% align:start

01:08:32.827 --> 01:08:36.496 position:5% line:89% align:start

(typing)

01:09:03.757 --> 01:09:07.028 position:24% line:83% align:start
And so, I recommend
that we invest in <i>Meister.</i>

01:09:07.061 --> 01:09:10.965 position:10% line:83% align:start
(sighs) Even with a big star
like Martin attached,

01:09:10.998 --> 01:09:12.166 position:24% line:89% align:start
the director's new.

01:09:12.199 --> 01:09:13.901 position:16% line:89% align:start
It also doesn't bode well

01:09:13.935 --> 01:09:15.635 position:19% line:83% align:start
that the film's gotten
bad press,

01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:17.872 position:16% line:83% align:start
which makes it too risky
in my book.

01:09:17.905 --> 01:09:19.006 position:19% line:89% align:start
I vote we don't invest.

(sighs)

01:09:23.210 --> 01:09:24.744 position:7% line:89% align:start

01:10:50.965 --> 01:10:53.666 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>what was it that drew her</i>
 <i>to the movies?</i>

01:10:55.269 --> 01:10:57.704 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>And had she never been</i>
 <i>so engrossed in a film</i>

01:10:57.737 --> 01:10:59.773 position:16% line:83% align:start

 <i>had rolled?</i>

01:11:06.113 --> 01:11:07.815 position:19% line:89% align:start
 <i>When I think about it,</i>

01:11:07.848 --> 01:11:10.184 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>it's the reason I wanted</i>
 <i>to make a movie myself.</i>

01:11:11.218 --> 01:11:13.988 position:27% line:89% align:start
 <i>Movies saved me.</i>

01:11:14.021 --> 01:11:17.158 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>So maybe someone else</i>
 <i>will be saved by mine.</i>

01:11:19.026 --> 01:11:22.329 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>And then I finally saw it--</i>
 <i>myself in the movie.</i>

01:11:23.964 --> 01:11:25.866 position:30% line:89% align:start
 <i>This movie...</i>

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:28.169 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>I made it for the me</i>
 <i>all those years ago.</i>

01:11:29.769 --> 01:11:31.806 position:21% line:89% align:start
 <i>No, not just for me.</i>

 <i>I see.</i>

01:11:42.850 --> 01:11:45.019 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>It needed a character</i>
 <i>that everyone can identify with.</i>

01:11:45.052 --> 01:11:47.021 position:33% line:83% align:start
 <i>Someone who,</i>
 <i>no matter who watches it,</i>

 <i>can believe in.</i>

01:11:49.056 --> 01:11:50.391 position:44% line:83% align:start
GENE:
It's what helped me realize

01:11:50.424 --> 01:11:53.693 position:13% line:83% align:start
that the movie was lacking
a very important scene.

01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:55.830 position:16% line:83% align:start
One little crucial scene
it required

01:11:55.863 --> 01:11:57.198 position:16% line:83% align:start
that would make the movie
complete.

01:11:59.166 --> 01:12:01.035 position:16% line:89% align:start
To show what we sacrifice

01:12:01.068 --> 01:12:03.170 position:24% line:83% align:start
in order to be able
to pursue our dreams.

01:12:03.204 --> 01:12:05.172 position:24% line:89% align:start
 <i>And so I beg you,</i>

01:12:05.206 --> 01:12:07.308 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>please make my dreams come true.</i>

01:12:10.211 --> 01:12:12.847 position:19% line:83% align:start
ALAN: You know, things
always came naturally,

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:15.648 position:7% line:83% align:start
and I succeeded at everything,
or so I thought.

01:12:15.682 --> 01:12:17.351 position:16% line:89% align:start
But, looking back at it,

01:12:17.384 --> 01:12:19.253 position:21% line:83% align:start
what have I actually
accomplished?

01:12:19.286 --> 01:12:21.688 position:10% line:83% align:start
What's the point of anything
if it doesn't have meaning?

01:12:21.721 --> 01:12:24.757 position:30% line:83% align:start
And once I came
to that realization,

01:12:24.792 --> 01:12:27.694 position:21% line:83% align:start
I knew I had to find
something for myself.

01:12:27.727 --> 01:12:30.064 position:35% line:83% align:start
I ask you,
what is a banker's job really

01:12:30.097 --> 01:12:32.933 position:7% line:83% align:start
if not to give people the means
to fulfill their dreams?

01:12:32.967 --> 01:12:34.667 position:35% line:89% align:start
So please!

01:12:34.701 --> 01:12:36.837 position:19% line:83% align:start
We want to make a movie
that will give people

01:12:36.871 --> 01:12:39.440 position:19% line:83% align:start
who have nothing a way
to keep on dreaming!

01:12:39.473 --> 01:12:42.843 position:10% line:89% align:start
(song continues in Japanese)

01:12:42.877 --> 01:12:45.112 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'll admit,
I agree with what you've said.

01:12:45.146 --> 01:12:48.082 position:30% line:83% align:start
That is exactly
what bankers ought to do.

01:12:48.115 --> 01:12:51.085 position:13% line:83% align:start
But we can't make decisions
based on philosophy.

01:12:51.118 --> 01:12:53.686 position:19% line:83% align:start
You need to convince us
with concrete figures,

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:54.955 position:19% line:89% align:start
not just nice stories.

01:12:56.123 --> 01:12:58.092 position:44% line:83% align:start
ALAN:
Figures.

01:12:58.125 --> 01:12:59.960 position:10% line:89% align:start
(song continues in Japanese)

01:13:04.899 --> 01:13:07.700 position:10% line:83% align:start
-ALAN: I have those figures.
-You do?

01:13:10.237 --> 01:13:12.940 position:33% line:83% align:start
-What's this?
-You've been filming us?

01:13:12.973 --> 01:13:15.142 position:30% line:83% align:start
I do apologize,
but not only that,

01:13:15.176 --> 01:13:17.945 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've been streaming this
entire meeting worldwide.

01:13:17.978 --> 01:13:19.280 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-What?

01:13:25.486 --> 01:13:28.088 position:24% line:83% align:start
Our documentary is
also available online.

01:13:28.122 --> 01:13:30.090 position:30% line:89% align:start
What's more...

01:13:30.124 --> 01:13:31.859 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're crowdfunding it?

01:13:31.892 --> 01:13:33.994 position:19% line:83% align:start
ALAN: We launched this
website a few days ago.

01:13:34.028 --> 01:13:36.964 position:13% line:83% align:start
This was how much we raised
on the very first day,

01:13:36.997 --> 01:13:39.400 position:16% line:89% align:start
and this is the fund now.

01:13:39.433 --> 01:13:42.436 position:24% line:83% align:start
And the campaign is
approaching two million views.

01:13:43.871 --> 01:13:45.406 position:38% line:89% align:start
(groans)

01:13:49.376 --> 01:13:52.379 position:24% line:83% align:start
So, how do you like
those figures?

01:13:54.114 --> 01:13:57.151 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now, that's the conclusion
of my presentation.

01:13:58.319 --> 01:14:00.120 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hmm.
-(groans)

01:14:03.090 --> 01:14:04.992 position:30% line:89% align:start
Cut the stream.

01:14:05.025 --> 01:14:06.293 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

01:14:06.327 --> 01:14:08.495 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

01:14:08.529 --> 01:14:11.465 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid your little stunt
has failed.

01:14:11.498 --> 01:14:14.368 position:10% line:83% align:start
As such, you are to clear out
your desk immediately.

01:14:15.970 --> 01:14:18.372 position:10% line:89% align:start
There's no profit in dreams.

01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:21.375 position:21% line:89% align:start
(shuddering breaths)

01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:30.184 position:13% line:89% align:start
But why all the long faces?

01:14:30.217 --> 01:14:32.453 position:35% line:83% align:start
You put on
quite an entertaining show.

01:14:32.486 --> 01:14:34.455 position:21% line:89% align:start
You should be proud.

01:14:34.488 --> 01:14:36.290 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh! Mr. President!

01:14:36.323 --> 01:14:39.226 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hurry! Turn off the stream!

01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:42.096 position:10% line:83% align:start
A certain someone informed me
of this, and I'm glad they did.

01:14:42.129 --> 01:14:43.831 position:30% line:89% align:start
(clears throat)

01:14:43.864 --> 01:14:45.165 position:30% line:89% align:start
I was watching.

01:14:45.199 --> 01:14:47.301 position:21% line:83% align:start
You know, it's by far
the best presentation

01:14:47.334 --> 01:14:49.036 position:16% line:89% align:start
I've seen in a long time.

01:14:49.069 --> 01:14:50.871 position:24% line:83% align:start
And it took resolve
and great courage

01:14:50.904 --> 01:14:53.474 position:16% line:89% align:start
in order to pull it off.

01:14:53.507 --> 01:14:56.844 position:24% line:83% align:start
This little project
has a lot of potential.

01:14:56.877 --> 01:14:59.213 position:19% line:83% align:start
We'll invest ten times
the crowdfunding amount.

01:14:59.246 --> 01:15:00.848 position:27% line:89% align:start
How's that sound?

01:15:00.881 --> 01:15:02.483 position:38% line:83% align:start
-(gasps)
-But, sir!

01:15:02.516 --> 01:15:06.186 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're using past indices as
indicators of potential growth.

01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:08.822 position:24% line:83% align:start
But you're ignoring
a very important element.

01:15:08.856 --> 01:15:10.524 position:27% line:89% align:start
What do you mean?

01:15:13.627 --> 01:15:15.362 position:35% line:5% align:start
PRESIDENT:
Take a look at this.

01:15:15.396 --> 01:15:17.598 position:5% line:5% align:start
Notice the spike in the funding.

01:15:17.631 --> 01:15:19.833 position:16% line:83% align:start
Any of you want to guess
what happened at that moment

01:15:19.867 --> 01:15:22.403 position:19% line:89% align:start
to motivate that spike?

01:15:22.436 --> 01:15:25.172 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's the moment when
Gene Fini and Alan Gardner

01:15:25.205 --> 01:15:26.940 position:33% line:83% align:start
were pouring
their hearts out to us.

01:15:29.410 --> 01:15:32.146 position:16% line:83% align:start
Assessing potential means
looking towards the future.

01:15:34.381 --> 01:15:36.150 position:10% line:89% align:start
By investing in their dreams,

01:15:36.183 --> 01:15:38.419 position:27% line:83% align:start
they're investing
in their future.

01:15:39.186 --> 01:15:41.221 position:35% line:89% align:start
Even so...

01:15:41.255 --> 01:15:43.190 position:13% line:89% align:start
And Nyallywood Bank invests

01:15:43.223 --> 01:15:45.225 position:24% line:83% align:start
in people who will
invest in their dreams.

01:15:45.259 --> 01:15:46.994 position:24% line:89% align:start
That is our motto.

01:15:47.027 --> 01:15:49.330 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hold on,
since when is that our motto?

01:15:49.363 --> 01:15:50.864 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Since now.
-Huh?

01:15:52.066 --> 01:15:56.236 position:10% line:83% align:start
And, Alan, you've got a very
bright future ahead of you.

was still a junior executive.
