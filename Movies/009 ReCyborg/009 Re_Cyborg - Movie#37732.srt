1
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:44,041
[JOE] In the beginning
was the Voice,

2
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,875
and the Voice was Him.

3
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:49,416
And man would listen to
His Voice in great awe.

4
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:56,083
But through vanity,
pride, deceit, and greed,

5
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,583
man hoarded the
riches of the earth,

6
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:04,708
raising a great many towers
whose tops reached unto heaven.

7
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:09,041
As man's arrogance scattered
its people among ravaged lands,

8
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,916
so was His Voice ignored.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,625
Yet, He gave man
a chance to atone.

10
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,041
[yelling and screaming]

11
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:20,875
[JOE] And flame and smoke
and a great roar of lions

12
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:22,708
fell upon the earth.

13
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,750
[scattered yells]

14
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:28,583
[JOE] Though pay heed,
listeners to His Voice.

15
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:31,416
For some ordeals
waged in His honor

16
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,958
may not force man
to hear as thou.

17
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:37,500
[ANCHORWOMAN] On February 26,
at about 3:30 PM...

18
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:39,333
[JOE] May the
devout bring justice

19
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:44,708
to all people of the earth,
and let mankind start anew.

20
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:47,375
May His Voice free us from sin

21
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:51,583
and bless us with glory, honor,
and prosperity unending.

22
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:52,875
[ANCHORWOMAN] At least
six buildings in total

23
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:54,791
have now collapsed
throughout the area,

24
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:58,166
with surrounding buildings
sustaining major damage.

25
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,583
Fires and debris leave the
area in a state of confusion,

26
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:05,041
severely impeding rescue
efforts. At this time,

27
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:09,500
we can only confirm that the
situation is far from contained.

28
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,333
While it is too
early to determine

29
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:14,125
an exact body count,
current estimates put

30
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:17,500
the number of casualties
at least ten thousand.

31
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,416
Chinese authorities have
declared the disaster

32
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,625
a terrorist act, and martial
law is currently in effect

33
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,583
throughout Shanghai,
as no civilians are permitted

34
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,791
to enter or exit the region.

35
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,125
Today's tragedy appears
related to the series

36
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:34,250
of suicide bombings that began
in America on January 16th

37
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:37,125
with synchronized attacks
on Chicago's Willis Tower

38
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,333
and Seattle's Columbia Center.

39
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,875
The identity of those behind
the series of attacks...

40
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:46,750
[JOE] Well planned. Must've been
in the works for some time.

41
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,875
[ANCHORWOMAN]
...as none have come forward

42
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,333
to claim responsibility...

43
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:50,666
They've beaten me to it.

44
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,208
[ANCHORWOMAN] As for the
collateral damage incurred

45
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:55,166
from the Financial Center's
collapse, experts say that...

46
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,125
[JOE] Hey, Mom?
I'll be out late tonight.

47
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,750
What? No, It's not a date
or anything like that...

48
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,541
[WAITRESS]
Hello there.

49
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,208
[GREAT BRITAIN]
Hello, Jet.

50
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,416
So now it's Shanghai, then.

51
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,708
Yeah, I've heard.
Been a while.

52
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:11,833
Well, 9/11 was, what?
'Bout twelve years ago?

53
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:12,916
How you holding up?

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,291
Haven't slacked
with my constant,

55
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:18,166
pain-in-the-ass maintenance,
so not so bad.

56
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,750
[GREAT BRITAIN] Well, you're
sounding a little testy.

57
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,208
Anything you want
to talk about?

58
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,083
Just take your pick.

59
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,958
The news spreads nothing
but paranoia lately.

60
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:32,208
The President's baffled.
And now we've gotta

61
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:36,291
come running just
'cause Gilmore says so?

62
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,708
I suppose.

63
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:44,000
How can we blow off the guy
who made us what we are?

64
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:48,041
Whenever there's trouble we
obey him, for the greater good.

65
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:52,000
Zero-Zero Cyborgs don't
get to call their own shots.

66
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:07,041
[JET] G.B., do you think
America was involved in this?

67
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,958
[GREAT BRITAIN] Actually,
I've got Israeli lobbyists

68
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,166
saying my boys in
Parliment set it all up,

69
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,458
as a great big gift to
our defense contractors.

70
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,458
Well, that's today's gossip.

71
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,000
So, what makes you ask?

72
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,583
You're not having a
"crisis of confidence"

73
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,041
in your lot's brand
of justice, are you?

74
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:37,250
Hm. Forget it.

75
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,583
If these bombings keep up,
everyone will get their turn

76
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:43,416
at the blame game. Then
things'll really go to hell.

77
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:48,041
And when they do, we'll all
have forgetten the times

78
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:51,500
when nations could
keep each other in check.

79
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,416
It's really coming down.

80
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,666
Sorry we're late.

81
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,833
It's been a slow night.
Nothing to report.

82
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,875
[TOMOE]
Joe, over here!

83
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:10,541
[TOMOE pants]

84
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,916
What do you know?
I thought I was the one

85
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,875
always dragging you out.

86
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:19,041
I would stand out
too much coming alone.

87
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:34,625
Huh?

88
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,458
I love coffee.

89
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,958
[TOMOE] You must be able to see
Tokyo Tower from your place!

90
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,333
[JOE]
Not since Tower D went up.

91
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,875
Huh?

92
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,791
Hey, how come you
ditched school today?

93
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:01,166
We're on break.
What's the point of going?

94
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,000
[TOMOE] Joe, I don't
think I've seen you talk

95
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,875
with anyone else at school.

96
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:16,416
Maybe we could try to hang
out with some of my friends?

97
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:21,333
You act like you don't
want to be noticed, ever.

98
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:24,708
Ah--! Why do you say that?

99
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,625
Just been noticing.

100
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:32,166
Ah... I never knew...

101
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,625
You've been keeping
an eye on me, huh?

102
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,291
Found you, 009.

103
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,750
This probably sounds
like nonsense to you,

104
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,541
but I feel like I've been
stuck in high school forever,

105
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,375
and it just won't end.

106
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:24,625
And it also feels like I've been
under observation all the while.

107
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:28,791
Yeah, I know I felt that way
during my entrance exams.

108
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,500
[JOE sighs]

109
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,875
This is different...

110
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,958
Really different...

111
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,458
[JOE sighs]

112
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:41,500
Also, how long have we been
going out now, anyway?

113
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:45,583
I'm not even sure how long it is
you've been putting up with me.

114
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,916
And if I honestly don't know
something that important,

115
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,250
then I guess I must have
already lost my mind

116
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,375
a really long time ago.

117
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,291
It's fine. Don't worry, Joe.

118
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:01,041
C'mere. You're just tired.

119
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,458
[JOE] I still have to
answer to His Voice.

120
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,916
And deliver justice.

121
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,833
[GREAT BRITAIN]
Jet, I need to ask you this

122
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,916
strictly off the record.

123
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:25,166
Have you heard of something
called "His Voice"?

124
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:29,791
Whose voice do you mean?

125
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,083
Not one government agency
has been able to find

126
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:35,750
even a single connection between
any of the suicide bombers

127
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,708
in their investigations.

128
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,916
But there's been this one
phrase I've kept running into

129
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,041
ever since I began looking into
this mess here in the U.S.

130
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,875
[JET] And that
would be "His Voice"?

131
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,958
Right. Before the
two U.K. bombings,

132
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,250
and the ones in
France and Hong Kong,

133
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,833
each of these people
made some kind of noise

134
00:10:56,916 --> 00:11:01,083
about obeying "His Voice"
before blowing themselves up.

135
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:04,750
They all said they wanted to
help mankind "start anew."

136
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,041
Help us "start anew"?

137
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,250
So... Whose voice is it?

138
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:26,416
Not a clue. A leader of some
kind of fundamentalist sect?

139
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,833
A syndicate boss backed
by Neocons? Hell, maybe it's

140
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:35,166
some charmismatic sociopath
building up a crazy new cult.

141
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,958
But considering we've
got no other connection

142
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:41,250
between any of the previous
thirty-three bombers,

143
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:45,291
this could be just the break
we've been looking for.

144
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,958
I'll be handing this
to the appropriate

145
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,083
intelligence agencies.

146
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,958
Just thought you should know.

147
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:58,083
Probably safest to keep
it to yourself for now.

148
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:04,250
Cheers, Jet. Less work
talk next time, hm?

149
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,708
G.B., you're really
meeting up in Istanbul?

150
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,833
[GREAT BRITAIN] Well,
I can't exactly come and go

151
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,500
as I please, now, can I?

152
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:17,500
I'll make proper arrangements
with SIS before I pop off.

153
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,375
I'm sure.

154
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,041
So, how's he been?

155
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:27,375
Remember, Jet: Butting in only
makes it worse with you two.

156
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:41,291
Now what? He's out in public.

It's nice to see you, 009.

Yeah, 001. You too.

It's been twenty-seven years.

And of course you
haven't changed one bit,

00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:19,875
now, have you, Joe?

329
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:22,541
Leading a normal life during
peace time could prove

330
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:26,958
complicated with a body
like yours that doesn't age.

331
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:29,666
That's why I've reset
your mind every three years

332
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,625
and locked away
your memories of us.

333
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:35,083
I felt this would afford
you the stability needed

to act as leader of

What's important is,
you're here now.

339
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:51,875
Yeah. Although I have to say,
repeating high school

340
00:33:51,958 --> 00:33:55,666

more than a bit stifling.

You remembered it all?

342
00:33:57,791 --> 00:34:02,291
The memories from each reset
seemed to linger, somehow.

in the United States.

360
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:55,250

ever be granted permission

to any bad blood
between you two.

363

Now, let me explain what
the NSA's involved with.

364
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,875
After the skyscraper bombings
originated in the United States,

365
00:35:14,958 --> 00:35:18,000
a great deal of conspiracy
theories had arisen.

366
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,791
Obviously, several
of them suggest

367
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:23,000
the U.S. government's
possible involvement.

368
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:26,791
[IVAN] Have you heard
of Samuel Capital?

369
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:30,166
It's a private investment
fund based in America.

370
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,583
Though it acts on
behalf of its investors

371
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:36,875
in Israel's Ministry of Defense.
Samuel Capital has one goal:

372
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:39,500
to profit from the
military-industrial complex

373
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:43,000
by undermining world
peace and stability.

374
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:46,875
[Dr. GILMORE] The American
government seemed to have

375
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:49,750
supported this agenda,
believing it would ultimately

376
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:52,916
let the U.S. regain
global preeminence.

377
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:57,250
My theory is supported
by Congress ignoring

378
00:35:57,333 --> 00:36:01,291
the illegal activities of
Samuel Capital's affiliates...

379
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:05,166
chief among them being
the Post-Humanity Project.

380
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,375
[IVAN] This includes the
development of cyborgs

381
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:09,500
called Lazarus that are
made from the corpses

382
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:14,208
of U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq,
as well as civilian casualties.

383
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:16,458
Cyborgs from corpses?!

384
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:19,208
[DR. GILMORE] Yes.

tell us more on
this matter, but...

386
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:24,708
I suspect the initial
suicide bombings in America

387
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:28,708
were carried out by these
Lazarus-type cyborgs.

388
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:31,625
And by manufacturing
their own suicide bombers,

Samuel Capital is poised
to control a new war,

and Samuel Capital's
subversive plan

394

is the true cause of the
international bombings,

395

facilitating this new means

If Samuel Capital really is

of Axis of Evil,

417

It's a strong possibility.
But before we take any action,

00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,375
we first must understand
precisely how Samuel Capital

was able to execute all 34

at every turn.

626
00:56:29,208 --> 00:56:31,875
So I deserve some answers.

627
00:56:31,958 --> 00:56:34,625
Several U.S. military personnel
were directly involved

628
00:56:34,708 --> 00:56:37,500
in the last bombing.
And each one of them

629
00:56:37,583 --> 00:56:41,750
claimed to have heard
something called "His Voice."

630
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:46,375
And if responsibility lies
right here at Samuel Capital,

631
00:56:46,458 --> 00:56:49,416
then you should be greatly
concerned, Mr. Klein.

632
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:52,833
Now tell me what His Voice is!

633
00:56:54,041 --> 00:56:55,833
[KLEIN groans]

634
00:56:55,916 --> 00:56:57,958
[JET] The United States is
going to face accusations

635
00:56:58,041 --> 00:57:01,375
from the whole world because
of this latest bombing!

636
00:57:01,458 --> 00:57:04,875
We need to know what we're
dealing with here, and how

637
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:08,250
our own troops are getting
dragged into all of this!

638
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,250
[KLEIN]
Hm.

639
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:14,291
This state of affairs has
only ever proven itself

640
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:18,875
to be beneficial for us all.
Mankind is set on its path

641
00:57:18,958 --> 00:57:23,166
to begin anew, whether we
choose to intervene or not.

642
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,833
What the hell
are you saying?

643
00:57:26,916 --> 00:57:30,833
You take issue with this?
All we've ever done

644
00:57:30,916 --> 00:57:33,750
is aided mankind by
answering His Voice.

645
00:57:33,833 --> 00:57:35,333
[JET shudders]

646
00:58:42,958 --> 00:58:44,583
[JOE sighs]

647
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:08,333
I have been unable to
make contact with G.B.

648
00:59:10,916 --> 00:59:14,291
So, what? He's gotten
swept away by this "voice,"

649
00:59:14,375 --> 00:59:16,333
just like Pyunma?

650
00:59:16,416 --> 00:59:19,333
But what would the disappearance
of him have to do with G.B.'s?

651
00:59:19,416 --> 00:59:20,666
Hmm...

652
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:23,416
Pyunma had discovered
that "angel fossil"

653
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:27,833
while researching Olduvai
Gorge down in Tanzania.

654
00:59:27,916 --> 00:59:30,875
His notes say that,
as the skeleton was unearthed,

655
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:32,625
more and more
of his dig staff

656
00:59:32,708 --> 00:59:34,833
claimed they'd started
hearing something.

657
00:59:34,916 --> 00:59:38,791
Something they'd only
refer to as "His Voice."

658
00:59:42,625 --> 00:59:46,333
[HEINRICH] They each
said the same thing...

659
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:49,541
"In the beginning
was the Voice.

660
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:51,708
And the Voice was Him.

661
00:59:51,791 --> 00:59:55,000
And man would
listen to His Voice.

662
00:59:55,083 --> 01:00:00,375
But through vanity,
pride, deceit, and greed,

663
01:00:00,458 --> 01:00:03,375
man hoarded the
riches of the earth,

664
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:09,000
raising a great many towers
whose tops reached unto heaven.

665
01:00:09,083 --> 01:00:13,791
As man's arrogance scattered
its people among ravaged lands,

666
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:16,666
so was His Voice ignored.

667
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:21,416
Yet, He gave man
a chance to atone.

668
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:25,500
And flame and smoke
and a great roar of lions

669
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:27,416
fell upon the earth.

670
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:31,458
And man's towers
were brought to dust."

671
01:00:34,125 --> 01:00:36,833
If it's biblical,
I've not heard it.

672
01:00:36,916 --> 01:00:38,750
[IVAN] That is because
there is no such passage

673
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:41,500
in any version of the Bible.

674
01:00:41,583 --> 01:00:43,125
Pyunma knew that.

675
01:00:43,208 --> 01:00:47,250
So he figured his staff
came across this "voice" thing

676
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:52,125
while they were all leafing
through some old apocrypha.

677
01:00:52,208 --> 01:00:56,250
But, as soon as the bombings
started on January 16th,

678
01:00:56,333 --> 01:01:01,000
Pyunma remembered.
Remembered every word they said.

679
01:01:01,083 --> 01:01:03,500
It was like those
words described

680
01:01:03,583 --> 01:01:05,333
all of the
skyscraper bombings

681
01:01:05,416 --> 01:01:08,416
that suddenly began
happening everywhere.

682
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:13,833
And he knew that by
studying our origins,

683
01:01:13,916 --> 01:01:16,125
he was studying how we think.

684
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:20,250
So, with that in mind, Pyunmna
hypothesized that his staffers

685
01:01:20,333 --> 01:01:23,166
had a kind of "religious
experience" when they saw

686
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:26,166
that "angel" fossil,
an experience called

687
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:29,708
"His Voice." And Pyunma
wondered if, in a way,

688
01:01:29,791 --> 01:01:32,750
they really had heard
a message from "God."

689
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:35,916
So then, what do
we make of that?

690
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,125
[HEINRICH] Hmm... Well,
this religious historian,

691
01:01:39,208 --> 01:01:43,166
Mircea Eliade, wrote about
some "mystical solidarity"

692
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:46,666
between man and nature:
Hunting and farming had

693
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:51,041
taught our ancestors about
the cycles of life. And death.

694
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:54,125
Eliade thought that
understanding our connection

695
01:01:54,208 --> 01:01:57,625
with these cycles, is what
ultimately allowed our minds

696
01:01:57,708 --> 01:02:00,541
and our cultures to evolve.

697
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:04,625
But the awareness of death
also led to the fear of death.

698
01:02:04,708 --> 01:02:07,666
In trying rationalize
such a huge mystery,

699
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:11,916
people, you could say,
"invented" God.

700
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,708
Freud also thought
religion came from the need

701
01:02:15,791 --> 01:02:19,875
"to shield ourselves from these
intimidating forces of nature"--

702
01:02:19,958 --> 01:02:22,875
things in life that
are too overwhelming.

703
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:30,166
So, basically, just like our
ancestors "created" God

704
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:34,541
out of their fear of death, we
had then "created" "His Voice",

705
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:37,791
after seeing some damned
fossil that we did not know

706
01:02:37,875 --> 01:02:41,333
how to explain.
According to Pyunma.

707
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:45,208
Let's say that the
suicide bombers believed

708
01:02:45,291 --> 01:02:46,625
His Voice was divine.

709
01:02:46,708 --> 01:02:49,250
So then, why is it that every
person who has heard it

710
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:51,541
has gone on to
be a suicide bomber?

711
01:02:51,625 --> 01:02:53,833
It just doesn't make sense.

712
01:02:53,916 --> 01:02:57,166
Well. Stick with me,
because Pyunma's reasoning

713
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:59,250
gets even stranger.

714
01:02:59,333 --> 01:03:03,166
He says, "in all of history,
no one's murdered more people

715
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:05,333
for laughs than God."

716
01:03:05,416 --> 01:03:08,500
[DR. GILMORE] I understand.
But even if His Voice

717
01:03:08,583 --> 01:03:11,166
were actually some
kind of divine power,

718
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:13,000
we mustn't overlook
the possibility

719
01:03:13,083 --> 01:03:16,875
that it's now being exploited
for political gains.

720
01:03:16,958 --> 01:03:19,708
That's true, governments
will exploit religion,

721
01:03:19,791 --> 01:03:22,416
like anything else.
A certain dictator

722
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:26,333
from my home country
definitely comes to mind.

723
01:03:26,416 --> 01:03:29,583
Actually, one of the more
bizarre rumors surrounding

724
01:03:29,666 --> 01:03:33,500
"the Fuhrer" is that he was
compelled to wage the Holocaust

725
01:03:33,583 --> 01:03:37,166
in the first place after
he had come into posession

726
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:39,458
of the fossil of an angel.

727
01:03:39,541 --> 01:03:41,000
Hmph.

728
01:03:42,375 --> 01:03:44,583
[HEINRICH] Pyunma had
asked G.B. to research

729
01:03:44,666 --> 01:03:48,750
that particular fossil.
The fact that G.B. has now

730
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:52,916
also gone missing sounds
like more than a coincidence.

731
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,041
[BOTH]
Hmm...

732
01:03:55,125 --> 01:03:58,458
Heinrich, if what you're
calling "God" is the product

733
01:03:58,541 --> 01:04:01,958
of a mind seeking
answers, then tell me:

734
01:04:02,041 --> 01:04:05,041
How can it intervene
so directly as to incite

735
01:04:05,125 --> 01:04:07,541
suicide bombings,
and to actually make

736
01:04:07,625 --> 01:04:10,791
some people
disappear altogether?

737
01:04:10,875 --> 01:04:12,791
[HEINRICH]
Good question.

738
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:16,333
As he studied mankind's
origins, Pyunma eventually

739
01:04:16,416 --> 01:04:19,291
began to suspect that,
either through evolution

740
01:04:19,375 --> 01:04:22,333
or maybe the influence
of something else entirely,

741
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:25,875
our minds had
actually become a God.

742
01:04:28,125 --> 01:04:31,416
[HEINRICH] He wrote, "Could our
human minds--these things that

743

744
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:38,333
themselves be a 'God'?
What if our collective

mind holds some unknown factor
that we've simply called "God"

for lack of a better term?
What if this is the factor

they could hear

The nukes haven't launched yet?

940
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:40,791
[IVAN] No, not yet, Doctor. The
deployment of nuclear missiles

941
01:23:40,875 --> 01:23:43,916
requires multiple
authorizations. It's possible

942
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,333
there's some unrest within
the submarine's crew.

943
01:23:52,958 --> 01:23:54,708
[HEINRICH] I'd really
like to trust you guys.

944
01:23:54,791 --> 01:23:56,708
Unfortunately, I cannot.

945
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:18,708

Francoise...

953
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,458
You can calculate the
missile's trajectory, right?

954
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,458
[JOE] It looks like we'll have
to detonate it. Manually.

955
01:26:04,541 --> 01:26:08,250
And you're going to do it
yourself? Joe, you can't!

956
01:26:08,333 --> 01:26:11,750
Even if you succeed, you won't
make it down from that altitude!

957
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:13,500
I know that.

Then, why?!

01:26:15,375 --> 01:26:19,375

time for you to make it back!

979
01:29:37,166 --> 01:29:40,958
[JET] Joe, even if you stop
the nuke, there's no guarantee

980
01:29:41,041 --> 01:29:43,375
you'll stop His Voice.
Are you sure you want

981
01:29:43,458 --> 01:29:44,958
to go through with this?

982
01:29:45,041 --> 01:29:47,708
[JOE] Everyone answers
His Voice differently,

983
01:29:47,791 --> 01:29:50,958
based on their frame of mind.
If we show people

984
01:29:51,041 --> 01:29:53,375
they can stand up to
this kind of answer,

985
01:29:53,458 --> 01:29:56,041
they might join us
in fighting for peace!

986
01:29:57,833 --> 01:30:01,375
[JET] And you believe that's
what His Voice really wanted?

987
01:30:01,458 --> 01:30:05,375
[JOE] Maybe. Enough to know that
this is the right decision!

[JOE] It's true, people
can be foolish...

In groups, we easily
get corrupted

One that we can't
seem to resist.

1000
01:31:18,166 --> 01:31:21,333
We aren't perfect,
but that means we also

1001
01:31:21,416 --> 01:31:23,833
have so much potential.

We've done terrible things
together, but we can do

great together as well.
That's what makes us worth it!

to crush the hopes

everything, risked their lives,

all that's good about us

and destroy us anyway?!

it's a mystery.

But the very fact
that you're here

means He answered
you this time.

myself here when I came to.

[JET] And where
exactly is "here?"

1033
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,958
Well, if you guys made it,
maybe it's Heaven?

1034
01:36:55,375 --> 01:36:57,916
[DR. GILMORE] No. This is
the exact same world

1035
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,250
you boys helped save.

1036

It's good to have
you back with us.

You should know that I
am very proud of you all.

How'd we get here?

1039
01:37:09,791 --> 01:37:12,041
"His Voice" did this?

1040
01:37:12,125 --> 01:37:14,708
Who knows? Maybe we're all here

1041
01:37:14,791 --> 01:37:18,875
because someone who had heard
His Voice asked loud enough.

1042
01:37:20,291 --> 01:37:24,125
Even if that's true, what the
hell are we supposed to do next?

1043
01:37:24,208 --> 01:37:28,291
This isn't over.
The fighting will only continue.

1044

been gravely affected

by the atrocities commited
in answer to "His Voice."

1046

So then, doesn't that make
it all the more necessary

1047
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:39,666
that you continue to
fight for the justice

[FRANCOISE] You know, as I
watched those shooting stars,

1051
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:02,291
I thought, maybe...

1052
01:38:02,375 --> 01:38:04,208
His Voice doesn't
bestow burdens

1053
01:38:04,291 --> 01:38:06,750
that humanity
can't overcome.

[JOE gasps]

1055

And that maybe those
"angels" are monuments

1056
01:38:24,458 --> 01:38:27,708
to every one of the people
who've heard His Voice

1057
01:38:27,791 --> 01:38:32,291
and sacrificed themselves
to do what was right.
