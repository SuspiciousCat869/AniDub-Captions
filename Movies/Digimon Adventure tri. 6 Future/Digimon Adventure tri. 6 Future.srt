1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:02,802
(Digital jingle)

2
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:37,670
(thunder claps)

3
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,725
(digital jingle)

4
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:21,347
- [Hackmon] The one born from the vast darkness

5
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,483
is a burning flame.

6
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:26,386
A rising moon which wipes away the memory

7
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:30,723
of daylight, the searing embrace of a dark power,

8
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,227
dancing madly in a crazed storm.

9
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:39,399
However, in time, even this storm shall pass.

10
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,205
In its wake, joy and prosperity will vanquish despair,

11
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:50,143
and the darkness will fade into the light.

12
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,547
(somber orchestral music)

13
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,757
- [Joe] If King Drasil gets his way,

14
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,460
I think we all know what's going to happen.

15
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,262
The human world is going to be swallowed

16
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,563
by the digital world.

17
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,735
(growling)

18
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:20,707
(forlorn orchestral music)

19
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,763
(loud rumbling)

20
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,632
- Hold on tight.

21
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,835
(dramatic piano music)

22
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,643
(loud crash)

23
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,948
- Tai?

24
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:05,218
(woeful piano music)

25
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,769
Where are you, big brother?

26
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,311
The two of us, we've always been together.

27
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,914
Sometimes you got bored.

28
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,417
Sometimes I got angry.

29
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,685
Lots of times we had fun.

30
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,555
But you were always right there.

31
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,726
(alarm beeping)

32
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:21,561
You awake?

33
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,064
Of course not.

34
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,800
Hello, world to Tai Kamiya, wake up.

35
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,504
Let's go, rise and shine.

36
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:45,418
- [T.K.] Kari, Kari?

37
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,421
(Patamon whimpers)

38
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,622
- What is it, T.K.?

39
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,024
- You all right?

40
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,091
- Mm-hmm.

41
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,428
(Patamon whimpers)

42
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,563
- Just thinking about Tai.

43
00:04:58,865 --> 00:04:59,766
Where'd he go?

44
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,615
- (gasps) Look at that, guys.

45
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,784
It just keeps getting closer.

46
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,653
(all gasp)

47
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,523
- I can see our school.

48
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:24,724
- Can they see us?

49
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:27,026
- Distortions everywhere.

50
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,729
- [Joe] What do you make of this, Izzy?

51
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:32,398
- The line separating the human and the digital world

52
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,966
is starting to disappear.

53
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,901
(grunts)

54
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,769
- Couldn't that be a good thing though?

55
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:39,605
We wouldn't need a portal to go to your world anymore.

56
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,541
- I can go see Joe anytime.

57
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:42,942
- It's not that simple.

58
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,844
If this keeps up, there won't be

59
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:47,013
a human world for any of us to visit.

60
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,048
- I guess Homeostasis isn't going to stop

61
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,517
King Drasil from reshaping both worlds.

62
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,588
- [Matt] (grunts) There's no way I'm going

63
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:56,823
to let that happen.

64
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,024
- But what can we do?

65
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,993
We can't even control Meicoomon anymore,

66
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,161
now that she's combined with Ophanimon

67
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,464
and her Dark Mode.

68
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,033
She's grown more powerful than ever.

69
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,538
Homeostasis wants only stability and harmony.

70
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,073
That's it's only purpose.

71
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,908
- That's what they always say.

72
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,511
- So how are we gonna save Meicoomon.

73
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,613
(explosion)

74
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:21,881
(all gasp)

75
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,950
- Is that pink lava a portal, Izzy?

76
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:26,452
- Not only that, it connects directly

77
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:27,920
to the human world.

78
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,822
And it's within walking distance.

79
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,192
What do you say, Matt?

80
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,696
Should we go home?

81
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,066
(dramatic piano music)

82
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:40,967
- Yes.

83
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,737
- [Tentomon] Walking distance is far.

84
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:45,838
- [Biyomon] Yeah, only because we don't

85
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:46,739
have legs.

86
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,975
- [Tentomon] But dancing looks like fun.

87
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,943
- Not as fun as flying.

88
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,879
When Tai through me in the air,

89
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,714
ah, that was so much fun.

90
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,782
- [Palmon] I remember that.

91
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:56,616
I wanna fly.

92
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:57,583
Throw me, Mimi.

93
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,185
- [Koromon] When Tai comes back,

94
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:00,620
he'll make us all fly.

95
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,193
- [Tentomon] Maybe we should talk about another topic.

96
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,494
How about food, food's good.

97
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,696
- [Koromon] Ah food would be good.

98
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,199
That would make this walking distance much shorter.

99
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,600
What have you got?

100
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:15,902
- [Tentmon] I've got nothing.

101
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,737
- [Koromon] Well why do you wanna talk about it?

102
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,071
That's not nice.

103
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,540
- It's okay, you know?

104
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:21,340
- Hmm?

105
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,910
- I know you don't want to leave.

106
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,979
Let the rest of us handle things

107
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,182
back in the human world for awhile.

108
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,551
You wanna stay and look for Tai, don't ya?

109
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,786
- Well, yeah.

110
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,122
I'd like to stay here, but I can't.

111
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,090
Our world needs to be saved too.

112
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:45,765
- Hmm, it still doesn't seem real, does it?

113
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,099
What happened to everyone.

114
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,635
First Meicoomon.

115
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,003
Then Gatomon.

116
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:54,640
And poor Mr. Nishijima was just trying to help Tai.

117
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:58,678
It's like a bad dream.

118
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,717
- I keep thinking Tai's gonna come around

119
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,185
the corner any minute.

120
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,753
And really tick me off.

121
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,823
- Yeah, I wish.

122
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:15,561
Just between us, can I ask you something?

123
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:16,262
- Sure.

124
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:22,235
As long as it's got nothing to do with ghosts.

125
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,836
But maybe we should get going before everybody

126
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,704
starts won--

127
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,672
- What happens if Tai's really gone?

128
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,074
(Matt groans)

129
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:31,043
I mean, it kinda looks like he's gone.

130
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:35,648
I know that doesn't sound remotely possible,

131
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,617
but the last time we saw him, he fell into

132
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,551
a big crack.

133
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:41,187
And when it closed back up, he was gone.

134
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:43,956
And I'm worried about Kari.

135
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,259
She lost her brother and her Digi partner

136
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:49,128
got turned into a giant flying feathered monster.

137
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,198
(sighs) All right, I'm done.

138
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,666
And now you tell me there's no point

139
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,934
in getting all emotional and we just

140
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,669
have to buckle up and keep going.

141
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,870
- Exactly.

142
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,605
- That's good advice.

143
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,873
- [Biyomon] Sora!

144
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,676
- Over here, Biyomon.

145
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,078
- (gasps) What did you do?

146
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,747
- Hey, hey, everything's okay.

147
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,614
- You've been crying.

148
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,650
Was he singing one of his songs to you?

149
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,285
They're awful and they don't even rhyme.

150
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,152
- How would you know?

151
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:14,787
- You sing in your sleep.

152
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:22,662
- [Whines] Oh Tai, I'm leaving now.

153
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,364
Come find me again, in your world.

154
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,067
- [Professor] Thank you all for coming.

155
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,902
As you know, recent Digimon attacks

156
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,837
have resulted in power outages and caused

157
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,773
digital devices to fail.

158
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,075
Reports of hostile Digimon wreaking havoc

159
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,644
on critical infrastructure continues to pour in

160
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,313
from every corner of the world

161
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,114
with no end in sight.

162
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,016
These incidents are proof that our world

163
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,686
is being systematically invaded by the digital world

164
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,354
and we must act at once.

165
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,656
We had hoped the military forces would not

166
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,426
have to enter the cities, but it's clear that

167
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,094
we are now past that point.

168
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:07,073
Meiko, call me as soon as you get back.

169
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,310
Where is my daughter?

170
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,179
- [Hackman] Your efforts are in vain.

171
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,681
The situation is beyond the power of humans

172
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:16,849
to control.

173
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,017
- [Professor] What do you mean by that?

174
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:18,951
What's going on?

175
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,354
- The attempt by Homeostasis to eliminate

176
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,389
the Libra has failed.

177
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,859
(Professor gasps)

178
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,428
(loud rumbling)

179
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,002
During the battle, the Libra combined

180
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:39,905
with Ophanimon Falldown Mode, this was not expected.

181
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,076
The result was the creation of the Digimon

182
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,945
known as Ordinemon.

183
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:49,215
The worlds harmony is now utterly lost.

184
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:52,852
- And Meiko, did the children get out safely?

185
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,353
- No one was sacrificed.

186
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,422
Homeostasis does not wish that.

187
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,426
We must act before events spin further

188
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,494
out of control.

189
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,930
The time has come to execute the fallback option,

190
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,866
our plan of last resort.

191
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,200
- What does that mean?

192
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,436
- If we do not stop Ordinemon,

193
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,071
the human world as you know it

194
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:15,107
is finished and nothing will remain of mankind.

195
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,476
It's possible that the fallback option itself

196
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,245
will destroy your world.

197
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,247
But if we do nothing, then we remove

198
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,849
any doubt about what will happen.

199
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,752
Let us hope it's not already too late.

200
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,789
(sinister ambience)

201
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,893
(professor groans)

202
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,237
- Well, we're here.

203
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,472
- What's been going on?

204
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:47,440
- [Man Over Intercom] All citizens

205
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,075
are ordered to clear the streets and public

206
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,409
areas until further notice.

207
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,511
A state of emergency has been declared.

208
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,147
Repeat, all citizens are to clear city streets

209
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,849
and public areas and to remain indoors

210
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,317
until further notice.

211
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,419
- [Izzy] At least that thing that Meicoomon

212
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,522
turned into hasn't shown up in the city yet.

213
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,424
- There's nothing about it on the news?

214
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,460
- There would be, if it was here.

215
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:08,894
- That's for sure.

216
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:09,795
- So now what?

217
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,564
We saw it disappear into a distortion.

218
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:14,467
- Yeah, we did, what do you think, Izzy?

219
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,335
- [(Zzy] Unfortunately, as much as we don't

220
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,504
want it in this world, we have to assume

221
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:19,872
it'll come here.

222
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,540
It's a very powerful Digimon.

223
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,142
- [Kari] This is all...

224
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:25,878
My fault.

225
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:26,779
- [All] Huh?

226
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,282
- Tai is gone.

227
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,152
- Kari, no, no.

228
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:35,955
Don't talk like that.

229
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,189
- What if he is?

230
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,090
Then what?

231
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:40,960
Where's my brother?

232
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,063
(sorrowful piano music)

233
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,199
Please come back, Tai, please.

234
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,301
(Kari sobs)

235
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:52,171
- Mimi, when you cry, I cry, too.

236
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,974
(Palmon crying)

237
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:55,975
- Come back, Tai.

238
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,045
- She fainted.

239
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,447
- Don't let her fall.

240
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,948
- [Sora] Her forehead's so hot.

241
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:03,816
She has a fever.

242
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:06,152
- But she was okay when we got here.

243
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,520
- It's all the stress.

244
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,487
It got to her.

245
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,893
- I guess you can say that every bad thing

246
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,427
that's happened is my fault.

247
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,933
Ever since Meicoomon went crazy,

248
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,202
it seems like nothing's gone right for us.

249
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,570
- That's not true.

250
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:26,472
Remember that time we had cake?

251
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:27,506
- Yeah, chocolate.

252
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,941
- Lots of things have gone right

253
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,643
for us since then, Meiko.

254
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:33,012
But the future is what's important now.

255
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:34,213
Not the past.

256
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,448
I think she'll be fine if we just

257
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,616
get her off her feet.

258
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,285
Come on, lie down for a bit, Kari.

259
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,953
(Kari moans)

260
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,925
(gentle piano music)

261
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,531
- [Matt] Tai or no Tai, we'll be okay.

262
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,402
- [T.K.] I hope you're right about that, Matt.

263
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,904
- Uh, Joe.

264
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,240
- What's up?

265
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,008
- Koromon's acting weird.

266
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,476
- [Joe] Maybe he swallowed a bug.

267
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,111
- Bugs don't taste that bad.

268
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,580
- [Mimi] Oh, you poor thing.

269
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:10,049
You don't sound good at all, Koromon.

270
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:10,749
What's wrong?

271
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,218
- Maybe he's just super hungry

272
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,552
after all those battles.

273
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,120
- You know what they say about feeding

274
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,289
a Digimon with an empty stomach.

275
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,358
A gold banana is quite restorative

276
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,060
and tastes better when someone else

277
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,294
makes it for you.

278
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,429
- I love that saying.

279
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:24,496
Let's order in.

280
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,231
(Digimon's cheering)

281
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,067
- We have to eat two digi bars.

282
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,536
(Gomamon laughing)

283
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,271
- [Gomamon] Pepperoni for me, Joe.

284
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:34,974
- [Joe] Good to see some things are still

285
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,041
the same as ever.

286
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,545
(Meiko chuckles)

287
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:54,960
- Of all the things that have happened

288
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,630
to us, Tai, this one might be the worst.

289
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,366
I don't remember when the odds were ever

290
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,201
this tough before.

291
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,237
Why did you have to disappear on us now, Tai?

292
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,606
How can I do this when I'm all alone?

293
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,042
(Matt groans)

294
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,176
- Why would you ever think

295
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,378
that you're alone, Matt?

296
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,648
I'm with you.

297
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,117
- Gabumon?

298
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,552
- Tentomon was right, I ate and I grew, (laughing).

299
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:25,090
(Matt laughs)

300
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,159
So listen, it seems like you're having

301
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,727
some trouble dealing with stuff now that

302
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,695
Tai's not here.

303
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,363
- You heard that?

304
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,599
- But as they say, your Digimon partner

305
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,434
has all the answers.

306
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,604
- They really say that?

307
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,306
- Nah, I just made it up.

308
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,740
But it sounds like a real answer

309
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,742
so it must be true, (laughing).

310
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,511
(Matt laughs)

311
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,346
Everything's going to be okay, Matt.

312
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,317
You're gonna be a great leader

313
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,584
and you're not alone.

314
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,253
You'll never be alone as long as

315
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,288
you have me around.

316
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,090
(Matt sighs)

317
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,125
You know you can count on me.

318
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,593
I'll stay by your side no matter

319
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,362
how bad things get.

320
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,063
- Thanks, Gabumon.

321
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,565
- Even if that Ordinemon blows up

322
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:09,368
the whole city, or if you mess up

323
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:10,569
and get us all deleted.

324
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:11,470
- Huh?

325
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,806
- Or if you get confused and we get lost

326
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,108
and go through a distortion, only,

327
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,509
it's the wrong one and we all end up

328
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,478
floating around in space forever.

329
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,113
- That's not gonna happen.

330
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,181
- (sighs) And when you get married,

331
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:23,349
I'll watch your kids.

332
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,651
And when you get old, I'll go for walks

333
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:28,487
with you, I'll do anything for you.

334
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,788
I'll even save the world.

335
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,826
- Thank you, Gabumon.

336
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,394
Thank you for everything.

337
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:39,298
(gentle piano music)

338
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,533
- [Gabuman] Tai is still in your heart, Matt.

339
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,204
- [Matt] I know that.

340
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,772
I think about him all the time.

341
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,810
I think I understand what he was trying

342
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:52,745
to tell me now.

343
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,550
I just didn't want to hear it back then.

344
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,620
What's going on in your head?

345
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,122
This isn't like you.

346
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,791
The old you would've taken action.

347
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,259
- I don't know what to do.

348
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,129
It's not like when we were kids.

349
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,133
(gentle piano music)

350
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,736
These days it feels like I see more but,

351
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,339
I understand less.

352
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,675
Is fighting the answer?

353
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,811
It might seem right at the time...

354
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,816
But maybe it's not.

355
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:34,086
(gentle piano music)

356
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,860
I still believe we're the only ones

357
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,595
who can fix this.

358
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,265
I'm just worried, what if we make it worse?

359
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:51,703
- (scoffs) Oh spare me, look.

360
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,471
- What?

361
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,540
- Quit trying to run away from it.

362
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:00,512
I finally realized how much I depended on him.

363
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,383
It's terrifying to lose something irreplaceable.

364
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:06,718
I know that now.

365
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,821
Now that Tai's gone.

366
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,424
- You have to stop thinking that way, Matt.

367
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,460
You're just making it harder on yourself.

368
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,928
You know you're the only one who can

369
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,496
step up and take over for Tai.

370
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:20,265
And you know that's what he would want.

371
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,367
So, do it for him.

372
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,838
(Matt crying)

373
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,580
it's all right, don't cry.

374
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,150
- [Matt] You're making me cry.

375
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,387
(Matt crying)

376
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,522
Hmm?

377
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:44,490
What are you doing?

378
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:45,224
- [All] Hmm?

379
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,191
- [Tentomon] Uh nothing really.

380
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,594
We were just out for a walk and you know.

381
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,429
(Digimon chattering)

382
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,630
- [Matt] A walk, huh?

383
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,532
And your walk just happened to bring you all

384
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,534
right to that window at the same time?

385
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:56,935
- [Tentomon] Well, it is a very nice window.

386
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,404
- Maybe it's time for a digi-spanking.

387
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,307
(Digimon yelping)

388
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,913
(groans) Knuckleheads.

389
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,281
- Matt? - Hmm?

390
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,719
- [Gabumon] Something's happening.

391
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:14,620
- Distortion.

392
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:20,392
- [Gabumon] That's right, you have Tai's goggles.

393
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,260
Put them on.

394
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,429
- Here it goes.

395
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,666
(sighs)

396
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:35,274
(crackling)

397
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,244
(rumbling)

398
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,446
(Matt whimpers)

399
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,249
(menacing music)

400
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,295
No way.

401
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,465
(loud whooshing)

402
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,671
(swooshing)

403
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:09,508
(sinister music)

404
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,912
(screeching)

405
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,420
Meicoomon's just reappeared!

406
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,458
- Everyone evacuate the area at once.

407
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:26,892
Everybody out!

408
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,126
Everybody out!

409
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,430
- [Officer] The police cannot patrol down here, stay here.

410
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,399
- [Japanator] Chopper later to group.

411
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,501
Follow me and fly low. - Roger that.

412
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,939
(loud crash)

413
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,709
(intense music)

414
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:53,085
(eerie screeching)

415
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:55,954
(spooky ambience)

416
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,627
(thunderous footsteps)

417
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:08,700
- (maniacal laughter) I can't believe

418
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:12,404
those fools have created this monster.

419
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,772
It's fantastic.

420
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,307
They're doing my job for me.

421
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:19,945
All I have to do now is stand back and watch.

422
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:22,681
Do it, Ordinemon, destroy it.

423
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:24,049
Destroy it all!

424
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:26,318
Burn this rotten, useless world sown.

425
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,821
Destroy these humans and everything

426
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,523
they've created.

427
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,692
(maniacal laughter) And in from its flames

428
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:36,628
and ashes, a new world shall arise.

429
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:40,499
A new world ruled by King Drasil, hee-hee-hee.

430
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,903
- Citizens are reminded to stay indoors

431
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,906
and to monitor this channel for further news bulletins.

432
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:50,342
(sizzling)

433
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,447
- Has anybody heard from Tai yet?

434
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,915
- Not yet, nothing.

435
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:59,418
- Same here, I can't contact Meiko.

436
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:00,552
(loud thud)

437
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:04,556
(citizens screaming and crying)

438
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:16,968
- Things seem bad, but we have to trust our kids

439
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,071
and know they'll find a way out of it.

440
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:22,507
- Mm hmm, that's the only thing we can do.

441
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,176
They're all survivors.

442
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:25,811
I have faith in them.

443
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:29,481
- Dance, my horrible monster.

444
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,550
Just keep on dancing (maniacal laughter).

445
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,489
Destroy everything, Ordinemon!

446
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:41,460
(eerie ambience)

447
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,162
(foreboding music)

448
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,835
(sizzling)

449
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:54,773
- [Japanator] Stay on my six, we're going in.

450
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:56,641
- [Pilot] Right behind ya, Japanator.

451
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:57,609
(female yelling and crying)

452
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:58,477
- [Officer] Keep moving!

453
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,144
Keep moving!

454
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,679
Don't panic, people.

455
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,114
- [Meiko] Is that really Meicoomon?

456
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:06,084
- [Joe] How are we supposed to stop that?

457
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:09,054
- I was going to volunteer to go talk to her,

458
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:12,524
but now that I see her, maybe not.

459
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,593
- Swallowing Ophanimon has made her

460
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,828
a little more intense.

461
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:19,765
The situation has gotten quite dangerous.

462
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,666
- Oh Mei, now what?

463
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,136
(loud whirling and thuds)

464
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,972
(sinister music)

465
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,478
- Let's go, Gabumon.

466
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,713
- Roger that.

467
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:38,049
(upbeat inspiring music)

468
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,593
- [All] Gomamon, Tentomon, Biyomon, Palmon, Gabumon

469
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:49,661
digivolve to...

470
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:52,731
(upbeat dance music)

471
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:58,637
(singing in foreign language)

472
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,747
- Garurumon!

473
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,115
- Togemon!

474
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,783
- Birdramon!

475
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,518
- Kabuterimon!

476
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,086
- Ikkakumon!

477
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,990
(singing in foreign language)

478
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,264
- [All] Digivolve to...

479
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:30,135
(singing in foreign language)

480
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:37,075
- WereGarurumon!

481
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,844
- MegaKabuterimon!

482
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,011
- Lilimon!

483
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:41,012
- Garudamon!

484
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:44,015
- Zudomon, let's go.

485
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:47,886
(singing in foreign language)

486
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,160
(laughing)

487
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:59,598
- What do you want?

488
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,099
- I see you still prefer to wear

489
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,134
that disguise, edging your bets

490
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,237
just in case your little plan falls through.

491
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,106
- Yeah, this war is as good as over.

492
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,575
What are you doing here anyway?

493
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:11,977
Come to eat some popcorn and watch

494
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,346
the whole human world's last pathetic performance?

495
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,681
- [Hackmon] It's too early to predict what will happen.

496
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,283
- [King Drasil] You guys won't like the ending.

497
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:21,152
- [Hackmon] Homeostasis wishes for harmony and stability

498
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,220
in the world.

499
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,122
(King Drasil laughs)

500
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:25,924
- [King Drasil] Now this is getting bold.

501
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,359
I think you need a new catchphrase.

502
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:29,828
I mean, come on, you're destroying everything anyway,

503
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,129
just like we would.

504
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:33,732
- Harmony and stability are the opposites

505
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:34,699
of what you seek.

506
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:38,169
You seek only destruction and pain and fear.

507
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,605
(King Drasil laughs maniacally)

508
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,240
- You crack me up.

509
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,709
You hide behind philosophy but you have

510
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:46,211
no loyalty.

511
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,380
It's not a half bad strategy.

512
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:51,049
Oh no, our owner's being destroyed (laughing).

513
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,187
- [Hackmon] Ordinemon stopped its rampaging

514
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,889
when it's partners appeared.

515
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,891
Perhaps it still has some shadow

516
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:01,393
of a conscience left.

517
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:03,662
- So she's taking a quick break.

518
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:06,097
She'll be back to destroying in a minute.

519
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:09,768
Just admit it, Homeostasis has tried and failed.

520
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:13,605
(sizzling)

521
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,077
No one can save this world now.

522
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,912
All hail its final destruction

523
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:23,848
and the rise of King Drasil.

524
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:27,185
(upbeat inspiring music)

525
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,294
- [Lilimon] After her, everyone.

526
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:44,769
(loud roaring)

527
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:46,738
(growling)

528
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:50,642
(singing in foreign language)

529
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:54,546
- No effect.

530
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,047
- [Joe] We're gonna need to crank it up

531
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,249
to the next level, you guys.

532
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,150
Let's go!

533
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:03,355
- MegaKabuterimon digivolve to...

534
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,123
- Lilimon digivolve to...

535
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:06,458
- Zudomon digivolve to...

536
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:08,927
- Garudamon digivolve to...

537
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,462
- WereGarurumon digivolve to...

538
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:14,366
(singing in foreign language)

539
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,737
- MetalGarurumon.

540
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,105
- HerculesKabuterimon.

541
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,172
- Phoenixmon.

542
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:22,107
- Rosemon.

543
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,677
- Vikemon, arctic blizzard.

544
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:32,984
- Garuru Tomahawk.

545
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:36,087
- Star-Light Explosion.

546
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:40,425
- Forbidden Temptation.

547
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:43,294
- Giga Blaster.

548
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:47,098
(blasts and crackling)

549
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:47,966
- Still nothing.

550
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,001
- Incredible.

551
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,337
Now what?

552
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:55,840
(screeching pulsations)

553
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:02,247
(loud explosion)

554
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,282
(roaring)

555
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:07,385
(Digimon whimpering)

556
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,831
- Our best shot didn't even make a dent.

557
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,803
- What if we can't stop this?

558
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,238
- Oh Meicoomon, what happened to you?

559
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,307
- I can't just stand here and do nothing.

560
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,277
- It's too dangerous.

561
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:35,947
- You do not lack for courage, digidestined.

562
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,048
- [Matt] Who are you?

563
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:40,218
- A messenger sent by Homeostasis .

564
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,520
Fear not, I am here as a friend.

565
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:46,791
- [Several] Mm hmm.

566
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:50,261
- Hackmon and it's mega form makes it...

567
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:51,496
(dramatic thump)

568
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,231
Jesmon!

569
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:55,500
(all gasping)

570
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:56,367
- Huh?

571
00:28:57,335 --> 00:29:00,171
(whirls and zaps)

572
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,577
(small explosion)

573
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,878
- (grunting) That was you.

574
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,413
- [Hackmon] Yes.

575
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,548
- (groans) you're not our friend.

576
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,851
You're the reason Tai isn't with us anymore.

577
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,119
- Take it easy.

578
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:15,320
(Mimi whimpers)

579
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,122
- King Drasil had predicted that the Libra

580
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:19,357
would destroy the real world.

581
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:22,093
If he was correct, then the key to destroying

582
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:25,029
both the real world and the digital world

583
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:27,866
must surely be what the Libra has now become.

584
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:32,370
- Ordinemon.

585
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,040
- [Hackmon] It is now far stronger than all of you.

586
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:39,177
But it cannot even control its own enormous power.

587
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,212
And it has no plan of direction.

588
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:44,215
It wanders aimlessly, destroying without purpose.

589
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:45,150
(Meiko whimpers)

590
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:48,219
In response, Homeostasis has implemented

591
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,221
its plan of last resort.

592
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:53,224
We cannot allow King Drasil to continue.

593
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:55,360
- What is this plan of last resort?

594
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:58,396
- It involves rebooting the real world.

595
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,031
(all gasp)

596
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:02,467
- Is that even possible? - A reboot?

597
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,302
We already did that.

598
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,571
- [Hackmon] The reboot you initiated

599
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,273
was only of the digital world.

600
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,108
The programming code of that world

601
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:13,244
and the real world are vastly different.

602
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:15,013
But the distortions transferred data

603
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:17,015
between the two and have caused damage

604
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:19,050
to the real worlds code.

605
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,085
The very structure of its basic code

606
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,353
has been rewritten.

607
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,391
According to my calculations, it will take

608
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:29,894
only 94 seconds to rewrite all code

609
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:32,130
and then the real world will transform back

610
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,032
into the Quantum Sea.

611
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,567
- The Quantum Sea?

612
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,603
- We must prevent that from happening,

613
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:41,372
for the survival of your world.

614
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:44,075
- So the first reboot wasn't enough?

615
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:46,277
- (gasps) Does that mean our Digimon will lose

616
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:47,645
their memories again?

617
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,582
- No, this time we can avoid that

618
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:53,017
by using the backup memory we made for them

619
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,119
after the last reboot.

620
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,922
The trouble is, a total reboots gonna reset

621
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:00,992
every single computer and electronic device, too.

622
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,327
It's digital Armageddon.

623
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,362
- [Hackmon] Issues relating to the everyday tools

624
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:06,431
of human beings are unimportant.

625
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:08,933
We are talking about the question of whether or not

626
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:11,436
humans in the real world will survive at all.

627
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:14,339
The reboot is the last hope for humanity.

628
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,342
- We have to save it by destroying it?

629
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,377
Will it even be our world anymore?

630
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:23,314
(solemn music)

631
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,320
(Kari whimpers)

632
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,557
- Oh, Kari, I wish there was something

633
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,925
I could do to help you.

634
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,262
So this guy thinks our planets hard drive

635
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,997
needs to be wiped clean?

636
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,331
Isn't that a little extreme?

637
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,267
- What would Tai do?

638
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,168
Would he believe him?

639
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:46,971
(several gasp)

640
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:49,474
- Well I'm sure of this, what Tai would be

641
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:52,010
focused on would be saving people.

642
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:53,444
And he'd work as hard as he could

643
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,246
to minimize any damage.

644
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,648
He'd find a way.

645
00:31:56,681 --> 00:32:00,051
- Sounds great, what do you think, Izzy?

646
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,653
- I think it's crazy.

647
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,554
Think about the electrical grid

648
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,323
and power plants and the gas lines

649
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,258
and the water supply and transportation

650
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,760
and even medical services.

651
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:10,361
Rebooting the real world would mean

652
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:11,996
shutting down every one of those things

653
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,264
all at the same time.

654
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:15,466
And Hackmon says all that's unimportant.

655
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,769
There's gotta be another solution.

656
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:20,538
And I'm gonna find it before this reboot happens.

657
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:22,974
- He has a point.

658
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:27,712
- Just the same, the reboot will begin

659
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:30,648
when Homeostasis decrees, but I do agree.

660
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:34,185
Ordinemon should not be allowed to further

661
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:35,720
damage this world.

662
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:38,423
Could you lure it away toward the ocean?

663
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,224
- (gasps) But, but how?

664
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,562
- Sorry, Meiko, but Hackmon is right.

665
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:46,731
Meicoomon or whatever she's called

666
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:49,667
is destroying everything and we have to stop her.

667
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:53,404
Look, you have the best shot as her partner.

668
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,239
Try to lead her away from the city.

669
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,209
- Well, wish me luck.

670
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,046
All right then.

671
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,583
(eerie rumbling)

672
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:10,688
- Gather around you guys.

673
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:12,657
We brought you some food, so dig in.

674
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,659
- There's nothing like food to cheer you up.

675
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:18,563
- (laughs) Tummy so happy.

676
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:19,464
- Yeah.

677
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:23,701
- Oh, my eyes were bigger than my thorax.

678
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,205
(slurping)

679
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:29,474
- Why do you eat so much, Agumon?

680
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,310
- Because eating is the funnest thing there is.

681
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,345
Plus I've got to be strong for when Tai

682
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,380
comes back.

683
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,849
(Mimi gasps)

684
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:38,716
(Agumon smacking)

685
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,550
- I hope you're right.

686
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,285
- I'm always right about food.

687
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,389
I wish I was as illogically positive as you are.

688
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:45,757
I'm so afraid we'll never see Gatomon

689
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,492
and Meicoomon again.

690
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,526
How do you do it?

691
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,762
Do you know some sort of secret to happiness?

692
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,731
- Mm hmm, my secret is eating.

693
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:57,235
(melancholy piano music)

694
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:04,709
- [Izzy] Oh, another dead end.

695
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:06,577
I have to keep looking.

696
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,212
If I could just figure out how to prevent

697
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:10,448
the reboot from happening.

698
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:12,283
I've gotta find something.

699
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:13,551
(computer buzzes)

700
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:14,485
(gasps) Anything.

701
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,888
(intercom chiming)

702
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,790
- Hey, Izzy, can I come and join you?

703
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,292
- [Izzy] Sure Tentomon, come on out.

704
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:23,428
(gulping)

705
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,131
- You sure took off in a hurry.

706
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:29,233
Is stopping Hackmon's plan that important?

707
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,701
- [Izzy] I feel like if I don't,

708
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,471
it's gonna mean the end of the human world.

709
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:35,373
Then again, maybe not.

710
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:38,509
You guys got rebooted and you're fine.

711
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,678
- Wait, I got rebootified?

712
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:42,180
Are you sure?

713
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,314
That sounds like the kind of thing

714
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,516
that would definitely leave a bruise.

715
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,252
- It's true, you just forgot.

716
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:50,788
That's the problem with rebooting.

717
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,723
Your memory can get wiped out.

718
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:56,194
That's why I don't wanna do it again.

719
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:59,263
(mellow piano music)

720
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,913
(groaning)

721
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,149
(sighs)

722
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:32,196
(sighs)

723
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,698
- [Mr. Nishijima] Who's there?

724
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:34,932
Is that you, Tai?

725
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:39,670
- Mr. Nishijima, where are you?

726
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,339
I hear you but I can't see anything.

727
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:42,340
- [Mr. Nishijima] Over here.

728
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:43,241
- Over where?

729
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,678
(gasps)

730
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,252
- You're all right.

731
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:56,921
I'm so glad.

732
00:35:56,954 --> 00:36:00,291
- But, you're hurt.

733
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,426
- [Mr. Nishijima] Yes, I wasn't as quick

734
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,861
as you, obviously, (groans).

735
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:07,698
- Don't try to stand.

736
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:09,700
- Where are we?

737
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:12,503
- Well, we're still in the digital world,

738
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:13,804
but I don't know where.

739
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:17,642
(digital whining)

740
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,911
(Tai gasps)

741
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:22,713
I knew it.

742
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,315
This isn't random.

743
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,850
Someone brought us here.

744
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,251
But why?

745
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,255
(gasps)

746
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:34,258
(eerie piano music)

747
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,663
Impossible, it's them.

748
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,666
It's Davis and Ken and it's all of them.

749
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:44,268
Are they alive?

750
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:45,303
- [Mr. Nishijima] I think so.

751
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,738
It looks like they're in suspended animation.

752
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:52,043
In fact, there's something else you need to know.

753
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:54,812
I couldn't tell you before.

754
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:55,846
- Huh?

755
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:00,551
- Davis, Ken, Yolei and Cody, the four of them

756
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:03,454
went missing a long time ago and I always wondered

757
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,056
what happened to them.

758
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:07,491
But then that intel was classified top secret.

759
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:10,895
Even their names were made confidential.

760
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:14,365
And all related information was kept under seal.

761
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,068
- Who gave the order to do that?

762
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:19,537
- It was Director Himekawa.

763
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,972
I didn't know it at the time but she was

764
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:23,407
cooperating with King Drasil.

765
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:24,709
So when these four learned about him

766
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:28,512
and what he was planning, she made them disappear.

767
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:31,515
In our last battle together, Himekawa's partner,

768
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,317
Tapirmon was sacrificed.

769
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:35,586
That loss broke something in Hime.

770
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,022
I think that's why she wanted to reboot

771
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:39,624
the digital world.

772
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:42,360
She thought it would bring Tapirmon back.

773
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:44,328
Nothing else really mattered to her.

774
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:48,499
- [Tai] Did it work?

775
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,335
- I don't know.

776
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:55,539
I don't even know if Hime is still alive.

777
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:59,810
Having a partner Digimon can save a person

778
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:03,414
or if things go wrong, it can drive them mad.

779
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,549
If only I'd seen where Himekawa was heading,

780
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,885
maybe things wouldn't have turned out this way.

781
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:15,059
Sometimes your best friends somehow become your enemies.

782
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:17,828
That's when the decisions get tough.

783
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,730
That's when we do things we never thought

784
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,432
we would be capable of.

785
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,034
(Tai gasps)

786
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:24,602
- Please kill her.

787
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,469
Just do it.

788
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,707
(Tai groans)

789
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,942
- [Dark Gennai] Beware when fighting monsters,

790
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:35,579
that you do not become a monster yourself.

791
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,817
If you gaze long enough into the abyss,

792
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,386
the abyss will gaze back into you.

793
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,889
Sounds like that was written about you.

794
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:46,624
(finger snaps)

795
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,159
- [Tai] Wait, what are you doing?

796
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:51,028
(alarm beeps)

797
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:55,032
- [Dark Gennai] Just a little program modification.

798
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,801
- [Dr. Tapirmon] He's turned off their life support.

799
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,602
- [Dark Gennai] Yes, they don't have long now.

800
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:00,771
But you can save them by transporting them

801
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,973
to the real world, if you hurry.

802
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,009
Because in a few minutes, this whole place

803
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:07,611
is gonna blow, kaboom!

804
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:09,814
(Tai gasps)

805
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,416
We've even prepared extra slots for you.

806
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,452
Wasn't that merciful of King Drasil?

807
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:16,454
But wait, what's this?

808
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:18,456
I only see one.

809
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:21,158
How can we make such a fatal error, (crying)?

810
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:24,995
(maniacal laughter)

811
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,565
I guess only one of you gets to go.

812
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:30,568
(sinister laughter)

813
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:36,040
I've been waiting for this day for a long time.

814
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:38,509
A chance to finally show you how pathetic

815
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,112
and powerless you humans really are.

816
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:42,980
By yourselves you can't do anything.

817
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:45,149
Without Digimon, you're worthless.

818
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:47,151
How does it feel to realize that?

819
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:49,787
On your own, you're nothing but clowns.

820
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,022
The digidestined are a joke.

821
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,192
(laughs maniacally)

822
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,862
(Dr. Nishijima grimaces)

823
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,664
You really should be ashamed of yourselves,

824
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,466
you wannabes, (laughs).

825
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,938
- Are you trying to stop it?

826
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,241
- Yes, I've gotta kill the program.

827
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:12,877
There has to be a way to override the sequence.

828
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,612
(computer beeps)

829
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:17,114
(Tai grunts)

830
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:20,985
(dramatic instrumental music)

831
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,058
Mr. Nishijima, see if you can find

832
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,727
the root directory on that computer.

833
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,694
- [Mr. Nishijima] Right.

834
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,532
Hey, Tai, I think I found a way to override

835
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:37,234
the transport and stop the self destruct sequence.

836
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,970
Go look at the controls inside the last cryo chamber.

837
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:41,005
The empty one.

838
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:41,672
- Okay.

839
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:45,676
(frantic instrumental music)

840
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,880
- Mr. Nishijima] Step all the way inside.

841
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:50,681
(door slams shut)

842
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:51,816
(Tai gasps)

843
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,084
- [Female Computer Voice] Transport system activated.

844
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,188
- Hey, Mr. Nishijima.

845
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:58,222
Something went wrong.

846
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,290
I'm trapped.

847
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:01,826
- [Mr. Nishijima] I'm sorry, Tai.

848
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,160
But if only one of us can go back

849
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:05,729
to the human world, it has to be you.

850
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:08,032
It has to be.

851
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,900
(alarms buzzing)

852
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,001
- Open the door.

853
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:17,208
Let me out of here.

854
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:19,043
We still have time to figure it out.

855
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:23,047
(grunting) Come on.

856
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,249
- [Mr. Nishijima] There's nothing here to figure out, Tai.

857
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:27,017
But you need to figure out what's happening

858
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,086
back home and make things right.

859
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,989
You kids are the only ones who can do it.

860
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:36,160
(tai grunting)

861
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:37,962
You just have to do the very thing

862
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,964
that you guys taught me to do.

863
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,565
To never give up.

864
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,067
To believe that no matter how bad

865
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,969
things get, there's always hope.

866
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,806
I think I understand that now.

867
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:49,673
Always hope.

868
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:53,744
I have to stay, you have to go.

869
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:55,312
- I can't.

870
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,114
- [Mr. Nishijima] Yes, you can, Tai.

871
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:59,149
You have to help your friends.

872
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,318
You kids are the future.

873
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,754
Your generation will write the next chapter.

874
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:06,624
Maybe for our entire world.

875
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,592
Maybe for the digital world, too.

876
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:11,595
So, dream big.

877
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,265
I believe in you.

878
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:16,967
(woeful music)

879
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,823
(loud blast)

880
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,169
(chopper blades whirring)

881
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:53,070
- [Pilot] Jet calling Delta.

882
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:55,172
You have friendly inbound on the bridge,

883
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:56,907
300 yards out to the east, over.

884
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:59,143
- [Delta] Roger that, chopper two.

885
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:00,344
We have visual, over.

886
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:02,646
Transport, you are clear on approach.

887
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,148
Checkpoint, Delta, out.

888
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:09,053
- Mei Mei, this is really brave of you.

889
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,955
- Thanks for stepping up.

890
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:13,857
- Well, I'm the right choice.

891
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:15,225
- Plus we're here to help you.

892
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,827
- You can count on it.

893
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:20,230
- You say that but I'm a little scared

894
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:23,200
we'll get swallowed up like Gatomon did.

895
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:25,069
(Digimon whimpering)

896
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:29,673
- Mm hmm, there's gotta be something

897
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:30,507
we can do.

898
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:33,777
I want Gatomon and Meicoomon back.

899
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:36,814
(Digimon whimpering)

900
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:39,083
- [Meiko] Oh no, look at the lights.

901
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,784
The city's entire electrical grid

902
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:42,319
is on its last legs.

903
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:44,154
It can't take much more of this.

904
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:46,890
Well, at least it'll be morning soon.

905
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:49,460
- But we don't have very much time.

906
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:52,663
Meiko, go ask Hackmon what he wants you to do.

907
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:58,002
- Should I go try to talk to her?

908
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:00,404
- No, that is not necessary.

909
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:02,106
All you have to do to lead her away

910
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,308
from the city is to walk away.

911
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:07,044
Ordinemon will go wherever you go.

912
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:11,115
- [Meiko] What makes you think that's still true?

913
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,851
The Meicoomon I knew is gone.

914
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:15,753
How do you know that creature up there

915
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:18,422
even recognizes me after all these changes?

916
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:20,257
- [Hackmon] Homeostasis believes the bonds

917
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:23,427
between Digimon and their partners are unbreakable.

918
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,830
They can survive any transformation.

919
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,098
(Meiko grunts)

920
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:30,901
- Assuming Homeostasis really is on our side.

921
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:32,503
I have my doubts.

922
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:36,473
- Homeostasis strives only for harmony and stability.

923
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,108
It does not take sides.

924
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:40,210
- Yeah, but what's that really mean?

925
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:44,214
Cause in that big battle, you certainly took sides.

926
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:46,483
You digivolved into Jesmon and tried

927
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,085
to destroy Meicoomon.

928
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:53,023
I'm sorry, I guess I don't have any right

929
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:55,292
to question what you're doing when it was my fault

930
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:57,895
for creating this whole problem in the first place.

931
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:01,932
- No need to apologize.

932
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:04,968
You are an innocent victim in this situation.

933
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:07,871
We involved you for our own reasons.

934
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:10,407
Personally, the reboot is not the course

935
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:12,376
of action I would choose.

936
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:15,045
(Meiko whimpers)

937
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,581
(ominous music)

938
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:22,386
- Poor Mei.

939
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:25,489
(rumbling)

940
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,829
(rumbling)

941
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:37,034
- [Joe] Oh, check it out, guys.

942
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,435
She's on the move again.

943
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:41,238
- Maybe Meiko can save her.

944
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:42,106
- Almost doesn't matter.

945
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,540
- What do you mean?

946
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,542
- Even if she stops, our world

947
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,177
is still in trouble. (Joe and Mimi gasps)

948
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:49,346
Homeostasis is obviously determined

949
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:51,181
to go through with the reboot.

950
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:53,450
- Yeah, and they think it's okay.

951
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:55,419
They know the results will be catastrophic,

952
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:56,854
but they don't seem to care.

953
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:58,288
- It's not their home.

954
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:02,226
King Drasil, Homeostasis , neither of them cares

955
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,961
about saving our world.

956
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:06,997
We're on our own. (all groan)

957
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:10,968
- If Ordinemon doesn't change back,

958
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:14,571
then what's going to happen to Meicoomon and Gatomon?

959
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,173
- But she's gotta change back.

960
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:18,108
- I know I'll be fine.

961
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:21,044
(mobile rings)

962
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:22,045
- It's Izzy.

963
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,080
What's up?

964
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,182
- [Izzy] Matt, you're not going to believe this.

965
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:27,384
Davis and Ken Yolei and Cody just came back

966
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:28,552
from the digital world.

967
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:29,987
- Are you kidding me? - Huh?

968
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,321
- [Izzy] I don't have all the details yet,

969
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:32,422
so I don't know who found them

970
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,490
or how they got out of there,

971
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:34,858
but they're here.

972
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:35,859
They're in a hospital and apparently

973
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:36,393
they're all right.

974
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:37,494
Can you believe it?

975
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:39,930
They've been in the digital world the whole time.

976
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,265
- That's crazy.

977
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,499
Okay, keep us posted.

978
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,103
(Kari moaning)

979
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:51,975
(Patamon chattering)

980
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:56,880
(Patamon yelps)

981
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:58,315
- You're awake.

982
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:00,083
Here, have some water.

983
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:07,124
- [Kari] Thank You.

984
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,525
- [T.K.] How are you feeling?

985
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:09,393
- Huh?

986
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:13,897
Like I might as well disappear again.

987
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:15,232
- Don't say that!

988
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:17,134
I'll always bring you back.

989
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,670
I wanna help you but you have to talk to me.

990
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:22,039
Don't let the sadness win.

991
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:24,308
(Kari groans)

992
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,578
Trust me, Kari, it's okay.

993
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:30,948
I'll always be here for you. (Patamon whimpers)

994
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:32,316
Always.

995
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,585
- You're touching, I didn't see anything,

996
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:37,154
I swear, I wasn't even in the same room.

997
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:40,290
(eerie rumbling)

998
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:41,158
(Kari gasps)

999
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,426
Ah, what's that?

1000
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:46,964
(all gasping)

1001
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:49,166
- [Kari] Gatomon is still in there somewhere.

1002
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,135
(rumbling)

1003
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:53,103
I have to go.

1004
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:55,239
I have to do something.

1005
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:59,610
- Meicoomon, come here.

1006
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:02,346
(waves crashing)

1007
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,915
(eerie music)

1008
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:20,097
(rumbling)

1009
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:21,632
(Meicoomon screeching)

1010
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:24,701
(roaring pulsations)

1011
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:30,007
(all grunting)

1012
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:38,649
(Meicoomon screeching)

1013
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:40,617
- [King Drasil] Ah yes, Ordinemon.

1014
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:42,719
Bring down all your friends to join

1015
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,354
our lovely party.

1016
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,491
(growling)

1017
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:48,992
(squawking)

1018
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:51,295
Together we will destroy this world completely.

1019
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,430
Let the humans weep and wail as they watch

1020
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:55,999
everything they have built burn to ashes.

1021
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:59,336
(King Drasil laughs maniacally)

1022
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,305
All hail King Drasil.

1023
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:04,074
(ominous music)

1024
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:08,011
(tinkling)

1025
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:14,318
(intense music)

1026
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:18,088
- Meicoomon, Gatomon, are you still in there?

1027
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:23,560
Have all the memories of your partners been erased?

1028
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:24,494
- Meicoomon!

1029
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:26,263
- Please remember!

1030
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:29,700
(Meicoomon roaring)

1031
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:32,369
- I'm sure our friends are still there somewhere,

1032
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:33,337
deep inside.

1033
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,137
- Yeah.

1034
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:36,473
- But if it comes right down to it,

1035
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:38,208
we may have to fight them.

1036
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:39,209
- Yeah, I know.

1037
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:40,644
- Are you with me?

1038
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:42,713
- But I can't digivolve.

1039
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:44,114
I need time.

1040
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,782
- That's okay, because there's still

1041
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,484
a lot of things you can do.

1042
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,519
There are some things we Digimon can do

1043
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:51,355
that no one else can.

1044
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:54,591
- [Agumon] You're right, and it's time we went into action.

1045
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:55,492
- [All] Hmm.

1046
00:49:58,528 --> 00:50:00,564
- Matt will make the right decision.

1047
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:03,533
We just have to make sure that when he does, we're ready.

1048
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:07,371
- [Both] Hmm.

1049
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:10,707
- Meicoomon and Gatomon are still our friends,

1050
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:12,509
this is not gonna be easy.

1051
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:20,350
- [Soldier] Should we strike, sir, or give it more time?

1052
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,219
- Time's up, send the men.

1053
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:25,222
- [Strike Force Soldier] Strike Force Delta here,

1054
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:26,623
what are your orders?

1055
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:28,725
(energetic music)

1056
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:32,195
Target acquired, all gunships, fire when ready.

1057
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,566
(energetic music)

1058
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:45,075
(soldier screaming)

1059
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:50,313
I've got a clean shot, here goes nothing.

1060
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:52,716
(Meicoomon roaring)

1061
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:55,752
(soldier screaming)

1062
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,591
- [Control] Chopper force, do not close engage target.

1063
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:04,327
Artillery units, you are clear to fire.

1064
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:07,297
Choppers, minimum distance, 300 yards.

1065
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,733
Stand off and fire rockets.

1066
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:10,834
(artillery firing)

1067
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:13,804
(explosions)

1068
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:16,773
(artillery fire)

1069
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:20,177
(Intense battle music)

1070
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:22,479
- Stop it!

1071
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:24,281
- Why are they shooting at her?

1072
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:26,249
- How are we ever gonna rescue her now?

1073
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:35,292
(rockets exploding)

1074
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:40,630
(digidestined gasping)

1075
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:48,872
All that firepower, and it didn't even slow her down.

1076
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:52,242
(upbeat battle music)

1077
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:02,519
- [Soldier] This is Chopper three,

1078
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:04,387
something's happening over here.

1079
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:07,424
(soldier screaming)

1080
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,825
- Gabumon, let's go.

1081
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:09,926
- You got it.

1082
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:10,961
- Gomamon.

1083
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:11,828
- I'm on it.

1084
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:12,729
- Palmon.

1085
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:13,597
- I'm good.

1086
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,232
- Biyomon, you ready?

1087
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:16,566
- Let's do this.

1088
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,269
(upbeat music)

1089
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:30,914
- [All] Digivolve to...

1090
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:35,285
(upbeat battle music)

1091
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:50,333
(singing in foreign language)

1092
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:51,301
- Togemon!

1093
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,269
- Birdramon!

1094
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:53,503
- Garurumon!

1095
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:55,539
- Ikkakumon!

1096
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:59,409
(singing in foreign language)

1097
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,531
- Weregarurumon!

1098
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:26,703
(roaring)

1099
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:28,572
Digivolve to...

1100
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:32,475
(singing in foreign language)

1101
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,616
(rapid gunfire)

1102
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:44,821
(singing in foreign language)

1103
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:47,390
(explosions)

1104
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:53,496
- [Soldier] Chopper force, retreat.

1105
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,512
(roaring)

1106
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:13,083
(singing in foreign language)

1107
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:15,785
(both panting)

1108
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:20,056
(growling(

1109
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,825
- It's time, you good?

1110
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:23,393
- Yeah.

1111
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:27,297
(singing in foreign language)

1112
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:37,607
- Patamon, digivolve to...

1113
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:41,478
(singing in foreign language)

1114
00:54:57,527 --> 00:54:58,895
Angemon!

1115
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:02,799
(singing in foreign language)

1116
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,642
Angemon, digivolve to...

1117
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:25,121
MagnaAngemon!

1118
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:32,829
(zapping and explosions)

1119
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:36,433
(growling)

1120
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:38,168
- There's so many of them.

1121
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:40,537
- How is MagnaAngemon supposed to

1122
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:41,604
fight all of that?

1123
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:47,110
(MagnaAngemon grunting)

1124
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:49,946
(MagnaAngemon yelling)

1125
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:51,014
(King Drasil laughing)

1126
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:54,451
- I guess he's not, does that answer your question?

1127
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:57,854
- (sighs) You again.

1128
00:55:57,887 --> 00:55:59,956
(King Drasil laughing)

1129
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:01,925
- If only you could see your faces.

1130
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:04,094
I'm glad to run into you, because I wanted to thank you.

1131
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:07,030
So nice of you to make my job easier.

1132
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:12,102
In fact, I have Kari to thank for all of this.

1133
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:13,703
You're the one who was so determined

1134
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:16,773
to stop Homeostasis from destroying Meicoomon

1135
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:18,775
that you kept your brother, Tai, from acting,

1136
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:20,810
and that solved my biggest problem.

1137
00:56:20,844 --> 00:56:21,911
- Lay off!

1138
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:23,613
- So, now you see how not being able

1139
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:25,081
to control your emotions can lead

1140
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:26,649
to serious problems.

1141
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:28,952
You freed me up to destroy your entire world,

1142
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:31,488
and that's exactly what I'm going to do.

1143
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:32,489
Wait for it.

1144
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:35,658
Almost.

1145
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,128
He's here!

1146
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:42,866
(grunting)

1147
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,675
(screaming)

1148
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:56,946
- MagnaAngemon, no!

1149
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,615
- Oh man, is that all you got?

1150
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:03,586
I was hoping you could play at a much higher level.

1151
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,989
- Please, no!

1152
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:11,194
(growling)

1153
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:13,730
(explosions)

1154
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:38,655
(footsteps approach)

1155
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:48,031
(eerie ambience)

1156
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:57,173
- [Meicoomon] Meiko.

1157
00:58:00,877 --> 00:58:05,281
- [Kari] It's showing me Meiko's memories, but why?

1158
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,851
(Kari gasps)

1159
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:13,223
(Meicoomon crying)

1160
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:14,123
- Gatomon.

1161
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:16,860
- It'll be all right.

1162
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:23,700
(Meicoomon gasps)

1163
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:25,902
- I'm so sorry.

1164
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:35,345
- I'm just here to give you a message, Kari.

1165
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:36,813
- What message, Gatomon?

1166
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,251
(kari gasps)

1167
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:43,753
Gatomon, what's happened to you?

1168
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:45,255
- This isn't about me.

1169
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:46,890
- Don't leave.

1170
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:48,791
- The bad things that have happened have been

1171
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:50,793
too much for Meicoomon.

1172
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:54,030
She's a gentle soul, and she suffered so much,

1173
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:55,698
more than any of us.

1174
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:57,166
She needs your help to end this.

1175
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,034
(Meicoomon crying)

1176
00:58:58,067 --> 00:59:00,870
She doesn't want to be scared anymore.

1177
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:02,972
Listen to me, okay?

1178
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:08,077
All the light you will need is inside Meicoomon.

1179
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:10,113
- Gatomon.

1180
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:15,184
(Kari gasps)

1181
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,653
- [T.K.] Good, you're awake.

1182
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:17,754
- Did I miss anything?

1183
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:21,925
- [T.K.] Just some more end of the world

1184
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:23,626
as we know it stuff.

1185
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:26,262
- [Kari] I saw Gatomon in some place filled with data,

1186
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:28,164
and she gave me a message.

1187
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:29,198
- What did she say?

1188
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:33,036
- All the light you will need is inside Meicoomon.

1189
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:35,672
I don't remember anything else.

1190
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:38,274
What do you think she was trying to tell me, T.K.?

1191
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:43,179
- Coming from Kari, it's probably some kind of prophecy.

1192
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:44,814
It sounds like one.

1193
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:45,815
Any idea what it means.

1194
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:46,749
- [T.K.] Nope.

1195
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:49,686
- She definitely has some strange powers.

1196
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:51,354
All the light you will need.

1197
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:53,423
(Izzy gasps)

1198
00:59:53,456 --> 00:59:54,724
Hold on a sec.

1199
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,292
(alarm chirping)

1200
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:58,261
I just got an alarm and some kind of countdown

1201
00:59:58,294 --> 01:00:00,129
on my screen, I think the reboots

1202
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:01,030
about to start.

1203
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:03,299
- Can't you just hit the snooze button?

1204
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:04,767
- Time to bug out, Tentomon.

1205
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:06,703
- Hey, that's my line.

1206
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:08,004
(roaring)

1207
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:10,173
- I've got you, WereGarurumon.

1208
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:17,780
- [Mimi] Get her, Togemon.

1209
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:20,917
(Togemon yelling)

1210
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,285
- Go!

1211
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:24,220
(WereGarurumon growling)

1212
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:26,422
(grunting)

1213
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:31,094
(intense battle music)

1214
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:44,374
(WereGarurumon growling)

1215
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:50,113
- Get in there!

1216
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,914
Go, Ikkakumon.

1217
01:00:51,948 --> 01:00:54,817
(Togemon yelling)

1218
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:07,930
- Firing needle spray!

1219
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:11,300
Take that, you overgrown mermaid.

1220
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:14,203
- [Birdramon] Multi fire missiles.

1221
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:20,810
I've got you, Togemon.

1222
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:36,192
(explosion)

1223
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,796
(grunting)

1224
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:53,142
(yelling)

1225
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:57,914
(Meicoomon roaring)

1226
01:01:57,947 --> 01:02:00,016
(groaning)

1227
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:02,285
(crackling)

1228
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:09,092
(loud thud)

1229
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:18,134
(all groaning and moaning)

1230
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:36,119
- This is a disaster, nothing we do

1231
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:37,787
has any effect on her.

1232
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:44,060
(artillery firing)

1233
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:51,534
(explosions)

1234
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:58,274
(Ordinemon roaring)

1235
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,212
(forlorn music)

1236
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:10,853
(squawking)

1237
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:12,889
- I've got you, Togemon.

1238
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:18,494
(fiery explosion)

1239
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:24,100
(forlorn music)

1240
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:26,469
(Mimi gasps)

1241
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:34,877
(multiple explosions)

1242
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:45,188
(large explosion)

1243
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:51,427
(electricity crackling)

1244
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:59,368
- [Kari] No, you have to stop this, Meicoomon, please.

1245
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:04,407
There's gotta be something we can do.

1246
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,475
- Hang on, my friend.

1247
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,878
(groaning)

1248
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:14,951
- Everything about this is wrong.

1249
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:17,086
If Tai were here, what would he do?

1250
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:19,121
- [Hackmon] It's beyond your control.

1251
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:21,157
The reboot has begun.

1252
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,659
All suffering will soon end.

1253
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,561
Homeostasis will make certain of that.

1254
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:27,063
- Shut up!

1255
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:29,498
Stop telling us how great this reboot is.

1256
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,301
Homeostasis has done nothing to help

1257
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:34,570
us since this whole thing started.

1258
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:37,607
We're gonna save the world our way, without you.

1259
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:41,978
(phone ringing)

1260
01:04:47,116 --> 01:04:48,651
All right, Izzy, what do you got?

1261
01:04:58,194 --> 01:04:59,629
- [Izzy] I'm glad you guys made it.

1262
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:01,230
Meiko, let me borrow your digi device for a sec.

1263
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:02,398
- [Meiko] Okay.

1264
01:05:02,431 --> 01:05:04,367
- Just as I thought.

1265
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,036
I've been trying to figure out the meaning

1266
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:08,638
of Kari's message.

1267
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:12,074
All the light you will need is inside Meicoomon.

1268
01:05:12,108 --> 01:05:13,542
- And what did you come up with?

1269
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:16,512
- Well, remember after the reboot

1270
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:18,347
of the digital world, how Meicoomon

1271
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:20,016
was the only one of our Digimon

1272
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:22,518
who didn't lose her memory?

1273
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:24,020
It really puzzled me.

1274
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:28,157
I knew what the reboot could do,

1275
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:30,660
so I had tried to back up all our Digimon's

1276
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:32,728
memories just in case.

1277
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:35,531
I noticed some of Meicoomon's code

1278
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:37,533
was mixed into Tentomon's.

1279
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:39,201
At the time, I just figured a digital

1280
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:41,370
glitch has caused it during battle,

1281
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:43,406
but later, I found some of her data

1282
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,408
in all of the Digimon.

1283
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:47,710
I just ran a complete diagnostic

1284
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:50,479
on Meiko's digi device, cross referencing

1285
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:52,748
every network and system and digital channel

1286
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:54,150
that I'm aware of.

1287
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:57,687
Take a look at this.

1288
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,255
This shows Meicoomon's carrying

1289
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:01,090
a massive amount of memory data

1290
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,526
from herself and from all of our Digimon.

1291
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:04,627
- All?

1292
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:06,595
Did you just say all?

1293
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:09,465
- So, their memories can get downloaded

1294
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:10,800
again somehow?

1295
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,735
Are Patamon's memories in there too?

1296
01:06:12,768 --> 01:06:14,136
- All there.

1297
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:17,506
- You know, I miss Meicoomon.

1298
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:18,607
I like her a lot.

1299
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:22,078
- Could it be?

1300
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:23,112
- Hi.

1301
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:25,348
- [Izzy] It might explain why meicoomon was able

1302
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:27,416
to grow so powerful so quickly.

1303
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:29,151
She had all our Digimon's data.

1304
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:31,387
- Must have been crowded in there.

1305
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:32,688
- [Izzy] I found something else in here too.

1306
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:35,691
I'm positive this folder must be special.

1307
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:38,260
It's the only one that's password protected.

1308
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:40,663
For the sake of argument, let's assume

1309
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:43,699
that fear is what causes Meicoomon to change.

1310
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:45,768
Remember when we first met her?

1311
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:48,571
She was child-like and bonded to Meiko.

1312
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:50,072
I believe the code containing

1313
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:51,640
her gentle spirit and good memories

1314
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:54,143
was corrupted and replaced by frightening

1315
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:55,578
dark data instead.

1316
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:58,447
If Meicoomon's original data is in that

1317
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:00,783
folder, I can use it to restore the memories

1318
01:07:00,816 --> 01:07:03,586
she had before fear made her violent,

1319
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:05,388
her memories of Meiko.

1320
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:06,522
- Well, get to it.

1321
01:07:06,555 --> 01:07:08,624
I don't want to experience the mother

1322
01:07:08,657 --> 01:07:09,759
of all reboots.

1323
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,560
- That's the best choice we've got.

1324
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:13,329
Nothing else has worked.

1325
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,797
Let's give it a try, Izzy.

1326
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:16,699
- But we don't know the password.

1327
01:07:16,732 --> 01:07:18,300
We don't even know whose password

1328
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:19,635
it is in the first place.

1329
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:20,836
- Actually we do.

1330
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,772
It's Meicoomon's password.

1331
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:25,341
We need you to think hard, Meiko.

1332
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:27,643
What password would Meicoomon use?

1333
01:07:27,676 --> 01:07:28,544
- I have no idea.

1334
01:07:28,577 --> 01:07:31,814
(background explosions)

1335
01:07:33,182 --> 01:07:33,816
(artillery gunfire)

1336
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:36,152
(zapping)

1337
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:48,330
(loud explosion)

1338
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:52,334
- Did she has a favorite saying?

1339
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:54,537
Did you have any special nicknames for her?

1340
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:55,871
- Nicknames.

1341
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:59,875
- Why don't we try your name? - [Izzy] M-E-I-K-O.

1342
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,277
(beeping)

1343
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:02,812
Okay, that's not it.

1344
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:03,679
Try again.

1345
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:04,547
(beeping)

1346
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:05,714
Mei?

1347
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:09,618
Nope, it's not any of the variations of Meiko's name.

1348
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:12,354
- [Mimi] Think of some word that meant a lot to her.

1349
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:14,523
- Come on, Meiko, we're running out of time.

1350
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:19,228
- Just think back to when you first met.

1351
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:20,429
Maybe there was something you said

1352
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:21,864
that she would have remembered.

1353
01:08:21,897 --> 01:08:23,799
Do you recall anything like that?

1354
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:31,173
(gentle piano music)

1355
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,586
(Meiko gasps)

1356
01:09:01,871 --> 01:09:05,407
(Meicoomon roaring)

1357
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:06,675
- [Soldier] This is chopper nine.

1358
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:08,344
The creatures are everywhere,

1359
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:10,746
they're coming right at us.

1360
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:12,348
- What was the password?

1361
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:14,283
- I had forgotten, but it was the first

1362
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:15,784
word I had taught Meicoomon,

1363
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,720
and the first thing I said to her.

1364
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:20,422
Because she had just agreed to be my partner.

1365
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:25,561
Thank you.

1366
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:27,596
We're so lucky we met all of you.

1367
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:29,899
What do you say to our new friends, Meicoomon?

1368
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:32,902
Dandan.

1369
01:09:32,935 --> 01:09:34,470
- Dandan.

1370
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:35,304
- Huh?

1371
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:35,971
Say what?

1372
01:09:38,474 --> 01:09:40,976
- That's thank you in Meicoomon speak.

1373
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:44,013
- [Mimi] You tried to pull one over on us.

1374
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:45,814
- [Matt] It's not Meicoomon speak.

1375
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:46,515
It's your dialect.

1376
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:48,684
- [Izzy] You guys, it's working.

1377
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:51,320
All the data's being transferred.

1378
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:52,988
- [Soldier] Model five report,

1379
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,857
what's going on down there?

1380
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:57,393
(soft music)

1381
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:24,587
(gasping)

1382
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:25,921
All units, hold your fire.

1383
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:27,690
I repeat, hold your fire.

1384
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:32,428
(mellow piano music)

1385
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:39,668
- What is all this?

1386
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:44,974
Is that Tai?

1387
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:47,476
I remember.

1388
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:49,812
I remember it all now.

1389
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:51,046
Tai.

1390
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,715
My partner.

1391
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:55,951
- It's all coming back.

1392
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:58,354
Matt and I went through so much together,

1393
01:10:58,387 --> 01:11:00,823
and it was so hard to say goodbye.

1394
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:01,724
So hard.

1395
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:08,464
- [Gabumon] Being with you always made me so happy, Joe,

1396
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:11,066
even though you didn't always understand why.

1397
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,443
- Oh, T.K., even when I was infected,

1398
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:24,113
you stayed with me the whole time.

1399
01:11:24,146 --> 01:11:25,748
I remember now.

1400
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:29,652
- Sora, look at us, we were great friends, weren't we?

1401
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:31,620
Now I know why you were being so kind to me.

1402
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:34,957
Can you ever forgive me for being so mean?

1403
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,460
- It's amazing.

1404
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:40,629
We spent so much time together, Izzy.

1405
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:43,432
And you worked so hard to get us here.

1406
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:46,001
I hope our stories are safe inside your big brain.

1407
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:52,541
- I can't believe how lovely all these memories are, Mimi.

1408
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:54,043
We're perfect together.

1409
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:56,712
We're going to be partners forever.

1410
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:03,085
- [Matt] Look, it's MetalGarurumon.

1411
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:04,486
- [Joe] There's Vikemon.

1412
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,587
- [Kari] And Rosemon.

1413
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:06,955
- [Mimi] Is that Pheonixmon?

1414
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:08,123
- [T.K.] There goes Seraphimon.

1415
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,726
- [Izzy] I see HerculesKabuterimon.

1416
01:12:10,759 --> 01:12:13,429
They all digivolved to mega level and are flying

1417
01:12:13,462 --> 01:12:14,096
to Ordinemon.

1418
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:25,074
- (gasps) Kari, I see you.

1419
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:26,508
I'm coming back to you.

1420
01:12:29,044 --> 01:12:31,447
(grunting)

1421
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:35,084
Kari!

1422
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:36,485
- It's Gatomon.

1423
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:43,592
- [Gatomon] What on Earth is happening,

1424
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,795
what is this?

1425
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:49,531
(ominous music)

1426
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:09,118
(static and explosions)

1427
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:11,854
(ominous music)

1428
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:20,562
(Meicoomon whimpering)

1429
01:13:29,171 --> 01:13:31,640
This was not expected.

1430
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:33,675
The awakening of old memories within the Libra

1431
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:36,078
has also given it new powers.

1432
01:13:36,111 --> 01:13:38,847
(all gasping)

1433
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:42,451
(mellow orchestral music)

1434
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:47,122
- She has all her memories again, right?

1435
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:49,491
So, why isn't she turning back into Meicoomon?

1436
01:13:49,525 --> 01:13:50,793
- Maybe it's gonna take a little more time

1437
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:51,894
for her to change.

1438
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:56,098
- [Izzy] It's not her size that's slowing it down,

1439
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:58,901
it's the size of all the data that's being restored.

1440
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:04,039
Years of memories created before the reboot

1441
01:14:04,072 --> 01:14:05,607
are being recovered and coming back

1442
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:09,178
to our Digimon, as well as to her, to Ordinemon.

1443
01:14:11,146 --> 01:14:14,116
Gatomon and Meicoomon's data will probably

1444
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:15,918
be the last piles to be recovered.

1445
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:19,655
- This is truly the power of the Digidestined.

1446
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:22,858
It's unbelievable.

1447
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:24,893
- [Izzy] Hackmon, stop the reboot.

1448
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:27,996
The data isn't completely restored yet.

1449
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:30,165
We just need a couple more minutes.

1450
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:33,535
If we're successful, the reboot won't be necessary.

1451
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:36,071
(intense music)

1452
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:58,861
- [Gatomon] Kari, help, it's pulling me back in.

1453
01:14:58,894 --> 01:14:59,728
- Gatomon.

1454
01:14:59,761 --> 01:15:03,265
(Gatomon yelling)

1455
01:15:03,298 --> 01:15:04,833
- No way.

1456
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:07,202
- [Izzy] Ordinemon is trying to restore harmony

1457
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:08,303
and stability.

1458
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:23,652
(Meicoomon roaring)

1459
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,655
- [T.K.] Less than two minutes until the reboot.

1460
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:27,756
Are we gonna make it?

1461
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:28,790
- I hope so.

1462
01:15:33,128 --> 01:15:34,897
Ordinemon is heading for that portal.

1463
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:36,365
If she goes through it, we'll never

1464
01:15:36,398 --> 01:15:38,800
see Gatomon or Meicoomon again.

1465
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:46,241
(Meicoomon roaring)

1466
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:50,812
- Don't go, don't leave me.

1467
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:56,885
(zapping)

1468
01:15:56,919 --> 01:15:58,754
- [T.K.] Something stopped her.

1469
01:15:58,787 --> 01:16:02,824
- [Matt] Jesmon.

1470
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:08,630
(whooshing)

1471
01:16:16,104 --> 01:16:18,674
(all gasping)

1472
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:20,876
(groaning)

1473
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:25,380
(Gatomon groaning)

1474
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:32,921
- Gatomon!

1475
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:39,895
I'm coming, hang on.

1476
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:41,096
I'm right here.

1477
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:57,012
You're safe now.

1478
01:16:57,045 --> 01:17:00,282
- Of course I am, I've got nine lives.

1479
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:03,218
(all chuckling)

1480
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:05,354
- I guess Homeostasis came through,

1481
01:17:05,387 --> 01:17:08,457
with only 11 seconds to go, the reboot countdown

1482
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:09,324
finally stopped.

1483
01:17:09,358 --> 01:17:10,692
- Then we made it.

1484
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:12,794
- What a relief, I was sweating.

1485
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:14,796
- So we're back to normal again?

1486
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:17,399
- No, we're not done.

1487
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:21,236
- [Kari] She's, she's still Ordinemon.

1488
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:24,406
Why didn't she turn back into Meicoomon?

1489
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:27,242
- It should have happened already.

1490
01:17:29,177 --> 01:17:31,246
- All the data's there.

1491
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:33,048
there must be something blocking

1492
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:36,018
the memories from integrating into her fractal code.

1493
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:39,388
What's this?

1494
01:17:39,421 --> 01:17:41,857
(squawking)

1495
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:49,431
Losing all those memories freed up a lot of space.

1496
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:50,465
- What's so bad about that?

1497
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:53,902
- Someone is uploading new files to Ordinemon.

1498
01:17:53,935 --> 01:17:55,971
It's King Drasil.

1499
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:57,372
- [King Drasil} (Laughs) That's right.

1500
01:17:57,406 --> 01:18:00,075
Say goodbye to your world and gaze upon the glory

1501
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:02,878
of King Drasil's paradise.

1502
01:18:02,911 --> 01:18:05,447
(ominous music)

1503
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:18,727
- (gasps) What did she ever to do deserve this?

1504
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:24,332
Stop, stop making her suffer.

1505
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:27,102
(intense music)

1506
01:18:32,274 --> 01:18:34,209
(rustling)

1507
01:18:34,242 --> 01:18:36,411
(groaning)

1508
01:18:37,913 --> 01:18:39,081
Meicoomon, no!

1509
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:51,126
- [Matt] Run, Meiko.

1510
01:18:52,861 --> 01:18:54,229
- I gotta help her.

1511
01:18:54,262 --> 01:18:56,031
- [T.K.] Hey, Agumon.

1512
01:18:58,366 --> 01:19:01,303
(Meiko whimpering)

1513
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,897
(singing in foreign language)

1514
01:19:29,865 --> 01:19:32,434
- I'm so happy to see you again.

1515
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:36,004
I've missed you.

1516
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:02,564
- You're late.

1517
01:20:06,368 --> 01:20:07,969
- Yeah, sorry.

1518
01:20:08,003 --> 01:20:09,404
But I'm here now.

1519
01:20:15,177 --> 01:20:17,212
Let's end this.

1520
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:19,147
- Yeah, you got it, tai.

1521
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:23,018
(singing in foreign language)

1522
01:20:31,193 --> 01:20:33,128
Agumon, digivolve to...

1523
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:37,933
(singing in foreign language)

1524
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:54,115
(roaring)

1525
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:56,251
Greymon!

1526
01:20:56,284 --> 01:21:00,121
(singing in foreign language)

1527
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:09,064
Greymon, digivolve to...

1528
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:23,011
MetalGreymon!

1529
01:21:24,613 --> 01:21:27,182
Metalgreymon, digivolve to...

1530
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:42,731
WarGreymon!

1531
01:21:42,764 --> 01:21:46,601
(singing in foreign language)

1532
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:54,442
WarGreymon, digivolve to...

1533
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:05,020
Omnimon!

1534
01:22:10,325 --> 01:22:14,296
- Tai, don't attack Meicoomon, she's one of us.

1535
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:15,130
- Oh, Kari.

1536
01:22:16,364 --> 01:22:17,165
- Don't do it.

1537
01:22:18,466 --> 01:22:21,169
Everyone has both good and evil inside.

1538
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:27,342
I just know the good part of Meicoomon

1539
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:29,110
is still alive.

1540
01:22:29,144 --> 01:22:30,712
You've got to find a way to make her

1541
01:22:30,745 --> 01:22:31,713
remember who she is.

1542
01:22:31,746 --> 01:22:32,747
Save her.

1543
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:40,689
- I hope you never change.

1544
01:22:43,558 --> 01:22:46,061
You might hate me for doing this,

1545
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:47,696
but this is how it has to end.

1546
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:50,799
(swooshing)

1547
01:22:50,832 --> 01:22:53,134
(zapping)

1548
01:22:57,339 --> 01:23:00,108
- We're no longer the Digidestined kids.

1549
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:03,478
Our destiny is ours to decide now.

1550
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:06,715
No matter how painful, we have to save our own future.

1551
01:23:09,451 --> 01:23:14,456
- Tai, if you destroy Meicoomon, I'll never forgive you.

1552
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:18,760
But you're still my brother, and if you think

1553
01:23:18,793 --> 01:23:22,630
this is the only way, then I'll battle alongside you.

1554
01:23:24,866 --> 01:23:27,736
- In that case, I'll join the fight too.

1555
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:31,106
(upbeat battle music)

1556
01:23:38,113 --> 01:23:41,216
- Gatomon, digivolve to...

1557
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,662
Angewomon!

1558
01:23:56,264 --> 01:23:59,200
Angewoman, digivolve to...

1559
01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:18,386
Magnadramon!

1560
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:19,287
(upbeat battle music)

1561
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,423
(zapping)

1562
01:24:22,457 --> 01:24:24,392
(explosions)

1563
01:24:24,426 --> 01:24:26,428
(groans)

1564
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,608
(yelling)

1565
01:24:41,709 --> 01:24:43,111
- Fire tornado!

1566
01:24:50,285 --> 01:24:52,687
(explosions)

1567
01:25:12,407 --> 01:25:14,542
- What does it mean?

1568
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:24,752
Please be merciful.

1569
01:25:27,922 --> 01:25:30,525
- [Izzy] Look, Omnimon's gathering the power

1570
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:32,193
of all our Digimon.

1571
01:25:33,595 --> 01:25:36,397
(majestic music)

1572
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:45,840
- [all] Whoa.

1573
01:25:45,874 --> 01:25:47,408
- [Kari] Check it out.

1574
01:25:47,442 --> 01:25:48,510
- [Meiko] Look at that.

1575
01:25:48,543 --> 01:25:50,678
(zapping)

1576
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:55,350
(majestic music)

1577
01:26:06,961 --> 01:26:08,263
- [Joe] Pro...

1578
01:26:08,296 --> 01:26:09,631
- [Izzy] Digious.

1579
01:26:10,598 --> 01:26:13,601
(high energy music)

1580
01:26:30,718 --> 01:26:33,655
(Meicoomon yelling)

1581
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:37,992
- [Tai] It's almost over.

1582
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:39,360
- [Matt] Yeah.

1583
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:43,364
(Meicoomon yelling)

1584
01:26:53,575 --> 01:26:55,810
(sizzling)

1585
01:26:58,012 --> 01:27:00,348
(roaring)

1586
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:02,817
- Yeah!

1587
01:27:07,956 --> 01:27:09,857
(zaps)

1588
01:27:32,347 --> 01:27:34,515
(yelling)

1589
01:27:38,686 --> 01:27:41,556
- Oh, Meicoomon, I can't save you.

1590
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:45,994
- [Meicoomon] Meiko.

1591
01:27:50,365 --> 01:27:52,367
I'm here.

1592
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,801
- You're alive.

1593
01:27:53,835 --> 01:27:54,702
- Mm-hmm.

1594
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:58,906
- Oh, I understand.

1595
01:28:01,075 --> 01:28:01,909
- Dandan.

1596
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:08,383
(Meiko crying)

1597
01:28:08,416 --> 01:28:12,020
Don't cry, Meiko, it's all right.

1598
01:28:13,054 --> 01:28:16,357
(Meicoomon laughing)

1599
01:28:27,035 --> 01:28:29,737
(Meiko crying)

1600
01:28:31,873 --> 01:28:34,976
(sorrowful music)

1601
01:28:35,009 --> 01:28:37,812
(waves crashing)

1602
01:29:07,041 --> 01:29:10,478
- [Meiko] Dandan, Meicoomon.

1603
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:19,787
- Oh well, it was fun while it lasted.

1604
01:29:19,821 --> 01:29:21,656
Such beautiful destruction.

1605
01:29:22,623 --> 01:29:24,826
(laughing)

1606
01:29:26,961 --> 01:29:29,564
But there's always tomorrow, right?

1607
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:34,435
You can find a little child inside everyone.

1608
01:29:34,469 --> 01:29:36,738
A little child is ready to play.

1609
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:45,980
Oh well, Daemon could be next,

1610
01:29:46,013 --> 01:29:47,782
or even Diaboromon.

1611
01:29:54,689 --> 01:29:57,058
(Meiko sighs)

1612
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:02,797
- [Gabumon] Matt.

1613
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:05,466
- [Gatomon] Kari. - Well look whose back.

1614
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:06,868
- [Mimi] Tentomon.

1615
01:30:09,003 --> 01:30:10,805
- I think I'm hungry.

1616
01:30:13,508 --> 01:30:15,743
- [Patamon] No more fighting, right, T.K.?

1617
01:30:15,777 --> 01:30:17,011
- [Mimi] Let's all go home.

1618
01:30:24,886 --> 01:30:26,587
- [T.K.] Hi, Meiko.

1619
01:30:26,621 --> 01:30:27,789
I can't believe it's been three months

1620
01:30:27,822 --> 01:30:30,491
since you left and went back to Totori.

1621
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:31,993
The city was really a mess, as you know.

1622
01:30:32,026 --> 01:30:35,663
All the damage is taking a long time to fix.

1623
01:30:35,696 --> 01:30:38,232
But life is slowly getting back to normal around here.

1624
01:30:40,234 --> 01:30:42,904
We heard Homeostasis finally shut down King Drasil.

1625
01:30:43,971 --> 01:30:45,573
The other Digidestined kids who came

1626
01:30:45,606 --> 01:30:48,242
back from the digital world are fine,

1627
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:49,877
but the people around here still don't

1628
01:30:49,911 --> 01:30:50,812
trust Digimon very much.

1629
01:30:54,949 --> 01:30:56,584
Izzy's working on a system that will

1630
01:30:56,617 --> 01:30:58,019
let us go between the human world

1631
01:30:58,052 --> 01:30:59,253
and the digital world without

1632
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:01,722
using any type of digi devices.

1633
01:31:01,756 --> 01:31:02,657
Amazing, huh?

1634
01:31:06,327 --> 01:31:08,029
I hope we can all go to the digital world

1635
01:31:08,062 --> 01:31:09,797
together someday.

1636
01:31:09,831 --> 01:31:11,732
That would be great.

1637
01:31:11,766 --> 01:31:14,802
Until then, please take care of yourself.

1638
01:31:20,341 --> 01:31:22,109
- Tai's going to cram school?

1639
01:31:22,143 --> 01:31:25,580
- Yeah, Kari told me about it the other day.

1640
01:31:25,613 --> 01:31:28,149
He changed his college plans. - Really?

1641
01:31:28,182 --> 01:31:29,784
- He said it was because of something

1642
01:31:29,817 --> 01:31:31,719
that Mr. Nishijima told him,

1643
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:35,556
how we have to create our own futures.

1644
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:37,992
- Well, that's one hell of a homework assignment.

1645
01:31:41,729 --> 01:31:43,931
- What future do I want?

1646
01:31:43,965 --> 01:31:44,832
Hmm.

1647
01:31:47,635 --> 01:31:49,637
- If we really get to choose, then I'll

1648
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:51,272
head out to space.

1649
01:31:51,305 --> 01:31:53,674
- Sora, I like your new hairstyle.

1650
01:31:53,708 --> 01:31:54,742
- Really?

1651
01:31:54,775 --> 01:31:55,610
Thanks.

1652
01:31:55,643 --> 01:31:57,278
- Huh, is it different?

1653
01:31:57,311 --> 01:31:59,580
- Brother, you are hopeless.

1654
01:31:59,614 --> 01:32:01,182
- hey, they all came together.

1655
01:32:01,215 --> 01:32:02,350
Yay!

1656
01:32:02,383 --> 01:32:04,785
(giggling)

1657
01:32:06,287 --> 01:32:08,256
- [Matt] Well, you gonna call or what?

1658
01:32:11,092 --> 01:32:12,927
And don't say anything stupid.

1659
01:32:13,828 --> 01:32:16,130
(phone ringing)

1660
01:32:16,163 --> 01:32:18,799
- [Meiko] Tai, is that you?

1661
01:32:18,833 --> 01:32:20,134
- [Tai] Uh, yeah.

1662
01:32:20,167 --> 01:32:22,603
- [Meiko] How have you been?

1663
01:32:22,637 --> 01:32:25,606
- [Tai] Fine, everybody's fine.

1664
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:28,743
- It's been a long time since we talked.

1665
01:32:28,776 --> 01:32:30,077
- Yeah.

1666
01:32:30,111 --> 01:32:32,380
- [Meiko] It's good to hear from you.

1667
01:32:32,413 --> 01:32:33,981
- Good to be heard.

1668
01:32:34,015 --> 01:32:35,349
Did the box come?

1669
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:36,851
- Yes, it got here today.

1670
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:39,153
That was so nice of you.

1671
01:32:39,186 --> 01:32:41,622
I certainly wasn't expecting you guys to each

1672
01:32:41,656 --> 01:32:43,157
send me a Christmas present.

1673
01:32:44,759 --> 01:32:45,593
Thanks.

1674
01:32:46,327 --> 01:32:47,161
- You're welcome.

1675
01:32:52,967 --> 01:32:54,068
- [Sora] What's with the silence?

1676
01:32:54,101 --> 01:32:55,770
- Come on, get to the point.

1677
01:32:55,803 --> 01:32:57,805
- I knew we should have given him notes.

1678
01:32:57,838 --> 01:32:58,673
- Tai.

1679
01:32:58,706 --> 01:32:59,240
- Okay, okay.

1680
01:33:00,441 --> 01:33:04,211
Listen, Meiko, I know we all went through a lot together.

1681
01:33:04,245 --> 01:33:05,846
I think about it all the time.

1682
01:33:07,148 --> 01:33:09,050
No matter what--

1683
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:09,750
- [Sora] Keep going.

1684
01:33:09,784 --> 01:33:10,952
(shushing)

1685
01:33:10,985 --> 01:33:15,790
- [Tai] What I'm trying to say is, no matter what, uh...

1686
01:33:15,823 --> 01:33:17,725
- Oh come on.

1687
01:33:17,758 --> 01:33:20,695
No matter what happens, we'll be friends forever.

1688
01:33:22,096 --> 01:33:23,230
You think she heard me?

1689
01:33:24,732 --> 01:33:29,003
- [Meiko] Oh, Agumon, I'd know that voice anywhere.

1690
01:33:29,036 --> 01:33:30,371
- [Tai] Maybe in the future we should

1691
01:33:30,404 --> 01:33:32,673
let Agumon handle the phone calls,

1692
01:33:32,707 --> 01:33:35,843
because he kind of wrapped up the way everybody

1693
01:33:35,876 --> 01:33:37,645
here feels about you, Meiko.

1694
01:33:38,379 --> 01:33:39,747
- Aww.

1695
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:41,816
- So heart wrenching.

1696
01:33:41,849 --> 01:33:44,251
- [Meiko] Thanks, dandan.

1697
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:45,453
- [Sora] Look, it's snowing.

1698
01:33:45,486 --> 01:33:46,988
- [Palmon] So pretty.

1699
01:33:47,021 --> 01:33:48,756
- [Mimi] Can I talk to Mei Mei, next?

1700
01:33:48,789 --> 01:33:49,724
- [Sora] No, me first.

1701
01:33:49,757 --> 01:33:50,891
- [Joe] Hey, what about me?

1702
01:33:50,925 --> 01:33:52,827
- [Matt] Hand over that phone.

1703
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:53,761
- [Kari] No way.

1704
01:33:53,794 --> 01:33:54,762
- [Biyomon] Good luck.

1705
01:33:54,795 --> 01:33:57,698
- [Gomamon] I never get to talk, not a word

1706
01:33:57,732 --> 01:33:59,100
this whole episode.

1707
01:33:59,133 --> 01:34:00,334
- [Joe] Gomamon.

1708
01:34:00,368 --> 01:34:02,236
- [Tai] You guys.
