1
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:07,955
(light electronic music)

2
00:00:19,997 --> 00:00:22,497
(bird crying)

3
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:42,334
(dramatic orchestral music)

4
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,862
(laughing)

5
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:11,956
(upbeat pop music)

6
00:01:11,956 --> 00:01:15,789
(singing in foreign language)

7
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:26,122
- Darling!

8
00:01:28,285 --> 00:01:29,118
Darling!

9
00:01:56,806 --> 00:01:59,473
(clock chiming)

10
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,627
(alarm blaring)

11
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:20,312
- [Man] Come on, move it.

12
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:25,989
What's your problem, move it.

13
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:27,319
- [Man Over Loudspeaker]
This is an announcement

14
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,543
from the School Festival
Executive Committee.

15
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:32,140
Will representatives of
all classes and clubs

16
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,690
please come to laboratory
number three immediately.

17
00:02:36,363 --> 00:02:37,196
- Pull!

18
00:02:38,094 --> 00:02:40,264
Pull as hard as you can!

19
00:02:40,264 --> 00:02:42,283
Put your backs into it!

20
00:02:42,283 --> 00:02:43,950
- [Man Over Loudspeaker]
To the representatives

21
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,350
of all classes and clubs,

22
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,440
from the Festival Committee,

23
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,200
when using carts in the hallways,

24
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,440
please observe the speed limit.

25
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,883
Use of bicycles and
motorcycles is prohibited.

26
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,220
The school store will be open

27
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,510
during the School
Festival as Hama Teashop.

28
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,220
Today, we're having our
big Festival Eve Special!

29
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,330
Featuring Ramen Lite!

30
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,507
Less filling, but it's a whopping 30% off!

31
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:05,927
- [Woman Over Loudspeaker]
Between nine o'clock

32
00:03:05,927 --> 00:03:09,467
and 11 o'clock, the Central
Staircase is only for going up.

33
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:12,200
- [Man Over Loudspeaker] To all students!

34
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,940
This is the Discipline Committee!

35
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,266
Wearing costumes before School
Festival Day is prohibited!

36
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:18,143
- [Kid] Hey, you!

37
00:03:18,143 --> 00:03:18,976
In the Baltan suit!

38
00:03:18,976 --> 00:03:20,388
Move it!

39
00:03:20,388 --> 00:03:22,721
(screaming)

40
00:03:31,453 --> 00:03:32,286
- [Man Over Loudspeaker] To all students,

41
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:33,330
from the Festival Committee,

42
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,050
will all girls please leave
the building by 10 o'clock.

43
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:40,019
Repeat, all girls please leave
the building by 10 o'clock.

44
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,080
- But do you really think anyone'll come

45
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,960
to a place that looks like this, Megane?

46
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,030
- [Chibi] Maybe we should have gone

47
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,837
for the Hot Babes Coffee Shop

48
00:03:46,837 --> 00:03:48,920
like Ataru suggested.

49
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,200
Lum gave it her okay too, after all.

50
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,293
- I won't have Lum acting like a bimbo.

51
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:56,180
Besides, do you know how hard it was to

52
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,090
collect money from everyone
in class to open this place?

53
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,590
I'll be shot before I'll let it be

54
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,190
operated according to
Ataru's weird tastes.

55
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,790
- Weird tastes, he says.

56
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,050
- Speaking of whom, where's our fearless

57
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,730
leader goofing off now?

58
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,320
- [Chibi] Lum just went looking for him,

59
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,040
so he should be back soon.

60
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,873
- I swear.

61
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:14,938
- Hey, I'm sorry, but I gotta split soon.

62
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:17,410
I have to get the Hama Teashop ready

63
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,690
for the festival as well.

64
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,909
- [Mendou] Okay, thanks for your help.

65
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:20,860
- Oh, brother.

66
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,870
Looks like we'll be
staying here again tonight.

67
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,960
- [Chibi] We've got a real
manpower shortage here!

68
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,311
No wonder, considering
how unpopular Ataru is.

69
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:30,884
- Hey, you guys still goofing around?

70
00:04:30,884 --> 00:04:35,360
When in eternity is your
shop gonna be ready, morons?

71
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,930
- So don't goof around, work!

72
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:37,763
Got it?

73
00:04:37,763 --> 00:04:38,596
- What the?

74
00:04:38,596 --> 00:04:39,429
- Hey!

75
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:41,600
We have tons of things to do
before tomorrow's opening!

76
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,311
So quit slacking off, and get--

77
00:04:44,311 --> 00:04:45,300
(gasping)

78
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,133
Huh?

79
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:47,070
- Oh.

80
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:47,903
- Huh?

81
00:04:47,903 --> 00:04:49,174
What's wrong with you?

82
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:50,050
(laughing)

83
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,870
Hey, isn't it a great idea?

84
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,690
If I go out looking like this, and really

85
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,760
toady up to the crowd?

86
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,541
We'll have a stampede of costumers.

87
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,708
(yelling)

88
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:01,860
- What's that?

89
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,994
Toadying up to the
crowd, looking like that?

90
00:05:04,994 --> 00:05:07,423
Moroboshi, get out here now!

91
00:05:08,337 --> 00:05:12,046
- Sir, could you avoid causing
any unnecessary shocks?

92
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:14,980
Even with the options
removed to make it lighter,

93
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,310
this Leopard still weighs about 40 tons

94
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,360
and I won't be held responsible for it

95
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,690
if it drops through the floor.

96
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,930
- What did you say?

97
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,110
Hey, Mendou!

98
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,911
I don't know if this
is an exhibit, or what.

99
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:27,482
but I didn't give any permission
to bring a tank in here!

100
00:05:27,482 --> 00:05:30,840
- So you say, but there's
nothing to be done,

101
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,172
as it's already here.

102
00:05:32,172 --> 00:05:36,980
Or maybe you would prefer
to just confiscate it?

103
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,593
- [All] Confiscate,
confiscate, confiscate!

104
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:42,128
- Shut up!
