1
00:00:44,817 --> 00:00:47,608
[RIN] I always wanted
to be like my dad.

2
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,483
[RIN, RIN'S DAD laughing]

3
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:58,275
[RIN'S DAD] Rin, when on
earth did you get so big?

4
00:00:58,358 --> 00:00:59,733
You're gonna grow up strong.

5
00:00:59,817 --> 00:01:01,358
I'd bet money on it.

6
00:01:01,442 --> 00:01:03,525
[BOTH laugh]

7
00:01:03,608 --> 00:01:04,942
Daddy!

8
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:06,900
Oh.

9
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,317
Who's this?

10
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,025
My favorite daughter,
Gou! Ready to fly?

11
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:18,275
[RIN'S DAD] All right.
Hang on tight! Ally-oop!

12
00:01:18,358 --> 00:01:20,483
--[GOU] Bestest biceps!
--[RIN] Super strong!

13
00:01:22,608 --> 00:01:24,900
[GOU]
Read this book to me?

14
00:01:24,983 --> 00:01:26,900
[RIN'S DAD]
"And then, they finally reached

15
00:01:26,983 --> 00:01:28,650
the island of the demons."

16
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:30,275
Then, the demons came out?

17
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:32,442
That's right.
There were a lot of em.

18
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:35,067
Oh, wait. I can
count them for you!

19
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,317
One, two, three...

20
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,608
[RIN'S DAD]
Whoa, what an amazing counter!

21
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:43,150
[RIN]
Gou and I loved our father.

22
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,400
Look! Those're panties!

23
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:49,733
[laughs] No, they're swimsuits.

24
00:01:49,817 --> 00:01:52,567
When Daddy was little, he
competed in a lot of swim meets,

25
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,442
and, of course,
he won all the time!

26
00:01:55,525 --> 00:01:57,358
[BOTH gasp]

27
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:00,150
[RIN]
Welcome home!

28
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:01,108
[RIN'S DAD]
Aw, thanks.

29
00:02:01,192 --> 00:02:03,108
You won all the time!

30
00:02:03,192 --> 00:02:04,858
Yeah, Mommy told us
how you did swim meets

31
00:02:04,942 --> 00:02:07,733
back when you were a kid
and you always won.

32
00:02:07,817 --> 00:02:09,692
She said you were the strongest!

33
00:02:09,775 --> 00:02:12,150
I wanna swim, just like you!

34
00:02:15,858 --> 00:02:17,400
[RIN'S DAD]
Okay, then.

35
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,483
[RIN'S DAD]
Yes, that's perfect!

36
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:24,942
--[BOTH laugh]
--You kids are so good!

37
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,650
[gasps]

38
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:31,900
No fair! I want one.

39
00:02:31,983 --> 00:02:33,192
Gimme one, too, Daddy!

40
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:35,817
You can have one
next time, okay?

41
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,400
[RIN] All I wanted was to
eventually be just like him.

42
00:02:41,442 --> 00:02:44,275
[RIN] I thought those days
would continue forever.

43
00:02:46,692 --> 00:02:49,858
[RIN] I wanted them
to continue forever.

44
00:02:49,942 --> 00:02:51,358
But then...

45
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:58,775
[RIN'S DAD] Don't worry, we're
not going that far out today.

46
00:02:58,858 --> 00:02:59,942
I'll be right back.

47
00:03:00,025 --> 00:03:01,442
[MIYAKO]
Be careful.

48
00:03:04,775 --> 00:03:06,067
Mommy?

49
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,442
[MIYAKO]
Sorry, hon. Did I wake you up?

50
00:03:08,525 --> 00:03:11,733
Look at the clock.
It's not moving.

51
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:15,358
[MIYAKO] Oh, yeah, it stopped.
Hope it's not broken.

52
00:03:19,275 --> 00:03:21,567
[MIYAKO] We'll be right back
after I drop off her clothes.

53
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,108
I'll be fine, Mom.

54
00:03:23,192 --> 00:03:25,733
Tell Grandma I hope she starts
feeling better really soon.

55
00:03:25,817 --> 00:03:27,067
[MIYAKO]
I'll tell her.

56
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:40,358
[phone rings]

57
00:03:40,442 --> 00:03:42,317
Mom, you home?

58
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:47,108
[RIN]
Hello?

59
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:50,067
[MAN]
Uh, Matsuoka's boy, right?

60
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,233
Now, try to stay calm, son.

61
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:54,358
No one expected the
weather to get so bad.

62
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,608
Your father's boat

63
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:56,733
that left the fishing
harbor this morning--

64
00:03:56,817 --> 00:03:58,192
it's been shipwrecked.

65
00:03:58,275 --> 00:04:00,442
We can't get ahold of rescue,
but even if we could,

66
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:02,858
the waves are too
dangerous to send help.

67
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,775
[RIN] In an instant,
my whole world changed.

68
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:32,233
[RIN] I was just so,
so sad. My heart hurt.

69
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:35,900
[RIN]
But--

70
00:04:45,025 --> 00:04:47,317
[RIN]
I wanted to support them.

71
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:52,733
[RIN]
I had to become stronger.

72
00:05:12,192 --> 00:05:14,775
[SOSUKE]
You were really fast just then.

73
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:17,192
You wanna race
me now, don't you?

74
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:19,983
Sure, ready to lose?

75
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:44,983
[RIN]
At that tournament.

76
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:47,900
[RIN]
That guy was there.

77
00:08:17,317 --> 00:08:18,483
Haru! Ow.

78
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:20,567
Why'd you just stop
out of nowhere?

79
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,067
'Cuz the light.

80
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:25,275
Jeez, maybe you should try
looking in front of you, Asahi.

81
00:08:25,358 --> 00:08:26,692
It's not like I can help that!

82
00:08:26,775 --> 00:08:27,900
'Cause of our meet today,

83
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:30,442
my vontage is now like
off the charts high!

84
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:33,067
You sure you didn't mean
your "voltage" is high?

85
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,275
Stupid.

86
00:08:34,358 --> 00:08:36,192
[gasps] Oh, shut up,
and stop acting like...

87
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:37,400
[IKUYA]
Will you let me go?!

88
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,733
[MAKOTO] Both of you,
please knock it off!

89
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:40,775
[NAO]
Hurry.

90
00:08:40,858 --> 00:08:42,233
You guys had better
get a move on.

91
00:08:42,317 --> 00:08:43,775
You'll be late to
the practice meet.

92
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:45,108
Seriously?

93
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:48,067
You just did your team
best a little while ago.

94
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,692
What're you doing?

95
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:52,775
[NAO chuckles] At least you're
in sync with relay exchanges.

96
00:08:52,858 --> 00:08:53,775
[IKUYA]
Not by choice.

97
00:08:53,858 --> 00:08:55,275
[ASAHI]
What did you say?!

98
00:08:55,358 --> 00:08:58,900
[MAKOTO] Stop it, for real!
We don't need any injuries!

99
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:32,233
[MIKOSHIBA] You don't look
all that scary anymore.

100
00:10:32,317 --> 00:10:34,025
[RIN]
Huh?

101
00:10:34,108 --> 00:10:35,275
You're kidding me, right?

102
00:10:35,358 --> 00:10:37,025
I can't be captain!

103
00:10:37,108 --> 00:10:38,233
[MIKOSHIBA]
It's my call.

104
00:10:38,317 --> 00:10:39,692
I'm not qualified.

105
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:41,108
I mean, leading
the whole team...

106
00:10:41,192 --> 00:10:45,233
[MIKOSHIBA] Quit whinin'.
I thought you wanted this.

107
00:10:45,317 --> 00:10:46,483
Well, I--

108
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:49,442
Look, this is me sayin'
I believe in you.

109
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:54,150
[MIKOSHIBA]
Matsuoka.

110
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:55,442
Yes, sir.

111
00:10:55,525 --> 00:10:58,150
Starting tomorrow morning,
you call the shots.

112
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:03,733
That means you're
the new captain.

113
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,275
[RIN]
Yes, sir.

114
00:11:09,483 --> 00:11:11,150
I didn't see that one coming.

115
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:12,650
Rin's far from
the obvious choice

116
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:13,817
for Mikoshiba's replacement.

117
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,733
Are you crazy?
His body's in top shape!

118
00:11:15,817 --> 00:11:18,192
If that's not a captain's
physique, I don't know what is!

119
00:11:18,275 --> 00:11:20,733
[REI] No one's saying he
doesn't look fantastic.

[SASABE]
Hm.

00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,983
I guess.

Huh? Oh, hey, there!
You lookin' to join up?

126
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,442
I won't be operational
for another month,

127

but we're accepting
membership applications.

[SOSUKE]
No, thanks.

129
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:56,317
[RIN] To make it on
the Samezuka Swim Team,

130
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,150
you need to beat the
benchmark time, no exceptions.

131
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:00,233
Pay attention to form.

132
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:01,817
Pick a style you
feel comfortable with

133
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,108
and show us what you got.

00:14:12,775 --> 00:14:14,150
You look a bit preoccupied.

stop callin' me sir.

139

But--

140
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:19,650
Just drop it.

[NITORI]
Yes, si-- Uh, okay.

142

There's a ton of people here.

143
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:25,358
I didn't know we'd
stirred up so much hype.

144
00:14:25,442 --> 00:14:26,858
[RIN]
Maybe they wanna catch a glimpse

145
00:14:26,942 --> 00:14:29,358
of the "world-class athlete"
Mikoshiba was talking about.

146
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:31,233
Do you think there's a chance
he's here right now?

147
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:32,900
I dunno, but keep
standing here you might

148
00:14:32,983 --> 00:14:34,483
lose your place to a First Year.

149
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:35,942
Oh! Right!

150
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:38,608
[NAGISA]
How's it goin', Rin?

151
00:14:38,692 --> 00:14:40,483
I'm good. What's up, Nagisa?

152
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:43,983
[NAGISA laughs] You think you'll
be free after practice today?

153
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:45,192
Let's see.

154
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:47,483
I don't have anything
planned. I guess so.

155
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:48,817
That's perfect.

156
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,608
Do you wanna come do
something fun with us, then?

157
00:14:50,692 --> 00:14:52,275
Somethin' fun, huh?

158
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,358
[REI] Nagisa, wait!
You should invite him properly!

159
00:14:55,442 --> 00:14:57,608
Rin doesn't want us
to be like that with him.

So how come you do?

Oh, hey, Haru.

[HARUKA] Come to
Iwatobi High around dusk.

You wanna race because we
got the same times again?

Show up or don't.

You don't have to be like that.

I'll come when I finish
checkin' the practice regimen.

Huh.

[gasps]

189
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,108
Remember that time in school,
about your dream?

190
00:16:12,192 --> 00:16:14,567
You wanted to swim in a
pool of cherry blossoms.

191
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,900
Our original plan was to
spruce up the pool a little

192
00:16:16,983 --> 00:16:19,067
as an advertisement
aimed at new members.

193
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,817
Miss A got us permission
to open it early.

194
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,317
But no one came, so the
work was all for naught.

195
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,858
[MAKOTO] Seemed like a shame
to let the end result

00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:29,483
go to waste, so, we, uh, y'know,
thought you'd appreciate it.

Not to be ungrateful,

for a swim, don't you think?

Duh! Wait a second.

If you know Rin, do you know
Nanase and the others, too?

00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,858
We haven't seen each other
since the sixth grade.

298

He hasn't met Haru
and the gang yet.

299

Well, that's not exactly true.

300
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,108
I've competed with him before.

301
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:28,400
I learned a lot about my
own limits as a swimmer.

302
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:30,817
If you're not careful,
he's the type of rival

303
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,358
you can become obsessed with.

304
00:20:32,442 --> 00:20:34,317
Uh--

305
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,525
Freak.

306
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:38,858
Look at him go!

307
00:20:38,942 --> 00:20:40,525
He can get his torso higher
above the water's surface

308
00:20:40,608 --> 00:20:42,400
than most swimmers--
decreases the resistance

309
00:20:42,483 --> 00:20:44,233
he'd have to deal
with otherwise.

310
00:20:44,317 --> 00:20:46,150
And his shoulder
flexibility isn't somethin'

311
00:20:46,233 --> 00:20:48,067
that happens overnight.

312
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,858
The guy's a beast.
He's worked hard to get there.

313
00:20:50,942 --> 00:20:52,442
So, that must mean Sosuke

314
00:20:52,525 --> 00:20:55,817
is the world-class swimmer
Mikoshiba was telling us about!

00:20:57,192 --> 00:21:00,025
That's right, and when
I watch him swim...

316
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:02,233
...it brings back memories.

[RIN, SOSUKE panting]

318
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:06,692
[RIN]
It's so hot!

319
00:21:06,775 --> 00:21:08,108
[SOSUKE]
No kidding, right?

320
00:21:08,192 --> 00:21:09,608
Which one of these you want?

321
00:21:09,692 --> 00:21:11,817
[BOTH]
On your mark, get set. Go!

322
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:15,567
[RIN, SOSUKE]
Rock, paper, scissors!

323
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,775
Best two out of three!
Winner takes all!

324
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:19,900
[laughs] I'm gonna
get brain freeze.

325
00:21:19,983 --> 00:21:21,275
Ugh. Whatever.

326
00:21:21,358 --> 00:21:24,025
If we'd done butterfly,
I'd 'a had this in the bag.

327
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:25,275
Oh, yeah?

328
00:21:25,358 --> 00:21:26,567
You wanna see which one
of us has better form?

329
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,192
I'm always up for a race.
You don't scare me.

330
00:21:29,275 --> 00:21:30,442
All right.

331
00:21:30,525 --> 00:21:31,525
Let's make it interesting
and say the loser

332
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:34,192
has to do whatever
the winner wants.

333
00:21:34,275 --> 00:21:35,858
Hey, sounds like
a solid plan to me.

334
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:38,358
Cool. We've got a deal, then.

335
00:21:38,442 --> 00:21:40,442
Last one to the pool
is a monkey's uncle!

Hey! Hold on!

337
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,067
You can't just take off
like that! I wasn't ready!

338
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,108
This is so cheating!

339
00:21:47,358 --> 00:21:49,233
[MAKOTO]
"Sprashu Fes"?

340
00:21:49,317 --> 00:21:50,858
Uh, what is that
supposed to say?

341
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,108
Is it like a culture
festival or something?

342
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:55,150
[SASABE chuckles] Oh,
there'll be lots of fun stuff

343
00:21:55,233 --> 00:21:56,942
goin' on here--you'll see.

344
00:21:57,025 --> 00:22:00,233
And you guys are gonna
get to help out.

345
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:01,650
[NAGISA]
All right!

346
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:04,192
Let's come up with something
cool for the main event!

347
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:05,775
[GOU]
What about a dog-paddle race?

348
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:07,192
[NAGISA]
Could be fun.

349
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:08,317
[REI] I'll go you one better:
how about a competition

350
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,233
to see who does
the best butterfly?

351
00:22:10,317 --> 00:22:13,150
We can call it
"Butterfly of Beauty!"

352
00:22:13,233 --> 00:22:15,400
[GOU] A muscle contest
would be pretty cool.

353
00:22:15,483 --> 00:22:16,817
Oh, come on!

354
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,900
Is there nothing you can't
work your obsession into?

355
00:22:17,983 --> 00:22:19,567
[laughs]

356
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,858
You're pretty quiet.

357
00:22:20,942 --> 00:22:23,900
Any ideas floatin'
around in there?

358
00:22:23,983 --> 00:22:25,525
We could do a relay.

359
00:22:25,608 --> 00:22:27,358
[ALL]
Huh?

360
00:22:27,442 --> 00:22:28,733
[MAKOTO]
That's a fantastic idea!

361
00:22:28,817 --> 00:22:30,233
People would lose their minds!

362
00:22:30,317 --> 00:22:32,233
I believe we have
ourselves a winner!

363
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:33,400
[GOU]
It'll give everyone a taste

364
00:22:33,483 --> 00:22:35,275
of how we'll kill
it at Regionals!

365
00:22:35,358 --> 00:22:36,525
[MAKOTO]
True.

366
00:22:36,608 --> 00:22:38,150
We'd need to find a team
to race against, though.

367
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:40,358
And why are you callin' it that?

368
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,817
[BOTH]
Pretty please?

369
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,942
[RIN] I'll say this for them--
they're a carefree bunch.

370
00:22:47,025 --> 00:22:48,608
Drives me nuts.

371
00:22:48,692 --> 00:22:49,650
Yeah, you complain,

372
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:51,733
but we both know
you're gonna do it.

373
00:22:55,317 --> 00:22:56,608
[SOSUKE]
Who you takin' with you?

374
00:22:56,692 --> 00:22:58,525
[RIN]
It's not like an official match.

375
00:22:58,608 --> 00:23:00,650
Finding people will be a pain.

376
00:23:00,733 --> 00:23:01,900
[SOSUKE]
Count me in.

377
00:23:02,942 --> 00:23:05,525
Wait. Seriously?

378
00:23:05,608 --> 00:23:07,358
Sure. Why not?

379
00:23:09,608 --> 00:23:11,275
[SOSUKE]
I'll do freestyle.

380
00:23:11,358 --> 00:23:12,608
That's fine by me.

381
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:15,858
You sure you don't wanna
go with butterfly, though?

382
00:23:15,942 --> 00:23:18,817
I feel like expanding
my area of expertise.

383
00:23:23,608 --> 00:23:25,900
[RIN]
Come on.

384
00:23:25,983 --> 00:23:28,317
[NITORI]
Bad news, sir--I mean, Rin!

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
What's up?

386
00:23:29,483 --> 00:23:30,692
[NITORI]
Nakagawa.

387
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:32,858
He-He got detention
for goofing off in class,

388
00:23:32,942 --> 00:23:33,983
so he can't make it!

389
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:36,775
Argh. You're kidding me, right?

390
00:23:36,858 --> 00:23:39,150
We can't do a relay with
just the three of us.

391
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:40,525
I know, it's terrible!

392
00:23:40,608 --> 00:23:41,942
We don't have time
to find anyone else!

393
00:23:42,025 --> 00:23:43,567
The race is in half an hour!

We're screwed.

can swim the backstroke?

[SOSUKE]
I'll just go twice.

397
00:23:50,525 --> 00:23:52,733
It's not like this is an
official event or anything.

398
00:23:52,817 --> 00:23:55,358
There's some leeway to fudge
the usual competition rules.

399
00:23:55,442 --> 00:23:56,733
Look, it may not be
the real deal,

400
00:23:56,817 --> 00:23:58,650
but it's still a race.
There's no point in doin' it

take it seriously.

[RIN] I'm gonna go out
on a limb and say that's

408
00:24:11,525 --> 00:24:12,608
not a common name.

from out of the blue,

[MOMOTARO]
Yeah, so?

You, swim the
backstroke like him?

Um. Well, yeah.
That's sorta my area.

423
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,442
Matter of fact, back home, I won
tons of competitions and stuff.

424
00:24:40,525 --> 00:24:43,400
Swimming the backstroke made
me kinda like a celebrity!

425
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:46,567
I had an awesome
nickname and everything.

Yeah. Guess he wanted to pave
the way for him or whatever.

to join the Swim Team.

00:26:18,608 --> 00:26:20,775
Right? I can't even
remember the last time.

472
00:26:20,858 --> 00:26:22,608
I guess transferring
to a new school means

473
00:26:22,692 --> 00:26:23,942
you get to treat the old crew

474
00:26:24,025 --> 00:26:25,692
like they fell off
the face of the earth.

475
00:26:25,775 --> 00:26:27,775
Not that Rin bothered to stay
in touch with anyone.

476
00:26:27,858 --> 00:26:29,317
Well, you know.

477
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:29,983
[GOU]
Yes I do.

478
00:26:30,067 --> 00:26:31,108
Should we know him?

479
00:26:31,192 --> 00:26:32,775
Sosuke's an old friend of Rin's.

480
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:33,858
They used to be teammates

481
00:26:33,942 --> 00:26:36,067
in the Sano
Elementary Swim Club.

482
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,317
He was actually in a lane
next to ours when we all

483
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,608
swam that relay together
back in the day.

484
00:26:40,692 --> 00:26:42,358
Talk about a blast
from the past.

485
00:26:42,442 --> 00:26:43,358
See you guys in the water?

486
00:26:43,442 --> 00:26:44,233
Of course.

487
00:26:44,317 --> 00:26:45,025
Yep!

488
00:26:45,108 --> 00:26:46,358
Let's go.

489
00:26:47,692 --> 00:26:48,942
Momotaro Mikoshiba!

490
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:50,650
I love nature!
I collect stag beetles!

491
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:52,317
My mantra is
"never stop swimming."

492
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,275
I can cook an egg five
different ways--not poached,

493
00:26:54,358 --> 00:26:56,025
that's a pain--and the
first place I wash when I--!

494
00:26:56,108 --> 00:26:57,733
[RIN]
Shut your trap. Move your feet.

495
00:26:57,817 --> 00:26:59,650
[MOMOTARO]
I'm tryin' to have a life!

496
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:08,692
Something I can help you with
while you're standing there?

497
00:27:08,775 --> 00:27:11,192
Hey. Long time, Nanase.

498
00:27:11,275 --> 00:27:14,692
So I saw what happened in the
relay at Regionals last year.

499
00:27:14,775 --> 00:27:15,692
Didn't know you were there.

500
00:27:15,775 --> 00:27:17,025
Had nothing better to do.

501
00:27:17,108 --> 00:27:18,442
I gotta tell you,
what you and your boys

502
00:27:18,525 --> 00:27:19,817
pulled out there was insane.

503
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,400
Can't believe Rin played along.

504
00:27:22,483 --> 00:27:24,442
Going somewhere
with this, or what?

505
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,108
I'd have never made him
do something so crazy.

506
00:27:36,025 --> 00:27:38,025
What are you trying to say?

507
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,650
If you know what's good for you,
you'll stay out of Rin's way.

508
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,317
[AMAKATA]
All right, ladies and gentlemen!

509
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,650
We come now to the main event:
a 200-meter medley relay!

510
00:27:59,733 --> 00:28:03,108
Let's hear it for Team
Dolphin and Team Shark!

511
00:28:03,192 --> 00:28:04,567
[MOMOTARO]
Hey!

512
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,483
I think the guy yelling is
Mikoshiba's little brother,

513
00:28:06,567 --> 00:28:08,400
they say his
backstroke's incredible.

514
00:28:08,483 --> 00:28:09,567
Huh. Small world.

515
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:10,650
[NAGISA]
Oh, and apparently Rin's

516
00:28:10,733 --> 00:28:12,150
going with butterfly today.

517
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:13,817
[REI]
That's certainly a 180!

518
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,150
[NAGISA]
No kidding, right?

519
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:17,358
That's why Yamazaki's
gonna be doin' freestyle.

520
00:28:18,775 --> 00:28:20,775
[SASABE]
Get set.

521
00:28:20,858 --> 00:28:23,442
--[whistle blows]
--[CROWD] Go!

522
00:28:23,525 --> 00:28:25,358
Nice one! There ya go!

523
00:28:25,442 --> 00:28:27,067
That's how ya start a race!

524
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,692
Wasn't sure he had it in him.

525
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:31,733
Kid pulled a nearly
perfect backstroke.

526
00:28:31,817 --> 00:28:33,858
[REI] He's got nothing on
Makoto for speed, though.

527
00:28:33,942 --> 00:28:35,483
And here he comes.

528
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:39,275
You swimming breaststroke
today, Aye-Aye?

529
00:28:39,358 --> 00:28:41,275
Bold choice.

530
00:28:41,358 --> 00:28:43,275
Please. You don't scare me.

531
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:48,733
Look at us.

532
00:28:48,817 --> 00:28:49,942
That's why all those hours
of training pay off.

533
00:28:50,025 --> 00:28:51,192
I guess so.

534
00:28:51,275 --> 00:28:53,108
[REI] They're about to
get their butts kicked.

535
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:56,483
[MAKOTO] Nagisa's always
faster in the second round.

536
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:58,233
That's when we'll close the gap.

537
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,025
Hate to break it
to you, my friend,

538
00:29:01,108 --> 00:29:03,025
but I believe we've got
this one wrapped up.

539
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,358
Heh.

540
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:06,358
Dive in first if you want to--
doesn't bother me.

541
00:29:06,442 --> 00:29:09,442
Watch your back once
you get goin', though.

542
00:29:09,525 --> 00:29:10,567
If you're not careful,

543
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,150
the water will sink
its teeth into ya.

544
00:29:12,233 --> 00:29:14,192
Wha--?

545
00:29:14,275 --> 00:29:16,275
I suggest you worry
about yourself.

546
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,150
Rei against Rin--
talk about a race!

547
00:29:22,233 --> 00:29:24,108
[MAKOTO] Little by little,
Rin's gaining on 'im.

548
00:29:24,192 --> 00:29:25,733
Man, he's fast!

549
00:29:31,358 --> 00:29:33,650
[NITORI] Rin's catching up!
He's gonna overtake him!

550
00:29:33,733 --> 00:29:35,608
All he needed was
a second, and boom!

551
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:37,150
Guy's some kinda super hero!

552
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,733
Why do you think your
brother made a big deal

553
00:29:38,817 --> 00:29:42,067
about handing the reins over
to him once he'd graduated?

554
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,650
[SASABE]
It's gonna be close!

555
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,400
[SASABE]
Atta boy, Rei!

556
00:30:05,817 --> 00:30:07,650
[REI] There's barely any
gap between them!

00:30:07,733 --> 00:30:10,233
He's keeping pace with
Haru. That's incredible!

I'm sorry!

I guess my heart just
wasn't in the race.

568
00:30:44,733 --> 00:30:46,733
For your first relay,
you actually did pretty good.

If by "next time," you mean
you wanna join the team,

00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,358
we could use a guy with
your backstroke skills.

No one kills it on butterfly
like Yamazaki, huh, sir?

doin' now is impressive,

to quit holdin' back.

his backstroke speed
is totally off the rails!

broke the club record!

You hafta' promise--

Yeah, I got it.
Let's do this already.

Ugh. Fine. I lose, you chose.

Hey, there's no need

Maybe.

Well, how 'bout lettin' me
sleep on the bottom bunk?

That doesn't count.
We competed for that

the other day and I won. C'mon.

Don't go wastin' my promise

Fine. Give me the rest

Let me ask you something.

How come I never heard
from you in all that time?

671

What happened over there?

You didn't call.
You stopped writing.

It was like you fell off
the face of the earth.

For all I knew, you had.

I didn't push back then
'cause I didn't wanna

676
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:51,483
get all up in your

But, I mean, now...

It wasn't anything major.

I hit a wall with the swimming.

Life can be rough when
you're the new kid.

I thought about saying goodbye
to swimming altogether.

Until... Haru stepped in
and kinda woke me up.

in love with the water again.

in a whole new light.

It's like, with them,
I recaptured that spark, y'know?

00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:36,775
I don't swim for myself anymore.

Not really.

Huh? Well, I guess they're
both equally important.

It's not that cut and dry.

the people who've
helped me get here.

[RIN gasps]

I don't wanna be on
relay anymore, period.

787
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,733
If I have to worry about
the other guy all the time,

788

it's gonna kill what
I get out of swimming.

Back then, yeah,
that's what I thought.

791
00:39:41,608 --> 00:39:43,275
I was just a dumb kid.

Thing is, now I'm not so sure.

I need to figure this out.
Maybe relay is how.

794

Sometimes you don't know
what you're looking for

That's not how it works.
There is no guarantee.

So, if you think swimming
relay will be some kind of

812
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,983
spiritual awakening,
you'll have to earn it.

you'll accept me

if I can beat you in a race.

Let's do it, then.

00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,567
[RIN]
All right. Listen up.

832
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,900
It's time for all of us to
start thinkin' about District.

833
00:41:53,983 --> 00:41:56,275
And just so you know,
I'm makin' some changes

834
00:41:56,358 --> 00:41:59,358
to the way we decide who gets
to be on the relay team.

835
00:41:59,442 --> 00:42:01,025
It used to be based on speed--

836
00:42:01,108 --> 00:42:03,817
if you were consistently fast,
you made the cut.

837
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,025
But that's not how we're
gonna do it this year.

838
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:09,567
Whether you swim relay
or go solo is your call.

839
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:11,817
So from now on, you'll
only be picked for relay

840
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,525
if that's your thing.

841
00:42:13,608 --> 00:42:16,025
Your overall speed
is still important,

842
00:42:16,108 --> 00:42:18,775
but just as important
is where your heart is.

843
00:42:18,858 --> 00:42:20,692
Sure, this might
be a stupid idea.

844
00:42:20,775 --> 00:42:22,817
Times are usually
the best way to go.

845
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,317
A few of you probably think
I'm sacrificing our chances

846
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,233
of winning for the sake of
proving some kind of point.

847
00:42:28,317 --> 00:42:29,442
And you're right.

848
00:42:29,525 --> 00:42:32,942
But it's a point that
needs to be made.

849
00:42:33,025 --> 00:42:34,442
We're a team.

850
00:42:34,525 --> 00:42:37,608
And if our mutual passion
isn't what binds us together,

851
00:42:37,692 --> 00:42:39,317
we could get all the way
to Nationals and have

852
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,900
nothing to show for it
but some stupid medals.

853
00:42:41,983 --> 00:42:44,067
More importantly, you deserve
to be led by someone

854
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:46,858
who sees this team as a family.

855
00:42:46,942 --> 00:42:48,275
So, you wanna swim relay,

856
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:50,900
you show me you
believe in yourself.

857
00:42:50,983 --> 00:42:53,442

in your team!

I'm kidding.

940
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:15,567
[GOU]
Yes. Perfect.

941
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:25,442
Hey, hurry up.

942
00:47:25,525 --> 00:47:28,358
Everybody's waiting for you.

943
00:47:28,442 --> 00:47:30,233
Right.

944
00:47:30,317 --> 00:47:32,275
What, you can't decide?

945
00:47:32,358 --> 00:47:34,733
Not that it's my call,
but after the crap he pulled

946
00:47:34,817 --> 00:47:37,983
out there today, Uozumi
clearly needs to be benched.

947
00:47:40,067 --> 00:47:41,942
Yeah, yeah, I hear ya.

948
00:47:45,192 --> 00:47:45,900
[RIN]
Uozumi.

949
00:47:45,983 --> 00:47:46,692
Sir!

950
00:47:46,775 --> 00:47:47,358
[RIN]
Momo.

951
00:47:47,442 --> 00:47:48,817
Sir!

952
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,442
I know you both have strong
feelings about the relay,

953
00:47:50,525 --> 00:47:53,483
but unfortunately only
one of you can do it.

954
00:47:53,567 --> 00:47:55,608
After looking at the results
from today's races,

955
00:47:55,692 --> 00:47:57,650
we need to make
some tough choices.

956
00:47:57,733 --> 00:48:01,233
Keep our sights on Regionals.

957
00:48:01,317 --> 00:48:03,733
Momo.

958
00:48:03,817 --> 00:48:05,233
You're on.

959
00:48:05,317 --> 00:48:07,233
[gasps]

960
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:09,567
Tch.

961
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:10,608
Uh!

962
00:48:10,692 --> 00:48:11,317
[UOZUMI]
Yo.

963
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,567
Uh, yeah?

964
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:14,858
I'll never forgive you
if you screw this up.

965
00:48:14,942 --> 00:48:18,025
Get out there and kick
some butt for Samezuka.

966
00:48:18,108 --> 00:48:20,108
Awesome! Heck yeah! You got it!

967
00:48:20,192 --> 00:48:20,983
Watch me!

968
00:48:21,067 --> 00:48:22,150
[UOZUMI]
That's more like it!

969
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,483
Ow! Come on!

970
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,108
But, one of these days,
somebody's gonna teach you

971
00:48:25,192 --> 00:48:26,650
a lesson, ya cocky little jerk!

972
00:48:26,733 --> 00:48:28,317
[RIN]
Here's the lineup for the relay:

973
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,317
Momo, Iwashimizu, Sosuke, me.

974
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,358
You guys ready for this?

975
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:33,150
[SOSUKE, MOMOTARO, IWASHIMIZU]
Sir!

976
00:48:33,233 --> 00:48:34,317
[RIN]
Okay.

977
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,275
That's it for our
post-race "debriefing."

978
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:38,525
I want you all to go home
and rest up for tomorrow.

979
00:48:38,608 --> 00:48:39,358
Understood?

980
00:48:39,442 --> 00:48:40,942
[SAMEZUKA CLUB]
Yes, sir!

981
00:48:42,775 --> 00:48:44,358
[NITORI sighs]

982
00:48:48,192 --> 00:48:49,192
You're in the way.

983
00:48:49,275 --> 00:48:51,525
[NITORI gasps]
Uh. Sorry about that.

984
00:48:55,025 --> 00:48:57,483
[NITORI laughs]

985
00:48:58,942 --> 00:49:00,733
Ya know.

986
00:49:00,817 --> 00:49:04,483
I can't believe I actually
let an underclassman beat me.

987
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:07,317
You really wanna be in
the relay that badly, huh?

988
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,108
[NITORI]
It's only natural.

989
00:49:09,192 --> 00:49:11,025
[SOSUKE]
What is?

990
00:49:11,108 --> 00:49:13,400
[NITORI]
Look, I-I just...

991
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:17,192
From the second I laid eyes
on him, Rin's been my hero.

992
00:49:17,275 --> 00:49:19,858
To tell you the truth,
when I first started swimming,

993
00:49:19,942 --> 00:49:22,067
I couldn't have cared less
about medley relay.

994
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:24,150
It was just another
race, y'know?

995
00:49:24,233 --> 00:49:25,650
But now, I realize

996
00:49:25,733 --> 00:49:27,775
there's a lot more
to it than that.

997
00:49:27,858 --> 00:49:30,817
This past year, I've had the
opportunity to witness firsthand

998
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,108
how much Rin truly
cares about it.

999
00:49:33,192 --> 00:49:35,108
Swimming with him inspires me.

1000
00:49:35,192 --> 00:49:37,067
I wanna make him proud.

1001
00:49:40,692 --> 00:49:43,192
What sucks is,
this was my big chance

1002
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:45,400
to make it happen.

1003
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:49,025
And after this summer,
I'll never get another one.

1004
00:49:49,108 --> 00:49:51,192
[SOSUKE]
And who exactly decided that?

1005
00:49:51,275 --> 00:49:53,608
[gasps]

1006
00:49:53,692 --> 00:49:56,067
[SOSUKE] If you wanna
swim with him that badly,

1007
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:59,317
then you figure out a way
to make that dream a reality.

1008
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,108
Don't limit yourself, kid.

1009
00:50:08,525 --> 00:50:09,817
Thanks!

1010
00:50:12,983 --> 00:50:14,942
Here goes.

1011
00:50:15,025 --> 00:50:18,275
Huh? He's already asleep?

1012
00:50:18,358 --> 00:50:20,733
Momo, it's too
early to be in bed.

1013
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,983
All right, let's see.

1014
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,525
Okay, look, I thought this
was my moment to shine,

1015
00:50:30,608 --> 00:50:32,108
but it turns out it's yours.

1016
00:50:32,192 --> 00:50:34,900
So go out there and win
this tournament for me!

1017
00:50:34,983 --> 00:50:36,692
[gasps]

1018
00:50:38,483 --> 00:50:39,900
[sighs]

1019
00:50:48,317 --> 00:50:50,692
[RIN] Ya know, it's been quite
a while since we've done

1020
00:50:50,775 --> 00:50:53,150
a real tournament together.

1021
00:50:53,233 --> 00:50:54,733
Yeah.

1022
00:50:54,817 --> 00:50:57,275
[RIN]
Let's win. Sound like a plan?

1023
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:01,525
[SOSUKE] Of course.
That's why we swim. Right?

1024
00:51:03,858 --> 00:51:05,775
Heh! Whaddup, Nitori!

1025
00:51:05,858 --> 00:51:07,650
[NITORI]
Oh, hey. You forget something?

1026
00:51:07,733 --> 00:51:09,608
[MOMOTARO] No, it's just--
I want you to know

1027
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:11,442
I'm gonna do my
best to win today!

1028
00:51:11,525 --> 00:51:14,525
[laughs] Wish me luck!

1029
00:51:14,608 --> 00:51:16,025
Uh... Huh?

1030
00:51:16,108 --> 00:51:17,692
[ANNOUNCER 7A]
Attention, ladies and gentlemen.

1031
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:21,900
We will now begin the men's
400-meter medley relay race.

1032
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:25,608
[RIN] Until... Haru stepped in
and kind of woke me up.

1033
00:51:25,692 --> 00:51:27,400
He and his buddies.

1034
00:51:27,483 --> 00:51:31,483
[SOSUKE] Good for you.
I don't owe him squat.

1035
00:51:33,025 --> 00:51:35,567
[RIN] No matter who wins
today, no hard feelings.

1036
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:38,608
Deal? Just make sure
you make it to Regionals.

1037
00:51:38,692 --> 00:51:40,608
[HARUKA]
Like I need you to remind me.

1038
00:51:40,692 --> 00:51:42,858
[laughs] I let you walk away

1039
00:51:42,942 --> 00:51:44,900
with the freestyle
race yesterday.

1040
00:51:44,983 --> 00:51:47,067
But today'll be
a different story.

1041
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,775
[REFEREE 7A]
Ready!

1042
00:51:55,442 --> 00:51:56,692
[RIN]
We pulled it off!

1043
00:51:56,775 --> 00:51:58,025
[SOSUKE]
Nice one.

1044
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,858
[NITORI] You got offers
from multiple scouts?

1045
00:52:06,942 --> 00:52:11,025
Rin, that's incredible!
Congrats, this is a big deal!

1046
00:52:11,108 --> 00:52:12,358
[RIN]
Thanks.

1047
00:52:12,442 --> 00:52:14,108
Of course, after
watching that race,

1048
00:52:14,192 --> 00:52:15,567
what else did we expect?

1049
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:18,692
You were absolutely amazing!

1050
00:52:18,775 --> 00:52:20,400
[RIN]
If I got a bunch of offers,

1051
00:52:20,483 --> 00:52:22,275
that means Haru did, too.

1052
00:52:22,358 --> 00:52:25,650
I can't get comfortable.
Gotta stay on top!

1053
00:52:25,733 --> 00:52:27,025
Oh, I meant to tell you.

1054
00:52:27,108 --> 00:52:29,108
I got an offer from the
school you decided on, too.

1055
00:52:29,192 --> 00:52:30,567
[gasps]

1056
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:32,900
[RIN] Of course,
it's not official yet,

1057
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,775
but we might be able
to swim on the same team

1058
00:52:34,858 --> 00:52:37,233
after graduation.

1059
00:52:37,317 --> 00:52:39,400
Cool. That'd be great.

1060
00:52:42,067 --> 00:52:43,733
[RIN]
Did I say somethin'?

1061
00:52:43,817 --> 00:52:45,775
Look, don't worry about it.

1062
00:52:45,858 --> 00:52:46,942
Yeah, right.

1063
00:52:47,025 --> 00:52:49,400
You've been acting
weird since yesterday.

1064
00:52:49,483 --> 00:52:51,817
You lost momentum
during the race, too.

1065
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,692
You in some kind of slump?

1066
00:52:55,733 --> 00:52:58,942
[RIN sighs]
Sosuke.

1067
00:52:59,025 --> 00:53:00,900
Why don't we talk outside?

1068
00:53:02,692 --> 00:53:05,192
[SOSUKE] I told you not
to worry about it, okay?

1069
00:53:05,275 --> 00:53:08,067
[sighs] Just tell me.

1070
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:10,733
How was it for you
swimming in the relay race?

1071
00:53:10,817 --> 00:53:12,358
You said it yourself.

1072
00:53:12,442 --> 00:53:13,525
[SOSUKE]
I need to figure this out.

1073
00:53:13,608 --> 00:53:16,233
Maybe relay is how.

1074
00:53:16,317 --> 00:53:17,942
Sometimes you don't know
what you're looking for

1075
00:53:18,025 --> 00:53:19,150
till you've got it.

1076
00:53:19,233 --> 00:53:22,233
'Times you just swim
too far ahead. Come on.

1077
00:53:22,317 --> 00:53:24,608
Did you figure out what
you're looking for or not?

1078
00:53:24,692 --> 00:53:26,275
I don't know.

1079
00:53:27,567 --> 00:53:28,900
Come on!

1080
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:32,025
[SOSUKE]
You heard me.

1081
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:33,942
Will you just back off already?

1082
00:53:38,733 --> 00:53:40,233
What did I say to you?

1083
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:42,442
Not everybody gets to be
a part of this, remember?

1084
00:53:42,525 --> 00:53:44,525
Only the guys who want it
more than anything else

1085
00:53:44,608 --> 00:53:46,192
have the right to be
on the relay team!

1086
00:53:46,275 --> 00:53:49,733
"Back off already?" You got
nothin' better than that?

1087
00:53:49,817 --> 00:53:51,317
So what? That's it?

1088
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,858
Was this a joke to you?

1089
00:53:54,942 --> 00:53:56,567
[SOSUKE]
Swimming with you isn't a joke.

1090
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:59,108
That's not what I'm saying!

1091
00:53:59,192 --> 00:54:00,775
Then what's wrong? Talk to me!

1092
00:54:00,858 --> 00:54:02,775
[SOSUKE]
It's not what you think.

1093
00:54:02,858 --> 00:54:06,317
It's 'cause it's not a joke
that I can't fake it!

1094
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,983
[RIN gasps]

1095
00:54:10,442 --> 00:54:11,942

important thing in his life.

You and me are like rivals.

01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,025
We shouldn't be
on the same team.

At least, that's how
I used to see it.

[SOSUKE] When you told me you
were transferring to Iwatobi,

1349
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:57,942
I didn't say a word.
Why would I?

1350
01:05:58,025 --> 01:06:00,233
And when I started
middle school,

1351
01:06:00,317 --> 01:06:02,192
all I did was focus on swimming.

You were off chasing
your dreams in Australia.

So I figured I would work
toward my own dream.

1354
01:06:09,067 --> 01:06:12,608
After a while, your
letters stopped coming.

1355

I kept rooting for you, though.

1356
01:06:14,733 --> 01:06:18,192
I knew you'd break through
that wall one way or another.

1357
01:06:18,275 --> 01:06:19,358
Once I got into high school,

1358
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:22,525
I got even more obsessed
with my training.

1359
01:06:22,608 --> 01:06:25,775
My dream was gonna happen
no matter what the cost.

1360
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,067
[SOSUKE] I used to imagine
what it'd be like

1361
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:32,525
when I'd finally made it
to a big International meet.

1362
01:06:32,608 --> 01:06:36,817
Every time I pictured it,
you were right there beside me.

1363
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,483
Those were crazy times.

1364
01:06:38,567 --> 01:06:41,192
I trained hard,
all day, every day.

1365
01:06:41,275 --> 01:06:43,442
No one could touch me.

1366
01:06:43,525 --> 01:06:45,150
I was the best.

1367
01:06:46,733 --> 01:06:48,358
[SOSUKE]
And that's when it happened.

1368
01:06:48,442 --> 01:06:50,525
My shoulder starting
giving me issues.

1369
01:06:50,608 --> 01:06:52,400
Nothing I couldn't
handle, at first.

1370
01:06:52,483 --> 01:06:55,358
So I ignored it
and kept on going.

1371
01:06:55,442 --> 01:06:57,067
Eventually, it got worse.

1372
01:06:57,150 --> 01:07:00,775
Every day it hurt a little more.

1373
01:07:00,858 --> 01:07:05,150
But no matter how bad it got,
I refused to give up.

1374
01:07:05,233 --> 01:07:07,650
I had to get stronger.

1375
01:07:07,733 --> 01:07:09,608
It's like my dream
was out there,

1376
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:13,733
calling from a
distance, mocking me.

1377
01:07:13,817 --> 01:07:16,525
I stayed at it,
but before long,

1378
01:07:16,608 --> 01:07:18,608
my shoulder finally gave out.

1379
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:22,025
[SOSUKE] It was the summer
of my freshman year.

1380
01:07:24,108 --> 01:07:26,150
You wanna know why I lied?

1381
01:07:27,733 --> 01:07:29,692
[SOSUKE] 'Cause when Gou
told me you were back,

1382
01:07:29,775 --> 01:07:32,067
I didn't want you
to see me that way.

1383
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:33,817
I didn't want you
to know the truth.

1384
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:35,817
I just couldn't handle it,
for you of all people

1385
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:37,733
to see me all broken down.

1386
01:07:37,817 --> 01:07:40,608
Rehab. Injury. Rehab.

1387
01:07:40,692 --> 01:07:43,650
That was my routine.
Day in, day out.

1388
01:07:46,233 --> 01:07:49,650
[SOSUKE] A busted rotator cuff
makes it hard to come in first.

1389
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:52,192
I got sick of being a loser.

1390
01:07:52,275 --> 01:07:55,567
Truth is, I was miserable.

1391
01:07:55,650 --> 01:07:58,817
And then, one day,
I accepted reality.

1392
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:03,067
No matter what I did,
my dream wasn't gonna happen.

1393
01:08:07,275 --> 01:08:09,692
So I turned my back
on swimming for good.

1395

You quit swimming?

1396
01:08:14,108 --> 01:08:16,150
But I wanted to see you
compete one last time

1397
01:08:16,233 --> 01:08:18,192
before I decided to retire.

1398
01:08:18,275 --> 01:08:20,942
So I dropped in on
last year's Regionals.

1399
01:08:21,025 --> 01:08:23,525
Wait, you actually
saw that race?

1400

Yeah.

1401

01:08:30,025 --> 01:08:32,692
Thing is, when I
saw you struggling

1404
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:37,608
the way you were... What can
I say? It broke my heart.

1405
01:08:37,692 --> 01:08:39,025
I thought you were
the type of guy

1406
01:08:39,108 --> 01:08:42,692
who could overcome any obstacle,
burst through any wall.

1407
01:08:42,775 --> 01:08:44,483
But something was wrong.

1408
01:08:44,567 --> 01:08:47,067
Something must've happened.

1409
01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:48,275
I give up!

1410
01:08:48,358 --> 01:08:50,983
I quit years ago and
I shoulda stayed quit!

1411
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,400
[SOSUKE]
I wanted to call out to you.

1412
01:08:57,442 --> 01:08:59,192
[SOSUKE]
But the words wouldn't come.

1413
01:09:00,567 --> 01:09:04,525
[SOSUKE] And then, in the
relay you swam with Haruka...

1414
01:09:07,983 --> 01:09:10,567
[SOSUKE] You went at it
with such intensity--

1415
01:09:10,650 --> 01:09:12,858
it's like you were
a changed man.

1416
01:09:12,942 --> 01:09:15,192
Seeing you with
the guys afterwards,

1417
01:09:15,275 --> 01:09:17,942
the way you were laughing
and carrying on.

1418
01:09:18,025 --> 01:09:19,400
I dunno.

1419
01:09:19,483 --> 01:09:22,108
It gave me a little twinge
of hope, I suppose.

1420
01:09:22,192 --> 01:09:24,942
The old dream came back to life.

1421
01:09:26,817 --> 01:09:30,567
[SOSUKE] You and me were
gonna swim side by side.

1422
01:09:30,650 --> 01:09:32,817
Honestly,

1423
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:36,067
I didn't know what
it meant to you.

1424
01:09:36,150 --> 01:09:38,942
How important it was
to swim as part of a team.

1425
01:09:40,108 --> 01:09:45,775
[SOSUKE] I realize It's over
for me. But, before I go,

1426
01:09:45,858 --> 01:09:48,442
I wanna swim the
best damn relay I can!

1427
01:09:48,525 --> 01:09:51,233
With you. Today.

1428
01:09:54,108 --> 01:09:56,608
[RIN] Idiot! Why didn't
you tell me sooner?

1429
01:09:56,692 --> 01:10:00,608
Why did you lie to me? Why?

1430
01:10:03,442 --> 01:10:05,942
Because if you would've known,

1431
01:10:06,025 --> 01:10:08,150
it would've broken your heart.

1432
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,817
You son of a-- You just--

1433
01:10:24,192 --> 01:10:26,942
[SOSUKE] Come on.
The race is about to start.

1434
01:10:27,025 --> 01:10:28,317
Are you nuts?

1435
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,442
You can't swim a relay
in the condition you're in!

1436
01:10:30,525 --> 01:10:31,733
[SOSUKE]
Oh, yes I can.

1437
01:10:31,817 --> 01:10:33,108
But if you push
yourself too hard,

1438
01:10:33,192 --> 01:10:34,983
you really will be done!

1439
01:10:35,067 --> 01:10:38,025
I know. That was the
idea from the start.

1440
01:10:38,108 --> 01:10:40,525
Forget it! I won't
let you hurt yourself!

1441
01:10:40,608 --> 01:10:42,567
I'm doing this whether
you want me to or not,

1442
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:44,067
that's all there is to it.

1443
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:46,233
Make your peace with that.

1444
01:10:46,317 --> 01:10:47,567
Yeah right!

1445
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:51,400
[SOSUKE]
I'll make you a promise.

1446
01:10:51,483 --> 01:10:54,775
I'll see this race
through to the end.

1447
01:10:54,858 --> 01:10:57,150
'Cause that's my dream.

1448
01:10:57,233 --> 01:10:59,025
What's left of it anyway.

1449
01:11:02,108 --> 01:11:03,400
No!

1450
01:11:03,483 --> 01:11:05,442
[NITORI]
Let him swim!

1451
01:11:05,525 --> 01:11:06,483
It's the right thing to do!

1452
01:11:06,567 --> 01:11:08,025
[MOMOTARO]
Yeah, come on.

1453
01:11:08,108 --> 01:11:10,525
[RIN]
You guys? How did you--?

1454
01:11:10,608 --> 01:11:11,900
We are a team!

1455
01:11:11,983 --> 01:11:13,108
I've wanted to swim with you

1456
01:11:13,192 --> 01:11:15,358
ever since I saw you
compete at Regionals.

1457
01:11:15,442 --> 01:11:17,358
That's how long I've
waited for this honor.

1458
01:11:17,442 --> 01:11:19,483
Please, don't take
that away from me!

1459
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:22,192
Sosuke put a lot of
time in to my training.

1460
01:11:22,275 --> 01:11:24,067
Let me show you what I've got!

1461
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:25,608
[MOMOTARO]
That's right! Come on!

1462
01:11:25,692 --> 01:11:26,983
How many people get to say

1463
01:11:27,067 --> 01:11:29,025
they were part of something
larger than themselves?

1464
01:11:29,108 --> 01:11:31,067
Isn't that what
this is all about?

1465
01:11:31,150 --> 01:11:32,900
Who cares if it's all
off the table tomorrow?

1466
01:11:32,983 --> 01:11:34,775
We can give it all
we've got today!

1467

We're your dream team!

Heck yeah we are!

[SOSUKE]
You know they're right.

1470
01:11:44,525 --> 01:11:46,358
And you're our captain.

1471
01:11:47,817 --> 01:11:49,775
[SOSUKE]
Let's do this while we can.

Ladies and gentlemen.

01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:13,358
the men's 100-meter
medley relay finals.

I think he's hurt.

Oh, no. Sosuke.

1477
01:12:23,942 --> 01:12:25,983
I'm proud I get to swim
the relay with you guys.

01:12:26,067 --> 01:12:27,358
Let's go win this thing!

1479
01:12:27,442 --> 01:12:30,108
Can't let all this attention
go to waste, can we?

1480
01:12:30,192 --> 01:12:32,608
Focus. If we swim
well, we do well.

1481
01:12:32,692 --> 01:12:34,775
Exactly, we'll show
everyone just how strong

be proud of yourselves.

1557
01:17:06,067 --> 01:17:07,650
Now let's get ready
for nationals!

1558
01:17:07,733 --> 01:17:09,108
[SAMEZUKA CLUB]
Yes, sir!

1559
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:12,817
It's pretty exciting stuff.

1560
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:14,067
[SUGIMOTO]
Matsuoka.

1561
01:17:16,192 --> 01:17:18,400
After your incredible showing
at the Regional Tournament,

1562
01:17:18,483 --> 01:17:21,192
every scout in the country
is paying attention.

1563
01:17:21,275 --> 01:17:24,817
You can have your "pick of the
litter," as the saying goes.

1564
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:26,525
You should narrow down
your top choices

1565
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:28,192
as soon as possible.

1566
01:17:28,275 --> 01:17:29,483
[RIN]
Right.

1567
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:36,983
[gasps]

1568
01:17:38,275 --> 01:17:40,692
Hey. Pretty good practice.

1569
01:17:40,775 --> 01:17:42,067
Thank you.

1570
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:43,442
Oh, that's right.

1571
01:17:43,525 --> 01:17:45,567
I almost forgot--you got
something in the mail today.

1572
01:17:50,108 --> 01:17:51,067
[gasps]

1573
01:17:51,150 --> 01:17:53,275
[SOSUKE]
Is it good news?

1574
01:17:53,358 --> 01:17:54,775
[RIN]
Hey, Sosuke.

1575
01:17:54,858 --> 01:17:56,150
[SOSUKE]
Yeah?

1576
01:17:56,233 --> 01:17:58,692
Do you know what you're
gonna do after you graduate?

1577
01:17:58,775 --> 01:17:59,983
I dunno.

1578
01:18:00,067 --> 01:18:01,942
Maybe move back in with
my parents for a while.

1579
01:18:02,025 --> 01:18:04,108
Help my dad run his business.

1580
01:18:04,192 --> 01:18:06,775
So, you're really
gonna quit swimming.

1581
01:18:06,858 --> 01:18:08,400
It's all over.

1582
01:18:08,483 --> 01:18:09,692
[SOSUKE]
Yep.

1583
01:18:09,775 --> 01:18:10,692
[RIN sighs]

1584
01:18:10,775 --> 01:18:13,275
[SOSUKE]
Hey, stop with the moping.

1585
01:18:13,358 --> 01:18:16,192
I told ya, my dream's
already come true.

1586
01:18:22,525 --> 01:18:24,108
Here it goes.

1587
01:18:26,233 --> 01:18:28,192
[SOSUKE]
Hey. Nanase.

1588
01:18:31,692 --> 01:18:34,233
Can I talk to you for a second?

1589
01:18:34,317 --> 01:18:35,733
[HARUKA]
What do you want?

1590
01:18:35,817 --> 01:18:37,275
Tell me.

1591
01:18:37,358 --> 01:18:39,525
Why did you stand up in the
middle of the freestyle race?

1592
01:18:39,608 --> 01:18:42,067
Whatever I did has
nothing to do with you.

1593
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:44,483
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure
it has something to do with Rin.

1594
01:18:44,567 --> 01:18:46,317
Which means it's
my business now.

1595
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,983
If you don't keep going,
then Rin might follow suit.

1596
01:18:49,067 --> 01:18:50,067
You know, it's not
the first time

1597
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:52,567
you've said something
like that to me.

1598
01:18:52,650 --> 01:18:53,775
[SOSUKE]
Even if you don't realize it,

1599
01:18:53,858 --> 01:18:55,233
you're important to Rin.

1600
01:18:55,317 --> 01:18:57,817
Which is exactly why I'm here.

1601
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,942
Because you and Rin
are connected.

1602
01:19:00,025 --> 01:19:01,775
Would you just get
to the point already?

1603
01:19:01,858 --> 01:19:03,900
Rin needs you, Haruka.

1604
01:19:03,983 --> 01:19:07,025
When he competes with
you, he's at his best.

1605
01:19:07,108 --> 01:19:08,942
You help him reach
his full potential.

1606
01:19:09,025 --> 01:19:10,067
I don't get you.

1607
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:13,192
Why the hell are you
so hung up on Rin?

1608
01:19:13,275 --> 01:19:14,942
My career is over.

1609
01:19:15,025 --> 01:19:17,775
But he could still compete
on the world level.

1610
01:19:17,858 --> 01:19:20,275
I wanna see him do what I can't.

1611
01:19:20,358 --> 01:19:22,442
[HARUKA gasps]

1612
01:19:22,525 --> 01:19:25,025
[SOSUKE] Most people would kill
to have the ability you have.

1613
01:19:25,108 --> 01:19:26,483
And it sucks to
watch you sit there

1614
01:19:26,567 --> 01:19:27,942
and do nothing with it.

1615
01:19:28,025 --> 01:19:30,192
You have talent! Use it!

1616
01:19:30,275 --> 01:19:32,192
[HARUKA gasps]

1617
01:19:32,275 --> 01:19:34,983
[SOSUKE] That's all
I wanted to say. Later.

1618
01:19:41,692 --> 01:19:43,233
All right, so is
everybody here now?

1619
01:19:43,317 --> 01:19:45,442
[SAMEZUKA CLUB]
Yes, sir!

1620
01:19:45,525 --> 01:19:47,150
[RIN]
Starting the day after tomorrow,

1621
01:19:47,233 --> 01:19:49,233
we'll have a one
week club break.

1622
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:52,817
The next time we meet will be
at the National Tournament.

1623
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:54,442
Those of you who are
competing will get there

1624
01:19:54,525 --> 01:19:57,900
two days early to practice
and make any final adjustments.

1625
01:19:57,983 --> 01:20:00,483
Until then, let's make sure
we all get plenty of rest.

1626
01:20:00,567 --> 01:20:02,192
So do you guys think
you can handle that?

1627
01:20:02,275 --> 01:20:03,942
[SAMEZUKA CLUB]
Sir, yes, sir!

1628
01:20:10,233 --> 01:20:13,233
Hey, Rin, let's go.
No time to stare into space.

1629
01:20:13,317 --> 01:20:15,025
Yeah. I know.

1630
01:20:15,108 --> 01:20:16,567
You guys, wait!

1631
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:18,067
You're totally about to walk
to the train station together

1632
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:19,192
and go home, am I right?

1633
01:20:19,275 --> 01:20:20,983
Your houses must
be really close!

1634
01:20:21,067 --> 01:20:21,983
Yikes.

1635
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:23,317
What do you want?

1636
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:26,067
Well, it's Pyunsuke,
my pet beetle.

1637
01:20:26,150 --> 01:20:28,400
Tell her to take care of him.

1638
01:20:28,483 --> 01:20:29,775
[RIN, SOSUKE]
Oh, boy.

1639
01:20:29,858 --> 01:20:31,275
[MOMOTARO]
Hey!

1640
01:20:31,358 --> 01:20:33,358
How about I release him back
into the mountains instead?

1641
01:20:33,442 --> 01:20:35,942
[yelps] Don't even joke
about my sweet little

1642
01:20:36,025 --> 01:20:37,358
Pyunsuke like that, you jerk!

1643
01:20:37,442 --> 01:20:39,983
I've raised him
since he was a larva!

1644
01:20:40,067 --> 01:20:42,025
I harvested sap,
gave him protein jelly,

1645
01:20:42,108 --> 01:20:43,358
monitored the
temperature in his cage...

1646
01:20:43,442 --> 01:20:45,233
Makoto?

1647
01:20:45,317 --> 01:20:46,483
Yeah, what's up?

1648
01:20:46,567 --> 01:20:48,483
[MAKOTO]
Hey, Rin. I, um...

1649
01:20:48,567 --> 01:20:52,150
Sorry, there's something I
wanted to talk to you about.

1650
01:20:52,233 --> 01:20:55,650
[RIN] You sound kinda down.
Did something happen?

1651
01:20:55,733 --> 01:20:57,858
[MAKOTO]
Yeah, kind of.

1652
01:21:00,692 --> 01:21:03,483
[RIN]
Wow, that explains a lot.

1653
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:05,817
Guy doesn't even sound like him.

1654
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:07,317
[MAKOTO]
I know.

1655
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:08,775
I have a feeling
Haru needs to see

1656
01:21:08,858 --> 01:21:11,483
more of the world,
like you have.

1657
01:21:11,567 --> 01:21:13,400
Strange as it seems,
I think you're the only one

1658
01:21:13,483 --> 01:21:15,817
who can to get through
to him right now.

1659
01:21:17,108 --> 01:21:19,108
[MAKOTO] We all really
love Haru, you know?

1660
01:21:19,192 --> 01:21:21,358
We want him to find
his own dream,

1661
01:21:21,442 --> 01:21:23,317
no matter what it may take.

1662
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,650
Yeah, I'm not as into
his dreams as you are.

1663
01:21:25,733 --> 01:21:28,275
[MAKOTO laughs]
That's fair.

1664
01:21:29,567 --> 01:21:31,525
I suppose I can
figure somethin' out.

1665
01:21:31,608 --> 01:21:32,233
Don't worry.

1666
01:21:32,317 --> 01:21:33,567
[MAKOTO]
Thanks.

1667
01:21:33,650 --> 01:21:37,025
I still owe him for what
he did last year, anyway.

1668
01:21:37,108 --> 01:21:39,358
You got any plans
after graduation?

1669
01:21:40,692 --> 01:21:41,983
Actually, I do.

1670
01:21:42,067 --> 01:21:44,650
I've decided I'm gonna
go to college in Tokyo.

1671
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:45,983
[RIN]
Really?

1672
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:48,192
Finally found somethin'
you wanted, huh? I'm glad.

1673
01:21:48,275 --> 01:21:50,233
Yeah, thank you. I am, too.

1674
01:21:50,317 --> 01:21:52,567
[RIN] I was kinda worried you'd
be so concerned with Haru

1675
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:54,233
that you wouldn't be able
to make any choices

1676
01:21:54,317 --> 01:21:55,983
about what you wanted
to do for yourself.

1677
01:21:56,067 --> 01:21:58,775
[MAKOTO laughs]
No, I figured it out.

1678
01:22:00,067 --> 01:22:01,900
[RIN]
It is a little sad, though.

1679
01:22:01,983 --> 01:22:03,317
[MAKOTO]
Yeah, it is.

1680
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,108
[RIN]
Hey, Makoto?

1681
01:22:05,192 --> 01:22:06,233
[MAKOTO]
Hm?

1682
01:22:06,317 --> 01:22:08,817
One day, it sure
would be nice if we--

1683
01:22:10,483 --> 01:22:11,608
Catch ya later!

1684
01:22:11,692 --> 01:22:13,942
Bye! Don't forget to
bring me something!

1685
01:22:15,483 --> 01:22:17,233
Are you seriously going?

1686
01:22:17,317 --> 01:22:19,650
[RIN] Huh? Yeah, it's been
a while since I moved

1687
01:22:19,733 --> 01:22:23,150
back from Australia.
This isn't just for Haru.

1688
01:22:23,233 --> 01:22:25,275
Couldn't hurt to remind
myself how I felt

1689
01:22:25,358 --> 01:22:28,692
when I was there, either.
Ultimately, though,

1690
01:22:28,775 --> 01:22:31,483
I want Haru to really
look at his future.

1691
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:34,025
Funny.

1692
01:22:34,108 --> 01:22:35,192
Wish you could see the
expression you make

1693
01:22:35,275 --> 01:22:36,858
when you talk about him.

1694
01:22:36,942 --> 01:22:37,942
[RIN]
Sorry, what?

1695
01:22:38,025 --> 01:22:39,067
Nothing.

1696
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:41,858
[RIN sighs]
I guess that's it.

1697
01:22:41,942 --> 01:22:44,733
So, tell me, what do you
want me to bring back for ya?

1698
01:22:46,650 --> 01:22:47,942
Nothing too sweet.

1699
01:22:48,025 --> 01:22:49,567
Way to be specific.

1700
01:22:49,650 --> 01:22:51,650
I'm sure whatever
you pick up is fine.

1701
01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:54,067
Just don't let it take up
too much luggage space.

1702
01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:57,233
[RIN] If you say so.
Not too sweet, huh?

1703
01:22:58,608 --> 01:23:01,858
Make sure you're gettin'
the rest you need. Okay?

1704
01:23:01,942 --> 01:23:04,817
Yeah, I will. Take care
of yourself down there.

1705
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:05,900
[RIN]
Yeah.

1706
01:23:06,983 --> 01:23:08,442
[NITORI]
All right, Momo!

1707
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:10,650
I think we should use this break
to polish up our exchanges

1708
01:23:10,733 --> 01:23:12,400
and make 'em super fast!

1709
01:23:12,483 --> 01:23:14,275
Heck yeah, that's an
awesome plan!

1710
01:23:14,358 --> 01:23:16,192
If we practice hard,
there's no way we won't

1711
01:23:16,275 --> 01:23:18,275
have the best exchanges ever!

1712
01:23:18,358 --> 01:23:20,275
[SOSUKE]
Hey, you two.

1713
01:23:20,358 --> 01:23:22,733
We've got this break before
the tournament for a reason.

1714
01:23:22,817 --> 01:23:25,567
You gotta be careful not
to wear yourselves out.

1715
01:23:25,650 --> 01:23:27,650
I get that, but it's
our first Nationals,

1716
01:23:27,733 --> 01:23:29,192
and the last thing
we wanna do is compete

1717
01:23:29,275 --> 01:23:31,108
while we still don't feel
100 percent confident

1718
01:23:31,192 --> 01:23:32,775
about our exchanges.

1719
01:23:32,858 --> 01:23:34,775
[MOMOTARO] I'd like to finish
in the best position I can

1720
01:23:34,858 --> 01:23:36,983
to pass it off to Rin!

1721
01:23:37,067 --> 01:23:38,942
[sighs]

1722
01:23:39,025 --> 01:23:40,525
Then, make sure you
don't slow down right

1723
01:23:40,608 --> 01:23:41,942
before your finish.

1724
01:23:42,025 --> 01:23:44,317
Bend your knees to get ready,
and focus on that goal.

1725
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,025
Don't take your eyes off it.

1726
01:23:46,108 --> 01:23:47,858
Hold on, I need to
write down some notes!

1727
01:23:47,942 --> 01:23:49,317
Crap, where'd my pen go?

1728
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,317
Thank you so much!

1729
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,025
At the joint practice
after the break,

1730
01:23:53,108 --> 01:23:55,025
I'll help you guys out myself.

1731
01:23:55,108 --> 01:23:58,525
Until then, please make sure
you keep stretching.

1732
01:23:59,650 --> 01:24:01,775
[NITORI, MOMOTARO]
We really appreciate it!

1733
01:24:06,858 --> 01:24:08,317
[SAMEZUKA CLUB]
Good morning!

1734
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,567
[RIN]
Hey.

1735
01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:11,442
Hope you had a good trip
there and back, Captain!

1736
01:24:11,525 --> 01:24:12,775
It was awesome.

1737
01:24:12,858 --> 01:24:14,942
Been any earth-shattering
changes since I left?

1738
01:24:15,025 --> 01:24:16,192
No, sir--I mean, Rin!
We've been stay--!

1739
01:24:16,275 --> 01:24:17,108
[MOMOTARO]
What'd you get me?

1740
01:24:17,192 --> 01:24:18,358
Can I have my souvenir now?

1741
01:24:18,442 --> 01:24:20,692
Subtle. Nice.

1742
01:24:20,775 --> 01:24:23,233
Why not? Sure.
Knock yourself out.

1743
01:24:23,317 --> 01:24:25,317
Awesome! It's a boomerang!

1744
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:33,608
[gasps]

1745
01:24:33,692 --> 01:24:35,317
[SOSUKE] Give yourself
more time to recover.

1746
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:36,942
Your center of balance is off.

1747
01:24:37,025 --> 01:24:38,983
[MOMOTARO]
Sosuke!

1748
01:24:39,067 --> 01:24:40,733
Oh, hey.

1749
01:24:40,817 --> 01:24:41,608
Sorry I'm late.

1750
01:24:41,692 --> 01:24:43,567
Got here as soon as I could.

1751
01:24:43,650 --> 01:24:45,567
So Australia. Good?

1752
01:24:45,650 --> 01:24:47,983
Oh, yeah, it's incredible.

1753
01:24:49,358 --> 01:24:52,317
[SOSUKE] Man. Kind of a long
way to go to make a point.

1754
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,150
Yeah, well. It's worth it.

1755
01:24:55,233 --> 01:24:57,567
And I'd do it all again
in a heartbeat.

1756
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:03,442
[NAGISA laughs]

1757
01:25:07,775 --> 01:25:09,108
[SOSUKE]
Bet you would.

1758
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:13,692
[sighs]

1759
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:14,900
[RIN]
What's the matter, ladies?

1760
01:25:14,983 --> 01:25:17,817
No one got the guts
to take on the captain?

1761
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:19,150
Momo!

1762
01:25:19,233 --> 01:25:22,025
[MOMOTARO] Give me a second
to not die, will ya?

1763
01:25:22,108 --> 01:25:24,567
[RIN] Today, we third
years say good-bye.

1764
01:25:24,650 --> 01:25:26,067
Lot of change on the horizon.

1765
01:25:26,150 --> 01:25:27,900
Come April, there'll
be new recruits.

1766
01:25:27,983 --> 01:25:29,567
Club as you know
it'll be overhauled.

1767
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:31,108
My hope for each
and every one of you

1768
01:25:31,192 --> 01:25:33,442
is that you'll make the cut,
be part of the Regionals team.

1769
01:25:33,525 --> 01:25:36,650
The year after that, same thing:
new recruits, new team.

1770
01:25:36,733 --> 01:25:38,983
I want you to feel like
you're carrying the torch,

1771
01:25:39,067 --> 01:25:41,483
keeping the dream alive
from season to season.

1772
01:25:41,567 --> 01:25:43,108
You all need to know
that you're part of

1773
01:25:43,192 --> 01:25:45,192
something bigger
than yourselves!

1774
01:25:45,275 --> 01:25:46,483
[SAMEZUKA CLUB]
Yes, sir!

1775
01:25:46,567 --> 01:25:48,983
Heh. Nice. Surprised
you're not bawling.

Ai!

01:25:50,442 --> 01:25:52,108
Uh, sir!

1778
01:25:52,192 --> 01:25:54,775
Next year, you call the shots.

1779
01:25:55,942 --> 01:25:58,067
[RIN]
I'm making you captain.

1780

Sir.

01:25:59,233 --> 01:26:00,317
[MOMOTARO]
Go, Nitori!

1782
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,233
[UOZUMI]
Congratulations, Captain!

1783
01:26:12,942 --> 01:26:14,358
[SOSUKE]
Rin?

1784
01:26:14,442 --> 01:26:15,358
[RIN]
Where you gettin' this idea

1785
01:26:15,442 --> 01:26:16,983
that your shoulder
can't be fixed?

1786
01:26:17,067 --> 01:26:17,983
[SOSUKE]
What?

1787
01:26:18,067 --> 01:26:19,858
Are you seriously
out of the game?

1788
01:26:19,942 --> 01:26:21,858
Or are you closing the
door on your dreams

1789
01:26:21,942 --> 01:26:23,692
before you even try?

1790
01:26:23,775 --> 01:26:26,233
Give it some thought.

1791
01:26:26,317 --> 01:26:29,692
When you decide not to
be done, I'll be waiting.

1792
01:26:33,233 --> 01:26:36,525
[SOSUKE]
Wow. 'Course you'd say that.

1793
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:38,317
What else did I expect?

1794
01:26:40,442 --> 01:26:44,692
Well, it hasn't
fallen on deaf ears.

1795

Don't fight it.

All right.

1802
01:28:05,942 --> 01:28:07,275
[GOU]
Take a break, Rin.

1803
01:28:07,358 --> 01:28:09,317
You don't have to
practice all the time.

1804
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,983
Maybe try coming home
every once in a while.

1805
01:28:12,067 --> 01:28:14,400
You know how worried
Mom gets about you.

1806

[RIN laughs]
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1807

And you never make sense.

please check all the equipment.

And Momo, I'd like you
to please take care

01:28:50,567 --> 01:28:52,317

[MOMOTARO, UOZUMI, IWASHIMIZU]
Yes, sir!

1825
01:28:55,692 --> 01:28:57,817
[MAKOTO] I realize how hard
you worked this year.

1826
01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:00,942
So, from now on, I'd like the
three of you to work together

1827
01:29:01,025 --> 01:29:04,650
on the Iwatobi Swim Club.
That sound doable?

stubborn we were?

No, I'm thinkin'
I'll go back home

for a couple of weeks
before leaving.

1843
01:32:04,233 --> 01:32:05,358
Mom misses me a lot,

1844

and that's not easy
for Gou, you know?

1845
01:32:07,192 --> 01:32:09,275
I'll be taking off after that.

Gotcha. I'll be
writing you again.

Oh, you will? Well, I'll
make sure to reply this time.

1848
01:32:15,358 --> 01:32:17,483
Really? You'll write back?

Yeah.

[SOSUKE]
Hey, Rin.

1851
01:32:23,983 --> 01:32:26,483
Actually, there's something
that's been bothering me

1852
01:32:26,567 --> 01:32:27,775
for a little while.

1853
01:32:30,067 --> 01:32:34,108
[SOSUKE] During Nationals,
this one swimmer caught my eye.

1854
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:37,442
Yeah, I noticed that
Kinjo from Suda-East

1855
01:32:37,525 --> 01:32:39,900
has gotten a lot better
in the 100 and the 200

1856
01:32:39,983 --> 01:32:41,608
in just the past six months.

1857
01:32:41,692 --> 01:32:42,608
[SOSUKE]
No.

1858
01:32:42,692 --> 01:32:43,317
Uh...

1859
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,275
It's Ikuya Kirishima.

1860
01:32:46,317 --> 01:32:47,650
Hold on, who?

1861
01:32:47,733 --> 01:32:51,150
[SOSUKE] This guy. I
completely forgot about him.

1862
01:32:51,233 --> 01:32:53,942
He was a breaststroke swimmer
during middle school.

1863
01:32:54,025 --> 01:32:56,067
Had a pretty decent
time back then.

1864
01:32:56,150 --> 01:32:57,150
But he didn't really appear

1865
01:32:57,233 --> 01:33:00,858
in any official races
in high school.

1866
01:33:00,942 --> 01:33:03,483
When I saw him swim at
the tournament, though...

1867
01:33:15,358 --> 01:33:17,067
The individual medley.

1868
01:33:17,150 --> 01:33:18,858
[SOSUKE]
Yeah. His strokes were perfect.

1869
01:33:18,942 --> 01:33:20,650
I couldn't find even
a single flaw.

1870
01:33:20,733 --> 01:33:22,108
And if that was all,
he would have just

1871
01:33:22,192 --> 01:33:24,900
been an amazing swimmer.
No big deal.

1872
01:33:24,983 --> 01:33:28,067
I wouldn't have been
so hung up on it.

1873
01:33:28,150 --> 01:33:30,233
What surprised me
about him was...

1874
01:33:41,608 --> 01:33:43,900
[SOSUKE]
He swam like someone else.

1875
01:33:43,983 --> 01:33:45,567
Haruka Nanase.

1876
01:33:48,858 --> 01:33:51,067
[SOSUKE] I can't shake this
feeling I have about him.

1877
01:33:51,150 --> 01:33:54,942
I think he actually wants
to swim freestyle.

1878
01:33:55,025 --> 01:33:57,817
Rin, if you're aiming
for the world after this,

1879
01:33:57,900 --> 01:34:00,900
you're not gonna be able to
avoid swimming against him.

1880
01:34:02,983 --> 01:34:05,817
[RIN]
Ikuya Kirishima.

1881
01:34:08,650 --> 01:34:10,317
[HIYORI] I mean, it was
our last tournament.

1882
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:13,733
You could've at least attended
the awards ceremony, Ikuya.

1883
01:34:13,817 --> 01:34:15,442
Plus, you had some old
friends that were there,

1884
01:34:15,525 --> 01:34:17,317
and you missed out
on seeing 'em.

1885
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:19,317
Hey, what was the middle
school you went to again?

1886
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:21,358
Iwatobi, wasn't it?

1887
01:34:21,442 --> 01:34:22,567
Where are you goin'?

1888
01:34:22,650 --> 01:34:24,525
Just gonna call my brother.

1889
01:34:26,317 --> 01:34:28,983
Always with the big brother.

1890
01:34:29,067 --> 01:34:30,650
Will you stop saying that?

1891
01:34:33,608 --> 01:34:36,567
I swear, he's so adorable.

1892
01:34:37,608 --> 01:34:40,275
Finally third years.
It's about time, huh?

1893
01:34:40,358 --> 01:34:41,900
We're so gonna own this year!

1894
01:34:41,983 --> 01:34:44,525
I know, but first we need
to get some club members!

1895
01:34:44,608 --> 01:34:46,358
This time, we're gonna show
all the new students

1896
01:34:46,442 --> 01:34:49,733
at this school something amazing
that they've never seen before!

1897
01:34:49,817 --> 01:34:51,317
[HANAMURA] What on earth
could that even be?

1898
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:54,483
Hey, don't laugh.
I'm serious! Gah!

1899
01:34:55,567 --> 01:34:56,608
[NAGISA, NITORI]
Ah--

1900
01:34:56,692 --> 01:34:58,942
Hey, Iwatobians,
long time no see!

1901
01:34:59,025 --> 01:35:00,733
Yeah, not since the
tournament, right?

1902
01:35:00,817 --> 01:35:02,150
Oh, yeah. Congrats, Ai.

1903
01:35:02,233 --> 01:35:04,233
We heard you were made
the new team captain!

1904
01:35:04,317 --> 01:35:05,692
[NITORI]
Thanks!

1905
01:35:05,775 --> 01:35:07,608
And congrats to Ryugazaki
for being your new captain!

1906
01:35:07,692 --> 01:35:10,108
Thank you! Looking forward
to the coming year!

1907
01:35:10,192 --> 01:35:11,525
Well, you wanna
keep up the tradition

1908
01:35:11,608 --> 01:35:14,442
of a healthy rivalry between
Samezuka and Iwatobi?

1909
01:35:14,525 --> 01:35:15,233
[REI]
Yeah!

1910
01:35:15,317 --> 01:35:16,483
I mean, how could we not?

1911
01:35:16,567 --> 01:35:17,858
So here's a friendly warning,

1912
01:35:17,942 --> 01:35:20,525
prepare yourselves for
the next joint practice!

1913
01:35:20,608 --> 01:35:22,150
Oh, you don't have
to worry about us.

1914
01:35:22,233 --> 01:35:23,775
We'll be more than ready
to show your team

1915
01:35:23,858 --> 01:35:25,650
how it's supposed to be done!

1916
01:35:26,775 --> 01:35:28,525
[MISAKA]
Sir, thanks to you,

1917
01:35:28,608 --> 01:35:30,317
we were able to
make it to Regionals.

1918
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:31,900
It was the most amazing thing
I've ever experienced!

1919
01:35:31,983 --> 01:35:33,775
[ARATO]
Thank you so much, sir!

1920
01:35:33,858 --> 01:35:35,233
Now, don't cry, you guys.

1921
01:35:35,317 --> 01:35:36,608
Remember, we still
gotta get ready

1922
01:35:36,692 --> 01:35:37,983
for the coming school year!

1923
01:35:38,067 --> 01:35:39,192
You need to focus.

1924
01:35:39,275 --> 01:35:40,483
Believe in yourselves first,

1925
01:35:40,567 --> 01:35:42,692
and I know you'll
get amazing results!

1926
01:35:42,775 --> 01:35:43,733
[MISAKA, TAKAMARU, ARATO]
Yes, sir!

1927
01:35:43,817 --> 01:35:44,525
[phone vibrates]

1928
01:35:44,608 --> 01:35:46,442
Huh? One sec.

1929
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:50,858
It's my sister telling
me not to forget

1930
01:35:50,942 --> 01:35:53,942
that we're going back to my
grandma's to visit next week.

1931
01:35:54,025 --> 01:35:54,650
[phone vibrates]

1932
01:35:54,733 --> 01:35:56,067
Huh?

1933
01:35:57,525 --> 01:35:58,858
No way!

1934
01:35:58,942 --> 01:36:00,150
It looks like I'll get to see
one of my old friends

1935
01:36:00,233 --> 01:36:01,483
while I'm there!

1936
01:36:01,567 --> 01:36:02,733
[TAKAMARU]
Cool.

1937
01:36:02,817 --> 01:36:05,192
And where exactly does
your grandma live again?

1938
01:36:05,275 --> 01:36:07,525
Um, how do you not remember?

1939
01:36:07,608 --> 01:36:10,483
She lives in Iwatobi.

1940
01:36:10,567 --> 01:36:12,817
[KISUMI]
Oh, nice! Asahi!

1941
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:15,150
That name sure takes me back.

1942
01:36:15,233 --> 01:36:17,400
I wonder if he's doing okay.

1943
01:36:17,483 --> 01:36:20,358
It'd be nice to get
everyone together again.

1944
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:30,692
[MAKOTO]
Wow. There are so many people.

1945
01:36:30,775 --> 01:36:32,733
Unimaginable back at home, huh?

1946
01:36:32,817 --> 01:36:34,067
[HARUKA]
Yeah.

1947
01:36:34,150 --> 01:36:36,067
Hey, is something
bothering you?

1948
01:36:36,150 --> 01:36:37,525
I can't relax.

1949
01:36:37,608 --> 01:36:39,858
[MAKOTO laughs]
Yeah, me neither.

1950
01:36:39,942 --> 01:36:42,442
I just feel really anxious.

1951
01:36:42,525 --> 01:36:44,483
But...

1952
01:36:44,567 --> 01:36:46,525
I'm pretty excited, too.

1953
01:36:52,608 --> 01:36:55,983
Same here. Should be fun.

1954
01:36:56,067 --> 01:36:58,025
[REFEREE 13B]
Take your marks.

1955
01:36:58,108 --> 01:37:01,317
Makoto. You're ready, yeah?

1956
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:02,692
[MAKOTO]
Mm-hm.

1957
01:37:05,733 --> 01:37:08,650
[HARUKA] By the time
you're 20, you're normal.

1958
01:37:08,733 --> 01:37:10,233
I wonder.

1959
01:37:10,317 --> 01:37:14,192
When I look back on these days,
will I be happy with who I am?

1960
01:37:25,483 --> 01:37:27,358
[HARUKA]
For now, I just want to treasure

1961
01:37:27,442 --> 01:37:29,442
each moment as it comes.

1962
01:37:31,483 --> 01:37:33,233
--[beep]
--[CROWD] Go!

1963
01:37:53,525 --> 01:37:56,150
[MAKOTO] Let's see.
The preview for next time is...

1964
01:37:56,233 --> 01:37:57,692
[HARUKA]
This is Haruka, <i>moge</i> .

1965
01:37:57,775 --> 01:37:59,567
I've been captured by an evil
organization and transformed

1966
01:37:59,650 --> 01:38:01,233
into the monster,
Iwamogera, <i>moge</i> .

1967
01:38:01,317 --> 01:38:02,567
[RIN]
Not at all accurate.

1968
01:38:02,650 --> 01:38:04,775
[REI] In March, when the
third years all graduate,

1969
01:38:04,858 --> 01:38:06,983
these four beautiful
stories will bring color

1970
01:38:07,067 --> 01:38:08,317
to an early spring.

1971
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,192
[NAGISA] Rei and I will
be transformed, too!

1972
01:38:10,275 --> 01:38:13,150
[HARUKA] The biceps brachii
muscle versus the soleus muscle.

1973
01:38:13,233 --> 01:38:15,108
A duel at Iwatobi coast, <i>moge</i> !

1974
01:38:15,192 --> 01:38:17,192
And then, the true identity
of the mysterious

1975
01:38:17,275 --> 01:38:19,483
trapezius muscle man
who appears there is...

1976
01:38:19,567 --> 01:38:21,483
[RIN]
That's not right! Next time:

1977
01:38:21,567 --> 01:38:22,817
[MAKOTO]
"Choice of Fate!"

1978
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:24,400
[NAGISA] "Cooling Down at
a Secluded Hot Springs!"

1979
01:38:24,483 --> 01:38:25,817
[REI]
"Butterfly of Promise!"

1980
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:27,567
[HARUKA]
"Eternal Blue of Setting Off!"

1981
01:38:27,650 --> 01:38:29,567
[RIN] We're bringing you
these four stories.

1982
01:38:29,650 --> 01:38:32,358
[HARUKA, MAKOTO, NAGISA, REI,
RIN] In <i>Free! Take Your Marks</i> !

1983
01:38:32,442 --> 01:38:36,442
[RIN] Ah, no, no guys, I got
this. <i>Take Your Marks</i> .
