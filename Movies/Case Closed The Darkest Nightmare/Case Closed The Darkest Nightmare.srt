1
00:01:01,253 --> 00:01:02,435
Alright, that's enough.

2
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:04,778
Hands up and back away.

3
00:01:07,153 --> 00:01:10,045
Hmph, and I don't want any funny business, got it?

4
00:01:10,135 --> 00:01:10,431
Hmph.

5
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:36,898
You okay, Mr. Furuya?

6
00:01:37,103 --> 00:01:37,859
I'm fine.

7
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,462
Wait a minute... Those eyes!

8
00:01:42,487 --> 00:01:43,585
Out of the way, sir!

9
00:01:43,726 --> 00:01:44,532
Hold it!

10
00:01:44,676 --> 00:01:45,165
Hmph.

11
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:47,526
Freeze!

12
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:58,650
Stop right there!

13
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:04,522
Freeze!

14
00:02:04,998 --> 00:02:06,258
Watch it..! Huh?!

15
00:02:06,307 --> 00:02:06,721
Ough!

16
00:02:08,654 --> 00:02:09,502
Woah!

17
00:02:28,394 --> 00:02:29,794
Huh? Woah!

18
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:35,610
Hey! Wait!

19
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:37,463
Uh... Woah!

20
00:02:55,731 --> 00:02:56,551
Argh..!

21
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,168
Ugh!

22
00:03:10,008 --> 00:03:10,813
Ugh...

23
00:03:14,747 --> 00:03:15,300
Huh...

24
00:03:26,968 --> 00:03:27,726
Who's that?!

25
00:03:29,564 --> 00:03:30,288
Akai?!

26
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:44,070
Just fall back Akai! She's Public Safety's now!

27
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:56,878
Urgh!

28
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,335
Heh.

29
00:04:20,481 --> 00:04:21,139
Hmph.

30
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,357
What the?!

31
00:04:44,232 --> 00:04:44,697
Argh!

32
00:04:57,037 --> 00:04:59,000
Ugh! Not so fast!

33
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:03,235
Hmph.

34
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:09,709
Ugh!

35
00:05:18,948 --> 00:05:19,315
Hmph.

36
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:24,734
If she escapes, the whole world is gonna panic.

37
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,507
Damn it!

38
00:05:32,077 --> 00:05:33,656
She's driving the wrong way!

39
00:05:58,462 --> 00:05:59,056
Rye!

40
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,632
Hmph... No problem, I'll just run you over!

41
00:06:13,055 --> 00:06:13,654
Hmph.

42
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:21,576
Hmm...

43
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:29,936
Ugh!

44
00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:40,185
Huh?

45
00:06:46,171 --> 00:06:46,572
Hup!

46
00:07:02,993 --> 00:07:03,726
Ugh!

47
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:22,287
Huh?

48
00:07:25,975 --> 00:07:26,990
Akai you...

49
00:07:27,754 --> 00:07:28,461
You..!

50
00:07:33,123 --> 00:07:33,601
Ugh...

51
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:48,147
It's me.

52
00:07:48,985 --> 00:07:51,673
She got away. I'll leave the rest to you.

53
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:52,644
Right.

54
00:08:18,895 --> 00:08:20,586
Huh... Ah...

55
00:08:55,715 --> 00:08:58,867
I'm Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.

56
00:08:59,194 --> 00:09:02,179
I went to an amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran.

57
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,747
And while we were there, we witnessed
some men in black making a dangerous deal.

58
00:09:08,705 --> 00:09:10,792
Because I was so absorbed in watching them,

59
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,704
I didn't notice the man who came at me from behind.

60
00:09:16,481 --> 00:09:20,554
He forced me to drink a poison that
knocked me out, and when I woke up...

61
00:09:24,576 --> 00:09:26,839
...I discovered that my body had shrunk!

62
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:33,294
If those guys ever found out
that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,

63
00:09:33,452 --> 00:09:37,401
they'd come back, which would put
everyone I know in terrible danger.

64
00:09:37,684 --> 00:09:41,683
So on Dr. Agasa's advice, I
kept my real identity a secret.

65
00:09:41,946 --> 00:09:46,119
When Ran asked me who I was, I quickly
made up the name, "Conan Edogawa."

66
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:48,785
I knew if I wanted info on the men in black,

67
00:09:48,911 --> 00:09:51,986
the smart thing would be to stay
at her house with her and her dad,

68
00:09:52,054 --> 00:09:53,696
who ran a detective agency.

69
00:09:53,871 --> 00:09:59,113
In addition to that, there are a few others
besides the Doc who know my true identity.

70
00:10:00,157 --> 00:10:03,734
This is Ai Haibara, her real name is Shiho Miyano.

71
00:10:04,044 --> 00:10:06,607
She used to be a member of the Black Organization,

72
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,200
but she wanted out so she tried to kill herself,

73
00:10:09,356 --> 00:10:13,585
taking the exact same poison was
given, and it shrank her body too.

74
00:10:22,241 --> 00:10:24,795
The Black Organization is shrouded in mystery.

75
00:10:25,215 --> 00:10:30,036
In fact, all we know is that their code
names are taken from various types of liquor.

76
00:10:30,348 --> 00:10:35,977
Undercover agents have infiltrated the Organization,
in an attempt to find out their true identities.

77
00:10:36,972 --> 00:10:39,412
Kir, aka Rena Mizunashi.

78
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:41,553
A spy trained by the CIA.

79
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,073
And Bourbon, aka Toru Amuro.

80
00:10:45,151 --> 00:10:48,763
From the Security Planning
Division's Undercover Subdivision, ZERO.

81
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:53,334
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is
going after the Black Organization as well.

82
00:10:53,476 --> 00:10:58,377
Their team consists of James Black,
Andre Camel, and Jodie Starling.

83
00:10:59,105 --> 00:11:01,217
And then, there's Shuichi Akai.

84
00:11:02,121 --> 00:11:04,410
He's one of the FBI's best agents,

85
00:11:04,445 --> 00:11:06,459
and an incredibly skilled marksman.

86
00:11:06,761 --> 00:11:09,636
But there's a long history between him and Amuro.

87
00:11:09,861 --> 00:11:12,932
My body may have shrunk but my IQ hasn't.

88
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:15,692
Detective Conan leaves no case unsolved.

89
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,930
There is always only one truth!

90
00:11:29,996 --> 00:11:31,718
Aaaah... huh? Uh...

91
00:11:31,826 --> 00:11:32,390
Hm?

92
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:36,412
We've got a problem Doc. We don't have anymore snacks!...

93
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:38,250
You already ate everything?!

94
00:11:38,275 --> 00:11:40,060
That was for everyone Genta!

95
00:11:40,228 --> 00:11:41,963
Hahah... sorry about that.

96
00:11:42,144 --> 00:11:42,869
What's up?

97
00:11:43,393 --> 00:11:45,123
You're really focused on something.

98
00:11:45,614 --> 00:11:49,564
Well there hasn't been an announcement
on what caused that massive black out yet.

99
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:51,542
So, I'm trying to find out more.

100
00:11:51,604 --> 00:11:55,872
Look! They're doing a special
on the aquarium we're going to!

101
00:11:55,905 --> 00:11:57,929
Huh? Let me see your phone, Conan!

102
00:11:58,422 --> 00:11:59,256
Yeah sure, here.

103
00:11:59,281 --> 00:12:00,039
Me too!

104
00:12:00,158 --> 00:12:03,219
Give it! Ugh, this stupid belt in the way!

105
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:05,588
Uh, leave your seat belt on while I'm driving!

106
00:12:06,002 --> 00:12:08,258
Man, what a bummer.

107
00:12:08,345 --> 00:12:11,578
Hey what's the big deal? We're almost there, right Genta?

108
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:14,568
Hey, I think it's about to start!

109
00:12:14,593 --> 00:12:17,438
... to provide us with an exclusive virtual tour.

110
00:12:17,463 --> 00:12:19,852
So, why don't we take a look at the changes they've made?

111
00:12:20,612 --> 00:12:24,370
The renovations focused on 3
key elements you can see here.

112
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:31,408
First, each of the amusement facilities and shops
have been relocated indoors for easier guest access.

113
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:36,134
Now everyone can enjoy themselves
without having to worry about the weather.

114
00:12:41,346 --> 00:12:45,890
Next, there's the attraction that's
proven to be the aquarium's most popular...

115
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:48,347
That's right, the dolphin show!

116
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:53,313
It's always been a staple, but this
one is unlike any you've seen before!

117
00:12:53,586 --> 00:12:56,970
The dolphins have been working
hard practicing their new routines,

118
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,832
and they're guaranteed to surprise and amaze you!

119
00:13:00,138 --> 00:13:00,954
Bye bye!

120
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,430
Wow, you're lucky!

121
00:13:02,524 --> 00:13:04,433
Then there's the biggest renovation.

122
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,990
They'll be revealing the world's
first, two-wheeled Ferris wheel!

123
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:10,152
It's sure to be a crowd pleaser!

124
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:14,485
The North and South wheels
face opposite sides of the park.

125
00:13:14,655 --> 00:13:19,392
So you'll have an entirely different view of
the landscape depending on which wheel you ride!

126
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:24,230
You'll have front row seats for a special
light and water display from the fountains below,

127
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:29,540
along with an unbelievable view from 100
meters above ground! You won't want to miss it!

128
00:13:29,613 --> 00:13:32,110
So come down and enjoy the fun!

129
00:13:32,138 --> 00:13:33,949
Let's go ride on the Ferris wheel!

130
00:13:33,974 --> 00:13:34,947
Sounds great!

131
00:13:35,037 --> 00:13:37,620
Wait, I thought we were going to the aquarium today...

132
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,824
Well we can see both of them can't we?

133
00:13:40,822 --> 00:13:42,841
That's a great idea! Let's do both!

134
00:13:42,866 --> 00:13:43,422
Hey, Doc?

135
00:13:43,446 --> 00:13:43,763
Huh?

136
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,918
Thanks for paying for all of our tickets.

137
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,063
Erk... Ugh...

138
00:13:47,652 --> 00:13:50,160
Wow! Look how big it is!

139
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,104
Yeah!

140
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:52,280
It's huge!

141
00:13:52,325 --> 00:13:54,335
We'll be there in five minutes!

142
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:03,745
Ah...

143
00:14:15,869 --> 00:14:16,496
Hmm...

144
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,786
Alright! We made it!

145
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:27,965
Come on!

146
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,054
Here we go!

147
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:30,630
Wait for us, Genta!

148
00:14:31,035 --> 00:14:32,305
Doc, hurry up!

149
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:36,172
Ai! Conan! Move it guys, pick up the pace!

150
00:14:36,682 --> 00:14:40,371
So, which one are you going to?
The aquarium or the Ferris wheel?

151
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:40,936
Which one?!

152
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:42,679
Hey! What're you talking about, Doc?

153
00:14:42,704 --> 00:14:44,633
Yeah! We wanna go to both of them!

154
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:46,837
Heheh! Then let's make a deal.

155
00:14:46,972 --> 00:14:50,594
I'll give you a quiz and if you get
the right answer, then you can do both!

156
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:52,847
Now, here we go!

157
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,290
What color paint is always a different color,

158
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,682
even if it's not mixed with any other color?

159
00:14:57,788 --> 00:15:00,128
I'll give you 4 options to choose from!

160
00:15:00,865 --> 00:15:03,530
One, red. Two, blue.

161
00:15:03,605 --> 00:15:06,410
Three, brown. Four, black.

162
00:15:06,714 --> 00:15:07,113
Uuh...

163
00:15:07,204 --> 00:15:08,490
Without mixing it?

164
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,939
That sounds pretty impossible to me.

165
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:13,665
Gaaah! I've got no idea!

166
00:15:14,005 --> 00:15:14,923
Doc.

167
00:15:15,285 --> 00:15:16,856
Now stop being childish.

168
00:15:16,912 --> 00:15:18,523
Try the names in Japanese.

169
00:15:18,547 --> 00:15:19,045
Erk!

170
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,810
It might help you find the answer.

171
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:23,826
Hold on Conan, you're not allowed to play!

172
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:27,285
For example, the color red's "makka."

173
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,786
"Massao" is blue.

174
00:15:28,842 --> 00:15:30,249
That's more than a hint, Ai!

175
00:15:30,274 --> 00:15:31,156
I got it!

176
00:15:31,394 --> 00:15:31,848
Hm?!

177
00:15:31,873 --> 00:15:34,103
The word for brown is "maccha," right?

178
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,794
Yeah! A different color!

179
00:15:35,862 --> 00:15:38,100
Yup! - What are you talking about?

180
00:15:38,735 --> 00:15:41,502
Red is "makka," blue is "massao,"

181
00:15:41,627 --> 00:15:44,454
brown is "maccha," and black is "makkuro".

182
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,312
Try focusing on the brown and you'll figure it out!

183
00:15:47,502 --> 00:15:50,087
Yeah! What else does the word "maccha" mean?

184
00:15:50,145 --> 00:15:52,816
Oh right! "Matcha" is green tea!

185
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,451
Hey come on! You guys can't just give out clues like that!

186
00:15:55,476 --> 00:15:57,810
Okay! Let's go buy tickets!

187
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,140
Yay!

188
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:00,416
Wait a minute!

189
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:01,753
Let's do the Ferris wheel first!

190
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:04,903
No fair! You wouldn't have figured it out on your own!

191
00:16:05,912 --> 00:16:06,649
Huh?

192
00:16:10,244 --> 00:16:12,641
We're gonna be so high up in the air!

193
00:16:12,676 --> 00:16:14,410
Wonder if we can see our house?

194
00:16:14,829 --> 00:16:18,103
What's wrong Conan? Wait a second! Hey!

195
00:16:19,293 --> 00:16:21,633
Sorry to bother you, but are you okay?

196
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:23,138
Huh?

197
00:16:24,295 --> 00:16:25,686
Your face is dirt?

198
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:26,391
Huh...

199
00:16:26,677 --> 00:16:27,629
Wow!

200
00:16:28,173 --> 00:16:31,198
Your right eye and left eye
are completely different colors!

201
00:16:31,255 --> 00:16:33,572
She might not understand what you're saying to her.

202
00:16:33,621 --> 00:16:35,491
No, no. I understand.

203
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,601
What happened? Are you alone?

204
00:16:38,287 --> 00:16:41,408
It's a strange place to be by yourself. Besides...

205
00:16:41,498 --> 00:16:44,330
Looks like you're injured... On your knees and hands...

206
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,337
And your phone's broken too.

207
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:48,863
Do you mind if I take a look?

208
00:16:48,897 --> 00:16:49,989
Uh, alright?

209
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:52,386
How long have you been sitting out here, Miss?

210
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:53,440
Uh...

211
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,555
Okay... Where'd you come from?

212
00:16:57,256 --> 00:16:58,369
I don't know.

213
00:17:00,857 --> 00:17:02,325
Do you remember your name?

214
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:03,651
My name is...

215
00:17:04,913 --> 00:17:07,133
I'm sorry but, I'm not sure.

216
00:17:07,801 --> 00:17:09,310
Can I have a look at your head?

217
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:10,421
I guess so?

218
00:17:12,405 --> 00:17:15,506
It's not much of a wound, but it seems pretty fresh.

219
00:17:15,585 --> 00:17:18,005
She must have been in a car wreck and hurt her head.

220
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:22,208
So then... Traumatic retrograde amnesia?

221
00:17:22,628 --> 00:17:25,705
Wait, how do you know that she was in a car accident?

222
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:30,252
Her cellphone... The impact was hard enough to break it.

223
00:17:31,157 --> 00:17:34,225
And this, looks like a shattered piece of the windshield.

224
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:37,121
So she hit her head while driving?

225
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:40,338
In older cars, glass can shatter like this.

226
00:17:40,474 --> 00:17:43,279
Newer models have layers of film to avoid that.

227
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:44,923
But this one didn't.

228
00:17:46,008 --> 00:17:49,834
Not to mention the odor. There's no mistaking gasoline.

229
00:17:51,048 --> 00:17:52,409
Oh, I smell it too.

230
00:17:52,675 --> 00:17:55,350
Excuse me, do you have anything else on you?

231
00:17:55,502 --> 00:17:56,835
Huh? Uh...

232
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,287
Hmm... Uh...

233
00:18:01,987 --> 00:18:03,080
What is this?

234
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:03,935
Could I see it?

235
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,216
Uh... Yeah.

236
00:18:05,383 --> 00:18:06,741
You know what it is?

237
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:09,750
I'm not sure. But they kind of look like flash cards?

238
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,918
They're transparent colored
filters... But for what purpose?

239
00:18:13,986 --> 00:18:14,599
Hey!

240
00:18:14,623 --> 00:18:15,370
Huh?

241
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,530
Ai! Conan!

242
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,179
We bought your tickets so you can come with us!

243
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,824
This just got a lot more complicated.

244
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,059
Hey wait, who's that lady?

245
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:29,604
Huh? Wow, your eyes are two different colors! Cute!

246
00:18:29,629 --> 00:18:32,532
Ah! So have you got a fake eye or something?

247
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:36,297
It's not fake Genta. I think
that's what they call an "odd eye."

248
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,533
An odd eye? - Huh?

249
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,020
That's a real unusual name isn't it?

250
00:18:41,129 --> 00:18:43,295
You got it all wrong, that isn't her name.

251
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,728
I know! You mean eye's like a seal, right?

252
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,236
A seal..?

253
00:18:48,072 --> 00:18:50,462
You were talking about her eyes, weren't you?

254
00:18:50,688 --> 00:18:51,879
Uh... Yeah.

255
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,430
Oh... I'm so sorry.

256
00:18:54,713 --> 00:18:56,626
Hey look, we got her laughing!

257
00:18:56,651 --> 00:18:57,772
Yeah. We did!

258
00:18:57,942 --> 00:19:01,428
By the way, why haven't all of you gone into the park yet?

259
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:02,809
Perfect timing, Doc.

260
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:07,443
This woman got into an accident, and it
seems like she's suffering from amnesia.

261
00:19:07,941 --> 00:19:11,105
Wait, what Shin-? Urk, I mean! What, Conan?!

262
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:14,084
Yeah, maybe it's related to what happened last night?

263
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:16,205
We should report this to the police.

264
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,509
You can't!

265
00:19:17,534 --> 00:19:18,178
Huh?

266
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,227
Why not? You don't want the police involved?

267
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,260
I... I don't know.

268
00:19:24,611 --> 00:19:27,318
But if they showed up, they might be able to help you out?

269
00:19:28,056 --> 00:19:29,462
Huh? Aah!

270
00:19:29,553 --> 00:19:31,730
It's rude to take pictures without permission!

271
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,508
Hold on a second! We won't call the police.

272
00:19:34,826 --> 00:19:35,495
Huh?

273
00:19:36,527 --> 00:19:40,232
I only needed to get your picture
so I can find somebody who knows you.

274
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:41,752
... Who knows me?

275
00:19:41,865 --> 00:19:45,222
Sure, we're gonna do all that
we can to get your memory back.

276
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,537
Are you serious?!

277
00:19:46,648 --> 00:19:48,230
We wanna help too!

278
00:19:48,948 --> 00:19:50,847
Don't fear, cause we're he!

279
00:19:50,872 --> 00:19:53,897
Together, we're the Youth Detective Squad!

280
00:19:55,844 --> 00:20:00,310
We're gonna do everything we can to find
your friends and help you get your memory back!

281
00:20:00,335 --> 00:20:02,297
Yeah! You can count on us!

282
00:20:02,445 --> 00:20:04,837
Ah... Thanks so much.

283
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,168
The first thing we should do
is find someone who knows her!

284
00:20:08,265 --> 00:20:10,752
Mhm! - But I thought you were going to the Ferris wheel?

285
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:12,533
What're you talking about, Doc?!

286
00:20:12,613 --> 00:20:14,866
This is way more important than that!

287
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,773
But I already bought all those tickets for you...

288
00:20:17,887 --> 00:20:19,248
Out of the way, Doc!

289
00:20:19,272 --> 00:20:19,710
Huh?

290
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:23,551
What are you waiting for? Let's go! Yeah!

291
00:20:23,576 --> 00:20:25,243
Now come on! Let's get to work!

292
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,430
Wait up you kids! This isn't a game you know!

293
00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:32,335
So you're really not going to
report all this to the police?

294
00:20:32,428 --> 00:20:33,979
Of course I'm reporting it.

295
00:20:36,717 --> 00:20:40,922
Last night a car that was driving
along the Shuto Expressway route 11,

296
00:20:40,947 --> 00:20:44,625
exploded into flames in the
warehouse district below the overpass...

297
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:46,886
Hey, Dad! Uh...

298
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:50,027
Ooh.. Hey, Yoko...

299
00:20:56,933 --> 00:20:58,408
Wake up! Dad!

300
00:20:58,432 --> 00:20:58,918
Woah!

301
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,923
You slacker! Just how much sleep do you need?!

302
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:07,227
Argh! You don't know what you're talking about!
Detectives need sleep to keep our brains sharp!

303
00:21:07,282 --> 00:21:10,036
So in other words, you're hungover
and now you've got a headache.

304
00:21:10,232 --> 00:21:13,902
Woah!! That's ridiculous! I said no such thing..!

305
00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:14,909
Woah!

306
00:21:15,147 --> 00:21:16,712
You've got a message from Conan.

307
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:17,415
Huh?

308
00:21:17,472 --> 00:21:20,601
He's with somebody who has
amnesia and wants you to report it.

309
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:22,880
I told Officer Takagi about it.

310
00:21:23,388 --> 00:21:25,210
Try to help him too, okay?

311
00:21:25,516 --> 00:21:26,885
Beautiful!

312
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:28,449
Are you listening?

313
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:31,300
Where in the world is this beautiful creature?!

314
00:21:31,447 --> 00:21:33,556
She's over at the Touto Aquarium.

315
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,588
Alright!

316
00:21:34,691 --> 00:21:35,087
Yaah!

317
00:21:35,112 --> 00:21:36,198
Hey hold on a second!

318
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,446
Fear not! The great detective's on the job!

319
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,363
I wasn't finished talking to...!

320
00:21:41,607 --> 00:21:42,973
Ugh... Oh, Dad.

321
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:49,483
Inspector, take a look at this.
It's the photo that Ran sent us.

322
00:21:50,095 --> 00:21:54,484
Sir, at the time the police were originally
called, they were told it might have been an accident.

323
00:21:54,903 --> 00:21:56,457
Oh, is that so..?

324
00:21:56,944 --> 00:21:58,668
Well there was a big one this morning.

325
00:21:59,246 --> 00:22:01,397
And nobody knows where the driver is.

326
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:07,520
As big as it was, we should all know more about
it... But the cops and the media are both in the dark.

327
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:08,837
Think this is..?

328
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,585
We're gonna need to take a look into this, Inspector.

329
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:13,308
Sir!

330
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,726
Huh? What is it?

331
00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:19,770
Section 3 doesn't have any more
information than we do on this, Inspector.

332
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:21,025
I see...

333
00:22:21,233 --> 00:22:22,185
What's this about?

334
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:27,081
There's a rumor that somebody infiltrated
the Public Security Bureau last night.

335
00:22:27,489 --> 00:22:28,747
Wait, seriously?

336
00:22:28,826 --> 00:22:32,929
But the strangest part is that MPD
still hasn't heard anything about all this.

337
00:22:33,348 --> 00:22:34,437
What's going on here?

338
00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:40,591
I've got a hunch that there is some
incredibly powerful forces at work.

339
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,034
Bingo.

340
00:23:03,408 --> 00:23:06,565
Hmph... I just found her, Gin.

341
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:07,733
Where?

342
00:23:07,863 --> 00:23:09,095
Touto Aquarium.

343
00:23:09,272 --> 00:23:09,993
Really?

344
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,485
Just rest easy, and I'll have her back soon.

345
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:20,990
The staff of the Touto City Aquarium
would like to thank you for visiting us today.

346
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,446
Are we there yet, Daddy?

347
00:23:22,504 --> 00:23:24,567
...attraction, the dolphin show,

348
00:23:24,795 --> 00:23:26,110
will begin shortly.

349
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,663
I'm beginning to think that
she hasn't been here before today.

350
00:23:29,856 --> 00:23:33,334
Me too. No one we've talked to remembers seeing her...

351
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:37,219
And with hair and eyes like
that, you'd think someone would.

352
00:23:37,588 --> 00:23:40,505
Hmm... What's the plan? Where to next?

353
00:23:41,202 --> 00:23:43,471
Well, we've already covered the ground area...

354
00:23:43,644 --> 00:23:45,148
Give it your best shot!

355
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:47,700
It's your last dart, so don't miss, okay?

356
00:23:48,204 --> 00:23:49,312
Unbelievable...

357
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,164
Oh...

358
00:23:59,229 --> 00:23:59,911
Wow!

359
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:04,354
You just achieved the highest score of
the entire day! Congratulations, Miss!

360
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:07,078
Gimme ten up top, lady!

361
00:24:07,296 --> 00:24:08,705
Put both your hands out!

362
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:09,323
Uuh...

363
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:10,485
Hehe, yeah!

364
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,417
Okay, now it's my turn!

365
00:24:12,442 --> 00:24:13,576
Mine too!

366
00:24:13,978 --> 00:24:15,324
You're awesome!

367
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:16,475
Now me!

368
00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:18,631
Hey, you're laughing again!

369
00:24:19,504 --> 00:24:22,688
You're real pretty, but you're
even prettier when you're smiling!

370
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,383
Yeah!

371
00:24:23,482 --> 00:24:24,476
She sure is!

372
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:25,317
You think so?

373
00:24:25,476 --> 00:24:26,651
Definitely!

374
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,805
 Here! Your prize is any 3 of these keychains.

375
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,680
Yay!

376
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:33,890
You mean we get to pick them out?

377
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:34,687
I want this one!

378
00:24:34,712 --> 00:24:35,462
Found mine!

379
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,724
I'll take that one there! - Hm.

380
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,323
Okay, here you go!

381
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,618
Doesn't she get one?

382
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,255
Oh, I don't need it.

383
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:42,406
Thanks though.

384
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,866
But you gotta...

385
00:24:44,001 --> 00:24:46,292
You did all the work so you should get a prize.

386
00:24:46,324 --> 00:24:47,427
Hey guys.

387
00:24:47,967 --> 00:24:49,508
Conan, Ai!

388
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:52,498
I thought you were gonna try
and help her get her memory back,

389
00:24:52,523 --> 00:24:54,817
but it looks like you're just playing carnival games.

390
00:24:54,889 --> 00:24:55,746
Yeah, but...

391
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,489
Uh, we were gonna get to that right after darts!

392
00:24:58,642 --> 00:25:02,302
Then, she won these for us! Bet you wish you had one, huh?

393
00:25:02,357 --> 00:25:04,003
You haven't even started..?

394
00:25:04,584 --> 00:25:07,906
Maybe you and I should handle
that part of the investigation also.

395
00:25:07,938 --> 00:25:08,677
Hey!

396
00:25:09,478 --> 00:25:12,768
Hey, look up here! Do you see me?!

397
00:25:13,141 --> 00:25:14,985
Hey kids, over here! Hey, Doc!

398
00:25:15,762 --> 00:25:18,139
What're you doing all the way up there?

399
00:25:18,274 --> 00:25:20,800
The line for the Ferris wheel's died down!

400
00:25:21,022 --> 00:25:23,105
This is your chance to get on!

401
00:25:23,393 --> 00:25:24,354
Seriously!?

402
00:25:24,448 --> 00:25:27,028
So Ferris wheel first, and then we investigate!

403
00:25:27,053 --> 00:25:29,691
Great idea! And maybe the ride will help her!

404
00:25:29,935 --> 00:25:30,983
So let's find out!

405
00:25:31,018 --> 00:25:31,828
Yeah!

406
00:25:33,788 --> 00:25:34,624
Come with us!

407
00:25:34,719 --> 00:25:36,170
We're gonna ride the Ferris wheel!

408
00:25:36,194 --> 00:25:36,859
Huh, sure?

409
00:25:37,009 --> 00:25:37,842
Typical...

410
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:41,434
Doc loves Ferris wheels too, so
why not let him have a little fun.

411
00:25:43,601 --> 00:25:46,789
I'm pretty sure he's more excited
about the ride than the kids are.

412
00:25:47,749 --> 00:25:48,646
Exactly!

413
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:53,326
Mister? Have you ever seen that woman
who was just playing darts here earlier?

414
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,766
Huh? Oh, are you talking about
the one with the white hair?

415
00:25:56,791 --> 00:25:58,167
That's right! Do you know her?

416
00:25:58,945 --> 00:26:01,257
I'm not sure. She didn't look familiar.

417
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:05,482
And I'd remember somebody who played
as well as she did! Pretty amazing!

418
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,697
All bull's eyes.

419
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,890
That takes a lot more than just luck.

420
00:26:10,715 --> 00:26:12,345
Thanks for all your help mister!

421
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,648
Oh, hang on.

422
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:17,218
Take this, and give it to your friend for me, all right?

423
00:26:17,892 --> 00:26:19,267
Okay, but what is it?

424
00:26:19,695 --> 00:26:21,955
Just a keychain that hasn't been colored in yet.

425
00:26:22,397 --> 00:26:26,150
I didn't have this when she was here before,
but I thought it'd be something she'd like.

426
00:26:26,212 --> 00:26:29,928
Now she'll be able to paint it any color
of the rainbow that she can think of, y'know?

427
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,056
That's great! I'm sure she'll enjoy it.

428
00:26:32,194 --> 00:26:33,923
And thanks again for everything.

429
00:26:34,028 --> 00:26:36,109
Yeah, no problem! Have a great day!

430
00:26:36,665 --> 00:26:37,579
Let's go, Ai.

431
00:26:37,618 --> 00:26:40,318
Uh, okay... So where to next?

432
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:45,881
Let's talk to some more people around the construction
areas before we join up with Doc and the others.

433
00:26:46,502 --> 00:26:49,640
Those darts make me think we'd be
better off sticking closer to her,

434
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,955
than searching for clues about where she's been.

435
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,430
This is gonna be so cool!

436
00:27:11,455 --> 00:27:13,989
I wonder what we'll see when we get up there?

437
00:27:14,037 --> 00:27:15,166
I bet we can see the Bell Tree Tower!

438
00:27:15,191 --> 00:27:17,065
What're you doing out here?

439
00:27:17,325 --> 00:27:18,741
Now let's get you home.

440
00:27:19,866 --> 00:27:23,629
Hey, keep up, Miss! We don't wanna leave you behind!

441
00:27:23,653 --> 00:27:24,401
Coming!

442
00:27:25,068 --> 00:27:25,640
Huh?

443
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:27,761
I thought I heard someone talking to me.

444
00:27:28,015 --> 00:27:30,017
Really? Was it someone you knew?

445
00:27:30,168 --> 00:27:32,520
No, no. It was just a mistake.

446
00:27:33,036 --> 00:27:34,725
Alright, is this everyone?

447
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,266
Yeah!

448
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,081
Aye aye!

449
00:27:36,106 --> 00:27:37,152
Then right this way!

450
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:42,335
I think we have a problem. I'm going to have to improvise.

451
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,367
Do it fast. We can't have her walk around freely.

452
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,860
No, we can't. Ugh.

453
00:27:49,822 --> 00:27:51,293
Mommy, wait!

454
00:27:51,644 --> 00:27:54,576
Nobody out in the construction areas knew her either.

455
00:27:54,687 --> 00:27:58,333
I would ask you to go ahead and
contact Doc, but is something wrong?

456
00:27:58,395 --> 00:27:59,436
Uh, what do you mean?

457
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,771
You've been spacing out a lot.

458
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,067
Oh, have I?

459
00:28:03,092 --> 00:28:05,616
Hey! Conan, Ai!

460
00:28:06,026 --> 00:28:07,219
Over here!

461
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,390
Yeah! Look up!

462
00:28:09,449 --> 00:28:10,109
Check it out!

463
00:28:10,134 --> 00:28:11,106
We see you!

464
00:28:11,304 --> 00:28:12,484
Can you see us?

465
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:14,025
Look at how up high we are!

466
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,143
Genta, watch out!

467
00:28:15,317 --> 00:28:16,407
What are they saying?

468
00:28:16,436 --> 00:28:17,417
Genta, no!!

469
00:28:17,442 --> 00:28:19,163
Woah! Stay back!

470
00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:23,631
I've got you!

471
00:28:23,656 --> 00:28:24,076
Please, Miss!

472
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:25,306
You can't let me fall!

473
00:28:25,331 --> 00:28:26,252
Think, damn it..!

474
00:28:26,761 --> 00:28:29,160
I-I'm losing my grip! Aah!

475
00:28:29,231 --> 00:28:30,747
Hang on Genta!

476
00:28:46,749 --> 00:28:47,446
Hmph!!

477
00:28:56,274 --> 00:28:57,894
Hey! Are you all right, Genta?!

478
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,699
Now speak to me Genta! Please, say something!

479
00:29:06,642 --> 00:29:09,819
Huh... I must have blacked out for a second there.

480
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,141
But you're safe now.

481
00:29:15,112 --> 00:29:16,763
Oh, I fell!

482
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:19,425
I fell from up there and you caught me, huh?

483
00:29:20,118 --> 00:29:22,079
Are you okay?! You're not hurt are you?

484
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:25,089
No, I'm fine! All thanks to my friend here!

485
00:29:25,114 --> 00:29:26,107
Thank goodness!

486
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:29,024
Still, would you mind going
by medical, just to be certain?

487
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:35,775
The hell's going on?

488
00:29:37,183 --> 00:29:37,787
There!

489
00:29:38,071 --> 00:29:39,844
I think you're gonna be just fine, sir.

490
00:29:40,062 --> 00:29:42,028
Great. Thanks a lot, doctor.

491
00:29:42,256 --> 00:29:43,413
Here goes nothing.

492
00:29:43,468 --> 00:29:45,262
Ah. Ow, ow, ow, ow!

493
00:29:45,287 --> 00:29:48,280
Why is Doc the one getting all the medical attention?

494
00:29:48,321 --> 00:29:49,656
It's pathetic, right?

495
00:29:49,896 --> 00:29:51,555
He's such a big baby.

496
00:29:51,772 --> 00:29:54,241
You kids will understand when you get older. -

497
00:29:54,473 --> 00:29:57,817
Well, now that he's okay, let's
go back to the Ferris wheel!

498
00:29:57,935 --> 00:29:59,148
Thanks again, lady

499
00:29:59,390 --> 00:29:59,945
Let's go!

500
00:29:59,977 --> 00:30:00,861
Yeah, come on!

501
00:30:01,074 --> 00:30:03,053
Huh? Right... Okay.

502
00:30:03,973 --> 00:30:05,706
Are you sure I won't be a bother?

503
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:08,200
No way, we like having you around!

504
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,672
And not just cause you saved my life either!

505
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,758
He's right!

506
00:30:11,782 --> 00:30:13,301
It's settled then, come on.

507
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,403
No, Wait!

508
00:30:14,427 --> 00:30:15,009
Huh?

509
00:30:15,065 --> 00:30:16,725
Conan... Can we talk?

510
00:30:17,101 --> 00:30:17,966
Okay.

511
00:30:18,315 --> 00:30:20,377
Why don't the rest of us head to the Ferris wheel?

512
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,254
You can't!

513
00:30:21,547 --> 00:30:22,567
Just wait, Doc..!

514
00:30:22,627 --> 00:30:23,797
Huh? Sure...

515
00:30:24,313 --> 00:30:24,916
Aw...

516
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,520
Why do we have to wait?

517
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,046
This is so lame.

518
00:30:28,473 --> 00:30:29,030
Hm...

519
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:36,888
What's up, huh?

520
00:30:37,118 --> 00:30:41,747
Listen, Ai and Conan are talking over
there. While they're focused on each other...

521
00:30:41,772 --> 00:30:42,193
Huh?

522
00:30:42,858 --> 00:30:46,161
You really think she's one of
them? Are you sure about that?

523
00:30:47,203 --> 00:30:49,150
I can't be completely certain...

524
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:51,549
But you sensed something too, didn't you?

525
00:30:53,096 --> 00:30:57,140
Now that I think about it, her eye
looked like it could have been artificial...

526
00:30:57,881 --> 00:30:59,978
It's fake? Are you serious?

527
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,806
Very. The one you mentioned.

528
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,366
The Black Organization second in command... -

529
00:31:06,144 --> 00:31:08,749
Rum. It's her.

530
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:12,418
Hm.

531
00:31:14,074 --> 00:31:16,214
Hey, Miss! Can you hear me?

532
00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:18,033
Hm? Of course.

533
00:31:18,061 --> 00:31:18,807
Shhh!

534
00:31:19,997 --> 00:31:20,427
Hm?

535
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:30,405
If she is Rum, then this a good chance
that she hasn't lost her memory at all.

536
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,308
You mentioned before that Rum's
age and gender are unknown, right?

537
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:39,210
That's true, but I heard a lot of rumors and
theories back when I was in the Organization.

538
00:31:39,243 --> 00:31:41,061
Like he's a hulking giant,

539
00:31:41,344 --> 00:31:42,975
or that he's a womanly male.

540
00:31:43,366 --> 00:31:46,091
I've even heard that he might be a frail old man.

541
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:52,906
Also, Rum was supposedly injured in an
accident, and now has an artificial eye...

542
00:31:55,227 --> 00:31:58,683
And if that eye is a prosthetic rather than a condition...

543
00:31:58,778 --> 00:32:02,592
We can assume that her amnesia may not be real either...

544
00:32:03,678 --> 00:32:07,415
If she wanted to get closer to
us, why put on an act like that?

545
00:32:07,518 --> 00:32:09,250
Well... I don't know.

546
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:12,230
Based on what you've said, and her physical abilities

547
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:15,009
there's a good chance she's with the Black Organization.

548
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:19,419
But if she really does have amnesia, that changes things.

549
00:32:19,982 --> 00:32:23,329
No it doesn't! We can never let her regain her memories!

550
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,055
Not ever! You think if she does,
you'll get intel on the Organization!

551
00:32:28,499 --> 00:32:31,348
I hope I'm wrong about this! I hope you know better!

552
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:34,642
Because if you do that, you're putting us in danger!

553
00:32:35,015 --> 00:32:38,122
And I'm not just talking about
you and me, but the kids, too!

554
00:32:38,154 --> 00:32:38,774
Huh?

555
00:32:39,996 --> 00:32:40,809
They're gone!

556
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,975
It's just Doc?!

557
00:32:42,563 --> 00:32:44,690
Hahaha! Adorable!

558
00:32:44,772 --> 00:32:45,772
Hey, Doc!

559
00:32:45,984 --> 00:32:46,534
Huh?

560
00:32:48,275 --> 00:32:51,104
Aah! Pigeons, don't go!

561
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,049
Come on! This isn't the time, Doc!

562
00:32:53,145 --> 00:32:54,541
What happened to the kids?

563
00:32:55,194 --> 00:32:56,599
I'm not really sure.

564
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,953
Ugh! It's Conan.

565
00:32:59,175 --> 00:33:00,938
Just let it go to voicemail.

566
00:33:01,015 --> 00:33:03,185
He's gonna get mad at us either way!

567
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,195
Oh well.

568
00:33:04,806 --> 00:33:07,566
Look! We're even higher than the pigeons!

569
00:33:07,836 --> 00:33:08,845
Hey, yeah!

570
00:33:08,884 --> 00:33:10,313
Can you see them, Miss?

571
00:33:10,416 --> 00:33:11,850
There are so many of them.

572
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:14,178
the person you are trying to reach is not available..

573
00:33:14,203 --> 00:33:15,266
Damn, those guys!

574
00:33:15,318 --> 00:33:16,964
I bet they're by the Ferris wheel.

575
00:33:17,385 --> 00:33:19,190
They've been talking about it all day.

576
00:33:19,474 --> 00:33:20,578
Right. Come on!

577
00:33:20,848 --> 00:33:24,107
Hey, wait just a second! I'm coming too!

578
00:33:24,615 --> 00:33:28,365
So you probably play some kind
of sport don't you? Which one?

579
00:33:28,753 --> 00:33:29,262
What?

580
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:33,252
If you weren't an athlete, there's no
way you could have saved Genta like that!

581
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:36,580
You're awesome! You must be in
really good shape, aren't you?

582
00:33:36,652 --> 00:33:37,613
G-Good shape?

583
00:33:37,997 --> 00:33:39,678
Oh, do you think so?

584
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,411
Of course! You look like a super model!

585
00:33:42,602 --> 00:33:45,670
Oh, hey you guys! The fountain's gotten bigger!

586
00:33:45,695 --> 00:33:47,717
It's coming up really high!

587
00:33:47,742 --> 00:33:49,157
That's amazing!

588
00:33:49,713 --> 00:33:50,824
Can you see it, Miss?

589
00:33:50,883 --> 00:33:52,351
Yes, it's beautiful.

590
00:33:52,723 --> 00:33:56,719
Wow! And there's a rainbow you guys! How awesome is that!

591
00:33:56,893 --> 00:33:58,887
Come over here and check it out with us!

592
00:33:58,984 --> 00:34:00,747
I see it! Wow.

593
00:34:00,822 --> 00:34:02,262
So cool!

594
00:34:08,763 --> 00:34:10,660
Hey, are you okay?

595
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:12,138
Yeah, what's wrong?

596
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,780
I'm alright... Just feeling a little dizzy.

597
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:17,701
I'll bet you're probably scared of heights or something.

598
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:22,104
Oh! Hey, I think we're almost at the top guys!

599
00:34:22,709 --> 00:34:23,709
Oh, yeah!

600
00:34:24,621 --> 00:34:28,903
We finally made it! Look how high we are!

601
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:32,461
This is great! The people look like ants!

602
00:34:34,612 --> 00:34:35,543
Ugh..!

603
00:34:36,068 --> 00:34:39,320
Huh? What's wrong?! Are you gonna be okay?

604
00:34:39,407 --> 00:34:39,962
 Hey!

605
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:41,458
Get a hold of yourself!

606
00:34:41,569 --> 00:34:42,593
What do we do?

607
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:44,795
Just hang on! I'll try to call somebody!

608
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,295
NOC is...

609
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,192
Hey, Ayumi!

610
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:46,488
Huh?

611
00:34:46,513 --> 00:34:48,307
She isn't making any sense at all!

612
00:34:48,407 --> 00:34:49,973
We've gotta do something!

613
00:34:50,003 --> 00:34:51,858
Maybe her memory is coming back?

614
00:34:51,883 --> 00:34:52,348
NOC is...

615
00:34:52,373 --> 00:34:55,280
There's no time to panic now! Get Conan on the phone!

616
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,386
Genta! What is she talking about?

617
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:01,224
Uh, something about knocking on a door?

618
00:35:01,249 --> 00:35:02,232
Are you positive?

619
00:35:02,295 --> 00:35:04,024
Kir, Bourbon...

620
00:35:04,049 --> 00:35:06,218
Wait, she said something different this time!

621
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:08,370
Be quiet alright? I'm trying to listen!

622
00:35:08,395 --> 00:35:11,430
Stout. Aquavit. Riesling... Ugh!

623
00:35:14,105 --> 00:35:16,172
Answer... Come on!

624
00:35:17,457 --> 00:35:18,792
Ah! Hey, it's ringing!

625
00:35:20,972 --> 00:35:21,940
Is something wrong?

626
00:35:21,965 --> 00:35:23,830
It's my phone! I wonder if...

627
00:35:24,084 --> 00:35:25,077
Yeah, it's them!

628
00:35:26,206 --> 00:35:27,837
Mitsuhiko, where are you?

629
00:35:27,862 --> 00:35:29,219
You've gotta help us!

630
00:35:29,873 --> 00:35:31,269
Ayumi, What's wrong?

631
00:35:31,355 --> 00:35:35,295
We were riding the Ferris wheel and
the lady started feeling really sick!

632
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,170
What? How is she now?

633
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:39,019
Uh, well...

634
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,570
She's holding her head and moaning.

635
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,884
She's talking but I don't know what it means!

636
00:35:43,964 --> 00:35:45,119
I wrote it down!

637
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:45,654
Mm!

638
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:47,740
Mitsuhiko was taking notes!

639
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:51,797
Please hurry Conan! We need your help!

640
00:35:58,279 --> 00:36:00,620
Conan, we're here! Where's the woman you called about?

641
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,135
She's being released from the clinic any minute now!

642
00:36:03,222 --> 00:36:05,088
Alright, Takagi. We should get moving.

643
00:36:05,398 --> 00:36:05,834
Right!

644
00:36:06,121 --> 00:36:07,718
Okay, stay here!

645
00:36:07,871 --> 00:36:08,680
I gotta go!

646
00:36:08,891 --> 00:36:10,182
You guys wanna tag along?

647
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:10,817
No!

648
00:36:11,389 --> 00:36:12,810
No way. Got it?

649
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:18,856
Hmph.

650
00:36:22,935 --> 00:36:24,046
Pardon us, doctor.

651
00:36:24,419 --> 00:36:25,744
Oh, of course. Come on in.

652
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:27,773
Hope we're not interrupting.

653
00:36:28,059 --> 00:36:32,096
When we spoke on the phone earlier, I mentioned
that the police would like to take her into custody.

654
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:33,907
Sure I understand completely.

655
00:36:34,089 --> 00:36:36,668
If she'll be receiving further
medical attention, there's some

656
00:36:36,693 --> 00:36:39,363
information I'd like you to
pass along to that hospital staff.

657
00:36:39,871 --> 00:36:43,947
She almost certainly suffers from amnesia
due to a rather strong blow to the head.

658
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:47,276
But more importantly, there's this.

659
00:36:47,943 --> 00:36:50,953
We discovered some very unusual damage to her fornix.

660
00:36:51,264 --> 00:36:52,933
It's right around this area, here.

661
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:54,036
Huh?

662
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,817
So it isn't from the accident?

663
00:36:56,262 --> 00:36:59,258
No, I believe that it's far more likely to be congenital.

664
00:36:59,662 --> 00:37:01,695
Do you think that's why she collapsed?

665
00:37:01,784 --> 00:37:04,779
This part of the brain isn't
typically active in day-to-day life,

666
00:37:05,104 --> 00:37:06,685
so I don't think that's the cause.

667
00:37:07,105 --> 00:37:09,560
I'll make sure to relay that to everyone concerned.

668
00:37:10,076 --> 00:37:10,725
Thank you.

669
00:37:10,749 --> 00:37:11,790
Oh, forgive me.

670
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,239
There's just one more thing.

671
00:37:13,786 --> 00:37:18,158
As the physical was being conducted, we
also found this in her right eye. Take a look.

672
00:37:18,721 --> 00:37:20,302
Is that what I think it is?

673
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,280
Looks like colored contact lens.

674
00:37:22,423 --> 00:37:23,893
Yes, that's it exactly.

675
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:26,652
Apparently it's to make her iris appear black.

676
00:37:27,937 --> 00:37:32,729
So we were wrong... It wasn't an
odd eye, or an artificial one at all.

677
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,977
I just assumed it was something you might want to know.

678
00:37:37,585 --> 00:37:38,409
Excuse me.

679
00:37:38,783 --> 00:37:41,420
We've made preparations to transport the patient now.

680
00:37:41,738 --> 00:37:43,057
We'll just be going then.

681
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:43,995
All right.

682
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:45,965
Thank you for your help, Doctor.

683
00:37:48,189 --> 00:37:51,512
Oh uh, shouldn't you be going
with the adults as well, young man?

684
00:37:51,699 --> 00:37:55,014
Yeah! I've just got one more thing I wanna ask you.

685
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:56,239
What would that be?

686
00:37:56,382 --> 00:37:58,859
About that colored contact lens you mentioned.

687
00:37:59,129 --> 00:38:01,886
If only one of her eyes were supposed to look black,

688
00:38:02,082 --> 00:38:05,199
that means both of her eyes
were blue to begin with, right?

689
00:38:05,421 --> 00:38:07,796
The left is blue, but the right is transparent.

690
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,426
Transparent?

691
00:38:09,592 --> 00:38:13,200
Well, I suppose it would be more
accurate to say, it appeared that way.

692
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:17,643
It's incredibly rare but, the iris is
almost the same color as the surrounding sclera,

693
00:38:17,699 --> 00:38:19,501
 so it certainly gives off that impression.

694
00:38:19,703 --> 00:38:21,863
I guess that's kind of confusing, right?

695
00:38:22,363 --> 00:38:27,295
Then that means her right and left
eyes are different colors after all.

696
00:38:27,982 --> 00:38:29,014
Hey, Doctor!

697
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:32,610
That makes perfect sense!
Thank you so much for telling me!

698
00:38:32,652 --> 00:38:33,477
So, that's all?

699
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,646
Mm-hmm! I'll see ya later!

700
00:38:35,705 --> 00:38:37,310
Sure. You take care, now.

701
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,151
Over here?

702
00:38:39,145 --> 00:38:41,377
Now this room's where my client is, right?!

703
00:38:41,742 --> 00:38:45,786
Sir! Only authorized personnel are allowed in here!

704
00:38:45,888 --> 00:38:50,035
Get your hands off me! I AM authorized, damn it! Stop!

705
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:50,859
Pops Kogoro!

706
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:51,489
Huh?

707
00:38:52,128 --> 00:38:53,526
What're you doing here?

708
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:55,299
Oh, it's you! Perfect!

709
00:38:55,824 --> 00:38:58,690
Where is she? Where's my stunning vision of a client?!

710
00:38:58,797 --> 00:38:59,757
She's not here.

711
00:38:59,822 --> 00:39:00,527
Huh?

712
00:39:00,853 --> 00:39:04,007
She was just taken to the
police hospital a little while ago.

713
00:39:04,174 --> 00:39:07,040
And besides, she isn't one of your clients anyway.

714
00:39:07,267 --> 00:39:08,218
Wait, she's not?

715
00:39:08,243 --> 00:39:10,617
It sounds like you weren't paying attention to Ran.

716
00:39:11,918 --> 00:39:14,344
Now do you have any more business here, sir?

717
00:39:14,556 --> 00:39:15,915
Uh, nah that's it...

718
00:39:23,616 --> 00:39:24,979
Wonder what happened...

719
00:39:25,003 --> 00:39:25,681
Beats me.

720
00:39:26,602 --> 00:39:30,885
It turns out the reason she's been
acting strangely is because she has amnesia.

721
00:39:31,321 --> 00:39:33,681
And, where is she now exactly?

722
00:39:33,852 --> 00:39:35,754
They took her to the police hospital.

723
00:39:36,161 --> 00:39:38,829
So the cops have started moving too, is that it?

724
00:39:39,305 --> 00:39:42,277
Yes. And there's something that worries me.

725
00:39:42,365 --> 00:39:43,071
What's that?

726
00:39:43,407 --> 00:39:47,999
It seems that she had some kind of seizure
while she was riding the Ferris wheel earlier.

727
00:39:48,197 --> 00:39:48,975
That so?

728
00:39:49,316 --> 00:39:49,967
It is.

729
00:39:50,049 --> 00:39:53,527
Just keep an eye on her and
report back if there's anything else.

730
00:39:53,749 --> 00:39:54,496
Copy that.

731
00:39:55,641 --> 00:39:58,389
Seizure on the Ferris wheel. Don't tell me...

732
00:40:00,121 --> 00:40:03,657
What's going on? Why do you guys
think Ai hates the lady so much?

733
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,279
I dunno... I've never seen her that mad before.

734
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:10,301
And you have no idea why she's so angry either, Doc?

735
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,198
I don't.

736
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:16,497
I tried to ask her, but she said she wasn't
feeling very well and then went back home, so...

737
00:40:16,903 --> 00:40:19,642
See Ayumi, it's no use asking Doc.

738
00:40:19,962 --> 00:40:23,497
Remember she's pretty much always mad at him, isn't she?

739
00:40:23,981 --> 00:40:24,909
That's true!

740
00:40:24,933 --> 00:40:25,388
Oh...

741
00:40:26,238 --> 00:40:29,178
Um, oh I forgot! Conan gave me something.

742
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,864
He said it's for you, here.

743
00:40:31,633 --> 00:40:32,617
Hey, is that?

744
00:40:32,775 --> 00:40:35,795
It kinda looks like the keychains we got at the darts game.
- Huh.

745
00:40:36,398 --> 00:40:39,037
But this one's not colored in. Why not?

746
00:40:39,213 --> 00:40:42,731
Conan did mention that, but I
can't quite remember what he told me.

747
00:40:42,756 --> 00:40:43,804
Aw...

748
00:40:43,829 --> 00:40:46,122
Never mind. I'll ask him myself.

749
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:48,262
Huh? Who could this be?

750
00:40:49,008 --> 00:40:51,884
Oh, looks like this is Conan. Hold on you guys.

751
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:53,576
Yes, hello?

752
00:40:53,982 --> 00:40:56,118
Hey Doc, are you still with the kids?

753
00:40:56,604 --> 00:40:59,146
Yeah. We were just having a little tea at Poirot.

754
00:40:59,893 --> 00:41:02,180
Good, cause I need some information.

755
00:41:02,729 --> 00:41:05,311
But first I was wondering, is that woman okay?

756
00:41:05,405 --> 00:41:09,554
Huh? She's at the police
hospital, and she's gonna be alright.

757
00:41:10,264 --> 00:41:11,121
Don't worry!

758
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,350
I'm glad.

759
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:14,722
So is there anything you need me to help you out with?

760
00:41:14,746 --> 00:41:15,226
Yeah!

761
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:19,358
I wanna see if you can repair the
internal data of the cellphone she had.

762
00:41:19,675 --> 00:41:21,066
I don't mind trying it out,

763
00:41:21,113 --> 00:41:23,649
but I'm not so sure that I can fix it completely.

764
00:41:24,047 --> 00:41:27,456
Okay. And I also hear that she might
have been trying to say something,

765
00:41:27,481 --> 00:41:30,203
when she had that attack earlier on the Ferris wheel.

766
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:36,289
Oh! I didn't get it all from the very
beginning, but I wrote most of it down.

767
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:40,492
Uh, she said Stout at first, and then Aquavit,

768
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,511
and it sounded like Riesling right after that.

769
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:45,398
I wonder what they mean.

770
00:41:45,423 --> 00:41:46,426
Kinds of liquor?

771
00:41:46,594 --> 00:41:47,523
This is bad!

772
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,121
You said that you're at Poirot, didn't you?

773
00:41:50,248 --> 00:41:51,797
Huh? That's right?

774
00:41:52,178 --> 00:41:53,672
Find Mr. Amuro!

775
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,366
Uh, Mr. Amuro?

776
00:41:56,541 --> 00:41:58,884
Sorry, but I don't believe I've seen him here today.

777
00:41:59,185 --> 00:42:01,729
Well, that's because Mr. Amuro took the day off.

778
00:42:02,578 --> 00:42:07,338
He called this morning to tell me he needed a
personal day, and that's the last I heard from him.

779
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:11,265
I called him back a few times,
but no luck. I'm kind of worried.

780
00:42:11,452 --> 00:42:13,352
Huh... Did you catch all that?

781
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,221
I hope he's okay. Now I'm worried too...

782
00:42:19,222 --> 00:42:21,805
Mr. Amuro. Don't tell me he's.

783
00:42:38,315 --> 00:42:40,793
This is Stout. I'm currently sitting on the bus.

784
00:42:40,999 --> 00:42:42,779
Await further instructions.

785
00:42:43,184 --> 00:42:44,154
Roger that.

786
00:42:54,023 --> 00:42:55,270
I'm sorry Stout.

787
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:58,136
I am... You had my trust.

788
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:59,431
Too bad.

789
00:43:01,614 --> 00:43:03,254
Stout has been executed.

790
00:43:03,499 --> 00:43:05,089
Make your way back at once.

791
00:43:05,161 --> 00:43:06,383
Right. Copy that.

792
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:18,922
For 32 years, the CN tower was
the tallest building in the world!

793
00:43:19,581 --> 00:43:24,188
The edge walks takes you all
around the 116th floor of the tow!

794
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:29,040
Putting you 356 meters above the ground!

795
00:43:29,193 --> 00:43:30,956
Now as you may have noticed, from up here...

796
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,540
 Wow, look up there!

797
00:43:32,755 --> 00:43:33,826
Hey, yeah!

798
00:43:33,905 --> 00:43:35,089
That helicopter... Hey, yeah!

799
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,410
It can't be...

800
00:43:50,548 --> 00:43:52,512
Hmph, you got lucky.

801
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:55,087
For a spy there could be no better death.

802
00:43:56,589 --> 00:43:58,230
Aquavit has been terminated.

803
00:43:58,472 --> 00:44:00,442
Good work. You can head back now.

804
00:44:00,831 --> 00:44:03,587
Tsk, I know. I'm on my way!

805
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:14,385
Now just where do you think you're going?

806
00:44:15,036 --> 00:44:17,690
I thought I told you, you get one minute.

807
00:44:17,896 --> 00:44:20,804
And I thought I told you that I'm not a NOC, understand?

808
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:23,687
Maybe not, but it's time for us to find out.

809
00:44:27,136 --> 00:44:29,528
Right? Ms. Riesling.

810
00:44:30,711 --> 00:44:36,015
Each of us has taken a side in this
battle. Now let's clear things up a little.

811
00:44:37,439 --> 00:44:41,427
Tell me the names of the other rats
that have infiltrated the Organization.

812
00:44:43,106 --> 00:44:45,798
Do what he says, or you suffer. Got it?

813
00:44:45,902 --> 00:44:48,824
Listen to me, I keep telling
you! I'm not a NOC, all right?

814
00:44:48,946 --> 00:44:50,660
So, there's no need for threats!

815
00:44:51,368 --> 00:44:55,984
Really? Well you should know me well
enough to realize that I never make threats.

816
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,675
Five.

817
00:44:58,597 --> 00:44:59,565
Four.

818
00:45:01,088 --> 00:45:02,061
Three.

819
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:03,761
Two.

820
00:45:04,445 --> 00:45:05,135
One.

821
00:45:05,946 --> 00:45:06,787
Zero.

822
00:45:25,197 --> 00:45:26,778
Let's go. Hurry.

823
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,573
Hm? Where are we going?

824
00:45:28,794 --> 00:45:29,462
Japan.

825
00:45:29,607 --> 00:45:31,093
Huh? You mean...

826
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:33,246
Only two are remaining.

827
00:45:34,846 --> 00:45:35,312
Hmph.

828
00:45:41,023 --> 00:45:46,083
The English MI6, the Canadian CSIS, the German BND.

829
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:50,326
Someone's been systematically assassinating
their agents one after the other.

830
00:45:50,535 --> 00:45:51,415
Then that means...

831
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:51,979
Mhm.

832
00:45:52,169 --> 00:45:56,301
What all the victims all had in common was
that they each infiltrated the Organization.

833
00:45:56,514 --> 00:45:58,923
So this is the work of the men in black?

834
00:45:59,012 --> 00:46:01,308
We just received a report from Mr. Akai.

835
00:46:01,348 --> 00:46:06,703
that a spy from the Black Organization may have
stolen classified data from the National Police Agency.

836
00:46:07,569 --> 00:46:09,594
A spy... I wonder...

837
00:46:09,959 --> 00:46:10,999
Ms. Jodie.

838
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:16,799
Just to be clear. You called me here because
I got in touch with that spy, didn't you?

839
00:46:16,945 --> 00:46:17,491
Right.

840
00:46:17,773 --> 00:46:21,089
I thought so... But if she's been suffering from amnesia,

841
00:46:21,303 --> 00:46:23,878
and her cellphone could have held that information...

842
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,238
Cellphone? Do you know if she
had that phone in her possession?

843
00:46:27,492 --> 00:46:31,013
Mhm. She left it on the bench,
so I'm just borrowing it for now.

844
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:34,476
Then you should send it to the
FBI to have it analyzed right away.

845
00:46:35,019 --> 00:46:35,594
He's right.

846
00:46:35,618 --> 00:46:36,392
Wait a minute.

847
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,350
Doc said he was going to try to recover that data.

848
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,405
I think we should give him a chance first.

849
00:46:42,151 --> 00:46:44,885
Fine, then let us know as soon as it's been analyzed.

850
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,355
We need to find out just how much has been leaked.

851
00:46:47,649 --> 00:46:49,206
And we need to find out now.

852
00:46:49,445 --> 00:46:51,382
Or we'll have a panic on our hands.

853
00:46:52,144 --> 00:46:54,766
But, what kind of information's been stolen?

854
00:46:55,256 --> 00:46:56,507
Non-Official Cover.

855
00:46:57,517 --> 00:46:58,486
So you're saying...

856
00:46:58,804 --> 00:47:00,854
Right, this is the NOC List.

857
00:47:00,925 --> 00:47:04,390
Agents from all over the world that the NPA had on file.

858
00:47:04,693 --> 00:47:05,551
Targets...

859
00:47:06,192 --> 00:47:09,602
Every one of the agents who've
infiltrated the Black Organization...

860
00:47:09,764 --> 00:47:10,818
But that's not all.

861
00:47:11,343 --> 00:47:13,169
If the NOC List does go public,

862
00:47:13,304 --> 00:47:16,753
intelligence agencies across
the globe could collapse entirely.

863
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,044
That means... Right now they control the
most powerful weapon in the intelligence war?

864
00:47:22,236 --> 00:47:24,009
Correct. If so...

865
00:47:24,531 --> 00:47:29,760
These three assassinations may be
nothing more than the tip of the iceberg.

866
00:47:30,187 --> 00:47:31,206
Hm...

867
00:47:39,319 --> 00:47:41,042
Guess we're really doing this.

868
00:47:41,248 --> 00:47:45,120
Do you think it's okay that we're
keeping it secret from Ai and Conan?

869
00:47:45,145 --> 00:47:49,146
It's fine! After all, if we told them
about it they'd say we shouldn't do it!

870
00:47:49,514 --> 00:47:53,081
Come on, we need to go inside!
We might still be able to see her!

871
00:47:53,124 --> 00:47:53,910
Yeah!

872
00:47:54,427 --> 00:47:58,279
Yes, yes that's correct. The Touto Police Hospital.

873
00:47:58,993 --> 00:48:02,704
I'm counting on you, all right
Kazami? So don't let me down.

874
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:03,601
Yes, sir.

875
00:48:08,403 --> 00:48:08,964
Huh?

876
00:48:12,238 --> 00:48:14,828
Bourbon! Well, fancy meeting you here.

877
00:48:14,986 --> 00:48:17,863
I just showed up to take her right back where she belongs.

878
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:23,230
Hah, I would have thought you'd be here to shut
her up before she was able to regain her memory.

879
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:25,670
And what would make me do something like that?

880
00:48:26,045 --> 00:48:28,381
I have no idea what you're talking about.

881
00:48:28,825 --> 00:48:31,535
Then just how do you plan to get a hold of her?

882
00:48:31,813 --> 00:48:35,189
She's under strict surveillance
and can't see any visitors.

883
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:38,844
Unless you have access to
certain resources I'm not aware of?

884
00:48:39,481 --> 00:48:42,769
Like a contact within the police department, for example?

885
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,266
Guess I'll say it again? I don't
know what you're talking about.

886
00:48:46,561 --> 00:48:51,048
Maybe we should go somewhere more private to talk?

887
00:48:52,703 --> 00:48:56,824
Well, if that's what the Organization
wants, then how could I possibly refuse?

888
00:49:01,368 --> 00:49:02,298
How'd it go?

889
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:05,119
Not good. I guess she can't see anyone.

890
00:49:05,365 --> 00:49:06,438
Are you serious?

891
00:49:06,598 --> 00:49:08,814
Do you think that means she's really sick...?

892
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:11,585
I'm not too sure, but we can try and find out?

893
00:49:11,793 --> 00:49:13,398
Wait, you can do that?

894
00:49:13,843 --> 00:49:14,257
Yep!

895
00:49:14,328 --> 00:49:14,955
Woah!

896
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:15,931
I get it!

897
00:49:16,306 --> 00:49:18,905
See? Maybe Officer Takagi can help!

898
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:26,425
Doc!

899
00:49:26,457 --> 00:49:26,682
Huh?

900
00:49:27,598 --> 00:49:28,756
So how's coming?

901
00:49:29,264 --> 00:49:33,292
Well I'm almost certain I'll be able to
recover the last few messages she sent out.

902
00:49:33,578 --> 00:49:34,698
You've gotta hurry!

903
00:49:34,954 --> 00:49:36,225
I-I'll do what I can!

904
00:49:36,582 --> 00:49:39,179
How about this?!

905
00:49:39,432 --> 00:49:41,562
Genta, you're not supposed to do that.

906
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:43,558
Heh, oh yeah. My bad!

907
00:49:44,202 --> 00:49:45,290
Oh! Takagi!

908
00:49:45,353 --> 00:49:47,321
Yay! He's finally back!

909
00:49:47,346 --> 00:49:48,330
How is she?

910
00:49:48,421 --> 00:49:49,436
 Can we see her?

911
00:49:49,495 --> 00:49:50,193
Shhh!

912
00:49:50,543 --> 00:49:53,656
Be quiet! You can't be here, it's a secret!

913
00:49:53,814 --> 00:49:55,177
A secret from who?

914
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:55,451
Urk!

915
00:49:55,897 --> 00:49:58,560
S-Sorry sir. Just talking to the kids!

916
00:49:58,661 --> 00:50:00,178
Oh! Hi, Miss!

917
00:50:00,402 --> 00:50:01,935
You look so much better!

918
00:50:02,013 --> 00:50:04,499
You don't have that headache anymore, do you?

919
00:50:04,563 --> 00:50:08,083
Oh no, I feel just fine now. Thanks so much.

920
00:50:08,245 --> 00:50:11,349
Under normal circumstances, you
wouldn't be able to see her at all.

921
00:50:11,612 --> 00:50:15,083
But she seems to have developed
something of an attachment to you kids.ct

922
00:50:15,108 --> 00:50:18,141
So we hope that seeing you
will help her get her memory back.

923
00:50:18,426 --> 00:50:19,303
You mean it?

924
00:50:19,328 --> 00:50:20,628
Thank you very much!

925
00:50:20,905 --> 00:50:24,172
Okay. Then you can visit until
her next interview, all right?

926
00:50:24,247 --> 00:50:25,347
Yaay!

927
00:50:27,334 --> 00:50:28,001
There!

928
00:50:29,447 --> 00:50:31,314
What should my next move be?

929
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:34,230
Well if I were you, I'd go right here.

930
00:50:34,668 --> 00:50:35,453
Okay.

931
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,140
How about that?

932
00:50:38,251 --> 00:50:38,517
Huh.

933
00:50:38,541 --> 00:50:39,991
What do we do?

934
00:50:40,072 --> 00:50:41,356
Guess we're kind of stuck.

935
00:50:41,381 --> 00:50:43,175
We did it! We beat them, lady!

936
00:50:43,282 --> 00:50:44,112
We did!

937
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,198
Oh, I forgot!

938
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:48,463
Here! This is for you.

939
00:50:48,638 --> 00:50:50,710
Huh? Is that..?

940
00:50:51,028 --> 00:50:53,628
Yeah! The guy at the dart game wanted you to have it!

941
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,948
He said you can paint it any color too!

942
00:50:56,139 --> 00:50:58,507
You mean this is really mine? Are you sure?

943
00:50:58,602 --> 00:51:02,264
Yeah! It's the least that we
could do after you saved my life!

944
00:51:02,725 --> 00:51:03,813
And with yours...

945
00:51:04,107 --> 00:51:06,013
Now we all have the same one!

946
00:51:06,283 --> 00:51:09,144
That's right! So what color do you want it to be?

947
00:51:09,335 --> 00:51:10,426
Purple? Or pink?

948
00:51:10,451 --> 00:51:13,443
Or black, so it looks like a killer whale!

949
00:51:13,705 --> 00:51:16,884
I think white suits you a whole
lot better than black though.

950
00:51:16,909 --> 00:51:17,330
Ah...

951
00:51:17,481 --> 00:51:18,840
I mean your hair is white!

952
00:51:18,957 --> 00:51:21,825
If you leave it that way, you don't have to pay for paint!

953
00:51:21,888 --> 00:51:24,297
I don't think that's the point, Genta...

954
00:51:24,385 --> 00:51:26,480
You sound like some kind of salesman...

955
00:51:26,657 --> 00:51:28,332
Just throwing it out there!

956
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,947
Woah!

957
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:33,505
Are you okay?

958
00:51:33,898 --> 00:51:36,125
Yeah. Sorry to spoil the fun.

959
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:37,952
Is everyone all rig?

960
00:51:38,063 --> 00:51:38,302
Uh-huh.

961
00:51:38,341 --> 00:51:38,642
Yeah.

962
00:51:38,667 --> 00:51:39,367
Aah!!

963
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,765
We were winning the game, too!

964
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:43,989
She was winning, not you!

965
00:51:44,013 --> 00:51:44,460
Huh?!

966
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:47,646
You were just doing whatever she told you to .

967
00:51:48,043 --> 00:51:49,577
I guess you could say that.

968
00:51:49,687 --> 00:51:50,403
Heheh...

969
00:51:50,999 --> 00:51:51,701
Excuse me.

970
00:51:51,725 --> 00:51:52,506
Huh?

971
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,702
My name is Yuya Kazami.

972
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:59,102
An assistant inspector representing
the Public Security Bureau.

973
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:01,716
Ah... Would you happen to be Inspector Megure?

974
00:52:02,057 --> 00:52:04,266
That's me. I'm the one who's in charge here.

975
00:52:04,943 --> 00:52:08,121
We're in charge. We're taking
over from this moment forward.

976
00:52:08,462 --> 00:52:12,220
Why's that? I believe we have
jurisdiction to investigate, don't we?

977
00:52:12,537 --> 00:52:15,786
She's suspected of infiltrating
the National Police Agency.

978
00:52:16,254 --> 00:52:18,831
We have to begin interrogating her immediately.

979
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,499
Now that you're aware of the situation,

980
00:52:21,524 --> 00:52:24,738
we'd like you to fill out the papers
necessary to hand her over to us.

981
00:52:25,327 --> 00:52:28,101
I'm afraid you have no choice in the matter what so ever.

982
00:52:30,643 --> 00:52:31,441
Very well.

983
00:52:31,465 --> 00:52:32,160
Huh?

984
00:52:32,366 --> 00:52:35,679
The application form is ready. Right this way please.

985
00:52:37,665 --> 00:52:39,946
But, what's gonna happen to you, Miss?

986
00:52:39,988 --> 00:52:40,726
I don't know.

987
00:52:41,098 --> 00:52:43,665
It sounds like your visit with her is over now children.

988
00:52:43,879 --> 00:52:44,928
Let's head back home.

989
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:45,912
Aww...

990
00:52:46,922 --> 00:52:49,108
Come on, let's get you back to your room, shall we?

991
00:52:49,265 --> 00:52:49,940
Right.

992
00:52:50,102 --> 00:52:51,301
No, don't go!

993
00:52:51,326 --> 00:52:52,571
You're just gonna leave?

994
00:52:54,279 --> 00:52:55,390
Wait... Miss!

995
00:52:56,064 --> 00:52:59,768
I want to thank you for everything.
I'll always treasure this time.

996
00:53:00,396 --> 00:53:01,507
Good-bye miss...

997
00:53:02,106 --> 00:53:05,243
Not good-bye. One day we'll ride the Ferris wheel again.

998
00:53:05,577 --> 00:53:06,431
You really think so?!

999
00:53:06,455 --> 00:53:07,578
It's a date!

1000
00:53:07,873 --> 00:53:09,389
We should probably be going.

1001
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:18,517
I sure hope that she's gonna be okay...

1002
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:20,495
Yeah, I'm worried about her...

1003
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,463
Me too...

1004
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:25,523
Oh, Shinichi!

1005
00:53:25,666 --> 00:53:27,303
I just ran the analysis.

1006
00:53:27,429 --> 00:53:28,543
And what does it say?

1007
00:53:29,146 --> 00:53:29,630
Look.

1008
00:53:30,814 --> 00:53:35,010
NOC are Stout, Aquavit, Riesling,
and the others you suspected...

1009
00:53:36,225 --> 00:53:37,291
Bourbon and Kir..!

1010
00:53:37,791 --> 00:53:38,928
I thought so!

1011
00:53:39,379 --> 00:53:42,957
Try to find out where that message
was sent as soon as possible, Doc!

1012
00:53:42,983 --> 00:53:43,407
Right!

1013
00:53:43,448 --> 00:53:45,652
Be sure to call me the minute you know more!

1014
00:53:49,783 --> 00:53:50,259
Huh?

1015
00:53:51,031 --> 00:53:51,888
What is it?

1016
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:55,344
Kudo... Please.

1017
00:53:57,895 --> 00:53:59,706
I told you before, didn't I?

1018
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:02,423
You shouldn't ever try to run from your destiny.

1019
00:54:03,563 --> 00:54:05,538
And I'm not gonna run either.

1020
00:54:15,066 --> 00:54:16,304
My destiny..?

1021
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:18,639
Thank you, Officer!

1022
00:54:18,951 --> 00:54:21,127
Yeah, thanks for helping us like that.

1023
00:54:21,226 --> 00:54:23,695
Sure. Now be careful going home.

1024
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,385
Okay!

1025
00:54:25,043 --> 00:54:25,647
Hm?

1026
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:28,323
Come on Genta, cheer up.

1027
00:54:28,742 --> 00:54:30,574
We'll see her again some day.

1028
00:54:30,941 --> 00:54:32,322
But what if we don't?

1029
00:54:32,457 --> 00:54:36,128
I know! Do you guys wanna go
ride the Ferris wheel right now?

1030
00:54:36,455 --> 00:54:37,082
Yeah!

1031
00:54:37,129 --> 00:54:39,592
She just said she wanted to ride it with us again.

1032
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:41,870
Let's go take some pictures we can send her!

1033
00:54:42,347 --> 00:54:44,740
Well if we go now, we'll get there at night.

1034
00:54:45,001 --> 00:54:47,655
And it'll be so crowded, we might not get on.

1035
00:54:48,022 --> 00:54:49,354
It'll be all right.

1036
00:54:49,379 --> 00:54:53,281
I'm willing to bet, the Suzuki
Group invested in the Aquarium.

1037
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:54,654
See?

1038
00:54:55,523 --> 00:54:56,038
Oh!

1039
00:54:56,063 --> 00:54:56,943
You're right!

1040
00:54:57,186 --> 00:55:00,650
Yeah! Pretty awesome to have someone like her on our side!

1041
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:04,910
You think we're NOC? Seriously?

1042
00:55:06,071 --> 00:55:08,095
Curaçao sent us a list.

1043
00:55:09,797 --> 00:55:11,376
And your names were on it.

1044
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,547
Curaçao? She's Rum's right-hand.

1045
00:55:15,643 --> 00:55:18,591
Yeah, and an information collecting specialist.

1046
00:55:18,781 --> 00:55:20,163
So you're aware of her.

1047
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:24,606
We're aware that among other things,
she's known for having "odd eyes".

1048
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:26,925
Everyone in the Organization's heard of her.

1049
00:55:27,341 --> 00:55:32,360
We're old friends. So tell me now,
and I'll make your deaths painless.

1050
00:55:32,385 --> 00:55:35,132
Hmph. You kidnapped us to get a confession?

1051
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:38,446
If you trusted Curaçao we'd be dead already.

1052
00:55:39,271 --> 00:55:40,297
Isn't that right?

1053
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:43,308
Heh. Ever the detective huh, Bourbon?

1054
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,280
She retrieved the NOC list as planned...

1055
00:55:46,828 --> 00:55:50,030
But the police found her and
she crashed while trying to flee.

1056
00:55:50,455 --> 00:55:52,899
And that's how she ended up with amnesia.

1057
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:57,531
If that's true, then why don't you
go find her and get the NOC list back?

1058
00:55:58,031 --> 00:56:03,590
Come on! I think we both know you have more than
enough time to confirm who we are before you do this!

1059
00:56:04,226 --> 00:56:06,888
You've got a point. However...

1060
00:56:11,506 --> 00:56:12,094
Gin!

1061
00:56:12,133 --> 00:56:12,689
Hang on!

1062
00:56:13,473 --> 00:56:17,639
Punish the suspicious. That's just how I do things.

1063
00:56:18,272 --> 00:56:19,010
Now.

1064
00:56:20,228 --> 00:56:23,772
It's time for the traitors to get what's coming to them.

1065
00:56:24,567 --> 00:56:25,782
You done yet, Doc?!

1066
00:56:26,259 --> 00:56:26,795
Calm down.

1067
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:27,220
Huh?

1068
00:56:27,841 --> 00:56:29,525
We should know in about 30 seconds.

1069
00:56:29,863 --> 00:56:30,501
Okay.

1070
00:56:31,017 --> 00:56:33,949
Once you have the address, do just what I told you!

1071
00:56:34,203 --> 00:56:39,105
I remember. I should make it look like the
message came from this broken cellphone, right?

1072
00:56:39,465 --> 00:56:42,020
Yeah, and hurry! There's no time!

1073
00:56:42,736 --> 00:56:44,072
There, it's finished!

1074
00:56:44,356 --> 00:56:46,360
Uh...! He just hung up?!

1075
00:56:47,162 --> 00:56:47,543
Huh?

1076
00:56:52,634 --> 00:56:53,794
Right this way, Conan!

1077
00:56:55,183 --> 00:56:56,989
You need to read this, rig away!

1078
00:56:57,171 --> 00:56:57,510
What?

1079
00:56:57,577 --> 00:56:58,418
Huh?

1080
00:56:59,318 --> 00:57:00,969
No... Is that really..?

1081
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:05,498
Kir!

1082
00:57:07,452 --> 00:57:10,867
But you were so close, Kir. Please, continue.

1083
00:57:11,853 --> 00:57:13,871
You want the handcuffs off, don'tcha?

1084
00:57:14,085 --> 00:57:16,760
But she's one of us! How could you?!

1085
00:57:17,383 --> 00:57:20,670
I'll be the judge of who's one of us and who's not.

1086
00:57:20,982 --> 00:57:23,845
I'm gonna give you just one more minute.

1087
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,617
Whoever sells out their partner first gets to watch.

1088
00:57:28,046 --> 00:57:30,430
And see how a rat's exterminated.

1089
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,313
Vodka, start the countdown.

1090
00:57:34,456 --> 00:57:37,714
From 60. Starting now.

1091
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:42,149
We are not gonna fall for that!

1092
00:57:42,268 --> 00:57:46,718
If I told you that she was a NOC, then
I'd just be admitting I was on that list too!

1093
00:57:47,202 --> 00:57:49,332
After that, there's no way you'd let me go.

1094
00:57:49,443 --> 00:57:50,213
Forty five.

1095
00:57:50,308 --> 00:57:52,746
Heh, how certain are you about that?

1096
00:57:52,984 --> 00:57:56,742
I'm a pretty nice guy, aren't I? Try me.

1097
00:57:58,126 --> 00:57:59,022
Fourth one.

1098
00:58:01,494 --> 00:58:04,839
So each of you is trying to
protect the other one, is that it?

1099
00:58:05,188 --> 00:58:09,311
Now listen, I am not protecting her. I
don't even know if she's a NOC or not!

1100
00:58:09,374 --> 00:58:12,053
Bourbon's right! I don't know about him!

1101
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:13,792
But I am not a traitor!

1102
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:15,381
That's what I was saying!

1103
00:58:15,656 --> 00:58:16,587
Well...

1104
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:17,860
Twenty seconds.

1105
00:58:18,091 --> 00:58:19,686
Which one's the rat?

1106
00:58:20,529 --> 00:58:22,254
You're not really gonna do this..?

1107
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:24,685
Who's going to be the first to break?

1108
00:58:25,106 --> 00:58:26,615
Ten, nine,

1109
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:28,117
eight, seven,

1110
00:58:28,142 --> 00:58:30,611
So, is it Bourbon? Or Kir?

1111
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:33,240
four, three, two,

1112
00:58:33,312 --> 00:58:34,672
First, I'll go with...

1113
00:58:34,934 --> 00:58:35,839
zero!

1114
00:58:36,327 --> 00:58:37,037
Bourbon!

1115
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:44,895
Huh...

1116
00:58:50,344 --> 00:58:50,825
Huh?

1117
00:58:54,422 --> 00:58:55,635
Wait. What happened?

1118
00:58:55,686 --> 00:58:56,337
The lights!

1119
00:58:56,439 --> 00:58:58,862
Stay right where you are! Don't move!

1120
00:59:00,372 --> 00:59:00,777
Huh?

1121
00:59:01,461 --> 00:59:03,025
Hey! Where's Bourbon?!

1122
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:04,329
He's gone!

1123
00:59:05,034 --> 00:59:06,081
Damn it, how?!

1124
00:59:07,806 --> 00:59:09,321
Wait a minute, after him!

1125
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,805
Uh... Ah.

1126
00:59:15,659 --> 00:59:20,149
Apologies, Kir! I guess you won't get to see a dead rat.

1127
00:59:20,506 --> 00:59:22,358
But no need to feel lonely.

1128
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:25,552
Bourbon will join you before long. I promise.

1129
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:27,292
Good-bye, Kir.

1130
00:59:27,316 --> 00:59:28,182
Gin wait!

1131
00:59:28,847 --> 00:59:31,164
Don't shoot! That's straight from Rum.

1132
00:59:31,284 --> 00:59:31,784
What?

1133
00:59:32,513 --> 00:59:36,302
Then what should we do..? Right... Copy that.

1134
00:59:36,658 --> 00:59:37,134
Tsk.

1135
00:59:38,518 --> 00:59:41,070
We just received a message from Curaçao.

1136
00:59:42,102 --> 00:59:44,033
Those two weren't involved.

1137
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:46,495
You're saying she got her memory back?

1138
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:50,807
I guess that means, that Bourbon
and I aren't suspects anymore, huh?

1139
00:59:51,498 --> 00:59:54,373
Now hurry up and get me out of these damn handcuffs!

1140
00:59:55,035 --> 00:59:55,392
No.

1141
00:59:55,424 --> 00:59:55,725
Huh?

1142
00:59:56,369 --> 00:59:58,856
That isn't the extent of Rum's message.

1143
00:59:59,292 --> 01:00:04,107
It also says that we need to confirm
whether it actually came from Curaçao herself.

1144
01:00:04,844 --> 01:00:09,550
However, getting her back here from the
police hospital may prove to be quite the ordeal.

1145
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,226
Don't you worry about that.

1146
01:00:11,767 --> 01:00:15,953
Because if my instincts prove to be
correct, something else is about to happen.

1147
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:22,120
Nice timing, Gin!

1148
01:00:22,571 --> 01:00:25,901
Those guys at the Public
Security Bureau are finally moving.

1149
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:30,660
Those fools don't have any idea
that they're being wire-tapped.

1150
01:00:31,057 --> 01:00:32,479
And our destination?

1151
01:00:32,728 --> 01:00:35,404
Hah. It's exactly where you said it would be.

1152
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:38,907
She's being shoved into the car as we speak.

1153
01:00:39,368 --> 01:00:40,828
Get the aircraft ready.

1154
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:42,404
You mean...?

1155
01:00:43,818 --> 01:00:47,669
You wanna see what it can do? Now's the perfect time.

1156
01:00:48,221 --> 01:00:50,674
I hope you don't plan to start a war or something.

1157
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,852
It's an order from Rum.

1158
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:56,886
We have to make sure the mission's a complete success.

1159
01:00:56,978 --> 01:00:57,482
Roger.

1160
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:01,040
Oh man, oh man!

1161
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:03,575
I'm having so much fun it's crazy!

1162
01:01:03,857 --> 01:01:04,868
Same here.

1163
01:01:05,577 --> 01:01:07,976
You can't be serious about using that thing!

1164
01:01:08,515 --> 01:01:11,138
It's no good, he got away boss.

1165
01:01:11,829 --> 01:01:12,704
That's fine.

1166
01:01:12,886 --> 01:01:13,269
Huh?

1167
01:01:13,706 --> 01:01:16,430
We'll take care of Bourbon and Kir a bit later.

1168
01:01:16,621 --> 01:01:18,893
First, let's go get Curaçao back.

1169
01:01:18,956 --> 01:01:21,601
But... What about all the cops at the hospital?

1170
01:01:22,244 --> 01:01:24,336
She already left the hospital.

1171
01:01:24,664 --> 01:01:25,661
Then where is she?

1172
01:01:26,201 --> 01:01:29,586
Simple really. The Touto Aquarium.

1173
01:01:29,808 --> 01:01:33,917
Gin! Does this mean you knew it
was going to turn out like this?

1174
01:01:34,163 --> 01:01:36,498
Hmph. Come on, Vodka.

1175
01:01:36,814 --> 01:01:37,823
Get the car.

1176
01:01:38,105 --> 01:01:38,601
Right!

1177
01:01:41,805 --> 01:01:44,602
Yes. Understood. You head over there now.

1178
01:01:45,396 --> 01:01:47,646
We'll take care of mounting the rescue ourselves.

1179
01:01:47,718 --> 01:01:48,075
Got it.

1180
01:01:48,749 --> 01:01:51,064
It sounds like those two made it out safely.

1181
01:01:51,453 --> 01:01:52,704
I'm glad to her it.

1182
01:01:52,728 --> 01:01:53,747
That's excellent.

1183
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:56,331
Seems your strategy worked out perfectly.

1184
01:01:56,482 --> 01:01:57,750
It was nothing, really.

1185
01:01:57,774 --> 01:01:58,190
Huh?

1186
01:01:58,310 --> 01:02:01,035
There was an incomplete sentence in the last message.

1187
01:02:01,234 --> 01:02:04,243
So I figured all I had to do
was finish it with the phrase,

1188
01:02:04,268 --> 01:02:07,144
"those two aren't involved,
there's no need to worry about them."

1189
01:02:07,501 --> 01:02:09,360
Right, and now they'll be fine.

1190
01:02:09,616 --> 01:02:09,988
Yeah.

1191
01:02:10,013 --> 01:02:10,457
No.

1192
01:02:10,663 --> 01:02:12,880
We've only fixed things temporarily.

1193
01:02:13,132 --> 01:02:18,313
Because now the enemy is making their way to
the aquarium to try and get their agent back.

1194
01:02:18,686 --> 01:02:20,512
Isn't she at the police hospital?

1195
01:02:20,632 --> 01:02:24,740
Afraid not. It appears the NPA has
taken her right back to the aquarium.

1196
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:26,153
It doesn't make sense...

1197
01:02:26,354 --> 01:02:27,124
Then, let's go.

1198
01:02:27,224 --> 01:02:29,571
Relax, Mr. Akai is heading there now.

1199
01:02:30,261 --> 01:02:34,410
We're going to rescue the intelligence agents
that were left back in the warehouse district.

1200
01:02:34,535 --> 01:02:36,828
Then, search for the NOC List.

1201
01:02:36,852 --> 01:02:37,427
Right!

1202
01:02:37,826 --> 01:02:38,420
Conan,

1203
01:02:38,723 --> 01:02:43,188
I believe this is your stop. It would be
far too dangerous for you to tag along with us.

1204
01:02:43,236 --> 01:02:43,815
But I...

1205
01:02:44,078 --> 01:02:44,887
Don't worry!

1206
01:02:45,411 --> 01:02:48,288
I give you my word that the FBI is gonna deliver.

1207
01:02:49,594 --> 01:02:49,977
Hm.

1208
01:02:52,315 --> 01:02:53,507
I'm counting on you..!

1209
01:02:54,444 --> 01:02:56,604
Hm. We'll contact you when it's all been settled.

1210
01:02:56,629 --> 01:02:59,314
Hm. Oh, one more thing!

1211
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:02,528
How much did Mr. Akai know about that spy?

1212
01:03:03,305 --> 01:03:05,284
Not very much from what I understand.

1213
01:03:05,411 --> 01:03:08,454
She goes by the code name Curaçao and is Rum's confidant.

1214
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,995
That's the extent of the info we've gathered on her.

1215
01:03:11,431 --> 01:03:12,890
Thanks. Be careful!

1216
01:03:17,556 --> 01:03:19,880
She's not Rum, but Curaçao.

1217
01:03:21,223 --> 01:03:24,219
That's a liquor made with dried orange peels...

1218
01:03:25,121 --> 01:03:27,353
There are several common varieties,

1219
01:03:27,497 --> 01:03:33,466
white, orange, blue, green, and red curaçao.

1220
01:03:38,082 --> 01:03:39,067
I wonder...

1221
01:03:40,776 --> 01:03:42,031
Five colors...

1222
01:03:42,976 --> 01:03:45,703
I've seen this arrangement somewhere before...

1223
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:48,148
Where? Come on, think!

1224
01:03:50,697 --> 01:03:52,206
Wait I remember!

1225
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:55,565
We discovered some very unusual damager to her fornix..

1226
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:59,875
She's holding her head and moaning! She's
talking but I don't know what it means..!

1227
01:04:00,313 --> 01:04:04,315
Uh... She said Stout, Aquavit, then Riesling after that.

1228
01:04:06,546 --> 01:04:11,940
Yeah... If I'm right about , it explains what
Public Safety and the Organization are planning!

1229
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:13,673
Which means...

1230
01:04:14,037 --> 01:04:15,937
Oh no! I've gotta hurry!

1231
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:18,362
They're about to get the NOC list!

1232
01:04:21,063 --> 01:04:21,520
Woah!

1233
01:04:21,663 --> 01:04:22,118
Ah..!

1234
01:04:23,589 --> 01:04:26,990
Right, yes. We have her in custody now, Sir.

1235
01:04:27,561 --> 01:04:30,118
What? You want us to ride the Ferris wheel?

1236
01:04:30,642 --> 01:04:34,386
Yeah. It's pretty risky but it's all we've got right now.

1237
01:04:35,132 --> 01:04:36,310
You'll do it, won't you?

1238
01:04:36,603 --> 01:04:38,669
Yes. Let's hurry and meet up.

1239
01:04:39,168 --> 01:04:42,397
Not yet, the Organization has eyes everywhere.

1240
01:04:42,736 --> 01:04:45,550
I'll see you at the Ferris wheel, all right? Be safe.

1241
01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:47,472
Mr. Furuya! Wait!

1242
01:04:49,688 --> 01:04:50,370
Hmm...

1243
01:04:54,693 --> 01:04:57,354
I already told you, it's Golden Week!

1244
01:04:57,742 --> 01:05:00,175
Why do I have to come to the aquarium?

1245
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:03,765
And with the brats no less. Hmph.

1246
01:05:04,118 --> 01:05:05,269
Well, we're here.

1247
01:05:05,579 --> 01:05:06,341
Finally!

1248
01:05:06,366 --> 01:05:07,476
All right!

1249
01:05:08,175 --> 01:05:09,828
Hey, don't run off you guys!

1250
01:05:09,858 --> 01:05:10,967
Wait for me, okay?

1251
01:05:11,042 --> 01:05:11,896
 Okay!

1252
01:05:12,251 --> 01:05:13,863
So you're just gonna stay here?

1253
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,560
Yeah, I'm not in the mood for fish right now.

1254
01:05:17,034 --> 01:05:20,030
I'm just gonna take a nap, you go have fun.

1255
01:05:20,442 --> 01:05:21,577
See you later then.

1256
01:05:31,343 --> 01:05:32,724
I'll go have a talk with them.

1257
01:05:32,925 --> 01:05:33,527
Right.

1258
01:05:36,233 --> 01:05:37,265
Back again, huh?

1259
01:05:37,502 --> 01:05:40,805
I'd figured they wanna take her to the
scene of the accident for questioning.

1260
01:05:41,027 --> 01:05:43,863
She had some kind of panic attack on the Ferris wheel.

1261
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:46,794
Might be something there that's worth looking into.

1262
01:05:47,493 --> 01:05:50,530
Then I say we all stay here
for a while and keep an eye out.

1263
01:05:50,855 --> 01:05:51,307
Right.

1264
01:05:51,713 --> 01:05:54,097
Where's Sonoko? Do you guys see her?

1265
01:05:54,153 --> 01:05:56,296
No not yet, but she ought to be here any minute now.

1266
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,744
We'd like to ride the Ferris wheel.

1267
01:05:57,933 --> 01:06:02,795
I'm very sorry sir, but unfortunately we've already
stopped selling tickets for our attractions this evening.

1268
01:06:02,924 --> 01:06:07,889
Then if you wouldn't mind, tell the person who's in
charge that the PSB would appreciate their cooperation.

1269
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:09,661
Come on! Come on!

1270
01:06:09,814 --> 01:06:10,590
One moment please.

1271
01:06:10,614 --> 01:06:11,522
It's this way.

1272
01:06:12,417 --> 01:06:13,894
Look, she's here!

1273
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:15,101
Sonoko!

1274
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:17,900
Sorry, but the paperwork took forever!

1275
01:06:18,090 --> 01:06:21,515
All right! You did a great job, Sonoko!

1276
01:06:21,784 --> 01:06:24,254
You do appreciate the trouble I went through, right?

1277
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:25,440
Yeah!

1278
01:06:25,587 --> 01:06:28,625
Definitely, and thanks a lot
for letting me come along too.

1279
01:06:28,658 --> 01:06:31,136
It's the least I could do, so don't worry about it.

1280
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:33,440
Now, show them a good time, okay?

1281
01:06:33,473 --> 01:06:33,916
Right!

1282
01:06:34,368 --> 01:06:37,922
Now if you kids are all ready then
follow me and I'll take you to the ride!

1283
01:06:38,057 --> 01:06:38,700
Sure!

1284
01:06:38,725 --> 01:06:39,811
Oh yeah!

1285
01:06:41,854 --> 01:06:43,427
Are you sure she can handle it?

1286
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:46,756
Yep, she works here, so she knows how to deal with kids.

1287
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,332
By the way, why didn't you
want to invite Shinichi out here?

1288
01:06:50,658 --> 01:06:51,238
Hah?

1289
01:06:51,745 --> 01:06:54,315
What? Just tell security they need to be ready.

1290
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:56,657
Do you know that guy or something?

1291
01:06:56,689 --> 01:06:57,195
Mhm.

1292
01:06:57,310 --> 01:07:01,430
He looks like PSB, but I could swear
I've seen that woman somewhere before.

1293
01:07:01,586 --> 01:07:03,018
I wonder who she is.

1294
01:07:03,447 --> 01:07:05,486
PSB? Seriously?

1295
01:07:05,901 --> 01:07:07,704
I just hope everything's okay.

1296
01:07:10,898 --> 01:07:12,933
Rude! What's his problem?!

1297
01:07:13,151 --> 01:07:13,830
Come on!

1298
01:07:16,023 --> 01:07:17,280
Sorry, Sonoko.

1299
01:07:17,923 --> 01:07:20,561
But there's something bugging me bout those people.

1300
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:24,025
Come on, quit thinking about them,
and just get him on the phone, okay?

1301
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,476
Huh? Mm....

1302
01:07:34,355 --> 01:07:37,803
Huh? Damn it. If this one's ringing, then that means...

1303
01:07:38,358 --> 01:07:39,255
Thought so.

1304
01:07:40,757 --> 01:07:44,303
Hi, Shinichi. I've got something to tell you.

1305
01:07:45,154 --> 01:07:46,956
Well... Keep it short, all right?

1306
01:07:47,075 --> 01:07:47,575
Emm...

1307
01:07:47,875 --> 01:07:48,936
Uh... Are you busy or?

1308
01:07:48,961 --> 01:07:49,888
Yeah, kinda...

1309
01:07:49,986 --> 01:07:53,047
Just give me a minute! I'll tell you later okay?

1310
01:07:53,088 --> 01:07:54,770
Oh, man... Are you listening?

1311
01:07:54,954 --> 01:07:57,744
Sorry, but I'm really busy..! Gotta go!

1312
01:07:58,648 --> 01:07:59,801
Shinichi, wait!

1313
01:07:59,881 --> 01:08:01,715
I'll call you later when things settle down!

1314
01:08:02,023 --> 01:08:03,434
Huh? Where are you now?

1315
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:03,984
Bye..!

1316
01:08:05,237 --> 01:08:08,802
I can't believe that guy! He
said he was busy again, right?

1317
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:09,986
Mhm.

1318
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:12,196
I wonder what he's actually doing?

1319
01:08:12,439 --> 01:08:14,849
It sounded like he's here at the aquarium.

1320
01:08:14,874 --> 01:08:15,193
Huh?

1321
01:08:15,422 --> 01:08:16,398
Are you kidding?

1322
01:08:16,524 --> 01:08:19,592
That announcement that just
played. I heard it on his phone.

1323
01:08:20,457 --> 01:08:23,865
Oh, really? The question is, who's he here with?

1324
01:08:23,922 --> 01:08:24,515
Uh...

1325
01:08:24,786 --> 01:08:28,538
You don't honestly believe that a
boy would come here by himself, do you?

1326
01:08:28,943 --> 01:08:31,994
Now come on! The two of us need to
go and try to catch him in the act!

1327
01:08:32,374 --> 01:08:33,904
Sonoko, wait a minute!

1328
01:08:38,407 --> 01:08:40,957
There seems to be more than one power source.

1329
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,308
It's not the same as the old facilities.

1330
01:08:44,848 --> 01:08:45,951
Okay, then.

1331
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:50,137
Hmph.

1332
01:08:53,038 --> 01:08:55,573
All finished. Now, even if you do show up,

1333
01:08:55,789 --> 01:08:57,491
they aren't gonna find you.

1334
01:08:57,547 --> 01:08:58,618
Excellent work.

1335
01:08:59,887 --> 01:09:03,300
Step on it you two. We're starting up in just 15 minutes.

1336
01:09:03,325 --> 01:09:04,884
It sounds like a plan to me!

1337
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:14,726
We at the Touto Aquarium would like to thank
you for riding our Grand Ferris wheel today.

1338
01:09:14,822 --> 01:09:16,393
 We hope you enjoyed it!

1339
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:19,580
It's almost time for the special water and light show,

1340
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:23,150
but since we'll be doing a scheduled
maintenance check of the north wheel...

1341
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:27,560
only the south wheel will be
available until further notice.

1342
01:09:29,132 --> 01:09:30,665
Now, right this way!

1343
01:09:31,163 --> 01:09:32,396
Oh!

1344
01:09:32,421 --> 01:09:33,564
Shortcut!

1345
01:09:34,177 --> 01:09:35,703
Hang on, kiddos!

1346
01:09:35,745 --> 01:09:37,012
Hey, are these 3 with you?

1347
01:09:37,037 --> 01:09:39,237
Actually, they've come here with Ms. Suzuki.

1348
01:09:39,639 --> 01:09:43,885
Wait, you're saying an entire side
of the Ferris wheel is just for them?

1349
01:09:43,973 --> 01:09:44,853
Guess, so!

1350
01:09:49,637 --> 01:09:52,620
The water and light show will
be starting in just 30 minutes.

1351
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:55,608
Finding them in this crowd is
going to be almost impossible.

1352
01:09:55,934 --> 01:09:57,965
I've gotta stop them before they get on.

1353
01:10:10,511 --> 01:10:12,998
PSB, huh? What are those guys doing?

1354
01:10:17,772 --> 01:10:19,139
Just look at all this.

1355
01:10:19,164 --> 01:10:20,610
What's going on, here?

1356
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,111
Do you think something happened?

1357
01:10:22,403 --> 01:10:23,301
Is this..?

1358
01:10:24,375 --> 01:10:25,985
Where are you, Kudo?

1359
01:10:28,264 --> 01:10:29,321
I knew it.

1360
01:10:29,624 --> 01:10:30,798
The Ferris wheel!

1361
01:10:31,898 --> 01:10:34,126
I've brought the PSB officers.

1362
01:10:34,151 --> 01:10:36,699
What? So you mean the reservation was for them?

1363
01:10:36,928 --> 01:10:38,747
Yes, I hope that isn't a problem.

1364
01:10:39,135 --> 01:10:41,084
No, sir! It's just that I...

1365
01:10:41,282 --> 01:10:45,770
I accidentally put a group of children
on the Ferris wheel about ten minutes ago.

1366
01:10:47,248 --> 01:10:49,895
Do we wait? Should we go on after they come back down?

1367
01:10:49,935 --> 01:10:51,794
It's perfectly all right, they're only children.

1368
01:10:52,277 --> 01:10:55,779
Just relax, we've already ensured
that the Ferris wheel is secure.

1369
01:10:56,113 --> 01:11:00,459
And now it's reasonable to assume that they'll
be coming for her whenever we get back down.

1370
01:11:00,702 --> 01:11:02,445
You're gonna need to be careful out there.

1371
01:11:02,514 --> 01:11:02,928
Sir!

1372
01:11:03,473 --> 01:11:04,477
Let's get going.

1373
01:11:06,981 --> 01:11:09,258
Sorry! I gotta find my friends!

1374
01:11:10,082 --> 01:11:11,564
Excuse me! Sorry!

1375
01:11:13,331 --> 01:11:15,000
Wait! Don't get on!

1376
01:11:15,025 --> 01:11:17,895
Huh? Hang on kid! Sorry, this side's off limits.

1377
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:20,369
Ugh, I didn't make it in time.

1378
01:11:25,958 --> 01:11:27,083
Coming through!

1379
01:11:36,011 --> 01:11:37,439
If they're going to make a move...

1380
01:11:38,145 --> 01:11:41,994
It'll be right here inside the Ferris
wheel, where there's a lot less security.

1381
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:44,782
I've got to expose their plan.

1382
01:11:45,855 --> 01:11:48,031
So the PSB and FBI know.

1383
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:50,805
That's Mr. Akai!

1384
01:11:51,376 --> 01:11:54,252
Huh? Hold on... What are those cords?

1385
01:11:55,286 --> 01:11:57,462
Okay, now if I'm right...

1386
01:11:58,010 --> 01:12:00,283
I've gotta confirm this ASAP.

1387
01:12:03,111 --> 01:12:05,263
There she is. On schedule.

1388
01:12:06,687 --> 01:12:08,513
Confirming Curaçao is on the gondola.

1389
01:12:08,601 --> 01:12:10,721
And she's being accompanied by a PSB.

1390
01:12:10,816 --> 01:12:13,509
It should take them about ten minutes to get to the top.

1391
01:12:14,081 --> 01:12:16,552
Ten minutes, huh? Well, Vodka?

1392
01:12:16,910 --> 01:12:18,030
I'm ready anytime.

1393
01:12:19,078 --> 01:12:20,802
What about the other officers?

1394
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:24,114
There are a few of them who are
keeping watch over every station.

1395
01:12:24,512 --> 01:12:25,924
Shouldn't slow us down though.

1396
01:12:26,474 --> 01:12:29,548
Hmph. Then we'll be waiting for your signal.

1397
01:12:29,749 --> 01:12:30,876
Right, copy that.

1398
01:12:31,659 --> 01:12:35,423
You're joking. You're saying you don't remember me?

1399
01:12:37,128 --> 01:12:42,650
Hm. Well that's a pity isn't it? Once you
get your memory back, I plan on torturing you.

1400
01:12:42,991 --> 01:12:44,819
You'll tell me where the NOC List is,

1401
01:12:44,874 --> 01:12:47,717
along with everything you know about the Organization.

1402
01:12:48,218 --> 01:12:48,742
Hup..!

1403
01:12:51,797 --> 01:12:54,119
I thought I got here before anybody else, but...

1404
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:01,125
Huh.

1405
01:13:03,176 --> 01:13:04,313
There he is...

1406
01:13:09,669 --> 01:13:12,418
Hmph. It seems like you managed to make it out safely.

1407
01:13:12,882 --> 01:13:16,302
If he's here, then that must mean my hunch was right.

1408
01:13:18,892 --> 01:13:19,463
Huh?

1409
01:13:23,111 --> 01:13:24,501
Wait? What happened?

1410
01:13:24,581 --> 01:13:25,038
The lights!

1411
01:13:25,063 --> 01:13:28,970
You wanted to blind them. That's
why you turned out the lights.

1412
01:13:29,026 --> 01:13:34,596
Because you realized that I was
still trapped in the warehouse.

1413
01:13:35,469 --> 01:13:37,597
You swung the doors wide open.

1414
01:13:38,263 --> 01:13:41,503
You wanted to make it look like I'd already fled outside.

1415
01:13:42,035 --> 01:13:43,284
Apologies Kir...

1416
01:13:43,397 --> 01:13:45,739
Thanks to you, I was able to hide.

1417
01:13:46,411 --> 01:13:49,738
And figure out just what they were planning to do next.

1418
01:13:52,285 --> 01:13:56,632
I figured that if you were the one
who did all that for me, you'd come here.

1419
01:13:57,100 --> 01:14:00,627
So tell me something. Why did you save us?

1420
01:14:01,419 --> 01:14:06,492
I'm sure you could've gotten information
on them without endangering yourself, right?

1421
01:14:07,111 --> 01:14:10,711
That's why you came all the way
up here? For a little conversation?

1422
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:14,778
Yeah, I wanted to tell the FBI that they could pull out.

1423
01:14:15,254 --> 01:14:18,480
And let them know that the PSB, will take Curaçao with us.

1424
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:20,935
What if I refuse, and say no?

1425
01:14:21,514 --> 01:14:24,072
Well, if you were to do that, we'd take her by force.

1426
01:14:24,097 --> 01:14:24,518
Hmph.

1427
01:14:25,273 --> 01:14:27,552
Get out of here! Now!!

1428
01:14:29,790 --> 01:14:30,285
Hm.

1429
01:14:37,601 --> 01:14:40,536
There shouldn't be all those
cords running to the sprinklers.

1430
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:44,554
Something's wrong. But I can't risk opening it.

1431
01:14:45,307 --> 01:14:46,232
Unless?

1432
01:14:50,664 --> 01:14:52,174
Is that a detonator?

1433
01:14:52,689 --> 01:14:53,627
That means...

1434
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:58,060
There can only be one thing at the end of those cords.

1435
01:14:58,887 --> 01:15:00,254
Explosives.

1436
01:15:00,634 --> 01:15:04,456
What do I do now? If that's a remote controlled detonator,

1437
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:07,845
they'll blow this place sky-high
at the first sign of trouble!

1438
01:15:08,723 --> 01:15:09,621
I get it!

1439
01:15:10,271 --> 01:15:11,240
He's here!

1440
01:15:14,493 --> 01:15:17,070
Thank you so much for your patience everyone...

1441
01:15:17,273 --> 01:15:20,268
Why isn't anyone on the Ferris wheel?

1442
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:21,403
Don't tell me!

1443
01:15:23,048 --> 01:15:24,389
Why are they there?!

1444
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:29,433
Ugh!

1445
01:15:36,590 --> 01:15:37,498
Hah!

1446
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:45,426
I told you already, Amuro.

1447
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,614
When you pick your prey, choose carefully.

1448
01:15:48,685 --> 01:15:50,927
I know. And after I take you down,

1449
01:15:50,965 --> 01:15:53,339
I'm going after the entire Organization!

1450
01:15:56,424 --> 01:15:57,895
Hup! Ugh!

1451
01:15:59,385 --> 01:16:00,017
Gah!

1452
01:16:01,218 --> 01:16:01,843
Ugh!

1453
01:16:13,029 --> 01:16:16,025
What will you do if Curaçao's memory comes back,

1454
01:16:16,223 --> 01:16:18,200
and they attack while we're fighting up here?

1455
01:16:18,519 --> 01:16:20,236
Why can't you just say it?

1456
01:16:20,386 --> 01:16:23,937
That don't trust the Japanese police
who got their information stolen!

1457
01:16:26,606 --> 01:16:29,052
Damn. Where'd Mr. Akai go?

1458
01:16:29,951 --> 01:16:31,827
Come on, pick up the phone!

1459
01:16:32,946 --> 01:16:33,406
Huh?

1460
01:16:34,651 --> 01:16:35,325
Huh?

1461
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:35,790
Ugh!

1462
01:16:40,185 --> 01:16:40,868
Ugh...

1463
01:16:44,117 --> 01:16:46,160
Hm? Maybe he's up there...

1464
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:48,797
Where'd he go?

1465
01:16:50,330 --> 01:16:50,738
Huh?

1466
01:16:50,777 --> 01:16:51,196
Hah!

1467
01:16:51,363 --> 01:16:52,197
Gah!

1468
01:16:59,235 --> 01:17:00,308
Ugh!

1469
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:05,801
Gah!

1470
01:17:08,556 --> 01:17:09,199
Enough!

1471
01:17:10,113 --> 01:17:11,058
Ugh!

1472
01:17:12,351 --> 01:17:13,440
Done already?

1473
01:17:16,261 --> 01:17:18,551
Cause I'm just gearing up for the second round!

1474
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:21,856
Mr. Akai! Where are you?

1475
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:24,684
We've got trouble! I need your help!

1476
01:17:25,382 --> 01:17:29,260
If those guys don't get Curaçao back,
they're gonna blow this whole place up!

1477
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:30,842
Ferris wheel and all!

1478
01:17:31,158 --> 01:17:33,750
Please! If you're there, help me!

1479
01:17:33,944 --> 01:17:37,355
We need to disarm the bombs
before they launch their attack!

1480
01:17:37,657 --> 01:17:38,579
Or we're doomed!

1481
01:17:38,675 --> 01:17:39,619
Is that true?

1482
01:17:40,150 --> 01:17:42,150
How did you get here, Mr. Amuro?!

1483
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:45,265
I'll explain later! Now where are the explosives?

1484
01:17:45,372 --> 01:17:48,248
There's a ton of them are wired
between the axle and the wheel!

1485
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:51,378
They're remote controlled, so
they could blow at any minute!

1486
01:17:51,521 --> 01:17:53,308
We've gotta disarm them now!

1487
01:17:53,689 --> 01:17:54,150
Hm.

1488
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:58,901
Okay. I'll bring the FBI with me.

1489
01:18:00,738 --> 01:18:01,206
Em!

1490
01:18:02,269 --> 01:18:04,427
Wow. It was so beautiful, wasn't it?

1491
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:05,140
I guess so.

1492
01:18:06,688 --> 01:18:10,542
There's no need to act all depressed.
I am so gonna find him for you.

1493
01:18:10,875 --> 01:18:12,837
Ah... No, that's not it.

1494
01:18:12,925 --> 01:18:16,333
If he's busy investigating something,
then I don't wanna bother him.

1495
01:18:16,905 --> 01:18:19,890
Has anybody ever told you that you're way too naive?

1496
01:18:20,218 --> 01:18:23,660
Listen up! We are gonna catch
him in the act, you understand me?

1497
01:18:23,685 --> 01:18:25,217
Just forget it, Sonoko.

1498
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:25,696
Hmph!

1499
01:18:25,855 --> 01:18:29,482
Not a chance! Cause we haven't even
checked the most important spot yet.

1500
01:18:29,744 --> 01:18:31,309
The most important spot?

1501
01:18:31,666 --> 01:18:33,780
Yup! It's right over there!

1502
01:18:35,512 --> 01:18:36,711
The aquarium?

1503
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:37,742
Exactly!

1504
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:43,878
How's it coming?

1505
01:18:44,439 --> 01:18:45,505
Almost there.

1506
01:18:50,543 --> 01:18:52,259
That should just about do it.

1507
01:18:53,499 --> 01:18:55,739
The detonator was booby trapped wasn't it?

1508
01:18:56,143 --> 01:18:59,679
Correct. Good think you were careful,
or that would have been a disaster.

1509
01:19:00,505 --> 01:19:01,020
Huh?

1510
01:19:01,372 --> 01:19:02,913
Did you find the explosives?

1511
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:06,576
Yeah, they were hidden well. It's C-4 just as I thought.

1512
01:19:07,068 --> 01:19:10,294
If it all goes off at once, the
axle won't be able to take the load.

1513
01:19:10,690 --> 01:19:13,343
When that happens the whole thing will come crashing down.

1514
01:19:14,338 --> 01:19:17,261
I see... There's no time to waste then.

1515
01:19:19,196 --> 01:19:20,045
Is this it?

1516
01:19:20,402 --> 01:19:22,731
How's it look? You think you can disarm it?

1517
01:19:22,855 --> 01:19:25,407
It's fairly common, so yeah.

1518
01:19:25,930 --> 01:19:27,381
This ought to be pretty easy.

1519
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:30,360
That's awesome! You sure do know your explosives.

1520
01:19:30,856 --> 01:19:34,153
A friend of mine at the police
academy taught me everything he know.

1521
01:19:35,489 --> 01:19:38,951
Later he went on to become the
best officer in the bomb squad.

1522
01:19:39,874 --> 01:19:44,540
Now that I think about it, he actually
died trying to disarm a bomb on a Ferris wheel.

1523
01:19:45,450 --> 01:19:47,872
So it was exactly what you are doing here?

1524
01:19:48,058 --> 01:19:49,328
Yeah, but don't worry!

1525
01:19:49,397 --> 01:19:53,589
Cause his technique was almost perfect.
Just give me a second here and I can show you.

1526
01:19:53,754 --> 01:19:54,485
Use this!

1527
01:19:54,773 --> 01:19:55,255
Huh?

1528
01:19:57,118 --> 01:20:00,609
Just take what ever tools you might
need and get that thing disarmed.

1529
01:20:01,025 --> 01:20:02,088
What about you?

1530
01:20:02,382 --> 01:20:04,430
The fact that there are bombs hidden around here,

1531
01:20:04,455 --> 01:20:07,155
proves they're gonna bring down
the Ferris wheel no matter what.

1532
01:20:07,776 --> 01:20:14,100
And if we wanna get at Curaçao without being caught in
the blast... Well, there's only one way I can think of.

1533
01:20:14,315 --> 01:20:15,667
Yeah! From the sky!

1534
01:20:16,322 --> 01:20:19,980
That's right. I'll go back to
where I was and try to buy some time.

1535
01:20:20,465 --> 01:20:22,817
Disarm them, no matter what takes.

1536
01:20:22,889 --> 01:20:25,900
Hmph. Well that's a lot easier said than done.

1537
01:20:26,024 --> 01:20:27,162
Here, Mr. Amuro.

1538
01:20:28,251 --> 01:20:31,318
I appreciate it. Now it's time to get to work.

1539
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:33,677
Just hope he can stall them long enough.

1540
01:20:34,258 --> 01:20:37,309
Me too... If we don't know when they'll go off...

1541
01:20:38,015 --> 01:20:41,250
No, hold on! They're going to launch their attack.

1542
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:41,953
Ugh!

1543
01:20:43,522 --> 01:20:44,801
What's the matter, Conan?

1544
01:20:44,826 --> 01:20:46,650
I've gotta save the NOC list!

1545
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,486
What the hell is wrong with all you people?

1546
01:20:59,346 --> 01:21:04,465
These spotlights are the same five
colors as the filters Curaçao had on her!

1547
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:08,476
And at night, the transparency's almost identical!

1548
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:10,732
If I'm right.

1549
01:21:10,874 --> 01:21:15,158
When she sees this combination of
colors, she's gonna remember everything!

1550
01:21:16,231 --> 01:21:18,995
That's where the NOC list is... In her brain!

1551
01:21:19,559 --> 01:21:23,491
And when the gondola reaches the
top, her memory will be restored!

1552
01:21:23,745 --> 01:21:25,135
That's when it'll happen!

1553
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:28,450
When she sees these exact colors,

1554
01:21:28,592 --> 01:21:30,992
everything is going to come flooding back!

1555
01:21:31,819 --> 01:21:32,753
Finally.

1556
01:21:38,294 --> 01:21:39,875
All right, it's almost go time.

1557
01:21:39,995 --> 01:21:42,100
So we'll be starting up in just three minutes.

1558
01:21:42,203 --> 01:21:45,540
Every one of the preparations have been made.

1559
01:21:46,313 --> 01:21:47,242
Now Chianti!

1560
01:21:47,368 --> 01:21:51,953
Hold position at point alpha. Radio silence, understand?

1561
01:21:52,078 --> 01:21:52,612
Roger!

1562
01:21:57,414 --> 01:22:00,999
I've got to disarm them, and then go meet up with Kazami.

1563
01:22:02,346 --> 01:22:04,081
The next step is...

1564
01:22:06,394 --> 01:22:07,021
Oh, no!

1565
01:22:08,498 --> 01:22:10,063
Man, that was a close one.

1566
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:13,845
Hope this doesn't flash.

1567
01:22:15,086 --> 01:22:19,043
Rushing is the greatest trap
that there is. Right, Matsuda?

1568
01:22:19,804 --> 01:22:22,737
What on earth's going on? We're almost half way up!

1569
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:26,140
If it wasn't those fireworks that went off a while ago...

1570
01:22:26,256 --> 01:22:29,026
Could Mr. Furuya's information have been wrong?

1571
01:22:42,275 --> 01:22:44,152
Hey, what's the matter?

1572
01:22:45,972 --> 01:22:47,687
Cut it out! Calm down!

1573
01:22:53,488 --> 01:22:55,942
Huh? What's going on?

1574
01:22:56,276 --> 01:22:58,127
She should have gotten her memory back!

1575
01:22:58,745 --> 01:23:01,274
Don't tell me the mail that Rum received was...

1576
01:23:01,773 --> 01:23:03,775
Stop! Sit down!

1577
01:23:03,846 --> 01:23:05,834
Hey! Knock it off!

1578
01:23:14,162 --> 01:23:16,799
You know this is all your fault, Curaçao.

1579
01:23:17,243 --> 01:23:22,114
You memorized facts about the Organization
with that special brain of yours, didn't you?

1580
01:23:23,124 --> 01:23:25,117
You're talented, I'll give you that.

1581
01:23:25,808 --> 01:23:30,147
Talent, when used the wrong way,
can still become a major liability.

1582
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:32,815
Do you understand?

1583
01:23:33,182 --> 01:23:36,812
This is your destiny, and it always has been.

1584
01:23:38,448 --> 01:23:41,032
Say good-bye, Curaçao.

1585
01:23:42,985 --> 01:23:43,605
Wait.

1586
01:23:44,281 --> 01:23:45,971
No... Could that be?

1587
01:23:48,897 --> 01:23:51,836
W-What in the hell are you doing here?

1588
01:23:51,884 --> 01:23:53,139
Back off, Vermouth.

1589
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:54,075
Huh...

1590
01:24:02,498 --> 01:24:05,199
Curaçao, you have no color.

1591
01:24:05,842 --> 01:24:07,893
Only pitch black darkness.

1592
01:24:08,562 --> 01:24:10,095
Is... That Rum?

1593
01:24:10,714 --> 01:24:12,780
If that darkness is torturing you,

1594
01:24:13,288 --> 01:24:15,488
you need only turn another color.

1595
01:24:16,369 --> 01:24:19,684
Use your special ability for me, and me alone.

1596
01:24:20,811 --> 01:24:23,282
Input, and output.

1597
01:24:23,917 --> 01:24:28,619
Soon, you will become my right hand, Curaçao.

1598
01:24:31,484 --> 01:24:33,696
Hey, get a hold of yourself.

1599
01:24:34,379 --> 01:24:35,411
Seriously.

1600
01:24:35,969 --> 01:24:38,280
Get a grip, and I'll have an ambulance come out here.

1601
01:24:39,263 --> 01:24:40,164
No need.

1602
01:24:40,189 --> 01:24:40,846
Huh?!

1603
01:24:48,510 --> 01:24:51,319
Hmph. So, you did regain your memory.

1604
01:24:52,556 --> 01:24:55,179
Seems Curaçao has just entered the capture area.

1605
01:24:56,768 --> 01:24:58,541
Only two more minutes to the top.

1606
01:24:59,328 --> 01:25:01,106
I guess it's time we got started?

1607
01:25:02,621 --> 01:25:04,151
Vodka. Get the arm out.

1608
01:25:04,318 --> 01:25:04,913
Yes, sir!

1609
01:25:07,272 --> 01:25:08,273
Opening hatch.

1610
01:25:24,164 --> 01:25:27,286
That's a propeller... They must be close by.

1611
01:25:35,017 --> 01:25:38,488
What the hell? They're planning something, but what is it?

1612
01:25:48,935 --> 01:25:49,387
Huh?

1613
01:25:49,935 --> 01:25:50,689
No way...

1614
01:25:53,295 --> 01:25:53,964
Who is it?

1615
01:25:54,577 --> 01:25:56,134
Long time no see, Vermouth.

1616
01:25:56,350 --> 01:25:59,420
Hm, so it appears you're back to your old self, huh?

1617
01:25:59,756 --> 01:26:02,745
I am, now when can I expect
them to come out here and get me?

1618
01:26:03,094 --> 01:26:05,543
There are tons of PSB officers outside.

1619
01:26:05,972 --> 01:26:08,712
Don't worry. Gin will be coming for you soon.

1620
01:26:09,392 --> 01:26:10,066
Really?

1621
01:26:10,312 --> 01:26:13,798
That's right. By the way, when
did you get your memory back?

1622
01:26:14,227 --> 01:26:16,830
Rum told me he received a message from your phone.

1623
01:26:17,586 --> 01:26:20,620
If you're not the one who actually sent it, then...

1624
01:26:22,519 --> 01:26:25,516
I remember, of course I'm the one who sent it out.

1625
01:26:25,953 --> 01:26:27,224
There some kind of problem?

1626
01:26:27,415 --> 01:26:28,161
Guess not.

1627
01:26:28,756 --> 01:26:31,149
So Kir and Bourbon really are innocent.

1628
01:26:31,442 --> 01:26:34,621
They only ran because they didn't
want to die over a false accusation...

1629
01:26:34,930 --> 01:26:35,319
Huh.

1630
01:26:35,875 --> 01:26:37,845
It's almost time, Cinderella.

1631
01:26:38,130 --> 01:26:40,492
Your pumpkin coach will be arriving shortly.

1632
01:26:41,063 --> 01:26:41,540
Got it.

1633
01:26:42,605 --> 01:26:43,597
In four.

1634
01:26:43,938 --> 01:26:47,664
Three, two, one, zero.

1635
01:26:58,318 --> 01:26:58,850
Hmph.

1636
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:01,780
What the?

1637
01:27:02,195 --> 01:27:02,647
Tsk.

1638
01:27:03,204 --> 01:27:04,732
Damn it, they've started!

1639
01:27:05,515 --> 01:27:07,039
I confirmed Vermouth's signal.

1640
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:09,162
The entire place has gone dark!

1641
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:12,590
Alright. Now take us down immediately.

1642
01:27:12,912 --> 01:27:14,205
Curaçao's waiting.

1643
01:27:14,723 --> 01:27:15,510
Can do!

1644
01:27:18,123 --> 01:27:19,884
Please remain calm, everyone!

1645
01:27:19,909 --> 01:27:20,905
Just stay where you are...

1646
01:27:20,930 --> 01:27:22,745
The lights will turn on soon!

1647
01:27:22,991 --> 01:27:24,223
Hey, check it out!

1648
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:26,964
It looks like the aquarium lights are back on now!

1649
01:27:27,170 --> 01:27:28,171
Let's go there.

1650
01:27:28,258 --> 01:27:29,974
Okay. Hey, follow us everyone!

1651
01:27:29,999 --> 01:27:32,603
No! It's too dangerous, please stay in here!

1652
01:27:37,924 --> 01:27:38,354
Huh?

1653
01:27:41,669 --> 01:27:45,235
I've got a bad feeling about this.
I have to get the kids out of here!

1654
01:27:45,766 --> 01:27:48,315
Come on! A blackout, here?

1655
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:49,960
Talk about unlucky.

1656
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:51,900
We were almost ready to get off.

1657
01:27:52,171 --> 01:27:52,830
What's up?

1658
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:54,395
I'm not getting a signal.

1659
01:27:54,730 --> 01:27:56,682
What could Mr. Kazami be doing?

1660
01:27:58,193 --> 01:27:59,774
Hey, Sato, Takagi.

1661
01:28:00,355 --> 01:28:04,407
It sounds like the officers at the
PSB aren't aware of the situation yet.

1662
01:28:04,522 --> 01:28:05,164
I thought so.

1663
01:28:05,219 --> 01:28:06,561
Well, now what?

1664
01:28:07,038 --> 01:28:08,950
We ask them to work along with us.

1665
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:10,610
Wait, you've gotta be kidding me.

1666
01:28:10,635 --> 01:28:13,220
This isn't a time for political bickering.

1667
01:28:13,964 --> 01:28:14,925
Understood?

1668
01:28:15,205 --> 01:28:15,913
Sir!

1669
01:28:16,506 --> 01:28:18,438
It doesn't look like he's here either.

1670
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:23,372
Sorry, Sonoko. I guess I was
totally mistaken about this, huh?

1671
01:28:23,485 --> 01:28:26,334
Hey, there's something outside! Let's go check it out!

1672
01:28:28,909 --> 01:28:29,888
Excuse us!

1673
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:31,086
Yeah, let us through!

1674
01:28:32,070 --> 01:28:32,835
This is...

1675
01:28:32,939 --> 01:28:34,184
What's happening?

1676
01:28:34,613 --> 01:28:37,990
Argh... I can't tell which cord is which in the dark.

1677
01:28:38,492 --> 01:28:40,869
I'm almost finished disarming it, but now...

1678
01:28:41,130 --> 01:28:43,011
I can't see anything at all!

1679
01:28:51,703 --> 01:28:55,387
If I stay here I'll be taken
back to the Organization, huh?

1680
01:29:01,953 --> 01:29:04,365
Oh no, they're taking her cart too!

1681
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,631
Huh?! Could that be?

1682
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:14,733
We're looking good! Target in range!

1683
01:29:15,378 --> 01:29:16,790
Let's do this thing!

1684
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:23,641
Wait, that's a PSB agent!

1685
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:26,253
That means it was Curaçao who jumped out!

1686
01:29:26,956 --> 01:29:27,828
Time to go!

1687
01:29:30,552 --> 01:29:32,863
Hey, wake up! We gotta go!

1688
01:29:35,408 --> 01:29:39,052
Hm. I'm gonna need more than this rifle to take it down.

1689
01:29:39,459 --> 01:29:41,985
But there should be a weak point somewhere.

1690
01:29:43,033 --> 01:29:43,852
Ugh.

1691
01:29:48,754 --> 01:29:49,954
Ugh!

1692
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:54,839
Woah! Ugh!

1693
01:30:01,450 --> 01:30:03,046
I'm too far away..!

1694
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,217
Right. Now get going.

1695
01:30:05,598 --> 01:30:06,233
Yes, sir!

1696
01:30:06,457 --> 01:30:07,259
8 O' clock.

1697
01:30:07,916 --> 01:30:10,730
On top of the target. Just saw something move.

1698
01:30:11,032 --> 01:30:12,640
Did the PSB agent escape?

1699
01:30:13,088 --> 01:30:14,615
Use the thermal sensor!

1700
01:30:14,759 --> 01:30:15,201
Right!

1701
01:30:17,352 --> 01:30:19,373
Wait is that a man?

1702
01:30:19,670 --> 01:30:21,860
And it looks like there's a kid in there too!

1703
01:30:22,043 --> 01:30:24,181
Curaçao's not on the Ferris wheel, boss!

1704
01:30:24,237 --> 01:30:24,913
She's not?!

1705
01:30:26,097 --> 01:30:27,446
Curaçao!

1706
01:30:27,748 --> 01:30:28,948
Lose the gondola.

1707
01:30:29,035 --> 01:30:29,899
Y-Yes sir!

1708
01:30:31,510 --> 01:30:34,111
Hey! Are you kidding me?!

1709
01:30:34,230 --> 01:30:34,825
Woah!

1710
01:30:38,742 --> 01:30:39,379
Ugh!

1711
01:30:42,359 --> 01:30:43,098
Take cover!

1712
01:30:43,194 --> 01:30:44,886
The park is under attack!

1713
01:30:47,364 --> 01:30:48,833
Gin! What's going on?

1714
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:50,382
Curaçao's gone.

1715
01:30:50,747 --> 01:30:51,343
Huh?!

1716
01:30:51,647 --> 01:30:53,852
Change of plans. Get rid of her.

1717
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:55,412
But what's the hurry?

1718
01:30:55,704 --> 01:30:57,254
We're not sure she betrayed us.

1719
01:30:57,524 --> 01:31:01,608
And yet she fled the gondola.
That's all the proof I'm gonna need.

1720
01:31:02,149 --> 01:31:03,293
Find her location.

1721
01:31:03,318 --> 01:31:04,334
Uh, yes sir.

1722
01:31:04,548 --> 01:31:06,805
Chianti! Steer us clear.

1723
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:07,726
No problem!

1724
01:31:07,785 --> 01:31:10,070
Korn! Ready the IDWS.

1725
01:31:10,356 --> 01:31:11,181
You got it.

1726
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:18,411
Huh?

1727
01:31:25,578 --> 01:31:27,349
Huh? It can't be!

1728
01:31:29,121 --> 01:31:29,803
Ah!

1729
01:31:33,322 --> 01:31:34,006
Ah!

1730
01:31:37,072 --> 01:31:40,418
Now what? Are you planning to take me back to your bosses?

1731
01:31:40,768 --> 01:31:43,183
Wait, do you mean the Organization?

1732
01:31:43,426 --> 01:31:45,439
So her memory is back...

1733
01:31:46,344 --> 01:31:49,379
Are you Sherry, the one who betrayed them?

1734
01:31:51,545 --> 01:31:52,940
Come on, we're leaving.

1735
01:31:53,599 --> 01:31:54,822
It's too dangerous.

1736
01:31:54,868 --> 01:31:56,498
Wait, what do you mean we're leaving?

1737
01:31:56,641 --> 01:31:58,500
It's no time to be joking around!

1738
01:31:58,525 --> 01:31:59,422
Gin is here. -

1739
01:31:59,948 --> 01:32:02,514
Of all people, you know what that means, right?

1740
01:32:02,623 --> 01:32:04,682
But... Why would you rescue me?

1741
01:32:05,184 --> 01:32:08,780
I don't know. I don't know why I'm choosing to do this.

1742
01:32:09,831 --> 01:32:13,065
But I'm Curaçao. I can bey color.

1743
01:32:13,731 --> 01:32:16,593
And I feel better right now than I ever did before.

1744
01:32:17,855 --> 01:32:19,648
So that's the reason why!

1745
01:32:21,573 --> 01:32:22,060
Ah...

1746
01:32:22,718 --> 01:32:24,728
Come on now Sherry, let's go.

1747
01:32:25,412 --> 01:32:25,912
Wait!

1748
01:32:26,048 --> 01:32:26,405
Hm?

1749
01:32:26,897 --> 01:32:28,646
The children are still in the gondola!

1750
01:32:29,051 --> 01:32:30,409
We've gotta go save them!

1751
01:32:34,261 --> 01:32:36,710
There's no time to worry about what happened.

1752
01:32:37,575 --> 01:32:40,216
At least I can see the wiring and the blasting cap.

1753
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:43,625
Just concentrate. Work as fast as you can.

1754
01:32:44,027 --> 01:32:45,440
But don't rush it...

1755
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:47,092
Huh?

1756
01:32:47,759 --> 01:32:48,308
Sir!

1757
01:32:50,144 --> 01:32:51,550
Get a hold of yourself!

1758
01:32:51,649 --> 01:32:52,383
Ugh...

1759
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:54,950
Not good!

1760
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:00,598
Well?

1761
01:33:01,123 --> 01:33:02,911
Haven't you found Curaçao yet?

1762
01:33:03,641 --> 01:33:05,581
There's movement inside the Ferris wheel.

1763
01:33:06,215 --> 01:33:07,811
Two kids, and one adult..

1764
01:33:08,351 --> 01:33:10,255
You've gotta be kidding... Boss.

1765
01:33:11,032 --> 01:33:12,668
There's somebody by the detonator!

1766
01:33:12,950 --> 01:33:13,501
What?!

1767
01:33:13,830 --> 01:33:14,711
Over here!

1768
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:18,168
We set it up down inside the sprinkler box, didn't we?

1769
01:33:20,026 --> 01:33:21,821
The PSB found it.

1770
01:33:22,705 --> 01:33:25,412
I just need to cut the cords to the blasting cap.

1771
01:33:29,317 --> 01:33:31,473
Now, only one more cut!

1772
01:33:35,165 --> 01:33:35,754
Huh...

1773
01:33:39,396 --> 01:33:40,204
Okay..!

1774
01:33:42,654 --> 01:33:44,324
Just in the nick of time.

1775
01:33:49,467 --> 01:33:49,840
Hmph.

1776
01:33:52,398 --> 01:33:52,788
Huh...

1777
01:33:53,177 --> 01:33:53,574
Hm...

1778
01:33:54,846 --> 01:33:58,405
You know what to do. Shower them all with bullets!

1779
01:34:00,936 --> 01:34:04,300
Now get rid of them, Korn! Just mow them all down!

1780
01:34:04,545 --> 01:34:05,335
On it.

1781
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:14,463
Wh-What is going on here?!

1782
01:34:14,597 --> 01:34:15,827
Ugh! Huh?!

1783
01:34:17,251 --> 01:34:19,048
I've got to do something!

1784
01:34:21,915 --> 01:34:22,462
Ugh!

1785
01:34:23,846 --> 01:34:25,338
I'd better get a move on!

1786
01:34:26,730 --> 01:34:28,782
I can't do it from above...

1787
01:34:31,131 --> 01:34:33,147
No good, it isn't working...

1788
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:36,230
With all these people, the
cell tower's getting overloaded.

1789
01:34:36,963 --> 01:34:38,997
I just hope everybody's okay.

1790
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:40,896
Hurry! Jump!

1791
01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:43,144
Now run!

1792
01:34:46,125 --> 01:34:46,807
Ugh!

1793
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:49,968
Hm..! Tsk!

1794
01:34:58,891 --> 01:35:02,720
If I move they'll see me. I can't do anything like this!

1795
01:35:05,895 --> 01:35:06,723
They're coming.

1796
01:35:07,627 --> 01:35:10,065
Hold on! What are you planning?

1797
01:35:10,090 --> 01:35:12,057
You need to take care of them, okay?

1798
01:35:12,293 --> 01:35:13,993
But they're going to kill you!

1799
01:35:18,563 --> 01:35:20,884
Huh? I've seen moves like that before!

1800
01:35:21,025 --> 01:35:22,471
It's Curaçao!

1801
01:35:26,780 --> 01:35:29,765
Huh? They focused their attacks on one spot.

1802
01:35:30,817 --> 01:35:31,981
They found her!

1803
01:35:32,409 --> 01:35:33,370
Gotta move!

1804
01:35:37,703 --> 01:35:39,163
Die, Curaçao!

1805
01:35:41,385 --> 01:35:41,825
Huh?!

1806
01:36:02,437 --> 01:36:03,422
Oh, no..!

1807
01:36:04,391 --> 01:36:05,145
Ugh..!

1808
01:36:06,503 --> 01:36:07,703
No sign of Curaçao.

1809
01:36:08,729 --> 01:36:10,032
Mission accomplished.

1810
01:36:10,222 --> 01:36:11,969
No, not yet.

1811
01:36:12,771 --> 01:36:14,932
We've still gotta get rid of the rats.

1812
01:36:15,568 --> 01:36:17,100
Hit the bomb by the axle.

1813
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:19,440
Wait, are you sure about that boss?

1814
01:36:19,812 --> 01:36:20,510
Yeah.

1815
01:36:21,113 --> 01:36:26,629
Knowing Curaçao she's still gonna find a
way to escape. Nothing we can do about it now.

1816
01:36:27,439 --> 01:36:29,925
But the PSB on the other hand.

1817
01:36:30,135 --> 01:36:33,749
Korn! You need to reload the guns and blow up the axle!

1818
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:36,110
We don't have much time left out here.

1819
01:36:36,338 --> 01:36:38,090
The axel. Got it.

1820
01:36:40,341 --> 01:36:41,360
Haibara!

1821
01:36:43,187 --> 01:36:43,942
Are you all alright?

1822
01:36:43,967 --> 01:36:45,260
Yeah, we're fine...

1823
01:36:45,260 --> 01:36:48,000
Hey, Ai... Do you know what's going on?

1824
01:36:48,230 --> 01:36:50,153
I'll explain everything a little later.

1825
01:36:50,423 --> 01:36:51,559
Just stay put for now.

1826
01:36:51,830 --> 01:36:52,584
Right.

1827
01:36:53,285 --> 01:36:54,540
Mr. Akai!

1828
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,080
Amuro!

1829
01:36:56,312 --> 01:36:56,542
Hey!

1830
01:36:56,567 --> 01:36:57,145
This way!

1831
01:36:58,530 --> 01:36:59,551
Mr. Akai!

1832
01:37:01,977 --> 01:37:03,160
You are all right, kiddo?

1833
01:37:04,508 --> 01:37:07,811
Just take cover, cause I still
hear their propeller out there.

1834
01:37:08,836 --> 01:37:09,937
Where's Amuro?

1835
01:37:10,286 --> 01:37:11,469
I have no idea.

1836
01:37:11,563 --> 01:37:15,055
If they're shooting at us, then it
must mean that he disarmed the explosives.

1837
01:37:15,165 --> 01:37:17,011
Otherwise, we'd both be dead by now.

1838
01:37:17,662 --> 01:37:19,604
So all that's left is them.

1839
01:37:19,698 --> 01:37:21,489
Is that gun just for show?

1840
01:37:23,368 --> 01:37:24,480
Mr. Amuro!

1841
01:37:24,584 --> 01:37:28,151
Isn't there a way we can hit them back? FBI boy?

1842
01:37:28,335 --> 01:37:32,480
Well unfortunately, the night scope
that's attached to my rifle's busted.

1843
01:37:32,808 --> 01:37:36,415
The only thing I have now is this
regular one that I use as a back up.

1844
01:37:37,001 --> 01:37:40,283
There's no way it'll bring down
an aircraft on a dark night though.

1845
01:37:40,871 --> 01:37:42,550
What if you were able to see it?

1846
01:37:42,658 --> 01:37:43,269
Then yeah.

1847
01:37:43,630 --> 01:37:44,765
Are you positive?

1848
01:37:44,826 --> 01:37:47,114
If I hit the part where the propeller attaches.

1849
01:37:47,832 --> 01:37:49,332
I didn't see that part?

1850
01:37:49,818 --> 01:37:51,530
It's only visible from the front.

1851
01:37:52,685 --> 01:37:58,183
If you can throw it off balance and get some light on
the propeller, then I shod be able to handle the rest.

1852
01:37:58,810 --> 01:38:03,864
I think I can do that. But first I'm gonna
need to know what shape it is so I can find it.

1853
01:38:11,695 --> 01:38:14,072
It's the axel! They're aiming for the bomb on it!

1854
01:38:14,374 --> 01:38:17,050
Sounds like they're trying to
bring down the whole Ferris wheel.

1855
01:38:18,607 --> 01:38:19,457
Damn it.

1856
01:38:19,664 --> 01:38:22,460
Half of the explosives are still attached to the axle!

1857
01:38:24,401 --> 01:38:25,831
Light em up! Go!

1858
01:38:26,355 --> 01:38:26,751
Hm.

1859
01:38:27,545 --> 01:38:32,219
I see where they're firing from,
but not where the propeller is!

1860
01:38:32,437 --> 01:38:34,673
You just need the general direction, right?

1861
01:38:35,962 --> 01:38:36,652
Okay!

1862
01:38:38,971 --> 01:38:40,323
Watch carefully!

1863
01:38:48,066 --> 01:38:48,567
Huh?!

1864
01:38:49,213 --> 01:38:50,197
I see it!

1865
01:38:56,367 --> 01:38:58,681
Let's go!!

1866
01:39:05,105 --> 01:39:05,663
Huh?!

1867
01:39:13,506 --> 01:39:14,462
Ugh!

1868
01:39:16,385 --> 01:39:17,259
That light is...

1869
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:18,210
Look up there!

1870
01:39:18,332 --> 01:39:18,845
Huh?!

1871
01:39:19,128 --> 01:39:20,351
What is that?!

1872
01:39:20,597 --> 01:39:21,578
Fireworks?

1873
01:39:21,603 --> 01:39:22,949
We're being attacked!

1874
01:39:22,991 --> 01:39:24,705
But where is it coming from?

1875
01:39:27,948 --> 01:39:29,266
Say good-bye!

1876
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:38,328
We got them!

1877
01:39:38,353 --> 01:39:39,299
Yeah!

1878
01:39:39,681 --> 01:39:40,536
Hah.

1879
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:50,210
This is really bad! We're about to crash everybody

1880
01:39:50,210 --> 01:39:51,580
Korn, move! Get going!

1881
01:39:55,826 --> 01:39:56,504
Argh!

1882
01:39:59,382 --> 01:40:01,560
Please, just let the axel hold!

1883
01:40:03,701 --> 01:40:04,261
Huh?

1884
01:40:15,508 --> 01:40:16,566
Woah!

1885
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:19,567
Hmph! Woah!

1886
01:40:40,531 --> 01:40:42,949
Ugh! We're going down! We should bail!

1887
01:40:46,085 --> 01:40:47,858
Hurry! Run!!

1888
01:40:54,700 --> 01:40:58,086
Oh no! It's heading straight for the aquarium..!

1889
01:40:58,493 --> 01:40:59,078
Ugh!

1890
01:41:04,265 --> 01:41:06,682
So who the hell were those guys, anyway?

1891
01:41:06,730 --> 01:41:11,345
Hmph, who cares about them. They'll be dead soon enough.

1892
01:41:12,542 --> 01:41:16,358
Attention! Please move to the dolphin
show stadium immediately everyone!

1893
01:41:16,414 --> 01:41:17,739
It's too dangerous here!

1894
01:41:17,764 --> 01:41:18,615
The kids..!

1895
01:41:18,943 --> 01:41:20,713
Come on! Let's go!

1896
01:41:34,545 --> 01:41:36,490
It's accelerating downhill!

1897
01:41:36,490 --> 01:41:37,135
Conan!

1898
01:41:39,362 --> 01:41:40,460
Mr. Amuro!

1899
01:41:40,664 --> 01:41:41,976
You think you can stop it?

1900
01:41:42,001 --> 01:41:44,098
I don't know. But I can try!

1901
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:50,174
Gah!

1902
01:41:50,206 --> 01:41:50,993
What now?

1903
01:41:51,057 --> 01:41:52,898
Don't worry, concentrate!

1904
01:41:54,873 --> 01:41:55,872
Get ready!

1905
01:41:56,167 --> 01:41:57,015
Right!

1906
01:42:01,845 --> 01:42:03,226
Woaah!

1907
01:42:04,411 --> 01:42:08,692
Here I go!!

1908
01:42:12,891 --> 01:42:13,978
Mr. Akai!

1909
01:42:14,003 --> 01:42:15,806
You have something in mind, don't you?

1910
01:42:16,425 --> 01:42:16,885
Hm!

1911
01:42:34,747 --> 01:42:35,602
Come on!

1912
01:42:38,088 --> 01:42:40,877
Now... No, not yet?!

1913
01:42:42,347 --> 01:42:43,768
Hurry, Sonoko!

1914
01:42:44,858 --> 01:42:46,232
It's not going to stop!

1915
01:42:46,508 --> 01:42:48,616
I know! But there's still a way.

1916
01:42:48,726 --> 01:42:49,434
Huh?

1917
01:42:52,083 --> 01:42:52,866
Kudo!

1918
01:42:55,506 --> 01:42:58,295
Oh no! I'm not gonna make it in time now!

1919
01:42:59,479 --> 01:43:01,242
Hey, calm down!

1920
01:43:01,671 --> 01:43:03,448
Quick, here!

1921
01:43:11,902 --> 01:43:12,919
Please work!

1922
01:43:13,621 --> 01:43:14,818
Let's go!

1923
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:18,084
What?!

1924
01:43:18,814 --> 01:43:19,959
That ball..!

1925
01:43:20,290 --> 01:43:23,153
Gotta hurry! Come on inflate!

1926
01:43:23,862 --> 01:43:24,868
Keep going!

1927
01:43:29,889 --> 01:43:31,830
Damn, it's not enough!

1928
01:43:32,488 --> 01:43:32,964
Huh?!

1929
01:43:50,350 --> 01:43:51,129
Huh?

1930
01:43:56,166 --> 01:43:57,062
The kids..!

1931
01:44:02,865 --> 01:44:06,056
Stop!

1932
01:44:23,205 --> 01:44:24,148
Is it stop?

1933
01:44:24,272 --> 01:44:24,903
Yeah!

1934
01:44:26,157 --> 01:44:27,212
We're saved!

1935
01:44:27,286 --> 01:44:29,887
It was Conan! He's a hero!

1936
01:44:35,026 --> 01:44:35,899
Huh...

1937
01:44:37,328 --> 01:44:38,671
Well, I'm impressed.

1938
01:44:38,885 --> 01:44:42,054
Not everyone his size could
have stopped a giant Ferris wheel.

1939
01:44:43,620 --> 01:44:46,647
The crane truck... Amazing, wow.

1940
01:44:47,208 --> 01:44:49,775
Good work, kiddo.

1941
01:44:50,751 --> 01:44:52,199
Yeah... Thanks.

1942
01:45:02,272 --> 01:45:03,194
Hold it.

1943
01:45:03,345 --> 01:45:04,862
I want to ID the body.

1944
01:45:05,472 --> 01:45:09,583
All right, if you insist, but I don't know if
that'll be possible in it's current condition.

1945
01:45:10,521 --> 01:45:12,245
Thanks anyway. Go on.

1946
01:45:16,247 --> 01:45:16,925
Is that...

1947
01:45:17,212 --> 01:45:18,250
Yeah, it is.

1948
01:45:19,204 --> 01:45:22,232
Kid, could you show me what you just picked up?

1949
01:45:23,780 --> 01:45:25,610
Do you have any idea what it is?

1950
01:45:25,798 --> 01:45:27,562
A memory storage device?

1951
01:45:28,053 --> 01:45:28,571
No.

1952
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:29,160
Hm?

1953
01:45:30,050 --> 01:45:32,743
It's a memory of happier times.

1954
01:45:35,158 --> 01:45:37,540
A memory that will never be forgotten.

1955
01:49:57,183 --> 01:49:59,506
We've just received an update on the explosion...

1956
01:49:59,531 --> 01:50:00,747
Almost made it!

1957
01:50:00,881 --> 01:50:02,317
I mean, kinda.

1958
01:50:02,556 --> 01:50:04,716
You're really bad at this.

1959
01:50:05,028 --> 01:50:08,260
You think so? Well then why don't you try it next?

1960
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:10,200
Fine, maybe I will!

1961
01:50:10,225 --> 01:50:12,431
I just... keep thinking.

1962
01:50:13,011 --> 01:50:15,095
She said she wanted to save us.

1963
01:50:15,621 --> 01:50:16,341
I know...

1964
01:50:17,097 --> 01:50:20,537
Otherwise she wouldn't have been
holding onto her keychain like that...

1965
01:50:21,299 --> 01:50:24,239
But then why did she? I don't understand it.

1966
01:50:25,239 --> 01:50:27,815
Uh-huh! She played games with us!

1967
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:32,396
We gave her a keychain! And she
was really happy about it, right?

1968
01:50:32,810 --> 01:50:36,132
Yup! We've all got the same kind, but in different colors!

1969
01:50:36,180 --> 01:50:36,634
See!

1970
01:50:36,658 --> 01:50:37,634
Here's mine!

1971
01:50:37,806 --> 01:50:38,491
Cute!

1972
01:50:39,159 --> 01:50:41,455
But now she's gone I guess.

1973
01:50:42,225 --> 01:50:45,730
Maybe her memory's back and she
went home to where ever she's from.

1974
01:50:45,945 --> 01:50:49,520
Too bad... And just when we were
becoming such good friends too.

1975
01:50:49,719 --> 01:50:50,266
Yeah.

1976
01:50:51,273 --> 01:50:54,612
Sounds like, you're already
friends with her now aren't you?

1977
01:50:54,997 --> 01:50:57,337
Cause that's why you're thinking about her so much.

1978
01:50:57,393 --> 01:50:58,280
You're right!

1979
01:50:58,280 --> 01:50:59,323
Hey, good point!

1980
01:50:59,737 --> 01:51:00,255
Yeah!

1981
01:51:00,521 --> 01:51:03,533
At the very end, maybe the kids changed her?

1982
01:51:04,605 --> 01:51:05,220
Yeah...

1983
01:51:05,916 --> 01:51:09,412
With their help, she found her true colors...
