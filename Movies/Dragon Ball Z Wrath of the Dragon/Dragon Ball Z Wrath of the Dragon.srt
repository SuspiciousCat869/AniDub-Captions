Hoy was a member
of the Kash-Phar:

Power-hungry aliens who
believe themselves to be

497

the superior species
of the universe.

498
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:34,833
For eons they've
traveled the stars, 

499

using their dark magic
to hunt down and exterminate

500

all life forms
different from their own. 

501
01:28:41,033 --> 01:28:44,333
On Conose, they revived an
evil long thought destroyed

502
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,200
by my ancestors:

503
01:28:46,266 --> 01:28:49,000
Hirudegarn,
a malevolent assassin 

504
01:28:49,066 --> 01:28:53,033
that consumes its victims
and imprisons their life force.

505

Hoy was a villain...

half our population.

any worse than it is...

510
01:29:06,033 --> 01:29:09,566
So... How did your world handle
such an incredible threat?

511
01:29:09,633 --> 01:29:12,466
It wasn't until we stumbled
upon an enchanted sword

512
01:29:12,533 --> 01:29:15,566
that we realized
we even had a chance.

513
01:29:15,633 --> 01:29:18,066
Oh my gosh!
Is that it?

514
01:29:20,133 --> 01:29:23,900
A wizard found it
in the Wraith's temple...

515
01:29:23,966 --> 01:29:26,933
Along with the blade,
two ocarinas were discovered. 

516
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,333
My brother and I used them in
hopes of distracting the beast.

517
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,000
They must have been
enchanted as well,

518
01:29:32,066 --> 01:29:34,100
for neither one of us
knew how to play.

519
01:29:34,166 --> 01:29:37,500
The melody seemed to
consume Hirudegarn with rage,

520
01:29:37,566 --> 01:29:41,700
but try as it might,
the beast could do us no harm. 

521
01:29:41,766 --> 01:29:45,466
At that moment, the wizard
took up the sword and charged. 

522
01:29:45,533 --> 01:29:49,066
The monster barely had time
to react before the blade...

523
01:29:49,133 --> 01:29:50,966
...cleaved him in two.

524
01:29:59,133 --> 01:30:00,533
What should have ended there, 

525
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,800
turned out to be
only the beginning...

526
01:30:02,866 --> 01:30:04,900
Hirudegarn survived.

527
01:30:04,966 --> 01:30:06,666
To prevent it from
becoming whole again,

528
01:30:06,733 --> 01:30:09,766
the wizard confined
it's upper half inside me,

529
01:30:09,833 --> 01:30:12,200
and the lower,
inside my brother.

and Minotia and I became heroes.

We had no choice...

536

It was the only way to ensure
that the Kash-Phar wouldn't

be able to get their hands
on us... we thought...

538
01:30:37,033 --> 01:30:39,666
The wizard agreed to
conduct the procedure, 

539
01:30:39,733 --> 01:30:41,933
but vowed to release us
once the Kash-Phar had been
