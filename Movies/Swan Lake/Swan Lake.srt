(water sloshes)

5
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,325
- Oh, Hans, isn't she beautiful?

6
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:25,747
- Huh, did you say
something to me, Margarita?

7
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,249
- I'm talking about that
swan with the crown.

8
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,083
- [Hans] Huh?

9
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,960
- Isn't she just magnificent?

10
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,170
- Don't you go away.

11
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,756
- What are you up to now, Hans?

12
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:39,093
(\"Swan Lake\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky)

13
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,349
- Fit for a princess, my princess.

14
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,146
I've got a surprise for you.

15
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,648
- You have a what?

16
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:55,193
- But you have to close your
eyes, Princess Margarita.

17
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,861
- Sometimes, you're so silly.

18
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,198
Can I open my eyes now?

19
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,741
♪ Tah dah dah dah ♪

20
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,744
♪ Tah dah dah dah, dah dah dah ♪

21
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,287
(gasps) Oh, no!

22
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,705
- What is it, Hans?

23
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,791
What on earth is the matter?

24
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,625
- Uh, oh.

25
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,171
- Oh, what is this thing?

26
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,715
Ugh, you are such a jug, Hans.

27
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,925
(horse neighs)

28
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,220
(gasps) I'd know that horse anywhere.

29
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,848
It's Prince Siegfried
coming from the castle.

30
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,811
- Wait for me Margarita!

31
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,366
Wait, Margarita, wait!

32
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,119
- Boo, now we're even, Hans, hmm.

33
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,378
(\"Swan Lake\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky)

34
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,799
Oh, prince, you're so wonderful,

35
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,801
not like that stupid Hans.

36
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,595
- Will you please stop
comparing me to him?

37
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,849
And, hey, by the way, when are
you going to marry me anyway?

38
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,810
- Oh, don't be silly, I'd never marry you.

39
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:12,979
Prince Siegfried.

40
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,902
I'm fainting, oh.

41
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,071
- Oh, watch out.

42
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,531
Oh.

43
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,451
(both groan)

44
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,910
- You saved my life, Hans.

45
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,745
(lips smack)

46
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,830
(both gasp)

47
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,248
Hans.

48
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,166
(Hans chuckles)

49
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:37,503
(\"Swan Lake\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky)

50
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,436
- Swans.

51
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:10,661
Wow.

52
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,802
Oh, how strange.

53
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,141
(gasps)

54
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,270
Oh.

55
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,238
I feel like I'm being
watched by a beautiful lady.

56
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,201
- [Adolf] Prince Siegfried,

57
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,994
is something wrong your highness?

58
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,371
- Take a look over there.

59
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,375
- Ooh, would you look at that?

60
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,252
A swan with a crown on it's head.

61
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,421
- Well, blow me down.

62
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,137
(wings flap)

63
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,148
(Siegfried gasps)

64
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,566
- Look, the swan.

65
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,778
- Ah.

66
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,447
(bow creaks)

67
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,031
What are you doing?

68
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,366
- I'm going to bring that swan home,

69
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,326
so you can hang her up over the fireplace.

70
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,245
- [Prince Siegfried] No, don't shoot!

71
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,329
- [Adolf] Oh!

72
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,248
- Adolf!

73
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,461
Look, look, Adolf's been
turned into a statue.

74
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,004
- I knew there must be something strange

75
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,589
about this forest, your highness.

76
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,258
I bet it has something to do
with that mysterious swan.

77
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,051
- But she was so beautiful.

78
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,310
- We'd best get out of here
in a hurry, your highness,

79
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,561
before the sun goes down.

80
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,784
(\"Swan Lake\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky)

81
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,977
- [Prince Siegfried] I
just don't understand it.

82
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,729
- [Benno] Excuse me, your highness,

83
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,899
I don't think it's hard
to understand at all.

84
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,152
That swan with a crown must
be some kind of a witch.

85
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,195
When you come to think of it,

86
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,073
no one has ever been to the
other side of that lake, ever.

87
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:55,701
- No, no, I can't believe
anything as beautiful as that swan

88
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,453
could possibly be a witch.

89
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,289
- But, your highness, you
saw Adolf turn into a statue

90
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,375
when he tried to shoot that swan.

91
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,960
If you take my advice, your highness,

92
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,255
you won't ever go near
that enchanted lake again.

93
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:10,007
- [Woman] Prince Siegfried,
the queen wants to see you.

94
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,136
(regal music)

95
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,516
- [Prince Siegfried] Hello, Mother.

96
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:22,562
- Tomorrow is your birthday,
Siegfried, your 21st birthday.

97
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,355
You're all grown up now, my son.

98
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,481
- [Prince Siegfried] I hope so.

99
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,192
- Of course, since your poor
father's no longer with us,

100
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,361
you automatically become
lord of the kingdom.

101
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,863
You'll have to marry someone right away.

102
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,157
You can choose someone at the ball.

103
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,326
- Do I have to marry someone?

104
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,079
- Of course, how can a
king rule his kingdom

105
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,747
without a queen by his side?

106
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,999
- [Prince Siegfried] But--

107
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,083
- There's nothing to worry about,

108
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,252
I've already sent invitations to six

109
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,504
of the most beautiful
princesses in the land.

110
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,589
And they will all be here

111
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,924
at the ball tomorrow night, Siegfried.

112
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,760
It's up to you to decide
which one you want to marry.

113
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,138
I warn you, it won't be easy.

114
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,723
- Do I really have to?

115
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,600
What's the big hurry, Mother?

116
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,269
- My boy, that's the law, dear.

117
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,023
It's always been the law and
it wall always be the law,

118
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:07,982
unless you already have

119
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,942
someone you want to marry, Siegfried.

120
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:10,818
- How could I?

121
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,945
I never meet anyone around here.

122
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,156
- Always complaining.

123
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,699
Until tomorrow.

124
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,825
- [Prince Siegfried] Goodbye, Mother.

125
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,545
- Well, congratulations, your highness.

126
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,422
- You better stop it.

127
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,757
Just because I'm turning 21,

128
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,883
and taking over the kingdom,

129
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,719
and getting married to someone
I don't love all in one day,

130
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,221
doesn't mean you have the
right to make fun of me.

131
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,557
I wish there was some way out.

132
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,851
How can I marry a stranger?

133
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,395
I know what I'll do, give up.

134
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,231
I've never disobeyed my mother,

135
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,983
and I can't start doing it now.

136
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,903
- Why are you so surprised?

137
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,905
You were born a prince
and this is your fate,

138
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,490
so you have to accept it.

139
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:18,678
(\"Swan Lake\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky)

140
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,194
- Benno, Benno!

141
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,030
- What is it, your highness?

142
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,865
- I have to see that swan
with the crown again,

143
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,075
Benno, right now.

144
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,576
- [Benno] (gasps) You're crazy.

145
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,453
- So I am crazy.

146
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,206
- [Benno] If your highness
says so, who am I to disagree?

147
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,958
- If that swan is really a witch,

148
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,169
if it really has magical
powers like you say it does,

149
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,421
then I'm going back to that lake

150
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,631
and make it turn Adolf back into a person.

151
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,757
- Don't do it, your highness,

152
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,176
what if you got turned
into a frog or something?

153
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,804
- Well, then, I'll just have
to find a beautiful princess

154
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,723
to kiss me and turn me back into a prince.

155
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,849
Don't try and stop me.

156
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:05,683
- I won't.

157
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:17,570
(\"Swan Lake\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky)

158
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,036
- Now, how on earth did
that statue get here?

159
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,122
- [Margarita] Hans, Hans!

160
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,166
- Coming.

161
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,004
What's wrong, Margarita?

162
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,673
- The swan with the crown is leaving.

163
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,259
(swans squawk)

164
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,063
- Don't you worry about a thing, Adolf.

165
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,030
- Oh, why is the prince back so soon?

166
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:04,992
- Look over the there,

167
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,787
the swan with the crown
is leaving, let's go.

168
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,539
- [Benno] Where are we going?

169
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,128
- Why is Prince Siegfried
following that beautiful swan?

170
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,672
What are you waiting for?

171
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,092
- Huh, why do I have to come?

172
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,310
- [Prince Siegfried] Why does
this stupid road have to end?

173
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,772
- Because it's time to
give up and go back home.

174
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,981
- Hiyah, hiyah.

175
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,358
(horse neighs)

176
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:41,612
(\"Swan Lake\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky)

177
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,078
- [Benno] You can't go
up there, your highness,

178
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,371
it's too steep.

179
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,751
- I love you, Prince
Siegfried, you're so brave.

180
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,338
- That other guy's never gonna make it.

181
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:05,928
- (grunts) Come on, come on.
(horse neighs)

182
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,181
- [Benno] Wait for me,
Prince Siegfried, wait.

183
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,026
- [Hans] Margarita.

184
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,361
- [Margarita] What is it now?

185
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,195
- [Hans] Where are we going?

186
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,071
- [Margarita] Honestly, Hans,

187
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,782
sometimes you ask the
most idiotic questions.

188
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,119
- So what's that Prince Siegfried got

189
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,412
that I haven't got, hmm?

190
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,339
- [Prince Siegfried] Yah!

191
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,761
(Margarita gasps)

192
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,137
- Let's go back, Margarita,

193
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,139
it's too dangerous for us here.

194
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,557
- You would say that.

195
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,269
- Yah (yelps).

196
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,396
- Margarita!

197
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:44,860
- (whimpers) I'm dying, I'm dying.

198
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,739
Farewell my prince,

199
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,116
you'll never know how much I loved you.

200
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,078
- Well, if you need some
help getting up from there,

201
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,788
you can just call your prince.

202
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:05,881
- Come on, boy, there's
nothing to be afraid of, hiyah.

203
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:17,643
(\"Swan Lake\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky)

204
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,407
How far is that swan going to go?

205
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,329
(horse neighs)

206
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,832
Ah, stead boy, steady.

207
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,834
Come on, come on.

208
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,336
(bats squawk)

209
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,716
Whoa, what a terrible place.

210
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,970
(horse neighs)

211
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:19,079
(horse neighs)

212
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,375
(gasps) What's that?

213
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,552
The swan.

214
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:47,858
(\"Swan Lake\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky)

215
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,365
Huh?

216
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,646
- Did you see what I saw,

217
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,606
or is all of this a bad dream?

218
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,859
- You shouldn't be afraid now,
nothing's gonna happen to us.

219
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:34,780
- Right, because the prince
is here to protect us.

220
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,670
(water splashes)

221
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,888
- [Odette] Oh, Prince Siegfried.

222
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:03,475
- Huh, how do you know what my name is?

223
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:07,146
What on earth made you turn
into a human being like that?

224
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,398
Can you tell me what's
going on around here?

225
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:21,076
- I can tell you that my name
is Odette, Prince Siegfried.

226
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:24,997
- Odette, are you a swan that
turned into a human being?

227
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,624
Or are you a human being
that turned into a swan?

228
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,836
- I'm really a human being,

229
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,547
but an evil sorcerer put
me under a magic spell,

230
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,507
and turned me into a swan.

231
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,592
- An evil sorcerer?

232
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,888
- Yes, I can only turn
back into a human girl

233
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:44,683
after the sun goes down
and the moon comes out.

234
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,437
- Then the spell that turned
my friend Adolf into a statue?

235
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,856
- [Odette] Yes, that was Rothbart's doing.

236
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,732
- Who's Rothbart?

237
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,944
- Did you see that strange
owl in the forest by the lake?

238
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,322
- [Siegfried] Yes, I did see an owl.

239
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,074
- That owl was Rothbart

240
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,911
in one of his more horrible disguises.

241
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,245
- That was him?

242
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,331
- You'd better go now, Prince Siegfried,

243
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,457
if I know Rothbart,

244
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,710
he's probably listening
to every word we say.

245
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,379
- (gasps) So you mean this
place is Rothbart's castle?

246
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,258
(uneasy music)

247
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,803
- That's the sorcerer's castle, Margarita.

248
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:25,390
- I hope nothing terrible
happens to Prince Siegfried.

249
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,517
- [Siegfried] I'll show that
Rothbart a thing or two.

250
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,061
- No, you mustn't go into the castle.

251
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,312
- Don't try and stop me,

252
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,689
I must save my friend
from that evil spell.

253
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,276
- Do you honestly think
you can hurt Rothbart

254
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,111
with that tiny little sword of yours?

255
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,322
- What makes you so
certain that I couldn't?

256
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,491
- We tried to fight against Rothbart,

257
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,035
he destroyed my entire country.

258
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:48,455
- (gasps) Rothbart destroyed it?

259
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,915
- [Odette] I was once the princess

260
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:53,001
of a beautiful land far across the sea.

261
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,795
Three years ago, Rothbart came

262
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:58,799
and asked for my hand
in marriage, I refused.

263
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,426
He kept asking and when I kept saying no,

264
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,303
he threatened to destroy my country

265
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,805
and everyone in it.

266
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,683
We tried to fight him, but it was useless.

267
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,226
He destroyed my land,

268
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,478
and then kidnapped me and brought me here.

269
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,690
- But why does this Rothbart

270
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,150
make you turn into a swan every morning?

271
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,528
- Because he never wants
me to meet another man

272
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,238
for the rest of my life.

273
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,322
- Why not?

274
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,658
- If a man comes along who truly loves me

275
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,451
with all his heart and soul,

276
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,370
then Rothbart will lose his power,

277
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,789
and all his spells will be broken forever.

278
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,709
That's why he turns me
into a swan everyday,

279
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,169
to make sure that I won't
ever meet such a man.

280
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,838
- No, is that really true?

281
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:41,216
- Yes, he has cast this spell upon me

282
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,468
to prove that I am under his power,

283
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,971
and that there is no way for me to escape.

284
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,141
- [Siegfried] Then my love for
you is going to destroy him.

285
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,518
- Don't say that, Rothbart
will kill you first.

286
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,936
He's stronger than you are.

287
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:55,188
- Nothing is stronger
than what I feel for you.

288
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,691
I felt it from the first
moment I saw you on the lake,

289
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,860
even though you were only a swan.

290
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,320
When you looked at me with those eyes,

291
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,574
I knew I'd never love anyone
else for as long as I lived.

292
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,326
Odette, I love you.

293
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,078
Tomorrow night at my castle
there's going to be a ball,

294
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,997
and I have to choose someone to marry.

295
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,126
Come to the ball,

296
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:20,255
come to the ball and I'll
choose to marry you, Odette.

297
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,882
- [Odette] No, don't, don't say that.

298
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,884
- Odette, I know we just met,

299
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,844
but I can't believe that anyone in world

300
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,929
could love someone as much as I love you.

301
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,390
Come to my castle tomorrow.

302
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,185
Marry me and you won't have
to live your whole life

303
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,728
in fear of Rothbart.

304
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:37,189
- Rothbart will never let me go.

305
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:41,193
Goodbye, go away before he kills you.

306
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:45,238
- Odette, wait, you have to
come to the ball tomorrow night,

307
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,656
you have to, Odette.

308
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,742
I'm never going to marry anyone else.

309
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,786
I'm in love with you, Odette.

310
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,122
- Siegfried, unless you must
leave this place at once,

311
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,958
he will kill you, I know it.

312
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,710
- All right, I'll go away,

313
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,463
but you have to promise me
that you'll come to the ball.

314
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,631
- [Odette] No, no.

315
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,758
- Then I'm going away, Odette.

316
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,847
I'd rather be killed by Rothbart tonight,

317
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,391
then think of you living your whole life

318
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,892
in this horrible castle.

319
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,727
Odette, please.

320
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:19,439
- [Odette] (sobs) No.

321
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,650
- Why do you want me to die

322
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,362
when we can both live
happily ever after together?

323
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,364
- [Odette] You fool.

324
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,865
- [Siegfried] I'll be waiting.

325
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,953
(tender music)

326
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,455
(Odette sighs)

327
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,470
(Rothbart snores)

328
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,778
- All he ever wants to do is sleep.

329
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:33,990
It's time to wake up now,
Daddy, it's dark outside.

330
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,617
(\"Swan Lake\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky)

331
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,868
- Huh, huh?

332
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,121
- [Odille] You look even
worse than usual, Daddy.

333
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,540
Is something wrong?

334
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,043
- Every single time I
turn someone into a statue

335
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,962
it really takes it out of me, you know?

336
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,130
Especially in broad daylight (grunts).

337
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,678
- You certainly are crazy
about the boring Odette,

338
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:55,887
aren't you Daddy?

339
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,141
- Crazy, why that's not the word for it.

340
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,851
She's the only thing in the world

341
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,020
worth getting out of bed for.

342
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,732
Mmm, I think I'll propose
again tonight (laughs).

343
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,195
Maybe she'll even say yes.

344
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:15,740
I feel lucky.

345
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:23,456
- Daddy, dear, if I were you,

346
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:27,335
I wouldn't get my engines
revved up quite so soon.

347
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:30,005
- No, and why shouldn't I
get my engines revved up?

348
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,551
- Your precious Odette's
been seeing a young man.

349
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,511
- Why didn't you say
so in the first place?

350
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:39,014
- Because you were too
busy picking up the flowers

351
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,307
you wanted for your wedding.

352
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,141
- [Rothbart] What's he like?

353
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,351
- Well, Daddy, I hate to say this,

354
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:46,563
but that Prince Siegfried
is a dreamboat on wheels.

355
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,064
- Prince Siegfried?

356
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,358
- And he'll be King Siegfried tomorrow.

357
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:51,651
- Are you telling me the truth?

358
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:52,902
- Would I lie?

359
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,781
He's invited her to a dance
at his castle tomorrow,

360
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:00,243
and you can bet your wolf's
bane he'll ask her to marry him.

361
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:02,203
- Why that lousy pipsqueak,

362
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,538
I'll turn him into a goose

363
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,081
and I'll have him for dinner (growls).

364
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,583
- Your blood pressure, Daddy.

365
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,044
- Where are you Siegfried?

366
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:15,008
Nobody does this to
Rothbart the magnificent.

367
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,844
I'll find you if it takes me all night.

368
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,929
- You can turn the
whole castle upside down

369
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,348
and you still wouldn't find him.

370
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,808
- [Rothbart] Are you telling
me the rat's out of the trap?

371
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,977
- And he almost brought the cheese.

372
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:26,811
- Where's Odette?

373
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,980
- Oh, I'm sure she's safe and sound

374
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,649
up there in her little birdcage,

375
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,900
dreaming of her sweetheart,

376
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,735
and crying into her pillow.

377
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,240
Maybe if you lost a few pounds
and shaved once in a while

378
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,494
she wouldn't fall for the
first guy that came along.

379
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,328
- [Rothbart] Shut up!

380
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,120
- Oh, oh.

381
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:49,584
- No more mister nice guy,
my little princess (screams).

382
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,011
That Siegfried lays one hand on my Odette,

383
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,971
I'll turn him into a hundred pigeons

384
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,723
and put him in a pie.

385
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:08,853
I'll pulverize him and
sprinkle it on my corn flakes.

386
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,773
(pants and coughs)

387
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,084
(grunts)

388
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,511
Odette, it's me.

389
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,722
(Odette gasps)

390
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,850
I hope you're decent
because I'm coming in.

391
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:50,103
Hello, there, how are
you this fine evening?

392
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:53,106
(\"Swan Lake\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky)

393
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,900
And who was that young man
you were chatting with today?

394
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,530
Prince Siegfried from that silly castle.

395
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,699
- But how, but how did you know?

396
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,828
- You can't hide anything
from Rothbart, princess.

397
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,831
I let you meet him because
thought it time you found out

398
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:13,626
how pathetic all the men in
the world are compared to me.

399
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,462
But forget all that,

400
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,756
are you ready to accept
my humble proposal,

401
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,008
settle down, and start raising a family?

402
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:25,764
I've been patient for
all these years, Odette.

403
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:29,392
Just say that one little word
and make me a very happy man.

404
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:30,518
I love you (whimpers).

405
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,814
(growls)

406
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,158
Oh, my precious Odette,
say that you'll marry me,

407
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:48,036
and I'll give you the most
beautiful things in the world.

408
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,580
Why if you marry me, I'll give
you more money for clothes

409
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,332
than you could spend in a lifetime.

410
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:02,008
Answer me Odette, don't you
like talking to me anymore?

411
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:05,178
Until you accept my offer,

412
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,513
I'll have to keep turning you

413
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,599
into a swan every morning of your life.

414
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,476
Doesn't that bother you?

415
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,686
- [Odette] I don't want your money.

416
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,188
I don't want to settle down

417
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,690
and raise a family in this castle.

418
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,818
There's only one thing I want.

419
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,237
- I'll give you anything you want, Odette.

420
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:25,073
- All I want is to live
with someone I love.

421
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,533
- Someone you love?

422
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,076
- [Odette] Mm hmm.

423
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:33,081
- (grunts) Please, tell me it
isn't true, Odette, please.

424
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,044
(bird tweets)

425
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,758
So it's that puny little
Prince Siegfried you're

426
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:44,968
in love with, isn't it?

427
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:49,055
I'm the only man for you, Odette.

428
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:52,559
Please, tell me, please, Odette.

429
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,564
Tell my why you haven't
fallen in love with me yet?

430
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,066
Why don't you make me
fall in love with you?

431
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,068
If you're the greatest
wizard in the world,

432
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:04,028
that shouldn't be a problem for you.

433
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,613
- Quiet, enough!

434
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,615
all the power of all
the wizards in the world

435
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:10,493
can't move a single human heart.

436
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,328
You think I would've
waited all these years

437
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,122
if hocus pocus could've helped me?

438
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,084
(footsteps thud)

439
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,169
Oh, please, Odette, take pity on me,

440
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,422
I'm a much better person than you think.

441
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,841
Or would you rather marry
that primping little prince

442
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,343
on his ridiculous prancing palomino?

443
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,177
- Yes.

444
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,681
- But why, how could you
be in love with someone

445
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,601
you never laid eyes on until today?

446
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,977
- [Odette] You're wrong about that.

447
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,103
I've been in love with Siegfried

448
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,689
from the first time I swam onto that lake.

449
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,609
- What, for three years?

450
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,445
- Every time he went out
hunting with his friends,

451
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,780
I'd go down to the lake
and watch him go by.

452
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,534
- So that's why you never
fell in love with me,

453
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,077
even a little bit.

454
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,162
Don't push your luck with me,

455
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,081
there's only so much
humiliation a sorcerer can take,

456
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,001
you know, even from the
only woman he'll ever love.

457
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:00,919
Why, if I felt like it,

458
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,421
I could turn you into
a slimy little snake.

459
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,881
If you don't do what I say,

460
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,675
I'll turn you into a caterpillar,
Odette, just watch me.

461
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,261
- (gasps) Oh, no!

462
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,600
- But I didn't do that to you, Odette,

463
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,936
I turned you into a beautiful swan.

464
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:20,855
Don't you see why?

465
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,691
It's only because I love you, Odette,

466
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:26,152
it's proof of how much I love.

467
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:29,906
- It's not, if you loved me
as much as you say you do,

468
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,659
you wouldn't have done
anything to make me so unhappy.

469
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,413
If you really want to
prove how much you love me,

470
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,374
if you really want to prove it,

471
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,833
then leave my room immediately,

472
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,920
because you're the last person
in the world I care to see.

473
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,712
- Huh?

474
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,806
How dare you, how dare you say that?

475
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:58,476
Odette, do you want to
go to this secret ball?

476
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,853
Hmm, and you think I'd let you go?

477
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,480
(laughs) You obviously don't know

478
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,983
very much about Rothbart
the magnificent (coughs).

479
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,076
- Oh, my poor little friend, forgive me.

480
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:34,971
- My poor little Odette,
like a bird in a gilded cage.

481
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,933
It looks like your gallant
Prince Siegfried will have

482
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,977
to choose some other princess to marry

483
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,146
at that ball my little sparrow (laughs).

484
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:49,944
- [Odette] Oh, Siegfried,
Prince Siegfried (sobs).

485
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,326
(tense music)

486
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:22,518
- So this is what I get
for loving a princess?

487
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,940
(growls)

488
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,358
- I'll bet I can guess what put you

489
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,068
in such a terrible mood (giggles).

490
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,571
- What's so funny about it?

491
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:18,116
- She turned you down again, didn't she?

492
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:18,950
- Shut up.

493
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,370
- It's hopeless, Daddy,
she'll never marry you,

494
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,872
no matter how long you keep on waiting.

495
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,249
- Enough is enough!

496
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,837
- Oh my, so now you hate her, do you?

497
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:35,466
- I certainly do, she
dares to break my heart.

498
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,093
- Why not kill her?

499
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:37,927
- What?

500
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,804
- That would solve all your problems.

501
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,389
You can't wait forever.

502
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,682
And she'll never say yes,

503
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,934
so you might as well get rid of her now.

504
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:46,727
- Hmm,

505
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,773
oh, oh.

506
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:53,192
- A good idea, don't you think?

507
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,694
- No, that's something I could never do,

508
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:55,987
never in a million years.

509
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,865
I could never do anything
to hurt my beautiful Odette.

510
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,659
- [Odille] Oh, how did you
get to be such a softie?

511
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,202
If you don't have the guts to do it,

512
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,036
I'll do it for you.

513
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:07,498
- No, please, put that horrible
thought out of your mind.

514
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,126
I love her too much, Odille, please.

515
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,549

(\"Swan Lake\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky)

517
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:31,147
- [Siegfried] Of course, she'll
come, I just know she will.

518
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,357
- [Benno] But, your highness,
if that sorcerer, Rothbart,

519
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,567
uses his evil powers--

520
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,028
- Don't say that, I'll
never marry anyone but her.

521
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,822
- [Benno] But what if she doesn't show up?

522
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:40,948
- She will show up.

523
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,952
If you'd looked in her
eyes the way I have Benno,

524
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,704
you'd know that she could never break

525
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,664
a promise to anyone, never.

526
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,836
She'll be here, Benno.

527
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:56,297
And the minute that I am
king, she'll be my queen.

528
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:58,716
You'll see.

529
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:23,407
- Wake up, Margarita, wake up, wake up.

530
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,700
- Now what do you want?

531
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,577
- Well, its just that.

532
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,411
- Out with it.

533
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,955
- Out with it, okay.

534
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,539
You see, I was just thinking

535
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:31,958
about Prince Siegfried and Odette,

536
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,960
and it made me think of, well (giggles),

537
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:38,047
did anyone ever tell you how
much you look like Odette, hm?

538
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,009
- You know, Hans, flattery
will get you everywhere.

539
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,011
And to tell you the truth,

540
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,264
I was just lying alone here
in the moonlight thinking

541
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,474
about Prince Siegfried and Odette myself.

542
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,518
I keep thinking about that ball (sighs).

545
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:16,002
All right, Hans, you can stop that now.

546
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,963
I said you can stop singing.

547
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:22,383
- Huh, but the night is
still young, Margarita.

548
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:24,635
Bye-bye.

549
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,054
- Don't go, Hans.

550
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:30,266
I, uh, oh, you're so silly.

551
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:36,063
Mm, see you tomorrow, Hans.

552
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,819

00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,037
wake up, Margarita.

560
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,289
What a sleepy head.

561
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:39,710
That's funny, where could she have gone?

562
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,391
Margarita, Margarita!

563
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,143
- Shh!

564
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,313
Look.

565
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:04,902

Have you ever seen anything so wonderful?

- The swans are all
excited about something.

575

Something's up, that's for sure,

576
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,496
- We'd better go down and see.

577
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,497
- Okay.

(\"Swan Lake\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky)

579

Princess Odette isn't here today.

580
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,975
- That must be why they're so excited.

581
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,017
- Must be sick.

582
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,060
- But for the last three years,

583
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,313
Odette hasn't missed one
single day, not one single day.

584
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,399
- Well, there's always
a first time, you know.

585
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,401
- Oh, she must have been
locked up in the castle

586
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,861
by that evil magician Rothbart.

587
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,780
- Oh, no, that means she won't be able

588
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,907
to go to the ball tonight, Margarita.

589
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:57,992
- That's right, Hans,

590
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,868
and that means Prince Siegfried
is going to have to pick

591
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:03,122
one of those other princesses to marry.

592
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,332
- Hmm, what do we do Margarita?

593
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,167
- There's nothing we can do now.

594
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,794
- There's gotta be something.

595

- I know what,

598
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:19,680
I'll go to the castle

599
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,890
and tell Prince Siegfried all about it.

600
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,183
- Prince Siegfried?

601
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,810
- We're just a couple of squirrels.

602
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,521
We couldn't possibly help
Odette without Prince Siegfried.

603
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,480
- That's for sure.

604
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,066
- And now, Hans, you
go to Rothbart's castle

605
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:33,277
and find out what terrible
thing he's done to Odette.

606
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,362
- But, but, you've gotta be joking,

607
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:37,615
go to Rothbart's castle alone?

608
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,449
I, uh.

609
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:43,078
- If you're saying you're
afraid to go into the forest,

610
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,080
then you can forget all about marrying me,

611
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,583
because I'm not going
to marry a coward, hm.

612
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:51,795
- Oh, right, don't get
so upset, I'm going.

613
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:52,963
- I'm so proud of you.

614
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,801
- Will you be proud of me when I'm dead?

615
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:58,636
Oh.

616
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,223
(somber music)

617
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,905
- Oh, Prince Siegfried, I'm so sorry.

618
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,912
(menacing music)

619
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,336
- [Odille] Huh.

620
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,761
- Ah, I know how to solve my problem,

621
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,805
I'll murder Prince Siegfried.

622
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,181
- [Odille] Murder the prince?

623
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,684
- Yes, once the prince is
dead, she'll be so unhappy,

624
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,811
she'll have to fall in
love with me (laughs).

625
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,312
- Oh, that's brilliant, Daddy.

626
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:53,649
You have such a fabulous
understanding of human nature.

627
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,609
Don't you see, if the prince is dead,

628
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:58,070
she won't forget about him
for as long as she lives.

629
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,446
- You're right again, Odille.

630
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:00,656
What'll I do?

631
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:04,159
How can I make her love me?

632
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:07,413
- Well, I can think of
one way out of this.

633
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,748
- Oh, tell me quickly.

634
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,041
Make Odette fall in love with me

635
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,669
and I'll give you a whole planet to rule.

636
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:17,172
- We make Siegfried fall
in love with someone else.

637
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:18,841
- Mm, but suppose that idiotic prince

638
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:21,385
won't fall in love with
anyone else except Odette.

639
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,678
What do we do then?

640
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,304
- [Odille] I'll show you, Daddy.

641
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,099
- What are you, what are you doing?

642
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,852
(riveting music)

643
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:36,316
Oh, ah, Odette, my princess!

644
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:38,026
- Don't get all hot
under the collar, Daddy,

645
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:39,653
it's me Odille.

646
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,363
- [Rothbart] Well, you
certainly look like Odette.

647
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:43,323
I can't believe it (giggles).

648
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,117
- Believe it, Daddy.

649
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,453
I just know, the minute
I walk into that ball,

650
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:49,872
he'll fall in love with me.

651
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:52,374
- Only a daughter of
Rothbart the magnificent

652
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:53,917
could come up with such an idea.

653
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,544
If you show up at the ball like that,

654
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,713
you'll have the prince
crawling on his knees.

655
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,423
You are brilliant, my dear.

656
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,008
- You know, I don't think I'd mind

657
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,135
marrying that gorgeous Siegfried.

658
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,678
If that's all right with you, Daddy.

659
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:06,221
- Of course, you may
marry Prince Siegfried,

660
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:09,683
as long as you keep him out
of my hair and Odette's.

661
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:10,601
- Play your cards right,

662
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,603
and she might even marry you, hmm?

663
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,358
- (laughs) I'm so lucky.

664
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:23,197
- We've got lots of things to
do before the ball, you know,

665
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,948
so you'd better stop
laughing like an idiot

666
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:25,783
and get some rest.

667
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:29,536
- Yes, beautiful sleep, that's
what Rothbart needs (laughs).

668
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,291
Lucky, lucky!

669
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:41,423
(\"Swan Lake\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky)

670
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:04,947
(regal music)

671
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,931
- Huh, hmm.

672
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,057
- What's wrong?

673
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:35,394
- Either I saw a squirrel
riding on that coach,

674
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,104
or I'm crazy.

675
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,284
(Margarita chitters)

676
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:52,452
- Huh, well a squirrel.

677
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:54,580
You're pretty brave to come

678
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,832
all the way up here from the forest.

679
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,625
Did you come for the ball?

680
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:01,712
(Margarita chitters)

681
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:04,798
What's bothering you?

682
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,552
- [Margarita] Of course,
he doesn't understand

683
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,512
one single word I'm saying.

684
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:11,346
What'll I do?

685
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:16,226
- I wish you could take
a message to Odette

686
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:19,313
to remind her that she
promised to come to the ball.

687
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:22,024
She's got to come, or I'll
have to marry some stranger.

688
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:25,110
(Margarita chitters)

689
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,073
Goodbye, squirrel, this
castle's no place for you.

690
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,700
(Margarita chitters)

691
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,743
What's the matter?

692
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:54,932
- Oh, my gosh, what now?

693
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,225
How am I supposed to
get into Odette's room?

694
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:58,769
If only I could fly.

695
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:07,986
Hmm, all I have to do is move this chain.

696
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:15,035
(grunts) It won't budge an inch.

697
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,329
I'm no good at anything.

698
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:26,588
Oh!

699
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,427
(Odette gasps)

700
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:34,554
- (grunts) Who's making all that racket?

701
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,018
- Boy, that was scary.

702
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:42,854
But I guess it worked.

703
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:46,858
(Rothbart pants)

704
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:51,697
(tense music)

705
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,751
- Someone's been chewing.

706
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,003
Must be those rats again.

707
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,006
- Who's he calling a rat?

708
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:12,009
(drawbridge creaks)

709
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:23,437
- The sun is just about
to go down, Odette,

710
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,147
and the ball will begin.

711
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:28,275
I think I may just drop
in on that ball myself,

712
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,901
and see which of those princesses

713
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:32,070
young Siegfried decides to marry (laughs).

714
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:36,450
(Odette sobs)

715
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:45,167
- Oh, and after all I went through.

716
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,920
(gong chimes)

717
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:57,054
(\"Swan Lake\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky)

718
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:57,971
- [Siegfried] Odette.

719
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,102
- [Odette] Siegfried.

720
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,332
- [Rothbart] Have a
pleasant evening, Odette,

721
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:29,920
curl up with a good book or
play a few hands of solitaire.

722
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,340
I want you rested for your
wedding tomorrow (laughs).

723
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:38,345
- [Odette] Oh, Siegfried,
Prince Siegfried (sobs).

724
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:57,906
- [Margarita] Hans, Hans!

725
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:58,907
- Margarita.

726
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:02,536
Margarita.

727
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:08,291
- [Both] Oh!

728
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:11,211
(Hans' lips smack)

729
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,468
- Odette's in there all alone.

730
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:19,302
- [Margarita] I know.

731
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,847
- [Hans] The problem is how're
we gonna get that door open?

732
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,974
- Not by standing here talking about it.

733
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:27,853
What are you doing, Hans,

734
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,813
hurry up and help me with this thing.

735
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:30,647
- [Hans] Okay.

736
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:34,818
(both groan and grunt)

737
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,322
Whoa!

738
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:41,199
(wood clatters)

739
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,785
- My goodness, are you all right?

740
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:46,079
(door creaks)

741
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,874
- Oh, somebody's coming.

742
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:53,128
(\"Swan Lake\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky)

743
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:13,190
- May I now present
the Princess Catherine.

744
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,361
- Happy birthday, Prince Siegfried.

745
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,699
(Siegfried sighs)

746
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:23,533
Well.

747
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,703
(scoffs)

748
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,332
- [Siegfried Voiceover]
Odette, please, hurry.

749
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,667
- May I now present, Princess Rosanna.

750
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:39,424
- [Rosanna] Many happy returns
of the day, your highness.

751
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,052
- Huh?

752
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:06,284
Please, Odette.

753
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:07,327
- My name's Francine.

754
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:10,538
I've never been so
insulted in my entire life.

755
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:12,415
Daddy's gonna hear about this.

756
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:17,295
- And now my son, the time has come

757
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:19,589
for you to tell all of us assembled here

758
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,466
which one of these lovely princesses

759
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:23,176
you have decided to marry.

760
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:25,804
- And now, Mother, the time
has come for me to tell you

761
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,806
that I'm not going to marry
any of these princesses.

762
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,391
- (gasps) Siegfried.

763
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:31,685
- Listen, everybody, I'm
sorry to have to say this,

764
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:32,894
but the ball is over.

765
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:34,521
I'm sorry it had to end like this,

766
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,356
and that you lovely princesses had to come

767
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:37,607
all this way for nothing.

768
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,234
(princesses gasp)

769
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:41,027
You can all go home now.

770
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:43,321
(gasps)

771
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:46,491
(\"Swan Lake\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky)

772
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:47,867
Odette, I knew you'd come!

773
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,637
I knew all along that
now matter what happened

774
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,681
you wouldn't break your promise, Odette.

775
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:10,598
- [Odille] Odette?

776
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:11,933
My name is Odille.

777
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,311
- Odille?

778
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,645
- That's right.

779
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,189
Oh, prince, how could you forget my name?

780
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:20,150
- But last night, you said your name was--

781
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,277
- I'm sure I said my name is Odille

782
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:23,987
because that's what it is.

783
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,614
The moonlight must have
affected your hearing.

784
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:28,950
I just love what moonlight does to men.

785
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,411
- That must be it, but who cares?

786
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:33,705
It doesn't matter to me what your name is.

787
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:36,541
I'm just incredibly happy that
you came to the ball, Odille.

788
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:41,004
(tense music)

789
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:44,090
- Who is that mysterious
lady there dressed in black?

790
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,717
- I have never seen her.

791
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,302
She's lovely.

792
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,971
- Whoever she is, I'm glad
my son has finally found

793
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:51,973
a young woman he's interested in.

794
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:53,641
Have them begin the music now.

795
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,103
- Music, maestro!

796
00:55:57,103 --> 00:56:01,358
(\"Swan Lake\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky)

797

(Odette pants)

798
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:03,628
- Stop!

799
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,256
Where do you think you're going?

800
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,173
- [Hans] Oh, no.

801
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,341
- [Odette] Oh.

802
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:12,554
(tense music)

803
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:21,062
(\"Swan Lake\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky)

804
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:36,786
- [Hans] Ya ha!

805
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:37,620
- [Guard] Oh, no, rats!

806
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:41,374
- [Guard] Rats, rats,
oh, look it on my neck.

807
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:47,589
(Odette screams)

808
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,133
- What brings you here?

809
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,926
- [Both] Whoa!

810
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:54,679
- Well, now, as long as you are here,

811
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:56,639
I might as well show you something.

812
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:58,433
I think you'll be amused (chuckles).

813
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:11,446
Take a look, take a look, princess.

814
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,466
(laughs)

815
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:33,760
- [Siegfried] And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

816
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,847
princes and princesses, I
have an announcement to make.

817
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,349
(Odette sobs)

818
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,768
Today, the day that I have come of age,

819
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:44,187
I would like you all to
meet the woman I have chosen

820
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:47,106
to be my queen, Princess Odille.

821
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:48,191
(guests applaud)

822
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:52,654
(\"Swan Lake\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky)

823
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,155
- What?

824
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:56,324
- Oh, no, it can't be, it can't be.

825
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,912
- [Queen] Well, Siegfried, I
have no idea who this woman is,

826
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:03,414
but I will do nothing
to oppose this marriage

827
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:05,583
if you are sincerely in love with her.

828
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:07,085
Are you?

829
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:08,294
- Yes, of course, I am.

830
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:10,171
She's the only woman I have ever loved.

831
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:12,006
And I have vow to love Princess Odille

832
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,216
for the rest of my life.

833
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:17,345
(guests applaud)

834
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:25,436
(Rothbart laughs)

835
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:26,604
- [Odette] Oh.

836
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,161
- What?

837
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:45,039
Who are you, and how did
you get into my castle?

838
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:49,460
- (laughs) Just call me Dad,

839
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:52,547
now that you're planning to
marry my daughter, Odille.

840
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:53,965
- You mean, he's your father?

841
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,550
- I'm afraid, he is.

842
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,927
- You must be that evil
sorcerer, Rothbart.

843
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:01,389
- Very smart, now, Odette
belongs to me (laughs).

844
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:04,559
- But if that's Princess Odette,

845
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,019
who did I just propose to?

846
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:09,355
- Well, I told you my
name is Odille, didn't I?

847
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:10,273
(Siegfried gasps)

848
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,233
It's too late to be shocked, prince,

849
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:14,611
you've already given your
solemn oath to marry me

850
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:17,697
and to love me for the rest
of your ever-loving life.

851
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:18,781
- My princess!

852
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:21,659
- Oh.

853
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:26,539
- No, please forgive me, Odette.

854
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:30,418
- (laughs) Forget it, Siegfried,
she's my princess now.

855
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:33,713
Oh, oh, you're waking up at last, Odette.

856
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:36,591
- [Odette] Oh, farewell, Prince Siegfried.

857
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:37,759
- [Siegfried] Wait!

858
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,843
Come back, Odette!

859
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:40,178
- Get away, boy.

860
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:43,931
(guests gasp)

861
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:52,148
(Odette screams)

862
01:00:58,196 --> 01:00:59,864
- Odette, come back!

863
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,203
- [Odille] You're all mine, my love.

864
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:08,665
- [Rothbart] Nice work, Odille.

865
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:09,957
- [Siegfried] Odette!

866
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:11,876
(Rothbart laughs)

867
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:16,172
(\"Swan Lake\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky)

868
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,238
- [Queen] Siegfried, wait!

869
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:41,489
- [Siegfried] Mother!

870
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:42,949
- What chance can you possibly have

871
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:45,702
against that terrible sorcerer?

872
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,537
- Please, try to understand, Mother,

873
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,539
I have to go and rescue Odette.

874
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,083
It doesn't matter how
dangerous it might be.

875
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:54,335
- As of today, you're
the king of this country,

876
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:56,754
you can't just do anything as you please.

877
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:59,048
- Forgive me, goodbye.

878
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:00,800
- No, wait, you can't.

879
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,595
Siegfried, Siegfried!

880
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,182
(horse neighs)

881
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:09,016
- Yah!

882
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:18,985
- [Hans] Hurry!

883
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:55,188
(Odette sobs)

884
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,192
- Would you please stop
crying for one minute.

885
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:02,320
One of these days, you will
have to forget about Siegfried.

886
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,573
But I'm patient, I'm sure that
if I just wait long enough,

887
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:07,408
you'll finally give in and marry me.

888
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:09,076
(horse neighs)

889
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:12,538
- (gasps) Prince Siegfried.
- Who, who?

890
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:16,334
(grunts) That little runt.

891
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:17,460
I've had enough of him.

892
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:22,006
Where is he?

893
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:25,718
(tense music)

894
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,852
- Rothbart, fight like a man.

895
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:38,231
- Me, Prince Siegfried wants to fight me?

896
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,525
- I'll fight you to
the death if I have to.

897
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,443
- Poor boy, perhaps you don't realize

898
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:46,447
that standing in front of you
is Rothbart the magnificent.

899
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:48,366
(speaks gibberish)

900
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:51,285
(Siegfried grunts)

901
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,885
- Please don't let him
kill you, Siegfried.

902
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:08,719
- Odette!

903
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,180
- Run away, Siegfried.

904
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,766
If you try to fight
Rothbart, he will kill you.

905
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:17,728
- Don't worry, blondie,
Daddy won't kill him,

906
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:19,480
he'll just chase him away.

907
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,190
Isn't that right, Daddy?

908
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:24,026
- Mm hmm, that's right.

909
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:27,446
How can I kill any man who
promised to love my daughter?

910
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:29,657
And why would I want to
go and deprive myself

911
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:32,118
of such an outstanding son-in-law?

912
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,536
- You better watch out, Daddy,

913
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,746
your little lovebird's flown the coop.

914
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:36,581
- What?

915
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:38,457
Odette!

916
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:44,130
- [Hans] There goes the prince.

917
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,798
- [Margarita] Hurry.

918
01:04:49,802 --> 01:04:52,471
- [Rothbart] Where is
she, which way id she go?

919
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:00,062
(growls)

920
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:09,113
If you take one more step, Odette,

921
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:12,450
you're going to be very sorry
you ever met that prince.

922
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:15,077
- You'd better get out of here, Siegfried.

923
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,537
- No, stand back.

924
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:18,247
It's time somebody got
rid of this Rothbart

925
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:19,916
once and for all, Odette.

926
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:25,129
- (laughs) Don't push
your luck, little prince.

927
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:26,088
I may lose my patience and kill you

928
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:29,508
even if you are engaged to my daughter.

929
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:32,428
(speaks gibberish)

930
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:41,771
- [Odette] Be careful!

931
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:42,605
- Nice try.

932
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:47,902
But let's be fair.

933
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:52,114
(both grunt and groan)

934
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:00,748
- Help him, Hans.

935
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:01,999
If you really want to marry me,

936
01:06:01,999 --> 01:06:04,126
then do something to help the prince.

937
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,170
- Hmm, I will.

938
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,799
- But be careful, Hans.

939
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,520
- You'd better go back to
your castle now, prince,

940
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,021
while you still can.

941
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:28,818
(Hans grunts)

942
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,075
You miserable swill.

943
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:40,121
What are you doing here?

944
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:42,623
(Hans groans)

945
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:49,046
- Hans, Hans, Hans, my poor Hans.

946
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:57,805
- [Odille] Those two haven't
learned their lesson yet.

947
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:03,894
- They must think me pretty stupid.

948
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:07,648
- [Siegfried] Ah!

949
01:07:07,648 --> 01:07:09,942
- Let's come to an
understanding, Siegfried.

950
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:11,318
I'm a reasonable man.

951
01:07:11,318 --> 01:07:12,903
You agree to marry my daughter,

952
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:14,822
I won't squash you like a bug.

953
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:16,157
- I'll never marry your daughter.

954
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:17,867
Do you hear me, never!

955
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:20,411
- (gasps) Well, of all the nerve.

956
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:21,954
I don't want him anymore.

957
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:23,414
Go ahead and kill him, Daddy.

958
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:26,167
- [Rothbart] You don't have
to ask me twice, my sweet.

959
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:27,418
Now comes the fun part.

960
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:31,672
(speaks gibberish)

961
01:07:34,508 --> 01:07:36,218
(Siegfried groans)

962
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:38,471
- [Odette] Oh, no, hold on.

963
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:43,017
(Siegfried groans)

964
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,855
(Siegfried screams)

965
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:50,691
(Rothbart laughs)

966
01:07:52,526 --> 01:07:53,611
(Odette gasps)

967
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:55,821
- Watch me now, prince.

968
01:07:55,821 --> 01:07:58,532
- [Odette] Stop, you can't kill him.

969
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:02,495
- So you want him to live?

970
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:03,746
- Please, don't kill him.

971
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:07,583
- Finish him off.

972
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:09,001
- Oh, I'll let him live, Odette,

973
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:12,463
if you'll accept my
humble offer of marriage.

974
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:14,256
Everything has it's price.

975
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:17,218
Now, have you fallen in love
with me all of a sudden?

976
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:19,178
Or do you want me to ask more nicely?

977
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:21,931
You always were the romantic, weren't you?

978
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,058
Oh, most beautiful of princesses,

979
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,434
from the bottom of my heart,

980
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:27,186
I humbly beg you to be mine.

981
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:28,479
- You can't say yes.

982
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:32,024
Forget about me, don't
give in to this monster.

983
01:08:32,024 --> 01:08:33,234
I'm not worth it.

984
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,653
- It's up to you now.

985
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:37,738
Please, shall I put him out of his misery?

986
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:39,573
- [Odette] Wait!

987
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:41,408
- Don't try to stop him.

988
01:08:41,408 --> 01:08:43,786
- Well, please give me
your answer, princess,

989
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,371
I haven't got all day.

990
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:46,622
Will you love me forever,

991
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:49,792
or will you let Siegfried die like a rat?

992
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:53,337
- Odette, let him kill me,
my life doesn't matter.

993
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:55,965
- [Rothbart] Give me your
answer, Odette, I'm waiting.

994
01:08:57,716 --> 01:09:00,427
- I promise that I will
love you, Rothbart,

995
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:02,096
for the rest of my life.

996
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:03,806
- No, Odette, ah!

997
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:04,849
- No, no, you must--

998
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:05,683
- [Siegfried] Ah!

999
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:07,309
(Rothbart screams)

1000
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:10,062
(Odille screams)

1001
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:18,195
- [Rothbart] Ah, Odille, help me!

1002
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:20,281
(Odille screams)

1003

(\"Swan Lake\" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky)

1004
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:02,406
- [Adolf] Oh,

1005
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:04,325
huh?

1006
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:31,518
- Hip hip hooray!

1007
01:10:32,436 --> 01:10:34,271
- [Margarita] Yeah!

1008
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:35,272
- [Hans] Ah.

1009
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:03,300
- (groans) Siegfried.

1010
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:12,309
(gasps)

1011
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:19,900
(sighs)

1012
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:20,776
- You're alive!

1013
01:11:22,194 --> 01:11:23,988
- [Odette] Siegfried.

1014
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:25,030
- [Siegfried] Odette.

1015
01:11:27,324 --> 01:11:28,450
- Rothbart's magic was no match

1016
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,869
for the love between Siegfried an Odette.

1017
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:33,247
Listen, Hans, will you promise to love me

1018
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:36,834
as much as the prince loves
Odette, forever and ever?

1019
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:37,960
- [Hans] Mm hmm.

1020
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,545
- [Margarita] Mwah.
