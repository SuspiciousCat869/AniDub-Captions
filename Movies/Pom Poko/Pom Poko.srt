<i>Yes, it's true we raccoons like to live near humans.</i>

9
00:00:51,502 --> 00:00:54,821
<i>But not to steal their food.
Let me clear that up right now.</i>

10
00:00:55,262 --> 00:00:58,658
<i>The reason we live by humans
is because humans live on farms.</i>

11
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:02,898
<i>And where there are farms there are
fogs and grass hoppers and mice and moles.</i>

12
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:05,175
<i>All sorts of things for raccoons to eat.</i>

13
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,821
<i>And then there's all those fruits that fall off the trees,</i>

14
00:01:09,122 --> 00:01:10,468
<i>which humans won't touch.</i>

15
00:01:10,997 --> 00:01:16,359
<i>It's just so much better for us to live near
a farm than, say, in some mountain highlands.</i>

16
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:22,624
<i>Then last spring this farmhouse was
abandoned, no one seemed to be coming back.</i>

17
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,214
<i>So, we decided to move in.</i>

18
00:01:27,195 --> 00:01:28,501
<i>The house was just a dream.</i>

19
00:01:28,526 --> 00:01:33,877
<i>It was a lovely level two bedroom with
a loft, garden, a huge yard for the kids.</i>

20
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,563
<i>Oh, we spent a glorious year living there.</i>

21
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:37,922
<i>But then...</i>

22
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,686
<i>Uh, we raccoons generally get along well with each other.</i>

23
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,735
<i>But um, all of a sudden things were different.</i>

24
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,275
<i>I go out looking for food.</i>

25
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,292
<i>And no matter where I went there'd be a raccoon there.</i>

26
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:06,453
<i>And more kept showing up, and then fights started
breaking out over food and burrows, until one day...</i>

27
00:02:09,493 --> 00:02:12,317
<i>Autumn, year 31, of the Pom Poko era,</i>

28
00:02:12,731 --> 00:02:18,442
<i>so many raccoons have been displaced from their
homes in Tama Hills, that alliances begin to form.</i>

29
00:02:18,676 --> 00:02:23,935
<i>Finally, tensions rose so high that
the opposing alliances engaged in battle.</i>

30
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:52,442
<i>The leader of the red army was Gonta
young hotheaded, a raccoon of action.</i>

31
00:02:52,836 --> 00:02:58,735
<i>The blue army was led by Seizaemon older less
quick to strike, but still, a formidable opponent.</i>

32
00:03:01,007 --> 00:03:07,872
<i>Although not a widely known fact, raccoons do walk
on two legs when humans aren't around as you see here.</i>

33
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,252
<i>Each side eagerly pummeled the other.</i>

34
00:04:08,277 --> 00:04:10,433
<i>But their battle was soon interrupted.</i>

<i>Moved by Oroku's words, the raccoons ceased
fighting to have a look at the situation for themselves.</i>

53
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,014
<i>They were stunned.</i>

54
00:05:13,516 --> 00:05:15,533
<i>The destruction stretch for miles.</i>

55
00:05:15,558 --> 00:05:18,362
<i>The situation was far worse than they realized.</i>

56
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:21,461
Don't you see this is madness.

57
00:05:21,796 --> 00:05:24,340
This is not the time for us to be fighting each other.

58
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:32,366
<i>In the 1960s, Japan was entering
golden age of economic growth,</i>

59
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,908
<i>and the demand for housing in and around Tokyo exploded.</i>

60
00:05:36,595 --> 00:05:43,045
<i>Developers snapped up giant tracks of farm land
and forest, creating a maze of poorly planned suburbs.</i>

61
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:50,581
<i>Then in 1967 the government decided to build a
completely new suburb with maximum residential potential.</i>

62
00:05:50,838 --> 00:05:52,989
<i>They called the development New Tama.</i>

63
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:58,809
<i>The suburb would house over 300,000
people in less than 12 square miles of land.</i>

64
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:06,206
<i>To do so, they needed to clear forests, level
mountains, demolish farms and fill in valleys.</i>

65
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:09,874
<i>It was the largest urban development project in history,</i>

66
00:06:10,361 --> 00:06:14,152
<i>all to be built in the raccoons, Tama Hills.</i>

67
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:20,587
<i>Uh, clearly, we raccoons
underestimated these humans somehow.</i>

68
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,696
<i>In the past we had always thought
that humans were animals just like us.</i>

69
00:06:24,754 --> 00:06:28,186
<i>But, you know, now we realized
that these guys were powerful.</i>

70
00:06:28,507 --> 00:06:30,882
<i>Maybe as powerful as "the Gods."</i>

71
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:45,344
<i>In response to the situation, raccoons throughout the
region secretly gather at the abandoned Manpooku Temple,</i>

72
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:48,031
<i>which was hidden deep in the forests of Tama Hills.</i>

73
00:06:48,345 --> 00:06:54,090
<i>A motion was made that Osho, the temple's 105 year
old resident raccoon be the chairman of the meeting.</i>

74
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,782
<i>The motion was approved unanimously.</i>

75
00:06:57,869 --> 00:07:01,850
So, due to the severity of the current situation,

76
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:05,145
we must forgo our natural
tendency to sleep during the day,

77
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:09,365
and be prepared to take action
whenever necessary, be it day or night.

78
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:13,116
<i>Despite the fact that raccoons have
trouble taking anything seriously,</i>

79
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,516
<i>they manage to agree to stop the development.</i>

80
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:18,751
The motion passes and today's meeting is adjourned.

81
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,290
<i>The raccoons quickly disbanded leaving it to
the elders to formulate the course of action.</i>

82
00:07:25,707 --> 00:07:29,409
<i>The elders adopted a five year
program with two objectives.</i>

83
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:31,844
<i>One: Research and monitored humans.</i>

84
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:36,080
<i>And two: Revive the ancient raccoon art of transformation.</i>

85
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:42,512
<i>Next they decided to bring in the masters of
transformation from Sado and Shikoku Islands.</i>

86
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,974
<i>Osho ask the elders, "Who will volunteer to go."</i>

87
00:07:48,128 --> 00:07:53,220
<i>Although the plan was superb, the journey
was long and raccoons are notoriously lazy.</i>

88
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:55,537
<i>All the elders pretended to be asleep.</i>

89
00:07:55,825 --> 00:08:00,344
Well, let's wait for the young ones to
go up... then they can make the journey.

90
00:08:02,438 --> 00:08:03,804
Hamburgers!

91
00:08:05,796 --> 00:08:11,070
<i>The hamburgers which were provided to facilitate
discussion were enthusiastically received.</i>

92
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,409
<i>The discussion however immediately concluded.</i>

93
00:08:20,523 --> 00:08:21,359
Pom!

94
00:08:24,622 --> 00:08:29,264
<i>The raccoons began step one of the
five year program the very next day.</i>

95
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,900
Dad, the signs say no dumping.

96
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:39,155
<i>The best way to research and monitor
humans they concluded was to watch TV.</i>

97
00:08:40,835 --> 00:08:46,597
<i>The situated the television in the main hall of Manpooku
Temple which became the group's official headquarters.</i>

98
00:08:48,813 --> 00:08:49,698
Good evening.

99
00:08:50,307 --> 00:08:51,366
Good evening.

100
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:55,067
<i>The arrival of the television had an unexpected results.</i>

101
00:08:56,473 --> 00:09:03,592
<i>Dozens of raccoons crowded into the temple, watched TV
all day, and lost all desire to accomplish anything else.</i>

102
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:15,448
To learn to transform you must achieve
the highest degree of mental concentration.

103
00:09:15,827 --> 00:09:19,477
So you can rearrange the very
order of your cells in an instant.

104
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:25,428
Lesser forms of transformation such as changing
color can be achieved by chameleon for example.

105
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:31,343
But the true art of transforming can own be
practice by foxes, raccoons and a few cats.

106
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:34,073
Gonta!

107
00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:38,495
The fact that you were able to
change your appearance like that...

108
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:42,507
... means you've already mastered the
rudimentary techniques of transformation.

109
00:09:43,277 --> 00:09:45,713
This is something all of you will be able to do.

110
00:09:46,014 --> 00:09:48,545
If you pay attention and practice!

111
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:50,176
At least in theory.

112
00:09:52,255 --> 00:09:54,946
To begin the lesson, I will do a demonstration.

113
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,841
Aren't you supposed to put a leaf on your head?

114
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:00,911
Leafs are only for amateurs.

115
00:10:09,555 --> 00:10:11,020
Haven't done that in a while.

116
00:10:11,676 --> 00:10:14,010
1, 2, 3, pom pom.

117
00:10:15,122 --> 00:10:16,962
<i>With Oroku guiding the way,</i>

118
00:10:17,109 --> 00:10:22,580
<i>the raccoons made steady progress toward
their goal of reviving the art of transformation.</i>

119
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:28,269
<i>The students were eager and
enthusiastic, and some were quite talented.</i>

120
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:29,816
Well done, Shoukichi!

121
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,923
<i>I've been fascinated with humans
ever since I was a little cub.</i>

122
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:49,795
<i>I knew that according to raccoon
laws, I wasn't supposed to go near them.</i>

123
00:10:49,988 --> 00:10:52,061
<i>But that just made me even more curious.</i>

124
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,769
<i>And my dad always encouraged me.</i>

125
00:10:54,348 --> 00:10:58,748
<i>He said that, "Careful observation of humans
and their ways was the key to transforming,"</i>

126
00:10:58,954 --> 00:11:01,243
<i>and getting near the humans was essential.</i>

127
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:02,315
Over here!

128
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:04,011
My turn, catch!

129
00:11:04,906 --> 00:11:05,867
Hey guys.

130
00:11:05,918 --> 00:11:06,852
Keep it going.

131
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,057
Goal!

132
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,824
<i>I guess that's why I'm a bit ahead of the curve today.</i>

133
00:11:22,593 --> 00:11:25,844
<i>Unfortunately, not all the students were talented.</i>

134
00:11:26,126 --> 00:11:28,477
<i>Some of them in fact were quite pathetic.</i>

135
00:11:33,522 --> 00:11:39,028
<i>To become adept at transforming requires
technique and extreme physical and mental discipline.</i>

136
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:43,719
<i>Unlike foxes who are known for being
clever, raccoons are known for being lazy.</i>

137
00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:48,180
<i>And those raccoons who weren't gifted
transformers were easily distracted.</i>

138
00:11:48,205 --> 00:11:49,266
Hey there!

139
00:11:56,195 --> 00:11:57,381

00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,471
He noticed a pine tree which somehow
appeared different from what he had remember.

149
00:12:25,117 --> 00:12:27,553
This distracted the man as very odd.

150
00:12:27,736 --> 00:12:31,625
So, he said aloud, "There's never been a
branch on that side of the tree before."

151
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:35,811
And lo and behold the branch switched sides.

152
00:12:35,944 --> 00:12:39,226
And then the man thought that look wrong too.

153
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:43,665
"That's not right there were
branches on both sides, I'm sure of it."

154
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:46,221
And sure enough another branch appeared.

155
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:49,331
Then all of a sudden there was a large crash.

156
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:51,809
What do you think had fallen out of the tree?

157
00:12:51,853 --> 00:12:52,896
A raccoon!

158
00:12:53,311 --> 00:12:54,300
That's right.

159
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:56,904
And why do you think he fell? Gonta.

160
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:59,950
He was a loser. I wouldn't have fallen.

161
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:02,416
Good answer, thank you, Gonta.

162
00:13:02,527 --> 00:13:05,975
Sasuke, why do you think the raccoon fell from the tree?

163
00:13:06,196 --> 00:13:08,658
He had to use both of his arms to make two branches.

164
00:13:09,112 --> 00:13:13,739
Very good. And what lesson should
we learn from this story. Shoukichi?

165
00:13:14,206 --> 00:13:18,198
That were overly accommodating
towards human. We're too eager to please.

166
00:13:18,678 --> 00:13:22,086
That's right. We raccoons are to good-natured.

167
00:13:22,477 --> 00:13:25,169
We shouldn't, … try so hard to please.

168
00:13:25,448 --> 00:13:29,012
This is where we all go wrong. Do you understand?

169
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,750
Yes, master...

170
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:32,836
So, what do you do if you hear,

171
00:13:32,903 --> 00:13:37,995
♪ Mr. Raccoon, Mr. Raccoon,
won't you sing with me somehow? ♪

172
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,890
♪ No we can't. We have to study now.  ♪

173
00:13:42,182 --> 00:13:44,928
You see! All of you just fell for that.

174
00:13:45,232 --> 00:13:46,876
Don't be so gullible.

175
00:14:02,498 --> 00:14:07,155
<i>The raccoons tried to stay focused on
researching humans and learning to transform.</i>

176
00:14:07,562 --> 00:14:12,906
<i>But once winter had ended, the flowers and
trees were blossoming and love was in the air.</i>

177
00:14:14,004 --> 00:14:17,265
<i>Recalling Oroku warning not to have any more cubs.</i>

178
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:23,785
<i>The raccoons decided to refrain from romance.
until their battle for Tama Hills was won.</i>

179
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:30,566
<i>It was left up to the females
to fend off the male's advances.</i>

180
00:14:31,028 --> 00:14:33,638
<i>The females were remarkably successful.</i>

181
00:14:38,331 --> 00:14:42,306
<i>Meanwhile, the New Tama development
project was picking up steam.</i>

182
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:47,639
<i>Forests were cleared the earth was leveled
and the construction zone grew bigger every day.</i>

183
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:52,586
<i>The raccoons watched with anger and
sadness as their forests were stripped bare.</i>

184
00:14:53,345 --> 00:14:56,740
♪ Hey there Post Man, what did you drop? ♪

185
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:03,210
<i>Since the females were now free from the duty of raising
cubs, they too began to try their hand at transforming.</i>

186
00:15:03,878 --> 00:15:07,548
<i>When the male's tried to transform into women or children,</i>

187
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:10,672
<i>the results were neither convincing nor pleasant.</i>

188
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:15,839
<i>But with the females participating, the males
followed their example and quickly improved.</i>

189
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:20,146
<i>Naturally the females soon wanted to
try their hand at transformed into men:</i>

190
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:22,970
<i>they experienced similar problems.</i>

191
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:27,904
Oh, ah, I would like all the male's
to stay after class today please.

192
00:15:28,831 --> 00:15:34,225
<i>Osho decided it was time to let the
male raccoons in on a little secret.</i>

193
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:41,251
Now then, notice this fine red
blanket we're all sitting on.

194
00:15:42,426 --> 00:15:44,310
Want to know what it is?

195
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:45,884
My raccoon pouch.

196
00:15:46,492 --> 00:15:50,678
It's 150 square feet and it retracts quite nicely. Watch.

197
00:16:02,158 --> 00:16:07,591
<i>Finally, it was time for the transforming
students to test their skills in the real world.</i>

198
00:16:08,146 --> 00:16:11,218
<i>The exercise was conducted
like a driver's training lesson.</i>

199
00:16:11,623 --> 00:16:16,313
<i>The students ventured into the streets of
Tokyo, while accompanied by advanced instructors...</i>

200
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,875
<i>who could help out in case of emergency.</i>

201
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:29,882
Sasuke, Sasuke...

202
00:16:32,522 --> 00:16:33,355
Get over here!

203
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,860
Sasuke...

204
00:16:35,901 --> 00:16:36,827
Come on!

205
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:56,048
<i>Transforming requires extraordinary amounts
of energy, especially when assuming human form.</i>

206
00:16:58,832 --> 00:17:04,529
<i>The dark circles or masks commonly seen around
raccoons' eyes are the results are sheer fatigue.</i>

207
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:11,170
<i>Even the most experienced raccoons carry pick-me-ups so
they can replenish their strength at a moment's notice.</i>

208
00:17:11,437 --> 00:17:14,680
<i>Even so, if their pick-me-up isn't fast acting enough,</i>

209
00:17:14,711 --> 00:17:19,994
<i>out pops the fur, then the tail, and within
seconds the raccoon is back to his original form.</i>

210
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,775
<i>The recent rise in popularity
of fast acting energy drinks...</i>

211
00:17:23,965 --> 00:17:27,617
<i>is almost entirely due to the
needs of transforming raccoons.</i>

212
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:33,919
<i>To graduate from basic training the
students had to pass one final test.</i>

213
00:17:34,244 --> 00:17:39,541
<i>Each was required to go out into the world and
earn at least 10 dollars through honest labor.</i>

214
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:40,781
Replacement.

215
00:17:40,914 --> 00:17:44,684
<i>Some raccoons work in teams and took
turns impersonating the same human.</i>

216
00:17:44,709 --> 00:17:45,424
Are you all right?

217
00:17:45,449 --> 00:17:48,688
<i>One raccoon posed as a monk and collected donations.</i>

218
00:17:48,961 --> 00:17:53,028
<i>One female work in a bar but
spent all her money on energy drinks.</i>

219
00:17:53,528 --> 00:17:56,268
<i>One raccoon hit the jackpot at the Pachinko Parlor.</i>

220
00:17:56,869 --> 00:18:01,814
<i>One lazy raccoon broke into a donation
box but all he found were few pennies.</i>

221
00:18:02,321 --> 00:18:07,358
<i>Rather than show up empty handed he transformed
a pile of leaves into a pile of dollar bills.</i>

222
00:18:09,537 --> 00:18:14,163
When I told you to go out into the world and
make some money I did not mean it literally.

223
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:25,901
<i>Soon after finishing the test, Gonta
received an urgent report from home.</i>

224
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:29,601
<i>He raced through the forests to
witness the devastation for himself.</i>

225
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:32,444
<i>The construction had reached his childhood home.</i>

226
00:18:33,003 --> 00:18:34,834
<i>Gonta went mad with grief.</i>

227
00:18:38,593 --> 00:18:43,705
<i>He hurried back to headquarters and forced Osho
to call a meeting of the elders where he announced:</i>

228
00:18:44,108 --> 00:18:47,438
<i>"Change of plans we began attacking the humans NOW!"</i>

229
00:18:48,106 --> 00:18:50,204
I am completely opposed to that.

230
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,137
Why is that?

231
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:52,700
It's way too soon.

232
00:18:52,793 --> 00:18:55,309
We're still in the first year of our five-year plan.

233
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:57,325
We've all completed basic training.

234
00:18:57,812 --> 00:18:59,378
Let's put our skills to work.

235
00:18:59,624 --> 00:19:01,762
Oroku, what you think?

236
00:19:02,651 --> 00:19:05,654
Are your transforming students ready for battle?

237
00:19:05,732 --> 00:19:09,254
It's true they've mastered the basic techniques but...

238
00:19:09,688 --> 00:19:10,626
But what?

239
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,365
They need practice.

240
00:19:13,181 --> 00:19:16,218
Even the smallest mistake and
our secret will be discovered.

241
00:19:16,308 --> 00:19:17,837
One question, Gonta.

242
00:19:19,088 --> 00:19:25,768
I think that your anger over what happened to
your childhood home might be clouding your judgment.

243
00:19:26,928 --> 00:19:30,424
No, my judgment is not clouded in the least.

244
00:19:30,846 --> 00:19:33,181
This action will benefit all of you.

245
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,636
I guarantee it.

246
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:37,174
Of course, his judgment is clouded.

247
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:42,782
Don't forget, it wasn't long ago that Gonta
was trying to take over some of our territories.

248
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:47,064
Shut up! We raccoons from my part of
the woods will attack with or without you.

249
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:50,483
If Gonta's going to risk his
life then I'm going to help him.

250
00:19:50,508 --> 00:19:52,113
Are you sure, Shoukichi?

251
00:19:52,142 --> 00:19:53,947
Shoukichi, thank you.

252
00:19:55,272 --> 00:19:56,263
So there!

253
00:19:56,732 --> 00:19:59,981
You can stop us now. We're off to fight some humans.

254
00:20:00,006 --> 00:20:01,306
Not so fast!

255
00:20:02,363 --> 00:20:04,208
You can stop us!

256
00:20:05,074 --> 00:20:09,384
Pay attention! I have one final
piece of advice to give to you.

257
00:20:12,623 --> 00:20:18,769
If the humans catch you transforming, there is
a trick that you can use to protect our secret.

258
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:21,777
So, uh, what is it?

259
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:25,253
Pretend that you're a dead fox.

260
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:30,275
<i>Summer, year 32 of the Pom Poko era,</i>

261
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,560
<i>with Gonta in charge 10 young raccoons
put their new transforming skills to work,</i>

262
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:38,823
<i> and executed a surprise attack against the humans.</i>

263
00:20:39,425 --> 00:20:41,386
<i>The battle has finally begun.</i>

264
00:20:53,756 --> 00:20:54,419
Here they come!

265
00:20:54,444 --> 00:20:55,090
Ready!

266
00:20:59,948 --> 00:21:03,728
All right! This way! This way! This way!

267
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:04,749
Now!

268
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:11,032
We did it! Yay!

269
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:00,689
Disaster struck today, at the New Tama development site,

270
00:22:01,025 --> 00:22:06,942
at approximately 2:30 in the afternoon, a
series of bizarre accidents killed three workers.

271
00:22:07,168 --> 00:22:11,483
and destroyed a section of a residential
complex which was under construction.

272
00:22:11,803 --> 00:22:17,238
Police suspect that the accidents were caused by
reduced visibility and soil erosion from heavy rains.

273
00:22:17,527 --> 00:22:21,472
but the seriousness of the accidents and
the fact that they occurred simultaneously...

274
00:22:21,654 --> 00:22:24,474
is causing local residents to express some concern.

275
00:22:24,936 --> 00:22:28,703
many citizens believe there are fundamental
problems with the New Tama project.

276
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:31,926
and they requested that the development plan be reviewed.

277
00:22:35,525 --> 00:22:37,292
Hold on everyone.

278
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,241
This isn't a time for celebration.

279
00:22:40,516 --> 00:22:42,658
Three humans died because of us.

280
00:22:42,683 --> 00:22:47,739
Shouldn't we be paying our respects to those
poor people who are victims of this operation.

281
00:22:47,948 --> 00:22:49,798
Well, I have to agree with Osho.

282
00:22:50,165 --> 00:22:53,925
Raccoons, we should have a moment of
silence for the unfortunate victims.

283
00:22:54,016 --> 00:22:56,222
And then, right after that, we can celebrate.

284
00:22:59,351 --> 00:23:00,560
All pray.

285
00:23:04,347 --> 00:23:07,282
I'd like to say a prayer for
the victims of this operation.

286
00:23:07,562 --> 00:23:11,311
We wish that we could save our
forests without harming any humans.

287
00:23:11,394 --> 00:23:15,784
That was never our intention, but
our forest is near and dear to us...

288
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:21,198
We save our forest! We save our forest!

289
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:24,379
We saved our forests...

290
00:23:53,094 --> 00:23:54,961
Hey, it's Gonta!

291
00:23:56,993 --> 00:24:00,127
You are my hero!

292
00:24:03,078 --> 00:24:05,072
Hey, you did it, Shoukichi.

293
00:24:06,928 --> 00:24:13,055
Nice work Gonta! You youngsters have brought back
hope to this old heart of mine. Well done, son. Well done.

294
00:24:13,488 --> 00:24:16,590
Well done? We're not done. That was just practice.

295
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:19,608
Raccoons, this war has just begun.

296
00:24:20,062 --> 00:24:22,431
We will not stop attacking until we have battered...

297
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:25,276
pulverize, and squeezed to death...

298
00:24:25,434 --> 00:24:27,650
every last human in Tama Hills.

299
00:24:27,858 --> 00:24:30,257
Shoukichi, you should say something too.

300
00:24:30,423 --> 00:24:32,264
And then we'll plant fruit trees.

301
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:36,099
And in a few years all have to do is eat fruit.

302
00:24:45,111 --> 00:24:47,364
Let's slaughter some humans.

303
00:24:47,634 --> 00:24:49,583
Kick out humans!

304
00:24:49,715 --> 00:24:55,717
OK, OK will beat up some more humans, but
first we need to have a little victory celebration.

305
00:24:56,174 --> 00:24:58,504
Yeah, but there's one thing I'm worried about.

306
00:24:59,201 --> 00:25:00,286
What now?

307
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,145
Do we really wanna get rid of all of the humans.

308
00:25:04,289 --> 00:25:05,264
Of course we do.

309
00:25:05,442 --> 00:25:08,827
Can we just a few of them live
around here, like the old days.

310
00:25:08,852 --> 00:25:12,960
No way! The world is crawling with humans, like roaches.

311
00:25:13,098 --> 00:25:15,499
We need to destroy as many as we can.

312
00:25:15,772 --> 00:25:19,994
I see your point, but you know
what? I can't stand humans either,

313
00:25:20,741 --> 00:25:24,683
although some of them are not so
bad, but mostly I hate their guts.

314
00:25:26,121 --> 00:25:26,930
It's just that...

315
00:25:27,514 --> 00:25:28,622
What, Ponkichi?

316
00:25:29,233 --> 00:25:32,895
It's just that, if we get rid
of all the humans then that means:

317
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:34,912
we'll never eat tempura again.

318
00:25:36,465 --> 00:25:37,571
Or beef jerky.

319
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:39,754
Or popcorn.

320
00:25:39,784 --> 00:25:43,161
Hamburgers, Doughnuts, potato chips...

321
00:25:43,252 --> 00:25:44,891
pepperoni pizza...

322
00:25:45,053 --> 00:25:46,317
chicken wings!

323
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,588
Oh, I can taste it.

324
00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:53,772
Hum, so then, do you think it would be all
right if we kept a few humans around, Gonta?

325
00:25:55,223 --> 00:25:56,593
We have no choice.

326
00:25:58,726 --> 00:26:01,583
A good decision by Gonta yet again!

327
00:26:07,637 --> 00:26:10,616
♪ Shine, shine, shine on Gonta. ♪

328
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:13,537
♪ Pom pom-pom pom pom pom-pom-pom. ♪

329
00:26:13,562 --> 00:26:16,777
♪ You show the world what we can do. ♪

330
00:26:16,802 --> 00:26:19,541
♪ Why don't we tell you too. ♪

331
00:26:19,747 --> 00:26:22,786
♪ All the kids are cheering for you. ♪

332
00:26:22,864 --> 00:26:25,761
♪ That's the truth: we adore you. ♪

333
00:26:25,786 --> 00:26:26,773
♪ Hail to Gonta ♪

334
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:32,655
Nevertheless, a government spokesman stressed that
the people of Tokyo are in such desperate need of...

335
00:26:32,682 --> 00:26:37,838
living accommodations that the New Tama
development project will not be delayed,

336
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:40,111
despite today's tragic accidents.

337
00:26:45,557 --> 00:26:48,556
<i>It was needles to say an unfortunate accident.</i>

338
00:26:49,051 --> 00:26:52,620
<i>Gonta, the mastermind behind the
dangerous attacks against the humans...</i>

339
00:26:52,665 --> 00:26:57,805
<i>now suffered multiple fractured and internal
injuries that would take nearly a year to heal.</i>

340
00:27:00,797 --> 00:27:03,611
<i>The situation plunged the raccoons into depression.</i>

341
00:27:03,868 --> 00:27:07,364
<i>But the raccoons soon realized their
attack had not been a complete waste.</i>

342
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:12,267
<i>Some of the human who sold their land to the
New Tama developers were highly superstitious.</i>

343
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:17,295
I think it was a bad idea to move those
shrines just to make way for more housing.

344
00:27:17,515 --> 00:27:18,541
Can you elaborate?

345
00:27:19,143 --> 00:27:24,142
All those accidents. Maybe the
spirits were exacting their revenge.

346
00:27:24,349 --> 00:27:27,866
Weren't there many sacred objects
moved to make way for New Tama.

347
00:27:27,968 --> 00:27:30,972
Yes, there were dozens of them. That's what worries me.

348
00:27:30,997 --> 00:27:34,855
I asked the developers to hold the
proper ceremonies before moving them but...

349
00:27:35,346 --> 00:27:38,252
And what are your thoughts about the situation, professor?

350
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:44,437
Your basic spirit or deity is generally
associated with a certain location.

351
00:27:44,566 --> 00:27:47,785
If someone moves that spirit's shrine or statue,

352
00:27:47,976 --> 00:27:53,506
this spirit will become extremely agitated
and wreak havoc on those responsible.

353
00:27:54,253 --> 00:27:57,931
I'm sure if this is just the beginning of your problems.

354
00:28:00,194 --> 00:28:02,628
Maybe we can save Tama Hills after all.

355
00:28:06,817 --> 00:28:10,022
<i>Shoukichi immediately led the raccoons back into action.</i>

356
00:28:14,269 --> 00:28:19,971
<i>A man with land for sale in the section of Tama
Hills tour his property with two New Tama developers.</i>

357
00:28:20,363 --> 00:28:25,244
<i>To the landowner's surprise, he saw far more
sacred statues on his land than he remembered.</i>

358
00:28:25,512 --> 00:28:28,617
<i>He told the developers, "I better give this more thought".</i>

359
00:28:28,655 --> 00:28:31,433
<i>And he postponed signing the contract to sell his land.</i>

360
00:28:32,457 --> 00:28:34,969
<i>Meanwhile, in another section of Tama Hills,</i>

361
00:28:34,994 --> 00:28:38,544
<i>a priest was holding a ceremony
at the Shrine of the White Fox,</i>

362
00:28:38,575 --> 00:28:40,134
<i>which was slated to be moved.</i>

363
00:28:41,725 --> 00:28:42,042
Look!

364
00:28:42,067 --> 00:28:46,282
<i>A raccoon appeared on the roof
disguised as the white fox himself.</i>

365
00:28:48,266 --> 00:28:51,921
<i>The fox's eerie cry so overwhelmed
the ceremony participants...</i>

366
00:28:52,101 --> 00:28:55,328
<i>that the relocation proceedings
were brought to an immediate halt.</i>

367
00:28:56,377 --> 00:29:02,454
<i>The witnesses to the event bowed down to the fox
and vowed that its shrine would be left where it was.</i>

368
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,810
<i>The raccoons were on a roll.</i>

369
00:29:13,654 --> 00:29:19,480
<i>The raccoons played tricks on trespassers all
over the forests, each trying to outdo the other.</i>

370
00:29:21,496 --> 00:29:23,871
Go away.

371
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,680
Put that away.

372
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:34,193
Take it away!

373
00:29:37,312 --> 00:29:39,513
Pick up that tempura. You don't want to be a litter bug.

374
00:29:39,631 --> 00:29:41,129
Huh, tempura.

375
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:44,411
Leave it here.

376
00:29:49,024 --> 00:29:51,128
Uh, is everything okay here, miss?

377
00:29:56,334 --> 00:29:58,294
Miss, what happened?

378
00:30:08,585 --> 00:30:11,434
I have no face.

379
00:30:18,607 --> 00:30:20,911
Help! Somebody help!

380
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:49,752
I-I-I just saw a...

381
00:30:50,144 --> 00:30:50,919
A murder?

382
00:30:51,031 --> 00:30:52,344
N-N-No.

383
00:30:52,391 --> 00:30:53,239
It was a…!

384
00:30:53,264 --> 00:30:54,096
Not a murderer?

385
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,424
Well, that's too bad.

386
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:59,118
T-T-There was a woman.

387
00:30:59,178 --> 00:31:00,699
Was she a vampire?

388
00:31:00,724 --> 00:31:03,918
No no, she look like... aah...

389
00:31:03,943 --> 00:31:06,313
Was it something like this?

390
00:31:24,788 --> 00:31:31,162
Did she look something like this?

391
00:31:38,861 --> 00:31:42,184
<i>The raccoons took great pleasure
in frightening the humans,</i>

392
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:48,996
<i>and because raccoons have a weakness for throwing parties,
every time they scare a human, they had to celebrate.</i>

393
00:31:51,187 --> 00:31:54,151
<i>Gonta however, saw no reason to celebrate.</i>

394
00:31:54,585 --> 00:31:57,686
<i>Although his wife did all she
could to nurse him back to health,</i>

395
00:31:57,912 --> 00:32:01,301
<i>she could not soothe Gonta's
frustration for being out of the fight.</i>

396
00:32:01,762 --> 00:32:05,749
<i>Furthermore, Gonta thought his
fellow raccoons were acting like wimps.</i>

397
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,649
So, did either of you watch the news yesterday.

398
00:32:10,787 --> 00:32:13,301
They ran a piece entitled New Tama ghost town,

399
00:32:13,996 --> 00:32:16,454
featuring an interview with the policeman we scared.

400
00:32:16,713 --> 00:32:20,753
But the news crew started laughing
so hard that the police man ran off.

401
00:32:21,631 --> 00:32:22,270
It was a...

402
00:32:22,295 --> 00:32:23,658
What good did it do?!?

403
00:32:23,872 --> 00:32:27,622
You idiots! You think that will stop the developers?

404
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,260
Don't just frighten them!

405
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,153
We need to hurt them!

406
00:32:32,225 --> 00:32:33,934
Inflict some serious pain!

407
00:32:37,358 --> 00:32:38,401
Not again!

408
00:32:38,426 --> 00:32:41,995
<i>Just as Gonta predicted, the development did not stop.</i>

409
00:32:42,682 --> 00:32:44,490
<i>Rivers were paved with concrete.</i>

410
00:32:44,843 --> 00:32:47,274
<i>Forest trails became cement roads.</i>

411
00:32:47,563 --> 00:32:50,375
<i>Massive amounts of building materials were trucked in,</i>

412
00:32:50,487 --> 00:32:54,314
<i>and the construction of thousands
of New Tama Apartments got underway.</i>

413
00:32:55,004 --> 00:32:57,866
<i>The raccoons pranks however had not been forgotten.</i>

414
00:32:57,989 --> 00:33:01,146
<i>Tabloids and talk shows continued
to give nationwide coverage...</i>

415
00:33:01,171 --> 00:33:03,931
<i>to the strange occurrences at the construction sites.</i>

416
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:07,615
<i>The raccoons became more and
more confident of ultimate victory.</i>

417
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:12,119
<i>Autumn, year 32 of the Pom Poko era.</i>

418
00:33:12,271 --> 00:33:15,444
<i>by waving of a enthusiastic game of rock paper scissors,</i>

419
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:21,313
<i>the raccoons chose two representatives to seek out
and the world's most advanced Transformation Masters.</i>

420
00:33:26,322 --> 00:33:30,935
<i>The young and dashing Tamasaburou was
chosen to travel to the Island of Shikoku,</i>

421
00:33:31,361 --> 00:33:35,635
<i>while the husky and robust Bunta was
chosen to travel to the Island of Sado.</i>

422
00:33:36,749 --> 00:33:38,991
<i>So, on the night of the next full moon</i>

423
00:33:39,213 --> 00:33:44,294
<i>the two raccoons said their farewells and
set off on their long and dangerous journeys.</i>

424
00:34:01,163 --> 00:34:02,311
What's that smell?

425
00:34:04,587 --> 00:34:10,621
<i>While they waited for Bunta and Tamasaburou to return,
the raccoons continued haunting the construction sites.</i>

426
00:34:16,786 --> 00:34:23,205
<i>The raccoons seem to enjoy using their transforming skills
whether it helped prevent the New Tama development or not.</i>

427
00:34:38,648 --> 00:34:40,011
Out with demons!

428
00:34:40,117 --> 00:34:41,171
Daddy!

429
00:35:06,001 --> 00:35:07,609
I'm starting to get nervous.

430
00:35:07,634 --> 00:35:09,966
What if our little pranks aren't doing any good at all.

431
00:35:11,118 --> 00:35:15,230
What if the humans level the entire
forest, then where are we going to go?

432
00:35:16,767 --> 00:35:20,413
Maybe Gonta's right. The only
way to stop them is to get violent.

433
00:35:21,718 --> 00:35:26,011
I don't want to have to hurt anymore
humans. It just doesn't seem right to me.

434
00:35:27,482 --> 00:35:32,357
But what they won't stop. Then what. To be or not to be.

435
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,471
Kiyo?

436
00:35:48,754 --> 00:35:50,731
What's going on? Are you okay?

437
00:35:54,706 --> 00:35:56,175
Is something wrong with your neck?

438
00:35:57,684 --> 00:35:58,971
I was posing.

439
00:35:59,693 --> 00:36:02,045
I was hoping you'd tell me that I looked pretty.

440
00:36:02,255 --> 00:36:03,595
Oh, sorry.

441
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,587
Ow, now something is wrong with my neck.

442
00:36:06,951 --> 00:36:08,128
Well, you looked pretty.

443
00:36:08,651 --> 00:36:09,927
No. Too late.

444
00:36:10,022 --> 00:36:11,035
But I mean it.

445
00:36:14,704 --> 00:36:17,245
OK, but I could use some practice.

446
00:36:29,998 --> 00:36:32,027
Everyone loves that song, don't they?

447
00:36:32,126 --> 00:36:34,604
It's stupid, but I kinda like it too.

448
00:36:34,894 --> 00:36:36,742
Hey, do you like the hunter song?

449
00:36:38,072 --> 00:36:39,265
It's, pretty good.

450
00:36:39,483 --> 00:36:40,086
My dad used to…

451
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:43,975
♪ There once was a hunter who shot a big raccoon. ♪

452
00:36:44,086 --> 00:36:45,922
♪ He fried him up and ate him... ♪

453
00:36:47,185 --> 00:36:49,573
Did you know a hunter shot my grandfather?

454
00:36:51,213 --> 00:36:53,241
Sorry, I didn't know.

455
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:58,675
It's okay. My grandfather wasn't fried up and eaten.

456
00:36:58,949 --> 00:37:01,683
The hunter sold his pelt for a whole lot of money.

457
00:37:03,306 --> 00:37:05,228
Well, you got beautiful fur too.

458
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,317
Really!

459
00:37:06,606 --> 00:37:08,557
It's so nice of you to say that.

460
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:14,175
So, what about the hunter's song?

461
00:37:15,511 --> 00:37:19,780
Oh, my dad used to sing it to me, when I was just a cub.

462
00:37:20,147 --> 00:37:23,268
Sounds like your father was kinda strange.

463
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:24,519
He'd sing:

464
00:37:24,602 --> 00:37:27,661
♪ "Fried him up and ate him" ♪ really loudly.

465
00:37:27,832 --> 00:37:29,220
And then he'd give me a lecture.

466
00:37:29,922 --> 00:37:30,809
About what?

467
00:37:31,198 --> 00:37:33,700
He'd say, "Did you hear that, son?"

468
00:37:34,409 --> 00:37:39,017
"Even in children's nursery rhymes."
"Humans sing about how they love to shoot us."

469
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:40,366
"And then fry us up."

470
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:44,079
"Humans are sick cruel heartless beast
and don't you forget it, Shoukichi."

471
00:37:48,156 --> 00:37:49,927
Hey, wanna play ball with me?

472
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,009
Oh, sure. Right now?

473
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,287
Here, I'll make one.

474
00:37:58,706 --> 00:38:00,250
Hey, let me try that.

475
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:10,566
♪ Mr. Eike, where you from?
Higo, sir. Higo, that is where? ♪

476
00:38:10,816 --> 00:38:15,323
♪ Kumamoto, sir. Kumamoto, that is where? Senba, sir. ♪

477
00:38:15,785 --> 00:38:19,356
♪ A raccoon came from Senba and he wandered into town. ♪

478
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:20,651
♪ Along came a... ♪

479
00:38:20,724 --> 00:38:22,942
When are you going to do that plan you were talking about?

480
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,524
The Operation Twin Star?

481
00:38:25,193 --> 00:38:27,127
I don't think I'm going to do it anymore.

482
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:30,186
Why not? That was such a wonderful idea.

483
00:38:31,691 --> 00:38:33,678
Why don't we do it? Just you and me.

484
00:38:34,531 --> 00:38:35,739
Are you serious?

485
00:38:35,993 --> 00:38:37,963
Yeah. Don't you think I can do it?

486
00:38:38,301 --> 00:38:40,263
No it's not that. It's just...

487
00:38:40,867 --> 00:38:41,555
that I...

488
00:38:41,742 --> 00:38:45,889
Come on Shoukichi, I'm dying to do something.

489
00:38:46,214 --> 00:38:50,254
Then lets do it. I think that you and
I can be really frightening together.

490
00:38:51,064 --> 00:38:52,223
How sweet.

491
00:38:58,018 --> 00:38:59,061
Hello?

492
00:39:03,443 --> 00:39:06,323
Well, look what we have here.
What can we do for you girls?

493
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:11,815
Where is our home? We just got back from
our trip to the stars and our home's gone.

494
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,475
A trip to the stars?

495
00:39:13,753 --> 00:39:16,158
We travel from the red-eye of the Scorpion...

496
00:39:16,275 --> 00:39:18,682
to the swollen Cygnus’s great wings.

497
00:39:19,043 --> 00:39:21,365
around the coils of Hydra the Water Snake...

498
00:39:21,476 --> 00:39:23,656
to the forehead of the Little Bear Cub.

499
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:29,087
And we sprinkle each day with dew
and frost as we journey among stars.

500
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,143
Hey, what the heck is wrong with you...

501
00:39:34,647 --> 00:39:37,536
We're cold and we wanna go home.

502
00:39:37,561 --> 00:39:40,687
Mister, do you know what happened to our home?

503
00:39:41,435 --> 00:39:42,239
Not-not me!...

504
00:39:42,955 --> 00:39:44,751
I-I-I don't know anything about your home.

505
00:39:46,587 --> 00:39:48,564
Don't look at me! Come on, get out of here!

506
00:39:48,826 --> 00:39:51,319
We should call the police. Let them deal with it.

507
00:40:00,286 --> 00:40:01,354
What are you doing?

508
00:40:04,317 --> 00:40:05,492
Now you get off of there!

509
00:40:07,459 --> 00:40:08,389
Come on come down!

510
00:40:11,631 --> 00:40:14,066
T-T-They must be spirits.

511
00:40:14,091 --> 00:40:15,423
What do you mean spirits?

512
00:40:15,448 --> 00:40:19,810
Please, please spirits don't be angry!
W-we didn't mean to destroy your home!

513
00:40:40,411 --> 00:40:44,605
Ah, come on. Hold on a minute. You
wanna raise? We can work something out.

514
00:40:44,712 --> 00:40:46,261
Come on guys, wait!

515
00:40:46,286 --> 00:40:49,589
Look I don't care how much you
pay me. I'm getting out of here!

516
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,842
I've never seen anything that creepy in my life.

517
00:40:52,027 --> 00:40:52,910
Hands down.

518
00:40:53,102 --> 00:40:55,362
Don’t do this to me. Please.

519
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:00,673
People warned me that Tokyo was a scary
place, but this is way too scary for me.

520
00:41:00,986 --> 00:41:03,411
And if you know what is best for
you, you’ll get out of here too.

521
00:41:03,804 --> 00:41:04,986
Hey, come on, you guys...

522
00:41:05,011 --> 00:41:07,928
Someone or something doesn’t want this project to happen.

523
00:41:14,277 --> 00:41:17,474
<i>Surprisingly the racoons decided to celebrate.</i>

524
00:41:18,315 --> 00:41:24,637
<i>The evening celebration was especially grand in honor of
the spectacular performances by both Kiyo and Shoukichi.</i>

525
00:41:29,643 --> 00:41:30,806
Way to go!

526
00:41:30,831 --> 00:41:36,675
<i>That night for the first time in weeks the
construction workers barracks were dark and silent.</i>

527
00:41:37,076 --> 00:41:38,524
<i>But the next morning...</i>

528
00:41:39,779 --> 00:41:42,364
<i>There seemed to be and endless supply of humans.</i>

529
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,131
<i>No matter how many the racoons got rid of,</i>

530
00:41:45,365 --> 00:41:47,625
<i>more showed up to take their place.</i>

531
00:41:51,202 --> 00:41:56,114
Now some of your employees have suggested that
these incidents are the work of foxes or raccoons.

532
00:41:57,601 --> 00:41:59,490
What I'd give for that to be true.

533
00:41:59,581 --> 00:42:03,632
We could just skip the criminal
investigation and put out a few animal traps.

534
00:42:04,005 --> 00:42:07,179
<i>The raccoons feared the humans
were catching on to their secret.</i>

535
00:42:07,506 --> 00:42:12,340
You must admit the similarities between
these events and the old folk tales are uncanny.

536
00:42:12,412 --> 00:42:14,764
How would you explain these similarities?

537
00:42:14,789 --> 00:42:19,694
That's easy. Who's ever making up these stories
isn't even clever enough to come up with something new.

538
00:42:19,908 --> 00:42:23,210
We did not make anything up! We saw it with our own eyes!

539
00:42:23,235 --> 00:42:24,296
Fine, you win.

540
00:42:24,613 --> 00:42:29,950
Yeah, little racoons and foxes from old folks
tales are responsible for all these incidents.

541
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:31,931
As soon as you catch one in the act,

542
00:42:31,956 --> 00:42:34,836
you give us a holler. We'll exterminate it for ya'.

543
00:42:35,054 --> 00:42:37,865
That is... if it doesn’t just transform away.

544
00:42:39,917 --> 00:42:44,633
<i>Shoukichi began to worry, whether using their
transforming skills was the right thing to do.</i>

545
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:46,444
He was not the only one.

546
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:50,364
As you all know, there was a
time a few hundred years ago...

547
00:42:50,477 --> 00:42:53,507
when transforming was openly performed by racoons.

548
00:42:53,803 --> 00:42:55,635
It was a highly respected art form,

549
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:59,255
and was a popular subject for
the artist and writer of the time.

550
00:42:59,706 --> 00:43:03,444
But unfortunately we racoons went to far.

551
00:43:03,648 --> 00:43:05,949
We were to conspicuous with our skills.

552
00:43:06,114 --> 00:43:08,395
And we aroused the resentment of humans.

553
00:43:08,828 --> 00:43:14,684
Since then, we’ve been hunted for our pelts and our
fur has been used to make paint brushes and tooth brushes.

554
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,778
This is how the humans exacted their vengeance.

555
00:43:18,587 --> 00:43:23,003
And remember the last few decades
have been very peaceful for us,

556
00:43:23,253 --> 00:43:26,093
because we've shown restraint with our transforming.

557
00:43:26,387 --> 00:43:30,457
When humans see racoons these
days they generally just ignore us.

558
00:43:30,703 --> 00:43:32,963
This was not always the case.

559
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:37,027
The ability to transform is a double-edged sword.

560
00:43:37,308 --> 00:43:39,848
So, be sure to use your sword with discretion.

561
00:43:40,276 --> 00:43:43,884
We can not afford to evoke the
hatred of the humans yet again.

562
00:43:48,786 --> 00:43:50,370
<i>Following Oroku's lecture,</i>

563
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:52,905
<i>the young racoons' spirits were dashed.</i>

564
00:43:53,501 --> 00:43:55,801
<i>Furthermore, autumn was now upon them.</i>

565
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:59,777
<i>A time of year when racoons need to find plenty of food,</i>

566
00:43:59,896 --> 00:44:04,085
<i>so they can store ample fat and grow
long fluffy coats for the coming winter.</i>

567
00:44:04,795 --> 00:44:11,549
<i>The young racoons focused their attention and there
transforming skills on finding as much food as possible.</i>

568
00:44:12,212 --> 00:44:15,754
<i>Now more than ever they needed the advice of experts.</i>

569
00:44:16,161 --> 00:44:19,415
<i>They were desperate for the
masters from the islands to arrive.</i>

570
00:44:35,321 --> 00:44:40,494
<i>Then finally one day, an unfamiliar
raccoon arrived in Tama Hills.</i>

571
00:44:53,348 --> 00:44:55,389
Hey it's okay, I'm a raccoon too.

572
00:45:01,085 --> 00:45:01,924
Thank you.

573
00:45:03,009 --> 00:45:07,885
You seem to be quite exhausted.
How far did you say you have traveled?

574
00:45:07,923 --> 00:45:09,235
From Fujino Woods.

575
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:11,917
Oh, is that on Shikoku Island or Sado?

576
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:16,050
Uh... neither. It's just on
the other side of the mountains.

577
00:45:16,407 --> 00:45:17,412
Huh, what do you mean?

578
00:45:18,243 --> 00:45:20,829
Aren’t you a Transformation Master?

579
00:45:21,341 --> 00:45:25,816
Transformation Master? Oh no. I’m
sorry, you were expecting someone else?

580
00:45:26,006 --> 00:45:29,042
That's okay well just have to wait a little bit longer.

581
00:45:29,175 --> 00:45:31,442
Right, not your fault that all.

582
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:33,612
So, what brought you to Tama Hills then?

583
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:35,315
I was trying to find out:

584
00:45:35,396 --> 00:45:39,952
who in the world keeps dumping dirt into
our drinking water and on top of our homes?

585
00:45:41,423 --> 00:45:45,711
<i>Truckloads of dirt which had been
excavated at the New Tama construction site,</i>

586
00:45:45,819 --> 00:45:48,865
<i>were being illegally dump all over the Fujino woods.</i>

587
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:54,652
<i>The dirt polluted the streams and cause
frequent landslides, which devastated the forest.</i>

588
00:45:55,494 --> 00:45:59,319
<i>The animals of Fujino Woods knew something had to be done.</i>

589
00:45:59,877 --> 00:46:04,235
<i>To find out where all the dirt was
coming from, they decided to send a raccoon.</i>

590
00:46:04,593 --> 00:46:08,428
<i>The raccoon disguised himself as a
human, snuck aboard one of the dump trucks,</i>

591
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,070
<i>which was responsible for the illegal dumping.</i>

592
00:46:15,682 --> 00:46:19,393
<i>Unfortunately, he was not skilled
at the art of transformation.</i>

593
00:46:19,808 --> 00:46:25,064
The swaying of the truck and the stress of the journey so
exhausted him that he was unable to maintain human form.

594
00:46:26,764 --> 00:46:29,919
It's not just Fujino that's in
trouble. It's other woods too.

595
00:46:30,117 --> 00:46:33,625
And now there are garbage dumps
and golf courses all over the place.

596
00:46:34,267 --> 00:46:38,124
First, the developers dig up
Tama Hills and cause us to suffer...

597
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:42,923
then they dump the dirt on Fujino
Woods and cause you to suffer as well.

598
00:46:43,435 --> 00:46:45,974
The insanity just never ends.

599
00:46:47,527 --> 00:46:50,628
Yeah, I was shocked when the dump truck brought me here.

600
00:46:50,905 --> 00:46:55,768
I just assumed all the dirt was coming from some
enormous construction site in the middle of Tokyo.

601
00:46:56,026 --> 00:46:57,885
But we were in the countryside here.

602
00:46:58,286 --> 00:47:02,399
I'd never dream they'd dig one
forest so they could dump it on another.

603
00:47:02,712 --> 00:47:04,813
Why would the humans do such a thing?

604
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:09,186
So, if we find a way to stop the New Tama construction,

605
00:47:09,257 --> 00:47:13,132
we'll be saving all the raccoons in the
Fujino Woods as well as the Tama Hills.

606
00:47:13,721 --> 00:47:16,406
You think it's possible to stop the construction?

607
00:47:16,677 --> 00:47:19,871
All of you here are so accomplished
at the art of transformation.

608
00:47:20,148 --> 00:47:24,016
I bet with your impressive skills,
you could easily stop the development.

609
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:25,459
It'll be a piece of cake.

610
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:28,205
It's not that simple.

611
00:47:28,667 --> 00:47:30,876
We've tried everything we could think of.

612
00:47:35,201 --> 00:47:40,146
If only Bunta and Tamasaburou would
return with the Transformation Masters,

613
00:47:40,171 --> 00:47:43,017
I wonder why we haven't heard from them?

614
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:47,685
<i>Soon winter was upon them,</i>

615
00:47:48,106 --> 00:47:52,804
<i>but there was still no word from Tamasaburou,
Bunta or the Masters of Transformation.</i>

616
00:47:53,578 --> 00:47:58,090
<i>Food was scarce and the raccoons needed
to use all their energy for foraging.</i>

617
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:00,958
<i>Therefore, they were unable to continue transforming.</i>

618
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:05,100
<i>And all the work they did, haunting
the construction sites was soon forgotten.</i>

619
00:48:05,601 --> 00:48:09,697
<i>The media quickly moved on to the
usual celebrity and political scandals.</i>

00:48:30,495 --> 00:48:33,324
<i>all of Tama Hills was covered with a blanket of snow.</i>

626
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:37,591
<i>And most of the construction workers
had already returned to their hometowns,</i>

627
00:48:37,884 --> 00:48:40,258

Wait for us!

00:48:49,767 --> 00:48:50,425
We'll help.

Hey, that's our rig.

633
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:53,274
What's going on?

634
00:48:53,299 --> 00:48:53,665
What?

635
00:48:54,642 --> 00:48:55,823
Oh no!

636
00:48:56,431 --> 00:48:58,490

641
00:49:14,906 --> 00:49:16,532
Hey, don't point the finger at us.

642
00:49:16,557 --> 00:49:19,098
The raccoons did it. We all saw it with our own eyes.

643
00:49:19,101 --> 00:49:20,410
So get off our backs.

644
00:49:20,769 --> 00:49:24,389
Nevertheless, police still suspect
these workers were responsible.

645
00:49:24,456 --> 00:49:29,392
And that they were inspired by the numerous pranks
which occurred at this construction site last fall.

646
00:49:29,825 --> 00:49:32,032
Police are searching the area for footprints.

647
00:49:32,057 --> 00:49:34,377
But the snow around the crime scene has already melted.

648
00:49:34,402 --> 00:49:36,533
Why in the world could do that, Shoukichi?

649
00:49:36,776 --> 00:49:39,069
I don't think there was anything wrong with what we did.

650
00:49:39,145 --> 00:49:41,076
You should have done more than that.

651
00:49:41,164 --> 00:49:47,138
No. Shoukichi was just trying to encourage the
raccoons who can't transform by letting them help out.

652
00:49:47,338 --> 00:49:48,993
Should we be worried, Osho?

653
00:49:50,802 --> 00:49:53,190
I think we'll be okay this time.

654
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,486
<i>It was just as Osho predicted.</i>

655
00:49:55,913 --> 00:49:59,138
<i>No one believed that the raccoons
were responsible for the incident.</i>

656
00:49:59,634 --> 00:50:02,507
<i>Rather, most believe that the
construction workers were guilty.</i>

657
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:06,169
<i>Due to lack of evidence however, the men were released.</i>

658
00:50:06,424 --> 00:50:09,243
<i>To this day, the case remains unsolved.</i>

659
00:50:14,923 --> 00:50:16,426
<i>Soon, it was springtime.</i>

660
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,993
<i>And love was in the air once again.</i>

661
00:50:19,705 --> 00:50:25,263
<i>After refraining from romance for an entire year the
raccoons were unable to control themselves any longer.</i>

662
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:29,958
<i>The air was filled with the sounds of
lovers' quarrels, and sweet nothings,</i>

663
00:50:30,189 --> 00:50:34,532
<i>and the raccoons courted each other
until even the skies turned rosy.</i>

664
00:50:40,085 --> 00:50:41,553
Hey, wait up!

665
00:50:48,999 --> 00:50:50,353
Wait for me!

666
00:50:50,722 --> 00:50:53,786
Come on Gonta, you gotta catch me.

667
00:50:56,013 --> 00:50:58,947
Don't tease me! Hanako!

668
00:51:00,329 --> 00:51:01,541
Wait!

669
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:05,502
As soon as it's springtime everybody goes crazy.

670
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:08,568
All of a sudden they wanna get married and have families.

671
00:51:09,136 --> 00:51:13,541
Nobody seems to remember Oroku's warning
that we're not supposed to have any cubs.

672
00:51:14,144 --> 00:51:17,283
The second the sun hits their fur they fall in love.

673
00:51:19,889 --> 00:51:23,754
But not us, you don't see us chasing
after each other like we're lunatics.

674
00:51:24,109 --> 00:51:27,777
We can handle not getting married,
and not having cubs, don't you think?

675
00:51:28,161 --> 00:51:29,638
Of course we can.

676
00:51:29,901 --> 00:51:33,157
I'm so pleased. It's just what I'd hoped you'd say.

677
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:35,898
You're, wonderful!

678
00:51:37,935 --> 00:51:42,060
Yeah, we can hold off. I don't need
to kiss or cuddle or rub noses or…

679
00:51:42,117 --> 00:51:43,415
Oh, Shoukichi!

680
00:51:51,718 --> 00:51:53,036
<i>That was a mistake…</i>

681
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:58,745
<i>Kiyo and Shoukichi were soon married and
had 4 charming raccoon cubs within the year.</i>

682
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:02,581
<i>During the previous Autumn,</i>

683
00:53:02,606 --> 00:53:07,497
<i>Tamasaburou had managed yo reach the Island
of Shikoku despite a long and difficult journey.</i>

684
00:53:07,905 --> 00:53:14,139
<i>As soon as he arrived he presented his request for help
to Kinchou the VI, one of the Masters of transformation.</i>

685
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:17,524
<i>But then he collapsed and was gravely ill for many weeks.</i>

686
00:53:19,289 --> 00:53:22,056
<i>Luckily, Kinchou had a daughter, Koharu,</i>

687
00:53:22,381 --> 00:53:26,442
<i>who stayed at Tamasaburou bedside and
miraculously nursed him back to health.</i>

688
00:53:26,987 --> 00:53:30,583
<i>With the coming of spring the bond
between the two young raccoons deepened.</i>

689
00:53:30,815 --> 00:53:33,893
<i>And Koharu soon bore Tamasaburou three cubs.</i>

690
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:41,703
<i>Inside the shrine, the elders of Shikoku Island
held a meeting to discuss the situation in Tama Hills.</i>

691
00:53:42,163 --> 00:53:44,856
<i>They all agreed that putting a
stop to the New Tama project...</i>

692
00:53:44,881 --> 00:53:49,995
<i>would send a much needed message of hope to
raccoons in similar situations all over the country.</i>

693
00:53:50,535 --> 00:53:53,643
<i>But the elders were divided as
to who should go to Tama Hills,</i>

694
00:53:53,936 --> 00:53:56,360
<i>who should stay behind to govern Shikoku Island,</i>

695
00:53:56,607 --> 00:54:01,210
<i>and if any of the masters died while on
this dangerous mission who should replace them.</i>

696
00:54:01,535 --> 00:54:06,302
<i>Even after months and months of discussions,
they were unable to reach a consensus.</i>

697
00:54:08,661 --> 00:54:10,820
Father the elders never stop talking.

698
00:54:11,026 --> 00:54:12,320
They should get outside.

699
00:54:12,623 --> 00:54:13,973
It's such a beautiful day.

700
00:54:15,689 --> 00:54:18,844
I can't believe that they've been
debating for over six months now.

701
00:54:19,712 --> 00:54:22,342
I'm beginning to wonder if
they'll ever come to a decision.

702
00:54:24,657 --> 00:54:26,725
I hope they never decide what to do.

703
00:54:31,348 --> 00:54:32,473
Tamasaburou…

704
00:54:32,799 --> 00:54:36,450
I beg you, don't go back to Tama
Hills with the Transformation Masters.

705
00:54:36,535 --> 00:54:39,376
The thought of you being so far
away from me and the children...

706
00:54:39,789 --> 00:54:41,188
I can't stand it!

707
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,609
It breaks my heart!

708
00:54:46,308 --> 00:54:50,238
Ah, darling. I too wish we could stay together forever.

709
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:52,114
But you must understand…

710
00:54:52,595 --> 00:54:54,209
No we don't understand.

711
00:54:56,439 --> 00:54:58,271
Why can't you stay here with me.

712
00:54:58,296 --> 00:55:00,523
The Masters can make it to Tama without you...

713
00:55:00,735 --> 00:55:02,494
I'll talk to father and the elders.

714
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:05,608
Why don't you stay behind and be father's successor?

715
00:55:18,901 --> 00:55:23,188
<i>While Tamasaburou struggled to decide
whether or not leave Shikoku Island,</i>

716
00:55:23,788 --> 00:55:29,575
<i>Bunta roamed the fields and mountains of Sado Island,
searching for the islands Master of Transformation.</i>

717
00:55:30,549 --> 00:55:35,597
<i>Oddly, not a single raccoon on the island
knew the whereabouts of the renowned master.</i>

718
00:55:46,851 --> 00:55:51,361
<i>Back in Tama Hills the raccoons
were facing some serious problems.</i>

719
00:55:51,655 --> 00:55:55,311
<i>Their woods were continuing to
shrink due to the New Tama development.</i>

720
00:55:55,818 --> 00:55:59,141
<i>The recent baby boom doubled the
number of mouths they had to feed.</i>

721
00:55:59,396 --> 00:56:02,742
<i>And poor summer weather brought
about a serious food shortage.</i>

722
00:56:03,299 --> 00:56:08,507
<i>The chestnut and persimmon trees on witch they always
relied provided nowhere near enough food to go around.</i>

723
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:14,837
<i>Having no where else to turn, the raccoons with
transforming skills went in search of human food.</i>

724
00:56:15,587 --> 00:56:21,273
<i>Despite all their efforts, they were still unable to
collect enough food to sustain the raccoon community.</i>

725
00:56:22,076 --> 00:56:27,821
<i>Finally, even raccoons who couldn't
transform began scavenging around human homes,</i>

726
00:56:28,109 --> 00:56:30,963
<i>desperate to find anything to feed their cubs.</i>

727
00:56:32,048 --> 00:56:37,929
<i>Inevitably, many raccoons lost their
lives on the roads and in animal traps.</i>

728
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:25,382
I can't take this anymore!

729
00:57:25,658 --> 00:57:27,571
We got to stand up to the humans now!

730
00:57:27,596 --> 00:57:29,480
Even if it cost us our lives!

731
00:57:29,762 --> 00:57:30,755
Right, Shoukichi?

732
00:57:30,917 --> 00:57:33,918
Wait a minute… have you healed yet, Gonta?

733
00:57:34,049 --> 00:57:36,538
Of course I have! Watch this!

734
00:57:45,759 --> 00:57:47,267
You're better than ever.

735
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:50,045
Hey, we should have a party and celebrate.

736
00:57:51,717 --> 00:57:54,654
There's no time for a party. It's time to attack!

737
00:57:55,649 --> 00:57:57,681
Hold on, Gonta. I think that we should wait for...

738
00:57:57,685 --> 00:58:01,008
the Transformation Masters to
arrive before we plan another attack.

739
00:58:01,142 --> 00:58:05,255
What is wrong with you, Shoukichi?
You're too young to be such a big coward.

740
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,088
You're wrong, we can't underestimate the humans.

741
00:58:08,173 --> 00:58:11,453
If we attacked them head on they will destroy us.

742
00:58:12,133 --> 00:58:13,989
We have waited long enough!

743
00:58:14,121 --> 00:58:17,355
Calm down, give Shoukichi a chance to speak.

744
00:58:18,372 --> 00:58:21,925
I propose we adopt three policies
while we wait for the masters.

745
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:26,259
One: Have the raccoons that can
transform go to the city and gathered food.

746
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,611
Then we'll all share the food equally.

747
00:58:30,379 --> 00:58:32,979
Two: Train every one in traffic safety.

748
00:58:33,023 --> 00:58:34,141
Yeah!

749
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:39,536
Three: Organize rescue squads to
free any raccoons caught in traps.

750
00:58:39,654 --> 00:58:40,399
That's it.

751
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:47,029
Shoukichi, you sound like a human.
Are you sure you're ready a raccoon?

752
00:58:47,427 --> 00:58:49,523
Yes! And don't you ever doubt it!

753
00:58:51,587 --> 00:58:55,704
Well then, assuming will work out all the
details later I think we should take a vote.

754
00:58:55,731 --> 00:58:57,911
All those who agree with Shoukichi's proposal…

755
00:58:57,936 --> 00:58:58,850
Stick 'em up!

756
00:58:59,906 --> 00:59:01,070
Agreed!

757
00:59:03,242 --> 00:59:05,082
What kind of nonsense is this, Gonta?

758
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,938
Shut up! It's for real.

759
00:59:07,498 --> 00:59:11,787
Anybody who dares to oppose me from
now on will be killed by my private guard!

760
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:12,813
Got it?

761
00:59:13,086 --> 00:59:14,049
Yeah!

762
00:59:14,764 --> 00:59:17,187
You need to think about what you're saying, Gonta.

763
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:19,626
You'll address him as sir Gonta!

764
00:59:20,874 --> 00:59:23,959
Raccoons! We all know the humans are dangerous!

765
00:59:24,282 --> 00:59:28,248
But if we attack without concern
for ourselves, we will win.

766
00:59:28,782 --> 00:59:30,357
As the old saying goes,

767
00:59:30,647 --> 00:59:32,769
"When a mouse is cornered he will bite a cat!"

768
00:59:34,174 --> 00:59:35,488
He's a mouse?

769
00:59:35,513 --> 00:59:36,848
He's not a mouse.

770
00:59:36,979 --> 00:59:39,692
He means that if we're desperate
enough we can beat anyone.

771
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:43,621
That's right. When a mouse is cornered
he can find the strength to defeat a cat!

772
00:59:44,002 --> 00:59:44,653
That's what I said.

773
00:59:45,147 --> 00:59:47,275
But we're not mice though.

774
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,686
Why would we want to beat up a cat, you know?

775
00:59:49,907 --> 00:59:54,882
I'm starved. Sure would like to
have a mouse to eat right about now.

776
00:59:54,907 --> 00:59:56,929
A good mouse tempura can't be beat.

777
00:59:57,143 --> 00:59:59,809
Not true. Plain deep fried is better.

778
01:00:00,617 --> 01:00:03,646
I don't know, I think the tempura
batter is what really makes it.

779
01:00:03,908 --> 01:00:07,650
The thought of the crispy tail makes my mouth watered.

780
01:00:09,496 --> 01:00:12,463
What is the matter with all of you?!?

781
01:00:12,745 --> 01:00:14,241
I say that:

782
01:00:14,287 --> 01:00:18,793
♪ That mouse tempura is the best. Oh yes it is. ♪

783
01:00:18,818 --> 01:00:22,688
See, Gonta. We can't fight.
all we can think about is food.

784
01:00:23,436 --> 01:00:27,226
I think it's best if we wait for
the Transformation Masters to get here.

785
01:00:28,967 --> 01:00:30,085
Sorry about that.

786
01:00:30,601 --> 01:00:33,591
If only we could have held off on having more cubs.

787
01:00:34,358 --> 01:00:36,192
But nobody wanted to listen.

788
01:00:36,276 --> 01:00:38,552
I guess it was too much to expect from every one.

789
01:00:38,577 --> 01:00:39,468
You're wrong!

790
01:00:40,244 --> 01:00:44,295
Instead of reducing our ranks we
should be reducing the number of humans!

791
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:48,670
The forests where we used to live
are now occupied by swarms of humans!

792
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:51,094
They're the ones who are the intruders!

793
01:00:51,702 --> 01:00:52,914
We should kick them out!

794
01:00:53,311 --> 01:00:55,038
Kick out the humans!

795
01:00:55,299 --> 01:00:57,020
Kick out the humans!

796
01:00:57,327 --> 01:00:58,584
Kick the humans out!

797
01:00:59,034 --> 01:01:00,869
Kill them all!!!

798
01:01:01,781 --> 01:01:04,183
<i>Little did they know, at that very moment…</i>

799
01:01:16,982 --> 01:01:18,240
Hey, taxi!

800
01:01:39,522 --> 01:01:40,346
Hey, look!

801
01:01:40,371 --> 01:01:41,608
Oh my goodness!

802
01:01:50,535 --> 01:01:51,948
I'll go tell everyone you're here.

803
01:02:04,489 --> 01:02:05,638
Tamasaburou!

804
01:02:06,023 --> 01:02:08,252
The Masters from Shikoku Island are here!

805
01:02:11,614 --> 01:02:13,398
You did it, Tamasaburou!

806
01:02:22,766 --> 01:02:28,590
Raccoons, on our way here we witness the
devastation that is occurring in your forest.

807
01:02:28,842 --> 01:02:30,435
We feel your pain.

808
01:02:31,082 --> 01:02:36,235
Call all the raccoons in the area, we will hold a
meeting tonight to address this problem immediately.

809
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:39,670
<i>Autumn, year 33rd of the Pom Poko era,</i>

810
01:02:39,993 --> 01:02:41,928
<i>the masters had finally arrived.</i>

811
01:02:42,143 --> 01:02:45,284
<i>The raccoons gathered to greet them. Their hope restored.</i>

812
01:02:45,494 --> 01:02:49,397
I am pleased to see such a fine moon out tonight.

813
01:02:50,091 --> 01:02:55,158
Fellow raccoons, I am Hage of Shikoku Island.

814
01:02:55,714 --> 01:03:00,637
In a few days I will be 999 years old.

815
01:03:01,731 --> 01:03:08,455
Raccoons, why is Tama Hills ravaged by
development while our island is nearly untouched,

816
01:03:08,787 --> 01:03:14,294
That's because we raccoons of Shikoku never
stop haunting our forests and our mountains.

817
01:03:14,706 --> 01:03:20,872
Therefore, the humans on our island are
well aware that disaster will befall them,

818
01:03:20,904 --> 01:03:23,658
whenever they dare to enter our territory.

819
01:03:24,274 --> 01:03:30,266
In fact, Master's Kinchou, Hage, and
myself, are so good at frightened humans.

820
01:03:30,296 --> 01:03:37,288
The various forms the three of us take are
worshiped in shrines and temples all over the island.

821
01:03:37,543 --> 01:03:42,684
My name is Gyobu and I have led the
raccoons of our island to peace and prosperity.

822
01:03:42,961 --> 01:03:46,918
I can lead you there, as well.

823
01:03:49,829 --> 01:03:52,755
Allow me to formally introduce myself as well.

824
01:03:53,008 --> 01:03:54,607
I'm the Kinchou the VI.

825
01:03:55,411 --> 01:03:58,862
In order to frightened every
last human being out of Tama Hills.

826
01:03:58,976 --> 01:03:59,559
Voilà!

827
01:03:59,994 --> 01:04:06,230
We've decided to execute Operation Specter, our
plan which relies on our mastery of transformation.

828
01:04:06,567 --> 01:04:10,004
This plan requires extreme amounts of mental energy,

829
01:04:10,386 --> 01:04:15,323
so much energy, in fact, that any
one of the three of us may not survive.

830
01:04:16,553 --> 01:04:21,683
But my fellow raccoons, we the Masters
of Shikoku are willing to take this risk.

831
01:04:21,708 --> 01:04:27,156
If we all combine all our efforts at successfully
carry out this plan, the humans will be so frightened,

832
01:04:27,419 --> 01:04:30,322
they will never set foot in Tama Hills again.

833
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:32,050
Yeah!

834
01:04:32,075 --> 01:04:32,963
And then…

835
01:04:34,002 --> 01:04:39,892
once the human beings are fully primed with fear
we'll be able to stop their infernal development...

836
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:42,364
of destruction of the forests once and for all.

837
01:04:42,788 --> 01:04:45,156
Mark my words we will prevail.

838
01:04:45,495 --> 01:04:49,159
We have brought you a boat, a
boat that will swiftly ferry...

839
01:04:49,292 --> 01:04:53,387
the raccoons of Tama Hills back to an era of greatness.

840
01:04:53,574 --> 01:04:59,058
Fellow raccoons, we promise you
we are now in this boat together!

841
01:05:17,424 --> 01:05:19,779
What a spectacular moon.

842
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:24,049
There is nothing better than moonlight.

843
01:05:24,414 --> 01:05:28,829
Let us all bow our heads and
pray to this gorgeous full moon...

844
01:05:28,863 --> 01:05:33,816
that Operation Spector will be
safe, sound and extremely successful.

845
01:05:45,951 --> 01:05:51,723
<i>The Masters immediately began a special training
regimen to prepare the raccoons for Operation Spector.</i>

846
01:06:06,562 --> 01:06:12,024
Congratulations on your 999th birthday Master Hage!

847
01:06:14,824 --> 01:06:17,444
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

848
01:06:17,813 --> 01:06:18,753
Thank you.

849
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:24,753
Master, will you reenact the tail
of the young samurai who shot the fan.

850
01:06:25,043 --> 01:06:27,618
Ah, I'll need some help.

851
01:07:13,391 --> 01:07:16,134
Yes, today's the day.

<i>Raccoons have always been able to transform
themselves into simple ghosts and goblins forms.</i>

866
01:08:25,291 --> 01:08:30,392
<i>For Operation Specter to be successful,
the raccoons had to become much more advanced.</i>

867
01:08:30,888 --> 01:08:34,042
<i>The Masters taught them to
utilize not only their own energy.</i>

868
01:08:34,309 --> 01:08:39,599
<i>But also the energy of the world around
them in fire, earth, water, and air.</i>

869
01:08:40,095 --> 01:08:44,717
<i>The training was so physically taxing
and intense its nearly beyond description.</i>

870
01:08:45,177 --> 01:08:48,990
<i>All the raccoons participated,
whether they could transform or not.</i>

871
01:08:49,281 --> 01:08:53,096
<i>And together they generated and
focus phenomenal quantities of power.</i>

872
01:08:53,985 --> 01:08:57,809
<i>That night, the fighting spirit of
the raccoons was greater than ever.</i>

873
01:08:58,004 --> 01:09:00,540
In fact their enthusiasm was so boundless...

874
01:09:00,751 --> 01:09:06,257
they began transforming into a parade of frightening
specters long before they reached the human city.

01:11:38,733 --> 01:11:39,320
Look!

887
01:12:09,286 --> 01:12:11,937
Hey mom, we're missing the monster parade!

888
01:12:11,962 --> 01:12:12,902
Honey, wait.

889
01:12:13,418 --> 01:12:16,596
I used to see stuff like that too when I was a kid.

890
01:12:16,983 --> 01:12:20,106
You know, monsters in the closet. That kind of thing.

891
01:12:20,985 --> 01:12:24,261
You know when you're young they seem so, so real.

892
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:29,566
I swear I saw these ghosts dancin' on my ceiling.

893
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:34,389
Just have another drink you'll see them again.

894
01:12:39,811 --> 01:12:43,546
Isn't that weird? Now where do you think you see that?

895
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:46,405
Do you think ghost really exist?

896
01:12:46,609 --> 01:12:49,176
Huh? Don't be stupid.

897
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:55,539
It's your brain playing tricks.

898
01:12:56,105 --> 01:13:00,657
It must be… your brain plays
tricks on you when you're young.

899
01:13:01,061 --> 01:13:05,446
Things like the bogeyman and monsters in the closet.

900
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:08,479
They're all in your head because of…

901
01:13:10,896 --> 01:13:13,825
all the scary stories people tell you as a kid.

902
01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:16,022
It plants the seeds in your brain.

903
01:13:16,736 --> 01:13:18,723
So, as a kid you think it's real.

904
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:26,915
Kids are suckers because there's
no way those ghost stories are real.

905
01:13:27,033 --> 01:13:29,815
Still… they frighten you have to death.

906
01:13:30,262 --> 01:13:30,695
Yup.

907
01:13:31,473 --> 01:13:36,693
The brain is scary that way. You think
things and then you see them whether real or not.

908
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,165
You ima... imagination.

909
01:13:40,784 --> 01:13:43,137
There really are monsters out there.

910
01:13:43,534 --> 01:13:47,623
See, we talk about ghost and you start to see em.

911
01:13:53,354 --> 01:13:54,130
Hi, dear.

912
01:13:56,921 --> 01:13:57,649
Honey!

913
01:14:45,723 --> 01:14:48,751
FIRE BURNING BRIGHTLY!

914
01:14:56,797 --> 01:14:59,937
WATER FLOWING SWIFTLY!

915
01:16:02,196 --> 01:16:03,129
The trees!

916
01:16:14,828 --> 01:16:16,465
Master Gyobu!

917
01:16:21,615 --> 01:16:22,760
He's gone.

918
01:16:23,063 --> 01:16:24,678
Master Gyobu!

919
01:16:26,847 --> 01:16:27,678
That was unreal!

920
01:16:27,703 --> 01:16:30,257
I've never seen anything like that my whole life!

921
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:35,431
Aw, is it over already?

922
01:16:35,456 --> 01:16:37,685
That was really great wasn't it mom.

923
01:16:37,884 --> 01:16:38,554
Yeah.

924
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:41,200
Alright bedtime, let's get inside.

925
01:16:42,082 --> 01:16:43,133
Kay.

926
01:16:46,054 --> 01:16:48,378
Hey, don't forget to brush your teeth okay?

927
01:16:48,409 --> 01:16:49,169
Kay, mom.

928
01:16:51,611 --> 01:16:54,657
That was amazing. I feel like I just woke up from a dream.

929
01:16:54,749 --> 01:16:57,617
I know. What in the world you think that was anyway.

930
01:16:59,368 --> 01:17:00,148
I don't know.

931
01:17:00,754 --> 01:17:02,503
Maybe they were UFOs.

932
01:17:02,533 --> 01:17:04,451
Some things you just can't explain.

933
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:13,933
Long ago when various raccoon families
were feuding on the Island of Shikoku,

934
01:17:14,025 --> 01:17:16,443
Yoko Labelle then allied himself with the enemy.

935
01:17:16,581 --> 01:17:19,344
His betrayal led to the downfall of his clan.

936
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:26,277
Yoko so profoundly regretted his actions that he took
a solemn vow to devote his life to further injustice.

937
01:17:26,669 --> 01:17:29,888
We must ensure that his sacrifice
to this cause was not in vain.

938
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:32,831
We must continue his noble quest for justice.

939
01:17:33,077 --> 01:17:36,870
And we must vow that we will keep
fighting until our day of victory.

01:18:01,338 --> 01:18:05,119
Big success. Big success. Big success.

949
01:18:14,876 --> 01:18:17,215
The videotape is completely blank.

950
01:18:18,077 --> 01:18:19,199
I have no idea what happened.

951
01:18:19,710 --> 01:18:23,328
It came through this crack and then
it flew around the kitchen ceiling.

952
01:18:23,988 --> 01:18:25,246
It was terrifying.

953
01:18:25,792 --> 01:18:28,621
I swear, there's no way someone could have stage that.

954
01:18:29,724 --> 01:18:33,109
Uh yeah, something strange is
definitely going on in New Tama.

955
01:18:33,461 --> 01:18:35,764
I'd like to move out but I just can afford to.

956
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:39,455
Tune in at midnight tonight for a special program,

957
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:43,278
which will cover this evening's
bizarre events in greater detail.

958
01:18:53,718 --> 01:18:56,678
The more the humans investigate Operation Specter...

959
01:18:57,001 --> 01:19:00,158
the more they'll be forced to
admit that what they experienced...

960
01:19:00,183 --> 01:19:05,933
was not their imagination, a dream, or
a hallucination, but irrefutable fact.

961
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:09,965
Then they'll turn to science and
technology and their fancy machines.

962
01:19:10,656 --> 01:19:14,299
When that fails to solve this mystery,
the humans will finally be humbled.

963
01:19:14,324 --> 01:19:19,622
And now since they've witnessed something
they can't explain no matter how hard they try,

964
01:19:19,908 --> 01:19:25,579
they will be forced to realize that humans are
not the only worthy form of life in the universe.

965
01:19:25,827 --> 01:19:30,194
Raccoons, the changes may take
time but why wait to celebrate.

966
01:19:30,679 --> 01:19:32,228
It's time to party.

967
01:19:32,253 --> 01:19:38,269
Come on, it's time to sing and
drink and dance until alights out, yes.

968
01:19:38,992 --> 01:19:43,405
♪ We're dancing, we're dancing.
Master Hage Hage Hage Hage. ♪

969
01:19:44,551 --> 01:19:48,308
<i>The next day however, events took an unexpected turn.</i>

970
01:19:51,081 --> 01:19:53,853
It appears that the massive parades staged yesterday...

971
01:19:53,878 --> 01:19:59,363
in a recently constructed portion of the New Tama
residential complex was a publicity stunt for Wonderland,

972
01:19:59,388 --> 01:20:01,840
a theme park now under construction in the area.

973
01:20:02,084 --> 01:20:06,463
Police say the responsible party will be
fined for staging a parade without a permit.

974
01:20:06,488 --> 01:20:07,095
You're kidding!

975
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:10,902
However, residents of the New
Tama complex remain convinced...

976
01:20:10,927 --> 01:20:14,497
that what they saw yesterday could
not have been a publicity stunt.

977
01:20:14,698 --> 01:20:16,133
That's more like it!

978
01:20:16,778 --> 01:20:21,926
The president of Wonderland admitted that last
night's parade was an unauthorized promotional event.

979
01:20:22,216 --> 01:20:23,515
It was not!

980
01:20:25,883 --> 01:20:33,140
Let me uh... apologize for any inconvenience.
you might have had from our little parade.

981
01:20:33,319 --> 01:20:34,776
Who is that guy?

982
01:20:35,313 --> 01:20:40,113
Our intention here at Wonderland Theme
Park was just to let the community know...

983
01:20:41,191 --> 01:20:45,542
how wonderful our wonderful Wonderland Theme Park will be.

984
01:20:45,778 --> 01:20:52,193
So, we thought the best way... was to...
give the public a taste of Wonderland for free.

985
01:20:52,802 --> 01:20:57,509
As the park's president, I take
full responsibility for the decision...

986
01:20:57,510 --> 01:21:01,723
to stage this unauthorized but
truly spectacular event for free.

987
01:21:03,408 --> 01:21:04,044
Liar!

988
01:21:05,328 --> 01:21:09,137
We've received an overwhelmingly
positive response to our parade.

989
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:13,862
Yeah the public's enthusiasm
quite frankly was astonishing.

990
01:21:14,442 --> 01:21:21,296
Because of this, I must admit I do not regret
my decision to hold this parade in the least.

991
01:21:21,459 --> 01:21:25,374
I'll have you know, that even
if I have to go to jail for this,

992
01:21:25,716 --> 01:21:30,135
I believe that your positive reaction was worth it.

993
01:21:31,833 --> 01:21:32,958
Is this for real?

994
01:21:34,899 --> 01:21:37,379
He's stealing credit for all of our hard work!

995
01:21:39,042 --> 01:21:41,192
I believe that your positive...

996
01:21:41,517 --> 01:21:42,790
You liar!

997
01:21:45,638 --> 01:21:48,700
<i>The news sent the raccoons into a state of panic.</i>

998
01:21:48,816 --> 01:21:50,706
Meanwhile, at Wonderland headquarters,

999
01:21:50,731 --> 01:21:54,527
the president was desperately searching
for those responsible for the parade.

1000
01:21:54,557 --> 01:21:57,380
No way, are you nuts? We can't back down now!

1001
01:21:57,405 --> 01:21:59,196
Just find out who put on that parade?

1002
01:21:59,546 --> 01:22:01,479
And then, hire them all!

1003
01:22:01,668 --> 01:22:04,413
Yeah! Throw as much money as you can at them.

1004
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:05,873
Pay them whatever they want!

1005
01:22:06,082 --> 01:22:07,841
What if raccoons are the ones that did it?

1006
01:22:07,866 --> 01:22:09,301
What you mean raccoons!

1007
01:22:09,405 --> 01:22:12,121
I don't care if it was raccoons or penguins or gopher's.

1008
01:22:12,307 --> 01:22:15,156
You go find them and get them working exclusively for me!

1009
01:22:16,751 --> 01:22:20,488
Uh, wait a minute… why did I say raccoons?

1010
01:22:20,539 --> 01:22:22,179
Oh I'm sure you're just joking.

1011
01:22:22,416 --> 01:22:23,936
Where'd you come from?

1012
01:22:24,352 --> 01:22:26,829
Who are you? You're not supposed to be in here!

1013
01:22:27,023 --> 01:22:29,192
Don't worry, your assistant let me in.

1014
01:22:29,811 --> 01:22:32,948
I'm Ryutarou. I called you earlier remember?

1015
01:22:34,718 --> 01:22:40,012
I am the only one who could possibly lead you to
the ones responsible for that spectacular parade.

1016
01:22:40,096 --> 01:22:43,277
But I require my fair share of the business.

1017
01:22:44,751 --> 01:22:47,018
Forget it! How about a million dollars.

1018
01:22:50,479 --> 01:22:54,319
<i>While Ryutarou negotiated highly
lucrative terms for his partnership,</i>

1019
01:22:55,329 --> 01:22:57,088
<i>the raccoons were dumbfounded.</i>

1020
01:22:57,664 --> 01:23:00,727
<i>This bizarre human had completely stolen their thunder.</i>

1021
01:23:01,114 --> 01:23:04,084
<i>And at first they railed against the unfairness of it all.</i>

1022
01:23:04,802 --> 01:23:09,388
<i>But soon the sheer hopelessness of their
situation began to sap their will to fight.</i>

1023
01:23:10,644 --> 01:23:13,886
<i>Meanwhile, with no footage of Operation Spector,</i>

1024
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:18,925
<i>media coverage quickly petered out and the
public soon lost interest in the whole affair.</i>

1025
01:23:31,508 --> 01:23:33,614
You're a fox, isn't that right?

1026
01:23:36,348 --> 01:23:37,704
You have a good eye.

1027
01:23:38,633 --> 01:23:43,157
Indeed, I am a transforming fox.
I am Ryutarou, at your service.

1028
01:23:44,635 --> 01:23:48,708
I am honored to meet such a world
renown raccoon as yourself Master Kinchou.

1029
01:23:48,973 --> 01:23:50,595
I've heard much about you.

1030
01:23:50,772 --> 01:23:53,514
I am nothing more than a sixth in a long line.

1031
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:57,310
So, what business brings you
all the way out to our forest?

1032
01:23:57,343 --> 01:24:00,675
I wanted to congratulate you on
the fabulous parade you staged.

1033
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:02,941
You knew we were behind it. Did you?

1034
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:08,231
Of course. And I give you my condolences
for Wonderland stealing all the credit.

1035
01:24:08,611 --> 01:24:09,373
Thank you.

1036
01:24:11,555 --> 01:24:16,234
Of course, as a fox you would
understand that it was raccoons.

1037
01:24:16,398 --> 01:24:20,331
I wasn't surprised by what happened
after the parade, Master Kinchou.

1038
01:24:21,073 --> 01:24:22,034
How's that?

1039
01:24:22,270 --> 01:24:25,938
<i>Ryutarou was, needless to say, as sly as a fox.</i>

1040
01:24:26,132 --> 01:24:30,562
<i>He and his silver tongue lured Kinchou
into one of the swankiest clubs in Tokyo.</i>

1041
01:24:31,479 --> 01:24:32,705
Welcome.

1042
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:38,449
Now don't you worry all the girls here are foxes too.

1043
01:24:42,217 --> 01:24:44,483
What's the problem? Don't you like them this way?

1044
01:24:44,508 --> 01:24:45,866
Were you rather they were foxes?

1045
01:24:45,891 --> 01:24:48,249
Or perhaps you prefer they were raccoons...

1046
01:24:50,902 --> 01:24:52,606
I'll get right to the point then.

1047
01:24:53,186 --> 01:24:55,494
There's no future for the raccoons of Tama Hills.

1048
01:24:55,789 --> 01:24:58,095
They'll die off soon. Just like the foxes.

1049
01:24:59,244 --> 01:25:01,545
So, that's what happened to all the foxes.

1050
01:25:01,570 --> 01:25:03,357
Yes, I'm afraid so.

1051
01:25:03,989 --> 01:25:07,240
Except for those of us with transforming skills.

1052
01:25:07,403 --> 01:25:10,269
We have learned to survive by
living among humans like this.

1053
01:25:10,452 --> 01:25:11,884
As humans?

1054
01:25:11,909 --> 01:25:15,087
It's the only way to survive
if you plan on living near Tokyo.

1055
01:25:15,602 --> 01:25:17,894
And that is why I wanted to meet with you today.

1056
01:25:17,992 --> 01:25:21,009
To invite you raccoons to live the same way as we do here.

1057
01:25:21,287 --> 01:25:22,801
Now hold on a minute!

1058
01:25:22,843 --> 01:25:26,545
I know we may sound a little strange
but allow me to complete the picture.

1059
01:25:27,268 --> 01:25:31,138
You won't be living like ordinary
humans. You'll be filthy rich.

1060
01:25:31,307 --> 01:25:32,934
You'll be extremely well fed.

1061
01:25:32,959 --> 01:25:36,544
And you will be working in the luxurious
environment of Wonderland Theme Park...

1062
01:25:36,649 --> 01:25:38,840
with your fellow transforming raccoons.

1063
01:25:39,039 --> 01:25:43,581
You're insane! Do you think we'd work for
those liars who stole credit for our work!

1064
01:25:44,116 --> 01:25:45,552
Let's not get upset.

1065
01:25:45,970 --> 01:25:48,610
It's a fact that it's time for you to live as humans.

1066
01:25:49,107 --> 01:25:50,498
But here's the problem.

1067
01:25:51,385 --> 01:25:54,017
♪ The human world requires wealth and greed, ♪

1068
01:25:54,125 --> 01:25:56,390
♪ so how will you make the money you need? ♪

1069
01:25:56,422 --> 01:25:59,964
♪ You use the skill you have and you will succeed. ♪

1070
01:26:00,104 --> 01:26:03,403
And where do you think you can
earn the most money for your skills?

1071
01:26:04,083 --> 01:26:07,606
I'm afraid that would be your
great enemy, Wonderland Theme Park.

1072
01:26:07,953 --> 01:26:10,279
They tell me that you'll get benefits too.

1073
01:26:11,715 --> 01:26:14,687
Let me just show you the amount of your monthly salary.

1074
01:26:16,097 --> 01:26:21,042
And of course I will be the only one who
knows you as raccoons. It'll be our little secret.

1075
01:26:25,788 --> 01:26:27,679
So, how about a little snack?

1076
01:26:28,056 --> 01:26:30,857
It's not good to make big decisions on an empty stomach.

1077
01:26:31,359 --> 01:26:34,482
I've heard such fabulous things
about the food on Shikoku Island.

1078
01:26:34,507 --> 01:26:38,608
It must be hard on you, eating the
measly scraps you can find at Tama Hills.

1079
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:40,254
That's not important to me.

1080
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:43,008
I'm concerned about this.

1081
01:26:43,789 --> 01:26:46,901
The raccoons who can transform can live as humans,

1082
01:26:47,174 --> 01:26:49,757
but what happens to the raccoons who can't transform?

1083
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:52,475
Those who can't transform will
have to fend for themselves.

1084
01:26:52,615 --> 01:26:56,969
It's sad but only the fittest can survive
in order for the species to continue.

1085
01:26:58,098 --> 01:27:01,912
We foxes were also forced to
abandon those who couldn't transform.

1086
01:27:02,131 --> 01:27:04,719
So, they all died.

1087
01:27:04,837 --> 01:27:07,877
Yes. We had no other choice.

1088
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:13,601
Ah! It's not fair!

1089
01:27:15,016 --> 01:27:20,186
Look on the bright side, you raccoons
unlike us foxes can eat just about anything.

1090
01:27:20,470 --> 01:27:22,547
Those who can transform might do all right.

1091
01:27:23,694 --> 01:27:29,750
<i>Meanwhile, the elders gathered at the temple to consider
what might be done to improve their depressing situation.</i>

1092
01:27:36,424 --> 01:27:39,191
We'll ferry you back to an era of greatness.

1093
01:27:39,915 --> 01:27:43,330
We were idiots to think those old geezers
could help us out in the first place.

1094
01:27:43,651 --> 01:27:46,266
Mmm, reminds me of the saying,...

1095
01:27:46,291 --> 01:27:49,240
"Don't sell the pelt till you caught the raccoon."

1096
01:27:49,513 --> 01:27:54,174
Now, no one could have anticipated
the outcome of Operation Spector.

1097
01:27:54,596 --> 01:27:57,255
You shouldn't blame the masters for what happened.

1098
01:27:57,507 --> 01:28:00,850
Why don't humans respect us?
They never say "Sly as a raccoon."

1099
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:03,031
They all say "Sly as a fox."

1100
01:28:03,292 --> 01:28:04,250
Isn't that weird?

1101
01:28:04,605 --> 01:28:08,044
You're worried about stupid
human sayings at a time like this?!?

1102
01:28:08,093 --> 01:28:11,554
No, Gonta, I'm just saying that
we need to study the humans a bit.

1103
01:28:11,585 --> 01:28:15,640
Shut up! It's Time To Challenge All
The Humans To A Fight To The Death!

1104
01:28:15,693 --> 01:28:17,387
Control yourself, Gonta!

1105
01:28:17,813 --> 01:28:23,980
It seems to me that we raccoons have finally
come to a point where we've absolutely no choice.

1106
01:28:24,091 --> 01:28:28,595
We must reveal to the humans that we
were the ones who stage Operation Spector.

1107
01:28:28,735 --> 01:28:30,595
Have you lost your mind, Osho?

1108
01:28:30,620 --> 01:28:34,310
We can't let the human know. That's
an ironclad rule. You know that.

1109
01:28:34,459 --> 01:28:38,467
She's a right, Osho, if the humans find
out about our transformation abilities,

1110
01:28:38,492 --> 01:28:40,453
they'll never stop hunting us down.

1111
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:43,285
Yes but, it's just not fair.

1112
01:28:43,503 --> 01:28:47,711
Somebody else got the recognition
for our spectacular masterpiece!

1113
01:28:50,232 --> 01:28:55,907
I just can't take it, I wanna scream! We Raccoons Did It!

1114
01:28:58,475 --> 01:29:02,538
Osho, what could we do to convince
the humans that we were responsible?

1115
01:29:02,832 --> 01:29:05,811
We would need to get the message out to the whole world.

1116
01:29:06,130 --> 01:29:09,637
We can write to the television stations or the newspapers.

1117
01:29:10,878 --> 01:29:14,895
Yeah but, the humans were just think
that it was somebody playing another prank.

1118
01:29:14,959 --> 01:29:18,335
Then one of us could go on TV and prove it to them.

1119
01:29:18,477 --> 01:29:22,297
Ah, give me a break. It's like Operation Spector.

1120
01:29:22,322 --> 01:29:24,705
They'll think it's staged and we'll be exploited again.

1121
01:29:25,005 --> 01:29:27,298
See, were just wasting time.

1122
01:29:27,323 --> 01:29:28,566
<i>Gonta was right.</i>

1123
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:33,752
<i>The debate dragged on until morning
and still they didn't have a solution.</i>

1124
01:29:35,316 --> 01:29:37,567
See, just wasting time.

1125
01:29:37,990 --> 01:29:44,680
But if we run out into the world and start attacking
the humans, they're going to turn on us and wipe us out.

1126
01:29:44,705 --> 01:29:48,004
We won't let them know it was us.
How many times do I have to tell you.

1127
01:29:48,038 --> 01:29:50,661
Something that's small won't be effective.

1128
01:29:55,333 --> 01:29:58,989
Oroku's right the only answer is to do something big.

1129
01:29:59,494 --> 01:30:04,183
I think that we need to regroup and
launch another even bigger Operation Spector.

1130
01:30:06,237 --> 01:30:10,526
What makes you so sure things won't
turn out just like last time, Shoukichi.

1131
01:30:11,015 --> 01:30:13,716
Because, all of us have experienced now.

1132
01:30:13,741 --> 01:30:15,123
We can do it even better.

1133
01:30:15,148 --> 01:30:18,731
Huh, you are just stalling because you're afraid to fight.

1134
01:30:19,302 --> 01:30:22,438
If I didn't know better, I'd think you are a little girl.

1135
01:30:22,991 --> 01:30:25,046
Don't make fun of girls, Gonta.

1136
01:30:25,365 --> 01:30:27,008
I'll show you how girls fight.

1137
01:30:27,033 --> 01:30:30,648
All I meant was that if he were
a girl he'd be the sissy kind.

1138
01:30:30,673 --> 01:30:34,784
Yeah well, this sissy is gonna start
getting ready for Operation Specter Part II.

1139
01:30:35,190 --> 01:30:37,332
By yourself? No one gonna listen to you.

1140
01:30:38,005 --> 01:30:40,040
What! You think they'll follow you?

1141
01:30:40,284 --> 01:30:42,458
Shut up you!

1142
01:30:44,255 --> 01:30:45,527
Hey, break it up!

1143
01:30:48,803 --> 01:30:49,948
Listen everyone…

1144
01:30:50,951 --> 01:30:53,591
I have a proposition. Please take a seat.

1145
01:30:55,604 --> 01:31:01,559
All we have to do is use our transformation
skills the same way we did for Operation Specter.

1146
01:31:02,174 --> 01:31:06,176
Operation Specter clearly overwhelmed
the humans and won their admiration.

1147
01:31:07,021 --> 01:31:12,712
So much so indeed that a human being is
tried to claim responsibility for our great work!

1148
01:31:13,236 --> 01:31:15,961
So, how could we possibly benefit from this?

1149
01:31:19,728 --> 01:31:21,893
How can you make an egg a stand on end?

1150
01:31:23,564 --> 01:31:24,636
Sound impossible?

1151
01:31:25,263 --> 01:31:26,991
This is how Columbus did it.

1152
01:31:31,565 --> 01:31:32,813
So that's it!

1153
01:31:33,942 --> 01:31:36,240
He must have a very clever solution.

1154
01:31:38,279 --> 01:31:43,261
The solution is, from this day
forward we'll be living as human beings.

1155
01:31:44,656 --> 01:31:46,049
That's stupid.

1156
01:31:46,264 --> 01:31:49,633
Now hold on. You should all take a moment to consider it.

1157
01:31:49,810 --> 01:31:52,177
Yeah but, what about the ones who can't transform?

1158
01:31:53,063 --> 01:31:54,239
This is stupid.

1159
01:31:54,685 --> 01:31:58,039
From the Tama Hills Raccoons.

1160
01:32:00,008 --> 01:32:06,774
<i>The raccoons were incensed by Kinchou's proposal. Without
Osho, things quickly fell apart and the meeting adjourned.</i>

1161
01:32:07,421 --> 01:32:11,811
<i>For months now Operation Spector had
taken precedence over preparing for winter.</i>

1162
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:15,193
<i>The raccoons scrambled to find food for their families.</i>

1163
01:32:15,585 --> 01:32:20,782
<i>But Gonta spent his time rounding up raccoons
who wanted to participate in guerrilla warfare.</i>

1164
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:26,751
<i>Master Hage rounded up the raccoons who couldn't
transform and started a Buddhist dancing cult.</i>

1165
01:32:27,329 --> 01:32:30,640
<i>At 999, the raccoon had finally gone senile.</i>

1166
01:32:31,298 --> 01:32:34,125
♪ I'll have to make a boat and sail to heaven instead. ♪

1167
01:32:34,162 --> 01:32:37,196
♪ If you would like to join me just jump in my boat. ♪

1168
01:32:37,323 --> 01:32:40,380
♪ Come sail us to Nirvana
with my Buddhist chanting tout. ♪

1169
01:32:40,927 --> 01:32:42,476
Well, that's a depressing sight.

1170
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:44,626
Hage has been mentally sound for all these years,

1171
01:32:44,651 --> 01:32:48,496
and he spends a few months in Tokyo
and he's completely lost his mind.

1172
01:32:49,365 --> 01:32:51,568
Tokyo is a strange place, Tamasaburou.

1173
01:32:51,593 --> 01:32:53,636
I don't understand the people here at all.

1174
01:32:53,706 --> 01:32:58,187
If we were to have executed Operation Specter on
Shikoku Island it would have worked beautifully.

1175
01:32:58,993 --> 01:33:01,164
Offerings at our temple would have tripled.

1176
01:33:01,914 --> 01:33:07,710
Master Kinchou, please take me back with you to
Shikoku Island and train me to following your footsteps.

1177
01:33:08,317 --> 01:33:09,876
There's nothing that would value more.

1178
01:33:11,528 --> 01:33:14,036
I see. Tamasaburou?

1179
01:33:14,155 --> 01:33:14,688
Yes?

1180
01:33:15,596 --> 01:33:18,081
Do you honestly wish to become my successor?

1181
01:33:18,278 --> 01:33:20,008
Yes, Master Kinchou.

1182
01:33:20,275 --> 01:33:22,301
I've been hoping you would say that.

1183
01:33:23,272 --> 01:33:25,481
However, you must assure me...

1184
01:33:26,099 --> 01:33:28,488
that you're not making a selfish decision,

1185
01:33:28,776 --> 01:33:32,412
and abandoning your fellow raccoons
just to get back to my daughter.

1186
01:33:33,109 --> 01:33:33,759
Are you?

1187
01:33:33,784 --> 01:33:35,035
Of course not master!

1188
01:33:36,020 --> 01:33:36,649
Only…

1189
01:33:36,850 --> 01:33:38,865
Only what? Tell me.

1190
01:33:40,301 --> 01:33:43,541
Even you Master Kinchou have lost
the support of the other raccoons.

1191
01:33:44,012 --> 01:33:46,336
So what good can we achieve by staying here?

1192
01:33:46,441 --> 01:33:49,032
There is something. Come with me.

1193
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:59,298
Wow, what an amazing place!

1194
01:33:59,463 --> 01:34:04,739
Do you like it? The people that you're about to
employ assured me that this visit would be memorable.

1195
01:34:10,431 --> 01:34:12,295
Look, I'm everywhere!

1196
01:34:13,795 --> 01:34:16,801
Unbelievable! This is worth every dime.

1197
01:34:36,674 --> 01:34:43,118
<i>And so the raccoons of Tama Hills not only got their
revenge on the credit stealing Wonderland president,</i>

1198
01:34:43,479 --> 01:34:47,247
<i>they also obtained a substantial
sum to finance future operations.</i>

1199
01:34:47,843 --> 01:34:53,709
<i>The president ran to the authorities to report the
theft of 1 million dollars by a pack of raccoons...</i>

1200
01:34:54,011 --> 01:34:56,292
<i>But this time no one would listen to him.</i>

1201
01:34:57,146 --> 01:35:02,355
<i>Meanwhile, Gonta and his crew of rebels were taking
various steps to prevent further clearing of the forest.</i>

1202
01:35:20,710 --> 01:35:21,699
Are you okay?

1203
01:35:23,873 --> 01:35:26,012
Attention all environmentalists...

1204
01:35:26,037 --> 01:35:31,126
you must not interfere with our attempts to
exterminate this snakes in the Tama Hills area.

1205
01:35:31,669 --> 01:35:33,780
If you do not leave the area immediately,

1206
01:35:33,870 --> 01:35:39,299
you'll be subject to prosecution for
trespassing... and for possession of dangerous weapons.

1207
01:35:39,362 --> 01:35:40,803
This is your last warning.

1208
01:35:42,041 --> 01:35:46,751
Leave the area now or you will
be a arrested and removed by force.

1209
01:36:00,422 --> 01:36:03,618
<i>But Gonta and his army of rebels refuse to budge.</i>

1210
01:36:04,036 --> 01:36:09,197
<i>They're threatening tactics kept the police,
snake exterminators, and construction workers at bay.</i>

1211
01:36:09,694 --> 01:36:13,484
<i>Even as night fell both parties remained at an impasse.</i>

1212
01:36:19,756 --> 01:36:22,915
Don't just sit there. Gonta's out there risking his life.

1213
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:24,986
We all need to get out there and help him.

1214
01:36:28,230 --> 01:36:34,106
Can't you hear that? The riot police
are already here. It's too late, Shoukichi.

1215
01:36:39,573 --> 01:36:41,154
I'm gonna see what I can do!

1216
01:36:41,972 --> 01:36:43,092
I'm coming with you!

1217
01:36:57,044 --> 01:36:58,145
Are we ready?

1218
01:36:58,170 --> 01:36:58,878
Yes!

1219
01:36:59,611 --> 01:37:01,957
Now, let's hear the kamikaze motto.

1220
01:37:02,581 --> 01:37:07,704
"Even if we should fall in the heat of
battle. Our deaths will not be in vain.

1221
01:37:08,052 --> 01:37:13,113
Our sacrifice is certain to rally our
brothers to fight on until the day of victory."

1222
01:37:13,343 --> 01:37:15,172
That is the kamikaze spirit.

Gonta! Wait!

1228
01:37:32,408 --> 01:37:33,209
Don't do this!

1229
01:37:33,842 --> 01:37:34,967

1230
01:37:51,813 --> 01:37:52,557
Gonta.

1231
01:38:32,603 --> 01:38:37,349
<i>Although Gonta and the rebels fought
bravely, their battle did end with their deaths.</i>

1232
01:38:39,714 --> 01:38:40,588

1233
01:38:41,597 --> 01:38:44,157
Mr. Raccoon, Mr. Raccoon.

1234
01:38:44,252 --> 01:38:49,442
Meanwhile, in another part of Tama Hills,
a television reporter and his crew arrived.

1235
01:38:49,445 --> 01:38:50,583
Mr. Raccoon?

1236
01:38:50,856 --> 01:38:53,188
Please come out there's no need to be afraid.

1237

Feel free to take whatever form
with which you feel most comfortable.

1238
01:38:57,771 --> 01:39:01,805
I and the entire staff of Action 8 News are on your side.

1239
01:39:02,038 --> 01:39:03,255
We're your friends.

1240
01:39:06,523 --> 01:39:08,845
Apparently they're hesitant to show themselves.

1243
01:39:20,576 --> 01:39:22,153
Unbelievable! They answered!

1244
01:39:22,319 --> 01:39:24,563
So, the raccoon's letter we received was indeed real!

1245
01:39:26,163 --> 01:39:30,842
Please come out raccoons! We've read your letter
and we want the world to know all about your troubles.

1246
01:39:31,745 --> 01:39:35,478
There they are! There they are! Raccoons! Raccoons! Wait!

1247
01:39:35,644 --> 01:39:38,952
Just tell us, are you raccoons
responsible for the Wonderland parade?

1248
01:39:39,919 --> 01:39:41,786
Of course we are!

1249
01:39:42,470 --> 01:39:47,716
Can you give us some proof. Why don't you
transform yourselves into something for our viewers.

1250
01:39:48,228 --> 01:39:50,243
Otherwise no one will believe you.

1251
01:39:51,592 --> 01:39:54,896
Not every raccoon can transform into something else.

1252
01:39:55,121 --> 01:39:59,685
That's why if our woods disappear
will not know where to go.

1253
01:40:07,570 --> 01:40:09,674
Raccoons, listen, please.

1254
01:40:10,127 --> 01:40:14,229
If you don't give us some form of prove,
this news report will look like it's a hoax.

1255
01:40:15,702 --> 01:40:18,648
Aren't you the ones who requested
this interview in your letter?

1256
01:40:19,297 --> 01:40:21,796
This is for your own good.

1257
01:40:22,865 --> 01:40:23,695
Osho?

1258
01:40:25,285 --> 01:40:29,018
We have no choice. I think it's time
that we tell the humans everything.

1259
01:40:37,275 --> 01:40:39,061
He came out! He came out!

1260
01:40:39,295 --> 01:40:42,026
A ceramic raccoon figurine is walking towards me…

1261
01:40:51,959 --> 01:40:54,303
Mr. Raccoon, a-a-a word for our viewers?

1262
01:40:56,184 --> 01:41:01,138
We'd like to say... That we were ah…

1263
01:41:01,163 --> 01:41:01,791
Yes?

1264
01:41:05,782 --> 01:41:06,418
Go on.

1265
01:41:07,590 --> 01:41:08,450
Oroku!

1266
01:41:13,390 --> 01:41:16,468
WE WERE THE ONES WHO PUT ON THAT PARADE!

1267
01:41:16,493 --> 01:41:18,627
The forest of Tama Hills are our home.

1268
01:41:19,191 --> 01:41:20,977
So, you can't keep destroying them all.

1269
01:41:21,856 --> 01:41:24,774
This plea is from every living creature in the forest.

<i>Master Hage the last surviving witness of
the age of the samurai was 999 years old.</i>

1274
01:42:30,584 --> 01:42:34,650
<i>Over the years he had earned many
honors and seen many fascinating sites.</i>

1275
01:42:35,226 --> 01:42:39,904
<i>But now he had seen enough and he
decided to bid the world farewell.</i>

1276
01:42:40,957 --> 01:42:45,840
<i>With a song of triumph the raccoons
stretched Master Hage's pouch to the limit,</i>

1277
01:42:46,230 --> 01:42:48,481
<i>and turned it into a magnificent ship,</i>

1278
01:42:48,595 --> 01:42:52,597
<i>trimmed with gold, and loaded
to the hilt with exotic treasure.</i>

1279
01:42:53,726 --> 01:42:59,128
<i>Dreaming of their heavenly destination a
large number of raccoons who couldn't transform...</i>

1280
01:42:59,416 --> 01:43:01,404
<i>boarded Master Hage's great ship.</i>

1281
01:43:01,882 --> 01:43:06,738
<i>They danced and sang in joyous celebration
of leaving this world of suffering behind.</i>

1282
01:43:12,582 --> 01:43:16,797
<i>And so, on that kind of moonlit
night that Master Hage adored,</i>

1283
01:43:17,544 --> 01:43:20,217
<i>the ship set sail down the Tama Hills river,</i>

1284
01:43:20,707 --> 01:43:23,050
<i>pulled along by a balmy breeze.</i>

1285
01:43:24,178 --> 01:43:27,935
<i>Gently the raccoons drifted off towards Nirvana.</i>

1286
01:43:38,277 --> 01:43:40,461
<i>They partied like never before.</i>

1287
01:43:40,857 --> 01:43:45,342
<i>And the Pom Poko sound of the raccoons
beating on their bellies like drums...</i>

1288
01:43:45,616 --> 01:43:49,472
<i>could be heard throughout the Tama
Hills until the wee hours of the night.</i>

1289
01:43:54,279 --> 01:43:57,358
<i>Although they knew the raccoons aboard a ship were happy,</i>

1290
01:43:57,476 --> 01:44:00,732
<i>the raccoons who were left
behind could do nothing but weep.</i>

1291
01:44:01,516 --> 01:44:06,967
<i>As if in a dream, the ship sailed
past forests and fields shrouded in mist.</i>

1292
01:44:07,528 --> 01:44:13,198
<i>The raccoons aboard the ship strained to see through
the fog and catch a glimpse of their glorious destination.</i>

1293
01:44:13,686 --> 01:44:18,481
<i>Despite the fact that the closer they got
to paradise, the closer they were to death.</i>

1294
01:44:20,409 --> 01:44:23,645
<i>And so the ship crossed over to the next world,</i>

1295
01:44:23,947 --> 01:44:28,593
<i>and the raccoons sailed away on a
trip from which they would never return.</i>

1296
01:44:30,288 --> 01:44:31,277
Bye!

1297
01:44:34,655 --> 01:44:38,362
Well, I guess we're no match for the humans.

1298
01:44:59,878 --> 01:45:02,792
Bunta? Bunta, is that you?

1299
01:45:03,578 --> 01:45:04,284
Bunta!

1300
01:45:04,953 --> 01:45:05,702
Bunta!

1301
01:45:05,992 --> 01:45:07,087
Tamasaburou!

1302
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:07,986
It's Bunta!

1303
01:45:08,023 --> 01:45:09,352
It's good to see you.

1304
01:45:10,864 --> 01:45:11,730
You made it!

1305
01:45:12,094 --> 01:45:13,031
Welcome home.

1306
01:45:13,375 --> 01:45:15,399
Sasuke! Shoukichi!

1307
01:45:15,424 --> 01:45:20,735
How was your journey, Bunta? Were you able to reach
Sado Island and locate their Transformation Master?

1308
01:45:21,287 --> 01:45:26,214
Yes sir, however, my news is quite grim.

1309
01:45:26,372 --> 01:45:30,872
Many years ago when food was
scarce he was… killed by a hunter.

1310
01:45:31,475 --> 01:45:32,386
How sad…

1311
01:45:33,688 --> 01:45:35,316
I was looking forward to meeting him.

1312
01:45:36,059 --> 01:45:38,920
I'm very proud of you, Bunta.

1313
01:45:44,352 --> 01:45:46,532
So, what has been happening to our forest?

1314
01:45:47,236 --> 01:45:49,546
It's only been three years. I feel like Rip Van Winkle!

1315
01:45:50,593 --> 01:45:52,684
We did everything we could to try and stop it.

1316
01:45:52,842 --> 01:45:54,688
But every inch of the woods has changed!

1317
01:45:54,943 --> 01:45:56,644
How could the land be so transformed?

1318
01:45:56,757 --> 01:45:59,247
We're so sorry. This must come as quite a shock.

1319
01:45:59,272 --> 01:46:01,359
So the humans did all this themselves.

1320
01:46:01,404 --> 01:46:04,487
That's right. They transformed all of Tama Hills.

1321
01:46:04,512 --> 01:46:07,710
But how! Only raccoon should be able to do that!

1322
01:46:08,375 --> 01:46:09,831
We're the only ones!

1323
01:46:11,033 --> 01:46:13,358
Who do you think you are, you stupid humans!

1324
01:46:13,501 --> 01:46:16,472
Raccoons are the ones who transform
things! How could you do this!

1325
01:46:16,606 --> 01:46:17,995
How could you do this!

1326
01:46:19,513 --> 01:46:23,181
The only way this makes any sense
is if all you humans are raccoons!

1327
01:46:23,206 --> 01:46:26,429
You're all stupid, evil, selfish, raccoons!

1328
01:46:29,002 --> 01:46:30,734
No!

1329
01:46:40,322 --> 01:46:41,814
How about one last try?

1330
01:46:42,746 --> 01:46:47,094
Let's use whenever strength we have left
to put Tama Hills back the way that it was.

1331
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:53,593
That's an idea. We'll show those humans
the right way to transform this land.

1332
01:46:53,804 --> 01:46:56,645
Mmm, that sounds like fun.

1333
01:46:56,986 --> 01:47:00,665
I can remember every last little
detail of the way things used to be.

1334
01:47:00,729 --> 01:47:04,646
Oh yes! Time for one last gorilla attack!

1335
01:47:04,966 --> 01:47:08,462
But, it's already too late. It won't do any good.

1336
01:47:08,796 --> 01:47:11,613
Oh, it'll be fun. Let's have some fun!

1337
01:47:11,999 --> 01:47:17,187
Good idea. It's our playful spirit that
keeps us raccoons and that's what really matters.

1338
01:47:17,351 --> 01:47:17,873
Right?

1339
01:47:18,299 --> 01:47:20,910
Yeah, so then will you give us a hand, Kinchou?

1340
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:25,843
Yes, of course. Although it may
end up looking like my home instead.

1341
01:47:26,097 --> 01:47:26,870
Ponkichi?

1342
01:47:27,220 --> 01:47:28,218
Here I am!

1343
01:47:28,498 --> 01:47:30,347
Want me to round up all the raccoons?

1344
01:47:30,490 --> 01:47:32,523
Yeah, you mind lending us some energy?

1345
01:47:32,612 --> 01:47:33,867
No problem.

1346
01:48:44,781 --> 01:48:45,755
Hey look!

1347
01:48:47,037 --> 01:48:47,673
What is it?

1348
01:49:29,503 --> 01:49:30,773
Wait for me!

1349
01:49:44,944 --> 01:49:47,584
Oh, that looks just like my mother.

1350
01:49:50,235 --> 01:49:52,314
Yoshi? It's Yoshi!

1351
01:49:54,172 --> 01:49:55,441
Yoshi!

1352
01:49:59,081 --> 01:50:00,559
Yoshi!

1353
01:50:22,437 --> 01:50:25,305
That's us! That's us when we were cubs!

1354
01:50:32,187 --> 01:50:33,621
Hey! Raccoons!

1355
01:50:34,621 --> 01:50:37,091
Aw, there's so cute!

1356
01:50:38,230 --> 01:50:39,531
Aren't those raccoons?

1357
01:50:40,311 --> 01:50:41,796
I wonder what they're doing here?

1358
01:50:41,821 --> 01:50:43,796
They don't usually come so close to the city.

1359
01:50:48,624 --> 01:50:51,342
Hey, wait raccoons! Don't go!

1360
01:50:55,350 --> 01:50:57,271
Aw, they're gone.

1361
01:50:58,110 --> 01:51:00,298
I wish we could have fed them something.

1362
01:51:00,690 --> 01:51:03,986
I wonder if they can change
their form like in fairy tales?

1363
01:51:08,587 --> 01:51:13,317
After that, our last terra,
Manpooku Temple was knocked down.

1364
01:51:13,588 --> 01:51:16,610
And the New Tama development continued without delay.

1365
01:51:18,130 --> 01:51:23,013
<i>Soon residents settle in and the town
became an ideal place for humans to live.</i>

1366
01:51:23,593 --> 01:51:28,219
<i>In fact the hill where the temple stood is
now the most popular section of the development.</i>

1367
01:51:29,288 --> 01:51:34,829
<i>Also, I'm happy to report that revealing
ourselves to the humans did have a positive effect.</i>

1368
01:51:35,591 --> 01:51:38,385
<i>Now humans are concerned about preserving nature.</i>

1369
01:51:38,701 --> 01:51:44,130
<i>And they're setting aside little bits of the
forests that they develop for parks and nature preserves.</i>

1370
01:51:44,786 --> 01:51:51,482
<i>Even the newspapers published articles proposing
various ways to help humans and raccoons to coexist.</i>

1371
01:51:55,397 --> 01:52:00,505
<i>Unfortunately, these changes came too
late for our group of raccoons to benefit.</i>

1372
01:52:01,574 --> 01:52:04,700
<i>Some of us tried moving to the other side of Tama Hills...</i>

1373
01:52:04,974 --> 01:52:10,870
<i>where some forests and farmlands still remained but
there were raccoons already living there of course.</i>

1374
01:52:11,338 --> 01:52:14,025
<i>And with all the construction and traffic in the area</i>

1375
01:52:14,310 --> 01:52:16,609
<i>it was a daily struggle to survive.</i>

1376
01:52:19,714 --> 01:52:23,902
<i>So, we finally gave in and followed Kinchou's advice.</i>

1377
01:52:32,618 --> 01:52:37,696
<i>Those of us who could transform followed in
the foxes' footsteps and started living as humans.</i>

1378
01:52:43,228 --> 01:52:50,274
<i>Some raccoons sold real estate and unable to resist the
money they could make promoted leveling even more forests.</i>

1379
01:52:50,299 --> 01:52:53,380
I got a prime piece of forests
just waiting to be developed.

1380
01:52:56,908 --> 01:53:01,111
<i>I now have a desk job while my
wife Kiyo works at a snack bar.</i>

1381
01:53:01,978 --> 01:53:05,420
<i>but most could barely handle the
stress of living in the human world,</i>

1382
01:53:05,774 --> 01:53:08,820
<i>and they wanted nothing more than to return to the hills.</i>

1383
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:12,772
<i>I'm constantly impressed by the humans.</i>

1384
01:53:13,315 --> 01:53:16,137
<i>It takes a lot of stamina to live the way they do.</i>

1385
01:53:24,208 --> 01:53:30,003
<i>Eventually many of the raccoons quit their desk
jobs and started begging and living in the streets.</i>

1386
01:53:30,862 --> 01:53:37,219
<i>As for Ponkichi and the others who couldn't transform,
they adopted a lifestyle perfectly suited for raccoons.</i>

1387
01:53:37,793 --> 01:53:39,084
<i>They lived for the moment.</i>

1388
01:53:39,826 --> 01:53:45,095
<i>Knowing their lifestyle was dangerous, they
made sure to fully experience life each day,</i>

1389
01:53:45,430 --> 01:53:49,708
<i>and never letting the destruction of their
homes or accidents on the road get them down.</i>

1390
01:53:50,289 --> 01:53:57,445
<i>They had cubs, relaxed, ate,
drank, and died... all too quickly.</i>

1391
01:54:58,786 --> 01:55:00,117
Ponkichi!

1392
01:55:01,692 --> 01:55:02,999
Ponkichi!

1393
01:55:03,024 --> 01:55:04,581
It's Shoukichi!

1394
01:55:08,081 --> 01:55:09,315
You look great!

1395
01:55:09,624 --> 01:55:11,129
No, you look better.

1396
01:55:26,100 --> 01:55:27,551
Shoukichi!

1397
01:55:32,132 --> 01:55:33,688
Uh... Hello.

1398
01:55:33,975 --> 01:55:35,653
Many of you have probably heard.

1399
01:55:35,783 --> 01:55:39,475
Someone on the news saying how animals
are disappearing because of development.

1400
01:55:39,775 --> 01:55:41,170
I don't think that's quite accurate.

1401
01:55:42,247 --> 01:55:46,405
It's true that some raccoons can
transform and disappear although,

1402
01:55:47,195 --> 01:55:50,586
What about things like rabbits and badgers.

1403
01:55:51,375 --> 01:55:53,349
They can't transform, so where do they go?
