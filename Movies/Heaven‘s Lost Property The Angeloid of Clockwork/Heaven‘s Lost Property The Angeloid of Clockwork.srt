1
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,541
Cheep!

2
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:19,791
Oh crap!

3
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:22,125
I totally forgot about
that little chick!

4
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:34,041
Looks like we're cutting
straight to the carnage, huh?

5
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,291
It's your move, Tomoki.

6
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,041
Whoa! Why the
hell is it my move?

7
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:41,041
Maybe it's not, but we got do
something, and quick!

8
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:42,333
What's the plan?

9
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:43,625
If we don't stop this thing,

10
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:46,000
Sorami City won't be
worth a cluck.

11
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,291
Master?

12
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,000
Damn it all!

13
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:51,500
Fine!

14
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,208
If I gotta bust out
the big guns here,

15
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:54,916
then that's what I'm gonna do!

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,708
Yes, Master.

17
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:57,583
I'm ready!

18
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,375
We're gonna choke that chicken!

19
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:02,916
It's time to transform!

20
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:08,375
♪ opening song ♪

21
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:44,458
Hold on!

22
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,333
Why am I the one transforming?

23
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,458
You were born for
this moment, Sohara!

24
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,250
I believe in you!

25
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,666
All right, Tomoki.

26
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,083
If this is my destiny,
then so be it!

27
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:30,166
Pervert!

28
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,000
I am Daedalus.

29
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,250
Mother of the Angeloids.

30
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,875
I graced my creations
with vast potential.

31
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,875
That is their blessing
and burden alike.

32
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,541
Type Epsilon.

33
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:16,875
Chaos.

34
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,250
She fell into
his clutches,

35
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,875
and her soul was
twisted accordingly.

36
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:26,375
Luckily, Tomoki repurposed her,
just as he did the others.

37
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,041
Now they reside on Earth,
living out their days in

38
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:33,208
circumstances that
belie their strengths.

39
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,416
Type Delta, Astraea.

40
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,833
The master of
hand-to-hand combat.

41
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,083
Type Beta, Nymph.

42
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:44,000
The master of
electronic warfare.

43
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,958
And the mightiest and
deadliest of all the Angeloids,

44
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:51,625
type Alpha,
my darling Ikaros.

45
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,083
Unlike the other Angeloids
with which we have

46
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:04,666
filled the Synapse, I created
my daughters to be warriors.

47
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,625
I granted them
the ability to feel.

48
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,166
A double-edged sword
the others do not possess.

49
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:17,541
But like the others,
they do not sleep.

50
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,583
I denied them sleep because
there is a sweetness

51
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,875
to be had in living
the moments of one's life.

52
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,500
I did not want them
to dream their days away.

53
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:36,875
But now, I realize that,
for all my good intentions,

54
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:41,416
I may have doomed my
children to a fate most cruel.

55
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:16,375
I'm Hiyori Kazane,
a high school student.

56
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,750
I live in a sleepy town
tucked away up in the mountains.

57
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,333
It's a darling little
place called Sorami,

58
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:25,625
population seven
thousand, give or take.

59
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,500
There's not much in the
way of excitement here,

60
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,666
but that's why I love it.

61
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:44,916
Two years ago, my parents passed
away at about the same time.

62
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,625
Ever since then, I've earned
my keep tending to the

63
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,875
produce at a local
farm before school.

64
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:00,750
And there he is, Tomoki Sakurai.

65
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,791
He takes this road to
school every morning with

66
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:06,083
Sohara Mitsuki,
his childhood friend.

67
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:09,291
I really love working out here,
but each time they walk by,

68
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,916
I wanna vanish.

69
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,125
I mean, I get so grimy.

70
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:17,000
If he ever saw me like this, I
think I'd die of embarrassment.

71
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:21,333
But he never seems to
notice me, so I guess I'm safe.

72
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:23,625
Oh goodness!

73
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,000
If I don't hurry up and finish,

74
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,208
I'm going to be late
for school again!

75
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,500
I sorta depend on Tomoki.

76
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,083
When he walks by in the morning,
I know it's time to change

77
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,541
into my school clothes
and get moving.

78
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,916
So, how'd you do?

79
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,708
Not that I could ever tell him.

80
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,708
He'd probably think I was weird.

81
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,333
You are such a slacker!

82
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:44,583
I think I could
look at Tomoki all day.

83
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,750
Except, for being
the same grade and all,

84
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,625
we only have one class
together-- Home Ec.

85
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,250
It was my favorite,
even before I noticed him.

86
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,166
I was busy cleaning
veggies one day,

87
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,583
when suddenly he
just dropped into my life.

88
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,000
Aw, balls.

89
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,500
Are you all right?

90
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:05,416
Yeah.

91
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,791
I'm okay.

92
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,458
I should've been watching.

93
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,291
Whoa!

94
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,208
Those green peas
look delicious, huh!

95
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,833
Sorry 'bout launching
'em everywhere.

96
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,875
Y'know, if you
weren't such a spaz,

97
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,666
this wouldn't have happened.

98
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,791
He's clumsy.

99
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,416
Uh, who're you?

100
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,625
I'm Hiyori.

101
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,583
It's nice to meet you.

102
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,250
I'm glad we got
this chance to meet,

103
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,916
even though it took
him running into you.

104
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,541
What?

105
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:35,583
No, it's fine.

106
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:36,333
Really.

107
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,541
Check it out, Sohara.

108
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,750
You ever see green
peas look this tasty?

109
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,250
Oh, no kidding!

110
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,416
They look so plump!

111
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,416
Did you grow these, Hiyori?

112
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,750
You can, hang onto that one!

113
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:48,791
If you want!

114
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:49,500
Yeah?

115
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:50,791
For real?

116
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:54,750
'Cause, you know--
I think--I think those peas

117
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,208
are happy they're going
to be eaten by

118
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,375
someone who
really appreciates them!

119
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,833
Huh?

120
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,583
Forget I said that!

121
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,833
I don't know if
they're happy or not.

122
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:08,083
Well, I'm pretty happy
about it, so there's that.

123
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,041
Thanks again!

124
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,625
See ya 'round!

125
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:16,750
He-- he complimented
my vegetables.

126
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,541
No one had ever
done that before.

127
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,250
The wind is good today.

128
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,958
Although I'm not exactly happy
with the direction it's blowing.

129
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,291
But it won't be a
problem for takeoff!

130
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,708
Don't do it!
You're insane!

131
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,083
You'll die!

132
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:31,500
Hello there, Ms. President.

133
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,625
Good morning.

134
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:35,041
Um, is someone gonna
jump off the roof?

135
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,583
Take a look.

136
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,166
Sugata?

137
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,666
Shouldn't you be
trying to stop him?

138
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,208
I could ask him to come
down but he won't listen.

139
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,791
I'll worry about
it after he falls.

140
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,541
Could you be more irresponsible?

141
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,083
I mean, you're student
council president,

142
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,625
you gotta do something!

143
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,041
If you're talking
about insurance,

144
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,416
I already bought
a whole lot of it.

145
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,375
Several million worth of
life insurance to be exact.

146
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:55,625
Wow, that's a lot.

147
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,208
Don't you stand there,
acting all impressed.

148
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,583
Come on, Prez.

149
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,875
Aren't you two like
childhood friends or something?

150
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:00,875
Shouldn't you be showing

151
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,041
the tiniest bit of
consideration?

152
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,750
Are you suggesting
I'm not worried

153
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,041
about him in the slightest?

154
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,291
No, that's not--

155
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,875
Are you suggesting
I believe it might

156
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,250
not be such a bad thing
to watch my dear friend

157
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,833
plummet to his death with
a big smile spread across my

158
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,333
face as the cherry blossoms
bloom in the background?

159
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,541
I didn't say that.

160
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,416
And are you suggesting
I'm even considering

161
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,166
the remote possibility
that after I've made

162
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,625
my claim on the insurance, I'll
travel the world on the finest

163
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,083
luxury cruise
liner while I mourn

164
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,041
my friend's untimely passing?

165
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:26,958
Are you?

166
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:27,958
What do you think?

167
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,666
Are you sure you
want that answer?

168
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,125
Uh, no.

169
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,375
He jumped.

170
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,750
Be careful!

171
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,583
So, you wanna head back?

172
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,541
Hang on, Tomo.
What about your dream?

173
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,458
I am so not talking to that guy!

174
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,916
What are you talking about?

175
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,375
Tomo's just being stupid.

176
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,625
He wants to ask
Sugata some questions.

177
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,291
We heard he's in
the know regarding

178
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,000
"out there" kinds of things.

179
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,541
You'd be right about that.

180
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,250
He's creepy,
perverted beyond belief,

181
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,583
weird beyond
comprehension,

182
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:08,666
and without a
doubt the freakiest

183
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,041
four-eyed guy I know of,

184
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,041
but he's dependable for
what you need.

185
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,208
Dependably nuts!

186
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,625
Well, who the hell
else are we gonna ask?

187
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,708
I mean you refuse to
go see a professional.

188
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,750
I just want to live
in peace and quiet!

189
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,375
Fine then.

190
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,125
Have it your way, jackass.

191
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,625
Tomoki and Sohara always seem to

192
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,541
have so much fun
when they're together.

193
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,000
Hey, Hiyori!

194
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,708
You don't know what we're
doing in gym today, do you?

195
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,000
No idea.

196
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,875
It wasn't too long
after that when

197
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,125
things started getting
a little strange.

198
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,625
There was this one
rumor going around school

199
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,000
that a girl with wings
had randomly shown up.

200
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,458
Sohara!

201
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,166
Would you at least hear me out?

202
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,166
What are you doing?

203
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,791
Don't follow me, Ikaros!

204
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,250
C'mere!

205
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:03,833
What?

206
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,166
This month I've got
four projects that I--

207
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,333
That very night there
was a story on the news

208
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,583
about people all
around the world spotting a

209
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:38,833
mysterious meteor
shower of girls' panties.

210
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,375
I guess they must have
been flying off the shelves,

211
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,291
too, 'cause when I went
to buy more the next day,

212
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,708
there were barely any left.

213
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,791
Hold up!
It's just meat and potatoes.

214
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:16,666
Huh?

215
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,875
That voice, it's Tomoki.

216
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,625
And I think I taste sugar.

217
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,291
It doesn't make any difference.

218
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,208
Meat and potatoes are the basic
ingredients of curry, right?

219
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:30,000
No, I'm pretty
sure that's curry.

220
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,375
Yeah, wasn't that funny, Sohara.

221
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,208
I know.

222
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,375
Sorry!

223
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,291
It's just, ever since
Ikaros showed up,

224
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,125
it seems there's always
something to laugh at.

225
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,958
I guess she didn't do this
to our dinner on purpose.

226
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,291
Pardon.

227
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,541
Master?

228
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,583
I am curious as to what
you were laughing at.

229
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,208
What do you mean?

230
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,750
We're just laughing
to have a good time!

231
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,250
Isn't that reason enough?

232
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:57,250
I guess that Tomoki joined the
New World Discovery Club.

233
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,291
I'm glad.

234
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,958
It looks like a lot of fun.

235
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:07,708
Maybe if I joined the club my
life would be a little more fun.

236
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:12,291
A new girl transferred in after
that summer vacation,

237
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:16,041
and the boys all went crazy
over how adorable she was.

238
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,708
 Whoa, seriously?

239
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,208
That's a lot.

240
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,250
What are these things, Master?

241
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,041
They're not mine.

242
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,125
They're love letters.

243
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,708
Like from boys.

244
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,416
Love letters from boys?

245
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,541
This is just stupid.

246
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,458
Stop it!

247
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:37,833
Think about the
people who poured

248
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,166
their hearts out
in those letters.

249
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,750
You can't just throw them away!

250
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,000
But that doesn't interest
me in the slightest.

251
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,250
Just read 'em, or at
least take 'em home.

252
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,750
Would it kill you to do that?

253
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,500
Jeez, bug, you're
so annoying sometimes.

254
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,416
So, how did your
morning classes go?

255
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,833
Freaking awful.

256
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,291
How are they doing socially?

257
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,875
Any trouble fitting in?

258
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,750
Judging by the way the
boys are fawning over them,

259
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,958
I'd say they're
adjusting pretty well.

260
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,458
You see?

261
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,541
When did this happen?

262
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,291
The entire school's
talking about the

263
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,791
two cute transfer girls.

264
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,041
Sure didn't take very long
for the news to spread.

265
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,791
This is insane!

266
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,708
Listen up you disgusting bugs!

267
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:18,875
Keep the chatter down!

268
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,041
I'm trying to watch my soaps!

269
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,833
And now, just like bugs,
watch 'em scatter.

270
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,250
Oh!

271
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:28,958
Spank us baby, we're bad boys!

272
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,416
Here are those extra apples!

273
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,833
I hope I brought enough!

274
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:40,833
Thanks!

275
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,333
Y'know, for the
last-minute save,

276
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,333
they've been selling way
better than I thought.

277
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:46,708
Just glad I could help out.

278
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,208
Wow, look at all the
people here this year!

279
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,875
There's cotton candy!

280
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,791
Oh, and takoyaki
and yakisoba too!

281
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,500
All you ever yap about is food.

282
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,041
So?
What's it to you?

283
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,083
If you keep eating
like this you'll get fat.

284
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:01,541
Just kidding!

285
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,500
Forget I said anything!

286
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,791
Hey Nymph.

287
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,125
You want one?

288
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,625
No way!

289
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,666
Yo Ikaros!

290
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,375
Let me know if you want
anything, I'll buy it for you!

291
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,291
Alright.

292
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,000
These.

293
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:22,916
What?

294
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,208
I think one would suffice!

295
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:26,666
Tomo!

296
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,333
Come check out these
other booths with me!

297
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,041
Be right there!

298
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,833
What's all this?

299
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,083
What is a festival exactly?

300
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,791
I believe a festival
is an event that the

301
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,458
entire town can
enjoy together as one.

302
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:47,833
Mikako?

303
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:51,000
That's why we, the Satsukitane
family, have hired a

304
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:54,208
pro to oversee a night of fun
and danger in the woods.

305
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,458
Our hope is that it will
unite the entire town.

306
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,125
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

307
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,708
The rules are simple.

308
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:04,333
We will play a game of
survival using these cork guns.

309
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:08,125
The last person standing will
win a truly fantastic prize!

310
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,083
A fantastic prize, huh?

311
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,625
Ten million yen in
cold, hard cash.

312
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,958
Hey Nymph, are you
getting cold feet?

313
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,958
Just not interested.

314
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,708
Not in the slightest.

315
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,583
Okay, fellow neighbors,
are you ready?

316
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,666
Then let's get crazy
and shoot the

317
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,166
living hell out of each other!

318
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:40,083
May the survival game begin!

319
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,875
What do I do?

320
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,333
I was just standing there,
and they handed me this!

321
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,791
Well, well.

322
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,541
So you're actually taking
a break for once.

323
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:52,875
Yeah.

324
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,833
I was here, anyway,
so I figured I'd let myself

325
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,125
have a bit of fun before
I head back home.

326
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:00,250
I really admire your
work-ethic, you know that?

327
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,500
I'm just doing my part.

328
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:02,666
Honestly...

329
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,666
I enjoy your
salt-of-the-earth gumption.

330
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,000
You're a good catch.

331
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:12,291
You just have to give boys
the chance to get to know you.

332
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:16,708
Boys like, oh-- say-- Tomoki?

333
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,291
You are just too adorable!

334
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:23,250
Now go and terrorize your
neighbors like a good girl.

335
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,958
It's not exactly Cupid's
bow and arrow,

336
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,208
but if you shoot
Tomoki in the heart,

337
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,291
I betcha he'll notice you!

338
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:35,541
Sh-shoot Tomoki
in the heart with this?

339
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,750
I guess Mikako's right, though.

340
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,541
If I shoot him with
a cork, he'll notice me.

341
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,541
At least right then.

342
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,750
I'll do my very best!

343
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,708
Now that's the spirit!

344
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:47,833
Have fun out there!

345
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,583
Raise some epic welts!

346
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,625
To the victor go
the spoils, honey.

347
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,208
My very best wasn't so hot.

348
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,541
The first person I
stumbled across took me out,

349
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,208
so I never did find Tomoki.

350
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,458
Turns out, everyone
really liked the

351
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:18,458
candy apples that night,
so Mikako ordered a bunch

352
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,833
of them for the
Cultural Fair, too.

353
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,333
Hey look!

354
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,416
It's time for the
Cultural Fair again.

355
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,916
Am I supposed
to know what that is?

356
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,416
It's something we do at the
private high school in town.

357
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,875
All the different classes
and clubs set up booths.

358
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,875
They put on plays and concerts,
ya know, stuff like that.

359
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,250
Oh.

360
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,375
Master, will you be taking
part in the fair, too?

361
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,333
No, it's a pain in my ass.

362
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,791
Only way I would is if
my class forced me to join.

363
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,625
Way I see it,
I'm not in any clubs so

364
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,375
why should I even bother?

365
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,416
I've been waiting
for you, Tomoki.

366
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,458
We have a plan in the
New World Discovery Club.

367
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,000
Look... We're currently
recruiting skilled pilots.

368
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,208
Screw you!

369
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,583
Don't say that.

370
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,125
You should be honored to
even be considered given how

371
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,583
many members we
have in the running.

372
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,000
Now wait just a damn minute!

373
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,125
When the hell did I
ever join your club, huh?

374
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,458
Well, according to the
student council registry,

375
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,416
we have you down as
a card-carrying member.

376
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,333
Conspiracy!

377
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,291
Someone's out to
get me, I swear!

378
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,291
Wow.

379
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,125
These poor, depraved children.

380
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,250
What a pathetic
excuse for an event.

381
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,208
Oh look, Yoshitsune, they put a
banner up for the cultural fair.

382
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,750
I'm surprised they
can afford that,

383
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,666
let alone pay for the fair.

384
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,833
Do they even know the
meaning of the world "culture"?

385
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,250
It's those face-turds
from the Academy!

386
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,958
They think highly of themselves.

387
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,208
They don't seem very friendly.

388
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,041
Time to watch the sparks fly.

389
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,125
My goodness, Tsukino.

390
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,583
Are you seeing this?

391
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,958
They're actually making
flowers out of cardboard.

392
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,083
It begs the question;
can these cave-people

393
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,625
demonstrate culture when they've

394
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,041
barely discovered
how to make fire?

395
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,250
Stupid yuppies!

396
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,333
If you're so great,
what the hell are you

397
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,000
doin' for the
festival this year?

398
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,583
Let me guess, something big
and flashy with no character?

399
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,750
We have something
in the works, yes.

400
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:05,041
We will be performing
the classics.

401
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,666
That's the dumbest
idea I've ever heard!

402
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,000
Did you hear that Sohara?

403
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,166
They're gonna put on some
lame-ass boring play,

404
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,875
as if anybody would
want to see that crap!

405
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,833
Why not just play a tape of
Shakespeare while you're at it?

406
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,833
You friggin' rich idiots!

407
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,083
He wasn't referring
to the theatre.

408
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:20,875
You are such a moron, Tomo.

409
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:23,083
He was talking about
doing classical music.

410
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,708
The poor cretin's never
heard of classical music?

411
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:27,416
It almost makes me
feel bad for him.

412
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,625
Come on everyone,
we'd better be on our way.

413
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:33,041
I'm afraid this lack
of civility may infect us.

414
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,041
Way to go, genius!

415
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,166
That big mouth of yours just put

416
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,458
an even bigger target
on our backs!

417
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:38,708
Damn!

418
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,250
They just declared war, Sohara.

419
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,125
Now we have to
do something for the fair.

420
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,041
Yeah, I saw that.

421
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:43,958
Any bright ideas?

422
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,916
Well, we could-- I got nothing.

423
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,083
Attention everyone.

424
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:51,166
The Prez has arrived.

425
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:55,416
As your Class President,
I cannot allow this

426
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,375
injustice to stand
another moment.

427
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:00,541
If they're going to
attack us with music,

428
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:03,416
then we shall
retaliate with music.

429
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,625
What do you say?

430
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:06,208
Wanna start a band?

431
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:08,541
A band, like with instruments?

432
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,791
Come on!
Hurry it up, slowpoke!

433
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,625
They've already started!

434
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:24,125
Sorry!

435
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,750
I hope we can still
find seats together.

436
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,208
The festival's
music competition's

437
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,000
been the talk of the
town for weeks!

438
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:32,250
We now give you the full
orchestra of Sorami Academy.

439
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:35,166
Please, give them
a round of applause.

440
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:59,666
If they don't realize how
poor and underprivileged

441
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,083
they are after this,
they never will.

442
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:06,291
This is what true
culture is all about.

443
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:21,416
Man, that was really good.

444
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,125
I don't know how
we're gonna top that.

445
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,333
Oh man.

446
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:25,666
You know what this means?

447
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,000
The academy's going to
make fun of us again.

448
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:30,125
Hey, don't count us out yet!

449
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,750
We have Tomoki's band this year.

450
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,166
They're bound to be good!

451
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,791
I didn't realize Tomoki
was so popular at school!

452
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,958
Our next act is a performance
by the members

453
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:40,416
of the New World Discovery Club.

454
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,208
Tomoki! Tomoki! Tomoki!

455
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:45,333
Thank you, thank you very much!

456
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:47,208
I can hear the voices.

457
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:48,541
They're calling me!

458
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:51,333
The stage is my life
and now the time

459
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:55,250
has come to show you
all how to rock!

460
00:24:55,333 --> 00:25:00,541
This song is called
"My Tingly Nips"!

461
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:09,250
♪ I perk up
whenever you're near! ♪

462
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:12,958
♪ And it feels so good! ♪

463
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:17,333
♪ You perk up when
you see me, too! ♪

464
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:20,541
♪ Like I knew you would! ♪

465
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:25,291
♪ Is it something God gave
us as part of his plan? ♪

466
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:30,166
♪ I know it's hard, but
don't be afraid anymore! ♪

467
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:36,000
♪ Baby touch my tingly nips
with your gentle hands. ♪

468
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:36,958
♪ Yeah! ♪

469
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:38,916
Tomoki, you know
damn well that's

470
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,458
not the song we decided on.

471
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:41,500
I know, I know!

472
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,666
But it was totally worth it!

473
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:48,416
Wow, that was an easy win.

474
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,125
Thanks so much for
the comedy, ingrates.

475
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:54,125
How fitting for these feeble
peasants to play a novelty song.

476
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:57,041
Unfortunately for them it
has led to our victory.

477
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:59,208
Now that they've seen what
happens, perhaps they should

478
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,791
shut up like the good
future laborers they are.

479
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:02,250
Sorry 'bout that.

480
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:05,333
That was a little bonus,
for the fans.

481
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:06,541
I love you guys!

482
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:07,666
What's this?

483
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,916
Can you believe the
nerve of this guy?

484
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,291
Now it's time for the real song.

485
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:22,666

00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:36,625

00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:19,125
That was amazing!

511
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:21,833
Tomoki is so talented!

512
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:29,583
What?

513
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,541
You don't know how to smile?

514
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:34,666
I was thinking maybe you
could give her some advice.

515
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:49,250
I guess there's
no point in asking

516
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:51,500
someone who
never smiles himself.

517
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:53,458
Come on.
Let's go, Alpha.

518
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:01,416
Oh!
I'm sorry!

519
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,500
I was just admiring
how straight your rows are.

520
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:07,458
I didn't know we had
any garden plots on campus.

521
00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:09,125
And those aren't easy to grow!

522
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:11,666
What's your secret,
if you don't mind my asking?

523
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:15,375
Over the course of my admittedly
brief agricultural career,

524
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:17,000
I've discovered that
vegetables really flourish...

525
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:18,958
So this is Eichiro Sugata,

526
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:21,958
the head of the New
World Discovery Club.

527
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:24,875
Everybody says he's a weirdo,
but he seems to know

528
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:28,416
his way around a garden,
so he can't be that bad, right?

529
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,625
Besides, he's
friends with Tomoki.

530
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:34,333
I'm sure he's just fine.

531
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:39,041
Wow!

532
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,708
They've got so many
stands this year!

533
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,125
Hey, Nymph!

534
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,416
We got this for ya.

535
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,500
You did?

536
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:57,000
I promised I'd
get you something.

537
00:29:57,083 --> 00:29:58,875
Remember, I said if
my booth turned a profit,

538
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:01,208
I'd buy you anything you
liked, and you like these.

539
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:01,958
Oh.

540
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:03,166
That's right.

541
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:06,000
I saw, you had your
eye on these earlier.

542
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:07,916
Plus you've been
kicking ass in the band,

543
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,791
so I wanted to
give you something.

544
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:12,333
Thanks for being awesome.

545
00:30:15,416 --> 00:30:16,333
Thanks?

546
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:18,583
Is that what
I'm supposed to say?

547
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:19,708
Or--

548
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:27,583
Thank you, Master.

549
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:29,208
Thank you so much.

550
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:32,916
Humans are no more than bugs,

551
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,375
simple creatures
who we crush underfoot.

552
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:39,458
Even if he is nice to me,
he's still beneath me.

553
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:45,666
It's so good.

554
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,291
Isn't it?

555
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:53,250
Way to go, Tomo!

556
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:55,291
You made her cry!

557
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:56,625
You little devil.

558
00:30:56,708 --> 00:30:58,291
So wicked.

559
00:30:58,375 --> 00:30:59,916
N--No, I--!

560
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:05,916
What are you doing?

561
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,166
Look Nymph.

562
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,416
The sky here is so vast.

563
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,791
Huh? What does
that even mean?

564
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:14,000
--I don't get it.
--What the heck, Tomo?

565
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:15,500
Did you do something
to upset Nymph again?

566
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:16,333
Don't look at me!

567
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,208
I didn't do anything.

568
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:20,458
Why are you all looking at me?

569
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:21,708
It wasn't my fault!

570
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:23,583
This candy apple is awful!

571
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:24,583
What are you talking about?

572
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:25,541
You just said it was good!

573
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:27,041
Oh shut up!

574
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:37,916
Mikako came out here today
while they were setting up.

575
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,583
Said something about
getting an event ready.

576
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:41,666
Well, I'll be...

577
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,416
You grew all
this yourself, dearie?

578
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,916
Uh-huh!

579
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Tell you what.

580
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:47,708
I'll take one of
them daikon radishes.

581
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:48,875
Great!

582
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:51,166
Thank you very much, ma'am!

583
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:55,541
Huh?

584
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:11,416
He's groping her!

585
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,083
Oh, the humanity!

586
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:15,500
Pants is groping Makiko!

587
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:17,750
I-- I give up!

588
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:24,750
No way!

589
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:26,708
He's already in a tight spot!

590
00:32:26,791 --> 00:32:29,125
The man's face is being crushed!

591
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:31,458
This does not look good!

592
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:33,958
Flying body press!

593
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:41,625
She's reaching--oh!
To catch him mid-air-- Oh!

594
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:45,500
and performs an
Argentine Backbreaker!

595
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,625
--and here's your candy apple.

596
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:54,416
I hope you like it!

597
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,000
Thanks a lot!

598
00:32:58,583 --> 00:33:00,375
Nymph is so adorable.

599
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:02,750
She reminds me of a doll.

600
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:09,166
She's not the only one.

601
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,500
They're all adorable.

602
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:15,875
Why would Tomoki notice
me with them around?

603
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:17,833
I hope he does, though.

604
00:33:17,916 --> 00:33:19,958
I really do.

605
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:22,541
Man, a lot happened
in one night,

606
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,000
but the festival
was fun, wasn't it?

607
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:26,791
Are you sure that's
all you wanted?

608
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:30,500
I said I'd get you anything,
and I do keep my promises.

609
00:33:31,416 --> 00:33:33,250
'Cause the last time
you had a candy apple

610
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:35,416
you said they
were gross tasting.

611
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:37,541
You remember that?

612
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:40,416
Course. You cried over
it like a baby.

613
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:44,208
But I do like them.

614
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:46,750
Candy apples.

615
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,583
I like them a lot.

616
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:55,833
Hey Tomoki, aren't you
going to have one, too?

617
00:33:55,916 --> 00:34:00,000
Nah, I already had a bunch of
takoyaki and other junk today.

618
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:01,708
You don't eat a lot
of sweets, do you?

619
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:03,333
Not really.

620
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:08,208
First snow of the year!

621
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:13,500
Perfect day to
do absolutely nothing.

622
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:15,708
War is hell!

623
00:34:15,791 --> 00:34:19,291
All students, report to the
P.E. field immediately!

624
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:22,125
Two teams--boys on one,
girls on the other!

625
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:23,500
We're going to
duke it out like our

626
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:27,666
ancestors always did
with snowballs!

627
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:32,416
Just like that, all of our
classes were cancelled.

628
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,708
Everyone headed outside for the
most epic snowball fight ever!

629
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:41,333
Your Lordship!

630
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:43,000
What's it gonna be?

631
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,708
The enemy is at Honnoji!

632
00:34:59,708 --> 00:35:01,708
Ready!
Fire!

633
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:26,416
So uh-- Could you do me a favor?

634
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,500
Well that depends.

635
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,250
What do you want?

636
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,458
This is paradise.

637
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:49,458
I haven't relaxed in a hot
spring like this in forever!

638
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:25,125
Hiyori!
You really called it!

639
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:26,791
This place is amazing!

640
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:28,875
I found it recently.

641
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:31,458
I'm just glad you're
having a good time.

642
00:36:32,416 --> 00:36:34,041
It's gonna eat me!

643
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,625
Why'd I even bother
coming out here, huh?

644
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:36,875
Look over there.

645
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:39,291
It's Tomoki, that
pervert from Class C.

646
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:41,625
He's always getting in
some kind of trouble!

647
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:43,041
What a pain in the ass!

648
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:44,125
Oh?

649
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:46,291
But he seems like
such a fun guy.

650
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:49,500
Whenever I see him, I just
know it'll be a good day.

651
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:52,708
I guess-- I, uh-- y'know.

652
00:36:52,791 --> 00:36:54,250
I like him.

653
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:57,333
I've watched the nature channel!
I know what happens next!

654
00:36:57,416 --> 00:37:00,333
This is why I said
fishing is bullshit, man!

655
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:02,458
Whenever Tomoki was around.

656
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:05,875
I just sort of forgot
about everything else.

657
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:10,416
Yeah.

658
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,666
I couldn't deny it anymore.

659
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:15,458
I had really fallen for him.

660
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:22,458
Air!

661
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:26,500
Uh, what are you
doing down there?

662
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:28,708
I heard that veggies get
their food from the dirt,

663
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:30,791
so I figured I'd give it a shot!

664
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:32,208
Huh?

665
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,000
You know, if you're that hungry

666
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:37,291
I could just give you
some vegetables.

667
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:38,125
Yeah?

668
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:38,958
Like for free?

669
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:40,875
Score!

670
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:50,833
These cucumbers are delish!

671
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:55,833
Whatcha gonna do with
all these veggies, huh?

672
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:57,208
Well, I was thinking
of giving them to the

673
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:59,958
animals at school we
keep as class pets.

674
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:02,625
Mikako's always being so nice
to me, I figured the least

675
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:05,166
I could do was help
her out with their food.

676
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,458
Cool!

677
00:38:06,541 --> 00:38:08,291
She's my sensei!

678
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:14,375
It's like an
all-you-can-eat buffet!

679
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:22,916
What's all the fuss about?

680
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Dude, let's go check it out.

681
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:37,833
Oh, Astraea, no.

682
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:48,166
I give it my all, but my
cooking is so plain.

683
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,708
I can't offer these
cookies to Tomoki.

684
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:52,791
I mean, look at them.

685
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,291
Just look at 'em!

686
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,208
Dig in.

687
00:38:57,291 --> 00:38:59,000
As many as you'd like!

688
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:00,833
Thanks!

689
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:01,583
Ikaros?
Care for a cookie?

690
00:39:01,666 --> 00:39:03,833
This smells like tasty!

691
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:08,541
I'm in heaven!

692
00:39:08,625 --> 00:39:10,000
They're delicious.

693
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:11,833
I'm so glad.

694
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:12,958
Hey, I know!

695
00:39:13,041 --> 00:39:14,833
Since you like
watermelons so much,

696
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:17,000
why don't you have
Hiyori teach you about 'em?

697
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:18,541
Her melons are radical!

698
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:19,500
Like for real!

699
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:20,666
Huh?

700
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,750
You said there was
stuff about growing 'em

701
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:23,125
that you still
didn't know, right?

702
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:25,708
Well, this chick is like
the produce whisperer,

703
00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:27,416
so problem solved!

704
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:31,791
If I can be of use,
I'd love to help.

705
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:33,625
Change a few things in
your garden and you'll be

706
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:35,875
growing tons of
watermelons in no time!

707
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:37,333
Trust me!

708
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:41,416
Watermelons by the ton?

709
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:44,166
Yes, please.

710
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,000
I would like that a lot.

711
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:46,875
Hey!

712
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:48,208
What's up?

713
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:50,416
I smelled cookies and
thought I'd check it out!

714
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:53,083
Uh!

715
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:54,375
Yeah have a cookie!

716
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:55,250
Oh no!

717
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:57,041
I don't have any cookies left!

718
00:39:57,125 --> 00:39:57,916
They're gone!

719
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,583
I'm so sorry!

720
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:01,083
Hey, it's fine.

721
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:03,041
I'm sure they were great.

722
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:08,041
See ya later!

723
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:15,791
Tomoki looked at me.

724
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:17,625
He spoke to me.

725
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:20,208
He even smiled.

726
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:24,833
From that moment on,
something inside my

727
00:40:24,916 --> 00:40:27,708
heart began to blossom and grow.

728
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:30,916
Maybe Tomoki and I
could become friends.

729
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,791
Maybe close friends
or even more.

730
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:36,500
My wish set down
roots in my heart and

731
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:40,208
it grew little by little as
I watched Tomoki.

732
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:45,250
I watered it with hope
and he was its sunshine.

733
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:16,208
Oh, cool.

734
00:41:16,291 --> 00:41:18,125
The actress on Barnyard
Sonata is getting married.

735
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:20,083
Remind me to
tell Nymph about this.

736
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:22,166
Sohara, I have a question.

737
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,541
Sure, what is it?

738
00:41:23,625 --> 00:41:26,333
When someone proposes to you,

739
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:28,333
is marriage what
happens afterwards?

740
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:29,125
Yep.

741
00:41:29,208 --> 00:41:30,416
Check it out.

742
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,666
After the proposal,
you have a wedding and you

743
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,041
get to wear a beautiful
dress like this one.

744
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,166
Isn't it gorgeous?

745
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,541
A proposal, then a wedding.

746
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:43,041
What are you talking about?

747
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,166
Nothing.

748
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,333
Maybe the heat's
making you lightheaded.

749
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:48,500
I know! We should
go get some ice cream.

750
00:41:48,583 --> 00:41:51,166
That's the best thing to
do when it's hot outside.

751
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,833
Yeah!

752
00:41:54,916 --> 00:41:57,166
Hiyori!
What's up?

753
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:01,333
Sohara and Ikaros.

754
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:03,375
Uh, good afternoon.

755
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:06,291
If you're not busy, we were
about to go get some ice cream.

756
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:07,666
You wanna come with?

757
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:08,500
Huh?

758
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:09,625
Uh yeah.

759
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:11,375
Thanks.

760
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:16,083
Y'know, I'm glad
we're finally getting

761
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,250
a chance to hang out for once.

762
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:21,000
Yeah, I'm glad also.

763
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:23,000
I've been seeing a
lot of you and

764
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:25,083
your friends around
town this year.

765
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:26,166
Honestly?

766
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:28,375
I'm jealous of how
you all get along!

767
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:30,166
You've been watching us?

768
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:33,500
Whenever you're all together,
you have a lot of fun.

769
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:35,666
Like just the other day,
when you ate curry

770
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,333
in the woods
down by the stream.

771
00:42:37,416 --> 00:42:38,416
You were there?

772
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,458
Aw, how come you
didn't say something?

773
00:42:40,541 --> 00:42:43,833
Because I'm not a member of
the New World Discovery Club.

774
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:45,541
Makes no difference to me!

775
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:47,625
In fact, I betcha Tomoki
would've hollered for you

776
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:49,916
to come over and
fill up a plate.

777
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,333
You-- you really think so?

778
00:42:53,416 --> 00:42:54,708
Course I do.

779
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:57,166
Tomo's always
being nice like that.

780
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,833
I mean, that's basically
what he did with Astraea.

781
00:42:59,916 --> 00:43:02,333
Man, that girl can
really pack it away.

782
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:07,166
I-- I knew that it was
a long-shot, but--

783
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:19,958
If I wanted him to know
I existed, I had to be brave.

784
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:25,625
So the very next day, I marched
right up to that club room.

785
00:43:25,708 --> 00:43:30,916
I was nervous,
but I had to do it.

786
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:36,500
Uh.

787
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:37,750
Hi!

788
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:42,708
I'd like to join the club,
if that's okay.

789
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:44,625
There's Tomoki.

790
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:46,583
He's right in front of me.

791
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:50,583
The boy who turns each
new day into an adventure.

792
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:56,166
He's looking at me.

793
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,416
He sees me!

794
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:15,125
From now, until the day I die.

795
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:20,208
I'm never gonna
forget that girl.

796
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:27,041
My name is Hiyori Kazane,

797
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:29,708
and uh, I'd really
like to join the club!

798
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:30,916
Hold up.

799
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,541
You're not talking about
this club, are you?

800
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:34,833
Yeah, I really dunno
if you wanna do that.

801
00:44:34,916 --> 00:44:37,166
As they say,
the more the merrier.

802
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,458
Isn't that right?

803
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:41,125
You did want more
members, as I recall.

804
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:42,833
Fair enough.

805
00:44:42,916 --> 00:44:44,333
You...

806
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:50,208
Why are you here on Earth?

807
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:51,750
Just think of all the
fun we'll have with

808
00:44:51,833 --> 00:44:53,958
the newest addition
to our money!

809
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:55,416
Huh?
Money?

810
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,750
Size matters, my little friend.

811
00:44:57,833 --> 00:45:00,291
Just one more name
on the official club roster,

812
00:45:00,375 --> 00:45:03,583
and Sugata's operating
budget will skyrocket.

813
00:45:03,666 --> 00:45:04,833
Hiyori!

814
00:45:05,625 --> 00:45:07,166
You've made the right decision.

815
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,458
Stop sparkling!

816
00:45:08,541 --> 00:45:09,375
Whatever.

817
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:10,500
Welcome to the club.

818
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:12,791
Me, I got a whole
lotta nothing to do.

819
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:15,250
There's one tiny detail
I forgot to mention.

820
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:16,416
Huh?

821
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,250
To receive the extra
money for the club,

822
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:20,333
we need to prove
that it's big enough.

823
00:45:20,416 --> 00:45:22,041
Sometimes, a club
will take money

824
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:23,708
that it's not entitled to,

825
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:26,916
and it's my duty as
president to destroy them.

826
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,416
So unless you long for death,
you're going to show up

827
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:33,208
to the New World Discovery
club every single day.

828
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:35,083
Comprende?

829
00:45:38,541 --> 00:45:41,375
We've got plenty more of it,
so please drink up.

830
00:45:41,458 --> 00:45:42,666
Thank you very much.

831
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:43,958
Man, I'm starving!

832
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,208
Hey Alpha, where are the snacks?

833
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:48,416
I will go bring them out.

834
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,875
Now then, I'd like to bring
Hiyori up to speed

835
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:53,083
as to what the New World
Discovery Club is all about.

836
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:55,125
Man, you guys are
harshing my mellow!

837
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:57,833
The bulk of our club activities
concern the discovery of a

838
00:45:57,916 --> 00:46:00,500
hitherto-unknown land floating
in the skies above Sorami.

839
00:46:00,583 --> 00:46:02,041
Damn it!

840
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:05,083
Taking over my house for the
club meeting is totally balls!

841
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:10,250
And this is just the beginning!

842
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:12,541
If I don't do something,
I'm gonna have to deal with

843
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:15,000
these chuckleheads
after school every day.

844
00:46:15,083 --> 00:46:17,416
If I try to skip out they'll
just follow me home and bogart

845
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,750
what little peace and
quiet I have left in life!

846
00:46:21,541 --> 00:46:23,583
Think, Tomoki!
Think!

847
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:25,416
Those are the basics.

848
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,166
That'll do for now.

849
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:28,625
Hiyori.

850
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:29,791
Uh, yeah?

851
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:31,958
So, I've been dying to ask.

852
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:33,541
Are you going out with anyone?

853
00:46:33,625 --> 00:46:36,125
No I-- I'm not seeing anyone.

854
00:46:36,208 --> 00:46:37,416
No one at all.

855
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,208
Aw, you're so innocent!

856
00:46:39,291 --> 00:46:41,125
Not like that pervert,
who drools over

857
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:43,083
half-naked bimbos next to us.

858
00:46:43,166 --> 00:46:44,666
Real classy.

859
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:47,625
What the hell, Sohara?
How come you're singling me out?

860
00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:49,250
He's the grand
master of perversion!

861
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:51,416
Why don't you get up
in his grill for once?

862
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,291
Pay no mind to his lies.

863
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:56,833
Like the Holy Grail of yore,
the New World

864
00:46:56,916 --> 00:47:00,416
can only be grasped by those
who are pure in heart and body!

865
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,000
Sure, it's an afterschool club,

866
00:47:02,083 --> 00:47:04,791
but for me this
is what I live for!

867
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:06,875
As the leader of
this intrepid club,

868
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:10,333
I comport myself as
a bastion of purity!

869
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:13,166
Thank you, don't get up.

870
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:14,166
Son of a--!

871
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,375
What's so great
about purity, huh?

872
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:18,625
Wait!

873
00:47:18,708 --> 00:47:19,500
Purity!

874
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:20,833
That's it!

875
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:24,541
Psst!
Hiyori!

876
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:26,166
Over here!

877
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,875
C'mere--I gotta talk to ya!

878
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:39,750
'Bout time you took the old
entrance exam, dontcha think?

879
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:41,708
I don't know what that means.

880
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:44,291
You heard Sugata
rambling on just now.

881
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:46,208
If you wanna be in the
New World Discovery Club,

882
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:48,166
you gotta have a
pure heart an' junk.

883
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,833
That's why I've devised
a super-scientific test

884
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:52,708
to gauge just how pure you are!

885
00:47:52,791 --> 00:47:55,041
But how do you test for
something like that?

886
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,708
With these!

887
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:02,750
Panties are a purity test?

888
00:48:02,833 --> 00:48:04,083
Huh?

889
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:05,666
Of course they are!
What, are you blind, woman?

890
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:08,208
Forged from the whitest
cotton, these panties

891
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:10,875
represent all that is good
and unsullied in the world!

892
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:15,291
That's why the pure of heart
have no problem doing this!

893
00:48:15,666 --> 00:48:16,750
And this!

894
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:19,291
And this!

895
00:48:19,375 --> 00:48:21,250
So, if you wanna join the club,
you gotta show these

896
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:23,375
panties just how
much you love 'em!

897
00:48:27,333 --> 00:48:28,750
Never gonna happen!

898
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:31,000
Any second now, she's
gonna drop those drawers

899
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:32,666
and run screaming
for the hills.

900
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:35,458
There's no way she'll wanna be
a part of the club after this!

901
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:38,083
Soon as she's gone,
we don't get extra money--

902
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:40,666
and I can go back to doing
whatever the hell I want!

903
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,000
Huh?

904
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,583
What?

905
00:48:53,666 --> 00:48:55,583
Are you outta
your friggin' mind?

906
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:57,291
Am I a member of the club yet?

907
00:48:57,375 --> 00:48:58,416
Not just no!

908
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,583
Hell no!

909
00:48:59,666 --> 00:49:01,000
Aw.

910
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:01,958
C'mon!

911
00:49:02,041 --> 00:49:04,166
That was just part one!

912
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:17,541
Ahem.

913
00:49:22,083 --> 00:49:23,166
Oof.

914
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:24,583
Care to tell me what
that was all about?

915
00:49:24,666 --> 00:49:26,541
Master said to keep you here,

916
00:49:26,625 --> 00:49:28,875
while he and Hiyori
are up in his bedroom.

917
00:49:28,958 --> 00:49:29,583
What?

918
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:30,625
Tomoki.

919
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:32,375
You dog!

920
00:49:33,958 --> 00:49:35,500
And he's off.

921
00:49:37,416 --> 00:49:39,916
Rub-a-dub-dub,
it's chicks in the tub!

922
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,208
What could be more pure?

923
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:44,333
What the hell?

924
00:49:44,416 --> 00:49:45,875
A white school swimsuit!

925
00:49:45,958 --> 00:49:47,875
Can you handle the purity?

926
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:53,750
What the hell?

927
00:50:18,041 --> 00:50:19,416
The usual.

928
00:50:19,833 --> 00:50:21,291
And one for the dame.

929
00:50:21,375 --> 00:50:23,208
Right away, sir.

930
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:40,375
White sushi rice on
a white dish topped

931
00:50:40,458 --> 00:50:42,333
with edible white panties!

932
00:50:42,416 --> 00:50:44,875
This meal is
the ultimate in purity.

933
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:51,250
Thus, it is your final test.

934
00:50:51,875 --> 00:50:53,875
Bon appetite!

935
00:50:54,208 --> 00:50:56,083
No way can a girl do this!

936
00:50:56,166 --> 00:50:58,166
Bye-bye, Hiyori!

937
00:51:10,291 --> 00:51:11,625
Psyche!

938
00:51:12,333 --> 00:51:14,333
I can't make
this girl eat panties!

939
00:51:14,416 --> 00:51:15,208
I mean, look at her!

940
00:51:15,291 --> 00:51:16,875
She's all decent and crap!

941
00:51:16,958 --> 00:51:19,583
Man, and she was
gonna do it, too!

942
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:21,416
What kind of a monster am I?

943
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,166
Surely you didn't
sneak out of the

944
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:26,666
club meeting to feed
this poor girl panties.

945
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,375
You are so dead,
you little pervert.

946
00:51:32,208 --> 00:51:33,250
Would ya look at the time?

947
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:34,416
I'm gonna call it a day.

948
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,000
Hold on, Tomoki.

949
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:39,291
We thought of some other pure
white things you might enjoy.

950
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:41,541
Like a white soap riceball!

951
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:44,708
And a white lightbulb!

952
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,625
And an all-white outfit
that'll rock your world!

953
00:51:48,708 --> 00:51:49,625
Yeah!

954
00:51:49,708 --> 00:51:51,416
Now that's what
I'm talking about!

955
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:57,625
"Rock my world." Oh.

956
00:51:57,958 --> 00:52:00,500
Purity punch!

957
00:52:00,583 --> 00:52:03,458
Purity's bullshit!

958
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:05,750
Now that we've
dealt with his antics,

959
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:07,333
let's make this
official, shall we?

960
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:10,125
Welcome to the New World
Discovery Club, Hiyori.

961
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:12,125
Cheers, everyone!

962
00:52:12,208 --> 00:52:14,791
Sorry about Tomo--he
is such a jackass.

963
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:16,166
That's okay, really!

964
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:18,166
So, tell me--what's
your favorite snack?

965
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:19,333
Keep it coming!

966
00:52:19,416 --> 00:52:20,333
All the mackerel!

967
00:52:20,416 --> 00:52:22,750
I'll eat every last one you got!

968
00:52:25,541 --> 00:52:26,625
Here.

969
00:52:26,708 --> 00:52:27,666
Thanks a lot.

970
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,333
I guess I'll be
needing these, huh?

971
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:31,708
May I?

972
00:52:32,958 --> 00:52:35,250
May I ask for your
assistance sometime,

973
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:37,500
in growing watermelons?

974
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:42,250
Yeah, I would be happy to help!

975
00:52:43,666 --> 00:52:45,791
Master has returned.

976
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:52,166
Hey again.

977
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:53,666
Purity can suck it.

978
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:55,291
Purity can suck it.

979
00:52:55,875 --> 00:52:57,166
Purity can suck it.

980
00:52:57,833 --> 00:52:59,208
Purity can suck it.

981
00:52:59,291 --> 00:53:00,291
Never mind that little perv.

982
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:02,250
Purity's fine.

983
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:03,125
Hey, Hiyori!

984
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:04,875
Do you watch "Barnyard Sonata"?

985
00:53:04,958 --> 00:53:07,416
If you wanna go the
extra mile, we are looking

986
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,708
for someone to fill the role
of Pretty, Sugata's assistant.

987
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:12,166
You gotta try this mackerel!

988
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:14,666
Uh, okay.

989
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:16,375
Purity can suck it.

990
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:17,875
Purity can suck it.

991
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:19,833
Purity can suck it.

992
00:53:19,916 --> 00:53:21,416
Purity can suck it.

993
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,666
Purity can suck it.

994
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:24,458
I'll get you down!

995
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:37,083
It's okay, Tomoki.

996
00:53:37,166 --> 00:53:39,083
You're safe now.

997
00:53:40,875 --> 00:53:42,958
Isn't she just
the sweetest thing?

998
00:53:43,041 --> 00:53:46,000
Seems the new girl
upped the ante.

999
00:53:46,083 --> 00:53:48,875
Yes, I daresay you're right.

1000
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:53,333
Sorry 'bout dinner
running so late.

1001
00:53:53,416 --> 00:53:55,458
No, I-- I had fun.

1002
00:53:55,541 --> 00:53:57,750
Thanks for walking me home.

1003
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:01,166
Hey.
So, I gotta ask.

1004
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:03,833
What possessed you to join
our club in the first place?

1005
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:05,333
Seriously.

1006
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:06,708
I got roped into it.

1007
00:54:06,791 --> 00:54:08,291
What's the appeal?

1008
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:14,333
I guess I just thought that--
that it might be interesting.

1009
00:54:14,416 --> 00:54:16,208
You know?

1010
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:19,625
I mean, actually it's
kind of romantic!

1011
00:54:19,708 --> 00:54:23,750
There's a whole other world out
there, just waiting to be found.

1012
00:54:23,833 --> 00:54:26,958
Just like two people
find each other.

1013
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:29,708
Uh, Tomoki?

1014
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:36,083
Is it okay if we maybe
take a little detour?

1015
00:54:42,083 --> 00:54:44,708
This is my favorite spot
in the whole world.

1016
00:54:44,791 --> 00:54:47,791
Even if I feel
really sad, I look out at

1017
00:54:47,875 --> 00:54:50,458
the town from
here and I feel better.

1018
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:54,541
I love Sorami.

1019
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,333
I never want to
live anywhere else.

1020
00:54:56,416 --> 00:55:01,041
And even if I do someday, it'll
always be home in my heart.

1021
00:55:06,375 --> 00:55:08,791
I've been up here
before, you know.

1022
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:12,125
Actually, I kinda come
up here a bunch.

1023
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:15,208
I guess I always figured
nobody else knew about it.

1024
00:55:15,291 --> 00:55:16,750
Wow, that's neat.

1025
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:20,583
Then we've been looking out from
the same spot all this time.

1026
00:55:21,708 --> 00:55:24,083
You're not the only
one who loves Sorami.

1027
00:55:24,166 --> 00:55:25,500
I've thought it was
a great place ever

1028
00:55:25,583 --> 00:55:27,625
since I was a little kid.

1029
00:55:29,291 --> 00:55:31,375
Especially up here.

1030
00:55:47,083 --> 00:55:48,541
Tomoki?

1031
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:50,333
Um, are you okay?

1032
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:51,583
Oh!

1033
00:55:51,666 --> 00:55:52,375
Sorry.

1034
00:55:52,458 --> 00:55:53,833
Just thinking back.

1035
00:55:53,916 --> 00:55:55,541
There's a whole
new world out there,

1036
00:55:55,625 --> 00:55:57,625
hiding above us in
the night sky.

1037
00:55:57,708 --> 00:56:00,916
Just waiting for someone
to fly up and say hello.

1038
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,666
That's amazing.

1039
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:06,291
I'd really like to see it
for myself someday.

1040
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:13,166
And that was that.

1041
00:56:16,166 --> 00:56:19,875
Hiyori came to the club meetings
every day, like clockwork.

1042
00:56:19,958 --> 00:56:20,791
Meanwhile.

1043
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:23,125
I kept trying to
get her to quit.

1044
00:56:23,208 --> 00:56:27,458
Yeah, she was nice and all, but
I wanted my afternoons back!

1045
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:10,541
I'm taking a picture!
Smile, everybody!

1046
00:57:27,625 --> 00:57:29,958
No way is she doing this one!

1047
00:57:31,375 --> 00:57:33,250
Hey!
No fair!

1048
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:48,333
Tomoki, it's time
to admit defeat.

1049
00:57:48,416 --> 00:57:49,500
What?

1050
00:57:49,583 --> 00:57:50,833
Unless, of course,

1051
00:57:50,916 --> 00:57:53,375
these incessant challenges
serve another purpose,

1052
00:57:53,458 --> 00:57:56,333
and you're actually
showing her that you care.

1053
00:57:57,791 --> 00:57:58,916
What, for her?

1054
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,416
As if!

1055
00:58:05,875 --> 00:58:08,666
You're having the time of
your life up here, aren'tcha?

1056
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:09,625
Uh-huh!

1057
00:58:09,708 --> 00:58:11,125
I really am!

1058
00:58:12,166 --> 00:58:16,416
I've always wanted to soar
through the air, and now I am!

1059
00:58:17,458 --> 00:58:20,166
It's a dream come true!

1060
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:53,625
The weather today is
just perfect, isn't it?

1061
00:58:55,416 --> 00:58:58,500
They dug up another old
farm to build something.

1062
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:02,500
I'm a little sad about
the town changing,

1063
00:59:02,583 --> 00:59:05,458
even though I know
it's all for the best.

1064
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:10,083
The book mentions "pruning,"

1065
00:59:10,166 --> 00:59:12,625
but I am not sure
that I understand it.

1066
00:59:12,708 --> 00:59:15,291
If you really want your
watermelon to be top-notch,

1067
00:59:15,375 --> 00:59:17,583
you get rid of the others
that aren't doing as well

1068
00:59:17,666 --> 00:59:20,750
so that the good one gets
more nutrients out of the soil.

1069
00:59:24,041 --> 00:59:26,791
Whenever I prune,
I end up feeling kinda guilty.

1070
00:59:26,875 --> 00:59:28,250
I know I have to do it,

1071
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:31,416
but it's not the bad ones'
fault they didn't work out.

1072
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,208
So you understand
why I feel that way?

1073
00:59:34,291 --> 00:59:36,875
Oh, I'm so glad!

1074
00:59:37,833 --> 00:59:40,750
Sure they're plants, but I
betcha they have feelings, too!

1075
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:43,500
Poor little watermelon,
all alone!

1076
00:59:44,166 --> 00:59:45,541
Sorry about that.

1077
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:48,333
When it comes to gardening,
I get a little worked up.

1078
00:59:49,916 --> 00:59:51,125
Y'know, Ikaros?

1079
00:59:51,208 --> 00:59:53,250
Getting to sit here and
talk to you like this--

1080
00:59:53,333 --> 00:59:55,041
it's really nice.

1081
00:59:55,416 --> 00:59:57,583
Kinda feel like I'm dreaming.

1082
01:00:00,791 --> 01:00:02,916
Finally got those club
pics developed, huh?

1083
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,083
That blonde with the
cans looks just like me!

1084
01:00:05,166 --> 01:00:07,208
That's 'cause it's you, silly!

1085
01:00:13,791 --> 01:00:16,625
Those two aren't dating
on the sly, are they?

1086
01:00:17,666 --> 01:00:20,125
I mean, they are
together a bunch.

1087
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,916
I spotted him buying
her lipstick the other day.

1088
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
What's that about?

1089
01:00:26,083 --> 01:00:27,375
Get a load of this!

1090
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:29,166
I finally figured out what's
going on with those two!

1091
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:32,750
Tomoki and Hiyori are,
like, totally going together!

1092
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:36,000
If those two really are an item,

1093
01:00:36,083 --> 01:00:37,791
there's something
fishy about it.

1094
01:00:37,875 --> 01:00:38,875
Huh?

1095
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:40,250
I don't know what passes
for pretty among

1096
01:00:40,333 --> 01:00:43,375
the girls down here on Earth,
but I'm gonna assume

1097
01:00:43,458 --> 01:00:45,625
Hiyori is seen as
a pretty good catch.

1098
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:47,208
I caught a big fish once!

1099
01:00:47,291 --> 01:00:48,791
Mikako was just telling me.

1100
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:50,875
On last year's "Who would you
like as a girlfriend?" survey,

1101
01:00:50,958 --> 01:00:52,916
Hiyori ranked number one.

1102
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,375
Why would a girl like
that fall for a perv like him?

1103
01:00:57,458 --> 01:00:59,416
Maybe it's true love!

1104
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:03,791
Or maybe he's got
some kind of dirt on her.

1105
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:06,583
Something like--

1106
01:01:08,458 --> 01:01:11,041
Sure hope these cheesecake
shots never get out!

1107
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:13,041
So, hey, whatcha doing tonight?

1108
01:01:13,125 --> 01:01:14,666
It could happen.

1109
01:01:24,291 --> 01:01:26,458
So, what's for dinner tonight?

1110
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:30,041
I plan to make
meat and potatoes.

1111
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:31,958
Hey, sounds good to me!

1112
01:01:32,041 --> 01:01:35,041
I forget, have you ever had
Sohara's meat and potatoes?

1113
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:36,916
I have not.

1114
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,666
She puts pickled plums
in it--it's really weird!

1115
01:01:40,291 --> 01:01:41,500
Hand 'em over!

1116
01:01:41,583 --> 01:01:43,333
I, uh-- what?

1117
01:01:43,416 --> 01:01:45,916
I can't believe you took
dirty pictures of Hiyori!

1118
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,583
Yeah, and now you're
blackmailing her?

1119
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:49,583
They told me you have
cheesecake, so gimmie!

1120
01:01:49,666 --> 01:01:50,750
Huh?

1121
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:52,166
I don't know what
you're talking about!

1122
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,083
You were real chummy going
home from school together,

1123
01:01:54,166 --> 01:01:55,083
weren't you?

1124
01:01:55,166 --> 01:01:56,208
I was gonna go
shopping--she said

1125
01:01:56,291 --> 01:01:57,750
she wanted to
come along, that's all!

1126
01:01:57,833 --> 01:02:00,750
I totally saw you buy her some
lipstick, so don't even lie!

1127
01:02:00,833 --> 01:02:02,333
Shows what you know,
smarty-pants!

1128
01:02:02,416 --> 01:02:04,208
I bought that lipstick
for me, 'cause I wanted

1129
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:05,875
to turn my nipples
into eyeballs!

1130
01:02:05,958 --> 01:02:07,791
But I needed a girl with
me, so the makeup

1131
01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:09,875
counter lady wouldn't
chase me off again.

1132
01:02:09,958 --> 01:02:12,208
And you gave her a meat bun!
How could you?

1133
01:02:12,291 --> 01:02:14,125
Nah, see, 'cause it's--Wait!

1134
01:02:14,208 --> 01:02:16,708
You're just pissed off 'cause
I didn't give it to you, huh?

1135
01:02:16,791 --> 01:02:19,041
Where're the dirty pictures?
Cough 'em up!

1136
01:02:19,125 --> 01:02:20,791
I'm really not following!

1137
01:02:20,875 --> 01:02:22,166
What do I do now?

1138
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:25,041
If anybody looks over here,
they're gonna see me!

1139
01:02:25,125 --> 01:02:27,250
Just tell me what I did
to make you mad this time!

1140
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:28,791
Oh yeah, like you don't know!

1141
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:32,166
Hiyori and you are
a thing, aren't you?

1142
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:33,166
Huh?

1143
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,750
Oh, Hiyori.
Hello.

1144
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:42,416
You really thought that
Tomoki and I were a thing?

1145
01:02:43,916 --> 01:02:44,833
Hold on.

1146
01:02:44,916 --> 01:02:46,083
Does this mean that--?

1147
01:02:46,166 --> 01:02:49,250
--that you guys
aren't going out?

1148
01:02:50,958 --> 01:02:53,708
Wait, you three were
shouting at me 'cause of that?

1149
01:02:53,791 --> 01:02:55,500
Sorry.
Our mistake!

1150
01:02:55,583 --> 01:02:58,208
Guess we kinda
jumped to conclusions.

1151
01:03:02,333 --> 01:03:03,916
No, this is terrible!

1152
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,500
He's looking at me in
my grubby farming clothes!

1153
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:10,208
Now he's never gonna like me!

1154
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:16,500
Man, these green peas
are making me hungry.

1155
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:18,708
They look awesome.

1156
01:03:18,791 --> 01:03:21,500
But the stuff you grow always
looks awesome, doesn't it?

1157
01:03:21,583 --> 01:03:22,875
Remember when you
gave me some of the

1158
01:03:22,958 --> 01:03:25,000
peas you were cooking
in Home Ec that time?

1159
01:03:25,083 --> 01:03:27,750
Those were easily
the best I've ever tasted.

1160
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:29,166
Hey, I've got an idea!

1161
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:31,958
How 'bout you toss some
of those into dinner, Ikaros?

1162
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,958
You'll join us--right, Hiyori?

1163
01:03:37,875 --> 01:03:40,666
Oh, maybe I shouldn't
take your peas after all.

1164
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:43,083
If the others come over, we'll
only get like one pea each.

1165
01:03:43,166 --> 01:03:44,250
I can do it.

1166
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:48,083
I can tell Tomoki
how I feel about him.

1167
01:03:48,166 --> 01:03:49,666
Tomoki?

1168
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:58,750
I just want to let you know
that-- that I love you.

1169
01:04:15,375 --> 01:04:16,833
She loves me?

1170
01:04:16,916 --> 01:04:18,708
What do I do with that?

1171
01:04:18,791 --> 01:04:20,791
Think, dude!

1172
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:24,500
I don't know jack about love!

1173
01:04:24,583 --> 01:04:27,041
I mean, I love boobs,
but that's different, right?

1174
01:04:27,125 --> 01:04:29,250
She doesn't love me
like I love boobs.

1175
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:30,375
What if she does?

1176
01:04:30,458 --> 01:04:32,416
Or what if she just
plain loves boobs?

1177
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,458
That reminds me of
a dream I had once!

1178
01:04:34,541 --> 01:04:35,416
Wait, that's it!

1179
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,500
I'm just dreaming all this crap!

1180
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,375
Ikaros!

1181
01:04:40,458 --> 01:04:42,541
What is it, Master?

1182
01:04:45,833 --> 01:04:46,458
Ikaros!

1183
01:04:46,541 --> 01:04:48,291
I want you to hit me!

1184
01:04:48,375 --> 01:04:49,583
Huh?

1185
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:50,916
I gotta be sure I'm
not dreaming all of this!

1186
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,791
So I want you to hit me as
hard as you can, dammit!

1187
01:04:53,875 --> 01:04:55,250
All right.

1188
01:05:00,583 --> 01:05:02,833
Uh, you're doing it wrong.

1189
01:05:03,708 --> 01:05:04,666
Guess I'm awake.

1190
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,125
Good times.

1191
01:05:06,208 --> 01:05:07,458
Huh?

1192
01:05:19,375 --> 01:05:24,666
Hey, Alpha, you don't think he's
going to see Hiyori, do you?

1193
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:27,000
He made no mention of that.

1194
01:05:27,375 --> 01:05:29,750
Yeah, why would he?

1195
01:05:29,833 --> 01:05:31,041
Seriously, though,

1196
01:05:31,125 --> 01:05:34,375
Tomoki shouldn't
spend time around Hiyori.

1197
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:36,750
It isn't safe.

1198
01:05:37,708 --> 01:05:40,041
She's not supposed
to be in Sorami.

1199
01:05:40,125 --> 01:05:41,458
You know that.

1200
01:05:41,541 --> 01:05:44,583
And you know what's at risk.

1201
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:56,125
How is Chaos's
recovery coming along?

1202
01:05:56,208 --> 01:05:58,625
Stabilizing her is
a difficult process.

1203
01:05:58,708 --> 01:06:01,625
It is requiring many
subtle adjustments.

1204
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:02,541
Ah, yes.

1205
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,083
I almost forgot.

1206
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:06,208
A girl by the name
of Hiyori Kazane

1207
01:06:06,291 --> 01:06:08,333
joined our club
the other day.

1208
01:06:08,416 --> 01:06:10,625
Which is odd, since I
remember seeing a girl who

1209
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:13,625
looks just like her in a
capsule here in Synapse.

1210
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:16,208
Care to tell me
what this is about?

1211
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:19,500
Not free to tell me?

1212
01:06:19,583 --> 01:06:20,750
Ah.

1213
01:06:20,833 --> 01:06:23,250
May I ask you another
question, in that case?

1214
01:06:23,333 --> 01:06:27,875
Recently, I thought back, to the
day I first laid eyes on Tomoki.

1215
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:29,583
There's no reason
I should have forgotten

1216
01:06:29,666 --> 01:06:33,833
such a day, but without
realizing it, I had.

1217
01:06:33,916 --> 01:06:37,291
Does the Synapse have
something to do with this?

1218
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,208
I wish I could give
you an answer.

1219
01:06:42,291 --> 01:06:44,291
You deserve to know.

1220
01:06:44,916 --> 01:06:46,625
You don't say.

1221
01:06:48,041 --> 01:06:49,833
Where are you going?

1222
01:06:53,875 --> 01:06:58,083
Since answers aren't
forthcoming, I'll find my own.

1223
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:07,208
I'm so sorry.

1224
01:07:08,541 --> 01:07:11,208
It's gotta be tough on you, huh?

1225
01:07:11,291 --> 01:07:14,625
My just saying that.

1226
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:17,625
I'll wait at the overlook,
all tomorrow night.

1227
01:07:17,708 --> 01:07:20,333
I hope you'll come up
and give me my answer.

1228
01:07:20,416 --> 01:07:23,375
One way or the other!

1229
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:38,458
Least I can give her these.

1230
01:08:27,791 --> 01:08:28,666
Nymph?

1231
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:30,500
No!
This is bad!

1232
01:08:35,208 --> 01:08:37,083
The earthbound Hiyori--

1233
01:08:40,166 --> 01:08:42,041
--is dead!

1234
01:08:42,125 --> 01:08:44,083
She's coming!

1235
01:08:44,708 --> 01:08:46,625
It's beginning!

1236
01:08:46,708 --> 01:08:49,500
Our Hiyori will be erased!

1237
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:56,708
Everything about
her will be gone!

1238
01:09:09,208 --> 01:09:10,291
What?

1239
01:09:10,375 --> 01:09:13,666
My memories of Hiyori,
they're vanishing!

1240
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:17,583
I have to get inside the dome
before I forget her entirely!

1241
01:09:17,666 --> 01:09:19,583
That's my only chance!

1242
01:09:37,083 --> 01:09:38,166
This girl.

1243
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:39,250
Who is she?

1244
01:09:39,333 --> 01:09:41,250
Look who's snooping
around again!

1245
01:09:41,333 --> 01:09:43,958
You're not getting away
this time, you little bastard!

1246
01:09:44,041 --> 01:09:45,833
Hold your fire.

1247
01:09:47,041 --> 01:09:49,041
He's a guest.

1248
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:52,750
You must be their former master.

1249
01:09:53,916 --> 01:09:57,250
I saw how you ran for
this building a moment ago.

1250
01:09:57,333 --> 01:10:01,500
That look of panic on your
face was absolutely priceless.

1251
01:10:01,583 --> 01:10:04,125
You must be thinking
of someone else.

1252
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:06,958
How soon they forget.

1253
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:09,083
Not that you had any
choice in the matter.

1254
01:10:09,166 --> 01:10:11,250
It's all been purged.

1255
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:13,083
What's been purged?

1256
01:10:14,458 --> 01:10:16,416
Guess!
Go ahead!

1257
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:20,916
I've outmaneuvered you in ways
you can't even comprehend.

1258
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:23,375
Hey, you two.

1259
01:10:23,458 --> 01:10:24,833
What's up?

1260
01:10:24,916 --> 01:10:27,250
I came out here to meet up
with Hiyori like she wanted,

1261
01:10:27,333 --> 01:10:29,916
but I haven't seen any sign of--

1262
01:10:30,333 --> 01:10:31,375
My head.

1263
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:32,875
It's killing me!

1264
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:34,625
Master, Hiyori is--

1265
01:10:34,708 --> 01:10:38,125
Hiyori said that she can't
make it up here today.

1266
01:10:38,208 --> 01:10:40,041
She'll be coming
back tomorrow, though.

1267
01:10:40,125 --> 01:10:43,250
And she said that
she really hopes

1268
01:10:43,333 --> 01:10:45,875
you'll swing by 'cause
she'll be waiting.

1269
01:10:45,958 --> 01:10:46,791
Huh?

1270
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:48,083
That's weird.

1271
01:10:48,166 --> 01:10:49,666
Well, let's go.

1272
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:51,708
No point in waiting
around here, right?

1273
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:54,250
My head's killing me, anyway.

1274
01:10:55,958 --> 01:10:58,250
Why did you lie to Master?

1275
01:10:58,583 --> 01:11:02,875
'Cause I care about him,
and the truth would hurt.

1276
01:11:04,666 --> 01:11:08,125
It is, by all accounts,
a night like any other.

1277
01:11:08,208 --> 01:11:09,416
Foggy, yes, but not unduly
so for the time of year.

1278
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:10,625
Nymph...

1279
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,500
You told me that it would
hurt him, but I still think

1280
01:11:20,583 --> 01:11:24,000
that maybe we should tell
Master the truth about Hiyori.

1281
01:11:24,083 --> 01:11:26,125
After all, she was his friend.

1282
01:11:26,208 --> 01:11:27,541
Wa-- for reals?

1283
01:11:27,625 --> 01:11:29,666
Did you hit your head
or something?

1284
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:31,750
If we tell Tomoki
the truth about Hiyori,

1285
01:11:31,833 --> 01:11:33,583
he's going to figure
out the rest of it.

1286
01:11:33,666 --> 01:11:35,625
He's not a total idiot!

1287
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:39,875
I know you did it for him,
but he told me once

1288
01:11:39,958 --> 01:11:44,208
that lying was a
very bad thing to do.

1289
01:11:44,291 --> 01:11:47,625
I think he would not want me to.

1290
01:11:48,083 --> 01:11:50,416
So your master
ordered you not to lie?

1291
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:53,458
Even if he didn't call it
an order, that's what it was.

1292
01:11:53,541 --> 01:11:56,750
But he's not my master, is he?

1293
01:11:56,833 --> 01:11:58,708
I'm unclaimed.

1294
01:11:58,791 --> 01:12:00,125
Nymph, I--

1295
01:12:00,208 --> 01:12:01,666
Okay, okay.

1296
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,500
Even though he's just gonna
forget everything

1297
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,250
about her tomorrow anyhow,

1298
01:12:05,333 --> 01:12:08,750
I guess I shouldn't
have lied to him like that.

1299
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,416
Now you've got
me feeling all guilty!

1300
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:15,500
Tell you what--I'll go and make
it up to him right away, okay?

1301
01:12:25,458 --> 01:12:27,083
What the hell do you
think you're doing, Nymph?

1302
01:12:27,166 --> 01:12:28,583
What's wrong, Tomoki?

1303
01:12:28,666 --> 01:12:30,500
I thought you liked this outfit.

1304
01:12:30,583 --> 01:12:31,583
Like it?

1305
01:12:31,666 --> 01:12:33,416
You damn near gave
me a heart attack!

1306
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,750
Come to bed.

1307
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:35,833
Huh?

1308
01:12:35,916 --> 01:12:38,541
I came here to snuggle up.

1309
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,166
So come back.

1310
01:12:46,291 --> 01:12:48,166
Whatever you say.

1311
01:12:55,875 --> 01:12:58,666
Hey, Tomoki.

1312
01:12:58,750 --> 01:12:59,708
That's my name.

1313
01:12:59,791 --> 01:13:02,208
Remember, how you
told me that one

1314
01:13:02,291 --> 01:13:06,291
time that you would
become my master?

1315
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:13,750
I'm ready to imprint,
if you meant it.

1316
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:17,583
Don't do it.

1317
01:13:17,666 --> 01:13:19,416
At the end of the
day, the only one you

1318
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,250
should have to
answer to is yourself.

1319
01:13:22,875 --> 01:13:25,000
That goes for
you and Ikaros both.

1320
01:13:25,083 --> 01:13:26,708
And even Astraea.

1321
01:13:26,791 --> 01:13:28,291
What kind of life
would you have if you

1322
01:13:28,375 --> 01:13:31,125
spend it following
someone's orders?

1323
01:13:31,208 --> 01:13:34,166
You deserve way better.

1324
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:37,416
Freedom is pretty bitchin',

1325
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:40,500
and I want you to
have that, you know?

1326
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:43,500
Having masters isn't all bad.

1327
01:13:43,583 --> 01:13:47,375
Life's complicated when you have
to figure stuff out on your own.

1328
01:13:47,458 --> 01:13:49,083
Look, it's not like I want you

1329
01:13:49,166 --> 01:13:51,916
to be my master
because I'm an Angeloid.

1330
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
It's 'cause-- 

1331
01:13:54,083 --> 01:13:57,208
'Cause I think you're amazing!

1332
01:13:57,291 --> 01:13:59,166
Tomoki, I think that I'm in l--

1333
01:13:59,833 --> 01:14:01,250
Tomoki?

1334
01:14:01,333 --> 01:14:03,000
What the hell!

1335
01:14:03,083 --> 01:14:04,708
Tomoki!

1336
01:14:05,916 --> 01:14:07,916
That's the pain of
memories being zapped

1337
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,458
out of your mind by the Synapse.

1338
01:14:11,166 --> 01:14:14,625
By tomorrow, Hiyori will
never have existed!

1339
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:27,125
Huh?

1340
01:14:27,208 --> 01:14:28,583
What'd you say her name was?

1341
01:14:28,666 --> 01:14:29,541
It's Hiyori!

1342
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:30,833
Hiyori Kazane!

1343
01:14:30,916 --> 01:14:32,333
Geez.

1344
01:14:32,791 --> 01:14:34,833
All that porn's rotted
your brain, Tomo.

1345
01:14:34,916 --> 01:14:36,333
We don't have any new members.

1346
01:14:36,416 --> 01:14:37,625
I think I'd have noticed.

1347
01:14:37,708 --> 01:14:39,333
I've never heard that name.

1348
01:14:39,416 --> 01:14:42,458
And believe me,
I have dirt on everybody.

1349
01:14:42,541 --> 01:14:44,791
Are you sure that this
wasn't just another dream?

1350
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:46,333
Oh, come on!

1351
01:14:46,416 --> 01:14:48,708
She bumped us into a higher
bracket for the club budget.

1352
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:50,666
You practically drooled on her!

1353
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:52,125
Wait, I got it!

1354
01:14:52,208 --> 01:14:53,458
Remember when
you took all of those

1355
01:14:53,541 --> 01:14:56,000
pictures of us doing like,
club stuff, Sohara?

1356
01:14:56,083 --> 01:14:58,833
Yeah--the album's
right over here.

1357
01:15:05,625 --> 01:15:06,833
What the hell?

1358
01:15:06,916 --> 01:15:08,666
She's gone.

1359
01:15:10,708 --> 01:15:13,333
Something fishy's going on here!

1360
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:16,500
Uh, Tomo, where're you going?

1361
01:15:24,375 --> 01:15:25,666
I'm awake!

1362
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:26,666
No, please!

1363
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:28,291
Send me back into the dream!

1364
01:15:28,375 --> 01:15:29,375
I beg of you!

1365
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:32,041
You wanted your dream,
and you had it.

1366
01:15:32,125 --> 01:15:36,291
Mewling for do-overs after
the fact is just ungrateful.

1367
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:40,875
Your little charade
has come to a messy end.

1368
01:15:40,958 --> 01:15:43,333
You've been purged
from their memories.

1369
01:15:43,416 --> 01:15:45,708
You're nothing to them.

1370
01:15:53,833 --> 01:15:56,625
Well, it appears
you're not entirely

1371
01:15:56,708 --> 01:15:59,500
forgettable to one
of those insects.

1372
01:16:03,375 --> 01:16:05,166
Tomoki, of course.

1373
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,166
You can see him again, you know.

1374
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:13,625
So long as you don't mind
making certain sacrifices.

1375
01:16:21,083 --> 01:16:23,791
Hiyori, where are you?

1376
01:16:38,875 --> 01:16:40,583
Damn it all, Hiyori!

1377
01:16:40,666 --> 01:16:44,250
Where did you go?

1378
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:02,250
Look at you.

1379
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:04,916
You knew.

1380
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,166
You knew that she was real.

1381
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:08,958
Master, we thought that--

1382
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:10,791
No-- you can't!

1383
01:17:11,208 --> 01:17:14,583
Tell the truth right now!

1384
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:16,791
She wanted to
tell you the truth!

1385
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:18,375
Don't blame her--blame me!

1386
01:17:18,458 --> 01:17:21,666
It's just once a human learns
the truth about this stuff,

1387
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:24,041
their mind can't
be wiped anymore!

1388
01:17:24,125 --> 01:17:26,958
That's why you were
never supposed to find out!

1389
01:17:27,041 --> 01:17:27,958
About what?

1390
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:29,208
Just say it!

1391
01:17:29,291 --> 01:17:31,833
Hiyori never really
did exist in this world,

1392
01:17:31,916 --> 01:17:34,666
but she's not the only one!

1393
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:40,041
--Tomoki!
--Master!

1394
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:50,125
How is it possible Master's
memories were not erased?

1395
01:17:50,208 --> 01:17:51,416
I don't know.

1396
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,416
But the longer he retains
them, the worse off

1397
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:55,708
he's going to be
in the long run.

1398
01:17:55,791 --> 01:17:56,958
What's that even mean?

1399
01:17:57,041 --> 01:17:59,291
Tomoki remembers all
the stuff about Hiyori

1400
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:01,541
that the Synapse took
from everyone else.

1401
01:18:01,625 --> 01:18:04,958
After a while, the strain of
it's gonna break him down.

1402
01:18:05,625 --> 01:18:07,791
It's "when," not "if".

1403
01:18:07,875 --> 01:18:10,708
How come a dummy
like him can't forget?

1404
01:18:12,041 --> 01:18:14,000
I forget all the time.

1405
01:18:14,083 --> 01:18:17,500
There must be
something we can do.

1406
01:18:20,125 --> 01:18:21,791
What the--?

1407
01:18:24,583 --> 01:18:25,750
What did you pick up?

1408
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:29,250
I dunno, but whatever
it is, it can't be good!

1409
01:18:40,458 --> 01:18:42,000
You're kidding me!

1410
01:19:02,041 --> 01:19:03,500
Oh, thank goodness.

1411
01:19:03,583 --> 01:19:06,458
I made it back
to my beloved home.

1412
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:09,750
Sorami City!

1413
01:19:12,375 --> 01:19:14,208
It's Hiyori.

1414
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,083
Hiyori!

1415
01:19:36,416 --> 01:19:40,958
She's become an Angeloid?

1416
01:19:43,833 --> 01:19:46,625
Engaging: Kairos.

1417
01:19:49,166 --> 01:19:50,708
Oh, no!

1418
01:19:50,791 --> 01:19:51,958
You monster!

1419
01:19:52,041 --> 01:19:54,958
How could you bring
her back as an Angeloid?

1420
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:57,291
Are you insane?

1421
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:59,291
Why should you care either way?

1422
01:19:59,375 --> 01:20:02,875
She was a Synapsian, but she
turned her back on the glory of

1423
01:20:02,958 --> 01:20:04,916
this world in
favor of that insect

1424
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,083
and that grimy little dung-heap.

1425
01:20:07,166 --> 01:20:12,541
So I sent her back, as the
destroyer of all she holds dear.

1426
01:20:12,916 --> 01:20:14,750
I've returned, Tomoki.

1427
01:20:14,833 --> 01:20:16,666
What are you waiting for, Zeta?

1428
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:20,166
It's time to make
your wish come true!

1429
01:20:21,208 --> 01:20:21,833
Hiyori!

1430
01:20:21,916 --> 01:20:22,583
Stop!

1431
01:20:22,666 --> 01:20:23,375
Hiyori!

1432
01:20:23,458 --> 01:20:25,125
Crap-cakes!

1433
01:20:27,166 --> 01:20:28,916
Hey, Ikaros?

1434
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:55,791
Stop attacking us, Hiyori!

1435
01:20:55,875 --> 01:20:56,958
We're your friends!

1436
01:20:57,041 --> 01:20:59,791
The lights are on,
but Hiyori ain't home!

1437
01:20:59,875 --> 01:21:01,958
Nicely done, Zeta!

1438
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:04,875
Now annihilate every
human you can find!

1439
01:21:04,958 --> 01:21:08,500
Where are you
hiding, Tomoki dear?

1440
01:21:20,666 --> 01:21:22,625
We have to stop her, and quick!

1441
01:21:22,708 --> 01:21:25,208
The direction she's going'll
take her straight into town!

1442
01:21:25,291 --> 01:21:26,458
We asked nice!

1443
01:21:26,541 --> 01:21:27,750
So what's plan B?

1444
01:21:27,833 --> 01:21:30,958
We'll have to take Hiyori out.

1445
01:21:31,833 --> 01:21:35,291
A master's orders are absolute--
we know that better than anyone!

1446
01:21:35,375 --> 01:21:38,291
If we let her go, she's won't
stop 'til she kills Tomoki!

1447
01:21:38,375 --> 01:21:39,416
Yeah, but--!

1448
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,875
Don't worry, Astraea.

1449
01:21:40,958 --> 01:21:41,958
I'll do it.

1450
01:21:42,041 --> 01:21:44,250
She's not sporting
any serious armor.

1451
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:47,958
One blast of my Paradise
Song should be enough!

1452
01:21:48,791 --> 01:21:50,500
I'm sorry.

1453
01:21:50,583 --> 01:21:51,625
No--you mustn't!

1454
01:21:51,708 --> 01:21:53,000
What the hell?

1455
01:21:53,083 --> 01:21:56,083
If I let you destroy Hiyori,
it will sadden Master!

1456
01:21:58,250 --> 01:22:00,833
Tomoki has no idea what
we're up against, Alpha!

1457
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:03,125
If we act now,
no one else gets hurt!

1458
01:22:03,208 --> 01:22:04,083
I'm not sure.

1459
01:22:04,166 --> 01:22:06,125
Why'd they make me so stupid?

1460
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:08,458
It's like "one plus one"
all over again!

1461
01:22:08,541 --> 01:22:09,833
Move.

1462
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:16,958
I have to do this.

1463
01:22:21,291 --> 01:22:22,291
Take her out.

1464
01:22:22,375 --> 01:22:25,375
One shout and it's done.

1465
01:22:26,166 --> 01:22:28,291
Quick and painless!

1466
01:22:31,458 --> 01:22:33,041
Don't do it, Nymph.

1467
01:22:33,125 --> 01:22:35,333
The one you're
gonna hurt is you.

1468
01:22:36,833 --> 01:22:39,083
I can't do it.

1469
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:43,708
Hiyori!

1470
01:22:43,791 --> 01:22:45,916
I swear I'm gonna help you!

1471
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,375
Damn you, Tomoki Sakurai!

1472
01:22:48,458 --> 01:22:50,083
What are you waiting for, Zeta?

1473
01:22:50,166 --> 01:22:52,000
Destroy him!

1474
01:22:52,333 --> 01:22:53,791
Aegis-L!

1475
01:22:56,583 --> 01:22:57,500
Tomoki!
Over here!

1476
01:22:57,583 --> 01:22:59,000
Sugata?

1477
01:23:00,166 --> 01:23:02,083
Keep her busy long as you can!

1478
01:23:02,166 --> 01:23:03,125
Ikaros!

1479
01:23:03,208 --> 01:23:04,625
What happens
if we attack all that

1480
01:23:04,708 --> 01:23:06,791
mechanical junk
floating behind her?

1481
01:23:07,333 --> 01:23:09,500
I mean, if we can
bust up all that crap,

1482
01:23:09,583 --> 01:23:11,541
do you think Hiyori'll
go back to normal?

1483
01:23:11,625 --> 01:23:14,083
I don't know,
but it's worth a try.

1484
01:23:14,166 --> 01:23:16,166
I'll hack her system
to immobilize her.

1485
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:19,125
While I'm doing that, I need you
two to destroy that machinery!

1486
01:23:19,208 --> 01:23:20,208
Okay?

1487
01:23:20,291 --> 01:23:21,625
Go!

1488
01:23:31,583 --> 01:23:33,708
All right!
Now!

1489
01:23:35,041 --> 01:23:36,583
Hack initiated!

1490
01:23:37,625 --> 01:23:39,041
Nymph!
What's wrong?

1491
01:23:39,125 --> 01:23:41,333
Hiyori executed a counter-hack!

1492
01:23:41,875 --> 01:23:44,791
You rejects are so
easy to outsmart.

1493
01:23:44,875 --> 01:23:47,125
I equipped this one with
top-notch electronics

1494
01:23:47,208 --> 01:23:49,458
for just such an occasion.

1495
01:23:55,041 --> 01:23:56,583
Chrysaor!

1496
01:23:56,666 --> 01:23:58,625
You leave her alone!

1497
01:23:58,708 --> 01:24:00,125
Kairos.

1498
01:24:04,208 --> 01:24:05,916
I just got rewound!

1499
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:08,583
Kairos.

1500
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:16,291
Nymph!

1501
01:24:16,375 --> 01:24:20,250
So, you like to get cute with
time-manipulation, do ya?

1502
01:24:21,291 --> 01:24:24,541
Hacking field, maximum range!

1503
01:24:27,125 --> 01:24:28,291
Now, Delta!

1504
01:24:28,375 --> 01:24:30,416
Try rushing her again--
and this time, floor it!

1505
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:31,500
Okay!

1506
01:24:31,583 --> 01:24:32,875
Alpha!
Fire!

1507
01:24:32,958 --> 01:24:34,583
If I must!

1508
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,583
Take that stuff!

1509
01:24:53,875 --> 01:24:55,541
Oh, no.

1510
01:24:56,541 --> 01:24:57,833
It's no use!

1511
01:24:57,916 --> 01:25:00,583
She's an Angeloid now,
and there's no undoing that!

1512
01:25:00,666 --> 01:25:03,875
She chose this fate, forsaking
her very nature for the chance

1513
01:25:03,958 --> 01:25:08,166
to see Tomoki Sakurai again--
and now she'll kill him!

1514
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:10,000
My master!

1515
01:25:10,958 --> 01:25:12,875
That sound.
It can't be!

1516
01:25:12,958 --> 01:25:14,833
That's her countdown timer!

1517
01:25:15,166 --> 01:25:18,000
If you tamper with time and
space too much all at once,

1518
01:25:18,083 --> 01:25:22,291
the temporal-spatio paradox
releases a massive energy burst!

1519
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:23,750
That's smart-people talk for

1520
01:25:23,833 --> 01:25:25,666
"She's gonna blow
up the town," huh?

1521
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:27,041
It is!

1522
01:25:27,125 --> 01:25:28,958
There's gotta be something
you can do to stop her!

1523
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:31,416
Can't you just break
off the ticking part?

1524
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:34,000
Maybe I can bypass her
command to self-destruct.

1525
01:25:34,083 --> 01:25:35,083
But if I fail--

1526
01:25:35,166 --> 01:25:36,583
Then what'll happen?

1527
01:25:36,666 --> 01:25:40,500
Hiyori and everything around
her will be annihilated.

1528
01:25:40,583 --> 01:25:43,375
I know I have to do it,
but it's not the bad ones'

1529
01:25:43,458 --> 01:25:45,333
fault they didn't work out.

1530
01:25:45,416 --> 01:25:48,291
Extend Aegis around
myself and Hiyori!

1531
01:25:48,375 --> 01:25:49,541
Of course!

1532
01:25:49,625 --> 01:25:51,125
Aegis is strong enough
to contain the blast!

1533
01:25:51,208 --> 01:25:53,375
The explosion won't
even reach Sorami!

1534
01:25:53,458 --> 01:25:55,375
Good thinking, Ikaros!

1535
01:25:58,833 --> 01:26:01,041
Huh?
How come she's inside it?

1536
01:26:01,125 --> 01:26:02,291
Get out of there, Alpha!

1537
01:26:02,375 --> 01:26:04,000
If she goes off while
you're both inside,

1538
01:26:04,083 --> 01:26:06,458
you'll be vaporized, too!

1539
01:26:06,541 --> 01:26:08,083
You and I are the same.

1540
01:26:08,166 --> 01:26:10,250
We were given powers
we never asked for,

1541
01:26:10,333 --> 01:26:12,375
and ordered to hurt people.

1542
01:26:13,166 --> 01:26:16,333
Our reactors ache
for the same person.

1543
01:26:17,291 --> 01:26:18,333
Hiyori.

1544
01:26:18,416 --> 01:26:20,541
So you understand
why I feel that way?

1545
01:26:20,625 --> 01:26:23,583
Sure, they're plants but I
betcha they have feelings, too!

1546
01:26:23,666 --> 01:26:26,458
Poor little watermelon,
all alone!

1547
01:26:28,541 --> 01:26:30,958
You do not have to be alone.

1548
01:26:31,833 --> 01:26:33,958
I will stay with you...

1549
01:26:34,416 --> 01:26:36,458
To the very end.

1550
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,250
Forgive me, Master.

1551
01:26:40,333 --> 01:26:42,791
I cannot let
Hiyori perish alone.

1552
01:26:42,875 --> 01:26:44,416
Ikaros!

1553
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,541
I ordered you not to die!

1554
01:26:46,625 --> 01:26:47,708
Tomoki?

1555
01:26:47,791 --> 01:26:49,666
Man, is he dumb!

1556
01:26:51,083 --> 01:26:52,583
Godspeed, Tomoki.

1557
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:54,958
It's all up to you now.

1558
01:26:59,708 --> 01:27:01,083
Master!

1559
01:27:06,208 --> 01:27:08,208
Aegis power mode!

1560
01:27:14,083 --> 01:27:15,458
Dummy.

1561
01:27:15,541 --> 01:27:17,791
Why the heck were you just
going to throw in the towel?

1562
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:20,166
I'm gonna save Hiyori
and the rest of us,

1563
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:21,916
so don't go wussing out.

1564
01:27:22,958 --> 01:27:24,291
Right.

1565
01:27:26,291 --> 01:27:29,375
Hiyori, I know Sorami's
been changing lately,

1566
01:27:29,458 --> 01:27:31,416
but don't let it bum you out.

1567
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:33,000
There.
You see?

1568
01:27:33,083 --> 01:27:34,583
That spot you love so much.

1569
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:36,458
That we both love so much.

1570
01:27:36,541 --> 01:27:38,416
It's just fine.

1571
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:41,500
Oh, right.
I forgot.

1572
01:27:42,375 --> 01:27:44,541
Here.
These belong to you.

1573
01:27:52,291 --> 01:27:54,125
They look good on you.

1574
01:27:54,208 --> 01:27:56,250
I've always thought so.

1575
01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:01,291
I--

1576
01:28:01,875 --> 01:28:03,333
I remember you.

1577
01:28:03,416 --> 01:28:05,125
Huh?

1578
01:28:05,208 --> 01:28:06,958
Tomoki.

1579
01:28:09,125 --> 01:28:10,500
Hiyori!

1580
01:28:11,666 --> 01:28:13,541
It's time for you to go.

1581
01:28:13,625 --> 01:28:15,875
If you stay any
longer the explosion

1582
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:18,000
is going to destroy you both!

1583
01:28:18,708 --> 01:28:20,750
I know you can hear me, Ikaros.

1584
01:28:20,833 --> 01:28:22,083
And you were right.

1585
01:28:22,166 --> 01:28:24,458
We are the same.

1586
01:28:24,541 --> 01:28:25,750
We don't want--

1587
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:27,875
--the boy we love to die.

1588
01:28:27,958 --> 01:28:29,666
I can't stop the process now.

1589
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:32,500
But there's one
final thing I can do!

1590
01:28:32,583 --> 01:28:35,291
Commencing program hack.

1591
01:28:43,041 --> 01:28:45,458
Lowering Aegis.

1592
01:28:45,541 --> 01:28:47,083
Master!

1593
01:28:47,875 --> 01:28:49,333
Tomoki.

1594
01:28:49,916 --> 01:28:51,375
Thank you.

1595
01:28:52,125 --> 01:28:55,541
I'm sure you've long since
forgotten but the reason

1596
01:28:55,625 --> 01:29:00,666
I came to love Sorami so
much was because of you.

1597
01:29:01,208 --> 01:29:03,291
Here...
I found these!

1598
01:29:04,416 --> 01:29:06,208
Thanks a lot.

1599
01:29:06,291 --> 01:29:09,333
Now that you've got 'em back,
you don't have to cry.

1600
01:29:09,416 --> 01:29:10,375
Hey, come here!

1601
01:29:10,458 --> 01:29:12,458
Wanna see something cool?

1602
01:29:14,041 --> 01:29:15,583
Heh.
It's neat, huh!

1603
01:29:15,666 --> 01:29:16,375
Yeah!

1604
01:29:16,458 --> 01:29:17,458
Isn't it pretty?

1605
01:29:17,541 --> 01:29:18,625
Uh-huh!

1606
01:29:19,791 --> 01:29:22,833
Those bells in
your hair look pretty, too.

1607
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,208
Hey, you wanna play with me?

1608
01:29:25,291 --> 01:29:28,125
It's way more fun than
being all alone, right?

1609
01:29:29,375 --> 01:29:30,583
Yeah!

1610
01:29:32,125 --> 01:29:35,708
At that moment, I decided
to live in your town forever.

1611
01:29:35,791 --> 01:29:39,000
To find my bliss
in an endless dream.

1612
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:41,333
We didn't have
much time together,

1613
01:29:41,416 --> 01:29:44,166
but getting to know all
of you, especially you,

1614
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:47,750
Tomoki, brought me
such happiness.

1615
01:29:48,125 --> 01:29:49,458
Hiyori!

1616
01:29:49,541 --> 01:29:51,541
Thank you for being my friends.

1617
01:29:51,625 --> 01:29:53,916
I had the time of my life.

1618
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,208
And Tomoki,
I really do love you.

1619
01:29:57,291 --> 01:30:00,041
Hiyori!
Don't go!

1620
01:30:22,416 --> 01:30:24,458
I swore to her, Ikaros.

1621
01:30:24,541 --> 01:30:28,166
I swore to Hiyori
that I was gonna save her!

1622
01:30:39,416 --> 01:30:41,125
And now she's gone!

1623
01:30:42,166 --> 01:30:45,791
I know that I'll
never forget her.

1624
01:30:48,125 --> 01:30:53,083
You were the first girl who
ever told me that she loves me.

1625
01:30:53,541 --> 01:30:56,000
Thank you, Hiyori.

1626
01:31:07,416 --> 01:31:12,375
