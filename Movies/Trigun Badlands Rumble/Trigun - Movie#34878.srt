01:28:46,458 --> 01:28:48,166
&gt;&gt; COME WITH ME.


1652
01:28:48,250 --> 01:28:50,750
I CAN OFFER YOU PROTECTION.


1653
01:28:50,833 --> 01:28:54,000
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, BUT I CAN'T GO
WITH A ROBBER.


1654
01:28:54,083 --> 01:28:56,583
I WILL ACCEPT THIS, THOUGH.


1655
01:28:56,666 --> 01:28:59,500
I SUPPOSE IF I RETURN IT, MY
CONNECTION TO YOU WILL BE CUT,


1656
01:28:59,583 --> 01:29:00,958
RIGHT?


1657
01:29:01,041 --> 01:29:04,208
AND THEN THE NEXT TIME WE MEET.


1658
01:29:10,041 --> 01:29:17,916
&gt;&gt; SHE BEAT ME.


1659
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,000
&gt;&gt; SAY, DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
THAT AMELIA WAS ONLY AROUND


1660
01:29:21,083 --> 01:29:22,458
19 YEARS OLD?


1661

&gt;&gt; YEAH.


1662
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:25,833
I HAD MY GUESS THAT SHE WAS IN
THAT AGE RANGE.


1663
01:29:25,916 --> 01:29:28,958
&gt;&gt; WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS THAT
IF YOU HADN'T SAVED GASBACK, SHE


1664
01:29:29,041 --> 01:29:30,375
NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN.


1665
01:29:30,458 --> 01:29:32,291
THAT'S ABOUT THE SHAPE OF IT.


1666
01:29:35,666 --> 01:29:37,500
&gt;&gt; MAKES SENSE.

GET A BAD ROLL OF THE DICE, EVEN


1668
01:29:47,333 --> 01:29:49,500
WHEN IT TURNS UP SNAKE EYES.


1669
01:29:49,583 --> 01:29:51,416
&gt;&gt; YEAH.


1670
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:02,291
&gt;&gt; WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
GOING?


1671
01:30:02,375 --> 01:30:05,125
THE TOWN WE'RE GOING TO IS THAT
WAY!
