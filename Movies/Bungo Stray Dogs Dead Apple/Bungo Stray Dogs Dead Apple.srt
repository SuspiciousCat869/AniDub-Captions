1
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,303
This is sickening.

2
00:01:04,637 --> 00:01:08,297
No matter which way you look,
you can't escape the carnage.

3
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:29,245
At least this little one survived.

4
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,651
You're one lucky kid.

5
00:01:31,465 --> 00:01:32,445
Odasaku.

6
00:01:32,565 --> 00:01:33,758
That you, Dazai?

7
00:01:33,783 --> 00:01:36,873
I know exactly what you're up to,
but you gotta get out of there.

8
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:38,900
It's gonna get a lot more dangerous.

9
00:01:40,326 --> 00:01:42,233
Can you piss off already?

10
00:01:44,025 --> 00:01:45,566
Why, it's Chuuya.

11
00:01:45,713 --> 00:01:48,290
Go get in the line of enemy, fire and die.

12
00:01:48,315 --> 00:01:49,170
Hey. Thanks.

13
00:01:49,223 --> 00:01:50,466
Shut yer mouth.

14
00:02:01,962 --> 00:02:03,875
Another gifted jackass.

15
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,094
This guy thinks he's hot shit.

16
00:02:27,845 --> 00:02:31,065
It would've been more fun if you'd
been fried to death by the lightning.

17
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:34,862
I've got an idea...

18
00:02:34,887 --> 00:02:36,062
...why don't zip it?

19
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:37,862
You're five minutes late, you know.

20
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,899
He was able to hit me more three
times while you kept me waiting.

21
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:46,637
Aw, poor baby.

22
00:02:46,662 --> 00:02:48,609
Want me to pick up where he left off?

23
00:02:48,662 --> 00:02:51,645
Save that energy for our approaching "guests."

24
00:02:55,997 --> 00:02:57,861
Look at all these scrubs.

25
00:02:57,961 --> 00:03:01,248
I'm assuming I can leave the cleaning detail to you then.

26
00:03:01,385 --> 00:03:02,025
Sure.

27
00:03:04,821 --> 00:03:05,475
Hmm...

28
00:03:05,721 --> 00:03:08,869
Now that I think about it.
I have a debt to repay you.

29
00:03:19,146 --> 00:03:20,766
It shall be mine.

30
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:23,366
It shall not be mine.

31
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:25,649
It shall be mine.

32
00:03:25,922 --> 00:03:27,636
It shall not be mine.

33
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,067
It shall be mine.

34
00:03:30,781 --> 00:03:32,587
It shall not be mine.

35
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:35,258
It shall be mine.

36
00:03:35,857 --> 00:03:37,711
It shall not be mine.

37
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:40,075
It shall be mine.

38
00:03:40,881 --> 00:03:42,987
It shall not be mine.

39
00:03:44,061 --> 00:03:45,159
It shall be mine.

40
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,710
Those jewels are all real.

41
00:03:46,824 --> 00:03:48,110
What a waste.

42
00:03:48,844 --> 00:03:51,576
He could have made a lady really happy.

43
00:03:52,183 --> 00:03:54,379
It shall not be mine.

44
00:03:59,203 --> 00:04:01,971
My predictions have once again come true.

45
00:04:01,996 --> 00:04:03,736
How dreadfully boring.

46
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,386
I've crafted an organization,

47
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,060
but still haven't obtained what I seek.

48
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,727
I want back the friends you killed.

49
00:04:14,243 --> 00:04:17,766
Salutations, undistinguished guest.

50
00:04:18,113 --> 00:04:23,623
Unfortunately, I don't expect you
will give me that which I desire either.

51
00:04:24,027 --> 00:04:26,367
It would be best for you to die,

52
00:04:26,394 --> 00:04:27,781
just as they did.

53
00:04:28,813 --> 00:04:32,203
Your terribly boring friends all killed themselves.

54
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:35,811
A boring end for like-minded simpletons.

55
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:38,284
Bastard...

56
00:04:43,888 --> 00:04:45,863
Don't stop me, Dazai.

57
00:04:45,888 --> 00:04:47,179
Good grief.

58
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:49,916
You're using your corrupted form?

59
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,186
Fine.

60
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,390
This is too much fun.

61
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:08,100
I never knew Yokohama had a place like this.

62
00:09:10,768 --> 00:09:11,528
Huh?

63
00:09:20,849 --> 00:09:22,466
Question for you, Atsushi.

64
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,398
Yeah?

65
00:09:23,638 --> 00:09:26,338
Do you happen to know whose grave this is?

66
00:09:26,392 --> 00:09:27,345
I don't.

67
00:09:27,738 --> 00:09:31,378
But whoever the person was,
they were important to you, Dazai.

68
00:09:34,315 --> 00:09:35,475
How do you figure?

69
00:09:35,628 --> 00:09:39,548
I've never even heard of you wanting
to visit someone's grave site before.

70
00:09:39,948 --> 00:09:43,098
Do I really look like someone
who's visiting a grave to you?

71
00:09:43,838 --> 00:09:45,346
Uh, yeah, you do.

72
00:09:45,371 --> 00:09:45,758
Huh?

73
00:09:56,203 --> 00:09:57,711
Odasaku!

74
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,327
Odasaku...

75
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,747
...tell me what I should do.

76
00:10:10,685 --> 00:10:13,132
Be someone that protects people.

77
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:18,669
If both sides are the same to you, then become a good man.

78
00:10:19,002 --> 00:10:22,539
Protect the vulnerable, help out some orphans.

79
00:10:23,006 --> 00:10:27,206
I know that the concept of good
and evil doesn't mean much to you.

80
00:10:27,773 --> 00:10:28,880
But at least...

81
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,443
...it would make your
world a little more beautiful.

82
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,003
You can't know that.

83
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,997
Of course I can.

84
00:10:36,397 --> 00:10:38,062
I'm certain of it.

85
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:40,089
Because...

86
00:10:41,422 --> 00:10:44,297
...I know my friend better than anyone.

87
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,247
Was this person someone you had been in love with?

88
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,705
If it had been a woman,

89
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:56,510
I would have died with her.

90
00:10:56,717 --> 00:10:58,964
Oh yeah. How could I forget about that...

91
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,077
You say something?

92
00:11:00,102 --> 00:11:01,327
N-No! Nothing...

93
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,509
He was my friend.

94
00:11:03,822 --> 00:11:08,509
The man who gave me a reason to quit the
Port Mafia and join the Detective Agency.

95
00:11:10,402 --> 00:11:13,949
If it weren't for him, I would
probably still be working with them,

96
00:11:14,582 --> 00:11:16,922
murdering people without a pang of guilt.

97
00:11:16,947 --> 00:11:17,762
Huh?

98
00:11:18,615 --> 00:11:19,902
I'm just kidding.

99
00:11:20,705 --> 00:11:24,175
I'm guessing Kunikida ordered
you to come find me, didn't he?

100
00:11:25,115 --> 00:11:26,335
Uh... Yeah.

101
00:11:26,415 --> 00:11:28,386
He wants you to come to a big meeting.

102
00:11:28,566 --> 00:11:29,789
I'll pass.

103
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:30,902
Why?

104
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:34,162
There's a new method of suicide I wanted to test out.

105
00:11:34,872 --> 00:11:36,544
I should have guessed.

106
00:11:37,398 --> 00:11:38,364
Maaan...

107
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:41,178
Kunikida's not gonna
be happy about this.

108
00:11:44,782 --> 00:11:48,772
This is footage from a security
camera located in Taipei, Taiwan.

109
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:52,686
The city was engulfed in fog within a matter of minutes,

110
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:54,719
that subsided soon after.

111
00:11:55,401 --> 00:11:58,364
But this event was more than just a weather anomaly.

112
00:12:00,547 --> 00:12:04,316
A burnt corpse was discovered after the fog lifted.

113
00:12:06,082 --> 00:12:07,268
Here's a closeup.

114
00:12:08,585 --> 00:12:10,039
That's horrible.

115
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:11,912
Kunikida...

116
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,939
Yes?

117
00:12:14,705 --> 00:12:16,538
That person was gifted, yeah?

118
00:12:16,621 --> 00:12:18,621
You're correct as always, Rampo.

119
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:22,915
This individual was well known locally as a fire-wielder.

120
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:26,538
This is Singapore, a year ago.

121
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,865
The fog was sighted here as well.

122
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:31,905
And similarly, another body was discovered.

123
00:12:33,997 --> 00:12:38,216
He was a card-wielding gifted
and highly skilled assassin.

124
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:42,541
This scene took place in Detroit, six months ago.

125
00:12:43,134 --> 00:12:45,598
Another body discovered after the fog.

126
00:12:47,157 --> 00:12:49,264
As you can no doubt guess by now,

127
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,617
she was an ice-wielding gifted.

128
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,705
It seems in all instances where this fog appeared,

129
00:12:55,788 --> 00:12:59,214
the gifted died as a
result of their own abilities.

130
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,062
We're still gathering info.

131
00:13:01,536 --> 00:13:04,476
Do you think these deaths are
connected to the fog somehow?

132
00:13:05,496 --> 00:13:07,654
It's a bit much to be a coincidence.

133
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,959
There are currently 128 similar cases,

134
00:13:11,038 --> 00:13:13,969
and the resulting death toll has surpassed 500.

135
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:18,913
The Special Operations Division has a name for this event.

136
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,251
They're calling it the "Serial Gifted Suicide Outbreak."

137
00:13:22,971 --> 00:13:26,296
Since we're on the subject, where is Dazai anyway?

138
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:32,346
He said he wanted to try out a new
method of suicide, so he had to pass.

139
00:13:32,371 --> 00:13:33,543
Whaaat?!

140
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:35,996
I'm gonna ring his scrawny neck!

141
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,273
Interesting...

142
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,246
What are you doing, Rampo?

143
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,364
You're acting weird.

144
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:50,321
That's my little secret.

145
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:53,221
This fog makes me nervous.

146
00:13:53,246 --> 00:13:56,090
Apparently any gifted who it touches kills themselves.

147
00:13:56,115 --> 00:13:58,445
Don't worry, I'd never let you do that!

148
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,997
I'm not gonna let you leave
your poor, sweet sister...

149
00:14:01,035 --> 00:14:04,835
So you didn't bring all of
us in just to talk about this...

150
00:14:05,062 --> 00:14:08,276
Obviously we all have powers,
and we need to be on our guard.

151
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,163
But I'm assuming there's more to it.

152
00:14:10,322 --> 00:14:12,762
We've been asked to investigate the matter.

153
00:14:13,182 --> 00:14:18,951
We received information that a man thought to be
involved in these serial suicides is here in Yokohama.

154
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,581
Our orders are to capture him alive.

155
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:23,935
This is our suspect.

156
00:14:29,832 --> 00:14:33,325
Tatsuhiko Shibusawa.
Twenty-nine years of age.

157
00:14:33,596 --> 00:14:39,016
The only information we have so far is that
he's gifted and is known as "the Collector."

158
00:14:39,621 --> 00:14:40,445
Is something wrong?

159
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,136
Huh?

160
00:14:42,503 --> 00:14:44,163
No, it's nothing.

161
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:48,679
This is a case worthy of our agency.

162
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,687
Our fellow gifted
are directly in danger.

163
00:14:51,859 --> 00:14:55,473
It is also important to protect
the lives of those of us here.

164
00:14:55,647 --> 00:14:57,824
And as servants to the people,

165
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:01,577
I fear that the broader public
will soon be at grave risk.

166
00:15:03,157 --> 00:15:06,163
As of this moment, I hereby declare.

167
00:15:06,246 --> 00:15:08,282
This mission is in full effect.

168
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:17,468
Mr. Kunikida.

169
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:19,397
Can I ask you something?

170
00:15:19,471 --> 00:15:20,264
What is it?

171
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:24,503
Do think somebody could make people commit serial suicide?

172
00:15:24,794 --> 00:15:25,814
Hard to say.

173
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:29,658
If a person had the ability to
control others psychologically,

174
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:34,768
the international investigation agencies would
surely have information on someone that powerful.

175
00:15:36,991 --> 00:15:42,559
Well, hopefully, the agent we're meeting with
will be able to give us some useful information.

176
00:15:45,973 --> 00:15:46,682
Hmmm...

177
00:15:46,748 --> 00:15:48,682
We are right on schedule.

178
00:15:49,142 --> 00:15:50,045
Kunikida!

179
00:15:50,219 --> 00:15:50,692
Hmm?

180
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:05,133
I think our meeting's been canceled.

181
00:16:05,433 --> 00:16:06,446
He's dead.

182
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,427
Hmm?

183
00:16:10,455 --> 00:16:11,723
Did you find something?

184
00:16:12,056 --> 00:16:14,136
I think the murderer left this...

185
00:16:14,523 --> 00:16:15,570
An apple?

186
00:16:17,513 --> 00:16:19,753
Kunikida, I don't get it.

187
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:21,967
Why an apple?

188
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:25,217
I have no idea.

189
00:16:51,538 --> 00:16:53,573
What shall we toast to this evening?

190
00:16:55,371 --> 00:16:57,725
Shouldn't we wait for Ango to join us?

191
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,190
Let's just chat till he gets here then.

192
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,580
I've heard some interesting stories lately.

193
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,907
What do you know about apple suicide?

194
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,587
Apple suicide?

195
00:17:10,788 --> 00:17:13,010
Yup, you heard me right.

196
00:17:13,137 --> 00:17:16,031
Ohh, like from Cinderella.

197
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,610
Cinderella...

198
00:17:19,884 --> 00:17:20,771
Hmm...

199
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:24,836
I have to admit that was a completely unexpected answer.

200
00:17:26,023 --> 00:17:28,971
Talking with you is never boring, Odasaku.

201
00:17:29,663 --> 00:17:30,872
Just for the record,

202
00:17:30,955 --> 00:17:35,945
it was Snow White who ate the poisoned
apple, and it wasn't suicide in her case.

203
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:36,984
I see.

204
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:38,584
I got it wrong then.

205
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:44,148
Come to think of it, maybe Snow White
really did commit suicide after all.

206
00:17:44,534 --> 00:17:48,343
What if she took a bite of the
apple knowing it was poisoned?

207
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:49,246
Why though?

208
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:50,815
Despair perhaps?

209
00:17:51,246 --> 00:17:53,930
Think of all the abuse
she'd already endured.

210
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:58,610
Or maybe it was something simpler.

211
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:02,100
A deep depression that's intrinsic to this world.

212
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,087
Wouldn't that'd be an interesting twist?

213
00:18:06,514 --> 00:18:10,064
I brought this up, because I met
a unique gifted the other day.

214
00:18:11,538 --> 00:18:14,285
He can make people commit apple suicide.

215
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:18,438
Maybe it'll take off here in Yokohama someday.

216
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:19,589
Suicide?

217
00:18:20,247 --> 00:18:21,015
Yeah.

218
00:18:22,073 --> 00:18:23,860
Wouldn't it be beautiful?

219
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,783
Hmm... You sure are interesting.

220
00:18:30,063 --> 00:18:32,080
Your mind is always dancing.

221
00:18:33,392 --> 00:18:35,822
To me, you're the fascinating one.

222
00:18:39,144 --> 00:18:40,984
Ango's really late.

223
00:18:41,564 --> 00:18:43,291
He won't be coming tonight.

224
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:47,814
Odasaku...

225
00:18:48,464 --> 00:18:50,188
What you said is true.

226
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:54,371
Fighting to save people is definitely more beautiful...

227
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:59,041
If the goal is to keep living.

228
00:19:04,413 --> 00:19:07,320
I'm taking off now, Odasaku.

229
00:19:17,453 --> 00:19:18,687
Hello, Dazai.

230
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,560
What a surprise to see you, Ango.

231
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,510
Did you come for a drink?

232
00:19:24,116 --> 00:19:26,803
Not tonight. I'm here on business.

233
00:19:27,096 --> 00:19:28,286
Business?

234
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:34,864
You're responsible for bringing
Tatsuhiko Shibusawa to Yokohama, aren't you?

235
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:42,087
Tell me, Dazai. Are you planning
to start a mass suicide in this city?

236
00:19:43,323 --> 00:19:46,466
Do you think you would actually
be able catch me if I did?

237
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,506
Get out, you good-for-nothing!

238
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:56,770
No orphanage wants someone like you!

239
00:19:58,686 --> 00:20:02,442
The world would be a better place if
you'd just die in a ditch somewhere!

240
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:03,559
What is this?

241
00:20:03,927 --> 00:20:05,081
You are not capable...

242
00:20:16,156 --> 00:20:17,509
Just a dream...

243
00:20:18,163 --> 00:20:18,996
...right?

244
00:20:19,663 --> 00:20:20,663
Can I come in?

245
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:23,366
Uh, yeah...

246
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:27,126
Are you all right?

247
00:20:27,786 --> 00:20:29,489
Yeah... Why?

248
00:20:30,122 --> 00:20:32,035
I heard you cry out in your sleep.

249
00:20:32,129 --> 00:20:33,142
Hm...

250
00:20:33,363 --> 00:20:35,496
I was having a nightmare.

251
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,432
Wait, what are you doing?!

252
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:41,240
Did there happen to be fog in your dream?

253
00:20:41,265 --> 00:20:41,848
Huh?

254
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:49,556
Is this...

255
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,752
I'm not getting reception.

256
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:00,783
Me neither.

257
00:21:00,996 --> 00:21:05,598
Do you think this is the same fog
that makes gifted kill themselves?

258
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,555
Let's go to the Agency.

259
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,293
Huh??

260
00:21:10,253 --> 00:21:11,160
Right now??

261
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,643
Maybe we should wait for the fog to clear up!

262
00:21:40,253 --> 00:21:42,873
Um... K... Kyouka...?

263
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:45,453
Hey, wait!

264
00:21:49,157 --> 00:21:50,563
Is the driver okay?

265
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,350
Huh?

266
00:21:52,807 --> 00:21:53,993
What's going on?

267
00:21:56,573 --> 00:21:58,567
Hey... Look over there.

268
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:24,653
There was only silence.

269
00:22:25,955 --> 00:22:30,057
It was as if every person in the
city had suddenly been spirited away.

270
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,420
Get out, you good-for-nothing!

271
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:44,452
No matter how long you search, you'll
never find a place where you belong!

272
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,767
Hey, Kyouka?

273
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:49,667
There's a blood lust in the air.

274
00:22:50,553 --> 00:22:51,636
Hang on!

275
00:23:03,862 --> 00:23:06,008
Another suicide by a gifted?

276
00:23:06,088 --> 00:23:07,882
I don't see a body anywhere.

277
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:24,747
Kyouka... let's go!

278
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,821
Beast Beneath the Moonlight!

279
00:23:26,846 --> 00:23:29,286
Demon Snow, defeat my enemy!

280
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:50,463
Kunikida?!

281
00:23:51,562 --> 00:23:52,509
Atsushi.

282
00:23:52,582 --> 00:23:53,542
You're hurt!

283
00:23:53,663 --> 00:23:54,776
Did you get shot?

284
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:56,688
I got the bullet out.

285
00:23:56,829 --> 00:23:57,926
I'll be fine.

286
00:23:58,413 --> 00:24:01,366
More importantly, I know what's causing these suicides.

287
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,687
Run for it!

288
00:24:22,812 --> 00:24:23,945
Kunikida, hurry!

289
00:24:29,737 --> 00:24:30,784
Just hang in there!

290
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,430
Kyouka?

291
00:24:34,413 --> 00:24:35,497
Are you all right?

292
00:24:36,329 --> 00:24:37,907
Tell us who did this to you!

293
00:24:38,967 --> 00:24:40,830
I got shot by my own ability.

294
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:44,531
That doesn't make any sense!

295
00:24:51,204 --> 00:24:52,399
That's Demon Snow!

296
00:24:54,624 --> 00:24:55,370
Get in!

297
00:24:55,414 --> 00:24:56,651
Move your ass, kid!

298
00:25:13,703 --> 00:25:18,380
Mr. Kunikida, what were you about to
tell us about these serial suicides?

299
00:25:19,346 --> 00:25:21,917
None of the gifted ever committed suicide.

300
00:25:22,497 --> 00:25:25,010
They were killed at the hands of their own abilities.

301
00:25:26,963 --> 00:25:29,580
We need to hurry back to the Agency.

302
00:25:35,395 --> 00:25:36,795
What happened here?

303
00:25:37,585 --> 00:25:39,211
To the President's office!

304
00:25:49,455 --> 00:25:50,745
What are you doing?!

305
00:26:10,482 --> 00:26:12,216
What's that, sir?

306
00:26:20,841 --> 00:26:21,968
It's coming through.

307
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,631
Try and maintain this connection.

308
00:26:25,571 --> 00:26:28,725
Can you hear me? Is this President Fukuzawa?

309
00:26:28,958 --> 00:26:30,710
This is Doppo Kunikida.

310
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,923
You're with the Gifted Special
Operations Division, correct?

311
00:26:33,955 --> 00:26:35,637
Special Operations?

312
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:36,817
That's right.

313
00:26:37,153 --> 00:26:39,400
My name is Ango Sakaguchi.

314
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:43,186
Kunikida, what's the
current situation there?

315
00:26:43,486 --> 00:26:47,753
I'm here with Agency members
Atsushi Nakajima and Kyouka Izumi.

316
00:26:48,086 --> 00:26:50,806
The rest of our staff is currently unaccounted for.

317
00:26:51,052 --> 00:26:52,028
Understood.

318
00:26:52,228 --> 00:26:55,048
Our connection is unstable,
so I'll be brief.

319
00:26:55,722 --> 00:26:59,354
The Gifted Suicide Outbreak is now infecting Yokohama.

320
00:27:00,507 --> 00:27:04,334
The scope of it rivals anything
that we've seen before.

321
00:27:05,413 --> 00:27:10,991
Although the fog has currently stopped spreading,
the entirety of the city has been enveloped.

322
00:27:12,014 --> 00:27:14,994
Yokohama is currently cut off from the outside.

323
00:27:15,154 --> 00:27:17,468
Almost everyone in it has vanished.

324
00:27:17,694 --> 00:27:19,744
Only some of
the gifted still remain.

325
00:27:20,331 --> 00:27:24,307
But the fact is all of you there are in grave danger.

326
00:27:24,407 --> 00:27:26,274
That may be an understatement.

327
00:27:26,656 --> 00:27:29,637
Not only have the gifted lost the use of their abilities,

328
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,996
but they're being hunted down by them as well.

329
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,985
At this rate, we just might have a problem here.

330
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:16,884
Fortunately, we've determined the location of the
gifted who is likely responsible for this phenomenon.

331
00:28:19,914 --> 00:28:26,824
We were able to track him to this abandoned high-rise
in the center of Yokohama; a building called Mukurotoride.

332
00:28:27,496 --> 00:28:30,344
So then, is Shibusawa our man?

333
00:28:33,655 --> 00:28:37,095
Yes. He's the mastermind behind these events.

334
00:28:37,401 --> 00:28:43,204
Mr. Kunikida, by whatever means
necessary, you must eliminate him.

335
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,425
Also, I feel you should know.

336
00:28:47,913 --> 00:28:50,869
Dazai was last sighted in
the company of Shibusawa.

337
00:28:51,609 --> 00:28:53,049
Was he now...

338
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:55,162
So Dazai's been captured?!

339
00:28:55,389 --> 00:28:58,073
We need to act, before the city is destroyed.

340
00:28:58,246 --> 00:29:00,325
You're the only ones we can depend on!

341
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:14,504
He's here.

342
00:29:15,601 --> 00:29:17,108
You two go on ahead.

343
00:29:17,594 --> 00:29:19,134
I'll stop him myself.

344
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:24,496
Hang on a second, there's no way
you can win against your own ability.

345
00:29:24,725 --> 00:29:26,771
Winning or losing
doesn't matter.

346
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:29,830
What matters is the
will to keep fighting.

347
00:29:31,975 --> 00:29:36,051
Battling against one's self is nothing new to me.

348
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,568
What's all this?!

349
00:29:40,593 --> 00:29:42,933
We are the Armed Detective Agency.

350
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,023
Take this.

351
00:29:48,796 --> 00:29:50,790
I don't need one.

352
00:29:51,103 --> 00:29:54,753
My ability won't be able to recreate
a weapon larger than a notebook.

353
00:29:56,287 --> 00:29:59,330
You two escape out the back
while I draw his attention.

354
00:30:01,163 --> 00:30:02,243
Let's move out!

355
00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:07,474
Have we determined the location of Gifted Number A5158?

356
00:30:08,121 --> 00:30:08,849
Yes sir.

357
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:10,651
Send the following message.

358
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:11,923
Ready to transmit, sir.

359
00:30:12,856 --> 00:30:16,270
"It's time to pay your debt to Doc Glasses." End.

360
00:30:18,497 --> 00:30:19,757
Was that Kunikida?!

361
00:30:25,011 --> 00:30:28,064
I wonder if he's gonna be all right out there by himself.

362
00:30:28,105 --> 00:30:31,251
Our top priority is to find the person behind all this.

363
00:30:31,283 --> 00:30:33,341
And then we can focus
on eliminating him.

364
00:30:34,977 --> 00:30:36,864
Tatsuhiko Shibusawa...

365
00:30:38,257 --> 00:30:40,677
What kind of person are
we dealing with here?

366
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:47,367
I know we were ordered to take him out, but
are you sure we can't just capture him instead?

367
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:49,011
There's no need to kill him.

368
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:52,931
After we get Dazai out of there,
he can help us take him in alive.

369
00:30:53,678 --> 00:30:54,930
That's the plan.

370
00:30:54,955 --> 00:30:57,648
We just gotta make
our way over to him first.

371
00:30:57,821 --> 00:30:59,214
He'll know what to do.

372
00:31:30,647 --> 00:31:32,321
Tell me, Dazai.

373
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:37,038
That sight you're looking out on, isn't it boring?

374
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:38,444
You think so?

375
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:41,004
Yes. Incredibly.

376
00:31:41,612 --> 00:31:43,999
It's just a white sea
of nothingness.

377
00:31:44,327 --> 00:31:46,907
A formless, uninspired world.

378
00:31:47,187 --> 00:31:51,691
Tonight, all of Yokohama's
special abilities will become mine.

379
00:31:52,191 --> 00:31:57,948
No one whose intellect surpasses my own
or defies my expectations shall emerge.

380
00:31:58,371 --> 00:32:00,688
What a boring existence.

381
00:32:01,101 --> 00:32:04,965
You know, there was a time
when I felt the same way as you.

382
00:32:05,955 --> 00:32:07,678
How did you overcome it?

383
00:32:08,496 --> 00:32:12,180
Instead of trying to explain, how about I just show you?

384
00:32:22,615 --> 00:32:23,302
See?

385
00:32:23,621 --> 00:32:25,342
You can't read me, can you?

386
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:28,558
You don't know what my true intentions are.

387
00:32:30,121 --> 00:32:32,444
Am I really here to help you with your plan?

388
00:32:32,621 --> 00:32:34,984
Or am I using you for my own benefit?

389
00:32:35,824 --> 00:32:39,326
You're not as mysterious as you think, Dazai.

390
00:32:39,433 --> 00:32:42,450
Hey, you really do
need salvation, don't you?

391
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:47,083
And exactly who do you propose could save me?

392
00:32:47,792 --> 00:32:48,718
Who knows?

393
00:32:49,378 --> 00:32:51,098
An angel perhaps?

394
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:54,515
Or maybe a demon.

395
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:59,315
If you ask me, both of you are terrible liars.

396
00:32:59,428 --> 00:33:01,822
Your real intentions
are quite obvious.

397
00:33:02,142 --> 00:33:05,611
If this were a play, you
would've already lost your audience.

398
00:33:06,505 --> 00:33:07,198
Hmm.

399
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:09,485
The demon Fyodor arrives.

400
00:33:09,605 --> 00:33:14,054
As my collaborator, I'm going to have you dance as well.

401
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:15,422
Your collaborator?

402
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:19,892
You should rethink your relationship
since he'll probably betray you.

403
00:33:20,245 --> 00:33:22,825
I would agree wholeheartedly with that.

404
00:33:23,121 --> 00:33:27,549
Thus far, no one has been able
to surpass my expectations.

405
00:33:28,855 --> 00:33:30,837
Yet hope springs eternal.

406
00:33:30,862 --> 00:33:31,915
You know...

407
00:33:32,163 --> 00:33:36,588
I feel a little sorry for the
unfortunate gifted that reside in this city.

408
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:39,969
No matter which of us
three prevails in the end,

409
00:33:40,569 --> 00:33:42,436
their fate remains the same.

410
00:33:43,514 --> 00:33:45,394
All of them will perish.

411
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:51,509
If I never get my powers back,
what I am supposed to do then?

412
00:33:53,329 --> 00:33:57,103
Hey, don't you think you should be
driving slower in all of this fog?

413
00:33:57,329 --> 00:34:00,247
I have all of Yokohama's roads committed to memory.

414
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:05,209
It's a learned skill that's
not connected to my other abilities.

415
00:34:06,955 --> 00:34:10,899
When I first found out that I'd turned
into a tiger and gone on a rampage,

416
00:34:11,392 --> 00:34:14,839
I remember wishing that my ability would disappear.

417
00:34:15,035 --> 00:34:18,582
I never thought that one day
that tiger might turn and attack me.

418
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:21,415
Demon Snow was the one who murdered my parents.

419
00:34:21,488 --> 00:34:23,315
I've never thought of her as a friend.

420
00:34:23,468 --> 00:34:26,215
If she attacks me, I'll defeat her.

421
00:34:27,673 --> 00:34:28,515
She's here.

422
00:34:48,825 --> 00:34:50,079
The safety's on!

423
00:34:50,185 --> 00:34:50,779
Go!

424
00:34:50,972 --> 00:34:51,432
Huh?

425
00:34:51,663 --> 00:34:52,425
Hurry!

426
00:35:04,126 --> 00:35:05,313
I know you.

427
00:35:06,393 --> 00:35:07,433
Akutagawa!

428
00:35:09,269 --> 00:35:11,196
Such a pathetic weapon.

429
00:35:11,705 --> 00:35:15,290
Against him, you might as
well be brandishing a pea shooter.

430
00:35:43,163 --> 00:35:44,455
Interesting.

431
00:35:44,538 --> 00:35:46,699
I wonder who's gonna come out on top?

432
00:35:46,899 --> 00:35:48,853
We've got other things to worry about!

433
00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:54,655
There should be a secret path
nearby that the Mafia bosses use.

434
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,663
Move it, Weretiger.

435
00:35:57,747 --> 00:35:58,303
Wait!

436
00:35:58,397 --> 00:35:58,970
Go!

437
00:35:59,977 --> 00:36:01,277
I'll be right behind you!

438
00:36:03,447 --> 00:36:04,107
All right.

439
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:17,362
Kyouka!

440
00:36:28,179 --> 00:36:31,944
This emergency passage was made to
withstand an attack by the gifted.

441
00:36:32,244 --> 00:36:34,217
The fog won't reach us in here.

442
00:36:34,663 --> 00:36:37,073
What's making that fog so dangerous?

443
00:36:37,526 --> 00:36:39,339
It's the dragon's breath.

444
00:36:39,713 --> 00:36:40,633
The what?

445
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:45,592
Kyouka, since neither of us have our special abilities,

446
00:36:45,785 --> 00:36:48,075
you could easily kill me right here.

447
00:36:50,555 --> 00:36:51,396
What's wrong?

448
00:36:51,497 --> 00:36:55,574
If I'm not mistaken, you have a
score to settle with me, do you not?

449
00:36:55,687 --> 00:36:59,799
Look, she doesn't think about you guys
anymore, or any of that stuff from her past.

450
00:37:00,646 --> 00:37:03,488
Maybe you'd like to settle things here, Weretiger,

451
00:37:03,574 --> 00:37:05,203
while we're still powerless.

452
00:37:06,787 --> 00:37:09,651
Are you implying there's a way to get our abilities back?

453
00:37:10,024 --> 00:37:11,778
I may have some info on that.

454
00:37:11,831 --> 00:37:12,718
Like what?

455
00:37:12,851 --> 00:37:15,235
You'll regain your ability if you defeat it.

456
00:37:15,995 --> 00:37:18,548
Did you really not even figure that much out?

457
00:37:18,721 --> 00:37:20,828
What're you planning to do, Akutagawa?

458
00:37:21,258 --> 00:37:23,305
The same thing we are, probably.

459
00:37:23,518 --> 00:37:26,198
He's after... Shibusawa?

460
00:37:26,638 --> 00:37:29,508
When I get done with him, there won't be a shred left.

461
00:37:30,335 --> 00:37:32,948
It's the only way to save Yokohama.

462
00:37:33,428 --> 00:37:35,637
Kyouka and I won't kill anyone.

463
00:37:35,957 --> 00:37:38,965
That's not the way we do things in the Detective Agency.

464
00:37:39,277 --> 00:37:41,034
Is that a bad joke?

465
00:37:41,254 --> 00:37:42,867
You're too much, Weretiger.

466
00:37:42,941 --> 00:37:43,874
Why you...!

467
00:37:44,234 --> 00:37:47,146
Kyouka understands what needs to be done.

468
00:37:47,591 --> 00:37:50,306
Because she was part of the Port Mafia.

469
00:37:50,696 --> 00:37:53,082
I left that world to live in the light.

470
00:37:54,162 --> 00:37:57,568
I quit the Port Mafia to join the Detective Agency.

471
00:37:58,997 --> 00:38:02,288
They each take lives but kill
for very different reasons.

472
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:04,398
You alright, Kyouka.

473
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:07,958
Not killing Shibusawa may have been possible earlier,

474
00:38:08,225 --> 00:38:10,378
but not with Dazai on his side.

475
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:12,675
You're not saying Dazai's with him...

476
00:38:12,735 --> 00:38:13,775
I am.

477
00:38:14,588 --> 00:38:17,451
He joined forces with the enemy of his own volition.

478
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:20,131
I don't believe it, why would Dazai do that?!

479
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,483
He betrayed the Port Mafia.

480
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:23,810
That's what he does.

481
00:38:24,925 --> 00:38:28,052
Dazai's death will be at my hands.

482
00:38:29,145 --> 00:38:31,855
You don't actually think you can kill him, do you?

483
00:38:31,955 --> 00:38:34,015
If he's going to be a pawn for the enemy,

484
00:38:34,115 --> 00:38:35,689
I'd rather see him dead.

485
00:38:37,455 --> 00:38:39,872
No way I'm gonna let you kill Dazai.

486
00:38:50,409 --> 00:38:52,519
If that's the plan, you're on your own.

487
00:39:04,549 --> 00:39:05,809
I'm going with him.

488
00:39:06,476 --> 00:39:07,269
Huh??

489
00:39:22,716 --> 00:39:25,107
This is my collection room.

490
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,636
I welcome you to "Draconia."

491
00:39:37,691 --> 00:39:40,935
So these are all crystallized abilities.

492
00:39:41,581 --> 00:39:43,988
I'm impressed you gathered this many.

493
00:39:44,328 --> 00:39:45,955
A splendid collection.

494
00:39:46,088 --> 00:39:48,764
Even the devil himself would be envious.

495
00:39:48,818 --> 00:39:51,258
That would make you death's informant,

496
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:53,344
here as a rat for the devil.

497
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:56,615
After all, Fyodor.

498
00:39:56,997 --> 00:40:01,470
Most of this collection was gathered
using information I purchased from you.

499
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:08,434
Thanks to you, I was able to summon enough fog
so as to completely submerge this entire city.

500
00:40:10,246 --> 00:40:15,431
Just how were you able to acquire
such bountiful reservoirs of knowledge?

501
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:19,509
Every city has its rats, begging for a morsel of cheese.

502
00:40:19,534 --> 00:40:20,655
Meow.

503
00:40:22,908 --> 00:40:25,414
Another one has joined the collection.

504
00:40:26,268 --> 00:40:30,425
Somewhere in Yokohama, a gifted
has departed from this world.

505
00:40:31,832 --> 00:40:32,945
Alas...

506
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:38,171
until I possess the ability that is singularly valuable,

507
00:40:38,971 --> 00:40:41,517
this is all meaningless.

508
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:47,749
Kyouka...

509
00:40:48,376 --> 00:40:50,446
Why are you following this guy?

510
00:40:51,246 --> 00:40:53,326
He has information we need.

511
00:40:53,413 --> 00:40:56,259
He can navigate through this passage better than I can.

512
00:40:56,561 --> 00:41:01,041
And more importantly, once he's gotten
his ability back, he'll be a powerful asset.

513
00:41:01,081 --> 00:41:04,074
The three of us all have our sights set on Shibusawa.

514
00:41:04,894 --> 00:41:06,321
Even so...

515
00:41:07,525 --> 00:41:11,178
I see that you're still holding on
to your mother's cell phone, Kyouka.

516
00:41:11,411 --> 00:41:13,238
Some things never change.

517
00:41:15,218 --> 00:41:16,578
It was her mom's?

518
00:41:17,804 --> 00:41:20,007
Has she not even told you about that?

519
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,647
Not once.

520
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,755
What's the shortest route?

521
00:41:25,555 --> 00:41:27,628
Zero five zero five.

522
00:41:48,788 --> 00:41:52,652
It's impossible to lose something
that can sense your presence.

523
00:42:07,247 --> 00:42:08,181
I can help.

524
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,534
No.

525
00:42:11,464 --> 00:42:18,082
I've wandered many a night alone and slain countless
enemies in order to prove my superior strength.

526
00:42:18,542 --> 00:42:24,046
And now, an enemy who is worthy of my
attention is right here at my door step.

527
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,786
I will enjoy defeating it.

528
00:42:26,893 --> 00:42:28,866
He thinks he's a one-man army.

529
00:42:28,997 --> 00:42:31,493
We have our own battles to deal with right now.

530
00:42:40,204 --> 00:42:42,268
This is mine, go find yours.

531
00:42:46,788 --> 00:42:47,934
I can help you!

532
00:42:55,625 --> 00:43:01,533
I believe that humans are merely
predictable machines, housed in bodies of flesh.

533
00:43:02,251 --> 00:43:07,364
There is only one individual whose
nature continues to be elusive to me

534
00:43:07,817 --> 00:43:09,421
That is myself.

535
00:43:09,986 --> 00:43:11,993
Isn't that what friends are there for?

536
00:43:12,246 --> 00:43:14,630
What use would I have for such things?

537
00:43:14,655 --> 00:43:17,682
Everyone's mind is like an open book to me, after all.

538
00:43:18,256 --> 00:43:21,896
One day I will pass beyond this mundane world.

539
00:43:22,002 --> 00:43:24,249
Fall between the blank spaces,

540
00:43:24,662 --> 00:43:27,826
and see what's on the other side of the final page.

541
00:43:27,955 --> 00:43:32,276
If he thinks any of what he said makes
sense, he really could use some friends.

542
00:43:33,816 --> 00:43:36,449
The destined hour will arrive soon.

543
00:43:36,943 --> 00:43:42,173
All of the special abilities that
reside within Yokohama will belong to me.

544
00:43:47,077 --> 00:43:50,437
Unless there's someone who can surpass their own power.

545
00:43:51,223 --> 00:43:54,094
Do you think such a person exists?

546
00:44:03,845 --> 00:44:08,376
My ability turns cloth into a blade
and sends it flying at the enemy.

547
00:44:08,788 --> 00:44:11,749
But unless Rashoumon has you within its reach,

548
00:44:11,855 --> 00:44:13,742
it's powerless to attack.

549
00:44:29,371 --> 00:44:30,145
Dammit!

550
00:44:41,021 --> 00:44:43,301
How am I supposed to take that thing down?

551
00:44:43,801 --> 00:44:44,481
Huh?

552
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,877
Is that what I need to destroy?

553
00:44:55,371 --> 00:44:56,366
Dammit!

554
00:44:58,955 --> 00:45:02,905
Is it even possible for someone
to defeat their own special ability?

555
00:45:09,881 --> 00:45:11,721
Not good...

556
00:45:41,588 --> 00:45:43,481
Demon Snow killed my mother.

557
00:45:44,161 --> 00:45:48,598
But if I can somehow defeat her, she'll
become a part of me like she was before.

558
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:50,591
And I'll be a demon again.

559
00:46:46,801 --> 00:46:48,628
Exactly as I'd planned.

560
00:47:00,931 --> 00:47:04,231
I guess I should expect as much
from my own ability.

561
00:47:05,651 --> 00:47:06,384
Fine.

562
00:47:42,391 --> 00:47:44,185
That's where you belong.

563
00:47:44,238 --> 00:47:45,858
Don't run off again.

564
00:47:57,621 --> 00:48:00,309
"Demon Snow is slaughter made flesh."

565
00:48:01,288 --> 00:48:04,271
And yet... And yet...

566
00:48:05,573 --> 00:48:06,806
And yet, I...

567
00:48:26,163 --> 00:48:27,018
And yet...

568
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:33,264
Even now, you still wish to use that power to help others.

569
00:48:33,538 --> 00:48:34,991
Isn't that right, dear?

570
00:48:50,814 --> 00:48:51,887
Kyouka...

571
00:48:56,621 --> 00:48:57,553
Kyouka!

572
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,993
Shatter the crystal on her forehead!

573
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,589
Here it comes.

574
00:49:41,263 --> 00:49:42,063
What, sir?

575
00:49:42,805 --> 00:49:44,785
A5158.

576
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:53,639
You've got some nerve, ordering
me out here like some errand boy.

577
00:49:53,726 --> 00:49:55,166
This better be good.

578
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:58,670
Everyone, please give us a moment to talk alone.

579
00:50:00,309 --> 00:50:02,932
You do realize this is a government facility?

580
00:50:03,179 --> 00:50:05,725
There are consequences for assaulting our agents.

581
00:50:05,852 --> 00:50:08,870
I think you mistake me for someone who gives a damn.

582
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:10,658
I make my own rules.

583
00:50:10,683 --> 00:50:13,593
You have a debt to me that has yet to be resolved.

584
00:50:13,653 --> 00:50:15,480
You've got that ass-backwards.

585
00:50:15,539 --> 00:50:16,836
What are you talking about?

586
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:18,503
Don't play dumb with me.

587
00:50:18,541 --> 00:50:21,740
Do you really think I don't know
what happened six years ago?

588
00:50:21,955 --> 00:50:23,508
Of course, I know.

589
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:29,333
How's your wound?

590
00:50:29,873 --> 00:50:31,226
It'll be fine.

591
00:50:31,566 --> 00:50:35,770
Once I get him back, the tiger has
abilities that will help me to heal.

592
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,126
That's Mukurotoride.

593
00:50:48,288 --> 00:50:49,530
Dazai's in there.

594
00:50:50,503 --> 00:50:52,110
We have to rescue him.

595
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:53,863
I'm sure he'll know what to do.

596
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:22,788
You got your ability back, huh?

597
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:27,921
It doesn't seem like my tiger's abilities have returned.

598
00:51:28,255 --> 00:51:30,972
I thought that would happen once I defeated him.

599
00:51:32,955 --> 00:51:33,739
Huh?

600
00:51:42,663 --> 00:51:44,914
I'm guessing you got your powers back too.

601
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:47,827
Why haven't mine come back yet?

602
00:51:48,067 --> 00:51:50,817
Is there no end to your ignorance?!

603
00:51:55,338 --> 00:51:56,644
What the hell...

604
00:51:59,338 --> 00:52:00,826
What does it mean?!

605
00:52:02,538 --> 00:52:03,761
Akutagawa!

606
00:52:03,901 --> 00:52:06,808
If you know something, you need to tell me!

607
00:52:07,688 --> 00:52:09,871
You shouldn't go anywhere in your condition.

608
00:52:09,958 --> 00:52:11,511
Stay here and rest.

609
00:52:12,407 --> 00:52:13,698
Kyouka, hang on!

610
00:52:18,113 --> 00:52:19,980
I'm sorry I never told you.

611
00:52:20,487 --> 00:52:21,940
I didn't want you to know.

612
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:23,926
About what?

613
00:52:25,326 --> 00:52:28,313
That I control Demon Snow with my phone.

614
00:52:29,702 --> 00:52:32,076
I don't hate her despite what happened.

615
00:52:35,478 --> 00:52:37,686
I'm going to go and
complete the mission.

616
00:52:39,691 --> 00:52:41,531
Huh?! Wait a second...

617
00:52:43,902 --> 00:52:45,335
Kyouka...

618
00:52:49,391 --> 00:52:52,805
Kyouka!

619
00:52:55,869 --> 00:52:58,709
You're a no-good, piece of shit, you know that?

620
00:53:00,109 --> 00:53:01,213
What do you mean?

621
00:53:02,371 --> 00:53:08,450
Back when the Dragon Head Conflict was in full
swing, it was you bureaucrats who sent in Shibusawa.

622
00:53:08,623 --> 00:53:12,329
He was supposed to be your trump
card to end that bloody war.

623
00:53:12,413 --> 00:53:15,873
But he never had any intention
of maintaining peace, did he?

624
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:18,673
It just made things worse in the end.

625
00:53:18,866 --> 00:53:20,413
But even after all that,

626
00:53:20,496 --> 00:53:22,545
you still went out of your way to protect him,

627
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:29,121
Cause the truth is his power to combat a potential
nation-wide gifted uprising was just too valuable.

628
00:53:29,227 --> 00:53:30,340
That's why,

629
00:53:30,365 --> 00:53:35,339
not only did you turn a blind eye to
the high body count he created overseas,

630
00:53:35,644 --> 00:53:37,191
you covered it up.

631
00:53:37,277 --> 00:53:40,200
We did it in order to protect the peace of this nation.

632
00:53:41,756 --> 00:53:44,483
You really need to shut up, Doc Glasses.

633
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:48,258
If you hadn't unleashed that monster to begin with,

634
00:53:48,283 --> 00:53:51,374
all six of my friends would be still be alive right now.

635
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:53,360
Are you going to kill me?

636
00:53:54,054 --> 00:53:55,700
You're free to do so.

637
00:53:56,007 --> 00:53:57,329
I've been prepared for this

638
00:53:57,413 --> 00:53:59,617
ever since I decided to ask for your help

639
00:53:59,663 --> 00:54:00,617
Then it's a deal.

640
00:54:04,955 --> 00:54:06,587
I'll accept your job.

641
00:54:10,994 --> 00:54:12,354
And in return,

642
00:54:12,648 --> 00:54:14,441
you'll pay me with your life.

643
00:54:25,282 --> 00:54:27,276
All is going as planned.

644
00:54:27,329 --> 00:54:29,522
Yeah, all's going as planned.

645
00:54:29,782 --> 00:54:31,852
Wasn't exactly a cake walk though.

646
00:54:32,479 --> 00:54:35,599
Getting in without making
him suspicious was a pain.

647
00:54:36,916 --> 00:54:40,582
So, what's the real reason
you decided to team up with me?

648
00:54:41,229 --> 00:54:44,346
I simply wish to witness the world
as it ought to be.

649
00:54:45,445 --> 00:54:49,142
Would you not agree that the more
entertainment there is, the better?

650
00:54:49,426 --> 00:54:51,824
So, the Demon needs a clown?

651
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:53,104
I get it...

652
00:54:54,121 --> 00:54:56,580
I hadn't intended to make you an ally,

653
00:54:56,663 --> 00:54:59,747
but making Shibusawa the jester was necessary.

654
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:01,430
You gotta hand it to him.

655
00:55:01,455 --> 00:55:04,144
He's got the entire Japanese government by the balls.

656
00:55:04,244 --> 00:55:07,964
With the power he has at his
disposal, that's little surprise.

657
00:55:08,154 --> 00:55:12,308
He would have created Yokohama's
fog with or without your assistance.

658
00:55:13,181 --> 00:55:14,228
Now then...

659
00:55:14,788 --> 00:55:16,578
Here we have two crystals,

660
00:55:16,731 --> 00:55:20,324
one of which can summon all the
gifted as far as the eye can see...

661
00:55:21,006 --> 00:55:26,740
And the other one has the power to turn the
abilities of the gifted who touch it into crystals.

662
00:55:27,692 --> 00:55:31,755
With both of these in our possession,
we can destroy the entire collection,

663
00:55:31,968 --> 00:55:34,979
thereby starving the fog of an energy source.

664
00:55:35,239 --> 00:55:41,033
First, you have to dissolve both of these
crystals' form using your nullification ability.

665
00:55:41,273 --> 00:55:44,250
This will return those powers to their former state.

666
00:55:44,803 --> 00:55:47,103
I hope Atsushi and the others are safe.

667
00:56:06,103 --> 00:56:09,526
Once I lay my hands on that, this'll all be over.

668
00:56:13,913 --> 00:56:15,409
It's like I said,

669
00:56:15,722 --> 00:56:18,555
no one ever surpasses my expectations,

670
00:56:18,636 --> 00:56:20,210
and no one ever will.

671
00:56:22,843 --> 00:56:25,049
Didn't you lock the door?

672
00:56:28,216 --> 00:56:29,516
I see...

673
00:56:30,049 --> 00:56:31,723
There's more than one traitor.

674
00:56:32,183 --> 00:56:33,569
Didn't I tell you?

675
00:56:34,009 --> 00:56:36,414
The more excitement for this world, the better.

676
00:56:36,439 --> 00:56:37,485
Sure did...

677
00:56:40,513 --> 00:56:42,648
So, what comes next?

678
00:56:43,186 --> 00:56:44,913
There is no "next."

679
00:56:45,053 --> 00:56:49,303
From the very beginning, the one
who I had my sights set on was you.

680
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:53,892
I expected your special knife
would deal me a nasty wound, but...

681
00:56:54,852 --> 00:56:55,505
...poison?

682
00:56:55,815 --> 00:56:58,488
Yes, it's a lethal anesthetic.

683
00:56:58,828 --> 00:57:00,142
Can you taste it?

684
00:57:00,402 --> 00:57:02,936
The death you've so
longed for is upon you.

685
00:57:05,336 --> 00:57:07,320
How considerate of you.

686
00:57:08,672 --> 00:57:12,740
This feels so wonderful...

687
00:57:17,913 --> 00:57:20,198
Now that the original owner is deceased,

688
00:57:20,223 --> 00:57:22,716
his special ability is free for the taking.

689
00:57:23,096 --> 00:57:28,574
Ahh... For the first time in my
life, I can feel my heart racing!

690
00:57:34,122 --> 00:57:35,562
This is all wrong!

691
00:57:44,303 --> 00:57:45,637
What's happening?

692
00:57:54,093 --> 00:57:56,326
Don't you dare open that door.

693
00:57:57,853 --> 00:58:03,098
You have neither the courage of heart, nor
the dignity of your own self worth to do so.

694
00:58:03,598 --> 00:58:06,321
You've finally lost your gifted power,

695
00:58:06,401 --> 00:58:08,194
your tiger's ability.

696
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:10,635
Just let it go.

697
00:58:10,795 --> 00:58:13,455
No one expects anything from you anyway.

698
00:58:13,548 --> 00:58:16,085
I'm not listening to anything you have to say!

699
00:58:35,502 --> 00:58:38,682
Once you know the truth, you will never be the same.

700
00:58:40,082 --> 00:58:42,140
But if that is your choice,

701
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:45,453
you'll find the door is already unlocked.

702
00:58:46,426 --> 00:58:48,692
Go of your own free will...

703
00:58:49,185 --> 00:58:50,165
...and then...

704
00:58:51,132 --> 00:58:52,152
...die.

705
00:58:56,306 --> 00:58:59,599
The unification and neutralizing abilities...

706
00:59:00,076 --> 00:59:04,956
With these contradictory powers
joining together, a singularity is born.

707
00:59:07,488 --> 00:59:13,028
You were hoping that with Dazai's unique
ability, you might regain your lost memories.

708
00:59:13,904 --> 00:59:16,571
But you'll never remember
what happened to you.

709
00:59:17,738 --> 00:59:19,346
How do you know about that?!

710
00:59:19,371 --> 00:59:21,113
There's no need for concern.

711
00:59:21,275 --> 00:59:23,547
I'm going to fill in all the blanks for you.

712
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:26,597
I'll even tell you what was cut out.

713
00:59:30,203 --> 00:59:31,837
It was your death.

714
00:59:32,406 --> 00:59:34,752
Is it all coming back to you yet?

715
00:59:38,401 --> 00:59:39,861
This feeling...

716
00:59:44,508 --> 00:59:45,788
I remember...

717
00:59:47,134 --> 00:59:49,294
I've felt this before.

718
00:59:54,038 --> 00:59:58,188
No one in this place understands your special ability.

719
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:03,502
Your power is rare, perhaps the
only one of its kind in the world.

720
01:00:03,595 --> 01:00:08,072
It's the only ability that has
earned the envy of all other gifted.

721
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:12,449
I'm not able to draw your ability out even with my fog.

722
01:00:12,689 --> 01:00:15,189
It seems to be buried deep within you.

723
01:00:15,402 --> 01:00:17,318
Perhaps it's because of your youth.

724
01:00:18,091 --> 01:00:19,652
Onto plan B.

725
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:26,163
Now,

726
01:00:26,609 --> 01:00:29,496
let's see what surprises you have in store for me.

727
01:01:00,496 --> 01:01:02,034
Is that me?

728
01:01:32,369 --> 01:01:33,243
Yes...

729
01:01:34,076 --> 01:01:35,429
I remember now.

730
01:01:36,783 --> 01:01:39,140
That was the moment I used my claws.

731
01:01:39,326 --> 01:01:41,633
That was the moment I used my claws.

732
01:01:41,806 --> 01:01:44,160
That was the moment I used my claws.

733
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:46,737
That was the moment I used my claws.

734
01:01:47,197 --> 01:01:49,437
That was the moment I used my claws.

735
01:01:49,843 --> 01:01:52,057
That was the moment I used my claws.

736
01:01:52,524 --> 01:01:54,691
That was the moment I used my claws.

737
01:01:54,904 --> 01:01:58,084
I remember that moment I hit the switch.

738
01:01:58,968 --> 01:02:01,263
I did it because a Russian man told me

739
01:02:01,288 --> 01:02:05,133
that your power was coveted by
all the gifted who knew of it.

740
01:02:06,099 --> 01:02:09,170
The Russian's name was Fyodor.

741
01:02:09,343 --> 01:02:10,723
Exactly.

742
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:13,356
That was the day you died.

743
01:02:14,204 --> 01:02:17,534
But after you died, your ability remained intact.

744
01:02:17,827 --> 01:02:22,091
Your ability didn't need your
body in order to continue its search.

745
01:02:22,477 --> 01:02:25,477
You had even forgotten your own death.

746
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:30,481
But your ability made this room
to manage your growing collection.

747
01:02:32,042 --> 01:02:34,409
And now this is what you have become.

748
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:41,808
That was the moment I used my claws.

749
01:02:42,248 --> 01:02:43,501
That's right.

750
01:02:43,788 --> 01:02:46,498
That was the moment when you killed me,

751
01:02:46,825 --> 01:02:48,626
using those claws.

752
01:02:48,657 --> 01:02:50,524
What do you expect me to do?!

753
01:02:50,663 --> 01:02:52,630
I didn't want to just die there!

754
01:02:52,655 --> 01:02:54,101
You pushed me too hard,

755
01:02:54,139 --> 01:02:57,121
I had to use the
tiger's claws to survive!

756
01:03:03,258 --> 01:03:05,385
It's the beginning of the end.

757
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:07,202
Huh?

758
01:03:09,102 --> 01:03:12,403
Dazai, you're still here I see.

759
01:03:12,876 --> 01:03:17,166
Did you wish to witness this
city's demise from beyond the grave?

760
01:03:23,923 --> 01:03:26,010
In thanks to our new found friendship,

761
01:03:26,083 --> 01:03:29,130
I'll offer you a bite from the apple of knowledge.

762
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:35,460
Even in the midst of the fog, my special
ability did not turn against me like the others.

763
01:03:35,705 --> 01:03:37,437
Do you know why that is?

764
01:03:46,701 --> 01:03:48,054
I am crime.

765
01:03:48,474 --> 01:03:49,968
I am punishment.

766
01:03:50,062 --> 01:03:51,663
Did you not know?

767
01:03:51,747 --> 01:03:54,542
Crime and punishment are close acquaintances.

768
01:03:54,913 --> 01:03:57,329
The borders that contain us vanish.

769
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,172
And new rooms awaken.

770
01:04:00,955 --> 01:04:02,879
To the incarnation of death,

771
01:04:03,141 --> 01:04:05,794
the master of the ability-consuming fog...

772
01:04:06,048 --> 01:04:08,248
...obey your instinct to consume...

773
01:04:08,466 --> 01:04:10,776
Go on a rampage and roar!

774
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:14,847
This isn't a singularity or loss of control.

775
01:04:18,025 --> 01:04:23,232
This is the dragon, the true form
of the chaos of special abilities.

776
01:04:32,719 --> 01:04:34,553
Anomaly readings are increasing.

777
01:04:34,619 --> 01:04:37,149
They're five times higher than they were six years ago.

778
01:04:37,222 --> 01:04:39,522
Make that five and half times higher and growing!

779
01:04:39,663 --> 01:04:41,961
What's the status of A5158?

780
01:04:42,876 --> 01:04:45,329
Try to keep your shit, would you?

781
01:04:52,545 --> 01:04:53,325
Chuuya...

782
01:04:53,705 --> 01:04:56,830
By now, it's likely Dazai has been eliminated.

783
01:04:56,913 --> 01:04:59,666
If you use your corrupted form, then you'll...

784
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:01,553
I don't give a damn about that.

785
01:05:01,893 --> 01:05:03,293
Why would you say that?

786
01:05:03,621 --> 01:05:07,420
Then you won't be able to take my
life as your reward for doing the job.

787
01:05:08,087 --> 01:05:10,080
Don't get cocky, asshole.

788
01:05:11,279 --> 01:05:14,851
You were just a lowly infiltrator six years ago.

789
01:05:14,955 --> 01:05:19,099
Nobody listened to you when you said
it was a mistake to hire Shibusawa.

790
01:05:20,102 --> 01:05:22,398
He's the one who screwed things up.

791
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:26,619
That idiot Dazai is still alive in that tower...

792
01:05:27,169 --> 01:05:28,109
I'm sure of it.

793
01:05:28,702 --> 01:05:30,689
I'm gonna go give him a good smack.

794
01:05:31,389 --> 01:05:32,522
I'm hanging up.

795
01:05:36,513 --> 01:05:37,839
I'm counting on you.

796
01:05:41,329 --> 01:05:42,803
We're approaching the target.

797
01:05:45,629 --> 01:05:47,763
Aren't you the chick I saw a while back?

798
01:05:47,788 --> 01:05:48,894
I'm Tsujimura.

799
01:05:49,872 --> 01:05:51,661
Do you really intend to do this?

800
01:05:52,251 --> 01:05:53,038
Yeah.

801
01:05:53,121 --> 01:05:54,327
It'll never work.

802
01:05:55,001 --> 01:05:56,567
You're not in the same league!

803
01:05:56,741 --> 01:05:59,574
That monster is beyond human comprehension.

804
01:06:00,121 --> 01:06:01,277
Try to fight it,

805
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:03,317
and you're gonna die.

806
01:06:04,163 --> 01:06:08,373
You're gonna have to give me a better
reason than that to chicken out and go home.

807
01:06:10,463 --> 01:06:13,574
Do you know when it's okay to chicken out and go home?

808
01:06:17,671 --> 01:06:18,605
No, I don't.

809
01:06:19,798 --> 01:06:22,511
Well, the answer's never.

810
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:30,904
Grantors of dark disgrace...

811
01:06:34,614 --> 01:06:36,194
You need not...

812
01:06:36,496 --> 01:06:38,939
You need not wake me again!

813
01:06:58,147 --> 01:06:59,615
The readings are all rising.

814
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:00,709
What's happening?

815
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,356
His special ability
is gravity control.

816
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:05,256
However,

817
01:07:05,705 --> 01:07:10,103
in his current state of Corruption,
he's not lucid enough to control that power.

818
01:07:10,413 --> 01:07:12,189
And neither can he disable it.

819
01:07:12,343 --> 01:07:15,069
Are you saying the only way
to stop it is for him to die?

820
01:07:15,246 --> 01:07:19,874
We only know of one other method that
works and that's Dazai's nullification ability.

821
01:07:20,194 --> 01:07:21,074
Without that...

822
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:22,866
There's no hope for him.

823
01:07:22,966 --> 01:07:23,732
No...

824
01:08:35,163 --> 01:08:43,287
Dazai!!!

825
01:09:35,091 --> 01:09:38,477
You used Corruption, believing that I would save you?

826
01:09:38,737 --> 01:09:40,064
How beautiful.

827
01:09:40,557 --> 01:09:47,802
What I believed in, was your disgusting
craftiness and stubborn refusal to ever die.

828
01:09:48,131 --> 01:09:49,504
A small critique,

829
01:09:49,617 --> 01:09:52,991
that was a rather violent way to wake up Snow White.

830
01:09:53,117 --> 01:09:56,782
Snow White never hid a poison antidote in her mouth.

831
01:09:57,455 --> 01:09:59,495
You knew I was gonna punch you.

832
01:10:03,552 --> 01:10:05,565
Let go off me, asshole.

833
01:10:05,605 --> 01:10:06,512
Stay still.

834
01:10:06,817 --> 01:10:07,810
Why?

835
01:10:07,943 --> 01:10:10,457
The fog hasn't
lifted from this area.

836
01:10:10,590 --> 01:10:15,933
I'd rather not have to protect you against
your own special ability at this very moment.

837
01:10:16,127 --> 01:10:18,167
It's still not over?

838
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:19,627
Afraid not...

839
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,377
It's just beginning.

840
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:23,490
Dammit.

841
01:10:23,557 --> 01:10:26,149
Well I'm not going
anywhere right now.

842
01:10:26,409 --> 01:10:28,429
I think I'm gonna pass out.

843
01:10:30,371 --> 01:10:32,536
I was able to predict this much.

844
01:10:33,146 --> 01:10:34,180
But now...

845
01:10:34,526 --> 01:10:36,400
The rest is all on them.

846
01:10:38,969 --> 01:10:41,022
You acted as though you knew everything,

847
01:10:41,069 --> 01:10:43,215
when the reality was quite the opposite.

848
01:10:43,609 --> 01:10:48,272
This fog will continue to spread
until Earth becomes a dead apple.

849
01:10:48,512 --> 01:10:51,446
The entire planet will be a fruit of death.

850
01:10:52,086 --> 01:10:54,711
I have a small gift I'd like to impart to you.

851
01:10:55,771 --> 01:10:58,921
It's a fragment of the crystal that gathers abilities.

852
01:11:00,468 --> 01:11:04,095
Using this, you are the singularity.

853
01:11:12,621 --> 01:11:15,354
I remember everything, now.

854
01:11:16,081 --> 01:11:20,598
What I was seeking wasn't a special
ability to transcend all others.

855
01:11:20,758 --> 01:11:26,705
It was the glimmer of light of a tenacious life
force that would prevail over my special ability.

856
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:29,143
It was stronger than my own fate.

857
01:11:29,830 --> 01:11:31,263
By killing me,

858
01:11:31,443 --> 01:11:35,033
your soul had demonstrated for me the power of life.

859
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,456
Show me your light once more!

860
01:12:13,448 --> 01:12:15,155
The fog has begun to spread again!

861
01:12:15,652 --> 01:12:17,982
The singularity variance is immeasurable.

862
01:12:18,132 --> 01:12:21,003
It's expanding at 120 kilometers per hour.

863
01:12:21,277 --> 01:12:25,657
At this rate, the whole Kanto region
will be engulfed in one hour and 35 minutes.

864
01:12:26,079 --> 01:12:29,334
In 12 hours and 36 minutes, it will be all of Tokyo,

865
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:32,685
and in 168 hours, the entire planet!

866
01:12:34,117 --> 01:12:35,391
Are you serious?

867
01:12:35,769 --> 01:12:36,422
Wait...

868
01:12:36,621 --> 01:12:40,411
We have an incoming call from the
English special operations organization.

869
01:12:40,997 --> 01:12:43,850
It's... from the Order of the Clock Tower.

870
01:12:46,104 --> 01:12:47,817
A good day to you all.

871
01:12:48,663 --> 01:12:50,621
On behalf of the nations of Europe,

872
01:12:50,755 --> 01:12:54,135
our hearts go out to your country in this time of need.

873
01:12:54,609 --> 01:12:59,804
On that note however, in order to prevent this
crisis from spreading to the rest of the world,

874
01:13:00,079 --> 01:13:03,787
we have deployed a gifted agent
with an incineration ability.

875
01:13:08,475 --> 01:13:10,204
An incineration ability...?!

876
01:13:10,877 --> 01:13:12,031
When does he arrive?

877
01:13:12,564 --> 01:13:16,294
Exactly 30 minutes; at the very crack of dawn.

878
01:13:18,698 --> 01:13:21,572
They're going to burn Yokohama to the ground.

879
01:13:26,362 --> 01:13:28,715
I've found you, Shibusawa.

880
01:13:29,129 --> 01:13:30,749
Rashoumon!

881
01:13:33,661 --> 01:13:34,921
Demonic...

882
01:13:37,589 --> 01:13:38,752
...Armor!

883
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:44,613
Ho ho...

884
01:13:45,147 --> 01:13:47,353
You two are gifted, I assume?

885
01:13:47,993 --> 01:13:49,776
What's he mean "you two"?

886
01:13:52,043 --> 01:13:53,376
Why are you here?

887
01:13:53,749 --> 01:13:54,773
It's very simple.

888
01:13:54,973 --> 01:13:57,747
I just want Atsushi to continue to live in the light.

889
01:13:58,507 --> 01:14:01,017
So I'll be the one who kills this man.

890
01:14:01,383 --> 01:14:02,830
Come, Demon Snow!

891
01:14:10,236 --> 01:14:15,519
How remarkable that two gifteds were
able to take back their special abilities.

892
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:17,870
We have taken
our abilities back.

893
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:20,010
And we won't be
the only ones who do!

894
01:14:23,633 --> 01:14:27,980
I expect this, too, was within
your calculations, wasn't it, Dazai?

895
01:14:28,517 --> 01:14:29,330
Oh...

896
01:14:29,637 --> 01:14:32,404
Looks like I have my own guest to entertain.

897
01:14:35,567 --> 01:14:38,233
Rintarou... I love you!

898
01:14:42,344 --> 01:14:44,604
My adorable, dear Elise.

899
01:14:44,997 --> 01:14:47,330
I can't bring myself to slice you up.

900
01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:48,966
Dear me...

901
01:14:49,229 --> 01:14:51,286
What is the optimal solution here?

902
01:14:56,161 --> 01:14:58,761
It's logical your swordsmanship would equal mine.

903
01:14:59,038 --> 01:15:00,708
Our skills may be matched,

904
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:04,225
but you're far too conservative to gain the upper hand.

905
01:15:04,561 --> 01:15:07,294
Without a devious nature to your strikes,

906
01:15:07,408 --> 01:15:09,851
you have no hope of winning against me.

907
01:15:12,165 --> 01:15:14,271
That you, Master Fukuzawa?

908
01:15:17,507 --> 01:15:18,627
Mr. Mori.

909
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:20,154
What a coincidence.

910
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:22,323
Encountering some difficulties?

911
01:15:22,717 --> 01:15:25,135
I think I may have a solution to our problem,

912
01:15:25,415 --> 01:15:27,051
how to bring this to an end.

913
01:15:27,537 --> 01:15:29,207
What excellent news.

914
01:15:29,371 --> 01:15:31,663
When you think of everything we've done till now,

915
01:15:31,747 --> 01:15:35,691
doesn't it seem like our actions
were merely a rehearsal for this moment?

916
01:15:47,031 --> 01:15:49,604
I thought you only used your scalpel.

917
01:15:50,891 --> 01:15:52,671
I'll be mindful of that.

918
01:15:53,288 --> 01:15:56,684
Yet it's the Silver Wolf who showed a sweet girl no mercy.

919
01:15:56,831 --> 01:16:00,290
The way I see it. You're the one to watch out for.

920
01:16:00,468 --> 01:16:02,454
That thing was nothing but a fiend.

921
01:16:03,163 --> 01:16:05,706
Heyyyyy, Rintarouuuu!

922
01:16:06,066 --> 01:16:09,099
Just what the heck were you
thinking, leaving me behiiiind?!

923
01:16:09,166 --> 01:16:11,809
It's so nice to see the real Elise.

924
01:16:11,889 --> 01:16:14,669
Still a fiend, as far as I'm concerned.

925
01:16:21,801 --> 01:16:24,375
Is there even a spark left to my life?

926
01:16:25,368 --> 01:16:28,630
No matter where I look, I can't seem to find it.

927
01:16:29,413 --> 01:16:31,550
When the fog took away my ability,

928
01:16:31,723 --> 01:16:33,436
I was honestly relieved.

929
01:16:34,410 --> 01:16:36,447
Now that we were two separate beings,

930
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:38,820
I wouldn't have to hurt anyone again.

931
01:16:43,937 --> 01:16:45,324
But then I remembered,

932
01:16:45,837 --> 01:16:48,230
that the tiger actually saved me once.

933
01:16:56,251 --> 01:16:59,731
I've been consumed by the
jaws of death once before.

934
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:03,281
How do you expect to kill
something that is already dead?!

935
01:17:03,846 --> 01:17:05,333
You abomination!

936
01:17:10,121 --> 01:17:13,498
No matter much I run, the tiger still follows.

937
01:17:16,735 --> 01:17:17,584
Huh?

938
01:17:18,978 --> 01:17:22,295
I might as well be trying to
escape the beating of my own heart.

939
01:17:23,402 --> 01:17:27,799
This whole time, you've been
the strength I've used to stay alive.

940
01:17:33,225 --> 01:17:36,162
I can hear you more clearly than ever now.

941
01:17:37,121 --> 01:17:38,889
I understand you now.

942
01:17:42,455 --> 01:17:43,952
And I can feel...

943
01:17:44,913 --> 01:17:47,746
the fire in everyone's spirit.

944
01:17:53,429 --> 01:17:55,580
I expect the same from you.

945
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:00,193
If you don't keep up, I'll leave you behind.

946
01:18:01,038 --> 01:18:03,350
Tiger! Let's get out there!

947
01:18:13,621 --> 01:18:14,936
Look at your faces.

948
01:18:15,121 --> 01:18:17,483
I have taken your last spark of hope.

949
01:18:17,788 --> 01:18:18,784
However...

950
01:18:18,883 --> 01:18:21,613
I want so much more than that!

951
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:24,193
Huh?

952
01:18:30,361 --> 01:18:33,041
The dragon and the tiger deserve each other.

953
01:18:36,204 --> 01:18:40,405
The Russian who told me of your
existence also told me about the dragon,

954
01:18:40,712 --> 01:18:45,162
and how it is the true form of
the chaos of special abilities.

955
01:18:47,231 --> 01:18:48,104
Therefore,

956
01:18:48,634 --> 01:18:53,404
when you embody the tiger, you become
the antithesis of all special abilities.

957
01:18:53,429 --> 01:18:54,288
Finally.

958
01:18:54,764 --> 01:18:55,814
Took you long enough.

959
01:18:56,274 --> 01:18:58,955
So tell me, Atsushi Nakajima,

960
01:18:59,121 --> 01:19:00,885
plan to kill me again?

961
01:19:02,995 --> 01:19:06,972
I'm only here to put a certain
thing back where it already belongs.

962
01:19:07,014 --> 01:19:08,781
Then you should understand,

963
01:19:09,205 --> 01:19:10,871
I won't stop you!

964
01:19:13,959 --> 01:19:15,795
Very good!

965
01:19:16,162 --> 01:19:19,463
But then, you are quite special indeed!

966
01:19:22,705 --> 01:19:27,054
You have single-handedly cured my boredom!

967
01:19:48,556 --> 01:19:49,790
Demon Snow!

968
01:19:57,056 --> 01:19:58,876
This city is where we belong,

969
01:19:59,163 --> 01:20:01,796
and the three of us have to work together to protect it.

970
01:20:03,066 --> 01:20:03,760
Huh?

971
01:20:05,753 --> 01:20:07,080
It's up to us.

972
01:20:07,121 --> 01:20:08,834
Can you call Demon Snow again?

973
01:20:11,275 --> 01:20:13,622
Both of you, listen to me.

974
01:20:14,913 --> 01:20:16,663
If we're gonna bring him down,

975
01:20:16,782 --> 01:20:18,738
you know what we need to do, right?

976
01:20:19,572 --> 01:20:21,385
Yeah... I do.

977
01:20:23,163 --> 01:20:23,905
Kyouka...

978
01:20:26,705 --> 01:20:29,822
Earlier, you told me you couldn't hate Demon Snow.

979
01:20:30,522 --> 01:20:32,251
I know she'll respond to you.

980
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:50,674
Your naivete is so beautiful.

981
01:20:52,830 --> 01:20:53,820
Now, Kyouka!

982
01:20:54,547 --> 01:20:56,914
Demon Snow, defeat my enemy!

983
01:21:04,282 --> 01:21:06,948
You can't think this is enough to stop me!

984
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:10,203
Your turn, Akutagawa!

985
01:21:10,228 --> 01:21:12,054
As if I need your permission!

986
01:21:19,211 --> 01:21:20,784
You won't get away this time.

987
01:21:27,368 --> 01:21:28,604
This is it...

988
01:21:29,029 --> 01:21:30,849
This is it!

989
01:21:31,311 --> 01:21:34,854
The ecstasy of feeling my death.

990
01:21:36,394 --> 01:21:38,124
Do you wish to feel it, too?!

991
01:21:42,011 --> 01:21:42,965
What's happening?

992
01:21:50,422 --> 01:21:53,442
Show me once more that glimmer of light,

993
01:21:53,636 --> 01:21:56,469
the one that can oppose all gifted powers!

994
01:22:08,139 --> 01:22:09,306
Beautiful...

995
01:22:10,182 --> 01:22:13,642
This is indeed the pinnacle
of special abilities!

996
01:22:14,016 --> 01:22:14,825
Wrong!

997
01:22:16,705 --> 01:22:17,452
What?!

998
01:22:18,552 --> 01:22:20,527
It's much more than an ability.

999
01:22:21,273 --> 01:22:24,420
That thing is me!

1000
01:22:49,663 --> 01:22:50,485
Yes.

1001
01:22:50,944 --> 01:22:53,317
Now I understand everything.

1002
01:22:54,417 --> 01:22:56,271
The answer to why I'm here,

1003
01:22:56,697 --> 01:22:59,472
the purpose of you appearing before me,

1004
01:22:59,631 --> 01:23:01,712
and the meaning of that man's words,

1005
01:23:02,172 --> 01:23:04,589
I understand all of it now.

1006
01:23:06,129 --> 01:23:07,155
It's you.

1007
01:23:08,449 --> 01:23:12,192
You must be the angel who has come just to save me.

1008
01:24:08,101 --> 01:24:08,810
Hmm...

1009
01:24:10,969 --> 01:24:11,730
Huh?

1010
01:24:30,443 --> 01:24:34,190
Sir, both the singularity and the fog have disappeared.

1011
01:24:39,752 --> 01:24:43,465
The Order of the Clock Tower has informed
us that they have aborted their mission.

1012
01:24:47,034 --> 01:24:48,294
What a shame.

1013
01:24:48,888 --> 01:24:53,221
The scent of a burning nation
would've gone well with my tea.

1014
01:24:56,731 --> 01:24:58,917
What the hell are you doing here?

1015
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:02,350
Dazai's fine if that's who you were looking for.

1016
01:25:09,707 --> 01:25:10,487
Hey...

1017
01:25:13,034 --> 01:25:14,440
Help me with my hat?

1018
01:25:17,961 --> 01:25:21,242
Well, I'm not a gifted, and I ended up back here fine.

1019
01:25:21,316 --> 01:25:23,682
So things must have worked out well in the end.

1020
01:25:24,009 --> 01:25:26,909
It seems Atsushi's become pretty competent.

1021
01:25:27,242 --> 01:25:28,819
Wouldn't you agree, Dazai?

1022
01:25:42,722 --> 01:25:46,055
Atsushi, about what I was doing earlier...

1023
01:25:46,408 --> 01:25:47,808
What you were doing...?

1024
01:25:48,602 --> 01:25:52,045
I know that everything you did was to protect this city.

1025
01:25:53,305 --> 01:25:56,795
Do I really look like someone
who's overflowing with virtue to you?

1026
01:25:57,689 --> 01:25:59,395
Uh, yeah, you do.

1027
01:26:01,269 --> 01:26:03,032
Well, if ya say so.

1028
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:13,666
I hope he was able to find the escape from
loneliness and boredom he was searching for.

1029
01:26:15,345 --> 01:26:17,958
Is that the same thing you've been searching for?

1030
01:26:20,329 --> 01:26:23,668
If it was possible for Shibusawa
to forget he'd been killed,

1031
01:26:24,155 --> 01:26:27,682
I'm pretty sure Dazai can forget
about his own past one more time.

1032
01:26:29,105 --> 01:26:30,625
But this much is true.

1033
01:26:31,158 --> 01:26:32,872
We protected this city,

1034
01:26:32,972 --> 01:26:35,963
and I'm so proud that we were able to do it together.

1035
01:26:36,623 --> 01:26:39,769
I think the world is a little
more beautiful now because of that.

1036
01:26:40,621 --> 01:26:43,140
And because I have all of you in my life.

1037
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:54,876
Heyyy!

1038
01:26:57,723 --> 01:27:00,444
I see you blockheads are all still alive!

1039
01:27:00,830 --> 01:27:02,464
They made it out safe too!

1040
01:27:02,918 --> 01:27:04,058
Of course they did.

1041
01:27:04,518 --> 01:27:06,961
We are the Armed Detective Agency...

1042
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:09,363
...aren't we?

1043
01:27:12,127 --> 01:27:13,120
Yeah.

1044
01:27:21,277 --> 01:27:25,554
It's a miracle that after everything that
happened, there were no civilian casualties.

1045
01:27:25,821 --> 01:27:27,787
We were really quite lucky.

1046
01:27:30,547 --> 01:27:33,371
I know we've been working non-stop for days now,

1047
01:27:33,591 --> 01:27:35,884
but we need to keep at it, Tsujimura.

1048
01:27:36,098 --> 01:27:39,656
It's hopeless! We'll never cover all of this up!

1049
01:27:40,204 --> 01:27:45,290
Even though the damage was confined to a
small zone in Yokohama, it was pretty extensive.

1050
01:27:47,428 --> 01:27:48,447
Hey, boss...

1051
01:27:48,538 --> 01:27:49,033
Hm?

1052
01:27:50,073 --> 01:27:52,747
I still don't understand exactly what happened.

1053
01:27:52,830 --> 01:27:54,116
Can you explain it?

1054
01:27:54,788 --> 01:27:56,229
I don't know myself.

1055
01:27:56,717 --> 01:28:00,830
Given the complexity of the three individuals
who were at the center of the conflict,

1056
01:28:00,855 --> 01:28:02,580
we may never get a full picture.

1057
01:28:04,222 --> 01:28:06,304
Dazai's always been enigmatic,

1058
01:28:06,329 --> 01:28:10,096
and the motives of that demon
Fyodor are impossible to fathom.

1059
01:28:10,778 --> 01:28:11,547
Still...

1060
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:15,580
Let's assume those two told each other nothing but lies.

1061
01:28:15,954 --> 01:28:19,131
Then the fundamental truth might be deceptively simple.

1062
01:28:19,898 --> 01:28:20,498
Huh?

1063
01:28:21,788 --> 01:28:25,142
Shibusawa possessed an unnatural degree of intelligence.

1064
01:28:26,344 --> 01:28:28,260
He couldn't understand other people.

1065
01:28:28,647 --> 01:28:29,754
He could use them.

1066
01:28:30,114 --> 01:28:31,020
Destroy them.

1067
01:28:31,374 --> 01:28:33,664
Or he might have even wanted to save them.

1068
01:28:34,384 --> 01:28:37,464
Actually all three of them seem much like aliens.

1069
01:28:37,747 --> 01:28:39,941
Lonely and isolated in the world.

1070
01:28:40,914 --> 01:28:43,441
I'm not sure I would be able to live like that!

1071
01:28:44,079 --> 01:28:44,747
Uh...

1072
01:28:44,830 --> 01:28:46,445
Miss... Tsujimura?

1073
01:28:48,705 --> 01:28:51,940
You knew he'd have a trick up
his sleeve, didn't you, boss?

1074
01:28:52,315 --> 01:28:55,454
Well, with Dazai acting on his own,

1075
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:58,028
I expected he would need your help.

1076
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,741
To set the stage, so to speak.

1077
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:02,871
So I was just the opening act?

1078
01:29:03,038 --> 01:29:06,580
You know full well that Dazai decides the star.

1079
01:29:06,830 --> 01:29:09,557
So, what's my payment then?

1080
01:29:10,243 --> 01:29:12,497
The return of order to this city.

1081
01:29:13,457 --> 01:29:15,837
I get life-long bragging rights?

1082
01:29:16,038 --> 01:29:17,477
I guess I can live with that.

1083
01:29:17,884 --> 01:29:19,645
Excellent job, Chuuya.

1084
01:29:20,085 --> 01:29:22,429
Nah, you don't have to commend me.

1085
01:29:22,685 --> 01:29:23,842
It was your order.

1086
01:29:24,038 --> 01:29:25,994
I was just doing my job.

1087
01:29:27,521 --> 01:29:29,717
Everything is just entertainment.

1088
01:29:30,254 --> 01:29:34,246
However, this world, so rife with crime and punishment,

1089
01:29:34,717 --> 01:29:38,487
and in order to finally end it, I do need that novel.

1090
01:29:39,538 --> 01:29:43,081
A special book that sleeps somewhere within this city.

1091
01:29:44,364 --> 01:29:46,589
And lastly, do not insult our clients!

1092
01:29:46,621 --> 01:29:47,887
Is that understood?

1093
01:29:47,967 --> 01:29:51,545
You really are like the Agency's
mommy, aren't you, Kunikida?

1094
01:29:51,767 --> 01:29:52,692
Mommy?!

1095
01:29:54,246 --> 01:29:56,832
Hey! Don't work too hard out there, you two!

1096
01:29:56,955 --> 01:29:57,788
Off you go then.

1097
01:29:58,188 --> 01:29:59,468
Take care, okay!

1098
01:29:59,942 --> 01:30:02,322
We will. See ya later, guys!
