1
00:01:52,538 --> 00:01:53,061
Hey.

2
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:01,932
Good evening.

3
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:03,192
Oh, hi, Shizuku.

4
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,190
I'm back.

5
00:02:12,706 --> 00:02:13,599
Oh, hi, honey.

6
00:02:14,347 --> 00:02:17,214
You got a plastic bag for just one carton of milk?

7
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:18,756
What? They just give it to you.

8
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,830
You could say you don't need it.

9
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:22,315
Oh, pour me some of that, too.

10
00:02:22,481 --> 00:02:24,667
Dad, I got ice tea. Do you want some?

11
00:02:24,925 --> 00:02:28,190
Ah, sounds good. I'll have it at the table.

12
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:30,580
Thanks. Done with the computer?

13
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:31,738
I'm printing out now.

14
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:35,018
Maybe we should buy another laptop.

15
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:38,713
Smells like cigarettes in here.

16
00:02:39,018 --> 00:02:41,791
Shizuku, you should have gone to Kashiwazaki, too.

17
00:02:42,178 --> 00:02:44,486
No, I didn't want to. Shiho wears me out.

18
00:02:45,371 --> 00:02:47,227
Oh, by the way, I have to work tomorrow.

19
00:02:47,402 --> 00:02:48,914
Do you want me to fix you a lunch?

20
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,511
That's OK. I'll eat out.

21
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:54,648
The library's computerizing everything,
so everybody's going crazy at work.

22
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:57,881
I don't think they should, Dad.
Card catalogs are much better.

23
00:02:58,691 --> 00:03:00,359
Yeah. I like 'em better, too.

24
00:03:00,623 --> 00:03:02,822
Honey, I think you've got a problem with your report.

25
00:03:03,126 --> 00:03:03,953
What's the problem?

26
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:05,442
Isn't there a line missing here?

27
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,421
You're right. Darn.

28
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:09,401
I'll have to print the entire thing over.

29
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:12,221
Can't I use the printer first? My professor will kill me

30
00:03:12,237 --> 00:03:14,365
if I don't have this paper turned in first thing tomorrow.

31
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:17,092
Huh? Seiji Amasawa.

32
00:03:17,817 --> 00:03:19,417
Here he is again.

33
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:24,072
Shizuku, time to put the books away and go to bed.

34
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:25,012
OK, Dad. Good night.

35
00:03:33,736 --> 00:03:36,674
Yep. I knew I had seen that name before.

36
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,630
Here it is again.

37
00:03:41,619 --> 00:03:42,620
And again.

38
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:44,411
Seiji Amasawa.

39
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,476
Seiji Amasawa.

40
00:03:46,923 --> 00:03:49,387
Seiji Amasawa. That's amazing.

41
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:52,091
This guy checked out all these books before I did.

42
00:03:59,463 --> 00:04:01,122
Seiji Amasawa, huh?

43
00:04:01,285 --> 00:04:02,759
What kind of person are you?

44
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,151
I wonder if we're anything alike.

45
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:25,597
Shizuku! For heaven sakes, get up!

46
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:26,750
I'm leaving.

47
00:04:29,777 --> 00:04:31,904
Hey, did you sleep in your clothes again?

48
00:04:32,047 --> 00:04:33,249
You're so scatterbrained.

49
00:04:34,827 --> 00:04:36,133
Have a good day.

50
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,850
Ah! Is it that late? I'm supposed to meet Yuko.

51
00:04:45,086 --> 00:04:46,268
My wallet!

52
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,847
Did you get all the way down the stairs again, Mom?

53
00:04:50,255 --> 00:04:53,546
Yes! Where is it?

54
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:55,668
Is it by the telephone?

55
00:04:56,618 --> 00:04:57,729
Found it!

56
00:04:57,855 --> 00:04:59,217
You always leave it there.

57
00:04:59,738 --> 00:05:00,726
I'm gonna be late!

58
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:02,178
Don't forget to lock up!

59
00:05:02,193 --> 00:05:03,282
Who's scatterbrained?

60
00:05:12,102 --> 00:05:14,307
Wow! I've never seen a blimp so close.

61
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:20,568
Today's gonna be great.

62
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,798
Hot day.

63
00:05:56,337 --> 00:05:58,884
Hi, Yappy. Can't you bark any louder than that?

64
00:06:21,845 --> 00:06:24,464
Shizuku! Shizuku! Hey, there.

65
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,575
Hey, Michiko. Good luck on your match today.

66
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:32,812
Hi, Miss Kosaka. Can I come in?

67
00:06:33,464 --> 00:06:36,166
Oh, hi, Shizuku. What are you doing here?

68
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,252
I need you to do me a favor.

69
00:06:38,348 --> 00:06:40,829
What? It's not something weird, is it?

70
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,673
Can you open the library, please?

71
00:06:42,688 --> 00:06:43,825
The library?

72
00:06:44,244 --> 00:06:46,177
Can't you wait until school starts?

73
00:06:46,962 --> 00:06:48,147
No. That's the point.

74
00:06:48,163 --> 00:06:51,031
I decided I was gonna read 20 books over summer vacation,

75
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:53,350
and the city library doesn't have the book I want.

76
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:54,502
It'll just be a second.

77
00:06:54,987 --> 00:06:58,181
Twenty books? What about your high school entrance exams?

78
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,312
Can't you even pretend to be studying for them?

79
00:07:00,424 --> 00:07:02,271
Uh... Here it is.

80
00:07:02,508 --> 00:07:03,916
Hurry up and bring it here.

81
00:07:05,604 --> 00:07:08,623
Come on, give me your library card
and the checkout card from the book.

82
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,131
Here you go.

83
00:07:12,116 --> 00:07:13,411
Hey, look at this.

84
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:15,230
No one's ever checked this book out before.

85
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:17,586
No one? What do you know.

86
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:19,935
I finally beat Seiji Amasawa.

87
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:29,342
Donated by... Amasawa?

88
00:07:30,296 --> 00:07:33,584
No way! Do you have any idea who this Amasawa person is?

89
00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:36,516
Oh, now look, you made me make a mistake.

90
00:07:36,984 --> 00:07:38,900
Well, that guy's probably the book's donor.

91
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,376
But I don't know anyone from that long ago.

92
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:42,142
You'll have to ask one of the older teachers.

93
00:07:42,157 --> 00:07:43,245
Shizuku!

94
00:07:44,408 --> 00:07:46,648
I should have known that you were going to do this.

95
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:48,915
You said to meet outside the school, not inside.

96
00:07:48,931 --> 00:07:53,089
I waited in the sun for 15 minutes. Do
you know how many freckles I have now?

97
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:53,963
I'm sorry.

98
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:55,630
Calm down, Yuko.

99
00:07:55,646 --> 00:07:57,888
You take your freckles way too seriously.

100
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,701
No, I don't! It's a major problem for me.

101
00:08:00,717 --> 00:08:03,179
Aren't either of you concerned about your exams?

102
00:08:03,297 --> 00:08:04,990
Now, get out and go study.

103
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:07,303
I got it!

104
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:10,909
Here! This way.

105
00:08:11,854 --> 00:08:13,564
You gotta kick it harder than that.

106
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:16,106
I wrote some lyrics for our graduation ceremony,

107
00:08:16,806 --> 00:08:18,394
but I'm pretty sure that they stink.

108
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,550
<i>Looking over sprawling city</i>

109
00:08:23,815 --> 00:08:25,358
<i>How I do yearn for</i>

110
00:08:25,384 --> 00:08:27,651
<i>Hills and clouds so pretty</i>

111
00:08:28,651 --> 00:08:30,361
<i>Peaceful bedroom</i>

112
00:08:30,647 --> 00:08:32,720
<i>Window with a view</i>

113
00:08:32,736 --> 00:08:35,032
<i>Old dog that waits there</i>

114
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:36,809
<i>Where my dreams come true</i>

115
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:38,957
<i>Country roads</i>

116
00:08:39,141 --> 00:08:41,275
<i>I think I'll go</i>

117
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,501
<i>Down this path on my own</i>

118
00:08:46,034 --> 00:08:47,906
<i>West Virginia</i>

119
00:08:48,183 --> 00:08:49,862
<i>Mountain mama</i>

120
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:52,745
<i>Please take me home</i>

121
00:08:52,915 --> 00:08:55,076
<i>Down country roads</i>

122
00:08:55,138 --> 00:08:56,228
Hey, it's not bad.

123
00:08:56,506 --> 00:08:57,491
Yes, it is.

124
00:08:58,158 --> 00:08:59,301
It's boring.

125
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:00,302
Keep up! Come on!

126
00:09:00,318 --> 00:09:01,028
I don't think so.

127
00:09:01,044 --> 00:09:02,009
Wait for me!

128
00:09:02,685 --> 00:09:03,956
So I wrote another one.

129
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:07,435
<i>Concrete roads</i>

130
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,557
<i>Everywhere I go</i>

131
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,090
<i>Covering</i>

132
00:09:12,456 --> 00:09:14,518
<i>West Tokyo</i>

133
00:09:15,038 --> 00:09:17,246
<i>Chopped down forests</i>

134
00:09:17,396 --> 00:09:19,431
<i>Buried our valleys</i>

135
00:09:19,902 --> 00:09:21,937
<i>My hometown's</i>

136
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,169
<i>Down concrete road</i>

137
00:09:25,702 --> 00:09:26,815
Let's sing that!

138
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,341
Hey, so, why did you want to talk?

139
00:09:31,727 --> 00:09:33,012
Is there something bothering you?

140
00:09:33,248 --> 00:09:36,593
Mm... Do you think about boys?

141
00:09:37,227 --> 00:09:37,981
No.

142
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,019
We're all studying for exams and we could help each other.

143
00:09:41,244 --> 00:09:43,823
It would be nice to be with someone
who felt the same way about you.

144
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:46,938
Yuko, you have a crush on someone.

145
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,141
You got a love letter?!

146
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,455
Ah! Sh! Not so loud.

147
00:09:52,471 --> 00:09:54,501
So, what's he like? Is he good-looking?

148
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:56,067
He's from another class.

149
00:09:56,475 --> 00:09:58,069
Uh, he's sort of good-looking.

150
00:09:58,116 --> 00:09:59,233
Why not try dating him?

151
00:09:59,503 --> 00:10:00,969
If you don't like him, you can stop.

152
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:02,381
Yeah, but...

153
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:07,015
You've got a crush on someone else, don't you?

154
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:12,018
Don't even try to hide it.
You know I'll get it out of you.

155
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:15,446
It's, uh... Su... Su...

156
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:17,199
Shizuku!

157
00:10:18,628 --> 00:10:20,107
Can you throw me my bag?

158
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,981
Sugimura.

159
00:10:22,063 --> 00:10:24,559
It's that blue one, on the bench over there.

160
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:29,268
Come on! Hurry it up! I got to get back to the game!

161
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,108
Calm down, bench-warmer. You never play anyway.

162
00:10:33,478 --> 00:10:35,165
Hey, I play all the time,

163
00:10:35,206 --> 00:10:37,262
and our team's going to the playoffs, I'll have you know.

164
00:10:37,287 --> 00:10:37,961
Yuko?

165
00:10:48,219 --> 00:10:49,195
Are you OK?

166
00:10:49,814 --> 00:10:52,599
So I guess Sugimura is the guy you like.

167
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,554
How embarrassing. I ran off like a little girl.

168
00:10:56,894 --> 00:10:57,964
He must know now.

169
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,529
No way, Yuko. He's way too dense.

170
00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:03,475
But what about the guy who wrote you the love letter?

171
00:11:03,787 --> 00:11:04,972
I think you should go for him.

172
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:09,625
Hm... I don't know. I want to think it over.

173
00:11:10,731 --> 00:11:11,120
All right.

174
00:11:12,977 --> 00:11:14,185
You're lucky, Shizuku.

175
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:16,354
Your parents don't bug you to study all the time.

176
00:11:17,074 --> 00:11:18,716
Sometimes I wish they did.

177
00:11:19,187 --> 00:11:20,217
Hm, yeah.

178
00:11:21,494 --> 00:11:22,219
Oh, no!

179
00:11:22,234 --> 00:11:23,048
What's the matter?

180
00:11:23,064 --> 00:11:25,238
I lost my book. I must have dropped it.

181
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:26,534
You want to ride my bike?

182
00:11:26,549 --> 00:11:27,113
No!

183
00:11:27,383 --> 00:11:28,968
You'll be late for cram school.

184
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:30,585
Call me later, OK?

185
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,498
I will!

186
00:12:10,414 --> 00:12:11,835
You've got my book.

187
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,242
Oh. This is yours, is it?

188
00:12:20,245 --> 00:12:23,026
Here you go, Shizuku Tsukishima.

189
00:12:23,228 --> 00:12:24,432
What? How do you know my name?

190
00:12:25,713 --> 00:12:27,126
Gee, take a wild guess.

191
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,883
Oh, the checkout card.

192
00:12:30,946 --> 00:12:32,326
By the way, great lyrics.

193
00:12:32,342 --> 00:12:34,339
They're even cornier than the original version.

194
00:12:40,904 --> 00:12:42,109
You read this?!

195
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,392
Stupid jerk, stupid jerk, stupid jerk.

196
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,070
Stupid jerk, stupid jerk, stupid jerk!

197
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,574
Stupid jerk!

198
00:13:05,088 --> 00:13:07,393
"It's even cornier than the original version."

199
00:13:08,962 --> 00:13:10,099
Stupid jerk!

200
00:13:28,637 --> 00:13:29,387
Come on!

201
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:29,985
Stop!

202
00:13:48,852 --> 00:13:49,930
Hey, I'm home!

203
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:54,158
Oh, hey, sis. You're back early.

204
00:13:54,174 --> 00:13:56,031
Ah... I'm beat.

205
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:00,433
I grabbed a ride with someone who's going back to Tokyo.

206
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,366
Where's Mom?

207
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:06,789
She's at an intensive summer
course. And Dad's still at work.

208
00:14:07,815 --> 00:14:09,593
You need to clean up this room, Shizuku,

209
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:11,739
and you should have started dinner by now.

210
00:14:11,874 --> 00:14:13,172
I was just getting to it.

211
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:15,229
Ugh! This kitchen is a disaster!

212
00:14:15,253 --> 00:14:16,752
Have you cleaned anything since I left?

213
00:14:16,776 --> 00:14:18,547
Relax, I'll do it now.

214
00:14:21,731 --> 00:14:24,597
You need to stay on top of this
while Mom's got classes, Shizuku.

215
00:14:30,331 --> 00:14:32,310
After you wash the rice, finish up the laundry.

216
00:14:32,419 --> 00:14:34,669
I'll help you make dinner after I take a shower.

217
00:14:36,568 --> 00:14:39,230
Auntie said you should come visit
her after you finish your exams.

218
00:14:39,582 --> 00:14:40,127
Hm...

219
00:14:41,288 --> 00:14:42,283
Are you studying? - Uh-huh.

220
00:14:43,272 --> 00:14:47,588
You're gonna have big problems if you slack off
just because Dad and Mom don't bug you about it.

221
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:49,326
I'm studying, OK?

222
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:54,105
You know, she tried to get me to
bring home some of her soy sauce.

223
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:55,526
That's your aunt, all right.

224
00:14:56,743 --> 00:14:58,274
Didn't the same thing happen last year?

225
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,971
Yeah. She made me take home some miso. Really heavy.

226
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:02,530
It must have been five pounds.

227
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,874
Too bad Shizuku couldn't go visit her with you.

228
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:06,278
Yeah. Next year.

229
00:15:19,036 --> 00:15:21,179
Shizuku, come on, get up.

230
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,340
Vacuum your side of the room.

231
00:15:23,808 --> 00:15:25,945
Then strip the bed, 'cause I'm washing the sheets.

232
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:27,694
I'm doing the futons, too.

233
00:15:29,655 --> 00:15:30,869
Hey, where's Mom?

234
00:15:30,884 --> 00:15:32,443
She left hours ago.

235
00:15:36,546 --> 00:15:39,757
Clear the table when you're done, then
take Dad's lunch to him at the library.

236
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:40,598
Hey!

237
00:15:40,955 --> 00:15:42,359
What do you mean "Hey"?

238
00:15:42,582 --> 00:15:44,196
You're going to the library already.

239
00:15:45,364 --> 00:15:47,438
Or do you want me to go instead?

240
00:15:47,773 --> 00:15:50,512
Then you can clean the toilet,
the bathroom, and the entryway.

241
00:15:50,818 --> 00:15:55,105
Then you can go to the grocery store, fold
the laundry, make the beds and cook dinner.

242
00:15:55,226 --> 00:15:56,480
How does that sound?

243
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,811
See you later! Phew!

244
00:16:08,337 --> 00:16:09,372
Shizuku!

245
00:16:10,747 --> 00:16:12,400
Put this in the mailbox for me.

246
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,828
What is it?

247
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:16,706
Uh, it's mail, stupid.

248
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:23,738
You don't need to read it.

249
00:16:24,349 --> 00:16:26,455
Can't you just put it in the mailbox?

250
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:28,870
It's a love letter, isn't it?

251
00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:29,806
Shut up!

252
00:16:30,721 --> 00:16:31,158
Morning.

253
00:16:31,173 --> 00:16:32,215
Hey, how you doing?

254
00:16:34,415 --> 00:16:36,243
I don't know how I'm gonna pass this.

255
00:16:36,276 --> 00:16:38,506
Ah. Well, what you getta do is read some books.

256
00:17:04,035 --> 00:17:05,574
Next stop Suginomiya Station.

257
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:07,630
Suginomiya Station.

258
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:27,962
Hey there, cat. You all alone?

259
00:17:32,941 --> 00:17:34,004
So, where are you headed?

260
00:17:37,609 --> 00:17:38,739
See something interesting?

261
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:43,244
Oh, the silent treatment.

262
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:58,064
This is my stop. How about you?

263
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:03,698
So long, snotty.

264
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:12,121
Hey!

265
00:18:29,486 --> 00:18:30,647
I'll call you when I get there.

266
00:18:30,662 --> 00:18:31,708
Drop by the tailor's.

267
00:18:33,384 --> 00:18:34,615
Should get to a doctor...

268
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:40,525
He's headed towards the library.

269
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:04,464
I'll call you later, all right?

270
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,259
I finally thought I was gonna
get a little adventure around here.

271
00:19:44,753 --> 00:19:45,427
Hey!

272
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:22,403
Oh!

273
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:41,396
What a steep climb.

274
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,928
How far does this thing go?

275
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,598
Here, kitty.

276
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:07,003
Here, kitty.

277
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:13,667
He must live around here somewhere.

278
00:21:32,061 --> 00:21:32,516
Hey!

279
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,951
Where are you going, you crazy cat?

280
00:21:48,456 --> 00:21:49,768
Do you live around here?

281
00:22:09,575 --> 00:22:10,970
What a gorgeous neighborhood.

282
00:22:10,986 --> 00:22:12,962
I never knew there was a place like this up here.

283
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:33,603
No way.

284
00:22:33,848 --> 00:22:36,285
He came all this way just to tease that dog?

285
00:22:48,482 --> 00:22:51,609
Hm... I wonder if that cat isn't messing with me, too.

286
00:22:56,563 --> 00:22:59,035
An antique shop? He's going shopping now?

287
00:23:43,586 --> 00:23:47,378
Incredible. I had no idea there
were stores like this around here.

288
00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:18,060
What a fantastic statue.

289
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:28,206
You're not the cat I was following, are you?

290
00:24:40,634 --> 00:24:42,015
Oh, hello there.

291
00:24:42,109 --> 00:24:42,886
I'm sorry.

292
00:24:43,134 --> 00:24:45,126
No, please, it's good to have visitors.

293
00:24:45,142 --> 00:24:46,767
Look around as much as you like.

294
00:24:46,965 --> 00:24:48,556
The Baron is bored, too.

295
00:24:50,647 --> 00:24:53,339
The Baron? Is that the name of the statue over here?

296
00:24:53,355 --> 00:24:55,619
Yeah. Baron Humbert von Joekkingen.

297
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,197
Good name, don't you think?

298
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,172
Oh, thanks.

299
00:25:09,862 --> 00:25:11,952
Don't worry, though. I do this all the time.

300
00:25:12,066 --> 00:25:13,280
Great clock.

301
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:17,298
It was found in an abandoned
castle, all covered with rust.

302
00:25:17,525 --> 00:25:18,379
Look at this.

303
00:25:22,683 --> 00:25:23,494
Beautiful.

304
00:25:24,177 --> 00:25:25,514
So what does it do?

305
00:25:28,406 --> 00:25:30,024
It might not do anything.

306
00:25:30,773 --> 00:25:32,751
I just finished restoring this.

307
00:25:33,434 --> 00:25:35,032
I haven't tried it out yet.

308
00:26:10,891 --> 00:26:13,048
Dwarves in a jewel mine, just like a fairy tale.

309
00:26:13,149 --> 00:26:14,509
You like fairy tales.

310
00:26:14,831 --> 00:26:18,187
This clock has a terribly romantic
fairy tale that goes with it.

311
00:26:20,231 --> 00:26:22,209
Watch what happens on the clock face.

312
00:26:22,613 --> 00:26:24,471
At least I hope something happens.

313
00:26:42,716 --> 00:26:43,579
What is that?

314
00:26:43,632 --> 00:26:46,290
Stand up here on the ladder, then you can see better.

315
00:26:47,025 --> 00:26:47,552
OK.

316
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,590
Oh, it's a fairy.

317
00:26:53,705 --> 00:26:57,342
She is now, but soon she'll turn back into a sheep.

318
00:27:04,114 --> 00:27:05,955
The two of them are in love, aren't they?

319
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:08,974
Mm-hm. But they are always apart.

320
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:11,409
He's king of the Dwarves and lives underground,

321
00:27:11,575 --> 00:27:13,970
while she's cursed to live as a sheep.

322
00:27:14,371 --> 00:27:16,999
Only while the clock strikes twelve is she a fairy.

323
00:27:17,015 --> 00:27:19,156
So the king appears at that moment

324
00:27:19,486 --> 00:27:22,278
just to catch a glimpse of the girl he fell in love with.

325
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:28,435
What do you bet that the artisan who made this
clock was separated from the love of his life?

326
00:27:30,343 --> 00:27:32,782
That must be why their sadness feels so real.

327
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:35,960
Ah!

328
00:27:36,976 --> 00:27:38,789
That clock isn't on time, is it?

329
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,117
No. It's about five minutes too slow.

330
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:42,181
Oh, no!

331
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:43,364
Whoa!

332
00:27:43,786 --> 00:27:45,836
I've got to get to the... library!

333
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:49,268
I'm sorry, do you mind if I come again later?

334
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:52,882
Sure. But it's better to go left to get to the library.

335
00:28:05,171 --> 00:28:07,296
Oh, good! I'm right above the library.

336
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,775
What a great place that was.

337
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:15,731
It was like straight out of a fairy tale.

338
00:28:17,661 --> 00:28:18,972
That was amazing!

339
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,969
Shizuku Tsukishima!

340
00:28:26,688 --> 00:28:28,170
Hey, this is yours, isn't it?

341
00:28:28,713 --> 00:28:29,991
Huh? Ah!

342
00:28:30,704 --> 00:28:31,127
Uh...

343
00:28:33,894 --> 00:28:35,312
You're kind of forgetful, aren't you?

344
00:28:35,402 --> 00:28:37,722
Uh, thanks, but how did you get this?

345
00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:38,984
Take a wild guess.

346
00:28:41,899 --> 00:28:43,573
That man, do you know him?

347
00:28:43,685 --> 00:28:44,794
Is he your grandpa?

348
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:47,456
You must eat like a pig. That lunch is enormous.

349
00:28:47,521 --> 00:28:48,003
Huh?

350
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:50,712
Hey, you!

351
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:54,403
<i>Concrete roads Everywhere I go</i>

352
00:28:55,571 --> 00:28:57,988
It's my dad's, you jerk!

353
00:29:00,134 --> 00:29:01,999
Hey, thanks. You brought my lunch.

354
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:07,283
What's wrong? Why the sour face?

355
00:29:07,885 --> 00:29:09,063
It's hard to explain.

356
00:29:09,825 --> 00:29:10,413
And?

357
00:29:10,898 --> 00:29:14,324
I was having an extraordinary day,
like I was living in a fairy tale,

358
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,163
then some jerk talked to me for
two seconds and ruined everything.

359
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,539
Sounds complicated.

360
00:29:21,692 --> 00:29:23,291
Are you going to check out some books today?

361
00:29:23,307 --> 00:29:25,322
Yeah. I just have seven more to go.

362
00:29:25,768 --> 00:29:28,643
You never stop reading. You want
to take some time out for lunch?

363
00:29:28,694 --> 00:29:29,511
I'll eat later.

364
00:29:29,797 --> 00:29:31,758
OK, then. See you later.

365
00:29:54,353 --> 00:29:55,965
Seiji Amasawa.

366
00:29:56,647 --> 00:29:59,853
Wow. Is there any book here this guy hasn't checked out?

367
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:03,102
I wonder what kind of person he is.

368
00:30:06,532 --> 00:30:08,340
No way! Not that jerk!

369
00:30:12,618 --> 00:30:13,298
Sh!

370
00:30:34,545 --> 00:30:35,238
Ah!

371
00:31:02,222 --> 00:31:03,961
Shizuku, hurry up!

372
00:31:05,932 --> 00:31:07,519
Oh! We're going to be late!

373
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,931
Hurry, get the umbrellas.

374
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:15,468
The first day of the semester and it has to rain.

375
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:17,741
Stop complaining.

376
00:31:17,885 --> 00:31:19,641
At least you're going to school because you want to.

377
00:31:19,923 --> 00:31:20,846
Yes, ma'am.

378
00:31:21,204 --> 00:31:22,117
Study hard.

379
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:23,657
You can count on me.

380
00:31:32,566 --> 00:31:33,501
Shizuku!

381
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,422
Hey, Yuko!

382
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:36,404
Hurry up! I don't want to be late for our first day.

383
00:31:37,311 --> 00:31:39,488
I can't believe how many tests we have to take.

384
00:31:40,061 --> 00:31:41,766
It's one thing or another every day.

385
00:31:47,028 --> 00:31:48,748
So, did you answer the letter? - Mm-mm.

386
00:31:49,548 --> 00:31:50,748
Have you made up your mind yet?

387
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:53,868
Yeah. I decided I don't want to go out with him.

388
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:57,291
OK. Yeah, maybe that's best.

389
00:31:57,643 --> 00:31:59,215
Sugimura!

390
00:32:00,844 --> 00:32:02,012
You're gonna be late!

391
00:32:02,329 --> 00:32:03,799
Calm down, we know!

392
00:32:13,488 --> 00:32:15,567
OK, everybody, pencils down.

393
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:23,101
Regular classes this afternoon.

394
00:32:23,117 --> 00:32:24,410
Hey, Jun, Daizo.

395
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,410
Let's eat fast so we can get outside.

396
00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:30,095
Let's eat lunch in Miss Kosaka's office, OK?

397
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,979
Can we stop by the teachers' lounge first?

398
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:32,990
I guess so.

399
00:32:33,005 --> 00:32:34,793
Hey, Shizuku, check it out!

400
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:35,087
What?

401
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:37,568
I totally aced that test.

402
00:32:37,694 --> 00:32:38,946
Well, good for you.

403
00:32:39,287 --> 00:32:42,147
Everything I studied was on the test and I barely studied.

404
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,380
So you're not just a bench-warmer after all.

405
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,969
Yuko's good at guessing what's on tests.

406
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,806
You should study with her sometime.

407
00:32:49,138 --> 00:32:50,323
Study with her?

408
00:32:50,347 --> 00:32:51,807
Sugimura, Sugimura!

409
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:52,499
What's up?

410
00:32:52,729 --> 00:32:53,700
Did you see this?

411
00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:54,906
Let's go, Shizuku.

412
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:02,503
I can't believe you said that, Shizuku.

413
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:03,607
What's the problem?

414
00:33:03,623 --> 00:33:06,163
I've never been good at guessing what's on tests.

415
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:07,005
Sorry.

416
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:09,690
Excuse us.

417
00:33:13,287 --> 00:33:14,875
You want to know who donated a book?

418
00:33:14,891 --> 00:33:16,884
I don't think I'd remember something like that.

419
00:33:17,018 --> 00:33:18,943
I hate to interrupt you while you're eating, but

420
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:20,546
if you could look at this stamp here.

421
00:33:20,562 --> 00:33:22,228
Hm? Well...

422
00:33:22,739 --> 00:33:23,490
Let's see.

423
00:33:26,372 --> 00:33:30,793
Oh, Dr. Amasawa, sure. I've read
this book, too. It's quite a good one.

424
00:33:31,152 --> 00:33:32,373
Yes, it's great.

425
00:33:32,515 --> 00:33:35,576
So, is there anything that you
can tell me about Dr. Amasawa?

426
00:33:35,631 --> 00:33:37,362
Let me see if I can remember.

427
00:33:37,378 --> 00:33:39,604
I think he was chairman of the PTA.

428
00:33:39,747 --> 00:33:40,840
The PTA, huh?

429
00:33:41,138 --> 00:33:43,655
Would you happen to remember Dr. Amasawa's first name?

430
00:33:43,671 --> 00:33:45,810
First name? Let's see.

431
00:33:45,989 --> 00:33:49,633
Mr. Kimura, do you happen to
remember Dr. Amasawa's first name?

432
00:33:49,658 --> 00:33:53,355
Dr. Amasawa. I'm pretty sure it's Koichi. Koichi Amasawa.

433
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:55,247
Koichi Amasawa.

434
00:33:55,681 --> 00:33:58,680
Shizuku, Dr. Amasawa's son goes to school here.

435
00:33:58,805 --> 00:34:01,209
There's a chance you could
have met him. He's in your grade.

436
00:34:01,321 --> 00:34:02,751
Huh? Uh...

437
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,896
...I gotta go. Thank you very much!

438
00:34:06,541 --> 00:34:07,565
Uh, excuse us.

439
00:34:08,785 --> 00:34:09,917
Oh! Excuse me.

440
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:14,677
Shizuku! What's wrong with you?

441
00:34:16,947 --> 00:34:18,108
It can't be him.

442
00:34:18,735 --> 00:34:23,042
What in the world are you talking
about? You are acting like a total weirdo.

443
00:34:24,266 --> 00:34:25,265
I'm sorry.

444
00:34:35,465 --> 00:34:37,199
Shizuku, now what are you doing?

445
00:34:54,163 --> 00:34:56,538
What a complete jerk! Do you know what that guy's name is?

446
00:34:56,591 --> 00:34:58,936
No. He's not in our class. What's the big deal?

447
00:34:58,984 --> 00:35:01,700
That jerk better not be Dr. Amasawa's son.

448
00:35:03,319 --> 00:35:05,672
Shizuku chasing down boys? I don't believe it.

449
00:35:05,862 --> 00:35:08,532
I had to run after her, carrying her lunchbox.

450
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:12,473
So Shizuku has a crush on someone, eh?

451
00:35:12,682 --> 00:35:16,784
Miss Kosaka, can you believe she's finally
interested in something other than a book?

452
00:35:16,905 --> 00:35:18,829
I'm not interested. He's a jerk!

453
00:35:18,901 --> 00:35:20,883
What if he checked out those books?

454
00:35:20,899 --> 00:35:21,888
He's your perfect match.

455
00:35:21,903 --> 00:35:23,078
Like a fairy tale.

456
00:35:23,152 --> 00:35:25,850
If it's him, it's not a fairy tale, it's a horror story.

457
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:29,727
So, tell us, what's the name of this guy
who checked out all the books, huh, Yuko?

458
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:31,999
Yuko.

459
00:35:32,014 --> 00:35:33,403
I can't remember exactly.

460
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:36,550
There was a "ma" in it, or maybe it was a "wa."

461
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:39,651
Ama... Just say it, Shizuku!

462
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:40,460
No way.

463
00:35:40,515 --> 00:35:45,714
Shizuku is such a great storyteller, but now that
the story is about her, she won't say a single word.

464
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:48,140
You can't hide the fact that you're in love, Shizuku.

465
00:35:49,286 --> 00:35:52,144
The look on your face shows
your heart suffers with every beat.

466
00:35:52,529 --> 00:35:55,931
How romantic. You are in love.

467
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:58,650
Go ahead, make fun of me if you want to.

468
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:02,001
Too bad. I was gonna show you
my lyrics for "Country Roads."

469
00:36:02,121 --> 00:36:03,932
You're finished? - Let me see! Let me see!

470
00:36:06,094 --> 00:36:10,104
Great Shizuku, master of writing,
we shall make fun of you no more.

471
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,575
Please grace us with your words.

472
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,344
That's better.

473
00:36:14,042 --> 00:36:15,460
I don't know if it's any good, though.

474
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:19,599
And it might not be appropriate for graduation.

475
00:36:20,115 --> 00:36:22,054
I just tried to write something from the heart.

476
00:36:22,502 --> 00:36:24,247
This is so good, Shizuku.

477
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,431
<i>Country roads</i>

478
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:30,009
<i>I think I'll go</i>

479
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:35,208
<i>Down this path on my own</i>

480
00:36:35,324 --> 00:36:37,640
<i>My inspiration</i>

481
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:40,478
<i>The road less taken</i>

482
00:36:40,858 --> 00:36:42,960
<i>But this is my</i>

483
00:36:43,162 --> 00:36:45,164
<i>Country road</i>

484
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,208
It's great, Shizuku. I love it!

485
00:36:48,891 --> 00:36:50,263
The lyrics aren't too corny?

486
00:36:50,351 --> 00:36:53,426
No. They're wonderful. You really have a gift for writing.

487
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,840
Reading all those books actually did her some good.

488
00:36:55,987 --> 00:36:57,334
You sure they're OK?

489
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:58,556
They're from the heart.

490
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,091
Yeah. I really like this part:

491
00:37:01,331 --> 00:37:03,542
"I dreamed of living alone but fearless.

492
00:37:03,558 --> 00:37:05,644
Secret longing to be courageous.

493
00:37:05,859 --> 00:37:07,836
Loneliness kept bottled up inside..."

494
00:37:08,104 --> 00:37:09,799
Ladies, that's the bell.

495
00:37:10,227 --> 00:37:11,148
Yes, ma'am.

496
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:20,245
Ah! I love being a writer!

497
00:37:20,808 --> 00:37:21,907
Shizuku!

498
00:37:22,026 --> 00:37:24,028
Do you want to come with us to the glee club?

499
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,466
We're gonna show them your lyrics.

500
00:37:25,481 --> 00:37:26,498
No, thanks.

501
00:37:26,601 --> 00:37:28,451
I want to check out some books from the library.

502
00:37:28,574 --> 00:37:30,743
More books? We've got a test tomorrow, you know.

503
00:37:31,232 --> 00:37:32,472
I'll study when I get home.

504
00:37:32,939 --> 00:37:33,820
Yeah, right.

505
00:37:34,513 --> 00:37:35,367
See you later.

506
00:37:35,392 --> 00:37:36,139
See ya!

507
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,071
Hey, Yuko.

508
00:38:15,172 --> 00:38:18,992
Uh, sorry to bother you, but, uh, can we talk?

509
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:21,576
Mm-hm.

510
00:38:29,536 --> 00:38:31,563
I was afraid it would be closed.

511
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:33,840
I hope that old man's doing all right.

512
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:48,502
The Baron's gone.

513
00:38:49,082 --> 00:38:50,171
Someone must have bought him.

514
00:38:57,481 --> 00:38:59,235
"Mr. Nishi's Antique Shop."

515
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,457
Oh, thank goodness.

516
00:39:01,523 --> 00:39:03,912
That jerk's name isn't Amasawa. It's Nishi.

517
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,710
Shizuku!

518
00:39:20,204 --> 00:39:22,028
Shizuku, Yuko's on the phone.

519
00:39:24,589 --> 00:39:25,396
Hey!

520
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,066
Phone call. Can't you hear anything?

521
00:39:28,641 --> 00:39:30,505
I keep telling you you're gonna ruin your hearing.

522
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:33,567
Hello? What?

523
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,438
I can't really hear you.

524
00:39:36,586 --> 00:39:39,130
Mm-hm. Don't worry about it, Yuko.

525
00:39:39,297 --> 00:39:40,825
Mm-hm. I'll be right there.

526
00:39:41,654 --> 00:39:42,621
Where are you going?

527
00:39:42,636 --> 00:39:43,565
Just down the street.

528
00:39:50,949 --> 00:39:52,354
Yuko, what happened?

529
00:39:53,164 --> 00:39:54,283
Shizuku.

530
00:39:54,933 --> 00:39:57,722
What is it? Why... Why are you crying?

531
00:39:58,309 --> 00:39:59,885
I talked to Sugimura,

532
00:40:00,052 --> 00:40:02,338
and he's friends with the guy who wrote me that letter,

533
00:40:02,354 --> 00:40:05,418
so he tried to convince me to go out with his friend.

534
00:40:07,501 --> 00:40:08,253
Wha...?

535
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:13,552
Go out with your friend? How could you say that to me?!

536
00:40:16,126 --> 00:40:16,739
What?

537
00:40:19,765 --> 00:40:22,130
That jerk. I can't believe he's that stupid.

538
00:40:22,742 --> 00:40:24,077
But I don't think he did it to hurt you.

539
00:40:24,595 --> 00:40:26,635
He's just a dope. He has no idea that you like him.

540
00:40:28,868 --> 00:40:30,807
I better apologize to him, I guess.

541
00:40:31,052 --> 00:40:34,514
But there's no way I can go to
school with my face looking like this.

542
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:35,957
I'm going to have to stay home tomorrow.

543
00:40:36,187 --> 00:40:37,488
We've got tests, you know.

544
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:38,704
Mm-hm.

545
00:40:40,259 --> 00:40:40,833
OK.

546
00:41:00,641 --> 00:41:01,336
Idiot.

547
00:41:04,109 --> 00:41:04,944
What did I do?

548
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,597
That was pretty easy, huh?

549
00:41:09,352 --> 00:41:10,768
Headed to the library again?

550
00:41:10,783 --> 00:41:12,333
No. I'm gonna go check on Yuko.

551
00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:13,865
Oh, tell her I hope she feels better.

552
00:41:13,881 --> 00:41:15,135
I will. See ya.

553
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:15,715
Bye-bye.

554
00:41:23,104 --> 00:41:23,990
Shizuku!

555
00:41:26,064 --> 00:41:26,807
Wait up!

556
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,053
Whoa!

557
00:41:34,017 --> 00:41:35,598
I need to talk to you about Yuko.

558
00:41:42,863 --> 00:41:45,504
And then all of a sudden she starts crying her head off.

559
00:41:46,112 --> 00:41:48,250
So, what did I say that was so terrible, huh?

560
00:41:50,006 --> 00:41:50,998
Just think about it.

561
00:41:51,522 --> 00:41:53,624
Remember when Yuko said, "Date your friend?

562
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,953
How could you say that to me?"

563
00:41:55,056 --> 00:41:55,636
Mm-hm.

564
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,142
All I said was he's a good guy.

565
00:41:57,158 --> 00:41:58,507
She should give him a chance.

566
00:41:58,935 --> 00:42:00,002
Get a clue!

567
00:42:00,497 --> 00:42:03,400
What Yuko was saying was that she
didn't want to hear that from you.

568
00:42:03,698 --> 00:42:05,102
You know what that means, don't you?

569
00:42:05,363 --> 00:42:06,912
I don't speak girl code!

570
00:42:07,227 --> 00:42:08,637
Why don't you spell it out for me?

571
00:42:09,128 --> 00:42:11,198
Ah! I can't believe you're this dense!

572
00:42:11,444 --> 00:42:14,068
What it means is, Yuko has a crush on you.

573
00:42:14,317 --> 00:42:18,019
What? Are you sure? I didn't pick up on that.

574
00:42:18,224 --> 00:42:20,990
Are you blind? She stayed home from school, you know.

575
00:42:21,219 --> 00:42:23,446
She even missed a test on account of you.

576
00:42:23,692 --> 00:42:27,576
But, it's that... You're the one I'm in love with!

577
00:42:29,237 --> 00:42:32,036
What? Come on, quit joking around, will you?

578
00:42:32,178 --> 00:42:35,926
I'm not joking. I've been in love
with you for years. Haven't you noticed?

579
00:42:36,109 --> 00:42:39,884
But you can't fall for me. That just doesn't happen.

580
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,974
Don't you like me at all? Or
is there someone else you love?

581
00:42:43,606 --> 00:42:45,293
I'm not in love with anybody.

582
00:42:46,578 --> 00:42:49,274
But Yuko, she'll... I gotta go!

583
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:52,672
Wait a minute! Forget Yuko! Do you like me?

584
00:42:52,933 --> 00:42:55,190
Of course I like you. We've been friends for years.

585
00:42:55,338 --> 00:42:58,869
But Yuko and I are best friends, so
that's the way it's gonna stay, OK?

586
00:43:01,569 --> 00:43:04,481
You understand? Or do I have to spell it out some more?

587
00:43:10,609 --> 00:43:12,800
No. I understand.

588
00:43:13,707 --> 00:43:14,922
We'll just be friends.

589
00:43:22,412 --> 00:43:24,930
I'm sorry. I'll never mention it again.

590
00:44:11,845 --> 00:44:12,825
You idiot!

591
00:44:13,561 --> 00:44:15,384
You're the one who's dense.

592
00:44:24,597 --> 00:44:27,106
Oh, Mrs. Tsukishima, I've got a package for you.

593
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:28,652
The mailman left it with me.

594
00:44:28,701 --> 00:44:30,374
Oh, thanks. Sorry to trouble you.

595
00:44:44,652 --> 00:44:46,342
Thanks so much for these.

596
00:44:46,358 --> 00:44:48,764
No problem. There's way too much for us to eat.

597
00:44:50,134 --> 00:44:51,301
Oh, you're home.

598
00:44:52,187 --> 00:44:52,965
Shizuku?

599
00:46:14,866 --> 00:46:15,763
Hi, cat.

600
00:46:18,076 --> 00:46:19,831
Did you get locked out of your house?

601
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,434
So, what happened? Did everyone forget about you?

602
00:46:25,502 --> 00:46:26,861
Would you like some company?

603
00:46:30,339 --> 00:46:32,064
You're not very nice, are you, cat?

604
00:46:32,722 --> 00:46:33,802
Neither am I.

605
00:46:36,328 --> 00:46:38,898
I used to be nice and friendly and a grade-A student.

606
00:46:38,926 --> 00:46:41,912
Now I just goof around reading
books and writing stupid lyrics.

607
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:43,464
I don't know what's wrong.

608
00:46:43,489 --> 00:46:46,172
Even reading books isn't as much fun as it used to be.

609
00:46:46,434 --> 00:46:48,667
Now when I read, a little voice inside me says,

610
00:46:48,683 --> 00:46:51,535
"You know things never turn
out like they do in fairy tales."

611
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:52,889
I miss the old me.

612
00:47:19,129 --> 00:47:20,804
Shizuku Tsukishima.

613
00:47:21,327 --> 00:47:22,183
Hi.

614
00:47:22,368 --> 00:47:24,095
I'm surprised Moon lets you pet him.

615
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:26,743
You don't like anyone, do you, Moon?

616
00:47:26,957 --> 00:47:28,333
So Moon is his name?

617
00:47:28,672 --> 00:47:32,208
He looks like a full moon, doesn't
he? Especially from that angle.

618
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:34,418
But I've heard him called a few other names, too.

619
00:47:37,767 --> 00:47:39,542
What do you mean? Doesn't he belong to you?

620
00:47:39,736 --> 00:47:41,743
Nope. He doesn't belong to anybody.

621
00:47:41,874 --> 00:47:45,024
He just wanders around our neighborhood
and lives in different houses.

622
00:47:45,214 --> 00:47:47,218
I've heard our neighbors call him Muta.

623
00:47:47,876 --> 00:47:50,339
Hm. So he's a vagabond.

624
00:47:51,842 --> 00:47:54,895
That's right! I saw him riding
around on the train the other day.

625
00:47:55,596 --> 00:47:56,405
The train?

626
00:47:56,818 --> 00:47:57,279
Yeah.

627
00:47:57,382 --> 00:47:59,321
He was taking a trip all by himself,

628
00:47:59,405 --> 00:48:01,491
then he got off at my stop and I followed him here.

629
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,061
I was so excited when he led me to this store.

630
00:48:04,115 --> 00:48:06,310
It was like something straight out of a fairy tale.

631
00:48:09,082 --> 00:48:11,742
I guess I shouldn't have said those bad things about him.

632
00:48:12,451 --> 00:48:14,004
I said he was mean like me.

633
00:48:14,343 --> 00:48:17,226
What? Moon's not like you. He's not like you at all.

634
00:48:18,299 --> 00:48:21,154
I... I mean, the cat's really kind of crazy.

635
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:29,795
So, I...

636
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:33,774
Is your grandfather OK?

637
00:48:33,969 --> 00:48:36,791
His shop has been closed for
so long. I hope he's not sick.

638
00:48:36,876 --> 00:48:39,222
Yeah, he's fine. He just likes to keep weird hours.

639
00:48:39,295 --> 00:48:41,160
I think his store is closed more often than it's open.

640
00:48:41,176 --> 00:48:45,352
Oh, that's good to know. I peeked in the window
and saw The Baron is not sitting on the table anymore.

641
00:48:45,885 --> 00:48:46,762
Did somebody buy him?

642
00:48:47,301 --> 00:48:49,000
Oh, you mean that cat statue?

643
00:48:49,175 --> 00:48:50,718
Wanna see him? Come on.

644
00:49:01,323 --> 00:49:02,426
Can you close the door?

645
00:49:19,282 --> 00:49:19,764
This way.

646
00:49:22,782 --> 00:49:24,725
Wow. It's almost like we're in the sky.

647
00:49:31,971 --> 00:49:34,066
You're not afraid of heights, are you, Shizuku?

648
00:49:35,273 --> 00:49:37,936
No. I love it up here. It's inspiring.

649
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:47,319
From the balcony, this time of
day is the prettiest. Come on.

650
00:50:11,535 --> 00:50:12,305
Here we are.

651
00:50:13,206 --> 00:50:14,242
You can sit if you like.

652
00:50:14,646 --> 00:50:16,002
Hey, the clock is gone.

653
00:50:16,924 --> 00:50:20,467
Oh, the big grandfather clock. We delivered it today.

654
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:21,716
Here, have a look.

655
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:23,662
So who bought the clock?

656
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:26,219
No one. It was just here for a repair job.

657
00:50:26,577 --> 00:50:29,437
I see. Too bad. It was beautiful.

658
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,591
It took Grandpa three years to fix it.

659
00:50:31,657 --> 00:50:33,291
He finished it the day you left your lunch here.

660
00:50:33,635 --> 00:50:35,064
Hey, about that lunch...

661
00:50:35,118 --> 00:50:37,230
I know it wasn't yours, and you don't eat like a pig.

662
00:50:37,933 --> 00:50:39,995
Now come over here and have a look into The Baron's eyes.

663
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:44,476
Hurry up. The sun's starting to set.

664
00:50:50,682 --> 00:50:51,308
Wow.

665
00:50:57,255 --> 00:50:59,956
Pretty cool, huh? It's actually an accident.

666
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,951
Sometimes the eyes get flawed when they're
installed, then they refract the light like that.

667
00:51:04,264 --> 00:51:05,470
That's amazing.

668
00:51:05,903 --> 00:51:09,123
Grandpa will never sell The
Baron. He wants to find its partner.

669
00:51:09,809 --> 00:51:10,705
There's another one?

670
00:51:11,952 --> 00:51:12,432
Yeah.

671
00:51:12,448 --> 00:51:15,440
He says that her name is Louise, but that's about it.

672
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:19,268
Look as long as you like. I'm going downstairs.

673
00:51:23,196 --> 00:51:24,744
The light switch is over there if you need it.

674
00:51:38,786 --> 00:51:41,586
So, Baron, let's hear about this Louise.

675
00:51:41,602 --> 00:51:43,383
Is she an old girlfriend of yours or something?

676
00:51:43,841 --> 00:51:46,329
You look like you're all dressed up for a wedding.

677
00:51:46,572 --> 00:51:49,578
Did she leave you at the altar? Did someone kidnap her?

678
00:51:50,654 --> 00:51:53,709
There's a sad story there. I'll
have to figure it out for myself.

679
00:52:56,702 --> 00:52:57,863
Hey. Had enough?

680
00:52:58,274 --> 00:52:59,482
Mm-hm. Thank you.

681
00:53:00,148 --> 00:53:03,084
So, is that a real violin you're making?

682
00:53:03,631 --> 00:53:05,002
Oh, yeah.

683
00:53:06,571 --> 00:53:07,330
Can I see?

684
00:53:07,904 --> 00:53:08,449
Sure.

685
00:53:12,469 --> 00:53:13,735
It's nearly finished.

686
00:53:14,135 --> 00:53:14,874
Wow!

687
00:53:15,324 --> 00:53:18,086
You carved the entire thing yourself, by hand?

688
00:53:18,391 --> 00:53:19,486
How else would you do it?

689
00:53:19,993 --> 00:53:21,256
That is amazing.

690
00:53:21,607 --> 00:53:24,939
They've been making violins
the exact same way for 300 years,

691
00:53:25,057 --> 00:53:28,105
but whether or not they sound any good
is dependent on the craftsman's skill.

692
00:53:29,613 --> 00:53:31,648
Did you make all those violins?

693
00:53:32,132 --> 00:53:33,158
No, of course not.

694
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,238
We hold violin-making classes here.

695
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:37,740
But one of them's yours, isn't it?

696
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,035
Yeah.

697
00:53:39,885 --> 00:53:41,060
So which one is it?

698
00:53:41,641 --> 00:53:42,165
The end.

699
00:53:43,133 --> 00:53:43,855
Wow.

700
00:53:44,195 --> 00:53:45,654
That's really fantastic.

701
00:53:45,685 --> 00:53:48,072
I can't believe you can make something like this.

702
00:53:48,365 --> 00:53:49,638
It's like magic, isn't it?

703
00:53:50,439 --> 00:53:51,503
You're so weird.

704
00:53:51,924 --> 00:53:54,483
I can't believe some of the
stuff that comes out of your mouth.

705
00:53:54,705 --> 00:53:57,815
It is magic. You made a violin pop out of a piece of wood.

706
00:53:57,922 --> 00:54:00,061
Anyone can make a violin of that caliber.

707
00:54:01,992 --> 00:54:03,547
I'm not close to being good enough.

708
00:54:10,543 --> 00:54:12,574
So, can you play the violin?

709
00:54:13,121 --> 00:54:13,828
Sort of.

710
00:54:14,135 --> 00:54:16,474
Would you play something for me, just a little bit?

711
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:17,845
Give me a break.

712
00:54:17,861 --> 00:54:20,508
Come on, come on. Won't you, please?

713
00:54:20,695 --> 00:54:23,095
All right, but you're gonna have to sing along.

714
00:54:23,139 --> 00:54:23,520
What?

715
00:54:24,925 --> 00:54:27,185
You don't want me to sing. I'm terrible.

716
00:54:27,443 --> 00:54:29,374
I've got just the song for you.

717
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:47,348
Are you ready? I'm pretty sure you know this one.

718
00:55:11,755 --> 00:55:14,310
<i>I dreamed of living</i>

719
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:17,193
<i>Alone but fearless</i>

720
00:55:17,499 --> 00:55:19,739
<i>Secret longing</i>

721
00:55:19,798 --> 00:55:22,834
<i>To be courageous</i>

722
00:55:23,011 --> 00:55:25,145
<i>Loneliness kept</i>

723
00:55:25,201 --> 00:55:27,453
<i>Bottled up inside</i>

724
00:55:27,917 --> 00:55:30,479
<i>Just reveal your brave face</i>

725
00:55:30,495 --> 00:55:32,581
<i>They'll never know you lied</i>

726
00:55:32,666 --> 00:55:35,211

00:55:35,377 --> 00:55:37,880

00:55:40,863 --> 00:55:43,616

00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:52,038
<i>Know I can't go</i>

733
00:55:52,296 --> 00:55:54,840
<i>Country road</i>

734
00:55:56,224 --> 00:55:58,597
<i>No matter how dark</i>

735
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:01,020
<i>The world's inside me</i>

736
00:56:01,063 --> 00:56:05,571
<i>I'll never stop to show a tear that I've shed</i>

737
00:56:06,645 --> 00:56:09,650
<i>But now I have to walk so fast</i>

738
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:12,292
<i>Running, sprinting to forget</i>

739
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:16,982
<i>What is lodged in my head</i>

740
00:56:17,086 --> 00:56:19,588

00:56:19,755 --> 00:56:22,550

00:56:36,772 --> 00:56:39,164

00:56:39,608 --> 00:56:42,015

749
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,613

750
00:56:45,217 --> 00:56:50,339

751
00:56:50,661 --> 00:56:53,296

00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:56,001

<i>Country road</i>

755
00:57:37,116 --> 00:57:39,015
That was wonderful, you two.

756
00:57:41,479 --> 00:57:44,446
I'm Shizuku, by the way. Thanks
for the great accompaniment.

757
00:57:47,303 --> 00:57:48,712
You're welcome, Shizuku.

758
00:57:48,728 --> 00:57:50,815
I was hoping we would meet up again.

759
00:57:51,498 --> 00:57:53,984
These are my good friends, Kita and Minami.

760
00:57:54,566 --> 00:57:55,899
Nice vocals.

761
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:59,806
You're the lucky girl who got to see the
grandfather clock strike twelve. Isn't it right?

762
00:58:00,497 --> 00:58:03,301
I never knew you had such a pretty friend, Seiji.

763
00:58:03,816 --> 00:58:05,772
What? Seiji?

764
00:58:05,861 --> 00:58:08,179
Is your name Seiji Amasawa?

765
00:58:08,465 --> 00:58:09,862
Yeah. Of course.

766
00:58:10,254 --> 00:58:13,290
Wait, didn't I tell you my name? - No, you didn't.

767
00:58:13,465 --> 00:58:15,809
I thought it was Nishi. That's what's on the sign.

768
00:58:16,356 --> 00:58:19,484
That's my grandfather's last name. Mine is Amasawa.

769
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:23,064
This is my worst nightmare. I should have known better.

770
00:58:23,379 --> 00:58:25,035
I never get the fairy tale ending.

771
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:26,909
What are you babbling about?

772
00:58:26,996 --> 00:58:28,792
What difference does it make what my name is?

773
00:58:28,817 --> 00:58:32,393
It makes a difference! You knew
my name but you never told me yours.

774
00:58:32,637 --> 00:58:34,707
You could've asked me my name if it was such a big deal.

775
00:58:34,723 --> 00:58:37,022
I never had a chance! This is so unfair!

776
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:40,032
Oh! I was so sure Seiji Amasawa was...

777
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:41,296
I was what?

778
00:58:41,399 --> 00:58:43,641
A nice, intelligent, civilized person.

779
00:58:43,823 --> 00:58:45,977
Oh, really? You read too many fairy tales.

780
00:58:45,993 --> 00:58:47,995
Clearly you've read a lot of them yourself.

781
00:59:03,987 --> 00:59:07,283
Your grandpa and his friends are
really nice. I had a great time.

782
00:59:07,402 --> 00:59:10,068
You'll have to come back sometime.
Grandpa and his friends would like that.

783
00:59:10,292 --> 00:59:13,087
Next time I'm keeping my mouth
shut. No yelling or singing.

784
00:59:13,897 --> 00:59:16,457
But I could listen to you play violin for hours.

785
00:59:16,565 --> 00:59:17,868
Have you ever thought of performing?

786
00:59:18,323 --> 00:59:20,720
No, my violin playing's nothing special.

787
00:59:20,936 --> 00:59:23,814
My ultimate goal in life is to
be a world-class violin maker.

788
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,719
That's great. You're already so good at it.

789
00:59:27,428 --> 00:59:30,832
No, if you really want to be good you
have to be trained in Cremona, Italy.

790
00:59:31,617 --> 00:59:33,909
I want to go there when I graduate from junior high.

791
00:59:34,627 --> 00:59:36,367
You're not going to high school?

792
00:59:36,923 --> 00:59:38,118
My parents think I am,

793
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:40,253
but my grandpa is trying to convince them otherwise.

794
00:59:40,612 --> 00:59:43,041
I guess we'll have to see. Cross your fingers.

795
00:59:55,689 --> 00:59:58,181
That's great that you know what
you want to do with your life.

796
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:00,793
I don't have a clue what I want to do with mine.

797
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:03,420
I just waste time writing corny lyrics.

798
01:00:03,813 --> 01:00:06,482
I know what I want to do, but I
don't know if I'll get to do it.

799
01:00:06,926 --> 01:00:08,594
I fight with my parents about it everyday.

800
01:00:09,507 --> 01:00:12,406
Even if I get to go, it doesn't
mean that I'll be any good at it.

801
01:00:12,543 --> 01:00:14,496
I'll just have to do my best and find out.

802
01:00:17,771 --> 01:00:19,017
You sure you don't want a ride home?

803
01:00:19,041 --> 01:00:21,004
Yeah. It's just around the corner.

804
01:00:21,416 --> 01:00:22,059
See ya.

805
01:00:23,316 --> 01:00:24,762
Uh, Shizuku...

806
01:00:26,667 --> 01:00:27,162
Yeah?

807
01:00:27,177 --> 01:00:30,886
I just wanted to say that I actually liked
your lyrics. You're a very talented writer.

808
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:33,708
You should keep pursuing it. It's not a waste of time.

809
01:00:34,303 --> 01:00:36,909
Just the other day you told me my lyrics were corny.

810
01:00:37,222 --> 01:00:38,562
Oh, did I really say that?

811
01:00:38,879 --> 01:00:39,945
Seiji!

812
01:00:40,401 --> 01:00:41,231
I'm sorry.

813
01:00:42,754 --> 01:00:45,575
Ha! You're forgetful, too. See you later.

814
01:01:05,552 --> 01:01:08,849
Shizuku, turn off your lamp. You
left it on all night last night.

815
01:01:16,553 --> 01:01:19,172
When did you know what to do with your life?

816
01:01:19,399 --> 01:01:20,799
What are you talking about?

817
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:21,894
You know!

818
01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:24,563
Don't worry about it. You'll take your exams

819
01:01:24,579 --> 01:01:27,471
and whatever high school you get
into will pretty much decide things.

820
01:01:27,616 --> 01:01:28,886
Don't we get a choice?

821
01:01:29,076 --> 01:01:30,680
You do if you study hard.

822
01:01:32,161 --> 01:01:33,097
Now go to sleep.

823
01:01:33,597 --> 01:01:34,280
Good night.

824
01:01:49,131 --> 01:01:52,455
I can't believe Mom didn't wake me up.
She's getting more forgetful than I am.

825
01:01:55,919 --> 01:01:56,227
Oh!

826
01:02:02,306 --> 01:02:03,369
Uh, hello?

827
01:02:03,385 --> 01:02:04,186
Oh, hello.

828
01:02:05,514 --> 01:02:06,959
Can't you run any faster?

829
01:02:07,316 --> 01:02:08,779
You don't have to wait for me.

830
01:02:27,196 --> 01:02:28,347
Just made it.

831
01:02:28,839 --> 01:02:30,087
Shizuku, what happened?

832
01:02:30,896 --> 01:02:32,236
Ah, you look like a wreck.

833
01:02:32,283 --> 01:02:34,985
Well, you seem fine. You sure do recover fast.

834
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:38,068
Is it true that you were out with
a boy from another class last night?

835
01:02:38,244 --> 01:02:40,055
What?! Where did you hear that?

836
01:02:40,302 --> 01:02:40,991
It's a rumor.

837
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:42,930
They say it looked like the two of you are going steady.

838
01:02:43,013 --> 01:02:44,631
It's nothing like that, Yuko.

839
01:02:45,004 --> 01:02:46,554
I'm not really worried about it.

840
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:52,641
It's what the book says.

841
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:54,675
Yuko, about my friend's letter,

842
01:02:54,691 --> 01:02:56,938
I'll tell my friend you're not interested. I'm sorry.

843
01:02:57,112 --> 01:02:59,536
Mm... No, I'm the one who should apologize.

844
01:03:00,218 --> 01:03:00,972
It's OK.

845
01:03:05,957 --> 01:03:10,023
Hey, did you see Sasuke last night? I
was blown away. It was the best ever!

846
01:03:17,435 --> 01:03:19,796
This formula's gonna be on tomorrow's test, class,

847
01:03:19,812 --> 01:03:21,391
So make sure you know it.

848
01:03:23,201 --> 01:03:24,457
Class dismissed.

849
01:03:26,473 --> 01:03:27,888
You forgot your books.

850
01:03:29,866 --> 01:03:32,122
I'm a little nervous to ask her out. I mean, should 1?

851
01:03:33,163 --> 01:03:34,054
I didn't even get to see.

852
01:03:34,871 --> 01:03:35,689
No way!

853
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:46,965
Excuse me, is this Shizuku's classroom?

854
01:03:48,047 --> 01:03:49,647
Hey, Amasawa, what's up?

855
01:03:50,153 --> 01:03:52,084
I'm looking for Shizuku. Is she in here?

856
01:03:52,632 --> 01:03:55,341
Shizuku? Yeah, she's here.

857
01:03:55,648 --> 01:03:59,322
Hey, Shizuku, you got a visitor. It's a guy!

858
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:05,655
Seiji, she's right over there.

859
01:04:08,352 --> 01:04:09,403
Hi, Seiji.

860
01:04:09,931 --> 01:04:11,987
Shizuku, can we talk for a minute?

861
01:04:12,677 --> 01:04:13,632
Uh, sure.

862
01:04:13,915 --> 01:04:16,500
Check it out! Shizuku's got a boyfriend!

863
01:04:18,495 --> 01:04:20,193
Shizuku's got a boyfriend.

864
01:04:20,812 --> 01:04:23,316
No, I don't. Hey, he's not my boyfriend!

865
01:04:25,001 --> 01:04:25,607
Aw, come on.

866
01:04:26,208 --> 01:04:27,091
Boyfri...

867
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:31,690
All right, what is it?

868
01:04:31,949 --> 01:04:34,319
I get to go to Cremona, Italy. I just found out.

869
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:37,056
What? Come on, let's go.

870
01:04:41,923 --> 01:04:42,872
Where are we going?

871
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:43,912
To the roof.

872
01:04:51,862 --> 01:04:53,016
Oh, excellent.

873
01:04:54,088 --> 01:04:58,068
Seiji, why did you broadcast to the
class that you wanted to talk to me?

874
01:04:58,642 --> 01:05:02,008
I'm sorry. I was excited and I
wanted you to be the first to know.

875
01:05:04,487 --> 01:05:07,753
But now people might get the idea that you like me.

876
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:09,797
Don't worry about it.

877
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,640
Hey, so even though my parents gave in, there's a catch.

878
01:05:12,727 --> 01:05:14,507
Oh. What's the catch?

879
01:05:14,634 --> 01:05:15,733
Well, when I'm in Italy,

880
01:05:15,749 --> 01:05:19,432
I have to try out with this friend
of my grandpa's who owns the workshop.

881
01:05:20,004 --> 01:05:20,702
Try out?

882
01:05:21,327 --> 01:05:23,949
Yeah, my parents said I get two months to prove myself.

883
01:05:23,965 --> 01:05:26,134
If my grandpa's friend doesn't think I have potential,

884
01:05:26,537 --> 01:05:28,639
then I have to come back here and go to high school.

885
01:05:30,571 --> 01:05:33,176
I've heard that this guy is
really tough on his apprentices,

886
01:05:33,772 --> 01:05:37,188
so it doesn't seem fair that my
parents are only giving me one shot.

887
01:05:37,545 --> 01:05:39,340
But it's a great opportunity, so I'm going.

888
01:05:39,356 --> 01:05:40,972
When? Do you leave soon?

889
01:05:41,321 --> 01:05:42,649
As soon as I get my passport.

890
01:05:43,089 --> 01:05:45,717
My dad said that he was going to notify the school today.

891
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,448
Wow, that fast, huh?

892
01:05:49,534 --> 01:05:51,535
I'm happy for you. Your dream's coming true.

893
01:05:51,786 --> 01:05:54,180
I hope so. I'm going to give it everything I've got.

894
01:05:57,323 --> 01:05:57,961
Would you...?

895
01:06:00,755 --> 01:06:02,708
Hey, it stopped raining. Look.

896
01:06:02,771 --> 01:06:03,713
Yeah, you're right.

897
01:06:04,795 --> 01:06:06,263
Wow! Look at that view.

898
01:06:12,195 --> 01:06:13,545
Maybe we'll see a rainbow.

899
01:06:13,965 --> 01:06:14,482
Yeah.

900
01:06:25,487 --> 01:06:27,614
I wonder what Cremona, Italy will be like.

901
01:06:28,097 --> 01:06:30,057
I hope it turns out to be a nice place.

902
01:06:30,469 --> 01:06:32,511
Mm-hm. The city's really old,

903
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,640
and everybody there thinks violin making is respectable.

904
01:06:36,124 --> 01:06:36,878
That's great.

905
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,680
It's so brave of you to go after your dream like that.

906
01:06:40,498 --> 01:06:42,363
I just waste my time reading books,

907
01:06:42,568 --> 01:06:45,269
and all I've been dreaming about was
we would go to the same high school.

908
01:06:45,445 --> 01:06:45,720
But...

909
01:06:46,876 --> 01:06:49,551
OK, that was embarrassing. I shouldn't have said that.

910
01:06:53,674 --> 01:06:54,884
Sh! Stay down.

911
01:06:55,499 --> 01:06:56,733
Do you think they'll kiss?

912
01:06:56,775 --> 01:06:57,511
Come on, hurry up.

913
01:07:07,473 --> 01:07:09,920
You know, I noticed you a long time ago.

914
01:07:10,125 --> 01:07:12,151
I first spotted you reading in the library.

915
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:15,623
I walked past you hundreds of
times, but you never noticed me, right?

916
01:07:17,102 --> 01:07:19,787
I even sat down in the chair
right next to you a couple times.

917
01:07:19,803 --> 01:07:20,525
Yeah?

918
01:07:21,427 --> 01:07:25,992
Then I started checking out all sorts of books just
so I can get my name on the checkout cards before you.

919
01:07:26,036 --> 01:07:27,184
I guess that got your attention.

920
01:07:28,715 --> 01:07:32,591
But now... I have to take off to Italy.

921
01:07:32,607 --> 01:07:34,771
That's some pretty lousy timing, don't you think?

922
01:07:39,167 --> 01:07:40,514
Yeah, that's pretty bad.

923
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,257
Hey, quit pushin'!

924
01:07:43,272 --> 01:07:44,261
I can't see!

925
01:07:51,226 --> 01:07:52,603
You jerks!

926
01:07:55,452 --> 01:07:58,293
Get out of the way! Shizuku is really mad!

927
01:08:06,985 --> 01:08:07,717
Hey!

928
01:08:34,608 --> 01:08:35,291
Here, Dad.

929
01:08:35,656 --> 01:08:35,974
Thank you.

930
01:08:35,991 --> 01:08:37,236
I'm going to Yuko's.

931
01:08:37,251 --> 01:08:39,237
Shizuku, is that all you're having?

932
01:08:40,556 --> 01:08:41,525
I'm not hungry.

933
01:08:44,834 --> 01:08:47,194
Pick up some milk on your way home, OK?

934
01:08:47,534 --> 01:08:48,669
I don't feel like it.

935
01:08:49,552 --> 01:08:51,326
Hey, you're the one who drank it all.

936
01:08:52,625 --> 01:08:55,420
She's really been slacking off these last few days.

937
01:09:03,503 --> 01:09:04,405
Taxi!

938
01:09:06,824 --> 01:09:08,358
Sorry, I can't go.

939
01:09:15,302 --> 01:09:16,683
Thanks for meeting me, Yuko.

940
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:17,778
No problem.

941
01:09:18,184 --> 01:09:20,311
I've never been so confused in my life.

942
01:09:20,327 --> 01:09:21,663
Mom, Shizuku's here.

943
01:09:21,774 --> 01:09:22,864
Shizuku, how nice to see you.

944
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,054
Hi, Mrs. Harada.

945
01:09:27,012 --> 01:09:27,861
Hello, girls.

946
01:09:28,506 --> 01:09:29,228
Hi, Mr. Harada.

947
01:09:29,243 --> 01:09:30,156
Hi, Shizuku.

948
01:09:31,532 --> 01:09:33,470
Would you two like some tea and cookies?

949
01:09:33,486 --> 01:09:34,472
Yeah. Thanks, Mom.

950
01:09:35,194 --> 01:09:37,807
I'm having a fight with my father. I'm not talking to him.

951
01:09:44,985 --> 01:09:46,842
Boys really have guts, don't they?

952
01:09:48,422 --> 01:09:52,051
He'll be gone for two months. He's only
returning for our graduation ceremony,

953
01:09:52,067 --> 01:09:54,603
then he's going back again to study for about ten years.

954
01:09:55,028 --> 01:09:56,597
You'll practically never see him again.

955
01:09:57,912 --> 01:09:58,955
But you're so lucky.

956
01:09:58,971 --> 01:10:01,794
The two of you sound like the
perfect match, like soul mates.

957
01:10:01,929 --> 01:10:04,521
No, he's so much better than me. We read the same books,

958
01:10:04,537 --> 01:10:06,554
but I never do anything with what I learn.

959
01:10:06,956 --> 01:10:08,931
He decided long ago what he wanted to do.

960
01:10:08,947 --> 01:10:10,510
And he's going straight for his dream.

961
01:10:10,916 --> 01:10:11,774
I guess so.

962
01:10:13,489 --> 01:10:16,689
You know what? Kinuyo was in
the same first-year class as Seiji.

963
01:10:16,925 --> 01:10:19,733
She said he was a little hard
to approach, but a good student,

964
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:21,656
and really handsome, too.

965
01:10:21,950 --> 01:10:23,389
You don't need to rub it in.

966
01:10:23,683 --> 01:10:25,709
I already feel like I'm not good enough.

967
01:10:25,917 --> 01:10:27,296
This whole thing is doomed.

968
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:30,130
No, it's not. All that matters is he likes you.

969
01:10:30,217 --> 01:10:31,175
Didn't he say that?

970
01:10:31,699 --> 01:10:32,238
Yeah.

971
01:10:32,756 --> 01:10:34,042
But I'm not sure I believe it.

972
01:10:36,858 --> 01:10:37,793
I don't get you.

973
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:42,724
It's so cool. You could be writing letters
and encouraging each other every single day.

974
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,334
How could I ever encourage him?

975
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:47,364
He's worked so much harder than I ever have.

976
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:49,026
You are weird.

977
01:10:50,442 --> 01:10:52,625
Just because you haven't decided what you're going to do

978
01:10:52,641 --> 01:10:54,905
after you graduate from junior high school

979
01:10:54,921 --> 01:10:57,041
doesn't mean that you're not good enough for him.

980
01:10:59,728 --> 01:11:01,791
Everyone in school thinks you're talented.

981
01:11:02,106 --> 01:11:05,534
You've read more books than anyone
I know, and your lyrics are great.

982
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:09,276
And you can tell people just
what you feel. I can't do that.

983
01:11:11,977 --> 01:11:13,900
I'm not close to being good enough.

984
01:11:13,923 --> 01:11:14,752
Yes, you are.

985
01:11:14,767 --> 01:11:15,243
Mm-mm.

986
01:11:15,466 --> 01:11:16,664
That's what Seiji said.

987
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:18,945
He isn't sure that he has any talent either.

988
01:11:19,334 --> 01:11:21,086
I should test myself like he is.

989
01:11:23,448 --> 01:11:25,657
That's what I'll do. I'll try being a writer.

990
01:11:26,373 --> 01:11:27,508
I've already got a story.

991
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:29,408
I've got two months to see what I can do.

992
01:11:30,975 --> 01:11:32,443
But midterms are coming up.

993
01:11:32,673 --> 01:11:34,652
That's OK. Thanks, Yuko.

994
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,004
I feel like maybe I can handle this now.

995
01:11:37,241 --> 01:11:37,822
You're going?

996
01:11:37,838 --> 01:11:39,203
Yeah. I've gotta get writing.

997
01:11:42,348 --> 01:11:43,549
Bye, Mr. and Mrs. Harada.

998
01:11:43,574 --> 01:11:43,947
Bye, Sumo.

999
01:11:43,962 --> 01:11:45,711
Say hello to your mom for me.

1000
01:11:45,767 --> 01:11:46,457
I will.

1001
01:11:49,937 --> 01:11:51,207
You hang in there too, Yuko.

1002
01:11:51,714 --> 01:11:52,230
Mm-hm.

1003
01:11:52,888 --> 01:11:55,462
I'm sure Sugimura will see what a good person you are.

1004
01:11:57,699 --> 01:11:58,464
See you later.

1005
01:12:00,723 --> 01:12:02,474
So that's it. It's simple.

1006
01:12:02,641 --> 01:12:04,727
All I have to do is give my writing a try.

1007
01:12:09,344 --> 01:12:09,937
Moon.

1008
01:12:13,178 --> 01:12:15,861
Muta! Muta!

1009
01:12:16,344 --> 01:12:19,252
Hey, Mom, Muta ran off again.

1010
01:12:19,952 --> 01:12:21,343
Where does he keep going?

1011
01:12:22,001 --> 01:12:22,932
Muta. Huh.

1012
01:12:26,834 --> 01:12:30,701
Whisper of the Heart by Shizuku Tsukishima.

1013
01:12:31,435 --> 01:12:33,325
"Listen to the voice of the forest

1014
01:12:33,861 --> 01:12:37,043
and the wind that blows from a far-off cluster of stars."

1015
01:12:56,244 --> 01:12:59,138
So, you want to write a story about The Baron?

1016
01:12:59,405 --> 01:13:01,370
Something about him inspires me,

1017
01:13:01,838 --> 01:13:03,799
but I know The Baron has special meaning for you,

1018
01:13:03,927 --> 01:13:06,748
so I thought I'd better ask your
permission before I use him in my book.

1019
01:13:08,531 --> 01:13:09,936
You can use The Baron.

1020
01:13:11,046 --> 01:13:12,220
Thank you for asking,

1021
01:13:12,355 --> 01:13:14,739
but I'd like to ask for a favor in return.

1022
01:13:15,924 --> 01:13:16,440
Yes?

1023
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:22,241
Once you have finished your story, I
want to be the first to read it. Hm?

1024
01:13:22,575 --> 01:13:24,466
Oh, uh... I...

1025
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:25,947
Is it a deal?

1026
01:13:26,349 --> 01:13:28,005
Do I really have to show it to you?

1027
01:13:28,649 --> 01:13:31,463
I've never written anything
before. I'm afraid it's gonna stink.

1028
01:13:33,871 --> 01:13:36,874
You sound just like all the other artists that I've met.

1029
01:13:37,212 --> 01:13:40,061
No one should expect perfection
when they're first starting out.

1030
01:13:40,663 --> 01:13:43,002
Wait a minute. I've got something to show you.

1031
01:13:49,704 --> 01:13:51,425
I think you'll like this.

1032
01:13:55,712 --> 01:13:56,478
Take a look.

1033
01:14:01,865 --> 01:14:03,256
It looks like a rock.

1034
01:14:05,084 --> 01:14:07,849
It's a special kind of rock called a geode.

1035
01:14:08,134 --> 01:14:10,200
Hold it close to your eye and look inside.

1036
01:14:10,531 --> 01:14:11,856
That's right, like that.

1037
01:14:21,082 --> 01:14:21,769
Wow.

1038
01:14:23,721 --> 01:14:24,865
Look at that.

1039
01:14:25,032 --> 01:14:26,859
Those crystals are called beryl.

1040
01:14:27,008 --> 01:14:29,901
There are pieces of raw emeralds deep inside them.

1041
01:14:30,528 --> 01:14:32,651
Aren't emeralds worth a lot of money?

1042
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:33,364
Sure.

1043
01:14:34,462 --> 01:14:36,960
But they need to be cut and polished first.

1044
01:14:37,434 --> 01:14:40,190
When you first become an artist, you are like that rock.

1045
01:14:40,435 --> 01:14:44,074
You're in a raw natural state, with hidden gems inside.

1046
01:14:44,202 --> 01:14:48,325
You have to dig down deep and find
the emeralds tucked away inside you.

1047
01:14:49,786 --> 01:14:51,264
And that's just the beginning.

1048
01:14:51,494 --> 01:14:54,029
Once you've found your gems, you have to polish them.

1049
01:14:54,703 --> 01:14:56,587
It takes a lot of hard work.

1050
01:14:56,825 --> 01:15:00,886
Oh, and here's the tricky part.
Look at the crack in the geode.

1051
01:15:01,386 --> 01:15:02,013
OK.

1052
01:15:02,599 --> 01:15:04,703
You see that big green crystal there?

1053
01:15:05,025 --> 01:15:09,450
You could spend years polishing that
and it wouldn't be worth much at all.

1054
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:12,039
The smaller crystals are much more valuable,

1055
01:15:12,149 --> 01:15:15,398
and there may be some even deeper inside that we can't see

1056
01:15:15,445 --> 01:15:17,005
which are even more precious.

1057
01:15:17,475 --> 01:15:20,454
Oh, it's bad to get old. You just keep rambling.

1058
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:21,741
I'll shut up now.

1059
01:15:23,715 --> 01:15:26,446
What if I look inside myself and I don't find any gems?

1060
01:15:26,462 --> 01:15:27,603
What if I'm just a rock?

1061
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,888
I'm going to try anyway.

1062
01:15:30,055 --> 01:15:32,347
I'll write that story and I'll
let you be the first to read it.

1063
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:35,809
That's the spirit. I'll be looking forward to it.

1064
01:15:44,043 --> 01:15:47,813
A raw gem in a vein of lapis lazuli.

1065
01:15:51,992 --> 01:15:54,177
Ah, let us go forth together,

1066
01:15:54,595 --> 01:15:57,600
in search of the vein of lapis lazuli.

1067
01:15:59,338 --> 01:16:00,738
Look. Be not fearful.

1068
01:16:01,247 --> 01:16:03,750
On the day of the new moon space is warped.

1069
01:16:07,102 --> 01:16:10,512
As such, things far away loom large,

1070
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:13,356
whereas things near at hand appear small.

1071
01:16:13,785 --> 01:16:15,509
Come, let us fly.

1072
01:16:15,816 --> 01:16:17,947
We will rise on the updraft!

1073
01:16:23,072 --> 01:16:24,107
But we must hurry!

1074
01:16:24,434 --> 01:16:26,583
Quick! The planetoids are gathering.

1075
01:16:28,658 --> 01:16:29,476
Shall we?

1076
01:16:29,795 --> 01:16:32,985
And... off we go!

1077
01:16:39,085 --> 01:16:41,313
That's it! We're riding the air currents.

1078
01:16:42,044 --> 01:16:44,563
See that tower? We'll clear it in a single leap.

1079
01:16:45,103 --> 01:16:46,780
Are you kidding? That's so high.

1080
01:16:46,856 --> 01:16:52,037
Ah, it just looks high. You'll see once we get closer.

1081
01:17:08,612 --> 01:17:11,448
Let's go. When the afternoon air currents mix,

1082
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:13,794
we can even touch the stars without fear.

1083
01:17:15,393 --> 01:17:16,582
That's strange.

1084
01:17:20,374 --> 01:17:22,133
Shizuku's in nonfiction?

1085
01:17:22,649 --> 01:17:25,421
I've never seen her look at anything but fairy tales.

1086
01:18:04,664 --> 01:18:07,778
It's a prisoner locked in a cell and he's making a violin.

1087
01:18:40,765 --> 01:18:41,603
Seiji!

1088
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,920
I thought you had left for Italy.

1089
01:18:45,376 --> 01:18:48,177
I just talked to my grandpa. He said you might be here.

1090
01:18:49,588 --> 01:18:51,996
I'm glad I found you. I'm leaving tomorrow.

1091
01:18:52,798 --> 01:18:53,642
You are?

1092
01:18:55,883 --> 01:18:58,555
Go on. You should keep working.

1093
01:18:58,730 --> 01:18:59,999
I'll wait until you're done.

1094
01:19:26,663 --> 01:19:28,067
Sorry I can't see you home.

1095
01:19:29,988 --> 01:19:31,871
I'm just glad I was able to see you again.

1096
01:19:32,532 --> 01:19:33,947
I can't go to the airport with you,

1097
01:19:33,963 --> 01:19:35,788
but I'll be waiting for you when you come back.

1098
01:19:36,354 --> 01:19:37,653
I'll see you in two months then.

1099
01:19:44,809 --> 01:19:48,064
I'm sorry for complaining all the time, Seiji.

1100
01:19:48,681 --> 01:19:50,616
I promise I'll work hard while you're gone.

1101
01:19:57,765 --> 01:19:59,292
Well, I better go.

1102
01:20:02,989 --> 01:20:04,053
Have a safe trip.

1103
01:20:22,862 --> 01:20:25,101
Louise, my betrothed and I,

1104
01:20:25,715 --> 01:20:28,040
were born in a far-off land.

1105
01:20:32,776 --> 01:20:36,291
Back then, magic was still alive in our town,

1106
01:20:36,991 --> 01:20:39,174
and the streets were lined with shops

1107
01:20:39,515 --> 01:20:43,135
where the descendents of magicians worked as artisans.

1108
01:20:47,312 --> 01:20:51,763
The craftsman who made us was
a poor apprentice doll maker.

1109
01:20:55,615 --> 01:20:59,935
But Louise and I were happy, for the man who made us

1110
01:21:00,353 --> 01:21:02,732
gave us the ability to love.

1111
01:21:04,459 --> 01:21:06,408
Then one day...

1112
01:21:12,364 --> 01:21:13,229
Shizuku.

1113
01:21:14,252 --> 01:21:15,038
Shizuku!

1114
01:21:16,907 --> 01:21:17,856
Shizuku!

1115
01:21:20,141 --> 01:21:21,308
The answer, Shizuku?

1116
01:21:22,464 --> 01:21:23,159
Stand up.

1117
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:26,990
I don't know, sir. I wasn't paying attention.

1118
01:21:27,157 --> 01:21:29,212
You haven't been paying attention all week.

1119
01:21:29,714 --> 01:21:30,715
I'm sorry, sir.

1120
01:21:30,913 --> 01:21:32,812
Yuko, will you help out Shizuku?

1121
01:21:32,939 --> 01:21:33,488
Yes, sir.

1122
01:21:35,424 --> 01:21:38,427
What? You were up until four in the morning?

1123
01:21:38,625 --> 01:21:41,272
I just can't seem to stop writing for some reason.

1124
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:45,731
You keep spacing out all the time, like today.

1125
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:48,226
I was thinking about my story.

1126
01:21:48,249 --> 01:21:50,537
There's so much I want to write. I can't find enough time.

1127
01:21:52,921 --> 01:21:54,421
I don't feel like eating.

1128
01:22:23,692 --> 01:22:26,028
Oh! Shizuku, it's you.

1129
01:22:26,715 --> 01:22:29,413
You scared me half to death.
Why didn't you have the lights on?

1130
01:22:30,141 --> 01:22:32,435
Oh, Shizuku, you didn't finish the laundry.

1131
01:22:32,451 --> 01:22:34,824
Get in here, Shizuku! Shizuku!

1132
01:22:39,144 --> 01:22:41,386
Where's Shizuku? Doesn't she want dinner?

1133
01:22:42,271 --> 01:22:43,577
She said she isn't hungry.

1134
01:23:04,882 --> 01:23:07,648
Can you believe that? She actually said that.

1135
01:23:08,759 --> 01:23:10,437
Oh, hello, Mrs. Tsukishima.

1136
01:23:10,576 --> 01:23:11,771
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1137
01:23:11,786 --> 01:23:12,708
No trouble at all.

1138
01:23:13,214 --> 01:23:15,089
Do you know if the career counseling room is open?

1139
01:23:15,619 --> 01:23:16,007
Yeah.

1140
01:23:17,015 --> 01:23:17,634
Come this way.

1141
01:23:24,442 --> 01:23:25,431
I'm home.

1142
01:23:28,844 --> 01:23:29,561
Hi there, Mom.

1143
01:23:30,854 --> 01:23:32,191
You're home early today.

1144
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:36,348
I'm exhausted.

1145
01:23:36,864 --> 01:23:37,751
Want some coffee?

1146
01:23:37,997 --> 01:23:38,981
Sounds great.

1147
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:44,731
So, Mom, there's something I need to talk to you about.

1148
01:23:45,172 --> 01:23:47,810
Not something bad, I hope. I already have a headache.

1149
01:23:51,597 --> 01:23:53,720
I'm thinking of moving into my own place.

1150
01:23:54,225 --> 01:23:55,851
I found the greatest apartment.

1151
01:23:56,330 --> 01:23:58,441
Honey, can you really afford to move out?

1152
01:23:58,973 --> 01:24:01,015
I saved some money from my temp job,

1153
01:24:01,298 --> 01:24:04,685
and I just got a part-time
position in a test-preparation school.

1154
01:24:05,529 --> 01:24:09,285
I see. I've gotten so used to you
helping me out while I'm in school.

1155
01:24:09,954 --> 01:24:12,591
But we'll be fine. I'll talk to your father about it.

1156
01:24:12,963 --> 01:24:14,956
Really? Thanks, Mom.

1157
01:24:17,468 --> 01:24:19,459
Financially, I think you'll have to manage on your own

1158
01:24:19,475 --> 01:24:21,477
until I finish my last semester of school.

1159
01:24:21,673 --> 01:24:23,796
Once I graduate I can help you out.

1160
01:24:23,979 --> 01:24:25,176
That'd be great.

1161
01:24:25,590 --> 01:24:28,718
I hate to do this now while you're
in the middle of your master's thesis.

1162
01:24:28,734 --> 01:24:30,166
No. Don't worry about it.

1163
01:24:30,569 --> 01:24:33,581
I really appreciate all the help
you gave me preparing the data.

1164
01:24:34,393 --> 01:24:36,267
It'll be good for Shizuku to have her own room

1165
01:24:36,283 --> 01:24:39,653
so she can focus on her studies.
She's been acting so strange lately.

1166
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:41,176
You're telling me.

1167
01:24:41,828 --> 01:24:45,391
I had a conference today with
one of her teachers. Look at this.

1168
01:24:46,236 --> 01:24:47,393
Huh. What is it?

1169
01:24:49,254 --> 01:24:52,097
What's happened to her? I've never seen grades this low.

1170
01:24:53,409 --> 01:24:55,828
It's so strange. I wonder what she's doing.

1171
01:24:55,844 --> 01:24:57,379
She's at her desk all day.

1172
01:25:05,756 --> 01:25:06,738
Oh, good evening.

1173
01:25:07,054 --> 01:25:08,099
Good evening.

1174
01:25:10,459 --> 01:25:11,409
Thank you.

1175
01:25:17,430 --> 01:25:20,142
With grades like that, no high school will accept you.

1176
01:25:20,974 --> 01:25:23,156
Fine. I'm not going to high school anyway.

1177
01:25:23,834 --> 01:25:27,471
Are you crazy? You think a
junior high education is enough?

1178
01:25:27,567 --> 01:25:29,300
What kind of fantasy world are you living in?

1179
01:25:29,713 --> 01:25:32,168
Hey, it's my future so I make the decision.

1180
01:25:32,255 --> 01:25:35,585
Don't give me that attitude. You
know you're being completely ridiculous.

1181
01:25:35,801 --> 01:25:38,262
If you keep acting like this, you will ruin your life.

1182
01:25:38,278 --> 01:25:40,747
Oh yeah. School's really made your life great.

1183
01:25:40,787 --> 01:25:43,543
All you've done since you went
to college is work part-time jobs.

1184
01:25:43,559 --> 01:25:46,461
That's right. I'm making money and I can support myself.

1185
01:25:46,505 --> 01:25:48,813
What job do you think you're going
to get without a college degree?

1186
01:25:48,828 --> 01:25:52,635
You'll end up destitute just because
you're in some stupid rebellious phase.

1187
01:25:52,651 --> 01:25:55,114
I'm not being rebellious. I'm going after my dreams.

1188
01:25:55,221 --> 01:25:58,331
What dreams are you going after?
You just goof around reading books.

1189
01:25:59,714 --> 01:26:02,279
Stop the arguing, girls. I've heard enough.

1190
01:26:02,917 --> 01:26:05,961
But, Dad, she's gonna ruin her life if she keeps this up.

1191
01:26:06,435 --> 01:26:09,320
Hm... All right. Let's go to the kitchen and discuss this.

1192
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:12,226
Shizuku, change out of your uniform first, please.

1193
01:26:14,921 --> 01:26:15,753
Hurry it up.

1194
01:26:29,996 --> 01:26:30,830
A bit low.

1195
01:26:31,608 --> 01:26:34,025
Shizuku, are you doing the best you can?

1196
01:26:34,104 --> 01:26:36,266
Yes! I take these tests very seriously.

1197
01:26:36,377 --> 01:26:39,022
Just a little bit ago, you said
you weren't going to high school.

1198
01:26:39,073 --> 01:26:41,643
You were the one who said no high school would accept me.

1199
01:26:41,659 --> 01:26:44,453
Shiho, I'd like to talk to Shizuku alone.

1200
01:26:44,522 --> 01:26:46,387
Would you please excuse yourself, honey?

1201
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:47,228
Fine.

1202
01:26:50,526 --> 01:26:52,741
Where's your mother? - She's at the Tanaka's.

1203
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:54,283
I'm home.

1204
01:26:54,473 --> 01:26:56,514
There she is. Hey, Mom.

1205
01:26:56,598 --> 01:26:57,644
Is your father home?

1206
01:26:57,659 --> 01:26:58,683
He's in the kitchen.

1207
01:26:58,812 --> 01:27:02,102
Honey, could you come in here?
I'm having a talk with Shizuku.

1208
01:27:02,332 --> 01:27:03,911
Sure. Just a second.

1209
01:27:10,349 --> 01:27:12,634
All right, Shizuku.

1210
01:27:14,111 --> 01:27:15,727
You have something that you're doing

1211
01:27:15,743 --> 01:27:18,226
that you think is more important than studying?

1212
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:22,300
Will you tell us what it is?

1213
01:27:24,111 --> 01:27:25,651
When I can tell you, I will.

1214
01:27:26,389 --> 01:27:30,198
Shizuku, can't you do whatever
it is once your exams are over?

1215
01:27:30,543 --> 01:27:33,503
I have to do it now. I've only
got three weeks left before he...

1216
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:37,597
It's that I promised myself I'd achieve this certain goal,

1217
01:27:38,270 --> 01:27:39,401
or I'm not good enough.

1218
01:27:39,503 --> 01:27:40,750
Good enough for what?

1219
01:27:41,396 --> 01:27:43,062
Why do you need to prove yourself?

1220
01:27:44,754 --> 01:27:47,147
We can't help you unless you tell us what's going on.

1221
01:27:48,728 --> 01:27:51,865
What could you be doing that you
can't tell your mother and father about?

1222
01:27:53,342 --> 01:27:54,305
Honey, please.

1223
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,337
Oh, sorry. I'll put it out.

1224
01:28:06,117 --> 01:28:07,838
You work so hard in the library.

1225
01:28:07,854 --> 01:28:10,051
Whatever you're doing, I know it's important to you.

1226
01:28:10,774 --> 01:28:12,282
And I truly respect that.

1227
01:28:13,594 --> 01:28:16,874
Honey, why don't we let Shizuku
do what she thinks is best?

1228
01:28:17,904 --> 01:28:20,364
Not everyone needs to follow the same path.

1229
01:28:20,521 --> 01:28:21,170
Hm...

1230
01:28:22,331 --> 01:28:26,301
Well, I have to admit I've often dreamed
about straying from the path myself.

1231
01:28:28,042 --> 01:28:31,433
All right, Shizuku, go ahead
and do what your heart tells you.

1232
01:28:32,655 --> 01:28:36,590
But it's never easy when you do
things differently from everyone else.

1233
01:28:37,306 --> 01:28:40,587
If things don't go well, you'll
only have yourself to blame.

1234
01:28:42,026 --> 01:28:44,815
And I want you to eat meals with
us, no matter how busy you get.

1235
01:28:44,902 --> 01:28:47,280
That's right. We like to see you once in a while.

1236
01:28:47,359 --> 01:28:47,901
OK.

1237
01:28:48,369 --> 01:28:49,738
Tell your sister we're finished.

1238
01:28:53,253 --> 01:28:54,298
I'll make us some tea.

1239
01:28:57,857 --> 01:28:58,989
Hey, Shizuku.

1240
01:29:00,826 --> 01:29:02,284
Dad let you have your own way,

1241
01:29:02,299 --> 01:29:05,192
but he really wants you to study
hard and get into a good high school.

1242
01:29:05,349 --> 01:29:08,185
I know that. It was written all over his face.

1243
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:11,261
By the way, I'm gonna be moving out next Sunday.

1244
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:13,885
You'll have the room to yourself.

1245
01:29:14,448 --> 01:29:16,507
You're moving out? I didn't know that.

1246
01:29:16,626 --> 01:29:18,673
Yep. You're gonna be on your own now.

1247
01:29:29,836 --> 01:29:34,151
Hurry! Faster! Faster!

1248
01:29:34,961 --> 01:29:37,107
Only one stone is genuine.

1249
01:29:37,461 --> 01:29:39,498
Which one? Which one is real?

1250
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,294
You are on your own now.

1251
01:29:41,944 --> 01:29:44,162
You must make the choice yourself.

1252
01:29:45,022 --> 01:29:45,693
Hurry!

1253
01:31:23,225 --> 01:31:25,536
Louise, you've come back to me.

1254
01:31:25,805 --> 01:31:29,450
I'm sorry I've grown old. I didn't know you'd return.

1255
01:31:55,259 --> 01:31:58,348
Shizuku. Please, come on in.

1256
01:31:58,729 --> 01:32:00,691
I was just taking a nap.

1257
01:32:02,266 --> 01:32:04,448
Did I wake you? I'm sorry.

1258
01:32:04,591 --> 01:32:07,251
I hate to bother you, Mr. Nishi, but my story's finished.

1259
01:32:09,416 --> 01:32:11,710
Ooh, wonderful.

1260
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:14,102
Oh, you should be very proud.

1261
01:32:15,519 --> 01:32:18,700
Well, here it is. You're the first
one to read it, just as promised.

1262
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:21,313
Well, this is a good-sized novel.

1263
01:32:21,771 --> 01:32:24,747
Whisper of the Heart by Shizuku Tsukishima.

1264
01:32:25,026 --> 01:32:27,751
I know it's a bit long, but could you read it right away?

1265
01:32:27,957 --> 01:32:29,865
I'll just wait here, if you don't mind.

1266
01:32:29,881 --> 01:32:32,685
I could, but you've put so much into this.

1267
01:32:32,701 --> 01:32:34,884
Shouldn't I take my time and read it carefully?

1268
01:32:35,505 --> 01:32:37,902
I'd rather you read it now, 'cause I'm kind of nervous.

1269
01:32:38,108 --> 01:32:40,215
You don't have to read it all, just a few pages.

1270
01:32:41,112 --> 01:32:43,686
And then... then if it's boring you can quit.

1271
01:32:44,588 --> 01:32:47,054
I understand. I'll read it right away.

1272
01:32:47,245 --> 01:32:50,376
Have a seat by the fire. It's getting cold.

1273
01:32:55,698 --> 01:32:58,505
There. Now no one will disturb us.

1274
01:33:02,456 --> 01:33:05,751
Uh, would it be OK with you if I wait downstairs?

1275
01:33:05,917 --> 01:33:06,555
Hm?

1276
01:33:06,751 --> 01:33:07,794
I won't get cold.

1277
01:33:07,929 --> 01:33:09,245
I'd rather not watch you read.

1278
01:33:11,233 --> 01:33:14,092
Hm... That'll be fine. Go ahead.

1279
01:34:27,769 --> 01:34:29,377
So, there you are.

1280
01:34:29,701 --> 01:34:31,609
I finished your book, Shizuku.

1281
01:34:34,216 --> 01:34:36,726
Thank you, dear. It was really wonderful.

1282
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,520
No, it's not! It's a mess.

1283
01:34:38,536 --> 01:34:40,474
The storyline goes all over the place.

1284
01:34:40,490 --> 01:34:42,359
All the characters' dialogue sounds corny.

1285
01:34:42,634 --> 01:34:45,917
You have to tell me the truth.
I know it's a complete disaster.

1286
01:34:46,425 --> 01:34:50,001
No. It's just a bit rough, dear, like Seiji's violin.

1287
01:34:50,285 --> 01:34:52,266
What I read was raw and heartfelt.

1288
01:34:54,818 --> 01:34:57,154
You should be very proud for all your hard work.

1289
01:34:57,320 --> 01:35:00,386
You've dug inside your soul and found some real gems.

1290
01:35:01,268 --> 01:35:04,897
Next you'll need to polish it,
which will also take a lot of work.

1291
01:35:06,707 --> 01:35:10,586
There's no need to be upset. Just have a little patience.

1292
01:35:35,769 --> 01:35:38,746
Now let's go inside. It's cold out here.

1293
01:35:38,984 --> 01:35:39,462
OK.

1294
01:35:40,796 --> 01:35:43,488
I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't be crying.

1295
01:35:44,244 --> 01:35:46,405
I wanted so badly to do a good job,

1296
01:35:46,929 --> 01:35:49,137
but there's so much that I don't know about writing.

1297
01:35:50,949 --> 01:35:54,960
And Seiji, he's so much more accomplished than I am.

1298
01:35:55,635 --> 01:35:57,074
I can never catch up.

1299
01:35:57,657 --> 01:35:59,491
I can never be good enough.

1300
01:36:02,038 --> 01:36:04,819
I see. You must be very fond of Seiji.

1301
01:36:25,408 --> 01:36:27,734
How do you like your noodles, hm?

1302
01:36:28,969 --> 01:36:30,195
I like them a lot.

1303
01:36:31,689 --> 01:36:34,311
When Seiji finished making his very first violin,

1304
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:36,979
he was far more upset than you are today.

1305
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:40,109
It took four batches of noodles to calm him down.

1306
01:36:44,152 --> 01:36:45,560
Ah, thank you, dear.

1307
01:36:47,331 --> 01:36:50,292
Now tell me, how far did we get into The Baron's story?

1308
01:36:50,510 --> 01:36:53,448
You were a student in Germany
when you found The Baron in a cafe.

1309
01:36:54,567 --> 01:36:55,985
Ah, that's right.

1310
01:36:57,466 --> 01:37:01,637
I was captivated by his expression.
It was so sad and mysterious.

1311
01:37:01,804 --> 01:37:05,031
So I begged the owner of the cafe to let me buy The Baron.

1312
01:37:06,233 --> 01:37:08,336
But he refused to sell it to me.

1313
01:37:08,611 --> 01:37:12,439
He said The Baron had a female
companion who was away for repairs.

1314
01:37:12,711 --> 01:37:17,135
The two of them made such a beautiful couple,
he didn't think it was right to separate them.

1315
01:37:17,752 --> 01:37:22,296
I told him that as soon as The
Baroness was repaired, I'd buy them both.

1316
01:37:22,852 --> 01:37:25,855
The Baroness, her name was Louise, isn't that right?

1317
01:37:26,699 --> 01:37:29,367
No one knows this, but Louise was the name

1318
01:37:30,124 --> 01:37:32,007
of a woman I went to school with.

1319
01:37:32,198 --> 01:37:34,023
She and I became very close,

1320
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:38,465
and every day we'd meet at the cafe
to see if The Baroness had returned.

1321
01:37:39,253 --> 01:37:42,327
<i>Louise pleaded with the cafe owner to sell me The Baron.</i>

1322
01:37:42,765 --> 01:37:48,023
She promised to buy The Baroness and hold
onto her until the two statues could be reunited.

1323
01:37:48,939 --> 01:37:50,972
Finally the cafe owner agreed,

1324
01:37:51,074 --> 01:37:53,283
and I left for Japan with The Baron.

1325
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:57,518
I promised Louise that I would
return to Germany as soon as possible,

1326
01:37:58,516 --> 01:38:02,050
and I vowed that when The
Baron and Baroness were reunited,

1327
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:03,902
so would we be.

1328
01:38:07,413 --> 01:38:09,955
But the war began soon after my departure

1329
01:38:09,971 --> 01:38:13,706
and I wasn't able to return to
Germany until many years later.

1330
01:38:16,406 --> 01:38:19,464
I visited our café and I searched all over Germany,

1331
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:21,230
but I could find no trace of her.

1332
01:38:22,877 --> 01:38:26,637
I never saw Louise or The Baroness again.

1333
01:38:28,811 --> 01:38:32,155
I'm sorry. So that's why you
never want to talk about The Baron.

1334
01:38:32,750 --> 01:38:35,261
But you've done something wonderful for me, Shizuku.

1335
01:38:35,585 --> 01:38:39,430
What was only a memory for me has
gained new life, thanks to your story.

1336
01:38:39,904 --> 01:38:41,203
Oh, that reminds me.

1337
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:51,554
Now, hold out your hands.

1338
01:38:58,127 --> 01:38:59,031
But I...

1339
01:38:59,421 --> 01:39:01,495
That geode suits you better than me.

1340
01:39:02,348 --> 01:39:03,633
I want you to have it.

1341
01:39:04,933 --> 01:39:07,182
Promise me you'll polish your story well.

1342
01:39:08,058 --> 01:39:08,671
I will.

1343
01:39:24,487 --> 01:39:26,122
Thanks for everything, Mr. Nishi.

1344
01:39:26,138 --> 01:39:26,915
My pleasure.

1345
01:39:30,343 --> 01:39:31,386
See you later.

1346
01:39:42,426 --> 01:39:43,360
Anyone home?

1347
01:39:43,613 --> 01:39:44,548
I'm in here.

1348
01:39:47,966 --> 01:39:48,950
Is Dad around?

1349
01:39:49,569 --> 01:39:50,604
He's in the bathtub.

1350
01:39:50,738 --> 01:39:52,866
Do you know what time it is, young lady?

1351
01:39:53,111 --> 01:39:54,988
I'd like to make a formal announcement.

1352
01:39:55,179 --> 01:39:57,300
I've decided that I want to attend high school.

1353
01:39:57,688 --> 01:39:59,168
I'll start studying tomorrow.

1354
01:39:59,255 --> 01:39:59,874
Really?

1355
01:40:00,147 --> 01:40:02,194
Does that mean you've already finished your project?

1356
01:40:02,352 --> 01:40:03,363
For the time being.

1357
01:40:05,792 --> 01:40:08,019
Do you want dinner? I made curry.

1358
01:40:08,432 --> 01:40:09,495
No, thanks.

1359
01:40:11,145 --> 01:40:12,514
For the time being, huh?

1360
01:40:22,649 --> 01:40:24,804
Shizuku, the bathroom's free if you want it.

1361
01:40:45,250 --> 01:40:46,907
Look at her, my little warrior.

1362
01:40:50,042 --> 01:40:51,082
Let's see.

1363
01:40:58,308 --> 01:40:59,447
Sweet dreams.

1364
01:41:16,671 --> 01:41:17,163
Huh?

1365
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:55,161
Seiji?

1366
01:42:02,995 --> 01:42:04,516
Yeah. Just a second.

1367
01:42:19,893 --> 01:42:21,907
I can't believe this. You were actually awake.

1368
01:42:22,374 --> 01:42:23,834
This isn't a dream, is it?

1369
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:26,737
No. I came back from Italy a day early. Get on.

1370
01:42:27,801 --> 01:42:28,556
Oh, wait a minute.

1371
01:42:29,555 --> 01:42:30,651
You'll be cold like that.

1372
01:42:33,765 --> 01:42:34,846
OK, hop on.

1373
01:42:36,043 --> 01:42:37,326
You'll be cold. I'll get a jacket.

1374
01:42:37,341 --> 01:42:39,184
There's not enough time. Let's go.

1375
01:42:41,686 --> 01:42:43,259
All right, hold on tight now.

1376
01:42:49,192 --> 01:42:51,077
I wanted to see you as soon as I got home,

1377
01:42:51,343 --> 01:42:54,150
so I stood outside your window
hoping you'd look outside and see me.

1378
01:42:54,843 --> 01:42:57,796
Suddenly you were standing
there. I couldn't believe my eyes.

1379
01:42:58,249 --> 01:43:00,100
We must be meant for each other, Shizuku.

1380
01:43:00,809 --> 01:43:02,556
I still can't believe I'm not dreaming.

1381
01:43:02,864 --> 01:43:04,432
Who cares? This is a great dream.

1382
01:43:10,603 --> 01:43:12,007
How did things go in Italy?

1383
01:43:12,070 --> 01:43:14,354
My master said I'm not great yet, but I could be.

1384
01:43:14,668 --> 01:43:16,539
So I've decided to finish high school first,

1385
01:43:16,778 --> 01:43:17,928
then I'll go back to Cremona.

1386
01:43:27,422 --> 01:43:28,636
Should I get off?

1387
01:43:28,866 --> 01:43:29,883
No. Stay on.

1388
01:43:30,441 --> 01:43:34,181
I decided I was going to ride up this steep hill

1389
01:43:34,612 --> 01:43:35,780
carrying you with me.

1390
01:43:36,383 --> 01:43:38,036
Who said you could decide that?

1391
01:43:40,201 --> 01:43:42,372
I don't want to be just a burden for you.

1392
01:43:43,221 --> 01:43:43,629
Oh!

1393
01:43:45,988 --> 01:43:48,539
If I'm going with you, I'm going to help you.

1394
01:43:50,319 --> 01:43:52,352
All right, go ahead and help.

1395
01:43:53,004 --> 01:43:54,243
Just a bit further.

1396
01:44:08,734 --> 01:44:11,403
Shizuku, hurry up! Get on!

1397
01:44:29,450 --> 01:44:31,223
Ah, just in time.

1398
01:44:32,691 --> 01:44:33,405
Wow.

1399
01:44:36,327 --> 01:44:37,202
Need a hand?

1400
01:44:37,217 --> 01:44:38,067
I'm fine.

1401
01:44:41,644 --> 01:44:42,405
Look at this.

1402
01:44:59,964 --> 01:45:00,797
Amazing.

1403
01:45:01,249 --> 01:45:03,448
With all that mist, it looks like the ocean.

1404
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:05,949
Yeah. This is where I come to get inspired.

1405
01:45:06,335 --> 01:45:07,251
You'll see in a second.

1406
01:45:52,992 --> 01:45:54,325
I wanted to show this to you.

1407
01:45:54,669 --> 01:45:55,587
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1408
01:45:58,011 --> 01:46:00,568
Grandpa told me about all the
amazing writing you've been doing.

1409
01:46:01,343 --> 01:46:03,213
I feel bad that I wasn't here to encourage you.

1410
01:46:03,804 --> 01:46:05,507
I was just off thinking about myself.

1411
01:46:05,684 --> 01:46:08,663
Mm-mm. You're the one who inspired me, Seiji.

1412
01:46:09,512 --> 01:46:12,690
I'm glad I pushed myself. I know
myself a little bit better now.

1413
01:46:15,203 --> 01:46:17,187
I realized I need a lot more schooling,

1414
01:46:17,625 --> 01:46:20,030
so I don't mind doing what it
takes to get into a good high school.

1415
01:46:20,890 --> 01:46:23,103
Shizuku. I've been thinking.

1416
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:25,024
It's that...

1417
01:46:25,849 --> 01:46:27,691
I know this might sound really weird to you,

1418
01:46:28,748 --> 01:46:30,728
but could you see us getting married someday?

1419
01:46:32,366 --> 01:46:34,548
I promise I'll be a professional violin maker,

1420
01:46:34,904 --> 01:46:36,445
and you can be a professional writer.

1421
01:46:39,383 --> 01:46:40,007
Mm-hm.

1422
01:46:41,634 --> 01:46:42,756
Does this sound corny?

1423
01:46:43,176 --> 01:46:46,180
It's a little corny, but you're
a violin maker, not a writer.

1424
01:46:46,259 --> 01:46:47,989
That's true. This is great!

1425
01:46:48,966 --> 01:46:51,145
Come here. It's getting cold.

1426
01:46:52,755 --> 01:46:54,985
Shizuku, I love you!
