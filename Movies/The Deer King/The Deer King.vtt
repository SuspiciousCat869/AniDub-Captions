00:13:31.613 --> 00:13:35.316 position:7% line:89% align:start
I wasn't sure until now, but...

00:13:35.349 --> 00:13:38.787 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's black wolf fever,
also known as mittsual.

00:13:39.654 --> 00:13:41.422 position:19% line:89% align:start
(priests gasp, whimper)

00:13:41.455 --> 00:13:43.457 position:33% line:89% align:start
The mittsual?

00:13:46.661 --> 00:13:49.196 position:38% line:83% align:start
HOHSALLE:
All of them are Zolians?

00:13:49.229 --> 00:13:51.932 position:10% line:89% align:start
Condemned criminals, but yes.

00:13:51.965 --> 00:13:55.035 position:21% line:83% align:start
The people of Aquafa
consider this a sacred place.

00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:57.905 position:27% line:83% align:start
It would be wrong
to make them work here.

00:13:59.139 --> 00:14:00.542 position:38% line:83% align:start
HOHSALLE:
Hardly any stench.

00:14:00.575 --> 00:14:02.943 position:21% line:83% align:start
The bodies down here
are in better condition.

00:14:02.976 --> 00:14:05.312 position:7% line:83% align:start
Could we take some of them back
to the capital with us?

00:14:05.346 --> 00:14:07.014 position:41% line:83% align:start
YOTALU:
I'm sure the priest-doctors

00:14:07.047 --> 00:14:08.882 position:16% line:89% align:start
won't be happy about it.

00:14:08.916 --> 00:14:10.351 position:30% line:89% align:start
But very well.

00:14:10.384 --> 00:14:12.386 position:24% line:83% align:start
-It shall be done.
-Huh?

00:14:14.188 --> 00:14:15.557 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:17.991 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's nothing to fear.
She's one of ours.

00:14:18.025 --> 00:14:20.861 position:10% line:83% align:start
I asked her to come down here
to inspect things.

00:14:24.699 --> 00:14:26.367 position:21% line:89% align:start
What have you found?

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.435 position:38% line:83% align:start
Somehow,
one of the workers managed

00:14:28.469 --> 00:14:30.437 position:10% line:89% align:start
to make it out of here alive.

00:14:30.471 --> 00:14:31.673 position:38% line:83% align:start
HOHSALLE:
Hmm.

00:14:31.706 --> 00:14:33.040 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's been smashed.

00:14:33.073 --> 00:14:34.576 position:16% line:83% align:start
Could that have been done
by a human?

00:14:34.609 --> 00:14:37.579 position:21% line:83% align:start
SAE: He was bitten by
one of the dogs, though.

00:14:37.612 --> 00:14:39.980 position:13% line:83% align:start
That caused him to collapse
for a moment.

00:14:40.013 --> 00:14:43.150 position:7% line:83% align:start
Then he got back onto his feet,
broke out and went that way.

00:14:43.183 --> 00:14:45.386 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hey! I asked you if this
could've been done by...

00:14:45.419 --> 00:14:47.187 position:19% line:89% align:start
Makokan, let her work.

00:14:47.221 --> 00:14:50.457 position:24% line:83% align:start
A chain was dragged
across the floor here.

00:14:50.491 --> 00:14:52.226 position:13% line:89% align:start
And there are bloodstains.

00:14:52.259 --> 00:14:54.529 position:24% line:83% align:start
But the footprints
leading away suggest

00:14:54.562 --> 00:14:57.164 position:13% line:83% align:start
that he wasn't carried out
of this mine by a dog.

00:14:59.634 --> 00:15:02.436 position:21% line:83% align:start
He walked to the exit
by his own two feet.

00:15:04.171 --> 00:15:06.140 position:19% line:89% align:start
You said he was bitten.

00:15:06.173 --> 00:15:08.041 position:24% line:83% align:start
Are you sure that's
where the blood came from?

00:15:08.075 --> 00:15:10.344 position:24% line:83% align:start
This pool of blood
was fairly sizable.

00:15:10.377 --> 00:15:13.280 position:19% line:83% align:start
And the shape certainly
suggests a bite.

00:15:13.313 --> 00:15:15.115 position:19% line:89% align:start
Should that concern us?

00:15:17.151 --> 00:15:18.620 position:7% line:89% align:start
If this man did indeed survive

00:15:18.653 --> 00:15:21.288 position:24% line:83% align:start
after being bitten
by one of those dogs,

00:15:21.321 --> 00:15:23.123 position:33% line:83% align:start
then there's
a strong possibility

00:15:23.157 --> 00:15:25.192 position:10% line:89% align:start
he's immune to the mittsual.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.195 position:30% line:83% align:start
Are you saying
if we could track them down,

00:15:28.228 --> 00:15:30.164 position:21% line:83% align:start
that might be enough
to figure out a cure?

00:15:30.197 --> 00:15:32.399 position:24% line:83% align:start
If we had the blood
of a survivor

00:15:32.433 --> 00:15:35.068 position:10% line:89% align:start
and luck, yes, it's possible.

00:15:35.102 --> 00:15:37.705 position:13% line:83% align:start
YOTALU: Check the names of
all the slaves that were here.

00:15:37.739 --> 00:15:39.473 position:38% line:83% align:start
OFFICER:
M'lord.

00:15:44.077 --> 00:15:46.079 position:27% line:89% align:start
(yelling in pain)

00:15:48.115 --> 00:15:50.618 position:24% line:89% align:start
(grunts, whimpers)

00:15:59.126 --> 00:16:01.729 position:5% line:83% align:start
YOTALU: The Zolian army was once
thought invincible.

00:16:01.763 --> 00:16:03.531 position:16% line:83% align:start
Until they were wiped out
by the mittsual

00:16:03.565 --> 00:16:05.533 position:21% line:89% align:start
in a matter of days.

00:16:05.567 --> 00:16:07.602 position:21% line:89% align:start
And here it is again.

00:16:11.104 --> 00:16:13.474 position:38% line:77% align:start
OFFICER:
We've discovered the name
of the man who escaped.

00:16:13.508 --> 00:16:16.678 position:44% line:83% align:start
Van.
He came from the Gansa clan.

00:16:16.711 --> 00:16:18.613 position:35% line:89% align:start
Wait, Van?

00:16:18.646 --> 00:16:20.615 position:33% line:83% align:start
Where was he
when we took him prisoner?

00:16:20.648 --> 00:16:23.618 position:19% line:83% align:start
Records say we got him
at the battle of Kashuna River.

00:16:23.651 --> 00:16:26.253 position:16% line:89% align:start
(gasps) The Lone Antlers.

00:16:26.286 --> 00:16:28.322 position:24% line:89% align:start
Broken Antler Van.

00:16:28.355 --> 00:16:30.290 position:38% line:83% align:start
SOLDIER:
Lord Yotalu!

00:16:30.324 --> 00:16:33.393 position:16% line:89% align:start
Where is he? Lord Yotalu!

00:16:35.763 --> 00:16:37.998 position:47% line:89% align:start
♪

00:16:54.081 --> 00:16:55.783 position:21% line:89% align:start
Then he still lives.

00:16:55.817 --> 00:16:59.521 position:5% line:83% align:start
To think, there was an Aquafaese
down there after all.

00:17:01.488 --> 00:17:03.290 position:16% line:89% align:start
She will find him for us.

00:17:03.323 --> 00:17:05.259 position:33% line:83% align:start
That woman is
the greatest tracker

00:17:05.292 --> 00:17:06.728 position:16% line:89% align:start
this land has ever known.

00:17:06.761 --> 00:17:08.295 position:27% line:89% align:start
Can you find him?

00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:12.600 position:38% line:89% align:start
She will.

00:17:12.634 --> 00:17:15.135 position:27% line:83% align:start
Be sure she knows
to bring him back to us alive.

00:17:15.168 --> 00:17:17.304 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yes, of course, sir.

00:17:19.139 --> 00:17:21.074 position:19% line:89% align:start
You heard Sir Hohsalle.

00:17:21.108 --> 00:17:23.711 position:35% line:83% align:start
We need you
to bring him back alive.

00:17:25.713 --> 00:17:27.682 position:27% line:83% align:start
That will not be
an easy task, sir.

00:17:27.715 --> 00:17:28.917 position:35% line:89% align:start
This Van is

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:33.253 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>a surviving member</i>
 <i>of the elusive Lone Antlers.</i>

00:17:33.287 --> 00:17:35.055 position:27% line:89% align:start
(horse whinnies)

00:17:35.857 --> 00:17:37.457 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:37.491 --> 00:17:39.159 position:27% line:89% align:start
Wait! Come back!

00:17:39.192 --> 00:17:40.728 position:38% line:89% align:start
(groans)

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.465 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hey, you.
How are you riding my pyuika?

00:17:45.499 --> 00:17:46.634 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:17:46.668 --> 00:17:48.335 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow.

00:17:48.368 --> 00:17:51.706 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're the only person I've ever
seen mounted on one of those.

00:17:51.739 --> 00:17:53.841 position:10% line:89% align:start
Didn't think it was possible.

00:17:53.875 --> 00:17:55.843 position:7% line:89% align:start
There was a pack of ossam dogs

00:17:55.877 --> 00:17:58.646 position:19% line:83% align:start
that came flooding out
of the forest all of a sudden.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.648 position:16% line:89% align:start
They spooked the pyuika.

00:18:00.682 --> 00:18:02.717 position:10% line:83% align:start
It slipped free of its reins
and took off.

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:05.252 position:21% line:83% align:start
Flipped my cart over
on top of me in the process.

00:18:05.285 --> 00:18:07.421 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well... (grunts)

00:18:07.454 --> 00:18:10.592 position:24% line:83% align:start
at least those dogs
didn't eat the poor beast.

00:18:10.625 --> 00:18:13.293 position:7% line:83% align:start
A healthy pyuika will fetch you
a king's ransom

00:18:13.327 --> 00:18:15.697 position:10% line:83% align:start
if you're willing to sell it
to the Zolian army.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:18.866 position:7% line:89% align:start
That's why I became a breeder.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.135 position:35% line:83% align:start
Of course,
that's easier said than done.

00:18:22.169 --> 00:18:25.339 position:21% line:83% align:start
All of mine are wild.
They won't obey my commands.

00:18:25.372 --> 00:18:27.575 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't understand
what the Zolians want

00:18:27.609 --> 00:18:29.744 position:7% line:83% align:start
-with such stubborn creatures.
-Tasty.

00:18:29.777 --> 00:18:31.746 position:16% line:89% align:start
(chuckles) That's fahmu.

00:18:31.779 --> 00:18:34.147 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's a Zolian specialty.

00:18:34.181 --> 00:18:35.583 position:13% line:89% align:start
My wife baked them herself.

00:18:35.617 --> 00:18:38.620 position:5% line:83% align:start
-They're delicious, aren't they?
-(grunting)

00:18:38.653 --> 00:18:40.588 position:24% line:83% align:start
You know, if I were
to make a guess,

00:18:40.622 --> 00:18:42.757 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'd say it's because
the Zolians didn't know

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:44.859 position:27% line:83% align:start
how to deal with
the Aquafaese pyuika riders

00:18:44.892 --> 00:18:47.528 position:21% line:89% align:start
during the last war.

00:18:47.562 --> 00:18:49.530 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:18:50.932 --> 00:18:53.901 position:24% line:83% align:start
MAN: You really are
something special, mister.

00:18:53.935 --> 00:18:56.738 position:7% line:83% align:start
I thought the one I already had
would calm down a little

00:18:56.771 --> 00:18:58.338 position:13% line:89% align:start
if I bought another female,

00:18:58.372 --> 00:19:00.642 position:21% line:83% align:start
so I decided to spend
what coin I had on me.

00:19:00.675 --> 00:19:02.744 position:10% line:89% align:start
But she's already with child.

00:19:04.712 --> 00:19:06.681 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Is she really?
-Mm.

00:19:06.714 --> 00:19:08.482 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:19:08.516 --> 00:19:11.485 position:27% line:83% align:start
These pyuika are
a complete mystery to me.

00:19:11.519 --> 00:19:14.454 position:10% line:83% align:start
I guess I should be thankful
for my injury.

00:19:14.488 --> 00:19:17.592 position:7% line:83% align:start
Or perhaps I should be thankful
for this little goddess, huh?

00:19:17.625 --> 00:19:20.528 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Yunacha!
-Huh? Yunacha?

00:19:20.561 --> 00:19:22.664 position:35% line:83% align:start
-VAN: Yuna.
-(Yuna chuckles)

00:19:22.697 --> 00:19:25.198 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's her name. Yuna.

00:19:25.232 --> 00:19:27.434 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah.

00:19:27.467 --> 00:19:29.771 position:24% line:89% align:start
Gotcha. I'm Tohma.

00:19:31.806 --> 00:19:33.473 position:38% line:89% align:start
I'm Van.

00:19:33.508 --> 00:19:34.909 position:41% line:83% align:start
TOHMA:
Yuna and Van.

00:19:34.942 --> 00:19:37.477 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, I'm much obliged.

00:19:37.512 --> 00:19:40.648 position:7% line:83% align:start
Say, have you heard the latest
about the ossam dogs?

00:19:40.682 --> 00:19:43.685 position:16% line:83% align:start
Apparently, they attacked
the lord's falconry party.

00:19:43.718 --> 00:19:47.522 position:21% line:77% align:start
 <i>Whatever's happening</i>
 <i>with them,</i>
 <i>it sure doesn't bode well.</i>

00:19:47.555 --> 00:19:49.289 position:41% line:83% align:start
 <i>UTALU:</i>
 <i>Is it true?</i>

00:19:49.322 --> 00:19:51.959 position:13% line:89% align:start
Every one of them is dead?

00:19:51.993 --> 00:19:54.929 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yes. Slaves and soldiers,
for a total of 600.

00:19:54.962 --> 00:19:57.732 position:41% line:83% align:start
UTALU:
Killed by lowly dogs?

00:19:57.765 --> 00:20:00.768 position:7% line:89% align:start
Actually, Sir Hohsalle says...

00:20:00.802 --> 00:20:03.437 position:10% line:89% align:start
they contracted the mittsual.

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.840 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gasps, sighs)

00:20:05.873 --> 00:20:07.842 position:21% line:89% align:start
The curse of Aquafa.

In our grandfathers' era,

00:20:11.679 --> 00:20:13.715 position:27% line:83% align:start
the Zolian troops
who stormed this land

00:20:13.748 --> 00:20:15.750 position:16% line:89% align:start
fell prey to the disease.

00:20:15.783 --> 00:20:19.854 position:21% line:83% align:start
It was said to be the
retribution of dead Aquafaese.

00:20:19.887 --> 00:20:23.825 position:7% line:83% align:start
I wonder if it's a coincidence
that it's returned now,

00:20:23.858 --> 00:20:26.794 position:27% line:83% align:start
just in time for
the Emperor's Eyes visit.

00:20:26.828 --> 00:20:29.564 position:21% line:83% align:start
Forgive me, my lord,
but this curse

00:20:29.597 --> 00:20:31.498 position:30% line:83% align:start
is nothing more
than a superstition.

00:20:31.532 --> 00:20:33.868 position:10% line:83% align:start
The people of Aquafa pledged
our loyalty to you

00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:35.570 position:21% line:89% align:start
nearly ten years ago,

00:20:35.603 --> 00:20:37.572 position:24% line:83% align:start
and we would never
turn our backs on you.

00:20:37.605 --> 00:20:39.507 position:7% line:83% align:start
-UTALU: What of the Aquafaese?
-Uh...

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.408 position:30% line:89% align:start
600 casualties.

00:20:41.441 --> 00:20:43.678 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Were any of them from Aquafa?
-AQUAFA KING: Well, I...

00:20:43.711 --> 00:20:45.780 position:38% line:83% align:start
No, none.
But, brother, that doesn't...

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:58.025 position:41% line:83% align:start

Tohlim.

00:20:58.059 --> 00:21:00.962 position:24% line:89% align:start
(grunts, chuckles)

00:21:00.995 --> 00:21:05.265 position:7% line:89% align:start
Loyal servant of Aquafa's king.

00:21:06.067 --> 00:21:08.368 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:21:09.402 --> 00:21:10.938 position:38% line:89% align:start
Lick it.

00:21:12.707 --> 00:21:15.910 position:16% line:83% align:start
Come over here and prove
the mittsual is no curse

00:21:15.943 --> 00:21:17.912 position:13% line:89% align:start
by contracting it yourself.

00:21:19.947 --> 00:21:21.549 position:21% line:89% align:start
As you wish, my lord.

00:21:30.792 --> 00:21:31.959 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.529 position:38% line:89% align:start
(retches)

00:21:34.562 --> 00:21:35.963 position:38% line:89% align:start
Brother.

00:21:36.931 --> 00:21:38.900 position:33% line:89% align:start
Sir Hohsalle!

00:21:42.804 --> 00:21:44.972 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:21:45.006 --> 00:21:47.608 position:30% line:83% align:start
At this stage,
herbs won't be of any use.

00:21:47.642 --> 00:21:48.943 position:16% line:89% align:start
What can help him, then?

00:21:48.976 --> 00:21:50.745 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll need to make an anti-poison

00:21:50.778 --> 00:21:52.880 position:21% line:83% align:start
by diluting the blood
of someone who was infected.

00:21:52.914 --> 00:21:55.883 position:21% line:83% align:start
Out of the question!
Lord Utalu's pure imperial blood

00:21:55.917 --> 00:21:58.886 position:24% line:83% align:start
must not be sullied
by that of a mere commoner.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.556 position:13% line:83% align:start
His survival is better left
for fate to decide.

00:22:01.589 --> 00:22:03.490 position:13% line:89% align:start
Bodies are not but vessels.

00:22:03.524 --> 00:22:06.493 position:13% line:83% align:start
Tainting Lord Utalu's soul
would be deplorable.

00:22:06.527 --> 00:22:08.495 position:21% line:83% align:start
-PRIESTS: Deplorable!
-UTALU: I need nothing.

00:22:08.529 --> 00:22:10.531 position:10% line:83% align:start
I shall heal this affliction
myself,

00:22:10.565 --> 00:22:12.399 position:19% line:89% align:start
without such medicine.

00:22:12.432 --> 00:22:14.101 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well spoken, Lord Utalu.

00:22:14.135 --> 00:22:16.504 position:5% line:83% align:start
There is nothing more imperative
than maintaining

00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:18.438 position:16% line:89% align:start
the purity of your soul.

00:22:19.439 --> 00:22:22.475 position:13% line:89% align:start
(Utalu groaning, wheezing)

00:22:24.846 --> 00:22:26.747 position:41% line:83% align:start
UTALU:
I shall not die.

00:22:27.849 --> 00:22:29.951 position:27% line:89% align:start
I shall not die.

00:22:29.984 --> 00:22:31.619 position:35% line:89% align:start

00:22:37.424 --> 00:22:38.893 position:10% line:89% align:start
 <i>are immune to the mittsual?</i>

00:22:38.926 --> 00:22:41.929 position:7% line:83% align:start
That Zolians are the only ones
who can catch it?

00:22:41.963 --> 00:22:44.464 position:19% line:89% align:start
Some books say so, yes.

00:22:44.497 --> 00:22:46.033 position:16% line:89% align:start
Is something wrong, sir?

00:22:46.067 --> 00:22:48.970 position:7% line:83% align:start
I found Tohlim's calm demeanor
a bit peculiar.

00:22:49.003 --> 00:22:50.605 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hmm.
-(chuckles)

00:22:50.638 --> 00:22:52.540 position:30% line:83% align:start
Well, a disease
certainly doesn't care

00:22:52.573 --> 00:22:54.374 position:16% line:89% align:start
what country you're from.

00:22:55.176 --> 00:22:56.811 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:22:56.844 --> 00:22:59.780 position:16% line:83% align:start
This Emperor's Eyes visit
is such nonsense.

00:22:59.814 --> 00:23:01.782 position:16% line:83% align:start
I know Fire Horse Village
is sacred,

00:23:01.816 --> 00:23:03.483 position:21% line:83% align:start
but why must they go
to the trouble

00:23:03.517 --> 00:23:05.485 position:33% line:83% align:start
of traveling
such a great distance?

00:23:05.519 --> 00:23:07.454 position:33% line:83% align:start
I think it's
because of the mittsual.

00:23:07.487 --> 00:23:10.591 position:7% line:83% align:start
It once forced the Zolian army
to retreat from there.

00:23:10.625 --> 00:23:12.860 position:10% line:83% align:start
They wish to reshape history,
I suppose,

00:23:12.894 --> 00:23:14.862 position:24% line:89% align:start
and to dispel fear.

00:23:14.896 --> 00:23:17.064 position:38% line:83% align:start
MAKOKAN:
In that case, it's a bit ironic

00:23:17.098 --> 00:23:19.867 position:19% line:83% align:start
that the mittsual would
return now, don't you think?

00:23:19.901 --> 00:23:23.037 position:38% line:77% align:start
HOHSALLE:
No. I suspect that's more
than coincidence.

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:24.772 position:38% line:83% align:start
MAKOKAN:
Really? How so?

00:23:24.805 --> 00:23:26.874 position:16% line:83% align:start
HOHSALLE: You're not just
a swordsman anymore.

00:23:26.908 --> 00:23:28.776 position:30% line:89% align:start
Use your head.

AQUAFA KING:
The falconry and the salt mine.

00:23:33.114 --> 00:23:36.183 position:19% line:83% align:start
So far, it's all going
according to plan.

00:23:36.217 --> 00:23:38.519 position:21% line:83% align:start
Once Yotalu succeeds
his brother,

00:23:38.552 --> 00:23:41.488 position:19% line:83% align:start
Zol will be much easier
to control.

00:23:41.522 --> 00:23:43.891 position:13% line:89% align:start
We're making good progress.

00:23:43.925 --> 00:23:47.995 position:13% line:83% align:start
And yet, we must be careful
not to move forward too hastily.

OHFAN:
Are you afraid?

00:23:49.697 --> 00:23:52.199 position:21% line:83% align:start
Because at this rate,
the Emperor's Eyes

00:23:52.233 --> 00:23:55.870 position:7% line:83% align:start
are going to be at the doorstep
of my village as soon as spring.

00:23:55.903 --> 00:23:57.805 position:30% line:89% align:start
Have patience.

00:23:57.838 --> 00:24:01.108 position:10% line:83% align:start
One of the slaves in the mine
was Aquafaese.

00:24:02.109 --> 00:24:04.078 position:16% line:89% align:start
We must maintain secrecy,

00:24:04.111 --> 00:24:07.148 position:35% line:83% align:start
so proceed
with the utmost caution.

00:24:07.181 --> 00:24:10.685 position:10% line:83% align:start
OHFAN: I take no orders from
the spineless minions of Zol.

00:24:10.718 --> 00:24:12.186 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ohfan, wait.

00:24:12.219 --> 00:24:14.989 position:27% line:83% align:start
Is there a reason
for you to be so impatient?

00:24:19.193 --> 00:24:21.162 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's concerning.

OHMA:
I'd completely forgotten.

00:38:56.804 --> 00:39:00.541 position:7% line:83% align:start
Many years ago, the Zolian army
came through here

00:39:00.575 --> 00:39:04.411 position:10% line:83% align:start
and laid waste to everything,
scaring all the pyuika away.

00:39:04.444 --> 00:39:06.681 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just the mention of Zol

00:39:06.714 --> 00:39:08.115 position:19% line:83% align:start
would send us trembling
and running for cover.

00:39:09.584 --> 00:39:12.653 position:21% line:83% align:start
But that all changed
about ten years ago.

00:39:12.687 --> 00:39:15.455 position:16% line:83% align:start
A group of pyuika riders
called the Lone Antlers

00:39:15.488 --> 00:39:19.727 position:5% line:83% align:start
took up arms against the Zolians
and became Aquafa's guardians.

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:22.129 position:19% line:83% align:start
It was because of them
that Zol was willing

00:39:22.163 --> 00:39:24.131 position:7% line:89% align:start
to enter into a treaty with us.

00:39:24.165 --> 00:39:26.133 position:30% line:83% align:start
And now we have
wonderful Zolian wives

00:39:26.167 --> 00:39:29.770 position:10% line:83% align:start
-to bake us delicious fahmu.
-Here, have some.

00:39:29.804 --> 00:39:33.040 position:10% line:89% align:start
None for me, dear, thank you.

00:39:33.074 --> 00:39:35.676 position:10% line:83% align:start
Zolians believe that drinking
the milk of a beast

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:37.477 position:33% line:83% align:start
will turn you
into a beast yourself.

00:39:37.511 --> 00:39:38.679 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:39:38.713 --> 00:39:41.682 position:44% line:83% align:start
VAN:
I was hunting a long time ago,

00:39:41.716 --> 00:39:44.886 position:7% line:83% align:start
and I saw a herd of pyuika get
attacked by a pack of wolves.

00:39:44.919 --> 00:39:48.488 position:10% line:83% align:start
One of the fawns wasn't quick
enough to keep up with the herd,

00:39:48.522 --> 00:39:50.892 position:19% line:83% align:start
so it was left to deal
with the wolves all by itself.

leapt forward to protect it.

00:39:54.662 --> 00:39:58.065 position:10% line:83% align:start
Stomped about to provoke them
and then ran off.

00:39:58.099 --> 00:40:01.903 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'd say an act like that is
befitting of the Deer King.

00:40:01.936 --> 00:40:04.805 position:27% line:83% align:start
Saving the fawn,
taking the brunt of the attack

00:40:04.839 --> 00:40:08.809 position:7% line:83% align:start
and vanishing into the forest--
did that make the buck a hero?

00:40:08.843 --> 00:40:11.946 position:21% line:83% align:start
Or was it just strong
and doing what needed to be done

00:40:11.979 --> 00:40:15.116 position:30% line:83% align:start
simply because
it needed to be done?

00:40:15.149 --> 00:40:17.084 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's how I saw it, anyway.

By now, Sir Hohsalle and Van

01:25:26.661 --> 01:25:28.863 position:24% line:83% align:start
should have reached
Fire Horse Village.

01:25:28.896 --> 01:25:31.766 position:27% line:83% align:start
Follow the cliffs
three leagues to the north.

01:25:31.799 --> 01:25:34.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
You'll find a secret path
to the village

01:25:34.267 --> 01:25:36.269 position:13% line:89% align:start
hidden in the mountainside.

(shallow breathing)

01:25:54.956 --> 01:25:57.257 position:24% line:89% align:start
It is morning now.

01:25:57.290 --> 01:25:59.259 position:19% line:89% align:start
Drink this pyuika milk.

01:25:59.292 --> 01:26:01.129 position:21% line:89% align:start
It will nourish you.

01:26:02.229 --> 01:26:04.197 position:5% line:89% align:start
All the villagers here drink it.

01:26:04.231 --> 01:26:07.669 position:16% line:83% align:start
And there was a time when
all the people of Aquafa did.

01:26:07.702 --> 01:26:09.904 position:24% line:83% align:start
These boys grew up
as captives of Zol,

01:26:09.937 --> 01:26:12.940 position:16% line:83% align:start
so they refuse it because
they don't like the smell.

01:26:12.974 --> 01:26:15.677 position:10% line:83% align:start
I wish I could convince them
they need it.

01:26:15.710 --> 01:26:18.311 position:7% line:89% align:start

01:26:28.856 --> 01:26:30.658 position:30% line:89% align:start

01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:38.700 position:27% line:83% align:start
You should know,
Van is here for a reason.

01:26:38.733 --> 01:26:41.602 position:7% line:83% align:start
The mittsual brought the former
leader of the Lone Antlers

01:26:41.636 --> 01:26:43.771 position:33% line:83% align:start
to this land
to become its new king.

01:26:43.805 --> 01:26:45.907 position:10% line:89% align:start
That is the will of the gods.

01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:49.911 position:21% line:83% align:start
Only the chosen ones
can survive the disease.

01:26:50.945 --> 01:26:52.980 position:38% line:83% align:start
HOHSALLE:
No! A disease is all it is,

01:26:53.014 --> 01:26:54.982 position:16% line:89% align:start
not the will of the gods.

01:26:55.016 --> 01:26:58.452 position:10% line:83% align:start
With the help of Van's blood,
I can save those children.

01:26:59.654 --> 01:27:01.288 position:33% line:89% align:start
Interesting.

01:27:01.321 --> 01:27:03.624 position:27% line:83% align:start
Then you're here
because you seek Van.

01:27:05.026 --> 01:27:06.594 position:35% line:89% align:start
Very well.

01:27:06.627 --> 01:27:08.696 position:10% line:89% align:start
I suppose all will be decided

01:27:08.730 --> 01:27:10.998 position:24% line:83% align:start
once he has become
the next Dog King.
