1
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:44,089
Saber!

2
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,295
Saber!

3
00:00:56,453 --> 00:00:57,065
Saber!

4
00:01:01,384 --> 00:01:02,061
Saber!

5
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:25,507
Saber!

6
00:01:30,594 --> 00:01:31,304
Made it.

7
00:01:32,564 --> 00:01:33,364
You're safe.

8
00:01:46,712 --> 00:01:47,841
Saber!

9
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,681
I'm back.

10
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:04,773
But how?

11
00:02:25,288 --> 00:02:26,396
Who are you?

12
00:02:28,517 --> 00:02:29,380
Better yet...

13
00:02:30,857 --> 00:02:33,027
What are you?

14
00:03:05,992 --> 00:03:08,541
On-site investigations are still ongoing,

15
00:03:08,566 --> 00:03:10,384
but ask the police arrived this moring,

16
00:03:11,013 --> 00:03:12,038
Shirou.

17
00:03:14,053 --> 00:03:15,045
Shirou?

18
00:03:16,226 --> 00:03:18,516
Oh, sorry. What's up?

19
00:03:19,245 --> 00:03:19,957
I was...

20
00:03:20,856 --> 00:03:22,952
I was just thinking about Saber.

21
00:03:23,281 --> 00:03:24,807
She left in a hurry.

22
00:03:25,177 --> 00:03:26,201
Oh, yeah.

23
00:03:35,472 --> 00:03:38,408
But now, since she's gone,

24
00:03:38,525 --> 00:03:41,757
you aren't going to have to go
out at night anymore, are you?

25
00:03:43,186 --> 00:03:45,859
So you won't be in danger like you were.

26
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,717
Isn't that right?

27
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,619
No.

28
00:03:55,813 --> 00:03:57,081
You've got it wrong.

29
00:03:58,179 --> 00:04:00,668
I wasn't going out at night to help Saber.

30
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:03,697
Saber was the one that was trying to help me.

31
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:05,912
In fact,

32
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,630
I might have to start going out more often.

33
00:04:09,272 --> 00:04:10,249
But you know,

34
00:04:10,395 --> 00:04:14,242
I'd feel a lot better if you didn't keep
waiting up for me at the front door.

35
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,623
I'll be fine.

36
00:04:21,638 --> 00:04:24,106
That's right. It's not over yet.

37
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:29,069
I still have a fight to finish.

38
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:35,296
Right here in this city.

39
00:06:01,353 --> 00:06:04,826
New City, Central Park.

40
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,867
Ryuudou Temple.

41
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,772
What exactly is that damn shadow thing trying to do?

42
00:06:14,362 --> 00:06:16,687
And what's it got to do with Zouken?

43
00:06:17,147 --> 00:06:18,798
Is he controlling it?

44
00:06:19,738 --> 00:06:22,689
Or maybe he's exploiting it.

45
00:06:25,077 --> 00:06:26,928
I should talk to Tohsaka.

46
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:37,581
What the...

47
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,055
Okay, little more.

48
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,111
Hey there, Big Brother.

49
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,613
You're still alive!

50
00:06:53,604 --> 00:06:56,040
What's your name? Will you tell me?

51
00:06:57,682 --> 00:06:59,502
Please tell me, Big Brother.

52
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:01,921
Uh, okay.

53
00:07:02,378 --> 00:07:04,965
My name's Shirou. Shirou Emiya.

54
00:07:05,536 --> 00:07:08,457
Shirou! Shirou, Shirou!

55
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:10,527
Good.

56
00:07:18,745 --> 00:07:20,951
Hey, what are you doing?

57
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:23,470
Aren't we enemies, Illyasviel?

58
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,212
You can call me Illya.

59
00:07:25,616 --> 00:07:28,989
And masters only fight against
each other at nighttime, you know?

60
00:07:29,355 --> 00:07:31,826
I just wanna have a little chat with you.

61
00:07:32,047 --> 00:07:33,754
Um, wait a sec.

62
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,936
After attacking me the way you did...

63
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:38,498
Now you wanna chat?

64
00:07:39,182 --> 00:07:41,961
Attacked you? That wasn't my fault.

65
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:46,882
You're the one who recklessly jumped
into the fight even though you're so weak.

66
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,742
If I wanted,

67
00:07:48,784 --> 00:07:50,920
I could easily kill you right here and now.

68
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:53,719
Since you don't have Saber to protect you,

69
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,766
it would be over in an instant.

70
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,343
And besides,

71
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,594
I've been waiting a long time to get this chance.

72
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:07,975
Don't I deserve a chat?

73
00:08:12,514 --> 00:08:15,911
So, you said you live in that castle in the forest?

74
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,331
All alone?

75
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,460
Sella and Liz live there, too.

76
00:08:19,695 --> 00:08:20,876
As a matter of fact,

77
00:08:20,962 --> 00:08:24,226
I had to sneak past Sella on
my way out to come see you today.

78
00:08:24,692 --> 00:08:26,080
You should feel honored!

79
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:28,408
Uh, all right.

80
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:33,948
Okay, I've got another question for you.

81
00:08:34,925 --> 00:08:38,298
Does the name Kiritsugu Emiya mean anything to you?

82
00:08:46,113 --> 00:08:46,862
Illya?

83
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,863
No, it doesn't.

84
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,655
Never heard of him.

85
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:54,200
Ever.

86
00:08:56,778 --> 00:08:57,916
I'm going home now.

87
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:00,998
Wait!

88
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:08,631
Emiya?

89
00:09:13,373 --> 00:09:15,119
Uh, Tohsaka.

90
00:09:22,445 --> 00:09:23,414
Great timing.

91
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:26,498
I wanted to talk to you about something myself.

92
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,632
Why do we have to talk here?

93
00:09:29,657 --> 00:09:31,339
We go to the same school.

94
00:09:31,848 --> 00:09:34,156
Archer, could you make us some tea?

95
00:09:36,307 --> 00:09:38,327
Huh? What do you mean, no?

96
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,037
Why are you looking at me like that?

97
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:41,330
Jeez.

98
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,082
Fine, I'll do it.

99
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,136
No way.

100
00:09:56,528 --> 00:09:57,388
Isn't that...

101
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,190
What are you doing?

102
00:10:02,989 --> 00:10:05,941
Come on. Let's figure out our game plan.

103
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:05,390
I should probably start making dinner.

104
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:17,897
Why didn't you tell me that Sakura
had a fever in the first place?

105
00:11:17,922 --> 00:11:21,013
Because you wouldn't stop talking
long enough to give me the chance.

106
00:11:22,754 --> 00:11:23,474
It's open.

107
00:11:24,501 --> 00:11:25,573
Sakura?

108
00:11:25,922 --> 00:11:26,929
Are you awake?

109
00:11:41,225 --> 00:11:43,995
Emiya! Oh, great!

110
00:11:59,182 --> 00:12:00,177
Shinji!

111
00:12:00,476 --> 00:12:02,007
Let Sakura go!

112
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:08,639
Shinji!

113
00:12:09,585 --> 00:12:12,064
Don't worry, Sakura. It's okay.

114
00:12:12,576 --> 00:12:15,103
I promise I'm not going to kill Emiya.

115
00:12:15,593 --> 00:12:17,100
I just want him to suffer.

116
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,697
Make him feel a little bit of pain, that's all.

117
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:22,825
You're going to fight Rider.

118
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:27,018
If you can survive that, then I'll let her go.

119
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,356
Rider, get him.

120
00:12:32,816 --> 00:12:34,105
You're a fool.

121
00:12:34,674 --> 00:12:36,505
If you came here to fight...

122
00:12:37,713 --> 00:12:40,171
You shouldn't have done so all by yourself.

123
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,179
Try harder, Emiya!

124
00:13:22,232 --> 00:13:25,387
It'll be terribly dull if you kick the bucket too easily.

125
00:13:33,102 --> 00:13:35,895
Endurance rewards the true victor.

126
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:42,252
Excellent.

127
00:13:42,403 --> 00:13:44,426
But no more going easy on him.

128
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:49,633
Kill this pathetic charlatan right now!

129
00:13:49,855 --> 00:13:51,260
Shinji, please stop!

130
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:15,025
Sakura.

131
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,191
Shirou?

132
00:14:33,937 --> 00:14:34,794
How?

133
00:14:47,317 --> 00:14:48,718
It was Magecraft.

134
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,150
Rider!

135
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,554
Kill that bastard now!

136
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:56,328
T... Tohsaka?

137
00:15:56,934 --> 00:15:58,207
But why?

138
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:02,101
Emiya and I have a mutually beneficial arrangement.

139
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:06,423
Because of that, we happened
to be working together all day.

140
00:16:07,836 --> 00:16:09,705
You used Sakura as bait.

141
00:16:10,982 --> 00:16:12,425
That was a big mistake,

142
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:14,475
'cause that makes you my enemy.

143
00:16:16,786 --> 00:16:17,570
Sakura.

144
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:23,007
Sakura, Sakura, Sakura, Sakura, Sakura, Sakura!

145
00:16:23,324 --> 00:16:26,125
Why do you care so much about what happens to her?

146
00:16:26,216 --> 00:16:28,870
I'm the Matou that became the master here!

147
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:35,350
Stand up, Rider!

148
00:16:37,203 --> 00:16:38,576
Damn you!

149
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:41,664
You can't!

150
00:16:45,566 --> 00:16:50,197
Rider, you can't! It has to stop now!

151
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,687
Sakura. Emiya, get down!

152
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,255
You're kidding.

153
00:17:17,816 --> 00:17:18,661
Rider?

154
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,548
She's still...

155
00:17:26,126 --> 00:17:27,776
Very good, Rider!

156
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,696
Now end it by slaughtering them all!

157
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:34,770
Uh, hey! Rider!

158
00:17:38,046 --> 00:17:39,474
Yes, of course.

159
00:17:40,132 --> 00:17:42,352
The Matou blood line is run too thin.

160
00:17:42,544 --> 00:17:45,585
It's impossible for a mage to
be born into that family now.

161
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:49,086
I assumed Zouken was the one who summoned Rider,

162
00:17:49,379 --> 00:17:51,403
and he was lending her to Shinji,

163
00:17:52,258 --> 00:17:55,032
but the real explanation was far simpler.

164
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,992
What do you mean?

165
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,799
The way things stand for the Matous,

166
00:17:59,894 --> 00:18:02,355
only one person is fit to become a master.

167
00:18:06,456 --> 00:18:08,685
The rightful heir of the Matou name...

168
00:18:09,012 --> 00:18:11,218
the true mage of this generation...

169
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:14,760
the one Rider serves. Right, Sakura?

170
00:18:16,982 --> 00:18:20,182
You mean Sakura is a master?

171
00:18:20,935 --> 00:18:22,689
A command spell transfer.

172
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:26,622
She used that to force Rider to follow Shinji's orders.

173
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,859
That's how he became Rider's so-called master.

174
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:32,266
Hey.

175
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,385
Meanwhile, you lost your authority as her true master,

176
00:18:35,607 --> 00:18:37,908
which made you an ordinary mage.

177
00:18:39,313 --> 00:18:40,369
What the hell?

178
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,241
What are you people looking at?

179
00:18:43,096 --> 00:18:45,922
After all, the Matous created command spells.

180
00:18:46,389 --> 00:18:49,512
That's how your trick was possible. Right, Sakura?

181
00:18:55,114 --> 00:18:56,134
Hey!

182
00:18:56,562 --> 00:18:58,657
Look over here!

183
00:19:00,379 --> 00:19:02,116
We haven't finished yet.

184
00:19:02,503 --> 00:19:04,351
One more time, Sakura!

185
00:19:04,495 --> 00:19:07,528
Give me control of Rider one more time!

186
00:19:10,862 --> 00:19:13,472
Why are you acting like a goodie-goodie all of a sudden?

187
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,196
You have one more command spell.

188
00:19:16,296 --> 00:19:17,689
Use it already!

189
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:22,285
Shinji, if the last one is used, Rider will be set free.

190
00:19:22,615 --> 00:19:25,113
At that point, none of your orders will work.

191
00:19:25,138 --> 00:19:27,567
Your books will burn up, and that'll be it for you.

192
00:19:28,821 --> 00:19:32,129
Using borrowed command spells to control a servant

193
00:19:32,575 --> 00:19:35,505
means you were never really a master to begin with.

194
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,789
Shinji.

195
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:49,869
That's right.

196
00:19:50,241 --> 00:19:53,257
I knew that. I knew that.

197
00:19:53,282 --> 00:19:56,092
I knew that! I knew that!

198
00:19:56,241 --> 00:20:00,081
I've always known that I'd never
be fit for the role of a master!

199
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,875
And that's why you have to do it.

200
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:10,417
You have to kill them in my place, Sakura.

201
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:11,906
Kill them all.

202
00:20:15,604 --> 00:20:18,168
Shinji, I can't.

203
00:20:19,064 --> 00:20:20,565
We have to stop this.

204
00:20:21,765 --> 00:20:24,207
Did you already forget the promise you made me?

205
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:27,477
You said that you weren't going to kill Shirou.

206
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,528
So please, no more!

207
00:20:32,918 --> 00:20:34,764
Fine. Have it your way.

208
00:20:35,871 --> 00:20:37,319
That's how you wanna play it?

209
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:38,653
Then die.

210
00:20:49,012 --> 00:20:49,757
Sakura!

211
00:20:51,425 --> 00:20:52,215
Shirou!

212
00:20:52,575 --> 00:20:54,900
No, don't look at me!

213
00:21:07,623 --> 00:21:08,422
Sakura.

214
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,273
Damn.

215
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:19,339
It doesn't look like she can control it.

216
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:23,365
Get out of here now.

217
00:21:23,462 --> 00:21:25,907
Once she feeds on your mana, there's no going back.

218
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,756
I need you to stay out of the way.

219
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:32,655
Rider, hold back.

220
00:21:33,232 --> 00:21:35,252
Your master has lost all control.

221
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,863
If this keeps up she'll run
out of mana and self-distracted.

222
00:21:39,296 --> 00:21:43,288
She can't run out of energy as long
as she takes in more than she's losing.

223
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,200
So, no matter who your master is,

224
00:21:48,296 --> 00:21:50,907
it doesn't change the fact that you're a rotten bitch!

225
00:22:05,694 --> 00:22:06,825
A barrier?

226
00:22:14,162 --> 00:22:15,233
Stop it!

227
00:22:16,452 --> 00:22:18,503
I'm begging you, Rider, to stop!

228
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,338
Please.

229
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:25,141
It's not why I summoned you.
I didn't want anything like this.

230
00:22:26,325 --> 00:22:28,930
I cannot adhere to that command.

231
00:22:29,379 --> 00:22:33,220
Your life takes priority over everything else.

232
00:22:55,189 --> 00:22:58,066
No way. Mystic Eyes of Petrification?

233
00:22:59,221 --> 00:23:00,102
Tohsaka!

234
00:23:18,989 --> 00:23:19,894
Look out!

235
00:23:42,847 --> 00:23:45,142
Sakura...

236
00:23:58,134 --> 00:23:59,253
Sakura!

237
00:24:06,117 --> 00:24:06,945
Emiya.

238
00:24:07,664 --> 00:24:08,769
Are you all right?

239
00:24:10,297 --> 00:24:11,241
Tohsaka.

240
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,705
Oh, good. You're finally awake.

241
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:21,292
I've just finished administering
treatment to the Matou girl.

242
00:24:22,082 --> 00:24:25,380
Sakura? How is she? Is she all right?

243
00:24:25,876 --> 00:24:26,965
Calm down.

244
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,471
Rider helped us bring her here.

245
00:24:30,122 --> 00:24:32,423
Kirei, could you give us an update?

246
00:24:32,956 --> 00:24:35,082
I wouldn't say her condition is stable,

247
00:24:35,313 --> 00:24:37,301
but her life's been spared for now.

248
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:41,288
Hang on a second.

249
00:24:41,756 --> 00:24:43,144
Your magic crests.

250
00:24:43,303 --> 00:24:44,510
What happened to them?

251
00:24:48,462 --> 00:24:52,722
Using them all was the only means
I had to treat the girl successfully.

252
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,111
You used all of them?

253
00:24:56,198 --> 00:24:59,328
And there's something else I think you need to know.

254
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:04,169
She has crest worms?

255
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:06,332
What the hell are those?

256
00:25:07,804 --> 00:25:11,071
One could opt to think of them as living magic circuits.

257
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:14,737
Once a crest worm sinks its teeth into a subject,

258
00:25:15,086 --> 00:25:17,489
it penetrates every last inch of their body,

259
00:25:17,514 --> 00:25:20,393
voraciously devouring their spirit from within.

260
00:25:21,428 --> 00:25:24,943
It pierces through the skin
using its mucus as a lubricant.

261
00:25:25,379 --> 00:25:31,112
Finally it begins to feed by stimulating
then decomposing the brain's pleasure center.

262
00:25:32,617 --> 00:25:33,406
Therefore,

263
00:25:34,153 --> 00:25:39,070
any woman swarmed by such creatures
will find themselves completely violated.

264
00:25:39,736 --> 00:25:44,149
Both her mind and body will eventually be destroyed.

265
00:25:45,121 --> 00:25:47,747
Sakura Matou has experienced just s...

266
00:25:47,772 --> 00:25:48,677
That's enough!

267
00:25:50,622 --> 00:25:54,042
I felt it was prudent to provide a thorough explanation.

268
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,929
As long as these crest worms remain inside her body,

269
00:25:58,185 --> 00:26:02,685
her spirit... the very essence of her
life... will continue to be sucked away.

270
00:26:03,231 --> 00:26:05,493
Ultimately, her life will be forfeit.

271
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,897
You said her treatment was successful.

272
00:26:08,374 --> 00:26:10,226
Not entirely.

273
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,369
They've been there for 11 years.

274
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:17,206
If we pry them all out by force,
that, too, would mean her death.

275
00:26:17,741 --> 00:26:20,058
If you truly wish to eliminate them all,

276
00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:24,237
that's a task that can only be
accomplished with the Holy Grail.

277
00:26:37,838 --> 00:26:38,805
Tohsaka.

278
00:26:43,664 --> 00:26:45,687
It's my job to protect Fuyuki.

279
00:26:46,053 --> 00:26:47,436
I'll take care of her.

280
00:26:51,553 --> 00:26:52,814
Take care of her?

281
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:56,155
You're going to kill Sakura Matou?

282
00:26:56,779 --> 00:26:57,490
Yes.

283
00:26:58,009 --> 00:27:01,411
Mages that can't control their
own powers can't be allowed to live.

284
00:27:02,675 --> 00:27:05,623
She's a lost cause. A master gone mad.

285
00:27:06,956 --> 00:27:12,122
Despite the fact that biologically
speaking, she's your little sister?

286
00:27:15,821 --> 00:27:18,142
She's your sister?

287
00:27:24,277 --> 00:27:27,801
The Tohsakas... my parents-originally had two children,

288
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,114
but mages only pass their craft to one child.

289
00:27:32,065 --> 00:27:34,783
I was the chosen successor for our family.

290
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,157
But the Matou... or Makiri-bloodline had run thin.

291
00:27:39,711 --> 00:27:43,995
So they decided to adopt Sakura
and make her their successor.

292
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:45,529
So...

293
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:49,118
By blood, Sakura and I are sisters.

294
00:27:50,485 --> 00:27:53,584
Even though neither one of us has
ever described the other that way.

295
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:55,712
Hold on, Tohsaka.

296
00:27:56,338 --> 00:27:58,020
If that's true, then you can't...

297
00:28:05,345 --> 00:28:07,560
If I leave her alone in the state she's in,

298
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:10,321
that's going to happen again.

299
00:28:12,454 --> 00:28:16,937
But next time to innocent bystanders. Entirely at random.

300
00:28:17,884 --> 00:28:19,489
So I don't have a choice.

301
00:28:20,614 --> 00:28:21,852
I have to kill her.

302
00:29:00,284 --> 00:29:01,930
I guess you win, Sakura.

303
00:29:02,594 --> 00:29:04,790
So here. This is for you.

304
00:29:30,122 --> 00:29:31,666
This is the second time.

305
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:38,331
The second time someone dear to
me gave me something so special.

306
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:08,657
Where is she?

307
00:30:09,216 --> 00:30:11,469
I've gotta find her before Tohsaka does.

308
00:30:14,361 --> 00:30:18,972
But when I do find her, then what?

309
00:30:24,315 --> 00:30:25,943
Good evening to you, Shirou.

310
00:30:29,986 --> 00:30:31,973
I thought masters fought at night.

311
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:34,374
They do.

312
00:30:34,736 --> 00:30:36,538
But you're not a master anymore.

313
00:30:37,965 --> 00:30:39,912
I know everything there is to know.

314
00:30:40,585 --> 00:30:44,117
Rider's master has fallen so there are only two left.

315
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:47,831
And now you're hoping to save Rider's master,

316
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,906
but you can't find her, right?

317
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:50,679
Shut up!

318
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,632
It's okay to cry, Shirou.

319
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:10,243
Illya, you're not mad at me?

320
00:31:11,105 --> 00:31:12,537
Of course I'm not.

321
00:31:13,084 --> 00:31:14,941
I'm on your side, Shirou.

322
00:31:17,908 --> 00:31:20,775
You're on my side?

323
00:31:23,145 --> 00:31:25,898
You asked me about Kiritsugu.

324
00:31:26,168 --> 00:31:27,903
I lied. I knew him.

325
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,009
To be honest,

326
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,441
the whole reason I was born was
so that I could win the Grail War,

327
00:31:34,077 --> 00:31:35,841
but my own personal objective

328
00:31:36,082 --> 00:31:38,866
was to kill Kiritsugu and you, Shirou.

329
00:31:40,378 --> 00:31:44,683
However, if you say you're trying
to protect someone dear to you,

330
00:31:44,756 --> 00:31:45,743
I admire that.

331
00:31:46,328 --> 00:31:49,553
So therefore, I'm on your side now.

332
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:53,263
It's only natural to protect someone you love.

333
00:31:53,366 --> 00:31:54,438
Wouldn't you say?

334
00:31:55,512 --> 00:31:57,662
I know all about love, you know.

335
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,561
I don't have a home now.

336
00:32:29,593 --> 00:32:31,483
There's nowhere left for me to go.

337
00:32:42,815 --> 00:32:43,641
Sakura.

338
00:32:48,901 --> 00:32:49,827
Shirou.

339
00:32:50,858 --> 00:32:51,677
It's you.

340
00:32:53,494 --> 00:32:54,430
Hey there.

341
00:32:56,206 --> 00:32:56,939
Come on.

342
00:32:57,238 --> 00:32:58,309
Let's go home.

343
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,476
You've still got a cold, remember?

344
00:33:03,198 --> 00:33:04,447
I can't go back.

345
00:33:05,946 --> 00:33:09,533
The stuff in that vial, it wasn't a poison.

346
00:33:10,224 --> 00:33:13,256
It's more like an elixir that
sort of heightens the senses.

347
00:33:14,116 --> 00:33:18,173
Just a few drops... that's all it
took for me to completely lose control,

348
00:33:18,237 --> 00:33:20,102
and I ended up hurting you.

349
00:33:20,682 --> 00:33:22,041
You didn't hurt me at all.

350
00:33:22,264 --> 00:33:24,786
Just look at me. I'm fine, aren't I?

351
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,775
I'm the Matou family mage,

352
00:33:28,819 --> 00:33:30,717
and I've been hiding that from you.

353
00:33:31,745 --> 00:33:32,917
I did the same.

354
00:33:33,118 --> 00:33:34,681
I'm a master, after all,

355
00:33:34,706 --> 00:33:36,097
and I didn't tell you.

356
00:33:36,555 --> 00:33:41,519
The reason I spent so much time at your house
was 'cause I was too scared to stand up to my grandfather!

357
00:33:41,584 --> 00:33:45,769
I said I was there to help you
but I was lying the whole time!

358
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:53,698
All this time, I've always known the truth,

359
00:33:54,276 --> 00:33:57,451
that I'm not the kind of person
who deserves to be by your side.

360
00:33:58,594 --> 00:34:01,173
So every day I kept on telling myself,

361
00:34:01,546 --> 00:34:04,910
Starting tomorrow I'll pretend
I don't even know him, and...

362
00:34:06,283 --> 00:34:08,963
I'll ignore him when we pass each other in the halls,

363
00:34:09,511 --> 00:34:13,274
and after school I'll act like he's a complete stranger.

364
00:34:13,299 --> 00:34:15,511
I'll just walk back home all by myself

365
00:34:16,552 --> 00:34:19,020
and I'll forget about everything... all of it.

366
00:34:22,424 --> 00:34:24,562
But I couldn't make myself do that!

367
00:34:24,893 --> 00:34:28,615
It was more terrifying to me than
the time I put a knife to my wrist.

368
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:30,862
I was scared of lying to you

369
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:33,506
but I was also scared of telling you the truth.

370
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,813
Everything in my life was so scary!

371
00:34:38,529 --> 00:34:41,043
I couldn't take a single step forward.

372
00:34:41,917 --> 00:34:44,360
I didn't have any idea what to do!

373
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,818
And I didn't wanna give up my time with you.

374
00:34:50,036 --> 00:34:52,448
That idea was what scared me most of all.

375
00:34:53,885 --> 00:34:55,051
Because for me...

376
00:34:55,846 --> 00:34:58,195
for me, that was the only thing I had.

377
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,321
The only thing that held any meaning to me.

378
00:35:11,082 --> 00:35:12,956
Someone I want to protect.

379
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,707
Someone who's dear to me.

380
00:35:17,861 --> 00:35:20,883
I'll do whatever I can to dry her tears.

381
00:35:23,064 --> 00:35:26,239
Since nobody else will punish her when she's in the wrong,

382
00:35:26,637 --> 00:35:29,328
she has to do it herself in order to atone.

383
00:35:31,035 --> 00:35:32,880
But I'll take her by the hand

384
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:36,003
and I will lead her out of the darkness.

385
00:35:37,932 --> 00:35:40,420
Even if no one will forgive her, I will.

386
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:48,813
It's okay.

387
00:35:49,992 --> 00:35:51,485
If you won't forgive yourself,

388
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,466
I'll do it for the both of us.

389
00:35:55,413 --> 00:35:56,946
So quit your crying.

390
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,356
I know all your terrible secrets now

391
00:36:00,403 --> 00:36:01,793
and I'm still here.

392
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:06,455
That's not enough.

393
00:36:07,024 --> 00:36:09,965
What happens when I lose control of myself again?

394
00:36:10,778 --> 00:36:13,544
Next time I might do something I can't take back.

395
00:36:14,278 --> 00:36:15,824
So where can I go?

396
00:36:15,901 --> 00:36:17,960
Where does someone like me belong?

397
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:26,960
This is your home, Sakura.

398
00:36:27,387 --> 00:36:28,412
Always.

399
00:36:36,563 --> 00:36:37,528
I can't.

400
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:39,776
Because I...

401
00:36:41,142 --> 00:36:43,047
I'm not a virgin, Shirou.

402
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:48,737
The first time it happened was a long while ago.

403
00:36:50,187 --> 00:36:51,708
But it didn't stop there.

404
00:36:52,474 --> 00:36:53,685
Ever since then,

405
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:57,363
I've been constantly violated by things I can't explain.

406
00:36:58,054 --> 00:37:00,509
I don't deserve your protection!

407
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:11,479
But you'll get it, no matter the circumstances,

408
00:37:11,752 --> 00:37:14,608
even if I have to stop you from taking your own life.

409
00:37:15,202 --> 00:37:17,862
I'll protect you, Sakura.

410
00:37:21,965 --> 00:37:23,032
Shirou.

411
00:37:27,504 --> 00:37:31,819
I will become a hero of justice for you alone.

412
00:37:35,463 --> 00:37:36,781
You can't do that.

413
00:37:38,528 --> 00:37:39,673
If you do,

414
00:37:39,794 --> 00:37:42,140
then I'm going to end up hurting you.

415
00:37:45,381 --> 00:37:46,984
I'll hurt you in the end.

416
00:37:57,059 --> 00:37:58,004
Let's go home.

417
00:38:16,898 --> 00:38:18,174
Hello, Sakura.

418
00:38:20,686 --> 00:38:21,610
big sister?

419
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,960
I mean, Tohsaka.

420
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:51,199
Shirou Emiya.

421
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:55,659
If you're going to keep on sticking to your beliefs,

422
00:38:55,818 --> 00:38:56,715
that's fine.

423
00:38:57,633 --> 00:38:59,421
The results should be obvious.

424
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:03,921
However, if you stray onto a different path,

425
00:39:04,124 --> 00:39:06,608
Shirou Emiya will have no future.

426
00:39:07,976 --> 00:39:11,294
Make that mistake and you'll lose everything.

427
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:27,821
You must be tired.

428
00:39:28,205 --> 00:39:29,658
Why don't you get some rest?

429
00:39:30,086 --> 00:39:32,292
Uh, okay.

430
00:39:34,195 --> 00:39:35,111
What's wrong?

431
00:39:35,555 --> 00:39:36,417
Sakura?

432
00:39:36,972 --> 00:39:38,709
You don't have a fever, do you?

433
00:39:39,132 --> 00:39:41,267
You were out in the rain a long time.

434
00:39:42,228 --> 00:39:43,523
No, it's not that.

435
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,341
I don't have a cold.

436
00:39:46,129 --> 00:39:50,042
It's just that my mana is running a bit low.

437
00:39:51,446 --> 00:39:52,306
Oh.

438
00:39:52,914 --> 00:39:56,254
Well, is there anything that I can do?

439
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,228
I don't know.

440
00:40:01,351 --> 00:40:02,399
I guess...

441
00:40:03,765 --> 00:40:05,200
Do you want to...

442
00:40:07,176 --> 00:40:09,024
Never mind. I'll be fine.

443
00:40:09,049 --> 00:40:11,867
If you could just let me drink a little bit of your blood?

444
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:14,453
Uh, sure.

445
00:40:17,928 --> 00:40:19,214
Will that be enough?

446
00:40:20,609 --> 00:40:21,515
Yes.

447
00:40:48,754 --> 00:40:50,754
DO you feel better?

448
00:40:58,468 --> 00:41:00,642
Okay, that's good.

449
00:41:01,134 --> 00:41:03,468
So, um, goodnight.

450
00:41:05,033 --> 00:41:05,713
Night.

451
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:20,196
I can't. I've gone too far already.

452
00:41:22,044 --> 00:41:24,196
I can't corrupt him like that.

453
00:41:51,532 --> 00:41:54,211
Sakura, can you start the soup stock?

454
00:41:54,592 --> 00:41:55,480
Of course.

455
00:41:56,798 --> 00:41:58,932
What about the spinach? Can I help with that?

456
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:01,281
I say we dress it with sesame today.

457
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,985
All right, pass me some eggs.

458
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:04,813
Here.

459
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:12,916
Thank you for the food.

460
00:42:18,685 --> 00:42:19,745
This is nice.

461
00:42:19,976 --> 00:42:21,804
It's been a while since we cooked together.

462
00:42:22,868 --> 00:42:23,624
Yeah.

463
00:42:27,856 --> 00:42:28,973
Go ahead and eat.

464
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,911
It's okay. There's no need to be shy.

465
00:42:34,949 --> 00:42:36,140
No, thank you.

466
00:42:36,211 --> 00:42:39,227
Servants do not require nutrients like you do.

467
00:42:40,072 --> 00:42:40,963
Oh, really?

468
00:42:41,426 --> 00:42:43,425
Saber ate food with us all the time.

469
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:49,432
I'm not suited for mannerisms such as these.

470
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:51,755
Oh, I get it.

471
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:53,754
No problem.

472
00:43:05,174 --> 00:43:06,547
Let's talk strategy.

473
00:43:07,467 --> 00:43:09,139
I'm gonna help Sakura win,

474
00:43:09,682 --> 00:43:11,396
so she can use the Grail.

475
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:15,869
Sakura, I think it's best if you stay inside till then.

476
00:43:16,483 --> 00:43:17,874
It's too dangerous.

477
00:43:17,967 --> 00:43:19,513
You could run into Zouken.

478
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:22,745
I'm inclined to agree.

479
00:43:23,419 --> 00:43:27,800
That said, how do you intend to
defeat a powerful mage such as him?

480
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:33,419
I think we should work with the
other masters, if they're willing.

481
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,654
But who?

482
00:43:35,709 --> 00:43:37,746
Who else is even left at this point?

483
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:42,333
Tohsaka and Archer, Sakura and Rider,

484
00:43:43,191 --> 00:43:45,627
Zouken's still got Assassin working for him,

485
00:43:46,891 --> 00:43:50,952
then there's Illya and Berserker.

486
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,476
Are you sure it's all right?

487
00:43:59,038 --> 00:43:59,636
Yeah.

488
00:44:00,827 --> 00:44:03,676
But, uh, make sure you stay inside the house, okay?

489
00:44:11,516 --> 00:44:13,301
You're not regretting this, are you?

490
00:44:15,738 --> 00:44:17,279
I can't have regrets.

491
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:19,187
I've come too far for that.

492
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:25,162
Rider, if things get too dangerous
out there, bring Shirou home.

493
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,848
You know, Sakura...

494
00:44:29,388 --> 00:44:31,677
It's fine to be wary of the old man,

495
00:44:32,122 --> 00:44:35,547
but I think the one we really
need to worry about is that priest.

496
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:40,886
Oh, yes. He is a problem.

497
00:44:41,186 --> 00:44:43,003
I won't argue with you on that.

498
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,643
Although, there's nothing to be afraid of,

499
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:49,336
because no matter what,

500
00:44:50,209 --> 00:44:52,147
he'll never be able to beat me.

501
00:44:55,739 --> 00:44:56,401
Good.

502
00:45:41,943 --> 00:45:43,003
Shirou!

503
00:46:04,878 --> 00:46:05,981
I got it.

504
00:46:06,237 --> 00:46:08,373
I just had to keep him here all the time.

505
00:46:09,182 --> 00:46:10,507
If he can't leave,

506
00:46:10,595 --> 00:46:13,444
then he won't ever be in danger anymore, will he?

507
00:46:16,955 --> 00:46:19,385
That's weird. What did I just...

508
00:46:20,036 --> 00:46:21,528
I can't remember.

509
00:46:47,758 --> 00:46:50,383
This is tougher than I thought.

510
00:46:59,732 --> 00:47:02,057
Does it want me to follow it?

511
00:47:15,811 --> 00:47:17,223
Where'd it go?

512
00:47:23,678 --> 00:47:25,380
Why'd it stop here?

513
00:48:09,168 --> 00:48:11,023
You're as cowardly as your master.

514
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,265
That makes you the perfect pair.

515
00:48:13,904 --> 00:48:16,848
It feels as though you have no intention of fighting us.

516
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:21,303
Do you really value your life that much?

517
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:25,400
Yes. I thought that was obvious.

518
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,986
My only desire is immortality.

519
00:48:30,065 --> 00:48:32,271
Just look at this body.

520
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:36,263
I'm a walking corpse-rotting, stinking...

521
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:39,644
and my mind is slowly deteriorating along with it.

522
00:48:40,323 --> 00:48:46,318
You can't even begin to comprehend the indescribable
pain of decomposing while you're still breathing.

523
00:48:47,636 --> 00:48:51,423
There's no human in existence who doesn't fear death.

524
00:48:54,748 --> 00:48:58,935
If it meant I'd be given eternal
life without all this pain...

525
00:49:00,534 --> 00:49:03,939
I'd gladly kill every single person on this planet

526
00:49:03,964 --> 00:49:05,484
one by one.

527
00:49:12,217 --> 00:49:13,909
I'm disgusted by you.

528
00:49:14,678 --> 00:49:17,146
Have you really lost yourself that much...

529
00:49:18,313 --> 00:49:19,186
Makiri?

530
00:49:20,226 --> 00:49:23,335
Don't you remember what our greatest desire used to be?

531
00:49:23,906 --> 00:49:27,595
Don't you remember the miracle we
were fighting so hard to achieve?

532
00:49:28,574 --> 00:49:30,432
Remember what it was all for.

533
00:49:30,748 --> 00:49:34,026
Why did we strive to attain these inhuman capabilities

534
00:49:34,066 --> 00:49:36,305
without giving up our human bodies?

535
00:49:41,163 --> 00:49:44,397
That's quite the speech, coming from a mere puppet.

536
00:49:44,711 --> 00:49:48,392
They taught you how to imitate your ancestors very well.

537
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:52,813
But I'm afraid play time is over.

538
00:49:53,013 --> 00:49:58,578
Now I... Zouken Matou-will finally
claim the Einzbern's Holy Grail.

539
00:50:29,469 --> 00:50:31,746
No! Berserker!

540
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:57,227
Tohsaka.

541
00:50:57,564 --> 00:50:58,303
How did...

542
00:50:59,041 --> 00:51:02,684
Oh Emiya, I never thought you'd
come up with the same idea as me.

543
00:51:30,526 --> 00:51:31,660
Impossible!

544
00:51:50,621 --> 00:51:52,178
You have to get out of there!

545
00:51:52,353 --> 00:51:55,282
If that thing gets you, you'll never be able to come back!

546
00:52:08,657 --> 00:52:10,640
The score has been settled.

547
00:52:11,093 --> 00:52:12,949
I'm leaving the rest to you.

548
00:52:13,007 --> 00:52:14,929
Don't let all this effort go to waste.

549
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,491
Take care of the Einzbern girl.

550
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:29,774
Berserker!

551
00:52:39,006 --> 00:52:39,745
Illya!

552
00:52:55,127 --> 00:52:57,390
You're a dick, you know that?

553
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,827
Berserker.

554
00:53:15,666 --> 00:53:17,109
I'm your opponent.

555
00:53:17,492 --> 00:53:18,777
Leave them out of it.

556
00:53:25,558 --> 00:53:26,312
Archer.

557
00:53:28,894 --> 00:53:30,013
I'm counting on you.

558
00:54:00,518 --> 00:54:01,335
It's over.

559
00:54:09,823 --> 00:54:11,623
A Cursed Boundary Layer.

560
00:54:12,258 --> 00:54:14,775
No heroic spirit could fight that,

561
00:54:15,345 --> 00:54:17,275
which means that at this point,

562
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:20,521
you're no more than the weak phantoms of this forest.

563
00:54:41,059 --> 00:54:42,439
Berserker!

564
00:54:51,049 --> 00:54:52,073
This isn't good.

565
00:54:53,956 --> 00:54:55,025
Berserker.

566
00:54:56,272 --> 00:54:56,930
No!

567
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:01,053
Berserker!

568
00:58:49,631 --> 00:58:50,782
It can't be.

569
00:58:51,663 --> 00:58:52,278
No!

570
00:59:30,941 --> 00:59:32,369
My task is complete.

571
00:59:33,242 --> 00:59:34,933
The rest is in your hands.

572
00:59:35,782 --> 00:59:37,084
How generous.

573
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:39,305
I suppose I owe you one.

574
00:59:44,083 --> 00:59:45,880
Saber!

575
01:00:05,703 --> 01:00:06,433
Illya!

576
01:00:21,378 --> 01:00:22,613
That's far enough.

577
01:00:23,171 --> 01:00:25,621
You are unnecessary.

578
01:00:33,342 --> 01:00:36,684
You can't finish off this boy
without resorting to an ambush?

579
01:00:36,748 --> 01:00:37,995
So pathetic.

580
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:41,869
You again?

581
01:00:41,963 --> 01:00:43,824
How are you still standing?

582
01:00:44,369 --> 01:00:45,376
Who's to say?

583
01:00:45,686 --> 01:00:46,684
Archer!

584
01:00:48,454 --> 01:00:49,358
Get moving!

585
01:00:50,516 --> 01:00:52,481
If that thing catches you, it's over.

586
01:01:02,071 --> 01:01:03,308
We can talk later.

587
01:01:03,452 --> 01:01:04,602
Now get out of here!

588
01:01:05,444 --> 01:01:07,571
You decided to take Illya's hand.

589
01:01:07,724 --> 01:01:09,311
Keep her safe until the end.

590
01:01:17,737 --> 01:01:18,431
Let's go.

591
01:01:40,228 --> 01:01:40,879
How?

592
01:01:42,212 --> 01:01:43,908
How can you still move?

593
01:01:45,974 --> 01:01:47,328
Isn't that obvious?

594
01:01:48,013 --> 01:01:51,958
The thing is, I'm not a legitimate
heroic spirit like the rest,

595
01:01:52,323 --> 01:01:54,282
and since I'm not pure like them,

596
01:01:54,307 --> 01:01:56,759
a little corruption doesn't affect me as much.

597
01:01:56,806 --> 01:02:01,175
In other words, I'm a heroic
spirit as twisted as that shadow!

598
01:02:23,037 --> 01:02:24,839
That was fantastic, Archer.

599
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:27,410
You can return to spirit form.

600
01:02:27,822 --> 01:02:29,585
Now, let's hurry up and get going.

601
01:02:30,754 --> 01:02:31,404
Look out!

602
01:02:39,918 --> 01:02:40,654
Oh, no.

603
01:02:43,981 --> 01:02:45,045
Archer!

604
01:02:49,072 --> 01:02:50,064
You can't!

605
01:02:52,842 --> 01:02:55,855
Hurry up and get out of here, morons.

606
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,201
It's an incredible amount of energy!

607
01:03:09,665 --> 01:03:10,786
This is real bad!

608
01:03:14,395 --> 01:03:15,882
Tohsaka, run!

609
01:03:24,603 --> 01:03:29,277
I am the bone of my sword.

610
01:03:29,738 --> 01:03:31,951
Steel is my body.

611
01:03:33,666 --> 01:03:38,182
I have created over 1,000 blades.

612
01:03:44,527 --> 01:03:47,205
Rho Aias.

613
01:04:28,719 --> 01:04:29,481
Shirou.

614
01:04:32,951 --> 01:04:34,703
No. No, please!

615
01:04:35,466 --> 01:04:37,123
S... Shirou!

616
01:04:39,999 --> 01:04:40,793
Shirou.

617
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,134
Shirou!

618
01:04:49,736 --> 01:04:51,070
Guess this is the end.

619
01:04:55,022 --> 01:04:57,852
Take care, Tohsaka.

620
01:05:17,319 --> 01:05:18,706
Have you gone mad?

621
01:05:23,922 --> 01:05:26,364
Do you know what will happen to you if you do that?

622
01:05:28,222 --> 01:05:29,960
There's nothing to think about.

623
01:05:30,436 --> 01:05:31,721
If I do nothing,

624
01:05:31,746 --> 01:05:33,512
there'll be two bodies to bury.

625
01:05:34,238 --> 01:05:37,349
This way, at least one of them will survive.

626
01:05:50,967 --> 01:05:52,948
I'm home, Sakura.

627
01:05:54,515 --> 01:05:55,983
Oh, yeah. My arm.

628
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:58,329
You don't need to worry about it. It's nothing,

629
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:01,522
Okay? It's just a scratch, really.

630
01:06:02,496 --> 01:06:05,162
I know it looks bad because of all the bandages

631
01:06:05,377 --> 01:06:06,854
but it's not that big a deal.

632
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:08,428
Honestly, I promise.

633
01:06:11,903 --> 01:06:14,760
Oh, while I was out, I ran into Tohsaka.

634
01:06:15,292 --> 01:06:16,511
She gave me a hand.

635
01:06:16,653 --> 01:06:18,224
We've agreed to a ceasefire.

636
01:06:19,534 --> 01:06:21,534
Oh, and this is Illya.

637
01:06:22,276 --> 01:06:24,563
I'm sorry to surprise you with company, but...

638
01:06:26,193 --> 01:06:27,024
Sakura?

639
01:06:32,318 --> 01:06:33,739
Can you move that arm?

640
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:35,741
No.

641
01:06:36,215 --> 01:06:37,493
Figured as much.

642
01:06:37,799 --> 01:06:41,830
Transplanting a limb from a
servant to a human is unheard of.

643
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:47,268
Shirou, if you do move that arm even once,

644
01:06:47,355 --> 01:06:49,428
Archer's magic circuits will activate,

645
01:06:50,127 --> 01:06:51,905
but your body won't handle it.

646
01:06:52,055 --> 01:06:53,642
The power will overwhelm you,

647
01:06:53,857 --> 01:06:55,809
and you'll collapse from the inside.

648
01:06:57,952 --> 01:07:00,117
So then, these bandages...

649
01:07:00,601 --> 01:07:01,809
They're a seal.

650
01:07:05,109 --> 01:07:07,685
Thank you for everything.

651
01:07:08,783 --> 01:07:10,940
W...What are you thanking me for?

652
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:15,471
I'm only here because we're
working together to defeat Zouken

653
01:07:16,114 --> 01:07:19,788
and because it's convenient for me to keep her close by.

654
01:07:22,003 --> 01:07:23,330
Just as I thought.

655
01:07:23,685 --> 01:07:25,415
You're worried about Sakura, too.

656
01:07:26,185 --> 01:07:27,874
I'm telling you, that's not it.

657
01:07:29,296 --> 01:07:32,005
Besides, if I hadn't become a master myself,

658
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:35,175
we probably never would have even
known each other in the first place.

659
01:07:37,195 --> 01:07:40,186
Hmm. Actually, you'd be surprised.

660
01:07:41,854 --> 01:07:43,433
If I'm being completely honest,

661
01:07:43,576 --> 01:07:45,185
you may not have noticed me,

662
01:07:45,592 --> 01:07:48,155
but I've known about you for quite a while now.

663
01:07:50,404 --> 01:07:52,568
I think it was about four years ago.

664
01:07:53,007 --> 01:07:57,704
Anyway, this boy kept trying to do
the high jump over and over until sunset.

665
01:07:58,190 --> 01:08:00,590
I happened to walk by.

666
01:08:02,743 --> 01:08:06,206
Clearly, the idiot was never going
to pull it off, but he kept jumping,

667
01:08:06,634 --> 01:08:09,251
and I was the bigger idiot 'cause I kept watching.

668
01:08:10,134 --> 01:08:13,315
Personally, when I realize what
I'm trying to do is impossible,

669
01:08:13,473 --> 01:08:15,266
I accept it and give up.

670
01:08:15,981 --> 01:08:17,760
I guess I'm just cold like that.

671
01:08:18,853 --> 01:08:21,442
But then again, mages always are.

672
01:08:21,875 --> 01:08:24,550
I'd always dismiss it. Oh, well, it's fine.

673
01:08:24,575 --> 01:08:26,433
I didn't need that impossible thing.

674
01:08:26,798 --> 01:08:30,105
But then I saw someone who
seemed to be exactly the opposite.

675
01:08:30,686 --> 01:08:32,349
It was an eye-opener for me.

676
01:08:50,476 --> 01:08:51,872
Don't take that, too.

677
01:08:55,492 --> 01:08:56,965
That's my memory.

678
01:08:58,092 --> 01:08:59,301
Don't take it.

679
01:09:25,808 --> 01:09:30,207
Maybe if I take this off, my arm will be back to normal.

680
01:09:52,839 --> 01:09:53,856
Holy shit.

681
01:09:55,005 --> 01:09:55,858
This is...

682
01:09:58,887 --> 01:10:00,112
This isn't good.

683
01:10:09,314 --> 01:10:10,038
Shirou.

684
01:10:13,568 --> 01:10:14,600
We need to talk.

685
01:10:14,901 --> 01:10:16,536
I have a question for you.

686
01:10:18,211 --> 01:10:23,240
It seems Sakura's happiness depends
entirely upon having you by her side.

687
01:10:23,668 --> 01:10:26,930
That is all she wants and wishes for nothing else.

688
01:10:27,533 --> 01:10:30,768
My wish is for her continued survival.

689
01:10:31,948 --> 01:10:34,694
Truthfully, I'm rather fond of her.

690
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:43,699
Shirou, can you tell me you're on Sakura's side?

691
01:10:46,001 --> 01:10:49,318
And will you stay there no matter what comes to pass?

692
01:10:54,588 --> 01:10:55,334
Shirou.

693
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:00,295
Sakura?

694
01:11:05,077 --> 01:11:08,073
Oh, yeah. You're running low on mana, huh?

695
01:11:08,399 --> 01:11:09,947
Okay, come on in.

696
01:11:11,415 --> 01:11:12,565
Let's see.

697
01:11:12,661 --> 01:11:14,784
Where did I leave that box cutter?

698
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,100
Um, Sakura?

699
01:11:49,233 --> 01:11:50,616
Tell me, Shirou.

700
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:52,267
I need to know.

701
01:11:52,804 --> 01:11:55,060
Why are you trying to protect me?

702
01:11:57,690 --> 01:11:58,660
Because I...

703
01:12:01,336 --> 01:12:04,518
I belong with you. I wanna be by your side.

704
01:12:06,074 --> 01:12:08,383
I'm protecting you 'cause I need you.

705
01:12:09,653 --> 01:12:13,093
Life without you isn't something I can imagine.

706
01:12:15,105 --> 01:12:18,041
Do you mean I'm like family to you?

707
01:12:19,075 --> 01:12:24,168
Or do you mean you wanna be with me as a girl?

708
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:33,847
Sakura, what I mean is I'm in love with you.

709
01:12:39,572 --> 01:12:42,316
Then make love to me.

710
01:12:50,421 --> 01:12:55,287
Or maybe... maybe I'm too impure for you.

711
01:12:56,833 --> 01:12:59,708
Just look at me. I know I am.

712
01:13:01,095 --> 01:13:04,897
I simply step inside your room
and I'm overwhelmed with desire.

713
01:13:05,174 --> 01:13:06,465
What's wrong with me?

714
01:13:07,610 --> 01:13:11,507
Even when I'm by myself, I can't stop wanting this.

715
01:13:12,372 --> 01:13:15,933
I... I can't think of anything but you, Shirou.

716
01:13:17,447 --> 01:13:20,254
I'm so... so disgusting.

717
01:13:24,577 --> 01:13:25,569
No, you're not.

718
01:13:26,355 --> 01:13:28,153
You're not disgusting at all.

719
01:13:29,879 --> 01:13:31,411
You're beautiful, Sakura.

720
01:13:33,982 --> 01:13:35,241
Oh, Shirou.

721
01:14:04,697 --> 01:14:07,689
I... I couldn't take it.

722
01:14:08,419 --> 01:14:09,945
I got so scared.

723
01:14:10,292 --> 01:14:12,720
When big sister was alone with you, I thought...

724
01:14:13,355 --> 01:14:16,363
I was afraid she was gonna take you away from me.

725
01:14:33,013 --> 01:14:34,672
I didn't mean to hurt you.

726
01:14:35,351 --> 01:14:36,474
I'm sorry.

727
01:14:43,235 --> 01:14:44,219
Shirou.

728
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,578
Sakura.

729
01:15:06,115 --> 01:15:09,266
I love you, Shirou. So much.

730
01:15:18,702 --> 01:15:20,313
It's time for a blessing.

731
01:15:21,733 --> 01:15:22,736
A blessing?

732
01:15:25,971 --> 01:15:27,130
What do you mean?

733
01:15:28,344 --> 01:15:31,002
Another Holy Grail is just about to be born,

734
01:15:31,431 --> 01:15:32,944
and I welcome it.

735
01:15:33,423 --> 01:15:37,829
That vessel which is responsible for
creating all the evils in the world,

736
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:41,536
forged by humanity, yet desired by none.

737
01:15:42,829 --> 01:15:44,915
So why should it even exist?

738
01:15:45,462 --> 01:15:47,247
If the grail has the answer,

739
01:15:47,272 --> 01:15:50,829
why not search for it instead
of looking for the answer myself?

740
01:15:50,869 --> 01:15:51,798
See what I mean?

741
01:15:56,083 --> 01:15:58,179
Soon I will know the truth,

742
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:02,390
and if God himself should
consider this question blasphemy,

743
01:16:03,694 --> 01:16:07,306
then I shall stand before him and ask it once again.

744
01:16:08,417 --> 01:16:11,274
For I will give up my soul, if I must.

745
01:16:18,413 --> 01:16:20,006
Since you're letting me stay here,

746
01:16:20,031 --> 01:16:22,265
the least I can do is make us all breakfast.

747
01:16:30,476 --> 01:16:32,317
Um, excuse me.

748
01:16:32,356 --> 01:16:34,762
I'm gonna see if Tohsaka needs any help.

749
01:16:35,321 --> 01:16:36,925
Uh, hey, Sakura?

750
01:16:38,650 --> 01:16:39,469
Yes?

751
01:16:40,333 --> 01:16:42,562
If you want, with Tohsaka?

752
01:16:43,213 --> 01:16:45,872
I wonder, what should I make today?

753
01:16:50,396 --> 01:16:53,817
Hey, Sis. I'll wash the vegetables, okay?

754
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:58,155
Okay, thanks. That, um...

755
01:17:04,268 --> 01:17:08,375
Is it too weird being around me like this, big sister?

756
01:17:11,998 --> 01:17:14,273
No, there's nothing weird about it at all.

757
01:17:22,902 --> 01:17:24,750
You know, Illya, I was thinking,

758
01:17:24,902 --> 01:17:27,243
do you think that my room would be a good place?

759
01:17:28,584 --> 01:17:30,228
What are you talking about?

760
01:17:30,791 --> 01:17:31,978
Secret weapons.

761
01:17:32,058 --> 01:17:35,183
I thought we might need to have
one or two of them up our sleeves.

762
01:17:36,137 --> 01:17:37,756
That arm has memories.

763
01:17:37,796 --> 01:17:40,322
It contains knowledge about the Einzberns.

764
01:17:41,407 --> 01:17:45,899
I suggested to Tohsaka there might be
something useful inside that could be worth a look.

765
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,811
I personally have no interest in
what Kischur Zelretch left behind.

766
01:17:53,343 --> 01:17:56,430
Then again, it's possible his so-called treasure chest

767
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:57,985
might be pretty.

768
01:18:01,092 --> 01:18:02,850
That was weird.

769
01:18:04,443 --> 01:18:05,403
Shirou?

770
01:18:07,744 --> 01:18:11,910
I just, um... thank you. Thank you so much.

771
01:18:14,609 --> 01:18:17,692
I've only ever been able to watch her from a distance.

772
01:18:18,164 --> 01:18:22,855
Never in my wildest dreams did I think there'd be a day
when I could call her big sister.

773
01:18:24,403 --> 01:18:29,022
So you didn't have any interaction with
her at all after the Matou family adopted you?

774
01:18:29,862 --> 01:18:30,624
None.

775
01:18:31,378 --> 01:18:33,068
We knew we were sisters,

776
01:18:33,243 --> 01:18:34,790
but only as a concept.

777
01:18:35,076 --> 01:18:37,521
It wasn't really real for either of us.

778
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:41,140
In fact, we tried our best to
avoid each other most of the time.

779
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:47,068
I was afraid if she ever found out about my Magecraft,

780
01:18:47,441 --> 01:18:48,997
she was going to hate me.

781
01:18:50,413 --> 01:18:53,382
Why would she hate you for magic?

782
01:18:57,441 --> 01:18:59,520
Because of the Matou technique.

783
01:18:59,869 --> 01:19:03,019
It's entirely based on stealing from others.

784
01:19:04,051 --> 01:19:05,234
That's all we do,

785
01:19:05,631 --> 01:19:08,115
and we never give anything back in return.

786
01:19:10,107 --> 01:19:14,250
Sakura, do you hate the Matou's Magecraft?

787
01:19:15,321 --> 01:19:18,519
I don't know. The teachings were certainly strict,

788
01:19:19,424 --> 01:19:23,124
though compared to you, I think
my training's a walk in the park.

789
01:19:24,372 --> 01:19:25,793
I watched you one night.

790
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:29,777
You were working so hard. You kept on pushing yourself.

791
01:19:31,832 --> 01:19:35,645
There were so many moments I thought I
should do something to try to stop you.

792
01:19:37,849 --> 01:19:39,690
Your workout looked dangerous.

793
01:19:39,858 --> 01:19:41,540
It was making me nervous.

794
01:19:42,235 --> 01:19:45,794
It was like... like you were stabbing your own throat.

795
01:19:46,008 --> 01:19:47,120
That's how it looked.

796
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:51,369
Even though no one was there telling you to do it,

797
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:55,707
you just kept on going and you were all by yourself.

798
01:19:57,367 --> 01:19:59,926
That's why out of all of us,

799
01:20:00,336 --> 01:20:02,297
I'm sure you're the strongest.

800
01:20:03,622 --> 01:20:05,717
It has nothing to do with Magecraft.

801
01:20:06,447 --> 01:20:09,213
It's because you're so determined and pure at heart.

802
01:20:20,026 --> 01:20:23,154
I've always known since the first day we met...

803
01:20:24,527 --> 01:20:26,312
That no matter what happened,

804
01:20:26,915 --> 01:20:29,891
Shirou Emiya would never betray anyone.

805
01:20:36,295 --> 01:20:38,001
You bastard!

806
01:20:38,031 --> 01:20:41,252
This is all your fault, Emiya!

807
01:21:04,869 --> 01:21:05,643
Why?

808
01:21:06,336 --> 01:21:10,312
Why won't... why won't anything happen?

809
01:21:24,939 --> 01:21:26,843
And now for our top story.

810
01:21:26,899 --> 01:21:31,430
The bodies of four possible murder victims were
found in Central Park in the New City District tonight.

811
01:21:31,455 --> 01:21:32,294
Look at that.

812
01:21:33,287 --> 01:21:35,358
Some of these weeds have turned black.

813
01:21:36,130 --> 01:21:38,879
That means the shadow did this.

814
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,943
Do you think Zouken's controlling it?

815
01:21:41,674 --> 01:21:42,605
I don't know.

816
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:45,733
I doubt Zouken would leave evidence like this behind.

817
01:21:56,498 --> 01:21:58,402
I can't taste anything.

818
01:22:05,648 --> 01:22:07,130
He's so warm.

819
01:22:08,854 --> 01:22:10,021
It's all right.

820
01:22:10,299 --> 01:22:12,084
I can still feel this.

821
01:22:14,695 --> 01:22:18,728
I wish this moment would last forever.

822
01:22:59,259 --> 01:23:01,142
Flip flop and off I go.

823
01:23:02,095 --> 01:23:04,437
My clear head sways to and fro.

824
01:23:05,008 --> 01:23:07,795
Bless what the nitty-gritty in this beautiful meadow.

825
01:23:09,247 --> 01:23:11,792
A shiver and a tremble and a big go, go.

826
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:15,490
A song and a giggle and a big go, go.

827
01:23:16,769 --> 01:23:19,579
Like paper balloons, my limbs roll around.

828
01:23:20,165 --> 01:23:23,069
Just tumbling and tumbling across the ground.

829
01:23:24,029 --> 01:23:26,397
Huff and puff, away I'm blown.

830
01:23:26,562 --> 01:23:28,426
That's when I'll be fully grown.

831
01:23:28,936 --> 01:23:35,192
Go, go. Go, go. Go, go.

832
01:24:03,101 --> 01:24:05,626
Squeak, squeaking voices come for me.

833
01:24:06,868 --> 01:24:09,387
Cackle, cackle, cackling full of glee.

834
01:24:10,151 --> 01:24:11,309
I don't like them.

835
01:24:11,352 --> 01:24:12,439
What's so funny?

836
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:33,733
Skritch, scratch, they're far too loud.

837
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:44,985
My tummy rumble grumbles for a candy cloud.

838
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:54,380
You're working hard, huh?

839
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:58,765
I told you you should die before it's too late.

840
01:25:12,495 --> 01:25:15,101
Twinkle, twinkle. So pretty.

841
01:25:27,235 --> 01:25:29,092
Your grace period is over,

842
01:25:29,950 --> 01:25:32,206
and trust me, this is mercy.

843
01:25:53,811 --> 01:25:56,818
Oh? You're still breathing, huh?

844
01:25:57,914 --> 01:26:01,787
It seems your shadow isn't the
only thing about you that's changed.

845
01:26:31,523 --> 01:26:34,373
Did you honestly think you could make me kneel for you?

846
01:27:07,972 --> 01:27:09,092
Damn you!

847
01:27:29,604 --> 01:27:30,863
I can't believe it.

848
01:27:31,516 --> 01:27:32,705
You've gotten it.

849
01:28:04,797 --> 01:28:05,978
Did you see that?

850
01:28:32,359 --> 01:28:33,121
Shirou!

851
01:28:35,675 --> 01:28:36,970
Get up and come with me.

852
01:28:43,326 --> 01:28:45,008
It happened around 10:30 tonight.

853
01:28:45,239 --> 01:28:48,184
A wide-spread blackout centered
around the New City Station.

854
01:28:48,983 --> 01:28:53,926
We're told the police have received multiple
incomprehensible reports about neighbors disappearing,

855
01:28:53,974 --> 01:28:57,648
missing family members and people
suddenly and inexplicably vanishing.

856
01:29:06,101 --> 01:29:06,799
Sakura!

857
01:29:08,188 --> 01:29:08,902
Hang on.

858
01:29:09,077 --> 01:29:10,511
I'll go get the first aid kit.

859
01:29:11,704 --> 01:29:12,302
Saku...

860
01:29:17,442 --> 01:29:18,680
Just ignore it.

861
01:29:20,330 --> 01:29:21,362
Don't look.

862
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:32,838
Don't even think about how much it looks like her.

863
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:39,973
This morning the body count continues to rise,
now totaling over 60.

864
01:29:40,774 --> 01:29:45,630
No estimate yet for how many have gone missing,
but roughly 40 buildings were effected.

865
01:29:48,649 --> 01:29:49,675
How's Sakura?

866
01:29:51,704 --> 01:29:52,833
She's alive.

867
01:29:56,817 --> 01:29:57,767
At least.

868
01:29:58,714 --> 01:30:00,893
What is it? Something wrong?

869
01:30:01,919 --> 01:30:03,246
Sakura's body.

870
01:30:03,502 --> 01:30:05,895
At a glance it appears to look just fine,

871
01:30:06,094 --> 01:30:08,373
but under the surface, her muscles are shredded.

872
01:30:09,301 --> 01:30:10,340
No question.

873
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:12,421
At some point, Sakura was dead.

874
01:30:14,777 --> 01:30:16,904
I don't have any idea who did it to her,

875
01:30:17,388 --> 01:30:21,123
but it's quite possible the pain
destroyed her brain as well as her body.

876
01:30:23,034 --> 01:30:27,148
We need to defeat Zouken and
that shadow as soon as possible.

877
01:30:28,348 --> 01:30:30,777
Let's get ready because we're running out of time.

878
01:30:36,832 --> 01:30:38,943
Shirou, I'm worried.

879
01:30:40,459 --> 01:30:43,355
'Cause what if Zouken and the
shadow aren't what we think they are

880
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:45,632
and are completely separate problems?

881
01:30:46,134 --> 01:30:47,523
What are you going to do then?

882
01:31:01,888 --> 01:31:04,825
Good morning. Am I still talking to Sakura,

883
01:31:05,173 --> 01:31:06,361
or someone else?

884
01:31:08,103 --> 01:31:11,006
Where in the world did you get a soul like that into you?

885
01:31:11,527 --> 01:31:14,051
I know you don't have Assassin or Rider yet,

886
01:31:14,345 --> 01:31:15,678
but you're already full?

887
01:31:16,051 --> 01:31:17,370
That's hard to believe.

888
01:31:22,311 --> 01:31:26,211
Sakura, do you understand what's going to happen to you?

889
01:31:28,752 --> 01:31:29,403
No.

890
01:31:30,141 --> 01:31:32,275
What's going to happen? Tell me.

891
01:31:33,451 --> 01:31:36,574
You will die. Nothing can save you.

892
01:31:47,069 --> 01:31:48,511
I'm back!

893
01:31:48,902 --> 01:31:50,632
Better late than never, huh?

894
01:31:51,243 --> 01:31:53,020
Uh, hey!

895
01:31:53,203 --> 01:31:55,251
Shirou, are you here?

896
01:31:57,211 --> 01:31:58,137
Who's she?

897
01:32:00,139 --> 01:32:02,214
Ah, jeez.

898
01:32:02,790 --> 01:32:05,251
Where the heck has he disappeared to now?

899
01:32:05,790 --> 01:32:08,230
Especially when you're so sick.

900
01:32:11,909 --> 01:32:14,919
Oh! Oh, sweetie, no! Don't hurt yourself.

901
01:32:15,268 --> 01:32:20,766
Shirou said he was going to protect me no matter what.

902
01:32:21,141 --> 01:32:22,101
Oh.

903
01:32:23,108 --> 01:32:23,572
But...

904
01:32:25,762 --> 01:32:26,782
I'm sorry.

905
01:32:28,207 --> 01:32:29,659
But it's all my fault.

906
01:32:30,564 --> 01:32:32,841
His dreams will be shattered 'cause of me.

907
01:32:35,498 --> 01:32:36,696
Why's that?

908
01:32:38,078 --> 01:32:39,807
Because I'm a...

909
01:32:41,014 --> 01:32:43,823
Well, because I'm a bad person.

910
01:32:45,134 --> 01:32:49,690
Even so, you know Shirou will help
you atone and show you how to do better.

911
01:32:51,396 --> 01:32:55,815
Besides, you wanna change all the
bad things about yourself, don't you?

912
01:32:56,519 --> 01:32:57,780
Yes, I do.

913
01:32:59,154 --> 01:33:00,908
Then there's nothing to worry about.

914
01:33:02,207 --> 01:33:05,552
And Shirou's dream is to
become a hero of justice, isn't it?

915
01:33:06,168 --> 01:33:09,083
So it only makes sense there's
someone he wants to protect.

916
01:33:10,564 --> 01:33:14,556
But doesn't that mean he should protect everyone?

917
01:33:14,580 --> 01:33:17,331
Oh no. Not if he's trying to be like Kiritsugu.

918
01:33:17,957 --> 01:33:21,293
In fact, he probably should have someone special.

919
01:33:25,235 --> 01:33:26,908
Kiritsugu played favorites.

920
01:33:26,932 --> 01:33:29,250
I mean, he was only human, after all.

921
01:33:31,355 --> 01:33:33,766
Even once he started calling this place home.

922
01:33:33,870 --> 01:33:37,278
That man did a lot of traveling all the time.

923
01:33:37,513 --> 01:33:39,155
He went overseas a lot.

924
01:33:40,472 --> 01:33:44,442
Right up until he wasn't able to move anymore.

925
01:33:48,286 --> 01:33:51,764
I'm sure it's because there was
someone he desperately wanted to see.

926
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:59,027
Not being able to see someone you care about,

927
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:00,843
it's unbearably painful.

928
01:34:02,043 --> 01:34:03,924
Even for a hero of justice.

929
01:34:08,376 --> 01:34:09,435
So please.

930
01:34:10,769 --> 01:34:13,778
Do him a favor and stay by his side.

931
01:34:13,878 --> 01:34:15,088
All right, Sakura?

932
01:34:33,411 --> 01:34:34,808
Are you a traitor?

933
01:34:42,078 --> 01:34:45,744
Will you betray yourself, who you used to be?

934
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:53,818
Hey.

935
01:34:58,598 --> 01:34:59,605
No, stop.

936
01:35:01,271 --> 01:35:03,113
If that's what you intend to do...

937
01:35:05,121 --> 01:35:06,271
...you've lost.

938
01:35:08,609 --> 01:35:10,802
Leave her alone!

939
01:35:22,285 --> 01:35:22,943
No.

940
01:35:23,896 --> 01:35:24,950
No way.

941
01:35:25,166 --> 01:35:26,325
It can't be.

942
01:35:32,139 --> 01:35:34,893
Shirou Emiya, correct?

943
01:35:36,211 --> 01:35:38,615
My lord mage would like a word.

944
01:35:54,583 --> 01:35:58,083
Well, you're here even sooner than I expected,

945
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:00,638
young child of Emiya.

946
01:36:02,059 --> 01:36:03,048
Zouken.

947
01:36:04,633 --> 01:36:06,540
I've got one thing to say to you.

948
01:36:07,792 --> 01:36:09,912
Release Sakura right this minute.

949
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:12,983
Release her, you say?

950
01:36:13,506 --> 01:36:15,449
I guess that's one way to put it.

951
01:36:18,617 --> 01:36:20,274
Listen to me, boy.

952
01:36:21,141 --> 01:36:24,194
I called you here because I have a favor to ask.

953
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:28,801
I'd like you to exterminate that shadow for me.

954
01:36:31,418 --> 01:36:32,545
What do you mean?

955
01:36:32,633 --> 01:36:34,300
Isn't that thing on your side?

956
01:36:34,919 --> 01:36:36,254
Don't be silly.

957
01:36:37,091 --> 01:36:40,205
You honestly think I have the
means to communicate with it?

958
01:36:41,142 --> 01:36:44,842
If last night's any indication, I can't even calm it down.

959
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:49,387
Oh, right. Of course.

960
01:36:49,412 --> 01:36:54,142
I suppose it would be prudent for me
to tell you what exactly the shadow is.

961
01:36:54,951 --> 01:36:56,419
To put it bluntly,

962
01:36:56,483 --> 01:36:59,673
that thing is the contents of the Holy Grail.

963
01:37:01,586 --> 01:37:05,117
The will of the gate we call the Grail is overflowing,

964
01:37:05,308 --> 01:37:07,529
and that will is the shadow.

965
01:37:08,783 --> 01:37:10,134
I don't get it.

966
01:37:10,903 --> 01:37:11,767
Gate?

967
01:37:12,947 --> 01:37:15,306
I asked for you to kill the shadow,

968
01:37:15,681 --> 01:37:17,940
but that task is not an easy one.

969
01:37:19,316 --> 01:37:23,922
However, killing the gate
shouldn't be much trouble for you.

970
01:37:26,252 --> 01:37:29,593
It would sense my presence or that of the Tohsaka girl.

971
01:37:30,131 --> 01:37:33,363
Servants would be wasted. Nothing more than food.

972
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:35,581
No. Stop it!

973
01:37:36,212 --> 01:37:38,957
Ten years ago I found a fragment of the Grail.

974
01:37:39,608 --> 01:37:43,364
I planted it and I've been
nurturing its growth ever since,

975
01:37:43,455 --> 01:37:46,520
but the only one who can kill
the Holy Grail of the Matou...

976
01:37:46,545 --> 01:37:47,444
That's enough!

977
01:37:50,070 --> 01:37:52,199
Surely you've noticed, haven't you?

978
01:37:53,278 --> 01:37:56,103
The resemblance between Sakura and the shadow?

979
01:38:02,527 --> 01:38:05,921
She's merely a doll that does nothing but exist,

980
01:38:06,447 --> 01:38:09,095
to die at the hands of the man it loves.

981
01:38:09,599 --> 01:38:11,450
It'll be happiest this way.

982
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:15,389
Time has run out.

983
01:38:16,083 --> 01:38:18,988
Once Sakura loses what's left of herself,

984
01:38:19,137 --> 01:38:23,397
the Holy Grail that's lain dormant
in her subconscious will emerge.

985
01:38:24,454 --> 01:38:28,533
The catastrophe of ten years ago will then repeat itself.

986
01:38:31,289 --> 01:38:33,969
Or if you truly wish to save her,

987
01:38:34,118 --> 01:38:38,034
you need to endure until this
war has reached its expiration.

988
01:38:38,741 --> 01:38:43,336
If previous examples are any
indication, that's about four more days.

989
01:38:44,112 --> 01:38:45,286
What do you think?

990
01:38:45,485 --> 01:38:48,032
Can Sakura last that much longer?

991
01:38:48,834 --> 01:38:49,706
She can!

992
01:38:49,953 --> 01:38:51,884
She's stronger than you think she is!

993
01:38:52,659 --> 01:38:56,263
Perhaps, but what about
everyone else who lives in this city?

994
01:38:56,841 --> 01:39:01,393
Last night's little feast may have been enough
to keep it all filled up for the time being,

995
01:39:01,958 --> 01:39:05,033
but come tomorrow, it will be hungry again.

996
01:39:06,857 --> 01:39:12,762
How many days will it take before every
last human being in this city has been devoured?

997
01:39:15,388 --> 01:39:16,936
Do you understand?

998
01:39:17,218 --> 01:39:19,634
Vanquish evil to save the rest.

999
01:39:20,936 --> 01:39:24,108
If you wish to carry on Kiritsugu's legacy,

1000
01:39:25,634 --> 01:39:31,161
then only Sakura Matou is your true enemy.

1001
01:39:54,602 --> 01:39:55,524
Sakura.

1002
01:39:55,886 --> 01:39:57,021
Are you awake yet?

1003
01:40:00,950 --> 01:40:01,736
Yeah.

1004
01:40:02,839 --> 01:40:05,918
Good morning, Shirou. How are you?

1005
01:41:15,097 --> 01:41:16,272
Hey, Sakura.

1006
01:41:16,860 --> 01:41:18,570
When this thing is all over,

1007
01:41:18,867 --> 01:41:21,140
is there anything you wanna do?

1008
01:41:24,042 --> 01:41:26,834
I don't know, Shirou. Not that I can think of.

1009
01:41:27,312 --> 01:41:29,539
I mean, as long as I can be with you,

1010
01:41:29,564 --> 01:41:31,616
it doesn't matter what we do.

1011
01:41:33,174 --> 01:41:34,255
In that case,

1012
01:41:34,407 --> 01:41:36,509
how about we go on a trip somewhere together?

1013
01:41:37,643 --> 01:41:39,217
Where would you wanna go?

1014
01:41:42,548 --> 01:41:48,365
I think I'd like to go look at cherry blossoms, maybe.

1015
01:41:51,262 --> 01:41:52,135
All right.

1016
01:41:53,873 --> 01:41:55,233
That's a promise.

1017
01:42:11,190 --> 01:42:13,168
I'm trying to have a happy dream

1018
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:14,926
while my heart is frozen.

1019
01:42:17,301 --> 01:42:19,483
Someday winter will pass

1020
01:42:19,944 --> 01:42:21,499
and spring will come again.

1021
01:42:23,141 --> 01:42:24,304
And when it does...

1022
01:42:25,956 --> 01:42:27,951
We'll see the cherry blossoms.

1023
01:42:47,379 --> 01:42:50,466
Yeah, when spring comes.

1024
01:42:53,569 --> 01:42:54,758
Hi, Shirou.

1025
01:42:58,477 --> 01:43:00,754
I'm Sakura Matou.

1026
01:43:00,779 --> 01:43:01,571
This is for you.

1027
01:43:01,596 --> 01:43:02,794
This is the second time...

1028
01:43:03,128 --> 01:43:06,096
Someone dear to me gave me something special.

1029
01:43:06,254 --> 01:43:07,139
Shirou.

1030
01:43:08,072 --> 01:43:10,834
I wish this moment would last.

1031
01:43:10,859 --> 01:43:13,603
Shirou. Shirou. Shirou. Shirou.

1032
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:15,983
Shirou...

1033
01:44:05,881 --> 01:44:07,809
Will you betray yourself?

1034
01:44:12,485 --> 01:44:13,239
Yeah.

1035
01:44:14,436 --> 01:44:15,707
Yeah, I will.

1036
01:44:47,906 --> 01:44:50,283
Thank you for everything you've done, Shirou.

1037
01:44:50,977 --> 01:44:53,342
You've given me more than words can say.

1038
01:44:55,033 --> 01:44:57,017
And thank you, big sister.

1039
01:44:58,003 --> 01:45:01,520
Being able to call you that made me very happy.

1040
01:45:02,727 --> 01:45:05,966
Miss Fujimura, I wanna thank you, too.

1041
01:45:09,601 --> 01:45:11,680
But I can't keep my promise to you.

1042
01:45:12,148 --> 01:45:13,181
I'm sorry.

1043
01:45:19,433 --> 01:45:24,115
Rider, thank you for not killing Shirou.

1044
01:45:28,822 --> 01:45:29,818
Sakura.

1045
01:45:35,198 --> 01:45:36,745
My last command spell.

1046
01:45:39,125 --> 01:45:41,164
Please, Rider. For me.

1047
01:45:48,829 --> 01:45:51,511
I will stop Grandfather. I have to.

1048
01:45:52,814 --> 01:45:54,346
I know it's too late

1049
01:45:54,812 --> 01:45:56,716
but I can't cause any more trouble

1050
01:45:57,095 --> 01:45:58,393
than I already have.

1051
01:46:02,409 --> 01:46:04,107
Good morning. How are you...

1052
01:46:29,933 --> 01:46:32,203
Well. Hello, traitor.

1053
01:46:33,401 --> 01:46:36,054
You took your sweet time coming home, huh?

1054
01:46:42,068 --> 01:46:46,527
U... um, Shinji, I, uh...

1055
01:46:47,554 --> 01:46:49,514
Here. Hold onto this for me.

1056
01:46:53,797 --> 01:46:55,347
Nothing dangerous.

1057
01:47:05,852 --> 01:47:07,074
Beautiful.

1058
01:47:13,471 --> 01:47:15,261
You amaze me, Sakura.

1059
01:47:19,864 --> 01:47:24,057
Someday you might even surpass Tohsaka.

1060
01:47:28,502 --> 01:47:31,027
What are you...

1061
01:47:40,788 --> 01:47:42,723
Don't be so full of yourself.

1062
01:47:44,097 --> 01:47:46,446
After all, you're just my puppet.

1063
01:47:50,879 --> 01:47:53,081
I must have made another mistake.

1064
01:47:54,707 --> 01:47:56,921
That's why he does these things to me.

1065
01:47:59,009 --> 01:48:00,263
But it's okay.

1066
01:48:01,088 --> 01:48:04,477
Just put up with it for a while. Same as always.

1067
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,659
It's okay. It's okay.

1068
01:48:08,962 --> 01:48:10,731
It's okay, it's okay.

1069
01:48:11,310 --> 01:48:12,275
Sakura.

1070
01:48:13,882 --> 01:48:14,712
Stop!

1071
01:48:18,747 --> 01:48:20,222
Never again, Shinji.

1072
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:21,547
Leave me alone.

1073
01:48:21,634 --> 01:48:23,163
My heart is Shirou's!

1074
01:48:24,698 --> 01:48:25,976
What the hell?

1075
01:48:26,866 --> 01:48:30,158
I see he's got you tamed even better than I thought!

1076
01:48:31,009 --> 01:48:31,793
No!

1077
01:48:32,715 --> 01:48:35,507
Hey, what's the matter? Don't be shy.

1078
01:48:35,532 --> 01:48:37,731
Why does it always end like this?

1079
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:39,206
Come on!

1080
01:48:39,231 --> 01:48:41,446
That question's always plagued me.

1081
01:48:42,127 --> 01:48:44,642
I've harbored this anger so long.

1082
01:48:46,675 --> 01:48:51,889
I don't understand why the entire world hates me.

1083
01:48:52,486 --> 01:48:54,402
It hates me so much.

1084
01:48:57,438 --> 01:48:58,343
Yeah.

1085
01:48:59,821 --> 01:49:02,182
I have to tell Emiya about this.

1086
01:49:02,531 --> 01:49:07,000
About how you begged... pleaded for me
to have my way with you over and over.

1087
01:49:08,571 --> 01:49:10,372
I'll tell him about everything!

1088
01:49:10,413 --> 01:49:12,984
About every single time we fucked!

1089
01:49:17,524 --> 01:49:21,120
I wish this person would disappear.

1090
01:49:43,879 --> 01:49:46,530
Hey, Shinji?

1091
01:50:45,727 --> 01:50:47,643
Sakura!

1092
01:55:51,610 --> 01:55:53,237
I told you, remember?

1093
01:55:53,848 --> 01:55:56,904
That I'd become a hero of justice for you alone.

1094
01:55:59,101 --> 01:56:03,203
So get ready, 'cause I'm coming for you.
