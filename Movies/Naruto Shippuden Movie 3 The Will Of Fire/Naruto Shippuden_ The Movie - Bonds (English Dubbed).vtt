-Here.

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:02.076 position:7% line:83% align:start
This is where the trail of the
ninja with kekkei genkai ends.

00:01:23.063 --> 00:01:23.498 position:41% line:83% align:start
What?

00:01:48.457 --> 00:01:51.127 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Sai.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.194 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Stop, Naruto.

00:01:52.228 --> 00:01:54.263 position:7% line:83% align:start
We have a mission to complete.

00:01:54.297 --> 00:01:55.197 position:44% line:83% align:start
-No.

00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:56.499 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm not going to
leave Sai behind.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.939 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Naruto!

-How is he?

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:17.984 position:35% line:83% align:start
Is he OK?

00:03:26.493 --> 00:03:28.094 position:13% line:83% align:start
What was that for, Sakura?

00:03:32.732 --> 00:03:35.402 position:5% line:83% align:start
-For rushing in without thinking
and getting yourself hurt.

00:03:35.435 --> 00:03:37.303 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you're going to
run off, at least

00:03:37.337 --> 00:03:39.140 position:19% line:83% align:start
come up with some kind
of a plan beforehand.

00:03:39.172 --> 00:03:42.308 position:19% line:83% align:start
You careless, witless,
know-nothing idiot!

00:03:42.342 --> 00:03:44.111 position:21% line:83% align:start
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
He's a lot like you.

00:03:44.145 --> 00:03:46.346 position:16% line:83% align:start
Don't you think, Obito?

00:04:12.808 --> 00:04:13.274 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.

00:04:16.712 --> 00:04:18.580 position:21% line:83% align:start
KAKASHI: We pursued
all four of the ninja

00:04:18.613 --> 00:04:20.282 position:24% line:83% align:start
with kekkei genkai
that disappeared

00:04:20.315 --> 00:04:21.983 position:16% line:83% align:start
from the major villages.

00:04:22.018 --> 00:04:24.653 position:19% line:83% align:start
Their trails led here.

00:04:24.686 --> 00:04:28.091 position:10% line:83% align:start
But then they ended right at
Mount Shumisen in the Konrin

00:04:28.124 --> 00:04:30.425 position:19% line:83% align:start
Range on the border of
the Hidden Grass Village

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:33.428 position:10% line:83% align:start
and the Hidden Stone Village
in the Land of Earth.

00:04:33.462 --> 00:04:34.697 position:30% line:83% align:start
-You did well.

00:04:34.731 --> 00:04:36.799 position:10% line:83% align:start
-And what should we do now?

00:04:36.833 --> 00:04:39.669 position:7% line:83% align:start
-We'll handle it from here on
out, so don't worry about it.

00:04:39.702 --> 00:04:41.104 position:21% line:83% align:start
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
If someone's

00:04:41.137 --> 00:04:43.573 position:24% line:83% align:start
going after ninja
with kekkei genkai,

00:04:43.606 --> 00:04:46.275 position:7% line:83% align:start
the next likely target is me.

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:47.844 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Is something wrong?

00:04:47.877 --> 00:04:48.745 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Nothing.

00:04:48.778 --> 00:04:51.314 position:16% line:83% align:start
-So how are the others?

00:04:51.347 --> 00:04:54.785 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Well, we had to force them
to go to the hospital, but--

00:04:54.818 --> 00:04:58.387 position:13% line:83% align:start
--[sigh] Those two aren't
really the type to stay in bed,

00:04:58.421 --> 00:04:58.889 position:35% line:83% align:start
are they?

00:05:17.574 --> 00:05:18.609 position:35% line:83% align:start
-So good.

00:05:18.642 --> 00:05:21.112 position:24% line:83% align:start
-You shouldn't eat
so much, Choji.

00:05:21.146 --> 00:05:23.948 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Asuma Sensei would never
nag me like that, you know.

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:30.388 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Yeah, but you're not
the guest of honor today.

00:05:30.421 --> 00:05:33.725 position:19% line:83% align:start
Besides, if you eat so
much, you'll get fa--

00:05:33.758 --> 00:05:35.227 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Shikamaru!

00:05:35.261 --> 00:05:35.927 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ah.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.163 position:19% line:83% align:start
What I meant was-- OK.

00:05:37.196 --> 00:05:37.862 position:41% line:83% align:start
Fine.

00:05:37.896 --> 00:05:38.763 position:24% line:83% align:start
This one's on me.

00:05:38.797 --> 00:05:39.697 position:19% line:83% align:start
ROCK LEE: Sounds good.

00:05:43.068 --> 00:05:44.937 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Hey.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:45.805 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Wait.

00:05:45.838 --> 00:05:47.873 position:27% line:83% align:start
What are all you
guys doing here?

00:05:47.907 --> 00:05:50.142 position:19% line:83% align:start
-We heard there was a
celebration for Naruto

00:05:50.176 --> 00:05:52.144 position:21% line:83% align:start
and Sai's recovery.

00:05:52.178 --> 00:05:53.546 position:33% line:83% align:start
Same for me.

00:05:53.579 --> 00:05:54.647 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Hinata told us.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.015 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Yes, me too.

00:05:56.048 --> 00:05:59.286 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Naruto said I should spread
the word to everybody, so I did.

to keep this small and private.

00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:04.690 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, there's no way
I'm paying for all this.

00:06:04.723 --> 00:06:06.759 position:19% line:83% align:start
-So where are the two
guests of honor anyway?

00:06:09.628 --> 00:06:11.998 position:10% line:83% align:start
NARUTO: Thanks for waiting.

00:06:12.032 --> 00:06:13.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey, the gang's all here.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.135 position:7% line:83% align:start
-We shouldn't do this, Naruto.

00:06:15.168 --> 00:06:17.070 position:5% line:83% align:start
We haven't been discharged yet.

00:06:17.103 --> 00:06:17.571 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Eh.

00:06:17.604 --> 00:06:18.772 position:38% line:83% align:start
So what?

00:06:18.805 --> 00:06:21.309 position:16% line:83% align:start
-What were you thinking
inviting all these people?

00:06:21.341 --> 00:06:22.175 position:30% line:83% align:start
-It's a party.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:23.211 position:19% line:83% align:start
The more the merrier.

00:06:23.244 --> 00:06:24.678 position:19% line:83% align:start
Isn't that right, Sai?

00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:26.147 position:38% line:83% align:start
-My IV.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.980 position:33% line:83% align:start
-All right.

00:06:27.014 --> 00:06:28.216 position:7% line:83% align:start
Let's get this party started.

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:30.852 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's time to celebrate
our recovery.

00:06:30.885 --> 00:06:31.618 position:33% line:83% align:start
Now, eat up.

00:06:31.651 --> 00:06:32.987 position:21% line:83% align:start
Shikamaru's buying.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.588 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Hey, I never said I'd--

00:06:34.621 --> 00:06:36.523 position:21% line:83% align:start
ALL: Thanks for the
food, Shikamaru.

00:06:36.556 --> 00:06:37.225 position:44% line:83% align:start
-OK.

00:06:37.258 --> 00:06:38.693 position:16% line:83% align:start
Time for us to eat too.

00:06:38.726 --> 00:06:39.660 position:33% line:83% align:start
-You idiots!

00:06:50.905 --> 00:06:51.372 position:44% line:83% align:start
-OK.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.345 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Sakura, come on.

00:06:56.377 --> 00:06:57.712 position:16% line:83% align:start
Take it easy, will you?

00:06:57.745 --> 00:06:59.413 position:13% line:83% align:start
We are injured, you know.

00:06:59.447 --> 00:07:03.252 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Not that injured, not if you
can go out to eat barbecue.

00:07:03.285 --> 00:07:06.021 position:19% line:83% align:start
That was just in place
of real punishment.

00:07:06.054 --> 00:07:08.924 position:13% line:83% align:start
If it hurt, get back into
bed where you belong.

00:07:08.957 --> 00:07:10.659 position:5% line:83% align:start
-(GRUMBLING) Get back into bed.

00:07:10.692 --> 00:07:12.661 position:21% line:83% align:start
SAKURA (VOICEOVER):
That's Naruto for you.

00:07:12.694 --> 00:07:13.962 position:10% line:83% align:start
He always heals so quickly.

00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:21.838 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Man, why is she so angry?

00:07:21.871 --> 00:07:24.007 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Hey, you're in good spirits.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.174 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Hi, Kakashi Sensei.

00:07:25.208 --> 00:07:27.010 position:13% line:83% align:start
Did you come to visit us?

00:07:27.043 --> 00:07:28.378 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Sort of.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:31.915 position:5% line:83% align:start
I figured you'd be bored cooped
up in the hospital, so here.

00:07:31.948 --> 00:07:33.783 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Thanks, Kakashi Sensei.

00:07:33.816 --> 00:07:34.284 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hm?

00:07:40.124 --> 00:07:43.426 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Girls hide their true feelings
of worry and other emotions

00:07:43.459 --> 00:07:46.562 position:16% line:83% align:start
by purposefully getting
angry and being violent.

00:07:46.596 --> 00:07:47.630 position:44% line:83% align:start
Huh?

00:07:47.664 --> 00:07:49.532 position:13% line:83% align:start
This will be very helpful.

00:07:49.565 --> 00:07:51.235 position:24% line:83% align:start
-So what do I get?

00:07:51.268 --> 00:07:54.238 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Well, since you don't
really like to read books,

00:07:54.271 --> 00:07:57.074 position:24% line:83% align:start
I thought that I'd
bring this instead.

00:07:57.107 --> 00:07:58.575 position:10% line:83% align:start
-What's that supposed to be?

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.319 position:13% line:83% align:start
-What are those bells for?

00:08:11.122 --> 00:08:13.624 position:19% line:83% align:start
-You just have to take
these bells from me.

00:08:13.657 --> 00:08:16.094 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you can't get them by
noon, you go without lunch.

00:08:19.463 --> 00:08:20.365 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Let me down.

00:08:24.202 --> 00:08:25.103 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Fire Style.

00:08:25.136 --> 00:08:26.972 position:27% line:83% align:start
Fireball Jutsu.

00:08:27.005 --> 00:08:29.408 position:13% line:83% align:start
NARUTO: Sakura and Sasuke
disobeyed Kakashi Sensei's

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:32.744 position:24% line:83% align:start
orders by sharing
their lunches with me.

00:08:32.777 --> 00:08:34.646 position:24% line:83% align:start
But of course, he
found out, and I

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:37.049 position:19% line:83% align:start
thought he was totally
going to fail us.

00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:38.150 position:35% line:83% align:start
-You pass.

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:42.154 position:16% line:83% align:start
NARUTO: But in the end,
he passed us after all.

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:44.557 position:21% line:83% align:start
-In the ninja world,
those who break the rules

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.360 position:24% line:83% align:start
are considered to
be nothing but scum.

00:08:47.394 --> 00:08:50.663 position:16% line:83% align:start
However, those ninja who
abandon their friends

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:53.499 position:13% line:83% align:start
are even worse than scum.

00:08:53.532 --> 00:08:56.269 position:16% line:83% align:start
-I'll never forget what
he taught us that day.

00:08:56.303 --> 00:08:58.205 position:30% line:83% align:start
I never will.

00:08:58.238 --> 00:08:59.638 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Oh.

00:08:59.672 --> 00:09:00.606 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Wait.

00:09:00.639 --> 00:09:02.242 position:27% line:83% align:start
Weren't you also
taught that lesson?

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:04.478 position:30% line:83% align:start
-For the ANBU,
abandoning your friends

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.447 position:19% line:83% align:start
is fine as long as you
complete the mission.

00:09:07.481 --> 00:09:11.785 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Man, you really had a
dark childhood, didn't you?

00:09:11.818 --> 00:09:14.154 position:13% line:83% align:start
But why give these to me?

00:09:14.187 --> 00:09:16.491 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Well, as you can see, they've
gotten pretty banged up,

00:09:16.523 --> 00:09:17.924 position:24% line:83% align:start
so I brought them
here, because I'd

00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.960 position:10% line:83% align:start
like you to fix them for me.

00:09:19.993 --> 00:09:21.528 position:41% line:83% align:start
-What?

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:24.399 position:19% line:83% align:start
-I'm counting on you,
Naruto, but right now I'm

00:09:24.432 --> 00:09:25.366 position:21% line:83% align:start
in a bit of a hurry.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.567 position:7% line:83% align:start
So good luck with those bells.

00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:28.535 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Hey, wait.

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.705 position:16% line:83% align:start
Kakashi Sensei, come on.

00:09:33.608 --> 00:09:35.676 position:27% line:83% align:start
-See you later.

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.845 position:10% line:83% align:start
-How the heck am I supposed
to fix these things.

00:09:37.879 --> 00:09:41.350 position:7% line:83% align:start
If you want them fixed so bad,
you should just do it yourself.

00:09:41.383 --> 00:09:41.849 position:41% line:83% align:start
Hello!

00:09:49.525 --> 00:09:51.960 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Are they ANBU from the Leaf?

00:09:51.994 --> 00:09:53.362 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Don't worry.

00:09:53.395 --> 00:09:55.798 position:16% line:83% align:start
There are no ninja that
can stand against us.

00:10:12.748 --> 00:10:13.916 position:33% line:83% align:start
-That's it.

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.219 position:13% line:83% align:start
You possess only ordinary
Earth style techniques?

00:10:30.266 --> 00:10:32.902 position:24% line:83% align:start
The time has come.

00:10:32.936 --> 00:10:34.804 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Lady Tsunade!

00:10:34.838 --> 00:10:37.074 position:19% line:83% align:start
-What is it, Shizune?

00:10:37.108 --> 00:10:39.510 position:19% line:83% align:start
The three ANBU that we
sent to Mount Shimusen,

00:10:39.543 --> 00:10:41.145 position:27% line:83% align:start
have you finally
heard back from them?

00:10:41.178 --> 00:10:41.811 position:44% line:83% align:start
-No.

00:10:41.846 --> 00:10:43.147 position:21% line:83% align:start
But look at the sky.

00:10:54.058 --> 00:10:57.027 position:16% line:83% align:start
-I am a ninja originally
from the Hidden Leaf.

00:10:57.061 --> 00:10:58.996 position:24% line:83% align:start
My name is Hiruko.

00:10:59.029 --> 00:11:00.764 position:41% line:83% align:start
-What?

00:11:00.798 --> 00:11:02.534 position:30% line:83% align:start
This can't be.

00:11:02.567 --> 00:11:04.136 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hiruko couldn't
still be a child.

00:11:09.407 --> 00:11:12.644 position:24% line:83% align:start
-What is going on?

00:11:12.677 --> 00:11:16.681 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Thanks to my Chimera Jutsu,
four of the kekkei genkai

00:11:16.715 --> 00:11:19.519 position:10% line:83% align:start
from each of the great ninja
villages are already mine.

00:11:19.552 --> 00:11:23.289 position:7% line:83% align:start
Soon, I will obtain the fifth
and final kekkei genkai.

00:11:23.322 --> 00:11:26.925 position:16% line:83% align:start
And once I possess it, I
will become invincible,

00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.861 position:16% line:83% align:start
a perfect immortal ninja
that none in all the world

00:11:29.895 --> 00:11:31.796 position:24% line:83% align:start
can stand against.

00:11:31.831 --> 00:11:35.501 position:7% line:83% align:start
With that power, I will start
the Fourth Great Ninja War.

00:11:35.535 --> 00:11:37.970 position:5% line:83% align:start
And I will rule over everything.

00:11:45.845 --> 00:11:47.314 position:27% line:83% align:start
TSUNADE: For the
foreseeable future,

00:11:47.347 --> 00:11:50.350 position:21% line:83% align:start
our village has been
placed under martial law.

00:11:50.384 --> 00:11:52.119 position:21% line:83% align:start
As you're all aware
by now, a ninja

00:11:52.152 --> 00:11:55.755 position:24% line:83% align:start
called Hiruko has
declared war on our world.

00:11:55.788 --> 00:11:58.659 position:10% line:83% align:start
Our village now finds itself
in a more dangerous position

00:11:58.724 --> 00:11:59.660 position:35% line:83% align:start
than ever.

00:11:59.692 --> 00:12:01.228 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's possible that
other villages

00:12:01.261 --> 00:12:03.230 position:27% line:83% align:start
could attack us
at any moment too.

00:12:03.263 --> 00:12:03.964 position:33% line:83% align:start
Stay sharp.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.906 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Naruto, looks like
something big is happening.

00:12:21.916 --> 00:12:23.585 position:7% line:83% align:start
TSUNADE: Where's the Kazekage?

00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:26.287 position:13% line:83% align:start
Why isn't Gaara here yet?

00:12:26.321 --> 00:12:27.789 position:21% line:83% align:start
-I'm not quite sure.

00:12:27.822 --> 00:12:30.291 position:10% line:83% align:start
The delegation already left
the Hidden Sand Village,

00:12:30.325 --> 00:12:32.260 position:13% line:83% align:start
so they should be nearby.

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:34.430 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm guessing they'll
arrive within half an hour.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:41.970 position:30% line:83% align:start
Lady Tsunade?

00:12:44.974 --> 00:12:46.408 position:21% line:83% align:start
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER):
This situation

00:12:46.442 --> 00:12:48.811 position:19% line:83% align:start
is already beyond the
power of the Leaf alone.

00:12:48.844 --> 00:12:51.914 position:13% line:83% align:start
We need your cooperation,
or all is lost.

00:12:55.719 --> 00:12:58.421 position:16% line:83% align:start
-The five great nations
that rule the continent each

00:12:58.455 --> 00:13:00.089 position:7% line:83% align:start
have their own hidden village.

00:13:00.122 --> 00:13:01.824 position:21% line:83% align:start
They're all prepared
for an invasion

00:13:01.857 --> 00:13:04.126 position:5% line:83% align:start
from any of the other countries.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.896 position:5% line:83% align:start
And this land, the Land of Fire,
is the most powerful nation,

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.034 position:19% line:83% align:start
in part because of the
protection from the Leaf.

00:13:11.067 --> 00:13:14.838 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yet suspicion remains that
there may be a coup d'etat.

00:13:14.871 --> 00:13:17.841 position:16% line:83% align:start
At the same time, we've
received further reports

00:13:17.874 --> 00:13:20.143 position:19% line:83% align:start
that the other nations
are preparing for war,

00:13:20.176 --> 00:13:23.813 position:7% line:83% align:start
and their villages are sending
ninja to our border to invade.

00:13:23.847 --> 00:13:26.417 position:21% line:83% align:start
This puts an extreme
strain on the trust

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.753 position:21% line:83% align:start
between our country
and the Leaf.

00:13:28.785 --> 00:13:30.421 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Please, just wait.

00:13:30.454 --> 00:13:31.054 position:41% line:83% align:start
Look.

00:13:31.088 --> 00:13:32.456 position:24% line:83% align:start
I cannot deny it.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:35.859 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hiruko did research the Chimera
Jutsu in our village years ago,

00:13:35.893 --> 00:13:37.628 position:16% line:83% align:start
but without permission.

00:13:37.662 --> 00:13:40.798 position:16% line:83% align:start
And besides, he has long
since left the village.

00:13:40.831 --> 00:13:43.134 position:33% line:83% align:start
-No excuses.

00:13:43.167 --> 00:13:45.069 position:27% line:83% align:start
Bring the guilty
party to justice.

00:13:45.102 --> 00:13:47.405 position:16% line:83% align:start
Solve this problem now.

00:13:47.439 --> 00:13:50.776 position:10% line:83% align:start
-And if you can't do so, the
Village Hidden in the Leaves

00:13:50.808 --> 00:13:52.311 position:21% line:83% align:start
will be eradicated.

00:13:52.344 --> 00:13:54.979 position:21% line:83% align:start
Prove your innocence
to us immediately.

00:13:55.012 --> 00:13:57.649 position:16% line:83% align:start
That is the only way we
will allow the Hidden Leaf's

00:13:57.683 --> 00:13:58.717 position:21% line:83% align:start
continued existence.

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.121 position:10% line:83% align:start
TSUNADE (VOICEOVER): Gaara.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.128 position:30% line:83% align:start
-What is that?

00:15:03.785 --> 00:15:04.753 position:16% line:83% align:start
MESSENGER: Lady Tsunade.

00:15:04.786 --> 00:15:05.919 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hm?

00:15:05.953 --> 00:15:06.987 position:30% line:83% align:start
-I have news.

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.857 position:21% line:83% align:start
The delegation from
the Hidden Sand

00:15:08.889 --> 00:15:10.592 position:5% line:83% align:start
has been caught in a rock slide.

00:15:10.625 --> 00:15:12.193 position:27% line:83% align:start
-What happened?

00:15:12.227 --> 00:15:13.395 position:7% line:83% align:start
-This was found at the scene.

00:15:17.665 --> 00:15:18.199 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Lady Tsunade.

00:15:21.936 --> 00:15:26.341 position:13% line:83% align:start
-A storm is coming, what I
feared more than anything else.

00:15:26.374 --> 00:15:31.246 position:13% line:83% align:start
This could be the start of
the Fourth Great Ninja War.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.315 position:24% line:83% align:start
HIROKU: My Chimera
Jutsu alone won't

00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:36.452 position:21% line:83% align:start
be enough to engulf
the kekkei genkai.

00:15:36.485 --> 00:15:39.588 position:5% line:83% align:start
I need a special jutsu formula.

00:15:39.622 --> 00:15:43.092 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've already performed the
jutsu formula for the first four

00:15:43.125 --> 00:15:44.493 position:30% line:83% align:start
kekkei genkai.

00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:48.431 position:5% line:83% align:start
However, in order to obtain the
fight and final kekkei genkai

00:15:48.464 --> 00:15:51.535 position:19% line:83% align:start
wielder, I must first
complete the requirements

00:15:51.568 --> 00:15:55.705 position:10% line:83% align:start
for Heaven, Earth, and Man.

00:15:55.739 --> 00:15:58.941 position:24% line:83% align:start
The first, Heaven,
is a solar eclipse.

00:15:58.974 --> 00:16:01.912 position:24% line:83% align:start
The second, Earth,
is Mount Shumisen.

00:16:01.944 --> 00:16:09.085 position:13% line:83% align:start
For the third, Man-- once
I absorb that person's

00:16:09.119 --> 00:16:13.156 position:5% line:83% align:start
kekkei genkai technique, I will
create a harmony of the five

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.593 position:10% line:83% align:start
kekkei genkai within myself.

00:16:15.626 --> 00:16:19.029 position:19% line:83% align:start
At last, I will become
immortal and complete

00:16:19.062 --> 00:16:21.365 position:19% line:83% align:start
as the perfect ninja.

00:16:21.399 --> 00:16:24.769 position:13% line:83% align:start
And that fifth shinobi who
possesses a suitable kekkei

00:16:24.802 --> 00:16:29.674 position:24% line:83% align:start
genkai, yes, I've
left you for last.

00:16:29.707 --> 00:16:33.678 position:5% line:83% align:start
Since you're such an old friend,
that only seems fair after all.

00:16:49.361 --> 00:16:52.397 position:24% line:83% align:start
-It's been a long
time, Kakashi Hatake.

00:16:57.837 --> 00:16:59.271 position:41% line:83% align:start
-You.

00:16:59.304 --> 00:17:00.773 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're Hiruko.

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:31.404 position:33% line:83% align:start
-What is it?

00:17:31.437 --> 00:17:34.073 position:16% line:83% align:start
-The seal has appeared.

00:17:34.107 --> 00:17:38.077 position:10% line:83% align:start
It seems that 10 years ago,
Hiroku made his choice.

00:17:38.111 --> 00:17:40.314 position:24% line:83% align:start
He already decided
on my Sharingan

00:17:40.347 --> 00:17:42.416 position:10% line:83% align:start
as the fifth kekkei genkai.

00:17:42.449 --> 00:17:47.755 position:7% line:83% align:start
At some point, he put a Puppet
Master Jutsu formula on me.

00:17:47.788 --> 00:17:49.557 position:35% line:83% align:start
-But why?

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:51.760 position:19% line:83% align:start
Is this all some kind
of plan to get revenge

00:17:51.793 --> 00:17:53.427 position:10% line:83% align:start
on the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.831 position:21% line:83% align:start
If so, then I should
take the blame as well.

00:17:56.865 --> 00:17:59.333 position:27% line:83% align:start
I will not hand
you over to Hiruko.

00:17:59.367 --> 00:18:00.402 position:35% line:83% align:start
-You must.

00:18:00.435 --> 00:18:02.069 position:24% line:83% align:start
Please let me go.

00:18:02.102 --> 00:18:02.771 position:44% line:83% align:start
-No.

00:18:02.804 --> 00:18:03.705 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just save your breath.

00:18:03.738 --> 00:18:05.974 position:7% line:83% align:start
I already saw ANBU's reports.

00:18:06.007 --> 00:18:08.944 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's perfected the jutsu
formula for changing ninja arts

00:18:08.978 --> 00:18:12.280 position:5% line:83% align:start
into chakra and absorbing them.

00:18:12.314 --> 00:18:14.984 position:10% line:83% align:start
So no matter how skilled the
ninja who goes after him,

00:18:15.017 --> 00:18:16.618 position:13% line:83% align:start
they won't even get close.

00:18:16.651 --> 00:18:19.120 position:10% line:83% align:start
He's essentially invincible.

00:18:19.154 --> 00:18:20.556 position:30% line:83% align:start
-If that's the
case, then why is he

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:24.560 position:19% line:83% align:start
calling out only ninja
with kekkei genkai.

00:18:24.594 --> 00:18:27.228 position:24% line:83% align:start
I suspect he needs
some special conditions

00:18:27.263 --> 00:18:30.032 position:21% line:83% align:start
before he can absorb
the kekkei genkai.

00:18:30.066 --> 00:18:32.702 position:10% line:83% align:start
Otherwise, why would he wait
until now to call for me?

00:18:35.371 --> 00:18:36.305 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yes.

00:18:36.339 --> 00:18:37.975 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've heard the jutsu
formula requires

00:18:38.008 --> 00:18:39.076 position:16% line:83% align:start
a special type of light.

00:18:43.579 --> 00:18:47.484 position:13% line:83% align:start
Two days from now, there's
going to be a solar eclipse.

00:18:47.517 --> 00:18:48.518 position:24% line:83% align:start
-That must be it.

00:18:48.552 --> 00:18:50.454 position:13% line:83% align:start
So there's not much time.

00:18:50.487 --> 00:18:54.591 position:16% line:83% align:start
Lady Tsunade, I want you
apply a jutsu formula to me.

00:18:54.625 --> 00:18:58.997 position:16% line:83% align:start
I believe it's the only
way to defeat Hiroku.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.598 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Kakashi, you know I can't.

00:19:01.632 --> 00:19:05.036 position:19% line:83% align:start
I cannot sacrifice you
to save the village.

00:19:05.069 --> 00:19:06.838 position:21% line:83% align:start
You know how unkind
history would

00:19:06.871 --> 00:19:08.873 position:7% line:83% align:start
be to a Hokage who'd do that?

00:19:08.906 --> 00:19:12.142 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Yes, but you'll do it
anyway, because that's

00:19:12.175 --> 00:19:13.978 position:5% line:83% align:start
your Will of Fire, Lady Tsunade.

00:19:29.727 --> 00:19:32.296 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Asuma, right now,
the village is

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:34.833 position:21% line:83% align:start
facing what could be
its worse crisis ever.

00:19:37.569 --> 00:19:43.242 position:7% line:83% align:start
-All those games of Shogi, and
not once, could I beat you.

00:19:43.275 --> 00:19:45.110 position:27% line:83% align:start
Remember when we
talked about the king?

00:19:48.114 --> 00:19:53.019 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now I'm going to tell
you who the king is.

00:19:53.053 --> 00:19:53.585 position:33% line:83% align:start
Lean closer.

00:20:02.762 --> 00:20:05.732 position:21% line:83% align:start
-But Asuma, so then
that's why you--

00:20:11.738 --> 00:20:14.541 position:5% line:83% align:start
-I'm counting on you, Shikamaru.

00:20:36.063 --> 00:20:39.201 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Now it's my turn, Asuma.

00:20:39.233 --> 00:20:41.602 position:24% line:83% align:start
The king you gave
your life to defend,

00:20:41.635 --> 00:20:44.505 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll keep it safe
no matter what.

00:20:47.308 --> 00:20:50.712 position:21% line:83% align:start
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
Obito, Rin, I

00:20:50.746 --> 00:20:53.782 position:5% line:83% align:start
wasn't able to protect you both.

00:20:53.815 --> 00:20:57.152 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I will protect the
Village Hidden in the Leaves

00:20:57.185 --> 00:20:58.019 position:24% line:83% align:start
whatever it takes.

00:21:11.666 --> 00:21:15.938 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Kakashi Sensei, are you
here to visit someone?

00:21:15.972 --> 00:21:16.606 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.

00:21:16.639 --> 00:21:17.807 position:21% line:83% align:start
Something like that.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:18.841 position:38% line:83% align:start
And you?

00:21:18.875 --> 00:21:20.409 position:19% line:83% align:start
You here to see Asuma?

00:21:20.443 --> 00:21:20.910 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.

00:21:27.583 --> 00:21:31.554 position:7% line:83% align:start
To follow through on the last
words that Asuma said to me.

00:21:31.587 --> 00:21:34.590 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'll put my life on the line
to protect the Hidden Leaf

00:21:34.624 --> 00:21:37.094 position:38% line:83% align:start
Village.

00:21:37.127 --> 00:21:37.861 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's all.

00:21:44.268 --> 00:21:48.005 position:7% line:83% align:start
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER): So that's
your Will of Fire, is it?

00:21:48.038 --> 00:21:50.507 position:27% line:83% align:start
You've become an
excellent shinobi.

00:21:50.541 --> 00:21:51.942 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?

00:21:51.975 --> 00:21:53.977 position:33% line:83% align:start
What is it?

00:21:54.012 --> 00:21:56.647 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Well, I was wondering
if you could give Naruto

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.950 position:24% line:83% align:start
a message for me.

00:21:58.983 --> 00:22:02.220 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Yeah, or you could just
tell him yourself, you know.

00:22:02.253 --> 00:22:04.789 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Actually, I can't do that.

00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:07.792 position:41% line:83% align:start
-What?

00:22:07.826 --> 00:22:10.195 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're going to get me mixed
up in some kind of trouble,

00:22:10.228 --> 00:22:12.997 position:33% line:83% align:start
aren't you?

00:22:13.031 --> 00:22:15.333 position:16% line:83% align:start
-You always have such a
cheery attitude, Shikamaru.

00:22:22.908 --> 00:22:24.709 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Are you sure that it's
a good idea for you

00:22:24.742 --> 00:22:26.011 position:7% line:83% align:start
to sneak out of the hospital?

00:22:26.045 --> 00:22:28.379 position:35% line:83% align:start
[slurping]

00:22:30.983 --> 00:22:32.450 position:21% line:83% align:start
-While I was in the
hospital, I heard

00:22:32.484 --> 00:22:34.753 position:5% line:83% align:start
things are pretty bad out there.

00:22:34.787 --> 00:22:36.956 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's no time to be resting.

00:22:36.989 --> 00:22:37.790 position:21% line:83% align:start
Thanks for the food.

00:22:42.995 --> 00:22:45.065 position:16% line:83% align:start
-You know this my first
time in the Land of Fire.

00:22:45.098 --> 00:22:46.032 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Kakashi Sensei?

00:22:57.409 --> 00:22:58.578 position:24% line:83% align:start
-It's past curfew.

00:22:58.612 --> 00:23:00.680 position:16% line:83% align:start
-We can't even allow you
to pass through, Kakashi.

00:23:24.038 --> 00:23:25.907 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Kakashi Sensei!

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:28.776 position:21% line:83% align:start
Kakashi, what's the
matter with you?

00:23:28.809 --> 00:23:30.111 position:24% line:83% align:start
Can't you hear me?

00:23:30.144 --> 00:23:31.179 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Stop, Naruto.

00:23:31.213 --> 00:23:32.281 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Get out of the way.

00:23:32.314 --> 00:23:33.348 position:35% line:83% align:start
Will you?

00:23:33.382 --> 00:23:36.118 position:24% line:83% align:start
Kakashi Sensei is
acting really weird.

00:23:36.151 --> 00:23:38.786 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Shadow Possession Jutsu.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.588 position:21% line:83% align:start
-What are you doing?

00:23:40.621 --> 00:23:44.059 position:24% line:83% align:start
-I have a message
from Kakashi for you.

00:23:44.092 --> 00:23:47.362 position:10% line:83% align:start
Even if I disappear from the
village, don't go following me.

00:23:47.396 --> 00:23:49.898 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's exactly what he told
me to tell you, Naruto.

00:23:49.932 --> 00:23:50.400 position:41% line:83% align:start
-What?

00:23:57.706 --> 00:23:58.907 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Spill it.

00:23:58.941 --> 00:23:59.976 position:24% line:83% align:start
What do you know?

00:24:00.009 --> 00:24:01.877 position:13% line:83% align:start
-I've told you all I can.

00:24:01.911 --> 00:24:04.113 position:19% line:83% align:start
But as a ninja of the
Leaf, you should know,

00:24:04.147 --> 00:24:06.481 position:13% line:83% align:start
our code is to follow the
orders of the village.

00:24:06.515 --> 00:24:09.719 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Why you.

00:24:09.752 --> 00:24:11.054 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'll stop him.

00:24:11.087 --> 00:24:13.890 position:19% line:83% align:start
-For the village, he'd
give his own life,

00:24:13.923 --> 00:24:16.259 position:19% line:83% align:start
because that's Kakashi
Sensei's Will of Fire.

00:24:21.531 --> 00:24:23.400 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Sensei.

00:24:23.434 --> 00:24:24.867 position:27% line:83% align:start
Kakashi Sensei.

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:35.379 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Kakashi Hatake has
left the village.

00:24:35.412 --> 00:24:37.915 position:16% line:83% align:start
From here on out, he no
longer has any connection

00:24:37.948 --> 00:24:39.616 position:19% line:83% align:start
with the Hidden Leaf.

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.586 position:16% line:83% align:start
No matter what happens,
he's no longer your concern,

00:24:42.619 --> 00:24:44.422 position:24% line:83% align:start
and that includes
chasing after him.

00:24:44.456 --> 00:24:45.889 position:33% line:83% align:start
I forbid it.

00:24:45.923 --> 00:24:46.890 position:38% line:83% align:start
Now go.

00:24:46.924 --> 00:24:49.027 position:24% line:83% align:start
Spread the word to
every single unit.

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:50.161 position:24% line:83% align:start
-But Lady Tsunade.

00:24:50.195 --> 00:24:50.661 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Dismissed.

00:24:56.201 --> 00:24:57.135 position:27% line:83% align:start
Stay, Shikamaru.

00:24:57.168 --> 00:24:58.770 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?

00:24:58.803 --> 00:25:01.773 position:24% line:83% align:start
-We need to talk.

00:25:01.806 --> 00:25:02.273 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Right.

00:25:06.711 --> 00:25:08.913 position:24% line:83% align:start
Just like Kakashi
Sensei thought he would,

00:25:08.947 --> 00:25:11.716 position:7% line:83% align:start
Naruto tried to go after him.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:14.453 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've locked him in
prison for now, but--

00:25:14.487 --> 00:25:15.321 position:21% line:83% align:start
TSUNADE: That idiot.

00:25:15.354 --> 00:25:16.188 position:33% line:83% align:start
What a mess.

00:25:21.659 --> 00:25:24.296 position:27% line:83% align:start
-This thing with
Kakashi, it's related

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:28.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
to that illusion we saw
the other day, isn't it?

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.237 position:13% line:83% align:start
When he left the village,
it was pretty clear to me

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.172 position:24% line:83% align:start
that somebody else
was controlling him,

00:25:33.205 --> 00:25:36.476 position:5% line:83% align:start
but he had prepared himself for
it and accepted it willingly.

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:39.446 position:10% line:83% align:start
Why would he do such a thing
unless there was no other way

00:25:39.479 --> 00:25:41.214 position:21% line:83% align:start
to defeat the enemy?

00:25:41.248 --> 00:25:43.283 position:19% line:83% align:start
Tell me if I'm wrong.

00:25:43.316 --> 00:25:45.786 position:27% line:83% align:start
-As usual, your
mind is very sharp.

00:25:45.819 --> 00:25:49.356 position:19% line:83% align:start
-And you approved this
plan, Lady Tsunade.

00:25:49.389 --> 00:25:50.590 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yes.

00:25:50.624 --> 00:25:53.794 position:16% line:83% align:start
I ordered him to die for
the sake of the village.

00:25:53.827 --> 00:25:55.562 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Let me out of here.

00:25:55.595 --> 00:25:57.130 position:27% line:83% align:start
Give me a break.

00:25:57.164 --> 00:25:58.899 position:16% line:83% align:start
Open this cell already.

00:25:58.932 --> 00:26:01.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have to catch up to
Kakashi Sensei and fast.

00:26:01.635 --> 00:26:04.539 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've got to bring him back here.

00:26:04.571 --> 00:26:05.506 position:33% line:83% align:start
Dammit all.

00:26:10.011 --> 00:26:12.547 position:7% line:83% align:start
Somebody come and let me out.

00:26:12.579 --> 00:26:14.782 position:21% line:83% align:start
Isn't anybody there?

00:26:14.816 --> 00:26:16.417 position:33% line:83% align:start
He needs me.

00:26:16.451 --> 00:26:18.252 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've got to help him.

00:26:18.286 --> 00:26:20.688 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why doesn't anybody
understand that?

00:26:20.721 --> 00:26:21.490 position:30% line:83% align:start
[bells jangle]

00:26:26.961 --> 00:26:29.964 position:27% line:83% align:start
Kakashi Sensei.

00:26:29.998 --> 00:26:31.866 position:44% line:83% align:start
Huh?

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.203 position:38% line:83% align:start
Sakura.

00:26:34.236 --> 00:26:37.339 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Naruto, why did
they put you in here?

00:26:37.372 --> 00:26:39.208 position:27% line:83% align:start
-I have no idea.

00:26:39.241 --> 00:26:42.344 position:10% line:83% align:start
I mean, I was only trying to
bring Kakashi Sensei back,

00:26:42.377 --> 00:26:43.879 position:5% line:83% align:start
because he was acting all weird.

00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:49.618 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Lady Tsunade told us
he left the village,

00:26:49.651 --> 00:26:53.021 position:13% line:83% align:start
that we shouldn't concern
ourselves with him anymore.

00:26:53.056 --> 00:26:53.523 position:41% line:83% align:start
-What?

00:26:53.556 --> 00:26:54.656 position:38% line:83% align:start
No way.

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:55.992 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's not right.

00:26:56.025 --> 00:26:59.028 position:10% line:83% align:start
It looked like he was being
controlled by somebody else.

00:26:59.062 --> 00:27:01.264 position:21% line:83% align:start
Giving up on someone
when they're like that,

00:27:01.297 --> 00:27:04.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
Tsunade's being weird too.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.036 position:13% line:83% align:start
-It must have something to
do with that giant illusion.

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.837 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.

00:27:07.871 --> 00:27:09.038 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're right.

00:27:09.072 --> 00:27:11.641 position:13% line:83% align:start
Kakashi Sensei said not to
go after him and that he'd

00:27:11.674 --> 00:27:14.578 position:16% line:83% align:start
protect the village even
if it cost him his life.

00:27:14.612 --> 00:27:18.082 position:19% line:83% align:start
Shikamaru said that's
Kakashi's Will of Fire.

00:27:18.115 --> 00:27:19.617 position:21% line:83% align:start
-And that means he's
out there alone,

00:27:19.649 --> 00:27:23.420 position:7% line:83% align:start
risking his life to solve this
whole crisis all by himself.

00:27:23.454 --> 00:27:24.788 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.

00:27:24.822 --> 00:27:28.292 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's right, and that's exactly
why we have to help him out.

00:27:28.325 --> 00:27:29.593 position:16% line:83% align:start
-But Lady Tsunade said--

00:27:33.532 --> 00:27:35.032 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Sakura.

00:27:35.065 --> 00:27:36.934 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.

00:27:36.967 --> 00:27:40.070 position:24% line:83% align:start
-You see the bells
by my feet there.

00:27:40.104 --> 00:27:44.075 position:5% line:83% align:start
Kakushi Sensei gave them to me.

00:27:44.109 --> 00:27:48.480 position:7% line:83% align:start
You still remember, don't you,
what he taught us back then?

00:27:48.513 --> 00:27:51.116 position:13% line:83% align:start
In the ninja world, those
who break the rules are scum,

00:27:51.149 --> 00:27:54.853 position:10% line:83% align:start
but those who abandon their
friends are worse than scum.

00:27:54.886 --> 00:27:57.689 position:19% line:83% align:start
All I want to do right
now is protect my friends.

00:27:57.722 --> 00:28:01.427 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's all I ever
wanted, even with Sasuke.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.496 position:21% line:83% align:start
I just want to bring
Kakashi Sensei back home

00:28:03.529 --> 00:28:06.299 position:16% line:83% align:start
safe and sound, to bring
him back where he belongs.

00:28:06.332 --> 00:28:09.569 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's all I want to do.

00:28:09.602 --> 00:28:13.973 position:13% line:83% align:start
SAKURA: Naruto, this is a
once in a lifetime request,

00:28:14.006 --> 00:28:15.707 position:21% line:83% align:start
just bring him home.

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:19.345 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please bring Sasuke back to me.

00:28:19.378 --> 00:28:20.614 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Don't you worry one bit.

00:28:20.647 --> 00:28:22.683 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm going to bring Sasuke back.

00:28:22.715 --> 00:28:24.651 position:24% line:83% align:start
I promise that on
my life, Sakura.

00:28:28.821 --> 00:28:31.724 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Naruto, thank you so much.

00:28:36.129 --> 00:28:41.435 position:10% line:83% align:start
TSUNADE: Naruto, you really
think you can protect him?

00:28:41.468 --> 00:28:46.440 position:19% line:83% align:start
Can you bring him back
with your own two hands?

00:28:46.473 --> 00:28:47.609 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.

00:28:47.642 --> 00:28:48.909 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm sure.

00:28:48.942 --> 00:28:52.946 position:10% line:83% align:start
I promise you I'll bring him
back safe no matter what.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:53.448 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Naruto.

00:29:00.054 --> 00:29:02.590 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why'd you go after
him by yourself?

00:29:02.624 --> 00:29:04.592 position:10% line:83% align:start
You should have come to me.

00:29:04.626 --> 00:29:07.895 position:13% line:83% align:start
I was part of the original
Team Kakashi from the start.

00:29:07.929 --> 00:29:08.429 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Now, Sakura.

00:29:15.671 --> 00:29:17.606 position:13% line:83% align:start
You went overboard again.

00:29:22.076 --> 00:29:24.046 position:24% line:83% align:start
-I understand now.

00:29:24.079 --> 00:29:26.448 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Lady Tsunade.

00:29:26.482 --> 00:29:27.916 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's Naruto, ma'am.

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:29.018 position:30% line:83% align:start
He's escaped.

00:29:29.051 --> 00:29:30.219 position:41% line:83% align:start
-What?

00:29:30.252 --> 00:29:33.522 position:21% line:83% align:start
-And it appears that
Sakura helped him do it.

00:29:33.555 --> 00:29:35.491 position:24% line:83% align:start
-If it's not one,
it's the other.

00:29:35.524 --> 00:29:38.528 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Lady Tsunade, I'm asking
you to leave this to me.

00:29:38.561 --> 00:29:39.729 position:38% line:83% align:start
Please.

00:29:39.763 --> 00:29:41.864 position:24% line:83% align:start
I know it's going
to be a real drag,

00:29:41.897 --> 00:29:44.199 position:27% line:83% align:start
but I'm the best
suited for this.

00:29:44.234 --> 00:29:45.468 position:27% line:83% align:start
TSUNADE: Agreed.

00:29:45.502 --> 00:29:47.836 position:7% line:83% align:start
You take the lead on handling
this Naruto and Sakura

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.173 position:19% line:83% align:start
situation, Shikamaru.

00:29:50.206 --> 00:29:53.043 position:5% line:83% align:start
-I'm glad that everyone's here.

00:29:53.076 --> 00:29:55.979 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now then, Lady Tsunade's
orders are for us

00:29:56.012 --> 00:29:58.048 position:5% line:83% align:start
to bring back Naruto and Sakura.

00:29:58.081 --> 00:29:59.249 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasp]

00:29:59.282 --> 00:30:00.718 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Just hold on a second.

00:30:00.751 --> 00:30:02.819 position:7% line:83% align:start
What exactly is going on here?

00:30:02.852 --> 00:30:05.656 position:24% line:83% align:start
-All of you heard
Lady Tsunade's orders.

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:09.660 position:10% line:83% align:start
Naruto and Sakura disobeyed
and went after Kakashi Sensei.

00:30:09.694 --> 00:30:12.697 position:13% line:83% align:start
-But why did Lady Tsunade
tell us not to follow him?

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:15.132 position:13% line:83% align:start
I think it is only natural
that two of the members of Team

00:30:15.166 --> 00:30:17.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
Kakashi would go to
help their sensei.

00:30:17.535 --> 00:30:19.270 position:5% line:83% align:start
-You know all you need to know.

00:30:19.303 --> 00:30:23.207 position:19% line:83% align:start
-So you say, but that
answer does not satisfy me.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.909 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Lee, let it go.

00:30:24.942 --> 00:30:26.778 position:10% line:83% align:start
They're the Hokage's orders.

00:30:26.812 --> 00:30:29.781 position:16% line:83% align:start
So I'll follow Shikamaru
as team captain.

00:30:29.815 --> 00:30:30.848 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Yes, but--

00:30:30.881 --> 00:30:32.818 position:21% line:83% align:start
-I will also comply.

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:33.884 position:44% line:83% align:start
Why?

00:30:33.918 --> 00:30:36.421 position:16% line:83% align:start
Because that is the code
of the Leaf Village.

00:30:36.455 --> 00:30:37.789 position:13% line:83% align:start
-We don't have much time.

00:30:37.823 --> 00:30:39.291 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll have to give
you the formations

00:30:39.324 --> 00:30:40.759 position:16% line:83% align:start
while we're on the move.

00:30:40.792 --> 00:30:41.360 position:35% line:83% align:start
Let's go.

00:31:04.916 --> 00:31:06.052 position:7% line:83% align:start
-The Hidden Sand's advancing.

00:31:11.391 --> 00:31:11.859 position:44% line:83% align:start
Go.

00:31:25.905 --> 00:31:29.042 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Soon we shall meet
again, Kakashi.

00:31:29.076 --> 00:31:33.046 position:13% line:83% align:start
The three of you should go
welcome our honored guest.

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:36.984 position:13% line:83% align:start
If anyone tries to get in
your way, eliminate them.

00:31:37.017 --> 00:31:39.086 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't care what it takes.

00:31:39.119 --> 00:31:39.621 position:30% line:83% align:start
GROUP: Right.

00:31:53.468 --> 00:31:55.670 position:30% line:83% align:start
-There he is.

00:31:55.703 --> 00:31:58.139 position:16% line:83% align:start
NARUTO: Kakashi Sensei.

00:31:58.173 --> 00:31:59.140 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hold on.

00:31:59.174 --> 00:31:59.774 position:35% line:83% align:start
Come back.

00:32:04.446 --> 00:32:05.748 position:35% line:83% align:start
You guys?

00:32:05.781 --> 00:32:09.317 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Naruto, Sakura, I'm under
orders to bring the two of you

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:12.153 position:5% line:83% align:start
back to the village immediately.

00:32:12.187 --> 00:32:14.423 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Someone is controlling
Kakashi Sensei.

00:32:14.457 --> 00:32:16.024 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's why he left the Leaf.

00:32:16.057 --> 00:32:17.959 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Please just let
Naruto and me go.

00:32:17.992 --> 00:32:18.928 position:44% line:83% align:start
-No.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.830 position:21% line:83% align:start
You heard what Lady
Tsunade told us.

00:32:20.863 --> 00:32:23.332 position:10% line:83% align:start
She said to forget Kakashi.

00:32:23.365 --> 00:32:24.935 position:7% line:83% align:start
Those are the Hokage's orders.

00:32:35.445 --> 00:32:36.780 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.

00:32:36.813 --> 00:32:43.153 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's true that those who disobey
the village rules are scum,

00:32:43.186 --> 00:32:49.192 position:19% line:83% align:start
but still, during our
very first lesson,

00:32:49.226 --> 00:32:51.995 position:19% line:83% align:start
Kakashi Sensei taught
us something else too,

00:32:52.028 --> 00:32:54.765 position:13% line:83% align:start
that those ninja who turn
their backs on their friends

00:32:54.799 --> 00:32:58.569 position:13% line:83% align:start
are even worse than scum.

00:32:58.603 --> 00:33:00.036 position:33% line:83% align:start
Maybe you're
different, but I don't

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:03.541 position:13% line:83% align:start
want to be worse than scum

00:33:03.574 --> 00:33:04.642 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Excuse me.

00:33:04.675 --> 00:33:06.377 position:21% line:83% align:start
So it is really true
that there is actually

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:09.213 position:19% line:83% align:start
somebody who has been
controlling Kakashi?

00:33:09.247 --> 00:33:10.348 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.

00:33:10.381 --> 00:33:13.384 position:21% line:83% align:start
But he chose to let
the enemy control him,

00:33:13.417 --> 00:33:15.419 position:24% line:83% align:start
so he could get to
the enemy from inside.

00:33:18.556 --> 00:33:20.358 position:27% line:83% align:start
-If I had known
about that, then I

00:33:20.391 --> 00:33:23.060 position:7% line:83% align:start
would have done the same thing
that Naruto and Sakura did.

00:33:23.094 --> 00:33:24.028 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Yeah, me too.

00:33:24.061 --> 00:33:25.329 position:41% line:83% align:start
[bark]

00:33:25.363 --> 00:33:28.165 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Yeah, and so
would I if I could.

00:33:28.199 --> 00:33:31.470 position:13% line:83% align:start
However, this strategy is
the only sure way for us

00:33:31.503 --> 00:33:32.404 position:21% line:83% align:start
to save the village.

00:33:35.541 --> 00:33:36.009 position:41% line:83% align:start
Move.

00:33:38.878 --> 00:33:40.612 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Now's our chance, Naruto.

00:33:40.646 --> 00:33:41.881 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Right.

00:33:41.915 --> 00:33:45.484 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Why those little-- Neji,
I'm leaving this to you.

00:33:45.517 --> 00:33:46.051 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Right.

00:33:46.084 --> 00:33:47.554 position:27% line:83% align:start
We'll handle it.

00:33:47.587 --> 00:33:48.387 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Hold it.

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:50.890 position:5% line:83% align:start
I haven't finished with you yet.

00:33:50.924 --> 00:33:52.057 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm not letting you leave.

00:33:54.861 --> 00:33:58.197 position:7% line:83% align:start
Summoning Double-Headed Snake.

00:33:58.231 --> 00:34:01.634 position:30% line:83% align:start
Snake Net go!

00:34:01.668 --> 00:34:02.569 position:30% line:83% align:start
-What's that?

00:34:02.602 --> 00:34:03.603 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Does it matter?

00:34:03.636 --> 00:34:04.304 position:38% line:83% align:start
Just go.

00:34:10.577 --> 00:34:11.544 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Kunai Bomb.

00:34:17.818 --> 00:34:18.986 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Be careful.

00:34:19.019 --> 00:34:22.189 position:24% line:83% align:start
He has an enormous
amount of chakra.

00:34:22.222 --> 00:34:23.324 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Well, well.

00:34:23.357 --> 00:34:25.026 position:16% line:83% align:start
Looks like you actually
know what you're doing.

00:34:33.601 --> 00:34:34.970 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Another gate?

00:34:35.003 --> 00:34:39.239 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Kakashi Sensei must
have passed through here.

00:34:39.273 --> 00:34:41.241 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Well, it's about time.

00:34:41.275 --> 00:34:44.346 position:7% line:83% align:start
My two cuties and I have been
waiting practically forever

00:34:44.379 --> 00:34:46.448 position:24% line:83% align:start
for you to arrive.

00:34:46.481 --> 00:34:49.751 position:19% line:83% align:start
They want payback for
the last time you fought.

00:34:52.654 --> 00:34:54.122 position:21% line:83% align:start
-That's fine by me.

00:34:54.155 --> 00:34:55.624 position:10% line:83% align:start
I got a score to settle too.

00:34:55.657 --> 00:34:56.892 position:33% line:83% align:start
Bring it on.

00:34:56.926 --> 00:34:58.894 position:19% line:83% align:start
-You should keep those
pets of yours on a leash,

00:34:58.928 --> 00:35:00.295 position:16% line:83% align:start
so they don't get hurt.

00:35:00.328 --> 00:35:03.532 position:21% line:83% align:start
-You don't see dogs
like that every day.

00:35:03.566 --> 00:35:05.233 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hinata, talk to me.

00:35:05.266 --> 00:35:07.536 position:27% line:83% align:start
-I'm seeing the
same type of chakra

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:09.839 position:24% line:83% align:start
that I'd see in a
trained ninja hound.

00:35:09.872 --> 00:35:12.842 position:19% line:83% align:start
-It's clear that those
two are not normal dogs.

00:35:12.875 --> 00:35:13.876 position:44% line:83% align:start
Why?

00:35:13.909 --> 00:35:15.478 position:24% line:83% align:start
Because they don't
look like normal dogs.

00:35:15.511 --> 00:35:18.115 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Man, you really just have
to drain the cool right out

00:35:18.147 --> 00:35:20.050 position:13% line:83% align:start
of everything, don't you?

00:35:20.083 --> 00:35:23.020 position:27% line:83% align:start
Naruto, Sakura,
look, I don't really

00:35:23.053 --> 00:35:25.722 position:5% line:83% align:start
know whether what you're trying
to do here is right or wrong.

00:35:25.756 --> 00:35:27.824 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's not for me to say.

00:35:27.858 --> 00:35:31.528 position:27% line:83% align:start
However, I sure
know how you feel.

00:35:31.561 --> 00:35:32.929 position:21% line:83% align:start
No doubt about that.

00:35:32.963 --> 00:35:34.131 position:41% line:83% align:start
[bark]

00:35:34.163 --> 00:35:39.269 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Naruto, Sakura, I don't
think you're wrong at all.

00:35:39.302 --> 00:35:40.404 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Thanks, guys.

00:35:40.437 --> 00:35:43.041 position:24% line:83% align:start
That means a lot.

00:35:43.074 --> 00:35:44.942 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Didn't I say
we've been waiting?

00:35:44.976 --> 00:35:46.576 position:16% line:83% align:start
Quit talking and fight.

00:35:50.048 --> 00:35:52.984 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Regardless of my personal
opinion about all this,

00:35:53.017 --> 00:35:55.753 position:13% line:83% align:start
we'll keep them busy here.

00:35:55.787 --> 00:35:57.121 position:44% line:83% align:start
Why?

00:35:57.155 --> 00:36:01.292 position:16% line:83% align:start
Because we have a beast
specialist in our team.

00:36:01.325 --> 00:36:02.627 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Let's go, Akamaru.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:03.795 position:41% line:83% align:start
[bark]

00:36:03.828 --> 00:36:04.829 position:13% line:83% align:start
Man Beast Transformation.

00:36:09.534 --> 00:36:13.404 position:27% line:83% align:start
Fang Over Fang.

00:36:13.438 --> 00:36:13.906 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Fools.

00:36:17.341 --> 00:36:18.043 position:35% line:83% align:start
All right.

00:36:18.077 --> 00:36:18.811 position:38% line:83% align:start
Now go.

00:36:18.844 --> 00:36:20.913 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Kiba.

00:36:20.946 --> 00:36:23.449 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Hey, wait, Naruto.

00:36:23.482 --> 00:36:24.850 position:13% line:83% align:start
-They're all yours, Kiba.

00:36:28.121 --> 00:36:28.854 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Go on.

00:36:28.887 --> 00:36:29.922 position:33% line:83% align:start
We got this.

00:36:29.955 --> 00:36:31.091 position:21% line:83% align:start
-What are you doing?

00:36:31.124 --> 00:36:32.324 position:30% line:83% align:start
Go after them.

00:36:32.357 --> 00:36:33.325 position:30% line:83% align:start
-It's no use.

00:36:43.737 --> 00:36:45.672 position:13% line:83% align:start
Just their master remains.

00:36:45.705 --> 00:36:47.640 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Let's go.

00:36:47.674 --> 00:36:50.977 position:30% line:83% align:start
-My servants.

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:52.146 position:35% line:83% align:start
You dare!

00:36:52.179 --> 00:36:52.645 position:35% line:83% align:start
Summoning.

00:36:58.119 --> 00:36:58.953 position:30% line:83% align:start
Chimera Jutsu.

00:37:01.588 --> 00:37:02.189 position:30% line:83% align:start
-She's coming.

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:12.500 position:5% line:83% align:start
-And now, the real fight begins.

00:37:28.282 --> 00:37:31.352 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Naruto, just listen to me.

00:37:31.385 --> 00:37:33.722 position:19% line:83% align:start
The enemy's coming at
us, one after another.

00:37:33.755 --> 00:37:37.959 position:7% line:83% align:start
That just proves that Kakashi
is crucial to their scheme.

00:37:37.993 --> 00:37:40.829 position:21% line:83% align:start
In other words, it's
exactly as he planned.

00:37:40.862 --> 00:37:42.397 position:27% line:83% align:start
If we just stick
to his strategy.

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:43.832 position:16% line:83% align:start
We'll defeat this enemy.

00:37:43.865 --> 00:37:44.699 position:30% line:83% align:start
-I don't care.

00:37:44.733 --> 00:37:46.868 position:13% line:83% align:start
That doesn't matter to me.

00:37:46.902 --> 00:37:49.038 position:21% line:83% align:start
-That stubborn idiot
just doesn't get it.

00:38:06.689 --> 00:38:08.825 position:30% line:83% align:start
I want to save
Kakashi Sensei too.

00:38:08.858 --> 00:38:10.560 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't you know that.

00:38:10.593 --> 00:38:13.596 position:7% line:83% align:start
But I can't sacrifice everyone
in the village for one man.

00:38:16.499 --> 00:38:19.136 position:13% line:83% align:start
-I'll just leave them with
that as a greeting for now.

00:38:19.169 --> 00:38:23.339 position:5% line:83% align:start
But next time, I'll aim straight
at them, and I won't miss.

00:38:23.372 --> 00:38:24.975 position:5% line:83% align:start
Whose blood shall I spill first?

00:38:34.384 --> 00:38:37.989 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Naruto, Sakura, jump on board.

00:38:38.022 --> 00:38:38.957 position:35% line:83% align:start
-It's Sai.

00:38:45.697 --> 00:38:48.066 position:19% line:83% align:start
-They left us behind.

00:38:48.099 --> 00:38:49.868 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Damn you, Sai.

00:38:49.901 --> 00:38:51.669 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Blinding me won't
help for long.

00:38:55.073 --> 00:38:58.244 position:7% line:83% align:start
I could have sworn there were
more of them a moment ago.

00:38:58.277 --> 00:39:00.045 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Shikamaru, what now?

00:39:00.079 --> 00:39:02.513 position:7% line:83% align:start
-I suppose we could tell this
guy that we're not the enemy.

00:39:02.547 --> 00:39:05.717 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I have a suspicion
he wouldn't believe us.

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:06.417 position:33% line:83% align:start
-All right.

00:39:06.451 --> 00:39:08.153 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then let's start again.

00:39:08.187 --> 00:39:13.058 position:13% line:83% align:start
-In that case, we have no
choice but to defeat him.

00:39:13.092 --> 00:39:16.695 position:19% line:83% align:start
But we can't take too
long, so hit him hard.

00:39:26.339 --> 00:39:27.840 position:13% line:83% align:start
-It's much too windy here.

00:39:27.873 --> 00:39:30.076 position:30% line:83% align:start
We better land
while we still can.

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:31.044 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Got it.

00:39:37.951 --> 00:39:40.587 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Sai, thanks for coming.

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.555 position:30% line:83% align:start
-You saved us.

00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:46.360 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Well, I am a member of
Team Kakashi too after all.

00:39:46.394 --> 00:39:48.595 position:30% line:83% align:start
Do you think I
could go with you?

00:39:48.628 --> 00:39:49.863 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Yeah, of course.

00:39:49.896 --> 00:39:50.997 position:30% line:83% align:start
Right, Naruto.

00:39:51.032 --> 00:39:52.099 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Sure.

00:39:52.133 --> 00:39:54.001 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you take to heart
what Kakashi teaches,

00:39:54.035 --> 00:39:57.038 position:30% line:83% align:start
then you are a
member of the team.

00:39:57.071 --> 00:39:59.506 position:10% line:83% align:start
SAI (VOICEOVER): I knew it.

00:39:59.539 --> 00:40:01.809 position:5% line:83% align:start
COVERGIRL (VOICEOVER): Hi there.

00:40:01.842 --> 00:40:03.443 position:16% line:83% align:start
BOTH: A girl's feelings?

00:40:03.476 --> 00:40:06.415 position:19% line:83% align:start
-My book says pursuing
someone in this situation

00:40:06.447 --> 00:40:08.482 position:7% line:83% align:start
is certain to be appreciated.

00:40:08.516 --> 00:40:09.517 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Oh, you were faking.

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:11.085 position:19% line:83% align:start
Isn't that just great?

00:40:11.118 --> 00:40:12.453 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.

00:40:12.486 --> 00:40:13.754 position:13% line:83% align:start
And you dropped your book.

00:40:16.425 --> 00:40:19.294 position:7% line:83% align:start
-That protects you very well,
but only playing defense

00:40:19.328 --> 00:40:20.494 position:13% line:83% align:start
won't win you this battle.

00:40:20.528 --> 00:40:21.163 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Fine.

00:40:21.196 --> 00:40:22.798 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then I will attack you.

00:40:29.972 --> 00:40:33.208 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Snake Rapid Thorn.

00:40:33.241 --> 00:40:35.477 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Rotation

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:37.579 position:27% line:83% align:start
-We could go on
like this forever.

00:40:37.612 --> 00:40:40.549 position:5% line:83% align:start
We have to find a way to attack
and defend at the same time.

00:40:40.582 --> 00:40:42.952 position:7% line:83% align:start
NEJI (VOICEOVER): My rotation
and his Snake's Regeneration

00:40:42.986 --> 00:40:44.653 position:21% line:83% align:start
are evenly matched.

00:40:44.686 --> 00:40:46.055 position:5% line:83% align:start
Unless I can increase my speed.

00:40:46.089 --> 00:40:47.357 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can't attack.

00:40:50.059 --> 00:40:52.729 position:7% line:83% align:start
Lee, use Primary Lotus on me.

00:40:52.762 --> 00:40:53.963 position:24% line:83% align:start
Tenten, cover us.

00:40:53.997 --> 00:40:54.931 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Roger that.

00:40:54.964 --> 00:40:56.833 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Use Primary?

00:40:56.866 --> 00:40:58.101 position:30% line:83% align:start
Oh, I get it.

00:40:58.134 --> 00:41:00.870 position:30% line:83% align:start
-It's no use.

00:41:00.903 --> 00:41:01.871 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Want to bet.

00:41:04.907 --> 00:41:06.143 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Here we go.

00:41:06.176 --> 00:41:07.910 position:30% line:83% align:start
Primary Lotus.

00:41:07.945 --> 00:41:09.346 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Eight Trigrams Palm Rotation.

00:41:13.283 --> 00:41:14.218 position:33% line:83% align:start
-That's it?

00:41:17.855 --> 00:41:18.322 position:41% line:83% align:start
What?

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:30.068 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Take this.

00:41:39.543 --> 00:41:40.712 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ha.

00:41:40.745 --> 00:41:43.081 position:13% line:83% align:start
A creature that big can't
keep up with our speed.

00:41:43.114 --> 00:41:45.316 position:33% line:83% align:start
So you lose.

00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:48.186 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Be quiet, you Leaf lapdog.

00:41:48.219 --> 00:41:48.686 position:44% line:83% align:start
Die!

00:41:57.695 --> 00:41:59.298 position:16% line:83% align:start
That was a cheap trick.

00:41:59.331 --> 00:42:01.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
-But an effective one.

00:42:01.067 --> 00:42:03.135 position:27% line:83% align:start
Kiba and Hinata
got your attention,

00:42:03.169 --> 00:42:05.171 position:16% line:83% align:start
and you forgot about me.

00:42:05.204 --> 00:42:08.274 position:16% line:83% align:start
Thanks to them I've had
plenty of time to work.

00:42:08.307 --> 00:42:10.576 position:24% line:83% align:start
-You think I'll be
held by a mere pitfall.

00:42:10.609 --> 00:42:13.513 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Is my presence
that hard to see?

00:42:13.547 --> 00:42:16.816 position:33% line:83% align:start
[squeaking]

00:42:20.187 --> 00:42:22.189 position:35% line:83% align:start
-The bug.

00:42:22.222 --> 00:42:22.822 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Beetle Sphere.

00:42:30.363 --> 00:42:34.034 position:10% line:83% align:start
-It's been awhile, but let's
try the Ino-Shika-Cho formation.

00:42:34.067 --> 00:42:36.937 position:35% line:83% align:start
BOTH: OK.

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:38.905 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Super Expansion Jutsu.

00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:50.784 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Mind Transfer Jutsu.

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:00.394 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Nice.

00:43:00.428 --> 00:43:01.463 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's over now.

00:43:04.533 --> 00:43:07.402 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ino, I want you relate
what I tell you.

00:43:07.436 --> 00:43:10.072 position:10% line:83% align:start
Tell him that our job is to
bring Naruto and Sakura back

00:43:10.105 --> 00:43:13.542 position:5% line:83% align:start
to the village and that we don't
need to fight him to do that.

00:43:13.575 --> 00:43:17.779 position:19% line:83% align:start
Then find out from him
where Kakashi is going.

00:43:17.813 --> 00:43:18.780 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Got it.

00:43:18.814 --> 00:43:20.649 position:24% line:83% align:start
I know where he's
heading all right.

00:43:20.682 --> 00:43:23.719 position:16% line:83% align:start
But you're going to have
to work a whole lot harder

00:43:23.752 --> 00:43:25.921 position:24% line:83% align:start
to find that out.

00:43:25.954 --> 00:43:26.422 position:41% line:83% align:start
-What?

00:43:30.159 --> 00:43:30.859 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Shikamaru, move.

00:43:30.893 --> 00:43:31.361 position:35% line:83% align:start
Get back.

00:43:34.763 --> 00:43:35.565 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Summoning Jutsu.

00:43:39.169 --> 00:43:40.036 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now, seriously?

00:43:45.074 --> 00:43:45.542 position:41% line:83% align:start
-What?

00:43:48.378 --> 00:43:48.945 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Chimera Jutsu.

00:43:57.887 --> 00:43:58.355 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Whoa.

00:43:58.389 --> 00:43:59.722 position:33% line:83% align:start
What's that?

00:43:59.756 --> 00:44:01.192 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Guess he didn't listen.

00:44:01.225 --> 00:44:02.359 position:21% line:83% align:start
So we have to fight.

00:44:19.176 --> 00:44:20.811 position:7% line:83% align:start
How many times must I say it?

00:44:20.844 --> 00:44:22.247 position:19% line:83% align:start
We're not your enemy.

00:45:14.167 --> 00:45:16.703 position:21% line:83% align:start
-I should have known
that wouldn't get you.

00:45:16.737 --> 00:45:21.241 position:13% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't expect anything
less from you, Gaara.

00:45:21.275 --> 00:45:23.577 position:19% line:83% align:start
We know what to expect
from Kakashi too.

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:27.014 position:10% line:83% align:start
With his Will of Fire, he'd
give his life without hesitation

00:45:27.047 --> 00:45:28.482 position:13% line:83% align:start
to try and save the Leaf.

00:45:28.515 --> 00:45:30.250 position:33% line:83% align:start
Wouldn't he?

00:45:30.284 --> 00:45:34.021 position:21% line:83% align:start
-He would, but would
that defeat Hiruko?

00:45:34.054 --> 00:45:34.988 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.

00:45:35.022 --> 00:45:36.324 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm sure of it.

00:45:36.357 --> 00:45:42.630 position:10% line:83% align:start
Or perhaps, Naruto might be
able to stop this enemy too.

00:45:42.664 --> 00:45:43.830 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Naruto could?

00:45:43.864 --> 00:45:46.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
-I know he still has a
long way to go as a ninja.

00:45:46.934 --> 00:45:49.270 position:21% line:83% align:start
But when it comes to
having a ton of guts

00:45:49.304 --> 00:45:51.640 position:21% line:83% align:start
and never giving up,
he's the one person

00:45:51.674 --> 00:45:55.243 position:10% line:83% align:start
who can follow my ninja way.

00:45:55.276 --> 00:45:56.712 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's up to you
whether or not you

00:45:56.745 --> 00:45:58.279 position:24% line:83% align:start
choose to believe
in him as well.

00:46:18.735 --> 00:46:21.036 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Lady Tsunade, please,
you have to come inside,

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:23.272 position:13% line:83% align:start
or they could target you.

00:46:23.305 --> 00:46:23.839 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yes.

00:46:23.872 --> 00:46:24.607 position:33% line:83% align:start
I know that.

00:46:51.335 --> 00:46:54.438 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Now, now, hold it right there.

00:46:54.472 --> 00:46:56.807 position:19% line:83% align:start
People of the Village
Hidden in the Sand,

00:46:56.841 --> 00:47:00.911 position:13% line:83% align:start
I bring you word that your
Kazekage is safe and unharmed.

00:47:00.945 --> 00:47:03.981 position:7% line:83% align:start
And what's more, I've brought
a message from him as well.

00:47:08.419 --> 00:47:09.086 position:24% line:83% align:start
KANKURO: That's--

00:47:13.558 --> 00:47:14.659 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Enough.

00:47:14.693 --> 00:47:17.829 position:16% line:83% align:start
Lord Kazekage's ordered
an immediate ceasefire.

00:47:17.863 --> 00:47:20.265 position:30% line:83% align:start
GROUP: Right.

00:47:20.298 --> 00:47:23.769 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Jiraiya, so where is Gaara now?

00:47:23.802 --> 00:47:24.536 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Where is he?

00:47:24.569 --> 00:47:26.071 position:27% line:83% align:start
I have no clue.

00:47:26.104 --> 00:47:28.006 position:30% line:83% align:start
I only know as
much as I told you.

00:47:49.495 --> 00:47:51.731 position:7% line:83% align:start
-What's with this sand storm?

00:47:51.764 --> 00:47:52.866 position:27% line:83% align:start
-My eyes sting.

00:48:11.951 --> 00:48:13.821 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hey, it's Gaara.

00:48:13.854 --> 00:48:16.825 position:21% line:83% align:start
You came to help us.

00:48:16.858 --> 00:48:21.796 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Naruto, I'm afraid I can't let
you go any farther than this.

00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:23.130 position:41% line:83% align:start
-What?

00:48:23.163 --> 00:48:27.000 position:7% line:83% align:start
-It's against Kakashi's wishes
to let you get past here.

00:48:27.034 --> 00:48:29.471 position:33% line:83% align:start
-But Gaara.

00:48:29.504 --> 00:48:30.839 position:19% line:83% align:start
-What are you saying?

00:48:30.872 --> 00:48:33.441 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can't let him face this alone.

00:48:33.475 --> 00:48:38.213 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Don't you have respect
for Kakashi's feelings?

00:48:38.246 --> 00:48:39.681 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Get out of our way.

00:48:39.714 --> 00:48:40.682 position:38% line:83% align:start
[scream]

00:48:59.301 --> 00:49:00.001 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Naruto.

00:49:00.034 --> 00:49:01.002 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Let us help you.

00:49:01.035 --> 00:49:02.505 position:10% line:83% align:start
-You guys just go on ahead.

00:49:14.951 --> 00:49:17.921 position:30% line:83% align:start
-You need us.

00:49:17.954 --> 00:49:19.255 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Kakashi needs you.

00:49:19.288 --> 00:49:21.558 position:16% line:83% align:start
You can't let him go on
his own, no matter what.

00:49:37.608 --> 00:49:39.442 position:7% line:83% align:start
Why are you trying to stop us?

00:49:39.476 --> 00:49:40.243 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't understand.

00:50:01.867 --> 00:50:03.001 position:10% line:83% align:start
-You told me something once.

00:50:07.171 --> 00:50:09.374 position:13% line:83% align:start
You said that you wouldn't
let the people that

00:50:09.408 --> 00:50:12.076 position:21% line:83% align:start
are close to you get
hurt, that you would even

00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:13.779 position:21% line:83% align:start
give your very life
to protect them.

00:50:19.251 --> 00:50:22.154 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's just what Kakashi
is doing, sacrificing

00:50:22.187 --> 00:50:23.957 position:10% line:83% align:start
himself to protect everyone.

00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.891 position:27% line:83% align:start
-But it's wrong.

00:50:24.924 --> 00:50:26.258 position:21% line:83% align:start
He doesn't have to.

00:50:26.291 --> 00:50:28.995 position:24% line:83% align:start
I won't let him go
through with this plan.

00:50:29.028 --> 00:50:31.698 position:13% line:83% align:start
I won't let him or anyone
become a sacrifice.

00:50:37.971 --> 00:50:41.774 position:21% line:83% align:start
-That's no more than
a naive dream, Naruto.

00:50:41.808 --> 00:50:43.443 position:27% line:83% align:start
We simply don't
have the strength

00:50:43.476 --> 00:50:47.580 position:16% line:83% align:start
to turn that idealistic
hope into a reality.

00:50:47.614 --> 00:50:51.719 position:16% line:83% align:start
I am the Kazekage of the
Village Hidden in the Sand.

00:50:51.752 --> 00:50:54.187 position:16% line:83% align:start
Right now, the lives of
everyone in my village

00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:58.058 position:16% line:83% align:start
depend on me, so I won't
be swayed by your ideals.

00:51:08.802 --> 00:51:09.904 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Why, Gaara?

00:51:09.938 --> 00:51:11.873 position:13% line:83% align:start
Why can't you understand?

00:51:11.906 --> 00:51:15.576 position:13% line:83% align:start
Kakashi Sensei's life, the
lives of all the villagers,

00:51:15.609 --> 00:51:17.612 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can't weigh one
against the other.

00:51:17.646 --> 00:51:30.659 position:13% line:83% align:start
The only thing that I want
is to protect Kakashi Sensei.

00:51:54.717 --> 00:51:56.018 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why don't you get that?

00:52:28.552 --> 00:52:32.623 position:7% line:83% align:start
-There's no opening for me to
unleash my parasitic insects.

00:52:32.657 --> 00:52:34.826 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Tenten, can you
bring out a chain?

00:52:34.859 --> 00:52:35.526 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Sure.

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:36.794 position:27% line:83% align:start
What's the plan?

00:52:36.828 --> 00:52:38.396 position:10% line:83% align:start
-First, stop it from flying.

00:52:38.429 --> 00:52:38.896 position:38% line:83% align:start
Scatter.

00:52:45.137 --> 00:52:45.937 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Good.

00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:47.106 position:7% line:83% align:start
Now, everyone pull the chains.

00:52:50.608 --> 00:52:52.610 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Its feathers are paper bombs.

00:52:52.643 --> 00:52:53.478 position:33% line:83% align:start
What a pain.

00:52:53.511 --> 00:52:56.081 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Now, Shikamaru,
go after Naruto.

00:52:56.115 --> 00:52:57.315 position:41% line:83% align:start
-What?

00:52:57.348 --> 00:52:58.817 position:16% line:83% align:start
-It's going to take us a
while to defeat this thing,

00:52:58.851 --> 00:53:01.186 position:21% line:83% align:start
even with all of us
working together as a team.

00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:03.321 position:21% line:83% align:start
Besides, we can tell
what you're thinking.

00:53:03.354 --> 00:53:06.625 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's written all over your face.

00:53:06.658 --> 00:53:08.727 position:5% line:83% align:start
-I understand Naruto's feelings.

00:53:08.761 --> 00:53:11.563 position:19% line:83% align:start
But to a ninja of the
village, the Hokage's orders

00:53:11.597 --> 00:53:12.831 position:30% line:83% align:start
are absolute.

00:53:12.865 --> 00:53:15.168 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Just go, and leave this to us.

00:53:15.201 --> 00:53:17.070 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now, Shikamaru.

00:53:17.103 --> 00:53:18.037 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Help, Naruto.

00:53:18.071 --> 00:53:20.372 position:35% line:83% align:start
Byakugan.

00:53:20.405 --> 00:53:21.306 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Quick.

00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:23.375 position:27% line:83% align:start
While we've got
this guy restrained.

00:53:23.408 --> 00:53:24.376 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Shikamaru.

00:53:24.409 --> 00:53:26.813 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Go protect the village.

00:53:26.846 --> 00:53:29.716 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Are you sure?

00:53:29.749 --> 00:53:31.217 position:13% line:83% align:start
Man, this is such a drag.

00:53:33.853 --> 00:53:37.624 position:13% line:83% align:start
This one's all yours then.

00:53:37.657 --> 00:53:38.092 position:38% line:83% align:start
Dammit.

00:53:57.011 --> 00:53:57.478 position:41% line:83% align:start
Gaara?

00:54:03.617 --> 00:54:05.187 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Naruto is gone.

00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:06.787 position:41% line:83% align:start
-What?

00:54:06.821 --> 00:54:09.958 position:16% line:83% align:start
Don't tell me that even
you couldn't stop him.

00:54:09.991 --> 00:54:12.761 position:27% line:83% align:start
-I heard most of
it from Jiraiya.

00:54:12.794 --> 00:54:15.429 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you look at it
logically, Kakashi's plan

00:54:15.462 --> 00:54:19.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
is the only sure way
to defeat the enemy.

00:54:19.401 --> 00:54:21.102 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Yeah, of course, it is.

00:54:21.136 --> 00:54:23.705 position:16% line:83% align:start
-It's been awhile since
I fought with Naruto,

00:54:23.738 --> 00:54:25.540 position:30% line:83% align:start
and again, the
strength of his heart

00:54:25.574 --> 00:54:28.777 position:21% line:83% align:start
and the depth of his
caring touched me.

00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:32.581 position:13% line:83% align:start
Not even for a second did
his determination waver,

00:54:32.614 --> 00:54:35.684 position:21% line:83% align:start
nor did his devotion
to his ninja way.

00:54:35.718 --> 00:54:38.821 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now, I see why Jiraiya
thinks Naruto could actually

00:54:38.855 --> 00:54:40.690 position:30% line:83% align:start
pull this off.

00:54:40.723 --> 00:54:42.525 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Sometimes, I envy
people who can

00:54:42.558 --> 00:54:45.494 position:19% line:83% align:start
follow their heart as
strongly as he does.

00:54:45.528 --> 00:54:48.664 position:16% line:83% align:start
But both of us know this
isn't the time for that.

00:54:48.698 --> 00:54:51.534 position:19% line:83% align:start
Asuma entrusted me to
keep the king safe.

00:54:51.567 --> 00:54:53.803 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have to preserve the
future of the village.

00:54:53.836 --> 00:54:55.105 position:5% line:83% align:start
The children must be protected.

00:55:03.614 --> 00:55:07.818 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm going to stop Naruto,
even if I have to kill him.

00:55:25.469 --> 00:55:33.845 position:7% line:83% align:start
-It's that place from before.

00:55:39.851 --> 00:55:42.987 position:27% line:83% align:start
Kakashi Sensei,
where are you going?

00:55:48.093 --> 00:55:49.061 position:30% line:83% align:start
What, Sakura?

00:55:49.094 --> 00:55:50.195 position:30% line:83% align:start
What's wrong?

00:55:50.229 --> 00:55:51.397 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Just look down there.

00:55:56.135 --> 00:55:58.003 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Kakashi Sensei!

00:55:58.037 --> 00:56:00.039 position:7% line:83% align:start
Why didn't you guys stop him?

00:56:00.072 --> 00:56:02.675 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Calling out to him
isn't going to help.

00:56:02.708 --> 00:56:03.209 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yes.

00:56:03.243 --> 00:56:04.277 position:33% line:83% align:start
She's right.

00:56:04.311 --> 00:56:06.079 position:19% line:83% align:start
He's completely under
the enemy's jutsu.

00:56:12.319 --> 00:56:13.253 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Kakashi, stop.

00:56:15.956 --> 00:56:19.092 position:27% line:83% align:start
Kakashi Sensei,
please answer me.

00:56:19.125 --> 00:56:20.459 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't you know me.

00:56:20.492 --> 00:56:20.961 position:41% line:83% align:start
Wait.

00:56:20.994 --> 00:56:21.795 position:35% line:83% align:start
Just stop.

00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:30.103 position:24% line:83% align:start
Did you see that?

00:56:30.137 --> 00:56:32.406 position:16% line:83% align:start
-A timed jutsu formula.

00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:34.541 position:27% line:83% align:start
Even if he's not
conscious, the jutsu

00:56:34.574 --> 00:56:37.477 position:13% line:83% align:start
will go off automatically.

00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:39.880 position:19% line:83% align:start
-But Sai, doesn't that
basically make him

00:56:39.914 --> 00:56:41.648 position:16% line:83% align:start
into a living time bomb?

00:56:41.682 --> 00:56:45.286 position:13% line:83% align:start
-It's hardly even used in
ANBU, even as a last resort.

00:56:45.319 --> 00:56:46.287 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Wait.

00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:49.190 position:16% line:83% align:start
Kakashi Sensei willingly
agreed to that?

00:56:49.223 --> 00:56:52.093 position:16% line:83% align:start
SHIKAMARU: That's right.

00:56:52.126 --> 00:56:55.997 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Shikamaru, you knew
about this all along?

00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:57.466 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.

00:56:57.498 --> 00:56:59.533 position:21% line:83% align:start
Lady Tsunade placed
that jutsu on him.

00:57:04.906 --> 00:57:07.142 position:21% line:83% align:start
When Hiruko tries to
absorb the kekkei genkai,

00:57:07.175 --> 00:57:09.277 position:21% line:83% align:start
he'll be defenseless
for an instant.

00:57:09.311 --> 00:57:12.314 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's when the Mangekyo
Sharingan will activate.

00:57:12.347 --> 00:57:14.384 position:21% line:83% align:start
And that will be the
end of the enemy who

00:57:14.417 --> 00:57:17.119 position:30% line:83% align:start
can absorb any
type of ninja art.

00:57:17.152 --> 00:57:19.455 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's the only way.

00:57:19.489 --> 00:57:23.026 position:16% line:83% align:start
-You mean Granny Tsunade
was willing to sacrifice

00:57:23.059 --> 00:57:25.827 position:24% line:83% align:start
Kakashi right from
the very start?

00:57:25.861 --> 00:57:29.799 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't believe it.

00:57:29.832 --> 00:57:31.768 position:24% line:83% align:start
SHIKAMARU: Do you
understand now?

00:57:31.801 --> 00:57:35.905 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's Kakashi
Sensei's Will of Fire.

00:57:35.938 --> 00:57:36.806 position:38% line:83% align:start
-No way.

00:57:36.839 --> 00:57:38.641 position:27% line:83% align:start
I won't let him.

00:57:38.674 --> 00:57:39.376 position:33% line:83% align:start
You hear me.

00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:40.743 position:38% line:83% align:start
I won't.

00:57:40.777 --> 00:57:44.080 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Naruto, no matter how loud you
yell, he can't hear you now.

00:57:44.113 --> 00:57:45.648 position:16% line:83% align:start
-I'll make him hear me.

00:57:45.681 --> 00:57:46.283 position:44% line:83% align:start
-No.

00:57:46.316 --> 00:57:47.151 position:41% line:83% align:start
Wait.

00:57:47.184 --> 00:57:48.252 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Kakashi Sensei!

00:57:59.963 --> 00:58:03.300 position:16% line:83% align:start
HIRUKO: It's been quite
a while, Kakashi Hatake.

00:58:03.333 --> 00:58:06.337 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've been waiting
most impatiently.

00:58:06.371 --> 00:58:09.573 position:27% line:83% align:start
Soon, the solar
eclipse will begin.

00:58:09.606 --> 00:58:10.741 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Hey, you.

00:58:10.774 --> 00:58:12.843 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're the one who
did this to Kakashi.

00:58:12.876 --> 00:58:14.045 position:30% line:83% align:start
Why would you?

00:58:14.079 --> 00:58:16.081 position:16% line:83% align:start
What do you have against
the Leaf Village anyway?

00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:23.855 position:24% line:83% align:start
HIRUKO: There was
once a man named

00:58:23.888 --> 00:58:27.258 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hiruko who lived in the
Hidden Leaf Village.

00:58:27.292 --> 00:58:29.794 position:21% line:83% align:start
That man dreamed of
a day like today.

00:58:29.828 --> 00:58:31.564 position:13% line:83% align:start
He planned for it in fact.

00:58:31.596 --> 00:58:33.164 position:24% line:83% align:start
He made it happen.

00:58:33.198 --> 00:58:36.668 position:13% line:83% align:start
So long, long ago, he cast
the Cursed Puppet Master Jutsu

00:58:36.701 --> 00:58:37.369 position:33% line:83% align:start
on Kakashi.

00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:47.780 position:27% line:83% align:start
But even further
back, before that day,

00:58:47.813 --> 00:58:50.649 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hiruko's closest friends
were Jiraiya, Tsunade,

00:58:50.683 --> 00:58:54.687 position:21% line:83% align:start
and Orochimaru, the
legendary Sannin.

00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:57.424 position:27% line:83% align:start
However, unlike
the three of them,

00:58:57.457 --> 00:59:01.861 position:19% line:83% align:start
he did not possess any
exceptional talent as a ninja.

00:59:01.894 --> 00:59:03.896 position:24% line:83% align:start
In order to find a
way to compensate

00:59:03.929 --> 00:59:08.902 position:7% line:83% align:start
for his own physical weakness,
he absorbed himself in research

00:59:08.935 --> 00:59:11.004 position:21% line:83% align:start
and tried to perfect
the Body Synthesis

00:59:11.037 --> 00:59:12.272 position:10% line:83% align:start
Jutsu known as the Chimera.

00:59:15.742 --> 00:59:18.613 position:16% line:83% align:start
And that was back during
The Third Great Ninja War.

00:59:18.645 --> 00:59:20.780 position:27% line:83% align:start
The fighting was
especially fierce

00:59:20.814 --> 00:59:25.085 position:24% line:83% align:start
in the area around
Kannabi Bridge.

00:59:25.118 --> 00:59:27.622 position:38% line:83% align:start
-My eye.

00:59:27.654 --> 00:59:28.922 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Kakashi, are you all right?

00:59:34.929 --> 00:59:38.132 position:16% line:83% align:start
-But there's no way that
you could have seen me.

00:59:44.839 --> 00:59:46.207 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Run for the exit.

00:59:49.211 --> 00:59:50.479 position:10% line:83% align:start
A blind spot on my left eye.

00:59:57.319 --> 00:59:59.354 position:21% line:83% align:start
You guys all right?

00:59:59.388 --> 01:00:00.789 position:27% line:83% align:start
I mean Kakashi?

01:00:05.227 --> 01:00:07.129 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Obito!

01:00:07.162 --> 01:00:11.301 position:5% line:83% align:start
HIRUKO: Kakashi Hatake survived
and came home from that battle,

01:00:11.334 --> 01:00:14.470 position:21% line:83% align:start
and he brought with
him quite a surprise.

01:00:14.504 --> 01:00:16.206 position:30% line:83% align:start
He returned in
possession of a new

01:00:16.239 --> 01:00:19.342 position:7% line:83% align:start
found power, a kekkei genkai.

01:00:19.375 --> 01:00:23.179 position:13% line:83% align:start
He obtained the Sharingan
from Obito Uchiha,

01:00:23.213 --> 01:00:25.448 position:24% line:83% align:start
who was killed in
that fierce fighting.

01:00:25.481 --> 01:00:28.251 position:7% line:83% align:start
And I thought, yes, that's it.

01:00:33.490 --> 01:00:35.825 position:24% line:83% align:start
If I could use the
Chimera Jutsu to make

01:00:35.858 --> 01:00:38.262 position:27% line:83% align:start
the power of the
kekkei genkai mine,

01:00:38.295 --> 01:00:41.731 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'd become strong like Jiraiya,
Tsunade, and Orochimaru.

01:00:45.269 --> 01:00:51.175 position:13% line:83% align:start
However, the Hokage found
out about my research

01:00:51.208 --> 01:00:55.946 position:13% line:83% align:start
and tried to eliminate me
before I could complete it.

01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:57.881 position:16% line:83% align:start
-So you were actually a
ninja of the Leaf then?

01:01:10.562 --> 01:01:11.363 position:21% line:83% align:start
-This is Hiruko's--

01:01:11.396 --> 01:01:12.530 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Come out.

01:01:12.564 --> 01:01:13.498 position:33% line:83% align:start
Quit hiding.

01:01:29.582 --> 01:01:33.386 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Kakashi, come to me now.

01:01:33.419 --> 01:01:36.756 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your kekkei genkai is
the fifth and final one.

01:01:36.788 --> 01:01:41.794 position:10% line:83% align:start
At long last, I will finally
become an immortal and perfect

01:01:41.827 --> 01:01:42.295 position:41% line:83% align:start
ninja.

01:01:50.437 --> 01:01:50.903 position:44% line:83% align:start
-No.

01:01:50.936 --> 01:01:52.238 position:38% line:83% align:start
Kakashi!

01:01:52.272 --> 01:01:55.875 position:7% line:83% align:start
-It seems the only way to stop
Kakashi is to defeat Hiruko.

01:01:55.908 --> 01:01:56.677 position:44% line:83% align:start
No.

01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:58.312 position:41% line:83% align:start
Wait!

01:01:58.345 --> 01:01:59.246 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Listen.

01:01:59.279 --> 01:02:00.914 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't use ninja
arts against him.

01:02:00.947 --> 01:02:02.316 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu.

01:02:08.455 --> 01:02:12.993 position:16% line:83% align:start
-The first, Gale Style,
Thundercloud Void Wave.

01:02:20.168 --> 01:02:23.037 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Rasengan!

01:02:23.071 --> 01:02:27.375 position:24% line:83% align:start
-The second, Shade
Style, Black Hole.

01:02:27.408 --> 01:02:29.778 position:27% line:83% align:start
The Shade Style
absorbs your chakra.

01:02:47.895 --> 01:02:50.432 position:35% line:83% align:start
The third.

01:02:50.466 --> 01:02:55.371 position:10% line:83% align:start
With this Steel Style, even
blades cannot touch me.

01:02:58.073 --> 01:03:02.846 position:16% line:83% align:start
The fourth, Quick Style.

01:03:02.878 --> 01:03:05.615 position:24% line:83% align:start
Those who rely on
brute strength alone

01:03:05.648 --> 01:03:08.217 position:7% line:83% align:start
can't keep up with this style.

01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:10.687 position:21% line:83% align:start
-He can do more than
simply absorb jutsu.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.921 position:24% line:83% align:start
He can access the
four kekkei genkai

01:03:12.955 --> 01:03:14.691 position:24% line:83% align:start
that he's already
absorbed and use them

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:16.760 position:16% line:83% align:start
as if they were his own.

01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:18.128 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Shade Style, Judgment.

01:03:25.502 --> 01:03:27.605 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's your chakra I
just returned to you.

01:03:27.638 --> 01:03:31.609 position:10% line:83% align:start
Now, stay over there and be
quiet, like good children.

01:03:31.642 --> 01:03:33.143 position:30% line:83% align:start
Come, Kakashi.

01:03:33.176 --> 01:03:35.513 position:19% line:83% align:start
Time for me to undergo
the body synthesis

01:03:35.546 --> 01:03:36.680 position:10% line:83% align:start
and become a perfect ninja.

01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:44.388 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Kakashi Sensei.

01:03:44.422 --> 01:03:45.289 position:44% line:83% align:start
No.

01:03:45.322 --> 01:03:46.323 position:33% line:83% align:start
Don't do it.

01:03:46.357 --> 01:03:48.526 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't go through that gate.

01:03:48.559 --> 01:03:51.262 position:21% line:83% align:start
-It's for the best.

01:03:51.295 --> 01:03:53.297 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's no other way
for us to defeat Hiruko.

01:04:19.324 --> 01:04:21.928 position:16% line:83% align:start
-It was your acquisition
of Obito's Sharingan

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:25.631 position:10% line:83% align:start
that gave me the key on how
to make my body perfect.

01:04:25.665 --> 01:04:28.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
Soon, the moon will
overshadow the sun

01:04:28.835 --> 01:04:30.903 position:16% line:83% align:start
to create an annularity.

01:04:30.938 --> 01:04:35.742 position:10% line:83% align:start
At that moment, the sunlight
will possess special powers.

01:04:35.776 --> 01:04:37.945 position:21% line:83% align:start
When you are bathed
in that light,

01:04:37.977 --> 01:04:41.414 position:24% line:83% align:start
you will become a
part of me, and I

01:04:41.447 --> 01:04:44.785 position:13% line:83% align:start
will become a perfect and
immortal ninja, Kakashi.

01:04:51.592 --> 01:04:53.694 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Kakashi.

01:04:53.727 --> 01:04:54.461 position:38% line:83% align:start
Dammit.

01:04:54.495 --> 01:04:56.430 position:13% line:83% align:start
-I won't let you do this.

01:04:56.463 --> 01:04:58.867 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Man, you're really persistent.

01:04:58.900 --> 01:04:59.868 position:30% line:83% align:start
Now, move it.

01:04:59.901 --> 01:05:00.534 position:44% line:83% align:start
-No.

01:05:00.567 --> 01:05:01.803 position:38% line:83% align:start
No way.

01:05:01.836 --> 01:05:04.238 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've sworn to protect the
king, the children who

01:05:04.271 --> 01:05:06.139 position:7% line:83% align:start
are the future of the village.

01:05:06.173 --> 01:05:06.875 position:27% line:83% align:start
SHIKAMARU: Yeah.

01:05:06.908 --> 01:05:09.544 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's what I'm doing.

01:05:09.577 --> 01:05:12.280 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'll protect
Kakashi's teachings,

01:05:12.313 --> 01:05:13.781 position:19% line:83% align:start
and I'll save him too.

01:05:13.815 --> 01:05:15.015 position:13% line:83% align:start
He's part of the village.

01:05:19.254 --> 01:05:20.956 position:27% line:83% align:start
We can do this.

01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:24.192 position:13% line:83% align:start
We can protect our village
and keep our friends

01:05:24.225 --> 01:05:27.362 position:16% line:83% align:start
safe, the children too.

01:05:27.395 --> 01:05:28.764 position:35% line:83% align:start
-But why?

01:05:28.797 --> 01:05:29.397 position:30% line:83% align:start
Why your way?

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:37.205 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Because what I'm protecting
is the most important thing

01:05:37.238 --> 01:05:39.441 position:7% line:83% align:start
for the future of our village.

01:05:39.475 --> 01:05:40.442 position:30% line:83% align:start
-What's that?

01:05:40.476 --> 01:05:41.810 position:21% line:83% align:start
What are you saying?

01:05:41.844 --> 01:05:44.513 position:21% line:83% align:start
-All of the children
back in the village,

01:05:44.547 --> 01:05:46.715 position:24% line:83% align:start
they need a future
they can believe in

01:05:46.749 --> 01:05:49.318 position:27% line:83% align:start
to take pride in
our way of life.

01:05:49.351 --> 01:05:52.022 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yes, our ninja protect
the code of the village,

01:05:52.054 --> 01:05:54.156 position:19% line:83% align:start
and they'll always be
willing to give their lives

01:05:54.189 --> 01:05:55.859 position:7% line:83% align:start
to keep people safe from harm.

01:05:55.892 --> 01:05:59.696 position:21% line:83% align:start
But listen, there's
more than that.

01:05:59.729 --> 01:06:02.365 position:19% line:83% align:start
Is sacrificing friends
the way of the village?

01:06:02.399 --> 01:06:04.834 position:30% line:83% align:start
Is that really
who we want to be?

01:06:04.868 --> 01:06:06.570 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are you OK with that?

01:06:06.603 --> 01:06:08.138 position:21% line:83% align:start
Winning that way may
save our village,

01:06:08.171 --> 01:06:10.340 position:13% line:83% align:start
but it'll corrupt it too.

01:06:10.373 --> 01:06:12.642 position:10% line:83% align:start
It'll only cause suffering.

01:06:12.676 --> 01:06:14.311 position:30% line:83% align:start
Don't you see?

01:06:14.344 --> 01:06:16.948 position:16% line:83% align:start
The village I love just
doesn't do things that way.

01:06:22.753 --> 01:06:27.123 position:24% line:83% align:start
I want to protect
it no matter what.

01:06:30.494 --> 01:06:32.997 position:19% line:83% align:start
We have to protect the
Leaf Village I love.

01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:34.565 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's the only
future that matters.

01:06:34.599 --> 01:06:36.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's the future
the children need.

01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:58.290 position:19% line:83% align:start
ASUMA: Shikamaru, the
king that we spoke of.

01:06:58.323 --> 01:07:01.961 position:21% line:83% align:start
The children of the
Leaf are the king.

01:07:01.995 --> 01:07:05.163 position:19% line:83% align:start
They carry the Leaf's
future on their shoulders.

01:07:05.197 --> 01:07:08.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
Please protect the future
of the Hidden Leaf Village

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:13.006 position:5% line:83% align:start
that I loved for those children.

01:07:13.039 --> 01:07:15.808 position:21% line:83% align:start
Shikamaru, you sure?

01:07:15.842 --> 01:07:18.011 position:19% line:83% align:start
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
What he wants

01:07:18.044 --> 01:07:20.346 position:19% line:83% align:start
is to protect the very
same thing as you, Asuma.

01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:24.283 position:30% line:83% align:start
-That's right.

01:07:24.317 --> 01:07:25.485 position:19% line:83% align:start
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER):
He's trying

01:07:25.518 --> 01:07:27.854 position:13% line:83% align:start
to leave behind something
important to the king,

01:07:27.888 --> 01:07:30.958 position:19% line:83% align:start
to give those children
not just a future but one

01:07:30.991 --> 01:07:32.726 position:19% line:83% align:start
they can be proud of.

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:36.930 position:27% line:83% align:start
-And that's also
the Will of Fire.

01:07:36.964 --> 01:07:37.430 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Asuma.

01:08:11.299 --> 01:08:13.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Naruto, Shadow Stitching.

01:08:28.150 --> 01:08:32.822 position:16% line:83% align:start
Naruto, the Will of Fire
has been passed to you.

01:08:32.855 --> 01:08:37.093 position:10% line:83% align:start
Follow your ninja way and go
do what you believe is right.

01:08:37.127 --> 01:08:37.593 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Shikamaru.

01:08:41.098 --> 01:08:42.032 position:38% line:83% align:start
Got it.

01:08:48.004 --> 01:08:48.939 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll handle this.

01:08:48.972 --> 01:08:50.339 position:33% line:83% align:start
Don't worry.

01:08:50.372 --> 01:08:51.307 position:19% line:83% align:start
I won't let you down.

01:08:58.315 --> 01:08:59.249 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Naruto.

01:08:59.282 --> 01:09:00.350 position:27% line:83% align:start
-It's up to you.

01:09:05.522 --> 01:09:07.892 position:7% line:83% align:start
-You really think I'd let you
get away with this, Hiruko?

01:09:12.562 --> 01:09:14.966 position:16% line:83% align:start
-So this is what Jiraiya
was talking about.

01:09:18.202 --> 01:09:21.539 position:13% line:83% align:start
The Village Hidden in the
Leaves has hung its fate

01:09:21.572 --> 01:09:23.007 position:19% line:83% align:start
on Naruto's shoulders.

01:09:29.847 --> 01:09:32.918 position:27% line:83% align:start
HIRUKO: The moon
is hiding the sun.

01:09:32.951 --> 01:09:35.520 position:16% line:83% align:start
When the eldritch light
of the full solar eclipse

01:09:35.553 --> 01:09:38.157 position:21% line:83% align:start
shines down on this
place, the requirements

01:09:38.190 --> 01:09:41.425 position:24% line:83% align:start
of Heaven, Earth,
and Man will be met.

01:09:41.459 --> 01:09:44.830 position:24% line:83% align:start
And then, Kakashi
Hatake, your Sharingan

01:09:44.863 --> 01:09:47.232 position:27% line:83% align:start
will become mine
to wield as my own.

01:09:58.343 --> 01:10:00.780 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Stop.

01:10:00.814 --> 01:10:04.117 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't you lay a
hand on any of them.

01:10:04.150 --> 01:10:07.887 position:35% line:83% align:start
[laughing]

01:10:07.921 --> 01:10:10.723 position:19% line:83% align:start
-With the power of the
light of the solar eclipse,

01:10:10.757 --> 01:10:13.860 position:10% line:83% align:start
my synthesized body will be
perfected and unstoppable.

01:10:22.802 --> 01:10:23.703 position:27% line:83% align:start
-I'll stop you.

01:10:32.213 --> 01:10:33.681 position:24% line:83% align:start
-You're too late.

01:10:33.714 --> 01:10:35.716 position:24% line:83% align:start
Kakashi has become
part of me now.

01:10:35.749 --> 01:10:37.418 position:19% line:83% align:start
He's completely mine.

01:10:42.957 --> 01:10:43.924 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Knock it off.

01:11:00.342 --> 01:11:00.842 position:41% line:83% align:start
-What?

01:11:04.913 --> 01:11:06.081 position:44% line:83% align:start
No.

01:11:06.114 --> 01:11:10.152 position:24% line:83% align:start
What are you doing
to me, Kakashi?

01:11:10.186 --> 01:11:11.254 position:44% line:83% align:start
No.

01:11:11.287 --> 01:11:13.455 position:19% line:83% align:start
I will not allow this
to happen, Kakashi.

01:11:25.601 --> 01:11:28.004 position:7% line:83% align:start
NARUTO (VOICEOVER): Kakashi's
using his Mangekyo Sharingan

01:11:28.037 --> 01:11:30.506 position:13% line:83% align:start
to pull both of them into
an alternate dimension.

01:11:30.539 --> 01:11:33.643 position:30% line:83% align:start
But if he does
that, he'll die too.

01:11:33.676 --> 01:11:37.647 position:13% line:83% align:start
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu.

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:38.148 position:35% line:83% align:start
Rasengan.

01:11:40.716 --> 01:11:41.651 position:35% line:83% align:start
Let's go.

01:11:54.197 --> 01:11:54.665 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Now what?

01:11:58.102 --> 01:11:58.635 position:30% line:83% align:start
ALL: Rasengan!

01:12:38.077 --> 01:12:39.044 position:44% line:83% align:start
-No.

01:12:39.078 --> 01:12:40.045 position:27% line:83% align:start
I won't let go.

01:12:51.291 --> 01:12:52.993 position:38% line:83% align:start
Sensei?

01:12:53.026 --> 01:12:54.461 position:38% line:83% align:start
Sensei?

01:12:54.493 --> 01:12:57.397 position:27% line:83% align:start
Come on, Sensei.

01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:59.766 position:7% line:83% align:start
Just wake up, Kakashi Sensei.

01:12:59.799 --> 01:13:01.301 position:19% line:83% align:start
Please open your eyes.

01:13:01.334 --> 01:13:02.669 position:38% line:83% align:start
Wake up.

01:13:02.702 --> 01:13:05.772 position:10% line:83% align:start
I made a promise to Sakura,
and I always keep my promises.

01:13:05.805 --> 01:13:08.409 position:5% line:83% align:start
I told her that I'd protect you
and bring you back home safe.

01:13:11.678 --> 01:13:14.148 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why does it always
turn out like this?

01:13:14.181 --> 01:13:15.316 position:44% line:83% align:start
Why?

01:13:15.349 --> 01:13:15.815 position:38% line:83% align:start
Dammit!

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:19.786 position:44% line:83% align:start
Why?

01:13:28.429 --> 01:13:29.296 position:19% line:83% align:start
KAKASHI: Good morning.

01:13:34.269 --> 01:13:35.903 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Sensei, you're alive.

01:13:35.936 --> 01:13:40.941 position:19% line:83% align:start
-What in the hell are
you doing here, Naruto?

01:13:40.976 --> 01:13:42.877 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Boy, did you ever
have me worried.

01:13:42.911 --> 01:13:45.047 position:33% line:83% align:start
Just a sec.

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:45.713 position:41% line:83% align:start
Here.

01:13:45.746 --> 01:13:47.949 position:41% line:83% align:start
Look.

01:13:47.983 --> 01:13:50.152 position:24% line:83% align:start
You said that you
wanted me to fix them.

01:13:50.185 --> 01:13:53.489 position:13% line:83% align:start
So that's just what I did.

01:13:53.523 --> 01:13:56.191 position:24% line:83% align:start
I never forgot the
lesson of these bells.

01:13:56.224 --> 01:13:58.927 position:21% line:83% align:start
So I came after you.

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:02.465 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll never forget what you
taught me, Kakashi Sensei.

01:14:02.498 --> 01:14:04.599 position:19% line:83% align:start
Those ninja who break
the rules of the village

01:14:04.633 --> 01:14:07.070 position:24% line:83% align:start
are considered to
be nothing but scum.

01:14:07.103 --> 01:14:08.438 position:27% line:83% align:start
But anybody who
would ever choose

01:14:08.471 --> 01:14:10.273 position:24% line:83% align:start
to turn their back
on their friends

01:14:10.306 --> 01:14:12.742 position:16% line:83% align:start
is even worse than scum.

01:14:12.775 --> 01:14:13.242 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Naruto.

01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:18.381 position:30% line:83% align:start
Wait a second.

01:14:18.414 --> 01:14:21.452 position:13% line:83% align:start
If I'm still around, then
that means the whole plan

01:14:21.485 --> 01:14:22.151 position:24% line:83% align:start
failed, didn't it.

01:14:25.655 --> 01:14:26.589 position:33% line:83% align:start
HIRUKO: Yes.

01:14:26.622 --> 01:14:27.824 position:10% line:83% align:start
And thanks for that, Naruto.

01:14:36.632 --> 01:14:39.069 position:24% line:83% align:start
Kakashi's trap was
quite ingenious.

01:14:39.103 --> 01:14:41.839 position:13% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't have been able
to escape from it otherwise.

01:14:41.872 --> 01:14:45.676 position:7% line:83% align:start
But ironically, in the end, it
was Kakashi's very own student

01:14:45.709 --> 01:14:46.610 position:30% line:83% align:start
who saved me.

01:14:51.148 --> 01:14:53.650 position:24% line:83% align:start
The solar eclipse
isn't over yet.

01:14:53.684 --> 01:14:56.988 position:7% line:83% align:start
And I've already fulfilled the
Earth and Heaven requirements.

01:14:57.021 --> 01:14:59.224 position:30% line:83% align:start
So I can still
kill you, Kakashi,

01:14:59.257 --> 01:15:03.261 position:5% line:83% align:start
fulfill the requirement for Man,
and take your kekkei genkai.

01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:10.068 position:35% line:83% align:start
-What now?

01:15:10.101 --> 01:15:11.069 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Run, Naruto.

01:15:11.102 --> 01:15:11.570 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Right.

01:15:35.094 --> 01:15:36.363 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Did Naruto do it?

01:15:36.396 --> 01:15:37.096 position:27% line:83% align:start
Did he stop him?

01:15:44.137 --> 01:15:47.340 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Not so fast, Kakashi,
my old friend.

01:15:47.374 --> 01:15:50.043 position:30% line:83% align:start
Now, you will
become a part of me.

01:15:50.076 --> 01:15:50.877 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's no escape.

01:15:53.547 --> 01:15:56.249 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Well, what are you
guys waiting for?

01:15:56.283 --> 01:15:57.784 position:13% line:83% align:start
I wanted to save Kakashi.

01:15:57.817 --> 01:16:00.887 position:10% line:83% align:start
But I'm not the only one who
inherited the Will of Fire.

01:16:00.921 --> 01:16:02.722 position:5% line:83% align:start
All of us from the Leaf have it.

01:16:02.756 --> 01:16:04.024 position:27% line:83% align:start
So let's use it.

01:16:08.663 --> 01:16:09.397 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.

01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:12.732 position:13% line:83% align:start
He's just one guy, right?

01:16:12.766 --> 01:16:15.670 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Let's do it.

01:16:15.702 --> 01:16:19.473 position:10% line:83% align:start
-I guess we have no choice.

01:16:19.507 --> 01:16:24.446 position:10% line:83% align:start
-You really don't know when
to give up, do you fools?

01:16:24.479 --> 01:16:27.248 position:16% line:83% align:start
You can't even touch me.

01:16:27.281 --> 01:16:27.748 position:35% line:83% align:start
Summoning.

01:16:39.827 --> 01:16:40.796 position:41% line:83% align:start
-What?

01:16:40.829 --> 01:16:42.264 position:33% line:83% align:start
-It's gone.

01:16:42.297 --> 01:16:43.832 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Looks like it's
been summoned away.

01:16:53.610 --> 01:16:56.613 position:16% line:83% align:start
-I really didn't want to
have to face that one again.

01:16:56.646 --> 01:16:58.181 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Leave it to me.

01:16:58.214 --> 01:17:00.849 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Come to think of it, the
book that Kakashi gave me did

01:17:00.882 --> 01:17:03.319 position:7% line:83% align:start
say that a woman could become
infinitely strong in order

01:17:03.353 --> 01:17:05.121 position:24% line:83% align:start
to protect the man
that she loves.

01:17:05.154 --> 01:17:05.989 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Shut up!

01:17:06.022 --> 01:17:07.156 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Get that beast.

01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:08.524 position:35% line:83% align:start
All right.

01:17:08.558 --> 01:17:10.927 position:16% line:83% align:start
-You know if you'd just
left well enough alone

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:14.030 position:16% line:83% align:start
all this would have been
settled in exchange for my life.

01:17:14.063 --> 01:17:14.531 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.

01:17:14.565 --> 01:17:15.231 position:41% line:83% align:start
Yeah.

01:17:15.265 --> 01:17:17.635 position:19% line:83% align:start
Complain all you want.

01:17:17.668 --> 01:17:19.869 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you didn't want me
to learn this lesson,

01:17:19.902 --> 01:17:21.472 position:27% line:83% align:start
you never should
have taught it to me.

01:17:29.013 --> 01:17:31.115 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Let's get him, Naruto.

01:17:31.148 --> 01:17:31.715 position:35% line:83% align:start
All right.

01:17:47.064 --> 01:17:50.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
-I hope there's enough
light to pull this off.

01:17:50.035 --> 01:17:50.901 position:24% line:83% align:start
Shadow Stitching.

01:17:53.605 --> 01:17:55.607 position:38% line:83% align:start
Go now!

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.809 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Ninja Art Super Beast Scroll.

01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:03.181 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Cherry Blossom Thrust.

01:18:13.958 --> 01:18:15.461 position:21% line:83% align:start
-You're all so weak.

01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:28.709 position:24% line:83% align:start
Give up, Kakashi.

01:18:28.742 --> 01:18:31.378 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sooner or later,
I will absorb you.

01:18:31.411 --> 01:18:33.547 position:16% line:83% align:start
Gale Style, Gale Dragon.

01:18:44.458 --> 01:18:45.325 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Be careful.

01:18:45.359 --> 01:18:47.762 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's no ordinary storm cloud.

01:18:47.795 --> 01:18:50.631 position:7% line:83% align:start
HIRUKO: It's a cumular nimbus
that expands infinitely

01:18:50.665 --> 01:18:52.265 position:13% line:83% align:start
as I fill it with chakra.

01:18:52.299 --> 01:18:54.901 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll use that energy to
scour this whole area.

01:18:54.935 --> 01:18:57.372 position:10% line:83% align:start
SHIKAMARU (VOICEOVER): This
guy was born from the Chimera

01:18:57.405 --> 01:19:00.308 position:19% line:83% align:start
Jutsu, a monster with
four kekkei genkai.

01:19:00.341 --> 01:19:02.777 position:16% line:83% align:start
But until he absorbs the
fifth from Kakashi Sensei,

01:19:02.810 --> 01:19:06.180 position:19% line:83% align:start
his body is incomplete
and vulnerable.

01:19:09.717 --> 01:19:11.085 position:27% line:83% align:start
Listen, Naruto.

01:19:11.119 --> 01:19:14.255 position:5% line:83% align:start
The place where he put the last
kekkei genkai is still empty.

01:19:14.288 --> 01:19:17.158 position:13% line:83% align:start
Right now, his biggest and
maybe his only weakness

01:19:17.191 --> 01:19:18.660 position:13% line:83% align:start
is that void on his chest.

01:19:24.031 --> 01:19:24.999 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Got it.

01:19:31.373 --> 01:19:31.874 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Shoot.

01:19:46.188 --> 01:19:48.157 position:35% line:83% align:start
-You guys.

01:19:48.190 --> 01:19:50.860 position:30% line:83% align:start
-You all came.

01:19:50.894 --> 01:19:52.529 position:19% line:83% align:start
-All right, everyone.

01:19:52.562 --> 01:19:56.399 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's show this guy what we got.

01:19:56.433 --> 01:19:58.301 position:19% line:83% align:start
Super Expansion Jutsu.

01:20:02.038 --> 01:20:06.009 position:19% line:83% align:start
Spiking Human Boulder.

01:20:06.042 --> 01:20:07.510 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Fang Over Fang.

01:20:12.115 --> 01:20:15.686 position:21% line:83% align:start
BOTH: Eight Trigrams
Sixty-Four Palms.

01:20:15.719 --> 01:20:16.654 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Leaf Hurricane.

01:20:20.658 --> 01:20:23.093 position:33% line:83% align:start
Now, Tenten.

01:20:23.127 --> 01:20:24.094 position:38% line:83% align:start
-On it.

01:20:24.128 --> 01:20:25.563 position:19% line:83% align:start
Rising Dragon Control.

01:20:28.566 --> 01:20:29.033 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Naruto.

01:20:34.004 --> 01:20:34.972 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Let's do this.

01:20:38.976 --> 01:20:40.912 position:13% line:83% align:start
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu.

01:20:44.416 --> 01:20:48.153 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Ninjutsu will not
work against me.

01:20:48.186 --> 01:20:49.654 position:21% line:83% align:start
ALL: Giant Rasengan.

01:21:08.608 --> 01:21:09.575 position:21% line:83% align:start
HIRUKO: Don't worry.

01:21:09.609 --> 01:21:11.644 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll return all
this chakra to you.

01:21:25.024 --> 01:21:25.859 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Lightening Blade.

01:21:29.897 --> 01:21:32.031 position:16% line:83% align:start
-I knew that was coming.

01:21:32.064 --> 01:21:32.533 position:41% line:83% align:start
-What?

01:21:35.636 --> 01:21:37.571 position:16% line:83% align:start
-And here it comes back.

01:21:37.604 --> 01:21:38.438 position:27% line:83% align:start
Lightning Blade!

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:48.415 position:38% line:83% align:start
-No way.

01:21:48.448 --> 01:21:50.952 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're not going to win.

01:21:50.985 --> 01:21:52.020 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're all fools.

01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:10.271 position:30% line:83% align:start
-It's no use.

01:22:35.464 --> 01:22:37.767 position:5% line:83% align:start
-So you have another jutsu, huh?

01:22:37.801 --> 01:22:42.005 position:7% line:83% align:start
But like I told you, ninjutsu
is powerless against me.

01:22:47.978 --> 01:22:48.945 position:33% line:83% align:start
What's this?

01:22:48.979 --> 01:22:50.947 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can't absorb it.

01:22:50.981 --> 01:22:52.950 position:33% line:83% align:start
It can't be.

01:22:52.984 --> 01:22:53.985 position:30% line:83% align:start
Such a jutsu.

01:22:54.018 --> 01:22:54.651 position:44% line:83% align:start
No.

01:22:54.684 --> 01:22:56.720 position:21% line:83% align:start
I won't believe it.

01:22:56.753 --> 01:22:58.288 position:21% line:83% align:start
-You don't have to.

01:22:58.321 --> 01:23:00.791 position:13% line:83% align:start
Wind Style Rasen Shuriken.

01:23:29.755 --> 01:23:30.187 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Hai.

01:24:02.689 --> 01:24:03.856 position:33% line:83% align:start
-That's it.

01:24:03.890 --> 01:24:04.357 position:35% line:83% align:start
We did it.

01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:20.070 position:24% line:83% align:start
-By now, I should
have absorbed you

01:25:20.103 --> 01:25:22.938 position:10% line:83% align:start
and achieved a perfect body.

01:25:22.973 --> 01:25:25.942 position:21% line:83% align:start
What did I do wrong?

01:25:25.976 --> 01:25:29.311 position:13% line:83% align:start
-To conquer your weakness
you isolated yourself.

01:25:29.345 --> 01:25:31.081 position:30% line:83% align:start
You withdrew.

01:25:31.114 --> 01:25:34.383 position:5% line:83% align:start
All alone you sought perfection.

01:25:34.416 --> 01:25:37.286 position:19% line:83% align:start
That was your mistake.

01:25:37.319 --> 01:25:39.756 position:21% line:83% align:start
-That's the kind of
things that only someone

01:25:39.790 --> 01:25:42.926 position:27% line:83% align:start
who's been born
strong would say.

01:25:42.959 --> 01:25:47.265 position:10% line:83% align:start
I never had friends to rely
on even when I first started.

01:25:47.297 --> 01:25:50.300 position:5% line:83% align:start
I had no choice but to be alone.

01:25:50.333 --> 01:25:51.668 position:27% line:83% align:start
TSUNADE: That's
not true, Hiruko.

01:26:00.011 --> 01:26:01.913 position:24% line:83% align:start
I was right there.

01:26:01.946 --> 01:26:03.313 position:7% line:83% align:start
JIRAIYA: Yeah, and I was too.

01:26:06.184 --> 01:26:08.187 position:27% line:83% align:start
HIRUZEN: Hiruko,
just open your eyes.

01:26:11.022 --> 01:26:13.825 position:16% line:83% align:start
-You should have bonded
with your friends

01:26:13.858 --> 01:26:16.394 position:5% line:83% align:start
instead of choosing loneliness.

01:26:16.427 --> 01:26:18.063 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you had done that,
then your friends

01:26:18.096 --> 01:26:22.000 position:16% line:83% align:start
would have been able to
save you from this fate.

01:26:22.034 --> 01:26:26.004 position:5% line:83% align:start
-My friends would have-- I see.

01:26:26.038 --> 01:26:28.941 position:24% line:83% align:start
You almost did it
too, didn't you?

01:26:28.974 --> 01:26:32.444 position:21% line:83% align:start
You almost made the
exact same mistake as I.

01:26:32.477 --> 01:26:33.712 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yes.

01:26:33.745 --> 01:26:37.482 position:10% line:83% align:start
I almost did, just like you.

01:26:37.516 --> 01:26:39.351 position:10% line:83% align:start
Maybe it's not you who lost.

01:26:39.384 --> 01:26:43.156 position:13% line:83% align:start
It was me, or both of us.

01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:48.962 position:16% line:83% align:start
If I'd sacrificed myself
and saved the Leaf Village,

01:26:48.995 --> 01:26:53.132 position:5% line:83% align:start
I would have cut off my friends.

01:26:53.166 --> 01:26:56.069 position:13% line:83% align:start
I was trying to sacrifice
the most important thing

01:26:56.102 --> 01:26:58.205 position:27% line:83% align:start
in the village.

01:26:58.239 --> 01:27:01.108 position:10% line:83% align:start
I just forgot what matters.

01:27:07.747 --> 01:27:17.157 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Do you think I could have also
had a bond with my friends?

01:27:42.417 --> 01:27:45.854 position:21% line:83% align:start
[chatter and cheers]

01:27:48.523 --> 01:27:50.425 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah!

01:27:50.458 --> 01:27:52.827 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Hooray!

01:27:52.861 --> 01:27:53.329 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Naruto!

01:27:58.134 --> 01:27:59.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
KAKASHI (VOICEOVER):
Even as young

01:27:59.567 --> 01:28:04.206 position:13% line:83% align:start
as you are, you've already
far surpassed me, Naruto.

01:28:21.391 --> 01:28:24.361 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Gaara.

01:28:24.394 --> 01:28:25.696 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Withdraw.

01:28:25.729 --> 01:28:27.864 position:5% line:83% align:start
The situation has been resolved.

01:28:27.898 --> 01:28:29.299 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Sir.

01:28:29.333 --> 01:28:30.634 position:35% line:83% align:start
Withdraw!

01:28:30.667 --> 01:28:31.335 position:35% line:83% align:start
Withdraw!

01:28:31.368 --> 01:28:31.835 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Yes, sir.

01:28:38.608 --> 01:28:40.944 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Well, Jiraiya, I'm sorry.

01:28:40.978 --> 01:28:43.147 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Why?

01:28:43.181 --> 01:28:47.352 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Once again, I relied
on you to save me.

01:28:47.385 --> 01:28:49.988 position:30% line:83% align:start
-You're wrong.

01:28:50.021 --> 01:28:52.957 position:27% line:83% align:start
Both of us were
saved, not just you.

01:28:52.991 --> 01:28:55.560 position:24% line:83% align:start
You know, Tsunade,
I believe Naruto

01:28:55.593 --> 01:28:58.496 position:16% line:83% align:start
might be able to reach a
place I couldn't even imagine

01:28:58.529 --> 01:29:00.198 position:10% line:83% align:start
existed when I was his age.

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:04.203 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.

01:29:04.236 --> 01:29:06.804 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, he sure makes me feel old.

01:29:19.284 --> 01:29:20.819 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Kakashi Sensei.

01:29:20.853 --> 01:29:22.287 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hm.

01:29:22.321 --> 01:29:24.256 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Look.

01:29:24.289 --> 01:29:27.126 position:10% line:83% align:start
I have always tried to live
up to what you taught us back

01:29:27.159 --> 01:29:27.626 position:41% line:83% align:start
then.

01:29:33.532 --> 01:29:34.800 position:30% line:83% align:start
-You're right.

01:29:34.833 --> 01:29:37.470 position:13% line:83% align:start
In the ninja world, those
who break the rules and laws

01:29:37.504 --> 01:29:42.776 position:27% line:83% align:start
are regarded as
scum, but those who

01:29:42.809 --> 01:29:46.846 position:7% line:83% align:start
would abandon even one friend
are far worse than scum.

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:48.882 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm scum anyway.

01:29:48.915 --> 01:29:51.217 position:19% line:83% align:start
So I'm going to chose
to break the rules.

01:29:51.252 --> 01:29:52.152 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Obito.

01:29:52.185 --> 01:29:53.521 position:21% line:83% align:start
OBITO: If doing that
somehow makes me

01:29:53.553 --> 01:29:56.057 position:30% line:83% align:start
less of a true
shinobi, then I'll

01:29:56.090 --> 01:29:58.625 position:16% line:83% align:start
just go and crush all of
the so-called real shinobi.

01:30:20.915 --> 01:30:24.419 position:24% line:83% align:start
-You know, you're
a lot like him.

01:30:24.453 --> 01:30:25.686 position:30% line:83% align:start
-What's that?

01:30:25.719 --> 01:30:27.189 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why are you grinning like that?

01:30:27.222 --> 01:30:29.257 position:7% line:83% align:start
You're really weirding me out.

01:30:29.291 --> 01:30:30.392 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?

01:30:30.425 --> 01:30:32.027 position:21% line:83% align:start
HINATA: I'm shocked.

01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:34.296 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?

01:30:34.329 --> 01:30:35.630 position:41% line:83% align:start
What?

01:30:35.664 --> 01:30:38.967 position:10% line:83% align:start
-I knew the two of you have
always been close but still.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.436 position:41% line:83% align:start
[sigh]

01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:43.539 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Sometimes, after sharing
a very intense situation,

01:30:43.573 --> 01:30:46.275 position:7% line:83% align:start
it says here love can blossom.

01:30:46.309 --> 01:30:48.277 position:7% line:83% align:start
But it says nothing about men.

01:30:48.311 --> 01:30:49.178 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Oh, come on.

01:30:49.212 --> 01:30:50.745 position:13% line:83% align:start
You've got to be kidding.

01:30:50.779 --> 01:30:51.746 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh.

01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:52.448 position:44% line:83% align:start
No.

01:30:52.482 --> 01:30:53.816 position:16% line:83% align:start
That isn't what I meant.

01:30:53.850 --> 01:30:57.053 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Guy Sensei told me that is
simply another part of youth.

01:30:57.086 --> 01:30:59.523 position:7% line:83% align:start
-I always suspected something
like that was going on.

01:30:59.556 --> 01:31:05.628 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Wha-- Oh, come on.

01:31:05.661 --> 01:31:07.498 position:19% line:83% align:start
Give me a break here.

01:31:07.531 --> 01:31:08.398 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Naruto, wait.

01:31:08.432 --> 01:31:09.765 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's just a misunderstanding.

01:31:09.799 --> 01:31:10.833 position:35% line:83% align:start
Come back.

01:31:10.867 --> 01:31:11.667 position:44% line:83% align:start
-No!

01:31:11.701 --> 01:31:12.935 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Naruto, please.

01:31:12.969 --> 01:31:15.606 position:44% line:83% align:start
-No!

01:31:15.638 --> 01:31:15.705 position:30% line:83% align:start
