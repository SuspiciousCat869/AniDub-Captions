1
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:40,583
The train to New Ikebukuro is
now arriving on Platform One.

2
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:42,500
Please watch your
step when boarding

3
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,958
and stand clear of
closing doors.

4
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,875
The Tokyo Metro
New Marunouchi line

5
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,458
would like to thank you
for riding with us today.

6
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,250
This train is currently
bound for New Ikebukuro.

7
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,625
We'd like to take a moment
to inform all passengers

8
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:31,250
that Tokyo Metro is cooperating
fully with the nine pm curfew

9
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,125
required by the
Tokyo Government's

10
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,625
Youth Protection Act.

11
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:38,416
This curfew applies to all
citizens under twenty years old.

12
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,125
Minors may circulate
after the curfew provided

13
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:44,500
they have an approved permit
or constant adult supervision.

14
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,458
If you are without
the proper permit,

15
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,458
please proceed to the nearest
staff member for assistance.

16
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:52,083
Again, minors may
only circulate after nine

17
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:55,000
with an approved permit
or adult supervision.

18
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,250
If you need assistance,

19
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,875
please proceed to the
nearest staff member.

20
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:24,000
Shall I eat you now
or play with you first?

21
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:33,583
The train to New Ikebukuro
is arriving on Platform One.

22
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,791
Please wait behind
the white line

23
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,833
until the train comes
to a complete stop.

24
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:12,916
Go figure.

25
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,958
They're not so subtle this time.

26
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,041
Ready to head out?

27
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,375
Not yet. Gimmie a sec.

28
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:20,666
He's not there.

29
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,750
He ran off.

30
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:22,791
What?

31
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:23,833
Another group.

32
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,291
They saw him somewhere else.

33
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,666
Let's go, then.

34
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:56,750
Hello?

35
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,500
Who are you?

36
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,541
Destruction of target confirmed.

37
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,083
Two witnesses.

38
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,458
Recovery team, you're up.

39
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,291
It's dead!

40
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,041
It's totally been killed!

41
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,791
Hey.

42
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,500
Who the hell are you?

43
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,875
Fujimura?

44
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,750
Mana?

45
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:18,791
Whoa.

46
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,333
Are you okay?

47
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,583
So that's it.

48
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,291
That's an Elder Bairn?

49
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,666
Elder Bairn.

50
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,000
What are you doing out here?

51
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,750
Matsuo. Hi.

52
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,000
Fuji, we gotta roll!

53
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:34,916
Right!

54
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,333
I got ya.

55
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:49,791
Not good!

56
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,250
Hurry!

57
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,041
Move it.

58
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:07,625
Who is she?

59
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:08,416
I don't know.

60
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,833
We should go.

61
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,250
Damn it!

62
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,083
Witnesses are fleeing by car.

63
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,208
In pursuit, now.

64
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,291
Ground squads, make your move.

65
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:40,291
Hurry!

66
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,416
They're right there!

67
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,208
Then tell me where
the hell I need to go!

68
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,500
Come in, Sirrut!

69
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,666
It's Fujimura!

70
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,666
Come in!

71
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,291
There's a Tower
copter chasing us!

72
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,041
Please!

73
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:55,875
Help us!

74
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,416
Yanagi!!

75
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Fujimura.

76
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,000
You need to calm down...

77
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,750
Yeah. Okay.

78
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,041
Stand by.

79
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,041
I'll have your route
for you in just a minute.

80
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,916
Try to go ahead and
transfer any information

81
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,375
you've already gathered
in the meantime, all right?

82
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:11,041
'Kay.

83
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,166
I'll do what I can.

84
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,750
Tsuki.

85
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,416
You think you can get into the
transportation system networks?

86
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,000
Yep.

87
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:21,083
Wonderful, and what about the
Department of Motor Vehicles?

88
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,708
I can do that.

89
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,208
Mister Mogari.

90
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,958
Do you approve?

91
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:32,875
Yes.

92
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:58,541
Right there!

93
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,041
Turn right!

94
00:11:59,125 --> 00:11:59,958
Turn right!

95
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:00,875
I can't!

96
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,333
It's a one way street!

97
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,166
Oh, sorry.

98
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,916
Okay, awesome.

99
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,750
It looks like they've
finally got a route for us.

100
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:10,875
We're good to go!

101
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,708
Turn right up here.

102
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:13,541
Yeah, right there!

103
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:14,750
Right at the light

104
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:26,416
Where are you going?

105
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,041
Shut, up!

106
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,708
So, I think we
might be off route.

107
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,000
Yeah, I didn't have
much of a choice!

108
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,208
Gimmie a sec.

109
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,500
Look, you guys!

110
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:45,541
What the hell?

111
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,166
They're behind us again!

112
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,791
I need something!

113
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,791
Yanagi, help!

114
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,416
Keep going straight ahead.

115
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,291
Whatever you do,
don't slow down!

116
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,333
Hurry!

117
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,416
Okay, don't
blame me if we crash!

118
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,250
You got 'em?

119
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,541
Yep.

120
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,666
They should be good to go now.

121
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,708
I'm guessing we
should keep running.

122
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,041
For the blood.

123
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,916
I'm fine, thank you.

124
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,666
Is that man dead?

125
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,833
The important thing
is we're all safe now.

126
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,625
My poor car has had
the crap beat out of it.

127
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,541
I'm so sorry, baby girl.

128
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,583
'Twas a noble sacrifice.

129
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,958
I'm Mana Hiiragi.

130
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,041
So, um.

131
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:30,916
What's your name?

132
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,125
What?

133
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,583
I thought this girl
was a friend of yours.

134
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,166
No.

135
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,625
But she... she saved me.

136
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,500
From that thing.

137
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,708
Seriously?

138
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:44,583
She saved you?

139
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,083
From the Tower's Elder Bairn?

140
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,166
Tell me.

141
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,125
What do you know
about the Elder Bairns?

142
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,208
I know nothing.

143
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,416
What's your problem lady?

144
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,541
Let him go!

145
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,708
No.

146
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:56,791
So this Tower.

147
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,500
Where is it?

148
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,916
What do you know?

149
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,125
I don't know anything.

150
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,833
I wish I could tell you.

151
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,458
That's what we've
been trying to find out!

152
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,791
He's telling the truth.

153
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,708
Our goal is to find out
what the Tower is up to.

154
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,750
Guess you've got
something against them?

155
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,916
You mind telling
us what that is?

156
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,333
And, while you're at it.

157
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,708
What happened
back there, anyway?

158
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,583
How the hell did that thing die?

159
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,791
It died because I killed it.

160
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,708
Oh-kay.

161
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,541
What was your name again?

162
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,416
It's HQ.

163
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,333
Maybe it's Yanagi.

164
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,000
Hello, Saya Kisaragi.

165
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,666
Fumito Nanahara.

166
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,000
You want him dead, right?

167
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,666
Fumito?

168
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,166
I'd be happy to meet with you.

169
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,208
Perhaps you and
I can discuss the matter.

170
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,916
There's a reward for the victor.

171
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,333
And a punishment for the loser.

172
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,291
Excuse me, sir.

173
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,791
The Governor's office is
requesting a meeting with you.

174
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,458
They'd like to discuss the
measures they're prepared

175
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,958
to take against last month's
Youth Protection Act Violators.

176
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,250
Things will be so much easier
when you become governor.

177
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,958
Then, I won't have
to waste my time

178
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,541
on these ridiculous meetings.

179
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,083
Don't you agree, Yuka?

180
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,291
Yes, sir, one hundred percent.

181
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,833
How old are you again?

182
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,250
I'll be twenty-eight this year.

183
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,666
Isn't it amusing how you
were a high school girl

184
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,958
up until only six months ago?

185
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,291
Although, I'm sure
you'd rather forget

186
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,166
about that particular
unpleasantness.

187
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,833
Indeed, I would.

188
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,875
Thank you for understanding.

189
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:33,166
Also, about your meeting with
the US Ambassador later today.

190
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,250
They're requesting
to see you earlier.

191
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,250
It seems like that
happens a lot these days.

192
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,166
Everyone wants to change things.

193
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,250
If you ask me, given the
influence of our corporation,

194
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:47,000
Seventh Heaven, as well as
the secret you and your clan

195
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:50,125
have been keeping in
order to maintain peace.

196
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,333
You deserve far more than
you've been getting, sir.

197
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,416
You're so ambitious.

198
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,958
Mister Nanahara?

199
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,708
Yes, what is it, Kuto?

200
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,000
I have an update on our lab
escapee.

201
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,666
It's been terminated, sir.

202
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,583
The subway cleanup
is complete, as well.

203
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:13,041
But unfortunately, there were
two witnesses to the death.

204
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,416
Don't tell me they escaped.

205
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,291
I've already dealt with the men
who allowed them to get away.

206
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,541
Next time, I'll be
sure to go myself.

207
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,208
I don't know.

208
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,375
You may not be up to it.

209
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,708
Saya is here now.

210
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,458
If you're finished, shall we go?

211
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,458
What's wrong?

212
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,375
Follow me, please.

213
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,666
Come in.

214
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,208
Mana, I understand; thank you.

215
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,875
No, thank you.

216
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,416
Welcome, Saya Kisaragi.

217
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,250
I'm Kuroto Mogari.

218
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,208
Are you?

219
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,083
How do you know my name?

220
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,916
Ukishima.

221
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,625
An experiment
was performed there.

222
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,416
During which, everyone
was reportedly killed.

223
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,083
Have you heard of it?

224
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,375
Judging from the pictures,

225
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,583
it was a violent
and brutal massacre.

226
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,166
However.

227
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,833
One person was fortunate
enough to survive the ordeal.

228
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:15,750
That person was
you, Saya Kisaragi.

229
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,291
Clearly.

230
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,458
And how exactly did
you find this out?

231
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,250
Itsuki sent it to me.

232
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:30,250
You knew him by the name,
Itsuki Tomafusa, correct?

233
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,083
He hacked the Tower's cameras

234
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,791
and managed to get a
few images out to us.

235
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:38,125
Without him, we wouldn't
have known the truth.

236
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,166
Was he a part of Sirrut?

237
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,875
He never worked with the core
of this team, directly; no.

238
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,750
But technically,
he was a member.

239
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,541
What happened to him?

240
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,250
He died.

241
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,250
I knew it.

242
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,333
He was a participant in
the Ukishima experiment.

243
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,875
His goal was to try
and expose The Tower.

244
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,625
Tower?

245
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,375
The name of the
actual organization

246
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:04,125
led by Fumito Nanahara.

247
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,083
On the surface,
he's something else.

248
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,708
CEO of a company
known as Seventh Heaven.

249
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,916
It's an impressive,
massive corporation

250
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,083
and has significant
global presence.

251
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,333
Not surprisingly,

252
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:20,125
he has many connections
politically, as well.

253
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:22,541
It's widely accepted that
he was directly involved

254
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,791
with the new
Youth Protection Act.

255
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:29,166
In reality, his public persona
is just smoke and mirrors,

256
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,291
a redirection of attention.

257
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:34,000
Away from the Tower?

258
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:35,458
That's correct.

259
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:37,375
Fumito has been
using Seventh Heaven

260
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:41,333
and the Tower to achieve
a very specific objective.

261
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:42,541
And that would be?

262
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:45,416
I wish I knew,
but unfortunately,

263
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,583
we aren't entirely certain.

264
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,000
But, what we do know
is that numerous people

265
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:52,500
are being killed to fulfill it.

266
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:55,375
Hundreds, maybe more.

267
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,375
We've learned creatures
called Elder Bairns

268
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:59,625
are somehow a part
of this thing, too.

269
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:02,625
And, how do you know
all this information?

270
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:03,541
Simple.

271
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:04,791
I did research.

272
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:08,791
Using all my resources:
time, money and power.

273
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:09,958
But why?

274
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:13,166
Because Fumito
Nanahara is pure evil.

275
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,625
He took my freedom from me,
and for that he must pay.

276
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,708
That's not all.

277
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:26,833
Itsuki was only able to send us
images very sporadically,

278
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:30,250
so I saw but a fraction of
what occurred at Ukishima.

279
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:31,583
That was enough, though.

280
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:33,208
And then, there was you.

281
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:34,708
Funny.

282
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,958
You seem quite different,
from all the pictures, I mean.

283
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:41,416
Almost like Fumito was trying to
manipulate you for some reason.

284
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,833
Now you're here.

285
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:46,291
I'm assuming to find him
and punish him for his crimes.

286
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:47,791
It's taken you six months,

287
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:50,041
but you've finally
made your way to us.

288
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,375
Although you've attracted

289
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:53,500
a fair amount of attention
wherever you've gone.

290
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:56,333
Not that any of your
actions were reported.

291
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,250
Then how did you know?

292
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,458
It's not that
difficult, actually.

293
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:04,125
Internet restrictions might
be severe, especially in Tokyo.

294
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:06,041
But we have a couple
of talented hackers

295
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:08,333
that help us find
useful information.

296
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:14,583
This is one.

297
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,291
Hiro Tsukiyama.

298
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,708
We call her Tsuki.

299
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:22,541
And me.

300
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:23,875
The other hacker is me!

301
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:24,916
True.

302
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,541
Though your
talent is in question.

303
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:29,166
Meet Fuji, Shun Fujimura.

304
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:33,500
And the big one, our resident
driver, is Iori Matsuo.

305
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:34,708
Hey.

306
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:37,291
I imagine Mana already
introduced herself?

307
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:42,666
My name is Haruno Yanagi.

308
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,250
I'm Mogari's assistant.

309
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:46,625
And together, we make up
the entirety of Sirrut

310
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:48,166
working from this mansion.

311
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,083
Welcome, Saya.

312
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:52,208
Although, there
are other members.

313
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,708
They're located
all over the world

314
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:56,791
and help us out online;
we've got a lot of support.

315
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:58,125
That's right!

316
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:00,291
Our goal is to overturn
the Youth Protection Act.

317
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,083
Not to mention the
stupid web restrictions

318
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:04,041
and all those lame new laws.

319
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:06,083
We're taking down the man!

320
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:10,416
Fumito. Tell me.
Where is he?

321
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,916
Yes, where is Fumito?

322
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,833
That's a very good question.

323
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:16,833
These days he rarely makes
any public appearances.

324
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:19,291
And his location is kept secret.

325
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:23,083
Meaning you don't
know where he is.

326
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:27,041
Oh, I have a way to find him.

327
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,666
Just take a look around you.

328
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,125
These people along

329
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:32,291
with other Sirrut members
out there will provide help.

330
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:33,750
They are willing
and able to give you all

331
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:36,375
of the information
you need on him.

332
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:41,083
In return, we request your
assistance, Saya Kisaragi.

333
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:57,041
Fumito Nanahara
is my only concern.

334
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:04,958
Do not forget that.

335
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,750
Guys!

336
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:19,333
Think this chick
should be joining us?

337
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:20,708
Hey?!

338
00:26:20,791 --> 00:26:22,166
Thanks, Fuji.

339
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,708
Here you go, Tsuki.

340
00:26:25,791 --> 00:26:26,875
Thank you.

341
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:28,958
Why are you asking, Matsuo?

342
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:31,291
Don't tell me you're not
wondering the same thing!

343
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:32,666
Unless, I mean,
you have a good reason

344
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,083
to trust her that you
haven't shared with us yet.

345
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:36,291
I don't like her.

346
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:39,083
She's quiet and
really freakin' pretentious.

347
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:41,833
Come on; she sure
is pretty, isn't she?!

348
00:26:42,916 --> 00:26:45,416
That girl almost ripped your
face off with her bare hands.

349
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,125
But being pretty is
all that matters to you?

350
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:48,625
Uncle!

351
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:49,541
Uncle!

352
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:52,333
It's Mister Mogari's decision.

353
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:55,291
Yeah, I'm not stupid;
I know that.

354
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:58,125
But just for the record,
I don't like it.

355
00:26:58,208 --> 00:26:59,625
I don't like it at all.

356
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:01,125
Tsuki agrees with me!

357
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:02,375
Isn't that right?

358
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:05,500
No, I know what
Tsuki doesn't like.

359
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,708
Mana finally made her
way back to our group.

360
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:09,250
But now, thanks
to our friend Saya.

361
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:12,666
she's way too busy with
someone else to play with her.

362
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,166
For that.

363
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,666
I'm not gonna show you the
new kitten video I downloaded.

364
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,625
No, show it to me!

365
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:19,625
 Don't listen to him!

366
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:20,541
Take away his kittens!

367
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:21,250
Shut up!

368
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:22,291
That's not fair!

369
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:24,583
Please let me see them!

370
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:34,125
Amazing place, isn't it?

371
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:37,375
You know, Mister Mogari is
also the president of Cisnet.

372
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:38,791
That's a company
most kids right

373
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:41,458
out of school dream
of working for.

374
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,750
So, Saya.

375
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:48,541
That's a really pretty name.

376
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:54,125
Oh, um, I think Kisaragi sounds
like a cool last name, too.

377
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:56,583
That is not my last name.

378
00:27:58,583 --> 00:28:00,125
It's not?

379
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,833
Oh, wait, stop!

380
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,791
Your room is right here.

381
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,791
The bathroom's um, over there.

382
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:13,208
Do you need clothes?

383
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,958
This is fine.

384
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,541
But you need to
wash off all the--

385
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:20,625
I can just have Haruno find you
a change of clothes; it's okay.

386
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:22,958
I said this is fine.

387
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:24,083
All right.

388
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:25,250
Just so you know,

389
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:26,625
everyone else kind
of goes back and forth

390
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:28,041
between here and their homes.

391
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:29,416
But Mister Mogari
has been kind enough

392
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,208
to let me live here permanently.

393
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:33,375
My room is right
next door, so uh.

394
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:36,875
If... If you need anything,
just let me know.

395
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:39,833
That's all. Ohh...

396
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:41,416
Good night!

397
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:45,291
Well, if you have
like a problem

398
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:47,625
or there's anything
else you need.

399
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:50,291
You can, um, just.

400
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:52,791
Well, I guess just let me know.

401
00:28:54,958 --> 00:28:58,958
There's nothing I need, but
there is a place I'd like to go.

402
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,416
Why are you following me?

403
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,375
Sorry?

404
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:36,666
Why are you following me?

405
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:40,166
 It's dangerous out here.

406
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,541
Well, I guess maybe
it's not dangerous for you.

407
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:45,875
But you... you don't
have a cell phone, and I do,

408
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:49,125
so if Sirrut needed you,
I could help you out.

409
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:49,875
You see?

410
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:50,500
Yes?

411
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:51,625
Yes.

412
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,458
Really?

413
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:56,541
You mean you want to
go through that again?

414
00:29:56,625 --> 00:29:59,666
No, I just wanted
to be with you.

415
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,166
Why's that?

416
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,583
I don't know.

417
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:20,500
That's so crazy.

418
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:24,916
All this time, I never knew a
mansion like this was out here.

419
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,416
So you can see it?

420
00:30:27,416 --> 00:30:28,416
What do you mean?

421
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,875
So I can see what?

422
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,375
This isn't a mansion.

423
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:39,125
It's a shop.

424
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:53,458
It's been a long time, Saya.

425
00:30:54,958 --> 00:30:58,125
It's only been six months;
that's not that long.

426
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:08,625
I meant that it's
been a long time

427
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:11,333
since I've seen the real Saya.

428
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:55,875
Here you go.

429
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:58,000
Oh. Yes, thank you very much.

430
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:02,750
Saya?

431
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:05,416
None for me.

432
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,500
Wow. It's delicious.

433
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:14,083
I'm glad you like it.

434
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:15,166
So.

435
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,208
So um what does
this shop sell exactly?

436
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:20,666
We don't sell; we grant wishes.

437
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,833
Wishes?

438
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:24,791
I deal in odd-jobs,
you could say.

439
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:26,833
Um.

440
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:27,916
Saya.

441
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,625
Do you come here
often to make wishes?

442
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:32,750
No, only once in a while.

443
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:35,541
Right now, I just know they
happen to have what I want.

444
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:37,125
It's true.

445
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:41,541
Saya, I was quite surprised to
see you with a friend, I mean.

446
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:43,500
Actually, I just followed her.

447
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:46,583
Only because she
allowed you to, Mana.

448
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:50,625
I was with you in Ukishima.

449
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:53,416
We can both give thanks
to this little one for that.

450
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,958
I have to apologize
for not being more help.

451
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:57,125
Yet as it turned out.

452
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,291
You recovered your
true self on your own.

453
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:00,666
Even still.

454
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:04,375
The words you spoke were
the key and are appreciated.

455
00:33:04,458 --> 00:33:07,208
And now, you're here?

456
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:08,041
I am.

457
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:09,083
I need a sword.

458
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:10,250
A new one.

459
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:11,166
Strong.

460
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,708
Can you help me?

461
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:21,916
Wow.

462
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,208
Lots of weird stuff in here.

463
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:52,791
I had a feeling
you'd choose that one.

464
00:33:57,791 --> 00:33:59,250
What does it cost?

465
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:07,083
We'll discuss price later.

466
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:09,875
Very well.

467
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:13,250
Hey, wait for me!

468
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:26,125
Do you think you could
stay by her side for me?

469
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:27,375
Please?

470
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:29,958
I don't know.

471
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:31,291
I um...

472
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:33,833
I kinda have a feeling
I'm annoying her.

473
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:35,000
I doubt that.

474
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:37,458
You were able to enter my shop.

475
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:39,458
That should be more than enough.

476
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:41,916
So, um.

477
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,625
So how do you
two know each other?

478
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,166
Shop owner and customer.

479
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,333
That's it.

480
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:50,083
However, when both
have lived as long as

481
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:53,208
we have, you get attached.

482
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:08,208
It's interesting.

483
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:09,583
Isn't it?

484
00:35:09,666 --> 00:35:12,500
The threads of fate
already connect them.

485
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:14,458
Saya, wait up!

486
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:20,333
A message from
the Tokyo Government.

487
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:23,041
It is now past eight pm.

488
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:26,083
Under the Youth Protection Act,
minors can circulate

489
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:30,083
after nine pm only with
a guardian or a permit.

490
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:34,791
Minors without permission
are to return home immediately.

491
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:37,416
A message from
the Tokyo Government.

492
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,125
It is now past eight pm.

493
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:43,250
Under the Youth Protection Act,
minors can circulate

494
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:46,916
after nine pm only with
a guardian or a permit...

495
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,833
One more sec.

496
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:49,291
Sorry.

497
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:51,750
I'm just letting everyone
know where we are and stuff.

498
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:53,750
What's "and stuff"?

499
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:55,500
They are.

500
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:57,125
They're called "watchers."

501
00:35:57,208 --> 00:35:59,125
You heard that
announcement, right?

502
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:02,416
As minors we can't be out
without permission after nine,

503
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,708
and they're the ones
who enforce the law.

504
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:07,000
They're not nice
about it, either.

505
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:07,916
I hate that curfew.

506
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,916
Time to go home, kids.

507
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,333
We know.

508
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:17,250
They're horrible.

509
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:19,750
That's why so many rumors
were spread about you online.

510
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:25,625
You're the mysterious girl
who walks alone at night

511
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:28,041
and ignores the Act
like she doesn't care.

512
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:35,416
Rumors should never be ignored.

513
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,458
Some of them hide
real information,

514
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:42,208
like with Seventh Heaven or
sometimes even about the Tower.

515
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:43,458
Makes me wonder.

516
00:36:43,541 --> 00:36:46,416
Is the Act supposed
to keep us from truth?

517
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,666
The internet's a
lot faster than TV,

518
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,791
and, you know, pretty much
makes newspapers irrelevant.

519
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:53,916
It's harder to hide
what's going on;

520
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,625
people can get information
as soon as it's happening.

521
00:36:56,708 --> 00:37:00,166
And, well, people
who are online the most...

522
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,666
They're the younger ones.

523
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,375
Exactly.

524
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:05,208
They might be trying to
keep the next generation

525
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:08,583
from questioning the
Tower, or the government,

526
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:10,958
or who knows what, really.

527
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:13,750
At least that's what
Mister Mogari says.

528
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:17,666
It makes you curious about what
could be worth so much effort.

529
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:22,208
And then there's Fumito.

530
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:23,791
He's-- Ugh!

531
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,333
Oh, I'm so sorry.

532
00:37:25,416 --> 00:37:27,416
I've been doing all
the talking, haven't I?

533
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,083
Hold up, you two!

534
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:35,666
What's wrong?

535
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,833
It's only just after eight.

536
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:41,625
This isn't about the time.

537
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:43,083
It's about her.

538
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:44,250
Do you have your ID.

539
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:46,541
I'm gonna need you
to hand that over, okay?

540
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:48,291
Gotta check something.

541
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:49,750
Hey!

542
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:50,958
Wait!

543
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:52,083
Come back here.

544
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:52,958
Now!

545
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:54,458
What do you think you're doing?

546
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:58,833
What?!

547
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:00,500
You're gonna pay for that!

548
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:18,500
Number thirty-one, twenty-five.

549
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:20,083
Please check in.

550
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:22,625
Thirty-one, Twenty-five,
please check in.

551
00:38:24,208 --> 00:38:27,208
She is like completely awesome.

552
00:38:27,291 --> 00:38:28,291
What are you doing?

553
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:29,750
We need to get out of here.

554
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:39,458
Like I said.

555
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:43,125
That was way too dangerous!

556
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:44,750
I said I'm sorry.

557
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,708
How bad was it?

558
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:49,958
Do you think they could
have found out about us?

559
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:51,666
No, I seriously doubt it.

560
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,416
They barely looked at me;
they were focused on Saya.

561
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,458
Why were they talking to her?

562
00:38:57,916 --> 00:38:59,291
Who knows?

563
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:01,875
But she took those watchers
down like it was nothing.

564
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:04,875
For what it's worth, she
kept me from getting hurt.

565
00:39:04,958 --> 00:39:06,583
That makes me glad.

566
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:07,375
Me too, Tsuki.

567
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:08,916
Me too.

568
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,416
If it happens again, you just
run and leave her ass there.

569
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,791
Let Miss Gloom and Doom
deal with it on her own.

570
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:17,041
She's still super pretty.

571
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:19,166
Whatever; she's
not my type at all.

572
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:23,000
No, of course she's not;
your type is Yanagi, isn't it?

573
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:23,958
No!

574
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:25,666
It's not, you idiot!

575
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:30,166
I think you should
have just left her, too.

576
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,583
Try to understand.

577
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:34,791
I know going was dangerous,
but I couldn't help it.

578
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:35,791
Y'know?

579
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:37,458
You can't ignore her?

580
00:39:38,791 --> 00:39:40,291
Yeah.

581
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:42,208
That's kind of it.

582
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:47,708
Mana.

583
00:39:47,791 --> 00:39:51,000
I'm sorry, I-I couldn't find
more info on your dad.

584
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:52,375
I did try.

585
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:55,375
It's been four
months already, huh?

586
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:56,541
Wow.

587
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:02,833
You might need to start
facing that chance that-

588
00:40:02,916 --> 00:40:04,000
No, it's okay!

589
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:05,208
I'll work harder.

590
00:40:05,291 --> 00:40:06,500
I'll cover for you.

591
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:09,458
So please, don't worry, Mana.

592
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:10,541
I'll find him.

593
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:11,875
I swear it.

594
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,750
Oh, sweetie.

595
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,333
She's right.

596
00:40:20,416 --> 00:40:21,458
Heck, yeah.

597
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:23,083
Damn right, she's
right; we're a team!

598
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:25,416
We are Sirrut,
and we take down evil!

599
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,791
Bring it on!

600
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:28,416
--Nothing's gonna stop us!
--Thanks, you guys.

601
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,333
--Nothing, am I right?
--Thank you.

602
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:43,291
I see you have a sword, now.

603
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:45,958
I'm guessing for a purpose.

604
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:52,083
You're planning to
kill Fumito with it?

605
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,750
Correct.

606
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:57,333
Mister Mogari, I'm sorry,

607
00:40:57,416 --> 00:41:00,250
but I have to say, carrying
a weapon inside this building

608
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:01,708
may not be the best idea.

609
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:03,208
No, it's fine.

610
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:05,416
Don't worry; I'll be sure to
prepare a special covering

611
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,000
so no one gets suspicious.

612
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:22,875
Do you mind if I call you Saya?

613
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:24,666
Do as you like.

614
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:28,458
The Tower is searching
for you specifically, Saya.

615
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:31,291
According to the
information Tsukiyama found,

616
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:35,750
the Tower has contacted the city
government via Seventh Heaven.

617
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:37,375
They've increased
the number of watchers

618
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:41,791
in this town for
one reason: to find you.

619
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,375
Next time,
I would appreciate it

620
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:45,833
if you refrained
from such actions.

621
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:48,541
I have no intention
of obeying your orders.

622
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:50,083
Yes, I know.

623
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:52,833
But still, if you want revenge,
you must await your moment.

624
00:41:52,916 --> 00:41:55,000
Trust me, it will come.

625
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:59,541
In fact, I will ensure it,
no matter what.

626
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,916
What happened
between the two of you?

627
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,375
What did he do?

628
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:09,583
It's complicated.

629
00:42:09,666 --> 00:42:12,208
Fumito and I are cousins.

630
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:22,583
Come with me, if you'd like.

631
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:29,458
You've heard of the
Shrovetide, I'm sure?

632
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:31,083
Yes.

633
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:33,000
It's the ultimate pact.

634
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,166
One between humans
and Elder Bairns.

635
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,541
They are allowed to eat humans,

636
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:40,875
but only a prearranged,
agreed upon number.

637
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:43,625
The Shrovetide Covenant.

638
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:49,708
Fumito and I are
members of certain clans.

639
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:53,000
These clans have not
only hidden the Shrovetide,

640
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:55,750
but they've perpetuated
it for generations.

641
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:58,791
We are descended from those

642
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:02,125
who originally forged the
Covenant with the Elder Bairns.

643
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:11,833
My family, The Mogaris,
took a more open role.

644
00:43:11,916 --> 00:43:13,166
We worked with political leaders

645
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,833
to conceal the
Covenant's existence.

646
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:17,625
The Nanaharas, Fumito's clan,

647
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:21,083
secretly protected the
Mogaris with their magic crafts.

648
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:23,958
Together, they were
known as the Tower.

649
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:27,916
But then, Fumito
broke the rules.

650
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:44,333
You are the first person I have
ever brought to this place.

651
00:43:49,708 --> 00:43:51,458
Six years ago

652
00:43:51,541 --> 00:43:53,583
Fumito showed up here.

653
00:43:53,666 --> 00:43:55,875
He had a squad of
armed men with him.

654
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:02,666
His goal was to take
control of the Covenant.

655
00:44:08,958 --> 00:44:12,416
He killed my father,
the Mogari clan leader.

656
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,583
He murdered my mother, as well.

657
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:19,166
He took them away
right in front of me.

658
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:25,833
He took everything.

659
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:33,791
Saya.

660
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:36,000
I'm asking you.

661
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:38,416
Please, kill him for me.

662
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:46,583
I'm going to kill Fumito
for my own reasons.

663
00:44:46,666 --> 00:44:48,875
They've nothing to do with you.

664
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:52,291
Yes.

665
00:44:52,375 --> 00:44:55,166
Although, I'm sure
you have to admit.

666
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:57,541
You understand my pain.

667
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:45,416
Welcome back.

668
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,750
Or not.

669
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:48,416
It's whatever.

670
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:52,166
I wanted.

671
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:56,125
I, uhh... I wanted
to tell you thank you.

672
00:45:56,208 --> 00:45:57,625
Thank me? Why?

673
00:45:57,708 --> 00:45:59,458
For saving me
from those watchers.

674
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:01,458
They were after me, not you.

675
00:46:02,625 --> 00:46:04,958
Well, you didn't have
to take me away, though.

676
00:46:05,041 --> 00:46:06,500
So thank y...

677
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,125
Um.

678
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:19,125
What is it?

679
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:21,000
Just wanted to say goodnight.

680
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:32,833
Mana, tomorrow
you're going to try

681
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:34,833
to talk to her longer, okay?

682
00:46:34,916 --> 00:46:36,708
You can do one more minute!

683
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,666
Saya.

684
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,583
Saya.

685
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:02,208
Saya.

686
00:47:02,583 --> 00:47:03,041
Saya.

687
00:47:03,583 --> 00:47:04,041
Saya.

688
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:05,291
Saya.

689
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:06,375
Saya.

690
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:08,958
Saya.

691
00:47:09,041 --> 00:47:09,458
Saya.

692
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:10,375
Saya.

693
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:11,250
Saya.

694
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:31,291
Stop it!

695
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,750
Saya.

696
00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:04,416
You were so lovely at Ukishima;
all your memories wiped out,

697
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:08,708
but there was something
else I was drawn to more.

698
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:10,208
Mister Nanahara.

699
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:12,666
Everything is ready, sir.

700
00:48:14,166 --> 00:48:15,333
Wonderful.

701
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:19,416
We will see each other.

702
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,166
One more time, Saya.

703
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:37,125
Look at those cute little
paws; I can't stand it!

704
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,583
Have you ever thought about

705
00:48:40,666 --> 00:48:42,875
asking Tsuki or Fuji
to give you lessons?

706
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:47,000
It wouldn't work; I'm illiterate

707
00:48:47,083 --> 00:48:49,250
when it comes to the
internet or computers.

708
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:52,916
Text messaging is
about the most I can do.

709
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,166
You know, my actual job is
as Mister Mogari's assistant.

710
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:58,958
But I'm managing to
help out elsewhere anyway.

711
00:48:59,041 --> 00:49:01,416
Well, I'm so sorry.

712
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,333
Not everyone is
super-awesome like you.

713
00:49:04,416 --> 00:49:05,500
You're such a brat.

714
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:07,041
Is that supposed to
make me feel guilty?

715
00:49:07,125 --> 00:49:08,291
Hey.

716
00:49:08,375 --> 00:49:09,458
Look.

717
00:49:09,541 --> 00:49:10,666
My job is doing the
driving and dealing

718
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:11,958
with other non-computer
related issues.

719
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:13,125
What?

720
00:49:23,208 --> 00:49:26,208
Honestly.

721
00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:27,375
Is something wrong?

722
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:28,833
You seem upset.

723
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,125
I didn't make it to my
one-minute goal with her.

724
00:49:32,208 --> 00:49:33,250
I suck.

725
00:49:34,625 --> 00:49:36,041
I'm jealous.

726
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:38,958
You and Matsuo seem
to get along so well.

727
00:49:40,791 --> 00:49:41,750
What?

728
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:44,250
What makes you
think we get along?

729
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:45,833
Why're you so defensive?

730
00:49:46,875 --> 00:49:49,541
No, I didn't mean it like that.

731
00:49:49,625 --> 00:49:51,083
I did it!

732
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,208
I found part of
Fumito's schedule.

733
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:57,500
Not the whole thing,
but I still found it!

734
00:49:57,583 --> 00:49:58,708
Awesome!

735
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:02,291
A high school?

736
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:03,708
Yes.

737
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:07,166
Seventh Heaven donates a
whole bunch of money to it.

738
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:08,583
So, he'll be there.

739
00:50:08,666 --> 00:50:11,250
Yeah, well there are a
lot of places like that.

740
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:13,208
They don't just
donate to schools.

741
00:50:13,291 --> 00:50:14,750
They give out money all over.

742
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:17,041
Orphanages,
hospitals, you name it.

743
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:18,000
You sure?

744
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:19,291
We are.

745
00:50:19,375 --> 00:50:20,708
Tsuki and I split up
their charitable donations

746
00:50:20,791 --> 00:50:22,166
and checked them all out.

747
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,208
And then- Bingo!

748
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:26,125
Tsuki found it.

749
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:27,541
Yeah.

750
00:50:29,541 --> 00:50:31,916
Tsuji's a private Academy.

751
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,166
Fumito will be there tomorrow

752
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:35,666
to give a guest lecture
during an open assembly.

753
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:36,750
Impressive.

754
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:38,500
I don't know how
you do it, Tsuki.

755
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:39,791
Hey, that's not all.

756
00:50:39,875 --> 00:50:42,708
We found a bunch of
gaps in the security, too.

757
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:45,000
Tsuki found those.

758
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,208
And you're certain of this?

759
00:50:54,958 --> 00:50:56,750
Hacking skills are
very important,

760
00:50:56,833 --> 00:50:59,833
but that won't matter if you
can't verify the information.

761
00:50:59,916 --> 00:51:01,708
Least that's what I was taught.

762
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:05,208
Well then.

763
00:51:05,291 --> 00:51:07,166
Saya?

764
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:07,875
I'll go.

765
00:51:07,958 --> 00:51:08,791
Oh, come on!

766
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:10,833
You can't be serious, lady.

767
00:51:10,916 --> 00:51:13,791
They're gonna have security
literally swarming that place.

768
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:15,916
You can't just waltz right in.

769
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,833
I doubt if you'll even be able
to make it past the front gates.

770
00:51:18,916 --> 00:51:20,375
Don't worry, guys!

771
00:51:20,458 --> 00:51:22,166
I took care of everything!

772
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:24,333
I found out the locations
of all the guards.

773
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:26,708
Well, look at you go, Fujimura.

774
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:30,416
And what about the
uniforms, genius?

775
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,666
I thought the idea

776
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:33,416
was we were gonna sneak
in there as students.

777
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,250
Where do you figure
we'll get those costumes?

778
00:51:35,333 --> 00:51:36,958
Unless you know how to sew.

779
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:38,000
Do you?

780
00:51:38,083 --> 00:51:40,000
Actually.

781
00:51:40,083 --> 00:51:42,916
I might be able to do
something about that.

782
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:16,083
Well, at least the weather
today is awesome, right?

783
00:52:17,416 --> 00:52:19,458
Wait for me, Saya!

784
00:52:19,541 --> 00:52:21,291
The sound's working fine.

785
00:52:24,666 --> 00:52:26,500
And the GPS is on target, too.

786
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:30,875
Dude, how did we not know Mana
was a student at Tsuji Academy?

787
00:52:34,833 --> 00:52:36,500
That's not that big of a deal.

788
00:52:36,583 --> 00:52:40,333
The thing I don't get is why she
asked Mogari to let her go, too.

789
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:42,750
Mister Mogari.

790
00:52:42,833 --> 00:52:45,000
Will please you let me
go along with Saya?

791
00:52:45,083 --> 00:52:46,291
Please let me go!

792
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,708
Saya?

793
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:55,666
Do as you like.

794
00:52:58,333 --> 00:52:59,708
Well, whatever the reason.

795
00:52:59,791 --> 00:53:01,625
There's no way we're
letting Mana down.

796
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:02,666
Right.

797
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:04,750
Agreed.

798
00:53:04,833 --> 00:53:07,166
Guys, if something goes
wrong and it gets nasty.

799
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,583
Be sure to go in
after them, immediately.

800
00:53:09,666 --> 00:53:10,750
Got it!

801
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:16,083
Just so you know,
I'm pretty worried, too.

802
00:53:16,166 --> 00:53:19,083
But we'll do whatever we can to
help them out from here, okay?

803
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:20,500
Yeah. Okay.

804
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:30,208
It's funny.

805
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:31,458
You don't seem like
this is the first time

806
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,958
that you've ever been here.

807
00:53:33,041 --> 00:53:35,500
Being too cautious
only makes you stand out.

808
00:53:35,583 --> 00:53:37,583
Oh yeah, I guess
that makes sense.

809
00:53:38,791 --> 00:53:40,250
Did you know about this?

810
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:41,375
About what?

811
00:53:41,458 --> 00:53:42,833
About this school.

812
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:45,541
Did you know that it was
connected to Seventh Heaven?

813
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,791
Yeah.

814
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:49,125
There's a plaque
the school made

815
00:53:49,208 --> 00:53:50,875
to thank them for
their donations.

816
00:53:50,958 --> 00:53:53,083
And also, the teachers
are always talking

817
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:54,958
about it like nonstop.

818
00:53:56,416 --> 00:54:00,000
I really wanted to
drop out, but I didn't.

819
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:04,666
Mana!

820
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:07,000
You made it!

821
00:54:07,083 --> 00:54:07,791
Oh.

822
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:09,000
Yeah.

823
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:10,916
I figured you'd
skip this assembly.

824
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,208
It's like the middle
of winter break, y'know?

825
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:16,041
So how's it been going
living all by yourself?

826
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:17,583
You doing okay?

827
00:54:17,666 --> 00:54:19,208
Yeah.

828
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:21,208
I heard about what
happened to your dad.

829
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:22,541
I'm so sorry.

830
00:54:22,625 --> 00:54:24,000
We're glad you're
doing well, though.

831
00:54:24,083 --> 00:54:24,791
Oh.

832
00:54:24,875 --> 00:54:25,583
Thank you.

833
00:54:25,666 --> 00:54:27,041
Good to see you all.

834
00:54:28,375 --> 00:54:29,791
Let's go.

835
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:40,375
Hey, lucky us!

836
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:42,958
Looks like they're not going to
divide us up by classes today.

837
00:54:43,041 --> 00:54:44,000
Um.

838
00:54:44,083 --> 00:54:45,666
That's what they
would normally do.

839
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,833
What did those girls mean?

840
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:49,208
About your father.

841
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,500
Just asking.

842
00:54:52,583 --> 00:54:53,541
Never mind.

843
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,541
Everyone, please be quiet...

844
00:54:57,625 --> 00:55:01,000
We will now begin today's
very special lecture.

845
00:55:01,083 --> 00:55:04,208
Please welcome
Mister Fumito Nanahara.

846
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,375
From Seventh Heaven?

847
00:55:07,458 --> 00:55:08,875
Seriously?

848
00:55:08,958 --> 00:55:10,666
So, that's why they wouldn't
let us bring in our phones.

849
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:12,333
I wonder why he's talking to us.

850
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:34,125
What?

851
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:36,875
Please remain calm.

852
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,458
Obey the staff's instructions,

853
00:55:38,541 --> 00:55:41,666
and evacuate the hall
in an orderly fashion.

854
00:55:44,083 --> 00:55:45,916
Saya, we have to get out!

855
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,333
Come on!

856
00:55:56,666 --> 00:55:57,750
Mana!

857
00:55:57,833 --> 00:55:59,208
What's going on down there?

858
00:55:59,291 --> 00:56:00,791
I-I don't know!

859
00:56:00,875 --> 00:56:02,916
I heard screams
just after the bell.

860
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,750
I can't tell. I have no idea!

861
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:06,875
But their position
hasn't moved at all.

862
00:56:11,916 --> 00:56:14,333
It's been too long, Saya.

863
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,208
Saya!

864
00:56:26,333 --> 00:56:29,458
Fumito!!!

865
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:37,250
Saya.

866
00:56:37,333 --> 00:56:39,416
You came all this way for me.

867
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,916
I'm flattered.

868
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,041
And yet, I must apologize.

869
00:56:43,125 --> 00:56:44,666
I'm sure you understand.

870
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:47,416
You're so strong;
I had to take precautions.

871
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:52,166
But I wonder, will you at
least play with me awhile?

872
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:07,750
So close.

873
00:57:07,833 --> 00:57:09,458
Why?

874
00:57:09,541 --> 00:57:10,125
Saya!

875
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:12,083
Saya!

876
00:58:35,083 --> 00:58:36,041
Saya!

877
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:46,000
Get down!

878
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:55,833
Saya.

879
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:58,208
Saya!

880
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:01,375
Saya!

881
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:02,291
Matsuo?

882
00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:03,333
What?

883
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,041
Let's get them out of there!

884
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:08,291
All right.

885
00:59:09,791 --> 00:59:11,958
Hang on to what you got!

886
00:59:16,083 --> 00:59:17,291
You're bleeding.

887
00:59:49,958 --> 00:59:51,208
Saya.

888
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:27,875
Mana.

889
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:28,916
Let's go!

890
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,041
'Kay.

891
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:46,291
I will go.

892
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:48,708
The rest of you
recover it immediately.

893
01:00:59,583 --> 01:01:01,791
Saya, please move!

894
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:03,375
I think I can open it.

895
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:07,166
So, you're Saya.

896
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:11,750
What's wrong?

897
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:13,666
Are you in pain?

898
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:15,791
You're a freak,
just like that monster.

899
01:01:15,875 --> 01:01:17,083
Shut up!

900
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:33,541
Saya!

901
01:01:33,625 --> 01:01:35,291
Don't worry about me; go!

902
01:01:37,375 --> 01:01:38,416
You're done.

903
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:50,666
It's a shame you
can't kill humans.

904
01:01:55,666 --> 01:01:56,833
I got it!

905
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,750
If you could,

906
01:02:01,833 --> 01:02:04,916
you might have a better chance
at protecting your friends.

907
01:02:13,583 --> 01:02:15,166
Get in!

908
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:16,916
Come on, let's go!

909
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:30,250
She needs a doctor!

910
01:02:36,208 --> 01:02:38,666
Unfortunately, she fled.

911
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:40,083
What a shame.

912
01:02:41,583 --> 01:02:44,666
We recovered the blood
per your previous orders.

913
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:47,750
I'll take it to the lab as
soon as we're done here.

914
01:02:47,833 --> 01:02:49,666
Nicely done, Kuto.

915
01:03:02,166 --> 01:03:06,125
Basically, the entire
thing was a set up.

916
01:03:06,208 --> 01:03:08,250
I'm sorry.

917
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:10,416
Tsuki.

918
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,708
This wasn't your fault at all.

919
01:03:13,875 --> 01:03:15,833
I confirmed the
information provided

920
01:03:15,916 --> 01:03:18,666
as well as approved the plan.

921
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:21,541
It's my responsibility.

922
01:03:21,625 --> 01:03:23,375
It's cool.

923
01:03:23,458 --> 01:03:24,708
Well.

924
01:03:24,791 --> 01:03:27,166
I'm just glad everyone
made it out in one piece.

925
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:28,000
Yeah.

926
01:03:28,083 --> 01:03:29,708
Except for my car, that is.

927
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:32,083
She's wrecked again!

928
01:03:32,166 --> 01:03:34,333
Another noble sacrifice.

929
01:03:34,416 --> 01:03:37,333
Well, considering somebody
actually did get hurt.

930
01:03:37,416 --> 01:03:39,625
I guess it's not
that big of a deal.

931
01:03:39,708 --> 01:03:41,875
Right?

932
01:03:41,958 --> 01:03:43,250
Yeah, I mean,
I thought you didn't

933
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:45,833
even like Saya,
but it's whatever, man.

934
01:03:45,916 --> 01:03:48,791
Look, I can't ignore that
she was protecting Mana.

935
01:03:48,875 --> 01:03:52,166
She could have just left her
there to die if she wanted.

936
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:54,541
I don't mind changing
my opinion, bro.

937
01:03:54,625 --> 01:03:57,375
Not if that's what
she's really like.

938
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:58,500
Where is Saya?

939
01:03:58,583 --> 01:04:00,875
She said no doctors,
so Mana got mad

940
01:04:00,958 --> 01:04:04,458
and ran down the hall after
her; I imagine to her room.

941
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:07,041
That was a high
tech electronic lock.

942
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:09,416
Mana's the one who
opened it, right?

943
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,791
Seems that way.

944
01:04:11,875 --> 01:04:12,958
You mean.

945
01:04:13,041 --> 01:04:14,625
Mana hacked something?

946
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:16,750
That she did.

947
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:19,375
And in like no time at all, too.

948
01:04:19,458 --> 01:04:20,625
That's good news.

949
01:04:20,708 --> 01:04:21,916
Our other genius hacker

950
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
is proving rather
impressive herself.

951
01:04:24,083 --> 01:04:25,583
Of course she is!

952
01:04:25,666 --> 01:04:27,750
Mana is incredible!

953
01:04:27,833 --> 01:04:30,416
I learned from her;
she's the best.

954
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,625
I'm not nearly as good.

955
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:38,083
If anything, this could
help her regain confidence.

956
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:39,416
I hope.

957
01:04:45,541 --> 01:04:47,500
Stop!

958
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:49,958
I said stop!

959
01:04:50,041 --> 01:04:52,833
There's no way you're fine
after getting hurt like that!

960
01:04:52,916 --> 01:04:55,416
It's not as bad
as it looks, Mana.

961
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,708
Saya!

962
01:05:06,916 --> 01:05:08,458
I'm really sorry.

963
01:05:10,875 --> 01:05:13,666
Don't be; there's
nothing to be sorry for.

964
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:18,583
I don't want this.

965
01:05:18,666 --> 01:05:21,458
I don't want it to happen again.

966
01:05:21,541 --> 01:05:23,250
Not because of me.

967
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:29,708
I really am alright.

968
01:05:29,791 --> 01:05:31,250
The wounds are healing.

969
01:05:37,666 --> 01:05:39,208
They really are.

970
01:05:40,916 --> 01:05:42,625
But how?

971
01:05:42,708 --> 01:05:44,041
Whatever the reason.

972
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:46,416
What's important is I'm fine.

973
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,458
Do you understand?

974
01:05:51,458 --> 01:05:54,375
Why did you say "again"?

975
01:05:54,458 --> 01:05:56,666
Has something like
this happened before?

976
01:06:08,166 --> 01:06:09,000
Sorta.

977
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:10,333
My mom died when I was little,

978
01:06:10,416 --> 01:06:13,791
so it's just been me and
my dad for the most part.

979
01:06:13,875 --> 01:06:16,708
He was really awful
at cooking and stuff.

980
01:06:16,791 --> 01:06:18,291
But he always did
his absolute best

981
01:06:18,375 --> 01:06:20,833
to make something
I'd at least eat.

982
01:06:20,916 --> 01:06:24,208
He was always so
busy with his job.

983
01:06:24,291 --> 01:06:27,500
He still found a way to cook
for me everyday, though.

984
01:06:28,791 --> 01:06:29,750
His job?

985
01:06:29,833 --> 01:06:31,208
Newspaper reporter.

986
01:06:33,916 --> 01:06:36,333
He liked the old
fashioned newspapers,

987
01:06:36,416 --> 01:06:38,625
printed and all of that.

988
01:06:38,708 --> 01:06:41,208
When he'd been drinking,
he liked to say:

989
01:06:41,291 --> 01:06:45,541
"What a reporter needs is
curiosity and inquisitiveness."

990
01:06:45,625 --> 01:06:50,250
He taught me to take an interest
in anything and everything.

991
01:06:50,333 --> 01:06:51,625
And most importantly,

992
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:54,875
he told me not to let
other people decide for me.

993
01:06:54,958 --> 01:06:56,833
"You should always take
care of your own research

994
01:06:56,916 --> 01:06:58,458
and make your own decisions."

995
01:06:58,541 --> 01:07:01,125
He had a bunch of
quotes like that about life.

996
01:07:01,208 --> 01:07:03,416
His favorite was, "When you
decide to do something,

997
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,791
you should follow it
through until the end."

998
01:07:08,166 --> 01:07:09,291
A year ago.

999
01:07:09,375 --> 01:07:11,958
He had an idea; he'd
focus his next article

1000
01:07:12,041 --> 01:07:15,000
on an exclusive
about Seventh Heaven.

1001
01:07:15,083 --> 01:07:17,166
Eventually, pressure
came from higher up,

1002
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:19,708
and the project was cancelled.

1003
01:07:19,791 --> 01:07:22,125
But my dad refused to quit.

1004
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:24,583
He said he would
write the article anyway.

1005
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:26,833
He wanted to find out the truth.

1006
01:07:29,333 --> 01:07:30,875
I wanted to help him,

1007
01:07:30,958 --> 01:07:33,333
so I conducted some
research of my own.

1008
01:07:36,291 --> 01:07:39,375
It helped that I was pretty
good with computers, too.

1009
01:07:42,583 --> 01:07:44,583
I hacked into
Seventh Heaven's systems

1010
01:07:44,666 --> 01:07:48,250
and discovered they were hiring
a lot of people out of the blue.

1011
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:54,041
People who, not much later,
were reported missing.

1012
01:07:54,125 --> 01:07:58,125
I also found out something
called The Tower was involved.

1013
01:07:58,208 --> 01:08:01,625
Although, I wasn't sure how.

1014
01:08:01,708 --> 01:08:03,125
Dad took the proof I'd gathered

1015
01:08:03,208 --> 01:08:07,583
and said he was gonna
meet with Fumito Nanahara.

1016
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:11,416
He thanked me for
helping him and left.

1017
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,458
And then.

1018
01:08:13,541 --> 01:08:15,500
He never came back.

1019
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:20,583
If I hadn't helped him,
then my dad wouldn't--

1020
01:08:20,666 --> 01:08:23,250
He hasn't come back,
and it's all my fault.

1021
01:08:26,833 --> 01:08:31,750
I came here cause.
I wanted to find my dad.

1022
01:08:31,833 --> 01:08:34,083
But, I was afraid
of what I might find,

1023
01:08:34,166 --> 01:08:36,708
so I stopped hacking altogether.

1024
01:08:36,791 --> 01:08:40,041
What if he...
What if he's dead?

1025
01:08:40,125 --> 01:08:44,791
I-I don't think I can
make it without him.

1026
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:55,500
What about you?

1027
01:08:55,583 --> 01:08:57,541
Your father?

1028
01:08:57,625 --> 01:09:00,250
I don't have one.

1029
01:09:00,333 --> 01:09:02,750
But I knew a man who
was like a father to me.

1030
01:09:06,166 --> 01:09:08,166
I never thought
I would miss him.

1031
01:09:12,916 --> 01:09:15,291
How do you manage
to be so strong?

1032
01:09:17,541 --> 01:09:21,041
Your father and I share
the same philosophy.

1033
01:09:21,125 --> 01:09:24,375
Whatever I start, I see
through to the bitter end.

1034
01:09:24,458 --> 01:09:26,458
No matter what, I finish it.

1035
01:09:26,541 --> 01:09:28,875
I don't give myself a choice.

1036
01:09:28,958 --> 01:09:33,000
I do it because
I have to, so I can be me.

1037
01:09:35,458 --> 01:09:37,625
Now it makes sense.

1038
01:09:37,708 --> 01:09:38,958
Why I couldn't leave you.

1039
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:42,208
Why I wanted to be near you.

1040
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:43,916
We're a lot alike.

1041
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,791
You and me.

1042
01:09:45,875 --> 01:09:47,666
We're lonely.

1043
01:10:00,083 --> 01:10:01,166
Nothing about what happened

1044
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:02,916
at the high school
is showing up.

1045
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,916
Big surprise, huh?

1046
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:05,875
Yeah, right.

1047
01:10:05,958 --> 01:10:07,000
Assholes.

1048
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:10,583
Mana and Saya
are still back there.

1049
01:10:10,666 --> 01:10:12,208
They haven't come out yet.

1050
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:14,083
She was hurt pretty bad.

1051
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:17,125
I bet Mana is
taking care of her.

1052
01:10:17,208 --> 01:10:19,791
Saya will be back
to gloomy in no time.

1053
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:23,291
Good morning, everyone.

1054
01:10:23,375 --> 01:10:24,666
Good morning!

1055
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:25,416
Hey!

1056
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,083
It's about time!

1057
01:10:27,166 --> 01:10:28,416
Sorry.

1058
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,000
We were up late last night.

1059
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:34,291
Good morning, Tsuki.

1060
01:10:38,875 --> 01:10:40,000
Mana!

1061
01:10:43,416 --> 01:10:46,083
I'm sorry the stuff
I found out was wrong.

1062
01:10:46,166 --> 01:10:48,250
I'm sorry, Saya.

1063
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:50,958
You didn't mislead us
on purpose, did you?

1064
01:10:51,041 --> 01:10:53,541
No, I would never do that.

1065
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:54,625
No.

1066
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:57,000
That's good to hear.

1067
01:10:57,083 --> 01:10:59,416
Then you have nothing
to apologize for.

1068
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:06,666
Are you... Are you hurt?

1069
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:07,625
No.

1070
01:11:07,708 --> 01:11:08,583
You mean it?

1071
01:11:08,666 --> 01:11:10,000
Yes.

1072
01:11:10,083 --> 01:11:11,208
That's nice.

1073
01:11:11,291 --> 01:11:13,916
I'm glad that you're all right.

1074
01:11:18,666 --> 01:11:19,458
So.

1075
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:21,375
I, um, just... Uh.

1076
01:11:21,458 --> 01:11:23,375
I think I might have gotten
the wrong impression of you,

1077
01:11:23,458 --> 01:11:25,583
so what a relief I was wrong.

1078
01:11:25,666 --> 01:11:28,375
If that was supposed to
be an apology, it was crap.

1079
01:11:28,458 --> 01:11:30,333
I didn't ask you!

1080
01:11:31,916 --> 01:11:33,083
Anyway!

1081
01:11:33,166 --> 01:11:35,375
Thank you for saving Mana.

1082
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:36,666
You're awesome!

1083
01:11:39,833 --> 01:11:40,875
Hey.

1084
01:11:40,958 --> 01:11:42,083
She just ignored me!

1085
01:11:42,166 --> 01:11:43,375
Can you blame her?

1086
01:11:44,583 --> 01:11:46,041
You guys.

1087
01:11:46,125 --> 01:11:48,375
I wanna talk to you
about something, okay?

1088
01:11:50,166 --> 01:11:51,250
Hacking?

1089
01:11:51,333 --> 01:11:52,333
Yes.

1090
01:11:54,083 --> 01:11:55,375
Are you sure?

1091
01:11:55,458 --> 01:11:56,666
You're ready?

1092
01:12:00,708 --> 01:12:02,333
I'm sure. Yes.

1093
01:12:02,416 --> 01:12:03,916
I'm never gonna
accomplish anything

1094
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,875
if I just keep running away.

1095
01:12:05,958 --> 01:12:09,166
I'm ready, no matter
what the result is.

1096
01:12:10,541 --> 01:12:12,666
Very well.

1097
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:13,958
Let's do it.

1098
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,833
After the events
at the Tsuji Academy,

1099
01:12:18,916 --> 01:12:22,416
they now know all about
our organization's objective.

1100
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:26,625
The Tower, Fumito, specifically,
will be coming for us.

1101
01:12:26,708 --> 01:12:30,541
We need to find the Tower's base
before they neutralize ours.

1102
01:12:30,625 --> 01:12:32,000
Everyone, bear that in mind.

1103
01:12:32,083 --> 01:12:33,208
Right.

1104
01:12:49,666 --> 01:12:52,750
You make a prisoner out
of everyone you meet.

1105
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:54,916
At least that's
what the rumors say.

1106
01:12:58,208 --> 01:12:59,458
Well, they're wrong.

1107
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,458
I don't do anything.

1108
01:13:06,416 --> 01:13:09,916
Ask, and it shall
be given to you.

1109
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,458
Seek and find.

1110
01:13:11,541 --> 01:13:13,333
Knock and the door shall open.

1111
01:13:13,416 --> 01:13:14,833
That's what we're promised.

1112
01:13:14,916 --> 01:13:17,125
Just ask the right question.

1113
01:13:17,208 --> 01:13:19,041
And yet, we humans
are still forced

1114
01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:21,291
to find the answers ourselves...

1115
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,083
Tell me.

1116
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:26,875
Do you know what
your answer is, Saya?

1117
01:14:33,208 --> 01:14:35,500
I can't believe
you got this for me.

1118
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:38,375
I just poured some of
what was already there.

1119
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:39,916
Well, thank you.

1120
01:14:41,583 --> 01:14:42,625
Didn't you want any?

1121
01:14:42,708 --> 01:14:43,833
It wasn't for me.

1122
01:14:43,916 --> 01:14:45,125
That's not true.

1123
01:14:45,208 --> 01:14:47,208
Mister Mogari made it.

1124
01:14:47,291 --> 01:14:49,000
He said it was his way
of thanking all of us

1125
01:14:49,083 --> 01:14:50,958
for the work we've been doing.

1126
01:14:51,041 --> 01:14:53,833
He wanted to do something
for everyone, including you.

1127
01:15:06,375 --> 01:15:07,833
You aren't going to rest?

1128
01:15:07,916 --> 01:15:10,041
I have a feeling I'm
really close to finding them.

1129
01:15:10,125 --> 01:15:12,333
So I can't sleep, not yet.

1130
01:15:12,416 --> 01:15:15,541
See, this is kind of like my
version of the power you have.

1131
01:15:15,625 --> 01:15:17,875
Hacking is my weapon.

1132
01:15:17,958 --> 01:15:19,500
I understand.

1133
01:15:34,416 --> 01:15:35,541
What's going on?

1134
01:15:50,375 --> 01:15:51,791
I found it, Saya.

1135
01:15:53,541 --> 01:15:55,416
The Tower's headquarters.

1136
01:16:02,666 --> 01:16:04,666
You're sure it's the
Tokyo Bay Breakwater,

1137
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:06,166
'cause that seems weird.

1138
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:07,333
She's sure.

1139
01:16:08,833 --> 01:16:11,583
You should have seen
her; it was amazing.

1140
01:16:11,666 --> 01:16:12,666
The way she dodges walls

1141
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:16,083
and pursues stuff
is almost godlike.

1142
01:16:16,166 --> 01:16:17,875
Well, then why
didn't you wake me up?

1143
01:16:17,958 --> 01:16:19,750
I enjoy godlike things.

1144
01:16:21,041 --> 01:16:24,083
I don't understand how;
there's nothing out there.

1145
01:16:24,166 --> 01:16:26,250
Well, not from an
address search, no.

1146
01:16:26,333 --> 01:16:28,083
But when you look at the
area from an aerial view,

1147
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:30,041
it's a completely
different story.

1148
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:36,625
Where?

1149
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,166
I don't see anything.

1150
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:41,625
They put false data
on the satellite image,

1151
01:16:41,708 --> 01:16:44,083
but all you have
to do is remove that.

1152
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:45,375
Watch.

1153
01:16:45,458 --> 01:16:47,333
That's crazy!

1154
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:49,416
Good job.

1155
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,791
She truly is a gifted hacker.

1156
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,750
Saya.

1157
01:16:55,833 --> 01:16:58,083
Are you ready to face Fumito?

1158
01:17:12,916 --> 01:17:15,375
I can't believe they
hid something this big.

1159
01:17:15,458 --> 01:17:17,833
Those Tower guys are good.

1160
01:17:17,916 --> 01:17:20,000
And we still managed to find it.

1161
01:17:20,083 --> 01:17:22,791
Guess that makes us better. Huh?

1162
01:17:24,916 --> 01:17:26,666
I would say that it does.

1163
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:28,666
Um, about me not going with you.

1164
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:29,750
You sure?

1165
01:17:29,833 --> 01:17:31,791
I'm sure.

1166
01:17:31,875 --> 01:17:33,875
I need you to help me from here.

1167
01:17:33,958 --> 01:17:35,750
If you go, then you'll die.

1168
01:17:35,833 --> 01:17:37,833
But Saya, what about you?

1169
01:17:37,916 --> 01:17:39,125
I'll be fine.

1170
01:17:39,208 --> 01:17:40,291
You've seen the truth.

1171
01:17:40,375 --> 01:17:42,166
Remember that.

1172
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:44,125
Most injuries won't stop me.

1173
01:17:44,208 --> 01:17:46,333
Don't you have a
weapon to use, anyway?

1174
01:17:49,541 --> 01:17:50,916
Yeah, you're right.

1175
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,208
And I still have to find my dad.

1176
01:17:58,708 --> 01:18:01,000
All we can do is support,
but we'll be here.

1177
01:18:01,083 --> 01:18:04,166
You can count on us, and you
ladies are ready, too, right?

1178
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:06,666
Definitely; we're both
ready and standing by.

1179
01:18:12,291 --> 01:18:14,291
If something happens,
let us know.

1180
01:18:14,375 --> 01:18:16,541
We'll hold out as
long as we're able to.

1181
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:19,458
If it gets bad, do
yourself a favor and run.

1182
01:18:21,083 --> 01:18:22,416
Thank you.

1183
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:30,625
Okay, we're changing positions.

1184
01:19:16,875 --> 01:19:18,041
Where's the target?

1185
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:31,250
Hey, it's goin' down.

1186
01:19:32,666 --> 01:19:33,833
Fuji.

1187
01:19:33,916 --> 01:19:36,625
Make sure we don't
lose sound with her, okay?

1188
01:19:36,708 --> 01:19:38,125
On it.

1189
01:19:43,916 --> 01:19:45,000
Hey, Tsuki.

1190
01:19:45,083 --> 01:19:47,166
Can you see what's
going on inside there?

1191
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:48,208
Gimmie a sec.

1192
01:19:48,291 --> 01:19:49,666
Got the frequency!

1193
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:51,208
Can you tell how
many there are?

1194
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:52,500
Sure thing!

1195
01:20:18,208 --> 01:20:21,250
Saya, we have their
numbers and positions.

1196
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:24,416
The farther you ascend,
the more they carry radios.

1197
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:26,500
Fumito must be on the top floor.

1198
01:20:28,041 --> 01:20:30,083
You're wrong.

1199
01:20:30,166 --> 01:20:33,166
Fumito knows about things
that aren't entirely human.

1200
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:35,916
Dangerous things
that don't use radios.

1201
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,833
Where are the Elder Bairns?

1202
01:20:39,583 --> 01:20:41,750
What area has the fewest people?

1203
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:44,208
The basement.

1204
01:20:44,291 --> 01:20:45,375
Then get me there.

1205
01:20:45,458 --> 01:20:46,583
Just a sec.

1206
01:21:05,083 --> 01:21:06,916
Nice trick, you bastard.

1207
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,375
Saya?

1208
01:21:11,458 --> 01:21:13,000
Keep going.

1209
01:21:13,083 --> 01:21:14,208
Right.

1210
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:22,916
I will never let you
reach Mister Nanahara.

1211
01:21:34,375 --> 01:21:37,750
You are pathetic, Saya Kisaragi.

1212
01:21:40,458 --> 01:21:44,833
Do not call me that name!

1213
01:21:52,875 --> 01:21:55,541
I have the route
to the basement!

1214
01:21:55,625 --> 01:21:56,750
From the elevators.

1215
01:21:56,833 --> 01:21:59,666
Take the door on the
right, far in the back.

1216
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:01,166
Saya?

1217
01:22:02,541 --> 01:22:03,625
Kuto.

1218
01:22:03,708 --> 01:22:05,041
That should be enough.

1219
01:22:10,875 --> 01:22:11,833
Of course.

1220
01:22:11,916 --> 01:22:13,833
Thank you, Mister Nanahara.

1221
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:16,916
It's time.

1222
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,208
You will now witness the power

1223
01:22:18,291 --> 01:22:20,166
of the one who
will rule the world!

1224
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:21,416
Behold.

1225
01:22:37,333 --> 01:22:39,916
Fumito!

1226
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:07,250
I can't tell what's going on.

1227
01:23:07,333 --> 01:23:08,750
Get her out of there, Mana.

1228
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:11,041
Listen, Saya, run
straight in front of you!

1229
01:23:11,125 --> 01:23:12,875
Then take the exit just ahead!

1230
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:30,000
Good job.

1231
01:23:30,083 --> 01:23:31,041
Take your next left.

1232
01:23:39,208 --> 01:23:41,750
You'll be able to reach
the lowest lever from there.

1233
01:24:00,166 --> 01:24:01,458
Saya?

1234
01:24:01,541 --> 01:24:02,375
I'm fine.

1235
01:24:02,458 --> 01:24:03,583
I made it.

1236
01:24:51,458 --> 01:24:53,041
Good evening, Saya.

1237
01:24:53,125 --> 01:24:54,375
How are you?

1238
01:24:58,083 --> 01:24:59,541
What have you done?

1239
01:25:03,541 --> 01:25:04,875
What is this?

1240
01:25:06,375 --> 01:25:09,500
I don't. Stop.

1241
01:25:11,416 --> 01:25:13,208
Fumito.

1242
01:25:14,833 --> 01:25:15,833
Saya!

1243
01:25:15,916 --> 01:25:17,250
Saya, what's wrong?!

1244
01:25:17,333 --> 01:25:18,708
No!

1245
01:25:20,208 --> 01:25:21,333
Saya!

1246
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:23,458
Saya!

1247
01:25:23,541 --> 01:25:24,916
Fuji!

1248
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
It's no use!

1249
01:25:26,083 --> 01:25:27,708
I've lost the connection!

1250
01:25:32,291 --> 01:25:33,916
I'd prefer no interruptions,

1251
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
now that we're finally together.

1252
01:25:36,083 --> 01:25:38,208
I had to shut down your radios.

1253
01:25:38,291 --> 01:25:40,000
I'm sure you understand.

1254
01:25:41,083 --> 01:25:43,416
I'm delighted
you came to see me.

1255
01:25:44,541 --> 01:25:48,000
Although, I do wish you hadn't
broken so many of my things.

1256
01:26:00,458 --> 01:26:01,375
Yes.

1257
01:26:01,458 --> 01:26:05,041
It's finally taken
effect, Kuroto.

1258
01:26:05,125 --> 01:26:08,375
I brought the
amount you requested.

1259
01:26:08,458 --> 01:26:10,375
It took long enough.

1260
01:26:10,458 --> 01:26:13,791
All that running,
and she's only down now.

1261
01:26:13,875 --> 01:26:15,666
What a freak.

1262
01:26:23,875 --> 01:26:25,166
The coffee.

1263
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:26,708
No.

1264
01:26:29,875 --> 01:26:32,083
Will you tell me
now why I personally

1265
01:26:32,166 --> 01:26:34,500
had to put that
stuff in her coffee?

1266
01:26:34,583 --> 01:26:36,875
Your young assistants
are just so good.

1267
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:40,541
They'd never imagine slipping
something bad into her drink.

1268
01:26:40,625 --> 01:26:42,166
Luckily, I had you.

1269
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:44,291
"Good" is not your forte.

1270
01:26:46,708 --> 01:26:48,333
This doesn't work on humans.

1271
01:26:48,416 --> 01:26:51,666
It's for you and
you alone, my Saya.

1272
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:54,333
You must be worried about
your little Sirrut friends.

1273
01:26:54,416 --> 01:26:55,833
They are gifted, aren't they?

1274
01:26:57,458 --> 01:27:00,083
In fact, you can thank them for
getting you to where you are.

1275
01:27:00,166 --> 01:27:02,375
You were too suspicious
to eat anything.

1276
01:27:02,458 --> 01:27:04,541
But you let your guard down.

1277
01:27:04,625 --> 01:27:06,666
With that coffee.

1278
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:08,125
Who'd have imagined?

1279
01:27:08,208 --> 01:27:10,250
Those kids were useful.

1280
01:27:10,333 --> 01:27:14,083
Don't get the wrong idea:
I never lied to them per se.

1281
01:27:14,166 --> 01:27:17,875
All I did was just
use them a little.

1282
01:27:17,958 --> 01:27:20,791
Sirrut originated as
a small internet group.

1283
01:27:20,875 --> 01:27:24,583
They were full of all those
"more freedom in Tokyo" types.

1284
01:27:24,666 --> 01:27:25,833
I know what you're thinking;

1285
01:27:25,916 --> 01:27:28,041
I should've just ignored them.

1286
01:27:28,125 --> 01:27:30,208
But you can never predict
what someone on the internet

1287
01:27:30,291 --> 01:27:31,958
might do to people like us,

1288
01:27:32,041 --> 01:27:35,250
so I decided to keep
an eye on them myself.

1289
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:38,958
I offered financial support and
became their mentor and patron.

1290
01:27:39,041 --> 01:27:41,500
They believed any and
every bit of information

1291
01:27:41,583 --> 01:27:45,208
I 'leaked' to them, which
made things very easy.

1292
01:27:45,291 --> 01:27:47,541
I was impressed with myself.

1293
01:27:47,625 --> 01:27:50,750
Eventually, they found
fascinating leads about you,

1294
01:27:50,833 --> 01:27:54,333
resulting in your
arrival in my mansion.

1295
01:27:54,416 --> 01:27:58,875
I admit, I never expected
Mana would find this place.

1296
01:27:58,958 --> 01:28:02,083
She is a talented girl.

1297
01:28:02,166 --> 01:28:04,833
But, I did immediately
let Fumito know

1298
01:28:04,916 --> 01:28:07,291
they had found him.

1299
01:28:07,375 --> 01:28:08,375
So then.

1300
01:28:08,458 --> 01:28:10,375
What's next, dear cousin?

1301
01:28:10,458 --> 01:28:12,375
You do have a plan, yes?

1302
01:28:12,458 --> 01:28:16,125
I still don't get why you spend
so much effort on that thing.

1303
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:19,125
I spend effort
because Saya is special.

1304
01:28:19,208 --> 01:28:21,291
Yes, I suppose she must be.

1305
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:24,333
You did dedicate all
of our resources to her.

1306
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:29,875
Our arrangement was to
kill each other's families,

1307
01:28:29,958 --> 01:28:34,125
take control over The Tower,
and use the power we had stolen,

1308
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:36,916
to seize control of
the world, correct?

1309
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:37,666
Oh, yes.

1310
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:39,000
That's right.

1311
01:28:39,083 --> 01:28:40,250
It's not over.

1312
01:28:40,333 --> 01:28:43,500
There's still more
glory, money, influence.

1313
01:28:43,583 --> 01:28:46,500
I do not crave such things.

1314
01:28:46,583 --> 01:28:50,458
My desire has
always been the world.

1315
01:28:50,541 --> 01:28:52,708
Of course, what was I thinking?

1316
01:28:52,791 --> 01:28:55,583
It's small, this world.

1317
01:28:55,666 --> 01:28:58,333
It really is quite small.

1318
01:28:58,416 --> 01:29:00,833
Isn't that right, Saya?

1319
01:29:00,916 --> 01:29:03,500
So this thing is
the world to you?

1320
01:29:12,041 --> 01:29:13,541
You let your guard down.

1321
01:29:13,625 --> 01:29:15,708
How sad.

1322
01:29:15,791 --> 01:29:19,041
You and your freak
will die here together.

1323
01:29:19,125 --> 01:29:21,250
I'll make it look as
though she killed you.

1324
01:29:21,333 --> 01:29:24,291
Then, everything will be mine.

1325
01:29:26,416 --> 01:29:28,791
That was terribly
rude, dear cousin.

1326
01:29:30,125 --> 01:29:31,916
How dare you judge!

1327
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,583
You've always looked
down your nose at me.

1328
01:29:34,666 --> 01:29:36,291
And I've hated it!

1329
01:29:46,333 --> 01:29:46,791
No.

1330
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:48,750
No!

1331
01:29:48,833 --> 01:29:51,375
And now, I'll take
back what I loaned to you.

1332
01:29:51,458 --> 01:29:53,375
Because you're ungrateful.

1333
01:29:54,916 --> 01:29:57,541
Fumito.

1334
01:29:57,625 --> 01:29:59,541
Can you feel her blood?

1335
01:30:01,791 --> 01:30:03,750
Watch him, Saya.

1336
01:30:03,833 --> 01:30:06,250
He is the Covenant in action.

1337
01:30:11,625 --> 01:30:15,833
All of that power you've
desired, dear cousin.

1338
01:30:15,916 --> 01:30:18,625
You will now have
the chance to feel.

1339
01:30:22,958 --> 01:30:24,375
Saya.

1340
01:30:24,458 --> 01:30:26,541
For generations, the
heads of the Mogari clan

1341
01:30:26,625 --> 01:30:28,333
have buried something.

1342
01:30:28,416 --> 01:30:29,666
Do you know where
they put the key

1343
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:31,875
to controlling the
Elder Bairns?

1344
01:30:31,958 --> 01:30:34,541
It's hidden within them.

1345
01:30:34,625 --> 01:30:36,375
Your blood has power.

1346
01:30:36,458 --> 01:30:38,750
It is the sole thing that
can destroy the connection

1347
01:30:38,833 --> 01:30:40,750
we have with the Elder Bairns.

1348
01:30:43,333 --> 01:30:45,250
Fumito!

1349
01:30:53,708 --> 01:30:55,291
See, Saya?

1350
01:30:55,375 --> 01:30:57,041
It's as I thought.

1351
01:30:57,125 --> 01:30:59,291
Humans don't become it.

1352
01:30:59,375 --> 01:31:01,625
They are born to it.

1353
01:31:01,708 --> 01:31:03,875
You cannot kill humans.

1354
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:05,166
You are not human.

1355
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:09,083
The only things that
can satiate your hunger

1356
01:31:09,166 --> 01:31:14,500
are the Elder Bairns,
your own kind.

1357
01:31:14,583 --> 01:31:19,125
Did you know the number of
humans is always increasing,

1358
01:31:19,208 --> 01:31:23,000
but the number of Elder Bairns
has dropped dramatically.

1359
01:31:23,083 --> 01:31:26,541
There's hardly even a need
for the Shrovetide anymore.

1360
01:31:27,875 --> 01:31:29,083
Saya.

1361
01:31:29,166 --> 01:31:30,583
How old are you?

1362
01:31:30,666 --> 01:31:32,000
How many years?

1363
01:31:32,083 --> 01:31:34,250
How long will you live?

1364
01:31:34,333 --> 01:31:36,583
Does the Elder Bairns
decline concern you?

1365
01:31:36,666 --> 01:31:38,375
Do you worry at all
how you will survive

1366
01:31:38,458 --> 01:31:40,625
when they finally
become extinct?

1367
01:31:40,708 --> 01:31:42,208
It worries me.

1368
01:31:42,291 --> 01:31:45,250
I tried to create
Elder Bairns for you.

1369
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:49,875
I used your blood,
and The Tower's magic.

1370
01:31:49,958 --> 01:31:51,791
But it didn't work.

1371
01:31:51,875 --> 01:31:54,416
No matter what I did.

1372
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:58,041
They all ended up dying soon
after their transformation.

1373
01:31:58,125 --> 01:31:59,458
I did my best.

1374
01:31:59,541 --> 01:32:02,250
I experimented on
all types of people.

1375
01:32:02,333 --> 01:32:05,041
Practically anyone
I could get my hands on.

1376
01:32:09,125 --> 01:32:11,250
Mana, was it?

1377
01:32:11,333 --> 01:32:14,041
I saw the footage
from the Mogari mansion.

1378
01:32:14,125 --> 01:32:16,333
Her father was a reporter, yes?

1379
01:32:18,541 --> 01:32:20,333
He lasted longer than most...

1380
01:32:22,416 --> 01:32:24,875
But he ran away and died.

1381
01:32:24,958 --> 01:32:27,500
Not too long ago, in fact.

1382
01:32:27,583 --> 01:32:28,708
You knew him.

1383
01:32:31,083 --> 01:32:34,083
He was on the
same train you were.

1384
01:32:34,166 --> 01:32:36,625
Surely, you remember.

1385
01:32:36,708 --> 01:32:39,666
After all, you did kill him.

1386
01:33:02,458 --> 01:33:03,500
What the hell?

1387
01:33:13,583 --> 01:33:15,541
There's the true Saya.

1388
01:33:15,625 --> 01:33:17,500
In all her loveliness.

1389
01:33:17,583 --> 01:33:19,458
A reward for the victor.

1390
01:33:21,541 --> 01:33:24,250
This is the strongest
power that I can summon.

1391
01:33:24,333 --> 01:33:27,000
It's all for you, my, love.

1392
01:33:33,458 --> 01:33:37,500
Back then, all I could
do was run away from you.

1393
01:33:37,583 --> 01:33:39,500
Not now, Saya.

1394
01:34:41,875 --> 01:34:43,583
Is that an Elder Bairn?

1395
01:35:20,916 --> 01:35:23,208
Those eyes.

1396
01:35:23,291 --> 01:35:27,333
They're exactly as they were
when I shot you in the head.

1397
01:35:27,416 --> 01:35:29,541
So beautiful.

1398
01:35:29,625 --> 01:35:32,791
I want you, Saya.

1399
01:35:32,875 --> 01:35:35,708
Fumito!

1400
01:36:40,708 --> 01:36:42,291
Fumito.

1401
01:36:44,291 --> 01:36:47,083
Why did you do this?

1402
01:36:56,083 --> 01:36:58,458
Right here, Saya.

1403
01:36:58,541 --> 01:37:00,666
Fumito?

1404
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:02,000
I told you.

1405
01:37:02,083 --> 01:37:04,541
It isn't easy.

1406
01:37:04,625 --> 01:37:06,791
I tried it on me
before anyone else.

1407
01:37:06,875 --> 01:37:12,250
I wanted to see, if I could
be like my beloved Saya.

1408
01:37:17,291 --> 01:37:19,166
I've been waiting for this.

1409
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:22,333
To finally hold you.

1410
01:37:22,416 --> 01:37:24,541
Forgive me, Saya.

1411
01:37:24,625 --> 01:37:26,583
If I were still human.

1412
01:37:26,666 --> 01:37:33,916
Your curse would be lifted;
you would be free.

1413
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,750
A reward for you, the victor.

1414
01:37:37,833 --> 01:37:39,541
And me?

1415
01:37:39,625 --> 01:37:43,291
I'll receive the
punishment as the loser.

1416
01:37:48,833 --> 01:37:53,708
You were supposed
to dodge that, Saya.

1417
01:37:53,791 --> 01:37:56,666
Now it feels like a reward.

1418
01:38:09,708 --> 01:38:15,375
And in the end, I am alone.

1419
01:38:15,458 --> 01:38:18,375
Always alone.

1420
01:38:33,541 --> 01:38:34,666
We can't see anything.

1421
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:37,541
Cops are all over the place.

1422
01:38:37,625 --> 01:38:38,791
Right now they're only allowing

1423
01:38:38,875 --> 01:38:41,708
the emergency
vehicles to get through.

1424
01:38:41,791 --> 01:38:43,541
Yeah, we're stuck here, too.

1425
01:38:43,625 --> 01:38:46,000
We still can't get
ahold of Mister Mogari.

1426
01:38:47,166 --> 01:38:48,708
Um, excuse me.

1427
01:38:48,791 --> 01:38:50,333
Excuse me.

1428
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:10,666
Most importantly,
I think we can all agree

1429
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:14,500
what the youth really
need for growth is freedom.

1430
01:39:14,583 --> 01:39:18,458
Unnecessarily tying them down
will only invite rebellion.

1431
01:39:18,541 --> 01:39:20,958
Also, we must avoid
any circumstance

1432
01:39:21,041 --> 01:39:23,250
that would create
generational distrust...

1433
01:39:23,333 --> 01:39:25,291
So lady, how was your class?

1434
01:39:25,375 --> 01:39:26,750
Did you have fun?

1435
01:39:26,833 --> 01:39:27,833
Yeah.

1436
01:39:27,916 --> 01:39:30,041
I mean, I stayed the whole time.

1437
01:39:30,125 --> 01:39:32,000
Why don't you join a club?

1438
01:39:32,083 --> 01:39:33,958
Cause I'm not a nerd.

1439
01:39:34,041 --> 01:39:35,875
I have more fun here anyway.

1440
01:39:37,916 --> 01:39:39,208
Mana!

1441
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:42,791
Hey, what's up?

1442
01:39:42,875 --> 01:39:43,875
I have to say,

1443
01:39:43,958 --> 01:39:45,458
I like how much
more relaxed things are

1444
01:39:45,541 --> 01:39:47,083
with this new governor.

1445
01:39:47,166 --> 01:39:48,208
At least the
internet restrictions

1446
01:39:48,291 --> 01:39:49,750
are lifted, you know?

1447
01:39:49,833 --> 01:39:51,541
The Youth Protection
Act is gone;

1448
01:39:51,625 --> 01:39:53,625
that's the most important thing.

1449
01:39:53,708 --> 01:39:56,000
Compared to back then,
this is heaven.

1450
01:39:59,166 --> 01:40:00,666
Almost heaven.

1451
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:03,208
I wish Mister Mogari
was still here.

1452
01:40:04,625 --> 01:40:07,000
Cisnet was absorbed
by another company.

1453
01:40:07,083 --> 01:40:10,458
So, Seventh Heaven's executives
have all been replaced.

1454
01:40:10,541 --> 01:40:14,000
Even Fumito Nanahara
vanished from public life.

1455
01:40:14,083 --> 01:40:16,041
There's no telling
where Mister Mogari went,

1456
01:40:16,125 --> 01:40:18,250
but surely he's fine.

1457
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,416
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

1458
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:22,791
This got dark.

1459
01:40:22,875 --> 01:40:24,000
Sorry.

1460
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,375
It's okay.

1461
01:40:27,458 --> 01:40:28,708
You know, thinking about it,

1462
01:40:28,791 --> 01:40:30,541
it's been like a
year and a half.

1463
01:40:30,625 --> 01:40:31,750
It's crazy.

1464
01:40:33,291 --> 01:40:34,833
I wonder.

1465
01:40:34,916 --> 01:40:36,083
Wonder what?

1466
01:40:36,166 --> 01:40:38,666
You do realize this is
all your fault, Matsuo!

1467
01:40:38,750 --> 01:40:40,333
How do you figure that?

1468
01:40:40,416 --> 01:40:41,625
You are such a brat!

1469
01:40:41,708 --> 01:40:43,541
Am not!

1470
01:40:43,625 --> 01:40:45,208
There they go again.

1471
01:40:46,666 --> 01:40:47,625
You think they'll get any better

1472
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:49,625
when they get
married next month?

1473
01:40:49,708 --> 01:40:51,458
Nah, they'll never change.

1474
01:40:51,541 --> 01:40:53,250
I think that's why they work.

1475
01:40:53,333 --> 01:40:54,833
Hey, knock it off!

1476
01:40:54,916 --> 01:40:57,208
Can you two quit
fighting for once?

1477
01:40:57,291 --> 01:40:58,083
Okay.

1478
01:40:58,166 --> 01:40:59,583
Lucky for you, you're pretty.

1479
01:40:59,666 --> 01:41:01,125
Lucky for what?

1480
01:41:01,208 --> 01:41:02,625

1483
01:41:05,125 --> 01:41:10,958
