WEBVTT

00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:33.082
In some places, you can tell what time of
year it is by which flowers are in bloom.

00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:38.747
In Yokohama, it's which boats
you see passing through the harbor.

00:00:42.287 --> 00:00:47.550
Only, there are more and more of them now
since Tokyo was awarded the '64 Summer Olympics.

00:00:50.352 --> 00:00:53.589
We have a great view of the
boats from my house on Poppy Hill.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.691
Actually, it's my grandmother's house.

00:01:05.097 --> 00:01:07.777
But with my father gone and my mother studying in America,

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.363
it's my job to cook and do laundry for our boarders

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:14.340
and look after my little brother and sister.

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:22.906
Ever since the wars, it seems the whole country is
eager to get rid of the old and make way for the new.

00:01:24.363 --> 00:01:27.114
But some of us aren't so ready to let go of the past, and

00:01:28.192 --> 00:01:31.122
sometimes the past is not ready let go of us either.

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:17.839
Good morning, Umi!

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:19.174
Good morning, Miss Aori.

00:03:19.396 --> 00:03:20.780
Is Sora up yet?

00:03:20.805 --> 00:03:22.461
Hmm, wouldn't that be a miracle?

00:03:22.891 --> 00:03:23.883
Good morning.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.578
Good morning, Miki.

00:03:24.594 --> 00:03:25.320
Morning.

00:03:26.023 --> 00:03:26.758
Ah.

00:03:27.797 --> 00:03:30.125
So, late night at the hospital again, Miki?

00:03:30.141 --> 00:03:30.695
Yep.

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:32.602
And another one tonight.

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:35.938
If you'd like, I can save dinner for you.

00:03:36.171 --> 00:03:37.725
Oh, you're a saint.

00:03:38.078 --> 00:03:39.789
What would we do without Umi?

00:03:40.594 --> 00:03:41.773
What will I do without...

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:42.468
Hey, sis.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.062
I got another hole in my sock.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.008
Just leave it beside the sewing machine.

00:03:46.194 --> 00:03:47.913
That boy has holes in his head.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.023
Hey, I heard that.

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:50.514
Two eggs, please.

00:03:50.538 --> 00:03:51.594
One is enough for you.

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.055
Well, I've got sports today, so pack a big lunch.

00:03:55.086 --> 00:03:56.836
Is there a hole in your stomach too?

00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:57.642
Ha ha.

00:03:58.246 --> 00:03:58.906
Here, Riku.

00:03:58.922 --> 00:03:59.722
Have my eggs.

00:03:59.754 --> 00:04:00.213
Yes!

00:04:00.625 --> 00:04:01.461
Thank you.

00:04:01.531 --> 00:04:03.051
You should take it, Miki.

00:04:03.067 --> 00:04:04.297
You need it more than him.

00:04:04.906 --> 00:04:06.539
Now, which one of you is the doctor?

00:04:06.578 --> 00:04:09.148
At least someone cares about my hunger pains.

00:04:09.867 --> 00:04:10.551
Hey!

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.258
Easy on the soy sauce.

00:04:12.672 --> 00:04:14.023
But I like it this way.

00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:16.453
Ooh, pass me the soy!

00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:20.454
Breakfast is ready, Sachiko!

00:04:20.695 --> 00:04:22.367
Yeah, I'll be right there.

00:04:22.756 --> 00:04:23.889
Good morning grandma.

00:04:24.904 --> 00:04:25.670
Good morning.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.919
Riku, why don't you and Umi share your mother's plate?

00:04:34.944 --> 00:04:35.608
Thank you.

00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:36.960
Grandmother.

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:38.359
Would you like me to make you some tea?

00:04:38.836 --> 00:04:39.796
Yes, Umi.

00:04:39.796 --> 00:04:40.865
That would be lovely.

00:04:42.123 --> 00:04:43.420
Good morning, Sachiko.

00:04:43.905 --> 00:04:45.426
I bid you all good morning.

00:04:45.442 --> 00:04:46.256
Good morning.

00:04:49.978 --> 00:04:50.962
Thank you, dear.

00:04:57.188 --> 00:04:58.472
Please begin, everyone.

00:04:59.363 --> 00:05:00.809
I gratefully receive.

00:05:04.612 --> 00:05:05.324
You're late.

00:05:05.973 --> 00:05:07.902
I couldn't get my hair to look right.

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:11.264
It looks like hair is supposed to look.

00:05:14.628 --> 00:05:15.769
I'm starving.

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:17.902
Evening rounds again, Miki?

00:05:18.165 --> 00:05:18.684
Yes.

00:05:18.768 --> 00:05:20.214
I don't know how you keep up this pace.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.925
Can I have your dinner?

00:06:18.963 --> 00:06:20.247
See you tomorrow, Umi!

00:06:20.605 --> 00:06:21.327
Bye Miki!

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.692
Good morning.

00:06:46.708 --> 00:06:47.655
Morning, Umi.

00:06:49.012 --> 00:06:50.325
Do you want a ride, Umi?

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:51.511
No, thank you.

00:06:51.527 --> 00:06:51.902
I'll walk.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.153
Ah, to be young.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.146
Tomoko, could you finish the laundry for me?

00:06:56.395 --> 00:06:57.224
Of course.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.091
I'd be happy to.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:59.232
Thank you.

00:07:12.156 --> 00:07:13.080
Hey, wait up!

00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:18.579
Hi.

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:19.246
Morning.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.041
You saw it already?

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.720
Umi, over here!

00:07:23.736 --> 00:07:24.627
Come see this.

00:07:24.643 --> 00:07:25.307
What is it?

00:07:25.447 --> 00:07:27.244
Oh, just an article about you.

00:07:27.505 --> 00:07:28.846
It must be about you.

00:07:28.947 --> 00:07:30.721
Who else raises flags every morning?

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:32.541
Fair girl.

00:07:32.697 --> 00:07:34.705
Why do you send your thoughts to the sky?

00:07:34.963 --> 00:07:37.705
The winds carries them aloft to mingle with the crows.

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:40.830
Trimmed with blue, your flags fly again today.

00:07:40.846 --> 00:07:43.947
Aw, looks like someone's getting your messages.

00:07:44.313 --> 00:07:44.815
Mm-hm.

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.979
I doubt it.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.111
Someone at this school getting
those messages just doesn't calculate.

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:51.605
Math Club freak!

00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:55.713
He's one of those snobby guys that
lives at that dirty old club house.

00:07:58.369 --> 00:07:59.193
All rise!

00:08:01.498 --> 00:08:02.630
There you are.

00:08:02.646 --> 00:08:03.654
Sorry I'm late.

00:08:06.427 --> 00:08:07.279
I'm starving.

00:08:07.295 --> 00:08:08.130
Saved you a seat.

00:08:09.201 --> 00:08:11.396
Who ordered the curry noodles?

00:08:11.412 --> 00:08:12.795
So, what did he say?

00:08:13.091 --> 00:08:13.888
Nobuko!

00:08:14.239 --> 00:08:15.172
Over here.

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:17.102
Thanks for waiting.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.437
Curry udon again?

00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:20.341
Oh, and you're one to talk.

00:08:20.475 --> 00:08:21.279
Let me guess.

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:22.794
Tuna sandwiches again?

00:08:23.123 --> 00:08:23.853
Who cares?

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:24.462
I like them.

00:08:24.966 --> 00:08:27.107
Umi, your lunches always look so good.

00:08:27.273 --> 00:08:28.498
It's not difficult.

00:08:28.691 --> 00:08:30.276
You should try making your own sometime.

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:31.030
It'll never happen.

00:08:31.357 --> 00:08:32.349
I don't have the time.

00:08:34.229 --> 00:08:35.481
Hey!

00:08:36.934 --> 00:08:38.547
Great, now what?

00:08:51.151 --> 00:08:52.311
And up.

00:08:54.008 --> 00:08:57.261
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two.

00:09:01.287 --> 00:09:01.869
Men!

00:09:02.038 --> 00:09:03.038
It's time.

00:09:04.154 --> 00:09:06.365
Save our building!

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.911
OK, batter up.

00:09:46.923 --> 00:09:48.806
Smile for the camera, lovebirds!

00:09:48.822 --> 00:09:49.841
Give us a smile.

00:09:54.559 --> 00:09:56.004
That was so cool.

00:09:57.278 --> 00:09:58.536
Umi, are you OK?

00:09:59.615 --> 00:10:00.371
So stupid.

00:10:06.918 --> 00:10:07.894
I'm home!

00:10:08.499 --> 00:10:09.387
Welcome back.

00:10:09.785 --> 00:10:11.394
Oh, thank you Tomoko.

00:10:11.815 --> 00:10:12.676
My pleasure.

00:10:16.238 --> 00:10:16.871
There.

00:10:16.926 --> 00:10:17.683
All finished.

00:10:18.387 --> 00:10:20.066
The mackerel was on sale today.

00:10:20.551 --> 00:10:22.105
Mm, mackerel, that's good.

00:10:22.824 --> 00:10:23.738
Maybe I'll fry it.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.460
I almost forgot, I have a meeting with grandmother.

00:10:33.631 --> 00:10:34.241
Grandmother?

00:10:35.151 --> 00:10:36.116
It's me, Umi.

00:10:36.488 --> 00:10:37.256
Come in.

00:10:50.349 --> 00:10:51.545
Very impressive.

00:10:51.709 --> 00:10:53.553
You're managing the house beautifully.

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:58.779
Only because you're paying to Tomoko's
wages, which is a tremendous help.

00:10:59.307 --> 00:11:00.271
Nonsense.

00:11:00.545 --> 00:11:04.303
I would have hired her anyway,
even if we hadn't taken in boarders.

00:11:05.139 --> 00:11:06.201
Tell me, my child.

00:11:06.474 --> 00:11:07.881
Is this too much work for you?

00:11:10.227 --> 00:11:11.381
I worry about you.

00:11:12.939 --> 00:11:13.474
But why?

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.935
I promise I'm not letting it get in the way of my studies.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:16.889
Umi.

00:11:18.903 --> 00:11:22.842
Believe me, I know how much you miss your father.

00:11:23.199 --> 00:11:27.271
But it makes me sad watching you
every morning raising those flags.

00:11:28.329 --> 00:11:30.014
I hope you find someone.

00:11:30.247 --> 00:11:33.303
Then maybe you won't need to raise those flags anymore.

00:11:35.211 --> 00:11:36.334
I'm sorry to interrupt.

00:11:36.712 --> 00:11:37.394
Come in.

00:11:39.607 --> 00:11:41.256
I'm finished for the day, ma'am.

00:11:42.134 --> 00:11:43.045
Thank you, Tomoko.

00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:47.521
Excuse me, grandmother.

00:11:48.873 --> 00:11:49.896
I should get dinner going.

00:12:57.196 --> 00:12:58.485
It was very exciting.

00:12:58.891 --> 00:13:03.110
In fact, it created such a stir that some of
the girls are talking about starting a fan club.

00:13:03.379 --> 00:13:04.235
What?

00:13:04.251 --> 00:13:05.235
OK, so what's his name?

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.219
Shun Kazama, and he is a real live wire.

00:13:08.258 --> 00:13:09.680
So he's the electrician's son?

00:13:10.172 --> 00:13:10.797
What?

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:42.189
Fair girl, why do you send your thoughts to the sky?

00:13:57.962 --> 00:14:03.823
Thus the Principality of Wallachia was
hemmed in by the Ottoman Turks and Russia,

00:14:03.839 --> 00:14:06.576
and its territory was coveted by both.

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:20.413
Hey Umi.

00:14:20.429 --> 00:14:21.914
Sora, what's going on?

00:14:24.601 --> 00:14:26.539
I bought this for 30 yen.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.484
Wow, that's a waste of money.

00:14:31.609 --> 00:14:32.859
I don't care what you say.

00:14:33.023 --> 00:14:35.141
I think he's cute, and I want to get his autograph.

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:37.101
Please come with me to the Latin Quarter Clubhouse,

00:14:37.101 --> 00:14:39.617
so that way when I meet him, he doesn't think I'm weird.

00:14:39.633 --> 00:14:40.634
Are you crazy?

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:42.054
I don't want to go to that old place.

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:42.906
But I'm desperate.

00:14:42.922 --> 00:14:43.664
Well, I'm not.

00:14:44.656 --> 00:14:47.062
I know you're not, but you'll do it for me, won't you?

00:14:48.156 --> 00:14:49.172
Come on, say yes.

00:14:49.483 --> 00:14:49.765
Yes.

00:14:49.938 --> 00:14:50.396
Yes?

00:14:54.201 --> 00:14:54.601
Wow.

00:14:55.726 --> 00:14:58.069
They really like signs.

00:14:59.228 --> 00:15:00.979
Save the Latin Quarter.

00:15:02.585 --> 00:15:05.960
Don't extinguish the flame of culture?

00:15:08.827 --> 00:15:09.476
Ready?

00:15:09.842 --> 00:15:10.421
Mm-hm.

00:15:15.874 --> 00:15:17.366
Did you see those spots?

00:15:17.391 --> 00:15:18.212
Um, excuse me.

00:15:18.235 --> 00:15:18.696
Gentlemen?

00:15:19.118 --> 00:15:20.743
I've never seen them so distinct.

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:23.329
This might be more awesome than the solar flares of 1960.

00:15:23.368 --> 00:15:24.954
Don't even joke about that.

00:15:25.016 --> 00:15:26.157
I said excuse me.

00:15:26.257 --> 00:15:27.370
What did you say?

00:15:27.568 --> 00:15:30.657
I'm sorry to interrupt, but we're
looking for the school newspaper office.

00:15:30.743 --> 00:15:33.290
Uh, third floor, same room as the Archeology Club.

00:15:33.727 --> 00:15:34.360
Thank you.

00:15:34.954 --> 00:15:35.994
What are girls doing here?

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:36.938
I have no idea.

00:15:36.954 --> 00:15:37.774
Do you think they liked us?

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.873
Well, I love what they've done with the place.

00:15:55.763 --> 00:15:56.537
Wait.

00:16:01.724 --> 00:16:02.364
Whoa.

00:16:15.014 --> 00:16:16.022
Ahoy.

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:19.116
Excuse me, where's the Archaeology Club?

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:20.596
Upstairs.

00:16:20.621 --> 00:16:23.015
Listen for the sounds of smug portentousness.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.022
OK, thank you.

00:16:24.413 --> 00:16:25.054
Ready?

00:16:25.155 --> 00:16:26.001
Mm-hm.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.650
Ah, at last.

00:16:37.846 --> 00:16:41.361
Inquiring minds seeking answers to life's great mysteries.

00:16:41.377 --> 00:16:41.830
Huh?

00:16:41.931 --> 00:16:48.564
I will personally offer you my stewardship and
share with you my passion for the philosophical arts.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:52.892
That's a very kind offer, but we're
actually headed for the. Archaeology Club.

00:16:53.028 --> 00:16:54.238
Fine, as you wish.

00:16:54.265 --> 00:16:56.833
But when you find yourself seeking the meaning of life,

00:16:57.408 --> 00:16:58.838
I'll be right here to enlighten you.

00:17:02.791 --> 00:17:05.713
Chemistry Club, you ruined our contemplation!

00:17:06.166 --> 00:17:06.667
Oh well.

00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:07.972
You're welcome, ladies.

00:17:08.144 --> 00:17:09.877
That guy'll talk your ear off.

00:17:09.908 --> 00:17:10.845
Hey, that's enough.

00:17:11.228 --> 00:17:13.525
Show some respect you second-rate alchemists.

00:17:13.541 --> 00:17:14.189
Here's a thought.

00:17:14.228 --> 00:17:17.476
Try experimenting with something that actually exists!

00:17:17.851 --> 00:17:22.421
Obtain new transparent energy from the
clouds, from the light, from the storms!

00:17:22.683 --> 00:17:26.046
And suggest to man and the
universe the shapes they are to take.

00:17:26.062 --> 00:17:29.694
Copernicus of the new age,
set this galaxy free from the...

00:17:30.181 --> 00:17:32.523
CQ, this is O-N-4-FMKK.

00:17:32.562 --> 00:17:33.093
Thanks, O-N.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.968
We are high school students from Japan!

00:17:51.299 --> 00:17:52.244
Watch your step.

00:17:53.139 --> 00:17:53.861
Mm-hm.

00:18:02.431 --> 00:18:02.927
That's it.

00:18:04.296 --> 00:18:04.850
Mm-hm.

00:18:06.852 --> 00:18:08.354
Oh, hi Umi.

00:18:08.354 --> 00:18:09.396
Yamazaki.

00:18:10.064 --> 00:18:12.818
Hey, couple of potential groupies here to see you.

00:18:13.233 --> 00:18:14.013
Ciao.

00:18:18.552 --> 00:18:20.138
Welcome to the Lit Club.

00:18:20.657 --> 00:18:22.302
Or Archeology Club.

00:18:22.747 --> 00:18:26.771
Or maybe you're the two who actually
read that failed weekly rag we publish.

00:18:26.826 --> 00:18:28.207
Knock it off, Mizunuma.

00:18:28.232 --> 00:18:30.647
Bring them in and close the door.

00:18:32.219 --> 00:18:36.395
The crux of the matter is, how
can we make archaeology cool again?

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.092
We can't.

00:18:41.377 --> 00:18:42.322
Uh, uh.

00:18:42.846 --> 00:18:43.399
Oh.

00:18:45.307 --> 00:18:47.059
Can you please give me your autograph?

00:18:47.075 --> 00:18:47.487
Huh?

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:49.909
Go ahead, Elvis.

00:18:50.396 --> 00:18:50.987
Hm.

00:19:00.214 --> 00:19:00.714
Here.

00:19:00.739 --> 00:19:01.240
Thank you.

00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:02.580
Thank you so much!

00:19:02.706 --> 00:19:03.578
How's your hand?

00:19:04.576 --> 00:19:04.993
This?

00:19:05.125 --> 00:19:06.396
This isn't from the fall.

00:19:06.421 --> 00:19:08.119
I cut myself shaving.

00:19:08.156 --> 00:19:09.337
He shaves.

00:19:09.832 --> 00:19:10.399
Shaving?

00:19:11.445 --> 00:19:14.904
Hey, how'd you like to help
Mr. Whiskers here cut some stencils?

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:15.688
Huh?

00:19:16.156 --> 00:19:20.305
Because we're pretty busy with the campaign to
keep the Latin Quarter from getting demolished.

00:19:20.469 --> 00:19:21.664
You're the little sister, right?

00:19:21.937 --> 00:19:22.518
Yes.

00:19:22.636 --> 00:19:23.672
I'm Sora Matsuzaki.

00:19:24.328 --> 00:19:27.433
But if you need help with
stencils, Umi has better handwriting.

00:19:27.433 --> 00:19:28.058
Right, Umi?

00:19:28.058 --> 00:19:30.023
What are you talking about, Sora?

00:19:30.046 --> 00:19:30.767
I don't have time...

00:19:30.791 --> 00:19:35.955
Look, if you're a second year student, you
take physics, and your teacher is old man Suzuki.

00:19:37.651 --> 00:19:38.650
Mr. Suzuki.

00:19:39.027 --> 00:19:44.814
Right, well, Mizunuma uses these old tests to
make up a mock test for the upcoming physics exam.

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:45.650
That's right.

00:19:45.986 --> 00:19:48.775
But it's not really cheating
if they're only half accurate.

00:19:51.072 --> 00:19:52.564
Shun, see you at 6:007?

00:19:52.696 --> 00:19:53.431
Right.

00:19:53.517 --> 00:19:55.455
Miss Sora, please come with me.

00:19:56.036 --> 00:19:56.681
OK.

00:20:00.841 --> 00:20:06.658
With your permission, I will escort you to the
door, lest you be ambushed by our resident philosopher.

00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:08.348
Permission granted.

00:20:13.937 --> 00:20:15.485
Hm.

00:20:20.099 --> 00:20:20.478
Hm?

00:20:27.951 --> 00:20:29.413
From here to the end.

00:20:29.429 --> 00:20:29.866
Mm-hm.

00:20:43.639 --> 00:20:45.288
And I say we are cool.

00:20:45.537 --> 00:20:49.225
We have to get people interested
in the Paleolithic Period.

00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:50.428
To the library!

00:21:34.129 --> 00:21:35.245
Meeting's starting, Shun.

00:21:35.769 --> 00:21:37.489
Oh, you might wanna join us, Umi.

00:21:37.777 --> 00:21:40.128
If you like a room full of guys screaming at each other.

00:21:40.433 --> 00:21:41.441
Is it that late?

00:21:41.996 --> 00:21:42.401
I'm sorry.

00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:43.214
I have to go.

00:21:43.472 --> 00:21:44.269
It's OK.

00:21:44.653 --> 00:21:45.542
You were a big help.

00:21:47.197 --> 00:21:48.583
Meeting time!

00:21:48.907 --> 00:21:52.286
All club members to the first floor!

00:21:52.313 --> 00:21:54.579
Meeting time!

00:21:56.951 --> 00:21:58.359
Check it out, X chromosome.

00:22:18.385 --> 00:22:19.180
I'm home!

00:22:48.176 --> 00:22:49.613
Wow, starting kind of late.

00:22:49.675 --> 00:22:50.718
Yes, I know.

00:22:50.844 --> 00:22:52.512
And I still need to cut some vegetables.

00:22:52.537 --> 00:22:53.357
Can you help me out?

00:22:53.544 --> 00:22:54.608
I hope so.

00:23:13.066 --> 00:23:14.635
Grandmother, I'm home.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.021
You're running a bit late, Umi.

00:23:16.037 --> 00:23:19.724
Riku, we're all out of pork, and I need you
to run down to the butcher shop and get some.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.334
Uh, no?

00:23:23.293 --> 00:23:23.888
Sora”?

00:23:24.373 --> 00:23:27.560
But the program just started and this is my favorite part.

00:23:28.298 --> 00:23:29.935
But didn't Tomoko buy you some?

00:23:31.051 --> 00:23:32.543
I used it all for the lunches.

00:23:39.001 --> 00:23:41.577
Sachiko, start the rice in ten minutes, OK?

00:23:41.705 --> 00:23:45.190
Rice, and chopping, and rice.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:59.487
Going shopping?

00:23:59.996 --> 00:24:00.659
Sort of.

00:24:03.065 --> 00:24:03.674
Hop on.

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:05.416
I'll give you a ride to the bottom of the hill.

00:24:06.213 --> 00:24:07.573
Ah, don't worry about this.

00:24:07.838 --> 00:24:09.487
I can break just fine with three fingers.

00:24:09.923 --> 00:24:10.627
What do you say?

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.749
I thought you were at your meeting.

00:24:28.108 --> 00:24:29.858
Yeah, I was, but I left.

00:24:30.527 --> 00:24:32.764
I've got to get back home before my curfew.

00:24:35.202 --> 00:24:37.617
Did you finish printing the midterm mock test?

00:24:37.642 --> 00:24:38.977
Not even close.

00:24:39.161 --> 00:24:41.788
I'll get in early tomorrow and do it before school starts.

00:24:45.678 --> 00:24:48.007
Shun, do you mind if I ask you a question?

00:24:48.587 --> 00:24:49.069
Hm?

00:24:50.547 --> 00:24:52.466
About the poem in the pa...

00:24:52.833 --> 00:24:53.562
Hang on!

00:25:00.714 --> 00:25:01.402
You were saying?

00:25:02.159 --> 00:25:03.901
Hm, nothing.

00:25:16.573 --> 00:25:17.335
Thank you, Shun.

00:25:19.577 --> 00:25:20.452
Hi Mr. Ishii.

00:25:20.476 --> 00:25:22.046
I need some sliced pork, please.

00:25:22.468 --> 00:25:23.280
Hi Umi.

00:25:23.439 --> 00:25:24.538
Two to go, please.

00:25:25.123 --> 00:25:27.374
Because it's for you, there's a little extra.

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:28.312
You're very kind.

00:25:31.097 --> 00:25:31.853
Here you are.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:32.773
Have a good evening.

00:25:33.616 --> 00:25:34.444
Next in line.

00:25:34.841 --> 00:25:35.499
Thanks for waiting.

00:25:36.187 --> 00:25:36.836
Mm.

00:25:36.852 --> 00:25:37.609
Have one.

00:25:40.706 --> 00:25:42.382
Won't make it on an empty stomach.

00:25:43.484 --> 00:25:44.530
Where do you live?

00:25:45.305 --> 00:25:45.889
Downtown.

00:25:45.936 --> 00:25:46.311
Oh.

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:47.687
That's pretty far.

00:25:47.703 --> 00:25:48.359
Mm-hm.

00:25:51.149 --> 00:25:52.057
Gotta go.

00:25:54.157 --> 00:25:55.314
Thanks for the ride.

00:25:55.748 --> 00:25:56.549
You're welcome!

00:26:06.823 --> 00:26:08.111
This is nice.

00:26:28.929 --> 00:26:31.424
Sachiko, can I come in?

00:26:33.565 --> 00:26:34.830
Are you not feeling well?

00:26:39.666 --> 00:26:41.283
You'd better go ahead without me.

00:26:42.174 --> 00:26:43.268
Wake up, Sachiko.

00:26:56.282 --> 00:26:56.770
Whoa.

00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:58.452
I know.

00:27:07.612 --> 00:27:08.318
Ugh.

00:27:09.018 --> 00:27:11.112
The colors are wrong when I paint at night.

00:27:12.307 --> 00:27:13.270
It's beautiful.

00:27:15.323 --> 00:27:16.268
What's this?

00:27:17.311 --> 00:27:20.041
That's a boat I often see passing by.

00:27:20.657 --> 00:27:24.463
This might sound crazy, but I
think it's answering your flags.

00:27:25.327 --> 00:27:26.268
Oh, yeah.

00:27:26.507 --> 00:27:28.106
You can't see it from the garden.

00:27:30.206 --> 00:27:32.229
Answering my flags?

00:27:40.733 --> 00:27:41.764
What day is it?

00:28:03.873 --> 00:28:04.624
Good morning.

00:28:04.658 --> 00:28:05.347
Morning, Shun.

00:28:05.363 --> 00:28:06.152
Did you finish?

00:28:06.313 --> 00:28:07.371
All printed up.

00:28:07.387 --> 00:28:08.746
Would you like to see your handiwork?

00:28:09.722 --> 00:28:10.582
Look at that.

00:28:12.332 --> 00:28:13.488
Shun, I, uh...

00:28:18.546 --> 00:28:21.136
There was something printed in
the paper I wanted to ask you about.

00:28:21.591 --> 00:28:22.277
OK.

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:25.800
Um, now might not be the best time.

00:28:25.816 --> 00:28:27.410
Maybe just after school?

00:28:27.597 --> 00:28:31.925
Yeah, I was going to ask you to do some more
stencils, so maybe we can meet at the clubhouse?

00:28:31.997 --> 00:28:32.800
That works.

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:36.539
It will have to be tomorrow, though,
because there's a big debate today.

00:28:36.564 --> 00:28:37.273
Do you want to come?

00:28:37.273 --> 00:28:40.019
I'd love to, but I have too much I have to get done.

00:28:41.194 --> 00:28:41.736
Oh!

00:28:42.089 --> 00:28:42.871
But I'll try.

00:28:42.988 --> 00:28:43.777
Sure, OK.

00:28:50.396 --> 00:28:51.403
Umi, wait up!

00:28:51.745 --> 00:28:53.014
You want to get some ice cream?

00:28:53.039 --> 00:28:54.551
I thought you had practice.

00:28:54.567 --> 00:28:57.051
It was canceled because of that stupid debate.

00:28:57.489 --> 00:28:58.293
I can't go to.

00:28:58.406 --> 00:29:00.840
Tomoko's off today, and I really should get home early.

00:29:01.629 --> 00:29:05.082
This way for the historic debate,
future of the Latin Quarter to be decided!

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:09.739
All right, good!

00:29:09.764 --> 00:29:10.462
Stop there.

00:29:13.643 --> 00:29:14.894
This is going to get rough.

00:29:19.678 --> 00:29:20.242
Umi.

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:21.776
You heading home?

00:29:21.955 --> 00:29:23.564
Because I got some really nice flounder.

00:29:23.878 --> 00:29:24.838
Um, sure.

00:29:24.863 --> 00:29:25.655
I'll take some.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.495
Coming right up.

00:29:27.125 --> 00:29:28.622
Hey, is your mom back from America?

00:29:29.017 --> 00:29:29.759
Not yet.

00:29:30.618 --> 00:29:32.245
I'll, uh, come back for the fish later.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:33.690
Wha... how much later?

00:29:38.836 --> 00:29:42.344
Construct a new state of the
art student center in its place!

00:29:42.689 --> 00:29:45.191
Japan is a nation in transition!

00:29:45.216 --> 00:29:49.179
We have suffered the scars of war,
and we have emerged a stronger people!

00:29:49.204 --> 00:29:50.655
A peaceful people!

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.182
A modern people!

00:29:56.436 --> 00:29:59.814
We cannot stand in the way of progress.

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:04.687
The Tokyo Olympics will showcase our new
democracy as a bright beacon to guide the world...

00:30:04.703 --> 00:30:05.577
Oh, Umi.

00:30:05.593 --> 00:30:06.039
...into a promising new future!

00:30:06.055 --> 00:30:07.351
What are they yelling about?

00:30:07.694 --> 00:30:08.577
I have no idea.

00:30:08.593 --> 00:30:11.359
But how can we lead into the
future if we still cling to the past?

00:30:11.398 --> 00:30:16.020
It is time we throw these old
buildings out as relics of a bygone era!

00:30:16.101 --> 00:30:21.695
Our polls say 80% of you want the Latin Quarter torn down!

00:30:26.132 --> 00:30:28.651
Your ideas of democracy make me laugh.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.805
We've come here to debate; you've
already made up our minds for us.

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:34.157
Sit back down, or I'll have you thrown out!

00:30:34.182 --> 00:30:36.851
You're just like the old men who run this country!

00:30:36.938 --> 00:30:39.102
Dumb and enamored with the new!

00:30:40.547 --> 00:30:41.831
I'm sick of that building!

00:30:41.847 --> 00:30:43.143
It's time to tear it down!

00:30:43.197 --> 00:30:44.657
It's about the Olympics!

00:30:45.026 --> 00:30:45.713
Yeah!

00:30:45.893 --> 00:30:46.954
Let him speak!

00:30:56.294 --> 00:30:56.896
Listen!

00:30:57.163 --> 00:31:00.255
If you're so hell-bent on demolition,
demolish your shortsighted thinking!

00:31:00.271 --> 00:31:01.042
That's enough!

00:31:01.042 --> 00:31:01.793
Sit down!

00:31:01.793 --> 00:31:05.864
You cannot move into the future
without first knowing the past!

00:31:05.948 --> 00:31:10.325
Destroy everything old and you dishonor
those who lived and died before us.

00:31:10.552 --> 00:31:14.216
The Olympics has the whole country
thinking all that glitters is gold.

00:31:14.536 --> 00:31:15.707
Well, I say it's not!

00:31:15.849 --> 00:31:20.186
And just because the majority disagrees,
doesn't mean we're going down without a fight!

00:31:20.211 --> 00:31:21.366
Anarchists!

00:31:21.521 --> 00:31:22.286
Charge!

00:31:23.747 --> 00:31:24.966
<i>Here they come!</i>

00:31:25.984 --> 00:31:26.794
Stand!

00:31:26.985 --> 00:31:28.989
Stand fast, men!

00:31:30.488 --> 00:31:31.419
We're not history!

00:31:31.435 --> 00:31:32.560
You're history!

00:31:36.923 --> 00:31:38.399
Very graceful!

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.704
You should start attacking!

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:58.875
I still remember that day long ago.

00:31:59.559 --> 00:32:06.454
You looked away, but I saw you crying for me.

00:32:07.258 --> 00:32:12.488
Sayonara, you said, my love.

00:32:13.011 --> 00:32:22.222
When morning came, you left an
ivory flower, my lone memory of you.

00:32:23.416 --> 00:32:33.863
I walk alone, still hoping to find you,
the flower that blooms inside of my heart.

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:44.720
I walk alone, still hoping to find you,
the flower that blooms inside of my heart.

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:49.723
Umi!

00:32:50.235 --> 00:32:51.285
So what did you think?

00:32:51.819 --> 00:32:53.457
I think it was amazing.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.028
You're all so passionate.

00:32:55.442 --> 00:32:57.408
Yeah, debates are always like that.

00:32:57.433 --> 00:33:00.264
I hate that everyone thinks
the clubhouse is just an eyesore.

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:02.207
They don't care what's going on inside.

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:03.895
You really think so?

00:33:17.409 --> 00:33:18.339
Hey, I know.

00:33:18.471 --> 00:33:20.277
Why don't you all just clean the place up?

00:33:20.473 --> 00:33:21.081
Huh?

00:33:21.683 --> 00:33:24.560
It's a great old building, but
no one can see it through the dust.

00:33:24.585 --> 00:33:25.294
So clean it up.

00:33:25.378 --> 00:33:26.646
Make it look like new again.

00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:27.473
Make it cool.

00:33:27.636 --> 00:33:29.050
Maybe invite a few girls.

00:33:29.933 --> 00:33:31.308
Then the boys will like it, too.

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.777
You're probably right.

00:33:33.214 --> 00:33:36.933
I would just have to convince everyone the
dust isn't an important part of its history.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.972
The physics midterm mock test was a huge success.

00:33:40.238 --> 00:33:42.909
I think it won you guys more than a few admirers.

00:33:43.417 --> 00:33:44.448
Me included.

00:33:50.072 --> 00:33:50.705
OK.

00:33:50.884 --> 00:33:53.767
Well, um, here are the stencils.

00:33:54.007 --> 00:33:54.775
Thanks again.

00:33:56.182 --> 00:33:56.892
Bye, Shun.

00:33:57.077 --> 00:33:57.845
Bye, Umi.

00:34:02.767 --> 00:34:04.293
And thanks for the advice!

00:34:15.465 --> 00:34:16.620
Forgot about the fish.

00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:22.090
It was such a big fight, and they
were going to be in so much trouble.

00:34:22.106 --> 00:34:26.086
But Mizunuma got them all to start
singing, and the teachers were totally fooled!

00:34:30.293 --> 00:34:31.895
Sounds like nothing's changed.

00:34:32.337 --> 00:34:34.567
When I was there, that stuff happened all the time.

00:34:34.881 --> 00:34:38.176
Your president, Mizunuma, is the
little brother of a classmate of mine.

00:34:38.192 --> 00:34:38.801
Really?

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:41.204
Was his brother also a genius?

00:34:41.419 --> 00:34:42.481
His sister.

00:34:42.789 --> 00:34:44.395
She's an astrophysicist.

00:34:44.572 --> 00:34:45.406
Wow!

00:34:45.516 --> 00:34:46.841
Here you go, doctor.

00:34:47.112 --> 00:34:48.453
From my secret stash.

00:34:48.478 --> 00:34:49.645
Is that whiskey?

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:51.725
As a matter of fact, it is.

00:34:51.794 --> 00:34:52.887
Oh, glasses.

00:34:52.903 --> 00:34:53.669
Can I have some?

00:34:53.685 --> 00:34:54.817
Sora, you're too young.

00:34:55.385 --> 00:34:56.303
Hey.

00:34:56.319 --> 00:34:59.794
How about we invite some of the guys
from school to my going away party?

00:35:00.265 --> 00:35:02.309
What guys?

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:04.598
The really cute ones.

00:35:06.662 --> 00:35:07.914
Really cute what?

00:35:29.561 --> 00:35:30.237
Hey, Umi.

00:35:33.981 --> 00:35:38.101
H-O-K-U-T. Hokuto.

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.794
Hey, I didn't know you could read signal flags.

00:35:46.853 --> 00:35:47.966
Thank you both for coming.

00:35:48.415 --> 00:35:49.375
Umi, we're ready.

00:35:49.414 --> 00:35:50.481
OK!

00:36:02.395 --> 00:36:07.465
Forgive my sense of tradition, but why not
get married and start a practice right here?

00:36:07.791 --> 00:36:09.489
Would that mean we'd all have to move out?

00:36:09.566 --> 00:36:11.614
You'll probably be married by then.

00:36:11.793 --> 00:36:13.463
Oh, if only that were true.

00:36:13.479 --> 00:36:16.176
I'm going to marry a man who's brilliant, but sensitive.

00:36:16.493 --> 00:36:17.653
Hm, is he here?

00:36:18.151 --> 00:36:19.684
The trustees are the problem.

00:36:20.002 --> 00:36:22.130
We can't let them tear the place down.

00:36:22.155 --> 00:36:22.738
Agreed.

00:36:22.763 --> 00:36:23.795
What can we do?

00:36:24.073 --> 00:36:25.533
We need to go over their heads.

00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:26.485
To who?

00:36:26.617 --> 00:36:28.494
The principal just does what the board tells him.

00:36:28.809 --> 00:36:29.504
I don't know.

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:32.355
We all just need to be really smart about this.

00:36:32.371 --> 00:36:33.285
We need a strategy.

00:36:33.629 --> 00:36:35.653
We need one fast, before it's too late.

00:36:39.597 --> 00:36:41.284
We keep running out of glasses.

00:36:41.591 --> 00:36:42.432
Well, I'll wash some.

00:36:42.984 --> 00:36:44.068
You take that out.

00:36:44.093 --> 00:36:44.737
OK.

00:36:48.852 --> 00:36:49.709
OK, everyone.

00:36:49.725 --> 00:36:50.724
Sushi's ready.

00:36:53.209 --> 00:36:55.420
This building was built at the turn of the century.

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:56.998
It actually used to be a hospital.

00:37:04.629 --> 00:37:05.850
See that carving up there?

00:37:06.355 --> 00:37:07.800
It's over a hundred years old.

00:37:08.206 --> 00:37:09.933
My great-grandfather loved cats.

00:37:10.878 --> 00:37:14.011
Compared to the clubhouse, this
all looks practically brand new.

00:37:14.306 --> 00:37:15.300
It's incredible.

00:37:15.948 --> 00:37:18.300
And I'm guessing you're part of the reason why?

00:37:19.816 --> 00:37:21.581
So your grandfather was a doctor?

00:37:22.128 --> 00:37:23.433
Was your dad a doctor, too?

00:37:23.598 --> 00:37:24.323
Mm-mm.

00:37:24.683 --> 00:37:26.058
He was the captain of a ship.

00:37:29.375 --> 00:37:33.760
From this valley they say you are going.

00:37:34.302 --> 00:37:38.565
We will miss your bright eyes, and your smile.

00:37:39.057 --> 00:37:42.049
Far from us, you are taking the sunshine...

00:37:42.065 --> 00:37:44.236
So your mom married a sailor.

00:37:44.643 --> 00:37:49.706
My grandpa and gran, they didn't approve of the
marriage, and so they tried to stop it from happening.

00:37:50.307 --> 00:37:53.760
But my mom wouldn't let anything
stand in the way of true love.

00:37:53.841 --> 00:37:55.259
That took guts.

00:37:55.588 --> 00:37:57.752
She defied her parents and married him anyway?

00:37:58.427 --> 00:37:59.057
Mm-hm.

00:38:00.182 --> 00:38:03.230
And your dad, he taught you how to use the signal flags.

00:38:08.926 --> 00:38:09.897
Mm, yeah, he did.

00:38:10.155 --> 00:38:11.406
When I was just a girl.

00:38:16.349 --> 00:38:21.029
He said they helped him find his way
back to us, so I raised them every day.

00:38:22.465 --> 00:38:23.674
It was at our old house.

00:38:25.091 --> 00:38:27.646
I'd raise them from the balcony
until his ship docked again.

00:38:29.127 --> 00:38:29.732
Every day.

00:38:31.445 --> 00:38:33.115
Every single day.

00:38:35.898 --> 00:38:37.867
Then we got news about his ship.

00:38:38.266 --> 00:38:40.149
That it sank during the Korean War.

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.742
They never found him, and that was that.

00:38:45.047 --> 00:38:48.297
But I kept raising the flags,
hoping they might help him find me.

00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:52.188
And when we moved here, I was
so upset, I couldn't stop crying.

00:38:52.497 --> 00:38:55.524
There was nowhere to raise the flags, and I felt so lost.

00:38:56.428 --> 00:38:58.240
So grandpa built me that flagpole.

00:39:13.929 --> 00:39:15.180
We could use a little light.

00:39:18.477 --> 00:39:21.173
Grandmother said this used to be my grandfather's office,

00:39:21.438 --> 00:39:23.665
but now it's sort of become my mom's private study.

00:39:23.806 --> 00:39:25.220
She sure likes to read.

00:39:27.314 --> 00:39:28.736
Is this your family?

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:30.267
Yes.

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:32.298
Your father?

00:39:34.132 --> 00:39:34.757
Mm-mm.

00:39:35.183 --> 00:39:36.457
That's my grandfather.

00:39:36.967 --> 00:39:37.889
My dad's right there.

00:39:42.618 --> 00:39:43.532
Handsome, isn't he?

00:39:44.011 --> 00:39:45.745
That's from around the time they got married.

00:39:47.089 --> 00:39:49.120
Now, this is the photo I really love.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.758
Yuichiro Sawamura?

00:40:02.242 --> 00:40:03.352
That's my dad's name.

00:40:03.579 --> 00:40:05.782
My mom kept the name Matsuzaki.

00:40:06.493 --> 00:40:07.524
Umi, come on!

00:40:07.554 --> 00:40:09.192
You're gonna miss Miki's speech.

00:40:09.217 --> 00:40:09.907
OK.

00:40:09.971 --> 00:40:10.430
Coming.

00:40:10.594 --> 00:40:11.508
We'd better get back.

00:40:24.583 --> 00:40:25.385
Thanks for coming.

00:40:25.834 --> 00:40:26.955
Oh, you're welcome.

00:40:30.297 --> 00:40:31.307
Bye.

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:02.126
Hey, I'm home.

00:41:11.305 --> 00:41:12.125
You're late.

00:41:13.632 --> 00:41:15.509
When you're late, your mother worries.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.891
Shun, would you like some dinner?

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:29.606
I ate already.

00:41:29.631 --> 00:41:31.471
...seems to catch the signal and eyes.

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.821
He sets.

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:35.290
And here's the pitch.

00:41:35.415 --> 00:41:38.079
Na gas him a swings and he misses!

00:41:38.095 --> 00:41:39.587
Na gas him a strikes out.

00:41:49.876 --> 00:41:52.218
UMI'S VOICE Now, this is the photo I really love.

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:56.007
They never found him, and that was that.

00:41:58.078 --> 00:41:59.898
Yuichiro Sawamura.

00:42:21.733 --> 00:42:22.436
Welcome.

00:42:24.178 --> 00:42:25.100
Thanks for coming.

00:42:29.005 --> 00:42:29.942
Whoa.

00:42:32.005 --> 00:42:35.911
We members of the Latin Quarter welcome all volunteers.

00:42:36.138 --> 00:42:41.731
And for offering to help us restore and preserve
this treasured and magnificent cultural landmark,

00:42:41.826 --> 00:42:43.255
we humbly salute you.

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:54.000
Fellow club members, are you
ready to fight for what you cherish?

00:42:54.125 --> 00:42:56.540
Yeah!

00:42:56.569 --> 00:42:57.626
Let's get to work.

00:43:13.793 --> 00:43:14.905
No!

00:43:15.271 --> 00:43:16.280
My hut!

00:43:16.488 --> 00:43:18.157
No exceptions.

00:43:18.173 --> 00:43:19.591
That's the rule!

00:43:19.607 --> 00:43:21.734
One hand, lift!

00:43:34.352 --> 00:43:35.065
Hey, watch out.

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:38.213
Don't... don't, don't bump the rail!

00:43:38.964 --> 00:43:40.445
Watch out below!

00:43:42.948 --> 00:43:44.398
Hey, you're welcome!

00:44:04.158 --> 00:44:06.166
First Year Math, Second Year Math.

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.127
Wow, these are really old exams.

00:44:08.611 --> 00:44:10.736
We use all these for the mock tests we print.

00:44:11.189 --> 00:44:11.565
Whoa.

00:44:11.861 --> 00:44:13.549
This is Miki's math final.

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:15.221
She got a perfect score.

00:44:15.237 --> 00:44:15.986
Oh.

00:44:24.878 --> 00:44:25.925
I gotta go.

00:44:26.089 --> 00:44:28.214
Yamazaki, take over for me, will you?

00:44:28.714 --> 00:44:29.534
Sure thing.

00:44:33.684 --> 00:44:34.499
Here, Umi.

00:44:34.524 --> 00:44:35.092
Huh?

00:44:35.231 --> 00:44:35.997
Oh.

00:44:36.106 --> 00:44:38.864
Mizunuma said to toss anything we don't need.

00:44:39.051 --> 00:44:40.567
No reason to get sentimental.

00:44:48.162 --> 00:44:49.521
Ugh, what a mess.

00:44:49.576 --> 00:44:51.678
Didn't you guys ever clean this place?

00:44:51.873 --> 00:44:52.373
Nope.

00:44:52.397 --> 00:44:54.100
And neither did the guys before us.

00:44:54.857 --> 00:44:55.584
Ew!

00:44:55.701 --> 00:44:58.482
I think tomorrow we'd better bring the badminton team.

00:44:58.648 --> 00:45:00.252
We love badminton!

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.900
Wow.

00:45:26.916 --> 00:45:28.323
It's really hot.

00:45:28.423 --> 00:45:29.791
Fire often is.

00:45:30.596 --> 00:45:31.487
Sora!

00:45:31.713 --> 00:45:33.479
It's time to go home now.

00:45:33.563 --> 00:45:34.432
OK.

00:45:34.976 --> 00:45:37.299
I'm just gonna stay a little while longer.

00:45:37.315 --> 00:45:38.315
Bye!

00:45:55.821 --> 00:45:58.027
So what's going on between you and Umi?

00:45:59.616 --> 00:46:01.327
Uh, nothing's going on.

00:46:03.358 --> 00:46:04.389
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:46:04.622 --> 00:46:05.191
Yeah.

00:47:00.025 --> 00:47:00.677
Father?

00:47:00.874 --> 00:47:02.546
There's something I'd like to ask you.

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.304
I have to concentrate, so make it short.

00:47:07.984 --> 00:47:12.539
Yuichiro Sawamura is the man in this
photo, and he's my real father, right?

00:47:16.875 --> 00:47:18.788
We've already discussed all of this.

00:47:22.117 --> 00:47:23.852
You're my son, and that's that.

00:47:25.587 --> 00:47:26.203
Mm-hm.

00:48:03.291 --> 00:48:05.586
We didn't know what to think, the night he brought you.

00:48:07.258 --> 00:48:11.549
We had recently lost a child of our own,
and were struggling through a difficult time.

00:48:17.483 --> 00:48:23.279
Sawamura came to our door with you his arms,
and a copy of this family register in his pocket.

00:48:24.635 --> 00:48:26.167
The war had taken its toll.

00:48:26.608 --> 00:48:29.943
He was going off to sea, and his
wife was unable to care for you.

00:48:30.428 --> 00:48:34.342
Before I knew it, your mother
had you in her arms, nursing you.

00:48:35.709 --> 00:48:36.950
She wouldn't let you go.

00:48:39.318 --> 00:48:41.219
Sawamura was a good sailor.

00:48:41.537 --> 00:48:46.358
In the Korean War, he was on a supply
ship that sank, and all of the men died.

00:48:47.373 --> 00:48:49.381
He sent money and asked about you often.

00:48:51.451 --> 00:48:53.647
You remind me of him more and more every day.

00:48:55.053 --> 00:48:56.975
But you will always be our son.

00:49:00.431 --> 00:49:01.320
Thank you, father.

00:49:26.041 --> 00:49:27.384
Sachiko, do you see it?

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:28.334
Is there any answer?

00:49:28.359 --> 00:49:29.151
Not yet.

00:49:40.888 --> 00:49:42.980
I guess it's not coming by today.

00:50:34.165 --> 00:50:35.072
Hello, Miki.

00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:36.480
Umi.

00:50:36.718 --> 00:50:37.514
Come on in.

00:50:43.027 --> 00:50:44.300
You're really leaving, aren't you?

00:50:44.745 --> 00:50:46.401
We all have to move on, don't we?

00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:48.284
I wish I could see you off.

00:50:48.616 --> 00:50:49.450
It's OK.

00:50:49.475 --> 00:50:50.848
I know you have to get to school.

00:50:52.203 --> 00:50:53.355
I'm going to miss you.

00:50:54.414 --> 00:50:55.745
I'll drop by now and then.

00:50:56.124 --> 00:50:57.081
Now, go.

00:50:57.117 --> 00:50:58.203
Before I start crying.

00:50:59.127 --> 00:50:59.733
Mm-hm.

00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:04.647
I hope everything works out with you and Shun.

00:51:04.851 --> 00:51:05.343
Huh?

00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:11.155
Take care, Miki.

00:51:27.322 --> 00:51:29.037
Extra, extra, extra!

00:51:29.053 --> 00:51:30.131
Latin Quarter gets a facelift!

00:51:30.147 --> 00:51:30.537
Thank you.

00:51:30.553 --> 00:51:31.115
Thanks very much.

00:51:31.138 --> 00:51:31.701
Here you go.

00:51:31.717 --> 00:51:31.936

Thank you.

00:51:34.412 --> 00:51:35.663
Latin Quarter gets a facelift!

00:51:35.663 --> 00:51:36.956
We really need your help today.

00:51:36.972 --> 00:51:37.498
Get your papers right here!

Thank you.

00:51:42.209 --> 00:51:43.655
I'll be there again today.

00:51:43.671 --> 00:51:44.045
Great.

00:51:44.061 --> 00:51:44.853
Still lots to do.

00:51:44.964 --> 00:51:45.840
Hi, Shun!

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:47.008
How's it all going?

00:51:47.008 --> 00:51:47.506
Fine.

00:51:47.633 --> 00:51:48.576
I'll try and see you there.

00:51:48.592 --> 00:51:49.225
Hey, hey!

00:51:49.344 --> 00:51:50.762
I'll see you there later, all right?

00:51:51.012 --> 00:51:51.287
Spread the word.

00:51:51.303 --> 00:51:52.021
One for you, Umi.

00:51:54.557 --> 00:51:55.660
Extra! I.

00:51:55.692 --> 00:51:56.957

00:51:56.973 --> 00:51:58.590

Latin Quarter Weekly, right here!

00:52:10.844 --> 00:52:12.486
The next label is complete.

00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:13.353
OK.

00:52:17.113 --> 00:52:18.754
Don't hurt yourself, Shun!

00:52:18.873 --> 00:52:19.644
Shun!

00:52:20.011 --> 00:52:21.584
He's so brave.

00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:23.136
Don't fall!

00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:24.706
Be careful up there!

00:52:24.722 --> 00:52:25.394
Careful!

00:52:27.925 --> 00:52:29.370
That was amazing!

00:52:29.386 --> 00:52:30.176
He did it!

00:52:30.176 --> 00:52:31.052
Now, he's cool.

00:52:31.052 --> 00:52:31.996
So cool.

00:52:36.516 --> 00:52:37.661
This is exciting!

00:52:38.559 --> 00:52:39.809
Does he have a girlfriend?

00:52:57.577 --> 00:52:58.319
Oh.

00:53:13.164 --> 00:53:14.332
OK, I'm confused.

00:53:14.387 --> 00:53:15.438
Why are you mad at me?

00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:30.426
Yuichiro Sawamura is my real father.

00:53:30.903 --> 00:53:31.785
Huh?

00:53:32.246 --> 00:53:34.364
It's like a cheap melodrama.

00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:38.706
I don't understand.

00:53:39.412 --> 00:53:43.166
I didn't want to believe it, either, but
I checked with City Hall, and it's true.

00:53:43.444 --> 00:53:44.156
No!

00:53:45.877 --> 00:53:47.962
Umi, we're brother and sister.

00:53:52.258 --> 00:53:53.718
So what do we do now?

00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:57.461
I guess we stop feeling how we feel.

00:54:01.999 --> 00:54:04.749
We'll just have to go back to being friends.

00:54:29.294 --> 00:54:30.379
Hey, Sora.

00:54:30.568 --> 00:54:32.962
Did something happen to Umi at school today?

00:54:33.017 --> 00:54:34.361
I don't think so.

00:54:34.550 --> 00:54:36.095
At least not that I'm aware of.

00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:38.267
Are you certain?

00:54:38.679 --> 00:54:41.390
That dinner was surprisingly odd.

00:54:41.783 --> 00:54:43.189
And she was soaking wet.

00:54:44.143 --> 00:54:45.923
Something must have happened.

00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:49.158
Umi's never made a bad meal that I can remember.

00:54:49.852 --> 00:54:50.648
Hm.

00:54:57.942 --> 00:54:58.714
It's me, Umi.

00:54:58.956 --> 00:55:00.034
The bath's ready.

00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:02.059
Not tonight.

00:55:03.942 --> 00:55:04.877
You OK?

00:55:52.347 --> 00:55:53.176
Umi?

00:55:55.089 --> 00:55:56.340
Umi?

00:55:58.285 --> 00:55:59.536
Umi?

00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:49.313
Good morning, Umi.

00:56:49.610 --> 00:56:50.836
Did you sleep well?

00:56:51.748 --> 00:56:52.743
Mom, you're home.

00:56:53.219 --> 00:56:54.430
When did you get back?

00:56:55.222 --> 00:56:56.014
Don't be silly.

00:56:56.461 --> 00:56:58.235
You know I've been here all along.

00:57:00.318 --> 00:57:01.071
Umi!

00:57:01.766 --> 00:57:03.618
I'm hoisting the flags.

00:57:04.571 --> 00:57:05.766
Come give me a hand.

00:57:19.224 --> 00:57:20.383
Dad, is that you?

00:57:23.083 --> 00:57:25.263
Your flags led me home, Umi.

00:57:38.262 --> 00:57:40.153
You're such a big girl now.

00:59:09.454 --> 00:59:10.982
<i>Yeah, make sure it's secure!</i>

00:59:12.745 --> 00:59:16.212
As Latin Quarter alumni, we are more than happy to help.

00:59:16.582 --> 00:59:21.212
And if you need more supplies, Jiro here
is in construction, so just give him a call.

00:59:21.378 --> 00:59:22.630
Not for free, though.

00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:23.339
Why not?

00:59:23.339 --> 00:59:25.532
You told me business was booming, didn't you?

00:59:25.548 --> 00:59:27.133
Good bye, and good luck to you.

00:59:27.182 --> 00:59:28.948
Thank you very much.

00:59:29.790 --> 00:59:30.888
That was cool.

00:59:30.888 --> 00:59:32.501
Good thing we went to Miki's party.

00:59:32.517 --> 00:59:34.493
That Umi comes through for us again.

00:59:34.509 --> 00:59:35.142
Huh?

00:59:35.167 --> 00:59:37.557
She must be our goddess of good luck.

00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:38.247
Hi, guys.

00:59:38.272 --> 00:59:39.440
Morning.

00:59:41.421 --> 00:59:43.796
Wow, this looks like a real construction site.

00:59:51.296 --> 00:59:52.803
You call that plastering?

00:59:52.819 --> 00:59:54.038
Well, uh, uh...

00:59:54.054 --> 00:59:56.468
Give me that trowel, and let me show you how it's done.

00:59:56.655 --> 00:59:59.911
First you have to swirl it into a
smooth paste to get all the lumps out.

01:00:02.007 --> 01:00:05.249
Then up, over, left, right.

01:00:05.265 --> 01:00:05.724
Whoa.

01:00:05.805 --> 01:00:08.522
Left, right, spin, and up.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.178
Awesome!

01:00:11.334 --> 01:00:11.806
Yeah.

01:00:11.822 --> 01:00:14.014
They don't call my dad the Plaster King for nothing.

01:00:14.341 --> 01:00:16.218
You are beautiful.

01:00:16.243 --> 01:00:17.233
What did you say?

01:00:17.257 --> 01:00:17.966
Uh, the wall.

01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:19.116
I was talking to the wall.

01:00:19.538 --> 01:00:20.789
No, you weren't.

01:00:27.064 --> 01:00:27.753
Hey.

01:00:28.705 --> 01:00:30.073
It's already looking better.

01:00:32.214 --> 01:00:33.714
Sorry you had to stay late.

01:00:34.167 --> 01:00:35.722
I hope you won't be in trouble.

01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:37.909
Sora actually agreed to cover for me.

01:00:38.636 --> 01:00:40.018
Anything you need help with, Shun?

01:00:40.518 --> 01:00:46.261
Mm, uh, well, these papers need transcribing.

01:00:46.513 --> 01:00:47.080
OK.

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:52.814
So is that all you need from me?

01:00:52.994 --> 01:00:53.489
Yep.

01:00:53.619 --> 01:00:55.080
That's all I can think of.

01:00:55.409 --> 01:00:56.369
At least for now.

01:00:56.394 --> 01:00:57.089
OK, then.

01:00:57.549 --> 01:00:58.143
OK.

01:01:08.285 --> 01:01:09.840
So everything cool between you two?

01:01:13.189 --> 01:01:13.882
All cool.

01:01:26.276 --> 01:01:27.786
New Latin Quarter Weekly.

01:01:28.128 --> 01:01:29.682
Details about the renovation!

01:01:30.027 --> 01:01:32.362
Read about the new building, then see for yourself!

01:01:39.071 --> 01:01:40.054
Hot off the press!

01:01:40.079 --> 01:01:42.393
Majority of girls oppose demolition.

01:01:42.581 --> 01:01:44.487
Read about it in the Latin Quarter Weekly.

01:01:49.546 --> 01:01:51.092
Midterm results announced!

01:01:51.117 --> 01:01:53.961
Another victory for Latin Quarter mock tests.

01:01:54.141 --> 01:01:56.688
More mock tests in this week's Latin Quarter Weekly.

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:05.406
New poll results give new life to old building.

01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:06.750
Read about it here.

01:02:06.937 --> 01:02:09.390
Majority of all students oppose demolition.

01:02:19.368 --> 01:02:21.328
Everybody ready?

01:02:21.452 --> 01:02:22.210
Here we go.

01:02:26.588 --> 01:02:26.983
Yes!

01:02:30.755 --> 01:02:32.214
Yes!

01:02:32.214 --> 01:02:33.238
Huh?

01:02:49.146 --> 01:02:49.818
Hurray!

01:02:50.024 --> 01:02:50.357
Umi!

01:02:50.382 --> 01:02:51.195
Don't go anywhere.

01:02:51.926 --> 01:02:52.551
Shun!

01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:54.045
We're holding an emergency meeting.

01:02:54.239 --> 01:02:57.092
The board just voted to tear down
the Latin Quarter over the summer break.

01:02:57.406 --> 01:02:57.907
I did.

01:02:57.932 --> 01:03:00.132
I've tried reasoning with them, believe me.

01:03:00.659 --> 01:03:03.179
But the principal says it's out of his hands.

01:03:03.204 --> 01:03:04.830
What about all our hard work?

01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:06.787
They decided without even looking look at?

01:03:06.803 --> 01:03:09.248
Their massive egos wouldn't fit through the doors.

01:03:09.301 --> 01:03:09.787
“Right.

01:03:10.592 --> 01:03:12.088
Let's start a revolt!

01:03:12.088 --> 01:03:12.896
Take to the streets!

01:03:12.921 --> 01:03:13.671
Oh, yeah!

01:03:13.876 --> 01:03:15.818
Why don't we just take it straight to the chairman?

01:03:16.645 --> 01:03:19.065
The chairman's running a huge company in Tokyo.

01:03:19.225 --> 01:03:20.435
We'll never get to see him.

01:03:20.805 --> 01:03:24.217
In the words of Plato, tyranny must not prevail!

01:03:24.233 --> 01:03:24.650
Go!

01:03:24.666 --> 01:03:25.500
Fight the good fight!

01:03:25.516 --> 01:03:25.850
Come on!

01:03:25.866 --> 01:03:26.615
To Tokyo!

01:03:26.631 --> 01:03:27.144
Please go!

01:03:27.144 --> 01:03:27.645
Go for us!

01:03:27.645 --> 01:03:29.576
Let's go to Tokyo and make our case.

01:03:29.592 --> 01:03:30.740
That's right, Shun!

01:03:30.757 --> 01:03:31.662
Mizunuma.

01:03:32.725 --> 01:03:33.192
Please.

01:03:33.192 --> 01:03:33.795
Come on, Mizunuma.

01:03:33.811 --> 01:03:34.456
You have to!

01:03:36.642 --> 01:03:40.062
Only if our goddess of good luck joins us.

01:03:40.294 --> 01:03:41.075
Oh, good.

01:03:41.747 --> 01:03:42.205
Umi?

01:03:42.353 --> 01:03:43.393
Of course she'll go.

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:53.791
Hey, Umi.

01:03:54.579 --> 01:03:55.516
Good luck tomorrow.

01:04:09.478 --> 01:04:10.279
Ticket, sir.

01:04:10.676 --> 01:04:11.560
Here you go.

01:04:12.826 --> 01:04:13.513
Good morning.

01:04:13.529 --> 01:04:14.294
Thanks for waiting.

01:04:14.567 --> 01:04:15.109
You're welcome.

01:04:15.134 --> 01:04:15.343
No problem.

01:04:16.068 --> 01:04:17.568
We're very happy you're coming with us.

01:04:17.699 --> 01:04:18.207
Me too.

01:04:18.232 --> 01:04:20.373
It'll help take my mind off other things.

01:04:20.531 --> 01:04:21.323
Ticket, ma'am?

01:04:21.323 --> 01:04:22.849
Yes OK.

01:04:23.159 --> 01:04:23.802
Let's go.

01:05:10.015 --> 01:05:11.165
Well, into the breach?

01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.565
Mm-hm.

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.721
Students from the Konan Academy.

01:05:15.338 --> 01:05:16.002
That's right.

01:05:17.549 --> 01:05:19.215
And you don't have an appointment?

01:05:19.215 --> 01:05:19.744
No, sir.

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:21.776
We're appealing directly to Mr. Tokumaru.

01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:24.291
Something about a direct appeal.

01:05:24.916 --> 01:05:25.471
No.

01:05:25.705 --> 01:05:27.408
No, they don't seem like radicals.

01:05:28.349 --> 01:05:29.424
There's three of them.

01:05:30.935 --> 01:05:31.393
Al right.

01:05:31.393 --> 01:05:32.182
I'll tell them.

01:05:33.588 --> 01:05:38.182
Take the elevator at the end of the hall to the
fourth floor, and his office will be on the right.

01:05:38.651 --> 01:05:40.018
Thank you very much for your help.

01:05:40.268 --> 01:05:41.283
Don't forget to sign in.

01:05:41.487 --> 01:05:43.323
And next time, make an appointment.

01:05:51.506 --> 01:05:53.210
It's hard to know what's going to happen.

01:05:53.410 --> 01:05:55.139
Are you those students from Konan?

01:05:55.668 --> 01:05:56.147
Ma'am.

01:05:57.836 --> 01:06:03.499
Mr. Tokumaru is a very busy man, and he doesn't
normally see people who haven't made an appointment.

01:06:03.905 --> 01:06:04.510
Yes, ma'am.

01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:05.249
We understand.

01:06:05.397 --> 01:06:09.491
But speaking frankly, ma'am, we didn't actually believe
we would get an appointment if we called to make one.

01:06:09.958 --> 01:06:10.350
Ma'am.

01:06:11.108 --> 01:06:12.842
You're probably wasting your time.

01:06:12.977 --> 01:06:17.616
But since you seem determined, you can wait on
the bench as long as you don't disturb anyone.

01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:20.085
We thank you for your time, ma'am!

01:06:21.026 --> 01:06:22.361
What a year Nagashima's having.

01:06:22.361 --> 01:06:24.029
He could win another MVP.

01:06:24.029 --> 01:06:25.364
Scoring a lot of goals.

01:06:25.364 --> 01:06:25.864
Goals?

01:06:25.864 --> 01:06:27.288
Have you even seen baseball?

01:06:35.207 --> 01:06:36.024
Thank you, ma'am.

01:06:56.228 --> 01:06:56.882
Oh!

01:07:02.725 --> 01:07:03.733
Come on, then.

01:07:03.863 --> 01:07:04.828
Let's go get a drink.

01:07:04.862 --> 01:07:06.217
Quick, before he makes us stay.

01:07:19.626 --> 01:07:20.556
You're still here?

01:07:20.695 --> 01:07:21.767
Well, come on in.

01:07:22.522 --> 01:07:23.337
Thank you.

01:07:26.041 --> 01:07:27.048
Oh, yes. Right.

01:07:27.064 --> 01:07:28.072
Thank you for seeing us.

01:07:28.877 --> 01:07:29.806
Uh-huh.

01:07:30.697 --> 01:07:31.455
Yes?

01:07:31.767 --> 01:07:32.517
Uh-huh.

01:07:33.173 --> 01:07:34.080
Hang on.

01:07:34.314 --> 01:07:35.064
Have a seat.

01:07:35.447 --> 01:07:37.056
I'll be with you gentlemen in a minute.

01:07:37.986 --> 01:07:38.896
Al right.

01:07:38.896 --> 01:07:40.423
I've made my decision.

01:07:40.541 --> 01:07:42.634
I can't agree to that right now.

01:07:43.228 --> 01:07:43.884
Yes.

01:07:44.193 --> 01:07:44.759
Bye.

01:07:50.936 --> 01:07:51.926
Sit down.

01:07:52.418 --> 01:07:54.878
Why are you kids here today, and not in school?

01:07:55.184 --> 01:07:56.816
Because, sir, we escaped.

01:07:57.706 --> 01:07:58.660
Escaped, huh?

01:07:58.676 --> 01:08:00.254
I did that a lot myself.

01:08:00.521 --> 01:08:01.012
Yeah.

01:08:01.835 --> 01:08:04.588
Well, I guess you're here to
talk to me about that old clubhouse.

01:08:04.588 --> 01:08:05.074
Yes.

01:08:05.325 --> 01:08:08.092
We've come to you directly to ask
you to see the building for yourself.

01:08:08.285 --> 01:08:09.746
We've put a lot of work into it.

01:08:09.761 --> 01:08:10.816
Come see what we've done.

01:08:10.832 --> 01:08:11.926
That's all we're asking.

01:08:11.942 --> 01:08:12.793
Hm.

01:08:13.770 --> 01:08:15.113
What year are you, young lady?

01:08:15.690 --> 01:08:16.481
Second year.

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:18.566
My name is Umi Matsuzaki.

01:08:18.685 --> 01:08:20.934
Sir, that building is more than just a building.

01:08:22.692 --> 01:08:25.192
And tell me, how is it more than just a building?

01:08:25.395 --> 01:08:27.786
Oh, because we all love it.

01:08:27.802 --> 01:08:30.481
And it makes us feel connected to our past.

01:08:30.864 --> 01:08:32.247
Like we belong to something.

01:08:34.664 --> 01:08:36.743
Connected to our past.

01:08:36.931 --> 01:08:37.688
Hm.

01:08:38.212 --> 01:08:39.884
May I ask what your father did?

01:08:41.204 --> 01:08:43.766
He was a captain on a supply ship.

01:08:44.192 --> 01:08:46.360
But his ship sank during the Korean War.

01:08:51.874 --> 01:08:53.760
They had made a delivery and were coming home.

01:08:56.330 --> 01:08:57.533
But his ship hit a mine.

01:09:19.949 --> 01:09:21.105
A supply ship.

01:09:21.693 --> 01:09:22.238
Yes, sir.

01:09:24.187 --> 01:09:25.113
I'm sorry.

01:09:26.352 --> 01:09:30.058
I know it must have been very hard
for your mother, raising you on her own.

01:09:30.824 --> 01:09:32.777
She obviously did a fine job.

01:09:34.148 --> 01:09:34.879
Thank you.

01:09:36.799 --> 01:09:37.683
All right.

01:09:37.803 --> 01:09:38.668
I'll go.

01:09:42.475 --> 01:09:43.816
Thank you, Mr. Chairman!

01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:47.749
So, tomorrow.

01:09:48.228 --> 01:09:49.045
How's it look?

01:09:50.678 --> 01:09:52.108
Right, that's in the evening.

01:09:53.772 --> 01:09:55.030
Move the rest to Friday.

01:09:57.208 --> 01:09:59.701
Now, I'll be there tomorrow afternoon.

01:09:59.799 --> 01:10:01.670
I'll handle everything with your principal.

01:10:01.778 --> 01:10:03.397
The rest will be your job.

01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:06.385
I know, I know.

01:10:09.010 --> 01:10:10.506
I actually didn't think that would work.

01:10:10.713 --> 01:10:12.260
Yeah, I'm still not sure it has.

01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:15.424
Well, I'm glad we came.

01:10:18.048 --> 01:10:20.244
I promised my mom I'd go visit my uncle.

01:10:20.525 --> 01:10:21.433
See you tomorrow!

01:10:58.595 --> 01:10:59.562
What do you think you'll do?

01:10:59.578 --> 01:11:01.163
You know, after graduation?

01:11:01.663 --> 01:11:02.307
Hm.

01:11:02.307 --> 01:11:05.335
Well, we don't have much money,
so probably National University.

01:11:05.932 --> 01:11:07.234
What'll happen to the Weekly?

01:11:08.359 --> 01:11:11.249
I'll have to find somebody
dedicated enough to take it over.

01:11:11.946 --> 01:11:12.798
What about you?

01:11:14.782 --> 01:11:19.609
I haven't decided, but I'm sort of
thinking I might like to be a doctor.

01:11:19.992 --> 01:11:20.351
Hm.

01:11:28.090 --> 01:11:29.133
Shun, are you...

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:31.528
Are you one who wrote that poem in the paper?

01:11:31.711 --> 01:11:32.333
Mm-hm.

01:11:32.989 --> 01:11:36.942
I saw those flags every morning from my
dad's tugboat, and I found out it was you.

01:11:38.427 --> 01:11:41.348
Well, I can't really see any of the boats from the garden.

01:11:42.076 --> 01:11:46.380
So that's why I never noticed there
was somebody out there, answering me.

01:11:58.560 --> 01:11:59.478
Can I tell you something?

01:11:59.606 --> 01:12:00.085
Hm?

01:12:02.428 --> 01:12:04.740
Those flags that I raise.

01:12:07.213 --> 01:12:11.126
They're a message to my father, and
it says, I pray for your safe return.

01:12:11.269 --> 01:12:15.464
But he knows he can never come back to me,
so what I think he did was send you instead.

01:12:20.382 --> 01:12:22.842
And I don't really know what to do, because we're...

01:12:22.858 --> 01:12:23.481
Umi.

01:12:24.052 --> 01:12:28.481
Look, I know we can't do anything
about it, but just know, I love you.

01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:40.302
And I love you, too.

01:13:00.911 --> 01:13:01.968
Hey, I'm home.

01:13:08.888 --> 01:13:09.913
Mom, you're home.

01:13:10.827 --> 01:13:13.061
Umi, it's good to be back.

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:15.955
Tell me about America and your studies.

01:13:16.021 --> 01:13:18.486
Oh, I learned something new every day.

01:13:19.486 --> 01:13:21.655
But mostly how much I missed home.

01:13:21.655 --> 01:13:23.027
And we missed you.

01:13:23.126 --> 01:13:25.298
This is the best thing I've ever ate.

01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:27.353
It's beef jerky.

01:13:27.828 --> 01:13:28.736
So is it pork?

01:13:29.121 --> 01:13:31.456
Sachiko, beef means cow.

01:13:44.554 --> 01:13:45.078
Mom?

01:13:47.723 --> 01:13:48.515
What's wrong?

01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:49.580
Why are you awake?

01:13:54.173 --> 01:13:56.273
There's something I need to talk to you about.

01:13:56.523 --> 01:13:57.586
Of course, Umi.

01:14:03.532 --> 01:14:05.152
It must be the time change.

01:14:05.536 --> 01:14:09.003
I can't sleep, so I thought I would
organize these books I got in America.

01:14:09.098 --> 01:14:10.411
There's this boy at school.

01:14:10.570 --> 01:14:12.535
His name is Shun Kazama.

01:14:15.966 --> 01:14:20.464
I'm so confused, because he came here for Miki's
party, and I showed him the photograph of dad.

01:14:20.489 --> 01:14:25.404
And he had the exact same photo, and he said
his father and my father are one in the same.

01:14:45.309 --> 01:14:46.111
This photo?

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:51.080
Mm-hm.

01:14:52.072 --> 01:14:56.080
Well, I knew the day would come when
I would have to explain this to you.

01:14:57.572 --> 01:15:01.026
I told you the story about how
your father and I eloped, didn't I?

01:15:02.549 --> 01:15:04.283
And do you remember where we used to live?

01:15:04.309 --> 01:15:08.463
Downtown in that second floor apartment,
with the balcony off the living room?

01:15:09.738 --> 01:15:12.407
We were newly married, and I was pregnant with you.

01:15:12.423 --> 01:15:17.760
And your dad was away at sea a lot, and I
was working on my degree, studying very hard.

01:15:18.589 --> 01:15:22.711
I was determined to do well in
school, in case something happened.

01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:32.883
Our lives were already complicated when
your father returned home one night with a baby.

01:15:33.245 --> 01:15:33.766
Hey.

01:15:39.584 --> 01:15:40.225
Welcome...

01:15:41.566 --> 01:15:42.426
Yuichiro.

01:15:42.587 --> 01:15:43.715
Whose baby is that?

01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:45.926
He's Tachibana's.

01:15:46.387 --> 01:15:47.355
We need to take him.

01:15:47.871 --> 01:15:48.387
What?

01:15:49.488 --> 01:15:53.504
Tachibana was killed in an
accident aboard a repatriation ship.

01:15:54.168 --> 01:15:57.683
His poor wife died from complications during childbirth.

01:15:58.065 --> 01:16:00.480
The rest of his family was killed at Nagasaki.

01:16:01.402 --> 01:16:04.066
I won't have this child sent to an orphanage.

01:16:05.803 --> 01:16:10.715
Your father had legally adopted a
newborn baby without even asking me.

01:16:11.289 --> 01:16:15.426
The war had just ended, and things
like this were happening everywhere.

01:16:16.683 --> 01:16:21.691
Still, there was just no way I could
give the child the love and care he deserved.

01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:26.308
One of Yuichiro's friends recently
lost a child, so we gave the baby to him.

01:16:27.936 --> 01:16:28.652
How is he?

01:16:28.904 --> 01:16:30.402
Tell me, is he doing well?

01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:32.621
Mm-hm.

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:34.574
I'm glad.

01:16:36.351 --> 01:16:40.480
Your father was impulsive, but he
always did what he thought was right.

01:16:41.332 --> 01:16:44.722
It was a relief to see the
baby end up with a loving family.

01:16:46.121 --> 01:16:51.463
Are you absolutely sure that Shun
couldn't possibly be dad's real son?

01:16:52.721 --> 01:16:54.557
I don't think I ever considered it.

01:16:55.603 --> 01:16:56.588
Why do you ask?

01:16:57.323 --> 01:16:59.659
Don't tell me he actually looks like your father?

01:17:04.072 --> 01:17:04.729
Mm-hm.

01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:15.082
Oh, Umi, sweetheart.

01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:47.293
See you tonight.

01:17:47.309 --> 01:17:47.897
Yeah, mom.

01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:48.756
See you tonight.

01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:50.141
Have a great day, girls.

01:18:37.846 --> 01:18:38.629
Hm.

01:18:53.564 --> 01:18:55.506
Hello again, Mr. Chairman, and welcome.

01:18:55.810 --> 01:18:57.474
Yeah, yeah.

01:18:58.450 --> 01:18:59.326
Hm.

01:19:22.223 --> 01:19:24.982
Never knew this existed under all that dust.

01:19:25.045 --> 01:19:25.602
Oh, yes, sir.

01:19:25.602 --> 01:19:26.912
They've done a good job.

01:19:28.605 --> 01:19:30.975
And what is your club studying, young man?

01:19:31.066 --> 01:19:31.490
Sir!

01:19:31.896 --> 01:19:34.903
The Astronomy Club has been studying
sunspots for the last ten years, sir.

01:19:34.903 --> 01:19:36.709
Oh, the last ten years, huh?

01:19:36.890 --> 01:19:39.373
Tell me, what discoveries have you made?

01:19:39.666 --> 01:19:43.256
That the sun is very, very old,
and our lifespans very, very short.

01:19:43.748 --> 01:19:45.584
No discoveries so far, sir!

01:19:46.485 --> 01:19:47.615
Honest answer.

01:19:54.605 --> 01:19:55.781
Philosophy Club?

01:19:56.645 --> 01:20:00.106
Seems to me you could really
benefit from a brand new clubhouse.

01:20:01.169 --> 01:20:03.606
And something nice for your junior members.

01:20:03.890 --> 01:20:08.270
We as human beings have complicated
every simple gift of the gods!

01:20:08.435 --> 01:20:09.856
Quoting Diogenes?

01:20:14.488 --> 01:20:18.213
I must say, principal, these students
of yours are very, very impressive.

01:20:18.658 --> 01:20:20.603
I'm gonna take a little look inside.

01:20:20.619 --> 01:20:21.579
Shun Kazama?

01:20:21.595 --> 01:20:22.174
Yes?

01:20:24.774 --> 01:20:25.787
Where's Plato?

01:20:26.042 --> 01:20:27.927
And what's that dog doing in there?

01:20:29.490 --> 01:20:30.291
Hello, dad?

01:20:30.324 --> 01:20:31.085
What's wrong?

01:20:31.248 --> 01:20:33.865
The third man in that photo is here at the harbor.

01:20:34.044 --> 01:20:36.177
I know he can tell you about your father.

01:20:36.598 --> 01:20:37.172
Huh?

01:20:37.382 --> 01:20:40.341
But his ship is leaning at... oh, 4:00!

01:20:40.767 --> 01:20:42.371
And he'll be away for several months.

01:20:42.387 --> 01:20:43.130
Get here!

01:20:43.263 --> 01:20:44.279
Get here fast!

01:20:55.275 --> 01:21:04.578
If the world should sink beneath the sea,
reach out your hand and find a friend in need.

01:21:04.664 --> 01:21:12.633
Brave the storm with head held
high, stand together side by side.

01:21:14.727 --> 01:21:23.617
Just like the mighty mountains
rising high above the fields.

01:21:24.172 --> 01:21:32.586
If we all stand together, then there
is nothing that will make us yield.

01:21:32.977 --> 01:21:42.363
If the world should sink beneath the sea,
reach out your hand and find a friend in need.

01:21:42.402 --> 01:21:51.582
Brave the storm with head held
high, stand together side by side.

01:21:53.531 --> 01:21:57.688
Students, while I am very impressed with your dedication,

01:21:57.797 --> 01:22:01.531
it doesn't change the fact that a new building is needed.

01:22:03.799 --> 01:22:08.377
So, I guess that makes it my job
to find a different place to put it.

01:22:14.598 --> 01:22:15.599
Yes!

01:22:15.615 --> 01:22:17.381
Yes!

01:22:17.857 --> 01:22:18.615
Thank you!

01:22:18.818 --> 01:22:19.818
Thank you, sir!

01:22:21.290 --> 01:22:22.708
Hooray!

01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:24.202
Hooray!

01:22:26.783 --> 01:22:28.701
On to the next experiment.

01:22:28.726 --> 01:22:29.384
Yeah!

01:22:30.046 --> 01:22:32.726
None of this would have happened without our goddess, Umi.

01:22:33.331 --> 01:22:33.706
Mm-hm.

01:22:33.706 --> 01:22:36.265
Thanks, but I really didn't do anything.

01:22:36.554 --> 01:22:37.421
Oh, come on.

01:22:37.476 --> 01:22:39.601
Quit being so modest and say, you're welcome.

01:22:40.148 --> 01:22:41.850
You are heaven sent!

01:22:41.866 --> 01:22:42.835
Thank you, Umi.

01:22:43.429 --> 01:22:44.023
Thank you!

01:22:44.249 --> 01:22:46.327
She's our little angel, Umi.

01:22:47.553 --> 01:22:48.471
Umi!

01:22:48.471 --> 01:22:49.273
Huh?

01:22:50.485 --> 01:22:51.602
You have to come.

01:22:53.015 --> 01:22:54.069
He's so dreamy.

01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:55.078
Perfect couple.

01:22:55.103 --> 01:22:56.062
You're so lucky.

01:22:56.062 --> 01:22:56.866
Good luck!

01:22:58.351 --> 01:22:59.187
Sorry, sir.

01:22:59.936 --> 01:23:05.296
I'm certain Umi and Shun wish they could be here to thank
you personally, but urgent matters have taken them away.

01:23:05.844 --> 01:23:07.101
Urgent matters, huh?

01:23:07.474 --> 01:23:08.874
Ah, to be young.

01:23:13.863 --> 01:23:14.675
Hey, Shun!

01:23:15.425 --> 01:23:16.027
Gen!

01:23:16.386 --> 01:23:17.566
Can you give us a ride?

01:23:18.652 --> 01:23:19.480
Umi!

01:23:26.493 --> 01:23:27.314
Ah!

01:23:28.814 --> 01:23:30.847
Umi, don't you worry, and hang on.

01:23:30.872 --> 01:23:32.746
I'll get you there with time to spare.

01:23:43.528 --> 01:23:45.086
If we're gonna make it, we'd better run.

01:23:45.111 --> 01:23:45.611
OK.

01:23:45.636 --> 01:23:46.429
Thanks, Gen.

01:23:48.494 --> 01:23:50.266
Sorry I couldn't get you there, Umi!

01:23:57.915 --> 01:23:58.677
Shun!

01:23:58.833 --> 01:23:59.552
Hurry!

01:24:02.516 --> 01:24:02.980
Thanks.

01:24:32.139 --> 01:24:33.451
That's my dad's tug.

01:24:50.385 --> 01:24:51.102
Come on.

01:25:01.092 --> 01:25:02.585
The kids are here to see you, captain.

01:25:12.337 --> 01:25:14.214
Push our departure back by fifteen.

01:25:14.230 --> 01:25:14.633
Aye.

01:25:19.344 --> 01:25:22.578
So then, you're my good friend Tachibana's boy?

01:25:22.859 --> 01:25:23.281
Yes, sir.

01:25:24.242 --> 01:25:26.656
And you must be Sawamura's daughter.

01:25:27.088 --> 01:25:28.438
Pleasure to meet you both.

01:25:44.147 --> 01:25:45.564
Your name is Shun, right?

01:25:45.982 --> 01:25:46.509
Yes, sir.

01:25:46.802 --> 01:25:52.642
Your father was Hiros hi Tachibana, and that's
him sitting in the front row, fourth from the right.

01:25:52.907 --> 01:25:55.540
And sitting next to him is Sawamura.

01:25:56.822 --> 01:25:59.611
We were just like brothers, the three of us.

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:02.571
Tachibana, you should take the seat of honor.

01:26:02.776 --> 01:26:03.540
But why me?

01:26:03.733 --> 01:26:05.152
Because you're our fearless leader.

01:26:05.168 --> 01:26:05.884
You belong there.

01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:08.314
If I'm your leader, we're in trouble.

01:26:11.446 --> 01:26:13.848
Don't be the hero and die before me, OK?

01:26:15.050 --> 01:26:16.074
Same goes for you.

01:26:17.054 --> 01:26:18.363
Gentlemen, hold still.

01:26:30.735 --> 01:26:33.101
They were the best friends a man ever had.

01:26:33.299 --> 01:26:34.968
I think about them every day.

01:26:35.388 --> 01:26:39.101
They were brave and honest, and
I'm honored to have known them.

01:26:40.447 --> 01:26:44.843
When I look at you, what I see is
the legacy of those two great men.

01:26:45.327 --> 01:26:48.288
And I know they would be very proud.
