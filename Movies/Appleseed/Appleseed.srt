He got himself away

because he knew they'd had it.

His best chance of escape

was while we were

He's a kind of career terrorist,

168
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,675
I've been checkin' out
our suspect's file.

169
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,944
His name's AJ Sebastian,
he's quite a boy.

170
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,946
The SSSP have taken
over the case.

171
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,814
- I knew that guy
was big trouble,

172
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,249
[printer beeps]

173
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,685
especially if Central
Admin want to get involved.

174
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:49,087
So why are the SSSP
interested in this man?

175
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,755
- All I know is
he was once caught

176
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,457
trying to sneak into Gaia.

177
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,093
I can only guess, but I'd reckon
this guy's not a terrorist

178
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,296
because he wants money, he's
out to change the world.

179
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:01,900
That's why the SSSP are
holding all information on him.

180
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,602
- And that's why I'm
putting in this application

181
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,570
for a secondment.

182
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:06,271
- What, and leave SWAT?

183
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,606
I don't believe it.

184
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,541
You'll miss all the excitement.

185
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,911
Anyway, so where are
you gonna transfer to?

186
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,212
- I'm going to investigation.

187
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,214
- Huh, you can't be serious.

188
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,682
What for?

189
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,484
- [Dunan] Because I want
to find that son of a bitch

190
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,919
and kill him.

back with her this time.

00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,624
every human she brings in
here has to be rehabilitated.

200
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,626
The cost to Olympion
Social Services,

201
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,429
not to mention the police,
is getting extortionate.

202
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,930
- Well, that can't be helped.

203
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,832
The General Management
Control Office are aiming

for total integration
to Olumpos.

[ominous music]
- Well-meaning idiots.

209
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,813
The outside world doesn't
breed human beings.

210
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,881
It's full of psychopaths
and lunatics.

211
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,116
Experimenting with them

212
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,351
will only destabilize
Olympion society.

213
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,686
They'll never integrate.

214
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:04,055
How can they after
living in that hell?

215
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,056
Poor devils.

That reminds me.

00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,066
What happened to the last pair

218
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,735
Hitomi brought back to Olumpos?

219
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,236
They were put in a SWAT team.

220
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,472
- As police officers,
they've been excellent,

221
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,775
but as people, they're
pretty goddamn weird.

- Excuse me.

223
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,448
Inspector General,
we've had confirmation

224
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,750
that it was AJ Sebastian.

225
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,618
- Again?

226
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:33,885
Goddamn him.

227
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,155
This man has got to be

Nike, what were their names?

The couple we were
talking about.

230
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:42,560
- She's Knute Dunan and
he's Bularios Hecatonchires,

231
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:43,762
both in SWAT.

232
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,929
- [Athena] Are they
good enough for the job?

233
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,832
- [Nike] You mean AJ Sebastian?

I would like to propose a
toast to the girl responsible

238
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:10,088
for saving us all from the
ruins of the world outside,

239
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,890
and indeed to all of us.

00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,566
from the ruins beyond Olumpos.

245
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,769
We owe an enormous debt
of gratitude to Hitomi.

246
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,604
When I think how Bularios
had been crippled

247
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:29,407
and blinded by the war and how
they managed to rebuild him,

248
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,877
give him a life
again, it's marvelous.

249
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,146
And when she comes back
from her expeditions,

250
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,848
she finds the time
to do casework

251
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,016
for the people she has saved

252
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,618
and helps them
settle into Olumpos.

253
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,854
But for her, we'd all
still be lost out there

00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,123
in that wasteland.

00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,366
Okay, the coast's clear.

331
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:23,302
- [Cop] You okay?

332
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:24,535
- [Karon] Yeah, I'm fine.

333
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,370
It's just the suit got
fucked in the firefight.

334
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,940
One of the bastards got
away onto the upper level.

335
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:29,941
- [Cop] Leave him to us.

336
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,509
- [Cop] See ya.

344

- Hello, Olumpos
Television news room.

345
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,533
Hey, it's that terrorist.

346
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:29,934
I'm sorry, go ahead, caller.

347
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,103
- Today, we in the
Human Liberation Union,

348
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,437
attacked the Tartarus block,

349
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,273
the headquarters
of the biodroids.

350
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:38,176
This action is intended
as a warning to them.

351
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,610
We would like to remind them

352
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:43,114
that they were created to serve
mankind, not to govern it.

353
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,315
They have risen to power

354
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:47,185
out of the chaos
caused by the last war.

355
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,587
They have no moral or
legal claim to government,

356
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:52,056
and we refuse to
recognize them as such.

357
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,859
We will continue to oppose them.

358
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,628
We have also recently come
by certain information

359
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,197
which tells us
that the biodroids

360
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,898
are going to deploy robot police

361
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,533
and heavily-armed
Multi-ped Cannons

362
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,636
in areas that they
consider to be volatile.

363
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,738
This is not the act
of a benign servant.

364
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,907
It is the act of a
dictator and oppressor.

365
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,542
It is clear to us the biodroids

366
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,211
intend to retain
their grasp on power

367
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,745
by every means available.

368
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,514
However, it is
still not too late.

369
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,317
We call on the human
population here to rise up

370
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,285
and shake off the
shackles of tyranny.

371
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,421
Freedom to humanity.

376
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,935
- Un-uh.

377
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,737
- Well, that's just the
usual sort of stupid bullshit

378
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,640
we've come to expect from
these crazy lunatics.

379
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,542
If only they were crazy.

380
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,410
That Sebastian is
up to something.

381
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,080
What the hell was he doing
in the Tartarus block?

[suspenseful music]

385
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,344
Was anything taken during the
raid on Tartarus last night?

386
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:21,280
- [Nike] Quite a lot.

387
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,913
Information retrieval, mainly.

388
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,915
Files on two
biodroids are missing.

389
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,250
Unfortunately, we're not sure

390
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:27,952
who they relate
to at the moment,

391
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,720
but the SSSP are investigating.

392
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,555
- [Athena] When do you
expect their report?

393
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:32,923
- [Nike] In three days.

394
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:35,593
On the plus side, the
incubation units were undamaged

395
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,695
and all current
fetuses remained valid.

396
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:40,698
The program's continuing
at full capacity.

- Oh.

00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:09,493
- [Cop] Golly.

403

[officer laughs]

404
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:13,031
- Holy shit, that thing
really kicks ass, huh?

405
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,500
- Look, Bularios,

406
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,803
about that attack on the
Tartarus block last night.

407
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:21,772
- Yeah, I know,
Sebastian was there.

408
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:24,041
If only we'd been on duty.

409
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:25,276
- Yeah.

410
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,711
- [Bularios] By the way,

411
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:28,813
I applied for transfer
to investigation as well.

412
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,081
- Oh, brilliant.

413
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,816
- And I figured if we
can't get a transfer,

414
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,352
then we'll take leave
and look for the bastard.

415

[engine hums]

417
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:42,159
- [Newsman] This prototype
version of the Multi-ped Cannon

418
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,528
has to be operated by
a technician on board.

419
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,764
But thanks to scientists
at the Olumpos Institute,

420
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,933
all that is set to become
a thing of the past.

421
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:51,369
Future production models
will be controlled by Gaia,

422
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,404
Olumpos' central supercomputer.

423
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:54,705
This means that no matter

424
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,841
where a Multi-ped
Cannon is located,

425
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,710
it'll be able to react as
part of a coordinated response

426
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,012
to terrorism wherever it occurs.

427
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,481
Now, as we've seen in the film,

428
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,783
that response is selective,
depending on the threat.

429
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,385
It ranges from heavy artillery

430
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,387
down to .50 millimeter,
laser-guided,

431
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,721
water-cooled machine guns.

Kieran.

433
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,891
- [Kieran] Well, I wouldn't
want to be on the receiving end

434
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,059
of that lot.

435
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,427
- [Newsman] Well, that's
all we've time for

436
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:17,695
from \"Tomorrow Today.\"

437
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,130
Next week-

438
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,765
- The prototype Multi-ped
is going to be moved

439
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,334
to the central magazine
at seven tomorrow,

440
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,503
so phase one is tonight.

this report stinks.

443
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:46,724
You got all, huh?

444
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,093
Oh.

445
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:53,864
So what the fuck
do they call this?

446
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:56,234
The Merry friggin' Celeste,
I shouldn't wonder.

447
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,937
Absent and this report
wants them in Central Admin,

448
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,439
my fucking life.
[phone rings]

449
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,440
Now what?

450
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:07,211
Yeah, this is Lieutenant
Bronx of the Olumpos SWAT.

451
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,313
Everyone's gone out the office,

452
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:12,116
Bularios, yeah, this is
his phone, but he's out.

[reception hums]

454
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,933
Well, the best I can suggest
is that you leave a message.

455
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,757
[reception beeps]

456
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:21,625
Jesus, yesterday, I
can't get rid of him,

457
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,828
today I can't find him.

458

[feet shuffling]

459
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:46,151
- See you guys later.
- Yeah, take it easy.

460
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,256
[feet shuffling]

461
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,426
- It's three days since we put
in our transfer applications

462
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:57,061
and we've heard nothing.

463
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,463
And nothing from the
terrorists either.

464
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:02,333
- Well as far as the transfers
are concerned, God knows.

465
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,002
But the Multi-ped Cannons are
due to be deployed shortly,

466
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,271
so the terrorists will
have to move soon.

467
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,139
There's no way they can
allow their deployment

468
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,641
to go unchecked.

469
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:11,510
- Yeah.

470
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:12,577
Hey.
- What's up?

471
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:15,779
- [Dunan] Karon.

472
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,915
- [Karon] Oh, hi there.

473
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:20,584
- I heard you got
injured the other night.

474
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:23,287
- That's right, just one
of those things, I suppose.

475
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,990
- Yeah, it was bad luck.

476
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,791
For Evans' grave?

477
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:30,027
- No, I've brought the
flowers from my wife.

478
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,196
She's also in this cemetery.

479
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,533
[somber music]

480
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,767
Thank you for coming.

481
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,703
She was always pleased
to get visitors.

482
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,674
You know, my wife's death
was the greatest tragedy

483
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:45,176
to have happened in my life.

484
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:49,313
- Did your wife
die in an accident?

485
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:50,548
- I'm afraid not.

486
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,383
She couldn't adapt to
her new life in Olumpos,

487
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,654
and so she became neurotic and
finally she killed herself.

488
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:58,022
- Oh.

489
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,423
- [Karon] Mind you,
I sometimes think

490
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,025
she had no real choice.

491
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,494
The city's organized
environment suffocated her.

492
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,796
In a way it was murder.

493
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:07,097
- How can you say that?

494
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:09,400
This city is the
most perfect place.

495
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,136
- I used to think that,
too, when I first came here.

496
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,572
Everything's provided for,
there's no unemployment,

497
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,974
there's proper healthcare,
housing, you name it,

498
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:18,776
we've got it, but
that's the problem.

499
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:21,178
We no longer live,
we just exist.

500
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:24,081
Living means fighting,
struggling for advancement.

501
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,383
It's a fundamental part
of the human condition.

502
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:28,786
You deny it, you
deny life itself.

503
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,554
That's what happened
to poor Fleia.

504
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:33,424
She had everything, but in
reality, she had nothing.

505
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,292
There was nothing
for her to live for,

506
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:36,694
nothing to strive for,

507
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,729
so she decided she couldn't
stand it any longer

508
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,132
and threw herself from
our apartment window.

509
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,336
I mean let's face it, we're
just living in a human zoo

510
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,538
with the Administration
as the keeper.

511
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:48,739
- That's not true.

512
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,841
You've got to admit most
people are happy here.

513
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:53,177
- That's because 80% of
the people in this city

514
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:55,613
are biodroids,
designed for life here.

515
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,780
They're programmed

516
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,716
to operate in this
environment from birth.

517
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,651
So it's no surprise,
they're happy.

Come on, let's go, hurry up.

00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,496
- [Karon] They're

in this environment from birth.

[solder gun hisses]

00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:10,854
- Hi.

534
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:11,855
Is it ready yet?

00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:14,325
- [sighs] Yeah, sure it's ready.

536
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:16,293
Just as you requested, right?

537
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:17,294
There.

538
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,865
As you said, I've made the
armor half-thickness all around.

539
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:22,867
- [Karon] Excellent.

540
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,172
- [Yoshi] I don't
want to tell you

541
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:28,439
your business or anything,

542
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,541
but you won't get much
protection from it now.

543
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,476
- [Karon] Yeah, I know.

544
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:33,010
- Well, okay, it's your funeral.

545
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,244
And believe me, it will be

546
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:36,313
if anybody uses armor
piercing bullets on you.

547
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,182

about gettin' blown away

548
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:39,717
by some asshole out there.

549
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,518
If I can get top speed
out of this suit,

550
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,488
I'll be too fast for anyone
to get a shot off at me.

551
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:47,291
- Oh, well, you know,
if your chief finds out,

552
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,459
you'll be in trouble.

553
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,461
This is completely
against all regulations.

554
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,596
- Just you forget
about the regulations.

555
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,065
Remember, I paid you cash
in hand for that job.

556
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,000
So just think about
how you'll spend it.

557
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:58,469
- Yeah.

558
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,830
- And anyway, it's like you
said, if I die, it's my funeral.

What's that?

You mean that one?

561
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:09,046
That's Dunan's new Guges.

562
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:10,481
She trashed her Landmate.

563
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:11,882
She's pretty hard on Landmates,

564
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,884
so I persuaded her to
buy this Guges model.

565
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,385
It's much more
expensive, of course,

566
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:17,421
but it's a lot tougher
and better made.

But then again, I bet she wrecks
it within a week. [laughs]

00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:24,361
She'll be a strong opponent.

Now I'll come straight to the
point as my time is precious.

You will find this
terrorist, Sebastian,

588
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,018
and then I want you to kill him.

589
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,989
I want you to understand that
this man's not to be arrested.

00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,091

contravenes section 38

591

of the Olympion Freedom Charter.

592
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:05,395
- That's true, but
Sebastian is a special case

593
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:08,532
and we must employ special
measures if we are to stop him.

00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,967
I have chosen you
two for the task,

taken a particular interest

in the case.

Sebastian will be made available

for you to inspect.

00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:19,109
You will give this case
the highest priority.

until Sebastian is dead.

00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:47,324
- Excellent, after tonight,

650
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:48,625
I'll have the Multi-ped Cannon

651
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,027
and you'll have the girl.

652
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,029
You know where to take her?
- Yes.

653
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,230
- [AJ] Good.

654
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,398
It's unfortunate
these two cops live

655
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,999
in the same block as Hitomi.

656
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,601
You'll take care of them.

657
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,036
- Don't worry, I
won't let Bularios

658
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,238
and Dunan get in the way.

659
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:03,907
I'll take them out

you, my friend.

674

675
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:59,029
to Bularios Hecatonchires
and Dunan Knute, and quick.

behind our backs,

which is a great pity when
you consider all the effort

that we put in.

690

relax safe in the knowledge

691
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:29,126
that he's not gonna tell
anyone anything anymore.

692

Running this bar on the
huge profits he made

693
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,597
obviously wasn't enough for him.

694
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:36,367
I guess he needed the extra

but for the record
I'm Sebastian.

how have you been?

Sorry I'm not transmitting
picture, but I wouldn't-

712
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:39,597
- Nereus!

713
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:41,298
- [Nereus] Into the wrong hands.

Listen, I've got some really

but it'll cost ya. [cackles]

- But then when doesn't it?
- Who is it?

717
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:49,506
- It's Nereus, my
old tip-off man,

718
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:50,874
but he's been out
of crime too long

719
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,143
to hear anything
about anyone now.

720
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:55,212
- [Nereus] I think you'll
find it's worth hearing.

721
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,581
I'll wait for you at my
place, the Bar Nereus.

Just in case you can't remember,

haven't heard from you.

729
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,540
It's most unlike you to let
an opportunity like this

730
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,008
slip through your fingers.

731

Perhaps you think
I'm bullshitting you.

I tell you something.

furthermore, I know who.

736
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,687
So if you want to find out who
the traitor in your midst is,

00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:39,990
you'd better get
yourself down here now.

the engineer,

I repeat, I got the tag.

Gaia, the Central computer'll

00:42:58,108 --> 00:42:59,709

What you probably don't know

835
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:04,514
is that there is
an override key.

836
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:06,883
It's built into Hitomi's DNA.

837
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:09,419
That key is now in the
hands of the terrorists.

838
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,920
You realize they
now have the power

to shut down the entire city.

consequences might be.

We've got to get her back.

- [Bularios] We understand
the situation is serious,

844
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:22,565
but why were we arrested?

845
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:25,468
- You've been arrested on
suspicion of being spies.

846
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:26,603
- No way.

847

[Dunan huffs]

848
00:43:27,539 --> 00:43:28,938
- We have, for some time,

849
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,940
been aware that there's a
security leak within the police.

850
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,709
Unfortunately, we
have been unsuccessful

851
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,744
in positively identifying
the guilty parties,

852
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:36,412
however, we suspect you both.

853
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:39,148
Let us not forget that the
Sebastian was able to escape

854
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:41,284
from your custody without
any apparent problem

855
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,885
during the Tower block siege.

856
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:44,954
Now either he's very clever,

857
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:48,191
or else he didn't so much escape
from you as walk scot-free,

858
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:49,826
which can only mean one thing.

859
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:51,594
You are terrorist sympathizers,

860
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:53,496
and as you were not
born in Olumpos-

861
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:56,032
- Why you, you, you
know, that's not true.

862
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:57,867
We've always served the city.

863
00:43:57,868 --> 00:43:59,369
- Yes, that's true.

864
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,304
It will be the perfect
cover for your subterfuge.

865
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,373
In addition, when
Hitomi was kidnapped,

866
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,908
you two were on the scene
and the terrorist escaped.

867
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:08,044
- That's because your
men had us arrested.

868
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:09,746
They were obeying their orders

869
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:12,382
and you prevented them
firing on the suspect.

870
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:15,451
- But Hitomi could easily have
been killed in their fire.

871
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:17,687
- We can make Hitomi's
replica any time.

872
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:20,256
It would be better if she were
dead, then let them have her.

873
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:21,991
- But that's worse than murder.

874
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,226
- Don't be ridiculous.

875

She's a biodroid,

- It's just as well the girl's
your friend and not mine

884
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,216
because Hitomi's still in the
clutches of those terrorists,

885
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:49,218
and dead or alive, we need her.

from an old informant of mine.

889

If you'll just give us a
chance to follow it up,

00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:58,895
you'll see your trust
in us is justified.

anyone know who it was?

- Dead men can't talk.

us the most important thing,

00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,381
that they're being assisted
by a member of the police.

- What do you suppose
they're going to do?

- I ain't got a clue,

but I'm prepared to bet
good odds it's gonna be big,

and there's gonna be one hell
of a lot of shootin' involved.

to defend the city against an

Excellent, now
there's only one place

00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:50,399
we're from the Olympion
Mental Institute.

940

We'd like to ask some
questions about your late wife.

941
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:54,971
- As you will be aware,

942
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:57,106
your wife made frequent
trips to the Institute

943
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:58,107
before her death.

944
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,212
- Undoubtedly, her sanity
had been disturbed.

945
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:06,116
We would like you to tell us
what caused that disturbance.

946
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:11,955
- Anything might help us,
whatever you can remember.

We must help you then.

Hey, get off me.

You have no right.
- Quiet, Mr. Mausoros.

Answer me, damn you.

me from my home.

It's time for us to get going.

- No way will I
ever help terrorists

977
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:29,599
to destroy the city
of Olumpos. [gasps]

978
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,201
Stay away from me.

979
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:34,503
Remember, I'm a biodroid
and we can't do anything

980
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:37,341
that could possibly harm
our beautiful environment.

981
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:41,610
- Hitomi, I'm not asking
you as a biodroid,

982
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:43,579
I'm asking you as a human being.

[feet pounding]

Look, there's Karon.

990
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:17,613
- Huh?

991
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:19,482
- Hi, I've got an extra
Landmate to deliver.

992
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:21,283
Here are the papers.

993
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:22,285
- [Dunan] Hi, Karon.

994

[Hitomi gasps]

995

that's all in order.

1002
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,409
- [Nereus] This case
involves a policeman.

1005
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,614
Come on.

- All right, get movin'.

1010
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:04,194
- [Cop] You, contact
headquarters.

1011
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:06,296
- [Dunan] What the
hell's goin' on?

1012
00:51:06,297 --> 00:51:08,030
- I heard, Hitomi in that truck.

1013
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:09,398
- [Dunan] What?

1014
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:10,633
- Remember, we're lookin'
for a crooked cop.

1015
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:11,667
- What?

1016
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:13,069
You can't mean Karon.

1017
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,470
I don't believe it.

1018
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:16,473
- We know he thinks
Olumpos murdered his wife.

00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,734
Or is it possible you've got us?

[air whooshes]

00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:06,515
[helicopter blades hum]

1047
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:07,850
- [Dunan] Karon.

1048
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:10,553
- Listen, you have
to get out of my way.

1049
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:12,121
- We can't do that.

1050
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:13,056
- [Karon] You have to.

1051
00:53:13,057 --> 00:53:14,456
Don't you realize

1052
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:16,458
if the remote-control
Multi-ped Cannons come online,

1053
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:18,727
they can only be
operated by Gaia?

1054
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:21,297
That means the entire planet
will be under its control.

1055
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:23,299
Humans will no longer
control their destiny.

1056
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,201
- Where are the gunships?

1057
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,604
- [Officer] We'll be with
you as soon as we can.

1058
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,139
- What can we expect
if he succeeds

1059
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,707
in taking Gaia out of service?

1060
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,008
- It'd be a total fuck up.

1061
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:34,343
Everything would go offline.

1062
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:35,711
Shit.
- What is it?

1063
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,913
- I think I know what
the bastards are up to.

1064
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:39,348
When Gaia goes offline,

1065
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:41,183
the only thing that would
still be operational

1066
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:42,651
is the prototype
Multi-ped Cannon.

1067
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:44,620
And if that were to fall
into the wrong hands,

1068
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:45,955
we would be
defenseless against it.

1069
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:47,990
- [Dunan] Surrender now, Karon.

1070
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:48,925
- [Karon] Never.

1071
00:53:48,926 --> 00:53:50,359
I won't tell you two again.

1072
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,894
You'll have to
kill me to stop me.

1073
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:52,829
- Huh?

1074
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,463
- I can't let Olumpos survive.

1075
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:56,632
It treats us like

in there, Hitomi.

- Oh, please.

1088

This is a red alert.

to the city's communal

Quick, call out the air team.

- Right, well do what you can.

1117
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,230
We'll go to Gaia and
get its functions back.

1118

- Gaia, ma'am?

- Right.

make it in time.

- You can't just walk in there.

1129
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,837
Gaia has defensive systems

1131

It'll kill you.

and the only thing that can stop

1137
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:01,083
that Multi-ped Cannon is Gaia.

1138
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,820
So somehow we have to find
a way of getting it back on.

- [Athena] No, these are just
some of Gaia's data banks.

1158
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:03,412
We need to get to the ROM drive
at the center of this lot.

1159
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:06,348
It's the bit that uses all
the information stored here.

1160
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:07,616
We'll have to be careful though,

1161
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:10,052
because it's defended by

Okay, let's move it.

Our best chance
is to keep moving.

1166
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:21,029
It makes us a harder target

we're still about
20 minutes away.

200 meters of passage to go.

have to run it alone.

1182
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:03,939
I'll cover you from back here.

1183
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,541
Now get moving.

1184
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,309
- Bularios!

1185
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,011
- Look, don't argue,
just get on with it.

1186
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:10,646
My leg's completely fucked.

There's no way I'd ever make it.

Look, I'll tell you what.

1189

When this is over, you can
take me shopping for a new leg.

- Uh-huh.

1191
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:20,656
- [Bularios] Now don't stop.

1192
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:23,226
Just keep going straight
and don't even look, okay?

That circuit is responsible

All we have to do is break it.

And that's going to be your job.
