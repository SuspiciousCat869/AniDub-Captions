Can you tell me?

there was a man there

named Acier Myskina who
was researching ways

to refine metal.

And that it's valuable enough
to buy everything in the world.

searched for the Pure Gold

stories originated.

treasure is also rumored

to face a terrifying fate.

sounds like a big deal!

And no one has ever
been able to find it?

00:18:59.634 --> 00:19:02.200 position:13% line:83% align:start
And it can buy everything
in the entire world?

00:19:02.234 --> 00:19:04.100 position:24% line:89% align:start
Like, everything?

01:31:35.534 --> 01:31:38.334 position:27% line:83% align:start
So you would do
anything to have it.

01:31:38.367 --> 01:31:41.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
What if that means
sacrificing a friend?!

01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:43.434 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do you just give up and go home?

01:31:43.467 --> 01:31:45.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
Because the treasure
goes to the ones

01:31:45.534 --> 01:31:47.701 position:27% line:83% align:start
who will stop at
nothing to get it!

01:31:48.534 --> 01:31:52.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sacrificing a friend
is giving up.

01:31:52.367 --> 01:31:57.133 position:13% line:83% align:start
I won't lose... because I

I'm going to have them all.

You what?!

01:32:04.501 --> 01:32:05.501 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're no hero!

Treasure into its side

01:33:48.667 --> 01:33:50.300 position:7% line:89% align:start
must have been the last straw!

Oh, I get it, Olga, you
were able to get out

01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:55.100 position:7% line:83% align:start
of his stomach the first time
'cause of puke power, huh?

I wouldn't use those
exact words, but yeah.

you get out of a fish!

01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:02.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
[BROOK] Look! Why, there's
hardly a scratch on us!

01:35:02.767 --> 01:35:05.200 position:16% line:83% align:start
[CHOPPER] No one's flesh
melted off or anything!

01:35:05.234 --> 01:35:08.367 position:10% line:83% align:start

didn't have flesh to begin with.

01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:12.367 position:5% line:83% align:start

that light is Pure Gold, too!

01:35:23.801 --> 01:35:27.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yes. It's the largest
piece in the world.

[CREW]
What?!

simply can't eat enough of it.

01:35:35.467 --> 01:35:37.567 position:21% line:83% align:start
And after it's been
digested in his stomach,

01:35:37.601 --> 01:35:41.334 position:10% line:83% align:start
it builds up in his lantern,
shining brighter and brighter.

01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:44.734 position:10% line:83% align:start
[ROBIN] "Whoever obtains the
treasure

01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:49.801 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, we were eaten alive.

01:35:49.834 --> 01:35:53.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
That is terrifying,
but it was also pretty fun.

01:35:54.334 --> 01:35:58.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
[ACIER] A strange feeling,
watching my home swim away.

01:35:58.467 --> 01:36:00.300 position:19% line:83% align:start
If we don't tempt him
with Pure Gold,

01:36:00.334 --> 01:36:04.400 position:13% line:83% align:start
we'll never see him again,
for better or for worse.

01:36:04.434 --> 01:36:06.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
Seeing as I'm the only
one who knows how to make it,

01:36:06.801 --> 01:36:10.000 position:24% line:83% align:start
I suppose this is
our final farewell.

01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:14.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
[ACIER] And our final

01:36:42.234 --> 01:36:45.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
[ACIER] Well, this has

Thank you for everything you've
done for the both of us.

Yeah, you guys aren't so bad.

01:36:50.701 --> 01:36:53.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wish I could say this
all turned out for the best.

01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:55.434 position:10% line:83% align:start
But you lost your ring when
Bonbori swallowed us,

01:36:55.467 --> 01:36:57.133 position:33% line:89% align:start
didn't you?

01:36:57.167 --> 01:37:00.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
I hate to be a downer,
but what about your illness?

01:37:00.267 --> 01:37:04.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
Eh, I'm fine. I've lived
for long enough anyway.

01:37:04.133 --> 01:37:06.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
Besides, if I have to get
swallowed by that fish again,

01:37:06.601 --> 01:37:09.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'd rather stay
out here and die.

01:37:21.267 --> 01:37:23.334 position:10% line:89% align:start
No! I think you're confused!

01:37:23.367 --> 01:37:25.701 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's totally easy to cure!

01:37:25.734 --> 01:37:26.767 position:41% line:89% align:start

Heh?

01:37:27.968 --> 01:37:31.667 position:10% line:83% align:start

Are you sure about that?

Hah! Amazing what can happen

You're not gonna die
on my watch, Olga!

[ACIER] There's no need

Even if things didn't work out
exactly how I planned,

01:38:01.667 --> 01:38:07.567 position:10% line:83% align:start
both Pure Gold and those 200

[ACIER]
We're finally free,

01:38:30.534 --> 01:38:33.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
but what should we
do with ourselves now?

01:38:33.067 --> 01:38:35.534 position:13% line:83% align:start
[OLGA] We can do whatever
the heck we want.

I took care of
myself for centuries.

I think we'll be just fine.

got my little girl with me,

01:38:45.367 --> 01:38:46.667 position:24% line:89% align:start

You're right, I am little.

We ended up empty-handed again.

01:39:31.767 --> 01:39:34.234 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, what is it?

01:39:34.267 --> 01:39:37.300 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
An invitation to Gran Tesoro!

01:39:37.334 --> 01:39:39.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
With a Vivre Card
to get us there.

01:39:39.501 --> 01:39:42.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sounds cool! But what's
a Gran Tesoro anyway?

01:39:42.367 --> 01:39:44.567 position:13% line:89% align:start
A golden city on the sea!

01:39:44.601 --> 01:39:47.334 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's the biggest entertainment
center in the world!

01:39:47.367 --> 01:39:50.601 position:13% line:83% align:start
They've got a huge casino
and luxury hotels.

01:39:50.634 --> 01:39:55.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
Food and shopping and fun
as far as the eye can see!

01:39:55.334 --> 01:39:57.133 position:30% line:89% align:start
Gambling, huh?

01:39:57.167 --> 01:39:59.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
We'll see how their
food stacks up to mine.

01:39:59.767 --> 01:40:02.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
Their architecture
must be fascinating!

01:40:02.334 --> 01:40:04.601 position:13% line:83% align:start
They probably have amazing
concerts to see, as well!

01:40:04.634 --> 01:40:07.767 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, you think they have a ferris
wheel like an amusement park?!

01:40:07.801 --> 01:40:10.367 position:13% line:89% align:start
Come on, Luffy! Let's go!

01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:13.067 position:27% line:89% align:start
[LUFFY chuckles]

01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:15.100 position:19% line:89% align:start
No complaints from me!

01:40:15.133 --> 01:40:17.367 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Well, it's settled, then!

01:40:18.834 --> 01:40:20.234 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Gran Tesoro...

01:40:20.267 --> 01:40:23.367 position:21% line:89% align:start
Here... we... come!

01:41:59.367 --> 01:42:01.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AIGIS] Although we
were unable to stop him,

01:42:01.234 --> 01:42:03.601 position:13% line:83% align:start
it seems that Mad Treasure
failed to acquire

01:42:03.634 --> 01:42:05.300 position:30% line:89% align:start
the Pure Gold.

01:42:05.334 --> 01:42:08.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
Both he and it have
disappeared into the sea.

01:42:08.267 --> 01:42:10.601 position:10% line:89% align:start
Should we pursue it further?

01:42:10.634 --> 01:42:13.267 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUCCI]
No. That won't be necessary.

01:42:14.434 --> 01:42:18.467 position:7% line:83% align:start
[LUCCI] Better to maintain the
balance of the world, I think.

01:42:18.501 --> 01:42:20.067 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AIGIS]
Sir.

01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:22.667 position:10% line:83% align:start
[LUCCI] I'm more interested
in Treasure's employer.

01:42:22.701 --> 01:42:24.434 position:19% line:89% align:start
I have my suspicions,

01:42:24.467 --> 01:42:27.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
but were you able
to confirm his identity?

01:42:27.501 --> 01:42:28.400 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AIGIS]
Yes, sir.

01:42:28.434 --> 01:42:32.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
As I'm sure you've
guessed... it's Tesoro.

01:42:35.234 --> 01:42:37.601 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUCCI]
Gild Tesoro...

01:42:40.067 --> 01:42:43.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
[LUCCI] We might have
to do something about him.

01:42:44.634 --> 01:42:48.234 position:24% line:89% align:start
Sururururururu...

01:42:48.267 --> 01:42:51.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
Mad Treasure fell short
of his lofty reputation.

01:42:51.834 --> 01:42:53.801 position:27% line:83% align:start
He suffered some
manner of defeat

01:42:53.834 --> 01:42:56.634 position:5% line:89% align:start
and is now nowhere to be found.

01:42:56.667 --> 01:42:58.634 position:33% line:89% align:start
What a pity.

01:42:58.667 --> 01:43:02.300 position:30% line:83% align:start
I must admit,
I expected better of him.

01:43:02.334 --> 01:43:04.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
[TESORO chuckles]
Whatever happened,

01:43:04.667 --> 01:43:06.667 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry I missed the show.

01:43:06.701 --> 01:43:10.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
That must have been
some real entertainment.

01:43:10.367 --> 01:43:12.100 position:19% line:89% align:start
You know who beat him?

01:43:12.133 --> 01:43:16.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
Ah... forgive me, my lord,
but that is a mystery.

01:43:16.467 --> 01:43:20.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
[TESORO] Hmm... Well.
It doesn't matter.

01:43:20.801 --> 01:43:24.567 position:10% line:83% align:start
We can hire someone else if
we want the treasure that badly.

01:43:24.601 --> 01:43:27.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
We've already got plenty
of gold to play with.

01:43:27.133 --> 01:43:30.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
And anyone will bow down
for the right price.

01:43:30.801 --> 01:43:34.334 position:24% line:89% align:start
[TESORO chuckles]

01:43:35.534 --> 01:43:38.701 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

01:43:44.767 --> 01:43:48.234 position:38% line:89% align:start
