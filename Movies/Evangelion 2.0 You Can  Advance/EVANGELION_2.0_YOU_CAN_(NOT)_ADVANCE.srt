I'll go with Japanese,

[Kaji] I'm sorry the new plug suits
 weren't ready.

11
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,032
My boobs are getting squished flat
in this thing!

12

[Kaji] And on top of that,
 I'm sorry we're sending you into battle

in a half-finished Eva.

No worries, I'm just happy to be piloting.
At last!

[Kaji] Being a troublemaker held you back.
 But it's up to you now.

16
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,838
We're ready to roll! I can't believe it!

Awesome! My heart's pounding!

OK! Evangelion Provisional Unit Five,
activate!

Defend the Limbo Area at all costs!

We cannot allow it
to escape from Acheron!

21
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:59,620
How could a containment system
as secure as Cocytus be neutralised?

22
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:02,540
We knew it was something
that could happen.

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,124
- Hmm?
- On its own,

24
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:07,503
humanity is completely
incapable of keeping the Angels at bay.

25
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:11,090
The Third Angel
was excavated from the permafrost.

26
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,801
The dissections and experiments
were so extensive

27
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,970
that all that's left now
are some bones.

28
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:18,347
That's how we arrived
at those conclusions.

Well, I'm off. Gotta run.

This Eva's falling apart!

The limbs were just thrown together

Oh, why didn't anyone tell me syncing

Well, I'm alive,
so at least there's that.

But I feel bad about using adults

Well, adios, Eva Unit Five.
Thank you for your service.

[Gendoh] The last time we came here
together was three years ago.

[Shinji] The last time I came here was...
when I ran away.

I still can't believe that's Mom
in there.

I can't even remember her face.

71
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:19,630
You must be able to forget,
if you are to go on living.

72
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,966
But there are some things
you must never forget.

73
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:26,428
It's an important lesson
that Yui taught me.

74
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,848
I come here to remind myself of that.

75
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,226
Do you have a picture of Mom?

76
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,145
No, I don't have anything.

77
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,648
Even this grave is just for show.

78
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,566
There is nothing in there.

79
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,487
So you really threw everything away.
Others told me that before.

80
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,989
[Gendoh] What's important
is what you keep inside.

81
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:48,450
This will have to do for now.

82
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,333
It's time. I'll be going now.

00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,971
Father, thanks for coming today.

85
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,140
I was happy to talk to you.

00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:13,517
Right.

87
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,978
So, you see, Shinji!
I know you were nervous about today.

88
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,022
But it wasn't so bad,
meeting your father here!

89
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:05,444
It sure beats staying at home
and just moping around, right?

90
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,863
At least you paid
your respects to your mom.

91
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,699
I only came because you made me,
Ms Misato.

92
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:14,369
Come on! I think you came because
deep down, you wanted to come!

93
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:16,580
Be honest with yourself.

94
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,208
Being honest only brings pain and misery.

95
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,835
You came through for us
just when we needed you most

96
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,003
and saved everyone.

97
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,838
You should be a little more confident.

98
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,969
Be proud of yourself.
I'm sure your father is proud of you too.

99
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:34,014
- [phone rings]
- Katsuragi here.

100
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,768
Whoa!

101
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,436
Whoa!

102
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,687
What did you just say?

103
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,718
[man] The Seventh Angel
 has been spotted in Sagami Bay.

104
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,762
The second army group
 is engaging the enemy.

105
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:16,556
A state of emergency was declared
 three minutes ago.

106
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,519
[Misato] I have direct visual contact!
Currently en route with Unit One pilot.

107
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,855
Start Task 03.
Prioritize deployment of Unit Zero!

108
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:26,566
[Hyuga] Actually,
 we have task 02 already started.

109
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,527
Task 02? Is that... ?

110
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:37,911
It is Unit Two!

111
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:17,034
- The core was destroyed in one shot!
- No, not quite! It's a decoy!

112
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,262
[battle cry]

113
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,124
Aaah!

114
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,881
[Misato] Engagement complete.

115
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,884
[operator woman] Affected areas
 have been fully sealed off.

116
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:22,224
Eva Unit Two is currently being
 transported via Sagami Mainline N.1.

117
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:25,894
[Tohji] Whoa! So Eva Unit Two is red?
That's really cool.

118
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,480
[Asuka] And that's not the only thing
that makes it special.

119
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,982
- [all] Huh?
- After all, Unit Zero is a prototype,

120
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,735
while Unit One is just a test bed Eva.

121
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,695
But Unit Two is different.

122
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:39,116
This is the world's first true
Evangelion that was built for combat

123
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,202
and officially approved
for combat duty!

124
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,537
- Oh!
- Let me introduce her.

125
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,624
This is Euro Air Force's ace pilot,
Captain Asuka Shikinami Langley.

126
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,086
The second child
and official pilot of Eva Unit Two.

127
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,549
Long time no see, Misato! Hmm.

128
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,138
So that's the commander's pet,
who got to pilot Unit Zero?

129
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:06,977
Now, which one you rode on his father's
coattails to become an Eva pilot?

130
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:09,729
Hmm.

131
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,023
You're an idiot, aren't you?

132
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:17,154
You were supposed to defend your city!
Bah! Absolutely irresponsible!

133
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,823
And totally unprepared, I see!

134
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,494
You should be ashamed of yourself,
neglecting your duty as a pilot!

135
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,456
You're just coattail-riding, aren't you?

136
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,127
Give me a break!
Who does she think she is?

137
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,920
What's that girl's deal?

138
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,841
[Kensuke] Well, you got to hand it to her.
Already a captain at our age!

139
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,968
That's awesome! What a girl!

140
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,179
And she's already graduated from college,
right?

141
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,763
- [Kaji] Excuse me.
- Huh?

142
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:47,726
Is this the gate where I can catch
a transport to the Geofront hub terminal?

143
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:51,313
Um, yes, sir. But you'll need to
change trains four stops from here.

144
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:56,943
Hmm. I leave for two years and
I already feel like Rip Van Winkle!

145
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,987
Thanks a bunch. I appreciate it.

146
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,073
Where's Katsuragi,
and why is she not with you?

147
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:05,368
- Huh?
- She's an old friend of mine.

148
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:08,747
So you're not the only one who knows
what she wears to sleep at night,

149
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,207
Mr Shinji Ikari.

150
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:18,632
- You know what she wears to sleep?
- What is with that guy?

151
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,092
I gotta say,
that mission was quite interesting.

152
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:24,513
This little accident solved our problem
with the Third Angel,

153
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:27,933
and with Eva Unit Five
all in one fell swoop.

154
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:31,478
Their loss is a major setback
for the Marduk Plan at Bethany Base.

155
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:34,189
All proceeding
according to your scenario.

156
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,983
And I submitted
my latest report on SEELE.

157
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:39,152
Yes, we've already read it.

158
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:42,364
Thank you for the intel on
the construction of the Mark Six.

159
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:46,493
My pleasure, sir. And here is what
I promised to bring back.

160
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,204
The lost number
kept in storage as a spare.

161
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,669
The guidepost
that will unite soul and God.

162
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,964
[Gendoh] Right. This will open
the gates of Human Instrumentality.

163
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,175
The Key of Nebuchadnezzar.

164
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,678
My work here is done.
Now, if you don't mind,

165
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,721
I'll take a little personal time.

166
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,728
Chief Inspection Officer Ryoji Kaji.

167
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,022
Do you think
this young man can be trusted?

168
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,824
Did you lose a little weight?
Huh, Ritsuko?

169
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:29,452
I haven't. Actually I've gained
three and a half pounds.

170
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,788
I'd like to check that myself, if I may.

171
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,666
You're welcome to. But you should
know my lab is monitored.

172
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:38,628
Don't worry about it. I set up
a fake video loop of you working.

173
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,922
You're always
two steps ahead of everybody.

174
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:43,216
What can I say? I do not like to lose.

175
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,927
- You've lost this battle.
- Huh?

176
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:48,805
There's a very angry lady
looking right at us.

177
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:54,561
- Dear Ryoji, it's been a while.
- It has. Far too long.

178
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:58,189
[Misato] What are you doing here?
You're assigned to the Euro Branch!

179
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:01,109
Special assignment.
I'll be here at HQ for a while.

180
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:04,237
We can all hang together again,
just like we did in college.

181
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:07,198
No! I'm not interested
in reliving the past!

182
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:11,995
I came to talk to Ritsuko about work!
Asuka's transfer has been finalized by HR.

183
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,079
Bye!

184
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,959
Misato hasn't been that jealous in ages.

185
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:20,128
You know,
you still have a shot with her.

186
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,255
Thanks, Ritsuko. But I'm not so sure.

187
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,930
Asuka Shikinami.

188
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:35,310
Apparently,
some people enjoy being an Eva pilot.

189
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,437
I'm home!

190
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,272
What's all this stuff?

191
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:43,902
- What happened to my room?
- [Asuka] Don't be rude!

192
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:47,614
- These are my personal belongings!
- Then where's... my stuff?

193
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,116
What are you doing here?
What does this mean?

194
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,201
[sighs]

195
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,244
- You're an idiot, aren't you?
- Huh?

196
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:57,290
What it means, is that
you have been fired. As you should!

197
00:15:57,374 --> 00:16:00,251
I'm a way better Eva pilot
than you can ever hope to be.

198
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:01,961
Are you serious?

199
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:05,882
I can't believe how small and cramped
the rooms are in Japanese housing.

200
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,510
I could only fit half of my boxes in here!

201
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:12,764
And you people seem to have zero respect
for privacy, or even basic security.

202
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:17,727
I can't imagine living in a house where
doors don't lock, and anybody can open!

203
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,187
- Aaah!
- Well, Japanese people

204
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,439
value trying to be
considerate of others.

205
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:24,943
- Ah, Ms Misato!
- Boy, oh, boy, you're annoying!

206
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,821
- Now take your crap and get outta here!
- Oh, not at all.

207
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,323
- Shinji is staying right here with you.
- What?

208
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:34,577
Yes, you and Shinji desperately need to
learn how to get along with one another.

209
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,162
You're both Eva pilots.

210
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:39,749
Living together will help you
work together. That is an order.

211
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,294
We'll have so much fun together!

212
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,314
[Misato] Ready? Now all together.

213
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,567
[both] Thank you for the delicious meal!

214
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,072
Ayee!

215
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:15,118
Oh, man, nothing better than a nice
hot bath and a cold beer chaser!

216
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:19,456
Aaah! There's something in the bathroom!
It's a wild animal!

217
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,170
It's a bird, called a penguin.
His name is Pen-Pen.

218
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,546
I... Ugh!

219
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:28,798
Hmm?

220
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:30,717
Oh! Oh!

221
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,387
[battle cry]

222
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,639
Aaah!

223
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,559
You're such a pervert!
You're a stupid, sex-crazed idiot!

224
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,020
They're getting more familiar
around each other.

225
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,439
That's a good sign. Isn't it, Pen-Pen?

226
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:55,283
[snoring]

227
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:02,332
You're not like all of these idiots.
I'm so happy for you, Asuka.

228
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,585
You're very special.
So, just like every other time,

229
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:09,047
you can only count on yourself, Asuka.

230
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,680
[sighs]

231
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:21,017
[ring tone]

232
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,822
Why won't you answer the phone,
Father?

233
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:36,658
[bird song]

234
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:01,576
- A social studies field trip? With Kaji?
- Yes.

235
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,329
- He wanted everybody to come along.
- Oh, yuck!

236
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,247
Nothing good comes
from hanging out with him!

237
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,416
[Asuka] OK, well, then I'm gonna pass!

238
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:11,669
No, you won't! You're not gonna pass
on a trip with your class!

239
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:15,131
- That would be kinda crass!
- Is that another order?

240
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:25,934
[Fuyutsuki] We've come all the way
to the moon to see Tabgha base

241
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:28,478
and they deny us permission to land?

242
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,481
SEELE are as petty
as they are ruthless.

243
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:35,318
[Gendoh] It's clear Mark Six is built
on a completely different concept.

244
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,320
That fact alone was worth the trip.

245
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:41,658
I thought Unit Five was supposed to be
the very last Eva ever built.

246
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:45,995
Parts of the Dead Sea Scrolls Apocrypha
remain under lock and key.

247
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,791
SEELE must proceeding with their scenario
based on that information.

248
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,336
[Fuyutsuki] But by now,
SEELE must have some kind of knowledge

249
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,964
of NERV's ultimate goal, don't you think?

250
00:20:56,047 --> 00:21:00,677
Yes, it's possible they do. But that
won't stop us from doing what we must do.

251
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,056
Even if it means opposing God's Logos
to make sure the plan succeeds.

252
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,480
A boy? That's impossible.

253
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:16,651
Nice to finally meet you, Father.

254
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,613
[Kensuke] Awesome! This is so awesome!

255
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:23,116
They're reviving and preserving
the marine life we lost

256
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,868
and returning the red oceans
back to their original state!

257
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:28,079
This is a real sanctuary,
closed to visitors,

258
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,331
where visionary men do God's work!

259
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:33,418
I can't believe we're getting a tour,
even if it's only of a small part!

260
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,712
Wow! It's good to have friends
in high places!

261
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,089
Thanks, man, we really appreciate this!

262
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,883
You're welcome,
but it's Mr Kaji you should thank.

263
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,678
[Kaji] OK, guys,
here's where things get a little messy.

264
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:44,554
Huh?

265
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,147
[all] Hot, hot, hot!

266
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,570
[all] Cold, cold, cold!

267
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,534
Aaah!

268
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,662
Let me out! I promise I'm clean, now!

269
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:21,049
Woohoo! Check out this gigantic aquarium!

270
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:23,509
[laughs]

271
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:27,430
[Shinji] These are all life forms
from before the Second Impact?

272
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,775
There's just so much life!

273
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,069
Awesome... Just totally awesome!

274
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:44,322
Check out these things!
They look like a boulder with legs!

275
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:48,367
- I think they're called turtles!
- All running around like stupid kids.

276
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:50,119
- What a bunch of idiots!
- Wow!

277
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:03,800
[Shinji] I'm glad you could come with us.
Are you OK, today?

278
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:07,595
[Rei] Yes. I finished my assignments.

279
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:11,682
- It's so cramped in there!
- Hmm. That's too bad.

280
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:14,393
They'd be way better off
out in the open sea.

281
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:18,815
They can't. These animals can
only survive here, inside their tanks.

282
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,400
They're like me that way.

283
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,161
[all] It's lunch time!

284
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,706
- Aaah!
- It's actually good! I can't believe it!

285
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,709
Yeah, Shinji. Everything is
perfectly cooked and seasoned.

286
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,880
How did you make meat
that's 90% artificial taste so good?

287
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:45,341
Who knew you were such a chef, Shinji.

288
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,884
This is delicious!

289
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:50,555
I have no choice.
Misato only uses her microwave.

290
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,306
I had to learn
how to make real food.

291
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:55,143
You won't regret it.
Women love men who know how to cook.

292
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,727
Listen and learn!

293
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:59,772
No way I'm learning how to cook!
Real men avoid kitchens!

294
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:02,692
What millennium are you from?
Idiot Tohji!

295
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,986
What did you say?
Real men gotta have principles!

296
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:07,321
- You're even dumber than you look.
- What did you say?

297
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:09,365
Just calm down and eat, please.

298
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:16,581
Sorry, Ayanami.
You don't like what I made?

299
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:19,584
It's not that.
It's just that I don't eat meat.

300
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,628
[Asuka] Stupid Japanese,
apologizing all the time!

301
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:26,299
And you, lil' Miss Veggie! All living
beings eat other living beings.

302
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:30,386
If you care about the animals
in your meal, don't let them go to waste!

303
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,973
What? You want a fight?

304
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:38,769
Don't worry!

305
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:40,938
I'll get rid of that for you!

306
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:43,691
Hey! I called dibs on that!

307
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:46,277
Do you know the phrase "eat like a bird"?
Go away!

308
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,071
- Bird brain!
- Bunch of idiots!

309
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,823
[Tohji] I'm bigger than you!

310
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:52,950
How about some Miso soup?

311
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,039
It'll warm you up.

312
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:10,551
Delicious.

313
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:16,682
This is how Mother Earth looks now?
It breaks my heart to see her this way.

314
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:21,312
[Gendoh] Yes, but some people
actually wanted this outcome.

315
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:25,942
A pristine world,
untainted by the original sin,

316
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,152
where no man may ever set foot.

317
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:32,865
Well I, for one, prefer a chaotic world.
A world that has been soiled by man.

318
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:35,534
Chaos is in the eye of the beholder.

319
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:39,038
The world is always made up
of harmony and order.

320
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:43,251
So it's the human heart that's
responsible for the world's corruption?

321
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:49,548
[Shinji] It's hard to imagine the oceans
could have been blue before I was born.

322
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:53,302
[Kaji] What amazes me is
that they could restore the environment,

323
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:55,221
make it liveable again.

324
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,973
But there's something about it...

325
00:25:57,056 --> 00:26:01,102
[sniffing] I think that ocean
smells a little funny, don't you?

326
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,896
It's the smell
of marine creatures rotting.

327
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,607
A testament to their life.

328
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:11,737
It's not like those empty red waters.
That's how a real ocean looks and smells.

329
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:15,283
The world, not just the oceans here,
is huge,

330
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:17,159
and bustling with all sorts of life.

331
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:20,538
I wanted all of you
to know that first-hand.

332
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:24,750
I'm so happy right now! Too bad
Miss Misato didn't come along today.

333
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:28,421
Yeah, I knew she wouldn't come.
Too many memories.

334
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:31,007
Memories of what exactly?

335
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,842
Memories of the Second Impact.

336
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:20,473
[Kaji] Do you know why
Misato decided to join NERV?

337
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:25,561
Her father was a scientist there.
Consumed by his work.

338
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,647
His research was all he thought about.

339
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:30,941
I think Misato resented him for that.

340
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:35,946
- Maybe to the point of hating him.
- So you have issues with your father?

341
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,156
We have that in common.

342
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:40,242
She was right about that.

343
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:44,413
Yet, in the end, it was
her father who saved her life.

344
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:49,418
Survivor's guilt is real.
You carry a lot of baggage.

345
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:52,088
You have to accept the loss
and pick up the torch.

346
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:56,092
And when you're the sole survivor,
I guess it's even worse.

347
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:00,346
So, you see,
you're not the only one hurting.

348
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:08,771
The Mauna Kea Observatory
spotted it three minutes ago.

349
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,856
Analysing and calculating trajectory!

350
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:15,069
Observation Satellite 3 has images
of the object. Maximum magnification.

351
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,239
[everyone gasps]

352
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:20,699
Its AT Field is so powerful
that it can warp light.

353
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:24,578
Absolutely amazing. All right.
Projected point of impact?

354
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,623
Let me guess. Right on us.

355
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:33,212
Magi is still calculating. But probability
of impact on NERV HQ is 99.9999%.

356
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,971
[Hyuga] Orbital N-two mines
have no effect on it.

357
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,390
Can we alter its trajectory?

358
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:47,643
The AT Field energy projection
is focused on a single point.

359
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,229
What's more, the speed of its descent
is helping it.

360
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:53,149
So the Angel itself
is a bomb that's coming right at us.

361
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:57,194
A direct hit would result in an impact
crater 260 miles in diameter,

362
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:00,364
and a geoid deviation of minus 15,000.

363
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:04,243
Tokyo Three would be completely levelled,
the Geofront would be exposed

364
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,287
and Central Dogma
left with no protection.

365
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,164
- What's the commander say?
- It's causing

366
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,249
massive electrostatic disruption.

367
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,835
Comm link with him is not possible.

368
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:15,588
So we're gonna have to take care
of this threat on our own.

369
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,509
Contact the Government.
Make sure all of the agencies are warned.

370
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:24,138
Issue Special Declaration D-17
under NERV authority.

371
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,474
Order immediate evacuation
of all civilians

372
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:29,351
- within a 120-kilometre radius.
- No problem there!

373
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:33,063
An example is being made. Government
officials are rushing to get out!

374
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:50,539
[woman] Evacuation of all
 citizens from Tokyo Three complete.

375
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,250
Non-combatant personnel
 and class-D employees

376
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:56,962
have been directed toward shelters,
 under class-C departmental alert.

377
00:29:57,046 --> 00:30:00,007
I've initiated
a complete Magi backup at Matsushiro.

378
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,592
[Ritsuko] So what do you plan to do?

379
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:05,095
Evas might be powerful,
but unfortunately, they can't fly.

380
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:08,766
And the massive spatial distortions
mean we can't shoot at the target.

381
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:11,977
So how are we going to stop
a gigantic beast like this one?

382
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,070
- [Ritsuko] You can't be serious!
- [Misato] I am dead serious!

383
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,572
Come on,
how can you even call that a plan?

384
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:27,493
MAGI computations
put the odds of failure at over 99%.

385
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,829
And even if it did work,
we would lose all three Evas!

386
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:33,749
As head of tech R&D,
I find the risk unacceptable.

387
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,835
- At least we have a chance of success.
- We need to do our duty

388
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,462
instead of hoping for miracles.

389
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:41,340
Protecting Lilith and Unit One
should be our top priorities.

390
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:42,800
I'm not hoping for a miracle.

391
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:44,760
We'll make one happen through sheer will.

392
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:48,722
- Colonel Katsuragi!
- I am the senior officer in charge.

393
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:50,975
I make the call, here.

394
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:57,565
- Besides, defeating Angels is my job!
- Your job? Or your personal vendetta?

395
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,109
You want revenge against the Angels.

396
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:03,737
- [Asuka] What? Catch it with our hands?
- [Misato] That's right.

397
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:08,033
You will directly catch the Angel
with your Evas' AT Fields at full power.

398
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:09,910
The target is concealing its trajectory,

399
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:14,123
so calculations based on adaptive
optical observation are unreliable.

400
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,792
So, in order to cover all bases,
quite literally,

401
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,503
we will need all three Evas
to take part in this operation.

402
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:22,047
Forget it!
I can defeat the Angel by myself!

403
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:24,800
No, you can't. One Eva, by itself,

404
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:28,429
cannot cover
the entire projected impact perimeter.

405
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,181
- How did you figure our position?
- Woman's intuition.

406
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:35,019
- So you made a wild guess!
- What are our chances of success?

407
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:37,688
- No clue, really. Heaven only knows.
- Ha!

408
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:40,065
All the more reason
to keep those two outta my way!

409
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:43,235
I'm more than capable
of saving humanity all by myself!

410
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:46,905
[Misato] You may be great in one-on-one
combat, but that's not what we need today.

411
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:49,366
So what you're saying
is that I'm not good enough?

412
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:53,912
What I'm saying is that
the three of you need to work together

413
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:55,414
to give us a miracle.

414
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:58,375
[radio traffic] All Eva units
 running on live electrical feed.

415
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:00,210
Physiological power supplies are green.

416
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:03,422
[man] Shin-Gotenba relay station online.
 Commencing charging.

417
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:06,634
[man 2] Auxiliary power cables
 have arrived on site.

418
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:10,012
[woman] All pilots are standing by.
 Vitals are nominal.

419
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,014
Final medical check complete.
 We are go.

420
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,767
Currently testing
 Number Seven transformer group.

421
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:18,479
Work crew should vacate areas
 once power linkup is verified.

422
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:23,484
Power linkup check of Number Six
 Emergency Power System is complete.

423
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:24,818
Status nominal.

424
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:31,200
[Shinji] I don't know why, but sitting
 in here feels strangely calm

425
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,494
at a time like this.

426
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:36,372
Maybe I'm just getting used to it?

427
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,123
That's strange.

428
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:40,959
It feels almost familiar.

429
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:44,380
This smell, it reminds me of my mother.

430
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:47,549
Or Ayanami?

431
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:50,344
[operator woman]
 Calculating target trajectory.

432
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,971
OK, everyone, here it comes.

433
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:55,557
All Eva units, get ready to start!

434
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,650
[Misato]
 Secondary data from HQ won't be reliable,

435
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:07,277
so each of you
 needs to use their best judgment.

436
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:10,197
Everything is riding on you and your Evas.

437
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,700
[Aoba] Target approaching.
Distance about 12 miles!

438
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:14,493
All right. Commence operation!

439
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:17,663
And launch!

440
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,988
[Aoba] Target's AT Field has morphed!

441
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:54,408
New trajectory!
Adjusting estimated impact location!

442
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:58,162
- [Hyuga] Target speed increasing!
- It's faster than what their models said!

443
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:01,331
- I won't get there in time, damn it!
- I'll take care of it somehow!

444
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:03,292
- Miss Misato!
- Layout emergency course!

445
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,210
- 6-0-5 to 6-7-5.
- Roger!

446
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,764
Next! 1-0-7 to 2-0-7-8! Stand by!

447
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:30,527
Yah!

448
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:59,848
[Aoba] Target transforming!
Approaching the ground!

449
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,771
AT Field, full power!

450
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,453
Aaah!

451
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:42,724
Hang on, Coattails!

452
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:45,060
- Unit Two, target core.
- I know what to do!

453
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:50,357
I don't take orders from you! Yah!

454
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,612
Take that! Oh no, I missed!

455
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,491
This bastard should just give up!
30 seconds left!

456
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:13,714
- Asuka! Hurry!
- I know. I'm trying to!

457
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:18,719
Commander's pet?

458
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:24,266
- Please hurry!
- Asuka!

459
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,394
I told you that I know what to do!

460
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:28,854
Argh!

461
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,693
You haven't had enough?

462
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:16,068
[laboured breathing]

463
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:36,338
[Misato] Well done, guys, and thank you.

464
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:40,092
Radio is back online. Incoming
transmission from Commander Ikari.

465
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:42,135
Patch him through.

466
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:47,099
My apologies, Commander. My decisions
resulted in damage to all three Evas,

467
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:49,434
as well as injuries
to all three of the pilots.

468
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:51,937
I take full responsibility
for this operation.

469
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:54,898
[Fuyutsuki] No matter.
 That was a small price to pay.

470
00:37:54,982 --> 00:37:57,526
The important thing
 is that you defeated the target.

471
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:01,697
[Gendoh] Agreed.
 You performed well, Colonel Katsuragi.

472
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,156
Thank you, Commander.

473
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,909
[Gendoh] Patch me through
 to the pilot of Unit One.

474
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,455
[Gendoh] I've heard the news.
 Good work, Shinji.

475
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:13,000
Um... uh, thank you.

476
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,961
[Gendoh] Colonel Katsuragi,
 I'll leave you to handle the rest.

477
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:19,131
[Misato] Yes, sir.
 Initiate recovery of the three Evas!

478
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:23,427
[Ibuki] Priority to Unit One.
 Transport Unit One to Cage 99.

479
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:33,812
I couldn't do it by myself.
I just couldn't.

480
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,577
[sighs]

481
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,679
I've only ever been by myself.

482
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:13,268
Being alone, it never bothered me before.

483
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:27,616
Huh? What?

484
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,284
Don't turn around.

485
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,746
[sounds of disquiet]

486
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,375
Hey, Coattails.

487
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:40,212
Let me stay here for a while.

488
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:48,011
OK, Miss Shikinami. Of course.

489
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:53,975
Today, you yelled out my name
during the battle, remember?

490
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:58,897
So I'll give you permission to
call me Asuka. And I'll call you...

491
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,607
Idiot Shinji.

492
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:06,113
So... uh, Asuka, tell me,
why do you pilot an Eva?

493
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:10,117
Dumb question. Just keep
your mouth shut, Idiot Shinji.

494
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:17,958
I pilot my Eva for my own sake.

495
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:20,502
What about you?

496
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:22,712
I'm not really sure.

497
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,133
You're such an idiot.

498
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:28,802
You're just saying that
to avoid giving a real answer.

499
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:33,515
I guess I want my father to praise me.

500
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:37,978
He did it today,
for the first time in my life.

501
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:42,774
I've never felt so happy and proud
of anything before.

502
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:44,651
I wonder...

503
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:47,404
I wonder if my father
is proud of me now.

504
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:51,324
Maybe it's just like Miss Misato said.

505
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:58,665
I can't believe it.
You really are an idiot.

506
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:08,383
Chow time! Chow time! Come on,
this is the best part of the school day!

507
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:11,303
What?
You didn't bring a lunchbox for me?

508
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:14,431
Sorry, I was busy with homework.
I didn't have time to do it.

509
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:18,059
That's no excuse! How dare you
deprive me of my lunch, you idiot!

510
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:21,271
- Do you want me to starve?
- I'll bring you one tomorrow, OK?

511
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:24,316
Oh, man!
The class lovebirds are fighting!

512
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:25,525
[laughter]

513
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:26,651
[both] Don't say that!

514
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:32,240
[Misato] Asuka, can you bring me
your facial cleanser?

515
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:35,619
[Asuka] Cut it out, Misato!
Buy your own, for a change!

516
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,579
[Misato] You're such a cheapskate!

517
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:42,834
[Tohji] Chow time!
Best part of the school day!

518
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:44,502
This looks great!

519
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:48,173
That's pretty good.

520
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,550
But it could be better.
He's slacking off.

521
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,303
[Hikari] Hello! How are you Asuka?

522
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,014
I'd like to have lunch with you.
Is that OK?

523
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,769
Yeah, OK.
But I'm not sharing my food with you.

524
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:02,103
[chuckles]

525
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,524
[Shinji] This is for you.

526
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,571
This is for you.
I noticed you never bring lunch.

527
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,242
[gasps] Thank you very much.

528
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:18,411
I'm so glad I got up the courage to
ask you. I'm a little intimidat --

529
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:22,791
- Here. You can have the rest.
- Huh?

530
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:27,504
Oh! I'm stuffed!
Thank you for the delicious meal!

531
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:31,299
- Having a late lunch, I see.
- Oh. Yeah. Thank you.

532
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,636
I hear Shinji
is making those lunches for you.

533
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:38,348
I'm not surprised. You were never
much of a wizard in the kitchen.

534
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:44,354
Guess that's true. But that's because,
unlike your lazy butt,

535
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:46,731
I'm always busy with work!

536
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:49,067
[Kaji] You are as dedicated as ever.

537
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:52,112
That's your strength,
but it could also be a weakness.

538
00:42:52,988 --> 00:42:56,074
From what I heard, you fought
with Ritsuko during the last attack.

539
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,828
- You need to chill a little.
- Well, I'm sorry.

540
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,955
It happens
when you have responsibilities.

541
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:04,916
- Not that you'd understand.
- Still, you should be careful.

542
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,295
- You're less sexy when you're stressed.
- I didn't ask for your opinion!

543
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:35,989
"Thank you". Words of gratitude.
 The very first words.

544
00:43:37,741 --> 00:43:40,577
Words I've never said to him.

545
00:43:42,162 --> 00:43:43,705
[Hikari] All rise!

546
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:45,957
Bow!

547
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:48,001
Be seated!

548
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:53,423
Uh... Apparently miss Ayanami
is absent again. Well, never mind.

549
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,800
She seemed to be OK yesterday.

550
00:43:57,427 --> 00:43:59,804
- I wonder what happened.
- They're like me, that way.

551
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:02,891
"They can only survive in there."

552
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:05,268
I wonder what she meant.

553
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,775
[Gendoh] Rei.

554
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,156
Let's have dinner together.

555
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:20,909
[Rei] Yes.

556
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:30,251
- Commander Ikari.
- What is it?

557
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,421
Do you enjoy having meals, like this?

558
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:34,589
I do.

559
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:39,594
Do you enjoy having meals
with other people?

560
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:41,388
I do.

561
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:46,893
And do you like it
when people cook for you?

562
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,020
I do.

563
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:56,528
Commander Ikari,
would you like to share a meal

564
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:59,739
with Shinji and others?

565
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:03,493
Well, I have very little time.

566
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:10,250
My dear, take care of Shinji.

567
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:18,633
All right, then. I'll come.

568
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:23,680
[operator woman] Simulated
 synchronization tests results are normal.

569
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:26,641
No psychological contamination detected.

570
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,185
[operator man] Plug depth, 0.1, 0.3...

571
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:33,064
Oh, man! I'm so bored!

572
00:45:33,148 --> 00:45:35,692
No Angels around, all we do is run tests!

573
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:38,987
- Nothing is happening!
- Well, "nothing happening" is good news.

574
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,865
We do our best and work really hard
in the hope that someday,

575
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:45,410
we're finally rid of Angels
and the world is at peace. Whoo!

576
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:48,746
A today like yesterday
and a tomorrow like today.

577
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:51,666
Celebrating the repetition
of uneventful days. You're right.

578
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,460
Let's be happy nothing's happening.

579
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:57,755
Diagnostics complete.
Readings are nominal.

580
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:01,676
[Ritsuko] Enough for today.
 You did well. Thank you.

581
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:06,139
[operator voices in the background]

582
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:14,814
[Hyuga] Sorry to say this, but if
the Evas keep getting so heavily damaged,

583
00:46:14,898 --> 00:46:17,484
we won't be able
to repair them fast enough.

584
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:20,069
So maybe we should do away
with the Vatican Treaty.

585
00:46:20,153 --> 00:46:23,364
[Misato] I wish! With only three
Evas allowed per country,

586
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:26,701
we're chronically short
on operational units.

587
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:30,163
[Ibuki] Even now, we're forced to give
priority to the repairs on Unit One.

588
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:32,874
We're using all the spare parts
we have to keep it operational.

589
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:36,544
We have no idea when we can finish
repairing Unit Zero.

590
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:39,506
[Ritsuko] All the nations
negotiated fiercely for that treaty.

591
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:43,551
A revision is unrealistic.
And with their precious Unit Five lost,

592
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:47,555
Europe and Russia are trying to get other
Asian countries to go along with them.

593
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:50,517
Politics. Complicates everything!

594
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:54,312
[Ibuki] We're here to save humanity,
but there's so much to do before that.

595
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:05,073
- Huh?
- Watch out! Coming through!

596
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:13,081
[groans]

597
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,426
Sheesh, where are my glasses?

598
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:31,891
- I'm so sorry. I hope you're all right.
- [phone rings]

599
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:35,228
Hello, Mari here.

600
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:38,982
Yes. But I think I glided off target.

601
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:42,485
It looks like I'm on the roof
of a school or something.

602
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:47,198
What? You're the one who told me
to enter into Japan covertly!

603
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:51,077
Why don't you have the Euro branch
work this out?

604
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:55,582
Just be there for my extraction later,
OK? Thanks!

605
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:03,047
- Huh?
- [sniffing]

606
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:08,052
Well, well, well. You smell pretty nice.
Actually, you smell like LCL.

607
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:12,640
- Huh?
- Makes you... pretty interesting.

608
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:16,811
Right, well, let's keep all this
between us. OK with you, NERV doggy?

609
00:48:28,448 --> 00:48:30,491
Huh? What's wrong?

610
00:48:31,868 --> 00:48:34,412
[operator] Third regional
 coastguard military unit.

611
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:36,039
[gasps]

612
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:39,334
Hey. How are you?
Would you like to go on a date?

613
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:42,128
Huh? But... I'm a guy.

614
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:43,838
I have no problem with that.

615
00:48:45,465 --> 00:48:47,675
Don't you know
that love is gender-blind?

616
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:51,220
[Shinji screams]

617
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:53,723
Just kidding!

618
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,768
- Here.
- Huh?

619
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:11,407
That's the smell... of earth.

620
00:49:11,908 --> 00:49:13,451
[Kaji] Are you tired already?

621
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:17,038
I paid in advance, so you gotta work!

622
00:49:17,372 --> 00:49:21,042
What do you mean, "paid"?
You're talking about that can of coffee?

623
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:24,587
I thought you said this was a date.

624
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:28,216
You're not the nice man
I thought you were, Mr Kaji.

625
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:29,842
You live and you learn!

626
00:49:29,926 --> 00:49:31,969
Gotta be a bit sneaky
when you're a grown-up.

627
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:33,680
Hmm.

628
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:37,392
So, these plants...

629
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:42,271
- they're watermelon, right?
- Yep! Cute, huh? It's my hobby.

630
00:49:42,814 --> 00:49:46,067
Making and growing things...
These are wonderful hobbies.

631
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,362
You see and understand new things.

632
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:51,155
Fun things, sometimes.

633
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:54,659
[Shinji] And sometimes painful too?

634
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:56,619
You're afraid of pain?

635
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,831
I'd rather avoid it, if I can.

636
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:02,500
Have you found anything you really enjoy?

637
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:05,753
That's all right.

638
00:50:05,837 --> 00:50:10,258
Listen, being a little familiar
with pain makes a person more caring.

639
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:13,469
So never mistake that for weakness.

640
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:17,473
Tell me something. Do you like Misato?

641
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:24,981
Miss Misato? Um, well, I mean,
I... uh, I don't dislike her.

642
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:28,192
Please protect her. Do it for me.

643
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:32,155
It's just that... that I can't.

644
00:50:32,822 --> 00:50:34,449
You're the only person who can.

645
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:37,410
So, please.

646
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:08,858
Good morning.

647
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:12,528
- Ayanami!
- Did I imagine that?

648
00:51:12,612 --> 00:51:16,115
- No, she said, "Good morning".
- [students] Oh!

649
00:51:16,449 --> 00:51:19,035
Ayanami, are you OK?

650
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:21,162
Yes. I'm fine today.

651
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:24,332
What happened to your hand?

652
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,877
It's OK. Dr Akagi took care of it.

653
00:51:28,795 --> 00:51:32,006
- How did you injure it?
- It's a secret.

654
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:35,384
I'll tell you,
once I get better at it.

655
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,731
- [Misato] Rei has changed.
- [Ritsuko] Yes. That's true.

656
00:51:48,815 --> 00:51:51,359
It's hard to imagine
her doing anything for someone else.

657
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:54,529
It seems out of character.
I wonder what brought this on.

658
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:59,075
- Well, do you think it could be love?
- Please, Misato! That's impossible.

659
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:01,077
[slurps]

660
00:52:01,536 --> 00:52:03,246
Hmm.

661
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:07,416
I'm sure idiot Shinji would probably
like a more subtle flavour.

662
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,545
- [Misato] I'm home!
- Misato? Is that you?

663
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:14,048
- You're home early.
- But I have to rush right back to HQ.

664
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,676
I just came for a quick bath
and a change of clothes.

665
00:52:17,385 --> 00:52:20,596
[sniffs] Ooh! Wow!

666
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,932
Wow! What do we have here?

667
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:25,768
Are you cooking
a nice little meal for Shinji as well?

668
00:52:25,852 --> 00:52:30,189
Uh! Not a all! This is for a friend!
Her name is Hikari.

669
00:52:30,273 --> 00:52:34,026
[chuckles] First Rei gets all
lovey-dovey, now you get romantic too!

670
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:36,696
What?
I'm nothing like the commander's pet!

671
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:40,992
Uh, no, you're right! It looks like Rei
is planning something more than a dinner.

672
00:52:41,409 --> 00:52:44,579
- What does that mean?
- She'd like to be the peacemaker

673
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:47,623
who will bridge the gap
between the commander and Shinji.

674
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:52,044
So she's inviting everyone to a dinner
party and plans to do all the cooking.

675
00:52:52,128 --> 00:52:54,589
It's so simple
that it might actually work!

676
00:52:55,298 --> 00:52:59,886
I gotta say, getting the father and son
to get along is not gonna be easy!

677
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:02,346
And she's doing that
just for idiot Shinji?

678
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:05,433
It's supposed to be a special surprise,
so please don't let Shinji know.

679
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:09,687
Just who do you think I am?
Of course I won't!

680
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:31,459
[cacophony of operators talking at once]

681
00:53:32,752 --> 00:53:37,715
Vaporised? Eva Unit Four and
the Second Branch just went up in smoke?

682
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:41,093
[Aoba] This is data
from ground zero at T plus ten.

683
00:53:41,928 --> 00:53:43,220
[Misato] That's horrible.

684
00:53:43,304 --> 00:53:46,849
Satellite intel shows there must
have been a huge AT Field collapse.

685
00:53:46,933 --> 00:53:50,853
- But that's about all we know.
- Unit 4 must have been at the epicentre.

686
00:53:50,937 --> 00:53:54,565
- How about our Evas? Are they safe here?
- Well, Unit 4...

687
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:58,945
It was a test-bed Eva with a new kind
of internal power source,

688
00:53:59,028 --> 00:54:03,783
designed to be more self-sufficient
during combat. Supposedly.

689
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:06,077
It was developed
at the North American Branch.

690
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,121
Most of their research was
kept secret, even from doctor Akagi.

691
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:11,123
Yeah, but not from everyone.

692
00:54:11,207 --> 00:54:12,667
Eva Unit Four.

693
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:17,129
It was an experimental unit designed
to test the new generation of Evas.

694
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:21,092
Anything can happen with a prototype.
But...

695
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:26,347
An accident, really?

696
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:59,463
[Tohji] Three of those. Thanks, ma'am.

697
00:55:01,841 --> 00:55:04,802
Thanks a lot, Tohji.
You never buy us anything.

698
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:06,971
That's on you!
I never thought a square like you

699
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:09,849
would hang with us
after school for snacks!

700
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:11,392
You should tell him the good news.

701
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:14,020
Your sister is getting better
and you want to celebrate.

702
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:18,441
That's my good news! I'm the one
who should tell him, bigmouth! Argh!

703
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:26,782
So tell me, Ikari. Is it true
that Unit Three is coming to Japan?

704
00:55:26,866 --> 00:55:29,160
Unit Three? I didn't know that.

705
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:34,373
I heard the US want the Eva's activation
tests to be done in our facilities.

706
00:55:34,457 --> 00:55:37,460
Well, I guess the pilots
don't need to know that kind of stuff.

707
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:39,545
By the way,
do you know who will pilot it?

708
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:42,131
How would I know?
You just told me about it!

709
00:55:43,174 --> 00:55:47,053
Oh, man, Eva pilots are so cool!
I wish I could become a pilot too!

710
00:55:47,303 --> 00:55:49,930
I can't do anything about it.
I have no say in that stuff.

711
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:51,974
Man! No luck this time!

712
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:07,198
[Keel] Evangelion Unit Five
 was recently destroyed.

713
00:56:07,907 --> 00:56:10,951
And now Unit Four has been lost as well.

714
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:12,620
[Gendoh] The loss of both units

715
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:15,539
will seriously hinder
the execution of our plans.

716
00:56:15,623 --> 00:56:19,335
[Keel] It should not.
 These setbacks are correctable.

717
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:23,631
[Gendoh] The US government has begged
you to accept Eva Unit Three.

718
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:26,342
Your government seems ready to cooperate.

719
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:29,887
[Keel] It is a brand-new Eva.
 Perfect to be your main weapon.

720
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:33,182
[Gendoh] Angel elimination operations
are still ongoing.

721
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:36,310
We cannot put our faith
in an untested unit.

722
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:40,231
If you would only approve the extra
funding for the repairs on Unit Zero...

723
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:43,567
[Keel] What for?
 It was only supposed to be a prototype.

724
00:56:43,651 --> 00:56:46,278
- We don't need it any more.
- That's true.

725
00:56:46,362 --> 00:56:48,614
There are more pressing issues at hand.

726
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:52,660
[Keel] The true Evangelion.
 The one we all dream of.

727
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:56,664
Its birth and the resurrection
 of Lilith will seal the Covenant.

728
00:56:56,747 --> 00:57:00,543
The required rites
 must be carried out ahead of that.

729
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:04,213
All we do, we do for
 the Human Instrumentality Project.

730
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:09,176
[Gendoh] I am well aware. Everything
shall proceed according to SEELE's plans.

731
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:13,430
The true Evangelion...

732
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:18,352
All currently active units,
including Unit One,

733
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,105
only exist to clear the path for it.

734
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:23,149
[Fuyutsuki] And that is the Mark Six?

735
00:57:23,983 --> 00:57:26,110
Their false gods don't satisfy them?

736
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:29,488
They want to build themselves a real one,
this time?

737
00:57:29,572 --> 00:57:33,826
[Gendoh] Right. We must expedite
the awakening of Unit One.

738
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:40,332
[operator woman] Eva Unit Two.
 Core separation complete.

739
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:43,294
[Asuka] Why does my Unit Two
have to be placed in storage?

740
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:45,337
[Ritsuko]
You know about the Vatican Treaty.

741
00:57:46,172 --> 00:57:48,174
These are the terms
for accepting Unit Three.

742
00:57:48,257 --> 00:57:51,218
Why don't you store Unit Zero?
It's not even fully repaired!

743
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:54,889
[Ibuki] The Euro Branch is in charge.
They retain Unit Two's command codes.

744
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:56,974
There's nothing we can do about it.

745
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:59,685
[Ritsuko] For now, Unit Two has no pilot.

746
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:02,771
You'll have to await further orders
from the Euro branch.

747
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:05,858
Unit Two is mine.
No one else can pilot it.

748
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:10,154
The Evas are combat weapons.
There's a backup for everything.

749
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:11,906
Including the pilots.

750
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,241
No way!

751
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:18,871
This Eva is the only place
where I really belong.

752
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:40,893
[sniffs]

753
00:58:42,811 --> 00:58:45,231
Evas are reflections
of their pilots' hearts.

754
00:58:45,314 --> 00:58:49,068
- What did you say?
- You don't need to be dependent on them.

755
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:51,487
You can be happy without an Eva. .

756
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:53,113
I don't need you lecturing me right now!

757
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:54,865
You're just the commander's pet!

758
00:58:56,951 --> 00:59:01,288
I was chosen to be a pilot on merit!
I'm a prodigy and I worked my way here!

759
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:03,791
Unlike you two,
no one played favourites with me!

760
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:06,794
I'm a pilot because I'm bound to it.

761
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:09,755
The Eva
is my only link to other people.

762
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:13,133
Shut up! You're here today
because you're just a baby-faced doll

763
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:15,678
who does everything
commander Ikari tells you to!

764
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:19,056
- I am not a doll.
- Yes, you are!

765
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:21,016
Be honest with yourself, for once!

766
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:34,905
You're pretty cocky, aren't you?
For a doll.

767
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,874
I just have one question.
What do you think of the other idiot?

768
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:47,710
- Idiot?
- Idiot Shinji.

769
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:50,254
- Who else would I be talking about?
- What about him?

770
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:52,256
Answer my question.

771
00:59:52,965 --> 00:59:56,635
- I don't know what to tell you.
- You Japanese, always so evasive!

772
00:59:56,719 --> 00:59:59,930
- Just tell me what you think of him!
- It's hard to say.

773
01:00:00,014 --> 01:00:04,351
But I feel all warm and fuzzy inside
when I'm with him.

774
01:00:04,435 --> 01:00:08,188
So that's why I want Shinji
to feel warm and fuzzy too.

775
01:00:08,731 --> 01:00:13,819
I wish he'd feel better about himself
by being closer to commander Ikari.

776
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:17,156
Now it makes sense. Ugh!

777
01:00:21,035 --> 01:00:26,790
Talk about stupidity of epic proportions!
Only one explanation. You're in love!

778
01:00:26,874 --> 01:00:29,752
[Japanese music]

779
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:34,506
This dinner party should be fun.

780
01:00:35,424 --> 01:00:37,926
I wonder if Ayanami's cooking
will be any good.

781
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,600
I only wish Father could come too.

782
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:48,187
[operator speaking in background]

783
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:52,524
[Misato] So, that's the new Dummy System?

784
01:00:52,608 --> 01:00:55,361
It's only supposed to provide
supplemental pilot assistance,

785
01:00:55,444 --> 01:00:57,321
but it can run the Eva by itself

786
01:00:57,404 --> 01:01:00,824
and even project an AT Field
without a human pilot.

787
01:01:00,908 --> 01:01:03,577
They say it solves
the ethical dilemma of using children.

788
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,540
- [Japanese music]
- [thud]

789
01:01:08,624 --> 01:01:10,626
They just put in that new Dummy System.

790
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:13,754
Well, I don't trust it at all,
let me tell you that!

791
01:01:14,505 --> 01:01:17,883
Right, that new super-secret black box
that Golgotha Base sent here.

792
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:21,011
- It's an enigma, that's for sure.
- Humph!

793
01:01:21,095 --> 01:01:23,097
How can they trust that thing
to pilot an Eva?

794
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:26,183
- Are they completely crazy or what?
- Because the Evas

795
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:28,894
should only be entrusted to kids?
Is that it?

796
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:32,314
Shinji's being entrusted with a lot.

797
01:01:32,398 --> 01:01:35,442
Ah! I suppose you feel
he is worthy of your trust.

798
01:01:35,526 --> 01:01:40,114
Hey, listen, can you give me
any intel on this SEELE group?

799
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:42,408
Our supervisors.

800
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:45,953
I'm warning you,
that's dangerous territory.

801
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:49,706
I have to know.
Human Instrumentality Project.

802
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:52,000
What is NERV really doing
behind our backs?

803
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:54,128
Good question.

804
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:55,337
Hmm.

805
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,549
I wish I knew.

806
01:01:58,632 --> 01:01:59,967
Ugh.

807
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:03,637
We haven't had dinner together
in forever.

808
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,014
And all you do
is talk about work.

809
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:08,600
We're not college kids any more.

810
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:12,688
We've learned tough life lessons.
We carry much more baggage.

811
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:16,233
We have big responsibilities.
There's no room for us to be selfish.

812
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:20,904
Shinji and the others, they carry
an even bigger set of responsibilities.

813
01:02:20,988 --> 01:02:24,241
Yeah. The burden is too heavy for kids.

814
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:27,327
But we have no one else to turn to.

815
01:02:28,036 --> 01:02:29,746
[phone rings]

816
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:34,918
Hello?

817
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:40,007
Yes. I know, I know.
I'll make a decision before midnight, OK?

818
01:02:41,383 --> 01:02:42,926
- Was that Ritsuko?
- Yes.

819
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:45,929
She's pressuring me to decide
who will pilot Unit Three.

820
01:02:46,013 --> 01:02:48,140
Well, that is your responsibility.

821
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:50,684
I know, but its arrival has been delayed.

822
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:53,604
Because of that,
its first tests have been pushed back...

823
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,690
to the worst day possible.

824
01:02:57,149 --> 01:03:00,569
Activation and testing
of Unit Three scheduled for...

825
01:03:01,195 --> 01:03:03,572
the day of the commander's pet's
dinner party.

826
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:33,268
[Ritsuko] I see. So it's gonna be Asuka?

827
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:37,481
OK. Yes, I'll take the redeye
to Matsushiro.

828
01:03:38,065 --> 01:03:39,983
I'll leave you in charge, Maya.

829
01:03:40,067 --> 01:03:41,360
[Ibuki] Yes, Doctor.

830
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:45,364
- Um... Dr Akagi?
- Yes?

831
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:51,036
Can I leave a message
for the second girl, if you don't mind?

832
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:05,467
Welcome to your voicemail.
 You have two new messages.

833
01:04:05,551 --> 01:04:07,177
Now playing message number one.

834
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:08,637
[beep]

835
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,348
[Ritsuko]
 Here you go, Rei. Leave your message.

836
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:15,644
[sighs]

837
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:24,319
[groans and scoffs]

838
01:04:24,403 --> 01:04:26,280
- [Rei] Thank you.
- Huh?

839
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:32,494
Humph! What an idiot!
I just want to pilot an Eva!

840
01:04:37,249 --> 01:04:41,670
Just one thing. If I like
Unit Three, can you paint it red?

841
01:04:45,132 --> 01:04:47,926
- [Hikari] Good morning, class.
- Good morning.

842
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:51,638
- You're alone? Where's Tohji?
- He went to the hospital in Odawara.

843
01:04:51,722 --> 01:04:54,433
To see his sister.
She's getting discharged today.

844
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:56,643
Oh, right. I see.

845
01:04:57,352 --> 01:05:00,230
[Kensuke] Message from Tohji.
"No need to worry any more.

846
01:05:00,314 --> 01:05:03,525
My sister thanks you too."
End of message.

847
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:06,862
There you go.
That's wonderful news, isn't it?

848
01:05:09,156 --> 01:05:12,784
So, Rei has planned a dinner party
especially for you, tonight, huh?

849
01:05:12,868 --> 01:05:15,245
Hmm. Oh, I'm so jealous, you lucky dog!

850
01:05:15,329 --> 01:05:16,663
Hey, cut it out!

 Standing by in mobile quarantine chamber.

858
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:02,167
It looks like
I can hand off the rest to Ritsuko.

859
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:05,545
[man] Maintenance Group Six
 has completed evacuation.

860
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:08,882
- All systems go.
- Secure transmission. From Asuka?

861
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:14,137
What's up, Asuka? You're almost on.

862
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:17,808
I just wanted to talk to you, Misato.
Girl to girl.

863
01:06:18,684 --> 01:06:21,144
I see. I'm glad you called.

864
01:06:21,228 --> 01:06:24,064
I wanted to thank you again.
For doing this.

865
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:28,652
No need to thank me.

866
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:33,198
Helping the idiotic masses
is the duty of the elite.

867
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:37,119
Besides, spending time with others
has never been my thing.

868
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:40,455
Most of all,
I hate pretending to be happy to fit in.

869
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,667
I can't stand
to watch others be happy, either.

870
01:06:44,126 --> 01:06:46,461
I just wanted to pilot an Eva,
that's it.

871
01:06:47,087 --> 01:06:49,089
I like being alone, anyway.

872
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:51,591
I don't want to team up with "friends."

873
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:54,970
Nobody ever sees me
for who I really am, anyway.

874
01:06:55,053 --> 01:06:56,930
I never cared if I'm all alone.

875
01:06:57,013 --> 01:07:00,308
As long as I get top marks,
I'll be fine at NERV.

876
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:04,813
But recently, there were times when
 being around others didn't bother me.

877
01:07:05,564 --> 01:07:07,774
I know it sounds strange, coming from me.

878
01:07:07,858 --> 01:07:09,109
No, it doesn't.

879
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:11,361
You're kind and caring, Asuka.

880
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:15,657
You're the first person
I ever told that kind of thing.

881
01:07:15,741 --> 01:07:17,659
Now, I feel better somehow.

882
01:07:17,743 --> 01:07:21,538
Talking to other people feels good,
doesn't it? I never knew that.

883
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:25,333
This world is vast
and bustling with all sorts of fun things

884
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:26,835
that you don't know about.

885
01:07:26,918 --> 01:07:28,378
Enjoy it all you can.

886
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:32,132
OK. I will.

887
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:33,884
Thank you, Misato.

888
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:39,055
Oh, one last thing. About this test plug
suit, I really like its colour,

889
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:42,267

it's a bit too revealing, isn't it?

01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:11,815
I want this taken care of
 before the SSDF shows up.

909
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:13,859
- Roger.
- Unknown object detected

910
01:09:13,942 --> 01:09:15,569
moving southwest from blast site.

911
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:16,862
We have a pattern orange.

912
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:18,822
Can't determine if it's an Angel.

913
01:09:19,406 --> 01:09:22,242
- Battle Stations, condition one.
- Ikari...

914
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:24,911
I said,
"Battle Stations, condition one."

915
01:09:24,995 --> 01:09:27,080
I want Unit Zero on standby.

916
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:30,917
Finish installing the Dummy System
on Unit One and then get it deployed.

917
01:09:34,546 --> 01:09:37,799
[man on radio] Fifth armoured company
 in position along defence perimeter 18.

918
01:09:37,883 --> 01:09:41,136
[woman] Two minutes until power cable
 extension is connected and ready.

919
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:43,388
Mobile fire-support strike force
 in position.

920
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:47,183
[Shinji] So, how are Miss Misato,
 Asuka and the others?

921
01:09:47,267 --> 01:09:51,062
- [Aoba] Don't worry.
- [operator voices in the background]

922
01:09:51,146 --> 01:09:54,608
But without other Evas
or Miss Misato around,

923
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:56,943
I don't know
what I'm supposed to be doing.

924
01:09:57,652 --> 01:09:59,487
Command and control will be fine.

925
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:02,198
Commander Ikari
 is personally taking charge now.

926
01:10:02,282 --> 01:10:03,491
Really? Father?

927
01:10:03,575 --> 01:10:07,078
We have a visual on the target.
Onscreen now.

928
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:14,336
We should have been more careful.

929
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:18,298
Send Unit Shutdown signal.
Emergency ejection of Entry Plug.

930
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:24,888
[Ibuki] Negative! Unit not responding to
either shutdown or ejection code signals.

931
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:28,475
[Aoba] Entry plug compromised.
Angel-core contamination.

932
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:31,186
[Hyuga] Pattern analysis complete.
It's blue.

933
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:35,315
Evangelion Unit Three
is hereby declared a total loss.

934
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:38,526
Target will now be designated
as the Ninth Angel.

935
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:40,862
[operator] Target approaching!

936
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:45,367
- Prep ground to ground intercept.
 - Interception forces, open fire.

937
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:50,163
What? It can't be!
An Angel? That's an Angel?

938
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:55,293
- Yes. And it's your target.
- That's my target? How can it be?

939
01:10:56,294 --> 01:10:57,921
[Shinji] That's an Eva!

940
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:03,218
- Wait a minute.
- [Gendoh] The target is closing in.

941
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:07,597
- You will defeat it.
- Defeat it? What am I supposed to do?

942
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:14,562
Wasn't Asuka piloting that Eva?

943
01:11:18,358 --> 01:11:19,693
Where is Asuka?

944
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:32,163
[roars]

945
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:45,010
Damn it! Oh, no!

946
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:49,389
The entry plug!
Asuka is still in there!

947
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:01,109
[groans]

948
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,954
[growls]

949
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:26,801
[woman] Armouring
 on cervical vertebrae corrupted.

950
01:12:26,885 --> 01:12:29,512
Contamination has progressed
to layer 6-200.

951
01:12:29,596 --> 01:12:32,682
I see. A corruption type.
This will be troublesome.

952
01:12:33,058 --> 01:12:35,018
[woman] Unit One's AT Field is unstable.

953
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:39,105
Warning. life support failing!
The pilot's life will be in danger soon.

954
01:12:39,189 --> 01:12:42,358
Block it! Quick.
Lower the nerve connection to 28%!

955
01:12:42,442 --> 01:12:44,819
- Delay that.
- But, Ikari, if we don't act,

956
01:12:44,903 --> 01:12:48,740
- the pilot will die!
- Shinji! Why aren't you fighting?

957
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:52,577
Father, I can't fight.
Asuka is still in that Eva.

958
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:56,372
It doesn't matter!
That is an Angel. That is our enemy.

959
01:12:56,456 --> 01:12:58,416
But I can't do it!

960
01:12:58,917 --> 01:13:02,378
- You're asking me to murder someone!
- You'll die if you don't fight!

961
01:13:02,462 --> 01:13:06,007
I don't care!
I'd rather die than kill Asuka!

962
01:13:06,091 --> 01:13:07,217
That's enough.

963
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,053
Shut down the sync
between Unit One and the pilot.

964
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:12,013
- Ikari?
- Complete sync shut down?

965
01:13:12,097 --> 01:13:14,891
That's right! Switch control
over to the Dummy System.

966
01:13:15,225 --> 01:13:18,269
But, sir, we're not sure
how the Dummy System will react.

967
01:13:18,353 --> 01:13:20,563
Without Dr Akagi, it's too dangerous.

968
01:13:20,647 --> 01:13:22,982
Perhaps, but it's still better
than our current pilot.

969
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:25,068
- Do it.
- Yes, sir.

970
01:13:48,383 --> 01:13:49,843
What's happening?

971
01:13:58,059 --> 01:13:59,769
Father, what are you doing?

972
01:13:59,853 --> 01:14:02,689
[Ibuki] Dummy System activated.
Switchover complete.

973
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:07,861
[operators speak over each other]

974
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:09,988
[woman] AT Field is stable.
 Has recovered --

975
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:13,491
No matter.
Unplug all safeties. Initiate attack.

976
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:47,734
This is what the Dummy System can do?

977
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:51,321
- Dummy System operating normally.
 - Damaged areas are self-repairing.

978
01:15:30,151 --> 01:15:31,819
[sobs]

979
01:15:58,763 --> 01:16:02,684
[SHINJI] What is this, Father?
 What are you doing?

980
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:06,229
What the hell are you doing? [cries]

981
01:16:06,312 --> 01:16:11,109
Stop it! Stop, dammit!
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

982
01:16:11,192 --> 01:16:14,279
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

983
01:16:14,362 --> 01:16:16,948
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

984
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:19,158
Stop, stop, stop!

985
01:16:20,827 --> 01:16:22,537
What's that sound?

986
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:25,915
Don't do this!

987
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:33,798
Aaah!

988
01:16:54,694 --> 01:16:58,823
[RADIO] Team Three, expedite data deletion
 of Eight Zero Seven as soon as possible.

989
01:16:58,906 --> 01:17:01,784
[man] We're investigating
 the situation at ground zero right now.

990
01:17:01,868 --> 01:17:03,328
The inspection will be difficult.

991
01:17:03,411 --> 01:17:06,331
But I'll make sure
 an intermediate report will be...

992
01:17:06,414 --> 01:17:07,707
I'm alive?

993
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,172
- Kaji?
- You were lucky, Katsuragi.

994
01:17:14,881 --> 01:17:16,215
What about Ritsuko?

995
01:17:16,883 --> 01:17:19,677
[Kaji] Don't worry.
She had it easier than you.

996
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:22,555
I see.

997
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:26,309
Asuka? What about Unit Three?

998
01:17:26,601 --> 01:17:30,355
It was designated an Angel
and neutralised... by Unit One.

999
01:17:30,438 --> 01:17:31,731
What?

1000
01:17:42,492 --> 01:17:44,827
[Ibuki]
Unit One link circuits have been cut.

1001
01:17:45,244 --> 01:17:47,205
- And the ejection signal?
- Negative, sir.

1002
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:50,249
- Our orders are not getting through.
- He's locked himself in the unit.

1003
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:54,170
Stop this, Shinji! Try to think about
what you're doing here, please!

1004
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:57,715
[Shinji] That's a bad idea.
 Do you wanna make me angrier?

1005
01:17:58,091 --> 01:18:01,969
Unit One still has 285 seconds left
 of internal power.

1006
01:18:02,053 --> 01:18:05,098
- That's enough to level half of HQ.
- In his current state of mind,

1007
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:07,392
- it's very possible.
- Please! It's Ibuki!

1008
01:18:07,475 --> 01:18:10,311
Listen to me. If the commander
had not made that call,

1009
01:18:10,395 --> 01:18:12,480
you're the one who would have died
in that fight!

1010
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:15,942
- That has nothing to do with this.
- Whether you like it or not, it's true!

1011
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:18,903
I just told you
that has nothing to do with this!

1012
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:23,408
Father! That monster tried to kill Asuka!

1013
01:18:23,491 --> 01:18:24,492
And...

1014
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:26,744
he used me to do it!

1015
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:31,290
Why? Why? Why did you do this?

1016
01:18:31,999 --> 01:18:34,377
You don't understand anything!

1017
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:37,088
I was an idiot for ever believing in you!

1018
01:18:37,171 --> 01:18:40,007
I wish you'd lose someone
 that you care about!

1019
01:18:40,091 --> 01:18:41,509
Then you'd know what it's like!

1020
01:18:41,592 --> 01:18:44,679
[Gendoh] Increase LCL pressure
to maximum allowable levels.

1021
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:47,765
I don't have time
for his childish tantrums.

1022
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:50,852
You can cut off power,
but I still control --

1023
01:18:53,312 --> 01:18:55,148
Ah! Damn it!

1024
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:59,110
Damn it! Damn it...

1025
01:19:17,336 --> 01:19:21,257
[Rei] Shinji,
you're always listening to that device.

1026
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:25,136
Um... Yes, this used to belong
to my father, years ago.

1027
01:19:25,386 --> 01:19:27,555
[young Shinji]
It's like Ayanami's glasses.

1028
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:30,349
Father left it behind
once he didn't need it any more.

1029
01:19:30,433 --> 01:19:33,978
- [young Shinji] Just like he did with me.
- Then someone else looked after me.

1030
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:35,730
So I kept it.

1031
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:38,816
When you wall off your ears,
you wall off your heart,

1032
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:41,402
so you don't have to deal
with the cruel world.

1033
01:19:41,652 --> 01:19:44,780
- [Rei] The cruel world?
- Yes.

1034
01:19:44,864 --> 01:19:47,200
The world of the father
that I hate.

1035
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:51,954
The world of scary Angels and Evas,
where I'm forced to do terrible things

1036
01:19:52,038 --> 01:19:55,166
and where Father doesn't need me
because of that Dummy System.

1037
01:19:55,249 --> 01:19:57,877
A world where my friends and I
keep getting hurt.

1038
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:03,591
I had some nice things happen too,
but they're always ruined in the end.

1039
01:20:03,674 --> 01:20:06,093
It's a cruel world.

1040
01:20:06,177 --> 01:20:08,304
Now I'm throwing this thing away.

1041
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:12,308
I thought Father would protect me from
the cruel world if I kept it with me.

1042
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:15,311
But I was simply lying to myself.

1043
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:19,273
Did you ever try
to understand your father, Shinji?

1044
01:20:19,524 --> 01:20:21,859
- I tried to understand.
- Really?

1045
01:20:21,943 --> 01:20:25,988
- You didn't do anything, did you?
- I tried to! I did!

1046
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:30,243
It's all Father's fault!
Father is the one who abandoned me!

1047
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:32,453
[young Shinji] So I see that, again,

1048
01:20:32,537 --> 01:20:34,997
you want to run away
from whatever can hurt you.

1049
01:20:35,081 --> 01:20:40,086
So what? What's wrong
with leaving behind the pain and misery?

1050
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:45,383
I'm back here again.

1051
01:20:46,968 --> 01:20:48,219
I've had enough of this.

1052
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:54,892
[overlapping operator voices]

1053
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:10,199
[Ritsuko] On a cellular level,
I see no trace of residual corruption.

1054
01:21:10,575 --> 01:21:13,536
But it is possible
that her very mind was infiltrated.

1055
01:21:13,911 --> 01:21:16,372
We have to keep her in quarantine for now.

1056
01:21:16,455 --> 01:21:19,166
[Ibuki] Doctor,
they won't neutralise her, will they?

1057
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:22,878
They would never do harm to Asuka.
She's a priceless specimen.

1058
01:21:25,756 --> 01:21:29,594
You may leave, Shinji Ikari.
Commander Ikari will see you now.

1059
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:37,435
[Gendoh] Insubordination. Personal use
of an Eva. Threats and tantrums.

1060
01:21:37,518 --> 01:21:40,229
Do you realise
the seriousness of your crimes?

1061
01:21:40,313 --> 01:21:42,648
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

1062
01:21:42,732 --> 01:21:46,611
Yes. I never want to pilot an Eva again.

1063
01:21:46,694 --> 01:21:49,322
I see. Then get out.

1064
01:21:52,199 --> 01:21:54,160
Are you running away again?

1065
01:21:56,412 --> 01:21:59,040
You can only realise
your desires and dreams

1066
01:21:59,123 --> 01:22:02,168
through hard work and many sacrifices.

1067
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:04,378
No one will do it for you.

1068
01:22:05,004 --> 01:22:07,465
Shinji, grow up.

1069
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:12,011
I don't understand
what it means to be a grown-up.

1070
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:24,690
[Gendoh] It's me.
 Delete the Third Boy from the system.

1071
01:22:24,774 --> 01:22:28,402
From now on, Unit One
 will be operated by the Dummy System.

1072
01:22:28,486 --> 01:22:30,529
There is no need for a backup.

1073
01:22:31,781 --> 01:22:34,784
[Ibuki]
So, Rei didn't stop Shinji from leaving.

1074
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:38,079
[Hyuga] She seemed different lately,
so I had hoped that she would.

1075
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:41,123
It's hard to gauge
where these kids stand with each other.

1076
01:22:41,207 --> 01:22:43,501
[Aoba]
Well, we're back to just one pilot now.

1077
01:22:44,627 --> 01:22:46,879
Back to square one... I guess.

1078
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:57,807
[Misato] You do realise
that even though you've left NERV

1079
01:22:57,890 --> 01:23:00,059
and been struck from the rosters

1080
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:02,978
your actions
will still be monitored and restricted?

1081
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:05,231
You forgot this.

1082
01:23:05,898 --> 01:23:10,486
Tohji and Kensuke left several messages
for you. They're worried about you.

1083
01:23:10,861 --> 01:23:12,154
I don't need it.

1084
01:23:12,738 --> 01:23:14,156
I left it on purpose.

1085
01:23:14,699 --> 01:23:17,618
And you don't want to know
what's going on with Rei and Asuka?

1086
01:23:20,121 --> 01:23:23,916
Honestly,
maybe the fate of humanity and the world

1087
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:25,584
don't mean that much to me, either.

1088
01:23:26,961 --> 01:23:30,548
Even though I am now
Operations Director at NERV,

1089
01:23:30,631 --> 01:23:33,509
at first, I joined the organisation

1090
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:36,721
because I wanted
to get closer to my dead father.

1091
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:41,892
Just like you became an Eva pilot
because your father needed you.

1092
01:23:43,811 --> 01:23:48,482
Because of that, I think I projected
my own hopes and dreams onto you.

1093
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:52,528
I also know they must have felt
like a weight around your neck.

1094
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:56,198
And I realise you're disappointed
and disillusioned about the Evas.

1095
01:23:56,741 --> 01:23:59,493
But still, I just wanted you to know...

1096
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:11,297
Rei had invited Commander Ikari
to the dinner party, that day.

1097
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:15,509
She wanted to give you a chance
to get closer to him.

1098
01:24:16,761 --> 01:24:18,763
She wanted to see you laugh together.

1099
01:24:20,181 --> 01:24:23,768
I'll never laugh again.
Not ever, with anyone.

1100
01:24:28,814 --> 01:24:35,029
[tannoy] Next stop. Kamigoura. Kamigoura.
 Please exit on the left-hand side.

1101
01:24:37,573 --> 01:24:41,702
[PA woman] Attention. A state of emergency
 has just been declared by the Government.

1102
01:24:41,786 --> 01:24:46,582
Following emergency regulations, this
 train will stop at the nearest shelter.

1103
01:24:47,124 --> 01:24:52,087
Once at the station, please exit the train
 and board the incline train.

1104
01:24:52,171 --> 01:24:53,172
Another Angel.

1105
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:57,134
[operator] Eva Unit Two's containment
 measures have been unlocked.

1106
01:24:57,218 --> 01:24:59,512
We are currently opening up Silo Two.

1107
01:25:00,763 --> 01:25:03,015
Atchoo! So cold.

1108
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:05,768
OK, then.

1109
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:11,899
I like my new plug suit. The colour's
great and the fit is just... perfect!

1110
01:25:18,989 --> 01:25:20,783
[Kaworu] The time has come.

1111
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:25,287
[operator woman] All personnel.
 Battle Stations, condition one.

1112
01:25:25,371 --> 01:25:27,665
- Target status?
- It's approaching rapidly, sir.

1113
01:25:27,748 --> 01:25:30,251
[Aoba] Kyu-Odawara defence line breached!

1114
01:25:53,566 --> 01:25:56,944
That must have been a massive explosion.
I felt it down here!

1115
01:25:57,027 --> 01:25:59,905
[man] Southern block.
 All ground facilities collapsed.

1116
01:25:59,989 --> 01:26:02,741
- Surface armour plates have melted!
- It destroyed 24 layers

1117
01:26:02,825 --> 01:26:05,911
- of reinforced armour in one strike?
- The Tenth Angel.

1118
01:26:05,995 --> 01:26:08,289
The most powerful Refusal Type.

1119
01:26:08,372 --> 01:26:10,332
It's even more formidable
than we thought.

1120
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:15,421
Go all out! Direct every ordnance
this fortress city has on that thing!

1121
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:17,798
Just buy us time! Every minute counts!

1122
01:26:21,051 --> 01:26:23,387
Eva Unit two? Who's piloting it?

1123
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:26,849
[Hyuga] Pilot unknown!
 The launch order did not come from us!

1124
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:44,867
- [woman] Second barrage ineffective!
- Drop that! Prioritise civilian evac!

1125
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:47,912
Launch third wave of N2 guided missiles!
Give us fire support!

1126
01:26:47,995 --> 01:26:50,289
It's too late
for a surface Eva Interception.

1127
01:26:50,372 --> 01:26:51,916
Send a request to the Euro Branch!

1128
01:26:51,999 --> 01:26:54,501
Station Unit Two in the Geofront!
Status of Unit Zero?

1129
01:26:54,585 --> 01:26:57,296
Left-arm repairs ongoing!
It's barely operational!

1130
01:26:57,379 --> 01:27:01,050
Get it ready! And send it to support
Unit Two! They need backup to fight this!

1131
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:02,885
- Copy that!
- Status of Unit One?

1132
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:04,887
Preparing activation
with the Dummy System!

1133
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:06,388
Try to expedite the process.

1134
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:12,895
[evacuee man] That last one
was in the city centre, right?

1135
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:15,105
[evacuee man 2]
The Geofront shelter is up ahead.

1136
01:27:15,189 --> 01:27:16,982
It's the safest place in the world.

1137
01:27:21,737 --> 01:27:22,947
[alarm goes off]

1138
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:25,074
Colonel! Target has entered the Geofront!

1139
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:27,743
- Eva Unit Two ready to engage!
- Do we have comms with Unit Two?

1140
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:31,455
No. Comm link relay has been disabled!
Can't contact pilot!

1141
01:27:31,538 --> 01:27:35,459
I see.
So that pilot wants to do it alone.

1142
01:27:42,508 --> 01:27:43,926
What a wonderful smell.

1143
01:27:44,009 --> 01:27:46,637
I don't mind an Eva
that smells of another pilot.

1144
01:27:48,013 --> 01:27:50,057
It's breached the fifth defence perimeter.

1145
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:53,227
So I'm gonna have to wrap this up quick,
or HQ is toast!

1146
01:27:59,233 --> 01:28:00,776
[groans]

1147
01:28:10,577 --> 01:28:13,122
Oh, man! Its AT Field is much too strong!

1148
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:15,541
I'll never get anywhere near it
from way out here!

1149
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:17,042
Right!

1150
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:23,007
Let's see how you like that! Yah!

1151
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:28,804
[battle cry]

1152
01:28:34,852 --> 01:28:36,645
Nothing like point-blank!

1153
01:28:38,355 --> 01:28:40,065
Oh?

1154
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:55,831
Oh, crap!

1155
01:29:02,212 --> 01:29:05,132
Little bastard! A real ballbuster.

1156
01:29:05,382 --> 01:29:07,217
[woman] Dummy System connect complete.

1157
01:29:07,301 --> 01:29:09,303
- Begin contact sequence.
- Roger.

1158
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:12,765
- What is it?
- The Core Unit won't accept the Dummy!

1159
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:16,560
System shutdown!
Eva Unit One will not activate!

1160
01:29:17,978 --> 01:29:24,359
- It's rejecting the Dummy System.
- Fuyutsuki, take charge while I'm gone.

1161
01:29:24,443 --> 01:29:29,031
Let's see where we are here.
I'll never win like this.

1162
01:29:30,491 --> 01:29:32,159
Time for a plan B.

1163
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:36,872
What can this Eva do
when it's free from its humanity?

1164
01:29:37,289 --> 01:29:41,502
Launch invert mode. Enter secret code.
"The Beast".

1165
01:29:52,513 --> 01:29:55,933
Try to hold it together, Eva Unit Two...

1166
01:29:56,016 --> 01:29:57,601
And I promise that I'll do the same!

1167
01:30:02,773 --> 01:30:06,443
- Evas are capable of that?
- [Ibuki] All restrictors disengaged.

1168
01:30:06,527 --> 01:30:10,239
Readings have jumped off the scale!
Interior monitoring disabled!

1169
01:30:10,322 --> 01:30:12,324
The plug has dived
into negative depth.

1170
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:14,827
The pilot risks
irreversible contamination.

1171
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:17,412
We have to stop this! It's too dangerous!

1172
01:30:17,496 --> 01:30:20,874
Sometimes, you have to risk everything

1173
01:30:20,958 --> 01:30:23,585
in order to win

1174
01:30:23,669 --> 01:30:27,923
what you really want!

1175
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:44,022
Yah!

1176
01:30:47,985 --> 01:30:50,362
Just a little more!

1177
01:31:05,586 --> 01:31:07,254
[drowning]

1178
01:31:08,922 --> 01:31:10,424
[battle cry]

1179
01:31:21,185 --> 01:31:23,270
The second form of the Eva,
the Beast state.

1180
01:31:23,353 --> 01:31:26,398
It purged itself of its humanity
and turned into a berserker.

1181
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:28,567
There's nothing we can do.

1182
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:33,113
Unit Zero?
That's not a rifle it's carrying!

1183
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:39,870
- What is she doing?
- Stop! Right now! Stop, Rei! Rei!

1184
01:31:45,125 --> 01:31:46,627
AT Field... full power!

1185
01:31:49,671 --> 01:31:51,423
Got to make sure... Shinji...

1186
01:31:52,716 --> 01:31:55,344
will never have to pilot an Eva again.

1187
01:31:55,636 --> 01:31:56,762
Whatever the cost.

1188
01:32:08,774 --> 01:32:11,860
She cannot make it.
No Eva can breach that AT Field alone.

1189
01:32:19,785 --> 01:32:23,747
OK, Unit Two,
it's time for your last hurrah!

1190
01:32:25,207 --> 01:32:27,793
Come on! Just one more!

1191
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:39,846
Unit Two, please move away. Thank you.

1192
01:32:48,897 --> 01:32:51,191
[cries of anguish]

1193
01:32:52,317 --> 01:32:53,652
What happened to Unit Zero?

1194
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:11,920
[woman] This shelter
 has now been declared unsafe.

1195
01:33:12,004 --> 01:33:15,090
Please evacuate immediately
 to a secure shelter.

1196
01:33:15,382 --> 01:33:17,259
I repeat, this shelter has been...

1197
01:33:24,725 --> 01:33:26,435
[groans]

1198
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:31,106
I thought I bought the farm, on that one!

1199
01:33:31,898 --> 01:33:38,280
Oh, no way! What are you doing here?
So that's why we were missing an Eva?

1200
01:33:40,699 --> 01:33:45,579
Yes, I... I made up my mind.
I'm never piloting again.

1201
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:51,793
Oh, wow, so you're losing sleep
over whether or not to pilot an Eva,

1202
01:33:51,877 --> 01:33:55,964
is that it? In that case,
you need to get out of here.

1203
01:33:56,465 --> 01:33:58,592
Wait. Let me help you.

1204
01:34:03,013 --> 01:34:06,224
I decided I'll never pilot again!
I decided I'll never pilot again!

1205
01:34:06,308 --> 01:34:07,851
I'll never pilot again!

1206
01:34:07,934 --> 01:34:13,815
[Mari] But, you know, fretting over that
kind of stuff tends to make life less fun.

1207
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:48,850
[chewing]

1208
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:01,238
[Ritsuko] An Angel... devouring an Eva!

1209
01:35:01,321 --> 01:35:03,573
- That's impossible!
- [Ibuki] That's not all!

1210
01:35:03,657 --> 01:35:06,910
The target's ID signal
is morphing into Unit Zero's signal!

1211
01:35:06,993 --> 01:35:11,248
Then we're screwed! Dogma's self-destruct
mechanism won't see it as an enemy!

1212
01:35:11,331 --> 01:35:13,166
That thing can walk right up to Lilith!

1213
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:16,586
[Mari]
The Angel is merging with Unit Zero.

1214
01:35:16,670 --> 01:35:19,673
It absorbed the whole thing,
pilot and all!

1215
01:35:20,841 --> 01:35:25,554
If you stay, you'll die.
Hurry, get out of here!

1216
01:35:36,773 --> 01:35:38,900
Oh, boy... there he goes.

1217
01:35:39,985 --> 01:35:42,237
[panting]

1218
01:36:04,134 --> 01:36:07,262
Final layer of protective armour
has been completely destroyed!

1219
01:36:07,345 --> 01:36:10,515
Oh, crap, no!
Now the main shaft is exposed!

1220
01:36:10,599 --> 01:36:11,683
What about Unit One?

1221
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:17,272
[man] Entry plug insertion failure.

1222
01:36:17,355 --> 01:36:20,192
- Dummy system is refusing --
- Resetting the systems didn't work!

1223
01:36:20,275 --> 01:36:23,445
Keep trying.
Restart procedure from line 3-0-8.

1224
01:36:23,528 --> 01:36:26,907
- [woman] 3-0-9, checking initiated.
- Why now?

1225
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:29,201
Why are you refusing me?

1226
01:36:29,284 --> 01:36:30,368
Yui!

1227
01:36:30,452 --> 01:36:32,162
- [Shinji] Let me get on board!
- Hmm?

1228
01:36:32,746 --> 01:36:37,334
Please! Please!
Let me pilot Unit One once more!

1229
01:36:41,463 --> 01:36:43,256
[Gendoh] What are you doing here?

1230
01:36:46,176 --> 01:36:50,472
Father!
I am here because I'm Shinji Ikari,

1231
01:36:50,555 --> 01:36:54,309
pilot of Evangelion Unit One!

1232
01:36:56,770 --> 01:36:59,439
Target is currently descending
toward terminal Dogma.

1233
01:36:59,523 --> 01:37:01,816
[operator]
 Target has passed Layer Seven.

1234
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:05,320
Target approaching!
Non-combatant personnel, evacuate!

1235
01:37:20,293 --> 01:37:21,378
Eva Unit One?

1236
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:23,547
Shinji came!

1237
01:37:25,549 --> 01:37:26,800
[battle cry]

1238
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:38,061
Aaah!

1239
01:37:43,108 --> 01:37:44,568
[battle cry]

1240
01:37:46,528 --> 01:37:48,905
- Miss Misato!
- Disengage elevator safeties!

1241
01:38:17,017 --> 01:38:18,268
I have no power left?

1242
01:38:18,351 --> 01:38:21,813
Unit One reached it operational limit!
Power reserve depleted!

1243
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:22,897
No! Shinji!

1244
01:38:31,281 --> 01:38:32,824
[gasp]

1245
01:38:39,706 --> 01:38:40,707
Shinji, no!

1246
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:50,425
Ayanami... Give her back!

1247
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:57,307
The Eva is moving!
But it's past its operational limit!

1248
01:38:59,517 --> 01:39:02,020
- Has it gone berserk?
- I can't tell you for sure.

1249
01:39:02,687 --> 01:39:04,939
I have no idea
what's going on with Unit One.

1250
01:39:51,736 --> 01:39:53,279
What the hell? An Eva can do that?

1251
01:39:53,738 --> 01:39:56,741
Unit One has transcended
all human limitations.

1252
01:39:57,450 --> 01:40:01,121
Plug depth now over 1.80!
This is too dangerous!

1253
01:40:01,204 --> 01:40:04,249
Shinji, stop it, please!
You'll lose your humanity!

1254
01:40:05,625 --> 01:40:10,338
[Shinji] I don't care what happens to me.
I don't care what happens to this world.

1255
01:40:10,422 --> 01:40:12,632
But I won't let Ayanami go.

1256
01:40:12,716 --> 01:40:16,302
I'm gonna bring her back,
no matter what!

1257
01:40:30,233 --> 01:40:32,318
- Yes, do it, Shinji!
- Misato!

1258
01:40:34,112 --> 01:40:35,447
Do this for yourself!

1259
01:40:36,906 --> 01:40:39,117
Do it to make your wish come true!

1260
01:40:50,545 --> 01:40:53,047
Ayanami! Where are you?

1261
01:40:53,965 --> 01:40:58,887
[Rei] It's too late.
Now, I can only live here, inside.

1262
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:00,096
Ayanami!

1263
01:41:00,805 --> 01:41:02,515
[Rei] It's OK, Shinji.

1264
01:41:02,599 --> 01:41:05,101
Even when I'm gone,
others can replace me.

1265
01:41:05,185 --> 01:41:07,479
- Others can replace me.
- No, they can't!

1266
01:41:07,562 --> 01:41:10,023
- There's only one Ayanami!
- Oh?

1267
01:41:10,106 --> 01:41:12,609
That's why I'm coming for you!

1268
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:34,506
What's going on? The Eva's
physical regulators are disappearing.

1269
01:41:34,589 --> 01:41:35,882
I'm not getting any data!

1270
01:41:35,965 --> 01:41:40,970
Finally freed from its humanoid limits,
it's reverting back to its original form.

1271
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:46,142
Emancipated from human bondage, it's
transforming itself into a divine entity,

1272
01:41:46,226 --> 01:41:47,811
beyond the reach of mortals.

1273
01:41:48,144 --> 01:41:50,480
In the swells of complementarity,

1274
01:41:50,563 --> 01:41:53,191
it's finally binding together the Heavens,

1275
01:41:53,274 --> 01:41:56,820
the Earth and all Creation,
merging them into a pure energy.

1276
01:41:58,822 --> 01:42:02,867
Just to make one human's wish come true
and nothing more..

1277
01:42:03,868 --> 01:42:06,287
[straining and screaming]

1278
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:33,940
Ayanami!

1279
01:42:51,791 --> 01:42:54,752
- Ayanami!
- Oh!

1280
01:42:54,836 --> 01:42:57,338
[straining]

1281
01:43:13,897 --> 01:43:15,815
Ayanami! Give me...

1282
01:43:20,528 --> 01:43:21,863
your hand!

1283
01:43:56,397 --> 01:43:59,734
[Kaji] Unit One is now the awakening
trigger, ahead of all the rest.

1284
01:44:01,235 --> 01:44:05,156
Beware, Commander.
We should expect a reaction from SEELE.

1285
01:44:06,074 --> 01:44:10,119
Just as we thought. These two were enough
to launch the awakening of Unit One.

1286
01:44:10,203 --> 01:44:15,833
[Gendoh] Yes. Now we won't have to wait
too long for our plans to come true.

1287
01:44:20,338 --> 01:44:24,300
[Shinji] I want to thank you
for trying to help me with my father.

1288
01:44:25,551 --> 01:44:28,513
[Rei] I'm sorry. I couldn't do anything.

1289
01:44:29,597 --> 01:44:30,974
No need to be sorry.

1290
01:44:32,892 --> 01:44:34,018
It's fine.

1291
01:44:42,986 --> 01:44:47,073
Oh! So now I see.
This guy gets all the breaks.

1292
01:44:47,699 --> 01:44:52,328
Maybe it's because
he smells so nice. Atchoo!

1293
01:45:23,609 --> 01:45:26,738
We're witnessing the birth
of a new life-form that's broken free

1294
01:45:26,821 --> 01:45:27,989
of this world's logos.

1295
01:45:29,032 --> 01:45:32,535
And the price to pay is the death
of all previous life-forms.

1296
01:45:38,458 --> 01:45:42,003
Those wings... Just like 15 years ago.

1297
01:45:43,796 --> 01:45:47,258
[Ritsuko] Yes. It's the continuation
of the Second Impact.

1298
01:45:47,341 --> 01:45:49,260
The Third Impact is beginning.

1299
01:45:50,803 --> 01:45:52,221
It's the end of the world.

1300
01:51:13,167 --> 01:51:14,377
What just happened?

1301
01:51:19,298 --> 01:51:22,593
At last, the appointed time
has come, Shinji Ikari.

1302
01:51:24,011 --> 01:51:28,557
And this time, I'll make sure
you're happy, no matter what.

1303
01:51:32,186 --> 01:51:35,064
[Misato] Eva Unit One is locked down,
with Rei and Shinji inside!

1304
01:51:35,147 --> 01:51:38,943
The fortress city is in ruins.
NERV HQ personnel is held captive.

1305
01:51:39,276 --> 01:51:41,362
Unit Six descends into Dogma!

1306
01:51:41,445 --> 01:51:44,198
And the Quickening
of Eva Unit Eight and its pilot!

1307
01:51:44,281 --> 01:51:48,035
The children with predetermined
fates gather at last!

1308
01:51:48,119 --> 01:51:50,329
Where will the story
of these survivors lead them?

1309
01:51:50,955 --> 01:51:54,333
Next time!
In Evangelion:3.33

1310
01:51:54,417 --> 01:51:58,212
That's our cue! Get ready for all that,
plus many surprises... coming up!
