1
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:44,294
Sophie, we just closed the shop. You've done enough work.

2
00:01:44,377 --> 00:01:46,317
Why don't you come out with us this time?

3
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:49,718
No, I'd better finish this. You go and have fun.

4
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,332
All right, suit yourself.

5
00:01:52,928 --> 00:01:54,054
Let's go, girls.

6
00:01:54,137 --> 00:01:54,566
Wait for me!

7
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:55,454
I'm ready.

8
00:01:55,514 --> 00:01:56,599
Do I look okay?

9
00:01:56,624 --> 00:01:58,332
Oh! It's Howl's castle!

10
00:01:58,391 --> 00:01:58,833
Where?

11
00:01:58,858 --> 00:01:59,375
Howl?

12
00:01:59,434 --> 00:02:02,504
I've never seen it close!

13
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,942
Do you think Howl will go into town?

14
00:02:12,447 --> 00:02:13,395
He's gone.

15
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:16,247
No, he's just hiding in the fog from those planes.

16
00:02:16,368 --> 00:02:19,204
Did you hear what happened to
that girl Martha from south haven?

17
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:21,248
They say Howl tore her heart out.

18
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:22,896
I'm too scared to go out!

19
00:02:22,956 --> 00:02:23,475
What?

20
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,835
Don't worry, he only preys on pretty girls.

21
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:29,089
All right, let's go.

22
00:02:29,172 --> 00:02:30,479
You girls are mean.

23
00:02:31,244 --> 00:02:33,003
It's not funny.

24
00:04:35,288 --> 00:04:38,062
Hey. Looks like a little mouse lost its way.

25
00:04:38,327 --> 00:04:40,255
Oh, no, I'm not lost.

26
00:04:40,345 --> 00:04:44,114
This little mouse looks thirsty.
We should take her for a cup of tea.

27
00:04:44,265 --> 00:04:46,236
No, thanks, my sister's expecting me.

28
00:04:46,292 --> 00:04:48,436
She's pretty cute for a mouse.

29
00:04:48,595 --> 00:04:51,043
How old are you anyway? You live around here?

30
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,781
Leave me alone.

31
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,071
You see? Your moustache scares all the girls.

32
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:58,582
So? I think she's even cuter when she's scared.

33
00:04:58,947 --> 00:05:00,344
There you are, sweetheart.

34
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:02,816
Sorry I'm late. I was looking everywhere for you.

35
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:04,219
Hey, we're busy here.

36
00:05:04,244 --> 00:05:05,328
Are you really?

37
00:05:05,412 --> 00:05:08,140
It looked to me like the two of you were just leaving.

38
00:05:09,249 --> 00:05:10,244
Hup!

39
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:11,310
Hup!

40
00:05:11,422 --> 00:05:13,081
<i>Whoa!</i>

41
00:05:16,131 --> 00:05:19,675
Don't hold it against them.
They're actually not all that bad.

42
00:05:19,968 --> 00:05:23,203
Where to? I'll be your escort this evening.

43
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:26,213
Oh, I'm, um, just going to the bakery.

44
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:28,351
Don't get alarmed, but I'm being followed.

45
00:05:28,435 --> 00:05:29,717
Act normal.

46
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:53,282
Sorry. Looks like you're involved.

47
00:05:57,255 --> 00:05:58,352
This way.

48
00:06:06,092 --> 00:06:07,137
Hold on.

49
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,743
Now, straighten your legs and start walking.

50
00:06:19,874 --> 00:06:22,332
See? Not so hard, is it?

51
00:06:38,196 --> 00:06:39,594
You are a natural.

52
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:56,238
I'll make sure I've draw them off.

53
00:06:56,397 --> 00:06:58,605
But wait a bit before you head back outside.

54
00:06:58,986 --> 00:06:59,623
Okay.

55
00:07:00,777 --> 00:07:02,348
That's my girl.

56
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:14,314
Excuse me, could we trouble you for some more coffee?

57
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:15,291
There you go.

58
00:07:15,316 --> 00:07:16,076
Do you have any Lettie-shaped cookies?

59
00:07:16,108 --> 00:07:17,596
I'd like buy some those.

60
00:07:17,818 --> 00:07:18,532
Here.

61
00:07:18,713 --> 00:07:20,271
What time do you get off?

62
00:07:20,296 --> 00:07:21,297
She what?

63
00:07:22,688 --> 00:07:24,062
Hey! I'm over here, what're you doing?

64
00:07:24,087 --> 00:07:24,801
Hey!

65
00:07:28,234 --> 00:07:29,282
Sophie?

66
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:30,784
Lettie.

67
00:07:30,809 --> 00:07:31,741
What's going on?

68
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:34,519
Someone just told me you floated down onto our balcony.

69
00:07:35,312 --> 00:07:37,623
So that did happen. It wasn't a dream.

70
00:07:37,648 --> 00:07:39,944
Lettie, would you like to use my office?

71
00:07:40,118 --> 00:07:43,081
I should really get back to work. Thank you, though.

72
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:47,658
Wow. He must have been a wizard, then.

73
00:07:48,795 --> 00:07:50,247
But he was so kind to me.

74
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:52,956
He rescued me, Lettie.

75
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:56,285
Of course he did. He was trying to steal your heart!

76
00:07:56,798 --> 00:07:58,685
You are so lucky, Sophie.

77
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,099
If that wizard were Howl, he would have eaten it.

78
00:08:01,395 --> 00:08:04,983
No, he wouldn't. Howl only does that to beautiful girls.

79
00:08:05,008 --> 00:08:06,661
Don't give me that.

80
00:08:06,844 --> 00:08:09,943
You need to be more careful. It's dangerous out there.

81
00:08:10,165 --> 00:08:13,074
Even the Witch of the Waste is back on the prowl.

82
00:08:14,464 --> 00:08:15,648
Are you listening?

83
00:08:16,085 --> 00:08:16,767
Huh?

84
00:08:17,395 --> 00:08:18,348
Ugh!

85
00:08:21,494 --> 00:08:23,878
Lettie, the chocolate eclairs are done.

86
00:08:24,354 --> 00:08:25,962
Okay. I'll be right there.

87
00:08:25,987 --> 00:08:26,785
Thanks.

88
00:08:28,865 --> 00:08:30,633
All right. I'd better get going then.

89
00:08:30,658 --> 00:08:33,046
I just wanted to make sure that you were doing okay.

90
00:08:35,163 --> 00:08:36,154
Hello, Lettie.

91
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,439
Hi, how are you doing?

92
00:08:37,704 --> 00:08:41,667
Sophie, do you really want to spend
the rest of your life in that hat shop?

93
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:44,923
The shop was just so important to Father.

94
00:08:44,974 --> 00:08:46,566
And I'm the eldest, I don't mind.

95
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,786
I'm not asking what Father would have wanted.

96
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:50,725
I want to know what you want.

97
00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:51,852
Well...

98
00:08:52,358 --> 00:08:53,521
See you later, Lettie.

99
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:54,950
Good seeing you again.

100
00:08:54,975 --> 00:08:55,784
You, too.

101
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,136
I'd better be going.

102
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:58,536
It's your life, Sophie.

103
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:00,419
Do something for yourself for once. Will you?

104
00:09:00,444 --> 00:09:01,220
Bye, Lettie.

105
00:10:08,923 --> 00:10:11,168
I'm sorry, but the shop's closed now, ma'am.

106
00:10:11,232 --> 00:10:14,115
I could have sworn I locked
that door. Must have forgotten.

107
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:21,209
What a tacky shop. I've never seen such tacky little hats.

108
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:25,318
Yet you're by far the tackiest thing in here.

109
00:10:26,441 --> 00:10:28,835
I'm afraid you will have to leave now.

110
00:10:34,615 --> 00:10:37,178
The door's over here, ma'am. We're closed.

111
00:10:38,162 --> 00:10:41,921
Standing up to the Witch of the Waste, that's plucky.

112
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:43,686
The Witch of the Waste?

113
00:10:51,345 --> 00:10:54,522
The best part of that spell is
you can't tell anyone about it.

114
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:56,747
My regards to Howl.

115
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:22,614
Oh. No.

116
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:24,669
Oh!

117
00:11:43,505 --> 00:11:47,761
That's really me, isn't it? I've got to stay calm.

118
00:12:05,002 --> 00:12:06,716
I've got to stay calm!

119
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,657
Now, there's no use panicking, Sophie. Oh!

120
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:14,425
It's a bad dream, that's all. Just go inside, go to bed.

121
00:12:14,897 --> 00:12:18,341
You're gonna be fine, Sophie. You're gonna be fine.

122
00:12:19,053 --> 00:12:20,672
Got to stay calm.

123
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,707
Look who's here!

124
00:12:32,732 --> 00:12:33,850
You're back! There she is!

125
00:12:33,876 --> 00:12:35,899
Welcome to home,ma'am Look at you!

126
00:12:35,924 --> 00:12:38,632
What do you think? It's all the rage in Kingsbury.

127
00:12:38,854 --> 00:12:40,091
It's gorgeous!

128
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:43,272
I know ! Our customers will love it ! Sophie !

129
00:12:43,578 --> 00:12:44,867
Sophie ?

130
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:47,974
I'm afraid your daughter hasn't
come downstairs yet today, ma'am.

131
00:12:48,046 --> 00:12:50,208
That's strange. I wonder what's wrong.

132
00:12:52,545 --> 00:12:53,966
Sophie !

133
00:12:56,122 --> 00:12:57,457
Sophie !

134
00:12:58,537 --> 00:13:00,831
Sophie !

135
00:13:00,887 --> 00:13:07,195
Don't come in here. I've got a bad
cold. I don't want you to catch it.

136
00:13:07,935 --> 00:13:11,691
You sound ghastly, like some 90-year-old woman.

137
00:13:11,806 --> 00:13:14,684
I'll just stay in bed all day, so you go on.

138
00:13:14,726 --> 00:13:18,094
Well, if you insist.

139
00:13:19,582 --> 00:13:21,391
Up we go.

140
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:36,313
This isn't so bad, now, is it?
You're still in pretty good shape.

141
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,815
And your clothes finally suit you.

142
00:13:41,135 --> 00:13:43,645
But you can't stay here like this for long.

143
00:13:54,357 --> 00:13:58,778
Oh! Being old is worse than I thought.

144
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:05,860
They say their prince is missing.

145
00:14:05,885 --> 00:14:07,790
And they're blaming us.

146
00:14:08,162 --> 00:14:10,945
Yeah, and it sounds like they're gonna start a war.

147
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,793
Nobody wants to go to war.

148
00:14:13,876 --> 00:14:15,294
Let's hope the prince turns up soon.

149
00:14:23,177 --> 00:14:25,192
Excuse me, could you use some help?

150
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:29,481
I'll be fine, but thanks for
offering. That was really kind.

151
00:14:30,184 --> 00:14:33,024
Sure, there's room in back if
you like, but where are you headed?

152
00:14:33,222 --> 00:14:35,971
Just a little ways farther than where you're going.

153
00:14:40,731 --> 00:14:42,701
You're crazy if you do this, Grandma!

154
00:14:43,281 --> 00:14:45,658
There's nothing but witches and wizards out there!

155
00:14:45,741 --> 00:14:48,119
Thank you. I'll keep that in mind.

156
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,297
She's going to the Wastes by herself?

157
00:14:50,354 --> 00:14:52,513
She says she's looking for her younger sister.

158
00:15:07,497 --> 00:15:09,706
I'll never get there with these legs.

159
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,306
At least my teeth haven't fallen out yet.

160
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:26,461
That would make a nice cane. Up we go.

161
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,429
Oh.

162
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:34,979
Might be too big.

163
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:47,896
This is one stubborn branch.

164
00:15:49,804 --> 00:15:52,711
You're not getting the best of this old lady.

165
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,354
Oh!

166
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,886
Just a scarecrow!

167
00:16:06,947 --> 00:16:09,309
I was afraid you were one of those blob men.

168
00:16:09,742 --> 00:16:12,804
But how're you standing on your own like that?

169
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:17,293
Your head's a turnip.

170
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,828
I've always hated turnips, ever since I was little.

171
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:23,395
At least you're not upside down now.

172
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:24,992
So long.

173
00:16:32,362 --> 00:16:34,056
It's too cold.

174
00:16:34,725 --> 00:16:37,774
And I can still see the town. I've barely moved.

175
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,015
Hmm?

176
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,794
Go away! Quit following me!

177
00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:47,655
There's no need to thank me, you don't owe me a thing.

178
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,383
I'm sure you have some kind of spell on you,

179
00:16:50,408 --> 00:16:53,035
and I've had more than enough of witches and spells.

180
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:56,525
So, just go find some field and stand in it!

181
00:17:17,217 --> 00:17:20,565
Thank you, this cane is perfect, it's just what I need.

182
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,748
If you'd like to do me one more favor,

183
00:17:22,773 --> 00:17:25,576
you could run off and find me a place to stay.

184
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:39,082
I seem to become quite cunning in my old age.

185
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:52,304
A battleship! Oh!

186
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:56,395
Why do you get so cold when you're old?

187
00:17:56,474 --> 00:18:00,408
I'm fatter than ever, yet the wind blows right through me.

188
00:18:14,965 --> 00:18:19,419
Someone's got a fire going. Maybe there's a cabin nearby.

189
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:41,943
You turnip-head! That's Howl's castle!

190
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:45,940
That is not what I meant when I asked for a place to stay.

191
00:18:56,575 --> 00:18:59,883
Look at that. They call this a castle?

192
00:19:10,114 --> 00:19:11,022
Ah!

193
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,756
Is that the way in?

194
00:19:24,412 --> 00:19:25,864
Slow down!

195
00:19:28,386 --> 00:19:30,399
For heaven's sake.

196
00:19:31,376 --> 00:19:34,483
Make up your mind. Are you gonna let me in or not?

197
00:19:34,568 --> 00:19:35,817
<i>Whoa!</i>

198
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:40,370
Oh, my shawl!

199
00:19:52,661 --> 00:19:55,704
It's nice and warm in there, so I'm going in.

200
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,178
Oh, my shawl, thank you.

201
00:19:58,203 --> 00:20:02,449
I'm sure Howl won't eat the heart
of a shriveled, old lady like me.

202
00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:06,870
It's been a pleasure of meeting you.

203
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:09,758
Even if you are my least favorite vegetable.

204
00:20:09,898 --> 00:20:12,093
Take care, Turnip-head.

205
00:20:41,801 --> 00:20:43,238
Ah.

206
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,055
Here we go.

207
00:20:59,073 --> 00:21:00,280
What a dump.

208
00:21:00,716 --> 00:21:03,871
When I think castle, this is not what I picture.

209
00:21:12,211 --> 00:21:16,840
Well, one nice thing about
getting old is nothing frightens you.

210
00:21:26,301 --> 00:21:29,228
I don't envy you, lady. That is one bad curse.

211
00:21:29,436 --> 00:21:32,973
Curses are tough. You're gonna have
a hard time getting rid of that one.

212
00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:35,411
The fire spoke!

213
00:21:35,484 --> 00:21:38,121
Let me guess,the curse won't
allow you to talk about it, right?

214
00:21:38,574 --> 00:21:39,941
Are you Howl?

215
00:21:40,072 --> 00:21:43,476
No, I'm an extremely powerful fire demon named Calcifer.

216
00:21:43,657 --> 00:21:45,344
I just like to do that once in a while.

217
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:49,665
A fire demon. Well, then, you
should be able to break my curse.

218
00:21:50,025 --> 00:21:51,122
Maybe, maybe not.

219
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,877
Listen, if you can find a way
to break the spell that's on me,

220
00:21:53,961 --> 00:21:56,620
then I'll break the spell that's on you, you got it?

221
00:21:57,089 --> 00:22:00,019
If you're a demon, how do I know I can trust you?

222
00:22:00,175 --> 00:22:02,386
You promise to help me if I help you?

223
00:22:02,469 --> 00:22:05,430
I don't know, lady. Demons don't make promises.

224
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,657
Then go find someone else.

225
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:10,744
Come on! You should feel sorry for me!

226
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:14,694
That spell keeps me stuck in this castle,
and Howl treats me like I'm his slave.

227
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:17,641
It burns me up. "You got to keep
the water hot, the rooms warm,"

228
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:18,771
"Keep the castle moving."

229
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:19,221
Oh, that's rough.

230
00:22:19,246 --> 00:22:21,488
Come on! You ever try to move a castle?

231
00:22:21,655 --> 00:22:24,825
If you can figure out how to
break this thing I'm in with Howl,

232
00:22:24,896 --> 00:22:26,453
then you can break my spell.

233
00:22:26,493 --> 00:22:29,146
After that, I can easily break the spell that's on you.

234
00:22:29,872 --> 00:22:32,999
All right, it's a deal.

235
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:37,530
Hey, lady? Lady?

236
00:22:38,672 --> 00:22:43,033
Hello? Lady? Hello? Hey, hey! Lady? Lady?

237
00:22:43,452 --> 00:22:48,213
Hey, let me get over there. Some big help you're gonna be.

238
00:23:42,486 --> 00:23:44,329
Hey, who's this lady?

239
00:23:44,446 --> 00:23:45,688
Porthaven door.

240
00:23:45,753 --> 00:23:47,308
How'd she get in here?

241
00:23:54,957 --> 00:23:56,152
Stand by.

242
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,889
Mr. Mayor, good day.

243
00:24:02,923 --> 00:24:04,174
Good afternoon, sir.

244
00:24:04,232 --> 00:24:06,885
Would the great Wizard Jenkins be at home?

245
00:24:07,261 --> 00:24:09,471
I am afraid that my master is out at the moment.

246
00:24:09,499 --> 00:24:11,547
I speak for him in his absence.

247
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:17,079
An invitation from His Majesty the
King. The time for war is upon us.

248
00:24:17,104 --> 00:24:21,384
His Majesty requires that every
witch and wizard aid our homeland.

249
00:24:21,576 --> 00:24:24,837
Wizard Jenkins must report to the palace immediately.

250
00:24:24,862 --> 00:24:25,699
That is all.

251
00:24:25,724 --> 00:24:26,929
War...

252
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,044
I can't believe it's come to this.

253
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:33,388
And what do you think you're doing here, Grandma?

254
00:24:33,537 --> 00:24:35,477
Calcifer said that I could come in.

255
00:24:35,502 --> 00:24:39,076
I did not. She just wandered in here from the Wastes.

256
00:24:39,293 --> 00:24:41,078
She's from the Wastes?

257
00:24:42,067 --> 00:24:44,011
How do we know that she's not a witch?

258
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,133
Do you think I'd let a witch in here?

259
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,063
Porthaven door again!

260
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:51,050
Must be a customer.

261
00:24:53,734 --> 00:24:55,109
Stand by.

262
00:24:57,811 --> 00:24:59,121
Yes, my dear child?

263
00:24:59,146 --> 00:25:01,474
My mom sent me to pick up a spell.

264
00:25:01,732 --> 00:25:03,579
Ah, yes, do come in.

265
00:25:03,604 --> 00:25:04,383
Okay.

266
00:25:05,485 --> 00:25:08,068
Just keep quiet and don't cause any trouble, Grandma.

267
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,097
It's not the Wastes.

268
00:25:26,173 --> 00:25:28,932
Excuse me, Granny, are you a witch, too?

269
00:25:29,843 --> 00:25:33,697
That's right. I'm the scariest witch of them all.

270
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:37,050
Dust your ship with this powder
and the winds will favor it.

271
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:37,988
Thanks.

272
00:25:40,771 --> 00:25:42,391
Farewell, child.

273
00:25:44,346 --> 00:25:46,314
Quit telling lies to our customers.

274
00:25:46,401 --> 00:25:48,837
What about you? You're wearing a disguise.

275
00:25:48,862 --> 00:25:50,970
I have to. I'm practicing my magic.

276
00:25:52,504 --> 00:25:52,991
Hmm?

277
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:55,341
It's the Kingsbury door!

278
00:25:56,703 --> 00:25:57,788
Stand by.

279
00:26:03,001 --> 00:26:06,129
Good day. Would this be the
residence of the great Wizard Pendragon?

280
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:07,255
It Is.

281
00:26:07,339 --> 00:26:09,895
I bear an invitation from His Majesty the King.

282
00:26:10,127 --> 00:26:12,945
Please inform Mr. Pendragon that all witches and wizards

283
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:15,456
are required to report for duty at the palace.

284
00:26:15,722 --> 00:26:17,666
I will inform him right away.

285
00:26:32,476 --> 00:26:35,295
This is the royal city, isn't it?

286
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,346
Move in, Grandma, or you'll lose your nose.

287
00:26:43,233 --> 00:26:45,099
And stop wandering around!

288
00:27:21,788 --> 00:27:24,504
Leave it alone, Grandma. I'm getting angry.

289
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:27,660
This is a magic house, isn't it?

290
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:28,360
Oh!

291
00:27:28,503 --> 00:27:30,981
So, tell me, where does the black one lead?

292
00:27:31,006 --> 00:27:32,697
Only Master Howl knows that.

293
00:27:32,966 --> 00:27:35,732
I need some breakfast. I'm starved.

294
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,808
Don't you want to have some bacon and eggs?

295
00:27:47,981 --> 00:27:51,693
Yeah, but we can't use the fire. Master Howl's not here.

296
00:27:54,738 --> 00:27:56,770
Don't worry, I can cook.

297
00:27:57,032 --> 00:28:01,244
It doesn't matter if you can cook,
Calcifer only obeys Master Howl.

298
00:28:01,328 --> 00:28:03,951
That's right, lady. I'm not taking any orders from you.

299
00:28:04,998 --> 00:28:06,733
Oh, there's my hat.

300
00:28:08,766 --> 00:28:10,054
That's better.

301
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:13,648
All right, Calcifer. Let's get cooking.

302
00:28:13,673 --> 00:28:17,211
I don't cook! I'm a scary and powerful fire demon!

303
00:28:19,262 --> 00:28:22,091
How would you like a bucket of cold water in your face?

304
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,602
Or maybe I should tell Howl about our bargain?

305
00:28:25,685 --> 00:28:30,647
Oh! Stupid me! I never should have let her in here.

306
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,563
So, what'll it be?

307
00:28:36,075 --> 00:28:39,410
That's right. That's a good fire.

308
00:28:41,034 --> 00:28:44,287
Here's another curse. May all your bacon burn.

309
00:28:44,581 --> 00:28:46,915
Calcifer's doing what she says.

310
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,696
I think I'd like some tea, too. Do you have a kettle?

311
00:28:49,721 --> 00:28:50,435
Sure.

312
00:28:50,578 --> 00:28:52,334
Hey, what are you doing?

313
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:54,798
Don't get the kettle! Who's side are you on, anyway?

314
00:28:54,828 --> 00:28:56,479
Michael, what are you doing?

315
00:28:56,504 --> 00:28:57,052
Huh?

316
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,655
Master Howl, the king's messengers were here.

317
00:29:02,681 --> 00:29:04,632
They said you have to report to the palace

318
00:29:04,724 --> 00:29:07,063
as both Pendragon and Jenkins.

319
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:20,952
Calcifer? You're being so obedient.

320
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:23,215
Not on purpose. She bullied me.

321
00:29:23,326 --> 00:29:25,757
Not just anybody can do that.

322
00:29:26,496 --> 00:29:28,206
And you are who?

323
00:29:28,874 --> 00:29:31,601
Uh, you can just call me Grandma Sophie.

324
00:29:31,626 --> 00:29:34,544
I'm your new cleaning lady. I just started work today.

325
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,847
Give that to me.

326
00:29:36,256 --> 00:29:37,269
Oh!

327
00:29:39,718 --> 00:29:43,578
Hand me two more slices of that
bacon and six more of those eggs.

328
00:29:56,568 --> 00:30:00,136
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

329
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:03,147
Mmm.

330
00:30:03,647 --> 00:30:04,434
Yummy.

331
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:15,962
So, then, who hired you to clean?

332
00:30:16,129 --> 00:30:20,884
Uh, Calcifer did. He's disgusted
by how dirty it is in here.

333
00:30:21,426 --> 00:30:22,207
Hmm.

334
00:30:22,552 --> 00:30:24,256
Michael, get the plates.

335
00:30:27,432 --> 00:30:30,343
Wait a second, you're all gonna
eat while I do all the work?

336
00:30:30,866 --> 00:30:32,591
Come have some breakfast, Sophie.

337
00:30:37,984 --> 00:30:39,458
Take a seat.

338
00:30:40,561 --> 00:30:40,996
Hmm.

339
00:30:54,465 --> 00:30:55,465
Which do you want?

340
00:30:55,786 --> 00:30:57,896
You only get one 'cause the rest are dirty.

341
00:31:00,674 --> 00:31:03,179
Looks like I've got my work cut out for me.

342
00:31:05,126 --> 00:31:06,223
Bread, Michael?

343
00:31:06,389 --> 00:31:07,286
Thanks.

344
00:31:08,848 --> 00:31:09,669
Sophie?

345
00:31:09,765 --> 00:31:11,631
Yes, thank you.

346
00:31:12,852 --> 00:31:15,636
So, friends, enjoy. Bon appétit.

347
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:16,692
Bon appétit.

348
00:31:16,856 --> 00:31:19,720
I can't remember the last time we had a real breakfast.

349
00:31:25,966 --> 00:31:28,634
Even the manners are a mess in this house.

350
00:31:29,703 --> 00:31:32,828
So, what do you have hidden in your pocket, Sophie?

351
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:35,251
Huh? Oh...

352
00:31:44,381 --> 00:31:45,667
What is this?

353
00:31:45,692 --> 00:31:46,532
Give it to me.

354
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,344
Hmm.

355
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,901
Oh!

356
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:56,479
Scorch marks. Howl, can you read them?

357
00:31:56,563 --> 00:31:59,984
That is an ancient sorcery. And quite powerful, too.

358
00:32:00,317 --> 00:32:02,160
it's from the Witch of the Waste?

359
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,877
"You who swallowed a falling star,

360
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,777
"Or heartless man, your heart shall soon belong to me."

361
00:32:08,906 --> 00:32:10,464
That can't be good for the table.

362
00:32:24,352 --> 00:32:26,034
Wow! It's gone!

363
00:32:26,213 --> 00:32:28,998
The mark may be gone, but the spell is still there.

364
00:32:29,205 --> 00:32:32,018
Excuse me, my friends, please continue your meal.

365
00:32:33,114 --> 00:32:36,459
Calcifer, move the castle 60 miles to the west.

366
00:32:41,455 --> 00:32:44,328
And while you're at it, make hot water for my bath.

367
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,040
Fine. Like moving the castle isn't hard enough?

368
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,187
You're not working for the Witch of the Waste, are you?

369
00:32:51,326 --> 00:32:55,812
I would never work for that witch! She's the one who...

370
00:32:59,078 --> 00:33:02,310
I'm actually a...

371
00:33:06,795 --> 00:33:10,303
If I ever get my hands on that
witch, I'm going to wring her fat neck!

372
00:33:10,393 --> 00:33:12,419
Finish your breakfast!

373
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:17,337
I've had enough of this!

374
00:33:19,356 --> 00:33:21,794
You bugs better run before I bite your heads off!

375
00:33:22,421 --> 00:33:26,370
I'm sick of being treated like some timid little old lady.

376
00:33:30,852 --> 00:33:33,410
Hello, sir, is my potion ready?

377
00:33:33,474 --> 00:33:36,858
Come back later. There's a witch on a rampage in there.

378
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,430
Sophie, please!

379
00:33:46,471 --> 00:33:48,871
Sophie! Please help me. I'm going out!

380
00:33:50,427 --> 00:33:53,462
Please, get me some firewood, quick!

381
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,736
Hey, please help me. Wait, what are you doing?

382
00:33:56,761 --> 00:33:59,744
Don't! I'll fall! You crazy lady with tongs!

383
00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:00,717
You'll be fine.

384
00:34:00,742 --> 00:34:01,329
I'll fall! Help!

385
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,831
I'm just sweeping out the ashes.

386
00:34:02,856 --> 00:34:07,291
No, I'm not fine! Please! I'm going out!

387
00:34:11,074 --> 00:34:12,657
Please. I'm falling.

388
00:34:14,006 --> 00:34:16,285
Help, I'm falling!

389
00:34:19,884 --> 00:34:24,515
Sophie, hurry up, please. Hurry, please.

390
00:34:26,796 --> 00:34:28,042
<i>Whoa!</i>

391
00:34:46,693 --> 00:34:50,211
I'd appreciate it if you didn't torment my friend.

392
00:34:54,931 --> 00:34:57,211
Master Howl, are you going out now?

393
00:34:59,929 --> 00:35:04,275
Michael, make sure the cleaning lady
doesn't get carried away while I'm gone.

394
00:35:09,047 --> 00:35:11,216
Sophie, what did you do now?

395
00:35:11,472 --> 00:35:13,466
She almost smothered me!

396
00:35:13,843 --> 00:35:16,930
If I die, Howl dies, too, I hope you know.

397
00:35:17,055 --> 00:35:19,390
Oh, be quiet. You're all right.

398
00:35:19,513 --> 00:35:22,000
Now quit bothering me, I've got a job to do.

399
00:35:23,978 --> 00:35:25,448
Wait, you can't come up here!

400
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,515
Whatever you don't want me to clean, better hide it now.

401
00:35:29,444 --> 00:35:31,215
Save my room for last, okay?

402
00:35:35,073 --> 00:35:37,859
These little outbursts seem to be giving me some energy.

403
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,087
What a mess.

404
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,208
Oh!

405
00:36:00,974 --> 00:36:02,027
Oh!

406
00:36:20,072 --> 00:36:24,556
Incredible! Calcifer! Calcifer!

407
00:36:24,581 --> 00:36:26,973
Are you the one moving the castle?

408
00:36:27,005 --> 00:36:29,085
Of course I am. No one else does any work around here.

409
00:36:29,168 --> 00:36:31,032
I am thoroughly impressed!

410
00:36:31,057 --> 00:36:34,402
You are a first-class fire demon. I like your spark.

411
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:41,028
She likes my spark! Ha-ha!

412
00:36:46,936 --> 00:36:48,680
Ah! Not ready! Not ready!

413
00:37:21,522 --> 00:37:22,864
It's beautiful.

414
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:24,756
Yeah. It's called Star Lake.

415
00:37:29,979 --> 00:37:31,873
Hey, what's that stick doing in there?

416
00:37:31,898 --> 00:37:35,371
Oh, dear. Give me a hand, Michael.

417
00:37:42,617 --> 00:37:44,411
It's a scarecrow.

418
00:37:44,577 --> 00:37:46,788
Yep, I've been calling him Turnip-head.

419
00:37:46,871 --> 00:37:50,004
Somehow he always manages to get stuck upside down.

420
00:37:58,508 --> 00:38:02,845
He keeps following me everywhere.
Seems to have taken a liking to me.

421
00:38:02,994 --> 00:38:05,515
That's weird. Are you sure you're not a witch, Sophie?

422
00:38:05,598 --> 00:38:09,343
Oh, yes! I'm the worst kind of
witch ever, the kind that cleans.

423
00:38:38,204 --> 00:38:41,410
Quit pulling so hard, Turnip-head!

424
00:38:50,852 --> 00:38:52,678
I think he likes doing the laundry.

425
00:38:52,908 --> 00:38:55,585
Looks like he'll have it dry in no time.

426
00:38:57,896 --> 00:39:02,089
I bet he's some kind of demon.
Calcifer doesn't seem to mind him at all.

427
00:39:02,196 --> 00:39:04,841
You're right. He probably is a demon.

428
00:39:06,367 --> 00:39:09,465
But he led me here, So maybe he's the good kind.

429
00:39:52,047 --> 00:39:54,175
We got all the laundry put away, Sophie.

430
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,752
Oh, thank you, Michael.

431
00:39:55,819 --> 00:39:59,272
When you're old, all you want
to do is stare at the scenery.

432
00:40:00,463 --> 00:40:04,300
It's so strange, I've never felt so peaceful before.

433
00:41:22,805 --> 00:41:23,892
Whew.

434
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,798
You okay? I mean, you smell terrible.

435
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:46,424
You shouldn't keep flying around like that.

436
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:49,562
Soon you won't be able to turn back into a human.

437
00:41:54,201 --> 00:41:57,141
Isn't this great? Sophie put these here for me.

438
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,557
This war is terrible.

439
00:42:01,626 --> 00:42:04,427
They've bombed from the southern
coast to the northern border.

440
00:42:04,462 --> 00:42:05,858
It's all in flames now.

441
00:42:05,922 --> 00:42:08,423
I can't stand the fire in gunpowder.

442
00:42:08,633 --> 00:42:11,385
Those dopey guys have absolutely no manners.

443
00:42:12,143 --> 00:42:14,097
My own kind attacked me today.

444
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,432
Who, the Witch of the Waste?

445
00:42:15,457 --> 00:42:19,181
No, some hack wizards who turned
themselves into monsters for the king.

446
00:42:19,689 --> 00:42:22,350
Those wizards are going to regret doing that.

447
00:42:22,521 --> 00:42:24,941
They'll never change back into humans.

448
00:42:25,149 --> 00:42:28,152
After the war, they won't recall they ever were human.

449
00:42:28,235 --> 00:42:31,006
Hey, aren't you supposed to report to the king, too?

450
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:34,461
I'm tired. Make some hot water for my bath.

451
00:42:34,634 --> 00:42:36,718
What? Not again.

452
00:43:09,443 --> 00:43:10,437
Is Howl back?

453
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:12,606
Yes. He's wasting all my hot water again.

454
00:43:18,042 --> 00:43:19,694
I don't know why we're doing this.

455
00:43:19,745 --> 00:43:21,625
Master Howl hardly eats anything.

456
00:43:21,747 --> 00:43:22,506
Too bad.

457
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:23,699
Good morning.

458
00:43:23,724 --> 00:43:24,539
Good morning.

459
00:43:27,253 --> 00:43:31,257
Don't you love early morning
markets? And just look at the water!

460
00:43:31,382 --> 00:43:34,559
I've never seen the ocean before! It's beautiful!

461
00:43:34,802 --> 00:43:36,275
It always looks like that.

462
00:43:45,419 --> 00:43:47,375
Hmm. I hate potatoes.

463
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,160
Pay up.

464
00:43:48,441 --> 00:43:49,972
Thanks, have a nice day.

465
00:43:50,305 --> 00:43:51,545
Thank you. Come again.

466
00:43:53,112 --> 00:43:55,494
All our fish were caught fresh this morning.

467
00:43:57,448 --> 00:43:59,355
Hmm, I hate fish.

468
00:43:59,577 --> 00:44:01,495
One of our ships is in the harbor!

469
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:02,830
It looks like it's on fire!

470
00:44:02,913 --> 00:44:04,924
Looks like there's been a serious battle.

471
00:44:05,163 --> 00:44:07,562
What happened? Sorry, lady, we're closed.

472
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,468
The ship, it's sinking!

473
00:44:32,303 --> 00:44:34,250
Come on, Sophie, let's get a better look.

474
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,236
No, I've seen all I can take. Let's go home.

475
00:44:38,157 --> 00:44:40,803
I can't believe this. That's
almost the advanced battleship.

476
00:44:45,309 --> 00:44:47,255
The witch's henchmen are here.

477
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:47,796
What?

478
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:48,891
Quiet down.

479
00:44:49,393 --> 00:44:51,727
They're only a few feet away.

480
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:58,425
He's gone.

481
00:44:58,564 --> 00:45:01,309
I don't understand why no one else seemed to notice him.

482
00:45:07,061 --> 00:45:08,854
Look! There they are!

483
00:45:09,105 --> 00:45:10,898
That plane! That's what dropped the bombs!

484
00:45:10,925 --> 00:45:13,011
Look, Sophie. It's the enemy's airship!

485
00:45:18,697 --> 00:45:20,719
Sophie! Wait up! Sophie!

486
00:45:21,102 --> 00:45:23,744
Ignore the flyers. They're enemy propaganda.

487
00:45:28,649 --> 00:45:30,292
Sophie, are you okay?

488
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:38,411
I just need a glass of water.

489
00:45:38,558 --> 00:45:39,588
I'll get it.

490
00:45:55,345 --> 00:46:00,464
Sophie! You sabotaged me! Look!
Look what you've done to my hair!

491
00:46:00,489 --> 00:46:02,007
Look!

492
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:03,470
What a pretty color.

493
00:46:03,764 --> 00:46:05,130
It's hideous!

494
00:46:05,204 --> 00:46:08,490
You completely ruined my magic potions in the bathroom.

495
00:46:09,397 --> 00:46:12,066
I just organized things, Howl, nothing's ruined.

496
00:46:12,126 --> 00:46:13,639
Wrong! Wrong!

497
00:46:14,022 --> 00:46:17,262
I specifically ordered you not to get carried away!

498
00:46:18,048 --> 00:46:22,332
Now I'm repulsive. I can't live like this.

499
00:46:24,221 --> 00:46:26,225
Come on, it's not that bad.

500
00:46:34,092 --> 00:46:37,171
You should look at it now. This shade is even better.

501
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:38,435
I give up.

502
00:46:38,949 --> 00:46:42,303
I see no point in living if I can't be beautiful.

503
00:46:53,626 --> 00:46:56,343
Howl, cut it out. Howl, no, stop it.

504
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:58,547
He's calling the Spirits of Darkness.

505
00:46:58,631 --> 00:47:01,785
I saw him do this once before when a girl dumped him.

506
00:47:05,006 --> 00:47:09,714
Now, Howl, you're all right.
We'll just dye your hair back again.

507
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:12,249
Okay? Oh!

508
00:47:21,537 --> 00:47:23,747
Fine! So, you think you've got it bad?

509
00:47:23,817 --> 00:47:26,979
I've never once been beautiful in my entire life!

510
00:47:28,489 --> 00:47:31,236
I've had enough of this place!

511
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,747
Thank you, Turnip-head. How did you get to be so kind?

512
00:48:13,783 --> 00:48:17,101
Sophie, get back inside, we
need your help! Howl's in trouble!

513
00:48:17,224 --> 00:48:19,492
Howl, cut it out, cut it out! I'm gonna drown!

514
00:48:19,517 --> 00:48:22,923
I'm drowning here, Howl. Sophie! Sophie, help him, please!

515
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,816
Sophie! Do something!

516
00:48:27,344 --> 00:48:28,582
Such drama.

517
00:48:28,987 --> 00:48:30,090
Is he dead?

518
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:32,850
No, he's fine. He's just throwing a tantrum.

519
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:34,445
Come on. Give me a hand.

520
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:35,949
Okay.

521
00:48:39,273 --> 00:48:41,254
Get the hot water running.

522
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:41,904
Right.

523
00:48:42,151 --> 00:48:44,574
Come on, Howl, you can still walk.

524
00:48:56,248 --> 00:48:57,929
Get him cleaned up, Michael.

525
00:48:57,954 --> 00:48:58,762
I will.

526
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,648
Now I have to mop again.

527
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:14,383
This says they've landed on the coast already.

528
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,305
Where?

529
00:49:15,362 --> 00:49:15,972
North.

530
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:28,287
Howl, I'm coming in.

531
00:49:35,871 --> 00:49:38,329
I brought you some warm milk. Want a sip?

532
00:49:41,556 --> 00:49:45,646
I'll leave it here for you, then.
Try to drink it before it gets cold.

533
00:49:49,218 --> 00:49:51,050
Sophie, wait.

534
00:49:59,103 --> 00:50:00,560
Do you want some milk?

535
00:50:11,407 --> 00:50:13,987
The Witch of the Waste is trying to find my castle.

536
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,025
I saw her henchmen at the harbor.

537
00:50:19,311 --> 00:50:21,725
I am such a big coward, all I do is hide.

538
00:50:21,995 --> 00:50:25,435
And all of this magic is just to keep everybody away.

539
00:50:25,754 --> 00:50:27,739
I can't stand how scared I am.

540
00:50:29,304 --> 00:50:33,000
Howl, why is the Witch of the
Waste trying to hunt you down?

541
00:50:33,345 --> 00:50:36,980
She was once quite beautiful, so I decided to pursue her.

542
00:50:37,178 --> 00:50:41,349
Then I realized she wasn't. So, as usual, I ran away.

543
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:47,110
I can't run much longer, though.
I have to report to the palace,

544
00:50:47,166 --> 00:50:49,858
as both Pendragon and Jenkins.

545
00:50:49,898 --> 00:50:52,274
How many aliases do you have, anyway?

546
00:50:52,448 --> 00:50:54,546
As many as I need to keep my freedom.

547
00:50:54,824 --> 00:50:55,683
Hmm.

548
00:50:56,287 --> 00:50:58,495
Just refuse the king's invitation.

549
00:50:58,614 --> 00:50:59,543
See that?

550
00:51:00,147 --> 00:51:03,358
That's the oath I took when I
entered the Royal Sorcery Academy.

551
00:51:03,444 --> 00:51:06,011
I must report to the palace whenever summoned.

552
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,840
You know, Howl, I think that you should see the king.

553
00:51:09,965 --> 00:51:10,826
What?

554
00:51:11,967 --> 00:51:15,512
Give him a piece of your mind.
Tell him this war is pointless.

555
00:51:15,596 --> 00:51:17,617
And you refuse to take part, huh?

556
00:51:19,623 --> 00:51:22,400
You obviously don't know what these people are like.

557
00:51:22,904 --> 00:51:24,406
But he's our king.

558
00:51:24,563 --> 00:51:27,849
He should want to hear what all his citizens have to say.

559
00:51:28,931 --> 00:51:32,498
I got it! Why don't you go to the palace for me?

560
00:51:32,654 --> 00:51:33,466
Huh?

561
00:51:34,084 --> 00:51:36,461
Just say that you're Pendragon's mother,

562
00:51:36,658 --> 00:51:40,482
and your son is such a cowardly
wizard, he's too afraid to show his face.

563
00:51:40,522 --> 00:51:43,332
Maybe then Madame Suliman will finally give up on me.

564
00:51:43,641 --> 00:51:45,281
Who's Madame Suliman?

565
00:51:49,111 --> 00:51:50,510
You're wearing that hat?

566
00:51:50,589 --> 00:51:53,036
After all the magic I used to make your dress pretty?

567
00:51:53,061 --> 00:51:54,466
Take care of him, Michael.

568
00:51:54,491 --> 00:51:55,189
Mmm-hmm.

569
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:57,492
Good luck.

570
00:52:05,646 --> 00:52:08,609
This charm will guarantee your safe return.

571
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,629
Don't worry. I'll follow behind you in disguise.

572
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:15,266
Now. Off you go.

573
00:52:22,829 --> 00:52:25,992
Why do I feel like this is not going to work?

574
00:52:34,448 --> 00:52:36,677
I wonder what Howl disguised himself as.

575
00:52:36,702 --> 00:52:38,220
Surely not a crow.

576
00:52:44,926 --> 00:52:47,522
Can't be a pigeon, he's too flamboyant for that.

577
00:52:53,663 --> 00:52:54,998
That could be him.

578
00:53:06,331 --> 00:53:09,037
Look how far I still have to go.

579
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:20,868
Come on! Step right up!

580
00:53:51,126 --> 00:53:54,296
Howl? You disguised yourself as an old dog?

581
00:53:59,855 --> 00:54:02,673
You couldn't think of something a bit more useful?

582
00:54:03,116 --> 00:54:05,614
Do you know how hard it is to do things when you're old?

583
00:54:08,602 --> 00:54:11,986
Look who's here. The tacky little girl from that hat shop.

584
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,438
Witch of the Waste.

585
00:54:13,767 --> 00:54:16,937
Thank you for handing my scorching love note to Howl.

586
00:54:19,231 --> 00:54:21,129
How's he doing, by the way?

587
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:23,267
He's acting like a big baby.

588
00:54:23,309 --> 00:54:26,729
And he's working me to the bone as his cleaning lady.

589
00:54:27,204 --> 00:54:28,756
How delightful.

590
00:54:30,374 --> 00:54:34,191
So, tell me, what business do you have here at the palace?

591
00:54:34,363 --> 00:54:36,900
Job hunting. I'm sick of working for Howl.

592
00:54:37,249 --> 00:54:38,834
And what about yourself?

593
00:54:39,051 --> 00:54:41,318
I received a royal invitation.

594
00:54:42,113 --> 00:54:46,720
That idiot Suliman finally
realized how much she needs my powers.

595
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:50,485
If you're so great, why don't
you break this spell you put on me?

596
00:54:50,695 --> 00:54:52,145
I'm sorry, dear.

597
00:54:52,254 --> 00:54:56,324
My talent lies in casting spells, not breaking them.

598
00:54:56,596 --> 00:54:58,191
Bye, Granny.

599
00:54:59,392 --> 00:55:02,832
Now, just wait a minute! You get back here right now!

600
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:07,018
If I didn't have you to worry
about, I would have clobbered her.

601
00:55:24,622 --> 00:55:26,286
What on earth is wrong with you two?

602
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:27,405
Sorry, ma'am.

603
00:55:27,492 --> 00:55:29,825
Vehicles are prohibited beyond this point.

604
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:31,601
You must continue on foot.

605
00:55:31,768 --> 00:55:32,966
That Suliman.

606
00:55:33,058 --> 00:55:37,351
Using her magic to force me to
climb all those godforsaken stairs.

607
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:52,632
Come on, Howl. We can do this, just act natural.

608
00:56:02,883 --> 00:56:03,881
Oh!

609
00:56:16,521 --> 00:56:19,263
Howl, why are you so heavy?

610
00:56:28,884 --> 00:56:32,959
Wait. Help. I can't make it.

611
00:56:33,315 --> 00:56:34,723
What'd you say?

612
00:56:35,417 --> 00:56:39,307
You suddenly remembered how to
break the spell you put on me?

613
00:56:39,402 --> 00:56:43,001
I told you. I don't know how.

614
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,019
Then start studying.

615
00:56:51,133 --> 00:56:52,210
I don't get it.

616
00:56:53,099 --> 00:56:56,072
Where does she get all that energy?

617
00:57:03,436 --> 00:57:05,422
I have to rest a bit.

618
00:57:12,869 --> 00:57:16,951
Why don't you just give up? You're killing yourself.

619
00:57:16,991 --> 00:57:21,885
I've waited for 50 years now to be invited here.

620
00:57:22,403 --> 00:57:27,336
Ever since that Suliman banished me to live in the Wastes.

621
00:57:27,415 --> 00:57:28,750
Well, good luck, then.

622
00:57:28,885 --> 00:57:32,214
Too bad I'm not younger, or I'd lend you a hand.

623
00:57:32,922 --> 00:57:34,242
Come on, Howl.

624
00:57:35,684 --> 00:57:40,579
You cold-hearted old hag. Next
time, I'll turn you senile, too.

625
00:58:01,514 --> 00:58:03,651
Almost there!

626
00:58:04,129 --> 00:58:06,456
Honored guest, please follow me.

627
00:58:07,007 --> 00:58:09,507
You should go help her get up these stairs.

628
00:58:09,634 --> 00:58:12,771
I am strictly forbidden to offer such assistance.

629
00:58:13,013 --> 00:58:16,155
Why? That's so rude. The king himself invited her.

630
00:58:16,474 --> 00:58:19,389
Come on! Let's go!

631
00:58:19,859 --> 00:58:23,398
Don't give up now! Are you a witch or aren't you?

632
00:58:25,474 --> 00:58:26,911
Just shut up.

633
00:58:29,988 --> 00:58:32,601
What happened? You look so much older.

634
00:58:33,533 --> 00:58:36,686
Mrs. Pendragon and the Witch of the Waste!

635
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:41,429
Pull yourself together. Isn't
this what you've been waiting for?

636
00:58:45,086 --> 00:58:48,429
Mrs. Pendragon and the Witch of the Waste!

637
00:58:48,506 --> 00:58:52,481
Your name's Pendragon? Why
does that name sound so familiar?

638
00:58:52,671 --> 00:58:55,277
Uh, because that was the name of my tacky hat shop,

639
00:58:55,302 --> 00:58:56,366
don't you remember?

640
00:58:56,503 --> 00:58:57,931
Is that what it was?

641
00:58:58,016 --> 00:59:00,369
Wait in here, please.

642
00:59:06,961 --> 00:59:10,031
A chair! It's mine!

643
00:59:21,379 --> 00:59:23,609
Howl, get back here.

644
00:59:30,331 --> 00:59:31,212
Oh!

645
00:59:31,785 --> 00:59:33,174
This way please, ma'am.

646
00:59:41,368 --> 00:59:42,322
Huh?

647
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,515
Thank you, Madame Suliman.

648
01:00:14,394 --> 01:00:15,548
Madame Suliman.

649
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,918
So, you are Howl's mother, are you?

650
01:00:36,511 --> 01:00:39,009
Yes, I'm Mrs. Pendragon.

651
01:00:39,249 --> 01:00:41,813
You must be tired. Please have a seat.

652
01:00:41,899 --> 01:00:43,005
Thank you.

653
01:00:53,206 --> 01:00:56,916
I am Madame Suliman, His Majesty's head sorceress.

654
01:00:57,552 --> 01:00:58,323
Hmm.

655
01:01:02,923 --> 01:01:04,488
That's not your dog, is it?

656
01:01:04,809 --> 01:01:10,478
His name is Heen. He's my errand
dog. I had him escort you here.

657
01:01:12,197 --> 01:01:13,240
Oh.

658
01:01:14,486 --> 01:01:16,842
I take it Howl won't be joining us?

659
01:01:18,156 --> 01:01:21,076
He's such a lazy son, he sent me instead.

660
01:01:21,148 --> 01:01:24,412
I'm afraid the king would find him completely useless.

661
01:01:25,505 --> 01:01:27,702
I am very sorry to hear that.

662
01:01:28,102 --> 01:01:31,198
Howl was the last apprentice I ever took on.

663
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:35,013
I'd never seen such a gifted student.

664
01:01:35,673 --> 01:01:40,565
I was so thrilled to have finally found
someone talented enough to replace me.

665
01:01:41,846 --> 01:01:44,697
Then, one day, his heart was stolen by a demon.

666
01:01:44,832 --> 01:01:47,044
He never returned to complete his apprenticeship.

667
01:01:47,143 --> 01:01:51,870
And from that day forward, he has been
using his magic for entirely selfish reasons.

668
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:54,993
Mrs. Pendragon.

669
01:01:55,018 --> 01:01:55,477
Yes?

670
01:01:55,652 --> 01:01:57,688
That boy is extremely dangerous.

671
01:01:57,743 --> 01:02:00,706
His powers are far too great for someone without a heart.

672
01:02:03,009 --> 01:02:04,463
If he stays selfish,

673
01:02:04,494 --> 01:02:07,372
I'm afraid he'll end up just like the Witch of the Waste.

674
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:08,570
Send her in.

675
01:02:14,791 --> 01:02:16,602
What on earth happened to you?

676
01:02:18,383 --> 01:02:21,370
I just restored her to the age she actually is.

677
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:23,484
All her powers are gone now.

678
01:02:23,763 --> 01:02:28,036
Once, she, too, was a magnificent
sorcerer with so much promise.

679
01:02:28,354 --> 01:02:34,091
But then she fell prey to a demon of
greed, who slowly consumed her, body and soul.

680
01:02:34,416 --> 01:02:40,215
Our kingdom can no longer afford to turn a
blind eye to these disreputable witches and wizards.

681
01:02:40,301 --> 01:02:44,409
If Howl reports to me and vows to
use his magic to serve the kingdom,

682
01:02:44,442 --> 01:02:46,929
I will show him how to break from his demon.

683
01:02:47,537 --> 01:02:51,267
If not, I'll strip him of all his powers. Just like her.

684
01:02:52,441 --> 01:02:54,007
That is enough!

685
01:02:54,919 --> 01:02:58,840
Now I understand why Howl was so
concerned about coming to see you.

686
01:02:58,954 --> 01:02:59,950
It's a trap.

687
01:03:00,194 --> 01:03:03,280
You lure people here with an invitation from the king,

688
01:03:03,407 --> 01:03:06,084
and then you strip them of all their powers.

689
01:03:06,306 --> 01:03:08,433
Howl would never be so heartless.

690
01:03:08,558 --> 01:03:10,518
He may be selfish and cowardly,

691
01:03:10,602 --> 01:03:12,766
and sometimes he's hard to understand,

692
01:03:12,812 --> 01:03:16,270
but his intentions are good. He just wants to be free.

693
01:03:16,393 --> 01:03:19,106
Howl won't come here. He doesn't need your help.

694
01:03:19,353 --> 01:03:22,054
He can fix his problem with his demon on his own.

695
01:03:22,113 --> 01:03:23,643
I am certain of it.

696
01:03:24,774 --> 01:03:27,611
Now I understand. You're in love with Howl.

697
01:03:28,386 --> 01:03:31,229
Howl? Did you say Howl's coming?

698
01:03:31,392 --> 01:03:34,282
I want his heart, his heart belongs to me!

699
01:03:34,758 --> 01:03:36,752
Stop that, just calm down.

700
01:03:36,794 --> 01:03:39,080
Howl is not coming here, okay?

701
01:03:39,881 --> 01:03:41,677
Oh, I think he will.

702
01:03:42,258 --> 01:03:45,507
I now know his weakness, Mrs. Pendragon.

703
01:03:52,268 --> 01:03:53,461
Your Majesty.

704
01:03:53,486 --> 01:03:54,445
As you were.

705
01:03:55,023 --> 01:03:56,816
So, then, how are you feeling?

706
01:03:56,841 --> 01:03:58,188
I'm fine, thank you.

707
01:03:58,233 --> 01:03:59,483
Thought I'd drop by,

708
01:03:59,595 --> 01:04:01,842
rather than sit through a dull war meeting.

709
01:04:01,988 --> 01:04:03,574
What an honor.

710
01:04:03,679 --> 01:04:05,266
Who are your guests?

711
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:07,960
This is Howl's mother, Mrs. Pendragon.

712
01:04:08,034 --> 01:04:08,881
Ah.

713
01:04:13,365 --> 01:04:14,574
Thanks for coming.

714
01:04:14,666 --> 01:04:17,787
But I've decided not to use magic to win this war.

715
01:04:18,223 --> 01:04:23,062
We have tried using Madame Suliman's magic
to shield our palace from the enemy's bombs.

716
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:25,619
But the bombs fall on civilian homes instead.

717
01:04:25,716 --> 01:04:28,481
That's the problem with magic. Right, Suliman?

718
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:30,927
You're so eloquent today, Your Majesty.

719
01:04:30,983 --> 01:04:32,612
Suliman!

720
01:04:35,337 --> 01:04:36,922
I've got a new battle plan.

721
01:04:36,947 --> 01:04:39,055
This time we're going to beat them to a pulp.

722
01:04:39,628 --> 01:04:40,234
Um...

723
01:04:42,568 --> 01:04:44,946
Suliman, that's the best double you've made of me yet.

724
01:04:45,029 --> 01:04:46,781
Ha! Keep up the good work.

725
01:04:46,864 --> 01:04:48,035
Your Majesty.

726
01:04:48,565 --> 01:04:50,012
Get my generals assembled.

727
01:04:50,051 --> 01:04:50,570
Sir.

728
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,599
So nice to see you again, Howl.

729
01:04:57,332 --> 01:04:59,375
You're looking well, Madame Suliman.

730
01:04:59,436 --> 01:05:01,850
Rather weak disguise. Didn't I teach you better?

731
01:05:01,921 --> 01:05:03,756
I'm not trying to outwit you.

732
01:05:03,791 --> 01:05:06,282
I kept my oath, I reported when summoned.

733
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:08,412
Now Mother and I will go.

734
01:05:08,469 --> 01:05:10,040
I'm afraid not.

735
01:05:31,659 --> 01:05:33,987
Now whatever you do, don't look down.

736
01:05:34,306 --> 01:05:37,824
It's time to show your mother what you really are, Howl.

737
01:06:22,188 --> 01:06:22,981
Oh!

738
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:34,779
Stop, Howl, it's a trap!

739
01:06:47,198 --> 01:06:48,241
Hold on.

740
01:06:56,461 --> 01:06:58,399
Sophie, sit up here.

741
01:06:59,956 --> 01:07:02,348
Did you have to bring those two with you?

742
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:06,676
Nice doggie.

743
01:07:07,171 --> 01:07:10,094
Hmm. I can't believe you work for Suliman.

744
01:07:11,259 --> 01:07:13,122
I guess it's too late to toss him.

745
01:07:13,302 --> 01:07:14,599
Sophie. Take the wheel.

746
01:07:14,624 --> 01:07:15,370
What?

747
01:07:15,513 --> 01:07:17,142
I can't fly, are you kidding?

748
01:07:17,231 --> 01:07:18,810
They're gaining on us.

749
01:07:23,646 --> 01:07:27,275
I'll distract them, then you can fly
this thing back to my castle in the Wastes.

750
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:29,127
How? I don't know the way.

751
01:07:29,152 --> 01:07:32,029
Hey, don't worry. The ring that I
gave you will guide you back home.

752
01:07:32,113 --> 01:07:34,565
All you have to do is summon Calcifer with your heart.

753
01:07:34,802 --> 01:07:35,892
Calcifer?

754
01:07:39,728 --> 01:07:40,627
It's glowing.

755
01:07:42,081 --> 01:07:45,117
Just keep following that light
and you should be there before dark.

756
01:07:45,142 --> 01:07:48,630
I can't do this. Why did you make me
come here if you were coming yourself?

757
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:51,149
Knowing you'd be there gave me the courage to show up.

758
01:07:51,174 --> 01:07:54,063
That woman terrifies me, I can't face her on my own.

759
01:07:54,484 --> 01:07:58,487
You saved me, Sophie. I was in big trouble back there.

760
01:07:59,417 --> 01:08:01,380
Oh! Don't let go!

761
01:08:08,566 --> 01:08:09,841
Wow. You're good.

762
01:08:09,866 --> 01:08:11,001
Are you nuts?

763
01:08:12,737 --> 01:08:14,345
We've got a good lead now.

764
01:08:14,582 --> 01:08:17,848
I can give you five minutes of
invisibility, so use it wisely.

765
01:08:21,579 --> 01:08:22,871
Howl!

766
01:08:22,975 --> 01:08:24,643
Good luck!

767
01:08:25,249 --> 01:08:26,382
Oh!

768
01:08:34,842 --> 01:08:36,472
No, not now.

769
01:08:37,421 --> 01:08:40,907
Oh, thank you. That was the most fun I've had in ages.

770
01:08:40,932 --> 01:08:43,550
I suppose Howl thinks he's evaded me.

771
01:08:43,976 --> 01:08:47,269
Hmm. I bet his mother can help me find him.

772
01:09:04,647 --> 01:09:05,414
Go!

773
01:09:07,793 --> 01:09:08,642
Huh?

774
01:09:37,948 --> 01:09:41,032
Almost there. That's my hometown below us.

775
01:09:43,661 --> 01:09:47,355
Don't try to be cute, dog. I'm
still not going to trust you.

776
01:10:11,147 --> 01:10:13,337
The castle is coming to meet us!

777
01:10:17,945 --> 01:10:20,683
Sophie! Here!

778
01:10:20,708 --> 01:10:24,292
Michael, help me! How am I supposed to land this thing?

779
01:10:36,433 --> 01:10:37,569
Sophie!

780
01:10:38,904 --> 01:10:40,245
Nice doggie.

781
01:10:42,393 --> 01:10:43,596
Michael !

782
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:45,806
I'm home.

783
01:10:45,977 --> 01:10:47,309
Are you hurt?

784
01:10:47,711 --> 01:10:48,787
<i>Whoa!</i>

785
01:10:49,101 --> 01:10:50,154
I missed you.

786
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:51,185
I missed you, too.

787
01:10:51,228 --> 01:10:53,092
Thanks for coming to meet us.

788
01:11:23,268 --> 01:11:26,453
Oh, this is bad. You've gone too far, Howl.

789
01:11:45,023 --> 01:11:47,117
I wonder if Howl's back home.

790
01:12:41,877 --> 01:12:42,838
Howl?

791
01:13:45,204 --> 01:13:47,388
Howl, is that you?

792
01:13:50,199 --> 01:13:52,506
Are you in pain? Tell me what's happening.

793
01:13:53,369 --> 01:13:54,928
Go away.

794
01:13:55,412 --> 01:13:57,206
No, I'm not going away.

795
01:13:57,289 --> 01:13:59,981
I'm going to help you break the spell that you're under.

796
01:14:00,855 --> 01:14:04,239
You... You can't even break your own spell.

797
01:14:04,296 --> 01:14:06,831
But you don't understand. I love you.

798
01:14:06,856 --> 01:14:08,618
You're too late.

799
01:14:12,866 --> 01:14:14,551
Howl! No!

800
01:14:27,319 --> 01:14:29,171
Calcifer, did Howl just get in?

801
01:14:29,196 --> 01:14:30,736
Yeah, and he looks terrible.

802
01:14:31,031 --> 01:14:33,675
You better figure out how to break the spell on us quick.

803
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:36,512
Howl's running out of time, I hope you realize that.

804
01:14:36,537 --> 01:14:39,024
You mean he'll become a monster. Is that it?

805
01:14:39,072 --> 01:14:42,685
I can't tell you details of the
curse, lady. You should know that by now.

806
01:14:44,712 --> 01:14:46,681
Do you know what Madame Suliman said?

807
01:14:47,006 --> 01:14:50,051
She said that Howl's heart was stolen by a demon.

808
01:14:50,175 --> 01:14:51,944
Tell me now. What do you know?

809
01:14:51,969 --> 01:14:55,221
I'm so sorry, but that would be confidential information.

810
01:14:55,264 --> 01:14:57,740
What if I dump a bucket of water on you?

811
01:14:57,969 --> 01:15:00,712
If you drown me, then Howl will die, too!

812
01:15:20,331 --> 01:15:23,769
Hi, Turnip-head. This isn't gonna be easy.

813
01:15:27,321 --> 01:15:29,569
Okay. Ready!

814
01:15:29,673 --> 01:15:33,240
All right! Calcifer, open it wider.

815
01:15:33,748 --> 01:15:35,916
Here we go!

816
01:15:48,404 --> 01:15:51,177
I said move!

817
01:15:51,694 --> 01:15:52,401
Ow!

818
01:15:53,268 --> 01:15:54,738
Oh! Oh!

819
01:16:14,896 --> 01:16:18,708
If I just hang a little curtain
here, maybe Howl won't notice.

820
01:16:21,058 --> 01:16:23,656
Come on in, it's time to eat.

821
01:16:29,358 --> 01:16:31,364
Here. Want some more?

822
01:16:32,668 --> 01:16:35,138
Don't feed her! That's the Witch of the Waste!

823
01:16:35,406 --> 01:16:36,916
Oh, she's all right.

824
01:16:37,074 --> 01:16:39,531
She keeps staring at me. It's freaking me out.

825
01:16:39,769 --> 01:16:41,842
What a pretty fire.

826
01:16:44,707 --> 01:16:46,078
Howl! Hello.

827
01:16:46,103 --> 01:16:47,059
Good morning, everyone.

828
01:16:47,115 --> 01:16:48,241
Glad you're home.

829
01:16:48,269 --> 01:16:50,557
Master Howl, we can keep this dog, can't we?

830
01:16:50,730 --> 01:16:53,577
The Witch of the Waste and Suliman's dog at my table.

831
01:16:53,757 --> 01:16:56,477
What possessed you to let them in the house, Calcifer?

832
01:16:56,635 --> 01:16:58,011
I didn't let them in.

833
01:16:58,053 --> 01:17:00,949
Sophie crash-landed her plane into my face.

834
01:17:03,530 --> 01:17:05,436
I knew she'd make a great pilot.

835
01:17:06,068 --> 01:17:08,895
Looks like we have yet another addition to the family.

836
01:17:09,606 --> 01:17:12,939
Hmm, you've got quite a nasty spell on you, too.

837
01:17:13,655 --> 01:17:15,887
Seems everyone in this family's got problems.

838
01:17:15,946 --> 01:17:18,282
What a handsome man.

839
01:17:18,741 --> 01:17:22,044
So, we've got a lot of work to do. We're moving.

840
01:17:22,347 --> 01:17:23,213
Moving?

841
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:23,886
That's good.

842
01:17:23,911 --> 01:17:26,573
I'm sick of being stuck out here in the middle of nowhere.

843
01:17:26,748 --> 01:17:30,196
Madame Suliman is hot on our
trail, so we're gonna have to hurry.

844
01:17:30,424 --> 01:17:33,047
I'm afraid your spell is too strong for this move.

845
01:17:33,166 --> 01:17:34,756
You're gonna have to stay behind.

846
01:17:40,654 --> 01:17:42,527
There. All done.

847
01:17:43,009 --> 01:17:46,132
All right, Calcifer, line her up.

848
01:17:59,823 --> 01:18:02,905
There. That should do it. Sit tight for a second.

849
01:18:06,705 --> 01:18:08,864
Be gentle with me, please.

850
01:18:12,033 --> 01:18:13,535
On my mark.

851
01:18:57,936 --> 01:19:00,571
Moving's done. You can get down now.

852
01:19:02,928 --> 01:19:05,400
This is great, Master Howl! It's huge!

853
01:19:05,489 --> 01:19:08,586
Oh, what a pretty fire.

854
01:19:22,573 --> 01:19:23,793
But this is...

855
01:19:23,882 --> 01:19:25,359
I added on a bathroom,

856
01:19:25,450 --> 01:19:27,693
since our family seems to keep growing.

857
01:19:28,256 --> 01:19:29,742
Come over here, Sophie.

858
01:19:34,084 --> 01:19:36,003
I added another bedroom, too.

859
01:19:36,461 --> 01:19:37,505
Have a look.

860
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:44,902
Oh.

861
01:19:47,774 --> 01:19:49,621
Why'd you do this?

862
01:19:49,766 --> 01:19:53,125
So we'd have a room that suited you. Do you like it?

863
01:19:54,533 --> 01:19:57,828
Of course. It's perfect for a cleaning lady.

864
01:19:57,927 --> 01:20:01,291
I got you some new clothes,
too. But you can open them later.

865
01:20:02,223 --> 01:20:04,454
Come on, Sophie. Look at this.

866
01:20:04,990 --> 01:20:06,615
All right, a courtyard!

867
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,641
That shop's ours, too.

868
01:20:09,174 --> 01:20:10,515
Heen! Come on!

869
01:20:11,163 --> 01:20:14,641
See that new color on the dial? There's a new portal.

870
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,408
It's a present for you. Come see.

871
01:20:29,723 --> 01:20:30,515
Oh!

872
01:20:45,822 --> 01:20:47,699
You like it? It's my secret garden.

873
01:20:48,288 --> 01:20:50,001
It's incredible.

874
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:54,643
Did you use your magic to make this?

875
01:20:55,082 --> 01:20:57,861
Only a little, just to help the flowers grow.

876
01:21:06,635 --> 01:21:08,983
This place is gorgeous, Howl!

877
01:21:09,346 --> 01:21:10,801
It's like a dream.

878
01:21:34,454 --> 01:21:35,121
Sophie?

879
01:21:36,498 --> 01:21:40,444
It all seems so familiar, yet I
know I've never been here before.

880
01:21:41,044 --> 01:21:43,113
I feel so at home.

881
01:21:43,463 --> 01:21:44,228
Come with me.

882
01:21:44,253 --> 01:21:44,989
Okay.

883
01:21:53,056 --> 01:21:53,904
Look there.

884
01:21:59,649 --> 01:22:01,164
What a cute cottage.

885
01:22:01,189 --> 01:22:03,191
That was my secret hideaway.

886
01:22:03,567 --> 01:22:06,527
I spent a lot of time here by myself when I was young.

887
01:22:09,165 --> 01:22:10,542
You were alone?

888
01:22:10,726 --> 01:22:15,012
My uncle, who was a wizard, gave
me this place as my private study.

889
01:22:15,166 --> 01:22:17,516
Now you can come here whenever you like.

890
01:22:21,585 --> 01:22:22,577
What's the matter?

891
01:22:23,079 --> 01:22:25,223
It's... You're scaring me.

892
01:22:25,255 --> 01:22:27,757
I have this weird feeling that you're going to leave.

893
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:35,474
Howl, tell me what's going on.
Please. I don't care if you're a monster.

894
01:22:40,854 --> 01:22:44,514
I'm setting things up so that all of
you can live a comfortable life. Sophie

895
01:22:44,775 --> 01:22:49,145
With all the flowers you've got in this
valley, you could easily open up a flower shop.

896
01:22:49,446 --> 01:22:51,870
Right? I'm sure you'd be good at it.

897
01:22:52,324 --> 01:22:54,229
So, you are going away.

898
01:22:55,869 --> 01:22:58,703
Please, Howl, I know I can be of help to you.

899
01:22:59,106 --> 01:23:03,127
Even though I'm not pretty,
and all I'm good at is cleaning.

900
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:05,741
Sophie! Sophie, you're beautiful!

901
01:23:10,425 --> 01:23:14,400
Well, the nice thing about being
old is you've got nothing much to lose.

902
01:23:16,769 --> 01:23:17,237
Hmm?

903
01:23:27,526 --> 01:23:29,436
What is that thing doing out here?

904
01:23:29,461 --> 01:23:30,493
A battleship?

905
01:23:30,518 --> 01:23:32,493
Still looking for more cities to burn.

906
01:23:32,518 --> 01:23:34,466
Is it the enemy's or one of ours?

907
01:23:34,491 --> 01:23:36,159
What difference does it make?

908
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,331
Those stupid murderers.

909
01:23:56,888 --> 01:23:59,881
We can't just let them fly off with all those bombs.

910
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:18,774
What's happening? What did you do?

911
01:24:18,963 --> 01:24:21,315
Just messed with it. It won't crash, though.

912
01:24:23,157 --> 01:24:24,072
Oh!

913
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:26,281
Howl!

914
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:28,879
Uh-oh. Here they come.

915
01:24:38,335 --> 01:24:41,148
Those things are Suliman's henchmen. Let's go.

916
01:24:41,586 --> 01:24:43,920
Faster! We need to take off!

917
01:24:57,679 --> 01:24:59,236
All right, you're going in.

918
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:01,721
No! Don't let go!

919
01:25:10,348 --> 01:25:12,097
Sophie, what happened?

920
01:25:12,435 --> 01:25:15,585
Oh! I'm too old to be treated like this!

921
01:25:25,183 --> 01:25:26,788
Uh, good night, Sophie.

922
01:25:26,877 --> 01:25:28,209
Good night, Michael.

923
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:32,692
Oh, don't worry about Master Howl, Sophie.

924
01:25:32,776 --> 01:25:35,219
Sometimes he likes to go away for days on end.

925
01:25:35,487 --> 01:25:37,482
Thank you. That's good to know.

926
01:25:37,605 --> 01:25:38,802
Need anything else?

927
01:25:38,827 --> 01:25:40,173
No, I'm fine.

928
01:25:40,198 --> 01:25:42,018
Well. Good night, then.

929
01:25:42,531 --> 01:25:43,699
You're in love.

930
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:49,963
Don't deny it. You've been sighing all day.

931
01:26:01,270 --> 01:26:03,097
Hmm. Just as I thought.

932
01:26:03,372 --> 01:26:05,543
Have you ever been in love before?

933
01:26:05,969 --> 01:26:09,056
Of course I have. I'm still in love.

934
01:26:10,138 --> 01:26:13,281
Strapping, young men are so difficult to deal with.

935
01:26:13,618 --> 01:26:16,452
But their hearts, I just adore.

936
01:26:16,611 --> 01:26:17,771
You're terrible.

937
01:26:18,154 --> 01:26:20,344
And they're so cute, too.

938
01:26:24,536 --> 01:26:25,716
What's that?

939
01:26:25,829 --> 01:26:27,781
It's an air raid siren.

940
01:26:28,529 --> 01:26:29,530
Air raid?

941
01:26:30,651 --> 01:26:32,236
It's a long way's off.

942
01:26:32,261 --> 01:26:34,876
But you better not go outside tonight, dear.

943
01:26:35,839 --> 01:26:40,261
I'm sure Suliman's henchmen are
looking everywhere for this place.

944
01:26:43,566 --> 01:26:45,093
What a good fire.

945
01:26:45,777 --> 01:26:47,820
He keeps this house so well hidden.

946
01:27:23,011 --> 01:27:25,597
Sophie, there's a strange lady in here!

947
01:27:33,237 --> 01:27:34,194
Mother?

948
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:36,005
Sophie!

949
01:27:39,086 --> 01:27:42,213
Thank goodness you're here! I searched everywhere for you!

950
01:27:42,238 --> 01:27:45,158
Oh, my, look at your face, you're so old!

951
01:27:45,241 --> 01:27:48,088
Everyone's saying it's my fault that you left!

952
01:27:48,411 --> 01:27:52,682
You'll forgive me, oh, won't you? Oh, Sophie!

953
01:27:52,707 --> 01:27:53,529
Mother.

954
01:27:56,662 --> 01:27:59,255
I barely recognize the place.

955
01:27:59,357 --> 01:28:02,557
Who is that woman? Huh? The landlady?

956
01:28:02,771 --> 01:28:05,972
Oh! I forgot to tell you! I got married again!

957
01:28:06,262 --> 01:28:09,074
He's such a nice man, and he's filthy rich, too,

958
01:28:09,099 --> 01:28:11,153
so we can all live together again!

959
01:28:11,267 --> 01:28:13,942
You won't have to work as a cleaning lady any more.

960
01:28:14,221 --> 01:28:17,445
That's all right, Mother. I actually like living here.

961
01:28:17,732 --> 01:28:20,457
Really? Oh! I forgot!

962
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:22,808
I've got a car waiting. I've gotta run.

963
01:28:23,972 --> 01:28:26,336
Sophie, I'm so glad I found you.

964
01:28:41,345 --> 01:28:44,793
A peeping bug? Can't Suliman do better than that?

965
01:28:45,127 --> 01:28:47,087
Open wide, Cal.

966
01:28:55,797 --> 01:28:58,606
I hope you and your new husband will be very happy.

967
01:28:58,732 --> 01:29:00,968
Thank you, Sophie. Bye.

968
01:29:01,024 --> 01:29:02,064
Bye, Mother.

969
01:29:05,321 --> 01:29:08,408
I did what I was told. Now take me to my husband.

970
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:11,846
Yes, ma'am. I'm sure Madame
Suliman will be very pleased with you.

971
01:29:13,838 --> 01:29:15,631
Forgive me, Sophie.

972
01:29:19,807 --> 01:29:21,434
Wow. Look at all of them.

973
01:29:21,671 --> 01:29:25,057
If they keep leaving at this
rate, the town will soon be empty.

974
01:29:25,258 --> 01:29:26,956
Do you want to leave, too, Sophie?

975
01:29:27,138 --> 01:29:28,202
What?

976
01:29:28,553 --> 01:29:30,840
That lady said she wants you to live with her now.

977
01:29:30,913 --> 01:29:34,661
Yes, well, at least she cared enough to visit.

978
01:29:34,809 --> 01:29:36,497
Don't leave, Sophie.

979
01:29:37,470 --> 01:29:39,811
I love you. You have to stay.

980
01:29:41,357 --> 01:29:45,213
On, I love you, too, Michael. I'll stay.

981
01:29:45,612 --> 01:29:46,373
Really?

982
01:29:46,627 --> 01:29:47,436
Mmm-hmm.

983
01:29:47,655 --> 01:29:49,137
Because we're a family now.

984
01:29:49,532 --> 01:29:51,568
Yes, we're a family.

985
01:29:51,618 --> 01:29:52,998
Thank you, Sophie.

986
01:30:01,103 --> 01:30:04,511
I'll never let Suliman get a hold of Howl.

987
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:23,191
But the newspaper says we won.

988
01:30:23,274 --> 01:30:26,582
Only idiots believe what they read in the paper.

989
01:30:27,237 --> 01:30:30,720
That's so strange. I can't get Calcifer going.

990
01:30:31,611 --> 01:30:35,019
Do you have to keep smoking that? It smells terrible.

991
01:30:35,387 --> 01:30:38,259
Don't deny an witcher pleasures, young lady.

992
01:30:38,498 --> 01:30:40,509
Michael, will you crack a window, please?

993
01:30:40,548 --> 01:30:41,334
Mmm-hmm.

994
01:30:44,116 --> 01:30:47,365
I wouldn't open that window, If ll were you, dear.

995
01:30:48,299 --> 01:30:51,441
Calcifer's too weak right now to protect this place.

996
01:30:51,466 --> 01:30:53,728
Suliman's henchmen could get in.

997
01:30:54,875 --> 01:30:55,834
Michael!!

998
01:31:06,699 --> 01:31:07,632
Get back!

999
01:31:14,642 --> 01:31:17,515
Michael, get back inside. I'm going to check on the shop.

1000
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:18,142
Mmm-hmm.

1001
01:31:35,972 --> 01:31:37,507
There are bombs falling on us!

1002
01:31:37,599 --> 01:31:40,478
Why can't you put out some fires instead?

1003
01:32:04,767 --> 01:32:06,275
Howl! No!

1004
01:32:09,535 --> 01:32:10,414
Oh!

1005
01:32:19,595 --> 01:32:20,937
This is exciting.

1006
01:32:34,238 --> 01:32:35,319
Howl!

1007
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:39,863
I'm sorry, Sophie. I should've gotten here sooner.

1008
01:32:40,227 --> 01:32:43,454
You're alive! Oh, thank goodness!

1009
01:33:00,056 --> 01:33:02,350
Master Howl!! Sophie! You're okay!

1010
01:33:04,771 --> 01:33:08,099
Calcifer. You hang in there, now.

1011
01:33:12,612 --> 01:33:16,941
Tell me, was that cigar a gift
from Madame Suliman by any chance?

1012
01:33:17,207 --> 01:33:20,453
Howl, she fed me something gross. I feel sick.

1013
01:33:20,536 --> 01:33:23,471
Why, if it isn't Howl.

1014
01:33:23,705 --> 01:33:27,763
I think you and I need to have a
nice, long, heart-to-heart chat.

1015
01:33:28,051 --> 01:33:32,036
There's nothing I'd like more than
that, but right now there's a war going on.

1016
01:33:33,256 --> 01:33:36,606
How unlike you, Howl, not running away anymore.

1017
01:33:36,987 --> 01:33:38,409
Until later, then.

1018
01:33:39,418 --> 01:33:42,374
Stay here. Calcifer will protect you from the henchmen.

1019
01:33:42,598 --> 01:33:44,289
I'll stand guard out front.

1020
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:50,383
No, wait! Howl! Don't go out there. It's too dangerous.

1021
01:33:50,624 --> 01:33:52,075
Another wave's coming.

1022
01:33:52,275 --> 01:33:54,236
And Calcifer's too weak to stop the bombs.

1023
01:33:54,277 --> 01:33:56,635
Let's run! Don't fight them, Howl.

1024
01:33:56,779 --> 01:33:59,686
Sorry. I've had enough of running away, Sophie.

1025
01:34:00,234 --> 01:34:03,772
Now I've got something I want to protect. It's you.

1026
01:34:09,417 --> 01:34:10,625
Come back!

1027
01:34:25,616 --> 01:34:26,158
Hmm!

1028
01:35:34,961 --> 01:35:36,408
There's where we are, at the shop.

1029
01:35:40,883 --> 01:35:42,359
Looks like Howl's in trouble.

1030
01:35:51,537 --> 01:35:52,656
Howl, look out!

1031
01:36:02,405 --> 01:36:04,478
What's going on? Turnip!

1032
01:36:08,327 --> 01:36:09,690
Michael, I need your help.

1033
01:36:09,746 --> 01:36:10,308
Huh?

1034
01:36:10,483 --> 01:36:13,488
Are you crazy? I can't move
the portals without Howl's help.

1035
01:36:13,513 --> 01:36:16,878
You have to try. If we don't break away,
Howl will keep protecting that hat shop.

1036
01:36:16,936 --> 01:36:18,855
I've preferred him as a coward.

1037
01:36:18,963 --> 01:36:20,606
Okay, we have to go now.

1038
01:36:20,743 --> 01:36:22,282
Are we going for a stroll?

1039
01:36:22,341 --> 01:36:24,635
We can't do that. It'll make us too vulnerable!

1040
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:26,012
We already are.

1041
01:36:26,095 --> 01:36:28,431
And if we don't move quick, Howl doesn't have a chance.

1042
01:36:28,456 --> 01:36:31,200
Sophie! They're about to bomb the hat shop!

1043
01:36:31,225 --> 01:36:33,284
Quick. Help her get outside, okay?

1044
01:36:33,309 --> 01:36:33,848
Right.

1045
01:36:36,701 --> 01:36:38,274
You're coming with us. Hop on.

1046
01:36:38,317 --> 01:36:40,172
I can't! It's impossible!

1047
01:36:40,197 --> 01:36:42,311
No one but Howl can take me out of this hearth.

1048
01:36:42,361 --> 01:36:45,186
There's no time to lose,Calcifer.
We have to try something.

1049
01:36:45,364 --> 01:36:47,244
Oh! Don't do this! No, no!

1050
01:36:47,283 --> 01:36:49,619
Help, help, crazy lady with a shovel! Don't...

1051
01:36:49,858 --> 01:36:52,847
If you take me out that door, the castle could collapse.

1052
01:36:52,872 --> 01:36:53,671
Good!

1053
01:36:57,460 --> 01:36:58,385
We're ready.

1054
01:36:58,410 --> 01:36:59,270
Okay, step back.

1055
01:36:59,295 --> 01:37:01,681
Make sure I go out last, Sophie.

1056
01:37:01,955 --> 01:37:05,382
I don't know what's gonna happen,
but I'm sure it won't be good.

1057
01:37:33,955 --> 01:37:38,107
I told you it would collapse. Rain! Rain!

1058
01:37:40,795 --> 01:37:42,270
That ship's headed for town!

1059
01:37:42,296 --> 01:37:43,839
Michael, look after her, okay?

1060
01:37:43,867 --> 01:37:45,750
Turnip-head, help me find a way back in.

1061
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:49,611
Don't you worry, now, ma'am,
I'm gonna take good care of you.

1062
01:37:52,417 --> 01:37:54,294
Michael, here's a way in!

1063
01:38:05,464 --> 01:38:07,266
The roof's leaking. Don't let me get wet!

1064
01:38:07,361 --> 01:38:08,570
Hold on for a second.

1065
01:38:08,614 --> 01:38:11,031
It's wet here, Sophie! Ah!

1066
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:15,146
Too damp, too damp, very damp here!

1067
01:38:15,561 --> 01:38:16,687
Hurry! Hurry!

1068
01:38:16,792 --> 01:38:17,999
Hurry, please!

1069
01:38:25,810 --> 01:38:27,478
Michael, hurry, get inside.

1070
01:38:27,717 --> 01:38:29,335
The castle's a wreck.

1071
01:38:29,719 --> 01:38:33,165
Told you we should have stayed
put. Howl and I could have handled it.

1072
01:38:35,474 --> 01:38:38,496
We have to tell Howl we're not
attached to the hat shop now.

1073
01:38:38,602 --> 01:38:40,641
Move the castle and take us to Howl.

1074
01:38:40,777 --> 01:38:42,230
Ah! What?

1075
01:38:42,732 --> 01:38:46,640
I know you can do it. I've
never seen a fire with more spark.

1076
01:38:46,736 --> 01:38:50,489
But there's no chimney here,
and I keep getting dripped on.

1077
01:38:50,573 --> 01:38:52,049
And the wood's all damp.

1078
01:38:52,074 --> 01:38:56,713
They say that the best blaze brightest
when circumstances are at their worst.

1079
01:38:56,888 --> 01:38:59,089
Yeah, but no one really believes that.

1080
01:38:59,498 --> 01:39:00,725
Come on, let's be honest.

1081
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:03,214
Oh! What a pretty fire.

1082
01:39:03,239 --> 01:39:04,666
Why don't you have a seat.

1083
01:39:04,712 --> 01:39:07,423
All right. I need something of yours, Sophie.

1084
01:39:07,686 --> 01:39:08,648
Why's that?

1085
01:39:08,673 --> 01:39:11,477
I can't do it by myself. How about your eyes?

1086
01:39:11,552 --> 01:39:13,853
Huh? How about this?

1087
01:39:36,869 --> 01:39:38,162
Ah!

1088
01:40:04,146 --> 01:40:05,689
Ah!

1089
01:40:19,703 --> 01:40:22,487
Thanks, Calcifer. You're fantastic!

1090
01:40:22,593 --> 01:40:25,792
Imagine what I could've done
with your eyes. Or your heart.

1091
01:40:25,945 --> 01:40:28,740
That's it! You've got Howl's heart!

1092
01:40:31,315 --> 01:40:32,776
I found it!

1093
01:40:45,248 --> 01:40:48,642
I can see Howl down there. Looks like he's trapped!

1094
01:40:53,446 --> 01:40:55,133
Calcifer, hurry!

1095
01:40:55,990 --> 01:40:57,589
No!

1096
01:40:58,176 --> 01:40:59,422
Put it back!

1097
01:40:59,521 --> 01:41:01,266
Let go!

1098
01:41:01,817 --> 01:41:04,699
Howl's heart, it's mine!

1099
01:41:15,428 --> 01:41:17,140
Put it back now!

1100
01:41:19,138 --> 01:41:20,295
It's hot! Ah!

1101
01:41:20,723 --> 01:41:21,653
It's burning me!

1102
01:41:21,678 --> 01:41:22,717
Let go!

1103
01:41:22,867 --> 01:41:24,814
You're catching on fire!

1104
01:41:25,787 --> 01:41:31,925
No, it's mine. It's mine! It's mine!

1105
01:41:41,660 --> 01:41:42,809
Ah!

1106
01:41:45,372 --> 01:41:47,157
Sophie!

1107
01:41:50,628 --> 01:41:52,257
Sophie!

1108
01:41:52,282 --> 01:41:53,988
Sophie ruined it!

1109
01:41:54,089 --> 01:41:55,990
My heart's ruined!

1110
01:42:39,692 --> 01:42:43,574
Heen, what have I done? I poured water on Calcifer!

1111
01:42:45,724 --> 01:42:48,102
What if I killed Howl, too?

1112
01:43:15,045 --> 01:43:17,737
It's moving. Is Howl still alive?

1113
01:43:18,109 --> 01:43:19,628
Can you lead me to him?

1114
01:43:41,530 --> 01:43:43,027
The front door.

1115
01:45:01,443 --> 01:45:02,334
Heen.

1116
01:45:38,063 --> 01:45:39,308
That's Howl.

1117
01:45:57,666 --> 01:46:00,688
I know where I am. I'm in Howl's childhood.

1118
01:46:24,151 --> 01:46:25,112
Oh!

1119
01:47:19,257 --> 01:47:21,814
Howl! Calcifer!

1120
01:47:22,947 --> 01:47:24,799
It's me, Sophie!

1121
01:47:25,072 --> 01:47:27,461
I know how to help you now.

1122
01:47:27,965 --> 01:47:30,870
Find me in the future!

1123
01:48:03,207 --> 01:48:05,804
Sorry, Heen. I'm trying to hurry.

1124
01:48:06,628 --> 01:48:08,505
I just can't seem to stop crying.

1125
01:48:32,905 --> 01:48:33,850
Howl.

1126
01:48:40,621 --> 01:48:43,321
I'm sorry. Did I come too late?

1127
01:48:43,702 --> 01:48:46,045
I didn't mean to make you wait this long.

1128
01:48:50,647 --> 01:48:53,697
I need you to take me to Calcifer if you can.

1129
01:49:56,738 --> 01:49:57,869
He's dead?

1130
01:49:58,138 --> 01:49:59,519
No, Michael.

1131
01:50:03,838 --> 01:50:05,398
Howl needs that back now.

1132
01:50:05,423 --> 01:50:08,958
Don't look at me. I don't have it. I
don't know what you're talking about.

1133
01:50:09,529 --> 01:50:10,655
Please.

1134
01:50:12,379 --> 01:50:13,812
Please give it back.

1135
01:50:16,944 --> 01:50:19,720
You really want it that badly?

1136
01:50:19,928 --> 01:50:20,804
Yes.

1137
01:50:22,097 --> 01:50:23,221
All right, then.

1138
01:50:23,606 --> 01:50:25,287
You'd better take good care of it.

1139
01:50:25,312 --> 01:50:26,278
Okay.

1140
01:50:26,389 --> 01:50:27,580
Here, dear.

1141
01:50:28,941 --> 01:50:31,084
Thank you, you have a big heart.

1142
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:48,199
Calcifer.

1143
01:50:50,208 --> 01:50:52,489
Sophie, I'm so tired.

1144
01:50:52,621 --> 01:50:56,150
If I give Howl back his heart, what will happen to you?

1145
01:50:56,339 --> 01:50:59,042
I'll be okay if you do it. I think.

1146
01:50:59,262 --> 01:51:03,149
I mean,you dumped water on me,
and Howl and I both survived.

1147
01:51:03,725 --> 01:51:05,366
I better try then.

1148
01:51:08,643 --> 01:51:11,722
It's so warm and fluttering like a bird.

1149
01:51:11,980 --> 01:51:14,329
It's still just the heart of a child.

1150
01:51:15,442 --> 01:51:18,087
Please, help Calicifer live.

1151
01:51:18,542 --> 01:51:21,026
And please help Howl take back his heart.

1152
01:51:33,545 --> 01:51:36,688
I'm alive! I'm alive! Look, I'm free!

1153
01:51:36,713 --> 01:51:40,746
Free! Free! I'm alive!

1154
01:51:42,399 --> 01:51:44,352
He moved! See?

1155
01:51:49,235 --> 01:51:51,145
It can't stand without Calcifer!

1156
01:52:05,784 --> 01:52:07,074
Turnip!

1157
01:52:19,630 --> 01:52:21,123
His pole snapped!

1158
01:52:21,216 --> 01:52:23,569
Are you all right? We'll get you a new pole, okay?

1159
01:52:25,846 --> 01:52:27,662
You saved us, Turnip.

1160
01:52:35,856 --> 01:52:37,306
Thank you, Sophie.

1161
01:52:38,275 --> 01:52:40,754
I'm the prince who's being
missing from the neighboring kingdom.

1162
01:52:40,944 --> 01:52:43,327
Somehow I got that blasted spell put on me.

1163
01:52:43,405 --> 01:52:46,799
I know that spell. A kiss from your true love breaks this.

1164
01:52:46,950 --> 01:52:51,526
That's right. If it weren't for Sophie, I
would be a scarecrow for the rest of my life.

1165
01:52:51,621 --> 01:52:53,957
My, what a strapping young man you are.

1166
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:56,459
What's going on? What am I doing here?

1167
01:52:56,529 --> 01:53:00,321
I feel terrible, like there's a weight on my chest.

1168
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:02,924
A heart's a heavy burden.

1169
01:53:03,216 --> 01:53:06,764
Wow! Sophie, your hair looks just like starlight.

1170
01:53:07,012 --> 01:53:08,178
It's beautiful.

1171
01:53:08,471 --> 01:53:11,023
You think so? So do I!

1172
01:53:12,893 --> 01:53:15,645
Looks like your true love is in love with someone else.

1173
01:53:15,689 --> 01:53:19,437
You should go home anyway, and
tell your king to stop this dumb war.

1174
01:53:19,508 --> 01:53:21,328
Yes, that's exactly what I'll do.

1175
01:53:21,443 --> 01:53:24,410
One thing you can always count on is that hearts change.

1176
01:53:24,704 --> 01:53:27,453
So as soon as this war is over, I shall return.

1177
01:53:27,733 --> 01:53:30,152
I love it when you talk like that.

1178
01:53:30,285 --> 01:53:32,649
I look forward to your return, big boy.

1179
01:53:39,666 --> 01:53:43,161
There you are. You should have checked in earlier.

1180
01:53:43,473 --> 01:53:45,434
What on earth were you up to?

1181
01:53:48,494 --> 01:53:50,739
Howl found his true love.

1182
01:53:50,934 --> 01:53:52,797
You little traitor.

1183
01:53:59,511 --> 01:54:01,354
The game is over.

1184
01:54:01,927 --> 01:54:05,064
Get me the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense.

1185
01:54:06,029 --> 01:54:09,101
It's time to put an end to this idiotic war.

1186
01:54:09,126 --> 01:54:09,664
Yes, ma'am.

1187
01:54:10,293 --> 01:54:12,103
Hey, it's Calcifer!

1188
01:54:12,521 --> 01:54:14,876
You didn't have to come back, Calcifer.

1189
01:54:17,666 --> 01:54:21,002
I Kind of missed you guys. And
it looks like it's gonna rain.

1190
01:54:21,119 --> 01:54:23,131
I missed you, too, Calcifer.

1191
01:54:24,172 --> 01:54:25,077
Wow!
