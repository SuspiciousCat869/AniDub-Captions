00:10:33.973 --> 00:10:36.009 position:16% line:83% align:start
is about to have a baby,
can you believe it?

00:10:36.042 --> 00:10:37.977 position:5% line:83% align:start
She told us you'd be
taking care of the house

00:10:38.011 --> 00:10:39.879 position:5% line:83% align:start
and looking after the kids,
is that right?

00:10:39.913 --> 00:10:42.016 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah, no, it's just 'cause
I decided to go freelance

00:10:42.049 --> 00:10:43.783 position:21% line:83% align:start
so I'll be working
from home from now on

00:10:43.817 --> 00:10:45.585 position:13% line:83% align:start
which means I'll have time
to take breaks

00:10:45.618 --> 00:10:47.922 position:21% line:83% align:start
and tidy up around
the house and stuff.

00:10:47.955 --> 00:10:49.690 position:10% line:77% align:start
Must be nice.
That's impressive.

00:10:49.723 --> 00:10:52.059 position:33% line:77% align:start
It's nothing.
I wish my husband did that.

00:10:52.092 --> 00:10:53.594 position:24% line:89% align:start
Stop, it's nothing.

[father humming]

00:11:01.435 --> 00:11:03.605 position:61% line:77% align:start
Hmm, what?
Nothing.

00:11:03.638 --> 00:11:05.574 position:41% line:83% align:start
You can tell me.
Come on, what's up?

00:11:05.607 --> 00:11:07.776 position:5% line:77% align:start
All right, if you insist.
Mm-hmm.

00:11:07.809 --> 00:11:09.611 position:5% line:83% align:start
You just can't help
yourself, can you?

00:11:09.644 --> 00:11:11.413 position:5% line:83% align:start
Doing your
"I'm the perfect husband" act

00:11:11.446 --> 00:11:13.015 position:5% line:83% align:start
in front of all
the other moms.

00:11:13.049 --> 00:11:16.652 position:55% line:71% align:start

You do realize they can

No!

around the corner
and I'll be back at work soon,

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.672 position:16% line:77% align:start
which means you'll have
to actually start
taking care of the house

00:11:35.706 --> 00:11:37.808 position:16% line:83% align:start
instead of just bragging
to others about it.

00:11:39.543 --> 00:11:40.677 position:41% line:89% align:start
I know.

00:11:40.711 --> 00:11:42.546 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can't do everything
by myself

00:11:42.579 --> 00:11:44.581 position:5% line:83% align:start
like I did
when Kun was born.

00:11:45.449 --> 00:11:46.551 position:41% line:89% align:start

[soft music playing]

00:11:48.019 --> 00:11:49.988 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm your big brother,
so I'm gonna teach you

00:11:50.021 --> 00:11:51.856 position:33% line:83% align:start
a lot of
different stuff, okay?

00:11:53.658 --> 00:11:55.127 position:16% line:89% align:start
First, I'll take you outside

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.662 position:21% line:83% align:start
and I'm gonna teach you

There's a scorpion! See?

[Yumi] She's too little
to go outside just yet.

00:12:08.241 --> 00:12:10.709 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can take her when
she's a bit bigger, all right?

00:12:10.743 --> 00:12:12.112 position:35% line:89% align:start

00:12:26.127 --> 00:12:28.729 position:19% line:83% align:start
The witch was woken up
by Mr. Mustache,

00:12:28.763 --> 00:12:30.731 position:30% line:83% align:start
so she got mad
and chased him.

00:12:31.799 --> 00:12:33.601 position:21% line:89% align:start
And Mr. Mustache ran.

00:12:33.634 --> 00:12:36.971 position:10% line:83% align:start
He got away by jumping onto
a train on the Yamanote line.

a different train
on the Keihin line,

Hey, Dad!

Oh, wow, she's

and your world
was turned upside down

when all that affection
they had for you

you couldn't help yourself

[chuckles]
Did I get it right?

can't you tell?

00:16:57.015 --> 00:16:59.185 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yeah, of this house.

00:16:59.452 --> 00:17:02.422 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've been here since
before you were born.

00:17:02.455 --> 00:17:03.456 position:64% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:03.489 --> 00:17:07.060 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now, you must kneel before me
because I'm royalty.

00:17:10.797 --> 00:17:13.866 position:5% line:83% align:start
You know, long ago,
Mom and Dad used to shower me

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.036 position:5% line:83% align:start
with love
and dote on me as well.

00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:18.138 position:5% line:89% align:start
I had all of their attention.

00:17:18.172 --> 00:17:20.975 position:5% line:83% align:start
They constantly told me
what a good boy I was

00:17:21.008 --> 00:17:23.210 position:5% line:83% align:start
and would stroke
my head lovingly.

00:17:23.978 --> 00:17:27.249 position:24% line:77% align:start
Then all that changed!
Ever since the day you
showed up on the doorstep

00:17:27.282 --> 00:17:29.050 position:33% line:83% align:start
they've stopped paying
attention to me.

00:17:29.084 --> 00:17:30.485 position:50% line:83% align:start
Suddenly, all of
my organic meals

00:17:30.518 --> 00:17:32.287 position:19% line:83% align:start
were changed to
the regular generic brands,

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.189 position:27% line:83% align:start
not to mention
the reduction in snacks,

00:17:34.222 --> 00:17:35.924 position:47% line:83% align:start
and they stopped
complimenting me,

00:17:35.957 --> 00:17:39.060 position:13% line:83% align:start
they'd only ever scold me
or just completely ignore me.

00:17:39.094 --> 00:17:41.497 position:5% line:83% align:start
But then I realized
what was going on.

00:17:42.431 --> 00:17:46.135 position:5% line:83% align:start
Their love was being
taken from me.

00:17:46.369 --> 00:17:49.272 position:5% line:83% align:start
[sighs] It made me feel
so empty inside

00:17:49.305 --> 00:17:51.374 position:5% line:83% align:start
like a wolf rejected
from its pack.

00:17:51.408 --> 00:17:53.075 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you know what
that feels like?

00:17:53.109 --> 00:17:54.211 position:55% line:89% align:start
No, I don't.

00:17:54.244 --> 00:17:56.879 position:5% line:83% align:start
What?
Are you sure about that?

00:17:57.381 --> 00:18:00.250 position:21% line:83% align:start

is that old story about

really true?

00:24:58.297 --> 00:24:59.398 position:61% line:89% align:start
Which story?

When Grandpa proposed,

she would marry him
under one condition.

00:25:02.802 --> 00:25:04.470 position:5% line:83% align:start
She told him that
she would say yes,

00:25:04.503 --> 00:25:07.741 position:5% line:83% align:start
but only if he could run faster
than her, so they competed

00:25:07.774 --> 00:25:10.376 position:5% line:83% align:start
and Grandpa ended up winning
the race and her heart too.

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:13.446 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have no clue. I've never
heard that story before.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.814 position:5% line:89% align:start
What?

00:25:14.848 --> 00:25:17.051 position:5% line:83% align:start
But Uncle Yamato told me
that story at the funeral.

00:25:17.084 --> 00:25:19.352 position:33% line:83% align:start
I really doubt there's
any truth to that,

00:25:19.385 --> 00:25:20.420 position:44% line:89% align:start
Dad had a bad leg.

00:25:20.453 --> 00:25:22.389 position:5% line:89% align:start
What, so he just lied?

00:25:22.423 --> 00:25:23.958 position:10% line:77% align:start
[grandma]
I don't know about that,
it was probably just a rumor.

00:25:23.991 --> 00:25:25.993 position:19% line:83% align:start
[grandpa] Oh, hey,
speaking of tall tales,

00:25:26.026 --> 00:25:28.395 position:19% line:83% align:start
what's the superstition
about the dolls again?

00:25:28.429 --> 00:25:30.564 position:10% line:83% align:start
[grandma] It's that if
they're not put away in time,

00:25:30.598 --> 00:25:32.466 position:10% line:89% align:start
her marriage will be delayed.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.836 position:19% line:77% align:start
[Yumi] Oh, come on,
no one believes
in that stuff nowadays.

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:37.439 position:27% line:83% align:start
But how late are
we talking here?

00:25:37.472 --> 00:25:40.075 position:13% line:83% align:start
[grandma] One year for
each day they're left out.

00:25:40.108 --> 00:25:44.379 position:16% line:77% align:start
[Yumi] Oh, please.
How do they even come up
with this stuff?

00:25:44.412 --> 00:25:47.650 position:7% line:83% align:start
[grandma] It's superstition.
Who knows where it comes from.

00:25:50.486 --> 00:25:51.821 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh, no.

00:25:52.588 --> 00:25:54.690 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, I'm gonna be so late.

00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.729 position:33% line:83% align:start
Okay, Kun,
Mommy has to go away

00:25:59.762 --> 00:26:01.597 position:5% line:83% align:start
for a few days
on a business trip.

00:26:01.631 --> 00:26:02.431 position:38% line:89% align:start
Don't go!

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.935 position:5% line:83% align:start
You better be good
while I'm gone, okay?

00:26:04.968 --> 00:26:05.869 position:30% line:89% align:start
No!

00:26:05.903 --> 00:26:07.004 position:5% line:83% align:start
And don't
forget to tell Daddy

00:26:07.037 --> 00:26:08.872 position:5% line:83% align:start
when you need to go
to the bathroom.

00:26:08.906 --> 00:26:09.706 position:50% line:89% align:start
Mommy, no!

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.675 position:5% line:83% align:start
All right, the kids
are in your hands.

00:26:11.708 --> 00:26:13.744 position:16% line:77% align:start
[Kun] Mommy!
Don't worry, I got this.

00:26:13.777 --> 00:26:15.479 position:16% line:77% align:start
Okay.
Mommy!

00:26:15.512 --> 00:26:16.714 position:30% line:89% align:start
I don't want you to go!

00:26:16.748 --> 00:26:18.016 position:16% line:83% align:start
Don't forget to
put the dolls away today.

00:26:18.049 --> 00:26:20.485 position:58% line:77% align:start
[father] Yup.
Bye, see you in a few days.

00:26:20.518 --> 00:26:21.986 position:24% line:89% align:start

Come on, let's go.

I know, I know.

00:26:36.769 --> 00:26:38.470 position:35% line:83% align:start
Excuse me,
is this the drop off?

00:26:41.908 --> 00:26:42.943 position:64% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:26:44.778 --> 00:26:47.814 position:16% line:89% align:start
Is this machine washable?

00:26:56.423 --> 00:26:58.926 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, no, what's she doing?
What's happening?

00:26:59.093 --> 00:27:00.661 position:24% line:89% align:start
Uh, it's that late?

Why isn't Mommy here?

00:27:11.539 --> 00:27:12.707 position:38% line:83% align:start
Okay,
let's just get home.

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:14.943 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let's take a nap, okay?

Why don't you go next door

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.453 position:7% line:89% align:start
and see if the kids wanna play?

00:27:56.487 --> 00:27:58.089 position:13% line:89% align:start
But I wanna play with you.

00:27:58.123 --> 00:28:00.625 position:13% line:83% align:start
[father] I thought
you'd rather be with Mommy?

00:28:01.192 --> 00:28:04.029 position:24% line:83% align:start
I changed my mind.
Let's play.

Hmm. Yeah.

Yeah, that sounds good.
[Kun] Let's read a book.

No, wait!
Let's watch a video!

Just go tell Dad to hurry up

00:32:41.259 --> 00:32:43.261 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Mirai nervously]
I'd rather you not do it.

00:32:43.294 --> 00:32:45.296 position:44% line:77% align:start
But why?
[Mirai] Stop doing that!

00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:48.333 position:27% line:89% align:start
I have no choice.

00:33:02.948 --> 00:33:04.049 position:50% line:89% align:start
Oh, no, the box!

00:33:04.083 --> 00:33:05.485 position:33% line:89% align:start
Where is it?

00:33:14.527 --> 00:33:15.962 position:50% line:89% align:start
Found it.

00:33:20.834 --> 00:33:22.102 position:52% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:33:33.014 --> 00:33:34.215 position:55% line:77% align:start
Huh?

[wincing]

00:33:46.995 --> 00:33:49.231 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, my God! She's gone!

00:33:49.264 --> 00:33:52.234 position:30% line:83% align:start
Where's Mirai?
Mirai! Mirai!

00:33:52.268 --> 00:33:53.569 position:21% line:89% align:start
Where are you, baby?

00:33:54.404 --> 00:33:55.271 position:33% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:33:56.139 --> 00:33:59.075 position:21% line:83% align:start
There you are!
You just slipped off.

[exhales in relief]

00:34:02.211 --> 00:34:04.347 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on, up you go.

00:34:06.283 --> 00:34:08.218 position:5% line:89% align:start
[man] Did you just see that?

00:34:08.252 --> 00:34:10.354 position:5% line:83% align:start
The baby suddenly
vanished into thin air

00:34:10.387 --> 00:34:12.623 position:5% line:83% align:start
and then mysteriously
reappeared again.

00:34:12.656 --> 00:34:15.059 position:5% line:83% align:start
I wonder why something
like that would happen?

00:34:15.092 --> 00:34:19.129 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe it means that the Mirai
from the future and Baby Mirai

00:34:19.163 --> 00:34:21.566 position:5% line:83% align:start
can't exist at the same time
and in the same place.

00:34:21.599 --> 00:34:24.902 position:7% line:83% align:start
Wait a second. If you wanna
question mysterious existences,

00:34:24.935 --> 00:34:26.538 position:21% line:83% align:start
why don't you take
a look in the mirror?

00:34:26.571 --> 00:34:28.606 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm not the one who's a dog
who looks like a human.

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.909 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Yukko] Well, I think
it's normal.

[sighs]

00:34:32.444 --> 00:34:34.312 position:27% line:83% align:start
We're wasting
our time arguing.

00:34:34.913 --> 00:34:37.015 position:13% line:83% align:start
We have to figure out a way
to get those dolls

00:34:37.048 --> 00:34:38.484 position:21% line:89% align:start
back into their box,

00:34:38.517 --> 00:34:40.219 position:10% line:83% align:start
and we're gonna have to work
together to pull it off.

00:34:40.619 --> 00:34:42.888 position:16% line:71% align:start
Huh?
That means you'll
have to help too.

00:34:42.922 --> 00:34:44.223 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, right.

00:34:44.256 --> 00:34:46.292 position:19% line:83% align:start
Big Brother,
your job's to distract Dad.

[nervously chuckling]

00:34:51.231 --> 00:34:52.499 position:5% line:89% align:start
What is it?

00:34:52.532 --> 00:34:56.370 position:41% line:83% align:start
Before that, can we
play the bee game?

00:34:56.403 --> 00:34:57.404 position:16% line:89% align:start
Again?

Yeah?

[Kun] I, um, uh, well.

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:30.172 position:38% line:83% align:start
[father] What is it?
What's the matter?

00:35:30.205 --> 00:35:31.407 position:41% line:89% align:start
Pretty.

[father] What's the matter?

00:35:32.975 --> 00:35:34.344 position:38% line:89% align:start
[Kun] Well, I just--

00:35:34.377 --> 00:35:36.212 position:27% line:83% align:start
What's wrong?
Do you have to go potty?

00:35:36.246 --> 00:35:38.081 position:44% line:89% align:start
No, that's not it.

00:35:38.114 --> 00:35:39.416 position:38% line:83% align:start
[father] You hungry?
You want a snack?

[Yukko] Okay.
[Kun] No?

[Yukko] And this one too.

[Kun] No, not really.

00:35:44.454 --> 00:35:46.156 position:24% line:89% align:start
[father] Kun, what is it?

00:35:46.189 --> 00:35:47.591 position:24% line:89% align:start
What are you doing?

00:35:47.625 --> 00:35:50.694 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't disassemble the dolls
out in the open, no!

00:35:52.129 --> 00:35:53.297 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sorry!

There's no time
to put it back!

I have to go!

You gotta go?

[father] Of course you can!
Of course you can!

[Mirai] The emperor's baton!

What do we do?

Because it's not funny.

I was the one who put all

Oh, what'd the two of you do?

Oh, you did?

After that, we played

[Kun] Where am I?

00:41:41.769 --> 00:41:43.939 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Yumi] You're right there,
there in my tummy.

00:41:44.572 --> 00:41:46.008 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Kun] What kind of baby was I?

00:41:46.041 --> 00:41:48.610 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Yumi] Hmm, you were
pretty much like Mirai is now.

00:41:48.644 --> 00:41:50.445 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Kun] But I don't like Mirai.

00:41:50.479 --> 00:41:53.549 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Yumi] Oh, you don't mean that.
Don't say that.

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:56.119 position:10% line:89% align:start
Now who do you think this is?

00:41:56.152 --> 00:41:58.021 position:24% line:71% align:start
[Kun gasps]
It's you, isn't it?
[Yumi] Mm-hmm.

00:41:58.054 --> 00:42:00.589 position:19% line:77% align:start
[Kun] You're so pretty.
[Yumi] Oh, thank you.

00:42:00.623 --> 00:42:01.758 position:30% line:5% align:start
You were skinnier then.

00:42:01.791 --> 00:42:03.526 position:21% line:5% align:start
Hey, watch it, buddy.

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:05.929 position:10% line:5% align:start
There's more photos in here.

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:09.966 position:24% line:83% align:start
This one was when
I first met Daddy.

00:42:10.533 --> 00:42:12.669 position:7% line:89% align:start
And this was from my first job.

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:16.540 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's college graduation,
high school.

00:42:16.907 --> 00:42:20.811 position:10% line:83% align:start
Middle school.
Oh, it makes me feel so old.

00:42:20.845 --> 00:42:23.814 position:19% line:83% align:start
Elementary school,
I had so much fun then.

00:42:23.848 --> 00:42:27.418 position:16% line:83% align:start
First grade.
Oh, look, that's Yoichi.

00:42:27.451 --> 00:42:29.520 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Kun] Yoichi? Who's Yoichi?

00:42:29.553 --> 00:42:31.990 position:16% line:77% align:start
[Yumi] He's Mommy's
little brother. We went
to his wedding, remember?

00:42:32.023 --> 00:42:33.859 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Kun] Did you guys get along?

00:42:33.892 --> 00:42:35.794 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Yumi] Yeah, of course we did.
We're only a year apart

00:42:35.827 --> 00:42:37.896 position:19% line:83% align:start
so we were practically
like twins.

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:39.664 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Kun] You had a cat?

00:42:39.698 --> 00:42:41.600 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Yumi] It's not real,
it's just a toy.

00:42:41.633 --> 00:42:43.870 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was a birthday present
from Great-Granny.

00:42:44.637 --> 00:42:46.472 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, I wanna get a present!

00:42:46.505 --> 00:42:47.640 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh? What for?

00:42:47.673 --> 00:42:49.842 position:33% line:89% align:start
Um... for my birthday?

00:42:49.876 --> 00:42:51.978 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's not your birthday
for a long while.

00:42:52.745 --> 00:42:53.947 position:47% line:89% align:start
I want a bicycle.

00:42:53.981 --> 00:42:55.681 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yumi] Well, we can
talk about that later.

00:42:55.715 --> 00:42:57.718 position:35% line:89% align:start
But I want a bicycle.

00:42:57.751 --> 00:42:58.952 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:42:59.786 --> 00:43:03.056 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, seriously, man.

00:43:04.925 --> 00:43:07.461 position:19% line:83% align:start
I just cleaned up too,
what a mess.

00:43:07.961 --> 00:43:09.529 position:47% line:83% align:start
I want it to be
this color.

00:43:09.563 --> 00:43:12.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
Granny's coming over so you
need to pick up your toys.

00:43:12.166 --> 00:43:13.433 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm not done playing.

00:43:13.467 --> 00:43:14.669 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do as you're told, Kun.

00:43:14.702 --> 00:43:16.137 position:24% line:89% align:start
Dad can help me clean up.

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:17.872 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, Daddy is not home today.

00:43:17.906 --> 00:43:19.607 position:21% line:89% align:start
I can't do it without him.

00:43:19.641 --> 00:43:22.543 position:5% line:77% align:start
Well, fine!
Then I'm just gonna
have to throw them all away.

00:43:22.577 --> 00:43:23.878 position:30% line:89% align:start
You can't do that!

00:43:23.913 --> 00:43:25.948 position:5% line:83% align:start
And I'm never gonna buy you
another new toy again.

00:43:25.981 --> 00:43:28.449 position:33% line:89% align:start
No, Mom! Please don't!

00:43:28.483 --> 00:43:29.752 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then pick up your toys.

00:43:29.785 --> 00:43:33.122 position:47% line:83% align:start
I don't wanna!
[crying]

00:43:35.557 --> 00:43:37.893 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why is it always like this?

00:43:37.928 --> 00:43:39.029 position:33% line:89% align:start
This is Mirai's fault!

00:43:39.062 --> 00:43:40.897 position:19% line:77% align:start
[gasps]
I hate her!

00:43:40.931 --> 00:43:42.766 position:5% line:83% align:start
What, no! What are you doing?
You can't hit her, she's a baby!

00:43:42.799 --> 00:43:44.734 position:27% line:89% align:start
[doorbell rings]

00:43:44.768 --> 00:43:47.070 position:5% line:77% align:start
Great, now Grandma's here.
[Yukko barking]

00:43:57.014 --> 00:43:59.183 position:47% line:83% align:start
Mommy will be
right back, okay?

00:44:00.217 --> 00:44:02.853 position:24% line:77% align:start
[doorbell ringing]
Yeah, I'm coming!

00:44:02.887 --> 00:44:04.755 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll be right there!

00:44:07.658 --> 00:44:09.027 position:41% line:89% align:start
[yells]

00:44:28.047 --> 00:44:31.084 position:10% line:89% align:start
She's a witch! Mom's a witch!

00:44:31.551 --> 00:44:33.953 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why is she so mean? I hate her!

00:44:36.789 --> 00:44:38.524 position:33% line:77% align:start

[gasps]

00:45:15.965 --> 00:45:18.168 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Mirai] You really
should be nicer to her.

00:45:19.735 --> 00:45:21.238 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Kun] Future Mirai.

00:45:21.271 --> 00:45:22.638 position:27% line:89% align:start
You did it again.

00:45:22.671 --> 00:45:24.107 position:19% line:83% align:start
You tried to hit me
with your bullet train

00:45:24.141 --> 00:45:25.776 position:27% line:83% align:start
even after Mom
told you not to.

00:45:25.809 --> 00:45:27.611 position:10% line:89% align:start
But it wasn't a bullet train.

00:45:27.644 --> 00:45:30.647 position:10% line:83% align:start
You aren't supposed to use
a bullet train to hit people.

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:32.083 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Kun] It was a Super Azusa.

00:45:32.116 --> 00:45:34.285 position:7% line:89% align:start
I don't care what kind it was!

00:45:35.353 --> 00:45:38.723 position:5% line:83% align:start
And why can't you be
a little nicer to Mom?

00:45:38.756 --> 00:45:40.191 position:52% line:83% align:start
I don't know,
I just can't.

00:45:40.224 --> 00:45:42.960 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's her one day off from work,
she doesn't get many

00:45:42.994 --> 00:45:45.330 position:5% line:83% align:start
and she has to spend it
fighting with you.

00:45:47.399 --> 00:45:49.068 position:7% line:89% align:start
Come on, try.

00:45:49.101 --> 00:45:51.370 position:35% line:89% align:start
I know, I'm not cute.

00:45:51.403 --> 00:45:52.337 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:45:54.039 --> 00:45:57.576 position:24% line:83% align:start
Both Baby Mirai and Yukko
are really cute.

00:45:59.078 --> 00:46:02.315 position:21% line:83% align:start
Not me, I know
I'm not that cute anymore.

00:46:03.183 --> 00:46:06.286 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh... uh.

00:46:07.187 --> 00:46:10.323 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, come on. That's not true,
you're very cute.

00:46:11.191 --> 00:46:12.158 position:41% line:89% align:start
No, I'm not.

00:46:12.192 --> 00:46:14.627 position:44% line:83% align:start
You're the cutest!
Adorable!

00:46:17.398 --> 00:46:18.999 position:35% line:89% align:start
Come back!

00:46:20.968 --> 00:46:22.803 position:61% line:89% align:start
Big Brother!

00:46:25.206 --> 00:46:27.275 position:38% line:89% align:start

[girl crying]
Huh?

00:47:32.811 --> 00:47:34.446 position:30% line:89% align:start
What are you sad about?

00:47:39.151 --> 00:47:42.155 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's okay, don't cry.

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:51.798 position:33% line:89% align:start
Thanks a lot.

00:47:51.831 --> 00:47:53.300 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're really nice.

00:47:54.768 --> 00:47:58.139 position:19% line:83% align:start
But to tell the truth,
I wasn't really crying.

00:47:59.207 --> 00:48:01.776 position:13% line:83% align:start
I just wanted to make sure
I was feeling sad enough

00:48:01.809 --> 00:48:02.977 position:21% line:89% align:start
to write this letter.

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:04.412 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:48:06.314 --> 00:48:07.248 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:48:33.042 --> 00:48:34.410 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Kun] What's the letter for?

00:48:34.444 --> 00:48:36.980 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Yumi] Dearest Grandma,
I really would like

00:48:37.013 --> 00:48:39.048 position:47% line:83% align:start
to have a cat
so please let me.

00:48:39.082 --> 00:48:40.484 position:61% line:89% align:start
[Kun] A cat?

00:48:40.517 --> 00:48:43.220 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Yumi] I don't know why,
but animals love me.

00:48:43.254 --> 00:48:45.923 position:10% line:89% align:start
Every animal I meet loves me.

00:48:45.956 --> 00:48:50.060 position:5% line:83% align:start
But my grandma, she's allergic
so she said I couldn't have one.

00:48:50.094 --> 00:48:52.464 position:5% line:83% align:start
She said I could have
an outdoor pet,

00:48:52.497 --> 00:48:55.567 position:5% line:83% align:start
but it's not a real pet
if it's always outside,

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:58.403 position:5% line:83% align:start
so I'm going to write her
a letter every single day

00:48:58.436 --> 00:48:59.504 position:5% line:89% align:start
until she says yes.

00:48:59.537 --> 00:49:03.241 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can be pretty convincing,
so I think she'll let me.

00:49:04.976 --> 00:49:07.112 position:35% line:89% align:start
[growling]

00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:12.585 position:21% line:83% align:start
Here kitty, come on.
No need to be scared.

00:49:12.618 --> 00:49:14.086 position:19% line:89% align:start
I wanna be your friend.

Do you have any
brothers or sisters?

00:49:28.001 --> 00:49:29.202 position:61% line:5% align:start
[Kun] Yeah.
[Yumi] Which?

00:49:29.236 --> 00:49:30.504 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Kun] A little sister.

00:49:30.537 --> 00:49:33.307 position:30% line:83% align:start
I have a little brother
but he's so weak

00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:37.278 position:10% line:83% align:start
and such a crybaby,
always crying over everything

00:49:37.312 --> 00:49:40.914 position:7% line:83% align:start
and 'cause of that my mom
loves me more than my brother.

00:49:40.948 --> 00:49:44.252 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even if my grandma says no,
I have a feeling that my mom

00:49:44.285 --> 00:49:46.421 position:5% line:83% align:start
will eventually
let me have a cat.

[sighs]

00:49:50.326 --> 00:49:53.295 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess I should be glad
my brother's a crybaby.

Won't you get in trouble
for doing that?

00:50:25.563 --> 00:50:28.866 position:30% line:83% align:start
Probably, but it's

[Kun] You might
get scolded.

00:50:54.527 --> 00:50:58.097 position:13% line:83% align:start

I was convinced you
loved me more than Yoichi?

Now, I know exactly how
a little troublemaker

can worm their way
into your heart.

00:53:41.906 --> 00:53:44.776 position:5% line:83% align:start
You were definitely
a handful as a child.

00:53:44.809 --> 00:53:47.779 position:5% line:83% align:start
So mischievous
and impossibly stubborn.

00:53:47.812 --> 00:53:51.182 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was constantly losing

Huh, is that true?

I actually started
doing any cleaning

00:53:57.423 --> 00:53:58.891 position:21% line:89% align:start
until after I got married.

Unbelievable.

00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:05.732 position:13% line:89% align:start
I love my job, I really do,

I think you just answered
your own question.

00:54:27.555 --> 00:54:31.125 position:13% line:83% align:start
Raising kids is
all about good intentions.

That's right.

01:00:18.696 --> 01:00:20.165 position:13% line:89% align:start

Hmm?

[Kun] Does it hurt?

01:00:50.131 --> 01:00:52.833 position:24% line:83% align:start
What, this?
It's from the war.

01:00:52.867 --> 01:00:54.301 position:13% line:89% align:start
The ship I was on capsized

01:00:54.335 --> 01:00:57.004 position:10% line:83% align:start
and my leg got injured
when it happened, that's all.

01:00:57.838 --> 01:00:59.874 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's funny,
it used to bother me

01:00:59.907 --> 01:01:02.110 position:24% line:83% align:start
but I hardly even
notice it anymore.

Hey, it's okay.

Uh, your first time what?

01:01:26.769 --> 01:01:28.004 position:5% line:89% align:start
The horse?

Your first?

01:01:30.274 --> 01:01:31.908 position:13% line:89% align:start

We are.

[man] Can you
tack up my horse?

01:01:41.386 --> 01:01:43.987 position:24% line:77% align:start
Sure, no problem.
Yeah, we'll do it right away.

01:01:45.923 --> 01:01:47.791 position:41% line:83% align:start
Thanks,
I got it from here.

Good girl.

01:01:53.364 --> 01:01:54.799 position:38% line:89% align:start
So cool!

[soft music playing]

A little.

01:02:36.477 --> 01:02:38.880 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why don't you try looking ahead?

01:02:38.913 --> 01:02:40.948 position:21% line:83% align:start
Just don't look down
at the ground,

no matter how much
you may want to.

The trick to riding is
the same for everything.

01:04:57.995 --> 01:05:01.365 position:10% line:83% align:start
Once you learn how,
you can ride anything at all.

[Yumi] That's right.

01:09:27.684 --> 01:09:30.453 position:5% line:83% align:start
He built engines
for fighter planes.

01:09:30.486 --> 01:09:33.489 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then later during the war
he was drafted,

and the ship that he was on
was attacked.

He got badly injured
but he survived.

Then, after the war, he got
a job at a motorcycle company.

01:28:10.084 --> 01:28:13.486 position:16% line:83% align:start
if Great-Grandpa didn't swim
as hard as he could,

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:14.822 position:33% line:89% align:start
and then Great-Granny,

01:28:14.855 --> 01:28:17.725 position:16% line:83% align:start
if she didn't decide
to lose the race on purpose,

01:28:17.758 --> 01:28:19.794 position:41% line:83% align:start
none of us would be
here right now.

01:28:21.362 --> 01:28:23.731 position:41% line:83% align:start
These little things
all come together

01:28:23.764 --> 01:28:25.766 position:47% line:83% align:start
to make up
who we are today.

01:28:26.567 --> 01:28:30.071 position:21% line:83% align:start
Everyone in our family is
a result of these moments.

01:28:31.372 --> 01:28:32.774 position:35% line:89% align:start
We are?

01:28:33.909 --> 01:28:36.812 position:35% line:89% align:start
[whooshes]

01:29:02.573 --> 01:29:03.941 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, Kun.

01:29:05.542 --> 01:29:07.946 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think Mom and Dad
are looking for you.

01:29:09.446 --> 01:29:10.915 position:55% line:89% align:start
Don't do that.

01:29:10.949 --> 01:29:11.983 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do what?

01:29:12.016 --> 01:29:15.453 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't be barbaric,
sit down at the dining table.

01:29:15.486 --> 01:29:16.554 position:10% line:89% align:start
Do you want some?

01:29:16.588 --> 01:29:17.922 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, thanks.

01:29:23.561 --> 01:29:26.165 position:19% line:89% align:start
Mirai from the future?

01:29:26.198 --> 01:29:29.134 position:13% line:83% align:start
Mm-mmm. Actually,
this is me in the present.

01:29:29.168 --> 01:29:31.971 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're the one who's
from the past right now.

01:29:32.004 --> 01:29:33.706 position:27% line:89% align:start
In other words...

01:29:34.907 --> 01:29:37.610 position:19% line:83% align:start
That guy just now,
do you know who he is?

01:29:37.643 --> 01:29:38.945 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

01:29:39.746 --> 01:29:41.615 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Mirai] Pretty cool, huh?

01:29:42.514 --> 01:29:44.684 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's time for you
to go home

01:29:44.718 --> 01:29:46.953 position:24% line:83% align:start
and try not
to get lost, okay?

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:48.788 position:27% line:89% align:start
Is this goodbye?

01:29:48.822 --> 01:29:50.724 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't be silly.

01:29:50.757 --> 01:29:54.028 position:13% line:77% align:start
Now you had better
get going before you start
getting sick of me.

01:29:54.061 --> 01:29:56.030 position:35% line:89% align:start
[whooshes]

01:30:37.507 --> 01:30:39.743 position:10% line:83% align:start
[father] How's your headache,
is it gone?

01:30:39.777 --> 01:30:41.145 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Yumi] Finally, thank God.

01:30:41.178 --> 01:30:43.647 position:19% line:83% align:start
[father] You gotta
take care of yourself, too.

01:30:45.516 --> 01:30:48.018 position:33% line:83% align:start
I appreciate how sweet
you've been lately.

01:30:48.053 --> 01:30:49.154 position:16% line:89% align:start
Who, me?

01:30:49.187 --> 01:30:51.522 position:30% line:83% align:start
You never were
this thoughtful before.

01:30:51.555 --> 01:30:52.589 position:19% line:89% align:start
Like when?

01:30:52.623 --> 01:30:55.026 position:27% line:89% align:start
Like, when Kun was born.

01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:56.061 position:16% line:89% align:start
[father] Yeah.

01:30:56.094 --> 01:30:58.263 position:30% line:83% align:start
Working and being a dad
was too much for you.

01:30:58.296 --> 01:30:59.931 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, and it wasn't for you?

01:30:59.965 --> 01:31:02.567 position:19% line:89% align:start
Me? I'm the same as always.

01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:03.935 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're unflappable now.

01:31:03.970 --> 01:31:05.071 position:50% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:31:05.104 --> 01:31:09.141 position:5% line:83% align:start
I get it, it was tough,
but you were just always angry.

01:31:09.175 --> 01:31:12.979 position:10% line:83% align:start
[sighs] You're right,
I'd blocked it out of my mind.

01:31:13.012 --> 01:31:16.048 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I think we did
a decent job, didn't we?

01:31:16.082 --> 01:31:19.119 position:24% line:83% align:start
Truth is we really owe it
to our kids.

01:31:25.058 --> 01:31:28.061 position:5% line:83% align:start
[father] So, do you think
I'm a good dad now?

01:31:28.695 --> 01:31:30.931 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Yumi] I'd say you're okay.

01:31:30.964 --> 01:31:32.200 position:5% line:89% align:start
[father] Just okay?

01:31:32.233 --> 01:31:33.935 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Yumi] What about me,
am I a good mom?

01:31:33.968 --> 01:31:36.270 position:5% line:83% align:start
Really good.
Not perfect, but who is?

01:31:36.304 --> 01:31:38.006 position:41% line:83% align:start
You know what,
I'm okay with that,

01:31:38.039 --> 01:31:40.041 position:44% line:83% align:start
as long as I'm not
a bad mom.

01:31:40.842 --> 01:31:42.844 position:55% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

01:31:42.877 --> 01:31:46.115 position:5% line:89% align:start
[both laughing]

01:31:49.784 --> 01:31:51.987 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Yukko] And I'm a good dog.

01:31:56.091 --> 01:31:57.726 position:16% line:89% align:start
[babbles]

01:32:06.236 --> 01:32:07.871 position:41% line:89% align:start
You want some?

01:32:11.741 --> 01:32:13.043 position:44% line:89% align:start
Here you go.

01:32:26.123 --> 01:32:29.727 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yumi] Mirai, Kun, sweetie.
Come on, we're ready!

01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:31.695 position:5% line:77% align:start
[father] Time to hit the road!
Okay!

01:32:31.729 --> 01:32:33.198 position:47% line:89% align:start
[Mirai cries out]

01:32:34.632 --> 01:32:35.634 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:32:35.867 --> 01:32:37.869 position:58% line:89% align:start
[screams]

01:32:55.422 --> 01:32:58.258 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

01:33:02.830 --> 01:33:05.165 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

01:33:08.135 --> 01:33:11.839 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Yumi] Come on, family.
Let's get this vacation started!

01:33:13.874 --> 01:33:16.344 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

01:33:21.950 --> 01:33:23.952 position:30% line:89% align:start
[whistle blows]

01:33:23.985 --> 01:33:26.788 position:30% line:89% align:start
[music playing]

01:33:26.821 --> 01:33:30.825 position:21% line:5% align:start
[singing in Japanese]

01:38:23.071 --> 01:38:25.207 position:27% line:89% align:start
[music fades out]
