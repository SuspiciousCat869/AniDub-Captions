I brought along new combat items

These devices are
called Scouters.

You’ll find they’re far
more compact and powerful

They also function
as communicators.

The displays should be familiar.

Yes, of course, Your Majesty.

You see, we found that
his latent abilities

his power level actually
far exceeded your son’s.

[MOROKO gasps]
Upon further inspection,

99
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,888
his rating is less than
half of his original number.

100
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:35,397
We’ve had a handful of anomalous
readings in the nursery lately.

101
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,898
His must have been due
to a device malfunction.

102
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:41,071
That being said, even if we
do ignore the previous data,

103
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,822
Broly’s latent abilities
are quite remarkable.

And once he receives training,

he will grow to be an
outstanding warrior.

He’ll be a powerful
asset to our forces.

He could even end up being

for barging in.

I... understand you plan
to send Broly away.

115
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:14,808
I’m told his pod will be
destined for an outlying world.

116
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,315
[KING VEGETA]
That’s correct.

117
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,596
[PARAGUS] That’s a fate meant
for a lower‐class warrior.

118
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,520
<i>Not</i> my son.

119
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,226
On the contrary,
what better way is there

120
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:24,686
to prove that your son
is a truly powerful warrior

121
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,158
than by conquering an unclaimed
planet on his own?

122
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,870
After all, that’s what
Saiyans have always done.

123
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,330
We subjugate valuable worlds and
sell them to the highest bidder.

124
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,463
[PARAGUS] But his destination
is the planetoid Vampa.

125
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:41,709
It’s an inhospitable world
devoid of intelligent life.

126
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:45,345
I don’t see how we could make
much of a profit on it.

127
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,175
The truth of the matter
is that your son Broly’s

128
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,970
latent abilities are
abnormally elevated.

129
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,144
I’d go so far as
to call him a freak.

130
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,854
Someday, that power
will likely end up

131
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,636
driving him completely insane.

132
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,858
When that time comes,
he’ll be a danger

133
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,861
not just to the planet Vegeta,
but the entire universe.

134
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,525
[KING VEGETA]
Be grateful that I’m exiling him

135

to a faraway world and not
simply ending his life.

No. This isn’t right.

You... You’re jealous!

139
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:19,964
Because Broly’s latent abilities
surpass that of the prince’s,

don’t they? You’re trying
to exile my son!

I will have your tongue.

Then kill the both of you.

before you got here.

Please. We have to go back.

153

[PARAGUS] I can’t do that.
I have to save my son.

154
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,587
King Vegeta has
always been too proud

155
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,263
of his child’s exceptional
latent abilities.

that my son is almost

314
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:43,748
there’s no reason we need
to pick them up together.

315
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,336
I’ve got a bad
feeling about this.

316
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,133
None of it makes any sense.

317
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,015
[LEEK]
Come on.

318
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,051
What do you mean
a "bad feeling"?

319
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,756
[BARDOCK]
Look. We conquer planets

320
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:52,894
and then sell them
to whoever will pay us.

321
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,352
That’s how the Saiyans
made our fortunes,

322
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:57,472
how we’ve always existed.

323
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,018
But then... Frieza’s
father, King Cold,

324
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,692
made us serve under him,
forcing our people into slavery.

325
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,033
Reaping the benefits
of our work.

326
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,858
[LEEK] That was a pretty
long time ago, though.

327
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,205
[BARDOCK]
Sure, but all this time

328
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,409
we’ve never been happy
working together, have we?

329
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,701
[LEEK]
That’s true.

330
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:16,912
I can’t think of any
Saiyan who likes Frieza.

331
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,248
Yeah, and I’m betting
he probably feels

332
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,292
the same way about us.

333
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,714
[LEEK]
What?

334
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,923
[BARDOCK] The Frieza Force
has grown extremely large.

335
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,245
They could probably
get by even without us

336
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,760
annoying Saiyans around.

337
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,182
[door hisses]

338
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,013
[LEEK]
Wait. Hold on.

339
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,636
You’re not suggesting
that Frieza’s

340
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,892
planning to exterminate us.

341
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,225
It’s a possibility. Am I right?

342
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:46,941
Uh... Come on,
quit playing, Bardock.

343
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,738
[TARO]
Yo. It’s good to see ya.

344
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:51,951
Didn’t think you’d
make it back alive.

345
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,111
Shut up.

346
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,080
Any idea why we got the order
to return home so fast?

347
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,791
It beats me. Maybe they
found a fortified world

348
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,832
they need all of our help with.

349
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,134
One so protected, it’ll take
every Saiyan alive to conquer.

350
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,211
That must be it! And here
you had me all worried!

351
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,175
Oh, and Bardock.

352
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,015
Frieza’s people have
been askin’ around

353
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,470
about the Super Saiyan lately.
Not sure what that’s about.

354
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,935
What do you mean
the "Super Saiyan"?

355
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,684
Like the one in the legend?

356
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,226
That’s it!

357
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,851
[KIKONO]
Regarding the Super Saiyan...

358
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,018
A‐And the Super Saiyan God.

359
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,107
We’ve researched
them extensively,

360
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,742
but they appear
to be only myths.

361
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,860
[FRIEZA]
Ah, wonderful.

362
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,276
I expected as much.

363
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:38,906
But I can’t afford the least
bit of anxiety right now,

364
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,833
so I had to be sure.
Not that they’d be a problem.

365
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,414
So, then. Are you
cancelling the attack?

366
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:48,458
[laughing] You are hilarious!

367
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:49,796
Not after I went
through the trouble

368
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,839
of assembling all these monkeys.

369
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,625
It’s a perfect plan to
get rid of the Saiyans.

370
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,470
Planet and all.

371
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,304
Wouldn’t you agree?

372
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:00,892
[SAIYAN A]
Welcome home.

373
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:01,723
Good to see ya, Bardock!

374
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,427
[BARDOCK]
You too.

375
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,687
What’s wrong?
No warm welcome, Gine?

376
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,984
Bardock, you’re here!

377
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,816
Things sure are crazy
around town today.

378
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,653
Yeah. It’s not that often
everyone comes back.

379
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:16,778
[BARDOCK]
Where’s Raditz?

380
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:17,994
Off world. He’s in
the military now,

381
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:21,084
teamed up with Prince Vegeta
on some planet.

382
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,660
I seriously doubt they’ll
make it back for this.

383
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,168
Wow, Prince Vegeta, huh?

384
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,790
I wouldn’t wanna be stuck
on a ship with that one.

385
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,667
How is Kakarot doing?

386
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,884
Is he still in
a nursing capsule?

387
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,506
He is. It’s just about time
to let him out, though.

388
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,893
You should see him. Come on.

389
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,890
[BARDOCK]
Still small, huh?

390
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,186
[GINE] I think he may
be a late bloomer.

391
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,600
He looks just like you,
though, don’t you think?

392
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,358
He certainly has his father’s
hair, for better or worse.

393
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:52,902
[GINE laughs]

394
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,704
[BARDOCK] After dark, I’m going
to steal a pod for him.

395
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,201
[GINE]
Huh?

396
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,582
[BARDOCK] We’re going to send
our son to another world.

397
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,951
Huh?! You’ve gotta be kidding!

398
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,536
Gine. I’m serious.

399
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:09,211
Have you gone insane? Why would
we abandon our son like that?

400
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,381
He hasn’t even learned
how to talk yet!

401
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,800
With his latent abilities,
he’s destined to be sent away.

402
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,880
Probably somewhere horrible.

403
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,377
So, we’re going
to see to it that

404
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,047
he at least grows up
on a decent planet.

405
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:24,807
No. He’s far too young for that.

406
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,980
I don’t think we can afford
to wait much longer.

407
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,639
And what does that mean?!

408
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,558
Because of Frieza.

409
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,268
I think that he’s afraid of
the legendary Super Saiyan

410
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,729
appearing one day.

411
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,489
Hold on, the Super Saiyan?

412
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,069
But, that’s only...

413
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,665
That’s just a children’s
fairy tale, Bardock!

414
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,241
I know.

415
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,247
The problem is, I think he’s
still bothered by the legend.

416
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,158
And I can’t imagine he’d
want to take any chances.

417
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,577
[gasps]

418
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:55,416
I get the feeling that death
is on its way for us.

Is there another option?

421
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,142
Let’s think about this.

422
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,102
[BARDOCK]
No, it’s the only choice.

423
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:08,642
If I turn out to be wrong,
I’ll go and rescue him.

In that case,
why don’t the three of us

426
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:13,483
run off somewhere together?

427
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,016
We can’t. They’d use
their damn Scouters

428
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,358
and be able to track
us down in no time.

00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,903
Bardock...

430
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,357
Why are you going through
so much trouble?

431
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,488
It’s not like a Saiyan man
to worry about his children.

432
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,038
So what’s gotten into you?

433
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,949
[BARDOCK]
I don’t know.

434
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,999
Maybe it’s because I’m
constantly fighting, destroying.

435
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:36,134
And I’d actually like to
save something for once.

436
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,962
Especially someone
who was judged to be

437
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,007
a lower‐class warrior.

438
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,432
Like my Kakarot.

439
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:46,309
[GOKU cries]

440
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,310
[BARDOCK] I’ve programmed this
to head to a distant planet

441
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:52,102
called Earth. The people on
that world have low power levels

442
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,936
and aren’t
technologically advanced.

443
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,692
I think he’ll be able
to do well there, Gine.

444
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,187
Good thing is, it’s not an
extremely valuable world,

445
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,909
so I’m hoping it won’t even show
up on the Frieza Force’s radar.

446
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,069
If your father is wrong
about this then

we’ll come and
get you immediately.

He specifically used people
with lower battle powers

What kind of wish could he
be after at this point?

He can’t wish for anything
outside of Shenron’s power,

Well, count me out.

629
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:24,879
Yay! Here.

630
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,678
[laughs]

631
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
[BULMA]
Thanks, Uncle Beerus!

632
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,426
Goodbye. Don’t have
too much fun!

633
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:35,886
Hey! I’m a Destroyer God,
not a babysitter!

634
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:39,057
The temperature
on the ice continent

635
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,607
will be below freezing.

636
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,404
We’ll have to stop and buy
some cold‐weather gear.

637
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,108
Hey, Bulma, why were
you collecting

638
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,278
the Dragon Balls anyway?

639
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,817
[BULMA grumbles]

640
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,988
That’s none of your business.

641
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,367
Ah. Come on, tell us!

642
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,793
[BULMA grumbles]

643
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,253
[BULMA] I was gonna make
myself look younger, okay?

644
00:31:57,374 --> 00:32:00,134
Just by, like, five years.

645
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:03,172
You were gonna summon Shenron
just because you look so old?

646
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:04,595
You shut your mouth!

647
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:06,973
A Saiyan wouldn’t understand
how important this is!

648
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,932
[VEGETA grunts]

649
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,470
But why stop at only
five years, Bulma?

650
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,095
You could make it
an even decade.

651
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,981
Because that much of a change
would be totally obvious.

652
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:18,601
I know exactly what
people’d say.

653
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,937
"Oh, Bulma, what a surprise!

654
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,824
Your skin is so smooth,
not a line to be seen.

655
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,072
You look ten years younger.

656
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:29,283
Come on, spill it,
who’s your surgeon."

657
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,954
I won’t have it.

658
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,284
Oh, I understand.

659
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,869
You’ve already been using the
Dragon Balls for that, huh?

660
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,663
‐‐[GOKU laughs]
‐‐[BULMA growls]

661
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,920
[screaming]

662
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,127
[laughing]

663
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:46,304
[VEGETA grunts]

664
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,140
Heh.

665
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:02,613
[KIKONO]
Lord Frieza.

666
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,649
Not only did Vegeta’s wife
have the Dragon Radar,

667
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,364
she’d already collected
six of the Dragon Balls

668
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,236
which are now in our possession!

669
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,912
Our search team is currently
heading to the site

670
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,990
of the final ball, which should
be recovered very soon.

671
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,747
Well, that is truly
marvelous news, Kikono.

672
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,920
So... Should we fire
up the engines

673
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,129
and head toward Earth
to claim your treasure?

674
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,210
Not yet. We’ll wait until
the seventh Dragon Ball

675
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,837
is irreversibly ours.

676
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:31,224
It would be foolish to rush
there and arrive so early.

677
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:32,553
Even without Scouters,

678
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,007
the Saiyans would
be able to recognize

679
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,635
my high battle power as we
approached their planet.

680
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:40,853
Uh. Of course, my lord.

681
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,266
[FRIEZA]
And you’ve already written down

682
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,864
how to make the wish, correct?

683
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:46,689
[KIKONO] That’s right.
And in great detail.

684
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,535
Uh... By the way‐‐

685
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:49,822
Go on, out with it;
what is your concern?

686
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:54,033
[KIKONO] Oh, u‐uh,
nothing. I‐It’s just...

687
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:57,035
Since we’re so close to
gathering the Dragon Balls,

688
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,198
I was wondering if you’d
give me a hint about what

689
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:02,707
incredibly wise wish you’ll be
making once we’re on Earth.

690
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,711
Will it be to have
an immortal body

691
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,214
like you’ve mentioned
to us before?

692
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:07,876
[laughing]

693
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:09,213
No, no, that’s not it.

694
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,797
Huh?

695
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,473
I realized something when I
was trapped in Earth’s hell

696
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,763
hanging from a tree
unable to move.

697
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,308
Not being able to die
would likely result

698
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:21,520
in unending misery.

699
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,481
[KIKONO]
Then, perhaps, uh, I don’t know.

700
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:28,733
To never take damage again.

701
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,277
Or something?

702
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,152
[FRIEZA] Hm... Now why would I
want to make the game so boring?

703
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,157
Wrong again.

704
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,740
Um...

705
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,237
So what could you want?

706
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:42,747
[laughing] You’ll never
be able to guess.

707
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,331
Oh, but I can.

708
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,286
You’re going to wish to
grow taller, aren’t you?

709
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,248
[FRIEZA gasps]

710
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,916
[KIKONO]
Huh?! Uh! No. Berryblue, don’t!

711
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,167
You can’t say that to him!

712
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,587
There are so many
soldiers who’ve called

713
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:56,338
Lord Frieza a pipsqueak.

714
00:34:56,428 --> 00:35:00,258
Of course, our commander
eliminated all of them.

715
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,938
Very wisely deduced,
my subordinate.

716
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:05,599
That is indeed my wish.

717
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:08,019
Really? [gulps]

718
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,266
That was actually
the right answer?

719
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,398
I trust I won’t have to worry
about you telling anyone else.

720
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:16,275
Of course not, my lord.

721
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:19,116
What I want is...

722
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,500
...to increase my height
by five full centimeters.

723
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:27,001
Huh...? Please forgive me.

724
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,125
If that’s the case,
couldn’t you simply go back

725
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,840
to your second transformation?

726
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,632
Wouldn’t you be
sufficiently tall then?

727
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,127
Don’t be a fool.

728
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,836
I would like to be taller in
my normal form you ninny.

729
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,179
And of course, my golden one.

730
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,644
Obviously.

731
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:44,735
But why only five centimeters?

732
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,809
Any more than that
would be too noticeable.

733
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,306
Don’t you understand?!

734
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:50,859
[KIKONO]
Uh! Not entirely.

735
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,442
I want it to look like
I’m still growing.

736
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,316
That this is natural!

737
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:59,236
[KIKONO]
Yes. Of course...

738
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,374
...my lord.

739
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:08,786
[CHEELAI]
This is pointless,

740
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,285
there’s no one out here.

741
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:13,707
Not to mention there aren’t that
many people with a battle power

742
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,878
of over 1,000 to begin with.

743
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,177
Our orders are to recruit
as many warriors as we can

744
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,851
to rebuild the force,
and that means exploring places

745
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,179
in the far reaches of
the universe, like this.

746
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,095
[CHEELAI] What, the Frieza Force
isn’t big enough already?

747
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,183
[LEMO]
Yeah, well, Rumor has it

748
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,019
they weren’t fighting
hard enough,

749
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:31,654
so Lord Frieza killed
all of ’em to make a point.

750
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,151
[CHEELAI]
Tch.

751
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:36,693
[LEMO] So, Cheelai. Why did
you join the Frieza Force?

752
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,780
I stole a galactic
patrol spaceship

753
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:39,493
and this is how I’m
stayin’ a free woman.

754
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,702
Hey, no one’ll touch me

755
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:44,295
if they know I’m part
of the Frieza Force.

756
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,289
A shifty one, huh?

757
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,370
Aw, thanks.

758
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,325
You’ve been in the force most
of your life, right, Lemo?

759
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,877
You must’ve met Lord Frieza
in all that time.

760
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,342
[LEMO]
Eh, I’m not a soldier‐type,

761
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:56,381
so I’ve only ever seen him
on the video monitors.

762
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:58,006
I hear he’s tiny.

763
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:00,971
[LEMO grunts] Don’t ever
say anything like that again

764
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:05,312
if you wanna live.
He’s killed for far less.

765
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,140
Yeah, yeah, I got ya.

766
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,064
[LEMO]
He once melted a lieutenant

767
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,523
just because he had bad breath.

768
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,152
[CHEELAI] Well, if he’s putting
women and old men to work

769
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,940
Frieza must be hurting
pretty bad for new recruits.

770
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,726
[LEMO]
Who’re you calling old?

771
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:18,068
[beeping]

772
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:19,073
[CHEELAI]
What’s that?

773
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,244
[LEMO]
Hm... A distress signal.

774
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,912
And it looks like
an old frequency

775
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,241
the Frieza Force used to use.

776
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,787
[CHEELAI] It’s coming from
that world over there.

777
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,911
[LEMO] If we rescue them, maybe
we’ll end up getting a bonus!

778
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,209
[CHEELAI]
Ha! A big one.

779
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,921
[LEMO]
Exactly. Let’s get down there.

780
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,592
[PARAGUS panting]

781
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,755
Don’t see anyone.

782
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:42,933
[CHEELAI]
Let’s beat it.

783
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,261
Hold on. I’ll use my Scouter.

784
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,138
Don’t go!

785
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,484
Are you with the Frieza Force?

786
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:53,232
[PARAGUS groaning]

787
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,991
Hold on a sec. Is that a tail?

788
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,281
You don’t mean to
tell me we found

789
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,412
an actual Saiyan way out here.

790
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:05,239
Wait, seriously?

791
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:08,869
Yes. My name is Paragus.

792
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:09,953
I’m a member of
the Frieza Force.

793
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,078
So that distress
signal came from...?

794
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:15,965
That was me. My spaceship
was damaged years ago.

795
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:18,964
I’d almost given up hope

796
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,337
that we’d ever make it off
this cursed planet.

797
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:25,136
But finally, someone
has come for us.

798
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,721
[CHEELAI]
Battle power of 4,200?

799
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:28,806
Perfect!

800
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,180
[LEMO]
So, are you alone?

801
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:30,768
[PARAGUS]
No, there’s one other‐‐

802
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,690
[stomping]

803
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,941
[LEMO, CHEELAI gasping]

804
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,325
[LEMO, CHEELAI scream]

805
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,151
Broly!

806
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:56,424
Yes, yes. Very good, son.

807
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,171
This is Broly.

808
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:02,757
[gasps] Impossible!

809
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:03,881
[LEMO]
What’s wrong?

810
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,178
It’s‐‐ His battle
power is like...

811
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,222
...the scanner can’t
even measure it!

812
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,385
No way!

813
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:12,854
Can’t be right, these are
state‐of‐the‐art devices‐‐

814
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:15,186
Ha, ha! Hop in
the ship, friends,

815
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,020
Frieza’s gonna lose it
when he meets you two.

816
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:27,703
So, uh, what are you
called again, creeper?

817
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,202
I’m Broly.

818
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,866
You want one of these to eat?

819
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:37,286
They’re not bad! Try this one.

820
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:42,046
Hey, wait! At least let me
take off the wrapper first.

821
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,555
[sniffs]

822
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,435
[PARAGUS]
It’s food, son.

823
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,432
[CHEELAI gasps]

824
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,557
[laughing]

825
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:56,774
See, I told ya it was good.

826
00:39:56,895 --> 00:40:00,025
Wow, not even a "thanks"?

827
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:03,146
[PARAGUS]
Remember your manners, Broly.

828
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,864
Thank you very much.

829
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,364
I am grateful.

830
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:07,736
Why so formal?

831
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,282
Maybe just try a "thank you."

832
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,737
[gasps]

833
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,788
I thank you.

834
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,412
That’s close.

835
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:21,418
[BERRYBLUE] I’ve brought the men
in question, Lord Frieza.

836
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,254
Oh!

837
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,972
[FRIEZA]
How interesting.

838
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,260
Are you really Saiyans?

839
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,425
Yet that one doesn’t
appear to have a tail.

840
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,845
No, sir.

841
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,683
Whenever he transformed
into a Great Ape

842
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,648
he unfortunately lost all
control over his actions.

843
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,061
He became a danger
to himself, and to me,

844
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,148
which is why I chose
to cut off his tail.

845
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,275
And has this mighty
warrior lost his mind

846
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:48,281
and exploded since then?

847
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,664
[PARAGUS] Yes, sir.
But on the rarest occasions.

848
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,782
[FRIEZA] You’re saying
this could still happen?

849
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,287
You brought danger to my ship.

850
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,789
Please, there’s no need
to worry, I swear.

851
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:58,713
Were that to happen...

852
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,130
...I can control him using
this remote device,

853
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,790
which pumps a bolt of
electricity through his body.

854
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,000
It’s not a strong current,

855
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,839
but it allows me to rein
him in when he acts out.

856
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,765
[FRIEZA]
Fascinating.

857
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,219
And what is your name, Saiyan?

858
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:19,635
Please, sir, f‐forgive Broly.

859
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,098
[FRIEZA]
It would seem you still have

860
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,358
a tremendous amount of
untapped battle power.

861
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,073
I’ve trained the boy well,
and I’m certain he can be

862
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,992
of great use to you and
your troops, Lord Frieza.

863
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:33,323
This is indeed an
unexpected bounty.

864
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:36,199
Berryblue, please offer a
worthy reward to the two

865
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:40,287
who found these Saiyans
and brought them here.

866
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,826
‐‐[LEMO] It’s a fortune!
‐‐[CHEELAI] Whoa...

867
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,338
[CHEELAI, LEMO] Thank you
for your generosity, sir!

868
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,169
[FRIEZA] I’m told you were
trapped together on that awful,

869
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:52,838
barren planet for
quite some time.

870
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,257
[PARAGUS]
That’s correct.

871
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,805
And are you aware that your
home world, Planet Vegeta,

872
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:01,189
was regrettably destroyed
by an unexpected meteor?

873
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,230
Yes, sir. I’ve been briefed
on the fate of my planet.

874
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,775
But, if I may be blunt,
I do not mourn for it.

875
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,069
At all.

876
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:12,363
Is that because you
never got your revenge?

877
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:17,950
[FRIEZA] Paragus. Did you
know that King Vegeta’s son,

878
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:20,746
Vegeta the Fourth,
is still alive?

879
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,162
Flourishing, even.

880
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,958
His son? Prince Vegeta?

881
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:27,002
Of course he would survive!

882
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,046
Those arrogant
bastards must pay!

883
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,712
Their line should have ended.

884
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,678
[FRIEZA]
Please, allow me to lend a hand

885
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:36,349
and help your vengeance
come to pass.

886
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:38,559
Come Berryblue. Show these two

887
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,431
to their new quarters so
they may get tidied up.

888
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:44,228
They’ll need some new
battle uniforms, as well.

889
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:45,482
Yes, Lord.

890
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:49,976
[FRIEZA] Hm... I had not planned
on fighting the Saiyans

891
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:54,448
this time around. However...

892
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:58,742
...this is proving to be far
too interesting to pass up.

893
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:04,923
[laughing]

894

Hey‐o!

00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,211
You’re lookin’ much better.

897
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,085
Come and eat with us, guys.

898
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:14,172
Say, Broly. Where’s
your battle uniform?

899
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,338
[BROLY]
No good.

900
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,586
It’s hard to move in.

901
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,677
Eh, it’s not that bad
once you get used to it.

902
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,934
But, do what makes
you happy, I guess.

903
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,267
[CHEELAI] Ugh. You should
really ditch that fur

904
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,773
around your waist
though. It’s dirty.

905
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:28,226
And it’s stinks.

Okay, I get it, that gross pelt

911
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,284
is actually something
important to you.

912
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:42,158
The fur is... special.

913
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:45,786
Broly, we’re here
to eat, not speak.

914

Don’t waste your energy.

Seriously?

You won’t even let him talk?!

917
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,974
I’d appreciate it if you
minded your own business.

Say what?!

00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:49,854
[BROLY growls]

944
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,975
[BROLY yells]

945
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,110
[DAIGEN groaning]

946
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:59,915
[BROLY screaming]

947
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,361
[CHEELAI gasps]

948
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:06,077
[screaming]

949
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:09,207
[BROLY groans]

950
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,370
[CHEELAI]
Are you okay?

951
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,040
[CHEELAI]
You!

952
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:14,089
He’s your son!

953
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:17,012
How could you do that to him?!

954
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,089
[PARAGUS]
If I hadn’t stop him,

955
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:20,046
he might have killed
that buffoon.

956
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,594
That’s your fault.

957
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,889
You’re the one who
raised him to be this way!

958
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,351
We may be in your debt,

959
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:28,181
but you don’t know anything
about us, woman.

960
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:32,017
From now on, you don’t
come near my son.

961
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:36,733
[BERRYBLUE]
Excuse me, Paragus.

962
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:39,737
Lord Frieza would
like an audience.

963
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,740
It would be an honor‐‐
we’ll go to him right away.

964
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,155
Broly!

965
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:45,332
I’m afraid he only wishes
to speak to you.

966
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,579
Of course, yes,
if that’s what he wants.

967
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:52,833
Broly, I’ll be right back.
Stay here and shut up.

968
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:55,127
Used to think <i>my
</i> old man was a creep,

969
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:57,093
but <i>this</i> guy’s even worse.

970
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,091
[CHEELAI laughs]

971
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,762
What’s so funny?

972
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,085
Heh, heh. Ahh...?

973
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,597
Is that‐‐? You little thief.

974
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,390
Here’s what I think
about shock treatment.

975
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,437
By the way, thanks for
the help earlier.

976
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,953
[LEMO]
Yeah, I get it.

977
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:23,910
You must be thirsty.

978
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,490
Give it here.

979
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:30,747
This’ll be easier.

980
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:37,292
[BROLY]
What is this?

981
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,300
[CHEELAI]
Huh? Ordinary water.

982
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:44,801
You can’t expect me to believe
you’ve never had water before.

983
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:45,297
[CHEELAI]
Hm?

984
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:47,098
[LEMO gasping]

985
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,813
[exhales]

986
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:55,976
That was good "water."

987
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,570
[BROLY]
This is Ba’s ear.

988
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:04,031
Oh, you mean the fur
that I was asking about.

989
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:08,085
[BROLY] Me and Ba got
along well back home.

990
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,989
Ba was a big animal‐‐a giant.

991
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,907
And more fearsome than
most beasts on Vampa.

992
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:17,077
I named Ba after the sound the
creature would make sometimes.

993
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:18,998
It was scary when it got mad.

994
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,086
But I got over that.

995
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:25,132
And I started to train
by avoiding Ba’s teeth.

996
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,177
We became like friends.

997
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,511
We became like... good friends.

998
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:39,941
So this monster was the
first friend you ever made?

999
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:42,734
Yeah, but my dad didn’t
like that one bit.

1000
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,900
He said that being friends with
Ba wasn’t training, but playing.

1001
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,820
So then...

1002
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:53,157
...Dad shot Ba’s ear off with a
gun, making it angry with him.

1003
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,955
And me.

1004
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,289
After that,

1005
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:58,884
Ba was never the same again.

1006
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,249
That’s why I decided
to keep Ba’s ear.

1007
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:05,169
To remember when
we were friends.

1008
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,928
That’s more than I’ve ever
heard you speak, Broly.

1009
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:12,064
Yeah, and it happened to be
the most innocent story

1010
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,729
I’ve heard around here
in a long time.

1011
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:18,189
You can’t seriously be
that pure and naive.

1012
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,230
I’ll betcha you don’t even
like all that fighting

1013
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:22,864
your father makes you do, huh?

1014
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,031
[LEMO]
If I had to guess,

1015
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:27,241
I’d say Paragus saw you
had some real talent,

1016
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:30,571
then made you focus on becoming
a warrior against your will.

1017
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,159
[CHEELAI]
That man is no good.

1018
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,913
He only thinks of you as a
powerful weapon he can use,

1019
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,905
not as an actual person. Right?

1020
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:39,287
You’re just a tool he’ll
use to get his vengeance.

1021
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,247
Probably.

1022
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:43,917
I gotta say,
your old man is awful.

1023
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,796
You know, you don’t
have to do everything

1024
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:48,053
that guy tells you to do.

1025
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:52,182
It’s not right for you to
say bad things about him.

1026
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:53,933
He is my dad.

1027
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,306
[FRIEZA SOLDIER A] It should be
around here somewhere.

1028
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,819
[BOTH gasping]

1029
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,401
[FRIEZA SOLDIER A] You weakling.
Hurry and pull me up!

1030
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,315
I’m tryin’!

1031
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:11,236
The hell you been eatin’?

1032
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:13,163
[gasps]

1033
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:14,124
[FRIEZA SOLDIER A]
Huh?

1034
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,622
[FRIEZA SOLDIER A]
Right there! We’ve got it!

1035
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:22,294
[FRIEZA] The planet we’re
heading to is called Earth.

1036
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:25,166
We’ll find Vegeta and
the other Saiyan there.

1037
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:27,626
I would like to see
Broly’s power in action

1038
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:28,805
against these two.

1039
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,884
I assure you his strength
is remarkable,

1040
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,338
you won’t be disappointed.

1041
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:35,140
The prince will pay for
what his father did to us.

1042
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,852
I’ll make you an offer.

1043
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:40,984
You’re welcome to do whatever
you please with Prince Vegeta.

1044
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:44,823
But the other one, Goku, is mine
and mine alone to destroy.

1045
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,190
You and Broly will leave
his death up to me!

1046
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:49,988
You’re very well acquainted
with the desire for revenge,

1047
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:52,822
so you’ll understand that I want
Goku’s blood on my hands.

1048
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,828
[PARAGUS]
Huh? As you wish, sir.

1049
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,951
Lord Frieza! They’ve done it!

1050
00:49:58,037 --> 00:50:00,037
We’ve collected
the seven Dragon Balls!

1051
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:03,004
Oh! And with such
perfect timing!

1052
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:14,589
[BULMA]
Hm? [gasps]

1053
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,008
Look! Down there! Frieza’s men!

1054
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:20,178
Oh great. Have they already
beaten us to the last one?

1055
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:23,405
[FRIEZA SOLDIER B] That aircraft
looks like it could be trouble.

1056
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:27,691
You don’t suppose they’re those
Saiyans Kikono warned us about.

1057
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:28,535
[GOKU]
Heh, heh!

1058
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:32,279
Whoo! Now this is cold!

1059
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:34,363
[BULMA] You don’t seem
to be bothered by it, Whis.

1060
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:38,158
Ah, no, I find the vacuum
of space far chillier.

1061
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:41,908
[FRIEZA SOLDIER A]
Crap. Not good!

1062
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,789
The Scouter’s
readings have spiked!

1063
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,844
Come on stupid.
We’re gettin’ outta here.

1064
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:50,710
[ALL]
Hm?

1065
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,175
[SOLDIERS scream]

1066
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:58,597
You’re finished, guys.

1067
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,392
Open up and give us back
the Dragon Balls!

1068
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,940
What are we
supposed to do now?

1069
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:07,981
Isn’t it obvious? If we don’t
give ’em back, we’re goners!

1070
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,975
Just look at that death stare.

1071
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,397
[FRIEZA SOLDIER B] But, like,
if we do give them back,

1072
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,146
Lord Frieza will murder us.

1073
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:16,358
[FRIEZA SOLDIER A]
Oh, no! He’s on his way.

1074
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,710
[FRIEZA grunts]

1075
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:37,762
Well, here he comes.

1076
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,346
He always likes a big entrance.

1077
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:40,680
[VEGETA]
Hmm?

1078
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:41,684
What is that?

1079
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,475
It’s not Frieza,
that’s for sure.

1080
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:45,731
There’s someone else.

1081
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:48,231
And his power is crazy.

1082
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,915
[FRIEZA SOLIDERS scream]

1083
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:16,055
[VEGETA]
Hm?

1084
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,797
Kakarot, the two behind
him are Saiyans.

1085
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,268
[PARAGUS]
Huh?! That’s Vegeta.

1086
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:29,102
I’m sure of it.

1087
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,190
[PARAGUS]
He looks just like the king.

1088
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:38,658
[GOKU]
Frieza!

1089
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:39,991
What are you doing here?

1090
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:42,164
I’m positive you
already know.

1091
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:46,334
I’ll soon have a wish granted,
thanks to the Dragon Balls.

1092
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:49,208
[FRIEZA chuckles]

1093
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,843
[CHEELAI] Uh, what are those
glowing floaty things he’s got?

1094
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,050
Beats me. Looks like
they all know, though.

1095
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,343
Hey, you!

1096
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,844
Give us those Dragon Balls
back and leave right now!

1097
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:02,048
It appears we may have
a larger problem.

1098
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,599
Huh?

1099
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:07,681
You might call it the blessing
and the curse of a warrior race.

1100
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:08,940
[GOKU]
So who are those two?

1101
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,349
Friends of yours?

1102
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:12,979
These are the newest
enlistees to the Frieza Force.

1103
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:16,405
Allow me to introduce my
servants‐‐Broly and his father.

1104
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:17,937
[PARAGUS]
I am Paragus.

1105
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,068
I’m sure you’ll get along.

1106
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,196
As you’ve noticed,
they’re Saiyans‐‐

1107
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:24,081
from your annihilated
home world.

1108
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,991
I’ve never seen them before.

1109
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:28,038
[FRIEZA] I understand that
when you were quite young

1110
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,833
your father did a
great disservice

1111
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,205
to Paragus and Broly here.

1112
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:34,131
Condemning the poor boy
to a repugnant world.

1113
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:37,921
They were trapped there until
my people rescued them,

1114
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:41,838
so you can imagine what rage
burns within their soul.

1115
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:48,855
Tell me one thing.

1116
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:51,731
[GOKU]
What’s "repugnant" mean?

1117
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:52,944
[ALL]
Uh!

1118
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,983
[FRIEZA]
Mm!

1119
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,775
It refers to something
incredibly miserable.

1120
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,901
Oh, that makes sense.
Cool. Thanks.

1121
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,698
Such a moron...

1122
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:02,950
[growling]

1123
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:06,743
I swear you will pay,
Vegeta. Dearly.

1124
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:08,119
[VEGETA]
Hm?

1125
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,115
The sins of your father
are on your head, Prince!

1126
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:12,498
[growls]

1127
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:13,883
[VEGETA]
Don’t be ridiculous.

1128
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,249
This isn’t my business.

1129
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,245
[GOKU] He doesn’t have
anything to do with this!

1130
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,457
Come on, we’re all Saiyans here.

1131
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,920
We should try to get along.

1132
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:24,428
[BROLY growls]

1133
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:27,183
Shall we begin?

1134
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:30,644
[growling]

1135
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:32,938
It would seem he can’t wait
to get a piece of them.

1136
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,270
Very well, then.

1137
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:37,936
Show me how powerful this
boy of yours really is.

1138
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,115
It would be my pleasure.

1139
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:41,284
This is our chance, my son.

1140
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,281
Attack!

1141
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:46,445
[yells]

1142
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,450
[VEGETA chuckles]

1143
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,120
[yells]

1144
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,049
[BROLY yells]

1145
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,335
You’re not half bad.

1146
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,390
This might end up being
a pretty good warmup.

1147
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:09,972
[yells]

1148
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:21,358
[BROLY yells]

1149
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,816
[VEGETA]
He’s fast.

1150
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:26,447
He must have studied
how to use his power.

1151
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:28,952
[VEGETA yells]

1152
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:34,327
It looks like Prince Vegeta

1153
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,794
is a skilled fighter
in his own right.

1154
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:39,165
These Saiyans have certainly
been through their fair share

1155
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:40,593
of battles over the years.

1156
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:44,051
Of course, your son seems
adept at brawling himself.

1157
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,894
And yet, Broly has
never actually fought

1158
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,350
another person, correct?

1159
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,888
[PARAGUS] Only during
training matches with me.

1160
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:54,024
[FRIEZA] But fighting against
someone of your power level is

1161
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:56,141
practically meaningless.

1162
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,190
[FRIEZA]
Not to worry.

1163
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:01,022
It’s obvious that
he’s quick to adapt.

1164
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:07,073
[VEGETA yells]

1165
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,197
[BROLY yells]

1166
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:14,867
Don’t let up! Broly!

1167
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:17,167
[BROLY, VEGETA grunting]

1168

[BROLY, VEGETA grunting]

1169
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:28,181
This is gettin’ annoying.

[PARAGUS gasps]
What did he just do?

1173
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:03,249
Hold on. Can Broly not
turn into a Super Saiyan?

1174
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,258
That’s certainly
a disappointment.

1175
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:08,379
What? A Super Saiyan?

1176
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,677
Like the legend?

1177
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:12,261
That’s a myth!

He’s holding his own while
still in his base form!

would be such a
formidable opponent.

1203

What’s the matter?
Has your son reached his limit?

I... believe so.

1205
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,385
Well, that’s unfortunate.

1206
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:25,396
In that case,
we’ll consider this fight over.

to engage anymore!

Stand down and come back!

Have you ever see a Saiyan

Please tell me you brought a few

Uh. No. I forgot.

I’m... not sure.

1248
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,988
It looks as though he’s managed
to transform somehow

1249
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:23,281
and take on the incredible
strength the Saiyans

have whenever they
become Great Apes.

1251
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:27,994
Only he’s remaining
in his human form,

1252
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:30,118
retaining his speed and agility.

1253

Maybe. A big one.

Huh?

01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:37,797
[exhales] He can’t control it.

[GOGETA chuckles]

1613
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:52,091
If they keep fighting,
Broly’s gonna be killed!

1614
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:52,710
Damn his father.

1615
01:24:52,796 --> 01:24:54,296
He turned him into this.

1616
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:56,763
In his heart, Broly’s
just a confused boy.

1617
01:24:56,842 --> 01:24:58,642
I can’t sit around
and let him die.

1618
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,140
He’s a pure, kindhearted Saiyan

1619
01:25:00,262 --> 01:25:01,472
whose only friend in the
universe was an animal.

1620
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:04,137
We can’t let this be his end!

1621
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:06,306
Hurry, Lemo,
we don’t have much time!

Wha‐‐? No!

1635
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:25,559
I shall grant you any one wish
that is within my power.

1636
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:27,851
[CHEELAI]
Okay. What do we say next?

1637
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:29,273
Hurry up with it.

1639

[LEMO]
Don’t even think about it.

1640
01:26:31,103 --> 01:26:32,313
Fine, then. I’ll shoot.

1641
01:26:32,396 --> 01:26:36,356
No, no, please don’t!
I’ll read it now.

1642
01:26:36,441 --> 01:26:40,111
It says, "Just say whatever
you want to wish for."

1643
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:41,065
That’s all?

1644
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:43,356
I thought it’d be harder.

1645
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:47,200
[CHEELAI]
All right, listen up, Dragon!

How truly magnificent!

01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:26,297
I think this battle is about
to come to a rousing finale.

Save Broly!

1671
01:28:55,539 --> 01:29:00,459
And send him back to the planet
he grew up on! Please, Dragon!

1672
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:12,472
Huh?

1673
01:29:15,642 --> 01:29:19,062
[BROLY grunting]

1674
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:25,614
[SHENRON]
Your wish has been granted.

1675
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:27,994
Farewell!

Quick! Get in, Cheelai!

1679
01:29:48,842 --> 01:29:50,182
[CHEELAI]
See ya!

1680
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:56,137
[FRIEZA grunts]

1681
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:00,557

Not so fast.

1682
01:30:00,687 --> 01:30:01,147
[GOGETA chuckles]

1683
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:10,113
[FRIEZA grunts]

1684
01:30:12,198 --> 01:30:16,038
I will be back for
this planet one day.

1685
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:22,419
[GOGETA]
Hmph.

1686
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:25,382
[coos]

1687
01:30:27,213 --> 01:30:31,093
[BEERUS] Mm... Looks like
everything turned out all right.

1688
01:30:36,348 --> 01:30:37,598
[CHEELAI]
Sorry for what happened.

1689
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:39,932
I didn’t mean for you
to get mixed up in things.

1690
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:41,600
Don’t worry about it.

1691
01:30:41,686 --> 01:30:44,106
Y’know, these have been
the most exciting few days

1692
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:48,570
I’ve had since I joined
the Frieza Force.

1693
01:30:48,652 --> 01:30:50,532
[CHEELAI]
Think they’ll come after us?

1694
01:30:50,612 --> 01:30:53,282
It’s hard to say.

1695
01:30:53,406 --> 01:30:56,576
So, where are you planning
to go now, Cheelai?

1696
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:58,160
Back to Broly’s world.

1697
01:30:58,286 --> 01:30:59,746
Vampa, really?

1698
01:30:59,829 --> 01:31:02,329
[CHEELAI] I can always drop you
off somewhere along the way.

1699
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:05,327
Nah, I think I’ll tag along
with you for a while.

1700
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:07,880
I’m a wanted man no matter where
I go after what we just pulled.

1701
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:10,093
Having Broly to protect us

1702
01:31:10,173 --> 01:31:12,763
might actually put
my mind at ease a bit.

1703
01:31:12,842 --> 01:31:14,142
Whoa!

1704
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:18,390
Well, if that’s the case,

1705
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:21,983
we should stop and pick up
some food and supplies.

1706
01:31:22,102 --> 01:31:23,312
[KIKONO]
Sure enough, my lord.

1707
01:31:23,395 --> 01:31:26,655
It appears both the traitors
are with Broly.

1708
01:31:26,773 --> 01:31:30,113
[FRIEZA] Then let us leave them
alone for the time being.

1709
01:31:30,193 --> 01:31:31,823
We’ll allow them to
domesticate the brute

1710
01:31:31,945 --> 01:31:33,705
and bring his mind
under control.

1711
01:31:33,822 --> 01:31:36,662
Once he can release that immense
power without losing his senses,

1712
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:38,661
I’ll come back for him.

1713
01:31:38,785 --> 01:31:41,005
That’s when he’ll become
my mightiest warrior.

1714
01:31:41,371 --> 01:31:44,331
Do you think that will work,
Lord Frieza?

1715
01:31:44,457 --> 01:31:50,167
I certainly hope that it does,
for all of our sakes.

1716
01:31:50,296 --> 01:31:52,506
No matter how much I manage
to raise my battle power,

1717
01:31:52,632 --> 01:31:57,182
my most hated foes, Goku and
Vegeta, remain triumphant.

1718
01:31:58,346 --> 01:32:02,136
I would like to have
someone at my disposal...

1719
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:03,845
...to massacre them.

1720
01:32:03,935 --> 01:32:06,345
[laughs]

1721
01:32:22,954 --> 01:32:24,044
You’re kidding, aren’t you?

1722
01:32:24,122 --> 01:32:27,082
This is what you’ve
been surviving on?

1723
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:28,288
Bleurgh.

1724
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:29,416
Well, it’s sour,
but I guess it’s better

1725
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:32,384
than starving to death.
You tried it yet?

1726
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:35,224
[LEMO]
Mm? Hmm...

1727
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:36,260
[LEMO gags]

1728
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:38,764
[LEMO]
Nope. Count me out.

1729
01:32:38,887 --> 01:32:40,717
[CHEELAI] You won’t be
saying that for long.

1730
01:32:40,847 --> 01:32:43,217
We can’t even last 50 days
on the food we brought.

1731
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:46,100
[BROLY grunts]

1732
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:47,727
Somebody else just got here.

1733
01:32:47,812 --> 01:32:49,062
Huh?

1734
01:32:49,189 --> 01:32:51,229
[GOKU]
Hey! Can I come in?

1735
01:32:51,357 --> 01:32:52,227
[LEMO grunting]

1736
01:32:54,986 --> 01:32:55,896
What the‐‐?

1737
01:32:55,987 --> 01:32:57,947
Wait, hold on. Who are you guys?

1738
01:32:58,073 --> 01:32:59,243
You’re that Saiyan!

1739
01:32:59,324 --> 01:33:01,164
The one he fought on Earth!

1740
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:02,742
Oh, I remember!

1741
01:33:02,827 --> 01:33:05,247
You’re the ones who used the
Dragon Balls instead of Frieza.

1742
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:06,580
What are you doing on Vampa?

1743
01:33:06,706 --> 01:33:08,746
Wha‐‐?

1744
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:12,211
So, Broly, are these guys
your friends now?

1745
01:33:12,295 --> 01:33:13,415
[LEMO]
Don’t ignore me!

1746
01:33:13,505 --> 01:33:14,765
I asked you a question!

1747
01:33:14,881 --> 01:33:16,131
Hey, come on, no need
to lose your temper.

1748
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:19,257
I’m not here to
fight today. I swear.

1749
01:33:19,344 --> 01:33:20,764
Then start talking.

1750
01:33:20,887 --> 01:33:23,307
From what I heard,
this world is "repugnant."

1751
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:26,141
So, I brought him some
good stuff from Earth.

1752
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:28,267
Who asked you to do that?!
Get outta here.

1753
01:33:28,353 --> 01:33:30,153
I’m not gonna let you trick him!

1754
01:33:30,271 --> 01:33:31,271
[laughs]

1755
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:35,937
I asked my friend Bulma
to make you these capsules.

1756
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:37,647
She’s real smart.

1757
01:33:38,488 --> 01:33:41,238
You, uh, might wanna stand back.

1758
01:33:43,952 --> 01:33:46,122
[LEMO, CHEELAI gasp]

1759
01:33:46,204 --> 01:33:48,664
[GOKU] There’s food, water, and
a bunch of other stuff inside.

1760
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:50,790
Go on, have a look
for yourselves.

1761
01:33:50,917 --> 01:33:51,377
[BOTH gasping]

1762
01:33:54,379 --> 01:33:56,879
[GOKU] Oh, yeah, and these
are called senzu beans.

1763
01:33:56,965 --> 01:33:58,385
I’m giving you two of them.

1764
01:33:58,466 --> 01:34:01,216
Eat one if you ever think,
"Yikes, I’m gonna die!" Okay?

1765
01:34:01,302 --> 01:34:03,642
They don’t work
against illnesses,

1766
01:34:03,763 --> 01:34:05,063
but they’ll completely heal
any of your battle injuries

1767
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:07,810
and restore you to full power.

1768
01:34:07,892 --> 01:34:09,022
Bet the house’ll
shrink down and kill us.

1769
01:34:09,144 --> 01:34:11,904
It’s not like that, trust me.

1770
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:14,020
I just want you guys
to be safe and healthy.

1771
01:34:14,149 --> 01:34:15,569
[BOTH]
Why?

1772
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:18,530
I was so sure my strength
was getting close to its peak,

1773
01:34:18,653 --> 01:34:22,373
but then this guy showed up and
was so much stronger than me.

1774
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:25,160
And he’s a Saiyan,
just like I am.

1775
01:34:25,243 --> 01:34:26,453
He’s probably even
stronger than Beerus.

1776
01:34:26,536 --> 01:34:29,996
Oh, Beerus is a God of
Destruction, by the way.

1777
01:34:30,123 --> 01:34:31,713
[WHIS]
Classy...

1778
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:34,003
It’d be a shame to see
someone so incredible

1779
01:34:34,127 --> 01:34:36,047
die on this planet.

1780
01:34:36,171 --> 01:34:38,801
Then who would I train against?

1781
01:34:44,179 --> 01:34:45,259
[GOKU]
Well, anyway.

1782
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:47,716
Make sure you take
care of yourselves.

1783
01:34:47,849 --> 01:34:49,019
Later.

1784
01:34:49,142 --> 01:34:50,392
[LEMO]
Uhh...? I don’t see a ship.

1785
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:53,058
How’d you even get all
the way to this planet?

1786
01:34:53,188 --> 01:34:55,768
I tracked Broly’s energy here.

1787
01:34:55,857 --> 01:34:57,017
I used my Instant
Transmission technique.

1788
01:34:57,150 --> 01:34:58,440
I basically don’t understand

1789
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:01,606
a single thing you’ve
said this whole time.

1790
01:35:01,696 --> 01:35:03,196
Is it okay if I come back again?

1791
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:04,571
Just so you know,

1792
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:06,369
we still view you as
an enemy, you got that?

1793
01:35:06,451 --> 01:35:08,081
We may have quit
the Frieza Force,

1794
01:35:08,203 --> 01:35:10,333
but we’re not gonna befriend

1795
01:35:10,413 --> 01:35:12,793
every Saiyan we meet
on some remote planet.

1796
01:35:12,874 --> 01:35:15,384
That’s fine, doesn’t
matter to me either way.

1797
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:16,750
[CHEELAI]
It doesn’t?

1798
01:35:16,878 --> 01:35:18,628
[GOKU] As long as you
let me come and fight Broly

1799
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:20,843
every once in a while, I’m good.

1800
01:35:20,924 --> 01:35:22,094
Huh...?

1801
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:23,927
There’s plenty of stuff
I want to teach him, too‐‐

1802
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:26,552
if he’s interested.

1803
01:35:26,679 --> 01:35:28,929
I think you’ve been hit in
the head one too many times.

1804
01:35:29,057 --> 01:35:30,977
Really? Why’s that?

1805
01:35:31,059 --> 01:35:34,099
Eh. Never mind, I guess
I should be grateful.

1806
01:35:34,229 --> 01:35:35,899
So, yeah. Thanks?

1807
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:36,770
Oh, sure.

1808
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:38,898
Bye, then, I’ll see
you all later.

1809
01:35:38,983 --> 01:35:41,993
You realize we might not even
be here when you return, right?

1810
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:43,490
That’s not a problem at all.

1811
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:46,951
As long as you’re not too
far away, I can find you.
