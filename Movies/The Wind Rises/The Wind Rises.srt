1
00:05:09,545 --> 00:05:10,728
Jiro, here it is.

2
00:05:15,989 --> 00:05:17,795
Would it be alright if I borrow it?

3
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,312
It's not Japanese.

4
00:05:19,327 --> 00:05:20,821
That's okay. I have a dictionary.

5
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:22,330
Alright then, give it a try.

6
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:22,975
Thank you.

7
00:05:42,261 --> 00:05:42,975
Knock it off.

8
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,332
Stay out of it, Jiro!

9
00:05:44,352 --> 00:05:45,507
Go home! Now!

10
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:47,618
Jiro...

11
00:05:48,437 --> 00:05:50,003
He's half your size, Katayama.

12
00:06:07,856 --> 00:06:10,165
Ah... you look quite the hero.

13
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:12,452
No, I just slipped and fell.

14
00:06:13,528 --> 00:06:15,201
Fighting is never justified.

15
00:06:15,216 --> 00:06:16,217
Yes, mother.

16
00:06:17,487 --> 00:06:19,538
Alright. Now you can go have your snack.

17
00:06:20,177 --> 00:06:20,850
Thanks.

18
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,446
Jiro, you're home!

19
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:27,563
Welcome home.

20
00:06:27,578 --> 00:06:32,232
Oh, Jiro, now we can pick some bamboo grass.

21
00:06:32,746 --> 00:06:33,752
Jiro!

22
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,867
Wait, where are you going?

23
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:46,894
You promised to pick bamboo grass today.

24
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:47,815
I got homework.

25
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,205
What kind of homework is that?

26
00:06:56,338 --> 00:06:57,705
It's an English magazine.

27
00:07:01,084 --> 00:07:02,924
Oh, look at that stupid mustache.

28
00:07:03,264 --> 00:07:05,459
He's a very famous Italian aircraft designer.

29
00:07:05,976 --> 00:07:10,497
His name is Caproni. Wow, it says he's a count.

30
00:07:11,106 --> 00:07:13,112
What happened? Your face is scratched.

31
00:07:13,128 --> 00:07:14,350
Leave it alone, Kayo!

32
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:17,393
You should put iodine on it. I'll do it for you.

33
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:18,679
Would you cut it out!

34
00:07:30,612 --> 00:07:32,056
What are you doing up here?

35
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:33,742
You're not suppose to be up here.

36
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,506
Where are your glasses?

37
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:40,001
I heard you can fix your eyesight by
focusing very intently on the stars.

38
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,340
Mom will be mad if you're not in your bed.

39
00:07:43,355 --> 00:07:44,571
I see a shooting star!

40
00:07:46,164 --> 00:07:47,542
Oh, there's another one.

41
00:07:48,616 --> 00:07:52,543
Ah, they're pretty. Oh, look at that one!

42
00:07:53,422 --> 00:07:58,056
Wow, there's so many of them.

43
00:08:30,153 --> 00:08:32,830
Ehi, ma tu chi saresti?

44
00:08:33,464 --> 00:08:34,789
I'm a Japanese boy.

45
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:36,694
Un ragazzo giapponese?

46
00:08:37,364 --> 00:08:39,542
Come mai ti trovi qua?

47
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:43,296
I'm dreaming. I think this is my dream.

48
00:08:43,312 --> 00:08:44,294
Un sogno?

49
00:08:44,804 --> 00:08:47,219
Ferma i motori!

50
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:02,254
This is my dream, you know.

51
00:09:02,652 --> 00:09:04,319
I think it's mine too.

52
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:05,700
Your dream?

53
00:09:06,302 --> 00:09:10,224
Listen, Japanese boy. So you
think we are sharing this dream?

54
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:11,679
I hope so.

55
00:09:12,057 --> 00:09:15,991
You're count Caproni, aren't you?
I've been reading all about you.

56
00:09:17,887 --> 00:09:22,085
Interesting. Yes, this is a dream. This world is a dream.

57
00:09:22,485 --> 00:09:23,972
Welcome to my kingdom.

58
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:25,011
I'm honored.

59
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,250
Look at them.

60
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:38,244
They will bomb an enemy city.
Most of them will never return.

61
00:09:44,494 --> 00:09:46,754
Well, it'll all be over very soon.

62
00:09:56,124 --> 00:09:57,822
Come on up, Japanese boy.

63
00:10:00,284 --> 00:10:05,243
This is my true dream. When
the war is over, I'll build this.

64
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,729
What do you think? Magnificent, isn't she?

65
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:11,336
Let's take off.

66
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:18,032
Instead of bombs, she'll carry passengers.

67
00:10:27,437 --> 00:10:29,662
I find dreams are a good way

68
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:33,132
to see my designs. I can go anywhere.

69
00:10:40,283 --> 00:10:43,857
Come on, walk along the spar, Japanese boy.

70
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:50,244
Look at that.

71
00:11:25,173 --> 00:11:27,348
She's beautiful, yes?

72
00:11:27,363 --> 00:11:28,667
Yes, incredible.

73
00:11:33,798 --> 00:11:36,764
She'll carry a hundred people across the Atlantic.

74
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:41,761
Mr. Caproni, may I ask you a question?

75
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,186
I know I can't be a pilot because of my eyesight.

76
00:11:48,811 --> 00:11:51,945
If I'm not a pilot, can I still design airplanes?

77
00:11:53,408 --> 00:11:54,465
Japanese boy,

78
00:11:54,682 --> 00:11:59,262
I've been around planes all my life. You
know how many I've flown? None! Not any one!

79
00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:02,982
Many can fly a plane but I design them.

80
00:12:03,216 --> 00:12:08,455
I create airplanes and so can
you. An aeronautical engineer!

81
00:12:08,526 --> 00:12:09,282
Yes!

82
00:12:09,576 --> 00:12:11,762
But remember this, Japanese boy.

83
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,074
Airplanes are not tools for
war. They are not for making money.

84
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:18,894
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.

85
00:12:19,124 --> 00:12:22,176
Engineers turn dreams into reality.

86
00:12:22,553 --> 00:12:23,387
Yes!

87
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:27,805
Arrivederci. We'll meet again.

88
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,553
Jiro, you were talking in your sleep.

89
00:12:45,301 --> 00:12:49,909
You were smiling. You must be
having the most wonderful dream, Jiro.

90
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,280
Mother, I'm going to be an aeronautical engineer.

91
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:56,113
Oh, that does sound like a good dream.

92
00:12:57,499 --> 00:12:59,810
He told me that airplanes are beautiful dreams.

93
00:13:00,157 --> 00:13:02,510
So I'm going to make beautiful airplanes.

94
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:34,042
Excuse me miss, please, take my seat.

95
00:13:34,234 --> 00:13:35,218
Pardon me, sir.

96
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:36,489
I insist.

97
00:14:12,682 --> 00:14:14,225
Le vent se lève.

98
00:14:16,045 --> 00:14:17,567
Miss, you'll lose your hat.

99
00:14:17,805 --> 00:14:19,052
I got it.

100
00:14:27,674 --> 00:14:28,015
Hold...

101
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,266
Miss!

102
00:14:28,282 --> 00:14:28,797
Hold on!

103
00:14:32,603 --> 00:14:33,445
Are you all right?

104
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:34,327
Safe!

105
00:14:35,623 --> 00:14:36,510
Nice catch.

106
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:38,909
You speak French?

107
00:14:39,447 --> 00:14:43,113
"Le vent se lève." It's a French poem.

108
00:14:43,457 --> 00:14:45,083
"Il faut tenter de vivre."

109
00:15:09,852 --> 00:15:13,034
"Le vent se lève. Il faut tenter de vivre."

110
00:15:14,395 --> 00:15:17,442
"The wind is rising. We must try to live."

111
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,050
Earthquake.

112
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,219
Get away! The boiler's going to blow!

113
00:17:16,814 --> 00:17:17,524
What's wrong?

114
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,332
Her leg.

115
00:17:18,536 --> 00:17:19,617
Here, let me see.

116
00:17:21,844 --> 00:17:22,518
Ah...

117
00:17:22,947 --> 00:17:24,587
Be brave, Kinu.

118
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:27,205
It's broken. She won't be able to walk.

119
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,758
Miss, the boiler. Please save yourself, go!

120
00:17:30,828 --> 00:17:31,919
That's nonsense.

121
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:35,073
Nothing's going to explode.

122
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,628
We need to brace her leg.

123
00:17:46,177 --> 00:17:48,481
This will hurt a little, relax.

124
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:56,010
She can't walk on this. Where do you live?

125
00:17:56,345 --> 00:17:57,051
In Ueno.

126
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:58,443
Don't worry, I'll get you there.

127
00:18:11,182 --> 00:18:11,686
Fire.

128
00:18:12,026 --> 00:18:12,556
Let's go.

129
00:18:29,018 --> 00:18:30,086
What about your luggage?

130
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:31,423
It's not important.

131
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:54,287
I'm so sorry.

132
00:18:54,302 --> 00:18:54,899
I'm so sorry.

133
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:55,529
Hold on, Kinu.

134
00:18:55,545 --> 00:18:56,083
You alright?

135
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,357
Okay.

136
00:19:08,323 --> 00:19:08,944
Better hurry.

137
00:19:52,802 --> 00:19:56,505
Here, my mother made me this shirt. You must be thirsty.

138
00:19:56,772 --> 00:19:57,889
Don't worry, it's clean.

139
00:20:02,707 --> 00:20:05,359
The well's almost dry... And for you?

140
00:20:05,451 --> 00:20:06,150
Please.

141
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:14,449
The fire hasn't reached Ueno and...

142
00:20:14,635 --> 00:20:17,579
I'm heading for the university. So, I can take you there.

143
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:19,533
And help bring someone, from my house.

144
00:20:19,971 --> 00:20:21,512
Then we should get going, now.

145
00:20:22,153 --> 00:20:23,952
Kinu, look after my suitcase.

146
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:24,849
Okay.

147
00:20:24,874 --> 00:20:27,426
We'll bring someone to get you home. I promise.

148
00:20:27,668 --> 00:20:28,268
Okay.

149
00:20:28,638 --> 00:20:29,353
Stay strong.

150
00:20:29,622 --> 00:20:30,431
I will.

151
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,343
Thank you very much for helping us.

152
00:21:52,358 --> 00:21:52,925
Take care of her.

153
00:21:53,932 --> 00:21:55,783
But wait, at least tell us your name.

154
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,839
What a great guy. Who was he, Kinu?

155
00:22:20,918 --> 00:22:24,058
Well, it isn't Jiro. You picked a lovely day to come back.

156
00:22:24,074 --> 00:22:25,218
How bad is it, Honjo?

157
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:28,097
Bad enough. The whole east side is burning.

158
00:22:29,786 --> 00:22:32,469
We grabbed everything we could carry out of the library.

159
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:33,745
Got a smoke?

160
00:22:39,521 --> 00:22:43,977
A flying door? Don't see that everyday.
We'll never gonna stop the fire now.

161
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:45,185
Tokyo's finished.

162
00:22:59,703 --> 00:23:03,814
It's as beautiful as it was in the
dream. I can't really believe he built it.

163
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:08,604
Cut! Cut! Cut...

164
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:17,187
Damn wind's picking up. We need to hurry.

165
00:24:20,873 --> 00:24:24,313
What do you think, Japanese boy? Is the wind still rising?

166
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:26,982
Yes, it's a gale.

167
00:24:28,107 --> 00:24:31,686
Well then, you must live. "Le vent se lève."

168
00:24:32,336 --> 00:24:34,770
"Ii faut tenter de vivre."

169
00:25:33,787 --> 00:25:35,148
Jiro, let's eat.

170
00:25:38,533 --> 00:25:40,916
Look, even the new buildings are old-fashioned.

171
00:25:41,525 --> 00:25:43,389
If the streets are a little wider.

172
00:25:43,697 --> 00:25:45,669
So? The airplanes are still old.

173
00:25:48,102 --> 00:25:49,434
Welcome!

174
00:25:54,544 --> 00:25:55,997
Oh look, mackerel again?

175
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:57,286
Yeah, it's always good.

176
00:25:57,804 --> 00:26:01,297
Always. Always the same lunch, always the same mackerel.

177
00:26:01,342 --> 00:26:01,973
Kina, may I have your aid?

178
00:26:01,988 --> 00:26:02,571
Coming up!

179
00:26:03,336 --> 00:26:05,907
Meanwhile, other countries are building metal planes.

180
00:26:06,995 --> 00:26:09,202
We're 10 years behind

181
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:11,562
and you're still stuck with mackerel.

182
00:26:12,849 --> 00:26:13,565
What is that?

183
00:26:14,653 --> 00:26:15,655
Beautiful, isn't it?

184
00:26:16,313 --> 00:26:18,046
Look at that wonderful curve.

185
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:21,613
Only you would get a thrill from fish bones.

186
00:26:22,438 --> 00:26:24,861
Come on, finish up. I need a coffee.

187
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:39,494
What on earth is Jiro working so hard on?

188
00:26:39,888 --> 00:26:40,661
Fish bones.

189
00:26:42,171 --> 00:26:43,982
Is Mr. Horikoshi back from lunch?

190
00:26:44,367 --> 00:26:45,006
Jiro!

191
00:26:45,617 --> 00:26:47,347
Honjo, listen to this.

192
00:26:47,861 --> 00:26:51,813
The NACA has a standard wing-cross
section just like the curve of this fish bone.

193
00:26:52,126 --> 00:26:54,062
Maybe the Americans eat mackerel too.

194
00:26:54,276 --> 00:26:55,746
Jiro, you got a visitor.

195
00:26:56,679 --> 00:26:57,010
Yes?

196
00:26:57,025 --> 00:27:00,433
A young lady came by and brought
this package for you, Mr. Horikoshi.

197
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:03,301
You were out, so she left it with me.

198
00:27:03,356 --> 00:27:05,621
I see. Thank you very much.

199
00:27:07,642 --> 00:27:10,341
Ah, is that a present from your girlfriend, Jiro?

200
00:27:10,357 --> 00:27:13,250
Can it, freshman, and give me a smoke.

201
00:27:29,851 --> 00:27:30,688
Jiro!

202
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:31,678
Let him go.

203
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,502
Oh, Mr. Horikoshi.

204
00:27:57,517 --> 00:27:58,160
Yes, mam?

205
00:27:58,479 --> 00:28:02,392
You've a guest waiting for
you upstairs. It's a young lady.

206
00:28:02,977 --> 00:28:04,348
Huh, young lady?

207
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:13,707
Hello?

208
00:28:14,008 --> 00:28:15,572
Finally, where were you?

209
00:28:16,283 --> 00:28:17,829
Kayo, I'm sorry.

210
00:28:19,361 --> 00:28:20,298
Completely forgot.

211
00:28:20,504 --> 00:28:21,753
I'm not surprised!

212
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,110
Where's mother?

213
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,189
At uncle's.

214
00:28:24,518 --> 00:28:25,517
Is she staying there?

215
00:28:26,016 --> 00:28:27,062
Just for a night.

216
00:28:28,042 --> 00:28:31,863
Kayo, you've gotten so tall and very pretty too.

217
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:36,311
You're so insensitive. I'm still
mad at you 'cause you never come home!

218
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:42,711
Oh, the sun is already down. I'm going to be late.

219
00:28:42,928 --> 00:28:47,030
I'll tell them it's my fault. Don't
worry. We'll take the penny steamer.

220
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:52,095
I think she must really like you.

221
00:28:52,445 --> 00:28:54,455
I don't know, it's been over two years.

222
00:28:55,336 --> 00:28:57,642
Didn't you ever try to see her again?

223
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,519
I did. I went back after the fire was out.

224
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,667
Her house has burnt down.

225
00:29:14,412 --> 00:29:15,283
That's terrible.

226
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:16,731
Here, let's catch this one.

227
00:29:30,308 --> 00:29:31,278
Are you cold, Kayo?

228
00:29:31,468 --> 00:29:35,302
I'm fine. I didn't think Tokyo would recover so quickly.

229
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:42,572
Jiro, maybe I can stay here with you?

230
00:29:43,161 --> 00:29:45,399
Father won't let me live here by myself.

231
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:49,398
Well, I might be at Nagoya by the time you come.

232
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:51,209
With an airplane company?

233
00:29:51,237 --> 00:29:51,888
I hope so.

234
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:53,805
Men have it so good.

235
00:29:54,744 --> 00:29:57,587
Why can't I live in Tokyo and go to medical school?

236
00:29:58,152 --> 00:30:01,295
Medical school? You should, I
think you make a great doctor.

237
00:30:02,226 --> 00:30:03,252
I think so too.

238
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:06,239
When I'm home for new years, I'll talk to father about it.

239
00:30:06,467 --> 00:30:08,082
Oh, thank you.

240
00:31:14,702 --> 00:31:15,762
Hey, Jiro!

241
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,123
Heavy?

242
00:31:19,138 --> 00:31:19,448
Yep.

243
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,664
Glad you made it.

244
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,244
Me too.

245
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,745
We are just getting started.

246
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,531
We certainly are.

247
00:31:42,376 --> 00:31:45,643
Well, they are probably heading
for the city to look for work.

248
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:46,826
There are dozens of of them.

249
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:48,915
And there will be hundreds more.

250
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:57,806
Ah, looks like we lost another
bank. Tough time is coming, Hachi.

251
00:32:02,751 --> 00:32:03,592
It's awful.

252
00:32:03,607 --> 00:32:04,644
I'm so sad.

253
00:32:04,796 --> 00:32:05,872
There were rumors.

254
00:32:08,003 --> 00:32:12,414
The economy's in the tank. I hate to
break to you Jiro but so is our new employer.

255
00:32:31,139 --> 00:32:34,670
You know the pressure we are under.
We needed you here over a month ago.

256
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,363
But sir, I was told I could start anytime in April.

257
00:32:37,504 --> 00:32:39,518
Then you should've been here in march!

258
00:32:39,534 --> 00:32:39,962
Yes, sir.

259
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:42,829
I got a very important assignment for you.

260
00:32:43,196 --> 00:32:43,658
Yes, sir.

261
00:32:44,134 --> 00:32:47,003
It's the design for the wing strut
fitting and by the way, it's already late!

262
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:47,392
Yes, sir.

263
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,397
I need the plan in the shop as soon
as possible. Do what you have to do.

264
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,032
Yes, sir.

265
00:32:55,756 --> 00:32:56,306
Here.

266
00:32:58,421 --> 00:33:01,565
Let's get you summary specification. Follow me.

267
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:11,395
This will be your desk.

268
00:33:11,505 --> 00:33:14,523
It's imported, nobody likes it. Maybe you will.

269
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:15,002
Yes, sir.

270
00:33:15,018 --> 00:33:16,889
Work goes here, hat goes there.

271
00:33:16,905 --> 00:33:17,406
Yes, sir.

272
00:33:17,645 --> 00:33:22,393
Listen up! This is the new engineer on the falcon project.

273
00:33:22,512 --> 00:33:24,658
It's that genius we've been hearing all about.

274
00:33:25,122 --> 00:33:26,192
Name? Genius.

275
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:28,427
Jiro Horikoshi. I'm very happy to be here.

276
00:33:28,443 --> 00:33:29,143
Get to work.

277
00:33:29,794 --> 00:33:30,262
Yes, sir.

278
00:33:30,278 --> 00:33:32,612
And the rest of you, get back to work!

279
00:35:07,929 --> 00:35:10,294
Jiro, Jiro.

280
00:35:11,037 --> 00:35:11,746
Let's eat.

281
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:15,992
Let's go see the assembly floor.

282
00:35:16,255 --> 00:35:18,080
Could we maybe have lunch first?

283
00:35:18,853 --> 00:35:23,983
Maybe Kurokawa simply hates you. Why else would
he have you design that strut on your first day.

284
00:35:24,332 --> 00:35:25,372
Two, please.

285
00:35:25,796 --> 00:35:29,023
Excuse me. Could we ask a slight favor?

286
00:35:29,343 --> 00:35:31,441
Wow, it's really coming along.

287
00:35:31,495 --> 00:35:34,825
Thank you again for making time for us on your break.

288
00:35:35,055 --> 00:35:38,980
No problem at all. You young
engineers should visit here more often.

289
00:35:39,654 --> 00:35:42,579
Honjo, look, the strut has already been installed.

290
00:35:42,776 --> 00:35:43,835
I knew it.

291
00:35:43,913 --> 00:35:48,116
Kurokawa is obviously just hazing you,
unless his fitting is better than yours...

292
00:35:48,298 --> 00:35:50,983
Mr. Kurokawa is always tough on new employees.

293
00:35:51,606 --> 00:35:53,791
Honjo, come up here and take a look.

294
00:35:54,962 --> 00:35:55,926
Something is not right.

295
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:03,008
What do you think?

296
00:36:03,175 --> 00:36:04,735
It looks all right to me.

297
00:36:04,761 --> 00:36:08,072
No, this isn't good. It got
the same problem with my design.

298
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,704
Then it must be bad.

299
00:36:10,437 --> 00:36:12,326
Foreman, lunch's over. What's going on?

300
00:36:12,342 --> 00:36:13,519
Quiet! They are working.

301
00:36:14,271 --> 00:36:17,331
I love it! Airplanes are fascinating!

302
00:36:17,394 --> 00:36:19,372
Yea, fascinating but we're late.

303
00:36:28,766 --> 00:36:29,648
Young man.

304
00:36:34,121 --> 00:36:36,131
This is our boss, Mr. Hattori.

305
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:37,958
This is his first assignment?

306
00:36:38,086 --> 00:36:40,285
Strut fitting for the falcon project, sir.

307
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:43,868
Not what I've expected. What am I looking at here?

308
00:36:43,992 --> 00:36:47,698
Sir, the steel leaf-spring will
ease the stress from the wing.

309
00:36:48,107 --> 00:36:51,850
This wire expands and contracts,
absorbing the forces that act on the wing.

310
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:55,168
I have it running thru' the strut
and anchoring it on the fuselage.

311
00:36:55,771 --> 00:36:59,235
That means that we would have to
entirely re-design the length of the wing!

312
00:36:59,402 --> 00:37:02,023
You're right. I'll run the calculations tonight, sir.

313
00:37:02,396 --> 00:37:06,338
You're wasting your time. Where's the
assignment that I gave to you this morning?

314
00:37:06,568 --> 00:37:09,304
Right here, sir. I finished it.

315
00:37:12,729 --> 00:37:15,960
Well done. What do you think, Kurokawa?

316
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:18,656
It's perfect.

317
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,617
Turn in your work as soon as you're done!

318
00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:22,508
Yes, sir.

319
00:37:24,962 --> 00:37:27,150
What a day, I'm heading out.

320
00:37:27,165 --> 00:37:27,761
Me too.

321
00:37:28,445 --> 00:37:31,071
Wild guess, you already finished Kurokawa's homework?

322
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,107
Just about.

323
00:37:37,204 --> 00:37:38,320
What's the oxen for?

324
00:37:38,451 --> 00:37:40,862
Oh, they haul the prototypes to the field.

325
00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:45,676
Takes them 2 days to drag it out there.
You believe that? That's how backward we are.

326
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,292
I don't know. I like them.

327
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,876
Here she comes.

328
00:38:54,645 --> 00:38:56,039
Almost here!

329
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,865
Almost here!

330
00:39:06,962 --> 00:39:08,970
What? This stupid thing.

331
00:39:09,026 --> 00:39:09,921
Damn it!

332
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:20,750
Tell me you got it?

333
00:39:20,765 --> 00:39:23,708
13.3 seconds. 146 knots.

334
00:39:23,811 --> 00:39:26,695
Blast. She needs more horse power.

335
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,682
She deserves better.

336
00:39:30,349 --> 00:39:32,218
Hey, Kurokawa!

337
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:33,223
Yes, sir?

338
00:39:33,366 --> 00:39:34,662
A word with the clients.

339
00:39:35,304 --> 00:39:36,043
Gentlemen?

340
00:39:36,161 --> 00:39:36,699
Well done.

341
00:39:36,889 --> 00:39:38,134
Yea, your falcon is one hell of a plane!

342
00:39:38,149 --> 00:39:41,238
And I bet Mitsubishi couldn't
do it. Now I'm buying drinks!

343
00:39:58,921 --> 00:40:02,231
Power dive. He's trying to break 200 knots.

344
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:26,917
The chute!

345
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:27,842
Go get him!

346
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:48,079
Mr. Kurokawa, let's investigate what happened
when the weather clears. It would be easier.

347
00:40:48,683 --> 00:40:49,661
How's the pilot?

348
00:40:49,796 --> 00:40:50,439
He's okay.

349
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,553
That's good.

350
00:40:52,697 --> 00:40:56,287
Let's go, Mr. Kurokawa. We'll re-group, for falcon two.

351
00:40:57,212 --> 00:41:00,442
Here you'll be straight with me. Do
you think the strut fitting failed?

352
00:41:00,807 --> 00:41:05,622
No. I think the problem here is much
deeper and more complicated than we thought.

353
00:41:06,044 --> 00:41:08,595
I'll never forget what I saw today.

354
00:41:08,858 --> 00:41:12,200
It's like an endless road is opened up before my eyes.

355
00:41:13,885 --> 00:41:15,761
There won't be a falcon two.

356
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:19,382
The army has decided to go with the competing design.

357
00:41:21,089 --> 00:41:24,237
Today was our last shot to change their minds.

358
00:41:24,824 --> 00:41:28,927
Though we have to shift course. We're
gonna to design and build the heavy bomber,

359
00:41:29,317 --> 00:41:31,117
with help from the Germans.

360
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,919
You're going to Germany to study
Junker's design. I recommended you.

361
00:42:12,862 --> 00:42:13,473
Still open?

362
00:42:13,488 --> 00:42:15,601
Ah, welcome back.

363
00:42:16,554 --> 00:42:17,403
Your usual?

364
00:42:18,076 --> 00:42:19,868
Yea, but 2 slices this time.

365
00:42:20,042 --> 00:42:20,781
Coming up.

366
00:42:28,316 --> 00:42:29,210
Here you go.

367
00:42:30,426 --> 00:42:31,339
Who looks after them?

368
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:36,772
Well, their parents work late.
They wait there every night.

369
00:42:37,307 --> 00:42:39,557
I feel bad closing the place up.

370
00:42:39,946 --> 00:42:41,580
I see. Well, thanks.

371
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:42,861
See you tomorrow.

372
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:53,435
Are you hungry? I've 2 slices of sponge cake.

373
00:42:54,056 --> 00:42:56,905
You can have them. It's okay, I just bought them.

374
00:43:04,717 --> 00:43:05,196
See.

375
00:43:09,205 --> 00:43:10,341
Go ahead, take it.

376
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,167
Come on!

377
00:43:29,175 --> 00:43:29,618
Jiro?

378
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:36,024
Wake up! I heard they axed the
falcon project. I need details.

379
00:43:37,914 --> 00:43:41,049
Sponge cake again? How do you stay alive?

380
00:43:51,961 --> 00:43:53,185
What did you expect?

381
00:43:54,514 --> 00:43:57,926
Did you think she was just going
to smile and say "thank you, sir".

382
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,027
Of course not.

383
00:44:00,402 --> 00:44:02,307
Well, maybe I did.

384
00:44:03,855 --> 00:44:08,531
Well, if you're looking for a mouth to feed, there happen
to be plenty of other hungry kids in this neighborhood.

385
00:44:09,645 --> 00:44:14,919
And their parents are probably hungrier. It's shameful.
I bet it's gonna get worse before it gets better.

386
00:44:15,566 --> 00:44:18,073
I don't understand why this country is so poor.

387
00:44:18,909 --> 00:44:23,722
Poor Jiro, stuck in his happy dreams.
What Japan is paying the Germans,

388
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:28,739
they can feed every single man, woman
and child a mountain of sponge cake

389
00:44:29,244 --> 00:44:32,830
but if this country wants airplanes,
then I'm gonna make the most of it.

390
00:44:33,428 --> 00:44:34,779
Really? They're sending you too?

391
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:36,238
They told me today.

392
00:44:36,805 --> 00:44:37,662
That's great.

393
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,217
The fact is this poor country pays us

394
00:44:41,268 --> 00:44:44,854
a lot of money to design war planes. Embrace the irony.

395
00:44:45,985 --> 00:44:48,944
I'm going to Tokyo tomorrow to get married.

396
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,150
Married?

397
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:53,648
To work hard at the office, you need a family at home.

398
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:57,634
More irony for you. Goodnight.

399
00:45:33,156 --> 00:45:36,915
These tight-fisted Germans aren't
letting us see any of Dr.Junker's work.

400
00:45:38,188 --> 00:45:39,188
I don't see any oxen.

401
00:45:39,491 --> 00:45:42,006
Jiro, the airstrip's right next to the plant.

402
00:45:42,398 --> 00:45:44,591
Wow, everything's so big.

403
00:46:06,632 --> 00:46:09,427
It's the G-38. Is this what we're buying?

404
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,411
Yep, to convert to a bomber.

405
00:46:13,475 --> 00:46:15,786
Who's the army planning to bomb with this one?

406
00:46:16,432 --> 00:46:19,336
America, probably. Not that they could.

407
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:23,247
This is something.

408
00:46:23,678 --> 00:46:24,820
It's amazing.

409
00:46:25,566 --> 00:46:29,539
Look. Passengers sit in the wings.
It would be a shame to put bombs there.

410
00:46:29,755 --> 00:46:34,235
That's the job, pal. This is our
chance to get the all-metal technology.

411
00:46:39,007 --> 00:46:40,806
What? They're not letting us in?

412
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:10,876
Beautiful.

413
00:47:18,424 --> 00:47:19,445
Take your hands off.

414
00:47:20,457 --> 00:47:22,926
You've been slamming doors on our faces all day.

415
00:47:23,252 --> 00:47:27,461
You Japanese copy everything. All
these technology belong to Germany.

416
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:31,093
Oh, I get it. So you're afraid we'll actually improve it!

417
00:47:31,384 --> 00:47:32,741
Honjo, let me talk to them.

418
00:47:33,321 --> 00:47:37,146
We have a license to your technology.

419
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:42,058
Therefore we officially have a right to
be in this hangar examining these airplanes.

420
00:47:42,195 --> 00:47:47,364
I understand you're just doing your job
but please understand I'm just doing mine.

421
00:47:48,126 --> 00:47:52,379
When I saw Dr.Junkers' single engine
plane, I had to get a closer look.

422
00:47:52,491 --> 00:47:56,637
I'm not a soldier, simply an engineer
admiring a fellow engineer's work.

423
00:47:57,129 --> 00:48:01,223
And as soldier, my orders are not
to leave you Japanese unattended.

424
00:48:19,487 --> 00:48:21,032
That's Dr. Junkers.

425
00:48:21,779 --> 00:48:22,858
What an engineer.

426
00:48:25,451 --> 00:48:28,285
Dr. Junkers gave you permission to go inside.

427
00:48:41,387 --> 00:48:43,488
So Jiro, what do you think?

428
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:45,889
There's more vibration than I expected.

429
00:48:46,897 --> 00:48:48,869
Our bosses are kids in a candy store.

430
00:48:49,191 --> 00:48:52,182
Hey, you two should let the army reps sit here, okay?

431
00:48:52,267 --> 00:48:52,879
Yes, sir.

432
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:58,068
Just one moment, please.

433
00:48:58,697 --> 00:49:01,085
It's fantastic, what a fortress.

434
00:49:03,188 --> 00:49:05,194
Look, you can walk through the wing.

435
00:49:07,618 --> 00:49:08,914
Amazing.

436
00:49:10,995 --> 00:49:13,096
It's like being inside a power plant.

437
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:21,523
Guten tag. We've permission to be here from Dr. Junkers.

438
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:23,785
Would you mind telling us a bit about your station.

439
00:49:23,903 --> 00:49:25,548
Here is the engineer's station.

440
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:27,876
It's such a marvelous aircraft.

441
00:49:30,006 --> 00:49:32,072
Young man, you can't go any further.

442
00:49:34,588 --> 00:49:35,947
We understand, my friend.

443
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:38,253
Are you seeing this?

444
00:49:38,514 --> 00:49:39,388
It's incredible.

445
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:44,082
A triumph of German industrial technology.

446
00:50:14,265 --> 00:50:18,520
Junkers let us in, the Germans
shut us out! These specs are useless!

447
00:50:20,755 --> 00:50:22,059
Jiro, give me a cigarette.

448
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:24,329
Jiro!

449
00:50:27,022 --> 00:50:28,008
Give me a smoke.

450
00:50:28,507 --> 00:50:29,089
We're out.

451
00:50:47,179 --> 00:50:50,386
It's cold outside but this room is quite cozy.

452
00:50:51,525 --> 00:50:54,259
You know that Junkers make these radiators too?

453
00:50:55,017 --> 00:50:59,496
Funny, they look just like his
planes with such strong parallel lines.

454
00:50:59,787 --> 00:51:00,353
Hmm...

455
00:51:00,369 --> 00:51:04,767
Okay, I get it. German's technology is so superior
that they can put wings on anything and fly it,

456
00:51:05,672 --> 00:51:07,494
Including their damn radiators.

457
00:51:07,755 --> 00:51:10,265
Jiro, would you just give it a rest, please.

458
00:51:11,482 --> 00:51:14,650
We can't learn anything from these government specs.

459
00:51:15,134 --> 00:51:17,637
They're nothing but a bunch of pretty numbers.

460
00:51:18,877 --> 00:51:21,482
"This technology belongs to Germany."

461
00:51:22,365 --> 00:51:25,605
Honjo, maybe we don't need their technology after all.

462
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:28,181
Wood and canvas could be just as good as metal.

463
00:51:28,666 --> 00:51:33,057
Jiro, we cannot be stuck in the past
forever. We're already 20 years behind!

464
00:51:38,124 --> 00:51:39,267
Let's get some air.

465
00:51:40,429 --> 00:51:42,422
My brain is going to explode.

466
00:51:51,438 --> 00:51:55,218
It's as if we were a hare chasing
a tortoise with a 20-year lead.

467
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:58,673
But in our little story, the hare doesn't sleep.

468
00:51:59,588 --> 00:52:02,719
We can close the gap but how could we beat it?

469
00:52:03,917 --> 00:52:06,078
We're too far behind. We'll always be chasing it.

470
00:52:06,492 --> 00:52:11,037
But what other choice do we have?
Keep running and catch up someday?

471
00:52:12,148 --> 00:52:14,874
I wonder if there's a different way to run.

472
00:52:21,969 --> 00:52:22,651
What is it?

473
00:52:26,625 --> 00:52:28,778
Schubert's "Winter Journey".

474
00:52:33,328 --> 00:52:36,969
Well, that's perfect for us. Masterpiece of misery memoir.

475
00:53:00,537 --> 00:53:01,450
What was that?

476
00:53:01,616 --> 00:53:04,015
Secret police. We saw them in the hangar.

477
00:54:03,749 --> 00:54:04,329
Jiro?

478
00:54:05,531 --> 00:54:08,170
Jiro, I'm done. The bath is yours.

479
00:54:13,031 --> 00:54:14,178
Dead to the world...

480
00:54:14,771 --> 00:54:18,308
Because he thinks he's shouldering
the future of Japanese aviation.

481
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:24,586
There's a telegram from headquarters.

482
00:54:24,757 --> 00:54:25,499
Come in.

483
00:54:25,665 --> 00:54:26,301
No need.

484
00:54:26,691 --> 00:54:30,725
Some of us will be returning to Japan
right away. You're staying here in Germany.

485
00:54:31,296 --> 00:54:33,484
Jiro will continue west and return to Japan.

486
00:54:34,342 --> 00:54:35,056
West?

487
00:54:35,342 --> 00:54:37,235
They want him to see the world.

488
00:54:37,739 --> 00:54:38,385
Alone?

489
00:55:05,662 --> 00:55:06,703
Mr. Caproni.

490
00:55:06,948 --> 00:55:08,790
Is the wind still rising?

491
00:55:10,032 --> 00:55:11,633
Yes sir, it sure is.

492
00:55:12,202 --> 00:55:16,112
Then it's a perfect time to
embark on my final flight. Join me.

493
00:55:16,674 --> 00:55:18,354
Wait, you're retiring?

494
00:55:20,147 --> 00:55:21,285
It's a pretty big jump.

495
00:55:25,684 --> 00:55:27,265
Come on, jump!

496
00:55:36,922 --> 00:55:39,660
Why are you sitting there? Let's go!.

497
00:55:40,265 --> 00:55:42,934
There's a hatch underneath the fuselage.

498
00:55:43,566 --> 00:55:44,722
Hurry up!

499
00:55:44,737 --> 00:55:45,420
Yes, sir.

500
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:47,129
Let him through, girls.

501
00:55:47,145 --> 00:55:47,629
Here!

502
00:55:56,365 --> 00:55:57,235
Come in!

503
00:56:06,373 --> 00:56:11,223
These are all my workers and their
families. Practically the whole village.

504
00:56:11,865 --> 00:56:16,458
I thought we take a little journey before
we deliver this bomber to the government.

505
00:56:23,511 --> 00:56:24,557
What do you think?

506
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:25,688
Incredible!

507
00:56:27,363 --> 00:56:29,791
It's like a building out of ancient Rome.

508
00:56:30,002 --> 00:56:32,634
This plane is too big to be used for fighting

509
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:35,985
but the military has a weakness for big things.

510
00:56:36,286 --> 00:56:42,865
Japan can never build anything as grand and as
beautiful as this. The country is too poor and backward.

511
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:45,679
Inspiration is more important than scale.

512
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:50,636
Inspiration unlocks the future.
Technology eventually catches up.

513
00:56:53,589 --> 00:56:54,665
That's my family.

514
00:56:55,661 --> 00:56:59,851
We Italians are very poor as
well. Too many mouths to feed.

515
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:09,375
Hey, settle down or the bottom will fall out.

516
00:57:10,534 --> 00:57:11,066
Come on.

517
00:57:15,205 --> 00:57:20,084
Be careful. This may be a dream
but you can still lose your head.

518
00:57:29,382 --> 00:57:34,058
Which would you choose, a world with pyramids or without?

519
00:57:34,982 --> 00:57:35,664
What do you mean?

520
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:40,992
Humanity has always dreamt of
flight, but the dream is cursed.

521
00:57:41,215 --> 00:57:45,839
My aircrafts are destined to become
tools for slaughter and destruction.

522
00:57:46,126 --> 00:57:46,720
I know.

523
00:57:47,492 --> 00:57:51,558
But still, I chose a world with pyramids in it.

524
00:57:52,633 --> 00:57:54,635
Which world will you choose?

525
00:57:55,254 --> 00:57:58,184
I just want to create beautiful airplanes.

526
00:57:58,454 --> 00:57:59,379
Like that?

527
00:58:15,272 --> 00:58:16,931
Very graceful.

528
00:58:17,593 --> 00:58:21,814
I have a long way to go. I don't
even have an engine or a cockpit yet.

529
00:58:30,837 --> 00:58:34,689
Bravo! A beautiful dream.

530
00:58:42,683 --> 00:58:44,928
This is my last design.

531
00:58:46,138 --> 00:58:49,756
Artists are only creative for ten years.

532
00:58:50,245 --> 00:58:52,877
We engineers are no different.

533
00:58:53,986 --> 00:58:57,866
Live your ten years well, Japanese boy.

534
00:59:14,697 --> 00:59:16,569
Jiro, let's go get some coffee.

535
00:59:16,842 --> 00:59:17,890
But I gotta go to a...

536
00:59:17,905 --> 00:59:18,467
Cancel it.

537
00:59:35,378 --> 00:59:37,002
This is a very tall order.

538
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:38,608
They're always tall.

539
00:59:39,092 --> 00:59:40,652
How long have you been here, Jiro?

540
00:59:42,718 --> 00:59:43,221
Jiro!

541
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,366
How long have you been here?

542
00:59:45,595 --> 00:59:46,381
Five years.

543
00:59:46,747 --> 00:59:50,093
Jiro, we're going to bid for
the Navy's carrier base fighter.

544
00:59:50,574 --> 00:59:53,817
We think we're ready to beat the Navy's chief designer.

545
00:59:54,152 --> 00:59:55,280
It's a plum job.

546
00:59:58,551 --> 00:59:59,939
It's a plum job!

547
01:00:11,877 --> 01:00:12,796
What do you think?

548
01:00:13,456 --> 01:00:14,519
Leave it to me, sir.

549
01:00:14,971 --> 01:00:15,379
Good.

550
01:00:16,286 --> 01:00:18,048
I'd like Honjo on the team, sir.

551
01:00:18,428 --> 01:00:19,397
Not a good idea.

552
01:00:19,834 --> 01:00:23,312
You'd just end up competing.
Friendships are always more important.

553
01:00:23,801 --> 01:00:25,514
Relax, finish your coffee.

554
01:00:26,595 --> 01:00:28,340
My check, please. Kurokawa.

555
01:00:28,581 --> 01:00:31,149
We've got other plans for your friend Honjo.

556
01:01:18,166 --> 01:01:19,982
Damn these Japanese engines!

557
01:01:30,517 --> 01:01:33,151
Damn these short runways.

558
01:01:37,571 --> 01:01:39,125
I brought some clean uniforms.

559
01:01:39,643 --> 01:01:40,991
Oh, thank you very much.

560
01:01:53,307 --> 01:01:54,927
These are fit uniforms.

561
01:01:54,953 --> 01:01:56,309
Yes, we are ready.

562
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,934
Man overboard!

563
01:03:17,791 --> 01:03:18,950
Stop!

564
01:04:21,829 --> 01:04:22,470
Whoa!

565
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:31,083
Father!

566
01:06:17,755 --> 01:06:21,455
Bravo! That was a nice catch.

567
01:06:25,888 --> 01:06:28,298
It nearly took you away. Are you all right?

568
01:06:28,314 --> 01:06:28,889
I'm fine.

569
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,226
Thank you. I'll make sure that it stays grounded.

570
01:06:33,429 --> 01:06:34,002
Yes, sir.

571
01:06:48,011 --> 01:06:50,757
I feel bad. I wanted to say thank you.

572
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,314
Nice young man. Don't worry.

573
01:06:53,506 --> 01:06:56,442
He's staying at our hotel. You'll
have a chance to say thank you.

574
01:09:41,507 --> 01:09:42,387
What is it, dear?

575
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:46,633
There's something about that man who caught the parasol.

576
01:09:46,893 --> 01:09:49,723
Oh, he seems to be here by himself.

577
01:11:01,129 --> 01:11:02,790
I'm very sorry.

578
01:11:04,854 --> 01:11:09,008
Please don't go. I was giving thanks to the spring.

579
01:11:09,613 --> 01:11:13,382
I asked it to bring you here.
I asked it to bring you to me.

580
01:11:16,897 --> 01:11:21,345
You haven't changed at all from that
day years ago. You look just the same.

581
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:25,636
We were so grateful for your help after the earthquake.

582
01:11:26,335 --> 01:11:28,823
I wanted to see you again and thank you.

583
01:11:29,394 --> 01:11:31,199
Oh, I remember.

584
01:11:32,143 --> 01:11:33,820
My name is Nahoko Satomi.

585
01:11:35,663 --> 01:11:36,987
I'm Jiro Horikoshi.

586
01:11:58,858 --> 01:12:01,394
This umbrella is useless. Are you alright?

587
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:02,564
Oh, I'm fine.

588
01:12:03,905 --> 01:12:08,602
Kinu searched for you for years. Then
she found you just before she got married.

589
01:12:09,879 --> 01:12:12,541
She cried with joy after she dropped off your shirt.

590
01:12:13,025 --> 01:12:15,939
You see, you were our knight in shining armor.

591
01:12:16,204 --> 01:12:17,117
Your knight?

592
01:12:17,274 --> 01:12:20,398
Yes, I think I remember you were on a white horse.

593
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,219
Well, I'm not doing much now to keep you dry.

594
01:12:24,125 --> 01:12:24,998
It's okay.

595
01:12:25,314 --> 01:12:26,673
I don't mind at all.

596
01:12:27,682 --> 01:12:30,535
Kinu will be so excited when I tell her.

597
01:12:31,392 --> 01:12:32,910
I found our hero again.

598
01:12:36,835 --> 01:12:38,480
Oh, your painting is ruined.

599
01:12:38,736 --> 01:12:42,285
No, it's not. I'll always
remember this day when I look at it.

600
01:12:42,529 --> 01:12:44,129
Well, look, it's clearing up.

601
01:12:51,475 --> 01:12:53,290
It's like another land!

602
01:12:54,947 --> 01:12:57,090
Oh, Jiro, look!

603
01:13:04,618 --> 01:13:06,886
I almost forgot what rainbows look like.

604
01:13:07,626 --> 01:13:09,338
Life is wonderful, isn't it?

605
01:13:11,012 --> 01:13:14,138
Oh, we should go. My father's probably worried sick.

606
01:13:19,004 --> 01:13:20,033
There he is.

607
01:13:20,504 --> 01:13:22,078
Father!

608
01:13:23,016 --> 01:13:25,798
Come with me. I would really love to introduce you.

609
01:13:25,876 --> 01:13:26,441
Of course.

610
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,418
You're soaking wet.

611
01:13:30,444 --> 01:13:35,215
No, no, I'm fine. I was just with
Mr. Horikoshi, he saved me again.

612
01:13:35,797 --> 01:13:36,670
Jiro Horikoshi.

613
01:13:37,144 --> 01:13:41,193
I'm Satomi. It's so very good to meet you, Mr. Horikoshi.

614
01:14:27,325 --> 01:14:28,548
May I sit here?

615
01:14:30,663 --> 01:14:31,340
Certainly.

616
01:14:48,957 --> 01:14:52,998
German tobacco. I've been saving it. Last one.

617
01:14:53,694 --> 01:14:57,949
I understand. Japanese cigarette
always taste like home to me.

618
01:14:58,626 --> 01:15:03,178
You must've visited Germany, yes? Perhaps to Dessau?

619
01:15:03,847 --> 01:15:06,407
Oh, you must be Sherlock Holmes.

620
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:08,322
You read magazines.

621
01:15:08,995 --> 01:15:17,359
German magazines about airplanes. All Japanese
engineers visit Dessau. It's elementary. My dear Watson.

622
01:15:20,017 --> 01:15:20,945
You cracked the case.

623
01:15:22,635 --> 01:15:24,815
Dr. Junkers is in trouble.

624
01:15:25,599 --> 01:15:26,401
In trouble?

625
01:15:28,625 --> 01:15:32,580
He fights the hand that feeds him and he will lose.

626
01:15:32,954 --> 01:15:34,701
He fights Mr. Hitler's government?

627
01:15:35,339 --> 01:15:38,061
The Nazis are a gang of hoodlums.

628
01:15:38,818 --> 01:15:40,921
This is quite a good place.

629
01:15:41,185 --> 01:15:45,425
No mosquitoes. Not too hot. Good watercress.

630
01:15:45,714 --> 01:15:48,731
A good place to forget bad things. Isn't that right?

631
01:15:49,247 --> 01:15:51,600
Cigarette? I'm afraid they're Japanese.

632
01:15:51,642 --> 01:15:52,451
Thank you.

633
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:02,341
It is a nice night. "Hier ist der zauberberg."

634
01:16:02,634 --> 01:16:04,480
"The Magic Mountain" by Thomas Mann?

635
01:16:04,716 --> 01:16:07,260
Yes, a good place for forgetting.

636
01:16:07,838 --> 01:16:10,578
Make a war in China. Forget it.

637
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:14,116
Make a puppet state in Manchuria. Forget it.

638
01:16:14,452 --> 01:16:17,007
Quit the league of nations. Forget it.

639
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:20,224
Make the world your enemy. Forget it.

640
01:16:20,685 --> 01:16:22,346
Japan will blow up.

641
01:16:23,632 --> 01:16:25,277
Germany will blow up too.

642
01:16:26,207 --> 01:16:28,258
Do you think Germany will go to war again?

643
01:16:28,416 --> 01:16:30,585
Yes. They must be stopped.

644
01:16:32,556 --> 01:16:34,574
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

645
01:16:35,368 --> 01:16:37,060
Naoko has a fever.

646
01:16:37,785 --> 01:16:40,183
We'll have to cancel our dinner plans.

647
01:16:40,911 --> 01:16:44,274
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I
hope that she feels better soon.

648
01:16:45,035 --> 01:16:47,554
The doctor will be here soon. I must go.

649
01:18:44,605 --> 01:18:46,086
"Who has seen the wind?"

650
01:18:47,942 --> 01:18:49,246
"Neither I nor you."

651
01:18:51,087 --> 01:18:56,062
"But when the leaves hang trembling,
the wind is passing through."

652
01:19:00,274 --> 01:19:02,518
Let the wind carry these wings,

653
01:19:03,808 --> 01:19:05,717
carry these wings to you.

654
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:42,986
Jiro?

655
01:19:43,962 --> 01:19:44,615
Naoko!

656
01:20:05,362 --> 01:20:06,558
Be careful!

657
01:22:06,502 --> 01:22:07,656
Nice catch.

658
01:23:23,537 --> 01:23:25,245
Bravo! Bravo!

659
01:23:25,261 --> 01:23:27,365
Well, is your daughter feeling better?

660
01:23:28,051 --> 01:23:29,582
Yes, thank you, much better.

661
01:23:30,231 --> 01:23:31,187
Wonderful.

662
01:23:31,917 --> 01:23:35,453
This is the magic mountain. It cures everyone.

663
01:23:36,056 --> 01:23:37,090
I think you're right.

664
01:23:38,176 --> 01:23:41,901
At the beginning, this young man was very gloomy.

665
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:44,548
Now he is very happy

666
01:23:44,922 --> 01:23:46,813
because he's in love.

667
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:48,321
Yes.

668
01:23:50,115 --> 01:23:52,481
But summer love is seasonal.

669
01:23:52,978 --> 01:23:56,612
You will go down the mountain and forget all about it.

670
01:23:57,244 --> 01:23:58,176
That's not true.

671
01:23:59,632 --> 01:24:03,624
This love of yours, it wouldn't
be about my daughter, right?

672
01:24:03,774 --> 01:24:05,894
Yes sir, I love her very much.

673
01:24:07,326 --> 01:24:10,011
And I sincerely hope you'll approve, Mr. Satomi.

674
01:24:10,616 --> 01:24:13,987
Well, I don't, uh... Father!

675
01:24:15,463 --> 01:24:18,120
I would very much like to have your approval too.

676
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:20,335
Now, there's a beauty.

677
01:24:23,708 --> 01:24:27,057
But Jiro, there's something I need you to understand.

678
01:24:27,258 --> 01:24:27,819
Anything.

679
01:24:28,164 --> 01:24:31,839
My mother died of tuberculosis two years ago.

680
01:24:32,437 --> 01:24:34,772
And now I have it too.

681
01:24:35,672 --> 01:24:39,758
Naoko, I'm in love with you.
Nothing ever going to stop me.

682
01:24:40,588 --> 01:24:44,165
I've loved you since the day the wind brought you to me.

683
01:24:45,118 --> 01:24:46,477
Will you please marry me.

684
01:24:46,964 --> 01:24:47,596
Yes.

685
01:24:48,183 --> 01:24:52,276
But I first I'm gonna get well.
Will you please wait for me?

686
01:24:52,473 --> 01:24:55,539
I'll, even if it's gonna take a hundred years.

687
01:24:55,973 --> 01:24:57,448
Congratulations.

688
01:24:57,597 --> 01:25:01,674
He is a nice young man and your daughter is wonderful.

689
01:25:02,986 --> 01:25:05,799
This is a summer to remember.

690
01:25:28,406 --> 01:25:29,953
If it isn't the long lost Jiro!

691
01:25:30,389 --> 01:25:31,223
Honjo!

692
01:25:31,596 --> 01:25:32,447
When did you get back?

693
01:25:32,796 --> 01:25:33,415
Two days ago.

694
01:25:33,856 --> 01:25:34,833
Hot, isn't it?

695
01:25:38,171 --> 01:25:40,127
Come, take a look at this.

696
01:25:44,550 --> 01:25:45,822
She's beautiful.

697
01:25:46,663 --> 01:25:47,968
Good clean lines.

698
01:25:51,955 --> 01:25:54,832
They gave me free rein, so I designed something radical.

699
01:25:55,268 --> 01:25:58,225
But it won't mount to anything if she doesn't fly.

700
01:25:59,764 --> 01:26:03,150
Oh, I'm sure she'll fly. I feel the wind rising.

701
01:26:23,994 --> 01:26:28,090
Honjo, you've closed the gap and in one huge step.

702
01:26:28,871 --> 01:26:30,768
My plane was just a tin duckling.

703
01:26:31,104 --> 01:26:32,635
But here's an idea for you.

704
01:26:33,248 --> 01:26:35,614
I thought of it too late to implement on my plane.

705
01:26:38,072 --> 01:26:44,498
It's a way to reduce drag by using Flathead
screws on all the access hatches and the fueling port.

706
01:26:45,538 --> 01:26:48,745
Maintenance will be easy with a hinge on one side.

707
01:26:52,422 --> 01:26:55,237
I think a spring of this diameter should be fine.

708
01:26:55,606 --> 01:26:59,390
Jiro, that's it! What a great idea, as usual.

709
01:26:59,704 --> 01:27:00,512
You should use it.

710
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:03,236
Thanks pal, but not this time.

711
01:27:05,130 --> 01:27:10,070
I'll keep these but I won't use them before
you. Your idea belongs in your next plane.

712
01:27:11,152 --> 01:27:11,945
Thanks, Honjo.

713
01:27:12,826 --> 01:27:15,033
You're welcome. You better hurry up.

714
01:27:15,704 --> 01:27:17,460
Jiro! Where are you?

715
01:27:18,278 --> 01:27:19,192
Mr. Kurokawa.

716
01:27:20,031 --> 01:27:20,661
Jiro.

717
01:27:20,678 --> 01:27:22,065
Get back to the office!

718
01:27:22,259 --> 01:27:23,543
Thanks. I'm coming!

719
01:27:23,559 --> 01:27:25,107
Come to the house for a drink next time.

720
01:27:25,246 --> 01:27:25,651
Sure!

721
01:27:25,929 --> 01:27:26,982
Jiro, you pedal.

722
01:27:32,428 --> 01:27:34,432
The secret police are looking for you.

723
01:27:35,036 --> 01:27:35,413
What?

724
01:27:35,725 --> 01:27:38,368
Did you hear me? The fight crime boys.

725
01:27:38,969 --> 01:27:39,807
But why me?

726
01:27:39,823 --> 01:27:42,739
Didn't ask. I told them you were away.

727
01:27:53,671 --> 01:27:56,735
They're just pretending to leave. We won't fall for that.

728
01:27:57,187 --> 01:27:59,110
You work up here today. I've arranged it.

729
01:27:59,489 --> 01:28:02,547
But why would they possibly
be after me? I don't understand.

730
01:28:02,768 --> 01:28:07,796
They've already arrested some of my
friends. None of them understood why.

731
01:28:09,713 --> 01:28:10,208
Enter.

732
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:11,486
Here's your stuff.

733
01:28:14,152 --> 01:28:15,546
I think we got everything.

734
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:17,483
I can go back and check.

735
01:28:17,851 --> 01:28:19,070
Nah, just leave it and go.

736
01:28:19,391 --> 01:28:20,713
Jiro, the flange is here!

737
01:28:20,738 --> 01:28:21,798
Can't wait to see it!

738
01:28:33,211 --> 01:28:34,100
It's perfect.

739
01:28:34,188 --> 01:28:36,324
Sure is. I wish we had that a year ago.

740
01:28:36,926 --> 01:28:38,293
So, what do you think, Jiro?

741
01:28:38,692 --> 01:28:42,632
Our next plane won't just be a
duckling, it'll be a full-grown duck.

742
01:28:44,261 --> 01:28:45,930
A full metal duck.

743
01:28:46,026 --> 01:28:47,645
Mr. Kurokawa, what do you think?

744
01:28:48,205 --> 01:28:52,030
I hope you youngsters appreciate
the luxury of extruded aluminum alloy.

745
01:28:52,292 --> 01:28:53,874
That's it, now back to work!

746
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:07,252
Alright, the coast looks clear.

747
01:29:07,406 --> 01:29:08,498
Okay, Jiro.

748
01:29:10,234 --> 01:29:13,517
You should keep a low profile
for a few days, just in case.

749
01:29:13,533 --> 01:29:15,217
We'll try to smooth things over.

750
01:29:15,310 --> 01:29:17,249
I'll put you up at my house.

751
01:29:17,265 --> 01:29:20,237
Can we stop at my apartment first? I've to check my mail.

752
01:29:20,967 --> 01:29:22,821
Is it sensitive?

753
01:29:22,943 --> 01:29:24,482
Yes, it's very sensitive.

754
01:29:24,583 --> 01:29:26,722
The police will be opening all your mail.

755
01:29:27,015 --> 01:29:28,247
It's from my fiancée.

756
01:29:28,568 --> 01:29:31,703
This is outrageous. These things
shouldn't happen in a modern country.

757
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:35,372
You're engaged?

758
01:29:36,336 --> 01:29:37,994
You're a human after all.

759
01:29:38,561 --> 01:29:40,441
I thought you would marry an airplane!

760
01:29:40,738 --> 01:29:42,459
I don't find that very funny!

761
01:29:42,676 --> 01:29:45,987
Of course it's not funny. The police
are waiting for you at your apartment.

762
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:48,394
If they want to read your love letters, let them!

763
01:29:48,962 --> 01:29:51,906
Jiro, we need you to focus on the fighter project.

764
01:29:52,386 --> 01:29:57,157
That's why we sent you away to rest after the
crash. The company will do everything to protect you.

765
01:29:57,445 --> 01:29:59,221
If you keep your mind in your work.

766
01:30:01,335 --> 01:30:03,157
I can't bear being apart from you.

767
01:30:04,192 --> 01:30:08,543
Why do you suppose the police are looking
for Mr. Castorp? He left so suddenly.

768
01:30:20,153 --> 01:30:23,672
I pray everyday that he managed to leave Japan safely.

769
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:44,214
Jiro, you've a telephone call.

770
01:30:46,243 --> 01:30:47,309
The telephone is over there.

771
01:30:47,403 --> 01:30:48,632
Thank you, Mrs. Kurokawa.

772
01:30:51,313 --> 01:30:51,837
Hello?

773
01:30:51,945 --> 01:30:54,828
Jiro? It's me. You have a telegram.

774
01:30:54,853 --> 01:30:55,456
Yes?

775
01:30:55,707 --> 01:31:00,032
Your landlord received it two days
ago. We just brought it in here now.

776
01:31:00,606 --> 01:31:01,783
Would you please read it to me?

777
01:31:02,265 --> 01:31:02,886
Now?

778
01:31:02,901 --> 01:31:03,338
Yes.

779
01:31:05,383 --> 01:31:10,353
"Nahoko... has had a lung... heh, heh...

780
01:31:10,642 --> 01:31:12,889
Hemorrhage. Satomi."

781
01:31:19,681 --> 01:31:21,930
Jiro? Are you still there?

782
01:31:22,207 --> 01:31:24,343
Thank you. I've to go now.

783
01:31:24,915 --> 01:31:26,046
Jiro, wait!

784
01:31:28,730 --> 01:31:29,405
What is it?

785
01:31:30,835 --> 01:31:33,910
Mrs. Kurokawa, please, I need to
know the quickest way to get to Tokyo!

786
01:31:34,236 --> 01:31:35,669
Tokyo? Today?

787
01:31:35,788 --> 01:31:38,264
Yes, it's an emergency. I have
to be there as soon as possible.

788
01:31:38,756 --> 01:31:39,494
Alright.

789
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:44,431
If you take the noon bus, then you'll
just be able to catch the express.

790
01:31:44,506 --> 01:31:47,425
I'll send someone to hold the
bus for you. Go get your things.

791
01:31:47,441 --> 01:31:47,965
Thank you.

792
01:31:48,471 --> 01:31:48,974
Jiya!

793
01:33:37,039 --> 01:33:38,023
Darling!

794
01:33:48,036 --> 01:33:49,567
I'm sorry I wasn't here sooner.

795
01:33:55,928 --> 01:33:56,884
You'll catch it.

796
01:33:57,512 --> 01:33:58,440
You're beautiful.

797
01:33:59,824 --> 01:34:00,502
I love you.

798
01:34:03,526 --> 01:34:04,976
Jiro? Through the garden?

799
01:34:14,806 --> 01:34:15,723
Come in, father.

800
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:20,429
Look, look who's here? Jiro.

801
01:34:20,734 --> 01:34:23,567
He came all the way from Nagoya but can't stay for long.

802
01:34:23,833 --> 01:34:26,514
I'll be sure to use the front door the next time I come.

803
01:34:26,529 --> 01:34:28,206
Weill, the garden, it's faster.

804
01:34:28,743 --> 01:34:30,248
Okay, garden it is.

805
01:34:30,681 --> 01:34:32,560
Take care, my darling.

806
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:34,143
Sleep well.

807
01:34:35,968 --> 01:34:36,738
Goodnight, sir.

808
01:34:37,431 --> 01:34:38,182
I'll see you out.

809
01:34:44,210 --> 01:34:46,326
You better hurry if you gonna catch the last train.

810
01:34:48,431 --> 01:34:52,998
I wish I could look after her,
Mr. Satomi. She seems so tired.

811
01:34:53,014 --> 01:34:56,349
The last thing Naoko wants is to be a burden to you.

812
01:34:56,691 --> 01:34:57,386
You better go.

813
01:35:05,557 --> 01:35:06,196
Naoko?

814
01:35:08,488 --> 01:35:09,363
Are you alright?

815
01:35:12,883 --> 01:35:17,171
I'm going to the sanatorium in the
mountain, the one the doctor recommended.

816
01:35:17,730 --> 01:35:21,112
But why? It's so far and I don't want you to be alone.

817
01:35:21,612 --> 01:35:23,630
Because I want to get better, father.

818
01:35:23,724 --> 01:35:25,474
I want to have a life with Jiro.

819
01:35:31,368 --> 01:35:33,300
Just made it. The whole board is waiting.

820
01:35:41,918 --> 01:35:43,439
So, are you ready?

821
01:35:44,071 --> 01:35:45,549
Gentleman, I'll do my best.

822
01:35:45,930 --> 01:35:48,567
Now you'll see the Navy. They're the client.

823
01:35:59,683 --> 01:36:01,123
Gentleman, I'll do my best.

824
01:36:01,359 --> 01:36:02,854
You weren't even listening.

825
01:36:03,368 --> 01:36:03,936
Nope.

826
01:36:06,388 --> 01:36:08,343
So I gave up on that idea.

827
01:36:10,743 --> 01:36:11,767
Very well, they're late.

828
01:36:11,782 --> 01:36:14,562
Jiro's in the middle of a review with the design team.

829
01:36:16,879 --> 01:36:20,429
I wanted this design to use
the latest aeronautical advances.

830
01:36:20,653 --> 01:36:21,249
Take a look.

831
01:36:22,031 --> 01:36:23,687
Retractable undercarriage!

832
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:26,402
It's built to reach 270 knots.

833
01:36:26,418 --> 01:36:29,874
270 knots? That's 500 kilometers per hour!

834
01:36:30,006 --> 01:36:32,679
But the Navy only asked for 220 knots.

835
01:36:32,819 --> 01:36:35,230
220 will be obsolete by next week.

836
01:36:35,718 --> 01:36:38,519
The wing load is 120 kilos per square meter.

837
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:40,819
Minimal drag will be the key.

838
01:36:41,725 --> 01:36:46,981
I pushed the design to the limit of technology,
with split flaps and slats on the leading edges.

839
01:37:08,425 --> 01:37:10,427
But the weight becomes the big problem.

840
01:37:13,740 --> 01:37:16,713
One solution would be, we could leave out the guns.

841
01:37:23,067 --> 01:37:25,948
So, I decided to put this design back on the shelf.

842
01:37:27,255 --> 01:37:29,229
This is refreshing, delightful.

843
01:37:29,518 --> 01:37:30,868
He nearly had it.

844
01:37:31,426 --> 01:37:36,633
But we're not giving up because our engines are
underpowered. We'll build a light, strong air frame.

845
01:37:37,173 --> 01:37:41,479
We'll cut every ounce of excess weight
and minimize drag with a smooth skin.

846
01:37:41,931 --> 01:37:45,769
We're going to build an all-metal fighter,
like nothing the world has ever seen!

847
01:37:48,482 --> 01:37:49,934
Mr. Hirayama, please.

848
01:37:51,317 --> 01:37:54,136
This is Mr. Hirayama, he's our production engineer.

849
01:37:54,844 --> 01:37:55,548
Thank you, sir.

850
01:37:58,012 --> 01:38:00,625
He's going to tell us about the
new rivets that he's developing.

851
01:38:01,564 --> 01:38:06,946
I believe it's technically possible to match the strength
of conventional rivets with rivets that are flushed.

852
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:08,463
What's he talking about?

853
01:38:08,954 --> 01:38:10,687
A new way to cut drag.

854
01:38:10,825 --> 01:38:16,295
We're going to skin the entire plane with
flushed rivets to produce a nimble, fast aircraft.

855
01:38:21,194 --> 01:38:23,748
I must say, that was interesting.

856
01:38:23,859 --> 01:38:25,518
It was inspiring.

857
01:38:45,718 --> 01:38:47,486
Miss Satomi, today's letter.

858
01:38:47,985 --> 01:38:48,820
Thank you.

859
01:40:09,161 --> 01:40:10,378
Chief, you've a phone call.

860
01:40:11,116 --> 01:40:12,404
I'll have to call him back.

861
01:40:12,482 --> 01:40:13,848
I think it's an emergency.

862
01:40:13,984 --> 01:40:16,525
Hello, Mr. Satomi. Good to hear from you, sir.

863
01:40:17,265 --> 01:40:19,329
Yes, yes, what?

864
01:41:32,403 --> 01:41:33,180
Jiro!

865
01:41:33,753 --> 01:41:34,653
I'm here now.

866
01:41:34,669 --> 01:41:35,389
Jiro!

867
01:41:36,284 --> 01:41:36,857
I'm here.

868
01:41:40,044 --> 01:41:42,586
You alright, my love? Can you walk?

869
01:41:44,318 --> 01:41:44,817
Come.

870
01:41:52,259 --> 01:41:55,313
I've to go back. I just needed to see you.

871
01:41:55,410 --> 01:41:56,455
No, don't go back.

872
01:41:59,685 --> 01:42:00,629
We should be together.

873
01:42:14,451 --> 01:42:16,091
Oh, you must be Naoko.

874
01:42:16,170 --> 01:42:17,290
Please to meet you.

875
01:42:17,576 --> 01:42:18,951
I'm so glad you're here.

876
01:42:18,982 --> 01:42:19,601
Jiro.

877
01:42:20,308 --> 01:42:22,302
Mr. Kurokawa, we've a request.

878
01:42:23,384 --> 01:42:25,218
We've plenty of room, dear.

879
01:42:25,625 --> 01:42:27,325
I know we've the room,

880
01:42:27,388 --> 01:42:32,551
That's not the problem. I simply can't approve
an unmarried couple living under this roof.

881
01:42:33,020 --> 01:42:34,394
Then we'll marry tonight.

882
01:42:34,599 --> 01:42:37,883
Mr. Kurokawa, Mrs. Kurokawa,
will you please be our witnesses.

883
01:42:38,103 --> 01:42:39,463
What? Tonight?

884
01:42:39,723 --> 01:42:41,574
Of course we'll, dear.

885
01:42:41,671 --> 01:42:44,579
Naoko traveled all this way, it's the least we can do.

886
01:42:45,492 --> 01:42:49,648
My doctors know about this and
my father has given his blessing.

887
01:42:49,759 --> 01:42:50,767
Please, help us.

888
01:42:53,729 --> 01:42:56,706
The bride and I have a lot of work to do, and so do you.

889
01:42:57,534 --> 01:42:58,381
Come, Naoko.

890
01:43:04,718 --> 01:43:07,180
Oh, don't mind him, he's always like that.

891
01:43:11,487 --> 01:43:15,902
If you care about her at all, Jiro,
you'll send her back on the morning train.

892
01:43:17,069 --> 01:43:21,548
I'll have to give up the fighter project,
Mr. Kurokawa, because I would go with her.

893
01:43:21,895 --> 01:43:24,745
Is that your heart or your ego talking?

894
01:43:26,001 --> 01:43:29,354
Naoko doesn't have much time. We've made our decision.

895
01:43:30,736 --> 01:43:31,426
I see.

896
01:43:32,714 --> 01:43:35,160
All right. So I guess it's on with wedding!

897
01:44:00,054 --> 01:44:00,768
Here they come.

898
01:44:02,718 --> 01:44:03,530
She's coming!

899
01:44:23,058 --> 01:44:29,915
Hear me! I bring to you a lovely maiden who has
come from the mountains to be with her beloved.

900
01:44:30,304 --> 01:44:33,633
She has given up everything for him. What say you?

901
01:44:34,316 --> 01:44:40,386
Hear me! The man I present is an insensitive
charcoal head without even a home to call his own.

902
01:44:40,672 --> 01:44:43,341
But if that's what she wants, she can come in.

903
01:44:43,606 --> 01:44:46,785
And then, they shall exchange the sacred vows.

904
01:45:09,517 --> 01:45:10,560
You're beautiful.

905
01:45:47,611 --> 01:45:49,775
Mr. Kurokawa, Mrs. Kurokawa.

906
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:55,898
All Jiro and I've in this world is each other,
I cannot thank you enough for your kindness.

907
01:45:56,126 --> 01:45:58,131
We will never forget our debt to you.

908
01:46:00,456 --> 01:46:05,471
Nonsense, there's absolutely no debt to repay.
We're both so happy that you've found each other.

909
01:46:05,803 --> 01:46:06,736
Aren't we, dear?

910
01:46:06,774 --> 01:46:10,746
Um... hmm, you both are very, very brave!

911
01:46:26,730 --> 01:46:27,997
You must be exhausted.

912
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:32,563
I feel like I'm in a wonderful
dream. Feel like the room is spinning.

913
01:46:32,579 --> 01:46:34,955
Then you should try to get some rest.

914
01:46:36,222 --> 01:46:37,021
Come here.

915
01:46:37,835 --> 01:46:38,461
Are you sure?

916
01:46:41,142 --> 01:46:42,104
Come here.

917
01:47:23,465 --> 01:47:24,102
Kayo!

918
01:47:24,149 --> 01:47:26,755
You're going to tell me you
completely forgotten I was coming?

919
01:47:27,024 --> 01:47:28,923
Yes, I completely forgot you were coming.

920
01:47:28,939 --> 01:47:30,623
You're so insensitive.

921
01:47:32,371 --> 01:47:34,689
Congratulations on finishing medical school.

922
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:37,543
Congratulations on your marriage to Naoko.

923
01:47:38,122 --> 01:47:42,103
I've come to thank Mr. and Mrs.
Kurokawa on behalf of the entire family.

924
01:47:42,119 --> 01:47:43,160
Are they still up?

925
01:47:43,647 --> 01:47:44,693
They've gone to bed.

926
01:47:44,907 --> 01:47:46,592
So, you've met Naoko?

927
01:47:46,607 --> 01:47:47,050
Yes.

928
01:47:51,389 --> 01:47:56,116
Jiro, what're you going to do?
She's alone in that room all day.

929
01:47:57,055 --> 01:47:59,464
You won't know it because you come home so late!

930
01:48:00,232 --> 01:48:03,209
Do you know she puts rouge on
her cheek so that you won't worry?

931
01:48:03,807 --> 01:48:06,758
Naoko condition is much worse than you think, Jiro.

932
01:48:06,773 --> 01:48:09,005
I know because at school I watched these people...

933
01:48:10,626 --> 01:48:13,985
She's my sister now. I really like her.

934
01:48:14,285 --> 01:48:15,948
How can you do this to her?

935
01:48:21,008 --> 01:48:23,162
Does Naoko really have to stay here?

936
01:48:23,484 --> 01:48:23,995
Yes.

937
01:48:25,542 --> 01:48:29,588
She does because each day
together is very precious to us now.

938
01:48:32,302 --> 01:48:36,651
Get some rest. We can talk more in
the morning. I'm glad you're here.

939
01:48:50,641 --> 01:48:51,475
I'm home.

940
01:48:51,568 --> 01:48:53,060
I must have dozed off.

941
01:48:53,075 --> 01:48:53,845
Go back to sleep.

942
01:49:00,589 --> 01:49:01,292
Thank you.

943
01:49:01,584 --> 01:49:02,871
Did you see your sister?

944
01:49:03,095 --> 01:49:03,696
Yes.

945
01:49:04,621 --> 01:49:05,945
I like her a lot.

946
01:49:06,926 --> 01:49:11,308
So confident and strong. She has
got such a bright future ahead of her.

947
01:49:12,588 --> 01:49:15,376
I told her I wanted her to be my doctor.

948
01:49:18,728 --> 01:49:22,285
She brought me a gift from your
mother, this nightgown and robe.

949
01:49:22,806 --> 01:49:24,247
See, she made it for me.

950
01:49:25,794 --> 01:49:26,836
Is that too bright?

951
01:49:27,469 --> 01:49:28,886
No, it's fine.

952
01:49:31,061 --> 01:49:33,224
I have to finish the design by tomorrow.

953
01:49:33,635 --> 01:49:34,943
Your mackerel bones?

954
01:49:35,835 --> 01:49:36,918
You remembered.

955
01:49:37,477 --> 01:49:40,242
I think I may have a way to make it a bit lighter.

956
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:44,514
Come a little closer.

957
01:49:54,098 --> 01:49:55,336
Give me your hand.

958
01:49:58,684 --> 01:50:02,515
This is nice. I really like looking
at you while you're working, Jiro.

959
01:50:03,505 --> 01:50:08,490
On a contest for one-handed slide
ruler users, I'd win first prize for sure.

960
01:50:09,472 --> 01:50:12,581
Look at that, I can make each rib half an ounce lighter.

961
01:50:12,697 --> 01:50:14,337
You can? That's good.

962
01:50:14,525 --> 01:50:16,711
Thirty ribs, that almost make a pound.

963
01:50:16,995 --> 01:50:18,429
See, I knew it.

964
01:50:19,004 --> 01:50:21,390
You were better when you're holding my hand.

965
01:50:22,016 --> 01:50:26,328
You're right. If only I could leave
my hand right here for a test-flight.

966
01:50:32,126 --> 01:50:34,122
You my dear, should get some sleep.

967
01:50:34,426 --> 01:50:35,336
Don't let go.

968
01:50:36,429 --> 01:50:37,479
No, I won't let go.

969
01:50:41,202 --> 01:50:44,583
I need a cigarette. Can I let go for a minute?

970
01:50:45,130 --> 01:50:46,878
No, smoke here.

971
01:50:48,651 --> 01:50:49,905
It's not good for you.

972
01:50:50,171 --> 01:50:51,231
I don't care.

973
01:51:08,212 --> 01:51:09,337
Hey, Honjo.

974
01:51:09,659 --> 01:51:10,767
Can I take a look?

975
01:51:10,827 --> 01:51:13,617
Sure. I hear good things about your heavy bomber.

976
01:51:13,688 --> 01:51:14,816
Ah, it's not bad.

977
01:51:15,268 --> 01:51:18,359
Jiro, she's beautiful.

978
01:51:22,163 --> 01:51:23,993
The infamous flush riveting.

979
01:51:25,611 --> 01:51:26,750
Feels a little rough.

980
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:30,127
Yea, we're still learning how to do it.

981
01:51:30,806 --> 01:51:36,591
Well, you'll get it. You already left the
Germans behind. I'm still stuck with them.

982
01:51:37,521 --> 01:51:42,186
This design is classic Jiro,
right down to the mackerel bones.

983
01:51:44,361 --> 01:51:49,344
Jiro, is it alright if I use your
flush rivets and that spring-loaded hatch.

984
01:51:49,517 --> 01:51:51,133
Um hmm, of course.

985
01:51:51,793 --> 01:51:52,778
Sketched a redesign?

986
01:51:52,892 --> 01:51:56,948
Yeah, I wanted to redo the whole thing
but they only let me touch the fuselage.

987
01:51:57,667 --> 01:51:59,142
But, what about the wings?

988
01:51:59,215 --> 01:52:02,397
That's what keeps me up at night.
The wings still carry all the fuel

989
01:52:02,979 --> 01:52:06,562
and I can't shield them because
she has to fly over 1,800 miles.

990
01:52:06,867 --> 01:52:10,691
It's already too heavy. We
can't even add an ounce of weight.

991
01:52:12,723 --> 01:52:16,318
So without a redesign, Japan's first advance bomber

992
01:52:17,218 --> 01:52:20,393
only needs 2 or 3 hits and she will burn like a torch.

993
01:52:32,863 --> 01:52:34,468
And who are they going to bomb with it?

994
01:52:34,745 --> 01:52:38,805
China. Russia. Britain. The Netherlands. America.

995
01:52:38,962 --> 01:52:40,053
Japan will blow up.

996
01:52:41,044 --> 01:52:44,781
We're not arms merchants. We
just want to build good aircraft.

997
01:52:44,881 --> 01:52:45,590
That's right.

998
01:52:46,256 --> 01:52:48,586
Good night, pal. Try to get some sleep.

999
01:52:48,749 --> 01:52:49,348
You too.

1000
01:52:50,848 --> 01:52:52,961
Boss, I'm calling it a day.

1001
01:52:53,695 --> 01:52:54,504
Good night, sir.

1002
01:52:55,006 --> 01:52:55,677
Good night.

1003
01:53:21,186 --> 01:53:22,322
Welcome home.

1004
01:53:23,126 --> 01:53:26,073
My plane is finished. Now we'll see how she flies.

1005
01:53:26,319 --> 01:53:29,376
Congratulations. You worked so hard.

1006
01:53:30,169 --> 01:53:32,663
The oxen are taking her way to the field now.

1007
01:53:33,238 --> 01:53:35,672
I'll probably have to spend the next few nights there.

1008
01:53:36,917 --> 01:53:38,531
You must be tired, my love.

1009
01:53:40,931 --> 01:53:41,732
Just a little.

1010
01:53:42,701 --> 01:53:44,266
She will fly beautifully.

1011
01:53:45,306 --> 01:53:46,864
Hmm, she will.

1012
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:50,269
I couldn't have done it without you here.

1013
01:53:51,321 --> 01:53:52,969
I love you, Jiro.

1014
01:53:54,243 --> 01:53:55,056
Naoko...

1015
01:54:48,908 --> 01:54:49,725
I'm off.

1016
01:54:50,403 --> 01:54:51,212
Good luck.

1017
01:55:18,436 --> 01:55:19,526
What are you doing up?

1018
01:55:20,077 --> 01:55:24,816
I'm feeling so much better today, Mrs.
Kurokawa. So I thought I'll take a walk.

1019
01:55:25,107 --> 01:55:27,780
Be careful, don't tire yourself out.

1020
01:55:27,796 --> 01:55:28,249
I know.

1021
01:55:29,086 --> 01:55:33,294
The room's still a mess but I'll
straighten it up when I get back.

1022
01:55:33,703 --> 01:55:35,724
All right but remember,

1023
01:55:36,042 --> 01:55:39,021
Kayo's coming soon to be here
for her brother's celebration.

1024
01:55:39,096 --> 01:55:40,762
Yes. I'll be back soon.

1025
01:56:22,830 --> 01:56:24,060
Then please come inside.

1026
01:56:30,709 --> 01:56:32,001
Oh, no.

1027
01:56:41,189 --> 01:56:44,547
She left us letters! This letter is for me.

1028
01:56:50,371 --> 01:56:54,377
Says she's going back to the sanatorium! I'll find her.

1029
01:56:54,885 --> 01:56:56,394
No! Let her go.

1030
01:56:59,555 --> 01:57:02,583
We shouldn't do anything until after Naoko's train leaves.

1031
01:57:04,502 --> 01:57:07,881
She wants him to always remember her as she was.

1032
01:57:55,036 --> 01:57:58,692
Wonderful, just look at her, true Japanese fighter.

1033
01:57:58,914 --> 01:58:01,213
What about speed? How she do?

1034
01:58:01,271 --> 01:58:04,520
The numbers, they're off the
charts. We're checking them again.

1035
01:58:04,653 --> 01:58:05,853
How fast is she?

1036
01:58:06,694 --> 01:58:07,838
240.

1037
01:58:07,853 --> 01:58:08,822
Two forty?

1038
01:58:49,129 --> 01:58:50,160
Hey, Jiro.

1039
01:58:50,626 --> 01:58:51,224
Jiro!

1040
01:58:59,810 --> 01:59:02,462
She flies like a dream. Thank you.

1041
02:00:15,150 --> 02:00:18,511
So, we meet again, Japanese boy.

1042
02:00:19,510 --> 02:00:20,536
Mr. Caproni...

1043
02:00:24,975 --> 02:00:27,863
I remember this place. This is where we first met.

1044
02:00:28,362 --> 02:00:30,322
In our kingdom of dreams.

1045
02:00:30,890 --> 02:00:32,687
Now it's the land of the dead.

1046
02:00:33,023 --> 02:00:35,583
Not quite but in some ways, yes.

1047
02:00:36,498 --> 02:00:39,701
But what about your ten years in
the sun, did you live them well?

1048
02:00:40,313 --> 02:00:42,957
Yes. Things fell apart in the end, though.

1049
02:00:43,383 --> 02:00:45,452
That's what happen when you lose a war.

1050
02:00:47,036 --> 02:00:48,287
There's your fighter.

1051
02:01:26,011 --> 02:01:28,650
Truly, truly a masterful design.

1052
02:01:29,357 --> 02:01:31,041
Not a single one returned.

1053
02:01:31,923 --> 02:01:33,962
There was nothing to return to.

1054
02:01:34,649 --> 02:01:37,421
Airplanes are beautiful curse of dreams,

1055
02:01:37,647 --> 02:01:39,844
waiting for the sky to swallow them up.

1056
02:01:41,930 --> 02:01:43,291
Someone is waiting for you.

1057
02:01:58,683 --> 02:01:59,292
Naoko...

1058
02:02:00,261 --> 02:02:03,124
She's been waiting here for a long time.

1059
02:02:03,482 --> 02:02:05,592
You must live, darling.

1060
02:02:10,225 --> 02:02:11,453
You must live...

1061
02:02:33,715 --> 02:02:35,286
She was beautiful,

1062
02:02:36,243 --> 02:02:38,418
like the wind.

1063
02:02:40,937 --> 02:02:44,113
Thank you. Thank you.

1064
02:02:46,445 --> 02:02:47,907
You must live.

1065
02:02:48,777 --> 02:02:53,768
But now, shall we drop by my
house? I've some very excellent wine.
