 <i>Castle? </i>

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:58.616 position:5% line:71% align:start
Yes, Lord Raikage, we've
located the box, but we
can't get anywhere near
it, security's too tight.

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.653 position:5% line:5% align:start
Keep a close watch. If
you see the slightest
chance, take it.

00:01:02.687 --> 00:01:04.355 position:35% line:89% align:start
 <i>Yes, sir. </i>

00:01:04.388 --> 00:01:08.958 position:5% line:5% align:start
You really believe this
thing exists? I mean,
come on, a box that can
grant any wish?

00:01:09.493 --> 00:01:12.530 position:41% line:83% align:start
I agree it sounds a
little far-fetched.

00:01:12.563 --> 00:01:17.300 position:27% line:71% align:start
And yet, we can't afford
to write it off. Consider
the possibility this
thing is not a box, per

00:01:17.334 --> 00:01:20.337 position:47% line:77% align:start
se. That "box" is
just a euphemism for
something else...

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.672 position:44% line:83% align:start
...some incredibly
powerful weapon--

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:25.675 position:35% line:77% align:start
[grunting]
Shut up! You talk too
much, you know that?

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.647 position:5% line:77% align:start
Can such an object really
exist, Lord Raikage? Do
you believe it?

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.586 position:33% line:71% align:start
It is said there was a
time when the Hidden Grass
nearly conquered the world
with the help of that box.

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.321 position:38% line:89% align:start
We can't ignore it.

00:01:38.655 --> 00:01:41.391 position:35% line:83% align:start
Have you made contact
with the Hidden Leaf?

00:01:41.424 --> 00:01:47.364 position:5% line:71% align:start
Lady Tsunade has agreed
to coordinate the actions of
her village with those of ours,
the Hidden Cloud.

00:01:47.797 --> 00:01:51.867 position:47% line:83% align:start
Naturally... This
situation affects us all.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.472 position:30% line:83% align:start
She understands this is
no time for self-interest.

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.742 position:5% line:89% align:start
What the devil--?!

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.811 position:5% line:89% align:start
(gasp)

00:02:04.581 --> 00:02:09.885 position:24% line:89% align:start
[groggy breathing]

00:02:16.024 --> 00:02:17.727 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hyaah!

00:02:20.996 --> 00:02:22.564 position:5% line:89% align:start
Who dares--?!

00:02:32.441 --> 00:02:33.475 position:35% line:89% align:start
Careless!

00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:37.479 position:35% line:89% align:start
[gasping]

00:02:52.761 --> 00:02:54.296 position:52% line:89% align:start
But you are--!

00:03:08.877 --> 00:03:14.917 position:5% line:71% align:start
It would appear the
situation has grown even
more serious than I
expected... Summon Bee.

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:16.384 position:24% line:89% align:start
(startled breath)

00:03:16.417 --> 00:03:20.789 position:5% line:71% align:start
Surely we can handle this
ourselves without
bothering Lord Killer
Bee.

00:03:20.823 --> 00:03:26.127 position:5% line:77% align:start
We cannot afford to fail,
not this time. Summon
him, now!

00:03:29.497 --> 00:03:32.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>Someone attacked the</i>
 <i>Raikage last night. </i>

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.801 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:03:33.835 --> 00:03:37.438 position:5% line:77% align:start
What's more, the Hidden
Cloud Village claims it
was you, Naruto.

00:03:37.472 --> 00:03:43.511 position:38% line:71% align:start
What, me? That's the
dumbest thing I-- Oh,
you're putting me on
again, aren't you Granny--

00:03:43.544 --> 00:03:49.015 position:5% line:71% align:start
The Hidden Cloud lost
three jonin. Meanwhile,
the Hidden Stone had two
shinobi killed.

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.186 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>Both villages sent out</i>
 <i>these composite sketches</i>
 <i>of the attacker. </i>

00:03:53.554 --> 00:03:54.455 position:41% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:03:55.523 --> 00:03:57.725 position:19% line:83% align:start
No way! This has gotta
be some kind of mistake!

00:03:57.758 --> 00:03:59.727 position:19% line:83% align:start
Naruto would never do
such a thing, milady--

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.928 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Silence! </i>

00:04:00.962 --> 00:04:01.896 position:30% line:89% align:start
But, I mean--

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:05.198 position:5% line:83% align:start
We've got a diplomatic
crisis on our hands!

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.869 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>It-it wasn't me! </i>

00:04:07.902 --> 00:04:10.103 position:5% line:83% align:start
Kakashi-sensei, you gotta
believe me!

00:04:10.136 --> 00:04:15.643 position:5% line:71% align:start
All I did last night was
have dinner at Ichiraku
Ramen, and then, uh--
then I played some shogi

00:04:15.676 --> 00:04:17.544 position:5% line:83% align:start
with Shikamaru and then I
went to bed!

00:04:17.577 --> 00:04:22.349 position:5% line:71% align:start
Until we can get to the
bottom of this, Naruto, I
have no choice but to
send you to Hozuki Castle.

00:04:22.382 --> 00:04:26.319 position:21% line:83% align:start
Huh? Send me where?
What's Hozuki Castle?

00:04:26.353 --> 00:04:31.091 position:35% line:71% align:start
It's a prison located
in the Hidden Grass, but
run jointly by all the
villages.

00:04:31.124 --> 00:04:35.595 position:5% line:71% align:start
It's the place where
the villages send rogue
or otherwise troublesome
shinobi.

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:40.600 position:5% line:71% align:start
It's easy enough to get
into, but a lot more
difficult to get out of,
as you'll soon discover.

00:04:40.634 --> 00:04:44.237 position:24% line:77% align:start
But I didn't do anything,
this is crazy! I'm being
framed!

00:04:44.271 --> 00:04:46.206 position:35% line:83% align:start
Somebody wants me put
away--

00:04:46.239 --> 00:04:47.607 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's enough, Naruto!

00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:48.742 position:19% line:89% align:start
Shadow Clone Jutsu--!

00:04:48.775 --> 00:04:51.878 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hyuh! Wood Style!
Four-Pillar Prison!

00:04:55.047 --> 00:04:57.951 position:19% line:89% align:start
Stop! This is crazy!!

00:04:58.885 --> 00:05:02.022 position:5% line:5% align:start
It's a mistake!

00:05:03.757 --> 00:05:05.458 position:5% line:89% align:start
Take him away!

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:10.830 position:5% line:83% align:start
It wasn't me! I
didn't do anything!!

00:06:09.454 --> 00:06:10.990 position:35% line:89% align:start
Attention!

00:06:11.023 --> 00:06:14.225 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now then, new arrivals,
listen up and remain silent!

00:06:14.258 --> 00:06:18.396 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>Lord Mui, the master of</i>
 <i>Hozuki Castle, will now</i>
 <i>address you!</i>

00:06:21.666 --> 00:06:24.535 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let me explain your
situation.

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:29.008 position:5% line:71% align:start
Whatever you may have
been in your former
lives, the fact that you
were sent here means that

00:06:29.041 --> 00:06:31.342 position:5% line:83% align:start
you are no longer of any
value to anyone.

00:06:31.376 --> 00:06:36.115 position:5% line:71% align:start
You have lost the trust
of your people and are
considered a threat to
the peace and stability of--

00:06:36.147 --> 00:06:38.050 position:30% line:89% align:start
 <i>I was framed! </i>

00:06:38.083 --> 00:06:41.419 position:24% line:71% align:start
This is a joke, I
didn't do anything!
You've got the wrong guy,
Lord-whatever-your-name-is!

00:06:41.452 --> 00:06:42.987 position:5% line:89% align:start
Silence there, you dog--!

00:06:43.921 --> 00:06:48.026 position:5% line:77% align:start
You're the innocent
victim of some sort of
conspiracy, is that it?

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:52.030 position:5% line:71% align:start
Exactly, and while
we're wasting time
here, the real guilty
guy is still out there,

00:06:52.063 --> 00:06:53.765 position:5% line:83% align:start
about to do who knows
what!

00:06:53.798 --> 00:06:58.636 position:5% line:71% align:start
We of the Hidden Grass
have an agreement with
the other villages
whereby we guarantee that

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.806 position:5% line:77% align:start
those sent here will
never be allowed to
escape.

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:05.143 position:5% line:77% align:start
Your personal
circumstances are none of
our concern.

00:07:05.375 --> 00:07:08.112 position:5% line:83% align:start
Fire Style: Celestial
Prison!

00:07:10.048 --> 00:07:13.951 position:5% line:83% align:start
That Imprisonment Jutsu
is unique to my clan.

00:07:13.985 --> 00:07:18.923 position:5% line:71% align:start
It's the reason why the
Hidden Grass chose us as
overseers of Hozuki
Castle.

00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:26.164 position:5% line:71% align:start
 <i>As long as you wear this</i>
 <i>jutsu formula, you will</i>
 <i>not be able to infuse</i>
 <i>your chakra. </i>

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:31.868 position:5% line:71% align:start
There are only two ways
you can leave this
place... The first is by
official request from the

00:07:31.902 --> 00:07:33.370 position:5% line:83% align:start
village that sent you
here...

00:07:33.403 --> 00:07:36.673 position:5% line:77% align:start
The second, and by far
the most common, is by
dying.

00:07:36.707 --> 00:07:42.512 position:5% line:71% align:start
Huh! Hate to disappoint
you, but I've got a
third way. Multi Shadow
Clone Jutsu!

00:07:43.914 --> 00:07:45.149 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:07:49.786 --> 00:07:50.954 position:64% line:29% align:start
[chuckling]
[gasping]

00:07:52.089 --> 00:07:56.993 position:5% line:5% align:start

 <i>feels like it's on fire.</i>

00:07:57.027 --> 00:08:01.765 position:5% line:71% align:start
I must admit, I'm
impressed. That you
could summon forth even
that much chakra under

00:08:01.798 --> 00:08:05.736 position:5% line:77% align:start
the Celestial Prison...
Still, don't think of
escaping.

00:08:06.002 --> 00:08:11.307 position:5% line:5% align:start
Go beyond a certain
distance from me and the
Celestial Prison will
fully activate...

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.143 position:5% line:83% align:start
... and burn you
to a cinder.

00:08:13.176 --> 00:08:18.681 position:5% line:71% align:start
One more thing. You may
have heard that the Fire
Style: Celestial Prison
is ineffective

00:08:18.715 --> 00:08:20.683 position:5% line:83% align:start
underwater, and it is
true...

00:08:20.716 --> 00:08:25.721 position:5% line:71% align:start
 <i>But the surrounding sea</i>
 <i>is deep and the currents</i>
 <i>are treacherous... You</i>
 <i>would drown long before</i>

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:27.690 position:5% line:83% align:start
you could infuse your
chakra.

[groaning and screaming in pain]

00:08:40.035 --> 00:08:44.807 position:5% line:71% align:start
As Lord Mui explained,
you're never getting
out of this place alive,
so you might as well get

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.575 position:5% line:89% align:start
used to being here.

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:50.980 position:5% line:77% align:start
Once you accept it,
you'll find it's not
so bad at all.

00:08:52.481 --> 00:08:54.016 position:5% line:89% align:start
[grunting]

00:08:54.583 --> 00:08:56.152 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeaaahh.

00:08:56.185 --> 00:09:00.222 position:5% line:5% align:start
These are some of our
old-timers. I'm sure
they'll make you feel
right at home.

 <i>[laughing]</i>

00:09:13.202 --> 00:09:16.939 position:5% line:77% align:start
First you'll have to
undergo a physical exam.
That means all of you!

00:09:16.972 --> 00:09:20.142 position:5% line:5% align:start
And I'm talking a
really thorough physical
exam,

00:09:20.176 --> 00:09:23.012 position:5% line:5% align:start
so I hope you're not
bashful, blondie.

00:09:23.045 --> 00:09:26.481 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

00:09:33.688 --> 00:09:36.891 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, uh, so what're you
in for?

00:09:36.925 --> 00:09:41.029 position:27% line:77% align:start
Nothing, nothing at all!
They got the wrong guy, I
didn't do a damn thing!

00:09:41.062 --> 00:09:42.096 position:5% line:89% align:start
What a shame.

00:09:42.131 --> 00:09:45.800 position:5% line:83% align:start
Me, I was given a mission
messed it up pretty bad.

00:09:45.834 --> 00:09:49.637 position:5% line:77% align:start
I was told to slaughter
every living soul in a
neighboring village.

00:09:49.671 --> 00:09:53.908 position:5% line:71% align:start
But in a moment of
weakness or something, I
let this one little kid
get away,

00:09:53.942 --> 00:09:55.276 position:33% line:83% align:start
and when my
village found out...

 <i>That was a crime? </i>

00:09:57.344 --> 00:09:59.747 position:5% line:83% align:start
What village you from,
anyway?

00:09:59.781 --> 00:10:02.016 position:5% line:5% align:start
The Hidden Leaf Village.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:07.487 position:5% line:5% align:start
Huh? Well, that explains it.
I've heard the Hidden Leaf are
a bunch of softies.

00:10:07.521 --> 00:10:09.324 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? What did you say?!

00:10:12.626 --> 00:10:16.630 position:5% line:77% align:start
I guess you guys in the
leaf don't take things like
that so seriously.

You don't know a thing
about us!

00:10:23.637 --> 00:10:28.009 position:5% line:71% align:start
You just watch! Just

framed me,

00:10:28.042 --> 00:10:30.311 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll show you who's
serious!

00:10:30.611 --> 00:10:33.447 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's enough, save
your breath.

00:30:29.256 --> 00:30:34.061 position:5% line:71% align:start

 <i>A box? </i>

00:31:06.259 --> 00:31:10.330 position:5% line:71% align:start
It's known as the Box
of Paradise and according
to legend it's supposed
to grant the wish of

00:31:10.363 --> 00:31:12.065 position:5% line:89% align:start
anyone who can open it.

00:31:12.099 --> 00:31:15.502 position:5% line:83% align:start

for sure if it's true.

00:31:18.572 --> 00:31:22.375 position:27% line:77% align:start

the era of the Sage of
Six Paths, the Hidden

00:31:22.409 --> 00:31:26.045 position:27% line:77% align:start

00:31:26.078 --> 00:31:28.415 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, what kept them from
finishing the job?

00:31:28.448 --> 00:31:33.686 position:35% line:77% align:start

one day the Hidden Grass

00:31:54.672 --> 00:32:00.479 position:5% line:71% align:start
According to the information
we've received, it requires
an enormous amount of chakra
to open the box.

00:32:00.513 --> 00:32:03.115 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's why you're
here.

00:32:03.149 --> 00:32:08.720 position:5% line:71% align:start
They want the chakra you
possess as a Jinchuriki,
so they framed you, knowing
you'd be sent here.

00:32:08.753 --> 00:32:14.627 position:5% line:5% align:start
So you're telling me these
Seeds of Grass guys are
responsible for me being
stuck here?!

00:32:14.659 --> 00:32:19.465 position:16% line:5% align:start
That's right. and my mission
is to prevent the Seeds of
Grass from opening the
Box, no matter what.

00:32:19.498 --> 00:32:22.601 position:5% line:5% align:start
Well then, maybe it was a
mistake to save me, you
ever thought of that?

00:32:22.635 --> 00:32:26.671 position:5% line:5% align:start
I mean,  come on, if
you'd let me drown,
they wouldn't be able
to open it.

served my purposes...

00:32:32.277 --> 00:32:36.114 position:5% line:5% align:start

you use your power to open

00:34:40.704 --> 00:34:42.371 position:5% line:83% align:start
you don't have to kill

Whatever the wish,
nothing is possible

Granny Tsunade?

01:35:59.452 --> 01:36:06.026 position:5% line:77% align:start
I heard a voice... I
heard Ryuzetsu's voice
calling out to me...

01:36:06.059 --> 01:36:08.061 position:5% line:89% align:start
Rest now.

01:36:08.795 --> 01:36:15.735 position:5% line:5% align:start
I was in a place that was
pitch black... It was
cold and so lonely...

01:36:15.769 --> 01:36:23.944 position:5% line:5% align:start
I guess it must've been

box, all alone...

01:36:23.977 --> 01:36:26.947 position:5% line:89% align:start
Enough, now... Naruto.

01:36:27.180 --> 01:36:32.852 position:5% line:71% align:start
There was no way out of
that place... and then I
heard her voice calling
me...

01:36:32.886 --> 01:36:36.623 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wait, where is she?
Where is Ryuzetsu?

01:36:46.399 --> 01:36:52.172 position:5% line:71% align:start
Chill it, homes, like the
lady said. Save it for
later, or you'll wind
up dead. You croak

01:36:52.205 --> 01:36:56.775 position:5% line:77% align:start

all right, right? I
didn't overdo it?

01:41:47.761 --> 01:41:53.234 position:5% line:71% align:start
That was kinda cruel,
wasn't it? I mean,
first you put him under
24-hour surveillance and

01:41:53.268 --> 01:41:56.571 position:5% line:77% align:start
then you drag the poor
guy in here at the crack
of dawn to accuse him!

01:41:56.604 --> 01:42:00.941 position:30% line:71% align:start
Don't give me that! Who
suggested we play along

the first place?!

01:42:00.974 --> 01:42:02.477 position:72% line:83% align:start

you, Kakashi!

01:42:05.179 --> 01:42:11.184 position:5% line:71% align:start
Oh, no, no, no. I don't think
so. After all, you were the
one who decided we should
undertake this covert

collaborative mission
with the Hidden Cloud
Village.

gonna do a job, you
might as well do it
right.

01:42:16.990 --> 01:42:20.794 position:5% line:77% align:start
In any case, Naruto's
feelings must be pretty
