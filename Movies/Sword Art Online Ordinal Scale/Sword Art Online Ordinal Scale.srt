1
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:53,954
I wish we could see real stars in Aincrad.

2
00:00:54,317 --> 00:00:56,740
Yeah, but this isn't so bad.

3
00:00:56,947 --> 00:01:00,079
I've never seen a shooting
star in the real world before.

4
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,590
Where I live, the sky's too bright at night.

5
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:06,007
A city‐girl. That explains a lot.

6
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:09,237
Oh, come on! Don't even tease me like that!

7
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:14,148
There's this one spot in my town
that's pretty famous for stargazing.

8
00:01:14,505 --> 00:01:16,408
It's even got a tiny observatory.

9
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:18,128
Oh, I know!

10
00:01:18,224 --> 00:01:20,654
Let's make a date to go see the stars there someday!

11
00:01:20,828 --> 00:01:23,386
Sure. Someday.

12
00:01:24,222 --> 00:01:27,765
We just have to make sure we survive
long enough to clear this game.

13
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,032
Yeah. And as soon as we do, I'll get you a real ring.

14
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:35,432
Mm‐hm.

15
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,023
On November 6th, 2022.

16
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:21,324
the NerveGear, a FullDive virtual reality device,

17
00:02:21,456 --> 00:02:25,516
launched its first game, Sword Art Online.

18
00:02:25,897 --> 00:02:30,677
Its developer, Akihiko Kayaba,
told the 10,000 players who logged in,

19
00:02:30,807 --> 00:02:32,683
they could not log out.

20
00:02:32,922 --> 00:02:36,369
And not only were they trapped, if a player died in‐game,

21
00:02:36,488 --> 00:02:38,840
they would also die in the real world.

22
00:02:40,237 --> 00:02:44,568
Amid growing despair, some took up
swords, hoping to clear the game.

23
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,516
Some became isolated and took their own lives.

24
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:52,481
While others ended up turning their
swords on their fellow players.

25
00:02:54,223 --> 00:02:57,947
This nightmare continued for
what seemed like an eternity.

26
00:02:58,273 --> 00:03:01,642
Then, on November 7th, 2024,

27
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,939
a heroic player dressed head‐to‐toe in black,

28
00:03:05,527 --> 00:03:09,483
cleared the game and set everyone free. Finally.

29
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:15,523
Close to 4,000 people died in the end.

30
00:03:15,983 --> 00:03:18,231
But with the death of the game's creator,

31
00:03:18,445 --> 00:03:22,268
Akihiko Kayaba, the nightmare was over.

32
00:03:24,517 --> 00:03:28,425
The players who lived through
it are known as SAO survivors.

33
00:03:28,814 --> 00:03:30,433
And slowly but surely,

34
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:33,461
they're getting back their lives in the real world.

35
00:04:07,912 --> 00:04:10,326
Um, sorry to bother you folks.

36
00:04:10,557 --> 00:04:13,006
I couldn't help but notice those things you're wearing.

37
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:17,398
Huh? What, this? It's an Augma!

38
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,085
Welcome to Augma.

39
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:27,845
Ever since it was made available to the public,
it has quickly become the gadget to have.

40
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:32,009
Today, we'll look into the Augma,
the next‐gen wearable device.

41
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:35,680
If you compare the Augma with
its predecessor, the AmuSphere,

42
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:37,967
you might think since it doesn't have a FullDive function,

43
00:04:37,992 --> 00:04:39,960
it's a step backward, technology‐wise.

44
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,924
But that's so totally not true.

45
00:04:41,972 --> 00:04:46,706
The user's fully conscious while using the Augma
and that opens up a whole world of possibilities.

46
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:50,330
Isn't comparing the two systems a little
like comparing apples to oranges, though?

47
00:04:50,447 --> 00:04:55,962
The AmuSphere immerses the user in a virtual reality,
while the Augma immerses the user in augmented reality.

48
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:57,427
You're absolutely right.

49
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:02,939
And if you wanna talk about safety, the Augma doesn't
come with any of the risks a FullDive rig has for users.

50
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:07,863
In fact, more and more people have been using
it for exercise and to track health goals.

51
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:11,390
Now we'll take a look at the
system's newest, hottest game,

52
00:05:11,415 --> 00:05:12,409
Ordinal Scale.

53
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:16,465
The most exciting feature about Ordinal Scale,

54
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,323
in my opinion, anyway, is the ranking system.

55
00:05:19,556 --> 00:05:23,062
Each player starts with a number that
reflects their ranking in the game.

56
00:05:23,097 --> 00:05:26,093
The more a person plays, the higher their rank's gonna be.

57
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:31,955
Once you get your rank high enough,
you can unlock rewards outside the game.

58
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:34,967
Stuff like products and services from partner companies!

59
00:05:35,031 --> 00:05:36,635
Would you look at that!

60
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,015
There's a discount from a big online
retailer and early access to tickets.

61
00:05:41,057 --> 00:05:42,903
There's exclusive shopping sites

62
00:05:42,928 --> 00:05:45,652
and a coupon for a free extra large beef bowl, too!

63
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,742
Kids always go nuts for freebies.

64
00:05:48,925 --> 00:05:52,000
If they're that good in the lower ranks,
imagine what the top rank will get.

65
00:05:53,874 --> 00:05:55,654
When service for the game started,

66
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:58,054
drones were launched to ease the strain on the network.

67
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,763
They were strange at first,
but folks seem used to them now.

68
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:06,397
One of the main reasons the game is gaining
popularity is thanks to its mascot, Yuna.

69
00:06:06,897 --> 00:06:12,594
She's the world's first AR pop star and a testament
to how far AI tech has come over the years.

70
00:06:12,935 --> 00:06:15,628
In fact, her mannerisms are so life‐like,

71
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:18,591
some think she's actually human and not a program.

72
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:20,386
She's mysterious!

73
00:06:20,553 --> 00:06:22,682
That's probably the main reason she's so popular.

74
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:24,519
I just started collecting her figures myself...

75
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:26,314
Uh, Yuna's first live concert

76
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:28,052
is scheduled for the end of this month

77
00:06:28,077 --> 00:06:30,488
and tickets for it, all 30,000 of them,

78
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:32,535
sold out almost instantly.

79
00:06:32,655 --> 00:06:34,330
I had to get mine from a scalper

80
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:36,042
and they damn‐near cost me my condo...

81
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,635
The popularity of Augma and Ordinal Scale

82
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,591
isn't slowing down anytime soon!

83
00:06:55,006 --> 00:06:56,593
All right, we cleared it!

84
00:06:56,688 --> 00:06:59,157
Good job, Silica! Nice assist, Liz!

85
00:06:59,182 --> 00:07:01,133
We all got a hundred points for beating it.

86
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:05,087
Look! It says we each get a free slice of cake! Sweet!

87
00:07:05,182 --> 00:07:07,689
You guys play games way too much these days.

88
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,653
I‐I never thought I'd hear that coming from you!

89
00:07:10,815 --> 00:07:13,617
Heck, every time we play, we get points to shop at stores.

90
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:15,208
Might as well play our butts off.

91
00:07:15,383 --> 00:07:18,209
I bet deep down, you wanted to play, too, didn't you?

92
00:07:19,363 --> 00:07:21,849
Well, I love this thing. It's super convenient.

93
00:07:22,127 --> 00:07:23,931
It lets you watch TV anywhere,

94
00:07:23,956 --> 00:07:25,980
it's easier to navigate than a smart phone

95
00:07:26,005 --> 00:07:27,979
and the weather report's a lifesaver.

96
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:30,826
Best of all, we can talk to Yui whenever we want.

97
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:31,573
Yup!

98
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,784
You sound like you're totally sold on the Augma!

99
00:07:35,127 --> 00:07:36,914
Mm, I wouldn't say that.

100
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:41,116
But, hey, they did hand them out to everyone
going to the survivor's school, right?

101
00:07:41,283 --> 00:07:43,626
So,the least we do is take them out for a spin

102
00:07:43,651 --> 00:07:44,763
and see what they can do.

103
00:07:44,804 --> 00:07:46,075
I'm sorry for the wait.

104
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,436
Here are your bonus treats for clearing the game.

105
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:52,790
Dibs on that one!

106
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:58,045
The AI's so sharp, it knows what kind of cake we like.

107
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,674
It does a thing they call "Deep Learning".

108
00:08:00,707 --> 00:08:02,185
Pretty thoughtful.

109
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,854
It's even more thoughtful than certain people we know.

110
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,532
I hear it can even tell you how
many calories are in that cake.

111
00:08:16,052 --> 00:08:19,021
Wait up, Liz! Where are you going?

112
00:08:38,369 --> 00:08:39,496
Asuna?

113
00:08:42,482 --> 00:08:43,943
I still can't believe it.

114
00:08:44,214 --> 00:08:48,033
All of us at the survivor's school got
free tickets to go to Yuna's concert.

115
00:08:48,297 --> 00:08:50,811
Going to a concert's kinda weird for a field trip.

116
00:08:50,853 --> 00:08:53,567
I know. Everything about that school is weird.

117
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:55,946
Yeah, but now you get to see your girl crush.

118
00:08:55,988 --> 00:08:58,577
What? I‐I don't have a crush on her!

119
00:08:58,619 --> 00:09:01,875
Who was belting out her songs at karaoke with Suguha?

120
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,633
You know every line to every song and I'll prove it!

121
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,125
You were great, Silica!

122
00:09:50,668 --> 00:09:53,812
Kirito? You're gonna come to the concert with us, right?

123
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,688
Huh? I wasn't planning on it.

124
00:09:56,985 --> 00:09:59,783
I'm not much of a fan, if you wanna know the truth.

125
00:09:59,945 --> 00:10:02,538
What? You should go, it'll be fun!

126
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:04,709
Well, I don't know, maybe.

127
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:08,637
Anyway, I gotta admit,

128
00:10:08,662 --> 00:10:10,830
you can do a lot of cool stuff with this gadget.

129
00:10:11,472 --> 00:10:14,269
Still, I think FullDives are more my thing.

130
00:10:14,485 --> 00:10:15,279
You're kidding.

131
00:10:15,446 --> 00:10:18,799
No. I guess I just got used to living in different worlds.

132
00:10:23,544 --> 00:10:26,228
You doofus. You sound like you wanna go back.

133
00:10:27,404 --> 00:10:29,430
Oh! Speaking of Aincrad,

134
00:10:29,684 --> 00:10:32,535
Do you guys think that rumor about Ordinal Scale is true?

135
00:10:32,797 --> 00:10:36,316
You know, the one about boss monsters
from old SAO showing up in it?

136
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,111
Oh, right. The mysterious event battles.

137
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:42,200
Really? Is it like some kind of promotion?

138
00:10:42,403 --> 00:10:43,276
I don't know.

139
00:10:43,506 --> 00:10:45,484
I haven't had the chance to check one out yet.

140
00:10:45,683 --> 00:10:50,776
The locations are secret till the last minute, so it's
hard for folks who don't have a car to get there in time.

141
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,660
It'd be awesome to find out, though.

142
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:56,003
So all we need is a ride? Hmm.

143
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:04,345
Kirito!

144
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:25,088
Looks like we made it just in time.

145
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,583
They released the location a half‐hour ago.

146
00:11:27,704 --> 00:11:29,857
And there's already so many people here!

147
00:11:30,674 --> 00:11:33,496
That means there'll be even more by the time it starts.

148
00:11:33,535 --> 00:11:35,124
About time you showed up?

149
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,713
Sweet! You brought Asuna with you!

150
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:42,220
No, I brought him! He didn't want to come,
but after I beat the others at rock‐paper‐scissors,

151
00:11:42,371 --> 00:11:43,515
he didn't have a choice!

152
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,699
Huh? Yeah, whatever.

153
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,766
Guys, Let's show her how badass we are!

154
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,181
Yeah!

155
00:11:50,206 --> 00:11:51,673
All right! - It's gonna be awesome!

156
00:11:51,698 --> 00:11:53,501
Kirito, it's almost time to start.

157
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,716
Oh, right.

158
00:11:58,352 --> 00:12:01,150
Ordinal Scale , activate!

159
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:44,311
That's...

160
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:46,448
The boss from Floor 10 in Aincrad.

161
00:12:46,574 --> 00:12:48,286
Kagachi the Samurai Lord!

162
00:12:48,671 --> 00:12:50,833
He looks exactly like him, doesn't he?

163
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:53,319
Too bad we can't use our sword skills here.

164
00:12:53,493 --> 00:12:56,186
I wonder if he's gonna use the same attack patterns.

165
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:06,778
Yuna?

166
00:13:06,865 --> 00:13:08,426
I hope everyone's ready!

167
00:13:08,518 --> 00:13:12,116
It's time to battle! So, start the music!

168
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:15,256
Uh... Oh, awesome! Yuna's singing!

169
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:17,709
It's a special stage with a bonus!

170
00:13:41,768 --> 00:13:43,689
I'm gonna piss myself!

171
00:13:44,076 --> 00:13:45,610
How do we beat this thing?

172
00:13:45,635 --> 00:13:46,871
He's frigging huge!

173
00:13:48,155 --> 00:13:50,486
What do you say, Kiri‐dude?

174
00:13:53,793 --> 00:13:55,666
No, wait! Time out!

175
00:13:55,691 --> 00:13:56,502
Time out!

176
00:14:14,467 --> 00:14:18,349
Don't let your HP hit zero! Your rank will get docked!

177
00:14:18,374 --> 00:14:19,501
I know that!

178
00:14:22,223 --> 00:14:24,746
Our guns didn't do jack to it at this range.

179
00:14:24,811 --> 00:14:26,566
No way am I gonna get up close!

180
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:27,256
Hey!

181
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:35,083
Come on, you guys! That bonus has our name on it!

182
00:14:40,802 --> 00:14:41,805
I got it!

183
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:43,041
Nice block!

184
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:47,107
Tank!

185
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,851
I'm on it!

186
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,101
Eight showed up. Perfect.

187
00:15:17,158 --> 00:15:20,860
Body feels heavy. This isn't like VR at all.

188
00:15:21,798 --> 00:15:23,245
It's coming for you!

189
00:15:23,348 --> 00:15:24,269
Kirito!

190
00:15:33,073 --> 00:15:34,256
Whoa!

191
00:15:36,141 --> 00:15:37,841
Holy crap! It's hard to move!

192
00:15:38,253 --> 00:15:40,326
You're just a little out of shape, is all!

193
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:42,137
I'm not out of shape!

194
00:15:43,768 --> 00:15:45,139
The hell's he doing?

195
00:15:45,482 --> 00:15:47,686
Watch it, I got the kill‐shot! ‐Huh?

196
00:15:53,197 --> 00:15:53,889
Oh.

197
00:16:12,893 --> 00:16:13,933
Nice one!

198
00:16:14,153 --> 00:16:15,154
Rank 2?

199
00:16:22,294 --> 00:16:25,619
He's making his killer move! Tanks! Follow me!

200
00:16:34,511 --> 00:16:36,576
Nice hit, man! Come on!

201
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:39,038
Yes! Wait for me!

202
00:17:00,248 --> 00:17:01,714
Move! Retreat!

203
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:02,756
Right behind you!

204
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:13,860
All right!

205
00:17:20,194 --> 00:17:21,833
Switch.

206
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:26,216
Go!

207
00:17:41,831 --> 00:17:43,074
That was awesome!

208
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:43,459
Yeah!

209
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,473
Congratulations on defeating the boss!

210
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,745
I just boosted everyone's points!

211
00:17:51,623 --> 00:17:55,372
And I have a special reward for
the player who worked the hardest!

212
00:17:55,952 --> 00:17:56,793
Yes!

213
00:17:59,973 --> 00:18:00,827
Oh.

214
00:18:01,985 --> 00:18:05,605
You're this battle's MVP. Congratulations!

215
00:18:09,404 --> 00:18:11,380
See you at the next battle!

216
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:19,102
Nice job, Asuna.

217
00:18:21,326 --> 00:18:23,156
So that guy's number two?

218
00:18:23,409 --> 00:18:25,423
He's a powerful player, that's for sure.

219
00:18:28,048 --> 00:18:31,221
Dude, my rank shot up from just this one battle.

220
00:18:31,331 --> 00:18:32,046
Look.

221
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:35,168
Man, those SAO bosses pay out!

222
00:18:35,193 --> 00:18:38,085
If the other users find out,
this game's gonna get crowded!

223
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,574
Huh?

224
00:18:40,762 --> 00:18:41,677
Well, well!

225
00:18:41,702 --> 00:18:44,247
Looks like you barely moved up in rank, Kiri‐dawg!

226
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,678
Like I care. I'm leaving the AR raids to you guys.

227
00:18:49,008 --> 00:18:51,047
Make sure you get the lady home safe.

228
00:18:51,072 --> 00:18:52,232
Of course I will!

229
00:18:52,335 --> 00:18:55,114
Hey, if the kid here gets fresh with you, give me a call.

230
00:18:55,139 --> 00:18:56,308
I'll come save you!

231
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,148
You got it!

232
00:19:12,287 --> 00:19:15,334
Huh? What the heck's an item doing here?

233
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:20,906
What the...? Oh, it's you.

234
00:19:21,723 --> 00:19:24,138
Ah, so you wanna steal my find, huh?

235
00:19:24,281 --> 00:19:26,848
I don't give a damn if you are ranked number two.

236
00:19:26,903 --> 00:19:28,920
I ain't gonna give it up that easy.

237
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:43,698
Man! That boss moved the same as the one from SAO.

238
00:19:43,793 --> 00:19:45,677
Wish I could say I moved the same.

239
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,793
After all that running around, my whole body's sore.

240
00:19:48,926 --> 00:19:51,247
Can't believe you guys took it down so quick.

241
00:19:51,342 --> 00:19:53,797
For one thing, Asuna and I fought it before.

242
00:19:54,146 --> 00:19:58,772
Yeah, but still, it wasn't easy. You could tell the
other players weren't used to working as a team.

243
00:19:58,842 --> 00:20:01,234
By the end of it, Kirito was exhausted.

244
00:20:01,716 --> 00:20:04,617
That's only 'cause I'm not used to fighting in AR.

245
00:20:04,776 --> 00:20:05,411
Hmm?

246
00:20:06,103 --> 00:20:08,708
Oh, and you'll never guess who showed up to cheer us on.

247
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:10,845
You know that girl, Yuna? She gave us a reward

248
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,635
Huh? Yuna was at the boss fight with you guys?

249
00:20:13,676 --> 00:20:14,682
For real?

250
00:20:17,225 --> 00:20:18,497
What's she like?

251
00:20:18,812 --> 00:20:21,066
That was pretty cool, seeing her live.

252
00:20:21,215 --> 00:20:24,901
But like a dumbass, I forgot to put
my name down for one of those tickets.

253
00:20:25,044 --> 00:20:26,601
Too bad you missed out, man.

254
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:30,334
When they were doing those Ordinal Scale
sign‐ups, I scored myself a pair.

255
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,209
Yeah, I got a pair, too.

256
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:34,748
You got two?

257
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,806
Oh, come on! Hook me up!

258
00:20:36,848 --> 00:20:37,884
All right, all right!

259
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:40,146
Get off! Stop begging, I'll let you have one.

260
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:40,973
Stare.

261
00:20:40,998 --> 00:20:43,110
Yes, Leafa, I'll give you a ticket.

262
00:20:43,445 --> 00:20:44,897
Yay!

263
00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:49,775
Uh, I just remembered,
I have kendo boot camp next week.

264
00:20:53,304 --> 00:20:56,395
Is anyone else as weirded
out about this as I am?

265
00:20:56,458 --> 00:21:01,645
I mean, what's up with an old SAO boss
showing up at an Ordinal Scale battle.

266
00:21:01,835 --> 00:21:04,807
If it were a tie‐in between
games, wouldn't we have heard?

267
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,206
Mm‐hm. But I don't think that's what's going on.

268
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:10,999
Argus, the company that used to run SAO
, was shut down a while ago.

269
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:13,396
What about the other players at the event?

270
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:15,509
Did they know the boss was from SAO , too?

271
00:21:15,622 --> 00:21:18,108
Mm. No, I'm pretty sure most of them didn't.

272
00:21:18,222 --> 00:21:22,628
No one knew its attack patterns,
except us and maybe one or two others.

273
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,039
Switch.

274
00:21:27,658 --> 00:21:29,202
Isn't that the impression you got?

275
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:31,725
Yeah. Most of them never saw it before.

276
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,871
The thing is, if the old bosses from SAO keep showing up,

277
00:21:34,998 --> 00:21:37,719
it's only a matter of time before folks start catching on.

278
00:21:37,842 --> 00:21:40,307
And those battle events are where the points are at.

279
00:21:40,829 --> 00:21:45,421
Sounds like someone's trying to bring
old Aincrad to the real world. Damn.

280
00:21:45,652 --> 00:21:46,766
So what?

281
00:21:46,846 --> 00:21:50,841
The Augma's nothing like the NerveGear,
so no one's gonna die. It's safe.

282
00:21:50,905 --> 00:21:53,543
Anyway, Yui, see if anything's fishy.

283
00:21:53,662 --> 00:21:54,844
Okay, Daddy!

284
00:21:54,996 --> 00:21:56,591
Heck, if I can hang out with Yuna,

285
00:21:56,632 --> 00:21:58,181
I'll totally go to a battle!

286
00:21:58,206 --> 00:21:58,836
Me, too!

287
00:21:59,391 --> 00:22:01,561
And next time, he'll give me a ride on his bike.

288
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,430
I wish these events would happen at better
times and at places that are easier to get to.

289
00:22:06,565 --> 00:22:10,742
That's what us guys in Fuurinkazan are for!
If any of you ladies need a ride,

290
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:12,680
just pick up the phone and we'll pick you up!

291
00:22:12,705 --> 00:22:14,500
Yeah, that's what worries us, Klein.

292
00:22:14,636 --> 00:22:16,305
But! Oh, you suck.

293
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,011
Yuna.

294
00:22:21,517 --> 00:22:22,851
What's wrong, Yuna?

295
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,354
What is this thingy?

296
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,347
Proof that everyone loved your singing.

297
00:22:27,665 --> 00:22:29,405
Really? This little guy?

298
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:30,660
Hmm.

299
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,330
There'll be plenty more where that came from...

300
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:37,463
after I get my revenge on them.

301
00:22:44,856 --> 00:22:46,481
I'm heading out now, Kazuto!

302
00:22:47,389 --> 00:22:49,552
Okay. Have fun at boot camp.

303
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:52,491
You gonna change out of those sweats anytime soon?

304
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,177
Yeah, well, I'm just gonna stay home today.

305
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,790
And research some colleges.

306
00:22:56,815 --> 00:22:59,299
That's good, but you should get some exercise, too.

307
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,111
Grab a shinai and go swing it around outside, at least.

308
00:23:02,136 --> 00:23:03,869
Yeah, maybe. If I feel like it.

309
00:23:04,028 --> 00:23:04,958
Don't forget to bring back some of those

310
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:07,896
Whatever. You know, you should try using the Augma more.

311
00:23:08,025 --> 00:23:10,271
You could win a free gym membership!

312
00:23:10,694 --> 00:23:12,033
Well, see you!

313
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,863
AR's everywhere I look these days.

314
00:23:50,928 --> 00:23:51,967
Link start!

315
00:23:59,837 --> 00:24:02,040
Asuna! Hey.

316
00:24:02,177 --> 00:24:04,099
Hey, you! So, what's going on?

317
00:24:04,304 --> 00:24:05,474
Is Leafa coming?

318
00:24:05,561 --> 00:24:08,565
No. She just left for that Kendo boot camp.

319
00:24:08,812 --> 00:24:10,089
Is she gone for long?

320
00:24:10,114 --> 00:24:11,151
A few days.

321
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:14,198
Waking up in the morning's gonna be tough.
She's my alarm clock.

322
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:16,246
Dork!

323
00:24:17,407 --> 00:24:19,375
Even though she's gone, make sure you eat.

324
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:22,421
Of course! You know, I can cook for myself.

325
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,978
If you say so.

326
00:24:24,343 --> 00:24:27,594
But when you have stuff on your mind,
you tend to forget things like eating right.

327
00:24:27,619 --> 00:24:30,899
Daddy only makes pasta with one ingredient, pepperoncini.

328
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,899
TMI, Yui. TMI.

329
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:39,343
Kirito, I was thinking about our plans.

330
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:42,088
My mom said she'd like to meet you one of these days.

331
00:24:42,171 --> 00:24:45,237
Yeah, one of these days. Sure.

332
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,430
Mm.

333
00:24:53,017 --> 00:24:56,019
They postponed another event quest in ALO.

334
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:57,408
Again?

335
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:02,811
I just checked and in the last two weeks,
ALO has had a 30 percent drop in logins.

336
00:25:03,113 --> 00:25:06,402
I guess it's because everyone's
busy playing Ordinal Scale.

337
00:25:06,775 --> 00:25:09,016
Yeah, maybe. For now.

338
00:25:09,056 --> 00:25:11,104
But I'm sure they'll come back eventually.

339
00:25:11,765 --> 00:25:12,858
Yeah.

340
00:26:02,114 --> 00:26:02,535
Huh?

341
00:26:03,171 --> 00:26:06,134
Hey, Asuna! Right on time!

342
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,417
Thanks for coming out tonight.

343
00:26:08,684 --> 00:26:10,446
Hope that text didn't wake you up.

344
00:26:10,648 --> 00:26:13,771
Oh, no. I wasn't in bed yet. You caught me taking a bath.

345
00:26:17,129 --> 00:26:18,698
You're missing one of your friends.

346
00:26:18,739 --> 00:26:22,269
Oh, yeah. We sent him a message,
but he hasn't called back yet.

347
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:25,702
How about you go on ahead,
we'll jump in once he gets here.

348
00:26:25,781 --> 00:26:26,345
Okay.

349
00:26:26,797 --> 00:26:28,222
But you better hurry.

350
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:30,680
Otherwise, I'm going to scoop
up all your points for myself.

351
00:26:30,962 --> 00:26:33,122
Hey, let's not be greedy!

352
00:26:34,646 --> 00:26:35,832
See you in there.

353
00:26:35,857 --> 00:26:36,888
Okay.

354
00:27:03,434 --> 00:27:05,118
Is everyone ready?

355
00:27:06,408 --> 00:27:08,724
Yeah! Wooo!

356
00:27:08,996 --> 00:27:12,410
It's time to battle! So, start the music!

357
00:27:18,209 --> 00:27:20,656
Crap, Yuna showed up! We gotta get in there!

358
00:27:20,712 --> 00:27:22,007
Is Dale gonna show, or what?

359
00:27:22,032 --> 00:27:24,955
Damn it. That loser still hasn't answered my text.

360
00:27:25,184 --> 00:27:27,308
We better hurry, or we'll miss out on that prey!

361
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:30,214
Actually, tonight, you're the prey!

362
00:27:33,454 --> 00:27:35,057
What's a boss doing here?

363
00:27:43,388 --> 00:27:44,847
It's a new song!

364
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:46,081
Aw, yeah!

365
00:27:55,733 --> 00:27:57,134
I'm impressed.

366
00:27:57,935 --> 00:28:01,034
I can see why they were some of
the best in the Assault Team.

367
00:28:10,061 --> 00:28:10,926
But...

368
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,343
I'll teach them the difference between AR and VR.

369
00:28:19,276 --> 00:28:21,890
Oh, yeah! Bring that bonus!

370
00:28:25,624 --> 00:28:28,331
VR never hurt like that, did it?

371
00:28:33,227 --> 00:28:35,824
Son of a bitch! I'm gonna kick your ass!

372
00:28:41,434 --> 00:28:43,571
Come on, don't be like that.

373
00:28:45,508 --> 00:28:46,439
Bastard.

374
00:28:50,316 --> 00:28:52,588
Now let's have some fun.

375
00:29:10,585 --> 00:29:12,617
Here. You dropped this.

376
00:29:20,117 --> 00:29:21,929
Now keep your eyes open.

377
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,360
It's winding up.

378
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,206
It's prepping for its big attack!

379
00:30:12,403 --> 00:30:14,253
You Tanks, draw its aggro!

380
00:30:14,294 --> 00:30:15,027
Okay.

381
00:30:16,717 --> 00:30:18,170
Its killer move is coming.

382
00:30:18,195 --> 00:30:20,355
When you see it hover, aim for the wings!

383
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,842
Huh? Right!

384
00:30:22,048 --> 00:30:24,263
Everyone moves in, once it hits the ground!

385
00:30:24,312 --> 00:30:25,190
You got it!

386
00:30:26,705 --> 00:30:28,380
Here, chickie, chickie!

387
00:30:33,068 --> 00:30:34,000
Fire!

388
00:30:37,331 --> 00:30:38,059
Go!

389
00:30:47,675 --> 00:30:48,509
Oh, shit!

390
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:11,369
Yo, you were amazing out there.

391
00:31:11,497 --> 00:31:12,690
Nice strategy!

392
00:31:12,715 --> 00:31:15,224
Yeah, you were awesome! You play any other games?

393
00:31:15,351 --> 00:31:17,353
Huh? Oh, uh...

394
00:31:17,456 --> 00:31:18,664
Hello again!

395
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:20,515
Congratulations!

396
00:31:20,999 --> 00:31:21,737
Oh.

397
00:31:25,603 --> 00:31:28,284
Oh, well. See you later, Asuna.

398
00:31:30,561 --> 00:31:32,756
Lightning Flash Asuna.

399
00:31:33,426 --> 00:31:35,737
Death isn't permanent in Ordinal Scale.

400
00:31:35,991 --> 00:31:39,668
And without the fear of death,
a player's potential is unlimited.

401
00:31:40,551 --> 00:31:43,973
Next time we meet in game,
I'll show you my potential.

402
00:32:05,348 --> 00:32:07,455
Here's the latest on Ordinal Scale,

403
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,578
the AR game everyone's talking about.

404
00:32:09,689 --> 00:32:13,349
Players are telling us that some of
the bosses from SAO 's old Aincrad,

405
00:32:13,421 --> 00:32:15,830
have been showing up in OS' event battles.

406
00:32:15,953 --> 00:32:20,255
The word on the forums is, a player can rack
up a boat‐load of points at those raids.

407
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:24,178
And not only that, there's a good chance
you'll catch Yuna singing at one of them!

408
00:32:25,221 --> 00:32:27,769
Leveling up and seeing Yuna would be awesome!

409
00:32:27,811 --> 00:32:29,192
Easy now!

410
00:32:29,535 --> 00:32:32,673
As we all know, Sword Art Online was shut down for good.

411
00:32:32,704 --> 00:32:35,652
But I bet you didn't know that there's
been a ton of new interest in it,

412
00:32:35,707 --> 00:32:40,029
thanks to a book that came out last month
called The Complete SAO Incident Report.

413
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,743
Huh. Hmm.

414
00:32:41,931 --> 00:32:44,187
Talk about jumping on the bandwagon late.

415
00:32:44,426 --> 00:32:46,457
I wonder if the book's popularity,

416
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:50,565
along with the recent spike in Augma users,
are the reasons for the huge drop in logins

417
00:32:50,621 --> 00:32:53,737
on the two big VR games, ALO and GGO.

418
00:32:53,989 --> 00:32:56,702
Do you think people are getting bored with VR?

419
00:32:56,794 --> 00:32:59,907
I have no idea, so let's ask some familiar faces,

420
00:32:59,994 --> 00:33:03,395
who might be able to shed some light
on what's going on in the VR world.

421
00:33:03,532 --> 00:33:04,507
Take it away!

422
00:33:04,571 --> 00:33:08,794
In the next ALO tourney, I want to fight
someone that'll have me shaking in my boots.

423
00:33:08,883 --> 00:33:11,215
Less players means less challenge for me.

424
00:33:11,405 --> 00:33:13,459
Hell, they might as well give me the trophy now.

425
00:33:13,484 --> 00:33:16,267
Yeah, well, you didn't win last time, did you?

426
00:33:16,714 --> 00:33:21,249
This world holds a special place in our hearts
and there's no way we're going to abandon it.

427
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:25,257
Yes, it's true. There are less
players in Sylph territory now.

428
00:33:25,425 --> 00:33:28,649
We can't hold major events like we used
to, which is a shame.

429
00:33:28,912 --> 00:33:31,354
But if you want to know the truth, I'm not worried.

430
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:33,871
I'm sure everyone will be back someday.

431
00:33:33,974 --> 00:33:36,525
Why'd you desert me, Fukajiro?

432
00:33:36,604 --> 00:33:38,931
I got a new grenade launcher for you and everything!

433
00:33:38,956 --> 00:33:41,317
You know how hard it is to get one of these?

434
00:33:41,531 --> 00:33:42,365
Where are you,Leafa?

435
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,928
Come back!

436
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:48,043
Sorry about that.

437
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:51,268
And now, please welcome our surprise guest. Enjoy!

438
00:33:51,314 --> 00:33:53,151
How's everyone doing tonight?

439
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:57,489
There's just four days left till my first live concert!

440
00:33:57,532 --> 00:33:59,707
I hope you're all looking forward to it.

441
00:34:38,503 --> 00:34:40,185
Hi, Daddy! Good morning.

442
00:34:40,575 --> 00:34:41,884
Good morning, Yui.

443
00:34:43,001 --> 00:34:43,866
Where are we?

444
00:34:43,891 --> 00:34:44,350
Oh.

445
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:47,369
This is the battlefield Asuna played on last night.

446
00:34:47,522 --> 00:34:50,111
She's putting a lot of effort into this game, huh?

447
00:34:50,564 --> 00:34:51,675
Yeah, she is.

448
00:34:53,654 --> 00:34:55,712
Is there something special about that day?

449
00:34:55,815 --> 00:35:00,692
Yup. That's when I promised Asuna I'd take
her up to Mt. Doudaira to watch the meteor shower.

450
00:35:00,867 --> 00:35:04,149
That sounds fun! Can I go, too? Can I?

451
00:35:04,515 --> 00:35:06,206
What do you think? Of course!

452
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:08,836
Goodie! I'm gonna wear something cute!

453
00:35:09,926 --> 00:35:13,026
Back in SAO, we promised each
other that if we got out, we'd...

454
00:35:13,051 --> 00:35:17,219
Hey, Daddy! This would be a great time to
do some fight training for Ordinal Scale.

455
00:35:17,441 --> 00:35:18,203
What?

456
00:35:18,228 --> 00:35:21,350
Mommy said she was worried about
you not getting enough exercise.

457
00:35:21,405 --> 00:35:24,670
Go on, show her how cool you are,
or your marriage will be in trouble!

458
00:35:27,053 --> 00:35:29,064
Ordinal Scale, activate.

459
00:35:35,618 --> 00:35:37,494
This doesn't feel right at all.

460
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,344
There's like a lag, or something.

461
00:35:39,485 --> 00:35:42,546
It's a different physical sensation. That's all!

462
00:35:43,786 --> 00:35:45,923
Practice is the only way to get better!

463
00:35:50,372 --> 00:35:51,563
Maybe if I...

464
00:35:51,911 --> 00:35:55,105
Oh, I'm sorry!

465
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:05,823
Who are you?

466
00:36:24,067 --> 00:36:25,338
Did you see that, Yui?

467
00:36:25,419 --> 00:36:26,125
Yes.

468
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,055
She didn't have an NPC tag.

469
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:30,390
She wasn't a player, either.

470
00:36:30,614 --> 00:36:33,783
Then, is she some kind of AR ghost?

471
00:36:33,927 --> 00:36:36,620
No, Daddy. That's impossible.

472
00:36:37,017 --> 00:36:38,518
I guess it is.

473
00:36:39,553 --> 00:36:41,782
It looked like she was saying something.

474
00:36:42,127 --> 00:36:45,017
By the way her mouth moved, I think she said the words,

475
00:36:45,144 --> 00:36:47,408
"Look for...", but that's all I could tell.

476
00:36:54,107 --> 00:36:55,976
I didn't mean to scare you.

477
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:59,262
I'm sorry I went without you last night.

478
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:01,503
No, that's okay. I don't mind.

479
00:37:01,996 --> 00:37:07,160
By the way, at that last battle we were at,
you said you saw some other SAO survivors.

480
00:37:07,311 --> 00:37:09,773
Yeah. That one player ranked second.

481
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:11,960
Really? That guy, huh?

482
00:37:12,045 --> 00:37:15,319
I think he was in the Knights of the Blood Oath. Maybe.

483
00:37:15,438 --> 00:37:16,194
"Maybe".

484
00:37:16,555 --> 00:37:20,158
Yeah, it's like, it's him,
but he's different than he was in SAO.

485
00:37:21,049 --> 00:37:25,108
Back then, he went by "Nautilus"
and I remember he had potential.

486
00:37:25,402 --> 00:37:29,945
I also remember he couldn't go on boss raids with
us, because he was afraid of dying.

487
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:32,727
Well, he's definitely changed his playing style.

488
00:37:33,546 --> 00:37:36,310
His agility in AR is unbelievable.

489
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:38,460
Like a gymnast, or something.

490
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:41,182
Hmm. Did you talk to him?

491
00:37:41,341 --> 00:37:44,501
Mm‐mm. I didn't know how he'd react to seeing me again.

492
00:37:45,195 --> 00:37:49,110
Still we were in the same guild,
so I'm a little concerned about him.

493
00:37:49,235 --> 00:37:51,713
It's hard to drop being second‐in‐command, huh?

494
00:37:51,738 --> 00:37:52,764
Watch it, soldier!

495
00:37:56,739 --> 00:37:58,128
Hey, Asuna,

496
00:37:58,415 --> 00:38:00,512
have you heard any stories about this park?

497
00:38:00,616 --> 00:38:02,252
You know, like, about ghosts.

498
00:38:02,308 --> 00:38:04,165
Oh, my God, would you stop.

499
00:38:04,563 --> 00:38:07,455
You know how freaked out I get,
talking about stuff like that.

500
00:38:07,526 --> 00:38:09,519
I know, I know! I'm sorry.

501
00:38:13,195 --> 00:38:14,628
Anyway, Kirito,

502
00:38:14,828 --> 00:38:16,727
let's talk about how we're going to break the news.

503
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:17,791
Uh, "news"?

504
00:38:17,847 --> 00:38:21,405
My mom knows something's up with us,
so she's been grilling me about you.

505
00:38:21,698 --> 00:38:24,273
Oh, right, that news. Mm hm.

506
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,318
She's not mad or anything.

507
00:38:26,696 --> 00:38:28,406
But we should figure out how to tell her.

508
00:38:28,509 --> 00:38:29,987
Yeah. You're right.

509
00:38:30,261 --> 00:38:33,576
Daddy! Mommy! I found something out about the game!

510
00:38:34,419 --> 00:38:36,130
I have something to show everyone.

511
00:38:36,326 --> 00:38:41,055
So far, when a boss monster has appeared at an
event, it has always been at 9:00 p. m.

512
00:38:41,547 --> 00:38:46,152
This is the location where Mommy and Daddy
fought Kagachi the Samurai Lord the other day.

513
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:50,929
And this is the location where Mommy fought last night.

514
00:38:51,008 --> 00:38:54,567
In a few seconds, you'll see the locations
where the other nine bosses appeared.

515
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:58,466
I'll also superimpose a flattened
map of Old Aincrad over it.

516
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:00,940
No way!

517
00:39:01,347 --> 00:39:05,675
Every place a boss showed up in OS lines
up with a dungeon from Old Aincrad!

518
00:39:06,518 --> 00:39:09,457
The admin seem to have picked open spaces in the city,

519
00:39:09,529 --> 00:39:12,135
with coordinates that most closely match the dungeons.

520
00:39:12,191 --> 00:39:14,551
With this, we can make certain predictions.

521
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:20,556
For example, tonight at 9:00, a boss will most
likely appear at the Ebisu Garden Place in Shibuya.

522
00:39:21,262 --> 00:39:22,399
Oh, this is great!

523
00:39:22,686 --> 00:39:24,832
If we know where it's going to be, we can go, too!

524
00:39:24,975 --> 00:39:27,294
Won't your parents mind you're out that late?

525
00:39:27,627 --> 00:39:30,051
Mine won't, as long as I'm hanging with you guys.

526
00:39:30,196 --> 00:39:31,418
They're so weird.

527
00:39:31,443 --> 00:39:33,119
If this was VR, they'd pitch a fit.

528
00:39:33,174 --> 00:39:34,332
Yeah, I bet!

529
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:39,006
Well, have fun, guys.
I have to work tonight, so I can't make it.

530
00:39:39,404 --> 00:39:41,746
How about you? Are you gonna go to this one?

531
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:43,821
Nah. I'll pass on tonight.

532
00:39:43,846 --> 00:39:47,705
Oh, jeez! Are you still not used to fighting in AR?

533
00:39:47,872 --> 00:39:48,682
Nope.

534
00:39:49,067 --> 00:39:50,820
Oh, well, suit yourself.

535
00:39:51,272 --> 00:39:52,116
Darn it.

536
00:39:52,141 --> 00:39:52,582
Huh?

537
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:53,983
All right, ladies!

538
00:39:54,022 --> 00:39:57,923
Let's gear up and show that Yuna chick
how us veteran players like to party!

539
00:39:58,956 --> 00:40:00,298
Yeah!

540
00:40:00,734 --> 00:40:02,364
By the way, where's Klein?

541
00:40:02,435 --> 00:40:07,194
Who knows? He's probably somewhere in Ordinal
, grinding for points, or something.

542
00:40:07,408 --> 00:40:10,347
You know, I saw him last night,
right before the battle started.

543
00:40:10,372 --> 00:40:12,748
But I don't think he ever actually joined it.

544
00:40:12,834 --> 00:40:16,005
They were waiting on one of the
other Fuurinkazan guys to show.

545
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:16,981
Oh, yeah?

546
00:40:17,021 --> 00:40:21,298
What sucks about AR battles is you have
go to an actual place to participate.

547
00:40:21,391 --> 00:40:23,311
Oh, speaking of going places,

548
00:40:23,346 --> 00:40:26,763
we should figure out when we're all going
to meet up to go see the meteor shower.

549
00:40:28,089 --> 00:40:28,970
Shh!

550
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,460
You know what? We should hammer out tonight's plan.

551
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,717
Okay, so where does everyone wanna meet? Ideas?

552
00:40:36,742 --> 00:40:37,219
Yui.

553
00:40:37,482 --> 00:40:38,499
Yes, Daddy?

554
00:40:38,534 --> 00:40:41,795
I wanted to keep the meteor shower
thing a secret from the others.

555
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,525
Ooh! I'm so sorry.

556
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,655
Eh, it's okay. You didn't know.

557
00:40:45,973 --> 00:40:48,895
Anyway, about the boss location data you got,

558
00:40:49,183 --> 00:40:51,089
could you send it to my cell later on?

559
00:40:51,272 --> 00:40:52,978
Yes! I'd be happy to!

560
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:20,796
Hi, Kirito, it's me.

561
00:41:20,907 --> 00:41:22,153
Oh, hey, Asuna.

562
00:41:22,566 --> 00:41:23,646
Hang on a second.

563
00:41:25,737 --> 00:41:27,698
That is some plain pasta.

564
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,207
Yeah, I know.

565
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,575
It's the only recipe my cooking app recommends,

566
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,927
so I'm going with it.

567
00:41:33,069 --> 00:41:36,143
Your diet is so not balanced, it's not even funny.

568
00:41:38,647 --> 00:41:42,545
Here's an idea. How about you make
me some of your ragout rabbit stew?

569
00:41:42,548 --> 00:41:44,112
Right, I'll just whip one up.

570
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:48,353
I know! What if I got some ingredients,
came over and made something like it?

571
00:41:48,378 --> 00:41:50,476
Oh, sure! That'd be great.

572
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:56,355
Hey, so about that ghost you mentioned earlier today.

573
00:41:56,569 --> 00:41:57,111
Huh?

574
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:59,857
You asked if I heard about a ghost in Yoyogi Park?

575
00:41:59,882 --> 00:42:01,185
Oh, right.

576
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,324
Anyway, I did some digging.

577
00:42:03,371 --> 00:42:05,618
Some players say they've seen a ghost.

578
00:42:05,643 --> 00:42:10,321
Not in Yoyogi Park, but in other places.
They say it looks like a young girl in a hoodie.

579
00:42:10,538 --> 00:42:12,103
You're kidding me.

580
00:42:12,145 --> 00:42:14,525
What's wrong? Wait, did you see her?

581
00:42:14,614 --> 00:42:19,577
I didn't! But like, maybe whoever saw
it, just saw an NPC instead! Maybe.

582
00:42:19,816 --> 00:42:21,627
Mm. Maybe...

583
00:42:22,185 --> 00:42:24,814
Oh, by the way, I found the tent and sleeping bag.

584
00:42:24,957 --> 00:42:26,333
They look like they're good to go.

585
00:42:26,366 --> 00:42:27,414
That's great!

586
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:29,615
It's a good thing you have stuff like that.

587
00:42:29,861 --> 00:42:32,394
Oh, don't forget to thank your
dad for letting us borrow them!

588
00:42:32,435 --> 00:42:33,594
Mm. Sure.

589
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:36,350
I can't wait. This'll be fun!

590
00:42:39,366 --> 00:42:42,452
Bye-bye, Klein. Leader of the Fuurinkazan guild.

591
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:48,317
We sure had a big crowd last night, huh?

592
00:42:48,461 --> 00:42:49,842
Yeah, I guess we did.

593
00:42:50,582 --> 00:42:52,297
The next one will be even bigger.

594
00:42:52,601 --> 00:42:53,479
Yeah?

595
00:42:57,695 --> 00:42:59,591
Don't tell me you're interested in this.

596
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:01,600
So many words. It looks boring.

597
00:43:01,782 --> 00:43:04,832
No. It reads like a diary of my memories.

598
00:43:04,857 --> 00:43:06,922
Hm. The swordsman said,

599
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:10,600
"Once I draw my other sword, the battle's over for you."

600
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:13,937
He sounds totally cool!
Come on, read the rest of it to me!

601
00:44:11,008 --> 00:44:12,429
I finally found you.

602
00:44:13,844 --> 00:44:15,517
I didn't know you were looking.

603
00:44:16,123 --> 00:44:18,625
Well, you're not a ghost, that's for sure.

604
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:24,734
Hey, who are you?

605
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:26,910
Is there something you want me to find?

606
00:44:31,824 --> 00:44:32,942
No, wait!

607
00:44:38,437 --> 00:44:39,545
Hello?

608
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,878
Hey, it's me. About time you picked up.

609
00:44:41,903 --> 00:44:44,367
Sorry. I was on the road. What's up?

610
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:47,767
I found Klein. He's in the hospital in Yoyogi.

611
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:51,343
Been there since last night. His arm's all busted up.

612
00:44:51,581 --> 00:44:53,678
What? He get in an accident?

613
00:44:54,051 --> 00:44:58,739
I don't know. He said he ran into some trouble
on the way to one of them Ordinal Scale battles.

614
00:44:58,873 --> 00:45:00,875
That's all I got before he conked out.

615
00:45:01,179 --> 00:45:01,940
Damn.

616
00:45:02,758 --> 00:45:04,245
Let me know when you find out more.

617
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:07,370
Yeah. You be careful on that bike, man.

618
00:45:11,504 --> 00:45:12,338
Daddy?

619
00:45:23,061 --> 00:45:25,751
Gosh, I hope Yuna shows up to this battle.

620
00:45:27,005 --> 00:45:29,790
Silica, what do you think the deal is with Yuna?

621
00:45:30,003 --> 00:45:33,395
I mean, do you think she's a program,
like what the developer says?

622
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,484
Or do you think she might actually be human?

623
00:45:35,716 --> 00:45:39,602
Well, I'm pretty sure she's not a human.

624
00:45:39,718 --> 00:45:42,055
But she also doesn't seem like an AI, either.

625
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:47,457
Hey, if you ask me, I can't think of a single human
that can sing with such a crystal‐clear, flawless voice.

626
00:45:47,482 --> 00:45:50,515
So you're saying my voice isn't crystal‐clear, is that it?

627
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,152
You sound good, for a human.

628
00:45:53,186 --> 00:45:55,863
Liz, I'm never going to karaoke with you again.

629
00:45:56,738 --> 00:45:59,144
Oh, come on. I'm sorry.

630
00:45:59,796 --> 00:46:00,758
It's starting.

631
00:46:18,888 --> 00:46:20,334
Is everyone ready?

632
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:24,393
It's time to battle! So start the music!

633
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:25,838
Yuna!

634
00:46:29,111 --> 00:46:30,551
We so lucked out!

635
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,918
You ladies ready to get tons of points tonight?

636
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,222
Yeah!

637
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,625
I hate it when I have to be the tank!

638
00:46:45,092 --> 00:46:46,203
Our plan worked!

639
00:46:46,425 --> 00:46:48,371
"Worked"? We almost got squashed!

640
00:46:48,706 --> 00:46:51,985
Hot damn! You girls are kicking all the ass out here.

641
00:46:56,348 --> 00:46:58,350
Come on, slow pokes! Try and keep up!

642
00:46:58,493 --> 00:47:01,134
Hey! Those are our points, buster.

643
00:47:06,724 --> 00:47:08,448
Ordinal Scale, activate!

644
00:47:11,253 --> 00:47:12,000
Daddy?

645
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:12,635
Shh.

646
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:16,315
I think I know her from somewhere else.

647
00:47:19,166 --> 00:47:20,716
Your name's Nautilus.

648
00:47:21,065 --> 00:47:23,503
We were in the Knights of the Blood Oath together.

649
00:47:24,317 --> 00:47:27,271
These days, I go by a different name, Asuna.

650
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:30,630
Eiji?

651
00:47:34,938 --> 00:47:36,717
You play this game really well.

652
00:47:36,965 --> 00:47:42,215
I'm not who I used to be. And you've gotten less intense.

653
00:47:42,874 --> 00:47:44,161
Oh, really?

654
00:47:44,439 --> 00:47:46,925
Yeah. Back then, you were tougher.

655
00:47:58,647 --> 00:47:59,830
I know her.

656
00:47:59,855 --> 00:48:01,195
Going down!

657
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,690
It's almost time.

658
00:48:24,697 --> 00:48:27,050
Move in! Everyone, attack!

659
00:48:29,887 --> 00:48:30,744
What the...?

660
00:48:31,648 --> 00:48:33,401
Is another boss showing up?

661
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:39,163
Pina!

662
00:48:39,894 --> 00:48:41,092
It's tiny!

663
00:48:42,572 --> 00:48:44,463
Did you come to help us fight?

664
00:48:57,539 --> 00:48:59,334
Silica! This way!

665
00:49:04,732 --> 00:49:08,012
Daddy! That boss is called Dorcel the Chaos Drake!

666
00:49:08,037 --> 00:49:09,919
It lived way up on Floor 91!

667
00:49:10,251 --> 00:49:11,729
Floor 91?

668
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:14,804
Let me at that thing!

669
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,424
Oh, shit!

670
00:49:19,596 --> 00:49:21,629
Why are you mad at me? What did I do?

671
00:49:22,917 --> 00:49:24,621
I'm sorry‐‐ Ah!

672
00:49:25,665 --> 00:49:26,659
Silica!

673
00:49:28,335 --> 00:49:29,755
Silica!

674
00:49:58,845 --> 00:50:01,450
Asuna? Come on, Asuna, wake up!

675
00:50:05,074 --> 00:50:06,074
Asuna!

676
00:50:07,711 --> 00:50:08,711
Are you okay?

677
00:50:16,975 --> 00:50:18,030
You dick!

678
00:50:19,202 --> 00:50:20,580
What the hell's your prob...?

679
00:50:27,193 --> 00:50:28,415
You're pathetic.

680
00:50:28,678 --> 00:50:31,284
You might've been the greatest swordsman in VR,

681
00:50:31,482 --> 00:50:33,292
but you're nothing in AR.

682
00:50:33,317 --> 00:50:34,476
Son of a bitch!

683
00:50:37,821 --> 00:50:41,556
Hey, you! Ever hear of game etiquette?

684
00:50:54,046 --> 00:50:55,863
Time's up!

685
00:51:02,818 --> 00:51:04,889
See you later!

686
00:51:05,877 --> 00:51:07,647
Wait! What about the bonus?

687
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:10,674
Hey, I thought you were gonna help Asuna!

688
00:51:10,769 --> 00:51:12,580
Please kiss me!

689
00:51:19,082 --> 00:51:21,027
Asuna! Are you okay?

690
00:51:25,504 --> 00:51:26,773
Well, this sucks.

691
00:51:27,154 --> 00:51:28,508
Better luck next time.

692
00:51:32,549 --> 00:51:36,685
I'm sorry, Asuna. This is all because I was being stupid.

693
00:51:37,449 --> 00:51:41,366
Can you believe that number two guy
pushed Silica like that? What an asshole!

694
00:51:41,564 --> 00:51:43,439
Uh‐huh. Nice save, Asuna.

695
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:46,672
That's another reason they made
you second‐in‐command back in...

696
00:51:48,541 --> 00:51:50,510
Hey, what's wrong? Did you get hurt?

697
00:51:50,654 --> 00:51:52,513
Mm‐mm. No, it's nothing.

698
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,538
Want me to take you home?

699
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:56,544
Mm‐hm. We'll help you up.

700
00:51:56,956 --> 00:51:58,235
Hang onto my arm.

701
00:52:00,822 --> 00:52:02,868
Good night, Asuna. I'll call you tomorrow.

702
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:04,948
Kirito?

703
00:52:05,558 --> 00:52:06,544
Yeah, what's up?

704
00:52:07,163 --> 00:52:11,874
I, uh, I was wondering if you
still remembered the day we met.

705
00:52:12,334 --> 00:52:15,617
Sure. It was on Floor 1 of Aincrad.

706
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,856
That boss raid meeting?

707
00:52:17,507 --> 00:52:20,069
Yeah. Right. And then, you...

708
00:52:20,477 --> 00:52:22,720
Then you asked me to join your party, didn't you?

709
00:52:22,863 --> 00:52:26,651
Uh‐huh. I still can't believe I
had the guts to even talk to you.

710
00:52:53,592 --> 00:52:56,753
This is so cool. You can already see the lake from here.

711
00:52:56,816 --> 00:52:58,707
No, you can see the lake, I...

712
00:53:04,157 --> 00:53:07,120
Kirito, you shouldn't be out here on your own!

713
00:53:08,271 --> 00:53:09,288
Kirito?

714
00:53:36,093 --> 00:53:37,072
Kirito!

715
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:41,965
Who are you?

716
00:53:43,206 --> 00:53:44,438
I'm...

717
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:58,691
A dream.

718
00:54:00,619 --> 00:54:01,621
Kirito.

719
00:54:10,339 --> 00:54:11,650
Kirito.

720
00:54:15,661 --> 00:54:17,506
Why can't I remember?

721
00:54:29,756 --> 00:54:30,758
Are you okay?

722
00:54:35,799 --> 00:54:38,136
What's going on? Can't you sleep?

723
00:54:40,028 --> 00:54:41,602
Why are you sitting in the dark?

724
00:54:44,275 --> 00:54:47,238
Thanks for coming. I'm sorry if I woke you.

725
00:54:47,396 --> 00:54:50,421
It's okay. Did something happen?

726
00:54:58,619 --> 00:54:59,954
This cabin...

727
00:55:00,067 --> 00:55:02,351
About how long would you say we've lived here?

728
00:55:02,459 --> 00:55:07,358
Well, we bought it in SAO,
so it's been two and a half years now?

729
00:55:07,779 --> 00:55:09,526
It has, hasn't it?

730
00:55:11,411 --> 00:55:12,673
Asuna?

731
00:55:13,127 --> 00:55:15,710
What...? I knew it. I can't remember.

732
00:55:16,273 --> 00:55:17,983
What do you mean? What?

733
00:55:18,346 --> 00:55:20,262
Everything that happened in Aincrad.

734
00:55:20,381 --> 00:55:21,984
I can't recall any of it.

735
00:55:22,349 --> 00:55:24,061
The first time you and I met.

736
00:55:24,103 --> 00:55:25,559
All the battles we fought.

737
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,245
Us living here together.

738
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:29,488
What the heck are you talking about?

739
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:30,885
You're joking, right?

740
00:55:32,942 --> 00:55:34,706
In the last few hours,

741
00:55:34,737 --> 00:55:37,438
the memories I had of SAO faded away.

742
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:39,447
There's nothing left now.

743
00:55:58,828 --> 00:56:02,832
I'll have to go through all the data
before I can say for certain what happened.

744
00:56:02,911 --> 00:56:04,056
But by the looks of it,

745
00:56:04,081 --> 00:56:08,149
Asuna's brain seems to have undergone
some kind of limited memory scan.

746
00:56:08,336 --> 00:56:09,925
Limited memory scan?

747
00:56:10,131 --> 00:56:13,483
So like, whatever did this only
targeted her memories of SAO ?

748
00:56:13,634 --> 00:56:14,997
How's that even possible?

749
00:56:15,064 --> 00:56:16,702
I can think of one way, actually.

750
00:56:16,837 --> 00:56:18,395
If she were put in a situation,

751
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,747
which forced her to recall moments in SAO ,

752
00:56:21,032 --> 00:56:24,376
the single neurons connected to
those memories would be identified.

753
00:56:24,717 --> 00:56:27,562
Then by showering the neurons with electron pulses,

754
00:56:27,626 --> 00:56:29,461
the image of each memory is scanned.

755
00:56:30,192 --> 00:56:34,783
In the past few days, there've been multiple
reports of people with symptoms similar to Asuna's.

756
00:56:35,339 --> 00:56:37,795
It could be a coincidence, but I doubt it.

757
00:56:38,082 --> 00:56:39,970
Each patient had something in common.

758
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,753
They all played that AR game's event battles.

759
00:56:42,967 --> 00:56:45,683
Then the Augma's causing it.

760
00:56:45,906 --> 00:56:47,715
I can't be certain of that yet.

761
00:56:48,982 --> 00:56:50,786
Is Asuna going to be all right?

762
00:56:50,902 --> 00:56:55,438
Well, as of right now, I don't see any sign
of actual physical damage to her brain.

763
00:56:55,742 --> 00:56:59,320
My theory is, her ability to
recall her memories was affected

764
00:56:59,345 --> 00:57:02,090
because the electron
pulses degenerated her spine.

765
00:57:02,624 --> 00:57:08,200
Unfortunately, I can't tell whether or not she'll
show any further symptoms until I run some more tests.

766
00:57:08,628 --> 00:57:10,083
Wait, so you're saying

767
00:57:10,417 --> 00:57:13,578
there's still a chance she'll
lose even more of her memories?

768
00:57:26,974 --> 00:57:28,618
I'm sorry, Kirito.

769
00:57:29,221 --> 00:57:30,120
Don't worry.

770
00:57:30,446 --> 00:57:33,059
You can still remember what happened lately, right?

771
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:35,270
Mm‐hm.

772
00:57:35,937 --> 00:57:38,573
This doesn't mean you're never gonna remember SAO again.

773
00:57:39,375 --> 00:57:40,662
You will, you'll see.

774
00:57:49,561 --> 00:57:50,323
Asuna?

775
00:57:53,646 --> 00:57:55,066
What's wrong, Asuna?

776
00:57:57,919 --> 00:57:58,975
Asuna!

777
00:58:00,717 --> 00:58:02,130
Are you okay?

778
00:58:37,232 --> 00:58:37,835
Well?

779
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:43,853
I'm sorry, Kirito.

780
00:58:43,968 --> 00:58:46,161
I can't remember anything about SAO.

781
00:58:46,479 --> 00:58:50,474
I remember when we bought this place in
ALO, but not when we first got it.

782
00:58:50,588 --> 00:58:52,827
Everything about SAO 's a blank.

783
00:58:53,598 --> 00:58:54,481
Mommy!

784
00:58:54,743 --> 00:58:55,957
I'm sorry.

785
00:58:56,469 --> 00:58:59,334
I hate that I can't remember the life we had back then.

786
00:58:59,743 --> 00:59:03,814
I'm going to try to find out what's
really going on in Ordinal Scale.

787
00:59:03,997 --> 00:59:07,851
I'm sure I'll find some kind of clue
that'll help you get your memory back.

788
00:59:08,662 --> 00:59:10,870
Mm. Thank you, Yui.

789
00:59:13,813 --> 00:59:19,530
Even if I can't remember it now, this really is
the place we called home back then, isn't it?

790
00:59:20,062 --> 00:59:20,848
Yeah.

791
00:59:27,454 --> 00:59:28,801
I'll go make us some tea.

792
00:59:28,874 --> 00:59:30,263
Oh, I wanna help!

793
00:59:30,345 --> 00:59:32,162
No. I can make it.

794
00:59:32,391 --> 00:59:33,934
The change of pace will do me good.

795
01:00:26,826 --> 01:00:31,121
Now, I'm even more powerful than
Lightning Flash and the Black Swordsman.

796
01:00:31,647 --> 01:00:32,830
Who would've thought?

797
01:00:33,777 --> 01:00:37,097
If it weren't for Ordinal Scale, I'd still be nothing.

798
01:01:10,432 --> 01:01:12,937
Soon, I'll make good on the promise I made her.

799
01:01:20,232 --> 01:01:20,867
Hello?

800
01:01:25,315 --> 01:01:27,006
So how's your arm doing?

801
01:01:27,714 --> 01:01:28,978
Eh, it's not too...

802
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:32,695
I feel worse about making you guys worry.

803
01:01:33,245 --> 01:01:35,945
Do you feel any, I don't know, different?

804
01:01:36,264 --> 01:01:36,891
Huh?

805
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:39,902
Do you remember what happened in SAO ?

806
01:01:42,874 --> 01:01:45,321
No. If I try and think about it,

807
01:01:45,392 --> 01:01:48,162
it's like my head's all stuck in this big‐ass fog.

808
01:01:49,007 --> 01:01:52,914
Well, it's not like it was all
fun and games for us, right?

809
01:01:53,967 --> 01:01:54,777
I don't know.

810
01:01:55,256 --> 01:01:57,135
Maybe it's better I don't remember.

811
01:02:08,785 --> 01:02:11,064
I can't wait. This'll be fun!

812
01:02:22,481 --> 01:02:24,401
Welcome to Augma!

813
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:39,571
Damn!

814
01:02:44,059 --> 01:02:46,434
Launch search for Ordinal Scale rankings.

815
01:03:02,485 --> 01:03:03,263
Hey!

816
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,249
Oh, uh! Sorry.

817
01:03:07,068 --> 01:03:07,957
Let's go, man.

818
01:03:07,982 --> 01:03:08,616
Yeah.

819
01:03:15,085 --> 01:03:20,240
I can't tell if it's a side effect due to a glitch
in the system, or a deliberately designed feature.

820
01:03:20,631 --> 01:03:23,465
If it's the latter and someone did this intentionally,

821
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:25,539
I'm afraid this is only the beginning.

822
01:03:25,634 --> 01:03:26,874
Let me get this straight.

823
01:03:27,352 --> 01:03:30,864
You're saying that if any of the other
SAO survivors play Ordinal Scale,

824
01:03:30,889 --> 01:03:33,062
there's a chance they'll lose their memories, too.

825
01:03:33,111 --> 01:03:34,208
Just like Asuna?

826
01:03:36,424 --> 01:03:39,601
If I'm not careful, it could happen to me, too.

827
01:03:40,936 --> 01:03:43,559
If I can't remember those two years with her,

828
01:03:43,964 --> 01:03:45,898
will I also forget I love her?

829
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:48,731
I'm sorry, Daddy!

830
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:51,136
I couldn't find the player called Eiji.

831
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:54,289
I used his name and visual data from the last battle,

832
01:03:54,395 --> 01:03:56,419
but the search didn't turn up a thing.

833
01:03:56,595 --> 01:03:57,397
Oh, well...

834
01:03:57,478 --> 01:03:58,630
Don't give up, Daddy.

835
01:03:58,655 --> 01:04:01,021
While you're fighting the boss, I'll be gathering data.

836
01:04:01,053 --> 01:04:02,902
I'm sure I'll find something to go on!

837
01:04:02,927 --> 01:04:03,857
I know you will.

838
01:04:03,968 --> 01:04:05,208
I'm counting on you.

839
01:04:05,233 --> 01:04:05,688
Right.

840
01:04:05,892 --> 01:04:07,705
Well, well! Look who it is.

841
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:08,028
Huh?

842
01:04:09,355 --> 01:04:10,634
What are you doing here?

843
01:04:10,978 --> 01:04:12,694
What are you doing here?

844
01:04:12,805 --> 01:04:16,235
You just told everyone not to
fight the bosses and here you are.

845
01:04:16,338 --> 01:04:19,079
I know. But it really is dangerous.

846
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:22,473
If a boss kills you, you'll lose your memory like Asuna.

847
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:23,641
I'll be fine.

848
01:04:23,847 --> 01:04:26,468
I'm not an SAO survivor like you guys.

849
01:04:26,579 --> 01:04:30,822
If I don't have those memories to scan,
nothing's gonna happen to me. Right, Yui?

850
01:04:31,139 --> 01:04:34,340
Yes. You should be safe. I think.

851
01:04:34,365 --> 01:04:35,246
Yeah, but we don't know if...

852
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:38,888
If you're really that worried,
then you'll just have to keep me safe, won't you?

853
01:04:39,007 --> 01:04:41,374
If anyone can keep her safe, it's you, Daddy.

854
01:04:46,556 --> 01:04:48,754
Ordinal Scale, activate!

855
01:05:01,173 --> 01:05:02,183
What the‐‐?

856
01:05:02,278 --> 01:05:05,233
That's Dire Tusk, the boss from Floor 18!

857
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:07,520
What happened to Floor 13's boss?

858
01:05:07,673 --> 01:05:12,479
I just checked and a total of ten monsters have
appeared at different locations across the city!

859
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:14,593
They're pulling out all the stops tonight.

860
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:18,484
Dire Tusk is here, because the
admin shuffled the locations around!

861
01:05:21,188 --> 01:05:22,925
Crap, that's Dire Tusk, all right.

862
01:05:22,967 --> 01:05:23,799
Come on!

863
01:05:35,201 --> 01:05:37,393
It's gonna wind up for an attack next.

864
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:39,213
Then let's light him up!

865
01:05:43,083 --> 01:05:45,061
Awesome! He's like a sitting duck!

866
01:05:46,268 --> 01:05:47,340
No, get away!

867
01:05:58,615 --> 01:05:59,472
Oh, crap!

868
01:06:31,124 --> 01:06:32,126
Pace yourself!

869
01:07:16,793 --> 01:07:18,206
He didn't show up tonight.

870
01:07:18,605 --> 01:07:19,675
Nice one.

871
01:07:19,939 --> 01:07:21,370
Yeah. Thanks to you.

872
01:07:21,425 --> 01:07:23,664
Take me out for cake and we'll call it even.

873
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:26,041
How about a coupon for a free beef bowl instead?

874
01:07:26,176 --> 01:07:28,009
Do I look like I want a beef bowl?

875
01:07:28,098 --> 01:07:30,751
I'll settle for a ride home on your bike, cheapskate.

876
01:07:32,905 --> 01:07:33,675
Yuuna?

877
01:07:38,347 --> 01:07:39,406
Hey, wait!

878
01:07:39,912 --> 01:07:40,993
Who are you?

879
01:07:46,498 --> 01:07:47,635
I'm sorry, Daddy.

880
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:50,552
I was following a clue, but I got blocked by a firewall.

881
01:07:50,742 --> 01:07:52,077
During the battle just now,

882
01:07:52,172 --> 01:07:54,896
I found out that a mysterious program activated

883
01:07:54,938 --> 01:07:58,616
right when a SAO survivor took
on critical damage from the boss.

884
01:07:58,758 --> 01:07:59,893
Son of a...

885
01:08:02,532 --> 01:08:03,794
You want a drink?

886
01:08:03,931 --> 01:08:04,611
Mm‐mm.

887
01:08:16,856 --> 01:08:18,023
Look for...

888
01:08:18,746 --> 01:08:19,779
Of course!

889
01:08:19,914 --> 01:08:21,533
Yui! That girl in the hoodie.

890
01:08:21,709 --> 01:08:24,174
You know which direction she
pointed each time we saw her?

891
01:08:24,199 --> 01:08:26,009
Yes, I have the coordinates.

892
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,630
Bring up a map of Tokyo and show me where they all lead.

893
01:08:35,385 --> 01:08:38,012
They crisscross in Ookayama!

894
01:08:38,107 --> 01:08:39,792
You know what that building is, Yui?

895
01:08:39,986 --> 01:08:43,034
That's where the Touto University of Engineering is.

896
01:08:43,827 --> 01:08:45,648
Why does she want me to look there?

897
01:08:45,838 --> 01:08:48,938
I'll cross‐reference the school's
database and the player called Eiji.

898
01:08:49,065 --> 01:08:50,340
It'll just take a second.

899
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:55,482
I know this guy.

900
01:08:56,223 --> 01:08:58,356
That's Professor Tetsuhiro Shigemura.

901
01:08:58,495 --> 01:08:59,732
He designed the Augma.

902
01:09:02,095 --> 01:09:03,705
He did, huh?

903
01:09:07,146 --> 01:09:13,462
Based on the evidence, the most glaring flaw in a
FullDive VR device is the FullDive function itself.

904
01:09:14,266 --> 01:09:18,433
When a person has to sever their
physical senses to play a VR game,

905
01:09:18,458 --> 01:09:21,802
that person is taking on
incalculable risks to their health.

906
01:09:22,346 --> 01:09:27,552
True, FullDive tech has been applied to activities
other than gaming such as communication,

907
01:09:27,695 --> 01:09:29,728
browsing, and digital production.

908
01:09:30,244 --> 01:09:33,320
But none of those activities require all of one's senses.

909
01:09:33,486 --> 01:09:36,791
Sight, sound and limited tactile information are enough.

910
01:09:36,973 --> 01:09:39,666
So instead of using a dangerous FullDive device,

911
01:09:39,691 --> 01:09:41,820
one should use an AR device,

912
01:09:41,891 --> 01:09:44,027
which has been proven to be safe and stable.

913
01:09:46,118 --> 01:09:48,881
Are there any questions on what we've covered so far?

914
01:09:51,782 --> 01:09:53,049
Yes. You there.

915
01:09:54,738 --> 01:09:59,719
Professor, would you say AR devices have
certain risks that VR devices don't?

916
01:09:59,982 --> 01:10:01,920
If so, what are your thoughts on that?

917
01:10:02,039 --> 01:10:06,659
Yes, well, are you talking about traffic
accidents, while wearing an AR device?

918
01:10:06,751 --> 01:10:12,860
No. I'm talking about risks like permanently altering
and damaging the user's perception of reality.

919
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:16,570
FullDive tech just makes a
virtual world seem like reality.

920
01:10:16,763 --> 01:10:18,898
But AR tech alters reality itself.

921
01:10:18,993 --> 01:10:20,628
Don't you think that's dangerous?

922
01:10:24,115 --> 01:10:26,198
I'll answer that question next time.

923
01:10:26,484 --> 01:10:27,827
Class dismissed.

924
01:10:28,556 --> 01:10:30,161
I'll cut right to the chase.

925
01:10:30,677 --> 01:10:32,497
Do you know someone named Eiji?

926
01:10:32,616 --> 01:10:34,785
He's the second rank player in Ordinal Scale.

927
01:10:35,301 --> 01:10:36,049
No.

928
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,877
But he was in your class and he even took your lab.

929
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:41,354
I've had many students over the years.

930
01:10:41,379 --> 01:10:43,151
Okay, let's try a different question.

931
01:10:43,176 --> 01:10:47,320
Did you know that the Augma is causing
SAO survivors to lose their memories?

932
01:10:47,942 --> 01:10:51,081
Did you know the Augma has a
feature users don't know about?

933
01:10:51,106 --> 01:10:53,734
A feature that scans their brain while they're wearing it?

934
01:10:55,807 --> 01:10:58,111
I didn't know I was going to be interrogated.

935
01:10:58,136 --> 01:11:00,478
Kikuoka told me you just wanted to audit my class.

936
01:11:00,503 --> 01:11:03,219
If the Augma does have a dangerous feature built in,

937
01:11:03,545 --> 01:11:05,540
it won't be long before it's found out.

938
01:11:06,056 --> 01:11:10,378
And once that happens, the Augma's gonna be
banned, just like the NerveGear was.

939
01:11:10,545 --> 01:11:11,348
And you?

940
01:11:11,547 --> 01:11:14,874
You'll end up the same as your former
student, Akihiko Kayaba.

941
01:11:15,672 --> 01:11:17,766
I don't know what you're talking about.

942
01:11:18,179 --> 01:11:21,789
But let's say the Augma has this
brain‐scanning function you described,

943
01:11:21,814 --> 01:11:24,505
why is it bad if someone forgets about SAO ?

944
01:11:24,608 --> 01:11:25,935
In the words of Nietzsche,

945
01:11:26,435 --> 01:11:27,896
"Blessed are the forgetful,

946
01:11:27,947 --> 01:11:30,138
for they get the better even of their blunders."

947
01:11:30,233 --> 01:11:35,371
So now ask yourself, do you think those
survivors want to remember their horrifying past?

948
01:11:36,414 --> 01:11:38,821
If you wish to speak further, make an appointment.

949
01:11:39,249 --> 01:11:40,402
I'm very busy, though,

950
01:11:40,427 --> 01:11:42,571
so there's no guarantee I'll be able to see you.

951
01:11:52,147 --> 01:11:54,583
I didn't know you built robots too, professor.

952
01:11:56,107 --> 01:11:57,109
Thanks for your time.

953
01:12:04,896 --> 01:12:07,748
That's right. Dr. Shigemura has a daughter.

954
01:12:08,462 --> 01:12:11,618
Or rather, had. She died two years ago.

955
01:12:13,078 --> 01:12:14,159
Yuuna?

956
01:12:14,486 --> 01:12:16,877
I'm sure you put two‐and‐two together already,

957
01:12:16,933 --> 01:12:18,688
but I might as well confirm it for you.

958
01:12:19,148 --> 01:12:20,864
The cause of death was the NerveGear.

959
01:12:21,205 --> 01:12:22,771
She was a victim of SAO.

960
01:12:23,001 --> 01:12:25,472
Huh? Why would he do this?

961
01:12:26,115 --> 01:12:27,665
What the hell's he trying to prove?

962
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:32,441
Well, maybe he honestly thinks he's doing
good by making the SAO survivors forget.

963
01:12:32,901 --> 01:12:37,787
Yeah, well, I can't prove it yet,
but I'm sure the Augma's dangerous to users.

964
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,130
I need your help.

965
01:12:39,424 --> 01:12:42,126
Please, Mr. Kikuoka. Shut down the service.

966
01:12:42,541 --> 01:12:47,139
The Ministry of Economy is tied up with this,
so we have to be careful with how we proceed.

967
01:12:47,974 --> 01:12:50,103
I am looking into everything you've told me.

968
01:12:50,683 --> 01:12:52,492
But I can't move without proof.

969
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:56,173
A bunch of the Ordinal Scale players are SAO survivors.

970
01:12:56,657 --> 01:12:59,337
And if they fight any of the bosses from Old Aincrad,

971
01:12:59,517 --> 01:13:02,068
you're gonna have a lot more people losing their memories.

972
01:13:02,093 --> 01:13:04,213
I know and I'm doing the best I can.

973
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:08,843
I checked with the hospital about Klein and his
friends and confirmed their symptoms with the doctors.

974
01:13:09,401 --> 01:13:12,055
But I'm more concerned about their
broken bones than their memories.

975
01:13:12,801 --> 01:13:15,510
You should take your own advice
and don't fight any more bosses.

976
01:13:16,329 --> 01:13:18,101
Your memories are important to me, too.

977
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:19,125
Don't forget that.

978
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:38,544
Hey, what's up?

979
01:13:39,053 --> 01:13:41,626
Nothing. I just wanted to hear your voice.

980
01:13:41,881 --> 01:13:42,682
Oh.

981
01:13:44,899 --> 01:13:46,113
Listen, Asuna.

982
01:13:46,447 --> 01:13:47,998
Is it cool if I come over?

983
01:13:48,196 --> 01:13:48,704
Now?

984
01:13:48,894 --> 01:13:51,367
Um, yeah. Or later, if that's better.

985
01:13:51,621 --> 01:13:53,297
No, now's fine.

986
01:13:53,448 --> 01:13:56,243
I'd come to you, but I'm kind of scared to go outside.

987
01:13:56,348 --> 01:13:59,320
No, I get it. I'll be at your
place in about 20 minutes.

988
01:13:59,519 --> 01:14:02,688
I'm in Ookayama right now, but traffic's not too bad.

989
01:14:03,842 --> 01:14:06,384
Sorry. The door was already open.

990
01:14:06,455 --> 01:14:09,147
Heh, why do you sound so nervous? It's okay!

991
01:14:09,290 --> 01:14:10,605
My parents are both at work.

992
01:14:10,649 --> 01:14:12,901
Yeah, but it's my first time here.

993
01:14:13,056 --> 01:14:16,480
Oh, crap. I should've brought your
folks a gift. Like a plant, or something.

994
01:14:16,917 --> 01:14:18,902
Don't be silly! It's fine, I swear.

995
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:20,198
Come on, this way.

996
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:28,230
I was talking to someone today and they said survivors
like us are better off forgetting what happened in SAO.

997
01:14:28,294 --> 01:14:31,209
I got to thinking and maybe he's got a point there.

998
01:14:31,891 --> 01:14:33,818
We saw a lot of horrible things happen.

999
01:14:33,973 --> 01:14:36,396
It was scary and sad.

1000
01:14:36,459 --> 01:14:42,836
But the memories we have of those two years, good and
bad, are what shaped us into the people we are today.

1001
01:14:47,593 --> 01:14:50,852
Everyone's been telling me about
how high‐tech your room is.

1002
01:14:51,349 --> 01:14:52,873
It's not what I thought.

1003
01:14:53,217 --> 01:14:56,362
In a way, it sort of reminds me
about your place in Selmburg.

1004
01:14:57,825 --> 01:15:00,112
I'll go bring us up some drinks and snacks.

1005
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:01,106
Yeah, sure.

1006
01:15:01,131 --> 01:15:02,567
Make yourself at home, okay?

1007
01:15:30,862 --> 01:15:31,831
Uh...

1008
01:15:32,775 --> 01:15:34,190
To the future me.

1009
01:15:34,658 --> 01:15:37,319
It's been a long time since I've written in this diary.

1010
01:15:37,553 --> 01:15:41,474
These days, I'm worried I'll forget what's
happened to me since I came back to the real world,

1011
01:15:41,775 --> 01:15:44,399
so I'll write how I feel now in case I do.

1012
01:15:45,343 --> 01:15:47,361
I met Kirito four years ago,

1013
01:15:47,575 --> 01:15:49,496
but I only remember the last two.

1014
01:15:49,909 --> 01:15:54,476
The moments with him, I can still
remember, are precious, like jewels.

1015
01:15:55,454 --> 01:15:59,167
There's a good chance Ordinal Scale will
cause me to forget things more and more.

1016
01:15:59,689 --> 01:16:00,929
And that scares me.

1017
01:16:01,415 --> 01:16:04,464
But as long as I can keep making new memories with Kirito,

1018
01:16:04,988 --> 01:16:06,036
I should be fine.

1019
01:16:07,149 --> 01:16:13,140
My calendar says I'm supposed to go to the mountains in
Saitama in a couple of days to watch the stars with him.

1020
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:17,361
But I don't remember the day we
made plans to go there anymore.

1021
01:16:18,702 --> 01:16:21,880
I went back and read this diary and from what I can tell,

1022
01:16:22,034 --> 01:16:25,025
Kirito said he wanted to give me some kind of present.

1023
01:16:25,542 --> 01:16:28,219
I hope he'll forgive me for not remembering what.

1024
01:16:30,205 --> 01:16:31,470
I want to get him something,

1025
01:16:31,512 --> 01:16:33,701
but since I'm not allowed to have a job yet,

1026
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:37,857
I'm going to use all my points and
whatever I have saved to buy him a gift.

1027
01:16:40,073 --> 01:16:44,045
My beloved Kirito. What will I do if I forget him?

1028
01:16:44,587 --> 01:16:47,303
What will I do if I forget these feelings I have?

1029
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:50,774
And what if it turns out I can't
make new memories with him?

1030
01:16:52,261 --> 01:16:54,493
It scares me to even think about it.

1031
01:16:55,249 --> 01:16:57,806
I pray that the person I am tomorrow

1032
01:16:58,028 --> 01:17:00,673
doesn't forget the feelings I have for him now.

1033
01:17:07,291 --> 01:17:10,256
It's okay. You can read the whole thing if you want.

1034
01:17:26,807 --> 01:17:30,395
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1035
01:17:33,051 --> 01:17:36,148
I love you, Kirito. So much.

1036
01:17:37,531 --> 01:17:40,581
Even if I forgot everything that happened in SAO ,

1037
01:17:40,898 --> 01:17:43,909
my feelings for you will never ever change.

1038
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:49,201
They won't for me, either. I love you.

1039
01:17:49,711 --> 01:17:51,785
Always have. Always will.

1040
01:17:58,974 --> 01:17:59,957
I know.

1041
01:18:04,405 --> 01:18:08,540
I'm gonna get your memories
back, no matter what. I promise.

1042
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:10,580
You know I won't let you down, right?

1043
01:18:12,655 --> 01:18:13,282
Mm‐hm.

1044
01:18:15,810 --> 01:18:17,348
Oh, a shooting star.

1045
01:18:17,985 --> 01:18:20,271
Well, Eiji, tomorrow's the big day.

1046
01:18:20,385 --> 01:18:24,310
I get to be on stage in an enormous
arena and sing for everyone.

1047
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:26,534
Yeah. You nervous about it?

1048
01:18:26,621 --> 01:18:27,861
No. Not at all.

1049
01:18:27,988 --> 01:18:32,088
I finally get my chance to sing for
a huge audience. How cool is that?

1050
01:18:32,413 --> 01:18:35,647
This performance is gonna make
me the world's number one diva.

1051
01:18:35,695 --> 01:18:36,481
That's right.

1052
01:18:36,713 --> 01:18:40,153
Tomorrow's going to make you the
biggest and brightest star of them all.

1053
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:42,830
Hey! Would you please read some more of that book to me?

1054
01:18:43,338 --> 01:18:44,752
Sure. You got it.

1055
01:18:45,635 --> 01:18:48,257
This time, could you find the
part in it where you show up?

1056
01:18:48,297 --> 01:18:49,733
I wanna hear about you.

1057
01:18:51,029 --> 01:18:51,998
I'm not in it.

1058
01:18:52,023 --> 01:18:52,335
Huh?

1059
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,484
I don't show up anywhere in this thing.

1060
01:18:55,097 --> 01:18:59,100
I guess folks like us, the ones who couldn't
fight, aren't worth remembering.

1061
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:01,237
Yes?

1062
01:19:04,266 --> 01:19:06,488
You're taking far too long getting this done.

1063
01:19:07,228 --> 01:19:10,255
Someone's caught on to our plan. You need to hurry.

1064
01:19:10,485 --> 01:19:12,233
Yes. I know that, sir.

1065
01:19:12,551 --> 01:19:15,840
I made sure all the pieces are
in place for the final stage.

1066
01:19:16,228 --> 01:19:18,879
You're not having second
thoughts about our deal, are you?

1067
01:19:19,034 --> 01:19:21,425
Not as long as you hold up your end of it.

1068
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:22,704
I will, sir.

1069
01:19:23,189 --> 01:19:25,150
By the way, about Yuna...

1070
01:19:25,295 --> 01:19:29,409
Lately, it seems like she has other
things on her mind besides singing.

1071
01:19:29,505 --> 01:19:32,128
That's probably her self‐preservation program.

1072
01:19:32,421 --> 01:19:35,129
If anything, it's proof the plan is going smoothly.

1073
01:19:36,142 --> 01:19:37,479
If you say so.

1074
01:20:56,625 --> 01:20:57,836
Yuuna, right?

1075
01:20:59,338 --> 01:21:01,134
So where is this place?

1076
01:21:01,325 --> 01:21:03,311
Is it a dream? The virtual world?

1077
01:21:03,336 --> 01:21:06,577
Dreams and virtual worlds are
the same thing, more or less.

1078
01:21:06,831 --> 01:21:10,652
The second you wake up,
the experience becomes a fleeting memory.

1079
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:11,876
I guess.

1080
01:21:12,209 --> 01:21:14,982
Here's a thought, maybe it's all just a dream.

1081
01:21:15,148 --> 01:21:18,961
Everything like clearing that death
game and coming back to the real world.

1082
01:21:19,026 --> 01:21:23,136
And what if, when you open your eyes,
you wake up trapped in Aincrad again?

1083
01:21:23,562 --> 01:21:25,208
Did you ever think about that?

1084
01:21:26,855 --> 01:21:30,007
I have, but I never wished it was true, not even once.

1085
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:33,225
And by the sound of it, you're an SAO survivor, too.

1086
01:21:34,377 --> 01:21:36,458
Are you Professor Shigemura's daughter?

1087
01:21:36,632 --> 01:21:37,951
Are you still alive?

1088
01:21:39,429 --> 01:21:42,892
Why'd you send me to your dad? What do you want me to do?

1089
01:21:43,354 --> 01:21:46,394
Why would your dad wanna steal Asuna's memories of SAO ?

1090
01:21:46,775 --> 01:21:48,353
What's the Augma really for?

1091
01:22:07,211 --> 01:22:08,425
That song!

1092
01:22:15,291 --> 01:22:19,477
All I want is to go on singing. It's all I ever wanted.

1093
01:22:19,897 --> 01:22:21,471
And I wanna save Asuna.

1094
01:22:21,629 --> 01:22:24,005
So are you gonna tell me how or not?

1095
01:22:24,203 --> 01:22:27,007
Getting her memories back isn't going to be easy.

1096
01:22:27,364 --> 01:22:30,463
The rank you have now isn't nearly high enough to do it.

1097
01:22:30,939 --> 01:22:33,586
Well? Don't just stand there. Wake up.

1098
01:22:35,612 --> 01:22:38,074
Whoa, easy! You okay, guy?

1099
01:22:38,788 --> 01:22:39,594
Yeah.

1100
01:22:40,214 --> 01:22:42,406
What, you fell asleep playing that Augma game?

1101
01:22:42,969 --> 01:22:45,677
Seems like everybody's got one of those things these days.

1102
01:22:45,853 --> 01:22:47,764
Careful you don't fall on your face.

1103
01:23:03,809 --> 01:23:05,049
You wanna know the truth,

1104
01:23:05,074 --> 01:23:07,519
I think Silica blames herself for what happened.

1105
01:23:07,677 --> 01:23:08,971
I didn't even know.

1106
01:23:09,282 --> 01:23:11,849
If only I could've gone to one of those battles.

1107
01:23:12,755 --> 01:23:15,820
Klein got himself hurt at one
and ended up in the hospital.

1108
01:23:16,067 --> 01:23:17,866
It's probably better you stayed away.

1109
01:23:17,975 --> 01:23:18,904
You said it.

1110
01:23:19,035 --> 01:23:22,748
Kirito told everyone not fight the
bosses in OS because it's so dangerous.

1111
01:23:22,788 --> 01:23:24,807
And then, he goes to fight them by himself.

1112
01:23:24,982 --> 01:23:27,215
I sort of helped him on the last one, though.

1113
01:23:28,614 --> 01:23:29,861
But then, you know what?

1114
01:23:29,886 --> 01:23:32,428
I'm gonna make a video to teach him some kendo moves.

1115
01:23:32,453 --> 01:23:34,608
Then he'll cruise through those battles, no sweat.

1116
01:23:34,873 --> 01:23:37,989
Mm‐hm. Violence brings siblings together.

1117
01:23:38,031 --> 01:23:38,990
Come on!

1118
01:23:39,015 --> 01:23:40,618
We're singing the next song together.

1119
01:23:40,777 --> 01:23:43,626
We're here to practice, remember?
The concert's tomorrow!

1120
01:23:43,764 --> 01:23:45,494
Take the mic and get in here.

1121
01:23:48,143 --> 01:23:50,295
I don't know if this is cheering her up.

1122
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:55,436
What do you mean?
It looks like Asuna's having fun.

1123
01:23:55,872 --> 01:23:57,406
If you say so...

1124
01:24:05,534 --> 01:24:06,835
Dude, you okay?

1125
01:24:06,881 --> 01:24:07,843
What's wrong?

1126
01:24:16,118 --> 01:24:18,674
Multiple bosses have appeared,
just like last night.

1127
01:24:18,785 --> 01:24:21,382
But this time, it's the ones from Floors 20 to 30.

1128
01:24:21,747 --> 01:24:23,964
I'm gonna take all of them down tonight.

1129
01:24:36,279 --> 01:24:39,730
I can't believe he's knocking down its HP all by himself.

1130
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:41,282
He's a badass.

1131
01:24:46,377 --> 01:24:47,838
Jeez! Chill out!

1132
01:24:48,116 --> 01:24:50,217
What are you getting so worked up for?

1133
01:24:50,444 --> 01:24:51,636
It's only a game.

1134
01:24:55,427 --> 01:24:56,345
Move!

1135
01:25:03,786 --> 01:25:07,996
It's time for a bonus stage. Good luck, everyone.

1136
01:25:08,464 --> 01:25:10,257
We totally scored!

1137
01:25:48,668 --> 01:25:50,707
Congratulations.

1138
01:25:51,724 --> 01:25:56,372
It looks like you finally learned how to
handle yourself in this game, Black Swordsman.

1139
01:25:56,983 --> 01:25:58,033
You bastard!

1140
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:12,700
Instead of Yuna rewarding you, I will.

1141
01:26:57,987 --> 01:27:01,338
Wow. Yuna's more popular than I thought.

1142
01:27:01,363 --> 01:27:04,063
Ugh. My throat's sore from karaoke.

1143
01:27:04,301 --> 01:27:06,066
That's what you get for overdoing it.

1144
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:08,636
Silica, thank you for yesterday.

1145
01:27:08,661 --> 01:27:09,846
Oh, sure!

1146
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:13,358
Oh, man. Wish Klein and Suguha could be here.

1147
01:27:13,771 --> 01:27:15,525
Wait. Where's Kirito?

1148
01:27:15,599 --> 01:27:18,206
He said he was going to stop by the restroom first.

1149
01:27:27,572 --> 01:27:29,667
Okay, I'm here like you wanted.

1150
01:27:31,942 --> 01:27:34,978
You're gonna give me her memory
back, or do I have to take it?

1151
01:27:35,003 --> 01:27:37,749
What's the rush, Black Swordsman?

1152
01:27:37,927 --> 01:27:40,307
You called yourself Nautilus back then.

1153
01:27:40,483 --> 01:27:43,850
Cool name for a guy who wouldn't
fight, 'coz he was too scared of dying.

1154
01:27:43,875 --> 01:27:45,519
I'm called Eiji now!

1155
01:27:48,837 --> 01:27:50,676
Guess I can't escape my past.

1156
01:27:51,128 --> 01:27:53,456
I'm surprised you remember a little runt like me.

1157
01:27:53,481 --> 01:27:56,198
Actually, I don't remember you. A friend did.

1158
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:59,097
Hmm? A friend, like Asuna, I bet.

1159
01:27:59,263 --> 01:28:02,537
It's not enough you have her,
you probably want Yuuna, too.

1160
01:28:02,712 --> 01:28:04,230
What are you talking about?

1161
01:28:04,255 --> 01:28:05,056
Never mind.

1162
01:28:05,357 --> 01:28:06,884
You think you're so cool.

1163
01:28:06,963 --> 01:28:09,513
You know, there's a reason I'm ranked second in this game.

1164
01:28:09,538 --> 01:28:11,213
Do you really think you can beat me?

1165
01:28:11,238 --> 01:28:13,041
I won't know until I try.

1166
01:28:13,318 --> 01:28:15,543
Besides, it's not like you're number one.

1167
01:28:21,408 --> 01:28:23,545
Ordinal Scale, activate!

1168
01:29:09,895 --> 01:29:11,746
I wish I could change things.

1169
01:29:12,436 --> 01:29:15,663
I used my position as chairman
of Argus' board of directors,

1170
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:18,752
to get Yuuna a NerveGear and a copy of SAO.

1171
01:29:19,459 --> 01:29:22,066
I was just trying to make my daughter happy.

1172
01:29:22,887 --> 01:29:26,403
But in the end, it was
  my stupidity that killed her.

1173
01:29:27,413 --> 01:29:28,290
Yuuna!

1174
01:29:36,217 --> 01:29:39,488
Hah! I can see how everyone believed you'd clear SAO.

1175
01:29:39,513 --> 01:29:44,054
You've got some moves! Wish I could say
the same about you. Second rank my ass!

1176
01:29:48,294 --> 01:29:51,402
People only remember the players
who fought on the front lines.

1177
01:29:51,444 --> 01:29:53,875
But Yuuna and me? We didn't fight,

1178
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:56,747
so we get treated like we didn't even exist!

1179
01:29:56,788 --> 01:29:58,959
Wait, you guys were together in SAO ?

1180
01:29:59,001 --> 01:30:00,781
That's right!

1181
01:30:01,719 --> 01:30:04,673
And I was with her at the end. I watched her vanish!

1182
01:30:05,112 --> 01:30:07,574
I hated myself for being so weak!

1183
01:30:07,637 --> 01:30:11,896
The girl I loved was in danger and I
couldn't lift a finger to save her!

1184
01:30:13,645 --> 01:30:17,181
Her brain had become so damaged
by the effects of the NerveGear,

1185
01:30:17,555 --> 01:30:19,247
it was impossible to save her.

1186
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:22,528
But if I could acquire the memories of her

1187
01:30:22,559 --> 01:30:26,475
from the other SAO players and find a way to combine them,

1188
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:29,247
the Deep Learning function would do the rest.

1189
01:30:29,669 --> 01:30:33,228
And it could give my daughter new life, as an AI.

1190
01:30:44,511 --> 01:30:47,282
The numbers in the Ordinal System are absolute.

1191
01:30:47,623 --> 01:30:50,548
Whoever is ranked number one becomes immortal.

1192
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:53,916
After all, that's how you designed it, Kayaba.

1193
01:30:56,157 --> 01:31:00,708
Yuna, is it? It sounds like
"una", the Latin word for "one".

1194
01:31:01,512 --> 01:31:04,827
Aincrad was controlled by a
system using cardinal numbers.

1195
01:31:05,017 --> 01:31:08,497
Ordinal Scale is controlled by
a system using ordinal numbers.

1196
01:31:09,514 --> 01:31:13,240
A system I originally developed for
SAO, but discarded early on.

1197
01:31:13,694 --> 01:31:15,613
It seems you resurrected it, doctor,

1198
01:31:15,727 --> 01:31:17,300
and developed a new game.

1199
01:31:18,236 --> 01:31:21,763
The man I used to be would've done the
same, had I been in your place.

1200
01:31:22,107 --> 01:31:23,337
But now, doctor,

1201
01:31:23,616 --> 01:31:26,580
the man I've become believes in something greater.

1202
01:31:27,770 --> 01:31:31,020
An existence that can transcend the system itself.

1203
01:31:34,693 --> 01:31:37,837
Who cares if we take away everyone's memories of SAO ?

1204
01:31:37,862 --> 01:31:39,523
We're doing them a favor!

1205
01:31:41,074 --> 01:31:43,496
Let's see how good you are without this!

1206
01:31:47,113 --> 01:31:49,326
Goddamn you!

1207
01:31:59,067 --> 01:32:00,642
We all suffered back then.

1208
01:32:00,785 --> 01:32:04,714
But I won't lose to a guy that rejects the
past, because he thinks he suffered more.

1209
01:32:07,258 --> 01:32:10,713
Are you gonna give me Asuna's memory
back, or do you wanna keep going?

1210
01:32:48,622 --> 01:32:50,000
That was so fun!

1211
01:33:20,765 --> 01:33:22,230
It's too late now.

1212
01:33:22,455 --> 01:33:25,750
Practically every SAO survivor is upstairs.

1213
01:33:27,028 --> 01:33:28,173
In a few minutes,

1214
01:33:28,198 --> 01:33:32,550
we're going to start scanning the brains of
every survivor and take their memories of SAO.

1215
01:33:32,581 --> 01:33:34,607
Their memories of that hell.

1216
01:33:34,933 --> 01:33:37,145
And then we'll bring Yuuna back to life.

1217
01:33:37,187 --> 01:33:39,478
Huh? What're you talking about?

1218
01:33:39,567 --> 01:33:42,123
Like I said. It's too late now.

1219
01:33:42,338 --> 01:33:44,349
And you can't stop it.

1220
01:33:51,899 --> 01:33:55,783
Okay, so here's what I learned from Kamura,
the company that manufactures the Augma.

1221
01:33:56,116 --> 01:33:59,477
The drones flying inside the stadium
are equipped with a special function.

1222
01:33:59,717 --> 01:34:03,537
According to my source, they can boost
the output of the Augmas wirelessly.

1223
01:34:03,562 --> 01:34:05,104
So, what does that mean?

1224
01:34:05,129 --> 01:34:08,035
It means if they run that brain scan inside the stadium,

1225
01:34:08,177 --> 01:34:11,530
we might be dealing with something worse
than just partial memory loss.

1226
01:34:12,825 --> 01:34:13,927
Holy shit!

1227
01:34:13,970 --> 01:34:14,676
You said it.

1228
01:34:15,226 --> 01:34:20,434
The scan could permanently damage the brain and
might even kill people, just like the NerveGear.

1229
01:34:29,542 --> 01:34:30,550
I'll get the professor.

1230
01:34:30,908 --> 01:34:33,376
You get everyone to take off their Augmas.

1231
01:34:33,812 --> 01:34:35,259
Hopefully, they'll listen to you.

1232
01:34:38,806 --> 01:34:40,214
Oh, my God!

1233
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:42,220
Is this part of the show?

1234
01:34:43,862 --> 01:34:44,945
Let us out!

1235
01:34:44,970 --> 01:34:46,159
Open the door!

1236
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:01,130
Asuna!

1237
01:35:05,890 --> 01:35:08,040
Asuna! You okay?

1238
01:35:09,981 --> 01:35:11,179
Kirito!

1239
01:35:12,499 --> 01:35:16,017
Damn it. Looks like Kirito will have
to handle things on his own in there.

1240
01:35:16,495 --> 01:35:17,519
Come on!

1241
01:35:23,208 --> 01:35:24,194
Yuuna?

1242
01:35:24,656 --> 01:35:27,610
Please, Dad. You have to stop this now.

1243
01:35:27,896 --> 01:35:30,319
No. You're not quite ready yet.

1244
01:35:30,496 --> 01:35:33,544
But I don't want to come back to life.

1245
01:35:33,616 --> 01:35:34,714
Of course you don't.

1246
01:35:34,929 --> 01:35:38,740
You're still an AI and that's what your
self‐preservation program is making you say.

1247
01:35:39,322 --> 01:35:42,563
It won't be long now, so just be a good girl and wait.

1248
01:35:42,744 --> 01:35:44,190
But, Dad...

1249
01:35:44,381 --> 01:35:47,519
The AI crawler is collecting
all the data from the players.

1250
01:35:48,035 --> 01:35:49,362
She's almost done.

1251
01:35:49,897 --> 01:35:53,755
It's her final task. She did a fine job.

1252
01:35:53,878 --> 01:35:55,391
You have to stop this!

1253
01:35:55,448 --> 01:35:57,802
If you run a high‐output scan inside there,

1254
01:35:57,843 --> 01:36:00,945
those people might not just lose
their memories, they could die!

1255
01:36:00,970 --> 01:36:02,439
That is enough, Yuuna!

1256
01:36:19,188 --> 01:36:21,769
I would happily sell my soul to the devil,

1257
01:36:21,850 --> 01:36:24,415
if it meant I could bring you back to life.

1258
01:36:24,895 --> 01:36:29,281
I swear I'd... do anything,

1259
01:36:29,373 --> 01:36:31,837
even if it meant I ended up like Kayaba.

1260
01:36:31,995 --> 01:36:34,910
All I want is to get you back in my life.

1261
01:36:48,589 --> 01:36:49,549
Step back!

1262
01:36:58,548 --> 01:37:00,597
He's not making it easy for us.

1263
01:37:01,217 --> 01:37:04,014
That camera's recording. Find out where it's connected.

1264
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:10,177
That should keep you busy for a while, Kikuoka.

1265
01:37:14,764 --> 01:37:17,924
I'm sorry, sir. I lost to one of the players.

1266
01:37:18,063 --> 01:37:20,819
But you can go ahead with the brain scan on the crowd.

1267
01:37:20,857 --> 01:37:24,767
I can't wait to see Yuuna again. The way she was.

1268
01:37:24,837 --> 01:37:27,562
You still have one last task to finish, though.

1269
01:37:27,815 --> 01:37:28,516
What?

1270
01:37:28,707 --> 01:37:31,742
You have to give me your memories of Yuuna as well.

1271
01:37:31,823 --> 01:37:32,409
Huh?

1272
01:37:32,599 --> 01:37:34,579
Of all the players in SAO,

1273
01:37:34,604 --> 01:37:37,167
you were the one who spent the most time with her.

1274
01:37:37,318 --> 01:37:38,773
What did you expect?

1275
01:37:39,687 --> 01:37:43,364
Besides, if you can't even
master the equipment I gave you,

1276
01:37:43,396 --> 01:37:44,477
what use are you?

1277
01:37:44,598 --> 01:37:46,838
What? But what about our deal?

1278
01:37:46,973 --> 01:37:49,872
You said you'd make it,
so I could be with Yuuna forever!

1279
01:37:50,151 --> 01:37:51,278
Farewell.

1280
01:38:09,799 --> 01:38:10,498
Yuuna!

1281
01:38:10,523 --> 01:38:11,959
Help me, Kirito!

1282
01:38:12,031 --> 01:38:14,977
If we don't stop this, everyone here is going to die!

1283
01:38:15,272 --> 01:38:18,569
Once the average of their emotive counters passes 10,000,

1284
01:38:18,594 --> 01:38:21,738
a high output scan will activate and destroy their brains!

1285
01:38:22,277 --> 01:38:23,015
I'm on it!

1286
01:38:23,367 --> 01:38:26,346
Everyone! Take off your Augmas! Now!

1287
01:38:26,371 --> 01:38:28,507
Take them off, or you'll die!

1288
01:38:29,636 --> 01:38:30,774
It's no use.

1289
01:38:30,816 --> 01:38:35,701
My dad put the bosses in the other events, so everyone
here would fight, thinking it's part of the game!

1290
01:38:36,006 --> 01:38:37,422
What am I supposed to do?

1291
01:38:37,447 --> 01:38:39,265
Go to the place we met yesterday.

1292
01:38:39,332 --> 01:38:41,687
That was Floor 100 in Old Aincrad!

1293
01:38:41,806 --> 01:38:43,340
Go there and beat the boss!

1294
01:38:44,475 --> 01:38:47,303
It's our last hope. Sit down.

1295
01:38:47,328 --> 01:38:50,356
I'm going to unlock the Augma's FullDive function now.

1296
01:38:50,381 --> 01:38:52,390
You can FullDive with the Augma?

1297
01:38:52,415 --> 01:38:57,011
The Augma's just a version of the NerveGear
with limited functions. Now get going!

1298
01:38:59,571 --> 01:39:00,493
I'm ready!

1299
01:39:01,875 --> 01:39:02,822
You guys...

1300
01:39:07,048 --> 01:39:07,755
Let's do this.

1301
01:39:07,794 --> 01:39:08,140
Yeah!

1302
01:39:08,182 --> 01:39:09,509
Good luck, Daddy!

1303
01:39:09,729 --> 01:39:11,197
Yui. Guard your mom.

1304
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:11,951
Right!

1305
01:39:12,571 --> 01:39:13,286
Kirito!

1306
01:39:13,311 --> 01:39:15,137
Don't worry, this won't take long.

1307
01:39:15,423 --> 01:39:17,186
We're the only chance these people have

1308
01:39:17,345 --> 01:39:19,203
but I'm gonna need you to wait here.

1309
01:39:22,041 --> 01:39:22,942
Kirito...

1310
01:39:23,333 --> 01:39:25,568
Keep that safe, till I get back, okay?

1311
01:39:30,094 --> 01:39:31,388
Link start!

1312
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:40,401
No way!

1313
01:39:40,736 --> 01:39:44,047
So this is Floor 100, The Ruby Palace!

1314
01:39:44,111 --> 01:39:47,726
Can't believe after two years,
we finally get to take a crack at it!

1315
01:40:00,676 --> 01:40:01,553
Agil!

1316
01:40:05,517 --> 01:40:08,605
So you're the last boss of SAO , huh?

1317
01:40:09,597 --> 01:40:10,576
Let's go!

1318
01:40:33,714 --> 01:40:34,674
Switch out!

1319
01:40:36,195 --> 01:40:37,081
Switch!

1320
01:40:54,586 --> 01:40:55,605
Shit.

1321
01:40:55,731 --> 01:40:57,108
No way.

1322
01:40:57,264 --> 01:40:59,760
Oh, man. How do we beat that thing?

1323
01:41:18,504 --> 01:41:20,219
I'm sorry, Asuna.

1324
01:41:20,505 --> 01:41:22,879
I'm the reason your memory was stolen.

1325
01:41:22,993 --> 01:41:28,209
My father's collecting the other SAO players'
memories of me from when I was alive in Aincrad.

1326
01:41:28,839 --> 01:41:33,780
He's using the old bosses to force the survivors
here to remember their fear of dying in SAO.

1327
01:41:33,968 --> 01:41:37,203
Then he'll run a scan on their
brains to extract the memories.

1328
01:41:38,293 --> 01:41:42,471
If that happens, it might end up
damaging everyone's brains permanently.

1329
01:41:42,496 --> 01:41:44,012
It might even kill them!

1330
01:41:44,337 --> 01:41:45,696
Oh, my God!

1331
01:41:47,431 --> 01:41:48,610
No, don't!

1332
01:41:50,203 --> 01:41:52,744
If I take it off his head, he'll be saved.

1333
01:41:52,769 --> 01:41:54,880
But then, what about the other players?

1334
01:41:55,079 --> 01:41:56,644
They're still in danger.

1335
01:42:06,846 --> 01:42:12,162
Yuuna, you died in SAO, because you were
brave enough to leave the safe zone.

1336
01:42:13,291 --> 01:42:16,427
You fought a boss and tried to clear a floor, didn't you?

1337
01:42:17,015 --> 01:42:19,010
I can't sit here and do nothing.

1338
01:42:19,582 --> 01:42:22,221
Yui? I'm going to help Kirito and the others.

1339
01:42:22,284 --> 01:42:24,754
Okay, Mommy. I'll join you in a little bit.

1340
01:42:29,083 --> 01:42:30,466
Link start!

1341
01:42:32,628 --> 01:42:34,455
Oh, no!

1342
01:42:37,148 --> 01:42:38,173
Silica!

1343
01:42:40,899 --> 01:42:41,725
Kirito!

1344
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:42,669
Silica!

1345
01:42:45,109 --> 01:42:46,459
No!

1346
01:42:47,454 --> 01:42:48,331
Crap!

1347
01:43:01,991 --> 01:43:02,706
Asuna!

1348
01:43:02,731 --> 01:43:03,710
I got you!

1349
01:43:04,154 --> 01:43:07,035
It's my fault! You lost your memories because of me!

1350
01:43:07,062 --> 01:43:10,723
No, stop blaming yourself. It's okay now.

1351
01:43:13,043 --> 01:43:14,137
Asuna!

1352
01:43:18,868 --> 01:43:20,734
Hi, guys. Sorry I'm late.

1353
01:43:21,067 --> 01:43:22,498
You okay to be here?

1354
01:43:23,355 --> 01:43:27,002
Mm‐hm. I'm ready to fight. I'm not afraid anymore.

1355
01:43:27,613 --> 01:43:28,194
Good.

1356
01:43:44,443 --> 01:43:46,906
Kazuto! Sorry I'm late!

1357
01:43:48,374 --> 01:43:51,092
Daddy, Mommy! I brought everyone else, too!

1358
01:43:53,945 --> 01:43:55,518
This is gonna be fun!

1359
01:43:55,543 --> 01:43:56,512
Stay sharp, general!

1360
01:43:56,988 --> 01:43:59,340
Ha! We rule in VR!

1361
01:44:01,525 --> 01:44:03,188
Skeena Guail!
Guy‐sah Oru‐muru!

1362
01:44:07,698 --> 01:44:09,277
She's a big lady!

1363
01:44:09,388 --> 01:44:10,398
They're here, too?

1364
01:44:10,423 --> 01:44:11,019
Yay!

1365
01:44:11,217 --> 01:44:12,393
Time's running out!

1366
01:44:12,472 --> 01:44:13,411
Hit it again!

1367
01:44:13,436 --> 01:44:16,381
Don't just stand there! You've got work to do!

1368
01:44:24,636 --> 01:44:25,604
What the...?

1369
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:27,011
Pina!

1370
01:44:29,062 --> 01:44:31,843
I loaded up your saved data from the SAO server.

1371
01:44:32,145 --> 01:44:34,292
I thought you'd be more comfortable this way.

1372
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:36,213
I also brought your gear, Sinon!

1373
01:44:40,455 --> 01:44:42,346
All right! Let's do this!

1374
01:44:42,537 --> 01:44:43,426
Yeah!

1375
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:22,778
Hurry! Block it!

1376
01:45:25,836 --> 01:45:27,042
You and me, Asuna!

1377
01:45:27,067 --> 01:45:27,528
Right!

1378
01:45:32,882 --> 01:45:33,610
Damn it!

1379
01:45:38,578 --> 01:45:39,253
Switch!

1380
01:45:39,477 --> 01:45:41,098
I know what skill to use.

1381
01:46:34,751 --> 01:46:37,496
Now you really have cleared the game, Kirito.

1382
01:46:37,539 --> 01:46:38,428
Kayaba?

1383
01:46:39,167 --> 01:46:41,780
You only have one thing left to do.

1384
01:47:45,539 --> 01:47:46,457
It's Yuna!

1385
01:48:02,869 --> 01:48:05,226
Why is this happening?

1386
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:09,102
I was so close, Yuuna! So close!

1387
01:48:16,670 --> 01:48:17,948
Don't worry, Dad.

1388
01:48:18,408 --> 01:48:21,198
No matter what, I'll always be in your memories.

1389
01:48:21,493 --> 01:48:22,830
Forever and ever.

1390
01:49:04,872 --> 01:49:07,073
You sounded great up there, Yuuna.

1391
01:49:07,279 --> 01:49:08,251
Thanks a lot.

1392
01:49:11,076 --> 01:49:13,213
The data for my primary body

1393
01:49:13,238 --> 01:49:16,685
was based on the resource script
of the boss from Floor 100.

1394
01:49:16,941 --> 01:49:20,172
Its language engine is what allowed me to move around.

1395
01:49:20,197 --> 01:49:24,098
But the boss was defeated and its
saved data will be initialized.

1396
01:49:24,336 --> 01:49:26,459
So now I have to say goodbye to you.

1397
01:49:26,484 --> 01:49:27,325
No way.

1398
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:28,889
It's not a bad thing.

1399
01:49:29,399 --> 01:49:35,093
I got to sing in front of a huge audience,
so my wish was fulfilled. I couldn't be happier.

1400
01:49:35,593 --> 01:49:38,146
Before I go, I have to give this back to you.

1401
01:49:38,979 --> 01:49:41,991
Your fear of death is what
caused you to lose your memories.

1402
01:49:42,284 --> 01:49:44,587
But you overcame it and fought anyway.

1403
01:49:45,217 --> 01:49:47,621
I'm sure everything will come back to you now.

1404
01:50:02,934 --> 01:50:06,380
You remembered my wish, Eiji. Thank you.

1405
01:50:46,837 --> 01:50:49,668
The AR idol, Yuna, is making headlines again.

1406
01:50:49,825 --> 01:50:55,099
During her concert at the New National Stadium,
several boss monsters from Ordinal Scale appeared.

1407
01:50:55,258 --> 01:50:59,294
The promoters of the show said today
that it was a surprise event for the fans.

1408
01:50:59,897 --> 01:51:01,115
In other game‐related news,

1409
01:51:01,140 --> 01:51:03,847
Kamura Incorporated, the company behind the Augma,

1410
01:51:03,872 --> 01:51:05,778
revealed that their head of development,

1411
01:51:05,803 --> 01:51:09,963
Dr. Shigemura of Toto Institute, has decided to step down.

1412
01:51:14,279 --> 01:51:16,221
Bet you're glad to be out of that hospital.

1413
01:51:16,262 --> 01:51:17,561
Yeah, how's your arm doing?

1414
01:51:17,586 --> 01:51:19,953
Ow! Nah, I'm kidding, it's fine.

1415
01:51:19,978 --> 01:51:22,659
But I'll be sticking to VR games from now on.

1416
01:51:22,684 --> 01:51:25,027
But you got to meet more girls in AR.

1417
01:51:25,052 --> 01:51:29,174
Eh, it's no big deal. Nobody meets
their dream girl in games, anyway.

1418
01:51:29,399 --> 01:51:31,750
You better pray my wife never hears you say that.

1419
01:51:32,011 --> 01:51:34,932
Yo, she gave up her ticket for your broke ass.

1420
01:51:34,967 --> 01:51:36,134
Ow! What's your problem?

1421
01:51:36,159 --> 01:51:36,866
Apologize!

1422
01:51:36,905 --> 01:51:39,708
Um, guys, I brought something back for everyone.

1423
01:51:39,914 --> 01:51:41,899
Where was this boot camp you went to?

1424
01:51:41,924 --> 01:51:42,836
Shimane.

1425
01:51:42,935 --> 01:51:44,929
The place we stayed didn't have computers.

1426
01:51:44,954 --> 01:51:48,303
If I didn't smuggle in my Amusphere,
I would've died from boredom!

1427
01:51:48,653 --> 01:51:49,661
Eh...

1428
01:51:49,867 --> 01:51:52,259
By the way, where's Kirito and Asuna?

1429
01:51:52,501 --> 01:51:54,422
They said they had other plans tonight.

1430
01:51:54,463 --> 01:51:55,592
Anyone know what they're doing?

1431
01:51:55,633 --> 01:51:57,637
Oh, who cares about them.

1432
01:51:57,758 --> 01:51:59,432
If they're not here, they're missing out.

1433
01:51:59,473 --> 01:52:00,786
Some friend.

1434
01:52:00,967 --> 01:52:04,223
I get discharged and he can't come by for a drink?

1435
01:52:04,296 --> 01:52:05,193
He can suck it.

1436
01:52:05,354 --> 01:52:07,990
On second thought, you can buy your own drinks tonight.

1437
01:52:08,078 --> 01:52:09,516
You all owe me for that ticket.

1438
01:52:09,555 --> 01:52:13,084
You greedy... You got that ticket for
free, you cardboard‐sword dealer!

1439
01:52:13,289 --> 01:52:14,767
Oh, whatever.

1440
01:52:15,125 --> 01:52:19,323
At least I got ALO. Now that it's hopping
again, maybe I'll meet some new hotties.

1441
01:52:19,827 --> 01:52:20,615
Nope.

1442
01:52:23,502 --> 01:52:25,752
You were right, it gets dark up here.

1443
01:52:25,884 --> 01:52:27,822
Yeah. Can you see, Yui?

1444
01:52:27,864 --> 01:52:30,284
Yup! I can see just fine, Daddy!

1445
01:52:30,787 --> 01:52:33,542
The color balance is skewing a little green, though.

1446
01:52:35,130 --> 01:52:37,689
For a while there,
I didn't think we'd get to come here.

1447
01:52:37,801 --> 01:52:40,222
Oh, and in the end, I left without telling my mom.

1448
01:52:40,264 --> 01:52:41,100
You what?

1449
01:52:41,852 --> 01:52:43,314
You're kidding, right?

1450
01:52:48,405 --> 01:52:50,290
I'll talk to her when we get back.

1451
01:52:54,796 --> 01:52:58,474
Do you remember what we promised
each other back in Aincrad now?

1452
01:52:58,759 --> 01:53:00,642
What, to go stargazing?

1453
01:53:00,763 --> 01:53:03,476
Well, yeah. That was part of it.

1454
01:53:03,575 --> 01:53:05,815
I'm kidding. I remember.

1455
01:53:05,966 --> 01:53:08,863
You said if we ever got out, you'd give me a real ring.

1456
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:12,924
Here. For you!

1457
01:53:12,949 --> 01:53:13,539
Um.

1458
01:53:13,581 --> 01:53:17,356
It's not fair if you're the only one
handing out presents, so I got you one.

1459
01:53:17,929 --> 01:53:18,799
Thank you.

1460
01:53:24,274 --> 01:53:27,944
This time, put it on my finger. And this time, for real.

1461
01:53:43,056 --> 01:53:44,677
Look! A shooting star!

1462
01:53:49,459 --> 01:53:50,348
Wow!

1463
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:51,380
Amazing!

1464
01:59:17,265 --> 01:59:19,471
Why all the mystery, Kikuoka?

1465
01:59:19,645 --> 01:59:21,733
What did you bring me down here for?

1466
01:59:21,876 --> 01:59:24,481
I appreciate you getting the charges against me dropped,

1467
01:59:24,567 --> 01:59:26,992
but it's time you told me what this is about.

1468
01:59:27,095 --> 01:59:30,131
Actually, doctor, I want to talk about the future.

1469
01:59:30,519 --> 01:59:32,934
I've been keeping a close eye on your research.

1470
01:59:33,164 --> 01:59:37,073
And now, I feel like I've seen
how far a top‐down AI can go.

1471
01:59:37,708 --> 01:59:40,720
But I have my sights on a different kind of future.

1472
01:59:41,609 --> 01:59:43,993
You're the head of the Shigemura Research Lab.

1473
01:59:44,303 --> 01:59:47,975
Your students included Akihiko Kayaba and Nobuyuki Sugou.

1474
01:59:48,276 --> 01:59:51,653
So I know what I'm about to show you will interest you.

1475
01:59:54,298 --> 01:59:56,848
Kikuoka, what is that?

1476
01:59:58,654 --> 02:00:00,677
Welcome to Rath.
