1
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:55,208
Early 21st century: worldwide,
the robotics industry undergoes

2
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,500
a period of rapid advancement.

3
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:00,875
By the year 2050, Japan
has firmly established itself

4
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:04,458
as the leader in robotic
technology and manufacture.

5
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:07,791
From consumer electronics
to military-grade weaponry,

6
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,500
Japan dominates the market.

7
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:13,541
As the technology evolves to
include robotic enhancements

8
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,458
to the human body, the blurring
of the line between man

9
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:20,041
and machine triggers a sudden
shift in world opinion.

10
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,666
The potential for creation
of human-like androids

11
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,708
is seen as a threat.

12
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:28,666
In response, the U.N. passes
an accord strictly prohibiting

13
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,333
android development.

14
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:33,375
Japan fiercely opposes the
U.N. ruling, but despite

15
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:37,375
repeated challenges, the
restrictions will not be eased.

16
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:41,041
In protest, Japan resorts to
the extreme step of withdrawing

17
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:44,458
from the U.N., choosing
instead to pursue a policy of

18
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:47,666
"high-tech national isolation".

19
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,833
2067: continued technological
advancements make Japan's

20
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:55,458
goal of total national
isolation a reality.

21
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:58,375
Japan's borders are sealed,
and strict controls are placed

22
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:01,041
on all international
communications.

23
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,625
The resulting
information blackout

24
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:05,916
shrouds the entire country
in a veil of secrecy.

25
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:10,166
In the ten years since that
time, no outsider has been

26
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:14,166
allowed to see the
true face of Japan...

27
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,291
All my holiday plans are ruined.

28
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,791
I take it your family has
already left Washington

29
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:55,708
ahead of you?

30
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,208
Back to Denver, is it?

31
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:00,208
Don't these damn Japanese
understand it's Christmas?

32
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,333
Dragging us all the way out
here--it's outrageous.

33
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,833
Even so...

34
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,333
do we have a choice?

35
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,416
Do you have any idea
what this is about?

36
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,833
Whatever it is,

37
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,875
this announcement of theirs
must be something big.

38
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,833
The British, the French,
Russians--

39
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,583
they've called everybody.

40
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:44,791
I heard that--

41
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:02,833
Vexille...

42
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,708
Vexille...!

43
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,625
Right, final stand-by...

44
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,458
We go live on my mark.

45
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,416
How'd we get stuck
with this shit today?

46
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,750
What, you got
somewhere better to be?

47
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,083
There'll be another
Christmas next year.

48
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,000
Go in, do your job,
and get out...

49
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,291
You'll be back in time
for Mom's turkey.

50
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,333
Now, gentlemen...

51
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:51,083
The future of human evolution...

52
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:55,125
That is the issue
before us this evening.

53
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,250
The international
scientific community

54
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,250
has reached a consensus...

55
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,708
Nature has run its course...

56
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:05,791
It is left to man to
determine his own fate.

57
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:06,875
As you know...

58
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,958
we at Daiwa have
a vision for the future.

59
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,208
If we have your full
support in this matter,

60
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,250
please,

61
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:16,333
show it now,
by round of applause.

62
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,500
I didn't think so...

63
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,333
Our target is Saito
with Daiwa Robotics.

64
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,333
We're working off a tip.

65
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:01,500
There's a chance it's a trap,
so everyone stay on your toes.

66
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:04,666
You're kidding.

67
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,916
What's with the robots...?

68
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,541
I made it clear
we didn't need mech support.

69
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:09,625
Don't ask me...

70
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,041
Guess the Chief wants us
to test 'em out.

71
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,166
Look like the
latest Daiwa models.

72
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,041
Yeah?

73
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,250
Well I still don't trust 'em.

74
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,458
I hate these damn machines.

75
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,666
S.W.O.R.D...?

76
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,000
Maria...

77
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:32,625
Move!

78
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:33,875
Out of the way!

79
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,666
Dammit!

80
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:08,416
Get...

81
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,000
rid of the bodies.

82
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,041
What's the meaning of this...!

83
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,375
Who gave the order
for S.W.O.R.D.

84
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,833
to attack?!

85
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:29,750
Answer me...!

86
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:30,583
You...!

87
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:31,750
Don't you know who I am...?!

88
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,791
You're all making
a terrible mistake!

89
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,833
I want names and serial
numbers of everyone here!

90
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:45,833
Leon!

91
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:12,541
Well, it's a flagrant violation
of international treaties...

92
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:13,916
Care to be more specific?

93
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,250
No need.

94
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:19,000
They ignored just about
every one I can think of.

95
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,708
So what, you mean this
whole thing's made of metal?

96
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:22,708
Essentially.

97
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,666
It's bio-metal.

98
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,541
Is there a chance his leg
was the only robotic part?

99
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,916
We can hope that's the case.

100
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,500
What do you mean?

101
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,916
It has to be.

102
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,791
We confirmed his bio-signature
during the raid, right?

103
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,500
We can't rule out the
possibility that it was

104
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,375
artificially imprinted.

105
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,750
Wait--is that possible?

106
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,125
Not with our technology, no.

107
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,833
So...

108
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:48,333
if Japan really is manufacturing
androids this far advanced...

109
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,583
Christ...

110
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,208
it's gotta be
a bigger threat than nukes.

111
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,958
So, what--you think
they're buildin' some kinda'

112
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,166
"android army"?

113
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,625
That's crazy!

114
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,166
In any case, issues
of legality aside...

115
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,083
it's an amazing
feat of technology.

116
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:06,500
I imagine it would take us
years to reverse-engineer it.

117
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,666
It's like San Pedro
all over again, huh?

118
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,333
Hey.

119
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,791
Zack!

120
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,166
Look out there.

121
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,875
Millions of people
livin' in this city

122
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,458
and you'd hardly know it.

123
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:53,500
Only ones we ever talk to are
the ones wearin' this badge...

124
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,333
Or to our damn
computers, right?

125
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,125
It's the same everywhere.

126
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,125
It's the age we live in.

127
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,291
You heard from Irene?

128
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,208
Not since she left.

129
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,916
Sorry.

130
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,791
So...

131
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,208
what's up?

132
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:19,083
Leon never told you about
San Pedro last month?

133
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,166
Really...

134
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,500
Is that where the tip for this
last mission came from...?

135
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,458
San Pedro?

136
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,125
Yeah...

137
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,125
I didn't think it was a secret.

138
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:32,166
Is there really a reason
for us to be on guard duty?

139
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,666
Over there...

140
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,000
New shipment of sentry robots.

141
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,250
What I mean is,
who's gonna steal 'em?

142
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,625
Japan's sellin' these
things to everybody.

143
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,250
They're the ones
controlling the market...

144
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,000
Yeah...

145
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,541
n' they know it, too.

146
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,083
Not shy about throwin' their
weight around, that's for sure.

147
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,791
It's gonna come back
and bite 'em some day.

148
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,666
Warning: Cease pursuit
and withdraw immediately.

149
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,958
You gotta be kidding.

150
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,333
I repeat: Cease
pursuit immediately.

151
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,125
This is your final warning.

152
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,083
This is our turf.

153
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,541
Fuck off.

154
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:16,625
Zack!

155
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:26,250
Hey, careful with this guy!

156
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,833
S.W.O.R.D...

157
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:32,583
Twenty-fourth, December...

158
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,750
Mount Filar...

159
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:35,916
A meeting...

160
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,458
Beware...

161
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,041
Ma...

162
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,291
ri-a...

163
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:57,291
It was like the message was
 meant specifically for Leon.

164
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,958
He didn't doubt it,
not even for a second.

165
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:02,375
But the best part is...

166
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:03,333
This fugitive...?

167
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:05,541
Guess what he turned out to be.

168
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:07,750
An android.

169
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:08,708
Yeah.

170
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:09,916
Though just lookin',

171
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,250
damned if you could
tell he wasn't human...

172
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,708
There any chance that he was?

173
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:13,916
No, none.

174
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,916
Not even a hint of
a bio-signature.

175
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,166
But those eyes...

176
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:22,208
What about the autopsy?

177
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:23,583
What autopsy...?

178
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,500
They bagged that android
and shipped it back to Japan

179
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:26,708
the very same day...

180
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:28,333
We couldn't even touch it.

181
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:30,750
"Political pressure"
they said...

182
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:33,083
Though personally I think
that's a load a' shit.

183
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:43,250
"Maria"...

184
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:46,625
For ten years, Japan has
operated below the radar.

185
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:48,833
In recent months, however,
we have observed a surge of

186
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:51,458
new activity, the
suspicious nature of which

187
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:53,750
we can no longer ignore.

188
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:56,166
The purpose of the secret
meeting on Mt. Filar is still

189
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,875
unknown.

190
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:59,958
By authority of the
State Department...

191
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,916
our primary witness...

192
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,041
the politician we apprehended...

193
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:06,291
was granted complete immunity.

194
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:09,125
In addition...

195
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,583
we've received strong
pressure from Japan...

196
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:14,458
for the return of
Saito's confiscated leg.

197
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:19,708
Our initial analysis has
yielded some troubling results.

198
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:21,041
We have determined the leg

199
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:23,833
to be of a pseudo-organic,
metallic composition...

200
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:25,291
There is also some evidence

201
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:28,875
to suggest the bio-signature
was affixed artificially.

202
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:30,500
Our conclusion...

203
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:33,250
there's a high probability
that Saito is an android.

204
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,875
As you know, android
development in disregard

205
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:41,208
of the U.N. accord is a
serious international crime.

206
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,541
But until further
evidence is obtained...

207
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:48,166
Our government feels...

208
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,541
discretion is of the
utmost importance.

209
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:53,625
From the White House...

210
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:55,125
the official stance...

211
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:57,625
Any action that may even
slightly harm relations

212
00:25:57,708 --> 00:25:59,750
with Japan is forbidden.

213
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:02,041
However,

214
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:04,791
the risks of doing nothing
are abundantly clear...

215
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:09,166
To maintain appearances...

216
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,833
As of now...

217
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:13,833
our actions are
considered independent.

218
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:16,791
In the event we are discovered,
the American government

219
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,291
will deny all prior knowledge.

220
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:23,166
Nevertheless...

221
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,625
it's for our nation's
security that we must act...

222
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:29,458
perhaps, for the security
of the entire world.

223
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:34,125
The mission before us:

224
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,916
Infiltrate Japan.

225
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:44,583
The time has come to lift the
veil of secrecy and expose

226
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:47,666
the true face of
Japan to the world...

227
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:50,541
I am counting on all
of you to do your part.

228
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,041
These are our most
recent images of Tokyo...

229
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:04,166
taken just over ten years ago.

230
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,166
Current conditions are unknown.

231
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,708
And all access to Japan
has been cut off.

232
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:11,291
What we know, at the time
these photos were taken,

233
00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:14,666
Japan's largest corporation,
Daiwa Robotics, was largely

234
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:18,291
in control of the country's
economy and national politics.

235
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:21,041
Our guess is, they were the
ones who began the initial push

236
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:23,708
toward the policy of
"high tech isolationism",

237
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:26,000
which was ultimately realized
through the construction of

238
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:30,000
an electromagnetic network,
known by the acronym, "R.A.C.E."

239
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,083
The R.A.C.E. network

240
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:33,000
is comprised of
two-hundred-and-seventy

241
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:35,750
dedicated, ocean-based
antennas that surround

242
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:37,708
the entire nation.

243
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:39,791
The signal pattern these
antennas produce serves to

244
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:42,833
filter all light and
electromagnetic waves

245
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:47,125
entering Japan, and completely
diffuses any outgoing signals.

246
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:49,750
This effectively makes
communication with Japan through

247
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:53,166
non-official channels, as well
as satellite surveillance,

248
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,750
impossible.

249
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:57,333
The primary objective of this
mission will be to penetrate the

250
00:27:57,416 --> 00:28:00,833
electromagnetic field, and
transmit a special trace signal

251
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:04,166
from inside to analyze
the diffusion pattern.

252
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,000
If successful, it will enable
our spy satellites to take

253
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:10,291
direct images of Japan from
their positions in orbit.

254
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:13,166
Upon arrival in Tokyo, the
insertion team will only need

255
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,708
to transmit the signal
for three minutes,

256
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:18,208
in order to supply us
with the data we need.

257
00:28:18,291 --> 00:28:20,708
The problem is
the route of entry.

258
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:22,833
In addition to R.A.C.E.,
a sensor wall,

259
00:28:22,916 --> 00:28:26,250
capable of detecting even the
latest micro-scouting devices,

260
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:29,708
guards all physical routes
of entry by water and air.

261
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:33,083
Our only potential access point:
a single, heavily secured

262
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:34,916
border gate, which
allows shipping traffic

263
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,166
into the country...

264
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:58,250
As stated...

265
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:01,041
our first priority will be
transmission of the signal.

266
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:02,583
Once successful...

267
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:05,000
we'll move on to our
secondary objective.

268
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:06,375
Simply put:...

269
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:09,458
gather as much intelligence
on Daiwa as possible.

270
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:11,875
Seventy-two hours
after insertion...

271
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,833
the team will be extracted
from a predetermined site.

272
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:36,750
Leading the team on
this dangerous mission...

273
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:38,791
Commander Leon Fayden...

274
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:41,666
has graciously volunteered.

275
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,958
Ten years ago, the Commander was
dispatched to Japan as part of

276
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:47,708
an anti-terrorist unit,
in cooperation with the

277
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:50,250
Bureau of Public Security.

278
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:52,250
He was one of the last
foreigners to remain after

279
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:55,333
the closure of the border,
until such time as they

280
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:57,833
commanded his deportation.

281
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:08,166
Why didn't you tell me?

282
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:10,041
I'm sorry.

283
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,708
I didn't want you to worry.

284
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:13,208
Not about volunteering--...

285
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:16,000
that you were in Japan!

286
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:17,500
I don't know.

287
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,458
I never really had a chance.

288
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:20,916
That's the only reason?

289
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:24,708
That's all.

290
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:41,250
I'm sorry.

291
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:43,791
I didn't mean for you
to get involved...

292
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:10,333
What happened?

293
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:11,833
Bring up the deck monitor!

294
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:14,958
The vessel is not under attack.

295
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:16,833
Zero damage to report...

296
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:19,875
There's been an explosion on an
American freighter nearby...

297
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:21,791
We're looking into
the cause now.

298
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:22,791
Understood...

299
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:24,750
Stay alert, just in case.

300
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:16,333
Freight inspections
completed, sir.

301
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:17,916
All clear.

302
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:31,791
They've cleared
the border gate.

303
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:34,375
Ten seconds to
communications blackout.

304
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:41,291
Three minutes to
analysis completion.

305
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:43,666
Three minutes to
analysis completion.

306
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,500
Signal received...

307
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,166
Scanning now.

308
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:50,791
Okay...

309
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:52,166
Three minutes.

310
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,125
Analysis in progress...

311
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:57,375
Analysis in progress...

312
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:01,125
One minute down.

313
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Two minutes, thirty seconds.

314
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:20,166
Analysis complete in 10 seconds.

315
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,125
9...

316
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:22,125
8...

317
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:23,291
7...

318
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:25,958
What happened?!

319
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:26,625
The signal...

320
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:27,416
We've lost it!

321
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,583
What about the analysis?

322
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:29,250
No good...

323
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:30,541
Insufficient data!

324
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:31,791
Scan again!

325
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:41,458
System Alert...

326
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:44,583
System Alert...

327
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:47,541
System Alert...

328
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:50,625
System Alert...

329
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:54,000
System Alert...

330
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,333
Vexille, this way!

331
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:41,666
Zack!

332
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:19,041
I congratulate your effort.

333
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:21,500
You're the first foreign
visitors to set foot

334
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:25,416
on Japanese soil in ten years.

335
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,875
We have a warm welcome
planned for you.

336
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,541
On my mark...

337
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,791
make a break for the water.

338
00:37:34,875 --> 00:37:35,625
No way.

339
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:36,416
I'm not leaving you behind!

340
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,666
Dammit...

341
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,958
You've got the back-up
transmitter, you'll go!

342
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:42,291
Don't worry.

343
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:44,375
We'll be right behind you.

344
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:52,750
Leon...

345
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:05,166
It's okay, miss.

346
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,625
It's just me...

347
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:09,166
You're safe here.

348
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,041
No one's going to hurt you.

349
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:15,625
Oh--don't worry...

350
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:18,208
Maria changed
your clothes, not me.

351
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:19,750
Maria...?

352
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:25,791
No, don't go out there!

353
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:25,000
Keep quiet and
do exactly as I say.

354
00:40:34,208 --> 00:40:35,375
Maria!

355
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,958
You shouldn't go
wandering around...

356
00:40:40,041 --> 00:40:42,041
They're still combing
the city, looking for you.

357
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:43,791
I'm sorry, Maria...

358
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:45,708
It was my fault.

359
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:50,000
To think S.W.O.R.D.

360
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:51,541
would come here...

361
00:40:58,208 --> 00:40:59,791
You got so much...

362
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:03,958
The rest of my team?

363
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:07,250
Put this in cold water.

364
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:09,416
Yeah, sure.

365
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,333
Where are Leon and the others?

366
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:14,791
Leon Fayden.

367
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:16,416
What happened to him?!

368
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:20,666
There's been no word
about your colleagues.

369
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:27,958
We're still looking.

370
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:48,166
This is the real thing...

371
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,583
We don't get that
too often around here.

372
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:15,916
You were asleep for two days...

373
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,750
You should probably
eat something.

374
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:29,625
Are you the one that sent
the messenger to America...?

375
00:42:29,708 --> 00:42:31,625
About the meeting?

376
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,791
One more thing...

377
00:42:41,875 --> 00:42:43,708
Where are we?

378
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:49,083
Downtown Tokyo...

379
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,375
What's left of it, anyway.

380
00:42:55,583 --> 00:42:57,541
Tokyo...

381
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:10,625
Captain...!

382
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:11,750
We're picking up
a second transmission!

383
00:43:11,833 --> 00:43:13,875
...minutes to
analysis completion.

384
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:14,750
Three minutes to...

385
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:15,666
Is it from our people?

386
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:16,708
Affirmative...

387
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:18,250
the back-up transmitter.

388
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:20,291
The signal's coming
in strong, sir.

389
00:43:21,416 --> 00:43:22,333
Good...

390
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:24,083
Let's hope it
stays that way...

391
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:34,958
Never used chopsticks
before, huh, miss?

392
00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:42,166
That's cheating.

393
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:57,291
Wow...

394
00:43:57,375 --> 00:43:59,083
That's pretty neat...

395
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:01,416
Hey--where were
you hiding that?

396
00:44:12,875 --> 00:44:13,500
It's Saito.

397
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:15,000
He's on his way here.

398
00:44:38,833 --> 00:44:39,833
Nice entrance...

399
00:44:39,916 --> 00:44:41,291
Scary.

400
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,083
Whoops...

401
00:44:50,166 --> 00:44:51,333
I take that back...

402
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:55,500
Sending five guys out
for one little girl...?

403
00:44:55,583 --> 00:44:56,125
Please...

404
00:44:56,208 --> 00:44:57,791
That's just weak.

405
00:44:59,708 --> 00:45:00,666
The S.W.O.R.D. woman...

406
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:02,500
Where is she?

407
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:10,958
Guess she's not
under the table...

408
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,833
Wanna check the couch next?

409
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:16,458
The boss may choose
to go easy on you...

410
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:21,500
Don't expect that from me.

411
00:45:23,125 --> 00:45:25,208
I don't know what you and
your little urchin friends

412
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:28,250
are planning,
but whatever it is...

413
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:30,958
It's only a matter of time...

414
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,750
I'll be seeing you soon.

415
00:45:53,958 --> 00:45:55,291
You're right...

416
00:45:58,166 --> 00:46:00,083
It's only a matter of time.

417
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:32,416
They look serious today...

418
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,125
Bastards...

419
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,375
What is it?

420
00:46:45,666 --> 00:46:46,375
Just this...

421
00:46:46,458 --> 00:46:48,166
place...

422
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:53,083
Two for one!

423
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:54,958
Two for one!

424
00:46:55,041 --> 00:46:57,625
I've never seen
anything like it before...

425
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:02,083
I mean...

426
00:47:02,166 --> 00:47:04,000
It's so full of life...

427
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:04,125
Shit.

428
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:57,750
Hey...!

429
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:59,125
This way!

430
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:02,750
Down here!

431
00:49:11,291 --> 00:49:12,625
Analysis completion...

432
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:14,500
Captain...

433
00:49:14,583 --> 00:49:15,416
Countdown complete.

434
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,625
We have it, sir.

435
00:49:16,708 --> 00:49:17,375
Right...

436
00:49:17,458 --> 00:49:19,125
You all know what to do.

437
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,791
Screens one and two:

438
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:28,250
I want visual from
satellites JC17 and JD15.

439
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:30,291
Analysis program...

440
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:31,541
Initiated.

441
00:49:33,166 --> 00:49:34,750
Analysis is in progress.

442
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:37,541
Analysis is in progress.

443
00:49:52,791 --> 00:49:54,291
There's nothing there...

444
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,250
No mountains...

445
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:59,583
No rivers...

446
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:01,833
Cities...

447
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,916
What does it
look like in Tokyo?

448
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,208
Show me!

449
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,083
That's it...?

450
00:50:19,166 --> 00:50:21,125
That's all there is...?

451
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:30,333
Daiwa Robotics.

452
00:50:30,416 --> 00:50:31,416
Sir...!

453
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,333
Lt. Commander Serra's
bio-signature...

454
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:34,875
I've got her--she's in Tokyo!

455
00:50:34,958 --> 00:50:35,625
What...?

456
00:50:35,708 --> 00:50:36,916
Can we check her status?

457
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,041
Yes sir!

458
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:39,500
Satellites locking
on to her position.

459
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:41,083
Stand by for visual.

460
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:42,541
Any other survivors?

461
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:44,166
None yet confirmed.

462
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,041
Captain, you need to see this.

463
00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:47,833
Screen three.

464
00:50:47,916 --> 00:50:50,083
The red point is
Lt. Commander Serra...

465
00:50:50,166 --> 00:50:51,666
She's being pursued?

466
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,250
JD14 is tracking
her movements.

467
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:54,958
Captain--

468
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:56,125
What is it?

469
00:50:56,208 --> 00:50:58,208
The bio-signature map, it--...

470
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:01,250
it's unfiltered, sir...

471
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:05,500
We're not reading any
other bio-signatures...

472
00:51:05,583 --> 00:51:08,083
Hers is the only one!

473
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:09,916
The only one...?

474
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:18,000
What in the hell is going on...?

475
00:51:19,583 --> 00:51:20,750
Widen the scan.

476
00:51:20,833 --> 00:51:22,791
Search the entire country!

477
00:51:40,208 --> 00:51:41,458
Maria!

478
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:19,500
Oh my god...

479
00:52:30,166 --> 00:52:31,708
We'll wait here
for a few minutes,

480
00:52:31,791 --> 00:52:33,875
make sure we're
not being followed.

481
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:09,916
Some view, huh...?

482
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,958
They say everything outside
the city's a wasteland.

483
00:53:13,041 --> 00:53:16,041
Besides us, the only thing left
is Daiwa's headquarters...

484
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:17,708
Out in the bay.

485
00:53:17,791 --> 00:53:18,250
Here!

486
00:53:18,333 --> 00:53:19,333
I'll show you.

487
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:21,083
See?

488
00:53:21,166 --> 00:53:21,750
That island out there.

489
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:23,083
That's Daiwa.

490
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:31,833
They're the ones
that did this...

491
00:53:31,916 --> 00:53:34,416
It's their fault all
the people are gone.

492
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:39,750
The Japanese race is
all but extinct now...

493
00:53:39,833 --> 00:53:42,375
But, you...

494
00:53:42,458 --> 00:53:44,375
We're not really human.

495
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:46,625
Not anymore.

496
00:53:46,708 --> 00:53:48,250
Not human...?

497
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:50,958
You could say that we're...

498
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:53,208
more like fragments of humanity.

499
00:53:59,708 --> 00:54:01,625
Fragments...?

500
00:54:02,625 --> 00:54:04,000
That's all we have.

501
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:06,500
And, pretty soon
they'll be gone too.

502
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:09,416
You saw it...

503
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,583
the final change...

504
00:54:10,666 --> 00:54:12,708
when the last
traces disappear.

505
00:54:22,583 --> 00:54:25,625
As it is, we're
mostly machine now.

506
00:54:25,708 --> 00:54:28,333
There's no red blood
left in our veins.

507
00:54:40,166 --> 00:54:41,500
So all those
people down there...

508
00:54:41,583 --> 00:54:44,125
none of them are human...?

509
00:54:45,291 --> 00:54:48,041
But I don't think I've ever
seen a place more alive.

510
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,750
They're all just trying to make
the most of it while they can.

511
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:57,041
Like the way we
still eat food...

512
00:54:57,125 --> 00:54:59,333
even though we don't need to.

513
00:55:04,208 --> 00:55:06,958
It was ten years ago, just
after the government instituted

514
00:55:07,041 --> 00:55:09,375
the whole isolation policy.

515
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,041
We began hearing reports
of a mass epidemic...

516
00:55:13,125 --> 00:55:15,541
Some unknown disease
sweeping the country...

517
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:18,541
The details were
vague at first.

518
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:21,625
Nothing on the cause, or
transmission of the disease.

519
00:55:21,708 --> 00:55:23,750
Only that it was
highly contagious,

520
00:55:23,833 --> 00:55:26,875
and in most cases, fatal.

521
00:55:26,958 --> 00:55:29,500
Before the general public
even had time to react,

522
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:31,625
the government declared a
state of emergency and ordered

523
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:34,041
a mandatory vaccination program.

524
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:37,000
"For our protection",
they said...

525
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,708
As it turns out...

526
00:55:38,791 --> 00:55:41,666
that was the beginning
of our nightmare.

527
00:55:43,166 --> 00:55:46,166
The disease was a complete
government fabrication...

528
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:49,625
And the supposed "vaccine" they
were injecting into everyone...

529
00:55:49,708 --> 00:55:53,666
In reality, it was a
cyber-virus, developed by Daiwa.

530
00:55:57,041 --> 00:56:00,000
The virus has a mutating effect
on the cells of the body...

531
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:02,291
It alters their molecular
structure and converts them

532
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:04,083
into bio-metal...

533
00:56:04,166 --> 00:56:08,125
Essentially turning us into
machines from the inside out.

534
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,375
There's no way to stop it...

535
00:56:11,458 --> 00:56:12,875
And to make things worse...

536
00:56:12,958 --> 00:56:16,583
the cyber-virus was still
early in its experimental phase.

537
00:56:16,666 --> 00:56:18,208
What do you mean?

538
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:20,416
Daiwa didn't even know
if it would work.

539
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,708
It had never been
tested on a large scale.

540
00:56:22,791 --> 00:56:25,916
So they turned Japan into
their own private laboratory.

541
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,583
When it does work, the virus
gradually progresses through

542
00:56:30,666 --> 00:56:33,416
the body until it finally
reaches the brain...

543
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:37,625
At that point, we become perfect
androids under Daiwa's control.

544
00:56:39,666 --> 00:56:43,125
The speed of the process
differs from person to person.

545
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:46,041
Those of us who have yet
to be fully assimilated,

546
00:56:46,125 --> 00:56:50,125
as best we can, we hold on to
those fragments of our humanity

547
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:51,958
that still remain...

548
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,416
But even now,

549
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:57,666
we can feel them slipping
further and further away...

550
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:00,541
Since the technology was still
experimental, in the end

551
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:03,708
most of us will basically
be reduced to scrap metal.

552
00:57:03,791 --> 00:57:05,166
But it makes little difference.

553
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:07,041
At best, we're still
mindless machines,

554
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:09,291
with our memories erased.

555
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,125
So either way...

556
00:57:11,208 --> 00:57:14,166
we're all just
Daiwa's guinea pigs...

557
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:16,291
trapped and waiting to die.

558
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:21,875
Do you know how long you have?

559
00:57:21,958 --> 00:57:23,500
No...

560
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:24,875
What we do know is,

561
00:57:24,958 --> 00:57:28,083
Daiwa won't stop when
they're done with Japan...

562
00:57:28,166 --> 00:57:30,208
They'll target America next.

563
00:57:32,708 --> 00:57:35,833
They've already started planting
androids in key positions...

564
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:40,833
That politician...!

565
00:57:44,833 --> 00:57:46,583
Hey, that's Saga!

566
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:41,416
Go!

567
00:58:59,333 --> 00:59:01,375
We call those things "Jags"...

568
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:03,500
They're a side-effect
of the cyber-virus.

569
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:06,708
It's what happens when the
mechanization process goes bad.

570
00:59:06,791 --> 00:59:08,541
They pretty much try to
assimilate any kind of metal

571
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:09,875
they can find...

572
00:59:15,958 --> 00:59:16,708
Crazy, huh?

573
00:59:16,791 --> 00:59:18,500
The wasteland's full of 'em.

574
00:59:19,791 --> 00:59:21,125
But sometimes, if we're lucky,

575
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:23,208
they can throw up
some really cool stuff.

576
01:00:20,916 --> 01:00:22,458
We should get moving.

577
01:00:25,708 --> 01:00:26,625
Come on.

578
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:28,583
We have a secret
base underground.

579
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:49,708
I trust you've come bearing
news on the S.W.O.R.D. woman?

580
01:00:53,291 --> 01:00:55,500
She got away, sir.

581
01:00:55,583 --> 01:00:58,625
You mean like the informant
you let escape to America?

582
01:01:00,125 --> 01:01:02,958
We think Maria's
hiding her somewhere.

583
01:01:08,375 --> 01:01:09,916
Leave them.

584
01:01:11,583 --> 01:01:13,500
We also have reason
to believe S.W.O.R.D.

585
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:15,833
has penetrated
the R.A.C.E. net.

586
01:01:15,916 --> 01:01:17,333
No matter...

587
01:01:17,416 --> 01:01:20,833
By the time the Americans
act, it will be too late.

588
01:01:23,208 --> 01:01:25,583
Relax, Saito.

589
01:01:25,666 --> 01:01:30,083
Our decade-long experiment
is at last nearing completion.

590
01:01:30,166 --> 01:01:32,208
Group G-32 Beta in the slums

591
01:01:32,291 --> 01:01:35,125
is developing better
than we anticipated...

592
01:01:35,208 --> 01:01:37,833
They are perfect in every way.

593
01:01:41,666 --> 01:01:45,166
Maria and her cohorts are
a part of that group...

594
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:47,875
Left alone,
they will join us in time.

595
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:49,208
But sir...

596
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,458
What do we have to fear...?

597
01:01:52,541 --> 01:01:55,250
There's nothing anyone
can do to stop us.

598
01:02:06,875 --> 01:02:09,208
But just in case...

599
01:02:09,291 --> 01:02:12,125
Summon that "Chairman" Itakura.

600
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,708
Here.

601
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:43,875
Fresh piece of scrap for ya'...

602
01:02:43,958 --> 01:02:45,083
What do you think?

603
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:46,375
Can you get the parts
you need outta that?

604
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:47,041
Perfect.

605
01:02:47,125 --> 01:02:48,416
Thanks...

606
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,541
I'll make it work.

607
01:02:50,625 --> 01:02:52,166
Where's Maria?

608
01:02:54,291 --> 01:02:55,708
We've got a visitor...

609
01:02:56,708 --> 01:02:58,250
Vexille, from S.W.O.R.D.

610
01:03:17,791 --> 01:03:18,208
Taro...

611
01:03:18,291 --> 01:03:19,791
Is it ready?

612
01:03:19,875 --> 01:03:21,250
Ya' have'ta ask?

613
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:30,208
My suit!

614
01:03:30,291 --> 01:03:32,208
I got it all fixed up,
good as new...

615
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:34,583
Should be ready to go,
whenever you are.

616
01:03:40,708 --> 01:03:42,250
This what you're looking for?

617
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:48,416
I already sent the signal.

618
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:49,166
For how long?

619
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:50,250
Three minutes plus.

620
01:03:50,333 --> 01:03:51,916
So they took out
the R.A.C.E. net.

621
01:03:52,708 --> 01:03:54,041
All Daiwa had to do
was reconfigure

622
01:03:54,125 --> 01:03:55,583
the diffusion pattern.

623
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:56,875
Dammit!

624
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:58,041
It doesn't matter...

625
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:00,416
Only needed to be down
for a few minutes.

626
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,625
Should be enough
to get S.W.O.R.D. movin'.

627
01:04:03,458 --> 01:04:04,458
Oh...

628
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:05,833
another thing...

629
01:04:05,916 --> 01:04:07,958
They're holding one of your
teammates at Daiwa H.Q.

630
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:10,250
Leon?!

631
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:10,833
Yeah...

632
01:04:10,916 --> 01:04:11,375
That's right.

633
01:04:11,458 --> 01:04:12,791
Leon Fayden.

634
01:04:18,083 --> 01:04:19,500
What have they
done with him...?!

635
01:04:19,583 --> 01:04:20,083
Is he hurt?!

636
01:04:20,166 --> 01:04:20,833
Sorry...

637
01:04:20,916 --> 01:04:22,166
That's all I know.

638
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:23,125
Taro...

639
01:04:23,208 --> 01:04:24,083
What's your source?

640
01:04:24,166 --> 01:04:25,083
Daiwa mainstream.

641
01:04:25,166 --> 01:04:26,208
I pulled it myself...

642
01:04:26,291 --> 01:04:27,458
It's legit.

643
01:04:28,458 --> 01:04:29,791
It's just Leon...?

644
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:32,500
Yeah...

645
01:04:42,416 --> 01:04:43,708
Scan complete, sir...

646
01:04:43,791 --> 01:04:44,875
 It's come up empty...

647
01:04:44,958 --> 01:04:46,708
Not a single bio-signature.

648
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:49,333
Correction!

649
01:04:49,416 --> 01:04:52,666
I'm picking up one reading in
addition to Lt. Commander Serra!

650
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:54,125
It's faint, but...

651
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:56,041
Wait--there's something else...

652
01:05:01,208 --> 01:05:02,541
What's wrong?

653
01:05:02,625 --> 01:05:05,291
A shift in the electromagnetic
diffusion pattern, sir!

654
01:05:05,375 --> 01:05:06,166
Damn!

655
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:07,958
Attempting to re-analyze!

656
01:05:18,166 --> 01:05:19,416
That's it...

657
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:22,916
Prep Minerva to
retrieve any survivors.

658
01:05:24,375 --> 01:05:25,416
Captain Borg...

659
01:05:26,583 --> 01:05:28,125
A call on the hotline.

660
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:31,333
The secretary of defense?

661
01:05:31,416 --> 01:05:33,875
Tell him our
72-hours isn't up yet.

662
01:05:33,958 --> 01:05:35,500
It...

663
01:05:35,583 --> 01:05:37,375
It's the president, sir.

664
01:05:49,916 --> 01:05:51,666
Borg here.

665
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:54,250
Yes, Mr. President...

666
01:05:54,333 --> 01:05:55,875
That's correct...

667
01:05:55,958 --> 01:05:57,333
Seven agents.

668
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:01,750
Yes.

669
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,708
Understood, sir.

670
01:06:18,291 --> 01:06:20,791
It's over...

671
01:06:20,875 --> 01:06:23,000
Stand down.

672
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:58,458
Takashi.

673
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:00,416
Hey...

674
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,250
What's everyone
getting ready for?

675
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:04,166
There's gonna be an earthquake.

676
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:05,125
What?

677
01:07:05,208 --> 01:07:06,458
A quake...

678
01:07:06,541 --> 01:07:08,500
This is it, our last big chance.

679
01:07:09,583 --> 01:07:12,125
We're gonna go
smash up Daiwa...

680
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:14,416
Maria says I get
to help fight, too!

681
01:07:17,125 --> 01:07:18,250
Here's the deal.

682
01:07:18,333 --> 01:07:19,708
Daiwa's got these huge
freight tunnels that

683
01:07:19,791 --> 01:07:20,958
connect to the mainland...

684
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:22,041
Three of 'em.

685
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:27,208
The main line feeds
directly into the city.

686
01:07:27,291 --> 01:07:29,166
The other two open out
to the wasteland.

687
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:31,125
So these tunnels aren't metal.

688
01:07:31,208 --> 01:07:31,958
Ceramic?

689
01:07:32,041 --> 01:07:33,333
Right...

690
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:34,625
Now, there's a mid-scale
earthquake forecasted to hit

691
01:07:34,708 --> 01:07:37,000
sometime within the
next twenty-four hours...

692
01:07:37,083 --> 01:07:38,208
which means the couplings

693
01:07:38,291 --> 01:07:40,833
on these tunnels are
already being released.

694
01:07:40,916 --> 01:07:42,208
As a resistance measure.

695
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:43,375
Yep...

696
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:45,916
but turns out this
also exposes a weakness.

697
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,083
With the couplings released,

698
01:07:47,166 --> 01:07:48,583
the tunnel segments

699
01:07:48,666 --> 01:07:50,916
are switched over to independent
battery-powered operation.

700
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,958
And here's the key: so are
the five security-gates...

701
01:07:54,041 --> 01:07:55,333
There's an extended delay--

702
01:07:55,416 --> 01:07:57,875
about 1.5 times
longer than normal--

703
01:07:57,958 --> 01:08:00,041
between the time the
intruder alarm is tripped

704
01:08:00,125 --> 01:08:01,583
and gate activation.

705
01:08:01,666 --> 01:08:02,875
So what's our window...?

706
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:04,500
How long before total lockdown?

707
01:08:04,583 --> 01:08:05,208
Eighteen seconds.

708
01:08:05,291 --> 01:08:06,208
How far between gates?

709
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:07,583
About twenty-five
hundred meters.

710
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:09,250
Even at the fighter
suit's top speed...

711
01:08:09,333 --> 01:08:10,583
that's cutting it close.

712
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:12,791
Yeah, it's not much better
with our air buggies...

713
01:08:12,875 --> 01:08:14,375
But it's our only shot.

714
01:08:15,166 --> 01:08:16,833
And after you make it to Daiwa?

715
01:08:21,125 --> 01:08:22,750
If we make it through...

716
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:24,541
We'll be pulling this wire.

717
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:30,125
The Jags.

718
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:38,250
We get 'em to Daiwa's front
door, and they do the rest.

719
01:08:38,333 --> 01:08:40,416
We just need a few Jags
to take the bait...

720
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:41,875
Then we lead 'em
down the tunnel...

721
01:08:41,958 --> 01:08:43,583
and Daiwa's history.

722
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:45,791
Maria...!

723
01:08:45,875 --> 01:08:48,416
Chairman Itakura's called
an emergency council session.

724
01:09:02,791 --> 01:09:04,708
Is that all you have to say?

725
01:09:04,791 --> 01:09:07,250
It is.

726
01:09:07,333 --> 01:09:09,666
I thought we'd been
over all this before...

727
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:12,541
Those of you who choose to
sit back and wait for the end...

728
01:09:12,625 --> 01:09:14,458
We respect that decision.

729
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:20,333
But we both know what'll happen
if Daiwa reaches America...

730
01:09:20,416 --> 01:09:22,166
I choose to do something.

731
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:26,875
So...

732
01:09:26,958 --> 01:09:28,041
if there's nothing else...

733
01:09:28,125 --> 01:09:30,208
we're a little short on time.

734
01:09:33,541 --> 01:09:35,458
And if you fail...?

735
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:42,333
Think about what you're
doing--the repercussions...!

736
01:09:42,416 --> 01:09:45,625
Daiwa could open the gates to
the wasteland and wipe us out.

737
01:09:45,708 --> 01:09:48,375
What, and destroy their
"precious experiment"?

738
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:49,333
Now?

739
01:09:50,666 --> 01:09:52,833
I doubt they'd be
willing to do that.

740
01:09:58,708 --> 01:10:00,166
Listen...

741
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:03,708
In the end, we're all trying
to protect the same thing.

742
01:10:03,791 --> 01:10:06,041
It's Daiwa we
should be fighting.

743
01:10:09,333 --> 01:10:11,625
That's what we intend to do...

744
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:14,291
until the moment
we become scrap metal.

745
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:29,875
Chairman...?

746
01:10:29,958 --> 01:10:32,166
If you want an
outsider's opinion...

747
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:34,708
From what I've seen...

748
01:10:34,791 --> 01:10:36,583
you're all fighting...

749
01:10:36,666 --> 01:10:37,916
but most of you are fighting

750
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,458
to hold on to something
that's already been lost.

751
01:10:44,791 --> 01:10:46,125
And...

752
01:10:47,458 --> 01:10:49,166
it seems to me, Maria and
her friends are the ones

753
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:51,583
fighting for
what's still left...

754
01:11:54,833 --> 01:11:57,750
What do you mean, "All
foreigners are being deported"?

755
01:11:57,833 --> 01:11:59,583
It doesn't make any sense!

756
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,125
Leon...!

757
01:12:27,958 --> 01:12:28,916
Maria...

758
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,416
Come to America with me.

759
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:36,458
Is there a problem...?

760
01:12:36,541 --> 01:12:38,583
You need a valid
departure permit.

761
01:12:38,666 --> 01:12:39,958
I have one...

762
01:12:40,041 --> 01:12:42,208
Lt. Commander Leon
Fayden requested it.

763
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:43,125
No, ma'am...

764
01:12:43,208 --> 01:12:44,666
I show no record of that.

765
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:45,833
So check again...

766
01:12:45,916 --> 01:12:47,166
There's been a mistake.

767
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:49,125
I'm going to have to ask you
to come with me...

768
01:12:49,208 --> 01:12:50,000
Let's go...

769
01:12:50,083 --> 01:12:51,958
Step out of the car, please.

770
01:12:52,041 --> 01:12:53,166
Easy now.

771
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:57,041
I'm telling you--At
least let me call him!

772
01:12:57,125 --> 01:12:59,708
Communication with the airport
is currently restricted.

773
01:13:01,625 --> 01:13:02,791
I'm going with you.

774
01:13:04,625 --> 01:13:05,500
Your mission...

775
01:13:05,583 --> 01:13:06,625
I wanna help.

776
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:08,791
No.

777
01:13:08,875 --> 01:13:10,041
It's our problem.

778
01:13:10,125 --> 01:13:12,208
This is bigger than that now,
and you know it.

779
01:13:13,666 --> 01:13:15,875
You and your people
had your chance already...

780
01:13:16,958 --> 01:13:18,833
We never asked for your help.

781
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:21,750
What about Leon?

782
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:23,833
He volunteered to come
here because of you!

783
01:13:31,791 --> 01:13:33,041
Maria...

784
01:13:33,125 --> 01:13:35,291
I'm begging, take me
to Daiwa with you.

785
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:41,875
My decision is final.

786
01:13:41,958 --> 01:13:43,458
It's nothing personal.

787
01:13:46,041 --> 01:13:48,291
You want to help Leon
as much as I do!

788
01:14:04,375 --> 01:14:05,625
What's wrong...?

789
01:14:06,833 --> 01:14:08,000
Hey!

790
01:14:08,083 --> 01:14:09,291
Takashi...

791
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:10,000
It's alright.

792
01:14:10,083 --> 01:14:11,291
Hang on.

793
01:14:12,416 --> 01:14:13,708
Takashi!

794
01:14:15,791 --> 01:14:16,916
No...

795
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:21,875
Fight it!

796
01:14:55,041 --> 01:14:56,833
No...

797
01:14:56,916 --> 01:14:58,125
Takashi...

798
01:15:02,375 --> 01:15:03,958
Takashi...!!

799
01:15:07,791 --> 01:15:08,416
How could you?!

800
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,208
You're inhuman!

801
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:39,166
Please...

802
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:42,208
Try to understand...

803
01:15:42,291 --> 01:15:44,416
It had to be done...

804
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,291
Otherwise...

805
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:49,000
Daiwa would know our plans.

806
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:15,291
Vexille...

807
01:17:17,208 --> 01:17:19,875
We need a replacement
for Takashi.

808
01:17:36,041 --> 01:17:38,500
Once we're in the tunnel,
it's going to be tight.

809
01:17:38,583 --> 01:17:39,666
Even at full throttle,

810
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:41,958
we'll barely have
the speed to make it.

811
01:17:42,041 --> 01:17:45,208
As much as you can, hold a
straight line down the middle.

812
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:48,541
Touch the brakes, even for
an instant, and you're done.

813
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:52,500
We'll be mounting
a two-pronged assault.

814
01:17:52,583 --> 01:17:55,416
Team Red will follow me
to Tunnel One in the east.

815
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:56,625
Team Black will head west

816
01:17:56,708 --> 01:17:59,916
with Saga to make
a run at Tunnel Three.

817
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,541
This is the first time we've
moved so many units all at once.

818
01:18:03,625 --> 01:18:05,166
There's no way of
knowing how many Jags

819
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:07,458
we'll pick up along the way.

820
01:18:07,541 --> 01:18:08,875
Just remember...

821
01:18:08,958 --> 01:18:12,125
no matter what happens,
keep moving, don't give up...

822
01:18:12,208 --> 01:18:15,666
Our plan will succeed if even
one of us makes it through.

823
01:18:18,916 --> 01:18:20,083
Daiwa...

824
01:18:20,166 --> 01:18:22,458
They can rob us
of our country,...

825
01:18:22,541 --> 01:18:24,708
Take our bodies and our minds...

826
01:18:26,416 --> 01:18:29,416
But right now,
we're still human...

827
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:32,083
Let's show them
they can't take our pride!

828
01:19:44,958 --> 01:19:46,125
Maria...

829
01:19:46,208 --> 01:19:47,375
those Jags are riding
a little too close...

830
01:19:48,208 --> 01:19:49,166
Murata.

831
01:19:50,125 --> 01:19:51,125
Got it.

832
01:19:51,208 --> 01:19:52,416
I'll fall back
and take 'em off you.

833
01:20:14,708 --> 01:20:15,791
Black to red!

834
01:20:15,875 --> 01:20:17,750
Go ahead, Black.

835
01:20:17,833 --> 01:20:19,500
We're comin' up
on the tunnel now.

836
01:20:22,958 --> 01:20:24,166
We're goin' in!

837
01:20:26,375 --> 01:20:27,458
Good luck.

838
01:20:27,541 --> 01:20:28,708
Murata, break off!

839
01:20:42,875 --> 01:20:45,250
Murata...!!

840
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:09,500
Black here!

841
01:21:09,583 --> 01:21:10,583
We're through the gate!

842
01:21:29,041 --> 01:21:30,333
I got this one!

843
01:21:58,083 --> 01:21:59,708
Second gate clear!

844
01:22:39,958 --> 01:22:41,208
I'm past the third gate.

845
01:22:41,291 --> 01:22:42,083
Just me.

846
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:43,708
Rest of my team didn't make it.

847
01:22:54,333 --> 01:22:54,916
Maria!

848
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:55,916
The gate's clear!

849
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,166
I'll keep 'em off you!

850
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:58,833
Circle back and
make another run!

851
01:22:59,958 --> 01:23:00,958
On it.

852
01:23:14,166 --> 01:23:15,166
The Jags are on the wire.

853
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:16,791
They already crashed the gates.

854
01:23:16,875 --> 01:23:18,333
They're right on my ass!

855
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,125
Maria!

856
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,291
Vexille!

857
01:25:37,125 --> 01:25:38,291
One left!

858
01:25:50,291 --> 01:25:51,208
Maria!

859
01:27:20,791 --> 01:27:22,291
No...

860
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:33,583
Now there's an entrance!

861
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:37,541
But it looks like you weren't
expecting the tunnel to be

862
01:27:37,625 --> 01:27:40,375
so far from the main facility.

863
01:27:43,083 --> 01:27:44,875
That's too bad...

864
01:27:44,958 --> 01:27:48,208
Jags aren't much
in the way of jumpers.

865
01:27:51,375 --> 01:27:54,333
Your "Chairman" Itakura
told us everything.

866
01:28:55,875 --> 01:28:57,208
Leon!

867
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:01,875
Nice to see you again, Maria.

868
01:29:09,041 --> 01:29:12,791
We've come a long way
since our old school days...

869
01:29:15,041 --> 01:29:17,625
I still remember
our last meeting...

870
01:29:17,708 --> 01:29:20,166
In ten years,
you haven't changed a bit...

871
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:22,375
Still as beautiful as ever.

872
01:29:22,458 --> 01:29:24,458
And as dangerous...

873
01:29:24,541 --> 01:29:26,083
Kisaragi...

874
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:34,375
Bureau of Public Security...!

875
01:29:34,458 --> 01:29:35,750
This is an illegal facility!

876
01:29:35,833 --> 01:29:36,250
You.

877
01:29:36,333 --> 01:29:36,875
Don't move.

878
01:29:36,958 --> 01:29:38,208
Hands in front.

879
01:29:43,541 --> 01:29:44,833
Maria...

880
01:29:44,916 --> 01:29:47,333
I warned you
this day was coming.

881
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:01,875
Ah, the irony of fate...

882
01:30:01,958 --> 01:30:04,625
To think you'd see
this face one last time...

883
01:30:07,708 --> 01:30:08,250
No!

884
01:30:08,333 --> 01:30:09,708
Get away from him!

885
01:30:26,583 --> 01:30:28,541
"Insufficient evidence?"

886
01:30:29,708 --> 01:30:31,166
It seems we're too late.

887
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:35,541
Daiwa is already beyond the
reach of public law enforcement.

888
01:30:35,625 --> 01:30:38,041
Forget the number of
treaties they've violated...

889
01:30:38,125 --> 01:30:40,750
That research is a
danger to the human race!

890
01:30:42,041 --> 01:30:43,958
They were acquitted
this morning.

891
01:30:51,208 --> 01:30:54,958
This is the dawn of
a new age in human evolution...

892
01:30:55,041 --> 01:30:57,333
At long last,
the time has come...

893
01:30:57,416 --> 01:31:00,625
to realize our potential,
to free our species from

894
01:31:00,708 --> 01:31:03,375
the shackles placed
upon it by nature.

895
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:05,750
You call this evolution...?

896
01:31:19,125 --> 01:31:20,458
Don't you understand?

897
01:31:20,541 --> 01:31:23,750
The bodies we now possess
represent perfection.

898
01:31:23,833 --> 01:31:25,791
We have harnessed the
power of our intellect,

899
01:31:25,875 --> 01:31:28,291
uninhibited by emotion.

900
01:31:28,375 --> 01:31:29,750
We need neither food...

901
01:31:29,833 --> 01:31:31,125
nor sleep...

902
01:31:32,166 --> 01:31:33,166
and most of all...

903
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:35,916
immortality is now
within our grasp.

904
01:31:38,791 --> 01:31:41,000
Seriously, what's not to like?

905
01:31:44,291 --> 01:31:45,541
Oh, Maria...

906
01:31:45,625 --> 01:31:48,041
You'll see things
my way soon enough.

907
01:31:52,083 --> 01:31:55,083
Natural selection
will run its course...

908
01:31:55,166 --> 01:31:57,375
Only those most
worthy will evolve...

909
01:31:57,458 --> 01:32:00,250
and a new human race
will be born...

910
01:32:00,333 --> 01:32:04,875
Man--recreated in his own image.

911
01:32:04,958 --> 01:32:07,333
This is the work of a god!

912
01:32:07,416 --> 01:32:10,166
And that god is me!

913
01:32:14,458 --> 01:32:16,416
He's insane...

914
01:32:23,958 --> 01:32:24,875
Still...

915
01:32:24,958 --> 01:32:26,791
there is much to be done...

916
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:29,583
and test subjects here
are in short supply...

917
01:32:31,416 --> 01:32:35,333
Fortunately for me,
your country has plenty...

918
01:32:35,416 --> 01:32:36,583
Like Leon.

919
01:32:36,666 --> 01:32:39,833
An entire nation
of ideal guinea pigs.

920
01:33:12,416 --> 01:33:15,125
So you're a god, huh?

921
01:33:15,208 --> 01:33:17,791
Well, you still
bleed like a human!

922
01:33:25,291 --> 01:33:27,875
And what would we have done
if something happened to me...?

923
01:33:27,958 --> 01:33:30,083
It would have been disastrous...

924
01:33:30,166 --> 01:33:31,375
Listen...!

925
01:33:31,458 --> 01:33:33,333
Once the experiment was
a success and my safety

926
01:33:33,416 --> 01:33:35,875
could be guaranteed, of course
I was going to take part

927
01:33:35,958 --> 01:33:37,166
in the evolution...!

928
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:39,291
All for one man's
sick delusion...

929
01:33:39,375 --> 01:33:40,791
Think of all we've accomplished!

930
01:33:40,875 --> 01:33:42,000
All I've given you!

931
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:43,083
Eternal life!

932
01:33:43,166 --> 01:33:44,208
It's thanks to me!

933
01:33:44,291 --> 01:33:46,208
Thanks to my research!

934
01:33:46,291 --> 01:33:47,333
You're perfect now!

935
01:33:47,416 --> 01:33:48,583
Cured of human impulse!

936
01:33:48,666 --> 01:33:50,125
This is beneath you!

937
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,250
Stop...

938
01:33:54,333 --> 01:33:55,583
Saito...

939
01:33:55,666 --> 01:33:57,541
This is a mistake...!

940
01:34:12,833 --> 01:34:14,208
We have a breach
in the outer wall.

941
01:34:14,291 --> 01:34:16,125
The city gates are opening!

942
01:34:27,333 --> 01:34:28,333
Sir...

943
01:34:28,416 --> 01:34:30,791
you have the
citizens' full support.

944
01:34:34,416 --> 01:34:35,666
This is...

945
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:37,416
Chairman Itakura.

946
01:34:39,208 --> 01:34:40,291
Today...

947
01:34:40,375 --> 01:34:42,208
as you now know...

948
01:34:42,291 --> 01:34:45,708
Many of our comrades were
betrayed, by hesitation on

949
01:34:45,791 --> 01:34:48,958
the part of myself
and the council.

950
01:34:49,041 --> 01:34:51,875
But because of your
courageous decision,

951
01:34:51,958 --> 01:34:55,458
we now have a chance to
atone for those mistakes.

952
01:35:01,541 --> 01:35:02,958
Thank you...

953
01:35:03,041 --> 01:35:04,208
Everyone.

954
01:35:04,291 --> 01:35:06,125
Chairman Itakura...

955
01:35:42,916 --> 01:35:45,333
Cut the central tunnel
from the main facility!

956
01:35:45,416 --> 01:35:47,958
Sir, I show that we still
have a carrier en route...

957
01:35:48,041 --> 01:35:49,750
Should we wait for it to clear?

958
01:35:49,833 --> 01:35:52,041
No, don't let it through...!

959
01:35:52,125 --> 01:35:53,416
Detach the tunnel!

960
01:35:55,083 --> 01:35:57,333
Do not let that carrier
reach headquarters!

961
01:36:12,458 --> 01:36:13,875
Too late.

962
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:22,333
Piece of junk.

963
01:36:33,541 --> 01:36:35,583
This is just
a temporary setback...

964
01:36:35,666 --> 01:36:38,916
as long as I have my research
the world will still be mine!

965
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,166
Be sure to say goodbye to the
Jags for me when they get here.

966
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,500
I'll go after Kisaragi.

967
01:37:47,583 --> 01:37:48,958
Take care of Leon.

968
01:37:49,041 --> 01:37:50,833
No, Kisaragi's mine!

969
01:37:51,708 --> 01:37:53,541
You can't run with that leg.

970
01:37:56,875 --> 01:37:58,250
Keep him safe.

971
01:40:25,791 --> 01:40:27,208
Maria...

972
01:40:28,625 --> 01:40:30,916
Why didn't you come...?

973
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:31,708
The airport.

974
01:40:31,791 --> 01:40:33,125
I waited...

975
01:40:54,208 --> 01:40:56,416
You know, as much as
I hate machines...

976
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:59,000
It's people like you,
who really piss me off!

977
01:41:05,166 --> 01:41:06,500
Vexille!

978
01:41:34,708 --> 01:41:35,875
Vexille.

979
01:41:37,833 --> 01:41:39,125
Where's Maria?

980
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,208
Stay back...!

981
01:42:04,291 --> 01:42:05,125
Do you hear me...?!

982
01:42:05,208 --> 01:42:07,250
Don't come any closer!

983
01:42:07,333 --> 01:42:09,000
You metal bitch!

984
01:42:09,083 --> 01:42:10,500
The Jags are coming!

985
01:42:10,583 --> 01:42:11,708
Maria!

986
01:42:15,875 --> 01:42:16,208
No!

987
01:42:16,291 --> 01:42:16,708
Maria!

988
01:42:16,791 --> 01:42:18,166
Run!

989
01:42:19,083 --> 01:42:20,583
Now I've got you...

990
01:42:20,666 --> 01:42:22,750
This time I'm not letting go.

991
01:42:53,291 --> 01:42:56,000
Maria...

992
01:45:04,708 --> 01:45:06,125
In the end...

993
01:45:06,208 --> 01:45:08,458
the Jags came from all
over Japan to get a piece

994
01:45:08,541 --> 01:45:11,000
of Daiwa headquarters...

995
01:45:11,083 --> 01:45:13,833
then, sank into the sea...

996
01:45:15,125 --> 01:45:18,000
Maria and her people
were wiped out...

997
01:45:18,083 --> 01:45:19,416
But what they did...

998
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:21,416
their sacrifice...

999
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:23,583
it won't be forgotten.

1000
01:45:23,666 --> 01:45:28,708
They will live on in our hearts,
a shining example to the world.

1001
01:45:28,791 --> 01:45:31,083
It was Maria who taught us...

1002
01:45:31,166 --> 01:45:35,041
what we are is more than
just flesh and blood...

1003
01:45:35,125 --> 01:45:38,291
As long as we have our
spirit, then nothing...

1004
01:45:38,375 --> 01:45:39,416
no one...

1005
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:41,958
can ever take away
our humanity...
