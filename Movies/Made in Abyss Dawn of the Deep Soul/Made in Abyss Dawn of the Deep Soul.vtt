00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:36.406
[wind blowing]

00:00:45.625 --> 00:00:48.798
[Nanachi grunting]

00:01:01.523 --> 00:01:03.293
[Nanachi groans]

00:01:12.177 --> 00:01:14.115
[Nanachi sighs]

00:01:14.712 --> 00:01:16.516
What is it with cave raiders?

00:01:16.616 --> 00:01:18.586
Why are their maps so big?

00:01:18.686 --> 00:01:21.058
[Riko] They say it's to
prevent unauthorized raiding.

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:22.828
Details are spread by word of
mouth,

00:01:22.928 --> 00:01:24.298
but this is a little different.

00:01:24.398 --> 00:01:25.801
[Reg] Riko got this
information

00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:27.805
from Ozen and Lyza's letter.

00:01:27.905 --> 00:01:29.141
It'll be all right, Nanachi.

00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:31.446
Let's just trust in
Riko and keep going.

00:01:31.546 --> 00:01:32.881
[Nanachi] Fine with me.

00:01:32.981 --> 00:01:36.155
Gotta respect the instincts
of our fearless leader.

00:01:38.293 --> 00:01:39.094
[Nanachi sighs]

00:01:39.195 --> 00:01:40.197
Whoa.

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:42.134
[Nanachi] We're here.

00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:45.207
The Garden of the
Flowers of Fortitude.

00:01:49.281 --> 00:01:53.556
I can't believe these
are all eternal fortunes.

00:01:53.656 --> 00:01:55.360
[Nanachi] Don't go
up the top of the hill,

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.264
you'll get hit with strains.

00:01:57.364 --> 00:01:58.833
[Riko] Okay.

00:02:04.011 --> 00:02:06.749
It's the same place
I saw before.

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:09.922
Hey, Reg, is
something the matter?

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.060
No, nothing.

00:02:12.161 --> 00:02:13.563
I'm catching up.

00:02:13.663 --> 00:02:15.967
-[distant moan]
-[Reg gasps]

00:02:16.068 --> 00:02:18.573
[moaning]

00:02:18.673 --> 00:02:19.875
Nanachi...

00:02:19.975 --> 00:02:22.347
I heard it too.
There's several of them.

00:02:22.447 --> 00:02:24.785
-Riko!
-Hm?

00:02:29.261 --> 00:02:31.299
[electrical zooming]

00:02:32.835 --> 00:02:36.209
[Reg] At the foot of the
hill, cave raiders.

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:39.114
A few of them have collapsed.
We have to-

00:02:39.215 --> 00:02:41.419
I'm... I'm going to see
what's going on.

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:42.955
Don't get yourself caught.

00:02:43.056 --> 00:02:44.792
And remember what I told you.

00:02:44.892 --> 00:02:46.362
Your word is law.

00:02:46.462 --> 00:02:48.233
That's right, now go ahead.

00:02:52.674 --> 00:02:55.981
Riko, if you see anything
strange, tell me.

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.255
I'll watch over the force field.

00:03:00.991 --> 00:03:01.993
Hm?

00:03:02.094 --> 00:03:04.698
The consciousnesses
are in total disarray.

00:03:04.798 --> 00:03:06.802
Are they confused or something?

00:03:06.903 --> 00:03:09.542
-What's that?
-Something wrong?

00:03:09.642 --> 00:03:12.114
The thing that
person's carrying...

00:03:12.614 --> 00:03:13.983
Is that...

00:03:14.585 --> 00:03:16.322
[Nanachi gasps]

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.000
Stop, Reg, don't move.

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:25.040
[clicking sound]

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.313
No way. What is
he doing out here?

00:03:28.413 --> 00:03:29.848
[Reg] What's wrong, Nanachi?

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:32.354
[Nanachi] <i>That's a member</i>
<i>of the Umbra Hands.</i>

00:03:32.454 --> 00:03:36.062
<i>The personal cave raider squad</i>
<i>of the Sovereign of Dawn,</i>

00:03:36.162 --> 00:03:37.264
<i>Bondrewd.</i>

00:03:37.364 --> 00:03:39.034
Wait, for Bondrewd?

00:03:39.134 --> 00:03:42.007
But isn't that you and
Mitty's bitter enemy?

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.182
[creaking]

00:03:46.282 --> 00:03:46.983
[Reg shudders]

00:03:47.084 --> 00:03:48.586
[Nanachi] <i>At your feet!</i>

00:03:48.686 --> 00:03:50.257
<i>Turn to your right!</i>

00:03:53.096 --> 00:03:55.667
Are you the one responsible
for that screaming?

00:03:55.767 --> 00:03:58.006
[clicking and creaking]

00:03:58.706 --> 00:04:00.877
You answer me right now!

00:04:01.646 --> 00:04:02.581
[Umbra Hand] Shh.

00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:04.218
You will wake them.

00:04:05.754 --> 00:04:08.493
Indeed, I am the cause
of what you heard.

00:04:08.593 --> 00:04:11.933
Incidentally, this area has
been designated off limits

00:04:12.034 --> 00:04:14.405
for over 60 surface days now.

00:04:15.273 --> 00:04:16.475
What was that?

00:04:16.575 --> 00:04:18.980
[Umbra Hand] So you entered
without knowing then?

00:04:19.081 --> 00:04:21.585
Well, that's understandable.

00:04:21.686 --> 00:04:23.489
[Reg grunts]

00:04:29.568 --> 00:04:30.537
Mm?

00:04:30.637 --> 00:04:32.107
Is this the...

00:04:32.207 --> 00:04:34.545
Oh, wow. It's the Blaze Reap.

00:04:34.645 --> 00:04:36.849
[Umbra Hand] Do not
drop it again.

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:37.985
[Reg] How did you...

00:04:38.086 --> 00:04:39.655
[Umbra Hand]
Allow me to reiterate,

00:04:39.755 --> 00:04:41.726
this area is off limits.

00:04:41.826 --> 00:04:44.798
Tell the furry one and
your other friend as well.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.702
But how did you--

00:04:46.802 --> 00:04:48.339
[Nanachi] <i>Reg,</i>
<i>don't say any more</i>

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:50.443
<i>than you have to.</i>

00:04:50.543 --> 00:04:53.416
That bastard. We've been
under his surveillance.

00:04:53.516 --> 00:04:55.854
<i>I wonder how long he's</i>
<i>been watching us.</i>

00:04:55.954 --> 00:04:58.760
Nanachi, what is it?
Are you alright?

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.198
I'm gonna try and find
out what he's up to.

00:05:01.299 --> 00:05:02.801
-[Nanachi] No, wait, that's not-
-Leave it to me.

00:05:02.901 --> 00:05:04.171
I've got this.

00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:07.244
[Reg] <i>Any enemy of yours</i>
<i>is an enemy of mine.</i>

00:05:07.344 --> 00:05:09.081
Look, we will decide
what we're doing

00:05:09.181 --> 00:05:12.187
just as soon as I see
what it is you're up to.

00:05:17.564 --> 00:05:19.168
Follow me.

00:05:22.941 --> 00:05:24.812
[Riko chuckles]

00:05:29.421 --> 00:05:31.492
[Riko] That's an insect.

00:05:32.728 --> 00:05:34.498
It looks just like a leaf.

00:05:34.598 --> 00:05:37.471
Wait, this is a...

00:05:39.875 --> 00:05:42.381
Riko? What are
you looking for?

00:05:42.481 --> 00:05:43.916
Oh!

00:05:44.752 --> 00:05:46.889
[Riko] Nanachi, look here.

00:05:46.989 --> 00:05:49.361
[Nanachi] "Be careful
in the flower fields

00:05:49.461 --> 00:05:50.497
of the sixth layer.

00:05:50.597 --> 00:05:52.901
If you spot one of these
guys among the leaves,

00:05:53.002 --> 00:05:54.438
you found their nest.

00:05:54.538 --> 00:05:57.878
They disguise themselves
as flowers of fortitude...

00:05:57.978 --> 00:06:00.050
[Lyza] ...then they attack
and implant their larva

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.587
inside organisms that
come near them.

00:06:02.687 --> 00:06:05.460
[violin music]

00:06:08.032 --> 00:06:11.772
[raider grunting]

00:06:11.872 --> 00:06:14.311
[Umbra Hand] They were
discovered just recently.

00:06:14.411 --> 00:06:17.851
The larvae had already
managed to enter the head

00:06:17.951 --> 00:06:21.125
and find the perfect
living meal for themselves.

00:06:21.225 --> 00:06:23.496
Down here, innumerable
primeval creatures

00:06:23.596 --> 00:06:26.936
have been unwittingly turned
into living food sources.

00:06:27.037 --> 00:06:29.074
So that's why this
is off limits.

00:06:29.174 --> 00:06:32.748
They've created a massive
nest within that mound.

00:06:32.848 --> 00:06:35.086
The insects predatory
adult form is spread

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:36.422
throughout the flower garden,

00:06:36.522 --> 00:06:39.094
hibernating and waiting
for the signal.

00:06:39.862 --> 00:06:41.132
The signal?

00:06:41.232 --> 00:06:44.638
[raider grunting]

00:06:47.344 --> 00:06:49.014
It-- it went in his mouth.

00:06:49.114 --> 00:06:51.118
[Umbra Hand] They feed some
of themselves to the victims

00:06:51.218 --> 00:06:54.958
in order to make the living
food sources last longer.

00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:56.562
I've already
collected a specimen

00:06:56.662 --> 00:06:58.065
from one of their abdomens.

00:06:58.166 --> 00:07:00.537
It was then that he
let out a scream.

00:07:00.637 --> 00:07:02.908
Well, a reflexive response.

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:05.079
That would be what you heard.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.087
These creatures, which are
called "amaranthine-deceptors,"

00:07:09.188 --> 00:07:11.692
came from the sixth
layer and essentially

00:07:11.792 --> 00:07:13.296
should not be here.

00:07:13.396 --> 00:07:16.235
The sheer number of them
has proved unmanageable.

00:07:16.335 --> 00:07:19.241
[Reg] <i>So your boss,</i>
<i>what's he doing about it?</i>

00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:21.545
The person you speak of
is not currently present.

00:07:21.645 --> 00:07:25.286
The method for straddling
layers is prone to difficulties.

00:07:28.292 --> 00:07:32.000
[raiders groaning]

00:07:35.807 --> 00:07:37.978
[groaning continues]

00:07:39.214 --> 00:07:40.850
That would be the signal.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.022
We must move quickly.

00:07:44.024 --> 00:07:45.293
[Reg] What are you
talking about?

00:07:45.393 --> 00:07:47.931
Burning agents have been
dispersed in key areas

00:07:48.032 --> 00:07:49.568
around the region.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.676
[torch blazing]

00:07:59.188 --> 00:08:01.158
Wait, what the hell
are you doing?

00:08:01.258 --> 00:08:03.462
Aren't there still cave
raiders alive in there?

00:08:03.563 --> 00:08:05.166
[Umbra Hand] The adult
insects are entering

00:08:05.266 --> 00:08:06.335
their active period.

00:08:06.435 --> 00:08:08.039
You must know there's no
saving them.

00:08:08.139 --> 00:08:09.575
That can't be.

00:08:09.675 --> 00:08:12.247
Oh, come on. There must
be something we can do!

00:08:12.347 --> 00:08:14.585
-[Nanachi] Reg!
-[Reg gasps]

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.657
[Umbra Hand] Do what exactly?

00:08:17.757 --> 00:08:19.428
Don't say such
ridiculous things.

00:08:19.528 --> 00:08:23.069
I can't protect Riko all
on my own. Get back here.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.073
Nothing, I guess.

00:08:25.173 --> 00:08:27.043
I suppose I can't do anything.

00:08:27.143 --> 00:08:29.014
Return to your friends.

00:08:29.114 --> 00:08:31.352
The Sovereign of Dawn
has been eagerly awaiting

00:08:31.452 --> 00:08:33.623
the arrival of
all three of you.

00:08:34.224 --> 00:08:36.495
[fire blazing]

00:08:41.372 --> 00:08:43.476
[Reg] <i>As for what a decent</i>

00:08:56.468 --> 00:08:58.573
[Reg screams]

00:09:00.276 --> 00:09:03.616
They're going for any
orifice they can find!

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.467
[Nanachi] We're even
out of their territory.

00:09:12.567 --> 00:09:13.636
Pesky little things.

00:09:13.736 --> 00:09:15.306
Look, Reg's coming.

00:09:20.717 --> 00:09:22.020
[Reg coughs]

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.689
Are you two okay?

00:09:23.789 --> 00:09:25.159
Did you get hurt?

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.900
[Nanachi] Um, you're drenched
in bug juice, you know?

00:09:29.001 --> 00:09:32.307
[Reg] Besides all the bugs, the
fire is consuming all the air.

00:09:32.407 --> 00:09:34.511
Let's hurry and get out of here.

00:09:36.916 --> 00:09:38.219
Nanachi, I'm sorry.

00:09:38.319 --> 00:09:39.554
Things went bad before

00:09:39.655 --> 00:09:41.825
I could figure out how
we're being watched.

00:09:41.926 --> 00:09:43.129
Don't worry about it.

00:09:43.229 --> 00:09:45.800
No way you could
have seen this coming.

00:09:52.514 --> 00:09:54.551
[Nanachi] This is terrible.

00:09:56.155 --> 00:09:58.592
The field of flowers
that Mom loved...

00:09:58.693 --> 00:10:00.229
It's burning away.

00:10:39.408 --> 00:10:40.710
<i>For unless they pass</i>

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:43.783
<i>through the deepest</i>
<i>shadows of darkness,</i>

00:10:43.883 --> 00:10:46.355
<i>the dawn shall never come.</i>

00:10:46.989 --> 00:10:50.630
[emotional chorus music]

00:11:39.661 --> 00:11:41.231
Wow!

00:11:53.256 --> 00:11:56.897
[Nanachi] I came from the lowest
part of the depths' fifth layer,

00:11:56.997 --> 00:11:59.669
a place known as "Ido Front."

00:11:59.769 --> 00:12:02.074
Bondrewd's miniature
garden is the last place

00:12:02.174 --> 00:12:04.980
where a person can
return still human.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.152
It is also where White Whistles
descend for their last dives

00:12:08.253 --> 00:12:11.092
and the only entrance
to the sixth layer.

00:12:11.192 --> 00:12:14.498
Although I seriously doubt
Bondrewd will allow us

00:12:14.599 --> 00:12:15.968
to simply pass through.

00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:18.273
We cannot avoid an
encounter with him,

00:12:18.373 --> 00:12:19.676
so keep your guard up.

00:12:19.776 --> 00:12:20.912
[Riko] I had a
feeling you'd swell up

00:12:21.012 --> 00:12:22.916
where you got bitten.

00:12:24.719 --> 00:12:28.326
I told you it's not
really a problem, okay?

00:12:28.426 --> 00:12:29.863
[reg grumbles]

00:12:29.963 --> 00:12:31.633
[distant explosion]

00:12:31.733 --> 00:12:33.069
What the heck was that?

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:35.942
One of the water supports
must have collapsed.

00:12:37.477 --> 00:12:40.885
[explosion rumbles]

00:12:48.366 --> 00:12:52.274
[Nanachi] Looks like a new path
has formed. Be very careful.

00:13:00.925 --> 00:13:02.795
[Riko gasps]

00:13:02.895 --> 00:13:05.400
It's not gonna crumble
out from under us, is it?

00:13:05.501 --> 00:13:06.503
[Nanachi] Don't worry.

00:13:06.603 --> 00:13:07.772
It might only be frost,

00:13:07.872 --> 00:13:09.943
but these water supports
are crystallized.

00:13:10.043 --> 00:13:13.617
A little jumping
around won't hurt 'em.

00:13:13.717 --> 00:13:15.186
[Reg] So, uh...

00:13:15.286 --> 00:13:17.124
I don't see any living
creatures around.

00:13:17.224 --> 00:13:20.531
I take it that there's
no life in this area?

00:13:21.767 --> 00:13:23.202
Uh, let me see.

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:25.407
Ah! Hamashirama.

00:13:27.979 --> 00:13:31.452
[soft playful music]

00:13:34.993 --> 00:13:37.932
[creature wailing]

00:13:45.748 --> 00:13:47.217
Is that thing edible?

00:13:47.317 --> 00:13:50.190
Yeah, it says that
it's not poisonous.

00:13:56.369 --> 00:13:59.274
[sloshing sound]

00:13:59.375 --> 00:14:02.280
[Reg] Seems like there's twice
as much slime as flesh.

00:14:02.381 --> 00:14:04.451
If you overdo it,
it'll start to get tough.

00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:07.424
It's supposed to taste
best when it's raw.

00:14:12.234 --> 00:14:15.173
Honestly, this is
gonna take some courage.

00:14:15.908 --> 00:14:19.682
[Nanachi screams]

00:14:19.783 --> 00:14:22.287
[Reg] <i>Freaking out</i>
<i>isn't gonna help.</i>

00:14:28.567 --> 00:14:30.070
Hey, it's sweet.

00:14:35.346 --> 00:14:38.954
Mm. It has really
good flavor.

00:14:39.054 --> 00:14:41.158
You can't judge it based
on looks alone, huh?

00:14:41.258 --> 00:14:44.164
Mm-hm. Check it out, Riko.

00:14:44.264 --> 00:14:47.003
What a wonderful sight that is.

00:14:47.471 --> 00:14:49.441
[nervous sigh]

00:14:55.521 --> 00:14:56.857
[delighted sigh]

00:14:56.957 --> 00:14:59.128
[Riko and Reg laughing]

00:15:00.865 --> 00:15:02.267
Hey, Nanachi,

00:15:02.367 --> 00:15:04.304
you think we should make
the other one into a stew?

00:15:04.405 --> 00:15:05.875
You mean it?

00:15:06.877 --> 00:15:08.179
Uh, Riko...

00:15:08.279 --> 00:15:11.185
Could you maybe teach
me to make it this time?

00:15:11.285 --> 00:15:14.626
Mm-hm. Why don't we
cook it together?

00:15:25.548 --> 00:15:28.687
[Reg] You were quite
enthusiastic about being taught.

00:15:30.256 --> 00:15:32.528
I'm the industrious
type, you know?

00:15:32.628 --> 00:15:36.302
I'm not satisfied with being
on the same level as you.

00:15:43.851 --> 00:15:45.286
And well, Mitty...

00:15:45.386 --> 00:15:48.627
All she ate in the
Abyss were just dry

00:15:48.727 --> 00:15:50.363
and tasteless food bars.

00:15:50.463 --> 00:15:55.240
So that's why I've gotta be
able to prepare some tasty food

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:59.014
so that if I am ever
able to see Mitty again,

00:15:59.114 --> 00:16:01.887
I might get to feed her
something that's good.

00:16:01.987 --> 00:16:03.256
I feel bad that
we weren't able

00:16:03.356 --> 00:16:05.360
to eat this kind
of stuff together.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.132
Stuff that tastes good,
I mean.

00:16:10.036 --> 00:16:12.174
[Reg sobbing]

00:16:12.742 --> 00:16:13.844
Nanachi...

00:16:13.944 --> 00:16:14.913
[Nanachi screams]

00:16:15.013 --> 00:16:17.083
You're such a good person!

00:16:18.119 --> 00:16:20.023
Hey, don't take
advantage of the situation,

00:16:20.123 --> 00:16:22.260
you know, I need my space!

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.797
Get off me!

00:16:23.897 --> 00:16:25.968
[Nanachi groans]

00:16:27.337 --> 00:16:30.511
Yeah, yeah. I know it's just
some silly wishful thinking.

00:16:30.611 --> 00:16:33.851
I don't actually expect
I'll get to see her again.

00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:35.621
Don't say stuff like that!

00:16:35.721 --> 00:16:37.190
[Riko] He's right!

00:16:38.694 --> 00:16:41.131
It's way too early for
any of us to give up.

00:16:41.232 --> 00:16:43.604
I mean, this is the
Abyss after all.

00:16:44.606 --> 00:16:47.244
I bet we'll find a way
to see Mitty again

00:16:47.344 --> 00:16:49.749
and figure out the reason
for the curse of the Abyss.

00:16:49.849 --> 00:16:52.688
And understand the secrets of
the Hollows and the relics.

00:16:52.788 --> 00:16:54.491
The answers are waiting for us.

00:16:54.592 --> 00:16:57.732
They're down there waiting
at the Netherworld's bottom.

00:16:59.969 --> 00:17:01.472
Oh, is that right?

00:17:01.573 --> 00:17:04.278
Considering we don't even know
what it actually looks like,

00:17:04.378 --> 00:17:06.750
you sure do seem
confident, Riko.

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:08.085
Of course I am.

00:17:08.185 --> 00:17:10.991
It is where Reg
comes from after all.

00:17:11.091 --> 00:17:12.962
I'm sure it's a wonderful place.

00:17:13.062 --> 00:17:14.732
Come on you two, let's go!

00:17:14.832 --> 00:17:16.468
Now move your butts.

00:17:20.076 --> 00:17:21.646
[Nanachi sighs]

00:17:21.746 --> 00:17:23.984
<i>Dang it.</i>

00:17:24.084 --> 00:17:26.388
<i>This is the adventure</i>
<i>to the bottom.</i>

00:17:26.488 --> 00:17:29.729
<i>I mean, it's exactly</i>
<i>what I've always wanted.</i>

00:17:30.496 --> 00:17:32.100
<i>Dang it.</i>

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.641
<i>This is actually really fun.</i>

00:17:35.741 --> 00:17:37.444
<i>Dang it.</i>

00:17:42.722 --> 00:17:45.126
[grinding sound]

00:17:51.606 --> 00:17:54.545
Look at that building.
It's slowly rotating.

00:17:54.646 --> 00:17:56.549
How's it doing that?

00:17:59.121 --> 00:18:00.691
Nanachi, you all right?

00:18:00.791 --> 00:18:05.099
Yeah. I was just keeping
an eye on the force field.

00:18:05.199 --> 00:18:08.072
See that? There's a
part that isn't moving.

00:18:08.172 --> 00:18:11.613
Unless you use a boat,
that's the only entrance.

00:18:12.314 --> 00:18:14.384
We'll be in clear view.

00:18:14.484 --> 00:18:16.155
So no matter what happens,

00:18:16.255 --> 00:18:18.660
we have to stay alert
and keep going.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.365
This place makes use of
the ruins of what was once

00:18:21.465 --> 00:18:24.104
a ritual site
thousands of years ago.

00:18:24.204 --> 00:18:26.108
You see that tower
in the middle?

00:18:26.208 --> 00:18:28.346
That's for taking
one's last dive.

00:18:28.446 --> 00:18:30.818
It's how one gets
to the sixth layer.

00:18:30.918 --> 00:18:33.322
Oh, so that's it!

00:18:34.726 --> 00:18:37.999
A ritual site is a place
where people pray. Right?

00:18:38.099 --> 00:18:40.336
I wonder if the ancient
people who lived here

00:18:40.436 --> 00:18:43.409
also saw everything below
this point as special.

00:18:44.612 --> 00:18:49.622
[girl] Oh, they all look
about the same size as me.

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:53.329
Okay. Just need to be confident.

00:18:55.199 --> 00:18:57.538
[Reg] So what
should we do now?

00:18:57.638 --> 00:19:01.245
We have no idea how much
these people know about us.

00:19:01.345 --> 00:19:03.049
Try not to speak carelessly.

00:19:03.149 --> 00:19:05.153
Instead, get them
to do the talking.

00:19:05.253 --> 00:19:07.290
Information is power.

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:10.698
No matter what they say,
there's no need to get scared,

00:19:10.798 --> 00:19:11.966
but don't miss anything.

00:19:12.067 --> 00:19:13.436
Understood.

00:19:21.318 --> 00:19:22.855
[all gasping]

00:19:24.859 --> 00:19:26.563
Do you know who that is?

00:19:26.663 --> 00:19:27.832
I don't.

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.877
Are you the guests
here to see Papa?

00:19:33.977 --> 00:19:36.415
You're pretty small, aren't you?

00:19:36.516 --> 00:19:37.017
Papa?

00:19:37.117 --> 00:19:38.720
Let's go.

00:19:40.223 --> 00:19:41.358
[chuckle]

00:19:41.458 --> 00:19:43.129
You did pretty
well to make it here

00:19:43.229 --> 00:19:45.099
even though you're just kids.

00:19:45.199 --> 00:19:48.239
Ah! Hey, excuse me!

00:19:49.041 --> 00:19:50.844
How did you guys get down here?

00:19:50.944 --> 00:19:52.047
Tell me!

00:19:52.147 --> 00:19:53.884
We used crystallized
water support.

00:19:53.984 --> 00:19:56.823
You're kidding! You actually
crossed over the supports?

00:19:56.923 --> 00:19:57.925
They're dangerous!

00:19:58.025 --> 00:20:00.129
[Reg] <i>Information is power.</i>

00:20:00.229 --> 00:20:01.465
[girl] You must be crazy.

00:20:01.566 --> 00:20:02.501
I mean, you never know when one

00:20:02.601 --> 00:20:04.371
of those things will collapse.

00:20:04.471 --> 00:20:06.141
I can tell if you're
lying, you know?

00:20:06.241 --> 00:20:07.210
I've seen it before.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:09.515
So how'd you really get here?

00:20:10.349 --> 00:20:12.320
You're gonna say
something or what?

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.826
Are you mad 'cause
I said you're lying?

00:20:14.926 --> 00:20:17.130
So the silent treatment, huh?

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.936
Oh, do you like my hat?
Wanna touch it?

00:20:20.036 --> 00:20:22.340
<i>Why is she being so casual?</i>

00:20:23.677 --> 00:20:25.948
[Reg] <i>Come on,</i>
<i>help me out here.</i>

00:20:26.916 --> 00:20:29.488
What's the deal? Talk to me.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:32.962
Our names!

00:20:33.062 --> 00:20:34.364
We'll start there!

00:20:34.464 --> 00:20:37.571
My name's Prushka.
And who are you guys?

00:20:37.671 --> 00:20:39.575
Uh, I'm Reg.

00:20:39.675 --> 00:20:40.611
And you?

00:20:40.711 --> 00:20:41.478
Name's Riko.

00:20:41.579 --> 00:20:43.884
[Prushka chuckles]

00:20:43.984 --> 00:20:45.453
What about you?

00:20:45.554 --> 00:20:48.092
You sure are fluffy
and cute, aren't you?

00:20:48.192 --> 00:20:50.062
Are those ears real? You talk?

00:20:50.163 --> 00:20:51.833
Uh... Yeah.

00:20:53.102 --> 00:20:55.106
Oh, Papa!

00:20:55.206 --> 00:20:58.980
[all gasp]

00:21:01.185 --> 00:21:04.959
[echoing footsteps]

00:21:26.903 --> 00:21:28.439
Papa.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.878
Hello there, everyone.

00:21:30.978 --> 00:21:33.115
How nice of you to come.

00:21:33.215 --> 00:21:37.123
Nanachi, I'm glad
to see you're well.

00:21:37.223 --> 00:21:40.062
That hat suits you nicely.

00:21:40.163 --> 00:21:41.599
Oh, that's right.

00:21:41.699 --> 00:21:44.972
The other day your friend's
flesh lamp flickered out.

00:21:45.941 --> 00:21:48.445
Congratulations, Nanachi.

00:21:49.247 --> 00:21:51.853
She has finally been set free.

00:21:51.953 --> 00:21:54.090
[Nanachi whimpers]

00:21:54.191 --> 00:21:57.430
[Reg] Hey, it was
you wasn't it?

00:21:58.633 --> 00:22:02.140
You tortured Nanachi
and Mitty, didn't you?

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:06.649
[Nanachi] Bondrewd, right now I
don't feel like getting into it.

00:22:06.749 --> 00:22:09.555
All we want is to keep
going down into the Abyss.

00:22:09.655 --> 00:22:11.458
Will you let
us pass through?

00:22:11.559 --> 00:22:14.932
Certainly. I don't
mind in the least.

00:22:15.032 --> 00:22:17.805
However, the altar for
taking one's last dive

00:22:17.905 --> 00:22:21.880
is activated by a White Whistle,
and I'm sure you're aware,

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:26.021
a White Whistle may only be
used by its original owner.

00:22:26.121 --> 00:22:30.029
This was made out of the
relic called "Your Worth."

00:22:30.129 --> 00:22:32.433
The life-reverberating stone.

00:22:32.535 --> 00:22:34.337
Even for a parent and child,

00:22:34.437 --> 00:22:36.241
the correct timbre
won't be produced

00:22:36.341 --> 00:22:38.647
if the light insignias differ.

00:22:38.747 --> 00:22:41.018
[Reg] Riko, is that true?

00:22:41.118 --> 00:22:42.487
That's what Habo told me.

00:22:42.588 --> 00:22:44.391
And Ozen did too.

00:22:44.491 --> 00:22:46.863
That type of whistle
can only be used

00:22:46.963 --> 00:22:48.800
by its original owner.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.506
That White Whistle acts
as a sort of key.

00:22:51.606 --> 00:22:54.545
You kids won't be able to
do anything with it, though.

00:22:54.645 --> 00:23:00.022
I thought if I just went,
it would all work out somehow.

00:23:00.122 --> 00:23:01.826
We've been through so much,

00:23:01.926 --> 00:23:04.865
and I thought we could
work something out.

00:23:06.769 --> 00:23:10.476
Hey, Papa, is that girl
also a White Whistle's kid?

00:23:10.577 --> 00:23:12.146
That's correct, Prushka.

00:23:12.247 --> 00:23:14.752
You think you can try
to get along with her?

00:23:14.852 --> 00:23:17.257
-Mm-hm.
-Of course you will.

00:23:17.357 --> 00:23:20.731
You are truly a good child.

00:23:20.831 --> 00:23:22.635
[Bondrewd] I have
prepared a room.

00:23:22.735 --> 00:23:25.106
Why don't you get a little
rest and take some time

00:23:25.206 --> 00:23:26.709
to think things over?

00:23:26.809 --> 00:23:29.949
Prushka, won't you
please show them the way?

00:23:30.049 --> 00:23:31.018
Sure!

00:23:31.118 --> 00:23:33.322
[Prushka laughs]

00:23:33.422 --> 00:23:37.030
Come on, I cleaned
it up all by myself.

00:23:41.706 --> 00:23:43.843
Are you okay, Riko?

00:23:52.661 --> 00:23:59.374
[rising metallic clanking]

00:23:59.474 --> 00:24:02.013
[Prushka] The toilet's in there,
but be careful.

00:24:02.113 --> 00:24:03.850
You'll die if you fall in.

00:24:04.785 --> 00:24:06.088
You can't go up those stairs.

00:24:06.188 --> 00:24:09.194
You'll get hit with the
strains of ascending.

00:24:09.294 --> 00:24:11.098
This is your room.

00:24:11.198 --> 00:24:14.672
This spinny thing turns to
the left to open the door.

00:24:17.443 --> 00:24:19.147
Go on in.

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:24.759
Wow.

00:24:24.859 --> 00:24:28.399
Oh, these are type 4
energy rations.

00:24:28.499 --> 00:24:30.737
Those are the same
food bars as before.

00:24:30.837 --> 00:24:32.373
They're made
for cave raiders

00:24:32.473 --> 00:24:33.877
who travel deeper than
the fourth layer.

00:24:33.977 --> 00:24:35.580
They're a perfectly
nutritious meal.

00:24:35.681 --> 00:24:38.385
-Can we have some?
-Yeah, of course.

00:24:38.485 --> 00:24:40.691
[Nanachi] I think I'll pass.

00:24:44.799 --> 00:24:46.234
- Blah, tastes like a bum.

00:24:46.335 --> 00:24:50.276
-So your name's Riko.
-Mm-hm.

00:24:50.376 --> 00:24:52.614
What does the word Riko mean?

00:24:52.715 --> 00:24:54.618
[Riko] The meaning of my name?

00:24:54.719 --> 00:24:56.388
That's a good question.

00:24:56.488 --> 00:24:58.058
Guess I don't know.

00:24:58.158 --> 00:25:02.568
Well, my name is Prushka and
it means "the flower of dawn."

00:25:02.668 --> 00:25:04.371
Papa is the one who named me.

00:25:04.471 --> 00:25:06.274
Have you guys ever seen a dawn?

00:25:06.375 --> 00:25:07.745
Uh, Prushka...

00:25:07.845 --> 00:25:10.149
Have you never been up
to the surface before?

00:25:10.249 --> 00:25:11.519
Afraid not.

00:25:11.619 --> 00:25:14.024
'Cause I was, like, born
way down here, you know?

00:25:14.124 --> 00:25:17.463
Oh, but I do know what a
dawn is, thank you very much.

00:25:17.564 --> 00:25:18.900
It's when...

00:25:19.568 --> 00:25:20.871
When the light comes on.

00:25:20.971 --> 00:25:22.875
[Nanachi] <i>While he conducted</i>
<i>his experiments</i>

00:25:22.975 --> 00:25:26.649
<i>with complete indifference,</i>
<i>he already had a daughter?</i>

00:25:26.749 --> 00:25:28.185
[Nanachi] <i>What's he</i>
<i>trying to accomplish</i>

00:25:28.285 --> 00:25:29.889
<i>by having her get close to us?</i>

00:25:29.989 --> 00:25:32.493
That's right.
Sea is really big.

00:25:32.594 --> 00:25:34.197
But it's all just water,
right?

00:25:34.297 --> 00:25:35.901
The one down here so much more.

00:25:36.001 --> 00:25:38.907
Oh, there's the second
layer's Inverted Forest.

00:25:39.007 --> 00:25:43.482
The trees grow upside down and
the waterfalls all go upward.

00:25:43.583 --> 00:25:44.919
[Prushka] Really?

00:25:45.019 --> 00:25:47.323
[Nanachi] I thought I told
you information is power.

00:25:47.423 --> 00:25:48.960
Oh, well...

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:51.699
[Riko] I used to live in this
place called Belchero orphanage.

00:25:51.799 --> 00:25:54.437
Unlike the outside,
it's very safe in here.

00:25:54.538 --> 00:25:56.174
Have yourself the good rest.

00:25:56.274 --> 00:25:57.176
[Riko] Thanks.

00:25:57.276 --> 00:25:59.147
Nighty night.

00:25:59.247 --> 00:26:01.619
Night, night, Prushka.

00:26:01.719 --> 00:26:03.923
[Riko yawns]

00:26:05.159 --> 00:26:06.194
Night.

00:26:06.696 --> 00:26:08.833
I sleep now.

00:26:11.572 --> 00:26:13.108
Night, Riko.

00:26:14.578 --> 00:26:16.849
<i>There's no telling what's</i>
<i>going to happen.</i>

00:26:16.949 --> 00:26:20.256
<i>Guess I'll stay prepared</i>
<i>to take action if needed.</i>

00:26:22.059 --> 00:26:24.799
Hey, that pattern
on your head...

00:26:24.899 --> 00:26:28.405
Yeah, uh, it shows up
every time I put it on.

00:26:28.506 --> 00:26:30.443
It looks like some
kind of writing.

00:26:30.544 --> 00:26:33.115
Huh? It's looking
different than before.

00:26:33.215 --> 00:26:36.656
Like it seems to be
diminishing, right?

00:26:36.756 --> 00:26:38.760
[Reg] That looks like the same
pattern.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.398
This is an ancient
relic that produces air.

00:26:41.498 --> 00:26:42.868
[relic hisses]

00:26:42.968 --> 00:26:44.572
But every time it gets used

00:26:44.672 --> 00:26:45.974
the pattern diminishes a little.

00:26:46.074 --> 00:26:48.513
I've seen this on lots
of different relics.

00:26:48.613 --> 00:26:50.684
The pattern indicates
the number of uses left

00:26:50.784 --> 00:26:53.088
until it's done
without exception.

00:26:53.188 --> 00:26:55.827
What? But even though
it's going away,

00:26:55.927 --> 00:26:57.363
I've been just fine,
haven't I?

00:26:57.463 --> 00:27:00.136
That probably means the amount
of energy you use to move

00:27:00.236 --> 00:27:01.873
is insignificant.

00:27:01.973 --> 00:27:05.179
There's only one thing
I can think of, Reg.

00:27:05.279 --> 00:27:06.616
The Incinerator.

00:27:06.716 --> 00:27:10.256
After all, it's powerful
enough to rewrite the rules

00:27:10.356 --> 00:27:12.226
of the Netherworld.

00:27:12.961 --> 00:27:14.732
Judging from the pattern,

00:27:14.832 --> 00:27:16.936
you have about three uses left.

00:27:17.036 --> 00:27:19.040
You should hold off on
firing it for a while.

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.211
-Yeah, but-
-I already told you,

00:27:21.311 --> 00:27:23.382
I cannot protect Riko alone.

00:27:23.482 --> 00:27:26.656
The moment you return to being
a hunk of worthless scrap metal

00:27:26.756 --> 00:27:28.927
is the moment
this adventure ends.

00:27:29.027 --> 00:27:30.997
Well, in that case,
will I be able

00:27:31.097 --> 00:27:33.503
to take him if
it comes to that?

00:27:33.603 --> 00:27:36.776
We'll think of
something, I suppose.

00:27:36.876 --> 00:27:38.713
[light snoring]

00:27:38.813 --> 00:27:40.917
[Nanachi] <i>There must</i>
<i>be some way,</i>

00:27:41.017 --> 00:27:44.625
<i>some way to let these</i>
<i>two continue onward.</i>

00:27:44.725 --> 00:27:48.131
[melancholic music]

00:28:12.179 --> 00:28:13.516
[gasp]

00:28:13.616 --> 00:28:15.754
It'll be all right.

00:28:22.568 --> 00:28:25.907
[footsteps approaching]

00:28:31.819 --> 00:28:34.257
[Bondrewd] Sure enough, Nanachi,

00:28:34.357 --> 00:28:38.967
you are miracles brought forth
by the prodigy of the Abyss.

00:28:39.067 --> 00:28:42.273
How very pleased I am that
you have returned to me.

00:28:42.373 --> 00:28:47.250
Look, Bondrewd, I have
something to discuss.

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:48.786
[Bondrewd] As do I.

00:28:48.886 --> 00:28:52.493
Let us take our time and
talk things over properly.

00:28:57.938 --> 00:28:59.909
[Riko groans]

00:29:00.744 --> 00:29:03.315
I gotta pee.

00:29:05.654 --> 00:29:08.358
Huh? Where is everyone?

00:29:09.962 --> 00:29:12.300
Maybe they had to pee too?

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.740
They must have gone to
the bathroom together.

00:29:23.656 --> 00:29:26.762
[howling wind]

00:29:26.862 --> 00:29:31.104
I wonder where this
toilet ends up.

00:29:31.204 --> 00:29:32.975
[nervous squeal]

00:29:33.576 --> 00:29:37.149
Reg? Nanachi?

00:29:37.249 --> 00:29:38.987
Reg?

00:29:39.087 --> 00:29:40.757
[sigh]

00:29:51.679 --> 00:29:53.583
Where did everyone go?

00:29:53.683 --> 00:29:57.891
I mean, the door we came in
from is closed and won't open.

00:30:00.563 --> 00:30:03.001
<i>There's only one place left.</i>

00:30:08.813 --> 00:30:10.349
[Prushka] <i>You can't go</i>
<i>up those stairs.</i>

00:30:10.449 --> 00:30:13.455
<i>You'll get hit with the</i>
<i>strains of ascending.</i>

00:30:16.161 --> 00:30:18.432
Bondrewd in particular
is an out and out

00:30:18.533 --> 00:30:19.902
reckless scoundrel.

00:30:20.002 --> 00:30:22.574
He's not nearly as kind as I am.

00:30:22.674 --> 00:30:25.580
<i>I have a bad</i>
<i>feeling about this.</i>

00:30:31.358 --> 00:30:32.894
It's all right.

00:30:34.531 --> 00:30:35.900
Take it slow.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.975
If it gets too bad, then
just walk down right away.

00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:45.520
[gasping]

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.456
<i>It hasn't hit me yet.</i>

00:30:47.958 --> 00:30:49.528
<i>It's scary.</i>

00:30:49.628 --> 00:30:51.632
<i>But the thought of</i>
<i>finding out something bad</i>

00:30:51.732 --> 00:30:55.940
<i>after it's too late and</i>
<i>regretting it, is even scarier.</i>

00:30:59.347 --> 00:31:01.084
[cough]

00:31:04.625 --> 00:31:06.261
[gasp]

00:31:10.603 --> 00:31:12.173
[Riko groans]

00:31:13.475 --> 00:31:14.945
What?

00:31:20.523 --> 00:31:22.861
It doesn't hurt.

00:31:24.732 --> 00:31:26.401
[gasp]

00:31:27.103 --> 00:31:30.175
<i>What's going on?</i>

00:31:30.744 --> 00:31:31.846
<i>That's right.</i>

00:31:31.946 --> 00:31:34.383
<i>I've got to squat down.</i>

00:31:35.152 --> 00:31:38.893
<i>But which way is the ground?</i>

00:31:39.661 --> 00:31:41.665
<i>I can't hear my voice.</i>

00:31:42.534 --> 00:31:45.974
<i>I can't feel myself.</i>

00:31:46.074 --> 00:31:50.583
<i>What's happening to</i>
<i>the shape of my body?</i>

00:31:50.683 --> 00:31:53.054
<i>Is my face supposed to...</i>

00:31:53.155 --> 00:31:55.960
<i>Where is my face?</i>

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:58.866
<i>Where, where is my...</i>

00:31:58.966 --> 00:32:02.406
<i>Where is where again?</i>

00:32:03.241 --> 00:32:05.880
[Prushka] Riko! Riko!

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.584
[gasp]

00:32:08.853 --> 00:32:10.990
Oh, you're okay now.

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:12.861
Hey, Prushka.

00:32:12.961 --> 00:32:14.330
[Riko groans]

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:16.535
Your sense of pain
is returning.

00:32:16.635 --> 00:32:18.205
Let me see your face.

00:32:19.073 --> 00:32:21.411
Whoa, you hurt
yourself pretty bad.

00:32:21.512 --> 00:32:24.852
I suddenly felt sharp
things pressed against me.

00:32:24.952 --> 00:32:27.223
You fell down face
first, you know?

00:32:27.323 --> 00:32:28.425
Huh?

00:32:28.526 --> 00:32:29.628
The fifth layer's curse

00:32:29.728 --> 00:32:30.897
can take away both your sense

00:32:30.997 --> 00:32:33.335
of touch and your sense of
balance.

00:32:34.036 --> 00:32:35.607
Open your mouth.

00:32:36.374 --> 00:32:37.276
Ah.

00:32:37.376 --> 00:32:39.581
Your molars got all
messed up, huh?

00:32:40.817 --> 00:32:43.288
When you're not experiencing
the right amount of sensation,

00:32:43.388 --> 00:32:45.359
something as simple
as gritting your teeth

00:32:45.459 --> 00:32:47.998
can make you chip them
really easily.

00:32:48.098 --> 00:32:51.204
Ah, the cracked ones are
just some baby teeth.

00:32:51.304 --> 00:32:54.511
Luckily, you'll have some
new ones coming in real soon.

00:32:57.617 --> 00:32:58.719
There.

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.255
Thanks a lot.

00:33:00.355 --> 00:33:02.126
Where were you anyway, Prushka?

00:33:02.226 --> 00:33:03.495
I was in my room.

00:33:03.596 --> 00:33:06.034
I woke up whenever
I heard you screaming.

00:33:06.134 --> 00:33:08.639
But all the doors were
locked, weren't they?

00:33:08.739 --> 00:33:11.579
Oh, come on, Riko. We all
look our doors at night.

00:33:11.679 --> 00:33:13.583
I mean, I know mine sure was.

00:33:13.683 --> 00:33:17.456
I am at that age. I've
got my reasons, Riko.

00:33:18.058 --> 00:33:19.528
You know what?

00:33:19.628 --> 00:33:21.264
The truth is...

00:33:22.567 --> 00:33:25.005
[panting]

00:33:31.886 --> 00:33:33.154
[footsteps]

00:33:33.255 --> 00:33:34.357
[Riko] How'd it go?

00:33:34.457 --> 00:33:36.094
You're totally right,
it's strange.

00:33:36.194 --> 00:33:37.964
Every single door was locked.

00:33:38.064 --> 00:33:40.168
First time I've seen that.

00:33:40.269 --> 00:33:43.709
Um, which means that this
is the only way left.

00:33:43.809 --> 00:33:45.713
But Reg...

00:33:45.813 --> 00:33:47.584
And Nanachi.

00:33:47.684 --> 00:33:49.153
Right. We'll go together.

00:33:49.253 --> 00:33:52.561
-Huh? But I-
-It'll be fine.

00:33:53.696 --> 00:33:55.399
Meinya, wake up.

00:33:56.969 --> 00:33:57.904
[Meinya mews]

00:33:58.004 --> 00:33:59.373
Oh!

00:33:59.473 --> 00:34:02.012
Right. Okay,
so this is Meinya.

00:34:02.112 --> 00:34:04.518
Papa gave Meinya to me
on my 10th birthday.

00:34:04.618 --> 00:34:07.022
Come on now.
Say hello to Riko for me.

00:34:07.122 --> 00:34:09.026
[mew]

00:34:09.728 --> 00:34:11.665
Okay. You're going first.

00:34:14.103 --> 00:34:16.241
[Riko] Will Meinya be okay?

00:34:16.341 --> 00:34:18.278
Meinya's eyes and
legs are very sensitive

00:34:18.378 --> 00:34:20.850
and can pick up different
things than we can.

00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:22.319
You know what?

00:34:22.419 --> 00:34:24.625
They say that the only senses
the fifth layer's curse

00:34:24.725 --> 00:34:27.463
can take away are those
possessed by humans?

00:34:27.564 --> 00:34:29.033
Oh...

00:34:29.133 --> 00:34:31.237
Just leave it to me.
There's a trick to this.

00:34:31.337 --> 00:34:33.776
You see, Riko, I've had
lots of secret adventures

00:34:33.876 --> 00:34:35.647
Papa doesn't know about.

00:34:35.747 --> 00:34:37.149
Say, Prushka...

00:34:37.249 --> 00:34:40.022
In your eyes, what kinda
person is your father?

00:34:40.122 --> 00:34:43.161
My Papa's the best ever.
No matter what's going on

00:34:43.261 --> 00:34:45.733
he's always thinking about me.

00:34:45.833 --> 00:34:48.639
[Nanachi] I never imagined
you had a daughter.

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:52.647
[Bondrewd] Our blood
relationship is weak,
but it's true.

00:34:52.747 --> 00:34:54.150
Adorable, yes?

00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:56.755
[Nanachi] So she's not
directly descended from you?

00:34:56.855 --> 00:34:59.628
I guess it's not like you
could start a family, huh?

00:34:59.728 --> 00:35:02.433
[Bondrewd] Is what they call
"family" restricted merely

00:35:02.534 --> 00:35:04.805
to those related by blood?

00:35:04.905 --> 00:35:07.376
I do not believe
that to be so.

00:35:07.476 --> 00:35:10.883
Families are built by
strangers who cross paths

00:35:10.984 --> 00:35:12.086
and come together.

00:35:12.186 --> 00:35:14.323
Having souls that
love each other

00:35:14.423 --> 00:35:16.427
is what makes people family.

00:35:16.528 --> 00:35:19.266
Love just helps in that regard.

00:35:19.868 --> 00:35:21.037
Love.

00:35:21.137 --> 00:35:23.643
It's a matter of love, Nanachi.

00:35:23.743 --> 00:35:25.078
"Love," you say?

00:35:25.178 --> 00:35:27.817
You've got some nerve to
spew such grand concepts

00:35:27.917 --> 00:35:29.387
from such a narrow opening.

00:35:29.487 --> 00:35:32.694
[Bondrewd] Your verbal barbs
are so unique and precious.

00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:34.196
[sniffing]

00:35:34.296 --> 00:35:36.735
Yeah. That's it,
take a big deep whiff.

00:35:36.835 --> 00:35:39.708
You're new at this, just keep
your eyes closed and focus.

00:35:39.808 --> 00:35:41.411
You can do it.

00:35:41.512 --> 00:35:43.783
Even if you lose all
your other senses,

00:35:43.883 --> 00:35:47.557
you can still see the waves
Meinya puts out in front of us.

00:35:48.458 --> 00:35:49.961
So?

00:35:50.062 --> 00:35:52.199
[Riko] Yes. I can see them.

00:35:52.299 --> 00:35:55.238
Take your time and start
moving towards them.

00:35:59.146 --> 00:36:00.248
Very good.

00:36:00.349 --> 00:36:02.186
Keep going very slowly.

00:36:02.286 --> 00:36:03.756
[Meinya mews]

00:36:03.856 --> 00:36:05.258
Just like that, Riko.

00:36:06.762 --> 00:36:08.131
[Bondrewd] At long last,

00:36:08.231 --> 00:36:10.636
the research is entering
its final stage.

00:36:10.737 --> 00:36:12.039
[gasp]

00:36:12.139 --> 00:36:14.343
Please, I ask you to
come back and join me.

00:36:14.443 --> 00:36:18.485
There are so many things I
would like for you to see.

00:36:20.623 --> 00:36:21.892
[Nanachi sighs]

00:36:24.397 --> 00:36:26.802
Uh... Listen, Bondrewd.

00:36:30.743 --> 00:36:33.314
So here's the deal.

00:36:37.122 --> 00:36:42.166
Fine then, I will come back
and work with you again. Okay?

00:36:42.266 --> 00:36:44.403
That is positively
delightful to hear.

00:36:44.504 --> 00:36:48.411
Nanachi, you are very
special, you know that, right?

00:36:48.512 --> 00:36:49.981
[Nanachi] I have
some conditions.

00:36:50.082 --> 00:36:52.252
Oh? What might they be?

00:36:52.352 --> 00:36:53.488
My two friends.

00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:56.227
Can you please promise
not to hurt them?

00:36:56.327 --> 00:36:59.935
And help them. Help them get
down to the sixth layer?

00:37:00.035 --> 00:37:01.672
Uh-oh.

00:37:01.772 --> 00:37:05.045
It seems I may have done
something regretful.

00:37:05.145 --> 00:37:06.648
That boy type Aubade

00:37:06.749 --> 00:37:10.222
is a truly unprecedented
specimen, you know?

00:37:10.322 --> 00:37:11.959
It is already underway.

00:37:12.059 --> 00:37:13.529
[Nanachi gasps]

00:37:14.965 --> 00:37:17.804
[metallic clanking]

00:37:17.904 --> 00:37:20.475
-[Umbra Hand 1] It wakes.
-[Umbra Hand 2] It wakes.

00:37:20.576 --> 00:37:22.981
[Umbra Hand 1] It's meridians
are also similar.

00:37:23.081 --> 00:37:24.016
[Umbra Hand 2] Very similar.

00:37:24.116 --> 00:37:25.720
[Reg] <i>What are they saying?</i>

00:37:26.822 --> 00:37:28.224
<i>I can't move.</i>

00:37:28.324 --> 00:37:29.995
<i>I can't speak either.</i>

00:37:30.095 --> 00:37:32.934
-Must see inside.
-Must see within.

00:37:33.034 --> 00:37:34.571
-Must see.

00:37:35.272 --> 00:37:37.777
[Reg panting]

00:37:39.447 --> 00:37:42.019
[Hand 2] Negative.
Metal is not strong enough.

00:37:42.119 --> 00:37:45.025
[Hand 1] The light.
[Hand 3] We shall use the light.

00:37:45.125 --> 00:37:46.494
<i>Damn it. What is this?</i>

00:37:46.595 --> 00:37:48.732
-[charging sound]
<i>-What are they doing?</i>

00:37:48.833 --> 00:37:50.970
[Reg screams]

00:37:52.339 --> 00:37:55.613
-Removed.
-Removed.

00:37:57.249 --> 00:37:59.019
[clicking]

00:37:59.921 --> 00:38:01.959
<i>My, my arm.</i>

00:38:04.998 --> 00:38:06.802
Urine is also similar.

00:38:06.902 --> 00:38:08.606
The composition unknown.

00:38:08.706 --> 00:38:10.643
Sufficient volume of
fluid has been collected

00:38:10.743 --> 00:38:13.749
-from the opening.
-Sufficient.

00:38:13.849 --> 00:38:16.087
It is even reproducing the
sensation of exceeding pain.

00:38:16.187 --> 00:38:18.291
-Reason is unknown.
-Unknown.

00:38:18.391 --> 00:38:19.460
Unknown.

00:38:19.561 --> 00:38:21.297
Must see the abdomen.

00:38:21.397 --> 00:38:24.436
-The abdomen.
-Also a leg.

00:38:29.346 --> 00:38:30.983
[Reg screams in pain]

00:38:31.083 --> 00:38:33.656
[Nanachi yells]

00:38:35.893 --> 00:38:36.929
Reg!

00:38:37.864 --> 00:38:39.333
Reg!

00:38:43.976 --> 00:38:46.080
Damn it. Talk to me, Reg.

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:49.253
[Umbra Hands murmuring]
The Blessed.

00:38:49.353 --> 00:38:51.725
-The Blessed.
-The Blessed.

00:38:51.825 --> 00:38:53.596
The Blessed.

00:38:53.696 --> 00:38:54.731
Stop it.

00:38:54.831 --> 00:38:55.933
Don't touch me!

00:38:56.033 --> 00:38:57.871
[Nanachi yells]

00:38:57.971 --> 00:39:01.344
[Meinya screeches]

00:39:04.784 --> 00:39:07.456
[Prushka]
What's going on here?

00:39:08.091 --> 00:39:09.561
Stop that, all of you.

00:39:09.661 --> 00:39:13.434
I told you, all these kids
are guests of my papa.

00:39:13.536 --> 00:39:15.540
Reg and Nanachi!

00:39:17.242 --> 00:39:18.679
Huh?

00:39:19.881 --> 00:39:22.720
Riko, we have got to
get out of here.

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:24.356
[Riko] Reg?

00:39:26.127 --> 00:39:27.396
Oh, God.

00:39:27.931 --> 00:39:29.199
Oh, God.

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.204
Ri...ko.

00:39:31.304 --> 00:39:33.041
[Riko] Reg!

00:39:33.141 --> 00:39:34.811
Unacceptable!

00:39:34.911 --> 00:39:37.349
What's going on?
What's the meaning of this?

00:39:37.449 --> 00:39:39.688
I'm gonna tell Papa on
each and every one of you.

00:39:39.788 --> 00:39:41.625
[Hand 1] That is
a dangerous relic.

00:39:41.725 --> 00:39:44.531
[Hand 2] If we had not induced
it into lowering its guard,

00:39:44.631 --> 00:39:46.735
we could not have captured it.

00:39:46.835 --> 00:39:50.910
Wait, was this
on Papa's orders?

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:54.651
But there's no way Papa
would do something so awful.

00:39:54.751 --> 00:39:57.389
You must not come in here.

00:39:57.489 --> 00:40:00.462
Did the Sovereign
not tell you as much?

00:40:00.563 --> 00:40:03.201
Now, this way, please.

00:40:03.301 --> 00:40:05.438
-This way, please.
-This way, please.

00:40:05.539 --> 00:40:08.211
-This way, please.
-this way, please.

00:40:08.311 --> 00:40:09.848
This way please.

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.524
Please this way.

00:40:19.233 --> 00:40:20.435
Riko?

00:40:20.536 --> 00:40:23.007
[Riko and Prushka yelling]

00:40:25.078 --> 00:40:27.482
[grinding stone]

00:40:31.792 --> 00:40:33.361
Reg, Reg!

00:40:33.461 --> 00:40:35.332
Nanachi, what happened?

00:40:35.432 --> 00:40:37.704
It looks like he passed out.

00:40:39.139 --> 00:40:41.812
Riko, we're gonna take
refuge outside for now.

00:40:41.912 --> 00:40:44.684
They were probably planning to
do this from the very start.

00:40:44.784 --> 00:40:47.523
Yes. But Reg's arm is
still inside, though.

00:40:47.624 --> 00:40:49.493
We're definitely
getting it back.

00:40:49.594 --> 00:40:51.497
Most definitely.

00:40:53.368 --> 00:40:54.938
[Nanachi] Sure
you're okay with this?

00:40:55.038 --> 00:40:57.810
[Prushka] I'll tell Papa
about the boat later.

00:40:58.612 --> 00:41:00.716
And well, I'm really sorry

00:41:00.816 --> 00:41:02.520
about what they did
to your friend.

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:03.889
[Meinya mews softly]

00:41:03.989 --> 00:41:04.958
Prushka...

00:41:05.058 --> 00:41:07.195
You, you don't know
what they'll do to you

00:41:07.295 --> 00:41:09.033
if you go back there.

00:41:09.133 --> 00:41:12.740
It's true that they were
acting strange today.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.778
But my Papa, he understands me.

00:41:14.878 --> 00:41:18.786
I'll ask him to
return Reg's arm.

00:41:19.721 --> 00:41:22.326
I'm really sorry.
I know that...

00:41:22.426 --> 00:41:25.866
I know I don't have any
right to say this, but...

00:41:25.966 --> 00:41:29.373
But when Reg gets himself
all fixed up, I mean,

00:41:29.473 --> 00:41:32.045
if everything turns out okay,

00:41:32.145 --> 00:41:34.517
I was wondering...

00:41:36.253 --> 00:41:37.724
Nevermind.

00:41:37.824 --> 00:41:39.193
I shouldn't keep you.

00:41:39.293 --> 00:41:40.896
Please go.

00:41:41.531 --> 00:41:43.936
[engine starts]

00:41:55.458 --> 00:41:56.928
[Prushka] Riko!

00:41:57.029 --> 00:42:00.836
Riko! I wanna go on
adventures with you!

00:42:07.617 --> 00:42:10.088
[footsteps]

00:42:12.259 --> 00:42:13.729
Papa...

00:42:15.298 --> 00:42:16.467
Papa!

00:42:16.568 --> 00:42:17.737
Listen, Riko and
the others are--

00:42:17.837 --> 00:42:18.906
[Bondrewd] Prushka...

00:42:19.006 --> 00:42:22.345
You will soon be a
full grown lady.

00:42:22.446 --> 00:42:27.557
So please confirm the situation
with your own eyes and ears.

00:42:27.657 --> 00:42:31.063
This Umbra Hand is
one who can be trusted

00:42:31.163 --> 00:42:34.303
and he will protect you
while you're outside.

00:42:47.663 --> 00:42:49.734
[Nanachi] I can't
take this anymore.

00:42:49.834 --> 00:42:52.774
We can't let that monster
who brought so much suffering

00:42:52.874 --> 00:42:55.679
to Mitty and now Reg keep
getting away with it.

00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:58.418
I am certain that he's
going to be coming after us.

00:42:58.519 --> 00:43:01.023
Don't know how we can
pull it off, though.

00:43:01.123 --> 00:43:02.058
[Riko sobbing]

00:43:02.159 --> 00:43:02.927
Reg.

00:43:03.027 --> 00:43:05.298
-Como on Reg, please.
-Riko...

00:43:05.398 --> 00:43:08.204
[Riko crying]

00:43:12.547 --> 00:43:14.149
There, there.

00:43:14.249 --> 00:43:16.020
You've held up well.

00:43:17.255 --> 00:43:19.594
[Reg] Riko? Nanachi?

00:43:21.096 --> 00:43:22.600
[Riko] Reg!

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:25.639
I think I can smell
Netherworld's stew.

00:43:25.739 --> 00:43:27.375
The burnt parts, anyway.

00:43:27.476 --> 00:43:30.281
Ah, what are you
talking about, Reg?

00:43:30.381 --> 00:43:31.918
You smell it?

00:43:33.087 --> 00:43:36.260
This is the fifth
layer's sandstone region.

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:37.997
So then perhaps...

00:43:39.701 --> 00:43:42.005
[footsteps]

00:43:55.064 --> 00:43:58.404
Nanachi, please.
There's no need to sulk.

00:43:58.505 --> 00:44:00.275
I heard from Prushka.

00:44:00.375 --> 00:44:03.882
Your friend is a very
important doll to you, yes?

00:44:03.982 --> 00:44:06.855
I cannot return him to
his original condition,

00:44:06.955 --> 00:44:08.859
but I can repair him.

00:44:08.959 --> 00:44:12.199
Now then, let us all
head back together.

00:44:12.299 --> 00:44:13.769
That is not gonna happen.

00:44:13.869 --> 00:44:15.471
I will not let you go back.

00:44:15.573 --> 00:44:16.473
[Blaze Reap clicks]

00:44:16.575 --> 00:44:18.044
Hm?

00:44:20.749 --> 00:44:22.920
[Riko yells]

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:25.659
[Bondrewd] That belongs to the
Sovereign of Annihilation.

00:44:25.759 --> 00:44:29.266
It's dangerous.
Evacuate, Nanachi.

00:44:29.366 --> 00:44:31.771
You know what? You shouldn't
just stare at the holes.

00:44:31.872 --> 00:44:34.911
You really ought to look
down at your feet a bit more.

00:44:37.415 --> 00:44:40.288
[Narrator] <i>In the sandstone</i>
<i>region of the sea of corpses</i>

00:44:40.388 --> 00:44:41.858
<i>in the fifth layer,</i>

00:44:41.958 --> 00:44:45.431
<i>there's a distinct odor that</i>
<i>lingers near their nests.</i>

00:44:45.533 --> 00:44:48.371
<i>Those who have not created</i>
<i>any vomit smoke signals</i>

00:44:48.471 --> 00:44:52.045

00:44:52.145 --> 00:44:55.251
<i>Seven-tailed</i>
<i>ferocious arachnids.</i>

00:44:55.351 --> 00:44:58.057
<i>The ultimate predators</i>

00:44:58.157 --> 00:45:02.065
<i>A massive colony</i>

00:45:02.165 --> 00:45:04.938
[Riko panting]

00:45:08.411 --> 00:45:10.014
[Riko] Reg! Nanachi!

00:45:10.114 --> 00:45:11.918
[Reg] Riko, you all right?

00:45:12.018 --> 00:45:13.487
[affirmative grunt]

00:45:13.589 --> 00:45:14.891
Are the two of you okay?

00:45:14.991 --> 00:45:17.863
Yes. I'm used to the fifth
layer strains after all.

00:45:17.964 --> 00:45:19.701
If you adjust to the
eye of the force field,

00:45:19.801 --> 00:45:21.671
you won't lose
consciousness.

00:45:21.771 --> 00:45:23.976
Okay, Reg, how's
your wound doing?

00:45:24.076 --> 00:45:26.715
It isn't really
hurting anymore.

00:45:27.482 --> 00:45:28.752
What's the matter?

00:45:28.852 --> 00:45:31.725
[Reg] But I can feel
my missing fingers.

00:45:31.825 --> 00:45:33.929
[Nanachi] That's what
they call "phantom pain."

00:45:34.029 --> 00:45:37.002
Anyway, Reg, we have got to
get that arm of yours back.

00:45:37.102 --> 00:45:39.540
And that's only one reason
we can't just sit here.

00:45:39.641 --> 00:45:43.147
Okay, you two, time to get
ready for our next operation.

00:45:43.247 --> 00:45:44.182
Wait, Nanachi.

00:45:44.283 --> 00:45:46.855
They're all... they...

00:45:46.955 --> 00:45:49.293
[ominous music]

00:45:50.328 --> 00:45:53.267
That man is a demon.

00:45:54.002 --> 00:45:56.006
[charging up sound]

00:45:57.877 --> 00:46:01.317
-[explosions]
-[stingerheads screeching]

00:46:05.926 --> 00:46:08.197
[Reg] What... What
did he just do?

00:46:08.297 --> 00:46:11.771
[Nanachi] Sparagmos. The
Essence-Returning Light.

00:46:11.871 --> 00:46:13.875
It's one of Bondrewd's weapons.

00:46:13.976 --> 00:46:17.415
It cut off your arm and
scorched off Mitty's eyes.

00:46:18.451 --> 00:46:20.388
[screeching]

00:46:31.377 --> 00:46:33.014
[Riko whimpers]

00:46:33.114 --> 00:46:34.717
[Bondrewd] What's
gotten into you?

00:46:34.817 --> 00:46:37.657
Why are you hiding
in such a place?

00:46:37.757 --> 00:46:40.562
Please, children,
show your faces.

00:46:40.663 --> 00:46:44.403
So he can read the flow
of consciousnesses too?

00:46:44.504 --> 00:46:46.206
No, I don't think so.

00:46:46.307 --> 00:46:49.079
He's using some kind of
trick to try and fool me.

00:46:49.179 --> 00:46:52.687
I'm afraid he might be peeking
in on my sense of sight.

00:46:52.787 --> 00:46:55.391
[Meinya screeches]

00:46:57.062 --> 00:46:59.834
[Prushka] Papa... Riko...

00:46:59.934 --> 00:47:02.105
What am I supposed to do?

00:47:02.205 --> 00:47:03.875
[gasp]

00:47:05.445 --> 00:47:06.681
My goodness.

00:47:06.781 --> 00:47:08.852
Because we were right
on top of a nest,

00:47:08.952 --> 00:47:11.423
I didn't want to provoke
them by calling out,

00:47:11.524 --> 00:47:15.599
but to think you were fully
aware of what you were doing.

00:47:15.699 --> 00:47:16.735
Splendid.

00:47:16.835 --> 00:47:18.805
So you already
knew then, huh?

00:47:18.905 --> 00:47:21.678
Let's see what
else you've got.

00:47:21.778 --> 00:47:23.582
Play it cool this time, Reg.

00:47:29.627 --> 00:47:31.898
[bomb exploding]

00:47:34.537 --> 00:47:35.839
Papa...

00:47:35.939 --> 00:47:37.475
[Bondrewd] A glow stone bomb.

00:47:37.576 --> 00:47:41.016
Coming prepared to detonate
it on top of yourself.

00:47:41.116 --> 00:47:42.920
You are indeed just a boy.

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:45.859
I'm just getting started!

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:52.405
Oh?

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:54.443
[gasp]

00:47:54.544 --> 00:47:59.419
Impressive. You aimed
precisely at a gap in my armor.

00:48:00.021 --> 00:48:02.058
What's this?

00:48:02.158 --> 00:48:04.196
They're amaranthine-deceptor
larvae.

00:48:04.296 --> 00:48:06.433
There's nothing worth a
damn in your head anyway.

00:48:06.534 --> 00:48:07.937
Just let 'em devour it.

00:48:08.037 --> 00:48:09.272
[Bondrewd chuckles]

00:48:09.372 --> 00:48:10.943
How marvelous.

00:48:11.043 --> 00:48:13.548
[Nanachi] <i>He knew nothing</i>
<i>about our conversations.</i>

00:48:13.648 --> 00:48:16.855
His peeking only let him
know the things that I saw.

00:48:16.955 --> 00:48:18.558
We'll show him some
things we prepared

00:48:18.658 --> 00:48:21.096
and then bombarded him
using different methods.

00:48:21.196 --> 00:48:23.869
Right now he doesn't have
any cartridges on him.

00:48:23.969 --> 00:48:25.506
We won't get this chance again.

00:48:25.606 --> 00:48:26.841
What cartridges?

00:48:26.941 --> 00:48:29.212
Equipment to ward off
the Curse of the Abyss.

00:48:29.312 --> 00:48:33.020
We should settle this quickly
before reinforcements arrive.

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:36.093
[Reg yelling]

00:48:38.364 --> 00:48:41.538
Such wondrous
destructive power.

00:48:41.638 --> 00:48:43.642
I am envious.

00:48:43.742 --> 00:48:45.612
[Reg yells]

00:48:47.616 --> 00:48:49.252
I'm not done yet!

00:48:49.352 --> 00:48:51.591
[Nanachi] We don't know
how many Sparagmos there are.

00:48:51.691 --> 00:48:54.864
Our only option is to make
sure he can't fire it.

00:48:54.964 --> 00:48:56.835
If he were to release
enough heat under water

00:48:56.935 --> 00:48:59.172
to burn everything up,
the water would vaporize

00:48:59.272 --> 00:49:01.678
and there'd be a huge explosion.

00:49:01.778 --> 00:49:03.548
[Bondrewd] Ah, I see.

00:49:03.648 --> 00:49:07.756
You've surprised me. Did you
think of this yourselves?

00:49:07.857 --> 00:49:09.794
Remarkable, marvelous.

00:49:09.894 --> 00:49:12.198
[Nanachi] <i>Now, Reg.</i>

00:49:12.298 --> 00:49:14.469
[Nanachi] Just below the
water is the sixth layer.

00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:17.275
So you should be able to
give him a taste of it.

00:49:17.375 --> 00:49:20.716
[Reg] <i>I know what you did</i>
<i>to Mitty and Nanachi.</i>

00:49:21.718 --> 00:49:23.354
<i>If you like experiments so much</i>

00:49:23.454 --> 00:49:27.295
<i>then see what it feels</i>
<i>like for yourself.</i>

00:49:35.444 --> 00:49:37.516
Mar-velous.

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:43.093
[Bondrewd blabbering]

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:46.534
Mar-belous...

00:49:56.554 --> 00:49:59.760
[Reg] I'll let you live to
take one last breath.

00:49:59.861 --> 00:50:02.265
Just enough to blow
that whistle.

00:50:02.365 --> 00:50:08.879
And we'll be out of here and
we'll go beyond this place.

00:50:08.979 --> 00:50:10.616
Damn it.

00:50:12.653 --> 00:50:15.024
[Bondrewd choking]

00:50:15.124 --> 00:50:17.161
I'm really sorry
about this, Reg.

00:50:17.262 --> 00:50:20.134
I forced this
horrible job on you.

00:50:21.838 --> 00:50:23.340
[Nanachi gasps]

00:50:24.009 --> 00:50:25.311
[Prushka] Papa?

00:50:26.013 --> 00:50:27.917
[soft emotional music]

00:50:28.017 --> 00:50:29.620
Prushka, wait.

00:50:31.724 --> 00:50:32.726
Papa?

00:50:33.695 --> 00:50:36.266
Papa? Answer me.

00:50:38.572 --> 00:50:40.041
Papa?

00:50:41.076 --> 00:50:42.546
Papa, no.

00:50:43.682 --> 00:50:46.955
No. Please wake up.

00:50:47.055 --> 00:50:50.361
[Prushka sobbing]

00:50:56.541 --> 00:50:58.277
I... I, uh...

00:50:58.377 --> 00:51:01.718
<i>Why? I don't understand this.</i>

00:51:01.818 --> 00:51:06.360
Papa? Papa?
I can't lose you.

00:51:10.167 --> 00:51:13.173
Please don't leave me.

00:51:35.351 --> 00:51:37.823
[crunching, ripping sounds]

00:51:42.566 --> 00:51:44.069
[chorus music]

00:51:44.169 --> 00:51:45.706
[gasp]

00:51:45.806 --> 00:51:47.308
Papa!

00:51:47.408 --> 00:51:51.116
Yes, Prushka, it's me.
Your Papa.

00:51:52.251 --> 00:51:55.391
Papa. You came back.

00:51:57.028 --> 00:51:58.598
[Bondrewd] I won't
be going anywhere.

00:51:58.698 --> 00:52:02.873
As long as I have your
love, I am immortal.

00:52:02.973 --> 00:52:04.710
[Prushka gasps]

00:52:06.547 --> 00:52:09.319
You should be dead!
What the hell are you?

00:52:09.419 --> 00:52:12.693
Ah, I have yet
to introduce myself.

00:52:12.793 --> 00:52:16.500
I am Bondrewd,
a cave raider of the Abyss,

00:52:16.601 --> 00:52:19.674
known as the Sovereign of Dawn.

00:52:19.774 --> 00:52:22.378
You are all truly marvelous.

00:52:22.478 --> 00:52:25.451
You brought about a trial
that we have been lacking

00:52:25.552 --> 00:52:28.424
and have guided Prushka
towards completion.

00:52:28.525 --> 00:52:31.664
Trials make love grow stronger.

00:52:31.764 --> 00:52:33.568
Isn't that right, Nanachi?

00:52:33.668 --> 00:52:35.171
[Nanachi growls]

00:52:36.273 --> 00:52:38.143
[Nanachi] Wait!

00:52:39.012 --> 00:52:41.584
[Reg groans]

00:52:41.684 --> 00:52:43.153
Ah, so heroic.

00:52:43.253 --> 00:52:45.124
Simply adorable.

00:52:45.224 --> 00:52:48.631
I would very much want
you two, as well.

00:52:49.499 --> 00:52:51.303
-[Riko screams]
-Riko!

00:52:51.403 --> 00:52:52.840
[Bondrewd] Those are
Shakers that carry

00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:56.547
the strains of the third layer,
but do not be alarmed.

00:52:56.647 --> 00:52:58.985
Your viscera will
merely churn a bit.

00:52:59.085 --> 00:53:01.490
Bastard. What the
hell's going on?

00:53:01.591 --> 00:53:03.595
[Nanachi] Why are
there two of you?

00:53:03.695 --> 00:53:04.764
[Bondrewd] "Two"?

00:53:04.864 --> 00:53:07.936
The Umbra Hands are
all my own self, child.

00:53:08.037 --> 00:53:09.573
[gasp]

00:53:10.609 --> 00:53:14.115
Now, Nanachi, let
us return together.

00:53:14.215 --> 00:53:17.288
Why? Why do you want me?

00:53:17.388 --> 00:53:20.494
The Abyss does more
than simply grant "Curses."

00:53:20.595 --> 00:53:22.699
There's an effect
I was unable to see

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:26.440
because the impact of the
strains were too great.

00:53:26.541 --> 00:53:29.379
I call the phenomenon
the "Blessing,"

00:53:29.479 --> 00:53:32.953
and it is all due to your
deep spiritual connection

00:53:33.053 --> 00:53:34.590
with Mitty.

00:53:35.659 --> 00:53:37.763
Your love and
adoration made it so

00:53:37.863 --> 00:53:41.336
that your body received only
the blessing of the Abyss.

00:53:41.436 --> 00:53:47.181
You are the only successful
example of this love analogy.

00:53:47.281 --> 00:53:48.818
The answer is love.

00:53:48.918 --> 00:53:50.522
[crying]

00:53:50.622 --> 00:53:53.193
What the hell would
you know about it?

00:53:53.293 --> 00:53:55.131
Be calm, child.

00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:57.569
You'll awake dear Prushka.

00:53:57.669 --> 00:54:02.111
My apologies, but I'm
afraid I must take my leave.

00:54:02.211 --> 00:54:04.784
Feel free to come anytime.

00:54:04.884 --> 00:54:07.388
You are always welcome.

00:54:08.925 --> 00:54:13.267
[Nanachi sobs and yells]

00:54:22.719 --> 00:54:27.061
[Bondrewd] Please dispose of
everything marked in crimson.

00:54:27.161 --> 00:54:29.299
[Umbra Hands]
Dispose. Dispose.

00:54:29.399 --> 00:54:30.802
[Prushka] Papa.

00:54:32.773 --> 00:54:33.942
Papa.

00:54:36.714 --> 00:54:38.250
I want to...

00:54:39.085 --> 00:54:41.456
I want to see the dawn.

00:54:41.557 --> 00:54:45.297
[Bondrewd] Yes, we shall
view the dawn together.

00:54:46.099 --> 00:54:48.771
[Prushka groans]

00:54:48.872 --> 00:54:50.609
The two of us, Papa?

00:54:52.278 --> 00:54:55.886
Together on an adventure.

00:54:55.986 --> 00:55:00.327
[Bondrewd] Yes, we shall
be together forever more.

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:04.537
[Prushka] <i>Keep it up.</i>

00:55:04.637 --> 00:55:06.641
<i>Almost there, Riko.</i>

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:13.788
Riko, you could be called
"The Sovereign of Children."

00:55:13.888 --> 00:55:16.259
How about something a little
bit cooler?

00:55:16.359 --> 00:55:18.363
Sovereign of Large
Foreheads and Glasses.

00:55:18.463 --> 00:55:20.501
-Huh?
-[Meinya mews]

00:55:20.602 --> 00:55:22.338
So, what do you wanna
do once you're finally

00:55:22.438 --> 00:55:24.342
a White Whistle, Riko?

00:55:25.645 --> 00:55:28.050
When I started, I thought
I'd become a White Whistle

00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:30.020
because I wanted to go
see my mother.

00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:33.728
But you know now I wonder if
there's more to it than that.

00:55:33.828 --> 00:55:36.399
Even though I now understand
that the one waiting down there

00:55:36.499 --> 00:55:38.303
for me might not actually
be my mother,

00:55:38.403 --> 00:55:40.575
I'm all the more excited.

00:55:40.675 --> 00:55:43.146
I mean, who really
wrote this letter?

00:55:43.247 --> 00:55:46.687
Why does the Curse of the
Abyss exist in the first place?

00:55:46.787 --> 00:55:50.361
And who really made Reg and
why did they do it anyway?

00:55:50.461 --> 00:55:53.066
I mean, his penis even
gets bigger sometimes.

00:55:53.166 --> 00:55:55.070
Um, what's a penis?

00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:57.308
Huh?

00:55:57.408 --> 00:56:00.314
[Riko] It usually looks
kinda like this,

00:56:00.414 --> 00:56:02.920
but whenever Reg sees
boobs or touches Nanachi,

00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:04.924
it sort of changes.

00:56:05.024 --> 00:56:07.829
Oh, that looks like
the thingy Papa has.

00:56:07.930 --> 00:56:10.769
Anyway, my desire to
see my mom now feels

00:56:10.869 --> 00:56:13.608
like it's just become
a reason I give people.

00:56:13.708 --> 00:56:15.712
I feel like now I just
wanna White Whistle

00:56:15.812 --> 00:56:18.283
so I can descend
to the six layer.

00:56:18.383 --> 00:56:19.319
[mewing]

00:56:19.419 --> 00:56:20.655
But you know what?

00:56:20.755 --> 00:56:23.360
There is one thing that
always stays the same.

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:25.331
I wanna keep on having
crazy adventures

00:56:25.431 --> 00:56:27.569
with those two forever and ever.

00:56:27.669 --> 00:56:29.640
Don't tell either of them that.

00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:31.209
It'll sound like I don't
really have any sort

00:56:31.309 --> 00:56:32.980
of real goal in mind.

00:56:33.881 --> 00:56:37.088
-You're amazing, Riko.
-Huh?

00:56:38.490 --> 00:56:39.860
You know what, Riko?

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:41.864
I think it's not so much
that you wanna find your mom,

00:56:41.964 --> 00:56:43.668
but more that you wanna
be just like your mom

00:56:43.768 --> 00:56:45.739
and go on grand
adventures with her.

00:56:45.839 --> 00:56:47.976
It's like you're figuring out
why you're on your journey

00:56:48.076 --> 00:56:49.412
along the way.

00:56:50.815 --> 00:56:53.487
That's it. Getting down
there won't be the end.

00:56:53.588 --> 00:56:55.892
Right? In fact,
it's just beginning.

00:56:55.992 --> 00:56:56.994
Thanks so much, Prushka.

00:56:57.094 --> 00:56:59.767
It looks like
you're feeling better.

00:56:59.867 --> 00:57:02.940
I can't wait to see my
friends and talk to them.

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:05.645
[Prushka] Hey, Riko,
that friend of yours, Reg,

00:57:05.745 --> 00:57:09.152
is more amazing than even
Papa's special-grade relics.

00:57:09.252 --> 00:57:10.522
And so, you know what?

00:57:10.622 --> 00:57:12.291
I bet you'll be the very
first White Whistle,

00:57:12.391 --> 00:57:13.928
armed with an Aubade.

00:57:14.028 --> 00:57:17.068
Keep on going, Riko.
Just take your time.

00:57:17.168 --> 00:57:18.504
Take it easy.

00:57:18.605 --> 00:57:19.974
And don't look back.

00:57:20.074 --> 00:57:23.514
No matter how dark the darkness
of the Netherworld gets,

00:57:23.615 --> 00:57:25.050
you'll be fine.

00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:26.921
You're very bright, after all.

00:57:27.021 --> 00:57:30.394
A flower of dawn wilts and
falls in the afternoon,

00:57:30.494 --> 00:57:32.599
but you must push forward.

00:57:33.433 --> 00:57:35.572
You know, Riko? I gotta say,

00:57:35.672 --> 00:57:40.047
I've always wanted to have a
wonderful friend just like you.

00:57:40.147 --> 00:57:42.686
[emotional music]

00:57:45.057 --> 00:57:46.059
Riko...

00:57:46.159 --> 00:57:49.933
I wanna go on exciting
adventures with you.

00:57:50.034 --> 00:57:51.504
[Riko] No, Prushka.

00:57:51.604 --> 00:57:53.073
No, no!

00:57:53.173 --> 00:57:55.144
[crash]

00:57:55.244 --> 00:57:57.549
Don't go!

00:57:57.649 --> 00:57:59.419
-Prushka, no!
-Riko!

00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:02.191
-You can't be moving around!
-[Riko groans]

00:58:02.291 --> 00:58:04.563
You have suffered
internal injuries.

00:58:05.431 --> 00:58:07.134
[Reg] <i>What do I do now?</i>

00:58:07.234 --> 00:58:09.740
<i>Even Nanachi is distraught.</i>

00:58:11.811 --> 00:58:14.382
<i>And what the hell was</i>
<i>that monster anyway?</i>

00:58:14.482 --> 00:58:15.985
<i>Once he transferred</i>
<i>to that other body,</i>

00:58:16.086 --> 00:58:19.125
<i>I couldn't keep up with</i>
<i>his movements at all.</i>

00:58:19.225 --> 00:58:20.562
[Riko] Not yet.

00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:24.903
-Riko?
-We can't, we can't give up.

00:58:25.004 --> 00:58:27.174
There must be something in
the Catalog of Relics.

00:58:27.274 --> 00:58:29.379
Hey, what's with her?

00:58:29.479 --> 00:58:32.819
Riko has the Catalog of
Relics practically memorized.

00:58:32.919 --> 00:58:34.857
If his relics are
listed in there,

00:58:34.957 --> 00:58:37.863
we might find some kind
of clue how to defeat him.

00:58:37.963 --> 00:58:41.336
Take a look at his
discarded remains.

00:58:41.436 --> 00:58:44.142
All the parts of the
head are still there.

00:58:44.242 --> 00:58:46.312
Only the mask was taken.

00:58:46.413 --> 00:58:49.686
So then he didn't
swap out heads?

00:58:49.787 --> 00:58:51.991
-That's Zoaholic.
-It's what?

00:58:52.091 --> 00:58:55.532
It's Zoaholic, Reg!
The soul slave machine.

00:58:55.632 --> 00:58:57.936
It's a relic that can
transplant your consciousness

00:58:58.036 --> 00:58:59.138
into someone else.

00:58:59.238 --> 00:59:01.376
But when you mix in or
increase your consciousness,

00:59:01.476 --> 00:59:03.548
the people you're using
start to go insane.

00:59:03.648 --> 00:59:05.819
It's a special-grade
relic that 15 years ago

00:59:05.919 --> 00:59:08.356
started being considered
lost to the Abyss.

00:59:08.457 --> 00:59:09.927
White Whistles are
supposed to only have up

00:59:10.027 --> 00:59:11.997
to grade-1 relics, but
then I remembered something

00:59:12.098 --> 00:59:13.668
that Prushka said.

00:59:13.768 --> 00:59:15.972
[Reg] So that's
what the mask is?

00:59:16.072 --> 00:59:17.007
Mm-mm

00:59:17.108 --> 00:59:19.178
The Zoaholic is the
size of a large room

00:59:19.278 --> 00:59:21.216
and shaped kinda like a butt.

00:59:22.218 --> 00:59:23.755
Maybe I'm wrong.

00:59:24.623 --> 00:59:26.092
Do you remember
what the Umbra Hand

00:59:26.192 --> 00:59:29.132
from the Garden of the
Flowers of Fortitude told us?

00:59:29.232 --> 00:59:31.369
The person you speak of
is not currently present.

00:59:31.469 --> 00:59:34.977
The method for straddling
layers is prone to difficulties.

00:59:35.077 --> 00:59:38.216
In that case, could he
transfer his consciousness

00:59:38.316 --> 00:59:39.352
without the mask?

00:59:39.452 --> 00:59:40.755
I think he would
probably go insane

00:59:40.855 --> 00:59:43.026
if he straddled the
force field too much.

00:59:43.126 --> 00:59:45.164
Perhaps the mask
is just a symbol,

00:59:45.264 --> 00:59:48.938
the identity of the Sovereign
of Dawn, Bondrewd "The Novel."

00:59:49.038 --> 00:59:51.443
It would also serve to
impress upon Prushka

00:59:51.544 --> 00:59:53.548
who her father is.

00:59:53.648 --> 00:59:56.319
But anyway, "Zoaholic," was it?

00:59:56.419 --> 00:59:57.956
It's super fishy.

00:59:58.056 --> 01:00:01.664
It's the kind of thing that
sicko would undoubtedly love.

01:00:02.164 --> 01:00:03.400
[chuckle]

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:06.239
That's our Nanachi!
Brains of the team!

01:00:06.339 --> 01:00:07.876
[Nanachi groans]

01:00:08.811 --> 01:00:10.147
I could be wrong, you know?

01:00:10.247 --> 01:00:12.552
Yeah. But it's worth
looking into, isn't it?

01:00:12.652 --> 01:00:14.188
Yeah.

01:00:14.288 --> 01:00:16.092
Okay. Okay.

01:00:16.192 --> 01:00:17.662
I suppose you're right.

01:00:17.762 --> 01:00:20.167
<i>If I were to give</i>
<i>up before these two,</i>

01:00:20.267 --> 01:00:24.576
<i>there's no way I'd be able to</i>
<i>show my face to Mitty again.</i>

01:00:24.676 --> 01:00:27.448
All right. If we can
destroy that Zoaholic thing,

01:00:27.549 --> 01:00:29.452
then it should really
shake him up.

01:00:29.553 --> 01:00:31.122
I say we do this, you two.

01:00:31.222 --> 01:00:34.428
There's no way I can let
things end like this.

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:37.101
We will take back our adventure!

01:00:38.303 --> 01:00:40.608
[Riko] Reg's energy source
is electricity, you know?

01:00:40.708 --> 01:00:41.744
When he showed up in Orth,

01:00:41.844 --> 01:00:43.815
we used electricity
to revive him.

01:00:43.915 --> 01:00:46.052
But well, that might
have also been the reason

01:00:46.152 --> 01:00:48.858
Reg lost all his
memories as well.

01:00:48.958 --> 01:00:51.797
What if he ends up forgetting
who we are in the process?

01:00:51.897 --> 01:00:54.502
So, Riko, if we're
going to take him on,

01:00:54.603 --> 01:00:56.005
we'll need the Incinerator.

01:00:56.105 --> 01:00:57.642
The 10 minutes before I pass out

01:00:57.742 --> 01:00:59.847
after I fire the first
shot is critical.

01:00:59.947 --> 01:01:02.819
Everything depends on how
many shots I can hit him with.

01:01:02.919 --> 01:01:04.523
And don't you worry.

01:01:04.623 --> 01:01:07.328
I promise I will
never forget about you.

01:01:09.265 --> 01:01:11.670
Reg, you're the best!

01:01:12.772 --> 01:01:14.676
Oh, brother. Listen here.

01:01:14.776 --> 01:01:17.214
Ido Front gets its
electricity from a whirlpool.

01:01:17.314 --> 01:01:20.020
The amount of power is nothing
compared to the cities,

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:22.358
but we can count on
him recovering.

01:01:22.458 --> 01:01:25.899
Well, at least I'd
like to believe.

01:01:25.999 --> 01:01:27.802
Reg you alone will
sneak into the place

01:01:27.903 --> 01:01:29.405
that houses the power source.

01:01:29.506 --> 01:01:31.009
Riko and I will
buy you some time.

01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:34.181
The whirlpool is located in
the interior of Ido Front.

01:01:34.282 --> 01:01:37.756
So you won't have to worry
about being sucked in. But...

01:01:37.856 --> 01:01:39.425
[Reg] <i>Sun Sphere!</i>

01:01:40.193 --> 01:01:42.097
[creature roars]

01:01:51.282 --> 01:01:54.422
[energetic music]

01:02:06.947 --> 01:02:10.020
[Umbra Hand] Right
this way, this way.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:14.028
Good grief. Just how many
of these things are there?

01:02:21.442 --> 01:02:23.915
What am I supposed to do now?

01:02:29.225 --> 01:02:31.095
[Reg grunts]

01:02:34.201 --> 01:02:36.774
-[Riko] Hey, Nanachi?
-[Nanachi] Yeah?

01:02:36.874 --> 01:02:38.544
The Sovereign of Dawn's
white whistle...

01:02:38.644 --> 01:02:39.980
How is he able to use it?

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:43.320
Only the original owner
should be able to-

01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:45.525
[both gasping]

01:02:45.625 --> 01:02:48.163
[electricity buzzing]

01:02:48.263 --> 01:02:48.864
Reg...

01:02:48.965 --> 01:02:50.902
I think he did it.

01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:54.375
[suspenseful music]

01:03:09.973 --> 01:03:11.777
[distorted voice]
Where is here?

01:03:11.877 --> 01:03:13.446
Where am I?

01:03:13.547 --> 01:03:16.954
-[Hand 1] What happened here?
-[Hand 2] Who are you?

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:27.709
Where to? Where? Where?

01:03:27.809 --> 01:03:29.245
Where to?

01:03:29.345 --> 01:03:33.253
Well, peeking in on my
vision won't do much for him

01:03:33.353 --> 01:03:34.355
when it's this dark.

01:03:34.455 --> 01:03:37.595
Nanachi, Reg doesn't
seem to be responding.

01:03:37.696 --> 01:03:38.931
[roof rumbling]

01:03:39.031 --> 01:03:40.802
What the heck do
you think that was?

01:03:40.902 --> 01:03:43.006
It's gotta be Reg!
Since the comm isn't working,

01:03:43.106 --> 01:03:44.910
he's shaking things up
to send us a signal.

01:03:45.010 --> 01:03:47.381
You sure are an optimist,
aren't you?

01:03:47.481 --> 01:03:50.722
Anyway we need to get
moving and find Prushka.

01:03:50.822 --> 01:03:53.293
[Riko winces]

01:03:53.393 --> 01:03:54.563
[mewing]

01:03:54.663 --> 01:03:57.702
Hey, wait. That little
thing was with Prushka.

01:03:57.802 --> 01:04:00.474
Hm? Meinya!

01:04:00.575 --> 01:04:01.944
You came to find us.

01:04:02.044 --> 01:04:03.413
[sniffing]

01:04:03.514 --> 01:04:04.649
You smell like Prushka.

01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:06.452
[Meinya mews]

01:04:07.388 --> 01:04:08.891
Meinya!

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:11.329
Hey!

01:04:15.103 --> 01:04:17.942
-Meinya! Meinya!
-Riko...

01:04:18.043 --> 01:04:21.115
I'm pretty sure Meinya
wants us to follow along.

01:04:21.215 --> 01:04:23.554
What are you talking about?

01:04:28.363 --> 01:04:32.137
That is the right way.
Okay, fine.

01:04:36.446 --> 01:04:39.385
[Meinya whining]

01:04:42.792 --> 01:04:44.563
What do you think?

01:04:47.702 --> 01:04:50.107
[Riko grunting]

01:04:58.858 --> 01:05:00.661
[mewing]

01:05:00.762 --> 01:05:01.964
What is this?

01:05:02.064 --> 01:05:04.335
[Nanachi] It's the
processing area.

01:05:05.370 --> 01:05:06.139
Processing?

01:05:06.239 --> 01:05:08.376
-Of people.
-Huh?

01:05:08.476 --> 01:05:11.082
They chose kids who
won't be missed from slums

01:05:11.182 --> 01:05:14.321
or those given up to reduce
the number of mouths to feed.

01:05:14.422 --> 01:05:18.062
The stuff inside their heads
and on down their spinal cords.

01:05:18.163 --> 01:05:20.200
Plus enough guts to
keep living a few days

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:24.008
until their expiration date.
That's all they leave of them.

01:05:24.108 --> 01:05:27.916
Everything else gets scraped
off while they're still alive.

01:05:28.016 --> 01:05:30.521
Any sensory organ that
might hamper the curse

01:05:30.621 --> 01:05:32.191
gets chopped off.

01:05:32.291 --> 01:05:35.030
The small thing that's left
after everything else is removed

01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:37.401
is wrapped in flesh
and skin again,

01:05:37.501 --> 01:05:41.643
then stuffed in this container
as a substitute for bones.

01:05:41.743 --> 01:05:44.716
Drugs are used to manipulate
both their ecstasy and fear,

01:05:44.816 --> 01:05:47.454
but they continue to suffer
as fleshy Curse-repellent

01:05:47.555 --> 01:05:48.958
till they die.

01:05:49.058 --> 01:05:51.697
Ultimately, they are what
came out of the experiments

01:05:51.797 --> 01:05:53.199
Mitty and I suffered through.

01:05:53.299 --> 01:05:56.472
That's the truth behind
what he calls "cartridges."

01:05:56.573 --> 01:05:57.609
Nanachi...

01:05:57.709 --> 01:06:01.382
I was always absolutely
terrified of that man.

01:06:01.482 --> 01:06:04.421
I gave into my fear
and helped him create

01:06:04.523 --> 01:06:05.892
these awful things.

01:06:05.992 --> 01:06:08.196
The hands of the kids
who just that day

01:06:08.296 --> 01:06:12.505
have been giddily telling me
how cute and adorable I was.

01:06:12.605 --> 01:06:15.945
Their eyes once filled
with admiration and wonder

01:06:16.045 --> 01:06:20.086
for the Abyss, their chins
as they groaned in pain.

01:06:20.187 --> 01:06:24.328
We carefully removed each
part and discarded them.

01:06:24.428 --> 01:06:27.434
Pretending not to
think anything was wrong!

01:06:27.535 --> 01:06:30.240
With my hands, I ruined
so many people!

01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:33.647
[Nanachi sobbing]

01:06:34.415 --> 01:06:35.050
Damn it.

01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:37.755
What the hell did I do?

01:06:37.856 --> 01:06:40.126
Why? Why me, Bondrewd?

01:06:41.162 --> 01:06:42.464
Astonishing.

01:06:42.565 --> 01:06:45.070
Even under such
extreme conditions

01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:48.744
I see your sensitivity and
ability to absorb information

01:06:48.844 --> 01:06:50.982
did not diminish
in the slightest.

01:06:51.082 --> 01:06:54.723
You are truly worthy of
receiving the Blessing.

01:06:54.823 --> 01:06:59.331
Now, Nanachi, something far
more enjoyable awaits you.

01:06:59.431 --> 01:07:01.670
Please come back and assist me.

01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:04.843
[Nanachi] You never change.
How can you not see it?

01:07:04.943 --> 01:07:06.379
You're insane.

01:07:06.479 --> 01:07:09.485
You. You're going to cram
Prushka to one of those

01:07:09.586 --> 01:07:12.457
just to attain your
Blessing or whatever,
aren't you?

01:07:12.559 --> 01:07:13.527
Aren't you?

01:07:13.627 --> 01:07:15.130
[gasp]

01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:16.132
[Riko] No, please.

01:07:16.232 --> 01:07:17.969
You gotta let Prushka go!

01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:20.106
[Bondrewd] Please put
your mind at ease.

01:07:20.207 --> 01:07:22.344
Prushka is sleeping
at the moment.

01:07:22.444 --> 01:07:24.248
I will release her soon enough.

01:07:24.348 --> 01:07:28.489
All that aside, I was under the
impression you had come back

01:07:28.591 --> 01:07:31.730
to create the raw
materials for "Your Worth."

01:07:31.830 --> 01:07:32.966
What does that mean?

01:07:33.066 --> 01:07:34.736
"The life-reverberating
stone."

01:07:34.836 --> 01:07:36.172
If I remember correctly,

01:07:36.272 --> 01:07:38.309
that's what white whistles
are carved out of.

01:07:38.409 --> 01:07:40.982
[Bondrewd] You mentioned
the Unmovable Sovereign.

01:07:41.082 --> 01:07:43.554
So I assume she had
told you about it,

01:07:43.654 --> 01:07:47.227
but I suppose she can
be rather ill-natured.

01:07:47.327 --> 01:07:52.672
The raw material for
Your Worth is a human being.

01:07:52.772 --> 01:07:54.408
You're kidding, right?

01:07:54.509 --> 01:07:57.548
We stand on the ruins
of a ritual site.

01:07:57.649 --> 01:08:00.220
To challenge the
sixth layer and beyond

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.190
from which one can never return,

01:08:02.291 --> 01:08:05.230
is to surrender oneself
to the Netherworld.

01:08:05.330 --> 01:08:06.867
This is where the preparations,

01:08:06.967 --> 01:08:10.373
as well as the ceremony for
that descent will carry out.

01:08:10.473 --> 01:08:13.948
However, not just anyone
makes for a suitable offering.

01:08:14.048 --> 01:08:16.887
Without the resolve to
sacrifice everything

01:08:16.987 --> 01:08:18.189
from the intended user,

01:08:18.289 --> 01:08:21.195
the life insignia
cannot be compatible.

01:08:21.295 --> 01:08:24.368
The timbre of the instrument
also has the power

01:08:24.468 --> 01:08:28.142
to draw out the "true
purpose" within all relics.

01:08:28.242 --> 01:08:31.182
That doesn't sound
so bad, does it?

01:08:31.282 --> 01:08:33.186
I think I get it now.

01:08:33.286 --> 01:08:35.758
Bondrewd, you used
yourself as the offering

01:08:35.858 --> 01:08:36.927
for your whistle.

01:08:37.027 --> 01:08:39.532
Well, well, you
have keen insight.

01:08:39.633 --> 01:08:41.903
And also the experiments
that led to the cartridges.

01:08:42.004 --> 01:08:44.241
You came upon those ideas
while you were fiddling

01:08:44.341 --> 01:08:46.379
with how to produce
"Your Worth," didn't you?

01:08:46.479 --> 01:08:48.784
Very interesting, child.

01:08:48.884 --> 01:08:52.759
You may be much more like
us than I first imagined.

01:08:52.859 --> 01:08:54.763
I can understand
having great ambitions,

01:08:54.863 --> 01:08:57.535
but there's no way I can
even begin to forgive you.

01:08:57.635 --> 01:09:00.373
If you're capable of making
an offering of yourself,

01:09:00.473 --> 01:09:03.514
then you should do that to
make your own damn cartridges.

01:09:03.614 --> 01:09:07.220
[Bondrewd] This is from back
when I was still human.

01:09:07.321 --> 01:09:11.062
We who have come here after,
though possessing a mind,

01:09:11.162 --> 01:09:14.134
have been seen as
non-living things and thus

01:09:14.234 --> 01:09:16.105
cannot be used as such.

01:09:16.205 --> 01:09:18.276
Most regrettable.

01:09:18.977 --> 01:09:20.548
Yeah, but still...

01:09:20.648 --> 01:09:23.353
How could you do
that to Prushka?

01:09:24.388 --> 01:09:25.624
For just buying time,
this has been

01:09:25.725 --> 01:09:28.764
far too shocking for you,
but he's here.

01:09:29.833 --> 01:09:31.435
[Riko grunts]

01:09:40.086 --> 01:09:42.558
[eerie, tense music]

01:09:48.704 --> 01:09:50.775
[bones cracking]

01:09:51.576 --> 01:09:54.048
Uh, hey, Reg, are you okay?

01:09:54.148 --> 01:09:57.054
My, my, how about that?

01:09:57.154 --> 01:09:59.391
All the commotion has been you?

01:09:59.491 --> 01:10:03.299
I see you've gotten rather
sneaky, haven't you?

01:10:03.399 --> 01:10:06.540
Be careful, Reg, he's fully
equipped with cartridges!

01:10:07.875 --> 01:10:09.478
[Reg grunts]

01:10:12.117 --> 01:10:14.121
[Reg growls]

01:10:14.221 --> 01:10:16.893
Aren't you in fine spirits?

01:10:21.970 --> 01:10:24.374
[Reg growling]

01:10:26.178 --> 01:10:28.116
[roaring]

01:10:28.216 --> 01:10:30.988
Look at that. What the
hell happened to Reg?

01:10:31.088 --> 01:10:32.457
He seems kind of crazy.

01:10:32.558 --> 01:10:35.130
[Riko] He sure is worked up.

01:10:35.230 --> 01:10:37.134
Meinya!

01:10:37.234 --> 01:10:39.271
You take care of things here.

01:10:40.541 --> 01:10:43.547
Prushka, I'm coming.
Be there soon.

01:10:43.647 --> 01:10:46.118
[Bondrewd] You're a
peculiar one, aren't you?

01:10:46.218 --> 01:10:48.891
You've sucked even the
reserve electricity dry,

01:10:48.991 --> 01:10:53.499
or rather you have taken in
that power and made it your own.

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:57.775
This is my chance to see the
true ability of an Aubade.

01:11:01.983 --> 01:11:03.587
Show it to me.

01:11:08.029 --> 01:11:09.131
[Reg yells]

01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:10.968
He deflected it!

01:11:15.009 --> 01:11:16.378
Sparagmos.

01:11:16.479 --> 01:11:19.652
[Reg groans and yells]

01:11:34.983 --> 01:11:36.152
Ah.

01:11:36.252 --> 01:11:38.757
Simply spectacular.

01:11:38.857 --> 01:11:43.032
I truly regret removing
one of your arms.

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:49.344
It might very well please me
to have that body of yours.

01:11:51.081 --> 01:11:52.618
[Reg yelling]

01:11:52.718 --> 01:11:55.991
[Nanachi] <i>Reg...</i>
<i>What's happened to you?</i>

01:11:58.029 --> 01:12:00.400
I think you've lost more
than just your memory.

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:03.306
You've turned into
something else.

01:12:03.406 --> 01:12:05.076
[Bondrewd] Careful now.

01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:08.617
<i>But either way, at this point,</i>

01:12:08.717 --> 01:12:11.656
<i>you're now an even</i>
<i>match for Bondrewd.</i>

01:12:11.756 --> 01:12:14.896
[Bondrewd] I would love to
witness more of your prowess,

01:12:14.996 --> 01:12:18.837
but I can't have you destroying
any more of my facilities.

01:12:18.937 --> 01:12:20.708
Far Caress.

01:12:21.943 --> 01:12:23.145
And close.

01:12:23.246 --> 01:12:24.816
[Reg yells]

01:12:24.916 --> 01:12:26.018
No!

01:12:26.118 --> 01:12:28.055
[Reg groaning]

01:12:29.692 --> 01:12:30.661
Damn it!

01:12:30.761 --> 01:12:32.364
The cartridges are
emitting consciousness.

01:12:32.464 --> 01:12:34.802
I can't read what he's
gonna do next!

01:12:35.470 --> 01:12:37.407
[Riko] <i>Nanachi...</i>

01:12:37.508 --> 01:12:40.179
Where are you, Riko?
What have you been doing?

01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:41.716
<i>I found it.</i>

01:12:42.317 --> 01:12:43.921
The Zoaholic.

01:12:45.223 --> 01:12:47.460
I still don't know
where Prushka is.

01:12:47.562 --> 01:12:50.768
There's something else.
It's right beside it.

01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:54.341
No, don't. Listen, Riko,

01:12:54.441 --> 01:12:57.615
don't show it to me
under any circumstances.

01:12:57.715 --> 01:13:00.353
[Nanachi] <i>'Cause if worst</i>
<i>comes to worst then--</i>

01:13:01.355 --> 01:13:02.257
Nanachi?

01:13:02.357 --> 01:13:03.660
[charging sound]

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:05.029
Oh no.

01:13:09.071 --> 01:13:11.175
[Nanachi] <i>The Incinerator.</i>

01:13:11.275 --> 01:13:12.812
<i>The force field's calmed down?</i>

01:13:12.912 --> 01:13:15.383
<i>It's all tensed up since the</i>
<i>presumed scale of destruction</i>

01:13:15.483 --> 01:13:16.786
<i>is so huge!</i>

01:13:16.886 --> 01:13:20.661
[Bondrewd] The light of
the essential element?

01:13:20.761 --> 01:13:23.533
[Nanachi] <i>He's going to</i>
<i>destroy the entire base.</i>

01:13:23.634 --> 01:13:27.474
Riko, run! Get as far
away from here as you can!

01:13:28.644 --> 01:13:30.313
Nanachi, you mustn't!

01:13:30.413 --> 01:13:31.716
[yelling]

01:13:31.816 --> 01:13:33.486
Are you stupid or something?

01:13:33.587 --> 01:13:37.962
Reg! Don't forget what it
is you treasure. Stop it!

01:13:38.062 --> 01:13:40.601
[Nanachi yelling]

01:13:43.674 --> 01:13:45.945
[explosion booming]

01:13:52.057 --> 01:13:54.529
[whimpering]

01:14:03.245 --> 01:14:04.682
Ah?

01:14:08.289 --> 01:14:10.828
[yelling]

01:14:15.938 --> 01:14:17.440
[gasp]

01:14:21.650 --> 01:14:23.620
What the...

01:14:27.895 --> 01:14:29.131
Nanachi!

01:14:30.567 --> 01:14:32.070
What, what have...

01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:33.907
What have I done?

01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:38.115
Well, you put on quite a show.

01:14:38.215 --> 01:14:40.386
[Riko] <i>Nanachi!</i>

01:14:40.486 --> 01:14:42.490
I hear you, Riko. You okay?

01:14:42.591 --> 01:14:43.727
[Riko] <i>I'm alright.</i>

01:14:43.827 --> 01:14:47.067
Good. I'm glad.
Come on back here.

01:14:47.167 --> 01:14:48.570
Riko said that she's fine.

01:14:48.670 --> 01:14:50.941
So what in the world
got into you?

01:14:51.041 --> 01:14:54.916
I remember up to the point I
bathed myself in electricity.

01:14:55.016 --> 01:14:57.688
It felt like a whole
bunch of different people

01:14:57.788 --> 01:14:59.726
were all inside me.

01:14:59.826 --> 01:15:03.299
And one of them took
complete control of my body.

01:15:03.399 --> 01:15:04.569
Thank you, Nanachi.

01:15:04.669 --> 01:15:06.606
I only snapped out
of it thanks to you.

01:15:06.706 --> 01:15:10.681
Well, I guess my words
actually did reach you, huh?

01:15:10.781 --> 01:15:14.822
It was more like
your fluffiness.

01:15:14.922 --> 01:15:16.058
Mm?

01:15:19.231 --> 01:15:21.502
[Nanachi groaning]

01:15:21.603 --> 01:15:23.874
-Ow.
-Good grief.

01:15:23.974 --> 01:15:26.078
Here, stuff this in your ear.

01:15:26.178 --> 01:15:27.715
That a comm device?

01:15:27.815 --> 01:15:28.950
I stuck one on your helmet,

01:15:29.051 --> 01:15:31.623
which you've managed
to lose, of course.

01:15:32.525 --> 01:15:34.996
Anyway, what happened
to that bastard?

01:15:35.096 --> 01:15:36.432
I'm not sure.

01:15:36.533 --> 01:15:40.073
[Reg] Maybe he got engulfed
by the explosion?

01:15:40.173 --> 01:15:42.611
-[crash]
-[footsteps]

01:15:43.847 --> 01:15:47.922
Accompany me.
This way, please.

01:15:53.099 --> 01:15:57.173
Let him go!

01:16:03.052 --> 01:16:05.557
[wind howls]

01:16:09.431 --> 01:16:11.603
[Reg grunts]

01:16:14.876 --> 01:16:17.648
Damn it. Where am I?

01:16:19.484 --> 01:16:21.990
Did I fall from
all the way up there?

01:16:23.192 --> 01:16:25.597
[cooing]

01:16:29.539 --> 01:16:31.208
Are these what I think they are?

01:16:31.308 --> 01:16:32.878
[Bondrewd] Shakko,

01:16:33.847 --> 01:16:38.657
Etan, Sumiko, Puel.

01:16:40.561 --> 01:16:44.535
You see, Aubade,
they all have names.

01:16:44.635 --> 01:16:47.140
[Reg] What? How are
you still here?

01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:48.877
[Bondrewd] Really now?

01:16:48.977 --> 01:16:52.050
It is you who have
chosen it to be this way.

01:16:52.818 --> 01:16:53.954
What do you mean?

01:16:54.054 --> 01:16:57.360
Oh, so it was not
deliberate then?

01:16:57.460 --> 01:16:59.231
Regardless,
I cannot say I'm happy

01:16:59.331 --> 01:17:02.805
about you destroying the
ground beneath our feet.

01:17:02.905 --> 01:17:07.280
That light of yours might
be a little too dangerous.

01:17:08.215 --> 01:17:10.086
[dramatic music]

01:17:13.425 --> 01:17:15.597
Now we can test both your light

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:18.235
AND my precious masterpieces.

01:17:19.639 --> 01:17:22.243
[Bondrewd] Please show
what you can do.

01:17:22.343 --> 01:17:25.249
Show me everything.

01:17:25.349 --> 01:17:27.086
[Reg] <i>These hollows.</i>

01:17:27.187 --> 01:17:28.924
<i>They used to be...</i>

01:17:32.865 --> 01:17:34.735
[Reg grunts]

01:17:49.197 --> 01:17:50.834
[Bondrewd] Easy...

01:17:54.742 --> 01:17:56.613
This is most surprising.

01:17:56.713 --> 01:17:59.919
You are even more agile
now than before.

01:18:00.019 --> 01:18:02.257
It's surprising to me too.

01:18:02.357 --> 01:18:04.996
<i>It's as if "someone"</i>
<i>made me remember,</i>

01:18:05.096 --> 01:18:07.433
<i>remember how to use this body,</i>

01:18:07.535 --> 01:18:10.373
<i>and that I have to stop</i>
<i>him or our adventure ends</i>

01:18:10.473 --> 01:18:12.578
<i>right here and now.</i>

01:18:12.678 --> 01:18:15.517
[Bondrewd] It has begun.

01:18:15.617 --> 01:18:18.055
-[Nanachi] Reg, Reg!
-Nanachi...

01:18:18.155 --> 01:18:19.559
<i>You've already fired</i>
<i>the Incinerator,</i>

01:18:19.659 --> 01:18:20.928
<i>so I'll keep this</i>
<i>short and sweet.</i>

01:18:21.028 --> 01:18:23.733
<i>You need to know</i>
<i>the final game plan.</i>

01:18:27.173 --> 01:18:28.610
I understand.

01:18:28.710 --> 01:18:30.379
It's a do or die time.

01:18:34.454 --> 01:18:37.761
[Bondrewd] Right after I
requested a change of scenery...

01:18:37.861 --> 01:18:39.932
How callous of you.

01:18:41.435 --> 01:18:44.407
[climatic music]

01:19:00.507 --> 01:19:02.010
[Reg grunts]

01:19:02.110 --> 01:19:03.880
[Nanachi] <i>Bondrewd is</i>
<i>holding off the Curse</i>

01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:07.086
<i>with the cartridges, but</i>
<i>they won't last forever.</i>

01:19:07.186 --> 01:19:10.359
<i>Concentrate on evading him</i>
<i>and make him use them all up.</i>

01:19:10.459 --> 01:19:12.430
<i>Don't think that you</i>
<i>must strike him down.</i>

01:19:12.531 --> 01:19:16.104
<i>As long as the Zoaholic</i>
<i>remains intact, he's immortal.</i>

01:19:16.204 --> 01:19:18.743
<i>The current Bondrewd</i>
<i>can move about freely.</i>

01:19:18.843 --> 01:19:20.747
<i>The Incinerator needs</i>
<i>a long prep time</i>

01:19:20.847 --> 01:19:22.618
<i>and it's unlikely</i>
<i>to hit him anyway.</i>

01:19:22.718 --> 01:19:24.421
<i>You've gotta make it</i>
<i>back here somehow</i>

01:19:24.522 --> 01:19:26.325
<i>before your time limits up.</i>

01:19:35.109 --> 01:19:36.746
My, my.

01:19:36.846 --> 01:19:39.652
It would seem
Recima is finished.

01:19:39.752 --> 01:19:42.958
She was one of my most
kindhearted creations.

01:19:43.058 --> 01:19:46.699
She once dreamed of becoming
a princess, you know?

01:19:46.799 --> 01:19:49.371
Isn't that adorable?

01:19:49.471 --> 01:19:51.241
[loud boom]

01:19:55.149 --> 01:19:57.320
[Nanachi] The water
bastion collapsed!

01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:58.957
Watch out, Reg!

01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:27.280
[Reg yells]

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:37.968
Hey, Reg, over here.

01:20:47.755 --> 01:20:50.927
[ground rumbles]

01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:55.904
Ah...

01:20:57.006 --> 01:20:58.743
So this is it.

01:20:58.843 --> 01:21:01.281
This must be the Blessing.

01:21:04.855 --> 01:21:08.630
Takiri. Toreithea. Nopero.

01:21:19.685 --> 01:21:21.622
[Meinya mewing]

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:26.498
[mew]

01:21:27.735 --> 01:21:29.939
[Bondrewd] Ah.

01:21:30.039 --> 01:21:33.546
It was certainly a glorious
adventure, was it not?

01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:35.584
Prushka?

01:21:35.684 --> 01:21:37.888
[Meinya cries out]

01:21:37.988 --> 01:21:40.025
[both gasp]

01:21:40.459 --> 01:21:42.998
[mewing]

01:21:43.733 --> 01:21:45.503
Wait, what is...

01:21:45.604 --> 01:21:47.473
What's Meinya doing?

01:21:49.411 --> 01:21:50.212
Don't tell me...

01:21:50.312 --> 01:21:52.785
Is that-- Is that Prushka?

01:21:52.885 --> 01:21:54.588
Reg, I...

01:21:54.688 --> 01:21:56.793
[Reg] Prushka...

01:21:56.893 --> 01:21:59.865
She cried over you
'cause she cares for you.

01:21:59.965 --> 01:22:02.036
[Bondrewd] What a strange
thing for you to say,

01:22:02.136 --> 01:22:04.809
considering your desire
to kill me.

01:22:04.909 --> 01:22:07.246
Come now, preparations
for stepping

01:22:07.346 --> 01:22:11.021
into the next 2,000
years are now complete.

01:22:11.121 --> 01:22:14.160
Let us witness
the dawn together.

01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:17.467
Go to Hell.

01:22:18.302 --> 01:22:20.272
How could you possibly do it?

01:22:20.372 --> 01:22:21.976
How could you turn
your beloved

01:22:22.076 --> 01:22:23.947
daughter into one
of those things?

01:22:24.047 --> 01:22:25.884
What is wrong with you?

01:22:25.984 --> 01:22:27.153
Let's finish this!

01:22:27.253 --> 01:22:29.658
You got it. Now on
with the plan.

01:22:29.758 --> 01:22:31.461
Riko, can you hear me?

01:22:31.562 --> 01:22:32.598
[Riko crying]

01:22:32.698 --> 01:22:34.969
<i>Riko, please respond.</i>

01:22:35.570 --> 01:22:36.606
<i>Riko!</i>

01:22:37.708 --> 01:22:39.477
[Riko] Prushka...

01:22:40.045 --> 01:22:41.949
Prushka...

01:22:50.534 --> 01:22:51.836
[Prushka] <i>It hurts.</i>

01:22:51.936 --> 01:22:54.073
<i>It hurts so bad.</i>

01:22:55.610 --> 01:22:57.246
<i>I'm scared!</i>

01:22:59.852 --> 01:23:01.421
[footsteps]

01:23:01.522 --> 01:23:03.693
[Bondrewd]
How's it going, Gueira?

01:23:03.793 --> 01:23:06.331
[Gueira] This one's
proven difficult, sir.

01:23:06.431 --> 01:23:08.235
The Curse is deeply ingrained.

01:23:08.335 --> 01:23:10.807
Her sense of self has
been stripped away.

01:23:10.907 --> 01:23:13.445
Child, do you know
who you are?

01:23:13.546 --> 01:23:15.382
[screaming]

01:23:15.482 --> 01:23:17.253
[Gueira] Though the
daughter of an Umbra Hand,

01:23:17.353 --> 01:23:19.625
she's a survivor of
the carrier failure.

01:23:19.725 --> 01:23:23.933
As it stands, making use of
her would be exceedingly cruel.

01:23:24.033 --> 01:23:27.106
Perhaps terminating
her would be best?

01:23:29.077 --> 01:23:31.516
[Prushka screaming]

01:23:36.559 --> 01:23:38.830
[Bondrewd] A prayer
cannot be born

01:23:38.930 --> 01:23:40.867
from one who only knows joy.

01:23:40.967 --> 01:23:44.407
O child of suffering
who curses life itself,

01:23:44.508 --> 01:23:47.681
there is something only
you can accomplish.

01:23:47.781 --> 01:23:50.520
Your name shall be "Prushka."

01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:54.427
Meaning, you are
the "flower of dawn."

01:23:54.528 --> 01:23:57.166
I am your Papa.

01:23:57.266 --> 01:23:59.270
I am your father.

01:23:59.872 --> 01:24:00.840
Prushka.

01:24:00.941 --> 01:24:03.613
[whimpering]

01:24:03.713 --> 01:24:08.055
[Gueira] Come on, Prushka,
time for your medicine.

01:24:08.155 --> 01:24:09.725
Come here.

01:24:10.727 --> 01:24:11.896
[Prushka grunting]

01:24:11.996 --> 01:24:14.067
[Bondrewd] How is
she doing, Gueira?

01:24:14.167 --> 01:24:18.275
She's been like this
the whole time.

01:24:18.375 --> 01:24:22.316
[Bondrewd] Prushka,
I brought you a friend today.

01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:29.163
[Bondrewd] Meinastilim.

01:24:29.264 --> 01:24:32.203
It's called a "Child of Change."

01:24:35.977 --> 01:24:37.648
Me--Meinya?

01:24:39.551 --> 01:24:43.225
[Bondrewd] Ah, have
you taken a liking to it?

01:24:43.325 --> 01:24:46.632
No, no, you mustn't
put it in your mouth.

01:24:50.941 --> 01:24:52.644
[Gueira] Oh, look at this.

01:24:53.846 --> 01:24:55.449
[Prushka] Meinya.

01:24:55.550 --> 01:24:57.219
[mewing]

01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:01.461
Prushka, it's good to see you
discovering your affections.

01:25:01.562 --> 01:25:06.104
From this moment forward,
your world will begin to change.

01:25:06.204 --> 01:25:07.541
From now on,

01:25:07.641 --> 01:25:11.081
you will grow as a person
with each and every step.

01:25:11.181 --> 01:25:13.452
Today is the day of your birth.

01:25:13.553 --> 01:25:16.391
The beginning of your adventure.

01:25:18.161 --> 01:25:20.800
[Gueira] You like that? Mm?

01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:22.537
You can have it if you want.

01:25:22.638 --> 01:25:24.675
That good, huh?
What a waste.

01:25:24.775 --> 01:25:28.750
I mean there's so much
tasty stuff in the Abyss.

01:25:28.850 --> 01:25:30.587
Tasty can be eaten?

01:25:30.687 --> 01:25:32.624
In way. Yes.

01:25:35.162 --> 01:25:37.299
Do you know what
tasty is, little Meinya?

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.605
Maybe it tastes like you.

01:25:40.272 --> 01:25:42.844
[laughing] Pee-ew!

01:25:43.946 --> 01:25:47.521
Meinya! Wait for me! Meinya!

01:25:47.621 --> 01:25:50.359
No, you can't go in there, stop!

01:25:56.004 --> 01:25:57.708
All right then.

01:25:58.375 --> 01:26:00.312
[loud cracking]

01:26:00.412 --> 01:26:02.350
[Gueira] The fingernails
on both hands,

01:26:02.450 --> 01:26:06.124
her upper left arm and all
her baby teeth were broken.

01:26:06.224 --> 01:26:08.495
Her spinal cord remains intact.

01:26:08.596 --> 01:26:11.736
But as to whether her
psyche can be brought back,

01:26:11.836 --> 01:26:13.372
it's hard to say.

01:26:13.472 --> 01:26:15.309
[Bondrewd] It will be fine.

01:26:15.409 --> 01:26:19.785
Prushka's psyche sprang forth
from a far deeper place.

01:26:19.885 --> 01:26:22.958
I am sure it will return soon.

01:26:23.058 --> 01:26:25.630
Let us watch over her with care.

01:26:27.266 --> 01:26:28.803
Look at my hair.

01:26:28.903 --> 01:26:31.107
It's all twirly and curly now.

01:26:31.207 --> 01:26:34.681
So, Meinya, why are you
still totally fine?

01:26:36.919 --> 01:26:38.422
Okay.

01:26:38.523 --> 01:26:40.693
I have to investigate.

01:26:42.029 --> 01:26:43.298
Pretty amazing, huh?

01:26:43.398 --> 01:26:44.835
When I take a sniff off Meinya,

01:26:44.935 --> 01:26:47.440
I can see fuzzy stuff where
I usually can't see anything.

01:26:47.541 --> 01:26:49.410
[Gueira] You never
learn, do you?

01:26:49.511 --> 01:26:51.014
Is your papa
okay with this?

01:26:51.114 --> 01:26:52.617
Just letting you run
around, I mean?

01:26:52.718 --> 01:26:55.724
Oh, it's fine.
And Papa doesn't need to know.

01:26:55.824 --> 01:26:57.026
[Prushka laughs]

01:26:57.126 --> 01:26:59.297
[Gueira] Oh, child.

01:26:59.397 --> 01:27:02.036
Meinya, use those eyes
of yours that see everything

01:27:02.136 --> 01:27:04.006
and watch me on my adventures.

01:27:04.107 --> 01:27:06.946
[Prushka chuckling]

01:27:09.150 --> 01:27:11.221
[laughing]

01:27:11.321 --> 01:27:13.391
[mewing]

01:27:14.528 --> 01:27:18.736
[playful instrumental music]

01:27:59.818 --> 01:28:02.724
[Bondrewd] Some very special
and important visitors

01:28:02.824 --> 01:28:04.093
are coming soon.

01:28:04.193 --> 01:28:07.366
They are people who
are going to help me.

01:28:07.466 --> 01:28:10.573
Prushka, I would like for
you to keep them company.

01:28:10.673 --> 01:28:11.775
Oh, yes.

01:28:11.876 --> 01:28:14.615
And one of them is the
daughter of a White Whistle

01:28:14.715 --> 01:28:15.817
just like you.

01:28:15.917 --> 01:28:19.123
So I'm sure the two of you
will become fast friends

01:28:19.223 --> 01:28:20.960
in no time at all.

01:28:22.163 --> 01:28:25.937
Seriously, Papa, I mean, you
already have me, don't you?

01:28:27.774 --> 01:28:28.976
Hey, um, Meinya,

01:28:29.076 --> 01:28:31.649
our visitors came down here
all the way from that place

01:28:31.749 --> 01:28:33.820
called the surface, didn't they?

01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:35.189
[Meinya mews]

01:28:35.289 --> 01:28:38.261
So then they've probably
seen a dawn.

01:28:38.361 --> 01:28:40.667
I wonder what that
would be like.

01:28:42.002 --> 01:28:44.106
Well, I'm most certainly
better at cleaning up

01:28:44.207 --> 01:28:45.510
than they are.

01:28:45.610 --> 01:28:47.246
The trees grow upside down

01:28:47.346 --> 01:28:50.152
and the waterfalls
all flow upward!

01:28:50.252 --> 01:28:51.522
Really?

01:28:51.622 --> 01:28:53.893
I've never seen anything
like that around here.

01:28:53.993 --> 01:28:55.062
[Riko] You know what--

01:28:55.162 --> 01:28:58.301
[Prushka] <i>I listened, I learned.</i>

01:28:58.401 --> 01:29:01.474
<i>I found out about things</i>
<i>I've never heard of.</i>

01:29:01.575 --> 01:29:03.980
<i>Creatures I'd never heard of.</i>

01:29:05.249 --> 01:29:09.257
<i>Precious friends, fun.</i>

01:29:09.357 --> 01:29:14.267
<i>Laughter, faces</i>
<i>I've never made.</i>

01:29:14.367 --> 01:29:16.772
<i>Words I'd never used...</i>

01:29:17.841 --> 01:29:19.443
<i>And more.</i>

01:29:19.545 --> 01:29:21.481
<i>So much more...</i>

01:29:22.116 --> 01:29:24.521
<i>More... together.</i>

01:29:28.996 --> 01:29:30.833
<i>My arms...</i>

01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:35.643
<i>My legs...</i>

01:29:38.315 --> 01:29:39.751
<i>And my...</i>

01:29:39.851 --> 01:29:41.722
<i>What is that?</i>

01:29:42.924 --> 01:29:44.661
<i>It hurts.</i>

01:29:44.761 --> 01:29:47.534
<i>It hurts so much.</i>

01:29:50.172 --> 01:29:52.577
[sloshing sound]

01:29:53.144 --> 01:29:54.648
<i>The pain.</i>

01:29:54.748 --> 01:29:56.585
<i>It keeps getting worse.</i>

01:29:56.685 --> 01:29:59.958
[light heartbeat]

01:30:01.595 --> 01:30:04.968
[Prushka] <i>Papa's pain,</i>
<i>Papa's feelings.</i>

01:30:05.068 --> 01:30:07.139
<i>They're flooding into me.</i>

01:30:07.239 --> 01:30:08.809
<i>My pain.</i>

01:30:08.910 --> 01:30:11.381
<i>It's turning into</i>
<i>Papa's strength.</i>

01:30:11.481 --> 01:30:13.318
[charging sound]

01:30:13.418 --> 01:30:15.489
[slow, dramatic music]

01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:17.259
[explosion]

01:30:17.359 --> 01:30:20.198
<i>Papa. Papa, I'm here.</i>

01:30:20.299 --> 01:30:22.704
<i>I'm with you.</i>

01:30:22.804 --> 01:30:24.675
<i>Now, no matter how</i>
<i>hard things get,</i>

01:30:24.775 --> 01:30:27.179
<i>no matter how dark</i>
<i>the night is,</i>

01:30:27.279 --> 01:30:29.417
<i>we can overcome it together.</i>

01:30:29.518 --> 01:30:30.753
[Reg groans]

01:30:30.853 --> 01:30:32.423
[Bondrewd] It seems
these claws can pierce

01:30:32.524 --> 01:30:34.393
through your less
protected areas.

01:30:34.493 --> 01:30:36.264
[crunching sound]

01:30:36.364 --> 01:30:39.003
Although your body is
excessively durable,

01:30:39.103 --> 01:30:42.076
it is most helpful that
even your weak points

01:30:42.176 --> 01:30:43.913
are fashioned
after a human's.

01:30:44.013 --> 01:30:45.315
You told me...

01:30:45.415 --> 01:30:47.787
You said that even my pain,

01:30:47.887 --> 01:30:51.461
you said even my pain
is an imitation.

01:30:51.562 --> 01:30:53.699
[Bondrewd] Indeed.
You are well made.

01:30:53.799 --> 01:30:57.741
Even your insides hold
the worth of humanity.

01:30:57.841 --> 01:31:00.345
[Reg] So if this pain
is just an imitation,

01:31:00.445 --> 01:31:02.550
I can still move!

01:31:02.651 --> 01:31:05.723
And I'll show you
that this will of mine

01:31:05.823 --> 01:31:09.731
is as real as it gets!

01:31:11.735 --> 01:31:13.572
[Prushka] <i>Please, Papa.</i>

01:31:13.673 --> 01:31:15.576
<i>I have just one thing.</i>

01:31:15.677 --> 01:31:18.081
<i>Just one thing to ask of you.</i>

01:31:19.751 --> 01:31:21.955
Reg, Riko, do it!

01:31:22.056 --> 01:31:25.028
[Prushka] <i>Papa,</i>
<i>just one thing.</i>

01:31:27.333 --> 01:31:30.807
<i>I want you to make peace</i>
<i>with Riko and her friends.</i>

01:31:31.709 --> 01:31:34.246
<i>You don't have to fight.</i>

01:31:34.347 --> 01:31:39.256
<i>I mean after all, we're going</i>
<i>to go on adventures together.</i>

01:31:39.357 --> 01:31:41.260
[music swells]

01:31:41.361 --> 01:31:44.835
<i>So many amazing adventures.</i>

01:31:56.658 --> 01:31:58.529
[Nanachi] Reg, Reg!

01:31:58.629 --> 01:32:00.867
Come on, don't you die on me.

01:32:00.967 --> 01:32:02.637
-Nanachi.
-No, don't try to say anything.

01:32:02.737 --> 01:32:05.108
I'll fix you no matter
what it takes.

01:32:05.208 --> 01:32:08.983
Nanachi, your hand.

01:32:13.124 --> 01:32:15.028
[inhaling]

01:32:15.128 --> 01:32:18.168
[Reg] Thanks.
I've calmed down a bit.

01:32:18.268 --> 01:32:20.606
I'm sorry. I'm fading.

01:32:20.707 --> 01:32:23.546
Take care of Riko.

01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:31.294
[Riko sobbing]

01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:36.204
[gasp]

01:32:43.384 --> 01:32:45.723
You have surprised me, child.

01:32:45.823 --> 01:32:49.296
You managed to get the
severed arm to function.

01:32:49.396 --> 01:32:51.501
You exerted all
of your strength,

01:32:51.602 --> 01:32:54.508
used your wits, and
each of you took action

01:32:54.608 --> 01:32:56.411
most brilliantly.

01:32:56.512 --> 01:32:57.947
Truly moving.

01:32:58.047 --> 01:33:00.419
Yeah, well that's
enough of your blabbering.

01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:01.822
And from the looks of it,

01:33:01.922 --> 01:33:03.893
no one's coming out to
protect you this time.

01:33:03.993 --> 01:33:05.730
Which must mean you
no longer have any

01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:07.667
Umbra Hands left
to fight us,

01:33:07.767 --> 01:33:10.439
making us free to destroy
the remaining facilities,

01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:12.544
including the Zoaholic.

01:33:12.644 --> 01:33:14.714
There are so many of you
now we couldn't kill you

01:33:14.815 --> 01:33:19.323
even if we tried, but your
disgusting aspirations

01:33:19.423 --> 01:33:20.459
end right here.

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:24.300
-It is over.
-Oh, heavens no.

01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:28.709
Your prayers, your ardent
desire to choose your own paths

01:33:28.809 --> 01:33:32.817
and push forward, they've
surpassed even my own.

01:33:32.917 --> 01:33:36.257
Although, it is most
regrettable that this body

01:33:36.357 --> 01:33:38.328
has been destroyed.

01:33:38.428 --> 01:33:41.768
Crossing paths and having
the chance to clash with you

01:33:41.869 --> 01:33:44.206
was an unparalleled joy.

01:33:44.306 --> 01:33:48.348
The fact that you will all
continue on beyond this place

01:33:48.448 --> 01:33:52.222
is now my new aspiration.

01:33:52.322 --> 01:33:55.061
It's totally pointless
saying anything to you.

01:33:55.162 --> 01:33:59.671
You're sick, and you're
unbelievably pathetic.

01:33:59.771 --> 01:34:00.807
It's funny.

01:34:00.907 --> 01:34:02.042
I've long dreamed of the day

01:34:02.142 --> 01:34:04.915
we'd kill each other
in battle, but now...

01:34:05.015 --> 01:34:06.685
Ah, Nanachi.

01:34:06.785 --> 01:34:10.560
It pleases me things did
not turn out that way.

01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:12.129
Come now.

01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:14.200
Raise your head up high.

01:34:17.406 --> 01:34:21.715
Child, may your journey overflow

01:34:21.815 --> 01:34:25.923
with both Curses and Blessings.

01:34:30.633 --> 01:34:33.137
[Nanachi whimpers]

01:34:35.710 --> 01:34:37.780
You can shut up now.

01:34:37.881 --> 01:34:44.728
Ah, you are truly,
truly adorable.

01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:52.610
It's kind of ironic, you know?

01:34:52.710 --> 01:34:55.448
If I hadn't fallen for
your honeyed words,

01:34:55.550 --> 01:34:58.054
then none of this
would've happened.

01:35:03.131 --> 01:35:05.068
[gasp]

01:35:05.168 --> 01:35:09.076
Ah, you're finally awake.
That's a relief.

01:35:09.176 --> 01:35:10.445
Nanachi? Ow!

01:35:10.546 --> 01:35:13.418
[Nanachi] I took a peek and your
insides don't seem injured.

01:35:13.519 --> 01:35:16.925
And judging from how you're
acting, you'll be fine.

01:35:17.794 --> 01:35:20.298
[Reg] Did we-- did we do it?

01:35:20.398 --> 01:35:23.872
Yeah, there are a few of
the Umbra Hands still left,

01:35:23.973 --> 01:35:26.712
but they no longer have the
power to get in our way anymore.

01:35:26.812 --> 01:35:29.283
-More importantly...
-[Riko sobbing]

01:35:31.521 --> 01:35:34.828
I don't like this.
It's not fair!

01:35:35.529 --> 01:35:36.932
Riko!

01:35:42.610 --> 01:35:43.579
Reg!

01:35:43.679 --> 01:35:45.549
Your tummy's hurt.

01:35:45.650 --> 01:35:47.987
It's okay. I'm going
to be all right, Riko.

01:35:48.087 --> 01:35:49.323
But I...

01:35:50.893 --> 01:35:52.429
Oh, Prushka.

01:35:52.530 --> 01:35:54.567
She feels so warm, but...

01:35:54.668 --> 01:35:57.439
Look, even though
she has a pulse.

01:35:57.540 --> 01:36:00.011
Huh? Here pulse is...

01:36:01.548 --> 01:36:04.186
Does it hurt facing like this?

01:36:05.756 --> 01:36:07.159
Ah!

01:36:08.896 --> 01:36:11.434
No! Prushka, I'm sorry!

01:36:11.535 --> 01:36:12.770
She's spilling out.

01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:14.373
She's, she's...

01:36:15.175 --> 01:36:16.344
Prushka!

01:36:17.279 --> 01:36:19.784

01:36:34.614 --> 01:36:36.484
[clattering]

01:36:39.423 --> 01:36:41.895
Hey, what is that thing?

01:36:48.542 --> 01:36:51.013
Is that you, Prushka?

01:36:52.249 --> 01:36:53.886
Seriously?

01:36:53.986 --> 01:36:55.589
You think she...

01:36:55.690 --> 01:36:57.527
Yeah. What else could it be?

01:36:57.627 --> 01:36:58.996
It must be, right?

01:36:59.096 --> 01:37:00.766
It's just so strange.

01:37:00.866 --> 01:37:02.670
[deep resonating tone]

01:37:02.770 --> 01:37:04.541
Whoa, whoa!

01:37:04.641 --> 01:37:06.377
What is it?
Is something wrong?

01:37:06.477 --> 01:37:09.984
It's like my belly.
It feels kind of warm.

01:37:11.354 --> 01:37:13.525
[Nanachi]
<i>A "life-reverberating stone."</i>

01:37:13.625 --> 01:37:15.228
<i>No way.</i>

01:37:15.328 --> 01:37:18.869
<i>But unless it's desired by</i>
<i>the subject who got packed,</i>

01:37:18.969 --> 01:37:20.506
<i>it would...</i>

01:37:20.606 --> 01:37:23.244
<i>I mean, for someone to be able</i>
<i>to care about another person</i>

01:37:23.344 --> 01:37:25.448
<i>while the curse is</i>
<i>forced upon them...</i>

01:37:25.549 --> 01:37:28.488
<i>And it was such a</i>
<i>short period of time.</i>

01:37:28.589 --> 01:37:30.526
Huh?

01:37:30.626 --> 01:37:33.097
[emotional music]

01:37:38.374 --> 01:37:39.677
Prushka...

01:37:39.778 --> 01:37:42.884
[Nanachi] Riko, can
I see that, please?

01:37:45.021 --> 01:37:50.031
Look. Leaving it exposed
is probably not good.

01:37:50.599 --> 01:37:52.002
Oh, Nanachi...

01:37:52.102 --> 01:37:54.507
You're probably
feeling a bit conflicted,

01:37:54.607 --> 01:37:56.578
but I'm sure that this
being entrusted to you

01:37:56.678 --> 01:37:59.316
is Prushka's will.

01:37:59.416 --> 01:38:02.222
You are the only one
who can use it.

01:38:02.322 --> 01:38:04.861
Though it may not
look too pretty,

01:38:04.961 --> 01:38:07.466
that is your white whistle.

01:38:10.271 --> 01:38:11.641
Nanachi!

01:38:13.478 --> 01:38:16.016
[Riko cries]

01:38:16.117 --> 01:38:19.156
[Nanachi yelling]

01:38:31.213 --> 01:38:34.052
[electrical humming]

01:38:34.153 --> 01:38:37.359
[Nanachi] Hmm, about
10 shots left, I'd say.

01:38:37.459 --> 01:38:40.265
[Reg] That reminds me,
I haven't eaten anything.

01:38:40.365 --> 01:38:43.004
[Nanachi] Pretty sure
you had your fill.

01:38:43.104 --> 01:38:46.043
The power at the base
is still out. You know?

01:38:46.878 --> 01:38:48.481
Are you two ready for this?

01:38:48.582 --> 01:38:52.155
Crying and eating? You're
quite the multitasker, Riko.

01:38:52.757 --> 01:38:54.594
Hey, Nanachi.

01:39:04.581 --> 01:39:05.983
Damn him.

01:39:06.083 --> 01:39:09.323
I should have shattered that
mask into a thousand pieces.

01:39:09.423 --> 01:39:10.492
Are you okay?

01:39:10.593 --> 01:39:13.197
We've come to an
understanding of sorts.

01:39:13.297 --> 01:39:17.773
Besides I'm gonna respect
our team leader's will.

01:39:17.874 --> 01:39:19.176
Come on, let's go!

01:39:19.276 --> 01:39:22.082
Our newest adventure is
just about to get started.

01:39:22.182 --> 01:39:24.119
[Meinya mews]

01:39:24.219 --> 01:39:26.190
[Bondrewd] <i>To those</i>
<i>who offer themselves</i>

01:39:26.290 --> 01:39:28.060
<i>to challenge the chasm,</i>

01:39:28.161 --> 01:39:31.267
<i>the chasm for which even</i>
<i>the darkness is no match,</i>

01:39:31.367 --> 01:39:35.008
<i>it is said the Abyss</i>
<i>grants an offering.</i>

01:39:35.108 --> 01:39:38.982
<i>Life and death,</i>
<i>Curses and Blessings.</i>

01:39:39.082 --> 01:39:40.619
<i>All of it.</i>

01:39:40.719 --> 01:39:43.659
Okay, Prushka, we go together.

01:39:43.759 --> 01:39:45.094
[mew]

01:39:45.195 --> 01:39:47.199
[Bondrewd] <i>At the end</i>
<i>of the journey,</i>

01:39:47.299 --> 01:39:49.369
<i>which offering is embraced,</i>

01:39:49.469 --> 01:39:53.979
<i>can only be decided by those</i>
<i>who face the challenge.</i>

01:39:54.079 --> 01:39:56.116
It's finally time.
It's our last dive.

01:39:56.217 --> 01:39:58.487
Here we are at long last.

01:39:58.589 --> 01:40:00.325
It's the beginning
of our final journey

01:40:00.425 --> 01:40:02.195
from which we can never
return.

01:40:02.295 --> 01:40:03.832
Are you two ready?

01:40:03.932 --> 01:40:05.536
Mm-hm!

01:40:06.872 --> 01:40:08.976
[rippling sound]

01:40:13.552 --> 01:40:15.121
Ah!

01:40:15.789 --> 01:40:17.693
[struggling groans]

01:40:17.793 --> 01:40:19.363
Hey!

01:40:30.218 --> 01:40:32.122
[Prushka] <i>No matter</i>
<i>how dark the darkness</i>

01:40:32.222 --> 01:40:35.161
<i>of the Netherworld gets,</i>
<i>you'll be fine.</i>

01:40:35.261 --> 01:40:37.700
<i>You're very bright, after all.</i>

01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:41.708
<i>So, Riko, you can do it.</i>

01:40:43.144 --> 01:40:45.181
<i>Push forward.</i>

01:40:56.136 --> 01:40:58.675
