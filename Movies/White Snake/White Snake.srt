1
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,433
May all beings and all be happy and free

2
00:01:24,512 --> 00:01:28,767
and may the thoughts, words and actions
of my own life contribute in some way

3
00:01:28,792 --> 00:01:30,933
to the happiness and freedom for all,

4
00:01:31,042 --> 00:01:32,262
may health abound forever.

5
00:01:32,287 --> 00:01:33,488
May peace.

6
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,386
Verta.

7
00:02:44,016 --> 00:02:44,891
Sister.

8
00:02:54,695 --> 00:02:56,512
I had that vision again.

9
00:02:57,793 --> 00:03:00,348
I've meditated for 500 years.

10
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,707
Immortality's nearly within reach.

11
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:08,871
But I can never break through the wall.

12
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,910
I know, it's always treacherous.

13
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:33,894
There's an emptiness inside my heart.

14
00:03:35,473 --> 00:03:37,308
It's missing something.

15
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:42,277
Why is it when I get close, I
always get thrown into all this chaos?

16
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,746
Just what is it that I lack?

17
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,215
Hold this hairpin.

18
00:03:56,113 --> 00:03:58,519
Hold it, you've always worn it.

19
00:03:58,808 --> 00:04:00,370
You've never let me...

20
00:04:02,574 --> 00:04:04,176
I'll allow it now.

21
00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:06,785
It was yours after all.

22
00:04:08,144 --> 00:04:09,910
Hold it tight.

23
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,793
Late in the Tang Dynasty, chaos reigned,

24
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:36,933
demons haunted the world.

25
00:04:36,996 --> 00:04:39,543
The emperor craved eternal life.

26
00:04:39,707 --> 00:04:44,698
His Dark General unable to fulfill
that desire, incurred his wrath.

27
00:04:44,723 --> 00:04:47,393
In order to regain the emperor's favor.

28
00:04:47,418 --> 00:04:51,863
The General had the people catch
snakes to feed his Daoist powers.

29
00:05:28,308 --> 00:05:32,175
Force of darkness, flow and gather.

30
00:05:32,644 --> 00:05:36,269
Spread your power across the land.

31
00:05:40,738 --> 00:05:44,875
Force of darkness, flow and gather.

32
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:49,558
Spread your power across the land.

33
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:57,511
Assassin!

34
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:00,980
Seize her!

35
00:06:01,968 --> 00:06:03,503
On her, positions!

36
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:12,839
Where is she?

37
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,816
There you are.

38
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:21,707
Who are you?

39
00:07:23,816 --> 00:07:26,535
It's a scary world, you're safe here.

40
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:28,988
Where are we?

41
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,839
Snake Catcher Village.

42
00:07:31,277 --> 00:07:34,152
What should I call you, where are you from?

43
00:07:49,793 --> 00:07:50,628
What's wrong?

44
00:07:50,808 --> 00:07:52,808
You don't remember anything?

45
00:07:56,463 --> 00:07:58,808
Oh, it's the snake catchers.

46
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:01,675
It was our young Xuan who saved you.

47
00:08:01,871 --> 00:08:02,738
So Xuan...

48
00:08:05,793 --> 00:08:09,996
We catch snakes for a living
and we build our houses this way

49
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:16,082
because the mountains and forests are
full of wild beasts and demons as well.

50
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,300
I'm a demon!

51
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,908
Careful where you run, kids.

52
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:22,242
Hey, wait!

53
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:24,042
The herbs Xuan picked out really worked!

54
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,414
I'm almost healed!

55
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,583
Be careful!

56
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,172
Catching snakes is dangerous!

57
00:08:28,196 --> 00:08:29,375
She's a real beauty.

58
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,725
Hua, can you lower that wine down?

59
00:08:31,816 --> 00:08:34,238
Sure, it's the good stuff too!

60
00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:35,308
Keeps snakes away!

61
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,746
Young lady, let's go.

62
00:08:42,785 --> 00:08:44,683
Xuan, you're the last one again?

63
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,416
You'll be sleeping with the snakes tonight.

64
00:08:46,441 --> 00:08:47,621
You better hurry!

65
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,238
It's Xuan!

66
00:09:25,003 --> 00:09:26,074
You're awake?

67
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,371
Dudou?

68
00:09:32,003 --> 00:09:33,644
How'd you get down there?

69
00:09:33,847 --> 00:09:36,418
What, no snakes again, Xuan?

70
00:09:36,713 --> 00:09:38,207
You want one of mine?

71
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:41,152
A catcher afraid of snakes.

72
00:09:41,238 --> 00:09:43,253
If only your herbs could pay taxes.

73
00:09:43,822 --> 00:09:45,909
Who needs taxes when you can save lives?

74
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,269
Xuan is back!

75
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:48,167
Yay, Xuan!

76
00:09:48,277 --> 00:09:49,385
What did you bring?

77
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,527
Come take a look.

78
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,767
Who wants this one?

79
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:52,613
I want it!

80
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:53,691
Give it to me.

81
00:09:53,716 --> 00:09:54,816
Oh, easy now.

82
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,347
Help.

83
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,980
Help, they're going to eat us.

84
00:10:09,722 --> 00:10:10,972
Young lady.

85
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,394
Xuan, she doesn't remember anything at all.

86
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,425
Hey, miss?

87
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:22,386
Don't worry, I'll take you to where I found you.

88
00:10:22,552 --> 00:10:23,597
There could be clues.

89
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,246
Our snake traps are usually set down there.

90
00:10:31,543 --> 00:10:32,918
Why do you trap snakes?

91
00:10:33,988 --> 00:10:35,707
The world's getting worse and worse

92
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,707
and taxes just keep getting higher.

93
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,949
The General lets us pay them off with snakes.

94
00:10:40,675 --> 00:10:42,418
Which means no forced labor,

95
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:44,833
so we all decided to catch snakes.

96
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:48,875
It's dangerous work, but if you don't do it,

97
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:50,253
things would be worst.

98
00:10:52,214 --> 00:10:54,238
There, it was under that waterfall.

99
00:10:56,644 --> 00:10:58,871
Dudou, I know that's a shortcut

100
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,886
but it's a rough path even for us

101
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,847
and don't forget her.

102
00:11:08,003 --> 00:11:09,089
Dudou!

103
00:11:15,644 --> 00:11:16,375
Huh?

104
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,706
You know magic?

105
00:11:29,918 --> 00:11:31,214
Why don't I go first?

106
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:32,496
You can take your time.

107
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:40,503
Dudou, we ought to follow her, wouldn't you say?

108
00:11:40,812 --> 00:11:41,363
Huh?

109
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:43,675
Dudou?

110
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,386
Go on home then.

111
00:12:25,628 --> 00:12:27,691
I wish I knew magic.

112
00:12:28,738 --> 00:12:30,495
What do you wanna bet you're some kind of immortal?

113
00:12:30,902 --> 00:12:32,027
I don't recall.

114
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:34,375
What is this place?

115
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:36,222
Oh, this is a shack I built.

116
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:38,378
It's usually where I do this and that.

117
00:12:38,642 --> 00:12:39,613
Like dry herbs.

118
00:12:40,132 --> 00:12:42,964
When I'm a doctor, I won't have to catch snakes.

119
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,652
"Hall of Defense?"

120
00:12:45,642 --> 00:12:47,144
Why is it that you call it that?

121
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,003
Huh, oh, this?

122
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:50,830
It's something that I found by the river.

123
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:55,206
Ah, right, so I was making
umbrellas and then I heard Dudou.

124
00:12:55,331 --> 00:12:57,980
I went to look and you were just there on that rock,

125
00:12:58,214 --> 00:12:59,761
floating halfway in the water.

126
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:11,574
Kill the General, even if it costs your life.

127
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:13,339
Master, he's our greatest enemy.

128
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,386
You have our gratitude.

129
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:15,125
I'm not ready.

130
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,083
We have rules,

131
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,191
you can't just act as you please.

132
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:22,714
Did you remember something?

133
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:29,285
Are there things you don't want to do

134
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:30,964
yet you find you have to?

135
00:13:31,292 --> 00:13:34,269
Sure, I don't wanna do lots of things,

136
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,128
but that's what life is.

137
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:40,222
Though naturally I'd rather live it as freely as I can.

138
00:13:41,964 --> 00:13:43,581
That's why I study everything.

139
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:47,167
Medicine, the stars, along with the esoteric arts.

140
00:13:48,636 --> 00:13:52,120
Your fate may be set in stone, how you live isn't.

141
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,847
Spread your power across the land.

142
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:02,667
You okay?

143
00:14:13,785 --> 00:14:14,683
I'm flying.

144
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,636
Hey, I can fly.

145
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,534
Wa-hoo!

146
00:14:22,316 --> 00:14:23,995
Hey, hey, look!

147
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:36,628
This is great, the wind's got us.

148
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,500
Now we're really flying free!

149
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:40,191
Wa-hoo!

150
00:15:37,786 --> 00:15:38,536
Xuan!

151
00:15:39,183 --> 00:15:40,949
I'm fine, I grabbed this.

152
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,417
What is this?

153
00:15:44,214 --> 00:15:45,453
Just focus on climbing.

154
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:46,050
Right.

155
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:54,324
Miss, Miss!

156
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:02,098
No!

157
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,535
Wait, I know her.

158
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,652
Isn't she the assassin the General's after?

159
00:16:19,863 --> 00:16:21,175
She is.

160
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,750
The General, assassin?

161
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:25,269
It could be a trap.

162
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:31,003
Quick, before she wakes up.

163
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,480
Who's there?

164
00:17:15,855 --> 00:17:18,386
That hairpin and I are connected.

165
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:19,464
You're awake.

166
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,988
I think this is magic.

167
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,808
But ll don't know how to use it.

168
00:17:32,324 --> 00:17:33,613
"Precious Jade.”

169
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,816
Wait a second.

170
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:39,003
Precious Jade.

171
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,783
Precious Jade.

172
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,000
Oh, that workshop.

173
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,208
What workshop?

174
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,363
I've heard that it's in an almond
grove just outside of Yongzhou.

175
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,625
And that they craft the finest
wares out of that little workshop.

176
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:58,472
This must be one of theirs, let's go ask them about it.

177
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,995
Xuan, thank you.

178
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,847
Don't trouble yourself though.

179
00:18:04,699 --> 00:18:06,886
Who knows what kind of person I am.

180
00:18:07,816 --> 00:18:10,667
Even if that isn't clear yet, I know this,

181
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:11,980
you're not evil.

182
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,875
We're with the General!

183
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:18,933
Open up!

184
00:18:20,838 --> 00:18:22,671
Everyone come out now.

185
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:24,745
The General?

186
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:28,363
Those two soldiers, we should go.

187
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:53,488
Forgive us, this year, shakes are scarce.

188
00:18:53,613 --> 00:18:56,667
We've done our best.

189
00:18:56,692 --> 00:19:00,136
The world's in chaos and demons are rising.

190
00:19:00,161 --> 00:19:04,500
The General is hard at work honing
his skills to save the country.

191
00:19:04,574 --> 00:19:07,850
Right, demons feast on flesh and show no mercy.

192
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,995
We're truly grateful for the General.

193
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:15,738
However, tonight, I'm here regarding this umbrella.

194
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:17,308
Whose is it?

195
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:21,392
Also is there an unusual woman dressed in white

196
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:22,995
in this village?

197
00:19:23,906 --> 00:19:25,488
Answer him!

198
00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:28,906
Please!

199
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:29,975
Please don't hurt my baby!

200
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,800
Relax, just state the truth and nothing shall happen.

201
00:19:35,105 --> 00:19:37,191
Fine, I'll tell you.

202
00:19:37,253 --> 00:19:38,941
I saw her with Xuan earlier.

203
00:19:39,854 --> 00:19:40,687
My baby!

204
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,242
Search the village.

205
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,250
Yes, sir.

206
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:44,742
Come on.

207
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:45,125
Over here.

208
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:45,882
I'll take this side.

209
00:19:45,906 --> 00:19:46,250
This way!

210
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,792
How much longer do we have to stay in this cave

211
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,027
and live in fear?

212
00:20:03,988 --> 00:20:05,714
It was a crucial task.

213
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:08,425
Our master should've chosen me.

214
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,144
The scout's back!

215
00:20:24,652 --> 00:20:26,683
She really attacked you?

216
00:20:27,081 --> 00:20:30,956
Yes, and she was serious enough that she nearly killed me!

217
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:38,066
And for some reason, the
General's army is racing this way.

218
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:46,259
Master, she's joined the dark forces and betrayed us.

219
00:20:46,284 --> 00:20:49,308
Also, I saw her with a snake catcher.

220
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,377
It looked as if they were fond of each other.

221
00:20:52,402 --> 00:20:52,917
What?

222
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,074
Really?

223
00:21:08,164 --> 00:21:09,644
Master.

224
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:18,019
Don't forget that the mantra I've taught
you all is the very key to mutual strength.

225
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:22,699
This hand flows to the source.

226
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:26,730
United in good and bad.

227
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,894
My thanks, master, to you and everyone.

228
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,706
I am restored.

229
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:37,566
Master, the White Snake has betrayed us all.

230
00:21:37,824 --> 00:21:39,128
That's the...

231
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,066
Master, she would not betray us.

232
00:21:43,316 --> 00:21:44,449
I'll bring her back.

233
00:21:44,691 --> 00:21:47,767
You, we all know how close you two are.

234
00:21:47,792 --> 00:21:50,433
Master, use the Scorching Death Scales.

235
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:51,792
Is she serious?

236
00:21:51,956 --> 00:21:53,175
Is she serious?

237
00:21:57,628 --> 00:22:00,519
Bring her and the hairpin back in three days.

238
00:22:00,761 --> 00:22:04,113
Even I can't save you, should the Scales activate.

239
00:22:04,702 --> 00:22:05,424
Yes.

240
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,808
Chang Pan.

241
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:16,019
And these are the boy's belongings?

242
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:23,628
Notify the General, he should head here.

243
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:24,464
Yes, sir.

244
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:27,792
If I can extract that young lady's energy,

245
00:22:28,175 --> 00:22:32,605
you snake catchers will no longer have any use.

246
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,917
Yongzhou's not far.

247
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:02,644
Still no memory?

248
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:08,542
If I had that issue, I'd have a huge headache.

249
00:23:08,738 --> 00:23:11,519
I just can't imagine not knowing yourself.

250
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,199
Where you've been, what you've done.

251
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:19,995
Then again, there's a lot

252
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,750
that's better off forgotten.

253
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:23,933
Look the wrong way and seasons turn,

254
00:23:24,534 --> 00:23:26,527
our lives are short but sorrows long.

255
00:23:28,113 --> 00:23:31,683
And so, we might as well just focus on the good stuff.

256
00:23:46,386 --> 00:23:49,167
Hey captain, that song of yours is ancient.

257
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:50,589
What dynasty is that from?

258
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:51,886
How about I sing one?

259
00:23:51,911 --> 00:23:53,019
Sure, go ahead.

260
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:02,144
Can't you see

261
00:24:02,614 --> 00:24:06,411
Water's east

262
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:11,129
Flow without a trace

263
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:16,331
Go at their own pace

264
00:24:18,034 --> 00:24:21,510
Can't you see

265
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:25,372
Sun above

266
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:30,247
Sets behind the hills

267
00:24:30,911 --> 00:24:35,676
Rises as it will

268
00:24:36,168 --> 00:24:39,364
No concern

269
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,051
As it gleams

270
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:46,965
This life floats by

271
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:50,497
It's a dream

272
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:54,221
No concern

273
00:24:54,489 --> 00:24:57,721
As it gleams

274
00:24:58,237 --> 00:25:01,417
This life floats by

275
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:05,495
It's a dream

276
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:07,299
Lovely.

277
00:25:08,995 --> 00:25:10,096
It's so true.

278
00:25:10,825 --> 00:25:12,651
It is like a dream.

279
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:15,667
Enjoying life, it's nice.

280
00:25:15,922 --> 00:25:18,940
If you like that song, I'll teach it to you.

281
00:25:20,114 --> 00:25:20,963
All right.

282
00:25:56,612 --> 00:25:57,667
Got it?

283
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,542
Let's sing it together.

284
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:04,417
We might as well, we've got the time.

285
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:19,823
A mysterious girl, mysterious powers.

286
00:26:21,057 --> 00:26:23,167
She could be human or demon.

287
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:24,260
You think you're a demon?

288
00:26:24,926 --> 00:26:26,676
They're all shapes and sizes, sure,

289
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,807
but they're also known to eat people.

290
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,471
How could you be one?

291
00:26:31,817 --> 00:26:33,292
And who cares if you are?

292
00:26:33,721 --> 00:26:35,901
For instance, Dudou.

293
00:26:37,713 --> 00:26:40,182
If he was one, I'd still like the fella

294
00:26:40,323 --> 00:26:42,752
and ll know the reverse is true, right, boy?

295
00:26:43,807 --> 00:26:44,644
Really?

296
00:26:46,292 --> 00:26:47,399
Who says I like you?

297
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:47,708
What?

298
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:50,057
You're just the one who feeds me.

299
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:52,229
Am I talking now?

300
00:26:52,562 --> 00:26:54,151
Woof, woof?

301
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,213
Why am I talking, why am I talking?

302
00:26:58,281 --> 00:26:59,268
I shouldn't be?

303
00:27:01,401 --> 00:27:03,625
Will people think I'm a demon now and kill me?

304
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:04,600
Why does my voice sound like this?

305
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,433
Sh, sh, not so loud.

306
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:06,846
He'll hear you.

307
00:27:06,871 --> 00:27:07,323
I can talk.

308
00:27:09,752 --> 00:27:12,799
Be careful, the river runs fast here!

309
00:27:12,851 --> 00:27:13,986
You'll fall in!

310
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,815
You really are with a human.

311
00:27:51,495 --> 00:27:53,268
Your life is mine!

312
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:01,651
No!

313
00:28:15,077 --> 00:28:15,994
Watch out!

314
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:43,213
Hey.

315
00:29:08,026 --> 00:29:10,252
Xuan, Xuan, why don't we just go?

316
00:29:12,145 --> 00:29:13,643
I'm talking to you.

317
00:29:20,682 --> 00:29:22,612
I really think we should go.

318
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:24,352
Xuan!

319
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:31,971
Stop that!

320
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:33,792
Aren't you scared of snakes?

321
00:29:34,096 --> 00:29:35,837
That's a snake demon, Xuan!

322
00:29:35,862 --> 00:29:36,713
Quiet!

323
00:29:37,198 --> 00:29:38,948
I can't just leave her all alone here.

324
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,042
Do what you like.

325
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:01,245
Dudou, why was he holding me?

326
00:31:01,816 --> 00:31:04,292
You were shivering, cold as ice.

327
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:07,807
Xuan kept you warm, that's why he was holding you.

328
00:31:07,963 --> 00:31:11,948
That brought you around, you
were so cold, you iced up the floor.

329
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:14,127
But we didn't leave you.

330
00:31:33,195 --> 00:31:34,393
There you are.

331
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,338
I was afraid you'd left.

332
00:31:55,616 --> 00:31:56,908
A demon's tail.

333
00:31:58,435 --> 00:31:59,940
I guess I am one.

334
00:32:02,496 --> 00:32:03,663
Does it matter?

335
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,346
The world's full of awful folks without tails.

336
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,190
Who cares if you've got one.

337
00:32:22,792 --> 00:32:24,167
You weren't awful.

338
00:32:48,557 --> 00:32:49,135
No thanks.

339
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:52,526
Good sir, we barely made it to the city with our lives.

340
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:54,127
Do you have any food?

341
00:32:54,152 --> 00:32:56,252
There's so many vagrants around lately.

342
00:32:56,277 --> 00:32:57,745
Let's go, dear.

343
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:00,010
Out of the way!

344
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:01,858
You're all right.

345
00:33:01,882 --> 00:33:02,346
Is she okay?

346
00:33:02,377 --> 00:33:03,417
Don't cry.

347
00:33:07,729 --> 00:33:10,307
Those poor refugees, it's so sad.

348
00:33:11,174 --> 00:33:12,276
They're considered lucky.

349
00:33:12,862 --> 00:33:14,588
Yongzhou is still relatively safe.

350
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:20,065
Huh?

351
00:33:21,713 --> 00:33:22,463
What's wrong?

352
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,026
Oh, it's nothing.

353
00:33:29,489 --> 00:33:30,448
Let's go.

354
00:33:35,862 --> 00:33:36,487
Huh?

355
00:33:38,643 --> 00:33:39,799
You're not alone, you know.

356
00:33:39,824 --> 00:33:42,206
PRECIOUS JADE WORKSHOP

357
00:33:50,456 --> 00:33:51,542
Faster!

358
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:53,418
I think ll was here once.

359
00:33:53,442 --> 00:33:54,862
Position 31.

360
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:56,815
Stop!

361
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:04,424
Ah, we have guests, I see.

362
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:09,833
Oh, you've returned, young lady.

363
00:34:10,085 --> 00:34:11,854
Issues with the wand?

364
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:16,221
Oh, right, we would like to know more about its origin.

365
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:26,690
Hm, do tell.

366
00:34:31,799 --> 00:34:37,042
Though you're human, I detect
the distinct scent of a demon.

367
00:34:40,088 --> 00:34:43,581
Perchance you were cozy with a certain one?

368
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:51,432
Well, regardless, come.

369
00:35:16,885 --> 00:35:20,125
Every demon within 300 li flocks here.

370
00:35:20,182 --> 00:35:23,018
If you require artifacts of the magical sort,

371
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:25,354
come to Precious Jade Workshop,

372
00:35:25,698 --> 00:35:28,627
where all our weapons are of demon quality.

373
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,807
Whoa.

374
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,417
Get to work!

375
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:22,268
This hairpin belonged to another
owner it I recall correctly.

376
00:36:22,737 --> 00:36:28,010
It saps the energy of others and
converts it to its owner's for future use.

377
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,688
Saps energy?

378
00:36:29,849 --> 00:36:30,790
Indeed.

379
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:34,047
This wand has no equal.

380
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:49,917
When young lady was here, you asked for an alteration,

381
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,500
so you could control it.

382
00:36:53,417 --> 00:36:54,024
Good.

383
00:36:55,469 --> 00:36:56,516
Good.

384
00:36:58,711 --> 00:37:00,180
No good!

385
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:03,975
But such changes could create large side effects.

386
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,500
I'll say, she can't recall a thing.

387
00:37:06,727 --> 00:37:07,875
That's the reason why?

388
00:37:08,165 --> 00:37:10,417
Oh, I think you're right.

389
00:37:10,602 --> 00:37:13,649
One's foes do get drained, but then...

390
00:37:16,649 --> 00:37:20,375
It could in all likelihood erase one's memories

391
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:24,946
and without those, what use are magic powers?

392
00:37:25,172 --> 00:37:30,235
Heaven knows, for every gain, there's a loss.

393
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:31,665
Poetic, no?

394
00:37:32,157 --> 00:37:32,958
Yet you...

395
00:37:33,024 --> 00:37:35,102
But young lady was insistent,

396
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,352
you can blame it on this fox's vanity.

397
00:37:38,563 --> 00:37:42,633
These sorts of reversals, changing heaven into earth,

398
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:49,719
evil to good, people to demons,
manipulating that, holds interest to us.

399
00:37:52,422 --> 00:37:54,407
So this hairpin then.

400
00:37:54,708 --> 00:37:56,493
Do you know where its old owner is?

401
00:37:57,805 --> 00:37:59,274
Of course.

402
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:29,024
That's pretty big, isn't it?

403
00:38:30,422 --> 00:38:33,344
It's from one of my kind, though they're clearly stronger.

404
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:35,583
I can tell it's a snake scale.

405
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:36,758
A snake's?

406
00:39:13,196 --> 00:39:14,766
You're a snake catcher!

407
00:39:18,313 --> 00:39:19,704
Blanca!

408
00:39:19,917 --> 00:39:20,716
Blanca!

409
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,542
Blanca!

410
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:22,395
Blanca!

411
00:39:22,419 --> 00:39:23,083
Blanca!

412
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:23,911
Blanca!

413
00:39:23,935 --> 00:39:24,708
Blanca!

414
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,570
Verta.

415
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:28,844
Blanca?

416
00:39:34,531 --> 00:39:35,633
Verta!

417
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,458
You're Verta!

418
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:41,399
I know who I was.

419
00:39:46,102 --> 00:39:48,665
You were given that hairpin and an order.

420
00:39:48,997 --> 00:39:50,586
To kill the General.

421
00:39:52,792 --> 00:39:55,180
You don't recall, sister?

422
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,833
Why does he need snakes?

423
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,446
That swine is using dark kung-fu.

424
00:40:04,532 --> 00:40:06,167
The same that we snakes employ.

425
00:40:06,579 --> 00:40:09,375
He increases his power through feeding on our essence.

426
00:40:10,683 --> 00:40:13,516
Master hates the General and his kind.

427
00:40:13,852 --> 00:40:18,282
She says they're sinister and vicious to the last.

428
00:40:19,054 --> 00:40:20,196
He's different.

429
00:40:21,024 --> 00:40:24,219
When I was lost, with no memory,

430
00:40:25,247 --> 00:40:26,438
he saved me.

431
00:40:27,032 --> 00:40:28,868
Even so, I don't trust him.

432
00:40:29,415 --> 00:40:32,180
So that's what the General's been up to with the snakes.

433
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:35,616
Deceiver! And you catch snakes, killer!

434
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:36,767
I really had no idea.

435
00:40:36,792 --> 00:40:39,313
Death to collaborators!

436
00:40:40,649 --> 00:40:42,172
What's your plan now?

437
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:44,446
Verta, release Xuan.

438
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:47,133
Xuan!

439
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:56,524
A snake catcher like you, so unwilling to leave her side.

440
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,555
You're hiding something.

441
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,184
Verta.

442
00:40:58,208 --> 00:40:59,040
You're a snake?

443
00:40:59,141 --> 00:41:01,808
So hot blooded, not good for your health.

444
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:02,930
You!

445
00:41:04,282 --> 00:41:06,633
Talk, what are you after?

446
00:41:19,836 --> 00:41:22,186
Huh, so you are with the dark forces.

447
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:25,733
I have no idea what that is or
what's going on with this thing.

448
00:41:25,758 --> 00:41:27,930
See, sister, he is with the General.

449
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:32,961
I trust Xuan.

450
00:41:33,813 --> 00:41:34,969
Trust, huh?

451
00:41:38,672 --> 00:41:40,391
I refuse to.

452
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:43,188
The snake catcher is mine!

453
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:52,008
Get up!

454
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,292
Sister, you've forgotten our clan's teachings!

455
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,922
All humans are devious, they are cheats and thieves!

456
00:42:00,235 --> 00:42:02,633
Verta, I don't remember a lot,

457
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,305
only our journey here and he's not those things.

458
00:42:05,383 --> 00:42:06,680
I do remember!

459
00:42:08,133 --> 00:42:08,922
Follow me!

460
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:15,243
Careful.

461
00:42:15,375 --> 00:42:16,391
Could be dangerous.

462
00:42:31,805 --> 00:42:35,790
Oh, who'd have guessed that
this pagoda had a hidden tunnel.

463
00:42:41,313 --> 00:42:42,774
We should find a way out.

464
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,321
Blanca!

465
00:43:21,917 --> 00:43:22,583
Blanca!

466
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:40,946
Bird on a ceiling, tortoise under,

467
00:43:40,971 --> 00:43:43,417
palace within, gate without, eight doors,

468
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:45,250
the door of life, that's it!

469
00:44:05,583 --> 00:44:09,665
Don't worry, you went through the door of life.

470
00:44:21,338 --> 00:44:22,672
What is this place?

471
00:44:23,555 --> 00:44:26,665
It looks like an underground exorcism chamber.

472
00:44:26,991 --> 00:44:28,829
So it should be safe for humans.

473
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:33,680
Still, why is there a Daoist chamber down here?

474
00:44:34,078 --> 00:44:38,735
I guess there was an abandoned temple
and they built the pagoda on top of it.

475
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:45,891
Relax, there should be clues around here, I'll go look.

476
00:44:46,782 --> 00:44:49,321
We will get out, wait here, okay, hm?

477
00:45:05,422 --> 00:45:09,196
Heaven and earth, breath of all life.

478
00:45:09,313 --> 00:45:12,292
Ceaseless honing, magic abounds.

479
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:15,665
Demons wither, monsters shrivel.

480
00:45:16,594 --> 00:45:19,196
Evil expires, drowned by heaven.

481
00:45:28,917 --> 00:45:32,292
Spread your power across the land.

482
00:45:32,555 --> 00:45:35,708
This is a magic weapon, take it

483
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:37,907
and assassinate the General.

484
00:45:41,792 --> 00:45:42,727
Miss?

485
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:50,500
I remember it all.

486
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:56,446
I found the exit, let's go.

487
00:45:57,203 --> 00:45:58,120
Hey Xuan.

488
00:45:59,477 --> 00:46:03,118
Would you say demons are fated to die?

489
00:46:04,078 --> 00:46:06,953
Blanca, you're...

490
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:19,375
Forcing us to catch snakes for the slaughter.

491
00:46:19,542 --> 00:46:21,516
The world is in chaos!

492
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:25,086
And if this goes on, things will get even worse.

493
00:46:27,438 --> 00:46:30,040
Blanca, whatever happens,

494
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:31,891
I'll be there.

495
00:48:10,208 --> 00:48:11,040
Dudou!

496
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:12,875
You.

497
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:19,930
Sister?

498
00:48:20,399 --> 00:48:23,063
Verta, I'll go with you.

499
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:25,333
Sister, you've seen the light?

500
00:48:25,647 --> 00:48:26,906
Where are you going?

501
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,680
Sorry, we need to part ways.

502
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:32,133
Why should we?

503
00:48:32,458 --> 00:48:34,149
The world's heartless.

504
00:48:36,649 --> 00:48:40,555
There are rules here and so many things

505
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:42,633
that I'm forced to do.

506
00:48:43,708 --> 00:48:46,579
You're human, I'm demon.

507
00:48:48,042 --> 00:48:53,024
You said once, there are things that are better forgotten.

508
00:49:02,708 --> 00:49:06,993
It's like you say, the world's
heartless, our paths different.

509
00:49:07,208 --> 00:49:08,961
What we have is real though.

510
00:49:11,778 --> 00:49:13,570
I'll find a way for us.

511
00:49:19,532 --> 00:49:21,133
It won't take long.

512
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:23,055
Wait for me.

513
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:25,594
Dudou.

514
00:49:44,235 --> 00:49:47,579
You're human, if we're together,

515
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:49,766
it'll just hurt you.

516
00:49:53,938 --> 00:49:58,032
Sister, I doubt he'll return, we should go back.

517
00:50:02,901 --> 00:50:04,151
Sister.

518
00:50:05,946 --> 00:50:08,993
We've been together for hundreds of years now.

519
00:50:10,532 --> 00:50:13,500
Things are different though, for him.

520
00:50:24,282 --> 00:50:27,680
We worked so diligently and endured such hardship.

521
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:30,625
Forms such as these aren't easy to attain

522
00:50:30,792 --> 00:50:32,954
nor these lovely faces.

523
00:50:35,062 --> 00:50:37,680
But our true nature will reveal itself.

524
00:50:40,375 --> 00:50:43,790
When it does, will he still find you charming?

525
00:50:47,938 --> 00:50:53,594
Master once said, only humans
know the taste of love and desire.

526
00:50:53,995 --> 00:50:56,672
When I first awoke, I thought I was one.

527
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:03,625
I think the taste of love and desire is overrated.

528
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:07,344
Laying like this, it's like the statue's embracing me.

529
00:51:08,477 --> 00:51:09,719
Isn't this good enough?

530
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:12,500
It's cold though.

531
00:51:19,594 --> 00:51:20,708
Am I cold too?

532
00:51:21,792 --> 00:51:23,333
What's that on you?

533
00:51:24,907 --> 00:51:26,907
It's the Scorching Death Scales.

534
00:51:27,688 --> 00:51:30,829
I promised the master I'd get you back in three days.

535
00:51:31,042 --> 00:51:32,000
If not...

536
00:51:32,157 --> 00:51:35,149
The Death Scales will tear you in two.

537
00:51:35,417 --> 00:51:36,758
Why did you?

538
00:51:37,493 --> 00:51:38,219
Hurry, surround them!

539
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:38,973
Sister.

540
00:51:41,704 --> 00:51:45,040
Yes, young one, I can help you.

541
00:51:45,348 --> 00:51:46,360
You can?

542
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:51,344
You know, I was young once too.

543
00:51:51,391 --> 00:51:53,930
Rather frivolous as well as wild.

544
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:57,758
Even now, I have quite a few regrets.

545
00:52:00,667 --> 00:52:03,391
You should know one day,

546
00:52:03,625 --> 00:52:05,352
you could regret this.

547
00:52:05,461 --> 00:52:07,954
I'll regret things right now
as long as we're not together.

548
00:52:08,921 --> 00:52:11,774
So be it, you are young, aren't you?

549
00:52:12,086 --> 00:52:15,758
Though transactions require an exchange.

550
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:19,149
Can you afford what it will cost?

551
00:52:19,292 --> 00:52:20,961
I'll trade you anything.

552
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:24,305
Good, there is one way.

553
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:26,933
Become a demon.

554
00:52:27,071 --> 00:52:27,860
What?

555
00:52:28,292 --> 00:52:28,958
What do you...

556
00:52:28,983 --> 00:52:31,282
Young one, think.

557
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:35,333
If you're a demon, then you two can stay together.

558
00:52:36,743 --> 00:52:40,958
However, I would need to take your vital essence.

559
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:49,571
Demons such as ourselves require human
vitality to create our magic weapons.

560
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:55,297
The most effective demonic weapons
are forged from this very vitality.

561
00:52:56,118 --> 00:53:01,165
Precious Jade Workshop is renowned for
staying on the leading edge of that front.

562
00:53:02,188 --> 00:53:05,321
If I have to, it's a deal.

563
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:07,917
Good.

564
00:53:10,745 --> 00:53:15,219
However, do you understand the consequences of this?

565
00:53:15,547 --> 00:53:19,458
As a human, you're currently afforded several advantages.

566
00:53:19,531 --> 00:53:21,448
Such as peace and safety.

567
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:24,946
You muddle through life taking it for granted

568
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:29,250
but as one of us, gods, humans and Daoists

569
00:53:29,438 --> 00:53:30,907
will all want to kill you.

570
00:53:30,961 --> 00:53:33,688
Even your own kind will want to kill you.

571
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:37,792
Once I finish taking your vital essence,

572
00:53:37,868 --> 00:53:41,977
you'll be turned into the weakest and smallest of demons.

573
00:53:42,141 --> 00:53:45,829
However hard you try, there will be no advancing.

574
00:53:46,042 --> 00:53:48,368
I understand, do it.

575
00:53:49,208 --> 00:53:51,946
Sure, let's start.

576
00:54:19,583 --> 00:54:23,071
I merely forgot, for this to work,

577
00:54:23,179 --> 00:54:26,227
I still require one ingredient.

578
00:54:27,299 --> 00:54:28,799
What ingredient?

579
00:54:31,024 --> 00:54:32,625
You can't do this!

580
00:54:32,792 --> 00:54:34,083
Let go of him!

581
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:49,125
Hello, we meet again.

582
00:54:49,711 --> 00:54:52,625
That hairpin isn't so fearsome.

583
00:54:52,797 --> 00:54:56,625
You tried to kill my master with such meager power?

584
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:04,750
One of your kind is quite the
valuable thing to Daoists like us.

585
00:55:04,883 --> 00:55:07,125
You're worth 10,000 snakes.

586
00:55:07,292 --> 00:55:08,375
Why you!

587
00:55:08,542 --> 00:55:13,083
Which is why ll informed my master
you were at Snake Catcher Village.

588
00:55:13,258 --> 00:55:16,454
Looking at the hour, he could arrive there soon.

589
00:55:17,458 --> 00:55:20,333
Leaving you two all to me.

590
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,417
There's no reason to share the credit.

591
00:55:23,532 --> 00:55:26,079
Little Daoist, you really are awful,

592
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:28,000
but thanks for the information.

593
00:55:28,221 --> 00:55:29,633
Once we're finished with you,

594
00:55:29,758 --> 00:55:31,583
your master will shortly follow.

595
00:56:13,718 --> 00:56:16,535
So the little Daoist is actually this ugly?

596
00:56:16,766 --> 00:56:18,833
No wonder you wrecked the place.

597
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,208
With all these handsome statues around,

598
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:23,227
you were jealous.

599
00:57:37,118 --> 00:57:40,469
Escaping this net is quite futile, I assure you.

600
00:57:51,417 --> 00:57:52,167
No!

601
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Xuan, Xuan!

602
00:58:09,479 --> 00:58:10,687
You're awake?

603
00:58:11,042 --> 00:58:12,352
Xuan, Xuan!

604
00:58:15,882 --> 00:58:16,632
Xuan!

605
00:58:22,292 --> 00:58:23,758
You still have it.

606
00:58:27,625 --> 00:58:28,708
How are you?

607
00:58:29,224 --> 00:58:29,914
Huh?

608
00:58:38,667 --> 00:58:39,193
Dudou!

609
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:40,375
You have a tail now.

610
00:58:40,459 --> 00:58:41,670
Look!

611
00:58:42,545 --> 00:58:43,625
I'm a demon.

612
00:58:43,792 --> 00:58:44,792
With a tail and everything.

613
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:46,583
Dudou, where's your tail?

614
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:47,943
It's right...

615
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:49,740
Where is it?

616
00:58:49,917 --> 00:58:50,871
This was Dudou's.

617
00:58:50,896 --> 00:58:51,750
It's gone!

618
00:58:52,951 --> 00:58:55,820
Dudou, easy, looks like we're both freaks now.

619
00:58:56,042 --> 00:58:59,084
We'll make the best of it moving forward, together.

620
00:59:02,515 --> 00:59:03,575
Let's go.

621
00:59:07,625 --> 00:59:10,125
Dudou, I can run so fast now!

622
00:59:10,292 --> 00:59:12,125
Too fast, I can't catch up.

623
00:59:30,875 --> 00:59:32,625
Ah, gees!

624
00:59:32,792 --> 00:59:35,772
I'm back, Blanca, and I'm like you now.

625
00:59:37,167 --> 00:59:39,625
Didn't they take your vitality?

626
00:59:39,792 --> 00:59:41,827
You're so fast!

627
00:59:54,167 --> 00:59:56,413
Blanca, Blanca!

628
00:59:57,223 --> 00:59:58,444
Where are you?

629
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:01,583
Blanca!

630
01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:04,077
Xuan, Xuan!

631
01:00:18,093 --> 01:00:21,147
Don't take my powers, don't do it.

632
01:00:21,958 --> 01:00:23,249
I beg you.

633
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,375
Xuan, look at this!

634
01:00:38,875 --> 01:00:40,042
Demons are coming!

635
01:00:40,208 --> 01:00:41,639
Run for your lives!

636
01:00:51,292 --> 01:00:53,458
Demons are coming!

637
01:00:58,749 --> 01:01:00,725
Blanca, Blanca!

638
01:02:05,710 --> 01:02:06,772
Blanca?

639
01:02:12,792 --> 01:02:13,827
Hurry.

640
01:02:47,583 --> 01:02:49,694
Wait, Blanca!

641
01:02:50,132 --> 01:02:50,965
Blanca!

642
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:57,468
It's huge, is that Blanca?

643
01:02:57,493 --> 01:02:59,538
Let's just go, maybe they can turn us back.

644
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:02,583
You really did return.

645
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:05,936
Though Blanca herself has now turned into a giant python.

646
01:03:08,772 --> 01:03:11,163
That Daoist stole her weapon,

647
01:03:11,542 --> 01:03:14,917
but somehow she drained his strength instead.

648
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:16,292
How could that be?

649
01:03:18,991 --> 01:03:21,975
Interesting, you're one of us now.

650
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:26,343
Little one, you scarcely know her.

651
01:03:26,475 --> 01:03:28,624
What kind of connection could you share?

652
01:03:29,335 --> 01:03:33,155
In the end, you just fell for my sister's pretty face.

653
01:03:34,897 --> 01:03:37,718
Now that she has changed into her full demon form,

654
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:39,468
are you still fond of her?

655
01:03:40,827 --> 01:03:41,975
Where is she going?

656
01:03:42,421 --> 01:03:45,639
Snake Catcher Village, little one,

657
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:47,292
you're still in the dark?

658
01:03:47,458 --> 01:03:49,000
The General's there now.

659
01:03:49,639 --> 01:03:51,514
She's looking to settle the score.

660
01:03:51,788 --> 01:03:52,624
He's there?

661
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:57,421
And before too long, that
village will be drowned in tragedy.

662
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:58,750
Our village?

663
01:03:59,499 --> 01:04:00,542
Pick a side.

664
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,085
Xuan, where do we go now?

665
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,479
We're going home.

666
01:04:25,333 --> 01:04:27,375
The General's at Snake Catcher Village?

667
01:04:27,542 --> 01:04:30,077
I saw his fleet, it's gigantic.

668
01:04:30,417 --> 01:04:35,250
My guess is that he already knows
where we're hiding and he's coming for us.

669
01:04:35,417 --> 01:04:36,833
How can he know where we are?

670
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:37,686
Unless there's a...

671
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:43,292
Chang Pan is loyal to us and the Green Snake has
the Death Scales, neither one can be the betrayer.

672
01:04:43,405 --> 01:04:44,792
Maybe it was the White Snake,

673
01:04:44,958 --> 01:04:47,250
she could've joined the General's side.

674
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:53,257
There's clearly a traitor among you!

675
01:04:53,583 --> 01:04:56,042
But we won't wait for them to attack us.

676
01:04:56,327 --> 01:05:00,155
Though we're outnumbered, we'll
take our chances on the front lines.

677
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,382
All of us will attack Snake Catcher Village!

678
01:05:03,583 --> 01:05:05,968
Find the traitor, kill the Daoists!

679
01:05:06,083 --> 01:05:07,413
Crush the village!

680
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:09,238
Find the traitor, kill the Daoists,

681
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:11,167
crush the village, find the traitor,

682
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:14,335
kill the Daoists, crush the village!

683
01:05:17,483 --> 01:05:20,083
Everyone run, the village is in danger!

684
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,421
A giant python is on its way here!

685
01:05:22,583 --> 01:05:24,100
Hurry, stop what you're doing and run!

686
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:25,392
What's gotten into you?

687
01:05:25,475 --> 01:05:26,958
Walls are high here, what are you scared of?

688
01:05:26,983 --> 01:05:29,267
So are Yongzhou's and it was destroyed.

689
01:05:29,405 --> 01:05:31,210
We have to run, there's no time.

690
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,288
Yongzhou's solid stone, pythons, there's no way.

691
01:05:33,313 --> 01:05:35,413
Xuan, you finally returned.

692
01:05:35,458 --> 01:05:37,392
Auntie, you should leave now.

693
01:05:37,417 --> 01:05:39,600
I should, let me tidy up first.

694
01:05:39,625 --> 01:05:40,764
Just go!

695
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,850
The General has arrived.

696
01:06:12,577 --> 01:06:14,608
A giant python.

697
01:06:24,428 --> 01:06:27,093
The truth is that you're a demon.

698
01:06:27,292 --> 01:06:30,749
So how do we know this isn't some demon trick?

699
01:06:30,958 --> 01:06:33,308
General, you should defend the peace,

700
01:06:33,434 --> 01:06:35,309
not invite disaster.

701
01:06:38,167 --> 01:06:39,264
He is a demon.

702
01:06:39,289 --> 01:06:41,042
Yeah, but who really cares?

703
01:06:41,208 --> 01:06:44,850
I'm still Xuan and I still ran here to warn all of you.

704
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:47,303
Yongzhou's in ruins and this place is next.

705
01:06:47,625 --> 01:06:49,491
Listen, you have to run!

706
01:06:50,866 --> 01:06:52,093
You're evil!

707
01:06:54,843 --> 01:06:56,585
Useless little thing.

708
01:06:57,083 --> 01:06:59,663
It's all your fault, you risked our lives,

709
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:01,750
made us catch snakes to feed your power

710
01:07:01,948 --> 01:07:04,198
and forced Blanca to turn into a python!

711
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:13,577
She's here, let me go, I could save us!

712
01:07:13,917 --> 01:07:15,139
Why not?

713
01:07:15,609 --> 01:07:16,651
Go ahead.

714
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:37,051
Blanca!

715
01:07:42,708 --> 01:07:46,069
Blanca, in Yongzhou, you had to face those soldiers.

716
01:07:46,171 --> 01:07:47,343
You didn't want to hurt them,

717
01:07:47,833 --> 01:07:50,077
but up ahead, while they may catch snakes,

718
01:07:50,208 --> 01:07:51,639
they really are all innocent,

719
01:07:51,792 --> 01:07:54,936
so please don't turn the village into a second Yongzhou!

720
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:49,748
Blanca!

721
01:09:02,655 --> 01:09:05,085
Blanca, just listen.

722
01:09:06,333 --> 01:09:08,233
I've been turned into one of you.

723
01:09:09,928 --> 01:09:11,343
Now we're both demons.

724
01:09:14,616 --> 01:09:17,061
Even though you've grown, it doesn't matter.

725
01:09:17,667 --> 01:09:19,375
There's a vast world out there,

726
01:09:19,542 --> 01:09:21,225
full of all kinds of wonders.

727
01:09:21,421 --> 01:09:23,468
So who cares what your body's like.

728
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,499
Blanca, even though I'm the weakest of your kind,

729
01:09:27,792 --> 01:09:29,585
I'll give my all to protect you.

730
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:32,167
And if they won't accept us,

731
01:09:32,264 --> 01:09:34,428
we'll just go to the ends of the Earth.

732
01:09:34,944 --> 01:09:38,366
Our place is out there, we just have to find it.

733
01:09:38,667 --> 01:09:42,639
A pair of demons, together and free.

734
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:47,708
Blanca.

735
01:10:01,208 --> 01:10:01,958
Blanca!

736
01:10:04,083 --> 01:10:04,913
Sister!

737
01:10:23,155 --> 01:10:27,155
Surprising, there was a python after all.

738
01:10:29,507 --> 01:10:32,000
You're to thank for this, little demon.

739
01:10:32,167 --> 01:10:32,833
You!

740
01:10:32,858 --> 01:10:36,038
Without you, I could not have readied this trap.

741
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:47,647
You shall now be extinguished, body and soul.

742
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:01,389
What?

743
01:11:01,583 --> 01:11:02,569
What is this?

744
01:11:03,718 --> 01:11:06,257
It's your essence, your spirit.

745
01:11:06,718 --> 01:11:09,397
Snake catcher, little demon.

746
01:11:09,639 --> 01:11:12,327
He's extinguishing us, body and soul.

747
01:11:12,624 --> 01:11:16,858
Once your soul scatters away, you
won't be able to be reborn again.

748
01:11:16,999 --> 01:11:18,292
It is gone for good.

749
01:11:18,458 --> 01:11:20,583
It's gone for good?

750
01:11:22,375 --> 01:11:27,077
Quite true, sadly, and such a waste now that I hear it.

751
01:11:27,374 --> 01:11:29,889
I prefer having it over losing it.

752
01:11:33,458 --> 01:11:38,750
Once I've perfected my dark powers
and reached a higher state of being,

753
01:11:38,917 --> 01:11:41,875
His Highness will then see what I've achieved.

754
01:11:42,042 --> 01:11:45,655
I hold the secret to immortality.

755
01:11:49,333 --> 01:11:52,625
Immortality, you brag of knowing its secret,

756
01:11:52,749 --> 01:11:56,343
but all you're doing is stealing ours, so do it.

757
01:12:07,624 --> 01:12:09,085
What's this?

758
01:12:10,991 --> 01:12:12,522
That was foolish.

759
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:15,233
You absorbed the Scorching Death Scales.

760
01:12:15,667 --> 01:12:19,022
It's nearly time, they're just about to explode.

761
01:12:33,901 --> 01:12:35,942
Not so difficult.

762
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:45,366
I see this is your doing, witch.

763
01:12:45,667 --> 01:12:47,530
You forced my hand.

764
01:12:47,671 --> 01:12:51,288
Today we're going to settle things once and for all.

765
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:52,569
Master.

766
01:13:44,757 --> 01:13:45,780
Blanca!

767
01:13:51,819 --> 01:13:53,358
Way of fire.

768
01:13:54,553 --> 01:13:55,843
Mountainous earth!

769
01:13:58,249 --> 01:13:59,671
Watch out!

770
01:14:39,811 --> 01:14:41,889
Master, sister!

771
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:46,436
Catch!

772
01:15:36,343 --> 01:15:37,240
Blanca!

773
01:15:41,358 --> 01:15:43,093
Kill them all.

774
01:16:26,956 --> 01:16:28,757
Secure the gate, hold strong!

775
01:16:52,491 --> 01:16:55,608
Master, we've wiped out our greatest enemy today.

776
01:16:55,718 --> 01:16:58,233
Please allow me to return your hairpin now.

777
01:16:59,375 --> 01:17:00,208
Hm.

778
01:17:01,333 --> 01:17:05,561
I allowed your sister to take
this to assassinate that Daoist.

779
01:17:05,875 --> 01:17:10,546
I never thought she'd steal another's
powers or turn into a giant snake.

780
01:17:10,655 --> 01:17:13,671
Master, you have the wrong idea, she really tried to...

781
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:18,733
The Daoist is gone, so ll no longer have any use for this.

782
01:17:20,833 --> 01:17:21,694
Why, master?

783
01:17:22,647 --> 01:17:26,124
The Daoist did such cruel things to us.

784
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:29,796
But one day, it was clear to me,

785
01:17:29,866 --> 01:17:31,833
anything he tried to master...

786
01:17:31,866 --> 01:17:32,198
Sister.

787
01:17:32,222 --> 01:17:33,130
I could too.

788
01:17:33,155 --> 01:17:33,753
Run.

789
01:17:33,777 --> 01:17:37,999
If he could take it, then I can
take your essence just as well!

790
01:17:38,083 --> 01:17:40,538
Sister!

791
01:18:00,958 --> 01:18:02,958
Master!

792
01:18:05,835 --> 01:18:06,668
Blanca!

793
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:12,250
It's fortunate that you have
newly gained strength, little demons.

794
01:18:12,405 --> 01:18:15,132
It's excellent fuel for my own.

795
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:19,933
I'm glad I had the foresight to lend it to you.

796
01:18:20,163 --> 01:18:23,733
All that is shared flows to the source.

797
01:18:25,792 --> 01:18:28,686
It all returns to me!

798
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:05,397
Blanca.

799
01:20:05,682 --> 01:20:06,432
Xuan.

800
01:20:07,475 --> 01:20:10,194
She drained all of the power I had left.

801
01:20:13,135 --> 01:20:14,968
Guess you can't push me away again.

802
01:20:32,882 --> 01:20:34,139
Blanca!

803
01:20:56,038 --> 01:20:56,896
Watch out!

804
01:21:06,708 --> 01:21:07,608
Blanca!

805
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:12,843
Wait, the woman and the net.

806
01:21:13,581 --> 01:21:15,288
Constellations.

807
01:21:17,708 --> 01:21:21,757
There's the heart, the ghost,
southwest horn, chariot, wing.

808
01:21:26,687 --> 01:21:28,725
So the door of life is...

809
01:21:30,561 --> 01:21:31,468
Over there!

810
01:21:58,598 --> 01:21:59,850
What are we waiting for?

811
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:01,835
We have to hurry and save Xuan.

812
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:04,497
We can't go, they're demons, right?

813
01:22:04,522 --> 01:22:07,374
Yeah, and we just saw that the girl in white is too.

814
01:22:08,608 --> 01:22:10,296
It's still Xuan though!

815
01:22:10,436 --> 01:22:12,725
He was once, not now.

816
01:22:12,792 --> 01:22:14,517
That's right, we could've all just died.

817
01:22:14,542 --> 01:22:17,038
I tell ya, if we free those two, it's certain death.

818
01:22:17,264 --> 01:22:18,577
It's just not worth it.

819
01:22:19,147 --> 01:22:21,958
If Xuan didn't save you, you'd be dead now!

820
01:22:21,983 --> 01:22:23,100
Dudou's a demon too!

821
01:22:23,208 --> 01:22:24,083
A dog demon!

822
01:22:24,296 --> 01:22:26,725
And so what, who cares if we're not like you,

823
01:22:26,908 --> 01:22:28,968
we risked our lives to save you!

824
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:44,292
Xuan.

825
01:22:45,208 --> 01:22:46,042
Huh?

826
01:22:58,163 --> 01:23:01,975
All of their souls were drained away.

827
01:23:03,975 --> 01:23:09,788
If we stay, we'll both have
our souls extinguished as well.

828
01:23:21,272 --> 01:23:24,210
Don't worry, the villagers,

829
01:23:24,389 --> 01:23:26,233
they'll save us for sure.

830
01:23:29,583 --> 01:23:30,144
Xuan.

831
01:23:30,168 --> 01:23:31,083
Huh?

832
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:35,625
You said on the river that life is short

833
01:23:35,721 --> 01:23:37,577
and sorrows long.

834
01:23:39,335 --> 01:23:43,458
So we should just focus on the good things.

835
01:23:43,671 --> 01:23:44,421
Right.

836
01:23:45,889 --> 01:23:47,077
Remember,

837
01:23:48,292 --> 01:23:51,593
those dandelions and the ferry?

838
01:23:52,875 --> 01:23:54,389
And that tower?

839
01:23:57,653 --> 01:23:59,061
I can see it all.

840
01:24:04,734 --> 01:24:05,567
You can?

841
01:24:09,292 --> 01:24:10,366
Great.

842
01:24:41,230 --> 01:24:42,366
What's that?

843
01:24:43,417 --> 01:24:45,577
Xuan, listen.

844
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:48,413
Someone's trying to break through.

845
01:24:49,062 --> 01:24:49,895
Xuan?

846
01:24:54,007 --> 01:24:55,218
Xuan, no.

847
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,303
Xuan!

848
01:25:00,984 --> 01:25:01,817
Xuan!

849
01:25:05,725 --> 01:25:06,874
You can't!

850
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:08,405
Please, Xuan.

851
01:25:10,413 --> 01:25:13,835
Didn't you say that we'd leave together?

852
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:20,608
That we'd set out to the ends of
the Earth and see so many places?

853
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:28,936
Don't go!

854
01:25:29,397 --> 01:25:30,764
Don't go!

855
01:25:37,609 --> 01:25:39,491
Please don't, Xuan.

856
01:25:40,042 --> 01:25:42,389
Don't go.

857
01:25:49,163 --> 01:25:52,741
Can't you see

858
01:25:53,167 --> 01:25:57,491
Water's east

859
01:25:58,208 --> 01:26:01,458
Flow without a trace

860
01:26:04,042 --> 01:26:07,000
Go at their own pace

861
01:26:07,146 --> 01:26:11,616
Blanca, whatever happens, I'll be there.

862
01:26:11,655 --> 01:26:12,686
Our lives are short...

863
01:26:12,874 --> 01:26:14,208
And sorrows long.

864
01:26:14,264 --> 01:26:16,792
The world's full of awful folks without tails.

865
01:26:16,827 --> 01:26:17,764
Who cares if you've got one?

866
01:26:17,833 --> 01:26:19,000
Blanca!

867
01:26:19,374 --> 01:26:20,819
It won't take long.

868
01:26:21,875 --> 01:26:22,757
Wait for me.

869
01:26:23,042 --> 01:26:25,061
Your fate may be in stone.

870
01:26:25,928 --> 01:26:27,889
Got it let's sing it together.

871
01:26:28,063 --> 01:26:31,250
The world's heartless, our paths different,
you might as well, we've got the time.

872
01:26:31,327 --> 01:26:33,178
But what we have is real though.

873
01:26:33,375 --> 01:26:35,264
No concerns

874
01:26:35,491 --> 01:26:36,577
No concerns

875
01:26:36,741 --> 01:26:38,178
As it gleams

876
01:26:38,219 --> 01:26:39,850
As it gleams

877
01:26:40,874 --> 01:26:42,534
This life flows by

878
01:26:42,558 --> 01:26:44,530
This life flows by

879
01:26:44,897 --> 01:26:47,358
It's a dream

880
01:26:49,186 --> 01:26:51,835
No concerns

881
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:55,725
As it please

882
01:26:57,176 --> 01:26:59,944
This life floats by

883
01:27:01,358 --> 01:27:02,639
Xuan, no.

884
01:27:02,749 --> 01:27:05,194
It's a dream

885
01:27:46,125 --> 01:27:48,030
Xuan!

886
01:28:02,264 --> 01:28:03,538
Do you see Xuan?

887
01:28:04,555 --> 01:28:05,305
Xuan!

888
01:28:06,569 --> 01:28:07,561
Xuan!

889
01:28:08,330 --> 01:28:09,621
Where are you?

890
01:28:20,585 --> 01:28:24,897
At that last moment, I managed to save his soul.

891
01:28:25,807 --> 01:28:27,182
He's in the hairpin though.

892
01:28:27,311 --> 01:28:30,483
It cost you dearly, you were a shake again.

893
01:28:32,167 --> 01:28:34,593
Using what little strength I had left,

894
01:28:34,833 --> 01:28:37,757
I sealed the memories of what occurred into this.

895
01:28:40,145 --> 01:28:43,710
Today you've unlocked it as last.

896
01:28:49,397 --> 01:28:55,522
Even if I did, immortality is something I can't reach.

897
01:28:56,153 --> 01:28:57,952
It hasn't freed you?

898
01:29:00,077 --> 01:29:04,030
That second of joy, held for 500 years.

899
01:29:04,494 --> 01:29:05,577
Was it worth it?

900
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:11,546
Even if it cost 1,000 years, it was worth it.

901
01:29:22,375 --> 01:29:24,093
I'll always be with you.

902
01:29:30,875 --> 01:29:33,593
Xuan, where is he?

903
01:29:34,171 --> 01:29:37,069
His soul survived and reincarnated,

904
01:29:37,208 --> 01:29:38,702
it's out there somewhere.

905
01:29:42,252 --> 01:29:43,600
I have to find it.

906
01:29:46,085 --> 01:29:50,678
Whoever he is now, he's already
lived through so many lifetimes.

907
01:29:51,038 --> 01:29:54,850
Even if you do find him, he may not be how you remember.

908
01:30:02,725 --> 01:30:04,686
Wherever he is in the world,

909
01:30:05,632 --> 01:30:07,475
whatever he looks like,

910
01:30:09,678 --> 01:30:14,139
whether he remembers me or not, I have to find him.

911
01:30:17,083 --> 01:30:20,803
After all, I remember.

912
01:30:42,875 --> 01:30:43,936
Hey, wait!

913
01:30:44,335 --> 01:30:45,375
Wait, wait.

914
01:30:45,542 --> 01:30:47,750
Wait a second, hold up!

915
01:30:50,631 --> 01:30:52,982
Honestly, you're so forgetful.

916
01:30:54,208 --> 01:30:55,375
Thank you, brother.

917
01:30:55,542 --> 01:30:57,583
Yeah, yeah, you're oh your own.

918
01:30:58,958 --> 01:31:01,171
He seems to have time now.

919
01:31:05,875 --> 01:31:06,708
Hm?

920
01:31:17,536 --> 01:31:18,370
Excuse me.

921
01:31:21,606 --> 01:31:22,670
Miss.

922
01:31:24,061 --> 01:31:25,139
Miss.

923
01:31:25,333 --> 01:31:26,796
You dropped your hairpin.

924
01:31:37,792 --> 01:31:39,022
Thank you, sir.

925
01:31:43,958 --> 01:31:45,632
It looks very old.

926
01:31:45,875 --> 01:31:47,198
Is it valuable?

927
01:31:47,222 --> 01:31:48,042
It is.

928
01:31:48,208 --> 01:31:49,874
Thank you again for picking it up.

929
01:31:50,042 --> 01:31:51,733
I'd really hate to lose it.

930
01:31:52,912 --> 01:31:54,936
You seem like a lady of good standing.

931
01:31:55,171 --> 01:31:56,468
Where are you from?

932
01:31:57,366 --> 01:31:59,350
That's a long story.

933
01:35:16,958 --> 01:35:20,796
Why does

934
01:35:21,625 --> 01:35:26,280
Spring hurry like so

935
01:35:28,458 --> 01:35:32,757
It brings the wind

936
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:37,702
And galloping rain

937
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:42,303
Though spring

938
01:35:43,292 --> 01:35:47,991
Does not grow old

939
01:35:49,417 --> 01:35:53,475
We feel

940
01:35:53,667 --> 01:35:57,155
That it may

941
01:36:14,792 --> 01:36:18,500
Yet this is

942
01:36:18,667 --> 01:36:23,311
A worldly fear

943
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:35,210
Did you find what I was looking for?
