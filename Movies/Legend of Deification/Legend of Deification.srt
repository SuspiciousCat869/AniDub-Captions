1
00:01:27,912 --> 00:01:30,184
In the last years of the Shang Dynasty,

2
00:01:30,303 --> 00:01:32,861
Emperor Zhou became a fatuous tyrant.

3
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:39,241
Seeing an opportunity, The Fox Devil, Nine Tailed,
transformed herself into Daji, the Royal Consort

4
00:01:39,423 --> 00:01:41,267
and took control of the government.

5
00:01:41,565 --> 00:01:44,293
The Fox clan brought chaos to the world.

6
00:01:44,936 --> 00:01:46,629
Heaven took pity on the people.

7
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,524
When at last they rebelled,

8
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:52,216
the Master of Jingxu Hall sent divine reinforcement.

9
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,744
Thus the Three Realms were engulfed in war.

10
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,177
Jingxu Hall's foremost disciple, Jiang Ziya,

11
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:17,481
set forth to vanquish Nine Tailed once and for all.

12
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,808
My love, what have you done?

13
00:02:23,928 --> 00:02:25,543
Where are you?

14
00:02:28,745 --> 00:02:30,167
Enough! Stop this at once!

15
00:02:32,446 --> 00:02:34,235
Jiang Ziya.

16
00:02:35,453 --> 00:02:37,008
Aah...

17
00:02:44,002 --> 00:02:47,034
Your illusions do not frighten me, Fox Devil!

18
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:51,533
We have the same goal, do we not?

19
00:02:52,263 --> 00:02:55,719
Must we quarrel over a single, pitiful dynasty?

20
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,710
It is mankind's destiny to serve the Fox Clan forever!

21
00:03:04,888 --> 00:03:06,904
I invoke the Suppressing Seal!

22
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:08,805
Malignant spirits.

23
00:03:08,926 --> 00:03:10,531
Be vanquished!

24
00:03:54,926 --> 00:03:56,546
The war came to an end.

25
00:03:57,173 --> 00:04:00,478
For its victory over Emperor Zhou, Jingxu Hall was lauded.

26
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:06,500
The Revered Master bequeathed unto the people
gods tasked with the protection of all living things.

27
00:04:07,756 --> 00:04:11,173
With the rise of a new Dynasty, there was much to be done.

28
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:17,297
Those loyal to the old order were banished
to the icy ruins of Beihai, never to return.

29
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:31,813
For his role in the triumph,

30
00:04:31,948 --> 00:04:34,919
Jiang Ziya was celebrated far and wide.

31
00:04:35,283 --> 00:04:37,866
It was thought he would lead the new gods.

32
00:04:39,031 --> 00:04:40,169
And yet...

33
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:10,664
What'd I say?

34
00:05:11,096 --> 00:05:12,936
Why is that rock shaped so weird?

35
00:05:13,817 --> 00:05:16,306
When's the last time you've ever seen a rock around here?

36
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:17,433
I'm gonna take a look.

37
00:05:17,486 --> 00:05:18,385
Freeze!

38
00:05:20,406 --> 00:05:22,128
Things aren't... Whoa!

39
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:24,714
Uh...

40
00:05:26,068 --> 00:05:26,784
Ugh...

41
00:05:28,183 --> 00:05:31,105
That's no rock. It's one of the Immortals.

42
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,114
Immortals?

43
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:34,926
Behold. Following the Great War,

44
00:05:35,037 --> 00:05:37,660
Jingxu Hall let down a stairway to heaven

45
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,804
and invited mankind to ascend.

46
00:05:40,752 --> 00:05:44,946
The first person to climb it was
none other than Jiang Ziya himself.

47
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:47,624
That's how he became a god.

48
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,697
I have completed the mission given to me.

49
00:06:41,674 --> 00:06:43,207
Jiang Ziya.

50
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:47,416
The Fox Devil you have subdued
cannot be permitted to live.

51
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:50,078
As the Three Realms look on.

52
00:06:50,197 --> 00:06:54,010
Nine Tailed must be executed. By you.

53
00:06:54,108 --> 00:06:58,721
With this act shall you secure
your place as leader of the gods.

54
00:06:58,816 --> 00:07:00,851
As you are a servant of the people,

55
00:07:00,946 --> 00:07:06,233
so shall the disciples of Jingxu Hall be
yours to command in upholding Heaven's will.

56
00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:07,458
Then so it is done.

57
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:51,976
Kill her!

58
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:53,162
Kill her!

59
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:53,800
Kill her!

60
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:54,551
Kill her!

61
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:55,536
Kill her!

62
00:07:58,618 --> 00:08:22,436
Kill!

63
00:08:32,524 --> 00:08:35,474
Nine Tailed. These illusions are fruitless.

64
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,644
Your fate is sealed. This is how you end.

65
00:08:40,907 --> 00:08:42,592
So loyal.

66
00:08:42,718 --> 00:08:46,779
What right does your Master
have to presume the will of Heaven?

67
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:49,099
He has saved mankind from your evildoing.

68
00:08:49,171 --> 00:08:51,228
Has he indeed?

69
00:08:51,988 --> 00:08:52,625
Uh...

70
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:56,543
Very well.

71
00:08:57,617 --> 00:09:01,214
Why does he not move to save her?

72
00:09:03,108 --> 00:09:04,010
Who is that?

73
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:06,792
You know nothing of the truth.

74
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,796
This girl, she's...

75
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:11,026
Jiang Ziya!

76
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:15,583
Do not let her sow the seeds of doubt in your mind!

77
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:17,190
Kill her!

78
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:21,243
Prepare to meet your end!

79
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:39,142
Kill!

80
00:09:39,654 --> 00:09:47,904
Kill!

81
00:09:48,626 --> 00:09:49,605
Look out!

82
00:09:50,607 --> 00:09:52,282
Her sorcery!

83
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:03,723
Resist the illusion! Stay pure!

84
00:10:14,687 --> 00:10:17,255
See me! Take off the mask!

85
00:10:19,983 --> 00:10:20,966
Huh?

86
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,232
Mark my words, you will be executed!

87
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:29,733
If I die,

88
00:10:30,587 --> 00:10:32,439
she dies.

89
00:10:40,004 --> 00:10:41,290
Save me.

90
00:10:46,508 --> 00:10:49,235
Master, there is an innocent in her clutches!

91
00:10:53,617 --> 00:10:55,082
Huh! No, wait!

92
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,550
Let her go!

93
00:11:30,478 --> 00:11:31,216
Uh...

94
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,774
Come on! Get it together!

95
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,521
It's been long enough!

96
00:11:35,815 --> 00:11:37,095
I want to go home!

97
00:11:42,837 --> 00:11:46,819
You have undone the seal. You must be punished.

98
00:11:46,844 --> 00:11:49,179
But I saw an innocent spirit within Nine Tailed.

99
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:50,149
Silence!

100
00:11:50,304 --> 00:11:52,858
What you saw was a conjuring trick!

101
00:11:52,883 --> 00:11:53,789
But is seemed so...

102
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:56,487
Were Nine Tailed loose in the mortal realm...

103
00:11:56,693 --> 00:12:00,135
The devastations of the great
war would have been for naught.

104
00:12:00,237 --> 00:12:03,702
Fortunately, the Fox Devil has been executed.

105
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:07,588
But you are hereby banished from Jingxu Hall!

106
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,283
I know what I saw.

107
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:13,482
Jiang Ziya.

108
00:12:14,387 --> 00:12:15,142
Master.

109
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:19,363
I have no choice but to seal your divine power

110
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:25,446
and exile you to Beihai until such time as you
are no longer in thrall to this wicked illusion.

111
00:12:25,763 --> 00:12:28,196
Only then may you return.

112
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:34,187
This job stinks.

113
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:37,412
Emperor Zhou gets to be the God of Marriage, but me?

114
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,957
I'm stuck looking after you. I'm a baby sitter!

115
00:12:41,656 --> 00:12:43,592
Ah! Four-Alike?

116
00:12:43,718 --> 00:12:46,624
No! That's for the three of us to share!

117
00:12:46,688 --> 00:12:50,394
Oh, I see how it is! You wanna bite me! Fine!

118
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,647
Huh!

119
00:12:52,858 --> 00:12:54,335
With a straight hook?

120
00:12:54,996 --> 00:12:56,782
This fish is as dumb as you are.

121
00:12:58,219 --> 00:13:02,993
What... Oh! You've got to be kidding me. Unbelievable.

122
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:06,201
Look at you.

123
00:13:06,576 --> 00:13:09,524
They get to go home, meanwhile we're rooted to the spot!

124
00:13:11,663 --> 00:13:12,671
I'll do it!

125
00:13:15,564 --> 00:13:16,952
Uh... Wha...

126
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:19,034
I'll break this thing into splinters!

127
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:22,870
Don't test me! Humph!

128
00:13:24,924 --> 00:13:25,399
Stop!

129
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,933
Do you want to go back to Jingxu Hall or not?

130
00:13:29,071 --> 00:13:31,509
Come on! It was all in your head!

131
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,888
Um... Nine Tailed played a trick on you.

132
00:13:37,111 --> 00:13:40,137
It's like that saying about
flies only going for cracked eggs.

133
00:13:40,248 --> 00:13:42,733
Not that I'm, you know, calling you an egg or anything...

134
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:43,629
Go home.

135
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:44,445
Huh?

136
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:45,803
You deserve better.

137
00:13:46,722 --> 00:13:48,347
It's been ten years.

138
00:13:49,436 --> 00:13:50,815
This is my punishment.

139
00:13:53,894 --> 00:13:54,771
Ugh...

140
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:10,598
You're a damn fool.

141
00:14:11,965 --> 00:14:13,895
If it weren't for the Master's orders,

142
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:15,760
I'd be long gone.

143
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,530
Four-Alike.

144
00:14:22,424 --> 00:14:23,388
Huh?

145
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,191
I've got one eye.

146
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,316
Two big mouths.

147
00:15:32,387 --> 00:15:33,149
Three whole arms.

148
00:15:33,268 --> 00:15:34,687
And four legs!

149
00:15:34,728 --> 00:15:35,913
You lose!

150
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:37,407
Look at these beauties!

151
00:15:37,432 --> 00:15:37,873
What?

152
00:15:37,897 --> 00:15:38,637
Drink!

153
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,571
Bunch of morons.

154
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:46,455
What? You filthy urchin!

155
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:47,008
Mommy!

156
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:47,957
 Get back here!

157
00:15:47,982 --> 00:15:48,926
He's bullying me!

158
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:52,000
Which one of you lowlifes is picking
on my child? I'll rip you apart!

159
00:15:52,025 --> 00:15:53,557
Excuse me?

160
00:15:53,626 --> 00:15:55,936
Oh, oh...

161
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:56,766
Oh.

162
00:15:59,207 --> 00:16:01,861
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

163
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,498
It burns!

164
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,629
Stinking devils always causing trouble.

165
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:08,621
Confiscate their weapons!

166
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,642
Cowards! Nine Tailed would'a killed ya if you hadn't fled!

167
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:14,653
She'd have taken you lot first!

168
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:16,217
She can smell fear!

169
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:17,828
Says the one who reeks of it!

170
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,042
Jiang Ziya?

171
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,678
Why is he here?

172
00:16:25,957 --> 00:16:27,402
Killjoy.

173
00:16:42,483 --> 00:16:43,514
Hmm... Huh...

174
00:16:50,148 --> 00:16:51,483
Oh-oh!

175
00:16:51,508 --> 00:16:55,002
If it isn't the big shot immortal
who got us all imprisoned here! Huh?

176
00:16:56,693 --> 00:16:57,610
Excuse me.

177
00:16:58,213 --> 00:16:59,736
Humph. Well, hey!

178
00:16:59,761 --> 00:17:02,691
At least we're all in this together.
Gotta be worse for you, though!

179
00:17:02,762 --> 00:17:04,860
Scum of the Three Realms ousted from Jingxu Hall!

180
00:17:04,885 --> 00:17:06,258
Oh, that's a good one!

181
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,022
The scum of the Three Realms!

182
00:17:08,086 --> 00:17:10,794
Scum!

183
00:17:10,861 --> 00:17:11,938
- You hear that?

184
00:17:12,716 --> 00:17:14,158
So what if you won the war?

185
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:16,325
You're still stuck here with all of us!

186
00:17:16,904 --> 00:17:18,834
Barkeep. How much for rice?

187
00:17:22,377 --> 00:17:23,655
My, my.

188
00:17:23,705 --> 00:17:26,134
What a rare treat this is.

189
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:29,420
Beihai is on a barter system.

190
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:33,283
The Whip of the Gods would suffice!

191
00:17:34,193 --> 00:17:35,512
What about this?

192
00:17:35,952 --> 00:17:36,737
Hmm...

193
00:17:37,575 --> 00:17:39,436
Kunlun moire.

194
00:17:41,034 --> 00:17:46,244
Your, associate Shen Gongbao was
here earlier, weeping himself silly.

195
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:49,588
Ah. Poor fellow. Forced to trade his earring.

196
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,275
Did you two have a spat?

197
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:56,238
Oh now, don't take it to heart.

198
00:17:56,835 --> 00:17:57,515
Ha!

199
00:17:59,831 --> 00:18:02,575
Life squeezes us one way or another.

200
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:07,584
Get over it and move on, or
lay down arms and accept defeat.

201
00:18:10,221 --> 00:18:15,592
Sometimes, the only thing standing between
us and what we want is admitting we're wrong.

202
00:18:15,665 --> 00:18:18,485
What you saw was a conjuring trick!

203
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:28,609
Well. Someone likes making an entrance.

204
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:40,154
Step aside.

205
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,204
You're a new face.

206
00:18:42,305 --> 00:18:46,287
Tell me, girl, are you looking for
someone in particular or just trouble?

207
00:18:49,552 --> 00:18:50,538
Just trouble.

208
00:18:50,918 --> 00:18:52,246
Is that a fact?

209
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,497
Okay, okay! You win!

210
00:18:56,616 --> 00:18:57,660
She's good.

211
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,477
Strong little one, eh?

212
00:19:06,451 --> 00:19:07,174
Huh?

213
00:19:12,454 --> 00:19:14,607
I'm looking for a place.

214
00:19:15,107 --> 00:19:15,774
It's her.

215
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,793
Yeah? And what "place" might that be, missy?

216
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,526
Somewhere very unique.

217
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,942
Where the black flowers bloom.

218
00:19:24,211 --> 00:19:25,386
Black flowers?

219
00:19:25,411 --> 00:19:27,934
Yeah, sorry. Not ringin' a bell.

220
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:28,563
You seen anything like that before?

221
00:19:28,588 --> 00:19:33,837
Interesting. There is only one
such place in the Three Realms.

222
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:35,783
Mount Youdu,

223
00:19:36,044 --> 00:19:39,024
the traveler's despair!

224
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:42,403
You know what I'm talking about? Where is it? Tell me!

225
00:19:43,062 --> 00:19:43,861
Hmm.

226
00:19:43,944 --> 00:19:45,789
Don't smirk. I know the score.

227
00:19:46,908 --> 00:19:50,175
Youdu was once a sacred mountain not so long ago.

228
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:55,291
It's where Emperor Zhou was given the title
"God of Marriage”. Oh, how times have changed.

229
00:19:55,656 --> 00:19:57,626
Strange things are afoot.

230
00:19:57,651 --> 00:19:58,325
Black flowers thrive unchecked

231
00:19:58,325 --> 00:20:03,855
along the mountainside, hiding the
path. All who search for it miss the mark.

232
00:20:03,964 --> 00:20:07,033
Ah, but lucky for you I just so happen to have a map.

233
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:10,728
And of course, much more besides.

234
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,398
I trade in rare beasts, souvenirs,
travel essentials... Everything!

235
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,122
Yes.

236
00:20:17,241 --> 00:20:20,531
There sits Mount Youdu, in all its glory!

237
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:21,299
Let me see!

238
00:20:21,323 --> 00:20:22,280
Not so fast!

239
00:20:22,828 --> 00:20:27,651
Just the other day, a group of downtrodden
fox hunters tried to haggle for this item.

240
00:20:28,151 --> 00:20:32,909
If one credits their word, the
mountain is haunted, by Fox Devils!

241
00:20:34,324 --> 00:20:35,418
But.. weren't they driven to extinction?

242
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:36,923
If the Fox Devils have returned,

243
00:20:37,074 --> 00:20:38,789
the Three Realms will be thrown into chaos!

244
00:20:38,814 --> 00:20:40,799
Such a young thing you are.

245
00:20:40,855 --> 00:20:44,183
What business can you have with so frightful a place?

246
00:20:44,587 --> 00:20:47,853
That's none of your concern.
Is the map for sale or isn't it?

247
00:20:47,885 --> 00:20:49,617
I appreciate your fire.

248
00:20:49,671 --> 00:20:54,963
But the first rule of negotiation dictates
that all goods are subject to inspection!

249
00:20:58,779 --> 00:20:59,748
You stay out of this!

250
00:20:59,773 --> 00:21:01,711
What sort of despicable operation are you...

251
00:21:04,713 --> 00:21:06,151
You tried to trick me!

252
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:07,176
Meddler.

253
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:13,349
What are you doing?

254
00:21:13,374 --> 00:21:14,826
Grab the wretch!

255
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:16,450
What the?

256
00:21:16,823 --> 00:21:18,156
My inventory!

257
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,707
My Jingxu divination stone!

258
00:21:34,768 --> 00:21:36,319
No! Wait!

259
00:21:36,344 --> 00:21:39,199
That's immortal wine! I've been saving it for years!

260
00:21:39,224 --> 00:21:42,222
You don't say? Well, then... It's worth sharing!

261
00:21:43,841 --> 00:21:44,318
Huh?

262
00:21:44,788 --> 00:21:45,197
Hey!

263
00:21:46,351 --> 00:21:47,191
Wait I don't...

264
00:21:47,216 --> 00:21:48,727
Someone stop her!

265
00:21:49,005 --> 00:21:49,800
Hands off!

266
00:21:50,124 --> 00:21:51,761
I'll offer a reward!

267
00:21:53,788 --> 00:21:54,716
The map!

268
00:21:57,165 --> 00:21:58,320
Someone catch it!

269
00:21:58,344 --> 00:21:59,643
Get the wine!

270
00:22:01,437 --> 00:22:03,967
That's a good boy. Just hand me the map.

271
00:22:05,101 --> 00:22:06,056
No, no, no!

272
00:22:06,103 --> 00:22:06,835
Spit it out!

273
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,282
Spit it out right now!

274
00:22:08,803 --> 00:22:09,870
Kill her if you have to!

275
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:11,661
Leave her be!

276
00:22:12,683 --> 00:22:16,123
Ugh! Very well! I'll do it myself!

277
00:22:24,848 --> 00:22:26,115
Fox!

278
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:41,673
Devil!

279
00:22:42,953 --> 00:22:46,128
If we hand her over to Jingxu
Hall, we're as good as freed!

280
00:22:46,153 --> 00:22:47,384
None of you get in my way!

281
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,427
Be careful! They'll want the head intact!

282
00:22:57,566 --> 00:22:58,321
Down there!

283
00:22:58,346 --> 00:22:59,370
I see her!

284
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,613
Don't let her get away!

285
00:23:06,868 --> 00:23:08,005
Hurry!

286
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:13,065
Huh?

287
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,045
Where do you think you're going?

288
00:23:17,594 --> 00:23:18,218
Stop!

289
00:23:18,242 --> 00:23:18,863
Huh?

290
00:23:18,935 --> 00:23:19,774
What is...

291
00:23:20,991 --> 00:23:21,774
Who are you?

292
00:23:29,629 --> 00:23:31,832
Jiang Ziya! Slow down!

293
00:23:31,934 --> 00:23:34,022
You're about to cross the boundary!

294
00:23:44,082 --> 00:23:45,536
Good thing I can keep up.

295
00:23:46,052 --> 00:23:47,189
If you'd left Beihai,

296
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:49,373
you'd be in defiance of the Master.

297
00:23:52,668 --> 00:23:54,411
Look, all that stuff I said earlier.

298
00:23:54,628 --> 00:23:55,982
I'm just trying to help!

299
00:23:56,531 --> 00:23:58,459
Hey, whoa! Whoa! Don't do it!

300
00:24:00,131 --> 00:24:04,318
I can only return to Jingxu
Hall... by first uncovering the truth.

301
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:07,676
Huh? Please! Be reasonable!

302
00:24:08,176 --> 00:24:11,801
Ah! He's starved. He's not thinking clearly.

303
00:24:12,003 --> 00:24:13,620
Uh... Okay.

304
00:24:13,778 --> 00:24:15,701
If I have to cross, then so be...

305
00:24:18,873 --> 00:24:20,812
Jiang Ziya's out of his mind.

306
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,293
It's freezing. Get him inside.

307
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:28,600
Ha! He's in league with the Fox Devil!

308
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:56,284
Huh?

309
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,167
Huh!

310
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,958
Who are you?

311
00:25:18,807 --> 00:25:19,712
Give that back!

312
00:25:26,196 --> 00:25:29,222
Speak. What is your connection to Nine Tailed?

313
00:25:31,804 --> 00:25:34,429
How far the mighty Jiang Ziya has fallen.

314
00:25:34,912 --> 00:25:37,488
Treating an innocent little girl like a common hoodlum.

315
00:25:37,513 --> 00:25:38,468
Oh, save it!

316
00:25:38,492 --> 00:25:39,740
Murderer!

317
00:25:42,867 --> 00:25:44,722
So much for being an immortal.

318
00:25:44,865 --> 00:25:46,804
Are all of you this unreasonable?

319
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:49,600
If anyone's connected to the Fox Devil, it's you.

320
00:25:50,578 --> 00:25:52,302
So that bracelet?

321
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:53,731
Is none of your business!

322
00:25:53,755 --> 00:25:56,419
It belonged to Nine Tailed. Why are you wearing it?

323
00:25:57,074 --> 00:25:58,397
What are you talking about?

324
00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:03,507
It belongs to me!

325
00:26:04,593 --> 00:26:05,343
Stop!

326
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:14,453
Nine Tailed!

327
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:31,416
No!

328
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,697
Spirit-taming fires, rise!

329
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,967
What were those?

330
00:26:55,136 --> 00:26:56,356
What do they want with you?

331
00:26:58,162 --> 00:26:59,534
Excellent question.

332
00:26:59,865 --> 00:27:01,330
How the hell should I know?

333
00:27:01,355 --> 00:27:03,332
They've been after me from the moment I woke up.

334
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:04,832
There's more every time.

335
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:09,626
I'm guessing it has to do with my past.

336
00:27:09,815 --> 00:27:10,942
I don't really know.

337
00:27:11,557 --> 00:27:15,026
The only clue is this bracelet,
and the memory of black flowers.

338
00:27:20,838 --> 00:27:21,897
Mount Youdu.

339
00:27:22,436 --> 00:27:25,289
Sometimes I can see my father.

340
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:28,824
Waiting for me. He can prove I'm not a devil!

341
00:27:30,296 --> 00:27:33,324
Do not let her sow the seeds of doubt.

342
00:27:33,324 --> 00:27:35,554
You're coming with me to Jingxu Hall!

343
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,546
Are you listening?

344
00:27:36,628 --> 00:27:38,197
I have to find my father!

345
00:27:40,111 --> 00:27:42,611
He has saved mankind from your evildoing.

346
00:27:42,699 --> 00:27:45,240
You know nothing of the truth.

347
00:27:46,908 --> 00:27:51,820
I have no choice but to seal your
divine power and exile you to Beihai

348
00:27:51,845 --> 00:27:56,228
until such time as you are no longer
in thrall to this wicked illusion.

349
00:28:04,503 --> 00:28:05,458
What is this?

350
00:28:05,971 --> 00:28:06,912
Who are you?

351
00:28:17,327 --> 00:28:18,535
Very well.

352
00:28:25,139 --> 00:28:25,997
Let's go.

353
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:28,022
Where?

354
00:28:28,348 --> 00:28:29,548
To Mount Youdu.

355
00:28:30,329 --> 00:28:31,860
Wait, are you serious?

356
00:28:33,966 --> 00:28:35,554
Yes. Are you afraid?

357
00:28:36,449 --> 00:28:38,009
A-Afraid?

358
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,501
What kind of question is that?

359
00:28:40,216 --> 00:28:42,863
And don't act all high and mighty, it's my map!

360
00:28:43,527 --> 00:28:44,865
Hey, wait up!

361
00:29:01,826 --> 00:29:03,146
That hasn't healed yet?

362
00:29:03,194 --> 00:29:05,095
I have something that might help.

363
00:29:05,186 --> 00:29:06,525
My secret recipe!

364
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:10,728
It's yours. If you give me a peek at the map.

365
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:14,016
I thought we were friends!

366
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:15,560
I wasn't aware we'd graduated to that.

367
00:29:15,585 --> 00:29:17,387
Whatever, it's only a matter of time.

368
00:29:17,474 --> 00:29:19,094
We just have to get to know each other.

369
00:29:19,192 --> 00:29:20,523
Good idea.

370
00:29:20,864 --> 00:29:21,957
Let's start with you.

371
00:29:21,982 --> 00:29:22,414
Huh?

372
00:29:22,826 --> 00:29:24,069
You're not an immortal.

373
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,782
So how did you cross into Beihai?

374
00:29:26,782 --> 00:29:27,055
Uh...

375
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:30,000
That's kind of personal.

376
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,528
Are you normally this blunt?

377
00:29:31,553 --> 00:29:32,012
Uh...

378
00:29:32,892 --> 00:29:34,522
Why I should even trust you?

379
00:29:34,699 --> 00:29:36,272
You're dressed like a vagrant.

380
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:37,907
A desperate vagrant.

381
00:29:38,045 --> 00:29:40,251
For all I know you see me as a bounty.

382
00:29:40,574 --> 00:29:40,957
Huh?

383
00:29:42,938 --> 00:29:43,904
Ah!

384
00:29:46,879 --> 00:29:50,000
And you see me as a mark. Uh, wait!

385
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:54,551
Okay, okay, okay.

386
00:30:00,892 --> 00:30:03,086
You're so arrogant! That tone.

387
00:30:04,606 --> 00:30:05,786
Four-Alike, that's enough.

388
00:30:06,335 --> 00:30:07,302
Four-Alike?

389
00:30:08,324 --> 00:30:12,395
So this is the legendary creature
said to move with such grace?

390
00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:15,748
Fearsome? Big as the night sky? Makes men tremble?

391
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:18,473
How adorable.

392
00:30:22,934 --> 00:30:24,268
Don't antagonize.

393
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:26,529
It left Jingxu Hall on my account.

394
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,271
Oh sure. Sounds like a reasonable story.

395
00:30:31,407 --> 00:30:33,480
Or maybe it just couldn't cut it in Heaven.

396
00:30:35,407 --> 00:30:37,299
Give that back! I was kidding!

397
00:30:37,324 --> 00:30:37,977
Four-Alike!

398
00:30:38,088 --> 00:30:40,606
Hey, tough guy! How 'bout you control your pet?

399
00:30:42,051 --> 00:30:44,341
Ugh! I'll slap a muzzle on that face!

400
00:30:45,986 --> 00:30:47,537
Get back here!

401
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:12,062
All right, fun's over!

402
00:31:13,683 --> 00:31:15,043
Don't you even!

403
00:31:15,478 --> 00:31:16,677
Those are mine!

404
00:31:18,021 --> 00:31:18,767
Four-Alike!

405
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:22,184
Ugh! When I get my hands on you!

406
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:24,709
Is that all immortals really are?

407
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:26,549
A bunch of glorified thieves?

408
00:31:26,699 --> 00:31:28,808
First the map, now my biscuits.

409
00:31:30,731 --> 00:31:31,494
Huh?

410
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:34,655
.... Stop.

411
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:39,391
Ugh! It's just a stupid wind chime.

412
00:31:39,832 --> 00:31:41,245
They're all over the place.

413
00:31:41,422 --> 00:31:44,851
Spirits are supposed to be comforted
by the sound of bones rattling.

414
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:46,480
Something like that, anyway.

415
00:31:47,748 --> 00:31:50,428
Like a consolation prize for being dead.

416
00:31:52,085 --> 00:31:52,589
Huh?

417
00:31:53,782 --> 00:31:55,815
These are messages from their loved ones.

418
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,720
A connection to life.

419
00:31:58,328 --> 00:32:00,540
They're a comfort to the living and the dead.

420
00:32:03,086 --> 00:32:04,330
The war is over.

421
00:32:04,826 --> 00:32:06,602
The Fox Clan has been defeated.

422
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:08,643
The world is healing.

423
00:32:09,206 --> 00:32:10,734
Rest in peace, all of you.

424
00:32:16,183 --> 00:32:18,449
Sentimental crap if you ask me.

425
00:32:42,855 --> 00:32:45,686
Ugh. That sedative knocked me out cold.

426
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:51,080
Okay. Where's the stubborn bastard gone to?

427
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:56,379
He's hurt? Of course, he is!

428
00:32:56,553 --> 00:32:57,236
Damn it!

429
00:32:59,699 --> 00:33:03,807
"The Field of the Undying is known far
and wide for its trees that don't die,

430
00:33:03,869 --> 00:33:08,566
flowers that don't wilt, and springs that don't run dry."

431
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:14,294
Charming place.

432
00:33:14,324 --> 00:33:16,867
Blame it on the Great War. Everything changed.

433
00:33:17,027 --> 00:33:18,734
You know, if the heat's getting to you,

434
00:33:18,781 --> 00:33:20,205
I'm more than happy to navigate.

435
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,507
Thank you, no.

436
00:33:22,509 --> 00:33:25,059
Get away! I don't have any food left!

437
00:33:26,162 --> 00:33:27,939
Uh, huh?

438
00:33:33,198 --> 00:33:34,721
Cut her ears off!

439
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,556
Uh..

440
00:33:51,622 --> 00:33:53,757
Water. I need water.

441
00:33:56,589 --> 00:33:59,724
You can't do anything for him.
There's barely enough for you.

442
00:34:01,376 --> 00:34:04,380
I'm not letting him die. That's all there is to it.

443
00:34:06,562 --> 00:34:08,279
Let go! Stop it!

444
00:34:08,383 --> 00:34:10,131
He doesn't deserve saving!

445
00:34:11,351 --> 00:34:12,792
Fox!

446
00:34:18,074 --> 00:34:19,418
The man's a fox hunter.

447
00:34:19,452 --> 00:34:21,594
He only sees me as game.

448
00:34:22,731 --> 00:34:26,823
Who came to my rescue when they tried to cut off my ears?

449
00:34:27,935 --> 00:34:29,382
Whatever he is, he hasn't harmed you!

450
00:34:29,453 --> 00:34:30,653
Just give him the chance!

451
00:34:30,678 --> 00:34:31,166
Don't!

452
00:34:32,065 --> 00:34:32,604
Fine!

453
00:34:32,644 --> 00:34:33,880
Have it your way!

454
00:34:36,002 --> 00:34:36,765
Follow her.

455
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:39,790
Calm yourself. I only mean to help.

456
00:34:40,347 --> 00:34:41,263
Hear me, Five Emperors.

457
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:45,326
Ye benevolent powers that govern the
body, heed my command and heal this...

458
00:34:45,657 --> 00:34:50,509
The fox is mine, do you understand
me? You can find your own on Mount Youdu.

459
00:35:01,104 --> 00:35:02,521
Fox Devil.

460
00:35:05,676 --> 00:35:07,358
Damn your trickery.

461
00:35:10,514 --> 00:35:12,452
Mount Youdu it is.

462
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,624
Once upon a time, there was an immortal from Heaven.

463
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:22,350
Sadly, without his map, there
wasn't a whole lot he could do. Huh?

464
00:35:28,422 --> 00:35:29,686
Ravens.

465
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:32,077
You guys always assume you're in charge.

466
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,578
Till I snap your necks!

467
00:36:08,285 --> 00:36:09,220
What the...

468
00:36:09,816 --> 00:36:11,135
Well, okay then...

469
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:19,013
What is this thing?

470
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,870
Move!

471
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:40,917
Get out of here!

472
00:36:41,446 --> 00:36:41,958
Uh...

473
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:44,000
Take Four-Alike! Go!

474
00:36:57,342 --> 00:36:59,977
Ha! Whoa! Come back!

475
00:37:05,282 --> 00:37:06,189
Idiots.

476
00:37:10,866 --> 00:37:12,944
I told her to get you out of here!

477
00:37:22,219 --> 00:37:23,407
Stupid mutt!

478
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:36,006
What are you doing? Quickly, give me the whip!

479
00:37:36,051 --> 00:37:36,846
I'm trying!

480
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,667
Look out!

481
00:37:38,315 --> 00:37:39,230
Oh no!

482
00:37:51,923 --> 00:37:52,842
The wind chime.

483
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:55,169
Give it the wind chime.

484
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:28,752
Those things, were they human?

485
00:38:29,928 --> 00:38:31,032
At one time.

486
00:38:31,405 --> 00:38:32,098
Huh?

487
00:38:36,937 --> 00:38:38,383
They're lost souls.

488
00:38:38,951 --> 00:38:40,322
Those who left home.

489
00:38:41,146 --> 00:38:42,641
Died on the battlefield.

490
00:38:43,231 --> 00:38:46,320
No graves. No friends or family.

491
00:38:47,489 --> 00:38:49,330
No hope of finding their way back.

492
00:38:50,325 --> 00:38:52,937
No way home? That's awful.

493
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,729
Blame the Great War.

494
00:39:14,282 --> 00:39:16,296
Will they be trapped here forever?

495
00:39:17,692 --> 00:39:18,885
Quite possibly.

496
00:39:20,799 --> 00:39:22,643
There's some hope for them, though.

497
00:39:22,782 --> 00:39:23,619
The Swallow.

498
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:28,467
A great beast said to traverse
the sky when moved by human grief.

499
00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:33,222
When moved by human grief.

500
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:35,895
Jiu.

501
00:39:40,642 --> 00:39:41,498
You okay?

502
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:45,646
I have a home and a family.

503
00:39:47,144 --> 00:39:48,408
My father's waiting.

504
00:39:48,592 --> 00:39:49,672
I'll find him.

505
00:39:58,477 --> 00:39:59,321
This will be able to calm your wound.

506
00:39:59,345 --> 00:40:00,080
The map.

507
00:40:00,345 --> 00:40:01,675
What'll we do without it?

508
00:40:21,977 --> 00:40:23,327
Silly creature.

509
00:40:27,501 --> 00:40:29,095
Yeah, you're pretty cute.

510
00:41:18,926 --> 00:41:19,506
Ha!

511
00:41:46,549 --> 00:41:47,264
Uh...

512
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:53,407
Father...

513
00:41:53,621 --> 00:41:54,716
Get inside.

514
00:41:55,788 --> 00:41:56,671
Devil.

515
00:41:57,096 --> 00:41:58,721
He's only a child!

516
00:42:01,892 --> 00:42:03,934
Fox Devil! Get her!

517
00:42:04,032 --> 00:42:05,497
Don't let her get away!

518
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,567
Give him the knife. Let him do it.

519
00:42:14,898 --> 00:42:16,565
Cut her ears off!

520
00:42:26,204 --> 00:42:27,059
A nightmare?

521
00:42:29,367 --> 00:42:31,357
"May you sleep the sleep of the just... "

522
00:42:34,016 --> 00:42:36,299
That's the most practical chant I've ever heard.

523
00:42:36,402 --> 00:42:38,032
Is it like a traditional one?

524
00:42:39,852 --> 00:42:41,478
It's not exactly a chant.

525
00:42:45,339 --> 00:42:46,644
It's from the Great War.

526
00:42:47,018 --> 00:42:49,051
Soldiers used to say it before bed.

527
00:42:49,268 --> 00:42:50,369
The Great War.

528
00:42:50,615 --> 00:42:52,198
Was Four-Alike part of it?

529
00:42:53,968 --> 00:42:55,488
The last time we were here,

530
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:57,569
all this was ocean.

531
00:42:58,864 --> 00:43:01,326
Four-Alike crossed it with a single step

532
00:43:01,493 --> 00:43:03,169
and shattered enemy ranks.

533
00:43:03,745 --> 00:43:07,149
Vanquish Nine Tailed, and the world would be restored.

534
00:43:08,373 --> 00:43:11,336
At least that's what we all told ourselves.

535
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:14,574
But it didn't work out that way.

536
00:43:14,615 --> 00:43:16,786
The world just fell into greater ruin.

537
00:43:17,867 --> 00:43:19,639
You think this place had it bad.

538
00:43:19,664 --> 00:43:21,323
You should see where I'm from.

539
00:43:25,074 --> 00:43:27,233
Uh, of course, I'm kidding.

540
00:43:28,021 --> 00:43:30,968
Actually, I bet you'll think it's beautiful.

541
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:33,954
So, you know, worth the journey.

542
00:43:34,138 --> 00:43:36,221
What are the odds your father is still there?

543
00:43:36,568 --> 00:43:36,908
Uh...

544
00:43:40,865 --> 00:43:42,250
Really wish I could tell you.

545
00:43:43,497 --> 00:43:45,407
I haven't been able to remember anything.

546
00:43:46,381 --> 00:43:48,335
Not since waking up in the desert.

547
00:43:50,115 --> 00:43:51,124
I dream, though.

548
00:43:52,172 --> 00:43:53,721
About this doll he made.

549
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:56,671
A little thing.

550
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,625
All strung with stones.

551
00:43:58,795 --> 00:44:01,430
Just clinking away in the breeze.

552
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,457
It was like a windchime.

553
00:44:06,074 --> 00:44:07,427
Calling me home.

554
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,619
Whenever I'd sneak away,

555
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:17,273
he'd hang it above the front door.

556
00:44:20,269 --> 00:44:21,705
The wind would pick up.

557
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:24,995
And I'd follow the sound back.

558
00:44:29,874 --> 00:44:30,460
Jiu.

559
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:33,502
In the dream that's what he calls me.

560
00:44:36,221 --> 00:44:38,342
And the place where the black flowers bloom?

561
00:44:39,417 --> 00:44:40,780
That's where he's waiting.

562
00:44:53,355 --> 00:44:55,577
It's not just a dream. It's real.

563
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,610
My whole purpose in life.

564
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,520
You better believe I'll find him.

565
00:45:10,032 --> 00:45:10,544
Huh...

566
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:21,205
It's the Swallow.

567
00:46:20,647 --> 00:46:22,855
The restless souls have been called home.

568
00:46:23,518 --> 00:46:25,583
The Swallow has given them hope.

569
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:49,891
Shall we go?

570
00:46:51,374 --> 00:46:52,615
According to the map

571
00:46:52,907 --> 00:46:55,783
the tail of the Milky Way points to Mount Youdu.

572
00:47:00,048 --> 00:47:01,432
Now we're friends.

573
00:47:01,608 --> 00:47:02,813
Eat up, you'll need it.

574
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:05,339
Impressive memory.

575
00:47:09,824 --> 00:47:12,847
Stop sniffing at me. I don't have any more biscuits.

576
00:47:14,115 --> 00:47:16,201
Except that one! That one's mine!

577
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,491
Give it back! Ugh!

578
00:47:28,574 --> 00:47:31,674
"When you see the Stone Forest, follow Heishui upstream.”

579
00:47:32,025 --> 00:47:34,194
The entrance to Mount Youdu must be up ahead.

580
00:47:35,076 --> 00:47:36,045
Are you sure?

581
00:47:36,949 --> 00:47:38,850
All I see is a bunch of rocks.

582
00:47:39,325 --> 00:47:40,272
And dirt.

583
00:47:41,674 --> 00:47:42,545
I'm sure.

584
00:47:43,334 --> 00:47:45,064
There's more here than meets the eye.

585
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:48,813
Black flowers?

586
00:47:49,321 --> 00:47:50,613
We've gotta be close!

587
00:47:51,824 --> 00:47:52,508
Watch out!

588
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:57,736
Jiang Ziya!

589
00:48:01,834 --> 00:48:03,924
Where the hell do you think you're going?

590
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:07,222
You can't just leave Beihai! Rules are rules!

591
00:48:07,882 --> 00:48:09,614
Rules you've now broken too.

592
00:48:10,611 --> 00:48:14,231
I had no choice! The Fox Devil was making an idiot of you!

593
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:14,703
Let's go back before...

594
00:48:14,727 --> 00:48:15,675
I can't go back yet.

595
00:48:15,823 --> 00:48:16,374
<i>Wha...</i>

596
00:48:17,319 --> 00:48:19,989
I, uh, think you're buddy's about to explode.

597
00:48:21,283 --> 00:48:22,769
Jiang Ziya!

598
00:48:23,933 --> 00:48:25,016
Your face.

599
00:48:25,824 --> 00:48:27,124
That wound should've healed!

600
00:48:27,149 --> 00:48:28,983
C'mon, your powers are dwindling.

601
00:48:29,016 --> 00:48:30,890
Damn it. Do you wanna die out here?

602
00:48:32,648 --> 00:48:34,188
I will return to Beihai...

603
00:48:35,282 --> 00:48:36,715
when I have uncovered the truth.

604
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,002
Truth about what?

605
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:40,822
She's the girl I found in Nine Tailed clutches.

606
00:48:40,952 --> 00:48:42,340
I have to know who she is.

607
00:48:42,856 --> 00:48:43,386
Huh?

608
00:48:45,718 --> 00:48:46,732
Uh... This is her?

609
00:48:46,827 --> 00:48:47,774
Why are you so an...

610
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:48,449
Speak!

611
00:48:48,553 --> 00:48:49,522
Put her down!

612
00:48:50,381 --> 00:48:51,507
You've been possessed.

613
00:48:51,532 --> 00:48:53,157
Let go! I don't have to tell you anything!

614
00:48:53,157 --> 00:48:54,400
Stubborn, aren't we?

615
00:48:54,657 --> 00:48:55,986
Show me your true form!

616
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:56,847
Shen Gongbao!

617
00:49:02,085 --> 00:49:02,981
Four-Alike!

618
00:49:03,556 --> 00:49:04,330
Huh?

619
00:49:04,793 --> 00:49:06,328
Get back here?

620
00:49:06,352 --> 00:49:06,927
Stop!

621
00:49:07,484 --> 00:49:09,925
Four-Alike. Where are you?

622
00:49:10,737 --> 00:49:11,671
Four-Alike!

623
00:49:13,602 --> 00:49:14,282
Huh...

624
00:49:14,893 --> 00:49:15,468
Uh...

625
00:49:20,589 --> 00:49:21,213
Uh?

626
00:49:21,408 --> 00:49:23,231
Over here.

627
00:49:25,952 --> 00:49:27,012
This way.

628
00:49:28,418 --> 00:49:29,252
Father?

629
00:49:30,202 --> 00:49:31,246
Is that you?

630
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:34,243
Father!

631
00:49:42,886 --> 00:49:44,340
Use your head.

632
00:49:44,502 --> 00:49:47,191
How many lives did the Fox Devil destroy?

633
00:49:47,322 --> 00:49:49,895
If the truth is so important to you, open your eyes!

634
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:53,692
Things aren't what they seem!

635
00:49:53,717 --> 00:49:54,391
Bullshit!

636
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:56,281
We've been down this road before!

637
00:49:57,044 --> 00:49:57,973
You are hopeless!

638
00:50:05,131 --> 00:50:07,150
That which is inescapable

639
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:09,295
we call fate.

640
00:50:10,365 --> 00:50:12,474
That which is unbreakable

641
00:50:12,818 --> 00:50:14,545
we call love.

642
00:50:18,027 --> 00:50:19,678
Father, is that you?

643
00:50:19,919 --> 00:50:21,085
"Father?"

644
00:50:22,698 --> 00:50:25,454
Foolish child, I am not your father.

645
00:50:25,801 --> 00:50:27,000
Humph. Who are you?

646
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,990
Ooh, what a question!

647
00:50:32,051 --> 00:50:34,911
I bind the fates of mortals together.

648
00:50:34,936 --> 00:50:38,422
I am the God of Marriage!

649
00:50:41,632 --> 00:50:43,585
You're deranged! Untie me!

650
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:46,176
As you wish.

651
00:50:54,452 --> 00:50:57,435
Your face is so exquisitely familiar.

652
00:50:57,824 --> 00:50:58,736
Uh, ah...

653
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,790
The Lock of Destiny?

654
00:51:03,577 --> 00:51:05,326
You recognize my bracelet?

655
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,128
How could I not?

656
00:51:11,982 --> 00:51:13,587
It isn't a bracelet.

657
00:51:13,999 --> 00:51:16,917
See. It's a very powerful lock.

658
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:17,865
What?

659
00:51:17,892 --> 00:51:21,000
It binds two spirits together inexorably.

660
00:51:21,277 --> 00:51:24,732
If one should perish, then so shall the other!

661
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:31,620
My beloved consort wore the companion to
this very lock on her person, which can only mean

662
00:51:31,961 --> 00:51:34,918
the two of you are bound together eternally!

663
00:51:35,278 --> 00:51:39,977
When the chain materializes,
I'll be able to find her again!

664
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:47,351
Materialize, my love!

665
00:51:54,074 --> 00:51:54,623
Jiu!

666
00:51:55,501 --> 00:51:57,075
Don't you run away from me!

667
00:51:57,450 --> 00:52:00,213
Where are you? Come to me!

668
00:52:04,513 --> 00:52:07,960
Son of a... Why do you keep making the same mistakes?

669
00:52:09,851 --> 00:52:13,387
You're the Fox Devil that cost my beloved her life!

670
00:52:16,598 --> 00:52:17,318
Jiu!

671
00:52:24,732 --> 00:52:25,608
Look out!

672
00:53:07,502 --> 00:53:08,133
Sorcery.

673
00:53:08,157 --> 00:53:09,518
You see it now?

674
00:53:14,395 --> 00:53:16,413
It's her. She's...

675
00:53:16,907 --> 00:53:17,865
Why?

676
00:53:18,177 --> 00:53:20,948
Why murder the woman I cherished?

677
00:53:20,981 --> 00:53:23,021
Why destroy my kingdom?

678
00:53:23,243 --> 00:53:24,634
She did this.

679
00:53:24,811 --> 00:53:26,709
It's all her doing.

680
00:53:26,822 --> 00:53:29,822
What you see is evil incarnate.

681
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:32,738
Kill her.

682
00:53:33,997 --> 00:53:35,526
Kill her.

683
00:53:37,035 --> 00:53:38,037
Kill her.

684
00:53:39,771 --> 00:53:41,088
Kill her.

685
00:53:54,493 --> 00:53:56,595
No one is waiting for you anywhere.

686
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,934
I have to find my father.

687
00:54:09,777 --> 00:54:10,707
Jiu!

688
00:54:11,993 --> 00:54:12,985
Stop!

689
00:54:14,449 --> 00:54:17,282
Kill her!

690
00:54:17,699 --> 00:54:21,324
No. If she dies so will my love!

691
00:54:46,363 --> 00:54:48,323
Aah...

692
00:54:54,171 --> 00:54:56,116
Jiang Ziya.

693
00:54:57,006 --> 00:54:59,501
How long has it been?

694
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:03,228
Nine Tailed.

695
00:55:03,404 --> 00:55:06,064
It's you. Didn't the holy device behead you?

696
00:55:06,142 --> 00:55:08,703
Jiang Ziya saved me.

697
00:55:10,615 --> 00:55:12,221
Let her go!

698
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:13,849
Release her!

699
00:55:21,705 --> 00:55:22,582
Ha!

700
00:55:29,947 --> 00:55:32,934
My mortal body was indeed beheaded.

701
00:55:33,561 --> 00:55:36,469
But as long as my spirit endures

702
00:55:36,943 --> 00:55:39,370
taking physical form is simple!

703
00:55:39,577 --> 00:55:42,086
Enough! Foul sorceress!

704
00:55:42,329 --> 00:55:43,832
No one cares!

705
00:55:46,126 --> 00:55:48,966
Where did this precious kitty come from?

706
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,158
Watch out!

707
00:55:50,611 --> 00:55:52,549
Ten short years.

708
00:55:52,674 --> 00:55:57,269
That's all it's taken for you
to sink this low, Jiang Ziya.

709
00:55:57,349 --> 00:56:00,462
How utterly heartbreaking.

710
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:03,823
Don't you find that sad?

711
00:56:04,142 --> 00:56:05,055
Jiu?

712
00:56:05,556 --> 00:56:07,320
Oh, forgive me.

713
00:56:07,685 --> 00:56:11,133
I should call you Su Daji.

714
00:56:11,673 --> 00:56:13,222
My beloved.

715
00:56:14,151 --> 00:56:15,214
Behold.

716
00:56:15,797 --> 00:56:18,696
The Zu family's eldest daughter.

717
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:21,436
Betrothed to Emperor Zhou.

718
00:56:21,928 --> 00:56:24,178
Such a simple human girl.

719
00:56:28,563 --> 00:56:28,962
Wha...

720
00:56:29,168 --> 00:56:29,894
Hmm...

721
00:56:30,443 --> 00:56:32,231
What have you done with my father?

722
00:56:34,425 --> 00:56:36,529
Think carefully, child.

723
00:56:36,732 --> 00:56:39,007
The memory will come to you.

724
00:56:50,291 --> 00:56:51,140
Is that you?

725
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:53,585
Uh... Father, what?

726
00:56:55,513 --> 00:56:56,208
Go.

727
00:56:59,306 --> 00:57:02,618
I crept into your ceremonial carriage

728
00:57:02,857 --> 00:57:05,105
and took your shape for my own.

729
00:57:05,307 --> 00:57:09,649
And I became the Emperor's cherished consort.

730
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:11,381
And yet...

731
00:57:11,589 --> 00:57:13,726
This lock was meant to tether you.

732
00:57:13,877 --> 00:57:16,181
Binding you to me forever.

733
00:57:18,241 --> 00:57:21,215
Your spirit is strong. It escaped,

734
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:26,078
taking with it your former body
and a small measure of my power.

735
00:57:26,341 --> 00:57:29,126
And now? You must return!

736
00:57:30,611 --> 00:57:31,709
Stop!

737
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,181
Cursed feline!

738
00:58:08,797 --> 00:58:09,845
Hiya!

739
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,078
Master?

740
00:58:30,553 --> 00:58:31,428
Alas,

741
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:36,762
a lock forged by the Revered Master
is not for the likes of you to break.

742
00:58:38,331 --> 00:58:39,788
My Power.

743
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:42,475
My Power!

744
00:58:44,152 --> 00:58:46,542
Shit! Her power's coming back!

745
00:58:47,476 --> 00:58:48,465
Master.

746
00:58:48,982 --> 00:58:50,127
The truth...

747
00:58:50,707 --> 00:58:51,343
I have to know.

748
00:58:51,368 --> 00:58:52,288
Don't listen!

749
00:58:52,614 --> 00:58:55,888
She wants to confuse you! Don't give credence to her lies!

750
00:58:56,467 --> 00:58:58,420
You dare call me a liar?

751
00:58:59,007 --> 00:59:02,099
Heaven is meant to protect all living things.

752
00:59:03,257 --> 00:59:07,338
Have you any notion of the atrocities
committed by your Revered Master?

753
00:59:07,363 --> 00:59:07,933
Shen Gongbao!

754
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:12,338
That said.

755
00:59:12,625 --> 00:59:16,168
If not for Jiang Ziya's kindness toward one in peril,

756
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:20,349
never would I have had the opportunity to break free.

757
00:59:21,587 --> 00:59:24,996
It's a pity you're so mired that truth eludes you.

758
00:59:28,834 --> 00:59:29,737
Let them go.

759
00:59:29,761 --> 00:59:31,583
Don't despair, child.

760
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:33,211
I won't kill you.

761
00:59:36,127 --> 00:59:36,985
Jiu!

762
00:59:42,593 --> 00:59:43,428
Four-Alike!

763
00:59:55,276 --> 00:59:56,442
Conceal.

764
00:59:57,183 --> 00:59:57,907
The lock!

765
00:59:57,931 --> 00:59:58,714
Run!

766
00:59:59,476 --> 01:00:01,434
You're not going anywhere!

767
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:03,820
Faster!

768
01:00:09,984 --> 01:00:11,678
The lock remains!

769
01:00:11,824 --> 01:00:13,658
You cannot hope to save her!

770
01:00:13,866 --> 01:00:15,772
There is no escape!

771
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:20,272
The Fox Clan will rise again!

772
01:00:50,661 --> 01:00:51,858
You were right.

773
01:00:53,471 --> 01:00:54,503
No one's...

774
01:00:55,417 --> 01:00:58,799
No one's... waiting for me.

775
01:01:08,619 --> 01:01:10,130
Four-Alike, what's wrong!

776
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:11,233
Watch out!

777
01:01:12,449 --> 01:01:13,227
Jiu!

778
01:01:21,977 --> 01:01:22,784
Four-Alike!

779
01:01:24,468 --> 01:01:26,344
Huh... No.

780
01:01:30,668 --> 01:01:32,970
Eight Effulgences of the Three Regions, heed my command.

781
01:01:32,995 --> 01:01:35,361
Eight Effulgences of the Three Regions, heed my command.

782
01:01:35,386 --> 01:01:37,840
Eight Effulgences of the Three Regions, heed my command.

783
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:39,899
Eight Effulgences...

784
01:01:44,448 --> 01:01:45,532
Just hold on.

785
01:02:05,758 --> 01:02:06,896
What's happening?

786
01:02:23,138 --> 01:02:24,247
Four-Alike.

787
01:03:14,002 --> 01:03:15,095
Fore-Alike.

788
01:04:16,567 --> 01:04:18,726
Where are you?

789
01:04:23,629 --> 01:04:25,473
There you are.

790
01:04:25,834 --> 01:04:27,211
My love.

791
01:04:29,309 --> 01:04:31,606
What is the world coming to,

792
01:04:31,971 --> 01:04:35,077
when even you can become a deity?

793
01:04:35,139 --> 01:04:36,833
Return her to me.

794
01:04:37,692 --> 01:04:41,513
Your consort is as dead as your legacy.

795
01:04:42,447 --> 01:04:44,308
Farewell.

796
01:04:59,862 --> 01:05:01,105
All these years...

797
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:03,965
people thought you were bewitched.

798
01:05:04,933 --> 01:05:05,687
In the end,

799
01:05:06,745 --> 01:05:08,074
we were the fools.

800
01:05:11,093 --> 01:05:13,474
Jingxu Hall will eliminate Nine Tailed.

801
01:05:14,045 --> 01:05:16,121
But if the Lock of Destiny isn't broken.

802
01:05:17,645 --> 01:05:20,706
If Nine Tailed dies, she'll die, too, Won't she?

803
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:25,972
I don't get it.

804
01:05:28,043 --> 01:05:30,377
If the Master forged it with his own hands,

805
01:05:30,791 --> 01:05:32,458
what are we supposed to do?

806
01:05:33,136 --> 01:05:34,647
What do we even believe?

807
01:05:39,157 --> 01:05:40,718
Why don't we go to the source?

808
01:05:50,407 --> 01:05:53,192
I'll speak with him myself and have the lock undone.

809
01:05:58,454 --> 01:05:59,253
Appear!

810
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:13,760
They won't lower the stairway for you anymore.

811
01:06:16,446 --> 01:06:16,986
Wait.

812
01:06:17,221 --> 01:06:18,280
It's too costly!

813
01:06:18,549 --> 01:06:19,926
You're not alone in this.

814
01:06:23,726 --> 01:06:24,809
Go to them.

815
01:06:25,325 --> 01:06:26,688
Find the answer!

816
01:06:58,186 --> 01:06:59,915
I seek the Revered Master.

817
01:07:00,811 --> 01:07:02,367
Presumption.

818
01:07:05,682 --> 01:07:08,733
You were ordered to contemplate your errors.

819
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:11,227
And instead, you chose to leave.

820
01:07:11,306 --> 01:07:12,856
You should be punished.

821
01:07:13,006 --> 01:07:14,501
Which I accept willingly.

822
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:18,512
But Nine Tailed lives. Her spirit tied to an innocent.

823
01:07:18,805 --> 01:07:20,229
The master knows the truth!

824
01:07:21,032 --> 01:07:22,486
Silence!

825
01:07:22,534 --> 01:07:23,980
You may not pass!

826
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:28,751
If he has nothing to hide

827
01:07:28,929 --> 01:07:30,462
then why will he not speak to me?

828
01:07:30,487 --> 01:07:31,732
How dare you!

829
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,070
Did you fasten the Lock of Destiny?

830
01:07:36,648 --> 01:07:38,630
Does Nine Tailed share your blood?

831
01:07:43,419 --> 01:07:44,803
Is this the way of Heaven?

832
01:07:45,805 --> 01:07:47,955
Would you sacrifice a child?

833
01:08:24,661 --> 01:08:25,479
Master.

834
01:08:28,322 --> 01:08:29,594
Jiang Ziya.

835
01:08:29,906 --> 01:08:35,093
Everything Jingxu Hall does, it does
with the sole aim of protecting life.

836
01:08:36,807 --> 01:08:37,890
Tell me, please.

837
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:40,727
Why would you have me believe
what I saw was a mere illusion?

838
01:08:42,246 --> 01:08:46,163
Because the scope of your understanding is small.

839
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:50,267
Your heart is kind.

840
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:52,437
But your compassion, scattered.

841
01:08:52,587 --> 01:08:55,065
Your sense of the greater good is skewed.

842
01:08:55,402 --> 01:08:58,308
I ordered you to execute Nine Tailed.

843
01:08:58,699 --> 01:09:01,604
Not to crush evil, but kindness.

844
01:09:02,303 --> 01:09:03,535
Crush kindness?

845
01:09:05,315 --> 01:09:05,807
But,

846
01:09:06,952 --> 01:09:08,619
what is wrong with kindness?

847
01:09:08,732 --> 01:09:12,490
In itself, nothing. But, alas, for gods...

848
01:09:13,176 --> 01:09:16,811
Kindness shown to one person only is a sin.

849
01:09:20,082 --> 01:09:22,509
One day there will come a time

850
01:09:23,256 --> 01:09:26,775
when a god must sacrifice one to save all.

851
01:09:30,861 --> 01:09:34,180
Jiang Ziya must return to Beihai immediately.

852
01:09:34,639 --> 01:09:37,182
Once his mind is free of illusion.

853
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:41,251
He may return to his rightful place as leader of the gods

854
01:09:41,327 --> 01:09:44,118
and protector of the Three Realms.

855
01:09:47,204 --> 01:09:48,974
If I fail to save one life,

856
01:09:50,338 --> 01:09:51,571
how can I save all?

857
01:09:53,383 --> 01:09:54,527
Insolence!

858
01:09:54,605 --> 01:09:57,927
You would put one life above all else?

859
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,581
They're all connected. Like drops of water.

860
01:10:03,984 --> 01:10:09,597
Life is an ocean. In my eyes,

861
01:10:09,819 --> 01:10:13,952
Jiu, and all living things, are one and the same.

862
01:10:16,281 --> 01:10:19,896
The great war ripped untold soldiers from home and family.

863
01:10:23,275 --> 01:10:24,909
I'm ashamed of my role.

864
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,047
I no longer want to be a god.

865
01:10:29,157 --> 01:10:30,073
To have power.

866
01:10:31,668 --> 01:10:35,070
All I want is to save whoever I'm able.

867
01:10:38,137 --> 01:10:41,283
I see. You are certain of this?

868
01:10:48,927 --> 01:10:51,605
Once the Lock of Destiny is fastened

869
01:10:51,805 --> 01:10:54,718
it cannot be undone in the same lifetime.

870
01:10:56,343 --> 01:10:57,897
The only answer...

871
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,216
Is reincarnation.

872
01:11:03,974 --> 01:11:06,994
Escort Su Daji to the Ruins of Return.

873
01:11:07,406 --> 01:11:10,600
Let her step into the light and be reborn.

874
01:11:12,543 --> 01:11:14,207
Thank you, Revered Master.

875
01:11:38,863 --> 01:11:39,689
Is this it?

876
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:20,199
Nine Tailed! Run!

877
01:12:26,282 --> 01:12:27,341
Go without me.

878
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:30,257
Shen.

879
01:12:35,585 --> 01:12:36,653
I... Just go.

880
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:39,885
Do what has to be done.

881
01:12:41,341 --> 01:12:42,197
Save her...

882
01:12:43,373 --> 01:12:44,469
and come home.

883
01:12:46,098 --> 01:12:47,067
Of course.

884
01:13:49,222 --> 01:13:50,080
Uh...

885
01:13:56,307 --> 01:13:57,880
Don't you want to be a god?

886
01:13:57,905 --> 01:13:59,873
No. Go on.

887
01:14:00,356 --> 01:14:01,844
You've stood by me long enough.

888
01:14:02,351 --> 01:14:03,839
Report back to the master.

889
01:14:04,068 --> 01:14:05,055
Do as I say.

890
01:14:05,142 --> 01:14:07,002
I came here without his permission...

891
01:14:13,442 --> 01:14:14,584
Jiang Ziya.

892
01:14:15,426 --> 01:14:17,197
I used to be so jealous.

893
01:14:17,943 --> 01:14:19,683
You were the Master's favorite.

894
01:14:20,371 --> 01:14:21,643
Everyone loved you.

895
01:14:23,956 --> 01:14:25,139
But I get it now.

896
01:14:30,072 --> 01:14:31,879
You didn't become a hero.

897
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,335
You've always been one.

898
01:14:39,275 --> 01:14:40,434
But this time...

899
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:42,880
it's my turn.

900
01:15:24,517 --> 01:15:25,700
Jiang Ziya.

901
01:15:26,032 --> 01:15:26,866
Yes?

902
01:15:28,397 --> 01:15:30,188
Where are you taking us?

903
01:15:30,706 --> 01:15:31,857
To break the lock.

904
01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:33,672
You're going to be reborn.

905
01:15:34,862 --> 01:15:36,852
Reborn as what?

906
01:15:40,782 --> 01:15:42,400
How do you like that?

907
01:15:43,385 --> 01:15:45,934
I'm right back at where I started.

908
01:15:46,477 --> 01:15:47,999
Empty-handed.

909
01:15:49,568 --> 01:15:53,427
When I opened by eyes all I could see were ruins.

910
01:15:54,455 --> 01:15:55,828
Whoever I met.

911
01:15:56,703 --> 01:15:58,453
Just wanted to hurt me.

912
01:15:59,299 --> 01:16:00,911
I tried to tell them...

913
01:16:01,115 --> 01:16:03,239
I said I wasn't a Fox Devil.

914
01:16:05,562 --> 01:16:07,593
But they wouldn't believe me.

915
01:16:10,574 --> 01:16:11,824
In the next life

916
01:16:12,441 --> 01:16:14,609
you'll be a perfectly ordinary child.

917
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:16,642
With friends.

918
01:16:17,313 --> 01:16:18,128
Family.

919
01:16:19,459 --> 01:16:21,474
A father who loves and cares for you.

920
01:16:26,009 --> 01:16:27,225
Don't do that.

921
01:16:27,595 --> 01:16:29,760
Don't fill my head with lies.

922
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:31,850
I'd never do that.

923
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:39,524
Goodbye.

924
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:06,219
Huh.

925
01:18:34,595 --> 01:18:35,608
Jiang Ziya.

926
01:18:36,699 --> 01:18:37,483
Thank you...

927
01:19:17,829 --> 01:19:19,441
Damn you, Nine Tailed.

928
01:19:22,775 --> 01:19:24,404
Let it be finished!

929
01:19:52,777 --> 01:19:54,341
The lock has been broken.

930
01:19:54,697 --> 01:19:56,572
She is no longer bound to you.

931
01:20:16,156 --> 01:20:17,717
Let her...

932
01:20:18,093 --> 01:20:19,677
be reborn!

933
01:20:38,324 --> 01:20:40,136
Reborn?

934
01:20:41,056 --> 01:20:41,948
You're insane!

935
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:57,274
Surely you didn't think I would release her so easily?

936
01:20:58,655 --> 01:20:59,569
Stop this!

937
01:21:00,448 --> 01:21:02,143
The world must know.

938
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:05,664
People must see what the Revered Master has done!

939
01:21:14,492 --> 01:21:17,693
Arise, my fox brethren!

940
01:21:21,867 --> 01:21:23,571
Why the hell is my eye twitching?

941
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:25,907
I've had two drinks. Maybe.

942
01:21:25,932 --> 01:21:27,926
It's a sign of good fortune!

943
01:21:32,115 --> 01:21:33,026
What the?

944
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:01,612
Behold.

945
01:22:02,218 --> 01:22:04,735
These are my fox brethren.

946
01:22:05,166 --> 01:22:07,110
Thousands of them!

947
01:22:07,968 --> 01:22:09,826
Why are their souls restless?

948
01:22:10,403 --> 01:22:11,463
Years ago

949
01:22:11,987 --> 01:22:14,124
the Master made a promise.

950
01:22:14,703 --> 01:22:17,541
He told me I would become a god.

951
01:22:17,885 --> 01:22:19,543
But there was a price.

952
01:22:19,882 --> 01:22:22,944
I had to bind the Fox Clan to mortals

953
01:22:23,224 --> 01:22:26,527
and launch a war that would unite the Three Realms.

954
01:22:32,191 --> 01:22:33,543
Little did we know.

955
01:22:34,216 --> 01:22:39,174
When all was said and done the master reneged our bargain.

956
01:22:40,048 --> 01:22:42,084
He ordered our genocide.

957
01:22:42,465 --> 01:22:45,460
We were thrown into the bottomless pit.

958
01:22:46,101 --> 01:22:48,089
Never again to see the light.

959
01:22:48,565 --> 01:22:50,032
Never to be reborn.

960
01:22:50,064 --> 01:22:50,609
Oh...

961
01:22:52,436 --> 01:22:57,704
We were the true casualties of
the Revered Master's ultimate war.

962
01:22:59,238 --> 01:23:02,805
I believed him. In a moment of greed,

963
01:23:02,992 --> 01:23:05,497
I doomed my own kind!

964
01:23:09,915 --> 01:23:11,206
This cannot be.

965
01:23:11,285 --> 01:23:12,090
Today,

966
01:23:12,557 --> 01:23:17,287
the Revered Master shall know the
pain he wreaked upon the Fox Clan.

967
01:23:17,602 --> 01:23:23,118
The Three Realms will tremble
at the sight of our true power!

968
01:23:33,984 --> 01:23:35,353
Ah! Jiu!

969
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:27,482
Release me from this prison!

970
01:24:28,341 --> 01:24:30,045
Kill her!

971
01:24:31,383 --> 01:24:33,069
Undo the lock.

972
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:37,282
Kill her!

973
01:24:38,435 --> 01:24:39,287
Jiu!

974
01:24:56,275 --> 01:24:58,713
Whoa! Jiu!

975
01:25:10,185 --> 01:25:11,948
Revered Master.

976
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:16,429
We beg you to reconsider!

977
01:25:17,526 --> 01:25:21,357
What I do, I do for the greater good.

978
01:25:59,949 --> 01:26:04,337
Jiu. I won't.

979
01:26:42,510 --> 01:26:45,549
As long as the Lock of Destiny exists,

980
01:26:45,896 --> 01:26:47,954
you cannot save anyone.

981
01:26:48,657 --> 01:26:50,068
In times to come,

982
01:26:50,617 --> 01:26:53,318
others will repeat our mistake.

983
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:10,956
When I'm reborn,

984
01:27:11,789 --> 01:27:14,069
will I really have a father who loves me?

985
01:27:28,617 --> 01:27:30,857
No one should be denied salvation.

986
01:27:31,754 --> 01:27:32,882
Not gods.

987
01:27:33,653 --> 01:27:36,554
Not devils. Not mortals.

988
01:27:37,006 --> 01:27:40,254
We all deserve to live free from the yoke of oppression.

989
01:27:40,769 --> 01:27:42,678
We all deserve the truth.

990
01:27:55,169 --> 01:27:57,322
The lock has been undone.

991
01:28:01,252 --> 01:28:04,584
Father, Mother. Can we go home now?

992
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:24,726
Save me.

993
01:28:25,027 --> 01:28:28,023
Release me from this hell.

994
01:28:58,710 --> 01:29:00,158
Jiu!

995
01:29:07,191 --> 01:29:07,993
Ah...

996
01:29:08,651 --> 01:29:10,302
Jiang Ziya.

997
01:29:39,425 --> 01:29:41,456
Have I been reborn yet?

998
01:31:21,866 --> 01:31:23,232
Don't do that.

999
01:31:23,855 --> 01:31:26,099
Don't fill my head with lies.

1000
01:31:42,893 --> 01:31:48,365
Head Disciple Jiang Ziya has achieved
merit by luring out and vanquishing

1001
01:31:48,407 --> 01:31:50,674
the Fox Devil once and for all.

1002
01:31:50,808 --> 01:31:55,207
He may now reclaim his place as leader of the gods.

1003
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:16,859
One lock remains to be severed.

1004
01:32:51,808 --> 01:32:54,797
I, Jiang Ziya, hereby vow to follow the Master.

1005
01:32:54,884 --> 01:32:55,837
In everything.

1006
01:32:56,204 --> 01:32:58,992
To lead the gods, and protect all life.

1007
01:33:01,101 --> 01:33:02,654
To become a true god.

1008
01:33:03,146 --> 01:33:04,416
Stand apart.

1009
01:33:05,115 --> 01:33:06,783
Forge your own path.

1010
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:12,885
The Grand Duke has ascended.

1011
01:33:13,019 --> 01:33:16,134
All deities, fall back.

1012
01:33:17,002 --> 01:33:19,090
Approach, Jiang Ziya.

1013
01:33:19,202 --> 01:33:22,816
Kneel before heaven to be cleansed and deified.

1014
01:33:26,741 --> 01:33:27,831
<i>Kneel!</i>

1015
01:33:32,144 --> 01:33:33,661
Impudence!

1016
01:33:38,946 --> 01:33:40,862
There was no choice.

1017
01:33:41,099 --> 01:33:43,839
The Fox Devil was pure evil.

1018
01:33:47,819 --> 01:33:52,499
Search your heart. My actions were a gift to the world.

1019
01:34:07,613 --> 01:34:08,699
Henceforth,

1020
01:34:09,319 --> 01:34:11,027
may no one lose their home.

1021
01:34:12,990 --> 01:34:13,982
May no one

1022
01:34:14,763 --> 01:34:15,871
be deceived.

1023
01:34:17,949 --> 01:34:19,487
Let injustice...

1024
01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:25,783
be a thing of the past!

1025
01:34:27,903 --> 01:34:34,391
You've gone mad! If the stairway crumbles, the
world shall be cut off from divine protection!

1026
01:34:48,963 --> 01:34:51,004
What have you done?

1027
01:35:32,013 --> 01:35:32,860
And so,

1028
01:35:33,407 --> 01:35:35,694
Jiang Ziya demolished the Stairway

1029
01:35:36,289 --> 01:35:38,866
and the Revered Master was punished by Heaven.

1030
01:35:40,589 --> 01:35:41,908
The Swallow descended

1031
01:35:42,383 --> 01:35:44,355
and guided restless souls home.

1032
01:35:45,497 --> 01:35:49,606
Once again, the world saw peace and hope restored.

1033
01:35:50,324 --> 01:35:53,951
When I grow up, I want to be a hero just like that!

1034
01:35:54,729 --> 01:35:57,441
Master. Where does the Swallow come from?

1035
01:35:58,285 --> 01:36:02,430
Where indeed? A place far above even Jingxu Hall.

1036
01:36:03,327 --> 01:36:04,725
In the great beyond.

1037
01:36:05,431 --> 01:36:08,115
Where your master's master dwells.

1038
01:36:08,601 --> 01:36:11,733
Wow. So the master's master is the Revered Master.

1039
01:36:12,622 --> 01:36:15,150
And the Revered Master's master is...

1040
01:36:15,415 --> 01:36:16,898
Great Revered Master!

1041
01:36:17,056 --> 01:36:19,678
Hush! His name isn't for you to say.

1042
01:36:19,884 --> 01:36:22,809
He is the great deity far above the Ninth Heaven

1043
01:36:22,959 --> 01:36:24,747
and sends the Swallow to earth.

1044
01:36:24,772 --> 01:36:26,472
Jiang Ziya sure is amazing!

1045
01:36:26,519 --> 01:36:29,324
Even the Great Revered Master lent him a hand.

1046
01:36:29,364 --> 01:36:31,832
As expected of my "good friend."

1047
01:36:31,857 --> 01:36:37,615
Your good friend? You can search all of Beihai
and find no one closer to Jiang Ziya than me!

1048
01:36:37,688 --> 01:36:38,817
Cut the crap.

1049
01:36:38,939 --> 01:36:40,799
Your only good friend is drink.

1050
01:36:40,824 --> 01:36:44,292
Hard to believe Beihai is finally at peace.

1051
01:37:06,532 --> 01:37:08,824
A bite of biscuit A bite of sweets

1052
01:37:09,152 --> 01:37:11,288
Outside Beihai

1053
01:37:11,423 --> 01:37:13,823
Yellow fields of wheat

1054
01:37:13,887 --> 01:37:17,516
Mother and Father Sitting by my side

1055
01:37:17,572 --> 01:37:20,814
Humming a tune As I drift into a dreamland

1056
01:37:24,199 --> 01:37:26,266
What are those hanging from the tree?

1057
01:37:26,621 --> 01:37:29,752
What a pretty sound! I want one for my doll too!

1058
01:37:31,574 --> 01:37:32,439
Hmm.

1059
01:38:15,763 --> 01:38:17,407
Speaking of Jiang Ziya,

1060
01:38:17,693 --> 01:38:19,240
where exactly has he gone?

1061
01:38:19,804 --> 01:38:22,539
Far outside the Three Realms.

1062
01:38:22,697 --> 01:38:26,170
To a place known as the City of Tribulation,

1063
01:38:26,701 --> 01:38:33,931
is said to be a prison built
expressly for gods of his stature.

1064
01:38:39,812 --> 01:38:40,614
My Lord...

1065
01:38:41,082 --> 01:38:43,084
the Great Revered Master sends us...

1066
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:45,594
We've been order to take up posts.

1067
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:53,270
PLEASE WAIT, THERE'S A POST-CREDITS SCENE!

1068
01:39:54,868 --> 01:39:59,101
THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR WAITING!
LET'S MAKE UP FOR THE YEAR TOGETHER!

1069
01:40:12,457 --> 01:40:13,052
Huh!

1070
01:40:55,568 --> 01:40:56,155
Humph.

1071
01:41:19,414 --> 01:41:19,990
Ugh.

1072
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:50,910
Ugh...

1073
01:42:08,820 --> 01:42:09,587
Uh...

1074
01:42:16,955 --> 01:42:17,501
Mm...

1075
01:42:18,730 --> 01:42:19,578
Mm-hm.

1076
01:43:00,603 --> 01:43:02,512
Huh? Uh, huh...

1077
01:43:03,925 --> 01:43:05,640
May you live long!

1078
01:43:05,907 --> 01:43:08,532
May we meet again when the storm has passed.

1079
01:43:08,843 --> 01:43:11,829
Wishing you peace and good fortune in the times ahead.
