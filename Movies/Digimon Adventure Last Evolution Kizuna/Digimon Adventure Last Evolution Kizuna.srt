00:01:44,817 --> 00:01:51,318
In today's news... The mysterious worldwide
Aurora Phenomenon has made its way to Japan.

2
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:57,208
The strange kaleidoscope of colors glowing
across the night sky, was first observed

3
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:59,945
on the west coast of the United States of America,

4
00:02:00,297 --> 00:02:03,505
but soon began to quickly spread across the world.

5
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:08,261
The government believes the Aurora will
have a minimal impact on our daily lives,

6
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:14,040
and has confirmed to citizens that the
beautiful spectacle poses no danger whatsoever.

7
00:02:17,122 --> 00:02:19,768
Hey, I'm gonna be a bit late. Huh?

8
00:02:19,948 --> 00:02:21,484
Hello? Hello?

9
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:25,778
Look what you did!

10
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:26,831
But I had the light!

11
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:27,984
I had the light!!

12
00:02:28,071 --> 00:02:29,428
Heh, he's mad.

13
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:35,991
Huh?

14
00:03:08,765 --> 00:03:09,821
Are you okay!?

15
00:03:11,394 --> 00:03:12,952
It's not safe to stay here.

16
00:03:13,054 --> 00:03:14,230
Yeah, thank you.

17
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,875
Sorry, T.K.! We just got here!

18
00:03:19,973 --> 00:03:21,778
Kari, it's heading right for you!

19
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:22,826
I'm on it!

20
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:26,218
Angewomon!

21
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,318
Tai, we need you!

22
00:04:00,104 --> 00:04:01,669
Polly want a cracker?

23
00:04:02,192 --> 00:04:04,266
Let's do this, Agumon.

24
00:04:11,528 --> 00:04:14,308
I told him not to mess with my goggles.

25
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:17,844
Izzy these new glasses you gave me are completely useless!

26
00:04:17,869 --> 00:04:21,336
I told you... It's only a prototype! Not ready to use!

27
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:23,630
Forget that, you've got an incoming attack!

28
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:25,160
Yeah, I can see that.

29
00:04:25,454 --> 00:04:26,366
Agumon!

30
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:29,595
Digivolve!

31
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:46,429
Agumon digivolve to...

32
00:04:50,027 --> 00:04:51,305
Greymon!

33
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,153
Greymon!

34
00:05:03,335 --> 00:05:07,174
In 90 seconds, I'm going to open a
digital gate at the designated location.

35
00:05:07,547 --> 00:05:11,653
You have to lead Parrotmon there,
and send it back to the Digital World.

36
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,543
Roger!

37
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:23,164
Greymon! Kari, TK!

38
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,624
Yeah, we're on it!

39
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:31,983
You need to drive it toward the gate!

40
00:05:43,191 --> 00:05:44,115
Angemon!

41
00:05:48,707 --> 00:05:51,283
Parrotmon isn't usually this eager to fight.

42
00:05:51,862 --> 00:05:54,849
What's changed? Well, the Aurora for one thing.

43
00:05:54,874 --> 00:05:58,240
One small hole in your theory... The aurora's all gone!

44
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:09,516
Sixty seconds 'til the gate opens!

45
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,071
We have to lead it there now!

46
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:12,038
I'm trying!

47
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,035
Don't let it get away, Greymon!

48
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,497
Angemon!

49
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:18,683
Greymon!

50
00:06:35,905 --> 00:06:37,874
Oh no, you okay?

51
00:06:38,621 --> 00:06:39,449
Stop him!

52
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:50,480
All right!

53
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,913
Oh no, the building!

54
00:06:56,953 --> 00:06:58,051
Do something!

55
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,149
They're not gonna make it!

56
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:03,923
Look out!

57
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,205
Garurumon.

58
00:07:19,914 --> 00:07:21,682
You've gotten sloppy, Tai!

59
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:23,679
Finally, Matt!

60
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,008
You took forever to get here!

61
00:07:26,048 --> 00:07:28,742
Izzy, target is at the designated location.

62
00:07:29,131 --> 00:07:30,569
Target is verified.

63
00:07:30,768 --> 00:07:33,994
Gate opening in twenty seconds. Keep it there.

64
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:36,718
We can talk about this later on.

65
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,768
Fine. Let's finish this.

66
00:07:51,703 --> 00:07:55,589
Greymon digivolve to...

67
00:08:06,845 --> 00:08:09,142
MetalGreymon!

68
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,650
10, 9, 8, 7, 6...

69
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:45,108
...5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0!

70
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:02,874
The Digital Gate confirmed closed.

71
00:09:03,103 --> 00:09:05,391
Parrotmon's transport is complete!

72
00:09:07,604 --> 00:09:08,076
Hm.

73
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:10,929
Hm!

74
00:09:11,771 --> 00:09:13,295
Nice work, Tai!

75
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,362
Way to go, Matt!

76
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,523
Hurry, T.K.!

77
00:09:15,664 --> 00:09:19,551
Only four of us showed up? What's
with that? Where's everyone else?

78
00:09:20,384 --> 00:09:24,151
I'm sure they have their reasons.
Let's be grateful we were able to make it.

79
00:09:24,849 --> 00:09:28,591
I just realized I hadn't had
breakfast yet. Anybody else hungry?

80
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:29,533
I am!

81
00:09:29,558 --> 00:09:30,537
Food, food, food!

82
00:09:30,616 --> 00:09:31,857
When am I not?

83
00:09:31,991 --> 00:09:33,205
What about you, Kari?

84
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,340
Yeah, let's all go eat.

85
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:35,824
How about you, Tai?

86
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,987
I got class, which is more than I
can say for Matt. Smell ya later!

87
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:44,356
Hey Tai! Mom said she would like to
see your face again one of these days!

88
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:47,620
Sorry, guys, I've got things to do as well.

89
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,994
T.K., can you look after Gabumon?

90
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:50,504
Sure!

91
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:02,261
We're still eating, right?

92
00:11:39,637 --> 00:11:43,647
Hey, Tai. You've barely started
on your breakfast... or your thesis.

93
00:11:43,742 --> 00:11:45,913
Oh my, you still haven't started your thesis?

94
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,207
I'm working on some radical ideas.

95
00:11:48,234 --> 00:11:49,614
That doesn't sound promising.

96
00:11:49,672 --> 00:11:52,211
I don't get it, Tai, don't you even want to graduate?

97
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,080
Yes, I do! That I do know.

98
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,207
And what about a job?

99
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:56,348
Yeah, I'll get one!

100
00:11:56,409 --> 00:11:57,983
Don't point at me with chopsticks!

101
00:11:58,022 --> 00:11:59,937
I've got three job offers. And you?

102
00:12:01,056 --> 00:12:03,290
I'm guessing you haven't even started looking yet.

103
00:12:03,536 --> 00:12:05,324
Do you even know what you're doing?

104
00:12:05,443 --> 00:12:07,038
I've totally got this!

105
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,189
It's just not the right time... that's all.

106
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:13,185
I have a right to know who's saying that.

107
00:12:13,355 --> 00:12:17,951
Everybody's saying that. Word is you're
joining the Self Defense Forces as an officer.

108
00:12:18,268 --> 00:12:20,739
Come on. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

109
00:12:20,979 --> 00:12:22,670
Sounded believable to me.

110
00:12:22,838 --> 00:12:26,787
But I guess it's hard to keep rumors from spreading
when you're the center of the universe around here.

111
00:12:27,264 --> 00:12:29,882
What do they call you, Digi-Ordained or something?

112
00:12:29,907 --> 00:12:31,361
I don't really follow you.

113
00:12:31,943 --> 00:12:35,644
Just this morning, you and your digi-friends
saved the day once again didn't you.

114
00:12:36,512 --> 00:12:40,589
But I'm just a regular dude,
graduating to work a regular job.

115
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,478
You got an offer?

116
00:12:41,565 --> 00:12:43,087
Yeah! My first choice!

117
00:12:43,552 --> 00:12:46,250
All right! That's great news.

118
00:12:46,507 --> 00:12:47,340
Mhm!

119
00:14:27,777 --> 00:14:33,426
Mmm. I see. In other words... you're crying
after someone called you lazy, which you are.

120
00:14:33,554 --> 00:14:35,873
Well, I don't think I used the word "crying."

121
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:42,381
It's just... it made me realize
what I really want to do after school.

122
00:14:42,521 --> 00:14:46,859
So if you've got it all figured out, what do
you need me for, other than to buy you beer.

123
00:14:48,544 --> 00:14:49,466
Tell me something,

124
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:53,668
you said you decided to go on to
grad school. Why not look for a job?

125
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,037
Good question.

126
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:57,093
You don't know?

127
00:14:57,243 --> 00:15:00,804
I have no idea if grad school
is the right choice for me or not.

128
00:15:01,137 --> 00:15:03,981
But trying to find the thing that I really want to do...

129
00:15:04,481 --> 00:15:07,215
It just seems like I'm postponing the inevitable.

130
00:15:13,006 --> 00:15:15,977
Most of our friends know what
they want to do in life already.

131
00:15:16,953 --> 00:15:18,050
...It makes you wonder.

132
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:19,750
That's for sure.

133
00:15:20,658 --> 00:15:22,874
Joe is on his way to being a doctor.

134
00:15:23,771 --> 00:15:27,559
Mimi is accessorizing the internet
with the online startup she launched.

135
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,537
And Izzy's is already a company president!

136
00:15:31,254 --> 00:15:35,474
Even Kari and Davis... They seem
to know exactly what they want to do.

137
00:15:36,331 --> 00:15:37,663
What about, T.K.?

138
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:42,003
He's writing a novel. But he
hasn't let me read a word of it yet.

139
00:15:42,432 --> 00:15:44,030
Hm. Novel, huh?

140
00:15:45,548 --> 00:15:49,148
Seems like Sora's getting serious about flower arranging.

141
00:15:49,608 --> 00:15:50,664
Yeah...

142
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,138
Too bad things can't stay the same forever.

143
00:15:56,233 --> 00:16:00,392
Friends sometimes grow apart... as
their lives go in different directions.

144
00:16:06,002 --> 00:16:08,734
Agumon and the other Digimon never change.

145
00:16:09,274 --> 00:16:11,651
We've had lots of adventures with those guys, huh...

146
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:12,977
Too many to count.

147
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,207
...You're right. They don't change.

148
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,076
Why don't you take 'em to school with you?

149
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,626
Heh! Ha, that would be a total scene!

150
00:16:18,872 --> 00:16:20,700
I think you should take them to your school.

151
00:16:20,725 --> 00:16:24,350
Like that's even possible, I've
got things going on in my life, Matt.

152
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,487
It's been so crazy, John lost his job.

153
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:32,333
No one ever told me being an adult was so hard.

154
00:16:32,565 --> 00:16:35,576
Matt, tell me... Do you think we'll...

155
00:16:37,027 --> 00:16:39,596
Ayaka, what's wrong? Please wake up!

156
00:16:39,675 --> 00:16:40,580
Is she all right?

157
00:16:40,605 --> 00:16:42,050
She just passed out!

158
00:16:42,075 --> 00:16:43,502
Matt, quick, call an ambulance!

159
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,848
Ayaka, please...!

160
00:16:44,873 --> 00:16:45,651
Is she drunk?

161
00:16:45,692 --> 00:16:48,035
No, she wasn't drinking! Ayaka!

162
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,330
Wake up!

163
00:16:49,405 --> 00:16:50,738
Ayaka!

164
00:16:56,415 --> 00:17:02,421
Well, you see, in these changing
times, we need new public policy,

165
00:17:02,977 --> 00:17:05,498
"PEOPLE FALLING UNCONCIOUS FOR NO APPARENT REASON"

166
00:17:08,623 --> 00:17:12,338
Thanks, guys. I know how busy you
all are. I appreciate you coming.

167
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:13,077
Digimon!

168
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:15,664
It's an emergency. So let's get to it then.

169
00:17:16,186 --> 00:17:18,462
All right, gather around my monitor.

170
00:17:21,447 --> 00:17:25,552
Hola! It's Yolei checking in!
I'm in Spain studying abroad.

171
00:17:25,882 --> 00:17:27,527
The paella here is so gooood!

172
00:17:27,552 --> 00:17:29,581
The camera can't focus if you move like that!

173
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:33,278
Aw, Hawkmon, your camerawork stinks. Give me that!

174
00:17:33,389 --> 00:17:34,335
Well, don't smudge it!!

175
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:37,423
Like I said, I'm studying abroad in Spain.

176
00:17:37,543 --> 00:17:41,827
I was checking out the local Digimon
community here. And then I got this email.

177
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,430
Yolei, you're zooming in too much.

178
00:17:44,744 --> 00:17:45,791
Good. That's better.

179
00:17:45,989 --> 00:17:49,448
I didn't know what to do with it, so I
thought I'd just pawn it off on... I mean...

180
00:17:49,495 --> 00:17:52,665
just run it by the old IzMaster to help me figure it out.

181
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,173
You know... by himself.

182
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,049
I mean I'm really busy out here.

183
00:17:56,446 --> 00:18:00,704
So, thanks for understanding and I'll
have an extra helping of paella for you!

184
00:18:00,934 --> 00:18:02,347
Adios!

185
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:06,948
She said, "Pawn it off."

186
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,498
So then... What does the message say?

187
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:14,460
Rather than explain it myself, I think we
should hear it straight from the source itself.

188
00:18:14,608 --> 00:18:17,070
Huh? You mean there's somebody else here too?

189
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:19,310
Okay! You can come in now!

190
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,015
Huh?

191
00:18:27,613 --> 00:18:29,544
Good morning, DigiDestined!

192
00:18:29,694 --> 00:18:32,682
It's nice to meet you all. I'm Menoa Bellucci

193
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,003
...associate professor at New York's Belica University.

194
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:40,619
And I'm her assistant, Kyotaro Imura. Nice to meet you.

195
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,302
Nice to meet you.

196
00:18:42,437 --> 00:18:45,891
Welcome to Japan, Menoa. If you need
a guide while you're here, let me know.

197
00:18:46,356 --> 00:18:47,014
Thank you!

198
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:52,753
We're both specialists in a new branch of science
we're developing at Belica called Digimon Research.

199
00:18:54,157 --> 00:18:56,367
We'd like your help in an investigation.

200
00:18:56,446 --> 00:18:59,480
We're hoping you'll help us solve
a certain incident we discovered.

201
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:04,309
You're heroes after all... having
saved the world countless times.

202
00:19:05,058 --> 00:19:07,345
So you've done your homework, I see.

203
00:19:07,845 --> 00:19:10,146
Oh, we're excellent researchers.

204
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:15,397
We're here because we need your help with a mass
coma phenomenon that's currently occurring worldwide.

205
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:24,177
A number of people around the globe have suddenly
gone comatose with no explanation and no warning.

206
00:19:24,324 --> 00:19:28,552
So far, worldwide, there have
been over 300 confirmed cases!

207
00:19:28,973 --> 00:19:31,762
We didn't see a pattern at first, but then we noticed that

208
00:19:31,787 --> 00:19:34,383
all the victims had something particular in common.

209
00:19:34,615 --> 00:19:35,376
They're all...

210
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:37,543
Don't tell me, they're all DigiDestined.

211
00:19:37,865 --> 00:19:39,129
Yeah, that's right.

212
00:19:39,247 --> 00:19:41,767
You're as smart as they say. Izzy, I'm impressed.

213
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:45,459
Well, I guess if I wasn't so smart
you guys wouldn't be here, would you?

214
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:50,552
Anyway... Lately I've lost touch with
a number of DigiDestined in my database.

215
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:53,292
I was wondering what had happened to them.

216
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:56,534
So far, none of them have regained consciousness.

217
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:59,806
And their Digimon partners have also suddenly disappeared.

218
00:20:00,195 --> 00:20:01,307
They just vanished.

219
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:02,568
No way.

220
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,032
Where'd they all go?

221
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:10,905
At all four sites we investigated, we detected traces
of the missing Digimon in the form of a digital noise.

222
00:20:11,691 --> 00:20:14,966
So, whoever's behind this, is after the Digimon.

223
00:20:14,997 --> 00:20:17,927
Yes. We're positive that's what they're after...

224
00:20:18,422 --> 00:20:25,072
We analyzed the noise pattern, and after
performing a trace... we found the Digimon behind this.

225
00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:31,863
However, it seems that the data pattern of this
Digimon differs from those in the Digital World.

226
00:20:32,253 --> 00:20:33,603
So then it's...!

227
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:35,664
A new...

228
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,316
...Digimon...

229
00:20:39,437 --> 00:20:43,480
Right. We're calling it... Eosmon.

230
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:45,843
Eosmon?

231
00:20:45,935 --> 00:20:48,880
It's the first of its kind to be identified by us,

232
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,351
so I decided to name it after Eos, a
Titan who was the Greek goddess of the dawn.

233
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:59,165
It goes without saying, there's no way we can just
stand around waiting and let this to continue to happen.

234
00:20:59,435 --> 00:21:02,892
A Digimon that robs DigiDestined of their consciousness...

235
00:21:03,432 --> 00:21:06,206
However, the good news is we can save them.

236
00:21:06,777 --> 00:21:11,370
It seems Eosmon robs people's
consciousness by somehow digitizing it.

237
00:21:11,554 --> 00:21:16,781
And then... it saves the data in
cyberspace, in a location only it knows.

238
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:17,831
So then...

239
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:18,720
So then...

240
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:23,844
If we defeat Eosmon, and salvage their
consciousness data from cyberspace...

241
00:21:23,931 --> 00:21:25,813
We can save every last one.

242
00:21:26,234 --> 00:21:30,756
We're here because there's nowhere else
to turn! We desperately need you to help us!

243
00:21:31,065 --> 00:21:33,624
Then we can't say no! Am I right guys?

244
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,530
Yeah. But just remember... All those
people's lives are on the line here.

245
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:41,526
This calls for a carefully crafted thought-out plan.

246
00:21:41,756 --> 00:21:44,760
But we both know that we don't have the time for that.

247
00:21:44,785 --> 00:21:47,844
Which is why... we already came up with one ourselves.

248
00:21:48,201 --> 00:21:50,712
We're here to assist you in any way possible.

249
00:21:50,991 --> 00:21:53,095
Let us know if there's anything we can do.

250
00:21:57,951 --> 00:22:00,485
Guys, does everyone know what they're supposed to do?

251
00:22:00,722 --> 00:22:03,137
Relax, I told you, we got this!

252
00:22:05,427 --> 00:22:07,937
Hello! Can everybody hear me?

253
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:11,616
Loud and clear! Are you ready
to receive the consciousness data?

254
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:16,026
We're banking on the theoretical
possibility we can restore their

255
00:22:16,051 --> 00:22:19,005
consciousness if we get all their data from cyberspace.

256
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:21,573
Okay, you're almost there.

257
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,974
Is everyone ready?

258
00:22:23,168 --> 00:22:25,577
Yeah, we'll get this done in no time!

259
00:22:25,648 --> 00:22:27,617
Good to see you've learned nothing, Tai.

260
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,507
Good luck!

261
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,221
Transmission complete.

262
00:22:42,396 --> 00:22:42,807
Hm.

263
00:22:47,846 --> 00:22:50,030
Execute mission phase two.

264
00:22:50,141 --> 00:22:52,037
Commence backup of area data.

265
00:22:52,231 --> 00:22:55,099
Position... identified, transferring enclosure.

266
00:22:57,262 --> 00:22:58,712
Okay, let's begin.

267
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:17,028
Wide-area enclosure expansion at 100%.

268
00:23:17,988 --> 00:23:19,107
Activate.

269
00:23:29,847 --> 00:23:35,647
Enclosure complete. Now you can salvage
the data, if you do your job right.

270
00:23:35,878 --> 00:23:38,160
Who does this joker think he's talking to?

271
00:23:38,207 --> 00:23:40,979
All we gotta do is smack that thing down.

272
00:23:41,026 --> 00:23:41,923
Let's go!

273
00:24:04,812 --> 00:24:05,844
It's too fast!

274
00:24:05,981 --> 00:24:07,729
Yes, but it can still be caught!

275
00:24:07,836 --> 00:24:08,554
Do it!

276
00:24:25,884 --> 00:24:26,832
We got it!

277
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:27,599
Over here!

278
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,559
Finish it!

279
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:33,972
What is this!?

280
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,083
What's happening...!?

281
00:24:39,057 --> 00:24:40,613
It's digivolving.

282
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,251
Eosmon has...

283
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,309
it digivolved.

284
00:25:01,753 --> 00:25:02,866
Who cares!?

285
00:25:03,032 --> 00:25:05,029
Yeah, it's still going down!

286
00:25:10,469 --> 00:25:11,399
Greymon!

287
00:25:11,546 --> 00:25:12,798
Garurumon!

288
00:25:15,476 --> 00:25:16,755
It had no effect!

289
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:21,286
Moth scales...! It excretes a type of
moth scale that deflects our attacks.

290
00:25:21,618 --> 00:25:22,514
Even this?

291
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:28,800
What!?

292
00:25:31,057 --> 00:25:32,145
Angemon!

293
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:35,044
It's too fast!

294
00:25:36,092 --> 00:25:38,199
Those panels that it keeps launching off of...

295
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:39,724
It's for acceleration.

296
00:25:39,787 --> 00:25:41,128
I'll stop it!

297
00:25:42,034 --> 00:25:43,272
...No I won't!

298
00:25:47,072 --> 00:25:48,313
Kabuterimon!

299
00:25:48,796 --> 00:25:50,925
Menoa...! Is the area backup done?

300
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,919
Sixty-two percent. No! We need more time!

301
00:25:53,944 --> 00:25:55,921
Tai, it's time we go all out!

302
00:25:55,946 --> 00:25:57,569
Right! Let's go!

303
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,200
What's happening...?

304
00:26:21,305 --> 00:26:22,849
It's Omnimon.

305
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:32,485
Go!

306
00:26:45,248 --> 00:26:46,393
It's too fast!

307
00:26:46,418 --> 00:26:49,236
That's why Omnimon's trying to anticipate it's next move.

308
00:27:08,207 --> 00:27:09,248
Come on!

309
00:27:16,749 --> 00:27:19,218
Now, Omnimon! Finish it!

310
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:46,302
What's wrong?

311
00:27:46,494 --> 00:27:47,516
Omnimon!

312
00:27:57,097 --> 00:28:01,702
What in the Digital World...? Why'd
Omnimon break apart? Izzy, what happened?

313
00:28:01,733 --> 00:28:05,340
How should I know? Somehow they
reverted to their In-Training level?

314
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,247
Tsunomon!

315
00:28:06,898 --> 00:28:08,200
Could it be...?

316
00:28:13,015 --> 00:28:14,063
It's trying to get away!

317
00:28:14,088 --> 00:28:15,257
I'll stop it!

318
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:18,838
Angemon!

319
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,681
Izzy, I'm going to...

320
00:28:20,854 --> 00:28:22,188
Kabuterimon!

321
00:28:22,916 --> 00:28:23,460
Huh?

322
00:28:29,396 --> 00:28:31,320
Oh no, it's getting away!

323
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:54,966
I don't get it!

324
00:28:55,997 --> 00:28:58,769
Why did Omnimon's fusion suddenly break apart?

325
00:28:58,848 --> 00:29:00,151
It doesn't make sense...

326
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:02,718
even if he sustained significant damage.

327
00:29:03,337 --> 00:29:06,978
But even worse, two of our Digimon
reverted to their In-Training level.

328
00:29:07,348 --> 00:29:09,972
We just have to regroup and get back on our feet.

329
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:11,234
Back on our feet?!

330
00:29:12,236 --> 00:29:15,070
Just look at them. What're we supposed to do?

331
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:24,064
Guys... Let's focus on Eosmon
and locating the consciousness data.

332
00:29:24,334 --> 00:29:27,751
Don't worry. I'll look into
why Omnimon's fusion broke apart.

333
00:29:28,021 --> 00:29:31,644
It could be, something in cyberspace
may be inhibiting digivolutions...

334
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:32,360
No.

335
00:29:32,677 --> 00:29:33,290
Huh?

336
00:29:33,545 --> 00:29:34,282
Huh?

337
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,380
What do you mean?

338
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,255
And how do you know?

339
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:45,348
All I can say... is that's your problem.

340
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:47,247
Didn't know we had one.

341
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,559
Please explain yourself.

342
00:29:49,729 --> 00:29:53,852
Do you know why Digimon partners
pick the children they work with?

343
00:29:55,622 --> 00:29:59,156
It's because they're full of potential.

344
00:30:00,436 --> 00:30:01,467
"Potential?"

345
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,638
The possibilities are endless...

346
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:07,778
Their choice results in growth.

347
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:13,823
And that growth and potential
produces an enormous amount of energy.

348
00:30:15,427 --> 00:30:17,279
Surely you understand.

349
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,035
Your growth was the trigger...

350
00:30:20,503 --> 00:30:23,706
For your partner Digimon to be able to Digivolve.

351
00:30:24,786 --> 00:30:29,886
As we live our lives, the choices we make help us grow.

352
00:30:30,751 --> 00:30:36,504
But as you grow older, the power
of your Digimon steadily dwindles.

353
00:30:38,285 --> 00:30:46,341
And once it's gone... the bond between
Digimon and partner... is broken forever.

354
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:51,386
I don't get it.

355
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,657
You mean we just leave and go our separate ways?

356
00:30:53,682 --> 00:30:55,286
What!? No way!

357
00:30:55,373 --> 00:30:57,432
I'm afraid I don't follow either.

358
00:30:57,543 --> 00:30:59,090
It's just like I said...

359
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,856
How come I didn't know any of this?

360
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:03,622
You guys don't have a monopoly on all-things Digimon.

361
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:05,338
But how come you know about this?

362
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:12,464
The first sign is an inability to
digivolve successfully to the next level.

363
00:31:12,552 --> 00:31:13,796
Agumon!

364
00:31:13,821 --> 00:31:14,337
Yeah?

365
00:31:14,718 --> 00:31:17,231
Let's go! Eosmon is ours!

366
00:31:17,597 --> 00:31:18,892
No, don't.

367
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:22,647
Forcing your partner to digivolve
accelerates your separation!

368
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:23,708
You don't know that!

369
00:31:24,671 --> 00:31:25,853
Let's go, Agumon!

370
00:31:30,741 --> 00:31:33,362
What in the.... huh?

371
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,348
I'm sorry, but that proves it.

372
00:31:37,451 --> 00:31:41,178
That ring of light is the last
link to your Digimon partner.

373
00:31:42,162 --> 00:31:45,484
Once it's gone, you'll go your separate ways.

374
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:55,679
This isn't fair.

375
00:32:00,437 --> 00:32:02,241
I won't let this happen!

376
00:32:03,917 --> 00:32:05,115
Where are you going!?

377
00:32:05,371 --> 00:32:06,555
Wait, Matt!

378
00:32:08,571 --> 00:32:09,613
Poor Matt.

379
00:32:14,992 --> 00:32:23,183
This is awful. Does this mean we all have to...
say goodbye... to our Digimon once we grow up?

380
00:32:27,121 --> 00:32:32,836
I have to agree with Matt. I'm not gonna let
this happen, even if what you say is actually true.

381
00:32:33,097 --> 00:32:35,878
I'm going to find a way to fix this, no matter what.

382
00:32:36,513 --> 00:32:38,023
I know how you feel.

383
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:42,296
But this is just the way it
is. There's nothing you can do.

384
00:32:56,536 --> 00:32:57,941
Hey, Matt, look!

385
00:32:58,497 --> 00:32:58,846
Huh?

386
00:32:59,457 --> 00:33:00,760
Okay, on my way.

387
00:33:08,647 --> 00:33:09,915
Come on, Gabumon.

388
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:27,870
You know, Tai, I'd hate to be
comatose like those Digidestined.

389
00:33:28,262 --> 00:33:30,261
Think of all the meals I'd miss

390
00:33:30,848 --> 00:33:34,075
Don't worry. We're gonna find them, and save them.

391
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:36,792
You got that right! And you can count on me!

392
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:38,531
I know.

393
00:33:40,866 --> 00:33:45,950
Tai... is it true we have to say goodbye once you grow up?

394
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:58,521
I'm sorry, Tai.

395
00:33:59,593 --> 00:34:00,436
Agumon...

396
00:34:02,621 --> 00:34:04,575
Hey, let's eat.

397
00:34:05,484 --> 00:34:07,999
Rub-a-dub-dub... thanks for the grub!

398
00:34:18,788 --> 00:34:19,693
Great!

399
00:34:20,094 --> 00:34:21,528
Thank you for this food.

400
00:34:22,671 --> 00:34:24,995
So what made you want ramen so badly?

401
00:34:25,637 --> 00:34:28,832
I'm hoping to open a ramen shop right here one day!

402
00:34:28,925 --> 00:34:31,134
Consider this a "recon opp!"

403
00:34:31,241 --> 00:34:33,219
This is yummy, thanks, Ken.

404
00:34:33,244 --> 00:34:37,832
It's good, but you can get this kind of
ramen in Tokyo, and at a much cheaper price.

405
00:34:37,857 --> 00:34:39,362
Who asked for your opinion, Cody?!

406
00:34:39,387 --> 00:34:41,284
Come on Davis, I want some!

407
00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:44,945
I think I like Matt's ramen much better!

408
00:34:45,011 --> 00:34:45,797
Yummy!

409
00:34:45,873 --> 00:34:47,628
They're gonna kick us out of here!

410
00:34:50,904 --> 00:34:54,058
Looks like a telemarketer. What're you selling?

411
00:34:55,478 --> 00:34:58,483
Oh! Hi, Matt! I didn't recognize the number!

412
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:01,563
Yeah, it sure has been a while.

413
00:35:03,028 --> 00:35:05,336
Now?  I'm with Ken and Cody!

414
00:35:05,474 --> 00:35:08,606
We're just chillin' eating ramen in New York City!

415
00:35:09,327 --> 00:35:12,061
Yeah. T.K. told me you were there.

416
00:35:12,712 --> 00:35:16,980
Digital gates really come in handy!
They're like a free plane ticket!

417
00:35:17,837 --> 00:35:20,785
So have you noticed anything different about your D3s?

418
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:23,121
No. Not recently anyway.

419
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,162
Okay. Nevermind then.

420
00:35:25,574 --> 00:35:26,918
Why, is something up?

421
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:30,477
Actually, I have a favor to ask.

422
00:35:30,527 --> 00:35:31,845
A background check?

423
00:35:32,082 --> 00:35:36,476
He asked us to look into two
Menoa Bellucci and Kyotaro Imura.

424
00:35:37,007 --> 00:35:38,369
What does he want to know?

425
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:39,248
No idea.

426
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:42,028
Mmm! I smell a new case brewing!

427
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:44,514
Hey, Davis! I know who Bellucci is!

428
00:35:44,539 --> 00:35:45,126
Really?

429
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:49,863
Since she was little she's been known as a wiz
kid, skipping grades, entering college way early,

430
00:35:49,991 --> 00:35:52,267
and now she already has a Ph.D. and a patent.

431
00:35:52,292 --> 00:35:57,101
Good to know! Well, let's just get this over
with, so we can go to a Major League game in Chicago!

432
00:36:14,078 --> 00:36:15,826
Nice bachelor pad!

433
00:36:19,712 --> 00:36:20,892
Kinda small though.

434
00:36:20,926 --> 00:36:25,550
Who asked you!? Wait a minute... is this
really the first time you've been here?

435
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:28,277
Mm-hmm, I'd remember this smell.

436
00:36:28,617 --> 00:36:29,373
Ooof.

437
00:36:32,052 --> 00:36:34,347
The walls are really thin, so keep it down.

438
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,427
I think I'm gonna grab something to drink.

439
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:37,327
Uh, Tai...?

440
00:36:37,613 --> 00:36:38,152
Huh?

441
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,506
What are these things?

442
00:36:43,347 --> 00:36:46,304
They're nothing! They're not mine,
I'm just holding them for a friend!

443
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,165
If they're nothing, let me see them.

444
00:36:49,312 --> 00:36:51,014
Only grownups can look!

445
00:36:54,627 --> 00:36:56,713
Um, why are you so red?

446
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,594
You okay?

447
00:37:07,357 --> 00:37:08,119
Agumon...

448
00:37:08,273 --> 00:37:08,825
Huh?

449
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,825
We're never gonna grow apart, little buddy.

450
00:37:24,462 --> 00:37:25,305
Never.

451
00:37:28,124 --> 00:37:28,849
Huh?

452
00:37:30,252 --> 00:37:31,128
Ahh!

453
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:40,488
Long time no see.

454
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:41,998
Master Gennai!?

455
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:02,162
We know Menoa is kind of famous,
but... the other guy? Kyotaro?

456
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:06,396
We didn't find a single thing about him.
And I used the internet and everything!

457
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,552
I feel like I let Matt down.

458
00:38:08,717 --> 00:38:12,070
Maybe I should get him something.
Anybody know if he uses body spray?

459
00:38:12,284 --> 00:38:13,356
Hello!

460
00:38:13,444 --> 00:38:14,317
Huh?

461
00:38:14,589 --> 00:38:16,168
How's it been going, guys?

462
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:17,479
You're all looking well!

463
00:38:17,646 --> 00:38:20,064
Hey, Yolei. Thanks for coming so quick.

464
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,908
With a digital gate, Spain's practically next door!

465
00:38:23,042 --> 00:38:26,235
It's handy being only minutes away from New York City.

466
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,762
Well, now that the hello's are out of
the way, would you mind helping us out?

467
00:38:29,834 --> 00:38:33,386
Of course! That's why we came! So, what's the story?

468
00:38:33,473 --> 00:38:35,268
We're trying to find out some info...

469
00:38:35,618 --> 00:38:37,254
But we hit a dead end.

470
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:40,043
Maybe this calls for a different approach.

471
00:38:40,749 --> 00:38:43,475
What if we just went straight to the source?

472
00:38:43,983 --> 00:38:45,476
Oh, I get it.

473
00:38:45,652 --> 00:38:49,196
Cody, what your were thinking is that we
should take a look around her laboratory.

474
00:38:49,276 --> 00:38:52,279
And how're we supposed to that? The door's locked!

475
00:38:52,605 --> 00:38:53,414
Ta-da!

476
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:55,733
Jackpot!

477
00:38:55,758 --> 00:38:57,531
That opened a little too easily.

478
00:38:59,012 --> 00:39:00,819
Hello in there...?

479
00:39:03,544 --> 00:39:04,346
There it is.

480
00:39:04,697 --> 00:39:06,832
A little too many books if you ask me.

481
00:39:07,549 --> 00:39:10,519
Ok, now it's my turn to show what I can do.

482
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,169
Huh?

483
00:39:14,149 --> 00:39:16,405
What a pretty picture.

484
00:39:42,956 --> 00:39:45,893
What are they doing? They've been in there for awhile.

485
00:39:49,696 --> 00:39:52,022
Matt, I think Kyotaro's got a gun!

486
00:39:55,701 --> 00:39:58,761
So then it's true...? Our partnerships do end.

487
00:39:59,404 --> 00:40:04,179
I'm afraid so Tai, and I'm sorry that
this is the way you had to find out about it.

488
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,804
Why am I just hearing about this now?

489
00:40:06,864 --> 00:40:10,788
For the same reason why people don't like
to talk about how long they have to live.

490
00:40:18,533 --> 00:40:20,425
Then this ring on my digivice...?

491
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:24,502
That's right. It shows how much time
you have left together as partners.

492
00:40:28,242 --> 00:40:34,623
Once our partnership ends,
will... I mean... Agumon will...

493
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:37,396
What exactly happens?

494
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,980
Once the ring is gone, your Digimon will likely vanish.

495
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:49,735
Unless... if you still have some potential locked away...

496
00:40:51,506 --> 00:40:52,382
Otherwise...

497
00:41:03,058 --> 00:41:07,374
Okay, Palmon, let's finish doing
this inventory. The sooner, the better!

498
00:41:07,668 --> 00:41:08,430
Okay!

499
00:41:10,988 --> 00:41:13,971
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

500
00:41:14,857 --> 00:41:16,908
Mimi, I think you have a phone call!

501
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:19,887
Yeah, I hear it! Hold on one sec...

502
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,798
I'm hungry again, Kari.

503
00:41:26,582 --> 00:41:28,014
Mmm, I'm kinda hungry too.

504
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,802
You're not looking too good, Matt.

505
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,630
You haven't had any sleep for hours!

506
00:41:47,986 --> 00:41:50,716
You really need to get some shut-eye, or you'll pass out!

507
00:41:50,785 --> 00:41:52,572
It's nothing that I can't handle.

508
00:41:52,945 --> 00:41:54,745
Plus, we're in crisis mode.

509
00:41:54,836 --> 00:41:55,757
Hmmm.

510
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:58,816
Huh?

511
00:42:02,723 --> 00:42:03,376
Joe...!

512
00:42:05,791 --> 00:42:08,208
Someone reported a loud noise from the warehouse...

513
00:42:08,351 --> 00:42:12,593
And when the police finally got there...
they found Mimi collapsed all alone.

514
00:42:13,585 --> 00:42:14,952
What's wrong with her, Joe?

515
00:42:15,111 --> 00:42:16,192
We don't know yet.

516
00:42:16,581 --> 00:42:18,878
There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with her at all...

517
00:42:19,376 --> 00:42:21,347
except for being unconscious.

518
00:42:22,602 --> 00:42:25,456
Eosmon... It's got to be him.

519
00:42:28,481 --> 00:42:31,271
Tai, Izzy... I need to talk to you.

520
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,665
We could've talked anywhere... Why in here?

521
00:42:36,228 --> 00:42:38,188
Because there are no cameras in here.

522
00:42:38,429 --> 00:42:40,324
So you think we're being watched?

523
00:42:40,512 --> 00:42:44,468
It's just in case... Pre-paid burner phones.

524
00:42:47,184 --> 00:42:48,837
Your smartphones are traceable.

525
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:51,904
Burner phones... What are we, spies?

526
00:42:52,214 --> 00:42:54,461
Let's brief each other on what we've been up to.

527
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:57,823
Good idea. I want to know what you two have been doing.

528
00:42:58,228 --> 00:42:59,833
I met with Master Gennai.

529
00:43:00,659 --> 00:43:01,824
What did he say to you?

530
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:05,745
Anything about how to stop the ring from
fading, or at least how to slow it down?!

531
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:20,158
We can mope about it later.

532
00:43:21,095 --> 00:43:21,977
What's this?

533
00:43:22,453 --> 00:43:23,947
Check out that bottom photo.

534
00:43:26,578 --> 00:43:29,072
By her side... is that a Digimon?!

535
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:30,797
Yeah... no doubt.

536
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:34,386
So that means Menoa is a DigiDestined, just like us!

537
00:43:34,616 --> 00:43:38,342
The fact that her Digimon partner
hasn't revealed itself means -

538
00:43:38,596 --> 00:43:43,020
I don't know. There's something even
more suspicious. Menoa's assistant.

539
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:43,761
The big guy?

540
00:43:44,055 --> 00:43:45,412
Check out page two.

541
00:43:46,842 --> 00:43:52,023
Kyotaro started working for her around the same
time she announced her research findings about Digimon.

542
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:53,811
Right after.

543
00:43:54,104 --> 00:43:58,769
I don't know who he is or what he wants...
but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

544
00:43:59,189 --> 00:44:00,922
I don't like being made a fool of.

545
00:44:01,185 --> 00:44:03,029
We'll leave him all to you then, Matt.

546
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,678
I'm currently analyzing the Eosmon fragments
we recovered. And I'm doing my best to locate it.

547
00:44:09,107 --> 00:44:10,147
How's that going?

548
00:44:10,306 --> 00:44:12,085
No luck at all, so far.

549
00:44:12,297 --> 00:44:17,021
Just in case, I've already issued a warning
to all the DigiDestined in the database.

550
00:44:17,566 --> 00:44:20,705
Thanks, Iz. Be careful out there, okay?

551
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:23,826
Try limiting your contact with the outside if you can.

552
00:44:24,406 --> 00:44:25,939
Yeah, I... I know.

553
00:44:26,566 --> 00:44:31,001
Guys if... If we can't... I
mean this could be the last time...

554
00:44:31,977 --> 00:44:33,321
We have to win.

555
00:44:41,133 --> 00:44:44,626
Oh, Sora, shouldn't we be joining the others?

556
00:44:46,088 --> 00:44:49,027
I already decided... I wasn't going to fight.

557
00:44:51,003 --> 00:44:53,810
I'm going to stay right here with you, Biyomon.

558
00:45:42,051 --> 00:45:42,654
Huh?

559
00:45:48,992 --> 00:45:50,839
So... what brings you here?

560
00:45:50,961 --> 00:45:53,537
There's something I wanted to talk to you about in person.

561
00:45:53,725 --> 00:45:54,447
I see.

562
00:45:54,636 --> 00:45:57,750
We know you're Digidestined. With a Digimon partner.

563
00:45:58,196 --> 00:46:01,065
Yeah, I am. Her name's Morphomon.

564
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:06,396
We met when I was nine and right away we were inseparable.

565
00:46:07,334 --> 00:46:10,322
I even took her with me to school and on trips.

566
00:46:10,964 --> 00:46:15,890
No matter where I went or what
I did... she was always with me.

567
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:20,809
I have such fond memories.

568
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:22,471
And now?

569
00:46:22,772 --> 00:46:25,578
And now it's been eight years since our partnership ended.

570
00:46:26,006 --> 00:46:33,536
Like you guys... I didn't know it would
happen, and when it did... I was confused, and sad.

571
00:46:34,068 --> 00:46:35,736
Sorry, I didn't know.

572
00:46:35,868 --> 00:46:39,876
I don't want others to have to
experience that same sad farewell.

573
00:46:40,996 --> 00:46:45,676
I mean, don't you think that it's rather
unfair... they'll leave once we grow up?

574
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:50,358
That's why I research. There's so
much more to learn about Digimon.

575
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,655
So then... you don't know how to keep
us from losing our Digimon partners?

576
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:59,008
Sorry. I would've already told you if I did.

577
00:47:02,855 --> 00:47:06,612
Why'd you come? Why'd you even
approach us in the first place?

578
00:47:08,223 --> 00:47:10,679
Simple, because you're the best team.

579
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:18,925
So... If anyone can do it, it's
you and the original Digidestined.

580
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:20,687
I believe in you.

581
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:32,639
Come on.

582
00:47:43,174 --> 00:47:44,628
Look, Matt... on the wall!

583
00:47:45,183 --> 00:47:46,167
What is that?

584
00:47:54,634 --> 00:47:56,902
Quick, Matt, we gotta go tell the others!

585
00:47:59,396 --> 00:48:00,244
Yeah, hello?

586
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:02,249
Yes, I'm looking for a... Matt?

587
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,405
Davis, is this a secure call?

588
00:48:05,034 --> 00:48:10,080
Safe and secure! I'm calling from a
public payphone, just like you told me to!

589
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,656
Excellent. Got any results on your end?

590
00:48:12,706 --> 00:48:15,980
We hit the jackpot! Where should I start?

591
00:48:16,551 --> 00:48:18,005
Start with her assistant.

592
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:20,430
That guy is as shady as they come, believe me.

593
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:23,166
Who even knows if his real name is Kyotaro Imura?

594
00:48:23,336 --> 00:48:24,391
What do you mean?

595
00:48:24,899 --> 00:48:30,894
Yolei, here. We were able to hack into Menoa's
office computer, which was chock full of research files.

596
00:48:31,147 --> 00:48:34,355
While her assistant's laptop was suspiciously empty.

597
00:48:34,809 --> 00:48:39,509
But I found evidence of a ton of data on
Eosman being wiped clean from his hard drive.

598
00:48:39,607 --> 00:48:40,425
Really?

599
00:48:41,408 --> 00:48:45,022
Ken here. I thought it was fishy, so I dug even deeper...

600
00:48:45,072 --> 00:48:49,641
but there were no records of anyone
named Kyotaro Imura. It must be an alias.

601
00:48:51,506 --> 00:48:54,513
It's like this guy doesn't even exist in the real world.

602
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:55,877
Not that I could find.

603
00:48:56,439 --> 00:49:00,065
Maybe Menoa... is being used by him in some way.

604
00:49:00,661 --> 00:49:05,587
I don't know. But would someone
like her... as brilliant as she is...

605
00:49:05,694 --> 00:49:08,153
really allow herself to be used like that?

606
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:10,555
She's so pretty, if I'm still allowed to say that.

607
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:15,049
I'll tell ya what was purty, it was
that picture of Aurora, in Menoa's room.

608
00:49:15,295 --> 00:49:16,161
Aurora?

609
00:49:16,414 --> 00:49:18,338
The Roman goddess of the dawn.

610
00:49:19,211 --> 00:49:21,795
Armadillomon is simply obsessed with her.

611
00:49:22,503 --> 00:49:23,740
The goddess of dawn...

612
00:49:23,765 --> 00:49:25,252
I taught him all about her!

613
00:49:25,381 --> 00:49:26,086
 Aurora?

614
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,597
You wouldn't know a goddess from a bodice.

615
00:49:29,176 --> 00:49:31,468
Okay, anything else I should hear?

616
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:34,658
Yeah! Take us out for our favorite
sushi when we get back, your treat!

617
00:49:34,683 --> 00:49:36,264
Let's make it All-you-can-eat!

618
00:49:38,717 --> 00:49:40,959
It'll be arranged. Thanks, guys.

619
00:49:41,499 --> 00:49:42,547
Let's go, Gabumon.

620
00:49:42,572 --> 00:49:43,350
Right, Matt.

621
00:49:44,971 --> 00:49:48,218
Wow... I never expected to find this...

622
00:49:48,467 --> 00:49:50,620
after analyzing Eosmon's data.

623
00:49:51,024 --> 00:49:53,814
So... this series of incidents is...

624
00:49:53,869 --> 00:49:56,332
Izzy... any empty plastic bottles?

625
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:01,209
Kari? I wonder what she sent.

626
00:50:05,598 --> 00:50:07,448
Which one next? What?

627
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:09,409
Huh?

628
00:50:10,553 --> 00:50:12,427
So, no recyclables?

629
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:14,444
This is bad...

630
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,249
Izzy, which way should we go?

631
00:50:19,275 --> 00:50:21,651
Hiroo! That's where Kari's being held!

632
00:50:22,072 --> 00:50:22,914
And T.K.?

633
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,122
Matt is on his way to Nerima right now!

634
00:50:25,718 --> 00:50:29,793
Tai... I can't get through to Joe. Be careful out there.

635
00:50:30,223 --> 00:50:31,255
Joe too?

636
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,470
Slow down!

637
00:50:39,534 --> 00:50:40,383
Hang on!

638
00:50:40,716 --> 00:50:43,578
We stick together no matter what happens, right?

639
00:50:45,514 --> 00:50:46,819
No matter what!

640
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,357
Let's do this, Gabumon!

641
00:51:03,271 --> 00:51:05,670
I only hope that they're not too late.

642
00:51:06,925 --> 00:51:07,657
Huh?

643
00:51:10,805 --> 00:51:12,836
Wait a minute... that's not...

644
00:51:12,937 --> 00:51:14,643
Did you locate Eosmon, Izzy?

645
00:51:14,937 --> 00:51:20,364
Yes, but this is... there's way
too much... There's way too much data!

646
00:51:21,826 --> 00:51:23,446
You found Eosmon?!

647
00:51:24,795 --> 00:51:25,464
Menoa?

648
00:51:30,579 --> 00:51:33,065
What took you so long? I've been waiting.

649
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,655
It's a trap.

650
00:51:35,131 --> 00:51:36,577
What are you doing here?

651
00:51:36,953 --> 00:51:41,442
I'm on to your pathetic attempt to
sniff me out and expose my evil plan.

652
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:44,667
But unfortunately though... you're too late.

653
00:51:51,524 --> 00:51:52,834
I'm impressed!

654
00:51:53,063 --> 00:51:56,746
If we can locate Eosmon, we'll
find the consciousness data.

655
00:51:57,227 --> 00:52:02,352
And if we're able to defeat it, we can save
the three hundred people it stole the date from!

656
00:52:02,779 --> 00:52:04,106
I'm too late?

657
00:52:04,838 --> 00:52:09,860
That's right. While you were out playing
detective, Eosman just struck again.

658
00:52:10,146 --> 00:52:12,629
He robbed your brother of his consciousness.

659
00:52:12,783 --> 00:52:13,553
T.K.?!

660
00:52:14,101 --> 00:52:16,437
Wait, Matt. He could be behind it!

661
00:52:16,628 --> 00:52:19,481
Yeah! How do we know it wasn't you?!

662
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:20,862
Menoa?

663
00:52:21,926 --> 00:52:22,744
What is it?

664
00:52:23,396 --> 00:52:25,057
What exactly are you here?

665
00:52:25,128 --> 00:52:28,529
Oh, right. I forgot to tell you,
I found a way to save everyone!

666
00:52:28,989 --> 00:52:33,512
All I need from you is your database of
DigiDestined, and I should be able to do it right away!

667
00:52:33,876 --> 00:52:36,261
Can I have it? Shouldn't take long.

668
00:52:36,847 --> 00:52:38,388
Let T.K. go, now!

669
00:52:38,516 --> 00:52:39,826
Or I swear...

670
00:52:41,299 --> 00:52:43,575
Wait. Matt, you've got it wrong. I'm not who...

671
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:50,417
Don't play dumb! You used Eosmon to rob those
DigiDestined of their consciousness, didn't you?!

672
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:55,589
Let me show you something.

673
00:52:55,788 --> 00:53:03,136
Menoa... When we were battling it out in
cyberspace... I managed to recover a piece of Eosman.

674
00:53:06,998 --> 00:53:07,871
Did you, now?

675
00:53:08,253 --> 00:53:15,404
Eosman contains a number of formulae
that had to be written by a human being.

676
00:53:17,454 --> 00:53:21,276
And when I looked into them deeper...
it led me to a certain someone.

677
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,549
...Menoa Bellucci.

678
00:53:26,017 --> 00:53:30,617
Eosmon is an artificial Digimon...
created by none other than you!

679
00:53:42,394 --> 00:53:45,914
I guess you really are... as smart as they say.

680
00:53:46,636 --> 00:53:47,724
FBI?

681
00:53:47,818 --> 00:53:50,576
That's right, I'm Agent Kyotaro Yamada.

682
00:53:51,164 --> 00:53:52,378
So then...

683
00:53:52,783 --> 00:53:54,740
I'm on the side of the law, Matt.

684
00:53:55,049 --> 00:53:57,749
Whoa! I guess we were wrong about him!

685
00:53:58,329 --> 00:54:00,003
Yeah, it seems so.

686
00:54:00,299 --> 00:54:02,946
I can see why you were mistaken. It's the haircut.

687
00:54:03,399 --> 00:54:05,893
Well, then why the heck is the FBI involved?

688
00:54:06,727 --> 00:54:09,850
Because of this... right here.

689
00:54:10,326 --> 00:54:13,102
So then she is the person behind all of this!

690
00:54:13,127 --> 00:54:15,811
She used Eosmon to steal their consciousness.

691
00:54:16,248 --> 00:54:18,068
Tell me, Menoa... Why did you...

692
00:54:18,093 --> 00:54:19,610
I did it for all of you.

693
00:54:21,225 --> 00:54:22,111
T.K....

694
00:54:24,391 --> 00:54:26,790
He was unconscious when I first got to him.

695
00:54:27,687 --> 00:54:33,487
Menoa has been on the FBI's radar for several years
now... but we never had enough evidence against her.

696
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:37,229
I wanted to be the one to arrest her with my own hands...

697
00:54:39,974 --> 00:54:44,136
But she's made a fool of the FBI
again. Which was one of her objectives.

698
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:50,005
She's with Izzy.

699
00:54:50,148 --> 00:54:52,881
What do you mean... you did it for us?

700
00:54:55,032 --> 00:54:58,395
That's the reason you robbed
everybody of their consciousness?!

701
00:54:58,624 --> 00:55:01,700
No one in their right mind
would ask you to do that for them!

702
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,703
Yes. They all did.

703
00:55:07,561 --> 00:55:08,927
Every one of them.

704
00:55:11,798 --> 00:55:12,718
Izzy!

705
00:55:15,039 --> 00:55:16,015
Oh no!

706
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:17,506
We're too late.

707
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:19,816
I'm sorry!

708
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,156
Tentomon's not here!

709
00:55:21,259 --> 00:55:23,739
No good. The list has been stolen.

710
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:28,528
Kyotaro, what is Menoa up to?

711
00:55:28,837 --> 00:55:34,948
I don't know. But many times she said she
wanted to save the DigiDestined if she was able to.

712
00:55:35,639 --> 00:55:38,992
Does she really think that this is saving us?

713
00:55:41,113 --> 00:55:43,028
Any idea where she might be?

714
00:55:43,624 --> 00:55:44,237
No.

715
00:55:45,682 --> 00:55:48,019
After all this there's nothing I can do...

716
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:50,061
It's not over yet.

717
00:55:52,513 --> 00:55:54,311
Do you know something that we don't?

718
00:55:55,207 --> 00:55:58,259
Take a look at this. It's a message from Izzy.

719
00:56:00,047 --> 00:56:01,858
What do all those different numbers mean.

720
00:56:02,215 --> 00:56:03,626
Those are coordinates.

721
00:56:03,962 --> 00:56:06,043
Coordinates in the Digital World.

722
00:56:08,651 --> 00:56:10,186
But there's nothing out there.

723
00:56:10,511 --> 00:56:11,448
Nothing at all.

724
00:56:11,622 --> 00:56:15,447
Well if Izzy left those coordinates...
that means Menoa has to be there!

725
00:56:15,944 --> 00:56:18,097
Uh... you with us Matt?

726
00:56:19,512 --> 00:56:20,313
You okay?

727
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:23,597
I don't know... You sure about this, Tai?

728
00:56:24,272 --> 00:56:26,091
The second we find Menoa...

729
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:30,134
...Is the second we'll have to fight her and Eosmon.

730
00:56:30,652 --> 00:56:33,941
And at that same second our
partners will have to digivolve...

731
00:56:34,592 --> 00:56:37,373
And that will only speed up their goodbyes!

732
00:56:39,158 --> 00:56:43,831
Even so... we can't just abandon all
those who lost consciousness forever.

733
00:56:47,394 --> 00:56:50,745
So you're...  okay with that?

734
00:56:57,948 --> 00:56:59,839
No, I'm not.

735
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:04,116
But still, someone's gotta do it!

736
00:57:11,773 --> 00:57:15,017
So, this is my fate.

737
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:19,003
Opening a digital gate.

738
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:22,379
Try to make it back... in one piece, okay?

739
00:57:22,506 --> 00:57:23,022
Mmh!

740
00:57:40,764 --> 00:57:42,426
What is this place?

741
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:44,681
Is this the Digital World?

742
00:57:47,623 --> 00:57:48,511
What's that?

743
00:57:48,928 --> 00:57:50,124
Let's check it out.

744
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:55,461
What's this made out of?

745
00:57:55,898 --> 00:57:57,774
I think it's crystal.

746
00:57:58,179 --> 00:58:00,243
Hey, Matt, isn't this the train?

747
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:02,326
The one that goes to File Island?

748
00:58:02,564 --> 00:58:06,331
I think you're right. But...
it's a totally different material.

749
00:58:06,863 --> 00:58:08,794
What in the world's going on?

750
00:58:15,293 --> 00:58:17,311
I'm impressed you were able to find me.

751
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,238
Where's the database that you stole?

752
00:58:20,352 --> 00:58:21,848
Yeah, hand it over.

753
00:58:25,369 --> 00:58:31,261
Okay... but maybe we should
ask everyone else. What d'ya say?

754
00:58:34,497 --> 00:58:35,589
What's happening?!

755
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:52,529
What is this place!?

756
00:58:52,608 --> 00:58:53,849
Look over there!

757
00:58:58,211 --> 00:58:59,036
Kari...

758
00:59:03,136 --> 00:59:04,233
T.K....

759
00:59:05,574 --> 00:59:06,314
Mimi...

760
00:59:07,284 --> 00:59:08,118
Joe...

761
00:59:08,832 --> 00:59:09,737
Izzy...

762
00:59:11,137 --> 00:59:12,081
Meiko...

763
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:14,675
They've all become kids again!

764
00:59:14,746 --> 00:59:16,319
They're with their Digimon.

765
00:59:16,517 --> 00:59:18,097
All these DigiDestined...

766
00:59:19,901 --> 00:59:23,326
All of their memories... They're trapped in them!

767
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:26,392
Welcome to the Never World!

768
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:32,936
The perfect place to be a child forever.

769
00:59:33,616 --> 00:59:37,508
You call this place perfect!?
You forced them to come here!

770
00:59:38,048 --> 00:59:41,244
You're right. I am responsible for bringing them here.

771
00:59:42,012 --> 00:59:45,380
But, believe me, they wanted to come.

772
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:48,168
They don't want to grow up.

773
00:59:49,446 --> 00:59:50,954
They want to stay children.

774
00:59:51,807 --> 00:59:55,581
That wish of theirs is what drew
Eosmon to them in the first place.

775
00:59:56,169 --> 00:59:58,703
This is the only way.

776
00:59:59,356 --> 01:00:02,574
The only way for us DigiDestined to be happy forever.

777
01:00:03,916 --> 01:00:08,374
No one can stop a Digivice's
countdown ring. Believe me, I've tried.

778
01:00:08,992 --> 01:00:12,711
The fated farewell with our Digmon... is inevitable.

779
01:00:13,949 --> 01:00:19,623
However... if we return to our childhood...
we'll never have to leave our partners.

780
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:22,054
...We won't suffer all that pain...

781
01:00:23,697 --> 01:00:28,157
Tai... Matt... I can save you, too.

782
01:00:29,013 --> 01:00:32,729
Come join us. Join us in the Never World.

783
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:33,896
Tai, no!

784
01:00:33,896 --> 01:00:34,757
Don't, Matt!

785
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,012
Let's get this show on the road!

786
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:42,739
We've got work to do.

787
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:44,382
Save them all!

788
01:00:44,672 --> 01:00:45,586
All of them!

789
01:00:48,143 --> 01:00:50,235
Yeah, ready when you are!

790
01:00:51,573 --> 01:00:52,522
Oh, shoot.

791
01:00:57,275 --> 01:01:00,890
Fighting will only reduce the time
you have left with your partners.

792
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,426
Well, it's worth the risk if we stop you!

793
01:01:03,662 --> 01:01:05,846
So if this is our last time...!

794
01:01:06,109 --> 01:01:07,172
Greymon!

795
01:01:15,549 --> 01:01:17,082
We've got a two-on-one!

796
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:19,019
Let's use it then! Garurumon!

797
01:01:34,433 --> 01:01:35,211
Yes!

798
01:01:35,393 --> 01:01:38,676
It's all over, Menoa. We want everyone back.

799
01:01:39,414 --> 01:01:42,862
You think you won... but, you
just delayed things a little.

800
01:01:50,147 --> 01:01:51,306
The water!

801
01:01:51,513 --> 01:01:53,499
It's turning into light!

802
01:01:57,048 --> 01:01:58,021
What's going on?

803
01:01:58,666 --> 01:02:00,207
What is all of this?

804
01:02:00,557 --> 01:02:01,564
Eosmon.

805
01:02:21,308 --> 01:02:22,722
We're surrounded!

806
01:02:23,317 --> 01:02:25,097
There's so many of them.

807
01:02:25,312 --> 01:02:26,454
Not good!

808
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:29,236
Insane.

809
01:02:30,223 --> 01:02:35,465
This is my Digimon. I created
her to save the other DigiDestined.

810
01:02:35,854 --> 01:02:37,308
She is a goddess.

811
01:02:37,864 --> 01:02:40,176
No! She's not even a real Digimon!

812
01:02:40,564 --> 01:02:43,392
When you were a kid you had a real Digimon partner!

813
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:46,730
That's right. And she was the best friend I ever had.

814
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:50,464
I've been trying to get her back ever since she vanished.

815
01:02:50,845 --> 01:02:55,372
For years... and years... I've been very patient...

816
01:02:55,891 --> 01:03:00,563
But no matter what I did, I couldn't
spark life back into her digital data.

817
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:05,268
Then one day...

818
01:03:09,429 --> 01:03:11,567
...the day that the aurora appeared...

819
01:03:13,171 --> 01:03:15,961
Life sparked into that lifeless digital data.

820
01:03:18,788 --> 01:03:23,023
And the Eosmon that appeared... had a special ability.

821
01:03:24,459 --> 01:03:27,885
It could digitize a Digidestined consciousness.

822
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:28,869
Exactly

823
01:03:29,497 --> 01:03:32,143
When I realized that, I heard a voice in my head.

824
01:03:32,812 --> 01:03:36,983
It said use this power... use
it to save the other DigiDestined.

825
01:03:37,959 --> 01:03:40,017
It was Morphomon speaking to me.

826
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:46,270
That's why... I have to save her. And the
other DigiDestined throughout the entire world.

827
01:03:46,819 --> 01:03:48,598
Throughout the entire world?

828
01:03:48,656 --> 01:03:50,040
It's Izzy's list.

829
01:03:51,026 --> 01:03:55,585
Every name and location... of
every known DigiDestined in the world.

830
01:03:56,196 --> 01:03:58,612
Menoa, don't. Don't do it!

831
01:03:58,771 --> 01:04:01,313
I'm going to bring them all to the Never World.

832
01:04:01,837 --> 01:04:03,664
What you're doing is wrong!

833
01:04:03,767 --> 01:04:09,914
They will be here forever... With their
best friends... and their fondest memories.

834
01:04:09,939 --> 01:04:11,306
Stop her!

835
01:04:13,545 --> 01:04:14,506
What's that?

836
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,187
Tentomon? What are you doing?

837
01:04:19,327 --> 01:04:20,402
Greymon!

838
01:04:21,419 --> 01:04:25,764
Huh? Patamon? They're attacking us?

839
01:04:28,767 --> 01:04:32,344
Gatomon? Gomamon? Palmon?

840
01:04:32,384 --> 01:04:33,798
Why are they doing that?

841
01:04:34,038 --> 01:04:36,318
I think... they're being controlled!

842
01:04:36,343 --> 01:04:36,723
No.

843
01:04:38,672 --> 01:04:40,606
It's of their own free will.

844
01:04:42,976 --> 01:04:44,387
This is their dream.

845
01:04:46,236 --> 01:04:47,723
This is their desire.

846
01:04:49,576 --> 01:04:51,364
This is where they belong.

847
01:04:52,292 --> 01:04:56,830
And by trying to destroy it, you've become... the enemy.

848
01:05:00,531 --> 01:05:04,202
This proves... that I was right from the very beginning.

849
01:05:05,329 --> 01:05:08,199
But...  Does this mean...?

850
01:05:11,318 --> 01:05:13,277
And now I save myself.

851
01:05:35,627 --> 01:05:39,844
Now I can save all of the DigiDestined
that haven't lost their partners yet.

852
01:05:41,368 --> 01:05:44,063
And there's nothing you can do to stop me.

853
01:06:23,224 --> 01:06:25,360
Wow, nice one, ExVeemon!

854
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:27,346
You all right?

855
01:06:27,473 --> 01:06:27,957
Yeah.

856
01:06:28,123 --> 01:06:29,214
You should run...

857
01:06:30,138 --> 01:06:31,104
What's that?

858
01:06:33,616 --> 01:06:36,857
I told you it was bad idea to
connect your pad to the internet!

859
01:06:36,882 --> 01:06:38,374
Hey, I have no choice!

860
01:06:38,438 --> 01:06:42,765
When you're trying to save all the DigiDestined
around the world... you need to have a browser!

861
01:06:42,801 --> 01:06:45,564
So all these Eosmon are after us, huh?

862
01:06:45,652 --> 01:06:47,370
Spiking Strike!

863
01:06:48,177 --> 01:06:50,083
Megaton Press!

864
01:06:50,282 --> 01:06:53,486
I'm telling you, I think
something's happened to Matt and Tai.

865
01:06:53,511 --> 01:06:55,424
Hey, Yolei! Are you all right?

866
01:06:55,524 --> 01:06:56,718
Yeah, I'm okay!

867
01:07:00,198 --> 01:07:02,785
Looks like we're gonna have to deal with this ourselves!

868
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:04,989
All right, guys. Everybody ready to go?!

869
01:07:05,052 --> 01:07:05,600
Yeah!

870
01:07:11,037 --> 01:07:13,014
We should be safe for a while here.

871
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:14,086
I guess so.

872
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:15,379
Huh?

873
01:07:16,498 --> 01:07:17,660
What do we do now?

874
01:07:19,455 --> 01:07:21,457
Maybe we were never good enough to win.

875
01:07:30,610 --> 01:07:32,334
You're not alone, Tai.

876
01:07:33,861 --> 01:07:35,297
We should fight.

877
01:07:37,212 --> 01:07:39,468
Tai, let's go! We can do it.

878
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:41,890
We still have the power to defeat it.

879
01:07:42,289 --> 01:07:44,560
But then, it'll all be over.

880
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,198
Do you understand what it means to keep fighting?

881
01:07:47,285 --> 01:07:49,288
Of course, I do, what am I, an idiot?

882
01:07:49,371 --> 01:07:52,141
But it's the only way that we can save everyone!

883
01:07:54,348 --> 01:07:59,744
Besides, it makes us so happy to see how
you guys grew up to be so big and strong.

884
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:03,653
It's so exciting to see the changes
you've gone through in your lives.

885
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:07,490
You guys...

886
01:08:08,822 --> 01:08:13,250
Besides... I have the feeling that
we're gonna see each other again one day!

887
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:19,877
So, come on, Tai, let's go.

888
01:08:19,986 --> 01:08:21,837
Yeah, let's go, Matt!

889
01:08:26,059 --> 01:08:26,701
Okay.

890
01:08:27,877 --> 01:08:30,340
Let's go, Gabumon! Let's save them!

891
01:08:30,404 --> 01:08:32,691
Let's show them the strength of our bond!

892
01:08:34,089 --> 01:08:35,845
One last adventure!

893
01:08:36,385 --> 01:08:36,998
Mhm!

894
01:08:55,812 --> 01:08:59,299
Okay, guys! Time to go back where you belong!

895
01:08:59,999 --> 01:09:03,009
More DigiDestined are on their way to join us here.

896
01:09:03,299 --> 01:09:05,321
Lots of them from around the world!

897
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:08,468
This place will become even more fun than ever!

898
01:09:08,849 --> 01:09:11,018
The smiles are never going to end!

899
01:09:12,409 --> 01:09:18,467
You can all stay right here with
your best friend... together forever.

900
01:09:20,228 --> 01:09:23,677
Let's stay here together... forever and ever.

901
01:09:34,755 --> 01:09:36,677
I'm surprised you came on your own.

902
01:09:38,402 --> 01:09:39,983
Did you change your minds?

903
01:09:40,248 --> 01:09:41,644
You know that we didn't.

904
01:09:41,669 --> 01:09:43,209
We rather save everyone.

905
01:09:45,812 --> 01:09:47,188
That's nonsense.

906
01:09:47,872 --> 01:09:51,742
This is our world. Our perfect world!

907
01:09:57,422 --> 01:09:58,987
You ready, Agumon?!

908
01:10:00,106 --> 01:10:01,322
Ready, Gabumon?

909
01:10:01,347 --> 01:10:01,917
Yeah!

910
01:10:13,757 --> 01:10:16,678
Attack!

911
01:10:30,425 --> 01:10:33,611
Just leave. Just leave us be.

912
01:10:33,907 --> 01:10:36,653
Your perfect world is nothing but a big lie!

913
01:10:39,992 --> 01:10:42,875
Please, stop. Why are you destroying it?

914
01:10:42,908 --> 01:10:46,410
All this place does is freeze people in their childhoods!

915
01:10:50,707 --> 01:10:53,981
That's not true. I've saved them all from heartbreak!

916
01:10:57,087 --> 01:11:01,933
As long as they're here... they won't
suffer that same sense of loss that I had!

917
01:11:02,147 --> 01:11:07,851
Like having part of yourself... torn away!

918
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:22,263
This is unbearable.

919
01:11:25,958 --> 01:11:29,590
To lose something... something so important...

920
01:11:30,605 --> 01:11:33,633
I can't... I can't bear it...!

921
01:11:37,342 --> 01:11:38,463
What's happening?

922
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:44,056
What is this?

923
01:11:53,296 --> 01:11:56,291
Only I know how it feels to suffer like this!

924
01:11:59,368 --> 01:12:05,660
I will save everyone... because...
I'm going to become their goddess!

925
01:12:26,149 --> 01:12:27,508
I don't believe it...

926
01:12:28,193 --> 01:12:30,568
She digivolved... No!

927
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:33,071
She was absorbed...!

928
01:12:33,773 --> 01:12:34,579
Menoa...

929
01:12:37,607 --> 01:12:38,877
Tai, Matt!

930
01:12:56,033 --> 01:12:56,779
Matt...!

931
01:12:58,041 --> 01:13:00,719
I'm alright! Where's Omnimon?

932
01:13:38,783 --> 01:13:40,059
Omnimon!

933
01:13:44,575 --> 01:13:46,601
Now, ExVeemon, go!

934
01:13:46,853 --> 01:13:48,974
Ex-Laser!

935
01:13:50,437 --> 01:13:51,971
Blast Rings!

936
01:13:53,525 --> 01:13:55,601
Nice one, Aquilamon!

937
01:13:55,775 --> 01:13:57,910
Unfortunately, we're still way out numbered!

938
01:13:57,935 --> 01:14:00,368
I smack 'em down, but they keep coming!

939
01:14:00,709 --> 01:14:03,618
I know, but we still owe it to the others not to give up!

940
01:14:03,673 --> 01:14:04,832
I agree with Ken!

941
01:14:05,234 --> 01:14:07,017
Who said anything about giving up?!

942
01:14:07,297 --> 01:14:10,466
I mean, it's not like we're the
only one's fighting around the world!

943
01:14:30,539 --> 01:14:31,894
Omnimon!

944
01:14:37,903 --> 01:14:40,506
This isn't over yet.

945
01:15:04,905 --> 01:15:05,921
Agumon!

946
01:15:07,754 --> 01:15:08,475
Kari...?

947
01:15:10,944 --> 01:15:11,508
Izzy?

948
01:15:12,709 --> 01:15:14,034
Let go, T.K.!

949
01:15:14,225 --> 01:15:19,137
Let me go, Kari! You, too, Izzy!
We've gotta save Agumon and Gabumon!

950
01:15:19,162 --> 01:15:22,998
T.K., let me go! I need to do this to save you!

951
01:15:23,041 --> 01:15:28,559
I know you understand me, Kari! Escaping into
your old memories is no way to live, believe me!

952
01:15:28,584 --> 01:15:31,617
We can't stay kids forever, we have to grow up...

953
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:34,588
You okay, Matt...

954
01:15:42,996 --> 01:15:43,980
But, why?

955
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:39,944
You have to... grow... up!

956
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:44,830
We all have to... grow up... one day!

957
01:16:49,349 --> 01:16:51,186
Into the future!

958
01:17:04,190 --> 01:17:05,547
That's Tai...

959
01:17:06,765 --> 01:17:08,035
Where's Matt?

960
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:10,823
Tai...

961
01:17:26,001 --> 01:17:26,794
Big brother?

962
01:17:31,712 --> 01:17:34,573
Kari... you're all here!

963
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:35,765
We are here.

964
01:17:35,858 --> 01:17:37,743
I used to hate that damn whistle.

965
01:17:37,997 --> 01:17:40,063
Wait, Tai, where's Eosmon?

966
01:17:49,756 --> 01:17:52,720
Let's go, Gomamon! I don't like being turned into a kid!

967
01:17:53,522 --> 01:17:54,793
Way ahead of you, Joe!

968
01:17:55,412 --> 01:17:57,366
Palmon, let's join this fight!

969
01:17:57,548 --> 01:18:01,013
Yeah! Eosmon is in for some prickly pain!

970
01:18:01,294 --> 01:18:02,302
Ready, Patamon?

971
01:18:03,406 --> 01:18:04,781
The big kids need some help!

972
01:18:04,806 --> 01:18:06,663
There's no bigger kid than me!

973
01:18:06,812 --> 01:18:08,521
What do you say, Gatomon?

974
01:18:08,885 --> 01:18:10,619
Just one thing... Meow.

975
01:18:10,974 --> 01:18:13,742
So that's Eosmon's top digivolved form.

976
01:18:13,767 --> 01:18:17,571
We can only hope! I'd hate to think
there's another level bigger than this one!

977
01:18:17,596 --> 01:18:20,257
You said it. Get ready Tentomon?

978
01:18:20,601 --> 01:18:21,606
I believe...

979
01:18:22,809 --> 01:18:24,387
I believe in you all!

980
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,676
Harpoon Torpedo!

981
01:18:33,738 --> 01:18:35,494
Needle Spray!

982
01:18:39,245 --> 01:18:42,771
Tai...Matt...

983
01:18:48,461 --> 01:18:52,131
Agumon, I want to save them as bad as you.

984
01:18:55,692 --> 01:18:57,876
I know exactly how you feel, Tai.

985
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:04,311
Gabumon... I want to fight alongside
you... even if it's our last battle.

986
01:19:07,162 --> 01:19:08,910
Well let's get to it then, Matt.

987
01:19:10,346 --> 01:19:14,106
This is going to be our... final digivolution!

988
01:19:39,763 --> 01:19:41,493
Where's that light coming from?

989
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:42,890
Pretty...

990
01:20:13,369 --> 01:20:15,578
It's a new... Digivolution!

991
01:20:15,681 --> 01:20:17,451
I don't believe my eyes!

992
01:20:17,803 --> 01:20:18,945
Neither do I...

993
01:20:19,870 --> 01:20:22,807
That is prodigious.

994
01:21:17,779 --> 01:21:18,876
I need you, Matt!

995
01:21:18,901 --> 01:21:19,812
I'm with you!

996
01:21:46,117 --> 01:21:50,671
Oh, Morphomon! We'll be together
forever! Morphomon, everyone's avoiding me.

997
01:21:50,845 --> 01:21:54,287
I can't wait to grow up so people
will stop treating me like a weirdo.

998
01:21:55,127 --> 01:21:56,430
What are we seeing?

999
01:21:56,612 --> 01:21:58,384
They're Menoa's memories.

1000
01:21:58,566 --> 01:22:02,459
I'll make a life for myself! I'm gonna be fine on my own!

1001
01:22:02,773 --> 01:22:03,622
Morphomon

1002
01:22:03,705 --> 01:22:05,914
I can hear the pain in her voice.

1003
01:22:06,321 --> 01:22:08,227
It's a cry for help.

1004
01:22:08,853 --> 01:22:11,969
She's been crying on the inside.

1005
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:15,276
Morphomon... Morphomon!

1006
01:22:16,062 --> 01:22:21,869
Morphomon! Guess what! They told me in school
that I skipped enough grades to start college!

1007
01:22:21,901 --> 01:22:24,404
It's time for me to live my own life for once!

1008
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:27,669
I'm going to help the world by
conducting the research I love!

1009
01:22:29,231 --> 01:22:30,520
Morphomon...?

1010
01:22:36,535 --> 01:22:41,199
Morphomon! What's wrong? Why are you glowing like that?

1011
01:22:42,715 --> 01:22:43,661
Morphomon...!

1012
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:48,220
Morphomon... Morphomon...!

1013
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:55,101
Morphomon...

1014
01:22:57,719 --> 01:23:00,439
I... I...

1015
01:23:03,436 --> 01:23:07,774
I made this choice... I chose to grow up!

1016
01:23:09,633 --> 01:23:13,557
Did I... did I make the wrong choice?

1017
01:23:18,157 --> 01:23:22,520
I just don't know. Nothing makes sense.

1018
01:23:24,027 --> 01:23:31,792
Somebody... please... somebody help me!

1019
01:23:37,116 --> 01:23:39,450
Menoa! We're here to help you!

1020
01:23:39,791 --> 01:23:41,674
You didn't make the wrong choice!

1021
01:23:42,031 --> 01:23:45,520
That's right. Even if you made a bad choice along the way.

1022
01:23:46,590 --> 01:23:50,573
We all live with the choices we
make. It's what makes us human!

1023
01:23:51,105 --> 01:23:56,309
We may not be able to change our fate... but who cares!?

1024
01:23:56,357 --> 01:23:58,462
Our lives aren't preordained!

1025
01:24:06,359 --> 01:24:09,561
That's why we'll never give up fighting the good fight!

1026
01:24:28,463 --> 01:24:31,195
We'll always be together...

1027
01:24:40,296 --> 01:24:41,707
Please forgive me.

1028
01:24:56,935 --> 01:24:57,747
Whoa...

1029
01:25:03,752 --> 01:25:05,070
Is it all over?

1030
01:25:05,683 --> 01:25:07,088
Boy, I hope so.

1031
01:25:07,756 --> 01:25:08,748
Seems like it

1032
01:25:08,983 --> 01:25:10,687
Yes, I have to concur.

1033
01:25:10,712 --> 01:25:12,253
Ah, thank goodness!

1034
01:25:12,278 --> 01:25:14,573
Those older guys know what they're doing!

1035
01:25:14,748 --> 01:25:16,154
Yeah, they must have won.

1036
01:25:16,328 --> 01:25:17,408
I reckon!

1037
01:25:42,611 --> 01:25:43,717
Where am I...?

1038
01:25:43,742 --> 01:25:45,948
I can't see without your glasses.

1039
01:25:55,189 --> 01:25:59,485
Oh, Mimi! I had the strangest dream last night.

1040
01:26:01,787 --> 01:26:04,110
Another beautiful day!

1041
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:22,893
It's so hot.

1042
01:26:23,292 --> 01:26:24,387
Well, it is summer.

1043
01:26:25,268 --> 01:26:28,923
Tai, do you remember the first time we met?

1044
01:26:30,154 --> 01:26:31,401
How could I forget?

1045
01:26:34,269 --> 01:26:37,463
Wow! What an amazing view!

1046
01:26:37,795 --> 01:26:39,314
I like coming up here...

1047
01:26:43,898 --> 01:26:45,790
You still have that harmonica, huh?

1048
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:47,682
It's actually a new one!

1049
01:26:48,258 --> 01:26:50,415
I suddenly felt like playing again.

1050
01:26:52,668 --> 01:26:54,292
Well then, let's hear something.

1051
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:57,779
Hey, Tai...

1052
01:26:58,885 --> 01:26:59,647
What is it?

1053
01:27:00,083 --> 01:27:02,237
I want you to buy me some shaved ice.

1054
01:27:02,262 --> 01:27:04,660
Huh? You're such a handful!

1055
01:27:06,621 --> 01:27:08,719
You're favorite is melon-flavored, right?

1056
01:27:14,474 --> 01:27:17,419
You know, Tai, you sure have gotten big.

1057
01:27:20,741 --> 01:27:22,450
And you never change.

1058
01:27:50,645 --> 01:27:54,348
In case you didn't know, you're
the best partner ever, Matt.

1059
01:28:01,576 --> 01:28:03,072
Hey, Tai...

1060
01:28:05,064 --> 01:28:06,598
Hey, Matt...

1061
01:28:08,203 --> 01:28:09,544
What will you do...?

1062
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:11,293
...tomorrow?

1063
01:28:14,366 --> 01:28:18,794
That's a good question. I guess no one knows...

1064
01:28:19,070 --> 01:28:20,683
...what tomorrow may bring.

1065
01:28:30,354 --> 01:28:31,052
Whoa.

1066
01:28:31,572 --> 01:28:34,046
Anything can happen. Tomorrow...

1067
01:28:34,173 --> 01:28:34,856
We can...

1068
01:29:34,279 --> 01:29:36,892
And that was how we finally grew up.

1069
01:29:37,585 --> 01:29:39,483
But... our story hasn't ended yet.

1070
01:29:39,946 --> 01:29:42,802
It's just "digivolving" in a new direction.

1071
01:30:33,836 --> 01:30:37,409
But I can promise you this... I will see you again!
