them growing here.

Tomorrow we can make
stew for everyone.

Yeah!
I'll get the pheasant ready!

[Princess]
Sorry I'm late.

00:30:51.911 --> 00:30:53.579 position:13% line:89% align:start
Sutemaru caught a pheasant.

00:30:53.613 --> 00:30:55.448 position:10% line:89% align:start
And we found some mushrooms!

Oh, and mountain grapes!

Where are you going?

00:31:03.422 --> 00:31:04.557 position:33% line:89% align:start
The capital.

The capital?

00:31:06.927 --> 00:31:08.328 position:38% line:89% align:start
Me, too?

00:31:09.396 --> 00:31:10.330 position:35% line:89% align:start
Right now?

00:31:10.364 --> 00:31:13.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yes. Just leave the
basket on the ground.

What? But... we're making
pheasant stew tomorrow,

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:17.739 position:13% line:89% align:start
I promised Sutemaru that--

00:31:17.772 --> 00:31:19.272 position:27% line:89% align:start
Just put it down.

00:31:25.313 --> 00:31:27.548 position:27% line:89% align:start

Well, of course.

00:35:22.999 --> 00:35:26.136 position:16% line:83% align:start

00:36:15.188 --> 00:36:15.789 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:19.826 position:19% line:83% align:start
You most certainly will
not swim in there.

Ah!

00:36:23.196 --> 00:36:24.931 position:27% line:83% align:start
A noble princess
would never frolic.

00:36:24.965 --> 00:36:28.135 position:13% line:83% align:start
Nor even consider partaking
in such unlady-like antics.

00:36:29.303 --> 00:36:30.871 position:27% line:89% align:start
Your Highness...

00:36:30.905 --> 00:36:33.574 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've have thusly summoned
Lady Sagami here

00:36:33.607 --> 00:36:35.009 position:30% line:83% align:start
from the palace
to educate you

00:36:35.042 --> 00:36:36.243 position:16% line:89% align:start
in the ways of nobility.

00:36:37.578 --> 00:36:40.014 position:19% line:83% align:start
Her job is to make you
a noble princess.

00:36:40.047 --> 00:36:42.150 position:30% line:89% align:start
Noble princess?

00:36:43.051 --> 00:36:44.518 position:27% line:89% align:start
From the palace?

00:36:46.822 --> 00:36:50.292 position:7% line:83% align:start
My Lord, this child is clearly
in desperate need

00:36:50.325 --> 00:36:51.693 position:24% line:89% align:start
of my instruction.

00:36:52.828 --> 00:36:55.163 position:10% line:83% align:start
Naturally, I would have liked
to have started earlier,

00:36:55.198 --> 00:36:58.800 position:10% line:83% align:start
but I, Sagami, will mold her
into a truly fine young lady.

 <i>and graces of a noble lady.</i>

00:37:09.178 --> 00:37:10.913 position:21% line:89% align:start
Watch this carefully.

00:37:10.947 --> 00:37:13.616 position:19% line:83% align:start
Keep your back like so,
as straight as an arrow.

00:37:13.649 --> 00:37:16.220 position:7% line:89% align:start
Swish up perfectly, like this.

00:37:17.921 --> 00:37:19.223 position:41% line:89% align:start
Swish?

00:37:19.256 --> 00:37:20.257 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:37:21.258 --> 00:37:23.761 position:7% line:89% align:start
That is approximately correct.

00:37:23.794 --> 00:37:27.898 position:7% line:83% align:start
The truth is, a noble princess
stands only on rare occasions.

00:37:29.234 --> 00:37:32.137 position:10% line:83% align:start
But, how do I move if I want
to pick up something?

00:37:32.703 --> 00:37:34.005 position:33% line:89% align:start
Like this...

00:37:34.039 --> 00:37:36.608 position:10% line:83% align:start
come to a kneeling position,
and shuffle your knees

00:37:36.641 --> 00:37:38.910 position:24% line:89% align:start
to move gracefully.

00:37:42.214 --> 00:37:43.982 position:13% line:89% align:start
Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.

00:37:44.015 --> 00:37:45.750 position:13% line:89% align:start
Notice nothing else moves.

00:37:48.154 --> 00:37:51.690 position:30% line:83% align:start
Your Highness!
We are far from done!

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.095 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow.

00:37:57.163 --> 00:37:58.697 position:16% line:83% align:start
It is a beautiful scroll,
is it not?

00:37:59.932 --> 00:38:02.135 position:16% line:83% align:start
The proper way of looking
at it is like this,

00:38:02.169 --> 00:38:04.171 position:24% line:89% align:start
so the story flows.

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.108 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:39:12.276 --> 00:39:15.079 position:10% line:89% align:start

You've become so
elegant that I--

00:39:22.854 --> 00:39:24.022 position:19% line:89% align:start
I hardly recognize you!

00:39:25.824 --> 00:39:27.159 position:13% line:89% align:start
How about the koto lessons?

00:39:27.192 --> 00:39:28.827 position:7% line:89% align:start
Are they coming along as well?

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:32.964 position:19% line:83% align:start

My! How beautiful!

00:39:55.355 --> 00:39:57.958 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's very suspicious,
and I'm starting to wonder

00:39:57.991 --> 00:40:00.260 position:24% line:83% align:start
if someone else has
trained her before.

00:40:00.294 --> 00:40:02.263 position:27% line:83% align:start
In front of you,
she performs perfectly

00:40:02.297 --> 00:40:04.199 position:10% line:89% align:start
but with me, she's all games.

00:40:04.232 --> 00:40:05.832 position:30% line:89% align:start
So I was right.

00:40:06.434 --> 00:40:07.902 position:16% line:89% align:start
Your Highness is a being

who's come straight
down from Heaven.

00:40:09.504 --> 00:40:11.105 position:19% line:83% align:start
She was never supposed
to stay in the mountains

00:40:11.139 --> 00:40:13.208 position:30% line:83% align:start

00:51:05.568 --> 00:51:08.537 position:7% line:83% align:start
Come on you know what we mean!
Princess Kaguya or whoever...

00:51:08.571 --> 00:51:11.909 position:7% line:83% align:start
her flower of a face enshrined
behind that blind.

00:51:11.942 --> 00:51:14.978 position:10% line:83% align:start
Surely there wouldn't be any
harm in allowing us to see her,

00:51:15.012 --> 00:51:16.647 position:35% line:83% align:start
if she's as

Her Highest is a princess!

Better wood?

00:55:01.052 --> 00:55:03.388 position:19% line:83% align:start
They probably won't be
back for ten years.

00:55:04.022 --> 00:55:05.090 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ten years?

00:55:05.123 --> 00:55:07.726 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you use up all the trees,
the mountain's ruined.

00:55:08.894 --> 00:55:11.062 position:21% line:83% align:start
But if you leave the

00:55:11.096 --> 00:55:14.233 position:21% line:83% align:start
and go on a journey,
it comes back to life.

00:55:15.134 --> 00:55:17.103 position:10% line:89% align:start
Trees need a good ten years,

00:55:17.136 --> 00:55:18.838 position:10% line:89% align:start
then you can work them again.

00:55:20.006 --> 00:55:22.175 position:24% line:83% align:start

looks dead already.

00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:48.336 position:21% line:83% align:start

getting ready for spring.

00:55:50.438 --> 00:55:51.439 position:30% line:89% align:start

00:55:52.373 --> 00:55:54.209 position:7% line:89% align:start

I swear I will win this race!

I must get to her first!

That glimmering beauty
will be mine, I tell you!

Nothing will stop me!

01:03:37.668 --> 01:03:40.271 position:21% line:83% align:start
The one who will win
her is me! I swear it!

01:03:40.304 --> 01:03:42.239 position:21% line:89% align:start
She will be my wife!

01:03:51.951 --> 01:03:54.887 position:33% line:83% align:start
Lady Sagami!
You have to see these!

01:03:55.654 --> 01:03:56.488 position:21% line:89% align:start
What is it, my Lord?

01:03:56.521 --> 01:03:58.256 position:24% line:83% align:start
Just look at these!
Look at them all!

01:03:58.691 --> 01:04:00.460 position:13% line:83% align:start
Five of the most high-born
men in the land

01:04:00.493 --> 01:04:01.961 position:21% line:83% align:start
have come calling for
one simple reason!

01:04:01.994 --> 01:04:03.663 position:5% line:89% align:start
They want to marry the Princess!

01:04:04.997 --> 01:04:06.033 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh, my!

01:04:06.066 --> 01:04:07.968 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, wonderful! Wonderful!

01:04:08.001 --> 01:04:09.769 position:21% line:83% align:start
All these princes are
interested in her.

01:04:09.803 --> 01:04:10.971 position:21% line:83% align:start
And even the Minister
of the Right!

01:04:11.872 --> 01:04:13.506 position:5% line:89% align:start
But how do we choose among them?

01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:14.808 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's going to be a very
difficult challenge.

01:04:16.043 --> 01:04:18.479 position:13% line:83% align:start
And to make matters worse,
they're all waiting impatiently

01:04:18.512 --> 01:04:19.847 position:27% line:83% align:start
in formal dress,
even as we speak.

01:04:20.481 --> 01:04:23.317 position:16% line:83% align:start
I will take care of this.
Leave Her Highness to me.

01:04:23.350 --> 01:04:25.385 position:19% line:83% align:start
You go entertain them,
and whatever you do,

01:04:25.419 --> 01:04:26.420 position:27% line:89% align:start
keep them happy!

01:04:26.453 --> 01:04:27.354 position:27% line:89% align:start
Alright, milady.

01:04:27.387 --> 01:04:30.290 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, and thank you,
thank you, thank you!

01:04:30.692 --> 01:04:31.960 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

01:04:31.993 --> 01:04:32.894 position:21% line:89% align:start
Wonderful! Wonderful!

01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:37.766 position:16% line:83% align:start
I just knew that banquet
was worth putting on!

01:04:39.334 --> 01:04:41.302 position:16% line:89% align:start
These are five proposals

01:04:41.336 --> 01:04:43.939 position:21% line:83% align:start
from five of the most
important nobles in the land.

01:04:45.708 --> 01:04:48.377 position:16% line:83% align:start
Whichever one you choose,
you cannot go wrong.

01:04:49.111 --> 01:04:50.780 position:10% line:89% align:start
But I've never even met them.

01:04:50.813 --> 01:04:52.782 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, please don't worry.

01:04:52.815 --> 01:04:54.951 position:21% line:83% align:start
This is very simple,
you will pick a proposal

01:04:54.985 --> 01:04:56.652 position:27% line:83% align:start
from one of these
noble gentlemen

01:04:56.685 --> 01:04:58.688 position:16% line:83% align:start
and then you'll meet him
on your wedding day.

01:04:59.555 --> 01:05:00.724 position:13% line:89% align:start
It hardly matters, because

01:05:00.757 --> 01:05:02.826 position:27% line:83% align:start
with any of these
fine, princely men

01:05:02.859 --> 01:05:06.296 position:27% line:83% align:start
you will be happy
forever, and ever!

01:05:06.997 --> 01:05:08.698 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm supposed to feel happy?

01:05:11.035 --> 01:05:13.838 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have no intention of
marrying anyone yet.

01:05:13.871 --> 01:05:15.505 position:16% line:89% align:start
Have you lost your mind?

01:05:15.539 --> 01:05:16.874 position:21% line:83% align:start
Once you have become
a noble princess

01:05:17.141 --> 01:05:19.043 position:27% line:83% align:start
you must marry a
suitable gentleman

01:05:19.076 --> 01:05:20.511 position:19% line:89% align:start
as quickly as possible!

01:05:20.545 --> 01:05:22.413 position:13% line:83% align:start
That is the very definition
of happiness!

01:05:23.381 --> 01:05:25.117 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why would you even think twice?

01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:27.451 position:19% line:83% align:start
With any of those men,
your happiness would be

01:05:27.485 --> 01:05:29.387 position:19% line:89% align:start
completely guaranteed.

01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:31.389 position:16% line:89% align:start
I do not want any of it!

01:05:31.422 --> 01:05:33.492 position:30% line:83% align:start
So please tell
those men to leave.

01:05:36.061 --> 01:05:39.064 position:13% line:83% align:start
Do you really want to hurt
your father like this?

01:05:40.499 --> 01:05:43.069 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you understand that
he is as happy for you

01:05:43.102 --> 01:05:45.470 position:13% line:89% align:start
as he would be for himself!

01:05:47.974 --> 01:05:50.743 position:27% line:89% align:start
[birds chirping]

01:05:56.482 --> 01:05:57.952 position:24% line:83% align:start
Everything has been
made ready for you.

01:05:58.451 --> 01:06:01.487 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you would be so kind
to come this way...

01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:26.781 position:35% line:89% align:start
Now please,

01:06:26.815 --> 01:06:29.618 position:19% line:83% align:start
express your proposals
to the princess in order.

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:35.758 position:35% line:89% align:start
Princess...

01:06:37.093 --> 01:06:40.863 position:10% line:83% align:start
as you know my true feelings
have been clearly stated

01:06:40.897 --> 01:06:43.466 position:19% line:83% align:start
in the letter that has
been given to you.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:47.536 position:30% line:83% align:start
Your Highness,
Princess Kaguya,

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:51.742 position:21% line:83% align:start
if I was so fortunate
that you became my wife

01:06:51.775 --> 01:06:53.110 position:30% line:89% align:start
it would be...

01:06:53.143 --> 01:06:55.879 position:16% line:83% align:start
as if I plucked a branch
of the tree of jewels

01:06:55.913 --> 01:06:57.848 position:27% line:83% align:start
that grows on the
mountain of Horai,

01:06:57.881 --> 01:06:58.815 position:19% line:89% align:start
whose trunk is of gold

01:06:58.849 --> 01:07:00.985 position:21% line:83% align:start
and whose fruits are
the whitest of pearls.

01:07:01.652 --> 01:07:03.187 position:27% line:89% align:start
Princess Kaguya,

01:07:03.221 --> 01:07:05.623 position:10% line:89% align:start
you are an exquisite treasure

01:07:05.657 --> 01:07:08.092 position:16% line:83% align:start
that is as unattainable,
precious as that--

01:07:08.126 --> 01:07:09.827 position:16% line:89% align:start
I am Prince Ishitsukuri.

01:07:09.861 --> 01:07:12.063 position:19% line:83% align:start
Princess Kaguya, if you
consent to be my wife,

01:07:12.096 --> 01:07:14.532 position:24% line:83% align:start
I will worship you
morning and night

01:07:14.565 --> 01:07:16.035 position:13% line:83% align:start
my forehead pressed to the
ground in utter devotion.

01:07:17.069 --> 01:07:18.737 position:24% line:83% align:start
You are a treasure
I would revere

01:07:18.771 --> 01:07:21.807 position:10% line:83% align:start
as much as the stone begging
bowl of Lord Buddha himself.

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:24.109 position:21% line:83% align:start
You would worship her
as if she were some kind of

01:07:24.143 --> 01:07:24.710 position:27% line:89% align:start
cold stone bowl?

01:07:26.145 --> 01:07:30.183 position:7% line:83% align:start
Princess Kaguya, to me you are
as a robe of fire-rat fur.

01:07:30.216 --> 01:07:31.918 position:35% line:83% align:start
From which,
when thrown in the fire

01:07:31.952 --> 01:07:33.753 position:13% line:89% align:start
all impurity is burned away

01:07:33.787 --> 01:07:35.989 position:27% line:83% align:start
but which itself
is not consumed,

01:07:36.022 --> 01:07:37.791 position:13% line:89% align:start
only shining more brightly

01:07:37.824 --> 01:07:38.792 position:13% line:89% align:start
as the flames grow higher.

01:07:38.825 --> 01:07:42.128 position:21% line:83% align:start
You are utterly rare,
untouched and innocent

01:07:42.162 --> 01:07:43.997 position:24% line:83% align:start
as elusive as this
treasure about which

01:07:44.030 --> 01:07:45.832 position:7% line:89% align:start
they speak of finding in China.

01:07:45.865 --> 01:07:48.601 position:21% line:83% align:start
You have the gall to
compare Princess Kaguya

01:07:48.635 --> 01:07:49.804 position:30% line:89% align:start
to a rat-skin?!

01:07:49.837 --> 01:07:52.239 position:5% line:89% align:start
Princess to me, Counselor Otomo,

01:07:52.273 --> 01:07:54.675 position:30% line:83% align:start
you are a fine,
glistening jewel,

01:07:54.709 --> 01:07:56.143 position:24% line:83% align:start
a jewel that shines
intensely from above.

01:07:56.944 --> 01:07:58.746 position:16% line:89% align:start
A gem with more radiance

01:07:58.779 --> 01:08:00.781 position:21% line:83% align:start
than the five-colored
jewel that shines

01:08:00.815 --> 01:08:02.084 position:21% line:89% align:start
on the dragon's neck.

01:08:02.117 --> 01:08:03.151 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh no, no, no!

01:08:03.185 --> 01:08:04.585 position:19% line:89% align:start
For me, Princess Kaguya

01:08:04.618 --> 01:08:06.822 position:27% line:83% align:start
is something more
precious and natural

01:08:06.855 --> 01:08:08.957 position:5% line:89% align:start
like the warm cowry shell amulet

01:08:08.991 --> 01:08:10.258 position:21% line:89% align:start
swallows use a charm

01:08:10.959 --> 01:08:12.661 position:27% line:89% align:start
for a safe birth.

01:08:12.694 --> 01:08:14.696 position:16% line:89% align:start
That is a true treasure.

01:08:15.331 --> 01:08:16.832 position:24% line:89% align:start
A true treasure...

01:08:16.865 --> 01:08:19.268 position:10% line:83% align:start
You think a boring, everyday
seashell is a treasure?!

01:08:20.003 --> 01:08:21.636 position:24% line:89% align:start
You must be crazy!

01:08:21.670 --> 01:08:24.907 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, well... a dragon's neck
stinks you know!

01:08:24.941 --> 01:08:26.309 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's on the neck!

01:08:54.172 --> 01:08:58.176 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Princess] Gentlemen, I am most
grateful for these sentiments

01:08:58.209 --> 01:08:59.277 position:19% line:89% align:start
you express to someone

01:08:59.311 --> 01:09:00.745 position:13% line:89% align:start
you have never seen or met.

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:04.883 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yet, there is something
else I require.

01:09:06.886 --> 01:09:09.587 position:10% line:83% align:start
These rare treasures that are
difficult to obtain,

01:09:10.322 --> 01:09:13.159 position:5% line:89% align:start

Huh?

Then, and only then,
will I be able

using them as comparisons!

Yes.

Therefore...

me the real treasure,

The truth is she's asking
us to achieve

01:10:35.447 --> 01:10:36.080 position:24% line:89% align:start
an impossible task!

01:10:37.215 --> 01:10:39.251 position:10% line:89% align:start
Impossible! It can't be done.

01:10:39.284 --> 01:10:42.254 position:13% line:83% align:start

01:20:24.807 --> 01:20:26.041 position:27% line:83% align:start
you must prepare
yourself quickly

01:20:26.075 --> 01:20:27.543 position:10% line:89% align:start
to be married to the Prince.

01:20:27.576 --> 01:20:28.944 position:16% line:89% align:start
My heavens! I have to go!

01:20:28.978 --> 01:20:30.379 position:13% line:89% align:start
I must prepare a bedchamber

01:20:30.412 --> 01:20:32.481 position:30% line:83% align:start
for the Prince
and Your Highness.

01:20:32.815 --> 01:20:33.449 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yow!

01:20:34.583 --> 01:20:36.953 position:7% line:89% align:start
If only Lady Sagami were here!

01:20:39.856 --> 01:20:41.591 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Princess]
I don't believe it.

01:20:42.392 --> 01:20:43.894 position:21% line:89% align:start
Prepare a bedchamber?

01:20:47.497 --> 01:20:48.298 position:19% line:89% align:start
Where is the princess?

01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:50.300 position:38% line:83% align:start
Quickly,
where is Princess Kaguya?

01:20:51.235 --> 01:20:53.805 position:13% line:83% align:start
Please wait, Your Highness!
Please wait!

01:20:56.541 --> 01:20:57.708 position:24% line:89% align:start
Ah, Mr. Miyatsuko!

01:20:58.643 --> 01:20:59.544 position:10% line:89% align:start
Please forgive my appearance.

01:21:00.845 --> 01:21:03.881 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was so anxious to get here,
I didn't have time

01:21:03.915 --> 01:21:05.884 position:7% line:89% align:start
to change my traveling clothes!

01:21:05.918 --> 01:21:07.652 position:10% line:83% align:start
Your Highness, your presence
is always welcome here.

01:21:08.586 --> 01:21:09.922 position:10% line:89% align:start
This is most truly wonderful.

01:21:10.421 --> 01:21:12.491 position:30% line:83% align:start
Please come in.
I'll show you the way.

01:21:15.093 --> 01:21:16.595 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Miyatsuko]
Splendid.

01:21:34.081 --> 01:21:38.484 position:13% line:83% align:start
Without further ado, I will
present the promised object.

01:21:46.093 --> 01:21:47.795 position:35% line:89% align:start
[jingling]

01:21:51.132 --> 01:21:51.899 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

01:21:52.499 --> 01:21:55.937 position:35% line:89% align:start
[jingling]

01:21:57.072 --> 01:21:58.773 position:7% line:89% align:start
What can I say, it's dazzling!

01:21:58.807 --> 01:22:00.809 position:16% line:83% align:start
It leaves me speechless,
it's so... what, uh...

01:22:00.842 --> 01:22:04.846 position:10% line:83% align:start
It is, as you requested, the
jeweled branch of Mount Horai.

01:22:06.048 --> 01:22:08.783 position:5% line:83% align:start
Princess Kaguya, can you see it?
Come closer.

01:22:09.852 --> 01:22:12.520 position:24% line:83% align:start
Here, I will bring
it closer to you.

01:22:13.455 --> 01:22:14.590 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Princess]
One moment please.

01:22:14.624 --> 01:22:15.491 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Kuramochi]
Oh!

01:22:16.492 --> 01:22:18.728 position:19% line:83% align:start
First, allow me to ask
you how you found it.

01:22:19.562 --> 01:22:21.164 position:16% line:89% align:start
It must be quite a story.

01:22:21.964 --> 01:22:24.134 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, it is quite a story!

01:22:27.004 --> 01:22:29.673 position:47% line:83% align:start
Oh!
[laughs]

01:22:41.652 --> 01:22:44.789 position:13% line:83% align:start
Three years ago, I vowed to
carry out Your Highness's wish.

01:22:45.723 --> 01:22:47.659 position:10% line:89% align:start
I then set my plan in motion.

01:22:47.692 --> 01:22:49.994 position:16% line:83% align:start
From the harbor at Naniwa
I set course for

01:22:50.028 --> 01:22:51.629 position:19% line:89% align:start
the mountain of Horai.

01:22:52.597 --> 01:22:54.934 position:7% line:89% align:start
We were tossed by fierce waves,

01:22:54.967 --> 01:22:56.969 position:27% line:83% align:start
we nearly starved
from lack of food,

01:22:57.002 --> 01:23:00.806 position:21% line:83% align:start
and after a grueling,
harrowing journey...

01:23:03.008 --> 01:23:04.109 position:41% line:89% align:start
Behold!

01:23:04.143 --> 01:23:06.212 position:19% line:89% align:start
What is that mountain?

01:23:06.246 --> 01:23:09.782 position:27% line:83% align:start
So forbidding yet
so very beautiful?

01:23:11.151 --> 01:23:11.784 position:33% line:89% align:start
What is this?

01:23:13.053 --> 01:23:16.690 position:19% line:83% align:start
It flows with water of
gold and precious gems!

01:23:17.023 --> 01:23:17.624 position:44% line:89% align:start
Look!

01:23:18.825 --> 01:23:22.095 position:21% line:83% align:start
A maiden scoops water
with a silver bowl!

01:23:22.963 --> 01:23:23.630 position:30% line:89% align:start
Dear Maiden...

01:23:24.931 --> 01:23:27.667 position:13% line:83% align:start
Please tell me what is the
name of that mountain?

01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:31.138 position:7% line:89% align:start
That is the mountain of Horai.

01:23:32.573 --> 01:23:36.177 position:19% line:83% align:start
And you are very brave
to have traveled so far.

01:23:38.213 --> 01:23:42.017 position:10% line:83% align:start
Ah! I had finally arrived at
the mountain of Horai.

01:23:43.285 --> 01:23:45.821 position:19% line:83% align:start
Without a second glance
at the lovely maiden,

01:23:46.655 --> 01:23:48.256 position:19% line:89% align:start
I climbed the mountain.

01:23:49.791 --> 01:23:53.662 position:19% line:83% align:start
Behold! Those precious,
exquisite trees!

01:23:53.695 --> 01:23:58.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
Silver branches, a trunk of
gold, and fruit of pearls!

01:23:58.301 --> 01:24:00.903 position:30% line:83% align:start
So beautiful it
takes my breath away!

01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:02.537 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:05.975 position:16% line:83% align:start
Are these not the jeweled
branches of Horai,

01:24:06.009 --> 01:24:09.145 position:10% line:83% align:start
the very thing that Princess
Kaguya said she wished?

01:24:10.646 --> 01:24:13.850 position:16% line:83% align:start
And thus, without haste,
I snapped off this branch

01:24:13.884 --> 01:24:15.618 position:19% line:89% align:start
to bring to your feet.

01:24:23.594 --> 01:24:26.231 position:24% line:83% align:start
One look is worth a
hundred stories.

01:24:26.264 --> 01:24:29.600 position:21% line:83% align:start
Please. Won't you see
for yourself, Your Highness?

01:24:36.174 --> 01:24:38.676 position:10% line:89% align:start
[woman screaming in distance]

01:24:38.710 --> 01:24:40.312 position:41% line:83% align:start
[guard]
Stop! You shall not pass!

01:24:40.346 --> 01:24:42.647 position:44% line:83% align:start
[man]
Move! Get out of our way!

01:24:43.382 --> 01:24:45.317 position:7% line:89% align:start
What is that? What's going on?

01:24:45.351 --> 01:24:48.187 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm sincerely sorry.
I'll go see.

01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:49.922 position:41% line:83% align:start
[guard]
You have no business here!

01:24:49.955 --> 01:24:51.190 position:44% line:83% align:start
[man]
I must get this to her.

01:24:51.223 --> 01:24:53.059 position:33% line:89% align:start
[men arguing]

01:24:53.092 --> 01:24:55.828 position:41% line:83% align:start
Let go!
She must read this letter!

01:24:55.861 --> 01:24:56.796 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's going on?

01:24:57.330 --> 01:24:58.532 position:21% line:89% align:start
Just pay us our fee!

01:24:58.564 --> 01:25:01.634 position:10% line:83% align:start
We're here to collect for the
jeweled branch that we made.

01:25:02.169 --> 01:25:03.203 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's that?

01:25:04.171 --> 01:25:05.338 position:21% line:89% align:start
The branch they made?

01:25:06.706 --> 01:25:08.942 position:19% line:89% align:start
I am Ayabe no Uchimaro,

01:25:08.975 --> 01:25:11.945 position:21% line:83% align:start
a craftsman belonging
to the Guild of Artisans.

01:25:13.381 --> 01:25:15.283 position:30% line:83% align:start
At the order of
Prince Kuramochi,

01:25:15.316 --> 01:25:17.385 position:21% line:83% align:start
we gathered together
precious gems,

01:25:17.418 --> 01:25:18.753 position:33% line:89% align:start
mounted them,

01:25:18.786 --> 01:25:20.688 position:21% line:83% align:start
and put them together
as if it came from

01:25:20.721 --> 01:25:22.090 position:7% line:89% align:start
a jeweled tree on Mount Horai.

01:25:22.690 --> 01:25:23.559 position:41% line:89% align:start
Really?

01:25:23.591 --> 01:25:25.793 position:24% line:83% align:start
However, the Prince
has made no effort

01:25:25.827 --> 01:25:27.229 position:13% line:89% align:start
to pay us what we are owed.

01:25:27.262 --> 01:25:28.263 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well that's an outrage!

01:25:29.331 --> 01:25:31.900 position:13% line:83% align:start
And since Princess Kaguya,
one of his concubines,

01:25:31.934 --> 01:25:34.269 position:16% line:89% align:start
sorry, one of his wives,

01:25:34.303 --> 01:25:36.939 position:21% line:83% align:start
was here, we decided
to take action.

01:25:36.972 --> 01:25:38.740 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ill-mannered as such
a move may be,

01:25:38.774 --> 01:25:40.275 position:21% line:83% align:start
in the end we thought
we had no choice.

01:25:40.976 --> 01:25:42.911 position:21% line:83% align:start
Since the Prince has
been avoiding us...

01:25:42.945 --> 01:25:44.947 position:10% line:83% align:start
it was our decision to try to
collect our payment from her.

01:25:46.116 --> 01:25:48.650 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's why we have come
to call on your residence.

01:25:48.985 --> 01:25:50.420 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

01:25:50.453 --> 01:25:52.122 position:7% line:89% align:start
I understand. I'll talk to him.

01:25:54.023 --> 01:25:55.792 position:24% line:89% align:start
Sir, what's going--

01:25:57.127 --> 01:25:59.796 position:21% line:83% align:start
Where have you gone?
Where, where's the...

01:26:00.364 --> 01:26:01.664 position:24% line:89% align:start
Where's the branch?

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.770 position:10% line:83% align:start
Father, I'm afraid the Prince
has taken his leave.

01:26:06.804 --> 01:26:08.005 position:41% line:89% align:start
He has?

01:26:10.074 --> 01:26:11.842 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

01:26:12.176 --> 01:26:13.177 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

01:26:14.312 --> 01:26:16.381 position:24% line:83% align:start
We should at least
reward the artisans,

01:26:16.414 --> 01:26:19.317 position:19% line:83% align:start
they really did quite a
nice job with that branch.

01:26:22.854 --> 01:26:23.855 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

[whimpers]

01:26:42.775 --> 01:26:43.776 position:16% line:89% align:start
Feast your eyes on this!

01:26:44.810 --> 01:26:47.046 position:24% line:83% align:start
It shimmers with an
absolutely wondrous light!

01:26:47.381 --> 01:26:48.781 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hmm, mm.

01:26:49.349 --> 01:26:49.882 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's extraordinary.

01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:51.919 position:19% line:83% align:start
In all the world there
has never been

01:26:51.952 --> 01:26:54.688 position:10% line:83% align:start
an engagement gift as costly
as the one I'm holding here.

01:26:55.956 --> 01:26:58.258 position:21% line:83% align:start
However, if it should
please Princess Kaguya,

01:26:58.292 --> 01:26:59.893 position:7% line:89% align:start
the expense is really nothing.

01:26:59.927 --> 01:27:03.063 position:21% line:83% align:start
A mere trifle to win
the heart of this lovely damsel.

01:27:03.097 --> 01:27:04.265 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

01:27:04.299 --> 01:27:04.932 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Princess]
In that case, then...

01:27:06.067 --> 01:27:08.870 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, the Princess is close by.

01:27:08.903 --> 01:27:09.938 position:21% line:89% align:start
Drop it in the fire.

01:27:10.338 --> 01:27:11.339 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:13.708 position:35% line:89% align:start
Excuse me?

01:27:15.076 --> 01:27:16.445 position:19% line:83% align:start
If it is truly made of
fire-rat fur,

01:27:18.012 --> 01:27:22.418 position:10% line:83% align:start
it will not burn, but merely
glisten all the brighter.

01:27:22.451 --> 01:27:24.353 position:21% line:89% align:start
Of course, Princess!

01:27:24.386 --> 01:27:26.322 position:7% line:89% align:start
This fire-rat robe is no fake!

01:27:26.355 --> 01:27:27.056 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's genuine. Genuine!

01:27:28.257 --> 01:27:30.893 position:21% line:83% align:start
If placed in the fire
it should not burn.

01:27:31.428 --> 01:27:32.728 position:24% line:89% align:start
But I fear that...

01:27:33.463 --> 01:27:36.233 position:5% line:89% align:start
between the Princess and myself,

01:27:36.266 --> 01:27:37.833 position:19% line:89% align:start
there remains an issue.

01:27:37.867 --> 01:27:39.502 position:5% line:89% align:start
A grain of unwarranted impurity.

01:27:39.536 --> 01:27:42.138 position:16% line:83% align:start
A question of my veracity
on the subject.

01:27:42.172 --> 01:27:42.973 position:33% line:89% align:start
Is that true?

01:27:43.541 --> 01:27:45.308 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's very possible.

01:27:45.342 --> 01:27:47.744 position:19% line:83% align:start
All the more reason to
put it in the fire.

01:27:48.945 --> 01:27:53.184 position:16% line:83% align:start

the Minister of the Right

01:29:47.071 --> 01:29:49.907 position:27% line:83% align:start
actually spent to
create that fake?

01:29:49.941 --> 01:29:53.077 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm sure that's all I am to
those gentlemen.

01:29:53.379 --> 01:29:54.413 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

01:29:54.446 --> 01:29:56.281 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm a fake jeweled branch

01:29:56.315 --> 01:29:58.951 position:19% line:83% align:start
or a fire-rat fur robe
that turns to ashes.

01:30:00.319 --> 01:30:02.921 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well both of them were
very expensive, it would seem.

01:30:04.056 --> 01:30:05.525 position:27% line:83% align:start
But have no fear,
your suitors are trying!

he's traveling to Tsukushi

- He's doing everything he can

to bring you to him.

01:30:19.305 --> 01:30:20.574 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's quite a story.

01:30:20.608 --> 01:30:22.942 position:21% line:83% align:start

his wife far away,

and is in the process of

01:30:24.177 --> 01:30:26.347 position:21% line:83% align:start
completely rebuilding
his mansion.

01:30:27.348 --> 01:30:29.116 position:16% line:89% align:start
A warrior's determination

other than the bowl?

Please just give it to her.

Since first I heard her voice

01:32:56.172 --> 01:32:57.340 position:24% line:89% align:start
three years ago...

01:32:57.373 --> 01:33:00.578 position:10% line:83% align:start
Princess Kaguya has not left
my heart for even a moment.

01:33:01.445 --> 01:33:02.446 position:19% line:89% align:start
I set out on my quest,

01:33:02.479 --> 01:33:05.215 position:16% line:83% align:start
desperately searching for
Buddha's begging bowl.

01:33:07.651 --> 01:33:09.688 position:30% line:83% align:start
Over meadow and
mountain I walked,

01:33:09.721 --> 01:33:11.422 position:24% line:83% align:start
calling on temples
throughout the land.

01:33:12.557 --> 01:33:14.359 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then, weary to the
point of exhaustion,

01:33:14.392 --> 01:33:17.228 position:21% line:83% align:start
I sat myself down by
a stone on the road.

01:33:18.563 --> 01:33:22.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
Suddenly, my eye was taken
by a beautiful wildflower

01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:23.836 position:27% line:83% align:start
that was growing
there at my feet.

01:33:25.170 --> 01:33:27.840 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ah! I was overwhelmed
by my feelings.

01:33:28.941 --> 01:33:31.176 position:16% line:83% align:start
My love for the Princess
spread within me

01:33:31.209 --> 01:33:33.111 position:24% line:83% align:start
like the blooms on
that exquisite flower.

01:33:34.914 --> 01:33:36.649 position:35% line:83% align:start
And I had a
moment of inspiration.

01:33:37.583 --> 01:33:38.885 position:10% line:89% align:start
It suddenly dawned on me that

01:33:38.919 --> 01:33:41.220 position:19% line:83% align:start
what I really wanted to
bring the Princess,

01:33:41.253 --> 01:33:43.422 position:27% line:83% align:start
and what she had
truly wished for,

01:33:43.456 --> 01:33:45.324 position:21% line:83% align:start
was not some distant
unattainable treasure,

01:33:45.959 --> 01:33:47.226 position:19% line:89% align:start
but this simple flower.

01:33:48.328 --> 01:33:49.796 position:27% line:83% align:start
Which is itself a
treasure of nature.

01:33:51.198 --> 01:33:52.566 position:21% line:83% align:start
This flower has come
to represent, for me,

01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:56.269 position:19% line:83% align:start
the devotion with which
I love the Princess.

01:33:56.704 --> 01:33:58.138 position:35% line:89% align:start
Devotion...

01:33:59.239 --> 01:34:01.809 position:27% line:83% align:start
Princess Kaguya!
In truth you are to me

01:34:03.210 --> 01:34:05.713 position:16% line:83% align:start
the only one whom I wish
to dedicate my heart.

01:34:06.581 --> 01:34:08.216 position:13% line:89% align:start
Could you please, perhaps,

01:34:08.249 --> 01:34:09.751 position:24% line:83% align:start
accept this lovely
flower as a token

01:34:10.652 --> 01:34:12.755 position:10% line:89% align:start
of the depth of my feelings?

01:34:15.390 --> 01:34:16.625 position:16% line:89% align:start
Since I was a small boy,

01:34:16.659 --> 01:34:18.594 position:24% line:83% align:start
I have been fond of
flowers and other plants.

01:34:19.795 --> 01:34:22.231 position:19% line:83% align:start
I am also entranced by
the nameless flowers

01:34:22.264 --> 01:34:24.566 position:19% line:83% align:start
that grow by roadsides
or in meadows...

01:34:25.367 --> 01:34:26.568 position:27% line:89% align:start
and in my heart,

01:34:26.602 --> 01:34:28.705 position:7% line:89% align:start
I always wish that I could live

01:34:29.939 --> 01:34:32.609 position:24% line:83% align:start
as do these flowers
that bloom in the field.

01:34:37.847 --> 01:34:42.318 position:10% line:83% align:start
Princess, I want you to come
with me to that place...

01:34:44.454 --> 01:34:46.791 position:27% line:83% align:start
together we could
leave this loud city

01:34:46.824 --> 01:34:47.725 position:21% line:89% align:start
and its formalities.

01:34:48.659 --> 01:34:50.561 position:5% line:89% align:start
We could go to a rich green land

01:34:50.594 --> 01:34:52.530 position:33% line:83% align:start
where flowers
bloom in perfusion,

01:34:52.563 --> 01:34:54.298 position:7% line:89% align:start
where birds sing and fish leap,

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.567 position:13% line:89% align:start
a place brimming with life.

01:34:57.568 --> 01:34:59.638 position:27% line:83% align:start
Let us laugh and
sleep and sing...

01:35:00.471 --> 01:35:02.339 position:16% line:89% align:start
let us follow our hearts.

01:35:03.442 --> 01:35:05.577 position:21% line:83% align:start
Take pleasure in the
tasks before us

01:35:05.610 --> 01:35:06.978 position:21% line:83% align:start
with the blessings of
the four seasons,

01:35:07.012 --> 01:35:08.413 position:13% line:89% align:start
our needs will be supplied

01:35:08.447 --> 01:35:09.915 position:24% line:83% align:start
and we'll spin out
a beautiful tale.

doesn't understand!

this effort, our Highness...

01:39:44.974 --> 01:39:45.675 position:19% line:89% align:start
will finally be happy!

01:39:46.776 --> 01:39:50.147 position:24% line:83% align:start
Father, I'm sorry,
but please refuse.

01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:51.547 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

01:39:51.581 --> 01:39:54.018 position:19% line:83% align:start

What are you talking about?

01:39:56.754 --> 01:39:58.022 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're refusing
to serve in court?

01:39:58.822 --> 01:40:00.591 position:16% line:89% align:start
Father, my answer is no.

01:40:01.291 --> 01:40:01.892 position:27% line:89% align:start
But you can't...

01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:04.962 position:19% line:83% align:start
No one in this land is
allowed to disobey

01:40:04.995 --> 01:40:06.630 position:16% line:83% align:start
an order from His Majesty
in the slightest degree.

So quit thinking of
just yourself, please!

01:40:13.104 --> 01:40:15.974 position:19% line:83% align:start
Father, if disobedience
to His Majesty

01:40:17.175 --> 01:40:20.179 position:21% line:83% align:start
is considered a crime
punishable by death...

01:40:21.613 --> 01:40:24.849 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well then... the only
choice is to kill me.

01:40:28.154 --> 01:40:30.689 position:5% line:89% align:start
Poppa, if your happiness depends

01:40:30.723 --> 01:40:32.825 position:21% line:83% align:start
on wearing the cap of
a court official,

01:40:33.959 --> 01:40:35.761 position:27% line:83% align:start
then I will go to
His Majesty as you wish.

01:40:37.130 --> 01:40:39.966 position:5% line:83% align:start
And after you've put on that cap
as part of the court,

01:40:40.733 --> 01:40:42.302 position:24% line:89% align:start
I will kill myself.

01:41:01.823 --> 01:41:03.825 position:13% line:83% align:start
She's turned down an offer
to live at the palace?

01:41:03.858 --> 01:41:06.228 position:27% line:83% align:start
No woman has ever

to play that game,

01:41:16.171 --> 01:41:18.707 position:16% line:83% align:start
