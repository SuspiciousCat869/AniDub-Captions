[Wataru] Sky.

00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:20,487
Blue.

3
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:23,156
Blue sky.

4
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:26,460
Clouds. White.

5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,395
White clouds.

00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:29,963

[yelling]

00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:06,994
[robot]
You men are under arrest.

16
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,263
Offer the least resistance
and you die.

17
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:10,797
Huh?

18
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,699
That voice.

19
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,402
Come with me, or I'll attack.

20
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:17,271
[tires screech]

[gun shots]

22
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,762
Your calmness
is extremely suspicious.

23
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,431
You're under arrest.
Follow my instructions.

24
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,669
You're armed. Throw down
your weapon immediately.

25
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,818
[tires screech]

26
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:06,987
Hit the turret.

27
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,989
Aim for the turret.

28
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,491
That's the nerve center.

29
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,328
[explosion]

30
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:33,514
Well done.

31
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:38,418
Hey, you can talk?
How come you can speak?

32
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,690
That was brave. To fight a robot

33
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:44,958
armed only with a magnum.

34
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,427
- What was it?
- A guardian.

35
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:51,765
A decade ago, violent riots
became increasingly frequent

36
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,267
here in San Francisco.

37
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,469
And the authorities developed
these machines

38
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:57,638
to maintain law and order.

39
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,873
This particular guardian must
have been on patrol

40
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,141
when the wind struck.

41
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:03,744
The pilot will have forgotten
how to open his cockpit,

42
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,846
or operator his ejector.

43
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,881
But even after he died slowly,

44
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:10,417
horribly of starvation
or lack of oxygen,

45
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,920
the computer which controlled
his machine

46
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,756
and which had been program
to detain or destroy

47
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:18,058
continued doing just that.

48
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,094
The guardian of an authority
that had long ceased to exist.

49
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,431
- Let's go.
- Okay.

50
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:28,535
[tires screech]

51
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:32,873
[Wataru] Who are you?
What's your name?

52
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:38,178
You know a lot. Things, words
that I don't know.

53
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,814
You haven't forgotten. Why?

54
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,383
Well, to start with,
I'm called Sophia.

55
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:46,520
I don't want to say anymore
about myself.

56
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:48,388
Tell me your story.
What's your name?

57
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:51,158
Of course, I didn't know
what my name was,

58
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,193
so Johnny called me Wataru.

59
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:57,130
He taught me all the words
I know.

60
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,133
And everything else come
to that.

61
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,302
[Sophia] Johnny?

62
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:03,937
Mm.

63
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:06,940
Mm-mm.

64
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:12,646
Johnny was 13,
three years younger than me.

65
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:15,649
But Johnny knew all kinds
of things that I didn't know.

66
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,486
And when you learned them,
you dumped him, huh?

67
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:22,890
Not quite.

68
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,726
He died.

69
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:34,835
I buried him,
then I hit the road.

70
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,776
I'm from a little town
in the foothills of the Rocky's

71
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,545
called... I don't remember.

72
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,314
It was an ordinary
sort of place.

73
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:51,318
If anything exciting ever
happened, I've forgotten it.

74
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,491
I think everybody
knew everybody else.

75
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:00,360
It must have been a friendly
sort of place.

76
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:02,829
[children giggling]

77
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,035
Platoon, quick, march.

78
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,503
[laughing]

79
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,148
But then, out of a clear sky,

80
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,650
the wind blew through our town.

81
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,691
And suddenly, when it had past,
everyone, not only in our town,

82
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:34,428
but everyone maybe in the whole
world had forgotten everything.

83
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:36,964
How to fly planes,

84
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,035
[explosion]

85
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:45,606
[truck horn]

00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,409

87
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:53,547
[explosion]

88
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:02,956
Everything had been forgotten.

89
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:06,326
It was as if we were all
babies again,

90
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:08,996
but babies with the strength
of grown men and woman.

91
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:10,864
Amnesia.

92
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,869
It's called amnesia.

93
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:19,139
No one was spared.

94
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:23,143
The wind blew into every corner
of the world,

95
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,079
and where it blew, it wiped
the slate of memory clean.

96
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,348
Only instinct remained.

97
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,567
I don't remember the following
days and weeks to clearly.

98
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:50,571
I just wondered around town,
unknowing, helpless.

99
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:54,241
And soon, people started
to feel hungry.

100
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,078
Food became the only necessity
and people fought for it

101
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,346
like savages.

102
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:02,149
In my town, at least, there was
still plenty for all but

103
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:03,450
that had been forgotten.

104
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:06,620
The old and weak were swept
aside without mercy,

105
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:09,223
parents abandoned their
children, not even knowing

106
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,324
they were theirs.

107
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,410
And I?

108
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:34,147
I was no better. No different
than all the rest.

109
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,386
I was hungry. That's all I knew.

110
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,863

[growling]

116
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:01,168
It wasn't an enemy,
but my own reflection.

117
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:02,536
I didn't understand.

118
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,238
And I didn't understand
the awful noise

119
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,706
the children were making.

120
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,742
I couldn't stand that noise.

121
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,143
[crying continues]

122
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,413
I didn't understand.

123
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:17,084
I had to destroy that face
staring at me.

124
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,721
And then, I ran out
of the house.

125
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,258
I was screaming.

126
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,929
I didn't know where I was going.
I just kept running

127
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:30,464
'till the town was behind me.

128
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:33,300
I didn't know where I was.

129
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:38,372
Maybe I had been here before,
but I couldn't remember.

130
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,976
There was a large
white building.

131
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:46,013
Bodies everywhere.

132
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,749
I had grown used to the sight
of death and destruction.

133
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:54,087
But here, in the bright sunshine
of this silent place,

134
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,657
I felt something darker.

135
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:59,293
More terrible than anything
I had yet come across.

136
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,164
I felt something watching me.

137
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,533
And then...

138
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:08,602
Then I saw it.

139
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,071
[rumbling]

140
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:21,348
A huge man

141
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:23,851
with wires attached to his head,
his body,

142
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,118
his arms and legs.

143
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:29,590
Threatening a boy, who sat
calm and still.

144
00:11:31,592 --> 00:11:32,926
They hadn't seen me.

145
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,128
I wasn't in danger.

146
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:38,432
But for some reason,
which I couldn't have explained

147
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:39,900
if I wanted to,

148
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:42,536
I knew I had to do something
to help that boy.

149
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,741
[tense music]

150
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:03,590

[yelling]

157
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,463
The boy was holding something
in his hand,

158
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,432
pointing it toward where the man
had fallen

159
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,535
with smoke coming out
at the front.

160
00:13:21,602 --> 00:13:23,704
Later I learned what it was.

161
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,344
- Thanks.
- Huh!

162
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,114
Don't be afraid.
Hey, you're from town.

163
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:35,182
Tell me,

164
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:37,417
He was talking
to me using words.

165
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,819
[Johnny] What's your name?

166
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:40,721
[Wataru] But I had forgotten
what they meant,

167
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:41,955
or even how to make them.

168
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:46,393
I couldn't speak,
and I couldn't even begin

169
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,161
to understand
what he was saying.

170
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:51,732
He took my hand,
and that felt good.

171
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,801
He smiled,
and I felt less afraid.

172
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:58,138
And that,

173
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:00,007
that was how I met Johnny.

174
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:05,913
[whirring]

175
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,551
[glass shatters]

176
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:26,900
I was in what Johnny called
a military research base.

177
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,903
They weren't just building
new machines,

178
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,306
they were turning people
into human weapons.

179
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,942
That's what Johnny was.

180
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:37,845
And the man with the wires
had been taught to move

181
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:40,314
and destroy objects
with his mind alone.

182
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:45,786
But the program was only partly
completed when the wind came.

183
00:14:45,853 --> 00:14:48,388
The doctors, the scientists lost
their memories at once,

184
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,824
but for some of the more
advance patients,

185
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:53,794
who'd been abandoned, the
process took a little longer.

186
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:58,065
Johnny told me they could have
destroyed New York

187
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,901
in an afternoon if the right
code had been activated.

188
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:04,404
Few of the experiments were not
directly aimed at destruction,

189
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:06,206
and Johnny's was one.

190
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:08,208
He was the subject
of the most advanced

191
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:09,877
memory experiment of all.

192
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:12,412
There's a limit to what human
minds can retain.

193
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,216
But data entered into a computer
will remain there forever.

194
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:19,720
It's memory keeps everything,
useful or not.

195
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:22,656
Johnny had a computer put
into his head

196
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:25,225
to take excess information
directly from his brain.

197
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:28,829
The wind that destroyed
human memory

198
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:31,031
couldn't effect the store
in Johnny's computer memory.

199
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:45,412
Johnny took me
to the center's laboratory,

200
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:48,682
which was still working,
controlled by its computers.

201
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:53,620
He put a machine over my head.
I was scared.

202
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:56,123
But by that time,
I trusted him completely.

203
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:00,627
[machines whirring]

204
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:15,442
Thirty minutes later,

205
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:19,079
I had the knowledge
of a five year old.

206
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,254
Where have I put my hand?

207
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:28,589
[Wataru] On the desk.

208
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,192
- Where's my hand now?
- On the chair.

209
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:33,994
And what's this white flower?

210
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:36,597
It's called a rose.
I tried to eat one.

211
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:40,200
- What was its taste?
- Uh.

212
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,370
I can't explain what it was.

213
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:44,972
But it made me throw up.

214
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,640
I see.

215
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:50,577
[gunshot]

216
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,515
What am I holding?

217
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:55,582
A pistol.

218
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,852
- Hm, what am I called?
- Wait a minute.

219
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,921
I must have told
you 10 times already.

220
00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:02,389
- My name's Johnny.
- Johnny!

221
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:03,457
I won't forget again.

222
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:08,195
So much to remember. It's hard.

223
00:17:08,262 --> 00:17:10,130
You don't remember your name,
do you?

224
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:11,598
No, I don't.

225
00:17:11,665 --> 00:17:13,467
Let's think of what to call you.

226
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:16,537
I suppose the name that
describes the role you'll play

227
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:18,071
in the world which the winds
left us.

228
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:20,240
- A name like Wataru.
- Sounds pretty odd.

229
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:22,342
It's a Japanese word
that means traveler,

230
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:23,877
which is what you'll be.

231
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:26,547
Because your role will be to
travel all over the world

232
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:29,049
helping men to relearn
what they have forgotten.

233
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:31,018
[Wataru] Whatever my name
had been before,

234
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:32,653
from that day, I became Wataru.

235
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,988
[birds chirping]

236
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,666
I had one more session
on Johnny's machine.

237
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:49,736
After that, for some reason,
it didn't work anymore.

238
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:52,873
But thanks to the machine,
I had learned a great deal.

239
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,843
I understood that I was part
of the human race.

240
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:00,514
I learned that the land I saw
about me was called Montana.

241
00:18:00,981 --> 00:18:03,417
That this was part of a country
called America,

242
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:06,386
which in turn, was part
of a planet, Earth.

243
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:10,457
And that this planet spinning
around the sun

244
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:13,327
was a tiny speck
in the infinite universe.

245
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:18,565
Most important of all,
I was able to ask questions.

246
00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:20,667
And the most puzzling
question was:

247
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:22,402
What had happened to the world.

248
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:27,441
You know what happened when the
wind blew over the Earth.

249
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:29,042
Everything that had been
learned,

250
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,377
everything men had achieved

251
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:32,412
in the time since progressing
from the apes

252
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:35,282
was forgotten. Their memories
were wiped clean.

253
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,718
They forgot everything
they created.

254
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,753
The music, the paintings,
the science.

255
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,022
Even their families,
their names.

256
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:45,192
They forgot how to use their
machines and what they were for.

257
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:48,028
All these things were blow away.
We know that.

258
00:18:48,095 --> 00:18:49,630
The question
is not what happened,

259
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:51,198
but what made it happen.

260
00:18:51,265 --> 00:18:54,268
For instance, a military
experiment which was fired.

261
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,270
A military experiment?

262
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:58,105
You mean the forces destroyed
the people

263
00:18:58,172 --> 00:19:00,132
they were really supposed
to have been protecting?

264
00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:02,943
It's possible. I don't know.

265
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,783
Perhaps we'll never know.

266
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,785
But whoever's behind it,
it's without a doubt

267
00:19:11,852 --> 00:19:14,354
the biggest catastrophe that's
ever been seen in the world.

268
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:18,058
It could have been unleashed by
men who had become so convinced

269
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,294
of their great wisdom, it never
occurred to them

270
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,095
their inventions where out
of control.

271
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,399
Or perhaps beings
from another world

272
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:29,703
looked down on man and saw
he was becoming

273
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,438
so dangerous to the universe

274
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:33,807
that they were compelled
to stop him.

275
00:19:33,941 --> 00:19:35,142
[relaxing music]

276
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:39,847
[panting]

277
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:53,393
Woo-hoo!

278
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:01,235
[panting]

279
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:10,777
[Wataru] Every day, Johnny
taught me something new.

280
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:13,714
Building on the basic knowledge
his machine had given me.

281
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:19,586
He taught me things I would need
to know simply to survive.

282
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:21,021
[gunshots]

283
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:27,294
I'd practice
until he was satisfied.

284
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:32,499
He taught me how to drive.

285
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,838
That the stars could be used
to find out where I was.

286
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:46,947
That some plants can be eaten,
but some are poisonous.

287
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:50,717
[birds chirping]

288
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:04,798
He also taught
me how to have fun.

289
00:21:07,201 --> 00:21:11,305
But as summer ended,
Johnny began to grow weaker.

290
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:13,373
Sometimes he would sleep
the whole day.

291
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:19,379
Or just lie quietly in his bed,
too exhausted to move.

292
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:34,027
[wind blows]

293
00:21:36,163 --> 00:21:37,331
[Wataru] How do you feel?

294
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:41,168
[Johnny] Some days, I feel more
full of life than ever.

295
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:44,671
Look, Wataru. A pair of mountain
blue birds.

296
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:47,007
Winter's almost here.

297
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:50,410
They'll fly south for the warmth
of Colorado or California.

298
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,679
But we won't see them again
until next spring.

299
00:21:53,046 --> 00:21:54,882
They have no memory as we
understand it,

300
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:57,150
only instincts, so they have
lost nothing.

301
00:21:57,217 --> 00:21:58,352
I envy them.

302
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:01,555
The rules they live
by are so simple.

303
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,024
[Wataru] Going into town for
food and gas

304
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:05,092
was getting dangerous.

305
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:08,328
I'd see gangs of men fighting
with rocks and clubs.

306
00:22:08,395 --> 00:22:09,696
And now, disused buildings

307
00:22:09,763 --> 00:22:11,598
were starting to crumble
and collapse.

308
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:14,868
Johnny, the road into the town's
nearly been cut by...

309
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:23,944
Johnny was dead.

310
00:22:25,946 --> 00:22:28,015
I stood by his bed,

311
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:30,384
and remembered the last words
he had spoken to me.

312
00:22:31,385 --> 00:22:32,753
[Johnny] Wataru.

313
00:22:33,153 --> 00:22:34,821
You will soon have
to leave here.

314
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:39,560
I've tried to prepared
you for a task,

315
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:41,094
which no one else can complete.

316
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:44,998
You must travel to the four
corners of this land,

317
00:22:45,065 --> 00:22:46,834
perhaps right around the world,

318
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,036
and see what is left
of the things that man

319
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:50,204
has built and done.

320
00:22:50,771 --> 00:22:53,607
Those you'll meet will have no
memory of how their fathers

321
00:22:53,674 --> 00:22:57,010
slowly, slowly built up a way
of living, which finally,

322
00:22:57,077 --> 00:23:00,347
perhaps not quite
destroyed itself.

323
00:23:00,414 --> 00:23:03,550
Man has returned to a primitive
basic state.

324
00:23:03,617 --> 00:23:06,119
You alone can understand that.

325
00:23:06,186 --> 00:23:09,156
You alone can look back
on history and show man

326
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:10,991
where their empty ambitions led.

327
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:14,761
You must teach them new aims,
new desires,

328
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:17,030
to take them in a new direction

329
00:23:17,097 --> 00:23:20,167
where they will achieve
what they are capable of.

330
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,435
[sighs]

331
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,899
[Wataru] And so I started
my journey.

332
00:23:51,965 --> 00:23:54,735
I didn't know where I was going.
It didn't matter.

333
00:23:57,905 --> 00:24:00,274
- I still don't understand.
- What?

334
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,876
Suppose that Johnny was right,
and the wind was caused

335
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:04,478
by beings from a different
world.

336
00:24:04,545 --> 00:24:06,246
Assuming it wasn't a mistake,

337
00:24:06,313 --> 00:24:07,714
they must have
had a definite plan.

338
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:09,349
I can't answer you.

339
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:11,351
Perhaps they didn't want
to destroy man,

340
00:24:11,418 --> 00:24:13,720
but simply point them along
a different way.

341
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:16,027
Try to make them act in ways
which aren't so destructive.

342
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:17,624
What do you mean?

343
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:19,459
Rescue him by disabling him?

344
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:21,695
That makes no sense!

345
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:23,297
Yes, it is puzzling.

346
00:24:24,198 --> 00:24:27,067
You can't assume that beings
more powerful than man

347
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:28,535
are necessarily wiser.

348
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:37,511
We can't stay here
any longer, Wataru.

349
00:24:37,578 --> 00:24:40,080
The guard whom you confronted
has a computerized

350
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:41,281
self-repair program.

351
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:45,085
It won't be long before it
resumes its search and destroy

352
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:46,587
mission against you.

353
00:24:58,532 --> 00:24:59,772
[Wataru] Hey, I never got around

354
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,201
to asking where you're heading.

355
00:25:01,268 --> 00:25:02,302
[Sophia] New York.

356
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:03,704
[whistles]

357
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,473
Quite a way. Think you'll make
it one piece?

358
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,543
Yes. But I know I'd have a
better chance with you along.

359
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:12,012
I told Johnny I'd go to all
the big cities in America

360
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,514
to see what I could do there.

361
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,082
I'm not going to go back
on my word.

362
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:18,051
So if you don't mind
some detours.

363
00:25:18,118 --> 00:25:19,786
No, I don't mind at all.

364
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:22,389
Okay, then. Let's do it!

365
00:25:23,657 --> 00:25:25,092
Okay, let's.

366
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:42,476
It's eerie being
in this huge city

367
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:44,244
that doesn't seem to have any
people in it.

368
00:25:45,012 --> 00:25:47,814
Things may have gotten so tough,
that everybody ran away.

369
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:49,249
Huh? [Footsteps]

370
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,420
[tense music]

371
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:58,692
[grunting]

372
00:26:02,095 --> 00:26:03,463
- Wait!
- But the girl!

373
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,765
Be careful.

374
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:07,067
You may not realize what's going
on with these people,

375
00:26:07,134 --> 00:26:08,836
or exactly why they're
after her.

376
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:11,772
They've had to make up new rules
because they found the old ones

377
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,540
are no use to them any longer.

378
00:26:13,607 --> 00:26:14,708
Let me go!

379
00:26:40,067 --> 00:26:41,468
[gunshot]

380
00:26:50,978 --> 00:26:52,246
[chuckles]

381
00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:07,528
Don't be scared.

382
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:09,363
You're okay now.

383
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:12,766
Uh, um. See?

384
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:14,935
[growls]

385
00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:17,471
Um, calm down.

386
00:27:17,538 --> 00:27:19,806
I think I can reach him.
Let me talk to him.

387
00:27:23,544 --> 00:27:25,212
[growling]

388
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,422
It's alright now. It's alright.

389
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,791
[grunts]

390
00:27:44,064 --> 00:27:47,201
I've been able to communicate
with them to some extent.

391
00:27:48,602 --> 00:27:51,738
Her name is Sue,
he's called Little John.

392
00:27:51,805 --> 00:27:54,575
Their people have chosen her
to be the bride of their god.

393
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:56,962
Tomorrow is to have been the day
of her marriage.

394
00:27:57,244 --> 00:27:59,079
Well, so what? Is that bad?

395
00:27:59,813 --> 00:28:02,583
It would not have been happy.
She was about to be sacrificed.

396
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:05,352
To a god? Human sacrifice?

397
00:28:05,485 --> 00:28:07,921
Yes. The god that
they believe in

398
00:28:07,988 --> 00:28:10,290
demands a succession of brides.

399
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:12,459
In return, he spares the rest
of the people.

400
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,761
[groans]

401
00:28:16,597 --> 00:28:17,598
[panting]

402
00:28:33,747 --> 00:28:34,948
[yelling]

403
00:28:39,186 --> 00:28:40,487
[screaming]

404
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:53,166
Poor kid. No wonder
she's got nightmares.

405
00:28:54,501 --> 00:28:56,570
But does their god really exist.

406
00:28:57,204 --> 00:28:58,205
Perhaps.

407
00:28:58,572 --> 00:29:00,741
What's important for you
to remember is that the men

408
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:02,709
who were chasing her
believe it does.

409
00:29:02,776 --> 00:29:05,712
So to those men, sacrificing
her to appease him is natural.

410
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:07,114
It's disgusting!

411
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:08,825
[Sophia] Sacrifices were
offered to the gods

412
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:10,050
for thousands of years

413
00:29:10,117 --> 00:29:12,586
after man first looked up
and recognized unknowable

414
00:29:12,653 --> 00:29:13,921
forces ruling him.

415
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:15,322
In terms of his history
on earth,

416
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:17,691
the custom was stopped only
the blink of an eye, though.

417
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:21,094
And now that the wind has blown
away the old restraints,

418
00:29:21,161 --> 00:29:24,464
the old certainties, it's not
surprising he's returned to it.

419
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:27,568
And you. Are you so certain
of your own values

420
00:29:27,634 --> 00:29:30,871
that you're prepared to impose
them unthinkingly on others?

421
00:29:30,938 --> 00:29:32,940
To choose their way of life
for them?

422
00:29:33,006 --> 00:29:35,042
To tell them what is good
and what is bad?

423
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:37,477
Demanding obedience by force
if necessary?

424
00:29:38,312 --> 00:29:39,880
You don't understand yet.

425
00:29:39,947 --> 00:29:42,516
Anyway, the sacrificial ceremony
or marriage,

426
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:44,852
if they'd rather call it that,
is scheduled to take place

427
00:29:44,918 --> 00:29:47,020
in front of their altar
tomorrow night.

428
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:48,722
If they recapture her by then.

429
00:29:50,657 --> 00:29:51,692
I feel for her.

430
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:54,328
A marriage to a god,
which she didn't want,

431
00:29:54,394 --> 00:29:55,805
wouldn't have been enough
to make her run away.

432
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:57,998
But if her life's threatened
as well,

433
00:29:58,065 --> 00:30:00,400
she has the right to live
her own life.

434
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:01,468
Mm-hm.

435
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:03,971
What?

436
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:07,441
Have I said something funny?

437
00:30:08,442 --> 00:30:09,443
No.

438
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:13,247
On the contrary, what you just
said made perfect sense.

439
00:30:22,122 --> 00:30:24,558
[Wataru] It's dangerous for Sue
to be outside in daylight.

440
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:25,926
[Sophia] I don't think so.

441
00:30:26,393 --> 00:30:29,630
According to her, there are
hardly any people left.

442
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,199
They've all gone
into the countryside

443
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:34,434
where it's easier for them
to find food.

444
00:30:35,302 --> 00:30:38,005
And so the chances of her
meeting anyone who'll try

445
00:30:38,071 --> 00:30:40,240
to force her to return
to face her sacrifice

446
00:30:40,307 --> 00:30:42,376
in a city as big as this
is pretty small.

447
00:30:42,442 --> 00:30:43,482
Especially, if she's found

448
00:30:43,544 --> 00:30:45,279
herself such a
faithful bodyguard.

449
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:46,580
Sounds reasonable.

450
00:30:46,647 --> 00:30:47,648
Listen.

451
00:30:48,315 --> 00:30:49,650
Suppose we were to drive them

452
00:30:49,716 --> 00:30:51,718
both down to the beach
for the afternoon.

453
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:54,922
It wouldn't surprise me
if they hadn't been there

454
00:30:54,988 --> 00:30:56,023
since the wind.

455
00:30:58,292 --> 00:30:59,326
[grunts]

456
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:03,397
[giggles]

457
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,471
[Wataru] I understand about
Sue now,

458
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:13,240
but what do you make
of Little John?

459
00:31:13,307 --> 00:31:15,175
[Sophia] I haven't found out
much about him.

460
00:31:15,242 --> 00:31:17,344
But I like the way
he's so gentle with her.

461
00:31:19,813 --> 00:31:21,081
Do you care about her?

462
00:31:21,148 --> 00:31:23,750
Mm. I've made up my mind.
We'll be taking them

463
00:31:23,817 --> 00:31:25,152
so she won't be sacrificed.

464
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:27,154
And maybe, I can teach them
a bit.

465
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:28,222
Hey.

466
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,968
[waves crashing]

467
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:43,136
[seagulls]

468
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:19,339
[giggling]

469
00:32:25,412 --> 00:32:27,514
Help! He's gone insane!

470
00:32:27,581 --> 00:32:29,483
Sophia, help me!

471
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:32,119
[giggles]

472
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,225
Calm down.

473
00:32:42,663 --> 00:32:43,931
[yells]

474
00:32:48,402 --> 00:32:49,736
[giggles]

475
00:32:51,104 --> 00:32:52,105
Oh...

476
00:33:04,518 --> 00:33:05,519
[gasps]

477
00:34:07,614 --> 00:34:10,851
You look great.
No offense. Understand?

478
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:12,753
No, of course you don't.

479
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:14,655
Well, I'm going to find us
something to eat,

480
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:17,257
then hit the sack. We've got
an early start tomorrow.

481
00:34:23,463 --> 00:34:24,464
Sophia!

482
00:34:27,868 --> 00:34:30,604
Here, see? I found some stuff
for a party.

483
00:34:30,671 --> 00:34:33,974
Hey, where have Sue
and Little John gone to?

484
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:37,244
- Have they gone inside?
- No, Wataru. They've just gone.

485
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:38,312
Eh?

486
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:40,781
Wasn't it obvious from the way
Sue behaved today,

487
00:34:40,848 --> 00:34:43,283
what she felt?
You must have noticed.

488
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:46,253
Everything she did was as if
she'd never have opportunity

489
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,722
to repeat it. Everything was as
if today was the last day

490
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:49,790
she'd spend on earth.

491
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:53,827
She knew that if she didn't
go back, then some other girl

492
00:34:53,894 --> 00:34:56,663
would be sacrificed to the god
in her place.

493
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,165
So she returned.

494
00:34:58,632 --> 00:34:59,633
Shit!

495
00:35:02,569 --> 00:35:04,304
Where do you think you're going?

496
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:07,341
I won't let them sacrifice Sue!
I won't let them kill her

497
00:35:07,407 --> 00:35:09,243
because of some superstition!

498
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:13,046
I'll rescue her! Her, and the
other girls who are in danger.

499
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:14,414
Get in!

500
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:20,354
Little John dropped
this when he ran after Sue.

501
00:35:22,055 --> 00:35:23,757
He doesn't know what it means,

502
00:35:23,824 --> 00:35:25,959
but he understand that there
are rules different

503
00:35:26,026 --> 00:35:27,594
to those he lives by now.

[Sophia] It's a computerized
urban-construction robot.

508
00:36:16,243 --> 00:36:19,246
As its chief function is to
destroy buildings on sites

509
00:36:19,313 --> 00:36:20,547
that are to be redeveloped,

510
00:36:20,614 --> 00:36:22,950
it's equipped with powerful
destructive devices.

511
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:24,718
Added robot arms
and laser canon.

512
00:36:25,586 --> 00:36:28,155
It's caterpillar traction allows
it to move at great speed

513
00:36:28,222 --> 00:36:29,556
over any terrain.

514
00:36:29,623 --> 00:36:31,758
It can flatten a small city
in a day.

515
00:36:32,259 --> 00:36:34,461
And it's this machine
they worship as a god.

Look, Wataru.

519
00:37:03,423 --> 00:37:05,259
Somehow, he must have learned
how it works,

520
00:37:05,325 --> 00:37:07,327
which has given him power
over the rest.

521
00:37:15,536 --> 00:37:16,537

You've destroyed him, Wataru.

It's the end of their
all-powerful god.

Wataru?

539
00:41:10,571 --> 00:41:12,072
- What is it?
- Wataru.

540
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:13,507
I'll make a bet with you.

541
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:15,209
A bet?

542
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,744
You said Sue and Little John
should come with us

543
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:20,113
on our journey and you might
teach them what you learned

544
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,281
from Johnny on the way.

545
00:41:22,115 --> 00:41:25,085
They didn't come, and I'll bet
that no one will join us.

546
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:27,988
What do you want to bet?
Somebody will want to learn.

547
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:35,095
Okay, I'll take the bet.
What's the stake?

548
00:41:35,762 --> 00:41:39,099
The future of this planet.
Whether man will survive on it.

549
00:41:39,566 --> 00:41:40,567
Huh?

Yeah.

553
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:18,772
And this is your badge
of leadership.

554
00:42:19,973 --> 00:42:21,742
Sue's gone, Little John.

555
00:42:21,808 --> 00:42:23,911
You won't know anyone like
her again,

556
00:42:23,977 --> 00:42:26,113
but maybe you can care
for other people

557
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,681
the way you cared for her.

558

I wish I wasn't so sure I'll win
our bet.

00:43:03,317 --> 00:43:04,351
We'll see.

Wataru.

565
00:43:34,915 --> 00:43:36,683
As a result of people
you have met,

566
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:39,520
have you learned yet what being
a human being really means?

567
00:43:40,254 --> 00:43:41,889
They're a complex breed.

568
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:44,625
It's not always easy to see
what drives them on.

569
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:45,792
Hm.

570
00:43:46,393 --> 00:43:48,829
What's driving you on, Wataru?

571
00:43:48,896 --> 00:43:51,331
What do you want? Tell me.

572
00:43:51,398 --> 00:43:52,733
It's hard to say.

573
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:56,803
I'm not sure myself, but...
Look up there.

574
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,472
See those clouds in the sky?

575
00:43:58,539 --> 00:44:00,007
Maybe they're above a town,

576
00:44:00,073 --> 00:44:02,376
and in that town I'll meet
somebody who can teach me

577
00:44:02,442 --> 00:44:04,678
all the things Johnny never
had time to.

578
00:44:05,879 --> 00:44:08,248
Before the wind, man must have
been curious

579
00:44:08,315 --> 00:44:10,784
about all kinds of things
they've got no time for now.

580
00:44:10,851 --> 00:44:12,486
But I'm curious, and I want
to learn.

581
00:44:12,553 --> 00:44:15,389
Yes, it's because they were
curious that people progressed.

582
00:44:15,455 --> 00:44:16,990
All progress couldn't have
been bad.

583
00:44:17,124 --> 00:44:19,026
- Quiet.
- What's the matter?

584
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:20,527
We're being followed.

585
00:44:20,827 --> 00:44:21,828
What?

00:45:33,467 --> 00:45:35,068
and not even serious cuts.

593
00:45:35,135 --> 00:45:37,371
Just one or two scratches
and bruises.

595
00:45:40,974 --> 00:45:44,278
Where am I? Is Sophia alright?
Is she here?

596
00:45:44,344 --> 00:45:48,148
Now, now, don't get excited.
Just lie back and take it easy.

597
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:51,485
I heard this terrible noise
on the edge of town,

598
00:45:51,552 --> 00:45:54,421
and so I drove out to find
what had caused it.

599
00:45:54,488 --> 00:45:57,958
And there was your jeep lying
on its side next to a big crater

600
00:45:58,025 --> 00:45:59,265
with burnt grass all around it.

601
00:46:00,127 --> 00:46:02,529
You were unconscious,
but otherwise,

602
00:46:02,596 --> 00:46:04,565
there was absolutely nothing
wrong with you.

603
00:46:04,631 --> 00:46:06,767
I wish I had half your strength.

604
00:46:11,271 --> 00:46:12,806
Oh, there you are.

605
00:46:12,873 --> 00:46:15,909
I was amazed to discover that
she got away without a scratch.

606
00:46:15,976 --> 00:46:16,977
Incredible.

607
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:21,481
- Sophia.
- I'll look in later.

608
00:46:21,548 --> 00:46:22,549
Sophia!

609
00:46:24,218 --> 00:46:26,520
Listen, how come he treated me?

610
00:46:26,587 --> 00:46:28,255
And how come he can talk?

611
00:46:28,322 --> 00:46:29,590
Haven't people in this part

612
00:46:29,656 --> 00:46:31,058
of the country lost
their memories?

613
00:46:35,362 --> 00:46:36,363
Wow.

614
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:38,932
[Sophia] The US government
designed and built

615
00:46:38,999 --> 00:46:42,536
this eternal city at the
beginning of the 21st century.

616
00:46:45,606 --> 00:46:48,775
The beauty of it is, is that
it's completely self-contained

617
00:46:48,842 --> 00:46:51,478
with its own hospital,
university, parks,

618
00:46:51,545 --> 00:46:52,880
suburbs and surfaces.

619
00:46:53,847 --> 00:46:56,517
The farms in the city limits
are big enough to supply

620
00:46:56,583 --> 00:46:58,552
all the food that's required.

621
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:01,288
The whole system's controlled
by supercomputer.

622
00:47:01,922 --> 00:47:04,224
The guardians are programmed
so they cannot enter.

623
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:06,393
That's all fair enough,
but why didn't people

624
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,095
lose their memories
here as well?

625
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:10,664
We'll answer that later.

626
00:47:11,832 --> 00:47:13,767
For now you must sleep and get
your strength back

627
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:15,769
- so we can travel on.
- Yeah.

628
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:18,071
You're right.

Huh? [Door opens]

Oh, miss.

633
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:35,689
- Excuse me.
- I don't answer to 'miss'.

634
00:47:35,756 --> 00:47:38,091
Call me charge nurse,
which is who I am.

635
00:47:39,426 --> 00:47:41,461
And that's what I'd like
to be called.

636
00:47:41,528 --> 00:47:43,230
- I hope that's clear.
- Yes.

637
00:47:43,297 --> 00:47:44,898
I'm sorry, but you're so young.

638
00:47:44,965 --> 00:47:47,701
You just relax. I'll take care
of everything.

639
00:47:52,172 --> 00:47:54,975
- Pull up your sleeve.
- Oh, there.

640
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:56,043
[knock]

641
00:47:57,611 --> 00:47:59,213
I've been trying to find
you, burse.

642
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,782
Back to bed at once!

643
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:05,886
Really, Mr. Simpson. You know
you're not allowed up

644
00:48:05,953 --> 00:48:07,487
even if you're feeling better.

645
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:10,991
I know, but I felt so lonely
without anyone else to talk to.

646
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:12,826
Alright, I'll be there in a
minute.

647
00:48:13,227 --> 00:48:15,162
You're really a terrible
handful!

648
00:48:17,798 --> 00:48:19,666
[Wataru] What the hell is going
on here?

649
00:48:23,704 --> 00:48:24,872
[cocks gun]

650
00:49:20,727 --> 00:49:21,962
[pants]

651
00:49:45,786 --> 00:49:46,820
[gasps]

652
00:49:48,622 --> 00:49:49,890
Mind if I join you, miss?

653
00:49:50,924 --> 00:49:51,925
Uh.

654
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:54,862
Please do.

655
00:49:55,762 --> 00:49:58,165
I often see you reading here
around this time.

656
00:50:01,335 --> 00:50:02,336
Yes.

657
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:04,571
It's peaceful in the park.

658
00:50:06,273 --> 00:50:07,407
You know...

659
00:50:08,108 --> 00:50:11,011
I've wanted to talk to you
for a long time.

660
00:50:11,078 --> 00:50:14,815
It's like a play.
They're playing parts.

661
00:50:23,423 --> 00:50:24,424
Sophia!

662
00:50:24,491 --> 00:50:26,159
Are you beginning to figure
it out?

663
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,896
No, I'm not. What's going on?

664
00:50:29,796 --> 00:50:31,465
This is a very
interesting place.

665
00:50:31,532 --> 00:50:33,033
Those two on that bench.

666
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,002
What do you find so surprising
about them?

667
00:50:35,502 --> 00:50:36,970
An old couple in the park.

668
00:50:37,371 --> 00:50:38,872
[pants]

669
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:44,778
Ah, I've caught up with you
at last. Thank god.

670
00:50:48,115 --> 00:50:50,284
The mayor would be delighted
if you two could join her

671
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:52,553
for a little supper
this evening.

672
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:55,656
Isn't that kind of her.
If you'd like to take us.

673
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:57,391
With pleasure. This way.

674
00:50:57,457 --> 00:50:58,592
[Wataru] This is weird.

675
00:51:09,002 --> 00:51:11,672
If you'll be seated.
The mayor won't be long.

676
00:51:13,974 --> 00:51:17,244
Hey, this spread's amazing.

677
00:51:17,311 --> 00:51:18,745
I wonder who made it.

678
00:51:25,419 --> 00:51:27,754
Everything's run automatically
by the computer.

679
00:51:28,388 --> 00:51:30,324
Those two have everything
they want here.

680
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:32,459
I can't imagine a reason
for the pair of them

681
00:51:32,526 --> 00:51:34,661
should ever exchange this place
for the outside.

682
00:51:34,728 --> 00:51:36,230
[mayor]
Welcome to the eternal city.

683
00:51:40,133 --> 00:51:43,337
I'm so pleased you're well
enough to have joined me.

684
00:51:43,403 --> 00:51:45,772
I wish I was as young and strong
as you.

685
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,374
Now, please, do begin.

686
00:51:47,441 --> 00:51:49,376
If you want something different,
do please say.

687
00:51:52,246 --> 00:51:55,382
Come on, start. You've forgotten
how lovely meals can look.

688
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,188
[clock ticks]

689
00:52:04,057 --> 00:52:05,325
[whirring]

690
00:52:07,828 --> 00:52:08,829
Mm.

691
00:52:09,563 --> 00:52:12,266
May I ask a question
that's bothering me?

692
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,968
Yes, do.

693
00:52:15,035 --> 00:52:18,539
Do you know what happened to the
rest of the world two years ago?

694
00:52:18,605 --> 00:52:19,606
Oh, yes.

695
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:23,877
Well, then, why do you and
Mr. Simpson still have memories?

696
00:52:23,944 --> 00:52:26,880
Not only your own, but those
of other people as well?

697
00:52:30,551 --> 00:52:31,552
Huh?

698
00:52:34,421 --> 00:52:37,124
The answer isn't entirely clear
even to me.

699
00:52:37,191 --> 00:52:39,726
But the wind affected us as well
as you outside.

700
00:52:40,961 --> 00:52:45,332
It affected not only the people
living here in the eternal city,

701
00:52:45,399 --> 00:52:48,235
but also the supercomputer
which manages our affairs.

702
00:52:48,302 --> 00:52:49,369
It didn't forget,

703
00:52:49,436 --> 00:52:50,737
but it became very confused.

704
00:52:51,672 --> 00:52:54,675
Before it managed to repair
itself, many lives were lost.

705
00:52:54,741 --> 00:52:56,944
The computer had been programmed
to put the protection

706
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:58,645
of the city above all else.

707
00:52:58,712 --> 00:53:01,615
In its damaged state, it mistook
the unfamiliar violence

708
00:53:01,682 --> 00:53:04,484
of the people as that of enemies
and killed many of them.

709
00:53:04,551 --> 00:53:05,786
The rest ran away.

710
00:53:07,554 --> 00:53:10,324
I've asked you here because
I have a request to make.

711
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:12,292
On the behalf of many
Mr. Simpsons

712
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:13,560
and Lisas who remain.

713
00:53:14,962 --> 00:53:16,330
Stay here with us.

714
00:53:16,396 --> 00:53:19,099
You can see how well
the computer cares for us.

715
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:23,203
The average lifespan here
is no less than 104 years.

716
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:25,506
If you live beyond that,
we can still promise you

717
00:53:25,572 --> 00:53:26,740
a comfortable life.

718
00:53:27,841 --> 00:53:30,777
We can also guarantee your
protection from the many dangers

719
00:53:30,844 --> 00:53:32,346
in the outside world.

720
00:53:32,412 --> 00:53:35,449
All your worries will be solved
for you by the computer.

721
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:37,084
What do you say?

722
00:53:37,651 --> 00:53:40,120
You mean, that you're inviting
us both to become members

723
00:53:40,187 --> 00:53:42,623
of the cast of this charade
which you play eternally?

724
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:45,592
It's not a charade.
It's our reality.

725
00:53:46,426 --> 00:53:49,363
And don't forget that this is
now the only place in the world

726
00:53:49,429 --> 00:53:52,065
where a human being,
thanks to the computer,

727
00:53:52,132 --> 00:53:53,934
can live with human dignity.

728
00:53:54,001 --> 00:53:56,136
Outside there is only ruin.

729
00:53:56,203 --> 00:53:58,572
Humans are reduced to the level
of beasts.

730
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:00,941
The strong devour the weak.

731
00:54:01,308 --> 00:54:03,186
I can't believe that you
would willingly go back

732
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:04,611
to such a situation.

733
00:54:05,212 --> 00:54:08,081
Think logically about it
and you'll realize I'm right.

734
00:54:08,148 --> 00:54:09,783
Which do you find
more desirable?

735
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:12,819
The idyllic life in our city,
which I described?

736
00:54:12,886 --> 00:54:15,689
Or the fear and violence
which have become the main?

737
00:54:15,756 --> 00:54:18,091
Virtually, the only
characteristics of life

738
00:54:18,158 --> 00:54:19,159
out there.

739
00:54:20,394 --> 00:54:21,862
So I'll ask you again.

740
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:23,797
Will you accept our invitation
to stay with us?

741
00:54:24,531 --> 00:54:28,202
No, I won't. You aren't right.
I'm not sure how to say it,

742
00:54:28,268 --> 00:54:30,580
but something is missing from
your description of life here

743
00:54:30,604 --> 00:54:31,705
and on the outside.

744
00:54:31,772 --> 00:54:33,049
You're prisoners.
You're prisoners

745
00:54:33,073 --> 00:54:34,208
of thousands of memories.

746
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:35,542
If that's your feeling.

747
00:54:36,043 --> 00:54:38,045
I'd hoped you would
cooperate freely.

748
00:54:43,116 --> 00:54:46,486
I see now that you've been too
brutalized by your experiences

749
00:54:46,553 --> 00:54:48,188
to appreciate my offer.

750
00:54:48,255 --> 00:54:50,123
But at least I gave
you the chance.

751
00:54:51,892 --> 00:54:54,161
And you, young lady.
Would you consider remaining?

752
00:54:56,496 --> 00:54:58,565
Behind your reasonable exterior,

753
00:54:58,632 --> 00:55:00,601
you, too, resort to force
in the end.

754
00:55:03,871 --> 00:55:04,938
[electricity crackles]

755
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,308
[explosion]

756
00:55:11,011 --> 00:55:13,180
But your city will one day
turn to dust

757
00:55:13,247 --> 00:55:15,916
and your supercomputer is
powerless to avert its fate.

758
00:55:15,983 --> 00:55:18,785
We'll see.
You talk as though you were god.

759
00:55:21,154 --> 00:55:24,491
I have certain knowledge,
but that does not make me god.

760
00:55:24,558 --> 00:55:26,393
Nor believe me, does it make
me your enemy.

761
00:55:27,127 --> 00:55:29,563
But I shan't submit to the will
of your supercomputer.

762
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:31,431
Not even in exchange for peace.

763
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:33,200
That would deny the being I am.

764
00:55:34,101 --> 00:55:36,737
Wataru. You know what I mean?

765
00:55:36,803 --> 00:55:38,972
Yes, and I agree.

766
00:55:39,406 --> 00:55:41,742
Dare you allow me to talk
with the real Lisa,

767
00:55:41,808 --> 00:55:43,577
as well as the real Mr. Simpson?

768
00:55:44,778 --> 00:55:47,881
Yes, we'll see them,
and hear what they say.

769
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:50,884
We aren't afraid.

770
00:56:19,813 --> 00:56:21,582
[Wataru] Listen to me, Lisa.

771
00:56:21,648 --> 00:56:24,718
What I say to you isn't
dictated by your computer.

772
00:56:24,785 --> 00:56:25,786
Look there.

773
00:56:26,753 --> 00:56:28,722
Thousands of people lived
in this city

774
00:56:28,789 --> 00:56:30,524
when the wind blew across it.

775
00:56:30,591 --> 00:56:33,594
One they lost their memories
and longer behaved rationally,

776
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:36,029
the computer feared they would
destroy the city,

777
00:56:36,096 --> 00:56:37,197
and killed them.

778
00:56:38,031 --> 00:56:40,200
Those who weren't killed fled,
or died anyway.

779
00:56:40,267 --> 00:56:42,402
Your computer had had the
ability to repair

780
00:56:42,469 --> 00:56:43,604
itself built into it.

781
00:56:44,938 --> 00:56:47,074
When it started operating
properly again,

782
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:49,510
it found that instead of a city
full of people

783
00:56:49,576 --> 00:56:51,345
it had been programmed
to care for,

784
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:53,714
the real Mr. Simpson and you,

785
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,950
it needed those other people
to satisfy its program.

786
00:56:57,017 --> 00:56:59,520
So it reawakened their memories
in you.

787
00:57:00,988 --> 00:57:03,991
I remember now. My god.

788
00:57:04,057 --> 00:57:06,260
The terrible weight of all
those memories.

789
00:57:06,326 --> 00:57:08,128
You can put all that behind you.

790
00:57:08,195 --> 00:57:09,563
Come with us.

791
00:57:10,163 --> 00:57:11,632
With Sophia and me.

792
00:57:11,698 --> 00:57:14,101
You'll be free to go on
with a life of your own,

793
00:57:14,168 --> 00:57:16,036
instead of being a puppet
of the computer.

794
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:19,540
You can speak with your own
voice, see with your own eyes.

795
00:57:25,712 --> 00:57:28,549
[Sophia] You have to find
words. Your own words.

796
00:57:29,416 --> 00:57:31,485
Tell them how exciting
the journey will be.

797
00:57:32,286 --> 00:57:34,354
The flame of a sunset
in Arizona.

798
00:57:36,089 --> 00:57:38,525
The majestic power
of Niagara Falls

799
00:57:38,592 --> 00:57:40,060
taking their awesome drop.

800
00:57:42,162 --> 00:57:44,665
The sweet scents of apple
blossom time.

801
00:57:45,232 --> 00:57:47,801
The burning heat
of summer plains.

802
00:57:48,268 --> 00:57:51,104
The snowy chill
of mountain peaks.

803
00:57:51,972 --> 00:57:54,842
You must persuade them these
are still wonderful things

804
00:57:54,908 --> 00:57:55,909

but when you broke free
of the earth's gravity,

Will you return our memories?

[Sophia] I don't know.

982
01:15:18,886 --> 01:15:21,288
Is it better for man to have
memories or not?

983
01:15:22,322 --> 01:15:24,258
Is there more pain in them
or less?

Are they more violent or less?

[Wataru] How will you decide?

986
01:15:28,428 --> 01:15:29,663
[Sophia] It's not my decision.

987
01:15:30,898 --> 01:15:34,635
I'll tell them what I've seen
here, and about you.

Then it'll be decided.

[Johnny] Let's see now.

Maybe I'll call you Wataru.

994
01:16:06,066 --> 01:16:07,267
[Wataru] What does that mean?

995
01:16:07,334 --> 01:16:09,636
It's a Japanese word
that means traveler.

996
01:16:09,703 --> 01:16:11,071
That's what you're going to be.

And wherever you go, you will
teach men what you've forgotten.

That's right.

You can make music with that.
