Is that a lighthouse?

00:00:16.784 --> 00:00:19.119 position:16% line:83% align:start
[NAMI] Yeah, it's one of
the guideposts.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:22.422 position:10% line:83% align:start
So the entrance to the Grand

Okay. Before we go,

00:00:29.664 --> 00:00:32.499 position:19% line:83% align:start
I think we oughta have
a quick launching ceremony!

I'll become King of the Pirates!

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:43.611 position:24% line:83% align:start
To be the world's
best swordsman.

00:00:43.645 --> 00:00:46.514 position:16% line:83% align:start
And I'm gonna draw a map

in on this, too!

This is a small seaport village.

For the past year or so,

a pirate ship has been
anchored at the port.

if I've ever heard one.

you could ever be a pirate!

I don't fall overboard!

a sour mood, kiddo!

You're still young,
you should be having fun!

more fun than anything!

teach him that kind of thing.

we can take him on

what's the harm?

I'm just sayin',
you're much too young

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:25.740 position:7% line:89% align:start
to try and strike out to sea.

00:03:25.773 --> 00:03:27.374 position:30% line:83% align:start
You can ask me
about it in ten years,

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:28.609 position:13% line:89% align:start
and maybe I'll reconsider.

00:03:28.643 --> 00:03:31.512 position:30% line:83% align:start
Stupid Shanks!
I'm not that little!

00:03:31.546 --> 00:03:34.247 position:27% line:83% align:start
Jeez. Calm down.
Drink some juice, kid.

00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:37.484 position:21% line:89% align:start
Ha! Yay, thank you!

00:03:37.518 --> 00:03:39.419 position:24% line:83% align:start
Real pirates don't
drink juice, big guy!

[BECKMAN]
Luffy.

00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:47.662 position:7% line:83% align:start
You have to try to understand
how the boss feels.

00:03:47.695 --> 00:03:49.597 position:27% line:89% align:start
Mr. First Mate!

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.298 position:27% line:83% align:start
Think about it.
This guy is the captain

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:53.034 position:5% line:89% align:start
of a tough-as-nails pirate crew.

00:03:53.067 --> 00:03:54.602 position:7% line:89% align:start
So he knows more than anybody

00:03:54.635 --> 00:03:57.038 position:24% line:83% align:start
how dangerous this
kind of life can be.

00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:59.707 position:16% line:83% align:start
My point is, he told you
not to come along with us

00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:01.776 position:19% line:83% align:start
because he didn't want
to break your spirit.

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:02.944 position:24% line:89% align:start
You don't get it!

00:04:02.977 --> 00:04:06.413 position:13% line:83% align:start

'cause he thinks I'm a kid!

You see?

00:04:08.716 --> 00:04:10.685 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're having fun as always.

00:04:10.718 --> 00:04:14.789 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yeah. I get such a kick out of
giving this kid a hard time.

00:04:14.822 --> 00:04:18.059 position:16% line:83% align:start
Luffy. Would you like to
order some food, too?

00:04:18.092 --> 00:04:20.293 position:5% line:89% align:start
Put it on my treasure tab, 'kay?

00:04:20.327 --> 00:04:21.796 position:16% line:89% align:start
The treasure tab again?

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.965 position:24% line:83% align:start
You know that does
qualify as stealing.

00:04:23.998 --> 00:04:25.099 position:38% line:89% align:start
Nuh-uh!

00:04:25.133 --> 00:04:27.034 position:13% line:83% align:start
Once I become a pirate and
find a bunch of treasure,

00:04:27.068 --> 00:04:29.537 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna pay back
every last bit!

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.972 position:27% line:89% align:start
I know you will.

00:04:35.042 --> 00:04:37.477 position:16% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] How much longer
are you gonna be here for?

00:04:37.512 --> 00:04:40.380 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm not too sure. I believe
the plan we decided on

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:41.849 position:30% line:83% align:start
was to go on a
couple more voyages

00:04:41.883 --> 00:04:44.786 position:5% line:83% align:start
then head out towards the north
after we're done with that.

00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:49.557 position:7% line:89% align:start
Only a couple more trips, huh?

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.658 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:52.126 --> 00:04:55.096 position:10% line:83% align:start
Okay, then I can practice my
swimming while you're here!

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:57.999 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHANKS] That's a good idea.
Knock yourself out.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.605 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HIGUMA]
Excuse us.

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.941 position:24% line:83% align:start
So these are what
pass for pirates here?

00:05:06.974 --> 00:05:09.476 position:16% line:89% align:start
Looks awfully sad to me.

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:20.420 position:5% line:89% align:start
You see, we're mountain bandits.

00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:23.558 position:16% line:83% align:start
But we didn't come here
to tear your place apart.

00:05:23.591 --> 00:05:24.926 position:10% line:89% align:start
We'll just take some booze.

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:26.794 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm so sorry, sir,
but we're actually

fresh out of alcohol
for the moment.

00:05:28.863 --> 00:05:32.399 position:13% line:83% align:start
[HIGUMA] Hm? Those pirates
seem to be drinking, though.

'Zat water?

00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:37.505 position:7% line:83% align:start
[MAKINO] No, that was the last
bit of what I had stocked up.

00:05:37.538 --> 00:05:39.472 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, this is a
problem, isn't it?

00:05:39.507 --> 00:05:41.609 position:16% line:83% align:start
It looks like my friends
and I drank the place dry

00:05:41.642 --> 00:05:44.846 position:21% line:83% align:start
before you gentlemen
came in. Sorry.

Well, now that you've
drawn your pistol,

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.458 position:5% line:89% align:start
do you plan to actually use it?

What I'm trying to
tell you is that guns

aren't for making threats,
they're made for actions.

you're dealin' with here?

In case it wasn't obvious,

00:12:35.322 --> 00:12:37.825 position:7% line:83% align:start
you fellas have picked a fight
with a crew of pirates.

laugh it off and forget it.

your reasoning may be,

00:16:36.196 --> 00:16:39.433 position:7% line:83% align:start
[NARRATOR] Luffy learned many
important things that day:

00:16:39.466 --> 00:16:42.770 position:13% line:83% align:start
the harshness of the sea,
his own powerlessness,

00:16:42.804 --> 00:16:44.539 position:19% line:89% align:start
and most importantly,

00:16:44.572 --> 00:16:47.642 position:27% line:83% align:start
the greatness of
the man called Shanks.

00:16:47.675 --> 00:16:51.178 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's when young Luffy
resolved with all his heart

00:16:51.211 --> 00:16:53.548 position:13% line:89% align:start
he would become like him.

00:16:55.215 --> 00:16:56.283 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Shanks.

00:16:56.316 --> 00:16:58.352 position:16% line:83% align:start
Are you really about to
leave the village for good?

00:16:58.385 --> 00:17:01.255 position:19% line:83% align:start
Uh-huh. Yep, it's time
for us to part ways.

00:17:01.288 --> 00:17:03.390 position:7% line:89% align:start

00:17:03.423 --> 00:17:04.324 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:17:04.358 --> 00:17:06.561 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I'm not gonna
beg to come with you,

00:17:06.594 --> 00:17:09.831 position:16% line:83% align:start
'cause I'm gonna become
a pirate all on my own!

00:17:09.864 --> 00:17:12.734 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's good, because I wouldn't
bring you with me anyways.

00:17:12.767 --> 00:17:15.537 position:21% line:83% align:start
I mean you'll never
make it as a pirate, kiddo!

00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:17.672 position:7% line:89% align:start
Will, too! Just wait and see!

00:17:17.705 --> 00:17:20.608 position:10% line:83% align:start

every bit as good as yours,

00:17:20.642 --> 00:17:23.443 position:13% line:83% align:start
and we'll find the world's
greatest treasure.

00:17:23.477 --> 00:17:27.080 position:27% line:83% align:start
And I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:17:27.114 --> 00:17:31.151 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh? Planning to
outdo me, are ya?

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.054 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:17:37.257 --> 00:17:40.294 position:21% line:83% align:start
If that's the case,
I'll leave this here.

00:17:46.601 --> 00:17:49.236 position:24% line:83% align:start

more to me than anything.

I have a goal of my own.

00:26:07.134 --> 00:26:08.069 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:26:08.102 --> 00:26:10.838 position:19% line:83% align:start
I plan to be the best
swordsman there is.

00:26:10.871 --> 00:26:13.707 position:19% line:83% align:start
At this point, even if
it's for criminal deeds,

00:26:13.741 --> 00:26:16.777 position:16% line:83% align:start
I still want the entire
world to know my name!

00:26:16.811 --> 00:26:18.679 position:16% line:89% align:start
You asked me to do this,

00:26:18.712 --> 00:26:21.115 position:16% line:83% align:start
so if joining your crew
costs me my dream,

00:26:21.148 --> 00:26:24.085 position:21% line:83% align:start
you'd better accept
responsibility for it!

00:26:24.118 --> 00:26:26.120 position:19% line:83% align:start
You'll be the greatest
swordsman ever, huh?

00:26:26.153 --> 00:26:28.355 position:7% line:83% align:start
Good, the King of the Pirates
expects nothing less

00:26:28.389 --> 00:26:30.791 position:24% line:83% align:start
than the best of a
member of his crew!

00:26:30.825 --> 00:26:32.927 position:24% line:89% align:start
Heh. You talk big.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.795 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MORGAN]
Still standing around?

00:26:34.829 --> 00:26:36.764 position:27% line:83% align:start
Slaughter those
two rats at once!

00:26:36.797 --> 00:26:37.998 position:27% line:89% align:start
Watch out, Zoro!

00:26:38.032 --> 00:26:40.201 position:21% line:89% align:start
Now Gum-Gum... Whip!

00:26:40.234 --> 00:26:42.103 position:27% line:89% align:start
[MARINES groan]

00:26:42.136 --> 00:26:44.405 position:19% line:89% align:start
What the hell are you?

00:26:44.438 --> 00:26:45.706 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HELMEPPO]
Yoohoo!

00:26:45.739 --> 00:26:46.774 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:26:46.807 --> 00:26:50.111 position:7% line:83% align:start
If you value this boy's life,
you'll surrender!

00:26:50.144 --> 00:26:51.879 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

00:26:51.912 --> 00:26:53.781 position:24% line:89% align:start
Are you listening?

00:26:54.815 --> 00:26:57.718 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're disrespecting a Captain!

00:26:57.751 --> 00:26:59.987 position:35% line:89% align:start
...Pistol!

00:27:00.921 --> 00:27:02.990 position:24% line:89% align:start
Aw yeah! Nice one!

00:27:03.023 --> 00:27:04.992 position:27% line:89% align:start
[MORGAN groans]

00:27:05.025 --> 00:27:08.195 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
Well, Captain. That was fun.

00:27:08.229 --> 00:27:09.897 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Bye!

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:11.398 position:35% line:83% align:start
[NARRATOR]
After escaping his death,

00:27:11.432 --> 00:27:14.735 position:13% line:83% align:start
Zoro accompanied Luffy on
an adventure and witnessed

00:27:14.768 --> 00:27:18.372 position:16% line:83% align:start
an unbelievable scene at
the sea restaurant Baratie.

00:27:22.443 --> 00:27:26.947 position:10% line:89% align:start
[BARATIE PIRATES screaming]

00:27:28.048 --> 00:27:30.684 position:10% line:83% align:start
[NARRATOR] They were greeted
by the man known far and wide

00:27:30.718 --> 00:27:32.720 position:30% line:83% align:start
as the world's
strongest swordsman.

00:27:32.753 --> 00:27:34.722 position:24% line:89% align:start
"Hawk-Eye Mihawk."

00:27:34.755 --> 00:27:37.324 position:21% line:89% align:start
No way. It can't be.

00:27:38.259 --> 00:27:40.261 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
Is that really him?

00:27:43.097 --> 00:27:44.398 position:13% line:83% align:start
[BARATIE PIRATE B] Dammit,
what kind of awful grudge

00:27:44.431 --> 00:27:47.801 position:27% line:83% align:start
must you have to
attack us like this?

00:27:47.835 --> 00:27:49.403 position:24% line:89% align:start
Just killing time.

00:27:49.436 --> 00:27:52.072 position:16% line:89% align:start
[BARATIE PIRATE C yells]

00:27:56.377 --> 00:27:58.212 position:21% line:89% align:start
What? How'd he miss?

00:27:58.245 --> 00:27:59.813 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
Mihawk is skilled.

00:27:59.847 --> 00:28:02.416 position:7% line:83% align:start
He used the point of his blade
to redirect the bullets.

00:28:02.449 --> 00:28:05.853 position:27% line:83% align:start
I've never seen
such swift movement.

00:28:05.886 --> 00:28:08.989 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's much more to
swordplay than simply force.

00:28:09.023 --> 00:28:11.959 position:7% line:83% align:start
[ZORO] Did you use that sword
to slice up the ship?

00:28:11.992 --> 00:28:12.927 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MIHAWK]
Indeed.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.128 position:27% line:89% align:start
No doubt, then.

00:28:14.161 --> 00:28:16.363 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're the strongest.

00:28:16.397 --> 00:28:19.733 position:24% line:83% align:start
I went out to sea
so I could meet you.

00:28:19.767 --> 00:28:21.368 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MIHAWK]
What's your goal?

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:25.005 position:27% line:89% align:start
To surpass you.

00:28:25.039 --> 00:28:26.473 position:16% line:89% align:start
You've got time, right?

00:28:26.508 --> 00:28:29.009 position:24% line:89% align:start
Let's have a duel.

00:28:29.043 --> 00:28:31.946 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MIHAWK]
You're so weak. It's pitiful.

00:28:33.781 --> 00:28:35.049 position:35% line:83% align:start
[MIHAWK]
If you were a decent swordsman,

00:28:35.082 --> 00:28:37.418 position:16% line:83% align:start
you'd be able to see the
disparity in our abilities

00:28:37.451 --> 00:28:39.887 position:5% line:89% align:start
before we even drew our weapons.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.089 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's either extreme courage
or extreme ignorance

00:28:42.122 --> 00:28:44.225 position:7% line:89% align:start
that inspires you to fight me.

00:28:44.258 --> 00:28:46.493 position:30% line:83% align:start
Which of those
would you say it is?

00:28:46.528 --> 00:28:49.964 position:5% line:89% align:start
Neither, it's extreme ambition.

00:28:49.997 --> 00:28:53.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
And because I made a
promise to a good friend!

00:28:57.871 --> 00:29:00.441 position:16% line:83% align:start
Wait, are you seriously
gonna use that?

00:29:00.474 --> 00:29:03.010 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm not the kind of beast
who uses all of his might

00:29:03.043 --> 00:29:04.546 position:5% line:89% align:start
when he's hunting down a rabbit.

00:29:04.579 --> 00:29:06.880 position:30% line:83% align:start
Unfortunately,
this is the smallest blade

00:29:06.914 --> 00:29:09.116 position:16% line:89% align:start
I have on me right now.

00:29:09.149 --> 00:29:11.885 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna make you
regret those words!

00:29:11.919 --> 00:29:13.220 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MIHAWK]
You're like a frog in a well

00:29:13.254 --> 00:29:16.056 position:24% line:83% align:start
who can't see how
vast the world is.

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:18.993 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
Oni... Giri!

00:29:24.865 --> 00:29:26.867 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
I can't move!

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.202 position:19% line:89% align:start
How is that possible?

00:29:28.235 --> 00:29:30.971 position:24% line:83% align:start
No one's ever seen
through this technique!

00:29:31.005 --> 00:29:33.807 position:10% line:89% align:start
No. This can't be happening!

00:29:33.841 --> 00:29:35.409 position:24% line:89% align:start
I know he's good,

00:29:35.442 --> 00:29:39.346 position:10% line:83% align:start
but there's no way that he's
that much better than I am!

00:29:40.347 --> 00:29:41.382 position:38% line:89% align:start
[yells]

00:29:41.415 --> 00:29:44.351 position:13% line:83% align:start
[ZORO] I can't be this far
from becoming the best!

00:29:51.158 --> 00:29:53.294 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
I refuse to believe that!

00:29:53.327 --> 00:29:55.162 position:13% line:89% align:start
This is too much of a gap!

00:29:55.195 --> 00:29:57.131 position:30% line:89% align:start
[ZORO grunts]

00:29:57.965 --> 00:30:01.569 position:5% line:83% align:start
[ZORO] I didn't devote my entire
life to studying swordsmanship

00:30:01.603 --> 00:30:05.239 position:7% line:83% align:start
just to be outdone by a stupid
little toy knife like that!

00:30:05.272 --> 00:30:08.075 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're certainly ferocious,
I'll give you that.

00:30:11.378 --> 00:30:14.014 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
I have to win this fight.

00:30:14.048 --> 00:30:15.916 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
Whether me or you, someday,

00:30:15.949 --> 00:30:18.520 position:10% line:83% align:start
one of us'll be the world's
greatest swordsman!

00:30:18.553 --> 00:30:21.322 position:16% line:83% align:start
[ZORO] All that matters
right now is defeating him!

00:30:21.355 --> 00:30:24.391 position:13% line:83% align:start
And then my name'll reach
all the way to the heavens!

00:30:24.425 --> 00:30:28.495 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna get stronger for
myself, and for Kuina, too!

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:30.998 position:21% line:89% align:start
What is your burden?

00:30:31.031 --> 00:30:33.434 position:27% line:83% align:start
For what do you
wish to gain power?

00:30:33.467 --> 00:30:34.968 position:24% line:89% align:start
Tell me, weak one.

00:30:35.002 --> 00:30:36.136 position:33% line:89% align:start
[ZORO gasps]

00:30:40.542 --> 00:30:42.076 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
Tiger...

00:30:42.109 --> 00:30:44.512 position:19% line:83% align:start
You'll be the greatest
swordsman ever, huh?

00:30:44.546 --> 00:30:46.947 position:7% line:83% align:start
Good, the King of the Pirates
expects nothing less

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.483 position:24% line:83% align:start
than the best for
a member of his crew!

00:30:49.517 --> 00:30:51.418 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
...Trap!

00:31:11.305 --> 00:31:13.941 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MIHAWK] You're going to
let me pierce your heart?

00:31:13.974 --> 00:31:15.943 position:24% line:89% align:start
Why not withdraw?

00:31:15.976 --> 00:31:22.049 position:13% line:83% align:start
[ZORO] I don't know why.
But if I pull back even a step,

00:31:22.082 --> 00:31:24.385 position:7% line:83% align:start
I feel like all the important
pledges and promises

00:31:24.418 --> 00:31:26.387 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've made in life
will be shattered.

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:29.289 position:7% line:89% align:start
And if I allow that to happen,

00:31:29.323 --> 00:31:34.529 position:5% line:83% align:start
then I'll never be able to find
my way back to where I am now.

00:31:34.562 --> 00:31:37.431 position:24% line:83% align:start
Of course. That's
what defeat means.

00:31:37.464 --> 00:31:41.268 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're right. All the more
reason I can't quit then.

00:31:41.301 --> 00:31:43.470 position:27% line:89% align:start
What if you die?

00:31:43.505 --> 00:31:45.673 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's better than giving up.

00:31:46.473 --> 00:31:48.942 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MIHAWK]
Choosing death over defeat.

00:31:48.976 --> 00:31:51.412 position:10% line:89% align:start
He's quite strong of heart.

00:31:51.445 --> 00:31:55.082 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MIHAWK]
Young man. Tell me your name.

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:59.153 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
Roronoa Zoro!

00:32:00.154 --> 00:32:01.355 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll remember it.

00:32:01.388 --> 00:32:04.124 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's rare to see
resolve such as yours.

00:32:04.158 --> 00:32:06.728 position:24% line:83% align:start
Therefore, out of
swordsman's honor,

00:32:06.761 --> 00:32:10.665 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'll exchange my knife for the
world's deadliest Black Blade.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.103 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
So, this'll be the last hit.

00:32:16.136 --> 00:32:18.506 position:30% line:83% align:start
This fight can
only end two ways.

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:22.309 position:27% line:83% align:start
I become best in
the world, or I die.

00:32:27.715 --> 00:32:29.249 position:35% line:89% align:start
Farewell!

[ZORO]
He got me. I lost.

00:32:49.102 --> 00:32:52.339 position:27% line:83% align:start
Somehow, I never
imagined that I would.

00:32:53.641 --> 00:32:55.342 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
I see.

00:32:55.375 --> 00:32:58.746 position:16% line:83% align:start
This is the power of the
best swordsman there is.

00:33:02.049 --> 00:33:03.585 position:27% line:89% align:start
What are you--?

00:33:03.618 --> 00:33:07.154 position:7% line:83% align:start
I can't have scars on my back,
that would be a mark of shame.

00:33:07.187 --> 00:33:08.723 position:35% line:89% align:start
How noble.

00:33:13.628 --> 00:33:15.797 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MIHAWK]
Don't live too fast.

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:18.198 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let this be a lesson.

00:33:19.366 --> 00:33:22.670 position:35% line:89% align:start

I am Dracule Mihawk, and it's
far too early for you to die.

00:33:33.681 --> 00:33:36.083 position:21% line:83% align:start
Learn about yourself
and the world around you.

00:33:36.116 --> 00:33:39.253 position:5% line:89% align:start
Increase your strength, Roronoa!

00:33:39.286 --> 00:33:41.221 position:24% line:83% align:start
No matter how many
years it takes,

00:33:41.255 --> 00:33:45.125 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll wait for you to come
take this title from me!

00:33:45.158 --> 00:33:46.594 position:13% line:89% align:start
Defeat my sword in battle

00:33:46.628 --> 00:33:49.463 position:19% line:83% align:start
with the raging mettle
of your spirit!

00:33:49.496 --> 00:33:51.298 position:19% line:89% align:start
Become better than me!

00:33:51.331 --> 00:33:53.267 position:33% line:89% align:start
You have to!

00:33:59.641 --> 00:34:01.609 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Zoro?

00:34:01.643 --> 00:34:03.043 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
Luffy!

00:34:04.177 --> 00:34:06.514 position:10% line:89% align:start
I guess I worried you there.

00:34:06.548 --> 00:34:08.583 position:19% line:83% align:start
But hey, you'll accept
nothing less than

00:34:08.616 --> 00:34:11.184 position:24% line:83% align:start
the best swordsman
there is, right?

00:34:11.218 --> 00:34:14.722 position:7% line:89% align:start
So I won't let you down. I...

00:34:16.591 --> 00:34:18.860 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
I give my word!

00:34:18.893 --> 00:34:22.429 position:24% line:83% align:start
I won't let myself
be beaten again!

00:34:22.462 --> 00:34:26.634 position:10% line:83% align:start
Until the day I can dethrone
Hawk-Eye as number one.

00:34:26.668 --> 00:34:28.836 position:30% line:89% align:start
Mark my words.

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:31.873 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll never be defeated!

00:34:31.906 --> 00:34:36.376 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is that all right,
King of the Pirates?

00:34:39.313 --> 00:34:41.549 position:30% line:89% align:start
[laughs] Yup!

00:34:52.927 --> 00:34:56.229 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hey wait, let me
in on this, too!

00:34:56.263 --> 00:34:59.734 position:24% line:5% align:start
My goal is to be a
brave warrior of the sea!

00:35:01.234 --> 00:35:03.203 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
Help! Sound the alarm!

00:35:03.236 --> 00:35:04.271 position:30% line:89% align:start
They're here!

00:35:04.304 --> 00:35:07.474 position:16% line:83% align:start
Pirates are in town and
they're gonna kill us all!

00:35:07.508 --> 00:35:10.578 position:19% line:83% align:start
Pirates are attacking
our village!

00:35:10.612 --> 00:35:13.815 position:7% line:83% align:start
Everybody get out of here now,
before it's too late!

00:35:13.848 --> 00:35:15.349 position:16% line:89% align:start
There are pirates here?

00:35:15.382 --> 00:35:17.417 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, looks like it's
time to start work.

00:35:17.451 --> 00:35:19.654 position:13% line:89% align:start
That guy's so persistent.

00:35:19.687 --> 00:35:22.924 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's a lie! [laughs]

00:35:22.957 --> 00:35:25.225 position:13% line:89% align:start
I just fooled all of you!

00:35:25.258 --> 00:35:26.159 position:38% line:89% align:start

You little liar!

00:35:28.295 --> 00:35:30.297 position:33% line:83% align:start
[TOWNSMAN D]
Get back here!

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:32.265 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
Oops, here they come!

00:35:32.299 --> 00:35:37.170 position:7% line:89% align:start
[laughs] Catch me if you can!

00:35:37.204 --> 00:35:40.173 position:33% line:83% align:start
[TOWNSMAN E]
Dammit! Where did he go?

00:35:40.207 --> 00:35:42.910 position:24% line:83% align:start
[USOPP] All right,
another job well done!

00:35:42.944 --> 00:35:44.746 position:19% line:83% align:start
Somebody's gotta bring
a little excitement

00:35:44.779 --> 00:35:47.347 position:27% line:83% align:start
into this sleepy
village, after all!

00:35:47.381 --> 00:35:50.718 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now then, time to go
pay my friend a visit!

00:35:51.786 --> 00:35:53.821 position:30% line:89% align:start
Um, Klahadore?

00:35:53.855 --> 00:35:55.923 position:33% line:83% align:start
[KLAHADORE]
What's on your mind, Miss Kaya?

00:35:55.957 --> 00:35:58.425 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAYA]
I want to see Usopp again.

00:35:58.458 --> 00:36:00.227 position:21% line:89% align:start
Him? No. That man is

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.530 position:10% line:83% align:start
the most dreadful teller of
tall tales in the village!

00:36:02.563 --> 00:36:03.564 position:38% line:89% align:start
Killjoy.

00:36:03.598 --> 00:36:07.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
Say what you will.
I'm not letting you see him!

00:36:09.504 --> 00:36:10.838 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:36:12.339 --> 00:36:12.974 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:36:13.007 --> 00:36:14.642 position:21% line:89% align:start
Usopp, you're here!

00:36:14.676 --> 00:36:16.844 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
You seem pretty down today.

00:36:16.878 --> 00:36:18.278 position:30% line:89% align:start
I guess I am.

00:36:18.311 --> 00:36:20.347 position:16% line:83% align:start
I want to ask you inside
like a real guest,

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:21.582 position:10% line:89% align:start
but Klahadore would refuse.

00:36:21.616 --> 00:36:24.619 position:10% line:83% align:start
[USOPP] Aw, don't sweat it,
this is better for me, anyway.

00:36:24.652 --> 00:36:25.987 position:24% line:89% align:start
I like it outside.

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.422 position:24% line:83% align:start
'Cause I'm a brave
warrior of the sea!

00:36:28.455 --> 00:36:30.558 position:30% line:83% align:start
[KAYA giggles]
That does make sense.

00:36:30.591 --> 00:36:32.593 position:24% line:83% align:start
What story are you
going to tell me today?

00:36:32.627 --> 00:36:34.494 position:16% line:83% align:start
I dunno, I was thinking
it might be fun

00:36:34.529 --> 00:36:35.596 position:13% line:89% align:start
to tell you about the time

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:38.666 position:19% line:83% align:start
I had to fight a giant
goldfish at the South Pole!

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:41.703 position:19% line:83% align:start
The craziest part was
how enormous its poop was!

00:36:41.736 --> 00:36:45.405 position:7% line:83% align:start
When I fell and landed on it,
I thought I was on solid ground!

00:36:45.439 --> 00:36:46.974 position:27% line:89% align:start
[KAYA laughing]

00:36:47.008 --> 00:36:48.743 position:21% line:89% align:start
He's doing it again.

00:36:48.776 --> 00:36:50.377 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NINJIN]
The captain's so nice.

00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:52.013 position:16% line:83% align:start
He comes over every day
to make her laugh

00:36:52.046 --> 00:36:54.481 position:27% line:83% align:start
to these special
made-up stories.

00:36:54.515 --> 00:36:55.516 position:24% line:89% align:start
[USOPP chuckling]

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:57.752 position:35% line:83% align:start
[TAMANEGI]
Captain! Captain!

00:36:57.785 --> 00:36:59.520 position:13% line:89% align:start
I found out something bad!

00:36:59.554 --> 00:37:02.389 position:16% line:83% align:start
Pirates! They're getting
ready to attack us!

00:37:02.422 --> 00:37:04.491 position:27% line:89% align:start
Huh? No kidding.

00:37:04.525 --> 00:37:05.492 position:35% line:83% align:start
[TAMANEGI]
It's true!

00:37:05.526 --> 00:37:07.595 position:19% line:83% align:start
There're three of 'em,
what are we gonna do?

00:37:07.628 --> 00:37:08.863 position:27% line:89% align:start
Only three, huh?

00:37:08.896 --> 00:37:09.864 position:35% line:83% align:start
[TAMANEGI]
Yes!

00:37:09.897 --> 00:37:15.770 position:19% line:83% align:start
Sweet! Then let's save
the day, Usopp Pirates!

00:37:15.803 --> 00:37:17.538 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
Let's see.

00:37:18.606 --> 00:37:19.807 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
Is that them?

00:37:19.841 --> 00:37:21.876 position:38% line:83% align:start
[PIIMAN]
They don't seem very scary.

00:37:21.909 --> 00:37:24.377 position:10% line:83% align:start
[TAMANEGI] But look, they've
got a skull on their flag!

00:37:24.411 --> 00:37:25.412 position:33% line:89% align:start
He sees us!

00:37:25.445 --> 00:37:26.547 position:30% line:89% align:start
[KIDS scream]

00:37:26.581 --> 00:37:27.715 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't leave me!

00:37:27.749 --> 00:37:28.583 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Hm?

00:37:28.616 --> 00:37:30.518 position:30% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Uh-oh!

00:37:32.053 --> 00:37:34.488 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm Captain Usopp,
leader of the fearsome pirates

00:37:34.522 --> 00:37:36.323 position:10% line:89% align:start
who reign over this village.

00:37:36.356 --> 00:37:37.892 position:10% line:89% align:start
You'd best watch your back!

00:37:37.925 --> 00:37:40.393 position:21% line:83% align:start
And don't even think
about attacking us!

00:37:40.427 --> 00:37:42.997 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm the commander of
an army of 8,000 men,

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:44.799 position:10% line:89% align:start
and all of them are killers!

00:37:44.832 --> 00:37:45.733 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's a lie.

00:37:45.767 --> 00:37:47.434 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
How'd she know?

00:37:47.467 --> 00:37:50.437 position:30% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY laughs]
Man, this guy's funny!

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:54.407 position:27% line:89% align:start
[LUFFY laughing]

00:37:54.441 --> 00:37:56.844 position:13% line:83% align:start
[USOPP] You're looking for
crewmates and a ship, huh?

00:37:56.878 --> 00:37:58.880 position:27% line:83% align:start
That sounds like
a big adventure!

00:37:58.913 --> 00:38:00.148 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yup, that's right.

00:38:00.181 --> 00:38:03.551 position:5% line:83% align:start
Kaya's the only one around here
who can wrangle a ship for you.

00:38:03.584 --> 00:38:04.719 position:41% line:89% align:start
Kaya?

00:38:04.752 --> 00:38:07.989 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah. She's a sickly girl
who has to stay in her bed.

00:38:08.022 --> 00:38:10.591 position:19% line:83% align:start
Her parents both died
from an illness.

00:38:10.625 --> 00:38:12.660 position:13% line:83% align:start
After that, she inherited
a whole lotta money

00:38:12.693 --> 00:38:14.427 position:13% line:89% align:start
and a giant mansion, too.

00:38:14.461 --> 00:38:17.532 position:19% line:83% align:start
But no matter how much
she has, she's still unhappy.

00:38:17.565 --> 00:38:19.600 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hey, you listening to me?

00:38:19.634 --> 00:38:20.802 position:38% line:89% align:start
Enough.

00:38:20.835 --> 00:38:22.770 position:5% line:89% align:start
We can get a ship another place.

00:38:22.804 --> 00:38:23.871 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Yeah.

00:38:23.905 --> 00:38:25.740 position:10% line:83% align:start
[ZORO] Well, now that we're
done eating, let's go.

00:38:25.773 --> 00:38:28.876 position:5% line:89% align:start
[chuckles] Wait, one more thing.

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:30.912 position:16% line:83% align:start
You said you're looking
for crewmates, right?

00:38:30.945 --> 00:38:32.980 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah. You know somebody?

00:38:33.014 --> 00:38:34.081 position:38% line:89% align:start
Myself!

00:38:34.115 --> 00:38:36.784 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'd be happy to join up
as your captain!

00:38:36.818 --> 00:38:37.718 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ALL]
No thanks.

00:38:37.752 --> 00:38:39.554 position:38% line:83% align:start

--[LUFFY] Yo!
--[USOPP screams]

Where did you come from?
You could just say hi!

00:38:57.705 --> 00:38:59.507 position:7% line:89% align:start
I've been doin' some thinkin'.

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:01.542 position:21% line:83% align:start
Your old man's name
is Yasopp, right?

00:39:01.576 --> 00:39:02.543 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:39:02.577 --> 00:39:04.846 position:16% line:83% align:start
I actually met that guy
when I was a little kid.

00:39:04.879 --> 00:39:06.848 position:27% line:83% align:start
Are you serious?
You met my dad?

00:39:06.881 --> 00:39:07.515 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:39:07.548 --> 00:39:09.449 position:10% line:89% align:start
Do you know where he is now?

00:39:09.482 --> 00:39:10.852 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sorry, no idea.

00:39:10.885 --> 00:39:12.887 position:16% line:83% align:start
But I do know that he's
one of the crew members

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.723 position:13% line:83% align:start
on my favorite pirate ship
in the whole world!

So cool!

00:39:18.826 --> 00:39:19.727 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's nothin'.

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:22.563 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can shoot an ant

You know somethin',
little fella?

00:39:24.532 --> 00:39:26.167 position:24% line:83% align:start

[BOTH]
Big Bro!

01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:21.255 position:41% line:83% align:start

You guys okay?

01:15:21.288 --> 01:15:23.591 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Hey. Where's the Merry?

01:15:23.624 --> 01:15:27.061 position:10% line:83% align:start
Big Sis Nami took all of the
treasure and ran off with it!

01:15:27.094 --> 01:15:30.031 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ALL]
Huh? Seriously?

01:15:31.832 --> 01:15:33.734 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
They were nice guys.

01:15:34.969 --> 01:15:36.837 position:7% line:89% align:start
The next time that I see them,

01:15:36.871 --> 01:15:39.540 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wonder if they'll
let me join back up?

01:15:43.778 --> 01:15:45.980 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
I just wanna be free.

01:15:47.982 --> 01:15:50.151 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, Bellemere.

01:15:52.353 --> 01:15:54.722 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ARLONG]
Ah, Nami! You're back!

01:15:54.755 --> 01:15:57.291 position:13% line:83% align:start
I sure hope you brought in
a decent haul this time.

01:15:57.324 --> 01:15:59.326 position:24% line:83% align:start
Of course! I gotta
tell you, though,

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:02.730 position:16% line:83% align:start
it kinda feels like I've
got a big hole in my heart.

01:16:02.763 --> 01:16:05.766 position:27% line:83% align:start
[ARLONG laughs]
Now that's rich.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:08.302 position:27% line:83% align:start
We all know your
specialty is betrayal.

01:16:08.335 --> 01:16:11.005 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, yeah, is that
what you think?

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:17.344 position:19% line:89% align:start
[VILLAGERS chattering]

01:16:17.378 --> 01:16:19.213 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Good to see you all again!

01:16:19.246 --> 01:16:21.248 position:33% line:83% align:start
[VILLAGERS]
Huh?

01:16:21.282 --> 01:16:22.349 position:33% line:83% align:start
[VILLAGER A]
Nami?

01:16:22.383 --> 01:16:24.151 position:33% line:83% align:start
[VILLAGER M]
She's back.

01:16:37.431 --> 01:16:40.634 position:10% line:83% align:start
Looks like your reputation's
as terrible as ever, huh?

01:16:40.668 --> 01:16:41.502 position:33% line:89% align:start
I guess so.

01:16:41.536 --> 01:16:43.904 position:19% line:83% align:start
But Arlong's a pretty
reasonable guy.

01:16:43.938 --> 01:16:46.807 position:19% line:83% align:start
That money'll set this
whole thing straight.

01:16:46.841 --> 01:16:48.843 position:30% line:83% align:start
The two of us
have an agreement.

01:16:48.876 --> 01:16:52.079 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm going to earn the one
hundred million berries I need,

01:16:52.113 --> 01:16:54.982 position:24% line:83% align:start
and then I can buy
back this village!

01:16:55.683 --> 01:16:57.885 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ARLONG]
That girl's got a real gift!

01:16:57.918 --> 01:16:59.253 position:16% line:89% align:start
With Nami's sea charts,

01:16:59.286 --> 01:17:03.090 position:21% line:83% align:start
we'll have no one to
fear in these waters!

01:17:03.124 --> 01:17:04.925 position:24% line:83% align:start
She's going to be
a vital component

01:17:04.959 --> 01:17:07.394 position:19% line:83% align:start
in the creation of the
great Arlong Empire!

01:17:07.428 --> 01:17:09.964 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but after she collects
a hundred million berries,

01:17:09.997 --> 01:17:11.866 position:10% line:83% align:start
you promised you were gonna
let her and Coco Village

01:17:11.899 --> 01:17:14.001 position:19% line:83% align:start
off the hook forever,
isn't that right, Captain?

01:17:14.034 --> 01:17:15.002 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's right.

01:17:15.035 --> 01:17:18.005 position:19% line:83% align:start
And I would die before
going back on a bargain.

01:17:18.038 --> 01:17:20.074 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's who I am.

01:17:21.375 --> 01:17:23.744 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
You guys.

01:17:23.777 --> 01:17:25.079 position:24% line:89% align:start
Why are you here?

01:17:25.112 --> 01:17:28.149 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, you're our friend now,
so we came to get you.

01:17:28.182 --> 01:17:29.817 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ya ready to go?

01:17:29.850 --> 01:17:32.887 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're such a pain.
Friends, huh?

01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:35.389 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're just four idiots
who work together.

01:17:35.422 --> 01:17:36.223 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Hm?

01:17:36.257 --> 01:17:37.758 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
It'd be nice if you stopped

01:17:37.791 --> 01:17:39.693 position:27% line:83% align:start
butting into our
affairs, already.

01:17:39.727 --> 01:17:43.430 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're outsiders, take your
ship and get outta here.

01:17:43.464 --> 01:17:46.000 position:27% line:89% align:start
This is goodbye.

01:17:46.033 --> 01:17:48.769 position:33% line:89% align:start
But, Nami...

01:17:48.802 --> 01:17:50.404 position:38% line:89% align:start
[crash]

01:17:50.437 --> 01:17:56.777 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? Oh boy. What's wrong, Nami?

01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:58.045 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Nothing.

01:17:58.078 --> 01:18:01.815 position:7% line:83% align:start
We agreed that you could talk
to me about anything, remember?

01:18:06.086 --> 01:18:10.357 position:21% line:83% align:start
[NOJIKO] Now I see.
Somebody showed up for her.

01:18:12.026 --> 01:18:14.428 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NOJIKO]
Friends, huh?

01:18:14.461 --> 01:18:19.934 position:5% line:83% align:start
Must be tricky, 'cause for her,
that's a painful word.

01:18:24.104 --> 01:18:26.440 position:19% line:89% align:start
I fell asleep. [gasps]

01:18:28.976 --> 01:18:31.912 position:21% line:83% align:start
[NAMI] Just a little
bit more, Bellemere.

01:18:31.946 --> 01:18:34.415 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then we'll get back
everything we lost!

01:18:34.448 --> 01:18:35.416 position:33% line:89% align:start
The village.

01:18:35.449 --> 01:18:37.451 position:19% line:89% align:start
The tangerine orchard.

01:18:37.484 --> 01:18:39.787 position:24% line:89% align:start
And even my dream.

01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:42.356 position:5% line:83% align:start
[BELLEMERE] You learned to draw
sea charts, and now land maps?

01:18:42.389 --> 01:18:43.958 position:35% line:89% align:start
Good job!

01:18:43.991 --> 01:18:45.926 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Yeah!

01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.529 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna use
my navigation skills

01:18:47.562 --> 01:18:49.463 position:27% line:83% align:start
to travel around
the whole world.

01:18:49.496 --> 01:18:52.967 position:5% line:83% align:start
And when I'm done, I'll draw out
a map of everything I see!

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.836 position:13% line:83% align:start
So this is your first step
towards your dream, huh?

01:18:55.869 --> 01:18:58.038 position:35% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

01:18:58.072 --> 01:18:59.507 position:16% line:89% align:start
Okay, here you go, girl!

01:18:59.541 --> 01:19:02.209 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's a custom-made
Bellemere original!

01:19:02.243 --> 01:19:05.446 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nice try! That's a
stinky hand-me-down!

01:19:05.479 --> 01:19:07.348 position:7% line:89% align:start
I want some clothes of my own!

01:19:07.381 --> 01:19:08.048 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NOJIKO]
What's wrong with...

01:19:08.082 --> 01:19:11.352 position:7% line:89% align:start
Okay. Let's go to the orchard.

01:19:11.385 --> 01:19:13.487 position:30% line:83% align:start
Except I'm not
really your sister!

01:19:13.521 --> 01:19:15.823 position:24% line:83% align:start
Because we are not
related by blood!

01:19:15.856 --> 01:19:17.157 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NOJIKO]
I know. So what?

--Nami! No!
--[NOJIKO gasps]

Blood's not important!

Never say that.

01:19:23.864 --> 01:19:25.499 position:33% line:83% align:start
Okay, do you
understand me, girl?

01:19:25.533 --> 01:19:26.467 position:38% line:89% align:start
Shut up!

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:28.335 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's not like you're
our real mother anyway,

01:19:28.369 --> 01:19:29.870 position:21% line:89% align:start
so what do you care?

01:19:29.903 --> 01:19:33.173 position:10% line:83% align:start
You'd be better off without
us here, wouldn't you?

01:19:33.207 --> 01:19:35.142 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why did you have to adopt me?

01:19:35.175 --> 01:19:38.078 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wish I lived with
somebody richer!

01:19:39.013 --> 01:19:41.248 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, if you hate living
in this house so much,

01:19:41.282 --> 01:19:42.850 position:19% line:89% align:start
the door is that way!

[VILLAGERS chattering]

01:19:53.227 --> 01:19:55.396 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, is that the reason
you came here?

01:19:55.429 --> 01:19:58.132 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's right,
I ran away from home!

01:19:58.165 --> 01:20:00.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
Bellemere would be way
happier if she didn't

01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:02.303 position:5% line:89% align:start
have us to take care of, anyway.

01:20:02.336 --> 01:20:04.305 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, what makes you say that?

01:20:04.338 --> 01:20:06.508 position:21% line:83% align:start
'Cause looking after
two kids is expensive,

and she's got no money.

01:20:07.808 --> 01:20:12.012 position:5% line:83% align:start

think about those things, eh?

01:20:12.046 --> 01:20:13.280 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't you worry.

01:20:13.314 --> 01:20:17.017 position:5% line:83% align:start

Really, what do you mean?

01:20:19.219 --> 01:20:21.523 position:27% line:83% align:start
Trust me, kiddo,
that girl surprised everyone

01:20:21.556 --> 01:20:23.390 position:24% line:83% align:start
when she left the
village and came back

01:20:23.424 --> 01:20:25.192 position:27% line:83% align:start
as a respectable
member of the Navy.

The Navy?

01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:28.429 position:5% line:89% align:start

01:27:47.434 --> 01:27:49.971 position:13% line:83% align:start
[NOJIKO] He says he'll let
you buy back the village?

01:27:50.004 --> 01:27:51.471 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Yeah, but in return,

01:27:51.506 --> 01:27:55.308 position:16% line:83% align:start
I have to join his crew
and draw charts.

01:27:55.342 --> 01:27:57.310 position:13% line:89% align:start
If I ask anybody for help,

01:27:57.344 --> 01:27:59.747 position:27% line:83% align:start
more people will
end up getting hurt.

01:27:59.781 --> 01:28:02.482 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's the last thing
I want to happen.

01:28:02.517 --> 01:28:04.786 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm not going to cry anymore.

01:28:04.819 --> 01:28:08.321 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll fight hard and
fix this, on my own!

01:28:10.792 --> 01:28:13.528 position:16% line:83% align:start
[NAMI] No one'll find it
in the tangerine orchard!

01:28:13.561 --> 01:28:17.532 position:5% line:83% align:start
When it's full, that means I've
got a hundred million berries!

01:28:17.565 --> 01:28:20.701 position:13% line:83% align:start
[NOJIKO] Are you sure you
should steal from pirates?

01:28:20.735 --> 01:28:22.369 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
We live in the Pirate Era,

01:28:22.402 --> 01:28:24.572 position:7% line:89% align:start
so I'm making the best of it!

01:28:26.373 --> 01:28:28.910 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
It took a while.

01:28:28.943 --> 01:28:32.445 position:27% line:83% align:start
But I've almost
got enough money.

01:28:32.479 --> 01:28:34.816 position:7% line:89% align:start
Soon, I'll be free of Arlong,

01:28:34.849 --> 01:28:37.484 position:16% line:83% align:start
and this whole nightmare
will be over.

01:28:38.451 --> 01:28:40.555 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Just wait, Bellemere.

01:28:40.588 --> 01:28:43.456 position:21% line:83% align:start
After this, I think
I'll finally be able to

01:28:43.490 --> 01:28:46.027 position:30% line:83% align:start
smile from the
bottom of my heart.

01:28:49.063 --> 01:28:51.999 position:19% line:83% align:start
What business does the
Navy have with Nami?

01:28:52.033 --> 01:28:55.435 position:19% line:83% align:start
You just lead the way
quietly, all right?

01:28:59.707 --> 01:29:02.877 position:10% line:89% align:start
Here we go. My final heist!

01:29:05.112 --> 01:29:07.114 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NEZUMI]
Pardon me.

01:29:07.148 --> 01:29:09.584 position:30% line:83% align:start
But aren't you
the criminal Nami?

01:29:09.617 --> 01:29:12.553 position:16% line:83% align:start
[NAMI] Criminal? Yeah,
I guess you could call me that.

01:29:12.587 --> 01:29:15.723 position:21% line:83% align:start
I am a member of the
Arlong Pirates, after all.

01:29:15.756 --> 01:29:18.659 position:13% line:83% align:start
Mess with me and you'll be
hearing from Arlong himself.

01:29:18.693 --> 01:29:19.927 position:30% line:89% align:start
A pirate, eh?

01:29:19.961 --> 01:29:21.996 position:27% line:83% align:start
According to the
information I was given,

01:29:22.029 --> 01:29:24.532 position:19% line:89% align:start
you're a simple thief.

01:29:24.565 --> 01:29:27.635 position:16% line:83% align:start
From what I understand,
the only thing you're guilty of

01:29:27.668 --> 01:29:29.904 position:21% line:83% align:start
is swiping treasure
from pirates.

01:29:29.937 --> 01:29:33.674 position:13% line:83% align:start
And any valuables that are
stolen from criminals, well...

01:29:33.708 --> 01:29:36.878 position:21% line:83% align:start
They legally become
property of the government!

01:29:36.911 --> 01:29:39.046 position:16% line:89% align:start
What? You're kidding me!

01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:40.681 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NEZUMI]
Find the stolen goods!

01:29:40.715 --> 01:29:41.649 position:35% line:83% align:start
[MARINES]
Sir!

01:29:41.682 --> 01:29:43.818 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Wait a minute! Back off!

01:29:43.851 --> 01:29:46.687 position:13% line:89% align:start
Stay out of there! [gasps]

01:29:48.589 --> 01:29:50.490 position:27% line:89% align:start
[MARINES groan]

01:29:50.524 --> 01:29:51.626 position:30% line:89% align:start
What is this?

01:29:51.659 --> 01:29:53.628 position:19% line:83% align:start
Doesn't the Navy have
anything more important to do

01:29:53.661 --> 01:29:55.196 position:7% line:89% align:start
than come after a petty thief?

01:29:55.229 --> 01:29:57.865 position:7% line:83% align:start
Do you not realize that every
single person on this island

01:29:57.899 --> 01:30:00.134 position:5% line:89% align:start
is a slave under Arlong's rule?

01:30:00.167 --> 01:30:03.070 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's awfully big talk
for a lowly criminal.

--[MARINE C] Colonel!
--[NEZUMI] Hm?

01:30:04.739 --> 01:30:06.941 position:27% line:83% align:start
This orchard is
kind of suspicious.

01:30:06.974 --> 01:30:08.509 position:30% line:89% align:start
So dig it up.

01:30:08.542 --> 01:30:10.811 position:33% line:83% align:start
[NAMI gasps]
Stop it!

01:30:10.845 --> 01:30:13.114 position:19% line:83% align:start
Keep your filthy hands
off this orchard!

01:30:13.147 --> 01:30:15.683 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's not yours! Stop!

01:30:15.716 --> 01:30:18.853 position:24% line:83% align:start
I need that money!
Do you hear me?

01:30:18.886 --> 01:30:20.021 position:21% line:89% align:start
You leave her alone.

01:30:20.054 --> 01:30:23.190 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's planning to use her money
to reclaim Coco Village!

01:30:23.224 --> 01:30:24.992 position:21% line:83% align:start
What makes you think
you have the right

01:30:25.026 --> 01:30:27.795 position:21% line:83% align:start
to take it from her,
you sniveling rat?

01:30:27.828 --> 01:30:29.797 position:21% line:89% align:start
[gasps] But wait...

01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:31.498 position:19% line:89% align:start
Genzo, how'd you know?

01:30:31.532 --> 01:30:33.701 position:38% line:83% align:start
[GENZO]
We've always known, Nami.

01:30:33.734 --> 01:30:36.037 position:24% line:83% align:start
We just pretended
that we didn't.

01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:38.072 position:30% line:83% align:start
If you'd ever
decided to stop this

01:30:38.105 --> 01:30:39.774 position:7% line:89% align:start
and run away from the island,

01:30:39.807 --> 01:30:42.176 position:27% line:83% align:start
we wanted you to
feel free to do so,

01:30:42.209 --> 01:30:45.680 position:13% line:83% align:start
instead of letting our sad
situation hold you back.

01:30:45.713 --> 01:30:46.881 position:30% line:89% align:start
Is that true?

01:30:46.914 --> 01:30:49.016 position:10% line:83% align:start

gonna help save the village,

01:30:49.050 --> 01:30:50.952 position:24% line:83% align:start

get out of here!

01:30:51.986 --> 01:30:53.020 position:27% line:89% align:start
And hurry it up!

01:30:53.054 --> 01:30:55.890 position:19% line:83% align:start
Unless you want Arlong
to attack your ship, too!

01:30:55.923 --> 01:30:58.793 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh. That's unlikely.

01:30:58.826 --> 01:30:59.527 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

You still can't find it?

not a needle in a haystack!

Huh? Oh, I dunno,

it's just a rough

Maybe. Maybe not.

How could the Navy have
stooped to becoming
