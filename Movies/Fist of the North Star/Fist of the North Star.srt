1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:07,140
(dramatic orchestral music)

2
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:31,331
(explosion booming) (rumbling)

3
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:39,039
- [Narrator] Life is theresult of the struggle

4
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,310
between dynamic  opposites, form and chaos

5
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,747
substance and oblivion,light and dark

6
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:50,584
and all the infinite variations of yin and yang.

7
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:53,020
When the pendulumswings in favor of one,

8
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,490
it eventually swings back  in favor of its opposite,

9
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,192
and thus the balance of the universe is maintained.

10
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:06,133
On Earth this balance was disrupted by a nuclear Holocaust,

11
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:09,369
which rendered technology unless

12
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:12,339
and devastated the planet's population.

13
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:24,851
(dramatic orchestral music)

14
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:46,506
(grand orchestral music)

15
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,475
(soft orchestral music)

16
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:32,079
(birds chirping)

17
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,639
(explosion booming)

18
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,396
(explosion booming)

19
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,506
(thunder roaring)

20
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,820
(dramatic music)

21
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,777
Human existence  became a struggle

22
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:14,080
for uncontaminated  water and food.

23
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,615
Only the strongest survived.

24
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,887
In this age of chaos, men were fearful,

25
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:24,791
and power over other men made them feel less afraid.

26
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:30,130
The flame of life on Earth was sputtering,

27
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,234
and if extinguished,  would never be rekindled.

28
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:38,672
But there were those whose concern was not for themselves

29
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,708
but for their world and its inhabitants.

30
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,016
(wind howling)

31
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,524
(light orchestral music)

32
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,272
- Where can we go from here?

33
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:13,540
We've been walking for days,

34
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,376
and wherever we look the Earth is barren.

35
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,611
It's a wasteland.

36
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,714
We can't let it end like this.

37
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,817
If we fail all that'll be left is dust.

38
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:29,522
- Who knows?

39
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:33,493
(gasping)

40
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,062
(gong blaring)

41
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:40,667
Shin.

42
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,010
- The time has come.

43
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,578
Julia is mine now.

44
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:55,248
(dramatic orchestral music)

45
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,988
In times like these only the strongest

46
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,723
may possess what  is most valuable.

47
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,092
- (gasping) What are you doing?

48
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:06,926
- Let her go.

49
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,495
- Get back.

50
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,997
I warn you don't stand in my way, Ken.

51
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,300
I don't wanna hurt you,but I will if I have to.

52
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,802
You see Julia is  mine, understand?

53
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,170
- This is madness.

54
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,605
The fists of the north and south

55
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,774
aren't ever supposedto fight you know that.

56
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,042
- Perhaps it was true once,

57
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,076
but now rules are meaningless.

58
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,511
Defend yourself, (grunting).

59
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:29,349
(tense orchestral music)

60
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,420
(soft grunting)

61
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:42,996
(dramatic orchestral music)

62
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:45,231
(grunting)

63
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,108
Come, Julia, it's over.

64
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,947
- Oh, I can't leave him now not like this.

65
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:01,948
Ken, Ken.

66
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:06,753
Ken.

67
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:12,258
(dramatic orchestral music)

68
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,695
- Brother, the time has come for us

69
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,264
to teach that bastard Shin a lesson now.

70
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,939
(gasping)

71
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,343
- I've won and you have lost.

72
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,545
The question is why?

73
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,915
Because the power of your will has no ambition to feed it

74
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:41,087
or the need to crush your enemy.

75
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:41,921
(grunting)

76
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:42,756
- Oh, no.

77
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,626
Shin, at one time you  were Ken's closest friend.

78
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,128
He trusted and respected you.

79
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,196
When you were chosen asFist of the South Star,

80
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,699
he was glad for you, glad  for his friend's success.

81
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,735
But you were never really  his friend, were you?

82
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,004
- Yes, I was, but then he left,

83
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,873
and when he came back, he brought you.

84
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:04,444
The first time I saw you I knew you'd be mine someday,

85
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:05,979
and that day has come.

86
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:08,081
- Shin's broken all the rules,

87
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:10,717
and to think that Ken trusted him like a brother.

88
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:11,951
But we're his brothers.

89
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,153
You're the strongest, Raoh.

90
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:14,220
You've got to get down there

91
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,922
and challenge Shin to a fight.

92
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,390
You know you can take him.

93
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,625
Now with Ken out of the way

94
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,293
you will be the Fist of the North Star.

95
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,898
Of course, it's your decision to face him or not,

96
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,433
and I won't blame  you if you don't.

97
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,134
After all, we both  know what happens

98
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:31,070
if you challenge the power  of the Fist and fail.

99
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,872
You either bleed to death,

100
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,074
become a mindless vegetable or worse.

101
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,912
But I'm certain you're strong enough to win.

102
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,614
Who knows better than me I'm your brother, aren't I?

103
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,219
- [Shin] Believe me I now  how much you love Julia,

104
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:49,389
but I'm certain that you  want what's best for her.

105
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:50,457
- [Julia] Ken.

106
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:51,958
(soft sobbing)

107
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,293
- For instance, you want  her to be safe, don't you?

108
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,562
Look at how you've  protected her.

109
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:56,830
Under the circumstances,

110
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,898
it's clear that she'll be safer with me.

111
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,300
- I'll never be yours, Shin.

112
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:04,370
- Julia, you have no choice.

113
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,039
You're mine now.

114
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,641
- Force is the only way you'll get me to leave him.

115
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,044
But I won't ever go of my own free will.

116
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,313
- Oh, perhaps I can change your mind.

117
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:21,254
(dramatic orchestral music)

118
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,861
(loud screaming)

119
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,899
(soft gasping)

120
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,769
(loud screaming)

121
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:39,873
Have you changed your mind yet?

122
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,913
(loud screaming)

123
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:47,714
- Ken.

124
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:50,483
- It's up to you, Julia.

125
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,820
Does he live or does he die?

126
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,821
Say it, Julia.

127
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,222
Speak and I'll stop.

128
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,757
Just say you belong to me.

129
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,461
- She knows I'd rather  die than hear that, Shin.

130
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,001
Just as I know that she'd  rather die than say it.

131
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,335
- [Julia] Ken.

132
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,171
- If that's the way youwant it, then so be it.

133
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,439
- [Julia] No!

134
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,208
- I hate to do this to an old friend,

135
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,510
but I'm afraid you've left me no choice.

136
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,280
(loud screaming)

137
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:26,553
(gasping)

138
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:27,453
- No, more.

139
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,622
- If you say it.

140
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,325
- No, Julia.

141
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:35,295
- I'm yours, Shin.

142
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,664
- Louder, much louder.

143
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,065
When you whisper like that,

144
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:40,733
it's hard for me to believe that you're sincere,

145
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,369
so say it again butthis time with feeling.

146
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,071
Make me a believer, Julia.

147
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,707
(Ken screaming)

148
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,644
- Shin, I'm yours.

149
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,347
I give myself to you with all my heart.

150
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:55,815
Just don't hurt him again.

151
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,050
It's over, you've won.

152
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:04,190
(Shin chuckling)

153
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,994
(groaning)

154
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,869
- Did you hear what she just said, Ken.

155
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,238
Fascinating, isn't it,  how changeable woman are?

156
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,707
One minute they  say they want you,

157
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,875
and the next minute they say they want someone else.

158
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,644
That's because they onlywant who they've got

159
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:26,479
until someone better comes along.

160
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,449
(loud chuckling)

161
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,818
But, of course, she is right.

162
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:35,955
Julia is tremendously loyal to whomever is the strongest.

163
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,391
I'm afraid you just don't qualify.

164
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:41,127
- Ken (sobbing).

165
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,066
Ken.

166
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,601
(somber orchestral music)

167
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,402
Ken.

168
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,439
Ken.

169
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,240
No.

170
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,409
Ken.

171
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,349
- Come, Julia, it's time to go.

172
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,385
(gasping)

173
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:06,886
- Julia.

174
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:07,720
Julia.

175
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:09,989
Julia.

176
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:11,758
- Ken.

177
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:13,993
I'm sorry.

178
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,532
- He's still breathing.

179
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,633
Think he'll make it?

180
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,536
- Even if he does,  he'll be weak.

181
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:27,674
The Fist of the North Star  must be strong like me.

182
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,208
- If you're so sure of yourself,

183
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,944
why don't you go after Shin and challenge him right now?

184
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,850
You'll have to face him sooner or later.

185
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,485
- Julia, come back.

186
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,358
She left the seeds.

187
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,867
- These seeds will make the Earth green again someday.

188
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:05,812
(wind blowing swiftly)

189
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,735
(soft chuckling)

190
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,482
(soft chuckling)

191
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,317
- I hate to admit it, Ken,

192
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:46,352
but our brother Raoh is right.

193
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:50,490
You're weak still there's no point in taking any chances.

194
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,291
So now you die.

195
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,982
(loud chuckling)

196
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:20,520
Sleep well, Ken.

197
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,169
(loud chuckling)

198
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,099
(door creaking)

199
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,605
- Ryuuken, the Fist of the North Star has been defeated.

200
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:15,241
Shin crushed him as he would an insect.

201
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,476
When you chose Ken  as your successor,

202
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,278
I told you that it  should've been me,

203
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,246
and I was right.

204
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:23,049
(dramatic orchestral music)

205
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:25,017
Stand up I'll prove it to you.

206
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,119
I challenge you to a test of strength.

207
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:31,190
- Physical strength is no  substitute for perception.

208
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,559
For perception is the key

209
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:37,029
which unlocks the intangible power of the spirit.

210
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,297
You perceive nothing.

211
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:46,672
- You silly old fool.

212
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,975
Stop hiding behind  your metaphors

213
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:51,577
and metaphysical fantasies.

214
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,547
The Fist of the North Star is dead.

215
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,048
- Your point?

216
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,851
- Don't you understand now I'm Fist of the North Star.

217
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,560
(loud grunting)

218
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,378
(explosion booming)

219
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,803
(statues crumbling)

220
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,608
My powers are greater than ever before.

221
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:58,244
No one can stand against me.

222
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,845
- Maybe but you see,

223
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:03,316
power without perceptionis spiritually useless

224
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,484
and, therefore,  of no true value.

225
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,585
- Useless (chuckling).

226
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:10,556
Ryuuken, what a foolishold man you are.

227
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:14,794
Any tool is useful ifyou know how to use it,

228
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:18,798
and I've become  an expert, watch.

229
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,004
Admit it at this moment

230
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:28,240
I'm more powerful than you ever were.

231
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,209
I am Fist of the North Star.

232
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:34,080
- I don't agree,

233
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:36,949
and I never shall.

234
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,218
Go and do what you must, Raoh,

235
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:42,188
but never set foot in this dojo again.

236
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:46,459
(explosion booming)

237
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,200
(wind howling)

238
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:08,714
(dramatic orchestral music)

239
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,387
(thunder crashing)

240
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,796
(thunder crashing)

241
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,840
- There's no one,

242
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,976
no one as worthy as I am.

243
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:40,379
(thunder roaring)

244
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:43,883
(gentle orchestral music)

245
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,930
I am the Fist of the North Star.

246
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,599
(thunder crashing)

247
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,734
Show me the power.

248
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,235
Prove that I'm right.

249
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:06,072
(thunder roaring)

250
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,042
Yes, show me now.

251
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,713
(dramatic orchestral music)

252
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,625
(soft gasping)

253
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,060
(loud chuckling)

254
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,729
(loud grunting)

255
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:07,233
- Please.

256
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:10,569
(blaring heavy metal music)

257
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,838
(grunting)

258
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,049
(grunting)

259
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,902
(engine approaching)

260
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,783
(dramatic orchestral music)

261
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,422
(lively rock music)

262
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:19,104
- Hey, leave us alone, you son of a bitch.

263
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,392
(loud screaming)

264
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:45,631
(window shattering)

265
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,836
(grunting)  Holy cow.

266
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,579
(grunting)  Holy shit.

267
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:42,888
(car crashing) (groaning)

268
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,865
- Hey, took a look.

269
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:54,333
I knew it.

270
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,367
I told you these two  would have food, didn't I?

271
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,936
I was right.

272
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,003
- Come on stop wasting time.

273
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,838
That buggy's had it.

274
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,307
Whatever village those kids came from

275
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:02,441
can't be too far from here.

276
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,642
We've gotta go tell Zenda now.

277
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,612
- Maybe it's just alose wire or something.

278
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,281
You're gonna start now you piece of crap, you understand.

279
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,017
(loud chuckling)

280
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:16,322
- Hey, my car what the, hey.

281
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:17,690
- What do you know, the kid's still alive.

282
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,659
- Get out of my car, you hear me, hey.

283
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:21,593
Took the food, every else,

284
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,929
but if you scratch that car,

285
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:25,497
I'm gonna be forced to kill ya.

286
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:26,565
(soft chuckling)

287
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:27,833
- Hey, what do we got here?

288
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,034
Maybe it's jewelry.

289
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,803
Nah, just a bunch of seeds,

290
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:33,238
a binge of crumby seedsnot worth anything.

291
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,107
(loud grunting)

292
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:36,375
Ow.

293
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,744
Give me that stick  you little, bitch.

294
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:40,245
- Let her go, let  her go, you ape.

295
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:41,947
- Hey, we let these kids go they'll warn the village.

296
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:42,881
Better get rid of them.

297
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,083
- Right.

298
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:46,685
You're sure a feistylittle runt, aren't ya?

299
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,589
Sweet dreams, kid.

300
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:52,057
(dramatic orchestral music)

301
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:52,891
Huh?

302
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:56,161
(grunting)

303
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:09,274
(electronic whirling)

304
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:30,396
(explosion booming)

305
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,898
What the hell?

306
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:40,139
(buildings crumbling)

307
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,216
- Wow.

308
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:32,491
(dramatic orchestral music)

309
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,063
(loud gasping)

310
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:11,897
- Come on.

311
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,570
(grunting)

312
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:35,220
(arrow clanking)

313
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:45,130
(grunting)

314
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:53,238
(loud screaming)

315
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,749
(whirring)

316
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:17,162
- Ready.

317
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:18,964
Now get him.

318
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:20,766
(loud screaming)

319
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:23,435
(loud grunting)

320
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:27,339
(screaming)

321
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:30,342
- Oh, shit.

322
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,046
(gasping)

323
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:39,017
(heavy gasping)

324
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:50,295
(gentle orchestral music)

325
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,045
How did you know we were in trouble?

326
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,181
You couldn't have hard anything, no way.

327
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:11,116
You were at least  a mile from town.

328
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,786
- Be that as it may Iheard the girl cry out.

329
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:16,488
- [Bat] That's bullshit.

330
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:17,422
- Hmm.

331
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,057
- I mean you couldn't have.

332
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,993
Whatever you heard  it wasn't her.

333
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:22,828
See Lynn's a mute,  can't say a thing.

334
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,065
Our families werefriends before the war,

335
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:30,469
and she used to talk so much, we called her motor mouth.

336
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:31,703
But then the war came,

337
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:32,938
and she was forced to watch

338
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,806
while her folks  were burned alive.

339
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:37,542
Ever since then she hasn't spoken a word.

340
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:38,677
Nice kid.

341
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:40,045
If you hadn't come along today,

342
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:41,513
I don't know what I would have,

343
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:44,182
hmm, great, fall asleep why don't ya?

344
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,594
(soft grunting)

345
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:58,196
(laughing)

346
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,031
- Yeah.

347
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:02,634
- Let's do it.

348
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,637
(heavy metal music)

349
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:20,652
(people screaming)

350
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:05,864
Listen you people, justbring us all your food

351
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,532
and water and we're on our way.

352
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:12,471
Refuse me and the girl  will be the first to die.

353
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:15,841
- If we give up, you'll most likely kill us all anyway.

354
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:17,309
(loud chuckling)

355
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:18,844
- Maybe so, but if ya don't,

356
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:20,245
I'll break this kid into pieces

357
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:21,847
and stuff them down your throat.

358
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,853
(loud grunting)

359
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,696
(spitting)

360
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:38,897
Who did that?

361
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,065
I dare you to come forward

362
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,266
and show me who you are.

363
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:52,010
- That's the one, get him.

364
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,148
(grunting)

365
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:59,785
(dramatic orchestral music)

366
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:07,192
- Hey, (grunting)

367
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:10,595
(dramatic orchestral music)

368
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,098
(screaming)

369
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,333
(grunting)

370
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:19,805
(screaming)

371
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:22,040
(grunting)

372
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:32,350
(screaming)

373
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,563
(knuckles cracking)

374
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:46,965
- Zenda, put her down and let her go.

375
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,367
- Yeah, sure I'll put her down

376
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,303
right after I break her neck.

377
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:55,540
(loud grunting)

378
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,950
(loud grunting)

379
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:15,160
(grunting)

380
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:23,869
(high pitch tone ringing)

381
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:31,142
(grunting)

382
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:37,015
- First you suffer thenyou die nice and slow.

383
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,083
You hear me.

384
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:39,784
'Cause when I fight,

385
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,787
it's always to the death.

386
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:45,190
- That's right.

387
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,791
In fact, you're already dead.

388
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,093
- Is that so?

389
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:48,927
Hmm.

390
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,198
(loud grunting)

391
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:59,437
(explosion booming)

392
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,781
(people gasping)

393
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,149
- Fist of the North Star.

394
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,076
- Lovely child, pity she can't speak.

395
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:41,379
Is there nothing you can do for her?

396
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:45,083
(gentle orchestral music)

397
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,618
- Lynn, is that your name?

398
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,589
My name's Ken.

399
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,391
What I'm about to do mightfeel a little strange at first,

400
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,493
but I promise not to hurt you, all right?

401
00:34:56,995 --> 00:34:59,331
I'm here because you cried out.

402
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,805
Yes, with your mind.

403
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:09,507
Let it rest now,serene and calm.

404
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:15,513
(high pitch tone ringing)

405
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:23,121
- [Bat] Lynn, are you all right?

406
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,757
- Don't worry, she'll  recover in a few moments.

407
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:27,959
She'll be able to speak now.

408
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,195
- Oh, come on that'd be a miracle.

409
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:31,396
Are you sure?

410
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:32,263
- For you, Lynn.

411
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:36,167
What's inside is as valuable as anything on Earth.

412
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:39,337
The seeds of new life

413
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:40,672
I know of only two people

414
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,674
special enough to  make them bloom,

415
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:44,642
and one of them is you.

416
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:57,656
- Oh, don't go.

417
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:58,890
Stay here with us.

418
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:02,193
- Talk about weird, boy, what an odd ball.

419
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,797
Lynn, you talked.

420
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:07,399
- Why did he have to go away?

421
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:08,233
Ken.

422
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:15,040
Oh, Ken.

423
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:26,117
(wind howling)

424
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:33,458
(nunchucks whirling)

425
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:40,832
(loud grunting)

426
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,408
(grunting)

427
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:52,143
(laughing)

428
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:55,647
(gentle orchestral music)

429
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,859
- Hey, I thought you was a girl.

430
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,894
Either way you die.

431
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,197
- Sorry, I don't agree.

432
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:15,734
I believe you are theone who's about to die.

433
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:22,173
(high pitch tone ringing)

434
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:30,548
In fact, there's  no doubt about it.

435
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,353
(men grunting)

436
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,693
(grunting)

437
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:43,795
Hey, these belong to you?

438
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:54,672
- Oh, no (screaming).

439
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:57,041
- Listen, ass wipe, I need some information.

440
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,276
Tell me what I wanna know,

441
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,511
and I'll save your  miserable life,

442
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:01,379
otherwise you can  bleed to death.

443
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,381
Now tell me

444
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:06,584
where's the one they call the Fist of the North Star.

445
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:10,255
(dramatic orchestral music)

446
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:17,729
- These fools refuse to acknowledge Lord Ken's authority.

447
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:19,063
Now they're dead.

448
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:23,168
So, you there doyou live or die?

449
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:24,836
- Please, oh, please let me go.

450
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:26,671
- First, you must  show your master

451
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:28,173
the respect that he deserves.

452
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:30,975
Bow down to my Lord Ken  the man with seven wounds,

453
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,544
the Fist of the North Star.

454
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:34,112
- I'll say anything, do anything you want,

455
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:35,914
just don't kill me.

456
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:37,215
- See how you've neglected

457
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:39,050
the statue of your  lord and leader.

458
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:42,320
Why one might think that this entire village was disloyal.

459
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,523
Now's your chance to convince me of your loyalty.

460
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,859
Tell me, who's your master?

461
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:50,128
- [Prisoner] The Fist of the North Star.

462
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:53,398
- Yeah, right, we might  just have a winner folks.

463
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:54,899
Just one more thing.

464
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:57,602
All you gotta do is decapitate your friend there.

465
00:38:57,602 --> 00:38:58,903
(gasping)

466
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,271
- Go on.

467
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:01,372
- Yeah, you heard him.

468
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:04,042
Just do it.

469
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,580
- [Man] What are you  waiting for an invitation.

470
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,748
(man grunting)

471
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:12,584
- No, I can't do it, I just can't do it.

472
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:14,118
- You call that loyalty.

473
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:16,287
You had your chance,  asshole, and you blew it.

474
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:17,355
Who needs you.

475
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,958
(women crying)

476
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,596
- Why, why would the man who killed Zenda

477
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:27,332
and saved our village send these animals here to kill us?

478
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:29,434
I can't believe the Fist of the North Star

479
00:39:29,434 --> 00:39:30,401
would do such a thing.

480
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,604
- Oh, yeah.

481
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:33,438
Guess again.

482
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,774
(screaming)

483
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:38,076
- Who's that guy?

484
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:39,310
- My name is Rei.

485
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,912
I'm looking for the man you've described,

486
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:42,146
the man with seven wounds

487
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,616
who calls himself theFist of the North Star.

488
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,585
(grunting)

489
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:48,553
- All right you.

490
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:49,754
- Hold it.

491
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:51,556
I'll give you this much,

492
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,858
you got guts walking in here like this.

493
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,426
Give me that.

494
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:57,629
So with all due respect,

495
00:39:57,629 --> 00:40:00,031
I'll let you be the oneto cut his head off.

496
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:01,566
- [Rei] That's quite an honor,

497
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,401
but I'd hate for you to miss all that fun on my account.

498
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,669
You sure about this?

499
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:06,638
- Hey, what are friends for, right?

500
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,942
(grunting)

501
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:15,146
Wait a minute, I was talking about the other guy.

502
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:17,315
- Silly me, what  a foolish mistake.

503
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:18,750
- I got a splitting headache.

504
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,051
- Oh.

505
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:22,320
(loud groaning)

506
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,721
Better now.

507
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:26,291
(men groaning)

508
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:42,407
Now take me to your boss,

509
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:43,941
Ken, the man with  the seven wounds,

510
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:44,976
the Fist of the North Star.

511
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:46,644
- The hell I will (groaning).

512
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:52,317
(groaning)

513
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:55,086
- One question, satisfy my curiosity.

514
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:57,121
That statue in the town square

515
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,222
who's it suppose to be?

516
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:01,426
- The Fist of the North Star.

517
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:03,761
(screaming)

518
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,166
(dramatic orchestral music)

519
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:09,367
- It's a good likeness,

520
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:11,169
but it's not the Fist of the North Star.

521
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:15,640
(grunting)

522
00:41:17,275 --> 00:41:20,445
My brother Jagi always did have a glass jaw.

523
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:24,115
(dramatic orchestral music)

524
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:33,391
(soft gasping)

525
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:35,560
- [Jagi] Shine them perfectly

526
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,261
or I'll make youlick them clean.

527
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,467
- Yes, Lord Jagi.

528
00:41:42,467 --> 00:41:43,701
- [Jagi] Alei,  how dare you speak

529
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:46,037
to your lord and masterwithout permission.

530
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:48,473
Such insubordination must be punished.

531
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:49,674
You disappoint me.

532
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:53,978
Get up and bring me the whip.

533
00:42:00,585 --> 00:42:02,120
- Jagi is pretending to be me.

534
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,922
He's this man with sevenwounds you've been looking for.

535
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:06,357
- That may be so,

536
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,059
but I won't know if you're  telling me the truth

537
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:09,727
until I find him.

538
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,596
- Yes, I understand.

539
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:12,997
But since we both  wanna find him,

540
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,999
why don't we join  force until we do.

541
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:17,902
- That's fair enough.

542
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:19,437
A truce until I know for certain

543
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:23,074
who's responsible for kidnapping my sister.

544
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:24,175
Her wedding veil.

545
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:25,410
She was about to marry

546
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:27,745
her lifelong sweetheart,Ken, she was so happy.

547
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:30,148
I'd been away for a while,

548
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:32,250
and was on my way home when it happened.

549
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:35,219
Our village was attacked and almost everyone was killed.

550
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:38,022
It was one of the survivors who told me

551
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:39,757
that Alei was still alive,

552
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:41,292
and that the man who'd taken her

553
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:44,062
had seven wounds and wore an iron mask.

554
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:46,731
(dramatic tone)

555
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:54,472
(heavy gasping)

556
00:42:55,473 --> 00:42:58,109
(heavy gasping)

557
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,623
- [Jagi] Ken.

558
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:13,858
- Not now, Jagi.

559
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:15,593
- [Jagi] As usual you dismiss me like some

560
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,663
stray dog begging forscraps but not anymore.

561
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,065
- What's the gun for?

562
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:22,200
If you think you can beat me,

563
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,034
then use your fists.

564
00:43:23,034 --> 00:43:24,535
- [Jagi] You idiot.

565
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:26,671
I don't care about codes of honor or bullshit philosophy.

566
00:43:26,671 --> 00:43:29,040
I want what's mine and now I'm gonna get it.

567
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:31,576
(grunting)

568
00:43:31,576 --> 00:43:33,311
- Stop it, you're acting like a fool.

569
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,248
(thudding)

570
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:39,717
(heavy breathing)

571
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:41,052
- [Jagi] You're the youngest.

572
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:42,286
You don't deserve to be fist.

573
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,322
You'll die.

574
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:45,723
(loud grunting)

575
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:47,892
(yelling)

576
00:43:50,895 --> 00:43:52,663
(groaning)

577
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:55,066
I'm gonna rip you in to--

578
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:57,735
(loud groaning)

579
00:44:10,615 --> 00:44:13,618
(breathing heavily)

580
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:20,858
- Most of my life I've called you brother.

581
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:21,692
No more.

582
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,763
(breathing heavily)

583
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:49,587
- Lord Jagi, the fat one has disappeared.

584
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:51,923
Lord Jagi.

585
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:53,724
(breathing heavily)

586
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:57,662
(suspenseful orchestral music)

587
00:45:06,237 --> 00:45:09,006
(loud screaming)

588
00:45:15,613 --> 00:45:16,981
(gasping)

589
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:17,882
- Well.

590
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:19,584
(soft sobbing)

591
00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:21,018
I'm ashamed of you, Jackal.

592
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:22,787
I didn't think that  anything could scare you,

593
00:45:22,787 --> 00:45:24,822
but it seems I was wrong.

594
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:27,291
You look like you've seen a ghost or worse.

595
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,496
Do you think I don't know  how disgusting my face is.

596
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:35,333
You can't even bear to look at me, can you?

597
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:37,468
- [Jackal] Please, please  my lord forgive me.

598
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:40,571
I didn't mean to (groaning).

599
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,907
(screaming)

600
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:46,877
- The scum who don't pay proper respect to their lord

601
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:48,212
don't deserve to live.

602
00:45:59,724 --> 00:46:02,727
- So this pretender, this  so-call brother of yours

603
00:46:02,727 --> 00:46:04,862
has his hooks into Alei.

604
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:06,263
- Until we find her.

605
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:12,637
- [Jagi] So Ken has finally come, has he?

606
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:14,205
Alei.

607
00:46:14,205 --> 00:46:15,373
- [Alei] Master.

608
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:17,875
- [Jagi] You mightbecome useful after all.

609
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:19,677
- How may I serve you, my lord?

610
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:25,950
(grunting)

611
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:29,253
(rumbling)

612
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,200
(soft chuckling)

613
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:47,471
- Well, what have we here?

614
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,141
Why, of course, you mustbe Lord Jagi's brother.

615
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:53,177
He told me that you'd be showing up sooner or later.

616
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:56,180
- Good, now get out of my way, pig.

617
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,983
- Nope, I don't think so, not today.

618
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:00,918
See the boss told me to stop ya,

619
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:03,254
and nobody gets by me unless I say so.

620
00:47:03,254 --> 00:47:05,990
(grunting)

621
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,526
(soft chuckling)

622
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:09,994
Hey, what's the matter, little fella

623
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:11,362
you got your hand stuck.

624
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:12,697
You're not the first one it's happened to

625
00:47:12,697 --> 00:47:14,532
and you won't be the last.

626
00:47:14,532 --> 00:47:16,901
You see, that's why I'mLord Jagi's bodyguard.

627
00:47:16,901 --> 00:47:18,602
He doesn't like  uninvited guests,

628
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:20,905
and since you don't have an invitation,

629
00:47:20,905 --> 00:47:23,240
I'm afraid you're gonna have to leave.

630
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:28,245
(laughing)

631
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:30,915
Next time call first.

632
00:47:30,915 --> 00:47:33,651
(soft chuckling)

633
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:35,920
- Need a hand?

634
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,189
- I do appreciate the offer,

635
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:41,358
but I can handle this guy by myself, thanks.

636
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,762
- Yeah, that's what you think, wise guy.

637
00:47:44,762 --> 00:47:47,431
(loud grunting)

638
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,512
Ha, nice try, guy.

639
00:48:03,781 --> 00:48:06,717
- Say your goodbyes, lard ass, because you're already dead.

640
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,886
(yelling)

641
00:48:11,789 --> 00:48:12,623
- You see?

642
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:13,557
What did I tell ya?

643
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,259
Still in one piece, good as new.

644
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:17,595
(screaming)

645
00:48:21,432 --> 00:48:22,666
- Hmm.

646
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:24,802
A little sloppy but interesting technique.

647
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:33,677
(heavy breathing)

648
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:55,332
- Jagi.

649
00:48:58,302 --> 00:48:59,837
- [Jagi] Dear brother, welcome.

650
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:08,512
(breathing heavily)

651
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:12,683
- He's the one.

652
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:14,819
- Allow me to introduce my brother,

653
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:17,621
the one who killed your  parents and abducted Alei.

654
00:49:19,223 --> 00:49:21,759
- [Jagi] So Alei'sbrother isn't that nice.

655
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:23,961
A family reunion how touching.

656
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,597
Let the show begin.

657
00:49:26,597 --> 00:49:28,766
(gasping)

658
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:30,801
- My lord, I am at your command.

659
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:31,802
What is your wish?

660
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,070
I shall do anything

661
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,072
and everything in my power to please you.

662
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:37,308
- Alei, no.

663
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:39,777
Alei.

664
00:49:39,777 --> 00:49:42,980
- Oh, I understand you've  given me to another,

665
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,215
a new master.

666
00:49:44,215 --> 00:49:45,616
As you wish, my lord.

667
00:49:45,616 --> 00:49:47,418
I bid my new master welcome

668
00:49:47,418 --> 00:49:48,953
and promise thatI will serve you

669
00:49:48,953 --> 00:49:50,821
as I have served Lord Jagi.

670
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,490
- Oh, no, Ken she  can't see a thing.

671
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,792
- [Jagi] True, but as a result,

672
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:56,961
her other senses are more acute.

673
00:49:56,961 --> 00:50:00,030
Her sense of touch for instance.

674
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,765
- You filthy animal.

675
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:02,933
(dramatic orchestral music)

676
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:05,569
(gasping)

677
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:08,873
- [Jagi] You'd kill to get  her back, wouldn't you?

678
00:50:08,873 --> 00:50:11,742
Then do us both a favorand kill my brother,

679
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:13,978
and your sister will be free to go.

680
00:50:13,978 --> 00:50:16,280
- Rei, you know it's a lie.

681
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:20,117
- [Jagi] Refuse and your sister will die.

682
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:23,420
(grunting)

683
00:50:24,555 --> 00:50:25,890
- Jagi's a coward.

684
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:27,591
He's so afraid of me he has to have others

685
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:29,059
do his fighting for him.

686
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:31,662
(chuckling)

687
00:50:31,662 --> 00:50:33,197
- [Jagi] You always were the clever one,

688
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:35,232
weren't you, brother?

689
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:37,568
But you cleverness won't do you any good.

690
00:50:37,568 --> 00:50:39,803
I know all your tricks.

691
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:42,106
I know you think that by calling me a coward

692
00:50:42,106 --> 00:50:44,675
you'll maneuver into making a mistake.

693
00:50:44,675 --> 00:50:48,212
You've made a fool of me all my life but not this time.

694
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:51,448
Now I hold the winning hand, brother.

695
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:55,185
- Winning hand, sure and everyone respects a winner, right?

696
00:50:58,489 --> 00:50:59,990
You think anyonewill respect you

697
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:03,327
for kidnapping a helpless girl and holding her hostage

698
00:51:03,327 --> 00:51:06,430
and using her as a shield to protect yourself from me.

699
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:09,133
- Everyone will pay heed to Lord Jagi.

700
00:51:09,133 --> 00:51:11,802
They will, I know they will.

701
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:12,736
(grunting)

702
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,204
- Hey, what the hell.

703
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:15,873
- [Jagi] But I see your point.

704
00:51:15,873 --> 00:51:17,708
After all, why  should I be robbed

705
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:20,010
of the pleasure of killing you myself.

706
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,346
The rest of you guard  the girl and her brother.

707
00:51:22,346 --> 00:51:24,148
I'll take care of them later.

708
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:29,453
- Is that panic I hear in your voice?

709
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:31,588
Don't worry, it'll  all be over soon.

710
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:45,102
- [Jagi] Now I'm going to make you suffer like I have.

711
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,870
- What you have suffered is nothing

712
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:49,606
compared to the suffering  you've caused others.

713
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,041
- You're wrong, brother.

714
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:54,178
No one has known  pain like I have.

715
00:51:54,178 --> 00:51:58,382
Intense never ending pain and it's all thanks to you.

716
00:51:59,817 --> 00:52:03,220
The only reason I had to  go on living was revenge.

717
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,124
- Jagi, why did youthrow me over the cliff

718
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,860
instead of finishing me off when you had the chance.

719
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,395
- That was a mistake.

720
00:52:11,395 --> 00:52:14,231
I should never have listened to Raoh.

721
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:15,165
- What do you mean?

722
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:17,601
- Raoh believed  that you'd been so

723
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:19,503
badly wounded in your fight with Shin

724
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:22,506
that you wouldn't recover  or be able to fight again.

725
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:24,742
Besides killing a  helpless cripple

726
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:26,043
wouldn't have been much fun,

727
00:52:26,043 --> 00:52:29,113
not nearly as much as I'm going to have now.

728
00:52:29,113 --> 00:52:31,348
(grunting)

729
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:35,853
- Come on.

730
00:52:35,853 --> 00:52:38,522
(loud grunting)

731
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:51,001
(groaning)

732
00:52:57,641 --> 00:53:01,145
Go ahead, use your gunif you think it'll help.

733
00:53:01,145 --> 00:53:03,514
- [Jagi] You think I won't, just watch.

734
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:05,716
- You know, sometimes a blow like that

735
00:53:05,716 --> 00:53:07,818
can affect your muscle control.

736
00:53:07,818 --> 00:53:09,853
If I were you, I'd get rid of that gun.

737
00:53:11,455 --> 00:53:14,224
(grunting)

738
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:15,559
(gun firing)

739
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,628
- [Jagi] You've changed, haven't you?

740
00:53:17,628 --> 00:53:19,963
You're a lot stronger and trickier too.

741
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:21,865
But I've got some  tricks of my own.

742
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:26,370
(laughing)

743
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,873
(explosion booming)

744
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,041
Come on, brother.

745
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,976
Let's see if you're fireproof too.

746
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:41,385
- Your time has run out.

747
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:43,120
Farewell, brother.

748
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:46,490
- (chuckling) But there's  so much you don't know.

749
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:50,661
Why do you think your old friend, Shin

750
00:53:50,661 --> 00:53:54,498
turned on you and  took your woman?

751
00:53:54,498 --> 00:53:59,136
Didn't you ever wonder about his sudden change of heart?

752
00:53:59,136 --> 00:54:02,606
He once thought that Juliacould never love anyone but you

753
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:05,909
until I convinced him otherwise.

754
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,045
Julia made me swear not to tell you,

755
00:54:08,045 --> 00:54:09,947
but I want what's best for her.

756
00:54:09,947 --> 00:54:13,183
After all, I love her like  she was my own sister.

757
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:16,086
In her heart of hearts you're the one she's in love with.

758
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:19,323
She doesn't care abouthim anymore, believe me.

759
00:54:19,323 --> 00:54:21,258
Besides who's going to protect her.

760
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,193
In times like these only the strongest

761
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:24,761
can protect the ones they love.

762
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,498
Ken's not as strong as you are.

763
00:54:27,498 --> 00:54:29,466
You're the one who  can keep her safe.

764
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:31,235
You're the one she loves.

765
00:54:31,235 --> 00:54:32,769
She wants you, Shin.

766
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,671
She wants you with  all her heart.

767
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:36,340
She belongs to you.

768
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:38,275
She's yours, so take her,

769
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,810
take her now.

770
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:41,845
- So it was you all along.

771
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:43,447
- [Jagi] Clever, wasn't it?

772
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:46,016
Your old friend,faithful and trustworthy

773
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:47,851
who never thought  of betraying you

774
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:50,587
until I turned him into  your most dangerous enemy.

775
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:53,457
(laughing)

776
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:55,225
Poor, poor Ken.

777
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:03,800
You've lost your woman.

778
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,735
You've lost your friend,

779
00:55:04,735 --> 00:55:06,470
and now you'll lose your life.

780
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:09,506
For I am the true Fist of the North Star.

781
00:55:20,217 --> 00:55:22,886
(loud grunting)

782
00:55:30,294 --> 00:55:32,629
(screaming)

783
00:55:33,864 --> 00:55:36,099
(rumbling)

784
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,745
(grunting)

785
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:59,523
(grunting)

786
00:56:11,168 --> 00:56:13,937
(grunting)

787
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:17,374
- You don't seem to understand that you're a dead man.

788
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:20,043
(loud grunting)

789
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:29,086
(groaning)

790
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:34,925
(screaming)

791
00:56:46,837 --> 00:56:48,939
Julia, where is she?

792
00:56:48,939 --> 00:56:50,474
- She's with Shin  at his fortress

793
00:56:50,474 --> 00:56:52,142
just below the southern front.

794
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:53,810
Oh, help.

795
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:56,613
- Help, you dareask me for help.

796
00:56:56,613 --> 00:56:59,549
I never realized what an idiot you really are, Jagi.

797
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:01,151
- You're the idiot.

798
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:05,455
You've lost everything,you fool, everything.

799
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:07,991
Yes, admit it you've lost and I've won.

800
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:10,794
I'm the Fist of the North Star.

801
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:11,628
You're nothing, nothing.

802
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:12,462
Do you hear?

803
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:13,697
(laughing)

804
00:57:13,697 --> 00:57:15,399
Just ask anyone  they'll tell you.

805
00:57:15,399 --> 00:57:19,803
Lord Jagi is the one who (grunting).

806
00:57:21,238 --> 00:57:23,173
- Jagi, damn.

807
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:26,510
What a waste.

808
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:28,845
(screaming)

809
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:39,990
(screaming)

810
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:42,993
(breathing heavily)

811
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,896
- It's me, your brother Rei.

812
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:47,431
You all right?

813
00:57:47,431 --> 00:57:48,765
- I recognize your voice.

814
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:50,534
Oh, yes, I know you're my new master.

815
00:57:50,534 --> 00:57:51,868
What is your will, my lord?

816
00:57:54,338 --> 00:57:56,206
Tell me how may I please you.

817
00:57:57,341 --> 00:57:58,675
- No.

818
00:57:58,675 --> 00:57:59,943
Oh, no.

819
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:02,713
(water splashing)

820
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:13,223
(gasping)

821
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:14,224
Alei.

822
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:15,459
Alei.

823
00:58:15,459 --> 00:58:17,127
Ken, is she going  to be all right?

824
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:19,396
Will she ever know who I am?

825
00:58:19,396 --> 00:58:20,864
- Her memory will return,

826
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:22,999
but there's nothing I  can do for her blindness.

827
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,401
Her eyes haven't been injured.

828
00:58:24,401 --> 00:58:26,503
She just won't allow herself to see.

829
00:58:38,048 --> 00:58:39,149
Oh, Julia.

830
00:58:39,149 --> 00:58:41,318
(eerie ambient music)

831
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:42,152
Julia.

832
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:48,959
- Well, hello.

833
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:50,026
- Hello yourself.

834
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:52,562
- Ken, look.

835
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:55,899
(soft orchestral music)

836
00:58:57,434 --> 00:58:59,836
- Lynn, that's one of Julia's flowers.

837
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:00,637
- Uh-huh.

838
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:06,743
- Yes, I remember I was going to be married, wasn't I?

839
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:07,878
- That's right, Alei.

840
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:09,780
Go on what else can you recall.

841
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,181
- I had a brother.

842
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:12,816
His name was Rei, I think.

843
00:59:12,816 --> 00:59:13,950
- Rei is me.

844
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:15,452
Alei don't you know me?

845
00:59:15,452 --> 00:59:16,753
Come on look at me.

846
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:19,156
- No, if I look at you, you'll look at me

847
00:59:19,156 --> 00:59:22,259
and you'll see all the  horrible things I've done.

848
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:24,127
(soft sobbing)

849
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:24,961
- Alei.

850
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:30,767
I don't know how to help her.

851
00:59:32,369 --> 00:59:34,738
She says she can't  open her eyes.

852
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:37,674
- [Alei] Too much pain,too much suffering.

853
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:39,009
- I know what you mean.

854
00:59:39,009 --> 00:59:40,710
The world's a pretty ugly place right now,

855
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:42,612
and what's left isn't worth seeing.

856
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:45,816
- Death everywhere I can't  look at anymore death.

857
00:59:45,816 --> 00:59:47,050
- Feeling sorry for yourself

858
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:48,485
isn't gonna make  things grow again.

859
00:59:48,485 --> 00:59:50,320
It's gonna take a  lot of hard work.

860
00:59:51,188 --> 00:59:52,656
- Lynn.

861
00:59:52,656 --> 00:59:54,124
- When a bear is fast  asleep in the winter time,

862
00:59:54,124 --> 00:59:56,126
it may look like he's dead, but he's not.

863
00:59:56,126 --> 00:59:58,395
When spring comes, he wakes up full of life,

864
00:59:58,395 --> 01:00:01,765
and the Earth can too if we allwork together to wake it up.

865
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:04,067
Just reach out and I'll prove it to you.

866
01:00:05,669 --> 01:00:06,503
- All right.

867
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:10,273
It's a flower and it's blooming.

868
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,908
It's a real flower.

869
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:14,511
I never thought I'd see a flower again.

870
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:18,348
- Alei, if you wanna see it,

871
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:20,050
you gotta open your eyes.

872
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:23,386
(soft orchestral music)

873
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:30,527
(gasping)

874
01:00:32,696 --> 01:00:36,533
- [Alei] It'sbeautiful, so beautiful.

875
01:00:36,533 --> 01:00:39,102
(soft sobbing)

876
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:03,560
(wind blowing swiftly)

877
01:01:36,092 --> 01:01:39,596
(gentle orchestral music)

878
01:01:53,944 --> 01:01:57,247
(footsteps approaching)

879
01:02:09,593 --> 01:02:12,529
- Julia, so beautiful as always.

880
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:22,138
Why, why do you refuse to accept my gifts

881
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:25,175
when other women would sell their souls to possess them?

882
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:28,912
- Just as you would do anything to possess me

883
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:31,247
if only I were willing to allow it.

884
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,350
You say that you love me

885
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:36,119
even though you know I feel nothing for you.

886
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:40,056
Must both our lives be wasted needless and unhappy.

887
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:45,061
- Given time people can  change, even you someday.

888
01:02:46,229 --> 01:02:47,497
You talk about your life being wasted,

889
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:48,765
but you're the one  who's wasting it.

890
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,367
You're in love with a ghost, a phantom.

891
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,435
Ken is dead and all your tears and prayers

892
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:53,903
and hope won't bring him back.

893
01:02:55,472 --> 01:02:57,807
- Liar, if Ken were dead I'd know it.

894
01:02:57,807 --> 01:02:59,109
The Earth is dying.

895
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:00,510
It must be brought back to life.

896
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:02,145
- Bring the Earth back to life

897
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:05,382
why try it's a waste of time, impossible.

898
01:03:05,382 --> 01:03:10,053
Listen, Julia, this town is one of the few places left.

899
01:03:10,053 --> 01:03:12,088
You can eat what you grow.

900
01:03:13,523 --> 01:03:15,625
It's the only place for  thousands of miles around

901
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,727
where the soil is fertile  enough to grow crops

902
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:19,729
and the water is pure enough to drink.

903
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:22,098
The poison winds which wind around the world

904
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:24,834
pass over the graveyards that were once called cities

905
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:27,771
and then move on to contaminatethe rest of the Earth.

906
01:03:27,771 --> 01:03:29,806
Unless nature can heal her own wounds,

907
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,107
there's no way to stop it.

908
01:03:33,076 --> 01:03:35,245
Eventually, it will all be gone.

909
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:41,484
The plants, the animals, the people

910
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:44,854
the cities, not a trace of life,

911
01:03:44,854 --> 01:03:48,091
nothing but a dead and barren ball of rock

912
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:49,426
spinning through space.

913
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:54,264
Julia, when there is no future,

914
01:03:54,264 --> 01:03:56,599
we must take what we canbefore it's too late.

915
01:03:58,134 --> 01:04:01,004
- [Rei] This girl you've been looking for, what's her name?

916
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:01,838
- Julia.

917
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:09,546
- Julia, she has a lovely name.

918
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:11,648
- We had planned to get married

919
01:04:11,648 --> 01:04:13,249
and spent the rest of our lives together

920
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:14,718
spreading the seeds of life

921
01:04:14,718 --> 01:04:17,754
wherever they grow to make  the Earth green again.

922
01:04:17,754 --> 01:04:20,490
I love her, Rei, and youcan't imagine how much.

923
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,893
- I believe that your separation from Julia

924
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:26,863
must be linked to the ultimate fulfillment of your destiny.

925
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:31,367
Fate's plan in which wemust all play a part.

926
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:34,604
I have a hunch that yourroles an important one.

927
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:36,106
(groaning)

928
01:04:36,106 --> 01:04:38,408
I wouldn't be surprisedif the world needs you

929
01:04:38,408 --> 01:04:40,744
even more than you need Julia.

930
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:44,948
- Whatever I was destined  to do in this world

931
01:04:44,948 --> 01:04:47,117
will have to waituntil I get Julia back.

932
01:04:47,117 --> 01:04:49,185
Right now that's  all that matters.

933
01:04:56,493 --> 01:04:58,762
- I have no idea what  fate has in store for you,

934
01:04:58,762 --> 01:05:00,964
but you must remainopen to any possibility.

935
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:22,519
(dramatic orchestral music)

936
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:34,264
- Listen, give up while you still can

937
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:37,033
or every one you men  shall die, I promise you.

938
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:41,571
Raoh, you call yourselfRaoh the Conquerer

939
01:05:41,571 --> 01:05:43,439
and King of the World.

940
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,975
Call yourself Emperor ofthe Galaxy if you like,

941
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:49,646
but you'll never defeat me or possess an acre of my land.

942
01:05:49,646 --> 01:05:54,651
If you try, you and your entire army will be destroyed.

943
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:56,252
- Sir, forward.

944
01:06:01,758 --> 01:06:03,193
(loud grunting)

945
01:06:03,193 --> 01:06:04,394
- Destroy them.

946
01:06:04,394 --> 01:06:07,797
(tense orchestral music)

947
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:12,502
(men grunting)

948
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:31,321
Now they die.

949
01:06:43,399 --> 01:06:46,436
(grunting)

950
01:06:46,436 --> 01:06:48,872
I've turned my body to steel.

951
01:06:48,872 --> 01:06:52,742
Now I'll crush Raoh's troops as if they were insects

952
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:55,245
and send Raoh to burn in hell.

953
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:00,617
(grunting)

954
01:07:00,617 --> 01:07:01,818
(chuckling)

955
01:07:01,818 --> 01:07:03,019
Do they really think they can hurt me

956
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,421
with those pretty little swords of air.

957
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:07,690
(grunting)

958
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:12,328
(chuckling)Come now, Raoh.

959
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:14,664
Is that the best you can do?

960
01:07:16,099 --> 01:07:17,400
- Attack.

961
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,401
(men grunting)

962
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:21,137
(soft chuckling)

963
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:34,751
(screaming)

964
01:07:36,586 --> 01:07:38,855
(laughing)

965
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:53,436
- Why sacrifice more of your men, Raoh,

966
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:56,572
or are you afraid to face me yourself?

967
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,975
I promise not to hurt  your pretty little horse.

968
01:07:58,975 --> 01:08:00,109
(laughing)

969
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:01,644
- You fool.

970
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:03,947
The king doesn't dirty his  hands fighting with scum.

971
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:08,584
- So I'm scum, am I?

972
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:12,388
Die, pig.

973
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:15,959
You think breaking my sword's gonna scare me away.

974
01:08:15,959 --> 01:08:17,393
Guess again, Raoh.

975
01:08:20,296 --> 01:08:22,532
(grunting)

976
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,168
(groaning)

977
01:08:25,168 --> 01:08:27,971
I don't know what  you hit me with,

978
01:08:27,971 --> 01:08:31,708
ah, but it won'tdo you any good.

979
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:33,810
You're still gonna die.

980
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:38,281
Hey, why you waving yourhand around like that?

981
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:40,316
You think I believe in magic or something.

982
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:42,685
Just what kind of fool do you take me for.

983
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:46,356
(dramatic orchestral music)

984
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:49,726
(screaming)

985
01:08:54,897 --> 01:08:57,233
(groaning)

986
01:08:57,233 --> 01:09:00,436
Now you really made me mad, asshole.

987
01:09:02,538 --> 01:09:05,274
(loud screaming)

988
01:09:06,676 --> 01:09:09,045
(screaming)

989
01:09:09,045 --> 01:09:10,346
- Wait and go round up the others,

990
01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:12,382
and destroy them as quickly as possible.

991
01:09:12,382 --> 01:09:14,817
We leave at first light.

992
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:16,819
(soft music)

993
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,287
- [Shin] I must leave, Julia.

994
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:20,289
I'm not sure for how long.

995
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:23,059
Raoh's a madman trying to provethat he's king of the world.

996
01:09:23,059 --> 01:09:25,161
His army's are ravagingwhat's little is left,

997
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,629
and I have to stop him.

998
01:09:26,629 --> 01:09:28,231
- I wish you luck, naturally.

999
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:30,967
- How incredibly  touching, my love.

1000
01:09:30,967 --> 01:09:33,569
Rarely have I heard suchheartfelt sentiment.

1001
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:35,605
- Sir, excuse me, sir

1002
01:09:35,605 --> 01:09:38,541
but Raoh and his forces are approaching the out perimeter.

1003
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:42,245
- Already, he is movingfaster than I expected,

1004
01:09:42,245 --> 01:09:43,646
but I'm ready for him.

1005
01:09:43,646 --> 01:09:45,214
- Sir, one more thing.

1006
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:46,716
We've learned that  Jagi the Pretender

1007
01:09:46,716 --> 01:09:48,418
was killed a couple of days ago.

1008
01:09:48,418 --> 01:09:49,852
- Hmm?

1009
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:51,821
- His brother Ken, the real Fist of the North Star

1010
01:09:51,821 --> 01:09:53,623
is the one that said to have killed him.

1011
01:09:53,623 --> 01:09:54,457
(dramatic tone)

1012
01:09:54,457 --> 01:09:55,291
- He's alive.

1013
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:59,796
(gentle orchestral music)

1014
01:09:59,796 --> 01:10:02,865
When I thought Ken was dead, my heart turned to ice,

1015
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:06,903
and I've been a walking corpse ever since, but no longer.

1016
01:10:06,903 --> 01:10:08,171
Ken is alive.

1017
01:10:08,171 --> 01:10:10,640
I've got to find  him, I've got to.

1018
01:10:33,129 --> 01:10:35,798
(soft grunting)

1019
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,776
(grunting)

1020
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:02,258
- Where is Julia?

1021
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,459
Search the palace  till she's found.

1022
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:05,394
- Yes, stay on guard and keep alert.

1023
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:06,896
- Captain, have you seen Julia?

1024
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:09,365
- I'm sorry, sir, there's no time to look for her now.

1025
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:11,367
The outer perimeter's been breached.

1026
01:11:11,367 --> 01:11:13,302
- No time for Julia, is that right?

1027
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:14,604
- No, sir, I didn't mean that.

1028
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:16,339
I was merely trying to (groaning).

1029
01:11:16,339 --> 01:11:17,607
- No time.

1030
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:20,009
Lieutenant, take 100 men off guard duty.

1031
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:21,277
- [Man] Sir.

1032
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:23,179
- Bring Julia to me as soon as you find her.

1033
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:44,634
(dramatic orchestral music)

1034
01:12:12,295 --> 01:12:14,463
(gasping)

1035
01:12:20,136 --> 01:12:22,371
(grunting)

1036
01:12:28,778 --> 01:12:30,947
(gasping)

1037
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,188
- Raoh, he's close,

1038
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:40,690
very close, I can feel him.

1039
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:43,359
Welcome.

1040
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:44,627
You kill me.

1041
01:12:44,627 --> 01:12:45,895
I kill you.

1042
01:12:45,895 --> 01:12:48,764
We destroy each other, what does it matter.

1043
01:12:49,599 --> 01:12:50,433
Let it begin.

1044
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:00,810
Raoh, I presume.

1045
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:04,814
- It's all mine and your woman too.

1046
01:13:04,814 --> 01:13:05,715
- Huh?

1047
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:08,484
(soft chuckling)

1048
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:13,589
- You came a long way just  to steal a woman, Raoh.

1049
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:15,625
I recall reading something  about ancient Greeks

1050
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:18,527
who did that once, but Inever finished the book.

1051
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:20,029
Let's get on with it.

1052
01:13:20,029 --> 01:13:23,065
- All right, if you're that eager to die, I'll oblige you.

1053
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:24,400
Anytime you're ready.

1054
01:13:25,368 --> 01:13:26,302
- Your move.

1055
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:30,473
(wind blowing swiftly)

1056
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:38,080
(gentle orchestral music)

1057
01:14:10,413 --> 01:14:13,749
- Shin's fortress  is on fire, Julia.

1058
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:17,186
(tense orchestral music)

1059
01:14:30,533 --> 01:14:33,869
(footsteps approaching)

1060
01:14:55,191 --> 01:14:58,361
(gentle orchestral music)

1061
01:14:58,361 --> 01:14:59,462
Shin.

1062
01:14:59,462 --> 01:15:00,363
- Hello, Ken.

1063
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:02,698
How nice to see you again.

1064
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:04,300
How have you been?

1065
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,135
- [Ken] I've been better.

1066
01:15:06,135 --> 01:15:07,269
Where's Julia?

1067
01:15:08,137 --> 01:15:09,372
- She's not here right now.

1068
01:15:09,372 --> 01:15:10,806
Would you like to  leave a message?

1069
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:12,174
- Very funny.

1070
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,109
Afraid I'm not in the mood

1071
01:15:13,109 --> 01:15:15,644
for your twisted sense of humor.

1072
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:16,812
Now where is she?

1073
01:15:18,714 --> 01:15:20,683
- I thought you'd  ask that question.

1074
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:23,319
I wish I knew, Ken, honestly I do.

1075
01:15:23,319 --> 01:15:24,887
- [Ken] Answer me dammit.

1076
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:26,188
- But then we wouldn't fight,

1077
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:28,224
and we're destined to do that.

1078
01:15:28,224 --> 01:15:31,894
(dramatic orchestral music)

1079
01:15:36,599 --> 01:15:38,601
If I'd known you'd  improved so much,

1080
01:15:38,601 --> 01:15:40,436
I would have trained for this fight.

1081
01:15:40,436 --> 01:15:41,837
- I don't wanna hurt you, Shin,

1082
01:15:41,837 --> 01:15:43,739
but you've left no choice (screaming).

1083
01:15:50,513 --> 01:15:52,815
- Well, done, Ken, well done.

1084
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:55,985
(grunting)

1085
01:16:02,425 --> 01:16:04,360
- Now tell me, where is she?

1086
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,896
- As usual you're a little bit late, Ken.

1087
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:08,397
(spitting)

1088
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:10,766
I couldn't make her happy, Ken no matter how hard I tried.

1089
01:16:12,201 --> 01:16:15,004
She could've had it all, you know, anything she wanted.

1090
01:16:15,004 --> 01:16:18,307
I gave her everything  and got nothing in return

1091
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:20,109
not a spark not a glimmer

1092
01:16:20,109 --> 01:16:22,611
because you were there standing in my way.

1093
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:23,813
- Shin, where is she?

1094
01:16:23,813 --> 01:16:25,080
Tell me.

1095
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:29,718
(somber orchestral music)  (grunting)

1096
01:16:34,924 --> 01:16:36,826
- This was to be Julia's wedding dress.

1097
01:16:36,826 --> 01:16:38,894
It took 10 seamstressesa year to make it.

1098
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:41,931
But of course she'll never wearit now that she's gone away.

1099
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:43,466
- She's gone.

1100
01:16:43,466 --> 01:16:47,803
- Oh, yes, far, far away with Raoh.

1101
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:49,004
- Where, Shin?

1102
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:50,406
- Oh, you should've seen them, Ken.

1103
01:16:50,406 --> 01:16:52,842
Raoh the Conquerer, a brother you could be proud of

1104
01:16:52,842 --> 01:16:54,510
if he weren't such a monster.

1105
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:56,178
- Where have they gone?

1106
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:58,914
- Well, hey, our love has gone away.

1107
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:00,349
Out of the light

1108
01:17:00,349 --> 01:17:03,085
(grunting)

1109
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:04,520
into the darkness.

1110
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,989
- Out of the light, what do you mean?

1111
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:09,158
- The dungeons of  Cassandra are the

1112
01:17:09,158 --> 01:17:11,594
deepest pits of darkness in the world.

1113
01:17:11,594 --> 01:17:14,797
- Cassandra, why would he take her there?

1114
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:18,000
- He's built a fortress over the ruins of the old city.

1115
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,368
They say its impregnable,

1116
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:22,004
and the dungeon's escape proof.

1117
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:24,607
If only I could have made her love me for an instant.

1118
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:26,308
(loud grunting)

1119
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:27,142
- Shin.

1120
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,986
(somber orchestral music)

1121
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:41,156
- To die by your hand only one who loves her as much as--

1122
01:18:00,142 --> 01:18:02,578
- [Ken] You loved her even  more than I did, Shin.

1123
01:18:02,578 --> 01:18:06,048
No one can love or hate with more passion than a madman.

1124
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:21,664
- [Crowd] King Raoh.

1125
01:18:21,664 --> 01:18:22,498
King Raoh.

1126
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:24,667
King Raoh.

1127
01:18:25,801 --> 01:18:27,002
King Raoh.

1128
01:18:27,937 --> 01:18:29,171
King Raoh.

1129
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:31,307
King Raoh.

1130
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:35,010
- Louder, you ungrateful wretches.

1131
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:36,478
I cannot hear you.

1132
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:40,482
Let the king know how much you appreciate all he's done.

1133
01:18:40,482 --> 01:18:41,717
You're supposed to say it

1134
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:44,553
along with everyone else, understand?

1135
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:45,421
- [Crowd] Raoh.

1136
01:18:45,421 --> 01:18:46,255
King Raoh.

1137
01:18:47,356 --> 01:18:49,325
- [Man] Now let's hear it.

1138
01:18:49,325 --> 01:18:51,260
- [Crowd] King Raoh.

1139
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:52,094
King Raoh.

1140
01:18:53,028 --> 01:18:53,862
King Raoh.

1141
01:18:54,964 --> 01:18:55,798
King Raoh.

1142
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:58,734
King Raoh.

1143
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:00,903
King Raoh.

1144
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:03,072
King Raoh.

1145
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:05,307
King Raoh.

1146
01:19:06,642 --> 01:19:07,476
King Raoh.

1147
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:09,712
King Raoh.

1148
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:11,814
King Raoh.

1149
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:13,916
King Raoh.

1150
01:19:15,384 --> 01:19:16,218
King Raoh.

1151
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:21,523
- Raoh the Conqueror, pretty impressive.

1152
01:19:21,523 --> 01:19:24,994
- Hot damn, I want  a closer look.

1153
01:19:24,994 --> 01:19:26,562
- Wait, I wanna go too.

1154
01:19:26,562 --> 01:19:27,496
- Don't go far,

1155
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:28,564
and be careful out there.

1156
01:19:28,564 --> 01:19:29,398
- Hey.

1157
01:19:33,369 --> 01:19:36,305
I can't see a thing from here.

1158
01:19:36,305 --> 01:19:37,573
- Wow, far out.

1159
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:42,511
- [Crowd] King Raoh.

1160
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:44,046
- [Man] Hey.

1161
01:19:44,046 --> 01:19:44,880
- [Crowd] King Raoh.

1162
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,081
- Oh.

1163
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:48,484
- [Crowd] King Raoh.

1164
01:19:48,484 --> 01:19:49,318
King Raoh.

1165
01:19:50,853 --> 01:19:51,687
King Raoh.

1166
01:19:53,022 --> 01:19:53,856
King Raoh.

1167
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:56,125
King Raoh.

1168
01:19:57,726 --> 01:19:58,560
King Raoh.

1169
01:19:59,928 --> 01:20:00,763
King Raoh.

1170
01:20:07,269 --> 01:20:09,538
- That presence, who is it?

1171
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:12,608
- [Crowd] King Raoh.

1172
01:20:12,608 --> 01:20:13,442
King Raoh.

1173
01:20:14,343 --> 01:20:17,846
(high pitch tone ringing)

1174
01:20:29,725 --> 01:20:31,894
(gasping)

1175
01:20:33,962 --> 01:20:37,466
(horse braying)

1176
01:20:37,466 --> 01:20:39,168
- [Crowd] King Raoh.

1177
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:39,968
King Raoh.

1178
01:20:41,303 --> 01:20:42,104
King Raoh.

1179
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:44,306
King Raoh.

1180
01:20:45,474 --> 01:20:46,275
King Raoh.

1181
01:20:47,976 --> 01:20:48,777
King Raoh.

1182
01:20:49,878 --> 01:20:51,747
- You don't scare me, nah.

1183
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:56,719
- [Crowd] King Raoh.

1184
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:57,519
King Raoh.

1185
01:20:58,887 --> 01:20:59,688
King Raoh.

1186
01:21:01,023 --> 01:21:01,857
King Raoh.

1187
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:06,061
- That's Julia, it's got be her,

1188
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:08,330
but what's she doing here?

1189
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:10,132
- [Crowd] King Raoh.

1190
01:21:10,132 --> 01:21:10,966
King Raoh.

1191
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:13,369
King Raoh.

1192
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:20,175
(rumbling)

1193
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:31,553
- So now they call me Raoh  the Conqueror, why not?

1194
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:34,389
Every one of my enemieshas been annihilated,

1195
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:36,392
all but one, the most dangerous,

1196
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:38,761
the one I wish most to destroy.

1197
01:21:38,761 --> 01:21:40,295
But the woman will bring him,

1198
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:43,632
and then he shall die like  all the others before him.

1199
01:21:43,632 --> 01:21:45,968
(whooshing)

1200
01:21:56,612 --> 01:21:59,314
- That was Julia, are you sure?

1201
01:21:59,314 --> 01:22:00,382
- [Rei] From the way Ken described her

1202
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:03,051
it had to be, I'm sure of it.

1203
01:22:03,051 --> 01:22:05,020
- Lynn, it couldn't have been.

1204
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:06,054
She's with Shin.

1205
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:11,226
- I'm telling ya there'sno doubt about it.

1206
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:13,295
I don't know why  she's not be Shin

1207
01:22:13,295 --> 01:22:16,031
or what she's doing here  but it was her all right.

1208
01:22:16,031 --> 01:22:18,133
- Listen, Bat, if Lynn'scertain Julia's here

1209
01:22:18,133 --> 01:22:19,968
then we have to take her word for it.

1210
01:22:21,170 --> 01:22:23,572
- Yep, she's never wrongabout things like that.

1211
01:22:23,572 --> 01:22:25,174
Well, come on then, let's fly.

1212
01:22:25,174 --> 01:22:26,775
We'll pay her a visit.

1213
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:27,976
- That palace is huge.

1214
01:22:27,976 --> 01:22:29,244
How will we find her?

1215
01:22:29,244 --> 01:22:31,113
Look it's obviousshe's a prisoner, right

1216
01:22:31,113 --> 01:22:33,549
and prisoners are kept in the dungeon.

1217
01:22:33,549 --> 01:22:34,883
- Uh-huh.

1218
01:22:34,883 --> 01:22:36,218
- And if there's  one thing I know,

1219
01:22:36,218 --> 01:22:38,187
it's that every dungeonhas a secret entrance

1220
01:22:38,187 --> 01:22:40,255
that someone like  me can get into.

1221
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:41,557
I'm right, right?

1222
01:22:42,758 --> 01:22:44,426
The first thing we gotta do is figure out

1223
01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:45,961
the source of the water supply.

1224
01:22:47,196 --> 01:22:50,265
It must come from underground, that's obvious.

1225
01:22:50,265 --> 01:22:52,501
That's the only way the  factories in the old city

1226
01:22:52,501 --> 01:22:55,137
would've had enough water pressure to run all the machinery.

1227
01:22:55,137 --> 01:22:57,005
Now if we look at the regional topography

1228
01:22:57,005 --> 01:22:59,074
as well as local geological--

1229
01:22:59,074 --> 01:23:00,776
It would be safer if you stayed here.

1230
01:23:00,776 --> 01:23:02,644
Besides we're not certain you saw her.

1231
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:04,079
It could have been  somebody else.

1232
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:06,815
- I already know it's Julia, and she's awfully sad.

1233
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:08,617
That's why I'm bringingher this flower, Bat.

1234
01:23:08,617 --> 01:23:09,952
She needs some cheering up.

1235
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:22,631
(soft grunting)

1236
01:23:22,631 --> 01:23:23,565
(grunting)

1237
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:24,800
- We've got a problem.

1238
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,968
That door is rusted shut.

1239
01:23:25,968 --> 01:23:27,202
It won't budge an inch.

1240
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:28,704
- [Lynn] Never mind, I got it.

1241
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:31,673
- All right, Lynn, way to go.

1242
01:23:47,823 --> 01:23:49,091
- Julia.

1243
01:23:49,091 --> 01:23:52,427
(soft orchestral music)

1244
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:00,769
- Oh, is it real?

1245
01:24:00,769 --> 01:24:01,803
Where did it come from?

1246
01:24:01,803 --> 01:24:03,372
- From you, sort of.

1247
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:04,873
- Me?

1248
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:06,608
- [Lynn] You see, I grew it from the seed you gave to Ken,

1249
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:07,943
and he gave to me.

1250
01:24:07,943 --> 01:24:12,748
- Incredible, it's  lovely, so lovely.

1251
01:24:15,117 --> 01:24:16,385
- Don't you worry.

1252
01:24:16,385 --> 01:24:19,254
Ken's gonna get you outof here, I know he will.

1253
01:24:19,254 --> 01:24:21,356
- No, you must tell himnot to come near here.

1254
01:24:21,356 --> 01:24:22,524
- What do you mean?

1255
01:24:22,524 --> 01:24:25,027
- If he comes here he'll die.

1256
01:24:25,027 --> 01:24:26,228
Don't you understand?

1257
01:24:26,228 --> 01:24:28,530
It's exactly what Raoh wants him to do.

1258
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:29,765
I'm the bait in his trap,

1259
01:24:29,765 --> 01:24:31,867
and if Ken comes here Raoh will kill him.

1260
01:24:31,867 --> 01:24:34,736
- [Bat] But Julia Ken has no reason to be afraid of Raoh.

1261
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:35,570
He's just a--

1262
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:36,505
(footsteps approaching)

1263
01:24:36,505 --> 01:24:38,140
- You must go and quickly.

1264
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:39,341
- We'll find away.

1265
01:24:39,341 --> 01:24:40,175
- Let's go.

1266
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:43,445
- We've got to.

1267
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:46,715
(footsteps approaching)

1268
01:24:46,715 --> 01:24:50,385
(dramatic orchestral music)

1269
01:25:01,897 --> 01:25:02,831
- Who's it from?

1270
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:03,665
Tell me.

1271
01:25:05,033 --> 01:25:08,470
Without light it will diequickly as all living things do.

1272
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:10,639
But the one who brought it

1273
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:13,308
will die slowly, very slowly indeed.

1274
01:25:13,308 --> 01:25:16,979
(dramatic orchestral music)

1275
01:25:27,689 --> 01:25:29,358
- Behold this flower.

1276
01:25:33,628 --> 01:25:36,398
(people gasping)

1277
01:25:37,532 --> 01:25:40,302
- My, god I can see a living flower.

1278
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:43,372
- No way it couldn't be a  flower, there'll all dead.

1279
01:25:45,874 --> 01:25:49,578
- There are no flowers allowed in Lord Raoh's kingdom.

1280
01:25:49,578 --> 01:25:51,313
A crime has been committed.

1281
01:25:52,681 --> 01:25:54,349
The criminal will come forward,

1282
01:25:55,384 --> 01:25:58,253
or this woman will die.

1283
01:25:58,253 --> 01:26:00,155
- No, I won't let them hurt her.

1284
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:05,160
- Don't worry she won't be hurt.

1285
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:12,968
Raoh, I'm the one you're looking for.

1286
01:26:12,968 --> 01:26:14,770
I take full responsibility.

1287
01:26:16,905 --> 01:26:18,907
Add to my list of crimes my friendship

1288
01:26:18,907 --> 01:26:21,176
with the one called Fist of the North Star

1289
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:23,178
and with the woman named Julia.

1290
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,947
- Well, imagine that, I'm impressed.

1291
01:26:25,947 --> 01:26:28,550
- I grew that flower for Julia

1292
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:31,953
from the seeds which shegave me along time ago.

1293
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:37,125
- Flowers inspire hope and hope is unhealthy.

1294
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:38,794
You fool, Uygle.

1295
01:26:40,095 --> 01:26:43,832
- Sir, hey you, stay where you are.

1296
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:48,537
By committing this crime you've displeased King Raoh

1297
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:50,972
and must be punished accordingly.

1298
01:26:50,972 --> 01:26:54,876
- I'm not here to waste my timefighting with an underling.

1299
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:57,979
My fight is with Raoh the  Conquerer and no one else.

1300
01:26:57,979 --> 01:26:59,514
- You upstart (grunting).

1301
01:27:07,589 --> 01:27:09,091
(soft chuckling)

1302
01:27:09,091 --> 01:27:10,325
Uh, what the hell?

1303
01:27:10,325 --> 01:27:11,827
- Raoh, your man's skill with the lash

1304
01:27:11,827 --> 01:27:13,195
leaves much to be desired.

1305
01:27:13,195 --> 01:27:15,030
Give me someone worthy to fight.

1306
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:19,935
- You miserable mound of dung (chuckling).

1307
01:27:24,606 --> 01:27:26,908
- You think you can take me then come on.

1308
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:28,977
(grunting)

1309
01:27:28,977 --> 01:27:31,379
- I'll slice you into dog meat.

1310
01:27:39,688 --> 01:27:42,357
- All right, Raoh, now it's your turn.

1311
01:27:42,357 --> 01:27:43,425
(grunting)

1312
01:27:43,425 --> 01:27:44,893
- We're not through yet.

1313
01:27:44,893 --> 01:27:46,428
(screaming)

1314
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:49,698
- Well, seems I'm going to haveto fight you after all, Rei.

1315
01:27:49,698 --> 01:27:51,666
One can't fight one's destiny.

1316
01:27:52,901 --> 01:27:57,472
- Rei, no.

1317
01:27:57,472 --> 01:28:00,108
(dramatic tone)

1318
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:15,290
- Lynn, take care of yourself.

1319
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:17,425
There's a whole world depending on you.

1320
01:28:18,827 --> 01:28:22,798
Now you, you've gotta die beforeyou can do anymore damage.

1321
01:28:24,232 --> 01:28:27,669
- No, Rei, I don't think that my time has come quite yet.

1322
01:28:29,104 --> 01:28:31,973
I still have a great many  things do before I die.

1323
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:34,409
In fact, killing you is one of them.

1324
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:36,077
- Then get off your horse, Raoh.

1325
01:28:36,077 --> 01:28:38,146
I'm ready, are you?

1326
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:41,383
- Yes, but I see no reason to dismount.

1327
01:28:41,383 --> 01:28:44,619
I believe I have a distinct advantage the way things are.

1328
01:28:44,619 --> 01:28:46,888
- Quit stalling, Raoh, come on.

1329
01:28:48,523 --> 01:28:49,858
- Death shouldn't be rushed.

1330
01:28:49,858 --> 01:28:51,760
One should saver  it like fine wine

1331
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,361
and enjoy its aroma.

1332
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:56,031
But if in consider of your impatience,

1333
01:28:56,031 --> 01:28:58,266
I must kill you now, so be it.

1334
01:28:58,266 --> 01:28:59,100
- Enough talk.

1335
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:00,368
Defend yourself, Raoh.

Is that any way to talkto your older brother?

1374
01:32:45,093 --> 01:32:47,595
You must learn to show me more respect.

See, it's different now.

1376

I'm a king,

Ken, fight 'em and  you both will die.

You'll kill each other until what end.

1381

Please, Ken, think  of the children,

01:33:35,376 --> 01:33:37,779
the innocent yet unborn,

1386
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:41,749
and think of the ones you love

1387
01:33:41,749 --> 01:33:45,453
and who love you anddepend on your strength.

1388
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:48,756
They too have a role to play in the new era of man.

1389
01:33:48,756 --> 01:33:50,625
Will they be able to survive

1390
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:52,260
without you to protect them?

1391
01:33:53,161 --> 01:33:55,430
And Julia, what if Julia,

1392
01:33:57,365 --> 01:33:59,267
she needs you so much.

1393
01:34:00,602 --> 01:34:03,571
Please, Ken, don't fight Raoh.

- Raoh the Conquerer, your time has come.

1400
01:34:44,312 --> 01:34:45,346
(chuckling)

1401
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:46,714
Come now, little brother.

1402
01:34:46,714 --> 01:34:48,550
After all, this time you must

1403
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:50,852
be able to do better than that.

1404
01:34:50,852 --> 01:34:52,720
Even your little slut, Julia,

1405
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:54,489
put up more of afight than this.

1406
01:34:54,489 --> 01:34:57,392
So did Ryuuken, our dear departed father.

1407
01:34:57,392 --> 01:34:58,927
He's dead, Ken, I killed him.

1408
01:34:58,927 --> 01:35:02,263
(tense orchestral music)

1409

Whoa.

1412
01:35:34,495 --> 01:35:35,663
Now I can see it.

1413
01:35:35,663 --> 01:35:38,433
Ken's aura is strong, very strong.

1414
01:35:38,433 --> 01:35:39,767
Come, little brother.

1415
01:35:39,767 --> 01:35:41,436
Having strength is one thing

1416
01:35:41,436 --> 01:35:43,638
but knowing how to  use it is another.

1417
01:36:00,254 --> 01:36:02,924

(Julia screaming)

1422
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:30,051
- [Kids] Julia.

1423
01:36:36,257 --> 01:36:37,091
- Look.

1424
01:36:49,837 --> 01:36:52,507

1429
01:37:36,517 --> 01:37:38,886
- You're better, much better.

1430
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:47,462
I had no idea how  far you'd come.

1431
01:37:47,462 --> 01:37:50,898
You're a very good fighter, exceptional in fact.

1432
01:37:52,033 --> 01:37:54,001
But you're no matchfor me, little brother,

1433
01:37:54,001 --> 01:37:55,436
and never will be.

1434

1439
01:38:17,191 --> 01:38:20,294
hereafter is a better world than this.

Now die damn you, die!

1453
01:41:11,999 --> 01:41:13,000
- No, don't!

1454
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:17,705
(soft orchestral music)

1455
01:41:30,318 --> 01:41:31,152
Please wait.

1456
01:41:31,152 --> 01:41:32,019
I've got to talk to you.

1457
01:41:32,019 --> 01:41:32,853
It's important.

1458
01:41:34,655 --> 01:41:37,258
Very well, what do you want?

1459
01:41:37,258 --> 01:41:39,627
To stop you from killing him.

1460
01:41:39,627 --> 01:41:41,462
To stop all this killing.

1461
01:41:41,462 --> 01:41:43,798
- Those who betray thefirst of the north star

1462
01:41:43,798 --> 01:41:45,132
deserve to die.

1463
01:41:48,135 --> 01:41:52,106
- [Man] Power without perceptionis spiritually useless

1464
01:41:52,106 --> 01:41:54,108
and therefore of no true value.

1465
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:56,410
- Ryuken.

1466
01:41:57,778 --> 01:42:00,414
You ask me to spare Ken's life, so be it.

1467
01:42:02,116 --> 01:42:05,586
Fate has entrusted him with a unique responsibility

1468
01:42:05,586 --> 01:42:09,523
The protection of someone on who the earth's future depends

1469
01:42:09,523 --> 01:42:10,791
Someone special.

1470
01:42:11,692 --> 01:42:12,526
You.

1471
01:42:17,765 --> 01:42:19,767
You have a responsibility, too.

1472
01:42:23,838 --> 01:42:27,174
He'll need looking after for a while, you needn't worry,

1473
01:42:27,174 --> 01:42:30,077
With his strength and alittle care his wounds

1474
01:42:30,077 --> 01:42:31,912
will heal before long.

1475
01:42:35,349 --> 01:42:37,618
(groaning)

1476
01:42:40,154 --> 01:42:42,423
If Ken wants to find me,

1477
01:42:42,423 --> 01:42:45,960
tell him I'll be at Ryuken's grave, paying my respects.

1478
01:42:47,228 --> 01:42:50,731
(bright orchestral music)

1479
01:43:22,196 --> 01:43:23,397
- [Bat] I wonder what happened to Ken.

1480
01:43:23,397 --> 01:43:25,766
- And Julia, I'm sure he'll find her.

1481
01:43:29,103 --> 01:43:30,738
He'll come back some day  and Julia will be with him

1482
01:43:30,738 --> 01:43:33,541
'cause I know he won't stop searching till he finds her.

1483
01:43:34,975 --> 01:43:36,277
Oh, look!

1484
01:43:36,277 --> 01:43:37,478
- Huh?

1485
01:43:37,478 --> 01:43:40,881
(grand orchestral music)

1486
01:43:42,983 --> 01:43:45,219
- [Bat] Are those what I think they are?

1487
01:43:45,219 --> 01:43:46,220
- Yes!

1488
01:43:48,923 --> 01:43:50,191
Flowers!

1489
01:43:50,191 --> 01:43:51,392
Flowers!

1490
01:43:51,392 --> 01:43:52,660
They're growing again.

1491
