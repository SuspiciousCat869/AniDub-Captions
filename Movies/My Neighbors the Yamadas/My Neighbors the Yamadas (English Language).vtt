Ah, good morning, Shige.

00:01:01.834 --> 00:01:05.604 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't think I've ever seen
such a magnificent specimen.

- [laughs] Oh, you are too kind.
- What species?

00:01:10.476 --> 00:01:13.712 position:21% line:83% align:start
Those there are Mino
chrysanthemums and these...

00:01:13.746 --> 00:01:15.848 position:19% line:83% align:start
- No, the caterpillar.
- Hm?

00:01:19.752 --> 00:01:21.888 position:35% line:89% align:start
Don't know.

00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:25.424 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't worry. Some day you'll
be as gaudy as that flower.

 <i>Yep, that's Grandma.</i>

00:01:27.493 --> 00:01:30.563 position:13% line:89% align:start

00:01:35.368 --> 00:01:37.270 position:27% line:89% align:start

 <i>Here's my mommy.</i>
 <i>And that's me, Nonoko.</i>

00:01:48.783 --> 00:01:52.887 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hm. What should I make
for dinner tonight?

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.789 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:01:56.422 --> 00:01:59.760 position:19% line:83% align:start
Enough. I'll go for it.
Something really great.

00:01:59.794 --> 00:02:03.831 position:10% line:83% align:start
- What are you going to make?
- We've had curry every night.

00:02:03.864 --> 00:02:06.433 position:7% line:89% align:start
So I'm thinking... more curry.

00:02:19.114 --> 00:02:22.516 position:27% line:83% align:start
This is my daddy
and older brother Noboru.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.719 position:27% line:83% align:start
Dad, do you think
all this studying

00:02:24.753 --> 00:02:26.855 position:16% line:89% align:start
is really worth my time?

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:30.392 position:35% line:89% align:start
Listen up.

00:02:30.425 --> 00:02:33.495 position:21% line:83% align:start
Studying is not about
what's worth it.

00:02:33.528 --> 00:02:37.499 position:13% line:83% align:start
Classes that seem worth it
may turn out to be not worth it,

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:40.002 position:10% line:89% align:start
and therefore not worthwhile.

00:02:40.036 --> 00:02:43.940 position:21% line:83% align:start
But sometimes things
that are worthless

00:02:43.973 --> 00:02:46.675 position:13% line:83% align:start
may actually be worthwhile,
worthless or not.

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.781 position:5% line:83% align:start
So it's not about whether or not
something is worthless or not.

00:02:51.814 --> 00:02:55.084 position:27% line:83% align:start
What in the world
are you talking about?

00:02:57.186 --> 00:03:00.556 position:10% line:89% align:start
Mm, that was so not worth it.

00:03:08.865 --> 00:03:10.733 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sings]

00:03:30.053 --> 00:03:31.922 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:36.928 position:24% line:83% align:start
So if Dad had been
handsome and really smart,

00:03:36.961 --> 00:03:41.565 position:5% line:83% align:start
and Mom had been truly beautiful
and a wonderful cook,

00:03:41.598 --> 00:03:44.102 position:7% line:89% align:start
and our family was really rich,

00:03:44.135 --> 00:03:47.171 position:27% line:83% align:start
my life would be
completely different.

00:03:50.508 --> 00:03:55.713 position:13% line:83% align:start
- [sighs] I got a raw deal.
- That's enough out of you.

00:03:55.747 --> 00:03:57.916 position:21% line:83% align:start
If your father and I
hadn't gotten married,

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.119 position:30% line:83% align:start
neither of you
would have been born.

00:04:00.152 --> 00:04:03.222 position:10% line:83% align:start
You wouldn't even be here had
it not been for the two of us.

00:04:03.255 --> 00:04:06.859 position:33% line:83% align:start
Yeah, right.
What do you know?

00:04:06.892 --> 00:04:10.029 position:16% line:83% align:start
If I had cooler parents,
I wouldn't be so lame.

00:04:10.062 --> 00:04:13.599 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's stupid. What do they
teach you in that school?

00:04:13.632 --> 00:04:16.635 position:5% line:83% align:start
- Haven't you heard of genetics?
- He's right.

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.737 position:7% line:89% align:start
You cannot choose your parents.

00:04:18.771 --> 00:04:21.073 position:33% line:83% align:start
And I'm just
supposed to accept that?

00:04:21.106 --> 00:04:24.143 position:24% line:83% align:start
That is so unfair.
I mean, look.

00:04:24.176 --> 00:04:27.147 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm me and Dad's Dad
and Mom's Mom, right?

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.949 position:21% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh... What? Huh?

00:04:31.617 --> 00:04:33.920 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, who are you?

00:04:34.753 --> 00:04:37.724 position:19% line:89% align:start
Where did I come from?

00:04:37.757 --> 00:04:41.828 position:21% line:89% align:start
Where am I? Who am I?

00:04:43.663 --> 00:04:45.832 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:04:45.865 --> 00:04:49.970 position:13% line:83% align:start
Once upon a time, Mommy and
Daddy weren't married at all.

00:07:54.728 --> 00:08:00.233 position:19% line:83% align:start
But we've been doing it
 <i>since the dawn of time.</i>

00:08:00.267 --> 00:08:04.472 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>Children grow up,</i>
 <i>even without their parents.</i>

00:08:04.505 --> 00:08:06.940 position:5% line:89% align:start
So hold them close to your heart

00:08:06.973 --> 00:08:09.277 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>and they will turn</i>
 <i>out just fine.</i>

00:08:24.926 --> 00:08:29.864 position:10% line:83% align:start
Having children will make you
 <i>appreciate your own parents.</i>

00:08:29.897 --> 00:08:31.999 position:7% line:89% align:start
 <i>Sure, maybe you always thought</i>

 <i>your parents were</i>
 <i>a pain in the butt.</i>

00:09:04.967 --> 00:09:07.470 position:10% line:83% align:start

Of course it does.

With all due respect,
