00:01:09.737 --> 00:01:10.604 position:27% line:89% align:start
He's over here!

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.920 position:38% line:89% align:start
Bestado!

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:42.123 position:33% line:89% align:start
This is it?

00:01:42.123 --> 00:01:43.491 position:21% line:83% align:start
- What'd you expect?
- I guess.

00:01:43.491 --> 00:01:45.225 position:33% line:83% align:start
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

00:02:13.443 --> 00:02:14.709 position:21% line:89% align:start
"I want to be free."

00:02:20.814 --> 00:02:23.182 position:24% line:83% align:start
"I want to live in
the free skies."

00:02:25.383 --> 00:02:26.184 position:24% line:89% align:start
That was my wish.

00:03:12.512 --> 00:03:14.313 position:7% line:89% align:start
You look so beautiful, milady.

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:16.247 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yes! Simply radiant!

00:03:21.283 --> 00:03:22.951 position:16% line:83% align:start
Make haste. You mustn't
keep the prince waiting.

00:03:24.651 --> 00:03:28.254 position:10% line:83% align:start
Juana, this should be common
sense, but do not behave curtly.

00:03:28.254 --> 00:03:30.622 position:13% line:83% align:start
Do as you were taught and
you ought to be fine.

00:03:30.622 --> 00:03:31.922 position:16% line:89% align:start
Just as you were taught.

00:03:37.327 --> 00:03:42.196 position:7% line:83% align:start
Do you think His Highness will
propose to Lady Juana this eve?

00:03:42.196 --> 00:03:48.066 position:7% line:77% align:start
Indeed. With the Levamme royal
family's backing, the del
Moral's prosperity is assured!

00:03:48.066 --> 00:03:50.167 position:30% line:83% align:start
Truly an event
worth celebrating.

00:03:50.167 --> 00:03:54.970 position:16% line:83% align:start
Welcome to San Maltilia,
Your Highness.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.304 position:16% line:83% align:start
You must be tired after
such a long journey.

00:03:58.005 --> 00:04:01.640 position:13% line:83% align:start
These days, traveling is a
far from comfortable affair.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.109 position:10% line:77% align:start
Are the Amatsukami army not
causing trouble on the mainland,
as well?

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.378 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes. A persistent lot, they are.

00:04:08.845 --> 00:04:11.180 position:24% line:83% align:start
They are a vulgar
bunch, to be sure.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.115 position:10% line:83% align:start
- They refuse to stay down.
- Pardon me!

00:04:14.115 --> 00:04:16.183 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Coming through.
- Please, excuse me.

00:04:16.183 --> 00:04:17.917 position:35% line:83% align:start
- Pardon.
- Excuse me.

00:04:17.917 --> 00:04:22.220 position:16% line:83% align:start
Welcome to San Maltilia,
Prince Carlo.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.822 position:13% line:71% align:start
Battalion Commander of the
Levamme Air Force, Eastern
Expeditionary Deployment,
Domingo Garcia.

00:04:25.822 --> 00:04:27.756 position:21% line:83% align:start
Word of your efforts
has reached me.

00:04:27.756 --> 00:04:28.757 position:19% line:89% align:start
That is such an honor!

00:04:30.392 --> 00:04:34.027 position:10% line:83% align:start
To think Your Highness would
come to such a distant pla oh!

00:04:39.264 --> 00:04:40.998 position:30% line:83% align:start
- She's here!
- The princess!

00:04:42.299 --> 00:04:43.065 position:33% line:89% align:start
Lady Juana!

00:04:58.241 --> 00:05:01.177 position:10% line:83% align:start
Juana, let us go. The prince
has waited long enough.

00:05:35.097 --> 00:05:37.232 position:10% line:83% align:start
Juana, offer your greetings
to Prince Carlo.

00:05:40.034 --> 00:05:41.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
It is a pleasure to
meet you, Prince Carlo.

00:05:48.038 --> 00:05:49.839 position:19% line:83% align:start
How I have longed for
this day's arrival...

00:05:50.973 --> 00:05:53.475 position:27% line:83% align:start
I thank God for
this fated meeting.

00:05:54.442 --> 00:05:56.644 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ahh, Juana...

00:05:56.644 --> 00:05:59.478 position:16% line:83% align:start
I had prepared countless
phrases to express my love,

00:05:59.478 --> 00:06:01.947 position:10% line:83% align:start
but they pale in comparison
to your absolute splendor.

00:06:06.983 --> 00:06:10.485 position:10% line:77% align:start
Juana, I would ask that you
pledge to live the rest of your
life together with me.

00:06:20.692 --> 00:06:24.026 position:27% line:83% align:start
I humbly accept
your kind proposal.

00:06:27.761 --> 00:06:31.898 position:5% line:83% align:start
I hereby promise to make you the
happiest woman in all the world!

00:06:35.967 --> 00:06:38.902 position:10% line:77% align:start
However, our homeland is in
turmoil due to the ongoing war
with the Amatsukami people...

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.803 position:35% line:89% align:start
One year.

00:06:42.737 --> 00:06:45.707 position:7% line:77% align:start
I vow to defeat the Amatsukami
army within one year and end
this struggle.

00:06:45.707 --> 00:06:47.507 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please, wait for me until then.

00:07:03.883 --> 00:07:08.087 position:5% line:77% align:start
In one year's time, you will be
Princess of Levamme, and the del
Moral family will be secure.

00:07:25.464 --> 00:07:28.699 position:13% line:83% align:start
It has already been over a
year since the betrothal,

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:31.568 position:5% line:89% align:start
and yet the war only escalates.

00:07:31.568 --> 00:07:34.336 position:7% line:83% align:start
I wonder, what will become of
your marriage to Prince Carlo?

00:07:36.671 --> 00:07:38.205 position:13% line:89% align:start
There is no need to worry.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.974 position:13% line:83% align:start
I am certain Prince Carlo
has not lapsed on his vow.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.944 position:5% line:77% align:start
Sending you letters nearly every
day... Truly, he is a kind and
sincere man.

00:07:49.845 --> 00:07:52.681 position:10% line:89% align:start
The prince is a special one.

00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:54.515 position:10% line:77% align:start
You will never find a man so
honest and awe-inspiring
anywhere else.

00:08:00.184 --> 00:08:04.254 position:7% line:83% align:start
Come, you two. It is time for
Her Highness to get some rest.

00:08:04.254 --> 00:08:04.854 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yes'm.

00:08:10.324 --> 00:08:12.258 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well then, goodnight, milady.

00:09:29.838 --> 00:09:30.606 position:38% line:89% align:start
Father?

00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:37.577 position:38% line:89% align:start
Father!

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:40.078 position:16% line:83% align:start
- Milady, please escape!
- The Amatsukami planes are !

00:09:40.078 --> 00:09:41.878 position:13% line:89% align:start
My father! My father is...

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.482 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Please hurry!
- Come quickly!

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.224 position:19% line:89% align:start
Milady, are you safe?

00:10:02.425 --> 00:10:04.992 position:33% line:89% align:start
Lady Juana!

00:10:04.992 --> 00:10:08.061 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Milady, milady!
- Milady! Lady Juana!

00:10:22.237 --> 00:10:24.071 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hurry! Everyone out!

00:10:46.618 --> 00:10:48.953 position:21% line:89% align:start
Wh-What did you say?

00:10:48.953 --> 00:10:51.454 position:16% line:83% align:start
What do you mean, "They
were after Lady Juana"?

00:10:53.122 --> 00:10:56.591 position:19% line:83% align:start
Taking the life of the
princess-to-be...

00:10:56.591 --> 00:10:59.992 position:10% line:77% align:start
is clearly their attempt to
strike a blow to all our troops'
morale!

00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:03.027 position:27% line:83% align:start
Then her life is
still in danger...

00:11:03.027 --> 00:11:06.130 position:13% line:89% align:start
There is no need to worry.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:09.832 position:10% line:77% align:start
I had received a communique
earlier that claimed, by Prince
Carlo's orders,

00:11:09.832 --> 00:11:14.235 position:5% line:83% align:start
that the 8th Special Naval Fleet
has set forth from our homeland.

00:11:14.235 --> 00:11:18.070 position:7% line:83% align:start
Then, Lady Juana will finally
be at Prince Carlo's side.

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:20.606 position:13% line:89% align:start
The day has come at last.

00:11:40.317 --> 00:11:41.084 position:38% line:89% align:start
Dammit!

00:11:54.225 --> 00:11:55.360 position:21% line:89% align:start
Did that shake him!?

00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:02.963 position:41% line:89% align:start
What!?

00:12:18.674 --> 00:12:21.008 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey Charles, how long
are you gonna sleep?

00:12:21.008 --> 00:12:23.844 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh. Mornin', Joaquin.

00:12:23.844 --> 00:12:26.679 position:19% line:83% align:start
Good morning, my foot!
It's already way past roll call.

00:12:28.979 --> 00:12:31.482 position:10% line:77% align:start
You were having a nightmare.
Still dreaming of that time you
got shot down?

00:12:31.482 --> 00:12:32.115 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:12:39.119 --> 00:12:42.421 position:7% line:83% align:start
They told you not to seriously
engage a Shinden, didn't they?

00:12:42.421 --> 00:12:44.088 position:7% line:83% align:start
No matter your skills, there's
no way you could've won.

00:12:45.723 --> 00:12:48.292 position:13% line:83% align:start
Just the fact that you're
alive is a miracle.

00:12:48.292 --> 00:12:49.726 position:16% line:83% align:start
Regardless, those things
are like monsters.

00:12:51.494 --> 00:12:55.696 position:16% line:83% align:start
Man, if only Levamme had
planes like those...

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:58.331 position:35% line:89% align:start
Charles!?

00:12:59.131 --> 00:13:00.833 position:35% line:89% align:start
Eat later.

00:13:00.833 --> 00:13:02.800 position:24% line:89% align:start
Go and wash these.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.201 position:16% line:89% align:start
And be careful with 'em!

00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:09.070 position:19% line:83% align:start
Us mercenaries aren't
here to be your moms...

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.405 position:27% line:83% align:start
What'd you say!?
Did some merc ju

00:13:12.506 --> 00:13:14.575 position:7% line:83% align:start
Wh-Why would you even protect
a good-for-nothin' bestado?

00:13:16.074 --> 00:13:17.008 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's fine, Joaquin.

00:13:17.877 --> 00:13:19.578 position:41% line:89% align:start
But !

00:13:19.578 --> 00:13:22.445 position:24% line:83% align:start
I said it's fine.
I'm used to it.

00:13:22.445 --> 00:13:25.581 position:16% line:83% align:start
At least he understands
his place.

00:13:25.581 --> 00:13:27.548 position:27% line:89% align:start
Filthy bestado.

00:13:27.548 --> 00:13:29.082 position:24% line:89% align:start
Say it again, you

00:13:29.082 --> 00:13:30.717 position:24% line:89% align:start
Drop it, Joaquin.

00:13:30.717 --> 00:13:31.318 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah! Get 'em, Joaquin!

00:13:32.751 --> 00:13:33.552 position:13% line:89% align:start
Karino, Airman 1st Class!

00:13:36.654 --> 00:13:38.589 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is Charles Karino,
Airman 1st Class, here?

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:43.358 position:30% line:89% align:start
Present, sir!

00:13:43.358 --> 00:13:44.726 position:10% line:77% align:start
There is an urgent matter to
discuss. Come with me to the
briefing room.

00:13:45.626 --> 00:13:46.025 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sir!

00:13:49.529 --> 00:13:50.629 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why is scum like him
being called in?

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:57.299 position:27% line:83% align:start
Charles Karino,
Airman 1st Class...

00:13:57.299 --> 00:14:00.535 position:10% line:83% align:start
Your father is from Levamme.
Your mother, Amatsukami.

00:14:01.803 --> 00:14:03.103 position:27% line:89% align:start
A bestado, then?

00:14:03.103 --> 00:14:03.504 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sir!

00:14:05.638 --> 00:14:09.608 position:7% line:83% align:start
The lowest class by birth... A
sewer rat raised in the slums...

00:14:11.775 --> 00:14:15.277 position:7% line:83% align:start
How did you manage to survive?
Thievery? Begging?

00:14:15.277 --> 00:14:17.713 position:10% line:89% align:start
When I was seven years old,

00:14:17.713 --> 00:14:19.247 position:10% line:77% align:start
I was granted a job here at
Almeria Airfield as a general
custodian.

00:14:20.547 --> 00:14:21.748 position:19% line:83% align:start
And how did you learn
to fly an aircraft?

00:14:23.349 --> 00:14:24.383 position:19% line:83% align:start
I learned naturally by
observing others, sir.

00:14:26.417 --> 00:14:27.552 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hmph. Stole others' abilities
with your eyes, then.

00:14:28.252 --> 00:14:29.653 position:27% line:89% align:start
As a rat would.

00:14:32.053 --> 00:14:37.223 position:16% line:77% align:start
But in mock battles, he
regularly shoots down our own
aces with ease.

00:14:37.223 --> 00:14:39.659 position:7% line:77% align:start
One cannot deny that he is the
best pilot in all of San
Maltilia.

00:14:40.559 --> 00:14:41.693 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:14:44.729 --> 00:14:46.563 position:13% line:83% align:start
I am to give you a mission
of vital importance.

00:14:47.062 --> 00:14:47.464 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sir!

00:14:49.899 --> 00:14:53.433 position:7% line:77% align:start
You are to transport a certain
individual in a reconnaissance
seaplane,

00:14:53.433 --> 00:14:56.369 position:24% line:83% align:start
and safely deliver
them to the mainland.

00:14:56.369 --> 00:14:59.804 position:16% line:83% align:start
There will be no escort.
Can you do this?

00:14:59.804 --> 00:15:02.006 position:16% line:83% align:start
It will be difficult to
break through enemy lines.

00:15:02.006 --> 00:15:02.640 position:21% line:89% align:start
But it can be done.

00:15:04.474 --> 00:15:06.742 position:7% line:83% align:start
- Have you flown solo over the
Central Sea? - I have not.

00:15:08.042 --> 00:15:09.043 position:30% line:89% align:start
Of course not.

00:15:10.778 --> 00:15:11.611 position:19% line:89% align:start
Lieutenant Colonel...

00:15:11.611 --> 00:15:12.077 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sir?

00:15:24.753 --> 00:15:25.553 position:19% line:89% align:start
How would you proceed?

00:15:32.324 --> 00:15:35.927 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's about 12,000
kilometers to the mainland.

00:15:35.927 --> 00:15:39.495 position:13% line:83% align:start
To fly that distance in a
reconnaissance seaplane,

00:15:39.495 --> 00:15:43.230 position:5% line:77% align:start
it will require three overnight
stops on the water to recharge
the hydrogen fuel cells.

00:15:44.798 --> 00:15:45.699 position:13% line:89% align:start
And the troublesome spots?

00:15:47.165 --> 00:15:48.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
The most dangerous zone
is definitely here

00:15:48.834 --> 00:15:49.768 position:21% line:89% align:start
The Great Waterfall.

00:15:51.535 --> 00:15:54.804 position:10% line:83% align:start
If we can break through the
enemy's tight patrol net here,

00:15:54.804 --> 00:15:56.638 position:13% line:83% align:start
we should be able to reach
the mainland without incident.

00:15:58.673 --> 00:16:00.407 position:10% line:83% align:start
However, the Shindens are a
real and present threat here.

00:16:03.009 --> 00:16:06.244 position:7% line:71% align:start
If I'm discovered by a Shinden
and they give pursuit, it will
be difficult for an average
plane to escape.

00:16:07.845 --> 00:16:10.212 position:16% line:77% align:start
You will use the latest
reconnaissance seaplane for this
mission

00:16:10.212 --> 00:16:11.180 position:27% line:89% align:start
The Santa Cruz.

00:16:12.048 --> 00:16:13.548 position:24% line:89% align:start
The Santa...Cruz?

00:16:15.951 --> 00:16:19.419 position:7% line:83% align:start
Its mobility far surpasses all
preceding reconnaissance crafts.

00:16:20.319 --> 00:16:23.989 position:13% line:89% align:start
Its top speed is 620 km/h.

00:16:23.989 --> 00:16:28.390 position:13% line:77% align:start
While still no match for a
Shinden, it is among the fastest
planes in existence.

00:16:30.258 --> 00:16:31.659 position:30% line:89% align:start
Anything else?

00:16:31.659 --> 00:16:33.928 position:27% line:89% align:start
One more thing.

00:16:33.928 --> 00:16:37.363 position:5% line:77% align:start
Slipping undetected through the
enemy's patrols around San
Maltilia

00:16:37.363 --> 00:16:40.365 position:24% line:83% align:start
immediately after
takeoff will be tough.

00:16:40.365 --> 00:16:42.499 position:13% line:89% align:start
That will not be an issue.

00:16:42.499 --> 00:16:45.635 position:19% line:83% align:start
All of San Maltilia's
forces will act as a decoy.

00:16:45.635 --> 00:16:47.569 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Huh? The entire ?
- Anything else?

00:16:47.569 --> 00:16:48.369 position:35% line:89% align:start
N-No, sir.

00:16:51.638 --> 00:16:52.372 position:41% line:89% align:start
Fine.

00:16:55.106 --> 00:16:59.409 position:7% line:77% align:start
Then I entrust the top secret
mission of escorting our next
princess, Juana del Moral...

00:16:59.409 --> 00:17:00.377 position:30% line:89% align:start
solely to you.

00:17:03.613 --> 00:17:07.514 position:16% line:83% align:start
You will deliver Prince
Carlo's bride to him.

00:17:09.315 --> 00:17:12.484 position:30% line:89% align:start
I-If I may...

00:17:12.484 --> 00:17:14.852 position:7% line:77% align:start
I'd heard that the 8th Special
Naval Fleet had been dispatched
for such a mission.

00:17:18.054 --> 00:17:20.789 position:10% line:77% align:start
The Special Naval Fleet came
under a full-scale attack near
the Great Waterfall...

00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:21.389 position:21% line:89% align:start
and was annihilated.

00:17:25.058 --> 00:17:29.095 position:16% line:83% align:start
If we were to be utterly
defeated by the likes of them,

00:17:29.095 --> 00:17:32.496 position:7% line:83% align:start
the reputation of the Levamme
Royal House would be questioned.

00:17:32.496 --> 00:17:35.498 position:13% line:71% align:start
And depending on the peace
faction's response, continuing
this war may become
impossible...

00:17:37.366 --> 00:17:39.634 position:27% line:83% align:start
We cannot accept
a ceasefire now!

00:17:39.634 --> 00:17:42.003 position:7% line:89% align:start
And that's where you come in!

00:17:42.003 --> 00:17:44.737 position:5% line:83% align:start
You will protect our princess as
you fly her through enemy lines!

00:17:44.737 --> 00:17:47.072 position:10% line:83% align:start
You will put her on the ship
that comes to meet you.

00:17:47.072 --> 00:17:48.806 position:13% line:83% align:start
And as the sole survivors
of the Special Navy Fleet,

00:17:48.806 --> 00:17:50.140 position:21% line:83% align:start
they will return her
to the mainland!

00:17:52.742 --> 00:17:53.376 position:30% line:89% align:start
Are we clear!?

00:18:07.084 --> 00:18:08.685 position:10% line:77% align:start
I shall do everything in my
power to accomplish this
mission!

00:18:10.219 --> 00:18:11.687 position:19% line:83% align:start
So it shall be. Await
further orders.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:12.553 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sir!

00:18:23.927 --> 00:18:26.663 position:7% line:83% align:start
Our future princess's life is
under the aegis of a bestado...

00:18:27.996 --> 00:18:28.497 position:10% line:89% align:start
What is our world coming to?

00:18:35.868 --> 00:18:39.603 position:7% line:83% align:start
- Nice one, Charles! - You're
hardcore, you know that!?

00:18:39.603 --> 00:18:41.438 position:10% line:83% align:start
I bet them enlisted bastards
are feelin' it now!

00:18:41.438 --> 00:18:42.405 position:30% line:89% align:start
Suck on that!

00:18:44.572 --> 00:18:47.142 position:27% line:83% align:start
What's with the
glum face, Charles?

00:18:47.142 --> 00:18:48.242 position:33% line:89% align:start
You nervous?

00:18:48.242 --> 00:18:50.010 position:38% line:89% align:start
N-No...

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:52.344 position:10% line:89% align:start
Don't worry! You can do it!

00:18:52.344 --> 00:18:54.578 position:10% line:89% align:start
Not like you'll be fighting.

00:18:54.578 --> 00:18:55.446 position:16% line:83% align:start
You just gotta make sure
you don't get caught!

00:18:57.114 --> 00:19:00.282 position:24% line:83% align:start
Plus, we're gonna
be your decoys!

00:19:00.282 --> 00:19:03.152 position:21% line:83% align:start
Decoys... I'm sorry
about this...

00:19:03.152 --> 00:19:05.552 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't worry about it. Acting
as decoys is a fine duty!

00:19:05.552 --> 00:19:07.787 position:5% line:89% align:start
We're not gonna die or anything!

00:19:07.787 --> 00:19:11.489 position:21% line:83% align:start
Us mercs are tougher
than cockroaches!

00:19:11.489 --> 00:19:13.490 position:19% line:83% align:start
You just deliver that
princess and get back here.

00:19:15.092 --> 00:19:17.259 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah. It's a promise.

00:19:17.259 --> 00:19:18.593 position:27% line:89% align:start
All right, boys!

00:19:20.327 --> 00:19:22.862 position:21% line:89% align:start
No one's gonna die!

00:19:22.862 --> 00:19:24.631 position:24% line:83% align:start
We'll get through
this safe and sound,

00:19:24.631 --> 00:19:26.732 position:16% line:83% align:start
and return to toast our
successful mission!

00:19:26.732 --> 00:19:28.232 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:19:51.613 --> 00:19:52.680 position:7% line:89% align:start
We will now begin the mission!

00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:57.017 position:19% line:83% align:start
The Fighter Wing will
launch immediately.

00:19:57.017 --> 00:20:01.619 position:5% line:77% align:start
The Support Wing and Bomber Wing
will both depart 15 minutes
after!

00:20:01.619 --> 00:20:06.322 position:13% line:77% align:start
You will act as decoys for
Levamme's next princess, Juana
del Moral!

00:20:06.322 --> 00:20:09.424 position:16% line:83% align:start
Draw all enemy fighters
away from San Maltilia!

00:20:09.424 --> 00:20:12.693 position:21% line:83% align:start
Engage them as long
as humanly possible,

00:20:12.693 --> 00:20:15.161 position:16% line:83% align:start
and show them the glory
of the Levamme Air Force!

00:20:15.161 --> 00:20:17.595 position:5% line:89% align:start
All hands, prepare for takeoff!

00:20:17.595 --> 00:20:17.930 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sir!

00:20:20.064 --> 00:20:21.264 position:27% line:89% align:start
Karino. With me.

00:20:21.264 --> 00:20:21.631 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sir!

00:20:23.033 --> 00:20:24.200 position:35% line:89% align:start
Good luck!

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:24.734 position:13% line:89% align:start
Leave the diversion to us!

00:20:31.838 --> 00:20:35.506 position:5% line:77% align:start
Under normal circumstances, one
such as you would never be
allowed to lay eyes on her.

00:20:35.506 --> 00:20:37.540 position:7% line:89% align:start
Speak no more than necessary.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.709 position:21% line:83% align:start
Answer all inquiries
with "yes" or "no."

00:20:39.709 --> 00:20:40.876 position:16% line:83% align:start
Do not taint Lady Juana
with your foul mouth.

00:20:42.077 --> 00:20:43.011 position:33% line:89% align:start
Understood?

00:20:43.011 --> 00:20:43.277 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sir!

00:21:03.289 --> 00:21:06.126 position:27% line:83% align:start
We apologize for
making you wait.

00:21:06.126 --> 00:21:09.560 position:5% line:77% align:start
This is Airman 1st Class Karino,
the one we have chosen for this
mission.

00:21:36.376 --> 00:21:39.445 position:21% line:89% align:start
He is quite young...

00:21:39.445 --> 00:21:41.946 position:33% line:89% align:start
Be at ease.

00:21:41.946 --> 00:21:45.414 position:16% line:83% align:start
The military vouches for
his piloting skills.

00:21:45.414 --> 00:21:48.650 position:7% line:77% align:start
He was carefully selected from
among the best pilots in the
whole Levamme Air Force.

00:21:51.186 --> 00:21:53.020 position:13% line:83% align:start
When you board the plane,
look by your feet.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:53.787 position:27% line:89% align:start
My parting gift.

00:21:56.055 --> 00:21:56.555 position:19% line:89% align:start
We're counting on you.

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:43.083 position:16% line:89% align:start
We can't load all that!

00:22:43.918 --> 00:22:44.350 position:35% line:89% align:start
Nonsense!

00:22:45.685 --> 00:22:49.121 position:19% line:83% align:start
There is no way such a
small amount won't fit!

00:22:49.121 --> 00:22:52.422 position:7% line:83% align:start
But if it's weighed down, the
plane can't go as fast...

00:22:52.422 --> 00:22:55.024 position:13% line:83% align:start
You can plainly see we've
packed only what is necessary!

00:22:55.024 --> 00:22:55.925 position:27% line:89% align:start
What? All this!?

00:22:58.492 --> 00:23:00.093 position:13% line:83% align:start
Lady Juana requires every
one of these items!

00:23:00.093 --> 00:23:01.627 position:13% line:89% align:start
We can omit nothing else!

00:23:01.627 --> 00:23:03.328 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, if you please, load it all!

00:23:03.328 --> 00:23:03.596 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh, I...

00:23:12.768 --> 00:23:15.436 position:21% line:83% align:start
Understood... We'll
load it right away.

00:23:15.436 --> 00:23:16.971 position:16% line:89% align:start
I knew it could be done.

00:23:16.971 --> 00:23:17.938 position:35% line:89% align:start
How rude.

00:23:33.914 --> 00:23:34.581 position:41% line:89% align:start
Here.

00:23:37.482 --> 00:23:37.983 position:30% line:89% align:start
Right in here.

00:23:41.484 --> 00:23:42.686 position:16% line:89% align:start
Please watch your step.

00:23:50.958 --> 00:23:52.358 position:16% line:89% align:start
Do be careful out there.

00:23:59.963 --> 00:24:01.597 position:21% line:83% align:start
Understand, Karino?
Failure is not an option.

00:24:02.898 --> 00:24:03.832 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yes, sir. I will put
my all into this.

00:24:06.566 --> 00:24:07.834 position:30% line:89% align:start
Stack, start!

00:24:07.834 --> 00:24:08.068 position:27% line:89% align:start
Clear the front!

00:24:29.547 --> 00:24:30.982 position:13% line:89% align:start
Princess, can you hear me?

00:24:33.984 --> 00:24:34.084 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:24:35.618 --> 00:24:36.151 position:19% line:89% align:start
We will now take off.

00:24:37.119 --> 00:24:37.152 position:33% line:89% align:start
Understood.

00:24:38.287 --> 00:24:40.621 position:38% line:89% align:start
Milady!

00:24:40.621 --> 00:24:43.122 position:21% line:89% align:start
Milady! Be careful!

00:24:43.122 --> 00:24:44.023 position:10% line:89% align:start
I will pray for your safety!

00:24:52.461 --> 00:24:54.029 position:35% line:83% align:start
- Milady!
- Milady!

00:25:08.905 --> 00:25:11.039 position:10% line:83% align:start
Flight tower to Santa Cruz.
You are clear for takeoff.

00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:11.439 position:30% line:89% align:start
Best of luck.

00:25:12.473 --> 00:25:12.806 position:33% line:89% align:start
Roger that.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:31.151 position:30% line:89% align:start
Here we go...

00:26:14.044 --> 00:26:14.511 position:21% line:89% align:start
All systems normal.

00:26:17.346 --> 00:26:19.147 position:10% line:83% align:start
Princess, I was informed you
completed lookout training.

00:26:21.249 --> 00:26:21.648 position:38% line:89% align:start
Correct.

00:26:23.116 --> 00:26:24.550 position:13% line:83% align:start
In that case, please watch
our rear while in flight.

00:26:25.583 --> 00:26:25.884 position:33% line:89% align:start
Understood.

00:28:40.298 --> 00:28:41.166 position:13% line:89% align:start
Let's rest here for today.

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.768 position:19% line:89% align:start
I also have a request.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.574 position:13% line:83% align:start
Please discard everything
you don't need.

00:29:09.883 --> 00:29:11.583 position:21% line:83% align:start
The Santa Cruz is a
very fast plane.

00:29:13.819 --> 00:29:17.221 position:7% line:77% align:start
However, no matter how fast it
is, if the plane is weighed
down, it'll be slow.

00:29:17.221 --> 00:29:18.755 position:21% line:83% align:start
Meaning we are more
likely to be shot down.

00:29:20.923 --> 00:29:23.058 position:10% line:89% align:start
Is that so? All right, then.

00:29:24.392 --> 00:29:26.193 position:21% line:89% align:start
Okay. If you please.

00:29:26.193 --> 00:29:26.626 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right.

00:29:50.241 --> 00:29:50.707 position:35% line:89% align:start
Princess!

00:29:51.607 --> 00:29:52.009 position:33% line:89% align:start
Right here!

00:30:20.859 --> 00:30:21.693 position:24% line:89% align:start
Are you all right?

00:30:25.262 --> 00:30:26.628 position:33% line:89% align:start
I apologize.

00:30:26.628 --> 00:30:27.796 position:24% line:89% align:start
I fell right in...

00:30:29.364 --> 00:30:30.032 position:24% line:89% align:start
Please be careful.

00:30:38.937 --> 00:30:39.870 position:21% line:83% align:start
Enemy ships! They're
heading this way!

00:30:41.839 --> 00:30:42.939 position:16% line:83% align:start
Please get in your seat.
We have to move!

00:30:47.608 --> 00:30:48.976 position:16% line:89% align:start
Forget the luggage! Now!

00:30:49.776 --> 00:30:50.010 position:30% line:89% align:start
All right...!

00:31:21.362 --> 00:31:22.696 position:16% line:89% align:start
We managed to get away.

00:31:23.264 --> 00:31:23.730 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yes...

00:31:31.369 --> 00:31:33.137 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's extracting hydrogen
gas from the seawater.

00:31:36.004 --> 00:31:39.907 position:10% line:77% align:start
It'll do so overnight, which
will restore the fuel in the
tank for tomorrow's flight.

00:31:49.746 --> 00:31:50.980 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's probably best
to change, too.

00:31:52.647 --> 00:31:53.149 position:13% line:89% align:start
I have no other outfit...

00:31:55.049 --> 00:31:56.116 position:27% line:83% align:start
My luggage fell
into the ocean...

00:32:13.994 --> 00:32:14.094 position:47% line:89% align:start
I

00:32:16.128 --> 00:32:18.397 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry for causing
you so much trouble...

00:32:19.532 --> 00:32:20.831 position:16% line:89% align:start
No, that isn't the case.

00:32:32.671 --> 00:32:33.872 position:24% line:83% align:start
Anyway, I'm going
to get some sleep.

00:32:36.208 --> 00:32:36.341 position:41% line:89% align:start
Um...

00:32:37.108 --> 00:32:37.441 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes?

00:32:39.075 --> 00:32:40.443 position:21% line:83% align:start
Where are you going
to sleep, Sir Pilot?

00:32:41.744 --> 00:32:42.244 position:33% line:89% align:start
The cockpit.

00:32:43.878 --> 00:32:44.712 position:19% line:89% align:start
In that cramped space?

00:32:46.447 --> 00:32:48.348 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm used to it. I sleep better
in there than a makeshift bed.

00:32:51.317 --> 00:32:52.584 position:19% line:83% align:start
When you go to sleep,
please put that flame out.

00:32:52.584 --> 00:32:52.951 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sure.

00:33:45.849 --> 00:33:46.383 position:33% line:89% align:start
This song...

00:34:32.777 --> 00:34:33.411 position:27% line:89% align:start
Okay, let's go.

00:34:35.079 --> 00:34:36.146 position:27% line:83% align:start
Please watch our
rear today, as well.

00:34:36.779 --> 00:34:37.146 position:38% line:89% align:start
Okay...

00:35:33.781 --> 00:35:35.416 position:5% line:83% align:start
I saw something shimmer between
the clouds to your right.

00:35:39.151 --> 00:35:39.884 position:19% line:89% align:start
I don't see anything.

00:35:41.852 --> 00:35:43.820 position:21% line:83% align:start
There, it was behind
that large cloud.

00:35:49.224 --> 00:35:51.525 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's...the enemy fleet!

00:36:03.566 --> 00:36:04.966 position:16% line:83% align:start
They aren't pursuing us.
They're moving away.

00:36:05.701 --> 00:36:06.234 position:30% line:89% align:start
Excellent eye.

00:36:07.335 --> 00:36:07.568 position:35% line:89% align:start
Well done.

00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:12.104 position:5% line:89% align:start
But why is their fleet out here?

00:36:13.071 --> 00:36:13.506 position:24% line:89% align:start
Last night, too...

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.473 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are they predicting
our flightpath?

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.275 position:13% line:89% align:start
What happens if they are?

00:36:20.777 --> 00:36:23.645 position:7% line:89% align:start
If they know of this mission,

00:36:23.645 --> 00:36:25.812 position:5% line:77% align:start
they'll probably send a wing of
their best fighters to attack
us.

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.048 position:16% line:83% align:start
If that happens, there's
zero chance of us surviving.

00:36:31.416 --> 00:36:32.883 position:13% line:83% align:start
The only weapon this plane
has is that rear-mounted gun.

00:36:34.184 --> 00:36:34.950 position:21% line:83% align:start
Did you receive any
gunnery training?

00:36:36.285 --> 00:36:36.552 position:41% line:89% align:start
No...

00:36:38.554 --> 00:36:39.354 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then we have an even
smaller chance to survive.

00:36:42.556 --> 00:36:44.490 position:10% line:89% align:start
This mission is top secret.

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:46.425 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was carefully plotted
by our top commanders.

00:36:48.627 --> 00:36:50.561 position:5% line:83% align:start
I doubt the possibility that our
mission could've been leaked.

00:37:01.735 --> 00:37:04.235 position:5% line:77% align:start
If we're able to keep this pace,
we'll reach Scion Island the day
after tomorrow.

00:37:05.903 --> 00:37:07.304 position:19% line:83% align:start
Isn't our destination
the capital?

00:37:09.205 --> 00:37:14.241 position:5% line:83% align:start
My mission is to deliver you to
a battleship near Scion Island.

00:37:16.811 --> 00:37:21.145 position:19% line:77% align:start
The plan calls for the
triumphant return of a lone
battleship

00:37:21.145 --> 00:37:22.013 position:13% line:83% align:start
the miraculous survivor of
the 8th Special Naval Fleet.

00:37:25.115 --> 00:37:27.183 position:27% line:83% align:start
But...isn't that
falsifying history?

00:37:29.351 --> 00:37:31.285 position:24% line:83% align:start
Sir Pilot, are you
okay with that?

00:37:32.885 --> 00:37:34.420 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are you okay with your
accomplishments being stolen?

00:37:36.689 --> 00:37:38.022 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll receive significant
compensation for it.

00:37:40.658 --> 00:37:44.059 position:5% line:77% align:start
A sum of money that mercenaries
like me could never hope to earn
in one lifetime.

00:37:46.194 --> 00:37:47.328 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll enjoy myself enough
for three lifetimes!

00:37:49.697 --> 00:37:50.930 position:19% line:83% align:start
After this mission is
over, I'll quit all this.

00:37:52.365 --> 00:37:53.632 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'll go and live a carefree
life on some island.

00:37:55.367 --> 00:37:56.233 position:33% line:89% align:start
Is that so?

00:38:12.777 --> 00:38:13.644 position:35% line:89% align:start
The enemy?

00:38:13.644 --> 00:38:13.877 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:38:16.078 --> 00:38:17.079 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's okay. They aren't
heading this way.

00:38:22.483 --> 00:38:23.283 position:24% line:83% align:start
They're searching
for something...

00:38:24.818 --> 00:38:25.551 position:16% line:89% align:start
This doesn't feel right.

00:38:32.355 --> 00:38:33.356 position:27% line:89% align:start
Um, Sir Pilot...

00:38:34.289 --> 00:38:34.423 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes?

00:38:36.759 --> 00:38:39.326 position:19% line:77% align:start
Is it possible for the
Amatsukami army to have
decrypted a coded transmission?

00:38:40.861 --> 00:38:42.194 position:16% line:89% align:start
The odds are pretty low.

00:38:43.863 --> 00:38:45.330 position:21% line:83% align:start
Our military leaders
aren't fools.

00:38:48.332 --> 00:38:50.099 position:7% line:89% align:start
Prince Carlo sent me a letter.

00:38:51.434 --> 00:38:51.534 position:38% line:89% align:start
Letter?

00:38:55.536 --> 00:38:57.270 position:5% line:83% align:start
"Shoved into the small rear seat
of a reconnaissance plane..."

00:38:59.071 --> 00:39:01.673 position:19% line:83% align:start
"Crossing the Central
Sea without escorts..."

00:39:03.307 --> 00:39:04.475 position:19% line:83% align:start
"I'm sorry that you're
in this situation..."

00:39:05.509 --> 00:39:06.510 position:30% line:89% align:start
So he said...

00:39:07.543 --> 00:39:08.744 position:21% line:89% align:start
Of course he would.

00:39:08.744 --> 00:39:11.112 position:21% line:89% align:start
And...that letter...

00:39:14.046 --> 00:39:16.649 position:7% line:83% align:start
was sent using our military's
wireless transmission system.

00:39:16.649 --> 00:39:17.082 position:41% line:89% align:start
What!?

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:19.016 position:10% line:89% align:start
Was that a bad thing to do?

00:39:23.753 --> 00:39:24.320 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sir Pilot?

00:39:28.189 --> 00:39:29.357 position:24% line:83% align:start
The mission's been
compromised...

00:39:30.657 --> 00:39:32.191 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yesterday, scores of
planes left as decoys...

00:39:34.326 --> 00:39:36.027 position:7% line:77% align:start
They attacked the enemy base,
knowing they were lambs to the
slaughter.

00:39:38.228 --> 00:39:39.296 position:5% line:83% align:start
- Doesn't the Prince understand
our situation? - Um...

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.468 position:19% line:83% align:start
The prince was worried
about me, and

00:39:48.468 --> 00:39:50.169 position:30% line:83% align:start
As long as his
precious bride's safe,

00:39:50.169 --> 00:39:51.570 position:19% line:83% align:start
it doesn't matter what
happens to us soldiers?

00:39:52.704 --> 00:39:53.671 position:27% line:89% align:start
Th-That's not...

00:39:54.839 --> 00:39:55.939 position:27% line:89% align:start
The prince is...

00:39:57.006 --> 00:40:00.208 position:16% line:89% align:start
He's sincere and honest!

00:40:00.208 --> 00:40:01.276 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah, so honest he doesn't
think to doubt others!

00:40:02.911 --> 00:40:05.077 position:7% line:83% align:start
He didn't even think that his
transmission could be decrypted!

00:40:34.296 --> 00:40:35.396 position:13% line:83% align:start
We don't know for certain
that our mission was leaked.

00:40:37.398 --> 00:40:38.331 position:21% line:83% align:start
The two of us have a
chance, together.

00:40:39.998 --> 00:40:42.267 position:16% line:89% align:start
You have excellent eyes.

00:40:42.267 --> 00:40:43.868 position:13% line:83% align:start
You were as good a lookout
as any airman today.

00:40:43.868 --> 00:40:44.368 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm not...

00:40:46.536 --> 00:40:49.305 position:10% line:83% align:start
We'll spot the enemy before
they spot us and run.

00:40:49.305 --> 00:40:50.438 position:13% line:83% align:start
As long as we can do that,
we'll definitely make it.

00:40:52.674 --> 00:40:53.540 position:13% line:89% align:start
Will I really be of help?

00:40:54.741 --> 00:40:55.408 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm counting on you.

00:40:56.676 --> 00:40:57.008 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay!

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:00.579 position:21% line:89% align:start
Let's get some rest.

00:41:01.445 --> 00:41:01.579 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:41:03.012 --> 00:41:05.147 position:10% line:89% align:start
Sorry about yelling before.

00:41:06.415 --> 00:41:06.482 position:38% line:89% align:start
Okay...

00:41:09.951 --> 00:41:11.251 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well, goodnight.

00:41:11.885 --> 00:41:12.452 position:35% line:89% align:start
Goodnight.

00:41:26.961 --> 00:41:27.461 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sir Pilot?

00:41:34.998 --> 00:41:35.766 position:33% line:89% align:start
P-Princess!

00:41:43.537 --> 00:41:45.439 position:21% line:83% align:start
What were you trying
to do just then?

00:41:46.439 --> 00:41:47.139 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:41:49.274 --> 00:41:50.207 position:13% line:83% align:start
I was thinking of letting
you sleep in here.

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:55.010 position:16% line:83% align:start
I wanted you...to get a
good night's rest...

00:41:57.112 --> 00:41:58.212 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm used to the cockpit. Really.

00:42:00.748 --> 00:42:03.783 position:7% line:77% align:start
Besides, I'm so worried about
your constant trips right into
the ocean, I can't sleep.

00:42:10.921 --> 00:42:13.355 position:7% line:83% align:start
The beautiful blue sea that I
saw from my chamber's window...

00:42:16.757 --> 00:42:20.092 position:13% line:83% align:start
It seemed so refreshing. I
always wanted to swim in it.

00:42:24.529 --> 00:42:26.329 position:13% line:83% align:start
But to think my wish would
come true like this is...

00:42:27.831 --> 00:42:29.565 position:10% line:83% align:start
Personally, I'd say you were
drowning, not swimming.

00:42:31.366 --> 00:42:31.599 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:42:49.977 --> 00:42:50.745 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's strange...

00:42:52.646 --> 00:42:54.680 position:10% line:83% align:start
I feel as though this isn't
our first time meeting.

00:42:56.015 --> 00:42:57.148 position:24% line:89% align:start
Why, I wonder...?

00:43:15.927 --> 00:43:19.361 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why do we have to work
with this filthy bestado?

00:43:20.963 --> 00:43:23.965 position:13% line:89% align:start
Must be the brat's mother.

00:43:23.965 --> 00:43:27.500 position:13% line:77% align:start
Don't ask me why, but the
princess is quite taken with
her.

00:43:29.067 --> 00:43:32.269 position:10% line:83% align:start
They should just kick those
dirty rats out of the mansion!

00:43:49.047 --> 00:43:49.646 position:30% line:89% align:start
What's wrong?

00:43:51.548 --> 00:43:53.115 position:13% line:89% align:start
Do you work in the garden?

00:43:55.116 --> 00:43:55.784 position:27% line:89% align:start
Are you crying?

00:43:57.251 --> 00:43:59.152 position:5% line:89% align:start
Did something bad happen to you?

00:44:00.887 --> 00:44:02.321 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's nothing. I'm not crying.

00:44:28.071 --> 00:44:30.371 position:7% line:89% align:start
Flowers bloom toward the sky.

00:44:32.372 --> 00:44:36.742 position:7% line:77% align:start
Since flowers can't leave the
ground, they long for the free,
open sky.

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:39.877 position:30% line:89% align:start
Free and open?

00:44:40.877 --> 00:44:41.878 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's what Chise said.

00:44:44.046 --> 00:44:46.615 position:10% line:83% align:start
- Lady Juana! Where are you?
- Princess, where are you?

00:44:48.083 --> 00:44:49.583 position:21% line:89% align:start
Sorry, I have to go.

00:45:11.097 --> 00:45:11.730 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sir Pilot?

00:45:37.979 --> 00:45:39.647 position:24% line:89% align:start
Siiiir Piiiilot...

00:46:04.762 --> 00:46:05.728 position:19% line:83% align:start
We'll cross the Great
Waterfall today.

00:46:07.597 --> 00:46:10.398 position:21% line:83% align:start
The enemy patrol is
the tightest here.

00:46:10.398 --> 00:46:11.465 position:21% line:83% align:start
Please be even more
vigilant than before.

00:46:12.198 --> 00:46:12.533 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:46:30.844 --> 00:46:30.911 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:46:32.779 --> 00:46:33.278 position:30% line:89% align:start
What's wrong?

00:46:34.746 --> 00:46:36.914 position:10% line:83% align:start
I could see the sky through
the clouds before...

00:46:37.782 --> 00:46:39.949 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, so...?

00:46:39.949 --> 00:46:42.316 position:10% line:83% align:start
Just now, the break between
the clouds was completely dark.

00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:05.230 position:41% line:89% align:start
Shit!

00:47:14.737 --> 00:47:17.305 position:13% line:83% align:start
Surrounded... The mission
was definitely leaked.

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:43.788 position:24% line:89% align:start
Incoming missiles!

00:47:43.788 --> 00:47:44.688 position:5% line:77% align:start
I don't need a lookout anymore!
Talk now and you'll bite your
tongue!

00:48:06.935 --> 00:48:08.302 position:16% line:83% align:start
This is gonna get rough!
Keep your head down!

00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.724 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:49:26.382 --> 00:49:26.717 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sir Pilot?

00:49:32.187 --> 00:49:32.686 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sir Pilot!

00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:33.954 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sir Pilot!

00:49:38.957 --> 00:49:39.824 position:30% line:89% align:start
Shin...dens...

00:49:47.495 --> 00:49:47.996 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sir Pilot!

00:49:55.234 --> 00:49:56.601 position:19% line:89% align:start
Sir Pilot! Sir Pilot!

00:50:00.637 --> 00:50:01.838 position:16% line:89% align:start
Stay strong, Sir Pilot!

00:50:25.552 --> 00:50:27.553 position:24% line:89% align:start
Forgive me, Lord.

00:50:30.922 --> 00:50:31.556 position:27% line:89% align:start
Why won't it...?

00:50:46.299 --> 00:50:46.865 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sir Pilot!

00:50:48.233 --> 00:50:49.532 position:27% line:89% align:start
Overboost, huh?

00:50:49.532 --> 00:50:50.034 position:27% line:89% align:start
Crafty little...

00:51:07.144 --> 00:51:08.544 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry...

00:51:08.544 --> 00:51:10.512 position:10% line:89% align:start
I...couldn't do anything...

00:51:13.647 --> 00:51:15.815 position:10% line:89% align:start
Juana... I will protect you.

00:51:20.052 --> 00:51:20.751 position:24% line:89% align:start
Just talk to me...

00:51:22.352 --> 00:51:25.088 position:27% line:83% align:start
If I don't stay
engaged, I might faint.

00:51:26.922 --> 00:51:29.424 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hang in there!

00:51:29.424 --> 00:51:31.491 position:5% line:77% align:start
Once you complete this mission,
you'll be rich and live a
carefree life, right?

00:51:34.126 --> 00:51:34.760 position:41% line:89% align:start
No...

00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:36.862 position:16% line:89% align:start
This isn't about money.

00:51:38.495 --> 00:51:39.830 position:35% line:89% align:start
Then, why?

00:51:41.564 --> 00:51:43.066 position:19% line:83% align:start
This mission calls for
me to save a life.

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:47.534 position:16% line:83% align:start
Not to take lives away,
like all my other missions.

00:51:48.568 --> 00:51:49.603 position:7% line:89% align:start
Even if it's only one time...

00:51:51.604 --> 00:51:53.038 position:10% line:83% align:start
I want to complete a mission
that I can be proud of.

00:52:03.744 --> 00:52:04.812 position:19% line:83% align:start
Surviving for so long
in a Levamme plane...

00:52:05.678 --> 00:52:06.512 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's some skill...

00:52:14.252 --> 00:52:17.319 position:10% line:89% align:start
Damn, why can't I hit him!?

00:52:17.319 --> 00:52:19.587 position:7% line:77% align:start
Shinden Flight Squad Six, you
will soon exit the flagship's
transmission range!

00:52:19.587 --> 00:52:21.488 position:27% line:89% align:start
Return at once!

00:52:21.488 --> 00:52:23.056 position:7% line:83% align:start
We've chased him all this way.
Like hell I'm turning back now.

00:52:27.826 --> 00:52:29.160 position:13% line:89% align:start
Sir Pilot, hang in there!

00:52:30.828 --> 00:52:32.028 position:35% line:89% align:start
I love it.

00:52:32.028 --> 00:52:32.161 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?

00:52:33.528 --> 00:52:35.529 position:10% line:89% align:start
I love flying in the sky...

00:52:38.199 --> 00:52:38.932 position:19% line:89% align:start
The sky is wonderful.

00:52:40.466 --> 00:52:42.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
Your social status
doesn't matter up here.

00:52:42.234 --> 00:52:42.835 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're free.

00:52:53.108 --> 00:52:54.441 position:41% line:89% align:start
Damn!

00:52:54.441 --> 00:52:56.409 position:16% line:89% align:start
Enough. Abandon pursuit.

00:52:56.409 --> 00:52:58.144 position:5% line:89% align:start
But, First Lieutenant Chijiwa !

00:52:58.144 --> 00:52:58.443 position:27% line:89% align:start
We're returning.

00:53:02.246 --> 00:53:02.813 position:41% line:89% align:start
Damn!

00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:09.084 position:33% line:89% align:start
The enemy...

00:53:14.687 --> 00:53:15.553 position:30% line:89% align:start
We've escaped!

00:53:52.476 --> 00:53:53.543 position:5% line:89% align:start
We're going to crash, Sir Pilot!

00:54:09.154 --> 00:54:09.753 position:30% line:89% align:start
You can do it!

00:54:53.213 --> 00:54:53.947 position:10% line:89% align:start
We've crossed the waterfall!

00:54:55.114 --> 00:54:55.982 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just a bit farther...

00:54:57.749 --> 00:54:58.883 position:10% line:89% align:start
You can do this, Sir Pilot!

00:54:59.683 --> 00:55:00.617 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hang in there!

00:55:35.005 --> 00:55:35.605 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sir Pilot!

00:56:50.784 --> 00:56:51.985 position:33% line:89% align:start
Sir Pilot...

00:57:36.379 --> 00:57:36.978 position:33% line:89% align:start
Sir Pilot...

00:57:47.018 --> 00:57:51.921 position:13% line:89% align:start
Until your sadness ends...

00:57:54.322 --> 00:58:03.295 position:7% line:77% align:start
Just close your eyes for now,
and let me protect you in my
breast...

00:58:07.964 --> 00:58:19.971 position:16% line:83% align:start
When you open your eyes,
is not something there?

00:58:19.971 --> 00:58:31.278 position:16% line:83% align:start
When you reach tomorrow,
something surely awaits...

00:59:13.437 --> 00:59:14.670 position:16% line:89% align:start
Good morning, Sir Pilot!

00:59:19.707 --> 00:59:20.640 position:27% line:89% align:start
How do you feel?

00:59:24.477 --> 00:59:27.044 position:19% line:89% align:start
P-Princess, your hair!

00:59:28.312 --> 00:59:30.413 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, this? It was in
my way, so I cut it.

00:59:31.814 --> 00:59:32.915 position:16% line:89% align:start
Does this look suit me?

00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:35.049 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yeah...

00:59:52.628 --> 00:59:53.161 position:27% line:89% align:start
What'll you do?

00:59:57.663 --> 00:59:58.763 position:10% line:89% align:start
I really pushed it too far.

01:00:00.865 --> 01:00:01.999 position:24% line:83% align:start
I have to move it
inland and repair it.

01:00:02.699 --> 01:00:03.666 position:33% line:89% align:start
Let me help!

01:00:05.368 --> 01:00:06.369 position:24% line:89% align:start
What do you mean?

01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:10.704 position:7% line:77% align:start
So you're saying I should just
relax as an injured person toils
away?

01:01:55.968 --> 01:01:56.802 position:30% line:89% align:start
How wonderful!

01:02:46.499 --> 01:02:47.065 position:33% line:89% align:start
That song...

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:53.802 position:5% line:83% align:start
The woman who cared for me when
I was little taught it to me.

01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:55.837 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's pretty, isn't it?

01:03:01.841 --> 01:03:04.776 position:5% line:83% align:start
When I was a kid, I would listen
to that song as I fell asleep.

01:03:06.711 --> 01:03:09.345 position:7% line:83% align:start
My mother and I worked at the
del Moral household years ago.

01:03:11.547 --> 01:03:14.515 position:10% line:83% align:start
I worked in the garden, and
my mother was a maid...

01:03:17.550 --> 01:03:19.885 position:7% line:89% align:start
You mean... You're Chise's...?

01:03:24.054 --> 01:03:26.523 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm Chise Karino's son...
Charles Karino.

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.993 position:7% line:89% align:start
You still remember my mother.

01:03:35.228 --> 01:03:36.496 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's no way I
would forget her.

01:03:41.565 --> 01:03:43.832 position:5% line:83% align:start
When I was little, I was scared
of the dark and couldn't sleep.

01:03:48.069 --> 01:03:50.836 position:7% line:77% align:start
But if I tried to sleep in my
mother's chambers, I would get
scolded.

01:03:53.272 --> 01:03:56.508 position:16% line:83% align:start
During those days, Chise
would secretly stay by my side.

01:03:58.108 --> 01:04:04.211 position:13% line:89% align:start
Here, inside my warmth...

01:04:04.211 --> 01:04:10.582 position:13% line:89% align:start
Until your sadness ends...

01:04:10.582 --> 01:04:16.886 position:7% line:89% align:start
Just for now, close your eyes,

01:04:16.886 --> 01:04:20.121 position:19% line:89% align:start
and let me protect...

01:04:24.123 --> 01:04:26.225 position:5% line:89% align:start
But then, my father found out...

01:04:27.659 --> 01:04:28.926 position:7% line:89% align:start
Get out of here this instant!

01:04:31.028 --> 01:04:32.896 position:13% line:89% align:start
Because of me... Chise...

01:04:34.464 --> 01:04:35.963 position:27% line:83% align:start
My mother never
forgot you, either.

01:04:37.131 --> 01:04:39.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
She spoke about you
so many times.

01:04:42.034 --> 01:04:43.868 position:19% line:89% align:start
Is Chise...doing well?

01:04:49.105 --> 01:04:51.374 position:21% line:83% align:start
She died soon after
we left the mansion.

01:04:57.110 --> 01:04:58.844 position:30% line:89% align:start
Your mother...

01:05:00.579 --> 01:05:02.146 position:21% line:89% align:start
taught me kindness.

01:05:03.914 --> 01:05:06.016 position:7% line:89% align:start
Chise... I want to see Chise!

01:05:11.653 --> 01:05:14.521 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm sure my mother is grateful
to hear how you feel about her.

01:05:17.790 --> 01:05:21.092 position:7% line:77% align:start
So wipe those tears away. You
can mourn for her once you're
safe in the capital.

01:05:28.262 --> 01:05:29.397 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't want to go
to the capital...

01:05:31.765 --> 01:05:35.801 position:7% line:77% align:start
I want to discard my house and
family name, and fly through the
skies forever!

01:05:35.801 --> 01:05:38.569 position:5% line:83% align:start
You said you were going to live
carefree on some island, right?

01:05:38.569 --> 01:05:40.336 position:24% line:89% align:start
Take me with you!

01:05:40.336 --> 01:05:41.104 position:41% line:83% align:start
- I !
- Princess!

01:05:46.507 --> 01:05:47.006 position:38% line:89% align:start
I can't.

01:05:48.308 --> 01:05:49.609 position:5% line:89% align:start
Everyone shares the same wish...

01:05:51.176 --> 01:05:52.378 position:7% line:89% align:start
For you to be with the prince.

01:05:53.877 --> 01:05:56.446 position:27% line:83% align:start
You... You won't
listen to my wish?

01:06:07.018 --> 01:06:07.453 position:33% line:89% align:start
You mustn't!

01:06:12.623 --> 01:06:14.324 position:13% line:89% align:start
Okay, give me the bottle.

01:06:14.324 --> 01:06:14.557 position:44% line:89% align:start
No!

01:06:16.958 --> 01:06:17.493 position:33% line:89% align:start
Please stop!

01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:20.427 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you drink more, it'll
hinder tomorrow's flight!

01:06:23.062 --> 01:06:24.096 position:33% line:89% align:start
Like I care!

01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:26.997 position:10% line:89% align:start
If you want it, come get it.

01:06:26.997 --> 01:06:27.465 position:33% line:89% align:start
You coward!

01:06:29.233 --> 01:06:31.200 position:21% line:89% align:start
H-How am I a coward?

01:06:31.768 --> 01:06:32.402 position:38% line:89% align:start
Because!

01:06:33.836 --> 01:06:35.035 position:10% line:83% align:start
Last night, you said social
status doesn't matter!

01:06:36.303 --> 01:06:37.904 position:24% line:83% align:start
And just one night
later, you deny it!

01:06:37.904 --> 01:06:39.305 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well, that's...

01:06:40.372 --> 01:06:41.640 position:5% line:89% align:start
Forget it. I feel like an idiot.

01:06:43.107 --> 01:06:47.110 position:16% line:83% align:start
Compared to you, Prince
Carlo is so much better!

01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:51.312 position:7% line:83% align:start
He's handsome, and sincere...
And handsome!

01:06:51.312 --> 01:06:53.113 position:7% line:89% align:start
Princess, don't mess around...

01:06:53.113 --> 01:06:54.681 position:21% line:89% align:start
I never mess around!

01:06:54.681 --> 01:06:55.482 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm always serious!

01:07:01.585 --> 01:07:02.620 position:21% line:89% align:start
So...dance with me!

01:07:05.422 --> 01:07:06.155 position:30% line:89% align:start
Right now...?

01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:10.257 position:30% line:89% align:start
I...I cannot.

01:07:10.257 --> 01:07:11.658 position:38% line:89% align:start
Why not?

01:07:11.658 --> 01:07:13.727 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm not a noble.

01:07:13.727 --> 01:07:15.026 position:13% line:89% align:start
I don't know how to dance.

01:07:20.798 --> 01:07:22.231 position:7% line:89% align:start
In that case, I'll teach you!

01:07:26.734 --> 01:07:27.435 position:33% line:89% align:start
P-Princess!

01:07:28.736 --> 01:07:29.536 position:33% line:89% align:start
Please stop!

01:07:33.806 --> 01:07:34.605 position:19% line:89% align:start
Princess, I can't...!

01:08:05.057 --> 01:08:06.458 position:30% line:83% align:start
All right. Why
don't we rest now?

01:08:14.696 --> 01:08:15.163 position:35% line:89% align:start
Princess?

01:08:16.832 --> 01:08:17.364 position:30% line:89% align:start
Are you okay?

01:09:37.112 --> 01:09:38.380 position:38% line:89% align:start
U-Um...

01:09:39.113 --> 01:09:39.447 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes?

01:09:40.982 --> 01:09:42.549 position:19% line:89% align:start
Last night... Well...

01:09:51.455 --> 01:09:52.655 position:5% line:89% align:start
There's good cloud cover today.

01:09:55.757 --> 01:09:57.525 position:13% line:83% align:start
Let's get moving. This'll
be the final flight.

01:10:01.628 --> 01:10:01.794 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

01:10:26.543 --> 01:10:27.777 position:24% line:83% align:start
We'll reach Scion
Island this afternoon.

01:10:29.410 --> 01:10:30.645 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's where we'll part.

01:10:32.914 --> 01:10:33.547 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're okay with that?

01:10:37.582 --> 01:10:39.283 position:10% line:83% align:start
Let's focus on reaching our
destination safely for now.

01:10:41.385 --> 01:10:43.185 position:16% line:83% align:start
I expect the enemy fleet
to still be in the area.

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.421 position:10% line:89% align:start
We saw those patrol planes.

01:10:48.455 --> 01:10:51.257 position:13% line:77% align:start
They probably know we were
hiding on one of the islands
around there.

01:10:57.561 --> 01:10:57.828 position:41% line:89% align:start
So...

01:10:58.728 --> 01:10:59.061 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes?

01:11:00.462 --> 01:11:01.297 position:7% line:89% align:start
Teach me how to fire this gun.

01:11:03.498 --> 01:11:05.165 position:5% line:77% align:start
The day before last, even though
I pulled the trigger, nothing
happened.

01:11:06.099 --> 01:11:07.300 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's because the safety's on.

01:11:08.834 --> 01:11:09.134 position:30% line:89% align:start
Where's that?

01:11:10.435 --> 01:11:11.369 position:16% line:89% align:start
On the gun's left side.

01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:16.773 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, this?

01:11:18.974 --> 01:11:19.608 position:27% line:89% align:start
I can shoot now?

01:11:22.142 --> 01:11:24.544 position:7% line:77% align:start
- You could, but... - You said
the two of us have a chance,
right?

01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:29.112 position:33% line:89% align:start
Understood.

01:11:30.647 --> 01:11:32.181 position:24% line:83% align:start
Okay, I'll let you
know when to shoot.

01:11:33.849 --> 01:11:36.084 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's hard to land a hit, so
please just keep firing.

01:11:36.851 --> 01:11:37.284 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sure!

01:11:41.254 --> 01:11:44.256 position:10% line:77% align:start
But with today's great cloud
coverage, they won't find us
easi

01:11:48.925 --> 01:11:49.693 position:21% line:89% align:start
They're so close...

01:11:51.126 --> 01:11:52.126 position:10% line:89% align:start
Were we discovered already?

01:11:53.194 --> 01:11:54.128 position:19% line:89% align:start
Behind, to your left!

01:12:06.036 --> 01:12:09.237 position:27% line:83% align:start
Seven ships are
coming from below!

01:12:09.237 --> 01:12:10.338 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'll lose them!

01:12:20.712 --> 01:12:21.445 position:27% line:89% align:start
Heavy cruisers?

01:12:37.254 --> 01:12:38.355 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll plow through
with overboost!

01:13:22.682 --> 01:13:23.348 position:35% line:89% align:start
It worked!

01:13:24.549 --> 01:13:25.584 position:27% line:83% align:start
Let's escape by
hiding in the clouds.

01:13:28.385 --> 01:13:30.487 position:13% line:89% align:start
Perhaps I spoke too soon.

01:13:38.058 --> 01:13:38.825 position:27% line:89% align:start
Just one plane?

01:13:47.697 --> 01:13:48.397 position:35% line:89% align:start
That's...

01:13:55.702 --> 01:13:56.168 position:30% line:89% align:start
What's he...?

01:13:57.436 --> 01:13:58.504 position:24% line:83% align:start
He's requesting a
one-on-one fight.

01:13:59.804 --> 01:14:01.805 position:21% line:83% align:start
The tradition of the
Amatsukami duel.

01:14:03.073 --> 01:14:04.640 position:16% line:89% align:start
Like the samurai, right?

01:14:06.307 --> 01:14:07.942 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's the surest method
to take us down.

01:14:10.944 --> 01:14:13.546 position:5% line:71% align:start
More so than a group of amateurs
pursuing us, a single highly
skilled pilot is a frightening
thing.

01:14:15.047 --> 01:14:16.714 position:13% line:89% align:start
So...how will you respond?

01:14:19.116 --> 01:14:20.316 position:24% line:83% align:start
If we can escape,
we'll have won.

01:14:27.088 --> 01:14:28.488 position:21% line:89% align:start
Show me your skills.

01:14:33.425 --> 01:14:34.525 position:19% line:89% align:start
This is it, Princess.

01:14:35.893 --> 01:14:37.460 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's dangerous, but
together, we will succeed!

01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:39.494 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yes! Together!

01:15:12.115 --> 01:15:13.215 position:7% line:89% align:start
Your upper left! He's coming!

01:15:19.186 --> 01:15:21.787 position:21% line:89% align:start
Why isn't he firing?

01:15:21.787 --> 01:15:23.855 position:7% line:83% align:start
He won't waste any ammo until
he has a perfectly clear shot.

01:15:33.894 --> 01:15:34.427 position:21% line:89% align:start
I won't lose to you.

01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:54.306 position:27% line:89% align:start
I won't lose...

01:15:55.674 --> 01:15:56.975 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can't lose after
making it all this way.

01:15:58.076 --> 01:15:58.576 position:33% line:89% align:start
I believe...

01:16:00.910 --> 01:16:01.811 position:24% line:89% align:start
I believe in you!

01:16:13.785 --> 01:16:14.619 position:27% line:89% align:start
How about this?

01:16:51.142 --> 01:16:51.708 position:41% line:89% align:start
Damn!

01:17:03.348 --> 01:17:04.916 position:21% line:83% align:start
Follow me. I've been
saving this one...

01:17:17.891 --> 01:17:18.557 position:44% line:89% align:start
Now!

01:17:29.531 --> 01:17:30.564 position:27% line:89% align:start
Victory is mine!

01:18:02.984 --> 01:18:05.451 position:41% line:89% align:start
Juana!

01:18:43.641 --> 01:18:45.710 position:13% line:89% align:start
Still airborne after that?

01:18:45.710 --> 01:18:46.410 position:24% line:83% align:start
He's our foe, but
he's very skilled.

01:18:51.247 --> 01:18:52.714 position:24% line:89% align:start
I was careless...

01:18:52.714 --> 01:18:54.748 position:13% line:89% align:start
I wasn't expecting that...

01:19:07.257 --> 01:19:07.723 position:35% line:89% align:start
Let's go!

01:19:53.651 --> 01:19:54.751 position:16% line:89% align:start
Our flight is at an end.

01:19:56.619 --> 01:19:58.020 position:19% line:83% align:start
All that's left is to
wait for the envoy.

01:20:08.492 --> 01:20:10.394 position:21% line:83% align:start
I want to take this
with me to the capital.

01:20:11.896 --> 01:20:14.097 position:19% line:83% align:start
When I look at it now,
I see it as a friend.

01:20:15.564 --> 01:20:17.999 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then that makes you
a pilot as well.

01:20:21.167 --> 01:20:23.802 position:10% line:77% align:start
To a pilot, his plane is his
comrade that risks its life with
him in combat.

01:20:24.669 --> 01:20:27.871 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm a...pilot?

01:20:27.871 --> 01:20:29.705 position:7% line:83% align:start
You shot down an enemy plane,
so you've earned the title.

01:20:31.706 --> 01:20:32.841 position:27% line:83% align:start
Only because you
gave me the order.

01:20:34.642 --> 01:20:36.010 position:5% line:89% align:start
You shouted my name, didn't you?

01:20:37.911 --> 01:20:39.112 position:41% line:89% align:start
Juana!

01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:43.814 position:10% line:83% align:start
I thought it was the end for
us, so impulsively, I...

01:20:48.984 --> 01:20:50.052 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, really?

01:20:50.052 --> 01:20:50.919 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

01:20:53.654 --> 01:20:55.655 position:21% line:89% align:start
I helped, didn't I?

01:21:06.728 --> 01:21:08.062 position:19% line:83% align:start
I want you to come to
the capital with me.

01:21:10.298 --> 01:21:11.598 position:21% line:89% align:start
They won't allow it.

01:21:13.766 --> 01:21:15.767 position:7% line:89% align:start
That doesn't feel right to me.

01:21:18.669 --> 01:21:22.204 position:5% line:77% align:start
The ones who rescue you must be
the special forces, not some
mercenary.

01:21:24.438 --> 01:21:27.174 position:10% line:77% align:start
Then at least board the ship
with me and participate in the
ceremony!

01:21:28.007 --> 01:21:28.441 position:41% line:89% align:start
So...

01:21:29.909 --> 01:21:31.944 position:27% line:83% align:start
If I did that, I
wouldn't get the reward.

01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:37.980 position:24% line:83% align:start
You said it wasn't
about the money!

01:21:39.949 --> 01:21:42.150 position:24% line:83% align:start
M-Mercenaries only
work for money.

01:21:43.450 --> 01:21:44.750 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's the type of man I am.

01:21:46.285 --> 01:21:47.485 position:27% line:83% align:start
- That's a lie!
- It isn't!

01:21:50.788 --> 01:21:53.523 position:10% line:83% align:start
So you're fine with us never
meeting again, Charles?

01:22:28.178 --> 01:22:29.211 position:21% line:83% align:start
They sent something
impressive for you.

01:22:38.616 --> 01:22:40.884 position:19% line:83% align:start
They'll never allow me
to set foot on that.

01:23:19.508 --> 01:23:20.508 position:13% line:89% align:start
Let me take a look at you.

01:23:25.678 --> 01:23:28.580 position:13% line:83% align:start
I pray that sadness never
again befalls you.

01:23:30.714 --> 01:23:32.548 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't have made
it here on my own.

01:23:34.650 --> 01:23:35.917 position:13% line:83% align:start
This only happened because
I had you with me.

01:23:42.188 --> 01:23:42.956 position:24% line:89% align:start
I feel the same...

01:23:44.056 --> 01:23:44.957 position:30% line:89% align:start
Without you...

01:23:51.794 --> 01:23:54.863 position:21% line:83% align:start
You are my hope. For
now, and forever.

01:24:09.305 --> 01:24:10.705 position:24% line:89% align:start
Get away from her!

01:24:31.352 --> 01:24:33.319 position:13% line:89% align:start
Know your place, you rat!

01:24:36.455 --> 01:24:38.222 position:21% line:89% align:start
What are you doing!?

01:24:38.222 --> 01:24:38.855 position:24% line:89% align:start
Please stand back.

01:24:41.258 --> 01:24:41.757 position:24% line:89% align:start
This way, milady.

01:24:43.691 --> 01:24:45.592 position:13% line:83% align:start
Wait! What are you doing?
Stop it!

01:24:46.593 --> 01:24:47.261 position:21% line:89% align:start
Bring Charles, too!

01:24:52.597 --> 01:24:53.764 position:13% line:89% align:start
Go on, check the contents.

01:24:55.399 --> 01:24:56.267 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hurry it up!

01:25:06.672 --> 01:25:07.274 position:33% line:89% align:start
Let's see...

01:25:15.745 --> 01:25:16.845 position:24% line:89% align:start
How nice for you.

01:25:18.579 --> 01:25:20.681 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll keep quiet about what
I witnessed. Be grateful.

01:25:22.715 --> 01:25:25.751 position:5% line:77% align:start
After all, were I to tell them,
they would put you in front of a
firing squad.

01:25:27.819 --> 01:25:31.288 position:13% line:89% align:start
Let me go! Bring him, too!

01:25:31.288 --> 01:25:33.823 position:13% line:83% align:start
Charles, raise your head!
Aren't you proud of yourself!?

01:25:35.190 --> 01:25:38.425 position:13% line:83% align:start
- You did something no one
else could! - Push off!

01:25:38.425 --> 01:25:39.293 position:24% line:83% align:start
You shouldn't feel
inferior to these men!

01:25:40.827 --> 01:25:41.893 position:16% line:89% align:start
Say something, Charles!

01:25:43.328 --> 01:25:45.729 position:38% line:89% align:start
Charles!

01:26:49.734 --> 01:26:50.668 position:13% line:89% align:start
This is beyond offensive!

01:26:53.103 --> 01:26:54.704 position:19% line:83% align:start
Is this how the proud
Levamme Royal Family acts!?

01:26:56.839 --> 01:26:58.073 position:19% line:83% align:start
He risked his life to
complete this mission!

01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:02.109 position:5% line:83% align:start
And you simply toss him a treat
like a dog and abandon him...

01:27:03.776 --> 01:27:04.344 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is this how humans
ought to behave!?

01:27:05.677 --> 01:27:07.146 position:5% line:89% align:start
Princess, please calm yourself.

01:27:12.516 --> 01:27:16.117 position:13% line:83% align:start
It seems Her Highness was
deceived by that pilot.

01:27:19.153 --> 01:27:22.288 position:13% line:83% align:start
Perhaps he played the role
of knight in front of you,

01:27:24.322 --> 01:27:27.224 position:5% line:77% align:start
but when he saw the gold spread
before him, his true colors
emerged.

01:27:29.159 --> 01:27:33.395 position:10% line:83% align:start
That ill-born face, drooling
at the sight of gold dust...

01:27:33.395 --> 01:27:35.096 position:21% line:83% align:start
I would have enjoyed
showing you that!

01:27:45.402 --> 01:27:46.035 position:35% line:89% align:start
That's...

01:27:55.542 --> 01:27:56.341 position:27% line:89% align:start
The Santa Cruz!

01:27:58.410 --> 01:28:00.144 position:38% line:89% align:start
Charles!

01:28:00.144 --> 01:28:01.878 position:5% line:89% align:start
What is that fool trying to do!?

01:28:06.748 --> 01:28:08.183 position:10% line:89% align:start
Please let me say good-bye!

01:28:08.183 --> 01:28:08.349 position:33% line:89% align:start
Impossible.

01:28:10.517 --> 01:28:13.586 position:7% line:83% align:start
Please, try not to do anything
that could be misinterpreted.

01:28:13.586 --> 01:28:15.020 position:7% line:83% align:start
Why is saying good-bye to the
man who saved my life wrong?

01:28:16.921 --> 01:28:20.123 position:5% line:77% align:start
Does our future princess intend
to show us another embarrassing
spectacle?

01:28:27.294 --> 01:28:27.826 position:33% line:89% align:start
Let me pass!

01:28:29.595 --> 01:28:30.429 position:24% line:89% align:start
Get out of my way!

01:28:31.829 --> 01:28:32.796 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is that an order?

01:28:35.632 --> 01:28:39.134 position:5% line:77% align:start
Could you refrain from ordering
our men until after you've
entered the Royal Family?

01:28:41.436 --> 01:28:45.471 position:13% line:77% align:start
Unless you learn how these
matters work, this will be
problematic...

01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:51.208 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now then, come over
here quietly...

01:28:51.208 --> 01:28:51.942 position:33% line:89% align:start
Stand back!

01:29:13.455 --> 01:29:14.855 position:21% line:89% align:start
Erm, this is...um...

01:29:24.394 --> 01:29:25.062 position:27% line:89% align:start
Let her through.

01:29:39.170 --> 01:29:39.770 position:38% line:89% align:start
Juana...

01:29:49.743 --> 01:29:51.078 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, sorry!

01:30:00.416 --> 01:30:01.150 position:30% line:83% align:start
- Who's that?
- Hell if I know.

01:30:11.457 --> 01:30:12.090 position:35% line:89% align:start
Charles...

01:30:12.924 --> 01:30:13.458 position:35% line:89% align:start
Charles...

01:30:14.525 --> 01:30:15.025 position:35% line:89% align:start
Charles...

01:31:31.104 --> 01:31:32.071 position:19% line:89% align:start
Charles is dancing...!

01:31:34.806 --> 01:31:36.408 position:38% line:89% align:start
Charles!

01:33:02.093 --> 01:33:03.993 position:21% line:89% align:start
Thank you, Charles!

01:33:03.993 --> 01:33:05.295 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you!
