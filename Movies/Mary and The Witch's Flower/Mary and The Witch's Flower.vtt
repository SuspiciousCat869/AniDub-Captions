Hi! I'm Mary Smith,

finished unpacking.

Oh, I doubt it.

I'm really sorry.

Don't worry.
You don't have to help out.
That's my job, hmm?

Oh.

Oh.

Oh, please, allow me.

Thank you, dear.

So, where
are we going today?
Somewhere nice?

Somewhere interesting?

Forgot to say.

00:06:01.845 --> 00:06:04.882 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh. So-- So I won't
be coming with you?

00:06:06.284 --> 00:06:10.188 position:27% line:77% align:start
We'll be back by 6:00.
Perhaps another day
we'll go out, hmm?

00:06:10.222 --> 00:06:13.059 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can watch TV
until we're back.

Oh, my, you're right.

00:06:22.636 --> 00:06:25.907 position:5% line:71% align:start
We should probably
get that looked at.
[Charlotte] Hmm. Yes, we should.

00:06:27.208 --> 00:06:30.645 position:5% line:77% align:start
Oh, by the way,
your parents called
earlier, Mary.

00:06:30.678 --> 00:06:32.580 position:27% line:83% align:start
Really?
Are they coming soon?

00:06:32.615 --> 00:06:34.850 position:5% line:83% align:start
They're not quite finished
with work yet,

00:06:34.884 --> 00:06:37.586 position:5% line:77% align:start
so it'll be
a little while longer
before they can come.

Oh, I see.

It's a good thing
you came here ahead of them.

00:06:42.894 --> 00:06:44.629 position:5% line:89% align:start
If you'd have come with them,

00:06:44.662 --> 00:06:47.932 position:16% line:77% align:start
you'd have started school
later than everybody else,
wouldn't you?

Once summer break's over,
the kids will be back,

the little blighters again.

I'm sorry, Mary.
We'll be sure to be
back home by supper.

if he needs any help.

Don't get in the way
of his work, now, Mary.

I'll take that
as a "no" then.

00:07:40.161 --> 00:07:42.029 position:50% line:89% align:start
See you later!

Have fun, Mary.

00:07:44.832 --> 00:07:47.069 position:50% line:83% align:start
Will you look
at her go?

00:07:47.102 --> 00:07:49.304 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're meant to look twice
before you leap.

00:07:49.338 --> 00:07:51.773 position:27% line:71% align:start
She hardly looks at all.

You know, I feel sorry for you
being born a black cat--

00:11:42.611 --> 00:11:44.480 position:5% line:89% align:start
everyone calling you unlucky.

00:11:45.448 --> 00:11:47.617 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can relate though.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:50.353 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've got
this frizzy red hair

00:11:50.386 --> 00:11:53.390 position:5% line:83% align:start
and no friends
to eat my lunch with.

00:11:56.059 --> 00:11:58.563 position:16% line:83% align:start
And I'm rubbish

It's not for lack of trying.

I wonder.

Isn't it lovely?

00:14:35.347 --> 00:14:37.315 position:5% line:89% align:start
I found it in the woods.

00:14:37.349 --> 00:14:39.317 position:5% line:89% align:start
I was following two cats.

00:14:39.351 --> 00:14:41.520 position:50% line:83% align:start
A gray one
and a black one.

00:14:41.554 --> 00:14:43.924 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hmm, I wonder
where they're from.

00:14:43.957 --> 00:14:47.361 position:5% line:83% align:start
The black one is Tib.
The gray one is Gib.

00:14:47.394 --> 00:14:49.730 position:5% line:83% align:start
They belong
to that young lad, Peter.

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:53.635 position:38% line:89% align:start
Peter.

00:14:53.668 --> 00:14:55.436 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ugh! Not him.

00:14:55.470 --> 00:15:00.442 position:5% line:77% align:start
[sighs]
Not that cats really belong
to anyone, of course.

00:15:00.476 --> 00:15:03.445 position:5% line:83% align:start
I must say,
I'm surprised you found this

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:07.818 position:5% line:83% align:start
on your first trip
to the forest, young lady.

00:15:07.852 --> 00:15:10.921 position:5% line:83% align:start
That flower's called
a "Fly-by-Night."

00:15:10.955 --> 00:15:13.190 position:50% line:77% align:start
Fly-by-Night?
Aye.

00:15:13.224 --> 00:15:17.929 position:5% line:77% align:start
That's her most common name,
though she's anything
but common.

00:15:17.963 --> 00:15:20.399 position:5% line:83% align:start
They only grow
in these woods,

00:15:20.432 --> 00:15:23.536 position:5% line:83% align:start
and they only bloom
once every seven years.

00:15:23.569 --> 00:15:28.308 position:5% line:77% align:start
In fact,
this is the first time
I've seen one.

00:15:28.342 --> 00:15:30.879 position:5% line:83% align:start
They say witches used
to seek it out.

00:15:30.912 --> 00:15:32.814 position:38% line:77% align:start
Witches?
Aye.

00:15:32.847 --> 00:15:35.617 position:16% line:89% align:start

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.753 position:38% line:89% align:start

Where's he gone?

No, not at all!

00:17:38.161 --> 00:17:40.931 position:5% line:83% align:start
Would you deliver this
for me?

00:17:40.964 --> 00:17:42.566 position:38% line:89% align:start
Of course I will.

00:17:42.599 --> 00:17:45.870 position:5% line:83% align:start
Here. I've written down
the name and address for you.

00:17:47.138 --> 00:17:49.540 position:38% line:83% align:start

00:31:06.974 --> 00:31:09.878 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't be scared, Tib.
I'm not scared.

00:31:09.911 --> 00:31:12.080 position:38% line:89% align:start
[meowing]

00:31:12.113 --> 00:31:15.283 position:61% line:77% align:start
[chittering]
Aaah!

00:31:20.356 --> 00:31:21.490 position:27% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:30.835 position:38% line:83% align:start
Oh-oh, you must be
the new girl.

00:31:30.868 --> 00:31:33.504 position:27% line:89% align:start
Greetings and good day.

00:31:33.539 --> 00:31:38.111 position:27% line:83% align:start
Welcome to you
and your familiar.

00:31:38.144 --> 00:31:43.449 position:16% line:77% align:start
Oh, uh, I think--
I think there may have been
some misunderstanding.

00:31:45.986 --> 00:31:49.356 position:27% line:83% align:start
With this lovely hair,
I doubt it.

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:51.626 position:5% line:89% align:start
I-I shouldn't be here.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:55.031 position:5% line:83% align:start
I hope you're not suggesting
you're some sort of trespasser.

00:31:55.064 --> 00:31:58.367 position:5% line:83% align:start
[whimpers]
Me? No, I'm the new girl.

00:31:58.401 --> 00:31:59.969 position:16% line:77% align:start
That's me.
Hmm.

00:32:00.003 --> 00:32:02.906 position:61% line:83% align:start
Of course.
Excellent.

00:32:11.416 --> 00:32:13.384 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:32:15.187 --> 00:32:17.756 position:38% line:89% align:start
[whistle blows]

00:32:28.569 --> 00:32:29.637 position:16% line:89% align:start
Uh!

00:32:30.973 --> 00:32:33.475 position:27% line:83% align:start
I am Headmistress
Mumblechook.

00:32:33.508 --> 00:32:35.010 position:27% line:89% align:start
And your name?

00:32:35.044 --> 00:32:38.081 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, um, Mary Smith, madam.

00:32:38.114 --> 00:32:40.950 position:16% line:83% align:start
Welcome to Endor College,
Mary Smith.

00:32:42.786 --> 00:32:44.655 position:27% line:89% align:start
Thanks.

00:32:47.058 --> 00:32:52.164 position:5% line:77% align:start
Hmm. You'll be pleased to know
this is the most exceptionally
exclusive college of magic.

00:32:52.198 --> 00:32:54.599 position:16% line:89% align:start
Only the chosen may enroll.

00:32:55.201 --> 00:32:57.603 position:16% line:89% align:start
College of magic?

00:32:58.738 --> 00:32:59.806 position:61% line:89% align:start
Come now.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:03.777 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let me assist and acquaint you
with our curious campus.

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:05.947 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh! [chuckling]

00:33:09.083 --> 00:33:11.719 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps] This is--

00:33:11.753 --> 00:33:14.056 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mumblechook]
This is the main hall.

00:33:14.089 --> 00:33:17.093 position:5% line:77% align:start
It is here
that we collect sunlight
to illuminate the college

00:33:17.127 --> 00:33:19.129 position:5% line:89% align:start
in all hours, all weather.

00:33:19.162 --> 00:33:22.166 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Mary] I was going
to say "amazing."

00:33:22.199 --> 00:33:25.703 position:5% line:83% align:start
[chuckling]
It is that as well.

00:33:28.941 --> 00:33:31.209 position:27% line:89% align:start
Look, Tib, over there.

00:33:31.243 --> 00:33:34.213 position:5% line:77% align:start
Morning, madam.
Marvelous morning.

00:33:34.247 --> 00:33:35.782 position:5% line:83% align:start
[boy] Look,
it's Madam Mumblechook.

00:33:35.815 --> 00:33:37.684 position:50% line:83% align:start
How do those
elevators work?

00:33:37.717 --> 00:33:39.686 position:5% line:89% align:start
They're electric, my dear.

00:33:39.719 --> 00:33:42.990 position:5% line:83% align:start
Electricity is also
a form of magic.

00:33:49.531 --> 00:33:50.966 position:50% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:33:52.268 --> 00:33:54.537 position:50% line:71% align:start
[whimpers]
Come and see
the classrooms,

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:56.605 position:5% line:83% align:start
and then we can discuss
enrollment.

00:33:56.639 --> 00:33:58.641 position:50% line:89% align:start
[gasping] Aaah!

00:34:03.047 --> 00:34:05.683 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Mumblechook humming]

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.857 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is
the first-year classroom.

00:34:11.890 --> 00:34:15.527 position:5% line:77% align:start
As you can see,
all first years have
broom-riding lessons.

00:34:15.561 --> 00:34:17.529 position:5% line:89% align:start
And up straight.

00:34:17.564 --> 00:34:21.801 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Mumblechook]
It can take up to a year
to master it completely.

00:34:21.836 --> 00:34:23.971 position:50% line:77% align:start
[Mary] I see.
[blubbering]

00:34:24.005 --> 00:34:26.741 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, but you wouldn't need
anywhere near a year.

00:34:26.774 --> 00:34:28.744 position:61% line:77% align:start
Why?
I saw you arrive.

00:34:28.777 --> 00:34:31.013 position:5% line:83% align:start
You were quite adept
with that broom.

00:34:31.046 --> 00:34:32.949 position:27% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

00:34:32.982 --> 00:34:36.019 position:5% line:77% align:start
Now,
let's have you see something
a little more specialized.

00:34:36.052 --> 00:34:37.687 position:61% line:89% align:start
Specialized?

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:41.692 position:5% line:77% align:start
Magic aeronautics,
magic history,
magic chemistry.

00:34:41.725 --> 00:34:44.628 position:5% line:83% align:start
We offer a multitude
of magical majors here.

00:34:44.661 --> 00:34:46.898 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah, but at Endor College,

00:34:46.931 --> 00:34:51.203 position:5% line:77% align:start
what we are best known for
are our courses
on transformation,

00:34:51.237 --> 00:34:53.172 position:5% line:89% align:start
decidedly the most difficult.

00:34:53.205 --> 00:34:54.807 position:50% line:89% align:start
I'm sure.

00:34:55.208 --> 00:34:56.675 position:50% line:89% align:start
Oh, dear.

00:34:57.944 --> 00:35:00.747 position:16% line:83% align:start
Seems like there'll be
an awful lot of studying.

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:05.053 position:38% line:83% align:start
What about sports
or field trips even?

00:35:05.086 --> 00:35:08.991 position:5% line:83% align:start
Certainly, there are
many recreations here.

00:35:09.024 --> 00:35:14.030 position:5% line:77% align:start
My personal favorite
is the aerial gymkhana,
held in December.

00:35:14.064 --> 00:35:16.800 position:5% line:83% align:start
At Endor, we cultivate
witches and warlocks

00:35:16.833 --> 00:35:21.005 position:5% line:83% align:start
who excel in mind,
body and spirit.

00:35:21.038 --> 00:35:23.007 position:50% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.642 position:38% line:89% align:start
Amazing!

00:35:24.675 --> 00:35:27.212 position:5% line:83% align:start
The dining hall
is state-of-the-art.

00:35:27.245 --> 00:35:29.281 position:5% line:83% align:start
Students eat
whatever they please.

00:35:29.315 --> 00:35:31.284 position:5% line:83% align:start
Every meal
is nutritionally balanced

00:35:31.317 --> 00:35:33.953 position:5% line:89% align:start
and mouthwateringly delicious.

00:35:33.986 --> 00:35:36.756 position:38% line:77% align:start
I think
my favorite subject
will be lunch.

00:35:38.759 --> 00:35:40.661 position:27% line:83% align:start
Mary, someone
with your talent

00:35:40.694 --> 00:35:43.198 position:5% line:83% align:start
would certainly be
a credit to Endor.

00:35:43.231 --> 00:35:45.366 position:5% line:89% align:start
Quite extraordinary.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.936 position:50% line:83% align:start
Talent?
Talent for what?

00:35:47.969 --> 00:35:51.307 position:5% line:83% align:start
As a witch, Mary Smith,
a remarkable witch.

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:55.312 position:5% line:77% align:start
Do you really think
I didn't see the insignia
on your hand?

00:35:55.345 --> 00:35:57.414 position:16% line:89% align:start
What? Oh. This.

00:35:57.447 --> 00:35:58.949 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, that.

00:35:58.982 --> 00:36:02.120 position:5% line:83% align:start
And no schooling,
yet look how much you can do.

00:36:02.153 --> 00:36:04.822 position:5% line:77% align:start
Witches your age
can barely sweep up
with a broom,

00:36:04.856 --> 00:36:06.425 position:5% line:89% align:start
let alone ride one.

00:36:06.458 --> 00:36:09.328 position:5% line:83% align:start
And you've somehow tamed
a perfect familiar.

00:36:09.361 --> 00:36:11.297 position:27% line:83% align:start
Thanks. I'm not used
to compliments.

00:36:11.331 --> 00:36:13.233 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm blushing, I think.

00:36:13.266 --> 00:36:15.802 position:5% line:83% align:start
My dear,
have a look and see...

00:36:17.404 --> 00:36:19.874 position:5% line:89% align:start
and see what I see.

00:36:19.907 --> 00:36:24.012 position:27% line:83% align:start
This red hair of yours,
like a burning flame.

00:36:24.045 --> 00:36:28.183 position:38% line:77% align:start
Red-haired witches
have always been
supremely superior.

00:36:28.216 --> 00:36:30.820 position:50% line:77% align:start
No other color
is more coveted
for witches.

00:36:30.853 --> 00:36:32.922 position:50% line:83% align:start
And on someone
like you--

00:36:35.024 --> 00:36:37.694 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're
a once-in-a-century talent.

00:36:39.397 --> 00:36:41.031 position:50% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:36:42.133 --> 00:36:44.169 position:5% line:89% align:start
[chuckling]

00:36:44.202 --> 00:36:46.137 position:38% line:89% align:start
[sparking]

00:36:46.172 --> 00:36:48.741 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Mumblechook]
This is the laboratory.

00:36:48.774 --> 00:36:52.445 position:5% line:77% align:start
In the second year,
you'll immerse yourself
in the study of chemistry.

00:36:52.479 --> 00:36:54.848 position:50% line:83% align:start
Chemistry?
Not magic?

00:36:54.881 --> 00:36:58.452 position:5% line:83% align:start
What is potion-making
but chemistry by another name,

00:36:58.486 --> 00:37:01.789 position:5% line:83% align:start
as the renowned Dr. Dee
is fond of saying?

00:37:01.822 --> 00:37:03.458 position:5% line:71% align:start
Surely
you've heard of him.
What?

00:37:03.492 --> 00:37:05.793 position:38% line:83% align:start
What? Um, yes,
of course I have.

00:37:05.827 --> 00:37:08.230 position:50% line:83% align:start
Um, Dr. Dee.
[chuckling]

00:37:09.332 --> 00:37:12.068 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hmm. I'd like you
to meet him.

00:37:12.101 --> 00:37:14.204 position:27% line:89% align:start
Doctor!

00:37:14.237 --> 00:37:15.939 position:5% line:89% align:start
Madam Mumblechook.

00:37:15.972 --> 00:37:18.342 position:5% line:89% align:start
You know I hate induction.

00:37:18.375 --> 00:37:19.843 position:16% line:89% align:start
I-I mean interruption.

00:37:19.877 --> 00:37:24.950 position:5% line:77% align:start
I am conducting
an analysis of the test results
we collected the other day.

00:37:24.983 --> 00:37:30.056 position:5% line:77% align:start
I must calibrate
every comparative compound
with absolute zero interference.

00:37:30.089 --> 00:37:34.328 position:5% line:83% align:start
My positive energy is being used
to devise meticulous plans.

00:37:34.361 --> 00:37:36.063 position:61% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:37:36.096 --> 00:37:39.467 position:5% line:77% align:start
Doctor, allow me to
introduce our newest pupil,
Miss Mary Smith.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.536 position:5% line:89% align:start
She is a genuine prodigy.

00:37:41.569 --> 00:37:44.105 position:16% line:83% align:start
And look at this
ravishing red hair.

00:37:44.138 --> 00:37:45.441 position:38% line:89% align:start
Indeed.

00:37:45.474 --> 00:37:47.876 position:16% line:83% align:start
Red, ruby, crimson,
scarlet, copper.

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:50.045 position:16% line:83% align:start
All marvelous colors.
Marvelous, yes.

00:37:50.079 --> 00:37:54.317 position:5% line:77% align:start
The recessive gene that causes
red hair only occurs in one to
two percent of the population.

00:37:54.351 --> 00:37:57.121 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I'm forgetting my manners.
How do you do, Miss Mary?

00:37:57.821 --> 00:37:59.890 position:27% line:89% align:start
H-- How do you do?

00:37:59.924 --> 00:38:01.460 position:38% line:89% align:start
Dr. Dee does well.

00:38:01.493 --> 00:38:04.563 position:27% line:77% align:start
And what he doesn't know
about science in magic,
he soon will.

00:38:04.596 --> 00:38:07.132 position:38% line:83% align:start
I have a question
for you, Mary.

00:38:07.165 --> 00:38:11.004 position:5% line:77% align:start
Now, if we have
two virtual worlds
in two different dimensions

00:38:11.037 --> 00:38:13.407 position:5% line:83% align:start
and call the one on the plane
of X "Pattern Turtle,"

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:16.910 position:5% line:77% align:start
and we call the dimension
that represents magic
"Pattern Crane,"

00:38:16.944 --> 00:38:19.947 position:5% line:77% align:start
which of the two patterns
do you think
is the more effective approach

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:22.384 position:5% line:89% align:start
in biogeochemical analysis, hmm?

00:38:22.417 --> 00:38:24.085 position:5% line:89% align:start
Any ideas?

00:38:24.119 --> 00:38:27.556 position:61% line:71% align:start
Um--
Pattern Turtle
or Pattern Crane?

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:30.226 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hmm. Turtle, I think.

00:38:30.259 --> 00:38:32.963 position:5% line:83% align:start
Turtle, you say?
That's impossible!

00:38:36.133 --> 00:38:39.037 position:16% line:83% align:start
No, you're right.
You may indeed be right.

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:41.005 position:27% line:83% align:start
You've carved out
a new path!

00:38:41.039 --> 00:38:43.242 position:5% line:77% align:start
Splendid, Mary, splendid!
[gasps]

Perhaps you should also head up
the festival committee.

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:51.446 position:50% line:89% align:start
Uh, maybe, but--

00:46:51.479 --> 00:46:53.749 position:5% line:83% align:start
And you can lead
the study tours.

00:46:53.782 --> 00:46:58.188 position:5% line:77% align:start
And wouldn't it be wonderful
if you could represent us
at the academic conference too?

00:46:58.221 --> 00:47:00.790 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, some people
might get a bit jealous,

00:47:00.824 --> 00:47:03.493 position:5% line:83% align:start
but no starting student
has ever been this talented.

00:47:03.526 --> 00:47:06.631 position:27% line:89% align:start
Madam, wait. I'm not.

00:47:06.664 --> 00:47:08.499 position:16% line:77% align:start
Not what?
It's not true.

00:47:08.532 --> 00:47:09.935 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm not talented.

00:47:09.968 --> 00:47:13.505 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can fly on the broom,
and I can become invisible,

00:47:13.538 --> 00:47:16.609 position:27% line:83% align:start
but it's all thanks
to a mysterious flower.

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:24.118 position:27% line:89% align:start
Flower?

00:47:24.151 --> 00:47:25.786 position:50% line:89% align:start
Uh--

00:47:27.222 --> 00:47:29.157 position:5% line:89% align:start
Did you say "a flower"?

00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:30.959 position:61% line:89% align:start
Well, uh--

00:47:30.992 --> 00:47:33.229 position:5% line:89% align:start
"A mysterious flower," Mary?

00:47:33.262 --> 00:47:34.897 position:50% line:89% align:start
Yes, but I--

00:47:34.931 --> 00:47:36.632 position:5% line:77% align:start
Where is it?
What?

00:47:36.666 --> 00:47:39.535 position:5% line:83% align:start
You appear to be hiding
something behind your back.

00:47:39.568 --> 00:47:42.873 position:38% line:89% align:start
Me? No. No, no, no.

00:47:42.906 --> 00:47:45.109 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then what is it
that you're holding?

00:47:45.143 --> 00:47:47.979 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, no, it's nothing.

00:47:48.012 --> 00:47:50.481 position:5% line:89% align:start
Show me your hands!

00:47:52.718 --> 00:47:54.086 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:47:54.119 --> 00:47:57.157 position:5% line:83% align:start
And what might this be,
my dear?

00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:58.825 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:48:00.994 --> 00:48:03.898 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, I don't recognize
these strange symbols.

00:48:03.931 --> 00:48:05.700 position:38% line:89% align:start
Ah! Hmph.

00:48:05.733 --> 00:48:09.104 position:5% line:83% align:start
"51 Village of Redmanor.
 To Peter."

00:48:09.137 --> 00:48:10.872 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:48:10.906 --> 00:48:13.943 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yes, you see,
the flower belongs to him.

00:48:13.977 --> 00:48:17.714 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't really understand
how it works myself.

00:48:17.747 --> 00:48:19.549 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:48:19.582 --> 00:48:22.252 position:27% line:83% align:start
Peter's very talented,
much more than me.

00:48:22.286 --> 00:48:25.556 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hmm. I'd like to keep this
if I may, Mary.

00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:28.093 position:61% line:83% align:start
Uh, sure.
[chuckles]

00:48:28.126 --> 00:48:31.831 position:5% line:77% align:start
Tremendous.
In that case, I'll go and fetch
the enrollment form, hmm?

00:48:31.864 --> 00:48:34.767 position:5% line:83% align:start
You'll fill it out,
and, um, bring it tomorrow.

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:36.103 position:5% line:89% align:start
All right?

00:48:36.136 --> 00:48:38.038 position:27% line:89% align:start
Uh, yes, ma'am.

00:48:43.044 --> 00:48:45.146 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, no need to see me off.

00:48:45.179 --> 00:48:47.648 position:16% line:89% align:start
I can find my own way.

00:48:48.616 --> 00:48:50.152 position:5% line:89% align:start
But thank you for today.

00:48:50.185 --> 00:48:54.157 position:16% line:77% align:start
And tomorrow we'll debate
the discontinuity
of Filio Functions.

00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:55.892 position:50% line:89% align:start
Look who's here.

00:48:58.995 --> 00:49:01.265 position:27% line:89% align:start
Uh, Mr. Flanagan!

00:49:01.298 --> 00:49:03.934 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, good to see you.
And my broomstick.

00:49:03.968 --> 00:49:07.806 position:61% line:71% align:start
Thanks.
Well, now, your mistress
has come back for you.

00:49:09.875 --> 00:49:11.077 position:16% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:14.013 position:16% line:83% align:start
But I'm not sure
I can find my own way home.

00:49:14.047 --> 00:49:16.182 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't worry.
The broomstick knows the way.

00:49:16.216 --> 00:49:18.052 position:50% line:77% align:start
[grunting]
Oh, that's good.

00:49:18.085 --> 00:49:19.920 position:61% line:89% align:start
[whimpers]

00:49:22.089 --> 00:49:24.025 position:16% line:89% align:start
Am I glad to see you.

00:49:24.059 --> 00:49:25.860 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now, nice and gentle.

00:49:25.894 --> 00:49:27.962 position:16% line:89% align:start
Come on, Tib. We're off now.

00:49:29.398 --> 00:49:32.301 position:27% line:89% align:start
Tib? What's the matter?

00:49:32.334 --> 00:49:35.805 position:5% line:77% align:start
He's a cat,
so he might just be sulking.
You never know with them.

00:49:35.838 --> 00:49:38.075 position:5% line:83% align:start
Or perhaps he doesn't
want to leave.

00:49:38.108 --> 00:49:41.778 position:5% line:83% align:start
Cats do have an affinity
for magic, after all.

00:49:42.914 --> 00:49:44.615 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:49:45.384 --> 00:49:46.952 position:16% line:89% align:start
Tib, let's go home.

00:49:46.985 --> 00:49:49.988 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll give you a nice saucer
of warm milk.

00:50:00.668 --> 00:50:03.804 position:16% line:77% align:start
-Good! Now, I want you
 to hold on tight.
-Okay.

00:50:08.777 --> 00:50:10.645 position:27% line:89% align:start
The girl's broomstick.

00:50:11.147 --> 00:50:12.315 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:50:12.348 --> 00:50:14.384 position:5% line:83% align:start
You've
a good broomstick there.

00:50:14.418 --> 00:50:16.153 position:50% line:89% align:start
Look after it.

00:50:16.186 --> 00:50:19.857 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Away!
-[screaming]

00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:22.827 position:16% line:89% align:start
I said gentler this time!

00:50:25.897 --> 00:50:27.866 position:27% line:89% align:start
Congratulations, madam.

00:50:27.899 --> 00:50:30.436 position:16% line:83% align:start
What a splendid witch
we have enrolling with us.

00:50:30.469 --> 00:50:33.005 position:27% line:83% align:start
She brings great promise
to Endor College.

00:50:33.038 --> 00:50:36.143 position:5% line:83% align:start
That girl has discovered
where the flowers are.

00:50:36.176 --> 00:50:38.379 position:38% line:89% align:start
A discovery indeed.

00:50:38.412 --> 00:50:40.781 position:27% line:83% align:start
What did you just say?
The flowers?

00:50:40.815 --> 00:50:43.117 position:50% line:77% align:start
You don't mean--
Yes.

00:50:43.151 --> 00:50:47.856 position:16% line:77% align:start
The stolen Fly-by-Nights?
How could you possibly
let her leave, madam?

00:50:49.791 --> 00:50:51.928 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's going to bring them
right to us.

00:50:59.003 --> 00:51:02.140 position:27% line:83% align:start
We have her
like a cat on a leash.

00:51:10.049 --> 00:51:11.784 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, the book!

00:51:11.817 --> 00:51:14.087 position:16% line:89% align:start
I shouldn't have taken it.

00:51:15.155 --> 00:51:18.058 position:27% line:89% align:start
Tib, are you okay?

00:51:18.091 --> 00:51:21.062 position:27% line:83% align:start
Are you cross with me?
I was scared.

00:51:21.095 --> 00:51:23.731 position:38% line:83% align:start
I-- I didn't mean
to take it.

00:51:23.765 --> 00:51:25.467 position:16% line:89% align:start
It just sort of happened.

00:51:25.501 --> 00:51:27.937 position:27% line:83% align:start
At least we got away
before madam realized.

00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:30.039 position:27% line:83% align:start
I thought she was going
to eat me alive.

00:51:30.072 --> 00:51:32.342 position:16% line:83% align:start
Anyone else would have done
the same thing.

Oh, my dear.

00:53:08.622 --> 00:53:10.990 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm not dreaming. I knew it.

00:53:12.359 --> 00:53:14.828 position:16% line:83% align:start
We were very worried,
you know, Mary.

00:53:24.373 --> 00:53:28.077 position:27% line:83% align:start
Mary, slow down.
You'll get indigestion.

Sorry,

has happened?

Are you okay?

01:06:42.007 --> 01:06:45.944 position:16% line:83% align:start
[chuckles]
Let's go home, shall we?

01:06:46.878 --> 01:06:48.347 position:61% line:83% align:start
All of us,
together.

01:06:50.316 --> 01:06:51.318 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

01:06:51.351 --> 01:06:54.788 position:27% line:83% align:start
Right.
Let's see now.

01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:57.358 position:27% line:83% align:start
Mary,
how did you get here?

01:06:57.392 --> 01:06:58.859 position:38% line:89% align:start
Me?

01:06:58.893 --> 01:07:01.162 position:16% line:89% align:start
I rode a broomstick.

01:07:01.195 --> 01:07:03.865 position:50% line:77% align:start
Broomstick?
What are you
talking about?

01:07:03.898 --> 01:07:05.200 position:38% line:83% align:start
Are you saying
you can use magic?

01:07:05.234 --> 01:07:08.837 position:16% line:83% align:start
Uh, yeah,
but only for tonight.

01:07:10.073 --> 01:07:11.207 position:27% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

01:07:14.044 --> 01:07:15.980 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's right. Tonight.

01:07:16.013 --> 01:07:18.416 position:5% line:89% align:start
I really am a witch.

01:07:25.257 --> 01:07:26.992 position:5% line:89% align:start
More acceleration.

01:07:27.025 --> 01:07:29.962 position:5% line:83% align:start
I need those children
in the laboratory at once!

01:07:31.532 --> 01:07:36.604 position:16% line:83% align:start
I mistrust that Mary Smith
with every atom of my body.

01:07:36.638 --> 01:07:39.474 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let me see now.
"Spell to unfasten locks."

01:07:39.507 --> 01:07:41.943 position:16% line:89% align:start
No. No.

01:07:41.976 --> 01:07:45.348 position:16% line:77% align:start
You can read this?
To smash a door down.

01:07:45.381 --> 01:07:49.051 position:27% line:77% align:start
No, we need something
that will
change everyone back.

01:07:49.085 --> 01:07:50.886 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Peter]
Just by chanting a spell?

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:54.891 position:16% line:77% align:start
I don't think anyone
can just chant them.
You have to have some power.

01:07:54.925 --> 01:07:58.396 position:5% line:77% align:start
So this power of yours,
when did you figure out
you first had it?

01:07:58.429 --> 01:07:59.897 position:50% line:89% align:start
Ah! I found it.

01:07:59.931 --> 01:08:02.234 position:5% line:89% align:start
"The spell to undo all magic."

01:08:02.267 --> 01:08:06.138 position:38% line:83% align:start
What's done is done,
until it's undone.

[both yelp]

01:08:49.756 --> 01:08:51.124 position:27% line:89% align:start

01:08:51.759 --> 01:08:54.161 position:50% line:89% align:start
Tib! Gib!

01:08:54.195 --> 01:08:57.999 position:5% line:77% align:start
What did you do?
What's going on?
[gasps]

01:08:58.032 --> 01:09:02.304 position:5% line:77% align:start
If I was able to undo the
transformation spells, it should
have worked on the doors too.

01:09:02.337 --> 01:09:04.139 position:5% line:71% align:start
[lion roars]
Come on, Peter.
Let's go!

01:09:05.575 --> 01:09:08.144 position:27% line:83% align:start
O-Okay.

[animals screeching]

We might get trampled here.
Best to get out of the way.

[growling]

01:09:38.781 --> 01:09:43.486 position:16% line:83% align:start
How can my magical locks
be broken?

01:09:43.519 --> 01:09:47.757 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's impossible!
I cast the spell myself!

01:09:47.791 --> 01:09:52.430 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Dr. Dee shouting] No!

[gasps]

01:10:09.249 --> 01:10:11.151 position:5% line:89% align:start
How could this have happened?

01:10:12.086 --> 01:10:15.423 position:27% line:89% align:start
No! No! No!

01:10:16.291 --> 01:10:19.294 position:27% line:83% align:start
Reveal, not conceal.
[gasps]

01:10:19.729 --> 01:10:21.263 position:38% line:89% align:start
My...

book of master spells!

01:10:31.809 --> 01:10:34.445 position:27% line:83% align:start
Ah, yes, look!
The door's open, Mary.

01:10:34.846 --> 01:10:36.180 position:61% line:89% align:start
Oh.

01:10:36.715 --> 01:10:38.450 position:50% line:89% align:start

Let's follow them.

01:11:33.181 --> 01:11:35.450 position:16% line:89% align:start
What are they doing?

01:11:36.484 --> 01:11:38.420 position:16% line:83% align:start
Clearly
they're trying to escape.

01:11:38.454 --> 01:11:39.722 position:5% line:89% align:start
But how have they done this?

01:11:40.689 --> 01:11:42.358 position:5% line:89% align:start
That girl, Dr. Dee!

01:11:42.391 --> 01:11:46.162 position:5% line:77% align:start
She's stolen
the master spell book.
After them!

01:11:57.309 --> 01:11:59.511 position:16% line:83% align:start
Okay, we can do this.
I know we can.

01:11:59.544 --> 01:12:00.847 position:38% line:77% align:start
Ready?
Wait!

Hey, new girl!
[both] Ah!

Little broomstick.

this little fella
all over the place?

01:12:13.662 --> 01:12:16.297 position:5% line:83% align:start
I told you to put it away

Ah!
Mr. Flanagan!

You need to have more respect
