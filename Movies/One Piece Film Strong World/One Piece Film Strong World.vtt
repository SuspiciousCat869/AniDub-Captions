Throughout the history
of this island,

00:25:46.981 --> 00:25:49.316 position:16% line:83% align:start
the native animals have
evolved in a strange,

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:50.618 position:30% line:89% align:start
rapid manner.

00:25:50.651 --> 00:25:52.920 position:5% line:89% align:start
Untouched by the outside world.

00:25:52.953 --> 00:25:56.957 position:16% line:83% align:start
This development is all
thanks to a plant called IQ.

00:25:56.991 --> 00:25:59.226 position:10% line:83% align:start
It manipulates the animal's
physical growth

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.762 position:24% line:83% align:start
to not only adapt
to the surroundings,

00:26:01.796 --> 00:26:04.632 position:21% line:83% align:start
but to aggressively
overcome them.

00:26:04.665 --> 00:26:06.133 position:10% line:89% align:start
Once we realized its effect,

00:26:06.167 --> 00:26:10.004 position:13% line:83% align:start
I harvested every last IQ
plant on the entire island.

00:26:10.037 --> 00:26:12.273 position:24% line:83% align:start

We didn't make it in time.

01:05:02.169 --> 01:05:04.405 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's just like the photo
from the newspaper.

01:05:04.438 --> 01:05:06.574 position:10% line:89% align:start
This is downright horrific.

01:05:06.608 --> 01:05:08.710 position:16% line:83% align:start
To think that bastard's
planning to do the same thing

01:05:08.743 --> 01:05:10.110 position:24% line:89% align:start
to the East Blue.

01:05:12.246 --> 01:05:13.447 position:35% line:89% align:start

Hey!

01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:16.684 position:30% line:83% align:start
Say something
if you can hear me!

01:05:16.718 --> 01:05:18.318 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Luffy!

01:05:18.352 --> 01:05:19.687 position:24% line:89% align:start
Are you out there?

01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:34.234 position:30% line:89% align:start
What happened?

01:05:34.268 --> 01:05:35.537 position:41% line:89% align:start
Luffy!

01:05:35.570 --> 01:05:37.539 position:38% line:83% align:start
[FRANKY]
This is messed up!

01:05:37.572 --> 01:05:38.606 position:13% line:89% align:start
C'mon, let's dig them out!

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:39.674 position:38% line:83% align:start
[BROOK]
Right!

01:05:44.779 --> 01:05:46.480 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're telling me
Shiki's the one behind

01:05:46.514 --> 01:05:49.316 position:16% line:83% align:start
all that stuff happening
in the East Blue?

01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:50.317 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ROBIN]
Yes.

01:05:51.653 --> 01:05:53.487 position:24% line:83% align:start
So, he's gonna let
those monsters loose

01:05:53.521 --> 01:05:56.423 position:19% line:83% align:start
on our hometowns just
like he did on this village.

01:05:56.457 --> 01:06:00.294 position:10% line:83% align:start
Evil bastard. Making us look
like a bunch of fools.

[USOPP]
Nami.

01:06:01.763 --> 01:06:03.631 position:21% line:83% align:start
She chose to go with
Shiki so that she could

01:06:03.665 --> 01:06:06.133 position:19% line:89% align:start
protect the East Blue.

01:06:06.166 --> 01:06:09.169 position:21% line:83% align:start
She saved our homes,
and she saved us.

01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:15.643 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CHOPPER]
Xiao! Are all of you okay?

01:06:18.813 --> 01:06:21.749 position:13% line:83% align:start
We got to the underground
shelter just in time.

01:06:21.783 --> 01:06:23.785 position:30% line:83% align:start
What you were
just talking about--

01:06:23.818 --> 01:06:25.319 position:7% line:89% align:start
You said that your home was--

01:06:25.352 --> 01:06:29.056 position:24% line:83% align:start
are you all really
from the East Blue?

01:06:29.089 --> 01:06:33.628 position:27% line:83% align:start
And that girl--
She's also from the East Blue?

01:06:33.661 --> 01:06:35.362 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah. That's right.

01:06:37.297 --> 01:06:40.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
How could we have said
those awful things?

01:06:40.133 --> 01:06:41.636 position:13% line:89% align:start
She was there in the room,

01:06:41.669 --> 01:06:43.538 position:21% line:83% align:start
and I was so callous
to say that Shiki

01:06:43.571 --> 01:06:46.139 position:5% line:89% align:start
was the East Blue's problem now.

01:06:46.173 --> 01:06:47.809 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't even imagine
how much I must have

01:06:47.842 --> 01:06:49.744 position:21% line:89% align:start
hurt that poor girl.

01:06:49.777 --> 01:06:52.346 position:13% line:83% align:start
[XIAO] I didn't even think
about the people there.

01:06:56.083 --> 01:06:59.521 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Xiao. Where'd ya get that?

01:06:59.554 --> 01:07:01.556 position:19% line:89% align:start
This? I just found it.

01:07:01.589 --> 01:07:03.758 position:27% line:83% align:start
It was laying on
the ground over there.

01:07:03.791 --> 01:07:05.292 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Can I see it for a sec?

01:07:10.565 --> 01:07:13.433 position:21% line:83% align:start
You and your family
are amazing people, Xiao.

01:07:13.467 --> 01:07:16.336 position:5% line:83% align:start
Your whole village was destroyed
by those huge monsters,

01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:18.640 position:24% line:83% align:start
but you're worried
about Nami's feelings.

01:07:18.673 --> 01:07:20.608 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're some of the
nicest people I've met,

01:07:20.642 --> 01:07:22.476 position:10% line:89% align:start
and I know a lot of people.

01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:25.078 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's nothing for you
to feel bad about.

01:07:25.112 --> 01:07:27.481 position:7% line:89% align:start
Shiki's the only bad guy here.

01:07:27.515 --> 01:07:30.518 position:19% line:83% align:start
And I'm gonna make him
pay for what he's done.

01:07:30.552 --> 01:07:32.352 position:24% line:89% align:start
So cheer up! Okay?

01:07:37.324 --> 01:07:38.593 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
What is it?

01:07:38.626 --> 01:07:40.127 position:33% line:89% align:start
A Tone Dial?

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.597 position:30% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] Yeah.
The same one Shiki sent us.

01:07:44.298 --> 01:07:46.099 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
If you get this message,

01:07:46.133 --> 01:07:49.503 position:13% line:83% align:start
please forgive me for not
saying goodbye in person.

01:07:49.537 --> 01:07:51.706 position:13% line:89% align:start
Nami left us a recording!

01:07:51.739 --> 01:07:53.675 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
This might be tough to hear,

01:07:53.708 --> 01:07:57.144 position:16% line:83% align:start
but I've made up my mind
to become Shiki's navigator.

01:07:57.177 --> 01:08:00.347 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's just-- Shiki is
a legendary pirate,

01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:03.450 position:19% line:83% align:start
and possibly the most
powerful man alive.

01:08:03.483 --> 01:08:06.754 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's nothing you could
do to match up to him.

01:08:06.788 --> 01:08:09.657 position:19% line:83% align:start
He's bound to kill you
if you come after me.

01:08:09.691 --> 01:08:11.391 position:7% line:89% align:start
And if you don't believe me--

01:08:16.296 --> 01:08:18.498 position:16% line:89% align:start
What the hell is this?!

01:08:20.668 --> 01:08:21.836 position:16% line:89% align:start
How could she say that?!

01:08:21.869 --> 01:08:24.171 position:21% line:83% align:start
You don't talk about
your own crew that way!

01:08:24.204 --> 01:08:25.640 position:7% line:89% align:start
Hey, come on, just calm down!

01:08:25.673 --> 01:08:27.842 position:13% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] What does she mean
we can't match up to him?

01:08:27.875 --> 01:08:30.511 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't believe she
would say that to us!

01:08:30.545 --> 01:08:32.179 position:16% line:89% align:start
Not to sound too harsh,

01:08:32.212 --> 01:08:34.749 position:13% line:83% align:start
but ya can't deny the dude
just kicked all your asses.

01:08:34.782 --> 01:08:35.883 position:30% line:89% align:start
No, he didn't!

01:08:35.917 --> 01:08:37.451 position:24% line:89% align:start
I just-- I mean...

01:08:37.484 --> 01:08:39.554 position:30% line:83% align:start
He was lucky!
He tricked us and--

01:08:39.587 --> 01:08:42.189 position:13% line:83% align:start
Please, Luffy, calm down!
And you shut up!

01:08:44.324 --> 01:08:45.693 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]

Because you're a liar.

01:11:48.009 --> 01:11:49.710 position:24% line:83% align:start
You have no plans

he got the upper hand

and buried me
in that dirt thing,

Well, that stupid message!

01:48:37.151 --> 01:48:39.653 position:24% line:83% align:start
Did you not listen
to the whole thing?

01:48:39.687 --> 01:48:41.322 position:19% line:83% align:start
Luffy, she had to make
it sound convincing

01:48:41.355 --> 01:48:42.656 position:24% line:89% align:start
in front of Shiki.

have a choice.

and stormed off.

These things are valuable! Hey!

Luffy!

Come on, Nami!
We can still use it!

If you get this message...

01:49:30.071 --> 01:49:32.940 position:10% line:83% align:start
[NAMI] Quit listening to it!
Just give it to me!

[LUFFY]
I wanna hear it!

This might be tough to hear,

01:49:36.243 --> 01:49:39.680 position:10% line:83% align:start
but I've made up my mind to
become Shiki's navigator.

01:49:39.713 --> 01:49:42.850 position:33% line:83% align:start
It's just--
Shiki is a legendary pirate,

01:49:42.883 --> 01:49:45.319 position:19% line:83% align:start
and possibly the most
powerful man alive.

01:49:50.357 --> 01:49:53.294 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's nothing you could
do to match up to him.

01:49:53.327 --> 01:49:55.596 position:19% line:83% align:start
He's bound to kill you
if you come after me.

01:50:05.106 --> 01:50:06.340 position:7% line:89% align:start
And if you don't believe me...

01:50:09.910 --> 01:50:12.279 position:19% line:83% align:start
Then prove me wrong...
and save me.
