00:09:17.224 --> 00:09:18.258 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well then, we're outta here.

00:09:19.159 --> 00:09:20.227 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Okabe] Okay.

00:09:22.329 --> 00:09:25.299 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] <i>There was a reason</i>
 <i>we started working</i> .

00:09:25.332 --> 00:09:27.601 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>I heard that when Ezo was still</i>
 <i>called Hokkaido,</i>

00:09:27.634 --> 00:09:29.470 position:7% line:89% align:start
 <i>and was part of this country,</i>

00:09:29.503 --> 00:09:32.973 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>there was a plan to dig a tunnel</i>
 <i>underneath the Tsugaru Strait.</i>

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:37.111 position:7% line:89% align:start
 <i>It ended up being interrupted</i>

00:09:37.144 --> 00:09:39.646 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>because of the North-South</i>
 <i>division,</i>

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.982 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>but around this area in</i>

00:09:49.423 --> 00:09:52.626 position:27% line:77% align:start
 <i>In one of those</i>

 <i>on top of this mountain,</i>

00:09:52.659 --> 00:09:56.096 position:13% line:83% align:start

 <i>since last year.</i>

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.132 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>The reason we worked at</i>
 <i>Emishi Plant,</i>

00:09:58.165 --> 00:10:00.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>a US subcontracted</i>
 <i>military factory,</i>

00:10:01.001 --> 00:10:04.138 position:5% line:83% align:start

 <i>for what we were building.</i>

00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:06.106 position:27% line:83% align:start
 <i>That place that,</i>
 <i>even though we could see it</i>

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.275 position:38% line:83% align:start
 <i>so close</i>

00:10:08.308 --> 00:10:10.544 position:27% line:89% align:start
 <i>we couldn't go.</i>

00:10:10.577 --> 00:10:13.680 position:7% line:83% align:start

00:10:13.714 --> 00:10:16.316 position:19% line:83% align:start

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.051 position:27% line:89% align:start
 <i>No matter what.</i>

00:10:22.689 --> 00:10:24.691 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] Looks like a lot
of snow melted.

00:10:24.725 --> 00:10:26.627 position:16% line:89% align:start
I want to start up again.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.530 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] Yeah, if we don't
get any more.

00:10:29.563 --> 00:10:33.033 position:38% line:77% align:start
[Takuya]
At any rate, we'd better get the
rest of the materials we need.

00:10:33.066 --> 00:10:36.437 position:24% line:77% align:start
We still don't have
the outer nanonet or
the self-starting motor.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.039 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] The big thing's the
superconducting motor.

00:10:39.072 --> 00:10:42.109 position:19% line:83% align:start
And we'll need kerosene
too, man...

00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:45.179 position:10% line:83% align:start
We might not earn enough with
just the work from tomorrow.

00:10:45.212 --> 00:10:48.182 position:38% line:77% align:start
[Hiroki]
It'll work out, somehow. We have
summer break too, you know.

00:10:48.215 --> 00:10:51.351 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that's true.

00:10:51.385 --> 00:10:55.155 position:10% line:77% align:start
[Hiroki] <i>So we were planning</i>

Bella Ciela.

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:54.114 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Sayuri] That same

00:12:08.362 --> 00:12:09.596 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] Sayuri.

00:12:11.532 --> 00:12:13.567 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Sayuri] Takuya...

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.351 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] So you-
[Sayuri] Oh, uh-

00:12:31.385 --> 00:12:32.686 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] Sorry.

00:12:32.719 --> 00:12:34.421 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Sayuri] It's okay.

00:12:37.658 --> 00:12:38.692 position:10% line:89% align:start
[in unison] Hiroki said that-

00:12:43.463 --> 00:12:45.332 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggle]

00:12:45.365 --> 00:12:50.337 position:7% line:83% align:start
We haven't spent too much time
alone together, have we?

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.738 position:27% line:89% align:start
You may be right.

00:12:53.307 --> 00:12:56.610 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Sayuri] So, Takuya,
do you like physics?

00:12:56.643 --> 00:12:59.780 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] Oh, this book?
Yeah, I'm interested in it.

00:12:59.814 --> 00:13:01.515 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Sayuri] That's amazing.

00:13:01.548 --> 00:13:03.717 position:16% line:83% align:start
I was told my grandfather
was a physicist.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.520 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] Really?
Well, that's certainly more

00:13:06.553 --> 00:13:08.455 position:30% line:83% align:start
amazing than my
interest in the subject.

00:13:08.488 --> 00:13:10.490 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Sayuri] Though,
I've never met him.

00:13:10.524 --> 00:13:12.159 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] Because of the
North-South division?

00:13:12.192 --> 00:13:13.293 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Sayuri] Yeah...

00:13:13.327 --> 00:13:14.428 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] I see...

00:13:18.765 --> 00:13:22.603 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sayuri] Hey, you guys are still
working, right? Is it fun?

00:13:22.636 --> 00:13:26.340 position:38% line:77% align:start
[Takuya]
I don't know. The factory's
owned by this scary old man.

00:13:26.373 --> 00:13:28.575 position:13% line:83% align:start
He works us pretty hard and
yells at us a lot.

00:13:28.609 --> 00:13:30.210 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Sayuri] Is he that scary?

00:13:30.243 --> 00:13:31.445 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] He's a demon.

00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:32.746 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Sayuri] Really?

00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:34.648 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] You wanna come
see the place?

00:13:34.681 --> 00:13:37.417 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Sayuri] Won't I be in
your way, though?

00:13:37.451 --> 00:13:39.686 position:5% line:89% align:start
No and Hiroki'd like to see you.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.889 position:19% line:89% align:start
Great! Then I'll come!

00:13:41.923 --> 00:13:43.624 position:10% line:83% align:start
[speaker] The train bound for
Kanita and Minmaya...

00:13:43.657 --> 00:13:45.759 position:13% line:89% align:start
is arriving at Platform 2.

00:13:45.792 --> 00:13:48.762 position:16% line:83% align:start
Please step back and wait
behind the white line.

00:13:50.364 --> 00:13:51.732 position:27% line:89% align:start
Um, hey, Takuya?

00:13:53.533 --> 00:13:56.403 position:16% line:83% align:start
This might sound strange,
so you promise not to laugh?

00:13:56.436 --> 00:13:59.239 position:10% line:89% align:start
What? Tell me, I won't laugh.

00:13:59.272 --> 00:14:00.875 position:16% line:89% align:start
Okay then, I'll tell you.

00:14:00.908 --> 00:14:02.810 position:27% line:89% align:start
[train arriving]

00:14:19.226 --> 00:14:20.928 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why did you do something
like that without asking?

00:14:20.962 --> 00:14:22.596 position:13% line:89% align:start
What was I supposed to do?

00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:25.565 position:7% line:83% align:start
The conversation was just going
in that direction.

00:14:34.909 --> 00:14:36.576 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] What do we do?

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:38.946 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do we tell her about
flying to the Tower too?

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.882 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] That wouldn't be
a good idea.

00:14:40.915 --> 00:14:42.083 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] Right...

00:14:42.116 --> 00:14:44.584 position:7% line:83% align:start
So what do we say if she wants
to know where we're going?

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.958 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey there...

00:14:50.992 --> 00:14:52.225 position:27% line:89% align:start
[in unison] Huh?!

00:15:03.938 --> 00:15:06.974 position:35% line:89% align:start
Uh, hello.

00:15:07.008 --> 00:15:08.810 position:21% line:89% align:start
Man, is it hot today-

00:15:08.843 --> 00:15:10.677 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hello, Sir. How are you?

00:15:10.711 --> 00:15:12.312 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hello there. Sorry.

00:15:12.345 --> 00:15:14.281 position:33% line:89% align:start
Well... uh...

00:15:14.314 --> 00:15:17.317 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Okabe] So the kids have told
me an awful lot about you.

00:15:18.452 --> 00:15:24.458 position:30% line:89% align:start
[jet overhead]

00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:25.827 position:33% line:89% align:start
Mr. Okabe...

00:15:26.493 --> 00:15:27.995 position:30% line:89% align:start
Was he single?

00:15:28.029 --> 00:15:30.865 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nah, I heard he was
divorced once.

00:15:30.898 --> 00:15:33.533 position:38% line:77% align:start
[Hiroki]
Somehow that makes sense.
[Okabe] Well thank you so much!

00:15:39.506 --> 00:15:41.909 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Sayuri] I didn't know a place
like this existed!

00:15:41.943 --> 00:15:42.977 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's so big!

00:15:55.756 --> 00:15:58.492 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Sayuri] Amazing! An airplane?

00:15:58.525 --> 00:15:59.793 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:16:01.495 --> 00:16:03.797 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are you two building
this yourselves?

00:16:03.831 --> 00:16:04.999 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki]
Yeah. We've been working

00:16:05.032 --> 00:16:07.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
little by little since
the year two summer.

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:09.569 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] We're working at the
factory to pay for parts.

00:16:09.603 --> 00:16:11.638 position:16% line:83% align:start
Mr. Okabe's been helping
us a lot.

00:16:11.671 --> 00:16:13.507 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] Right?
[Hiroki] Mmhmm...

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.709 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] It's still far from
being finished though.

00:16:15.742 --> 00:16:17.277 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Sayuri] It's amazing...

00:16:19.013 --> 00:16:20.680 position:33% line:89% align:start
It really is!

00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:24.551 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Hiroki] Thanks...

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:52.746 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hey, when is the airplane going
to be finished?

00:16:52.779 --> 00:16:54.347 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] We actually want
to complete it

00:16:54.381 --> 00:16:56.083 position:13% line:89% align:start
during the summer break...

00:16:56.117 --> 00:16:58.085 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] But we probably
can't do it.

00:16:58.119 --> 00:17:00.855 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] Seems like it's gonna
take a lot more time.

00:17:00.888 --> 00:17:03.623 position:7% line:83% align:start
Our goal is to finish it before
the end of the year.

00:17:03.657 --> 00:17:04.892 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Sayuri] I see...

00:17:04.926 --> 00:17:07.929 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, where are you going
in your plane?

00:17:09.831 --> 00:17:11.731 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] We're going to
that tower.

00:17:15.002 --> 00:17:17.337 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Sayuri] Tower? You mean the
Union Tower?

00:17:20.141 --> 00:17:21.341 position:38% line:89% align:start
Mmhmm...

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:24.111 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] We think it'll take
about 40 minutes to fly there.

00:17:24.145 --> 00:17:26.948 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] The question is how
we cross the border,

00:17:26.981 --> 00:17:29.382 position:16% line:83% align:start
but we've got some ideas
about that, too.

00:17:29.416 --> 00:17:33.687 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Sayuri] Wow!
Hokkaido sounds great!

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.122 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] You wanna go
with us, Sayuri?

00:17:35.156 --> 00:17:37.457 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Sayuri] What? Is it okay?

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:38.692 position:24% line:89% align:start
[in unison] Mmhmm!

00:17:38.725 --> 00:17:42.063 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Sayuri] Really? Yes, I'll go!
I wanna go!

00:17:42.096 --> 00:17:43.697 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wow! Thank you!

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.867 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I don't know if
it'll be able to fly.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.002 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't worry! It'll fly!

00:17:48.035 --> 00:17:49.136 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Sayuri] Yeah!

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.471 position:13% line:89% align:start
Okay, then it's a promise!

00:17:51.504 --> 00:17:52.706 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] Yeah.

00:17:52.739 --> 00:17:54.608 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Hiroki] It's a promise.

00:17:54.641 --> 00:17:55.742 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Sayuri] Okay!

00:18:03.117 --> 00:18:04.952 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Hiroki] <i>In those days,</i>

00:18:04.986 --> 00:18:08.622 position:13% line:77% align:start
 <i>I felt that time and place</i>

Of course I'll sell you kerosene

00:19:21.262 --> 00:19:23.965 position:7% line:89% align:start
But jet fuel? That's expensive.

00:19:23.998 --> 00:19:26.566 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why don't you just use a
reciprocating engine,

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:28.635 position:13% line:89% align:start
or a superconducting motor?

Hold on a second,

00:19:56.897 --> 00:19:59.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
there were a lot of other

Oh, that one!

That's not it!

[Hiroki]
What was it?

00:20:05.638 --> 00:20:07.975 position:16% line:83% align:start
Remember, the reason for
making it a dual engine?

00:20:08.009 --> 00:20:09.276 position:7% line:89% align:start
There was a good reason for it.

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:10.610 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] Oh, that was it!

00:20:10.643 --> 00:20:12.046 position:16% line:83% align:start
[in unison] We wanted it

00:20:47.948 --> 00:20:49.817 position:16% line:89% align:start
I feel kind of nervous...

00:21:05.266 --> 00:21:12.306 position:44% line:89% align:start
[♪♪]

00:21:52.813 --> 00:21:54.982 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] Nanonet doesn't
reflect radar, does it?

00:21:55.015 --> 00:21:57.218 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] But we're going to be
flying in the buffer area.

00:21:57.251 --> 00:22:00.988 position:16% line:83% align:start
Even if it has a nanonet
exterior, if we fly carelessly,

00:22:01.021 --> 00:22:04.291 position:10% line:83% align:start
the US military will spot us
before the Union does.

00:22:05.758 --> 00:22:07.128 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] I guess we don't have
any other choice...

00:22:07.161 --> 00:22:09.662 position:10% line:83% align:start
but to fly as low as possible
and mix in the wave

00:22:09.696 --> 00:22:11.265 position:13% line:89% align:start
and the shape of the land.

00:22:11.298 --> 00:22:12.799 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] If we leave
early in the morning,

00:22:12.833 --> 00:22:14.802 position:30% line:83% align:start
we can hide in
the morning haze, too.

00:22:14.835 --> 00:22:16.270 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Hiroki] We have a map of Ezo?

00:22:16.303 --> 00:22:17.538 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] This is the only
detailed one.

00:22:17.571 --> 00:22:20.841 position:7% line:83% align:start
We won't know the actual shape
of the land until we go there,

00:22:20.875 --> 00:22:23.344 position:10% line:83% align:start
so we'll have to measure the
altitude after landing.

00:22:23.377 --> 00:22:25.346 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] But isn't it the case
that so long as we land,

00:22:25.379 --> 00:22:28.015 position:16% line:83% align:start
the Union's radars won't
catch us?

00:22:28.048 --> 00:22:29.416 position:27% line:83% align:start
The <i>Bella Ciela's</i>
radar profile

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:31.751 position:19% line:83% align:start
should be smaller than
a small bird, right?

00:22:31.784 --> 00:22:36.056 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] Probably... Unless
we're really, really unlucky.

[Hiroki] Hey, Takuya...

00:25:50.584 --> 00:25:52.419 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Sayuri] I was having
a dream earlier.

00:25:52.453 --> 00:25:54.955 position:24% line:89% align:start
Just for a second.

00:25:54.988 --> 00:25:57.191 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] A dream?
What kind of dream?

00:25:57.224 --> 00:26:01.128 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Sayuri] Hmm...
I forgot, actually.

00:26:01.161 --> 00:26:04.231 position:13% line:83% align:start
But it was probably a dream
about that Tower.

00:26:04.264 --> 00:26:06.367 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] It's a pretty amazing
view, isn't it?

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.169 position:16% line:89% align:start
The Union is incredible.

00:26:09.203 --> 00:26:13.407 position:21% line:77% align:start

the top of the Tower could
even lead to some other world.

A modified filtering for

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.602 position:19% line:83% align:start
Said to be the designer
of the Tower.

00:28:21.635 --> 00:28:22.569 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] Got it!

00:28:22.603 --> 00:28:26.473 position:21% line:83% align:start
XA, YC, ZC: confirmed
exposure reactions.

00:28:26.507 --> 00:28:29.276 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] There are five,
no, six branch universes!

00:28:29.309 --> 00:28:33.347 position:19% line:83% align:start
Six, huh? Alright then,
begin the harmonization stage.

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.582 position:19% line:89% align:start
Beginning Phase Three.

00:28:35.616 --> 00:28:37.584 position:10% line:83% align:start
And starting the approach to
connect closest parallel world.

00:28:39.086 --> 00:28:40.254 position:21% line:89% align:start
[student] Roger that!

00:28:45.659 --> 00:28:47.628 position:33% line:89% align:start
He's so fast!

00:28:47.661 --> 00:28:49.530 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Arisaka] Shirakawa is the
closest one.

00:28:49.563 --> 00:28:52.165 position:16% line:83% align:start
Twelve more Exa to reach
the connectable territory,

00:28:52.199 --> 00:28:55.602 position:16% line:89% align:start
11... 10... 9.4... 9.2...

00:28:55.636 --> 00:28:57.271 position:38% line:89% align:start
[beeping]

00:28:57.304 --> 00:28:59.306 position:27% line:89% align:start
It got connected!

00:28:59.339 --> 00:29:02.142 position:38% line:77% align:start
[Takuya]
Successful connection to one of
the nearby branch universes.

00:29:02.175 --> 00:29:04.177 position:13% line:89% align:start
Exposure reactions stable.

00:29:04.211 --> 00:29:06.446 position:27% line:83% align:start
Good. Move on to
conversion stage.

00:29:07.447 --> 00:29:09.216 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Arisaka] Starting the
4th Phase,

00:29:09.249 --> 00:29:11.285 position:27% line:83% align:start
space replacement
with the parallel world.

00:29:11.318 --> 00:29:13.387 position:10% line:83% align:start
So that spiral is the Tower,
I take it?

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:14.421 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes, that's right.

00:29:14.454 --> 00:29:16.790 position:21% line:83% align:start
We'll replace several
square inches of space

00:29:16.824 --> 00:29:19.159 position:24% line:83% align:start
in the center with
that of a different universe.

00:29:19.192 --> 00:29:22.830 position:16% line:77% align:start
[Arisaka] I've confirmed
a disparate matter conversion
of 60 nanoradius space.

00:29:22.864 --> 00:29:24.364 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's expanding rapidly.

00:29:24.398 --> 00:29:26.400 position:27% line:83% align:start
Naked eye visual
confirmation soon.

00:29:26.433 --> 00:29:28.535 position:33% line:83% align:start
That one part
is a completely different space

00:29:28.569 --> 00:29:30.704 position:35% line:83% align:start
composed of
a different universe.

00:29:30.737 --> 00:29:34.341 position:7% line:83% align:start
Is this the same operation that
the Ezo Tower's doing?

00:29:34.374 --> 00:29:37.611 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yes, although that is on a much
larger scale.

00:29:37.644 --> 00:29:40.280 position:10% line:83% align:start
We're still at a point where
we only succeed once every

00:29:40.314 --> 00:29:43.717 position:10% line:83% align:start
few tries replacing the space
the size of a grain of sand.

00:29:50.524 --> 00:29:51.525 position:21% line:89% align:start
We've got a problem.

00:29:51.893 --> 00:29:53.126 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's not good!

00:29:54.062 --> 00:29:54.862 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Arisaka] Exposure
reactions decreasing.

00:29:54.896 --> 00:29:55.729 position:21% line:83% align:start
We can't keep up the
connection...

00:29:55.762 --> 00:29:57.497 position:19% line:83% align:start
with the parallel world
any longer.

00:29:59.466 --> 00:30:01.635 position:41% line:89% align:start
[beep]

00:30:07.641 --> 00:30:09.276 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Arisaka] The wave
function converged.

00:30:09.309 --> 00:30:11.445 position:24% line:83% align:start
The branch universe
completely disappeared.

00:30:11.478 --> 00:30:14.816 position:16% line:83% align:start
We succeeded in replacing
1.3mm of disparate matter.

00:30:21.622 --> 00:30:24.224 position:30% line:89% align:start
[door opening]

00:30:24.257 --> 00:30:25.359 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Maki] Have a good day.

00:30:25.392 --> 00:30:26.326 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Arisaka] Oh, you, too.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.763 position:24% line:83% align:start
Professor Tomizawa,
is Shirakawa free now?

00:30:29.796 --> 00:30:32.766 position:19% line:83% align:start
He is. You two sure are
spending a lot of time together.

00:30:32.799 --> 00:30:34.301 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Maki]
You're the one who asked me

00:30:34.334 --> 00:30:36.570 position:21% line:83% align:start
to be with him until
he gets used to this place.

00:30:36.603 --> 00:30:38.772 position:10% line:89% align:start
Did I? Oh, by the way, Maki,

00:30:38.806 --> 00:30:40.842 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm going to Tokyo on
business tomorrow.

00:30:40.875 --> 00:30:42.776 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Maki] It's the research report
meeting, right?

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:46.680 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Tomizawa] That too, but it
seems they found the key.

00:30:46.713 --> 00:30:49.483 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Maki] The key? The one
you told me about before?

00:30:49.516 --> 00:30:50.717 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Tomizawa] Yeah.

00:30:50.751 --> 00:30:53.153 position:13% line:83% align:start
Your Brain Science team may
start putting in longer hours.

00:30:53.687 --> 00:30:55.722 position:30% line:89% align:start
[door opening]

00:30:55.756 --> 00:30:57.290 position:41% line:89% align:start
Maki...

00:31:05.265 --> 00:31:07.902 position:24% line:83% align:start
The military seems
to be here a lot.

00:31:07.935 --> 00:31:10.337 position:19% line:83% align:start
The one in the suit is
probably NSA.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:11.772 position:44% line:89% align:start
NSA?

00:31:11.806 --> 00:31:13.473 position:10% line:89% align:start
The National Security Agency.

00:31:13.507 --> 00:31:16.878 position:7% line:83% align:start
I see. There have been a lot of
terrorism rumors lately.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.416 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Maki] Did it go well today?

00:31:22.449 --> 00:31:24.284 position:27% line:89% align:start
Not well enough.

00:31:24.317 --> 00:31:26.821 position:7% line:83% align:start
Best we can do is barely naked
eye visual replacement.

00:31:26.854 --> 00:31:29.623 position:13% line:83% align:start
And we're still far behind
the Union's Tower.

00:31:29.656 --> 00:31:32.626 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Maki] You can't help it since
they're so far ahead of us.

00:31:32.659 --> 00:31:35.562 position:24% line:83% align:start
And they have been,
even with basic physics.

00:31:35.595 --> 00:31:36.864 position:21% line:89% align:start
Since the beginning.

00:31:37.865 --> 00:31:39.033 position:41% line:89% align:start
[ding]

00:31:42.669 --> 00:31:44.271 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] We don't know why
the disparate matter conversion

00:31:44.304 --> 00:31:46.673 position:19% line:83% align:start
stops at a 2 km radius
point from the Tower.

00:31:47.975 --> 00:31:50.978 position:13% line:83% align:start
If it's to attack enemies,
it doesn't work.

00:31:51.012 --> 00:31:53.915 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's function may be suspended
by some accident...

00:31:53.948 --> 00:31:57.317 position:19% line:83% align:start
Or maybe it's simply an
experimental facility.

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:59.252 position:27% line:83% align:start
Or the disparate
matter conversion itself

00:31:59.286 --> 00:32:02.456 position:21% line:83% align:start
is a function that's
somehow out of control.

00:32:02.489 --> 00:32:05.592 position:10% line:83% align:start
Professor Tomizawa says there
may be some external cause

00:32:05.625 --> 00:32:07.527 position:19% line:83% align:start
that's suppressing the
Tower's function.

00:32:15.602 --> 00:32:17.905 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Maki] Hey, Shirakawa...
What are you doing tomorrow?

00:32:17.939 --> 00:32:20.474 position:24% line:83% align:start
Your high school's
on break, right?

00:32:20.507 --> 00:32:22.342 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's something
I want to research.

00:32:22.375 --> 00:32:23.477 position:30% line:89% align:start
At the library?

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:25.980 position:24% line:83% align:start
No. I'm going to a
friend's factory.

00:32:26.013 --> 00:32:27.882 position:16% line:83% align:start
What do you mean you want
to see the factory?

00:32:27.915 --> 00:32:29.349 position:19% line:89% align:start
We don't do tours here!

00:32:29.382 --> 00:32:31.018 position:21% line:89% align:start
Huh? What'd you say?

00:32:31.052 --> 00:32:33.587 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Okabe] A girl? How old is she?

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:35.890 position:21% line:89% align:start
I don't really know.

00:32:35.923 --> 00:32:38.425 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] I think she's kind
of pretty though...

00:32:38.458 --> 00:32:40.794 position:13% line:83% align:start
Okay! Then I'll be waiting
for ya.

00:32:57.912 --> 00:32:59.346 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Maki] Wow.

00:32:59.379 --> 00:33:01.381 position:19% line:89% align:start
What amazing antennas!

00:33:02.749 --> 00:33:04.018 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, I've got to be
honest with you,

00:33:04.051 --> 00:33:06.020 position:24% line:83% align:start
some of them aren't
exactly legal.

00:33:06.053 --> 00:33:08.588 position:10% line:83% align:start
But they can connect to some
pretty interesting places.

00:33:08.622 --> 00:33:09.756 position:38% line:89% align:start
I bet...

00:33:13.861 --> 00:33:16.363 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Okabe] And you specialize
in brain research,

00:33:16.396 --> 00:33:17.464 position:16% line:89% align:start
is that right Miss Maki?

00:33:17.497 --> 00:33:20.935 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Maki] Yes. Things like
memories, sleep, dreams...

00:33:20.968 --> 00:33:23.737 position:35% line:77% align:start
[worker b]
You work at the same research
lab as Takuya, don't you?

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:26.040 position:24% line:83% align:start
I thought you were
researching the Tower.

00:33:26.073 --> 00:33:28.508 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] Yes, I do research
on the Tower...

00:33:28.542 --> 00:33:30.077 position:27% line:89% align:start
How can I put it?

00:33:30.111 --> 00:33:33.780 position:13% line:83% align:start
We both do research dealing
with parallel worlds.

00:33:33.815 --> 00:33:35.950 position:13% line:89% align:start
[worker b] Parallel worlds?

00:33:35.983 --> 00:33:38.785 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, just like a person
dreams at night,

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:41.555 position:13% line:89% align:start
the universe also "dreams".

00:33:41.588 --> 00:33:44.091 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Maki] This world's hiding
various possibilities of...

00:33:44.125 --> 00:33:47.094 position:10% line:83% align:start
It-could-have-been-like-this
in its dreams.

00:33:47.128 --> 00:33:50.097 position:7% line:83% align:start
We call them "parallel worlds"
or "branch universes."

00:33:52.934 --> 00:33:54.869 position:10% line:83% align:start
My research is to investigate
the effects

00:33:54.902 --> 00:33:56.037 position:16% line:89% align:start
that the parallel worlds

00:33:56.070 --> 00:34:00.074 position:19% line:83% align:start
have on people's brains
and dreams.

00:34:00.107 --> 00:34:02.109 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Maki] The dominant view is
that the Union's Tower

00:34:02.143 --> 00:34:05.412 position:27% line:83% align:start
is also observing
those same things.

00:34:05.445 --> 00:34:07.380 position:27% line:83% align:start
While we can now
observe parallel worlds

00:34:07.414 --> 00:34:08.883 position:27% line:89% align:start
using technology,

00:34:08.916 --> 00:34:11.551 position:16% line:83% align:start
the brains of life forms
may have been perceiving it

00:34:11.585 --> 00:34:14.588 position:24% line:83% align:start
unconsciously from
ancient times.

00:34:14.621 --> 00:34:17.757 position:5% line:83% align:start
The information about the branch
universes that comes and goes

00:34:17.791 --> 00:34:19.726 position:13% line:83% align:start
at the quantum level within
the brain...

00:34:19.759 --> 00:34:21.394 position:5% line:89% align:start
may just be the source of things

00:34:21.428 --> 00:34:24.098 position:27% line:83% align:start
that people call
"premonition" or "precognition".

00:34:24.131 --> 00:34:25.665 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm researching
things like that.

00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:27.467 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Okabe] Wow.

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:31.438 position:10% line:83% align:start
The dreams of the universe...
Sounds very romantic to me.

00:34:31.471 --> 00:34:32.739 position:19% line:89% align:start
[in unison] "Romantic"?

00:34:32.772 --> 00:34:34.008 position:24% line:89% align:start
Problem with that?

00:34:35.508 --> 00:34:37.945 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm very impressed with you,
Miss Maki.

00:34:37.979 --> 00:34:41.148 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Okabe] A government advisory
counsel researcher at your age.

00:34:41.182 --> 00:34:42.549 position:35% line:89% align:start
Why thanks.

00:34:42.582 --> 00:34:45.186 position:13% line:83% align:start
But since I've admired the
Tower for years,

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:47.822 position:21% line:83% align:start
it's very fulfilling
work for me.

00:34:47.855 --> 00:34:50.858 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've admired it myself.
You and I have a lot in common.

00:34:50.892 --> 00:34:53.861 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Maki] Shirakawa's the one
who's truly admirable!

00:34:53.895 --> 00:34:55.997 position:27% line:83% align:start
He's the youngest
outside researcher!

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:59.901 position:16% line:83% align:start
And his enthusiasm, well,
he's just so cool!

00:34:59.934 --> 00:35:04.071 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] Uh... No, I'm not...
I'm not that cool actually.

00:35:09.476 --> 00:35:11.778 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Maki] I'd better get going now.

00:35:11.812 --> 00:35:13.647 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.883 position:33% line:83% align:start
It looks like
I ate most of them.

00:35:15.917 --> 00:35:17.517 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Okabe] That's all right.

00:35:19.186 --> 00:35:21.989 position:16% line:83% align:start
Takuya, are you going to
the city?

00:35:22.023 --> 00:35:24.091 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] Yeah,
I'm taking Maki home.

00:35:24.125 --> 00:35:25.792 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Okabe] Do you mind giving
me a lift?

00:35:25.826 --> 00:35:27.494 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Maki and worker] What?
[Takuya] Okay.

00:35:27.527 --> 00:35:28.695 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Maki and worker] What?!

00:35:40.908 --> 00:35:42.810 position:16% line:83% align:start
You can just drop me off
at the station.

00:35:42.843 --> 00:35:44.879 position:10% line:89% align:start
What? You're not going back?

00:35:44.912 --> 00:35:47.081 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll be going to Tokyo on
business tomorrow.

00:35:49.516 --> 00:35:50.617 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] Mr. Okabe...

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:52.552 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Okabe] Yeah?

00:35:52.585 --> 00:35:55.256 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] Have you thought about
what I asked you?

00:35:55.289 --> 00:35:56.790 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Okabe] What was that?

00:35:56.824 --> 00:35:58.758 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] About Uilta.

00:35:58.792 --> 00:36:01.228 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Okabe] Ah.
You're awfully persistent.

00:36:01.262 --> 00:36:03.965 position:13% line:83% align:start
It looks to me like you're
working hard at the lab.

00:36:03.998 --> 00:36:06.033 position:30% line:83% align:start
That work seems
worthwhile, right?

00:36:06.067 --> 00:36:07.902 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] That's not really
the case.

00:36:07.935 --> 00:36:10.637 position:10% line:83% align:start
I just need to settle matters
with that Tower...

00:36:14.574 --> 00:36:16.944 position:24% line:89% align:start
[beep, beep, beep]

00:36:16.978 --> 00:36:18.913 position:13% line:89% align:start
[nurse] What's the matter?

00:36:18.946 --> 00:36:22.917 position:10% line:77% align:start
Nothing. I just didn't think
you could see the Tower
from Tokyo, as well.

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:25.853 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah, there are days
like that...

00:36:25.886 --> 00:36:27.855 position:30% line:83% align:start
The air's quite
clear today, so...

00:36:27.888 --> 00:36:29.622 position:19% line:89% align:start
This way, please, Sir.

00:36:34.862 --> 00:36:36.230 position:24% line:83% align:start
[doctor] That's the
progression of her condition

00:36:36.263 --> 00:36:38.265 position:33% line:83% align:start
since she was
admitted to this hospital.

00:36:38.299 --> 00:36:41.168 position:7% line:83% align:start
The onset was in the summer of
her third year in middle school.

00:36:41.202 --> 00:36:42.602 position:21% line:89% align:start
The cause is unknown.

00:36:42.635 --> 00:36:44.872 position:10% line:83% align:start
The hours of sleep gradually
got longer,

00:36:44.905 --> 00:36:46.307 position:7% line:89% align:start
and she was able to stay awake

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:49.176 position:16% line:83% align:start
for only limited periods
of time.

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:52.880 position:16% line:83% align:start
This girl has been asleep
for three years.

00:36:52.913 --> 00:36:55.149 position:7% line:83% align:start
You're telling me she's having
some sort of dream?

00:36:55.182 --> 00:36:57.584 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's what the recorded
brain waves show.

00:36:57.617 --> 00:36:59.619 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hmm. The DNA test?

00:36:59.652 --> 00:37:01.255 position:33% line:89% align:start
On page six.

00:37:02.857 --> 00:37:04.225 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yes, I see...

00:37:04.258 --> 00:37:08.129 position:21% line:83% align:start
She's from a divided
family? Fine.

00:37:08.162 --> 00:37:09.629 position:10% line:89% align:start
This is the request document

00:37:09.662 --> 00:37:11.598 position:10% line:83% align:start
from the Ministry of Health,
Labor and Welfare.

00:37:11.631 --> 00:37:13.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Tomizawa] As soon as the
transfer date is decided,

00:37:13.134 --> 00:37:15.702 position:24% line:83% align:start
you'll receive the
official documents.

00:37:15.735 --> 00:37:17.570 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's this letter?

00:37:17.604 --> 00:37:18.906 position:13% line:83% align:start
[doctor] Something that the
patient was writing...

00:37:18.939 --> 00:37:21.075 position:19% line:83% align:start
at the beginning of her
hospitalization.

00:37:21.108 --> 00:37:22.243 position:27% line:89% align:start
Did you read it?

00:37:22.276 --> 00:37:23.543 position:33% line:89% align:start
[doctor] No.

00:37:24.211 --> 00:37:25.712 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Tomizawa] Emishi Plant...

00:37:50.404 --> 00:37:53.808 position:35% line:77% align:start
[Tomizawa]
Thus, by detecting the disparity
of the multiple universes...

00:37:53.841 --> 00:37:56.377 position:19% line:83% align:start
that keep branching off
in its path,

00:37:56.410 --> 00:38:00.247 position:10% line:83% align:start
a highly accurate prediction
of the future becomes possible.

00:38:00.281 --> 00:38:02.049 position:5% line:83% align:start
The ultimate goal of my research
lab lies here as well.

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:05.953 position:16% line:83% align:start
This isn't a conventional
theoretical model,

00:38:05.986 --> 00:38:07.955 position:19% line:89% align:start
nor probability theory,

00:38:07.988 --> 00:38:12.193 position:16% line:77% align:start
but entirely information
that is based on the results
of the actual future.

00:38:12.226 --> 00:38:14.095 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Tomizawa] So the impact
of this matter,

00:38:14.128 --> 00:38:17.630 position:16% line:83% align:start
on key decision making in
politics and military affairs,

00:38:17.664 --> 00:38:19.366 position:10% line:89% align:start
will likely be incalculable.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:22.403 position:7% line:83% align:start
I believe you can all draw your
own conclusions.

00:38:22.436 --> 00:38:25.239 position:7% line:83% align:start
But on the other hand, we have
no other choice but to think...

00:38:25.272 --> 00:38:26.841 position:13% line:89% align:start
that the applied technology

00:38:26.874 --> 00:38:29.709 position:19% line:83% align:start
of the Quantum-Gravity
theory on the Union side...

00:38:29.742 --> 00:38:32.847 position:7% line:83% align:start
has reached such a high level,
that we're no match for them.

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.816 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's generally assumed that the
construction of the Ezo Tower

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:37.650 position:21% line:89% align:start
was started in 1974,

00:38:37.684 --> 00:38:39.053 position:7% line:89% align:start
after the North-South division,

00:38:39.086 --> 00:38:42.156 position:16% line:83% align:start
with operations beginning
around 1996.

00:38:45.893 --> 00:38:48.095 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Tomizawa] Ironic that
mainlander, Ekusun Tsukinoe,

00:38:48.129 --> 00:38:49.864 position:27% line:83% align:start
played a central
role in the design.

00:38:49.897 --> 00:38:51.866 position:24% line:83% align:start
Next, I'll explain
new experiments

00:38:51.899 --> 00:38:53.766 position:10% line:89% align:start
for parallel world detection.

00:38:56.103 --> 00:38:58.873 position:13% line:77% align:start
[Tomizawa] I thought there
was someone in the audience
with a bad attitude.

00:38:58.906 --> 00:39:00.407 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Okabe] I was listening
to your talk,

00:39:00.441 --> 00:39:02.076 position:7% line:89% align:start
and from what I can understand,

00:39:02.109 --> 00:39:05.146 position:5% line:83% align:start
you want to look into the dreams
God's having, is that right?

00:39:05.179 --> 00:39:07.780 position:27% line:83% align:start
Do a little dream
reading, as it were.

00:39:07.815 --> 00:39:09.850 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Tomizawa] Well, that's more
or less correct.

00:39:09.884 --> 00:39:10.985 position:30% line:89% align:start
You interested?

00:39:11.018 --> 00:39:13.120 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Okabe] I've prepared a bid.

00:39:13.154 --> 00:39:15.389 position:10% line:83% align:start
You know, it's been a while.
How about going out tonight?

00:39:19.894 --> 00:39:23.297 position:35% line:77% align:start
[Tomizawa]
Shirakawa's excellent.
He's certainly got aptitude.

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:25.232 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Okabe] You're glad you talked
to him, aren't you?

00:39:25.266 --> 00:39:29.436 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Tomizawa] Yeah. But since when
did you start student placement?

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:33.040 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Okabe] Well, you could say
they're special to me.

00:39:33.073 --> 00:39:35.176 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Tomizawa] <i>They're</i> special?

00:39:35.209 --> 00:39:38.312 position:10% line:77% align:start
Yeah. There's another student
of mine that I'm getting
kind of worried about.

00:39:38.345 --> 00:39:41.482 position:24% line:83% align:start
Can't seem to make
contact with him.

00:39:41.515 --> 00:39:44.051 position:13% line:83% align:start
The two of them were making
an airplane together.

00:39:44.084 --> 00:39:46.020 position:7% line:89% align:start
That brings back some memories!

00:39:46.053 --> 00:39:48.189 position:7% line:89% align:start
Is that why you came to Tokyo?

00:39:48.222 --> 00:39:50.024 position:16% line:83% align:start
I thought it was another
matter entirely.

00:39:50.057 --> 00:39:52.159 position:16% line:89% align:start
What'd you think it was?

00:39:52.193 --> 00:39:53.360 position:27% line:89% align:start
The Uilta matter.

00:39:54.794 --> 00:39:57.865 position:24% line:83% align:start
Actually, it is the
main reason.

00:39:57.898 --> 00:40:01.035 position:13% line:83% align:start
Going to be able to get our
hands on a PL outer-shell bomb.

00:40:01.068 --> 00:40:02.870 position:13% line:89% align:start
Don't ask me where though.

00:40:02.903 --> 00:40:05.272 position:10% line:83% align:start
I have an idea, more or less,
without asking.

00:40:05.306 --> 00:40:09.776 position:7% line:83% align:start
And so what? Want to ask me if
they work against the Tower?

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:11.512 position:41% line:89% align:start
Maybe.

00:40:11.545 --> 00:40:13.746 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I think they'll work.

00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:17.151 position:16% line:83% align:start
The exterior of the Tower
will likely vaporize.

00:40:17.184 --> 00:40:20.454 position:10% line:77% align:start
And there's reason to believe
the interior is made up of
nanonet ribbons.

00:40:20.487 --> 00:40:23.924 position:24% line:83% align:start
It'll probably fall
down in flames.

00:40:23.958 --> 00:40:27.895 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yup... PL outer-shell bombs
may be most suitable.

00:40:27.928 --> 00:40:29.129 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:40:32.566 --> 00:40:36.804 position:16% line:77% align:start
But such action by Uilta
may raise the chance
of starting a war...

00:40:36.837 --> 00:40:38.205 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Tomizawa] Why don't you
pass on it?

00:40:38.239 --> 00:40:39.807 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Okabe] That's why we'll do it.

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.208 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Tomizawa] Is this
matter decided?

00:40:41.242 --> 00:40:43.377 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Okabe] More or less.

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:47.448 position:19% line:77% align:start
Since there are so many
higher-ups who are anxious
to start a war.

00:40:47.481 --> 00:40:51.452 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Tomizawa] Wasn't your ideology
North-South unification?

00:40:51.485 --> 00:40:53.786 position:27% line:89% align:start
And it still is.

00:40:53.821 --> 00:40:56.490 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Tomizawa] I do feel it's too
valuable to be destroyed.

00:40:56.523 --> 00:40:57.591 position:19% line:89% align:start
From the Alliance side,

00:40:57.625 --> 00:41:00.527 position:7% line:83% align:start
it's fruit of technologies are
almost unbelievable.

00:41:00.561 --> 00:41:03.330 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's just standing there
at most with no real effect.

00:41:03.364 --> 00:41:04.498 position:38% line:89% align:start
So uh...

00:41:04.531 --> 00:41:06.133 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't hide it from me.

00:41:06.166 --> 00:41:08.402 position:13% line:83% align:start
That Tower's not operating
right now,

00:41:08.435 --> 00:41:12.940 position:16% line:77% align:start
but there's a possibility
it's a weapon that'll reverse
the surrounding space...

00:41:12.973 --> 00:41:14.341 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Tomizawa] So you knew?

00:41:14.375 --> 00:41:15.476 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Okabe] Yeah.

00:41:15.509 --> 00:41:17.444 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Tomizawa] I like that view,
though... to be honest.

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:22.916 position:13% line:83% align:start
Every so often, I run into
romantic guys just like you.

00:41:25.185 --> 00:41:27.921 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Tomizawa] Oka-chan, can I ask
you a question?

00:41:27.955 --> 00:41:29.056 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Okabe] Sure.

00:41:29.089 --> 00:41:30.291 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Tomizawa] A while back,

00:41:30.324 --> 00:41:33.027 position:7% line:83% align:start
a person who may be related to
the secret of that Tower...

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:34.161 position:30% line:89% align:start
was discovered.

00:41:34.194 --> 00:41:35.296 position:41% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:41:35.329 --> 00:41:38.032 position:27% line:83% align:start
A girl, actually.
Still in her teens.

00:41:38.065 --> 00:41:39.066 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Okabe] I see.

[Arisaka] The operational level

has suddenly been raised!

00:56:20.381 --> 00:56:23.918 position:33% line:77% align:start
The limits of

[Tomizawa] This is...

00:56:37.064 --> 00:56:39.200 position:13% line:83% align:start
Is this going to overwrite

Speed of disparate matter

00:57:06.627 --> 00:57:09.230 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Tomizawa] As we thought, the
subject's sleep was the key...

00:57:09.263 --> 00:57:11.865 position:16% line:83% align:start
that was restraining the
Tower's activity.

00:57:11.899 --> 00:57:15.469 position:7% line:83% align:start
The information of the parallel
world that the Tower captures...

00:57:15.502 --> 00:57:18.472 position:10% line:83% align:start
is flowing into the subject's
dream for now,

00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:08.022 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] A tall tower?

00:58:08.055 --> 00:58:10.124 position:19% line:89% align:start
Is it the Union Tower?

00:58:10.157 --> 00:58:14.361 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Sayuri] No. It has a more
crooked and mysterious shape.

00:58:15.262 --> 00:58:17.865 position:10% line:89% align:start
Inside the tower where I am,

00:58:17.898 --> 00:58:20.134 position:7% line:83% align:start
there are many others just like
it, standing all around.

In the whole area... I know this
for some reason...

00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:30.577 position:19% line:83% align:start
but each one is a whole

00:58:30.611 --> 00:58:34.114 position:13% line:83% align:start
A dream that this universe

And I can't get out and I
feel so lonely...

00:58:36.583 --> 00:58:39.987 position:16% line:83% align:start
and then when I feel like
my mind will disappear...

00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:42.389 position:19% line:83% align:start
I see a white airplane
in the sky.

00:58:45.059 --> 00:58:46.393 position:13% line:89% align:start

Maki told you.

Want to see her?

01:00:05.272 --> 01:00:08.342 position:13% line:83% align:start
We're speculating that the
reason why she keeps sleeping...

01:00:08.375 --> 01:00:10.210 position:5% line:89% align:start
is because her brain cannot bare

01:00:10.244 --> 01:00:12.246 position:7% line:83% align:start
the information of the parallel
worlds...

01:00:12.279 --> 01:00:14.648 position:10% line:89% align:start
that flows in from the Tower.

01:00:14.681 --> 01:00:15.817 position:19% line:89% align:start

I think the world will be
swallowed up in an instant...

01:00:18.585 --> 01:00:22.956 position:7% line:83% align:start
by the parallel worlds with the
Tower at the center of it all.

01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:25.592 position:13% line:83% align:start
Frankly, we don't even know
how to wake her up.

01:00:27.227 --> 01:00:29.062 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Tomizawa] With the war
starting soon,

01:00:29.096 --> 01:00:32.199 position:19% line:77% align:start
it's been decided that
she'll be transferred
to the NSA headquarters,

01:00:32.232 --> 01:00:34.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
in the home country,
within a few days.

01:00:36.036 --> 01:00:39.406 position:13% line:83% align:start
To the Alliance that falls
far behind in this field,

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.442 position:16% line:89% align:start
she is a valuable sample.

01:00:45.145 --> 01:00:48.449 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] Why does it have
to be Sayuri?

01:00:48.482 --> 01:00:50.651 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Tomizawa] Although there are
more matters that we don't know

01:00:50.684 --> 01:00:52.052 position:16% line:89% align:start
than matters that we do,

01:00:52.085 --> 01:00:54.154 position:30% line:83% align:start
I doubt this is
purely coincidence.

01:00:54.188 --> 01:00:56.223 position:27% line:83% align:start
Ekusun Tsukinoe,
the designer of the Tower,

01:00:56.256 --> 01:00:57.458 position:24% line:89% align:start
is her grandfather.

01:01:02.496 --> 01:01:05.199 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Okabe] As you've heard, the
Tower is clearly a weapon.

01:01:05.766 --> 01:01:06.868 position:19% line:89% align:start
For the past 25 years,

01:01:06.901 --> 01:01:09.603 position:10% line:83% align:start
the Tower had become part of
the everyday scenery...

01:01:09.636 --> 01:01:12.172 position:21% line:83% align:start
and it symbolized all
sorts of things.

01:01:12.206 --> 01:01:16.210 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nation. War. Race.
Despair. Admiration.

01:01:16.243 --> 01:01:18.612 position:19% line:83% align:start
Each generation looked
at it differently...

01:01:18.645 --> 01:01:20.013 position:30% line:89% align:start
But regardless,

01:01:20.047 --> 01:01:24.051 position:16% line:77% align:start
it seems everyone saw it
as a symbol of something
beyond their reach.

01:01:24.084 --> 01:01:25.652 position:5% line:89% align:start
Something that can't be changed.

01:01:26.787 --> 01:01:28.755 position:19% line:89% align:start
And as long as they do,

01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:31.258 position:24% line:83% align:start
this world probably
won't change.

01:01:33.126 --> 01:01:34.561 position:24% line:89% align:start
In just three days,

01:01:34.595 --> 01:01:38.765 position:19% line:77% align:start
the American government
will make a declaration of war
to the Union.

01:01:38.799 --> 01:01:43.270 position:24% line:77% align:start
Taking advantage of
the confusion caused by
the start of the war,

01:01:43.303 --> 01:01:46.273 position:16% line:83% align:start
we'll carry out terrorist
bombings on the Tower.

01:01:46.306 --> 01:01:49.776 position:41% line:77% align:start
[Okabe]
We'll invade Ezo airspace
with an unmanned Predator.

01:01:49.811 --> 01:01:53.146 position:10% line:83% align:start
Use a Seeker missile carrying
a PL outer-shell bomb.

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:56.717 position:7% line:83% align:start
The Uilta Liberation Front will
be disbanded on the same day.

01:01:56.750 --> 01:02:00.254 position:16% line:83% align:start
And today, we close this
factory down as well.

01:02:00.287 --> 01:02:01.722 position:38% line:89% align:start
[ringing]

01:02:03.524 --> 01:02:05.225 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] Okay.

01:02:05.259 --> 01:02:06.760 position:30% line:89% align:start
Okay, I got it.

01:02:06.793 --> 01:02:08.362 position:19% line:89% align:start
See you tomorrow, then.

01:02:20.207 --> 01:02:21.375 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey.

01:02:21.408 --> 01:02:23.710 position:16% line:89% align:start
Three years, huh Takuya?

01:02:27.214 --> 01:02:28.482 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] When did you get here?

01:02:28.515 --> 01:02:29.683 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] The day
before yesterday.

01:02:29.716 --> 01:02:32.085 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm sleeping in the
old station right now.

01:02:32.119 --> 01:02:33.253 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Takuya]
The one they closed down?

01:02:33.287 --> 01:02:34.388 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Hiroki] Yeah.

01:02:34.421 --> 01:02:37.157 position:21% line:83% align:start
Takuya, what happened
to your arm?

01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:39.626 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] Oh. It's nothing.

01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:42.162 position:27% line:83% align:start
What do you mean,
"it's nothing"?

01:02:42.195 --> 01:02:43.597 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] I'll tell you
about it later.

01:02:45.833 --> 01:02:48.435 position:7% line:83% align:start
I wonder if it's closed today.
[meow]

01:02:49.469 --> 01:02:51.171 position:21% line:89% align:start
Chobi! How you doing?

01:02:51.204 --> 01:02:52.739 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's been a while, hasn't it?

01:02:56.310 --> 01:03:00.714 position:30% line:89% align:start
[jets overhead]

01:03:17.364 --> 01:03:19.232 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] Fly the <i>Bella Ciela?</i>

01:03:21.335 --> 01:03:22.736 position:21% line:89% align:start
With Sayuri on board?

01:03:22.769 --> 01:03:24.738 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Hiroki] Yeah.

01:03:24.771 --> 01:03:28.275 position:13% line:83% align:start
Another day or so and I'll
be finished assembling it.

01:03:28.308 --> 01:03:31.645 position:16% line:83% align:start
What's left would be the
control software problem.

01:03:31.678 --> 01:03:33.680 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] Hold on.
Did you hear what I said?

01:03:33.714 --> 01:03:35.850 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sayuri keeps sleeping
and the Tower is-

01:03:35.883 --> 01:03:39.219 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] The Tower is the target
of the terrorist attack, right?

01:03:39.252 --> 01:03:41.288 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's why I need your
help, Takuya!

01:03:42.522 --> 01:03:45.292 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] I told you that
I'd been thinking...

01:03:45.325 --> 01:03:48.762 position:7% line:83% align:start
If I fly to the Tower with her,
I think she'll wake up.

01:03:50.564 --> 01:03:51.765 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] What are you
talking about?

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.735 position:21% line:83% align:start
Did you come back for
such a thing?

01:03:56.603 --> 01:03:58.906 position:27% line:89% align:start
"Such a thing"?!

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:00.808 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] We made a
promise, remember?

01:04:03.811 --> 01:04:06.647 position:10% line:89% align:start
I have dreams about Sayuri...

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:10.651 position:7% line:89% align:start
So many times... repeatedly...

01:04:10.684 --> 01:04:12.920 position:38% line:77% align:start
[Hiroki]
She was alone in a place
where there was no one around,

01:04:12.954 --> 01:04:15.522 position:10% line:83% align:start
and she told me she couldn't
remember anything.

01:04:16.824 --> 01:04:19.493 position:7% line:89% align:start
But she remembers that promise.

01:04:19.526 --> 01:04:21.495 position:7% line:89% align:start
We promised again in the dream,

01:04:21.528 --> 01:04:24.564 position:16% line:83% align:start
that I'd really take her
to the Tower this time.

01:04:24.598 --> 01:04:27.634 position:13% line:83% align:start
And I-I can't believe it's
just a dream.

01:04:31.839 --> 01:04:34.441 position:24% line:83% align:start
You come back after
three years...

01:04:34.474 --> 01:04:35.542 position:7% line:89% align:start
I wondered what it was about...

01:04:36.911 --> 01:04:38.712 position:16% line:89% align:start
And it was about a dream?

01:04:40.647 --> 01:04:42.850 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] I can't even stand
to look at you.

01:04:46.319 --> 01:04:48.321 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't have time for
this kid stuff.

01:04:50.424 --> 01:04:51.725 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] You're just obsessed.

01:04:53.527 --> 01:04:54.829 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'll help you forget.

01:04:56.998 --> 01:04:58.298 position:38% line:89% align:start
Stop it!

01:04:58.331 --> 01:04:59.599 position:41% line:89% align:start
[bang]

01:05:25.492 --> 01:05:26.693 position:41% line:89% align:start
Takuya!

01:05:28.361 --> 01:05:30.464 position:30% line:89% align:start
Save Sayuri...

01:05:30.497 --> 01:05:31.833 position:24% line:89% align:start
or save the world?

01:05:52.385 --> 01:05:57.557 position:33% line:89% align:start
[school bell]

01:06:13.373 --> 01:06:15.542 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] I, uh,
forgot something.

01:06:16.743 --> 01:06:17.879 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Sayuri] I see.

01:06:24.051 --> 01:06:25.820 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] Aren't you going
home, Sayuri?

01:06:26.553 --> 01:06:28.588 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, yes. I am.

01:06:32.659 --> 01:06:34.694 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Sayuri] Hiroki...

01:06:34.728 --> 01:06:36.998 position:10% line:89% align:start
What happened to your cheek?

01:06:37.031 --> 01:06:39.299 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] Oh, I had a little
fight with Takuya.

01:06:40.835 --> 01:06:42.402 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Sayuri] Are you okay?

01:06:42.435 --> 01:06:43.938 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Hiroki] I'm okay, yeah.

01:06:43.971 --> 01:06:46.473 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm sure we'll make up soon.
Probably.

01:06:48.075 --> 01:06:49.476 position:10% line:89% align:start
Listen, have a good evening.

01:06:49.509 --> 01:06:50.878 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Sayuri] Hiroki!

01:06:50.912 --> 01:06:53.047 position:7% line:89% align:start
A-Are you going to the station?

01:07:02.689 --> 01:07:04.959 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Sayuri] <i>I always have</i>
 <i>a premonition...</i>

01:07:04.992 --> 01:07:07.327 position:30% line:83% align:start

01:07:19.706 --> 01:07:21.441 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] <i>But I think that</i>
 <i>at that time,</i>

01:07:21.474 --> 01:07:26.013 position:10% line:77% align:start
 <i>it looked to me as if Sayuri</i>

01:07:28.149 --> 01:07:31.384 position:35% line:89% align:start
 <i>Ah. I see.</i>

01:07:31.418 --> 01:07:33.955 position:16% line:83% align:start

01:07:34.754 --> 01:07:36.824 position:33% line:89% align:start
Something...

01:07:36.858 --> 01:07:38.592 position:19% line:89% align:start
Something important...

01:07:51.038 --> 01:07:53.607 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Hiroki] Hello! Is anyone home?

01:08:02.616 --> 01:08:04.185 position:35% line:89% align:start
Mr. Okabe!

01:08:04.218 --> 01:08:05.685 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's me, Hiroki.

01:08:05.719 --> 01:08:07.121 position:35% line:89% align:start
Mr. Okabe!

01:08:09.522 --> 01:08:11.458 position:7% line:89% align:start
But the contact information...

01:08:28.876 --> 01:08:30.644 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Okabe] Just as I thought.

01:08:30.677 --> 01:08:33.047 position:10% line:89% align:start
My, Hiroki. How you've grown.

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:34.514 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okabe?

01:08:34.547 --> 01:08:35.649 position:33% line:89% align:start
What are you-

01:08:35.682 --> 01:08:37.484 position:19% line:89% align:start
I heard it from Takuya.

01:08:37.517 --> 01:08:40.922 position:24% line:83% align:start
Let's see just how
determined you are.

01:08:40.955 --> 01:08:42.823 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Okabe] <i>You</i> guys destroy
that Tower.

01:08:44.058 --> 01:08:46.626 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Maki] Are the terrorist bombing
rumors true?

01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:48.863 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] I don't know.

01:08:48.896 --> 01:08:50.898 position:13% line:83% align:start
But the start of the war is
probably coming soon...

01:08:50.932 --> 01:08:53.600 position:24% line:89% align:start
and once it starts,

01:08:53.633 --> 01:08:57.805 position:10% line:83% align:start
research on the Tower may be
the last thing we can think of.

01:08:57.838 --> 01:08:59.173 position:33% line:83% align:start
I think that
what Tsukinoe's doing

01:08:59.206 --> 01:09:00.808 position:16% line:83% align:start
and what terrorists like
Uilta are doing...

01:09:00.841 --> 01:09:02.944 position:19% line:89% align:start
may be the same thing.

01:09:02.977 --> 01:09:05.112 position:30% line:83% align:start
Protesting the
North-South division.

01:09:07.148 --> 01:09:10.151 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're so mysterious,
aren't you, Shirakawa?

01:09:10.184 --> 01:09:12.186 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Maki] I feel like you have
a lot of secrets.

01:09:12.219 --> 01:09:14.021 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] No, not at all...

01:09:14.055 --> 01:09:15.990 position:13% line:89% align:start
Sorry. I'll make some tea.

01:09:16.023 --> 01:09:19.193 position:21% line:83% align:start
And then, I'll treat
your wound, okay?

01:09:24.597 --> 01:09:27.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
You seem to get a lot
of wounds these days.

01:09:27.801 --> 01:09:30.037 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sorry.

01:09:30.071 --> 01:09:32.006 position:16% line:83% align:start
Do you have some troubles
or something?

01:09:32.039 --> 01:09:34.141 position:33% line:89% align:start
No, I'm okay.

01:09:35.109 --> 01:09:36.210 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] Really...

01:09:41.715 --> 01:09:44.584 position:19% line:89% align:start
He was my best friend.

01:09:44.617 --> 01:09:45.518 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Maki] What?

01:09:45.552 --> 01:09:49.090 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] We admired the
very same things.

01:09:49.123 --> 01:09:50.724 position:13% line:89% align:start
And we had the same goals.

01:09:50.757 --> 01:09:52.792 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Maki] Yeah.

01:09:52.827 --> 01:09:55.296 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] But we both went
to different places.

01:09:55.329 --> 01:09:56.964 position:30% line:89% align:start
How can I say?

01:09:56.998 --> 01:10:00.600 position:19% line:83% align:start
I didn't know in which
direction I should go...

01:10:00.633 --> 01:10:03.070 position:10% line:83% align:start
even though the energies and
urges I couldn't understand

01:10:03.104 --> 01:10:04.238 position:27% line:89% align:start
welled up inside.

01:10:05.638 --> 01:10:07.274 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Maki] Yeah.

01:10:07.308 --> 01:10:11.678 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] So I was relieved
to join the work at this lab,

01:10:13.314 --> 01:10:17.818 position:7% line:83% align:start
I felt like I'd found something
I should be doing.

01:10:17.852 --> 01:10:20.154 position:19% line:89% align:start
I was glad to meet you.

01:10:24.291 --> 01:10:25.658 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] I don't want to
involve you.

01:10:26.894 --> 01:10:28.062 position:7% line:89% align:start
There's something I have to do.

01:10:42.243 --> 01:10:44.812 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] When this...
when this is all over,

01:10:46.679 --> 01:10:47.680 position:24% line:89% align:start
I would like to...

01:10:48.816 --> 01:10:50.184 position:7% line:89% align:start
I would like to see you again.

01:10:52.153 --> 01:10:53.220 position:35% line:89% align:start
Shirakawa!

01:11:22.749 --> 01:11:24.085 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] Sayuri...

01:11:24.118 --> 01:11:26.053 position:7% line:89% align:start
Let's go to the promised place.

01:11:26.087 --> 01:11:27.221 position:21% line:89% align:start
This time, for sure.

01:11:35.329 --> 01:11:37.630 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Tomizawa] What's going on,
Oka-chan?

01:11:37.664 --> 01:11:40.101 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're going to use kids
for something like that?

01:11:40.134 --> 01:11:42.036 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Okabe] They're the ones who
wanted to do it.

01:11:42.069 --> 01:11:44.171 position:10% line:83% align:start
Besides, the surrounding area
of the Tower

01:11:44.205 --> 01:11:48.042 position:7% line:83% align:start
has been swallowed by what you
call parallel worlds, right?

01:11:48.075 --> 01:11:49.176 position:30% line:83% align:start
No one's going
to die there.

01:11:49.210 --> 01:11:50.743 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Tomizawa] That's no
reason for-

01:11:50.777 --> 01:11:53.080 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Okabe] Calm down, Tomizawa.

01:11:53.114 --> 01:11:55.816 position:24% line:83% align:start
Anyway, by the time
they get back,

01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:57.750 position:13% line:89% align:start
they won't be kids anymore.

01:11:59.386 --> 01:12:02.289 position:24% line:83% align:start
Shall I guess what
you're thinking right now?

01:12:05.792 --> 01:12:08.129 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh boy, oh boy...

01:12:08.162 --> 01:12:09.396 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Okabe] Well then,
I'm hanging up.

01:12:12.166 --> 01:12:14.301 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's finally coming to a climax.

01:12:16.736 --> 01:12:19.706 position:19% line:83% align:start
Is Sayuri really going
to wake up with that?

01:12:19.739 --> 01:12:23.144 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] I'm convinced she
will too, now. For some reason.

01:12:23.177 --> 01:12:26.881 position:10% line:83% align:start
The promise from that day is
probably her tie to reality.

01:12:26.914 --> 01:12:31.452 position:7% line:83% align:start
Even now, she's waiting for the
 <i>Bella Ciela</i> in her dream.

01:12:31.485 --> 01:12:34.088 position:7% line:83% align:start
I feel that Hiroki and I always
knew this somehow.

01:12:38.259 --> 01:12:40.227 position:24% line:83% align:start
The <i>Bella Ciela</i> is
a two-seater,

01:12:40.261 --> 01:12:42.897 position:13% line:83% align:start
and I really couldn't pilot
her with this arm.

01:12:42.930 --> 01:12:46.066 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] I'll stay behind and
watch what happens to the Tower.

01:12:48.302 --> 01:12:51.839 position:10% line:83% align:start
I thought it was cold. Looks
like it's snowing again.

01:12:51.872 --> 01:12:53.040 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll be going now.

01:12:53.073 --> 01:12:55.176 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah. Look at that.

01:12:55.209 --> 01:12:57.411 position:24% line:83% align:start
You two are working
together again.

01:12:57.444 --> 01:12:59.113 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now be good to each other!

01:13:06.753 --> 01:13:08.788 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] Which one is it...
Is this it?

01:13:19.967 --> 01:13:22.102 position:30% line:89% align:start
[door opening]

01:13:45.392 --> 01:13:47.861 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] Did you hear it
from Mr. Okabe?

01:13:47.895 --> 01:13:49.263 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Hiroki] Yeah.

01:13:55.936 --> 01:13:57.770 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Hiroki] Takuya.

01:13:57.805 --> 01:14:01.108 position:7% line:83% align:start
Which version of BIOS you think
I should use?

01:14:01.141 --> 01:14:03.244 position:19% line:83% align:start
You changed the ladder,
didn't you?

01:14:03.277 --> 01:14:04.411 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't have the one after that.

01:14:07.982 --> 01:14:09.917 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's in this.

01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:12.119 position:24% line:83% align:start
It also has one for
the Seeker missile.

01:14:12.152 --> 01:14:14.255 position:10% line:89% align:start
What else do you have to do?

01:14:14.288 --> 01:14:16.390 position:13% line:83% align:start
I still have to do a little
bit of wiring.

01:14:16.423 --> 01:14:18.192 position:19% line:83% align:start
On the superconducting
motor, I think.

01:14:19.426 --> 01:14:22.062 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] Five more hours until
war declaration.

01:14:22.096 --> 01:14:24.865 position:13% line:77% align:start
Flying is going to take you
right into the middle of
the fighting.

01:14:24.898 --> 01:14:28.135 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll do the software so
you can finish up the wiring.

01:14:28.168 --> 01:14:29.470 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Hiroki] Yeah.

01:14:29.503 --> 01:14:32.273 position:13% line:83% align:start
Takuya, what's up with that
error message?!

01:14:32.306 --> 01:14:33.474 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] What?

01:14:33.507 --> 01:14:35.109 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] The one with
the Version Check.

01:14:35.142 --> 01:14:37.411 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] Version Check?

01:14:37.444 --> 01:14:41.115 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, isn't that the part you
put together three years ago?

01:14:41.148 --> 01:14:43.350 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Hiroki] Oh, really?

01:14:43.384 --> 01:14:45.152 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] You haven't changed...

01:14:45.185 --> 01:14:46.453 position:41% line:89% align:start
Idiot.

01:15:10.210 --> 01:15:11.912 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] Hiroki!
Take a look at this.

01:15:12.413 --> 01:15:13.981 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Hiroki] What?

01:15:14.014 --> 01:15:15.416 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] The forecast of
the battle conditions

01:15:15.449 --> 01:15:17.217 position:5% line:89% align:start
off the coast of Tsugaru is out.

01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:21.255 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's just what we thought.

01:15:24.558 --> 01:15:27.428 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, the frontline will be
around the 42nd latitude.

01:15:27.461 --> 01:15:28.395 position:27% line:89% align:start
The inland area,

01:15:28.429 --> 01:15:31.265 position:13% line:83% align:start
especially around the Tower
is almost empty.

01:15:31.298 --> 01:15:33.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
The erosion of land is
pretty advanced.

01:15:33.467 --> 01:15:34.601 position:44% line:89% align:start
Well?

01:15:34.635 --> 01:15:36.570 position:10% line:83% align:start
We slip through by flying in
low with the jet engine...

01:15:37.938 --> 01:15:39.440 position:7% line:89% align:start
until we go through the strait.

01:15:39.473 --> 01:15:41.208 position:5% line:89% align:start
After passing the 42nd latitude,

01:15:41.241 --> 01:15:43.277 position:7% line:89% align:start
when we increase the altitude.

01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:45.112 position:27% line:89% align:start
How's that sound?

01:15:45.145 --> 01:15:49.950 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah... seems that's the
only way.

01:15:49.983 --> 01:15:51.318 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Takuya]
When you get to the Tower,

01:15:51.352 --> 01:15:54.054 position:13% line:83% align:start
coinciding with when Sayuri
wakes up,

01:15:54.088 --> 01:15:55.889 position:7% line:83% align:start
the disparate matter conversion
on the ground

01:15:55.923 --> 01:15:57.124 position:24% line:89% align:start
should start again.

01:15:57.157 --> 01:16:00.227 position:24% line:83% align:start
When that happens,
break away immediately.

01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:02.496 position:5% line:83% align:start
Once you're more than 10 km away
from the Tower,

01:16:02.529 --> 01:16:04.231 position:16% line:89% align:start
fire the Seeker missile.

01:16:04.264 --> 01:16:06.500 position:19% line:83% align:start
I programmed it to take
over from there.

01:16:06.533 --> 01:16:09.136 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] Yeah. It should
be okay, right?

01:16:09.169 --> 01:16:12.272 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah. Two hours left until
the start of the war.

01:16:13.374 --> 01:16:15.042 position:19% line:83% align:start
We finished it earlier
than we thought.

01:16:15.075 --> 01:16:16.210 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mmhmm.

01:16:18.112 --> 01:16:19.213 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Takuya] Hiroki...

01:16:19.246 --> 01:16:20.647 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Hiroki] Huh?

01:16:20.681 --> 01:16:23.884 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] Is it possible that
you could play the violin?

01:16:27.421 --> 01:16:29.390 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Takuya] You know, you're
awfully single-minded.

01:16:29.423 --> 01:16:32.292 position:19% line:83% align:start
Kind of like an idiot,
aren't you?

01:16:32.326 --> 01:16:34.328 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's none of you business,
you jerk!

01:16:34.361 --> 01:16:36.096 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're the one who asked
me to play!

01:16:37.264 --> 01:16:38.665 position:19% line:89% align:start
Look this way, please.

01:16:38.699 --> 01:16:40.167 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just shut up, will ya?!

01:16:40.968 --> 01:16:42.403 position:21% line:89% align:start
Be quiet and listen!

01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:28.449 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Sayuri] <i>I can tell</i>
 <i>my body's trembling</i>

[Arisaka] The Tower's operating
levels are rising again!

01:18:02.516 --> 01:18:05.619 position:13% line:83% align:start
Erosion area of the branch
universes is expanding!

01:18:05.652 --> 01:18:08.422 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Maki] Its radius is
currently about 36km...

01:18:08.455 --> 01:18:10.057 position:24% line:83% align:start
in the middle of a
slow expansion.

01:18:11.225 --> 01:18:13.527 position:21% line:83% align:start
Is it reacting to the
sign of her waking up?

01:18:15.062 --> 01:18:17.364 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're sure it's okay, Oka-chan?

01:18:17.798 --> 01:18:19.233 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Maki] Professor!

01:18:19.266 --> 01:18:21.268 position:10% line:83% align:start
Sir, a declaration of war has
just been made!

01:18:23.070 --> 01:18:25.339 position:13% line:83% align:start
The first encounter is the
Tsugaru coast.

01:19:51.224 --> 01:19:53.260 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gunfire]

01:20:39.807 --> 01:20:40.808 position:38% line:89% align:start
The land!

01:22:09.362 --> 01:22:11.999 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Sayuri.

01:22:12.033 --> 01:22:13.868 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] It's the
promised place.

01:22:15.736 --> 01:22:17.671 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Sayuri] <i>Those wings...</i>

 <i>Oh, I see.</i>

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:35.522 position:27% line:83% align:start
 <i>I know now what</i>
 <i>I'm going to lose.</i>

01:22:36.490 --> 01:22:38.025 position:35% line:89% align:start
 <i>Oh God...</i>

01:22:38.059 --> 01:22:40.494 position:30% line:89% align:start
Please, God...

01:22:40.527 --> 01:22:41.996 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sayuri and Hiroki] Please, God.

01:22:42.029 --> 01:22:44.431 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] Please wake Sayuri
from her sleep.

01:22:44.464 --> 01:22:48.468 position:30% line:89% align:start
Please. Please.

01:22:48.502 --> 01:22:53.440 position:38% line:77% align:start
[Sayuri]
Please, even if it's just for
a moment after waking up,

01:22:53.473 --> 01:22:55.943 position:7% line:83% align:start
please don't erase the feeling
that I have right now.

01:22:59.046 --> 01:23:00.447 position:19% line:89% align:start
I have to tell Hiroki,

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:04.919 position:13% line:77% align:start
how special the connection
between our hearts was
in my dream and...

01:23:04.952 --> 01:23:07.521 position:19% line:83% align:start
how much I was longing
for Hiroki

01:23:07.554 --> 01:23:10.724 position:30% line:83% align:start
and how deeply
he longed for me...

01:23:10.757 --> 01:23:13.961 position:13% line:83% align:start
in a world where there was
no one around.

01:23:15.428 --> 01:23:16.964 position:38% line:89% align:start
Sayuri...

01:23:18.365 --> 01:23:19.566 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Sayuri] Please.

01:23:19.599 --> 01:23:23.004 position:13% line:83% align:start
I have to tell him how much
I've loved him all this time.

01:23:23.037 --> 01:23:24.906 position:16% line:83% align:start
If I could... If I could
tell him that much,

01:23:24.939 --> 01:23:27.374 position:13% line:89% align:start
I don't need anything else.

01:23:27.407 --> 01:23:30.677 position:21% line:83% align:start
Please, even for just
a second...

01:23:30.710 --> 01:23:32.546 position:16% line:89% align:start
this feeling that I have!

01:23:34.447 --> 01:23:35.482 position:41% line:89% align:start
Please!

01:23:59.439 --> 01:24:00.607 position:38% line:89% align:start
Sayuri...

01:24:06.113 --> 01:24:07.347 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hiroki.

01:24:11.618 --> 01:24:14.454 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Maki] Disparate matter
conversion is rapidly expanding!

01:24:14.487 --> 01:24:15.990 position:16% line:89% align:start
Ezo's being swallowed in!

01:24:35.142 --> 01:24:36.509 position:38% line:89% align:start
Sayuri...

01:24:41.514 --> 01:24:42.850 position:38% line:89% align:start
I have...

01:24:45.086 --> 01:24:48.755 position:10% line:83% align:start
I have to tell you something
very important.

01:24:48.788 --> 01:24:50.057 position:27% line:89% align:start
But it's gone...

01:24:52.126 --> 01:24:53.526 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Sayuri] It's gone!

01:25:06.173 --> 01:25:07.842 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] Everything will
be all right.

01:25:07.875 --> 01:25:09.676 position:16% line:89% align:start
Because you're awake now.

01:25:10.677 --> 01:25:12.646 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're back now. Back.

01:25:19.253 --> 01:25:21.554 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Hiroki] Welcome back, Sayuri.

01:26:44.905 --> 01:26:47.640 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Hiroki] <i>We've lost our</i>
 <i>promised place in this world.</i>

01:26:48.608 --> 01:26:50.044 position:33% line:89% align:start
 <i>But even so,</i>

01:26:50.077 --> 01:26:52.046 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>we'll start living now.</i>
