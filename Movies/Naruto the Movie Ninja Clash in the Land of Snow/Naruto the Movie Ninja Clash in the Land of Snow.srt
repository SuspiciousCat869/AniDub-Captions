Fall to your knees

PRINCESS: I will never give up.

25
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,539
As long as I live, I
will gather my strength

the whole thing!

I wish we could’ve
stayed a little longer.

71
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:12,738
I could have watched
that handsome Omiji

who played Tsukekuro
all day long.

compare to you, Sasuke.

got your taste in men, Sakura.

I mean, where’s my
Princess Gale, you know?

83
00:04:42,557 --> 00:04:49,397
If I could fight for a girl
like that, I’d be on cloud nine.

‐Whatever.

we had to go see this
movie before he’d

I’m your biggest fan!

Can I have your autograph?

173
00:09:43,774 --> 00:09:44,684
‐Yeah, me, too!

174
00:09:44,775 --> 00:09:45,065
‐Here, please!

175
00:09:45,192 --> 00:09:46,702
orget it, guys.

176
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,909
I don’t do autographs.

‐Please.

‐Come on.

‐Hey, what about me?

180
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:52,828
Can I get one?

‐Please!

‐You’re a movie star!

Aw, come on!

184
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:56,998

‐I mean, come on!

What’s so special about
getting my autograph, huh?

189
00:10:03,544 --> 00:10:05,454
You’re just going to
shove it in some drawer

190
00:10:05,546 --> 00:10:06,256
and forget about it.

191

l it’s good for
is collecting dust.

192
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,848
They’re just a waste of time!

193
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:13,467
They’re useless!

194
00:10:13,554 --> 00:10:16,264
What a joke!

195
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,230
‐Ugh, that was so rude.

196
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,150
Not like she is in
the movies, is she?

197
00:10:21,228 --> 00:10:25,358
‐Her success went
right to her head.

198
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:29,031
KAKASHI: Our mission is to guard
Yukie Fujikaze, the actress

199
00:10:29,111 --> 00:10:31,871
best known for her
role as Princess Gale.

200
00:10:31,947 --> 00:10:34,027
‐Guard?

201
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:38,246
‐Well, maybe not guard
her so much as escort her.

202
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,620
‐The next Princess Gale
movie is the first one

203
00:10:40,748 --> 00:10:42,538
that we’re shooting abroad.

204
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,835
And, uh, I don’t need to
tell you our leading lady

205
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,589
is a bit of a diva.

206
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,172
‐Sorry, uh, I do apologize.

207
00:10:48,255 --> 00:10:51,545
‐I’ll tell you, these
Leaf Ninja are impressive.

208
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:55,754
Uh, they took care of those
stuntmen‐turned‐bodyguards

209
00:10:55,846 --> 00:10:58,016
we hired was child’s play.

210
00:10:58,098 --> 00:10:59,978
And those are some big fellows.

211
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,440
‐Oh, well, uh, thank you.

212
00:11:08,984 --> 00:11:11,234
‐Oh, wow!

213
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,660
Look at those cliffs.

214
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:17,450
MAN: Uh, that’s the Rainbow
Glacier in the Land of Snow.

215
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,746
‐Hey, you played
the part of Buriken!

216
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:22,248
‐That’s where we’re all going to
shoot the scenes for the film’s

217
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:23,921
big climactic ending.

218
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:24,789
‐You’re Hidero!

219
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,037
You play Shishimaru!

220
00:11:26,126 --> 00:11:28,086
‐Land of Snow?

221
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,130
Long way to go to shoot
some scene for a movie.

222
00:11:30,214 --> 00:11:32,924
‐Yukie Fujikaze’s manager,
Sandayu, over here

223
00:11:33,008 --> 00:11:35,298
recommended it.

224
00:11:35,386 --> 00:11:37,716
Apparently, he tells
us this Rainbow Glacier

225
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:40,135
turns seven different colors
during the springtime.

226
00:11:40,265 --> 00:11:43,305
‐No, that’s just an old legend.

227
00:11:43,394 --> 00:11:46,814
The truth is, there isn’t any
spring in the Land of Snow.

228
00:11:46,897 --> 00:11:47,317
‐What?

229
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:48,359
Not ever?

230
00:11:48,482 --> 00:11:50,492
‐Does that mean it’s
winter all year long?

231
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:51,109
‐Mm‐hm.

232
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:52,693
You got it.

233
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,450
‐Kakashi, wasn’t it?

234
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,990
From what I hear, this
won’t be your first time

235
00:11:57,074 --> 00:11:57,574
in the Land of Snow.

236
00:11:57,658 --> 00:11:59,828
Is that true?

237
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,330
‐That was a long time ago.

238
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,495
MAN: They say that it’s
a very poor nation, too.

239
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:06,334
‐Huh!

240
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,338
[gasps]

00:12:10,295 --> 00:12:13,965
‐You‐‐ you, Tsukekuro,
Omiji, you were great!

242
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:16,009
‐Actually, the story
is their former lord

243
00:12:16,093 --> 00:12:18,013
had a thing for gadgets.

244
00:12:18,095 --> 00:12:19,515
The guy squandered
everything the clan

245
00:12:19,596 --> 00:12:22,516
had on mountains of
useless doodads and gizmos.

246
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:25,649
‐Yeah, well, I just hope
they’ve got central heating.

247
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:27,188
I’m not really all that
cut out for the cold.

248
00:12:27,312 --> 00:12:30,192
‐Maybe you should run
for the hills, too.

249
00:12:30,274 --> 00:12:31,144
Just like Yukie.

250
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:33,023
‐Oh, hey, come on, you guys.

251
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,030
That’s not even funny.

[men laughing]

253
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:40,829
‐So does that mean, Yukie‐‐ I
mean, she not always like this,

254
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:42,039
is she?

00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:43,119
‐Hm.

256
00:12:43,203 --> 00:12:45,073
‐Kind of, yeah.

257
00:12:45,205 --> 00:12:49,875
Poor Yukie, huh, she wouldn’t
even know the meaning of words

258
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,210
like "dreams" or "aspirations."

259
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:56,047
DIRECTOR: But she’s never
been one to neglect her work.

260
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,045
I don’t know anything
about her personal life,

261
00:12:58,135 --> 00:12:59,715
and I don’t need to.

262
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:02,805
As long as she’s giving her
all when the camera’s rolling,

263
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,270
I won’t have any complaints.

264
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:07,101
Say what you will, that
woman is a born actress.

DIRECTOR: He’s right.

267
00:13:10,314 --> 00:13:12,684
And anyway, she only
started running from the set

268
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:14,895
after she heard we were
going to the Land of Snow.

What the heck was that?

got to be kidding.

you, Princess Gale!

‐I told you, kid.

You think I don’t know that!

Do you really think you could
trample all over a kid’s dreams

like this?

I can’t think of a worse
job than being an actor.

Only the lowest of the low would

It happens all the time, OK?

I mean, lead actresses
change from sequel to sequel.

Come on, directors change
every five minutes.

‐Fubuki, Mizore, I’ll
leave the princess to you.

502
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:20,665
‐Very well, then.

503
00:25:24,714 --> 00:25:26,674
‐It’s been a long time, Kakashi.

504
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,810
I hope you’re not planning
to run like the last time.

505
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,969
‐Nadare Roga.

506
00:25:45,193 --> 00:25:46,823
‐I don’t know what’s
in the script,

507
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:49,195
but I’ve always wanted
to be in the movies!

508
00:25:49,322 --> 00:25:50,872
Don’t you worry, Princess.

509

‐Hurry!

514
00:26:23,857 --> 00:26:26,527
Back to the ship, everyone!

‐Princess!

517
00:26:31,698 --> 00:26:32,948
‐Sandayu, what are you‐‐

518
00:26:33,032 --> 00:26:34,122
‐Ice Prison!

00:26:51,634 --> 00:26:52,044

‐Keep that camera rolling
even if it kills you!

‐Sensei!

526
00:27:12,196 --> 00:27:14,116
There’s something strange
about their armor!

527
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:14,910
‐Yeah, I know.

528
00:27:14,991 --> 00:27:17,291
Just be careful.

529
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:20,670
It’s Chakra Armor created by the
ninja here in the Land of Snow.

530
00:27:20,747 --> 00:27:22,537
‐Chakra Armor?

531
00:27:22,624 --> 00:27:25,624
‐But it’s definitely a lot
stronger than it used to be.

532
00:27:25,752 --> 00:27:28,132
NADARE: So you remember.

533
00:27:28,254 --> 00:27:31,214
The armor increases the
chakra within the body,

534
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:34,389
strengthening a handful
of the more useful jutsu.

535
00:27:34,469 --> 00:27:38,139
A chakra barrier gathers
around us as well,

536
00:27:38,264 --> 00:27:41,764
able to deflect the
chakra of our adversaries.

537
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:47,443
As a result, ninjutsu and
genjutsu are rendered useless.

538

You little brat!

MIZORE (VOICEOVER):
What is this chakra?

545
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:34,198
‐Ugh!

00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:54,718
‐Yukie, hurry!

547
00:28:54,841 --> 00:28:56,261
Get to the ship already!

‐Father!

550
00:29:08,229 --> 00:29:09,899
‐What are you doing?

551
00:29:10,023 --> 00:29:11,363
Get out of here!

552
00:29:11,441 --> 00:29:13,861
‐Princess, please, we
must get to the ship.

553
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,195
‐No.

554
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:16,238
‐You’ve got to go now!

555
00:29:16,362 --> 00:29:17,412
Your life is‐‐

556
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,530
‐I don’t care if I die!

557
00:29:19,615 --> 00:29:23,035
I won’t‐‐ I won’t come
back to the Land of Snow!

558
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:25,831
‐We don’t have
time for this, OK?

559
00:29:25,913 --> 00:29:26,073
Ugh!

560
00:29:26,205 --> 00:29:26,825
Aagh!

‐Huh?

00:29:43,389 --> 00:29:45,059
‐Don’t be in such a hurry.

565
00:29:45,141 --> 00:29:47,061
We’re not finished yet.

Now, it’s my turn.

out of here!

00:30:11,918 --> 00:30:13,588
‐Still copying my moves, huh?

573
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:16,049
You’re not going to
settle this by doing that.

574
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,300
‐Settle the fight?

575
00:30:18,424 --> 00:30:21,134
That’s not really what I was
aiming for at the moment.

576
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:21,890
‐What?

577

00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:09,560
It’s been a long time.

KAKASHI: You’ve known all
along, Sandayu, haven’t you?

585
00:31:28,327 --> 00:31:30,617
SANDAYU: Yes.

586
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:32,495
KAKASHI: Didn’t you
ever consider the risks

587
00:31:32,582 --> 00:31:37,172
of what might happen if she
came back to the Land of Snow?

588
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,335
SANDAYU: You’re
right, of course.

589
00:31:38,462 --> 00:31:40,512
But this was the
only way I could

590
00:31:40,631 --> 00:31:43,841
think to get the
princess to return home.

‐[laughs]

Come on, Sandayu.

593
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:48,681
You don’t have to
keep calling her that.

594
00:31:48,764 --> 00:31:50,224
I mean, she’s only royalty
on the big screen, right?

595
00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:53,479
It’s not like she’s
really a princess.

596
00:31:53,561 --> 00:31:56,111
SANDAYU: Actually, she is.

597
00:31:56,189 --> 00:31:57,149
‐Huh?

598
00:31:57,231 --> 00:31:59,781
‐Yukie Fujikaze
is only an alias.

599
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:03,359
We’re guarding Princess Koyuki
Kazahana, the rightful heir

00:32:03,446 --> 00:32:05,156
to the Land of Snow’s throne.

[both gasp]

602
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,655
‐I first met her
a long time ago.

603
00:32:09,744 --> 00:32:12,784
I was her aide when she was
still just a little girl.

604
00:32:12,872 --> 00:32:15,172
I don’t blame her
for not remembering.

605
00:32:15,249 --> 00:32:16,839
It was years ago.

606
00:32:16,918 --> 00:32:21,048
‐So does that mean you are also
from the Land of Snow, Sandayu?

607
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,380
‐That’s right.

608
00:32:22,465 --> 00:32:25,215
I served the princess’s
father, the former leader

609
00:32:25,301 --> 00:32:27,351
of the clan, Lord
Sosetsu Kazahana.

610
00:32:29,764 --> 00:32:32,384
The Land of Snow is
not a large nation,

611
00:32:32,516 --> 00:32:37,646
but‐‐ but served as
a haven of peace.

612
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:41,400
Lord Sosetsu, he absolutely
adored the princess.

613
00:32:41,484 --> 00:32:43,524
Ahh, those were idyllic times.

614
00:32:48,658 --> 00:32:53,368
But 10 years ago, on that cursed
day, Lord Sosetsu’s younger

615
00:32:53,454 --> 00:32:55,244
brother Doto hired a
group of Snow ninja

616
00:32:55,331 --> 00:32:58,541
and instigated a revolt.

617
00:32:58,626 --> 00:33:00,086
It was a coup d’etat.

618
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:07,429
The magnificent Kazahana
Castle burned to the ground.

619
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:10,600
And I feared the princess
had perished as well.

‐Keep your face hidden.

621
00:33:16,102 --> 00:33:17,772
They could still find us!

622

SANDAYU (VOICEOVER): There was
no way we could defeat them.

623
00:33:24,527 --> 00:33:27,407
We had to keep running.

624
00:33:27,488 --> 00:33:30,238
We had to get away.

00:33:30,324 --> 00:33:33,114
‐Father!

626
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:36,034
‐The day that I discovered
our beloved princess was still

627
00:33:36,122 --> 00:33:39,792
alive, I was practically
beside myself with joy.

‐[grunts]

‐You mustn’t say such
things, Princess.

635
00:33:57,518 --> 00:33:58,808
We feared the worst.

636
00:33:58,894 --> 00:34:01,354
You can’t imagine how
frantic we all were.

637
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,360
We never stopped
praying for your life.

638
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:06,951
PRINCESS: I’m alive,
but my heart is dead.

‐[gasps]

640

‐After that day, any tears
I had left all dried up.

641
00:34:17,705 --> 00:34:21,955
‐And that’s how I came to be
the manager for Yukie Fujikaze.

642
00:34:22,043 --> 00:34:24,513
I have bided my time
waiting for the day when

643
00:34:24,628 --> 00:34:27,338
I could escort her
back to Land of Snow.

644
00:34:27,423 --> 00:34:28,223
‐Uh!

645
00:34:28,341 --> 00:34:29,721
So what are you saying then?

646
00:34:29,842 --> 00:34:32,352
That all of this time
you’ve just been using us?

647
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,850
‐Uh, I apologize
for deceiving you.

648
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:37,602
But it was for the sake of
the Land of Snow’s people.

649
00:34:40,436 --> 00:34:45,436
Princess Koyuki, confront Doto
and assume your rightful place

650
00:34:45,524 --> 00:34:49,524
as the leader of our land!

651
00:34:49,653 --> 00:34:52,403
I will sacrifice my
life without hesitation

652
00:34:52,531 --> 00:34:53,911
in order to protect you.

653
00:34:54,033 --> 00:34:55,163
I beg you!

654
00:34:55,242 --> 00:34:57,042
Take up arms and
lead your people!

655
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,164
YUKIE: I don’t think so.

656
00:35:05,252 --> 00:35:06,212
‐Huh?

657
00:35:06,295 --> 00:35:06,955
‐You’ve got to be kidding.

658
00:35:07,046 --> 00:35:10,886
‐But what about
what your people?

659
00:35:10,966 --> 00:35:12,466
‐I couldn’t care
less about them.

660
00:35:12,551 --> 00:35:14,471
Just forget it!

661
00:35:14,553 --> 00:35:15,383
‐But, Princess.

662

Quit being so heartless!

Can’t you see this poor man

Now that Doto is on her trail,
running isn’t an option.

Once we’ve finished

we’ll pass through

Tell me, little princess, do you
have the hex crystal with you?

‐Yes.

‐Good.

908
00:50:39,019 --> 00:50:42,359
It is the sole remaining
link to the Kazahana Clan

and the key to
opening its treasure.

‐When I wrested this land
from your father’s hands,

912
00:50:54,701 --> 00:50:58,541
the Kazahana Clan’s
resources were all but gone.

913
00:50:58,663 --> 00:51:02,203
I knew Sosetsu must have
hidden his riches somewhere.

914
00:51:02,334 --> 00:51:08,834
I searched for a long time,
and finally, I found it.

915
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:12,385
It is hidden deep within
the Rainbow Glacier.

916
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:14,390
There’s a keyhole
there which can only

917
00:51:14,512 --> 00:51:18,562
be opened by the hex crystal.

918
00:51:18,683 --> 00:51:21,973
Once I have possession
over the Kazahana fortune,

919
00:51:22,062 --> 00:51:25,482
our country can attain
military superiority

‐We’re cleansing
him of his chakra.

943
00:52:35,802 --> 00:52:37,972
That device will
absorb any that’s

944

stored in his body and bind
it within a powerful barrier.

01:19:08,351 --> 01:19:14,151
I‐‐ I will never give up,
will never give up, yeah.

1320
01:19:14,232 --> 01:19:17,702
Like a hurricane,
like a hurricane.

1321
01:19:17,819 --> 01:19:20,029
Like jerks.

1322
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:23,695
Hurricane, like a hurricane.

1323
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:25,035
Lightning strikes.

1324
01:19:25,118 --> 01:19:26,698
In like a hurricane.

1325
01:19:30,874 --> 01:19:32,204
In like a hurricane.

1326
01:19:42,886 --> 01:19:44,216
In like a hurricane.

1327
01:20:23,593 --> 01:20:29,423
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh.

1328
01:20:29,557 --> 01:20:34,107
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh.

1329
01:20:34,187 --> 01:20:36,147
Oh, whoa, oh‐‐

1330
01:20:36,272 --> 01:20:39,442
YUKIE: That
generator wasn’t even

1331
01:20:39,567 --> 01:20:41,737
fully developed in the end.

1332
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:44,780
SAKURA: I guess it will be
back to winter soon, huh?

1333
01:20:44,864 --> 01:20:45,864
YUKIE: Not really.

1334
01:20:45,949 --> 01:20:48,159
If we take what we know
and continue researching,

1335
01:20:48,284 --> 01:20:50,994
before you know it,
the Land of Snow

1336
01:20:51,121 --> 01:20:53,881
will be called the
Land of Spring.

1337
01:20:53,957 --> 01:20:56,877
‐Yeah, but it’s kind of a shame.

1338
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,130
You’re such a big star.

1339
01:20:58,253 --> 01:21:00,553
Are you really going
to retire from acting?

1340
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:01,090
YUKIE: Who said I was retiring?

1341
01:21:01,172 --> 01:21:03,642
BOTH: Huh?

1342
01:21:03,716 --> 01:21:06,216
‐Ruling over the Land
of Snow and acting?

1343
01:21:06,302 --> 01:21:08,642
I think I can handle both.

1344
01:21:08,763 --> 01:21:12,053
I mean, I’d have to be out
of my mind to give it up now.

1345
01:21:12,142 --> 01:21:14,102
‐Uh, that’s great.

1346
01:21:14,185 --> 01:21:15,435
‐Well, I’ll be seeing you.

1347
01:21:19,816 --> 01:21:20,146
‐That’s her!

1348
01:21:20,233 --> 01:21:20,863
‐There she is!

1349
01:21:20,984 --> 01:21:23,904
‐Princess, sign here!

1350
01:21:23,987 --> 01:21:24,527
‐Sure!

1351
01:21:24,654 --> 01:21:25,274
‐Can I have your autograph?

1352
01:21:25,363 --> 01:21:26,193
‐Would you please sign‐‐

1353
01:21:26,322 --> 01:21:27,242
KAKASHI: That is great.

1354
01:21:27,323 --> 01:21:31,783
She’s perfect.

1355
01:21:31,870 --> 01:21:33,670
‐Aaagh!

1356
01:21:33,746 --> 01:21:34,706
I’m so stupid.

1357
01:21:34,831 --> 01:21:36,381
I should have
gotten an autograph!

1358
01:21:36,499 --> 01:21:39,129
‐Don’t worry, I took care of it.

1359
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:39,590
TEAM: Huh?

1360
01:21:42,338 --> 01:21:43,008
‐Whoa.

1361
01:21:49,304 --> 01:21:52,014
Aagh!

1362
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:54,390
Oh, man, look at me.

1363
01:21:54,517 --> 01:21:55,937
Couldn’t you, at
least, have used

1364
01:21:56,019 --> 01:21:58,859
a better picture or something?

1365
01:21:58,938 --> 01:21:59,358
Haay.

1366
01:22:05,862 --> 01:22:07,372
DIRECTOR: And cut!

1367
01:22:07,447 --> 01:22:08,367
That’s a wrap.

1368
01:22:08,448 --> 01:22:09,908
ASSISTANT: Good stuff people!

1369
01:22:10,033 --> 01:22:11,203
Thanks a million.

1370
01:22:11,326 --> 01:22:12,366
Hey, let’s do lunch, seriously.

1371
01:22:12,452 --> 01:22:14,212
Nice working with you, buddy.

1372
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:15,369
DIRECTOR: Isn’t that wonderful?
