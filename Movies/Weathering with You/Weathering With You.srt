1
00:00:54,126 --> 00:00:55,142
This story

2
00:00:55,517 --> 00:00:57,683
is one that only she and I can tell.

3
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,331
It is the story of the secret of this world.

4
00:01:34,818 --> 00:01:36,137
It was just there,

5
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:38,365
like a pool of light.

6
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,112
Without even thinking, she ran out of the hospital.

7
00:02:35,766 --> 00:02:37,838
Praying with all her heart,

8
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:40,952
she crossed the shrine gate.

9
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:04,620
Are those fish?

10
00:03:17,524 --> 00:03:19,080
Even now, I wonder

11
00:03:19,538 --> 00:03:21,645
if everything I saw that day

12
00:03:22,307 --> 00:03:23,950
was all just a dream.

13
00:03:25,244 --> 00:03:26,809
But I know it wasn't.

14
00:03:27,646 --> 00:03:29,486
On that summer day,

15
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,401
up in that sky,

16
00:03:32,704 --> 00:03:36,208
we changed the shape of the world.

17
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:08,385
Attention, all passengers.

18
00:04:08,474 --> 00:04:10,866
We will be expecting very heavy rain shortly.

19
00:04:11,437 --> 00:04:13,128
It's gonna rain again?

20
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:14,868
I thought it was finally clearing up.

21
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,086
There was a typhoon on the island, too.

22
00:04:19,111 --> 00:04:20,287
It was still fun.

23
00:04:20,312 --> 00:04:21,431
Excuse me.

24
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:22,024
Sorry.

25
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:23,443
We may as well get lunch.

26
00:04:23,468 --> 00:04:24,800
We ask that all passengers

27
00:04:24,825 --> 00:04:27,254
who are out on the deck to please go back...

28
00:04:42,397 --> 00:04:43,318
Whoa.

29
00:04:48,843 --> 00:04:50,263
So cool.

30
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:06,256
Huh?

31
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,772
Thank you.

32
00:05:31,673 --> 00:05:34,326
Yeah. That was a pretty intense storm, huh?

33
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:43,011
This is shockingly delicious.

34
00:05:43,288 --> 00:05:45,190
You, uh, want to try, little man?

35
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:47,383
Nope. I'm not that hungry.

36
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,877
Last chance. 'Cause I'll just dig in.

37
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,084
Thanks for treating, by the way.

38
00:05:51,109 --> 00:05:51,952
Oh, don't mention it.

39
00:05:52,087 --> 00:05:53,945
It's the least I could do since you saved me.

40
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,026
Oh, I did, didn't I?

41
00:05:55,051 --> 00:05:56,570
It was a close one, too, huh?

42
00:05:57,928 --> 00:05:58,595
Oh.

43
00:05:59,754 --> 00:06:01,415
Hey, wait a minute.

44
00:06:01,764 --> 00:06:02,288
Huh?

45
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,043
Yeah.

46
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:06,912
This is actually the first time I've saved a guy's life.

47
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,414
Well done, me.

48
00:06:08,676 --> 00:06:09,376
Oh. Okay.

49
00:06:10,068 --> 00:06:11,258
Come to think of it,

50
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:13,887
I think I deserve a beer.

51
00:06:14,381 --> 00:06:15,867
Do you want me to buy you one?

52
00:06:17,137 --> 00:06:17,726
That's...

53
00:06:18,115 --> 00:06:19,506
so expensive.

54
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:22,944
I can't believe a grown man is mooching off of me.

55
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:26,067
Tokyo sure is scary.

56
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:45,149
Ugh. It's raining again.

57
00:06:47,772 --> 00:06:51,260
So, tell me, little man, what brings you to Tokyo?

58
00:06:51,363 --> 00:06:54,167
Oh, uh, I'm just here to visit some relatives.

59
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,725
Uh, 'cause, uh, at my school,

60
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,424
uh, s-summer break starts early.

61
00:06:57,457 --> 00:06:58,181
I see.

62
00:06:59,735 --> 00:07:02,445
Well, if you ever need help, feel free to reach out.

63
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:04,765
See you around, little man.

64
00:07:04,878 --> 00:07:06,530
In the baggage claim area.

65
00:07:06,565 --> 00:07:10,017
Again, thank you for riding the Salvia Maru,

66
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:11,305
operated by Tokai Kisen...

67
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,227
Yeah, right.

68
00:07:20,894 --> 00:07:21,696
Huh?

69
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,223
The shower's 280 for 20 minutes max.

70
00:07:25,248 --> 00:07:26,018
Here.

71
00:07:27,226 --> 00:07:28,452
That's crazy.

72
00:07:28,577 --> 00:07:29,927
It started pouring out of nowhere.

73
00:07:29,952 --> 00:07:31,603
You should know better by now.

74
00:07:31,628 --> 00:07:33,467
Not my job to clean up after you.

75
00:07:33,717 --> 00:07:34,693
I'm sorry.

76
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:38,495
Last year's record instances

77
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,498
of sudden torrential rain were exceeded this year,

78
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:43,800
with more frequent occurrences expected in July.

79
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:45,902
It is advised to take extreme caution...

80
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:46,926
Yes!

81
00:07:47,331 --> 00:07:48,784
Not just to the mountains

82
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,915
and beaches, but also throughout the city.

83
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,909
In order to prevent accidents

84
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:54,965
and potential disasters, it is imper...

85
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,125
Seriously?!

86
00:07:57,574 --> 00:07:58,758
You sure you're in college?

87
00:07:58,783 --> 00:07:59,411
Let's see your I.D.

88
00:07:59,435 --> 00:07:59,927
No I.D.?

89
00:07:59,951 --> 00:08:00,999
How we supposed to hire you?

90
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:02,597
This job some kind of joke to you?

91
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:04,351
As you can see, sudden downpour...

92
00:08:05,524 --> 00:08:06,392
Huh?

93
00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:11,396
Tokyo sure is scary.

94
00:08:20,431 --> 00:08:22,694
Can't keep spending money like this.

95
00:08:30,632 --> 00:08:32,292
You can't sit here. You'll have to move.

96
00:08:32,317 --> 00:08:33,216
Right. Sorry.

97
00:08:33,286 --> 00:08:34,328
All you can drink for 18 yen!

98
00:08:34,353 --> 00:08:36,457
Hi there, big guy. Would you like to come inside?

99
00:08:36,536 --> 00:08:37,846
Hang on, buddy. Can you spare a minute?

100
00:08:40,017 --> 00:08:42,455
Please beware of solicitors.

101
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:45,808
You are not obligated to give them any money.

102
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,707
They may or may not be telling the truth.

103
00:08:47,732 --> 00:08:48,659
Hey, hang on there.

104
00:08:49,391 --> 00:08:50,558
What are you doing out here?

105
00:08:50,802 --> 00:08:52,059
You in high school?

106
00:08:53,665 --> 00:08:54,376
Hey, wait!

107
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,483
Hey, come back here!

108
00:08:55,876 --> 00:08:56,737
What the hell?!

109
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:59,952
This has been a public service
announcement from the Shin...

110
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:17,928
Huh.

111
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,597
Tokyo sure is scary.

112
00:09:32,109 --> 00:09:33,268
You know what?

113
00:09:34,183 --> 00:09:35,011
I just...

114
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:36,566
I don't want to go home.

115
00:09:36,848 --> 00:09:37,994
Not ever.

116
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,218
Seriously?

117
00:09:42,461 --> 00:09:43,402
Who is this kid?

118
00:09:43,426 --> 00:09:44,220
He sleeping?

119
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:45,563
Out here?

120
00:09:45,587 --> 00:09:46,590
Hey, kid.

121
00:09:46,768 --> 00:09:48,236
You can't be out here.

122
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:49,205
Oh, sorry.

123
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:54,922
God, is he okay?

124
00:09:54,946 --> 00:09:56,104
Ah, he's fine.

125
00:09:56,151 --> 00:09:58,595
So, you would make way more with us.

126
00:09:58,717 --> 00:09:59,555
Pardon me.

127
00:09:59,647 --> 00:10:00,600
Gross.

128
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:22,073
It's got to be a toy.

129
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,497
Uh, s-sorry. Wh-What... what's this?

130
00:11:24,568 --> 00:11:25,947
It's for you, but don't tell.

131
00:11:25,971 --> 00:11:27,421
Uh, but wh-what for?

132
00:11:27,446 --> 00:11:30,073
Take it, unless you want to have chowder for dinner again.

133
00:11:40,872 --> 00:11:45,088
I think that was the most delicious
dinner I've had in all 16 years of my life.

134
00:11:58,352 --> 00:12:00,226
Hey, so when can I see you again?

135
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:02,466
Uh, how about the day after tomorrow?

136
00:12:02,672 --> 00:12:04,896
Great. I discovered this cute new café.

137
00:12:04,968 --> 00:12:06,158
I'll book us a table.

138
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,846
Bye, Nagi. See you then.

139
00:12:08,925 --> 00:12:10,250
See you then, Ayane.

140
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:12,689
They're in elementary school?

141
00:12:16,473 --> 00:12:17,331
Nice!

142
00:12:17,577 --> 00:12:19,189
I was hoping I'd see you.

143
00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:20,662
Hi there, Kana.

144
00:12:20,686 --> 00:12:21,604
Hello, Nagi.

145
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,359
What a player.

146
00:12:23,384 --> 00:12:24,580
Oh, did you curl it?

147
00:12:24,604 --> 00:12:25,849
Do you like it like this?

148
00:12:25,884 --> 00:12:27,572
I do. It's super cute.

149
00:12:29,637 --> 00:12:32,193
Tokyo sure is amazing.

150
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,366
This should be it.

151
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:38,762
Yeah?

152
00:12:49,472 --> 00:12:50,059
Hmm?

153
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:53,468
It's not working. Ugh.

154
00:12:58,817 --> 00:12:59,855
Excuse me.

155
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,563
I called earlier.

156
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,349
Hello? Is anybody here?

157
00:13:06,117 --> 00:13:08,118
Mr. Suga...?

158
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:14,282
Mr. Suga?

159
00:13:22,874 --> 00:13:24,867
No, I shouldn't be doing this.

160
00:13:24,892 --> 00:13:26,320
Mm. Hello.

161
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,695
I-I'm so sorry.

162
00:13:28,743 --> 00:13:30,530
Oh, you're the new assistant.

163
00:13:30,657 --> 00:13:31,961
Kei told me about you.

164
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:33,368
What? No, I haven't...

165
00:13:33,518 --> 00:13:35,370
I'm Natsumi. Welcome.

166
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:35,759
Huh?

167
00:13:35,862 --> 00:13:39,469
Finally, he's found someone to do all my grunt work.

168
00:13:43,921 --> 00:13:45,866
So, uh, kid...

169
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:47,899
Uh, yeah?

170
00:13:49,266 --> 00:13:50,661
I saw you checking out my boobs.

171
00:13:50,686 --> 00:13:51,744
No, I wasn't.

172
00:13:53,785 --> 00:13:55,406
Okay, kid, what's your name?

173
00:13:55,506 --> 00:13:56,868
Hodaka Morishima.

174
00:13:56,982 --> 00:13:59,188
Hodaka, huh? That's interesting.

175
00:13:59,387 --> 00:14:01,558
Are you one of Mr. Suga's employees?

176
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,913
Oh, so you want to know the truth about us?

177
00:14:03,948 --> 00:14:04,452
Yeah.

178
00:14:04,984 --> 00:14:05,992
Hilarious.

179
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:09,526
I know what you're thinking, and you're right.

180
00:14:11,425 --> 00:14:12,528
I don't believe it.

181
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,016
I've never met a mistress before.

182
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:17,041
Huh.

183
00:14:17,876 --> 00:14:19,918
Long time, no see, little man.

184
00:14:20,037 --> 00:14:20,996
Did you lose weight?

185
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:21,515
For me?

186
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:25,663
Let me guess... This from playing pachinko?

187
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,254
So, little man,

188
00:14:29,421 --> 00:14:31,256
you came for a job... am I right?

189
00:14:32,482 --> 00:14:34,618
This is basically what we do here.

190
00:14:34,761 --> 00:14:38,415
We write articles for time-honored, prestigious magazines.

191
00:14:41,377 --> 00:14:43,356
We're doing a piece on urban legends.

192
00:14:43,832 --> 00:14:46,654
All you got to do is talk to a
few people who have witnessed some.

193
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,748
It'll be a piece of cake.

194
00:14:47,772 --> 00:14:48,718
Huh? I'm not...

195
00:14:48,743 --> 00:14:50,260
It can be on anything.

196
00:14:50,475 --> 00:14:53,191
Doomsday predictions, abductions, you know.

197
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:55,590
Whatever you kids are into these days.

198
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:56,981
Here. I got one.

199
00:14:57,465 --> 00:15:00,436
"The girl who brings sunshine wherever she goes."

200
00:15:00,461 --> 00:15:01,316
S-Sunshine girl?

201
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,440
Bring that sunshine!

202
00:15:02,465 --> 00:15:04,607
Yeah, it's been raining so damn much this year.

203
00:15:04,632 --> 00:15:06,153
She's got to be in demand.

204
00:15:06,183 --> 00:15:06,914
Right?

205
00:15:07,363 --> 00:15:08,255
Okay.

206
00:15:08,485 --> 00:15:10,680
Come on, little man. Where's your hustle?

207
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:12,735
She's already got a thing set up.

208
00:15:12,886 --> 00:15:14,416
Tag along. Take notes.

209
00:15:14,464 --> 00:15:14,877
Huh?

210
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,402
Wait, what? Like, like, now?

211
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,067
Oh, it'll be like an audition!

212
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:18,714
A what?

213
00:15:18,991 --> 00:15:21,523
I don't think that's a good idea.

214
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:23,851
Of course.

215
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,835
Sunshine girls do exist.

216
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:26,606
I knew it!

217
00:15:27,117 --> 00:15:29,222
But rain girls exist as well.

218
00:15:29,992 --> 00:15:32,631
The former are protected by a fox spirit,

219
00:15:32,813 --> 00:15:35,308
and the latter are protected by a dragon god.

220
00:15:35,832 --> 00:15:37,004
Uh, what?

221
00:15:37,254 --> 00:15:40,472
Those who are protected by the
dragon god tend to drink a lot.

222
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,063
They yearn for water.

223
00:15:42,088 --> 00:15:45,448
They're strong-willed and competitive,
though careless and unreliable.

224
00:15:46,117 --> 00:15:47,383
That kind of sounds like me.

225
00:15:47,418 --> 00:15:49,698
Those protected by the fox spirit are hardworking

226
00:15:49,872 --> 00:15:51,455
but too timid to be leaders.

227
00:15:51,677 --> 00:15:53,561
Though many of them are quite beautiful.

228
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:54,507
That's totally me.

229
00:15:54,532 --> 00:15:59,228
The four spirits of weather are off-balance, so
more sunshine and rain girls are born these days.

230
00:15:59,263 --> 00:16:01,581
It's the homeostasis of Gaia theory.

231
00:16:01,606 --> 00:16:02,671
That's how it works.

232
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:04,570
But one must be careful.

233
00:16:05,245 --> 00:16:08,733
Whenever we mess with nature, we will always pay a price.

234
00:16:09,013 --> 00:16:11,665
And they say whoever uses too much weather power

235
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,191
will get spirited away.

236
00:16:13,271 --> 00:16:13,747
I see.

237
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:14,413
Huh?

238
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:17,703
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

239
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,068
So...

240
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,372
how did it go?

241
00:16:21,922 --> 00:16:26,863
The so-called psychic went on about mystical
stuff that came straight out of a fantasy novel.

242
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,024
Weather power making you disappear.

243
00:16:29,095 --> 00:16:30,391
Yeah, sure. Typical.

244
00:16:30,502 --> 00:16:32,798
Weather isn't controlled by girls with powers.

245
00:16:32,964 --> 00:16:35,419
It's a natural phenomenon
having to do with pressure fronts.

246
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:39,732
I know that, but we're not doing a research
paper. We're just providing some entertainment.

247
00:16:40,758 --> 00:16:42,314
Is this all you've written so far?

248
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:43,385
Damn, you're slow.

249
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:44,240
I'm sorry.

250
00:16:44,658 --> 00:16:47,631
Well, at least your writing style's not too bad.

251
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:49,602
All right, fine, you're hired.

252
00:16:49,753 --> 00:16:51,714
Huh? Hold on a minute. I wasn't looking...

253
00:16:51,739 --> 00:16:53,987
We need you on-site, so your room's included.

254
00:16:54,693 --> 00:16:55,386
Meals, too.

255
00:16:55,465 --> 00:16:56,396
Really?

256
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,865
Yes. I'll take it.

257
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,088
That's more like it.

258
00:16:59,548 --> 00:17:01,168
Now, what's your name again?

259
00:17:01,193 --> 00:17:02,217
Hilarious.

260
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:03,509
It's Hodaka.

261
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:04,238
Oh, yeah, that's right.

262
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:05,443
Dinner's ready.

263
00:17:05,945 --> 00:17:06,405
Here.

264
00:17:06,553 --> 00:17:07,302
Hmm?

265
00:17:07,804 --> 00:17:10,028
I'm underage, r-remember?

266
00:17:10,053 --> 00:17:12,858
Now, here's to our new hire,

267
00:17:13,017 --> 00:17:14,153
Hodaka.

268
00:17:14,305 --> 00:17:15,424
Bottoms up.

269
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,608
Slow down, Hodaka.

270
00:17:19,117 --> 00:17:24,296
It was the first meal I had shared
with anyone since I came to Tokyo.

271
00:17:24,518 --> 00:17:27,268
And that is how my new life began.

272
00:18:01,036 --> 00:18:04,252
The place was a small publishing
company run by Mr. Suga and Miss Natsumi...

273
00:18:04,277 --> 00:18:04,727
Hey, guys.

274
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:05,399
Good morning to you.

275
00:18:05,423 --> 00:18:07,304
Where I pretty much did all the chores.

276
00:18:07,851 --> 00:18:10,724
Starting with Mr. Suga's personal care,

277
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:14,655
to answering the phone, filing
receipts, transcribing interviews.

278
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,889
Is this seriously all you've written?

279
00:18:18,135 --> 00:18:19,375
This isn't mine.

280
00:18:19,871 --> 00:18:22,035
Sorry, but Mr. Suga's out right now.

281
00:18:23,418 --> 00:18:27,978
Sometimes, I got to ride around town with
Miss Natsumi to assist with the interviews.

282
00:18:44,983 --> 00:18:47,381
They're looking for a real-life sunshine girl.

283
00:18:47,406 --> 00:18:48,915
That's so hilarious.

284
00:18:48,971 --> 00:18:51,403
My little sister's friend's a real sunshine girl.

285
00:18:51,571 --> 00:18:53,889
People will call her up right before they go on a date.

286
00:18:53,914 --> 00:18:55,963
We really don't do those kind of interviews.

287
00:18:55,988 --> 00:18:59,937
After that, the balloon's particle
imager picked up something really strange.

288
00:19:00,245 --> 00:19:03,319
A swarm of moving objects from among the cumulonimbi.

289
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:05,926
Is this seriously all you've managed to write?

290
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,831
You should wait for these to go on sale.

291
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:09,460
Mr. Suga's out right now.

292
00:19:09,485 --> 00:19:10,664
This paragraph's crap.

293
00:19:10,688 --> 00:19:12,099
But this one here's not too bad.

294
00:19:12,124 --> 00:19:12,562
Oh.

295
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:17,320
Come on, Mr. Suga. We got to go.

296
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:18,359
Wake up.

297
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,502
My days were, well, hectic.

298
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,267
But for the first time in my life,

299
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:30,070
someone counted on me, and it was nice.

300
00:19:30,142 --> 00:19:33,740
Those rainy days in Tokyo seemed to just fly by.

301
00:19:51,035 --> 00:19:53,299
Rain. Rain.

302
00:19:53,897 --> 00:19:55,500
Rain. Rain.

303
00:19:56,994 --> 00:19:58,209
There you are.

304
00:19:58,784 --> 00:19:59,769
Hey there, Rain.

305
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:00,802
Are you good?

306
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,565
Is that so? Here.

307
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:08,509
Don't you worry your pretty head.

308
00:20:08,564 --> 00:20:10,080
I'm telling you, it's an easy job.

309
00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:10,907
We'll see.

310
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:14,617
Just try it and see how you like it.

311
00:20:14,823 --> 00:20:16,586
You'll get paid immediately after.

312
00:20:16,873 --> 00:20:18,430
Our club's right over there.

313
00:20:21,035 --> 00:20:22,170
I know her.

314
00:20:27,097 --> 00:20:30,838
You might as well give it a go
and earn some quick cash, huh?

315
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,851
It's just right through that door, okay?

316
00:20:34,876 --> 00:20:35,931
Come on, let's go.

317
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:39,417
But...

318
00:20:48,603 --> 00:20:49,485
Hey!

319
00:20:50,437 --> 00:20:51,445
Let's go!

320
00:20:53,323 --> 00:20:54,902
What? No, no, no, no.

321
00:20:54,927 --> 00:20:55,864
Where are they going?

322
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:03,599
Hey! Wait, please!

323
00:21:03,699 --> 00:21:04,760
Just keep running!

324
00:21:04,784 --> 00:21:05,772
No, wait!

325
00:21:10,238 --> 00:21:10,945
Punk!

326
00:21:14,068 --> 00:21:16,308
Hey. Where you think you're going, buddy?

327
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:18,953
What in the hell do you think you're doing?!

328
00:21:20,175 --> 00:21:21,508
You were about to force her t-to... to...

329
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:21,807
Huh?

330
00:21:21,956 --> 00:21:23,331
What are you, dumb?

331
00:21:23,895 --> 00:21:26,572
Hate to break it to you, but she and I made a deal.

332
00:21:29,058 --> 00:21:30,161
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

333
00:21:30,186 --> 00:21:32,617
Wait a second. You look familiar.

334
00:21:33,204 --> 00:21:35,341
You were squatting in front of our club.

335
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:38,266
What is this, some kind of payback?

336
00:21:38,386 --> 00:21:40,459
Please, stop hitting him.

337
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:42,687
I said stop!

338
00:21:42,711 --> 00:21:43,612
Damn you!

339
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:45,082
Get off me!

340
00:21:47,721 --> 00:21:50,389
What do you got there? A toy?

341
00:21:51,796 --> 00:21:53,838
You really are dumb.

342
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:18,809
Get up.

343
00:22:19,635 --> 00:22:20,748
Come on!

344
00:22:42,758 --> 00:22:43,321
Hey!

345
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,164
What'd you do that for?

346
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,032
Paying me back for the burger?

347
00:22:48,286 --> 00:22:48,793
Huh?

348
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:50,350
Who are you?

349
00:22:50,606 --> 00:22:51,933
And where'd you get that gun?

350
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,187
That was just...

351
00:22:53,528 --> 00:22:58,096
I-I found it. I-I thought it was a
toy, and it brought me luck, so I kept it.

352
00:22:58,416 --> 00:22:59,682
That's your reason?

353
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:01,594
How could you point it at someone?

354
00:23:01,696 --> 00:23:03,330
You could have killed him!

355
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:06,519
Seriously, who does that?

356
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:07,598
It's messed up.

357
00:23:42,202 --> 00:23:43,321
So, uh...

358
00:23:44,392 --> 00:23:45,965
I ended up getting fired.

359
00:23:46,417 --> 00:23:47,544
'Cause of me?

360
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:50,176
It didn't have anything to do with the burger.

361
00:23:50,311 --> 00:23:53,361
Since I got fired, I needed the money,

362
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:55,292
so, um...

363
00:23:55,403 --> 00:23:57,373
I'm sorry. I-I shouldn't have...

364
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,327
Hey. Does it hurt?

365
00:24:06,352 --> 00:24:07,456
No, not really.

366
00:24:08,872 --> 00:24:10,920
Let me guess... You ran away from home?

367
00:24:10,945 --> 00:24:11,532
Huh?

368
00:24:11,786 --> 00:24:13,177
It's pretty obvious.

369
00:24:13,732 --> 00:24:16,625
Too bad you can't enjoy Tokyo with all this rain.

370
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:18,403
Uh, yeah.

371
00:24:19,294 --> 00:24:20,005
Come with me.

372
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:20,413
Uh...

373
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:30,258
Whoa.

374
00:24:39,596 --> 00:24:40,357
Watch.

375
00:24:40,469 --> 00:24:41,661
It's gonna clear up.

376
00:24:41,863 --> 00:24:42,438
Huh?

377
00:24:55,349 --> 00:24:57,303
Hey. What do you mean by...

378
00:25:08,775 --> 00:25:10,016
What?

379
00:25:13,217 --> 00:25:14,536
You're a sunshine girl.

380
00:25:16,657 --> 00:25:17,987
My name's Hina.

381
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:18,986
And you?

382
00:25:19,137 --> 00:25:19,905
Hodaka.

383
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:20,424
How old?

384
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,757
Uh, 16.

385
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,259
Mm...

386
00:25:23,426 --> 00:25:24,703
You're younger than me.

387
00:25:24,727 --> 00:25:25,079
Huh?

388
00:25:25,126 --> 00:25:27,274
I'll be 18 in, uh...

389
00:25:27,768 --> 00:25:28,839
approximately a month.

390
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:30,418
You-you look younger.

391
00:25:30,568 --> 00:25:32,120
So you should treat me with respect.

392
00:25:32,596 --> 00:25:33,612
What?

393
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,630
Mm...

394
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,867
Nice to meet you, Hodaka.

395
00:26:26,716 --> 00:26:28,677
Huh?

396
00:26:33,352 --> 00:26:34,717
Mommy, I saw a fish.

397
00:26:34,788 --> 00:26:36,656
Oh, yeah? That's nice.

398
00:26:37,473 --> 00:26:39,269
You better not be making this up.

399
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:42,223
I'm dead serious. Come on, this way.

400
00:26:46,086 --> 00:26:47,555
Look. It's over there.

401
00:26:48,635 --> 00:26:49,795
What am I looking at?

402
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:50,956
It's right over there.

403
00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:52,386
Just trust me, will you?

404
00:26:57,646 --> 00:26:58,262
Huh?

405
00:26:58,337 --> 00:26:59,194
Mm.

406
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,774
What the heck is that?

407
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:24,980
And in our storm watch series,

408
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:29,480
the Kanto region is experiencing a
record-breaking amount of rainfall this summer.

409
00:27:29,513 --> 00:27:32,949
It has been raining continuously
for more than two months now.

410
00:27:33,096 --> 00:27:37,631
And our 30-day forecast predicts more
heavy rain for at least another month.

411
00:27:38,464 --> 00:27:43,312
The Meteorological Agency is calling for strict
alerts on landslides and other related disasters,

412
00:27:43,337 --> 00:27:46,888
as these are extremely unusual
weather patterns for this season.

413
00:27:46,913 --> 00:27:48,168
Is that too expensive?

414
00:27:49,271 --> 00:27:51,040
Oh, my God. Come look at this.

415
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:52,561
Huh?

416
00:27:52,586 --> 00:27:54,172
It's amazing.

417
00:27:55,229 --> 00:27:57,184
It's so weird.

418
00:28:00,298 --> 00:28:01,050
Hmm.

419
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,673
I mean, they do kind of look like fish.

420
00:28:04,223 --> 00:28:06,221
Except these things come from the sky,

421
00:28:06,653 --> 00:28:08,973
and it's not like they leave behind evidence.

422
00:28:08,998 --> 00:28:11,327
I know. They just instantly disappear. Look.

423
00:28:14,218 --> 00:28:15,107
Huh?

424
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:18,412
And remember what that guy we interviewed said?

425
00:28:18,467 --> 00:28:21,391
The sky's a more vast unknown world than even the sea.

426
00:28:22,272 --> 00:28:26,809
A cumulonimbus can hold as much water as
an entire lake. Which means it's possible

427
00:28:26,834 --> 00:28:29,367
that it could hold a whole unknown ecosystem.

428
00:28:29,725 --> 00:28:30,664
Something like...

429
00:28:30,989 --> 00:28:31,826
like these fish.

430
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:32,608
Yeah, totally.

431
00:28:32,642 --> 00:28:33,920
That's so cool!

432
00:28:34,271 --> 00:28:35,717
If we write about it...

433
00:28:36,222 --> 00:28:38,473
oh, maybe we can make good money from it.

434
00:28:38,498 --> 00:28:39,560
Huh? What's...

435
00:28:39,782 --> 00:28:40,151
Huh?

436
00:28:40,175 --> 00:28:42,615
- Oh, come on. You're starting to sound like Kei.

437
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,917
You don't want to wind up a boring grown-up.

438
00:28:44,967 --> 00:28:47,681
Careful, or that sunshine girl is gonna lose interest.

439
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,996
You two are going on a date, right?

440
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:50,536
It's not a date. I'm just confirming if...

441
00:28:50,561 --> 00:28:52,482
Well, I got a job interview, so...

442
00:28:52,594 --> 00:28:54,809
What? Don't you work here?

443
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:56,312
This is just a temporary thing.

444
00:29:01,714 --> 00:29:03,922
I told you guys, it's not a date.

445
00:29:05,503 --> 00:29:08,117
I understand how you feel, Keisuke.

446
00:29:08,189 --> 00:29:12,517
But we've finally gotten to the point
where she isn't asking about you constantly.

447
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:16,490
It would be too cruel to her to
allow you to meet with her now.

448
00:29:16,515 --> 00:29:19,094
That's not... It's well within my rights to see her.

449
00:29:19,129 --> 00:29:22,726
Well, let me ask... You still smoke, right?

450
00:29:23,068 --> 00:29:23,503
Huh?

451
00:29:23,527 --> 00:29:24,657
She has asthma.

452
00:29:25,006 --> 00:29:26,040
You know that.

453
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:28,070
Selfish, don't you think?

454
00:29:28,336 --> 00:29:30,372
Actually, not anymore.

455
00:29:30,591 --> 00:29:31,869
I've already quit.

456
00:29:31,893 --> 00:29:32,786
Perhaps.

457
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:35,788
Still, that doesn't address your lifestyle.

458
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:36,685
Huh?

459
00:29:45,386 --> 00:29:47,856
Besides, with all this rain now,

460
00:29:48,007 --> 00:29:49,683
she can't play outside.

461
00:29:49,738 --> 00:29:51,494
It would be bad for her asthma.

462
00:29:52,822 --> 00:29:54,998
I feel sorry for children nowadays.

463
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:58,723
We used to have such beautiful springs and summers.

464
00:30:11,104 --> 00:30:13,882
They can't go on living there unsupervised like that.

465
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:16,061
I completely agree.

466
00:30:22,374 --> 00:30:23,213
Wait a minute.

467
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,778
Could this possibly be...

468
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,178
the first time I'm visiting...

469
00:30:30,774 --> 00:30:32,036
a girl's home?

470
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,733
Welcome to my place.

471
00:30:35,845 --> 00:30:36,661
Was it hard to find?

472
00:30:36,686 --> 00:30:38,107
Uh, I just stopped to, uh...

473
00:30:38,132 --> 00:30:39,420
It's-it's not much. Here.

474
00:30:40,285 --> 00:30:41,515
That was very sweet of you.

475
00:30:42,088 --> 00:30:42,826
Welcome.

476
00:30:43,891 --> 00:30:44,399
Thanks.

477
00:30:44,713 --> 00:30:45,518
Sure thing.

478
00:30:49,963 --> 00:30:51,822
Hodaka, have you had lunch yet?

479
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:52,934
No, not yet.

480
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,744
But you don't have to.

481
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:55,122
Uh...

482
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:56,358
You just sit right there.

483
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,185
Hey, mind if I use these?

484
00:30:58,241 --> 00:30:59,187
Yeah. No, sure.

485
00:30:59,604 --> 00:31:00,348
Thanks.

486
00:31:13,423 --> 00:31:15,751
So, do you live all by yourself here, Hina?

487
00:31:16,029 --> 00:31:18,873
With my younger brother, due to some circumstances.

488
00:31:19,082 --> 00:31:20,547
Circumstances?

489
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:23,638
How about you? Why did you run away?

490
00:31:25,349 --> 00:31:28,144
Truth is everything was suffocating.

491
00:31:28,302 --> 00:31:30,242
That town, my parents.

492
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:32,094
I see.

493
00:31:40,348 --> 00:31:42,548
You should go back, don't you think?

494
00:31:44,145 --> 00:31:45,615
No, I don't want to.

495
00:31:46,146 --> 00:31:47,180
I see.

496
00:31:49,287 --> 00:31:51,210
Here you go. Lunch is served.

497
00:31:51,765 --> 00:31:52,543
Whoa.

498
00:31:53,355 --> 00:31:56,039
I forgot the spring onions. Where'd I put them?

499
00:31:58,146 --> 00:32:01,131
So, how do you feel now, living in Tokyo?

500
00:32:01,266 --> 00:32:02,562
Huh? Uh...

501
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:05,923
I don't feel like I'm suffocating anymore.

502
00:32:06,288 --> 00:32:08,096
Well, that's great, right?

503
00:32:08,346 --> 00:32:09,871
Bon appétit.

504
00:32:15,824 --> 00:32:17,753
Mmm!

505
00:32:19,969 --> 00:32:21,494
Wh-What's that? An earthquake?

506
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,721
No. No.

507
00:32:22,965 --> 00:32:24,736
It's just the train.

508
00:32:27,787 --> 00:32:28,676
Hodaka,

509
00:32:28,701 --> 00:32:29,695
are you serious?

510
00:32:29,925 --> 00:32:30,734
Why not?

511
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:32,698
I mean, you're a real sunshine girl, right?

512
00:32:32,723 --> 00:32:33,285
Mm-hmm.

513
00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:35,724
You can clear up the sky simply by praying.

514
00:32:35,749 --> 00:32:36,468
I guess.

515
00:32:36,492 --> 00:32:37,647
Then why not?

516
00:32:37,672 --> 00:32:39,141
You said you needed a job, right?

517
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,230
I really do. But I feel weird charging.

518
00:32:42,265 --> 00:32:47,110
Well, would you rather go back to that club? 'Cause
I don't think you're cut out for that kind of work.

519
00:32:47,817 --> 00:32:49,174
Hodaka.

520
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:50,831
What are you looking at?

521
00:32:50,855 --> 00:32:52,368
I'm not looking at anything!

522
00:32:52,542 --> 00:32:53,679
Sorry.

523
00:32:54,785 --> 00:32:57,128
Isn't 5,000 yen too expensive?

524
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,629
Okay. Uh, how about 3,000?

525
00:32:59,804 --> 00:33:03,363
Hmm, but in order to cover my living expenses...

526
00:33:04,157 --> 00:33:05,294
We should have some artwork.

527
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,669
Oh, I can draw something.

528
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:08,569
What is that?

529
00:33:09,045 --> 00:33:09,976
A hippo?

530
00:33:10,298 --> 00:33:11,159
It's a frog.

531
00:33:11,452 --> 00:33:13,168
S-Seriously?

532
00:33:13,749 --> 00:33:15,513
It's done!

533
00:33:15,767 --> 00:33:16,927
All right, I'm uploading.

534
00:33:17,014 --> 00:33:17,869
Everything look good?

535
00:33:17,893 --> 00:33:18,468
Yeah.

536
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,526
I'm home.

537
00:33:20,573 --> 00:33:23,076
Hey, the sardines were on sale, so I...

538
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:23,997
Oh.

539
00:33:25,143 --> 00:33:25,640
Who are you?

540
00:33:25,675 --> 00:33:27,892
Uh, y-you're that kid!

541
00:33:27,987 --> 00:33:29,400
From the back of the bus.

542
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:29,818
Huh?

543
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,202
You guys know each other?

544
00:33:31,434 --> 00:33:33,120
Hodaka, this is my brother Nagi.

545
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,750
Nagi, this is Hodaka,

546
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:36,953
my brand-new business partner.

547
00:33:36,977 --> 00:33:37,432
Huh?

548
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,033
Whoa! We've got a response already!

549
00:33:40,071 --> 00:33:41,868
What? You actually uploaded it?

550
00:33:41,955 --> 00:33:44,916
And they say that... that they
want good weather for a flea market.

551
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,450
Uh, and it's tomorrow!

552
00:33:46,601 --> 00:33:47,547
Hang on a minute.

553
00:33:47,674 --> 00:33:49,430
Am I really going to do this?

554
00:33:49,534 --> 00:33:50,901
And tomorrow, it looks like more rain.

555
00:33:50,926 --> 00:33:52,213
And it's gonna rain!

556
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,020
Yeah, but isn't that, like, the whole point?

557
00:33:54,044 --> 00:33:54,594
What do I do?

558
00:33:54,619 --> 00:33:55,673
Ugh, who is this guy?

559
00:33:55,697 --> 00:33:56,286
What do I do?

560
00:33:56,311 --> 00:33:57,358
It will be fine.

561
00:33:57,383 --> 00:33:58,765
I'll be there to help you.

562
00:33:58,790 --> 00:33:59,711
How?!

563
00:34:03,437 --> 00:34:05,558
Here. I brought you this.

564
00:34:11,232 --> 00:34:12,396
Thanks, but no.

565
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,184
Uh, th-that's okay.

566
00:34:14,209 --> 00:34:15,592
I have another secret weapon.

567
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,254
Sorry, but no.

568
00:34:25,883 --> 00:34:27,549
I told you, Hodaka!

569
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:30,981
Who called these guys again?

570
00:34:31,006 --> 00:34:32,944
What a bunch of weirdos.

571
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:35,748
Uh, we figured it couldn't hurt.

572
00:34:40,382 --> 00:34:42,127
Don't worry about it, kids.

573
00:34:42,152 --> 00:34:43,536
I don't think it's working.

574
00:34:43,561 --> 00:34:45,848
We can do this. We're-we're almost there.

575
00:34:45,895 --> 00:34:47,222
Do you... do you need some water, Hina?

576
00:34:47,257 --> 00:34:49,002
Uh, how about some candy?

577
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,136
Just tell 'em to go home.

578
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,089
Okay.

579
00:34:52,378 --> 00:34:52,861
The sky!

580
00:34:52,896 --> 00:34:53,872
Huh?

581
00:35:06,832 --> 00:35:09,681
It's been forever since I've seen the sun.

582
00:35:11,501 --> 00:35:12,939
It's so pretty.

583
00:35:12,964 --> 00:35:14,536
Huh. Will you look at that?

584
00:35:14,561 --> 00:35:15,737
How'd I do?

585
00:35:15,904 --> 00:35:17,460
That was truly amazing.

586
00:35:17,485 --> 00:35:18,963
You are a sunshine girl.

587
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,833
I can't believe that actually worked.

588
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:23,769
You kids did great, even if it was a coincidence.

589
00:35:23,794 --> 00:35:24,945
It wasn't!

590
00:35:25,328 --> 00:35:27,200
How does 20,000 yen sound?

591
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:28,079
It's too much.

592
00:35:28,103 --> 00:35:29,092
It's a bonus.

593
00:35:29,195 --> 00:35:30,632
For a job well done.

594
00:35:31,236 --> 00:35:32,300
Thanks again.

595
00:35:32,335 --> 00:35:35,931
People will come out now, and we'll
be... we'll be able to sell more.

596
00:35:44,624 --> 00:35:46,015
Yeah!

597
00:35:46,054 --> 00:35:46,767
That was amazing, sis!

598
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:47,111
All right!

599
00:35:47,136 --> 00:35:48,577
I can totally do this!

600
00:35:48,601 --> 00:35:49,056
Yeah!

601
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:50,844
Let's make some money off of the weather!

602
00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:51,174
Yes!

603
00:35:51,198 --> 00:35:51,838
Yeah!

604
00:36:43,092 --> 00:36:45,870
The human mind works in mysterious ways.

605
00:36:46,117 --> 00:36:50,478
Sometimes, you just need to see the sun
shining in the morning to feel energized.

606
00:36:51,137 --> 00:36:53,586
A blue sky can make you feel happy that you're alive.

607
00:36:54,095 --> 00:36:57,971
It makes you feel more in love with
that someone special by your side.

608
00:36:58,669 --> 00:37:02,224
This is a once-in-a-lifetime event,
and it better be under a blue sky.

609
00:37:02,259 --> 00:37:03,977
The meteor will be passing Earth tonight.

610
00:37:04,002 --> 00:37:06,418
He can't run well in the rain, so he's losing.

611
00:37:06,443 --> 00:37:09,536
I've been working so many hours, saving up just for today.

612
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,174
We want to play outside.

613
00:37:12,103 --> 00:37:16,053
Everyone had their own reason to want a
little sunshine in the constantly rainy Tokyo.

614
00:37:16,523 --> 00:37:20,242
Hina was only able to clear up small
areas and only for a brief amount of time.

615
00:37:20,558 --> 00:37:21,643
But it didn't matter.

616
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:24,007
The sky would always answer her prayers.

617
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:28,026
She was 100% a real-life sunshine girl!

618
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,419
It was like the whole city was
putting its best foot forward.

619
00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:49,364
It made me think...

620
00:37:50,104 --> 00:37:52,717
what a wonderful world I was born into.

621
00:37:52,915 --> 00:37:54,843
Here we go. Big smiles.

622
00:37:54,868 --> 00:37:56,845
That's it! Go, go!

623
00:37:57,435 --> 00:37:58,847
Look, there's another one.

624
00:38:03,231 --> 00:38:04,094
Thank you.

625
00:38:04,185 --> 00:38:05,160
Thanks a lot.

626
00:38:05,185 --> 00:38:06,207
Thanks.

627
00:38:06,231 --> 00:38:07,242
Thanks, guys.

628
00:38:07,337 --> 00:38:07,978
Thank you.

629
00:38:08,002 --> 00:38:09,666
Thank you so very much.

630
00:38:09,817 --> 00:38:13,352
It's amazing how a simple thing
like the weather can affect our moods.

631
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:18,246
That was when I realized for the first time just
how much the human heart is connected to the sky.

632
00:38:23,229 --> 00:38:24,398
All right, I'm off.

633
00:38:26,431 --> 00:38:27,304
Huh?

634
00:38:27,911 --> 00:38:29,012
To where?

635
00:38:29,779 --> 00:38:31,546
Ugh. Five more minutes.

636
00:38:31,581 --> 00:38:33,795
Five more minutes... That's all I'm waiting.

637
00:38:35,785 --> 00:38:37,569
Is it canceled 'cause of the rain?

638
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:39,765
When was it actually supposed to start?

639
00:38:39,825 --> 00:38:40,823
And I got all dressed up.

640
00:38:40,847 --> 00:38:42,646
There's no way it's happening.

641
00:38:43,011 --> 00:38:44,759
It's too crowded here anyway.

642
00:38:45,806 --> 00:38:48,430
I read online that your sunshine girl is amazing.

643
00:38:48,475 --> 00:38:49,784
100% success rate.

644
00:38:49,808 --> 00:38:50,939
Uh, yeah.

645
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:55,704
It's true, but d-do you really want to
rely on just that for such a huge event?

646
00:38:55,805 --> 00:38:59,796
Well, it's supposed to rain all week
long, so I can't exactly postpone it.

647
00:39:00,288 --> 00:39:01,854
I would say we're in a unique situation.

648
00:39:01,933 --> 00:39:03,275
The door is opening.

649
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,602
May as well rely on luck.

650
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:05,332
Uh...

651
00:39:31,123 --> 00:39:32,543
Huh?

652
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:56,769
The Jingu Gaien fireworks will start
promptly at 7:00 p.m. as scheduled.

653
00:40:34,794 --> 00:40:36,977
I think that I'm in love.

654
00:40:37,025 --> 00:40:37,408
Huh?

655
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,346
This job, the sunshine girl.

656
00:40:40,933 --> 00:40:43,682
It's like, for the first time in my life,

657
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,079
I've found a purpose.

658
00:40:45,518 --> 00:40:46,869
And you know what?

659
00:40:47,465 --> 00:40:50,580
That's not not not such a bad thing.

660
00:40:50,953 --> 00:40:53,221
Wait. How-how many "nots" is...

661
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,800
Is it bad or not?

662
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,078
Lighten up a little.

663
00:40:58,366 --> 00:41:01,544
And so, thank you, Hodaka.

664
00:41:07,655 --> 00:41:09,298
Weather is such a mystery.

665
00:41:10,497 --> 00:41:13,905
Seeing a beautiful sky can really make you feel things.

666
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:15,717
Just like Hina.

667
00:41:17,322 --> 00:41:19,968
She really makes me feel things.

668
00:41:37,482 --> 00:41:42,319
Yesterday's Jingu Gaien fireworks were
blessed with sudden miraculous clear skies.

669
00:41:42,565 --> 00:41:46,212
But as if to make up for it, the rain
is back again today with a vengeance.

670
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,157
The temperature in central Tokyo is now at 70 degrees,

671
00:41:49,182 --> 00:41:51,337
much lower than average for this time of year,

672
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,815
making it an unusually chilly August.

673
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:56,278
Make sure to bring a light jacket when going out.

674
00:41:56,445 --> 00:41:57,739
You're my first choice, of course.

675
00:41:57,764 --> 00:41:59,137
You're my first choice, of course.

676
00:41:59,162 --> 00:42:00,702
You're my first choice, of course.

677
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:01,952
You're my first choice, of course!

678
00:42:01,991 --> 00:42:04,559
Getting a flu shot may not be a bad idea.

679
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:09,084
In other news, the record rainfall and
low temperatures are driving food prices up.

680
00:42:09,332 --> 00:42:12,802
A head of lettuce will cost you three
times more than this time last year.

681
00:42:13,478 --> 00:42:16,004
This abnormal cold snap is affecting agriculture.

682
00:42:18,128 --> 00:42:20,098
Oh, that submission?

683
00:42:20,265 --> 00:42:21,709
Yes, we received it.

684
00:42:21,744 --> 00:42:24,468
Look, I'm sorry, but we decided to pass.

685
00:42:24,523 --> 00:42:27,685
I see. Thank you, and, uh...

686
00:42:28,121 --> 00:42:30,879
we have other pieces in the
works for, you know, next time.

687
00:42:38,752 --> 00:42:39,467
Hmm.

688
00:42:41,096 --> 00:42:42,461
Yeah, what?

689
00:42:55,945 --> 00:42:57,879
Hello. Mamiya residence.

690
00:42:57,995 --> 00:42:59,521
Hi. It's Keisuke.

691
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,945
I'm sorry to bother you, but it's regarding my visit.

692
00:43:05,073 --> 00:43:06,414
You're late again, Kei.

693
00:43:06,439 --> 00:43:07,933
And this is an important interview.

694
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:10,340
Bad mood?

695
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:12,176
Did you get rejected? Meow.

696
00:43:12,248 --> 00:43:13,261
Where's the kid?

697
00:43:15,164 --> 00:43:17,460
What do you mean, busy with his other job?

698
00:43:17,516 --> 00:43:19,144
No wonder he's been slacking.

699
00:43:19,454 --> 00:43:20,768
Just leave him alone.

700
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:22,203
It's not like we're busy.

701
00:43:22,368 --> 00:43:24,378
He took in a stray cat without asking.

702
00:43:24,521 --> 00:43:25,594
Like you took him in?

703
00:43:25,919 --> 00:43:26,577
Huh?

704
00:43:27,009 --> 00:43:28,383
I know why you did it.

705
00:43:28,408 --> 00:43:29,783
He reminds you of yourself.

706
00:43:31,562 --> 00:43:34,835
Plus, how much could it be costing
you to pay the kid each month?

707
00:43:35,782 --> 00:43:37,146
What, 30,000 yen?

708
00:43:37,171 --> 00:43:38,132
Cheapo.

709
00:43:38,244 --> 00:43:40,149
Actually, 3,000.

710
00:43:40,371 --> 00:43:43,914
Uh... what?! Are you serious?! That's slave labor!

711
00:43:43,939 --> 00:43:45,471
Is that even legal?

712
00:43:45,496 --> 00:43:48,816
You're gonna get sued by the Department
of Labor. Young people love suing.

713
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,139
You know what? Actually, I-I
think I'm gonna report you myself.

714
00:43:51,282 --> 00:43:52,927
One, he gets to live with us for free.

715
00:43:53,036 --> 00:43:55,635
Two, we pay for his food and his phone bill.

716
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:57,121
It's a sweet deal.

717
00:43:57,146 --> 00:43:58,456
Oh, God.

718
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:02,182
Well, no wonder he got another job.

719
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:05,765
That's incredible.

720
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:07,336
It really cleared up.

721
00:44:08,752 --> 00:44:10,333
You kids are amazing.

722
00:44:10,603 --> 00:44:12,358
It's a shame you're planning to quit.

723
00:44:13,408 --> 00:44:16,458
Since she was caught on camera,
we've been flooded with requests.

724
00:44:16,903 --> 00:44:18,299
We can't handle them all.

725
00:44:18,872 --> 00:44:22,726
We have one more scheduled, so we'll
do that, and then we'll stop for a while.

726
00:44:23,686 --> 00:44:24,767
And besides...

727
00:44:24,934 --> 00:44:26,785
All right, good job, sis.

728
00:44:27,968 --> 00:44:30,082
Hey, Grandma. I see you got people over.

729
00:44:30,217 --> 00:44:31,640
I wasn't expecting you.

730
00:44:31,665 --> 00:44:33,318
Just stopped by to see if you needed help.

731
00:44:33,873 --> 00:44:35,685
You've got some really young guests.

732
00:44:35,955 --> 00:44:37,274
Are you friends of Grandma's?

733
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:38,212
Hello.

734
00:44:38,815 --> 00:44:41,222
I wanted nice weather for Grandpa's Hatsubon.

735
00:44:41,247 --> 00:44:42,644
Ah. Nice.

736
00:44:42,715 --> 00:44:44,503
Well, it did stop raining.

737
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:55,301
It'd be hard for him to come back
with all the rain we've been having.

738
00:44:56,118 --> 00:44:56,783
"Come back"?

739
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:57,971
The Obon,

740
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,885
the day the dead come back from the sky to visit.

741
00:45:01,607 --> 00:45:02,704
His first Obon?

742
00:45:02,831 --> 00:45:05,216
So, then your grandpa died about a year ago?

743
00:45:05,501 --> 00:45:06,343
That's right.

744
00:45:07,267 --> 00:45:09,169
Yeah, same goes for my mom, too.

745
00:45:10,444 --> 00:45:13,732
Oh, did you lose your mother this past year, sweetie?

746
00:45:13,812 --> 00:45:14,980
Uh, yes.

747
00:45:15,472 --> 00:45:18,529
Then let's light a welcoming fire for her as well.

748
00:45:18,821 --> 00:45:20,613
I know she's watching over you.

749
00:45:21,235 --> 00:45:22,192
Thanks.

750
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,422
The spirits follow the smoke,
and that's how they come back.

751
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:32,583
Back from where?

752
00:45:32,769 --> 00:45:33,950
From Heaven.

753
00:45:34,952 --> 00:45:38,367
There's always been another world up there in the sky.

754
00:45:43,805 --> 00:45:47,847
This painting is apparently
of what the Weather Maiden saw.

755
00:45:48,347 --> 00:45:50,699
It sure is mysterious.

756
00:45:50,779 --> 00:45:53,019
I mean, there's a flying fish and a dragon?

757
00:45:53,044 --> 00:45:54,569
Absolutely stunning.

758
00:45:54,672 --> 00:45:56,157
Isn't it, though?

759
00:45:56,396 --> 00:45:58,526
So, this Weather Maiden, what is she?

760
00:45:58,637 --> 00:46:00,282
Like a shaman or what?

761
00:46:00,917 --> 00:46:01,578
Huh? What?

762
00:46:01,617 --> 00:46:02,641
Oh, he...

763
00:46:02,697 --> 00:46:04,834
Is the Weather Maiden like a shaman?

764
00:46:05,868 --> 00:46:06,931
Uh-huh.

765
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:12,214
Mending the ailing weather is
the charge of the Weather Maiden.

766
00:46:12,714 --> 00:46:14,353
So, is it like her job?

767
00:46:14,385 --> 00:46:15,393
Sounds like a scam.

768
00:46:15,448 --> 00:46:19,030
Does that mean she could fix
the abnormal weather we're having?

769
00:46:19,145 --> 00:46:22,598
Huh? There's nothing abnormal about the rain.

770
00:46:22,915 --> 00:46:25,722
The news makes a big deal about everything.

771
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,358
They always say things like "record-breaking,"

772
00:46:28,874 --> 00:46:31,170
but when did their records start?

773
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:33,029
100 years ago?

774
00:46:33,434 --> 00:46:35,827
How old do you think this painting is?

775
00:46:36,303 --> 00:46:37,950
800 years old, at least.

776
00:46:37,975 --> 00:46:39,005
800?

777
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:42,247
Hey, you're getting yourself all worked up.

778
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:44,726
Oh, oh, is he...?

779
00:46:45,138 --> 00:46:48,746
My point is the weather can suddenly change on a whim,

780
00:46:48,873 --> 00:46:51,168
regardless of our human needs.

781
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,887
So we cannot tell what is normal and what is not.

782
00:46:55,085 --> 00:46:58,995
We merely have been allowed to stay in this shifting space

783
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:02,531
between the heavens and earth, clinging for our lives,

784
00:47:02,634 --> 00:47:05,747
trying our best not to be shaken off.

785
00:47:05,921 --> 00:47:10,330
This is something we humans were
much more aware of in the past.

786
00:47:10,792 --> 00:47:16,080
However, there's a thin thread
binding us humans to the sky.

787
00:47:17,433 --> 00:47:19,713
And that is the Weather Maiden.

788
00:47:20,316 --> 00:47:24,846
A special girl with the ability
to gather the people's wishes

789
00:47:24,881 --> 00:47:27,509
and deliver them to the heavens.

790
00:47:27,917 --> 00:47:33,578
In ancient times, there was one
in every village in every country.

791
00:47:33,626 --> 00:47:35,293
Hey, Kei. Sound like anyone you know?

792
00:47:35,318 --> 00:47:39,250
You know, you don't have to
listen to everything Grandpa says.

793
00:47:39,275 --> 00:47:41,252
No one actually believes in that stuff.

794
00:47:42,278 --> 00:47:43,508
No, no, I love it.

795
00:47:43,635 --> 00:47:45,648
We're grateful for all of your insight.

796
00:47:45,797 --> 00:47:47,372
Just remember, though,

797
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,691
everything comes with a price.

798
00:47:51,332 --> 00:47:53,179
This is no exception.

799
00:47:53,377 --> 00:47:56,411
A tragic fate awaits the Weather Maiden.

800
00:47:59,312 --> 00:48:01,735
One, two, three.

801
00:48:02,108 --> 00:48:03,943
All right, it's your turn, sis.

802
00:48:05,189 --> 00:48:06,461
One, two, three.

803
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,313
Thanks for keeping Grandma company.

804
00:48:08,338 --> 00:48:09,510
- It's really kind of you.

805
00:48:09,537 --> 00:48:11,937
Oh, we're actually here 'cause she hired us.

806
00:48:11,961 --> 00:48:13,462
You have to. Come on.

807
00:48:13,747 --> 00:48:15,503
Well, they're having fun.

808
00:48:16,313 --> 00:48:17,593
How old are you guys, anyway?

809
00:48:17,751 --> 00:48:20,483
Oh. I'm 16, but she's actual...

810
00:48:22,122 --> 00:48:24,703
She mentioned that she was turning 18 next week.

811
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,482
18, huh?

812
00:48:26,586 --> 00:48:28,017
Have you thought about what to get her?

813
00:48:29,263 --> 00:48:31,671
Hey, you guys, I brought out some watermelon.

814
00:48:31,726 --> 00:48:33,292
Oh, nice. Thanks a lot.

815
00:48:33,317 --> 00:48:34,096
Okay.

816
00:48:39,054 --> 00:48:41,125
Hey, wait. I said wait!

817
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:50,421
Just great.

818
00:48:54,982 --> 00:48:56,944
Ah, what the hell?

819
00:48:59,184 --> 00:49:00,630
I said wait!

820
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:17,020
Whoa, guys. You got to cut me some slack.

821
00:49:17,258 --> 00:49:19,323
I didn't know she was a minor. I swear.

822
00:49:21,307 --> 00:49:23,597
Huh? Wait, so this isn't about the girl?

823
00:49:23,632 --> 00:49:25,270
That's what we've been trying to tell you.

824
00:49:26,066 --> 00:49:27,980
You made us run for nothing.

825
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:29,875
This is you, is it not?

826
00:49:29,899 --> 00:49:30,490
What?

827
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,151
Take a good look.

828
00:49:33,376 --> 00:49:35,732
What do you know about the boy in the video?

829
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,302
So, the kid's about high-school age, huh?

830
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:45,370
Maybe he picked up the gun
Shibata threw away by pure accident.

831
00:49:46,594 --> 00:49:49,795
If that's the case, then the
kid might have posted about it.

832
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,218
Oh. You mean online.

833
00:49:54,181 --> 00:49:55,674
Yeah, nothing is private.

834
00:49:55,699 --> 00:49:58,177
Kids post everything on social media these days.

835
00:50:14,933 --> 00:50:17,355
Go, Nagi, go!

836
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,269
Yeah!

837
00:50:18,294 --> 00:50:19,198
That was amazing, Nagi!

838
00:50:19,223 --> 00:50:20,254
Yeah! Great shot!

839
00:50:23,903 --> 00:50:25,939
A ring. Definitely a ring.

840
00:50:26,312 --> 00:50:28,829
What? You sure it's not too much?

841
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:31,236
We're talking about my sister's birthday, right?

842
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:34,486
I did ask a woman for ideas, but...

843
00:50:34,517 --> 00:50:35,899
I know what I'd like.

844
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:37,948
Hugs and kisses, money,

845
00:50:38,148 --> 00:50:40,500
boyfriend and a real job.

846
00:50:40,611 --> 00:50:42,660
But she wasn't very helpful.

847
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:45,079
See you later, Nagi.

848
00:50:45,353 --> 00:50:46,711
See you around, Nagi.

849
00:50:46,948 --> 00:50:47,715
Mm-hmm.

850
00:50:48,007 --> 00:50:50,716
Just admit it. You're in love with my sister.

851
00:50:50,851 --> 00:50:51,447
Huh?

852
00:50:52,376 --> 00:50:54,069
No, it's-it's noth-nothing like that.

853
00:50:54,094 --> 00:50:56,135
Uh, oh, wait. What if it is? Then what?

854
00:50:56,175 --> 00:50:57,272
You know...

855
00:50:57,297 --> 00:50:59,859
Being ambivalent is the worst thing as a man.

856
00:50:59,899 --> 00:51:01,450
Uh, is that true?

857
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,659
Be clear before you start going out.

858
00:51:03,778 --> 00:51:06,297
Then you can be vague. Those are the basics.

859
00:51:08,434 --> 00:51:10,611
I should call you "Sempai."

860
00:51:13,256 --> 00:51:14,899
Ever since our mom died,

861
00:51:14,924 --> 00:51:16,831
my sister's been working nonstop.

862
00:51:17,173 --> 00:51:19,713
I know the reason she's doing it is for me.

863
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:21,073
'Cause I'm still a kid.

864
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:24,378
So that's why

865
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:26,937
I want to see her get to do more teenage stuff.

866
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:30,153
But you're gonna have to prove
you're the guy for the job, okay?

867
00:51:32,388 --> 00:51:34,247
Here you go. Enjoy.

868
00:51:37,391 --> 00:51:38,266
Thank you.

869
00:51:38,655 --> 00:51:39,333
But, uh...

870
00:51:39,784 --> 00:51:41,230
do you think she'll like it?

871
00:51:41,508 --> 00:51:42,216
Huh?

872
00:51:43,763 --> 00:51:44,750
Don't worry.

873
00:51:44,877 --> 00:51:46,942
We spent three hours picking it out.

874
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:49,460
If it were me, I'd be very happy.

875
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:51,930
Good luck, okay?

876
00:51:56,897 --> 00:51:59,296
Tomorrow's sunshine girl job will be our last.

877
00:52:00,243 --> 00:52:04,387
Our customer is a man who requested good weather
at the park so that he could play with his daughter.

878
00:52:06,279 --> 00:52:07,574
After that appointment,

879
00:52:08,573 --> 00:52:10,378
I plan on giving Hina the ring.

880
00:52:21,734 --> 00:52:24,696
Daddy, can you do it one more time?

881
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:27,414
Okay. Are you ready?

882
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:34,017
Oh, man.

883
00:52:34,335 --> 00:52:35,948
That was tough on my back.

884
00:52:36,187 --> 00:52:38,283
Of all the people that could have hired us.

885
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:40,547
Did you already know I was doing this as a side job, huh?

886
00:52:40,626 --> 00:52:44,263
I bet you knew this entire time and said
nothing. And since when have you had a daughter?!

887
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,624
Well, I'm impressed.

888
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:49,253
The forecast said it'd be 100% rain today.

889
00:52:50,326 --> 00:52:53,416
Yeah, unfortunately, my daughter has asthma.

890
00:52:53,987 --> 00:52:58,008
And she lives with her grandmother, who
won't let me see her if it's raining out, so...

891
00:52:58,214 --> 00:52:59,652
it's been tough lately.

892
00:53:00,869 --> 00:53:04,086
There's nothing more gorgeous than a beautiful, clear sky.

893
00:53:04,111 --> 00:53:04,953
I concur.

894
00:53:05,176 --> 00:53:06,698
I take it you're Hodaka's boss, then?

895
00:53:06,788 --> 00:53:09,083
Yep. I also saved his life.

896
00:53:09,575 --> 00:53:11,525
Hey, does your friend always speak so formally?

897
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:14,471
Huh? Well, Hina is a whole two years older than me.

898
00:53:14,534 --> 00:53:15,840
What? Ridiculous.

899
00:53:15,925 --> 00:53:18,108
16, 17, 18... There's no difference.

900
00:53:18,133 --> 00:53:18,900
Yeah, there is!

901
00:53:18,924 --> 00:53:19,619
Yeah, you're right.

902
00:53:19,644 --> 00:53:20,701
Ugh! There you are.

903
00:53:20,843 --> 00:53:22,184
Hey!

904
00:53:22,278 --> 00:53:23,432
Did I miss anything?

905
00:53:23,646 --> 00:53:25,575
Wh-What are you gonna do about her?

906
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,782
Aren't you gonna be in trouble?

907
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:27,420
Hmm?

908
00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:30,114
I mean, does Natsumi even know that you're married?

909
00:53:30,606 --> 00:53:32,760
What's wrong? You okay?

910
00:53:36,145 --> 00:53:39,411
Hodaka, he... he actually thought you were my...

911
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:41,419
Mistress?!

912
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:45,328
Hang on. You never mentioned that she's your niece.

913
00:53:45,353 --> 00:53:48,164
So, this whole time, you had disgusting fantasies?

914
00:53:48,189 --> 00:53:49,412
That is so perverted.

915
00:53:50,142 --> 00:53:52,288
Classic Hodaka.

916
00:53:54,774 --> 00:53:55,970
Hmm.

917
00:53:56,196 --> 00:53:57,357
Are you looking at my boobs?

918
00:53:57,382 --> 00:53:58,317
I am not!

919
00:53:59,351 --> 00:54:00,717
Natsumi!

920
00:54:00,742 --> 00:54:02,643
Hey, Moka. What do you got there?

921
00:54:02,678 --> 00:54:04,842
Daddy, look! A flower crown.

922
00:54:04,913 --> 00:54:05,649
I made it for you!

923
00:54:05,673 --> 00:54:06,947
Yeah? Let me see.

924
00:54:07,145 --> 00:54:08,527
Hodaka, join us.

925
00:54:08,552 --> 00:54:10,432
Uh, Sempai calls.

926
00:54:13,063 --> 00:54:14,613
Hodaka is such a riot.

927
00:54:14,716 --> 00:54:16,130
He is such a child.

928
00:54:16,505 --> 00:54:19,602
They're like the older and younger
versions of each other, don't you think?

929
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,291
Hodaka and Mr. Suga?

930
00:54:21,315 --> 00:54:22,064
Yeah.

931
00:54:22,183 --> 00:54:25,679
Kei ran away from home and came to
Tokyo when he was a teenager, too.

932
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:28,722
Then he met and fell madly in love with his future wife.

933
00:54:29,908 --> 00:54:32,965
But then, a few years ago, she died in an accident.

934
00:54:33,342 --> 00:54:35,543
He's still very much in love with her, though.

935
00:54:37,478 --> 00:54:38,390
It's so good to meet you.

936
00:54:38,414 --> 00:54:40,465
I've been wanting to for a long time.

937
00:54:41,005 --> 00:54:43,620
You're the real sunshine girl. That's amazing!

938
00:54:43,698 --> 00:54:46,764
I wish I had a special skill
to put on my résumé like that.

939
00:54:46,789 --> 00:54:49,325
I hate looking for a job. Too bad I'm not in high school.

940
00:54:50,547 --> 00:54:51,412
It's funny.

941
00:54:52,113 --> 00:54:54,511
'Cause for me, I can't wait to grow up.

942
00:54:54,854 --> 00:54:55,671
Huh.

943
00:54:56,331 --> 00:54:58,399
Yeah, I understand that.

944
00:54:58,587 --> 00:54:59,983
I'm glad you're
doing well, though.

945
00:55:00,008 --> 00:55:00,467
Huh?

946
00:55:01,023 --> 00:55:02,916
Actually, I was a bit worried about you.

947
00:55:03,551 --> 00:55:04,237
Huh?

948
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,381
You okay, Moka? You tired?

949
00:55:14,416 --> 00:55:15,486
Here you go.

950
00:55:15,754 --> 00:55:17,940
One, two, three.

951
00:55:19,673 --> 00:55:21,991
I'm fine. I want to keep playing.

952
00:55:22,016 --> 00:55:23,390
I know, but it's raining.

953
00:55:23,415 --> 00:55:25,625
We're taking off. Have a good day, okay?

954
00:55:26,109 --> 00:55:29,258
But I want to hang out with Nagi some more.

955
00:55:29,283 --> 00:55:31,069
Then why don't we all grab some dinner?

956
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:32,421
I'm sorry, but...

957
00:55:32,446 --> 00:55:34,412
Hey, how about I just go eat with Moka, then?

958
00:55:34,462 --> 00:55:35,408
Would that be okay?

959
00:55:35,606 --> 00:55:36,157
Great.

960
00:55:36,217 --> 00:55:37,371
Yay!

961
00:55:37,775 --> 00:55:39,498
Hodaka, can you take Hina home?

962
00:55:39,554 --> 00:55:40,109
Uh...

963
00:55:41,198 --> 00:55:42,208
Hey, whoa, uh...

964
00:55:44,187 --> 00:55:47,490
Hina, thank you for bringing the sunshine today.

965
00:55:49,009 --> 00:55:50,184
Thank you.

966
00:55:50,501 --> 00:55:52,086
I'm happy you're happy.

967
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:08,719
Oh, my God.

968
00:56:09,705 --> 00:56:11,834
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

969
00:56:12,088 --> 00:56:13,407
This might be...

970
00:56:14,177 --> 00:56:15,639
the very first time that...

971
00:56:16,695 --> 00:56:18,601
I tell someone I love them.

972
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:29,744
Hina, I...!

973
00:56:29,769 --> 00:56:30,101
Hodaka.

974
00:56:30,197 --> 00:56:30,876
Oh, sorry.

975
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:31,404
Uh...

976
00:56:32,467 --> 00:56:33,307
What is it?

977
00:56:33,331 --> 00:56:34,561
Nothing in particular.

978
00:56:34,907 --> 00:56:36,399
What did you want to say?

979
00:56:40,411 --> 00:56:41,533
Hodaka,

980
00:56:41,975 --> 00:56:43,692
so, um...

981
00:56:46,479 --> 00:56:47,511
I...

982
00:56:58,230 --> 00:56:59,111
Hina!

983
00:57:04,992 --> 00:57:05,849
Hodaka!

984
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:07,621
Where are you, Hina?

985
00:57:36,644 --> 00:57:38,605
I think I know when I became

986
00:57:38,695 --> 00:57:39,861
a sunshine girl.

987
00:57:41,165 --> 00:57:45,335
It was one year ago, on that day.

988
00:57:51,154 --> 00:57:54,218
I spent the entire day before praying for good weather.

989
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:58,897
I wanted to have one last walk under the sun with my mom.

990
00:58:05,389 --> 00:58:06,796
And then I saw it.

991
00:58:07,312 --> 00:58:09,123
It looked like a pool of light.

992
00:58:09,504 --> 00:58:13,882
And praying with all my heart, I crossed the shrine gate.

993
00:58:25,862 --> 00:58:29,971
When I finally came to, I was lying on the ground,

994
00:58:30,535 --> 00:58:32,434
and the sky was clear.

995
00:58:39,798 --> 00:58:41,665
I think that's when it happened.

996
00:58:42,094 --> 00:58:43,047
That's when...

997
00:58:43,317 --> 00:58:45,573
I became connected to the sky.

998
00:58:51,591 --> 00:58:54,417
Is it true? Connected to the sky?

999
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:58,961
Hodaka, don't come out.

1000
00:59:01,836 --> 00:59:04,459
It's the police. Sorry for the late visit.

1001
00:59:04,546 --> 00:59:05,452
The police?

1002
00:59:05,993 --> 00:59:06,780
Look again.

1003
00:59:06,805 --> 00:59:08,479
You sure you haven't seen him before?

1004
00:59:09,574 --> 00:59:13,404
Someone fitting his description has
been reported several times in this area.

1005
00:59:13,777 --> 00:59:14,931
I don't know him.

1006
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,051
May I ask what he's done?

1007
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,991
We just want to ask him some questions. That's all.

1008
00:59:20,134 --> 00:59:21,828
He's a minor and a runaway.

1009
00:59:22,136 --> 00:59:25,198
Additionally, his parents have
filed a missing persons report.

1010
00:59:26,166 --> 00:59:29,827
We've also been told that you live
here on your own with your little brother.

1011
00:59:29,867 --> 00:59:30,988
Is that correct?

1012
00:59:31,535 --> 00:59:32,243
Yes.

1013
00:59:32,386 --> 00:59:34,666
That, unfortunately, is another issue.

1014
00:59:35,287 --> 00:59:37,963
Children cannot live on their own without a guardian.

1015
00:59:37,988 --> 00:59:38,568
But...!

1016
00:59:38,956 --> 00:59:39,718
Sorry.

1017
00:59:39,978 --> 00:59:42,420
But we're quiet and don't cause trouble.

1018
00:59:45,479 --> 00:59:46,027
Hina.

1019
00:59:46,805 --> 00:59:49,761
She said that she was going to come back tomorrow,

1020
00:59:49,817 --> 00:59:51,224
bring child services.

1021
00:59:51,374 --> 00:59:52,693
What do I do?

1022
00:59:52,733 --> 00:59:54,322
They're going to separate us.

1023
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:55,657
I just know it.

1024
01:00:07,871 --> 01:00:09,843
Hodaka, the police.

1025
01:00:09,878 --> 01:00:10,763
They were just...

1026
01:00:11,291 --> 01:00:11,899
I know.

1027
01:00:12,018 --> 01:00:13,742
Go inside. I'll be back tomorrow.

1028
01:00:16,563 --> 01:00:17,705
Mr. Suga?

1029
01:00:18,412 --> 01:00:20,224
Hey. Like the new look?

1030
01:00:20,568 --> 01:00:22,371
I'm in disguise.

1031
01:00:22,997 --> 01:00:25,698
Earlier today, the police stopped by my office.

1032
01:00:26,238 --> 01:00:28,502
They're treating your disappearance as a kidnapping.

1033
01:00:29,169 --> 01:00:32,729
I denied any involvement, but I
can tell they still suspect me.

1034
01:00:33,436 --> 01:00:35,518
Consider this your severance pay.

1035
01:00:35,577 --> 01:00:35,986
Huh?

1036
01:00:36,494 --> 01:00:40,235
I can't have you coming back to the office.
If they catch you there, they'll arrest me.

1037
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:47,332
I'm in the process of filing for custody of my daughter,

1038
01:00:47,444 --> 01:00:49,755
so I got to be careful, understand?

1039
01:00:50,461 --> 01:00:53,242
If I were you, I'd head back home tomorrow.

1040
01:00:53,472 --> 01:00:56,023
Then everything can go back to normal.

1041
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:57,883
It'll be best for everyone.

1042
01:00:58,112 --> 01:00:59,455
You'll see.

1043
01:01:01,601 --> 01:01:04,142
Time to grow up, little man. Got it?

1044
01:01:13,821 --> 01:01:15,408
We can't stay here anymore.

1045
01:01:15,781 --> 01:01:17,761
But... where will you go?

1046
01:01:17,786 --> 01:01:19,564
I don't know, but...

1047
01:01:20,835 --> 01:01:24,037
Hey, it doesn't matter where
we go, as long as we're together.

1048
01:01:24,236 --> 01:01:28,789
Hmm. Hodaka, you should probably go
home before you get caught by the police.

1049
01:01:29,297 --> 01:01:31,306
At least you've got a place to go back to.

1050
01:01:31,885 --> 01:01:32,798
Don't say that.

1051
01:01:35,437 --> 01:01:37,351
Don't worry. We're gonna be fine.

1052
01:01:38,972 --> 01:01:39,750
No way.

1053
01:01:40,265 --> 01:01:41,450
I'm not going back.

1054
01:01:42,689 --> 01:01:43,882
Let's run away!

1055
01:01:49,923 --> 01:01:54,639
A special heavy rain advisory has
just been issued in the Tokyo area.

1056
01:01:54,828 --> 01:01:56,047
It could be the heaviest downpour

1057
01:01:56,072 --> 01:01:58,218
that the city has experienced in decades.

1058
01:01:58,253 --> 01:02:01,084
Lowland communities should be prepared for flash flooding.

1059
01:02:01,109 --> 01:02:03,720
A sudden typhoon-strength low-pressure system is...

1060
01:02:04,204 --> 01:02:05,635
River levels rising.

1061
01:02:05,881 --> 01:02:07,644
Increased risk of flooding.

1062
01:02:07,979 --> 01:02:09,853
The dam is not going to hold!

1063
01:02:09,878 --> 01:02:12,539
Keep calm and slowly make your way towards the exit.

1064
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:16,803
The Namboku Line at Akabane-Iwabuchi
Station, the Shibuya Metro...

1065
01:02:16,828 --> 01:02:19,762
Outgoing flights have been canceled from Haneda Airport.

1066
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:23,735
Over six inches of rain is falling per hour, and
heavy flooding has been reported in many areas in Tokyo.

1067
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,056
Sir, are you okay?

1068
01:02:25,212 --> 01:02:27,158
Kita Ward, Arakawa Ward,

1069
01:02:27,269 --> 01:02:29,526
Taito Ward, Sumida Ward, Shibuya...

1070
01:02:29,573 --> 01:02:31,924
Please head home immediately.

1071
01:02:32,053 --> 01:02:34,023
It's really cold, right?

1072
01:02:34,048 --> 01:02:36,089
It has been a record-breaking August.

1073
01:02:36,124 --> 01:02:39,138
The temperature in Tokyo has fallen below 50 degrees.

1074
01:02:39,163 --> 01:02:40,688
Cumulonimbi continue to gather above Tokyo.

1075
01:02:40,713 --> 01:02:42,111
In merely an hour,

1076
01:02:42,143 --> 01:02:43,979
Tokyo's landscape has been transformed.

1077
01:02:44,169 --> 01:02:47,912
I repeat, a heavy rain special advisory
has been issued for the greater Tokyo area.

1078
01:02:47,966 --> 01:02:49,539
This is looking to be the heaviest rainfall

1079
01:02:49,564 --> 01:02:50,982
recorded in the last few decades.

1080
01:02:51,006 --> 01:02:51,994
A low-pressure system over the Kanto region...

1081
01:02:52,019 --> 01:02:56,709
The stream of cold air that passed over
Kanto on the 21st is the cause of the current...

1082
01:02:56,733 --> 01:02:59,096
Active rainclouds will remain over
east and central Japan at least...

1083
01:02:59,121 --> 01:03:02,172
The Meteorological Agency has
stated that this abnormal weather

1084
01:03:02,197 --> 01:03:03,214
will continue for at least the next few weeks.

1085
01:03:03,239 --> 01:03:08,582
Experts warn that the current weather pattern we
are seeing is unprecedented and extremely dangerous.

1086
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:18,775
Trains on the Yamanote Line are
indefinitely delayed due to the heavy rains.

1087
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:22,482
There is no way to resume
operations until the weather clears up.

1088
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:23,554
Let's just get off here.

1089
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:25,515
Oh, I'll ask my mom to pick us up.

1090
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:26,622
It's freezing.

1091
01:03:26,741 --> 01:03:27,790
What should we do?

1092
01:03:27,922 --> 01:03:29,126
Hey, don't worry.

1093
01:03:29,475 --> 01:03:31,501
Let's find a place to stay tonight.

1094
01:03:32,605 --> 01:03:35,074
I'm sorry, but we don't have anything available.

1095
01:03:35,122 --> 01:03:36,084
We're fully booked.

1096
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:37,657
Do you have a reservation?

1097
01:03:37,776 --> 01:03:38,873
We're all full.

1098
01:03:39,125 --> 01:03:40,923
There's no adult with you?

1099
01:03:41,185 --> 01:03:43,306
One last thing... I need to see your I.D.

1100
01:03:43,377 --> 01:03:45,101
We can't accept unaccompanied minors.

1101
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:46,984
This ain't about the money.

1102
01:03:47,087 --> 01:03:48,668
It's not about the money!

1103
01:03:50,408 --> 01:03:51,417
Be honest.

1104
01:03:51,942 --> 01:03:53,665
Are you kids runaways?

1105
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:04,439
Hina, Hodaka, look.

1106
01:04:05,536 --> 01:04:07,450
Is that snow?

1107
01:05:01,594 --> 01:05:02,904
Could it be true?

1108
01:05:04,262 --> 01:05:06,621
That Hina is connected to the sky?

1109
01:05:18,692 --> 01:05:20,232
It's freezing.

1110
01:05:21,615 --> 01:05:24,424
Hey, Kei, it's snowing in August.

1111
01:05:24,856 --> 01:05:27,239
It's official... The world's gone crazy.

1112
01:05:27,509 --> 01:05:28,061
Hmm?

1113
01:05:29,064 --> 01:05:29,606
Oh.

1114
01:05:30,330 --> 01:05:33,644
It is difficult to believe,
but it is snowing here in Tokyo.

1115
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:36,273
Kei, wake up. Hey, you'll catch a cold.

1116
01:05:37,622 --> 01:05:38,325
Asuka.

1117
01:05:41,611 --> 01:05:42,375
Asuka.

1118
01:05:42,787 --> 01:05:44,733
Kei, you, too. Smile!

1119
01:05:50,397 --> 01:05:51,627
Oh, it's cold.

1120
01:05:51,843 --> 01:05:54,465
Careful. You're starting to act like an old man.

1121
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:56,611
That's what happens when you're old.

1122
01:05:59,321 --> 01:06:03,143
You have to make tough choices 'cause
you've got different priorities, you know.

1123
01:06:03,454 --> 01:06:04,998
What are you saying?

1124
01:06:05,145 --> 01:06:06,369
Where's Hodaka?

1125
01:06:06,576 --> 01:06:08,117
You kicked him out?!

1126
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:09,634
I don't believe you.

1127
01:06:09,888 --> 01:06:11,692
I told you, the police showed up.

1128
01:06:12,057 --> 01:06:14,687
I've got to protect myself, not some stranger.

1129
01:06:14,901 --> 01:06:18,896
What? And how are you protecting
yourself by smoking and drinking again?

1130
01:06:19,531 --> 01:06:21,390
Not cool. Meow.

1131
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:23,926
See? Even Rain's judging you.

1132
01:06:24,076 --> 01:06:26,787
Not only is it uncool; it's so last century.

1133
01:06:26,826 --> 01:06:28,955
Don't get near me. I don't want you to rub off on me.

1134
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:31,728
Ah, you're not exactly cool, either.

1135
01:06:31,855 --> 01:06:33,293
What's her name... Hina?

1136
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:35,884
If the story about the Weather Maiden is true,

1137
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:39,362
that she's a human sacrifice, then one day she'll...

1138
01:06:39,387 --> 01:06:40,700
I know, but then...

1139
01:06:41,183 --> 01:06:42,700
what was I supposed to do?

1140
01:06:42,907 --> 01:06:44,704
Ah, come on, relax.

1141
01:06:44,758 --> 01:06:46,434
It's all bullshit anyway.

1142
01:06:47,681 --> 01:06:49,706
Besides, if it were true...

1143
01:06:54,357 --> 01:06:59,572
if you could fix this crazy weather with
one human sacrifice, I'd be fine with it.

1144
01:07:00,747 --> 01:07:02,011
Everyone would.

1145
01:07:03,802 --> 01:07:09,295
A heavy rain and heavy snow advisory has
been issued for Tokyo and its surrounding areas.

1146
01:07:09,767 --> 01:07:13,763
Residents are urged to stay
indoors at all times if possible.

1147
01:07:13,866 --> 01:07:15,464
You kids, hold up.

1148
01:07:16,091 --> 01:07:18,824
It's dangerous to walk around right now unsupervised.

1149
01:07:19,007 --> 01:07:19,950
What are you doing out?

1150
01:07:19,975 --> 01:07:20,880
These your siblings?

1151
01:07:20,905 --> 01:07:21,765
I... Yeah, we're, uh...

1152
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:23,537
We're actually on our way home.

1153
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:26,428
I-I'm a college student, and
these are my younger brothers.

1154
01:07:26,453 --> 01:07:28,495
Hmm. I understand, but...

1155
01:07:29,138 --> 01:07:30,650
I'm gonna need to see some I.D.

1156
01:07:30,766 --> 01:07:33,053
Oh, I, uh, don't have it on me.

1157
01:07:33,078 --> 01:07:34,724
We may have located the boy.

1158
01:07:34,749 --> 01:07:37,845
We think he might be carrying
a firearm. Proceed with caution.

1159
01:07:38,814 --> 01:07:40,761
And you... you in high school?

1160
01:07:41,118 --> 01:07:43,063
That's a pretty big backpack you got there.

1161
01:07:43,088 --> 01:07:45,321
Can you remove your hood for us, please?

1162
01:07:46,879 --> 01:07:47,410
Hina.

1163
01:07:47,633 --> 01:07:48,134
Huh?

1164
01:07:48,626 --> 01:07:49,691
Run for it!

1165
01:07:51,407 --> 01:07:52,433
Hey, wait!

1166
01:07:53,179 --> 01:07:54,053
Stop!

1167
01:07:56,469 --> 01:07:57,197
Gotcha!

1168
01:07:57,221 --> 01:07:58,351
Let go of me!

1169
01:07:59,065 --> 01:08:00,425
Will you settle down?!

1170
01:08:04,594 --> 01:08:05,479
Get off!

1171
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,363
Stop struggling.

1172
01:08:07,311 --> 01:08:07,936
Stop it! No!

1173
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:08,521
Hodaka!

1174
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:09,646
No!

1175
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:11,878
Stay where you are!

1176
01:08:14,464 --> 01:08:15,309
Hina.

1177
01:08:15,853 --> 01:08:18,028
Please!

1178
01:08:33,521 --> 01:08:34,617
Clear the area!

1179
01:08:39,569 --> 01:08:41,402
Hina, we've got to go.

1180
01:08:41,427 --> 01:08:42,954
Let's go take a closer look.

1181
01:08:43,892 --> 01:08:44,755
Come on.

1182
01:08:54,195 --> 01:08:55,776
It's 280 a night.

1183
01:08:56,263 --> 01:08:56,802
Uh...

1184
01:08:57,223 --> 01:08:58,929
So, can you pay it? 280.

1185
01:08:58,954 --> 01:09:01,027
Oh, y... oh, yes, uh, of course I can.

1186
01:09:11,228 --> 01:09:12,387
It's official.

1187
01:09:12,554 --> 01:09:14,802
Looks like I'm a full-fledged fugitive now.

1188
01:09:14,913 --> 01:09:16,168
That's so cool.

1189
01:09:16,482 --> 01:09:16,819
Huh?

1190
01:09:20,555 --> 01:09:22,643
That almost gave me a heart attack.

1191
01:09:22,753 --> 01:09:23,692
You totally almost got arrested.

1192
01:09:23,734 --> 01:09:25,189
Why are you laughing?

1193
01:09:25,213 --> 01:09:26,203
'Cause it was funny.

1194
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:28,201
I'm glad you think so.

1195
01:09:28,254 --> 01:09:29,182
It's huge.

1196
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:30,692
The bed's huge.

1197
01:09:30,803 --> 01:09:32,145
The bathtub's huge.

1198
01:09:33,585 --> 01:09:34,736
Whoa.

1199
01:09:35,149 --> 01:09:36,853
Hina. Hodaka.

1200
01:09:37,008 --> 01:09:38,187
Let's take a bath together.

1201
01:09:39,178 --> 01:09:40,528
Take it by yourself!

1202
01:09:40,816 --> 01:09:43,715
Fine. Then let's take a boys-only bath together,

1203
01:09:43,787 --> 01:09:44,704
okay, Hodaka?

1204
01:09:44,728 --> 01:09:45,620
Wait, what?

1205
01:09:47,417 --> 01:09:49,856
This is the life.

1206
01:09:49,998 --> 01:09:51,237
What's this do?

1207
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:52,716
Huh?

1208
01:09:54,726 --> 01:09:56,021
Whoa!

1209
01:09:57,307 --> 01:09:58,100
Your turn. Tag.

1210
01:09:58,124 --> 01:09:58,937
My turn. Tag.

1211
01:09:59,732 --> 01:10:01,820
Whoa, so many.

1212
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:02,838
What do you want?

1213
01:10:02,862 --> 01:10:04,230
How about one of each, Sempai?

1214
01:10:04,272 --> 01:10:05,088
Are you sure?

1215
01:10:05,231 --> 01:10:07,145
Yeah. I got severance pay.

1216
01:10:07,288 --> 01:10:10,432
Hina, we're having a huge feast tonight!

1217
01:10:10,598 --> 01:10:11,765
I can't wait.

1218
01:10:15,853 --> 01:10:17,441
Sorry I took so long.

1219
01:10:18,544 --> 01:10:19,686
Uh, it-it's fine.

1220
01:10:30,541 --> 01:10:31,567
Bon appétit.

1221
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:34,268
Hodaka, you want to try some of mine?

1222
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:34,760
Mm.

1223
01:10:34,785 --> 01:10:35,391
Mmm!

1224
01:10:35,629 --> 01:10:36,579
Curry's good.

1225
01:10:36,675 --> 01:10:37,848
So are the noodles.

1226
01:10:37,872 --> 01:10:38,757
I want to try.

1227
01:10:39,574 --> 01:10:41,720
Hey, wait. I don't think those are ready yet.

1228
01:10:41,745 --> 01:10:43,554
It tastes better this way... Al dente.

1229
01:10:43,579 --> 01:10:46,334
My fortune cookie

1230
01:10:46,359 --> 01:10:48,392
Speaks of love again

1231
01:10:48,417 --> 01:10:49,924
Future's looking, looking bright...

1232
01:10:49,949 --> 01:10:52,806
It's that precious thing that is in your heart

1233
01:10:52,859 --> 01:10:55,596
It's the same thing that will soon depart, so...

1234
01:10:55,621 --> 01:10:57,653
God, if you really exist,

1235
01:10:58,293 --> 01:10:59,278
then I beg you.

1236
01:11:00,311 --> 01:11:01,678
This is more than enough.

1237
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:03,545
We don't need anything else.

1238
01:11:04,503 --> 01:11:05,484
We'll manage somehow.

1239
01:11:05,509 --> 01:11:06,634
See how you like it!

1240
01:11:07,843 --> 01:11:08,954
So, please,

1241
01:11:09,805 --> 01:11:11,759
don't throw anything more at us,

1242
01:11:12,211 --> 01:11:15,463
but don't take anything more from us, either.

1243
01:11:16,518 --> 01:11:17,702
I'm begging you.

1244
01:11:18,290 --> 01:11:21,031
Please, God, let us stay like this.

1245
01:11:21,205 --> 01:11:23,859
Together, forever and ever.

1246
01:11:26,958 --> 01:11:28,452
Hina, here.

1247
01:11:28,849 --> 01:11:30,223
Happy 18th birthday.

1248
01:11:31,437 --> 01:11:32,081
Huh?

1249
01:11:32,519 --> 01:11:36,546
It's not much, but, uh, it's something
that I thought would look good on you.

1250
01:11:39,844 --> 01:11:40,830
Thanks.

1251
01:11:44,699 --> 01:11:45,517
Hey.

1252
01:11:46,637 --> 01:11:48,782
Can I ask you something?

1253
01:11:49,623 --> 01:11:51,446
Would you like the rain to stop?

1254
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:53,518
Uh, yes. Yeah.

1255
01:12:01,787 --> 01:12:03,947
I'm a human sacrifice, they say.

1256
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:05,026
Huh?

1257
01:12:06,148 --> 01:12:09,443
Natsumi was the one who told me
about the sunshine girl's fate.

1258
01:12:10,066 --> 01:12:12,822
If the Maiden gets sacrificed, then her body disappears,

1259
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:15,705
but after that, the weather goes back to normal.

1260
01:12:17,439 --> 01:12:18,694
Come on, now.

1261
01:12:18,813 --> 01:12:20,948
You can't believe the stuff in those weird legends.

1262
01:12:20,973 --> 01:12:23,776
I mean, people don't disappear.

1263
01:12:36,554 --> 01:12:37,872
What are you looking at?

1264
01:12:37,927 --> 01:12:39,707
I'm not looking at anything!

1265
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:46,889
I'm looking at you, Hina.

1266
01:12:48,646 --> 01:12:50,758
Come on. Why are you crying, Hodaka?

1267
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:58,211
The more I pray for sunshine, the more my body fades away.

1268
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:01,714
But if I end up dying from this...

1269
01:13:02,564 --> 01:13:04,837
we'll finally get our summers back.

1270
01:13:05,583 --> 01:13:07,002
Take care of Nagi for me.

1271
01:13:07,037 --> 01:13:07,656
No!

1272
01:13:07,767 --> 01:13:08,840
I won't!

1273
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:10,963
'Cause you're not going anywhere.

1274
01:13:11,082 --> 01:13:12,977
We're all gonna live together.

1275
01:13:13,028 --> 01:13:13,726
Hodaka.

1276
01:13:14,068 --> 01:13:16,523
Hina, let's make a promise to each other

1277
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,969
to always be together.

1278
01:13:21,546 --> 01:13:24,468
I'll get a job. I'll take care of us.

1279
01:13:24,658 --> 01:13:26,389
You don't have to be a sunshine girl anymore.

1280
01:13:26,510 --> 01:13:29,077
Your body will go back to normal, and then...

1281
01:13:49,433 --> 01:13:50,521
I had a dream.

1282
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,865
I was still on the island.

1283
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:02,755
I wanted to leave.

1284
01:14:03,294 --> 01:14:04,885
I pedaled as fast as I could.

1285
01:14:05,035 --> 01:14:08,045
I was desperate, wanting to go into the light.

1286
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:10,350
When I finally reached it,

1287
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:13,551
I discovered I had reached a dead end.

1288
01:14:14,489 --> 01:14:16,078
That's when I decided

1289
01:14:16,943 --> 01:14:18,772
that I was gonna go into that light.

1290
01:14:20,049 --> 01:14:21,175
And at the edge of it,

1291
01:14:22,442 --> 01:14:23,656
I found you.

1292
01:14:26,869 --> 01:14:28,187
I had a dream...

1293
01:14:29,617 --> 01:14:31,086
the day I met you.

1294
01:14:33,564 --> 01:14:34,064
Huh?

1295
01:14:34,575 --> 01:14:36,639
You looked like a lost kitten.

1296
01:14:38,827 --> 01:14:41,804
But you helped me find a reason to live.

1297
01:14:43,443 --> 01:14:47,063
I continued working as the sunshine
girl because it made me happy.

1298
01:14:47,874 --> 01:14:49,794
I liked making people smile.

1299
01:14:50,368 --> 01:14:52,386
I'm really glad I met you.

1300
01:14:53,945 --> 01:14:57,393
So, please, don't cry, Hodaka.

1301
01:15:12,274 --> 01:15:13,799
Where am I?

1302
01:15:17,487 --> 01:15:18,558
Hodaka.

1303
01:16:06,867 --> 01:16:07,999
Oh, no. Hina?

1304
01:16:08,102 --> 01:16:09,635
Where are you?!

1305
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:10,818
Hina?!

1306
01:16:11,119 --> 01:16:12,104
Hina!

1307
01:16:12,192 --> 01:16:13,924
Hodaka, what is it?

1308
01:16:14,156 --> 01:16:15,839
Your sister's disappeared!

1309
01:16:15,864 --> 01:16:16,570
She's gone.

1310
01:16:18,151 --> 01:16:19,875
I was just dreaming...

1311
01:16:20,647 --> 01:16:23,338
that she disappeared into the sky.

1312
01:16:28,601 --> 01:16:29,601
It can't be.

1313
01:16:32,072 --> 01:16:32,857
Open the door.

1314
01:16:33,939 --> 01:16:34,717
Open up.

1315
01:16:34,836 --> 01:16:35,844
What?

1316
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:40,168
Are you Hodaka Morishima?

1317
01:16:40,787 --> 01:16:43,123
You're the subject of a missing persons report.

1318
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:46,856
We also believe that you're in
possession of an illegal firearm.

1319
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:48,216
I need you to come to the station.

1320
01:16:48,241 --> 01:16:49,566
Let go of me!

1321
01:16:49,685 --> 01:16:50,943
It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you.

1322
01:16:50,968 --> 01:16:51,527
No!

1323
01:16:52,008 --> 01:16:52,999
We're taking a little trip.

1324
01:16:53,024 --> 01:16:53,840
Sempai!

1325
01:16:53,865 --> 01:16:56,098
Don't make this any harder than it has to be.

1326
01:17:09,066 --> 01:17:10,416
Why are you stopping?

1327
01:17:14,525 --> 01:17:19,378
After months of intense rain, the Kanto
region is finally seeing some brilliant sunshine.

1328
01:17:19,616 --> 01:17:22,684
The sun's rays are making yesterday's
storms seem like a crazy dream.

1329
01:17:22,709 --> 01:17:24,955
In a matter of hours, the weather has done a 180.

1330
01:17:24,979 --> 01:17:27,913
By 8:00 a.m., the temperature was 25 degrees Celsius.

1331
01:17:27,938 --> 01:17:31,050
Many areas adjacent to the
Arakawa River have remained flooded.

1332
01:17:31,085 --> 01:17:32,686
The trains are still not running.

1333
01:17:32,711 --> 01:17:35,536
The extent of the damage has yet to be ascertained.

1334
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:39,170
Authorities say it will take at least
a week to restore municipal services,

1335
01:17:39,195 --> 01:17:42,284
as long as the weather remains clear.

1336
01:17:42,724 --> 01:17:43,539
The sky's clear.

1337
01:17:43,564 --> 01:17:44,905
Oh, so sunny.

1338
01:17:44,964 --> 01:17:46,346
Oh, it's so bright.

1339
01:17:46,576 --> 01:17:48,167
The sky's actually clear.

1340
01:17:48,347 --> 01:17:49,984
It's making me all emotional.

1341
01:17:50,009 --> 01:17:51,025
Well, it took a while,

1342
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:52,859
but summer has finally arrived.

1343
01:18:03,537 --> 01:18:05,018
Hey. Hurry up.

1344
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:09,598
This is Hina's.

1345
01:18:10,711 --> 01:18:12,038
She sacrificed.

1346
01:18:13,054 --> 01:18:14,760
Hina! What happened to you?!

1347
01:18:14,784 --> 01:18:15,524
Hey. Where are you going?

1348
01:18:15,549 --> 01:18:16,071
Hina!

1349
01:18:16,095 --> 01:18:17,013
Calm down.

1350
01:18:21,819 --> 01:18:24,258
I have something I need you to confirm for me.

1351
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:28,530
The girl who disappeared last
night is 15-year-old Hina Amano.

1352
01:18:28,688 --> 01:18:29,508
Is that correct?

1353
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:32,959
Do you have any idea where she could be?

1354
01:18:34,404 --> 01:18:35,247
She's 15?

1355
01:18:35,421 --> 01:18:36,899
Hina said she was older.

1356
01:18:37,118 --> 01:18:38,344
Isn't she 18?

1357
01:18:39,536 --> 01:18:43,046
She's been lying about her age on
her résumés and job applications.

1358
01:18:43,379 --> 01:18:46,669
I understand she needed to make a living,
but the truth is she's in middle school.

1359
01:18:47,273 --> 01:18:49,363
Or at least legally she's supposed to be.

1360
01:18:49,794 --> 01:18:50,730
You didn't know?

1361
01:18:52,613 --> 01:18:53,772
I don't believe it.

1362
01:18:54,742 --> 01:18:56,044
I'm the one who's older?

1363
01:18:58,596 --> 01:18:59,292
Oh, what a pain.

1364
01:18:59,317 --> 01:18:59,994
This whole time.

1365
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:03,234
Hey. Do you know where she is or not?

1366
01:19:05,403 --> 01:19:06,714
The weather cleared up

1367
01:19:06,904 --> 01:19:09,685
only because Hina sacrificed herself in exchange.

1368
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:10,249
Huh?

1369
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:12,124
No one knows the truth!

1370
01:19:12,453 --> 01:19:14,578
No one knows her sacrifice.

1371
01:19:15,246 --> 01:19:16,422
What a pain.

1372
01:19:16,788 --> 01:19:18,575
Should we get a psychiatrist?

1373
01:19:23,399 --> 01:19:24,748
It's clear.

1374
01:19:29,722 --> 01:19:30,369
Huh.

1375
01:19:39,004 --> 01:19:40,837
Daddy, did you look outside?

1376
01:19:40,956 --> 01:19:42,404
Yeah, I did.

1377
01:19:42,642 --> 01:19:44,382
I had a dream about Hina.

1378
01:19:44,612 --> 01:19:46,530
She's the one who brought the sunshine back.

1379
01:19:46,582 --> 01:19:47,923
I know it.

1380
01:19:53,230 --> 01:19:55,868
Yeah. I think you might be right.

1381
01:19:59,515 --> 01:20:00,375
Excuse me.

1382
01:20:00,731 --> 01:20:03,614
Detective, I have a favor to ask you.

1383
01:20:04,552 --> 01:20:05,237
What is it?

1384
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:06,633
Let me go.

1385
01:20:07,533 --> 01:20:09,280
I need to go out there and look for Hina.

1386
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:10,765
It's my turn to help her now.

1387
01:20:10,845 --> 01:20:12,362
I'll come back as soon as I find her.

1388
01:20:12,854 --> 01:20:16,226
What you need to do is step in
here and answer some of my questions.

1389
01:20:16,266 --> 01:20:16,996
Understood?

1390
01:20:17,877 --> 01:20:20,618
Tell Yasui we're about to begin the interrogation.

1391
01:20:21,182 --> 01:20:21,802
Yes, sir.

1392
01:20:22,946 --> 01:20:23,389
Huh?

1393
01:20:23,535 --> 01:20:25,473
Hey! Get back here!

1394
01:20:28,539 --> 01:20:29,633
Stop running!

1395
01:20:29,668 --> 01:20:30,349
Come back!

1396
01:20:30,668 --> 01:20:32,035
Someone stop him!

1397
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:33,833
Stop! I said stop!

1398
01:20:36,516 --> 01:20:37,392
Do not let the boy in the white T-shirt

1399
01:20:37,417 --> 01:20:38,854
leave the building.

1400
01:20:39,013 --> 01:20:40,606
Stop that kid!

1401
01:20:41,998 --> 01:20:44,000
Wait! Stop!

1402
01:20:48,991 --> 01:20:50,491
Hey! Come back here!

1403
01:20:52,835 --> 01:20:54,086
What the hell?!

1404
01:20:54,430 --> 01:20:55,290
That little shit.

1405
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:56,443
Cut him off.

1406
01:20:56,753 --> 01:20:57,678
You go that way.

1407
01:20:57,702 --> 01:20:58,443
Yes, sir.

1408
01:21:05,809 --> 01:21:06,642
No!

1409
01:21:15,325 --> 01:21:16,359
Hodaka!

1410
01:21:16,582 --> 01:21:17,177
Huh?

1411
01:21:19,608 --> 01:21:20,512
Natsumi?

1412
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:21,911
What are you doing?

1413
01:21:22,416 --> 01:21:24,163
I'm going to get Hina back.

1414
01:21:24,274 --> 01:21:24,925
Huh?

1415
01:21:27,154 --> 01:21:28,125
Get on.

1416
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:35,832
Goddamn punk!

1417
01:21:37,118 --> 01:21:39,074
While you were at the station, Nagi called.

1418
01:21:39,455 --> 01:21:42,553
He said Hina had disappeared and
that the police had arrested you.

1419
01:21:42,704 --> 01:21:43,491
Where is he?

1420
01:21:43,610 --> 01:21:45,811
At a child service center.

1421
01:21:50,284 --> 01:21:51,324
No going back.

1422
01:21:51,777 --> 01:21:53,566
We're about to become outlaws.

1423
01:21:53,764 --> 01:21:55,996
Breaking the law!

1424
01:21:56,623 --> 01:21:58,689
All right, partner, where we headed?

1425
01:22:02,289 --> 01:22:04,523
What? Another visitor?

1426
01:22:07,470 --> 01:22:09,175
Yeah, and it's another girl.

1427
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:10,877
He sure is popular.

1428
01:22:13,437 --> 01:22:14,518
Hello, Nagi.

1429
01:22:14,605 --> 01:22:16,687
Ayane, I'm so glad you could make it.

1430
01:22:17,155 --> 01:22:18,526
Kana, this is Ayane.

1431
01:22:18,550 --> 01:22:19,380
Nice to meet you.

1432
01:22:19,405 --> 01:22:20,957
Ayane, this is Kana.

1433
01:22:20,981 --> 01:22:21,771
My pleasure.

1434
01:22:21,843 --> 01:22:23,309
And that's Officer Sasaki.

1435
01:22:23,804 --> 01:22:25,742
She's going to be watching over me all day.

1436
01:22:25,767 --> 01:22:27,219
Wow. That's so cool.

1437
01:22:27,244 --> 01:22:28,540
It's like you're a celebrity.

1438
01:22:28,691 --> 01:22:29,149
How do you do?

1439
01:22:29,173 --> 01:22:29,820
Nice to meet you.

1440
01:22:30,891 --> 01:22:32,551
Thank you both so much for coming.

1441
01:22:32,853 --> 01:22:35,065
I'm sure you must have been surprised by my call.

1442
01:22:35,102 --> 01:22:36,054
I was.

1443
01:22:36,183 --> 01:22:37,899
When I heard they took you in custody,

1444
01:22:38,018 --> 01:22:39,187
my heart almost stopped.

1445
01:22:39,243 --> 01:22:41,505
Me, too. Mine's still pounding.

1446
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:44,285
Nagi, if you touch my chest, you can feel it.

1447
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:45,495
Yeah, she's right.

1448
01:22:45,598 --> 01:22:47,282
Oh, I do feel it.

1449
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:52,729
Um, excuse me.

1450
01:22:52,753 --> 01:22:53,304
Yes?

1451
01:22:53,367 --> 01:22:56,757
It's-it's my first time here, so I
don't know my way around, and, uh...

1452
01:22:56,781 --> 01:22:57,595
Uh-huh.

1453
01:22:58,040 --> 01:22:59,764
Uh, where's the bathroom?

1454
01:23:00,168 --> 01:23:01,567
Oh.

1455
01:23:04,918 --> 01:23:06,468
Thanks. I owe you one.

1456
01:23:06,650 --> 01:23:08,518
You better. I can't believe you.

1457
01:23:08,645 --> 01:23:11,648
Calling your ex to help you out with something like this?

1458
01:23:12,259 --> 01:23:12,992
Take it.

1459
01:23:13,301 --> 01:23:14,259
Turn around.

1460
01:23:14,372 --> 01:23:16,167
We still need to swap clothes.

1461
01:23:26,299 --> 01:23:29,207
Mr. Keisuke Suga. Good to see you again.

1462
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:30,508
You again?

1463
01:23:30,637 --> 01:23:31,415
What do you want?

1464
01:23:31,697 --> 01:23:34,934
Looks like the weather's finally
back to the way it should be, huh?

1465
01:23:35,545 --> 01:23:38,836
I told you already, I know nothing about that runaway.

1466
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:41,124
Would you mind if we took a look around your office?

1467
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:42,332
What? Hey. It's not a good time.

1468
01:23:42,356 --> 01:23:44,034
Oh, it's really flooded, huh? That's too bad.

1469
01:23:44,058 --> 01:23:46,058
You're not gonna find him down there.

1470
01:23:47,321 --> 01:23:48,837
Yeah, we know.

1471
01:23:48,862 --> 01:23:51,196
This is embarrassing, but, uh, the truth is...

1472
01:23:51,286 --> 01:23:53,414
Huh? What do you mean, he ran away?

1473
01:23:53,442 --> 01:23:55,138
From the police station?

1474
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:57,775
An abandoned building in Yoyogi?

1475
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,735
Yeah. It's where she became a sunshine...

1476
01:23:59,759 --> 01:24:00,405
Duck!

1477
01:24:02,082 --> 01:24:05,442
She said she became connected
with the sky on that building's roof

1478
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:07,644
and that's how she became the sunshine girl.

1479
01:24:07,715 --> 01:24:10,114
So, I think that's where I have to go.

1480
01:24:15,381 --> 01:24:16,619
Oh, great!

1481
01:24:19,736 --> 01:24:21,151
Hey, on the scooter!

1482
01:24:21,252 --> 01:24:21,827
Pull over!

1483
01:24:22,770 --> 01:24:24,127
Hold on tight.

1484
01:24:31,317 --> 01:24:32,278
Hold on!

1485
01:24:33,114 --> 01:24:34,271
I think that maybe...

1486
01:24:34,295 --> 01:24:34,704
What?

1487
01:24:34,807 --> 01:24:37,435
That I'm totally awesome? I know!

1488
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:39,281
I was born for this stuff.

1489
01:24:39,352 --> 01:24:44,166
That's it... I'm gonna be a motorcycle
cop and catch anyone who speeds!

1490
01:24:44,254 --> 01:24:46,707
They're not gonna hire you after this!

1491
01:24:49,322 --> 01:24:52,206
We have a theory about why the kid escaped.

1492
01:24:52,278 --> 01:24:55,566
We think he may be trying to
search for the girl who he was with.

1493
01:24:55,971 --> 01:25:00,675
You see, he told us a few things that
frankly sounded like science fiction.

1494
01:25:01,071 --> 01:25:06,132
He seems to believe that the girl disappeared
in exchange for the good weather returning.

1495
01:25:07,374 --> 01:25:08,947
That's ridiculous.

1496
01:25:08,979 --> 01:25:10,471
Don't tell me you believe him.

1497
01:25:10,496 --> 01:25:12,014
No, of course I don't.

1498
01:25:12,633 --> 01:25:16,143
But what I do believe is that he's throwing his life away.

1499
01:25:17,915 --> 01:25:20,379
And all of it is just because of some girl.

1500
01:25:20,815 --> 01:25:22,396
To be honest with you,

1501
01:25:22,701 --> 01:25:25,479
I envy the kid to feel that passionately.

1502
01:25:26,821 --> 01:25:29,617
What's the point in sharing that? It doesn't change much.

1503
01:25:31,741 --> 01:25:32,233
Huh?

1504
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:35,451
Mr. Suga, are you, uh...

1505
01:25:35,935 --> 01:25:36,507
Huh?

1506
01:25:38,723 --> 01:25:39,686
Are you okay?

1507
01:25:40,091 --> 01:25:41,114
Why do you ask?

1508
01:25:41,971 --> 01:25:44,378
Well, it's just that you, uh...

1509
01:25:45,278 --> 01:25:46,460
you're crying.

1510
01:25:55,739 --> 01:25:56,884
This is bad.

1511
01:25:59,278 --> 01:26:00,425
We're gonna jump it.

1512
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:01,843
Huh?

1513
01:26:02,216 --> 01:26:03,797
No. Wait.

1514
01:26:11,305 --> 01:26:13,204
Ugh, it's the end of the line.

1515
01:26:13,386 --> 01:26:13,872
Hurry. Get out of here.

1516
01:26:13,907 --> 01:26:14,793
Go on.

1517
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:20,807
Thank you. Wish me luck.

1518
01:26:25,781 --> 01:26:28,030
Hodaka!

1519
01:26:28,689 --> 01:26:30,211
Never give up!

1520
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:54,765
Hina.

1521
01:26:56,209 --> 01:26:58,489
Hina. Hina, Hina!

1522
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:00,602
Hina?

1523
01:27:01,355 --> 01:27:02,557
Hina, are you there?

1524
01:27:03,257 --> 01:27:04,440
Hina!

1525
01:27:06,085 --> 01:27:07,786
Hey, Hodaka.

1526
01:27:08,334 --> 01:27:09,892
It's gonna clear up.

1527
01:27:12,346 --> 01:27:14,388
It's for you, but don't tell.

1528
01:27:14,578 --> 01:27:16,406
Unless you want to have chowder for dinner again.

1529
01:27:16,548 --> 01:27:18,773
Does it hurt? Let me guess... You ran away from home?

1530
01:27:18,798 --> 01:27:21,411
Too bad you can't enjoy Tokyo with all this rain.

1531
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:22,707
You're younger than me.

1532
01:27:22,771 --> 01:27:24,859
I'll be 18 in approximately a month.

1533
01:27:24,884 --> 01:27:25,997
You should treat me with respect.

1534
01:27:26,022 --> 01:27:27,409
Hodaka, have you had lunch yet?

1535
01:27:27,570 --> 01:27:28,847
You just sit right there.

1536
01:27:28,903 --> 01:27:30,381
How do you like living in Tokyo?

1537
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:31,835
Huh? Uh...

1538
01:27:32,041 --> 01:27:34,586
I don't feel like I'm suffocating anymore.

1539
01:27:34,621 --> 01:27:36,897
Well, that's great, right?

1540
01:27:37,047 --> 01:27:39,251
I think I'm in love...

1541
01:27:39,584 --> 01:27:41,919
with this job as the sunshine girl.

1542
01:27:42,236 --> 01:27:43,028
And so...

1543
01:27:43,492 --> 01:27:45,367
thank you, Hodaka.

1544
01:27:48,662 --> 01:27:49,295
Hey, hey, look.

1545
01:27:49,319 --> 01:27:50,744
There's someone on the tracks!

1546
01:27:50,769 --> 01:27:51,655
Who is that?

1547
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:52,302
Stop!

1548
01:27:52,524 --> 01:27:53,427
You can't be here!

1549
01:27:53,451 --> 01:27:54,263
Come back! It's dangerous!

1550
01:27:54,288 --> 01:27:55,707
Hey, hey! What are you doing?

1551
01:27:55,742 --> 01:27:57,959
This place is off-limits!

1552
01:28:00,532 --> 01:28:01,516
What is he doing?

1553
01:28:01,694 --> 01:28:02,619
What is he doing?

1554
01:28:02,643 --> 01:28:03,326
That's so crazy.

1555
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:04,661
There's someone running up there.

1556
01:28:04,685 --> 01:28:05,821
He's gonna get himself arrested.

1557
01:28:05,845 --> 01:28:06,363
Do you see that?

1558
01:28:06,388 --> 01:28:07,659
Some people are such idiots.

1559
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:23,336
I'm sorry.

1560
01:28:23,470 --> 01:28:24,852
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1561
01:28:24,877 --> 01:28:26,204
I'm so sorry, Hina!

1562
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:28,318
I made you do that sunshine girl job,

1563
01:28:28,556 --> 01:28:31,550
but in the end, you were the one
who had to deal with the consequences.

1564
01:28:31,724 --> 01:28:32,145
Hey.

1565
01:28:32,351 --> 01:28:33,996
Can I ask you something?

1566
01:28:35,244 --> 01:28:37,158
Would you like the rain to stop?

1567
01:29:06,046 --> 01:29:07,126
Mr. Suga?

1568
01:29:08,184 --> 01:29:10,115
People are looking for you, Hodaka.

1569
01:29:10,321 --> 01:29:11,481
How did you find me?

1570
01:29:11,663 --> 01:29:12,494
Look at you.

1571
01:29:12,735 --> 01:29:14,279
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

1572
01:29:14,304 --> 01:29:16,113
You don't get it. Hina's gone!

1573
01:29:16,763 --> 01:29:17,915
And it's my fault.

1574
01:29:18,051 --> 01:29:19,791
The sunshine girl job was my idea.

1575
01:29:19,816 --> 01:29:20,960
Hodaka, calm down.

1576
01:29:20,985 --> 01:29:22,239
That's why I have to help her!

1577
01:29:25,368 --> 01:29:26,098
I have to go.

1578
01:29:27,449 --> 01:29:28,172
Hey, wait.

1579
01:29:28,197 --> 01:29:29,349
Where are you...

1580
01:29:29,905 --> 01:29:32,414
I can make it to Heaven if I just go through that.

1581
01:29:34,569 --> 01:29:34,988
What?

1582
01:29:35,013 --> 01:29:35,916
Have you lost it?

1583
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:37,197
She's somewhere in the sky.

1584
01:29:37,222 --> 01:29:38,913
I can get there if I use the stairs!

1585
01:29:38,953 --> 01:29:40,445
Hodaka, stop this.

1586
01:29:40,470 --> 01:29:41,847
There's no way she's up there.

1587
01:29:42,657 --> 01:29:44,001
Snap out of it!

1588
01:29:45,834 --> 01:29:47,501
What's gotten into you?

1589
01:29:47,876 --> 01:29:49,565
You have to go back to the police station.

1590
01:29:49,589 --> 01:29:51,401
If you explain it to them, they'll understand.

1591
01:29:51,425 --> 01:29:52,935
You haven't done anything wrong.

1592
01:29:53,375 --> 01:29:57,963
You can't keep running away from your
problems. They'll catch up to you. You know this.

1593
01:29:58,099 --> 01:30:00,410
We've located the vehicle. We're going in.

1594
01:30:01,166 --> 01:30:02,835
Look don't worry.

1595
01:30:03,033 --> 01:30:04,487
I'll come with you, okay?

1596
01:30:04,789 --> 01:30:06,665
Then we can explain everything together.

1597
01:30:06,729 --> 01:30:07,917
Let go of me!

1598
01:30:08,126 --> 01:30:09,334
I said let go!

1599
01:30:09,493 --> 01:30:10,061
Cut it out!

1600
01:30:10,085 --> 01:30:10,822
Let go!

1601
01:30:12,886 --> 01:30:14,108
Get off of me!

1602
01:30:18,669 --> 01:30:19,951
Get out of my way.

1603
01:30:21,617 --> 01:30:23,755
Hodaka, what are you doing?

1604
01:30:23,865 --> 01:30:27,161
Let me go to Hina. I have to see her!

1605
01:30:49,053 --> 01:30:50,268
Hodaka Morishima!

1606
01:30:50,506 --> 01:30:52,042
Drop the gun!

1607
01:30:52,066 --> 01:30:52,672
Whoa.

1608
01:30:52,926 --> 01:30:54,784
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1609
01:30:54,809 --> 01:30:55,620
Everybody, calm down.

1610
01:30:56,049 --> 01:30:57,479
This is a misunderstanding.

1611
01:30:57,504 --> 01:30:59,053
Don't shoot. I can explain.

1612
01:30:59,355 --> 01:31:00,380
Hodaka, come on.

1613
01:31:02,318 --> 01:31:03,862
Huh? What are you...?

1614
01:31:04,097 --> 01:31:06,361
Don't do this. Put the weapon down.

1615
01:31:06,681 --> 01:31:08,300
I don't want to shoot you.

1616
01:31:21,139 --> 01:31:21,847
Hodaka.

1617
01:31:22,028 --> 01:31:23,114
It's gonna be okay.

1618
01:31:23,149 --> 01:31:24,325
Just do what they say.

1619
01:31:24,618 --> 01:31:25,859
What's wrong with you guys, anyway?

1620
01:31:25,884 --> 01:31:27,097
Give him a break.

1621
01:31:27,122 --> 01:31:28,456
He's just a kid. It's...

1622
01:31:28,481 --> 01:31:29,888
Why can't you leave me alone?

1623
01:31:30,086 --> 01:31:31,620
Why are you standing in my way?

1624
01:31:31,953 --> 01:31:32,991
You don't know anything,

1625
01:31:33,026 --> 01:31:34,941
because you choose to ignore the truth.

1626
01:31:35,338 --> 01:31:36,345
So, please...

1627
01:31:37,181 --> 01:31:39,587
All I want is to see her again.

1628
01:31:40,627 --> 01:31:42,201
I have to see her!

1629
01:31:46,342 --> 01:31:48,128
Stay down!

1630
01:31:49,892 --> 01:31:51,331
Let me go!

1631
01:31:51,775 --> 01:31:54,366
Get your hands off Hodaka right now.

1632
01:31:54,969 --> 01:31:56,186
Get off of him!

1633
01:31:58,481 --> 01:31:59,997
Son of a...

1634
01:32:00,434 --> 01:32:01,737
Hodaka, go!

1635
01:32:01,825 --> 01:32:02,929
What the...

1636
01:32:05,633 --> 01:32:06,537
Hold it!

1637
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:08,381
Hodaka!

1638
01:32:09,785 --> 01:32:10,708
Nagi?

1639
01:32:11,852 --> 01:32:13,688
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

1640
01:32:13,790 --> 01:32:16,691
This is your fault, Hodaka, so you have to fix it!

1641
01:32:16,779 --> 01:32:18,653
Go and bring my sister back!

1642
01:32:53,445 --> 01:32:54,310
God...

1643
01:32:55,141 --> 01:32:57,121
please, please.

1644
01:32:57,607 --> 01:32:58,623
Please!

1645
01:32:58,945 --> 01:33:00,300
I beg you!

1646
01:33:30,130 --> 01:33:31,765
Is that fish?

1647
01:33:32,045 --> 01:33:33,138
In the sky?

1648
01:33:59,292 --> 01:34:01,368
Hina!

1649
01:34:18,956 --> 01:34:20,058
Hina!

1650
01:34:22,094 --> 01:34:23,694
Hina!

1651
01:34:34,708 --> 01:34:36,334
Hina!

1652
01:34:42,873 --> 01:34:43,647
Hina!

1653
01:34:43,706 --> 01:34:44,524
Hodaka!

1654
01:34:51,556 --> 01:34:52,239
Hina!

1655
01:34:52,264 --> 01:34:53,160
Hodaka!

1656
01:34:54,106 --> 01:34:55,273
Just jump!

1657
01:35:06,658 --> 01:35:08,356
Hina, I found you.

1658
01:35:08,479 --> 01:35:10,416
Hodaka. Hodaka!

1659
01:35:10,495 --> 01:35:11,791
Don't let go of my hands.

1660
01:35:30,524 --> 01:35:31,524
Hina!

1661
01:35:32,407 --> 01:35:33,637
Hodaka!

1662
01:35:40,528 --> 01:35:41,855
Let's go home.

1663
01:35:42,882 --> 01:35:45,035
But if I do, the weather,

1664
01:35:45,084 --> 01:35:46,485
it-it will go back to...

1665
01:35:46,509 --> 01:35:47,069
Let it.

1666
01:35:47,139 --> 01:35:49,165
I don't care. You've done enough.

1667
01:35:49,276 --> 01:35:52,151
You don't have to be the sunshine girl anymore!

1668
01:36:05,103 --> 01:36:07,508
I don't care if I ever see the sun again.

1669
01:36:08,153 --> 01:36:11,503
I care about you. I don't care about blue skies.

1670
01:36:12,610 --> 01:36:13,983
It'll be okay.

1671
01:36:14,267 --> 01:36:16,135
Let the weather stay crazy.

1672
01:36:55,915 --> 01:36:57,355
Pray for yourself...

1673
01:36:59,309 --> 01:37:00,103
Hina.

1674
01:37:16,559 --> 01:37:17,360
Huh?

1675
01:37:22,372 --> 01:37:23,682
Hodaka.

1676
01:38:08,747 --> 01:38:10,892
The rain started falling again that day,

1677
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:13,339
and since then, it hasn't stopped.

1678
01:38:14,069 --> 01:38:17,428
Slowly, it sank Tokyo, where it remains,

1679
01:38:17,898 --> 01:38:19,230
submerged in water.

1680
01:38:19,718 --> 01:38:23,097
The rain's still falling three years later.

1681
01:38:38,276 --> 01:38:43,554
The garden where we've grown

1682
01:38:44,422 --> 01:38:47,525
When we look back

1683
01:38:47,639 --> 01:38:50,929
It went so fast

1684
01:38:50,991 --> 01:38:56,725
Now we must Say goodbye

1685
01:38:57,203 --> 01:38:59,610
We're leaving here

1686
01:38:59,745 --> 01:39:00,961
After all this...

1687
01:39:01,779 --> 01:39:03,447
 What's left for me to say?

1688
01:39:05,467 --> 01:39:07,928
Excuse me. Hodaka?

1689
01:39:09,906 --> 01:39:13,952
Uh, i-is it true that you're moving to Tokyo?

1690
01:39:13,987 --> 01:39:15,324
Uh, yeah.

1691
01:39:15,938 --> 01:39:17,345
Just ask him already.

1692
01:39:17,543 --> 01:39:18,870
It's your last chance.

1693
01:39:18,949 --> 01:39:19,608
Mm...

1694
01:39:19,719 --> 01:39:22,130
Wait a minute. Could this be...

1695
01:39:22,155 --> 01:39:24,295
Um, I just... I...

1696
01:39:24,551 --> 01:39:26,751
Well, there's something that
I've always wanted to ask you.

1697
01:39:26,776 --> 01:39:27,732
I don't believe it.

1698
01:39:27,857 --> 01:39:29,326
My first love confession?

1699
01:39:29,755 --> 01:39:31,677
Uh, Hodaka...

1700
01:39:32,086 --> 01:39:32,584
Huh?

1701
01:39:32,741 --> 01:39:33,638
I...

1702
01:39:34,045 --> 01:39:36,413
I heard you were wanted by the police in Tokyo.

1703
01:39:36,540 --> 01:39:37,460
Is it true?

1704
01:39:38,708 --> 01:39:39,264
Huh?

1705
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:44,388
That same summer,

1706
01:39:44,927 --> 01:39:46,049
three years ago,

1707
01:39:47,041 --> 01:39:48,630
I ended up getting arrested.

1708
01:39:49,774 --> 01:39:51,530
They charged me, and I stood trial.

1709
01:39:52,705 --> 01:39:55,439
I had to be on probation until I graduated high school.

1710
01:39:56,494 --> 01:39:59,323
The island, my parents' house, school...

1711
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,333
They were all the same old places where I spent my life.

1712
01:40:02,470 --> 01:40:05,052
But, actually, I was just biding my time,

1713
01:40:05,172 --> 01:40:06,840
waiting for graduation to come.

1714
01:40:08,874 --> 01:40:09,780
That day...

1715
01:40:11,644 --> 01:40:13,434
was the last time I saw Hina.

1716
01:40:14,807 --> 01:40:17,200
I have no idea what I'll think.

1717
01:40:19,226 --> 01:40:21,934
I haven't seen Tokyo since after it changed.

1718
01:40:23,061 --> 01:40:25,541
And I have no idea what I'll say to her.

1719
01:40:27,665 --> 01:40:30,638
Here's tomorrow's weather forecast for the Kanto region.

1720
01:40:31,008 --> 01:40:32,341
A full day of rain is predicted.

1721
01:40:32,365 --> 01:40:34,995
Now if I could just find a job.

1722
01:40:35,067 --> 01:40:38,480
Heavy rainfall in the mountain
regions. Lower, in the metropolitan areas,

1723
01:40:38,504 --> 01:40:42,291
there is a chance of the rain letting
up periodically throughout the day.

1724
01:40:42,918 --> 01:40:48,509
The high will be 59 degrees Fahrenheit, with the
same or slightly hotter temps in surrounding areas.

1725
01:40:49,303 --> 01:40:50,313
Oh, right.

1726
01:40:50,870 --> 01:40:52,243
Speaking of jobs...

1727
01:40:53,770 --> 01:40:56,105
Now for the forecast for the rest of the week.

1728
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:57,755
It looks like rain is expected every day.

1729
01:40:57,857 --> 01:40:58,821
The site's still up.

1730
01:41:05,604 --> 01:41:07,632
There was still one unanswered request.

1731
01:41:08,021 --> 01:41:09,395
It was from two years ago.

1732
01:41:09,586 --> 01:41:11,826
Next stop: Takashimadaira.

1733
01:41:11,993 --> 01:41:13,309
Takashimadaira.

1734
01:41:13,334 --> 01:41:16,068
Oh, it's you. Are you alone?

1735
01:41:16,346 --> 01:41:18,150
Where's your sunshine girl?

1736
01:41:18,229 --> 01:41:21,001
Oh, she's no longer a sunshine girl.

1737
01:41:21,429 --> 01:41:24,415
Actually, it's why I'm here... To tell you that.

1738
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:26,968
Uh, thanks, but I'm okay.

1739
01:41:27,817 --> 01:41:30,008
So, how long have you been living here?

1740
01:41:30,457 --> 01:41:32,633
Last time, weren't you in a house downtown somewhere?

1741
01:41:32,832 --> 01:41:33,966
I had to move.

1742
01:41:33,991 --> 01:41:36,192
The entire area is underwater now.

1743
01:41:36,462 --> 01:41:37,662
Sorry about that.

1744
01:41:37,799 --> 01:41:40,047
Why are you apologizing?

1745
01:41:44,781 --> 01:41:49,464
Did you know the entire area of
Tokyo used to be under the sea?

1746
01:41:50,052 --> 01:41:53,769
I think, until about 200 years ago.

1747
01:41:55,197 --> 01:41:56,883
Back when it was called Edo,

1748
01:41:57,082 --> 01:41:58,649
Tokyo was just a bay.

1749
01:41:59,155 --> 01:42:03,135
Little by little, humans... As well as
the weather... Changed this landscape.

1750
01:42:04,492 --> 01:42:05,709
Look at it now.

1751
01:42:05,962 --> 01:42:07,607
It's sort of reverted back,

1752
01:42:07,830 --> 01:42:09,816
back to its original self.

1753
01:42:11,620 --> 01:42:14,996
What is wrong with you? You've been thinking
about this crap for the last three years?

1754
01:42:15,530 --> 01:42:17,106
Hey, don't call it crap.

1755
01:42:17,130 --> 01:42:18,254
Stop acting like a kid.

1756
01:42:18,286 --> 01:42:20,716
You're about to start college.
You should focus on other things.

1757
01:42:20,764 --> 01:42:23,061
Yeah, but the two of us did something.

1758
01:42:23,172 --> 01:42:25,038
Did what? You think you caused this?

1759
01:42:25,063 --> 01:42:27,819
You really think you're
responsible for changing the world?

1760
01:42:30,291 --> 01:42:32,047
That's precisely why I called it crap.

1761
01:42:32,372 --> 01:42:34,000
You don't matter in the scheme of things.

1762
01:42:34,025 --> 01:42:35,543
Don't flatter yourself.

1763
01:42:35,646 --> 01:42:37,440
Oh. Check it out.

1764
01:42:37,551 --> 01:42:39,142
It's from my last date with my daughter.

1765
01:42:39,252 --> 01:42:41,963
Natsumi and Nagi were the third and fourth wheel, though.

1766
01:42:42,224 --> 01:42:47,180
Now, for crying out loud, will you stop
brooding over all this nonsense and just go see her?

1767
01:42:47,323 --> 01:42:48,770
I don't know why you haven't already.

1768
01:42:48,795 --> 01:42:52,614
I was on probation, so I wasn't supposed
to, and I didn't want to cause her any trouble.

1769
01:42:52,728 --> 01:42:55,430
Plus, even if I wanted to, she doesn't have a cell phone.

1770
01:42:55,533 --> 01:42:57,051
Also, I'm super nervous.

1771
01:42:57,162 --> 01:42:59,138
I don't even know what to say to her.

1772
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:05,938
Rain?

1773
01:43:06,543 --> 01:43:07,965
You've gotten so big.

1774
01:43:08,721 --> 01:43:11,929
Go on. Get out of here. Can't
you see I got work to do? Beat it.

1775
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:13,925
Go and find her. You know you want to.

1776
01:43:14,812 --> 01:43:16,062
Thank you for your time.

1777
01:43:16,150 --> 01:43:17,277
Nice to meet you.

1778
01:43:18,229 --> 01:43:18,697
Hey.

1779
01:43:18,927 --> 01:43:19,578
Huh?

1780
01:43:20,281 --> 01:43:23,107
Don't sweat the small stuff, big man.

1781
01:43:24,095 --> 01:43:25,476
The world is crazy.

1782
01:43:25,982 --> 01:43:28,351
It always has been, always will be.

1783
01:43:38,189 --> 01:43:39,817
The next stop is Hamamatsucho.

1784
01:43:39,852 --> 01:43:41,830
So where do you want to go to lunch?

1785
01:43:41,854 --> 01:43:43,498
You're always so incredibly positive.

1786
01:43:43,522 --> 01:43:44,525
You really think so?

1787
01:43:44,549 --> 01:43:45,267
The flowers should be

1788
01:43:45,291 --> 01:43:46,075
in full bloom.

1789
01:43:46,099 --> 01:43:46,919
That's what I hear.

1790
01:43:57,765 --> 01:44:00,545
Used to be under the sea.

1791
01:44:02,221 --> 01:44:03,595
The world's crazy.

1792
01:44:03,937 --> 01:44:05,877
Always has been, always will be.

1793
01:44:08,928 --> 01:44:13,003
So that means it's no one's fault that it's like this now.

1794
01:44:13,286 --> 01:44:14,925
Is this what I should say to her?

1795
01:44:15,885 --> 01:44:16,927
I don't know.

1796
01:44:48,835 --> 01:44:50,995
No. They're wrong.

1797
01:44:51,185 --> 01:44:54,650
That day, I... No, we changed the world.

1798
01:44:54,872 --> 01:44:56,060
I made a choice.

1799
01:44:56,255 --> 01:44:57,334
I chose her.

1800
01:44:57,572 --> 01:44:58,955
I chose this world,

1801
01:44:59,187 --> 01:45:01,252
and I choose to live in it!

1802
01:45:02,314 --> 01:45:03,506
Hina!

1803
01:45:09,214 --> 01:45:10,435
Hodaka!

1804
01:45:17,738 --> 01:45:19,417
Hodaka, what's wrong?

1805
01:45:19,771 --> 01:45:20,757
Are you okay?

1806
01:45:21,759 --> 01:45:22,545
Yeah.

1807
01:45:24,587 --> 01:45:25,594
Yeah, I'm fine.

1808
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:27,096
You know what, Hina?

1809
01:45:28,503 --> 01:45:29,981
We're gonna be all right.
