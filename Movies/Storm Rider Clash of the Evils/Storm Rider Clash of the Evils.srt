1
00:00:02,708 --> 00:00:07,500
(suspenseful music)

2
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:21,541
(heroic music)

3
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,625
- [Voiceover] Golden scales
can't be kept in a pond.

4
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:05,750
When Wind meets Cloud, the
golden fish becomes a dragon.

5
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,208
Conquerer, the leader of the world's

6
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:09,875
best martial arts school,
The Conquerer's Clan,

7
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:12,166
tries to bring the martial
arts world together

8
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,000
with Mud Buddha's words on his mind.

9
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,791
If he could get Wind and Cloud together,

10
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,125
he could unite everyone under his rule.

11
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,708
Acting on his wild ambition,

12
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,750
Conquerer kills Wind and Cloud's families

13
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,208
and adopts them himself,
teaching them in the arts.

14
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:27,125
But, the hearts of the young
Wind and Cloud reap revenge

15
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,666
and while they study under Conquerer,

16
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,250
they await the chance to kill him.

17
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:36,333
(suspenseful music)

18
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,583
- [Wind] Conquerer taught
us all the kung fu we know.

19
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,458
So to beat him, we'll need
the Flame Kylin's blood

20
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,583
to gain power.

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,458
- [Cloud] But, you could be possessed.

22
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,375
No, Wind, it's too risky.

23
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:59,250
(ominous music)

24
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
- [Voiceover] So, Wind,
you better prepare yourself

25
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,375
and be ready to sacrifice your life.

26
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,875
I drew all the devilish
Flame Kylin's blood.

27
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,750
You'll need to use your
ice heart technique

28
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,916
or else you'll lose your mind

29
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:47,666
and become possessed by an
uncontrollable killing machine.

30
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,791
- [Cloud] Wind, don't.

31
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,041
- [Voiceover] You can't stop this.

32
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,041
You and Wind are the only two people

33
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,291
who can fuse with the Flame Kylin's blood.

34
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,083
To call upon its power, you must allow

35
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,208
yourself to be possessed
by the Flame Kylin.

36
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,083
(tearing)

37
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,833
(dripping)

38
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,708
(shouting)

39
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,500
(chirping)

40
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,125
Now, Cloud, remember
this, Wind's devil blood

41
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,750
and your own is connected.

42
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,333
When Wind is using the powers granted

43
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,458
by the Kylin's blood, you must cease.

44
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,875
If not, he'll lose control.

45
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,500
- [Cloud] No, Wind.

46
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,208
(chirping)

47
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,541
(shouting)

48
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,500
- [Wind] Listen, Cloud,
if I ever lose control

49
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,166
of the demon please kill me.

50
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,791
- [Cloud] Conquerer, it's time you've paid

51
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,375
for all you've done.

52
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,875
- [Conquerer] Wind and Cloud
will make and break me?

53
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:36,958
Ridiculous.

54
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:37,791
(shouting)

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,291
(exploding)

56
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:46,833
(fighting)

57
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:18,375
(thrilling music)

58
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,583
(shouting)

59
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,458
- [Cloud] Quickly, Wind,
the ice heart technique.

60
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,666
- [Wind] The heart is cold as ice.

61
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,583
Nothing can stand in my way.

62
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:41,875
With a heart as clear as ice,
nothing can stand in my way.

63
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:47,166
(breaking)

64
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:51,541
(shouting)

65
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,416
Listen, Cloud, if I ever lose control

66
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,250
of the demon, please kill me.

67
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,291
(clanking)

68
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,416
(rumbling)

69
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,416
(shouting)

70
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:19,333
(fighting)

71
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:39,541
(running)

72
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:56,541
(fighting)

73
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,125
(shouting)

74
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:13,125
(fighting)

75
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,083
- [Conquerer] Run with me.

76
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,125
- [Wind] I'll go with you.

77
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:30,000
(apprehensive music)

78
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,875
(shouting)

79
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,125
- [Voiceover] Stormriders.

80
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,458
Clash of evils.

81
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:19,166
(drumming)

82
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:28,500
(foreboding music)

83
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:42,833
- Archers!

84
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,375
(crashing)

85
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,250
Fire.

86
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,291
(shouting)

87
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,791
(crumbling)

88
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:36,416
(suspenseful music)

89
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:40,833
- Jue.

90
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,625
You dreamt about your revenge again?

91
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,083
Wait, Jue.

92
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,916
We can't, Jue.

93
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,291
I promised our master.

94
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,791
- [Voiceover] Master Jue,
there's a man outside

95
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:57,666
called Duen Long.

96
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,958
He's got a letter for you.

97
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:07,708
- I wanna see him.

98
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,291
- Come with me.

99
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,916
- Long, isn't this the famous House of Ao,

100
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,375
from the Sword Worship Villa?

101
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,291
Why are they hiding underground now?

102
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,791
- The clan from Sword Worship Villa

103
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,750
was the Emperor's appointed swordsmiths

104
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,416
but due to false charges of rebellion,

105
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,583
the Emperor had the whole clan executed.

106
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:38,625
There are only two survivors
from that massacre.

107
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,083
Jue and Kay are the only
remaining members of that clan.

108
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,333
To survive, they went underground.

109
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:48,041
(banging and clanking)

110
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:12,208
I'm Duen Long, I'm here to see Master Ao.

111
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,541
I see from your forge that
your clan's swordsmith's skills

112
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,791
are not exaggerated.

113
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,333
They remind me of Sword
Worship Villa's glory days.

114
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,958
- Please get to the point, sir.

115
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,041
- I heard you've been searching for

116
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,541
the Flame Kylin's blood.

117
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,500
If that's true, I come bearing good news.

118
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,666
- The Flame Kylin's
been extinct for years.

119
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,958
So how can there be any Flame Kylin blood?

120
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,416
- There are only two people in this world

121
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:33,791
that carry the beast's blood.

122
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,708
The Linien Cave, the Flame Kylin.

123
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,541
The stories say that
one day Wind and Cloud

124
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,791
entered the cave, fought
with the Flame Kylin.

125
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,500
They killed him and took its blood.

126
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,875
- Why should we believe you?

127
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,666
- Because the Duen family and
the Flame Kylin are linked.

128
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,583
- The Kylin Sword.

129
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,333
- If you want the blood
from Wind and Cloud,

130
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,708
you'll need the Duen's family Kylin Sword.

131
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:22,708
- And, what do you want?

132
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,958
- What I want is the Conquerer's Clan.

133
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,041
- How dare you, Quail, you can't go

134
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,416
through Mr. Chao's things.

135
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,375
- Please, everyone has to
follow the rules and cooperate.

136
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,166
- What rules?

137
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,958
If anything breaks, can you compensate us?

138
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,500
- Oh, no, no, no,no, no, I can't.

139
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,208
- Where's your self-respect?

140
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,083
You're a guardsman.

141
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,375
So, what's this expensive thing, huh?

142
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,541
Let me take a look.

143
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,208
(elephant roaring)

144
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,916
There's a whole circus there.

145
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:06,875
What's going on?

146
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,625
Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Chao, I hope you're well.

147
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,375
- Oh, come on, Captain, it's my husband's

148
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,666
50th birthday today,
so we've hired a circus

149
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,208
for the big occasion
and everyone's invited.

150
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,291
You don't really need
to search them, do you?

151
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,333
- Thing is, we've received
news that the Bat Gang

152
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,916
is gonna ambush the city.

153
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,791
- The Bat Gang coming here to attack us?

154
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,208
We should go hire some
bodyguards to protect us.

155
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,625
- Don't worry, with me
here, it's more than enough

156
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,083
to take on the Bat Gang.

157
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,000
- Okay then, leave all the knives

158
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,041
and swords and weapons here.

159
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,375
- Stay vigilant everyone.

160
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:53,916
(people talking)

161
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:58,833
(exciting music)

162
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,583
- Hey mom, look, it's the elephant.

163
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:22,791
- Excuse me, sir, get out of the way.

164
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,916
(barking)

165
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,750
- [Mrs. Chao] Quickly
men, get my dog back.

166
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,000
- [Men] Yes, ma'am.

167
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,208
- Quickly, there he is.

168
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,708
(funky music)

169
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:50,583
- Give that back.

170
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,416
- Hey, doggie, come back.

171
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,750
- Hurry, I saw the dog go that way.

172
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,125
Go, go!

173
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,708
- Well, maybe, I should help her out.

174
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,375
- Ay, watch out.

175
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,541
- Wait, give me back my money.

176
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:04,416
- Come on, this way.

177
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,375
(giggling)

178
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,250
- Captain, there's no
trace of anyone there.

179
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,416
- They must've gone the other way.

180
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,958
Hurry up, after them, come on.

181
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:23,875
- [Men] Yes, sir.

182
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,083
- You pervert.

183
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,166
- That's the first sign of her love.

184
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,416
- Didn't I tell you to work
harder on your kung fu?

185
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,541
If I'm not there, who'll
save your butts next time?

186
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,916
- Hey, Mrs. Chao really
seems to care about that dog.

187
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,125
It must be worth a lot.

188
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,875
- Well, the dog's mine now
so don't even think about it.

189
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,333
- Hey, Ying, you're not going to try

190
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,333
and sell my little doggie, are you, huh?

191
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,333
- Well, that depends on
if he's a good boy or not.

192
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,375
Hey, what are you barking at, huh?

193
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,291
Keep barking and I'll sell you, you hear?

194
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,083
Oh no, now I'm all wet.

195
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,041
- Oh no, doggie.

196
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,000
Hey, doggie.

197
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,208
- [Ying] Hey, Yam, come on.

198
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,166
Forget about that mutt.

199
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,500
Come back.

200
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,375
- Doggie.

201
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,000
(barking)

202
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,125
Doggie, where have you gone now?

203
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,208
(barking)

204
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:37,000
(whimpering)

205
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,041
(barking)

206
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,625
- Come on, Yam.

207
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:46,125
Forget about him.

208
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,541
Come back out, please.

209
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,208
- Doggie, what are you growling at now?

210
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,791
(growling)

211
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,000
(barking)

212
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,625
(yelling)

213
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,041
- Get out of here quickly.

214
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,875
- Come on, Yam, we gotta help.

215
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,625
Leave that guy, he's
probably dead already.

216
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:17,291
- He's still breathing.

217
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,333
We've gotta help.

218
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,375
- Right, don't move.

219
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,416
- Get outta here.

220
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,750
(roaring)

221
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,333
Okay, hold him still.

222
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,250
(yelling)

223
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,250
Yam, hurry up with that.

224
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,083
- You know, Ying, he could be abandoned.

225
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,791
- Let's talk about that when he wakes up.

226
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,583
(grunting)

227
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,291
- Hey, look at this.

228
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,541
Who's arm do you think is
bigger, his or mine, huh?

229
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:12,875
Yeah?

230
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,041
- Wow.

231
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:14,625
Check that out.

232
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,375
His arm's as big as your head, Juno.

233
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:25,541
(suspenseful music)

234
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:47,916
(somber music)

235
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:03,000
- Cloud, I promise I'll find you.

236
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:57,833
(shouting)

237
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,041
(roaring)

238
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,833
You dodge me.

239
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:04,625
(shouting)

240
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:31,000
(somber music)

241
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,791
- Hello, sir, is there
something I can help you with?

242
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,833
- Where are your best grave stones?

243
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,500
- This way, sir, follow me.

244
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,208
This is Ku Young white marble.

245
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,208
It's top grade.

246
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,125
- This will be fine.

247
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,250
- And, what should I
engrave on the headstone?

248
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,375
- The grave of Brother Cloud.

249
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,291
- [Voiceover] As you wish.

250
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,458
- This headstone is the last thing

251
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,833
I can do for my good brother.

252
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,750
Make sure you do the best job you can.

253
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,375
- [Voiceover] Table for one.

254
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,416
Please, come right this way.

255
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:45,666
- He's got a sword!

256
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,583
- [Voiceover] This guy's
disrespecting Captain Xi.

257
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:56,750
- [Captain Xi] Where's
the man with the sword?

258
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,916
- [Voiceover] Upstairs, Captain.

259
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,541
- Hey, you with the long hair,

260
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:02,958
I've not seen you around before.

261
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,125
Where did you come from?

262
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,583
- Are you deaf, boy, Captain Xi's

263
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,500
asking you how you got in the city.

264
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,291
- From the South.

265
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,666
- You think I'm some kind of idiot?

266
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:12,041
The South is nothing
but cliffs and ravines.

267
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,541
- Yeah, that's true but
that's where I came from.

268
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,541
- I don't care if you
were born from the rocks.

269
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:17,750
You can't bring weapons in here.

270
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,791
I'm taking it.

271
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,500
(gasping)

272
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,416
(struggling)

273
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:41,541
Please, sir, there's a weapons ban

274
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:43,041
being enforced on the city.

275
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:45,416
Nobody's allowed weapons
within the city walls.

276
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:47,750
Knives and swords could hurt good people.

277
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,458
We don't want people to get hurt.

278
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:52,083
- Blades ruin lives but so does revenge.

279
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,208
- We're just following orders

280
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,833
and keeping your sword temporarily, sir.

281
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,833
Oh man, that long haired guy's good.

282
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,166
I wonder where he's from.

283
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:01,500
And you, you idiot, you
almost chopped my arm off.

284
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,291
- [Quail] Sorry, Captain,
that was an accident.

285
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:12,166
(foreboding music)

286
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:14,083
- [Voiceover] What's Wind doing here?

287
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:15,125
He's so drunk.

288
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:16,666
- [Voiceover] I don't care.

289
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:19,750
Anyone from Conquerer's
Clan needs to be dealt with.

290
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,625
- [Voiceover] The master's coming.

291
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:28,708
(mysterious music)

292
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:40,750
- [Men] Mistress.

293
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,000
- Miss Dream, he's the
renowned Whispering Wind

294
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,291
from the Conquerer's Clan.

295
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:51,000
Should he awaken, we will
not be his equal in battle.

296
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,791
We should kill him before he wakes up.

297
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:58,083
(monkey chattering)

298
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:00,375
- I want to know exactly why he's here.

299
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:01,708
Quickly, bring him inside.

300
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:05,000
- We're only hiding here because

301
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,041
we're trying to escape
from the Conquerer's Clan.

302
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,750
His presence might expose us.

303
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:11,833
- No, you're wrong.

304
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,458
We're only hiding her because we want

305
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,958
to get away from senseless violence.

306
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:17,791
Just tell everyone to stay alert.

307
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,916
(thunder booming)

308
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,125
- Friends of the martial arts world,

309
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:34,083
members of the Conquerer's Clan,

310
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:37,416
in defending the clan, our
Lord Conquerer perished,

311
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:40,000
killed by his own
disciples, Whispering Wind

312
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,750
and Striding Cloud, the
whole of Conquerer's Clan

313
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,583
is sad and mournful now.

314
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:48,875
Our kingdom needs his
king and ours is gone.

315
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:50,875
Today, we shall announce that Tun Wong

316
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:53,083
will ascend to the
position of clan leader.

317
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,375
- Huh, Tun Wong as clan leader?

318
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,166
(laughing)

319
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:01,541
- [Duen Long] You're all right.

320
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:05,666
So, why don't you let
me be your new leader?

321
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:08,208
(whispering)

322
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:10,458
- What are you doing here?

323
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,625
You were thrown out of
the Conquerer's Clan.

324
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:13,208
- How rude.

325
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:14,333
I'm your new leader.

326
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:16,125
How dare you speak to me like that.

327
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,750
I'll make an example of you.

328
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,541
- You don't have the skills, boy.

329
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:34,500
(yelling)

330
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:42,666
- Oh, you deserve that.

331
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,083
You should've just let him be.

332
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:49,500
(clanking)

333
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:57,833
- This is why you have no
idea how to treat a lady.

334
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:01,083
We don't often get such
a beautiful girl around.

335
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:11,333
(whinnying)

336
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:15,583
(wind howling)

337
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:24,000
(birds cawing)

338
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:34,166
(mysterious music)

339
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:52,125
- Hmm, Conquerer, you
always did look down on me.

340
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:54,791
But, you still met your end at
the hands of your disciples.

341
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:58,833
Well now, have a good look at
who's succeeded your place.

342
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:01,208
It's me, Duen Long.

343
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:07,083
(bird cawing)

344
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:11,166
(wind blowing)

345
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:16,958
(suspenseful music)

346
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:57,625
(birds chirping)

347
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:05,250
(clinking)

348
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:09,333
- [Voiceover] A fish in a boiling cauldron

349
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:10,958
knows its days are numbered.

350
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:12,375
Why would the bird who knows the nest

351
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:14,083
is dangerous wait for the wind?

352
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:18,166
- I never knew Conquerer's
Clan had such a poetic master.

353
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:19,000
You are?

354
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,291
- Names are useless, hence, I am Nameless.

355
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:23,791
- Ao Jue, honored to meet you.

356
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:26,541
- Ao Jue?

357
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:29,458
So, you're from the Sword Worship Villa?

358
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:36,291
Well, Jue, it seems you
haven't caught any fish today.

359
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:40,750
- I've only caught small
ones but I want big game.

360
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,500
- If you're looking for big
game, you should be weary,

361
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,750
another bloody storm
could erupt at any moment.

362
00:28:46,916 --> 00:28:49,791
A storm such as this could be devastating.

363
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:51,541
- Master Nameless, you worry too much.

364
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:52,916
Look, the sky is clear.

365
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:55,833
The big fish is here.

366
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:05,458
- Once the big fish leaves,

367
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:07,208
other fish can loose their bearings

368
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:08,916
and things will turn to chaos.

369
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,875
- The weak are nothing
but prey for the strong.

370
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:14,291
This is simply nature.

371
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And, definitely me.

372
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:23,208
- Violence is in human nature
but it disrupts the peace.

373
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:27,083
(exploding)

374
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:45,666
(shouting)

375
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:57,750
(somber music)

376
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,833
Didn't Sword Worship
Villa make their weapons

377
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:01,166
to uphold justice?

378
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:04,250
- Justice, righteousness and
evil are all scholarly lies.

379
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,958
Sword Worship Villa pledged
their loyalty to the Emperor,

380
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:09,458
yet, why did he do what he
did and slaughter my family?

381
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,250
The Sword Worship Villa of old is gone.

382
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,416
They were eliminated.

383
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:18,125
My new clan is the Blade Manor.

384
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:20,333
- Hate is the foundation of all evil.

385
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:22,750
Young Master Jue, why
can't you leave behind

386
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,458
that hate and live a life worth living?

387
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:28,125
(clinking)

388
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:35,375
- My nature is so merciless,
I have to be cold, too.

389
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,208
Not everyone appreciates my music.

390
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:44,875
(epic music)

391
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:04,083
Ah, the Sword Shadow Technique.

392
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,833
- [Nameless] This stubbornness
will do you no good.

393
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:18,000
Let go of your anger.

394
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,083
(crashing)

395
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:27,500
- No one in the world can stop me.

396
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:37,208
- Hey, Ying, the Chao
Family's bodyguards are here.

397
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:43,166
- I'll go deal with them.

398
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:44,500
- Wait, Wood, stay calm.

399
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:48,708
- You got nowhere to run now.

400
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:50,791
Brat's pretty brave.

401
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:52,666
How dare you steal Mr. Chao's dog.

402
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,250
(thumping)

403
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:07,041
(barking)

404
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:15,708
- There's a martial arts master in there!

405
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:16,625
Run!

406
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,666
- Wow, Ying, he's good at martial arts.

407
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:27,083
- So, what's your name?

408
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:33,708
- I don't remember.

409
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:35,291
- You don't remember your own name?

410
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:40,250
- It doesn't matter if you don't know.

411
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,625
You can work for me, now.

412
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:42,458
- You're the youngest here.

413
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:43,833
Why should he work for you?

414
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:48,083
- What about now?

415
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:49,916
- [Ying] Well, you're gonna need a name.

416
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:51,625
Seeing as you're so good at martial arts,

417
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:52,750
we'll call you Expert.

418
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,083
You're one of us now, okay?

419
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:55,708
- [Yang] Yeah, Expert's a great name.

420
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:57,916
- [Voiceover] Mr. Chao is looking for

421
00:33:57,916 --> 00:33:59,666
some great bodyguards today.

422
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:02,208
He'll choose the winner of
these martial arts contests.

423
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:11,708
(fighting)

424
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,791
We have a winner.

425
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:22,083
It's Chen Dong of the Chen Fist Clan.

426
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:23,125
Next fighter.

427
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,708
- Are they hiring bodyguards?

428
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:30,583
- Is that wine?

429
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:32,083
Is it the Drunken Fist?

430
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:33,791
- But, we've already
chosen eight bodyguards,

431
00:34:33,791 --> 00:34:34,458
we don't need you.

432
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:35,333
Move along.

433
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,791
- Well, I'll take all eight of 'em on.

434
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:41,041
- [Voiceover] How dare he?

435
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:41,625
- [Voiceover] Rat.

436
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,666
- Let's get him.

437
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:51,333
(fighting)

438
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:53,750
(exploding)

439
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:06,583
(exploding)

440
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:14,000
- Whoa, great!

441
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,083
He'll do for me.

442
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:16,125
- The Wind Kick.

443
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:18,041
- That means he's Wind.

444
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:19,750
We should go tell the boss right away.

445
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:23,500
- [Voiceover] Here's the money I owe you.

446
00:35:29,583 --> 00:35:31,500
- Mistress wants him
alive, what should we do?

447
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,708
- Kill him first, we'll worry later.

448
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:35,958
- But, the Mistress
won't look kindly on us.

449
00:35:35,958 --> 00:35:38,125
- Well, let's prepare some poison first.

450
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:40,083
I'll convince Miss Dream it's for the best

451
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:41,625
after we've killed him.

452
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,458
(crickets chirping)

453
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:51,416
(somber music)

454
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:15,250
(glass breaking)

455
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:29,458
(thrilling music)

456
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:33,416
- Stop.

457
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,166
Look at that.

458
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:38,125
It was he and Cloud who killed Conquerer.

459
00:36:40,916 --> 00:36:42,666
You almost killed a good man.

460
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,416
(fire burning)

461
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:53,541
(wind blowing)

462
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:57,333
(horse whinnying)

463
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:07,458
(crickets chirping)

464
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,875
(horse whinnying)

465
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:11,833
(owl hooting)

466
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,000
- [Duen Long] Ghost Healer, stop now.

467
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:27,333
(chuckling)

468
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:28,208
- Long.

469
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,791
(ominous music)

470
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:33,916
- That smell.

471
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:35,458
She smells so delicious.

472
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:36,500
She's a woman?

473
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,916
Well, what a waste.

474
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,750
(horse whinnying)

475
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:43,791
- So, where is it?

476
00:37:54,958 --> 00:37:56,375
(chuckling)

477
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:00,333
- This toxic leech can
poison any human blood.

478
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:01,708
This poison will work within a day

479
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:03,625
of entering your victim's body.

480
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:05,625
No matter how good his
martial arts powers,

481
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:07,583
he'll still become fatally poisoned.

482
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:09,875
He'll lose his strength
and won't be able to fight.

483
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:13,583
- Ah, you're just as good as they say.

484
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,333
If you need anything, let me know.

485
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:18,916
- Another mild horse.

486
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:20,666
- He's yours.

487
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:24,375
I didn't tell you because
I didn't want to scare you.

488
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:26,958
- But Long, can you really trust this guy?

489
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:28,416
- [Duen Long] The Ghost
Healer's about as crazy

490
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:30,250
as they come but as long as you give him

491
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:33,208
what he wants, he'd even
betray his own parents.

492
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:35,500
(growling)

493
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,750
- You want to turn the Flame
Kylin's blood into poison

494
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,041
with these leeches so
it'll destroy Jue after

495
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:42,208
he extracts it from Wind
and Cloud and drinks it?

496
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:45,500
- It's a necessary step to
kill two birds with one stone.

497
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:50,208
- Hey, Expert, come here.

498
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,375
What are you waiting for?

499
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,416
You'll have to earn your keep here.

500
00:38:57,416 --> 00:38:58,750
So, let me show you how we do it.

501
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,708
(funky music)

502
00:39:01,708 --> 00:39:03,125
- Excuse me, coming through.
- [Wood] There's so many

503
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:04,666
people, hey, excuse me.

504
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:10,750
(laughing)

505
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,541
- Ow, that hurt, why you hitting me?

506
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:14,958
- You're so useless.

507
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:16,666
Watch me.

508
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:22,291
- Let's see you do it.

509
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:34,416
- I give up.

510
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:36,625
How can you still see while
you're still blindfolded?

511
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,583
(laughing)

512
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:43,041
- So, you think you're good, huh?

513
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:44,416
Try and steal my money bag.

514
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,875
Come on.

515
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:52,208
(wind blowing)

516
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:54,875
(jingling)

517
00:39:58,666 --> 00:39:59,625
You pervert.

518
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,000
- [Juno] Don't do it.

519
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,208
- [Yam] Stop it, Expert.

520
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:22,083
(calm music)

521
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:24,541
(jingling)

522
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:30,333
- Hey, Expert, as I saved your life,

523
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:31,583
you owe me a big favor.

524
00:40:31,583 --> 00:40:33,583
- Sure, tell me what you want me to do.

525
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:41,125
- We're here.

526
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:42,583
Let's go get the doggie.

527
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:55,750
Cool, that was so much fun.

528
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,208
(clanking)

529
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,333
- Shhh.

530
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:08,000
(suspenseful music)

531
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,083
- Okay, you guys, go look for the dog.

532
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:10,708
- Right.

533
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:13,583
- Be careful though.

534
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:14,958
You come with me, Expert.

535
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:21,166
(suspenseful music)

536
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:30,041
(creaking)

537
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:36,541
(gong ringing)

538
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:42,791
(struggling)

539
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:43,666
- [Expert] Let me do it.

540
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:50,041
(smashing)

541
00:41:53,916 --> 00:41:57,416
(crumbling)

542
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:02,458
- Look at all that gold.

543
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:20,208
You know what, all this
stuff is dirty treasure.

544
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:20,875
- Dirty treasure?

545
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:21,916
- Let's take it all.

546
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:27,666
(fire burning)

547
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:29,250
Expert, be careful.

548
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:43,958
(rumbling)

549
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:10,583
(screaming)

550
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:15,041
(screaming)

551
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:18,000
(water splashing)

552
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:25,958
(banging)

553
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:34,416
(banging)

554
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,875
Are you okay?

555
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:05,458
- What a coincidence.

556
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,333
Take them away.

557
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,125
- Captain Xi.

558
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,791
This has nothing to do with the kids.

559
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,291
Let them go.

560
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:22,166
- Look, Miss, we caught the
thieves red-handed this time.

561
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:27,958
But, I guess, as it's your first offense,

562
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:29,791
you were all coerced.

563
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:31,041
You may all leave.

564
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:33,500
But, you stay right here.

565
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:35,750
- Wait, what do you want with him?

566
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:39,083
- Well, that's men's business,

567
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:40,625
woman should keep their noses out.

568
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:43,416
I've never seen you before.

569
00:44:43,416 --> 00:44:44,875
So, tell me, where are you from?

570
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:46,833
- The South.

571
00:44:46,833 --> 00:44:48,750
- Huh, the South, again.

572
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:51,583
That big tattoo means
you're in a gang, right?

573
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:55,375
Resisting arrest?

574
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,833
- Oh, he's still breathing.

575
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:06,250
- Why is everyone from
the South so darn strong?

576
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:15,500
(ominous music)

577
00:45:40,875 --> 00:45:42,000
- [Young Jue] Father, why are we called

578
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,750
the Sword Worship Villa?

579
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:46,208
- A long time ago, our
great ancestors came

580
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:48,291
across a piece of superior metal.

581
00:45:48,291 --> 00:45:49,625
They wanted to use it to create

582
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:51,916
a completely invincible sword which they

583
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,666
would call Jue.

584
00:45:53,666 --> 00:45:54,875
But, it was cursed.

585
00:45:54,875 --> 00:45:56,333
Whoever tried to forge this sword

586
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:58,416
would die a sudden and violent death.

587
00:45:58,416 --> 00:46:00,708
The sword's spirit was
uncontrollably fierce.

588
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:03,291
- But, isn't a fierce sword a good sword?

589
00:46:03,291 --> 00:46:05,208
- True but a man should
never be controlled

590
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:09,625
by the sword he uses or he
will lose all his humanity.

591
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:11,500
- Of course, Father.

592
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,666
- Our ancestors considered
the evil of the sword

593
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:16,791
was too great so they buried
it inside a stone cavern

594
00:46:16,791 --> 00:46:19,250
before any more trouble
could be brought upon them.

595
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:21,000
They decreed that none
of their descendants

596
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,125
should learn how to use it and each year

597
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:26,083
they made sure to worship the
sword to protect the family.

598
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:37,500
- [Voiceover] Master, the Emperor says

599
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,541
Sword Worship Villa was
planning a rebellion.

600
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:40,750
The army's here already.

601
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:45,875
- I should never have
worked for the Emperor.

602
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:47,041
(shouting)

603
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:50,833
- Master, Master.

604
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:52,125
- Kay, I don't have much time.

605
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:53,458
I know Jue loves you.

606
00:46:54,583 --> 00:46:57,291
But, your martial arts is
derived from a negative power

607
00:46:57,291 --> 00:47:00,250
while Jue's skills are derived
from a positive energy.

608
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:05,166
For the sake of Jue, promise
me you'll never marry him.

609
00:47:05,166 --> 00:47:06,833
Now hurry and get him outta here.

610
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:11,625
Get outta here.

611
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:26,875
- Master.

612
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,125
- Father.

613
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:33,083
I know where I can find
the Flame Kylin's blood

614
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:35,041
to awaken the Sword Jue.

615
00:47:35,041 --> 00:47:37,083
And soon, I'll get revenge.

616
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:43,250
(somber music)

617
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:49,666
You killed my father.

618
00:47:50,708 --> 00:47:52,541
You destroyed my home

619
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:55,041
and you even desecrate
the land of my ancestors?

620
00:47:55,041 --> 00:47:56,708
You despicable emperor.

621
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:58,833
(epic music)

622
00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:00,041
(yelling)

623
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,208
(rumbling)

624
00:48:56,208 --> 00:49:00,583
(struggling)

625
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:17,791
It truly is an evil sword.

626
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:18,916
Just what I need.

627
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:32,416
(exploding)

628
00:49:35,541 --> 00:49:37,791
(thunder booming)

629
00:49:38,791 --> 00:49:40,333
- From the Conquerer's Clan.

630
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:42,291
If we let him stay here,
it'll just bring us trouble.

631
00:49:42,291 --> 00:49:44,166
- But he killed Conquerer.

632
00:49:44,166 --> 00:49:46,208
That severs any ties he had with the clan.

633
00:49:47,291 --> 00:49:50,625
- Mistress, can you really
bet all our lives on it?

634
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:53,041
(thunder booming)

635
00:49:53,041 --> 00:49:55,833
- What I'm about to do isn't
anything personal, Wind.

636
00:49:55,833 --> 00:49:57,708
We're trying to avoid any trouble here.

637
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:01,041
(fighting)

638
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:02,125
(glass breaking)

639
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,666
- Master Wind, please, spare his life.

640
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,166
(monkey chattering)

641
00:50:25,166 --> 00:50:26,166
That fire monkey.

642
00:50:28,583 --> 00:50:29,958
- Mud Buddha?

643
00:50:29,958 --> 00:50:31,291
- Ah, this is fate.

644
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,666
Master Wind, it seems fate has
brought us together, again.

645
00:50:40,208 --> 00:50:42,083
(thunder booming)

646
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:46,791
(elephant roaring)

647
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:52,541
(festive music)

648
00:50:58,083 --> 00:50:58,916
- Great!

649
00:51:08,583 --> 00:51:09,000
- Excuse me.

650
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,250
Excuse me, please.

651
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:11,083
Excuse me.

652
00:51:18,791 --> 00:51:20,291
- Expert, come with me.

653
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:31,958
After what we've been through,

654
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:33,375
I guess I can trust you.

655
00:51:33,375 --> 00:51:36,125
This is all the money we've
managed to save so far.

656
00:51:36,125 --> 00:51:37,291
- What are you going to do with it?

657
00:51:39,916 --> 00:51:41,833
- All of us are orphans.

658
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:43,625
And, nobody's looking out for us.

659
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:46,041
So, in order to survive, we have to steal.

660
00:51:47,916 --> 00:51:48,750
I hope

661
00:51:50,958 --> 00:51:54,083
Wood, Bymie, Juno and Yam live good lives.

662
00:51:54,083 --> 00:51:57,791
I heard once, if you keep
heading towards the East,

663
00:51:57,791 --> 00:52:00,708
you'll get to the sea and if you continue

664
00:52:00,708 --> 00:52:04,666
traveling East by boat, after
a month you'll find an island.

665
00:52:05,666 --> 00:52:07,583
The beautiful Peng Li Isle.

666
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:10,916
When I've saved enough money,

667
00:52:10,916 --> 00:52:13,416
I'm going to take those
kids and go to that island.

668
00:52:17,166 --> 00:52:19,375
(owl hooting)

669
00:52:26,875 --> 00:52:31,541
(fighting)

670
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:37,833
(creaking)

671
00:52:37,833 --> 00:52:39,833
(horse whinnying)

672
00:52:44,625 --> 00:52:45,875
- [Men] Master.

673
00:52:47,416 --> 00:52:49,750
- Are you certain Wind is in the city?

674
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,416
- Yes, he's at the winery.

675
00:52:52,291 --> 00:52:53,666
- I'm dying to meet him.

676
00:52:53,666 --> 00:52:55,500
The rest of you go to Chao's mansion.

677
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,166
Go!

678
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:12,166
(crickets chirping)

679
00:53:12,166 --> 00:53:13,166
(horse snorting)

680
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:31,500
- No, don't open the door.

681
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:38,625
(suspenseful music)

682
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:06,875
Oh, Evil Fang.

683
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,708
- So, Wind, do you remember this scar

684
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:15,666
you gave me 10 years ago?

685
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:17,416
I'm gonna give it back to you tenfold.

686
00:54:19,541 --> 00:54:24,416
(fighting)

687
00:54:30,875 --> 00:54:32,458
(horse neighing)

688
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:41,916
(crashing)

689
00:54:41,916 --> 00:54:46,208
(fighting) 54 42

690
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:51,833
- Someone help us!

691
00:54:56,291 --> 00:54:57,291
(yelling)

692
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:25,208
- Take everything with us, men!

693
00:55:27,875 --> 00:55:28,750
(horse snorting)

694
00:55:30,625 --> 00:55:32,708
- This is our chance, we
should get some as well.

695
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:35,958
- Please, I beg you, leave me and my wife

696
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:37,125
enough to retire.

697
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,750
- Well, I would.

698
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:41,833
But, you won't live another day

699
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:43,708
so you won't need retirement money.

700
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:48,583
- Actually, take it all, I don't mind.

701
00:55:48,583 --> 00:55:49,458
Just don't kill us.

702
00:55:49,458 --> 00:55:50,708
Please help!

703
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:54,333
- Let's go save 'em.

704
00:55:55,958 --> 00:56:00,916
(suspenseful music)

705
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,833
(fighting)

706
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:12,583
(fighting)

707
00:57:38,541 --> 00:57:39,416
- Stay still.

708
00:57:46,541 --> 00:57:51,541
(fighting)

709
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,250
- Miss Dream, are you okay?

710
00:58:16,833 --> 00:58:21,666
(fighting)

711
00:58:27,291 --> 00:58:32,291
(crumbling)

712
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:42,583
(fighting)

713
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:06,666
(banging)

714
00:59:17,833 --> 00:59:22,708
(fighting) 59 18

715
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:53,208
- It's Striding Cloud!

716
00:59:53,208 --> 00:59:54,625
- Wind!

717
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:58,833
(yelling)

718
00:59:58,833 --> 01:00:00,708
(water splashing)

719
01:00:07,333 --> 01:00:09,875
(growling)

720
01:00:10,875 --> 01:00:11,708
- What the?

721
01:00:18,333 --> 01:00:21,000
(squishing)

722
01:00:22,208 --> 01:00:23,458
(gasping)

723
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:29,791
(water splashing)

724
01:00:54,625 --> 01:00:58,416
(shouting)

725
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,333
- Good sir, thank you for
helping us last night.

726
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:31,791
If not for you, our whole
city would've been wiped out.

727
01:01:33,541 --> 01:01:34,333
- [Voiceover] Thank you.

728
01:01:35,583 --> 01:01:36,833
- Well sir, I've discussed this with

729
01:01:36,833 --> 01:01:38,875
the Elder Council of the
City and we would like you

730
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:41,125
to be the captain of our
guard and protect us.

731
01:01:42,583 --> 01:01:45,750
- Captain, so that means
he'll have to arrest us?

732
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:48,166
- [Yam] But, he still works
for me so he can't arrest us.

733
01:01:50,541 --> 01:01:55,500
(somber music)

734
01:01:59,208 --> 01:02:00,791
- What we witnessed just now,

735
01:02:00,791 --> 01:02:02,666
it seems the devil blood of the Kylin

736
01:02:02,666 --> 01:02:04,375
is taken over Wind's body.

737
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:06,333
If the demon inside him attacks again,

738
01:02:06,333 --> 01:02:08,416
we will all meet our doom.

739
01:02:08,416 --> 01:02:11,666
- Mud Buddha, please guide
him to the right path.

740
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:13,375
- I live my life in seclusion

741
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:15,166
because I can't face the world anymore

742
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:17,083
and I don't want to see the future.

743
01:02:17,083 --> 01:02:19,750
- But, he saved your life
before, you have to help him.

744
01:02:21,583 --> 01:02:23,250
- He lives to fight fate.

745
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:26,125
I don't know if there's
anything I can do to help.

746
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:27,166
- Mud Buddha.

747
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:34,916
- Wind is now seeing dreams are not real.

748
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:37,250
Hesitation can bring long regret.

749
01:02:42,583 --> 01:02:46,375
(mellow music)

750
01:02:46,375 --> 01:02:47,291
- [Wind] Where's the Bat Gang?

751
01:02:47,291 --> 01:02:48,208
- You defeated them.

752
01:02:48,208 --> 01:02:49,000
- Did I?

753
01:02:50,625 --> 01:02:54,666
(water splashing)

754
01:02:54,666 --> 01:02:56,208
- You're here!

755
01:02:56,208 --> 01:02:58,208
Please sir, take me as your disciple.

756
01:02:58,208 --> 01:03:00,250
- Captain Xi, what's the matter?

757
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:01,416
- I'm so pathetic.

758
01:03:01,416 --> 01:03:03,125
I'm a disgrace to the whole city.

759
01:03:03,125 --> 01:03:05,416
I'm just a useless, gutless coward.

760
01:03:05,416 --> 01:03:07,333
- Captain Xi, please, get up first.

761
01:03:07,333 --> 01:03:09,500
- Mr. Long Hair, teach me kung fu.

762
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,458
The man with the Kylin tattoo on his arm

763
01:03:11,458 --> 01:03:12,791
has taken everything from me.

764
01:03:12,791 --> 01:03:13,958
I have to get it back.

765
01:03:16,333 --> 01:03:17,666
- What did you say?

766
01:03:17,666 --> 01:03:19,583
A man with a Kylin tattoo on his arm?

767
01:03:20,958 --> 01:03:23,583
(thunder booming)

768
01:03:23,583 --> 01:03:23,875
- Fish!

769
01:03:23,875 --> 01:03:24,666
- Yeah, it's a big one.

770
01:03:24,666 --> 01:03:25,708
We should catch it.

771
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:28,958
Hey look, it's gone over there.

772
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
- You know what I think?

773
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:44,541
There's no reason for you
to give up being a captain

774
01:03:44,541 --> 01:03:45,625
just to be a thief.

775
01:03:47,166 --> 01:03:48,791
You should just go, okay.

776
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:50,125
You can be the captain of the guard

777
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:52,041
and not have to hang out with us thieves.

778
01:03:56,208 --> 01:03:57,583
- I'm not going to be the captain.

779
01:04:03,833 --> 01:04:06,041
But, all of you should
stop stealing from people.

780
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:07,333
Let me take care of you all.

781
01:04:09,666 --> 01:04:11,916
We'll find Peng Li Island together, okay.

782
01:04:17,708 --> 01:04:18,916
- That'll be great.

783
01:04:18,916 --> 01:04:21,208
But, the first thing we should
do is help you get better.

784
01:04:21,208 --> 01:04:22,708
You need to get your memory back.

785
01:04:22,708 --> 01:04:26,208
(giggling)

786
01:04:26,208 --> 01:04:28,041
- Hey, Ying, what's with
that look on your face?

787
01:04:28,041 --> 01:04:29,291
What are you laughing at?

788
01:04:29,291 --> 01:04:30,458
- What look on my face?

789
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,791
- Expert, come over here.

790
01:04:41,291 --> 01:04:43,625
(bird squawking)

791
01:04:43,625 --> 01:04:46,041
Look, the little mama bird is hurt.

792
01:04:46,041 --> 01:04:49,916
(birds squawking)

793
01:04:49,916 --> 01:04:53,041
(thunder booming)

794
01:04:55,333 --> 01:04:56,083
(crashing)

795
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:57,250
(ominous music)

796
01:04:57,250 --> 01:05:00,041
(wind blowing)

797
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:12,750
(somber music)

798
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:15,333
- Cloud.

799
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:22,958
(crashing)

800
01:05:35,125 --> 01:05:40,041
(suspenseful music)

801
01:05:43,083 --> 01:05:44,375
- Help me!

802
01:05:46,708 --> 01:05:48,208
(banging)

803
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,500
(smashing)

804
01:05:56,625 --> 01:06:01,166
(heroic music)

805
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,333
(crashing)

806
01:06:08,583 --> 01:06:09,500
- Hold on tight.

807
01:06:29,541 --> 01:06:31,500
(shouting)

808
01:06:33,291 --> 01:06:35,291
(cheering)

809
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:46,250
(breaking)

810
01:06:47,125 --> 01:06:48,458
- [Yam] The baby birdies!

811
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:55,750
(birds chirping)

812
01:07:03,916 --> 01:07:04,791
- [Ying] Are we all ready?

813
01:07:13,041 --> 01:07:13,750
- Get him.

814
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:19,708
(laughing)

815
01:07:20,625 --> 01:07:22,500
- Wind, how did you and Cloud meet?

816
01:07:23,875 --> 01:07:26,166
- We both had an unhappy childhood.

817
01:07:26,166 --> 01:07:29,416
Our parents were killed by Conquerer.

818
01:07:29,416 --> 01:07:31,708
We both thought the same thing.

819
01:07:31,708 --> 01:07:34,333
For revenge, we first
had to look at our fight.

820
01:07:34,333 --> 01:07:35,791
- My name is Wind.

821
01:07:35,791 --> 01:07:39,666
(somber music)

822
01:07:39,666 --> 01:07:41,791
- Wind, Cloud.

823
01:07:43,083 --> 01:07:44,875
Fate has delivered you both to me.

824
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,166
(laughing)

825
01:07:49,458 --> 01:07:51,791
- [Miss Dream] So, what
was he like before?

826
01:07:51,791 --> 01:07:54,125
- [Wind] Our personalities
were totally different.

827
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,625
(growling)

828
01:07:59,625 --> 01:08:00,875
(shouting)

829
01:08:17,041 --> 01:08:19,208
(whimpering)

830
01:08:26,625 --> 01:08:27,625
(gasping)

831
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:31,000
- Why did you have to kill them?

832
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,750
- They can't protect themselves like this.

833
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:34,208
It's a blessing for them to die young

834
01:08:34,208 --> 01:08:36,125
rather than suffer a life of pain.

835
01:08:40,708 --> 01:08:42,750
- The Cloud I've known for all these years

836
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:44,541
is not the same man now.

837
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:47,083
- [Miss Dream] Are you going
to tell him about his past?

838
01:08:47,083 --> 01:08:49,500
- No, I've never seen him
smile like this before.

839
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:52,500
- It's a blessing for him.

840
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:53,375
He seems happy.

841
01:08:54,791 --> 01:08:57,333
I hope my father can be
happy where he is, too.

842
01:08:58,416 --> 01:08:59,666
- Your father?

843
01:08:59,666 --> 01:09:01,375
- My father left our family to become

844
01:09:01,375 --> 01:09:03,416
the best martial arts expert.

845
01:09:03,416 --> 01:09:05,000
Even when my mother passed away,

846
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,041
he didn't come back.

847
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:07,291
I hated him for it.

848
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:10,291
But, when my mother died,

849
01:09:10,291 --> 01:09:12,750
she said she felt no hate or regret.

850
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:15,500
It changed the way I thought.

851
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,750
In my heart, I know my mother was hoping

852
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:19,666
I would give my father another chance

853
01:09:19,666 --> 01:09:20,791
and forgive him.

854
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:27,291
(somber music)

855
01:09:29,125 --> 01:09:30,750
(laughing)

856
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:35,000
- Revenge is a vicious cycle.

857
01:09:36,416 --> 01:09:38,833
Cloud and I spent half our
lives planning revenge.

858
01:09:39,958 --> 01:09:42,041
But, neither of us knew

859
01:09:42,041 --> 01:09:43,875
revenge doesn't bring peace or joy.

860
01:09:44,916 --> 01:09:47,166
Cloud was known as the God of Death.

861
01:09:47,166 --> 01:09:49,291
I never could've imagined this.

862
01:09:49,291 --> 01:09:50,666
The moment his past is forgotten

863
01:09:50,666 --> 01:09:52,750
marks the beginning of his happiness.

864
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:54,666
It seems if you leave the anger behind,

865
01:09:54,666 --> 01:09:56,083
a new life begins.

866
01:09:57,791 --> 01:09:59,750
(yelling)

867
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:02,083
- [Yam] Hey, Mr. Wind, come play with us.

868
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:16,333
(peaceful music)

869
01:10:24,583 --> 01:10:25,666
- You know, this is the first time

870
01:10:25,666 --> 01:10:27,625
I've seen you happy since I met you.

871
01:10:27,625 --> 01:10:29,416
- We've never really
played like this before.

872
01:10:29,416 --> 01:10:31,500
So, I feel quite happy.

873
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:32,833
- I'm happy for you, too.

874
01:10:32,833 --> 01:10:35,333
You've finally found your good brother.

875
01:10:35,333 --> 01:10:37,291
- And, someone else who cares for me.

876
01:10:38,708 --> 01:10:43,083
(romantic music)

877
01:11:08,708 --> 01:11:09,500
Dream.

878
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:14,125
I'll stay with you and wait
for your father's return.

879
01:11:42,708 --> 01:11:47,458
(banging)

880
01:11:48,833 --> 01:11:51,916
- Life is always full of
ups and downs, Master Wind.

881
01:11:51,916 --> 01:11:54,791
At this moment, do you feel as
though life has blessed you?

882
01:11:57,541 --> 01:12:00,250
If you wish for your brother
to feel the same happiness,

883
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:02,291
you should leave this place immediately.

884
01:12:03,375 --> 01:12:05,666
In your blood runs the spirit of the Kylin

885
01:12:05,666 --> 01:12:08,416
and the Kylin's nemesis
is none other than Cloud.

886
01:12:10,416 --> 01:12:12,208
Wind and Cloud will make you.

887
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:15,875
Yet, Wind and Cloud will break you.

888
01:12:15,875 --> 01:12:19,791
See, the lives of Wind
and Cloud are intertwined

889
01:12:19,791 --> 01:12:22,125
in life but also with death.

890
01:12:22,125 --> 01:12:24,000
If you both want good lives,

891
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
you'll have to live apart from each other

892
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,833
and stay away from the martial arts world.

893
01:12:28,833 --> 01:12:33,500
(pleasant music)

894
01:12:40,291 --> 01:12:41,625
- He died because of you?

895
01:12:41,625 --> 01:12:43,833
If you're brother knew you
lived with such regret,

896
01:12:43,833 --> 01:12:45,958
I'm sure he would forgive you.

897
01:12:45,958 --> 01:12:47,166
- I know he'd forgive me.

898
01:12:47,166 --> 01:12:48,791
I just hope he's found a better place

899
01:12:48,791 --> 01:12:51,291
and can live in happier times.

900
01:12:51,291 --> 01:12:54,541
Will you please have a drink
with me and my brother?

901
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:55,250
- Sure.

902
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:08,875
- I'll be leaving soon.

903
01:13:08,875 --> 01:13:09,666
- Why's that?

904
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:13,375
- I have to find my place in the world.

905
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:20,291
The promise my brother made me,

906
01:13:20,291 --> 01:13:21,958
if it were you, would you have killed me?

907
01:13:23,041 --> 01:13:26,375
- Yes, because we're
brothers and you asked me to.

908
01:13:29,708 --> 01:13:30,541
Take care.

909
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:44,875
(ominous music)

910
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:47,166
- Dream.

911
01:14:17,208 --> 01:14:18,791
- It's Kay.

912
01:14:18,791 --> 01:14:19,666
- Deal with her.

913
01:14:29,375 --> 01:14:33,083
(yelling)

914
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:40,916
(growling)

915
01:14:51,208 --> 01:14:52,416
- Wind, are you okay?

916
01:14:56,166 --> 01:14:58,750
- Striding Cloud!

917
01:15:08,416 --> 01:15:09,250
(breaking)

918
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:13,833
- Wind!

919
01:15:22,458 --> 01:15:23,750
Wind, please stop!

920
01:15:29,916 --> 01:15:31,166
It's me, Wind.

921
01:15:44,208 --> 01:15:45,291
- [Shadow] Stop there.

922
01:15:51,291 --> 01:15:52,416
- We can't let her get away.

923
01:15:52,416 --> 01:15:54,250
- You two really think you can stop me?

924
01:15:57,833 --> 01:16:01,750
(foreboding music)

925
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:03,791
(breaking)

926
01:16:09,458 --> 01:16:11,666
- [Quail] Quickly, get Captain Xi.

927
01:16:11,666 --> 01:16:13,125
- I'm only here for Wind and Cloud.

928
01:16:13,125 --> 01:16:14,500
Get out of the way or die.

929
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:25,833
(gasping)

930
01:16:25,833 --> 01:16:26,791
- You.

931
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:29,041
- Shadow.

932
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:49,000
(fighting)

933
01:16:49,916 --> 01:16:51,250
- You wanna die?

934
01:17:00,041 --> 01:17:01,000
- I'm the captain of the guard.

935
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,375
I have to protect this city.

936
01:17:05,333 --> 01:17:10,333
(ominous music)

937
01:17:14,291 --> 01:17:16,666
Oh, Quail, you fool.

938
01:17:16,666 --> 01:17:18,875
Why on earth didn't you wait for me.

939
01:17:21,916 --> 01:17:23,333
I'm the captain of the guard.

940
01:17:23,333 --> 01:17:25,208
You wanna fight, then fight me.

941
01:17:36,083 --> 01:17:40,000
(gasping)

942
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,125
(rattling)

943
01:17:57,208 --> 01:17:59,333
- The blood of the Flame
Kylin's almost mine.

944
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:03,125
- Please, Master Jue, help me.

945
01:18:10,958 --> 01:18:12,000
- Look, it's Wind.

946
01:18:14,958 --> 01:18:16,166
- Take him alive.

947
01:18:18,166 --> 01:18:23,041
(epic music)

948
01:18:26,583 --> 01:18:31,583
(fighting)

949
01:19:18,875 --> 01:19:19,791
- How do you like this?

950
01:19:19,791 --> 01:19:22,041
I designed this Kylin
lock especially for you.

951
01:19:26,166 --> 01:19:27,333
- [Juno] We have to help Wind.

952
01:19:27,333 --> 01:19:28,291
- [Wood] Yeah, shoot him.

953
01:19:33,625 --> 01:19:36,583
(breaking)

954
01:19:43,916 --> 01:19:44,791
Yam, watch out!

955
01:19:44,791 --> 01:19:47,375
(yelling)

956
01:19:56,791 --> 01:20:01,791
(somber music)

957
01:20:05,916 --> 01:20:08,000
- It really doesn't matter
if I'm this Striding Cloud

958
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:08,625
or not.

959
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:10,791
What's most important right now

960
01:20:10,791 --> 01:20:11,958
is that we're friends.

961
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:15,041
After I save Wind, I'll come back

962
01:20:15,041 --> 01:20:16,833
and we'll go to Peng Li Isle, okay.

963
01:20:19,791 --> 01:20:24,458
(horse galloping)

964
01:20:30,083 --> 01:20:34,791
(ominous music)

965
01:20:52,958 --> 01:20:56,125
- Master Jue, I'm sorry, I was too slow

966
01:20:56,125 --> 01:20:58,875
and I couldn't stop Wind from killing Kay.

967
01:20:58,875 --> 01:21:01,000
But, as soon as you drink
the Flame Kylin's blood,

968
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,541
not even Nameless can stop you.

969
01:21:02,541 --> 01:21:04,208
Soon, the whole martial arts world

970
01:21:04,208 --> 01:21:05,416
will bow before you.

971
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:12,708
A blood leech.

972
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:16,708
- Kay's would was inflicted
by the Kylin Sword.

973
01:21:16,708 --> 01:21:19,791
You think a master swordsmith
is so easily fooled?

974
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:22,500
Are you thinking about
the Ghost Healer now?

975
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:23,958
I invited him earlier.

976
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:30,208
(laughing)

977
01:21:41,625 --> 01:21:42,958
Did you think I wanted to drink the blood

978
01:21:42,958 --> 01:21:44,708
of the Flame Kylin?

979
01:21:44,708 --> 01:21:46,208
I wanted the blood for one thing.

980
01:21:46,208 --> 01:21:48,083
To break the seal binding this sword.

981
01:21:48,958 --> 01:21:50,833
I don't just want the martial arts world,

982
01:21:51,708 --> 01:21:53,791
I want everything under the sky.

983
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:58,625
(foreboding music)

984
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:02,916
(shouting)

985
01:22:07,583 --> 01:22:12,583
(epic music)

986
01:22:20,583 --> 01:22:21,375
- Take him alive!

987
01:22:39,833 --> 01:22:44,708
(fighting)

988
01:23:01,083 --> 01:23:02,000
You wanna save him?

989
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,958
I'll trade him for the
Kylin blood in your body.

990
01:23:18,458 --> 01:23:19,250
- Wind.

991
01:23:29,208 --> 01:23:30,125
- Let him go.

992
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:42,541
- With the Ao ancestors as
witness, I shall release

993
01:23:42,541 --> 01:23:45,416
the Jue Sword from the
Flame Kylin's blood.

994
01:23:45,416 --> 01:23:47,416
I'm not afraid of a
curse on my descendants.

995
01:23:47,416 --> 01:23:49,666
To achieve my revenge, I have no regrets.

996
01:23:57,625 --> 01:23:59,916
(laughing)

997
01:24:20,833 --> 01:24:22,583
Man and sword unite.

998
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:23,791
- Release my friend now.

999
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,833
- Yes, a great blade

1000
01:24:30,833 --> 01:24:32,250
and it will taste your blood.

1001
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:43,375
(epic music)

1002
01:24:54,333 --> 01:24:59,333
(fighting)

1003
01:25:28,916 --> 01:25:32,208
This sword is truly
the king of all swords.

1004
01:25:51,875 --> 01:25:56,583
(fighting)

1005
01:26:26,041 --> 01:26:27,375
Nameless.

1006
01:26:27,375 --> 01:26:28,666
- Ao Jue.

1007
01:26:28,666 --> 01:26:30,000
Turn back from evil.

1008
01:26:43,458 --> 01:26:48,416
(ominous music)

1009
01:27:41,166 --> 01:27:45,666
(epic music)

1010
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,375
That sword is beyond evil.

1011
01:27:54,375 --> 01:27:56,250
It would even kill its own master.

1012
01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:57,500
Give it up.

1013
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:58,416
- Shut up.

1014
01:27:58,416 --> 01:28:01,416
After I kill you I'll be the
greatest fighter in the world.

1015
01:28:01,416 --> 01:28:06,000
(fighting)

1016
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,250
No one.

1017
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:08,416
No one can kill me.

1018
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:15,041
(shouting)

1019
01:28:15,041 --> 01:28:16,541
- The Devil Shadow Technique.

1020
01:28:40,583 --> 01:28:43,791
- Ao Jue's makes you a saint
but evil only begets evil.

1021
01:28:43,791 --> 01:28:45,375
My Sword of the Heavens will break

1022
01:28:45,375 --> 01:28:46,750
the Sword of the Devil.

1023
01:29:05,625 --> 01:29:10,333
(awe-inspiring music)

1024
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:27,458
Be careful.

1025
01:29:27,458 --> 01:29:28,416
Drop the sword.

1026
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:37,208
(screaming)

1027
01:29:38,291 --> 01:29:39,916
(screaming)

1028
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,250
If the Jue Sword's demon
soul gets into your body,

1029
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:46,708
you'll become the Kylin Devil.

1030
01:29:54,208 --> 01:29:58,208
(shouting)

1031
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:15,041
- The devils of the storms.

1032
01:30:15,041 --> 01:30:17,041
Wind and Cloud will fight to the death.

1033
01:30:17,041 --> 01:30:19,458
They won't stop until
one or both are slain.

1034
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:20,708
If you wish to save them,

1035
01:30:20,708 --> 01:30:22,416
then I suggest you release me.

1036
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:36,375
(fighting)

1037
01:30:48,083 --> 01:30:49,333
- Tell me how we can save them.

1038
01:30:49,333 --> 01:30:50,500
- Use that sword.

1039
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:52,666
Use the Kylin Sword to
draw out the Kylin Blood

1040
01:30:52,666 --> 01:30:53,750
in their bodies.

1041
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:55,458
Only then can they return to normal.

1042
01:30:56,541 --> 01:31:01,333
(fighting)

1043
01:31:21,041 --> 01:31:25,916
(epic music)

1044
01:32:40,458 --> 01:32:44,625
(crumbling)

1045
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:47,125
(shouting)

1046
01:33:33,333 --> 01:33:35,291
- Ying, Wind's over here.

1047
01:33:36,333 --> 01:33:37,000
Come help me.

1048
01:33:41,291 --> 01:33:43,208
- [Ying] If you wanna kill
her, you have to go through me.

1049
01:33:53,333 --> 01:33:57,458
(shouting)

1050
01:33:59,958 --> 01:34:03,125
(yelling)

1051
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:06,708
- Oh no, Ying!

1052
01:34:19,833 --> 01:34:21,291
- I'm just glad you're fine.

1053
01:34:26,916 --> 01:34:28,333
- You have to kill Wind now.

1054
01:34:28,333 --> 01:34:30,083
He's lost all his humanity.

1055
01:34:30,083 --> 01:34:32,000
There's no turning back for him.

1056
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:32,750
- No.

1057
01:34:36,416 --> 01:34:37,666
I'll save him, I will.

1058
01:34:38,875 --> 01:34:40,625
There has to be a way to save him.

1059
01:34:55,208 --> 01:34:56,875
This won't end unless you kill him.

1060
01:35:06,208 --> 01:35:11,041
(birds squawking)

1061
01:35:17,958 --> 01:35:20,958
- But, Cloud, don't you wanna
find out about your past?

1062
01:35:21,791 --> 01:35:24,958
- That day, when Wind
asked me if I were Cloud

1063
01:35:24,958 --> 01:35:26,416
would I have been able to kill him,

1064
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:29,375
the old me would've said yes.

1065
01:35:29,375 --> 01:35:30,791
But, I've changed.

1066
01:35:30,791 --> 01:35:32,583
Now, I'll never give up on a friend.

1067
01:35:33,708 --> 01:35:36,375
From now on, I'll only
remember happier days.

1068
01:35:37,458 --> 01:35:42,250
- Huh, Cloud, Ying, I can see the island!

1069
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:46,583
(happy music)

1070
01:36:10,583 --> 01:36:15,541
(soulful music)
