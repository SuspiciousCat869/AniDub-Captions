00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:57,690
-Switch on approach guidance. -Roger that. Approach guidance.

00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,361
[clicking]

4
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,896
It's not responding.

5
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,197
What?

6
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,634
And the autopilot too. Well, all right, then.

7
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,169
We'll do it the old-fashioned way.

8
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:10,804
[co-pilot] Roger.

9
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:12,105
-Huh? -[alarm beeps]

10
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,441
Instrumentation's going haywire.

11
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,309
[pilot] Can we work around it?

12
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:17,410
[co-pilot] No time.

13
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,980
[pilot] Well then, we'll just have to wing it.

14
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,419
[screeching]

15
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:36,496
Lefchitose flight 502 made an emergency landing today,

16
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,531
due to an electrical malfunction,

17
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,601
thankfully without any major damage or injury.

18
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,636
The problem seems to have originated

19
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,139
in the plane's systems control circuit.

20
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,709
Investigators say there appears to be no risk of fire,

21
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:53,213
but as a precaution, similar aircraft have been grounded.

22
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,182
There's also been a report of another system failure

23
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,617
on flight 460.

24
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,520
[Daigo] Is this whole mess all because of Meicoomon?

25
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:01,588
Most likely.

26
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:03,890
Why didn't you tell me this right from the start?

27
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:07,494
Why didn't you let me know that Meicoomon was their target?

28
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:10,497
-[phone rings] -Yes.

29
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,234
Roger. I'm on my way.

30
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,237
Professor Mochizuki just arrived.

31
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,539
If you'd told me about Meicoomon,

32
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:20,773
I might have been able to help

33
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,343
a lot more back there at the school.

34
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:29,449
We have to focus on our next step to counter Meicoomon.

35
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,689
[groans]

36
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,438
[girl] It's absolutely the best...

37
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:53,573
[boy over PA] That's it.

38
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:55,575
Our school festival is officially over.

39
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:56,843
CHAPTER 3: \"CONFESSION\"

40
00:02:56,876 --> 00:03:00,346
A big thanks goes out to all of you who worked so hard on it

41
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,650
and a little thanks to those who didn't. [laughs]

42
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:07,720
We'll have a closing ceremony at 6:00 PM, so don't miss it.

43
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,329
Huh?

44
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,500
You're dancing brought in a whole bunch of people.

45
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,335
We did well because of you.

46
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,870
Oh, thanks, but...

47
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,339
it was all of us together.

48
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,442
[girl] I wish I'd worn that uniform Mimi and Meiko made.

49
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,778
-Next year for sure. -Yeah.

50
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,747
That's true. I can always wear it the next time around.

51
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,750
[chuckles]

52
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:39,953
Thank you.

53
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,356
[girl 1] Where did Meiko go anyway?

54
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,026
-She went to take the trash out. -That was a long time ago.

55
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,896
[girl 2] She seemed so out of sorts all day.

56
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,966
But when I asked her about it, she said she was okay.

57
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,834
I'll go check on her.

58
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,506
[boy 1] They put this 'keep out' sign up yesterday

59
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,675
and started guarding the area.

60
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,477
-What's going on? -[boy 2] I don't know.

61
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,913
[boy 1] Wow, skillful analysis.

62
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,419
-[Mimi] Meimei! -Huh?

63
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,822
Hey, are you okay?

64
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,025
Oh! Oh!

65
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,594
Meimei? Wait!

66
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,297
Where're you going?

67
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:25,732
Stop!

68
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,667
[sobs]

69
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,804
[panting]

70
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,074
[gasps]

71
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,679
-Talk to me. -Oh, Mei!

72
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,682
Meicoomon...

73
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,617
was Leomon.

74
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,787
What did Meicoomon do?

75
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,988
[cries out] Mei!

76
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,328
I know this is hard but....

77
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,030
we're here for you.

78
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,567
We're in this together.

79
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,984
[doorbell rings]

80
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,121
Ken's not home.

81
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,730
Hey, did anyone text you back?

82
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,398
Uh-huh. Not yet.

83
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,801
Was that really him?

84
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,007
[TK] It'll be okay. I know it.

85
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,109
-Huh? -Let's just focus on the facts.

86
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:46,913
Come on.

87
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,583
[sighs]

88
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,155
[Kari] Wow, TK's really grown up.

89
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,625
-Huh? What's that? -Oh, um, nothing.

90
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,127
-Okay. -[chuckles nervously]

91
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,663
[message tone]

92
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,999
-No one was home. -Too bad.

93
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,002
[Agumon] Apparently no one's home here either.

94
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,004
At least no one who'll feed us.

95
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,607
-Hurry up, Tentomon! -I am hurrying.

96
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:18,478
Just slowly. One, two, three, four...

97
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,213
Well, I guess we just need to make eight

98
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,048
since Meicoomon isn't here.

99
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,817
[all sighing]

100
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,986
Make us food, not sad.

101
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:30,022
Sorry, guess I shouldn't have mentioned Meicoomon.

102
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,824
Too soon, Tentomon.

103
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,961
You guys... for now, just stay put.

104
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:38,564
-But do I have to stay hungry? -Oh, I can't take it.

105
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:39,999
Then take these!

106
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,002
[Izzy] We have to figure out what's causing this infection.

107
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:46,139
And fast. Or it could lead to a mutation.

108
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,573
What's happening, Izzy?

109
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,544
These infections... aren't only happening in the digital world.

110
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,112
[chewing appreciatively]

111
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,618
I don't understand.

112
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,887
Meicoomon was so gentle.

113
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,757
Before... did she act... strange?

114
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,530
I don't think there were signs. It was like an outbreak.

115
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,167
[Izzy] We called this an infection.

116
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,136
I don't think we realized how right we were.

117
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,005
[beep]

118
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:23,109
[Izzy] It's way beyond anything we could have hypothesized.

119
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:30,917
[keyboard keys clicking]

120
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:36,656
[groans in frustration]

121
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,532
Sorry, we're late. We were busy cleaning.

122
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,305
-Are you okay? -[Meimei] Ye-- Yes.

123
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,240
I'm sorry for worrying you.

124
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,043
[Izzy] We have to put together some kind of a plan.

125
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,680
Meiko, I need you to answer some questions.

126
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,248
[Meiko] Okay...

127
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,250
Are we sure Meicoomon's infected?

128
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:05,585
Were there any symptoms,

129
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,221
or anything out of the ordinary beforehand?

130
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,022
If so, when did it all start?

131
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,792
Anything you can tell us,

132
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,794
no matter how insignificant could help.

133
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,095
Don't overlook anything.

134
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,932
-Come on, Meiko, think! -[beeping]

135
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:25,004
-[sobs] -That's enough, Izzy.

136
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,206
There is no need for the third degree.

137
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,876
Think before you speak, would you?

138
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:33,112
I'm sorry but we need this information and we need it now!

139
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:35,114
The bad cop routine won't help!

140
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:36,883
There's no time to waste!

141
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,784
The infection could be spreading...

142
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,720
or mutating, feelings are trivial!

143
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,155
Trivial? Come on!

144
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,124
Knock it off, both of you!

145
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:50,730
[Mimi] Humph.

146
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,932
Huh? Meimei!

147
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,801
[Meimei] It's all my fault [sobs]

148
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:57,803
Mei!

149
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,841
[sobs] I should have...

150
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:07,179
I'm so sorry!

151
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,927
[Joe] All right, everybody. Gotta go.

152
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,331
Later.

153
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,200
Yeah.

154
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,875
Mega level, huh. Not bad.

155
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,910
Yeah. Pretty cool.

156
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,012
Izzy said this might have predicted that.

157
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,681
Huh?

158
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,684
[TK] \"Those who crave true power

159
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,286
must seek the darkness but move past it.\"

160
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,189
So what does that mean?

161
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,958
Don't look at me. I don't know.

162
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:52,992
Eeh.

163
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,028
But if more of our digimon reach mega level,

164
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,364
we won't have to rely on Omnimon.

165
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,935
It'd be... easier on you.

166
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,241
Anyway... see ya.

167
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,314
[door opens]

168
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,816
[Meiko] I'm home.

169
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:21,087
Meiko! The school festival was amazing. Great job!

170
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,756
So, to celebrate, I made your favorite.

171
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,392
Ta-da! Tempura.

172
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,730
-Where is dad? -Uh, working.

173
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,832
He might have to pull an all-nighter again.

174
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:35,001
He has so many meetings these days.

175
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:39,038
It's because of Meicoomon... isn't it?

176
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:40,740
Hmm.

177
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,443
Officer Himekawa has the damage report.

178
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,012
[Himekawa] Thank you.

179
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,246
So far...

180
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,018
we have identified 13 spots around the city

181
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,453
and 52 across the country.

182
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,356
And we're having problems

183
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,393
with feedback affecting electronic transmissions,

184
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,261
especially at the airport,

185
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,397
which is close enough to the disturbances

186
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,564
for flights to be affected.

187
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:10,236
There were four emergency landings there this week alone.

188
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:13,139
One place nearly crashed into another.

189
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,041
It's currently under surveillance

190
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,909
and we're watching other runways as well.

191
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,978
[chair] Thoughts, Dr. Mochizuki?

192
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,049
All right, well, before this outbreak occurred,

193
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,484
there was an unconfirmed sighting

194
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,487
of an unidentified digimon at the high school.

195
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,258
[chair] And you believe that's related to this situation?

196
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,260
I can't conclusively confirm that yet.

197
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,898
But... it certainly does seem possible

198
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:41,400
given the circumstance we find ourselves in now.

199
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:47,940
[sighs]

200
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,376
This is worse than I thought.

201
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,479
Yes, it sounds like it's going to happen again.

202
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,214
Even more victims.

203
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:03,322
I really don't want to put those kids through... all of that.

204
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:04,356
I know.

205
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:14,900
Dr. Mochizuki?

206
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,471
-What is it? -Well, it's...

207
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,307
-It's about your daughter, sir. -What, Meiko?

208
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,910
[Daigo] It's just that she's very upset, sir.

209
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,245
That's all.

210
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,915
[Dr. Mochizuki] I'm sorry if it's caused you distress.

211
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,551
I'll speak with her when I return home.

212
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:37,990
[car coming]

213
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,298
[Daigo] Huh?

214
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,000
[car door closes]

215
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:50,302
Matt?

216
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,239
-What's wrong? -I need information.

217
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,474
We're in a tight spot right now.

218
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,477
I'll take all I can get.

219
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,416
Please help us.

220
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,185
[Himekawa] This is highly irregular.

221
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,521
You're asking us to break protocol.

222
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,326
All right.

223
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,997
I mean, you are involved, after all.

224
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,899
So I suppose you ought to know.

225
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,336
What you're reading is called the fifth interim report.

226
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,973
Only speak of it to the other digi-destined. For now, anyway.

227
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,543
That covers everything we know happened

228
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,111
during the school festival.

229
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,579
Lots of facts to analyze.

230
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,015
We'll have to tell the media soon.

231
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,416
It'll be a circus.

232
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,320
But eventually, everything is going to come out.

233
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,989
Can you give me any information about Ken?

234
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,425
Yes, of course, we always keep tabs

235
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,060
on all of the digi-destined.

236
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:50,996
[Himekawa] Don't worry about Ken.

237
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,965
[sighs] I was only worried

238
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,667
because I couldn't get ahold of him.

239
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,335
[Himekawa] Let the others know.

240
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:59,305
The Meicoomon investigation will start immediately.

241
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,408
We'll do our best to collaborate as much as possible.

242
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,147
We'll let you know if anything changes.

243
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,416
Are we good?

244
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,418
Thank you very much.

245
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,487
See you tomorrow, right?

246
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,263
-Himekawa, you crossed the line. -Why is that?

247
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,465
You straight up lied to him.

248
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,634
You think I should be honest all the time?

249
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,238
Don't you realize they would panic

250
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,274
if they knew how many digi-destined are missing.

251
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:38,644
My job is to partly to shield them from things.

252
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:41,280
That requires deception from time to time.

253
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,581
What about the fact that

254
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,683
Meicoomon is the root of all of this?

255
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,951
But if they knew that,

256
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:49,188
how do you think it would affect their relationship with Meiko?

257
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,692
Preserve their innocence at least for a while.

258
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,628
They'll figure it out soon enough anyway.

259
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:56,562
[groans]

260
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,397
[Daigo] But why?

261
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,334
Why keep the truth from me too?

262
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,436
Do you think that I'm untrustworthy?

263
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,708
Sometimes ignorance is bliss.

264
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,019
[sighs]

265
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,628
-[Dr. Mochizuki] Meiko. -Huh?

266
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,498
Father, I brought you a change of clothes.

267
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:33,565
Thank you, Meiko.

268
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,134
Please let your mother know

269
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,102
that I won't be coming home until late.

270
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,238
-Yes... -Get home safely.

271
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,107
But, um... About Meicoomon....

272
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,578
Sorry, my meeting's about to start.

273
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,547
Father...

274
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,184
I'm so sorry.

275
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:56,188
Just leave it to us. We'll handle this, Meiko.

276
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:23,649
[sneezes]

277
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,387

\"Are you okay? Mimi.\"

279
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,121
Reboot, huh?

280
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,324

-[alarm buzzes] -[groans]

282
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,170
Oh, come on!

283
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,472
I just can't crack this thing.

284
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,808
[all] Oh!

285
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,619
Meiko, your friend's here.

286
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:34,686
Uh?

287
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,524
[Sora] I stopped by to bring you the homework

288
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,426
we were given for summer vacation.

289
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:41,760
Oh, thank you.

290
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,396
-[Sora] Are you eating? -Huh?

291
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,231
You have to try to pull it together.

292
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,167
-Oh... -You need to...

293
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,369
eat and get some sleep.

294
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,305
[giggles] You're like a mother hen.

295
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,873
-[Meiko giggles] -What, no way!

296
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,375
Tai said the same thing.

297
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,445
-Boy, you try to be nice... -I'm sorry.

298
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,114
Oh, now it's okay.

299
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,251
Tai had trouble before too.

300
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,319
He did?

301
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,489
There was a time awhile back when Agumon dark-digivolved.

302
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,357
[gasps]

303
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:16,628
I know. But Agumon is totally fine again, you see?

304
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:20,866
Just remember that we and our digimon are outliers.

305
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,302
Different than the others.

306
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,437
We're always connected.

307
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,206
[sobs]

308
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,409
[Sora] I truly believe that.

309
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,615
It's okay to let it out.

310
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,287
That's the whole reason why I came.

311
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:45,824
[sobs and cries]

312
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,749
[Joe] Oh! It looks like a tornado hit...

313
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,652
after a hurricane and a typhoon.

314
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,661
-[Izzy groans] -Huh? [screams]

315
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:26,398
Black tea... Please.

316
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,233
[Joe] You don't have to finish it all in one gulp,

317
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,301
you know.

318
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,570
And how long have you been awake?

319
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,572
How long ago was the school festival?

320
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:34,706
[cries out] What?

321
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,875
That is really not good.

322
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,912
Izzy, if you're too tired, then you can't get anything done.

323
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,380
Studying taught me that.

324
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,615
Honestly, it's about the only thing it taught me.

325
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,352
You know, you seem more upbeat than usual.

326
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,421
Oh, yeah? Do I?

327
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:50,789
Is it really that obvious?

328
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,524
What should I call it?

329
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,760
Maybe awakening or insight.

330
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:58,430
Or maybe just being tired of being tired of studying.

331
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,999
It's like I Joe-volved to mega level.

332
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,302
[chuckles]

333
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,872
Uh, anyway, where are the digimon?

334
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,674
They're in the server now.

335
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,677
It's the safest place for them to be to avoid the infection.

336
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,245
[all saying hello]

337
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:14,713
I gotta be honest.

338
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,283
I actually found some coding errors even inside our PC.

339
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,652
-And our server too. -Huh?

340
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,387
Don't worry. I fixed them.

341
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,922
It's all fine now.

342
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,257
That's good I guess.

343
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,559
When I cross-referenced the data,

344
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,795
it matched up with when Meicoomon

345
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,730
was infected at the school festival.

346
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,766
-The same thing that caused 'em. -I don't know yet.

347
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,736
It'll take time to figure out and find countermeasures.

348
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,905
How about you find your way to bed?

349
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,640
You need to sleep.

350
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:42,608
And I'm willing to bet

351
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,743
a shower would do you a world of good too.

352
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,746
Well, I know it would certainly do my nose good.

353
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,514
[laughs] I mean if I had one.

354
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:53,285
All work and no shower makes Izzy a lonely boy.

355
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,054
[Tentomon] Oh, the smell-manity!

356
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,627
-Hey, Joe. -TK, what's up?

357
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,861
Where's Izzy?

358
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,698
[Joe] He preferred the sleeping bag to the couch.

359
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,369
-Out cold. -Finally got him to take a nap.

360
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,971
He's been working so hard. It isn't healthy.

361
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,107
Do you think he feels responsible?

362
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,409
Think so. He's on a mission.

363
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,379
I mean since Meicoomon has become infected.

364
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,382
Just look at the really awful stuff that's happened.

365
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:24,883
But it'll be okay.

366
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,353
The infection won't spread to the other digimon so easily.

367
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:29,988
Thinking positive, huh?

368
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,491
Well, if you focus on the negative,

369
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:34,393
it's more likely to happen.

370
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:35,994
[Patamon] TK!

371
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:39,031
You're back! Wow!

372
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:42,768
-Patamon! -It's time you came to visit.

373
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,569
[Gomamon] And about time we came out!

374
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,004
Oh, yeah!

375
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:47,606
[Tentomon] Count me in too!

376
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,043
Or is it count me out? I'm so confused.

377
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:52,077
Whee!

378
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,013
-You've been waiting all along? -[Patamon] And bored too.

379
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,916
We were trying to stay out of Izzy's hair.

380
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:00,052
Well... all of his parts, really.

381
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:03,889
-Except the part that feeds us. -Get cracking with the snacking.

382
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,158
Sure feels like a long time since I've seen this little guy.

383
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:07,392
[Patamon] Aww.

384
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,899
Hey, stop. That tickles.

385
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,601
-Patamon... -Hmm?

386
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,570
[TK] No!

387
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,105
No, this can't happen.

388
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,544
[Patamon growling]

389
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:26,578
Patamon!

390
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:30,148
Please just calm down. It's gonna be okay.

391
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,383
[TK groans]

392
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:32,584
TK?

393
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,153
[TK] Patamon, please.

394
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,690
[Patamon gasping]

395
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,026
-[Joe] What's the matter? -[TK] Uh, nothing.

396
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:42,627
Patamon?

397
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,997
[Patamon snarling]

398
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,833
[TK] Come on, buddy. You gotta fight it.

399
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,102
[Patamon groaning]

400
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,504
Huh?

401
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,877
[Patamon] TK, you're kinda smushing me!

402
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,479
Oh, sorry about that.

403
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,147
What's going on, TK?

404
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,082
We're just hugging it out, you know.

405
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,784
Don't get carried away.

406
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,819
Izzy's gonna be upset if you break your digimon.

407
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:08,854
Right.

408
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:10,856
TK?

409
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,724
Uh, oh, uh...

410
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:14,726
Don't worry. It's just a scratch, see?

411
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,995
Oh!

412
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,165
[Patamon] Must have been some serious hugging.

413
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:24,169
I'm starting to think, you're trying to smush me.

414
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,138
Seeing Izzy wrapped up like that

415
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:27,873
makes me want some chips and salsa.

416
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,742
[Gomamon] You're right. He looks like a bean and cheese burrito.

417
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,911
-[Tentomon] Ooh, burritos! -Hey, Joe.

418
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:35,614
What if our digimon...

419
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:36,681
[chomping]

420
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:39,451
What if our digimon get infected?

421
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:41,119
-[Joe] What do you mean? -[sighing]

422
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,588
[TK] Just what if? What would we do?

423
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,591
-[Joe] We'd have to fight them. -We all need a takeout.

424
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,895
Huh?

425
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:54,466
Doesn't Izzy research that kind of thing so we don't have to?

426
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,535
[TK] Yeah. I guess.

427
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,138
[TK] I'm gonna head home.

428
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,174
Right. Hey.

429
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:05,010
Hold on, you're taking Patamon?

430
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,245
That a problem?

431
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,580
Of course it is.

432
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,950
But, uh... isn't it unwise to have them all in one place?

433
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:14,219
I mean, what if something bad happened?

434
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:17,622
-Hmm. -For example, as a worst case...

435
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,158
if one got infected, we could have an outbreak.

436
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:21,560
Don't say that!

437
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:24,596
[all] Huh?

438
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,233
[TK] Right. Sorry.

439
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:30,402
It's just...

440
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,572
Look, Joe, I just really want to spend

441
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,207
a little quality time with Patamon.

442
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,742
I'm sure we all feel that way.

443
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:39,711
[Patamon] I wanna go with TK!

444
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:43,648
I wanna go with TK! I wanna go with TK!

445
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,016
I wanna go!

446
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,018
Sorry, but you can't...

447
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:49,621
[Patamon] No, no, no! And I mean no for real!

448
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:52,657
I'm going with TK and that's that!

449
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,094
[snoring]

450
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:02,300
[Patamon] This is kind of fun, isn't it?

451
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:05,804
[laughs]

452
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:07,806
Yeah, kinda.

453
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,910
I did what you wanted, right? You looked so worried.

454
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:14,312
I just knew that I had to come home with you.

455
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,182
[giggles]

456
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:19,217
-[TK] Let's go. -[Patamon] Okay.

457
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,788
[TV] This high pressure front

458
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,323
means sunny skies in the East.

459
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,892
[Mom] How are you doing?

460
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:28,260
[Meiko] I just need to get my shoes on.

461
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,929
[Mom] You sure you want to go to school, honey?

462
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,899
-I'm fine, Mom. -See you later.

463
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,001
Okay, see ya.

464
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:39,271
Oh, Meicoomon...

465
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,806
Stop it.

466
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,277
[students talking]

467
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:48,847
-Hi, Meiko. -Oh, good morning.

468
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,782
I was just looking for you.

469
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:54,185
I slept so soundly I barely had time to finish breakfast.

470
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,887
Wanna have lunch together?

471
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,890
Uh... Awesome.

472
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:00,892
[Mimi] Meimei!

473
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,795
-Good morning, Mimi. -[Mimi squeals]

474
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,400
I'm sorry. I really should've--

475
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:10,402
Hey, hey, hey, it's nothing. Forget it.

476
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:11,770
Not quite.

477
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:12,804
[all gasping]

478
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,640
-It's like you just disappeared. -I didn't mean to.

479
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,275
Now, just relax.

480
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:19,744
Matt only meant that he was worried about you.

481
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:22,948
-Can't you tell by his face? -You're a tandura.

482
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,849
Now you're just making up words!

483
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,118
-[Mimi] Matt's a stinky tandura! -[Tai] But, seriously...

484
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,219
Uh, yes?

485
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,889
Izzy's really trying hard.

486
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,391
He spends all his time in his office now.

487
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,794
He's gonna figure this whole infected thing out.

488
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,698
If anyone can find a solution, he can.

489
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,333
-Right, Mimi? -[Mimi] Enough.

490
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,836
She gets the point already. She's a smart girl.

491
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,338
Or are you saying otherwise?

492
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,206
Oh, I'm sorry.

493
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,908
[Meiko] But I want to know what's happening.

494
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,377
And I really should apologize to Izzy.

495
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,712
Then we'll go together.

496
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:56,781
Please don't make things more complicated and dramatic.

497
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,951
-I'm not dramatic. -Don't pay any attention to him.

498
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,187
I'm sure Izzy will figure it out.

499
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,022
He'll save everyone and Meicoomon.

500
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:05,256
I hope.

501
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,195
[Joe] So you just took Patamon home with you?

502
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:11,930
Uh-huh.

503
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,865
Izzy was really upset.

504
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:17,068
Patamon was just homesick. He misses me.

505
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,804
-Don't be selfish. -Look, everything's fine.

506
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:23,174
If anything goes wrong, I'll send him straight back to Izzy.

507
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,877
[Kari] Wow! Meiko's actually here?

508
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:28,146
[Meiko] Good to see you.

509
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:31,149
Why does only Patamon get to go home?

510
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:33,385
All of us miss our digimon, you know?

511
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:36,488
-[TK] I know. -Well, it's not just Patamon.

512
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:37,989
They've all been complaining

513
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:39,924
about being stuck inside the server.

514
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,727
Do you think it's wise to take your digimon home?

515
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:43,995
-Or stupid? -[all] Hmm?

516
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,366
I don’t know. I'd love to have Biyomon at home but is it safe?

517
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,136
It's too risky. What if they get infected?

518
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:52,971
We'd have to fight them.

519
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,006
Don't say things like that.

520
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:57,809
How could we?

521
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,144
We're partners.

522
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,380
-What a mess. -I know.

523
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,949
TK... You see now

524
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:07,452
why we can't really take them out of where they're safe.

525
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,324
[TK gasps]

526
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,462
-What's wrong, TK? -Oh...

527
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,397
[TK] It's nothing.

528
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,434
-TK? -[TK] Patamon's fine.

529
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,935
I just want more time with him.

530
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:28,373
-Oh... -I'm sure... they'll be okay.

531
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:29,774
Come on.

532
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,812
It's still not fair. They should all come home then.

533
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:38,116
Well, why don't they? Once in a while can't hurt, right?

534
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,953
We can have them hang out at Izzy's while we're in school,

535
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:45,056
-and pick them up our way home. -That's right.

536
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,424
And if we're all watching them,

537
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,426
we'll notice if anything changes.

538
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,896
We'll be more informed and can alert everyone in the group.

539
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,832
It's just like taking a kid to daycare.

540
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,934
Yeah, they're practically our kids anyway.

541
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:58,570
I say Sora's right about Joe being right.

542
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:02,107
Guys, this is serious. We need to keep an eye on the situation.

543
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,075
Yep, we will when we get 'em.

544
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:07,112
[Mimi] Get 'em? Can't Izzy just email them to us?

545
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,214
[Joe] You must have a great data plan.

546
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,483
Truth is the Internet may not be secure.

547
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,251
We have to pick them up to stay safe.

548
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:15,253
[Mimi] Haste makes you knock on wood.

549
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:18,189
[Sora] Uh, yeah. Or something like that.

550
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:19,924
[Mimi] Matt, what do you think?

551
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,559
You still say it's too risky?

552
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:23,561
[Matt] Well, Gabumon's sure gonna be upset

553
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,330
if he's the only one left behind.

554
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,966
[Mimi] You say that like you have no choice.

555
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:29,300
But you can't hide that smile.

556
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:32,570
-Tandura! Tandura! -[Matt] Stop making up words.

557
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,973
All right. So we agree. Let's try it.

558
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:37,408
-You guys... -[all] Oh!

559
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:40,445
Sorry, Meimei.

560
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,413
We just got caught up in the moment.

561
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:47,152
Oh! It's fine. Don't feel bad because of me.

562
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,888
Well, I should get home.

563
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,923
Go pick up your digimon.

564
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:55,860
I bet they'll be happy to go home with you.

565
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,263
Thanks.

566
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,031
[Joe] Let's get 'em and see how it goes.

567
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:01,966
Hopefully better than usual.

568
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,402
-[Mimi] Bye, guys. -[Sora] See you soon.

569
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:07,205
-[Mimi] Go have fun. -Do something, Meimei. Text me.

570
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:08,339
I'm sorry.

571
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,542
None of that made you feel any better.

572
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:11,976
It's okay.

573
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,078
I've got homework to do.

574
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,247
-See you, TK. -Meiko!

575
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,487
Can we talk somewhere before you go home?

576
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:26,257
[Meiko] Are you really saying that Patamon's already...

577
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:29,360
I'm a horrible person.

578
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,497
I told them all that their digimon would be okay.

579
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,032
Like Patamon.

580
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,401
I lied.

581
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:37,969
I couldn't be honest.

582
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,004
It was too hard.

583
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:41,339
I get it.

584
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:43,575
It hurts.

585
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,110
[TK] What do I do?

586
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:48,580
What if I can't save Patamon?

587
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,417
I mean, what if Patamon...

588
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,519
What if Patamon starts acting...

589
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,057
-[Meiko] TK... -[TK sobs]

590
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,025
[Meiko] You poor thing.

591
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:02,894
[TK] The whole thing sucks.

592
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:07,999
-[TK] Sorry. -[Meiko] No, I'm sorry.

593
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,368
I'm so, so sorry.

594
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,370
This is all my fault.

595
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:15,640
Uh, no. Really.

596
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,675
I didn't mean for that to sound...

597
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,979
like I was trying to blame you. Forget it.

598
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,715
After all that's happened, I should be comforting you.

599
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:25,550
I'm just a selfish idiot.

600
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,252
[Meiko] You're wrong.

601
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,120
It is my fault.

602
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:46,404
[TK] All right. Put on a good face.

603
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:51,542
-I'm home. -Welcome back, TK!

604
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,012
[both giggling]

605
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:55,613
I didn't bring you anything.

606
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,649
Don't worry. It's okay.

607
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:01,419
Although, I mean, a candy bar would be kinda nice. [giggles]

608
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:06,224
Aha. Again with the smushing.

609
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:12,430
It's been happening all day long. Pretty weird.

610
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,767
Listen, TK.

611
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,202
This means I'm infected, doesn't it?

612
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,673
[chuckles] Thought so.

613
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,575
[TK] Patamon, I...

614
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:27,712
That's why you took me away from the others, right?

615
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:32,383
Because I might end up like Meicoomon?

616
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,219
[TK] No! You're gonna be okay!

617
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,057
[Patamon] TK...

618
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,227
If I start to go berserk...

619
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:46,030
you'll have to take me down.

620
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,001
[TK] Don't ever say that!

621
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:53,171
But I don't want to make everyone sad, TK.

622
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:55,773
[TK] I could never...

623
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:59,243
Just listen. I'm okay with it.

624
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:02,146
Whatever happens, it was worth meeting you.

625
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,148
It'll be all right.

626
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:12,190
I'm sorry. I know it will make you sad but you'll have to.

627
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,193
Patamon...

628
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:17,195
Don't cry, okay.

629
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,499
[both sobbing]

630
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,167
Patamon...

631
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,536
TK...

632
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,784
[doorbell rings]

633
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,121
[Patamon] Someone's at the door.

634
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,594
-Oh, hey, Matt. -Gabumon!

635
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:52,563
-So they tell me. -Let's get down to it.

636
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,832
Eh, what do you mean?

637
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,567
[Matt] First, can you turn on a light.

638
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,669
[TK] Oh, I hadn't noticed.

639
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,805
[Matt] It's too dark to notice anything.

640
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:03,207
I see snacks.

641
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,742
So what brings you here?

642
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,577
[Matt] Well, uh...

643
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:09,514
did you have a fight with Tai in the past hour?

644
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,415
-[TK] No. -[Matt] Sora?

645
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,750
[TK] Why on earth would I fight with Sora?

646
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,288
-So, Joe? Mimi? -What's your deal?

647
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:19,624
Do I always have to be fighting with somebody?

648
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:22,160
-It's kinda your thing. -He has a point.

649
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:23,728
You're not helping, you know.

650
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:25,830
Look, this isn't about me.

651
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:27,565
Huh?

652
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:29,133
Something's up with you.

653
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:33,304
[both] Ooh...

654
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,574
[Matt] Well, what is it?

655
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,876
I'm not leaving till you level with me.

656
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,511
So, start talking.

657
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,346
I'm scared...

658
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:44,415
Huh?

659
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,756
...that everyone's gonna finally realize

660
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,624
you're a terrible guitarist.

661
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:58,563
[Matt] Huh?

662
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,301
Eh, you little...

663
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,537
You really had me going there for a minute!

664
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,506
-[TK] Sucker. -[Matt] Not funny.

665
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:11,342
Okay. Kinda.

666
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:12,443
[phone ringing]

667
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,781
Sora?

668
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:18,716
What would she be calling me about?

669
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,219
-Go on. Answer. -I'm gonna.

670
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,653
Hello.

671
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:26,858
Just making Matt mad. You know, the usual. You okay?

672
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:28,860
Um-hmm. Yeah.

673
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,462
Just thought I'd call and check.

674
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:32,797
Okay, talk to you later.

675
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,399
Well, that's done. Next?

676
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,402
-Looks like Izzy. -Izzy it is.

677
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,805
Hey, Izzy. Just wanted to say thanks

678
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:42,473
for all your hard work yesterday.

679
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,209
Of course, and today too.

680
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:47,578
Right, and the day before. Sure.

681
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:50,214
Listen, don't forget to eat. And sleep.

682
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:52,216
But not at the same time. [laughs]

683
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,852
Okay, that's it from me. Goodbye, Izzy.

684
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,421
[Sora sighs]

685
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:01,425
Sora, you always do a good job of taking care of everyone else.

686
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,794
-Well, we're friends. -It's just...

687
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,696
With everything that's going on,

688
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,498
I get worried about everyone.

689
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:10,201
It really is nice that you're so thoughtful.

690
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:11,702
Thanks so much.

691
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,804
That's why they call me a mother hen.

692
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,806
-But what about you? -Huh?

693
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,476
You need to take care of yourself too, don't you?

694
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,878
Myself?

695
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,980
Not an option?

696
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,683
Well, selflessness is one of your best treats.

697
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,387
All right, since you're my favorite person,

698
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,588
I'll take care of you.

699
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:31,856
Sound good?

700
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:33,457
[giggles]

701
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:40,565
[Sora] Thanks, Biyomon. That means a lot.

702
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:07,625
[man 1] Flight 194, proceed to....

703
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:08,826
[man 2] Whoa!

704
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,930
[man 1] It's a blackout! Start the generator!

705
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:14,832
[man 2] It's not working.

706
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,568
[man 3] There's no power. But the planes...

707
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,674
[computer] The time has come.

708
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:26,410
The era of destruction is at hand.

709
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:29,580
Digimon shall roam free again

710
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:32,450
because your world is completely reliant

711
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:34,619
on its digital infrastructure,

712
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:37,855
it is fragile, extremely fragile.

713
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:40,024
It is a house of cards...

714
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:42,560
Breaking News: Massive blackout in part of the Kanto region.

715
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,029
...ever teetering on the brink of complete collapse.

716
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,398
It must be acknowledged.

717
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,968
The era of complete catastrophe is upon us.

718
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,939
[TV] The waterfront area was left

719
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:57,608
completely without power yesterday evening.

720
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:58,776
It's now been restored

721
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,911
but the reason for the outage remains unknown.

722
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:04,415
It's suspected to be related to the mysterious messages

723
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,716
seen all over the Internet.

724
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,917
Massive Blackout again in the Kanto region.

725
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,587
Across the region, nervous residents are scooping up

726
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,888
emergency supplies

727
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:12,823
in case of another power loss.

728
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,060
\"Digimon shall roam free.\"

729
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:18,062
What does that mean?

730
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,000
Wait, you guys are still here?

731
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,869
You're gonna be late.

732
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:25,903
Right.

733
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,973
Oh, can you pick up ice cream for dessert on the way home.

734
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,575
-And milk, too? -Got it.

735
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:34,445
Everybody else in the world's worried about a catastrophe.

736
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,013
And mom's just worried about dairy products.

737
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:37,048
[giggles]

738
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:40,751
-I knew I loved your mom. -Your priorities are a mess.

739
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,920
Glad you still have your appetite.

740
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:44,755
[chuckles]

741
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,862
[Agumon] He's still ignoring us.

742
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,964
[Palmon] It's like he's been hypnotized.

743
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:58,636
[Palmon] How long do you think he can stay like this?

744
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:01,072
It's gonna be a long night.

745
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:03,774
[Gabumon] Say something to him, Agumon. He's freaking me out.

746
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,410
Hey, there, Izzy. Trouble with anything?

747
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:08,112
-Like your hearing? -Oh, relax.

748
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:11,816
Izzy gets this way sometimes because, well, he's Izzy.

749
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,385
-Less talk-- -More snacks, I know.

750
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:15,753
-[buzzing sound] -[Izzy gasps]

751
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,489
-So he can move. -Well, that's a start.

752
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:21,759
Shh, come on, you guys. We have to let Izzy do his work.

753
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:25,796
Otherwise he won't get it done. And if he doesn't get it done,

754
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,665
the longer he'll be doing it.

755
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:34,572
[squeaking]

756
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,141
-Huh? -Uh-huh.

757
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:42,179
[thumping]

758
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:45,182
[Izzy typing]

759
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:51,555
Ma'am, the digimon. They've all been departing Izzy's building.

760
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,190
What's our next move?

761
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,092
Just follow them.

762
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,532
[boy] Man, I'm hungry.

763
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,134
[boy 2] Who wants some snacks?

764
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,736
[girl] How did you handle the blackout?

765
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,105
[girl 2] Same way I handle everything. Bad.

766
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,074
[Boy 3] They should have given us the day off.

767
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:12,576
[Boy 4] Yeah, an early summer vacation.

768
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:33,764
-[phone rings] -Huh?

769
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:36,734
[Kari] Huh, I thought I turned this thing off.

770
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:41,872
-[ringing continues] -Uh...

771
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:44,208
Hello?

772
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:55,753
The time...

773
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:57,888
has arrived.

774
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:06,163
[Gatomon] Do you think it was okay to leave Izzy's place

775
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:07,264
without asking first?

776
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:10,935
Well, we already left so we can't really ask second.

777
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,304
Oh, I don't know, I always ask for seconds.

778
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:16,907
Well, I just didn't want to bother bothering Izzy.

779
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:18,509
So what are we gonna do?

780
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:21,946
I think we've already proven we can stand around doing nothing.

781
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:22,980
But guys,

782
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:26,116
we have to make sure we don't expose ourselves to infection.

783
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,018
[Patamon] Funny you should say that.

784
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:30,120
[Gabumon] What's up?

785
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,590
It's, um... Thing is...

786
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:34,992
Well, I'm infected.

787
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,695
[all scream]

788
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:41,732
[Gomamon] That is so not good. Are you sure?

789
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:44,134
[Patamon] Yeah, I'm sure it's not good.

790
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:47,905
-Does being infected hurt? -No, it's just a little scary.

791
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:50,674
Does he know yet, TK?

792
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,210
Uh-huh, but he said not to tell anyone.

793
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,246
I guess I didn't do that too well.

794
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:57,348
But shouldn't we let all the others know?

795
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,550
No, not yet. Please, guys.

796
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,887
If you're infected there's no point in us staying at Izzy's.

797
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,321
But we should at least tell him

798
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,290
so he can help figure out your options.

799
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,359
[Tentomon] Maybe he can digivaccinate you.

800
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:10,194
Please don't. Listen, guys,

801
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:13,130
I'm just going to leave so I don't infect anybody else.

802
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:15,032
But where will you go?

803
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,567
[Patamon sighs]

804
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:21,705
Sora's gonna freak out if there are any more problems.

805
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,641
Mimi too.

806
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,776
I don't want to upset anyone but if you--

807
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:29,013
You have to promise me that if I start to go berserk...

808
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,385
you'll take me down.

809
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:36,687
-No! No way! -Don't say that.

810
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,188
[Patamon] Look, you're like my family.

811
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,356
[all] Aww.

812
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:42,293
I just couldn't bear it if I infected you.

813
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,994
I couldn't.

814
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:47,965
-[Agumon] Oh, Patamon! -I know.

815
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:55,372
[all gasp]

816
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:02,980
[Palmon] Kari? What're you doing here?

817
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:04,982
[Agumon] Not that we have a reason to be here.

818
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:07,251
It's not like one of us is infected or anything.

819
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:09,053
-[Agumon giggles nervously] -Listen to me.

820
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,854
[all] Wha...

821
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:15,759
-Not sure I like the new look. -[whimpers]

822
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:17,127
You're right.

823
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:19,863
-That's not Kari. -Then who is it.

824
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:25,002
[fake Kari] I am... the one who longs for stability.

825
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:28,339
I borrowed this body so that I could talk to you.

826
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:31,775
Is that... Kari?

827
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:35,379
You see... this world's in serious danger.

828
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:38,682
And the same goes for the digital world.

829
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:40,250
[all gasp in horror]

830
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,320
Those digimon who've become infected

831
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,723
are causing major problems.

832
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:49,460
They're continually terrorizing the quantized world

833
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:51,729
and disrupting its continuity.

834
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,665
-Quantized world? -Continuity?

835
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,868
[fake Kari] The digital devices of your world

836
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:00,037
and the surrounding sphere of the Internet

837
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,872
that was created from them

838
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,041
bred the digital world.

839
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:08,312
In essence, it emerged from the quantum sea.

840
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:12,249
More worlds than you can imagine have come into being this way.

841
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,786
Some worlds are as different as night and day

842
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,322
and yet they still exist side by side.

843
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:22,793
However, if these so called infected digimon

844
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,396
are able to breach the quantized world,

845
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,731
then in all likelihood,

846
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:30,467
they will destroy the digital world in the process.

847
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,870
It will cease to exist.

848
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:36,407
And humanity's electronic devices will fail as well.

849
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:38,342
[Tentomon] Wait, let me get this straight,

850
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,210
the digital world would be destroyed?

851
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:42,112
And this one would be too?

852
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:43,881
Sadly, yes.

853
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:45,983
And it is also likely...

854
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:49,219
that all of you would perish with the digital world too.

855
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:52,056
-That can't be true! -[all digimon] Oh, no!

856
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,762
Isn't there anything we can do?

857
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:06,003
There is only one way to avoid this grave fate.

858
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,838
Just one.

859
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:10,074
[all] One way? What?

860
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:12,976
A tremendous sacrifice.

861
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:17,915
When Meicoomon next emerges, time will run out

862
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,918
[sighs] and then...

863
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:22,953
Uh, Kari!

864
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:34,131
-Uh, Himekawa! -I think she's okay.

865
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:36,233
It seems she just fainted.

866
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:38,035
No, she's not okay.

867
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,903
What even happened to her, anyway?

868
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:42,473
Oh, I'm not entirely sure yet but...

869
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,541
it appears that someone used her

870
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,111
as a conduit in order to deliver a message to you.

871
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:50,447
What do you think she meant by \"a sacrifice\"?

872
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,217
[Himekawa] Perhaps... a reboot.

873
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:54,551
What, a reboot?

874
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,954
Please tell me that's something you can eat.

875
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:59,223
Agumon, stop obsessing about food!

876
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,158
We believe that the digital world

877
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:03,193
is one of the many worlds that exists

878
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:06,096
side by side with our own, a sort of parallel universe.

879
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:08,298
As long as our world exists,

880
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:10,834
it's possible to restart the digital one.

881
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:14,104
-That's a reboot. -And what happens if we do that?

882
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:16,406
[Himekawa] Well, infected digimon

883
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,809
weren't originally part of the digital world.

884
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:21,512
So after a reboot, the infection would be gone.

885
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:28,118
If that's true, what are you waiting for already?

886
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:31,455
Rebooting's only a last resort.

887
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:33,157
[all] A last resort?

888
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:40,230
The quantum sea has created uncountable other worlds.

889
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:43,433
At the same time, it's different than all of them.

890
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,035
It's the primal world.

891
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:46,436
The progenitor.

892
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,338
An unplanned, uncontrolled reboot

893
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:50,374
could leave gaps in evolutions.

894
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:54,244
Or even destroy the entire digital world.

895
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,180
But...

896
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,384
[Gatomon] But we're already out of time.

897
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:01,652
[Himekawa] Yes.

898
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:03,620
If we just stand around and wait,

899
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:06,623
all the other worlds would be destroyed too.

900
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:08,625
In order to avoid that,

901
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:10,527
we must reboot.

902
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:13,397
[Gabumon] If we do this,

903
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:15,999
will Matt's world be okay?

904
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,903
[Himekawa] Only if every trace of infection has vanished

905
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:22,206
from this world when the reboot is initiated.

906
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,074
How do you know that?

907
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:26,643
I'm a high-ranking officer, that's how.

908
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:29,213
You're saying that this sacrifice

909
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:32,082
is basically turning back time in the digital world?

910
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:36,053
That's right. More or less.

911
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,421
How's it work?

912
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,389
This whole reboot thing?

913
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,225
I don't know exactly

914
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,527
but it all rests on one thing.

915
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,495
Homeostasis,

916
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:49,566
and if it truly wants stability across worlds.

917
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,934
Homeostasis?

918
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,669
I'm almost positive.

919
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:55,339
That's who just talked to you through Kari.

920
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:58,141
Maybe it's easiest to think of it

921
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:00,210
as a super being from the digital world.

922
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:02,312
[Agumon] There's nothing easy about that.

923
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:04,214
[Himekawa] In any event,

924
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:08,051
we believe it is seeking stability across worlds.

925
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:10,420
But Meicoomon's next appearance

926
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:13,090
could trigger a dangerous reboot.

927
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:17,127
[all gasp in fear]

928
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,697
Well, regardless of that,

929
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,366
I can't leave Kari here like this.

930
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:24,401
I'm driving her to the hospital.

931
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:26,003
What're you going to do?

932
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:29,573
-Huh-oh, we're coming along. -Hold on.

933
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,576
Are you... trustworthy?

934
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,681
Gatomon, what's wrong?

935
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:41,118
[Gatomon] We need to talk.

936
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:49,359
[sighs]

937
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:54,698
Ah!

938
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:57,034
[Agumon] So to talk,

939
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:59,202
don't we have to actually, you know, talk?

940
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:01,338
[Gatomon] Right, so about this reboot thing.

941
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:04,508
It would let us help out a lot of worlds right?

942
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:05,776
[Gatomon] You don't really understand

943
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:07,077
what would happen

944
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:08,679
if we turned back time in the digital world, do you?

945
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:10,147
[all] Not at all.

946
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,183
It isn't only the digital world that would get rebooted,

947
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:14,384
we would as well.

948
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,323
-Get it? -[all] Not even a bit.

949
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:23,160
It means... that we would lose all of our memories.

950
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,028
Our memories?

951
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:28,398
-What are those again? -Agumon, not time for jokes.

952
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:30,801
Hold on. Are you really saying

953
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:33,370
we'd forget everything that's happened to us?

954
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:35,205
-[Gatomon] That's right. -[all] Oh!

955
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:36,340
Everything?

956
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:39,176
You're telling me I'd even forget Mimi?

957
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:40,644
No way.

958
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:46,083
-But I don't wanna. -Me neither.

959
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,218
I can't forget TK!

960
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:51,088
Just the thought of it's even scarier than being erased!

961
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,789
This is a bad idea.

962
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,258
[Tentomon] Even worse than all our other bad ideas.

963
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:57,461
[Gatomon] Yes.

964
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:00,097
Losing our memories would be truly scary.

965
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,165
But really, the scariest thing

966
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:03,734
is that we wouldn't even know it happened

967
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:06,636
'cause we wouldn't be able to remember that we forgot.

968
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,205
[Tentomon] Is there anything we can do?

969
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:09,439
You heard Himekawa.

970
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,610
If Meicoomon shows up, she could trigger an uncontrolled reboot.

971
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:15,178
And that's the bad kind of bad.

972
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:17,614
Not the slightly better kind of bad she talked about.

973
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:21,284
Wait, if we caught Meicoomon, could we stop the reboot?

974
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:25,288
Yeah, I bet that we can if we can all just work together.

975
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,290
But what if we can't?

976
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:29,259
[all groan]

977
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:32,062
[Gatomon] Listen, no more feeling sorry for ourselves.

978
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:35,198
We wanna protect our partners and their world, right?

979
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:37,167
Then, this is how it's gotta be.

980
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:39,269
We've to prepare for the worst.

981
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,672
Great. Now I'm feeling sorry for myself again.

982
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,241
[Palmon] Gatomon...

983
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:48,111
Come on, guys. Let's not give up hope yet.

984
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:49,846
[all moan]

985
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:52,783
Izzy's trying everything he can.

986
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:56,453
I know, but if he can't figure it all out then...

987
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,555
He will. He has to.

988
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:00,457
He's working on it.

989
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:03,427
And Izzy won't stop until he finds the solution!

990
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:06,329
That's why... eeyeah...

991
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:07,731
Tentomon!

992
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:09,499
I know he can do it.

993
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:11,435
It's his only option.

994
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:13,437
I believe in him too.

995
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,640
But what if it's too late by the time he figures it out?

996
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:19,142
[all groan]

997
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:23,313
[Himekawa] Well, that's a relief.

998
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:24,781
Seems you're just a little anemic.

999
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:26,283
Yeah, but...

1000
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:28,652
I still don't understand what happened to me.

1001
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:32,222
Last thing I remember, I was walking down the hall at school,

1002
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,391
and next thing I know, I'm in the hospital.

1003
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,293
Well, I don't really know.

1004
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:38,228
I only found you after you fainted.

1005
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:41,698
With all that's been going on lately,

1006
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:44,868
you probably haven't been taking proper care of yourself.

1007
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:47,537
-[Kari] I guess... -I should drive you home.

1008
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:49,639
Oh, no! I'm okay, really.

1009
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,775
I left my bag at school.

1010
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:53,410
I gotta go back and get it.

1011
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,479
All right, well, see you soon.

1012
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:57,214
Thank you so much for all your help.

1013
00:51:58,849 --> 00:51:59,850
Hmm.

1014
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:10,227
[Himekawa sighs]

1015
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,762
We're all out of time.

1016
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:25,509
-[Gatomon] Kari! -Huh?

1017
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:27,644
Gatomon?

1018
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:33,683
Gatomon, something wrong?

1019
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:35,318
Aren't you supposed to be at Izzy's?

1020
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:36,386
No, it's okay.

1021
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:37,754
What do you mean, \"okay\"?

1022
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:40,257
Let's go do some shopping before we go home.

1023
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,660
Uh, shopping? What's going on? Are you all right?

1024
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:47,464
Don't worry about it.

1025
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,900
I-- I just want to spend some time with you.

1026
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:51,268
Sounds great.

1027
00:52:58,275 --> 00:52:59,276
Huh?

1028
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:03,914
Gabumon, what're you doing here? .

1029
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:05,682
I'm just saying hi.

1030
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,588
-[Gabumon] Hey, Matt. -Hmm?

1031
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:13,990
Could you play the harmonica for me?

1032
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,292
Harmonica?

1033
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:17,827
-Please. -Well, Gabumon...

1034
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:20,864
-I'm kinda practicing here. -[sighs] All right.

1035
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:25,302
-Is everything okay? -Oh, uh... yeah. Never mind.

1036
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,271
Gabumon?

1037
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:30,574
Just keep on practicing.

1038
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,817
Why'd you stop playing? Is something wrong?

1039
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,454
Are you done?

1040
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:48,825
I just thought I'd switch up the pace a little.

1041
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:50,393
[plays harmonica]

1042
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:10,480
[Sora] What is it?

1043
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:13,783
It's just... Sora,

1044
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:15,885
what do you want to do when you get older?

1045
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,355
[Sora] Huh? Where'd that come from?

1046
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:20,290
[Piyomon] I'm just curious about your future.

1047
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:23,593
There's way too much going on and now to worry about that.

1048
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:26,529
I mean, there's Izzy's health, the infected digimon...

1049
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:28,898
I want to hear about your secret hopes and dreams.

1050
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:32,435
Nah, I'll take a pass. That's way too grown up for me.

1051
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:33,903
Come on, please tell me.

1052
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:37,440
-Hmm, what do I dream of? -Yeah, yeah.

1053
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:39,342
[Sora] Nah, it's too embarrassing.

1054
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:40,710
[Piyomon] Oh, come on!

1055
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:43,313
You want me to meet your girlfriend?

1056
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,548
Oh, yeah. We're partners.

1057
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:48,318
So I want to make sure that you get a proper introduction.

1058
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:50,053
Partners, huh?

1059
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,555
Yeah, well, that's what we are.

1060
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:55,492
I gotta make sure my partners get to know each other, don't I?

1061
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:58,461
I mean, she might even become my life partner someday.

1062
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:00,730
[whimpers quietly]

1063
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:06,403
Okay. So what shall I wear? Something special like a suit?

1064
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:08,672
-My formal fur? -Formal fur?

1065
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:10,473
No, just be yourself.

1066
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:12,676
Don't change a thing. You got me?

1067
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:13,977
All right, sure.

1068
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:16,780
But for the record, I wanna know one thing.

1069
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,682
Yeah, sure. Like what?

1070
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:20,917
How we met? Or how we fell in love?

1071
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:23,119
Or how she fills my heart with pure joy--

1072
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,622
Can other people actually see her?

1073
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,457
[Joe] Hey, she's really real.

1074
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,558
For real.

1075
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,435
-Kari! -Hm?

1076
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:39,469
Kari! Look at that.

1077
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:41,471
[Gatomon] So many types of ice cream.

1078
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:43,006
You want some?

1079
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:44,074
Uh-huh.

1080
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,444
[Gatomon] Hey, don't forget me. Pass it.

1081
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:48,511
[Kari giggles]

1082
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:50,647
[Gatomon] Now that's good ice cream.

1083
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,848
I mean, is it ever bad?

1084
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:55,885
-Hey, Kari? -Hmm?

1085
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,620
[Gatomon] Look, a photo booth.

1086
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:01,991
-Can we take pictures? -Okay, if you want.

1087
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:03,626
You don't?

1088
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,729
No, come on, let’s go do it.

1089
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:07,664
[Gatomon] Great one. That one, too.

1090
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:10,700
That could be better. There, better.

1091
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:15,972
[Gatomon giggles]

1092
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:24,748
So she says, \"I got this beautiful pot of flowers, right?

1093
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:27,016
And I have been watering them every day.

1094
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,218
Two times a day.

1095
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:29,152
But they're not growing.\"

1096
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:32,155
Well, get this, Palmon, they are plastic!

1097
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,224
-Huh? -Uh...

1098
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:36,659
I thought that was... funny, right?

1099
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,663
Oh! Yeah, totally. Really great story.

1100
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:42,799
In fact, it was hysterical!

1101
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:44,968
-Wait, what happened? -Uh?

1102
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:48,772
[Mimi] Oh, good one, Palmon. You are so funny. [chuckles]

1103
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:50,707
[Palmon] Hysterical, right?

1104
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,910
[Agumon] Come on, Tai, let's go play soccer.

1105
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:56,112
-Soccer? -And then video games.

1106
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:57,914
And then lunch, and then some more lunch

1107
00:56:57,947 --> 00:56:59,916
and then lunch on the side, I love lunch.

1108
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:01,885
-Do you like lunch? -[Tai] What's up with you?

1109
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:05,088
Oh, nothing. Can't I just be excited for no reason?

1110
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:06,923
[Tai] Did you get into the coffee again?

1111
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:08,792
Oh, come on, Tai.

1112
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:09,893
Let's hang out.

1113
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:12,462
Seriously, are you okay?

1114
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:15,532
All I want is to spend some time with you.

1115
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:16,966
Agumon?

1116
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,003
It's not like it's the end of the world or anything.

1117
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:22,105
Um, forget I said that.

1118
00:57:22,138 --> 00:57:24,841
[Tai] You're acting weird. Well, weirder.

1119
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:26,776
[Agumon] I don't know the meaning of the word.

1120
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:28,812
[Tai] You don't have to know it to be it.

1121
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:31,147
Just tell me what's going on.

1122
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:33,116
You're making me more nervous than normal.

1123
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,485
Um, it's nothing.

1124
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:37,020
Come on.

1125
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:39,155
Huh?

1126
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:42,992
I just wanna play.

1127
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:45,962
[TK] Oh, Patamon.

1128
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:49,499
I just wish there was something I could do.

1129
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:54,037
[Patamon whining]

1130
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,608
[sighs]

1131
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:01,711
[Patamon] Just being with you helps me.

1132
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:04,714
You can squish me all you want.

1133
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:09,719
Don't tell anyone I told you.

1134
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,088
A reboot?

1135
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:14,224
Don't worry, Tai.

1136
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:17,594
Everything's gonna be okay once we stop Meicoomon.

1137
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:21,097
We'll be just the way we used to be. Right Tai?

1138
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:23,233
Tai?

1139
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:27,737
[Tai] No, Agumon.

1140
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:36,579
So, Matt, what're you thinking about?

1141
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,681
I'd like to go back in time.

1142
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:39,716
[Gabumon] Uh?

1143
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:43,653
I know. I rarely think like this.

1144
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:46,823
But I just wonder...

1145
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:51,828
What if... my memories are all wrong, huh?

1146
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:54,998
I was so young.

1147
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,799
I could've made things up.

1148
00:58:57,834 --> 00:58:58,935
What if...

1149
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:01,004
nothing happened like I thought.

1150
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:03,172
Everything happened.

1151
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:08,645
It was all real.

1152
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:12,682
[sighs]

1153
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:14,083
[plays harmonica]

1154
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:37,774
[Izzy] These errors keep popping up in the code.

1155
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:40,143
They seem to be the root of all this.

1156
00:59:40,944 --> 00:59:42,078
[Tentomon] Did you find something?

1157
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:46,182
[Izzy] Well, our world's digital devices work on a binary code

1158
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:49,085
or with other systems that can be converted to binary.

1159
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:51,387
But somehow some got hacked

1160
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:54,023
and overwritten in an unknown numerical system.

1161
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:58,027
So computers around the world are getting viruses.

1162
00:59:58,061 --> 00:59:59,228
[Tentomon] Oh, no!

1163
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:00,730
[Izzy] This new code

1164
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,865
doesn't seem to be based in a binary system,

1165
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:06,035
a decimal system or even a hexadecimal system.

1166
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:09,672
Our electronic devices can't recognize it.

1167
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:11,774
That's why we can't see it with our goggles.

1168
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:14,043
If I'd known this sooner,

1169
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:17,046
I could have come up with a plan to decode it. But...

1170
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:20,149
without the base, there's nothing I can do.

1171
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:22,952
Maybe it's possible to convert

1172
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:24,821
the data into something readable.

1173
01:00:24,854 --> 01:00:26,122
But one mistake could cause

1174
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:27,924
every computer and electronic device

1175
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,392
worldwide to shut down.

1176
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:32,195
And even if I knew the code's base,

1177
01:00:32,228 --> 01:00:33,863
what could I do about it now?

1178
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:36,432
My own computer, one that I programmed myself,

1179
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:37,900
is being overwritten.

1180
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:41,337
This is pointless.

1181
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:44,007
I'm just staring at the screen.

1182
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:46,309
Not getting anywhere.

1183
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:50,446
-I feel so useless! Aargh! -[electronic beeping]

1184
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,916
I'm a fool. A useless fool!

1185
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,419
All the time I've spent working on this...

1186
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:58,421
And for what?

1187
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:02,091
I'm just... useless. Useless...

1188
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:05,028
[sobs]

1189
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:07,997
Izzy, I don't mean to interrupt your meltdown but

1190
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:10,767
you shouldn't feel so bad that you haven't found the solution.

1191
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,869
But, this is a disaster.

1192
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,204
And I can't figure a way out.

1193
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:17,140
[Tentomon] Well, one thing I know about you is that

1194
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,008
you are able to achieve great things

1195
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:21,144
because of your great persistence.

1196
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:25,248
You're driven by the opportunity to make things better.

1197
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:26,916
I even think you're happiest

1198
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:28,184
when you're learning something new.

1199
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:31,854
Because you have the ability to see not only what something is,

1200
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:33,256
but how great it can be.

1201
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:34,991
But since you've become focused

1202
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:36,893
on what's bad instead of what's good,

1203
01:01:36,926 --> 01:01:39,062
your work doesn't make you happy anymore.

1204
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:40,263
Of course it doesn't.

1205
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:42,365
I feel like I've been going in circles.

1206
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,001
Uh, I'm sorry.

1207
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:48,905
I'm sorry. I hate to see you so miserable.

1208
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:50,873
It must be hard to keep starting over.

1209
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:53,342
-Tentomon, you... -[sighs]

1210
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:56,179
Looks like there's only one thing to do.

1211
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:57,246
[Izzy] What?

1212
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:01,050
A reboot?

1213
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:03,986
[Tentomon] We digimon can't do it on our own.

1214
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,254
But if it comes to that,

1215
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:09,292
then we're prepared to do what needs to be done.

1216
01:02:11,427 --> 01:02:13,996
[Izzy] A reboot would fix all our issues.

1217
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:15,798
Okay, I've got a plan.

1218
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,301
Now, I just have to get it done.

1219
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:21,304
All right. I gotta work fast.

1220
01:02:21,604 --> 01:02:23,239
I can solve this.

1221
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:25,508
I know you can, Izzy.

1222
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:27,110
I believe in you.

1223
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:28,945
I guess you believe in you too.

1224
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:30,513
Just look at you go.

1225
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,482
Now that's my Izzy.

Always full of hope

1227

01:08:11,887 --> 01:08:13,289
But, TK...

1303
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:15,491
Patamon, if you go,

1304
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:17,126
then you're gonna...

1305
01:08:17,893 --> 01:08:19,361
Are you kidding?

1306
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:21,263
It's okay.

1307
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:25,167
[TK] No, you have to stay here with me!

1308
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:27,470
[Patamon] But I gotta and you know it!

1309
01:08:27,503 --> 01:08:30,439
We digimon have to protect your world.

1310
01:08:30,973 --> 01:08:32,374
[TK] Patamon...

1311
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:36,312
And that's why I came here in the first place, you know.

1312
01:08:36,345 --> 01:08:38,681
But I... I can't...

1313
01:08:38,714 --> 01:08:39,882
[Patamon] TK.

1314
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,554
See you soon.

1315
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:48,224
[yells] Patamon!

1316
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:06,275
Patamon digivolve to!

1317
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:29,198
Angemon!

1318
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:46,282
Mei, I'm here for you!

1319
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:48,951
Please listen to me! Please!

1320
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:55,357
[roaring and screaming with rage]

1321
01:09:55,758 --> 01:09:56,992
What can I do?

1322
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:59,828
It's hopeless! Oh, Mei!

1323
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:01,764
What's this energy spike?

1324
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:04,567
It's totally different

1325
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,435
than the data from the other distortions.

1326
01:10:06,902 --> 01:10:08,737
Why did it appear with Meicoomon?

1327
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:11,373
Unbelievable!

1328
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:12,575
You find something?

1329
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,644
All of these strange events began

1330
01:10:15,911 --> 01:10:18,847
when Meiko and Meicoomon moved to town.

1331
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:21,350
Of course! What's that mean exactly?

1332
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:22,985
[Izzy] Maybe Meicoomon

1333
01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:25,721
didn't catch the infection from another digimon,

1334
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:27,690
Maybe it was caused by Meiko.

1335
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:28,891
[Tentomon] Meiko? Seriously?

1336
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:30,826
I'm not entirely certain

1337
01:10:31,026 --> 01:10:33,295
but it does fit the observed data.

1338
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:36,665
Listen, Izzy, we gotta get down there and help out right now.

1339
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:38,701
I know. I'm just about done.

1340
01:10:39,034 --> 01:10:40,970
I just gotta load this on to my laptop.

1341
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:45,007
[Meicoomon screaming]

1342
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:55,884
Angemon!

1343
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:56,986
[Angemon groans]

1344
01:10:57,519 --> 01:10:59,054
-Angemon! -It's too dangerous.

1345
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,624
-But he might be hurt! -Did you see that?

1346
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:04,493
Yeah, I did. He's infected.

1347
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:18,841
-Angemon! -I knew it.

1348
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:21,043
He's infected.

1349
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:26,548
No, you don't!

1350
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:30,019
Nice!

1351
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:47,436
[Kari] Angemon and Angewomon are fighting each other?

1352
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,805
I can't believe this is happening!

1353
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:51,040
Why would they do that?

1354
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:53,375
They've always been on the same side.

1355
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:57,046
But, that means, Togemon could be in trouble too.

1356
01:11:57,579 --> 01:11:58,981
What if she gets infected next?

1357
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:04,119
Oh, no! Togemon!

1358
01:12:11,093 --> 01:12:13,128
[screaming]

1359
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:17,666
[Kari] TK.

1360
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:19,501
Angemon...

1361
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:23,906
-You guys! -Izzy!

1362
01:12:24,606 --> 01:12:25,808
Where's Meicoomon?

1363
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:28,544
Our digimon are trying to push her through the distortion.

1364
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:31,046
Rain!

1365
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:38,087
[screaming in pain]

1366
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,688
Oh, no! Birdramon!

1367
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,395
-Garurumon! -Togemon!

1368
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:48,530
Oh, no! They've all got it!

1369
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:13,088
Angewomon too?

1370
01:13:14,123 --> 01:13:15,991
The infection is spreading faster

1371
01:13:16,191 --> 01:13:17,392
and at this rate,

1372
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:20,729
the number of digimon getting compromised might multiply.

1373
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:22,765
If that happens...

1374
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:47,990
Greymon digivolve to!

1375
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:03,238
MetalGreymon!

1376
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:08,877
[screaming and groaning]

1377
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:17,152
-What's happening? -Some kind of countdown.

1378
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:18,587
To what?

1379
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:20,222
The reboot!

1380
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:21,924
[all] The reboot?

1381
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:24,593
What's that mean? What's going on?

1382
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:27,863
Gatomon never talked about anything like that.

1383
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:36,738
That would mean our digimon'd have their memories erased.

1384
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,008
[Joe] You mean they'll even forget us?

1385
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:43,011
-Yeah. -No way! Try something else!

1386
01:14:43,612 --> 01:14:45,881
Actually I do have a plan B.

1387
01:14:46,281 --> 01:14:47,616
You do?

1388
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:50,853
[roaring]

1389
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:58,727
-Izzy, I need to fight too. -Hold on.

1390
01:15:06,034 --> 01:15:08,003
[Izzy] I can get data for a backup

1391
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:09,771
if our digimon go into that cube.

1392
01:15:10,772 --> 01:15:11,974
What do you mean 'backup'?

1393
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:14,109
I mean, copies of the original file

1394
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:15,210
and if I have them

1395
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:17,946
I can sort out the data corrupted by the infection.

1396
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,049
Tentomon, go and help MetalGreymon

1397
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:23,151
get everyone pushed into the backup field.

1398
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:24,586
You got it!

1399
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,903
Tentomon digivolve to!

1400
01:16:00,255 --> 01:16:03,759
Kabuterimon!

1401
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:06,261
[Sora] Come on, you guys!

1402
01:16:06,295 --> 01:16:09,965
You have to save everyone! You can!

1403
01:16:29,017 --> 01:16:30,819
MetalGreymon!

1404
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:43,065
[groaning]

1405
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:09,324
[Izzy] Tentomon!

1406
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:11,393
[gasp in shock]

1407
01:17:12,427 --> 01:17:14,763
Tentomon, you gotta get into that backup field.

1408
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:17,432
-Alone if you have to. -[Tentomon] No can do.

1409
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:19,267
What's the matter with you!

1410
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:27,776
I'm sorry, Izzy, but I can't.

1411
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:29,778
The other digimon are already out there

1412
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:32,381
risking their hides to stop Meicoomon.

1413
01:17:33,448 --> 01:17:36,985
I can't stay in here doing nothing just to save myself!

1414
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:38,754
Tentomon...

1415
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:40,922
[Tentomon] Izzy, when we first met,

1416
01:17:40,956 --> 01:17:42,991
I didn't know you from Adam,

1417
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:44,426
and I still don't know who that is,

1418
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:47,295
but getting to know you over the years

1419
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:50,365
has been the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.

1420
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:52,834
If my memories get erased,

1421
01:17:52,868 --> 01:17:55,037
we'll just have to make new ones together, right?

1422
01:17:55,537 --> 01:17:58,040
-Wait... -No matter what happens...

1423
01:17:58,373 --> 01:18:03,245
promise me, you'll hold on to your love of learning, okay?

1424
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:06,081
Stop this.

1425
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:08,450
[Tentomon] Sorry I couldn't give you more of a heads up!

1426
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:10,152
Tentomon!

1427
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:11,453
Goodbye, Izzy!

1428
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:13,422
It's been a pleasure.

1429
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:36,044
Kabuterimon digivolve to!

1430
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:49,357
MegaKabuterimon!

1431
01:18:49,591 --> 01:18:51,893
Once I get a hold of you,

1432
01:18:52,194 --> 01:18:55,097
I'm not going to let go!

1433
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:57,332
[grunting]

1434
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:03,472
Listen up!

1435
01:19:07,175 --> 01:19:11,113
MegaKabuterimon digivolve to!

1436
01:19:24,926 --> 01:19:28,396
HerculesKabuterimon!

1437
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:43,545
[screaming]

1438
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:58,927
Is this it?

1439
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,597
Is it really time for me to say goodbye?

1440
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:06,535
Everyone is going to be so very sad!

1441
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:10,839
Open your eyes!

1442
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,915
Thank you!

1443
01:20:25,954 --> 01:20:31,159
[electronic ticking]

1444
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:38,533
[continuous beep]

1445
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:03,558
[Patamon] Don't forget me, TK!

1446
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:23,678
[TK] I think Patamon...

1447
01:21:24,279 --> 01:21:26,448
was the first one to catch it.

1448
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:28,450
But...

1449
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:30,952
I just couldn't bring myself to tell you guys.

1450
01:21:31,586 --> 01:21:32,587
Because...

1451
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:34,289
I was so afraid.

1452
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:39,628
Good morning, everybody.

1453
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:42,230
Summer is upon us and the season started with

1454
01:21:42,264 --> 01:21:44,666
record breaking turnouts at our amusement parks.

1455
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:48,103
There's been a steady flow of students and families

1456
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:49,671
coming in since early this morning.

1457
01:21:50,272 --> 01:21:53,041
The forecast calls for nothing but blue skies

1458
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:55,076
and unusually warm weather.

1459
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:57,412
So this should be a very pleasant day.

1460
01:21:57,445 --> 01:21:59,714
I hope that everyone's able to enjoy it.

1461
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:01,349
We certainly intend to.

1462
01:22:01,549 --> 01:22:03,118
-[children laughing] -[child 1] Take that!

1463
01:22:03,485 --> 01:22:04,653
[lifeguard] No splashing.

1464
01:22:10,392 --> 01:22:12,394
[Himekawa] It's been a whole week now.

1465
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:14,629
And we've yet to see any signs of disturbance

1466
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:17,132
in the digital world from the quantum sea.

1467
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:19,401
[man] Seems so.

1468
01:22:27,509 --> 01:22:30,211
But there's a very good reason for that, you know.

1469
01:22:31,513 --> 01:22:32,981
[Himekawa] I know.

1470
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:45,460
[Himekawa] The kids are just going to have to move on

1471
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:47,262
and put all this behind them.

1472
01:22:53,068 --> 01:22:55,036
It had to happen eventually.

1473
01:23:06,448 --> 01:23:07,716
[Himekawa] Before we know it,

1474
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:10,185
there will be new buildings sprouting up.

1475
01:23:10,218 --> 01:23:11,419
In six months from now,

1476
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:14,589
this place will look just like it did before all this started.

1477
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:16,391
Within a year,

1478
01:23:16,424 --> 01:23:18,793
everyone will have forgotten that it happened at all.

1479
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:21,129
No one will give a second thought

1480
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:22,630
to anything about digimon.

1481
01:23:23,131 --> 01:23:25,033
If they even remember what they are.

1482
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:29,104
[man] What about the kids?

1483
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,008
[Himekawa] They'll just...

1484
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:35,643
have to say goodbye to that part of their childhood.

1485
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:51,226
[Izzy] Any news on the digital world?

1486
01:23:53,294 --> 01:23:55,096
Have the digidevices rebooted?

1487
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:58,633
When the digital world rebooted,

1488
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:00,368
it was supposed to revert to its state

1489
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:01,636
prior to the distortions

1490
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:04,239
and the digidevices should have followed suit.

1491
01:24:04,272 --> 01:24:05,840
We're gonna have to find another way.

1492
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:09,110
-[TK] What's plan B then? -What do you mean?

1493
01:24:09,144 --> 01:24:10,745
Even if find our digimon...

1494
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:12,313
they won't remember us.

1495
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:15,150
And what do we say?

1496
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:17,485
When it came down to it,

1497
01:24:18,286 --> 01:24:20,121
I couldn't even protect my own partner.

1498
01:24:20,688 --> 01:24:22,624
I was helpless to save Patamon.

1499
01:24:23,324 --> 01:24:25,326
[Izzy] So what do you think we should do, TK?

1500
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:28,263
Mope around and try to forget them?

1501
01:24:28,596 --> 01:24:30,698
This isn't about what you couldn't do in the past,

1502
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:33,201
this is about what you're going to do now.

1503
01:24:34,202 --> 01:24:35,503
[Izzy typing]

1504
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:47,842
[Himekawa] Izumi?

1505
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:57,418
[Meiko] It's Mimi.

1506
01:25:58,286 --> 01:26:00,355
Got caught in the rain again.

1507
01:26:06,561 --> 01:26:08,463
[Izzy] Don't you want to see them again?

1508
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:11,199
Yeah, of course.

1509
01:26:11,699 --> 01:26:13,234
They're our partners.

1510
01:26:14,602 --> 01:26:15,970
Maybe someday...

1511
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:17,305
[whistle]

1512
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:27,248
Agumon...

1513
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:30,485
Hey! Tai!

1514
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:05,620
[Tai] You know, you guys...

1515
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:08,957
if we keep waiting for this mythical someday,

1516
01:27:10,024 --> 01:27:13,261
we'll be old and grey before we see our partners again.

1517
01:27:14,696 --> 01:27:15,863
[Izzy] Exactly.

1518
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:20,768
Then let's go.

1519
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:37,552
[doorbell peals]

1520
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:40,388
[Meiko] TK...

1521
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:44,959
-Are you serious? -[Tai] Absolutely.

1522
01:27:45,393 --> 01:27:46,628
You'd better be sure.

1523
01:27:46,661 --> 01:27:49,097
Once we open the gate, it could be unstable.

1524
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:50,698
You may not be able to come back.

1525
01:27:50,732 --> 01:27:52,300
[Daigo] It's too dangerous.

1526
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:55,803
You guys, don't be foolish. We have to discuss this.

1527
01:27:56,004 --> 01:27:58,072
-I'm going. -But Matt...

1528
01:27:58,473 --> 01:28:00,842
Look, there's no point in freaking out about it.

1529
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:02,543
I mean we did the same thing

1530
01:28:02,577 --> 01:28:04,112
when we were back in elementary school.

1531
01:28:04,145 --> 01:28:05,380
That's right.

1532
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:08,116
We're older now. We know the risks.

1533
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:09,350
All right, then.

1534
01:28:10,251 --> 01:28:11,519
I'll set up where the reboot occurred.

1535
01:28:11,552 --> 01:28:12,654
Hime...

1536
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:15,890
Nishijima, take them to the site.

1537
01:28:15,923 --> 01:28:17,892
I'll contact security and distract them.

1538
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:24,599
[Daigo] Are you guys really sure this is what you want.

1539
01:28:24,632 --> 01:28:25,700
[all] Uh-huh.

1540
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:34,108
[Meiko] You know that I can't join you.

1541
01:28:35,043 --> 01:28:36,544
[TK] Why not?

1542
01:28:36,577 --> 01:28:38,813
Because I don't have the right to go.

1543
01:28:38,846 --> 01:28:41,983
-What's that supposed to mean? -This was Mei's fault.

1544
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:43,885
Well, Mei's and mine I guess.

1545
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:45,853
How is it Meicoomon's fault?

1546
01:28:48,189 --> 01:28:50,892
Because Mei was the source of the infection.

1547
01:29:16,617 --> 01:29:19,921
[Mei] Mei... Mei... co...

1548
01:29:22,223 --> 01:29:23,758
Meiko...

1549
01:29:26,594 --> 01:29:27,862
[giggles]

1550
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:39,407
And that is how I first met Mei.

1551
01:29:39,941 --> 01:29:43,144
My dad was working as a digimon researcher then.

1552
01:29:44,145 --> 01:29:47,815
He told me that Mei was an extra special digimon.

1553
01:29:48,483 --> 01:29:49,851
I heard some rumors,

1554
01:29:49,884 --> 01:29:52,553
but I never knew exactly why she was special.

1555
01:29:53,121 --> 01:29:55,623
I never expected things to turn out like this.

1556
01:29:56,157 --> 01:29:57,892
I wanted to say something,

1557
01:29:58,659 --> 01:30:00,661
but I... I just...

1558
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:03,431
I... couldn't bring myself

1559
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:05,099
to actually do it.

1560
01:30:05,133 --> 01:30:06,701
I... I...

1561
01:30:16,544 --> 01:30:17,812
But TK,

1562
01:30:19,013 --> 01:30:22,083
I don't want to make everyone sad, you know.

1563
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,588
I know how hard all of this has been for you.

1564
01:30:29,056 --> 01:30:30,491
Forget about blame.

1565
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:31,926
What's done is done.

1566
01:30:31,959 --> 01:30:33,594
It's what we do next that matters.

1567
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:37,131
And I say what we should do is...

1568
01:30:37,532 --> 01:30:40,501
-go find our partners so we-- -Stop being nice to me!

1569
01:30:41,202 --> 01:30:43,838
I can't handle it. Don't sugarcoat it.

1570
01:30:44,038 --> 01:30:45,706
Just be honest and blame me!

1571
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:47,608
Be angry, I deserve it!

1572
01:30:47,942 --> 01:30:49,844
Meiko! Stop!

1573
01:30:50,244 --> 01:30:53,481
[Meiko] I'm sorry but this isn't just hard for me...

1574
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:57,718
it's all just so...

1575
01:30:58,052 --> 01:30:59,554
horrible.

1576
01:31:01,756 --> 01:31:04,559
At least, it does feel good

1577
01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:06,994
to finally say it out loud to someone.

1578
01:31:07,028 --> 01:31:08,262
It's true. [sobs]

1579
01:31:08,863 --> 01:31:10,665
I feel relieved,

1580
01:31:11,032 --> 01:31:12,900
now that I've confessed.

1581
01:31:13,668 --> 01:31:17,672
I have no right to see the digimon, none at all!

1582
01:31:18,005 --> 01:31:20,641
Just... Just leave me alone. [sobbing]

1583
01:31:22,243 --> 01:31:23,678
[TK] I'm sorry, Meiko.

1584
01:31:23,711 --> 01:31:25,046
I can't do that.

1585
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:26,647
We're in this together.

1586
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:30,918
I mean... you're Meicoomon's partner.

1587
01:31:31,786 --> 01:31:32,987
But more than that...

1588
01:31:34,021 --> 01:31:35,256
you're one of us.

1589
01:31:38,092 --> 01:31:39,227
When you're ready...

1590
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:40,761
we'll be waiting.

1591
01:31:43,598 --> 01:31:44,732
[sobbing]

1592
01:31:49,737 --> 01:31:51,906
So you're saying that all along

1593
01:31:52,206 --> 01:31:54,575
[Joe] Meicoomon was the source of the infection?

1594
01:31:55,009 --> 01:31:56,310
Did your agency know?

1595
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:58,646
I didn't. I would have told you.

1596
01:31:59,914 --> 01:32:02,216
Oh, Meimei, it's awful.

1597
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:04,919
Well, maybe if she'd clued us in earlier...

1598
01:32:04,952 --> 01:32:06,854
You think you could've done it, Joe?

1599
01:32:08,956 --> 01:32:10,191
'Cause I know...

1600
01:32:10,224 --> 01:32:11,759
that I couldn't.

1601
01:32:13,227 --> 01:32:15,162
It's harder than you think.

1602
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:17,064
Much harder.

1603
01:32:18,165 --> 01:32:20,902
I knew Patamon was infected but I couldn't tell you.

1604
01:32:22,803 --> 01:32:24,071
[Joe] You have a point.

1605
01:32:25,773 --> 01:32:27,008
Are those coordinates where

1606
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:28,743
our partners are in the digital world?

1607
01:32:28,776 --> 01:32:30,711
I think so. I scrubbed the data

1608
01:32:30,745 --> 01:32:32,647
and got intel from Agent Himekawa.

1609
01:32:34,982 --> 01:32:36,984
[quiet whirring]

1610
01:32:37,785 --> 01:32:38,819
Uh-huh.

1611
01:32:47,128 --> 01:32:49,363
Agent Himekawa, what's she doing here?

1612
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:52,833
[Sora] A D-three?

1613
01:32:52,867 --> 01:32:54,168
This is all theoretical

1614
01:32:54,201 --> 01:32:56,237
which is scientist talk for 'don't have a clue'.

1615
01:32:56,837 --> 01:32:59,240
But if the data that's on this D-three,

1616
01:32:59,707 --> 01:33:01,375
can be synced up with your own power,

1617
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:04,011
it very well might be possible to open a gateway.

1618
01:33:04,045 --> 01:33:05,246
What power is that?

1619
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,248
[Himekawa] The power that exists

1620
01:33:07,448 --> 01:33:09,283
within each of your digital crests.

1621
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:44,085
[TK] I guess this is it.

1622
01:33:45,019 --> 01:33:46,654
[Daigo] Be careful, guys.

1623
01:33:48,222 --> 01:33:49,323
What's wrong?

1624
01:33:49,757 --> 01:33:51,258
[Sora] Well, it's sort of scary.

1625
01:33:54,161 --> 01:33:56,697
[Joe] You know, I've been thinking about this moment

1626
01:33:56,731 --> 01:33:58,699
since the first time I saw Gomamon.

1627
01:33:59,066 --> 01:34:00,768
I've got to be brave,

1628
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:03,104
or else he'll never stop making fun of me.

1629
01:34:04,105 --> 01:34:05,272
[Matt] It'll be okay.

1630
01:34:31,932 --> 01:34:33,000
[Meiko gasps]

1631
01:34:40,274 --> 01:34:41,375
[glass shatters]

1632
01:34:42,209 --> 01:34:44,111
[Mei] I'm sorry, Meiko.

1633
01:34:44,412 --> 01:34:46,747
[Meiko] Don't touch the glass, it's dangerous.

1634
01:34:47,148 --> 01:34:48,749
You don't want to get cut, do you?

1635
01:34:49,917 --> 01:34:51,152
[gasps in pain]

1636
01:34:51,786 --> 01:34:54,121
Oh, no! Meiko, you're hurt!

1637
01:34:54,355 --> 01:34:56,457
It's okay. It's just a scratch.

1638
01:34:58,259 --> 01:35:00,394
You see, it's all better already.

1639
01:35:00,428 --> 01:35:01,495
[Mei] Does it hurt?

1640
01:35:01,962 --> 01:35:03,798
Not at all. It's totally fine.

1641
01:35:03,831 --> 01:35:06,367
[Mei] I'm so sorry, Meiko. I didn't mean to do it.

1642
01:35:07,101 --> 01:35:08,803
You got hurt because of me.

1643
01:35:08,836 --> 01:35:11,439
No big deal. Besides I'm pretty tough.

1644
01:35:12,139 --> 01:35:14,842
Thanks. I love you, Meiko.

1645
01:35:15,943 --> 01:35:16,977
Mei...

1646
01:35:17,378 --> 01:35:18,512
[buzzer]

1647
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:24,118
[Meiko panting]

1648
01:35:35,362 --> 01:35:36,397
Uh...

1649
01:35:39,133 --> 01:35:41,035
[Tai] It all looks exactly the same.

1650
01:35:41,402 --> 01:35:44,038
[Mimi] Yeah, that thingy is just like that thingy.

1651
01:35:44,071 --> 01:35:46,273
[Izzy] Well, the digital world may have been rebooted,

1652
01:35:46,307 --> 01:35:48,909
but it's fundamental structure remains the same.

1653
01:35:49,477 --> 01:35:52,012
-Although... -What's wrong?

1654
01:35:52,046 --> 01:35:54,181
Something... just feels off.

1655
01:35:54,515 --> 01:35:56,383
-How so? -I'm not sure.

1656
01:35:56,584 --> 01:35:58,986
-But something is different. -I agree.

1657
01:35:59,253 --> 01:36:00,454
[Matt] Different how?

1658
01:36:00,488 --> 01:36:02,890
I don't know. It feels weird.

1659
01:36:02,923 --> 01:36:04,225
[all sighing]

1660
01:36:05,025 --> 01:36:07,194
[Matt] Well, let's go see what we can find out.

1661
01:36:11,632 --> 01:36:13,100
[Sora] So far...

1662
01:36:13,134 --> 01:36:15,469
all we've found out is that we're out of shape.

1663
01:36:15,503 --> 01:36:16,537
[Matt] Speak for yourself.

1664
01:36:16,570 --> 01:36:19,507
'Cause I'm too out of breath to speak for myself.

1665
01:36:20,174 --> 01:36:22,276
[Joe] At least we didn't find what we usually find.

1666
01:36:22,576 --> 01:36:24,111
Trouble, pain and terror.

1667
01:36:24,411 --> 01:36:25,980
-[lightning] -[Joe] Or maybe we did!

1668
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:28,582
[loud explosion]

1669
01:36:29,950 --> 01:36:31,952
[roars]

1670
01:36:31,986 --> 01:36:33,020
Alphamon!

1671
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:38,459
[Matt] There's another one.

1672
01:36:46,066 --> 01:36:48,269
Who is that guy? I've never seen him before.

1673
01:36:56,610 --> 01:36:57,878
[Joe] Just like old times!

1674
01:37:11,625 --> 01:37:14,094
[all screaming]

1675
01:37:18,532 --> 01:37:22,002
[TK] Well, we got through that like we always do, barely.

1676
01:37:22,369 --> 01:37:24,205
Did you see that new digimon?

1677
01:37:24,471 --> 01:37:26,106
I wonder who he is?

1678
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:28,042
Pretty sure he's Alphamon's enemy.

1679
01:37:28,409 --> 01:37:30,044
I need more than that.

1680
01:37:30,077 --> 01:37:32,546
-[computer beeps] -Aha, Jesmon.

1681
01:37:33,314 --> 01:37:34,515
What're you thinking?

1682
01:37:35,716 --> 01:37:37,484
Just that both of those guys appear to be ultimate level.

1683
01:37:37,718 --> 01:37:39,119
Yeah, they did.

1684
01:37:40,254 --> 01:37:41,488
I thought that all the digimon would have reverted to

1685
01:37:41,522 --> 01:37:43,257
digieggs after the reboot?

1686
01:37:43,490 --> 01:37:46,126
Is it possible they escaped the reboot?

1687
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:49,396
And then they somehow managed to digivolve to ultimate level?

1688
01:37:49,964 --> 01:37:51,532
Well, what are we supposed to do

1689
01:37:51,565 --> 01:37:54,368
if one of those digimon comes after us next time?

1690
01:37:55,169 --> 01:37:57,037
-Palmon and the others aren't-- -[muted whistling]

1691
01:37:57,071 --> 01:37:58,305
Shh.

1692
01:37:58,339 --> 01:37:59,373
What's up?

1693
01:38:01,008 --> 01:38:02,509
-You hear that? -Huh?

1694
01:38:03,377 --> 01:38:06,947
[whistling]

1695
01:38:07,248 --> 01:38:08,649
Sounds like a whistle.

1696
01:38:09,049 --> 01:38:10,718
[all sigh]

1697
01:38:10,751 --> 01:38:12,519
[Matt] Ah, why are we running again?

1698
01:38:14,255 --> 01:38:16,156
-[whistling] -[Matt] Just up ahead.

1699
01:38:16,991 --> 01:38:19,226
[all panting]

1700
01:38:20,194 --> 01:38:23,564
[whistling continues]

1701
01:38:24,632 --> 01:38:25,933
[TK] Togemon...

1702
01:38:29,503 --> 01:38:33,407
[childish sounds]

1703
01:38:35,109 --> 01:38:36,176
[Tai] Gomamon...

1704
01:38:36,377 --> 01:38:37,511
Who are you?

1705
01:38:37,544 --> 01:38:38,679
[both] Uh?

1706
01:38:41,682 --> 01:38:42,983
[all gasping]

1707
01:38:44,585 --> 01:38:46,186
[whistling]

1708
01:38:46,220 --> 01:38:47,688
Come on, give it back.

1709
01:38:47,721 --> 01:38:50,424
I'll give it back later when I'm done playing with it.

1710
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:53,661
Awesome, but what's the deal with the whistle?

1711
01:38:53,694 --> 01:38:55,429
I wanna play! I wanna play!

1712
01:38:57,298 --> 01:38:58,666
It sounds pretty.

1713
01:38:59,133 --> 01:39:01,402
Just let me play with it a little while longer.

1714
01:39:02,303 --> 01:39:05,139
[whistling]

1715
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:07,408
-[Sora] Yokomon! -[digimon squeal in fear]

1716
01:39:09,276 --> 01:39:10,277
Who are you?

1717
01:39:17,284 --> 01:39:18,485
[whimpers quietly]

1718
01:39:20,754 --> 01:39:22,089
Hello there.

1719
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:25,192
And what's your name? I'm new around here.

1720
01:39:25,559 --> 01:39:27,561
I'd love to learn more about your world'

1721
01:39:27,594 --> 01:39:29,263
'cause it's really prodigious.

1722
01:39:29,496 --> 01:39:31,365
Would you tell me about it please?

1723
01:39:48,449 --> 01:39:50,317
[stranger] What a touching reunion!

1724
01:39:56,623 --> 01:39:57,691
[Himekawa smirks]

1725
01:40:00,461 --> 01:40:01,729
[Tai] Look at all of you.

1726
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:04,498
It's great to see you again.

1727
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:14,174
Meiko...
