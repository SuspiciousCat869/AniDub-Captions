[Misato] Change helm systems.

312
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:48,646
Enabling time space control.
Switching over to tri-axial helm.

313
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:51,941
Deploy AT Field on ignition.

314
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,277
We're at 36,000 RPM!
All systems go!

315
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,571
We are go for contact!

316
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:59,073
Skip countdown.
Initiate contact.

317
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:00,783
Contact!

318
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:06,247
Ignition!
[yells]

319
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:22,889
Course clear.

320
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,433
Check systems.
Friendlies to evacuate!

321
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:28,019
Here we go...
And locked. Wunder!

322
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:34,651
[triumphant music]

323
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,320
[Tama] Main wings damaged!

324
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:20,446
Ignore it!

325
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,325
Ready enemy annihilation!
Pitch 90 degrees down. Go astern!

326
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:26,494
Go astern, aye, captain!

327
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:35,378
Drag the core block
out of its camouflage cocoon!

328
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,593
[Tama] Fissures forming
in main wing structure!

329
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:45,847
Helm, hold course.
Main engine, give me full power.

330
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,598
All back full!

331
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,600
[Nagara] Maximum battle speed!

332
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:58,276
[electric guitar rock music]

333
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:18,588
[Kitakami] I have visuals
of enemy core blocks!

334
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,631
Hard to port!
Swing them round!

335
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,467
Roger that!

336
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,229
[triumphal music]

337
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:50,036
Full thrusters! All stop!

338
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:02,548
- Targets inactive!
- Main guns, get ready.

339
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:08,012
Load AP rounds. Enable direct feed
from main engine. Engage reload circuits.

340
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:10,014
[Takao] Circuits engaged.

341
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:12,600
Maintaining range correction until fire!

342
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:17,897
[Hyuga] Turrets have direct visual
targeting and manual tracking enabled!

343
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,732
That's good enough. Fire!

344
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:45,716
[Aoba] Targets annihilated.

345
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,469
[Misato] All stations stand down
to alert condition 2.

346
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:51,973
Retrieval of Unit 02 Improved.
Expedite damage control on the wings.

347
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:56,227
- Oh, wow.
- We actually won.

348
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,896
Oh man, that was pushing it.

349
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:02,525
This Captain's even more interesting
than Kaji let on.

350
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,819
So this is the power to slay gods.

351
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,239
Wunder, a fitting name
for a ship that embodies hope.

352
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:51,240
[Sakura] Subject BM-03,
provisionally Mr. Shinji Ikari.

353
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:54,076
The XO would like to fill you in.

354
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,872
- [Shinji] This is Unit 01?
- [Ritsuko] Yes,

355
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:02,001
Unit 01 is currently being employed
as this ship's main engine power core.

356
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:04,128
Hence, no pilot is needed.

357
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:08,007
[Shinji] So I'm really
not needed for anything.

358
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,968
[Ritsuko] The results of your
deep synch tests are back.

359
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:14,222
Your synchronization rates
were 0.000 percent.

360
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:17,683
Even if you boarded an Eva,
it wouldn't activate.

361
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:22,021
[Sakura] Wow.
Isn't that wonderful, Mr. Ikari?

362
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:27,193
[Ritsuko] Nevertheless, we cannot ignore
that you recently had Unit 01 awakened.

363
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:31,697
For this reason, you have been fitted
with a DSS choker.

364
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:35,785
- [Shinji] What is that?
- [Ritsuko] An insurance policy.

365
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:39,288
A physical failsafe device meant
to prevent any further awakenings.

366
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:40,915
It symbolizes our distrust,

367
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:43,209
as well as your punishment.

368
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:44,669
[Shinji] What do you mean?

369
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:48,923
[Ritsuko] If you allow your emotions
to overwhelm you while piloting an Eva

370
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:51,592
and the risk of another awakening
becomes real,

371
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:54,637
we will shut it down
at the cost of your life.

372
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:58,557
[Shinji] Does that mean...

373
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,644
I would die?

374
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,604
[Ritsuko] I won't deny it.

375
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:06,148
What are you... What?

376
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:09,360
Ms Misato, what's going on here?

377
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:15,241
Why kill me? It doesn't make sense!
How am I supposed to understand?

378
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:17,618
Confusion is natural.
Lieutenant.

379
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:20,705
- Yes ma'am!
- Tell him your name and rank.

380
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:21,914
[Sakura] Yes ma'am.

381
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:26,585
I realize it's a little late now,
but I'm your supervising medical officer,

382
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:30,965
Second Lieutenant Sakura Suzuhara.
Nice to meet you, sir.

383
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:32,591
Oh, sure.

384
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:38,097
Wait, Suzuhara?
Are you related to Tohji?

385
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:43,853
Yes. Thanks for looking out
for my brother. I'm his younger sister.

386
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,105
[Shinji] Don't you mean his big sister?

387
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,316
No, sir, younger sister.

388
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:51,902
His younger sister? But how?

389
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:55,614
[Asuka] It’s because you were out cold
for 14 years.

390
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:57,575
Idiot Shinji.

391
00:26:58,326 --> 00:26:59,577
[Shinji] Asuka!

392
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:06,625
I'm so glad to see you!
I knew you were okay, Asuka!

393
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:07,710
What?

394
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:16,635
It's no use, I can't hold it in.
I've kept it pent up all these years.

395
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:18,637
[sighs]

396
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:23,768
What's gotten into you?

397
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:26,562
[Asuka] Pent-up rage and sorrow.

398
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:32,068
What are you talking about?
Asuka, what happened to your left eye?

399
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,778
None of your business.

400
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,782
Asuka, you said 14 years have passed.

401
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:40,743
But aside from the eye patch,
you look the same.

402
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,120
Yeah, the curse of the Eva.

403
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:44,872
The Eva's curse?

404
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,503
Wait a second!
Asuka, you would know, right?

405
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,671
Tell me! Where's Ayanami?

406
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:54,548
No idea.

407
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:58,260
What? But I saved her back then!

408
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:00,971
Big fuss over just one person.

409
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:04,850
The life of one single person
means absolutely jack in today's world.

410
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:07,728
Isn't that right, Colonel Katsuragi?

411
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:11,482
Asuka!

412
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:15,486
Ms Misato!
Where is Ayanami? Please tell me.

413
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:19,448
You need to understand,
Rei Ayanami doesn't exist anymore.

414
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:22,910
No, I know that I saved her!

415
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:27,456
I'm sure she's still inside Unit 01's
entry plug. Please, look inside carefully.

416
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,251
We've searched
every inch inside Unit 01.

417
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,212
All we found was you, and…

418
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,882
this, which had been
reconstructed somehow.

419
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:40,386
Screening results reveal
no abnormalities, you can have it back.

420
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:42,888
This is my father's.

421
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:47,685
Ayanami had this with her.
I did save her.

422
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:50,896
What was that?

423
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:53,983
Talk to me.

424
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,735
[Hyuga] Target has appeared
 on the afterdeck.

425
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:58,654
Must be the real deal.

426
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,990
All hands, battle stations. Position 1!

427
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,867
Prioritize safeguarding Unit 01.

428
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,869
Unit 08 is ready to go, right?

429
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,495
[Kitakami] Prepare Eva 08.

430
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:09,457
[Mari] I'm saddling up as we speak,
Your Highness.

431
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:13,002
So how is our little puppy?
Did he sit still like a good dog?

432
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:16,547
[Asuka] He hasn't changed a bit.
 His hair and face, goofy as ever.

433
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:20,926
Oh, but that was exactly
what you wanted to go and see.

434
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,553
[Asuka] No! I went there...

435
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:23,929
to belt him one.

436
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:29,268
Ms Misato! Ms Ritsuko!
What happened? Is it a new angel?

437
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,771
[Rei] Shinji. Where are you?

438
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:38,819
Ayanami? You heard her voice
just now, right? Ms Misato!

439
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,864
[straining]

440
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,908
Damn it, what the hell!

441
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:46,911
We're ready to go.
Mr. Ikari, come with me!

442
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:49,497
[Rei] Shinji... Where are you?

443
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,332
It is Ayanami.

444
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,168
It's Ayanami!

445
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,379
Mr. Ikari, we must hurry!

446
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:01,467
[Shinji] I've had enough.

447
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,427
Ayanami, I'm here!

448
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:05,513
[cries]

449
00:30:10,351 --> 00:30:15,481
[Tama] Depressurization in temporary
 quarantined interrogation room.

450
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,525
- Emergency bulkhead shutdown.
 - Eva?

451
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:18,984
Unit Zero?

452
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:22,071
[Rei] Shinji, come this way.

453
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:24,698
[Misato] No, Shinji.

454
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:26,659
You're staying put.

455
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:31,580
What the hell, Ms Misato!
You just said you didn't need me.

456
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:33,999
We'll keep you in protective custody.

457
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,710
You're not making any sense at all!

458
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:44,426
Stop this!
That's an Eva you're firing on!

459
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,846
We going to exterminate
all of NERV's Eva Units.

460
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:51,308
But you're a part of NERV!

461
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:55,604
No, we are WILLE, an organization
dedicated to the destruction of NERV.

462
00:30:56,313 --> 00:31:01,610
What?
But Ayanami's piloting that Eva!

463
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,779
Ayanami is gone!

464
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,323
You're lying! She's right here!

465
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:09,827
How can you be so blind?
I've had enough of this!

00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:53,496
[Shinji] Thank you.

625
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:57,875
You're amazing.
It seems like you can do anything.

626
00:47:57,959 --> 00:48:00,587
[Kaworu] It's only a matter
of technical knowledge.

627
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:03,089
I've just been here
a little longer than you.

628
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:06,342
Still... You're amazing.

629
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:11,180
You seem rather deflated.
What's the matter?

630
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:17,854
I'm worried about my friends.

631
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:19,564
Your friends?

632
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:21,190
[sighs]

633
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:26,154
There used to be a city
on top of NERV HQ. They all lived there.

634
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:29,991
Tohji, Kensuke,
the class rep and everyone else.

635
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:34,537
I guess I really was asleep
inside Unit 01 for 14 years…

636
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:38,791
and everything changed during that time.

637
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:42,920
It must be hard
for you to cope with all that change.

638
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:45,423
[Shinji] I'm afraid...

639
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:51,471
because I don't know what happened
to the city, to everyone.

640
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,891
I'm so afraid, its driving me crazy.

641
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:56,059
I'm terrified!

642
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:05,777
Do you want to know?

643
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:20,667
[gasps]

644
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,349
Nagisa? Nagisa!

645
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:53,950
[Kaworu]
Come on, we're almost there.

646
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,840
[panting]

647
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:13,553
[Kaworu] The clouds will break soon.

648
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:16,472
You'll be able to see the truth.

649
00:50:24,564 --> 00:50:25,857
What is this?

650
00:50:32,113 --> 00:50:37,034
[Kaworu] The result of the Third Impact
while you were fused with Unit 01.

651
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:44,125
[Shinji]
 Then everyone in the city must have...

652
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:48,087
Mass extinctions
are not rare on this planet.

653
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:51,299
They actually spur on evolution.

654
00:50:52,425 --> 00:50:56,179
After all, life-forms transform themselves
to adapt to the world.

655
00:50:57,889 --> 00:51:02,935
But the Lilin transform the world
instead of themselves.

656
00:51:04,312 --> 00:51:08,608
And so, they created a rite
in order to artificially evolve.

657
00:51:10,443 --> 00:51:13,070
Sacrificing the life-forms of the past

658
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:16,908
in order to create new life-forms
imbued with the fruit of life.

659
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:21,996
This extinction is all part of a program
hard-coded in antiquity.

660
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:26,709
NERV called it
the Human Instrumentality Project.

661
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:30,630
NERV did this? What was...

662
00:51:32,799 --> 00:51:35,009
What was my father trying to do?

663
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:38,971
Shinji Ikari...

664
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:43,976
Once awakened,
Eva Unit 01 opened the Doors of Guf

665
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:47,146
and acted as the trigger
to bring about the Third Impact.

666
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:50,608
The Lilin call it
the "Near Third Impact".

667
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,570
You were the key to all of this.

668
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:00,076
No...

669
00:52:00,493 --> 00:52:03,955
I just wanted to save Ayanami.

670
00:52:06,082 --> 00:52:09,377
[Kaworu]
Perhaps. But that caused this.

671
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:16,425
[Shinji] [crying] No…
 How was I supposed to know!

672
00:52:17,093 --> 00:52:20,304
It's all too much.
 I can't do anything about this!

673
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:24,225
[Kaworu] True. It's a horrific past
you can't do anything about.

674
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:27,478
This is the truth you wanted to know.

675
00:52:28,604 --> 00:52:32,441
As a consequence, the Lilin
made you bear the wages of that sin.

676
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:36,612
Isn't that what that thing
on your neck represents?

677
00:52:37,864 --> 00:52:43,494
[Shinji] [crying] Sin? I didn't sin!
 I have nothing to do with this!

678
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:46,539
[Kaworu] That's not how others see it.

679
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:51,210
However there are no sins
you can't atone for.

680
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:55,590
There is hope. There is always hope.

681
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:56,883
Ah!

682
00:53:13,024 --> 00:53:15,985
[Fuyutsuki] SEELE's boy
has made contact with the Third Boy.

683
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:18,696
It appears the Third Boy
was shown the outside world.

684
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:24,535
I wonder how he will take it.
Aren't you worried, Ikari?

685
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:27,830
[Gendoh]
We will rewrite SEELE's scenario.

686
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:31,959
Any and all beings
are tools to that end.

687
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:35,087
Do you feel
that opening up to your son…

688
00:53:35,171 --> 00:53:36,839
would not be in his interests?

689
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:40,343
I feel differently.

690
00:53:43,346 --> 00:53:47,808
What the hell?
How did this happen?

691
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:56,192
Wait. I was able to save Ayanami.

692
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:58,694
That's what matters.

693
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:26,389
She's out again.
 And she hasn't touched these.

694
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:32,812
What's going on?
 What happened to Ayanami?

695
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:45,366
Third Boy, can you play Shogi?

696
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:48,953
[Shinji] Well, I know the rules.

697
00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:51,038
That'll do.

698
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:54,375
Come with me. I'll play
at a handicap to even the odds.

699
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:04,969
Calm yourself to achieve inner serenity.

700
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,097
It's a necessity in order to win battles.

701
00:55:09,724 --> 00:55:12,351
You will lose in 31 moves.

702
00:55:12,435 --> 00:55:13,436
Hmmm.

703
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:16,647
Hmmm.

704
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,945
[Fuyutsuki] This should make
for a more enjoyable game.

705
00:55:25,406 --> 00:55:28,826
Thank you for humoring this old man.

706
00:55:33,164 --> 00:55:34,707
I am a coward, you see.

707
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:39,086
I needed an excuse
to be able to converse with you.

708
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:42,965
Do you remember your mother?

709
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:48,888
No, I was very young
when she died.

710
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,725
And my father threw away
everything related to her.

711
00:55:57,313 --> 00:55:58,314
This woman...

712
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:01,358
is it Ayanami?

713
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:06,113
That's your mother.
Her maiden name was Yui Ayanami.

714
00:56:06,489 --> 00:56:08,741
She was a student of mine in college.

715
00:56:10,326 --> 00:56:13,913
She's now part
of Eva Unit 01's pilot interface.

716
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:20,336
Good, the power
has finally been restored.

717
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,671
[Shinji] Oh...

718
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:26,926
[Fuyutsuki] That is the very
early version of the Eva control system.

719
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:31,347
Yui envisioned a direct core entry system,
and she tested it herself.

720
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:34,183
You saw it,
although your memory has been wiped.

721
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:38,521
It ended with Yui disappearing in there.

722
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:48,197
Leaving behind only her information,

723
00:56:49,198 --> 00:56:52,243
which would become the Ayanami series.

724
00:56:52,952 --> 00:56:56,705
The Rei Ayanami you know
is one of the replicas of Yui.

725
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:03,045
Along with your mother,
she too is now trapped inside Unit 01.

726
00:57:03,712 --> 00:57:05,589
It's all part of your father's plans.

727
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:08,259
No...

728
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:13,139
[Fuyutsuki] Breaking apart the world
is a trivial matter.

729
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,682
However...

730
00:57:14,974 --> 00:57:17,393
rebuilding it is not so easy.

731
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:21,522
As with time itself, the course
of the world cannot be reversed.

732
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:23,983
Nor can people's hearts.

733
00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:30,447
That is why your father is sacrificing
everything to make his wish come true.

734
00:57:30,823 --> 00:57:32,658
Including his very soul.

735
00:57:34,326 --> 00:57:36,996
I wanted to share some truths with you.

736
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:38,956
To tell you about your father.

737
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:53,470
What a wretched role to play.

738
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:57,892
Is this what you wanted, Yui?

739
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:07,401
[Gendoh] The time for the final pact
draws near.

740
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:12,656
We'll be together again soon, Yui.

741
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:23,667
[Shinji] Why don't you read the books?

742
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:27,296
[Rei] I wasn't ordered to.

743
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:32,426
[Shinji] Orders, huh?
Fine! Forget it, then!

744
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:38,432
[grunts] You're Ayanami, right?

745
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:41,101
[Rei] Yes, I'm Rei Ayanami.

746
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:44,230
You're the one I saved, right?

747
00:58:44,772 --> 00:58:45,773
I don't know.

748
00:58:46,357 --> 00:58:49,568
[grunts]

749
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:55,699
Shinji?

750
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:03,332
I didn't save her...

751
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,336
I lost Ayanami.

752
00:59:08,629 --> 00:59:11,507
[Misato] [repeating]
 Don't do anything.

753
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:12,758
Mother...

754
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:17,221
[Gendoh] [repeating] Pilot the Eva.

755
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:21,475
[Sakura] Just don't pilot an Eva, ever.

756
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,644
[Misato] [repeating] Don't do anything.

757
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:26,313
[Gendoh] Pilot the EVA.

758
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:31,068
[Shinji] Ms Misako.

759
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:34,029
[Gendoh] Pilot the Eva.

760
00:59:34,113 --> 00:59:36,031
[Sakura] Just don't pilot an Eva, ever.

761
00:59:36,115 --> 00:59:37,950
[Gendoh] Pilot the Eva.

762
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:42,454
Pilot the Eva.

763
00:59:42,538 --> 00:59:44,123
[Sakura] Just don't pilot an Eva.

764
00:59:44,206 --> 00:59:46,583
[Misato] Don't do anything.

765
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:48,877
[Sakura] Don't pilot an Eva.

766
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:51,130
[Rei] I don't know.

767
00:59:58,262 --> 01:00:00,180
What have I been doing?

768
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:07,646
[yells] Ah!

769
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:39,470
[Fuyutsuki] So, the final
executor is at last complete.

770
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:43,474
[Gendoh] Yes. We now possess
all the tools we need.

771
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:50,147
The time has come.
This is our moment,

772
01:00:50,689 --> 01:00:51,899
Shinji Ikari.

773
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:57,112
No! I don't want
to pilot an Eva anymore!

774
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:59,823
I didn't save Ayanami!

775
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:02,951
Nothing good ever comes
from piloting an Eva.

776
01:01:03,035 --> 01:01:05,204
I'm sick of it.
I don't want to do anything!

777
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:10,459
[Kaworu] But nothing good would come
from replaying

778
01:01:10,918 --> 01:01:12,669
a traumatic refrain in your head.

779
01:01:13,212 --> 01:01:15,923
[crying]
Nothing good ever happens!

780
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:18,384
You showed it to me!

781
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:21,720
That red desolate world…

782
01:01:22,638 --> 01:01:26,809
[Kaworu] Change brought about by an Eva
can be changed again with an Eva.

783
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:31,772
[Shinji] It doesn't matter! Evas, Father,
Ms Misato... I can't trust anyone anymore!

784
01:01:33,232 --> 01:01:35,609
But at least you can trust me.

785
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:36,985
I can't!

786
01:01:39,405 --> 01:01:42,658
Ms Misato and the others
put this thing on me.

787
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:48,080
They said never to pilot an Eva again.
Threatened to kill me if I did.

788
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:54,711
I don't care about Evas anymore.

789
01:01:59,508 --> 01:02:05,472
I'll take the Lilin curse and
the risk of the Eva awakening on myself.

790
01:02:11,687 --> 01:02:13,105
Nagisa... no...

791
01:02:14,148 --> 01:02:15,816
Don't worry about it.

792
01:02:16,275 --> 01:02:19,570
They originally made this out of fear
for what I might do.

793
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,448
I planned to do this sooner or later.

794
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,201
Shinji Ikari,

795
01:02:26,285 --> 01:02:31,331
your hope rests with the two spears left
at ground zero inside the Central Dogma.

796
01:02:31,874 --> 01:02:34,626
They are the key to the initiating
the Project.

797
01:02:35,127 --> 01:02:37,337
All we have to do is take those spears.

798
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:41,884
That way, NERV won't be able
to bring about a Fourth Impact.

799
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:47,222
And when used with Unit 13, the spears
will allow us to repair the world.

800
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:54,980
You're right.
Yes, you could do it.

801
01:02:55,606 --> 01:02:57,441
No, it's us together.

802
01:02:58,484 --> 01:03:01,445
Unit 13 uses a double entry plug system.

803
01:03:02,488 --> 01:03:04,781
Together, we'll give hope to the Lilins.

804
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:08,869
What you need
most of all right now is hope.

805
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:12,581
As well as redemption and peace of mind.

806
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:19,713
You're amazing.
You know everything.

807
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:22,883
That's because all I think about is you.

808
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,055
Thank you, Nagisa.

809
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:30,265
Just call me Kaworu.

810
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,604
Call me just Shinji as well.

811
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:42,945
It's like playing the piano.
Good things come when we play together,

812
01:03:43,612 --> 01:03:44,821
Shinji.

813
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:49,326
[Shinji] Right. Let's do this, Kaworu.

814
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:57,626
[hydraulic doors opening]

815
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,410
[Kaworu & Shinji]
Evangelion Unit 13, activate!

816
01:04:33,537 --> 01:04:36,707
[Aoba] Signal detected!
An Eva has been activated.

817
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:58,645
[Shinji] We're not doing this
by ourselves?

818
01:04:59,146 --> 01:05:02,190
[Kaworu] You mean the Mark nine?
It's here for backup.

819
01:05:02,733 --> 01:05:04,693
NERV is worried about WILLE.

820
01:05:05,527 --> 01:05:07,654
[Shinji] We can handle this by ourselves.

821
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:10,616
She's not Ayanami, anyway.

822
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:12,868
I am not Ayanami?

823
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,416
[Shinji] The wall, they're...

824
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:23,295
[Kaworu] Yes, they're the ones
that failed to become Infinities.

825
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,135
You don't have to worry about it.

826
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:34,681
We're almost at Lilith's seal.

827
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:37,726
It's completely blocking the main shaft,

828
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:41,480
preventing anyone from entering
for the past 14 years.

829
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:48,862
[Shinji] It's like a huge lid.

830
01:05:49,696 --> 01:05:53,450
[Kaworu] Don't worry.
Unit 13's purpose is to breach it.

831
01:05:54,076 --> 01:05:55,452
Together, we can do it.

832
01:05:55,827 --> 01:05:56,828
Hmmm.

833
01:06:05,921 --> 01:06:09,800
Synchronize our tempos,
just like when playing the piano.

834
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,305
Here we go, Shinji.

835
01:06:15,389 --> 01:06:16,348
[grunts]

836
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:21,144
[ping / smashing]

837
01:06:21,228 --> 01:06:24,189
[dramatic choral music]

838
01:06:37,828 --> 01:06:38,829
We did it.

839
01:06:56,555 --> 01:06:58,056
[Kaworu] Here we are.

840
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:00,434
The bottom most level
of the Central Dogma.

841
01:07:04,563 --> 01:07:06,690
Ground zero of the Third Impact.

842
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:13,613
[Shinji] Is that Lilith?

843
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:15,365
[Kaworu] What used to be.

844
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:17,534
Now, it's only a carcass.

845
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:21,872
Ms Misato was willing
to sacrifice her life to protect it.

846
01:07:23,999 --> 01:07:25,584
Is that an Eva?

847
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:28,545
Yes, Eva Mark 6.

848
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:33,884
The sad remains of the unit altered
by the Lilin to function autonomously.

849
01:07:39,181 --> 01:07:42,392
[Shinji] The things sticking
through Lilith, that's our target?

850
01:07:42,726 --> 01:07:45,562
Yes, Longinus and Cassius.

851
01:07:46,021 --> 01:07:50,275
Two souls are required
to retrieve the two spears.

852
01:07:50,901 --> 01:07:53,278
Hence the double entry plug system.

853
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:57,491
If they needed two souls,
why didn't they just use her?

854
01:07:58,492 --> 01:08:01,286
A facsimile
made by the Lilin wouldn't work.

855
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:03,789
The seat of the soul
is in a different place.

856
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:06,291
Alright, let's get started.

857
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:14,883
Wait.

858
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:17,385
Something's not right...

859
01:08:17,469 --> 01:08:18,929
[Shinji] What is it, Kaworu?

860
01:08:21,723 --> 01:08:26,186
[Kaworu] This is strange. The two spears
have changed shape to look alike.

861
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:28,021
Let's pull them out.

862
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:30,565
That's why we've come here, right?

863
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:35,862
What the hell was that?

864
01:08:45,664 --> 01:08:46,748
Unit 02!

865
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:48,333
Asuka?

866
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:52,754
What are you doing, Asuka!

867
01:08:55,257 --> 01:08:56,383
Idiot Shinji!

868
01:08:56,967 --> 01:08:59,302
Don't tell me you're piloting that Eva!

869
01:08:59,386 --> 01:09:00,387
[Shinji] Yes I am.

870
01:09:00,762 --> 01:09:03,014
And with this Eva I will change the world.

871
01:09:04,266 --> 01:09:07,644
Damn brat.
You can help by not piloting an Eva!

872
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:17,404
You're always late with your cover fire!

873
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:18,613
[Mari] Sorry, my bad.

874
01:09:19,406 --> 01:09:21,032
Well dear Vessel of the Adams.

875
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:25,245
At the very least, I'm going
to slow you down a bit, kiddo.

876
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:32,544
Ya!

877
01:09:44,723 --> 01:09:46,725
Why are you trying to stop me?

878
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,811
Those spears are our only hope!

879
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:54,816
[Asuka] Stop trying to help!
 You'll only make things worse!

880
01:09:55,150 --> 01:09:57,861
Do you want to start
another Third Impact?

881
01:09:57,944 --> 01:09:59,029
No!

882
01:09:59,613 --> 01:10:02,365
If we had those spears,
 we could start everything over!

883
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:04,826
We could save the world!

884
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:08,622
You're such a naïve child.

885
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:11,541
You never listen!

886
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:22,969
I could use your help, Kaworu.

887
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:29,059
We need a matched set of spears.
We need Cassius and Longinus.

888
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:33,563
Instead, all we have here
are two identical spears.

889
01:10:33,647 --> 01:10:34,689
Kaworu!

890
01:10:35,023 --> 01:10:38,443
So that's it...
That's your plan.

891
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:40,320
Lilin!

892
01:10:45,492 --> 01:10:47,869
[Mari] Hello,
 dearest SEELE stand-in pilot.

893
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,829
I know you can hear me.

894
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:54,918
I suggest you clear out of there
before you become part of Adams' Vessel.

895
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:56,962
[Rei] I can't. I wasn't ordered to.

896
01:10:57,837 --> 01:10:59,631
Uptight, ain't ya?

897
01:11:00,048 --> 01:11:03,009
You know, your original
was a lot easier to get along with.

898
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:06,471
Original? A different me?

899
01:11:06,805 --> 01:11:09,766
Ah!

900
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:23,738
[grunts]
Kaworu, what's gotten into you?

901
01:11:26,074 --> 01:11:28,201
[Asuka] [yells]

902
01:11:34,666 --> 01:11:39,045
[yelling] Asuka,
please stop getting in my way!

903
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:42,590
Just give up
and drop dead, Brat Shinji!

904
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:50,974
Damn it, not now!
Four-Eyed Crony, throw me a spare!

905
01:11:58,273 --> 01:11:59,858
Now get the spears.

906
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:05,363
[Asuka] How dare you hit a woman.
You bastard.

907
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:07,365
[Mari] Here's your spare, Highness.

908
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:20,170
We should stop, Shinji.

909
01:12:20,962 --> 01:12:22,505
I have a bad feeling.

910
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:27,427
We can't stop now, Kaworu.
What did we come all this way for?

911
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:30,722
We need to let it go.
Those are not the spears we need.

912
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:34,559
[Shinji] What do you mean,
not the spears we need?

913
01:12:38,188 --> 01:12:40,565
You said we needed these spears!

914
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:44,319
That's why I got into this Eva!

915
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:47,697

My control systems!

917
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:57,582
[Shinji] I'll grab those spears for you.
For everyone...

918
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:00,126
The world will be normal again.

919
01:13:02,337 --> 01:13:04,047
And then even Ms Misato...

920
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:05,340
will have to...

921
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:11,012
[Asuka] Crap! Four-Eyed Crony, you've
 got a shot! Permission to use AA rounds!

01:13:11,096 --> 01:13:12,138
[Mari] Goody!

923
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:14,474
My ace in the hole.

924
01:13:20,188 --> 01:13:21,689
It doesn't have an AT Field?

925
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:25,401
Wait a second, don't tell me...

926
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:39,124
Don't do this, Shinji.

927
01:13:39,207 --> 01:13:40,583
Stop it, you brat!

What's going on?

934

Crap!
The 12th Angel isn't dead yet!

935

936
01:14:28,298 --> 01:14:29,340
[Mari] Alrighty!

937
01:14:30,884 --> 01:14:35,013
[Asuka] I'll finish this thing off
before the Third Impact restarts!

01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:40,894
These were my orders.

939
01:14:50,028 --> 01:14:51,529
An Angel!

940
01:14:59,621 --> 01:15:01,247
[screams]

941
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:02,332
[Mari] Your Highness!

942
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:06,794
Don't waste your ammo!
 That whole thing is a core.

943
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:10,256
Forget it.
We don't have a chance in the world.

944
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:18,556
Besides, I'm curious to see what'll
happen after the final Angel is beaten.

945
01:15:18,973 --> 01:15:21,517
[chuckling]

946
01:15:22,268 --> 01:15:23,394
What is this?

947
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:30,360
Is this me?

948
01:15:32,487 --> 01:15:34,322
Then who am I?

949
01:15:34,405 --> 01:15:36,282
[Shinji] [straining]

950
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:40,203
The controls aren't responding!
What's going on, Kaworu?

951
01:15:42,664 --> 01:15:43,665
Kaworu!

952
01:15:44,832 --> 01:15:47,293
To think that I, the 1st Angel,

953
01:15:47,669 --> 01:15:50,129
would fall and become
the 13th Angel like this...

954
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:52,340
What are you saying?
Kaworu!

955
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:58,680
So the beginning and the end
are one and the same.

956
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:03,059
Well played, King of the Lilin,
Father of Shinji Ikari.

957
01:16:03,977 --> 01:16:06,604
[Mari] Pattern Blue detected
in the DSS choker!

958
01:16:06,688 --> 01:16:08,523
There shouldn't be a 13th Angel.

959
01:16:09,399 --> 01:16:11,484
So this is what Gendoh was after.

960
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:18,908
[Gendoh] It is time to revise the pact
laid down in the Dead Sea Scrolls.

961
01:16:19,409 --> 01:16:20,493
This is farewell.

962
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:25,581
Though your souls may have
taken on a different form,

963
01:16:25,665 --> 01:16:28,167
you are still products
of the forbidden fruit.

964
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:31,921
While it may be possible to live
eternally, death must come to you

965
01:16:32,005 --> 01:16:33,881
as it does to us.

966
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:39,637
In your quest to assist the evolution of
our ilk and kin burdened with mortality.

967
01:16:41,431 --> 01:16:48,396
You gave us the gift of civilization.
So today on behalf of all of humanity...

968
01:16:50,857 --> 01:16:53,192
I express our gratitude.

969
01:16:55,820 --> 01:17:00,199
With your death, I will return
your souls to where they belong.

970
01:17:02,493 --> 01:17:05,538
I shall carry out
your Human Instrumentality Project

971
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:09,667
as well as the deicide
that you long sought after.

972
01:17:11,002 --> 01:17:12,503
You can rest in peace.

973
01:17:12,754 --> 01:17:19,218
[SEELE] Our goals have already been met.
 It is good. All is very good.

974
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:23,181
We hope for humanity's instrumentality
 to be realized.

975
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:25,808
Let their souls be peacefully cleansed.

976
01:17:27,852 --> 01:17:30,355
[Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" playing]

977
01:17:57,715 --> 01:18:00,134
It's going beyond
the Pseudo DMS Phase!

978
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:02,178
It has awakened alright.

979
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:05,098
Must be a straggler Adam!

980
01:18:13,648 --> 01:18:15,358
[straining]

981
01:18:40,758 --> 01:18:42,385
What is going on?

982
01:18:42,844 --> 01:18:45,138
[screeching]

983
01:18:55,982 --> 01:18:57,191
What is this?

984
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:07,034
Is this my fault?
Because I pulled out the spears?

985
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:14,959
Is this...

986
01:19:16,002 --> 01:19:17,670
[Kaworu] The Fourth Impact.

987
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:18,754
[gasps]

988
01:19:19,881 --> 01:19:22,467
This is its opening rites.

989
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:38,232
Kaworu... your choker!

990
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,117
Ms Misato!

991
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:53,539
[Misato] A.T. Field at max strength!
Seal the Eva inside it!

992
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:56,542
All main guns, ready salvo.
Load high-arcing rounds.

993
01:19:57,043 --> 01:19:59,128
We'll prevent a Fourth Impact!

994
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:00,546
Fire!

995
01:20:08,012 --> 01:20:10,640
We're hit!
Direct hits to our main guns!

996
01:20:10,723 --> 01:20:12,308
Vessel of the Adams!

997
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:18,814
[Tama] Central block hit!

998
01:20:18,898 --> 01:20:20,691
[Takao] We're losing power.

999
01:20:20,775 --> 01:20:22,652
[Nagara] Helm not responding.

1000
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:24,195
We are going down!

1001
01:20:32,912 --> 01:20:34,705
[Tama] Central block hit!

1002
01:20:34,789 --> 01:20:37,250
Start emergency measures
to bypass damaged areas!

1003
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:39,710
The Adams
was Wunder's original owner.

1004
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:43,172
It's trying to take back control
of this ship from Unit 01.

1005
01:20:48,803 --> 01:20:51,264
The controls,
why aren't they coming back?

1006
01:20:55,226 --> 01:20:56,686
[Mari] [straining]

1007
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:01,190
Oh, that's one fine mess
we got going on here.

1008
01:21:01,274 --> 01:21:04,652
Four-Eyed Crony,
handle the Eva! I'll rescue the Wunder!

1009
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:05,736
[Mari] Roger!

1010
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:08,239
[Kitakami]
We can't dislodge the Adams Vessel!

1011
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:11,200
[Tama] Unidentified data
infiltrating central control.

1012
01:21:11,284 --> 01:21:13,244
[Aoba] I'm losing control of the ship.

1013
01:21:35,016 --> 01:21:37,518
Not fair!
SEELE's playing dirty again!

1014
01:21:44,775 --> 01:21:46,110
Change modes!

1015
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:47,612
Code Triple Seven.

1016
01:21:49,155 --> 01:21:50,197
[gasps]

1017
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:58,956
Who the hell are you?

1018
01:22:15,348 --> 01:22:18,601
Engaging the Vessel of the Adams!

1019
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:20,227
I'm counting on you, Asuka.

1020
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:42,166
What would Rei Ayanami do
at a time like this?

1021
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:43,834
Hell if I know!

1022
01:22:43,918 --> 01:22:45,670
Question is what do you want to do?

1023
01:22:49,507 --> 01:22:51,175
Now I can hit the core!

1024
01:23:00,267 --> 01:23:02,353
What? This entire thing is a core!

1025
01:23:03,104 --> 01:23:04,563
I'm out of time.

1026
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:06,899
I'm sorry, Unit 02!

1027
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:24,875
[Kitakami] Control systems back online!

1028
01:23:24,959 --> 01:23:28,129
[Misato] Emergency full power!
Pursue target Eva immediately.

1029
01:23:28,212 --> 01:23:30,214
We need the main engine first!

1030
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:32,174
[grunts] Shinji!

1031
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:55,156
Is it my fault?

1032
01:23:57,992 --> 01:23:59,285
Did I…

1033
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:01,829
do this?

1034
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:04,874
[Kaworu] It's not your fault.

1035
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:12,006
It happened because I turned
into the 13th Angel. I am the trigger.

1036
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:14,508
What should I do?

1037
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:18,012
Please, tell me.

1038
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:26,145
Kaworu... Tell me.

1039
01:24:26,896 --> 01:24:29,064
What am I supposed to do now?

1040
01:24:29,148 --> 01:24:31,275
Even when a soul is lost,

1041
01:24:31,358 --> 01:24:34,320
its aspirations and curses
remain in this world.

1042
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:38,824
Human will is conveyed as information
throughout the world, and it changes it.

1043
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:42,119
In time, we rewrite who we are.

1044
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:49,293
I'm sorry. This isn't the happiness
that you were hoping to find.

1045
01:24:51,128 --> 01:24:55,424
I'll close the Doors of Guf.
You don't have to worry, Shinji.

1046
01:24:57,051 --> 01:24:58,344
Kaworu.

1047
01:25:00,054 --> 01:25:03,182
I don't understand
anything you're saying. Kaworu...

1048
01:25:09,688 --> 01:25:13,943
Shinji, you need to find a place
to rest that you can call your own.

1049
01:25:21,909 --> 01:25:24,370
The ties that bind you
will show you the way.

1050
01:25:29,083 --> 01:25:34,338
Please, don't look so sad.
We'll meet again, Shinji.

1051
01:25:35,506 --> 01:25:36,757
[yells] Kaworu!

1052
01:25:55,359 --> 01:25:57,194
[Mari] The doors aren't closing!

1053
01:25:57,695 --> 01:25:59,905
Our puppy must be SEELE's insurance.

1054
01:26:16,463 --> 01:26:19,675
Everything's wrapped up!
Snap out of it, doggy!

1055
01:26:21,886 --> 01:26:22,887
Stop being a baby!

1056
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:24,555
At least save the Princess!

1057
01:26:24,889 --> 01:26:25,806
Man up, kid!

1058
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,769
And learn a thing or two
about life while you're at it.

1059
01:27:24,823 --> 01:27:29,286
What an absolute mess.
This is almost what SEELE wanted.

1060
01:27:30,204 --> 01:27:36,210
[Gendoh] Perhaps, but we've neutralized
SEELE's Boy and awakened Unit 13.

1061
01:27:37,711 --> 01:27:40,089
Colonel Katsuragi's actions
were expected.

1062
01:27:40,923 --> 01:27:42,508
For now, this is fine.

1063
01:27:43,801 --> 01:27:46,595
[Hyuga] All stations,
 remain in alert condition 2.

1064
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:50,349
[Kitakami] Pattern Blue can't be detected.
 No contact in alert airspace.

1065
01:27:50,432 --> 01:27:52,977
[Tama] Temporary repairs on
 damaged areas complete.

1066
01:27:53,435 --> 01:27:57,564
I don't know how or why,
but a Fourth Impact was averted.

1067
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:01,402
That's something to be thankful for.

Hey, Shinji.

1071
01:28:55,748 --> 01:28:58,125
You didn't come to help me, stupid brat.

1072
01:29:02,129 --> 01:29:06,050
All you do is think about yourself.
You think shutting up is the answer?

1073
01:29:20,147 --> 01:29:21,190

[Asuka] You act like a baby.

1076
01:29:35,287 --> 01:29:36,830
After all these years,

1077
01:29:36,914 --> 01:29:38,791
you're still the same annoying brat!

1078
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:41,335
Here, you'll carry the bag.

1079
01:29:41,835 --> 01:29:43,003
Come on!

1080
01:29:43,087 --> 01:29:45,881
You can at least stand up, can't you?

1081
01:29:50,636 --> 01:29:52,012
Hey, you're that pilot.

1082
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:55,224
One of the original Ayanami batch.

1083
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:06,819
The L containment field density here
is too strong for them to rescue us

1084
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:12,032
so let's move to a spot
where the Lilin can come for us.

1085
01:30:14,076 --> 01:30:15,077
Come on!

1086
01:30:43,856 --> 01:30:46,275
[soft music]

1087
01:35:03,907 --> 01:35:07,911
[Misato] Having lost his will to live,
 Shinji Ikari wanders aimlessly.

1088
01:35:07,994 --> 01:35:11,039
The place he ends up
 helps him regain hope.

1089
01:35:11,289 --> 01:35:15,043
The Human Instrumentality Project
 is finally initiated.

1090
01:35:15,544 --> 01:35:19,131
WILLE begins the final showdown
 to stop the Final Impact.

1091
01:35:19,506 --> 01:35:21,591
The Wunder streaks through the sky.

1092
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:25,679
Eva Unit 08 plus 02
 runs across the red Earth.
