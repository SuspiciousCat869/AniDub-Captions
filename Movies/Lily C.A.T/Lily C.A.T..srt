1
00:00:10,049 --> 00:00:12,716
(light banging)

2
00:00:29,217 --> 00:00:31,884
(cat shrieking)

3
00:00:35,588 --> 00:00:38,671
(deep, solemn music)

4
00:00:53,948 --> 00:00:54,781
- [Man] It's gonna be awhile before

5
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:56,794
we encounter real food again.

6
00:00:56,794 --> 00:00:57,627
- [Man] Yeah, they told me I shouldn't

7
00:00:57,627 --> 00:01:00,190
eat a big meal before this case.

8
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,630
- What scares me the most I
guess is what it'll feel like.

9
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,560
- There's really not a
thing to be worried about,

10
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,430
it's exactly like going to sleep at night,

11
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,850
only it lasts a lot longer
and it's much less stressful.

12
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,420
The computer'll show an
elapsed time of 20 years

13
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,410
when we wake up, but we'll have
aged only a year physically.

14
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,070
And you won't have felt a thing.

15
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,390
- I'm sure you're right, but
are you absolutely positive?

16
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,070
I mean at the space lab
they kept telling us

17
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,030
about all that stuff
but I would not be happy

18
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,843
if I woke up a wrinkled old bag.

19
00:01:26,227 --> 00:01:27,060
- Hm.
- Oh yes,

20
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,253
last night was a meal to remember.

21
00:01:28,253 --> 00:01:29,392
- [Man] She'll be right back.

22
00:01:29,392 --> 00:01:30,225
- [Man] Gonna have to
remember that for a long time.

23
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:32,174
- [Nancy] It's okay, Lily.

24
00:01:32,174 --> 00:01:34,230
(Lily meowing)

25
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,420
- Ah, don't tell me you're bringing it

26
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,630
into deep sleep with you.

27
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,520
- Oh course, like I'm gonna
leave her at home for 20 years.

28
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,260
If I don't bring her with
me, I'll never see her again.

29
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,570
- Oh yeah, and she'll be
real practical to have around

30
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,150
for all those space mice.

31
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,960
- A lot more practical than
your little pea shooter.

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,820
- Hm, aw, this little baby?

33
00:01:52,423 --> 00:01:53,747
(gun cocking)

34
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:56,730
I'm the careful type,
there might be aliens, kid.

35
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,970
- There might be, mate, but
since our number crunchers

36
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,840
indicate planet LA003 was
created about 4 1/2 billion

37
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,880
years back and is currently
going through a sort of

38
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,550
Cambrian Era geological
state, I somewhat doubt

39
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,250
you'll find anything bigger than a flee.

40
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,026
- Guess I'll have to shoot low.

41
00:02:11,026 --> 00:02:12,204
- [Man] Can record you know, right?

42
00:02:12,204 --> 00:02:13,910
- What the heck is that for?
- Nice guy.

43
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,700
- Our Mr. Headquarters doesn't
know the corporation flag?

44
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,760
- Listen, funny boy, I'm perfectly aware

45
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,410
it's the corporate flag, I'm asking you

46
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,870
what you brought it on board for.

47
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,610
- [Dick] Leave the kid alone
Morgan, what do you care?

48
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,080
- We gotta have a flag
to raise on our property.

49
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,460
- Ha, look bud.

50
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,293
- Jimmy.

51
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:31,160
- Right, hey, go for the promotion,

52
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,403
whatever twists your tits.

53
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:33,306
- [Jimmy] Huh?

54
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:35,470
- What I'm interested in is
the money, special mission pay.

55
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,550
- [Jimmy] Risk bonuses?

56
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,892
- Now you're singin' my song.

57
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,890
Can't beat that with
a stick, right Harris?

58
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,683
When we come back home after 40 years

59
00:02:42,683 --> 00:02:44,760
we'll be able to retire and still be

60
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,371
young enough to do some damage.

61
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:49,230
- Don't worry, I'll make
sure the contract's honored.

62
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,840
Just don't forget who's keeping an eye on

63
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,676
your efficiency reports for
the board of directors, guys.

64
00:02:53,676 --> 00:02:55,720
- Well, I was wondering what
the president's daughter

65
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,460
was doing on this bucket of bolts.

66
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,260
Don't despise her, she's
very sweet for a barracuda,

67
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,473
but don't touch her pussy cat.

68
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,910
- [Man] They've never lost one yet.

69
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,820
- I haven't had the pleasure
of welcoming the gents

70
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,637
from the Japanese sector, see
I'm from the Australian office

71
00:03:09,637 --> 00:03:11,100
the name's Berry, Dick Berry,

72
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,750
this your first interstellar run?

73
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:17,037
(laughing) Boy, the company
sure knows how to pick 'em.

74
00:03:17,037 --> 00:03:20,160
- Sometimes I wish we could
just take off without them.

75
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,680
The noise they're making,
you'd think this was a picnic.

76
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,810
Can you believe the stuff
they brought aboard?

77
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,340
Weapons, animals.

78
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,150
- Hey, lighten up a little,
we all like to bring something

79
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,250
on board, a keepsake, a good luck piece,

80
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,810
I've got a lucky charm I've brought on

81
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,498
every voyage I've made.

82
00:03:34,498 --> 00:03:35,331
- [Man] I would never have
thought of it that way.

83
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:37,280
- Come on, that's hogwash, captain.

84
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,040
- Yeah, well, I can't
exactly make too much fuss

85
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,590
about anybody else now, right?

86
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,810
- It's too bad they never
taught us at the space training

87
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,870
camp some way of not putting
our foot in our mouth.

88
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,540
I just put mine in up to the hip.

89
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,280
- Forget it, but now that you mention it,

90
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,160
there's something we're going
to have to be dealing with

91
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,640
sometime soon, and that's
the quality of the engineers

92
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,800
the camp's turning out.

93
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,150
With every multinational
looking to stake a claim,

94
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,650
there's a real shortage
of qualified personnel.

95
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,240
The captain of the Bycall was telling me

96
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,480
they have the same problem.

97
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,900
- I have to admit, I was
wondering why we always seem

98
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,440
to end up working with a
gang of incompetent amateurs

99
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,640
that act like they escaped
from a fraternity party.

100
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,830
- Just keep your blood
pressure down because they're

101
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,450
the employees of the mother
company, and we're here

102
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,420
to assist them on their mission.

103
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,840
Don't get bent out of
shape, we're interplanetary

104
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,340
taxi drivers, everybody else
is just along for the ride.

105
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,343
And speaking of which, I
think this one's it for me.

106
00:04:23,343 --> 00:04:25,938
- You're not thinking
of retiring, are you?

107
00:04:25,938 --> 00:04:30,130
- Yep, as a famous comic
book character once said,

108
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,753
I'm getting to old for this kinda shit.

109
00:04:32,753 --> 00:04:36,753
(deep, solemn orchestral music)

110
00:04:46,763 --> 00:04:50,680
(adventurous orchestral music)

111
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,186
(screeching)

112
00:05:33,186 --> 00:05:37,186
(mysterious, adventurous music)

113
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:17,875
(mysterious orchestral music)

114
00:06:32,323 --> 00:06:35,156
(screen clicking)

115
00:06:41,964 --> 00:06:45,047
(deep, solemn music)

116
00:06:53,524 --> 00:06:56,691
(spacecraft blasting)

117
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:10,099
(rumbling)

118
00:07:21,255 --> 00:07:24,505
(buzzing and whirring)

119
00:07:27,483 --> 00:07:29,922
(screen beeping)

120
00:07:29,922 --> 00:07:32,839
(mysterious music)

121
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:36,489
(screen beeping)

122
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:41,091
(hissing and roaring)

123
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,773
(deep, solemn music)

124
00:07:47,398 --> 00:07:48,998
(ringing)

125
00:07:48,998 --> 00:07:52,017
(whirring)

126
00:07:52,017 --> 00:07:55,017
(suspenseful music)

127
00:08:01,546 --> 00:08:03,713
(hissing)

128
00:08:24,493 --> 00:08:27,326
(liquid gurgling)

129
00:08:33,043 --> 00:08:35,210
(hissing)

130
00:08:53,143 --> 00:08:56,143
(deep, tense music)

131
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,943
(Lily screeching)

132
00:09:15,295 --> 00:09:18,254
(screen beeping)

133
00:09:18,254 --> 00:09:19,739
(whizzing)

134
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:21,989
(gurgling)

135
00:09:36,598 --> 00:09:40,431
(people yawning and groaning)

136
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,704
(Lily meowing)

137
00:09:47,704 --> 00:09:48,830
- There you are my baby,

138
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,680
I was so completely worried about you.

139
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,600
when I saw you weren't in
your capsule when I woke up.

140
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,433
- Morning, Guy.

141
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:56,720
- Hey, another day, another decade.

142
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,950
- As briefly as possible,
Wat, how are they?

143
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,250
- Well, they're all a
little wobbly on their pins,

144
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,273
but nothing out of the
ordinary for amateurs.

145
00:10:03,273 --> 00:10:05,830
- I think it's better if
we push the start time back

146
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,440
a little for the exploratory party.

147
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,588
And send some probes down to
pick up surface information.

148
00:10:10,588 --> 00:10:13,561
(blasting)

149
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:16,480
(beeping)

150
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,800
- Sir, I got something.

151
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,780
- Yeah, what's up?

152
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,730
- Looks like over 20
years ago we picked up

153
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,320
a priority transmission.

154
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,520
- What level was it?

155
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,010
- [Carolyn] Emergency level
sir, it came in 3 1/2 months

156
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,500
after leaving Earth orbit.

157
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,458
- All right, put it through,
let's get it over with.

158
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,208
(screen beeping)

159
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,880
- I am Syncam Corporation's
personnel manager,

160
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,640
interplanetary division, I have a message

161
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,080
of the upmost importance
for Mr. Mike Hamilton,

162
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,550
commanding officer of the starship Saldes.

163
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,573
I am switching to priority scramble now.

164
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,520
- Put him through, it'd
be impossible to keep

165
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,573
anything secret on a ship this small.

166
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,610
- Captain Hamilton, I'm afraid I have some

167
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,320
rather unpleasant news to report.

168
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,180
It appears that you have two people aboard

169
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,540
who are not who they claim to be,

170
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,970
nor are they employees of Syncam.

171
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,660
Evidently, they managed to
enter the training program

172
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,597
at the center with false identification,

173
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:08,760
and then joined the crew on your ship.

174
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,663
We've investigated this of course.

175
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,693
I have their names and
photos, which I'll put up

176
00:11:12,693 --> 00:11:16,100
at end of the transmission,
but captain I must emphasize

177
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,371
the grave (muffled by
TV static) immediately.

178
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:18,602
(TV static buzzing)

179
00:11:18,602 --> 00:11:19,435
- Hm?

180
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,260
- The rest has been erased, captain.

181
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,054
- How are we suppose
to identify these bums

182
00:11:24,054 --> 00:11:26,310
if we haven't even got a picture of 'em?

183
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,390
- I just don't see how a
bunch of people who work for

184
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:31,060
the same company wouldn't be
able to recognize an imposter.

185
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,750
You'd think they'd pick up on
who the fakes were right away.

186
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,670
- That'd be impossible, sir.

187
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,010
- Impossible?

188
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,320
- Syncam Corporation's a
multinational conglomerate

189
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,110
with affiliates all
over the world, captain,

190
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,040
so when they put a crew
together those people

191
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,720
could come from Japan,
Italy, France, Australia,

192
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,640
it'd be impossible for
them to know each other.

193
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,530
- So the first time any of
them ever met each other

194
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,960
would be at the space training center.

195
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,200
No reason for anybody to think

196
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,530
anything was weird about them.

197
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,900
- Right, and having cleared
personnel checkpoints,

198
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,270
the ID card would be
their only identification.

199
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,690
- They were certainly
well prepared in advance.

200
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,960
- To leave the capsules
early and erase the message,

201
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,750
they'd have to be a systems expert.

202
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,360
- You mean they came out of
deep sleep, checked the message,

203
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,720
and got back to the
capsules before we woke up?

204
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,560
- Yes.

205
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,830
- And of course they erased
all the good parts, but what

206
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,160
I don't get is why they
didn't wipe the whole thing.

207
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,660
- Well, if they monkeyed the
timers on their own hibernators

208
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,480
I suppose they could
figure a way to screw up

209
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,640
that transmission, but
maybe there's some sort of

210
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,810
time limit they were under to do the job.

211
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,370
- I can't imagine what it'd be.

212
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,600
- We can't let them run
around free on the ship.

213
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,290
- Nobody's crazy enough to
go on a 40 year round trip

214
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,700
to some rock in the middle of nowhere

215
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,560
just to play Robinson Crusoe.

216
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,870
- Time jumpers, we're dealing with

217
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,620
a couple of criminals sir, that's it.

218
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,410
- He's probably right,
captain, once in awhile

219
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,760
these guys fake their way
onto a starship so they can

220
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,070
spend 40 or 50 years hibernating in space

221
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,290
without getting much older.

222
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,500
When they get back to Earth,
no one's around anymore

223
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,100
to remember their crime.

224
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,050
- They wouldn't have a
snowball's chance in hell

225
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,630
of pulling it off if we didn't
have the deep sleep capsules,

226
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,350
but this way they can start
from scratch to make new crimes,

227
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,750
it's a pretty slick way
of beatin' the system.

228
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,160
- Some time jumpers, just great.

229
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,010
- We gotta do it.

230
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,240
- We have to do what?

231
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,750
- We need to find who the jumpers are

232
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,300
and put 'em in custody.

233
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,540
- You've got to be kidding,
on a ship this size

234
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,720
we're all prisoners, just let
'em be, it's not that serious.

235
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,320
Besides, there's not much
we can do about it anyhow.

236
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,093
Here they come now.

237
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,513
- Ah-ha, hello there, captain.

238
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,130
Or perhaps I should say, good morning.

239
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,430
At any rate, allow me to introduce myself.

240
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,290
I'm Harris Mead, and I've been
assigned as ship's doctor.

241
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,520
- Dr. Mead, welcome, I'm glad to see

242
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,760
you're feeling all right.

243
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,790
Since none of you appear
to be the worse for wear

244
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:38,070
after your sleep, let me
explain our present situation.

245
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:41,490
We're orbiting LA003 after
an elapsed Earth time

246
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,530
of 20 years, one month, and 10 days.

247
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:49,530
We're at quota 34,000, and our
speed is 17,000 kilometers.

248
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,360
You'll build a temporary
command base to investigate

249
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,930
resources available for
possible utilization

250
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,200
by the corporation, and facilitate--

251
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,540
- Captain, the temperature
at number four block

252
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,780
is dropping rapidly.

253
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,658
- All right Carolyn, put it on the screen.

254
00:14:01,658 --> 00:14:04,658
(adventurous music)

255
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,650
Hold it, go back.

256
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,341
Dammit, an AC duct's been
damaged and frozen air

257
00:14:11,341 --> 00:14:12,710
is spilling into the block.

258
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,310
Dular, take a couple of
them and repair it, come on.

259
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,000
What's your name?

260
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,100
- My last name's Takagi, Tokyo affiliate.

261
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,380
- And how 'bout you,
big guy, what's yours?

262
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,700
- Morgan W. Scott, and I'm
from the home office, captain.

263
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,020
- That's fine, I want
you boys to help Dular

264
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,370
in taking care of that busted AC deck.

265
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,980
Oh and you can leave your weapon with me,

266
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,126
it won't be necessary.

267
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:37,510
- I don't know captain, I
feel strange without it.

268
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,612
- No worries, mate, give it to me.

269
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,695
(footsteps clicking)

270
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,420
- [Man] There, you see, I told
you they wouldn't match up.

271
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,390
- [Man] Okay, but since the
spectometer readings were

272
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,440
the same, it really doesn't
make that much difference.

273
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,620
- [Man] How can you say that,
you never even looked at

274
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,615
the gas chromatograph for a comparison.

275
00:14:57,615 --> 00:14:58,570
- [Man] So what, lighten up.

276
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,900
- Captain.
- I'm sorry.

277
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,502
- Something's odd but--

278
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:02,340
- What's on your mind?

279
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,410
- Well I was going through
some of the old back up data

280
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,520
and this is going to sound strange,

281
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,980
but the remote manipulator tore that duct.

282
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,750
- The remote manipulator,
you sure about it?

283
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,180
- I still haven't figured out
how they managed to get in.

284
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,180
But I do know one thing,
while we were asleep,

285
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,814
somebody reprogrammed it.

286
00:15:17,814 --> 00:15:18,944
- (gasping) Hm?

287
00:15:18,944 --> 00:15:20,011
- Huh?

288
00:15:20,011 --> 00:15:24,290
- (laughing loudly) That's
great, so then what happened?

289
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,010
- Nothing happened, that's it.

290
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,280
- [Morgan] What? (laughing)

291
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,470
- Wonder which ones

292
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,303
it could be.
- You sure know

293
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,136
how to kill a joke.

294
00:15:31,136 --> 00:15:33,017
- You think Wat's idea holds water?

295
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:34,073
- [Woman At Other Table] I liked it.

296
00:15:34,073 --> 00:15:34,906
- I don't know.

297
00:15:34,906 --> 00:15:37,420
- We'll never know their plans,
only if one of them talks.

298
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,423
- I'm sure we could find a way
to make these thugs open up.

299
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,310
Right, Guy?

300
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,320
- Listen man, we're not the damn military.

301
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,920
This mission's startin' to bug me already.

302
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,360
- You know, we could interview them all

303
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,200
and then run their stories
through the computer

304
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,770
for discrepancies in
their personal history.

305
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,510
- Nobody'd ever go for it, and besides,

306
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,370
It'd violate their rights to privacy.

307
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,530
I'd prefer it if everybody
just left it alone

308
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,810
and took care of the ship's business

309
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,454
instead of playing private eye.

310
00:16:00,454 --> 00:16:01,970
(Lily yelling)

311
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,450
- That goddamn cat is nuts.

312
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,980
- Hey, I warned you not to bother her.

313
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,891
- Uh!

314
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:09,065
- (gasping) Come back, Lily.

315
00:16:09,065 --> 00:16:11,468
(clicking tongue)

316
00:16:11,468 --> 00:16:13,170
(Lily meowing)

317
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,930
- Pretty fond of cats are you?

318
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,766
- I suppose I am, they're
a lot better than a dog.

319
00:16:19,766 --> 00:16:22,870
- Hey, but I love dogs myself.

320
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,933
- Got that right.

321
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,500
I've got 10 of them at home in Florida,

322
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,798
and I'm proud of them all.

323
00:16:28,798 --> 00:16:31,140
(Lily meowing)

324
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,402
- Thank you, Hiro.

325
00:16:32,402 --> 00:16:33,235
- Yeah.

326
00:16:33,235 --> 00:16:36,630
- Aw, this thing's
killing my nose, see ya.

327
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,660
Hey captain, when are
we gonna get to work?

328
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,620
Things are gettin' boring.

329
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,960
- We can't do much of anything

330
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,610
before we analyze the probe's information.

331
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,570
You'll have plenty to do after that.

332
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,640
- I hope so, 'cause I
don't wanna be cooped up

333
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,240
in this tin can for too
long, I'll go bananas.

334
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,203
- Oh, you wanna put some money on that?

335
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,330
- It's obvious nobody's
been around this part

336
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:05,587
of the ship in years,
couple of hundred of 'em.

337
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:23,803
Mm.

338
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:29,711
(static buzzing)

339
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,216
(clanking)

340
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:38,966
(deep, suspenseful music)

341
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,170
Who's there?

342
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,640
- Well, it oughta be done by now.

343
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,250
Carolyn, you put together the probe data.

344
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,050
You two take the transport ship,

345
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,103
give it a complete diagnostic.

346
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,960
- [Wat] Okay, maybe you're
right, suppose Morgan is

347
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,830
one of the two jumpers, who
do you think is the other one?

348
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,100
- I'm almost positive
it's that Jimmy dork.

349
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,530
- Oh yeah, nah, it's probably
that Hong Kong woman,

350
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,680
what's her name, um--

351
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,513
- [Guy] Dorothy, no way.

352
00:18:24,513 --> 00:18:25,346
- How do you know?

353
00:18:25,346 --> 00:18:27,030
- 'Cause, she's my kinda woman.

354
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,034
- [Wat] Now there's a hell of a reason.

355
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:32,932
(Guy and Wat laughing)

356
00:18:32,932 --> 00:18:35,151
(man yelling)

357
00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:40,151
(man breathing heavily)
(alarm blaring)

358
00:18:41,137 --> 00:18:43,236
(gasping)
(meowing)

359
00:18:43,236 --> 00:18:44,069
- Lily.

360
00:18:47,134 --> 00:18:49,884
(dramatic music)

361
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:57,490
(drumming music)
(breathing heavily)

362
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,872
(machine beeping)

363
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,300
- Captain, if I didn't
know better, I'd swear

364
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,120
he suffocated from Legionnaires' Disease..

365
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,080
His lungs are full of bacteria.

366
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,060
- Bacteria, how can that be
if the ship was sterilized?

367
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,780
- I never said that the
bacteria were from Earth.

368
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,230
Take a look inside his lungs, fascinating.

369
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,950
I've never seen anything move like that.

370
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,790
I'll be able to come up
with more information

371
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,060
once I've run a few tests.

372
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,260
Of course I'll have to
admit I'm a little surprised

373
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,030
I've been given my own job to do so soon.

374
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:37,050
- [Mike] Wat, Guy stem to stern
check of the transport ship.

375
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,360
I want all the rest of you to check

376
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,110
the main ship in two groups.

377
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,050
- Tell us what's going on.

378
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,930
- I'm not completely
positive, but something

379
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,280
was brought into this ship.

380
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,260
And some kind of deadly bacteria
were brought in with it.

381
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,000
Half of you go over number four block,

382
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,847
and the others check the
gangway where Morgan was found.

383
00:19:52,847 --> 00:19:55,847
(adventurous music)

384
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,040
- Victim number one and 12 to go.

385
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,178
- Told you I had a bad feeling.

386
00:20:08,178 --> 00:20:11,178
(adventurous music)

387
00:20:24,135 --> 00:20:24,968
- Hm?

388
00:20:27,162 --> 00:20:32,162
(laughing) Come here little
pussy cat. (clicking tongue)

389
00:20:34,486 --> 00:20:35,903
Yes, that a girl.

390
00:20:36,898 --> 00:20:39,593
- (groaning) Not a thing, captain.

391
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,513
Thanks.

392
00:21:01,614 --> 00:21:04,973
- (sighing) How the hell could
anything get into the ship?

393
00:21:06,621 --> 00:21:10,320
Hm, just what do you think
you're doing, Mr. Berry?

394
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,090
- I told him not to touch it.

395
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,830
- Ah, don't blame her
captain, she did what she was

396
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,070
suppose to, I was only
wondering if there were

397
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,270
any messages from my family,
but what do you know,

398
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,030
look what I found instead.

399
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,510
- I am Syncam Corporation's
personnel manager,

400
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,010
interplanetary division, I
have a message of the utmost

401
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,540
importance for Mr. Mike
Hamilton, commanding officer

402
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,938
of the starship Saldes,
I am switching to--

403
00:21:29,938 --> 00:21:30,771
(computer beeping)

404
00:21:30,771 --> 00:21:32,540
- He claims that there
are two people on board

405
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,840
with false identification.

406
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:36,426
Then the most important
part of the message,

407
00:21:36,426 --> 00:21:39,120
the part with the names on it, was erased.

408
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,020
You wouldn't happen to
have any explanation

409
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,410
for that, would you?

410
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,860
- As a matter of fact, I
don't have any explanation.

411
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,100
But if we don't destroy what
was brought aboard this ship,

412
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,110
it's not going to make
much difference anyway.

413
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,040
- Come on now, captain, we've both got

414
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,836
bigger fish to fry, so to waste time--

415
00:21:52,836 --> 00:21:55,783
- Captain, come to
sickbay, Dr. Mead is dead.

416
00:21:55,783 --> 00:21:58,533
(dramatic music)

417
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,750
- [Walt] Same as Morgan, sir.

418
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,390
- Wonder where he picked up the infection,

419
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,130
from Morgan or somewhere else.

420
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:11,730
Dammit, alien bacteria and no doctor.

421
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,040
- [Dick] It's like I said,
the first thing we have to do

422
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,259
is to find who those two people are.

423
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:18,080
(computer beeping)

424
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,380
- [Walt] Nationality?

425
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,430
- [Farrah] Hong Kong.

426
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,580
- Date of birth?

427
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,747
(gasping)

428
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,500
Come on Dorothy, I'm not
thrilled with this either,

429
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,260
but since all of you agreed,
we have to go through with it.

430
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,350
Date of birth please.

431
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,313
- I was born on May 10, 2241.

432
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,609
- You're 23?

433
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:39,456
(gasping)

434
00:22:39,456 --> 00:22:41,090
- Education?

435
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,460
- I graduated from Washington University.

436
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,390
- And had a baby while you were at it.

437
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,520
Now that's the kinda higher
education that really

438
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,970
builds your brain muscle, eh?

439
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,590
- Hm, just what do you think you're--

440
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,700
- Berry, shut up, now let's continue.

441
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,720
- You prying son of a bitch!

442
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,090
We all have something we
don't wanna tell anybody.

443
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:01,220
We wanna keep our lives secret,
but if I knew what yours was

444
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,690
I wouldn't laugh about that.

445
00:23:04,486 --> 00:23:06,550
- That's a fairly pretty speech.

446
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,396
I think for the good of the
corporation, your turn's up.

447
00:23:09,396 --> 00:23:12,990
(grumbling and sighing)

448
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:17,170
- Carolyn, any word on the
transport ship's status?

449
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,960
We'll be at our first landing
point in under an hour.

450
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,710
- [Carolyn] But sir, Guy and
Wat haven't reported in yet.

451
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,543
- They what?

452
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,020
- [Walt] Nationality?

453
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:31,032
(adventurous music)

454
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,910
- Give me a look inside the hangar.

455
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:41,090
Wat, Guy, come in, what's
the transport ship's status?

456
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:43,743
- [Carolyn] Uh, just a second
captain, let me zoom in on it.

457
00:23:43,743 --> 00:23:46,493
(dramatic music)

458
00:23:47,414 --> 00:23:49,682
(sighing)

459
00:23:49,682 --> 00:23:52,682
(adventurous music)

460
00:23:56,007 --> 00:23:57,670
- I'm afraid we're
going to have to give up

461
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,240
our first landing position.

462
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,250
- Any idea how long
it'll be before we reach

463
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,968
the second point, captain?

464
00:24:02,968 --> 00:24:04,550
- [Mike] Yeah, three hours.

465
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,500
- [Walt] Do you want us to continue

466
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,240
the background checks until then?

467
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,310
- [Mike] Now that we've started,

468
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,943
everyone has to go through it.

469
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,280
- Lily?

470
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,113
Lily?

471
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,470
Could you give me a hand?

472
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,303
- My pleasure.

473
00:24:17,303 --> 00:24:20,240
- I hope you two realize,
we're not on a bleedin' picnic

474
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,790
here, you come straight
back after you've found her.

475
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,439
And next time, put a string
on so you'll stop losing her,

476
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:26,430
do you hear that I'm saying?

477
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,783
Otherwise, I'll put one round her neck.

478
00:24:35,944 --> 00:24:38,194
(clunking)

479
00:24:40,123 --> 00:24:42,020
- [Nancy] I don't believe
it, he is so mean.

480
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,780
- I wonder why none of
them seem to have anything

481
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,040
better to do that to look into

482
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,370
other people's private secrets.

483
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,140
- Well, company loyalty's very important,

484
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,240
it has to be insured somehow.

485
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,073
Lily!

486
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,560
- If she were alive, she'd
be around your age now.

487
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,393
- Huh?

488
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,547
- [Hiro] Nothin', I'll
look around this way.

489
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,663
- Lily!

490
00:25:12,236 --> 00:25:13,406
Lily?

491
00:25:13,406 --> 00:25:16,906
(light, rhythmic banging)

492
00:25:19,794 --> 00:25:21,961
(gasping)

493
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,993
There you are.

494
00:25:32,035 --> 00:25:34,952
(mysterious music)

495
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,853
Lily!

496
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,340
- Jimmy Mengel, you've got
a drug conviction here.

497
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,330
- Huh, but I never touched
that stuff in my life, Dick.

498
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,310
- Well, the company records
show you were placed

499
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,670
on probation for some kind
of drug bust when you were

500
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,080
in high school, what've you got to say?

501
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,360
- Wait a minute, wait a minute,
they've got it all wrong.

502
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,950
I can remember perfectly what happened.

503
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,870
It wasn't me, it was one
of the guys in my class

504
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:02,960
with me, Jimmy Hengle.

505
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,030
I can't believe they still have
it on the records like that.

506
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,400
Jimmy Hengle was arrested for
drugs in high school, not me.

507
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,950
They were always mixing up the two of us,

508
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:11,470
calling me Hengel and him
Mengel, it was terrible!

509
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:14,490
- Do you expect us to believe
and excuse like that, Jimmy?

510
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,800
- Even the police can make
a mistake inputting data.

511
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,500
Why should I be the one
to suffer for something

512
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,943
that I never had anything to do with?

513
00:26:19,943 --> 00:26:22,210
- Well, that was all we were able to find

514
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,850
in your entire record.

515
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,850
None of it has any bearing on
what we're looking for anyway.

516
00:26:27,972 --> 00:26:29,822
What happened to that Japanese fella?

517
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,530
- Captain Hamilton!

518
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,880
- Well, well, speak of the
devil, here he comes now.

519
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,950
- Yes, what is it?

520
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,780
- Come to sickbay right now, sir.

521
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,493
All the bodies have vanished.

522
00:26:38,493 --> 00:26:41,493
(adventurous music)

523
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:52,032
- Hm, damnedest thing I've ever seen,

524
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,240
disappearing into thin air like that,

525
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,250
leaving only their clothes behind 'em.

526
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,010
- And just why were you in sick bay?

527
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:00,400
- Uh, I was here looking for the cat.

528
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,620
- Oh I'm sure it's only
me who thinks it's funny

529
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,980
you happened to come
here looking for a cat

530
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,071
you knew you wouldn't find.

531
00:27:07,071 --> 00:27:10,071
(adventurous music)

532
00:27:12,396 --> 00:27:14,290
- Lily, come back.

533
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,957
(alarm blaring)

534
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:24,033
(yelling and crying)

535
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,532
- Nancy, what happened?

536
00:27:28,532 --> 00:27:30,865
(crumbling)

537
00:27:36,025 --> 00:27:38,541
(Lily yelling)

538
00:27:38,541 --> 00:27:40,160
(people gasping)

539
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,743
(Lily moaning)

540
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:45,287
- No!

541
00:27:48,731 --> 00:27:51,814
- Oh my, what in blazes is happening?

542
00:27:53,012 --> 00:27:55,679
(deep gurgling)

543
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,790
- It's been completely destroyed by rust.

544
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:07,850
- The wall's made of solid
super alloy, it's impossible.

545
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,520
It's got to be somethin' else, but--

546
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,840
- Bacteria, I'm positive it's
been eroded by that bacteria.

547
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,547
- Yeah, but if it's--

548
00:28:14,547 --> 00:28:18,130
(man yelling and groaning)

549
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:21,542
(rumbling)

550
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,490
- What can we do, sir?

551
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,000
- Since we've got absolutely nothing

552
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,350
on this bacteria, what can we do?

553
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,490
We'll lock this block off
for possible infection

554
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,403
and retreat to the main bridge,
come on everybody, move it!

555
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:45,750
(rapid, adventurous music)

556
00:28:57,141 --> 00:28:59,391
(blasting)

557
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:07,090
- Do you think we've escaped
the buggers, captain?

558
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,520
- I hope so.

559
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,840
- We're coming up awfully fast on our

560
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,360
second landing point, sir.

561
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,540
- Oh yeah, we still have our jobs to do.

562
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,840
The transport ship, why
don't you cover that

563
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,900
with Dular, and the hangar bays will both

564
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,490
need to be decontaminated.

565
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,712
- You ready to go?
- Plus we have to select

566
00:29:22,712 --> 00:29:23,545
six members for the
- Let's go.

567
00:29:23,545 --> 00:29:25,890
- exploratory probe, since
Walt and Dular are going

568
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,120
to be two of them, you better choose

569
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,710
the other four from among yourselves.

570
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,980
- We've plenty of time to do that in yet.

571
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,720
We still have our little game of checkin'

572
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,647
the backgrounds of the people from Syncam.

573
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,828
And that means Nancy and that
fellow from Japan, obviously.

574
00:29:37,828 --> 00:29:40,880
- (gasping) How dare you
even think of suspecting me?

575
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,680
- Morgan from headquarters
knew who you were,

576
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,120
but I'm from the Australian
branch and I only met you

577
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,900
for the very first time here.

578
00:30:01,356 --> 00:30:05,356
(computer buzzing and whirring)

579
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,587
(sighing)

580
00:30:23,402 --> 00:30:26,069
(light buzzing)

581
00:30:28,341 --> 00:30:31,924
(rapid electronic beeping)

582
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:44,639
(sighing)

583
00:30:44,639 --> 00:30:47,639
(computer whirring)

584
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:01,377
(yelling)

585
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:06,900
- I cannot believe it, wait'll
my dad hears about this.

586
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,860
- Hey, I hope you find your criminals.

587
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,590
- Don't worry, I will.

588
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,587
You little smart ass, I'll find 'em.

589
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,710
(cocking gun)

590
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,510
- Well, painful as you
thought it would be?

591
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:20,890
- [Nancy] Way worse, you
cannot believe how mean he is.

592
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:23,410
- What if the company'd been
given rotten information.

593
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,910
And that guy's message was
nothing but a lousy fake,

594
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,280
they wouldn't try to drive us crazy

595
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,730
for no reason, would they?

596
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:29,759
- You don't think--

597
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:31,291
(gasping)

598
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:33,410
- Hey, anybody seen Dorothy?

599
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,590
- She hasn't been on the bridge,

600
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,830
I thought she was with you two.

601
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,340
- Um, no.
- Huh?

602
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,180
- She might be, she could be in sickbay.

603
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,820
- Sick bay?
- I--

604
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,430
- Now what would she be doin' there mate,

605
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:47,560
if I may ask, and how
would you know about it?

606
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,510
- Well, Mr. Berry, perhaps you
should ask her that yourself.

607
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,150
Or better yet, why don't the both of us

608
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,740
go see what she's doing?

609
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,010
- Listen, mate,

610
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,580
you be real careful, how you--
- Captain, look!

611
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,413
- What is it?

612
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:02,820
Why in the hell is the
hangar deck opening?

613
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,653
Carolyn what--

614
00:32:03,653 --> 00:32:05,600
- My commands are being
overwritten by the motherboard,

615
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,500
captain, I have nothing to do with it.

616
00:32:08,868 --> 00:32:12,520
(gasping) Sir, I, my control
board's been cut off.

617
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,353
- What?

618
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:15,823
- [Carolyn] We can no longer

619
00:32:15,823 --> 00:32:17,773
control the ship from the bridge.

620
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,293
- Dular, Walt, get your asses
out of there, do you hear me?

621
00:32:21,293 --> 00:32:23,060
This is a full-on emergency.

622
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,585
I want you to get off of
the hangar deck immediately.

623
00:32:25,585 --> 00:32:28,085
(tense music)

624
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:35,385
(yelling)

625
00:32:35,385 --> 00:32:38,385
(adventurous music)

626
00:32:41,442 --> 00:32:42,528
- Oh-oh!

627
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:45,528
(adventurous music)

628
00:32:50,498 --> 00:32:51,637
(groaning)

629
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:54,637
(adventurous music)

630
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,140
(swishing)

631
00:33:11,537 --> 00:33:13,484
(exploding)

632
00:33:13,484 --> 00:33:16,234
(screen beeping)

633
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,100
- It's been deactivated, it won't unlock.

634
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,460
Who's in there?

635
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,220
Who hasn't been accounted for other than

636
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,590
the first four casualties
and the rest of us here?

637
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,570
- Well the gal from Hong
Kong, what's her name,

638
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,420
she hasn't been seen around for awhile.

639
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,440
I'll bet big money it's
probably here in there.

640
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,040
- I'm telling you, she's not in there.

641
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,540
- What makes you so
almighty sure of yourself?

642
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,990
You know an awful lot about
the doings of other people.

643
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,950
Perhaps you can explain it to me.

644
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,113
- Yeah, if I can.

645
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,920
There's no other way, Captain Hamilton,

646
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,965
come with me please sir.

647
00:34:00,965 --> 00:34:03,965
(adventurous music)

648
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,280
- Disappeared like the rest of 'em.

649
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,610
What's happening here?

650
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,420
- She was checking the
pathology of her lungs

651
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,380
with the x-ray scanner by herself.

652
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,670
- How'd you figure that out?

653
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,399
- It wasn't tough, because I,

654
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:21,930
because someone had done
the same thing in here.

655
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,900
- You mean besides you, eh?

656
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,850
Come off it, Hiro, that business
about looking for the cat

657
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:28,760
and finding the bodies
was a bunch of crap.

658
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,040
- What do you have to say about that?

659
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,490
- Yes, I was using the x-ray scanner.

660
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:35,520
I was afraid that the
bacteria had already invaded

661
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,183
our bodies, and that was the
only way I had to make sure.

662
00:34:38,183 --> 00:34:39,940
(gasping)

663
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,760
I remembered something Dr. Mead had said

664
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,640
when he was examining Morgan.

665
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,610
He thought something about
it was very familiar.

666
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,530
It reminded him of Legionnaires' Disease,

667
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:50,393
or a strain similar to that one.

668
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,010
He told me the last
outbreak was years ago.

669
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,665
Some veterans were at a
convention, 12 hours later,

670
00:34:56,665 --> 00:35:00,035
they began dropping like
flies for no reason.

671
00:35:00,035 --> 00:35:02,070
Their lungs were filled with bacteria,

672
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:04,000
which caused them all to suffocate.

673
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,990
- Could it be the same
thing that infected Morgan?

674
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:09,380
- [Hiro] I can't be sure,
but the disease that killed

675
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,260
those veterans was caused by
the hotel's air conditioners.

676
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,940
That's what started me
thinking, the bacteria were

677
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,220
piped directly into every
room through the AC ducts.

678
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,053
- And then?

679
00:35:19,053 --> 00:35:20,440
- Well, we know there was a damaged duct

680
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,370
in the number four section, okay.

681
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,060
How do we know something
couldn't have come through

682
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,900
that hole and into the ship?

683
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,733
- [Man] Oh my god.

684
00:35:26,733 --> 00:35:27,910
- And suppose that something was

685
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:29,587
some kind of alien bacteria.

686
00:35:29,587 --> 00:35:31,837
(swishing)

687
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,790
If it were strong enough,
it could've passed untouched

688
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:42,190
through the water separation
tanks and filters.

689
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,753
And then, it'd be a cinch
for it to penetrate inside--

690
00:35:44,753 --> 00:35:46,650
- Into the entire ventilation matrix

691
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:49,395
where it could infiltrate
the ship's air supply!

692
00:35:49,395 --> 00:35:51,562
(blowing)

693
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,740
- I think depending on
the physical environment,

694
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,410
it won't survive everywhere
on board the Saldes,

695
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:02,757
and that's uh, I think
that's why Dorothy came here.

696
00:36:02,757 --> 00:36:04,360
- [Nancy] Uh, I don't wanna hear this!

697
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,060
- Yeah, but what happened to all of 'em?

698
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,670
Did the bacteria eat 'em?

699
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,410
- I don't think we'll ever know that.

700
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,540
There are bacteria that'll
metabolize on Earth

701
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,130
in a short period of
time, but no terrestrial

702
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,420
aerobic bacteria that I'm
aware of can completely

703
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,900
dissolve a set of human
bones without a trace.

704
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,410
- Very intriguing, medical man, eh?

705
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:22,243
- It's a hobby.

706
00:36:22,243 --> 00:36:25,420
- Now that's funny, something
just doesn't seem right.

707
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,030
Maybe it's 'cause company
data have Mr. Hiro Takagi

708
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,620
specialized in space
engineering and not medicine.

709
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,070
I guess they must've gotten
things all backwards.

710
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,530
- Huh, yeah, now I think I got it.

711
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,060
I don't know why I didn't pick it up.

712
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,100
You're not an employee
of the corporation either

713
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,750
now, are you, you're a detective.

714
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:46,710
- Huh?

715
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,900
- All I ever said was
that medicine was a hobby.

716
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,340
I don't remember saying
that I specialized in it.

717
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,600
What do you have up your sleeve?

718
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,500
- The game's done kid, you
shouldn't have said either.

719
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,760
- Very good, Mr. Detective,
your patience has been rewarded.

720
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,510
You found the mad gunman who murdered

721
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,197
those three men on King Street.

722
00:37:02,197 --> 00:37:03,108
(gasping)

723
00:37:03,108 --> 00:37:05,630
I figured I was safe hiding
on a starship for 40 years.

724
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,400
I never thought you'd be willing
to tail me quite this far.

725
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,410
- Thanks for the
confession, I appreciate it.

726
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,720
When everything goes well
in those rare moments,

727
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,010
it's nice to see your efforts rewarded.

728
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,600
- Just a minute, you
can't arrest him here.

729
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,980
- Normally you'd have a point there.

730
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,810
I usually leave everything
up to the captain of the ship

731
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:24,537
since whatever happens during
the run is under his command.

732
00:37:24,537 --> 00:37:26,530
Oh, I don't much care to
get involved with the stuff

733
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:28,150
that doesn't concern me directly.

734
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,510
But our jobs here are different, captain.

735
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,550
Yours is to bring the ship home.

736
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,890
However, my responsibility is to bring

737
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:36,273
this here bad guy home.

738
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,040
- I assume that message then from

739
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,970
the personnel manager was your trick?

740
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,970
- Oh I'm afraid it was at that.

741
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,880
The company was very cooperative.

742
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,080
When I was first given
this file, the only bit

743
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,920
of information I had was the
murderer was a medical student

744
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,270
who'd escaped to the moon
on a false Syncam ID card.

745
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,360
That message was my one last hope.

746
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,680
- If this were any kind of
a normal situation, I'd have

747
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,540
nothing at all to say about
how the affair was handled.

748
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,270
But take a word of advice,
if I were you, I'd certainly

749
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,520
have my lungs checked for
any trace of bacteria.

750
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,246
- Huh, come on, captain, being a detective

751
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:11,540
I've run up against trouble
a hell of a lot worse

752
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,230
than some outer space chicken pox.

753
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:16,030
I'm talkin' about your armed
gangs with submachine guns

754
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:18,830
and high tech explosives,
and pissed off to boot.

755
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,600
Now, you just may be right,
my body could be riddled

756
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,740
with the stuff, and so perhaps
I'll snuff out like Morgan.

757
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,570
But as of this moment, I'm still alive.

758
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,220
And so is this murdering bastard!

759
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,930
And as long as I'm alive,
it's my responsibility

760
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,610
to get him back to Earth for trial.

761
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,760
He's the criminal and
I have to arrest him.

762
00:38:37,713 --> 00:38:38,640
- You're far too young.

763
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,150
- What do you mean, I'm too young?

764
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:43,210
Well I've gotta be the
same age as you, captain.

765
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:46,150
- You think so, how old am I then?

766
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,587
- Uh--

767
00:38:47,587 --> 00:38:48,943
- How 'bout her?

768
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:57,610
I just passed 240, Carolyn
is 150 years old, right?

769
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,573
- I'm 151.

770
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:00,935
- [Group] Huh?

771
00:39:04,562 --> 00:39:05,395
(gasping)

772
00:39:05,395 --> 00:39:07,940
- Wat, Guy, Walt, Dular,
they were all of them,

773
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:11,010
anywhere between 150 and 200 years old

774
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,173
if you go by Earth time computation.

775
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,270
Space navigation isn't really everything

776
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,350
it's cracked up to be.

777
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,890
Thanks to the ship's
cryohibernation system,

778
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:24,050
our bodies don't get much
older with every trip.

779
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:26,400
Well at least not physically, that is.

780
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,310
The trouble starts when we
return from a voyage in space.

781
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:33,110
Everyone's thrilled to be
home, till they realize

782
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,670
that 40, 50, or 60 years have elapsed

783
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,470
back where they came from.

784
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:41,920
You become, I was so
excited by my first voyage.

785
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,970
I got back to Earth and met my
son, who I'd left as a baby,

786
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:48,560
he'd grown into a man older than I was.

787
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,520
But not even that could
kill the fascination for me.

788
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,540
No, that died after the second trip.

789
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:58,020
There was no more reason
to come home, all my family

790
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,060
and friends were long dead.

791
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,220
But even more than that,
I can't catch up with

792
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,296
the new age, new science, new theories,

793
00:40:04,296 --> 00:40:06,720
a flood of new information.

794
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,790
People treated me like a living fossil

795
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:11,620
and I realized, I'm an anachronism,

796
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:14,610
not quite useless, but
annoying to have around.

797
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,460
So I escaped back into space

798
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,610
and returned to a different new age.

799
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,820
I've done it many times.

800
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,034
It doesn't really matter
what I tell you after all,

801
00:40:23,034 --> 00:40:25,380
you can go ahead and bring
him back for his trial,

802
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:28,010
but you'll find out, you'll
experience it for yourself.

803
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:30,306
There'll be nobody left to
welcome you except the computer

804
00:40:30,306 --> 00:40:33,587
keeping records of a crime
committed 40 years ago.

805
00:40:40,783 --> 00:40:43,990
(tense music)

806
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,171
- Dorothy?

807
00:40:45,171 --> 00:40:47,338
(blowing)

808
00:40:49,688 --> 00:40:50,709
(monstrous yelling)

809
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:51,542
(yelling)

810
00:40:51,542 --> 00:40:52,735
- [Hiro] What is it?

811
00:40:52,735 --> 00:40:54,582
(Nancy crying out)

812
00:40:54,582 --> 00:40:57,832
(swishing and howling)

813
00:40:58,871 --> 00:40:59,704
(gun cocking)

814
00:40:59,704 --> 00:41:00,537
- Don't shoot it.

815
00:41:00,537 --> 00:41:02,231
(gun firing)

816
00:41:02,231 --> 00:41:03,877
(dramatic music)

817
00:41:03,877 --> 00:41:06,460
(Dick yelling)

818
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,140
Because we've got gravity generators

819
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,003
doesn't mean you can blast
away anytime you feel like it.

820
00:41:15,325 --> 00:41:16,930
- What the bloody hell was that?

821
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:18,930
- You're telling me that
thing got into the ship

822
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,880
along with the bacteria?

823
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,910
- Could be, anyway, whoever or
whatever has locked us out of

824
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:27,340
the control room knows a lot
more about it than we do.

825
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:30,669
Carolyn, Jimmy, you
come along with me too.

826
00:41:30,669 --> 00:41:31,502
- [Jimmy] Um-hm.

827
00:41:31,502 --> 00:41:32,930
- Hiro, since you know some medicine,

828
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,900
take care of Dick, all right?

829
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,060
Take off his handcuffs and be very happy

830
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,570
you're already in sickbay.

831
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:45,600
(screen beeping)

832
00:41:50,502 --> 00:41:52,797
I'll have to cut the
door, wait for me here,

833
00:41:52,797 --> 00:41:55,280
I'm going to rig a torch
in the engine room.

834
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,783
- Uh, I know some
welding, let me help you.

835
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,772
(screen beeping)

836
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:33,917
(rumbling)

837
00:42:37,258 --> 00:42:39,425
(roaring)

838
00:42:55,723 --> 00:42:57,973
(growling)

839
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:09,880
It's probably too late
to regret this but uh,

840
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,490
I shouldn't have volunteered
for this mission,

841
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:13,330
I must've been crazy or something.

842
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:17,090
If I were on Earth right
now, I'd probably be happy,

843
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:19,633
married, and teaching elementary school.

844
00:43:20,524 --> 00:43:23,040
(groaning) I was never fairly
evaluated by the company,

845
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,773
and I never got any of the
promotions I put in for.

846
00:43:25,773 --> 00:43:28,900
I did my best, but I wasn't
getting anywhere, you know.

847
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,033
- I've met a few others who felt the same.

848
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,180
- Then the home office
announced this mission.

849
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:37,230
They tried to recruit crew
members but nobody was buying it.

850
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:40,010
Some people just have better
instincts about this stuff.

851
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:42,000
The pay they were offering was terrific,

852
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,230
but it made you really
think, how much money

853
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:45,310
would make it worth it to leave

854
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:47,540
your family and friends for so long?

855
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:50,410
- Well, why'd you apply if
it wasn't what you wanted?

856
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:53,120
- My manager recommended
me for the very first time.

857
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,410
Huh, maybe he thought I was
the best man for the job

858
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:58,630
because I was spending a
lot of lonely weekends.

859
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:01,440
You know, putting in
extra hours at work, huh.

860
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,560
Well then I kinda had this
crazy dream, you know?

861
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,641
I kept thinking, wouldn't
it be great if I surprised

862
00:44:07,641 --> 00:44:11,100
everybody in the company, and volunteered?

863
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,100
Now that'd make my stock go
up with the office manager.

864
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,650
It was an adventure.

865
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,180
Of course given the choice between that

866
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,240
and the situation we're in
now, I think I would've chosen

867
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,940
to remain back on Earth and be
despised, what do you think?

868
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,490
- Well, I can understand what
you went through pretty well.

869
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,810
Every space sailor I
ever met had some kind of

870
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:29,980
bad experience in their past.

871
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,650
They try to wipe out every memory of it

872
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:33,093
during a 40 year stint.

873
00:44:34,402 --> 00:44:36,440
They usually don't manage it.

874
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,423
Yep, I've known an awful
lot of people like you.

875
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:41,223
There.

876
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:46,250
- I'm sorry, Hiro, I guess
I must've lost the key

877
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,460
to the cuffs when I blasted
that bugger, I apologize.

878
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,080
- It doesn't matter, I managed okay.

879
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,560
What's important is
that the bandage holds.

880
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,223
Thank you, Nancy. (sighing)

881
00:44:59,398 --> 00:45:02,815
(light, twinkling music)

882
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,340
- Do you mind, um--

883
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,570
- Go ahead.

884
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:09,950
- I can't believe, you
know, I just can't believe

885
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:13,130
what he was saying about you,
you couldn't murder anyone.

886
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:16,280
- Appearances can be very
misleading, but it's true,

887
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,710
I killed three people in broad daylight.

888
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:20,810
- What reason could you possibly have had?

889
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:28,150
- They made my sister into a drug addict.

890
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:29,300
- But, how?

891
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,840
- She was so beautiful, she
used to write me all the time.

892
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,750
She'd left home and enrolled
overseas in a big university.

893
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,580
Then she just disappeared.

894
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:41,820
I inquired everywhere, no
one had any information.

895
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,730
When I went to talk to her roommate,

896
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:45,750
she told me she didn't know anything.

897
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:49,380
So when I found her about
one year after that,

898
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,280
she wasn't anything like she had been.

899
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:56,320
I barely recognized her
when I saw her again.

900
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,310
And you know where that was, Nancy?

901
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:00,209
Prostituting for a King Street pimp.

902
00:46:00,209 --> 00:46:04,080
- (gasping) That's
terrible, is she all right?

903
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,095
- She's dead.

904
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,630
(gasping)

905
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,410
My brain just clicked off,
and I avenged the death

906
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:12,210
of my sister and the men responsible.

907
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:14,870
- It's true that drugs have
completely contaminated

908
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:17,700
the Earth and the moon, but
you had no right to kill them.

909
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,110
We were on their tracks for
months, and if we'd only

910
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,010
been able to arrest them, we
coulda split their drug ring,

911
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:25,250
closed down that prostitution operation,

912
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,700
and that'd have been the end of them.

913
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,400
You bollocks'd up everything
mate, and cost me my promotion.

914
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,960
- Damn their operation,
my job was to avenge

915
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,180
the death of my sister.

916
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:39,950
- I'll buy that mate, maybe
you can understand how I felt,

917
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:43,410
you cost me 2 1/2 years of
back-breaking investigative work

918
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:45,760
you know, and I'm not likely
to forgive you for that

919
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,680
in the foreseeable future.

920
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,490
- How were you able to
get on board as a member

921
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:52,610
of the expedition if you didn't
have an identification card?

922
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:55,150
- I have a close friend who
works for the Japanese branch

923
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:57,410
and he suggested I escape
with this expedition.

924
00:46:57,410 --> 00:47:00,750
His name's Hiro Takagi, he
was in love with my sister

925
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:02,333
and he had planned to marry her.

926
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:05,333
(adventurous music)

927
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:07,570
- What happened to Carolyn?

928
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:08,773
- We have to find her.

929
00:47:08,773 --> 00:47:11,773
(adventurous music)

930
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:23,622
(blasting)

931
00:47:27,685 --> 00:47:28,780
(tense music)

932
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:32,013
- Carolyn are you there? (gasping)

933
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:37,350
Oh my god, it's amazing.

934
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:40,350
(deep, tense music)

935
00:47:44,694 --> 00:47:48,356
(electronic squealing)

936
00:47:48,356 --> 00:47:50,523
(roaring)

937
00:47:54,769 --> 00:47:57,352
(Lily yelling)

938
00:48:00,225 --> 00:48:01,409
- Lily?

939
00:48:01,409 --> 00:48:03,992
(Lily yelling)

940
00:48:28,454 --> 00:48:29,367
(hissing)

941
00:48:29,367 --> 00:48:30,851
- Huh-huh!

942
00:48:30,851 --> 00:48:33,768
(deep piano music)

943
00:48:35,268 --> 00:48:37,519
What the hell is it?

944
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:39,108
(hissing)

945
00:48:39,108 --> 00:48:42,108
(adventurous music)

946
00:48:45,064 --> 00:48:47,577
(computer beeping)

947
00:48:47,577 --> 00:48:50,573
What's a diagram of the
bacterial invasion doing?

948
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:55,640
(screen beeping)

949
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,313
Lily cat?

950
00:49:36,436 --> 00:49:39,030
(footsteps clicking rapidly)

951
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:40,940
This block is completely infested,

952
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:42,710
get up to the main bridge now.

953
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:44,310
- Yeah, but Jimmy and
Carolyn, what happened?

954
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:47,370
- Forget it, I'm afraid
they're missing, or dead.

955
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:48,768
Come on, now.

956
00:49:48,768 --> 00:49:51,768
(adventurous music)

957
00:49:56,362 --> 00:49:58,184
(gasping)

958
00:49:58,184 --> 00:50:01,950
(adventurous music)

959
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:04,143
- It's metabolized even the bulkhead.

960
00:50:18,371 --> 00:50:21,704
(swishing and whirring)

961
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:47,610
(gasping)

962
00:50:48,723 --> 00:50:49,605
(yelling)

963
00:50:49,605 --> 00:50:52,605
(adventurous music)

964
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,388
(growling)

965
00:50:57,388 --> 00:51:00,563
(adventurous music)

966
00:51:00,563 --> 00:51:01,762
- Come!

967
00:51:01,762 --> 00:51:04,762
(adventurous music)

968
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:11,400
(yelling)

969
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:17,178
(Nancy yelling)

970
00:51:17,178 --> 00:51:20,178
(adventurous music)

971
00:51:30,443 --> 00:51:33,925
(man coughing)
(Nancy crying)

972
00:51:33,925 --> 00:51:35,610
- I can't put up with it anymore.

973
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:37,363
I can't, I'm gonna go crazy.

974
00:51:37,363 --> 00:51:39,780
- Does Syncam Corporation have a science

975
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,793
and technology development division?

976
00:51:41,793 --> 00:51:44,620
- Oh of course they do,
every company has it,

977
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:47,070
what's it have to do with what's
happening aboard this ship?

978
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:49,750
- Well, it could have something
to do with registration

979
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:52,480
number 2-3-7-0-3 Lily Cat.

980
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,820
- Huh?

981
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:57,030
- It's a robotic cat,
unbelievably advanced.

982
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:00,440
Perfect replica of the
cat you brought on board.

983
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,130
- A cat, what for?

984
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:03,780
- That robot's controlled the ship

985
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:06,026
ever since we left Earth's orbit.

986
00:52:06,026 --> 00:52:08,436
The engineers that maintain
this tub for Syncam

987
00:52:08,436 --> 00:52:11,260
obviously believe we're
obsolete and out of date.

988
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:14,360
They don't particularly think
humans can handle the job.

989
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,260
I suppose they feel we can't be trusted

990
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,540
because all we've got is
old-fashioned experience

991
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,960
and no scientific know
how, so they gave control

992
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,553
of the ship to that thing.

993
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:26,280
Machines don't need to eat or sleep.

994
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,846
They worked hard while
we lay on the couches.

995
00:52:28,846 --> 00:52:30,860
If they found anything
floating outside the ship,

996
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,970
they hauled it in according
to preset commands.

997
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:36,030
They probably even have a full data aspect

998
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:37,620
on the planet below us.

999
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,100
The machines are the most reliable

1000
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,540
and faithful employees the company's got.

1001
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,901
They're not gonna rely on a bunch of

1002
00:52:42,901 --> 00:52:45,151
incompetent humans like us.

1003
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:48,970
And Lily cat's too faithful
and reliable an employee

1004
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:52,003
to have let a bacteria onto
the ship to wipe out the crew.

1005
00:52:52,003 --> 00:52:54,781
- It's crazy. (cying)

1006
00:52:54,781 --> 00:52:59,781
(light piano music)
(screen beeping)

1007
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:13,569
(clanking)

1008
00:53:14,712 --> 00:53:19,712
(Dick gasping)
(dramatic music)

1009
00:53:32,349 --> 00:53:34,622
(screaming)

1010
00:53:34,622 --> 00:53:37,372
(dramatic music)

1011
00:53:44,777 --> 00:53:47,858
(crying out)

1012
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:50,941
(crying and yelling)

1013
00:53:56,207 --> 00:53:58,950
- (sighing) The reversal syndrome.

1014
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:00,290
- Reversal syndrome?

1015
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:02,540
- It's a function of
some very rare bacteria

1016
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:04,690
where they reverse the
mitosis of the nuclei

1017
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:06,780
and accelerate the growth
process of normally

1018
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:09,210
dormant cells in a short period of time.

1019
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:11,410
What's weird is the
absorption of the human tissue

1020
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:13,780
into the alien cell makeup.

1021
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:16,390
It's as though the bacteria
have used the human bodies

1022
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:19,240
to metamorphosis from a
caterpillar into a butterfly.

1023
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,680
- If what you're saying is what happened,

1024
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,610
that those monsters
and the recycled bodies

1025
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:24,970
of Dorothy, Carolyn, Morgan, and the rest,

1026
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,140
then what's to stop it from changing again

1027
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:28,360
into something even more horrible?

1028
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,498
- Yeah, but why metabolize
everything but our clothing?

1029
00:54:31,498 --> 00:54:34,581
(deep, solemn music)

1030
00:54:36,004 --> 00:54:41,004
Huh?
(clinking)

1031
00:54:41,043 --> 00:54:41,876
Hm.

1032
00:54:41,876 --> 00:54:46,170
- (gasping) I've never met anyone so mean.

1033
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:48,500
- Come to think of it, I'd
have done the same thing.

1034
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,280
He followed his principles
through, even though

1035
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,900
he already knew the
bacteria had infected him.

1036
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,010
He came on board this
ship with one objective,

1037
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:57,350
and that was to put handcuffs
on an escaping murderer.

1038
00:54:57,350 --> 00:54:59,017
And once he accomplished that objective,

1039
00:54:59,017 --> 00:55:01,563
he never even thought
about looking back again.

1040
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:10,337
I'll say one thing for him,
you have to respect him.

1041
00:55:12,593 --> 00:55:14,843
(crashing)

1042
00:55:16,217 --> 00:55:18,717
(gasping)

1043
00:55:18,717 --> 00:55:21,050
- The ship's reacting
to the infected blocks,

1044
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:23,060
and doing the same thing
it did with the hangar pod.

1045
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:25,040
It's protecting itself
by cutting them loose

1046
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,650
and blowing them up away from us.

1047
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:28,983
(exploding)

1048
00:55:40,895 --> 00:55:42,027
- Well, what if the computer decides

1049
00:55:42,027 --> 00:55:43,747
it's gonna dump this block?

1050
00:55:43,747 --> 00:55:45,980
- I'm not going to worry
just yet about that,

1051
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:48,130
this block isn't the same
as the cargo compartments

1052
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:49,340
that were jettisoned, even though

1053
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:51,147
the other ones are contaminated.

1054
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:53,773
- Let's not forget it's a machine, folks,

1055
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:57,130
desperately trying to save
itself even though it knows

1056
00:55:57,130 --> 00:56:00,303
it's going to be eaten by
the bacteria after all.

1057
00:56:06,207 --> 00:56:07,070
- What are you doing?

1058
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:09,830
- We have nowhere to run,
we can wait in this block

1059
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:11,500
but that means we'll die of starvation

1060
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,710
or become another monster
like the rest of them,

1061
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:16,610
which doesn't tickle my
fancy at this moment in time.

1062
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:20,150
So for me, the only answer
is for us to kill ourselves.

1063
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:22,960
Okay, how 'bout you, what's it gonna be?

1064
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,409
Chamber's got three shells
ready and waiting for us.

1065
00:56:25,409 --> 00:56:27,658
(gasping and crying)

1066
00:56:27,658 --> 00:56:29,767
- Oh, I can't believe it.

1067
00:56:29,767 --> 00:56:32,610
Why did I ever get on this stupid ship?

1068
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:36,080
I was only trying to have a little fun.

1069
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,944
I have this friend who's
so smart and really cute,

1070
00:56:38,944 --> 00:56:41,527
it's all her fault, I hate her,

1071
00:56:42,834 --> 00:56:45,390
and she stole my boyfriend.

1072
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:48,160
I wanted to get back at her, get revenge.

1073
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,860
I know exactly how she's gonna feel

1074
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:51,910
when I go back to Earth almost as young

1075
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:55,438
as when I left, and she's an ugly old bag.

1076
00:56:55,438 --> 00:56:58,749
I never thought it would end
like this, I never thought.

1077
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:03,749
(exploding)
(adventurous music)

1078
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:22,383
- At least I can see my sister again.

1079
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:24,870
- Wait, stop!

1080
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:27,670
- There's nothing more
to say about it, captain.

1081
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:29,620
- The bacteria won't eat everything.

1082
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:31,050
Even if we wind up dead,

1083
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:33,530
the ship will make it back in one piece.

1084
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:35,340
- What do you mean,
the bacteria'll destroy

1085
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:36,830
everything on the ship.

1086
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:38,450
- And I am positive it won't.

1087
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:40,790
On the motherboard I saw
a readout of the corrosion

1088
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:43,500
on board, and the cargo blocks
and storage compartments

1089
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,240
were almost completely devastated.

1090
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,910
But, bridge, sub-commands, and engine room

1091
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:49,683
were absolutely free of it.

1092
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:54,740
Residual magnetic fields are
built up by our impulse system.

1093
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:57,420
The impulse drive powers
the on-board electricity.

1094
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,786
That means an electromagnetic
field, and I guess

1095
00:57:59,786 --> 00:58:04,020
the bacteria must be, that's
it, the magnetic field

1096
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:05,850
kills them or repels them.

1097
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:07,760
- If the robot knows that
it could bring the ship

1098
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,590
back home, all it would
need are the bridge

1099
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:10,900
and the main drive system.

1100
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,660
- Of course it knows the situation.

1101
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,790
What possible reason
could it have to blow up

1102
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:16,280
the cargo blocks except to lighten

1103
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,853
the ship for the trip home?

1104
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:20,940
Do you understand what I'm talking about?

1105
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:23,490
I'm saying that even if all
13 members of the crew were to

1106
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:26,110
die somewhere out in deep
space, nobody gives a damn.

1107
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:28,330
The only thing the corporation
cares about is getting

1108
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:31,560
its precious data, without
paying us, if possible.

1109
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,910
- Does any of that really matter

1110
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:35,090
if there's nothing we can do about it?

1111
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:37,670
Our only choice is to die or be killed.

1112
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:38,503
- We're living.

1113
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:42,300
Remember what Detective Berry said.

1114
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:46,130
We may die any minute, but
right now, dammit we are alive.

1115
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:48,620
Listen to me, every moment you're alive,

1116
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:50,457
you have a duty to
survive any way you can.

1117
00:58:50,457 --> 00:58:53,280
- But we can't, it's impossible.

1118
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,090
- You've got a big, brand
new planet right below you.

1119
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:58,280
With any luck, you could
survive there forever.

1120
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:01,785
- That's ridiculous, we haven't
got any more probe ships.

1121
00:59:01,785 --> 00:59:05,930
- Wrong. (laughing)

1122
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:08,230
I still have my lucky charm, kid.

1123
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:09,323
Come on, follow me.

1124
00:59:10,668 --> 00:59:13,251
(somber music)

1125
00:59:19,248 --> 00:59:22,831
(rapid, adventurous music)

1126
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,750
- You brought a shuttle.

1127
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:30,010
- I had it my first
trip, and ever since then

1128
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:31,460
I've brought this little baby with me

1129
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:33,100
every mission I ever made.

1130
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,930
Walt, he laughed at me all
the time, but I just couldn't

1131
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:38,150
trash it, our memories are powerful

1132
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:41,330
and that little machine recalls
every experience I ever had.

1133
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:44,330
(adventurous music)

1134
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,580
- You can't, what are you doing?

1135
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:51,040
- It's a pity I couldn't have been

1136
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,003
a little better skipper after all.

1137
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,130
- Captain, it's--

1138
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:01,673
- Be alive, do everything
you can to be alive.

1139
01:00:02,914 --> 01:00:05,914
(adventurous music)

1140
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:11,673
Registration number, 2-3-7-0-3 Lily cat.

1141
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:14,740
They're not going to bring
this plagued ship back

1142
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:17,032
except over my dead body.

1143
01:00:17,032 --> 01:00:20,532

1144

1145
01:00:51,146 --> 01:00:54,229

1146
01:01:00,499 --> 01:01:03,416

1147
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:11,110

1148
01:01:15,439 --> 01:01:17,689

1149
01:01:19,057 --> 01:01:21,974

1150

01:02:01,203 --> 01:02:02,531

1152
01:02:02,531 --> 01:02:04,864

01:02:16,823 --> 01:02:18,990

1154

(grunting)

1155
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:33,587
And, well, it appears it's going to be

1156
01:02:33,587 --> 01:02:35,594
a little quicker than we thought.

1157
01:02:35,594 --> 01:02:37,927
(whooshing)

1158

(loud howling)

1162
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,467
- I'm so sad about this.

1163
01:03:49,467 --> 01:03:51,410
All of us should've been able to land

1164
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:53,067
on the planet, you know.

1165
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:57,430
Is anything wrong, what're
you thinking about Hiro?

1166
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:59,960
- I was wondering about
butterflies and if they

1167
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:02,250
ever regretted that, if
they ever even thought of

1168
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:03,883
their past as caterpillars.

1169
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:08,480
And, if the caterpillar
ever thinks of its future

1170
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,830
up there as that exquisite
creature in the air.

1171
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:13,990
We'll be metamorphosing somewhere

1172
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:16,200
onto another level some day.

1173
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,228
Some other kind or frequency of existence

1174
01:04:18,228 --> 01:04:19,963
if that's our promised end.

1175
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:25,750
We'll have to live out
whatever our destiny is.

1176
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:27,780
And nobody can know
what the future'll bring

1177
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,897
in this world or even the next one.
