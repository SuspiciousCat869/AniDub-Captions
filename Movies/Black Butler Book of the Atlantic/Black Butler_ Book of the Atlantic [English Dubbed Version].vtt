[FINNIAN]
Crikey!

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:56.121 position:16% line:89% align:start
So this is the Campania?

00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:57.790 position:33% line:89% align:start
She's 'uge!

00:00:57.823 --> 00:00:59.259 position:27% line:89% align:start
An' lovely, too!

First-class suite A 66, please.

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:06.265 position:5% line:89% align:start
The so-called "ship of dreams."

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.503 position:7% line:83% align:start
[CIEL] The Majestic Star Line
staked its entire future

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:13.239 position:19% line:83% align:start
on this transatlantic
luxury liner.

00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:15.474 position:16% line:89% align:start
They have much to lose.

00:01:15.507 --> 00:01:18.077 position:7% line:83% align:start
Just looking at 'er is enough
to take me breath away.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.078 position:30% line:89% align:start
Blimey, Snake!

00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:20.546 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yer so lucky you get to go!

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.982 position:21% line:83% align:start
You best look after
the master for us, now.

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:25.851 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've always dreamed o'
goin' on a sea voyage!

00:01:25.884 --> 00:01:27.019 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's enough gawking.

00:01:27.052 --> 00:01:28.354 position:27% line:83% align:start
I trust you will
see to your duties

00:01:28.387 --> 00:01:30.155 position:16% line:83% align:start
and keep out of trouble
while we're away.

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:31.090 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes, sir!

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:32.324 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TANAKA]
Ho ho ho!

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:37.895 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now, then. Let's be off.

00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:40.065 position:19% line:89% align:start
See you soon, my lord!

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:41.866 position:13% line:89% align:start
Have a safe journey, sir!

00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:43.269 position:35% line:83% align:start

[CROWD MAN B]
Safe travels!

[CROWD yelling]

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:59.518 position:35% line:83% align:start
[BALDROY]
Don't go gettin' seasick, now!

00:02:11.963 --> 00:02:14.832 position:13% line:83% align:start
[RONALD] Whew! That was a
bit of a close shave, there.

00:02:14.866 --> 00:02:18.069 position:7% line:83% align:start
I made it on in time, though,
and that's all that matters.

00:02:18.102 --> 00:02:20.171 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's smooth sailin' now,
and the future

00:02:20.204 --> 00:02:21.539 position:24% line:89% align:start
is lookin bright.

00:02:21.572 --> 00:02:23.474 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well, for some of us, anyhow.

00:02:38.922 --> 00:02:41.159 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's it, then.
We've left dry land behind.

00:02:41.192 --> 00:02:42.160 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yes, we have.

00:02:42.193 --> 00:02:45.396 position:19% line:83% align:start
For now, dry land and
England are behind us,

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.131 position:5% line:83% align:start
and I suppose only the Atlantic
knows what lies ahead.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.606 position:13% line:83% align:start
[CIEL] Are you telling me
that this hospital purports

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.240 position:5% line:89% align:start
to bring the dead back to life?

00:02:57.274 --> 00:02:58.376 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yes, exactly.

00:03:00.077 --> 00:03:01.278 position:24% line:89% align:start
Even if it's true,

00:03:01.311 --> 00:03:03.013 position:24% line:83% align:start
I have no interest
in the occult.

00:03:03.046 --> 00:03:04.649 position:16% line:83% align:start
And if it were something
else entirely?

00:03:04.682 --> 00:03:05.415 position:35% line:89% align:start
Like what?

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:08.185 position:27% line:83% align:start
I may have heard
a rumor or two.

00:03:08.218 --> 00:03:11.088 position:10% line:83% align:start
It seems Karnstein Hospital
does an awful lot of business

00:03:11.121 --> 00:03:14.524 position:27% line:83% align:start
at the docks you
have me... supervising.

00:03:14.558 --> 00:03:15.592 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CIEL]
Drugs?

00:03:16.626 --> 00:03:18.995 position:33% line:89% align:start
No. People.

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:21.098 position:16% line:83% align:start
They've made use of the
human trafficking trade

00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:23.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
to smuggle large
numbers from overseas.

00:03:26.436 --> 00:03:27.404 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SEBASTIAN]
So, then...

00:03:27.437 --> 00:03:29.406 position:16% line:83% align:start
They're raising the dead
not via occult means,

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:31.941 position:21% line:83% align:start
but through illicit
human experimentation.

00:03:31.975 --> 00:03:33.276 position:41% line:83% align:start
[LAU]
Yes, I believe so.

00:03:34.444 --> 00:03:37.481 position:10% line:83% align:start
Hmm. That sort of accusation
certainly warrants

00:03:37.514 --> 00:03:38.914 position:30% line:89% align:start
a closer look.

00:03:38.948 --> 00:03:41.184 position:16% line:83% align:start
If it is true, we'd best
resolve the situation

00:03:41.218 --> 00:03:43.085 position:19% line:89% align:start
as quickly as we can.

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:45.222 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sebastian, investigate at once.

00:03:45.255 --> 00:03:47.056 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yes. It would be my pleasure.

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:55.599 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SEBASTIAN]
I have done as you asked.

00:03:55.632 --> 00:03:58.000 position:16% line:89% align:start
As quick as ever, I see.

00:03:58.033 --> 00:04:00.136 position:24% line:83% align:start
What in the world
are you wearing?!

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:01.538 position:5% line:89% align:start
You know what they say, my lord:

00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:03.640 position:30% line:83% align:start
"When in Rome,
do as the Romans do."

00:04:03.673 --> 00:04:07.276 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now, then, I've learned
something rather interesting.

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:08.678 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yes, let's hear it.

00:04:08.712 --> 00:04:10.714 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SEBASTIAN]
According to a certain nurse,

00:04:10.747 --> 00:04:13.182 position:19% line:83% align:start
the hospital sponsors
a secret club of sorts

00:04:13.215 --> 00:04:15.518 position:10% line:89% align:start
known as the Aurora Society.

00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:18.454 position:16% line:83% align:start
Their goal is to achieve
"mankind's perfect salvation

00:04:18.487 --> 00:04:20.222 position:5% line:89% align:start
through medicine." To that end,

00:04:20.256 --> 00:04:22.158 position:21% line:83% align:start
they perform illegal
human experiments

00:04:22.191 --> 00:04:24.193 position:21% line:89% align:start
funded by nobility.

00:04:24.226 --> 00:04:26.162 position:30% line:83% align:start
Unfortunately,
I found no evidence

00:04:26.195 --> 00:04:28.631 position:21% line:83% align:start
of their activities
within the hospital itself.

00:04:28.664 --> 00:04:30.332 position:5% line:89% align:start
In which case, our best hope is

00:04:30.366 --> 00:04:33.235 position:27% line:83% align:start
to infiltrate an
Aurora Society gathering.

00:04:33.269 --> 00:04:34.503 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SEBASTIAN]
As it so happens,

00:04:34.537 --> 00:04:37.706 position:7% line:83% align:start
I was able to uncover the time
and place of the next meeting.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.209 position:27% line:83% align:start
A passenger ship
departing from Southampton

00:04:40.242 --> 00:04:41.744 position:19% line:89% align:start
on the 17th of April.

00:04:41.777 --> 00:04:44.447 position:33% line:83% align:start
[CIEL] Hmph.
A gathering onboard a ship?

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.248 position:10% line:89% align:start
How very like the nobility.

00:04:47.282 --> 00:04:49.452 position:7% line:89% align:start
Did you say the 17th of April?

00:04:49.485 --> 00:04:50.386 position:33% line:89% align:start
[CIEL gasps]

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.188 position:21% line:83% align:start
Our family is going
on holiday in April!

00:04:53.221 --> 00:04:55.023 position:5% line:89% align:start
A three-week voyage to New York.

00:04:55.056 --> 00:04:56.559 position:27% line:83% align:start
We're traveling
on a luxury liner,

00:04:56.592 --> 00:04:58.159 position:7% line:89% align:start
and Father's invited you too!

00:04:58.193 --> 00:05:00.028 position:19% line:89% align:start
Isn't that wonderful?

00:05:00.061 --> 00:05:01.229 position:7% line:89% align:start
What's the name of the vessel?

00:05:01.262 --> 00:05:05.099 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's a new luxury liner built
by the Majestic Star Line.

00:05:05.133 --> 00:05:06.434 position:30% line:89% align:start
The Campania.

You're here!

00:05:31.593 --> 00:05:32.527 position:13% line:89% align:start
When I first invited you,

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.762 position:19% line:83% align:start
you said you wouldn't
be able to get away.

00:05:34.796 --> 00:05:35.763 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:05:35.797 --> 00:05:37.665 position:19% line:83% align:start
Forgive me, but I was
hoping to surprise you.

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
You took time off
just to be with me?

00:05:40.133 --> 00:05:41.769 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's so adorable!

00:05:41.803 --> 00:05:42.804 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's quite enough.

00:05:42.837 --> 00:05:45.507 position:10% line:83% align:start
We're in public, Elizabeth.
Show some decorum.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.775 position:16% line:83% align:start
Mother is right, Lizzie.
You're making a spectacle.

00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:48.810 position:30% line:89% align:start

Betrothed or not,

00:05:50.344 --> 00:05:53.080 position:13% line:83% align:start
I refuse to recognize you
as my future brother.

Now you will unhand her at once!

00:05:56.183 --> 00:05:58.218 position:16% line:83% align:start

are you, brother dear?

00:06:01.121 --> 00:06:04.124 position:16% line:83% align:start

what a pleasure.

It's been too long, truly.

I'm so terribly glad you came!

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:10.063 position:13% line:89% align:start

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:20.807 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CIEL]
Yes.

00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:22.776 position:10% line:83% align:start
[ELIZABETH] We've never had
that much time together!

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:25.579 position:10% line:83% align:start
Do say you'll escort me to a
dinner party while we're here.

00:06:25.612 --> 00:06:28.080 position:21% line:83% align:start
Certainly, if that's
what you wish.

[EDWARD growls]

00:06:30.384 --> 00:06:33.119 position:10% line:89% align:start
Not over-fond of me, is he?

00:06:33.152 --> 00:06:35.121 position:24% line:83% align:start
You have time yet
to win him over.

00:06:35.154 --> 00:06:37.290 position:24% line:83% align:start
The gathering will
take place on the 19th.

00:06:37.324 --> 00:06:39.359 position:13% line:89% align:start
Perhaps you should relax.

00:06:39.393 --> 00:06:41.695 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SEBASTIAN] Enjoying a holiday
isn't likely to kill you.

00:06:43.497 --> 00:06:45.197 position:24% line:83% align:start
We'll have to find
the perfect dress!

What are you doing here?

00:07:00.613 --> 00:07:02.715 position:21% line:83% align:start
I might ask you the
same thing, old chap.

00:07:02.748 --> 00:07:04.717 position:24% line:83% align:start
We were invited to

It's difficult to explain.

00:59:48.692 --> 00:59:51.326 position:24% line:83% align:start
At first I suppose
I was just curious

00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:53.529 position:27% line:83% align:start
about people and
their mortality.

01:00:07.743 --> 01:00:10.013 position:24% line:83% align:start
When a person has
both a soul and a body

01:00:10.046 --> 01:00:12.614 position:5% line:89% align:start
of flesh and bone, she is alive.

01:00:12.648 --> 01:00:13.882 position:13% line:89% align:start
She travels through life,

01:00:13.916 --> 01:00:16.852 position:10% line:83% align:start
growing from child to adult,
and as she does,

01:00:16.885 --> 01:00:18.587 position:21% line:83% align:start
all of her memories
are inscribed

01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:20.656 position:16% line:89% align:start
in her Cinematic Record.

01:00:20.689 --> 01:00:23.492 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then, when her body
at last perishes,

01:00:23.525 --> 01:00:25.894 position:27% line:83% align:start
a Reaper appears
to collect her soul.

01:00:25.928 --> 01:00:30.364 position:7% line:83% align:start
That is where the Record ends,
and the quick becomes the dead.

That is the task of the
Grim Reapers, you see.

in which they were housed,

01:00:36.505 --> 01:00:39.507 position:16% line:83% align:start
thus ending each Record
at the appointed time.

01:00:50.318 --> 01:00:52.921 position:30% line:83% align:start
Until one day,
a thought occurred to me.

What if there were

01:05:02.933 --> 01:05:05.702 position:7% line:89% align:start
but now really isn't the time.

01:05:05.736 --> 01:05:06.870 position:35% line:89% align:start
Very well.

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:08.238 position:7% line:89% align:start
If it's a battle you're after,

01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:10.607 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll give it to you
without restraint.

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.175 position:19% line:83% align:start
The fact that you know
the word "restraint"

01:05:12.209 --> 01:05:15.645 position:5% line:83% align:start
is by far the greatest surprise
of this very surprising day.

01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:19.783 position:7% line:83% align:start
[RONALD] Essentially, whoever
gets to him first is the victor.

01:05:19.816 --> 01:05:23.086 position:7% line:83% align:start
Not to be immodest, but I like
my chances in this game.

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:24.254 position:33% line:83% align:start
[UNDERTAKER]
Hee-hee-hee-hee!

01:05:24.287 --> 01:05:27.124 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's like a pack
of dogs after a fox.

01:05:27.157 --> 01:05:28.925 position:33% line:89% align:start
Fascinating.

01:05:28.959 --> 01:05:31.995 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can't wait to see who
will sink their teeth in first.

[RONALD] My mistake!
Thought you were him.

01:06:09.832 --> 01:06:12.168 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then perhaps you should
have your eyes examined.

[RONALD gasps]

01:06:13.335 --> 01:06:16.105 position:16% line:83% align:start
Reapers are all terribly
nearsighted, didn't you know?

01:06:16.138 --> 01:06:18.274 position:19% line:83% align:start
[GRELL] Which puts you
at a disadvantage!

01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:19.842 position:30% line:89% align:start
[GRELL gasps]

01:06:20.743 --> 01:06:23.345 position:38% line:83% align:start
[GRELL]
I sliced it. Then was that...?

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.314 position:30% line:89% align:start

[RONALD]
My spectacles!

01:06:33.089 --> 01:06:34.889 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you're still
relying on your eyes,

01:06:34.923 --> 01:06:36.292 position:13% line:89% align:start
you have a long way to go.

01:06:37.226 --> 01:06:39.095 position:19% line:83% align:start
[UNDERTAKER] How much
damage can you hope to inflict

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:40.628 position:13% line:89% align:start
with those tiny utensils?

01:06:40.662 --> 01:06:42.064 position:27% line:83% align:start
What our silver
may lack in size,

01:06:42.098 --> 01:06:43.865 position:7% line:89% align:start
it makes up for in sharpness.

01:06:45.301 --> 01:06:46.701 position:35% line:89% align:start
So I see.

01:06:48.903 --> 01:06:51.005 position:5% line:89% align:start
A rather pitiful showing, lads.

01:06:51.039 --> 01:06:54.142 position:19% line:83% align:start
Three dogs, and nobody
managed to catch the fox.

01:06:54.175 --> 01:06:56.744 position:19% line:83% align:start
And here I thought you
were going to bag me.

[giggling]

01:06:58.146 --> 01:07:00.115 position:21% line:83% align:start

exceptionally irritating.

01:07:00.148 --> 01:07:01.249 position:38% line:83% align:start
[GRELL]
Let's get on with this.

01:07:01.282 --> 01:07:03.318 position:7% line:89% align:start
The ship is tilting like mad.

01:07:03.351 --> 01:07:05.286 position:24% line:83% align:start
We don't have time
to make it pretty!

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.354 position:19% line:89% align:start
Right! No more games!

01:07:06.387 --> 01:07:08.289 position:19% line:89% align:start
Time to bag us a fox!

01:07:10.225 --> 01:07:12.260 position:38% line:83% align:start
[GRELL]
Again? Impossible!

01:07:12.293 --> 01:07:14.762 position:19% line:83% align:start
Death Scythes are the
sharpest blades in the world!

01:07:14.796 --> 01:07:16.030 position:5% line:89% align:start
There's nothing they can't cut!

01:07:16.064 --> 01:07:18.299 position:5% line:89% align:start
So how do you keep blocking us?

01:07:18.333 --> 01:07:20.268 position:16% line:83% align:start
They say a Death Scythe
is sharp enough

01:07:20.301 --> 01:07:22.370 position:27% line:89% align:start
to cut anything.

01:07:22.403 --> 01:07:24.038 position:21% line:83% align:start
However, we Reapers
know that claim

01:07:24.072 --> 01:07:26.074 position:30% line:83% align:start
isn't entirely
accurate, don't we?

01:07:26.107 --> 01:07:27.142 position:21% line:89% align:start
[RONALD, GRELL gasp]

01:07:27.175 --> 01:07:29.710 position:19% line:83% align:start
[UNDERTAKER] There is
something they can't cut.

01:07:29.743 --> 01:07:31.379 position:27% line:89% align:start
Just one thing.

01:07:31.412 --> 01:07:32.046 position:44% line:89% align:start
No!

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:33.148 position:33% line:89% align:start
Impossible!

[SEBASTIAN, CIEL gasp]

01:07:48.396 --> 01:07:49.730 position:33% line:89% align:start
Impossible!

01:07:54.134 --> 01:07:55.836 position:38% line:83% align:start
[GRELL]
It's a Death Scythe!

01:07:57.271 --> 01:07:58.238 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yes, of course.

01:07:58.272 --> 01:08:01.241 position:19% line:83% align:start
Multiple Death Scythes
exist, and therefore,

01:08:01.275 --> 01:08:04.244 position:13% line:83% align:start
the claim that one can cut
anything must be false.

01:08:05.913 --> 01:08:07.781 position:21% line:83% align:start
I thought a Reaper's
scythe was confiscated

01:08:07.814 --> 01:08:09.016 position:27% line:89% align:start
upon retirement.

01:08:09.049 --> 01:08:11.952 position:10% line:83% align:start
We'd been together so long,
I couldn't bear to part with it.

01:08:11.985 --> 01:08:13.287 position:27% line:89% align:start
You understand.

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:16.423 position:13% line:83% align:start
Though I admit, smuggling
it out wasn't easy.

01:08:16.456 --> 01:08:19.326 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, now, it would appear that
the tables have been turned,

01:08:19.359 --> 01:08:21.761 position:21% line:83% align:start
and the hunters have
become the hunted.

01:08:21.794 --> 01:08:23.230 position:10% line:89% align:start
Are you ready, little foxes?

01:08:23.263 --> 01:08:24.864 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm after you now.

Heh.

01:08:52.325 --> 01:08:53.826 position:33% line:83% align:start
[UNDERTAKER]
Wasted effort.

01:08:53.859 --> 01:08:55.995 position:13% line:83% align:start
Truly. I can slice through
a table as easily

01:08:56.028 --> 01:08:57.430 position:19% line:89% align:start
as snapping a biscuit.

01:08:58.364 --> 01:08:59.899 position:24% line:83% align:start
But they kept you
occupied long enough

01:08:59.932 --> 01:09:01.901 position:5% line:89% align:start
for me to get inside your reach.

01:09:02.468 --> 01:09:05.338 position:27% line:83% align:start
I see you have a
fair hand for strategy.

01:09:05.371 --> 01:09:06.405 position:35% line:89% align:start
Luckily...

you for one of my coffins

01:09:14.847 --> 01:09:16.781 position:13% line:89% align:start

[UNDERTAKER] Human lives
may be fragile things,

01:09:46.579 --> 01:09:49.014 position:19% line:83% align:start
but dragging one along
with you is a lot of work,

01:09:49.047 --> 01:09:50.315 position:24% line:89% align:start
isn't it, butler?

01:09:50.348 --> 01:09:51.517 position:33% line:89% align:start
Quite a lot.

01:09:52.384 --> 01:09:55.487 position:27% line:83% align:start
I've always been
curious about you.

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:57.255 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why would vermin
such as yourself

01:09:57.289 --> 01:10:00.892 position:19% line:83% align:start
wish to don a uniform
and play at being a servant?

01:10:00.925 --> 01:10:04.396 position:10% line:83% align:start
Perhaps watching your Record
will give me the answer.

[SEBASTIAN gasping]

01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:07.132 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sebastian!

01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:14.939 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SEBASTIAN]
Ah, he is calling.

01:10:14.973 --> 01:10:20.278 position:21% line:83% align:start
In sorrow, in anger,
in despair, in terror.

01:10:20.312 --> 01:10:23.248 position:21% line:83% align:start
He spits out curses,
and they fall like flames

01:10:23.281 --> 01:10:25.049 position:27% line:89% align:start
from his tongue.

01:10:25.083 --> 01:10:26.984 position:21% line:89% align:start
Summoning me to him.

01:10:29.387 --> 01:10:32.457 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tell me, boy, what is your name?

01:10:32.490 --> 01:10:34.392 position:27% line:83% align:start
You wish to know
what my name is?

01:10:35.959 --> 01:10:37.395 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's Ciel.

01:10:37.429 --> 01:10:40.432 position:10% line:89% align:start
My name is Ciel Phantomhive.

01:10:40.465 --> 01:10:44.301 position:21% line:83% align:start
I am the heir to the
Phantomhive earldom.

01:10:44.335 --> 01:10:46.403 position:33% line:89% align:start
I see. Good.

01:10:46.437 --> 01:10:48.573 position:7% line:89% align:start
In that case, before we begin,

01:10:48.606 --> 01:10:51.442 position:16% line:83% align:start
I shall have to assume a
form befitting the servant

01:10:51.475 --> 01:10:52.910 position:33% line:89% align:start
of an earl.

01:10:56.914 --> 01:11:00.484 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SEBASTIAN]
Now, give me my first order.

01:11:01.919 --> 01:11:04.321 position:7% line:89% align:start
I am at your service, my lord.

01:11:07.458 --> 01:11:10.094 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SEBASTIAN] There were three
things that he wished of me.

01:11:11.061 --> 01:11:12.996 position:24% line:83% align:start
To protect him and
never betray him

01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:15.399 position:27% line:83% align:start
until he carried
out his revenge.

01:11:15.432 --> 01:11:18.635 position:21% line:83% align:start
To follow his orders
with absolute obedience,

01:11:18.669 --> 01:11:21.372 position:27% line:83% align:start
and to be honest
with him at all times.

01:11:22.439 --> 01:11:24.941 position:19% line:83% align:start
I suspected the tasks
would prove difficult

01:11:24.974 --> 01:11:28.212 position:10% line:83% align:start
while smartly performing the
duties of an earl's butler.

01:11:28.245 --> 01:11:30.146 position:19% line:83% align:start
Someone is attempting
to exterminate

01:11:30.179 --> 01:11:33.182 position:7% line:89% align:start
the entire Phantomhive family.

01:11:33.216 --> 01:11:35.652 position:24% line:83% align:start
The previous earl
lost his battle,

01:11:35.686 --> 01:11:38.087 position:19% line:89% align:start
but when they return,

01:11:38.121 --> 01:11:40.356 position:24% line:83% align:start
then I mean to be
ready for them.

01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:42.425 position:19% line:89% align:start
I am Ciel Phantomhive.

01:11:42.459 --> 01:11:45.128 position:27% line:83% align:start
The head of the
Phantomhive family.

01:11:45.161 --> 01:11:46.563 position:27% line:89% align:start
I will not lose.

01:11:47.530 --> 01:11:48.699 position:21% line:89% align:start
[SEBASTIAN chuckles]

01:11:48.732 --> 01:11:49.932 position:13% line:89% align:start
You find something funny?

01:11:49.966 --> 01:11:54.003 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, it is interesting that
you instructed me not to lie,

01:11:54.036 --> 01:11:56.339 position:27% line:83% align:start
when you are so
clearly a liar yourself.

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.109 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SEBASTIAN]
He is a troublesome thing.

01:12:00.143 --> 01:12:03.379 position:16% line:83% align:start
Still, even if it takes
an entire human lifetime

01:12:03.413 --> 01:12:04.947 position:16% line:89% align:start
to fulfill our contract,

01:12:04.981 --> 01:12:08.584 position:16% line:83% align:start
it will feel like merely
the blink of an eye to me.

01:12:08.618 --> 01:12:11.988 position:16% line:83% align:start
As long as it passes the
time and fills my stomach,

01:12:12.021 --> 01:12:13.989 position:16% line:89% align:start
I require nothing more.

01:12:14.023 --> 01:12:15.558 position:5% line:89% align:start
If we are finished here, Master,

01:12:15.591 --> 01:12:17.593 position:24% line:83% align:start
perhaps we should
return to your manor.

01:12:18.728 --> 01:12:20.329 position:41% line:83% align:start

Uhh...?

01:12:22.063 --> 01:12:24.667 position:10% line:83% align:start
I have a relative at London
Hospital who will know.

01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:26.602 position:5% line:89% align:start
We shall go and speak with her.

Very good, my lord.

He can't find his own home?

What a poor, pathetic little

[CIEL]
Wait.

01:12:36.746 --> 01:12:38.346 position:13% line:89% align:start
What is your name, demon?

01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:41.149 position:21% line:83% align:start
My name is whatever
you would like for it to be.

01:12:41.183 --> 01:12:42.184 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right.

01:12:44.687 --> 01:12:47.122 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sebastian.

01:12:47.155 --> 01:12:49.725 position:19% line:83% align:start
From now on, you shall
answer to "Sebastian."

01:12:49.759 --> 01:12:51.493 position:16% line:89% align:start
Most excellent, my lord.

01:12:51.526 --> 01:12:54.296 position:19% line:83% align:start
May I be so bold as to
inquire after your inspiration

01:12:54.329 --> 01:12:55.564 position:30% line:89% align:start
for the name?

01:12:55.597 --> 01:12:58.099 position:24% line:83% align:start
Was that what your
last butler was called?

01:12:58.133 --> 01:13:01.036 position:13% line:89% align:start
No, it was my dog's name.

01:13:01.069 --> 01:13:02.270 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SEBASTIAN]
On second thought,

01:13:02.304 --> 01:13:06.041 position:10% line:83% align:start
what a spoiled, nasty little
brat I've saddled myself with.

01:13:12.547 --> 01:13:13.682 position:33% line:89% align:start
This is it?

01:13:13.715 --> 01:13:16.083 position:21% line:89% align:start
It is badly damaged.

01:13:16.116 --> 01:13:17.152 position:38% line:89% align:start

I miss you.

01:13:34.703 --> 01:13:36.671 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SEBASTIAN] It was both
the first and the last time

01:13:36.705 --> 01:13:39.206 position:27% line:83% align:start
I heard him call
his parents that.

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:42.109 position:13% line:83% align:start
Like he was burying those
words alongside them.

01:13:44.178 --> 01:13:46.647 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SEBASTIAN] My lord.
The sun is setting soon.

01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:49.350 position:13% line:83% align:start
You wouldn't want to catch
a chill from the night air.

01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:50.317 position:35% line:89% align:start
Very well.

01:13:50.351 --> 01:13:52.119 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's a pub nearby
with decent lodgings.

01:13:52.152 --> 01:13:53.354 position:5% line:89% align:start
We'll stay there for the night.

01:13:53.387 --> 01:13:54.288 position:38% line:89% align:start
No need.

01:13:54.321 --> 01:13:56.290 position:13% line:83% align:start
We have our own lodgings,
I do believe.

01:14:00.194 --> 01:14:01.262 position:24% line:89% align:start
It can't be true!

You haven't forgotten already?

01:14:02.796 --> 01:14:04.698 position:5% line:89% align:start
I promised I'd never lie to you.

01:14:07.701 --> 01:14:08.802 position:38% line:89% align:start
But how?

01:14:08.836 --> 01:14:10.404 position:21% line:89% align:start
This is impossible!

01:14:10.437 --> 01:14:12.740 position:13% line:83% align:start
An earl's butler who can't
rebuild a crumbling manor

01:14:12.773 --> 01:14:15.409 position:19% line:83% align:start
in this amount of time
isn't worth his salt, my lord.

[SEBASTIAN]
Come.

I hope it is acceptable.

You scalded me!

I do apologize.

01:14:38.264 --> 01:14:40.099 position:27% line:83% align:start
I shall be more
careful next time.

01:14:40.133 --> 01:14:41.167 position:10% line:89% align:start
Now, if you will pardon me,

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:42.736 position:27% line:83% align:start
this may take a
bit of scrubbing.

Do please try to hold still.

Struggling will only prolong
the process, I assure you.

The tiniest germ entering
the tiniest scrape

01:16:00.345 --> 01:16:01.613 position:10% line:89% align:start
That would be most wearying.

Are you or are
you not my butler?

Do as I say.

Forgive my
impertinence, my lord.

Very sorry.
Is the dish not to your liking?

It's oily and spicy

Of course!

that this menu

Your appetite may
not have returned,

I don't want it.

taste terrible.

01:16:43.754 --> 01:16:45.356 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SEBASTIAN]
I've only heated the milk.

01:16:45.389 --> 01:16:46.992 position:24% line:83% align:start
I didn't flavor it
with anything.

01:16:47.025 --> 01:16:50.861 position:10% line:83% align:start
As to whether it tastes good
or not, I couldn't say.

01:16:50.895 --> 01:16:52.463 position:16% line:89% align:start
Perhaps you can tell me.

01:16:54.365 --> 01:16:55.900 position:21% line:89% align:start
Is there any honey?

01:16:55.933 --> 01:16:57.935 position:35% line:83% align:start
Certainly.
As much as you'd like.

01:16:57.968 --> 01:17:00.271 position:16% line:83% align:start
[CIEL] Tanaka scolded me
for eating honey at night.

01:17:00.304 --> 01:17:01.806 position:5% line:89% align:start
He said it would decay my teeth.

01:17:02.973 --> 01:17:04.675 position:19% line:83% align:start
Then I shall scold you
for it as well,

01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:06.209 position:16% line:89% align:start
but not until tomorrow.

01:17:19.757 --> 01:17:22.660 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CIEL]
Sebastian. The hot milk.

01:17:22.693 --> 01:17:24.895 position:27% line:89% align:start
It tasted good.

01:17:24.929 --> 01:17:26.964 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm happy it was
to your liking.

01:17:26.997 --> 01:17:28.631 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CIEL]
However...

01:17:28.665 --> 01:17:30.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
I shall be displeased
if breakfast is as ghastly

01:17:30.835 --> 01:17:32.837 position:24% line:83% align:start
as what you served
me this evening.

01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:35.039 position:7% line:83% align:start
If you can't learn to do more
than heat a kettle of milk,

01:17:35.072 --> 01:17:37.273 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm going to starve before long.

01:17:39.409 --> 01:17:41.946 position:16% line:83% align:start
[CIEL] Today's breakfast
was atrocious as well.

01:17:41.979 --> 01:17:43.680 position:19% line:89% align:start
I apologize, my lord.

01:17:43.713 --> 01:17:45.515 position:24% line:83% align:start
My sense of taste
differs from a human's,

01:17:45.548 --> 01:17:46.850 position:16% line:89% align:start
so I have much to learn.

01:17:46.883 --> 01:17:48.052 position:10% line:89% align:start
You'd better learn quickly.

01:17:48.085 --> 01:17:49.919 position:21% line:83% align:start
We have other things
to focus on.

01:17:49.953 --> 01:17:53.289 position:10% line:83% align:start
There are too many things I
don't know about my own house.

01:17:53.323 --> 01:17:54.991 position:16% line:89% align:start
Indeed, that is a start.

01:17:55.024 --> 01:17:56.526 position:10% line:89% align:start
However, as the family head,

01:17:56.559 --> 01:17:58.027 position:19% line:83% align:start
you will also need to
acquire the knowledge

01:17:58.061 --> 01:17:59.796 position:13% line:89% align:start
and education of an adult.

01:17:59.829 --> 01:18:01.965 position:16% line:83% align:start
I am happy to design an
appropriate curriculum

01:18:01.998 --> 01:18:03.633 position:7% line:89% align:start
and serve as your instructor.

01:18:03.666 --> 01:18:05.502 position:35% line:89% align:start
You? Why?

01:18:05.535 --> 01:18:07.804 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've picked up a bit of
knowledge here and there.

01:18:07.837 --> 01:18:09.939 position:10% line:89% align:start
Will Spartan education suit?

01:18:09.973 --> 01:18:11.541 position:21% line:89% align:start
It will have to do.

01:18:11.574 --> 01:18:13.408 position:24% line:83% align:start
We don't have the
luxury of time.

01:18:13.442 --> 01:18:16.079 position:24% line:83% align:start
I am a child earl,
and you are fake butler.

01:18:16.112 --> 01:18:18.848 position:7% line:83% align:start
We shall have to work swiftly

01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:35.748 position:19% line:83% align:start
I shall strive not to
let it happen again.

[ship horn blares]

[CIEL]
It's our rescue.

01:33:46.292 --> 01:33:48.327 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sebastian.

01:33:48.361 --> 01:33:50.295 position:13% line:83% align:start
In your current condition,
you won't be able

01:33:50.329 --> 01:33:52.665 position:27% line:83% align:start
to attend me as
a proper butler should.

01:33:52.699 --> 01:33:56.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
Once we've returned to the
manor, I want you to rest.

01:33:56.368 --> 01:33:57.704 position:13% line:89% align:start
You did quite well today.

01:33:59.337 --> 01:34:01.574 position:38% line:89% align:start
My lord.

01:34:01.607 --> 01:34:03.308 position:19% line:89% align:start
Please, you must stop.

01:34:03.341 --> 01:34:06.846 position:16% line:83% align:start
It isn't at all like you
to say such things.

01:34:06.879 --> 01:34:08.613 position:19% line:89% align:start
If you're not careful,

01:34:08.648 --> 01:34:10.917 position:21% line:83% align:start
you'll call a storm
down upon us.

01:38:22.997 --> 01:38:24.031 position:35% line:83% align:start
[WILLIAM]
Honestly!

01:38:25.232 --> 01:38:26.801 position:10% line:89% align:start
It was a simple collection,

01:38:26.834 --> 01:38:29.670 position:27% line:83% align:start
and you couldn't
even manage that.

01:38:29.704 --> 01:38:32.873 position:21% line:83% align:start
Obviously, being on
suspension has made you lazy.

01:38:32.907 --> 01:38:34.775 position:21% line:83% align:start
Poor job performance
may not bother you,

01:38:34.809 --> 01:38:37.645 position:10% line:83% align:start
but have some consideration
for your fellow Reapers!

01:38:37.678 --> 01:38:38.913 position:19% line:89% align:start
Thanks to your idiocy,

01:38:38.946 --> 01:38:41.582 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll have to work
late again today.

01:38:41.615 --> 01:38:43.217 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, on your feet.

01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:45.753 position:19% line:83% align:start
You won't get anything
done lying there.

01:38:46.988 --> 01:38:48.189 position:33% line:89% align:start
Will, dear!

01:38:48.222 --> 01:38:50.623 position:35% line:83% align:start
How sweet!
You came to fetch me!

01:38:50.657 --> 01:38:51.658 position:44% line:89% align:start
Gah!

01:38:52.326 --> 01:38:54.261 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm not here to fetch anyone.

01:38:54.295 --> 01:38:58.899 position:5% line:83% align:start
I am once again tidying up after
a certain useless temp worker.

01:38:58.933 --> 01:39:02.535 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now, stop blowing bubbles
and start collecting.

01:39:02.569 --> 01:39:04.105 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your gaze is so fierce
it's practically

01:39:04.138 --> 01:39:05.905 position:13% line:89% align:start
a human rights violation!

01:39:05.939 --> 01:39:08.875 position:21% line:83% align:start
And let me tell you,
I'm ready to be violated.

01:39:08.908 --> 01:39:10.244 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm ready for you, Will!

01:39:10.277 --> 01:39:12.679 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's no need to deny
ourselves any longer!

01:39:12.712 --> 01:39:14.014 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, Will!

01:39:14.047 --> 01:39:15.548 position:7% line:89% align:start
Will, are you listening to me?

01:39:15.582 --> 01:39:17.083 position:7% line:89% align:start
At least let me into the boat.

01:39:17.117 --> 01:39:18.184 position:38% line:89% align:start
Please!

01:39:27.027 --> 01:39:28.328 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ciel!

01:39:28.361 --> 01:39:31.297 position:38% line:89% align:start
[crying]

01:39:31.331 --> 01:39:32.632 position:33% line:89% align:start
[CIEL yells]

01:39:32.665 --> 01:39:33.900 position:33% line:83% align:start
[ELIZABETH]
Ciel!

01:39:33.933 --> 01:39:35.935 position:24% line:89% align:start
[ELIZABETH crying]

01:39:35.969 --> 01:39:37.570 position:41% line:83% align:start
[CIEL]
Ow, ow, ow!

01:39:38.805 --> 01:39:40.073 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's all right.

01:39:41.341 --> 01:39:42.876 position:30% line:89% align:start
You came back!

01:39:42.909 --> 01:39:44.077 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're here!

01:39:44.110 --> 01:39:47.347 position:13% line:83% align:start
I was so worried I'd never
see you again, but you're here!

01:39:47.380 --> 01:39:50.817 position:24% line:89% align:start
[ELIZABETH crying]

01:39:50.850 --> 01:39:51.951 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ciel!

01:39:51.985 --> 01:39:53.987 position:24% line:89% align:start
