1
00:00:38,056 --> 00:00:40,675
Until I entered high school two months ago, I thought I...

2
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:43,479
that I didn't know anything.

3
00:00:45,585 --> 00:00:47,600
The dampness of my uniform's hem...

4
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,216
wet from someone leaning an umbrella up against me.

5
00:00:51,327 --> 00:00:54,307
The smell of mothballs clinging to someone's suit...

6
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:56,195
like a ghost.

7
00:00:59,628 --> 00:01:03,667
Bodies... warm... pushing up against my back.

8
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:07,319
The chill breeze of the air conditioner against my face...

9
00:01:09,492 --> 00:01:13,353
When I was little, the sky was closer... so much closer.

10
00:01:14,672 --> 00:01:18,389
That's why I like the rain. It's
like I can smell the sky coming.

11
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:24,006
On most rainy mornings, I don't take
the transfer. I exit out the station gates.

12
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:23,791
Chocolate and... beer?

13
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,472
She looks familiar though.

14
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,644
Here.

15
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,716
Oh, Thank you.

16
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,410
Have...

17
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,871
I'm sorry, but have we met before?

18
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,186
No.

19
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,944
Right. Yeah, of course. My mistake.

20
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:53,680
It's OK.

21
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:15,258
How about this?

22
00:04:19,286 --> 00:04:23,560
A faint clap of thunder... clouded skies.

23
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:27,041
Perhaps rain come, and if so.

24
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:29,024
Will you stay with me?

25
00:05:06,684 --> 00:05:11,174
Rain conditions continue tonight
with storms covering most of Kyushu

26
00:05:11,682 --> 00:05:18,752
Nagasaki, Saga, Kumamoto, can expect to get
wet all through tonight and well into tomorrow.

27
00:05:29,638 --> 00:05:30,542
I'm home.

28
00:05:30,835 --> 00:05:31,576
Oh hey.

29
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:33,165
I bought croquettes.

30
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,598
Cool. Dinner's almost ready?

31
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:37,464
Thank you.

32
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:40,562
Where's Ma?

33
00:05:41,995 --> 00:05:42,667
Ran out.

34
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,528
More for us. Did she say anything?

35
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:49,262
Just the same note. "Don't come looking for me".

36
00:05:50,315 --> 00:05:51,478
But maybe we should...

37
00:05:51,723 --> 00:05:53,952
I'm sure she'll be back after fighting with her boyfriend.

38
00:05:58,751 --> 00:06:01,211
Oh, I've found a place. I'll be moving in next month.

39
00:06:01,674 --> 00:06:02,418
With her?

40
00:06:02,856 --> 00:06:04,199
She's ready.  I'm ready.

41
00:06:04,973 --> 00:06:07,770
That's why Mom left. You told
her you were moving in together.

42
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,911
Didn't you?

43
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:09,626
You know,

44
00:06:09,838 --> 00:06:11,696
I wish you would realize we're not kids anymore.

45
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,866
That's the only reason she dates guys our age.

46
00:06:13,965 --> 00:06:14,907
It's disgusting !

47
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,373
OK, fine.

48
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,663
Why don't I just go live with Hiro? How's that?

49
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,437
She's looks young for her age.  So what?

50
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,172
That's because she's never
worked an honest day in her life.

51
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,172
But you?

52
00:06:26,682 --> 00:06:28,706
You're the one who looks like
a 100 miles of shitty highway.

53
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,355
OK...

54
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,451
since I look so beat up, you do the dishes.

55
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:45,686
Won't you be glad to have more space?

56
00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:46,738
Suppose so.

57
00:06:47,231 --> 00:06:48,276
Help me move, OK?

58
00:06:48,894 --> 00:06:49,569
Sure.

59
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:53,758
Hey, have you heard of this?

60
00:06:56,951 --> 00:06:57,928
What is this, a haiku?

61
00:06:58,355 --> 00:06:59,475
It's a tanka.

62
00:06:59,818 --> 00:07:00,485
OK.

63
00:07:01,393 --> 00:07:02,751
Ask Ma when she gets back.

64
00:07:18,864 --> 00:07:22,932
On sunny mornings, I transfer to the
subway and head here, like I'm supposed to.

65
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:28,325
Like I'm supposed to... "What a joke!"

66
00:07:38,431 --> 00:07:39,243
It's raining...

67
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,655
Oh, good morning!

68
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:01,966
Good morning.

69
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:34,940
Hmm...

70
00:08:37,344 --> 00:08:38,765
Today a school holiday?

71
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:42,325
What about you, early retirement?

72
00:08:43,987 --> 00:08:45,360
I'm skipping work again.

73
00:08:48,665 --> 00:08:51,518
And knocking back a couple of
beers in the park apparently.

74
00:08:53,552 --> 00:08:56,500
I have to say it's not exactly
my idea of a power breakfast.

75
00:08:56,944 --> 00:08:58,126
Maybe you should eat something.

76
00:08:58,187 --> 00:08:59,850
You seem to know a lot about the subject.

77
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,363
Oh no, it's not me, I don't drink. My mom's the drinker.

78
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:06,112
So, you wanted me to eat something?

79
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:10,187
Will these do?

80
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,256
I can see it in yours eyes. You think I'm nuts !

81
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,145
No, I...

82
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,935
It's OK. I promise, I'm saner than most.

83
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,184
Just another human being, with
all the quirks, little foibles.

84
00:09:22,287 --> 00:09:23,020
Maybe...

85
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:24,869
Definitely.

86
00:09:37,988 --> 00:09:40,196
Okay, it's about time for me to go.

87
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,371
Off to school?

88
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:45,946
Rain's letting up, and that's the deal I
made. I can only cut classes on rainy days.

89
00:09:47,552 --> 00:09:49,800
Well, then maybe we'll see each other again?

90
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,826
I mean, it's going to rain again...

91
00:09:53,296 --> 00:09:54,191
...someday.

92
00:09:54,782 --> 00:09:57,307
And then... just like that.

93
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,335
It was the first day of Kanto's rainy season.

94
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,427
A shoemaker?

95
00:10:55,452 --> 00:10:58,510
I heard you. You were going to say it, a "cobbler."

96
00:10:58,963 --> 00:11:01,880
But I don't know, I like it...

97
00:11:01,998 --> 00:11:04,562
the design, I'm creating something...

98
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:07,072
truly making... something.

99
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,922
I suck at it bad, but...

100
00:11:09,432 --> 00:11:10,783
It's what I want to do.

101
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,271
I know that now... or, well, I can admit that now.

102
00:11:15,155 --> 00:11:17,257
I've never told anyone this before.

103
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,260
Do you have any idea how late you are?

104
00:11:26,497 --> 00:11:29,103
You know why I've called you
here. Don't even act like you don't.

105
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:34,672
Oh, Come on!

106
00:11:50,365 --> 00:11:52,559
Evenings, before I went to sleep...

107
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,269
Mornings, in the moment I woke up...

108
00:11:57,809 --> 00:11:58,985
I was praying...

109
00:11:59,703 --> 00:12:00,677
for rain.

110
00:12:05,573 --> 00:12:08,480
Because on sunny days, it was there...

111
00:12:09,346 --> 00:12:12,658
a place filled with children.

112
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,041
And I was filled with impatience.

113
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,989
She lives in a world where people work.

114
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:20,483
They do what they're meant to do.

115
00:12:20,651 --> 00:12:23,454
And that place is a world away from where I am.

116
00:12:24,222 --> 00:12:25,139
And she...

117
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:30,454
she represents every secret that world holds.

118
00:12:33,812 --> 00:12:36,332
Right now, I only know two things.

119
00:12:37,483 --> 00:12:41,472
One: She looks at me like I'm
just another 15 year-old kid.

120
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:45,120
And two: This is what I'm meant to do.

121
00:12:45,777 --> 00:12:48,655
It's the only thing that's going
to get me out of this place...

122
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:51,501
and into that world...

123
00:12:52,266 --> 00:12:53,518
...full of secrets.

124
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:03,548
"Please stay behind the yellow line for your safety."

125
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,053
"Please be careful of the closing doors."

126
00:13:42,357 --> 00:13:43,638
Well, hey, good morning!

127
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,483
I kind of thought you might not come today.

128
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:49,398
I mean, it's a miracle you haven't been fired yet.

129
00:13:57,216 --> 00:13:59,361
Wow! That's beautiful!

130
00:13:59,428 --> 00:14:00,218
Hey!

131
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:01,489
I can't see?

132
00:14:01,514 --> 00:14:03,594
No, not yet. Maybe never.

133
00:14:03,682 --> 00:14:04,362
Really?

134
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:05,224
Yes, really!

135
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,033
Come on, sit down over there.

136
00:14:15,012 --> 00:14:18,174
I brought breakfast.  I have enough for two.

137
00:14:19,688 --> 00:14:21,479
That's alright. I got my own.

138
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:24,468
I'm not big on talking.

139
00:14:24,653 --> 00:14:26,028
I can cook, you know.

140
00:14:26,052 --> 00:14:26,579
Oh?

141
00:14:27,277 --> 00:14:30,368
Wow! You can. Hey my mom used to make those.

142
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:32,217
Wait, I'm not really that good a...

143
00:14:34,818 --> 00:14:36,491
a cook, you know.

144
00:14:38,705 --> 00:14:39,754
Otherwise...

145
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:42,213
It's your own fault though.

146
00:14:47,482 --> 00:14:49,276
That's a side of you I didn't expect.

147
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,347
What?

148
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:54,026
Sorry. But it's tasty in its own way.

149
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:55,217
It's got bite.

150
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,390
You're just saying that.

151
00:14:56,414 --> 00:14:57,092
I'm not!

152
00:14:57,348 --> 00:14:58,227
Can I have another?

153
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,240
Hurry up!

154
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,850
Wait, bro!

155
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,940
Takao, be careful.

156
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:17,514
Happy birthday, Mom!

157
00:15:17,982 --> 00:15:19,022
Thank you.

158
00:15:19,406 --> 00:15:22,582
Oh, my baby always buys me great presents.

159
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,212
Hey...

160
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:53,665
What do you think?

161
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:56,151
Do you think it's too late for me?

162
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:21,400
The thing was... I could actually taste it. It had flavor.

163
00:16:22,335 --> 00:16:23,471
Sounds like you're better.

164
00:16:23,644 --> 00:16:25,013
I wouldn't go that far.

165
00:16:25,038 --> 00:16:28,921
It's just nice to be able to taste
something other than liquor and chocolate.

166
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,084
I think the loss? Is flavorless.

167
00:16:31,109 --> 00:16:33,307
My tongue is numb as the rest of me.

168
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:37,071
I think you deciding to just quit was really for the best.

169
00:16:37,924 --> 00:16:38,867
Maybe so.

170
00:16:39,335 --> 00:16:41,268
I hate you when you talk like this...

171
00:16:41,348 --> 00:16:44,072
Gently like you're touching
something you think you could break.

172
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,518
Because back then...

173
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:50,080
when I found it hard to even breathe

174
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,638
much less talk... you didn't believe me!

175
00:16:53,402 --> 00:16:56,462
You only heard the rumors... all the little whispers.

176
00:16:57,172 --> 00:16:59,039
Why did you believe them so quickly?

177
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,853
We'll start the resignation paperwork after the holiday.

178
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:02,889
And I'll notify the higher-ups.

179
00:17:02,913 --> 00:17:03,385
Hey...

180
00:17:04,036 --> 00:17:07,190
Thanks for doing it. I mean it's
not like we're together anymore.

181
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:08,931
I'm glad, really...

182
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:09,478
Huh?

183
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,712
About that old woman you met...

184
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:16,360
You know, the one you keep talking
about who brings her lunch box to the park.

185
00:17:16,782 --> 00:17:18,647
It seems like you've really struck a chord.

186
00:17:18,736 --> 00:17:20,864
I think it's great you have someone to talk to.

187
00:17:23,614 --> 00:17:24,882
Get some rest, OK?

188
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:34,068
Ever since then,

189
00:17:34,913 --> 00:17:35,856
I've been nothing...

190
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:38,570
Nothing but lies.

191
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:53,966
Huh?

192
00:17:55,227 --> 00:17:56,135
It's raining.

193
00:18:25,102 --> 00:18:26,561
Here, this is for you.

194
00:18:27,056 --> 00:18:27,738
For me?

195
00:18:28,492 --> 00:18:30,456
I've always ended up eating your food...

196
00:18:31,481 --> 00:18:33,141
And you said you wanted it, right?

197
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:36,534
This book isn't cheap!

198
00:18:36,973 --> 00:18:39,243
My Gosh!  Thank you so much.

199
00:18:39,304 --> 00:18:40,424
It's my pleasure.

200
00:18:48,157 --> 00:18:49,491
It's the fact that...

201
00:18:50,232 --> 00:18:53,582
Wow, I'm making a pair right now, I so need this.

202
00:18:54,113 --> 00:18:56,173
Really?  For yourself?

203
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:58,229
I haven't decided whose shoes yet...

204
00:18:58,558 --> 00:18:59,801
They're women's shoes.

205
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,364
But I haven't been able to get them right, and...

206
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,060
It just happened...

207
00:20:19,006 --> 00:20:22,843
I wasn't, like, walking anymore, and then I cried.

208
00:20:24,551 --> 00:20:27,236
I'm sorry, are you talking about your job?

209
00:20:29,087 --> 00:20:30,454
A lot of things...

210
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,507
I don't know anything about her.

211
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,162
What her job even is, her age...

212
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,531
why she's here... drinking so much...

213
00:20:43,693 --> 00:20:46,143
Why is she so... pained.

214
00:20:47,107 --> 00:20:49,364
Yeah.  So much pain.

215
00:20:50,528 --> 00:20:52,191
I don't even know her name.

216
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:55,925
I can't stop thinking about her.

217
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:10,619
"The rainy season is officially over ten
days later than normal in the Kanto region."

218
00:21:10,881 --> 00:21:13,613
"The current temperature in the city is 26 degrees."

219
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:19,309
Like someone just flicked a switch,
the sunny days came one after another.

220
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:27,253
Oh sure, now I think to myself "I'm
glad that he's not skipping class anymore."

221
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,566
But in reality...

222
00:21:33,454 --> 00:21:35,801
I wish the rainy season never ended.

223
00:21:48,643 --> 00:21:50,270
This park sure is big.

224
00:21:50,295 --> 00:21:52,095
I can't believe we're in Shinjuku.

225
00:21:52,214 --> 00:21:53,564
Oh, pardon us.

226
00:21:53,589 --> 00:21:54,299
Go ahead.

227
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:01,968
This is the Japanese gardens?

228
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,192
Where should we go next?

229
00:22:03,248 --> 00:22:05,750
Isn't there a greenhouse? Let's check it out.

230
00:22:06,231 --> 00:22:09,167
It's like a totally different place on sunny days.

231
00:22:13,113 --> 00:22:14,359
Thanks for the help.

232
00:22:14,384 --> 00:22:17,214
And, how about as a date that
you stay and have dinner with us?

233
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:19,327
Sorry, but I've got my part-time job today.

234
00:22:19,474 --> 00:22:20,581
This late?

235
00:22:20,648 --> 00:22:21,757
And I don't want to impose.

236
00:22:21,782 --> 00:22:22,655
Not at all!

237
00:22:22,818 --> 00:22:25,962
I'm going to be living with him from
now on. I mean I'll be sick of him first.

238
00:22:25,987 --> 00:22:27,333
Hey, I can hear you.

239
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,989
Well then, see you later.

240
00:22:32,621 --> 00:22:34,605
Oh, I think he's a really cute kid.

241
00:22:34,678 --> 00:22:36,271
Yeah, if don't look below his ankles.

242
00:22:36,386 --> 00:22:38,017
A handmade mocassins.

243
00:22:38,115 --> 00:22:38,995
They're awesome!

244
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:41,404
Oh, really?  C'mon they look stupid.

245
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,485
What do you know?  He might have talent.

246
00:22:43,703 --> 00:22:46,068
Hey, I wonder if he'd make a pair of them for me?

247
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:49,222
Oh, baby, come on, Takao? A designer?

248
00:22:49,364 --> 00:22:51,176
Let's just be honest about this, OK?

249
00:22:51,574 --> 00:22:54,170
My brother moved out, and the rainless days continued.

250
00:22:54,694 --> 00:22:56,902
I had no excuse to head to that place.

251
00:22:57,769 --> 00:23:00,297
August And then, it was summer vacation.

252
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,387
I worked part-time almost every day over the summer.

253
00:23:25,975 --> 00:23:28,796
The pork ramen is really hot today if you like spicy.

254
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:29,393
I like spicy.

255
00:23:29,418 --> 00:23:30,065
I'll take that too.

256
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,733
Good, I'll have it right out.

257
00:23:30,758 --> 00:23:32,652
Vocational school wasn't going to be cheap.

258
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,581
I needed to work my ass off.

259
00:23:35,044 --> 00:23:36,884
Tuition, tools, leather.

260
00:23:38,845 --> 00:23:40,443
I wasn't going to get some grant.

261
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:43,644
Sure, I missed her...

262
00:23:45,811 --> 00:23:48,737
but if I cling to those feelings
I'll never get out of here.

263
00:23:50,536 --> 00:23:53,734
I'll be stuck... and she'll be stuck.

264
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:56,809
So I'll keep working.

265
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,791
I'm going to make a pair of shoes that
will make her want to get up and walk...

266
00:24:03,596 --> 00:24:04,841
and find her way.

267
00:24:05,341 --> 00:24:08,687
What will the weather be like tomorrow?

268
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:18,410
I'm not a bit smarter at the age
of 27, than I was at the age of 15.

269
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:26,657
I've always been here, stuck... stuck in the same place.

270
00:25:17,507 --> 00:25:19,114
I can't believe it was him.

271
00:25:19,349 --> 00:25:21,128
English class is no big deal.

272
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,120
That's cause Kiso's a pushover.

273
00:25:27,855 --> 00:25:29,005
Akizuki!

274
00:25:29,555 --> 00:25:31,754
Oh, wow, look at you.

275
00:25:31,939 --> 00:25:32,672
Beach look.

276
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:34,922
I know, pretty bad. Right?

277
00:25:35,026 --> 00:25:37,874
Speak for yourself. I look
good. Why didn't we see you, dude?

278
00:25:37,899 --> 00:25:39,032
Worked the whole time.

279
00:25:39,224 --> 00:25:40,350
The whole time?

280
00:25:46,276 --> 00:25:49,289
School, part-time job, house work, that's no life man.

281
00:25:49,503 --> 00:25:51,180
I skip school sometimes!

282
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,180
Now that you mention it, you are late a lot...

283
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,250
a whole lot.

284
00:25:54,278 --> 00:25:57,001
Yep, if it's raining he never makes 1st period.

285
00:25:57,026 --> 00:25:59,725
I've got a condition where I can't
ride the subway on rainy mornings.

286
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,865
Whatever, weirdo.

287
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,547
Ms. Yukino?

288
00:26:12,767 --> 00:26:13,767
Ms. Yukino!

289
00:26:17,072 --> 00:26:17,949
Satou...

290
00:26:18,408 --> 00:26:19,070
I'm so sorry.

291
00:26:19,095 --> 00:26:21,432
Alright girls and Satou, save it for later.

292
00:26:21,457 --> 00:26:22,488
I'm sorry, everyone.

293
00:26:22,711 --> 00:26:25,999
I'll be here until after 6th
period so let's just wait until then.

294
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,411
I can't believe it.

295
00:26:31,717 --> 00:26:33,411
She is actually here.

296
00:26:38,822 --> 00:26:40,576
You didn't hear about Yuki quittin'?

297
00:26:41,203 --> 00:26:43,621
Didn't know her or hear that.

298
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,100
Then you got more class than I thought.

299
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:48,768
The third-year girls started it.

300
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,574
Oh, man, those bitches were
just merciless to that poor woman.

301
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:53,511
It was tragic.

302
00:26:57,631 --> 00:27:00,948
They were awful, and you can think what
you want. She didn't do anything wrong.

303
00:27:01,652 --> 00:27:05,269
Someone's boyfriend thought she was hot
so they were mean to her because of it.

304
00:27:05,642 --> 00:27:08,129
Those rumors got all the way to her parents.

305
00:27:08,273 --> 00:27:09,774
Her parents heard them.

306
00:27:10,074 --> 00:27:11,244
I can't imagine.

307
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,872
Then she just stopped showing up.

308
00:27:15,484 --> 00:27:18,062
I think she should have called the damn cops.

309
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:21,448
But you know if she would the
principle would have put the ee on that.

310
00:27:21,495 --> 00:27:22,935
And he wouldn't have done anything about it.

311
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,142
He didn't want anymore bad
publicity for his stupid school.

312
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:28,454
It makes me sick! He's worse than they are!

313
00:27:31,407 --> 00:27:33,038
Hey, what's the matter?

314
00:27:34,575 --> 00:27:35,786
Those upperclassmen...

315
00:27:38,565 --> 00:27:40,276
Do you... know them?

316
00:27:49,988 --> 00:27:51,350
Ms. Yukino, wait!

317
00:27:58,615 --> 00:28:00,902
Because he sucks at it and he's a loser.

318
00:28:00,927 --> 00:28:02,275
Ah, you're such a bitch.

319
00:28:02,355 --> 00:28:04,315
But man, you sure go through 'em.

320
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:15,004
What do you want, fish?

321
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:15,917
Are you Aizawa?

322
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,302
Another fan.

323
00:28:17,397 --> 00:28:18,091
Hardly.

324
00:28:18,638 --> 00:28:19,887
Who the hell are you?

325
00:28:21,514 --> 00:28:24,110
Ms. Yukino... You heard she's quitting, right?

326
00:28:24,189 --> 00:28:24,697
Huh?

327
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:28,534
Oh, please, you think I care about some slutty hag?

328
00:28:30,123 --> 00:28:31,879
What the fuck is your problem?

329
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,485
I'm gonna like this.

330
00:28:46,146 --> 00:28:47,418
Ah, holy shit.

331
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:49,441
You love her!

332
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:50,872
What a creep!

333
00:28:51,126 --> 00:28:52,796
Does he even know how old she is?

334
00:28:52,821 --> 00:28:54,254
I wonder how far he'd die.

335
00:28:54,403 --> 00:28:55,901
He looks inexperienced.

336
00:28:55,926 --> 00:28:58,411
He could do her now and not get school policy.

337
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,871
It's not legal either.

338
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:01,141
Fuck this.

339
00:29:01,218 --> 00:29:02,857
You should be thanking us.

340
00:29:29,954 --> 00:29:31,266
I'm waiting for the rain.

341
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:20,494
A faint clap of thunder

342
00:30:21,962 --> 00:30:23,596
even if rain comes not.

343
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:25,724
I will stay here

344
00:30:26,796 --> 00:30:27,968
together with you.

345
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:35,969
Yes, that's the correct answer.

346
00:30:36,842 --> 00:30:40,142
That's the right response to the
tanka I told you when we first met.

347
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:45,415
If it rains, I wonder if you will be staying here?

348
00:30:46,268 --> 00:30:48,631
In response to that verse, I answer...

349
00:30:49,227 --> 00:30:51,390
Even if it doesn't rain, I will be here.

350
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,186
I know it... classic Japanese literature.

351
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,603
And if Yukino, I...

352
00:31:03,932 --> 00:31:04,951
I'm sorry...

353
00:31:05,543 --> 00:31:09,193
I thought you would realize
it. I mean it seemed so obvious.

354
00:31:09,838 --> 00:31:13,499
Everyone in town seems to know
about the classic lit teacher.

355
00:31:14,146 --> 00:31:17,625
But then again you're always off
in your own little world, aren't you?

356
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,507
Wait a minute. What happened to your face?

357
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,390
I was acting like you and drank too much beer.

358
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,090
Then I tripped and fell on the
Yamanote [train line] platform.

359
00:31:27,158 --> 00:31:28,022
Oh, my God!

360
00:31:28,067 --> 00:31:28,856
I'm kidding.

361
00:31:29,647 --> 00:31:31,152
I got in a little fight.

362
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:19,094
I don't even know why we're running, we're soaking wet.

363
00:34:05,775 --> 00:34:06,966
I think this might...

364
00:34:08,552 --> 00:34:09,688
this might be...

365
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:12,650
...the happiest...

366
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,138
time of my life.

367
00:34:24,714 --> 00:34:25,588
I love you.

368
00:34:25,794 --> 00:34:26,334
What?

369
00:34:28,247 --> 00:34:31,719
Yukino, I can't help it. I
think I've fallen in love with you.

370
00:34:52,907 --> 00:34:53,892
Not Yukino.

371
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:55,373
Ms. Yukino.

372
00:35:07,087 --> 00:35:08,966
I'm going to be moving next week.

373
00:35:09,151 --> 00:35:11,095
Back to my hometown in Shikoku.

374
00:35:11,851 --> 00:35:13,637
I made the decision a while back.

375
00:35:17,204 --> 00:35:22,446
I was practicing how to walk
on my own, there in that place.

376
00:35:24,382 --> 00:35:25,902
Even if I'm barefoot...

377
00:35:29,896 --> 00:35:30,726
So then...

378
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:37,209
So I want to thank you for everything, Akizuki.

379
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,205
Thank you for your hospitality and for the clothes.

380
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,562
I can get changed now.

381
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,310
But wait, your shirt...

382
00:36:24,073 --> 00:36:25,203
I've got my things...

383
00:36:25,871 --> 00:36:26,691
so I'm good.

384
00:36:27,715 --> 00:36:29,759
I'm going to go now. It was nice meeting you.

385
00:37:05,024 --> 00:37:08,146
I've brought breakfast. I have enough for two.

386
00:37:09,491 --> 00:37:11,271
I haven't decided whose shoes yet.

387
00:37:11,672 --> 00:37:12,754
They're women's shoes.

388
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:15,425
I was acting like you and drank too much beer.

389
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:17,991
Then I tripped and fell on the Yamanote platform.

390
00:37:18,424 --> 00:37:19,994
A faint clap of thunder.

391
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:22,066
Even if rain comes not.

392
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:24,290
I will stay here.

393
00:37:25,269 --> 00:37:26,458
Together with you.

394
00:38:22,862 --> 00:38:23,678
Yukino...

395
00:38:25,706 --> 00:38:27,690
I want you to forget what I told you earlier.

396
00:38:29,817 --> 00:38:31,550
I couldn't love someone like you.

397
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,338
I hate you.

398
00:38:35,602 --> 00:38:37,876
I thought it the second I saw you in the park.

399
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,339
It was poison.

400
00:38:42,898 --> 00:38:46,136
Drinking beer in the morning,
quoting some stupid tanka to me...

401
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:51,485
You listening to other people's talking all day...

402
00:38:51,585 --> 00:38:53,829
just so you'd never have to
reveal a thing about yourself...

403
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:56,180
You knew who I was, I was just a kid.

404
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,310
What were you thinking? What's wrong with you?

405
00:38:58,685 --> 00:39:02,895
If I'd known you were a teacher, I would never
have told you anything about me or my dreams.

406
00:39:03,096 --> 00:39:06,612
You don't think I can do it. You don't
really think I'll ever amount to anything!

407
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,130
What? Is that why you didn't say anything to me?

408
00:39:09,386 --> 00:39:11,148
You thought maybe that you were with a little kid?

409
00:39:11,173 --> 00:39:14,080
Indulge his fantasies for a
little while. Just string him along?

410
00:39:14,445 --> 00:39:18,046
Go on, say it. I'll never measure up to my dreams.

411
00:39:18,071 --> 00:39:20,896
You knew from the beginning.
You could have just admitted it.

412
00:39:21,298 --> 00:39:22,999
But you played along.

413
00:39:24,627 --> 00:39:26,251
So tell me god damn it.

414
00:39:26,503 --> 00:39:29,740
Tell me that little kids should run along to school!

415
00:39:30,552 --> 00:39:32,298
Tell me that you hate me! Say it!

416
00:39:32,389 --> 00:39:34,768
Come on Listener, say something for a change.

417
00:39:35,731 --> 00:39:36,580
Loser!

418
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:38,574
It's because you act like that.

419
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,522
You never say what's important,

420
00:39:40,547 --> 00:39:42,365
You pretend it's none of your business.

421
00:39:42,685 --> 00:39:44,835
You've been living your whole life alone.

422
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,676
Every morning!

423
00:39:53,384 --> 00:39:56,904
Every morning I put on my suit to go to school...

424
00:39:57,587 --> 00:40:00,797
But I was... I was scared...

425
00:40:01,423 --> 00:40:03,840
I couldn't go, I couldn't go...

426
00:40:04,483 --> 00:40:07,693
But then you... you came and...

427
00:40:07,718 --> 00:40:11,985
you, you, you saved me.

428
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:17,529
Oh my God, Oh my God, you saved me...

429
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:38,073
Summer ended.  Summer uniforms became winter ones.

430
00:41:38,435 --> 00:41:41,448
Finals:  Barely squeezed by there.

431
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:45,228
I wasted who knows how many pieces of expensive leather.

432
00:41:45,591 --> 00:41:47,879
Winter break:  Part-time job again.

433
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:52,639
And every time I added a layer I-I find...

434
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:54,793
I thought of her.

435
00:45:21,872 --> 00:45:25,373
I  realize now, I was learning to walk as well.

436
00:45:26,964 --> 00:45:28,513
I haven't mastered the steps.

437
00:45:32,024 --> 00:45:33,319
But I'm on my path.

438
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:35,270
My path.

439
00:45:36,229 --> 00:45:39,806
One day that path will take me to her.
