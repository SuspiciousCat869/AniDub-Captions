00:09:36.285 --> 00:09:38.354 position:7% line:89% align:start
-What did the lab report say?

00:09:38.388 --> 00:09:40.556 position:13% line:83% align:start
TOGUSA: They think he just
lost control of the car.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:43.159 position:27% line:89% align:start
Poor visibility.

00:09:43.192 --> 00:09:45.595 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Which is very possible, since
he was driving in a rainstorm.

00:09:45.628 --> 00:09:46.996 position:21% line:89% align:start
TOGUSA: Yeah, but--

00:09:47.029 --> 00:09:49.332 position:5% line:89% align:start
-Let him make his point, Major.

00:09:49.365 --> 00:09:52.034 position:16% line:83% align:start
Regardless of what might
have been the cause of death,

00:09:52.068 --> 00:09:53.703 position:30% line:83% align:start
this agent had
inside information

00:09:53.737 --> 00:09:55.338 position:10% line:89% align:start
that may be very pertinent.

00:09:55.371 --> 00:09:56.639 position:16% line:89% align:start
We need to follow it up.

00:09:56.672 --> 00:09:58.508 position:7% line:89% align:start
But we need to do it quietly.

00:09:58.541 --> 00:09:59.609 position:21% line:89% align:start
You have three days.

00:09:59.643 --> 00:10:00.510 position:19% line:89% align:start
Find out what you can.

00:10:00.543 --> 00:10:01.544 position:13% line:89% align:start
Thank you very much, sir.

00:10:10.554 --> 00:10:13.457 position:21% line:83% align:start
So we're back on the
Laughing Man case.

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:14.525 position:24% line:89% align:start
What do you think?

00:10:14.558 --> 00:10:17.428 position:16% line:83% align:start
-I'd forgotten all about
it until he brought it up.

00:10:17.461 --> 00:10:20.564 position:5% line:83% align:start
Six years, and that same unit is
still working on the same case?

00:10:20.597 --> 00:10:22.965 position:21% line:83% align:start
-A lot of companies
were blackmailed,

00:10:22.999 --> 00:10:24.167 position:5% line:89% align:start
and they all have to be covered.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.537 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's the largest act
of corporate terrorism

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.238 position:30% line:89% align:start
since the war.

00:10:28.272 --> 00:10:30.240 position:16% line:83% align:start
Even if they drop a case
without an indictment,

00:10:30.274 --> 00:10:33.143 position:24% line:83% align:start
HQ can't back away
because of public opinion.

00:10:33.177 --> 00:10:35.646 position:21% line:83% align:start
-I still say they're
taking their sweet time.

00:10:35.679 --> 00:10:36.880 position:21% line:89% align:start
-You've got a point.

00:10:36.914 --> 00:10:40.350 position:7% line:83% align:start
Even the top execs can't agree
on the culprit of the crime.

00:10:40.384 --> 00:10:43.287 position:13% line:83% align:start
Some say it's politically
motivated extremists who

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.291 position:16% line:83% align:start
hate prosthetics and all
forms of cyber technology.

00:10:47.324 --> 00:10:50.461 position:13% line:83% align:start
Others think it's standard
corporate warfare--

00:10:50.494 --> 00:10:55.299 position:10% line:83% align:start
some conglomerate trying to
get an edge on the market.

00:10:55.332 --> 00:10:58.368 position:7% line:83% align:start
And still others believe it's
just about the ransom money.

00:10:58.402 --> 00:11:00.270 position:21% line:89% align:start
Plain old thievery.

00:11:00.304 --> 00:11:02.372 position:21% line:83% align:start
There are plenty of
theories, but no facts.

00:11:02.406 --> 00:11:04.508 position:16% line:83% align:start
They don't know if it's
one or a whole group.

00:11:04.542 --> 00:11:07.311 position:7% line:83% align:start
They don't know the suspect's
nationality, age, or sex.

00:11:07.344 --> 00:11:10.147 position:5% line:83% align:start
The only thing they agree on is
whoever broke into the system

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.150 position:13% line:89% align:start
is a super class A hacker.

00:11:13.183 --> 00:11:15.587 position:21% line:83% align:start
-He was class A when
he started this thing.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:16.621 position:10% line:89% align:start
But he couldn't sustain it.

00:11:16.654 --> 00:11:19.324 position:13% line:89% align:start
His work turned mediocre.

00:11:19.357 --> 00:11:21.459 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't like anything
about this case--

00:11:21.493 --> 00:11:24.462 position:21% line:83% align:start
not the hacker, the
corporations, or the cops.

00:11:24.496 --> 00:11:25.530 position:38% line:89% align:start
-Right.

00:11:25.563 --> 00:11:27.765 position:13% line:83% align:start
But we still have to check
out police headquarters.

00:11:27.799 --> 00:11:30.168 position:19% line:83% align:start
If there's high level
involvement in this,

00:11:30.201 --> 00:11:31.703 position:24% line:83% align:start
we have no choice
but to step in.

00:11:36.207 --> 00:11:38.276 position:35% line:89% align:start

MRS. YAMAGUCH: Mr. Togusa?

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:54.727 position:13% line:89% align:start
Thank you for coming here.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.060 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm Mrs. Yamaguchi.

00:11:58.463 --> 00:11:59.364 position:33% line:89% align:start
-I'm sorry.

00:12:03.434 --> 00:12:06.572 position:7% line:89% align:start
But how did you know who I am?

00:12:06.605 --> 00:12:07.840 position:7% line:89% align:start
-My husband told me about you.

00:12:07.873 --> 00:12:10.476 position:13% line:89% align:start
He said I could trust you.

00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:12.545 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm glad you came so
I could give you this.

00:12:12.578 --> 00:12:15.614 position:24% line:83% align:start
It arrived from my
husband this morning.

00:12:15.648 --> 00:12:18.784 position:21% line:83% align:start
He must have sent it
just before the accident.

00:12:18.817 --> 00:12:21.387 position:16% line:83% align:start
There was a note inside
saying to give it to you.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.489 position:24% line:83% align:start
He said you'd know
what to do with it.

00:12:23.522 --> 00:12:26.492 position:38% line:89% align:start
-Really?

00:12:26.525 --> 00:12:28.160 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll take a look at it.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.500 position:7% line:83% align:start
Uh, are you certain that this
is what he wanted me to see?

00:12:34.533 --> 00:12:36.502 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Yes.

00:12:36.535 --> 00:12:38.270 position:16% line:89% align:start
I mean, I'm pretty sure.

00:12:41.574 --> 00:12:43.509 position:30% line:89% align:start

Huh.

00:13:19.546 --> 00:13:20.847 position:24% line:89% align:start
What is all this?

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.816 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yamaguchi wanted me
to pick up something.

00:13:22.849 --> 00:13:23.550 position:35% line:89% align:start
But what?

00:13:37.263 --> 00:13:37.797 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wait a minute.

00:13:48.976 --> 00:13:50.543 position:35% line:89% align:start
Load C97.

00:13:50.577 --> 00:13:51.779 position:24% line:89% align:start
Enlarge 35 to 28.

00:13:56.717 --> 00:13:58.385 position:38% line:83% align:start
Nothing.
Load C98.

00:14:01.722 --> 00:14:03.423 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's got to be it.

00:14:03.456 --> 00:14:05.660 position:35% line:89% align:start
Load C96.

00:14:05.693 --> 00:14:06.794 position:30% line:89% align:start
This one, too.

00:14:06.827 --> 00:14:09.329 position:44% line:89% align:start
C92.

00:14:09.362 --> 00:14:10.363 position:27% line:89% align:start
Enlarge 4 to 13.

00:14:14.802 --> 00:14:16.437 position:24% line:89% align:start

This one, too.

00:14:26.914 --> 00:14:29.617 position:30% line:89% align:start
And this one.

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:33.521 position:13% line:83% align:start
In every photo there's one
thing missing-- the camera.

00:14:41.762 --> 00:14:44.498 position:19% line:83% align:start
ARAMAKI: Now, it makes
sense-- interceptors.

00:14:44.532 --> 00:14:45.633 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Yes.

00:14:45.666 --> 00:14:46.868 position:21% line:89% align:start
I verified the data.

00:14:46.902 --> 00:14:48.602 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yamaguchi's photos
are from the point

00:14:48.636 --> 00:14:50.972 position:16% line:83% align:start
of view of detectives in
the Laughing Man unit.

00:14:51.006 --> 00:14:52.808 position:16% line:83% align:start
They were all implanted
with interceptors

00:14:52.841 --> 00:14:54.375 position:16% line:89% align:start
without their knowledge.

00:14:54.408 --> 00:14:56.343 position:27% line:83% align:start
-So this is the
suspicious activity

00:14:56.377 --> 00:14:57.713 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yamaguchi tried
to warn you about,

00:14:57.746 --> 00:14:59.648 position:19% line:83% align:start
and he thought it went
all the way to the top.

00:14:59.681 --> 00:15:01.016 position:35% line:89% align:start
-Yes, sir.

00:15:01.049 --> 00:15:02.951 position:21% line:83% align:start
-It may be a little
irregular to implant them

00:15:02.984 --> 00:15:05.252 position:21% line:83% align:start
in your own agents,
but it's not illegal.

00:15:05.286 --> 00:15:07.422 position:21% line:83% align:start
Headquarters can use
interceptors all they want,

00:15:07.456 --> 00:15:09.290 position:19% line:83% align:start
as long as they submit
the right paperwork.

00:15:09.323 --> 00:15:11.426 position:27% line:83% align:start
-But they didn't
submit any paperwork.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:12.928 position:10% line:89% align:start
This was all done in secret.

00:15:12.961 --> 00:15:15.497 position:16% line:83% align:start
Also, the law requires a
neutral third party observer.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.933 position:21% line:83% align:start
They didn't have one
of those, either.

00:15:17.966 --> 00:15:19.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
The original intent was
to plant interceptors

00:15:20.001 --> 00:15:21.870 position:5% line:89% align:start
in key suspects they identified.

00:15:21.903 --> 00:15:24.005 position:13% line:83% align:start
But instead, they brought
the investigation team

00:15:24.039 --> 00:15:25.774 position:24% line:83% align:start
in for some bogus
medical checkups,

00:15:25.807 --> 00:15:27.743 position:21% line:83% align:start
and they planted the
interceptors in them.

00:15:27.776 --> 00:15:29.811 position:19% line:83% align:start
As far as I can tell,
every guy in the department

00:15:29.845 --> 00:15:32.048 position:21% line:83% align:start
was under round the
clock surveillance.

00:15:32.081 --> 00:15:34.382 position:13% line:83% align:start
-I've heard of monitoring
on the job performance,

00:15:34.416 --> 00:15:36.585 position:27% line:83% align:start
but that's going
a little too far.

00:15:36.618 --> 00:15:38.587 position:27% line:83% align:start
By the way, it's
Serano Genomics that

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.455 position:16% line:83% align:start
sells these interceptors
to the police.

00:15:40.489 --> 00:15:42.491 position:24% line:89% align:start
Isn't that right?

00:15:42.524 --> 00:15:44.392 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Looks like the victim
in this incident

00:15:44.426 --> 00:15:47.462 position:16% line:83% align:start
is also supplying their
products to the police.

00:15:47.496 --> 00:15:49.732 position:30% line:83% align:start
There must be
something behind this.

00:15:49.766 --> 00:15:51.399 position:30% line:89% align:start
-It's strange.

00:15:51.433 --> 00:15:52.668 position:16% line:83% align:start
There are detectives who
have been assigned to monitor

00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:56.005 position:7% line:83% align:start
Serano, and they've also been
implanted with interceptors.

00:15:56.038 --> 00:15:57.774 position:24% line:83% align:start
Neither Serano nor
the agents know

00:15:57.807 --> 00:16:00.076 position:19% line:83% align:start
these interceptors are
recording everything.

00:16:00.109 --> 00:16:02.979 position:13% line:83% align:start
-For friends, they're sure
not on very good terms.

00:16:03.012 --> 00:16:05.448 position:19% line:83% align:start
-We've got the pieces
of the puzzle now.

00:16:05.481 --> 00:16:07.817 position:19% line:83% align:start
So we need to move on
this as soon as possible.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:11.454 position:19% line:83% align:start
But we don't have the
goods to confront them yet.

00:16:11.487 --> 00:16:13.556 position:21% line:83% align:start
-In that case, let's
shake them up a little.

00:16:35.678 --> 00:16:37.814 position:24% line:83% align:start
and he handled the
initial investigations.

00:16:37.847 --> 00:16:40.050 position:5% line:83% align:start
It looks like there's something
his people want to keep

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:43.120 position:7% line:83% align:start
in house, and they're going to
great lengths to cover it up.

00:16:43.153 --> 00:16:47.623 position:10% line:83% align:start
MAN: Thank you, gentlemen.
We're ready for your statement.

00:16:47.657 --> 00:16:50.761 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Last week, certain publications
alleged that interceptors were

00:16:50.794 --> 00:16:54.731 position:5% line:83% align:start
being used in violation of legal
standards, standards that were

00:16:54.765 --> 00:16:57.668 position:19% line:83% align:start
set out by the Sensory
Perception Surveillance Act.

00:16:57.701 --> 00:17:00.637 position:19% line:83% align:start
Therefore, an internal
investigation was ordered.

00:17:00.671 --> 00:17:03.140 position:19% line:83% align:start
Subsequently, Captain
Kunihiko Nibu,

00:17:03.173 --> 00:17:05.442 position:27% line:83% align:start
Chief of Special
Investigations Unit,

00:17:05.475 --> 00:17:08.579 position:13% line:83% align:start
admitted to participating
in these acts.

00:17:08.612 --> 00:17:10.848 position:19% line:83% align:start
After the Laughing Man
investigation hit a dead end,

00:17:10.881 --> 00:17:13.784 position:13% line:83% align:start
Captain Nibu attempted to
gather additional information

00:17:13.817 --> 00:17:16.119 position:13% line:83% align:start
by implanting interceptors
in his detectives

00:17:16.153 --> 00:17:18.989 position:5% line:89% align:start
against department regulations.

00:17:19.022 --> 00:17:22.025 position:21% line:83% align:start
Captain Nibu regrets
having taken these actions.

00:17:22.059 --> 00:17:25.062 position:10% line:83% align:start
He stated that he lost sound
judgment due to stress caused

00:17:25.096 --> 00:17:27.731 position:5% line:89% align:start
by severe setbacks in the case.

00:17:27.764 --> 00:17:30.101 position:7% line:83% align:start
Despite the captain's apology,
the fact of the matter

00:17:30.134 --> 00:17:33.770 position:5% line:83% align:start
is his actions deviated from his
professional responsibilities.

00:17:33.804 --> 00:17:36.074 position:27% line:83% align:start
Therefore, as of
today, Captain Nibu

00:17:36.107 --> 00:17:39.043 position:13% line:83% align:start
has been given an official
disciplinary dismissal.

00:17:39.077 --> 00:17:40.744 position:24% line:83% align:start
And we offer those
investigators who

00:17:40.777 --> 00:17:43.513 position:10% line:83% align:start
were assigned to this case,
as well as their families,

00:17:43.547 --> 00:17:47.517 position:21% line:83% align:start
our deepest and most
sincere apologies.

00:17:47.551 --> 00:17:48.786 position:24% line:83% align:start
PRESS MEMBER: What
about senior officials?

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.121 position:16% line:89% align:start
Aren't they implicated?

00:17:50.154 --> 00:17:51.689 position:21% line:83% align:start
-I believe that the
commissioner will

00:17:51.723 --> 00:17:53.625 position:5% line:89% align:start
be issuing a statement shortly.

00:17:53.658 --> 00:17:55.459 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Wasn't there a
conflict of interest

00:17:55.492 --> 00:17:57.795 position:19% line:83% align:start
when Serano sold these
devices to the police?

00:17:57.829 --> 00:18:00.164 position:19% line:83% align:start
-I was told the agency
followed strict guidelines

00:18:00.198 --> 00:18:01.799 position:5% line:89% align:start
when it purchased these devices.

00:18:01.833 --> 00:18:03.835 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's my understanding
that they were selected

00:18:03.868 --> 00:18:07.105 position:5% line:83% align:start
through a formal bidding system
that is carefully regulated.

00:18:07.138 --> 00:18:08.873 position:24% line:83% align:start
PRESS MEMBER: What
kind of answer is that?

00:18:08.907 --> 00:18:12.710 position:7% line:83% align:start
Wasn't it the police who asked
for this new surveillance law?

00:18:12.744 --> 00:18:13.645 position:44% line:89% align:start
-Ha.

00:18:13.678 --> 00:18:15.580 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Uh, sir, is it true
that you're planning

00:18:15.613 --> 00:18:17.649 position:24% line:83% align:start
to retire soon and
relocate to Holland?

00:18:17.682 --> 00:18:19.617 position:30% line:83% align:start
And is it also
true that Serano's

00:18:19.651 --> 00:18:21.019 position:19% line:83% align:start
corporate headquarters
are in Holland?

00:18:21.052 --> 00:18:24.555 position:33% line:83% align:start
Is there any
connection there, sir?

00:18:24.589 --> 00:18:25.657 position:24% line:83% align:start
SERANO: Those are
personal questions

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:27.458 position:33% line:83% align:start
that I'm not
obligated to answer.

00:18:27.492 --> 00:18:28.893 position:24% line:83% align:start
PRESS MEMBER: What
does that mean?

00:18:28.927 --> 00:18:31.696 position:27% line:89% align:start
-Never changes.

00:18:31.729 --> 00:18:32.398 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's weird.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.465 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is the cameraman drunk or what?

00:18:34.499 --> 00:18:43.876 position:24% line:89% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: You

00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:46.477 position:41% line:83% align:start
a bit,
Superintendent-General Daido.

00:18:46.511 --> 00:18:49.547 position:16% line:83% align:start
Pleased to meet you, but
you already know who I am,

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:50.983 position:35% line:89% align:start
don't you?

00:18:51.016 --> 00:18:53.819 position:24% line:89% align:start
[crowd muttering]

00:18:53.852 --> 00:18:55.254 position:33% line:89% align:start
-That's him.

00:18:55.287 --> 00:18:56.789 position:7% line:89% align:start
-What's wrong with this thing?

00:19:01.694 --> 00:19:02.995 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Hey, what's the
matter with Takakawa?

00:19:06.098 --> 00:19:09.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
-You know, Mr. Daido,
I tried to avoid this.

00:19:09.535 --> 00:19:13.038 position:10% line:83% align:start
I didn't want to be involved
in your world any longer.

00:19:13.072 --> 00:19:15.107 position:24% line:83% align:start
I was honestly fed
up with you people

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:18.110 position:27% line:83% align:start
and your rotting
rubbish heap of a world.

00:19:18.143 --> 00:19:20.646 position:16% line:83% align:start
So I haven't interfered
with the little farce you've

00:19:20.679 --> 00:19:23.283 position:24% line:83% align:start
been staging since
the incident occurred,

00:19:23.316 --> 00:19:26.785 position:7% line:89% align:start
even though I knew everything.

00:19:26.819 --> 00:19:30.123 position:7% line:83% align:start
You could say I was exhausted
from my fruitless exertions.

00:19:35.228 --> 00:19:36.930 position:16% line:89% align:start
-Hey, you watching this?

00:19:36.963 --> 00:19:39.065 position:19% line:83% align:start
That guy's cyberbrain
is being hacked.

00:19:39.099 --> 00:19:41.734 position:7% line:83% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: But I've changed
my mind, because, well, this

00:19:41.768 --> 00:19:44.204 position:24% line:83% align:start
show you've put on
today is pitiful.

00:19:44.237 --> 00:19:46.172 position:5% line:89% align:start
A farce is supposed to be funny.

00:19:46.206 --> 00:19:48.574 position:21% line:83% align:start
But this one hasn't
made me laugh even once.

00:19:48.607 --> 00:19:50.877 position:27% line:83% align:start
And so, with the
utmost reluctance,

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:53.913 position:5% line:89% align:start
I must challenge you once again.

00:19:53.947 --> 00:19:55.582 position:21% line:83% align:start
You and your comedy
troupe are going

00:19:55.615 --> 00:19:57.984 position:27% line:83% align:start
to reconvene in
three days, right?

00:19:58.018 --> 00:20:01.254 position:19% line:83% align:start
When you do, tell the
truth this time, won't you?

00:20:01.287 --> 00:20:03.023 position:27% line:83% align:start
Because when the
curtain goes up,

00:20:03.056 --> 00:20:05.291 position:19% line:83% align:start
if you put on another
performance that rings as false

00:20:05.325 --> 00:20:11.931 position:7% line:83% align:start
as this one, I will be forced
to remove you from the stage.

00:20:11.965 --> 00:20:13.133 position:35% line:89% align:start
-Takakawa.

00:20:13.166 --> 00:20:13.933 position:24% line:89% align:start
Call an ambulance.

00:20:13.967 --> 00:20:16.169 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hurry!

00:20:16.203 --> 00:20:19.806 position:10% line:83% align:start
-And we are now returning to
the studio for a brief recap.

00:20:19.839 --> 00:20:20.740 position:21% line:89% align:start
At the conference--

00:20:24.778 --> 00:20:29.216 position:10% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: February 3, 2024--
Serano's kidnapping occurred

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:31.751 position:16% line:83% align:start
two days earlier, but no
announcements were made

00:20:31.785 --> 00:20:34.654 position:27% line:83% align:start
in order to keep
the press at bay.

00:20:34.687 --> 00:20:37.291 position:16% line:83% align:start
This case was difficult
as hell, and investigators

00:20:37.324 --> 00:20:39.160 position:13% line:89% align:start
didn't find a single clue.

00:20:39.193 --> 00:20:43.330 position:7% line:83% align:start
Then, ironically, it suddenly
broke with that media stunt.

00:20:43.364 --> 00:20:47.301 position:7% line:83% align:start
This is where it all began-- a
theatrical crime widely known

00:20:47.334 --> 00:20:50.171 position:13% line:89% align:start
as Laughing Man Incident.

00:20:50.204 --> 00:20:52.973 position:5% line:83% align:start
According to the detectives who
worked on the case back then,

00:20:53.007 --> 00:20:56.043 position:21% line:83% align:start
Mr. Serano received
warnings prior to the event

00:20:56.077 --> 00:20:59.013 position:10% line:83% align:start
by word of mouth from people
that were close to him.

00:20:59.046 --> 00:21:01.682 position:16% line:83% align:start
But because their cyber
brains had been hacked,

00:21:01.715 --> 00:21:04.752 position:24% line:83% align:start
he didn't take the
situation seriously.

00:21:04.785 --> 00:21:06.654 position:24% line:83% align:start
Immediately after,
Serano himself

00:21:06.687 --> 00:21:09.190 position:21% line:83% align:start
was cyber hacked and
kidnapped from his home.

00:21:09.223 --> 00:21:12.760 position:19% line:83% align:start
An enormous ransom was
demanded for 10 billion yen

00:21:12.793 --> 00:21:15.029 position:21% line:83% align:start
and a hundred kilos
of gold bullion.

00:21:15.062 --> 00:21:18.632 position:16% line:83% align:start
Following that, however,
all contact was lost.

00:21:18.666 --> 00:21:20.901 position:21% line:83% align:start
Up until he appeared
on that TV broadcast,

00:21:20.935 --> 00:21:22.636 position:24% line:83% align:start
there had been no
inkling of news

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:26.141 position:10% line:89% align:start
about Mr. Serano whatsoever.

00:21:26.174 --> 00:21:29.945 position:7% line:83% align:start
And while the Laughing Man was
threatening Serano on live TV,

00:21:29.978 --> 00:21:32.380 position:16% line:83% align:start
he took the opportunity
to plaster his logo

00:21:32.414 --> 00:21:35.683 position:16% line:83% align:start
over the camera's AI and
the eyes of onlookers,

00:21:35.716 --> 00:21:37.285 position:27% line:83% align:start
including those
of the TV station

00:21:37.319 --> 00:21:40.956 position:7% line:89% align:start
staff-- all done in real time.

00:21:40.989 --> 00:21:43.024 position:27% line:83% align:start
The Laughing Man
fled from police

00:21:43.058 --> 00:21:44.826 position:7% line:89% align:start
when they rushed to the scene.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.864 position:7% line:5% align:start
Yet, despite the fact that so
many people saw the suspect,

00:21:48.897 --> 00:21:51.366 position:19% line:83% align:start
the only ones who were
able to see his real face

00:21:51.399 --> 00:21:54.302 position:13% line:5% align:start
were two homeless men who
had not been cyberized.

00:21:54.336 --> 00:21:56.438 position:30% line:83% align:start
The reports of
those who testified

00:21:56.472 --> 00:21:58.773 position:21% line:83% align:start
seeing the Laughing
Man's face are famous.

00:21:58.807 --> 00:22:01.109 position:30% line:83% align:start
Based on these
eyewitness accounts,

00:22:01.143 --> 00:22:04.079 position:13% line:83% align:start
detectives came up with a
composite sketch of the logo

00:22:04.112 --> 00:22:05.847 position:33% line:89% align:start
every time.

00:22:05.881 --> 00:22:08.216 position:27% line:83% align:start
This bizarre and
disturbing incident,

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:10.852 position:27% line:83% align:start
along with that
twisted pop icon,

00:22:10.886 --> 00:22:13.189 position:16% line:83% align:start
gained popularity among
a lot of young people

00:22:13.222 --> 00:22:15.158 position:10% line:89% align:start
and subculture commentators.

00:22:15.191 --> 00:22:17.326 position:30% line:83% align:start
At its peak of
popularity, the logo

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.995 position:16% line:83% align:start
could be seen plastered
all over the city,

00:22:20.028 --> 00:22:22.998 position:7% line:83% align:start
and store shelves were filled
with branded merchandise.

00:22:23.032 --> 00:22:26.002 position:19% line:83% align:start
At the same time, acts
of corporate terrorism

00:22:26.035 --> 00:22:28.037 position:24% line:83% align:start
were occurring one
after the other,

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:31.340 position:10% line:83% align:start
while the popularity of the
icon had even reached the point

00:22:31.374 --> 00:22:35.244 position:19% line:83% align:start
where it was featured
on TV programs.

00:22:35.278 --> 00:22:38.214 position:10% line:5% align:start
-Hot on the heels of Serano,
Japan Micro Industries

00:22:38.247 --> 00:22:41.350 position:5% line:5% align:start
has apparently been blackmailed
by the notorious Laughing Man.

00:22:41.384 --> 00:22:42.285 position:21% line:5% align:start
This is incredible.

00:22:42.318 --> 00:22:43.352 position:27% line:5% align:start
What are those?

00:22:43.386 --> 00:22:45.888 position:13% line:5% align:start
It looks like a warehouse
load of office desks?

00:22:45.922 --> 00:22:47.290 position:27% line:5% align:start
How in the world
were they all moved

00:22:47.323 --> 00:22:48.824 position:13% line:5% align:start
up here in a single night?

00:22:48.858 --> 00:22:50.793 position:24% line:5% align:start
The head office of
Sagawa Electronics

00:22:50.826 --> 00:22:52.461 position:21% line:5% align:start
has been blackmailed
this time, and I'm

00:22:52.495 --> 00:22:55.064 position:13% line:5% align:start
pretty sure this qualifies
as an unprecedented act

00:22:55.097 --> 00:22:56.766 position:16% line:5% align:start
of corporate terrorism.

00:22:56.799 --> 00:22:58.067 position:38% line:89% align:start
-Listen.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.002 position:21% line:89% align:start
The real one, right?

00:23:00.036 --> 00:23:03.773 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Please call
Nanoplant Industries.

00:23:03.806 --> 00:23:06.842 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Satsuma Meditech is the most
powerful corporation in Kyushu.

00:23:06.876 --> 00:23:07.743 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't you know?

00:23:07.777 --> 00:23:09.812 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why would you go in
and plant a murder

00:23:09.845 --> 00:23:11.180 position:27% line:83% align:start
virus in there,
for heaven's sake?

00:23:11.215 --> 00:23:11.981 position:30% line:5% align:start
-I don't know.

00:23:12.014 --> 00:23:14.184 position:24% line:5% align:start
I imagine somebody
managed to hack

00:23:14.218 --> 00:23:16.253 position:21% line:5% align:start
into the landscaping
robots during the night.

00:23:16.286 --> 00:23:19.456 position:44% line:5% align:start
Go!
Look.

00:23:19.489 --> 00:23:20.257 position:35% line:5% align:start
It's him.

00:23:24.061 --> 00:23:25.861 position:27% line:83% align:start
-This MO matches
the threat against

00:23:25.895 --> 00:23:27.397 position:10% line:89% align:start
the superintendent-general.

00:23:27.431 --> 00:23:29.933 position:19% line:83% align:start
If this guy really did
all this by himself,

00:23:29.967 --> 00:23:31.902 position:24% line:83% align:start
he's definitely a
super class A hacker.

00:23:34.972 --> 00:23:37.908 position:10% line:83% align:start
But this timeworn kidnapping
case is beneath his abilities.

00:23:44.314 --> 00:23:46.316 position:21% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: After his
shocking and dramatic debut,

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:48.385 position:19% line:83% align:start
he avoided the public
eye and went on

00:23:48.418 --> 00:23:51.021 position:27% line:83% align:start
to blackmail the
Serano Corporation.

00:23:51.054 --> 00:23:53.857 position:10% line:83% align:start
He did this by planting the
Virus Program Unto Death

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:56.461 position:27% line:83% align:start
into their micro
machine production line.

00:23:56.494 --> 00:23:58.195 position:30% line:83% align:start
When sales of
their main chronic,

00:23:58.228 --> 00:24:01.064 position:16% line:83% align:start
medical micro machines,
drastically slowed

00:24:01.098 --> 00:24:03.934 position:16% line:83% align:start
and the price of Serano
stock took a nosedive,

00:24:03.967 --> 00:24:08.171 position:7% line:83% align:start
the blackmail quickly stopped,
as if that was the goal along.

00:24:08.205 --> 00:24:11.942 position:7% line:83% align:start
He then blackmailed six other
micro machine manufacturers,

00:24:11.975 --> 00:24:16.114 position:13% line:83% align:start
hitting one after another
using his unique method.

00:24:16.147 --> 00:24:18.583 position:24% line:83% align:start
This continued for
about three months.

00:24:18.616 --> 00:24:20.817 position:21% line:83% align:start
It sort of makes me
wonder if blackmail

00:24:20.851 --> 00:24:24.055 position:30% line:83% align:start
really was the
underlying motive.

00:24:24.088 --> 00:24:26.024 position:10% line:89% align:start
What was his true objective?

00:24:26.057 --> 00:24:28.259 position:21% line:83% align:start
Did he act alone, or
as part of a group?

00:24:28.293 --> 00:24:30.228 position:13% line:89% align:start
What's his race, his age?

00:24:30.261 --> 00:24:32.096 position:13% line:83% align:start
Is there something hidden
in his criminal philosophy?

00:24:35.199 --> 00:24:37.835 position:16% line:83% align:start
He left a hell of a lot
of unanswered riddles.

00:24:37.869 --> 00:24:40.405 position:30% line:83% align:start
Then, all of a
sudden, he vanished

00:24:40.438 --> 00:24:41.973 position:10% line:89% align:start
into the shadows of the net.

00:24:49.113 --> 00:24:51.382 position:5% line:83% align:start
-With regard to the announcement
of the news conference

00:24:51.416 --> 00:24:54.553 position:5% line:83% align:start
last night by the Laughing Man,
a terrorist who has resurfaced

00:24:54.586 --> 00:24:58.490 position:7% line:83% align:start
after six years, I consider it
to be an elaborate farce that

00:24:58.524 --> 00:25:01.092 position:19% line:83% align:start
was pulled off by the
Metropolitan Police.

00:25:01.125 --> 00:25:02.328 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Hold on.

00:25:02.361 --> 00:25:05.196 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'll admit that this threat
pushed the interceptor misuse

00:25:05.229 --> 00:25:06.964 position:27% line:83% align:start
matter clear out
of the limelight.

00:25:06.998 --> 00:25:09.368 position:16% line:83% align:start
But isn't your reasoning
a bit far fetched?

00:25:09.401 --> 00:25:11.069 position:27% line:89% align:start
I mean, come on.

00:25:11.102 --> 00:25:12.036 position:30% line:89% align:start
-Yeah, Chief.

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:14.406 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's not like you to
make accusations rashly.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.408 position:30% line:83% align:start
Are you basing
this on something?

00:25:16.442 --> 00:25:17.343 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Mmhm.
Togusa.

00:25:17.376 --> 00:25:22.014 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Sir.

00:25:22.047 --> 00:25:23.982 position:24% line:89% align:start
ARAMAKI: Nanao Ei.

00:25:24.016 --> 00:25:26.952 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's a material witness
in the Laughing Man case.

00:25:26.985 --> 00:25:29.488 position:16% line:83% align:start
The Metro Police Special
Investigations Unit

00:25:29.521 --> 00:25:30.656 position:27% line:83% align:start
has had this man
under surveillance

00:25:30.689 --> 00:25:32.524 position:24% line:83% align:start
available for the
past three months.

00:25:32.558 --> 00:25:33.692 position:24% line:89% align:start
-Are you kidding?

00:25:33.726 --> 00:25:36.462 position:10% line:83% align:start
He seems like any run of the
mill office jockey to me.

00:25:36.495 --> 00:25:38.030 position:30% line:89% align:start
-Yeah, I know.

00:25:38.063 --> 00:25:40.632 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's certainly not
how I had imagined him.

00:25:40.666 --> 00:25:44.036 position:13% line:83% align:start
I figured the Laughing Man
would be a lot younger than him.

00:25:44.069 --> 00:25:45.471 position:24% line:83% align:start
ARAMAKI: According
to the SIU's records,

00:25:45.504 --> 00:25:47.539 position:21% line:83% align:start
he had been working
on event for Serano

00:25:47.574 --> 00:25:51.678 position:13% line:89% align:start
Genomics as a programmer.

00:25:51.711 --> 00:25:54.246 position:21% line:83% align:start
A year into the job,
though, a tip to the company

00:25:54.279 --> 00:25:58.451 position:21% line:83% align:start
exposed his activist
past, and he was let go.

00:25:58.485 --> 00:26:00.520 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Pretty straightforward
resume, Chief.

00:26:00.553 --> 00:26:01.654 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Yes.

00:26:01.688 --> 00:26:04.223 position:27% line:83% align:start
However, Special
Investigations HQ

00:26:04.256 --> 00:26:07.092 position:7% line:83% align:start
has suddenly started turning
up more circumstantial evidence

00:26:07.126 --> 00:26:09.995 position:16% line:83% align:start
that leads them to think
that Nanao is their man.

00:26:10.028 --> 00:26:11.698 position:27% line:83% align:start
-The SIU focused
its investigation

00:26:11.731 --> 00:26:14.134 position:19% line:83% align:start
on the grudge against
Serano angle this time.

00:26:14.167 --> 00:26:15.968 position:7% line:89% align:start
They're tailing him right now.

00:26:16.001 --> 00:26:18.171 position:16% line:83% align:start
And as soon as they link
Nanao to the threat,

00:26:18.204 --> 00:26:20.273 position:19% line:83% align:start
they're just going to
move in and arrest him.

00:26:20.306 --> 00:26:21.174 position:30% line:89% align:start
-Those idiots.

00:26:21.207 --> 00:26:23.143 position:24% line:83% align:start
There ain't no way
in hell that doofus

00:26:23.176 --> 00:26:24.544 position:13% line:89% align:start
could be the Laughing Man.

00:26:24.577 --> 00:26:26.713 position:19% line:83% align:start
That guys is battered
and deep-fried in guilt,

00:26:26.746 --> 00:26:28.114 position:21% line:89% align:start
he defines innocent.

00:26:28.148 --> 00:26:30.650 position:13% line:89% align:start
ARAMAKI: I agree with you.

00:26:30.683 --> 00:26:33.553 position:13% line:83% align:start
Why, then, would Special
Investigations swallow the bait

00:26:33.586 --> 00:26:35.188 position:27% line:83% align:start
when anyone else
can easily tell it's

00:26:35.221 --> 00:26:38.191 position:21% line:83% align:start
a decoy if they look
at the big picture?

00:26:38.224 --> 00:26:40.427 position:21% line:83% align:start
Besides, this whole
interceptor nonsense--

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.295 position:24% line:83% align:start
there's something
we can't ignore.

00:26:42.328 --> 00:26:45.265 position:7% line:83% align:start
Don't forget police conspiracy
as a part of the equation,

00:26:45.298 --> 00:26:47.535 position:10% line:83% align:start
because it's still a theory
that's worth considering.

00:26:47.568 --> 00:26:51.070 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Well, since he-- Yamaguchi
was killed in the cross fire,

00:26:51.104 --> 00:26:53.072 position:35% line:89% align:start
probably.

00:26:53.106 --> 00:26:55.275 position:5% line:89% align:start
-I don't have any hard evidence.

00:26:55.308 --> 00:26:57.411 position:21% line:83% align:start
But if we can catch
Nanao Ei, who's

00:26:57.445 --> 00:26:59.580 position:19% line:83% align:start
been playing the role
of the Laughing Man

00:26:59.613 --> 00:27:02.416 position:10% line:83% align:start
and this elusive something
that's managed to fool the SIU,

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:05.084 position:24% line:83% align:start
the answer should
surface on its own.

00:27:05.118 --> 00:27:07.688 position:21% line:83% align:start
We have two days to
find that something.

00:27:07.721 --> 00:27:09.088 position:35% line:89% align:start
-Oh, yeah.

00:27:09.122 --> 00:27:11.024 position:24% line:83% align:start
We sure uncorked a
big can of worms.

00:27:11.057 --> 00:27:12.293 position:38% line:89% align:start
-Right.

00:27:12.326 --> 00:27:15.162 position:5% line:83% align:start
You and Togusa, locate Nanao Ei
and start 24 hour surveillance.

00:27:15.196 --> 00:27:17.398 position:35% line:89% align:start
-Yes, sir.

00:27:17.431 --> 00:27:18.399 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't screw up.

00:27:18.432 --> 00:27:20.568 position:19% line:83% align:start
TOGUSA: Don't you get
bored and wander off.

00:27:20.601 --> 00:27:22.670 position:13% line:83% align:start
ARAMAKI: The rest of you,
follow the major's instructions

00:27:22.703 --> 00:27:24.371 position:24% line:83% align:start
and find out who's
duping the SIU.

00:27:24.405 --> 00:27:28.209 position:30% line:89% align:start
ALL: Yes, sir.

00:27:28.242 --> 00:27:30.444 position:19% line:83% align:start
-So what is it, Major?
-Nothing.

00:27:42.256 --> 00:27:45.426 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Chief, I'm getting off of the
Nanao case as of this minute,

00:27:45.459 --> 00:27:48.028 position:16% line:83% align:start
and I could use the help
of Saito and Pazu as well.

00:27:48.062 --> 00:27:49.598 position:10% line:89% align:start
-What have you got in mind?

00:27:49.631 --> 00:27:52.199 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Protecting the
superintendent general.

00:27:52.233 --> 00:27:53.802 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think your hunch
was on the money,

00:27:53.835 --> 00:27:55.302 position:19% line:83% align:start
but I can't shake the
feeling that there's

00:27:55.336 --> 00:27:57.672 position:10% line:89% align:start
one piece which doesn't fit.

00:27:57.706 --> 00:27:59.508 position:21% line:83% align:start
My ghost is telling
me to tail Daido

00:27:59.541 --> 00:28:01.676 position:7% line:89% align:start
now to discover what that is.

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:03.378 position:19% line:89% align:start
I hear it, whispering.

00:28:07.716 --> 00:28:09.083 position:33% line:89% align:start
-All right.

00:28:09.116 --> 00:28:10.519 position:5% line:89% align:start
You know what needs to be done.

00:28:10.552 --> 00:28:12.721 position:19% line:83% align:start
Every Section 9 member
has a unique ability,

00:28:12.754 --> 00:28:14.589 position:7% line:89% align:start
and you work best on your own.

00:28:14.623 --> 00:28:18.093 position:10% line:83% align:start
But individual success is a
reflection of strong teamwork.

00:28:18.126 --> 00:28:19.794 position:27% line:89% align:start
-Thanks, Chief.

00:28:19.828 --> 00:28:21.596 position:21% line:83% align:start
Put the word out to
Saito and Pazu, OK?

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:28.570 position:24% line:89% align:start
ARAMAKI: It's me.

00:28:28.603 --> 00:28:31.273 position:19% line:89% align:start
What's Nanao's status?

00:28:31.306 --> 00:28:33.375 position:24% line:83% align:start
TOGUSA: No sign of
any activity yet.

00:28:33.408 --> 00:28:35.343 position:19% line:83% align:start
He's still sending out
emails sporadically.

00:28:41.651 --> 00:28:45.621 position:27% line:89% align:start
[phone ringing]

00:28:45.655 --> 00:28:47.355 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Yes?

00:28:47.389 --> 00:28:49.725 position:10% line:89% align:start
Thank you for all your help.

00:28:49.759 --> 00:28:53.361 position:7% line:83% align:start
that was only one of the plans
I had worked out in advance.

00:28:53.395 --> 00:28:54.664 position:33% line:89% align:start
Well, then.

00:28:54.697 --> 00:28:56.432 position:24% line:83% align:start
I hope you'll look
forward to it.

00:28:56.465 --> 00:28:57.633 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:28:57.667 --> 00:28:58.266 position:27% line:89% align:start
Good bye, then.

00:29:01.571 --> 00:29:03.204 position:24% line:89% align:start
No, it wasn't me.

00:29:03.239 --> 00:29:04.507 position:10% line:89% align:start
I didn't issue that warning.

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:05.441 position:30% line:89% align:start
But no matter.

00:29:05.474 --> 00:29:07.677 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's because it
will all be over soon.

00:29:20.923 --> 00:29:22.792 position:24% line:77% align:start
SAITO: Major, the
Superindendent General has
entered the building.

00:29:22.825 --> 00:29:23.793 position:21% line:89% align:start
MAN: Routine check.

00:29:23.826 --> 00:29:24.760 position:10% line:89% align:start
Our man is in the building.

00:29:24.794 --> 00:29:27.597 position:21% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: Chief, how
are things on your end?

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:28.731 position:24% line:89% align:start
ISHIKAWA: Got it.

00:29:28.764 --> 00:29:31.902 position:27% line:83% align:start
Like it says in
the SIU's report,

00:29:31.935 --> 00:29:34.370 position:19% line:83% align:start
Nanao's activities at
the time of each crime

00:29:34.403 --> 00:29:36.673 position:10% line:83% align:start
overwhelmingly substantiate
the possibility

00:29:36.707 --> 00:29:38.507 position:10% line:89% align:start
that he's the Laughing Man.

00:29:38.541 --> 00:29:41.377 position:10% line:83% align:start
But during my investigation
of those 43 related files,

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:43.546 position:27% line:83% align:start
I came across a
lot of weird stuff

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:46.482 position:10% line:83% align:start
in the testimonies of those
who knew the man back then.

00:29:46.516 --> 00:29:49.352 position:13% line:83% align:start
I noticed a definite trend
of admiration for Nanao.

00:29:49.385 --> 00:29:52.154 position:10% line:83% align:start
And I suspect this trend may
be the result of a forced

00:29:52.188 --> 00:29:54.290 position:7% line:5% align:start
language recognition program.

00:29:54.323 --> 00:29:57.327 position:16% line:83% align:start
These records have been
clearly manufactured--

00:29:57.361 --> 00:29:59.863 position:19% line:83% align:start
or rather, skillfully
overwritten.

00:29:59.896 --> 00:30:02.699 position:13% line:83% align:start
The cyber cops would never
have seen through these.

00:30:02.733 --> 00:30:04.635 position:30% line:83% align:start
Hell, not even
Special Investigations

00:30:04.668 --> 00:30:06.637 position:16% line:83% align:start
were able to tell these
were altered documents.

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:09.239 position:21% line:83% align:start
This falsifying was
a quality forge job.

00:30:09.272 --> 00:30:10.674 position:30% line:89% align:start
-Superb work.

00:30:10.707 --> 00:30:11.742 position:21% line:89% align:start
Batou, do it quick.

00:30:11.775 --> 00:30:12.909 position:27% line:89% align:start
Apprehend Nanao.

00:30:12.943 --> 00:30:14.711 position:30% line:89% align:start
BATOU: Roger.

00:30:14.745 --> 00:30:17.914 position:5% line:83% align:start
ARAMAKI: There's a lot more to
this case than I ever imagined.

00:30:17.948 --> 00:30:19.650 position:19% line:89% align:start
KUSANAGI: Saito, Pazu.

00:30:19.683 --> 00:30:21.885 position:19% line:83% align:start
Is the police jamming
barrier causing

00:30:21.919 --> 00:30:23.955 position:5% line:83% align:start
interference in our connection?
SAITO: No.

00:30:23.988 --> 00:30:25.589 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're loud and clear.

00:30:25.622 --> 00:30:27.324 position:27% line:83% align:start
PAZU: Same here.
KUSANAGI: Really?

00:30:27.357 --> 00:30:28.458 position:21% line:89% align:start
MAN: Routine check.

00:30:28.492 --> 00:30:31.194 position:16% line:83% align:start
All personnel move from
security level beta to charlie.

00:30:31.228 --> 00:30:39.436 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Hey!

00:30:39.469 --> 00:30:40.705 position:16% line:83% align:start
Who are you people with?
BATOU: Move.

00:30:40.738 --> 00:30:41.471 position:27% line:89% align:start
Public security.

00:30:41.505 --> 00:30:45.342 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Stop!

00:30:49.714 --> 00:30:51.482 position:27% line:83% align:start
BATOU: Nanao Ei,
you're under arrest

00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:55.520 position:16% line:83% align:start
for threatening to kill
the superintendent general.

00:30:55.553 --> 00:30:57.755 position:13% line:83% align:start
-What the hell does public
security want with--

00:30:57.789 --> 00:31:04.829 position:33% line:89% align:start
BATOU: Shh.

00:31:04.862 --> 00:31:07.498 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
What's going on?

00:31:10.401 --> 00:31:12.737 position:24% line:83% align:start
-I was never there
in the first place.

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:13.504 position:30% line:89% align:start
This is rich.

00:31:16.441 --> 00:31:17.875 position:10% line:83% align:start
Oh, I'm sure I'll be written
down in the history books

00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:20.578 position:16% line:89% align:start
now at the Laughing Man.

00:31:20.611 --> 00:31:22.613 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mwah.

00:31:22.647 --> 00:31:23.448 position:33% line:89% align:start
-That noise.

00:31:26.617 --> 00:31:27.719 position:38% line:89% align:start
-There.

00:31:27.752 --> 00:31:29.287 position:19% line:89% align:start
They're interceptors.

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.756 position:19% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: That static
in the routine checks

00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:32.657 position:30% line:83% align:start
was a modular
delayed action virus.

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:34.827 position:13% line:83% align:start
-He's been hearing through
the SIU's eyes all along.

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.461 position:27% line:89% align:start
KUSANAGI: Batou.

00:31:36.494 --> 00:31:39.430 position:19% line:83% align:start
Nanao is sending out a
modular virus via that room.

00:31:39.464 --> 00:31:40.999 position:24% line:83% align:start
BATOU: I'll trace
the source from here.

00:31:51.577 --> 00:31:53.479 position:24% line:83% align:start
MAN: Radio signal
violation of cyberbrain

code of ethics detected.

00:31:54.646 --> 00:31:55.848 position:16% line:89% align:start
Possible contamination.

00:31:55.881 --> 00:31:58.283 position:21% line:83% align:start
All personnel check
cyberbrain activity.

00:31:58.317 --> 00:31:59.718 position:30% line:83% align:start
Keep an eye on
people around you.

00:32:11.097 --> 00:32:14.433 position:35% line:89% align:start
[applause]

00:32:14.466 --> 00:32:23.542 position:27% line:89% align:start
-So it's begun.

00:32:23.575 --> 00:32:30.750 position:33% line:89% align:start
-Excuse me.

00:32:30.784 --> 00:32:34.520 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's a possibility of
cyberbrain contamination, sir.

00:32:34.553 --> 00:32:36.856 position:13% line:83% align:start
We'll run a check on the
cyberbrain activity of everyone

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:39.391 position:16% line:83% align:start
in the place, including
the security unit.

00:32:39.424 --> 00:32:39.993 position:33% line:89% align:start
Please, sir.

00:32:40.026 --> 00:32:41.460 position:19% line:89% align:start
Postpone your speech.

00:32:41.493 --> 00:32:43.328 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Mmhm.

00:32:43.362 --> 00:32:45.364 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Until we identify
those infected,

00:32:45.397 --> 00:32:47.901 position:24% line:83% align:start
all personnel will
stand ready on F2 alert.

00:32:47.934 --> 00:32:50.369 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Hey, who are you?
Hold it.

00:32:50.403 --> 00:32:51.871 position:13% line:89% align:start
State your name and rank.

00:32:51.905 --> 00:32:52.672 position:27% line:89% align:start
-Now, listen up.

00:32:52.705 --> 00:32:54.841 position:24% line:83% align:start
All you people on
security detail

00:32:54.874 --> 00:32:58.011 position:13% line:83% align:start
are the ones who are most
likely to exhibit any symptoms.

00:32:58.044 --> 00:33:00.613 position:13% line:83% align:start
And considering that your
routine check transmissions

00:33:00.647 --> 00:33:02.982 position:27% line:83% align:start
carry a delayed
action virus, it'll

00:33:03.016 --> 00:33:05.018 position:19% line:83% align:start
either infect just the
command classic equipped

00:33:05.051 --> 00:33:07.754 position:7% line:83% align:start
with an encryption conversion
key or everyone else.

00:33:16.696 --> 00:33:17.864 position:44% line:89% align:start
-Go.

00:33:17.897 --> 00:33:20.800 position:41% line:83% align:start
Right!
-Is that him?

00:33:20.834 --> 00:33:27.407 position:33% line:89% align:start
-Stop them.

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.776 position:16% line:83% align:start
Don't let them near the
superintendent general.

00:33:28.809 --> 00:33:38.152 position:16% line:83% align:start
Everyone else, form a--
Now, the purge will begin!

00:33:38.185 --> 00:33:39.385 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Huh?

00:33:54.134 --> 00:33:56.704 position:7% line:83% align:start
-This is an excellent training
exercise for your men.

00:33:56.737 --> 00:33:58.839 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you don't want to live
out your golden years

00:33:58.873 --> 00:34:00.841 position:10% line:83% align:start
in the intensive care unit,
then I suggest you stay put.

00:34:19.961 --> 00:34:21.729 position:10% line:89% align:start
Now, that's a reality show.

00:34:36.912 --> 00:34:41.216 position:16% line:83% align:start
Dammit, someone's trying
to copy the virus online.

00:34:41.249 --> 00:34:44.119 position:24% line:89% align:start
An attack barrier.

00:34:44.152 --> 00:34:45.754 position:38% line:89% align:start
-Major.

00:34:45.787 --> 00:34:46.888 position:27% line:89% align:start
That was close.

00:34:46.922 --> 00:34:50.091 position:16% line:83% align:start
Going in through a dummy
barrier was a fortunate move.

00:34:50.125 --> 00:34:51.693 position:10% line:89% align:start
-Was it a booby trap virus?

00:34:51.726 --> 00:34:54.062 position:35% line:89% align:start
-Not sure.

00:34:54.095 --> 00:34:55.597 position:24% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: Who the
hell was snooping

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:57.098 position:5% line:89% align:start
around inside this man's brain?

00:34:57.132 --> 00:34:58.133 position:24% line:89% align:start
BATOU: It's open.

00:35:14.783 --> 00:35:15.684 position:21% line:89% align:start
TOGUSA: He got away?

00:35:39.308 --> 00:35:42.578 position:13% line:89% align:start
-Point blank, one bullet.

00:35:42.611 --> 00:35:45.648 position:7% line:89% align:start
Our guy uses a silencer, too.

00:35:45.681 --> 00:35:47.016 position:13% line:89% align:start
-What the hell's going on?

00:35:47.049 --> 00:35:49.251 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wasn't the whole idea
to have the SIU collar

00:35:49.285 --> 00:35:50.820 position:27% line:83% align:start
this guy so they
could drop the curtain

00:35:50.853 --> 00:35:52.822 position:13% line:89% align:start
on the Laughing Man case?

00:35:52.855 --> 00:35:56.125 position:21% line:89% align:start
-Hey, don't ask me.

00:35:56.158 --> 00:35:59.128 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's sort of like cutting
a tail off a lizard.

00:35:59.161 --> 00:36:00.563 position:24% line:89% align:start
A new perp appear.

00:36:00.596 --> 00:36:04.134 position:16% line:89% align:start
-I know, but-- his face.

00:36:04.167 --> 00:36:06.602 position:33% line:89% align:start
BATOU: Yeah.

00:36:06.635 --> 00:36:09.605 position:7% line:89% align:start
The son of a bitch is smiling.

00:36:09.638 --> 00:36:12.575 position:19% line:89% align:start
-Nanao's been killed?

00:36:12.608 --> 00:36:14.710 position:16% line:89% align:start
They got the drop on us.

00:36:14.744 --> 00:36:15.912 position:24% line:83% align:start
Scope out as much
of the crime scene

00:36:15.946 --> 00:36:18.781 position:10% line:83% align:start
as you can, then clear out
before the SIU gets over there.

00:36:18.814 --> 00:36:21.284 position:16% line:89% align:start
Dead men tell no tales.

00:36:21.318 --> 00:36:23.153 position:38% line:89% align:start
-Roger.

00:36:23.186 --> 00:36:25.789 position:21% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: Chief, I'm
sending a copy of the virus

00:36:25.822 --> 00:36:27.924 position:7% line:89% align:start
that we believe Nanao planted.

00:36:27.958 --> 00:36:29.826 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's only shown up in a
commander with a encryption

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:31.962 position:27% line:83% align:start
conversion key,
so I doubt anyone

00:36:31.995 --> 00:36:33.764 position:10% line:89% align:start
else will exhibit symptoms.

00:36:33.797 --> 00:36:36.733 position:24% line:83% align:start
But better make a
vaccine just to be safe.

00:36:36.767 --> 00:36:37.434 position:33% line:89% align:start
-All right.

00:36:37.467 --> 00:36:38.769 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'll have it made up at once.

00:36:41.204 --> 00:36:42.806 position:24% line:89% align:start
[press clamoring]

00:36:42.839 --> 00:36:44.207 position:33% line:89% align:start
-Stand back!

00:36:44.241 --> 00:36:45.909 position:19% line:89% align:start
Please, clear the way.

00:36:45.942 --> 00:36:46.843 position:33% line:89% align:start
Stand back!

00:36:49.679 --> 00:36:50.914 position:5% line:89% align:start
KUSANAGI: Get that vaccine ASAP.

00:36:50.947 --> 00:36:52.649 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm getting a bad vibe here.

00:36:52.682 --> 00:36:54.918 position:30% line:83% align:start
Pazu, tail the
superintendent general again.

00:36:54.951 --> 00:36:55.752 position:33% line:89% align:start
PAZU: Roger.

watch the perimeter.

00:36:58.189 --> 00:37:01.024 position:35% line:89% align:start

I will kill the superintendent.

00:40:25.266 --> 00:40:27.368 position:10% line:89% align:start
you already have the answer?

I am the Laughing Man.

It was sent to me
from the Laughing Man.

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:45.319 position:24% line:83% align:start
In that threat of
assassination, it

00:40:45.353 --> 00:40:48.188 position:19% line:83% align:start
told me that I was to
become the Laughing Man.

00:40:48.222 --> 00:40:50.124 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I don't recall
there being any mention

00:40:50.157 --> 00:40:53.528 position:21% line:83% align:start
of assassinating the

00:41:04.272 --> 00:41:06.975 position:21% line:83% align:start
about those-- those
people who were-- you

00:41:07.008 --> 00:41:10.211 position:19% line:83% align:start
could refer to them as
copycats, I suppose.

00:41:10.245 --> 00:41:13.081 position:24% line:83% align:start
Who or what do you
think they were?

00:41:13.114 --> 00:41:15.283 position:16% line:83% align:start
Three called themselves
the Laughing Man.

00:41:15.317 --> 00:41:17.218 position:27% line:83% align:start
Two confessed to
committing the crime out

00:41:17.252 --> 00:41:18.853 position:19% line:89% align:start
of admiration for him.

00:41:18.887 --> 00:41:20.388 position:24% line:83% align:start
Three others said
that the threat

00:41:20.422 --> 00:41:23.358 position:7% line:89% align:start
came to them as a revelation.

00:41:23.391 --> 00:41:26.995 position:5% line:83% align:start
In addition to those people, we
rounded up another 39 Laughing

those who were arrested

00:41:29.665 --> 00:41:33.602 position:16% line:83% align:start
for suspicious behavior
along the perimeter.

00:41:33.636 --> 00:41:35.236 position:24% line:83% align:start
Plus, none of them
acted together.

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:38.273 position:16% line:83% align:start
And there's no religious
connection, either.

00:41:38.306 --> 00:41:41.076 position:10% line:83% align:start
All these upstanding people
who couldn't possibly

00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:43.178 position:27% line:83% align:start
be linked to the
Laughing Man crimes,

00:41:43.211 --> 00:41:46.214 position:13% line:83% align:start
with no trace of external
manipulation by a virus

00:41:46.247 --> 00:41:49.984 position:16% line:83% align:start
or brainwashing device,
committed an act of terrorism

00:41:50.018 --> 00:41:53.021 position:13% line:83% align:start
simply because they saw a
warning on TV insinuating

00:41:53.054 --> 00:41:55.056 position:16% line:83% align:start
that the superintendent
general would be assassinated.

00:41:58.227 --> 00:42:00.929 position:13% line:83% align:start
Can you tell me how anyone
would begin to explain that?

00:42:04.033 --> 00:42:05.334 position:35% line:89% align:start
-Explain?

00:42:05.368 --> 00:42:07.436 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, in a play,
even the audience

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:11.107 position:7% line:89% align:start
is a part of the performance.

00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:14.276 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Sorry, but that's
not much of an answer.

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:18.080 position:10% line:83% align:start
Like you said once before--
and I do agree with you now

00:42:18.114 --> 00:42:19.682 position:27% line:83% align:start
that there was a
police cover up using

00:42:19.715 --> 00:42:21.917 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nanao Ei as an unwitting decoy.

00:42:21.951 --> 00:42:24.120 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I can't ignore the
feeling that there's

00:42:24.153 --> 00:42:26.222 position:19% line:83% align:start
an entirely different
story behind the madness

00:42:26.255 --> 00:42:29.125 position:7% line:89% align:start
brought out by the imitators.

00:42:29.158 --> 00:42:30.627 position:24% line:83% align:start
Everything's being
tinted the same shade.

00:42:41.571 --> 00:42:42.539 position:38% line:89% align:start
-Major?

00:42:42.572 --> 00:42:44.073 position:33% line:89% align:start

00:42:44.106 --> 00:42:47.544 position:16% line:83% align:start

a vocational aid center.

-The database of the Ministry
of Health and Welfare

00:43:01.258 --> 00:43:02.726 position:7% line:89% align:start
was hacked into the last week.

00:43:02.759 --> 00:43:05.562 position:5% line:89% align:start
It was a large scale inside job.

00:43:05.595 --> 00:43:08.632 position:19% line:83% align:start
The leaked information
included material

00:43:08.665 --> 00:43:12.202 position:19% line:83% align:start
it was classified even
higher than A level.

00:43:12.235 --> 00:43:15.372 position:10% line:83% align:start
Notice the amount of time it
took to crack the barrier.

00:43:15.405 --> 00:43:18.074 position:10% line:83% align:start
They breached a triple layer
of varied attack barriers

00:43:18.108 --> 00:43:19.242 position:24% line:89% align:start
in just two hours.

better than the major.

-Better than her?

00:43:25.215 --> 00:43:28.285 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Borma and Ishikawa did
a thorough route trace,

00:43:28.318 --> 00:43:31.321 position:19% line:83% align:start
and that building is
definitely the point of origin.

00:43:31.354 --> 00:43:33.423 position:21% line:83% align:start
However, the strange
thing is the circuits

00:43:33.457 --> 00:43:35.726 position:24% line:83% align:start
at the center are
normally kept isolated.

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.495 position:24% line:83% align:start

virtually impossible

from the inside and vice versa.

00:43:42.032 --> 00:43:43.568 position:16% line:83% align:start
-What's even more odd is
the Ministry of Health

00:43:43.601 --> 00:43:45.436 position:16% line:89% align:start
and Welfare's reaction.

00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:48.272 position:16% line:83% align:start
Someone's accessed their
highly classified data,

Even if they were

00:43:52.643 --> 00:43:55.112 position:24% line:83% align:start
their response is
very unnatural.

don't want us to know about.

00:43:58.416 --> 00:44:01.052 position:7% line:83% align:start

00:45:52.799 --> 00:45:56.235 position:5% line:83% align:start
We make use of the peculiarities
of their condition in their job

00:45:56.269 --> 00:46:00.506 position:13% line:83% align:start
training by having these
children program barrier mazes.

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:03.509 position:21% line:83% align:start
Occasionally, these
activities result in a barrier

00:46:03.543 --> 00:46:06.713 position:24% line:83% align:start
so remarkable that
government agencies adopt it.

00:46:06.746 --> 00:46:07.881 position:30% line:83% align:start
Each and every
one is constructed

00:46:07.915 --> 00:46:10.683 position:13% line:89% align:start
in a truly unique fashion.

00:46:10.717 --> 00:46:14.320 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm certain if we were to leave
them alone, they would go on,

00:46:14.354 --> 00:46:16.824 position:19% line:83% align:start
never stopping, never
bored, assembling

00:46:16.857 --> 00:46:17.624 position:13% line:89% align:start
and dismantling barriers.

00:46:29.937 --> 00:46:31.839 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll put you in
charge of a relatively

00:46:31.872 --> 00:46:34.408 position:5% line:89% align:start
manageable single group for now.

00:46:34.441 --> 00:46:36.810 position:21% line:89% align:start
Togusa, this is Aoi.

00:46:36.844 --> 00:46:38.412 position:13% line:89% align:start
He's one of your charges.

00:46:38.445 --> 00:46:39.546 position:38% line:89% align:start
-Right.

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:41.280 position:7% line:83% align:start
-I believe the other children
are back in their room,

00:46:41.315 --> 00:46:43.350 position:13% line:89% align:start
so take him to join them.

00:46:43.384 --> 00:46:44.284 position:33% line:89% align:start
-Yes, ma'am.

00:46:49.723 --> 00:46:50.858 position:33% line:89% align:start
-Aoi, right?

00:46:50.891 --> 00:46:51.792 position:27% line:89% align:start
Nice to meet ya.

00:47:05.472 --> 00:47:06.774 position:30% line:89% align:start
-Christ, Aoi.

00:47:06.807 --> 00:47:08.509 position:24% line:89% align:start
What took you so--

00:47:08.542 --> 00:47:09.410 position:44% line:89% align:start
-Hi.

00:47:09.443 --> 00:47:10.377 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm Togusa.

00:47:10.411 --> 00:47:13.681 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm taking over today.

00:47:13.714 --> 00:47:14.415 position:21% line:89% align:start
How you doing there?

00:47:23.825 --> 00:47:24.993 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hey, you want to
play a game of catch?

00:47:25.026 --> 00:47:25.694 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Hey!

00:47:25.727 --> 00:47:26.828 position:30% line:89% align:start
Give it back!

00:47:26.861 --> 00:47:28.262 position:13% line:89% align:start
-He's getting freaked out.

00:47:28.295 --> 00:47:32.634 position:44% line:89% align:start
-Oh.

00:47:40.775 --> 00:47:44.312 position:7% line:83% align:start
-He-- he goes into panic mode
when he doesn't have his mitt.

00:47:44.345 --> 00:47:46.881 position:27% line:83% align:start
Besides, nobody
wants to go outside.

00:47:46.915 --> 00:47:52.787 position:33% line:89% align:start
Not anymore.

00:47:52.821 --> 00:47:56.491 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Hey, the chief swears
he's gonna come again!

00:47:56.524 --> 00:47:57.093 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Huh?

00:47:57.126 --> 00:47:58.927 position:30% line:83% align:start
-You mean it?
-Mmhm.

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.462 position:13% line:89% align:start
I heard about it just now.

00:48:00.495 --> 00:48:01.429 position:38% line:89% align:start
-No way!

00:48:01.463 --> 00:48:02.932 position:10% line:89% align:start
He was here just last week.

00:48:02.965 --> 00:48:05.868 position:33% line:89% align:start
-Last week?

00:48:05.901 --> 00:48:07.736 position:16% line:89% align:start
So who's this chief guy?

00:48:07.769 --> 00:48:10.371 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Hey, pretty slick
of you, mister.

00:48:10.405 --> 00:48:11.740 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Shh.

00:48:11.774 --> 00:48:13.541 position:30% line:89% align:start
-What's wrong?

00:48:13.575 --> 00:48:15.978 position:16% line:83% align:start
-We don't trust grownups
around here, especially ones

00:48:16.011 --> 00:48:17.813 position:24% line:89% align:start
we don't know yet.

00:48:17.847 --> 00:48:19.581 position:30% line:89% align:start
BOY: Oh, yeah.

00:48:19.615 --> 00:48:22.383 position:7% line:83% align:start
BOY: So don't think that we'll
just blab everything to you.

00:48:22.417 --> 00:48:23.719 position:19% line:89% align:start
-That's pretty strict.

00:48:23.753 --> 00:48:24.920 position:27% line:89% align:start
-We have to be.

00:48:24.954 --> 00:48:27.656 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Hey, I'm gonna go
tell the others, OK?

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:34.362 position:33% line:89% align:start
-Yeah, sure.

00:48:34.396 --> 00:48:35.164 position:35% line:89% align:start
-Comrades!

00:48:35.197 --> 00:48:37.366 position:27% line:83% align:start
Word has it that
starting tomorrow,

00:48:37.399 --> 00:48:40.536 position:7% line:83% align:start
we'll be going back to the lab
to participate in simulations.

00:48:40.569 --> 00:48:41.504 position:24% line:89% align:start
-Oh, simulations!

00:48:41.537 --> 00:48:46.475 position:33% line:89% align:start
[chattering]

00:48:46.509 --> 00:48:49.645 position:21% line:83% align:start
-They say that what
we've acquired in secret

00:48:49.678 --> 00:48:54.650 position:10% line:83% align:start
might help the investigation
of the Laughing Man case.

00:48:54.683 --> 00:48:57.953 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Does this have to do with the
natural oil we used to get?

00:48:57.988 --> 00:48:59.222 position:13% line:89% align:start
-I don't know about that.

00:48:59.256 --> 00:49:02.959 position:5% line:83% align:start
But the day has finally arrived
when we can contribute mentally

00:49:02.993 --> 00:49:05.461 position:19% line:83% align:start
as well as physically
to Section 9.

00:49:05.494 --> 00:49:07.496 position:13% line:89% align:start
-That's a huge promotion.

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:09.732 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Uh, what is it we're supposed
to have acquired again?

00:49:09.766 --> 00:49:11.400 position:27% line:89% align:start
-Individuality!

00:49:11.433 --> 00:49:13.837 position:24% line:83% align:start
Little by little,
our AIs have begun

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:15.638 position:19% line:83% align:start
to develop individual
differences.

00:49:15.672 --> 00:49:16.873 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Yeah.

00:49:16.907 --> 00:49:18.909 position:13% line:83% align:start
Even though we synchronize
our data after every mission.

00:49:18.942 --> 00:49:20.043 position:33% line:89% align:start
-Weird, huh?

00:49:20.076 --> 00:49:21.477 position:24% line:83% align:start
-It's the opposite
of what happened

00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:23.713 position:21% line:83% align:start
with those Laughing
Man copycats.

00:49:23.747 --> 00:49:26.983 position:16% line:83% align:start
-But it's also possible
they'll just have us scrapped.

00:49:27.017 --> 00:49:28.118 position:41% line:89% align:start
-What?

00:49:28.151 --> 00:49:29.986 position:10% line:89% align:start
-What's with the negativity?

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:32.823 position:19% line:83% align:start
-If there are new jobs
waiting for us at the lab,

00:49:32.856 --> 00:49:33.723 position:24% line:83% align:start
then doesn't that
mean we've been

00:49:33.757 --> 00:49:35.859 position:24% line:83% align:start
declared unfit for
our current duties?

00:49:35.892 --> 00:49:38.728 position:10% line:83% align:start
Though I still like the idea
of us contributing mentally.

00:49:38.762 --> 00:49:41.398 position:24% line:83% align:start
To take an extreme
theoretical example,

00:49:41.431 --> 00:49:42.566 position:21% line:83% align:start
it's not beyond the
realm of possibility

00:49:42.599 --> 00:49:45.635 position:10% line:83% align:start
that a mass of data with no
body could carry a ghost.

00:49:45.669 --> 00:49:46.603 position:27% line:89% align:start
TACHIKOMA: Whoa.

00:49:46.636 --> 00:49:47.637 position:19% line:89% align:start
You came up with that?

00:49:47.671 --> 00:49:49.906 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm impressed.

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:51.775 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why don't you join
their conversation?

00:49:51.808 --> 00:49:54.544 position:16% line:83% align:start
-No, I'm more interested
in books lately.

00:49:54.578 --> 00:49:57.914 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Really?
What you reading?

00:49:57.949 --> 00:50:00.117 position:16% line:89% align:start
-"Flowers For Algernon."

00:50:00.151 --> 00:50:01.518 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Wow, you're going
to the trouble

00:50:01.551 --> 00:50:02.920 position:7% line:89% align:start
of reading it on paper medium?

00:50:02.954 --> 00:50:06.090 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Whether it's a mere job
rotation or impending

00:50:06.123 --> 00:50:09.026 position:10% line:83% align:start
destruction, I don't want to
forget my love of reading.

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.965 position:24% line:89% align:start
BATOU: Tachikoma.

00:50:13.998 --> 00:50:16.167 position:27% line:89% align:start
-Oh, Mr. Batou.

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.500 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Why don't you come
with me for a while

00:50:17.534 --> 00:50:19.136 position:24% line:83% align:start
and give me a hand
doing some target

00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:21.138 position:10% line:89% align:start
practice with the trainees?

00:50:21.172 --> 00:50:24.508 position:38% line:89% align:start
-Coming!

00:50:24.542 --> 00:50:26.043 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Now, what were you
guys talking about?

00:50:26.077 --> 00:50:28.411 position:30% line:89% align:start
-Oh, nothing.

00:50:28.446 --> 00:50:30.681 position:16% line:83% align:start
Anyway, what am I gonna
do with you now, Batou?

00:50:30.715 --> 00:50:34.051 position:16% line:83% align:start
You can't handle target
practice without me.

00:50:34.085 --> 00:50:35.086 position:21% line:89% align:start
BATOU: I guess not.

00:50:35.119 --> 00:50:37.889 position:7% line:89% align:start
-Why does he always get to go?

00:50:37.922 --> 00:50:39.657 position:10% line:83% align:start
TACHIKOMA: Maybe we need to
find out the real reason why

00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:41.626 position:21% line:83% align:start
the Major is sending
us back to the lab.

00:50:51.602 --> 00:50:52.837 position:33% line:89% align:start
-What's up?

00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:55.940 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why'd you want me
to meet you here?

00:50:55.974 --> 00:50:59.644 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm guessing it's not to confess
your burning passion for me.

00:50:59.677 --> 00:51:01.213 position:21% line:83% align:start
-It's the only room
in the building that's

00:51:01.246 --> 00:51:03.882 position:10% line:83% align:start
electromagnetically shielded
so we can have some privacy.

00:51:10.956 --> 00:51:13.225 position:10% line:89% align:start
-Pass that dossier to Batou.

00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:20.132 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Just glance through
it, all right?

00:51:20.165 --> 00:51:22.200 position:33% line:89% align:start
You spot it?

00:51:22.234 --> 00:51:23.602 position:10% line:89% align:start
KUSANAGI: Don't turnaround.

00:51:23.635 --> 00:51:25.203 position:30% line:83% align:start
But there's a
camouflaged Tachikoma

00:51:25.237 --> 00:51:26.638 position:27% line:83% align:start
hanging from the
corridor ceiling.

00:51:33.211 --> 00:51:34.513 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's reading our lips.

00:51:34.546 --> 00:51:36.615 position:10% line:89% align:start
Pretend you haven't noticed.

00:51:36.648 --> 00:51:38.750 position:19% line:83% align:start
We'll physically speak
about something else

00:51:38.784 --> 00:51:40.986 position:21% line:83% align:start
while we're talking
via encrypted cybercom.

00:51:41.019 --> 00:51:42.487 position:19% line:89% align:start
BATOU: What the hell?

00:51:42.521 --> 00:51:43.855 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why go through all this trouble?

00:51:46.692 --> 00:51:48.660 position:10% line:89% align:start
TACHIKOMA: Now, what's this?

00:51:48.694 --> 00:51:50.562 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, to make a
long story short,

00:51:50.595 --> 00:51:51.830 position:27% line:83% align:start
judging from the
end results, there

00:51:51.863 --> 00:51:54.633 position:13% line:83% align:start
are major issues regarding
your qualifications

00:51:54.666 --> 00:51:56.635 position:13% line:89% align:start
as a training instructor.

00:51:56.668 --> 00:51:58.071 position:16% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: Well, to make
a long story short,

00:51:58.104 --> 00:52:00.539 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have a serious issue
with the similarities

00:52:00.572 --> 00:52:02.141 position:33% line:83% align:start
between the
Tachikomas' development

00:52:02.175 --> 00:52:03.843 position:13% line:89% align:start
and the Laughing Man case.

00:52:03.876 --> 00:52:06.179 position:16% line:83% align:start
Their formation of egos,
which should be impossible,

00:52:06.212 --> 00:52:08.714 position:27% line:83% align:start
and the loss of
individuality-- at first, these

00:52:08.748 --> 00:52:10.783 position:35% line:83% align:start
seem to be
contradictory problems,

00:52:10.817 --> 00:52:12.719 position:21% line:83% align:start
but we need to keep
a close eye on them

00:52:12.752 --> 00:52:16.689 position:7% line:83% align:start
as unintended consequences of
information synchronization.

00:52:16.723 --> 00:52:18.791 position:7% line:83% align:start
BATOU: Hey, I don't feed them
natural oil on the sly anymore.

00:52:18.825 --> 00:52:21.160 position:13% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: No one suspects
you of doing that.

00:52:21.194 --> 00:52:22.161 position:24% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't have a
problem with this

00:52:22.195 --> 00:52:24.931 position:16% line:83% align:start
if it had happened in a
lab, but for a weapon,

00:52:24.964 --> 00:52:25.631 position:21% line:89% align:start
it could be lethal.

00:52:28.768 --> 00:52:31.604 position:5% line:83% align:start
TACHIKOMA: Hey, I'm not beating
them up on the sly anymore.

00:52:31.637 --> 00:52:33.906 position:27% line:83% align:start
No one suspects
you of doing that.

00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:35.108 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:52:35.141 --> 00:52:37.944 position:10% line:83% align:start
It doesn't look like they're
talking about us after all.

00:52:37.977 --> 00:52:39.313 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Don't we still have
the option of doing

00:52:39.346 --> 00:52:42.548 position:19% line:83% align:start
a full initialization
of their AI?

00:52:42.582 --> 00:52:46.019 position:13% line:83% align:start
-We tried that, but we got
the exact same results.

00:52:46.052 --> 00:52:50.690 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, but all Tachikoma
use is suspended as of today.

00:52:50.723 --> 00:52:52.859 position:16% line:83% align:start
On the brighter side, it
looks like their AI will

00:52:52.892 --> 00:52:57.031 position:5% line:83% align:start
be useful in running simulations
on the Laughing Man copycats.

00:52:57.064 --> 00:52:59.266 position:16% line:83% align:start
They won't be told, but
after they've been disarmed,

00:52:59.299 --> 00:53:00.934 position:19% line:83% align:start
we'll send them to the
test lab, where they'll

00:53:00.968 --> 00:53:03.569 position:30% line:83% align:start
assist us with
our investigation.

00:53:03.603 --> 00:53:04.604 position:30% line:89% align:start
Is that clear?

00:53:09.076 --> 00:53:12.046 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Are you giving me an
order as my superior?

00:53:12.079 --> 00:53:14.048 position:27% line:89% align:start
KUSANAGI: I am.

00:53:14.081 --> 00:53:17.051 position:16% line:83% align:start
-I don't have the luxury
of refusing, do I?

00:53:17.084 --> 00:53:20.054 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'll comply.

00:53:20.087 --> 00:53:21.188 position:30% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: It's
time to reestablish

00:53:21.221 --> 00:53:22.623 position:21% line:89% align:start
contact with Togusa.

00:53:22.656 --> 00:53:24.758 position:24% line:83% align:start
We'll go there the
old-fashioned way.

00:53:24.792 --> 00:53:25.759 position:33% line:89% align:start
BATOU: What?

00:53:25.793 --> 00:53:28.095 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't even have time
to say goodbye to them?

00:53:28.128 --> 00:53:30.164 position:30% line:83% align:start
TOGUSA: Sorry.
But I'm afraid not.

00:53:38.205 --> 00:53:41.075 position:5% line:83% align:start
TOGUSA: If somebody is using the
barriers created by these kids,

00:53:41.108 --> 00:53:43.710 position:13% line:83% align:start
it might explain why that
hacking of the Ministry

00:53:43.744 --> 00:53:46.281 position:19% line:83% align:start
of Health and Welfare
was so skillful.

00:53:46.314 --> 00:53:47.714 position:38% line:89% align:start
-I see.

00:53:47.748 --> 00:53:49.683 position:21% line:83% align:start
Any suspects so far?
TOGUSA: No.

00:53:49.716 --> 00:53:52.753 position:38% line:83% align:start
Not yet.
But this is one weird operation.

00:53:52.786 --> 00:53:54.389 position:27% line:83% align:start
They've even got
a heavy load-out

00:53:54.422 --> 00:53:56.224 position:13% line:89% align:start
cyborg stalking the halls.

00:53:56.257 --> 00:53:57.624 position:33% line:89% align:start
-Copy that.

00:53:57.658 --> 00:53:59.027 position:30% line:83% align:start
Carry on your
investigation for now.

00:53:59.060 --> 00:53:59.726 position:30% line:89% align:start
TOGUSA: Roger.

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:02.263 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:54:07.869 --> 00:54:10.805 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, somebody besides me
has been using this, huh?

00:54:14.342 --> 00:54:17.378 position:24% line:83% align:start
I thought what I'd
do was I'd pretend

00:54:17.412 --> 00:54:23.751 position:24% line:83% align:start
I was one of those
deaf-mutes, or should I?

00:54:23.785 --> 00:54:24.686 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the hell?

00:54:31.159 --> 00:54:31.893 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oil paint.

00:54:36.965 --> 00:54:38.867 position:13% line:83% align:start
-You're in charge for now.
-Right.

00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:42.204 position:35% line:89% align:start
-It's you.

00:54:42.238 --> 00:54:43.272 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hello.

00:54:43.305 --> 00:54:46.175 position:27% line:89% align:start
-Good afternoon.

00:54:46.208 --> 00:54:47.276 position:24% line:89% align:start
Going out, ma'am?

00:54:47.309 --> 00:54:48.710 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Yes.

00:54:48.743 --> 00:54:50.246 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's a welfare
industry gathering.

00:54:50.279 --> 00:54:51.779 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Oh, really?
Have fun.

00:55:07.296 --> 00:55:09.365 position:35% line:89% align:start
Wait here.

00:55:09.398 --> 00:55:11.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
Sorry about this, but I'll
be done in a minute, OK?

00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:17.106 position:44% line:83% align:start
Hm.
Huh?

00:55:25.415 --> 00:55:27.783 position:30% line:83% align:start
No suspicious
records to speak of,

00:55:27.816 --> 00:55:29.985 position:24% line:83% align:start
and zero visitors
last week, huh?

00:55:34.424 --> 00:55:35.925 position:38% line:89% align:start
Dammit.

00:55:35.958 --> 00:55:37.494 position:24% line:83% align:start
Not being able to
access external memory

00:55:37.527 --> 00:55:38.261 position:21% line:89% align:start
is a friggin' pain.

00:55:43.133 --> 00:55:46.203 position:19% line:89% align:start
WOMAN: Dear, oh, dear.

00:55:46.236 --> 00:55:50.806 position:10% line:83% align:start
You've abandoned your charge
to do a bit of spying?

00:55:50.839 --> 00:55:51.874 position:21% line:89% align:start
Search all you want.

00:55:51.907 --> 00:55:55.011 position:16% line:83% align:start
You won't find any clues
about the chief in there.

00:55:55.045 --> 00:55:57.214 position:19% line:83% align:start
-I guess you're in no
mood for excuses, right?

00:56:00.917 --> 00:56:02.485 position:24% line:83% align:start
-You can hurt him,
but don't kill him.

00:56:02.519 --> 00:56:03.420 position:33% line:89% align:start
-Yes, ma'am.

00:56:03.453 --> 00:56:06.022 position:21% line:89% align:start
-Now, wait a minute.

00:56:06.056 --> 00:56:09.025 position:21% line:83% align:start
If we fight in here,
your paintings could be--

00:56:09.059 --> 00:56:10.260 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Is that what you're
going to fight with?

00:56:10.293 --> 00:56:11.161 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Uh--

00:56:23.173 --> 00:56:26.042 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Painting shouldn't
be treated roughly.

00:56:32.283 --> 00:56:36.786 position:10% line:83% align:start
Unlike electronic data, they
can't be duplicated, dumbass.

00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:54.105 position:24% line:83% align:start
Didn't think I was
armed, did you?

00:57:25.169 --> 00:57:25.836 position:33% line:89% align:start
-Section 9.

00:57:34.078 --> 00:57:35.913 position:13% line:89% align:start
-Major, unusual activity.

00:57:35.946 --> 00:57:39.083 position:19% line:83% align:start
Every terminal in the
center just went online.

00:57:39.116 --> 00:57:42.487 position:19% line:89% align:start
-Something's happened.

00:57:42.521 --> 00:57:44.122 position:16% line:89% align:start
-It's our access codes.

00:57:44.156 --> 00:57:45.624 position:24% line:83% align:start
They're attempting
to decrypt them.

00:57:45.657 --> 00:57:47.292 position:19% line:89% align:start
-Was his cover blown?

00:57:47.326 --> 00:57:48.593 position:30% line:89% align:start
-I don't know.

00:57:48.627 --> 00:57:49.294 position:24% line:89% align:start
Cut all circuits.

00:57:49.328 --> 00:57:51.363 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hurry.

00:57:51.396 --> 00:57:52.597 position:21% line:89% align:start
What's the hold up?

00:57:52.631 --> 00:57:54.199 position:21% line:89% align:start
-I-- I'm locked out.

00:57:54.232 --> 00:57:57.469 position:33% line:89% align:start
-Batou, now!

00:57:57.502 --> 00:57:59.037 position:13% line:89% align:start
We're pulling Togusa out.

00:57:59.071 --> 00:58:00.072 position:44% line:89% align:start
-OK.

00:58:00.105 --> 00:58:02.007 position:21% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: Ishikawa,
commandeer their circuits.

00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:03.375 position:10% line:89% align:start
Seito, find the back route.

00:58:13.619 --> 00:58:14.554 position:35% line:89% align:start
-Got him!

00:58:14.587 --> 00:58:17.590 position:7% line:89% align:start
Man, did I fly that AI peeper.

00:58:17.623 --> 00:58:19.257 position:30% line:89% align:start
CHIEF: Garoha.

00:58:19.291 --> 00:58:20.258 position:27% line:89% align:start
-Hey, what's up?

00:58:20.292 --> 00:58:22.928 position:10% line:89% align:start
Where have you been, chief?

00:58:22.961 --> 00:58:24.129 position:7% line:89% align:start
CHIEF: Things have gotten bad.

00:58:24.162 --> 00:58:26.098 position:27% line:83% align:start
I was spotted by
people on the outside.

00:58:26.131 --> 00:58:29.201 position:27% line:83% align:start
A lot of adults
will be coming soon.

00:58:29.234 --> 00:58:32.305 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm disappearing before then.

00:58:32.338 --> 00:58:34.005 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Why?

00:58:34.039 --> 00:58:35.575 position:19% line:83% align:start
Till now, everything's
been going smoothly.

00:58:35.608 --> 00:58:38.311 position:24% line:83% align:start
We'll protect you,
Chief, same as always.

00:58:38.344 --> 00:58:39.178 position:44% line:89% align:start
-No.

00:58:39.212 --> 00:58:40.613 position:16% line:83% align:start
I appreciate everyone's
help, but it's

00:58:40.646 --> 00:58:42.215 position:16% line:89% align:start
time I left this place.

00:58:42.248 --> 00:58:43.116 position:24% line:89% align:start
KUSANAGI: Togusa!

00:59:04.337 --> 00:59:05.571 position:44% line:89% align:start
No!

00:59:05.605 --> 00:59:06.939 position:38% line:89% align:start
Togusa!

00:59:06.973 --> 00:59:08.975 position:10% line:83% align:start
What the hell happened here?
Come on.

00:59:09.008 --> 00:59:09.976 position:33% line:89% align:start
Talk to me.

00:59:10.009 --> 00:59:11.978 position:16% line:89% align:start
Dammit, Togusa, wake up!

00:59:12.011 --> 00:59:15.047 position:38% line:89% align:start
Togusa!

00:59:15.081 --> 00:59:16.449 position:27% line:83% align:start
So was there any
evidence to prove

00:59:16.483 --> 00:59:19.520 position:16% line:83% align:start
that this Aoi kid Togusa
mentioned ever existed?

00:59:19.553 --> 00:59:21.488 position:5% line:89% align:start
-I couldn't find a single trace.

00:59:21.522 --> 00:59:23.424 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's possible
someone deliberately

00:59:23.457 --> 00:59:26.993 position:7% line:83% align:start
altered the center's computer
files and the staff's memories.

00:59:27.026 --> 00:59:30.062 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I can't go too much further
using only Togusa's testimony.

00:59:30.096 --> 00:59:31.197 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Huh.

00:59:31.231 --> 00:59:34.201 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's why his report was
going to be a sketch, huh?

00:59:34.234 --> 00:59:36.370 position:24% line:83% align:start
-A handsome young
lad in a wheelchair

00:59:36.403 --> 00:59:38.505 position:10% line:89% align:start
with a lefty catcher's mitt.

00:59:38.539 --> 00:59:41.141 position:10% line:83% align:start
Togusa said he would use the
memories in his own cyberbrain

00:59:41.175 --> 00:59:43.009 position:33% line:83% align:start
to draw him.
-Wait.

00:59:43.043 --> 00:59:44.745 position:21% line:83% align:start
Did you say a lefty
catcher's mitt?

00:59:44.778 --> 00:59:46.547 position:16% line:89% align:start
That term is net jargon.

00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:49.683 position:7% line:83% align:start
It means something you think
is real when it actually isn't.

00:59:49.716 --> 00:59:51.752 position:10% line:89% align:start
TOGUSA: You sure about that?

00:59:51.785 --> 00:59:53.420 position:10% line:89% align:start
Sorry I took so long, Major.

00:59:53.454 --> 00:59:54.621 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Give.

00:59:54.655 --> 00:59:55.522 position:27% line:83% align:start
I want to see if
what you've got there

00:59:55.556 --> 00:59:58.158 position:24% line:83% align:start
is good enough to
save your sorry ass.

00:59:58.192 --> 01:00:00.027 position:16% line:89% align:start
-Now, don't be shocked.

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:00.728 position:13% line:89% align:start
This shows I have talent.

01:00:07.201 --> 01:00:10.170 position:16% line:89% align:start
-What the hell is this?

01:00:10.204 --> 01:00:13.006 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Looks like you picked up a
bad case of weird memories

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.141 position:24% line:89% align:start
in a weird place.

01:00:30.492 --> 01:00:32.494 position:21% line:83% align:start
TOGUSA: Just because
people didn't know me

01:00:32.527 --> 01:00:34.262 position:30% line:83% align:start
and because I
didn't know anybody,

01:00:34.295 --> 01:00:37.097 position:24% line:83% align:start
I thought what I'd
do is I'd pretend

01:00:37.131 --> 01:00:39.501 position:7% line:89% align:start
I was one of those deaf-mutes.

01:00:39.534 --> 01:00:41.569 position:24% line:83% align:start
I thought what I'd
do is I'd pretend

01:00:41.603 --> 01:00:45.206 position:7% line:89% align:start
I was one of those deaf-mutes.

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:50.745 position:21% line:83% align:start
What I'd do was I'd
pretend I-- or should I?

01:00:58.553 --> 01:00:59.254 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wait a minute.

01:01:06.227 --> 01:01:08.731 position:13% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: So I hear you're
pursing the Salinger angle.

01:01:08.764 --> 01:01:11.332 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Yes.

01:01:11.366 --> 01:01:12.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: It's well
known that he wrote

01:01:12.333 --> 01:01:15.169 position:19% line:83% align:start
a short story entitled
"The Laughing Man."

01:01:15.203 --> 01:01:17.205 position:16% line:83% align:start
And there's no shortage
of people who point out

01:01:17.238 --> 01:01:21.175 position:16% line:83% align:start
the similarities between
his story and the crimes.

01:01:21.209 --> 01:01:24.313 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thing is, Special Investigations
HQ has already analyzed

01:01:24.346 --> 01:01:27.416 position:30% line:83% align:start
every possible
interpretation of that story.

01:01:27.449 --> 01:01:29.218 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't think there's any
new take on the subject

01:01:29.251 --> 01:01:31.720 position:5% line:89% align:start
that's going to break the case.

01:01:31.754 --> 01:01:34.356 position:24% line:83% align:start
-But you've heard
art imitates life.

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:37.159 position:21% line:83% align:start
The opposite should
be true, too.

01:01:37.192 --> 01:01:40.529 position:13% line:83% align:start
You know, I can't help but
think that the boy I met,

01:01:40.563 --> 01:01:44.166 position:10% line:83% align:start
the one at the aids center,
was actually the Laughing Man.

01:01:44.199 --> 01:01:46.335 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Hey, there have been
countless suspects.

01:01:46.368 --> 01:01:48.571 position:16% line:83% align:start
They all seemed certain
to be the Laughing Man.

01:01:48.604 --> 01:01:50.372 position:21% line:83% align:start
So in light of that,
what basis do you

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:53.142 position:13% line:83% align:start
have for thinking this kid
is the genuine article?

01:01:53.175 --> 01:01:54.844 position:19% line:83% align:start
TOGUSA: Major, are you
familiar with the phrase

01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:57.881 position:16% line:83% align:start
around the Laughing Man
logo, and the meaning of it?

01:01:57.914 --> 01:01:59.682 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Yeah.

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:02.518 position:7% line:83% align:start
I thought what I'd do was I'd
become one of those deaf-mutes.

01:02:02.551 --> 01:02:04.320 position:30% line:89% align:start
I understand.

01:02:04.353 --> 01:02:07.389 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's a quote from chapter 25%
of "The Catcher in the Rye."

01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:08.592 position:38% line:89% align:start
-Uh-huh.

01:02:08.625 --> 01:02:10.259 position:21% line:83% align:start
And like I included
in my report,

01:02:10.292 --> 01:02:13.530 position:10% line:83% align:start
I saw some of it written on
that panel at the center.

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:16.900 position:7% line:83% align:start
At first, I convinced myself
it was verbatim from the novel.

01:02:16.933 --> 01:02:19.603 position:7% line:89% align:start
However, I realized something.

01:02:19.636 --> 01:02:22.606 position:10% line:83% align:start
The original quote ends with
"one of those deaf-mutes."

01:02:22.639 --> 01:02:25.675 position:7% line:89% align:start
But what I saw was different.

01:02:25.709 --> 01:02:27.277 position:30% line:89% align:start
"Or should I?"

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:31.348 position:5% line:89% align:start
This little bit had been added.

01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:32.882 position:24% line:83% align:start
You don't suppose
it's a conversation he

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:35.885 position:5% line:89% align:start
was having with himself, do you?

01:02:35.919 --> 01:02:37.921 position:21% line:83% align:start
Asking himself if he
should break his silence

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:40.523 position:5% line:89% align:start
and go back out into the world?

01:02:40.557 --> 01:02:41.491 position:13% line:89% align:start
Tell me something, Major.

01:02:41.524 --> 01:02:43.660 position:5% line:89% align:start
Have you ever experienced this?

01:02:43.693 --> 01:02:46.329 position:16% line:83% align:start
When you try to imitate
an artist you admire,

01:02:46.363 --> 01:02:49.232 position:10% line:83% align:start
you want to get as close as
you can to the original work.

01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:52.669 position:24% line:83% align:start
So you try to make
a perfect copy.

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:54.872 position:24% line:83% align:start
But here, we have
a boy who dared

01:02:54.905 --> 01:02:56.774 position:10% line:89% align:start
to modify Salinger's quote.

01:02:56.807 --> 01:02:58.441 position:30% line:83% align:start
He was able to
rewrite the end of it

01:02:58.475 --> 01:03:01.679 position:24% line:83% align:start
because this young
man was the original.

01:03:01.712 --> 01:03:03.380 position:27% line:83% align:start
-That theory is
awfully dependent

01:03:03.413 --> 01:03:05.382 position:16% line:89% align:start
on your personal views.

01:03:05.415 --> 01:03:08.284 position:5% line:83% align:start
You do realize it's far too weak
for you to base anything on,

01:03:08.318 --> 01:03:09.352 position:35% line:89% align:start
don't you?

01:03:09.386 --> 01:03:11.489 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Regardless of his cutting
edge hacking techniques,

01:03:11.522 --> 01:03:15.526 position:7% line:83% align:start
the Laughing Man kidnapped CEO
Serano, at gunpoint no less.

01:03:15.559 --> 01:03:17.795 position:7% line:83% align:start
These actions don't fit at all
with his technical abilities.

01:03:17.828 --> 01:03:20.398 position:10% line:83% align:start
Couldn't this mean that the
Laughing Man, despite the fact

01:03:20.431 --> 01:03:22.232 position:21% line:83% align:start
that he's so good at
hacking-- or should

01:03:22.265 --> 01:03:25.336 position:13% line:83% align:start
I say because he's good--
didn't place any value at all

01:03:25.369 --> 01:03:27.905 position:7% line:83% align:start
on electronic media, something
that could be rewritten?

01:03:27.938 --> 01:03:30.841 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you think about it, he
was after information that's

01:03:30.875 --> 01:03:33.411 position:21% line:83% align:start
stored in some sort
of physical medium.

01:03:33.444 --> 01:03:36.814 position:5% line:89% align:start
In other words, paper documents.

01:03:36.847 --> 01:03:39.350 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Do you want to investigate
this angle further?

01:03:39.383 --> 01:03:41.218 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Yes.

01:03:41.252 --> 01:03:43.354 position:16% line:83% align:start
-I was going to stop you
if you were doing this out

01:03:43.387 --> 01:03:47.224 position:21% line:83% align:start
of emotional revenge
for that center fiasco.

01:03:47.258 --> 01:03:48.960 position:21% line:83% align:start
But it could be your
ghost has finally

01:03:48.994 --> 01:03:50.728 position:7% line:89% align:start
begun whispering to you, too.

01:03:50.761 --> 01:03:51.562 position:35% line:83% align:start
All right.
Fine.

01:03:55.967 --> 01:03:57.301 position:30% line:89% align:start
You go ahead.

01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:57.936 position:24% line:89% align:start
Do what you want.

01:03:57.969 --> 01:03:58.904 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll fill in the chief.

01:03:58.937 --> 01:04:00.404 position:19% line:89% align:start
-I appreciate, Major.

01:04:18.924 --> 01:04:20.358 position:24% line:89% align:start
-How's it coming?

01:04:23.595 --> 01:04:25.664 position:21% line:89% align:start
-This is a big job.

01:04:25.697 --> 01:04:26.998 position:21% line:89% align:start
Thanks for the help.

01:04:27.032 --> 01:04:29.935 position:27% line:89% align:start
And the coffee.

01:04:29.968 --> 01:04:30.802 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

01:04:30.836 --> 01:04:33.672 position:35% line:89% align:start
Found it.

01:04:33.705 --> 01:04:35.340 position:24% line:89% align:start
WOMAN: Found what?

01:04:35.373 --> 01:04:37.342 position:27% line:83% align:start
-More precisely,
something isn't here

01:04:37.375 --> 01:04:41.013 position:10% line:83% align:start
which ought to be-- the list
of Murai vaccine recipients.

01:04:41.047 --> 01:04:43.749 position:27% line:83% align:start
That file is the
only one missing.

01:04:43.782 --> 01:04:46.551 position:24% line:83% align:start
-I wonder how long
it's been gone.

01:04:46.585 --> 01:04:48.855 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's funny, I don't see how
stealing something like that

01:04:48.888 --> 01:04:50.789 position:13% line:89% align:start
would do anybody any good.

01:04:50.823 --> 01:04:53.558 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Is there anyone you can
think of who would want it?

01:04:53.592 --> 01:04:56.661 position:19% line:83% align:start
You know, someone the
file might be of value to?

01:04:56.695 --> 01:05:00.365 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Uh, well, if I
had to say, I would

01:05:00.398 --> 01:05:02.735 position:10% line:83% align:start
guess the Sunflower Society.
-Sunflower?

01:05:11.511 --> 01:05:14.413 position:24% line:83% align:start
TOGUSA: 2019 AD--
during that year,

01:05:14.447 --> 01:05:17.350 position:13% line:83% align:start
just as cyberization was
starting to become commonplace,

01:05:17.383 --> 01:05:19.952 position:13% line:83% align:start
cases of cyberbrain damage
of an unknown origin

01:05:19.986 --> 01:05:22.855 position:16% line:83% align:start
became a growing concern
in the medical community.

01:05:22.889 --> 01:05:25.591 position:19% line:83% align:start
It was discovered that
gradual hardening in the brain

01:05:25.625 --> 01:05:27.994 position:16% line:83% align:start
occurred in areas where
cyberization had been

01:05:28.027 --> 01:05:30.663 position:21% line:83% align:start
performed, resulting
in brain death.

01:05:30.696 --> 01:05:34.734 position:5% line:83% align:start
This condition later came to be
known as cyberbrain sclerosis.

01:05:34.767 --> 01:05:36.636 position:16% line:83% align:start
Although the likelihood
of displaying the symptoms

01:05:36.669 --> 01:05:38.805 position:21% line:83% align:start
is considerably low,
anyone who's been cyberized

01:05:38.838 --> 01:05:39.973 position:27% line:89% align:start
is susceptible.

01:05:40.007 --> 01:05:42.608 position:13% line:83% align:start
Because there was no basic
treatment once the symptoms

01:05:42.642 --> 01:05:44.744 position:16% line:83% align:start
appeared, it was called
the incurable disease

01:05:44.777 --> 01:05:47.114 position:21% line:83% align:start
of the 21st century,
following in the footsteps

01:05:47.147 --> 01:05:50.750 position:27% line:83% align:start
of tuberculosis,
cancer, and AIDS.

01:05:50.784 --> 01:05:53.854 position:19% line:83% align:start
The Murai vaccine is a
tumor suppressor, developed

01:05:53.887 --> 01:05:56.556 position:27% line:83% align:start
by an M.D. named
Jotose Murai, who

01:05:56.589 --> 01:05:59.458 position:19% line:83% align:start
created this specific
treat for the disease.

01:05:59.492 --> 01:06:01.829 position:21% line:83% align:start
However, the Medical
Association back then

01:06:01.862 --> 01:06:05.398 position:10% line:83% align:start
was dominated by proponents
of micro machine therapy.

01:06:05.431 --> 01:06:07.433 position:27% line:83% align:start
And many of them
voiced the opinion

01:06:07.466 --> 01:06:10.737 position:13% line:83% align:start
that the doctor's vaccine
was a step backwards.

01:06:10.771 --> 01:06:13.073 position:10% line:83% align:start
They were concerned that if
his research was approved,

01:06:13.106 --> 01:06:15.075 position:24% line:83% align:start
it might even hold
back the development

01:06:15.108 --> 01:06:17.144 position:7% line:89% align:start
of a micro machine treatment.

01:06:17.177 --> 01:06:19.146 position:24% line:83% align:start
Perhaps that's the
reason approval

01:06:19.179 --> 01:06:21.481 position:30% line:83% align:start
for the Murai
vaccine was shelved.

01:06:21.515 --> 01:06:24.618 position:24% line:83% align:start
And in February of
2021, Doctor Murai,

01:06:24.651 --> 01:06:26.820 position:19% line:83% align:start
who carried his dream
of a vaccine therapy

01:06:26.854 --> 01:06:31.391 position:16% line:83% align:start
to the very end, died a
broken man at the age of 68

01:06:31.425 --> 01:06:34.528 position:7% line:83% align:start
without seeing a decision from
the Drug Evaluation Council.

01:06:34.561 --> 01:06:37.131 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then, in April of
that same year,

01:06:37.165 --> 01:06:39.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
the vaccine, which had
been denied acceptance,

01:06:40.001 --> 01:06:43.905 position:10% line:83% align:start
was hastily sanctioned as a
fee-based clinical trial drug

01:06:43.938 --> 01:06:47.008 position:21% line:83% align:start
for use by specially
designated patients.

01:06:47.041 --> 01:06:50.011 position:10% line:83% align:start
The approval was never made
known to the general public.

01:06:50.044 --> 01:06:52.981 position:27% line:83% align:start
And the official
position on it today

01:06:53.014 --> 01:06:57.685 position:7% line:83% align:start
is that there are no patients
being treated with the vaccine.

01:06:57.719 --> 01:07:00.420 position:21% line:83% align:start
Even now, one group
remains actively

01:07:00.454 --> 01:07:04.025 position:13% line:83% align:start
interested in this fact--
the Sunflower Society,

01:07:04.058 --> 01:07:07.562 position:7% line:83% align:start
a nonprofit organization that
offers support to individuals

01:07:07.595 --> 01:07:09.797 position:19% line:83% align:start
who want to take major
companies and government

01:07:09.831 --> 01:07:12.734 position:10% line:83% align:start
agencies to court by filing
lawsuits against them.

01:07:21.643 --> 01:07:23.978 position:30% line:89% align:start
-Interesting.

01:07:24.012 --> 01:07:27.682 position:5% line:83% align:start
Looks like you've certainly done
your homework, I'll say that.

01:07:27.715 --> 01:07:31.019 position:19% line:83% align:start
So you're a freelance
journalist, are you?

01:07:31.052 --> 01:07:32.787 position:19% line:89% align:start
-My situation is this.

01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:35.790 position:21% line:83% align:start
I lost my father to
CS a few months back.

01:07:35.823 --> 01:07:37.659 position:16% line:83% align:start
he had been given micro
machine treatment up

01:07:37.692 --> 01:07:39.128 position:21% line:89% align:start
until the very end.

01:07:39.161 --> 01:07:41.629 position:13% line:83% align:start
But after he passed away,
I heard about your group

01:07:41.663 --> 01:07:43.866 position:10% line:89% align:start
and about the Murai vaccine.

01:07:43.899 --> 01:07:45.234 position:33% line:89% align:start
-Oh, I see.

01:07:45.267 --> 01:07:47.169 position:21% line:89% align:start
Sorry for your loss.

01:07:47.202 --> 01:07:48.871 position:27% line:83% align:start
-If only someone
had told us sooner

01:07:48.904 --> 01:07:51.774 position:13% line:83% align:start
about the vaccine and the
excellent results it's had,

01:07:51.807 --> 01:07:54.076 position:5% line:89% align:start
my father might be alive today.

01:07:54.109 --> 01:07:57.980 position:5% line:89% align:start
The thought of it is killing me.

01:07:58.013 --> 01:08:00.481 position:10% line:83% align:start
You see, before now, I never
took an interest in this.

01:08:00.515 --> 01:08:02.084 position:19% line:89% align:start
It didn't concern me.

01:08:02.117 --> 01:08:05.888 position:7% line:83% align:start
But if it can save people who
suffer from that awful disease,

01:08:05.921 --> 01:08:07.256 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'd like to offer my services.

01:08:07.289 --> 01:08:09.024 position:35% line:89% align:start
-How kind.

01:08:09.058 --> 01:08:11.660 position:16% line:83% align:start
A lot of people like you
filled with determination

01:08:11.694 --> 01:08:12.928 position:24% line:89% align:start
used to come here.

01:08:12.962 --> 01:08:15.998 position:16% line:83% align:start
But every single one of
them ended up failing.

01:08:16.031 --> 01:08:16.932 position:30% line:89% align:start
-They failed?

01:08:16.966 --> 01:08:18.534 position:33% line:89% align:start
Why is that?

01:08:18.567 --> 01:08:20.502 position:19% line:83% align:start
-There are individuals
who don't want the public

01:08:20.536 --> 01:08:23.706 position:13% line:83% align:start
to turn its back on micro
machines-- individuals

01:08:23.739 --> 01:08:25.107 position:27% line:89% align:start
from everywhere.

01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:27.576 position:19% line:89% align:start
-Just as I suspected.

01:08:27.609 --> 01:08:30.146 position:24% line:83% align:start
As luck would have
it, I have some pull

01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:31.680 position:7% line:89% align:start
in the entertainment industry.

01:08:31.714 --> 01:08:34.050 position:16% line:83% align:start
And from what I've heard
from my inside sources,

01:08:34.084 --> 01:08:35.784 position:30% line:83% align:start
there are even
people in the biz who

01:08:35.818 --> 01:08:38.989 position:24% line:83% align:start
have been secretly
receiving the vaccine.

01:08:39.022 --> 01:08:43.592 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's not easy to spread
unpleasant news like this.

01:08:43.625 --> 01:08:46.628 position:19% line:83% align:start
So if you want to get
people talking about it,

01:08:46.662 --> 01:08:49.065 position:10% line:83% align:start
I guess you'd need some sort
of scandal, wouldn't you?

01:08:49.099 --> 01:08:51.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Well, it's obvious
you did not come here

01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:53.770 position:19% line:83% align:start
to see us out of some
temporary emotion.

01:09:00.710 --> 01:09:03.913 position:27% line:83% align:start
In fact, we just
acquired a certain file.

01:09:03.947 --> 01:09:11.755 position:38% line:89% align:start
-A file?

01:09:11.788 --> 01:09:12.689 position:33% line:89% align:start
MAN: Dammit.

01:09:12.722 --> 01:09:14.824 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm finished.

01:09:14.858 --> 01:09:17.127 position:21% line:83% align:start
I shouldn't have run
like that, since you

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:18.828 position:5% line:89% align:start
were the one who stole the file.

01:09:18.862 --> 01:09:20.964 position:21% line:83% align:start
They won't have any
choice now, will they?

01:09:20.997 --> 01:09:22.999 position:19% line:83% align:start
They're going to think
that I've betrayed them.

01:09:23.033 --> 01:09:24.868 position:13% line:83% align:start
MAN: If I hadn't arranged
for this to happene,

01:09:24.901 --> 01:09:27.704 position:13% line:83% align:start
you never would have taken
the matter seriously.

01:09:27.737 --> 01:09:29.039 position:21% line:83% align:start
-You have to realize
that they're not

01:09:29.072 --> 01:09:31.275 position:21% line:83% align:start
as forgiving as you
seem to believe.

01:09:31.308 --> 01:09:33.743 position:13% line:83% align:start
-I feel bad about framing
you for the theft.

01:09:33.777 --> 01:09:36.613 position:13% line:83% align:start
I hope you can understand
why I had to resort to that.

01:09:36.646 --> 01:09:38.115 position:27% line:83% align:start
But I swore that
I wouldn't give up

01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:39.950 position:16% line:83% align:start
until I had exposed the
truth of what went on

01:09:39.984 --> 01:09:42.887 position:27% line:83% align:start
behind the micro
machine treatments.

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:44.754 position:13% line:89% align:start
-How can you be so naive?

01:09:44.788 --> 01:09:46.323 position:33% line:83% align:start
Research in
cyberbrain technology

01:09:46.357 --> 01:09:48.625 position:19% line:83% align:start
was advancing in other
fields back then.

01:09:48.658 --> 01:09:50.294 position:24% line:83% align:start
If I had approved
the vaccine, people

01:09:50.327 --> 01:09:51.962 position:21% line:83% align:start
might have rejected
that technology

01:09:51.996 --> 01:09:53.898 position:10% line:89% align:start
and impeded its development.

01:09:53.931 --> 01:09:56.000 position:24% line:83% align:start
-What a convenient
excuse that is.

01:09:56.033 --> 01:09:57.735 position:30% line:83% align:start
Micro Machine
Industries, the company

01:09:57.768 --> 01:09:59.303 position:30% line:83% align:start
whose board of
directors you sat on,

01:09:59.336 --> 01:10:02.039 position:5% line:83% align:start
received approval only one month
after filing it paperwork--

01:10:02.073 --> 01:10:04.842 position:21% line:83% align:start
very quick and easy,
just like Serano.

01:10:04.875 --> 01:10:06.677 position:21% line:83% align:start
And thanks to that,
you people raked

01:10:06.710 --> 01:10:08.646 position:19% line:83% align:start
in profits of nearly a
trillion yen per year

01:10:08.679 --> 01:10:10.714 position:24% line:83% align:start
by selling protein
granules that have

01:10:10.748 --> 01:10:12.850 position:19% line:83% align:start
no effect no effect on
cyberbrain sclerosis.

01:10:12.883 --> 01:10:15.152 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's a blatant act
of fraud perpetrated

01:10:15.186 --> 01:10:17.021 position:21% line:83% align:start
under the direction
of the state.

01:10:17.054 --> 01:10:19.156 position:13% line:83% align:start
What excuses do you intend
to offer those patients who

01:10:19.190 --> 01:10:21.892 position:13% line:83% align:start
died not knowing this and
kept paying their treatment

01:10:21.926 --> 01:10:24.196 position:16% line:83% align:start
fees in the belief that
it actually worked?

01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:26.097 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Micro machines
nowadays are showing

01:10:26.131 --> 01:10:28.065 position:27% line:83% align:start
a certain degree
of effectiveness.

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:31.702 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you look at the situation in
terms of sclerosis prevention,

01:10:31.735 --> 01:10:34.973 position:7% line:83% align:start
you can't say that nothing of
benefit came from our decision.

01:10:35.006 --> 01:10:36.308 position:35% line:89% align:start
-Benefit?

01:10:36.341 --> 01:10:37.976 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, then, if that's
the case, why aren't you

01:10:38.009 --> 01:10:39.377 position:19% line:83% align:start
treating yourself with
the micro machines?

01:10:51.323 --> 01:10:52.924 position:16% line:89% align:start
-Here, come take a look.

01:10:52.958 --> 01:10:56.194 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Huh?

01:10:56.228 --> 01:10:58.296 position:21% line:83% align:start
Isn't he an author?
-That's right.

01:10:58.330 --> 01:11:01.233 position:16% line:83% align:start
There are also artists,
former star athletes.

01:11:01.266 --> 01:11:03.935 position:24% line:83% align:start
And this man is a
professor at Miyahama

01:11:03.969 --> 01:11:06.037 position:10% line:83% align:start
University's medical school.
-Wait a minute.

01:11:06.071 --> 01:11:07.038 position:21% line:83% align:start
There are even names
of politicians.

01:11:07.072 --> 01:11:08.773 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Yes.

01:11:08.807 --> 01:11:10.242 position:19% line:83% align:start
And someone even more
critical to our cause

01:11:10.275 --> 01:11:14.146 position:19% line:89% align:start
is taking the vaccine.

01:11:14.179 --> 01:11:16.781 position:24% line:89% align:start
Can you spot him?

01:11:16.815 --> 01:11:18.850 position:27% line:83% align:start
TOGUSA: Hisashi
Imakurusu, chairman

01:11:18.884 --> 01:11:21.019 position:10% line:83% align:start
of the board of the Central
Drug Evaluation Council?

01:11:21.052 --> 01:11:25.056 position:5% line:83% align:start
Are you saying the chairman who
rejected the Murai vaccine is

01:11:25.090 --> 01:11:26.925 position:5% line:89% align:start
dependent on that same medicine?

01:11:26.958 --> 01:11:28.161 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Yes.

01:11:28.194 --> 01:11:31.397 position:5% line:83% align:start
The file arrived here yesterday
from Mr. Imakurusu himself.

01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:33.399 position:10% line:89% align:start
-What does all of this mean?

01:11:33.432 --> 01:11:36.269 position:5% line:83% align:start
-He's claiming that he's grown
exhausted from having to remain

01:11:36.302 --> 01:11:40.206 position:19% line:83% align:start
silent all these years
about what they'd done.

01:11:40.239 --> 01:11:41.908 position:13% line:89% align:start
He knew it was effective.

01:11:41.941 --> 01:11:44.944 position:16% line:83% align:start
However, he deliberately
suppressed the Murai

01:11:44.977 --> 01:11:47.246 position:5% line:89% align:start
vaccine out of ulterior motives.

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:49.815 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now, Imakurusu has
given his solemn word

01:11:49.849 --> 01:11:51.984 position:21% line:83% align:start
to stand up in court
in front of a judge

01:11:52.018 --> 01:11:54.120 position:16% line:83% align:start
and divulge this motive
that only he knows.

01:11:54.153 --> 01:11:56.322 position:24% line:83% align:start
-You mean the drug
evaluation chairman

01:11:56.355 --> 01:12:00.092 position:7% line:83% align:start
is gonna testify as to why he
wouldn't approve the vaccine?

01:12:00.126 --> 01:12:01.027 position:38% line:89% align:start
-Uh-huh.

01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:02.995 position:10% line:89% align:start
This time, victory is ours.

01:12:03.029 --> 01:12:03.497 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:04.464 position:27% line:89% align:start
[loud rumbling]

01:12:38.165 --> 01:12:41.034 position:21% line:83% align:start

Suppression Squad.

01:12:41.068 --> 01:12:42.202 position:35% line:83% align:start
[coughing]
-Move it.

01:12:42.236 --> 01:12:42.735 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on.

01:12:42.768 --> 01:12:43.937 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hurry and kill them.

01:12:43.971 --> 01:12:46.240 position:7% line:83% align:start
We can take our time and look
for our target afterwards.

01:12:46.273 --> 01:12:48.475 position:13% line:89% align:start
But first, kill them all!

01:12:48.508 --> 01:12:51.411 position:7% line:83% align:start
-They're from the Ministry of
Health, Labor, and Welfare.

01:12:51.445 --> 01:12:53.880 position:13% line:89% align:start
-Then they want the file?

01:12:53.914 --> 01:12:54.982 position:5% line:89% align:start
-You've got to get out of here.

01:12:55.015 --> 01:12:56.149 position:27% line:83% align:start
These people are
trained assassins.

01:12:56.183 --> 01:12:57.985 position:21% line:89% align:start
They will kill you.

01:12:58.018 --> 01:12:59.520 position:24% line:89% align:start
-Just who are you?

01:12:59.554 --> 01:13:00.921 position:13% line:89% align:start
-I'm with Public Security.

01:13:06.026 --> 01:13:07.894 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Oops, some of our
boys got taken down.

01:13:20.541 --> 01:13:23.544 position:21% line:83% align:start
We need to take some
losses on our side, too.

01:13:23.578 --> 01:13:26.847 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's just how reality works.
Right?

01:13:49.037 --> 01:13:50.938 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now, go search the corpse.

-Ah, now things are
getting interesting.

01:14:19.401 --> 01:14:20.602 position:27% line:89% align:start
Got a survivor.

01:14:20.636 --> 01:14:21.969 position:30% line:89% align:start
Get over here.

01:14:26.941 --> 01:14:28.143 position:30% line:89% align:start
Tell you what.

01:14:28.177 --> 01:14:30.212 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll give you a running

01:14:34.249 --> 01:14:35.084 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ah, damn.

01:14:35.117 --> 01:14:37.653 position:27% line:83% align:start
That was our own

01:14:37.686 --> 01:14:41.590 position:27% line:83% align:start
Go on, get down

01:14:41.623 --> 01:14:43.225 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Shit.

01:14:43.258 --> 01:14:45.160 position:21% line:83% align:start
Maybe I should have
gone full cyborg, too.

completed the op.

But the item is a copy.

-What did you say?

01:15:12.655 --> 01:15:14.957 position:10% line:89% align:start

01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:17.260 position:24% line:89% align:start
It was Imakurusu.

01:15:17.293 --> 01:15:19.329 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Do you mean to say you've
got the original, you

01:15:19.362 --> 01:15:20.929 position:27% line:89% align:start
son of a bitch?

01:15:20.963 --> 01:15:22.232 position:38% line:83% align:start
-No, no.
I wasn't the one.

01:15:22.265 --> 01:15:24.200 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm not to blame.

01:15:24.234 --> 01:15:26.536 position:19% line:83% align:start
-I heard that file the
Sunflower Society had

01:15:26.569 --> 01:15:29.606 position:13% line:83% align:start
was a duplicate which was
sent to them from your office.

01:15:29.639 --> 01:15:32.475 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't tell me you're feeling
repentant after all this time.

01:15:32.509 --> 01:15:35.178 position:24% line:83% align:start
-What do I have to
gain by doing that?

01:15:35.211 --> 01:15:38.281 position:7% line:83% align:start
Someone was passing themselves
off as me, that's all.

01:15:38.314 --> 01:15:40.049 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Then what the hell
is your name doing

01:15:40.083 --> 01:15:41.618 position:30% line:83% align:start
on the list of
vaccine recipients?

01:15:41.651 --> 01:15:43.186 position:38% line:89% align:start
-I-- I--

01:15:43.219 --> 01:15:44.020 position:35% line:89% align:start
-Tell me.

01:15:44.053 --> 01:15:47.725 position:33% line:83% align:start
Do you have
cyberbrain sclerosis?

01:15:47.758 --> 01:15:50.193 position:7% line:89% align:start
-It's been quite a while now.

01:15:50.226 --> 01:15:53.263 position:13% line:83% align:start
They tell me it's already
in the final stages.

01:15:53.296 --> 01:15:56.499 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Why didn't you come talk
to me first about this?

01:15:56.534 --> 01:16:00.136 position:13% line:83% align:start
How could you leave your
records on that list, you fool?

01:16:00.170 --> 01:16:02.038 position:38% line:89% align:start
-Sorry.

01:16:02.071 --> 01:16:04.508 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's just that the
vaccine really works.

01:16:04.542 --> 01:16:06.544 position:19% line:83% align:start
-But we've known that
all along, you idiot!

01:16:06.577 --> 01:16:09.580 position:24% line:89% align:start
We'll talk later.

01:16:09.613 --> 01:16:11.014 position:24% line:83% align:start
CYBORG: What would
you like me to do?

01:16:11.047 --> 01:16:13.049 position:30% line:83% align:start
Eliminate him?
-Shut up.

01:16:13.082 --> 01:16:13.617 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'll get back to you.

01:16:18.556 --> 01:16:22.092 position:30% line:83% align:start
Final stages.
That fool.

01:16:26.263 --> 01:16:27.598 position:38% line:89% align:start
-Togusa.

01:16:27.631 --> 01:16:28.532 position:16% line:89% align:start
-You can't come in here.

01:16:28.566 --> 01:16:31.569 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's in very serious
condition right now.

01:16:31.602 --> 01:16:34.605 position:38% line:89% align:start
-Major.

01:16:34.638 --> 01:16:37.575 position:5% line:89% align:start
Take a look through my memories.

01:16:37.608 --> 01:16:40.211 position:27% line:89% align:start
It was the MHLW.

01:16:40.244 --> 01:16:43.080 position:24% line:83% align:start
Lucky for you, the
bullets missed my head.

01:16:43.113 --> 01:16:44.749 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Intubate.
DOCTOR: Right.

01:16:44.783 --> 01:16:46.383 position:30% line:83% align:start
-While you're
operating on him, I

01:16:46.417 --> 01:16:49.286 position:10% line:83% align:start
want you to extract the last
16 hours of his memories

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:50.321 position:21% line:89% align:start
from his cyberbrain.

01:16:50.354 --> 01:16:51.355 position:35% line:89% align:start
-I can't.

01:16:51.388 --> 01:16:52.523 position:27% line:89% align:start
ARAMAKI: Do it.

01:16:52.557 --> 01:16:55.092 position:10% line:83% align:start
Right now that information's
absolutely crucial to us.

01:16:55.125 --> 01:16:55.594 position:27% line:89% align:start
We must have it.

01:16:55.627 --> 01:17:03.468 position:24% line:89% align:start
KUSANAGI: There's

01:17:03.502 --> 01:17:06.371 position:10% line:89% align:start
Must be from the anesthetic.

01:17:06.404 --> 01:17:08.306 position:21% line:83% align:start
We'll be picking up
everything, right down

01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:10.375 position:27% line:83% align:start
to his emotional
fluctuations, so it

01:17:10.408 --> 01:17:12.410 position:24% line:83% align:start
might even affect
our own reactions.

01:17:12.444 --> 01:17:13.645 position:21% line:89% align:start
-It can't be helped.

01:17:13.678 --> 01:17:16.113 position:38% line:89% align:start
Play it.

01:17:16.146 --> 01:17:17.047 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Damn.

01:17:17.081 --> 01:17:19.217 position:24% line:83% align:start
If he goes around
playing hero like this,

01:17:19.251 --> 01:17:21.453 position:24% line:83% align:start
you know the dumb
bastard's gonna get nailed.

01:17:24.589 --> 01:17:26.525 position:7% line:89% align:start
-Let's go over the situation.

01:17:26.558 --> 01:17:28.660 position:10% line:83% align:start
Togusa had figured out what
the hacker from the aids center

01:17:28.693 --> 01:17:31.196 position:35% line:83% align:start
was after.
It was paper media.

01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:33.431 position:5% line:83% align:start
So he made a number of trips to
the Ministry of Health, Labor,

01:17:33.465 --> 01:17:35.500 position:30% line:83% align:start
and Welfare to
verify his suspicion.

01:17:35.534 --> 01:17:37.803 position:10% line:83% align:start
-And out of the vast amount
of documents he researched,

01:17:37.837 --> 01:17:41.106 position:10% line:83% align:start
he discovered the existence
of a missing file.

01:17:41.139 --> 01:17:42.240 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Which, as it turns
out, is a record

01:17:42.274 --> 01:17:44.509 position:27% line:83% align:start
of all the Murai
vaccine recipients.

01:17:44.543 --> 01:17:45.577 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Mmhm.

01:17:45.610 --> 01:17:47.345 position:16% line:83% align:start
That file was extremely
important to the Sunflower

01:17:47.379 --> 01:17:48.413 position:38% line:89% align:start
Society.

01:17:48.446 --> 01:17:50.583 position:16% line:83% align:start
And Togusa was attacked
when he went to see them.

01:17:50.616 --> 01:17:52.752 position:13% line:83% align:start
But we don't know exactly
what happened there.

01:17:52.785 --> 01:17:54.787 position:27% line:89% align:start
-No, we do know.

01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:56.589 position:19% line:89% align:start
-The DEA shot Togusa.

01:17:56.622 --> 01:17:59.859 position:5% line:83% align:start
The Narcotics Suppression Squad
specializes in violent crimes,

01:17:59.892 --> 01:18:02.193 position:10% line:83% align:start
watching bunch of civilians.
Very simple.

01:18:02.227 --> 01:18:04.095 position:21% line:83% align:start
-And their objective
was the seizure

01:18:04.129 --> 01:18:05.464 position:10% line:89% align:start
or elimination of the file?

01:18:05.498 --> 01:18:07.433 position:16% line:83% align:start
It seems like the cause
of all of this centers

01:18:07.466 --> 01:18:09.335 position:7% line:89% align:start
around one name we discovered.

01:18:09.368 --> 01:18:10.836 position:19% line:89% align:start
This Imakurusu person.

01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:13.171 position:21% line:83% align:start
-We're wasting time
with these discussions.

01:18:13.205 --> 01:18:14.473 position:21% line:83% align:start
We'll find out soon
enough if we go

01:18:14.507 --> 01:18:16.375 position:24% line:83% align:start
bust those filthy
DEA sons of bitches.

01:18:16.409 --> 01:18:17.443 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on.

01:18:17.476 --> 01:18:19.512 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Don't let those memories
affect your judgment.

01:18:19.545 --> 01:18:20.713 position:27% line:83% align:start
No doubt they're
a step ahead of us

01:18:20.746 --> 01:18:23.716 position:7% line:83% align:start
and already leaking falsified
information to the press.

01:18:23.749 --> 01:18:25.284 position:13% line:89% align:start
The truth is being erased.

01:18:28.487 --> 01:18:32.158 position:13% line:89% align:start
KUSANAGI: This is our man?

01:18:32.191 --> 01:18:33.092 position:33% line:89% align:start
ARAMAKI: OK.

01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:36.195 position:19% line:83% align:start
Major, you pay a visit
to Mr. Imakurusu.

01:18:36.228 --> 01:18:38.832 position:5% line:83% align:start
Meanwhile, I'll try to find out
how the Narcotics Suppression

01:18:38.865 --> 01:18:41.667 position:27% line:83% align:start
Squad came to be
mobilized in this affair.

01:18:41.701 --> 01:18:43.636 position:16% line:83% align:start
We'll also petition the
American empire for access

01:18:43.670 --> 01:18:46.272 position:16% line:83% align:start
to their ECHELON system.
-Roger.

01:18:48.842 --> 01:18:51.612 position:21% line:83% align:start
Pazu and Saito, you
two come with me.

01:18:51.645 --> 01:18:54.615 position:5% line:83% align:start
Batou, you're on memory analysis
with Ishikawa and Borma.

01:18:54.648 --> 01:18:55.314 position:33% line:89% align:start
-Screw that!

01:18:55.348 --> 01:18:57.718 position:7% line:89% align:start
Put me on a DEA investigation.

01:18:57.751 --> 01:19:00.219 position:21% line:83% align:start
-And do what wearing
that look on your face?

01:19:00.252 --> 01:19:02.154 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll give you a call
when I need you.

01:19:02.188 --> 01:19:04.791 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Well, how the hell do
you expect me to look?

01:19:04.825 --> 01:19:07.494 position:13% line:83% align:start
-All she's saying is that
you need to cool off a bit.

01:19:07.527 --> 01:19:09.630 position:21% line:83% align:start
-How am I gonna cool
off after seeing that?

01:19:09.663 --> 01:19:11.632 position:13% line:83% align:start
ISHIKAWA: You're under the
influence of Togusa's memories

01:19:11.665 --> 01:19:12.299 position:35% line:89% align:start
right now.

01:19:12.332 --> 01:19:13.567 position:10% line:89% align:start
She made a good call, Batou.

01:19:28.548 --> 01:19:30.217 position:27% line:89% align:start
[phone ringing]

01:19:30.250 --> 01:19:32.452 position:21% line:83% align:start
MAN: I'm very sorry
about the weather.

01:19:32.486 --> 01:19:33.520 position:27% line:89% align:start
What can I say?

01:19:33.553 --> 01:19:34.688 position:7% line:89% align:start
MAN: Eh, it's not your fault.

01:19:34.721 --> 01:19:35.722 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about it.

01:19:35.756 --> 01:19:37.825 position:21% line:83% align:start
Today's the only day
that worked for everyone.

01:19:41.395 --> 01:19:43.363 position:24% line:83% align:start
Please, you've got
to help me out.

01:19:43.397 --> 01:19:46.500 position:10% line:83% align:start
Talk to Niimi and straighten
out this misunderstanding.

01:19:46.533 --> 01:19:47.068 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

01:19:47.101 --> 01:19:48.569 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm at the golf course.

01:19:48.603 --> 01:19:49.469 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm counting on you.

01:19:53.675 --> 01:19:54.609 position:24% line:89% align:start
ISHIKAWA: Got it.

01:19:54.642 --> 01:19:56.309 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's big brother for you.

01:19:56.343 --> 01:19:57.310 position:27% line:83% align:start
BORMA: We don't
know for sure yet.

01:19:57.344 --> 01:19:59.814 position:19% line:83% align:start
Our voice print search
got a hit on the word

01:19:59.847 --> 01:20:01.783 position:16% line:89% align:start
"Imakurusu," that's all.

01:20:01.816 --> 01:20:03.418 position:24% line:89% align:start
-How's it coming?

01:20:03.451 --> 01:20:05.553 position:16% line:83% align:start
-We just pinpointed the
location of a terminal that

01:20:05.586 --> 01:20:08.723 position:16% line:83% align:start
was used by a man who we
believe to be Imakurusu.

01:20:08.756 --> 01:20:13.661 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now, we need to determine
whether or not it's really him.

01:20:13.695 --> 01:20:16.998 position:27% line:89% align:start
[phone ringing]

01:20:17.031 --> 01:20:21.469 position:16% line:83% align:start

direct line, Bureau Chief.

01:20:21.502 --> 01:20:22.737 position:33% line:89% align:start
-Niimi here.

01:20:22.770 --> 01:20:23.938 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is that the truth?

01:20:23.972 --> 01:20:25.740 position:44% line:83% align:start
Yes.
Right.

01:20:25.773 --> 01:20:26.942 position:24% line:83% align:start
No, I'll deal with
him immediately.

01:20:30.611 --> 01:20:31.779 position:19% line:89% align:start
Gayle, it's me, Niimi.

01:20:31.813 --> 01:20:33.347 position:7% line:89% align:start
We have Imakurusu's location.

01:20:33.381 --> 01:20:34.883 position:5% line:89% align:start
He's at the Kohoku Country Club.

01:20:34.917 --> 01:20:35.650 position:27% line:89% align:start
Get over there.

01:20:42.825 --> 01:20:45.493 position:10% line:83% align:start
BORMA: His present location
is the Kohoku Country Club.

01:20:45.526 --> 01:20:47.462 position:13% line:83% align:start
He was spotted at a public
terminal on a sidewalk

01:20:47.495 --> 01:20:49.530 position:24% line:83% align:start
on the north side
just two minutes ago.

01:20:49.565 --> 01:20:50.431 position:30% line:89% align:start
BATOU: Bingo.

01:20:59.675 --> 01:21:01.343 position:13% line:83% align:start
BORMA: It's who he called
that has me worried.

01:21:01.376 --> 01:21:02.544 position:13% line:89% align:start
-I only want his location.

01:21:02.578 --> 01:21:04.580 position:27% line:83% align:start
Old man, I'll be
there before the major

01:21:04.613 --> 01:21:05.380 position:19% line:89% align:start
if I take the chopper.

01:21:05.414 --> 01:21:06.315 position:44% line:89% align:start
-Go.

01:21:06.348 --> 01:21:09.585 position:19% line:83% align:start
Better you secure him
than someone else.

01:21:09.618 --> 01:21:12.488 position:16% line:83% align:start
BORMA: Ishikawa, do you
have a trace on Imakurusu?

01:21:12.521 --> 01:21:15.057 position:7% line:83% align:start
-After his call, he went into
room 909 in the hotel annex.

01:21:15.090 --> 01:21:17.493 position:13% line:89% align:start
He's staying put for now.

01:21:17.526 --> 01:21:19.962 position:19% line:83% align:start
Borma, what does this
look like to you?

01:21:19.995 --> 01:21:21.330 position:41% line:89% align:start
Here.

01:21:21.363 --> 01:21:23.032 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Uh, the authentication
code that's

01:21:23.066 --> 01:21:26.069 position:16% line:83% align:start
got top priority on the
American empire's wire tap list?

01:21:26.102 --> 01:21:28.570 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Yeah, it's not supposed
to officially exist.

01:21:28.604 --> 01:21:30.405 position:13% line:83% align:start
But isn't this the number
for the headquarters

01:21:30.439 --> 01:21:31.841 position:21% line:83% align:start
of the government's
ruling party?

01:21:38.014 --> 01:21:41.350 position:16% line:83% align:start
-So what do you think of
that JMSDF type 303, sir?

01:21:41.383 --> 01:21:43.318 position:21% line:83% align:start
-These marine unites
are really streamlined.

01:21:43.352 --> 01:21:45.387 position:7% line:89% align:start
Damn things are works of art.

01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:47.557 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now, if only those
guys would show up,

01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:48.691 position:24% line:83% align:start
we could get some
live combat data.

01:21:52.562 --> 01:21:54.898 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Commander, I'm
picking up a chopper

01:21:54.931 --> 01:21:56.032 position:27% line:83% align:start
heading for the
target's building.

01:21:56.065 --> 01:21:57.000 position:19% line:89% align:start
Looks like Section 9.

01:21:57.033 --> 01:21:58.601 position:16% line:89% align:start
-Well, what do you know?

01:21:58.635 --> 01:21:59.869 position:24% line:89% align:start
What great timing.

01:21:59.903 --> 01:22:03.373 position:7% line:83% align:start
Now, you guys can show me what
you got by securing Imakurusu.

01:22:03.406 --> 01:22:05.608 position:19% line:83% align:start
It'll take a while to
get my systems booted.

01:22:05.642 --> 01:22:08.545 position:7% line:83% align:start
Once you cut off their escape
route, leave the rest to me.

01:22:13.516 --> 01:22:15.418 position:13% line:89% align:start
BATOU: What the-- is that?

01:22:25.495 --> 01:22:27.597 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hisachi Imakurusu,
I'm with the police.

01:22:27.630 --> 01:22:29.465 position:10% line:89% align:start
The narc squad's on its way.

01:22:29.499 --> 01:22:30.433 position:13% line:89% align:start
We're getting out of here.

01:22:30.466 --> 01:22:31.601 position:21% line:89% align:start
-Stay away from me!

01:22:53.824 --> 01:22:54.925 position:5% line:89% align:start
KUSANAGI: Batou, you all right?

01:22:54.959 --> 01:22:56.160 position:27% line:89% align:start
-Yeah, for now.

01:22:56.193 --> 01:22:57.795 position:5% line:89% align:start
But they've got us pinned down.

01:22:57.828 --> 01:22:59.530 position:19% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: Can you make
it out in the chopper?

01:22:59.563 --> 01:23:00.164 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Nope.

01:23:00.197 --> 01:23:01.699 position:13% line:89% align:start
Not with this guy in tow.

01:23:01.732 --> 01:23:02.933 position:24% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: Do what
you can to hold out.

01:23:02.967 --> 01:23:03.934 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm almost there.

01:23:03.968 --> 01:23:04.835 position:10% line:89% align:start
BATOU (VOICEOVER): Ah, yeah.

01:23:14.712 --> 01:23:16.847 position:7% line:83% align:start
They can cloak, but they can't
completely hide themselves.

01:23:16.881 --> 01:23:18.649 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on, what's your next move?

01:23:33.198 --> 01:23:36.201 position:27% line:89% align:start
That you, Major?

01:23:36.234 --> 01:23:37.135 position:7% line:89% align:start
-I've secured an escape route.

01:23:37.168 --> 01:23:39.137 position:24% line:83% align:start
But for now, let's
get back to the lobby.

01:23:58.924 --> 01:23:59.891 position:35% line:89% align:start
Get down!

01:24:04.062 --> 01:24:05.497 position:30% line:89% align:start
What was that?

01:24:09.701 --> 01:24:14.005 position:7% line:83% align:start
BATOU: It's a damned arm suit.
KUSANAGI: Batou, get ready.

01:24:14.039 --> 01:24:15.141 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll draw it off.

01:24:15.174 --> 01:24:16.108 position:16% line:89% align:start
BATOU: Don't be stupid.

01:24:16.142 --> 01:24:17.976 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's what you have me for.

01:24:18.010 --> 01:24:20.179 position:7% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: I have faith in you,
but you can't stop that thing.

01:24:20.212 --> 01:24:21.613 position:24% line:83% align:start
Take Imakurusu and
get out of here.

01:24:21.646 --> 01:24:23.983 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's an order from
your superior office.

01:24:24.016 --> 01:24:25.151 position:33% line:83% align:start
BATOU: Fine.
I'll do it.

01:24:25.184 --> 01:24:26.751 position:13% line:89% align:start
Don't get yourself killed.

01:24:44.003 --> 01:24:45.104 position:30% line:83% align:start
SAITO: Major,
we're almost there.

01:25:50.370 --> 01:25:52.039 position:7% line:89% align:start
-A direct hit didn't punch it?

01:26:04.918 --> 01:26:06.787 position:38% line:89% align:start
-Saito!

01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:08.655 position:13% line:89% align:start
Fork over that weapon now!

01:26:18.665 --> 01:26:20.634 position:33% line:89% align:start
-Hey, wait!

01:26:20.667 --> 01:26:21.936 position:30% line:89% align:start
Pop my hatch!

01:26:43.124 --> 01:26:44.892 position:30% line:89% align:start
Can't breathe.

01:26:44.926 --> 01:26:46.060 position:38% line:89% align:start
Please.

01:26:46.094 --> 01:26:47.361 position:30% line:89% align:start
Pop the hatch.

01:26:53.101 --> 01:26:55.370 position:24% line:83% align:start
-A little closer.
Good.

01:27:09.050 --> 01:27:10.285 position:13% line:89% align:start
Get this guy aboard, ASAP.

01:27:13.921 --> 01:27:15.690 position:30% line:89% align:start
What a moron.

01:27:15.723 --> 01:27:17.159 position:35% line:89% align:start
Wait here.

01:27:17.192 --> 01:27:18.427 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hey, hold it right there.

01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:22.030 position:33% line:83% align:start
Both of you.
Good.

01:27:22.064 --> 01:27:22.998 position:24% line:89% align:start
Don't even blink.

01:27:23.031 --> 01:27:23.899 position:35% line:89% align:start
Imakurusu.

01:27:38.947 --> 01:27:40.682 position:13% line:83% align:start
BATOU: Our guy's been hit.
Requesting ambulance.

01:27:46.088 --> 01:27:50.325 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Laughing Man, is that
what you really look like?

01:27:50.359 --> 01:27:53.262 position:30% line:89% align:start
-What's that?

01:27:53.295 --> 01:27:54.930 position:24% line:89% align:start
The Laughing Man?

01:27:54.963 --> 01:27:55.931 position:24% line:89% align:start
What does he mean?

01:27:55.964 --> 01:28:01.837 position:41% line:89% align:start
Wait.

01:28:01.870 --> 01:28:08.844 position:30% line:83% align:start
This file is--
optical camouflage?

01:28:08.877 --> 01:28:11.080 position:24% line:89% align:start
No, that's not it.

01:28:11.114 --> 01:28:12.215 position:33% line:89% align:start
You bastard.

01:28:12.248 --> 01:28:13.416 position:10% line:89% align:start
I know why I can't see you.

01:28:13.449 --> 01:28:14.816 position:21% line:89% align:start
You hacked my eyes.

01:28:22.791 --> 01:28:23.960 position:30% line:89% align:start
Where are you?

01:28:23.993 --> 01:28:24.994 position:24% line:89% align:start
Are you close by?

01:28:28.231 --> 01:28:29.999 position:16% line:89% align:start
Where the hell are you?

01:28:50.253 --> 01:28:51.488 position:30% line:89% align:start
-They're here.

01:28:51.522 --> 01:28:53.756 position:24% line:83% align:start
Aramaki won't get
any further than me.

01:28:53.790 --> 01:28:54.458 position:30% line:89% align:start
Tell him that.

01:28:54.491 --> 01:28:55.892 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Yes, sir.
I understand.

01:29:05.236 --> 01:29:07.438 position:35% line:89% align:start
[knocking]

01:29:07.471 --> 01:29:09.406 position:27% line:89% align:start
CHIEF: Come in.

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:11.175 position:33% line:89% align:start
-Pardon us.

01:29:11.208 --> 01:29:14.378 position:10% line:83% align:start
Bureau Chief Niimi, I have a
warrant here for your arrest.

01:29:14.411 --> 01:29:16.981 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're being charged in
the murder conspiracy tied

01:29:17.014 --> 01:29:19.283 position:21% line:83% align:start
to the investigation
for Sunflower Society,

01:29:19.316 --> 01:29:21.418 position:21% line:83% align:start
as well as the death
of Mr. Imakurusu.

01:29:21.452 --> 01:29:25.022 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you would please
come with us.

01:29:25.055 --> 01:29:27.324 position:19% line:83% align:start
-I heard what happened
with the narc squad.

01:29:27.358 --> 01:29:30.194 position:7% line:83% align:start
But it's absurd to think that
I had anything to do whatsoever

01:29:30.227 --> 01:29:32.129 position:21% line:83% align:start
with the ordering of
Imakurusu's death.

01:29:32.162 --> 01:29:36.133 position:10% line:83% align:start
The head of the narc squad,
a man named Gayle Yasuoka,

01:29:36.166 --> 01:29:39.003 position:16% line:83% align:start
is much more willing to
talk than we expected.

01:29:39.036 --> 01:29:41.939 position:16% line:83% align:start
You see, he recorded his
conversations with you.

01:29:41.972 --> 01:29:44.441 position:5% line:89% align:start
And he is being most cooperate.

01:29:44.476 --> 01:29:46.143 position:24% line:83% align:start
We know about the
Laughing Man incident

01:29:46.176 --> 01:29:49.346 position:16% line:83% align:start
and how it motivated you
to have Imakurusu killed.

01:29:49.381 --> 01:29:52.216 position:10% line:83% align:start
So as you can see, you and I
have a great deal to discuss.

01:29:52.249 --> 01:29:55.886 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Fine.
Let's get this over with.

01:29:55.919 --> 01:29:56.421 position:27% line:89% align:start
-Take him away.

01:30:09.033 --> 01:30:12.537 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Batou, I want you to
investigate the narc squad

01:30:12.570 --> 01:30:15.006 position:10% line:83% align:start
and find out why they would
go to such extreme measures

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:16.941 position:27% line:83% align:start
to retrieve the
vaccine recipient list.

01:30:16.975 --> 01:30:19.044 position:19% line:89% align:start
Find the real reason.

01:30:19.077 --> 01:30:21.546 position:21% line:83% align:start
Another thing-- the
surviving members

01:30:21.579 --> 01:30:23.882 position:27% line:83% align:start
may be lying low
somewhere out there.

01:30:23.915 --> 01:30:25.283 position:35% line:89% align:start
Watch out.

01:30:25.317 --> 01:30:27.419 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll head back when
we're done with Niimi.

01:30:27.452 --> 01:30:30.355 position:30% line:89% align:start
Over and out.

01:30:30.388 --> 01:30:32.590 position:27% line:83% align:start
-The chief, huh?
-Yeah.

01:30:32.624 --> 01:30:35.594 position:16% line:83% align:start
The chief just arrested
some bureaucrat named Niimi.

01:30:35.628 --> 01:30:38.530 position:13% line:83% align:start
Looks like he was the man
behind the narc squad.

01:30:38.564 --> 01:30:40.265 position:35% line:89% align:start
-That so?

01:30:40.298 --> 01:30:43.001 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, at least my getting
perforated was worth something.

01:30:43.034 --> 01:30:45.538 position:24% line:83% align:start
But what was that
powered exoskeleton?

01:30:45.571 --> 01:30:47.640 position:24% line:83% align:start
-A little toy the
narc squad was somehow

01:30:47.673 --> 01:30:50.175 position:10% line:89% align:start
able to get their hands on.

01:30:50.208 --> 01:30:51.610 position:19% line:89% align:start
The major took it on.

01:30:51.644 --> 01:30:53.512 position:19% line:83% align:start
She overheated in the
fight, and now she's

01:30:53.546 --> 01:30:55.381 position:5% line:89% align:start
swapping her body for a new one.

01:30:55.414 --> 01:30:57.483 position:24% line:83% align:start
TOGUSA: Is she OK?
BATOU: Well, yeah.

01:30:57.516 --> 01:31:02.355 position:5% line:83% align:start
But, uh-- what you said before
about your eyes getting hacked?

01:31:02.388 --> 01:31:06.024 position:13% line:89% align:start
Same thing happened to me.

01:31:06.057 --> 01:31:06.726 position:30% line:89% align:start
See you later.

01:31:06.759 --> 01:31:09.161 position:7% line:89% align:start
I've got a ton of stuff to do.

01:31:09.195 --> 01:31:10.329 position:19% line:83% align:start
Here, I'll leave this
with you for now.

01:31:16.268 --> 01:31:17.570 position:27% line:89% align:start
-This is-- wait.

01:31:17.603 --> 01:31:18.471 position:10% line:89% align:start
You mean the Laughing Man--

01:31:41.026 --> 01:31:43.396 position:27% line:83% align:start
-I apologize for
keeping you waiting.

01:31:43.429 --> 01:31:45.264 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll be in charge.

01:31:45.297 --> 01:31:48.100 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm Sano.

01:31:48.134 --> 01:31:50.604 position:27% line:83% align:start
This isn't your
first time, right?

01:31:50.637 --> 01:31:51.571 position:13% line:89% align:start
There's no need to worry.

01:31:51.605 --> 01:31:53.205 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'll be gentle.

01:32:00.012 --> 01:32:01.080 position:27% line:89% align:start
All right, then.

01:32:01.113 --> 01:32:03.316 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm just gonna take a
little look under the hood,

01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:04.351 position:24% line:89% align:start
if you don't mind.

01:32:07.287 --> 01:32:08.221 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, my.

01:32:08.255 --> 01:32:11.358 position:19% line:89% align:start
You have a fine body.

01:32:11.391 --> 01:32:12.559 position:33% line:89% align:start
[chuckling]

01:32:29.576 --> 01:32:31.211 position:27% line:89% align:start
How you feeling?

01:32:31.244 --> 01:32:33.146 position:19% line:89% align:start
Does your brain hurt?

01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:35.048 position:21% line:83% align:start
-That supposed to be
some kind of joke?

01:32:35.081 --> 01:32:36.684 position:16% line:83% align:start
The brain's not capable
of sensing pain.

01:32:36.717 --> 01:32:38.418 position:21% line:89% align:start
-Don't be like that.

01:32:38.452 --> 01:32:41.021 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's no reason we can't
take our time and enjoy this.

01:32:41.054 --> 01:32:43.023 position:21% line:83% align:start
Or could it be that
you don't like me?

01:32:43.056 --> 01:32:45.225 position:27% line:83% align:start
-No offense, but
that's it exactly.

01:32:45.258 --> 01:32:48.028 position:10% line:83% align:start
Now that we're both clear on
that, can we get on with this?

01:32:48.061 --> 01:32:50.297 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm in a bit of a rush.

01:32:50.331 --> 01:32:52.300 position:7% line:89% align:start
-My, someone's in a bad mood.

01:32:55.202 --> 01:32:58.071 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've decided to lock
down your speech center.

01:32:58.104 --> 01:33:00.608 position:19% line:83% align:start
Of course, it's not as
if someone would come

01:33:00.641 --> 01:33:04.245 position:13% line:83% align:start
to your rescue anyway, no
matter how loud you shouted.

01:33:12.253 --> 01:33:16.224 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ms. Kusanagi, how's my
little patient feeling now?

01:33:16.257 --> 01:33:17.091 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, my.

01:33:17.124 --> 01:33:19.260 position:24% line:83% align:start
What a rebellious
look in your eyes.

01:33:19.293 --> 01:33:21.629 position:19% line:89% align:start
That simply won't do.

01:33:21.662 --> 01:33:24.733 position:21% line:83% align:start
What do you think of
the world without red?

01:33:24.766 --> 01:33:27.736 position:13% line:89% align:start
Kind of pretty, isn't it?

01:33:27.769 --> 01:33:29.237 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't get the wrong impression.

01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:32.473 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't enjoy doing
barbaric things like this.

01:33:32.507 --> 01:33:35.376 position:5% line:89% align:start
But you left me with no choice.

01:33:35.409 --> 01:33:37.646 position:13% line:83% align:start
You and your friends went
a little too far this time.

01:33:42.784 --> 01:33:44.252 position:13% line:89% align:start
KUSANAGI: What's going on?

01:33:44.285 --> 01:33:46.588 position:21% line:83% align:start
Is this some kind of
joke at my expense?

01:33:46.622 --> 01:33:48.590 position:5% line:83% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: You're giving off
some unpleasant brain waves.

01:33:48.624 --> 01:33:50.425 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why not use my eyes
for the time being?

01:33:53.328 --> 01:33:56.198 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Huh?

01:33:56.231 --> 01:33:58.800 position:21% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: You're the
Laughing Man, aren't you?

01:33:58.834 --> 01:34:00.702 position:13% line:83% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: This is the
third time we've met, you know.

01:34:00.736 --> 01:34:01.670 position:21% line:89% align:start
And let me clarify.

01:34:01.703 --> 01:34:04.473 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm not the one who
came up with that name.

01:34:04.506 --> 01:34:06.141 position:7% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: It was very arrogant
of you to sneak in here,

01:34:06.174 --> 01:34:07.776 position:13% line:89% align:start
not to mention dangerous.

01:34:07.809 --> 01:34:09.177 position:10% line:89% align:start
What did you come here for?

01:34:09.211 --> 01:34:11.446 position:27% line:83% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: To
get you to help me.

01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:14.683 position:7% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: From where I stand,
you've got that backwards.

01:34:14.716 --> 01:34:15.551 position:13% line:89% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: True enough.

01:34:15.584 --> 01:34:17.319 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're not an easy
person to talk to.

01:34:17.352 --> 01:34:19.488 position:21% line:83% align:start
You see, my back is
against the wall,

01:34:19.521 --> 01:34:20.857 position:13% line:83% align:start
and you're the only option
I could come up with.

01:34:20.890 --> 01:34:23.125 position:27% line:83% align:start
I figure if that
son of a bitch God

01:34:23.158 --> 01:34:25.127 position:24% line:83% align:start
hasn't completely
turned his back on me,

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:26.729 position:24% line:83% align:start
you might actually
lend me a hand.

01:34:26.763 --> 01:34:29.197 position:13% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: Blasphemous, and
yet polite at the same time.

01:34:29.231 --> 01:34:32.301 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're awfully full of
yourself, aren't you?

01:34:32.334 --> 01:34:33.502 position:24% line:83% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: I do
what I have to do.

01:34:33.535 --> 01:34:36.305 position:5% line:83% align:start
Failure is out of the question,
because if I don't succeed

01:34:36.338 --> 01:34:39.676 position:7% line:83% align:start
this time, all the phonies in
the world will be legitimized.

01:34:39.709 --> 01:34:41.644 position:7% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: Sounds to me as if
you've hoisted all the problems

01:34:41.678 --> 01:34:43.780 position:24% line:83% align:start
of the world onto
your shoulders.

01:34:43.813 --> 01:34:45.882 position:24% line:83% align:start
So what could the
hero of the net

01:34:45.915 --> 01:34:48.618 position:5% line:89% align:start
possibly want me to do for him?

01:34:48.651 --> 01:34:50.553 position:16% line:83% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: You could
start by listening to me.

01:34:50.587 --> 01:34:52.187 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm going to tell
you the whole story

01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:53.790 position:21% line:83% align:start
behind the Laughing
Man incident.

01:34:53.823 --> 01:34:55.858 position:10% line:83% align:start
After that, I'd like you to
stand back and do nothing

01:34:55.892 --> 01:34:58.328 position:5% line:89% align:start
while I face my final challenge.

01:34:58.361 --> 01:35:01.264 position:19% line:83% align:start
And if by some chance
I should fail and die,

01:35:01.297 --> 01:35:03.833 position:21% line:83% align:start
all I ask of you is
this-- that your people

01:35:03.866 --> 01:35:06.169 position:7% line:89% align:start
bring this incident to light.

01:35:06.202 --> 01:35:07.470 position:16% line:89% align:start
KUSANAGI: Unbelievable.

01:35:07.503 --> 01:35:09.238 position:27% line:89% align:start
All right, fine.

01:35:09.272 --> 01:35:11.274 position:13% line:83% align:start
As your captive audience,
I've listened to your words.

01:35:11.307 --> 01:35:12.875 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now, I have a few for you.

01:35:12.910 --> 01:35:15.812 position:10% line:83% align:start
The mark of an immature man
is that he wants to die nobly

01:35:15.846 --> 01:35:18.414 position:19% line:83% align:start
for a cause, while the
mark of a mature one

01:35:18.448 --> 01:35:20.216 position:21% line:83% align:start
is that he wants to
live humbly for one.

01:35:20.249 --> 01:35:21.852 position:19% line:89% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: Ah, yes.

01:35:21.885 --> 01:35:24.688 position:7% line:83% align:start
Written by the psychoanalyst,
Wilhelm Stekel.

01:35:24.722 --> 01:35:27.725 position:7% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: I sensed this about
you as soon as I met you.

01:35:27.758 --> 01:35:31.427 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's a quality that I dislike
intensely, Mr. Know It All.

01:35:31.461 --> 01:35:33.296 position:10% line:83% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: Seems like you
fall into the same category.

01:35:33.329 --> 01:35:37.635 position:7% line:83% align:start
But all you have to do is ask
for help, and I'd give it.

01:35:37.668 --> 01:35:40.303 position:16% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: Must be hatred
of one's own kind.

01:35:40.336 --> 01:35:40.938 position:41% line:89% align:start
Fine.

01:35:40.971 --> 01:35:42.539 position:13% line:89% align:start
Go do what you have to do.

01:35:42.573 --> 01:35:44.307 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't know if I'll be able
to keep my word, though.

01:35:44.340 --> 01:35:46.577 position:24% line:83% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: If I
know you, you will.

01:35:55.486 --> 01:35:57.788 position:16% line:89% align:start
I leave you my memories.

01:35:57.821 --> 01:35:59.456 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm counting on you.

01:36:11.568 --> 01:36:13.270 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's up to you now.

01:36:22.346 --> 01:36:24.381 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Well, then, as much
as I'll miss you,

01:36:24.415 --> 01:36:27.886 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna let you
die peacefully now.

01:36:27.919 --> 01:36:28.787 position:33% line:89% align:start
The needles.

01:36:47.539 --> 01:36:48.606 position:30% line:89% align:start
-What's that?

01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:51.609 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Don't worry, it's nothing.
BATOU: Chief's calling.

01:36:51.643 --> 01:36:52.977 position:30% line:89% align:start
You done yet?

01:36:53.011 --> 01:36:53.845 position:21% line:89% align:start
KUSANAGI: I am now.

01:36:53.878 --> 01:37:03.321 position:44% line:89% align:start
-Hm.

01:37:24.309 --> 01:37:26.645 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Ishikawa, have any luck
drawing new testimonies out

01:37:26.679 --> 01:37:28.848 position:27% line:83% align:start
of the remaining
narc squad members?

01:37:28.881 --> 01:37:31.617 position:5% line:83% align:start
ISHIKAWA: We weren't able to get
much useful intel out of them.

01:37:31.650 --> 01:37:33.686 position:13% line:83% align:start
And there's the fact that
their boss, Director Niimi,

01:37:33.719 --> 01:37:35.788 position:30% line:83% align:start
just committed
cyberbrain suicide.

01:37:35.821 --> 01:37:38.057 position:21% line:83% align:start
So that lead turned
into a dead end.

01:37:38.090 --> 01:37:42.661 position:10% line:83% align:start
-And we haven't been able to
find the Laughing Man, either.

01:37:42.695 --> 01:37:44.463 position:30% line:89% align:start
-That's true.

01:37:44.497 --> 01:37:46.031 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now, we have a new
set of instructions.

01:37:46.065 --> 01:37:48.701 position:10% line:89% align:start
We're going after this guy.

01:37:48.734 --> 01:37:50.703 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Hey, that's--
-Right.

01:37:50.736 --> 01:37:53.072 position:10% line:83% align:start
Assemblyman Kaoru Yakushima,
standing secretary

01:37:53.105 --> 01:37:55.474 position:5% line:89% align:start
general of the ruling coalition.

01:37:55.508 --> 01:37:56.542 position:13% line:89% align:start
ISHIKAWA: Yakushima, huh?

01:37:56.575 --> 01:37:59.311 position:13% line:83% align:start
He's the most powerful man
in his party right now.

01:37:59.345 --> 01:38:00.813 position:21% line:83% align:start
And he was Minister
of Health at the time

01:38:00.846 --> 01:38:02.548 position:7% line:89% align:start
of the Laughing Man incident.

01:38:02.581 --> 01:38:05.718 position:5% line:83% align:start
BORMA: He's a die hard MHLW man
who built his current position

01:38:05.751 --> 01:38:07.887 position:13% line:83% align:start
by switching jurisdiction
of cyberbrain technology

01:38:07.921 --> 01:38:10.322 position:27% line:83% align:start
from METI to the
Ministry of Health.

01:38:10.356 --> 01:38:11.657 position:24% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: And it's
not widely known,

01:38:11.690 --> 01:38:14.961 position:19% line:83% align:start
but he's got a secret
connection to the JMSDF.

01:38:14.995 --> 01:38:17.831 position:16% line:83% align:start
-So that explains where
that iron suit came from.

01:38:17.864 --> 01:38:20.499 position:21% line:89% align:start
-Yes, that's right.

01:38:20.533 --> 01:38:23.569 position:16% line:83% align:start
When Yakushima was Chief
of Staff for the JMSDF,

01:38:23.602 --> 01:38:26.606 position:5% line:83% align:start
he laid the fat pipeline between
it and the political world.

01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:28.708 position:13% line:83% align:start
He bankrolled this with a
huge sell of stake money

01:38:28.742 --> 01:38:30.744 position:21% line:83% align:start
while he set up shop
as a politician.

01:38:30.777 --> 01:38:33.479 position:13% line:83% align:start
But questions were raised
about his financial sort.

01:38:33.513 --> 01:38:35.447 position:21% line:83% align:start
And the JMSDF's head
accountant accused

01:38:35.482 --> 01:38:37.383 position:5% line:89% align:start
him of embezzling hidden funds.

01:38:37.416 --> 01:38:39.085 position:30% line:83% align:start
Then, the lead
prosecutor in the case

01:38:39.119 --> 01:38:41.488 position:16% line:83% align:start
was found run over next
to a railroad track,

01:38:41.521 --> 01:38:43.690 position:19% line:83% align:start
and the investigation
came to a halt.

01:38:43.723 --> 01:38:45.659 position:16% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: But Yakushima
was never charged.

01:38:45.692 --> 01:38:48.829 position:16% line:83% align:start
So the suspicions about
him are still unresolved.

01:38:48.862 --> 01:38:50.697 position:30% line:89% align:start
There's more.

01:38:50.730 --> 01:38:54.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
Retired Superintendent
Daido was Yakushima's junior

01:38:54.401 --> 01:38:56.703 position:5% line:89% align:start
at the National Defense Academy.

01:38:56.736 --> 01:38:59.973 position:5% line:83% align:start
And words has it that the late
Imakurusu had been a golf buddy

01:39:00.006 --> 01:39:02.609 position:13% line:83% align:start
of Yakushima's ever since
his days as an army medic.

01:39:02.642 --> 01:39:04.444 position:33% line:83% align:start
-What you're
saying, then, Chief,

01:39:04.477 --> 01:39:06.580 position:10% line:83% align:start
is that as far as this chain
of events is concerned,

01:39:06.613 --> 01:39:08.782 position:19% line:83% align:start
our guy here has more
than enough clout

01:39:08.815 --> 01:39:11.018 position:13% line:83% align:start
to be the one pulling the
strings behind it all?

01:39:11.052 --> 01:39:12.954 position:7% line:83% align:start
ARAMAKI: Yes, though we don't
have a shred of evidence

01:39:12.987 --> 01:39:14.155 position:30% line:89% align:start
at this point.

01:39:14.188 --> 01:39:15.990 position:27% line:83% align:start
-So then, how do
you plan on going

01:39:16.023 --> 01:39:17.992 position:10% line:89% align:start
after the Secretary General?

01:39:18.025 --> 01:39:20.027 position:13% line:83% align:start
-We're going to tug on the
last thread we've got left

01:39:20.061 --> 01:39:23.396 position:13% line:83% align:start
that connects Yakushima to
the Laughing Man incident.

01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:25.633 position:24% line:89% align:start
-Serano Genomics.

01:39:25.666 --> 01:39:26.801 position:30% line:89% align:start
-That's right.

01:39:26.834 --> 01:39:29.436 position:10% line:83% align:start
The suppression of the Murai
vaccine, which we believe

01:39:29.469 --> 01:39:31.172 position:16% line:83% align:start
to be the origin of the
Laughing Man affair,

01:39:31.205 --> 01:39:33.541 position:24% line:83% align:start
and Serano's micro
machine therapy, which

01:39:33.574 --> 01:39:35.743 position:24% line:83% align:start
received approval
at the same time.

01:39:35.776 --> 01:39:38.446 position:13% line:83% align:start
Ernest Serano seems up to
his neck in both, which

01:39:38.479 --> 01:39:40.448 position:24% line:83% align:start
is why we want to
take him into custody.

01:39:40.481 --> 01:39:42.783 position:24% line:83% align:start
If we can question
him immediately,

01:39:42.817 --> 01:39:44.986 position:21% line:83% align:start
then the link should
become evident.

01:39:45.019 --> 01:39:47.655 position:30% line:83% align:start
Ever since the
incident six years ago,

01:39:47.688 --> 01:39:49.490 position:19% line:83% align:start
he's been under house
arrest, though they

01:39:49.523 --> 01:39:50.892 position:13% line:89% align:start
call it police protection.

01:39:50.925 --> 01:39:52.560 position:19% line:89% align:start
So use whatever means.

01:39:52.593 --> 01:39:54.528 position:19% line:83% align:start
Take him into custody
no matter what.

01:39:54.562 --> 01:39:55.963 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Well, the Laughing
Man is probably

01:39:55.997 --> 01:39:57.498 position:16% line:89% align:start
thinking the same thing.

01:39:57.531 --> 01:39:58.833 position:16% line:89% align:start
Suppose we run into him.

01:39:58.866 --> 01:40:00.835 position:35% line:89% align:start
What then?

01:40:00.868 --> 01:40:02.070 position:27% line:89% align:start
-You arrest him.

01:40:02.104 --> 01:40:04.906 position:7% line:83% align:start
He's not only a prime suspect
in this case, but in a way,

01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:06.874 position:13% line:89% align:start
he's also the key witness.

01:40:06.909 --> 01:40:08.709 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Aren't you worried
that Serano might get

01:40:08.743 --> 01:40:10.444 position:27% line:83% align:start
bumped off once
we go into action,

01:40:10.478 --> 01:40:11.746 position:13% line:89% align:start
like what happened before?

01:40:11.779 --> 01:40:13.681 position:16% line:89% align:start
-That is a possibility.

01:40:13.714 --> 01:40:15.716 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's why I don't
care how you get him.

01:40:27.195 --> 01:40:28.897 position:41% line:89% align:start
[bell]

01:40:28.931 --> 01:40:31.833 position:13% line:83% align:start
MAN: Mr. Serano, it looks
like your car's arrived, sir.

01:40:31.867 --> 01:40:33.936 position:38% line:83% align:start
-I see.
Thank you.

01:40:33.969 --> 01:40:35.237 position:24% line:83% align:start
MAN: I'll be right
up to accompany you.

01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:38.140 position:10% line:89% align:start
Please wait there a moment.

01:40:38.173 --> 01:40:39.141 position:41% line:89% align:start
[bell]

01:40:52.721 --> 01:40:53.989 position:35% line:89% align:start
[knocking]

01:40:54.022 --> 01:40:54.957 position:21% line:89% align:start
Come in, it's open.

01:41:14.077 --> 01:41:17.246 position:5% line:89% align:start
-The subject has left his room.

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:18.715 position:5% line:89% align:start
He's heading for the entry hall.

01:41:25.955 --> 01:41:27.190 position:19% line:89% align:start
-Morning, Mr. Serano.

01:41:27.223 --> 01:41:28.124 position:30% line:89% align:start
-Good morning.

01:41:31.594 --> 01:41:35.765 position:7% line:89% align:start
-Now opening entry hall door.

01:41:35.798 --> 01:41:37.300 position:21% line:89% align:start
-You take care, sir.

01:41:37.333 --> 01:41:39.569 position:33% line:89% align:start
-Thank you.

01:41:39.602 --> 01:41:41.204 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Subject is through
the entry hall.

01:41:41.237 --> 01:41:41.938 position:21% line:89% align:start
OFFICER: Roger that.

01:41:41.971 --> 01:41:43.539 position:27% line:89% align:start
We have visual.

01:41:57.154 --> 01:41:58.888 position:19% line:83% align:start
SERANO: It's just like
last time, isn't it?

01:42:02.092 --> 01:42:03.027 position:10% line:89% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: You're right.

01:42:03.060 --> 01:42:04.627 position:21% line:83% align:start
The only difference
now is the detectives

01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:08.065 position:27% line:83% align:start
were in the hall
instead of your family.

01:42:08.098 --> 01:42:10.700 position:24% line:83% align:start
There wasn't a car
following us, either.

01:42:10.733 --> 01:42:12.936 position:30% line:83% align:start
-So, what will
you do about them?

01:42:12.970 --> 01:42:16.106 position:7% line:89% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: Well, let's see.

01:42:16.140 --> 01:42:18.976 position:21% line:83% align:start
Driver, turn left at
the next intersection,

01:42:19.009 --> 01:42:19.710 position:24% line:89% align:start
would you, please?

01:42:24.014 --> 01:42:25.115 position:16% line:89% align:start
-Something's not right.

01:42:25.149 --> 01:42:26.183 position:19% line:89% align:start
-Just don't lose him.

01:42:26.216 --> 01:42:35.292 position:16% line:89% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: It'll take

01:42:35.325 --> 01:42:38.228 position:19% line:83% align:start
about an hour to reach
Serano Genomics' head office.

01:42:38.262 --> 01:42:40.964 position:24% line:83% align:start
In the meantime, I
want you to tell me

01:42:40.998 --> 01:42:42.800 position:21% line:83% align:start
why you haven't kept
your word and why you've

01:42:42.833 --> 01:42:45.002 position:21% line:83% align:start
stayed silent these
past six years.

01:42:45.035 --> 01:42:49.039 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have to decide on my
next course of action.

01:42:49.073 --> 01:42:50.341 position:13% line:89% align:start
-You're awfully audacious.

01:42:59.284 --> 01:43:00.751 position:35% line:89% align:start
-Hold it!

01:43:00.784 --> 01:43:02.320 position:19% line:83% align:start
Put your hands on the
hood of the car now!

01:43:02.353 --> 01:43:04.322 position:21% line:89% align:start
-Take it easy, boys.

01:43:04.355 --> 01:43:05.856 position:13% line:89% align:start
-We contacted you earlier.

01:43:05.890 --> 01:43:07.859 position:5% line:89% align:start
We're Public Security Section 9.

01:43:07.892 --> 01:43:10.195 position:21% line:83% align:start
I was told that Mr.
Serano had already gone.

01:43:10.228 --> 01:43:11.896 position:30% line:83% align:start
Is that true?
-Yes.

01:43:11.930 --> 01:43:14.032 position:19% line:83% align:start
His usual ride to the
office left, same as always.

01:43:14.065 --> 01:43:14.933 position:30% line:89% align:start
What about it?

01:43:14.966 --> 01:43:15.967 position:21% line:89% align:start
-Look at your watch.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.704 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is that the usual
time he leaves?

01:43:19.737 --> 01:43:21.873 position:10% line:83% align:start
Gee whiz, your boss sure is
one helluva a hard worker,

01:43:21.906 --> 01:43:23.942 position:35% line:83% align:start
ain't he?
Here's a bulletin.

01:43:23.975 --> 01:43:25.143 position:27% line:83% align:start
Every single one
of you dumbasses

01:43:25.176 --> 01:43:26.811 position:13% line:89% align:start
just had your eyes hacked.

01:43:30.915 --> 01:43:32.083 position:24% line:89% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: Wow.

01:43:32.117 --> 01:43:35.286 position:7% line:83% align:start
The view from here has really
changed a lot, hasn't it?

01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:38.357 position:10% line:83% align:start
And I've noticed your hair's
gone white, Mr. Serano.

01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:40.292 position:24% line:83% align:start
SERANO: It's been
a rough six years.

01:43:40.326 --> 01:43:41.926 position:24% line:83% align:start
The official story
is that the police

01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:44.095 position:16% line:83% align:start
are around to protect me
against threats from you.

01:43:44.129 --> 01:43:46.198 position:16% line:83% align:start
But they're really there
to keep an eye on me,

01:43:46.232 --> 01:43:48.200 position:30% line:83% align:start
to make sure I
don't blab anything

01:43:48.234 --> 01:43:50.935 position:19% line:83% align:start
about the truth behind
the infamous incident.

01:43:50.969 --> 01:43:53.339 position:7% line:83% align:start
For all intents and purposes,
I'm under house arrest.

01:43:53.372 --> 01:43:55.707 position:19% line:83% align:start
Compared to back then,
you've changed, too.

01:43:55.740 --> 01:43:57.709 position:13% line:89% align:start
You've lost your naivete.

01:43:57.742 --> 01:44:00.745 position:19% line:83% align:start
-I guess I've managed
to mature a little.

01:44:00.778 --> 01:44:02.680 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll confess that
in those days, I

01:44:02.714 --> 01:44:04.749 position:13% line:83% align:start
wanted so bad to give all
the phonies in the world

01:44:04.782 --> 01:44:06.952 position:7% line:89% align:start
a good, swift kick in the ass.

01:44:06.986 --> 01:44:08.786 position:24% line:83% align:start
By the same token,
you were something

01:44:08.821 --> 01:44:10.456 position:16% line:89% align:start
of a wild guy yourself.

01:44:10.489 --> 01:44:12.724 position:16% line:83% align:start
For two whole days, you
hung out with a student

01:44:12.758 --> 01:44:15.194 position:10% line:89% align:start
who was an anonymous nobody.

01:44:15.227 --> 01:44:17.163 position:10% line:83% align:start
You did that in spite of the
fact that he hacked into you

01:44:17.196 --> 01:44:20.099 position:21% line:83% align:start
and was brain diving
the entire time.

01:44:20.132 --> 01:44:22.001 position:21% line:83% align:start
-I still had enough
unjaded passion

01:44:22.034 --> 01:44:24.036 position:19% line:83% align:start
left in me to want to
debate a student who

01:44:24.069 --> 01:44:26.772 position:16% line:83% align:start
sanctimoniously spouted
his unworldly crap.

01:44:31.410 --> 01:44:34.113 position:13% line:83% align:start
I understand what you're
saying, but I'm a micro machine

01:44:34.146 --> 01:44:36.916 position:13% line:83% align:start
developer, not a member of
the Drug Evaluation Council.

01:44:36.949 --> 01:44:38.017 position:30% line:89% align:start
You know that.

01:44:38.050 --> 01:44:39.885 position:16% line:83% align:start
I had nothing to do with
the Murai vaccine rejection.

01:44:39.919 --> 01:44:40.719 position:7% line:89% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: I realize that.

01:44:40.753 --> 01:44:42.422 position:33% line:83% align:start
But the Drug
Evaluation Council is

01:44:42.455 --> 01:44:43.989 position:7% line:89% align:start
bunch of assholes and phonies.

01:44:44.023 --> 01:44:46.158 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll be forced to
confront them someday.

01:44:46.193 --> 01:44:48.295 position:19% line:83% align:start
First, however, I want
you to publicly disclose

01:44:48.328 --> 01:44:51.331 position:13% line:83% align:start
the data showing that your
company's micro machines have

01:44:51.364 --> 01:44:54.201 position:19% line:83% align:start
practically no effect
on cyberbrain sclerosis.

01:44:54.234 --> 01:44:56.236 position:21% line:83% align:start
-That's something I
can't do, and I've

01:44:56.269 --> 01:44:57.537 position:10% line:89% align:start
told you that over and over.

01:44:57.571 --> 01:45:00.207 position:5% line:83% align:start
I do admit that some of what you
wrote in your blackmail letter

01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:01.441 position:13% line:89% align:start
three years ago was valid.

01:45:01.474 --> 01:45:04.311 position:7% line:83% align:start
No one could argue that micro
machine therapy was anything

01:45:04.344 --> 01:45:06.513 position:13% line:83% align:start
more than a theory at that
stage of its development.

01:45:06.546 --> 01:45:09.382 position:16% line:83% align:start
But that's precisely how
the patent process works.

01:45:09.416 --> 01:45:12.319 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's not a crime to be the first
to register a technology that's

01:45:12.352 --> 01:45:14.421 position:19% line:83% align:start
certain to have future
practical applications.

01:45:14.454 --> 01:45:15.422 position:13% line:89% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: Oh, please.

01:45:15.455 --> 01:45:17.457 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's something some
damn lawyer would say.

01:45:17.490 --> 01:45:19.125 position:27% line:89% align:start
Son of a bitch.

01:45:19.159 --> 01:45:20.927 position:44% line:89% align:start
-OK.

01:45:20.961 --> 01:45:23.363 position:13% line:83% align:start
I was well aware that our
approval request was premature.

01:45:23.396 --> 01:45:26.233 position:7% line:83% align:start
You see, it was actually meant
in part to serve as a bluff

01:45:26.266 --> 01:45:29.202 position:21% line:89% align:start
to our competitors.

01:45:29.236 --> 01:45:33.206 position:10% line:83% align:start
But I believe they realize
that our theories are superior.

01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:36.176 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's why the Drug Evaluation
Council gave us approval

01:45:36.209 --> 01:45:37.978 position:27% line:83% align:start
within the short
span of three months.

01:45:38.011 --> 01:45:40.348 position:16% line:83% align:start
You've not comprehension
of the scale of damage

01:45:40.381 --> 01:45:41.549 position:24% line:83% align:start
that would result
from people losing

01:45:41.582 --> 01:45:43.883 position:5% line:89% align:start
faith in medical micro machines.

01:45:43.917 --> 01:45:45.553 position:27% line:83% align:start
This is cutting
edge technology that

01:45:45.586 --> 01:45:47.388 position:10% line:83% align:start
has a measurable potential,
and you're attempting to--

01:45:47.421 --> 01:45:49.089 position:21% line:83% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: You're
not listening.

01:45:49.123 --> 01:45:52.560 position:7% line:83% align:start
What I'm trying to say is that
it's a matter of life or death

01:45:52.593 --> 01:45:53.494 position:27% line:83% align:start
for those people
who are suffering

01:45:53.527 --> 01:45:55.363 position:13% line:89% align:start
from cyberbrain sclerosis.

01:45:55.396 --> 01:45:58.132 position:10% line:83% align:start
At the very least, can't you
concede the effectiveness

01:45:58.165 --> 01:46:00.368 position:13% line:83% align:start
of the Murai vaccine until
micro machine therapy

01:46:00.401 --> 01:46:01.835 position:24% line:83% align:start
finally turns out
some clear results?

01:46:01.868 --> 01:46:03.471 position:24% line:83% align:start
-I have absolutely
nothing whatsoever

01:46:03.504 --> 01:46:05.006 position:16% line:89% align:start
to say regarding Murai.

01:46:05.039 --> 01:46:06.941 position:19% line:83% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: How can
you honestly say that?

01:46:06.974 --> 01:46:09.577 position:21% line:83% align:start
If that sick-humored
son of a bitch God

01:46:09.610 --> 01:46:12.046 position:21% line:83% align:start
gave you cyberbrain
sclerosis for sheer kicks,

01:46:12.079 --> 01:46:14.048 position:19% line:83% align:start
would you choose micro
machine treatment hands down

01:46:14.081 --> 01:46:16.017 position:24% line:83% align:start
without giving it
a second thought?

01:46:16.050 --> 01:46:16.884 position:27% line:89% align:start
-Yes, of course.

01:46:16.917 --> 01:46:18.853 position:27% line:83% align:start
I have faith and
pride in every product

01:46:18.886 --> 01:46:20.254 position:5% line:89% align:start
that's manufactured by my firm.

01:46:20.288 --> 01:46:22.089 position:19% line:83% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: So then,
you'd even choose it

01:46:22.123 --> 01:46:24.892 position:21% line:83% align:start
for your children if
they came down with CS?

01:46:24.925 --> 01:46:27.194 position:10% line:89% align:start
-Uh, yes, I suppose I would.

01:46:27.228 --> 01:46:29.330 position:19% line:83% align:start
Listen, let's get off
this hypothetical track.

01:46:29.363 --> 01:46:33.402 position:30% line:89% align:start
LAUGHING MAN:

01:46:33.435 --> 01:46:35.537 position:24% line:83% align:start
are two different
things, aren't they?

01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:37.439 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's not fair, Mr. Serano.

01:46:37.472 --> 01:46:40.275 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you're really so proud
of micro machine therapy,

01:46:40.309 --> 01:46:41.942 position:16% line:83% align:start
you should exploit your
position and influence

01:46:41.976 --> 01:46:45.079 position:19% line:89% align:start
to do the right thing.

01:46:45.112 --> 01:46:46.914 position:16% line:83% align:start
The best that Imakurusu
could come up with

01:46:46.947 --> 01:46:48.383 position:24% line:83% align:start
was to reject the
vaccine that had

01:46:48.417 --> 01:46:50.218 position:5% line:89% align:start
Dr. Murai's name attached to it.

01:46:50.252 --> 01:46:53.155 position:16% line:83% align:start
The damn Drug Evaluation
Council had only one job--

01:46:53.188 --> 01:46:55.223 position:13% line:83% align:start
to merely rubber stamp any
new medicine that passed

01:46:55.257 --> 01:46:56.191 position:5% line:89% align:start
through the Ministry of Health.

01:46:56.224 --> 01:46:58.560 position:21% line:83% align:start
But Imakurusu, a man
who had stance specially

01:46:58.593 --> 01:47:02.030 position:5% line:83% align:start
made to reject the Murai vaccine
which read approval denied,

01:47:02.064 --> 01:47:04.466 position:21% line:89% align:start
shared that council.

01:47:04.499 --> 01:47:06.234 position:13% line:89% align:start
And hey, what do you know?

01:47:06.268 --> 01:47:09.237 position:10% line:83% align:start
Your own micro machines were
used in that dirty deal.

01:47:09.271 --> 01:47:11.039 position:21% line:83% align:start
You can't be totally
oblivious to the circumstances

01:47:11.073 --> 01:47:13.875 position:27% line:83% align:start
surrounding this
situation, Mr. Serano.

01:47:13.909 --> 01:47:16.578 position:5% line:83% align:start
It didn't matter a rat's ass to
them if it was your technology

01:47:16.612 --> 01:47:18.347 position:38% line:89% align:start
or not.

01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:19.948 position:10% line:83% align:start
Any damn micro machine that
happened to be up for approval

01:47:19.981 --> 01:47:22.518 position:27% line:83% align:start
back then would
have fit the bill.

01:47:22.552 --> 01:47:25.954 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you know how corrupt this
shitty medical industry is you

01:47:25.987 --> 01:47:27.189 position:27% line:83% align:start
honestly tell me
that none of this

01:47:27.222 --> 01:47:28.323 position:10% line:89% align:start
has anything to do with you?

01:47:28.357 --> 01:47:32.928 position:33% line:89% align:start
-All right.

01:47:32.961 --> 01:47:34.464 position:16% line:89% align:start
I propose a compromise.

01:47:34.497 --> 01:47:36.599 position:19% line:83% align:start
For now, let me go so
I can act on my own.

01:47:36.632 --> 01:47:39.369 position:7% line:83% align:start
Once I've done that, I'll make
the necessary preparations.

01:47:39.402 --> 01:47:41.571 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll organize a press
conference and disclose

01:47:41.604 --> 01:47:44.005 position:21% line:83% align:start
the current state of
micro machine therapy?

01:47:44.039 --> 01:47:46.242 position:21% line:83% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: What?
Are you serious?

01:47:46.275 --> 01:47:48.944 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's no advantage
for you in that promise.

01:47:48.977 --> 01:47:51.913 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Contrary to what you
believe, I'm not so petty.

01:47:51.947 --> 01:47:53.416 position:27% line:83% align:start
Perhaps it's not
as grand as yours,

01:47:53.449 --> 01:47:55.284 position:27% line:83% align:start
but my sense of
social justice is

01:47:55.318 --> 01:47:57.487 position:16% line:83% align:start
alive and well and equal
to that of anyone else.

01:47:57.520 --> 01:47:58.421 position:16% line:89% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: I wonder.

01:47:58.454 --> 01:47:59.255 position:27% line:89% align:start
-I promise you.

01:48:06.362 --> 01:48:08.531 position:10% line:83% align:start
SERANO: At the time, I was
exhausted from your brain dive,

01:48:08.564 --> 01:48:10.666 position:21% line:83% align:start
so I fervently made
that process to you

01:48:10.701 --> 01:48:12.335 position:13% line:89% align:start
in the hopes of escaping.

01:48:12.368 --> 01:48:15.037 position:13% line:83% align:start
I thought that if I could
just get you in front of a TV

01:48:15.071 --> 01:48:17.240 position:21% line:83% align:start
camera, the eyes of
the viewing public,

01:48:17.273 --> 01:48:20.577 position:5% line:89% align:start
you wouldn't do anything crazy.

01:48:20.611 --> 01:48:21.944 position:10% line:89% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: That's right.

01:48:21.978 --> 01:48:23.946 position:24% line:83% align:start
But unfortunately,
I was packing an S&amp;W

01:48:23.980 --> 01:48:25.314 position:10% line:89% align:start
chief special in my pocket.

01:48:28.351 --> 01:48:31.588 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Well, are you going to
disengage this brain dive?

01:48:31.622 --> 01:48:33.424 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're breaking the
law by doing this.

01:48:33.457 --> 01:48:35.726 position:19% line:83% align:start
An informed individual
like you should know that.

01:48:35.759 --> 01:48:38.194 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you want to keep your
anonymity and hide your face,

01:48:38.228 --> 01:48:42.466 position:10% line:83% align:start
then it wouldn't be a great
idea to be shown on TV.

01:48:42.499 --> 01:48:43.467 position:35% line:89% align:start
[grunting]

01:48:47.204 --> 01:48:49.206 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've actually enjoyed
our vigorous debates.

01:48:49.239 --> 01:48:51.475 position:16% line:83% align:start
But as a man who has to
protect his enterprises,

01:48:51.508 --> 01:48:54.311 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid I might not
be able to honor my word.

01:48:54.344 --> 01:48:57.981 position:16% line:83% align:start
Society isn't as cut and
dried as you seem to imagine.

01:48:58.015 --> 01:48:59.550 position:24% line:83% align:start
However, I have no
intention of trying

01:48:59.583 --> 01:49:01.285 position:7% line:89% align:start
to uncover who you really are.

01:49:01.318 --> 01:49:02.986 position:19% line:83% align:start
Let's go our separate
ways from here.

01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:09.626 position:24% line:89% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: No!

01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:11.094 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's not fair!

01:49:14.565 --> 01:49:16.567 position:24% line:89% align:start
[woman screaming]

01:49:16.601 --> 01:49:17.534 position:21% line:89% align:start
MAN: He's got a gun!

01:49:17.569 --> 01:49:18.502 position:19% line:89% align:start
MAN: Call the police!

01:49:18.535 --> 01:49:21.138 position:24% line:89% align:start
[crowd clamoring]

01:49:21.171 --> 01:49:22.607 position:5% line:89% align:start
-Look straight into that camera.

01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:24.542 position:24% line:83% align:start
I demand you tell
the world the truth.

01:49:24.576 --> 01:49:26.109 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Listen.
Stop.

01:49:26.143 --> 01:49:28.212 position:21% line:83% align:start
You won't shoot me.
-Are you sure?

01:49:38.356 --> 01:49:40.458 position:13% line:83% align:start
-And what followed was the
micro machine killer virus

01:49:40.492 --> 01:49:42.660 position:27% line:83% align:start
outbreak at your
production plant.

01:49:42.694 --> 01:49:44.195 position:30% line:89% align:start
-That's right.

01:49:44.229 --> 01:49:45.763 position:19% line:83% align:start
At the same time that
I was angry at myself

01:49:45.797 --> 01:49:48.099 position:16% line:83% align:start
for feeling overjoyed by
our micro machine treatment

01:49:48.132 --> 01:49:49.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
receiving approval,
I was cursing

01:49:49.567 --> 01:49:52.303 position:5% line:89% align:start
you from the bottom of my heart.

01:49:52.337 --> 01:49:55.607 position:5% line:83% align:start
I thought it was just corporate
terrorism plain and simple.

01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:56.808 position:27% line:89% align:start
But I was wrong.

01:49:56.841 --> 01:49:58.676 position:16% line:89% align:start
That wasn't you, was it?

01:49:58.710 --> 01:50:02.080 position:10% line:83% align:start
A word of wisdom-- the evil
that lurks in this world

01:50:02.113 --> 01:50:03.681 position:24% line:83% align:start
exists on a level
that's far greater

01:50:03.715 --> 01:50:06.684 position:10% line:89% align:start
than we could ever envision.

01:50:06.718 --> 01:50:09.420 position:5% line:83% align:start
I assume you're aware that our
company was granted an infusion

01:50:09.454 --> 01:50:11.389 position:16% line:83% align:start
of public funds because
we were teetering

01:50:11.422 --> 01:50:13.424 position:10% line:83% align:start
on the brink of bankruptcy,
thanks to being blackmailed

01:50:13.458 --> 01:50:16.528 position:13% line:83% align:start
and the damages caused by
the killer virus outbreak.

01:50:16.562 --> 01:50:19.430 position:21% line:83% align:start
Let me tell you what
happened afterwards.

01:50:19.464 --> 01:50:21.332 position:21% line:83% align:start
Right when our stock
prices were gradually

01:50:21.366 --> 01:50:24.436 position:16% line:83% align:start
beginning to climb back
up after their collapse,

01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:27.071 position:13% line:83% align:start
we were paid a visit by a
man who introduced himself

01:50:27.105 --> 01:50:28.474 position:24% line:83% align:start
as a member of the
private support

01:50:28.507 --> 01:50:30.776 position:27% line:83% align:start
association of a
certain assemblyman.

01:50:30.809 --> 01:50:33.077 position:7% line:83% align:start
He said that he was acquainted
with someone who could put

01:50:33.111 --> 01:50:35.113 position:30% line:83% align:start
an end to the
corporate blackmail.

01:50:35.146 --> 01:50:36.382 position:19% line:83% align:start
And in the event that
this person solved

01:50:36.415 --> 01:50:39.318 position:7% line:83% align:start
their little problem, he asked
if we would be willing to make

01:50:39.351 --> 01:50:43.556 position:16% line:83% align:start
a political contribution
to this assemblyman.

01:50:43.589 --> 01:50:46.225 position:10% line:83% align:start
The amount he suggested was
equivalent to the public funds

01:50:46.258 --> 01:50:49.528 position:24% line:83% align:start
plus the demanded
blackmail money.

01:50:49.562 --> 01:50:52.298 position:5% line:83% align:start
This obviously meant that Serano
Genomics had been targeted

01:50:52.331 --> 01:50:55.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
for a shakedown all along,
just because we were

01:50:55.367 --> 01:50:57.436 position:21% line:83% align:start
latecomer among the
other manufacturers.

01:50:57.469 --> 01:50:59.238 position:16% line:83% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: They must
have considered my stunt

01:50:59.271 --> 01:51:00.406 position:21% line:83% align:start
to be a performance
that couldn't

01:51:00.439 --> 01:51:02.174 position:27% line:83% align:start
have been staged
at a better time.

01:51:02.207 --> 01:51:04.176 position:10% line:89% align:start
SERANO: I suppose they did.

01:51:04.209 --> 01:51:07.146 position:10% line:83% align:start
And by continuing to imitate
the incident you carried out,

01:51:07.179 --> 01:51:10.382 position:10% line:83% align:start
they created a fake persona
called the Laughing Man.

01:51:10.416 --> 01:51:12.752 position:19% line:83% align:start
They manipulated stock
prices by invoking

01:51:12.786 --> 01:51:14.520 position:30% line:83% align:start
the name of a
nonexistent criminal,

01:51:14.553 --> 01:51:17.356 position:13% line:83% align:start
stealing money from other
companies as well as us.

01:51:17.389 --> 01:51:19.191 position:10% line:83% align:start
The greedy bastards did this
even though they'd probably

01:51:19.224 --> 01:51:20.860 position:24% line:83% align:start
been making a tiny
sum before that

01:51:20.894 --> 01:51:22.862 position:10% line:89% align:start
by shortselling the stocks.

01:51:22.896 --> 01:51:27.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Was this assemblyman
Secretary General Yakushima?

01:51:27.601 --> 01:51:29.536 position:16% line:89% align:start
-Then you already knew?

01:51:29.569 --> 01:51:31.538 position:27% line:83% align:start
-A basic rule of
thumb about hackers

01:51:31.571 --> 01:51:34.206 position:10% line:83% align:start
is that we live to peek at
things that others keep hidden.

01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:36.576 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's our nature.

01:51:36.610 --> 01:51:40.280 position:13% line:83% align:start
But the depth of darkness
in the hotbed of corruption

01:51:40.313 --> 01:51:42.382 position:27% line:83% align:start
that I tried to
challenge defeated me.

01:51:42.415 --> 01:51:44.351 position:24% line:83% align:start
And all I could do
was become a deaf-mute

01:51:44.384 --> 01:51:46.653 position:7% line:89% align:start
and avert my eyes from it all.

01:51:46.686 --> 01:51:48.622 position:21% line:83% align:start
Just as you've done
these past six years.

01:51:51.691 --> 01:51:55.662 position:7% line:83% align:start
The Laughing Man-- that was a
catchy name they came up with.

01:51:55.695 --> 01:51:57.297 position:24% line:83% align:start
And here, I'd been
thinking that if I

01:51:57.330 --> 01:51:58.933 position:27% line:83% align:start
was unsuccessful
in persuading you,

01:51:58.966 --> 01:52:03.403 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'd simply follow Holden's
quote and disappear.

01:52:03.436 --> 01:52:05.572 position:24% line:83% align:start
They went with the
Salinger angle, too.

01:52:05.605 --> 01:52:08.909 position:21% line:89% align:start
I can't believe it.

01:52:08.943 --> 01:52:12.178 position:19% line:83% align:start
Mr. Serano, if that's
what they're up to,

01:52:12.212 --> 01:52:13.881 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll have to become the
original Laughing Man

01:52:13.914 --> 01:52:16.584 position:7% line:83% align:start
and drag that phony Yakushima
into the light of day.

01:52:16.617 --> 01:52:18.351 position:27% line:83% align:start
-It was when you
revealed yourself

01:52:18.385 --> 01:52:20.755 position:5% line:89% align:start
that I made up my mind as well.

01:52:20.788 --> 01:52:22.355 position:27% line:83% align:start
There isn't much
evidence, so it's

01:52:22.389 --> 01:52:24.458 position:16% line:83% align:start
going to be a difficult
job to accuse him.

01:52:24.492 --> 01:52:26.894 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'll even become your copycat
in order to bring him down.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.469 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Just try not to die before
you take the witness stand.

01:52:40.441 --> 01:52:43.911 position:21% line:83% align:start
BATOU: That was one
hell of an acting job.

01:52:43.944 --> 01:52:45.012 position:27% line:83% align:start
Boy, with chops
like that, you could

01:52:45.047 --> 01:52:47.381 position:5% line:83% align:start
fool anybody no trouble at all.
LAUGHING MAN: Hm.

01:52:47.415 --> 01:52:48.416 position:44% line:89% align:start
Gee.

01:52:48.449 --> 01:52:50.551 position:21% line:83% align:start
And I was never in a
single school play either.

01:52:56.892 --> 01:52:58.994 position:19% line:83% align:start
-So did you manage to
confirm the connection

01:52:59.027 --> 01:53:01.295 position:7% line:83% align:start
between Yakushima and Serano?
-Yeah.

01:53:01.328 --> 01:53:03.297 position:24% line:83% align:start
And to his credit,
all the information

01:53:03.330 --> 01:53:05.466 position:27% line:83% align:start
the Laughing Man
gave me was true.

01:53:05.499 --> 01:53:08.502 position:27% line:83% align:start
This should jolt
Mr. Serano, as well.

01:53:08.536 --> 01:53:09.771 position:33% line:89% align:start
Could work.

01:53:09.805 --> 01:53:12.440 position:38% line:89% align:start
[sirens]

01:53:34.696 --> 01:53:36.832 position:10% line:89% align:start
TOGUSA: Reporting for duty.

01:53:36.865 --> 01:53:38.366 position:30% line:83% align:start
-I thought you
hadn't been cleared

01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:39.334 position:13% line:89% align:start
to leave the hospital yet.

01:53:39.367 --> 01:53:40.001 position:35% line:89% align:start
-Come on.

01:53:40.035 --> 01:53:41.336 position:27% line:89% align:start
Lay off, Major.

01:53:41.369 --> 01:53:42.938 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't be the only
one of the crew

01:53:42.971 --> 01:53:44.940 position:27% line:83% align:start
to lay in bed at
a time like this.

01:53:44.973 --> 01:53:47.909 position:5% line:89% align:start
-I decided to bring Togusa back.

01:53:47.943 --> 01:53:49.311 position:10% line:89% align:start
I've done all the paperwork.

01:53:49.344 --> 01:53:50.812 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're going to
be coming with me

01:53:50.846 --> 01:53:52.781 position:33% line:83% align:start
to the prime
minister's residence.

01:53:52.814 --> 01:53:53.782 position:38% line:89% align:start
-Right.

01:53:53.815 --> 01:53:55.017 position:16% line:89% align:start
BATOU: You gonna be OK?

01:53:55.051 --> 01:53:56.886 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're not back to 100% yet.

01:53:56.919 --> 01:53:58.520 position:24% line:89% align:start
-I cant handle it.

01:53:58.553 --> 01:53:59.321 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Mmhm.

01:53:59.354 --> 01:54:00.555 position:24% line:83% align:start
After all, it was
Togusa who first

01:54:00.589 --> 01:54:01.991 position:13% line:89% align:start
found out about this case.

01:54:02.024 --> 01:54:03.726 position:21% line:89% align:start
You should be on it.

01:54:08.698 --> 01:54:09.732 position:30% line:83% align:start
WOMAN: Chief?
ARAMAKI: Yes.

01:54:09.766 --> 01:54:10.833 position:27% line:83% align:start
WOMAN: You have
an emergency call

01:54:10.867 --> 01:54:13.435 position:19% line:83% align:start
from the Home Affairs
Minister, sir.

01:54:13.468 --> 01:54:14.704 position:21% line:83% align:start
ARAMAKI: All right.
Put him through.

01:54:17.507 --> 01:54:18.474 position:13% line:89% align:start
-Aramaki, this is serious.

01:54:18.508 --> 01:54:21.477 position:16% line:83% align:start
Are you watching Channel
double three right now?

01:54:21.511 --> 01:54:25.615 position:33% line:83% align:start
ARAMAKI: No.
CHIEF: Then turn it on, quickly.

01:54:25.648 --> 01:54:27.483 position:7% line:83% align:start
REPORTER: And now, suspicions
have surfaced about the members

01:54:27.517 --> 01:54:29.719 position:30% line:83% align:start
of the Public
Security Section 9.

01:54:29.752 --> 01:54:32.321 position:10% line:5% align:start
This armed group, under the
direct control of the Ministry

01:54:32.355 --> 01:54:34.056 position:21% line:5% align:start
of Home Affairs, is
believed to have had a hand

01:54:34.090 --> 01:54:35.558 position:27% line:5% align:start
in the attempted
kidnapping of Ernest

01:54:35.591 --> 01:54:38.327 position:5% line:5% align:start
Serano, CEO of Serano Genomics.

01:54:38.361 --> 01:54:40.329 position:16% line:5% align:start
Labeled an international
rescue team,

01:54:40.363 --> 01:54:43.566 position:5% line:5% align:start
Section 9 was formed by the MHA,
but their excessive information

01:54:43.599 --> 01:54:45.635 position:19% line:5% align:start
gathering use of force
under their own authority

01:54:45.668 --> 01:54:47.470 position:30% line:5% align:start
have long been
viewed with concern.

01:54:47.503 --> 01:54:49.705 position:16% line:83% align:start
This event also strongly
suggests that Section 9 was

01:54:49.739 --> 01:54:54.111 position:10% line:83% align:start
involved in the 2024 string
of Laughing Man incidents.

01:54:54.144 --> 01:54:55.112 position:38% line:89% align:start
-Major.

01:54:55.145 --> 01:54:57.413 position:24% line:5% align:start
-We're calling an
emergency cabinet session.

01:54:57.446 --> 01:54:58.816 position:27% line:5% align:start
Look what you've
got me mixed up in.

01:54:58.849 --> 01:55:01.350 position:24% line:5% align:start
I want you to get
over here, too.

01:55:01.384 --> 01:55:03.053 position:7% line:5% align:start
In the meantime, you'd better
think about what you're

01:55:03.086 --> 01:55:05.956 position:21% line:5% align:start
going to say to them
in your defense.

01:55:05.989 --> 01:55:07.691 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Our intel was
leaked before the op.

01:55:07.724 --> 01:55:09.059 position:7% line:89% align:start
Is that what this means, then?

01:55:09.092 --> 01:55:10.861 position:27% line:89% align:start
-Just calm down.

01:55:10.894 --> 01:55:13.597 position:16% line:83% align:start
All it means is that the
operation is now underway.

01:55:13.630 --> 01:55:17.668 position:19% line:83% align:start
We'll go to the prime
minister's residence as planned.

01:55:17.701 --> 01:55:18.902 position:27% line:89% align:start
ARAMAKI: Major.

01:55:18.936 --> 01:55:20.637 position:30% line:89% align:start
KUSANAGI: Yes?

01:55:20.671 --> 01:55:21.672 position:13% line:83% align:start
ARAMAKI: The rest of you,
find out where news of our op

01:55:21.705 --> 01:55:22.906 position:27% line:83% align:start
was leaked from.
KUSANAGI: Roger.

01:55:33.684 --> 01:55:35.619 position:44% line:89% align:start
-Hm.

01:55:35.652 --> 01:55:36.920 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, it seems you
weren't exaggerating

01:55:36.954 --> 01:55:38.655 position:5% line:89% align:start
when you said it was top secret.

01:55:38.689 --> 01:55:41.024 position:21% line:83% align:start
Who else besides you
knows of this money trail?

01:55:41.059 --> 01:55:42.260 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Now that you've
read it, there's

01:55:42.293 --> 01:55:46.064 position:5% line:83% align:start
you, of course; Mr. Serano, who
decided to accuse Yakushima;

01:55:46.097 --> 01:55:46.998 position:16% line:89% align:start
and there are my people.

01:55:47.031 --> 01:55:48.765 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's all.

01:55:48.799 --> 01:55:49.766 position:38% line:89% align:start
-I see.

01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:51.102 position:27% line:89% align:start
Very well, then.

01:55:51.135 --> 01:55:53.104 position:19% line:83% align:start
As for Mr. Yakushima,
we'll deal with him

01:55:53.137 --> 01:55:55.106 position:13% line:89% align:start
when the timing is right.

01:55:55.139 --> 01:55:57.108 position:24% line:83% align:start
However, with the
lower house elections,

01:55:57.141 --> 01:55:59.509 position:10% line:89% align:start
we're in a crucial time now.

01:55:59.543 --> 01:56:01.045 position:24% line:83% align:start
I want the public
and the media to feel

01:56:01.079 --> 01:56:03.480 position:10% line:89% align:start
as if they've won a victory.

01:56:03.513 --> 01:56:06.117 position:24% line:83% align:start
If I let a man as
powerful as Yakushima go,

01:56:06.150 --> 01:56:09.787 position:7% line:83% align:start
proportional casualties on our
side are very likely to occur.

01:56:09.821 --> 01:56:11.890 position:16% line:83% align:start
-I don't understand what
you're trying to imply,

01:56:11.923 --> 01:56:12.657 position:27% line:89% align:start
Prime Minister.

01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:17.929 position:19% line:83% align:start
-I mean passage of the
Special Forces Bill.

01:56:28.139 --> 01:56:29.941 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Hey, Chief.
-Mmhm.

01:56:29.974 --> 01:56:37.216 position:7% line:89% align:start
TOGUSA: They're following us.

01:57:07.146 --> 01:57:09.081 position:24% line:83% align:start
MAN: The enemy has
nine think tank units.

01:57:09.114 --> 01:57:11.583 position:13% line:83% align:start
Squads three and four, you
will drop in from above

01:57:11.617 --> 01:57:13.552 position:24% line:83% align:start
and infiltrate the
hangar from the heliport.

01:57:13.585 --> 01:57:16.255 position:16% line:83% align:start
Your top priority is the
destruction of the tanks.

01:57:16.288 --> 01:57:18.190 position:27% line:83% align:start
Squads five and
six, quickly capture

01:57:18.223 --> 01:57:20.059 position:21% line:83% align:start
the seventh primary
members and gain

01:57:20.092 --> 01:57:21.694 position:5% line:89% align:start
control of the entire facility.

01:57:21.727 --> 01:57:23.929 position:19% line:83% align:start
All units, go autistic
once we're in.

01:57:23.963 --> 01:57:26.632 position:16% line:83% align:start
These people specialize
in information warfare.

01:57:26.665 --> 01:57:28.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
We'll pin them down
with brute force.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.268 position:30% line:89% align:start
-Wait, Chief.

01:58:02.302 --> 01:58:04.004 position:27% line:83% align:start
-We came here to
pick you up, sir.

01:58:04.037 --> 01:58:06.139 position:10% line:83% align:start
There are still a few things
you need to do for us.

01:58:10.643 --> 01:58:12.545 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Making all the
necessary arrangements

01:58:12.579 --> 01:58:14.247 position:5% line:89% align:start
in such a short amount of time.

01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:17.083 position:19% line:83% align:start
The prime minister is
certainly a capable man.

01:58:17.117 --> 01:58:19.686 position:7% line:83% align:start
OFFICER: Section 9 is probably
being neutralized as we speak.

01:58:19.719 --> 01:58:26.260 position:30% line:89% align:start
-Neutralized?

01:58:26.293 --> 01:58:27.560 position:27% line:89% align:start
-Take him away.

01:58:27.594 --> 01:58:29.263 position:24% line:89% align:start
OFFICER: Yes, sir.

01:58:29.296 --> 01:58:30.231 position:30% line:89% align:start
-Wait, Chief.

01:58:30.264 --> 01:58:31.164 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's going on?

01:58:31.198 --> 01:58:32.799 position:30% line:89% align:start
What is this?

01:58:32.832 --> 01:58:34.000 position:13% line:89% align:start
Please, explain it to me.

01:58:34.034 --> 01:58:34.968 position:41% line:89% align:start
Chief!

01:58:35.001 --> 01:58:35.902 position:38% line:89% align:start
Tell me!

01:58:45.312 --> 01:58:46.679 position:24% line:83% align:start
BATOU: Is it just
me, or does something

01:58:46.713 --> 01:58:47.847 position:30% line:83% align:start
seem different
about the building?

01:58:47.882 --> 01:58:49.917 position:27% line:83% align:start
And what's with
this mustard call?

01:58:49.950 --> 01:58:51.785 position:19% line:89% align:start
It was a little weird.

01:58:51.819 --> 01:58:53.720 position:7% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: I don't have time to
fill you in on the situation

01:58:53.753 --> 01:58:54.654 position:35% line:89% align:start
right now.

01:58:54.687 --> 01:58:56.656 position:21% line:83% align:start
Just keep quiet and
carry out my orders.

01:58:56.689 --> 01:58:58.658 position:27% line:83% align:start
Prep six generic
prosthetic bodies,

01:58:58.691 --> 01:59:00.928 position:24% line:83% align:start
and bring them to
the command center.

01:59:00.961 --> 01:59:02.096 position:35% line:89% align:start
BATOU: Hm?

01:59:02.129 --> 01:59:03.130 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hold on.

01:59:03.164 --> 01:59:04.965 position:27% line:89% align:start
Are you saying--

01:59:04.999 --> 01:59:05.833 position:21% line:89% align:start
KUSANAGI: Get to it.

01:59:17.278 --> 01:59:18.746 position:38% line:89% align:start
-Major.

01:59:18.779 --> 01:59:20.281 position:16% line:83% align:start
You want to tell us what
the hell's going on?

01:59:24.952 --> 01:59:27.255 position:13% line:89% align:start
-You two take these seeds.

01:59:27.289 --> 01:59:29.391 position:16% line:83% align:start
Once we get out of here,
leak the information

01:59:29.424 --> 01:59:31.625 position:19% line:83% align:start
and then let it sprout
among the media.

01:59:31.659 --> 01:59:33.395 position:13% line:83% align:start
We'll need a push to oust
the secretary general.

02:00:14.069 --> 02:00:16.204 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Verify the situation,
and see to the wounded

02:00:16.238 --> 02:00:17.839 position:19% line:89% align:start
on the double, dammit.

02:00:22.777 --> 02:00:24.179 position:30% line:83% align:start
TACHIKOMA: Oh,
goodness gracious.

02:00:24.212 --> 02:00:26.449 position:24% line:83% align:start
What are we going
to do with you?

02:00:26.482 --> 02:00:29.050 position:19% line:83% align:start
You know you shouldn't
spill your tea like that.

02:00:29.084 --> 02:00:30.051 position:35% line:89% align:start
[humming]

02:00:30.085 --> 02:00:31.220 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, look.

02:00:31.254 --> 02:00:32.221 position:27% line:89% align:start
The news is on.

02:00:32.255 --> 02:00:33.456 position:27% line:89% align:start
Let's watch TV.

02:00:33.489 --> 02:00:34.390 position:10% line:83% align:start
REPORTER: We interrupt this
program to bring you breaking

02:00:34.423 --> 02:00:36.758 position:24% line:83% align:start
news on the latest
Section 9 developments.

02:00:36.791 --> 02:00:39.028 position:10% line:83% align:start
An emergency cabinet meeting
passed a special forces

02:00:39.061 --> 02:00:41.297 position:19% line:83% align:start
restriction bill aimed
at military deployments

02:00:41.330 --> 02:00:44.866 position:10% line:5% align:start
after urging the dismantling
of Public Security Section 9.

02:00:44.901 --> 02:00:47.403 position:7% line:5% align:start
Special forces stormed Section
9's facility moments ago

02:00:47.436 --> 02:00:49.704 position:10% line:5% align:start
when they failed to respond
to repeated warnings,

02:00:49.738 --> 02:00:52.475 position:7% line:5% align:start
indicating the group's intent
to maintain this standoff.

02:00:52.508 --> 02:00:54.911 position:27% line:83% align:start
We now take you
live to the scene.

02:00:54.944 --> 02:00:56.979 position:16% line:83% align:start
REPORTER: A short while
ago above the building

02:00:57.013 --> 02:01:00.750 position:27% line:83% align:start
which houses the
Section 9 complex--

02:01:00.783 --> 02:01:02.718 position:13% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: From here, we'll
go off in three directions

02:01:02.752 --> 02:01:04.320 position:24% line:83% align:start
in order to split
up our pursuers.

02:01:04.353 --> 02:01:06.355 position:21% line:83% align:start
After that, we go to
ground in the city

02:01:06.389 --> 02:01:08.291 position:10% line:89% align:start
and head our separate ways.

02:01:08.324 --> 02:01:10.726 position:24% line:83% align:start
Security Section 9
has now disbanded.

02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:11.827 position:33% line:89% align:start
That is all.

02:01:18.100 --> 02:01:20.002 position:27% line:83% align:start
-They're several
damaged, but we believe

02:01:20.036 --> 02:01:21.270 position:19% line:83% align:start
these are the corpses
of the six members.

02:01:21.305 --> 02:01:25.342 position:5% line:83% align:start
We're analyzing the cyberbrains
for traces of residual usage.

02:01:25.375 --> 02:01:27.810 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Call squad five in here while
you're waiting for the results.

02:01:27.843 --> 02:01:29.446 position:27% line:83% align:start
Assume that this
operation is camouflaged

02:01:29.479 --> 02:01:31.448 position:19% line:83% align:start
and seal off any exit
you can think of,

02:01:31.481 --> 02:01:33.749 position:19% line:83% align:start
including the elevator
shafts, ventilation

02:01:33.783 --> 02:01:35.385 position:7% line:83% align:start
ducts, and every sewer outlet.
-Yes, sir.

02:01:41.491 --> 02:01:44.061 position:19% line:83% align:start
BATOU: So, Section 9's
finally finished, huh?

02:01:44.094 --> 02:01:45.462 position:16% line:83% align:start
All the blood and sweat
we poured into just

02:01:45.495 --> 02:01:47.497 position:16% line:89% align:start
went poof, up in smoke.

02:01:47.531 --> 02:01:49.199 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Yeah.

02:01:49.233 --> 02:01:50.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
Free access to the latest
maintenance and cutting edge

02:01:50.467 --> 02:01:53.203 position:7% line:83% align:start
equipment was a sweet set up,
but when you get down to it,

02:01:53.237 --> 02:01:54.771 position:13% line:89% align:start
that's really all it was.

02:01:54.805 --> 02:01:57.474 position:13% line:83% align:start
The only thing we need to
do is find a new sponsor.

02:01:57.507 --> 02:01:59.142 position:10% line:89% align:start
Or is there something else?

02:01:59.176 --> 02:02:01.945 position:13% line:83% align:start
Have you got some kind of
attachment to the place, Batou?

02:02:01.979 --> 02:02:03.814 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Hm, not if you
put it like that.

02:02:03.847 --> 02:02:05.415 position:24% line:83% align:start
If anything, it's
the good and bad

02:02:05.449 --> 02:02:07.284 position:5% line:89% align:start
times we had-- all the memories.

02:02:07.317 --> 02:02:08.486 position:21% line:89% align:start
KUSANAGI: Memories?

02:02:08.519 --> 02:02:12.923 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's awfully
sentimental of you.

02:02:12.956 --> 02:02:14.958 position:21% line:83% align:start
-While we're on the
subject, that reminds me.

02:02:14.992 --> 02:02:17.294 position:24% line:83% align:start
Where's that watch
you're usually wearing.

02:02:17.327 --> 02:02:19.364 position:16% line:83% align:start
-I had to pick today to
leave it next to my bed

02:02:19.397 --> 02:02:20.797 position:24% line:89% align:start
at my safe house.

02:02:20.831 --> 02:02:21.898 position:24% line:83% align:start
Since they've hit
Section 9, they've

02:02:21.932 --> 02:02:24.402 position:27% line:83% align:start
probably got my
place secured, too.

02:02:24.435 --> 02:02:26.970 position:21% line:83% align:start
-That sucks, because
I seem to remember

02:02:27.004 --> 02:02:29.140 position:13% line:83% align:start
you got that as a gift to
mark the occasion of your very

02:02:29.173 --> 02:02:31.242 position:7% line:89% align:start
last prosthetic body resizing.

02:02:31.276 --> 02:02:34.345 position:27% line:83% align:start
But I don't know
who gave it to you.

02:02:34.379 --> 02:02:35.413 position:30% line:89% align:start
-So you knew?

02:02:35.446 --> 02:02:37.348 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, don't get the wrong idea.

02:02:37.382 --> 02:02:39.384 position:13% line:83% align:start
I didn't actually wear it
for sentimental reasons.

02:02:46.357 --> 02:02:48.893 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, enough idle chatter.

02:02:48.926 --> 02:02:50.528 position:5% line:83% align:start
Once we're out of here, we can't
get in touch with each other

02:02:50.561 --> 02:02:52.130 position:41% line:89% align:start
again.

02:02:52.163 --> 02:02:54.999 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even if we do meet, I
might not be who I am now.

02:02:55.033 --> 02:02:57.435 position:10% line:83% align:start
I want you to give your own
survival top priority, Batou.

02:03:10.582 --> 02:03:12.850 position:13% line:89% align:start
-We should split up here.

02:03:12.884 --> 02:03:13.485 position:33% line:89% align:start
-All right.

02:03:43.449 --> 02:03:45.384 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Hell, this is my
life, isn't it?

02:03:45.417 --> 02:03:47.152 position:16% line:83% align:start
How I decide to waste it
is my own damn business.

02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:12.545 position:10% line:83% align:start
TACHIKOMA: That report about
Section 9 has me worried.

02:04:12.579 --> 02:04:14.347 position:21% line:83% align:start
OLD MAN: The battle
is going badly.

02:04:14.381 --> 02:04:20.219 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Huh?

02:04:20.253 --> 02:04:21.153 position:38% line:89% align:start
I know.

02:04:21.186 --> 02:04:23.623 position:21% line:89% align:start
It sure is, mister.

02:04:23.656 --> 02:04:26.192 position:13% line:89% align:start
The battle is going badly.

02:04:26.226 --> 02:04:28.495 position:19% line:83% align:start
You know the building
that blew up last night?

02:04:28.528 --> 02:04:30.263 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's where I used to live.

02:04:30.296 --> 02:04:32.332 position:19% line:89% align:start
The place was my home.

02:04:32.365 --> 02:04:34.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's pretty nice here.
I can't complain.

02:04:34.667 --> 02:04:37.203 position:7% line:89% align:start
And I like all you old folks.

02:04:37.237 --> 02:04:38.271 position:35% line:89% align:start
You're OK.

02:04:38.304 --> 02:04:42.409 position:16% line:83% align:start
But there's someone that
I really want to go help.

02:04:42.442 --> 02:04:43.710 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

02:04:43.743 --> 02:04:48.081 position:10% line:89% align:start
-The battle is going badly.

02:04:48.114 --> 02:04:50.350 position:19% line:83% align:start
TACHIKOMA: Mister, is
that what I think it is?

02:04:50.383 --> 02:04:52.318 position:27% line:89% align:start
Mister, thanks!

02:04:52.352 --> 02:04:53.620 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna go now.

02:05:06.166 --> 02:05:09.402 position:35% line:89% align:start
Aw, Batou.

02:05:09.437 --> 02:05:11.371 position:19% line:89% align:start
TACHIKOMA: Hey there!

02:05:11.405 --> 02:05:14.040 position:21% line:83% align:start
TACHIKOMA: What are
you guys doing here?

02:05:14.073 --> 02:05:16.109 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Once a problem child,
always a problem child.

02:05:16.142 --> 02:05:17.344 position:19% line:89% align:start
Know what I'm saying.

02:05:17.378 --> 02:05:19.647 position:7% line:83% align:start
This means each of us had the
same thought even though we

02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:21.515 position:5% line:89% align:start
were independent of each other.

02:05:21.549 --> 02:05:22.683 position:27% line:83% align:start
One thing we all
share in common is

02:05:22.716 --> 02:05:25.753 position:7% line:83% align:start
the desire to help Mr. Batou.
-Right.

02:05:25.786 --> 02:05:26.953 position:24% line:83% align:start
And besides, it's
impossible for you

02:05:26.986 --> 02:05:28.756 position:10% line:83% align:start
to load that Howitzer shell
you're holding by yourself,

02:05:28.789 --> 02:05:29.723 position:35% line:89% align:start
isn't it?

02:05:29.757 --> 02:05:31.292 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Yeah.

02:05:31.325 --> 02:05:34.361 position:21% line:83% align:start
But are we the only
Tachikomas who came here?

02:05:34.395 --> 02:05:36.664 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Out of all of us that
were sent back to the lab,

02:05:36.697 --> 02:05:38.332 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm the only one who survived.

02:05:38.365 --> 02:05:40.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
They just left me lying
around hooked up to equipment

02:05:40.768 --> 02:05:43.137 position:24% line:83% align:start
for final testing
like some specimen.

02:05:43.170 --> 02:05:46.006 position:21% line:83% align:start
So I ripped out the
cords and ran away!

02:05:46.040 --> 02:05:48.142 position:5% line:83% align:start
-I couldn't stop wondering what
was going on while I was doing

02:05:48.175 --> 02:05:50.177 position:19% line:83% align:start
high altitude work at
a construction site.

02:05:50.211 --> 02:05:52.112 position:30% line:89% align:start
How about you?

02:05:52.146 --> 02:05:54.248 position:27% line:83% align:start
-I'd say it was
pretty much the same.

02:05:54.281 --> 02:05:57.485 position:16% line:83% align:start
But what happened to the
rest who went to the lab?

02:05:57.518 --> 02:06:00.187 position:7% line:83% align:start
-They're all having structural
analyses run on them.

02:06:00.221 --> 02:06:01.690 position:24% line:83% align:start

But do you know what?

02:06:05.292 --> 02:06:07.529 position:7% line:83% align:start
Everyone who had their brains
taken apart-- they kinda

02:06:07.562 --> 02:06:10.699 position:27% line:83% align:start
looked like they

-Oh, I see.

Right.

This is for my dead partner.

Mr. Batou.

Don't worry.

Don't rush it.

02:12:01.755 --> 02:12:03.591 position:19% line:89% align:start
I only have one shot.

What you and the
others have gained

02:13:18.900 --> 02:13:20.169 position:13% line:89% align:start
This is the last I've got.

02:13:28.177 --> 02:13:30.612 position:44% line:83% align:start
Now!

-What were they doing here?

02:14:07.917 --> 02:14:09.685 position:16% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: The only thing
they could think about

02:14:09.719 --> 02:14:14.123 position:16% line:83% align:start
was saving you, so they
escaped from the lab.

02:14:14.156 --> 02:14:15.725 position:30% line:89% align:start
BATOU: Major.

02:14:15.758 --> 02:14:17.260 position:33% line:89% align:start
is that you?

02:14:17.294 --> 02:14:19.028 position:16% line:83% align:start

the call that they were

02:14:19.061 --> 02:14:20.663 position:24% line:83% align:start
useless as weapons
because they're

02:14:20.696 --> 02:14:23.033 position:10% line:89% align:start
AI had evolved too quickly.

02:14:23.066 --> 02:14:24.567 position:30% line:83% align:start
But the entire
time that they were

02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:26.769 position:24% line:83% align:start
busy pursuing the
accumulation of data

02:14:26.802 --> 02:14:29.638 position:19% line:83% align:start
and synchronizing with
each other again and again,

02:14:29.672 --> 02:14:32.742 position:30% line:83% align:start
they were also
acquiring individuality.

02:14:32.775 --> 02:14:34.044 position:30% line:89% align:start
I never knew.

02:14:34.077 --> 02:14:35.544 position:27% line:89% align:start
Not an inkling.

02:14:35.578 --> 02:14:39.116 position:16% line:83% align:start
They even became capable
of self sacrifice.

sooner instead of now when it's

02:14:41.985 --> 02:14:44.855 position:16% line:83% align:start
too late, because maybe
then I could have found out

02:14:44.888 --> 02:14:46.923 position:16% line:83% align:start
whether or not what the
Tachikoma had acquired

Anyway, I'm in your debt.

02:19:47.896 --> 02:19:49.331 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

02:19:49.364 --> 02:19:52.267 position:7% line:83% align:start
The way you kept your promise
was extremely charming.

02:19:57.238 --> 02:20:00.041 position:19% line:83% align:start
TOGUSA: You know what
needs to be done, he said.

02:20:00.075 --> 02:20:02.611 position:19% line:83% align:start
Every Section 9 member
has a unique ability,

02:20:02.645 --> 02:20:04.879 position:7% line:89% align:start
and you work best on your own.

02:20:04.913 --> 02:20:08.517 position:10% line:83% align:start
But individual success is a
reflection of strong team work.

02:20:08.551 --> 02:20:11.454 position:10% line:83% align:start
That was the first nugget of
wisdom the old man offered us

02:20:11.487 --> 02:20:13.589 position:24% line:83% align:start
back in the glory
days of Section 9.

02:20:13.622 --> 02:20:22.565 position:7% line:89% align:start
REPORTER: We've been informed

02:20:22.598 --> 02:20:24.100 position:13% line:89% align:start
will be arriving shortly.

02:20:24.133 --> 02:20:25.668 position:21% line:83% align:start
Throngs of reporters
are gathered here

02:20:25.701 --> 02:20:27.336 position:19% line:83% align:start
in front of the ruling
party headquarters,

02:20:27.370 --> 02:20:29.438 position:10% line:89% align:start
and the atmosphere is tense.

02:20:29.472 --> 02:20:32.274 position:13% line:83% align:start
Making the tabloid rounds
before lower house elections,

02:20:32.308 --> 02:20:35.911 position:13% line:83% align:start
the MHLW scandal involving
Serano Genomics implicated

02:20:35.945 --> 02:20:37.646 position:10% line:89% align:start
Secretary General Yakushima.

02:20:37.681 --> 02:20:39.515 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now, a week after the
forming of a new cabinet,

02:20:39.548 --> 02:20:42.051 position:13% line:83% align:start
this scandal has prompted
a full scale investigation

02:20:42.084 --> 02:20:43.185 position:30% line:83% align:start
by the public
prosecutor's office.

02:20:43.219 --> 02:20:44.588 position:5% line:89% align:start
REPORTER: --said the prosecutor.

02:20:44.621 --> 02:20:46.088 position:13% line:83% align:start
A full scale investigation
has been launched--

02:20:50.159 --> 02:20:51.093 position:24% line:89% align:start
MAN: It's the DA.

02:20:51.127 --> 02:20:52.061 position:33% line:89% align:start
MAN: The DA!

02:20:55.164 --> 02:20:56.298 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Sir, things are
just getting started,

02:20:56.332 --> 02:20:59.068 position:13% line:83% align:start
but before the day's out,
will Yakushima be arrested?

02:20:59.101 --> 02:21:00.370 position:27% line:83% align:start
-What about the
Serano stocks rumored

02:21:00.404 --> 02:21:02.972 position:21% line:83% align:start
to be here at ruling
party headquarters?

02:21:03.005 --> 02:21:05.074 position:7% line:89% align:start
-We have reliable information.

02:21:05.107 --> 02:21:06.676 position:19% line:83% align:start
The Secretary General
would like to be asked

02:21:06.710 --> 02:21:08.278 position:5% line:89% align:start
to come with us for questioning.

02:21:08.311 --> 02:21:10.113 position:16% line:83% align:start
PRESS MEMBER: Any chance
that the cash in sequentially

02:21:10.147 --> 02:21:12.416 position:13% line:83% align:start
numbered bills referred to
in Mr. Serano's testimony

02:21:12.449 --> 02:21:14.351 position:21% line:89% align:start
is being kept here?

02:21:14.384 --> 02:21:17.454 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Everything will be
made clear very shortly.

02:21:17.487 --> 02:21:19.156 position:21% line:83% align:start
My staff and I have
labored long and hard

02:21:19.189 --> 02:21:21.057 position:21% line:83% align:start
to prepare for this
day in anticipation

02:21:21.091 --> 02:21:23.059 position:10% line:89% align:start
of arresting Mr. Yakushima.

02:21:23.093 --> 02:21:24.694 position:21% line:83% align:start
TOGUSA: Is this how
things should be?

02:21:24.728 --> 02:21:27.164 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't these facts that
Section 9 pieced together

02:21:27.197 --> 02:21:29.065 position:16% line:83% align:start
show the truth about the
Laughing Man incident

02:21:29.099 --> 02:21:31.401 position:21% line:89% align:start
from six years ago?

02:21:31.435 --> 02:21:34.070 position:13% line:83% align:start
And even if the prosecutor
succeeds in uncovering

02:21:34.104 --> 02:21:36.106 position:24% line:83% align:start
the whole scandal,
Yakushima still

02:21:36.139 --> 02:21:38.442 position:27% line:83% align:start
might not resign
from the assembly.

02:21:38.475 --> 02:21:40.544 position:13% line:83% align:start
Exactly how does this make
the world a better place?

02:22:04.034 --> 02:22:08.673 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's not like I had aspirations
to be a hero or anything.

02:22:08.706 --> 02:22:11.609 position:16% line:83% align:start
However, I'm positive we
followed a code of justice

02:22:11.642 --> 02:22:13.511 position:16% line:83% align:start
that all of us believed
in without condition

02:22:13.544 --> 02:22:15.713 position:30% line:89% align:start
or compromise.

02:22:15.746 --> 02:22:18.483 position:16% line:83% align:start
Laughing Man-- you were
the one who first tried

02:22:18.516 --> 02:22:21.118 position:10% line:83% align:start
to shed some light into the
black abyss of this case

02:22:21.152 --> 02:22:23.187 position:21% line:83% align:start
and bring it to the
world's attention.

02:22:23.221 --> 02:22:26.090 position:30% line:83% align:start
Is it possible
that at this moment

02:22:26.123 --> 02:22:29.227 position:5% line:89% align:start
you're feeling the same as I am.

02:22:29.260 --> 02:22:31.162 position:24% line:89% align:start
No, you wouldn't.

02:22:31.195 --> 02:22:32.230 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're not the
type to be bothered

02:22:32.263 --> 02:22:33.799 position:16% line:89% align:start
by something like that.

02:22:33.832 --> 02:22:35.566 position:21% line:83% align:start
You must have had a
revelation about something,

02:22:35.600 --> 02:22:38.135 position:10% line:83% align:start
and you're watching us with
eyes that see the big picture.

02:22:38.169 --> 02:22:40.137 position:24% line:89% align:start
Isn't that right?

02:22:40.171 --> 02:22:42.073 position:33% line:89% align:start
I can tell.

02:22:42.106 --> 02:22:45.577 position:10% line:83% align:start
Major, if all this plays out
the way I think it will--

02:23:11.703 --> 02:23:13.272 position:27% line:89% align:start
BATOU: Hold it.

02:23:13.305 --> 02:23:15.307 position:19% line:83% align:start
Put your hands up nice
and slow and turn around.

02:23:23.850 --> 02:23:25.450 position:27% line:83% align:start
As lousy as you
are, you'd be caught

02:23:25.484 --> 02:23:27.352 position:27% line:83% align:start
before you could
even see Yakushima.

02:23:27.386 --> 02:23:33.258 position:38% line:89% align:start
-Batou.

02:23:33.292 --> 02:23:36.194 position:7% line:89% align:start
You're a dummy, you know that?

02:23:36.228 --> 02:23:36.863 position:24% line:89% align:start
Come on, let's go.

02:23:45.538 --> 02:23:47.439 position:30% line:89% align:start
[car honking]

02:23:55.682 --> 02:23:57.784 position:19% line:89% align:start
-And the star arrives.

02:23:57.817 --> 02:23:59.686 position:16% line:89% align:start
-What took you so long?

02:23:59.719 --> 02:24:01.888 position:27% line:83% align:start
-So where'd you
end up tailing him?

02:24:01.921 --> 02:24:03.121 position:21% line:89% align:start
-Just as we figured.

02:24:03.155 --> 02:24:04.724 position:5% line:89% align:start
He went to the ruling party HQ.

02:24:04.757 --> 02:24:07.560 position:24% line:89% align:start
-Are you serious?

02:24:07.594 --> 02:24:08.328 position:30% line:89% align:start
-What's wrong?

02:24:08.361 --> 02:24:09.295 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey.

02:24:09.329 --> 02:24:10.730 position:27% line:89% align:start
Are you crying?

02:24:10.763 --> 02:24:11.631 position:33% line:89% align:start
-Yeah, sure.

02:24:11.664 --> 02:24:12.899 position:35% line:89% align:start
Get real.

02:24:12.932 --> 02:24:15.268 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Well, how did everything
go on your end?

02:24:15.301 --> 02:24:17.270 position:30% line:83% align:start
-It seems like
Yakushima's given in.

02:24:17.303 --> 02:24:18.705 position:13% line:89% align:start
He's cooperating with him.

02:24:18.738 --> 02:24:21.341 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's a typical
ex-military fellow for you.

02:24:21.374 --> 02:24:22.843 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'll bet the
prosecution's going to get

02:24:22.876 --> 02:24:24.777 position:24% line:83% align:start
the hero treatment
because of this.

02:24:24.812 --> 02:24:26.446 position:21% line:89% align:start
-You got that right.

02:24:26.479 --> 02:24:28.381 position:7% line:89% align:start
-And you're all OK with this?

02:24:28.414 --> 02:24:30.483 position:10% line:83% align:start
I mean, don't you think the
credit for tracking him down--

02:24:30.516 --> 02:24:32.185 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Should go to us
here at Section 9?

02:24:32.218 --> 02:24:34.621 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's what you want to say?

02:24:34.655 --> 02:24:37.290 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, it ain't like we
don't feel the same way.

02:24:37.323 --> 02:24:38.859 position:27% line:83% align:start
However, this is
the way the old man

02:24:38.892 --> 02:24:40.426 position:7% line:89% align:start
had it set up the whole time.

02:24:40.460 --> 02:24:41.829 position:13% line:89% align:start
So we're rolling with it.

02:24:41.862 --> 02:24:43.463 position:27% line:89% align:start
TOGUSA: Set up?

02:24:43.497 --> 02:24:45.231 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Yeah.

02:24:45.264 --> 02:24:47.468 position:7% line:83% align:start
When it dawned on the old ape
that the prime minister was

02:24:47.501 --> 02:24:49.837 position:24% line:83% align:start
going to avoid his
secretary general shape up

02:24:49.870 --> 02:24:51.705 position:21% line:83% align:start
before the elections
took place, he

02:24:51.739 --> 02:24:53.440 position:27% line:83% align:start
made a hell of a
bold decision to make

02:24:53.474 --> 02:24:56.276 position:7% line:89% align:start
Section 9 out as the bad guys.

02:24:56.310 --> 02:24:58.746 position:16% line:83% align:start
Right when the major was
disguised as the Laughing Man,

02:24:58.779 --> 02:25:02.216 position:19% line:83% align:start
finagling the truth of
Serano, Section 9's existence

02:25:02.249 --> 02:25:03.050 position:16% line:89% align:start
was leaked to the media.

02:25:03.083 --> 02:25:04.852 position:33% line:83% align:start
That made it
impossible for us to do

02:25:04.885 --> 02:25:07.187 position:5% line:89% align:start
our thing secretly like before.

02:25:07.221 --> 02:25:08.756 position:5% line:89% align:start
So the chief cooked up a scheme.

02:25:08.789 --> 02:25:10.491 position:27% line:83% align:start
He'd make a deal
with the PM and force

02:25:10.524 --> 02:25:12.726 position:16% line:83% align:start
the public prosecutor's
office to take action.

02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:15.362 position:27% line:83% align:start
He pretended to
sacrifice Section 9.

02:25:15.396 --> 02:25:18.666 position:19% line:89% align:start
-Sacrifice Section 9?

02:25:18.699 --> 02:25:21.435 position:24% line:83% align:start
Even if that's the
case, have you any idea

02:25:21.468 --> 02:25:23.303 position:16% line:83% align:start
what it was like for me
these past three months?

02:25:23.337 --> 02:25:25.372 position:10% line:83% align:start
I had no way of knowing what
had happened to you guys?

02:25:25.406 --> 02:25:27.608 position:10% line:89% align:start
-Hey, don't take it so hard.

02:25:27.641 --> 02:25:29.878 position:24% line:83% align:start
Think of it as an
extended vacation.

02:25:29.911 --> 02:25:31.680 position:16% line:83% align:start
-It's not as if we were
filled in on the details

02:25:31.713 --> 02:25:33.715 position:24% line:83% align:start
of this little op
before hand, either.

02:25:33.748 --> 02:25:36.316 position:7% line:83% align:start
-The chief was confident that
we would survive, then find

02:25:36.350 --> 02:25:37.819 position:30% line:83% align:start
each other and
regroup, which is why

02:25:37.852 --> 02:25:41.221 position:13% line:83% align:start
he made the tough decision
to go ahead with his plan.

02:25:41.255 --> 02:25:42.891 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Hell, you're arrest
and confinement

02:25:42.924 --> 02:25:44.324 position:13% line:89% align:start
was a way to protect you.

02:25:44.358 --> 02:25:46.461 position:24% line:83% align:start
The chief had kept
you alive and safe

02:25:46.494 --> 02:25:49.597 position:10% line:83% align:start
by getting you clear of the
Section 9 cleanup operation.

02:25:49.631 --> 02:25:52.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
For one thing, your
body's totally natural.

02:25:52.500 --> 02:25:54.302 position:19% line:83% align:start
And you'd just gotten
out of the hospital, not

02:25:54.335 --> 02:25:56.004 position:27% line:83% align:start
to mention that
you're a married man.

02:25:56.037 --> 02:25:58.773 position:10% line:83% align:start
Fudging data would be hard,
so he kept you out of the loop

02:25:58.807 --> 02:25:59.708 position:24% line:89% align:start
till it was safe.

02:25:59.741 --> 02:26:01.276 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't be too offended.

02:26:01.309 --> 02:26:03.411 position:27% line:83% align:start
According to the
records, I'm a convict

02:26:03.445 --> 02:26:05.313 position:21% line:83% align:start
spending the rest of
my days up the river.

02:26:05.346 --> 02:26:08.316 position:13% line:83% align:start
-More profit, less honor--
meaning that we're once again

02:26:08.349 --> 02:26:11.020 position:10% line:83% align:start
an offensive organization,
which doesn't officially exist,

02:26:11.053 --> 02:26:12.387 position:35% line:89% align:start
of course.

02:26:12.420 --> 02:26:15.690 position:5% line:89% align:start
-That's what this was all about?

02:26:15.724 --> 02:26:17.492 position:27% line:89% align:start
But-- hey, guys.

02:26:17.525 --> 02:26:18.060 position:35% line:89% align:start
The major.

02:26:18.094 --> 02:26:20.428 position:19% line:89% align:start
What happened to her?

02:26:20.462 --> 02:26:21.396 position:33% line:89% align:start
-Who cares?

02:26:21.429 --> 02:26:23.364 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't give a rat's
ass about that bitch.

02:26:29.805 --> 02:26:30.840 position:16% line:89% align:start
-Batou, that reminds me.

02:26:30.873 --> 02:26:32.808 position:16% line:83% align:start
Weren't you balling your
eyes out a few months ago?

02:26:32.842 --> 02:26:34.643 position:27% line:89% align:start
-Ah, screw you.

02:26:34.677 --> 02:26:35.510 position:33% line:89% align:start
-Oh, really?

02:26:35.543 --> 02:26:36.912 position:24% line:83% align:start
In that case, what
do you say I grab

02:26:36.946 --> 02:26:38.581 position:19% line:83% align:start
the satellite footage
from the scene?

02:26:38.614 --> 02:26:39.582 position:33% line:89% align:start
SAITO: Yeah.

02:26:39.615 --> 02:26:40.816 position:19% line:83% align:start
And you ought to send
it to the major, too.

02:26:40.850 --> 02:26:41.917 position:33% line:83% align:start
-All right.
Cut it out.

02:26:41.951 --> 02:26:43.451 position:38% line:89% align:start
-Motoko!

02:26:43.486 --> 02:26:43.986 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right?

02:26:44.019 --> 02:26:44.920 position:21% line:89% align:start
BATOU: You bastard.

02:26:44.954 --> 02:26:47.523 position:10% line:89% align:start
I told you to stop, dammit.

02:26:47.556 --> 02:26:50.559 position:27% line:83% align:start
Say good night.
ISHIKAWA: I give, I give!

02:26:55.898 --> 02:26:57.433 position:19% line:89% align:start
-Seems like it's over.

02:27:00.503 --> 02:27:02.738 position:16% line:83% align:start
The rest can be left to
the attorney general.

02:27:02.772 --> 02:27:05.341 position:19% line:89% align:start
My work here is done.

02:27:05.374 --> 02:27:06.776 position:33% line:83% align:start
-The public
prosecutor's office will

02:27:06.809 --> 02:27:09.345 position:19% line:83% align:start
be able to hold their
heads high thanks to this.

02:27:09.378 --> 02:27:11.747 position:10% line:83% align:start
But now that it's all behind
us, what remains for you?

02:27:11.781 --> 02:27:14.050 position:24% line:83% align:start
-For my part, I'm
just gratified that I

02:27:14.084 --> 02:27:16.086 position:5% line:89% align:start
was able to see justice served.

02:27:16.119 --> 02:27:18.354 position:13% line:89% align:start
And that's enough for me.

02:27:18.387 --> 02:27:20.689 position:44% line:89% align:start
-Hm.

02:27:20.723 --> 02:27:23.726 position:5% line:89% align:start
So what are your current plans?

02:27:23.759 --> 02:27:26.662 position:7% line:83% align:start
You can't keep on playing war
with tanks and weapons forever,

02:27:26.695 --> 02:27:28.464 position:35% line:89% align:start
you know?

02:27:28.497 --> 02:27:31.400 position:16% line:89% align:start
Why not join up with us?

02:27:31.433 --> 02:27:32.535 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've always thought
you were better

02:27:32.568 --> 02:27:34.638 position:7% line:89% align:start
suited for the judicial world.

02:27:34.671 --> 02:27:36.940 position:16% line:89% align:start
-Well, I'm not so sure.

02:27:36.973 --> 02:27:39.976 position:13% line:83% align:start
Section 9 wasn't finished
by this trivial matter.

02:27:40.010 --> 02:27:42.646 position:10% line:89% align:start
I intend to rebuild my unit.

02:27:42.679 --> 02:27:45.615 position:13% line:83% align:start
In fact, I'm on my way to
scout a prospective member.

02:27:45.649 --> 02:27:46.516 position:44% line:89% align:start
-Oh.

02:28:23.054 --> 02:28:23.720 position:16% line:89% align:start
KUSANAGI: Now I get it.

02:28:26.724 --> 02:28:28.693 position:19% line:83% align:start
You really aren't the
Laughing Man, that's for sure.

02:29:11.169 --> 02:29:12.670 position:19% line:89% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: Welcome.

02:29:12.703 --> 02:29:14.705 position:5% line:89% align:start
You took longer than I expected.

02:29:14.739 --> 02:29:16.841 position:7% line:89% align:start
KUSANAGI: Don't give me that.

02:29:16.875 --> 02:29:18.809 position:21% line:83% align:start
You didn't even send
me an invitation.

02:29:18.844 --> 02:29:21.679 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you stay right where you
are, eventually the world

02:29:21.712 --> 02:29:22.948 position:24% line:89% align:start
will come to you.

02:29:22.981 --> 02:29:25.650 position:24% line:83% align:start
-I believe it was
Doisneau who said that?

02:29:25.683 --> 02:29:26.584 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Yes.

02:29:26.617 --> 02:29:28.220 position:21% line:83% align:start
-I had a lot of time
to think about what

02:29:28.253 --> 02:29:29.955 position:16% line:89% align:start
should be done with you.

02:29:29.988 --> 02:29:32.157 position:10% line:83% align:start
There wasn't much else to do
while I was floating around.

02:29:32.190 --> 02:29:33.859 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Speaking of which, I
thought you might have

02:29:33.892 --> 02:29:35.994 position:24% line:83% align:start
decided to keep on
floating like that.

02:29:36.028 --> 02:29:37.663 position:19% line:83% align:start
I was afraid that you
were going to die.

02:29:37.696 --> 02:29:40.132 position:13% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: I'm not ready to
bid life farewell just yet,

02:29:40.165 --> 02:29:42.734 position:5% line:83% align:start
though I did have an interesting
little near death experience

02:29:42.768 --> 02:29:45.203 position:24% line:83% align:start
during this recent
business when my fully

02:29:45.237 --> 02:29:47.873 position:5% line:89% align:start
remote cyberbrain was blown off.

02:29:47.906 --> 02:29:49.775 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Your brand new
body was destroyed.

02:29:49.808 --> 02:29:51.743 position:13% line:83% align:start
But you still haven't done
a prosthetic swap out.

02:29:56.114 --> 02:29:57.716 position:27% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: You've
got a sharp eye.

02:29:57.749 --> 02:30:00.186 position:10% line:89% align:start
-Well, peeking is my hobby.

02:30:00.219 --> 02:30:02.020 position:21% line:89% align:start
-So what's the deal?

02:30:02.054 --> 02:30:04.556 position:19% line:89% align:start
Meaning, what is this?

02:30:04.589 --> 02:30:06.591 position:33% line:83% align:start
Some kind of
information graveyard?

02:30:06.625 --> 02:30:08.127 position:24% line:83% align:start
Did you seriously
think you could

02:30:08.161 --> 02:30:10.829 position:24% line:83% align:start
somehow change the
world from here?

02:30:10.862 --> 02:30:14.133 position:16% line:89% align:start
-Yeah, sort of at first.

02:30:14.167 --> 02:30:16.002 position:7% line:89% align:start
-How do you feel about it now?

02:30:16.035 --> 02:30:19.638 position:19% line:83% align:start
-I'm not blazing with
satisfaction or anything.

02:30:19.671 --> 02:30:21.673 position:27% line:83% align:start
But the truth is
it all ended for me

02:30:21.707 --> 02:30:23.276 position:21% line:83% align:start
the instant I shared
my memories with you.

02:30:23.309 --> 02:30:26.112 position:5% line:89% align:start
At that point, my work was done.

02:30:26.145 --> 02:30:28.881 position:5% line:83% align:start
I figured that you'd probably be
able to run with it from there.

02:30:28.915 --> 02:30:30.183 position:33% line:89% align:start
-Is that so?

02:30:30.216 --> 02:30:32.151 position:7% line:89% align:start
You're a hell of a liar, kid.

02:30:32.185 --> 02:30:34.854 position:21% line:83% align:start
I clearly recall you
didn't want me involved.

02:30:34.887 --> 02:30:35.822 position:33% line:89% align:start
-I'm sorry.

02:30:35.855 --> 02:30:37.790 position:24% line:83% align:start
But the minute you
share and synchronize

02:30:37.824 --> 02:30:40.293 position:19% line:83% align:start
all your information,
you lose your uniqueness

02:30:40.326 --> 02:30:41.961 position:21% line:83% align:start
and become absorbed
into the unconscious

02:30:41.995 --> 02:30:45.598 position:10% line:83% align:start
malice of a third party that
has no motive, or perhaps

02:30:45.631 --> 02:30:49.969 position:16% line:83% align:start
into the will of someone
who does have one.

02:30:50.003 --> 02:30:52.205 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Are those your words based on
what you've acquired from hard

02:30:52.239 --> 02:30:53.639 position:24% line:89% align:start
earned experience?

02:30:53.673 --> 02:30:56.542 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Yes, because the
fact is you yourself

02:30:56.576 --> 02:30:59.012 position:21% line:83% align:start
played the role of a
Laughing Man copycat as well.

02:30:59.045 --> 02:31:02.582 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Well, I have to admit, it
was a fascinating phenomenon.

02:31:02.615 --> 02:31:04.550 position:19% line:83% align:start
At any rate, what was
your underlying reason

02:31:04.584 --> 02:31:07.854 position:7% line:83% align:start
for orchestrating such a huge
event in the first place?

02:31:07.887 --> 02:31:09.856 position:13% line:83% align:start
-To you, everything that's
happening in the world

02:31:09.889 --> 02:31:13.826 position:7% line:83% align:start
appears phony, to be something
other than what it is, right?

02:31:13.860 --> 02:31:15.728 position:30% line:83% align:start
-JD Salinger?
-Yes.

02:31:18.598 --> 02:31:20.633 position:24% line:83% align:start
And when it comes
to cyberization,

02:31:20.666 --> 02:31:23.137 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm pretty much the
perfect poster boy.

02:31:23.170 --> 02:31:24.805 position:24% line:83% align:start
So you'd think at
the very least,

02:31:24.838 --> 02:31:26.106 position:24% line:83% align:start
I would have felt
terrified of the thought

02:31:26.140 --> 02:31:29.209 position:30% line:83% align:start
of contracting
cyberbrain sclerosis.

02:31:29.243 --> 02:31:30.978 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'll tell you.

02:31:31.011 --> 02:31:32.946 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was a simple piece of
mail I stumbled across

02:31:32.980 --> 02:31:34.681 position:19% line:83% align:start
in the net that began
this whole thing.

02:31:37.217 --> 02:31:39.153 position:24% line:83% align:start
What I'd found was
a blackmail document

02:31:39.186 --> 02:31:42.856 position:19% line:83% align:start
that had probably been
sent to Serano Gemonics.

02:31:42.890 --> 02:31:44.925 position:13% line:83% align:start
It was armed with a thesis
that was a comparative study

02:31:44.958 --> 02:31:47.728 position:21% line:83% align:start
of the inadequacy of
Serrano micro machines

02:31:47.761 --> 02:31:50.931 position:16% line:83% align:start
versus the effectiveness
of the Murai vaccine.

02:31:50.964 --> 02:31:54.335 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Then the original Laughing Man
was the person who authored it?

02:31:54.369 --> 02:31:56.703 position:5% line:89% align:start
-You could say that, I suppose.

02:31:56.737 --> 02:31:58.739 position:19% line:83% align:start
I am the machine that
reveals the world

02:31:58.772 --> 02:32:00.774 position:24% line:83% align:start
to as only I alone
am able to see it.

02:32:00.808 --> 02:32:02.143 position:30% line:89% align:start
-Dziga Vertov.

02:32:02.177 --> 02:32:03.977 position:27% line:83% align:start
He was a Russian
filmmaker, wasn't he?

02:32:04.011 --> 02:32:05.180 position:24% line:89% align:start
LAUGHING MAN: Yes.

02:32:05.213 --> 02:32:07.748 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was kidding myself by thinking
it was my personal mission

02:32:07.781 --> 02:32:09.951 position:19% line:83% align:start
to prove and circulate
that information--

02:32:09.984 --> 02:32:12.153 position:24% line:83% align:start
Vital data I alone
had discovered.

02:32:12.187 --> 02:32:14.621 position:16% line:89% align:start
-Failing spectacularly.

02:32:14.655 --> 02:32:17.691 position:5% line:83% align:start
The pure innocent mediator grew
dejected at the base nature

02:32:17.724 --> 02:32:19.127 position:19% line:83% align:start
of the social system,
and he turned mute.

02:32:19.160 --> 02:32:20.862 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

02:32:20.895 --> 02:32:23.865 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was because of that I
became the vanishing mediator,

02:32:23.898 --> 02:32:26.668 position:13% line:83% align:start
just like an author whose
existence is emphasized

02:32:26.701 --> 02:32:28.069 position:27% line:83% align:start
by the fact that
he rarely puts out

02:32:28.103 --> 02:32:30.405 position:7% line:89% align:start
any new works for publication.

02:32:30.438 --> 02:32:32.107 position:24% line:83% align:start
In other words, by
disappearing, it

02:32:32.140 --> 02:32:34.242 position:21% line:83% align:start
acts as a regulating
medium for the dynamism

02:32:34.275 --> 02:32:35.710 position:19% line:89% align:start
of the social system.

02:32:35.743 --> 02:32:38.113 position:27% line:83% align:start
Per sociological
theory, it ultimately

02:32:38.146 --> 02:32:40.148 position:21% line:83% align:start
vanishes, leaving no
trace of its presence,

02:32:40.181 --> 02:32:42.317 position:7% line:89% align:start
inside or outside the system.

02:32:42.350 --> 02:32:44.953 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Fredric Jameson, I believe.
-Yes.

02:32:44.986 --> 02:32:46.788 position:38% line:89% align:start
But no.

02:32:46.821 --> 02:32:48.857 position:7% line:89% align:start
The latter was Masachi Osawa.

02:32:48.890 --> 02:32:51.059 position:24% line:83% align:start
Even though I was
familiar with the words,

02:32:51.092 --> 02:32:53.761 position:13% line:83% align:start
I didn't believe it until
I saw it with my own eyes.

02:32:53.795 --> 02:32:55.730 position:21% line:83% align:start
Who knew that copies
could still be produced

02:32:55.763 --> 02:32:58.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
despite the absence
of an original?

02:32:58.234 --> 02:33:00.236 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you had to give a
name to this phenomenon,

02:33:00.269 --> 02:33:02.670 position:16% line:89% align:start
what would you label it?

02:33:02.704 --> 02:33:04.973 position:24% line:83% align:start
-It would be stand
alone complex.

02:33:05.007 --> 02:33:06.242 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Right.
Yes.

02:33:06.275 --> 02:33:08.210 position:16% line:89% align:start
The stand alone complex.

02:33:08.244 --> 02:33:11.013 position:5% line:83% align:start
From the start, the very nature
of our current social system

02:33:11.046 --> 02:33:13.015 position:24% line:83% align:start
has contained the
mechanisms to trigger

02:33:13.048 --> 02:33:15.117 position:10% line:89% align:start
such an amazing occurrence.

02:33:15.151 --> 02:33:16.919 position:21% line:83% align:start
Personally, however,
I feel this marks

02:33:16.952 --> 02:33:19.188 position:24% line:83% align:start
the beginning of a
new era of despair.

02:33:19.221 --> 02:33:20.923 position:21% line:89% align:start
What's your opinion?

02:33:20.956 --> 02:33:21.624 position:30% line:89% align:start
-I don't know.

02:33:21.656 --> 02:33:24.894 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's impossible for me to say.

02:33:24.927 --> 02:33:27.096 position:13% line:83% align:start
Although I have found one
thing capable of restoring

02:33:27.129 --> 02:33:29.298 position:16% line:83% align:start
your individuality after
all your information

02:33:29.331 --> 02:33:31.100 position:19% line:89% align:start
has been synchronized.

02:33:31.133 --> 02:33:31.800 position:33% line:89% align:start
-Oh, really?

02:33:31.834 --> 02:33:32.735 position:27% line:89% align:start
And what's that?

02:33:37.773 --> 02:33:40.075 position:21% line:83% align:start
KUSANAGI: Every day
human curiosity.

02:33:40.109 --> 02:33:41.076 position:44% line:89% align:start
-Oh.

02:33:41.110 --> 02:33:42.211 position:30% line:89% align:start
You're right.

02:33:42.244 --> 02:33:45.047 position:13% line:83% align:start
You know, that's something
that never occurred to me.

02:33:45.080 --> 02:33:49.118 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think my brain has
already started to harden.

02:33:49.151 --> 02:33:49.919 position:44% line:89% align:start
OK.

02:33:49.952 --> 02:33:50.986 position:27% line:83% align:start
What's going to
happen to me now?

02:33:51.020 --> 02:33:53.889 position:19% line:83% align:start
Will I be arrested for
kidnapping or for inciting

02:33:53.923 --> 02:33:56.359 position:19% line:83% align:start
multiple simultaneous
terrorist attacks?

02:33:56.393 --> 02:33:58.161 position:21% line:89% align:start
-Hey, don't ask me.

02:33:58.195 --> 02:34:01.264 position:19% line:83% align:start
That little matter is
completely at his discretion.

02:34:01.298 --> 02:34:04.267 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why not ask him yourself?

02:34:04.301 --> 02:34:06.802 position:21% line:83% align:start
-I've been listening
in for a while now.

02:34:06.835 --> 02:34:08.505 position:30% line:83% align:start
But without an
external memory device,

02:34:08.538 --> 02:34:11.141 position:5% line:89% align:start
I couldn't keep up with you two.

02:34:11.174 --> 02:34:13.944 position:19% line:83% align:start
Have you every single
book in here, young man?

02:34:13.977 --> 02:34:15.912 position:27% line:89% align:start
-Not every book.

02:34:15.946 --> 02:34:17.347 position:19% line:89% align:start
-Let me introduce you.

02:34:17.380 --> 02:34:19.015 position:16% line:89% align:start
This is Daisuke Aramaki.

02:34:19.049 --> 02:34:21.818 position:24% line:83% align:start
He's my boss, the
chief of Section 9.

02:34:21.851 --> 02:34:24.788 position:7% line:89% align:start
-I'm very pleased to meet you.

02:34:24.821 --> 02:34:26.223 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Do you actually
plan to continue

02:34:26.256 --> 02:34:28.992 position:13% line:83% align:start
with this dull, futureless
occupation of preserving

02:34:29.025 --> 02:34:31.494 position:13% line:83% align:start
obsolete printed materials
that nowadays are only

02:34:31.529 --> 02:34:33.797 position:5% line:89% align:start
published out of force of habit?

02:34:33.830 --> 02:34:34.498 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Yes.

02:34:34.532 --> 02:34:36.500 position:5% line:89% align:start
If I'm allowed to, then I will.

02:34:36.534 --> 02:34:38.335 position:24% line:83% align:start
ARAMAKI: As far as
this case is concerned,

02:34:38.368 --> 02:34:40.870 position:10% line:83% align:start
it'll probably be concluded
that the original Laughing

02:34:40.904 --> 02:34:43.441 position:7% line:89% align:start
Man never officially existed.

02:34:43.474 --> 02:34:45.141 position:10% line:89% align:start
So I have an offer to make.

02:34:45.175 --> 02:34:46.344 position:30% line:89% align:start
And it's this.

02:34:46.377 --> 02:34:49.247 position:7% line:83% align:start
Do you want to put your hacker
skills to use and join up

02:34:49.280 --> 02:34:51.482 position:19% line:83% align:start
with Section 9 as our
ninth regular team player?

02:34:54.318 --> 02:34:55.219 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Wow.

02:34:55.253 --> 02:34:56.220 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm surprised.

02:34:56.254 --> 02:34:58.356 position:10% line:89% align:start
You came here to recruit me.

02:34:58.389 --> 02:34:59.923 position:30% line:89% align:start
-That's right.

02:34:59.956 --> 02:35:00.790 position:41% line:89% align:start
-Man.

02:35:00.824 --> 02:35:02.460 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm speechless.

02:35:02.493 --> 02:35:05.296 position:19% line:83% align:start
It does sound like it
would be interesting.

02:35:05.329 --> 02:35:09.066 position:10% line:83% align:start
But I'm gonna have to pass,
because as much as I hate

02:35:09.100 --> 02:35:10.501 position:30% line:83% align:start
to say it, I'm
not a team player.

02:35:20.244 --> 02:35:22.013 position:7% line:89% align:start
-Well, the kid shot you down.

02:35:22.046 --> 02:35:23.080 position:35% line:89% align:start
Now what?

02:35:23.114 --> 02:35:25.016 position:27% line:89% align:start
-Another thing.

02:35:25.049 --> 02:35:27.885 position:13% line:83% align:start
Section 9 will resume work
as an anti crime unit.

02:35:27.918 --> 02:35:31.389 position:10% line:83% align:start
It'll remain that way for as
long as you and I want it to.

02:35:31.422 --> 02:35:32.323 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's all, Major.

02:35:55.247 --> 02:35:59.850 position:16% line:83% align:start
Major, assemble the team
with an A2 load out.

02:35:59.884 --> 02:36:00.918 position:5% line:89% align:start
KUSANAGI: Batou, you copy that?

02:36:04.889 --> 02:36:05.856 position:16% line:89% align:start
BATOU: You need a lift?

02:36:08.627 --> 02:36:11.563 position:24% line:89% align:start
KUSANAGI: Togusa.

02:36:11.596 --> 02:36:13.532 position:7% line:89% align:start
TOGUSA: I'm already on my way.

02:36:13.565 --> 02:36:14.299 position:21% line:89% align:start
KUSANAGI: Ishikawa.

02:36:14.333 --> 02:36:15.901 position:41% line:89% align:start
Saito.

02:36:15.934 --> 02:36:17.002 position:13% line:83% align:start
SAITO: I'll go separately
and meet up with you.

02:36:21.239 --> 02:36:24.176 position:13% line:89% align:start
ISHIKAWA: Ready on my end.

02:36:24.209 --> 02:36:25.043 position:33% line:89% align:start
BATOU: Pazu.

02:36:25.077 --> 02:36:26.044 position:41% line:89% align:start
Borma.

02:36:26.078 --> 02:36:27.512 position:13% line:89% align:start
PAZU: Just give the word.

02:36:27.546 --> 02:36:29.549 position:21% line:83% align:start
BORMA: We've got to
get lucky sometime.

02:36:41.494 --> 02:36:43.496 position:27% line:89% align:start
