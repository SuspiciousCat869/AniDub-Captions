00:11:30.691 --> 00:11:32.960 position:27% line:83% align:start
They're probably
the real targets.

00:11:32.993 --> 00:11:35.361 position:19% line:83% align:start
[BORMA] We're screwed
if they open that door.

00:11:35.394 --> 00:11:36.964 position:19% line:83% align:start
They'll either hole up
in there for months

00:11:36.997 --> 00:11:39.833 position:27% line:83% align:start
or start staging
public executions.

00:11:39.867 --> 00:11:41.434 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MOTOKO]
What are their demands?

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:43.369 position:7% line:83% align:start
[PAZ] They want the government
to keep the Ministry

00:11:43.402 --> 00:11:44.972 position:10% line:89% align:start
and suspend military trials.

00:11:45.005 --> 00:11:47.074 position:19% line:83% align:start
They don't care about
their own safety.

00:11:47.107 --> 00:11:48.208 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MOTOKO]
If they want to make

00:11:48.242 --> 00:11:50.944 position:16% line:83% align:start
a little battlefield for
themselves, we'll indulge them.

00:11:50.978 --> 00:11:53.080 position:5% line:89% align:start
Execute Domination on my signal.

00:11:53.113 --> 00:11:54.580 position:27% line:89% align:start
We're going in.

00:11:54.614 --> 00:11:57.017 position:30% line:83% align:start
Are you nuts?
Just the seven of us?

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.052 position:10% line:83% align:start
[MOTOKO] We've got a sniper,
cyberbrain hacking,

00:11:59.086 --> 00:12:01.054 position:5% line:89% align:start
and Logicoma to act as shields.

00:12:01.088 --> 00:12:02.823 position:19% line:83% align:start
The riot police at the
perimeter will keep away

00:12:02.856 --> 00:12:04.658 position:7% line:89% align:start
any potential reinforcements.

00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:05.391 position:33% line:89% align:start
We're fine.

00:12:05.424 --> 00:12:07.795 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TOGUSA]
Hmmph. You are the boss.

00:12:07.828 --> 00:12:10.063 position:10% line:83% align:start
[BATOU] Too bad this mission
doesn't call for ugly suits

00:12:10.097 --> 00:12:11.799 position:5% line:89% align:start
and old-fashioned neckties, huh?

00:12:11.832 --> 00:12:13.066 position:27% line:89% align:start
[TOGUSA groans]

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.368 position:7% line:83% align:start
[PAZ] Must be rough, being the
only one with a natural body.

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:17.704 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why not take this chance
to go full cyborg?

00:12:17.738 --> 00:12:18.404 position:30% line:89% align:start
[TOGUSA gasps]

00:12:18.437 --> 00:12:19.405 position:38% line:83% align:start
[BORMA]
It'd be a real pity

00:12:19.438 --> 00:12:22.341 position:16% line:83% align:start
to leave that beautiful
wife of yours a widow.

00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:24.978 position:5% line:83% align:start
[ISHIKAWA] Don't worry, I'll be
sure to collect your last words

00:12:25.012 --> 00:12:27.513 position:19% line:83% align:start
before your cyberbrain
gets blown away.

00:12:27.547 --> 00:12:29.616 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SAITO] And if you happen
to get tortured by the enemy,

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.385 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can be the one to end
your suffering for you.

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:34.520 position:19% line:83% align:start
[TOGUSA] Y'know what?
Screw you guys!

00:12:34.554 --> 00:12:36.790 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let's go! I got this!

00:12:36.824 --> 00:12:38.125 position:5% line:83% align:start
[MOTOKO] I brought you together
because you're all

00:12:38.158 --> 00:12:41.128 position:27% line:83% align:start
top-notch parts
in your own right.

00:12:41.161 --> 00:12:44.898 position:13% line:83% align:start
Still, like any part, I'll
purge you if you can't perform.

00:12:44.932 --> 00:12:47.634 position:7% line:83% align:start
So you can act like a bunch of
jackasses if you like,

00:12:47.668 --> 00:12:49.069 position:19% line:83% align:start
but most of you would
either be in jail

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:50.403 position:13% line:89% align:start
or end up shot in the back

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:53.674 position:16% line:83% align:start
if I didn't recruit you
for this squad.

00:12:53.707 --> 00:12:56.009 position:24% line:89% align:start
Don't forget that.

00:12:56.043 --> 00:12:59.378 position:24% line:83% align:start
Get into position.
It's time to move.

00:13:00.848 --> 00:13:03.917 position:19% line:83% align:start
[TOGUSA] So we're just
parts of a machine now?

00:13:03.951 --> 00:13:05.819 position:24% line:83% align:start
[BATOU] I wouldn't
take it personally.

00:13:05.853 --> 00:13:09.156 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm sure our darling princess
meant that as a pep talk.

00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:10.624 position:38% line:83% align:start
[BORMA]
She's a monster.

00:13:10.657 --> 00:13:12.059 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ISHIKAWA]
A gorilla woman.

00:13:12.092 --> 00:13:14.161 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SAITO]
She's gonna replace us.

00:13:14.194 --> 00:13:17.531 position:19% line:83% align:start
[PAZ] Just do the job,
we'll be fine.

00:13:17.564 --> 00:13:19.432 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TOGUSA]
Speak for yourself.

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:22.035 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna die
for sure out there.

00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:25.072 position:7% line:83% align:start
[ARAMAKI] We can't storm them
without more personnel!

00:13:25.105 --> 00:13:28.709 position:19% line:83% align:start
Where are the Rangers?
Or The Special Forces?

00:13:28.742 --> 00:13:30.510 position:30% line:83% align:start
[SUBORDINATE]
They all refused the job.

00:13:30.544 --> 00:13:32.012 position:19% line:83% align:start
Said they didn't want
to shoot their own people

00:13:32.045 --> 00:13:34.982 position:21% line:83% align:start
to save some foreign
war merchants.

00:13:35.015 --> 00:13:36.583 position:24% line:83% align:start
If they care about
their "friends"

00:13:36.617 --> 00:13:38.417 position:16% line:83% align:start
they can stop them from
committing crimes!

00:13:38.452 --> 00:13:42.856 position:5% line:83% align:start
Any squads associated with them
will be charged with conspiracy!

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:43.857 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, chief.

00:13:43.891 --> 00:13:46.026 position:7% line:89% align:start
You can stop negotiations now.

00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:47.027 position:41% line:89% align:start
Major!

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.228 position:19% line:89% align:start
I should have guessed.

00:13:48.262 --> 00:13:51.431 position:7% line:83% align:start
[MOTOKO] Sorry, but I'm going
to need you to stand down.

00:13:51.465 --> 00:13:55.135 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ah, so that suspicious
budget the council just passed

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:56.937 position:21% line:89% align:start
was for your squad.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.640 position:7% line:83% align:start
[ARAMAKI] It's not like you to
rely on politicians, though.

00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:01.008 position:27% line:83% align:start
[MOTOKO] I saved
myself some hassle

00:14:01.041 --> 00:14:04.444 position:30% line:83% align:start
by negotiating
with the top man.

00:14:04.478 --> 00:14:06.079 position:21% line:83% align:start
[ARAMAKI] "Under the
Prime Minister's authority"

00:14:06.113 --> 00:14:08.115 position:19% line:83% align:start
sounds good on paper,
but personally,

00:14:08.148 --> 00:14:11.718 position:16% line:83% align:start
I recommend a squad that
follows international law.

00:14:11.752 --> 00:14:14.721 position:7% line:83% align:start
We'd be a global rescue team.
Is that how you put it?

00:14:14.755 --> 00:14:17.691 position:24% line:83% align:start
Or a shell squad,
within the team?

00:14:17.724 --> 00:14:18.959 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ARAMAKI]
If it wasn't for the war,

00:14:18.992 --> 00:14:21.595 position:5% line:89% align:start
I would've set this up long ago.

00:14:21.628 --> 00:14:23.530 position:21% line:83% align:start
It would nip crimes
right in the bud.

00:14:23.563 --> 00:14:25.465 position:19% line:83% align:start
That means we wouldn't
have to suffer through

00:14:25.499 --> 00:14:26.967 position:21% line:89% align:start
incidents like this.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.068 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MOTOKO]
Nice thought,

00:14:28.101 --> 00:14:31.905 position:10% line:83% align:start
but I'll take an actual job
over your fantasy squad.

00:14:31.939 --> 00:14:33.840 position:19% line:89% align:start
When are you going in?

00:14:33.874 --> 00:14:35.175 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MOTOKO]
Twenty seconds.

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:36.977 position:7% line:89% align:start
We'll try not to kill anyone.

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:40.180 position:5% line:83% align:start
After all, we have to leave you
with something to do.

00:14:42.816 --> 00:14:46.753 position:16% line:83% align:start
She's like a child with
a very expensive new toy.

00:15:07.641 --> 00:15:11.878 position:38% line:83% align:start

All done here, Major.

00:19:09.383 --> 00:19:10.484 position:7% line:89% align:start
[MOTOKO] How's the panic room?

00:19:10.518 --> 00:19:14.222 position:16% line:83% align:start

but two guys are on their way.

00:19:14.255 --> 00:19:15.755 position:21% line:83% align:start
[MOTOKO] Batou and I
will box them in.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:17.792 position:13% line:83% align:start
Free the hostages and put
everyone you've captured

00:19:17.825 --> 00:19:19.827 position:33% line:89% align:start
in the hall.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.399 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you think we should
lend a hand in there?

00:19:25.433 --> 00:19:27.535 position:27% line:83% align:start
Only if you like
playing the clown.

00:19:27.568 --> 00:19:28.636 position:24% line:89% align:start
All we have to do

00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:33.174 position:10% line:83% align:start
is inspect the scene before
the central authorities.

00:19:33.207 --> 00:19:36.043 position:19% line:83% align:start
We had 200 people and
couldn't clean up this mess

00:19:36.077 --> 00:19:38.512 position:19% line:83% align:start
so now we get to watch

That's entertainment.

What's next?

Don't know what happened,

Hm.

That's strange.
Looks like we're missing one.

something on the comm line.

Put those down!

The hostages' cyberbrains.

They've been contaminated!

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.975 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MOTOKO]
The false memory virus.

00:21:48.008 --> 00:21:49.143 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's Fire-Starter!

00:21:49.176 --> 00:21:51.580 position:7% line:89% align:start
Give them the virtual vaccine!

Why can they move?

Found the intruder.

That's the host for the virus.

Hm.

at the same time

mess with domestic affairs,

there's probably a third party,

00:27:49.905 --> 00:27:51.506 position:24% line:89% align:start
Every single one.

00:27:51.539 --> 00:27:54.442 position:13% line:89% align:start
And I won't forget again.

00:27:58.948 --> 00:28:00.348 position:38% line:83% align:start
[OSAMU]
Right before he died,

00:28:00.381 --> 00:28:03.052 position:19% line:83% align:start
he issued some sort of
directive to me.

00:28:03.085 --> 00:28:05.620 position:10% line:83% align:start
Unfortunately, it seems that
someone jammed the signal

00:28:05.653 --> 00:28:07.589 position:13% line:89% align:start
and it didn't get through.

00:28:11.593 --> 00:28:12.828 position:38% line:89% align:start
Please.

00:28:12.862 --> 00:28:15.931 position:24% line:83% align:start
At the very least,
find out his final message.

00:28:15.965 --> 00:28:17.833 position:27% line:89% align:start
I have to know.

00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:23.005 position:38% line:83% align:start
[OSAMU]
Oh, and...

00:28:23.038 --> 00:28:24.673 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes?

00:28:24.707 --> 00:28:27.375 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you think we could
have dinner sometime?

00:28:27.408 --> 00:28:28.343 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MOTOKO]
Uh...

00:28:28.376 --> 00:28:32.647 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'd like to talk...
and not about business.

00:28:32.681 --> 00:28:33.983 position:27% line:83% align:start
There aren't too
many restaurants

00:28:34.016 --> 00:28:35.851 position:19% line:89% align:start
I can go to, you know.

00:28:45.027 --> 00:28:46.829 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MOTOKO]
Ishikawa, I assume you heard?

00:28:46.862 --> 00:28:49.297 position:33% line:83% align:start
[ISHIKAWA]
Yeah. I'm on it.

00:28:58.841 --> 00:29:00.643 position:38% line:83% align:start
[BATOU]
Want me to keep tabs on him?

00:29:00.676 --> 00:29:02.343 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MOTOKO] Just get their
Net like I told you to

00:29:02.377 --> 00:29:04.379 position:10% line:89% align:start
and mind your own business.

00:29:04.412 --> 00:29:06.715 position:19% line:83% align:start
What's he doing trying
to pick up girls anyway?

00:29:06.749 --> 00:29:08.083 position:24% line:89% align:start
His dad just died!

00:29:08.117 --> 00:29:09.785 position:19% line:89% align:start
And the Major? Really?

00:29:09.819 --> 00:29:11.821 position:30% line:83% align:start
It was prob'ly
love at first sight.

00:29:11.854 --> 00:29:13.722 position:27% line:83% align:start
He's a rich boy
politician's son,

00:29:13.756 --> 00:29:16.391 position:21% line:83% align:start
so he doesn't get to
meet her type every day.

00:29:16.424 --> 00:29:18.727 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's better to focus
on the job, right?

00:29:18.761 --> 00:29:20.696 position:16% line:89% align:start
Enjoy our new authority?

00:29:33.742 --> 00:29:35.144 position:24% line:83% align:start

It's been 900 hours

00:29:35.177 --> 00:29:36.979 position:7% line:89% align:start
since I last saw someone move.

00:29:37.012 --> 00:29:39.915 position:7% line:83% align:start
[MOTOKO] I heard that Unit 501
had been privatized,

00:29:39.949 --> 00:29:42.718 position:16% line:83% align:start
but I didn't realize it
was an automated factory.

00:29:42.751 --> 00:29:44.920 position:5% line:83% align:start
[TSUMUGI (RIGHT)] Everyone went
to work for Harimadara.

00:29:44.954 --> 00:29:48.824 position:24% line:83% align:start
What do you need?
A tour of the place?

00:29:48.858 --> 00:29:51.861 position:16% line:83% align:start
Do you know why Kurutsu
was at that meeting?

00:29:51.894 --> 00:29:54.429 position:27% line:83% align:start
[TSUMUGI (LEFT)]
For profit and for survival.

00:29:54.462 --> 00:29:57.032 position:13% line:83% align:start
Ambassador Wong and the PM
were working on an agreement

00:29:57.066 --> 00:29:59.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
to avoid any prosthetics
development dead-ends.

00:29:59.501 --> 00:30:01.670 position:7% line:83% align:start
[TSUMUGI (RIGHT)] The idea was
to keep production lines going

00:30:01.704 --> 00:30:04.139 position:10% line:83% align:start
by delaying the introduction
of new technology.

00:30:04.173 --> 00:30:05.107 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MOTOKO]
Why would you want to do that

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:07.408 position:21% line:83% align:start
when the government
provides research grants

00:30:07.442 --> 00:30:09.478 position:10% line:89% align:start
to keep development moving?

00:30:09.511 --> 00:30:10.679 position:27% line:83% align:start
[TSUMUGI (LEFT)]
That sounds nice in theory,

00:30:10.713 --> 00:30:13.549 position:5% line:83% align:start
but the technology is advancing
too quickly to be utilized

00:30:13.582 --> 00:30:15.484 position:13% line:89% align:start
by the current generation.

00:30:15.517 --> 00:30:19.688 position:21% line:83% align:start
Others weren't made
full-cyborg at birth like you.

00:30:19.722 --> 00:30:22.091 position:19% line:83% align:start
Dr. Kusanagi developed
your body with the concept

00:30:22.124 --> 00:30:23.659 position:35% line:83% align:start
of future
growth in mind.

00:30:23.692 --> 00:30:25.661 position:24% line:83% align:start
Rather insightful
of him, really.

00:30:25.694 --> 00:30:29.031 position:10% line:83% align:start
So what you're in here doing
is making parts, is that it?

00:30:29.064 --> 00:30:31.667 position:24% line:83% align:start
[TSUMUGI (RIGHT)]
Have to stay alive somehow.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:32.902 position:27% line:83% align:start
[TSUMUGI (LEFT)]
Technology conservation

00:30:32.935 --> 00:30:36.038 position:5% line:83% align:start
keeps numerous interests going,
but a technology revolution

00:30:36.071 --> 00:30:39.008 position:13% line:83% align:start
gives one group control of
an enormous market share.

00:30:39.041 --> 00:30:42.711 position:13% line:83% align:start
Kurutsu bet on the former
and was crushed by the latter.

00:30:43.746 --> 00:30:45.614 position:24% line:83% align:start
That would provide
a strong motive

00:30:45.648 --> 00:30:47.082 position:21% line:83% align:start
for the perp to kill
the ambassador

00:30:47.116 --> 00:30:50.419 position:19% line:83% align:start
and the Prime Minister
in the same hit.

the info in the access logs

[TOGUSA]
And no corpses, huh?

00:31:28.023 --> 00:31:30.059 position:19% line:83% align:start

[BATOU] Like they say,
dead men tell no tales,

We'd like to talk about
the PM's assassination.

00:32:17.039 --> 00:32:18.107 position:16% line:89% align:start
What's that data about?

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.576 position:30% line:83% align:start
Think of them
as last words.

00:32:20.609 --> 00:32:22.245 position:13% line:89% align:start
My comrades had no money,

00:32:22.278 --> 00:32:25.315 position:16% line:83% align:start
so all they could leave
behind was a message.

00:32:25.348 --> 00:32:28.117 position:7% line:83% align:start
They're programmed to be sent
when they take their lives.

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:30.186 position:21% line:83% align:start
And since they don't
have any family either,

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:32.588 position:19% line:83% align:start
they have their final
testament sent to me--

00:32:32.621 --> 00:32:35.024 position:27% line:83% align:start
an administrator
they've never even met.

00:32:35.057 --> 00:32:37.559 position:19% line:83% align:start

[SAWADA]
Colonel Haruyoshi Nada

00:33:05.321 --> 00:33:07.257 position:21% line:83% align:start
would probably have
the most clout.

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:10.126 position:13% line:83% align:start
He was an informal advisor

you can come by and talk, too.

00:33:19.735 --> 00:33:21.237 position:21% line:89% align:start
What does that mean?

00:33:21.271 --> 00:33:24.606 position:10% line:83% align:start

I'm grateful I can
work as a relay point.

some way to weasel out of it.

00:41:29.359 --> 00:41:30.761 position:13% line:89% align:start
So he wanted to test you.

00:41:30.794 --> 00:41:32.029 position:16% line:89% align:start
That is not what I said.

00:41:32.061 --> 00:41:34.431 position:7% line:83% align:start
I just thought we could build
some trust if we met for dinner.

00:41:34.464 --> 00:41:36.400 position:10% line:83% align:start
[BATOU] He told me this work
environment is unacceptable.

00:41:36.433 --> 00:41:39.803 position:10% line:83% align:start
No vacation, erratic hours,
unpaid overtime!

00:41:39.836 --> 00:41:42.139 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're making
this stuff up!

00:41:44.408 --> 00:41:45.375 position:27% line:89% align:start
[BATOU chuckles]

00:41:45.409 --> 00:41:47.544 position:30% line:89% align:start
[TOGUSA gasps]

00:41:52.349 --> 00:41:53.283 position:19% line:89% align:start
[TOGUSA clears throat]

00:41:53.317 --> 00:41:54.885 position:13% line:89% align:start
So, the Ministry Faction.

00:41:54.918 --> 00:41:56.820 position:21% line:83% align:start
The eleven guys who
took the hostages,

00:41:56.853 --> 00:42:01.892 position:5% line:83% align:start
Colonel Nada, and seven MIAs all
left the exact same testament.

00:42:01.925 --> 00:42:03.460 position:16% line:83% align:start
[BATOU] Meaning there's
still a group of them

00:42:03.493 --> 00:42:04.461 position:21% line:89% align:start
out there somewhere,

00:42:04.494 --> 00:42:06.863 position:19% line:83% align:start
lying low and waiting
for a chance to strike.

00:42:06.897 --> 00:42:09.466 position:16% line:83% align:start
Colonel Nada's testament
had an extra line, though,

00:42:09.499 --> 00:42:11.134 position:16% line:89% align:start
and it's a strange one.

00:42:11.168 --> 00:42:14.805 position:10% line:83% align:start
He said he "received a gift
from the Third World."

00:42:14.838 --> 00:42:17.541 position:10% line:83% align:start
Probably just his fancy way
of saying he got the virus

00:42:17.574 --> 00:42:19.209 position:16% line:89% align:start
from the broker, right?

00:42:19.242 --> 00:42:20.811 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MOTOKO]
No, it is strange.

00:42:20.844 --> 00:42:22.145 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TOGUSA]
Huh?

00:42:24.481 --> 00:42:27.484 position:35% line:89% align:start
[slurping]

00:42:27.517 --> 00:42:30.454 position:13% line:83% align:start
[ISHIKAWA] "Third World"?
Is it like an occult thing?

00:42:30.487 --> 00:42:32.489 position:10% line:83% align:start
[MOTOKO] Find out if anyone
at the Ministry of Defense

00:42:32.522 --> 00:42:34.825 position:7% line:83% align:start
or their affiliated companies
have used the phrase.

00:42:34.858 --> 00:42:37.361 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ISHIKAWA]
Hire some more people, damn it.

00:42:37.394 --> 00:42:39.329 position:27% line:83% align:start
[MOTOKO] I will,
if I find the right parts.

00:42:39.363 --> 00:42:41.198 position:19% line:83% align:start
[ISHIKAWA] Treating us
like machines, again?

00:42:41.231 --> 00:42:42.399 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MOTOKO]
Do you wanna fight about it?

00:42:42.432 --> 00:42:43.867 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ISHIKAWA]
Ask the rookie that.

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:45.268 position:24% line:83% align:start
He said he'd punch
you in the face

00:42:45.302 --> 00:42:47.204 position:5% line:89% align:start
if you called him a part again.

00:42:47.237 --> 00:42:49.740 position:19% line:83% align:start
[TOGUSA] Oh, come on,
does that sound like me?

00:42:49.773 --> 00:42:51.475 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SAITO]
Got a report for you, Major.

00:42:51.508 --> 00:42:53.543 position:19% line:83% align:start
Judging from the rifle
we confiscated,

00:42:53.577 --> 00:42:55.379 position:13% line:89% align:start
we're dealing with an RMC.

00:42:55.412 --> 00:42:58.749 position:10% line:83% align:start
Meaning there was no sniper,
just a remote-controlled weapon.

00:42:58.782 --> 00:43:00.584 position:16% line:83% align:start
[ISHIKAWA] So they made
the shot, used the virus

00:43:00.617 --> 00:43:02.619 position:19% line:83% align:start
and remote-controlled
that body all at once?

00:43:02.653 --> 00:43:04.321 position:27% line:83% align:start
They don't just
look like the Major,

00:43:04.354 --> 00:43:06.223 position:10% line:89% align:start
they've got her skills, too!

00:43:06.256 --> 00:43:08.492 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SAITO] Makes me wanna
kill 'em even more.

00:43:08.525 --> 00:43:12.729 position:24% line:83% align:start
Also, I feel like
somebody's been watching me.

00:43:12.763 --> 00:43:15.365 position:38% line:83% align:start
[BORMA]
Yeah, it's weird.

00:43:15.399 --> 00:43:16.901 position:35% line:89% align:start
So have I.

00:43:21.805 --> 00:43:23.640 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TOGUSA]
Uh, actually, me too.

00:43:23.674 --> 00:43:25.342 position:38% line:83% align:start
[BATOU]
Ape-Face, maybe?

00:43:25.375 --> 00:43:27.444 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MOTOKO]
No, I can't explain it.

00:43:27.477 --> 00:43:30.247 position:13% line:83% align:start
[BORMA] I found something
that might be related.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:33.383 position:7% line:83% align:start
You're gonna want to see this,
so come to my lobby.

00:43:36.486 --> 00:43:38.321 position:7% line:89% align:start
All right, blow me away, pal.

00:43:38.355 --> 00:43:40.590 position:16% line:83% align:start
I used a forensic search
program to reproduce

00:43:40.624 --> 00:43:43.961 position:7% line:83% align:start
the movements of objects that
got caught in the blast.

00:44:01.344 --> 00:44:03.580 position:21% line:83% align:start
[BORMA] This is pyro
reverse measurement--

00:44:03.613 --> 00:44:06.483 position:21% line:83% align:start
it's like replaying
the explosion backwards.

00:44:06.516 --> 00:44:08.251 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TOGUSA]
Not bad!

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:25.937 position:13% line:83% align:start
[BORMA] The bomb case used
fingerprint recognition,

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:28.773 position:24% line:83% align:start
so only the PM or
his aides could open it.

00:44:34.578 --> 00:44:35.880 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TOGUSA]
A surveillance camera?

00:44:35.913 --> 00:44:36.881 position:38% line:83% align:start
[BORMA]
It's military,

00:44:36.914 --> 00:44:38.816 position:19% line:83% align:start
but it's got a limited
range of transmission.

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:41.418 position:27% line:83% align:start
I tested it with
some white noise.

00:44:41.451 --> 00:44:43.821 position:16% line:83% align:start
[ISHIKAWA] It's only got
a cheap AI encryption, too.

00:44:43.855 --> 00:44:47.725 position:13% line:83% align:start
Here, I'll connect to our

00:44:57.034 --> 00:45:00.270 position:19% line:83% align:start
my sniper's itching to

[SECURITY MEN, AKIYAMA gasp]

00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:42.947 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm Akiyama. We're from
the Treaty Review Department.

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:45.883 position:30% line:83% align:start
I want to keep
this brief, okay?

00:45:45.917 --> 00:45:48.619 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKIYAMA] We captured her
on camera about a month ago.

00:45:48.653 --> 00:45:50.688 position:30% line:83% align:start
Brainwashing,
Ghost infiltration,

00:45:50.721 --> 00:45:52.790 position:13% line:89% align:start
false memory implantation.

00:45:52.824 --> 00:45:54.992 position:19% line:83% align:start
The Fire Starter virus
does it all.

00:45:55.026 --> 00:45:56.894 position:19% line:83% align:start
And this is the maniac
that sells it.

00:45:56.928 --> 00:46:00.463 position:5% line:83% align:start
She actually uses "Fire Starter"
as her handle, too.

00:46:00.497 --> 00:46:01.999 position:24% line:83% align:start
You approached her
to get the virus,

00:46:02.033 --> 00:46:03.701 position:7% line:89% align:start
and fell right into her trap.

00:46:03.734 --> 00:46:06.604 position:7% line:83% align:start
And then, because we happen to
look alike, you track me?

00:46:06.637 --> 00:46:08.039 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're such a fool.

00:46:08.072 --> 00:46:09.874 position:24% line:83% align:start
[AKIYAMA] You're a
super-wizard-class hacker,

00:46:09.907 --> 00:46:13.778 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'd be an ever bigger fool
if I were to ignore you.

00:46:15.713 --> 00:46:17.748 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKIYAMA]
Mm.

00:46:17.782 --> 00:46:20.483 position:21% line:83% align:start
It was two officers
that she manipulated.

00:46:20.517 --> 00:46:21.152 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MOTOKO]
"Officers?"

00:46:21.185 --> 00:46:22.286 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's a position--

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:24.789 position:16% line:83% align:start
someone who helps enact
the Prime Minister's policies.

00:46:24.822 --> 00:46:27.091 position:27% line:83% align:start
One of them was
Colonel Haruyoshi Nada.

00:46:27.124 --> 00:46:29.527 position:16% line:83% align:start
[BATOU] The guy who went
missing before the incident.

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:31.796 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKIYAMA] His job was to
isolate the radical elements

00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:33.564 position:10% line:89% align:start
within the Ministry Faction.

00:46:33.598 --> 00:46:36.701 position:10% line:83% align:start
Not the person you'd expect
to launch a terrorist attack.

00:46:36.734 --> 00:46:40.104 position:5% line:83% align:start
It was like he had a personality
transplant or something.

00:46:40.137 --> 00:46:42.506 position:30% line:83% align:start
Then he might
have been infected.

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:45.009 position:7% line:83% align:start
I doubt the broker would take
things that far, though.

00:46:45.042 --> 00:46:48.779 position:5% line:83% align:start
Some enemies of the PM must have
bought the virus at an auction.

00:46:48.813 --> 00:46:49.981 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKIYAMA]
Well, when I get their names,

00:46:50.014 --> 00:46:53.184 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll take them and
the broker down.

00:46:53.217 --> 00:46:54.952 position:7% line:89% align:start
So who was the other officer?

00:46:54.986 --> 00:47:02.994 position:7% line:83% align:start
[AKIYAMA sighs] Yoko Kitahara,
Vice-Minister of Defense.

00:47:06.163 --> 00:47:08.599 position:10% line:89% align:start
What is the meaning of this?

00:47:11.869 --> 00:47:13.204 position:33% line:89% align:start
Don't move!

00:47:13.237 --> 00:47:15.106 position:21% line:83% align:start
There is a protocol
to follow, here!

00:47:15.139 --> 00:47:17.642 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're under arrest for
unlawful investigation!

00:47:17.675 --> 00:47:19.911 position:24% line:89% align:start
Would you stop it?

00:47:22.613 --> 00:47:26.450 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

00:47:26.484 --> 00:47:28.920 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ARAMAKI]
Then let's hear your story.

00:47:32.089 --> 00:47:33.791 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ARAMAKI]
She was infected by Nada,

00:47:33.824 --> 00:47:36.527 position:19% line:83% align:start
and made to antagonize
the Ministry faction.

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:39.864 position:7% line:83% align:start
Namely, she manipulated public
opinion to favor their downgrade

00:47:39.897 --> 00:47:41.933 position:21% line:83% align:start
and laid off several
thousand troops.

00:47:41.966 --> 00:47:44.535 position:21% line:83% align:start
Was she involved in
the assassination?

00:47:44.568 --> 00:47:46.804 position:30% line:83% align:start
No, not as far
as we can tell.

00:47:46.837 --> 00:47:48.606 position:24% line:83% align:start
This was quite an
elaborate scheme--

00:47:48.639 --> 00:47:50.508 position:30% line:83% align:start
manipulating a
foreign affairs squad

00:47:50.541 --> 00:47:52.877 position:10% line:83% align:start
and the Ministry of Defense
from the inside.

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:55.146 position:27% line:83% align:start
The virus itself
hasn't been found yet.

00:47:55.179 --> 00:47:57.682 position:16% line:83% align:start
Are you sure this woman
isn't making fools of us?

00:47:57.715 --> 00:48:00.584 position:16% line:83% align:start
Any idiot could tell I'm
a victim in this mess, too.

00:48:00.618 --> 00:48:02.787 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why don't we all point fingers?

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:04.922 position:21% line:83% align:start
Obviously, somebody
manipulated things

00:48:04.956 --> 00:48:06.257 position:21% line:83% align:start
to make it look like
it was my setup.

00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:07.024 position:35% line:89% align:start
Excuse me?

00:48:07.058 --> 00:48:09.560 position:35% line:83% align:start
Who is he?
He's not Section 9.

00:48:09.593 --> 00:48:12.563 position:19% line:83% align:start
The name is Kuwahara,
he's an intelligence officer.

00:48:12.596 --> 00:48:15.032 position:13% line:83% align:start
The head of their strategy

And truth is the greatest

00:49:19.164 --> 00:49:20.664 position:24% line:89% align:start
the greatest trap.

00:50:05.676 --> 00:50:08.213 position:5% line:83% align:start
Vice Minister Kitahara said she
couldn't remember the details,

00:50:08.246 --> 00:50:10.881 position:10% line:83% align:start
but if she thinks this ghost

00:50:10.915 --> 00:50:11.849 position:7% line:89% align:start
might have some significance,

00:50:11.882 --> 00:50:14.852 position:16% line:83% align:start
then it's the best lead
we've got right now.

[BATOU]
If this is Nada's hideout,

[ISHIKAWA] Pretty sure
we took over the ship.

[BORMA] Wait, why aren't
they shooting at us?

00:58:57.610 --> 00:59:01.146 position:21% line:83% align:start
Isn't their goal to

But Major?

Of course, you can transfer

Did she purge herself?

She might've just cut us off.

I don't know if Kusanagi

Thanks for cooperating.

01:02:16.776 --> 01:02:19.078 position:21% line:83% align:start
We wouldn't want the
biggest scandal since the war

to go public, now would we?

01:02:35.561 --> 01:02:37.864 position:5% line:83% align:start
[ARAMAKI] Vice-Minister Kitahara
was assassinated,

01:02:37.897 --> 01:02:40.499 position:13% line:83% align:start
and Colonel Nada's status
is still unknown.

01:02:40.532 --> 01:02:42.869 position:19% line:83% align:start
That makes your claims
difficult to corroborate,

01:02:42.902 --> 01:02:46.505 position:10% line:83% align:start
especially since you've lost
your investigative privileges.

01:02:46.538 --> 01:02:48.041 position:5% line:89% align:start
Still, you can stay on the case

01:02:48.074 --> 01:02:50.777 position:30% line:83% align:start
if you become
members of Section 9.

Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

we should start?

01:03:08.194 --> 01:03:09.996 position:21% line:83% align:start
If the ship doesn't
give us anything,

01:03:10.029 --> 01:03:11.998 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'd look into anybody
involved in the case

01:03:12.031 --> 01:03:13.800 position:16% line:89% align:start
who refuses to testify.

01:03:13.833 --> 01:03:16.903 position:13% line:83% align:start
[ARAMAKI] Like Robert Lee?
The Far East trade rep?

01:03:16.936 --> 01:03:18.838 position:5% line:89% align:start
That one's a tough nut to crack.

Yes, sir!

I caught some strange intel.

01:03:42.795 --> 01:03:45.999 position:7% line:83% align:start
While back, a husband and wife
team of prosthetics developers

01:03:46.032 --> 01:03:48.735 position:7% line:83% align:start
went missing during a project
to avoid dead-ending.

01:03:48.768 --> 01:03:50.536 position:27% line:83% align:start
Did some digging
and it turns out,

01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:52.906 position:27% line:83% align:start
their bodies are
being kept by Unit 501

01:03:52.939 --> 01:03:55.975 position:16% line:89% align:start
for "research purposes."

01:03:56.009 --> 01:03:59.112 position:5% line:83% align:start
You better not tell me the wife
was about to have a damn baby.

01:03:59.145 --> 01:04:01.514 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is there something
I'm missing here?

01:04:03.016 --> 01:04:06.886 position:10% line:83% align:start
Think of someone who's been
a full cyborg since birth.

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:09.155 position:10% line:89% align:start
They're the Major's parents?

01:04:09.188 --> 01:04:10.723 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ISHIKAWA]
I wish I could tell you.

01:04:10.757 --> 01:04:14.928 position:5% line:83% align:start
The bodies are so contaminated,
they can't even be ID'd.

01:04:16.696 --> 01:04:19.032 position:13% line:83% align:start
[BATOU] The Major was born
without a body of her own

01:04:19.065 --> 01:04:21.601 position:7% line:89% align:start
and raised as army equipment.

01:04:21.634 --> 01:04:24.037 position:21% line:83% align:start
She really did have
nothing to lose.

01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:25.705 position:5% line:89% align:start
She was someone else's property

01:04:25.738 --> 01:04:29.042 position:21% line:83% align:start
without any hope of
achieving freedom.

01:04:29.075 --> 01:04:31.010 position:24% line:83% align:start
[BORMA] That's why
she was working so hard

01:04:31.044 --> 01:04:34.514 position:5% line:89% align:start
to go independent after the war.

01:04:34.547 --> 01:04:36.482 position:21% line:83% align:start
So your take is that
she's acting on her own

01:04:36.516 --> 01:04:39.118 position:27% line:83% align:start
because of these
parents of hers?

01:04:39.152 --> 01:04:40.853 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ISHIKAWA]
She's not that sentimental.

01:04:40.887 --> 01:04:43.022 position:13% line:83% align:start
They're probably secondary
to some bigger fish

01:04:43.056 --> 01:04:44.590 position:24% line:89% align:start
she wants to fry.

01:04:44.624 --> 01:04:46.225 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's not like I have proof,

01:04:46.259 --> 01:04:49.629 position:13% line:83% align:start
but it feels like she saw
something real bad on that ship.

01:04:49.662 --> 01:04:51.764 position:19% line:83% align:start
Bad enough for her to
purge every one of us

01:04:51.798 --> 01:04:53.800 position:13% line:89% align:start
without a second thought.

01:04:53.833 --> 01:04:56.035 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you're suggesting
she did that to protect us,

01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:57.103 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm not buying it.

01:04:57.136 --> 01:05:00.106 position:19% line:83% align:start
This is the woman who
calls us "parts" you know!

01:05:00.139 --> 01:05:01.908 position:27% line:83% align:start
She can call us
whatever she wants,

01:05:01.941 --> 01:05:03.977 position:21% line:83% align:start
all that matters is
how she treats us.

01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:07.680 position:16% line:83% align:start
I shouldn't kid myself.
Full cyborgs are parts, really.

01:05:07.714 --> 01:05:10.284 position:13% line:83% align:start
Gotta join an organization
to do maintenance for you,

01:05:10.317 --> 01:05:14.020 position:19% line:83% align:start
or you fall apart long

01:05:25.798 --> 01:05:28.201 position:38% line:83% align:start
[BORMA]
Where are you going?

01:05:28.235 --> 01:05:32.138 position:7% line:83% align:start
[BATOU] I'm not the kinda guy
who can just "follow his Ghost."

01:05:32.171 --> 01:05:36.075 position:7% line:83% align:start
If I can't see it with my own
eyes, then it ain't real.

01:05:38.845 --> 01:05:43.016 position:7% line:83% align:start
A giant ship, seven soldiers,
and two of those tanks.

01:05:43.049 --> 01:05:46.719 position:19% line:83% align:start
That sure was one hell
of an expensive trap.

01:06:14.814 --> 01:06:17.817 position:24% line:83% align:start
What the hell were
they all looking at?

01:06:31.631 --> 01:06:34.801 position:7% line:89% align:start
I thought maybe we could talk.

01:06:39.739 --> 01:06:41.175 position:35% line:83% align:start
[ISHIKAWA]
I know it's sudden.

01:06:41.208 --> 01:06:42.708 position:19% line:89% align:start
Thanks for coming out.

01:06:42.742 --> 01:06:45.212 position:16% line:83% align:start
So you want to work for

01:06:45.245 --> 01:06:47.980 position:16% line:83% align:start

[CHRIS (KURUTSU)]
Since the beginning.

01:28:54.744 --> 01:28:58.448 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've compensated for my
shortcomings with micromachines,

01:28:58.481 --> 01:29:01.383 position:16% line:83% align:start
and although I can't be
prosthetized myself,

01:29:01.418 --> 01:29:04.253 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have operated many
prosthetic bodies.

I couldn't take.

you'll see that the diversity

goodbye before she moved on?

How could you have allowed
this all these years?

01:30:51.126 --> 01:30:52.462 position:21% line:89% align:start
Because we had hope,

01:30:52.495 --> 01:30:54.264 position:5% line:89% align:start
two hopes to avert the dead-end

01:30:54.297 --> 01:30:56.833 position:24% line:83% align:start
of cyberbrains and
prosthetic bodies.

01:30:56.866 --> 01:30:59.235 position:21% line:83% align:start
It was either going
to be her or you.

01:30:59.269 --> 01:31:01.838 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's that simple.

There's nothing to be gained.

been a dead man himself.

Can you take us with you?

Where are we supposed to go now?

for the sake of some
uniform standard?

01:31:31.734 --> 01:31:35.605 position:19% line:83% align:start
Sacrificing those less
fortunate than you are?

01:31:35.638 --> 01:31:37.340 position:27% line:83% align:start
You've all been
given cyberbrains,

01:31:37.373 --> 01:31:39.509 position:21% line:83% align:start
and Ghosts to guide
your actions.

If you want something
from others,

01:31:41.411 --> 01:31:44.447 position:13% line:83% align:start
you have to find something

I would hate to see
the aristocracy starve

nation fails to serve.

[ITO] Well, the slave trade
always benefits
