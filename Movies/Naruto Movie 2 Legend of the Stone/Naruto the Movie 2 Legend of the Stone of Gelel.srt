‐I’m the elder of this caravan.

174
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,558
The name’s Kahiko.

175
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,523
‐Caravan?

176
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,691
‐That’s right, young one.

177
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:05,861
The villages refer to
us as the nomadic tribe.

178
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:09,363
We travel near and far,
as the seasons dictate.

179
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:09,647
Have for centuries.

180
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,737
h yeah?

181
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,783
‐Fortune was smiling
on you, my boy.

182
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,366
If we hadn’t been passing
by the moment we did,

183
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,752
the river would’ve watched
the two of you away.

184
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,043
‐Hey!

185
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,706
It’s you!

186
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:27,916
[growling]

187
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,087
‐Hey, he’s regained
consciousness as well.

188
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,719
You, you jerk!

189
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,305
What the hell was that
all about back there?

190
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,640
What did I ever do to you?

191
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,024
‐[whimpering]

192
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:44,232
‐Well now, it’s good to see
you’ve got your energy back,

193
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:44,655
son.

194

‐[screaming]

195
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,858
‐Let’s not have any
fighting, shall we?

196
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,403
When traveling together, our
differences are put aside.

197
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:54,319
‐Yeah, but gramps,
this guy‐‐ huh?

198
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,236
Huh?

199
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,239
You again?

200
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,368
Why I oughtta‐‐

[music playing]

202
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,722
‐‐[chuckling] My
recovery time is crazy.

203
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:18,262
Most of my injuries
heal in a day.

204
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,177
‐Must be very convenient.

205
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,226
Your new friend over there
is pretty impressive as well.

206
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:26,441
Well, he’s healing almost
as quickly as you are.

207
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,272
‐Huh?

208
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:28,018
No kidding.

209
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,698
Hmm.

210
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,859
‐Ah, goodness.

211
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,117
I certainly envy your
youth, gentlemen.

212
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,054
‐Careful, old man.

213
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,682
That critter’s about as
vicious as they come.

214
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,970
‐‐[laughing] I know
Nerugui is a shy one.

215
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:02,016
But I’ve never known
him to bite anybody.

216
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,851
‐Wait, are you saying
you know this cat?

217
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,556
‐Indeedy I do.

218
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:06,905
It’s the first
time he’s ever been

219
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,609
separated from the caravan.

220
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,149
Isn’t that right, Nerugui?

221
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,694
I’m sure you’re glad to be back
safe and sound with us again,

222
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,437
eh?

223
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,357
‐Heh.

224
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:15,948
‐We all cherish him.

225
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,530
He’s our little treasure.

226
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,368
The truth, is I’m
actually the one

227
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,413
who hired the village hidden
in the leaves to find him.

228
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,246
‐No fooling.

229
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,960
So it was you, huh?

230
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,790
‐We move around all year.

231
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,245
We’re never in one place.

232
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,555
So we asked that he
be delivered to one

233
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,091
of the villages on the border.

234
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,422
How did you all wind up here.

235
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,838
‐Our team got ambushed by him.

236
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:41,969
KAHIKO: Hey, Nerugui.

237
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:49,476
‐Look at that.

238
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,653
Not so shy now, is he, gramps.

239
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,983
‐Well, how do you like that?

240
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,698
SAKURA: This area is
crawling with those guys.

241
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,538
SHIKAMARU: Yeah.

242
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:06,663
‐Who are they?

243
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,707
You got any ideas?

244
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,832
‐Beats me.

245
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,208
OK, Sakura.

246
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,094
You keep looking around,
and see if can find Naruto.

247
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,473
If he turns up, radio in.

248
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,299
‐I’m on it.

249
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,053
What about you?

250
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,344
‐I need to check something out.

‐Master Haido.

NARUTO: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

257
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:38,773
Hold up a second.

258
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,648
You’re saying this
caravan has always

259
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:41,944
been traveling like this?

260
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,107
‐That’s right.

261
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,025
The land we all hail
from was destroyed.

262
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:47,204
And we’ve been
traveling ever since.

263
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:50,083
‐Your whole country
was destroyed?

264
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,752
‐It’s an ancient story,
passed down through our clan.

265
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,083
According to the legend, we
had a beautiful homeland.

266
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,918
But it was completely wiped out.

267
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:58,713
‐Whoa.

268
00:22:58,794 --> 00:22:59,804
What happened.

269
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:03,719
‐Supposedly, there was a great
catastrophe of some sort.

270
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,179
Our home was lost.

271
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,219
And the people of our clan
were scattered to the wind.

272
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,804
From then on, we became a
tribe of wandering nomads.

273
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:13,888
KAHIKO: There were even some
of us who crossed the ocean.

274
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,938
‐The ocean?

275
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,561
‐Actually, Nerugui is
evidence of all this.

276
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,777
He lived among our ancestors
in the days of yore.

277
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,861
This little ferret
is living proof

278
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,904
that we had a country long ago.

279
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,570
‐[laughing] Ah, go on, gramps.

280
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,277
If that were true, he’d have
been alive a pretty long time

281
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,080
now, huh?

282
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,662
‐Oh, it’s true, though.

283
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,286
He’s no spring chicken.

284
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,625
‐Uh huh.

285
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:42,091
‐Nerugui is even older than
grandpa, if you can believe it.

286
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,262
‐Come on, give me
a break, will ya?

287
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,591
‐Hard to wrap your
brain around, isn’t it?

288
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:50,005
Our people have been looking
after him for generations now.

289
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,595
‐Hmm.

290
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:53,972
‐That’s why Nerugui doesn’t take
to anyone outside the caravan.

291
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,479
He stays amongst his own.

292
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,402
‐[squeak]

‐Uh.

296
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,115
‐At least I thought he did.

297
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,450
‐That’s the second
time he’s done that.

298
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,495
‐Nerugui, aww.

299
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:16,041
Are you OK?

300
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:16,291
What’s the matter?

301
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:34,845
‐Hey, are you ready
to talk yet, or what?

302
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,854
How come you attacked us out
of nowhere like that, huh?

303
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,268
Hey, I’m talking to you.

304
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:46,776
‐Uh, that power you
were using, what is it?

305
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,490
‐Huh?

306
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,569
What power?

307
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,034
You mean my chakra?

308
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:50,775
‐Chakra?

309
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,164
TEMUJIN (VOICEOVER): It’s true.

310
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:59,335
I don’t sense any
gelel from him.

311
00:24:59,456 --> 00:24:59,826
‐Come on.

312
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:00,575
Let’s go.

313
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:01,916
I want answers here.

314
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:04,841
Just who the heck are you, pal?

315
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,672
‐I’m here to build a utopia.

316
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:09,337
‐Uh, utopia?

317
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,586
‐That’s a very interesting
power you have.

318
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,597
You should come with me.

319
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,929
‐Eh?

320
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,934
Look, I don’t understand what
you’re talking about here.

321
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:18,887
‐Just think about it.

322
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:19,938
‐Argh.

323
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,309
When pigs fly, I will.

324
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:23,525
Why would I go
anywhere with you?

325
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,477
I’m asking you why
you attacked me.

00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:27,377
MALE SPEAKER: Hey, hey, you OK?

340
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,921
‐What were you thinking?

341
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,795
Oh, I can’t thank you enough.

342
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:44,139
‐Hmm?

343
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,309
‐I’m through here.

344
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,767
My debt to these
people has been repaid.

345
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:49,267
‐Oh?

346
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:11,003
‐Aw, come on.

347
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,380
There’s no end to them in sight.

348
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,304
They’re everywhere.

like they’re conscious.

‐I don’t know how much longer
I can watch these brats,

352
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,131
you know?

353
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,173
‐Easy now.

354
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,006
Watch your temper, dear.

355
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,221
Lay off, will you?

356
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,643
‐Once the Stone of Gelel
is in our possession,

357
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,561
we’ll have no
further use for them.

358
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,642
Just have a little
bit of patience.

could sure use its power now.

NARUTO: [screaming] he
cut and ran, that jerk.

If you think I’m going
to let you get away,

364
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,405
you’re out of your
bleeding‐‐ huh?

365
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:56,652
‐How on earth could
this have happened?

‐What’s up?

367
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:58,356
Is there a problem here, gramps?

368
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,655
‐I can’t find Nerugui.

369
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:01,699
He vanished.

370
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:04,202
‐Does that mean he’s run
of with what’s his face?

371
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,454
‐Yes.

372
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,657
What was the point of
spending all that money

373
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,746
on the unparalleled shinobi
of the Leaf Village?

374
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:11,754
‐Hold on a sec.

375
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,133
We delivered him,
just as you requested.

376
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,423
‐Quiet!

377
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,924
I told you to deliver
him to the next village.

378
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:21,296
Besides, I just finished
telling you Nerugui is gone.

379
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,546
‐Look, be reasonable.

380
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:26,346
‐‐[sigh] If I knew this
was going to happen,

381
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,351
I would have hired those
legendary sand ninja from

382
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,933

383
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,188
‐Argh.

384
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:31,940
OK.

385
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,060
I get it already!

386
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,949
SAKURA (VOICEOVER): Naruto.

387
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,414
Someone’s been here.

388
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,124
Could it be‐‐

389
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,393
‐So I finally
caught up with you.

390
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,142
All right.

391
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:11,476
Just give me back the cat.

00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,140
‐[hissing]

00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,597
‐Why you‐‐ huh?

394

What is all this?

395
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:30,254
Who are you, anyway?

396
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,329
‐My name is Temujin.

397
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:33,326
Come.

398
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,417
I’ll introduce you
to Master Haido.

399
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,000
‐Uh, hey, hold on.

400
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:40,668
Wait up, will ya?

401
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:45,387
So who’s this Master Haido guy?

402
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,510
‐He’s my lord, and a
man of great strength.

403
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:51,267
You’ll see when you meet him.

404
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:51,770
‐Huh?

405
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,396
So what’s the deal with all
these big goons everywhere?

406
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,611
You friends with them?

407
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,940
‐They’re just soldiers who
are dedicated to the cause.

408
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,527
All of my comrades are‐‐

[ding]

410
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,898
‐I have returned, my lord.

411
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,322
‐Ah, Temujin.

412
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:43,572
Good to have you back.

413
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,541
You’re the one, aren’t you?

414
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,633
Temujin let me know
he was bringing you.

415
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:03,091
He tells me you possess
quite an interesting power.

416
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:03,673
‐That’s correct.

417
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,705
Allow me to show you.

418
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,012
‐What is this?

419
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,185
‐Stand and fight!

420
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,313
‐No, Temujin!

421
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,471
Stop this unnecessary fighting.

422
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,849
‐My lord.

423
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,814
‐Resorting to violence is
never the answer, my son.

424
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,568
Naruto, we have
traveled far and wide,

425
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:32,865
trying to create a utopia.

426
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,661
NARUTO: Wh‐‐ what’s a utopia?

427
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,536
HAIDO: Well, to put
it simply, a world

428
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,462
where there are no longer
any wars, and the weak

429
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:41,632
are never oppressed.

430
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,210
NARUTO: A world without any war?

431
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,007
‐Yes.

432
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,671
The land we’ve
traveled here from

433
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,639
is a far off continent,
ravaged by conflict.

434
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:54,641
War is an ugly thing,
a source of boundless

435
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:58,643
sorrow, bestowing naught
but misfortune on man.

436
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,688
Temujin knows this all too well.

437
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,563
He lost his homeland to strife.

438
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:07,148
‐So does that mean
you’re all alone, then?

439
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:07,645
‐No.

440
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,777
I have Master Haido.

441
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:11,993
‐When he was a boy,
Temujin was left

442
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,913
to survive in the ruins
of his shattered village.

443
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,703
I made a decision
when I found him.

444
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:20,998
I wanted to protect the
weak in any way I could,

445
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,924
to create a world where fighting
was no longer necessary.

446
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,220
That is our utopia.

447
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,721
It is my only dream.

448
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,513
For the sake of that dream,
I’ve traveled the world,

449
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,855
gathering believers.

450
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:40,181
It has taken time for us to
make it as far as we have.

451
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,060
And it grieves me to
admit, many noble people

452
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:44,938
have been sacrificed
along the way.

453
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,696
Tell me, Naruto, would
you like to join us?

454
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:51,819
We could use someone like you.

455
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:55,875
Together, we can make
the world a better place.

456
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:56,532
‐Hmm.

457
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,700
It’s not like it isn’t tempting.

458
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,577
But I’m going to
be Hokage someday.

459
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,035
So‐‐

460
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,075
‐Hokage?

461
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,168
‐Yeah.

462
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:07,051
That’s what we call the
top ninja in my village.

463
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:11,378
‐I see.

464
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:11,878
‐Tell you what, though.

465
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,757
I can’t go with you.

466
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,795
But I’ll do my best to keep
everyone happy back home.

467
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,057
How’s that sound?

468
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,468
‐Well, I’m sure we’ll
both do the best we can.

469
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:19,557
‐Uh.

470
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:22,443
‐Goodness me.

471
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:23,771
Who is your little friend here?

472
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:24,975
‐My apologies.

473
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,613
I spent some time
with a caravan.

474
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,571
And he took a bit
of a shine to me.

475
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:31,822
‐A caravan, you say?

476
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,573
My, isn’t that interesting.

FEMALE SPEAKER (ON

480
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,580
have a problem.

481
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:42,663
‐Tell me, what’s wrong?

482
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,247
FEMALE SPEAKER (ON
INTERCOM): The fleet

483
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,252
we sent to the land of
wind was annihilated.

484
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:46,786
‐The land of wind?

485
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,088
‐I’m on my way.

486
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:48,631
‐Hey.

487
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,463
Hold up.

488
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:50,378
What’s going on?

00:34:58,138 --> 00:34:59,388
FEMALE SPEAKER (ON
INTERCOM): Yes, my lord.

493
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,102
‐There’s somewhere I need
you to go for me, my child.

494
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:20,031
‐What the heck happened here?

495
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,191
Huh?

496
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:56,074
Huh?

497
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,724
‐Hold up.

498
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,342
What is this all about?

499
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,767
Well?

00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:31,438
KANKURO: Naruto, what
are you doing here?

502
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:32,733
‐Huh?

503
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,147
Kankuro?

504
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:36,615
‐You got it.

505
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,705
Thought you could
sneak up on us, huh?

506
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,910
You shouldn’t underestimate
the shinobi of the hidden sand.

507
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:43,954
‐I don’t get it.

508
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,075
What happened out here.

509
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:46,794
‐Oh man.

510
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,291
You didn’t know about this?

511
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:51,923
These people invaded the land
of wind from out of nowhere.

512
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,543
‐Are you serious?

513
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,920
We’ve had quite a few casualties
trying to stop their rampage.

514
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,758
Whole villages were
wiped out in the battle.

515
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:05,175
‐Tell me, is that the truth?

516
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07,855
‐Noble sacrifices
for the greater good.

517
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,484
‐Oh, please.

518
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,151
What you say and do are
two different things.

519
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,020
‐Look, sorry for butting in.

520
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:15,566
But I’m going to
take him out now.

521
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,530
‐Stay out of this!

522
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,359
He’s my opponent.

523
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:18,194
You got that?

524
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:22,408
KANKURO: What?

525
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:25,282
‐Those who stand in our
way will be eliminated.

526
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,787
‐Yeah, whatever.

527
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,384
Huh?

528
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:34,839
‐Temujin, you know you’re not
supposed to be here, you idiot.

529
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:38,669
Your primary duty is scouting.

530
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:39,917
‐This one is just
acting as a lookout.

531
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:43,429
There’s another
unit waiting nearby.

532
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:44,763
‐Yes, but‐‐

533
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,258
‐What’s get you so worked up?

534
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:49,057
‐We’re splitting, before
things get ugly around here.

535
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,651
‐Not so fast.

536
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,318
‐Nice of you to finally show up.

537
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:03,027
‐Oh, all right.

538
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,954
I guess we can play.

539
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:09,454
‐You fellas should
learn when to walk away.

540
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,787
‐This is crazy.

541
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:12,964
What on earth are you thinking?

542
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,881
‐I already told you, didn’t I?

543
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,879
If one hopes to
achieve a higher goal,

544
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,722
certain sacrifices must be made.

545
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:21,469
‐What?

546
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:22,431
Look around you.

547
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:24,969
Aren’t these your
friends lying here?

548
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,303
TEMUJIN: They are.

549
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,847
And like me, they were
willing to give everything

550
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,143
to bring about our
dream of utopia.

551
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,556
‐Spare me, will you?

552
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,984
If they are your friends,
you sure don’t act like it.

553
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:44,662
‐Heh.

554
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,489
You’re pretty good at dodging.

555
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,672
All you got is darkness, huh?

556
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:56,042
I am not impressed.

557

of those who stood
against us, doomed

560
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,061
to wander the land of death.

uses [inaudible] Jutsu.

562
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,229
FEMALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
Prepare yourself

563
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,274
for an eternity of anguish.

564
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,700
‐I hope you know what
you’re getting into.

565
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,410
‐Oh, I can handle it.

566
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,250
Come.

567
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:37,995
‐Sure.

‐Sand Shower!

‐What’s the matter?

571
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,090
Don’t you want to play?

Huh.

578
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,486
That was easy.

579
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:33,906
Huh?

580
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:37,332
[gasp]

‐Sand Burial.

‐There’s no use in struggling.

583
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:10,439
FEMALE SPEAKER: [cackling]
So that’s your game, is it?

584
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:15,321
‐Have to admit,
this girl’s no joke.

585
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:29,093
‐‐[laughing] I’m not
through with you yet.

586
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,633
‐So you can increase
your strength

587
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:35,725
by altering the
structure of your body.

588
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:37,225
‐You got it.

589
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,690
Let’s finish this.

590
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:48,734
Useless.

591
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:51,608
That’s not going to work
against my plasma ball.

592
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:52,606
Take that!

593
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,497
Pathetic.

594
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,955
Well, that takes care of that.

‐What?

‐Provided you still have it.

00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:03,814
‐You’re no match for me!

605

‐Think so, huh?

‐You should have walked when
you had the chance, sweetie.

‐Heh.

619
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,530
‐What happened to her?

620
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,701
Nice trick.

Now what?

I’m just a little
curious, is all.

They were talking about it
back in their stronghold.

‐So you think they need it to
achieve their goal, somehow?

‐The stone could very
well be their goal.

Well, anyway, it’s
no skin off our backs

if you don’t want to tell us.

00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:44,903
We’ve got a friend
around here to look for.

669
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:47,319
Come on, Sakura.

670
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:48,156
‐Yeah, but‐‐

671
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:55,707
‐Just a moment.

672
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:59,171
Is this friend you
speak of Naruto?

673
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,091
‐Wait a minute.

674
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:01,461
Are you telling us
that you’ve seen him?

675
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,545
‐Please help me.

676
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:05,011
I have no one else to turn to.

677
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:08,591
If we don’t hurry, something
terrible is going to happen.

678
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,969
‐What are you talking about?

679
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:13,886
‐[sigh]

680
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:21,226
‐If they were your friends‐‐

681
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:24,737
‐You don’t know
anything about me.

682
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:29,240
‐‐[whimpering] What
do we do, Temujin?

683
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,125
Everyone’s dead.

684
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:32,832
‐Don’t cry.

685
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,290
‐Yeah, but‐‐

686
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:35,793
‐A tragedy.

687
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,836
You two are the only
survivors of this village.

688
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:51,015
In a true utopian society,
this sort of misfortune

689
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:53,515
would never happen.

690
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,767
‐A utopia?

691
00:48:55,850 --> 00:49:00,060
‐It’s a world free of war, a
dream I’ve devoted my life to.

692
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:06,739
Amazing, isn’t it?

693
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:10,489
If I can only gather enough
of the Stone of Gelel,

694
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,454
I’ll be able to
this world entirely

695
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:17,125
of war‐‐ ugly, sorrowful war.

696
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:24,042
MALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): It’s amazing

697
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:28,008
how you’ve incorporated
the Stone of Gelel.

698
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:29,052
‐Think so?

699
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:29,423
‐Are you serious?

700
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:30,628
course it is.

701
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:33,678
I’m really, really proud of you.

702
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,354
‐I appreciate it.

703
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:37,524
‐I wish that I
could be like you.

704
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,891
I only have power
when I climb in there.

705
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,108
But our hearts are still one.

706
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:44,309
We’re friends.

707
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,690
Nothing can change that.

708
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:50,487
We mustn’t let other villages
suffer like ours did.

709
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:52,781
We give our all for utopia.

710
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,495
[beeps and static]

711
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:03,835
‐What’s wrong?

712
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,709
FEMALE SPEAKER (ON RADIO):
You blind little fool!

713
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,796
That caravan you were
traipsing around with

714
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,380
had info on the Stone of Gelel!

715
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:09,877
‐What?

716
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:16,013
‐So this lead, then,
has the trail gone cold?

717
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:19,058
‐I had Temujin head
out after them.

718
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:20,813
Well done my dear.

719
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:23,733
The day when he has failed
to meet my expectations

720
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,814
has not yet come.

721
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:27,898
All thanks to that power
he wields, fortunately.

722
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:51,213
‐What?

723
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:58,635
‐We’ve been waiting for ya.

724
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,562
What’s up?

725
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:04,102
NARUTO: You idiot!

726
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:06,898
Do you realize what you’ve
done to those people?

727
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:09,361
‐I have nothing
further to say to you.

728
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,151
‐Oh yeah?

729
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:12,154
‐Hold on, now Naruto.

730
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:15,906
You let me talk
to him for a bit.

731
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:16,740
‐It never occurred
to me that you’d

732
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:18,704
know anything about the Stones.

733
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:21,454
‐Never mind that.

734
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,909
Why are you after them?

735
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:26,079
‐They’re essential to our cause.

736
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:29,378
‐You don’t know the horror
those Stones carry with them.

737
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:32,881
They must never be returned to
this world, you understand me?

738
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:35,015
‐Save your lecture
for someone else.

739
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,311
‐[gasp]

740
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:40,761
‐It’s just as I thought.

741
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:43,928
hat is that light?

742
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,688
KAHIKO: This is a
crystal of Gelel,

743
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:49,149
the source of all life energy.

744
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:52,533
‐I know more about the
Stones than anybody.

745
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,610
‐That explains your
power of recovery.

746
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:57,567
How exactly did you come by it?

747
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,526
‐It was given to me,
by my Master Haido.

748
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:01,947
‐I see.

749
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:04,536
And is that the only Stone
you have in your possession?

750
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:05,792
‐Hmm?

751
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,174
‐That’s peculiar.

752
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,961
If you’re a descendant
of our clan’s ancestors

753
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:12,415
who traveled across the
sea, why wouldn’t you

754
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:13,964
know that, I wonder.

755
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,969
Was the Book of Gelel lost then?

756
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:19,551
‐What in the world
are you talking about?

757
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:23,057
‐In the days of old, it was
only the royal family members

758
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:27,020
that let our clan who were able
to fuse the Stones of Gelel

759
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,654
with the flesh of the body.

760
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:33,282
Naruto, I spoke to you
of this the other day,

761
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,739
how some of our
people took to the sea

762
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,659
after our country was lost.

763
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:39,359
‐Huh.

764
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,200
Now that you mention it.

765
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:44,835
‐According to legend, it
was the royal family itself

766
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:47,542
that left, taking
the book of Gelel,

767
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:51,675
and the last of the remaining
stone across the waves.

768
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,842
Temujin, wasn’t it?

769
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:56,841
You haven’t come
to a new land, boy.

770
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:57,835
You’re returning home.

771
00:52:57,925 --> 00:52:59,805
You and I are of
the same people,

772
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:03,135
both descended
from a single clan.

773
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:06,352
We know little of
the Stones’ origin.

774
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,853
But it seems that
in very early times,

775
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:12,857
a mysterious vein of
mineral was discovered.

776
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,400
Our ancestors were
able to refine it

777
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:17,646
in a crystallized form.

778
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:20,696
And they name the mineral Gelel.

779
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:24,161
A vast empire was
built on this content,

780
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:27,623
with the precious stone
as its foundation.

781
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:28,875
Wells never ran dry.

782
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:32,627
Livestock multiplied overnight.

783
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,300
And trees continually
bore fruit.

784
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:37,049
It’s even said that
they looked for ways

785
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,802
to stop all life from aging.

786
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,763
‐First I ever heard of it.

787
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,175
‐This was a very long time ago.

788
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:47,433
But as is often the case,
great however brought with it

789
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:48,728
unimaginable catastrophe.

790
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:54,059
People fought and quarrelled
shamelessly over the Stones.

791
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:59,738
And in the end, their power
was used to wage a massive war.

792
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,950
Mountain and earth
were ripped asunder,

793
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:06,743
until eventually the back
obliterated the empire

794
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:07,697
altogether.

795
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:10,156
SAKURA: How awful.

796
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,827
KAHIKO: Only a handful
of the young survived.

797
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:16,746
Our ancestors sealed
away the coveted mineral,

798
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:19,759
deep underground,
and vowed never

799
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:22,802
to revive the Stone again.

800
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,256
‐If it was really
that dangerous,

801
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:27,354
why didn’t they try to
get rid of it for good?

802
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:28,771
‐Because the Stones
can only be destroyed

803
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:31,429
by those of royal blood.

804
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,560
But with the royal family
lost to us forever,

805
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:37,766
we can only watch over
them, guarding their secret

806
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,938
with every generation.

807
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:42,567
The legends have
slowly faded away.

808
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:44,534
And one day, the
story of our past

809
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:46,205
will just die out altogether.

810
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:47,283
‐Die out?

811
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,697
Fade away?

812
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:51,996
Hearing all that, my resolve
is stronger than ever before.

813
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:55,582
Nothing will stop me from
getting those Stones now.

814
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:56,787
‐Why you.

815
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:58,547
Weren’t you even listening?

816
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:00,959
‐Power is power, nothing more.

817
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:04,008
The only thing that matters
is who’s wielding it.

818
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:07,144
‐The Stone is too dangerous
to the world of men.

819
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:09,971
It must never be woken
from its slumber.

820
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,808
‐Whatever power it
may hold, Master Haido

821
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:15,942
will use it justly.

822
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:18,231
War breeds only suffering.

823
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:21,315
But without someone
guiding us from above,

824
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:23,991
there can be no
end to bloodshed.

825
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:26,451
This is what my master teaches.

826
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:31,582
The truth of his words
is etched into my heart.

827
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:36,172
In the fog of war, my village
fell prey to brigands.

828
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:39,091
Those of us who
survived were orphaned.

829
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,339
But Master Haido took us in.

830
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:47,014
I want to grant him his wish,
to free this world of war.

831
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:50,104
My comrades and I feel the same.

832
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,560
No sacrifice is too great.

833
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:54,183
That is my only dream.

834
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:59,519
And I need the Stone of
Gelel to bring it about!

835
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,436
‐Huh!

836
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:03,785
‐He was faking us out
from the beginning.

837
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:05,281
‐No way!

838
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,652
‐All right.

839
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:09,528
You’re going to tell me where
the mines of Gelel are hidden.

840
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:10,028
‐I will not.

841
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:11,118
ou leave me no choice.

842
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:15,125
‐Ah!

843
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:26,225
‐That dirty‐‐ come on!

844
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,221
We’ve got to go after him.

845
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:30,141
‐Emina, do you think
you could tell us

846
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,560
where the mines of
Gelel are located.

847
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:36,889
‐I would if I could But
only my grandfather knows.

848
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:39,689
‐We could sure use a
ninja hound right now.

849
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:40,191
Huh.

850
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:44,443
‐Hey, you think?

851
00:57:26,902 --> 00:57:27,742
‐This is it.

852
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:42,965
I’m sorry for treating you
so roughly, little one.

853
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:45,135
Now go on.

854
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:31,667
[ping]

855
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:32,838
‐Well?

856
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:34,088
‐Everything’s ready.

857
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,137
‐Wonderful.

858
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:38,180
‐Let’s say we get
moving then, shall we?

859
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,007
‐Does he even know
where he’s going?

860
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:14,842
‐Doesn’t matter.

861
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:18,256
He’s the only shot we have.

862
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,808
‐Hey, an exit!

863
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:21,311
‐Whoa!

864
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,561
‐Naruto, do something.

865
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:31,476
‐Huh?

866
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:36,448
[grunting]

867
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:37,283
[squeak]

868
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:37,567
‐There he is!

869
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:50,246
‐You know this place.

870
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:52,547
Lead the way.

871
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:55,931
‐Follow me.

872
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:56,471
NARUTO: Hey!

873
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:02,934
You let gramps go!

874
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:03,346
‐Stay out of this!

875
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,451
‐What in the world is that?

876
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:31,126
‐Master Haido, the mines
of Gelel lie below.

877
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:33,093
‐Thank you, son.

878
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:34,551
I’m in your debt.

879
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:37,381
Because of all your
sacrifice, our utopia

880
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,137
is finally near at hand.

881
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:41,101
TEMUJIN: Yes, my lord.

882
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,969
‐Very well then, everyone.

883
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:43,556
Let’s get going.

884
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,810
SHIKAMARU: Hold on a second.

885
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:48,976
Sorry.

886
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,192
I hate to be rude, a and all.

887
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,153
But I had a couple of questions.

888
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:54,284
‐Master Haido.

889
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:55,899
‐Easy Kamira.

890
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:57,196
I’m fine.

891
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,490
A bit unsettling, though.

892
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:01,203
Good manners are such a rarity.

893
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:04,584
He’s not a friend of
yours, now is he, Naruto?

894
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:09,374
I’m a little puzzled, my boy.

895
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:12,129
We made a promise to
one another, did we not?

896
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:16,260
We swore that we do our best to
make this world a better place.

897
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,549
‐Whatever, pal.

898
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,255
You’re the only one who should
be explaining himself here.

899
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:23,433
‐What do you plan to do
once you get the stone?

900
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,263
What’s your end game?

901
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,518
‐What’ll I do?

902
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:31,852
Why I’m going to create a
utopia, a world without war,

903
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:35,148
where the weak will be free
from the weight of oppression.

904
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:36,483
‐It’s funny, though, you know.

905
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:38,068
Because it looks
like you’re doing

906
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:39,955
the exact opposite of that.

907
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:43,450
‐All that I do this in
the name of true justice.

908
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,953
‐And why attack an
innocent caravan?

909
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:47,196
Is that justice?

910
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:48,369
‐It couldn’t be avoided.

911
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:51,116
My children and I have
made great sacrifices,

912
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:56,048
you see‐‐ noble sacrifices,
necessary to finally create

913
01:01:56,171 --> 01:01:57,341
a world free of war.

914
01:01:57,422 --> 01:02:00,882
NARUTO: Hey, old man,
people gave their lives

915
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:01,427
for your dream.

916
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:02,641
Do you even care?

917
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,556
But in your book, they were
just a means to an end.

918
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:13,314
Is that all your fallen
comrades are to you now?

919
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:16,726
‐This is what it means
to accomplish something.

920
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,776
‐So you don’t mind that
these noble sacrifices

921
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:21,322
are your friends.

922
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:22,744
‐That’s right.

923
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:26,954
‐I’ve accepted it, as the
rest of my brethren have done.

924
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:28,237
‐It can’t be helped.

925
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:30,408
We share a common vision.

926
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:32,248
Each of us dreams
of a world where

927
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:33,582
peace is finally possible.

928
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:36,288
‐Then they’re not really
your friends, are they?

929
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:38,549
‐And why is that?

930
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:39,840
‐I don’t know how
to put it exactly,

931
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:43,763
but, but a friend, a friend
is someone that matters.

932
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,335
They should be the
most precious thing

933
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:49,308
in the whole world to you!

934
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:53,562
For the longest
time, I was alone.

935
01:02:53,645 --> 01:02:55,235
But I made friends.

936
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,443
And that loneliness went away.

937
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:59,185
That’s why I dream
of becoming Hokage‐‐

938
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:04,446
so I can protect all the
people who are important to me.

939
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:08,872
This utopia you talk
about, who’s it even for?

940
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:10,452
Dreams that don’t
include your friends

941
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,328
are nothing but garbage.

942
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,955
That’s why I’m putting
an end to all this!

943
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:21,457
‐Huh?

944
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:24,048
‐Old man, what do you
think you’re doing?

945
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:26,514
‐It’s time this thing was
eliminated from the world one

946
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:31,556
and for all, even if
it means our doom!

947
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,141
‐Oh no, [inaudible].

948
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:45,365
‐Eliminate the Stone?

949
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:46,988
That cannot be possible.

950
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:51,043
Dah!

951
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:52,501
He must know something.

952
01:03:59,085 --> 01:03:59,495
‐Ah!

953
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:06,592
‐Hurry.

954
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:07,716
I’ll catch up to you.

955
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:11,224
‐Master Haido, return
to the stronghold.

956
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:12,768
‐We’ll never make it in time.

957
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,229
Bring the stronghold with you.

958
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:21,321
‐Hey.

959
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:22,359
Huh?

960
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:24,074
‐Sorry, little boy.

961
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:28,034
But you’re going to
have to deal with me.

962
01:04:28,156 --> 01:04:30,366
‐Hmm?

963
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:32,032
‐You’ve got some nerve.

964
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,450
‐Naruto, go!

965
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:35,997
‐Right!

966
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,921
Here I come!

967
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,231
‐Where are we?

968
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:07,778
‐According to the stories of
old, the chamber of sealing.

969
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:10,624
Everything is just
as the legend says.

970
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,160
I’ve never been here
in my life, and yet

971
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,293
it all feels familiar somehow.

972
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:22,337
The images you see were
left here by our ancestors

973
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:23,629
when they sealed
this place away.

974
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:28,423
They depict the terrible
power of the Stone of Gelel.

975
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:30,508
‐What’s this?

976
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:33,553
‐A portrait of despair, perhaps.

977
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,968
The empire was
reduced to nothing,

978
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:39,269
like the picture
you see before you.

979
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,232
‐How promising.

980
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:42,732
Our search hasn’t been in vain.

981
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:44,694
It’s all we hoped it would be.

982
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:47,784
‐And you’re telling me you’re
not horrified by all this?

983
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,862
That ghastly picture proves it.

984
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:54,276
This kind of power breeds only
destruction, and nothing more.

985
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:57,909
‐People will always fight,
with or without this power.

986
01:05:57,996 --> 01:06:02,036
We, we shall be wielding
it for the greater good.

987
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:03,545
‐Is that so?

988
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:06,746
The Stone is further down.

989
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:11,128
But our journey ends right here!

990
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,467
‐Haha!

991
01:06:12,552 --> 01:06:13,972
Stupid little girl.

992
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:16,055
Your meddling will
get you killed!

993
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,981
‐Ah!

994
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:21,522
‐Yah!

995
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,024
‐Ah!

996
01:06:25,607 --> 01:06:27,477
‐Oh, come on.

997
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:29,817
What’s the matter, boy.

998
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:31,573
Show me what you got.

999
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:36,534
What happened to that
shadow technique of yours?

1000
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:37,489
‐Darn it.

1001
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:38,617
She’s all over the place.

1002
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:41,003
I can’t get a lock.

1003
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,960
What do I do.

1004
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:47,881
Think.

1005
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:48,634
Huh?

1006
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:54,339
‐How’d you like that?

1007
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:55,337
Uh‐‐

1008
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:56,350
‐Surprise!

1009
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:57,349
‐Ah!

1010
01:06:57,472 --> 01:06:58,682
But I blinded her.

1011
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:00,395
How can she be chasing me?

1012
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:02,637
‐‐[cackling] I can
smell your blood.

1013
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:04,557
That’s all I need.

1014
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:10,277
[howling]

1015
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:10,780
‐Huh?

1016
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:18,699
‐[cackling] No use hiding.

1017
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:23,545
[laughing] Where could you be?

1018
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:26,003
Nice knowing ya.

1019
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:29,214
[howling]

1020
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:31,505
[echoes]

1021
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:36,089
‐[moaning]

1022
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:42,062
I’ll kill you!

1023
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:52,986
[screaming]

1024
01:07:57,991 --> 01:07:58,411
‐Huh?

1025
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:11,094
‐‐[laughing] You don’t think
this will hold me, do you?

1026
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:14,010
‐You probably shouldn’t move
around too much, you know?

1027
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:20,393
‐[sigh] Huh.

1028
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:21,721
Oh, look.

1029
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:24,346
An escape route.

1030
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,274
Just kidding.

1031
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:28,814
Your shadow’s waiting for me
down there, isn’t it, handsome?

1032
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:36,948
[laughing] There’s more than
enough room for me up here.

1033
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:39,701
And your shadow still
can’t reach me, can it?

1034
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:40,412
Muah.

1035
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:41,451
Bye bye.

1036
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:45,374
Hey.

1037
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:46,335
Let me out.

1038
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:47,286
Let me out!

1039
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:53,173
‐Secret Black Move
Iron Maiden Two.

1040
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:54,206
Gotcha.

1041
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:56,917
‐It was just as I
planned, more or less.

1042
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,643
You saved my butt.

1043
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:03,812
‐Forget it.

1044
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:07,811
I had a score to settle
with her, anyway.

1045
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:09,845
You know, all these
exploding tags of yours

1046
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:10,729
are going to be a real
pain to get around.

1047
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:12,903
‐Don’t worry.

1048
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:15,572
Most of these are just
regular old pieces of paper.

1049
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:17,072
‐Really?

1050
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:22,831
‐How foolish.

1051
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:25,910
Did you seriously think
you’d surprise me?

1052
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:28,905
‐No, I suppose I didn’t.

1053
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:31,578
But I’ve achieved my
goal all the same.

1054
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:33,838
‐What?

1055
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:37,011
‐Do you know what the
design on this floor is?

1056
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:40,971
It’s an ancient form of
summoning Jutsu, used

1057
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:44,012
to call forth an
immeasurable power.

1058
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:44,847
TEMUJIN: What are
you getting at?

1059
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:50,228
‐Here we breathe our last!

1060
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:02,528
‐I’m not altogether sure
what he was planning there.

1061
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:03,865
But I’m glad I came when I did.

1062
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:06,700
TEMUJIN: Master Haido.

1063
01:10:06,828 --> 01:10:09,868
HAIDO: Temujin,
are you all right?

1064
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:12,366
‐Master Haido‐‐ how did you?

1065
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:18,088
‐Oh, I was using this.

1066
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:19,014
‐[gasp]

1067
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:22,800
‐[gasp] That’s a Stone of Gelel.

1068
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:27,425
‐‐[chuckling] It’s
just like in the book.

1069
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:28,767
Amazing, isn’t it?

1070
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:32,231
I can blow things away
without touching them.

1071
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:34,813
‐Are you referring
to the book of Gelel?

1072
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,937
‐Sorry.

1073
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:39,686
‐How did it come
into your possession?

1074
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:41,947
‐Ah, it’s funny, actually.

1075
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,741
I bought it from a peddler
on the side of the road.

1076
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:46,784
‐That is utterly impossible.

1077
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:48,199
I thought there was
something strange here.

1078
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:51,826
You destroyed this boy’s village
to get the Stone of Gelel,

1079
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:53,624
didn’t you?

1080
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:58,000
‐‐[chuckling] Oh, what is
the cause of all this doubt?

1081
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:02,677
My only goal in life is
to rid this world of war.

1082
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:04,929
How could you even
say such things?

1083
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:07,431
KAHIKO: One who truly
wanted peace would never

1084
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:09,355
seek out the power of Gelel.

1085
01:11:09,432 --> 01:11:13,602
‐I desire the ability
to put an end to war.

1086
01:11:13,728 --> 01:11:14,848
There’s nothing more
to it than that.

1087
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:17,517
Let’s see now.

1088
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:19,227
Where might those mines be?

1089
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:20,777
‐I can tell how black
your heart is, just

1090
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:23,400
by looking in your eyes.

1091
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:24,608
HAIDO: Hmm.

1092
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:26,699
I don’t even know
where to begin.

1093
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:28,913
Hmm?

1094
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:31,333
Could this really be it?

1095
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:36,997
it must be.

1096
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:38,786
The key that grants access
to the mines of Gelel.

1097
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:40,588
‐No!

1098
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:41,461
Don’t touch it.

1099
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:41,957
That isn’t meant for you!

1100
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:47,014
Nerugui!

1101
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:54,345
Oh, Nerugui.

1102
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:59,935
HAIDO: Oh, there was a
small stone in its mouth.

1103
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:01,984
The poor thing.

1104
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:04,698
Yet another noble sacrifice.

1105
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:06,611
Honestly, those who
stand at the top

1106
01:12:06,697 --> 01:12:10,697
have to make such
tough decisions.

1107
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:13,077
‐I’ve had just
about enough of you.

1108
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:16,422
‐Aw, it breaks my heart.

1109
01:12:16,499 --> 01:12:20,169
One more sacrifice for
the cause, it seems.

1110
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:20,673
‐Ah!

1111
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:28,640
HAIDO: I can’t control
my power very well yet.

1112
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:29,049
Hmm.

1113
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:30,138
Well, anyway.

1114
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:39,439
What do you think
you’re doing, Temujin?

1115
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:41,112
‐Forgive me, Master.

1116
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:45,070
It’s just, the mines of Gelel
are in our possession now.

1117
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:48,284
If we were to toss this
helpless old man aside‐‐

1118
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,914
HAIDO: That’s not what I meant.

1119
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:53,163
‐Huh?

1120
01:12:53,244 --> 01:13:00,714
‐Don’t stand in the
way of my target

1121
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:03,595
‐Uh, Master Haido.

1122
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:04,713
‐You heard me, lad.

1123
01:13:04,839 --> 01:13:05,549
You’re in the way.

1124
01:13:05,673 --> 01:13:08,053
Step aside.

1125
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:10,045
‐What the heck is
going on around here?

1126
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:20,396
‐Ah, this is
becoming so tiresome.

1127
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:24,071
‐[gasp]

1128
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:28,071
‐Temujin, what are you
just standing there for?

1129
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:29,074
Are you going to
kill them or not?

1130
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:40,424
‐What the‐‐

1131
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:45,049
‐You call this a
noble sacrifice?

1132
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:46,419
HAIDO: What’s wrong?

1133
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:48,837
Take care of them
like you always do.

1134
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:50,055
Hurry up!

1135
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:53,548
‐No.

1136
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:55,558
I’ve had enough.

1137
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,100
I can’t.

1138
01:13:57,183 --> 01:14:02,603
HAIDO: Ah, Temujin, I’m
very disappointed in you.

1139
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:07,610
You’re an inferior individual,
no different from your parents.

1140
01:14:07,735 --> 01:14:08,155
‐Huh?

1141
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:21,707
‐You really are a
pathetic little brat.

1142
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:23,461
‐But that’s impossible.

1143
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:31,628
‐[cackling] That’s right.

1144
01:14:31,759 --> 01:14:32,929
It was me!

1145
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:36,220
Such blindness, latching
on to the very man

1146
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:37,215
who murdered your parents.

1147
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:40,886
What an adorable
little pawn you are.

1148
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:42,477
‐[gasp]

1149
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:46,063
‐But now that I know where the
stones are, I hardly need you

1150
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:47,648
anymore, do I?

1151
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:01,371
‐Mas‐ter Haido.

1152
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:02,957
‐Die, you good for

01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:33,434
Oh!

1316
01:28:33,517 --> 01:28:33,807
‐Huh?

1317
01:28:33,934 --> 01:28:35,234
Sakura, wait!

1318
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:36,230
Darn it!

1319
01:28:51,243 --> 01:28:53,953
‐Naruto!

1320
01:28:54,037 --> 01:28:55,617
Where are you?

1321
01:28:55,705 --> 01:28:56,115
‐Naruto!

1322
01:28:57,999 --> 01:28:59,379
Ah!

1323
01:29:07,384 --> 01:29:09,764
‐Uh?

1324
01:29:09,845 --> 01:29:11,055
‐Whoa!

1325
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:12,179
‐What is this?

1326
01:29:34,452 --> 01:29:36,752
‐What the heck is
going on around here?

1327
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:39,962
KAHIKO: It was even more
powerful than the legends tell!

1328
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:42,341
‐Is sthat gramps?

1329
01:29:42,419 --> 01:29:48,759
It

1330
01:29:48,884 --> 01:29:50,724
‐Are you OK?

1331
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:54,262
‐I was tossed like a rag
doll, and practically crushed.

1332
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:55,889
I was sure my time had come.

1333
01:29:56,016 --> 01:29:59,476
‐So gramps, what happened?

1334
01:29:59,561 --> 01:30:02,521
‐The wastelands have
given birth to new life.

1335
01:30:02,606 --> 01:30:05,646
This happened because a
fraction of the stone’s power

1336
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:08,364
was able to escape when
it was just destroyed.

1337
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:11,745
That’s why I’m as fit
as a fiddle again.

1338
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:12,243
[squeak]

1339
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:12,905
‐Woo!

1340
01:30:12,991 --> 01:30:13,161
There’s my Nerugui!

1341
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:25,800
‐What is this?

1342
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:28,261
[gasp]

1343
01:30:37,933 --> 01:30:38,603
‐Temujin.

1344
01:30:51,404 --> 01:30:53,824
SHIKANOBU: Where‐ where am I?

1345
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:57,294
I’m still alive?

1346
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:13,128
I see these ruins.

1347
01:31:24,354 --> 01:31:25,614
Huh?

1348
01:31:29,651 --> 01:31:37,121
This is‐‐ It wasn’t a
picture of despair after all.

1349
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:43,540
[music playing]

1350
01:32:28,168 --> 01:32:31,918
‐Temujin’s part of your clan.

1351
01:32:32,047 --> 01:32:34,417
He should have stayed here.

1352
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:37,429
‐He’s heading toward
warring lands.

1353
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:39,262
‐Well, what can you do?

1354
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:41,177
That’s the path he’s chosen.

1355
01:32:41,264 --> 01:32:44,644
Besides, our destiny split
apart a long time ago.

1356
01:32:44,726 --> 01:32:47,896
His soul isn’t
tied to this land.

1357
01:32:48,021 --> 01:32:50,111
His home lies elsewhere.

1358
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:51,191
‐It’s going to be tough.

1359
01:32:51,274 --> 01:32:54,404
‐At least he won’t be alone.

1360
01:32:54,486 --> 01:32:56,896
He said that this
time, for sure, he

1361
01:32:56,988 --> 01:32:58,238
wants to create a
world free of war

1362
01:32:58,323 --> 01:33:04,333
with the help of
his friends. [sigh]

1363
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:07,292
‐Something wrong?

1364
01:33:07,415 --> 01:33:11,995
‐[moaning] So much for loyalty.

1365
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:14,667
I’ve been dumped.

1366
01:33:14,756 --> 01:33:18,626
[music playing]

1367
01:33:44,744 --> 01:33:45,124
‐Oh yeah.

1368
01:33:45,203 --> 01:33:46,163
Where’s Naruto?

1369
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:48,827
‐Well, I’ve been
looking for him.

1370
01:33:48,957 --> 01:33:50,207
But he’s nowhere around.

1371
