1
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:09,041
Colonel Strings to HQ.

2
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,375
Colonel Strings to HQ.

3
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,625
Time is 05:21.

4
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:15,416
Initiating target penetration.

5
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,583
Over.

6
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,708
Move out!

7
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,791
Dreams do come true!

8
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:35,125
Everywhere, from the
russet-colored deserts

9
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:36,708
to the azure seas!

10
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:39,583
Astro Technologies is the
company that's working to make

11
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,041
your dreams become reality!

12
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,708
Astro Technologies is
advocating a project which

13
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:48,000
will safely create oceans
by collecting massive ice chunks

14
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,375
floating in the orbit of Mars.

15
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:52,583
All we ask for is your support,

16
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:55,791
then we really can
make dreams come true!

17
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,750
Warning!

18
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,250
The anti-matter reactor
has overloaded.

19
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,041
Levels have reached
critical zone.

20
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,125
Danger!

21
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:23,708
All personnel,
evacuate immediately!

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,708
In the best interest
of humanity,

23
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,666
and for the sake of
our righteous goal...

24
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,416
You

25
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,041
must

26
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,416
die.

27
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,208
Th-the Third Project...?

28
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,625
Headlining our news today, a
distress call was received from

29
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:27,875
an anti-matter plant located
on an isolated island

30
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,416
in the Pacific.

31
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,708
In response, an army special
forces unit has been dispatched.

32
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,375
According to sources, robots
at the plant have rebelled,

33
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,291
resulting in the death
of numerous staff members.

34
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:42,333
The situation is apparently
now under control.

35
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,125
Hi, sweetie!

36
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,291
There's my dad!

37
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,041
Good-bye, Yoko, my dear.

38
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,625
You didn't wait long, did you?

39
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,000
Mm-mm!

40
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,791
Mister Oldman!-

41
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,916
Please remind your wife that's
she's supposed to give us a hand

42
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,125
with the school bazaar tomorrow.

43
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:11,625
Uh...

44
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,416
right.

45
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,416
Think mommy will do it?

46
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,583
I dunno.

47
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,875
She's not too good
with stuff like that.

48
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,208
Mommy, we're home...!

49
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,541
"Mommy?" Where are you?

50
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,625
...has now spread worldwide.

51
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:38,666
President Hemming
of the E.R.U.,

52
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,666
Earth Robot Union
has spoken out.

53
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,625
As head of Earth Robotronics,
leader in the robotics industry,

54
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,708
he comments.

55
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,625
The problem is
isolated to Second types

56
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,333
which are installed
with a fractal circuit.

57
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,666
-These are manufactured
only on Mars.

58
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,791
Therefore in light of
this terrible incident,

59
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,833
it is my sincere hope
that the Second types

60
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,916
with human obedience circuits
manufactured on Earth...

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,541
Oh, you're back.

62
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,708
Heh.

63
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:05,875
Hi, mom!

64
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,083
Hey, check this out.

65
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,458
Whoa...!

66
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,250
Happy birthday, Yoko.

67
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:23,041
Congratulations, Yoko.

68
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,208
Hn?

69
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,916
A token of my affection, Naomi.

70
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,291
Even mommy is
having a birthday?

71
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,000
Today, like me?

72
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,333
Uh?!

73
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:49,416
Yoko, those roses are
my way of saying thank you

74
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,416
to your mother for
this feast she made us.

75
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,541
Oh...!

76
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,083
Now I get it!

77
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,208
-Well I wanna give you a thank
you present too, then, mom!

78
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,708
Uh!

79
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,125
My birthday, huh?

80
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,833
Chicago Police today announced
that they have submitted a bill

81
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,208
to the Assembly.

82
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,666
It is intended to reduce
the number of robot officers

83
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,625
who have been deployed
to handle simple duties

84
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:47,791
such as parking violations
and accident clean-up.

85
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:51,041
The bill is expected
to pass sometime this week.

86
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,041
Now for a commercial break.

87
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,541
When we return,

88
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,958
we'll have a special live
interview here at Blue 5 Net.

89
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,125
Our featured guest
will be Colonel Strings,

90
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,875
commander of the 404th
Mobile Troops who raided

91
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,916
the anti-matter facility.

92
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:20,583
Welcome back, and now a
Blue 5 Net exclusive interview!

93
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,708
So, you were the first man
on-site during the raid,

94
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,041
is that correct?

95
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,500
Yes.

96
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,458
I was the very first one in,
and the very last one out.

97
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,583
Colonel, did you really think
the robots were so dangerous

98
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,083
that you needed to use
guns against them?

99
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,916
Aside from myself, the only
survivors were 8 of my men

100
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,708
and three of the
plant's personnel.

101
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,416
You can rest assured
that we did our best.

102
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,000
If you don't mind my asking,
who are you siding for?

103
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:44,666
The humans'?

104
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,458
Or for the robots'?

105
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,750
I follow my beliefs,
and I do what's right.

106
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,791
I know that humans are
humans and robots are robots.

107
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,958
Human rights are reserved for
us, they're not for machines.

108
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,666
Thank you for coming.

109
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,958
Our guest today
was Colonel Strings.

110
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,000
The vehicle we are following
is in violation of traffic laws.

111
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,333
We cannot pursue it any fur- 

112
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,708
Who the hell are you?

113
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:09,833
Lady.

114
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,416
I have some business
with the colonel.

115
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,208
He's in there, right?

116
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,791
Hmpf.

117
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,333
Sorry, at the moment,
the colonel...

118
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:19,125
is enjoying a refreshing drink!

119
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,625
What the...?!

120
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,583
Surprise!

121
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,041
Well, well...

122
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,041
a second.

123
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,166
Enhanced for
hand-to-hand combat.

124
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,708
Custom made.

125
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,791
You're not human, are you?

126
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,333
And you're s'posed to be what?

127
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,125
A mutant tin woodsman
wearing a full-body cast?

128
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,458
Hnff!

129
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,291
I was told if I bring back
your pretty little head,

130
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,791
I'd be given
a nice bonus for it.

131
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,208
My Dorothy.

132
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,333
Ow, that hurt!

133
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,125
-That damn thing's
really strong!

134
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,125
I only need your head intact.

135
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,625
Otherwise, I won't
get any bonus.

136
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,666
Mm?!

137
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,333
Think I overdid it.

138
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,666
Rank: Sergeant.

139
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,500
404th mobile troops,
reserve forces.

140
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,416
I knew it, he's one of
String's soldiers.

141
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,000
They sure planned this out.

142
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,291
Yoko...

143
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,958
This is taking longer
than I expected.

144
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,166
So, you're still alive.

145
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,125
The lost Third...

146
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,125
The Angel of Death
and Life, eh...?

147
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:52,791
Huh?

148
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,500
Oh, Kevin.

149
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,791
I'm up.

150
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,291
Anything happening here?

151
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,916
Not a goddamn thing.

152
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,583
What's that?

153
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,458
Oh, nothing.

154
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:02,833
Some fool mailed in a threat.

155
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:03,416
-Ooh!

156
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,666
Agh.

157
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,375
It's those darn Earth-lovers,
I'll wager you.

158
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,125
I guess they're pissed off
because they don't like

159
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:11,625
the fact that we make
high-impulse propellant here.

160
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,625
They say that us Martians
oughta learn to live with

161
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,458
the deserts and stopping
wishing for oceans.

162
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,291
Well, have a good shift.

163
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,666
Mm.

164
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,208
All set.

165
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,958
Get in there and do it.

166
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:05,791
Shit!

167
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,416
You're not gonna break
through the security here!

168
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,833
Give up!

169
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,375
Yeah, we'll head straight home,
right after we blow up

170
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,166
this facility and all the
rocket fuel stored here!

171
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,250
C'mon!

172
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,666
Is that all ya got?!

173
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,791
Shit!

174
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,125
Eat this punk!

175
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,958
All available units have been
dispatched to the location.

176
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,250
The number of casualties
has not yet been determined.

177
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,208
We're awaiting
the preliminary report

178
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:19,833
How are you?

179
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:20,916
Hurt bad?

180
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,958
Naw, it's nothing serious.

181
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,250
Good.

182
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,708
Man, you did one
excellent job in there.

183
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,625
Outstanding, really.

184
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,250
However, there are
some complications.

185
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,333
Huh?

186
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:40,833
The police department
just issued a statement.

187
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,000
They stopped the vehicle

188
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,125
with the escaping
terrorists were driving.

189
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:47,458
And they arrested the remaining
three were still alive.

190
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:48,791
It's just...

191
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,458
that the three they
apprehended were all robots.

192
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,958
They were what?!

193
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,541
How 'bout the ones I've killed?

194
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,375
Humans.

195
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,708
They were human?!

196
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,166
There was no way I could
tell in that situation!

197
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,041
I know, take it easy.

198
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,666
Our lawyers are gonna be with
you at the press conference.

199
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,375
The only words you have
to say are "no comment."

200
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,083
Got it?

201
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,458
You don't have to worry.

202
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,333
And really bandage those
injuries to make 'em look worse.

203
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,916
You're a hero who risked
his life in the line of duty.

204
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You're the victim.

205
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,000
Right?

206
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:19,500
Okay.

207
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,791
Come on!

208
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:33,708
Hi, Julian.

209
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:39,666
Boy, it's been a long time since
anybody's called me that name.

210
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,416
Hiya, Armitage.

211
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,875
You saw it, didn't you?

212
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,625
You mean the First Error, right?

213
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,791
Yeah, I did.

214
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,041
Tell me about it.

215
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,416
I'm not interested.

216
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,250
Why not?

217
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,708
Because I'm a ghost.

218
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,208
I couldn't care less about
events in the mortal world.

219
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,416
Julian!

220
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,416
Thanks...

221
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,708
Julian.

222
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,541
Judging from the situation,
Mr. Kevin Oldman merely

223
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,208
carried out his duty.

224
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,625
That's all.

225
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:11,166
Nonetheless, the three
human terrorists are dead while

226
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,208
their three robot accomplices
are completely unharmed.

227
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,125
Could you tell us if there's
a special reason for that,

228
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,375
Mr. Oldman?

229
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,500
We already covered this!

230
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,125
-I believe we explained it!

231
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,458
When faced with terrorists

232
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,250
who are ready use a liquid
explosive to break in...

233
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,583
there's no opportunity to
take inventory and sort out

234
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,750
which are humans
and which are robots!

235
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,958
I was asking Mr. Oldman, madam.

236
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,500
Sir, will you please
answer the question?

237
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,208
He's been through enough today!

238
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,958
Leave the guy alone, already!

239
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:37,916
Hold on!

240
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,833
Just a moment!

241
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,458
Mr. Oldman, tell us, are you
one of those robot fetishists?

242
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,916
Do you subscribe to
"Deep Robo" magazine?

243
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,416
Sir, do you use a robot maid?

244
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,666
Have you ever had
sex with a robot?

245
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,083
All of you, stop!

246
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:54,000
Robots only do what
they've been ordered to!

247
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,500
The humans are the offenders!

248
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,000
Is that your opinion,

249
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,041
or are you trying to justify
the killing of three humans?

250
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,958
...the main reason of Mr.
Oldman's sudden popularity.

251
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,375
He has gained tremendous support
as the vanguard of those

252
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,916
who advocate Robot Rights and
a new social order by opposing

253
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,250
the concept of human supremacy.

254
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,333
Furthermore, it is believed
that the incident will have

255
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,125
a strong effect on the
upcoming Chicago Summit.

256
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,000
The summit, which is
scheduled in two weeks between

257
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,625
Earth and Mars, will
address the Robot Rights bill.

258
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,000
Now, here's the opinion
of one analyst.

259
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,333
The question is, "should
robots be granted some of

260
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,541
the same basic
rights as humans?"

261
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,458
Most of Earth has been
against the idea,

262
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,916
while the more liberal
Martians have favored it.

263
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,750
Due to the split
viewpoint over this bill,

264
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,000
it was anticipated that
it would go nowhere.

265
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,166
However, the aftermath
of the First Error

266
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,458
slightly swayed Martian public
sentiment against the cause.

267
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:40,875
Now, this latest
incident appears to have

268
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:44,291
significantly revitalized
Robot Rights activism.

269
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,625
With that, our focus will
be on the potential affects

270
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,375
this recent event might
have on the nearing summit.

271
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,541
Well, you really did it
this time, Kevin.

272
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,333
Or...

273
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,250
should I say Ross Sylibus?

274
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,291
I'm sorry ma'am.

275
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,666
But all of the
robot doormen were let go.

276
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,541
Let me get those bags for you.

277
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,708
Hm?

278
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,000
Who are you?

279
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,375
You're Colonel Strings?

280
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,625
I just wanted to know why
you murdered those robots.

281
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:46,541
Why?

282
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:47,916
Murdered who?

283
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,916
I'm talking about all those
robots you just killed.

284
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,791
What?

285
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,083
Kill robots?

286
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,041
You meant destroyed,
now didn't you?

287
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,375
Oh, you destroyed
the humans, too.

288
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:00,291
You probably know that 18% of
that plant's staff was human.

289
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,708
You act as though
you were there yourself.

290
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:05,708
Hmpf.

291
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,000
In the best interest
of humanity,

292
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,041
and the sake of
our righteous goal.

293
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,875
You...!

294
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,083
You're a robot!

295
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,000
You filthy crap!

296
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:24,666
You get your rocks off
by murdering, you monster!

297
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,625
To cover up the existence
of the Third Project,

298
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,750
you slaughtered everyone!

299
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:29,916
Th-Third?

300
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,041
I dunno what that is.

301
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:32,750
Don't play dumb!

302
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:34,250
Hold it!

303
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:35,125
Uh?!

304
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:37,166
Hold it right there, Naomi...

305
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,083
Armitage.

306
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,166
Demetrio!

307
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,125
I can just see
tomorrow's headlines.

308
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:45,125
"Hero of the
First Error suppression,

309
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:47,833
murdered by robot assassin."

310
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,416
Demetrio!

311
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:18,250
Sorry to have exposed you
to such unpleasantness.

312
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:21,166
How is it that
you know my name?

313
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,333
Well, well, well!

314
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:27,500
Has life on the run dulled
your detective's intuition?

315
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:30,000
My name is Demetrio Mardini.

316
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:33,958
I'm the executive vice-president
of Earth Robotronics.

317
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:35,708
And if I'm not mistaken,
you are the daughter of

318
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:39,125
the great genius,
Dr. Asakura, correct?

319
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:40,958
Mpf.

320
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:43,250
I've so looked forward
to meeting you, Ms. Armitage.

321
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,458
-I feel quite honored.

322
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:47,333
My dear, welcome to Earth.

323
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:50,125
Enough formalities. -Shall we
get down to business, now?

324
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,791
I brought him, sir.

325
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:09,291
It has been quite a while since
I've seen you, Ross Sylibus.

326
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,500
Chairman.

327
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:15,875
There's a reason I've asked you
to come all the way out here.

328
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,000
I need a favor from you, Ross.

329
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,958
Uh, sure, Mr. Chairman.

330
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,375
I need you to go
to Earth on my behalf.

331
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:26,208
I want you to attend
the Chicago Summit for me.

332
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:27,916
Huh?

333
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,208
I need you to go, Ross.

334
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:32,333
As the representative
of Frederick Ohara,

335
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:34,916
acting chairman of the Martian
Development Foundation.

336
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,500
Please, you will go, won't you?

337
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:40,833
But sir...

338
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:42,083
why me?

339
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:47,166
To begin with,
the remarkable advancements

340
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,208
in robot production
techniques on Mars

341
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:51,333
have been driven by necessity.

342
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:53,458
The birth rate has been
declining drastically

343
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:56,208
ever since the fourth
generation of pioneers.

344
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:59,500
Plus, a labor shortage
for development exists there

345
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:02,041
That, in turn, led to
a need for robots to act

346
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,625
as partners who
we could depend on.

347
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:07,500
If they're to be our partners,
they need to be protected by

348
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:11,583
the law and given rights as good
citizens and good neighbors.

349
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:16,083
It's the only logical and
sensible outcome, isn't it?

350
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:18,958
However, it's an
outcome I can't allow.

351
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:20,416
Hm...?

352
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,875
The demand for more Seconds
to be imported from Mars

353
00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:25,500
is slowing down business
for my company.

354
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:27,333
And, if the Robot Rights
bill makes it through

355
00:25:27,416 --> 00:25:30,000
the legislature, the
situation will only get worse.

356
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:32,791
It could shake every
union to its foundation.

357
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:34,958
It's not in my best interest
as a businessman,

358
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:36,916
therefore I want prevent it.

359
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,375
So, you're spinning
a new scenario.

360
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:43,166
The First Error, the infamous
robot uprising, was fabricated.

361
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,666
Not quite.

362
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,166
The robot uprising was an
event that actually did occur.

363
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:50,416
 Mmm...

364
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,791
But since you
made it here to Earth,

365
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:54,416
I would imagine that
this old news to you, right?

366
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,291
I'm quite sure you
knew about it already.

367
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:59,083
I didn't just know it,
I witnessed the whole affair!

368
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:00,791
Now I carry the memories
of a Third who was

369
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:04,125
built in that plant, and
her experiences are in me!

370
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:05,625
I see.

371
00:26:05,708 --> 00:26:09,083
Fascinating how you robots
communicate among each other.

372
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:10,458
Listen to me.

373
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:13,500
Robots like you Thirds
live a very depressing life.

374
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:14,958
No one will
acknowledge you exist,

375
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:17,458
therefore you're
doomed to be forgotten.

376
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:19,291
What I intend to give
to you all is a clear

377
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:22,166
and specific purpose
in your lives.

378
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,833
The uniquely
exclusive ability...

379
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,125
To create human being!

380
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:28,666
Bull shit!

381
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,875
Why do you think the Thirds
rebelled when they were forced

382
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:32,250
to participate
in that research?!

383
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:33,541
Well, now I've heard everything.

384
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,041
-I can't believe you.

385
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:36,708
Why did your friends try
to escape from the most

386
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:39,750
wonderful place any where,
the perfect Garden of Eden?

387
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:42,291
Just hear me.

388
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:45,583
What a truly marvelous
operation I'm proposing.

389
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:47,958
You know, from time immemorial,
the most difficult task

390
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:51,000
has been the creation of humans
you can easily manipulate.

391
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:53,625
And now, it can be done.

392
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:55,916
We can make a cheap labor
force who will never complain,

393
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,916
or produce disposable soldiers
who aren't afraid of dying.

394
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Mmm...

395
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:02,041
or create people
designed simply to love.

396
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:04,583
The ultimate product,
wouldn't you say?

397
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:05,833
I see.

398
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:08,541
We're the pawns
while you play God, hm?

399
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,208
 No, no quite.

400
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:15,708
I'm content to have the power
of, say, one of his chosen.

401
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:19,041
And that's the reason you killed
the human staff members as well.

402
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:20,916
Yes, that's right.

403
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:24,791
You'll come with me?

404
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:27,291
Off to my Garden of Eden?

405
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:29,208
If that other Third's
memories are in you,

406
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:31,333
then you must understand.

407
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,208
I need your power, Armitage.

408
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:34,500
I need you...

409
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:36,750
The original 'Third...

410
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:37,666
Hmpf.

411
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,208
Go to hell.

412
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:41,083
Oh that's a shame.

413
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,958
Grab the woman!

414
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:52,291
What's wrong?

415
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:53,750
-You seem in pain.

416
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:06,750
What is it?

417
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:09,125
Don't like the
jamming functions it has?

418
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:19,958
Now!

419
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:21,291
Go on, take her!

420
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,958
What's wrong?!

421
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,250
The date's over.

422
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:36,083
You're just not my type!

423
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:01,958
Did she escape?

424
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:03,791
Or is she dead?

425
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:04,791
No...

426
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:07,333
She is a Third, after all...

427
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:15,208
Oh, I found a real beauty here!

428
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:16,916
This isn't some
consumer model you can get

429
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,375
on the assembly lines!

430
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:22,625
Hm, the skeletal frame
says, "Made on Mars."

431
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:26,833
Well, why don't we ask this
little stranger who she is...

432
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:29,416
Hm?

433
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,916
These are her most
recent memories...

434
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,583
I doubt that it misfired...

435
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:41,166
Oh, I see...

436
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,416
She took over its power systems
then must have activated

437
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,208
the gun's safety and its
proximity fuse at the same time.

438
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:50,916
Well, that's how you're supposed
to use telepresence abilities!

439
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,416
Hey!

440
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,416
Agh?!

441
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,250
Quit poking around
in my memories!

442
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:57,750
Sorry, I didn't mean any harm!

443
00:30:57,833 --> 00:30:59,416
Hello, my name is Mouse.

444
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,458
I'm a repairman,
and you my dear, are a mess.

445
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:03,500
You main autonomous
nerve lines and vital parts

446
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:05,625
are completely severed.

447
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:07,750
Trust me, sweetheart,
if you were to go to a dealer,

448
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:10,083
he'd tell you to forget about
repairs, part with the money,

449
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:11,708
and just buy a new body!

450
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:14,916
Unfortunately, I'm kind of
attached to this body.

451
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,250
Anyway, I need to move again.

452
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:17,916
Can you do that?

453
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,916
Can I?!

454
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,416
Why, I'm a technological genius!

455
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,708
However, it'll
cost a pretty penny.

456
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:26,208
Payment in Earth dollars only.

457
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:28,000
No IOUs.

458
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:58,375
We will soon be arriving
at the orbital station.

459
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,041
The following transfer shuttles

460
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:02,000
are scheduled
to leave from there:

461
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:06,041
Chicago, flight 102,
departing at 13:00...

462
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:08,750
Daddy, it's just like you said!

463
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:10,458
It's so pretty!

464
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:15,041
Yeah...

465
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:19,458
I need you to go
to Earth on my behalf.

466
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:21,666
We've labored long and hard
on the Robot Right summit,

467
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,750
and we've managed
to come this far.

468
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:27,208
Naturally, I had
planned to attend myself.

469
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:28,625
But...

470
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:31,166
In light of what happened
to you, I changed my mind.

471
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:34,916
Earth is quite nervous

472
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,458
about the rising drive
for Martian independence.

473
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:39,916
The prevailing
attitude is extreme.

474
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,291
They're threatened by

475
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:43,666
the pressure for the
Zephoria terra forming project.

476
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,250
And now they're telling us
to accept 40 million immigrants

477
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:49,000
during the 4th stage
of development.

478
00:32:50,666 --> 00:32:52,125
The point is, Ross,

479
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:54,291
Mars is a valuable
possession to Earth.

480
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:57,333
-It's a prized colony,
and they don't want to lose it.

481
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:03,583
Despite what the Earth is
saying, they need robots now.

482
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:05,666
Not just for
Martian development,

483
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,583
but for the future
of humanity, as well.

484
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:12,375
The robot Rights bill is
necessary for that future.

485
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:13,375
I agree with you.

486
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:14,041
But...

487
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,458
why me, sir?

488
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,166
Because, you're
the man of the hour.

489
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,416
You're the hero of Mars.

490
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,208
Oh, I'm sure you
didn't set out to become that.

491
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:28,083
But, like it or not, you are.

492
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:31,583
I would like to exploit your
standing to its utmost advantage

493
00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:34,458
in getting the
Robot Rights bill passed.

494
00:33:36,791 --> 00:33:37,500
Ross...

495
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:38,750
Face the truth.

496
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:40,666
You can't keep hiding forever.

497
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,083
And...

498
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:45,208
this provides a good opportunity
to ensure Yoko's future,

499
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:46,458
doesn't it?

500
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:49,250
Hm?

501
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:54,166
Let's just say, if you scratch
my back, I'll scratch yours.

502
00:33:57,458 --> 00:33:58,208
I heard that.

503
00:33:58,291 --> 00:34:00,000
-Whatcha got there, sweetie?

504
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:01,791
It's secret, daddy.

505
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:04,000
Uh...?

506
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,250
I hope we see mommy soon.

507
00:34:07,416 --> 00:34:09,958
And with only two days remaining
until the Chicago Summit

508
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:13,166
on Robot Rights convenes,
All Martian Spacelines

509
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:18,000
flight 102 landed today with
the Martian representatives.

510
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:21,583
Among the representatives
is this man, Mr. Kevin Oldman,

511
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:24,875
who is currently the
talk of the town on Mars.

512
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:26,166
So the man's alive.

513
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,791
...comments he made
after the terrorist attack

514
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:30,000
on Astro Technologies
only days ago...

515
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:31,791
Now I get it.

516
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:33,708
So that's what's going on.

517
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:56,666
Hmmm...

518
00:34:57,291 --> 00:34:58,083
Hmmm...

519
00:34:58,166 --> 00:34:59,375
I am a genius!

520
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:15,541
Okay, I've got a few
little things to do now.

521
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:17,833
Once I'm done,
we'll go look for mommy.

522
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:18,666
All right?

523
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,208
Mm-hm.

524
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,583
Before the opening of today's
summit on Robot rights,

525
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:49,208
the sagging stock of all
major robotronics companies

526
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:52,875
suddenly shot up,
and it continues to climb.

527
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:55,916
This uptrend is due to their
announcement that all robots

528
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,208
produced from now on will be
installed with a slave circuit

529
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:02,875
to guarantee loyalty and ensure
that robots will be incapable

530
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:04,708
of harming humans.

531
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:07,625
Stockholders are also reacting
positively to the hope that

532
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:10,208
the once healthy economy
of these industries might be

533
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:13,583
restored should the
Robot Rights bill fail to pass.

534
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:21,708
Are you Mr. Kevin Oldman?

535
00:36:21,791 --> 00:36:22,958
Maybe

536
00:36:43,916 --> 00:36:45,416
Welcome, Mr. Oldman.

537
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,250
-Would you care for a drink?

538
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:48,958
What's going on here?!

539
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:51,125
Where the hell is my daughter?!

540
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:51,666
Please.

541
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,875
Don't get upset.

542
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:54,791
She's fine, as you can see.

543
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:57,125
Yoko!

544
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,166
Why are you doing this to us?!

545
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,708
Because I want you to argue
against the Robot Rights bill

546
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:04,666
at the summit.

547
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,916
What?!

548
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,125
The reason is...

549
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:08,458
Well...

550
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:10,208
If I call you this,
you'll probably understand,

551
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:11,333
won't you...

552
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:15,000
Ross Sylibus?

553
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:16,833
How did...?!

554
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,750
I think you catch on
fairly fast.

555
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:24,208
If you vote against the bill,

556
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:27,250
your lovely little daughter
will be returned unharmed.

557
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:29,708
If you don't do as I ask...

558
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,000
It's entirely up
to you, isn't it?

559
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,000
It's now time for the vote
at the much-anticipated

560
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:40,333
Chicago Summit on Robot Rights.

561
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:43,666
Let's take you there live
via relay for the voting.

562
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:49,375
Ross...?

563
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:52,166
Ladies and gentlemen, we will
commence taking the vote.

564
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,541
All those in favor
of the new bill from Mars,

565
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:57,208
the Robot Rights bill,
please stand up.

566
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:00,416
What's going on here?

567
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:05,000
As expected, all the Martian
delegates have voted in favor

568
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:08,416
of the bill, while all of
the Earth delegates oppose it.

569
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,583
Once again, it appears that
the Martian bill will not

570
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:12,916
easily pass--
Wait a minute!

571
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,083
What's this?!

572
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,916
Mr. Oldman, one of
the Martian delegates,

573
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,416
isn't standing in support!

574
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,166
If he doesn't stand,
the bill will be thrown out!

575
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:20,791
He's up!

576
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:21,291
No...

577
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:22,458
wait!

578
00:38:22,541 --> 00:38:23,375
Ross!

579
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:25,708
He's approaching
the chairman...!

580
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:32,041
The vote is: three votes
in favor, four votes against,

581
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:33,625
and one abstention.

582
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:37,083
The delegates have voted,
the motion is denied.

583
00:38:37,166 --> 00:38:39,583
Mr. Oldman has
abstained from the vote!

584
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:41,583
This is a completely
unexpected turn!

585
00:38:41,666 --> 00:38:44,416
The bill has not passed!

586
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:48,208
Hmpf.

587
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:50,041
So, he abstained.

588
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:52,833
Well, I'll let this one go.

589
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,541
What's missing,
what am overlooking?

590
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:37,583
Or, are you telling me that the
ability to conceive life lies

591
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,750
only in the province of God?

592
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:43,666
Huh?

593
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:46,000
Hi there, DEMETRIO!

594
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,666
Do you want my data?

595
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:53,666
Just who is...?

596
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:56,708
Yes.

597
00:39:56,791 --> 00:39:59,375
Then I'll transfer over
some sample data for you.

598
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:00,625
If would like the merchandise,

599
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:03,458
please contact
Mouse Robot Service.

600
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:05,083
Your password is...

601
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:08,291
An informant, eh?

602
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:09,833
Interesting.

603
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:28,583
You're all set.

604
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:34,416
Please feel free to call upon
Mouse Robot Service at any time.

605
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,458
Now, you have
the last of the data.

606
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:39,291
Hold it.

607
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:41,208
Let's first have a look.

608
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,166
Hmm...?

609
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:53,500
So this is all of the
remaining data, you say?

610
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:54,666
That's bullshit!

611
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:55,541
This isn't all of it!

612
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:56,500
-You're lying to me!

613
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:58,291
No, no, I swear to you it is!

614
00:40:58,375 --> 00:40:59,541
Everything you wanted,

615
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:01,791
everything you requested
oughta be on the disc!

616
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:05,916
What I want is the data
on her ability to conceive,

617
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,625
you filthy vermin!

618
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:08,750
Wh-...

619
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:11,000
what?!

620
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:12,000
Where?!

621
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:13,166
Tell me where
you're hiding it!

622
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,625
I don't know what
you're talking about!

623
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:16,458
You think I'm holding back,
but you've got everything!

624
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:18,708
-I've never heard of this
data you're referring to!

625
00:41:18,791 --> 00:41:20,666
And if it's somewhere on
the disc, it's outta my reach.

626
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,500
-If you can't analyze it,
your system's obsolete!

627
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:24,125
-There's nothing I can do!

628
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:25,041
Don't screw with me!

629
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:26,208
I want the data!

630
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:27,791
I can't finish the
conception functions

631
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:29,708
with what little there is!

632
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:31,625
But that's impossible!

633
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:33,750
You should be able
to make an exact clone

634
00:41:33,833 --> 00:41:35,916
after copying the hardware.-

635
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,875
Something must be wrong!

636
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:46,541
You fail to render
the vital component,

637
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:49,625
and you call yourself
an informant?!

638
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:06,291
Huh?

639
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:14,458
Wh-...

640
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:15,666
what the...?

641
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,083
A-Armitage...?

642
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:33,916
They're just like her,
aren't they?

643
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,333
-At least 99% like her.

644
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:39,791
However, that last vital
component is still missing.

645
00:42:39,875 --> 00:42:43,083
Now, be reasonable, and
give me the remaining data.

646
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:44,083
I told you!

647
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:45,541
I haven't got any data!

648
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:47,041
I don't!

649
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:49,625
Don't you want to see robots
that give birth to children?

650
00:42:49,708 --> 00:42:51,000
Will you get real!

651
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:57,958
Well, he must have
a connector somewhere.

652
00:42:58,041 --> 00:42:59,250
Let's look at his data.

653
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:01,458
Rip it out of his memory bank.

654
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:23,708
Anything?

655
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:33,666
That leaves us with
only the little girl.

656
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,000
Dump this trash
in the bin, will you?

657
00:43:37,291 --> 00:43:38,250
Ow!

658
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:39,875
Aagh!

659
00:43:50,208 --> 00:43:50,833
Oh!

660
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:54,333
son of a bitch!

661
00:43:54,416 --> 00:43:56,708
I'm not gonna forget this!

662
00:43:56,791 --> 00:43:59,208
That dirty bastard's
gonna regret messing with me,

663
00:43:59,291 --> 00:44:01,125
I swear to god!

664
00:44:05,791 --> 00:44:07,625
Hotel Royal Greenhill.

665
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:08,708
I'm trying to reach someone

666
00:44:08,791 --> 00:44:11,000
from the Martian
Development Foundation.

667
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:13,166
I'm sorry, they've
checked-out already.

668
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,375
Mr. Kevin Oldman, as well?

669
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:16,041
No...

670
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:17,416
he isn't back yet,

671
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:21,208
so he's still registered
as a guest of the hotel.

672
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,458
Can I help you
with anything else?

673
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:25,750
No.

674
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:26,583
Never mind.

675
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:28,333
Thank you.

676
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:34,083
Ross, what's happened?

677
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:08,375
Hn...?

678
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,500
Sorry to keep you waiting.

679
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:20,458
My daughter, where is she?!

680
00:45:20,541 --> 00:45:22,166
I was promised that
she would be returned to me!

681
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:23,708
-Now, where is she?!

682
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:25,208
Relax.

683
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:28,375
As promised, you'll be reunited
with your daughter again.

684
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:31,666
In heaven, that is.

685
00:45:32,666 --> 00:45:35,208
You planned this from
the start, didn't you?!

686
00:45:38,708 --> 00:45:39,958
What the hell...?!

687
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:41,791
Move!

688
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:42,541
What's going on?!

689
00:45:42,625 --> 00:45:43,500
-Who are you?!

690
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:44,833
Police officer.

691
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:47,625
Well, formerly.

692
00:45:47,708 --> 00:45:48,875
Hm?

693
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:25,875
Christ, these
bastards are crazy!

694
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:36,791
Damn!

695
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:27,041
 Shit!

696
00:48:22,708 --> 00:48:24,791
The day Yoko was born...

697
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:26,916
I was overjoyed.

698
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,583
The happiest I've
ever felt in my whole life.

699
00:48:30,666 --> 00:48:32,750
But I was worried, too.

700
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:37,083
I was worried over the idea
that one day I might

701
00:48:37,166 --> 00:48:39,625
lose both you and Yoko.

702
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:47,291
I'm sorry that-

703
00:48:47,375 --> 00:48:50,791
I left you without a word.

704
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:54,083
But I couldn't rest
until I knew the truth.

705
00:48:54,166 --> 00:48:56,166
Because I'm a Third, too.

706
00:48:59,041 --> 00:49:00,375
And now?

707
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:03,666
Now I've gotten our own
precious child mixed up in it.

708
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:06,375
Some PTA mother I am!

709
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:20,791
Naomi...

710
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:24,291
Stop taking on every
problem by yourself.

711
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:34,791
We can change our names,
and forge new IDs.

712
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:37,583
But if we can
never escape our destiny...

713
00:49:37,666 --> 00:49:40,375
then we fight it. And the
reason we fight it...

714
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:41,875
For our Yoko...

715
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:43,833
And for us as a family.

716
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:48,625
Ross...

717
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:50,000
Our daughter's waiting.

718
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:52,000
Let's go get her.

719
00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:01,375
Thank you...

720
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:03,416
Ross.

721
00:50:35,916 --> 00:50:37,583
Your ID cannot be verified.

722
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:39,708
If you do not leave
within 10 seconds,

723
00:50:39,791 --> 00:50:41,916
you will be removed by force.

724
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:42,750
Ten!

725
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:44,000
Nine!

726
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,041
Eight!

727
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,000
Seven!

728
00:50:46,083 --> 00:50:47,458
Six!

729
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:49,833
The name's Armitage,
and I want my kid.

730
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:51,083
Move it!

731
00:51:24,291 --> 00:51:26,666
If you've harmed
a hair on my daughter,

732
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,291
I'm going to kill you.

733
00:51:31,375 --> 00:51:34,583
I'll be sure to keep that
in mind, my dear Ms. Armitage.

734
00:52:02,375 --> 00:52:04,833
Access the company
info of this building!

735
00:52:04,916 --> 00:52:06,375
Search: Demetrio!

736
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:12,500
That's it!

737
00:52:13,958 --> 00:52:14,416
Ross!

738
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,208
Do you hear me?

739
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:17,208
Yeah!

740
00:52:17,291 --> 00:52:19,375
Room 49, level 258!

741
00:52:19,458 --> 00:52:20,708
It looks like some sort of lab,

742
00:52:20,791 --> 00:52:23,833
but I've got
a feeling she's in there!

743
00:52:23,916 --> 00:52:24,666
Naomi.

744
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,375
I just contacted Mars.

745
00:52:26,458 --> 00:52:27,541
I've got a shuttle standing

746
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:30,458
by for us on an unused
orbital elevator!

747
00:52:30,541 --> 00:52:32,041
It takes off at 5 a.m.!

748
00:52:32,125 --> 00:52:33,666
That gives us four hours!

749
00:52:34,875 --> 00:52:37,833
Naomi, don't do
anything reckless.

750
00:52:37,916 --> 00:52:39,875
Those bastards
are after my secret.

751
00:52:39,958 --> 00:52:43,083
I'm not about to let them
get their hands on me so easily.

752
00:52:45,333 --> 00:52:47,083
Don't underestimate them.

753
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,166
Yes, dear.

754
00:53:10,208 --> 00:53:11,791
 What, it's him again?!

755
00:53:22,875 --> 00:53:24,750
You wanna end up
like you did before?

756
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:27,333
You're not one to catch on
very quickly, are you?

757
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,333
I'd prefer it if you
wouldn't destroy any more

758
00:53:32,416 --> 00:53:34,916
of my merchandise.

759
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,250
DEMETRIO!

760
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:38,541
Shall we discuss your situation?

761
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:40,291
Yeah, you can give me
my daughter back!

762
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:40,916
There.

763
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,333
End of discussion.

764
00:53:42,416 --> 00:53:45,208
Perhaps you should reconsider
before brushing me off.

765
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:51,916
Yoko!

766
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,375
You can't release her.

767
00:53:58,458 --> 00:54:00,750
I have the access protected.

768
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:05,541
Huh?

769
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:08,041
It's this one!

770
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:15,166
Shit!

771
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:16,958
This goddamn door is locked!

772
00:54:17,041 --> 00:54:18,416
Can y'get it open?

773
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,166
Impossible.

774
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:20,375
He's got it protected,

775
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:22,916
so my telepresence
functions won't work!

776
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,125
Ross, there's something else!

777
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:25,041
Listen to me!

778
00:54:25,125 --> 00:54:26,583
That's room's a freezer!

779
00:54:26,666 --> 00:54:28,500
What?!

780
00:54:28,583 --> 00:54:29,958
Yoko's in danger!

781
00:54:30,041 --> 00:54:33,375
I'll buy some time, so Ross,
you'll have to handle it!

782
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,750
That's better.

783
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:00,041
Shit!

784
00:55:28,916 --> 00:55:31,583
I ran some tests
on your daughter's body.

785
00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:35,958
I found nothing extraordinary,
no unusual abilities in her.

786
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,708
What a disappointment.

787
00:55:37,791 --> 00:55:39,791
Just a normal human child.

788
00:55:39,875 --> 00:55:40,583
Where's Yoko?!

789
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:41,833
-What've you done to her?!

790
00:55:41,916 --> 00:55:44,291
Did you hurt her?!

791
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:46,000
Hurt the child?

792
00:55:46,083 --> 00:55:49,208
My dear, I'm many things,
but not a barbarian.

793
00:55:49,291 --> 00:55:51,750
I simply extracted a small
amount of tissue and blood

794
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:54,250
for the testing samples
that I needed.

795
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:55,625
Relax, mother hen.

796
00:55:55,708 --> 00:55:58,125
I have no use
for an ordinary child.

797
00:56:12,833 --> 00:56:14,583
Papa?

798
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:17,833
--Where are you, daddy?
--I'm a lenient man.

799
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,583
I'm willing to forgive and
forget the considerable damage

800
00:56:20,666 --> 00:56:22,916
and rudeness that you and your
husband have inflicted...

801
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,958
on both my company
and me, as well.

802
00:56:26,041 --> 00:56:27,125
However...

803
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:28,541
that all depends on
whether you tell me

804
00:56:28,625 --> 00:56:31,250
what the secret
of the Thirds is.

805
00:56:31,958 --> 00:56:33,625
Daddy?

806
00:56:36,541 --> 00:56:39,833
The secret of your
ability to conceive life.

807
00:56:43,916 --> 00:56:45,583
Secret?

808
00:56:45,666 --> 00:56:47,791
Do you really want to know?

809
00:56:49,875 --> 00:56:51,000
All right.

810
00:56:51,083 --> 00:56:52,958
-Then do you want me
to show it to you now?

811
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:54,833
You really will?

812
00:56:58,041 --> 00:57:00,208
Please come a little closer.

813
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:04,000
Closer...

814
00:57:06,041 --> 00:57:07,833
Good...

815
00:57:07,916 --> 00:57:09,375
Right there.

816
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:21,500
Wait!

817
00:57:21,583 --> 00:57:24,750
You apparently don't understand
the position that you're in.

818
00:57:24,833 --> 00:57:26,333
If you're willing
to cooperate with me,

819
00:57:26,416 --> 00:57:28,000
then you can walk
right out of here.

820
00:57:28,083 --> 00:57:29,791
Or I can shut your loud mouth
permanently by separating

821
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:33,458
that cute skull of yours from
its well-manufactured torso!

822
00:57:33,541 --> 00:57:34,875
Be my guest.

823
00:57:34,958 --> 00:57:36,166
-But if you did that,
you'd lose the secret forever,

824
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:37,791
wouldn't you, bright boy?

825
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:39,875
You foolish man.

826
00:57:39,958 --> 00:57:42,833
There is a power to create life
that exists within every woman,

827
00:57:42,916 --> 00:57:44,500
but you don't know
where to find it?

828
00:57:44,583 --> 00:57:45,750
What?

829
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:47,333
In her heart!

830
00:57:47,416 --> 00:57:50,666
Making children takes more
than just a female body form!

831
00:57:55,708 --> 00:57:57,375
The love a mother feels
for someone!

832
00:57:57,458 --> 00:57:58,833
Her need to protect them!

833
00:57:58,916 --> 00:58:01,625
The need to pass those
feelings on to the future...

834
00:58:01,708 --> 00:58:03,833
That's what creating
a life is all about!

835
00:58:09,958 --> 00:58:12,291
That's something
you'll never understand!

836
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:16,875
Surely, it's the
software, isn't it?

837
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:18,916
I know that's it.

838
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:23,375
After her!

839
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:54,625
Who the hell are you two?!

840
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:15,916
Replicas...?

841
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,958
Do poor-quality knock-offs
like you really believe

842
00:59:18,041 --> 00:59:19,750
they can trash the original?

843
00:59:44,625 --> 00:59:46,041
Mommy!

844
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:48,291
Yoko!

845
00:59:48,375 --> 00:59:50,333
Mommy!

846
00:59:50,416 --> 00:59:51,458
Mommy, I missed you!

847
00:59:51,541 --> 00:59:53,791
Yoko, thank god, you're okay!

848
00:59:53,875 --> 00:59:55,166
Wait, mommy!

849
00:59:56,875 --> 00:59:57,666
Look!

850
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:58,666
Here's your thank you present.

851
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:00,458
-You know,
for my birthday party!

852
01:00:00,541 --> 01:00:01,958
Huh?

853
01:00:02,041 --> 01:00:03,208
It's a beaded ring!

854
01:00:03,291 --> 01:00:05,875
I worked real hard
and made it all by myself!

855
01:00:05,958 --> 01:00:09,375
And I wanted to give it to
you as soon as could, mommy.

856
01:00:09,458 --> 01:00:10,666
I see.

857
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:12,125
Thank you, hon.

858
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:23,208
Something wrong?

859
01:00:27,208 --> 01:00:27,666
Don't...

860
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:29,083
be scared!

861
01:00:33,958 --> 01:00:35,625
Sweetheart...!

862
01:00:52,666 --> 01:00:54,250
Naomi.

863
01:01:00,458 --> 01:01:01,708
What...?!

864
01:01:05,166 --> 01:01:06,708
Naomi, hurry up!

865
01:01:08,791 --> 01:01:10,291
Go without me, Ross.

866
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:11,750
I'll hold them off
while you get away!

867
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:13,333
Naomi!

868
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:20,791
God dammit!

869
01:02:20,875 --> 01:02:21,708
That know-it-all prick!

870
01:02:21,791 --> 01:02:23,291
How could he do this to me?!

871
01:02:23,375 --> 01:02:25,750
I think it's inhuman,
and I'm a robot!

872
01:02:28,041 --> 01:02:28,875
 Oh, great!

873
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:30,750
Here we go again!

874
01:02:56,083 --> 01:02:57,166
Let's see...

875
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,041
Well, the best we can do
is give it a try!

876
01:04:00,083 --> 01:04:01,500
The elevator seems
to stop on this floor

877
01:04:01,583 --> 01:04:03,208
and not go any higher.

878
01:04:04,166 --> 01:04:05,208
Dammit!

879
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:07,291
How do we ride up from here?!

880
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:08,083
Papa!

881
01:04:08,166 --> 01:04:08,958
This way!

882
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:10,125
Huh?

883
01:04:10,958 --> 01:04:11,791
This way, c'mon!

884
01:04:11,875 --> 01:04:12,666
We can go up through here!

885
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:13,375
Yoko!

886
01:04:13,458 --> 01:04:15,291
Don't go running off!

887
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:19,250
But, we can go up this way!

888
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:20,541
How d'you know?

889
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:22,250
It's a secret.

890
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:24,125
You have to trust me.

891
01:04:27,666 --> 01:04:30,208
Well, I guess I'll just
have to trust you.

892
01:04:52,125 --> 01:04:54,125
There's someone
behind us, daddy.

893
01:05:02,041 --> 01:05:03,333
Papa!

894
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,083
No!

895
01:05:57,416 --> 01:05:58,458
What's wrong?

896
01:05:58,541 --> 01:06:00,500
We're not there yet, Armitage.

897
01:06:00,583 --> 01:06:03,000
Yoko's in danger!

898
01:06:03,083 --> 01:06:04,375
I want you
to do something, Mouse.

899
01:06:04,458 --> 01:06:06,250
-Release my
combat mode limiter.

900
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:08,125
Are you crazy?!

901
01:06:08,208 --> 01:06:10,416
Do you have even the tiniest
inkling what would happen

902
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,500
to your body if you
initiate your combat mode

903
01:06:12,583 --> 01:06:14,083
without the limiter?!

904
01:06:14,166 --> 01:06:17,875
Your power level would be
mind blowing, but still...

905
01:06:17,958 --> 01:06:20,500
You'd exceed your internal
battery's output limits,

906
01:06:20,583 --> 01:06:22,708
and that Class L heat radiator
system buried inside of you

907
01:06:22,791 --> 01:06:24,791
wouldn't be able
to keep up with it!

908
01:06:24,875 --> 01:06:26,708
That lovely skin
you're always showing off

909
01:06:26,791 --> 01:06:28,583
would melt down
within a few minutes!

910
01:06:28,666 --> 01:06:30,333
In the end, your body
itself would completely

911
01:06:30,416 --> 01:06:31,625
lose all control!

912
01:06:31,708 --> 01:06:33,208
I'm aware of that!

913
01:06:33,291 --> 01:06:34,375
Please help me, Mouse!

914
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:36,791
-There's no time left!

915
01:06:36,875 --> 01:06:37,958
Sheesh!

916
01:06:38,041 --> 01:06:40,916
I take no responsibility
for what happens!

917
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:44,083
Are we clear on this?

918
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,791
The password to
release your limiter...

919
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:47,500
is "Heaven's Door."

920
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:49,375
Knock once, and it opens.

921
01:06:49,458 --> 01:06:51,250
But, if you push things too far,

922
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:53,958
you'll end up knocking at
the Pearly Gates for real.

923
01:06:55,916 --> 01:06:57,958
On that note, let's go!

924
01:07:16,125 --> 01:07:17,291
Daddy!

925
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:17,750
Daddy!

926
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:18,750
That way!

927
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:19,958
Okay!

928
01:07:41,666 --> 01:07:43,791
Yoko...

929
01:07:43,875 --> 01:07:45,041
Did you...

930
01:07:45,125 --> 01:07:45,916
by any chance memorize
the entire floor plan?

931
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,125
Yeah.

932
01:07:47,208 --> 01:07:48,625
But, how?

933
01:07:48,708 --> 01:07:53,333
I just looked at it.
I can draw it for you.

934
01:07:58,375 --> 01:07:59,666
Well...!

935
01:08:02,416 --> 01:08:04,125
Hey, wow, whadaya know.

936
01:08:04,208 --> 01:08:06,125
You're quite a genius,
aren't you?

937
01:08:21,291 --> 01:08:21,833
Shit!

938
01:08:21,916 --> 01:08:22,958
Them again!

939
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,500
--Get away!
--Yoko!

940
01:08:50,416 --> 01:08:51,541
No!

941
01:08:51,625 --> 01:08:53,000
Get away from me!

942
01:09:04,583 --> 01:09:05,875
Mommy...

943
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:31,458
Naomi!

944
01:09:31,541 --> 01:09:32,333
Get on!

945
01:09:37,291 --> 01:09:37,833
Hurry up!

946
01:09:37,916 --> 01:09:39,250
Right!

947
01:09:39,333 --> 01:09:40,416
Yoko!

948
01:10:05,791 --> 01:10:07,916
Man, this is
getting exciting, isn't it?

949
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,083
But the real show
is yet to begin!

950
01:10:10,166 --> 01:10:11,541
And you, my dear Demetrio...

951
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:13,333
are the star!

952
01:10:16,708 --> 01:10:18,666
I have one more
favor to ask of you.

953
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:19,208
What...?!

954
01:10:19,291 --> 01:10:21,083
Another one?!

955
01:10:21,166 --> 01:10:22,291
I would assume you made

956
01:10:22,375 --> 01:10:24,958
a back-up copy of my
memory data, correct?

957
01:10:25,041 --> 01:10:27,500
Well, there's something I'd
like you to do with it for me.

958
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:35,625
She's cunning as
a little mouse.

959
01:10:35,708 --> 01:10:36,625
Well!

960
01:10:36,708 --> 01:10:38,208
Mice of a feather
flock together.

961
01:10:38,291 --> 01:10:39,041
Okay, then!

962
01:10:39,125 --> 01:10:40,541
Here we go...!

963
01:10:40,625 --> 01:10:42,458
It's show ti-i-i-me!

964
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:50,208
We interrupt this program
for a special report.

965
01:10:50,291 --> 01:10:54,125
We here at MGN have successfully
procured extraordinary footage

966
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:56,875
of the robot uprising which
has become better known

967
01:10:56,958 --> 01:10:59,291
as the First Error.

968
01:10:59,375 --> 01:11:01,666
As you can see from
this exclusive footage,

969
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:04,000
the energy plant where the
rebellion occurred was actually

970
01:11:04,083 --> 01:11:07,666
a front for illegal
Third Project research.

971
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:10,166
These shocking scenes
capture the project's failure

972
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:12,250
and the ERU's attempt
to suppress the truth

973
01:11:12,333 --> 01:11:14,208
fearing its disclosure.

974
01:11:14,291 --> 01:11:16,916
We have also received
information which deeply...

975
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,208
Why that goddamn rodent!

976
01:11:19,291 --> 01:11:21,291
How dare he try to ruin me?!

977
01:11:40,208 --> 01:11:41,500
Two against one!

978
01:11:41,583 --> 01:11:42,875
Then whadaya waiting for?!

979
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:45,541
Do whatever it takes
to finish them!

980
01:11:45,625 --> 01:11:46,916
None of them
must leave the Earth!

981
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,916
-Don't let
a single one survive!

982
01:12:28,541 --> 01:12:29,625
Oh shit!

983
01:12:33,166 --> 01:12:34,083
Yoko!

984
01:12:34,166 --> 01:12:35,375
Hang on tight!

985
01:13:11,375 --> 01:13:12,333
Naomi!

986
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:22,166
Get on my back!

987
01:13:25,958 --> 01:13:28,291
Hold on to me
as tight as you can!

988
01:14:42,125 --> 01:14:43,375
We're nearly there!

989
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:08,833
We're almost there, daddy!

990
01:15:08,916 --> 01:15:10,166
Huh?

991
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:24,583
Welcome to the No. 6
Chicago Orbital Elevator,

992
01:15:24,666 --> 01:15:26,791
your gateway to space!

993
01:15:36,083 --> 01:15:37,291
Naomi!

994
01:16:20,791 --> 01:16:22,208
There's the shuttle!

995
01:16:22,291 --> 01:16:23,666
C'mon, let's go!

996
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:28,500
Yoko.

997
01:16:32,083 --> 01:16:33,625
Yoko...

998
01:17:24,583 --> 01:17:25,708
Get back!

999
01:17:28,125 --> 01:17:29,250
Yoko!

1000
01:17:37,208 --> 01:17:38,166
Naomi!!

1001
01:17:48,625 --> 01:17:49,791
Naomi?

1002
01:17:53,416 --> 01:17:54,458
Goddamn you!

1003
01:18:05,833 --> 01:18:06,791
Yoko!

1004
01:18:10,583 --> 01:18:12,208
Let go of...

1005
01:18:12,291 --> 01:18:14,333
Let go of my daughter,
you bitch!

1006
01:18:15,708 --> 01:18:17,083
Mommy!

1007
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:25,541
Mommy!

1008
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:28,583
No!

1009
01:19:10,541 --> 01:19:12,333
Mommy...!

1010
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:16,250
Heaven's...

1011
01:19:16,333 --> 01:19:17,541
...Door!!

1012
01:19:58,125 --> 01:20:00,333
Talk about
your simple programs!

1013
01:20:00,416 --> 01:20:03,208
"Pursue targets
and destroy them," huh?

1014
01:20:29,541 --> 01:20:30,250
Reached my...

1015
01:20:30,333 --> 01:20:32,250
limit.

1016
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:39,791
Still alive?!

1017
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,750
Dammit!

1018
01:20:43,833 --> 01:20:44,666
There's no way...

1019
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:46,500
that I'll be beaten by you!

1020
01:20:51,375 --> 01:20:52,416
Mama...!

1021
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:55,458
Mama...!

1022
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:57,916
Please!

1023
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,125
Stop it!

1024
01:20:59,208 --> 01:21:02,583
You're hurt so bad,
you have to stop now!

1025
01:21:02,666 --> 01:21:04,708
Or else you're gonna die!

1026
01:21:27,333 --> 01:21:29,500
Go on, get the hell
back to your master...!!

1027
01:21:48,416 --> 01:21:50,083
Mommy!

1028
01:21:52,625 --> 01:21:54,125
I broke your...

1029
01:21:54,208 --> 01:21:55,625
I broke your ring.

1030
01:21:55,708 --> 01:21:57,625
Sorry.

1031
01:22:00,041 --> 01:22:01,541
Then I'll...

1032
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:03,500
make a whole bunch more for you,
mama, I'll make a ton of 'em!

1033
01:22:03,583 --> 01:22:04,750
'Kay?

1034
01:22:06,333 --> 01:22:07,625
 Mm-hm.

1035
01:22:12,583 --> 01:22:14,208
 Mommy, you're squishing me!

1036
01:22:15,833 --> 01:22:17,125
Mom - my!

1037
01:22:27,083 --> 01:22:28,333
Come on.

1038
01:22:28,416 --> 01:22:29,958
Let's go home.

1039
01:22:44,416 --> 01:22:46,500
You think you're getting away?!

1040
01:22:46,583 --> 01:22:48,750
This vessel's unregistered!

1041
01:22:51,416 --> 01:22:53,375
License number verification!

1042
01:22:56,958 --> 01:22:58,125
Vessel confirmed.

1043
01:22:58,208 --> 01:23:00,208
Noncompliant license detected.

1044
01:23:00,291 --> 01:23:02,000
Security system engaged.

1045
01:23:02,083 --> 01:23:03,875
Do you wish to
clear it for take-off?

1046
01:23:03,958 --> 01:23:05,208
Like hell I will!

1047
01:23:05,291 --> 01:23:07,666
Transfer weapon
control to me now!

1048
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:10,375
That order requires a
double-A security authorization

1049
01:23:10,458 --> 01:23:11,583
or higher.

1050
01:23:11,666 --> 01:23:13,333
This is Demetrio Mardini!

1051
01:23:13,416 --> 01:23:15,083
The password is...

1052
01:23:16,416 --> 01:23:17,458
Verify!

1053
01:23:18,541 --> 01:23:19,708
Confirmed.

1054
01:23:19,791 --> 01:23:20,458
Warning!

1055
01:23:20,541 --> 01:23:21,833
Warning!

1056
01:23:21,916 --> 01:23:23,750
Departing unlicensed vessel
does not have clearance

1057
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:25,250
to leave port!

1058
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:28,500
If this warning is ignored,
use of force is authorized!

1059
01:23:32,333 --> 01:23:34,000
Now you're going to see-uh!

1060
01:23:34,083 --> 01:23:34,541
Hn?!

1061
01:23:35,833 --> 01:23:37,250
 It's you!

1062
01:23:43,375 --> 01:23:46,083
Wh- why'd you
come back here, what for?

1063
01:23:46,166 --> 01:23:48,333
Confirm weapons
are ready to fire.

1064
01:23:48,416 --> 01:23:49,291
Oh!

1065
01:23:57,708 --> 01:23:59,791
Why kill me?

1066
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:03,750
I told you.

1067
01:24:03,833 --> 01:24:06,583
I said if you harmed a hair on
my daughter, I would kill you.

1068
01:24:06,666 --> 01:24:08,250
It can't be!

1069
01:24:08,333 --> 01:24:10,291
You're Armitage?!

1070
01:24:37,208 --> 01:24:38,958
Please initiate firing mode.

1071
01:24:39,958 --> 01:24:41,958
Please initiate firing mode.

1072
01:24:54,708 --> 01:24:56,166
So long.

1073
01:25:04,291 --> 01:25:06,416
It was announced today that the
government would proceed with

1074
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:10,166
the development of the
Zephoria terra forming project.

1075
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:13,000
Although planned some time ago,
this venture has been on hold

1076
01:25:13,083 --> 01:25:16,291
due to numerous points
of contention until now.

1077
01:25:16,375 --> 01:25:18,375
The project involves the
collection of ice chunks

1078
01:25:18,458 --> 01:25:21,583
floating in high orbit around
Mars which will be dropped onto

1079
01:25:21,666 --> 01:25:25,000
the Martian equator in order
to form an artificial ocean.

1080
01:25:44,458 --> 01:25:45,833
Can't catch me!

1081
01:25:51,041 --> 01:25:52,291
Mommy!

1082
01:26:04,041 --> 01:26:06,250
Daddy, your face is stubbly!

1083
01:30:05,208 --> 01:30:06,708
Jesus Christ.

1084
01:30:06,791 --> 01:30:08,500
Between picking you up
from that blast site

1085
01:30:08,583 --> 01:30:10,875
and then fixing you up
as much as I have,

1086
01:30:10,958 --> 01:30:15,166
I've gone through a lot
of trouble, you know that?

1087
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:17,208
Are you awake now,

1088
01:30:17,291 --> 01:30:19,083
my honey?

1089
01:30:19,166 --> 01:30:20,083
Yes.

1090
01:30:20,166 --> 01:30:21,833
Good morning, master.
