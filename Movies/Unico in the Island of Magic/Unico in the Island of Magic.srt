Poor innocent creature.

10
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:40,285
As the Westwind, the gods have
ordered me to abandon you

11
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,705
on the hill of oblivion,
but I cannot do it.

12
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,376
Instead I will leave you
here, Unico

13
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,837
and pray that the gods
don't find you.

14
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,342
Once again you are all alone.

15
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,347
You will remember nothing
of what has happened.

Goodbye Unico.

Is anybody here?

20
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,495
There's got to be somebody.

[shouts] Hey!
Can anybody hear me--

[Melvin shouts] Hey! Put a lid
on it! I'm trying to sleep.

Yippee, there's somebody here!

Hey! Where are you? [gasps]

00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:47,560
Hehe, oh, there you are.
Who are you?

28
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,771
What do you mean, who am I?

29
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:53,316
Where have you been?
Mars or something?

30
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:58,613
I am Melvin Manificat,
and this is my forest.

00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,907
Oh, Melvin Manificat.

32
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,118
That certainly is
an attractive coat you have.

33
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,745
[grunts] You better believe it.

34
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,538
It strikes terror
into the hearts

35
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,333
of anyone that sees it.
Ow! [groans]

36
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,459
Oh, are you alright?

37
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,003
Oh, shut up!

38
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,512
[Melvin] Where you from Peewee?

39
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,472
[Unico] I don't know.

40
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,768
Where you headed?

41
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,562
I don't know.

42
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,901
I never met anybody before
who didn't know where

43
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,112
he came from,
or where he's headed to.

44
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,281

What in the world are you?

46
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,536
I'm Unico.

47
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,830
Well, what sort
of a name is that?

48
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,373
What sort of a thing are you?

49
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,084
I'm Unico, that's all,
just Unico.

50
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:57,005
Yeah, yeah, but what
exactly is a unico? [sobbing]

51
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,924
Maybe you're some kind of sheep?
[sighs]

52
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,676
Oh.

53
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,012
[Unico] No, I don't think
I'm any kind of sheep.

54
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:08,808
Ooh, well, I ain't never seen
nothing like you before.

55
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,560
I don't like your looks.

56
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,104
Oh wait, what are you doing?

57
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:16,441
-I'm Unico, that's all I know.
-[screams] Stay away from me!

58
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,444
-Get back!
-I'm not going to do anything.

59
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,820
That's what you say.

60
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,990
What's that horn
doing on your head?

61
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,284
Oh, oh, oh.
[electronic squeak]

62
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,246
You're just waiting to stick me
with it as soon as my back

63
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,498
-is turned.
I wouldn't do anything

64
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,835
-like that--
-Yeah! Stay away from me. Oh!

65
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,965
[gasping] Go ahead, kill me,
I'm all yours, get it over with.

66
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,884
[sobs] I'm so young.

67
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,719
I have my whole life
ahead of me.

68
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,847
-[sobbing continues]
-Now then,

69
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,808
-Huh?
-Take a good look at that guy

70
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,477
-you're so scared of.
-What?

71
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,898
You know, when you start falling
like a baby in front of a midget

72
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:00,318
like that, we begin to wonder
whether you should be the boss

73
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,070
of this forest anymore.

74
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,654
[stutters] But his horn?

75
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,782
Eh, it's the size
of a toothpick,

76
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,492
it couldn't harm a flea.

77
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,619
[gasps] Oh-uh.

78
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,412
Watch out! [groans]

79
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,833
-What's the big idea?
-Hm?

80
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,211
Thought you could pull
a fast one on me, did ya?

81
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,714
-Hm? Mm.
-[gasping] Oh, oh.

82
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,176
Ha-ha, you're not so tough
after all, are you?

83
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,679
I'll teach you to make a fool
outta Melvin Manificat.

84
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:33,267
-[gasps] Ow, ow.
-[screams] I'm gonna kill you!

85
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:40,108
I'm gonna turn that horn
of yours into mandolin picks.

86
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,403
Stop right where you are Peewee!

00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,238
-I won't.
-[screaming continues]

Okay, that does it,
now you made me mad.

[gasps and screams]

91
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,211
If he knows what's good for him,
he'll clear out of my forest,

92
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,588
-and pronto. Come on.
-You handled that real good.

93
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,632
Well, that's what a boss
is for after all.

out of his forest.

But I don't' know
which way is out.

at least let me explain to ya.

162
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,992
What you got here is your
most advanced stereophonic

163
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,953
sound system in the world.

164
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,288
In this box,
you got your tweeter,

165
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,582
and here's your woofer see?

166
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,835
First the tweeter,
[singing]

167
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,297
then the woofer.
[low croaks]

168
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,301
Ain't that the cat's pajamas,
hm-mm?

169
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,179
When you put 'em on,
you just can't stop your feet

170
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,681
from dancing, you see?

171
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,099
[sings beats]

172
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,691
I tell ya, it's the living end,
and I'll give it to you

173
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:22,069
as a present if you only
promise not to zap me, huh?

174
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:27,116
No wait! Okay, okay,
that was a stupid idea,

175
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,952
but listen, I'll serve you,
I'll be your slave,

176
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,246
I'll do anything you say,
really I will, really.

177
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,665
Perhaps you could
be of use to me.

178
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,834
He he, sure, sure, he he.

179
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,837
So be it, you shall serve me.

180
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,005
[electronic zap]

181
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,591
I must turn all the animals
of the forest

182
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,717
into living puppets.

183
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,594
What do you mean puppets?

184
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,264
Just that. I turn them
into living puppets.

185
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,851
But why would you want
to do something like that, huh?

186
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,185
That's no concern of yours.

187
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,230
Your job is to help me
locate the animals.

188
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:01,317
Okay, okay,
it's your party, pal.

189
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,445
Let's see, what have
we got here?

190
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:07,323
Oh, look over there, a squirrel.
[loud zap]

191
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,784
[gasps]
[zappings]

192
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,579
They're quick, aren't they?

193
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,291
[grunts] A couple of rabbits
over there.

194
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,378
Hmm.

195
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,672
These creatures are too small.

196
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,716
You must find me
something bigger.

197
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,887
It would help if you could
shoot straight. [gasps]

198
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,683
[chuckles] I got ya.

199
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,478
Back there, just what
you're looking for, ha.

200
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,022
Whoa!

201
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,609
[groaning]

202
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,866
-Mm, what's this, I've never
-[screams]

203
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,701
-seen anything like it.
-[gasps]

204
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,537
And what sort of animal are you?

205
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,957
Come on, come on,
turn him into a puppet.

206
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,416
This I gotta see.

207
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,085
-[screaming]
-I think the master will be

208
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,878
pleased with this one.

209
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,714
-Whoa!
-[screaming continues]

210
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,466
[zapping]

211
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,304
There he goes, there.
Quick, shoot him, shoot him!

212
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,555
Come on.

213
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:19,311
Whoa! Whoa! Watch out,
watch out, watch out!

214
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,271
-Be quiet.
-[muffled screams]

215
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,657
I told you to watch out.

216
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,953
-Why didn't you listen to me?
-Oh, shut up!

217
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,164
That's just great.

218
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,002
I tried to save your neck
and you tell me to shut up.

219
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,379
I don't like this relationship.

220
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,172
-Listen, you little--
-Okay, okay.

221
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,217
[running water]
[gentle music]

222
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,107
[music continues]

223
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,375
-[Melvin] Er, say boss?
-You may call me Toby.

224
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,461
-Toby?
-That is my name.

225
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,423
Well, Toby, once the animals
have been turned into living

226
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,216
puppets, what's next?

227
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,926
That is not for you to know.

228
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,430
Ah, come on, I'm your pal,
you can tell me.

229
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,975
-Can't you give me a hint?
-Shh.

230
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:43,937
Be quiet, you fool,
the master is approaching.

231
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:46,774
[Karuku] Toby.

232
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,235
Toby.

233
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,363
[yells] Toby.

234
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,950
-[trembling]
-I'm here, Lord Karuku.

235
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,952
Your wish is my command.

236
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:06,251
I hope you have not
been lazy, Toby.

237
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,294
No Master.

238
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,422
Is the ship ready for departure?

239
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,632
Yes Master.

240
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:15,636
And its cargo of living puppets?
Are they ready as well?

241
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:20,015
[stutters] It has proven more
difficult to catch the animals

242
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,600
than I had hoped, Master.

243
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:25,395
[scoffs] I am not
interested in excuses, Toby.

244
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,982
I'm sorry, Lord Karuku.

245
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:34,238
Well, you will just have
to work harder, won't you?

246
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:38,826
Because I simply have to have
my living puppets, don't I?

247
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:42,454
-Yes Master.
-Oh yes, Toby,

248
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,083
once you're finished
with all the animals,

249
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:50,796
you may begin collecting... people.

250
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,841
Collecting people?

251
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,760
I believe that's what I said.

252
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,429
They are such stupid things,

253
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:04,059
that I am sure they'll be even
easier for you to deal with

254
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,269
than the animals.

255
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:09,398
You may begin with those houses
down in the valley there.

256
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,484
You'd do that for me, won't you?

257
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:18,115
-Toby?
-I will of course, Master.

258
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,576
And in return you will teach
me more of your magic?

259
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:25,455
Hurry up and bring the living
puppets to my island.

260
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:29,168
And if I am pleased, I suppose
I might teach you another

261
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,045
-magic trick.
-[Toby] Master.

262
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,132
And be quick about it too, Toby.

263
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,925
Yes, Lord Karuku.

264
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,428
[electronic whizzing]

265
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,058
[stuttering] What was that?

266
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:46,768
A magician.

267
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,687
And my master.

268
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,232
That's some trick appearing
and disappearing like that.

269
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,195
Did he say he wanted
you to start turning people

270
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,907
into living puppets? Ha,
that's my idea of a good time.

271
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,160
I never liked people,
can't stand 'em, come on,

272
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:08,207
zap 'em. Oh boy, I can't
wait to see this, ha.

273
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:12,461
Be quiet, unless you want
to be the very first to undergo

274
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:15,297
-the transformation.
-[trembling sighs]

275
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,841
This wasn't part of the bargain.

276
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,054
[Melvin] Say, are you really
gonna zap every one

277
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,348
of the people down there?
Every one? [cries]

278
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,266
-I said be quiet.
-Sorry.

279
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,614
[Sherry] Huh, he's awake.

280
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,574
It's amazing he's still alive

281
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,534
after all that he's
been through.

282
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,453
[giggles] Isn't he cute?

283
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,456
Are you alright? Huh?

284
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,584
It looks like somebody
ruffed the little fellow up.

285
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,586
Here you go, drink some milk.

286
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,423
[father] I can't say I've ever
seen anything quite like him.

287
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,052
Here, you gotta have
some of this milk.

288
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,137
That way you'll get
your strength back.

289
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,389
Come on.

290
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:09,101
Here, watch me and I'll show
you how to do it, alright?

291
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,438
[scoffs] He's probably
frightened of people.

292
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,482
Well, I'll take care of that.

293
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,193
You see that man at the table
smoking a pipe?

294
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,945
That man is my father.

295
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:23,365
And that woman with her hands
in the suds is my mother.

296
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,575
Is it working?

297
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,912
[sighs] There you go.

298
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:34,334
There used to be another
person here, my older brother.

299
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,919
But he went away.

300
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,547
That was almost
three years ago now.

301
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,718
I wonder where he is,
what he's doing.

302
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,012
It's time we forgot about him.

303
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:49,766
Enough! I'm certain he's
forgotten all about us by now.

304
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,604
I have an early day,
I'm turning in.

305
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,778
-Goodnight, Father.
-[sighs]

306
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:04,740
[Mother] Goodnight.

307
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:15,667
Why do I make Father angry
whenever I mention my brother?

308
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,921
Your father's not angry
with you, dear.

309
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,175
When a man is worried
by something inside him,

310
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,761
and he's too proud
to weep or cry out,

311
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,805
he sometimes gets angry
at those around him.

312
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:33,268
But he's not angry with you,
not with you.

313
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,898
Poor little fellow, you look
like you haven't a friend

314
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:38,982
in the world.

315
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,151
Me too.

316
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,154
I lost my best friend
when I lost my brother.

317
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,949
Don't be frightened.

318
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,787
From now on, we can be
each other's best friend.

319
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,747
Isn't that right, Mother?

320
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,582
[Mother] That's right, Sherry.

321
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,960
So, let's have
a little milk now.

322
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,297
Come on, what's wrong with you?

323
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,257
You've got to drink some.

324
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,427
Sherry, don't threaten him,
you're just frightening him

325
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,637
all the more.

326
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,473
[giggles] Sorry.

327
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,434
He'll be better in the morning.

328
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,896
Come along, it's time for bed.

329
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,815
-Mother?
-Yes Dear?

330
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,067
May I stay up with him
a little longer?

331
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:26,029
-Alright, don't be too long.
-I won't. Goodnight.

332
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,451
I like you, you know.

333
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,664
I like all animals.

334
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:40,794
Birds and rabbits,
and squirrels and everything.

335
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:45,215
And I like... my brother.

336
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,509
I like him a lot.

337
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,640
I'm... Unico.

338
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,444
[birds tweeting]

339
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,911
[Sherry] I like all animals.

340
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,414
Birds and rabbits,
and everything.

341
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,917
And I like you too.
[sighs]

342
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,546
[gentle sigh]

343
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,139
[gasps] So you're not afraid
of me anymore, are you?

344
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,517
-I'm Unico.
-[gasps] Unico?

345
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:42,105
[Sherry yells] Mother? Father?
The little one is all better.

346
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:45,358
Come on, I'll race
you to the bridge.

347
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,612
-Faster, Unico. Faster. [laughs]
-[giggling]

348
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,363
Come on!

349
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:54,451
Here, we're friends now, we
must swear eternal friendship,

350
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,245
so no matter what happens
we'll stand by each other.

351
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:58,580
Let's shake hands.

352
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,041
-Come on!
-Okay.

353
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,629
-[Unico giggling] Wait for me.
-Come on.

354
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,508
-[Unico] Where are you?
-I'm over here.

355
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,927
There you are.

356
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:18,892
[thunder]

357
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,857
Sherry? Come on
into the house now.

358
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,692
It looks like it's
going to rain.

359
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,110
Come on now.

360
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:31,738
[lightening cracks]

361
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,533
[trembling]

362
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,497
Don't worry, there's nothing
to be frightened of.

363
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,791
I thought you were
a brave little fella.

364
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:46,795
Just repeat, \"I'm not scared,\"
three times and you'll be fine.

365
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,507
[loud gasp] I guess
it is a little scary.

366
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:52,842
-Hm?
-Huh?

367
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,177
[creaking]

368
00:25:58,974 --> 00:25:59,975
[wind howls]

369
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:04,896
Ja, ja. [laughs]

370
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,317
What is it you want?

371
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:17,367
It's my big brother,
he's come home.

372
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:22,330
-[stutters] Toby, is that you?
-Oh, yes, it is you!

373
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,416
You've come home at last.

374
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,626
[Sherry] So where have
you been all this time?

375
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,796
-We were so worried about you.
-[Mother] Oh, Toby.

376
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:33,049
But my boy, what on earth
is that you've got on?

377
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,885
It looks like
a magician's costume, Toby?

378
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,471
That's exactly
what it is, Mother.

379
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,599
Hm?
[electronic beeps]

380
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,727
-[gasps]
-Huh?

381
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:50,317
Oh no, that terrible man
is Sherry's lost brother.

382
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,653
[sniffing]
[fire crackling]

383
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,532
This smells kind of familiar.

384
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,783
Hm.

385
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,704
[Toby] Sherry,
I've brought you a gift.

386
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:07,876
[sniffing continues]

387
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:10,670
Hm.

388
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,465
-Hm, hm.
-Oh.

389
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,469
Watch closely now.

390
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,684
Isn't it the loveliest doll
you've ever seen?

391
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:29,606
-Take it, it's yours?
-I can't, I'm afraid of it.

392
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:34,194
And after I went to all
the trouble of making for you.

393
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:35,779
[scoffs]

394
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,326
[scoffs]

395
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:46,164
-Toby, what have you become?
-What you see, Father.

396
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:49,668
I can do anything.
[electronic tinkling]

397
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,503
Hm?

398
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,548
Toby, stop it,
leave your father alone.

399
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,138
-I don't like this, my boy.
-From this moment on,

400
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:05,141
you will wear nothing but
the finest dresses, Mother.

401
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,894
[electronic zapping]
[loud gasp]

402
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:14,651
I don't want them, I don't
want them, leave me alone!

403
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,194
What are you trying
to do, Toby?

404
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,362
I can do anything.

405
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,030
Anything at all.

406
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,993
I have been given the power
to make you all happy

407
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,328
for the rest of your lives.

408
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:29,582
Father, that old pipe is your
prized possession, isn't it?

409
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,711
Well, I can turn
that pipe into gold.

410
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:33,837
Stop it!

411
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:37,382
These powers of yours, they're,
they're not right, Toby.

412
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:41,302
You can't find real happiness
by waving your hand,

413
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,096
and casting a magic spell.

414
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:47,726
[sighs] I should've know
you'd say something like that.

415
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,520
You haven't changed
a bit, Father.

416
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,689
Hm, oh.

417
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,277
Ah-ha! I knew it had to be you!
I knew it.

418
00:28:57,277 --> 00:29:00,655
I knew it all the time.
Now I got you! [laughs]

419
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,240
Shh.

420
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,492
Hm?

421
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,244
[Toby blows]

422
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:14,294
[Karuku] Toby? Toby?

423
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,838
Mother, Father, Sherry!
You've got to hide.

424
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,173
Get out of here!

425
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,341
Ridiculous! This is our home,

426
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,469
what on earth should
we hide from?

427
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,430
-There's no time to explain--
-[Karuku] Toby?

428
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,349
-[gasping]
-Toby.

429
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:34,731
Toby, you're not being
lazy again, are you?

430
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,526
Toby! Toby!

431
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:44,324
My, my, Toby, imagine finding
you in a place like this?

432
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:49,204
Oh, those are people,
aren't they, Toby?

433
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:52,207
No, Lord Karuku,
these people are useless.

434
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:55,168
Oh Toby, you do
them a disservice,

435
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,670
I think they will make
delightful puppets.

436
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,714
[both groaning]

437
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,801
[thuds]

438
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,307
Now, are there any other
people in this house, Toby?

439
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,433
Er, none.

440
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:15,104
Well then, hurry up and do
to the rest of the village

441
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,982
what I just did
to this charming couple.

442
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:21,653
You won't keep me waiting,
will you, Toby?

443
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:24,614
[loud whizzing]

444
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,913
[high pitch zap]

445
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,504
[Sherry] Toby! Where are you?

446
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:42,423
Sherry, go and hide
yourself in the forest.

447
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,218
If you don't hide,
your brother-- [loud zap]

448
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:48,137
will have to turn you
into a living puppet.

449
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:53,476
[cries] Why are you doing to us?
Please, Toby, change Mother

450
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,145
and Father back again.
Change them back.

451
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:00,066
I'm sorry, Sherry, but I can't.
I don't know how.

452
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,026
Only Lord Kuruku
has the power

453
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,695
to change our mother
and father back.

454
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,406
I can only follow
my master's orders.

455
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:10,535
and so I must turn
all the villagers,

456
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:13,162
people of my own kind
into living puppets!

457
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:16,374
And in return
my master teaches me

458
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,501
another little
bit of his magic.

459
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:20,962
But some day Cheri,

460
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,339
when I'm the greatest
magician in the world

461
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:28,011
I will find the way
to repay you. I swear it!

462
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,556
[turbulent music]

463
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,637
[music ends]

464
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,810
[casual music]

465
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,310
[Cheri gasps and moans]

466
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,899
[gasps and moans]

467
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,117
Father! Mother!

468
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,244
They both going away somewhere.

469
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,747
They're all going away.

470
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,554
[music crescendo]

471
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,398
[Cheri panting]

472
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,610
I can't tell which is father
and mother anymore.

473
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,862
They're all going down
to the harbor.

474
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,655
I wonder why.

475
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,033
[Cheri] Let's follow them
and find out.

476
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,242
[Unico] All right.

00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,028
Wait for me!

480
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,165
We've gotta get on that ship
with my parents.

481
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,710
[Unico] I wonder
where they taking everybody.

482
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:31,963
Nightmare Island.

483
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,756
[Yamaneko] Nightmare Island,
huh?

484
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,592
I heard bad things
about that place.

[Cheri and Unico gasp]

488
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,944
Why is your boss wanna
carry all these things

489
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,238
to Nightmare Island for? Huh?

490
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,075
You'll find out
when we get there.

491
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,261
I wonder
where this ship is going.

492
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,306
I don't know but I hope
it gets there soon.

493
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,392
-[Unico] Whoa!
-[Cheri gasps]

494
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,477
Is Nightmare Island far?

495
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,022
No, not far at all.

496
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,815
You can see it already.

-I'm coming!

503
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:03,823
Wow, I never seen anything
like this place.

504
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:09,662
[Yamaneko] Huh? What?

505
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,498
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

506
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,294
We've got to try
and find Lord Kuruku.

507
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,421
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

[Yamaneko]

509
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,428
Where they go?

However did you
find your way in?

537
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,694
[Unico] Lord Kuruku!

538
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,155
Please, sir, I beg of you!

539
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,074
You beg of me?

540
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,702
Are you volunteering
to become living puppets?

541
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,704
That's very charitable of you.

542
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,540
Oh, you know
that's not what I mean.

543
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:20,251
Turning people
into puppets is a wicked thing!

544
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,961
You're a bad man!

545
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,463
[Kuruku laughing]

546
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,718
We'll aside from that,

547
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:33,097
am I the sort of person you
like to expend time with, huh?

548
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,182
Lord Kuruku you've got

549
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,351
to return my mother
and my father!

550
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,104
You're wasting your
time little girl

551
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,481
and what's worse
you're wasting mine.

552
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:46,735
Toby! Toby, come to me!

553
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:49,905
I'm here master.

554
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,868
I want you to deal
with these annoying pair

555

of little trespassers Toby.

556

- Huh? Cheri!
-Toby!

557
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,835
I beg a favor of you
Lord Kuruku.

558
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:06,881
My! This is a big day
for begging favors.

559
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,717
-What it is?
-They're only children master.

560
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:12,845
Please don't force me to turn
them into living puppets.

561
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,806
Well then,
what is that you propose?

562
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,850
As they're only children

563
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,603
let me turn them
into toys master.

564
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,440
Fine, fine, just get rid
of the little brats.

565
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:25,900
Thank you master.

00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,622
Cheri, why didn't you listen

569
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,332
when I told you to hide
in the forest?

570
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:44,335
This is the weirdest
looking toy I ever saw.

571

[monster rattles]

572
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,802
Forgive me Cheri.

573
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,014
But you see,
I know the magic for toys.

574
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,432
Soon I'll change back

575
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:00,351
and carry you away
from this island.

576
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,229
[Yamaneko] Yeah, but doesn't
mean you have to do it

577
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,730
for this little run too.

All right my little toys,

582
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,086
I'm in the mood to be amused.

[Kuruku laughing]
Better and better!

601

No Toby, stop! You have to save

What about our mother
and father?

[Unico] He's gone.

Where is
this Valley of the Demons?

Oh, no!

He's going there to turn
all them into living puppets.

-Come on, Unico.
-Where to?

627

We've got to go there too.

The Valley of the Demons?

629
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:20,838
We have to stop Toby.

630
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,589
We have to warn the demons

631

into living puppets.

[Cheri panting]

640
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,278
-Hello! Is anybody home?
-Hello!

641
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:27,863
It's so quiet.

642
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:29,573
[sighs] Hello?

643
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:35,203
[Cheri and Unico screaming]

644
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,084
[Unico] Oh!
Who turned out the light?

645
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,794
[Cheri] Unico, where are you?

646
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:44,338

-What's wrong, Unico?

648
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,633
[Unico grunts] Be
quiet for a minute,

649
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:49,176
I'm trying to light up.

650
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:50,761
[Cheri gasps]

651
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,764
I can't believe it!

00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:57,851
-[Unico struggling grunts]
-[Cheri gasps]

653
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,811
That's wonderful, Unico!

654
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:03,023
I had no idea you could do
anything like that.

655
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,735
[struggling grunts] I have
to work at it or it goes out.

656
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:09,321
[Cheri] Is anybody here?

657
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,742
It looks like they've all gone.

658
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,370
Toby must've turned
them into puppets

659
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:17,621
and taken them away.

660
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,540
[crying in the distance]

661
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,626
Listen!

662
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,462
-What? What is it?
-[Unico hushes]

663
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,172
-I hear something.
-[crying in the distance]

664
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:30,842
It's over there!

665
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:33,720
What do you think it could be?

666
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,600
[Unico] It sounds like crying.

667
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,560
But who could be crying.

668
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,854
[crying in the distance]

669
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:44,940
[Cheri] Hello! Who's there?

670
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:47,109
[Unico] Oh! Here they are.

671
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,195
[Cheri] Those are baby demons.

672
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,991
So he wasn't able
to find you, huh?

673
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:56,243
What happen to your parents?

674
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,663
[all crying and moaning]

675
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:03,625
He took all the mothers
and fathers away.

676
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:09,047
We all hid down
here in this hole

677
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:10,799
and now we are alone.

678
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,093
[all moaning]

679
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:15,637
It was my brother
who did this to you.

680
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:18,557
Oh, forgive me! [crying]

681
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,351
[all sobbing and screaming]

682
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,661
Stop it everyone!

683
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:43,915
Oh! When you cry
like that it makes me--

684
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:46,668
[moaning and sobbing]

685
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,130
[Unico] Oh!

686
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,427
[yawns]

687
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:08,065
Oh, please stop it!

688
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,109
Stop crying, oh!

689
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,071
I'm so sorry!

690
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,782
I promise I'll bring
your parents back to you.

691
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,618
Wherever they are,
I'll bring them back.

692
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,745
I promise.

693
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,247
How are you going to do that?

694
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:27,751
We have no idea
how to fight Kuruku’s magic.

695
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:31,630
There must be someone,
somewhere who would know.

696
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:35,634
The Sphinx who knows everything
would probably know that too.

697
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,594
The what that knows everything?

698
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:39,888
Of course she'd know!

699
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:41,389
Hey listen,

700
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:44,434
if anybody know how to fight
his magic the Sphinx would.

701
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,562
Well then,
where's exactly is the Sphinx

702
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:48,980
who knows everything?

703

-[demon 1 grunts]
-[Unico] Hey!

704
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,360
Stop it! Let me go.

00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:54,611
[demon 1 grunts]

706
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:57,280
-This is serious business you--
-[demon 1 grunts]

707
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:00,367
Oh! Cut it up!
What's wrong with you?

708
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:03,662
Cheri, we've got
to find this Sphinx,

709
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:06,164
she's the only chance
that we've got.

710
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:08,834
She's over there.

711
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,502
You don't have far to go!

712
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,796
We'll go and see the Sphinx

713
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:16,341
and I promise we'll bring
your parents back to you.

714
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:18,051
Don't worry!

715
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:20,971
[Unico] We'll be back soon.

716
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,682
So be brave!

717
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:27,185
And don't cry!

718
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:33,108
Mama! Mama!

[wind blowing]

722
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,470
Unico, forgive me.

723
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:06,141
I know I should never have
to drag you into all this.

724
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:09,936
[sighs] Where do you think
the Sphinx could be?

725
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,733
[Cheri] How could anyone
live in a place like this?

726
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:15,775
[Unico grunts]

727
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,154
Come on, Cheri.

728
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,740
You're right,
we have to find her.

729
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:25,410
For my mother and father sake.

730
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,954
But I'm so tired.

731
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:30,790
So tired.

[Unico moaning]

00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,884
I can't go...

735
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:45,513
-...much further.
-Who goes there?

736
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:48,683
Who dares trespass on my desert?

737
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:50,977
Go away!

738
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,521
Hey, answer me!

739
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,316
Are you two all right?

740
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:58,109

[emotional music]

742
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,866
I've never seen anything
like you.

743
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:05,909
What are you?

744
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:07,744
[Mars grunts]

745
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,497
[grunts] Huh!

746
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:13,375
I'm not so sure
you're even worth to saving.

747
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,001
[Mars sighs]

748
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:20,548
[grunting] This one
is more like it!

749
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:25,095
I'll be more than happy
to save your life. [laughing]

750
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:29,766
Hmm, so you came all this way

751
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,352
into the desert just
to see the Sphinx, huh?

752
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,729
Yes, we got to see her.

753
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,941
But she could be anywhere.
Can you help us?

754
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,860
You see,
the Sphinx is my mother.

755
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:44,656
But she's out visiting friends,
so I'm in charge.

756
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:47,575
Oh, so you mean
the Sphinx isn't even here?

757
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:50,704
And after we've come
all this way.

758
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,122
Don't look so depressed,

759
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:56,668
anything you wanna know
just ask me, I know everything!

760
00:54:57,752 --> 00:55:00,672
Do you know how to fight
Kuruku's magic powers?

761
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,465
Kuruku? What's that?

762
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,760
Anyway I'm not expected
to know about magic yet.

763
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:07,554
Ask me something simpler.

764
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,180
We’re in trouble Cheri.

765
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:10,890
[Cheri moans]

766
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:14,185
Oh, wait a minute!

767
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,146
I bet the great Trojan Horse

768
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:19,065
will be able to help
you fight this guy magic powers.

769
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:23,361
My mother said that he knows
almost as much she does.

770
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,280
The Trojan Horse?

771
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:29,617
You got it! The Trojan Horse
at the End of the Earth!

772
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:32,787
[blowing wind]

773
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,623
But listen, the End of the Earth

774
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:38,918
is a long, long,
long way from here.

775
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:42,714
But that's where you find him.

776
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,718
[Cheri] Could he really be
the one to tell me

777
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,720
how to get my mother
and father back?

778
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,680
But nobody is ever been able

779
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,182
to make it
to the End of the Earth.

780
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:55,185
Hey! Where do you think
you're going?

781
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:59,064
[grunts] I tell you,
you're crazy!

782
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:03,068
Hey, do you think you can just
walk to the End of the Earth?

783
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,862
They're nuts. Hey, stop!

784
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,784
[Mars sighs] Hey!

785
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:14,788
Come back! You'll never make it!

786
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:17,290
You can walk for years,
and years,

787
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:20,377
and years and still not
even get close to it.

788
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:23,338
[Cheri] That may be,
but I have to try.

789
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:26,007
-Unico!
-Yes, Cheri?

790
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:28,134
This is where we go
our separate ways.

791
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:31,930
[laughs] Our separate ways?
What do you mean?

792
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,473
Just what she said bone head.

793
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:37,227
Can't you see that the lady
is trying to tell you goodbye?

794
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:40,855
Goodbye? But is that mean
that she's leaving me here?

795
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:44,067
No! I won't stay here!

796
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:46,569
I'm coming with you
to the End of the Earth!

797
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:49,864
-Unico?
-[Unico] Hmm?

798
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:52,283
Thank you for coming
along with me this far

799
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:54,661
but now I'll have
to go all alone.

800
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,664
-I can't take you with me.
-Why not?

801
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:01,042
-[Cheri] Just because.
-[Unico] Because why?

802
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,085
Unico...

803
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,548
-Goodbye!
-Cheri!

804
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:10,385
-Stop following me,
-Cheri, what's wrong with you?

805
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:12,554
What's wrong?

806
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:15,515
She doesn't like me anymore.

807
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:16,891
-Oh yeah?
-That's right!

808
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,102
She's living me behind,
isn't she?

809
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:22,647
[Mars] Bone head, she not only
likes ya, she loves ya.

810
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:24,399
No she doesn't.

811
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:26,985
If she did,
she wouldn't go away and...

812
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:29,487
leave me here. She wouldn't.

813
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:33,491
Is because she loves you
that she's making you stay here.

814
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:36,202
She doesn't want you
to have to suffer too.

815
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:40,248
She's gonna find the End
of the World all by herself.

816
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:44,294
-She's really something else.
-[sighs] You're right!

817
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,254
Cheri!

818
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,383
Wait Cheri!

819
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:54,179
You do love me! You do!

820
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,806
And I love you!

821
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,309
I can help you Cheri!

822
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:01,394
I can!

823
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,605
[confidant music]

824
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,361
What? What's happen
to the little guy?

825
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,363
Hey slow down!

826
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:15,325
Is that or you'll fly right
right of the End of the Earth!

827
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:18,453
[Cheri stammers] I'm sorry,

828
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:20,413
I couldn't take
you with me Unico.

829
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:23,082
I'll miss you already.

830
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,543
Oh Unico, goodbye.

831
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,962
[Cheri gasps]

832
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:32,300
Who are you? Are you taking
me to the End of the Earth?

833
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:36,846
Hey wait a minute! Wait for me!

834
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:40,892
As long as you're going that way
take me with you!

835
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,103
[Mars screams]

836
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:47,690
At this rate
we'll be there in no time.

837
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:49,484
Oh no! If you here

838
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:52,320
that means you let Unico
back there all alone.

839
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:57,742
Unico? Oh I think
he's all right-whoa!

840
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,964
Oh, what could've
happen to Unico?

841
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:17,303
[music continues]

842
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,483
Do we still have
a long way to go?

843
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:34,445
A long, long way.
And I'm getting hungry.

844
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,948
Unico and Toby,

845
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:38,866
mother and father,

846
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:41,202
I wonder what's happen to them.

847
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:42,912
I'm so alone.

848
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,775
[screams]

849
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:15,445
We're almost there!

850
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:30,251
[music ends]

851
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,046
Is this the End of the Earth?

852
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:34,380
You've got it!

853
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:37,175
And I know just where to look
for the Trojan Horse,

854
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:39,844
my mother told me once. Come on!

855
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:42,055
Hurry up!

856
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:44,807
Thank you!

857
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:47,977
[Cheri and Mars gasp]

858
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:53,274
[Cheri gasps] Unico it's you!

859
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:57,987
I should've know that we never
could've been separated.

860
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,657
-Thank you.
-I can't believe it.

861
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:02,700
Okay, okay, let's go!

862
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:06,162
Are you gonna stand there
all day holding him like that?

863
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:07,538
Come on!

864
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:13,836
Why is there is so much
old junk here?

865
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:15,672
[Mars] Because it's
the End of the Earth.

866
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,926
All the things that nobody wants
get washed up here.

867
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:22,095
[Mars screams]

868
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:27,725
Oh, look! Here comes
some more junk now, huh?

869
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:36,192
[sighs] No wonder somebody
threw this away. [screams]

870
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:40,113
-[Mars screams]
-How sad.

871
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:42,782
This junk could've been fix up
almost good as new.

872
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:46,577
So this is what happens
to all the things nobody wants.

873
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:49,956
-But where is the Trojan Horse?
-I know!

874
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:58,381
Hey, Trojan Horse!
Where are you?

875
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:01,092
This certainly
isn't the Trojan Horse.

876
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,053
-[object 1] You're a human!
-[Cheri gasps]

877
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:05,847
Who said that?

878
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:08,558
-[lantern] A human!
-[vase] Yes a human!

879
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:11,352
-[carriage] A human?
-[object 2] A human!

880
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:12,603
[drum] A human!

881
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:14,981
Just like the ones
that threw us away!

882
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:19,068
[all objects] It's a human!
A human! A human!

883
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,284
All quit your bellyaching!

884
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,786
All of you shut up!

885
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,581
[Mars grunts]

886
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:35,168
Oh, where could
the Trojan Horse be?

887
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:37,044
- Was someone looking for me?
-[Cheri gasps]

888
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:39,672
-Where are you?
-[Trojan Horse] Well, I...

889
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:42,425
I'm right under you, young lady.

890
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:44,177
[gasps] Pardon me!

891
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,637
[grunts] Is that you?

892
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,848
I'm the Trojan Horse.

893
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:52,101
Wow! What a mess of a horse!

894
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:54,771
[Trojan Horse] Am I really
that filthy?

895
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:58,107
You bet you are.
You're disgusting.

896
01:02:58,316 --> 01:02:59,358
-Isn't it?
-Yep.

897
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:01,235
[Trojan Horse] Well,
I'm not surprised,

898
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:03,196
it's been over a thousand years

899
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:06,157
since anyone bother
to give me a good cleaning.

900
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:10,328
Oh, that's all right! If we
just dusty you off...[coughs]

901
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:13,372
You'll be as good as new. See?

902
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:15,792
[Trojan Horse] I thank
you, young lady.

903
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:19,879
[sighs] I feel better already!

904
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:24,550
I'd almost forgotten
what it was like to have

905
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:26,969
someone take care of me.

906
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:28,596
[Cheri] There you go.

907
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:31,474
[coughing]

908
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:35,436
Would you might terribly if we
asked you a question Mr. Horse?

909
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:38,439
[Trojan Horse] It's about
Lord Kuruku, isn't it?

910
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,192
Why don't you take a pick
in my eye young lady?

911
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:42,693
In your eye?
[casual music]

912
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:45,530
Then you already know
about Kuruku?

913
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:48,699
[Trojan Horse laughs] You'd be
surprise that what I know

914
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:52,370
and what I can reveal to you
when you look in my eye.

915
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,956
-[all sigh]
-[Trojan Horse] Very well...

916
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,751
I'll tell you
the story of Kuruku.

917
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:03,381
Long, long ago
Kuruku washed up here

918
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:06,926
just like all the others things
you see about you.

919
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:08,553
[Mars] Look! It's a puppet.

920
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:10,805
[Trojan Horse] Yes,
once upon a time

921
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,932
Kuruku was a marionette

922
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:15,810
but unhappily he fell
into the hands

923
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,104
of some very bad people.

924
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:19,856
[Unico] Bad people?

925
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:23,109
[Trojan Horse] Yes.
A mean tempered old woman

926
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:24,694
and a wicked magician.

927
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:27,655
They mistreated Kuruku terribly,

928
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:30,324
they pulled
and yank at his strings.

929
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:32,785
And when they finally
became a tangled mess

930
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:35,371
they simply threw him away.

931
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,332
[Cheri] They throw him away?

932
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:40,835
[Trojan Horse] As if he was
so much garbage.

933
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:44,422
And after countless years
floating in the sea

934
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:47,216
he washed up here
at the End of the Earth.

935
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:55,892
-[Unico] Look a beam of light!
-[Cheri] What is it?

936
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:58,728
[Trojan Horse] There's only
one spot in the land

937
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,731
at the end of the Earth
where the sun shines.

938
01:05:02,106 --> 01:05:05,192
And then for only
a few moments every day.

939
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:09,155
That is the spot
where Kuruku ended up.

940
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:15,036
And after 200 or 300 years
of this a strange thing happen.

941
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:17,580
[Cheri] He's beginning to move!

942
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:19,165
[Trojan Horse] Just so.

943
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:23,794
The light of the sun is full
of mysterious powers.

944
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:28,966
But at the same time,
it woke him for his long sleep

945
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:32,845
it candled in him a burning
hatred of humanity.

946
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:36,807
For it was humanity
that it throw him away.

947
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:39,310
And so one day,

948
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:44,023
he left the land of the End of
the Earth in search for revenge.

949
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:53,824
So how can we fight
Kuruku's magic?

950
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:56,494
-[Trojan Horse] I don't know.
-[all] What?

951
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:59,121
[Trojan Horse] I only know
that your courage

952
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:01,749
and love are the best
weapons against him.

953
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:04,752
[both] Huh?
Is that all you can say?

954
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:06,879
That is all I can say.

955
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:10,841
You must fight his evil
with your goodness.

956
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:13,386
And you won't know
which is the stronger

957
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:15,388
until the battle is over.

958
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,306
Right, let's go find out!

959
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:19,266
[Cheri] Thank you Mr. Horse!

960
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:21,352
[Trojan Horse] Goodbye

[confidant music]

What's sort of a place
are we going to?

963
01:06:36,283 --> 01:06:38,035
It's called Nightmare Island.

964
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:43,416
[cheers] That sounds
like my kind of a place.

965

[Cheri] There it is!

all that scary. [moans]

[music ends]

968

Okay, so where's
this Kuruku fella?

969
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:29,378
Come on, let me at him.

970
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:31,130
Just let me at him, huh!

971
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:34,133
Huh? Hey, I don't know

972
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:36,302
but I think
maybe I've found him.

973

[gasps] Is he already?

[Kuruku] Is never a moments rest
around here recently.

Who is it this time?

994
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:55,923
Why it feels two insufferable
brats I met not long ago?

995

Why on earth they run
around you supposed.

No, we got to stick together.

I may be mistaken,

1001

-Yes.

1003

a trick on me, hmm?

01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:32,001
Please Kuruku, you can't keep
everyone as your puppet forever.

1007
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:34,795
That's right,
you've got to turn them back.

1010
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:41,177
Why you're try to frighten me?

1011
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:45,890
Toby, I like a word with you!

-[Kuruku] Not you idiot.

Yes, Lord Kuruku,
you have need of me?

1015

Explain yourself!

Let me out! Let me out of here!

1023
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:24,762
[Kuruku] Well, Toby to bring
this game to an end

1024
01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:28,390
I suppose you should have to
turn them into living puppets.

1025
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:31,769
Toby?

1026
01:10:32,853 --> 01:10:34,396
Did you hear what I said?

1027
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:39,318
There's really no other option
open to us now, is there?

1028
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:41,487
Toby!

1029
01:10:42,112 --> 01:10:46,659
I ordered you to turn them
into living puppets, now!

1030
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:49,787
You forget that I am human too,

1031
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:51,747
Lord Kuruku.

1032
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:54,250
Yes, so you are!
[tense music]

1033

And it's amazing to me

1034
01:10:56,961 --> 01:11:00,047
that I've never held
that against you.

1035
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:02,007
I've been waiting for the day

1036
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:03,968
when you turn me
into a puppet as well.

1037
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:07,096
I think that day has come,

1038

after all you're no
longer of any use to me

if you won't obey orders, Toby.

you're match for me?

[laughing] Somehow I believe

1051
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:55,561
you have to do a lot better
than that. [laughing]

that I've forgotten you,

But I want to know,

1067
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:05,464
why do you have
to do such bad things?

1068

Because that the only things
he can do.

won't you turn everyone back?

Yeah, turn them back.

little creatures you are.

Aren't you a least
frightened of me?

-Actually, I'm terrified of you.
-And so am I.

that's the nicest thing

-there's something else.
-[Kuruku] Go ahead.

This is a terrible
life you're living

people makes you happy.

am I? [laughing]

you're making me.

How delightful!

1087
01:14:00,727 --> 01:14:02,604
And to think once upon a time

1088
01:14:02,646 --> 01:14:05,774
I had to hide
my hatred of humans.

1089
01:14:06,066 --> 01:14:08,902
I had to dance when they wanted
to me to dance.

1090
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:11,488
And smile when they wanted
to me to smile.

1091
01:14:13,365 --> 01:14:14,700
But no longer,

1092
01:14:14,741 --> 01:14:17,953
times have changed and the shoe
is on the other foot.

No longer do I take orders
from humans.

Now I just have a little
cleaning up to do outside,

I should never have brought you
to such an evil place.

1112
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:38,033
Unico run!

[Kuruku laughing]

-Kuruku!
-Stop it! [grunts]

1118
01:16:11,483 --> 01:16:14,319
Stay away from me,
I had about enough of this.

1119
01:16:14,486 --> 01:16:16,154
Huh? [screams]

1120
01:16:20,617 --> 01:16:21,952
What's the big idea?

1121
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:24,037
Look what you've
done to my tail.

1122

There, I think that takes care

1126
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:38,176
of all the little
annoyances for today.

1127
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:39,761
[Unico] Not quite Kuruku.

1128
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:43,098
Who's that?
What a resilient little fellow.

1129
01:16:43,348 --> 01:16:45,726
You're not finished
until you taken care of me.

[monster screaming]

1133
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:21,970
Kuruku is time
you let your puppets go.

1134
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:25,891
You intolerable little
rotten muffin, how dare you?

1135
01:17:32,522 --> 01:17:33,523
[Unico screams]

1136
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:35,901
[laughs] He's fast,

1137
01:17:36,026 --> 01:17:37,986
I haven't had this
much fun in years.

1138
01:17:39,446 --> 01:17:42,240
[moans] I don't what I can do.

1139
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:45,202
Maybe if I just keep on running
I can tire him out.

1140
01:17:48,955 --> 01:17:52,250
No matter where you are
you cannot escape.

[grunts and moans]

1149
01:18:30,163 --> 01:18:32,249
There is nowhere left to go.

1150
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:33,792
I let everybody down.

1151
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:41,883
And so the curtain falls
you little pain in the neck.

[Kuruku laughing]

1161
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:39,149
Well, that was certainly
very exciting. [laughing]

1162
01:19:40,066 --> 01:19:41,401
[Unico] Kuruku!

1163

-[Kuruku sighs]
-Please Kuruku,

1164
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:47,491
break the spell
and release all your puppets.

1165
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:50,118
If you don't,
I'll be force to fight you

1166
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:51,620
and I might have to...

1167
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:54,289
destroy you
and I rather not do that.

1168
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,584
Why you insignificant
little brat--

1169
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:05,884
I am through playing
games with you!

[anticipatory music]

How do you like that?

1173
01:20:28,448 --> 01:20:32,285
Now you have no place to run,
you've fallen in glue pot.

1174
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:34,663
I don't plan on running anymore.

1175
01:20:35,038 --> 01:20:37,874
You leave me no choice
but to fight you Kuruku.

1176
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:40,836
I'll struggle to hide my terror.

1177
01:20:41,294 --> 01:20:43,046
Prepare to die!

1178
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:45,340
[Unico screams] Ya!

1179
01:20:46,466 --> 01:20:48,468

I should've known I never
stand a chance against him.

1184

[Kuruku screams and grunts]

1185
01:21:17,163 --> 01:21:18,874
What are you talking about?

1186
01:21:19,749 --> 01:21:21,167
This is more than a scratch.

1187
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:24,337
But I had no idea
I hardly touched you.

1188
01:21:24,504 --> 01:21:25,881
I'm sorry.

1189
01:21:26,631 --> 01:21:30,135
[sighs] Why are you saying
that your sorry?

1190
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:32,429
Why?

1191
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:37,309
-Because I feel sorry for you.
-You feel?

1192
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:42,522
What do you mean
you feel sorry for me?

1193
01:21:44,524 --> 01:21:47,193
I'm sorry
that you're full of... [grunts]

1194
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:49,237
so much hate.

1195
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:54,618
You think that all people
are your enemies

1196
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:57,495
but that's only because
you've never had a friend.

1197
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:00,832
Did you say 'a friend'?

1198
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:03,501
I know how important
friends are.

1199
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:06,254
-That's why I understand you.
-[Kuruku gasps]

1200
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:07,923
Please, stop it.

1201
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:11,426
The idea of me
being someone's friend...

1202
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:17,057
it's making me feel
quite ill. [screams]

1203
01:22:18,683 --> 01:22:21,227
I know what happen
to you long ago.

1204
01:22:21,853 --> 01:22:24,522
I know that some people
treated you badly.

1205
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:28,318
If you had a friend you'd know
that not everyone is like that.

1206
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:30,028
You must be very lonely.

1207
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,906
Lonely!

1208
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:37,327
He says that I'm lonely!

1209
01:22:38,995 --> 01:22:41,539
But don't you understand?

1210
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:44,250
I hate people!

1211
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:46,044
I do! [grunts and cries]

1212
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:51,675
[Unico grunts]

1213
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:53,885
What's wrong Kuruku?

1214
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:56,596
How can you be so cruel?

1215
01:22:56,721 --> 01:22:59,557
All this talk of friendship
and understand

1216
01:22:59,557 --> 01:23:02,686
is making me feel
all soft and gooey.

[screams]

1218
01:23:04,854 --> 01:23:07,691
I live only to hate humanity

1219
01:23:07,732 --> 01:23:10,318
and now you tell me
that I'm lonely,

1220
01:23:10,735 --> 01:23:12,445
that people are good.

1221
01:23:12,696 --> 01:23:14,698
Like a I need a friend.

1222
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:19,452
Your words are melting my heart.

1223
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:21,830
[Kuruku screams]

1224
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:25,709
Kuruku don't worry
I'll be your friend, okay?

1225
01:23:26,042 --> 01:23:27,711
[Kuruku screams]

1226
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:31,172
If you free all the puppets
from your magic spell

1227
01:23:31,297 --> 01:23:34,592
-I'll be your friend forever.
-[Kuruku screams]

1228
01:23:35,093 --> 01:23:36,344
That word again.

1229
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,764
Who would ever want
to be a friend of mine?

1230
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:41,182
Who?
[sad music continues]

1231
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:44,019
Oh, wait Kuruku
don't be frighten.

1232
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:46,980
Anyone can have a friend,
really.

1233
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:50,859
It's too late for me I'm afraid.

[Unico] What's happening?

1237
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:05,165
[Kuruku] My hatred was
the only thing

1238
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:06,666
that kept me alive.

1239
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:10,086
You've taken it from me,
I have nothing left.

1240
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:13,048
But for the first time
in my life

1241
01:24:13,423 --> 01:24:15,383
I can hardly say it...

1242
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:17,635
I feel good!

1243
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:23,641
[emotive music]

1244
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:02,091
-[woman] Unico!
-What?

1245
01:27:02,342 --> 01:27:05,428
Did someone called me? [moans]

1246
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:11,643
Unico my child it's time
to you to leave this place.

1247
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:13,811
-Leave?
-Yes.

1248
01:27:13,853 --> 01:27:16,439
The gods will soon discover
what you've done here.

1249
01:27:16,856 --> 01:27:18,983
I must take you
some place far away

1250
01:27:18,983 --> 01:27:20,485
where they cannot find you.

1251
01:27:21,527 --> 01:27:22,654
But why?

1252
01:27:23,446 --> 01:27:25,531
Because that is your faith,
Unico.

1253
01:27:26,032 --> 01:27:27,116
Come.

1254

[calm music]

May I at least
to say goodbye to Cheri?

1256

She will never forget you.
