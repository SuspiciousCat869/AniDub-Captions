Who all is in?

182
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,928
The great thief Lupin or
Inspector Zenigata of Interpol?

183
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,014
It's the start of the Grand Prix race!

184
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,933
Betting odds are 100 to one!

185

(grim music)

214
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:23,307
- Why is that long-armed ape still alive?

215
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,811
Shouldn't he have been dead
a long time ago, Kowalski?

216

(Kowalski grunting)

217
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,523
- Don't worry about it, Junior,

218
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,527
I'll make sure he's taken
care of before the morning,

219
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,028
don't you worry about it.

220
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,154
- [Marciano] How are you gonna do it?

221
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,155
- You tell me.

222
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,699
Do you prefer that I float him

223
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,701
or sink him in the Hudson River, huh?

224
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,704
- You can float him.

225
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,081
And I think I'll drink a
toast with my girlfriend

226
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,125
as we look out over the river.

227
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,378

a long shot like this!

- [Woman] Nobody's gonna bet on Zenigata!

238
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,118
- [Man] You could say that again!

239
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,912
- Lupin, I'm waiting! (kiss smacking)

240
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,247
Hurry now!

241
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,332
- Ah, Fuji-cakes!

242
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,001
I'll be right over!

(Zenigata chuckling)

You can't catch me, Pops!

to do better than that!

Whee!

I got you now!

Let go of that, I need-

280
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,503
I'll get you next time if
it's the last thing I do,

Half of all the take
goes to Marciano, right?

292
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,239

- [Mike] Uh-huh.

308
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,486
- [Kowalski] This is
no ordinary flyswatter.

309
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,279
Listen up, Willy.

310
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,280
- [Willy] Yes, sir.

311
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,574
- Now pay attention, I'm
only gonna say this once.

This goes for any member of the mafia.

The first time you sees this,
you'll turn a bashful red.

you'll turn a terrified white.

316
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,419
And the third time you sees
it, you'll turn purple!

You get the joke?

319
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,341
You'll be purple because you'll be dead.

320
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,426
It's the flyswatter of death.

00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,355
(Lupin stammering)

336
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,483
(phone ringing)

337
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,027
(scissors snipping)

338
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,653
- (stammering) Rosetta!

339
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:10,487
(coin clinking)

340
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,321
Huh?

341
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,743
It's a ghost!

342
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,622
(Rosetta laughing)

343
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:24,376
- Nope, still got my legs
right where they belong, look!

344
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,377
- [Lupin] Huh?

345
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,881
- I've been helping myself
up, hope you don't care.

346
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,632
(Rosetta gulping)

347
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,593
(Lupin sighing)

348
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,636
- It's okay, Rosetta,
you can have the whiskey,

349
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:35,846
but you can't stay here.

350
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,057
Now, beat it, go on!

351
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,349
- No can do!

352
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,769
I can't leave without paying you back,

353
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:46,231
I'm a believer in paying
back today's debts today!

354
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,234
(upbeat rock music)

355
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,278
(radio warbling)

356
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,281
(smooth jazz music)

357
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,367
- Huh?

358
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,913
Hey, old lady, what do
you think you're doing?

359
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,999
(Rosetta moaning)

360
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,251
- Look!

361
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,461
(Lupin shuddering)

362
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,588
What do you think of my dance, Lupin?

363
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:13,550
I may not look it, but long ago
I danced all over the world,

364
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,219
I was the toast of Europe!

365
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,305
- What the?

366
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,890
Okay, that's enough, Rosetta!

367
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,059
(radio clicking)

368
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,268
You've paid me back enough,

369
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,604
just consider yourself paid in full.

370
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,022
- How uncouth!

371
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:30,484
It's not with my dancing that
I'm gonna pay you back, Lupin.

372
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,318
- What?

373
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,197
- Now, Lupin, I want you to take me!

374
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,907
(Lupin yelping)

375
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,075
(Lupin crashing)

376
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,744
(playful music)

377
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,166
- Ah!

378
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,420
(Lupin whimpering)

379
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,175
(Rosetta laughing)

380
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,844
You're cute, Lupin!

381
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:57,761
- Yeah, who asked you?

382
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,764
- [Rosetta] Let me tell
you something wonderful.

383
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,349
- No, that, that's all right!

384
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,479
- Listen, this is important!

385
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,274
Long ago in the 5th century, Babylon,

386
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:14,236
the capital of the thriving
Mesopotamian civilization,

387
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,863
was said to have been destroyed

388
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,782
by the advancing army of Persia.

389
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:22,286
It is also believe that
before Babylon was destroyed

390
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:26,248
a god appeared and gathered
up all the gold in Babylon

391
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,708
and hid it away somewhere.

392
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,542
- Yeah?

393
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,918
So what about it?

394
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:33,005
(calm pensive music)

395
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:38,260
- That god called this golden
treasure the Wealth of Babylon

396
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,137
and inside this candelabra-

397
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,098
(gunshots booming)
(Rosetta screaming)

398
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:46,143
(bottle shattering)

399
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,521
(Lupin yelping)

400
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,441
(Lupin whimpering)

401
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,528
(doorknob clattering)

402
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,655
(door thudding)

403
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,489
(both yelping)

404
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,158
- [Willy] He's still there!

405
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:05,245
- So you came around, huh,
New York mafia cockroaches?

406
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,288
Rosetta, put me down-
- No, no, no, no, no

407
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,873
no, no, no, no, no!
- Put me down, put me down!

408
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,957
- I'll shoot him, Chin.

409
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,460
- No, me wanna kill Lupin!

410
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,462
- Now move it, old lady!

411
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,631
- Lupin, we'll die together!

412
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,798
- No way, no!

413
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:21,803
(gunshots thundering)
(Lupin grunting)

414
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,139
(all grunting)

415
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,308
(all growling)
(gunshots thundering)

416
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,310
(guns clicking)

417
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,979
(Lupin humming)

418
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,484
(bullets clattering)

419
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,986
(all whimpering)

420
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,613
(mechanism whirring)

421
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,447
Heh.

422
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,450
You see that, you mafia creepos?

423
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,244
Lead bullets don't get through to me!

424
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,621
Oh, I accept bricks of gold.

425
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,707
Uh, I mean, bullets of gold
or diamond bullets maybe.

426
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,626
Now, go on, stick 'em up.

427
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,002
(all groaning)

428
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,296
Uh, is there something
you guys wanna tell me?

429
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,631
(door creaking)

430
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,966
- You finished yet?

431
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,425
- No, not quite yet.

432
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,552
Can't just let them all go, now can I?

433
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,428

Hm?

450
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,982

seems to somehow know that
I'm trying to get close

to Marciano and sniff out
the secret of Babylon.

Who the hell is she?

(Fujiko panting)

466
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,400
- [Fujiko] This pool is really fabulous!

467
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,616
What are you painting over there anyway?

468
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,785
- I thought of painting a long-armed ape,

469
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:53,372
but I've moved on to
something more interesting.

470
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:57,751
- Oh, now it's a statue of a golden lion?

471
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,629
The other day it was a
golden coffin, right?

472
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,672
You do a lot of dreaming, don't you?

473
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,134
But I wonder if all the gold of Babylon

474
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,969
is really there, is it?

475
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:11,098
- It is, it's true, don't
you believe me, Fujiko?

476
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,183
- It's always just talk with you.

477
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,477
I would like you to
show me a little action.

478
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,817
(water splashing)

479

(water splashing)

481
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,383
- How's that for an engagement ring?

482
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,969
- Don't misunderstand me, Marciano.

483
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,846
I told you that I would give you my love

484
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,765
only after you found the Gold of Babylon.

485
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:58,770
(water splashing)
(Marciano grunting)

486
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:02,190
- I'll find the Gold
of Babylon anytime now.

487
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,025
My organization's making an all out

488
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,319
search effort for it, Fujiko.

489
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,739
I mean, I'm not just doing all
of this on some kinda whim!

490
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,741
It's an important enterprise dating back

491
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:14,202
to my father's time, you know?

492
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,495
- I'm tired of hearing that.

493
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,664
I think I'll just go back to Tokyo soon.

494
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,000
- Fujiko!
(Fujiko gasping)

(Marciano grunting)
(canvas tearing)

496
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,891
All right, come on outta there,

497
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,642
I'm gonna show you some action!

00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,021
- Okay, but hang on a sec.

500
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:41,855
(Fujiko gasping)

501
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,691
(water splashing)

502
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,619
(water splashing)

503
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,455
(water trickling)

504
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,551
(water splashing)

505
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,012
- Open Sesame.

506
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:14,846
(door whirring)

507
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:18,808
(bright mystical music)

508
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,894
You see, years ago my father gave up

509
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,980
all of his control of his
territory to Lucky Luciano,

510
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,150
but it's not because he got fed
up with the family business.

511
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,694
It was because the search
for the Gold of Babylon

512
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,821
completely captivated him.

513
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:34,199
It all started when some
clay tablets were found

514
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:37,077
at a subway construction site
under Madison Square Garden.

515
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:46,294
(crowd cheering)
(boxers grunting)

516
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,894
(drill whirring)

517
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,647
(rocks crashing)

518
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,614
What were clay tablets inscribed
with Babylonian cuneiforms

519
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:17,325
doing buried deep underground in New York?

520
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:20,662
To this day it remains
an unsolved mystery,

521
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,665
but from that moment my father
completely washed his hands

522
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,458
of the organized crime business

523
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:30,213
and threw himself into
excavating the ruins of Babylon.

524
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,596
(man shouting in foreign language)

525
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,097
(cannons booming)

526
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,350
(planes whooshing)

527
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,854
Unfortunately, at the exact
same time, Hitler sent

528
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:49,316
a large archeological
investigation unit to Iraq.

529
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:52,068
(crowd cheering)

530
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:56,489
Hitler was searching for
the same thing as my father:

531
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,658
pure gold!

532
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:01,953
A completely pure gold
object created by order

533
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,956
of King Nebuchadnezzar
from gold of Babylonia.

534
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:05,999
- An object?

535
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,459
- I don't know what form it takes,

536
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:11,046
but there is no doubt that
it is nothing but pure gold.

537
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,882
The many clay tablets that
my father's team excavated

538
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,717
as much as said so.

539
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,970
And so I decided to carry
on my father's enterprise,

540
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,680
leaving the organization in the hands

541
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,266
of Kowalski, another syndicate boss.

542
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,147
(door whirring)

543
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,484
(Fujiko gasping)

544
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,902
- Oh, it's great!

545
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,074
- [Marciano] Close Sesame.

546
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,743
(door whirring)

547
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,686
Well done, Fujiko, you went
right to the good stuff.

548
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,938
You do have impeccable taste.

549
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:13,650
- Tell me, are these the
famous Manhattan inscriptions?

550
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,859
- Yeah, that's right.

551
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,903
According to the word on the street,

552
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,823
50 clay tablets have
been found in Manhattan.

553
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,701
Of those 50, 40 of them are right here!

554
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:23,952
- What?

555
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,620
Well, this is odd.

556
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,498
Aren't cuneiforms supposed
to be gouged inward?

557
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,458
'Cause these are facing outward.

558
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:36,464
I wonder if they could
be inverse characters.

559
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,091
- Are you able to read them?

560
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,592
- [Fujiko] Oh, no!

561
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,428
- I'm impressed, Fujiko.

562
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:45,056
As you just said, the Manhattan
Babylonian inscriptions

563
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,058
are all inverse characters.

564
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:50,478
- [Fujiko] Yes, I knew it,
it's just as Lupin said!

565
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,438
- [Marciano] Huh?

566
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:54,941
- Lupin has gathered several
tablets similar to these.

567
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,862
He doesn't have as many as this though.

568
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,113
- What the hell?

569
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:03,283
So you're saying that he's after
the same thing that we are?

570
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,784
- Oh, didn't you know that?

571
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:07,662
Lupin has thoroughly
investigated the Gold of Babylon

572
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,664
along with your father too.

573
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,083
He knows about them and you.

574
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,752
- I'll kill him, I'll kill him!

575
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,003
That long-armed ape,

576
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,172
that irritating creep, that petty thief!

577
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,883
- That's not very nice.

578
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,635
What would Lupin say if he heard that?

579
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,554
(pendant clicking)

580
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,097
(Marciano grunting)

581
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,724
(Fujiko yelping)

582
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,184
(fabric tearing)

583
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,810
- A concealed camera, huh?

584
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,644
(fabric tearing)

585
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:32,979
(Fujiko gasping)

586
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,439
You've been sneaking photos!

587
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,857
(grim frantic music)

588
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,234
(Marciano grunting)
(Fujiko screaming)

589
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,320
(Fujiko grunting)

590
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,279
(Fujiko booming)

591
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,741
(Marciano coughing)

592
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,575
Huh?

593
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:48,870
- Pervert!

594
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,414
How nasty!

595
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,082
What are you going to do to me?

596
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:55,502
(upbeat energetic music)

597
00:29:55,502 --> 00:30:00,507
(Marciano grunting)
(Lupin laughing)

598
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,927
- Lupin, you can't get outta here!

599
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,386
- Don't you worry about that.

600
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,891
I've got your voice recorded
on this tape recorder here.

601
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,143
- [Marciano] Open Sesame.

602
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:15,647
(Lupin laughing)

603
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,858
(Marciano grunting)

604
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,736
- Don't worry, I'll take
the Treasure of Babylon!

605
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:22,570
Nighty night!

606
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,449
(plane roaring)

607
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,201
(cameras clicking)

608
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,744
- Tell us about the new job, Lupin!

609
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:30,829
- I signed an NDA.

610
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,914
- What do you think of
the female students?

611
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:33,748
- They're cute!

612
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,041
(all laughing)

613
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,209
- [Reporter] What foods don't you like?

614
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,043
- [Lupin] Octopus!

615
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,963
Oh yeah, I'm thinking of
going to Paris for escargot.

616
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,006
- How about a word for Inspector Zenigata?

617
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,593
(fist thudding)

618
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:46,970
- Commissioner, listen here!

619
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,264
You have to assign me a
team for the sole purpose

620
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,057
of apprehending and arresting Lupin!

621
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,476
- [Reporter] What foods don't you like?

622
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:54,519
- [Lupin] Octopus!

623
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,397
Oh yeah, I'm thinking of
going to Paris for escargot.

624
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,231
- [Reporter In Green] How about a word

625
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,649
for Inspector Zenigata?

626
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,608
(Lupin chuckling)

627
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,110
- [Lupin] Neener-neener!

628
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,611
(Zenigata grunting)

629
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,655
- Oh, why you, Lupin!

630
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:06,948
- Neener-neener-
- How dare you

631
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,283
make fun of me, Lupin!
- Neener-neener!

632
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,701
Neener-neener!
(television booming)

633
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,077
Neener-neener, neener-neener!

634
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,203
- Why you little!
- Neener-neener!

635
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,329
(television booming)

636
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,581
- Zenigata!
- Huh?

637
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:18,084
- As of today, I am removing
you from the Lupin detail!

638
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,503
- No, no, Commissioner, you can't do that!

639
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,755
- These are your new orders, you loon!

640
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,090
- No, no, no!

641
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,260
Commissioner, I work only on
the Lupin case, nothing else!

642
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,386
- No, no, no!

643
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,139
And if you complain about
it, you'll be discharged!

644
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,640
(Zenigata grunting)

645
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,475
- Ladies and gentlemen passing by,

646
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,436
please pardon this disturbance.

647
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,604
Please don't be alarmed,

648
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,939
this is an Interpol publicity balloon.

649
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,775
From Alaska in the North
to New Guinea in the South,

650
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,320
50 police women representing
the police forces

651
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,363
of all the world's nations will compete

652
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:51,409
in the Miss ICPO International
Police Women Beauty Contest.

653
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,037
It's gonna be real humdinger,
so please don't miss it.

654
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,622
Thank you for your attention.

655
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,165
(fireworks booming)

656
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,501
(grand energetic music)

657
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,838
Entry number nine!

658
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,716
From the U.S., Miss Caramel!

659
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,094
(audience cheering)

660
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,013
(Caramel chuckling)

661
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,807
(kisses smacking)

662
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,937
Scram!

663
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,272
- [Caramel] I love you!

664
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,106
(Zenigata chuckling)

665
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:22,941
(audience laughing)

666
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,652
- [Zenigata] Entry number 11
from China, Miss Qing Xiao!

667
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:30,949
(Qing Xiao speaking in foreign language)

668
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:31,783
Hey!

669
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,951
(Zenigata grunting)

670
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,744
(audience laughing)

671
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:38,498
Entry number 35 from
the USSR, Miss Zakskaya!

672
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:43,878
(Zakskaya speaking in foreign language)

673
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:44,963
Okay!

674
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,923
(Zenigata grunting)
(audience laughing)

675
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,926
And now introducing entry number 41

676
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,637
from Kenya, Miss Saranda.

677
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,973
(Saranda grunting)

678
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,976
(Zenigata yelping)

679
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,895
(triumphant music)

680
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:11,906
(scissors clicking)

681
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,997
- And now what you've
all been waiting for.

682
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,873
And the winner is

683
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,460
entry number 26

684
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:28,006
from Italy, Miss Lasagna!

685
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,257
- [Lasagna] Oh!

686
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:34,262
(audience cheering)
(triumphant music)

687
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,060
- [Qing Xiao] How did
that ugly pig get chosen?

688
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,063
The judging process is
extremely fishy to me!

689
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,523
- It's extremely fishy!

690
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,816
(commissioner yelping)
(women grunting)

691
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:47,692
We want a do-over!

692
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,111
- Well, are we going to
have a do-over or not?

693
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,489
- Man, what a situation!

694
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:56,284
How can ICPO, the premier
agency in the world,

695
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,745
get away with time wasters like this?

696
00:33:58,745 --> 00:33:59,996
(Zenigata grunting)

697
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,122
- Zenigata, wait!

698
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,415
(commissioner panting)

699
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,958
- Hey, commissioner, what happened?

700
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,585
What's the matter?

701
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,962
- I'm, I'm reassigning you to Lupin.

702
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,172
- Wha?

703
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,424
Is, is that true, sir?

704
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:14,719
Commissioner, I, uh, I
live to arrest Lupin!

705
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,553
(Zenigata sobbing)

706
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,388
- Zenigata, in addition, I want you

707
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,308
to take on some additional responsibility.

708
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,894
As of today, I assign
these subordinates to you,

709
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,562
and Miss Lasagna also!

710
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,898
- (chuckling) Just you wait, Lupin!

711
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,775
This time I'll throw you and your gang

712
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,985
in the slammer where you belong!

(computer beeping)

718
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,955
- And now what we've all been waiting for,

719
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:46,250
the translation of the
Manhattan inscriptions!

720
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,170

721
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:55,635
\"A god ordered, 'Gather all
the gold of the country,

\"'build a safe place to store it.'

\"Its location is to the south
of Babylon, signed Cupid.\"

724
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,685
(Lupin laughing)

725
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,855
A place with all the county's
gold, how about that, guys?

726
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:11,317
It's gotta be tens of
thousands of tons, you know?

727
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,402
- Sorry, Lupin, I don't believe

728
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,029
in any stories with gods in them.

729
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,989
Sounds like a fairytale to me.

730
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:20,243
- I don't really believe in any
of that stuff either, Jigen.

731
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,495
This stuff about a god is
definitely just something

732
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,831
the king made up to
hide his own activities.

733
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,125
- Even if I believe in
the Treasure of Babylon,

734
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,418
I don't accept where
the writings were found.

735
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,504
What is it doing in America?

736
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,131
What business do they have being in

737
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,966
the earth of New York City?

738
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,426
- I don't really know, that's
the one conflicting detail

739
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,428
of his whole story of the
hidden treasure chest,

740
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:40,555
wouldn't you say?

741
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,640
- Hm, I'm out.

742
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,185
- Hey, wait, Goemon, I'll figure
this thing out, you'll see!

743
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:48,312
This could be our biggest score yet!

744
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,606
(Jigen grunting)

745
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,191
Whoa, wait, Jigen!

746
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,651
This is a colossal treasure,

747
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,403
which even Alexander the Great is said

748
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,488
to have searched for in antiquity!

749
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:01,242
More recently, Napoleon and Hitler!

750
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,744
Men throughout history who
have plotted world conquest

751
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,371
have been obsessed with this treasure,

752
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:08,916
and you want me to just give
it to these lowlife gangsters?

753
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,254
- You need to chill out, Lupin.

754
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,506
- You're chickening
out, aren't you, Jigen?

755
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,966
(Lupin mumbling)

756
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,384
(Lupin grunting)

757
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,428
- Nobody said that I'm not in.

758
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,804
We're out of cognac.

759
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,562
(door thudding)

760
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,151
- Con a yak for all I care!

761
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:42,825
The conditions under which
the clay tablets were found.

762
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:46,412
(mysterious pensive music)

763
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,543
Hm, what the?

764
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,089
(door clicking)

765
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:57,924
Huh?

766
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:03,179
(Rosetta hiccuping)

767
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,306
- Lupin, I love you!

768
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,974
(Lupin screaming)

769
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:10,186
(wacky music)

770
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:13,231
- Excuse me, but what do you mean by love?

771
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,065
Is it kissing?

772
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,900
If so, then would you please don't?

773
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,735
- Oh, come on, don't be shy!

774
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,571
Alex used to kiss me
a hundred times a day!

775
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,697
- Huh?

776
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,449
Who in the world is Alex?

777
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,951
- Alexander!

778
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,662
Leo was also in love with me.

779
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,331
He was always getting fresh, which is why

780
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:34,293
he didn't get enough sleep and
kept falling off his horse!

781
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,253
(Rosetta laughing)

782
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,087
- Huh?

783
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,047
When was this, old lady?

784
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:41,300
- [Rosetta] The Battle of
Waterloo, that's when it happened!

785
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:46,180
- You're saying that Leo was Napoleon?

786
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,976
- Yes, yes, Napoleon!

787
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,769
He was a cute one!

788
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,271
- That's impossible!

789
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,274
She can't be talking
about the real Napoleon.

790
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,108
Huh?

791
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,736
- South of Babylon.

792
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:08,286
Ah!

793
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,747
(Rosetta moaning)

794
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:14,250
- Ah, enough, enough, stop it already!

795
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,963
- You should come down! (kiss smacking)

796
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,757
You don't know what you're missing!

797
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:26,095
Oh, there it is, I was
wondering where it was.

798
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,848
I've been looking all over for this!

799
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:37,440
You see, every 76 years it
sits on the Tower of Babel.

800
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:38,733
- Hey there, old lady?

801
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:42,528
What is the deal with the comet
on that candelabra anyway?

802
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,947
What does it have to do with
the Treasure of Babylon?

803
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:48,784
- God rides on a comet to
see the Gold of Babylon.

804
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:51,954
It's all part of the
legend, you see, Lupin.

805
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,914
- So what about you?

806
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,666
Are you supposed to be God's guide

807
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,460
along the way or something?

808
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,003
(Rosetta laughing)

809
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,881
- Lupin, you're going to Babylon, right?

810
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:05,426
You should remember, dark holes await you.

811
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,886
Dark holes!

812
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,929
Dark holes!

813
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,349

00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:33,744
- What?

993
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:34,578
- Later, Pops!

994
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:35,412
- Get back here-

995
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,790
(gunshots thundering)
(Zenigata yelping)

996
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:42,085
(helicopter whirring)
(adventurous jazzy music)

997
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,420
(Lupin panting)

998
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,254
(Lupin yelping)

999
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,506
(Qing Xiao yelling)

1000
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:49,551
(Qing Xiao shouting)

1001
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,055
(Qing Xiao shouting)

1002
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:53,931
- [Goemon] Huh?

1003
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,767
(Qing Xiao shouting)

1004
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,268
- [Qing Xiao] Huh?

1005
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,104
- Discretion.

1006
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,314
- Uh.

1007
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,649
Oh!

1008
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,233
Uh, I am Qing Xiao.

1009
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,653
- My name is Goemon.

1010
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:09,446
Pardon me.

1011
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:14,868
(both panting)
(frantic music)

1012
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:17,871
(gunshots thundering)

1013
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:20,791
(couple screaming)

1014
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:25,504
(couple screaming)

1015
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:29,466
- All right, hold it right there, Lupin!

1016
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,384
- Hey, Pops!

1017
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,386
- I finally got you!

1018
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,638
- [Lupin] No time for this!

1019
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:36,640
- Hey, Lupin!

1020
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,642
(gunshots thundering)

1021
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:42,354
(tense dramatic music)

1022
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,106
(door crashing)

1023
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:47,275
(gangsters screaming)

1024
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:51,154
- [Lupin] Whoopsie!

1025
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,948
- Come back here, you weasel!

1026
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,033
(Zenigata grunting)

1027
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,201
(Lupin panting)

1028
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,619
Hold it, Lupin!

1029
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:59,079
(helicopter whirring)

1030
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,747
(gunshots thundering)

1031
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:03,250
(all panting)

1032
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:08,005
(Lupin yelping)

1033
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,133
(gunshots thundering)

1034
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,969
- (sighing) I swear these
guys don't know when to quit!

1035
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:17,014
(Qing Xiao shouting)

1036
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:17,848
- Huh?
(Qing Xiao shouting)

1037
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,767
(gangster yelping)

1038
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,604
- Lupin, you're under arrest!

1039
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:28,108
(sword clanking)

1040
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:31,319
(metal clattering)

1041
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:32,821
Huh?

1042
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:35,782
(Zenigata grunting)

1043
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:37,909
- You really hang in there!

1044
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:38,994
- Damn you!

1045
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:41,038
When I catch you I'm gonna...

1046
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:44,041
(Zenigata grunting)

1047
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:49,796
- Coochie coochie coochie coo!

1048
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:53,091
(Zenigata groaning)

1049
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,593
(Zenigata sneezing)

1050
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:55,886
(kiss smacking)

1051
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,472
I'll catch you later, Pops! (chuckling)

1052
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,390
- Damn you, Lupin!

1053
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,976
Don't you think that you've gotten away!

1054
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:06,480
(wistful music)

1055
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,732
- Hey, Goemon, what's wrong?

1056
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,108
Huh?

1057
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:12,611
(gangster grunting)

1058
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:13,445
- I won't forget.

1059
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,572
You are such a lovely flower.

1060
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:21,286
- You're in love, aren't you, Goemon?

1061
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:22,537
- Now I get it!

1062
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:26,583
(helicopter whirring)

1063
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:27,501
Run!
(gunshots thundering)

1064
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:28,335
Not again!

1065
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:34,257
(explosions booming)
(grim dramatic music)

1066
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:43,141
(gunshots thundering)
(Lupin yelping)

1067
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,689
(gunshots booming)

1068
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:52,275
(gangsters yelping)

1069
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:55,195
(gangster yelling)

1070
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:01,076
(helicopter whirring)

1071
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:04,871
(helicopter crashing)

1072
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:08,041
(gangsters screaming)

1073
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:12,546
(explosion booming)

1074
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:18,176
(train horn blaring)

1075
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:34,359
(gentle somber music)

1076
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:07,642
(man singing in foreign language)

1077
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:16,318
(people chattering)

1078
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,536
(engine rumbling)

1079
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:32,584
- Lupin, there's an
Italian archeological team

1080
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:35,378
already digging directly
south of the ruins of Babylon.

1081
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,546
Did you know about that?

1082
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:40,175
- Yes, the leader is Dr.
Tartini, isn't that right?

1083
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,092
- It is.

1084
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:42,969
- He worked for the Marciano organization

1085
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,763
until Iraq's sultanate was overthrown.

1086
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,556
Or, to put it in simpler terms,

1087
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,558
he's nothing but a grave robber.

1088
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:52,604
- So has this Tartini
expedition dug up anything?

1089
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:55,815
- Yeah, 10 days ago, the Tower of Babel.

1090
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:57,192
- The Tower of Babel?

1091
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:58,443
What? (grunting)

1092
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:01,321
(jeep rattling)

1093
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,155
- Oh, come on!

1094
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:04,241
If my history serves
me, the Tower of Babel

1095
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,825
was dug up a long time ago.

1096
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:07,869
In the remains of the Babylonian temple,

1097
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:10,205
they found several clay
tablets with inscriptions

1098
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,957
identical to those in the Old Testament

1099
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,583
and it came to be accepted that that

1100
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,877
was the authentic Tower of Babel, right?

1101
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:18,838
- However, it seems that
that one was the second tower

1102
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:22,175
and that this one is much
older and much more historic,

1103
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:24,010
or so Tartini says.

1104
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:29,599
- Hm, do you think that
maybe it's possible

1105
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,060
that Marciano has already
dug up the treasure?

1106
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,938
- Didn't you say that it would
be tens of thousands of tons?

1107
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:37,941
How would anyone be able to
move something that heavy?

1108
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,109
- Knowing him, he'll take it

1109
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,569
even if he has to mobilize an entire army.

1110
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:44,406
(engine rumbling)

1111
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:50,412
(wind whistling)

1112
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:02,299
Wow, that's really something!

1113
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,676
I had no idea it was as big as this.

1114
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,640
- [Jigen] I don't see
any second tower, do you?

1115
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,891
- [Fujiko] You're right!

1116
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,770
That round area couldn't be

1117
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,398
the top of the tower, now could it?

1118
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:19,816
Or is it?

1119
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,568
Why would there be such a structure

1120
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:23,361
in the middle of nowhere?

1121
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:26,990
- Well, in any case, the
treasure is buried in that area.

1122
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,283
Hm? Huh?

1123
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:29,534
Ah!

1124
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:30,952
Here he comes, here he comes!

1125
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:32,787
It's Marciano's grand entrance!

1126
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:34,998
- [Fujiko] Yes, well,
Marciano is actually footing

1127
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:38,668
the entire bill for
this investigative team.

1128
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:39,502
- Huh?

1129
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:41,504
- Ah, welcome!

1130
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,007
- Hey, Tartini.

1131
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:48,219
- All righty then, we'll do
it after it gets dark, okay?

1132
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:50,722
- Right.

1133
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:54,351
(wind whistling)

1134
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,146
(fires crackling)

1135
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:04,944
(engine rumbling)

1136
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:19,376
(machine whirring)

1137
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:27,050
By the way, Goemon, how do
I use this rucksack anyway?

1138
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:27,884
(metal clanking)

1139
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:28,718
(machine whirring)

1140
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:31,721
(Lupin yelping)

1141
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:32,931
- [Fujiko] Oh!

1142
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:36,017
(upbeat funky music)

1143
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:41,314
(Lupin whimpering)

1144
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,321
(Lupin grunting)

1145
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,414
(Lupin yelping)

1146
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:04,963
(air whooshing)

1147
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:07,715
(Lupin grunting)

1148
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:13,179
- Whoa!
(men yelping)

1149
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:15,849
(Lupin yelping)

1150
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,601
(Lupin grunting)

1151
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,815
(Lupin yelling)

1152
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:27,819
(grunting) Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

1153
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:36,077
(flashlight clicking)

1154
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:36,911
Huh?

1155
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,334
This is a terrible welcome mat!

A score, if memory serves,

1166
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:22,123
means a gouge or a pit, isn't that right?

1167
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:24,542

Long ago, I was called upon by
God to descend to the Earth.

1191
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:02,932
- [Lupin] If that god comes
from the sky every 76 years,

01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:05,810
is his vessel by any chance a comet?

I've been sleeping here all this time.

1195

Every 76 years, I awaken
and wander the Earth,

for the Gold of Babylon.

Why don't we just take
it to the president?

1299
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:05,711
I'm certain that he'd give us both

1300

a big reward with lots of money

1301
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:10,549
and then I could go out
and buy a lotta wine!

1302
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:14,428
- No, because if we did that,
we'd be arrested for sure!

1303
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:15,930

- Right, whatever Zenigata does,

1311
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,790
he's a bumbling, block-headed nincompoop!

I can't stand it anymore!

(engines rumbling)

1320
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:02,393
- Over here, boys!
- We're here!

1321
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:04,520
- We need your help!
- Help us!

1322
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,730
- Come on!
- Help us!

1323
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:08,232
- Get them to share some
oil and water with us,

1324
01:07:08,232 --> 01:07:10,026
in a polite way, of course!

1325
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:12,319
- [Caramel] Don't worry,
we'll handle this.

1326
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:16,824
(Caramel chuckling)

(all moaning)

1329
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:28,044
- Hey, what in the hell do you think

1330
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,463
you're all trying to do here?

1331
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:33,049
Listen, you mustn't think
this is an act of war

1332
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,925
against the Kuwaiti Army or anything.

1333
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:36,761
- You can all walk home!

1334
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:37,595
- Hey!

1335
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:40,347
(engines rumbling)

1336
01:07:40,347 --> 01:07:41,849
Huh?

1337
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:42,683
What the?

1338
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:46,187
They're really nice once
you get to know them.

1339
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:47,438
Well, I gotta go.

1340
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:50,524
Hey, wait for me!

1341
01:07:50,524 --> 01:07:52,109
Hey! (grunting)

1342
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:52,943
Wait!

1343
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:54,820
- [Marciano] Give me the lion statue!

1344
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:57,573
If you resist, you will die!

1345

(fuses hissing)

1350
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:04,997
Eh?
- Huh?

1351
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:06,415
- Ah?
- Hm!

1352
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:07,249

(explosions booming)

1354
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:11,504

01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:12,338
(mirror snapping)

1356
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:13,672

(propellor clattering)

1365
01:08:34,735 --> 01:08:36,195
Take that! (laughing)

1366
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,446
Huh?

1367
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:38,280
What the?

1368

What the?
(vehicles clanking)

1376
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:02,847
What the hell?

(engine rumbling)

1384
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:38,674
The Kuwaiti Army's joining in!

1385
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:40,342
- [Jigen] Though I can't imagine why.

1386
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:41,844

(Lupin chuckling)

1392
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:58,777

(Lupin yelping)

1396
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:05,034
- [Lupin] Whoa!

1397
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,035
Whoa!

1398
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,077
Whoa!

(explosions booming)

1403
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:26,764
- I will make them pay for this.

1404
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,641
Turn around and charge into them.

1405
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:30,059
- Okay, you're on!

1406
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:34,480
(explosions booming)
(dramatic music)

1407
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,397
Okay, go!

1408
01:10:36,857 --> 01:10:41,570

(engine rumbling)

1410
01:10:44,698 --> 01:10:46,325
Did you just botch it, Goemon?

1411
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:48,535
- [Goemon] No, not at all.

1412
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:55,834
(Qing Xiao screaming)

1413
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:58,504
- Wow, that was too close, Goemon!

1414
01:10:58,504 --> 01:10:59,964
Nice job!

1415
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:02,174
- How the hell did you know
she was in there, Goemon?

1416
01:11:02,174 --> 01:11:05,219
- My Zantetsuken will not cut flowers.

1417
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:08,347
- Heh, I guess this is what they call

1418
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:09,723
mysteries of the orient.

1419
01:11:10,724 --> 01:11:12,685
- Hey, Lupin!
(Jigen yelping)

1420
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:14,937
Give yourself up quietly right now!

1421
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:17,564
I won't shoot, I promise I won't shoot!

1422
01:11:17,564 --> 01:11:20,943
So pull that jeep over right now or, ah!

1423
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:23,654
(explosion booming)

1424
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:26,573
Hey, Officer Zakskaya, don't shoot!

1425
01:11:26,573 --> 01:11:27,866
Did you hear me?

1426
01:11:27,866 --> 01:11:29,201
That's an order!

1427
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:32,746
(Zenigata grunting)

1428
01:11:32,746 --> 01:11:35,374
- Hey, has his throat been
torn out or something?

1429
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:37,626
- Has his head been twisted off?

1430
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:39,920
- Or maybe his ribs have been broken?

1431
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,047
(Zenigata groaning)

1432
01:11:42,047 --> 01:11:43,340
- You'll be quiet!

1433
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:46,135
(Zenigata groaning)

1434
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:46,969
Now go!

1435
01:11:47,928 --> 01:11:50,431
(Zenigata groaning)

1436
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:52,349
Sights aligned.

1437
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:53,517
Fire!

1438
01:11:53,517 --> 01:11:56,603
(explosions booming)

1439
01:12:02,901 --> 01:12:05,070
(wheels popping)

1440
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:08,032
(Lupin and Jigen grunting)

1441
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:11,076
(Lupin chuckling)

1442
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:13,912

(water splashing)

1446
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:25,591
- Ha, sorry, Pops, but this
little number is amphibious!

1447
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:26,550
- Oh yeah?

1448
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:29,261
Well, so is this tank!

1449
01:12:29,261 --> 01:12:31,347
Or at least it should be.

1450
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:33,724
Fire!

1451
01:12:33,724 --> 01:12:36,685
(explosion booming)

1452
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:39,021
(Zenigata growling)

1453
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,022
Damn you, Lupin!

1454
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:42,941
Hey!

1455
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:47,946
(gunshots booming)
(Zenigata grunting)

1456
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:52,034
Hey, uh, I thought this tank could float.

1457
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,619
I guess I was wrong (chuckling).

1458
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,039
Huh?

1459
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:57,873
What's this?

1460
01:12:57,873 --> 01:12:59,083
We mustn't despair!

1461
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:00,834
Faith, we gotta have faith!

1462
01:13:00,834 --> 01:13:01,794
We'll get him!

1463
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:04,338
Lupin!

1464
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:05,506
Get back here you!

1465
01:13:05,506 --> 01:13:07,925
I said come back in the name of the law!

1466
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:09,051
(Zenigata yelping)

1467
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:11,887
(water splashing)

1468
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:16,100
- Goemon!

1469
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:18,685
Please come back!

1470
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:25,818
(engine rumbling)

1471
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:26,652
- Huh?

1472
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:31,657
- Lupin!

1473
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:36,286
(Lupin growling)

1474
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:43,836
(fabric rustling)

1475
01:13:44,878 --> 01:13:46,171
(Lupin growling)

1476
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:47,673
- Huh?

1477
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:48,757
(Fujiko chuckling)

1478
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:50,092
(kiss smacking)

1479
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:52,010
Hey, Fujiko, get away from him!

1480
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:53,679
Don't wrap yourself around him!

1481
01:13:58,016 --> 01:13:59,810
- Looks she's hit on some big time

1482
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:01,728
Kuwaiti millionaire, Lupin.

1483
01:14:01,728 --> 01:14:04,064
I'm guessing she's gonna
travel all over the world

1484
01:14:04,064 --> 01:14:05,899
on that cruise ship with that millionaire

1485
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:08,026
and get the treasure
off her hands, you know?

1486
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:09,987
- Yeah, you're probably right.

1487
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:12,448
- Aren't you even annoyed at all, Lupin?

1488
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:13,907
- Not in the least!

1489
01:14:13,907 --> 01:14:16,326
You see, I'm certain that
Fujiko is, without a doubt,

1490
01:14:16,326 --> 01:14:18,745
going to stick her nose
into our next big job.

1491
01:14:18,745 --> 01:14:20,831
- Hm, what do you mean our next job?

1492
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:23,041
- I mean the continuation of this affair,

1493
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:25,210
the treasure of all of
Babylon couldn't really

1494
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:26,962
be something as small as that.

1495
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:30,549
You see, there's a much bigger
treasure waiting for us.

1496
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:31,925
- Huh?

1497
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:34,678
- It finally came to me in
a big flash where it is.

1498
01:14:34,678 --> 01:14:36,555
I'm not smart for nothing, you know?

1499
01:14:37,514 --> 01:14:39,099
- Huh? So where is it?

1500
01:14:39,099 --> 01:14:40,267
- New York!

1501
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:41,685
- New York?

1502
01:14:41,685 --> 01:14:44,438
(waves crashing)

1503
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:50,527
(water splashing)

1504
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:52,279
- Huh?
- Hm?

1505
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:53,864
Hey, what is that?

1506
01:15:05,125 --> 01:15:07,878
(crane clicking)

1507
01:15:16,094 --> 01:15:19,223
- Fujiko, suppose you
fulfill your promise.

1508
01:15:19,223 --> 01:15:20,849
- (gasping) Promise?

1509
01:15:21,975 --> 01:15:26,605
(gunshots thundering)
(Fujiko yelping)

1510
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:29,191
(water splashing)

1511
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:32,194
(boat horn blaring)

1512
01:15:47,459 --> 01:15:49,253
(Marciano chuckling)

1513
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:52,756
(mystical dramatic music)

1514
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:01,932
(computer ringing)

1515
01:16:01,932 --> 01:16:02,766
- Hm?

1516
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:11,525
(computer whirring)

1517
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,695
What is it?

1518
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:16,113
- [Kowalski] Lupin and his gang are back

1519
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:17,573
in New York City again.

1520
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:18,657
- What the?

1521
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:20,158
What are they doing here?

1522
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:21,660
- Isn't it obvious?

1523
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:23,704
They're gonna try to
take back to treasure.

1524
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:24,538
(phone ringing)

1525
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:25,372
Hm?

1526
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,417
- [Lupin] Hi there, Kowalski, guess who!

1527
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:30,419
That's right, it's me, Lupin!

1528
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:33,046
I'm sure you know by now that
I've come back to Manhattan,

1529
01:16:33,046 --> 01:16:34,506
but understand something.

1530
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:37,217
I'm not going to lay a finger
on your treasure, okay?

1531
01:16:37,217 --> 01:16:38,677
So you and your goons kindly

1532
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:40,637
stay away from us too, got that?

1533
01:16:40,637 --> 01:16:41,471
Capisce?

1534
01:16:41,471 --> 01:16:44,099
- Hm, prattle on while you can, Lupin.

1535
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:46,643
- Ha, what a dumbass!

1536
01:16:46,643 --> 01:16:48,270
- (groaning) Kill him.

1537
01:16:49,187 --> 01:16:50,022
Kill him!

1538
01:16:50,022 --> 01:16:51,607
Kill him, kill him!

1539
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,818
(Marciano sobbing)

1540
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:56,778
I won't give it up!

1541
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:59,156
I won't give it up to anyone!

1542
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:02,075
(Marciano sobbing)

1543
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:05,912
Mommy!

1544
01:17:05,912 --> 01:17:08,832
(Marciano sobbing)

1545
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:12,711
(Marciano sniffling)

1546
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:15,797
(Kowalski chuckling)

1547
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:24,765
- Junior said it three times.

1548
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:27,768
Kill him, kill him, kill him!
(gangsters groaning)

1549
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:29,186
Do as he says!

1550
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:30,395
- [Willy] We understand, boss!

1551
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:32,689
- [Kowalski] Mike, you
got anything to say?

1552
01:17:32,689 --> 01:17:35,484
- Uh, please spare me, sir?

1553
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:36,902
- [Kowalski] Is that all you got?

1554
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:39,946
- I beg you, please don't kill me!

1555
01:17:39,946 --> 01:17:41,865
- Twice you failed to kill Lupin.

1556
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:43,992
Your third failure was Daisuke Jigen!

1557
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:47,871
You got right next to him and
you couldn't finish him off!

1558
01:17:47,871 --> 01:17:49,748
(Mike whimpering)

1559
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:52,417
Don't move, there's a fly on your ass!

1560
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:54,002
(flyswatter smacking)
(Mike yelping)

1561
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:56,880
(tense grim music)

1562
01:18:02,803 --> 01:18:05,555
(all shuddering)

1563
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:12,813
Lose the body.

1564
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:15,774
(audience cheering)

1565
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:20,737
(boxers grunting)
(blows thudding)

1566
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:23,990
- Come on, man, you got this!

1567
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:25,117
Come on!

1568
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:29,579
(audience cheering)
(boxers grunting)

1569
01:18:29,579 --> 01:18:32,249
(blow thudding)

1570
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:37,003
- [Referee] One, two, three...

1571
01:18:37,003 --> 01:18:39,673
(pensive music)

1572
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:45,345
(subway rattling)

1573
01:18:45,345 --> 01:18:49,015
(water trickling)

1574
01:18:49,015 --> 01:18:54,020
(Jigen grunting)
(drill whirring)

1575
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:59,943
(rocks crashing)

1576
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:02,654
- [Jigen] Whoa!

1577
01:19:08,368 --> 01:19:10,912
(Lupin grunting)

1578
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:13,123
(Jigen grunting)

1579
01:19:13,123 --> 01:19:16,209
- Wow, this is one huge cavern down here!

1580
01:19:16,209 --> 01:19:19,212
(both grunting)

1581
01:19:19,212 --> 01:19:24,217
(drill whirring)
(Jigen grunting)

1582
01:19:29,306 --> 01:19:30,182
Huh?

1583
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:31,016
Ah!

1584
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:37,689
(Lupin chuckling)

1585
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:39,983
Hey, look, Jigen, these
are real gold ingots!

1586
01:19:39,983 --> 01:19:40,817
- Huh?

1587
01:19:40,817 --> 01:19:42,110
What the?

1588
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:43,779
(Lupin chuckling)

1589
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,447
- We've struck it rich!

1590
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:47,407
- Are you trying to tell me

1591
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:49,785
this is the Gold of Babylon, Lupin?

1592
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:52,496
(Lupin laughing)

1593
01:19:54,247 --> 01:19:56,833
Hey, are you all right?

1594
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:58,043
- Uh-huh.

1595
01:19:58,043 --> 01:20:00,587
- So how did you know this was it anyway?

1596
01:20:00,587 --> 01:20:01,421
- Elementary!

1597
01:20:01,421 --> 01:20:03,298
I noticed that the Manhattan inscriptions

1598
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:05,467
were distributed in a circular manner.

1599
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:08,303
So I thought if we dug at
the center of Manhattan,

1600
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:10,347
that something just might be found!

1601
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:15,352
(computer warbling)
(calm pensive music)

1602
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,484
You see, Jigen, I tried out the theory

1603
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,778
that the cuneiforms that
were engraved on their faces

1604
01:20:24,778 --> 01:20:27,906
went flying out just
like engraving plates.

1605
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:30,158
- Ah, I see.

1606
01:20:31,034 --> 01:20:33,912
(lighter clicking)

1607
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:35,705
(Jigen exhaling)

1608
01:20:35,705 --> 01:20:38,583
That solves the inverse
characters mystery.

1609
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:41,336
- The Golden Tower of Babel
was transported intact

1610
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:43,296
from the ruins of Babylon to right here

1611
01:20:43,296 --> 01:20:45,006
in the good old U.S. of A!

1612
01:20:46,216 --> 01:20:47,884
- Who transported it here?

1613
01:20:47,884 --> 01:20:50,011
- I have no idea!

1614
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:52,222
- How in the hell could
they possibly move it here

1615
01:20:52,222 --> 01:20:54,057
over 2,500 years ago?

1616
01:20:54,057 --> 01:20:55,475
- I don't know, I tell ya!

1617
01:20:55,475 --> 01:20:57,310
But, as I said to you earlier, Jigen,

1618
01:20:57,310 --> 01:20:59,062
whether it's aliens or it's gods,

1619
01:20:59,062 --> 01:21:02,357
those things that you hate
may very well show up.

1620
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:04,818
- (laughing) Now I really want a drink!

1621
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:09,114
(Lupin exhaling)

1622
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:10,866
- Time is running out, Jigen.

1623
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:11,658
- Time?

1624
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:14,744
- The aliens will be coming to
pick this gold up very soon.

1625
01:21:14,744 --> 01:21:15,579
- Huh?

1626
01:21:16,913 --> 01:21:18,331
What did you say?

1627
01:21:18,331 --> 01:21:20,625
- Actually, Old Lady Rosetta said it.

1628
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:22,836
Every 76 years you stand atop

1629
01:21:22,836 --> 01:21:25,130
the shining Tower of Babel, right?

1630
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:26,673
Isn't there a comet that passes

1631
01:21:26,673 --> 01:21:29,342
right by our planet every 76 years?

1632
01:21:29,342 --> 01:21:30,594
- Halley's Comet?

1633
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:32,137
- Mm-hmm!

1634
01:21:35,515 --> 01:21:38,435
According to the papers,
Halley's Comet comes closest

1635
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:41,813
to Earth at exactly 11
p.m. tomorrow night.

1636
01:21:41,813 --> 01:21:43,189
- [Jigen] 25 hours from now.

1637
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:49,321
(machinery whirring)
(gold ingots clanking)

1638
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:02,417
(water splashing)

1639
01:22:05,712 --> 01:22:07,797
Just thinking that all these bars

1640
01:22:07,797 --> 01:22:11,301
are all solid gold really depresses me.

1641
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:12,385
- [Lupin] You said it!

1642
01:22:12,385 --> 01:22:14,763
It all seems really stupid somehow.

1643
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:17,265
- [Jigen] Okay, that's
it, we've got plenty.

1644
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:19,017
- Two boats full, huh?

1645
01:22:19,017 --> 01:22:20,810
- Yeah, and I don't know about you,

1646
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:23,271
but I could really go
for a drink right now.

1647
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:24,105
(Lupin snapping)

1648
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:25,857
- Don't mind if I do!

1649
01:22:25,857 --> 01:22:28,944
(machinery whirring)

1650
01:22:32,072 --> 01:22:35,408
(energetic funky music)

1651
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:45,126
Hey Sam, long time, no see.

1652
01:22:46,086 --> 01:22:47,337
- [Sam] Hey.

1653
01:22:47,337 --> 01:22:48,880
No, no...

1654
01:22:49,756 --> 01:22:50,590
- Huh?

1655
01:22:53,176 --> 01:22:54,177
(gunshot booming)

1656
01:22:54,177 --> 01:22:59,182
(gangsters groaning)
(gunshots thundering)

1657
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:00,642
- Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap,

1658
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:02,560
crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap!

1659
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:05,480
(both grunting)

1660
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,940
(Goemon grunting)
(gunshots booming)

1661
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:09,192
(gangsters yelping)

1662
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:10,193
- [Goemon Voiceover] Have I once again

1663
01:23:10,193 --> 01:23:11,778
cut something worthless?

1664
01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:12,612
(Willy whimpering)

1665
01:23:12,612 --> 01:23:14,072
- [Willy Voiceover] At
least I still have my hair!

1666
01:23:14,072 --> 01:23:15,115
Crap!

1667
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:18,284
(gunshots thundering)

1668
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:21,913
- Should you really be
at a place like this?

1669
01:23:21,913 --> 01:23:23,832
The 76th year is tomorrow!

1670
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:26,209
(gunshots thundering)

1671
01:23:26,209 --> 01:23:29,921
- You know by now, don't
you, where the tower is?

1672
01:23:29,921 --> 01:23:32,882
- It's, uh, under Madison Square Garden.

1673
01:23:32,882 --> 01:23:36,886
(gunshots thundering)

1674
01:23:36,886 --> 01:23:38,638
- I see, thanks, Lupin.

1675
01:23:38,638 --> 01:23:41,766
(gunshots thundering)

1676
01:23:41,766 --> 01:23:45,228
Fujiko has been captured, they're
holding her at Marciano's.

1677
01:23:45,228 --> 01:23:46,521
- They have Fujiko?

1678
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:50,233
(tense dramatic music)

1679
01:23:50,233 --> 01:23:51,901
Hey, take care of this for me!

1680
01:23:51,901 --> 01:23:53,111
(gunshots thundering)

1681
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:55,655
Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap!

1682
01:23:55,655 --> 01:24:00,618
(engine revving)
(energetic funky music)

1683
01:24:14,549 --> 01:24:17,469
(glass shattering)

1684
01:24:23,099 --> 01:24:24,809
(brakes squeaking)

1685
01:24:24,809 --> 01:24:26,102
Fujiko!

1686
01:24:26,102 --> 01:24:26,936
Fujiko!

1687
01:24:28,688 --> 01:24:31,441
(engine revving)

1688
01:24:34,861 --> 01:24:35,695
(tape recorder clicking)

1689
01:24:35,695 --> 01:24:37,781
- [Marciano] Open Sesame.

1690
01:24:39,574 --> 01:24:42,577
(elevator whirring)

1691
01:24:50,543 --> 01:24:51,377
What the?

1692
01:24:59,552 --> 01:25:01,638
- We've been waiting for you, Lupin.

1693
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:04,015
(Marciano laughing)

1694
01:25:04,015 --> 01:25:06,309
(Lupin growling)

1695
01:25:06,309 --> 01:25:08,645
- Drop the gun, or else!

1696
01:25:08,645 --> 01:25:10,814
- You see this box I'm holding?

1697
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:12,732
Well, this is a very powerful bomb.

1698
01:25:12,732 --> 01:25:14,359
If I squeeze it just a little bit,

1699
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:17,487
everything within 100
meters will blow sky high!

1700
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:18,905
- Enough bluffing!

1701
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:20,365
I know all about your tricks.

1702
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:22,367
When it comes to Fujiko,
you won't do anything

1703
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:24,452
that will endanger her, now will you?

1704
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:31,334
(gun clattering)

1705
01:25:31,334 --> 01:25:34,087
(box clattering)

1706
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:36,381
Hm!

1707
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:38,508
(liquid trickling)

1708
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:41,719
Today's the end of the
Marciano organization.

1709
01:25:41,719 --> 01:25:42,720
- [Marciano] Huh?

1710
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:43,596
Uh...

1711
01:25:43,596 --> 01:25:46,432
- As of today, I'm the boss of Manhattan!

1712
01:25:46,432 --> 01:25:49,686
(flyswatter smacking)
(Marciano yelping)

1713
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:52,605
(Marciano gagging)

1714
01:26:07,328 --> 01:26:09,289
See, I designed this entire building

1715
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:11,082
together with his father, but I know

1716
01:26:11,082 --> 01:26:13,209
of a much more interesting place, Lupin.

1717
01:26:14,085 --> 01:26:18,047
Let me show it to you, it'll
be the last thing you ever see.

1718
01:26:18,047 --> 01:26:20,466
(tense grim music)

1719
01:26:20,466 --> 01:26:21,885
- I'm so sorry.

1720
01:26:21,885 --> 01:26:24,554
(water roaring)

1721
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:38,693
(Kowalski chuckling)

1722
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:43,573
(Kowalski grunting)

1723
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:46,826
- Down below, a black river runs

1724
01:26:46,826 --> 01:26:49,621
through the lowest level
of Manhattan's bedrock.

1725
01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:52,498
Now you and Fujiko will join
all the other dirty rats

1726
01:26:52,498 --> 01:26:54,542
that have been bumped off here.

1727
01:26:54,542 --> 01:26:56,085
(Fujiko screaming)

1728
01:26:56,085 --> 01:26:58,087
(rope creaking)

1729
01:26:58,087 --> 01:27:01,507
(both screaming)
(grim dramatic music)

1730
01:27:01,507 --> 01:27:03,968
(water roaring)

1731
01:27:03,968 --> 01:27:06,721
(Lupin grunting)

1732
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:14,229
(Lupin yelping)

1733
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:16,648
(Lupin panting)

1734
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:20,193
(slaps smacking)
(Fujiko groaning)

1735
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:22,862
(Lupin yelping)

1736
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:27,116
(Lupin panting)

1737
01:27:27,116 --> 01:27:29,786
(both grunting)

1738
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:35,208
- Where are we?

1739
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:37,126
- Inside the Tower of Babel!

1740
01:27:37,126 --> 01:27:39,462
The Golden Tower of Babel, that is.

1741
01:27:39,462 --> 01:27:42,131
(water roaring)

1742
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:48,304
(both grunting)

1743
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,809
This is a view you don't
get to see very often.

1744
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:55,228
That old lady Rosetta is smart too,

1745
01:27:55,228 --> 01:27:56,896
she's probably already there.

1746
01:27:56,896 --> 01:27:59,732
(water splashing)

1747
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:02,944
- I really have no idea
what you're talking about.

1748
01:28:02,944 --> 01:28:04,195
(both yelping)

1749
01:28:04,195 --> 01:28:06,698
(both grunting)

1750
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:08,825
Will you explain it to me, Lupin?

1751
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:13,413
- Well, legend has it
that once upon a time,

1752
01:28:13,413 --> 01:28:17,041
way back in ancient days,
God collected all the gold

1753
01:28:17,041 --> 01:28:22,046
in Babylonia and had the
humans make it into a tower.

1754
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:24,382
Then God riding down upon a comet

1755
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:27,427
and took that tower into the sky!

1756
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:30,722
However, for some unexplained
reason, along the way

1757
01:28:30,722 --> 01:28:33,016
God dropped the golden tower and it fell

1758
01:28:33,016 --> 01:28:36,227
all the way down to Earth
onto an uninhabited land,

1759
01:28:36,227 --> 01:28:38,563
which would become America.

1760
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:40,732
And several thousands of years later,

1761
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:42,692
many people lived and loved here

1762
01:28:42,692 --> 01:28:45,445
and it became a town
known as New York City.

1763
01:28:45,445 --> 01:28:48,489
And that's the story of
the Golden Tower of Babel.

1764
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:51,284
- This is the Tower of Babel?

1765
01:28:51,284 --> 01:28:53,077
(Fujiko laughing)
(Lupin grunting)

1766
01:28:53,077 --> 01:28:53,911
So weird!

1767
01:28:55,913 --> 01:28:58,791
I don't understand, why
did God steal all the gold?

1768
01:28:58,791 --> 01:29:00,001
- He likes it!

1769
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,544
- What would He use it for?

1770
01:29:01,544 --> 01:29:04,005
- He'd use it for money, don't you think?

1771
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:05,006
- He what?

1772
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:06,924
You think God uses money too?

1773
01:29:06,924 --> 01:29:08,259
- I'm sure He does.

1774
01:29:08,259 --> 01:29:09,802
- What does He use it for?

1775
01:29:09,802 --> 01:29:11,512
- To buy the things He wants!

1776
01:29:13,306 --> 01:29:15,683
- What does He do with the things He buys?

1777
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:17,060
- He gobbles them up!

1778
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:17,977
(Lupin kissing)

1779
01:29:17,977 --> 01:29:19,562
(Fujiko yelping)
(Lupin grunting)

1780
01:29:19,562 --> 01:29:21,397
(water splashing)

1781
01:29:21,397 --> 01:29:24,150
(Lupin grunting)

1782
01:29:26,819 --> 01:29:28,571
- (yelping) Save me!

1783
01:29:28,571 --> 01:29:29,614
Lupin!

1784
01:29:29,614 --> 01:29:32,658
(Lupin grunting)

1785
01:29:32,658 --> 01:29:35,411
(Fujiko yelping)

1786
01:29:35,411 --> 01:29:39,540
(Fujiko yelping)
(Lupin grunting)

1787
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,125
(Lupin yelping)

1788
01:29:41,125 --> 01:29:43,878
(Lupin grunting)

1789
01:29:45,004 --> 01:29:45,838
(Fujiko yelping)

1790
01:29:45,838 --> 01:29:49,342
(Lupin yelping)

1791
01:29:49,342 --> 01:29:51,511
(Lupin yelping)

1792
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:54,180
(Lupin yelping)

1793
01:29:58,434 --> 01:30:01,270
(Lupin screaming)

1794
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:07,735
- [Lupin] Crap, crap, crap!

1795
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:09,612
Sorry for going ahead of you!

1796
01:30:09,612 --> 01:30:12,657
(water roaring)

1797
01:30:12,657 --> 01:30:15,660
(Lupin yelping)
(Fujiko panting)

1798
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:19,122
(both grunting)

1799
01:30:19,122 --> 01:30:21,082
(Lupin chuckling)
(Fujiko gasping)

1800
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:21,916
(Fujiko yelping)

1801
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:24,752
(water whooshing)

1802
01:30:30,216 --> 01:30:31,551
- [Kowalski] Hm.

1803
01:30:33,052 --> 01:30:34,178
Huh?

1804
01:30:34,178 --> 01:30:35,012
Hm.

1805
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:37,348
Hm.

1806
01:30:39,308 --> 01:30:42,812
(Kowalski yelping)

1807
01:30:42,812 --> 01:30:45,815
(explosion booming)

1808
01:30:51,988 --> 01:30:53,489
- Hey, are you okay?

1809
01:30:53,489 --> 01:30:56,200
Are you doing all right
there, sweet Fuji-cakes?

1810
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,202
- How do you think they're
going to move it all?

1811
01:30:58,202 --> 01:31:00,663
- Hm?
- The Gold of Babylon?

1812
01:31:00,663 --> 01:31:01,581
- Why don't we think about it

1813
01:31:01,581 --> 01:31:03,374
while we look up at the stars, huh?

1814
01:31:03,374 --> 01:31:04,750
(Lupin groaning)

1815
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:07,503
(yo-yo whirring)

1816
01:31:11,924 --> 01:31:14,677

(tower booming)

1829
01:32:31,754 --> 01:32:35,007
- This god is an alien, that
makes way more sense now!

1830
01:32:35,007 --> 01:32:36,217
- [Lupin] Uh-huh!

1831
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:39,136
- The Golden Tower of
Babel is going to the sky.

1832
01:32:39,136 --> 01:32:40,888
What a waste!

1833
01:32:40,888 --> 01:32:41,722
- [Goemon] Incredible!

1834
01:32:41,722 --> 01:32:44,016
- Are you just gonna
watch it go away, Lupin?

1835
01:32:44,016 --> 01:32:45,351
Stop, thief!

1836
01:32:47,728 --> 01:32:48,688
- What'd you say?

1837
01:32:48,688 --> 01:32:52,024
Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's?

1838
01:32:52,024 --> 01:32:55,695
- Yes, it belongs to
humans, it belongs to me!

1839
01:32:57,113 --> 01:32:59,782
(Lupin panting)

1840
01:33:01,284 --> 01:33:04,036
(Lupin grunting)

1841
01:33:06,289 --> 01:33:07,873

01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:13,671

(energy whirring)

1850
01:33:43,659 --> 01:33:45,453

(energy whirring)

1852
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:53,461
(mystical music)

1853
01:33:56,088 --> 01:33:57,923
- [Lupin] Ah!

1854
01:33:57,923 --> 01:33:59,467
- Thank you, Lupin.

1855
01:33:59,467 --> 01:34:01,135
I really am an alien.

1856
01:34:01,135 --> 01:34:03,763
Some even call me a goddess.

1857
01:34:03,763 --> 01:34:06,474
I was sent many Earth
years ago to your planet

1858
01:34:06,474 --> 01:34:08,768
to search for the lost Tower of Babel.

1859
01:34:10,436 --> 01:34:13,856
Only once every 76 years do
I have a chance to go back.

1860
01:34:13,856 --> 01:34:16,609
It's been a long time, I
look forward to returning.

1861
01:34:16,609 --> 01:34:18,736
- So you just used me to find

1862
01:34:18,736 --> 01:34:20,196
this thing for you, didn't you?

1863
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:21,364
- Yes, that is correct.

1864
01:34:21,364 --> 01:34:24,325
What Alexander the Great,
Napoleon, or even Hitler

1865
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:25,993
weren't able to do you have done.

1866
01:34:25,993 --> 01:34:28,037
You are truly a remarkable earthling.

1867
01:34:28,037 --> 01:34:28,913
Thank you, Lupin.

1868
01:34:30,414 --> 01:34:31,916
- This belongs to Earth.

1869
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:35,086
I'm not just gonna give
it up to you people!

1870
01:34:35,086 --> 01:34:37,296
- I really do love you, Lupin.

1871
01:34:39,965 --> 01:34:42,635
It would have been better if I didn't.

1872
01:34:42,635 --> 01:34:45,638
It is my true destiny
to return to my planet.

1873
01:34:48,974 --> 01:34:50,226
Goodbye, Lupin.

1874
01:34:50,226 --> 01:34:51,519
Goodbye, my love.

1875
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:54,855
(somber mystical music)

1876
01:35:12,331 --> 01:35:14,750
- It would be quite
interesting to accompany her

1877
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:16,377
to the ends of the universe.

1878
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:17,294
- Oh no!
- Hm?

1879
01:35:18,587 --> 01:35:20,965
(energy whooshing)

1880

(mystical music)

1894
01:36:54,391 --> 01:36:55,226
- Ah!

1895
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:05,361
And so we should render unto
Caesar that which is Caesar's

1896
01:37:05,361 --> 01:37:07,530
and that which belongs to the Earth.

1897
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:08,656
- Lupin?

1898
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:11,534
- What is it, Fuji-cakes, my love, hm?

1899
01:37:11,534 --> 01:37:12,576
- You dummy!

1900
01:37:12,576 --> 01:37:13,452
(Lupin chuckling)

01:37:13,452 --> 01:37:14,537
(plane whirring)

1902
01:37:14,537 --> 01:37:18,332
- (laughing) You can't
escape me this time, Lupin!

1903
01:37:18,332 --> 01:37:20,292
(Zenigata laughing)

1904
01:37:20,292 --> 01:37:22,336
Oh, I've got you now, Lupin,

1905
01:37:22,336 --> 01:37:24,797
and nothing you can do can stop me!

1906
01:37:24,797 --> 01:37:25,673
(belt whooshing)

1907
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:26,799
(Zenigata gasping)

1908
01:37:26,799 --> 01:37:27,633

(Zenigata yelping)

1910
01:37:28,884 --> 01:37:30,302
Wait, wait, wait!

1911
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:35,599
- Catch you later, Pops,
thanks for dropping by!

1912
01:37:35,599 --> 01:37:37,893
Toodles!
(Fujiko laughing)

(calm gentle music)

1914
01:37:43,816 --> 01:37:47,027
- Are you all here just waiting for Lupin?

1915
01:37:47,027 --> 01:37:50,447
- [All] No, we're waiting
for that idiot Zenigata!

1916
01:37:50,447 --> 01:37:53,868
- Come on! (mumbling)

1917
01:37:53,868 --> 01:37:56,745
- Oh no, the Tower of
Babel has fallen apart!

1918
01:37:56,745 --> 01:37:59,081
- Don't worry, we'll just have Rosetta

1919
01:37:59,081 --> 01:38:00,666
search for it again, right?

1920
01:38:00,666 --> 01:38:03,752
- I can't wait 76 years, Lupin.

1921
01:38:03,752 --> 01:38:06,630
I guess I'll just have to bet on you!
