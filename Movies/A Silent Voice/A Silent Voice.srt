1
00:01:08,325 --> 00:01:10,458
Thank you so much for everything, sir.

2
00:01:11,756 --> 00:01:14,703
For all of this, how does thirty thousand sound?

3
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:19,148
I wanna close out the account.

4
00:01:46,635 --> 00:01:47,579
Uh.

5
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,960
Everyone, take your seats.

6
00:03:56,985 --> 00:03:57,406
Huh?

7
00:03:58,861 --> 00:04:01,430
We have a new student that'll be joining our class today.

8
00:04:07,053 --> 00:04:08,280
What do you want?

9
00:04:08,743 --> 00:04:11,265
You're in luck, Shoya. I heard it's a girl.

10
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,752
So what?

11
00:04:12,777 --> 00:04:14,365
Like I care.

12
00:04:28,388 --> 00:04:30,939
Okay, class. This is Shoko.

13
00:04:31,514 --> 00:04:33,026
Would you like to introduce yourself?

14
00:04:41,811 --> 00:04:42,634
Hmm?

15
00:04:43,924 --> 00:04:44,347
Uh.

16
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,587
Holy crap!

17
00:05:41,468 --> 00:05:43,328
Hi, nice to meet you.

18
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:46,024
Yoo-hoo! Hey there, new girl.

19
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,930
Do you know how to speak Japanese?

20
00:05:47,955 --> 00:05:49,254
Come on, Naoka.

21
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,880
That's not very nice.

22
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:53,960
Oh, uh, I...

23
00:05:56,652 --> 00:05:57,557
Ah.

24
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:03,013
Do you have a nickname?

25
00:06:03,057 --> 00:06:04,599
How do you like that?

26
00:06:04,624 --> 00:06:05,860
Come on, take it!

27
00:06:06,072 --> 00:06:07,615
Your nickname is Sho?

28
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,055
Huh?

29
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,546
Oh, just like Shoya.

30
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,856
Hey, we have another Sho now.

31
00:06:11,881 --> 00:06:13,208
Two Shos is pretty cool.

32
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:15,628
What? No, it's not!

33
00:06:15,653 --> 00:06:17,380
I'm gonna pants you!

34
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,814
Alright, make sure to write this down.

35
00:06:22,878 --> 00:06:27,061
The exercises are on page 20-25 and on page 32.

36
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:30,391
All of this will be on your next quiz.

37
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,716
Give me your notebook, okay?

38
00:06:36,152 --> 00:06:37,501
Look at the diagram.

39
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,378
At the center is the fulcrum.

40
00:06:39,811 --> 00:06:40,131
Mm.

41
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:43,276
The fulcrum is both the point of
rest and the support for the lever.

42
00:06:43,585 --> 00:06:45,338
It is the crux of any motion.

43
00:06:45,865 --> 00:06:50,780
The placement of the fulcrum determines how
far the levered object will move, which forces...

44
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,044
Not yet, Shoko.

45
00:07:13,327 --> 00:07:13,681
Huh?

46
00:07:13,877 --> 00:07:16,136
You... you're coming in too early.

47
00:07:16,777 --> 00:07:18,093
Watch me, okay?

48
00:07:18,184 --> 00:07:20,186
Don't start singing till I start.

49
00:07:22,906 --> 00:07:24,631
O-okay, from the top.

50
00:07:28,596 --> 00:07:31,029
Guess we won't be winning the choir contest.

51
00:07:31,054 --> 00:07:31,504
Hm?

52
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:32,889
You can say that again.

53
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,225
And this is for acting like a moron!

54
00:07:36,407 --> 00:07:38,073
Okay, go easy on me!

55
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,782
Alright, I surrender!

56
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:41,333
I'm so sick of this.

57
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,300
He talks so fast. I can't write everything down.

58
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:46,657
Well, I can give you my notes if you want.

59
00:07:46,788 --> 00:07:48,137
You're a lifesaver.

60
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:48,701
Hm?

61
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:49,199
Huh?

62
00:07:50,922 --> 00:07:52,949
But I didn't do anything wrong,

63
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,947
and so I will never say I'm sorry.

64
00:07:54,972 --> 00:07:56,450
Why are you reading so slow?

65
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:58,010
You sound like you're five.

66
00:07:58,837 --> 00:08:01,427
Fine, enough of that. Who's next?

67
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:02,533
Four-eyes.

68
00:08:02,891 --> 00:08:03,455
Shoko.

69
00:08:04,053 --> 00:08:04,413
Mm.

70
00:08:07,174 --> 00:08:08,620
Start reading from here.

71
00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:11,415
There was an awkward silence.

72
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,610
His mother looked at him and waited.

73
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,580
She shook her head and said,

74
00:08:15,605 --> 00:08:19,024
You need to stop being so stubborn all the time.

75
00:08:19,342 --> 00:08:22,258
"'You have no intention of apologizing.'"

76
00:08:22,355 --> 00:08:24,932
That's good. Shoya, you're next.

77
00:08:26,154 --> 00:08:27,610
You gotta be kidding.

78
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,408
That isn't funny. Sit down, Shoya.

79
00:08:38,646 --> 00:08:40,649
Okay.

80
00:08:44,555 --> 00:08:46,062
Can you believe it?

81
00:08:50,817 --> 00:08:52,949
Uh, no thanks.

82
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,065
Yeah, let's go.

83
00:09:16,357 --> 00:09:18,180
Uh, we're leaving, Shoko.

84
00:09:52,835 --> 00:09:53,978
You know something?

85
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:57,002
We're all sick of you and your notebook.

86
00:09:57,275 --> 00:09:59,827
It's getting pretty old pretty fast.

87
00:10:01,754 --> 00:10:03,042
What do you want?

88
00:10:07,355 --> 00:10:08,927
Can we be friends?

89
00:10:10,018 --> 00:10:10,735
Uh.

90
00:10:12,316 --> 00:10:13,130
What?

91
00:10:14,422 --> 00:10:16,028
You're such a freak!

92
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:30,210
Good morning, everyone. I'm Miss Kita, the DHH liason.

93
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,585
Do you all know what sign language is?

94
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:33,791
Okay.

95
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:35,495
It's kind of like

96
00:10:35,597 --> 00:10:38,667
using your hands to talk instead of your voice.

97
00:10:38,691 --> 00:10:39,820
Isn't that neat?

98
00:10:40,768 --> 00:10:41,819
Alright then.

99
00:10:41,843 --> 00:10:42,352
Sign, huh?

100
00:10:42,377 --> 00:10:45,518
Since we wanna make it easier to communicate with Shoko,

101
00:10:45,637 --> 00:10:49,973
every single morning, we're going to
spend three minutes of class learning to sign.

102
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:53,978
Miss Kita.

103
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,018
Yes?

104
00:10:55,341 --> 00:10:57,665
Why can't we just write in her notebook?

105
00:10:58,893 --> 00:11:03,093
It would be easier for Shoko if everyone
just learned a little sign language.

106
00:11:03,201 --> 00:11:03,880
Yeah?

107
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:08,126
Well, it would be easier for me
if I could just write stuff down.

108
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,732
'Scuse me.

109
00:11:11,828 --> 00:11:14,219
I'll do it. I can learn how to sign.

110
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:23,058
So, your name...

111
00:11:23,811 --> 00:11:26,647
Mi-yo-ko.

112
00:11:26,756 --> 00:11:28,762
Whoa, so it's...

113
00:11:28,869 --> 00:11:29,512
Mi-yo-ko?

114
00:11:29,536 --> 00:11:31,389
Goody-two-shoes loser.

115
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:34,276
He's so cool.

116
00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:36,366
Oh, my gosh, mine too!

117
00:11:36,408 --> 00:11:38,062
Hey, he'll be on the show next week.

118
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:39,714
Let's watch it together.

119
00:11:40,322 --> 00:11:42,509
Gross, did she get dressed in the dark?

120
00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:44,857
I can't believe you said that.

121
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:47,881
So based on the author's previous work...

122
00:11:47,922 --> 00:11:50,364
By looking at the results of the experiment...

123
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,899
Keisuke, you draw over there.

124
00:11:59,434 --> 00:12:02,080
Shoko is a...

125
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:04,421
What do you think you're doing?

126
00:12:04,446 --> 00:12:06,148
You really shouldn't do that.

127
00:12:06,177 --> 00:12:07,806
Almost done...

128
00:12:07,831 --> 00:12:09,901
Don't you think you're going a bit too far?

129
00:12:09,947 --> 00:12:12,472
Nope, but I can go even further.

130
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:14,894
You can be such a jerk.

131
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:15,639
Come on!

132
00:12:15,664 --> 00:12:17,286
I'm not that bad.

133
00:12:17,744 --> 00:12:19,949
Check out my masterpiece.

134
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:21,279
Hm?

135
00:12:29,723 --> 00:12:32,769
Oh, my gosh! Who would write such a thing?

136
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:34,313
Some people!

137
00:12:34,848 --> 00:12:37,459
Here, I'll just erase that for you

138
00:12:37,484 --> 00:12:39,805
so you don't have to see it.

139
00:12:40,908 --> 00:12:43,824
There, no need to thank me.

140
00:13:02,518 --> 00:13:04,378
I said no need to thank me.

141
00:13:05,193 --> 00:13:06,604
Let's go, guys.

142
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:11,407
During the Jomon period...

143
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:14,951
Huh?

144
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:18,756
Cut it out, Shoya.

145
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:20,852
Or would you rather have detention?

146
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:22,863
No, sir. Sorry.

147
00:13:24,507 --> 00:13:26,726
Okay, where did I leave off?

148
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:27,739
Right.

149
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:31,020
The typical Jomon house was a pit dwelling with a...

150
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:32,884
That was startling, wasn't it?

151
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,246
Hey. Hey, Shoko.

152
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:41,218
What do we have here?

153
00:13:41,302 --> 00:13:43,184
Does that mean you can actually hear?

154
00:13:43,231 --> 00:13:46,298
Oh, you know what? I was wondering the same thing.

155
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:47,543
Can I see 'em for a sec?

156
00:13:50,653 --> 00:13:51,611
Naoka!

157
00:13:52,196 --> 00:13:54,856
What are those things? Toss 'em over!

158
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:01,075
Is that earwax?

159
00:14:01,118 --> 00:14:03,231
That is so gross!

160
00:14:22,705 --> 00:14:23,120
Huh?

161
00:14:23,745 --> 00:14:25,382
Shoko, are you okay?

162
00:14:27,206 --> 00:14:29,350
Oh, no she's bleeding!

163
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,223
What do we do?

164
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,403
You went too far, man.

165
00:14:36,123 --> 00:14:38,656
Mr. Four-Eyes is such an asshole.

166
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:43,071
Oh, great. Now what?

167
00:14:43,896 --> 00:14:45,408
You're in our way.

168
00:14:46,507 --> 00:14:47,929
What is she even doing?

169
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:49,843
Get lost.

170
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,461
Sorry?

171
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,443
You're not sorry, you're just pathetic!

172
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:02,525
Hey, what are you doing? Stop touching me!

173
00:15:03,151 --> 00:15:04,100
Check it out.

174
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,854
I think she wants to hold your hand.

175
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,750
You like it. You're blushing.

176
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,956
No, I'm not!

177
00:15:22,915 --> 00:15:24,662
Come on, let's go.

178
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:29,412
Huh?

179
00:15:30,144 --> 00:15:32,794
Oh, my god. Talk about crazy.

180
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:34,599
Ew, that water is gross!

181
00:15:34,624 --> 00:15:35,597
Yeah.

182
00:15:43,046 --> 00:15:45,221
We'll see you tomorrow, Shoya.

183
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:46,119
Later.

184
00:15:59,794 --> 00:16:01,456
Listen up, everyone.

185
00:16:01,484 --> 00:16:04,617
There's something very important
I'd like to talk to you about.

186
00:16:04,888 --> 00:16:08,045
As you can see, Shoko Nishimiya is absent today.

187
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:13,602
Yesterday, the school received a
telephone call from Shoko's mother.

188
00:16:14,008 --> 00:16:19,213
In the past five months, eight of Shoko's
hearing aids have been broken or gone missing.

189
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:21,924
Hearing aids are very expensive.

190
00:16:22,412 --> 00:16:25,243
Her mother believes Shoko is being bullied.

191
00:16:27,961 --> 00:16:31,694
If any of you have seen Shoko
being harassed or abused at school,

192
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:36,259
I need you to come forward and
tell us who has been doing it.

193
00:16:36,726 --> 00:16:38,538
If no one comes forward,

194
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:41,753
I'd hate to have to bring your parents into this.

195
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,406
This is a very serious matter,

196
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:51,513
and the school does not take bullying lightly.

197
00:16:51,538 --> 00:16:52,546
Shoya.

198
00:16:54,766 --> 00:16:55,653
Stand up.

199
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:57,313
We all know that it's you.

200
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,740
I told you to stand up!

201
00:17:00,907 --> 00:17:01,646
Yes, sir.

202
00:17:02,539 --> 00:17:03,971
Now then, Naoka.

203
00:17:04,044 --> 00:17:06,359
You sit right next to him. What have you seen?

204
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,455
Well, uh... It's kinda true.

205
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,222
He does tease her a little.

206
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,644
Like, he makes fun of her.

207
00:17:12,668 --> 00:17:13,164
What?

208
00:17:13,715 --> 00:17:14,783
And Kazuki?

209
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:16,652
Yeah, totally.

210
00:17:16,923 --> 00:17:18,707
I kept telling him to knock it off,

211
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:21,270
but Shoya won't listen to anyone.

212
00:17:21,424 --> 00:17:23,600
What? Wait!

213
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,045
Th-that's not fair!

214
00:17:25,173 --> 00:17:27,469
Y-you were making fun of her too, Kazuki!

215
00:17:28,456 --> 00:17:31,479
And it's not just the boys. The girls were doing it too.

216
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,686
I swear.

217
00:17:32,978 --> 00:17:34,119
It's true,

218
00:17:34,273 --> 00:17:35,982
especially Naoka and Miki!

219
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,640
That's mean.

220
00:17:39,322 --> 00:17:41,922
I would never do anything like that.

221
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:43,396
How could you?

222
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:46,321
How could you say something like that?

223
00:17:48,786 --> 00:17:50,075
No, I-I...

224
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:05,876
What the...?

225
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,863
Yes, I see.

226
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,623
I'm very sorry for any trouble he caused.

227
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:26,892
Yes, of course.

228
00:18:27,227 --> 00:18:29,229
Thank you. Goodbye.

229
00:18:31,893 --> 00:18:35,474
Shoya! Come back here, I'm talking to you.

230
00:18:36,189 --> 00:18:37,221
Shoya!

231
00:18:37,864 --> 00:18:39,979
I just got off the phone with the school.

232
00:18:40,403 --> 00:18:41,706
W-wait a minute.

233
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:43,538
Why are you so wet?

234
00:18:43,601 --> 00:18:44,743
Leave me alone.

235
00:18:44,854 --> 00:18:46,726
I jumped in the river like always.

236
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:47,693
Freeze, mister!

237
00:18:48,064 --> 00:18:49,954
Have you been causing trouble at school?

238
00:18:50,152 --> 00:18:51,354
I wouldn't, Mom.

239
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:55,217
Then why did I get a call from
your teacher this afternoon?

240
00:18:55,472 --> 00:18:57,472
Okay, fine, it's true!

241
00:18:58,825 --> 00:18:59,365
Huh?

242
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,362
Get cleaned up.

243
00:19:01,644 --> 00:19:04,038
We are going over to Shoko's right now.

244
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:12,444
Uh.

245
00:19:24,678 --> 00:19:25,323
Hm.

246
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:05,931
Uh.

247
00:20:10,902 --> 00:20:13,285
Come on, Sho. Let's go home.

248
00:20:13,782 --> 00:20:16,408
You're gonna try to be nicer from now on.

249
00:20:16,885 --> 00:20:17,701
' Kay?

250
00:20:20,783 --> 00:20:21,549
Huh?

251
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:26,401
All of these so-called great men
were going through their own struggles.

252
00:20:48,177 --> 00:20:49,048
Huh?

253
00:20:49,718 --> 00:20:52,515
Hey, what the heck is she doing?

254
00:20:53,343 --> 00:20:56,825
Hey, what are you doing at my desk?

255
00:21:01,924 --> 00:21:04,703
Don't you dare touch my stuff, you freak!

256
00:21:10,265 --> 00:21:11,562
There's that look again.

257
00:21:12,586 --> 00:21:15,154
Don't try to act all sweet and innocent!

258
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,820
What is it?

259
00:21:17,845 --> 00:21:20,323
If you wanna say something, then spit it out!

260
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,706
All you do is just stand there
with that stupid look on your face.

261
00:21:23,731 --> 00:21:25,059
Don't you ever get mad?

262
00:21:25,097 --> 00:21:27,861
Well? Then do something!

263
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:31,513
What the hell is wrong with you?

264
00:21:31,538 --> 00:21:33,661
I can't believe you bit me!

265
00:21:43,477 --> 00:21:45,528
I'm mad at you!

266
00:21:46,995 --> 00:21:49,745
I'm doing the best I can!

267
00:21:50,293 --> 00:21:52,389
What are you even saying?

268
00:21:56,503 --> 00:21:57,505
Get off!

269
00:21:57,621 --> 00:21:59,886
I can't even understand you!

270
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:31,371
I hate her. She's so weird.

271
00:22:32,121 --> 00:22:35,725
Shoko Nishimiya has transferred to another school.

272
00:22:36,786 --> 00:22:38,042
Moving on.

273
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:41,652
Now, who was in charge of the class journal yesterday?

274
00:22:41,897 --> 00:22:44,420
Well, whoever it was forgot to hand it in.

275
00:22:45,044 --> 00:22:47,968
Will everyone just check their
bags to see if they have it?

276
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:25,208
Oh, look, it's Shoko. How are you doin'?

277
00:23:35,016 --> 00:23:36,267
Shoko.

278
00:23:42,438 --> 00:23:45,248
Uh, hello. Do you remember me?

279
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:47,526
We were in elementary school together.

280
00:23:47,557 --> 00:23:49,363
I'm Shoya Ishida.

281
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,097
Oh.

282
00:24:00,788 --> 00:24:02,711
Where are you going? Wait.

283
00:24:08,102 --> 00:24:09,561
Please, come back!

284
00:24:13,137 --> 00:24:14,162
Where'd she go?

285
00:24:15,092 --> 00:24:15,832
Hey!

286
00:24:20,165 --> 00:24:20,940
Hey.

287
00:24:25,351 --> 00:24:27,258
So... I...

288
00:24:31,463 --> 00:24:32,857
I came here to give you this.

289
00:24:32,996 --> 00:24:34,263
I, uh...

290
00:24:35,731 --> 00:24:37,478
You left this behind.

291
00:24:42,455 --> 00:24:45,641
What's that? How do I know sign language?

292
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:46,842
From a class.

293
00:24:47,306 --> 00:24:49,283
Here you go. It's yours.

294
00:24:53,623 --> 00:24:56,452
I don't even know if you ever wanted to see this again.

295
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,997
I was wondering...

296
00:25:03,824 --> 00:25:07,029
Can me and you, Shoko,

297
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:09,973
uh... can we be friends?

298
00:25:10,847 --> 00:25:11,848
Is that an opt...

299
00:25:13,485 --> 00:25:15,562
Whoa, what did I just say?

300
00:25:16,174 --> 00:25:19,612
Huh, that's what you were trying to ask me back in school.

301
00:25:19,815 --> 00:25:21,666
I finally understand you.

302
00:25:25,921 --> 00:25:27,271
Don't cry.

303
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,065
Please don't cry, Shoko.

304
00:25:37,466 --> 00:25:39,999
I wanted to ask if we could be friends.

305
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:41,826
Would that be okay?

306
00:25:43,298 --> 00:25:46,335
Sho-Sho, Sho-Sho.

307
00:25:47,433 --> 00:25:50,543
Sho-Sho, Sho-Sho!

308
00:25:50,904 --> 00:25:52,922
Sho-Sho, wake up!

309
00:25:53,613 --> 00:25:55,517
Time for breakfast!

310
00:26:00,385 --> 00:26:02,735
Okay, Sho, up and at 'em.

311
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,775
Good morning, Maria.

312
00:26:08,213 --> 00:26:09,532
Sho-Sho's awake!

313
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,755
I'm heading out.

314
00:26:29,518 --> 00:26:30,790
Bye-bye, Mommy!

315
00:26:30,814 --> 00:26:31,948
Have a good day, dear.

316
00:26:32,942 --> 00:26:34,998
And breakfast is served.

317
00:26:36,003 --> 00:26:37,888
Thank you for this meal. Mm.

318
00:26:38,186 --> 00:26:39,668
Dig in, big guy.

319
00:26:45,902 --> 00:26:48,614
What's got you so bright and cheery this morning?

320
00:26:49,687 --> 00:26:51,134
Because...

321
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:53,670
I found this!

322
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:54,370
Oh.

323
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,893
You've been working so hard at your job,

324
00:26:56,994 --> 00:27:00,419
and you even sold your comics,
your clothes, and your futon.

325
00:27:01,717 --> 00:27:04,894
I am so lucky to have such a thoughtful son.

326
00:27:07,653 --> 00:27:09,730
But tell me, Shoya,

327
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:13,359
why would you wanna kill yourself?

328
00:27:16,072 --> 00:27:17,509
I just, uh...

329
00:27:17,566 --> 00:27:19,850
I've been going through a lot of crazy stuff lately.

330
00:27:20,411 --> 00:27:22,605
What can I say? I just...

331
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:23,565
I knew it.

332
00:27:25,597 --> 00:27:27,663
I knew something was going on with you!

333
00:27:27,707 --> 00:27:29,962
Do not even try to deny it!

334
00:27:29,987 --> 00:27:33,129
Your room is clean for a change.
You cancelled your phone service

335
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:36,738
and everything after April's
been torn off from your calendar!

336
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:40,519
I can't believe it, it's so morbid.

337
00:27:40,908 --> 00:27:44,201
Promise me you won't go through
with it or I'm torching this.

338
00:27:44,268 --> 00:27:48,128
The 1.7 million yen you earned will go to waste!

339
00:27:50,221 --> 00:27:52,615
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?

340
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,670
Uh, yeah.

341
00:27:55,001 --> 00:27:56,394
Don't do anything crazy, Mom.

342
00:27:56,419 --> 00:27:57,047
Crazy?

343
00:27:57,072 --> 00:27:58,755
You were gonna off yourself!

344
00:27:58,779 --> 00:27:59,753
No, wait!

345
00:27:59,893 --> 00:28:02,198
I'm sorry, Mom. I'm really sorry.

346
00:28:02,236 --> 00:28:04,196
I won't do it again. I swear I won't.

347
00:28:04,221 --> 00:28:05,036
Please don't burn it.

348
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,217
What are you not gonna do?

349
00:28:06,242 --> 00:28:07,267
Be specific!

350
00:28:07,418 --> 00:28:09,395
I promise I'm not going to kill myself.

351
00:28:09,581 --> 00:28:12,099
I swear I won't do it. Please believe me.

352
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:13,565
Do you mean it?

353
00:28:14,134 --> 00:28:15,376
I swear to you.

354
00:28:16,233 --> 00:28:16,986
Okay.

355
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:19,280
Then I won't burn this.

356
00:28:19,816 --> 00:28:21,043
Mom, watch out!

357
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:22,675
Ooh, fire!

358
00:28:22,718 --> 00:28:24,882
Ow, my fingers!

359
00:28:25,591 --> 00:28:27,330
Ah, get me some water!

360
00:28:32,554 --> 00:28:34,687
Oh, smokey!

361
00:28:36,384 --> 00:28:40,561
Yesterday, I was planning to jump off
a really tall bridge and kill myself.

362
00:28:41,694 --> 00:28:45,471
I only went to see Shoko
Nishimiya to wrap up any loose ends.

363
00:28:47,462 --> 00:28:51,004
It was hands-down the greatest test of courage ever.

364
00:28:51,737 --> 00:28:53,699
Well, it was supposed to be anyway.

365
00:29:07,502 --> 00:29:09,253
Can we be friends?

366
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,067
I'm the world's biggest loser!

367
00:29:16,685 --> 00:29:18,550
On the first day of junior high,

368
00:29:18,945 --> 00:29:21,075
Kazuki made sure everyone knew.

369
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,649
You should probably stay away from Shoya Ishida.

370
00:29:23,692 --> 00:29:24,708
He's a bully.

371
00:29:25,433 --> 00:29:28,713
He's so bad, a girl had to switch schools.

372
00:29:32,755 --> 00:29:36,633
Like they always say, what goes around comes around.

373
00:29:37,703 --> 00:29:39,663
I knew I royally screwed up,

374
00:29:40,354 --> 00:29:42,547
and that I needed to pay for being a jerk.

375
00:29:43,928 --> 00:29:47,970
And so, I pushed everyone away.

376
00:30:26,973 --> 00:30:28,291
Alright, everyone.

377
00:30:28,316 --> 00:30:31,593
Make sure to have this translated by next week's class.

378
00:30:41,177 --> 00:30:42,543
Hey, Shoya.

379
00:30:43,069 --> 00:30:45,164
Uh, Miki.

380
00:30:45,232 --> 00:30:47,961
Have you had a chance to hand in your math notebook yet?

381
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,727
Oh, sorry. I forgot.

382
00:30:50,023 --> 00:30:51,038
That's okay.

383
00:30:51,348 --> 00:30:53,293
Just try to hand it in soon, alright?

384
00:30:53,512 --> 00:30:54,128
Sorry.

385
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,120
No problem.

386
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:00,609
Wanna go sit in the courtyard?

387
00:31:02,138 --> 00:31:04,374
Shoya never hangs out with anyone.

388
00:31:04,592 --> 00:31:05,761
What a loser.

389
00:31:06,276 --> 00:31:09,186
Didn't you hear about him? Everyone knows.

390
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:11,155
No way, dude!

391
00:31:12,435 --> 00:31:15,077
Hey, check it out. He's looking at us again.

392
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:18,657
Wonder if he gets lonely being by himself all the time.

393
00:31:19,485 --> 00:31:20,967
What a total freak.

394
00:31:21,545 --> 00:31:23,142
Why does he bother living?

395
00:31:26,791 --> 00:31:29,271
Oh, hey. I got their new album.

396
00:31:29,386 --> 00:31:30,593
You wanna check it out?

397
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:34,149
Yeah, since you like them, I don't anymore.

398
00:31:34,174 --> 00:31:35,741
Yeah, me too.

399
00:31:40,997 --> 00:31:42,312
Yeah, right.

400
00:32:02,552 --> 00:32:04,496
I've seen that head before.

401
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:06,940
Who is he?

402
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:11,407
Uh.

403
00:32:17,776 --> 00:32:19,125
It doesn't matter.

404
00:32:20,296 --> 00:32:22,178
Should I go and see Shoko again?

405
00:32:23,176 --> 00:32:25,265
She said she feeds the koi bread.

406
00:32:26,219 --> 00:32:30,049
But I can't just show up there.
Not after everything I've done.

407
00:32:32,013 --> 00:32:34,680
Should I go and apologize for making her cry?

408
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:37,971
She did say she's there every Tuesday.

409
00:32:38,864 --> 00:32:40,475
Or is it too creepy?

410
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:40,895
Huh?

411
00:32:52,901 --> 00:32:54,895
Hey, Mom. I'm home.

412
00:33:05,392 --> 00:33:06,853
Hi, Sho.

413
00:33:08,344 --> 00:33:10,411
You scared the crap out of me. What's up?

414
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,953
Uh, I... I'm sorry.

415
00:33:16,151 --> 00:33:18,592
For burning all your hard-earned money.

416
00:33:19,058 --> 00:33:20,479
I didn't mean to.

417
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:21,612
Uh...

418
00:33:21,984 --> 00:33:25,946
But then again, you only earned
that money so you could kill yourself.

419
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:27,846
So I don't want it anyway.

420
00:33:29,546 --> 00:33:31,785
Sorry, Mom. I'll earn it back.

421
00:33:32,297 --> 00:33:33,874
I know you will!

422
00:33:33,917 --> 00:33:36,093
But I don't want you to worry too much about it.

423
00:33:36,187 --> 00:33:38,280
In the meantime, how 'bout some dinner?

424
00:33:38,306 --> 00:33:38,982
Who's hungry?

425
00:33:39,007 --> 00:33:40,823
Ooh, ooh, I'm hungry!

426
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,666
Tuesday.

427
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,360
Hey, let me borrow your bike.

428
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,706
Who, me?

429
00:34:00,881 --> 00:34:02,797
Huh? What do you need my bicycle for?

430
00:34:02,822 --> 00:34:04,190
That kid I saw at lunch.

431
00:34:04,233 --> 00:34:06,273
I forgot something at home so

432
00:34:06,327 --> 00:34:07,637
I need your bike to get it.

433
00:34:07,661 --> 00:34:08,107
What?

434
00:34:08,132 --> 00:34:09,699
But I don't even know you.

435
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,754
Why can't you just use your own bike?

436
00:34:13,155 --> 00:34:16,002
I'm asking you because I don't have one.

437
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,501
No, please don't.

438
00:34:18,552 --> 00:34:19,467
Give it up, fatso.

439
00:34:19,492 --> 00:34:20,181
Wait, stop.

440
00:34:20,276 --> 00:34:22,868
I'm being robbed! Somebody help me!

441
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,796
Anybody out there!

442
00:34:26,821 --> 00:34:28,823
Why won't anyone help me?

443
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:29,988
Shut up!

444
00:34:30,423 --> 00:34:32,030
God, you're annoying.

445
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,936
Just let go of the damn bike already!

446
00:34:35,961 --> 00:34:36,864
Hey, uh...

447
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,581
What?

448
00:34:37,691 --> 00:34:40,536
Do you wanna borrow mine? It's over there.

449
00:34:40,643 --> 00:34:42,728
Yeah? Thanks man.

450
00:34:42,841 --> 00:34:44,336
You're a godsend.

451
00:34:47,973 --> 00:34:49,625
Of course he stole it.

452
00:34:51,193 --> 00:34:53,002
And today's Tuesday.

453
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:54,895
Of all days.

454
00:34:55,341 --> 00:34:58,238
So is that a sign that I should just leave her alone?

455
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:03,259
It's not like I can't just walk there,
but it's like I'm being told not to go.

456
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:06,247
I need a good reason.

457
00:35:07,644 --> 00:35:08,269
Huh?

458
00:35:10,426 --> 00:35:11,950
Something real.

459
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:16,115
So it doesn't look like I'm trying too hard.

460
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,041
Half off fluffy new bread.

461
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:25,855
This is it!

462
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,353
Is Shoko Nishimiya here?

463
00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:30,560
She's not here.

464
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:32,588
She's right there.

465
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:33,962
Not her.

466
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,989
There's nobody here named Shoko.

467
00:35:38,171 --> 00:35:40,136
Who are you anyway?

468
00:35:40,161 --> 00:35:43,109
I mean, are you actually a friend of hers?

469
00:35:43,898 --> 00:35:44,984
Thought so.

470
00:35:51,654 --> 00:35:53,137
Nothing to worry about.

471
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,914
There was a rat in the hallway.

472
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,073
A really gross one.

473
00:36:01,976 --> 00:36:04,354
Don't worry. He won't be back.

474
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,359
Can we be friends?

475
00:36:27,862 --> 00:36:30,516
Huh? What the...?

476
00:36:32,077 --> 00:36:33,923
Oh, found him!

477
00:36:33,948 --> 00:36:36,640
Hey, you! Over here!

478
00:36:36,665 --> 00:36:39,193
Look, check it out. I found your bike.

479
00:36:39,265 --> 00:36:40,752
This is yours, isn't it?

480
00:36:42,776 --> 00:36:44,543
What perfect timing!

481
00:36:44,628 --> 00:36:47,264
Oh, it's a good thing you had your address on it.

482
00:36:48,354 --> 00:36:49,352
That's great.

483
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:51,481
But where did you find it?

484
00:36:51,574 --> 00:36:54,035
That jerk dumped it in a rice field.

485
00:36:54,061 --> 00:36:56,403
Man, it took me forever to find it.

486
00:36:56,623 --> 00:36:58,047
Thank goodness I did.

487
00:36:58,411 --> 00:36:59,994
And I found you, too.

488
00:37:06,903 --> 00:37:08,576
Is something wrong?

489
00:37:08,849 --> 00:37:10,551
What? Nothing.

490
00:37:10,941 --> 00:37:13,381
Tell me. What's your name, anyway?

491
00:37:13,455 --> 00:37:16,096
But, you don't already know?

492
00:37:16,121 --> 00:37:19,301
Tomohiro Nagatsuka. I sit behind you.

493
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:21,876
Right, I knew that.

494
00:37:22,429 --> 00:37:25,146
It's really good bread. You wanna split it with me?

495
00:37:25,434 --> 00:37:26,393
Shoya!

496
00:37:27,734 --> 00:37:29,040
Hey there, Shoya.

497
00:37:30,265 --> 00:37:31,432
Good morning.

498
00:37:31,523 --> 00:37:33,583
Uh, morning.

499
00:37:36,315 --> 00:37:37,622
Hey, Shoya.

500
00:37:37,894 --> 00:37:40,306
Do you wanna hang out with me after school today?

501
00:37:40,423 --> 00:37:42,312
I mean, since we're friends now.

502
00:37:43,278 --> 00:37:44,794
Shoya, over here!

503
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,171
I saved you a seat!

504
00:38:08,738 --> 00:38:10,471
What's troubling you, Yasho?

505
00:38:11,176 --> 00:38:13,471
Huh? It's nothing.

506
00:38:13,743 --> 00:38:14,673
Who's Yasho?

507
00:38:14,697 --> 00:38:15,612
It's your nickname.

508
00:38:15,637 --> 00:38:16,725
Shows that we're close.

509
00:38:16,749 --> 00:38:17,863
Oh, cool.

510
00:38:19,914 --> 00:38:22,321
Well, so tell me what's troubling you?

511
00:38:22,404 --> 00:38:25,670
You know you can tell me anything.
That's what best friends are for.

512
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:32,228
Hey, do you mind if I ask you something?

513
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:35,369
What does it mean to become someone's friend?

514
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:39,937
Like, is there some sort of
friendship process you go through?

515
00:38:40,261 --> 00:38:43,052
Or like, do you need any specific qualifications?

516
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:45,922
'Ey, Yasho.

517
00:38:49,678 --> 00:38:51,053
Give me ya hand, 'kay?

518
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:56,803
'Ey, 'ey.

519
00:39:04,222 --> 00:39:06,380
Now you and I is friends.

520
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:08,689
It can be as simple as that, see.

521
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:12,367
Friendship don't gotta do with no rules or qualifications,

522
00:39:12,411 --> 00:39:14,181
'cause it's about something deeper.

523
00:39:14,465 --> 00:39:17,275
A bond. And ya just can't break that.

524
00:39:18,505 --> 00:39:19,303
Capiche?

525
00:39:21,736 --> 00:39:23,357
She's not here.

526
00:39:23,701 --> 00:39:24,898
She's right there.

527
00:39:24,922 --> 00:39:25,750
She's not.

528
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:31,100
Listen, I think maybe... Shoko's my girlfriend, okay?

529
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:34,825
Oh, well, that sucks.

530
00:39:34,942 --> 00:39:36,827
Uh, not for me personally,

531
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,533
because I brought her all this bread.

532
00:39:38,985 --> 00:39:42,767
But... I-I didn't know that Shoko was into younger guys.

533
00:39:42,902 --> 00:39:46,013
I mean, nothing against you. I
just never would have guessed.

534
00:39:46,224 --> 00:39:47,976
Can you at least give her the bread?

535
00:39:48,001 --> 00:39:48,527
It's really good.

536
00:39:48,551 --> 00:39:49,005
Listen.

537
00:39:49,492 --> 00:39:53,811
If you're just here to make yourself
feel better, you might as well leave.

538
00:39:57,496 --> 00:40:00,802
If you'll excuse me, goodbye.

539
00:40:01,528 --> 00:40:03,027
Listen, boy!

540
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:04,245
What's your problem?

541
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:05,977
My friend here just wants to see Miss Shoko.

542
00:40:06,002 --> 00:40:06,484
'Kay?

543
00:40:06,508 --> 00:40:07,202
Where'd you come from?

544
00:40:07,227 --> 00:40:09,542
So stop being so stubborn and go get her!

545
00:40:09,567 --> 00:40:11,807
Seriously, what are you even doing here?

546
00:40:11,901 --> 00:40:12,462
Ugh!

547
00:40:12,856 --> 00:40:15,762
I followed you. Friends have each other's backs.

548
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:19,351
The shitty stalker has his own shitty stalker.

549
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:21,105
Makes you two a load of crap.

550
00:40:21,824 --> 00:40:24,562
What? What was that?

551
00:40:25,078 --> 00:40:26,251
What did you say?!

552
00:40:26,276 --> 00:40:27,484
Okay, let's all chill out.

553
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:29,952
I called out your bullshit,
which makes you a piece of shit.

554
00:40:29,977 --> 00:40:31,365
That doesn't sound good.

555
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,369
What's going on out there?

556
00:40:32,393 --> 00:40:33,120
I'll teach you some respect!

557
00:40:33,145 --> 00:40:34,322
Sounds like Yuzuru.

558
00:40:34,346 --> 00:40:35,420
Wash your mouth out with soap!

559
00:40:37,311 --> 00:40:38,401
Would you please calm down?

560
00:40:38,426 --> 00:40:39,441
Oh, my.

561
00:40:40,276 --> 00:40:42,273
Seriously, man. Don't worry about it.

562
00:40:42,298 --> 00:40:43,605
Let's just get out of here.

563
00:40:44,535 --> 00:40:45,984
Oh, hello.

564
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:48,232
Aren't you the nice boy from the other day?

565
00:40:48,286 --> 00:40:49,913
It wasn't me.

566
00:40:49,938 --> 00:40:51,931
It must have been someone else.

567
00:40:52,299 --> 00:40:54,352
Sorry, buddy. You're on your own!

568
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:55,942
Hey, take that!

569
00:40:58,411 --> 00:40:59,951
Hey, they're gone!

570
00:41:00,304 --> 00:41:01,132
Great.

571
00:41:01,157 --> 00:41:02,340
He got to see her after all.

572
00:41:02,365 --> 00:41:03,880
Nice, smooth.

573
00:41:06,106 --> 00:41:09,259
What are you doing? You spying on Shoko and Yasho?

574
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,587
Hand it over. I wanna see.

575
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,336
Man, Yasho sure does talk with his hands a lot.

576
00:41:16,361 --> 00:41:18,436
It's called sign language, dumbass.

577
00:41:18,461 --> 00:41:19,034
What?

578
00:41:19,493 --> 00:41:20,567
Oh, wow.

579
00:41:20,877 --> 00:41:23,505
I'm tellin' ya. My man's got real skills.

580
00:41:23,803 --> 00:41:25,645
Do you understand sign?

581
00:41:25,935 --> 00:41:27,312
Tell me what they're saying!

582
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:31,355
Who was that loser you were with?

583
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:35,659
I have never seen him before in my life.

584
00:41:35,684 --> 00:41:37,876
He was disgusting!

585
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:39,519
Shut up, liar!

586
00:41:39,543 --> 00:41:40,919
Alright, fine.

587
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:43,393
Hm.

588
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:46,029
Don't fall over, be careful.

589
00:41:46,695 --> 00:41:48,308
The truth is,

590
00:41:48,627 --> 00:41:52,350
I wasn't sure if it was okay to come see you.

591
00:41:52,764 --> 00:41:55,019
For the past two weeks,

592
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:59,960
I've been wondering whether you
and I could be considered friends.

593
00:42:00,372 --> 00:42:02,251
In order to see you,

594
00:42:02,276 --> 00:42:05,396
I felt like I needed a good reason.

595
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:10,008
And finally, I found one.

596
00:42:11,773 --> 00:42:13,427
Wow, what a great guy.

597
00:42:14,723 --> 00:42:16,350
I'm glad you did.

598
00:42:16,504 --> 00:42:20,989
I was thinking the exact same thing.

599
00:42:21,234 --> 00:42:23,080
It's funny, isn't it?

600
00:42:24,693 --> 00:42:27,705
Uh, so anyway, uh...

601
00:42:27,802 --> 00:42:29,720
I brought you some bread to feed the fish.

602
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,066
Do you enjoy feeding the fish?

603
00:42:40,234 --> 00:42:42,025
Duh, she can't hear me.

604
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:47,772
Huh?

605
00:42:57,607 --> 00:43:00,337
Oh, uh, wait.

606
00:43:00,404 --> 00:43:03,931
Uh, now that I think about it, you
really don't wanna read that stuff.

607
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:15,997
Ah!

608
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:18,036
Wait, what are you doing?

609
00:43:21,555 --> 00:43:22,497
She fell in!

610
00:43:22,521 --> 00:43:23,139
No way!

611
00:43:23,202 --> 00:43:25,228
What happened? Is Yasho okay?

612
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:27,163
Hey, talk to me boy!

613
00:43:27,796 --> 00:43:29,711
Ah! He went into the river!

614
00:43:29,787 --> 00:43:30,632
Why?

615
00:43:32,003 --> 00:43:33,596
What did you do that for?

616
00:43:46,591 --> 00:43:47,728
What the...?

617
00:43:49,265 --> 00:43:50,810
Over here, Shoko.

618
00:43:58,811 --> 00:43:59,899
Shoko!

619
00:44:02,863 --> 00:44:05,046
I'm really sorry that I dropped that.

620
00:44:14,974 --> 00:44:15,770
Uh.

621
00:44:31,773 --> 00:44:34,263
I don't believe it. What a dummy.

622
00:44:49,138 --> 00:44:50,879
So long, stalker.

623
00:44:50,923 --> 00:44:52,395
Have you seen this?

624
00:44:53,055 --> 00:44:55,845
Seriously, is that really Shoya?

625
00:44:56,241 --> 00:44:57,581
See ya later.

626
00:44:59,373 --> 00:45:00,479
So it's okay.

627
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,925
Uh, hey, Shoya.

628
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:07,679
We've all been wondering.

629
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:09,283
Is that you?

630
00:45:09,338 --> 00:45:11,898
Uh, where'd you get that?

631
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:21,022
Mr. Ishida, report to the faculty office immediately.

632
00:45:24,783 --> 00:45:28,569
I jumped into the river from the Sui Mubushii Bridge,

633
00:45:28,613 --> 00:45:30,602
even though I know it's prohibited.

634
00:45:30,658 --> 00:45:32,112
And I posted a picture on the Internet...

635
00:45:32,182 --> 00:45:32,758
Shoya!

636
00:45:33,399 --> 00:45:33,931
Yeah?

637
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:37,919
Sorry to ask, but do you think
you could pick up Maria for me?

638
00:45:38,405 --> 00:45:41,234
Well, I'm not supposed to leave
the house while I'm still suspended.

639
00:45:41,259 --> 00:45:42,906
Oh, come on, it'll only take a second.

640
00:45:42,931 --> 00:45:43,373
Uh...

641
00:45:43,539 --> 00:45:44,629
You're a lifesaver. Thanks.

642
00:45:44,654 --> 00:45:47,178
Wait! Ugh, really?

643
00:46:02,369 --> 00:46:05,533
Okay, Maria. It's time to go home now.

644
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:09,357
Sho-Sho, there's somebody in there!

645
00:46:12,408 --> 00:46:13,993
Uh, wait.

646
00:46:15,432 --> 00:46:16,463
Hey, you.

647
00:46:17,366 --> 00:46:19,281
Wake up. You okay?

648
00:46:21,753 --> 00:46:24,510
Aren't you Shoko Nishimiya's boyfriend?

649
00:46:24,689 --> 00:46:26,691
You're gonna catch a cold like this.

650
00:46:27,491 --> 00:46:30,390
Oh, if it isn't the stalker.

651
00:46:32,161 --> 00:46:33,474
What are you doing?

652
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:34,994
How'd you end up sleeping here?

653
00:46:37,409 --> 00:46:39,070
Where are your shoes?

654
00:46:42,027 --> 00:46:43,488
Aren't you mad at me?

655
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:44,691
Uh, 'bout what?

656
00:46:47,201 --> 00:46:49,769
I'm the one who posted the photo of you online.

657
00:46:50,437 --> 00:46:52,135
Oh, so that was you.

658
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:58,005
Thank goodness. What a relief, seriously.

659
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:00,508
For reals?

660
00:47:00,731 --> 00:47:03,491
At least I have a pretty good idea of why you did it.

661
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:06,720
You're not angry?

662
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:08,446
Why should I be?

663
00:47:09,021 --> 00:47:11,660
I mean, I kind of brought this on myself.

664
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:14,638
Sho-Sho, I'm hungry!

665
00:47:15,537 --> 00:47:16,757
Okay.

666
00:47:17,243 --> 00:47:18,548
Looks like I've gotta take off.

667
00:47:19,101 --> 00:47:20,729
You should probably be heading home, too.

668
00:47:21,377 --> 00:47:24,306
Crazy. Can't believe you've got a kid.

669
00:47:24,419 --> 00:47:27,860
Ow! She's my sister's. Sheesh.

670
00:47:37,242 --> 00:47:38,380
Whoa, whoa, hey!

671
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,740
Here you go, Yuzuru.

672
00:47:42,964 --> 00:47:45,020
Eat as much as you want, 'kay?

673
00:47:45,652 --> 00:47:46,661
Where'd sis go?

674
00:47:47,078 --> 00:47:49,080
She said she'd be back late.

675
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:52,227
Well, Maria, do you like it?

676
00:47:52,252 --> 00:47:53,372
I love it!

677
00:47:53,396 --> 00:47:54,305
Oh, great!

678
00:47:54,429 --> 00:47:56,652
What's wrong Yuzuru? Not hungry?

679
00:47:57,283 --> 00:47:58,749
Oh, I know!

680
00:47:59,764 --> 00:48:00,679
Ahh!

681
00:48:00,704 --> 00:48:02,592
Open wide.

682
00:48:31,229 --> 00:48:32,400
Crap.

683
00:48:52,835 --> 00:48:53,317
Hm?

684
00:48:54,834 --> 00:48:55,336
Huh?

685
00:48:55,774 --> 00:48:57,354
What are you doing out here?

686
00:48:58,453 --> 00:48:59,843
I woke up and you were gone.

687
00:49:01,681 --> 00:49:03,030
Here, take it.

688
00:49:03,978 --> 00:49:04,393
No.

689
00:49:04,417 --> 00:49:05,568
Ow, stop it.

690
00:49:05,623 --> 00:49:08,092
What are you doing? Just take it, okay?

691
00:49:09,729 --> 00:49:10,535
Thank you.

692
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:12,609
Hang on, are you not...?

693
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:14,013
Wha... hey, ah!

694
00:49:14,037 --> 00:49:15,291
Just as I thought.

695
00:49:15,682 --> 00:49:16,752
Wanna wear these?

696
00:49:18,036 --> 00:49:19,858
They actually used to be mine.

697
00:49:20,105 --> 00:49:21,331
Don't fit anymore.

698
00:49:21,396 --> 00:49:22,441
You can keep 'em.

699
00:49:24,416 --> 00:49:27,637
So, uh... why'd you run away from home?

700
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:32,130
I got into a fight with Shoko.

701
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,010
Wha... wow.

702
00:49:34,075 --> 00:49:36,486
Well, it's true what they say.

703
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:39,854
Relationships can get messy sometimes, right?

704
00:49:40,402 --> 00:49:44,324
Yeah, it's 'cause I used Shoko's
shampoo without her permission.

705
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:48,301
And she told me that she doesn't need me anymore.

706
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:52,176
Wait, are the two of you living together?

707
00:49:55,333 --> 00:49:57,465
Stop it. I'm just getting more wet.

708
00:49:57,490 --> 00:49:59,984
What's the point of bringing an umbrella then?

709
00:50:00,145 --> 00:50:03,506
Right, but I'm the idiot who
didn't think to bring two of them.

710
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:07,442
Besides, I'll feel bad for
Shoko if you come back with a cold.

711
00:50:10,242 --> 00:50:13,375
Seriously? Just who do you think you are?

712
00:50:13,419 --> 00:50:14,765
I see through your act.

713
00:50:14,869 --> 00:50:15,571
Huh?

714
00:50:15,856 --> 00:50:17,964
What are we, a couple of strays?

715
00:50:18,165 --> 00:50:20,744
You doing this to feel better about yourself?

716
00:50:20,992 --> 00:50:23,975
Must be extra amusing to you because she's deaf, right?

717
00:50:24,122 --> 00:50:27,608
Yeah, you even went to the trouble to learn how to sign.

718
00:50:28,824 --> 00:50:29,889
Big deal.

719
00:50:29,914 --> 00:50:32,620
You think that suddenly makes you a hero or something?

720
00:50:32,773 --> 00:50:34,384
I still can't stand you.

721
00:50:36,311 --> 00:50:36,840
Uh...

722
00:50:38,854 --> 00:50:39,507
I see.

723
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:43,110
I guess Shoko told you all about me, huh?

724
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:46,505
Well, you're right.

725
00:50:47,409 --> 00:50:48,866
I am a horrible person.

726
00:50:49,477 --> 00:50:52,313
The world would probably be better off if I wasn't around.

727
00:50:53,807 --> 00:50:54,642
But still.

728
00:50:55,673 --> 00:50:58,376
I just don't wanna cause Shoko any more pain.

729
00:50:59,703 --> 00:51:01,964
Oh, but that doesn't mean

730
00:51:01,989 --> 00:51:03,935
I'm gonna try and horn in on your turf.

731
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:05,408
You don't have to worry about that.

732
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:08,720
That said, it's true.

733
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,975
I guess I am being a bit selfish.

734
00:51:19,404 --> 00:51:20,057
Huh?

735
00:51:26,796 --> 00:51:28,182
This is far enough.

736
00:51:28,206 --> 00:51:28,740
Okay.

737
00:51:31,236 --> 00:51:32,193
By the way...

738
00:51:33,702 --> 00:51:36,575
I'm sorry I didn't tell you this earlier, but uh,

739
00:51:37,329 --> 00:51:39,067
I'm actually Shoko's...

740
00:51:40,278 --> 00:51:41,366
Know what I mean?

741
00:51:48,466 --> 00:51:49,179
Uh...

742
00:51:49,252 --> 00:51:50,565
Younger sister?

743
00:51:50,641 --> 00:51:51,383
Later.

744
00:51:53,294 --> 00:51:54,933
Ah, Ah...

745
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,323
Uh.

746
00:52:00,134 --> 00:52:02,066
Oh, I remember you.

747
00:52:02,091 --> 00:52:03,415
You're Shoko's m...

748
00:52:07,446 --> 00:52:08,208
Let's go.

749
00:52:10,362 --> 00:52:13,431
Ow, Mom, that hurts!

750
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,066
I'm sorry for what I did.

751
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,007
I'm back.

752
00:52:22,468 --> 00:52:23,990
Yuzuru!

753
00:52:24,014 --> 00:52:25,085
Don't hug me.

754
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:26,205
You'll get all wet.

755
00:52:26,229 --> 00:52:27,170
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

756
00:52:27,306 --> 00:52:29,124
I want to apologize too.

757
00:52:29,836 --> 00:52:32,128
Granny, there any shiso juice left?

758
00:52:32,413 --> 00:52:33,545
I'd like some.

759
00:52:34,071 --> 00:52:34,816
Yuzuru.

760
00:52:35,574 --> 00:52:37,692
I don't want you hanging around that boy.

761
00:52:38,002 --> 00:52:39,553
Tell your sister that, too.

762
00:52:42,365 --> 00:52:45,227
I can decide who to hang out with on my own.

763
00:52:45,291 --> 00:52:46,759
Same with Shoko.

764
00:52:48,835 --> 00:52:51,202
Oh, the Prodigal Son returns.

765
00:52:51,227 --> 00:52:52,917
How are you doing this fine day?

766
00:52:52,942 --> 00:52:54,086
You come back for a rematch?

767
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:55,948
I'm just returning the umbrella I borrowed.

768
00:52:55,973 --> 00:52:57,800
Oh, that's surprising.

769
00:52:57,825 --> 00:52:59,315
So, our young lad has some manners after all.

770
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:01,935
Uh, Nagatsuka, that lad's actually a lass.

771
00:53:01,959 --> 00:53:02,352
Huh?

772
00:53:02,838 --> 00:53:05,212
That's Shoko's little sister.

773
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:07,929
Uh, I knew that the entire time.

774
00:53:13,113 --> 00:53:16,237
I wanted to thank you for
looking out for my homeboy, Yasho.

775
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:20,463
This is my friend, Nagatsuka.

776
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:24,967
Hm.

777
00:53:24,991 --> 00:53:26,838
Oh, oh yeah.

778
00:53:27,017 --> 00:53:28,772
I got a new cellphone.

779
00:53:29,363 --> 00:53:32,250
I'm guessing you have a cellphone too, don't you?

780
00:53:33,844 --> 00:53:36,589
So, do you ever text?

781
00:53:36,947 --> 00:53:40,052
Like with you friends? From your new school.

782
00:53:40,546 --> 00:53:44,936
That's great! So, uh, anyone you want to meet?

783
00:53:45,105 --> 00:53:47,662
I-I mean do you need anyone's phone number?

784
00:53:48,666 --> 00:53:51,280
Oh, good! Maybe you'd like to have mine?

785
00:53:52,269 --> 00:53:52,965
What's that?

786
00:53:53,767 --> 00:53:56,377
Sa-ha-ra.

787
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:02,738
Miyoko? From elementary school?

788
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,868
Hey, Yasho.

789
00:54:11,396 --> 00:54:14,965
Well? So how are you gonna track down this Miyoko chick?

790
00:54:16,076 --> 00:54:18,905
Well, no, that's not exactly true.

791
00:54:19,009 --> 00:54:21,424
But you get straight A's, don't you?

792
00:54:23,047 --> 00:54:25,005
Oh, yeah. That's it.

793
00:54:27,107 --> 00:54:27,681
Yasho?

794
00:54:27,705 --> 00:54:29,022
But, Satoshi, I didn't even...

795
00:54:29,066 --> 00:54:30,291
Uh, Miki?

796
00:54:30,316 --> 00:54:30,780
Hm?

797
00:54:31,431 --> 00:54:32,302
What's up?

798
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:35,901
Uh, there's something I wanted to ask you.

799
00:54:36,203 --> 00:54:38,931
Do you know how to get in touch with Miyoko Sahara?

800
00:54:39,219 --> 00:54:41,681
She went to the same elementary school as us.

801
00:54:41,706 --> 00:54:42,592
Miyoko?

802
00:54:43,602 --> 00:54:45,449
Sorry, I have no idea.

803
00:54:45,778 --> 00:54:48,057
But I bet the school will have some kind of record.

804
00:54:48,103 --> 00:54:50,119
I think Nao goes to the same school as her.

805
00:54:50,344 --> 00:54:52,989
Taiyo Girls Academy.

806
00:54:53,829 --> 00:54:55,805
Crap. I'm flat broke.

807
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:58,660
Yasho, my man. I've got your back, bro.

808
00:54:58,722 --> 00:55:00,289
Wow, where'd that come from?

809
00:55:00,314 --> 00:55:01,886
I don't really need that much.

810
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:03,767
Ah, come on. Let me spot you.

811
00:55:03,792 --> 00:55:07,337
There are travel and meal expenses
and those love motels ain't cheap.

812
00:55:07,362 --> 00:55:09,646
You'll be glad for the extra dough, trust me.

813
00:55:09,671 --> 00:55:11,523
Guys, over here!

814
00:55:11,712 --> 00:55:13,171
Looks like we just made it.

815
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:20,383
My sister was kind of annoyed that she was being
left out since she was the one who suggested it, so...

816
00:55:20,493 --> 00:55:22,496
would you mind if she tagged along with you?

817
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:44,962
Huh?

818
00:55:50,694 --> 00:55:51,214
Oh.

819
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:24,418
Uh... so.

820
00:56:25,738 --> 00:56:27,908
If we start walking from here...

821
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:29,621
Sho?

822
00:56:30,361 --> 00:56:30,905
Sho!

823
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:31,490
Huh?

824
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:33,283
Sorry about that.

825
00:56:34,027 --> 00:56:35,268
Is that you?

826
00:56:35,981 --> 00:56:38,379
It's me, Miyoko!

827
00:56:38,967 --> 00:56:40,323
From school.

828
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:44,994
Hi! Hey, wait. Is that Shoya?

829
00:56:48,066 --> 00:56:49,493
It's been a long time.

830
00:56:49,607 --> 00:56:50,946
Hasn't it, huh?

831
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:57,587
And since the, I've been learning sign.

832
00:56:57,823 --> 00:56:59,161
Or trying.

833
00:56:59,593 --> 00:57:00,601
Was that right?

834
00:57:01,747 --> 00:57:04,598
I know I just kinda disappeared on you back then.

835
00:57:06,641 --> 00:57:08,005
Sorry about that.

836
00:57:08,538 --> 00:57:11,208
But I never stopped thinking about you, ever.

837
00:57:13,226 --> 00:57:15,567
Seeing you makes me happy.

838
00:57:15,968 --> 00:57:17,438
I was so surprised.

839
00:57:22,707 --> 00:57:23,391
Mm-hmm.

840
00:57:25,161 --> 00:57:26,081
Really?

841
00:57:29,001 --> 00:57:33,357
So where are you going to school now, Shoko?

842
00:57:35,382 --> 00:57:38,298
Wow. Well your chest has gotten bigger.

843
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,082
Wonder what size you are.

844
00:57:40,213 --> 00:57:43,347
Want me to check?

845
00:57:46,571 --> 00:57:47,612
What's the matter?

846
00:57:47,746 --> 00:57:50,571
Nothing, I just have to go to the bathroom.

847
00:57:50,688 --> 00:57:52,168
Oh, okay then.

848
00:57:56,246 --> 00:57:57,699
Special offer!

849
00:57:58,195 --> 00:57:59,076
Here you go.

850
00:58:00,383 --> 00:58:01,718
Special offer!

851
00:58:09,948 --> 00:58:10,710
Naoka?

852
00:58:10,734 --> 00:58:11,768
Here you are!

853
00:58:12,299 --> 00:58:13,828
Please come and visit us.

854
00:58:14,405 --> 00:58:15,320
Special offer!

855
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:16,453
Come on, just give it a try.

856
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,053
Meow-Meow Club.

857
00:58:25,739 --> 00:58:27,281
Huh? Hm.

858
00:58:38,771 --> 00:58:41,121
Oh, wow. I'd never have the guts to do that.

859
00:58:42,087 --> 00:58:43,404
Guess they're having fun.

860
00:58:44,233 --> 00:58:44,641
Oh.

861
00:58:45,951 --> 00:58:48,582
Maybe I should reunite her with Naoka as well.

862
00:58:49,141 --> 00:58:52,465
Yeah, that may be the worst idea you've ever had.

863
00:58:53,939 --> 00:58:55,935
On second thought, I'll pass.

864
00:59:01,699 --> 00:59:02,637
Here we are.

865
00:59:03,575 --> 00:59:04,411
Shall we?

866
00:59:04,488 --> 00:59:06,996
Meow-Meow Club, here we come.

867
00:59:07,113 --> 00:59:07,705
Good afternoon.

868
00:59:07,729 --> 00:59:08,419
Welcome.

869
00:59:09,669 --> 00:59:11,901
And how long will you be staying with us?

870
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:13,485
An hour I guess?

871
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:16,502
Uh, I have a coupon.

872
00:59:16,527 --> 00:59:18,620
Oh, good. Right this way.

873
00:59:19,179 --> 00:59:21,675
Crap, he actually came.

874
00:59:22,961 --> 00:59:25,162
This is not what I imagined.

875
00:59:26,928 --> 00:59:29,239
They're cats. What were you expecting?

876
00:59:29,329 --> 00:59:31,622
Well, have you ever been to a place like this?

877
00:59:31,647 --> 00:59:34,819
What? No, I've never. I came here for you, man.

878
00:59:34,845 --> 00:59:36,867
I wanted to help you reunite with your friend.

879
00:59:37,262 --> 00:59:39,307
And, speaking of old friends,

880
00:59:39,495 --> 00:59:40,664
where is she, anyway?

881
00:59:41,306 --> 00:59:44,017
I wouldn't exactly call this girl a friend.

882
00:59:44,208 --> 00:59:45,035
You wouldn't?

883
00:59:45,404 --> 00:59:48,749
A lot of stuff happened when we were in sixth grade.

884
00:59:48,859 --> 00:59:51,394
To be honest, this whole thing's kinda awkward.

885
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:54,480
She isn't here.

886
00:59:58,789 --> 01:00:00,253
Wanna take off, then?

887
01:00:15,526 --> 01:00:16,837
A bug!

888
01:00:17,225 --> 01:00:18,857
Oh, what are you doing here?

889
01:00:19,314 --> 01:00:21,192
I came over to play with Maria.

890
01:00:22,073 --> 01:00:24,874
Hey, uh, do you think Shoko would like this?

891
01:00:24,939 --> 01:00:25,364
Uh.

892
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,141
Kitty!

893
01:00:30,225 --> 01:00:32,265
I brought you a present, Shoko!

894
01:00:47,233 --> 01:00:48,660
What happened?

895
01:00:52,536 --> 01:00:54,156
I'm just gonna leave this here.

896
01:01:04,878 --> 01:01:05,903
Naoka?

897
01:01:06,419 --> 01:01:06,993
W-What...?

898
01:01:07,017 --> 01:01:08,232
Go, go!

899
01:01:09,084 --> 01:01:10,795
Hey, what are you doing?

900
01:01:10,902 --> 01:01:12,399
Long time, no see.

901
01:01:12,582 --> 01:01:14,390
Uh, yeah. Long time, no see.

902
01:01:17,331 --> 01:01:17,991
Hm?

903
01:01:20,061 --> 01:01:22,378
Wait a minute. Isn't that the deaf girl?

904
01:01:22,582 --> 01:01:23,173
Yeah.

905
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:24,991
Still all alone.

906
01:01:25,846 --> 01:01:26,978
Poor thing.

907
01:01:28,605 --> 01:01:31,738
Seriously, Shoya. It really has been way too long.

908
01:01:31,894 --> 01:01:33,228
Let's hang out soon.

909
01:01:33,253 --> 01:01:35,195
Uh, no, I don't think so.

910
01:01:35,472 --> 01:01:37,196
Wow. You really hate me, don't you?

911
01:01:37,221 --> 01:01:39,069
What? No.

912
01:01:39,291 --> 01:01:40,716
I never said that.

913
01:01:41,866 --> 01:01:43,199
You know what, Shoya?

914
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:46,387
I always thought I should have
made more of an effort to talk to you.

915
01:01:46,412 --> 01:01:49,171
I'm sorry about everything
that happened when we were kids.

916
01:01:49,322 --> 01:01:51,701
But it's not like it was that big of a deal.

917
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:54,531
Hey, Naoka.

918
01:01:55,314 --> 01:01:56,033
Get off.

919
01:02:01,681 --> 01:02:04,623
Huh? That's a purse from our café.

920
01:02:04,999 --> 01:02:07,114
Where did that deaf freak get it from?

921
01:02:07,751 --> 01:02:09,056
I gave it to her.

922
01:02:09,565 --> 01:02:11,842
Oh, I see.

923
01:02:16,402 --> 01:02:17,111
Later.

924
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:18,680
Yeah.

925
01:02:23,887 --> 01:02:24,741
Naoka!

926
01:02:25,064 --> 01:02:27,475
Hey there, Shoko. Long time, no see.

927
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:28,905
So how has life been treating you?

928
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:29,538
Stop!

929
01:02:30,059 --> 01:02:31,953
That's weird, there's only one of them.

930
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:33,968
Naoka, what do you think you're doing?

931
01:02:36,105 --> 01:02:37,379
Thought we'd have a game of catch.

932
01:02:37,404 --> 01:02:38,885
Just like when we were kids.

933
01:02:45,117 --> 01:02:47,310
I'm so sorry, Shoko.

934
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,058
No freakin' way.

935
01:02:51,283 --> 01:02:52,718
You gotta be kidding me.

936
01:02:52,743 --> 01:02:53,950
Hold on, wait a minute.

937
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:56,575
Don't tell me you guys are actually going out.

938
01:02:56,726 --> 01:02:59,203
What? What are you talking about?

939
01:02:59,387 --> 01:03:00,536
We're just friends.

940
01:03:00,838 --> 01:03:03,952
Just friends? That's hilarious!

941
01:03:03,977 --> 01:03:07,758
Are you telling me you are now
besties with the girl you used to bully?

942
01:03:08,158 --> 01:03:11,295
I don't believe it. That's crazy!

943
01:03:12,344 --> 01:03:15,129
Let me guess. Are you trying to make amends?

944
01:03:15,367 --> 01:03:16,260
Not really.

945
01:03:18,098 --> 01:03:20,884
Too funny. What's gotten into you?

946
01:03:23,793 --> 01:03:26,988
Well, I'll leave you to your fake friendship thing.

947
01:03:31,651 --> 01:03:32,103
Hm?

948
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:36,897
You wanna know what we were talking about?

949
01:03:37,765 --> 01:03:40,040
Uh, nothing. Don't worry about it.

950
01:03:41,072 --> 01:03:42,704
Look, I gotta take off.

951
01:03:43,444 --> 01:03:44,157
See ya.

952
01:04:05,985 --> 01:04:07,114
Yuzuru.

953
01:04:07,753 --> 01:04:08,906
Uh, yeah?

954
01:04:09,439 --> 01:04:10,547
Time to get up!

955
01:04:10,708 --> 01:04:13,358
I'm up. You startled me awake.

956
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:14,872
Get out of bed. Breakfast is...

957
01:04:14,896 --> 01:04:15,463
Wait!

958
01:04:15,708 --> 01:04:18,027
Before you go. What's up?

959
01:04:20,549 --> 01:04:24,372
Your hair. Today, it's in a ponytail.

960
01:04:24,469 --> 01:04:26,402
Are you, uh...?

961
01:04:27,315 --> 01:04:29,299
Uh, what's with that face?

962
01:04:29,812 --> 01:04:30,682
Uh.

963
01:04:33,408 --> 01:04:35,723
Shoya will love the new 'do.

964
01:04:47,837 --> 01:04:48,576
Huh?

965
01:04:50,817 --> 01:04:52,258
Oh, it's Shoko.

966
01:04:52,662 --> 01:04:54,452
She's wearing a ponytail.

967
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:11,482
Where you goin', Shoya?

968
01:05:11,964 --> 01:05:14,079
What was that? Where am I going?

969
01:05:15,363 --> 01:05:16,883
To the bakery.

970
01:05:17,492 --> 01:05:20,820
Yuzuru asked me to get some bread to feed the koi.

971
01:05:20,866 --> 01:05:22,563
But she already has some bread!

972
01:05:22,588 --> 01:05:24,764
I bet she only wants some more so she can eat it!

973
01:05:24,808 --> 01:05:26,723
Whoa, slow down a sec.

974
01:05:27,045 --> 01:05:28,194
Wait, just...

975
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:29,441
Can you sign it?

976
01:05:31,275 --> 01:05:34,110
Is my voice weird?

977
01:05:34,214 --> 01:05:34,910
Yeah.

978
01:05:37,589 --> 01:05:39,364
Oh, I-I'm sorry, I didn't...

979
01:05:40,415 --> 01:05:43,460
Your voice sounds totally okay.

980
01:05:44,717 --> 01:05:46,926
I'm gonna go get some bread.

981
01:05:48,343 --> 01:05:49,619
Be right back.

982
01:05:54,287 --> 01:05:55,109
Whoa.

983
01:05:56,086 --> 01:05:57,317
What are you doing?

984
01:06:05,957 --> 01:06:08,724
A present for me? Wow, thanks.

985
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:09,790
Can I open it?

986
01:06:12,256 --> 01:06:13,344
Like, right now?

987
01:06:16,022 --> 01:06:17,382
What are these things?

988
01:06:21,653 --> 01:06:23,193
Thank you so much.

989
01:06:27,184 --> 01:06:28,139
I love you.

990
01:06:29,133 --> 01:06:32,097
Huh, what's that? Something about these?

991
01:06:34,399 --> 01:06:35,673
I love you!

992
01:06:41,154 --> 01:06:42,815
Wh... huh?

993
01:06:46,531 --> 01:06:48,948
I love you!

994
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:55,951
Uh...

995
01:06:57,761 --> 01:06:58,781
The moon?

996
01:07:01,607 --> 01:07:02,080
Hm.

997
01:07:02,212 --> 01:07:03,947
It is pretty, isn't it?

998
01:07:08,476 --> 01:07:09,227
I-I...

999
01:07:09,602 --> 01:07:10,771
Where are you going?

1000
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:14,358
Oh.

1001
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:21,388
Can I ask you something?

1002
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:23,376
Do you think these look like the moon?

1003
01:07:23,516 --> 01:07:25,151
Mm, let's see.

1004
01:07:25,176 --> 01:07:27,075
Well, they don't look like the moon.

1005
01:07:27,582 --> 01:07:28,401
Hm...

1006
01:07:29,076 --> 01:07:29,616
Candy!

1007
01:07:29,641 --> 01:07:30,144
Nah.

1008
01:07:30,169 --> 01:07:31,923
I'm pretty sure these things aren't candy.

1009
01:07:32,564 --> 01:07:34,398
Shoko gave these to me as a present.

1010
01:07:34,807 --> 01:07:36,361
I have no idea what they are.

1011
01:07:38,811 --> 01:07:39,305
Hm?

1012
01:07:43,376 --> 01:07:45,197
Are you okay? What happened?

1013
01:07:49,362 --> 01:07:51,062
Ah, you what?!

1014
01:07:55,239 --> 01:07:56,003
Oh.

1015
01:08:03,841 --> 01:08:05,838
Wow, check out your hair! It's different!

1016
01:08:05,882 --> 01:08:07,187
What made you decide to change it?

1017
01:08:07,212 --> 01:08:08,651
Do you have a hot date?

1018
01:08:08,676 --> 01:08:10,843
Whatever it is, you should keep it like this.

1019
01:08:10,868 --> 01:08:14,683
Stop it, you guys. You're making me blush.

1020
01:08:15,067 --> 01:08:17,852
I just didn't have any time to do it, that's all.

1021
01:08:19,039 --> 01:08:20,345
Well, I think it looks good.

1022
01:08:20,427 --> 01:08:22,581
Hey, Miki, I've got a question.

1023
01:08:22,734 --> 01:08:24,656
Why did you suddenly change your hair?

1024
01:08:24,988 --> 01:08:27,335
Uh, what do you mean?

1025
01:08:27,615 --> 01:08:30,403
It's not like I need any particular reason.

1026
01:08:30,428 --> 01:08:30,740
Oh.

1027
01:08:30,764 --> 01:08:33,727
Girls just like to change things up sometimes, you know?

1028
01:08:34,726 --> 01:08:35,553
I see.

1029
01:08:36,267 --> 01:08:37,917
Huh? What is it?

1030
01:08:38,832 --> 01:08:43,364
The other day, Satoshi told me he thought
you'd be a pretty cool guy to hang out with.

1031
01:08:44,113 --> 01:08:44,817
Huh?

1032
01:08:52,232 --> 01:08:54,700
Who are you and tell us the nature of your business.

1033
01:08:54,725 --> 01:08:56,914
Nice to meet you. Miyoko Sahara.

1034
01:08:57,126 --> 01:08:58,750
Hi. Satoshi Mashiba.

1035
01:08:58,862 --> 01:09:01,038
Cut it out! Stop doing that over my head!

1036
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:03,949
Miyoko, it feels like it's been a million years.

1037
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,727
Hey, is Shoko coming today?

1038
01:09:05,787 --> 01:09:07,789
Nah, she has a stomach ache.

1039
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:11,758
Oh, that's weird. I hope she's not avoiding me.

1040
01:09:11,852 --> 01:09:12,580
How come?

1041
01:09:12,848 --> 01:09:15,330
She was trying to tell me something the other day.

1042
01:09:15,408 --> 01:09:17,905
I just could not understand what she was saying.

1043
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:20,273
What exactly did she say to you?

1044
01:09:20,859 --> 01:09:21,586
"The moon."

1045
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:23,878
It's an easy enough word,

1046
01:09:23,903 --> 01:09:26,124
but her saying it didn't make any sense.

1047
01:09:26,544 --> 01:09:28,572
I bet she was so annoyed.

1048
01:09:28,696 --> 01:09:33,447
Well, if you really wanna know how she feels
about you, then I suggest you just ask her out.

1049
01:09:33,491 --> 01:09:35,797
If she says no, you'll have your answer.

1050
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:37,188
I guess that you're right.

1051
01:09:59,256 --> 01:10:01,804
Come on! Let's all go on the big one first!

1052
01:10:01,829 --> 01:10:03,759
Now, everyone stick together so we don't get separated.

1053
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:06,065
Why is she acting like our chaperone or something?

1054
01:10:06,089 --> 01:10:06,917
Who knows?

1055
01:10:07,438 --> 01:10:08,025
Shoya.

1056
01:10:08,189 --> 01:10:08,690
Hm?

1057
01:10:09,483 --> 01:10:11,276
Who's that over there?

1058
01:10:12,549 --> 01:10:14,928
Why is she acting so chummy with Shoko?

1059
01:10:14,953 --> 01:10:17,056
Naoka? Why is she here?

1060
01:10:18,538 --> 01:10:20,364
Is she like a friend or something?

1061
01:10:20,389 --> 01:10:23,514
Uh, yeah. From elementary school.

1062
01:10:24,629 --> 01:10:25,118
Hm.

1063
01:10:30,297 --> 01:10:32,138
Hey, uh, mind if I sit here?

1064
01:10:32,163 --> 01:10:33,761
Not at all, go right ahead.

1065
01:10:36,206 --> 01:10:37,626
It might be scary.

1066
01:10:38,108 --> 01:10:40,297
Okay, everybody. Are you ready?

1067
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:41,723
Yeah!

1068
01:10:41,766 --> 01:10:43,660
Then hold on tight!

1069
01:10:45,817 --> 01:10:49,340
Miyoko, so are you, like, cool with Naoka now?

1070
01:10:49,567 --> 01:10:51,771
Hm? Oh, sure.

1071
01:10:51,829 --> 01:10:54,277
We're actually both in the design department at school.

1072
01:10:55,355 --> 01:10:58,475
Nao's got great taste. I've learned a lot from her.

1073
01:11:00,377 --> 01:11:02,652
You know, when we were in elementary school,

1074
01:11:02,773 --> 01:11:04,904
I was way too scared to ride this.

1075
01:11:04,996 --> 01:11:06,780
I was such a coward back then.

1076
01:11:08,896 --> 01:11:11,987
But the one day, I looked at it differently.

1077
01:11:12,956 --> 01:11:16,857
I was going to wait until after the
ride to decide if it's scary or not.

1078
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:22,110
Can't help feeling a little scared, though.

1079
01:11:22,276 --> 01:11:22,929
Huh?

1080
01:11:23,688 --> 01:11:24,845
Here we go.

1081
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:47,587
Oh! Oh, no!

1082
01:11:47,886 --> 01:11:51,368
Poor Shoko. Your legs are shaking.

1083
01:11:51,424 --> 01:11:53,021
Mm, you okay?

1084
01:11:53,604 --> 01:11:54,146
Mm.

1085
01:11:54,554 --> 01:11:57,144
Hey, that's pretty impressive.

1086
01:11:57,418 --> 01:11:58,731
I didn't know you could sign.

1087
01:11:58,786 --> 01:12:01,641
You must have worked really hard to learn sign language.

1088
01:12:01,682 --> 01:12:02,529
Uh... mm.

1089
01:12:06,517 --> 01:12:08,947
Hey! Get your dirty paws off my Yasho.

1090
01:12:08,972 --> 01:12:10,256
Who said you could touch him, huh?

1091
01:12:10,314 --> 01:12:11,967
Dude, I was just being friendly.

1092
01:12:13,597 --> 01:12:15,574
Well, go be friendly with someone else!

1093
01:12:15,599 --> 01:12:17,932
Oh, Nagatsuka, you really crack me up.

1094
01:12:17,957 --> 01:12:20,275
Yasho is my friend! I've got my eye on you.

1095
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:20,868
You better watch it!

1096
01:12:20,893 --> 01:12:22,802
Hey is that your real hair?

1097
01:12:23,621 --> 01:12:25,101
Knock it off, will ya?

1098
01:12:25,126 --> 01:12:26,780
I'm not joking!

1099
01:12:26,854 --> 01:12:27,865
What's so funny?

1100
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:29,250
What is this?

1101
01:12:29,841 --> 01:12:31,209
Faster, Satoshi!

1102
01:12:31,234 --> 01:12:32,113
They're catching up!

1103
01:12:32,137 --> 01:12:33,105
We can do this, Yasho!

1104
01:12:33,149 --> 01:12:34,368
Come on, pedal harder!

1105
01:12:34,393 --> 01:12:35,302
What is this?

1106
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:37,713
Is it okay?

1107
01:12:38,431 --> 01:12:40,658
Am I allowed to have this much fun?

1108
01:12:41,639 --> 01:12:44,155
This feels so... familiar.

1109
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,192
Ow, ooh.

1110
01:12:46,164 --> 01:12:47,143
Great catch, buddy.

1111
01:12:47,168 --> 01:12:47,824
Oh, yeah.

1112
01:12:48,802 --> 01:12:52,371
It almost feels like... like we're all friends.

1113
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:58,870
Hey, Shoya.

1114
01:12:58,894 --> 01:12:59,654
Uh... huh?

1115
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:02,656
I'm hungry. I feel like some takoyaki.

1116
01:13:02,681 --> 01:13:03,802
Come with me to get some.

1117
01:13:03,827 --> 01:13:06,188
Uh, I'm not... h-hey, wait!

1118
01:13:07,808 --> 01:13:10,432
Here you go. One takoyaki.

1119
01:13:10,457 --> 01:13:11,466
Huh, thank you.

1120
01:13:11,537 --> 01:13:12,529
And Naoka,

1121
01:13:13,329 --> 01:13:15,793
you need to learn how to mind your own business.

1122
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:26,230
Kazuki?

1123
01:13:29,814 --> 01:13:30,728
Huh?

1124
01:13:31,598 --> 01:13:33,211
Shoya, where are you going?

1125
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:37,604
I'll text you later, okay?

1126
01:13:38,649 --> 01:13:39,900
Hey, wait up!

1127
01:13:41,391 --> 01:13:42,609
Are you mad at me?

1128
01:13:43,175 --> 01:13:44,494
No, I'm not.

1129
01:13:45,308 --> 01:13:46,853
I'm fine. Yeah.

1130
01:13:47,503 --> 01:13:50,766
I just thought maybe you guys could be friends.

1131
01:13:50,891 --> 01:13:52,639
You know, like you used to be.

1132
01:13:53,399 --> 01:13:57,937
I guess I was hoping once you guys actually
saw each other, everything would be okay.

1133
01:13:58,036 --> 01:13:59,951
Don't do me any favors, okay?

1134
01:14:01,411 --> 01:14:01,871
Uh.

1135
01:14:03,804 --> 01:14:04,472
Wait.

1136
01:14:05,832 --> 01:14:07,940
I did the exact same thing.

1137
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:15,367
You and I are more alike than you think, you know?

1138
01:14:15,528 --> 01:14:16,729
No, we're not.

1139
01:14:16,861 --> 01:14:17,857
Yes, we are.

1140
01:14:18,457 --> 01:14:19,792
We're nothing alike.

1141
01:14:23,781 --> 01:14:25,609
You know, if Shoko hadn't shown up,

1142
01:14:25,652 --> 01:14:27,837
we would all still be friends and be happy.

1143
01:14:30,219 --> 01:14:31,568
You don't know that.

1144
01:14:31,658 --> 01:14:33,470
Oh, come on, just admit it.

1145
01:14:33,765 --> 01:14:35,271
If it wasn't for her,

1146
01:14:35,314 --> 01:14:37,985
things wouldn't have gotten
all weird between Miyoko and me.

1147
01:14:38,709 --> 01:14:41,450
And then you wouldn't have stopped
being friends with Kazuki, either.

1148
01:14:42,823 --> 01:14:46,115
I just wanna go back to the way
things were before she showed up.

1149
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:48,733
Kazuki and I... that was me.

1150
01:14:48,936 --> 01:14:50,634
I ruined that all on my own.

1151
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,287
Shoya, tell me the truth.

1152
01:14:53,463 --> 01:14:54,594
Do you hate me?

1153
01:14:54,638 --> 01:14:55,555
Probably.

1154
01:14:57,817 --> 01:15:00,412
Fine. Time for a ride on the Ferris wheel!

1155
01:15:00,774 --> 01:15:02,893
I'll go see if Shoko wants to come with me.

1156
01:15:03,148 --> 01:15:03,801
Hey.

1157
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:04,918
Huh?

1158
01:15:05,256 --> 01:15:08,244
Hey, Shoko, you gotta come ride the Ferris wheel with me.

1159
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:09,622
Cut it out, Naoka.

1160
01:15:09,763 --> 01:15:12,097
If you guys are going, can you take my camera?

1161
01:15:12,284 --> 01:15:14,579
I wanna ride that roller coaster again.

1162
01:15:38,657 --> 01:15:41,268
Oh, hi, Yuzuru. Come on in.

1163
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:42,917
Shoya's upstairs in his room.

1164
01:15:43,863 --> 01:15:44,429
Whoa.

1165
01:15:45,004 --> 01:15:46,944
Got a top-secret video for you.

1166
01:15:48,344 --> 01:15:50,476
A video from the Ferris wheel?

1167
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:50,997
Yup.

1168
01:15:51,665 --> 01:15:53,014
How'd you get it?

1169
01:15:53,131 --> 01:15:53,993
Spying.

1170
01:15:54,057 --> 01:15:54,705
What?

1171
01:15:59,877 --> 01:16:01,835
I want you to listen to me carefully.

1172
01:16:02,532 --> 01:16:03,794
I hate you.

1173
01:16:03,883 --> 01:16:06,401
Uh, oh.

1174
01:16:08,393 --> 01:16:09,899
Put that thing away.

1175
01:16:10,303 --> 01:16:13,256
I'm going to speak slowly so you can understand,

1176
01:16:13,458 --> 01:16:15,664
and I'll listen to everything you have to say.

1177
01:16:18,025 --> 01:16:20,444
I'll admit that in elementary school,

1178
01:16:20,469 --> 01:16:23,377
I had no idea what things were like for you,

1179
01:16:23,807 --> 01:16:27,164
but it's not like you tried to
understand what I was going through either.

1180
01:16:27,401 --> 01:16:28,552
Know what I mean?

1181
01:16:28,982 --> 01:16:31,942
And instead of getting a clue like a normal person,

1182
01:16:31,967 --> 01:16:35,223
you just kept giving me that stupid notebook of yours.

1183
01:16:35,303 --> 01:16:39,946
You were always being so weird, and you
would apologize all the time for everything.

1184
01:16:40,073 --> 01:16:41,968
So I tried a different approach.

1185
01:16:42,006 --> 01:16:43,877
I ignored you and blew you off.

1186
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:47,084
That was my way of telling you
that I didn't wanna hang out with you.

1187
01:16:47,286 --> 01:16:52,040
But nope, you just kept coming around
with your stupid book and your stupid signs.

1188
01:16:52,163 --> 01:16:53,599
You're so clueless.

1189
01:16:53,689 --> 01:16:56,495
Then you had to go run crying to the grown-ups.

1190
01:16:56,599 --> 01:16:58,350
You got Shoya in trouble.

1191
01:16:58,735 --> 01:17:02,378
And that's how he ended up losing
every single one of his friends.

1192
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:05,259
You pretty much ruined everything for everyone.

1193
01:17:05,341 --> 01:17:06,732
You get that, right?

1194
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:09,620
I'm sorry.

1195
01:17:09,947 --> 01:17:11,517
God, you still don't get it.

1196
01:17:11,601 --> 01:17:14,027
I'm not looking for another apology from you.

1197
01:17:14,626 --> 01:17:16,454
We were both going through a lot,

1198
01:17:16,639 --> 01:17:19,622
and I don't think either of us
could have done anything differently.

1199
01:17:20,299 --> 01:17:21,099
But still,

1200
01:17:21,413 --> 01:17:23,960
it's not like I wanna be your new best friend or anything.

1201
01:17:24,247 --> 01:17:26,282
I mean, I still hate you a lot,

1202
01:17:26,526 --> 01:17:28,914
and I'm pretty sure you hate me too, right?

1203
01:17:29,386 --> 01:17:32,696
So, why don't we stop pretending
we're something we're not, okay?

1204
01:17:32,962 --> 01:17:33,991
Let's shake on it.

1205
01:17:34,324 --> 01:17:36,012
From one hater to another.

1206
01:17:37,669 --> 01:17:39,381
But you're wrong.

1207
01:17:39,537 --> 01:17:41,178
I don't hate you.

1208
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,677
I-I hate myself.

1209
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:46,180
What did you say?

1210
01:17:46,394 --> 01:17:50,139
What did you say?!

1211
01:17:52,279 --> 01:17:54,667
Well? What are you gonna do?

1212
01:17:55,047 --> 01:17:56,901
You gonna say sorry again?

1213
01:17:57,359 --> 01:18:00,855
It's been five years and you haven't changed a bit.

1214
01:18:00,906 --> 01:18:04,122
You still have no intention of being real with me.

1215
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:10,327
What do you think?

1216
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:13,457
Oh, it's uh...

1217
01:18:17,016 --> 01:18:18,000
All I want...

1218
01:18:19,464 --> 01:18:21,423
is for Shoko to like herself.

1219
01:18:30,591 --> 01:18:32,365
Are you sure it was Naoka?

1220
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:33,826
Yeah, it was her.

1221
01:18:34,601 --> 01:18:37,735
Is there really a lot of bad blood between her and Shoko?

1222
01:18:37,786 --> 01:18:39,309
Uh, why do you ask?

1223
01:18:40,093 --> 01:18:43,422
Miki said something serious went down at your old school.

1224
01:18:44,824 --> 01:18:46,945
Shoko's hearing is really bad.

1225
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:49,431
I mean, she can barely hear anything, right?

1226
01:18:50,315 --> 01:18:50,862
Yeah.

1227
01:18:51,399 --> 01:18:55,831
It just occurred to me, maybe that's why she
kept getting bullied all the time, you know?

1228
01:18:57,328 --> 01:18:59,707
You'd have to be a major douche bag.

1229
01:19:00,026 --> 01:19:01,687
Who bullies a deaf kid?

1230
01:19:02,019 --> 01:19:03,979
What's wrong with people, right?

1231
01:19:04,514 --> 01:19:05,819
What are you saying?

1232
01:19:05,883 --> 01:19:09,000
Wait, you think I'm spreading rumors
about what happened in elementary school?

1233
01:19:09,024 --> 01:19:11,724
Shh, will you keep it down? The whole school can hear you.

1234
01:19:13,699 --> 01:19:16,956
I really wanted to believe that
you had actually changed, Shoya.

1235
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,854
But you are still the same awful
person you were in elementary school!

1236
01:19:19,878 --> 01:19:20,620
You okay, Yasho?

1237
01:19:20,645 --> 01:19:22,479
Can you just please calm down a second?

1238
01:19:22,981 --> 01:19:24,417
Hey, guys, what's going on?

1239
01:19:24,442 --> 01:19:26,689
Remember when I told you Shoko was bullied?

1240
01:19:26,735 --> 01:19:29,665
Well, it was Shoya! He was the one who used to bully her!

1241
01:19:32,175 --> 01:19:34,117
How can you say that, Miki?

1242
01:19:34,746 --> 01:19:35,932
Yasho would never do that.

1243
01:19:35,975 --> 01:19:37,814
Why would I make up something like that?

1244
01:19:39,028 --> 01:19:41,331
But you used to make fun of her too, Miki.

1245
01:19:41,530 --> 01:19:45,198
I never, ever said anything horrible behind Shoko's back.

1246
01:19:45,223 --> 01:19:46,904
What? You picked on Shoko?

1247
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:47,972
Yeah, it was him!

1248
01:19:47,997 --> 01:19:50,434
He was the one who made Shoko's life a living hell.

1249
01:19:52,548 --> 01:19:53,799
It was so awful.

1250
01:19:53,950 --> 01:19:56,362
I kept begging him to leave her alone,

1251
01:19:56,698 --> 01:19:58,930
but Shoya never listens to anyone.

1252
01:19:59,429 --> 01:20:01,072
I was so scared of him.

1253
01:20:03,988 --> 01:20:07,223
Yasho, what's wrong?

1254
01:20:07,732 --> 01:20:08,955
Sorry, gotta go.

1255
01:20:08,979 --> 01:20:09,800
Are you okay?

1256
01:20:11,957 --> 01:20:13,537
Hey, Yasho!

1257
01:20:42,068 --> 01:20:44,918
Yeah, I hate me too.

1258
01:20:56,315 --> 01:20:58,038
Hey, we're over here!

1259
01:20:58,063 --> 01:20:58,737
Hi!

1260
01:21:00,903 --> 01:21:02,069
Is something wrong?

1261
01:21:03,796 --> 01:21:05,303
Oh, no, not really.

1262
01:21:06,326 --> 01:21:07,507
It's nothing.

1263
01:21:07,531 --> 01:21:07,912
Oh.

1264
01:21:09,325 --> 01:21:11,427
There he is, my main man!

1265
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:13,611
I brought your backpack for you.

1266
01:21:13,745 --> 01:21:14,787
Hey, guys.

1267
01:21:14,811 --> 01:21:15,778
Naoka?

1268
01:21:16,785 --> 01:21:18,195
I asked her to come.

1269
01:21:22,229 --> 01:21:24,100
I'm sorry about what happened.

1270
01:21:25,171 --> 01:21:26,215
But, well...

1271
01:21:26,778 --> 01:21:29,607
you were the one who started causing all that trouble.

1272
01:21:30,133 --> 01:21:31,458
The thing is,

1273
01:21:31,938 --> 01:21:37,210
Satoshi said I should go ahead and forgive you
since you've been trying to make things right with Shoko.

1274
01:21:38,067 --> 01:21:42,114
Are you kidding me? This is wrong on so many levels.

1275
01:21:42,166 --> 01:21:44,582
You can't blame everything that happened on Shoya.

1276
01:21:44,739 --> 01:21:45,994
We were all guilty.

1277
01:21:47,243 --> 01:21:47,983
We?

1278
01:21:48,673 --> 01:21:50,237
But, Nao, that isn't true.

1279
01:21:50,262 --> 01:21:51,053
What's not?

1280
01:21:52,034 --> 01:21:56,895
I never made fun of Shoko or did anything
to bully her the way the rest of you guys did.

1281
01:21:57,247 --> 01:21:58,935
Don't lump me in with you!

1282
01:22:00,219 --> 01:22:01,345
Naoka.

1283
01:22:02,315 --> 01:22:03,855
Oh...

1284
01:22:04,645 --> 01:22:06,090
Hm, you're right.

1285
01:22:06,413 --> 01:22:08,909
You and I are completely different.

1286
01:22:09,002 --> 01:22:11,570
You just sat back and laughed along with everyone else.

1287
01:22:11,914 --> 01:22:12,932
Did not!

1288
01:22:13,049 --> 01:22:14,530
Just ask Miyoko.

1289
01:22:15,165 --> 01:22:16,309
What, me?

1290
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:19,757
Naoka used to talk about you
behind your back all the time, too!

1291
01:22:19,782 --> 01:22:21,937
I just said what everyone else was thinking.

1292
01:22:23,446 --> 01:22:25,953
Well, Miyoko, wanna weigh in?

1293
01:22:26,721 --> 01:22:29,528
Uh, to be completely honest,

1294
01:22:29,845 --> 01:22:33,413
back then, I was... I was scared of both of you.

1295
01:22:33,438 --> 01:22:35,525
What? Whose side are you on anyway?

1296
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:37,119
I'm not on anyone's side.

1297
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:38,152
Just stop.

1298
01:22:39,824 --> 01:22:41,257
It was my fault, okay?

1299
01:22:41,642 --> 01:22:42,877
It's all my fault.

1300
01:22:44,668 --> 01:22:46,507
I can't stand martyrs.

1301
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:50,254
That's enough, Naoka.

1302
01:22:51,016 --> 01:22:53,683
Stop trying to drag everybody else down to your level.

1303
01:22:53,889 --> 01:22:55,410
That was harsh. You didn't have to p...

1304
01:22:55,435 --> 01:22:56,829
Oh, please, Miyoko.

1305
01:22:57,203 --> 01:23:00,257
We all know that you just run
away whenever things get tense.

1306
01:23:00,938 --> 01:23:01,939
Shoya.

1307
01:23:02,104 --> 01:23:03,033
What's gotten into you?

1308
01:23:03,057 --> 01:23:06,119
God, will you just stop talking?

1309
01:23:06,683 --> 01:23:09,048
You really love the sound of your own voice, don't you?

1310
01:23:10,147 --> 01:23:13,555
Listen, man. No matter what
anyone says, I've got your back.

1311
01:23:13,798 --> 01:23:15,357
I don't care.

1312
01:23:15,682 --> 01:23:17,336
Will you just back off?

1313
01:23:17,519 --> 01:23:18,607
You hardly know me.

1314
01:23:18,632 --> 01:23:20,186
I can't take this anymore.

1315
01:23:20,211 --> 01:23:21,661
I'm not staying here!

1316
01:23:22,015 --> 01:23:24,735
It's alright, you don't mean it.

1317
01:23:25,204 --> 01:23:27,425
But I'm gonna give you some space.

1318
01:23:29,861 --> 01:23:31,075
Hey, Shoko.

1319
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:32,997
Later.

1320
01:23:39,504 --> 01:23:40,982
I'm sorry, Shoya.

1321
01:23:42,605 --> 01:23:45,089
I never should have agreed to come here to begin with.

1322
01:23:48,062 --> 01:23:50,987
That's not cool. You were way too harsh.

1323
01:23:52,447 --> 01:23:55,442
What do you know? You're not
even really part of our group.

1324
01:23:56,415 --> 01:23:57,967
I thought we were friends.

1325
01:24:11,176 --> 01:24:12,210
Almost forgot.

1326
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:15,007
So, starting next week,

1327
01:24:15,511 --> 01:24:17,093
it's summer vacation.

1328
01:24:17,882 --> 01:24:20,050
Do you wanna go somewhere special?

1329
01:24:41,089 --> 01:24:44,387
You're going to ruin your eyes
reading in the dark like that.

1330
01:24:50,416 --> 01:24:51,417
Here.

1331
01:24:58,182 --> 01:25:01,838
You spend so much time worried about your big sister.

1332
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:07,314
Now I'm starting to worry about you, sweetie.

1333
01:25:07,911 --> 01:25:10,844
You get so caught up in Shoko's life,

1334
01:25:10,883 --> 01:25:13,305
that you never leave any time for yourself.

1335
01:25:13,330 --> 01:25:16,116
I could say the same thing about you, Granny.

1336
01:25:16,227 --> 01:25:20,230
Instead of going to the senior center,
all you do is study sign language.

1337
01:25:20,839 --> 01:25:24,469
That's something I'm doing for
myself, so that doesn't really count.

1338
01:25:24,629 --> 01:25:28,559
What a coincidence, because I'm
doing all these things for myself, too.

1339
01:25:29,796 --> 01:25:30,507
Really?

1340
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:36,432
You are such a good kid.

1341
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:37,959
You think so?

1342
01:25:38,130 --> 01:25:43,120
Mom chews me out on a daily basis, and
I haven't gone to school in like weeks.

1343
01:25:43,493 --> 01:25:46,145
Yes, sweetie, but you've got a heart of gold.

1344
01:25:46,699 --> 01:25:48,875
Shoko's no slouch, either.

1345
01:25:50,847 --> 01:25:53,589
I've got some mighty fine grandchildren.

1346
01:25:58,163 --> 01:25:59,977
Have one of the mochi, too.

1347
01:26:00,298 --> 01:26:01,360
You've got it!

1348
01:26:16,525 --> 01:26:17,182
Granny.

1349
01:26:30,316 --> 01:26:32,191
Hey there, Shoko.

1350
01:26:32,526 --> 01:26:35,756
So today, I was able to score us some really great bread.

1351
01:26:35,917 --> 01:26:36,569
See?

1352
01:26:37,450 --> 01:26:39,200
It's awesome, like you're awesome.

1353
01:26:39,598 --> 01:26:40,120
Um.

1354
01:26:41,024 --> 01:26:43,496
Like really great bread is awesome.

1355
01:26:43,521 --> 01:26:45,787
This loaf here is just like you.

1356
01:26:46,831 --> 01:26:48,728
Well, that makes no sense.

1357
01:26:49,622 --> 01:26:50,132
Uh.

1358
01:26:52,056 --> 01:26:53,824
I wonder if she's coming today.

1359
01:26:57,319 --> 01:26:58,180
Guess not.

1360
01:26:59,073 --> 01:27:01,320
Is your stomach bothering you?

1361
01:27:02,219 --> 01:27:03,337
Is that too personal?

1362
01:27:12,959 --> 01:27:13,873
Hey!

1363
01:27:14,362 --> 01:27:15,157
Yuzu...!

1364
01:27:29,297 --> 01:27:30,428
Oh, I should go.

1365
01:27:30,512 --> 01:27:31,421
Shoya.

1366
01:27:31,445 --> 01:27:31,846
Huh?

1367
01:27:32,147 --> 01:27:32,880
Hey there.

1368
01:27:33,119 --> 01:27:34,555
What the heck are you wearing?

1369
01:27:34,783 --> 01:27:37,091
What's it look like? My uniform.

1370
01:27:37,165 --> 01:27:38,793
What do you think? Ya like?

1371
01:27:38,846 --> 01:27:40,081
Why are you wearing it?

1372
01:27:40,106 --> 01:27:42,268
For school, duh.

1373
01:27:42,621 --> 01:27:45,513
Uh, but we're on summer break right now.

1374
01:27:46,736 --> 01:27:48,662
So what's really going on?

1375
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:52,829
Nothing is going on, I swear.

1376
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:55,619
If anyone asks, tell 'em I'm cosplaying.

1377
01:27:56,112 --> 01:27:56,672
Uh.

1378
01:27:58,102 --> 01:28:00,915
That was from my sister so I better take off.

1379
01:28:00,940 --> 01:28:02,366
Where to? I'll walk you there.

1380
01:28:02,466 --> 01:28:03,641
What? No, it's fine.

1381
01:28:03,746 --> 01:28:04,801
You sure you're okay?

1382
01:28:05,048 --> 01:28:06,740
Yeah, everything's cool.

1383
01:28:07,269 --> 01:28:08,977
Then why were you crying just now?

1384
01:28:09,709 --> 01:28:10,424
Come on.

1385
01:28:13,237 --> 01:28:16,110
This actually doesn't have anything to do with you.

1386
01:28:16,732 --> 01:28:17,776
Sure it does.

1387
01:28:18,496 --> 01:28:20,336
At least, I think so.

1388
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:21,443
Why?

1389
01:28:22,210 --> 01:28:23,960
I'm just worried about you, okay?

1390
01:28:26,083 --> 01:28:29,118
I don't believe it. You sound just like my grandma.

1391
01:28:30,936 --> 01:28:33,483
Alright, if you wanna come, then come.

1392
01:28:36,994 --> 01:28:37,920
This is it.

1393
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,826
Thanks for walking me.

1394
01:28:40,479 --> 01:28:41,586
I appreciate it.

1395
01:28:44,411 --> 01:28:45,248
See ya.

1396
01:28:51,507 --> 01:28:52,953
Good luck, Yuzuru.

1397
01:28:56,658 --> 01:28:58,780
Shoya, wait.

1398
01:29:01,854 --> 01:29:03,679
Truth is, I'm scared.

1399
01:30:59,109 --> 01:31:00,651
Whoa, that's cool.

1400
01:31:03,184 --> 01:31:05,498
Come on, Shoko. Let's go check it out!

1401
01:31:07,964 --> 01:31:08,549
Uh.

1402
01:31:14,906 --> 01:31:16,091
Shoko?

1403
01:31:18,939 --> 01:31:19,680
Ah!

1404
01:31:24,878 --> 01:31:26,172
I'm fine, really.

1405
01:31:28,536 --> 01:31:30,475
Uh, why are you apologizing?

1406
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:38,540
That's totally not true.

1407
01:31:38,904 --> 01:31:43,372
Hey, are you busy tomorrow? Let's hang out tomorrow, too.

1408
01:31:47,812 --> 01:31:51,358
Shoko said that I'll be miserable whenever I'm with her.

1409
01:31:54,079 --> 01:31:56,006
But I'm the one who made her unhappy.

1410
01:31:57,183 --> 01:31:58,016
It was me.

1411
01:32:08,336 --> 01:32:11,985
One thing to see

1412
01:32:13,354 --> 01:32:17,455
And to have someone love me

1413
01:32:18,593 --> 01:32:21,660
Even monsters feel

1414
01:32:22,894 --> 01:32:24,684
In their heart

1415
01:32:27,447 --> 01:32:29,925
There's no going back to the way things were.

1416
01:32:35,245 --> 01:32:39,142
Hey, Shoko! Cool. I see Yuzuru's gonna tag along with us.

1417
01:32:39,168 --> 01:32:40,275
Let's check out a movie.

1418
01:32:41,832 --> 01:32:43,346
This is hilarious!

1419
01:32:43,493 --> 01:32:45,822
Hey, greetings, classmates!

1420
01:32:45,924 --> 01:32:47,355
I gotta say,

1421
01:32:47,455 --> 01:32:49,551
this has been the best summer break ever!

1422
01:32:49,612 --> 01:32:50,753
Just ask Yuzuru.

1423
01:32:50,777 --> 01:32:51,673
Whatever.

1424
01:32:51,727 --> 01:32:54,442
Seriously, we're having an absolute blast!

1425
01:32:54,467 --> 01:32:57,143
What about tomorrow? We should go somewhere fun!

1426
01:32:57,343 --> 01:32:59,029
Any ideas where we should go?

1427
01:32:59,087 --> 01:33:01,782
Sorry, but we already have plans for tomorrow.

1428
01:33:02,499 --> 01:33:02,977
Hmm?

1429
01:33:04,778 --> 01:33:06,557
Huh? No way! Are you insane?

1430
01:33:06,582 --> 01:33:07,757
She wants to make what?

1431
01:33:07,906 --> 01:33:09,045
You sure it's okay?

1432
01:33:09,737 --> 01:33:11,627
I feel like I really shouldn't be here.

1433
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:16,805
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is
to assist us in baking our mother's birthday cake.

1434
01:33:17,397 --> 01:33:19,047
Are you absolutely sure?

1435
01:33:19,534 --> 01:33:20,840
I don't wanna get hit again.

1436
01:33:20,865 --> 01:33:21,996
She won't hit you.

1437
01:33:22,108 --> 01:33:23,652
She'll probably kill you this time.

1438
01:33:23,677 --> 01:33:24,510
For real?

1439
01:33:25,543 --> 01:33:28,208
Whoa, that looks amazing!

1440
01:33:28,465 --> 01:33:28,847
Hm?

1441
01:33:30,379 --> 01:33:31,554
Why is he here?

1442
01:33:31,626 --> 01:33:33,454
What is that boy doing in our kitchen?

1443
01:33:33,479 --> 01:33:35,036
I want an explanation right now.

1444
01:33:35,094 --> 01:33:35,350
Come on, Mom.

1445
01:33:35,394 --> 01:33:35,876
Get out.

1446
01:33:35,901 --> 01:33:37,225
Don't be like that.

1447
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:40,297
It's a party, we're supposed to be celebrating!

1448
01:33:40,341 --> 01:33:41,081
Yuzuru.

1449
01:33:41,105 --> 01:33:42,314
You look great.

1450
01:33:49,433 --> 01:33:50,387
Mm.

1451
01:33:51,282 --> 01:33:54,479
You lucked out. Looks like Mom isn't gonna kill you.

1452
01:33:54,746 --> 01:33:55,599
Wow.

1453
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:57,465
I declare a victory.

1454
01:33:57,490 --> 01:33:59,365
Speaking of winning...

1455
01:33:59,509 --> 01:34:03,395
I submitted some of your photography
to the local contest, Yuzuru.

1456
01:34:03,421 --> 01:34:04,910
Hm? You what?

1457
01:34:04,935 --> 01:34:06,736
It was actually your sister's idea.

1458
01:34:10,709 --> 01:34:13,563
Wha...? But I'm no good, I'm just messing around.

1459
01:34:13,588 --> 01:34:15,249
Oh, come on. That's not true.

1460
01:34:15,862 --> 01:34:18,807
Why would you do this to me?

1461
01:34:19,876 --> 01:34:23,945
Before I forget, next Tuesday you're coming
to see the fireworks with us still, right?

1462
01:34:26,147 --> 01:34:27,496
I-I don't have to.

1463
01:34:27,541 --> 01:34:29,363
You're totally coming.

1464
01:34:41,812 --> 01:34:43,445
Is here okay?

1465
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:44,525
Yeah, this is good.

1466
01:35:13,647 --> 01:35:15,900
Well, perfect time to go buy snacks.

1467
01:35:16,071 --> 01:35:17,160
Wanna come, Mom?

1468
01:35:29,191 --> 01:35:30,403
Thank you.

1469
01:35:31,227 --> 01:35:34,568
Um, thanks for inviting me over the other day, too.

1470
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:35,935
Your mom...

1471
01:35:36,707 --> 01:35:38,520
you really think she was happy?

1472
01:35:39,533 --> 01:35:40,584
I couldn't tell.

1473
01:35:42,079 --> 01:35:43,634
Speaking of which,

1474
01:35:43,812 --> 01:35:45,770
I don't know when your birthday is.

1475
01:35:46,989 --> 01:35:50,125
Your birthday was June 7th.

1476
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:53,360
Oh, no! I missed it. That's too bad.

1477
01:35:53,709 --> 01:35:55,879
I can't believe you're already 18.

1478
01:35:56,214 --> 01:35:58,581
Next year, we'll celebrate together.

1479
01:35:59,060 --> 01:36:00,449
We'll throw a big party.

1480
01:36:01,173 --> 01:36:03,219
I made it sound like we're together.

1481
01:36:27,205 --> 01:36:29,947
I get it now. That makes perfect sense.

1482
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:32,919
That's why you closed your eyes.

1483
01:36:35,150 --> 01:36:36,946
Huh? Where are you going?

1484
01:36:40,597 --> 01:36:42,313
What, why now?

1485
01:36:42,371 --> 01:36:44,396
The fireworks only just started.

1486
01:36:47,018 --> 01:36:48,370
To go study?

1487
01:36:49,665 --> 01:36:50,547
Okay.

1488
01:36:51,170 --> 01:36:53,363
Well, hey, wait up. I'll walk you home.

1489
01:36:54,688 --> 01:36:55,862
But why?

1490
01:37:02,499 --> 01:37:05,023
Oh, well, see you later.

1491
01:37:15,470 --> 01:37:17,970
Hey, what happened to Shoko?

1492
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:21,362
Ugh, I forgot my camera!

1493
01:37:21,387 --> 01:37:23,693
Would you mind going back to our place to get it?

1494
01:37:37,047 --> 01:37:38,174
I'm comin' in.

1495
01:37:38,579 --> 01:37:40,008
Man, it's so dark.

1496
01:37:40,281 --> 01:37:41,712
Hey, Shoko, you here?

1497
01:37:41,776 --> 01:37:43,136
It's me, Shoya.

1498
01:37:43,992 --> 01:37:45,167
Good, there it is.

1499
01:37:46,331 --> 01:37:48,987
Mm, I should make sure it's fully charged.

1500
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:52,369
Huh, you can see the fireworks from here.

1501
01:37:54,116 --> 01:37:56,510
Oh, so that's where she is. Hm?

1502
01:37:57,852 --> 01:38:00,598
What is she...? Hey.

1503
01:38:01,031 --> 01:38:02,639
W-wait a second.

1504
01:38:03,231 --> 01:38:04,533
What is she doing?

1505
01:38:04,758 --> 01:38:05,967
Hey, Shoko.

1506
01:38:09,505 --> 01:38:11,454
Uh, Shoko?

1507
01:38:22,786 --> 01:38:24,152
Don't do it!

1508
01:38:30,409 --> 01:38:31,255
Please no.

1509
01:38:34,095 --> 01:38:35,779
Shoko!

1510
01:39:07,162 --> 01:39:10,035
You have to grab on to the railing.

1511
01:39:10,868 --> 01:39:14,367
Please God, if you give me one more ounce of strength,

1512
01:39:14,718 --> 01:39:16,995
I won't run away from my problems anymore.

1513
01:39:17,911 --> 01:39:20,401
Just do this one thing for me, please.

1514
01:39:21,451 --> 01:39:24,915
Starting tomorrow, I'll look everyone in the eye.

1515
01:39:26,364 --> 01:39:27,592
Starting tomorrow,

1516
01:39:28,379 --> 01:39:30,389
I'll listen when people speak to me.

1517
01:39:31,376 --> 01:39:34,525
Starting tomorrow, I'll be better.

1518
01:39:35,195 --> 01:39:36,947
Shoko.

1519
01:39:39,424 --> 01:39:40,577
There it is.

1520
01:39:40,834 --> 01:39:43,010
The scar I gave her all those years ago.

1521
01:39:43,213 --> 01:39:45,611
Did I ever even apologize for that?

1522
01:39:46,753 --> 01:39:47,667
I'm sorry.

1523
01:39:48,226 --> 01:39:50,010
Sorry for everything, Shoko.

1524
01:39:50,642 --> 01:39:51,978
Are you still mad at me?

1525
01:39:53,641 --> 01:39:54,642
I'm so dumb.

1526
01:39:55,587 --> 01:39:58,121
I should have asked her what she really thinks of me.

1527
01:39:58,805 --> 01:40:00,349
And now I don't know if...

1528
01:40:01,651 --> 01:40:02,779
By the way, Shoko,

1529
01:40:03,445 --> 01:40:04,838
I think that I might...

1530
01:40:17,691 --> 01:40:18,984
Hey there, Sho.

1531
01:40:19,107 --> 01:40:22,110
Your sister whipped you up some of her famous pancakes.

1532
01:40:22,289 --> 01:40:24,776
I'm gonna watch the fireworks!

1533
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:38,173
It's cold.

1534
01:40:39,143 --> 01:40:40,628
It's warm.

1535
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:07,995
Mrs. Ishida!

1536
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:10,195
Ah, what are you doing here?

1537
01:41:11,017 --> 01:41:12,418
I'm glad I caught you.

1538
01:41:12,512 --> 01:41:15,763
I tried calling the salon, but it was closed.

1539
01:41:15,965 --> 01:41:18,315
I just wanted to know about Shoya.

1540
01:41:18,368 --> 01:41:20,517
Well, he's doing a lot better.

1541
01:41:20,591 --> 01:41:22,474
They moved him out of the ICU.

1542
01:41:22,752 --> 01:41:25,644
I was going to his new room. Do you want to come with me?

1543
01:41:25,936 --> 01:41:28,001
Um, do you know if Shoya will...

1544
01:41:28,025 --> 01:41:29,088
Mrs. Ishida.

1545
01:41:29,139 --> 01:41:31,489
Uh, Mrs. Nishimiya.

1546
01:41:32,535 --> 01:41:35,529
I'm sorry for all the trouble Shoya has caused.

1547
01:41:35,554 --> 01:41:38,949
I know what he did in the past
is unforgivable but I want y...

1548
01:41:39,751 --> 01:41:40,977
Please forgive me.

1549
01:41:41,876 --> 01:41:43,613
What on earth are you doing?

1550
01:41:43,638 --> 01:41:44,965
Get up.

1551
01:41:44,990 --> 01:41:46,815
I'm sure Shoya must have done
something, otherwise, this wouldn't've...

1552
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:47,636
Mrs. Ishida.

1553
01:41:47,661 --> 01:41:51,134
Shoya was trying to save my stupid sister.

1554
01:41:51,354 --> 01:41:54,129
If I had done better...

1555
01:41:54,630 --> 01:41:56,360
She wouldn't have...

1556
01:41:56,598 --> 01:41:58,785
I'm so sorry.

1557
01:41:59,402 --> 01:42:00,507
Please don't.

1558
01:42:01,357 --> 01:42:03,757
Come on, both of you. Please get up.

1559
01:42:03,782 --> 01:42:06,271
I'm just glad that Shoko is okay.

1560
01:42:06,568 --> 01:42:08,413
And you too, Yuzuru.

1561
01:42:09,183 --> 01:42:10,801
So please, get up.

1562
01:42:12,843 --> 01:42:16,246
Why is Shoya lying in a hospital bed instead of you?

1563
01:42:16,446 --> 01:42:19,363
Don't you dare try to play the victim!

1564
01:42:21,188 --> 01:42:22,525
Say something!

1565
01:42:22,775 --> 01:42:26,765
What, you finally felt bad for all
the problems you created for everyone

1566
01:42:26,812 --> 01:42:28,762
so you decided to kill yourself?

1567
01:42:28,787 --> 01:42:31,397
And now all you can say is "I'm sorry"?

1568
01:42:31,422 --> 01:42:32,282
Is that it?

1569
01:42:32,326 --> 01:42:34,371
Well, that's not going to cut it anymore!

1570
01:42:34,483 --> 01:42:35,912
Who do you think you are, huh?

1571
01:42:36,006 --> 01:42:38,400
You're a loser... a deaf loser.

1572
01:42:38,443 --> 01:42:42,084
You sit there in your own little world
and ignore everyone else around you.

1573
01:42:42,136 --> 01:42:44,234
You're the most selfish person I know!

1574
01:42:45,107 --> 01:42:46,120
Ah!

1575
01:42:49,019 --> 01:42:51,139
Hey, who the hell are you?

1576
01:42:55,852 --> 01:42:58,125
You must be the little loser's mother!

1577
01:42:58,205 --> 01:42:58,654
Stop.

1578
01:42:58,678 --> 01:43:02,537
If you can't keep your kid in line
then do us all a favor and stop breathing!

1579
01:43:02,562 --> 01:43:04,048
What are you two doing?

1580
01:43:04,844 --> 01:43:05,921
That's enough.

1581
01:43:09,026 --> 01:43:11,892
I said that's enough. Stop it!

1582
01:43:12,314 --> 01:43:14,800
What is wrong with the both of you?

1583
01:43:25,740 --> 01:43:28,451
Shoko, are you okay?

1584
01:43:36,263 --> 01:43:37,902
I'm sorry!

1585
01:43:43,508 --> 01:43:45,155
I'm so sorry!

1586
01:43:50,873 --> 01:43:52,983
It's all my fault!

1587
01:44:05,194 --> 01:44:06,239
What are you doing?

1588
01:44:07,455 --> 01:44:10,010
I thought if she saw what death looked like,

1589
01:44:10,035 --> 01:44:12,950
she'd stop saying she wanted to kill herself.

1590
01:44:17,297 --> 01:44:21,003
I didn't know what else to do.

1591
01:44:43,444 --> 01:44:44,068
Mm.

1592
01:44:56,815 --> 01:44:57,271
Oh.

1593
01:45:08,168 --> 01:45:11,188
I can't open it. Someone is holding it shut.

1594
01:45:11,254 --> 01:45:13,551
Oh, I didn't notice you there, Shoko.

1595
01:45:13,576 --> 01:45:14,947
Are you, uh, thirsty?

1596
01:45:15,098 --> 01:45:16,824
How about I buy you a drink?

1597
01:45:18,411 --> 01:45:21,234
I heard about what happened with you and Yasho.

1598
01:45:26,062 --> 01:45:28,760
Does this have to do with that stuff on the bridge?

1599
01:45:29,919 --> 01:45:34,217
Yasho was kind and openhearted
enough to accept a guy like me.

1600
01:45:34,368 --> 01:45:36,287
For the first time,

1601
01:45:36,345 --> 01:45:39,368
I know what it feels like to have a true friend.

1602
01:45:43,743 --> 01:45:46,405
Yasho is my best friend in the whole world.

1603
01:45:46,566 --> 01:45:47,930
So I know he'll wake up.

1604
01:45:47,955 --> 01:45:48,986
He just has to.

1605
01:45:55,790 --> 01:45:56,221
Hm?

1606
01:46:02,365 --> 01:46:03,025
Uh.

1607
01:46:06,086 --> 01:46:08,541
You wanted to die because you were suffering?

1608
01:46:08,566 --> 01:46:09,763
What were you thinking?

1609
01:46:09,787 --> 01:46:10,834
Just calm down!

1610
01:46:10,894 --> 01:46:11,929
Everybody's staring.

1611
01:46:11,953 --> 01:46:13,422
I don't care who's listening!

1612
01:46:13,466 --> 01:46:16,435
I have to be loud in order for Shoko to hear me!

1613
01:46:19,716 --> 01:46:22,222
We were all so worried about you.

1614
01:46:22,247 --> 01:46:24,635
I know life can be hard sometimes,

1615
01:46:24,686 --> 01:46:26,577
but it's like that for everyone.

1616
01:46:27,275 --> 01:46:28,232
The thing is,

1617
01:46:28,687 --> 01:46:33,408
you have to accept the bad parts of
yourself with the good and just move forward.

1618
01:46:37,406 --> 01:46:39,342
I'm really glad you're okay.

1619
01:46:42,715 --> 01:46:43,622
I see.

1620
01:46:43,729 --> 01:46:46,084
So you went to see everyone then, huh?

1621
01:46:46,790 --> 01:46:48,118
That's awesome.

1622
01:46:50,217 --> 01:46:53,213
But I'm not as brave as you.

1623
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:56,479
Even if Shoya does wake up from his coma,

1624
01:46:56,851 --> 01:47:00,233
I think I'd be too ashamed to face him

1625
01:47:00,595 --> 01:47:03,348
'Cause he's right. I haven't changed one bit.

1626
01:47:03,633 --> 01:47:06,245
You needed help and I still wasn't there for you.

1627
01:47:06,402 --> 01:47:08,353
I'm the same coward I've always been.

1628
01:47:09,550 --> 01:47:12,139
You can change. Start now.

1629
01:47:13,844 --> 01:47:15,205
It's not too late.

1630
01:47:18,723 --> 01:47:21,438
I'm really glad you came to see me, Sho.

1631
01:47:47,950 --> 01:47:48,763
Huh?

1632
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:02,870
Hey!

1633
01:48:03,807 --> 01:48:04,591
Stop it.

1634
01:48:05,334 --> 01:48:06,685
Cut it out.

1635
01:49:44,821 --> 01:49:45,842
No, Shoko!

1636
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:50,823
What is all this?

1637
01:49:51,052 --> 01:49:53,000
Mom? Hello?

1638
01:49:53,191 --> 01:49:54,679
What's going on?

1639
01:50:02,191 --> 01:50:03,366
Shoko!

1640
01:50:04,846 --> 01:50:06,223
Almost there.

1641
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:18,181
She isn't here.

1642
01:50:22,729 --> 01:50:24,211
I'm so sorry.

1643
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:34,183
Huh?

1644
01:50:38,969 --> 01:50:39,575
Yo.

1645
01:51:07,968 --> 01:51:08,472
Hm.

1646
01:51:22,358 --> 01:51:23,937
Hey, why are you crying?

1647
01:51:30,020 --> 01:51:30,504
Hm.

1648
01:51:32,347 --> 01:51:33,512
I'm really glad

1649
01:51:35,898 --> 01:51:36,887
you're okay.

1650
01:51:39,719 --> 01:51:40,995
Don't worry, Shoko.

1651
01:51:41,596 --> 01:51:44,684
I am fine now, I promise.

1652
01:51:45,835 --> 01:51:47,298
Well, more or less.

1653
01:51:48,944 --> 01:51:51,911
So stop looking so gloomy, okay?

1654
01:51:52,779 --> 01:51:53,779
Oh, yeah.

1655
01:51:57,623 --> 01:51:58,896
I wanna tell you...

1656
01:52:00,988 --> 01:52:02,293
that I'm really sorry.

1657
01:52:03,029 --> 01:52:04,605
I never apologized

1658
01:52:05,046 --> 01:52:07,367
for all the stuff I did to you when we were kids.

1659
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:11,499
Or any of the other stuff afterwards, either.

1660
01:52:12,403 --> 01:52:13,567
So I'm sorry.

1661
01:52:15,621 --> 01:52:16,752
But the thing is,

1662
01:52:17,127 --> 01:52:20,445
even though you were going
through a lot, I was being selfish

1663
01:52:20,970 --> 01:52:22,420
and focused on myself.

1664
01:52:22,843 --> 01:52:24,322
More than anything,

1665
01:52:24,518 --> 01:52:27,764
I wanted to have a conversation with you.

1666
01:52:29,698 --> 01:52:32,557
I wasn't trying to hurt you.

1667
01:52:34,041 --> 01:52:36,310
But I must have, because...

1668
01:52:36,533 --> 01:52:39,208
I made you feel so bad about yourself

1669
01:52:39,474 --> 01:52:42,078
that you decided to go and do the unthinkable.

1670
01:52:42,551 --> 01:52:44,998
No, you're wrong!

1671
01:52:45,023 --> 01:52:47,159
It's because I couldn't change!

1672
01:52:47,184 --> 01:52:48,785
And that's why you fell.

1673
01:52:48,931 --> 01:52:50,058
It's me.

1674
01:52:50,589 --> 01:52:53,793
Everything is always my fault!

1675
01:52:54,801 --> 01:52:58,193
So I thought I should just disappear.

1676
01:52:58,218 --> 01:53:00,120
I was so selfish.

1677
01:53:02,577 --> 01:53:03,893
I'm sorry!

1678
01:53:03,918 --> 01:53:06,452
Please, that's not true. Don't cry.

1679
01:53:09,609 --> 01:53:12,259
Shoko, look at me.

1680
01:53:17,288 --> 01:53:19,856
Did you know we were talking a little while ago?

1681
01:53:20,870 --> 01:53:21,871
I was dreaming.

1682
01:53:22,722 --> 01:53:26,259
And in this dream, I was ready
to just give up on everything.

1683
01:53:27,141 --> 01:53:28,180
I was wrong.

1684
01:53:29,136 --> 01:53:30,217
To be honest,

1685
01:53:31,071 --> 01:53:34,135
I've thought about ending things, just like you did.

1686
01:53:35,211 --> 01:53:37,185
But then I realized something.

1687
01:53:38,212 --> 01:53:41,401
Even though certain things can
make life difficult sometimes,

1688
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:45,093
that doesn't mean that they're worth dying over.

1689
01:53:46,813 --> 01:53:50,203
I want to apologize and make sure I do it right.

1690
01:53:52,412 --> 01:53:53,339
Shoko?

1691
01:53:54,397 --> 01:53:56,250
I need some help from you.

1692
01:54:00,258 --> 01:54:01,391
I was hoping...

1693
01:54:02,323 --> 01:54:03,672
that maybe you could...

1694
01:54:04,808 --> 01:54:06,194
teach me how to live.

1695
01:54:14,776 --> 01:54:15,887
Please, Shoko.

1696
01:54:37,685 --> 01:54:38,471
Oh, God.

1697
01:54:40,410 --> 01:54:42,727
That's the creepiest thing I've ever said in my life.

1698
01:54:43,766 --> 01:54:45,704
I'm so sorry, just... never mind.

1699
01:54:45,910 --> 01:54:48,564
Forget everything I said, okay? I didn't mean it.

1700
01:55:11,911 --> 01:55:14,926
You have arrived at your destination.

1701
01:55:15,193 --> 01:55:16,493
Hey there, Maria.

1702
01:55:16,518 --> 01:55:19,075
You've become quite the gardener
since I've been gone, huh?

1703
01:55:19,202 --> 01:55:20,419
They're lookin' good.

1704
01:55:21,595 --> 01:55:22,669
Sho-Sho!

1705
01:55:23,299 --> 01:55:24,684
You died!

1706
01:55:24,924 --> 01:55:25,559
You died!

1707
01:55:25,583 --> 01:55:27,117
That's right, Maria.

1708
01:55:27,142 --> 01:55:28,640
Our Sho came back from the dead.

1709
01:55:28,665 --> 01:55:31,128
Don't listen to Grandma. I wasn't really dead.

1710
01:55:31,187 --> 01:55:33,501
Hey look. Isn't that Naoka?

1711
01:55:35,108 --> 01:55:38,849
You know, she was by your side
the entire time you were in a coma.

1712
01:55:39,047 --> 01:55:40,827
You really should thank her.

1713
01:55:43,230 --> 01:55:45,353
My mom said you came to the hospital.

1714
01:55:45,549 --> 01:55:48,508
Listen, I really suck at life sometimes.

1715
01:55:48,942 --> 01:55:51,578
Especially when it comes to stuff like this.

1716
01:55:52,128 --> 01:55:53,005
I just...

1717
01:55:53,393 --> 01:55:55,968
I just can't bring myself to like Shoko.

1718
01:55:56,900 --> 01:55:58,730
I'm probably gonna regret this.

1719
01:55:59,288 --> 01:56:01,538
Remember when you fell in the river?

1720
01:56:01,734 --> 01:56:04,777
It was Kazuki and the guys who pulled you out.

1721
01:56:05,235 --> 01:56:07,495
And then told me not to tell you but...

1722
01:56:08,325 --> 01:56:09,522
Anyway.

1723
01:56:11,067 --> 01:56:12,305
Welcome back.

1724
01:56:12,761 --> 01:56:14,458
Well, I'm gonna take off.

1725
01:56:15,674 --> 01:56:16,942
Thanks, Naoka.

1726
01:56:26,221 --> 01:56:27,356
I don't know.

1727
01:56:27,381 --> 01:56:29,264
Don't you think it's a little short?

1728
01:56:29,289 --> 01:56:31,917
No, no, it looks much cuter like this!

1729
01:56:31,942 --> 01:56:33,410
Oh, you're home, Shoya.

1730
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:34,799
Oh, hi, Shoya.

1731
01:56:34,823 --> 01:56:36,501
Uh, Mrs. Nishimiya.

1732
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:39,142
Wait a minute.

1733
01:56:39,238 --> 01:56:40,085
Yes?

1734
01:56:41,222 --> 01:56:42,415
I'm really sorry.

1735
01:56:42,513 --> 01:56:44,748
Uh, yeah. Me too.

1736
01:56:44,904 --> 01:56:47,470
No matter what, my son always bounces right back.

1737
01:56:47,495 --> 01:56:48,302
See ya later, Mom.

1738
01:56:48,327 --> 01:56:49,935
I'm heading out to pick up Maria now.

1739
01:56:50,057 --> 01:56:51,011
Okay!

1740
01:56:51,196 --> 01:56:51,816
Who's that?

1741
01:56:51,841 --> 01:56:54,782
That's my son-in-law. He's back from being deployed.

1742
01:56:54,807 --> 01:56:55,822
Oh, Shoya.

1743
01:56:56,189 --> 01:56:58,124
Yuzuru is waiting for you upstairs.

1744
01:56:58,220 --> 01:56:59,919
Give her the jelly that's in the fridge.

1745
01:57:01,457 --> 01:57:01,974
Yo.

1746
01:57:01,998 --> 01:57:02,972
Whoa.

1747
01:57:03,397 --> 01:57:04,441
New threads?

1748
01:57:04,466 --> 01:57:05,597
It looks good on you.

1749
01:57:05,780 --> 01:57:07,170
Check it out. I won.

1750
01:57:07,314 --> 01:57:08,619
Huh? Wow!

1751
01:57:08,644 --> 01:57:10,326
No kidding. Impressive.

1752
01:57:10,351 --> 01:57:11,861
Now feast your eyes on this.

1753
01:57:11,885 --> 01:57:12,668
Whoa.

1754
01:57:13,033 --> 01:57:14,411
Not so impressive.

1755
01:57:14,436 --> 01:57:15,698
Since you're alive again,

1756
01:57:15,723 --> 01:57:18,319
will you please help teach me how to study?

1757
01:57:18,344 --> 01:57:19,650
Of course, no prob.

1758
01:57:23,272 --> 01:57:25,737
So, uh, you're giving school another shot?

1759
01:57:25,878 --> 01:57:28,901
Yeah, I decided to take a cue from Shoko.

1760
01:57:30,189 --> 01:57:33,168
I figured the least I can do is try.

1761
01:57:33,767 --> 01:57:35,579
I don't wanna let anyone down.

1762
01:57:37,826 --> 01:57:40,241
Isn't your big school festival tomorrow?

1763
01:57:40,266 --> 01:57:41,461
Oh yeah, that's right.

1764
01:57:50,750 --> 01:57:52,947
Ah, good morning, everybody!

1765
01:57:52,972 --> 01:57:54,333
Up top, yeah!

1766
01:57:54,644 --> 01:57:55,815
Ha, ha, ha!

1767
01:57:56,218 --> 01:57:58,772
I said horrible things and I'm sorry.

1768
01:58:06,957 --> 01:58:07,588
Okay.

1769
01:58:08,230 --> 01:58:09,158
I'm heading out.

1770
01:58:09,182 --> 01:58:10,677
Have a good day, sweetheart.

1771
01:58:10,702 --> 01:58:14,482
Oh, I see now. So that's what you're
supposed to do with those things.

1772
01:58:14,507 --> 01:58:15,324
What's that?

1773
01:58:15,349 --> 01:58:17,471
Oh, nothing. I'll see you later, 'kay?

1774
01:58:17,852 --> 01:58:20,034
Have a good day, Sho-Sho!

1775
01:58:34,863 --> 01:58:36,615
Ha! There you are.

1776
01:58:40,128 --> 01:58:41,447
Okay, let's go.

1777
01:58:50,839 --> 01:58:52,258
Isn't that Shoya?

1778
01:58:53,185 --> 01:58:54,026
Who is that?

1779
01:58:54,051 --> 01:58:55,916
Wait the one who was in the hospital, right?

1780
01:58:55,941 --> 01:58:57,101
The guy who jumped?

1781
01:59:02,389 --> 01:59:04,649
You probably didn't know this, but I...

1782
01:59:05,734 --> 01:59:07,560
don't really fit in at school.

1783
01:59:10,501 --> 01:59:12,615
It's cause I have trouble

1784
01:59:12,965 --> 01:59:14,702
looking people in the eye.

1785
01:59:15,650 --> 01:59:19,281
So it's easier for me to just
stare at the floor all the time.

1786
01:59:22,395 --> 01:59:24,388
You think it's okay to do that?

1787
01:59:26,688 --> 01:59:28,307
Uh, Shoko.

1788
01:59:28,648 --> 01:59:31,424
I can actually do it without you leading me.

1789
01:59:31,923 --> 01:59:32,872
But thank you.

1790
01:59:33,926 --> 01:59:35,502
This is my classroom here.

1791
01:59:37,323 --> 01:59:38,987
Has the water boiled yet?

1792
01:59:39,011 --> 01:59:40,345
Just a few more minutes.

1793
01:59:41,173 --> 01:59:43,920
Oh, wow. Shoya's back at school!

1794
01:59:43,945 --> 01:59:45,338
Are you okay now?

1795
01:59:47,425 --> 01:59:48,862
You know what?

1796
01:59:49,385 --> 01:59:52,229
I think my stomach's acting up a bit.

1797
01:59:52,359 --> 01:59:54,889
So, sorry.

1798
01:59:54,914 --> 01:59:57,010
Yasho! Huh?

1799
02:00:09,302 --> 02:00:10,303
Yasho?

1800
02:00:10,691 --> 02:00:13,737
Huh? Oh, hey. That you, Nagatsuka?

1801
02:00:13,802 --> 02:00:15,558
You feeling okay?

1802
02:00:18,523 --> 02:00:19,625
Yasho.

1803
02:00:20,108 --> 02:00:22,382
Good morning, Nagatsuka. Good to see you.

1804
02:00:22,407 --> 02:00:23,722
So how is everything?

1805
02:00:23,823 --> 02:00:24,743
About the...?

1806
02:00:24,767 --> 02:00:25,615
What's going on?

1807
02:00:25,877 --> 02:00:27,102
Why won't you look at me?

1808
02:00:27,269 --> 02:00:29,540
I don't know. I just feel weird.

1809
02:00:30,219 --> 02:00:33,595
I made myself a promise I would
look people in the eyes from now on.

1810
02:00:34,203 --> 02:00:35,476
Guess I'm too chicken.

1811
02:00:35,594 --> 02:00:37,231
Hey, Yasho.

1812
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:38,877
Shoya!

1813
02:00:39,864 --> 02:00:43,430
You're okay. I'm glad.

1814
02:00:43,878 --> 02:00:46,886
'Cause if you... if you didn't wake up,

1815
02:00:46,911 --> 02:00:48,732
I didn't know what I would do!

1816
02:00:48,757 --> 02:00:50,498
You're everything to me.

1817
02:00:50,523 --> 02:00:52,320
I would have been all alone.

1818
02:00:52,599 --> 02:00:56,283
Listen, the stuff on the bridge,
don't worry about it, 'kay?

1819
02:00:56,676 --> 02:01:00,400
Friends say stuff they don't mean to
each other all the time. It doesn't matter.

1820
02:01:01,095 --> 02:01:04,310
I'm begging you, don't ever leave us again.

1821
02:01:04,738 --> 02:01:06,871
Promise me. I can't lose you.

1822
02:01:06,896 --> 02:01:08,077
It's gonna be okay.

1823
02:01:09,978 --> 02:01:10,892
Hey, look.

1824
02:01:11,396 --> 02:01:12,352
I'm sorry.

1825
02:01:13,015 --> 02:01:13,903
I mean...

1826
02:01:15,096 --> 02:01:15,971
Thank you.

1827
02:01:16,891 --> 02:01:17,984
For being a friend.

1828
02:01:18,531 --> 02:01:19,706
You've very welcome.

1829
02:01:19,731 --> 02:01:20,910
But, uh...

1830
02:01:21,246 --> 02:01:22,634
What's up with the facial hair?

1831
02:01:22,897 --> 02:01:24,622
That's my lucky 'stache.

1832
02:01:24,647 --> 02:01:27,623
I swore I wasn't shaving it till you woke up.

1833
02:01:27,764 --> 02:01:29,123
You did that for me?

1834
02:01:33,714 --> 02:01:34,374
Uh.

1835
02:01:35,385 --> 02:01:36,527
What's going on?

1836
02:01:36,552 --> 02:01:39,302
We heard Nagatsuka howling your name, so we followed it.

1837
02:01:41,721 --> 02:01:42,548
I-I see.

1838
02:01:43,344 --> 02:01:45,902
Miki, did you bring the stuff to give to Shoya?

1839
02:01:47,567 --> 02:01:50,135
I brought them, but I can't give it to him.

1840
02:01:50,160 --> 02:01:51,625
It's a total failure.

1841
02:01:51,650 --> 02:01:53,518
Don't be silly, hand 'em over.

1842
02:01:59,923 --> 02:02:00,789
Here.

1843
02:02:01,001 --> 02:02:01,848
Hm?

1844
02:02:02,167 --> 02:02:04,343
There was supposed to be a thousand of them,

1845
02:02:04,440 --> 02:02:06,632
but we couldn't finish it fast enough.

1846
02:02:07,166 --> 02:02:11,721
Everyone worked really hard and
did their best, but we just couldn't.

1847
02:02:11,746 --> 02:02:13,428
No, this is amazing!

1848
02:02:13,453 --> 02:02:14,690
It's more than enough.

1849
02:02:14,777 --> 02:02:17,006
No one's ever done anything like this for me.

1850
02:02:17,074 --> 02:02:18,975
It really means a lot, seriously.

1851
02:02:19,428 --> 02:02:20,847
Thank you, Miki.

1852
02:02:21,133 --> 02:02:22,736
Also, sorry.

1853
02:02:23,175 --> 02:02:24,306
And to you, too.

1854
02:02:24,667 --> 02:02:26,930
No worries. It's all good, bro.

1855
02:02:27,835 --> 02:02:30,993
Ugh, enough! All this sappy talk.

1856
02:02:31,276 --> 02:02:32,550
I'm gonna lose my lunch.

1857
02:02:32,575 --> 02:02:35,003
Why do you always have to be like that, Naoka?

1858
02:02:35,334 --> 02:02:37,900
What, you got a problem with me or something?

1859
02:02:37,925 --> 02:02:38,883
You pickin' a fight?

1860
02:02:38,908 --> 02:02:41,152
Okay, everybody just calm down.

1861
02:02:41,962 --> 02:02:42,852
Shoya.

1862
02:02:43,323 --> 02:02:45,187
Listen, I'm really sorry.

1863
02:02:45,561 --> 02:02:48,477
After all you'd been through, you really needed a friend.

1864
02:02:49,389 --> 02:02:51,096
But all I did was run away.

1865
02:02:52,526 --> 02:02:53,396
That's okay.

1866
02:02:54,286 --> 02:02:55,504
I did the same thing.

1867
02:02:57,033 --> 02:03:00,191
Stop acting so worried. They're just talking things out.

1868
02:03:02,696 --> 02:03:04,001
You apologizing?

1869
02:03:05,387 --> 02:03:08,173
Well, guess that's all you know how to do.

1870
02:03:08,846 --> 02:03:10,848
Moron.

1871
02:03:15,263 --> 02:03:16,829
Moron.

1872
02:03:17,613 --> 02:03:18,704
Moron.

1873
02:03:19,291 --> 02:03:19,876
Mm.

1874
02:03:26,040 --> 02:03:28,344
Whatever. I'm gonna go find something to eat.

1875
02:03:28,369 --> 02:03:29,802
Did she just run away?

1876
02:03:29,827 --> 02:03:31,229
I think she's embarrassed.

1877
02:03:34,266 --> 02:03:37,343
Hey, guys. I have a big favor to ask all of you.

1878
02:03:38,169 --> 02:03:38,900
That okay?

1879
02:03:40,585 --> 02:03:43,470
Do you wanna go together to the festival?

1880
02:03:43,783 --> 02:03:44,745
How's that sound?

1881
02:04:03,437 --> 02:04:06,282
OMG, this is so good!

1882
02:04:06,307 --> 02:04:08,484
Oh, hey, let's go to the gym next.

1883
02:04:08,668 --> 02:04:10,365
I can't believe he's back in school.

1884
02:04:10,585 --> 02:04:13,121
Oh, their store's amazing.
