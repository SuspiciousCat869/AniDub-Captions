1
00:00:18,265 --> 00:00:25,083
Good evening, ya buncha filthy jailbirds.
Rattling in your cages, just waiting to die.

2
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:28,674
Since you ain't got nothin' better to do,

3
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:31,908
whaddaya say to a good, old- fashioned fight to the death?

4
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,087
And I'll be your judge... right here, right now!

5
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:38,470
Whoever's left alive gets to see the outside world again,

6
00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:42,133
sailing the sweet seas of freedom as a member of my crew!

7
00:00:57,134 --> 00:00:57,776
Huh?

8
00:01:08,954 --> 00:01:11,409
Take the others but leave that one.

9
00:01:13,422 --> 00:01:15,285
So he's still alive, huh?

10
00:01:16,697 --> 00:01:20,014
The man they call the "Demon Heir."

11
00:01:33,196 --> 00:01:36,268
Wealth, fame, power.

12
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:38,947
Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates,

13
00:01:39,029 --> 00:01:42,702
attained this and everything else the world had to offer.

14
00:01:42,988 --> 00:01:47,613
And his dying words drove countless souls to the seas.

15
00:01:47,697 --> 00:01:50,238
"Ya want my treasure? You can have it!

16
00:01:50,321 --> 00:01:52,822
I left everything I gathered together in one place.

17
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:55,447
Now ya just have to find it!"

18
00:01:55,905 --> 00:01:59,707
And thus, began the time known as the Great Pirate Era.

19
00:02:00,446 --> 00:02:04,275
It still haunts me. That was the day that I died.

20
00:02:04,405 --> 00:02:05,577
Same as you.

21
00:02:06,363 --> 00:02:07,413
Am I right?

22
00:02:09,988 --> 00:02:14,245
But now, together, we can take our lives back.

23
00:02:16,488 --> 00:02:20,331
I, Buena Festa, have happened upon a deep secret.

24
00:02:20,988 --> 00:02:24,295
Gold Roger's hidden treasure is within my grasp!

25
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:28,562
You follow me, and you'll have everything you desire.

26
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,435
I guarantee it.

27
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:32,390
So let's do this!

28
00:02:32,555 --> 00:02:35,878
We'll usher in a new era with the
greatest party the world has ever seen!

29
00:02:35,978 --> 00:02:38,062
Made by pirates for pirates!

30
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:41,590
Yeah, we're bringing the Pirates Fest back, baby.

31
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,031
Ahem.

32
00:02:45,182 --> 00:02:48,051
"My dearest pirates, hailing from far and wide,

33
00:02:48,154 --> 00:02:50,910
you are cordially invited to the world's largest banquet,

34
00:02:50,947 --> 00:02:54,120
where we shall share a toast
between allies and enemies alike.

35
00:02:54,172 --> 00:02:55,915
Come as you are, leave as you like,

36
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:58,791
but you won't want to miss the one and only Pirates Fest.

37
00:02:58,816 --> 00:03:03,074
Sincerely, Buena Festa, Captain of the Festival Pirates."

38
00:03:05,113 --> 00:03:06,830
It's party time!

39
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:09,930
We're almost there!

40
00:03:11,313 --> 00:03:14,321
I've heard whispers of this
event, but never attended myself.

41
00:03:14,405 --> 00:03:18,757
Every few years, the invitations appear quite
suddenly and then it's off to a world of rare ships,

42
00:03:18,822 --> 00:03:21,482
fine cuisine, deadly weapons, and secret intel!

43
00:03:21,605 --> 00:03:25,144
Every wonder you could dream of gathered
together from all corners of the world!

44
00:03:25,231 --> 00:03:28,147
Like a pirate black market? I'm down with that!

45
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:30,172
Bet they'll have some good booze, too.

46
00:03:30,197 --> 00:03:33,271
"Also, we have a special event planned this year."

47
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,616
Oh, boy! Is it a treasure hunt?

48
00:03:35,797 --> 00:03:39,486
That it is, my friend. Featuring
a lost relic from Gold Roger!

49
00:03:40,005 --> 00:03:41,588
And it's gonna be ours!

50
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:44,113
This really is the ultimate party!

51
00:03:44,618 --> 00:03:46,921
They sent us this Eternal Pose,

52
00:03:47,172 --> 00:03:50,942
but why should I believe it's leading
us to a party and not some elaborate trap?

53
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:52,967
And as for this Gold Roger thing.

54
00:03:53,029 --> 00:03:54,363
The treasure hunt?

55
00:03:54,406 --> 00:03:56,678
Yeah! It's too good to be true!

56
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,116
Buena Festa was the king of all parties.

57
00:03:59,185 --> 00:04:01,922
A famous pirate said to hold many dark secrets.

58
00:04:01,947 --> 00:04:05,655
His network of merchants and informants
would make this festival possible,

59
00:04:05,761 --> 00:04:08,445
but it could also just be an imposter using his name.

60
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:10,831
The man is long dead, after all.

61
00:04:10,971 --> 00:04:14,006
A dead man and the Pirate King's lost treasure.

62
00:04:14,174 --> 00:04:16,581
Well, we'll figure it out soon enough.

63
00:04:16,697 --> 00:04:18,217
Luffy's all fired up.

64
00:04:18,423 --> 00:04:19,997
So we're going.

65
00:04:20,838 --> 00:04:23,630
A treasure hunt with pirates is gonna be crazy!

66
00:04:23,678 --> 00:04:24,886
Who cares if it's a trap?

67
00:04:24,947 --> 00:04:26,845
It's time to party!

68
00:04:27,012 --> 00:04:30,269
Full speed ahead to the pirate festival!

69
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:09,008
Marvelous.

70
00:06:11,594 --> 00:06:14,578
The stars of the show are finally starting to line up.

71
00:06:16,414 --> 00:06:18,368
Excuse me, Mr. Festa.

72
00:06:18,873 --> 00:06:19,520
Huh?

73
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,759
Huh? Huh?

74
00:06:31,863 --> 00:06:34,004
Monkey D. Luffy.

75
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,561
Havin' fun already, huh?

76
00:06:38,222 --> 00:06:40,734
That's good. I want everyone fired up.

77
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,807
We're celebrating the start of a new era, after all!

78
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,121
Hello, party pirates!

79
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:51,952
Are you having fun at our pirate festival, or what?!

80
00:06:56,831 --> 00:06:58,630
Now here's a quick little disclaimer.

81
00:06:58,655 --> 00:07:00,338
I'm sure this comes as no surprise,

82
00:07:00,363 --> 00:07:02,787
but anything goes as long as you're here!

83
00:07:02,863 --> 00:07:06,004
That goes for fights, kidnapping,
stealing or whatever else!

84
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:09,556
The only rule is that you gotta
keep this party secret from the Navy!

85
00:07:09,655 --> 00:07:11,546
Anyone who spills their guts

86
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:15,507
will be branded the enemy of all pirates,
and we'll chase you to the gates of hell itself

87
00:07:15,571 --> 00:07:17,129
to take our sweet revenge!

88
00:07:17,154 --> 00:07:18,863
Whoo. Scary!

89
00:07:18,947 --> 00:07:21,022
Oh, forgot to introduce myself.

90
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,231
The name is Donald Moderate.

91
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,113
I'll be your host and MC today!

92
00:07:25,172 --> 00:07:26,209
And with me

93
00:07:26,353 --> 00:07:29,922
is the lovely, talented and
widely beloved songstress, Ann!

94
00:07:29,947 --> 00:07:32,137
Hi, everybody!

95
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,879
Oh. If you didn't know, she has Devil Fruit Powers.

96
00:07:35,947 --> 00:07:38,040
Viso-Viso Vision!

97
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:39,984
Fire! Fire!

98
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:46,770
The Viso Viso Fruit allows her to transform any image
she touches into a giant-sized, fully functional illusion.

99
00:07:46,897 --> 00:07:48,296
For a short time, at least.

100
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:49,630
Cool, huh?

101
00:07:49,655 --> 00:07:54,071
Now, it's been 20 long years since the last
Pirates Fest, so you might be wondering why

102
00:07:54,096 --> 00:07:55,380
we brought it back today

103
00:07:55,405 --> 00:07:57,910
and why we decided on this particular island.

104
00:07:57,947 --> 00:08:00,947
It's said that just before the
dawn of the Great Pirate Era,

105
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:03,488
Gold Roger, the famous King of the Pirates,

106
00:08:03,571 --> 00:08:08,261
discovered this place and hid an invaluable
treasure here for the next generation to find.

107
00:08:08,398 --> 00:08:10,382
He left us with this hint:

108
00:08:11,206 --> 00:08:14,721
"In a deep, lofty darkness, you will find your answer."

109
00:08:14,863 --> 00:08:16,460
Intriguing!

110
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:18,922
So there you have it, my friends!

111
00:08:18,947 --> 00:08:21,279
A challenge from the King of the Pirates himself!

112
00:08:21,363 --> 00:08:23,797
We've got a powerful lineup of competitors here today,

113
00:08:23,822 --> 00:08:26,765
so let's solve the mystery and find that treasure!

114
00:08:33,655 --> 00:08:36,304
Hey, hurry! Something's happening!

115
00:08:36,336 --> 00:08:38,044
We're late for the party!

116
00:08:38,076 --> 00:08:39,767
Yeah? And who's fault is that?

117
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:43,048
I told you shopaholics the treasure
hunt was about to start without us.

118
00:08:43,113 --> 00:08:45,415
But you just had to keep stuffing your dumb faces!

119
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,066
You were shopping, too!

120
00:08:47,322 --> 00:08:49,630
But anyway, judging by the turnout,

121
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:52,015
it looks like this treasure could be the real deal!

122
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,890
All right, then! It's time for a fight!

123
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,038
Don't you worry, my friends!

124
00:08:58,154 --> 00:09:01,065
When it comes to finding hidden
treasure, I've got a sixth sense!

125
00:09:01,113 --> 00:09:02,463
Assist me, Chopper!

126
00:09:02,547 --> 00:09:03,765
Yes, sir!

127
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,870
Let 'em have their fun for now.

128
00:09:05,988 --> 00:09:09,074
Yes. Until they take a good look at the competition.

129
00:09:09,912 --> 00:09:12,522
Before long, this place is gonna be a blood bath.

130
00:09:12,547 --> 00:09:14,022
Hey, Captain!

131
00:09:14,113 --> 00:09:16,962
The Sunny's ready to take off
as soon as you give the word!

132
00:09:16,987 --> 00:09:19,131
Any second now, Franky!

133
00:09:19,196 --> 00:09:21,928
My "Can't Go On Treasure Hunts" disease is flaring up.

134
00:09:21,953 --> 00:09:23,779
Do I need to operate?

135
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:27,213
What were you doing?

136
00:09:27,238 --> 00:09:28,354
Picking your butts?

137
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:30,955
How could you let this happen, you buncha morons?!

138
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:33,884
Don't pin this on me! He was slacking off!

139
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:35,838
I was with you the entire time!

140
00:09:35,863 --> 00:09:37,882
Less shifting blame and more searching!

141
00:09:37,987 --> 00:09:40,042
You're the one who's running security here!

142
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:40,995
Indeed!

143
00:09:41,076 --> 00:09:43,729
Who could possibly be more dependable than me?

144
00:09:43,806 --> 00:09:46,421
Why, I'm a Warlord of the Sea, after all!

145
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:49,118
A living legend known as the Genius Jester,

146
00:09:49,148 --> 00:09:52,056
the one and only, Captain Buggy!

147
00:09:52,148 --> 00:09:54,505
We had 200 security pirates on the job!

148
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,766
Can't they catch one annoying little rodent?

149
00:09:58,436 --> 00:10:00,079
They're gonna dock our pay if he escapes!

150
00:10:00,104 --> 00:10:03,088
Search harder! And be flashy about it!

151
00:10:03,163 --> 00:10:06,473
I knew this wouldn't be easy, but
things are spinning out of control.

152
00:10:07,738 --> 00:10:08,738
That's Straw Hat's ship.

153
00:10:08,822 --> 00:10:10,027
Ah-ha!

154
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:13,077
You're mine now, Trafalgar Law!

155
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:14,246
Room!

156
00:10:14,738 --> 00:10:15,781
Shambles!

157
00:10:19,312 --> 00:10:20,434
He's gone!

158
00:10:23,238 --> 00:10:25,075
I don't know what I was expecting.

159
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:28,380
But even for a pirate festival, this is a lot of pirates.

160
00:10:28,405 --> 00:10:30,365
I wish I could arrest them all.

161
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:32,213
But that's not likely.

162
00:10:32,238 --> 00:10:35,060
As long as we can capture Buena Festa, we'll be good.

163
00:10:35,363 --> 00:10:38,296
He was a famous pirate way back in Gold Roger's day,

164
00:10:38,321 --> 00:10:40,416
but we thought he'd been swallowed by a Sea King.

165
00:10:40,738 --> 00:10:42,926
This guy is the one who worries me.

166
00:10:43,012 --> 00:10:46,088
Navy Headquarters won't even admit he's alive.

167
00:10:46,571 --> 00:10:47,905
Douglas Bullet.

168
00:10:47,988 --> 00:10:50,991
An escapee from Level 6 of Impel Down.

169
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,811
I don't know what he and Festa want,

170
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:56,506
but something bad's going down at this party.

171
00:10:57,538 --> 00:10:58,633
What's that?

172
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,184
Something's happening!

173
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:03,188
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

174
00:11:03,213 --> 00:11:06,548
Turn the ship around right now! We are done!

175
00:11:06,838 --> 00:11:07,365
Hold on.

176
00:11:07,674 --> 00:11:08,424
Is that...?

177
00:11:08,492 --> 00:11:09,845
Look at the current!

178
00:11:11,553 --> 00:11:12,665
Uh-oh!

179
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,046
Seems like things are getting crazy already!

180
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,433
But what the heck is going on?

181
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:22,915
Wait. Could it be? The answer to Roger's riddle?

182
00:11:22,988 --> 00:11:26,259
"In a deep, lofty darkness, you will find your answer."

183
00:11:26,498 --> 00:11:29,573
Those ships are definitely falling into a deep darkness.

184
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,568
But the lofty part is... a waterspout?!

185
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:41,630
Would you look at that!

186
00:11:41,655 --> 00:11:43,045
Well, there you have it!

187
00:11:43,071 --> 00:11:46,788
From the darkness of the deep
sea, it climbs to the heavens above!

188
00:11:48,368 --> 00:11:49,672
Awesome!

189
00:11:49,697 --> 00:11:51,475
It's the shooting sea current!

190
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:54,029
A Knock-Up Stream!

191
00:11:56,905 --> 00:11:58,016
And what's this?

192
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,209
There's some bubbles, but I don't know why.

193
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:04,630
Something big is coming!

194
00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:06,794
Something very, very big!

195
00:12:07,462 --> 00:12:09,907
I-I can't believe it!

196
00:12:11,176 --> 00:12:13,452
It's an island!

197
00:12:13,593 --> 00:12:16,717
Or rather, a giant bubble with an island inside of it!

198
00:12:17,312 --> 00:12:18,560
How pretty!

199
00:12:18,585 --> 00:12:20,752
There's no way this is a mere coincidence!

200
00:12:20,797 --> 00:12:23,667
Roger's treasure lies on the island in the sky!

201
00:12:23,774 --> 00:12:25,273
The question is,

202
00:12:25,364 --> 00:12:28,769
how are these courageous pirate
competitors going to make there?

203
00:12:29,555 --> 00:12:31,213
Let's go, Franky!

204
00:12:31,238 --> 00:12:32,789
I thought you'd never ask!

205
00:12:32,928 --> 00:12:36,198
Time for my secret weapon! Would you like to see it?

206
00:12:36,446 --> 00:12:37,922
You bet I would!

207
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:40,948
Better get out of my way!

208
00:12:42,894 --> 00:12:44,144
What's that I see?

209
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:48,375
Why, it's the infamous Kid Pirates from the
Worst Generation, shooting to the head of the pack!

210
00:12:48,421 --> 00:12:50,880
Their captain, Eustass Kid, and his crewmate,

211
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:54,596
"The Massacre Soldier," Killer,
are a force to be reckoned with!

212
00:12:54,755 --> 00:12:57,588
Things are about to start heating up for our competitors!

213
00:12:57,613 --> 00:13:00,421
This is the greatest treasure
hunt the world has ever seen!

214
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,933
Nuh-uh! 'Cause this isn't a
treasure hunt, it's a treasure fight!

215
00:13:04,188 --> 00:13:06,274
Go crazy!

216
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,996
I'm surprised you're buying into this, Kid.

217
00:13:14,113 --> 00:13:17,157
You expect me to lose?

218
00:13:17,655 --> 00:13:18,834
A-pa-pa!

219
00:13:18,947 --> 00:13:22,672
But Captain Kid's not the only one
with his eyes on the prize in this battle!

220
00:13:22,697 --> 00:13:25,254
The On-Air Pirates are grooving their way to the lead!

221
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,279
And there's their captain, Scratchman Apoo!

222
00:13:28,363 --> 00:13:31,005
Yo! What's the big hurry? Hm?

223
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,189
Uh-oh! Better look out!

224
00:13:33,238 --> 00:13:35,255
The Drake Pirates are comin' in hot!

225
00:13:35,305 --> 00:13:37,671
The X Drake is taking no prisoners!

226
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:40,915
Huh. The Red Flag, and the Sea Roar, too.

227
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:44,304
Next up is the only female
captain in the Worst Generation!

228
00:13:44,363 --> 00:13:47,093
Leading the Bonney Pirates, it's Bonney the Glutton!

229
00:13:47,154 --> 00:13:48,902
Gimme more pizza, now!

230
00:13:49,892 --> 00:13:51,476
Hey, watch it, you dumb oaf!

231
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:54,506
Pardon me, young lady, I didn't see you there.

232
00:13:55,113 --> 00:13:58,039
The Fallen Monk Pirates have muscled their way in!

233
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,875
And there's their captain, Urouge!

234
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:01,764
Yikes!

235
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:06,833
It's a surprise attack from the Firetank
Pirates, lead by their captain, Capone "Gang" Bege!

236
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:09,208
I got a whole stinkin' army here.

237
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,664
And the Hawkins Pirates are right behind!

238
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:14,501
Is he reading fortunes in the middle of a battle?

239
00:14:14,691 --> 00:14:18,412
If you dare lay a finger on
Mister Luffy, you're gonna die!

240
00:14:18,488 --> 00:14:21,135
Everyone, look! Pay attention to me, too!

241
00:14:21,196 --> 00:14:23,120
Hey! Save some intros for me!

242
00:14:23,145 --> 00:14:23,622
Fine!

243
00:14:23,647 --> 00:14:28,770
The next two, neck and neck, are Bartolomeo
the Cannibal and Cavendish the White Horse!

244
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:30,527
And right behind them...

245
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,562
Eh, looks like a bunch of nobodies.

246
00:14:33,738 --> 00:14:34,944
You've never heard of us?!

247
00:14:34,969 --> 00:14:38,546
The pirates have reached the Knock-Up
Stream and they're racing to the skies,

248
00:14:38,571 --> 00:14:40,808
but what awaits them on the floating island?

249
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:42,029
The treasure.

250
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,464
It's up in the sky?

251
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:44,468
Keep watching.

252
00:14:44,571 --> 00:14:46,255
You can handle things from here.

253
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:49,067
Report the situation via Transponder Snail.

254
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:50,569
Wait, where are you going?

255
00:14:50,594 --> 00:14:53,741
I'm infiltrating Festa's hideout
while everyone's distracted.

256
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:56,562
We get the ringleader, we end this.

257
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,248
I kept you in suspense, didn't I?

258
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,067
Well, the wait is over!

259
00:15:02,275 --> 00:15:05,198
This is the Thousand Sunny's new flying equipment!

260
00:15:05,326 --> 00:15:07,874
The Emperor Penguin Form!

261
00:15:08,154 --> 00:15:09,249
So cool!

262
00:15:09,623 --> 00:15:12,086
Now, step on it! We have to catch up!

263
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,184
Not so fast, Straw Hats!

264
00:15:15,955 --> 00:15:18,129
Long time no see, rubber boy!

265
00:15:18,154 --> 00:15:20,296
Now hand Law over to me!

266
00:15:20,321 --> 00:15:21,721
Oh, it's you.

267
00:15:21,947 --> 00:15:23,732
Are you bros ready?

268
00:15:23,905 --> 00:15:26,759
Coup de Burst!

269
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:29,795
Buggy!

270
00:15:32,613 --> 00:15:35,522
Here we go!

271
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,731
They're flying!

272
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,235
The Straw Hat pirates are literally soaring to the lead!

273
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:45,517
No surprise, since their captain loves to make a scene!

274
00:15:45,822 --> 00:15:49,331
He's a man with a 1.5 billion bounty on his head...

275
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:52,421
...Monkey D. Luffy!

276
00:15:52,697 --> 00:15:57,463
With the Straw Hats flying into the fray, this high-speed
hunt for treasure is really starting to heat up!

277
00:15:57,488 --> 00:16:00,216
I'm cheering for you and your crew, Straw Hat!

278
00:16:00,655 --> 00:16:01,713
Mister Luffy!

279
00:16:01,738 --> 00:16:03,797
Don't steal the spotlight from me!

280
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:05,601
That's cheating, Straw Hat!

281
00:16:07,317 --> 00:16:10,266
We're blasting straight through! Let's go!

282
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,880
Marvelous.

283
00:16:35,748 --> 00:16:39,336
Now, friend, I think it's time for your part of the plan.

284
00:16:39,613 --> 00:16:41,338
You ready to party?

285
00:16:44,947 --> 00:16:46,100
Are you kidding me?

286
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:48,793
The Straw Hats have taken a decisive lead!

287
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:50,857
Can anybody stop them?

288
00:16:51,065 --> 00:16:53,933
Always gotta keep it interesting now, don'tcha?

289
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:55,922
Splashdown complete!

290
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:57,165
I wasn't scared.

291
00:16:57,336 --> 00:16:59,086
That move gave us a good lead.

292
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:01,201
But we'll have to watch out for attacks from behind now.

293
00:17:01,238 --> 00:17:02,880
Franky, that was too cool!

294
00:17:02,905 --> 00:17:04,473
That's the point, bro!

295
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,963
All right! Let's find us some hidden treasure!

296
00:17:06,988 --> 00:17:08,526
I'm so ready!

297
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,494
Is something the matter?

298
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:10,876
Huh?

299
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:11,624
Hm?

300
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:14,699
Traffy!

301
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,537
Hello, Straw Hat.

302
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:18,630
My first aid kit!

303
00:17:18,655 --> 00:17:19,711
What happened to you?

304
00:17:19,947 --> 00:17:20,838
We'll fix you up.

305
00:17:21,315 --> 00:17:22,531
No, don't bother.

306
00:17:22,613 --> 00:17:23,988
I'll be leaving here soon.

307
00:17:24,071 --> 00:17:27,378
And if you value your lives,
then you'll be doing the same thing.

308
00:17:29,238 --> 00:17:30,708
It's Festa. He...

309
00:17:31,337 --> 00:17:33,084
The man who's hosting this party?

310
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,411
Yeah, he's plotting something.

311
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:38,123
And he's got some dangerous friends helping him out.

312
00:17:39,154 --> 00:17:41,077
I've already evacuated my crew.

313
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,605
This whole island is about to become a war zone.

314
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:47,488
Well, you heard the man! It's time to go!

315
00:17:47,697 --> 00:17:48,958
Hey, take it easy!

316
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,088
Traffy, please, let me patch you up!

317
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:53,456
Forget I was here.

318
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,960
I don't need your help to see this through to the end.

319
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,152
Don't be ridiculous! Look at yourself!

320
00:17:58,212 --> 00:18:01,060
Don't worry. I'll make 'em pay for this.

321
00:18:02,344 --> 00:18:03,761
Jeez! That didn't take long!

322
00:18:03,806 --> 00:18:05,596
The guys behind us are catching up!

323
00:18:05,988 --> 00:18:07,582
What should we do now?

324
00:18:07,697 --> 00:18:09,179
We need a plan!

325
00:18:11,655 --> 00:18:13,390
We'll keep pushing forward!

326
00:18:13,613 --> 00:18:15,137
But we'll help Traffy, too.

327
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,727
Chopper, take good care of him.

328
00:18:17,988 --> 00:18:18,797
You got it!

329
00:18:18,822 --> 00:18:20,421
Hey, I said I'm leaving!

330
00:18:20,477 --> 00:18:21,602
Then I'll come with you.

331
00:18:22,428 --> 00:18:23,600
We shouldn't run away.

332
00:18:23,947 --> 00:18:26,546
You mentioned Festa's "dangerous friends," right?

333
00:18:26,571 --> 00:18:28,373
And some nefarious plot, as well?

334
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:31,727
If this is some sort of trap,
then lives could be at stake.

335
00:18:31,997 --> 00:18:34,196
Besides, you've piqued my curiousity.

336
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,731
Any objections?

337
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,797
I don't mind, as long as I can come as your bodyguard.

338
00:18:38,822 --> 00:18:41,475
If it's a covert mission, I might come in handy!

339
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:42,608
That works for me.

340
00:18:42,632 --> 00:18:43,142
Hold on!

341
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:44,672
Sounds like my kinda party.

342
00:18:44,697 --> 00:18:46,163
And my nightmare!

343
00:18:46,188 --> 00:18:48,625
I was promised treasure, so keep your eyes peeled, 'kay?

344
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,458
Anything for you!

345
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:52,795
We're teamin' up again, huh?

346
00:18:54,365 --> 00:18:55,894
Not like I can stop you.

347
00:18:55,949 --> 00:18:57,767
You guys need a ride, right?

348
00:18:57,973 --> 00:18:59,182
I got your back.

349
00:19:04,281 --> 00:19:05,963
What happens when we land?

350
00:19:05,988 --> 00:19:07,380
Then we all die!

351
00:19:07,405 --> 00:19:09,798
Well, that's not anything new for me.

352
00:19:10,653 --> 00:19:12,721
Time for Mil Fleur!

353
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:21,986
Nice one, Robin. That was close.

354
00:19:22,154 --> 00:19:24,797
If anything happens, call us on the transponder snail.

355
00:19:24,822 --> 00:19:25,323
Roger.

356
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,164
Let me treat you first, Traffy.

357
00:19:27,189 --> 00:19:29,422
Sorry. There's no time.

358
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:31,408
We're heading underneath the island,

359
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,497
and putting a stop to Festa!

360
00:19:35,238 --> 00:19:36,621
The island's dead ahead!

361
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:39,806
I'm taking that hidden treasure and nobody can stop me!

362
00:19:39,932 --> 00:19:42,336
The competitors are pushing towards the finish line,

363
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:45,096
but it looks like the Straw Hats will maintain their lead!

364
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:47,982
That's it! Almost there!

365
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:50,755
But how are we supposed to land?!

366
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,122
Guess we'll just have to wait and see!

367
00:20:04,324 --> 00:20:06,463
They've reached the top of the Knock-Up stream,

368
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:07,771
high above the island!

369
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:10,588
Now they're coming down! What a sight!

370
00:20:10,613 --> 00:20:13,296
Pirate ships scattered across the sky like birds!

371
00:20:13,321 --> 00:20:16,345
But what happens next? Someone has to take the lead!

372
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:19,532
Ah-ha! There go the Straw Hats, hitting the bubble!

373
00:20:21,613 --> 00:20:22,922
And they're in!

374
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:25,163
Time to find that treasure!

375
00:20:26,035 --> 00:20:26,718
Ha!

376
00:20:30,588 --> 00:20:32,922
I see it! Far up on the ledge!

377
00:20:32,947 --> 00:20:35,634
It's a giant galleon, sparkling in the sun!

378
00:20:35,682 --> 00:20:37,953
Wait! Sparkling? Could it be?

379
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:40,588
Yes! It's overflowing with treasure!

380
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:42,960
Oodles of it! A veritable mountain!

381
00:20:44,358 --> 00:20:46,940
Mountains of treasure? Be still, my heart!

382
00:20:49,742 --> 00:20:50,626
You ready?

383
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:52,343
When am I not ready?

384
00:20:54,304 --> 00:20:55,846
That old chest looks fishy.

385
00:20:56,007 --> 00:20:57,760
That's the one we want, I'm sure of it!

386
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:01,162
I've got a nose for treasure, and that smells heavenly!

387
00:21:01,488 --> 00:21:05,031
Luffy! There's a little old wooden chest inside the ship!

388
00:21:05,156 --> 00:21:08,668
Forget the other stuff! That
has to be Gold Roger's treasure!

389
00:21:08,693 --> 00:21:09,772
Cool! Got it!

390
00:21:09,797 --> 00:21:12,809
Right! You heard her! Grab that prize!

391
00:21:12,883 --> 00:21:14,706
Go help them, you little coward!

392
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,019
...Don't be a fool!

393
00:21:16,173 --> 00:21:16,597
...Huh?

394
00:21:16,662 --> 00:21:19,890
I'm a sniper, remember? I'm here for support.

395
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,144
Yep. Coward.

396
00:21:22,821 --> 00:21:24,742
This just keeps getting better!

397
00:21:24,822 --> 00:21:25,880
Outta my way!

398
00:21:25,905 --> 00:21:27,085
Hurry to the ship!

399
00:21:27,488 --> 00:21:28,285
This is it!

400
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:31,447
The final stretch where the true
battle for the treasure begins!

401
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:37,803
You go on ahead!

402
00:21:37,828 --> 00:21:39,001
All right, thanks!

403
00:21:45,566 --> 00:21:47,046
Hope you're ready for a fight.

404
00:21:47,071 --> 00:21:49,068
Hello, Pirate Hunter.

405
00:21:51,235 --> 00:21:52,150
Boom!

406
00:21:56,446 --> 00:21:57,793
What's goin' down?

407
00:21:57,822 --> 00:21:58,833
Get outta my way!

408
00:21:58,863 --> 00:22:00,421
Boy, you're crazy, runnin' wild.

409
00:22:00,446 --> 00:22:02,472
I'm gonna put you in your place with style!

410
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,973
Better make this one quick!

411
00:22:04,017 --> 00:22:04,989
Too late!

412
00:22:05,414 --> 00:22:07,672
You keep fighting! Leave the treasure to me!

413
00:22:07,697 --> 00:22:08,675
Wait a sec!

414
00:22:13,988 --> 00:22:15,296
Don't wanna play fair?

415
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,110
This is a battle between pirates.

416
00:22:17,154 --> 00:22:18,588
There's no such thing as fair.

417
00:22:18,613 --> 00:22:20,612
All right, then. No mercy.

418
00:22:25,706 --> 00:22:28,169
Outta my way! Comin' through!

419
00:22:28,405 --> 00:22:30,137
Now Gum-Gum...

420
00:22:30,355 --> 00:22:32,361
...Elephant Gun!

421
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:38,380
Hey! Get back here!

422
00:22:38,405 --> 00:22:41,755
It's the strongest versus the
strongest in a battle of captains!

423
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,331
Who will lay claim... Uh!

424
00:22:43,411 --> 00:22:45,571
Who will lay claim to victory?

425
00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:46,954
Better not blink!

426
00:22:47,342 --> 00:22:49,123
Time to move out and surround 'em!

427
00:22:49,148 --> 00:22:50,083
C'mon, boys!

428
00:22:55,152 --> 00:22:56,542
Move it, chumps!

429
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:04,498
Uh?

430
00:23:04,538 --> 00:23:06,063
Like candy from a baby.

431
00:23:06,148 --> 00:23:08,359
Why you! Get down here!

432
00:23:08,947 --> 00:23:10,713
Captain, can you speed it up?

433
00:23:10,738 --> 00:23:15,160
If we attempt to steal it, our chances are 40 percent.

434
00:23:15,601 --> 00:23:17,678
Ya ready? Here we go!

435
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:20,858
Special Attack Green Star!

436
00:23:22,088 --> 00:23:23,736
Impact Wolf!

437
00:23:25,406 --> 00:23:28,085
Thunderbolt Tempo! Eat this!

438
00:23:30,488 --> 00:23:34,744
Time for Franky Radical Beam!

439
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:39,630
Move it, move it, move it!

440
00:23:43,341 --> 00:23:45,278
Gum-Gum...

441
00:23:45,686 --> 00:23:48,853
...Giant Pistol!

442
00:23:54,071 --> 00:23:54,941
That's it!

443
00:24:02,622 --> 00:24:04,769
A lotta strong pirates today!

444
00:24:04,837 --> 00:24:06,134
Well, keep it comin'!

445
00:24:10,947 --> 00:24:12,547
Shush, they'll notice us!

446
00:24:12,572 --> 00:24:15,715
Who needs a security gig if we can score some treasure?

447
00:24:15,765 --> 00:24:17,462
These guys are monsters!

448
00:24:17,487 --> 00:24:18,741
Suck on that!

449
00:24:32,325 --> 00:24:35,436
The secret base is right up ahead but be careful.

450
00:24:35,782 --> 00:24:38,469
That's where I got ambushed the last time I was here.

451
00:24:47,699 --> 00:24:48,377
Uhh...

452
00:24:51,746 --> 00:24:53,287
You couldn't hold it in a second?!

453
00:24:54,472 --> 00:24:55,536
I don't even have butt cheeks!

454
00:24:55,615 --> 00:24:56,895
Would you shut it?

455
00:24:57,331 --> 00:24:59,032
My apologies, Sanji.

456
00:24:59,405 --> 00:25:01,462
Let's stop and scope out the area.

457
00:25:01,822 --> 00:25:02,687
Ya got this?

458
00:25:02,712 --> 00:25:03,272
Of course.

459
00:25:03,296 --> 00:25:04,394
I can help, too.

460
00:25:09,749 --> 00:25:10,655
Don't worry,

461
00:25:10,774 --> 00:25:14,269
I wouldn't dream of causing trouble for my sponsors.

462
00:25:14,782 --> 00:25:16,638
Everything's going smoothly.

463
00:25:16,822 --> 00:25:19,308
All the pirates're lined up on the island.

464
00:25:20,122 --> 00:25:22,725
Just in time for the Buster Call.

465
00:25:26,154 --> 00:25:27,023
What's wrong?

466
00:25:28,657 --> 00:25:29,826
Well, spit it out!

467
00:25:30,525 --> 00:25:32,947
A Buster Call? That means...

468
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:36,978
Yeah, the Navy's gonna eliminate
everything and everyone on the island.

469
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:39,880
We'll be burnt to ash before we
even have a chance to fight back.

470
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,194
That's mass murder!

471
00:25:41,863 --> 00:25:43,571
They want us dead that bad?

472
00:25:43,623 --> 00:25:46,177
Hard to say, but we need to warn everyone.

473
00:25:49,785 --> 00:25:51,070
Straw Hats!

474
00:25:51,137 --> 00:25:53,358
How do you know about this place?!

475
00:25:54,891 --> 00:25:57,421
Let us answer before you attack, please.

476
00:25:57,446 --> 00:25:58,412
Careful, Brook.

477
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,660
His weapon's made of Sea Prism Stone.

478
00:26:01,065 --> 00:26:02,311
Can you blame me?

479
00:26:02,384 --> 00:26:05,577
Seems like half the pirates I
fight have Devil Fruit Powers.

480
00:26:05,613 --> 00:26:08,380
And since I can't throw all
of you into the sea, this'll do!

481
00:26:08,405 --> 00:26:10,018
I can handle this on my own.

482
00:26:10,071 --> 00:26:11,614
Find Luffy and tell him the news.

483
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:14,078
You're not going anywhere, ya punks!

484
00:26:19,363 --> 00:26:20,880
Take Robin with you and go!

485
00:26:20,905 --> 00:26:22,118
Just try it!

486
00:26:23,655 --> 00:26:25,257
Get away from her!

487
00:26:26,074 --> 00:26:27,115
Haki, huh?

488
00:26:30,238 --> 00:26:31,526
Out with it, already.

489
00:26:31,687 --> 00:26:32,854
What are you plotting?

490
00:26:32,905 --> 00:26:35,688
You got some nerve asking us that!

491
00:26:37,655 --> 00:26:40,004
Ooh! This is a close one!

492
00:26:40,052 --> 00:26:42,894
The pirates are dropping left and right in this bloodbath!

493
00:26:42,988 --> 00:26:46,215
But for those who refuse to submit, the fight rages on!

494
00:26:49,697 --> 00:26:50,797
Outta my way!

495
00:26:50,822 --> 00:26:52,619
I'll quit when you do!

496
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,367
Too late, losers!

497
00:26:57,071 --> 00:26:59,071
While you were busy punching each other,

498
00:26:59,154 --> 00:27:01,672
I got Gold Roger's treasure!

499
00:27:01,712 --> 00:27:03,838
Why'd it have to be that clown?

500
00:27:04,613 --> 00:27:05,752
Buggy!

501
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,716
If you want that treasure, then fight me!

502
00:27:08,822 --> 00:27:09,587
Ehh?

503
00:27:11,591 --> 00:27:13,267
Stupid, rubber bastard!

504
00:27:13,292 --> 00:27:15,043
Never mind, just run!

505
00:27:16,031 --> 00:27:17,156
Get back here!

506
00:27:17,238 --> 00:27:19,889
After that clown! He's got the treasure!

507
00:27:19,997 --> 00:27:20,826
Yes, sir!

508
00:27:21,164 --> 00:27:23,615
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

509
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:26,490
Don't be sore losers!

510
00:27:26,613 --> 00:27:28,802
Now, let's see what you left us, Roger.

511
00:27:28,863 --> 00:27:30,796
Knowing you, it's gotta be good!

512
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:31,732
What the...?

513
00:27:32,363 --> 00:27:34,863
Whoa, whoa, whoa, is this thing for real?

514
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:41,092
The treasure chest has been claimed by one of
the Seven Warlords, the Genius Jester, Buggy!

515
00:27:41,153 --> 00:27:42,743
But the other pirates are still...

516
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,703
What now?

517
00:27:54,405 --> 00:27:55,211
Uh-oh!

518
00:27:55,323 --> 00:27:56,433
The bubble popped!

519
00:28:00,116 --> 00:28:02,892
Someone help, please!

520
00:28:03,912 --> 00:28:06,856
Come back, you belong to me!

521
00:28:19,196 --> 00:28:20,594
That doesn't look good!

522
00:28:21,144 --> 00:28:23,711
This is not part of the program!

523
00:28:26,148 --> 00:28:28,412
Hang in there, Sunny!

524
00:28:33,156 --> 00:28:34,004
Luffy!

525
00:28:35,926 --> 00:28:38,749
I never asked for this!

526
00:28:40,446 --> 00:28:43,294
His Iron Arm is as powerful as ever.

527
00:28:43,363 --> 00:28:45,518
Twenty years in prison is a long time,

528
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:48,085
but I had faith it wouldn't slow him down much.

529
00:28:48,917 --> 00:28:51,564
Now make sure everything else is in place.

530
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,178
You all right, Kid?

531
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:03,291
C'mon, High Priest, you gotta get up!

532
00:29:03,322 --> 00:29:05,602
Well, this is a big mess!

533
00:29:06,029 --> 00:29:06,880
Captain!

534
00:29:06,969 --> 00:29:09,948
The Shadow of Death is not upon us yet.

535
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,927
What in the hell was that?

536
00:29:13,161 --> 00:29:14,111
Hang in there.

537
00:29:14,136 --> 00:29:16,082
I thought I had the treasure for sure.

538
00:29:16,107 --> 00:29:18,885
Captain Buggy!

539
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:24,576
Hooray, I'm not dead. And I got the treasure, too!

540
00:29:25,613 --> 00:29:26,562
No way.

541
00:29:27,446 --> 00:29:29,184
This actually exists?

542
00:29:31,697 --> 00:29:35,856
A galleon suddenly appeared, took
to the sky, and destroyed the island!

543
00:29:36,238 --> 00:29:37,301
Chaos!

544
00:29:37,326 --> 00:29:40,002
Where has the treasure gone in all of this wreckage?

545
00:29:40,933 --> 00:29:44,112
That sucked. Damnit! What the hell was that?

546
00:29:44,321 --> 00:29:44,838
Kid.

547
00:29:44,941 --> 00:29:45,776
Yeah?!

548
00:29:48,313 --> 00:29:49,760
This isn't funny.

549
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:51,403
It can't be.

550
00:30:09,672 --> 00:30:11,696
Usopp, no!

551
00:30:11,864 --> 00:30:15,463
This stained sea is a battlefield and a grave.

552
00:30:15,504 --> 00:30:17,735
Let him go, right now!

553
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,666
Luffy!

554
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:28,333
You bastard.

555
00:30:34,405 --> 00:30:36,342
You the jerk who beat up Traffy?

556
00:30:36,446 --> 00:30:38,008
I don't like you.

557
00:30:38,154 --> 00:30:40,513
Oh? You want more?

558
00:30:40,822 --> 00:30:43,237
I have a feeling this is about to get ugly.

559
00:30:43,262 --> 00:30:44,630
Should I know that man?

560
00:30:44,655 --> 00:30:47,046
Bah! I thought I was dead for sure!

561
00:30:47,071 --> 00:30:48,171
Oh, you're not?

562
00:30:48,196 --> 00:30:49,483
Do I look dead?

563
00:30:49,623 --> 00:30:52,254
Who did this? Did someone take my treasure?

564
00:30:52,302 --> 00:30:53,720
'Cause I will kill them!

565
00:30:53,829 --> 00:30:56,463
Huh? Gah! Why's he here?

566
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:57,864
Do you know him?

567
00:30:59,382 --> 00:31:01,654
Yeah. We used to be on the same crew.

568
00:31:01,847 --> 00:31:03,776
That is to say, Roger's crew.

569
00:31:04,174 --> 00:31:06,151
His name's Douglas Bullet.

570
00:31:06,379 --> 00:31:07,492
He's a beast.

571
00:31:07,738 --> 00:31:10,210
Used to be as strong as Rayleigh, even.

572
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,365
Rayleigh? The Pirate King's right-hand man?

573
00:31:16,098 --> 00:31:18,792
All right. Round two, then.

574
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:23,983
Whoa, what's that?

575
00:31:24,154 --> 00:31:24,639
Heh.

576
00:31:25,947 --> 00:31:28,524
No. No! Ah!

577
00:31:28,613 --> 00:31:31,312
This is bad!

578
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,528
They found us!

579
00:31:32,553 --> 00:31:35,278
I thought this party was kept secret from the Navy!

580
00:31:35,503 --> 00:31:36,976
What gives, Festa?!

581
00:31:37,071 --> 00:31:39,321
I thought you had this stuff under control!

582
00:31:39,405 --> 00:31:41,330
No way. The Navy?

583
00:31:41,697 --> 00:31:44,798
They brought a whole fleet! A big one!

584
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:51,430
Run away!

585
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,613
Wait for me!

586
00:31:52,697 --> 00:31:54,963
Which one of you snitched on us?

587
00:31:55,905 --> 00:31:58,113
The first fleet of battleships has arrived.

588
00:31:58,254 --> 00:31:59,713
They're right on time, sir.

589
00:31:59,754 --> 00:32:01,629
We just received a message from the Navy.

590
00:32:01,863 --> 00:32:03,505
"We appreciate your cooperation."

591
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,651
Ah. That must be Momonga.

592
00:32:06,738 --> 00:32:09,853
What now, pirates? It's up to you.

593
00:32:10,298 --> 00:32:13,937
So are you gonna fight? Or are you gonna run? Heh.

594
00:32:17,655 --> 00:32:20,229
Ugh! Festa sold us out, I bet!

595
00:32:20,321 --> 00:32:22,318
Sorry excuse for a pirate!

596
00:32:22,811 --> 00:32:23,477
Uh?

597
00:32:23,886 --> 00:32:25,574
Whoa, hey, wait for me!

598
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:30,630
No way out now.

599
00:32:30,718 --> 00:32:32,909
He got Roger's treasure. Isn't that enough?

600
00:32:34,978 --> 00:32:36,296
I don't care who you are.

601
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,207
Nobody messes with my crew.

602
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,638
I hope you're ready for a fight.

603
00:32:40,822 --> 00:32:42,205
Crew, you say?

604
00:32:43,118 --> 00:32:45,285
He couldn't even protect that treasure.

605
00:32:45,321 --> 00:32:47,115
You're better off without him.

606
00:32:47,863 --> 00:32:48,663
Heh.

607
00:32:49,154 --> 00:32:52,365
I heard you kids from the Worst Generation are strong.

608
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:55,345
You came to fight for Roger's treasure, didn't you?

609
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:57,155
Then come at me.

610
00:33:02,364 --> 00:33:04,101
He's got the Conqueror's Haki.

611
00:33:05,071 --> 00:33:06,547
Quite the demon, aren't you?

612
00:33:06,572 --> 00:33:08,029
I am not down with this.

613
00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:09,691
This is interesting.

614
00:33:30,613 --> 00:33:33,401
Something wrong? Too scared to move?

615
00:33:33,613 --> 00:33:35,499
Come at me... I'm right here.

616
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,412
Don't worry about the rest of them.

617
00:33:45,613 --> 00:33:46,867
Let's do this!

618
00:33:48,663 --> 00:33:49,378
Zoro!

619
00:33:50,188 --> 00:33:50,553
Hm?

620
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:55,567
As soon as we can get in touch with Sanji, we'll
meet up and plan an escape with the rest of the crew!

621
00:33:55,613 --> 00:33:59,507
It won't be easy getting past all those
battleships, so I'm open to suggestions!

622
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:02,670
I can protect Usopp. You watch the Sunny.

623
00:34:02,738 --> 00:34:03,655
Roger that!

624
00:34:03,796 --> 00:34:05,171
Mister Zoro!

625
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:08,494
If you need help, I'm here for ya! I'm always here for ya!

626
00:34:08,525 --> 00:34:09,725
Ugh! Your ship!

627
00:34:10,074 --> 00:34:11,496
Heh. Glad you're here!

628
00:34:11,618 --> 00:34:12,793
All right! Come with me!

629
00:34:12,832 --> 00:34:14,882
Zoro! Wrong way! Wrong way!

630
00:34:14,915 --> 00:34:16,023
No, stop!

631
00:34:16,048 --> 00:34:18,088
Mister Zoro, you're perfect just how you are!

632
00:34:18,113 --> 00:34:19,588
I've come to help as well!

633
00:34:19,613 --> 00:34:21,588
You'd better show some gratitude!

634
00:34:21,613 --> 00:34:23,653
Run before this gets ugly!

635
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:27,839
You break out of your cage and you think
you can pick a fight with us, old man?

636
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:29,451
We'll send you packing!

637
00:34:30,495 --> 00:34:31,644
Your choice.

638
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:35,157
One at a time, or all of you at once.

639
00:34:38,196 --> 00:34:40,163
The stage has been set.

640
00:34:40,655 --> 00:34:43,014
Ten minutes to have your fun out there.

641
00:34:43,197 --> 00:34:45,946
I know they don't call you the "Demon Heir" for nothing.

642
00:34:46,321 --> 00:34:47,590
Entertain me.

643
00:34:53,853 --> 00:34:55,546
Something bad must've happened.

644
00:34:55,571 --> 00:34:56,345
Usopp.

645
00:34:56,948 --> 00:34:58,782
What was that Vice Admiral doing?

646
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,327
It's like he was sneaking in.

647
00:35:05,952 --> 00:35:08,453
Just like old times.

648
00:35:09,279 --> 00:35:11,588
Hello there, Miss All Sunday.

649
00:35:11,613 --> 00:35:14,379
Crocodile. Why are you here?

650
00:35:14,413 --> 00:35:15,374
For the treasure?

651
00:35:15,604 --> 00:35:18,275
It must be something important
if it captured your attention.

652
00:35:19,469 --> 00:35:21,302
Something that could change the world,

653
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,477
if I had to guess.

654
00:35:22,905 --> 00:35:24,669
As perceptive as ever.

655
00:35:24,986 --> 00:35:28,640
I will say that Douglas Bullet is
involved, if that gives you a hint.

656
00:35:29,448 --> 00:35:31,174
From the Tragedy of Galzburg?

657
00:35:31,315 --> 00:35:34,109
The pirate who caused that massacre? Is he here?

658
00:35:34,227 --> 00:35:38,000
Yes, and as you know, his power is a bit of a nuisance.

659
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:39,882
What do you want from me?

660
00:35:40,188 --> 00:35:41,519
Nothing at all.

661
00:35:44,495 --> 00:35:46,970
You on the other hand, I need.

662
00:35:47,363 --> 00:35:48,619
I have a plan.

663
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:50,434
Now come along.

664
00:35:59,931 --> 00:36:01,971
Why're you snooping around here?

665
00:36:02,113 --> 00:36:03,384
What are you plotting?

666
00:36:04,907 --> 00:36:06,222
You're one to talk!

667
00:36:06,712 --> 00:36:08,383
You're making a Buster Call?!

668
00:36:08,613 --> 00:36:10,385
Huh? What're talking about?

669
00:36:12,113 --> 00:36:12,815
Cu-lick!

670
00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:14,619
Smoker, it's an emergency!

671
00:36:14,644 --> 00:36:17,044
Bullet showed up and the whole island's in chaos!

672
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,713
He took Roger's treasure.

673
00:36:18,738 --> 00:36:20,553
And now he's about to fight Straw Hat!

674
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:22,612
So that's how you want this?

675
00:36:23,068 --> 00:36:24,944
Captain Buggy! What's the plan?

676
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,588
Clearing out, of course!

677
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,317
You're clearin' out all those Navy battleships?

678
00:36:29,363 --> 00:36:30,713
I'm with you, Captain!

679
00:36:30,738 --> 00:36:31,772
Let's do it!

680
00:36:31,797 --> 00:36:34,227
You'd almost think I put wax in their ears.

681
00:36:34,321 --> 00:36:35,927
Never mind the Navy.

682
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:39,121
Bullet's worse than the whole fleet combined.

683
00:36:39,438 --> 00:36:41,567
The sooner we get outta here the better.

684
00:36:42,154 --> 00:36:44,356
Even if that treasure was One Piece itself,

685
00:36:44,655 --> 00:36:47,161
it wouldn't be worth facing that bastard.

686
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,363
You guys stay out of my way!

687
00:36:57,469 --> 00:37:00,296
Get in line, Straw Hat. I'm fighting him first!

688
00:37:00,321 --> 00:37:02,311
Gonna sit and chat all day?

689
00:37:18,644 --> 00:37:20,386
Demon Face!

690
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,519
Bam!

691
00:37:25,504 --> 00:37:26,487
Boom!

692
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:40,828
Huh?

693
00:37:45,694 --> 00:37:46,559
Get off!

694
00:37:47,074 --> 00:37:50,993
Let's see how tough you are once I turn you into a baby!

695
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:58,339
Gum-Gum...

696
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,175
...Elephant Gun!

697
00:38:05,738 --> 00:38:06,793
Hey, stupid!

698
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:08,505
Get outta my way!

699
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:10,530
Why don't the both of yous clear out?

700
00:38:11,505 --> 00:38:13,461
Here comes Big Father!

701
00:38:13,615 --> 00:38:15,381
Awesome!

702
00:38:27,241 --> 00:38:27,722
Hm?

703
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:35,523
Boom! Pow!

704
00:38:38,996 --> 00:38:39,487
Huh?

705
00:38:43,189 --> 00:38:44,874
Retribution!

706
00:38:50,238 --> 00:38:52,470
I'm gonna crush you!

707
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:55,385
Gum-Gum....

708
00:38:55,863 --> 00:38:58,950
...Red Hawk!

709
00:39:12,905 --> 00:39:15,279
I can beat him on my own! Y'see that?

710
00:39:15,304 --> 00:39:17,471
You got to him first. Big deal.

711
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:29,461
You brats are pretty good, but not good enough.

712
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:32,758
Training, strategy, determination.

713
00:39:32,822 --> 00:39:35,797
I find you lacking in so many areas.

714
00:39:35,822 --> 00:39:39,672
So let me to give you a demonstration
of what the real deal looks like.

715
00:39:39,713 --> 00:39:41,227
You won't forget.

716
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:49,675
Why're you here? What the hell do you want?

717
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:53,400
To be the strongest in the world.

718
00:39:54,045 --> 00:39:56,595
Glad you're taking this seriously now.

719
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,511
Don't die on me too quickly.

720
00:40:11,321 --> 00:40:13,213
I wanna clear out some of those Navy Ships.

721
00:40:13,238 --> 00:40:15,224
Make an escape path for Usopp and Luffy.

722
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:16,605
You look after the Sunny!

723
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:19,920
Mister Zoro trusts me!

724
00:40:20,363 --> 00:40:22,088
I'll protect the Sunny with my life!

725
00:40:22,145 --> 00:40:24,059
I promise, you can count on me!

726
00:40:24,681 --> 00:40:28,413
Let's see, which one of these ships do we cut down first?

727
00:40:31,448 --> 00:40:33,171
It's Fujitora!

728
00:40:33,196 --> 00:40:35,088
We got the boss already, huh?

729
00:40:35,113 --> 00:40:36,404
Make no mistake.

730
00:40:36,429 --> 00:40:38,860
The others may follow me if they so choose,

731
00:40:38,885 --> 00:40:41,537
but I've come to fight for my own sense of justice.

732
00:40:42,328 --> 00:40:44,697
Capture every pirate in sight!

733
00:40:44,722 --> 00:40:47,511
Admiral Fujitora will lead the way!

734
00:40:48,941 --> 00:40:51,963
Ugh! That's the last thing I need right now.

735
00:40:52,063 --> 00:40:55,648
Straw Hats! Heed my words!

736
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:57,616
Please save us!

737
00:40:57,641 --> 00:41:00,255
Save yourself! We've got enough problems!

738
00:41:03,238 --> 00:41:04,421
I caught Robin's scent!

739
00:41:04,446 --> 00:41:05,268
Robin!

740
00:41:05,371 --> 00:41:06,181
You made it!

741
00:41:06,206 --> 00:41:07,963
Robin!

742
00:41:07,988 --> 00:41:08,961
I was so worried!

743
00:41:08,986 --> 00:41:10,202
How sweet of you.

744
00:41:10,594 --> 00:41:11,553
Smoker's gone?

745
00:41:11,696 --> 00:41:13,077
Yeah. I guess.

746
00:41:13,405 --> 00:41:16,551
Something ended up spooking
him, then he took off in a flash.

747
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,610
Convenient, but it does trouble me.

748
00:41:18,846 --> 00:41:20,628
Wait, did you lose Law?

749
00:41:20,931 --> 00:41:22,717
It might take a moment to explain.

750
00:41:22,835 --> 00:41:23,266
Huh?

751
00:41:27,655 --> 00:41:30,417
All right, let's split into groups again.

752
00:41:30,796 --> 00:41:33,379
Chopper. Brook. You check up on Luffy.

753
00:41:33,446 --> 00:41:35,168
Let him know there's a Buster Call coming.

754
00:41:35,311 --> 00:41:35,859
Right.

755
00:41:36,065 --> 00:41:37,088
You're with me, Robin.

756
00:41:37,144 --> 00:41:37,787
All right.

757
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:41,380
Listen, everyone! Luffy's
gonna get that treasure for sure.

758
00:41:41,613 --> 00:41:44,137
So let's believe in him and form our plan around that.

759
00:41:44,162 --> 00:41:44,670
Right!

760
00:41:50,029 --> 00:41:52,520
We're... toys to him.

761
00:41:59,112 --> 00:42:00,064
You get it?

762
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:04,101
To become King of the Pirates,
you'll need to be as strong as me.

763
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:07,605
As strong as you?

764
00:42:07,697 --> 00:42:11,465
I'll be even stronger! I'll do whatever it takes to win!

765
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:13,621
Now, Fourth Gear!

766
00:42:13,905 --> 00:42:15,571
Form of Snake Man!

767
00:42:15,678 --> 00:42:19,365
Ha! You're using your Devil
Fruit Power with that much Haki?

768
00:42:19,476 --> 00:42:21,501
You're gonna burn out in no time at all.

769
00:42:21,525 --> 00:42:23,337
Then I guess I should hurry!

770
00:42:24,545 --> 00:42:25,021
Ha!

771
00:42:26,238 --> 00:42:27,850
Run! Python!

772
00:42:27,905 --> 00:42:29,772
Now, Gum-Gum...

773
00:42:29,954 --> 00:42:32,822
...Jet Culverin!

774
00:42:35,175 --> 00:42:37,279
Gum-Gum...

775
00:42:37,395 --> 00:42:40,624
...Black Mamba!

776
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,973
No wonder your bounty's so high. You got some spunk, kid.

777
00:43:00,697 --> 00:43:03,626
Come on, don't tell me it's over already!

778
00:43:05,029 --> 00:43:07,582
That's right! 'Cause I'm ending this!

779
00:43:08,113 --> 00:43:09,791
Gum-Gum...

780
00:43:10,363 --> 00:43:13,254
With talk like that, you better not let me down!

781
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:16,017
I want everything you've got and then some!

782
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:18,910
...King Cobra!

783
00:43:42,363 --> 00:43:45,043
"Former Crewmate of the Pirate King Defeated!"

784
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:48,063
"Straw Hat Luffy truly is the Fifth Emperor!"

785
00:43:48,188 --> 00:43:50,338
That would make one hell of a headline!

786
00:43:50,402 --> 00:43:51,652
Not a bad start.

787
00:43:51,692 --> 00:43:54,279
But this party's got plenty of twists and turns.

788
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:58,290
On Standby! Brachio Head! Change!

789
00:43:58,363 --> 00:44:01,241
Iron... Pirate!

790
00:44:02,117 --> 00:44:05,714
General Franky!

791
00:44:13,321 --> 00:44:14,741
Run away!

792
00:44:15,697 --> 00:44:17,793
Capture every last one!

793
00:44:21,741 --> 00:44:25,615
That pirate. What's the idea,
teamin' up with someone like him?

794
00:44:25,822 --> 00:44:28,905
They didn't volunteer that information, so I can't say.

795
00:44:28,988 --> 00:44:33,421
Perhaps we must carry it through before we
can decide if this war is worthwhile or not.

796
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,983
You're starting a war?

797
00:44:35,008 --> 00:44:36,310
Barrier Bulls!

798
00:44:37,254 --> 00:44:39,996
Blade of Beauty! Saint ExupÃ©ry!

799
00:44:41,689 --> 00:44:44,462
Y'think I'm scared of a bunch of chumps like you? Ha!

800
00:44:44,487 --> 00:44:46,122
Show 'em what's what, Boss!

801
00:44:46,147 --> 00:44:47,855
Now! Slow-Slow Bea...

802
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,296
That's enough of you!

803
00:44:49,321 --> 00:44:51,851
Stop the ship!

804
00:44:54,583 --> 00:44:56,044
You moron!

805
00:44:56,113 --> 00:44:58,857
Captain Buggy dove straight into the front lines!

806
00:44:59,081 --> 00:45:01,177
Is everyone in the entire crew stupid?

807
00:45:01,279 --> 00:45:02,575
Brace yourselves!

808
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,919
Zeus Breeze Tempo!

809
00:45:18,822 --> 00:45:21,626
You're pretty tough indeed, Straw Hat.

810
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:24,234
I like to see a strong pirate.

811
00:45:24,837 --> 00:45:27,188
But if I'm gonna be the strongest...

812
00:45:29,103 --> 00:45:31,343
...I have to kill all of you.

813
00:45:31,613 --> 00:45:34,491
The road to the top is paved in blood, after all.

814
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:36,802
Go be the strongest somewhere else.

815
00:45:36,988 --> 00:45:39,775
I won't let you lay another finger on my crew!

816
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,593
Nothing but drivel.

817
00:45:42,321 --> 00:45:44,271
The sea is a battlefield!

818
00:45:46,673 --> 00:45:49,786
Power's the only thing that matters in this world.

819
00:45:55,657 --> 00:45:56,767
What the hell?

820
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:04,131
This is my ship, the Catapult.

821
00:46:04,156 --> 00:46:07,493
Unlike any other. Constructed of solid iron.

822
00:46:07,549 --> 00:46:09,599
Filled to the brim with weapons.

823
00:46:10,744 --> 00:46:14,581
Union Armada! Engage!

824
00:46:20,273 --> 00:46:21,603
A Devil Fruit?

825
00:46:25,446 --> 00:46:28,780
I am a Combinable Human who ate the Clank Clank Fruit!

826
00:46:28,837 --> 00:46:33,276
I can combine all sorts of objects
and transform them into something deadly!

827
00:46:35,279 --> 00:46:39,806
My body has been honed to perfection,
but this power is even greater!

828
00:46:39,905 --> 00:46:42,729
You mean, all this time he was only toying with us?

829
00:46:42,813 --> 00:46:44,404
What's the plan now?

830
00:46:45,029 --> 00:46:48,213
The weak cannot survive in these turbulent seas.

831
00:46:48,269 --> 00:46:52,032
If they try, they end up like your "friend."

832
00:46:52,329 --> 00:46:56,121
You can only rely on yourself. Cut off anyone useless.

833
00:46:56,196 --> 00:46:57,928
You don't know anything.

834
00:46:58,446 --> 00:47:00,892
If you don't have friends, then what's the point anyway?

835
00:47:00,947 --> 00:47:02,138
Don't you get it?

836
00:47:02,281 --> 00:47:04,712
I see. Seems you're hopeless, after all.

837
00:47:05,347 --> 00:47:08,256
If old Whitebeard couldn't survive, then how can you?

838
00:47:08,738 --> 00:47:10,571
He saw his crew as a family,

839
00:47:10,655 --> 00:47:12,905
but all they really were was a weakness,

840
00:47:12,984 --> 00:47:14,833
just like your "friends."

841
00:47:15,113 --> 00:47:16,828
It was the same with Roger.

842
00:47:16,947 --> 00:47:19,593
If you're dead, then it's over... you've lost!

843
00:47:20,321 --> 00:47:24,511
Your friends are a chain around your
neck... one that hangs you in the end.

844
00:47:24,613 --> 00:47:26,665
My strength is mine alone.

845
00:47:27,029 --> 00:47:29,532
Because there's only room for one at the top!

846
00:47:30,002 --> 00:47:33,002
I'm about to show you how wrong you are!

847
00:47:33,133 --> 00:47:33,703
Ha!

848
00:47:34,076 --> 00:47:37,532
If you wanna talk big, then let's
see if you can take this treasure back!

849
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:40,168
And let me tell you before you die,

850
00:47:40,193 --> 00:47:41,546
this isn't a fake.

851
00:47:41,571 --> 00:47:43,794
It really is Roger's treasure.

852
00:47:44,395 --> 00:47:46,351
Having what's in this box

853
00:47:47,113 --> 00:47:50,062
is the same as having One Piece itself.

854
00:47:53,488 --> 00:47:56,092
One Piece. No way.

855
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:04,191
Here lies your grave.

856
00:48:04,402 --> 00:48:07,074
Now struggle to the bitter end!

857
00:48:08,625 --> 00:48:12,096
Gravity Blade! Raging Tiger!

858
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,910
One Thousand Eighty Caliber Phoenix!

859
00:48:20,537 --> 00:48:22,884
Ultra Tiger Hunt!

860
00:48:31,405 --> 00:48:34,309
By the time those jerks get backup, we'll be home free!

861
00:48:37,287 --> 00:48:38,589
Not him, too!

862
00:48:42,196 --> 00:48:44,080
They sent the Warlords to help us?

863
00:48:44,231 --> 00:48:47,505
Fine, then. Commence attack! Pacifistas!

864
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:49,984
Negative Hollow!

865
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:54,497
I'm nothing but a lowly slug.

866
00:48:56,102 --> 00:48:58,183
Not very cute are you? Pity.

867
00:48:58,658 --> 00:49:00,350
Uh? What was that?

868
00:49:00,553 --> 00:49:02,511
How unsightly!

869
00:49:02,571 --> 00:49:06,296
Who put this thing in my path?
I'll just have to remove it.

870
00:49:06,352 --> 00:49:08,129
It's really her! Oh, boy!

871
00:49:08,201 --> 00:49:13,334
Empress and Warlord of the Sea! Boa Hancock, in the flesh!

872
00:49:13,613 --> 00:49:15,635
I shall do whatever I so please,

873
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:18,259
and you shall allow it all, without objection.

874
00:49:18,571 --> 00:49:22,447
Why you ask? Because I am beautiful. Any questions?

875
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:25,588
This should be easy with your help!

876
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:26,785
Now go give 'em hell!

877
00:49:26,896 --> 00:49:29,047
Silence! Lead me to Luffy!

878
00:49:29,072 --> 00:49:30,403
The Warlords are so cool!

879
00:49:30,428 --> 00:49:32,689
And we've got three of 'em here. I can't believe it!

880
00:49:32,822 --> 00:49:33,947
Are you kidding me?

881
00:49:34,063 --> 00:49:35,856
Y'think I'd stick around for this?

882
00:49:35,905 --> 00:49:38,661
Not even if I had nine lives! Later!

883
00:49:40,905 --> 00:49:42,738
Admirals and Warlords?

884
00:49:42,822 --> 00:49:45,288
Are you trying to start a war over there, Festa?

885
00:49:45,405 --> 00:49:47,417
You're close, but not quite.

886
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:48,879
That's the Navy for ya.

887
00:49:48,983 --> 00:49:50,540
Had a feeling they'd go all out.

888
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,662
They sure want that treasure, don't they?

889
00:49:53,587 --> 00:49:56,760
Sorry, brats. It's over!

890
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:07,582
Look out!

891
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:11,666
I'll grind this lesson into your bones!

892
00:50:12,047 --> 00:50:13,172
You okay?

893
00:50:13,356 --> 00:50:14,154
Killer!

894
00:50:14,238 --> 00:50:15,604
You'll pay!

895
00:50:15,788 --> 00:50:19,991
This strength cannot be reached
when you're shackled by dependence!

896
00:50:21,321 --> 00:50:24,750
And those who lack it will surely lose everything.

897
00:50:51,863 --> 00:50:53,145
Do you see now?

898
00:50:53,256 --> 00:50:55,838
Many will lose before the battle is done,

899
00:50:56,277 --> 00:50:58,610
but only one can win in the end.

900
00:50:58,739 --> 00:51:01,082
Only one can be King!

901
00:51:12,321 --> 00:51:13,825
An Eternal Pose?

902
00:51:13,947 --> 00:51:15,589
That leads to Laugh Tale?

903
00:51:15,738 --> 00:51:17,384
And this is no hoax?

904
00:51:17,464 --> 00:51:20,706
A scoop like this could flip
the world upside down, you know!

905
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,216
It's true.

906
00:51:23,462 --> 00:51:26,204
The treasure is a guide that leads straight to Laugh Tale.

907
00:51:26,405 --> 00:51:28,634
The island where One Piece rests.

908
00:51:29,394 --> 00:51:31,359
There was a shortcut all along,

909
00:51:31,446 --> 00:51:34,522
but that idiot Roger buried it in the darkness.

910
00:51:35,321 --> 00:51:38,774
It's the spark that will light the way to a brand-new era.

911
00:51:39,238 --> 00:51:41,824
A festival of madness, burning bright!

912
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:44,825
Now die.

913
00:51:46,363 --> 00:51:47,026
Hm?

914
00:51:53,827 --> 00:51:56,871
This fight's not over yet. Not while I'm here!

915
00:51:59,422 --> 00:52:01,152
What's this nonsense?

916
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:05,768
Not only are you weak, but stupid as well.

917
00:52:10,774 --> 00:52:11,331
Huh?

918
00:52:13,905 --> 00:52:15,713
My captain is risking his life.

919
00:52:15,758 --> 00:52:17,950
I have to return the favor, don't I?

920
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:20,706
This is no time to be a coward!

921
00:52:22,089 --> 00:52:24,106
All bark and no bite.

922
00:52:24,154 --> 00:52:25,989
A yapping dog.

923
00:52:26,071 --> 00:52:28,038
With a foolish master.

924
00:52:33,262 --> 00:52:36,422
A festival invites one to abandon restraint.

925
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:38,074
And my festival

926
00:52:38,891 --> 00:52:41,992
will plunge the world into a state of madness!

927
00:52:43,506 --> 00:52:45,567
We'll call it a stampede!

928
00:52:47,368 --> 00:52:49,651
You won't wanna miss it.

929
00:52:50,822 --> 00:52:52,143
Hmm...

930
00:52:52,405 --> 00:52:55,100
Turning into a real mess, I must say.

931
00:52:55,129 --> 00:52:56,814
Admiral! I have a report!

932
00:52:59,063 --> 00:53:01,071
Huh. So the treasure was real.

933
00:53:01,193 --> 00:53:03,337
Can't ignore that, can we?

934
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:06,190
Let's show 'em what we're made of!

935
00:53:06,697 --> 00:53:08,749
There's lots of us. We got this!

936
00:53:08,863 --> 00:53:09,963
Go!

937
00:53:19,049 --> 00:53:20,580
One! Two!

938
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,326
Django!

939
00:53:24,782 --> 00:53:26,688
Kimono Sleeve Cage!

940
00:53:28,029 --> 00:53:28,817
Lock!

941
00:53:35,029 --> 00:53:37,042
Forget these guys. Go for Bullet.

942
00:53:37,071 --> 00:53:38,066
Help me, Hina.

943
00:53:38,129 --> 00:53:41,213
Whoa, what's that outfit? Is there something I don't know?

944
00:53:41,629 --> 00:53:43,690
Smoker! There you are!

945
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:45,588
I need some answers before we go.

946
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:48,410
Well, for starters, HQ is hiding the truth from us.

947
00:53:48,446 --> 00:53:48,903
Huh?

948
00:53:49,263 --> 00:53:51,546
It has to do with Roger's lost treasure.

949
00:53:51,571 --> 00:53:55,672
From what I've seen, depending on
what it is, they may do something crazy.

950
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:57,755
I see. You're acting on your own.

951
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:00,049
Suck it, Marine! Ah!

952
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:02,238
Can you just do your mission, please?

953
00:54:02,321 --> 00:54:03,489
I can do both.

954
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:06,533
Outta the way!

955
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,789
What is this stuff?

956
00:54:10,029 --> 00:54:11,680
You're all under arrest!

957
00:54:11,988 --> 00:54:14,321
Let's make this quick!

958
00:54:14,346 --> 00:54:15,223
Buggy.

959
00:54:16,071 --> 00:54:17,238
Why're you here?

960
00:54:17,281 --> 00:54:19,475
Watch where you're aiming that, ya big dope!

961
00:54:20,376 --> 00:54:21,793
Not you guys!

962
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,296
Uh. I mean, I'm a Warlord, you can't treat me like this!

963
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:25,755
We're on the same side!

964
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:28,722
Wait a sec. You saw what was inside that chest, right?

965
00:54:28,747 --> 00:54:29,231
He did?

966
00:54:29,256 --> 00:54:31,614
You have to tell us what it was! This could be bad!

967
00:54:31,758 --> 00:54:34,630
What?! Isn't it bad enough already?!

968
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:37,494
Just save yourself and get the hell out of here!

969
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:39,846
Stop squirming and spit it out!

970
00:54:39,915 --> 00:54:41,129
I can't breathe!

971
00:54:41,213 --> 00:54:42,163
Smoker!

972
00:54:42,227 --> 00:54:44,476
All right, all right, fine, I'll tell you!

973
00:54:44,571 --> 00:54:48,113
It's an Eternal Pose! An Eternal Pose to Laugh Tale!

974
00:54:49,292 --> 00:54:50,256
It can't be.

975
00:54:50,363 --> 00:54:51,154
Charge!

976
00:54:51,238 --> 00:54:52,732
Capture the pirates!

977
00:55:00,614 --> 00:55:02,466
The course of this battle is changing.

978
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:04,737
Let us postpone our duel for now.

979
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:05,245
Huh?

980
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:12,154
Farewell, then. You may consider this a parting gift.

981
00:55:12,238 --> 00:55:13,390
Get back here!

982
00:55:19,488 --> 00:55:21,033
That doesn't look good.

983
00:55:22,863 --> 00:55:24,083
A meteor?

984
00:55:24,172 --> 00:55:25,950
Retreat! Retreat!

985
00:55:27,196 --> 00:55:29,121
Mister Zoro, help!

986
00:55:29,446 --> 00:55:32,529
Nine mountains and eight seas make one world!

987
00:55:32,554 --> 00:55:33,205
Huh?

988
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:35,838
One thousand worlds make one chiliocosm!

989
00:55:35,863 --> 00:55:38,129
One chiliocosm to the power of three,

990
00:55:38,154 --> 00:55:39,989
and there's nothing I can't cut!

991
00:55:40,029 --> 00:55:42,619
Three-Sword Style Secret Technique!

992
00:55:43,235 --> 00:55:45,703
The Billion-fold World.

993
00:55:48,029 --> 00:55:50,644
Trichiliocosm!

994
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,767
We're okay!

995
00:55:58,571 --> 00:56:00,988
Not okay!

996
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:02,752
There's no time.

997
00:56:10,769 --> 00:56:11,833
What?

998
00:56:19,238 --> 00:56:22,249
Anything beyond this is outside of my contract.

999
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,987
Let's go, Ghost Girl.

1000
00:56:24,012 --> 00:56:26,243
Uh! Since when do I answer to you?

1001
00:56:26,279 --> 00:56:29,065
And next time you slice up a meteor, warn me first!

1002
00:56:29,153 --> 00:56:30,495
That startled me!

1003
00:56:30,863 --> 00:56:32,108
We'd better hurry!

1004
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:35,446
Luffy! Where are you?

1005
00:56:35,822 --> 00:56:39,425
Usopp! Are you here?

1006
00:56:49,947 --> 00:56:52,120
Ready! Fire!

1007
00:56:53,732 --> 00:56:56,314
You wanna fight me? Are you sure?

1008
00:57:00,499 --> 00:57:01,428
Fine.

1009
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:03,496
Don't say I didn't warn you!

1010
00:57:14,947 --> 00:57:16,686
Pull out your soldiers and your ships!

1011
00:57:16,777 --> 00:57:18,918
He's trying to gather us all in one spot!

1012
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:20,188
Too late now!

1013
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:23,119
Have a taste of my awakened power!

1014
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:25,641
I've been waiting for this!

1015
00:57:34,023 --> 00:57:34,983
What's that?

1016
00:57:37,029 --> 00:57:40,680
The awakened power of my Devil
Fruit extends to the world itself!

1017
00:57:40,989 --> 00:57:44,899
There's nothing I can't absorb.
Nothing I can't reassemble!

1018
00:57:51,279 --> 00:57:52,321
What's happening?

1019
00:57:52,346 --> 00:57:53,955
It's a bunch of purple stuff!

1020
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:11,765
He's absorbing our ships!

1021
00:58:40,835 --> 00:58:42,808
How are you supposed to fight that thing?

1022
00:58:43,481 --> 00:58:45,133
This keeps getting worse!

1023
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:54,922
No! It can't be!

1024
00:58:56,905 --> 00:58:59,142
He's trying to trap us here on the island!

1025
00:59:01,116 --> 00:59:02,073
Luffy.

1026
00:59:04,354 --> 00:59:06,944
So what'cha gonna do now, Navy?

1027
00:59:07,156 --> 00:59:09,528
Only got one choice, I'd say!

1028
00:59:11,299 --> 00:59:12,715
I'll crush you.

1029
00:59:25,382 --> 00:59:27,650
The vice admirals are down in one shot!

1030
00:59:32,279 --> 00:59:33,505
Run away!

1031
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:35,086
It's gonna drop on us!

1032
00:59:35,231 --> 00:59:39,805
Ultimate Faust!

1033
00:59:49,033 --> 00:59:51,237
He's splitting the island in two!

1034
00:59:53,446 --> 00:59:58,634
Twenty-four years ago, I lost to the
Navy and was imprisoned in Impel Down.

1035
00:59:58,922 --> 01:00:00,977
I asked myself then:

1036
01:00:01,421 --> 01:00:06,380
"How can I obtain power so overwhelming
that I'll never lose to anyone ever again?

1037
01:00:06,589 --> 01:00:08,771
How can I surpass Gold Roger?

1038
01:00:08,873 --> 01:00:11,591
How can I become the strongest in the world?"

1039
01:00:11,943 --> 01:00:12,411
Heh.

1040
01:00:12,743 --> 01:00:14,556
Are you here, Fleet Admiral?

1041
01:00:15,196 --> 01:00:18,473
I've got the Eternal Pose that'll
lead you straight to One Piece.

1042
01:00:18,819 --> 01:00:22,461
Come and fight me, just like
you did before! See if you can win!

1043
01:00:30,823 --> 01:00:32,757
At least the treasure is close.

1044
01:00:33,652 --> 01:00:35,928
I have no idea what's going on.

1045
01:00:36,422 --> 01:00:38,447
There must have been hundreds of ships out there.

1046
01:00:38,472 --> 01:00:41,910
I can't believe he swallowed nearly all
of them with that awakened power of his.

1047
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:44,762
That power's a nuisance, but his Haki is worse.

1048
01:00:44,905 --> 01:00:48,974
Every inch of that giant body of his
seems to be coated in Armament Haki.

1049
01:00:49,463 --> 01:00:52,088
Without a good plan, we're finished.

1050
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:56,267
There has to be something.

1051
01:00:57,581 --> 01:01:00,161
He made all that with his Devil Fruit power, right?

1052
01:01:00,279 --> 01:01:03,441
So if Luffy takes him out,
it'll disappear and we can bail.

1053
01:01:04,129 --> 01:01:06,310
Then we'll just have to put our faith in him.

1054
01:01:07,405 --> 01:01:09,922
What now? We're trapped down here!

1055
01:01:10,002 --> 01:01:13,992
Bullet still has the Pirate King's treasure,
but we can't stop him 'cause he swallowed our ships

1056
01:01:14,084 --> 01:01:16,338
and got all big and now we don't know what to do!

1057
01:01:16,421 --> 01:01:17,463
Ahh!

1058
01:01:17,488 --> 01:01:18,209
Cu-lick.

1059
01:01:19,238 --> 01:01:20,780
I can see that for myself.

1060
01:01:20,863 --> 01:01:23,041
It's pretty hard to miss.

1061
01:01:23,113 --> 01:01:24,358
It's the Fleet Admiral!

1062
01:01:25,545 --> 01:01:28,336
I see. An awakened power.

1063
01:01:28,458 --> 01:01:31,057
I didn't think he'd grown quite so strong.

1064
01:01:32,506 --> 01:01:33,972
Listen, Borsalino.

1065
01:01:35,466 --> 01:01:38,811
There are some troublemakers
looking to complicate this matter,

1066
01:01:38,863 --> 01:01:41,140
but evil must be eliminated thoroughly,

1067
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:43,761
till nothing but ash remains.

1068
01:01:43,916 --> 01:01:48,178
If they want it so bad, give 'em a Buster Call.

1069
01:01:51,627 --> 01:01:52,889
Marvelous!

1070
01:01:53,069 --> 01:01:55,129
You really are somethin', Bullet!

1071
01:01:55,363 --> 01:01:59,126
I bet the rest of my life on
you and it was the right choice!

1072
01:01:59,363 --> 01:02:02,822
That bastard Roger launched
the Dawn of the Great Pirate Era.

1073
01:02:02,937 --> 01:02:05,975
It was the biggest festival the world's ever seen.

1074
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:07,922
It's not fair.

1075
01:02:07,999 --> 01:02:11,353
Even Buena Festa had no way to top that.

1076
01:02:12,279 --> 01:02:13,571
It took time.

1077
01:02:13,655 --> 01:02:15,524
But now I have a weapon.

1078
01:02:15,822 --> 01:02:17,697
I can make a whole new era.

1079
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:18,804
A better one.

1080
01:02:19,862 --> 01:02:21,695
I'll bury Roger's legacy!

1081
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:24,804
This world's future belongs to me!

1082
01:02:30,738 --> 01:02:33,774
Is that really the best you can do?

1083
01:02:33,963 --> 01:02:38,376
Come on, Fleet Admiral! I know you're tougher than this!

1084
01:02:38,519 --> 01:02:40,661
Give me all you've got!

1085
01:02:40,738 --> 01:02:42,545
There's no turning back now!

1086
01:02:42,616 --> 01:02:46,105
A Buster Call is the symbol of the
World Government's absolute power.

1087
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:48,997
If Bullet challenges that power and overcomes it,

1088
01:02:49,022 --> 01:02:51,412
he'll prove he's the strongest, without a doubt!

1089
01:02:51,492 --> 01:02:53,672
The whole world will get turned upside down!

1090
01:02:53,697 --> 01:02:54,946
Now that's a scoop!

1091
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:56,798
All right.

1092
01:02:57,154 --> 01:02:59,784
You buncha underworld scumbags.

1093
01:03:00,756 --> 01:03:02,755
We possess the key to One Piece.

1094
01:03:02,811 --> 01:03:05,352
An Eternal Pose to lead us to Laugh Tale.

1095
01:03:05,473 --> 01:03:06,967
So in other words...

1096
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:11,599
It's time for the pirates to die and you along with them!

1097
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:13,712
Absurd!

1098
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:18,823
Roger is dead, and his era, too.

1099
01:03:20,082 --> 01:03:23,058
The tides that swept across the world grow still.

1100
01:03:23,113 --> 01:03:26,623
The pirates who command these seas will be buried!

1101
01:03:26,931 --> 01:03:30,088
The new era, forged in the fires of war,

1102
01:03:30,279 --> 01:03:32,113
will be my masterpiece!

1103
01:03:32,196 --> 01:03:33,571
An endless festival!

1104
01:03:33,655 --> 01:03:36,420
A world-wide stampede of hysteria!

1105
01:03:36,655 --> 01:03:38,708
You want my treasure? Come and get it!

1106
01:03:38,774 --> 01:03:40,339
Steal it if you can!

1107
01:03:41,446 --> 01:03:42,738
Wealth, fame, power.

1108
01:03:42,822 --> 01:03:45,452
All the world has to offer is right here!

1109
01:03:51,531 --> 01:03:54,033
I promised hysteria, didn't I?

1110
01:03:54,184 --> 01:03:55,964
And there you have it.

1111
01:03:57,073 --> 01:03:58,540
D'you see this, Roger?

1112
01:03:58,655 --> 01:04:01,485
It's the end of your dull little era of treasure hunting.

1113
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:02,380
I killed it.

1114
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:04,005
I surpassed you!

1115
01:04:04,113 --> 01:04:06,084
The treasure's in plain sight!

1116
01:04:06,563 --> 01:04:08,468
They'll fight, and they'll bleed, in a festival

1117
01:04:08,738 --> 01:04:11,264
where only the strong survive!

1118
01:04:11,351 --> 01:04:12,972
That's my masterpiece!

1119
01:04:13,406 --> 01:04:15,826
This is my era!

1120
01:04:17,172 --> 01:04:20,291
Not only has he invited a full-scale battle with the Navy,

1121
01:04:20,317 --> 01:04:23,428
he's made a declaration of war on all the world's pirates.

1122
01:04:23,539 --> 01:04:27,988
That may sound like suicide, but it seems their
only purpose is to destroy the current world order

1123
01:04:28,013 --> 01:04:29,998
and plunge everything into chaos.

1124
01:04:30,947 --> 01:04:33,047
Douglas Bullet is our main target.

1125
01:04:33,504 --> 01:04:37,696
He was a war orphan born in the
Grand Line's militarist nation Galzburg.

1126
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:41,644
He served as a child soldier and
quickly became recognized as a hero.

1127
01:04:41,863 --> 01:04:45,592
However, his superiors grew fearful of
his strength and tried to have him killed.

1128
01:04:45,863 --> 01:04:48,650
Bullet, enraged by this, retaliated so fiercely

1129
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:50,628
that the entire nation was destroyed.

1130
01:04:50,956 --> 01:04:56,039
After that, he took to the sea and challenged
Gold Roger, apparently as a means of testing himself.

1131
01:04:56,154 --> 01:05:00,607
Roger was victorious, and eventually,
Bullet joined his crew, at least for a time.

1132
01:05:00,989 --> 01:05:02,895
Eventually, the Navy caught up to him,

1133
01:05:03,005 --> 01:05:05,264
and the then-Admiral Sengoku, along with...

1134
01:05:07,867 --> 01:05:09,784
Betrayed by his superiors,

1135
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,071
then betrayed by his friends, as well.

1136
01:05:12,323 --> 01:05:13,930
How could he trust anyone?

1137
01:05:14,015 --> 01:05:18,300
How could he do anything except fight in
order to protect his place in the world?

1138
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,997
But Roger taught him defeat was not the end.

1139
01:05:21,096 --> 01:05:22,971
That there were other people in this world

1140
01:05:23,071 --> 01:05:24,926
Bullet could still put his faith in.

1141
01:05:25,156 --> 01:05:27,255
And so he became the "Demon Heir,"

1142
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:29,630
supporting the very man that had bested him.

1143
01:05:29,749 --> 01:05:32,323
Though he never gave up on challenging Roger.

1144
01:05:32,949 --> 01:05:34,659
But then Roger died,

1145
01:05:35,446 --> 01:05:37,425
and Bullet didn't know what to do.

1146
01:05:37,457 --> 01:05:40,093
He returned to a life of violence and death.

1147
01:05:41,014 --> 01:05:46,108
Losing his rival and dream in one fell
swoop, he became a monster without purpose.

1148
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:48,856
Of course, we couldn't let him run wild.

1149
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:52,066
But the only way to stop him, unfortunately,

1150
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:54,029
was a Buster Call.

1151
01:06:01,682 --> 01:06:03,491
We can't sympathize with him.

1152
01:06:03,697 --> 01:06:05,947
He's trying to drag the world into a war.

1153
01:06:06,012 --> 01:06:08,114
It's our job to stop that from happening.

1154
01:06:08,285 --> 01:06:09,440
No, you're right.

1155
01:06:09,594 --> 01:06:12,389
But the thought of spilling so much blood a second time.

1156
01:06:12,446 --> 01:06:14,893
Well, it doesn't put a smile on my face.

1157
01:06:15,879 --> 01:06:17,650
I can't help but wonder.

1158
01:06:18,363 --> 01:06:20,296
If Roger could stop him before,

1159
01:06:20,336 --> 01:06:23,276
could another pirate like him come along and do the same?

1160
01:06:34,413 --> 01:06:38,014
Did ya see that, Luffy? He ran away.

1161
01:06:39,251 --> 01:06:43,536
The bastard got one good look at me and fled in terror.

1162
01:06:46,332 --> 01:06:51,521
I say he's not worth it. Let him go for today.

1163
01:07:02,044 --> 01:07:04,470
Please, Luffy. Don't die.

1164
01:07:05,201 --> 01:07:07,243
You gotta stand up again.

1165
01:07:07,445 --> 01:07:09,402
It can't end here.

1166
01:07:13,235 --> 01:07:14,949
Our journey isn't over.

1167
01:07:20,587 --> 01:07:22,076
You think I'm giving up?!

1168
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,541
Not a chance!

1169
01:07:26,113 --> 01:07:27,361
I won't rest

1170
01:07:28,076 --> 01:07:31,547
until the day that Luffy becomes the King of the Pirates!

1171
01:07:38,357 --> 01:07:41,551
The Chill of the Underworld: Soul Solid!

1172
01:07:41,988 --> 01:07:42,932
Usopp!

1173
01:07:45,128 --> 01:07:46,182
Are you okay?

1174
01:07:46,497 --> 01:07:49,170
That looks bad. I'll fix you right up!

1175
01:07:50,591 --> 01:07:53,252
Forget about me. Treat Luffy.

1176
01:07:53,644 --> 01:07:56,811
He lost a lotta blood back there.

1177
01:07:56,836 --> 01:07:58,940
But if I leave you, then I...

1178
01:08:00,015 --> 01:08:03,120
Chopper, please.

1179
01:08:05,178 --> 01:08:06,011
All right, then.

1180
01:08:08,237 --> 01:08:10,976
We gotta move, Robin. This place isn't gonna hold.

1181
01:08:11,099 --> 01:08:13,374
Here we go! This is all we need!

1182
01:08:21,154 --> 01:08:25,026
Retreat! Everybody, pull out, right now!

1183
01:08:25,394 --> 01:08:27,393
Disengage and go!

1184
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:30,015
Admiral Kizaru says you have five minutes!

1185
01:08:30,113 --> 01:08:32,660
Get to the remaining ships, immediately!

1186
01:08:32,697 --> 01:08:34,046
Pull out!

1187
01:08:34,071 --> 01:08:36,697
I need more details. That doesn't make any sense!

1188
01:08:36,803 --> 01:08:39,801
I'm sorry, ma'am, but we don't have
time to stand here and discuss this!

1189
01:08:39,947 --> 01:08:42,295
The Admiral ordered a Buster Call!

1190
01:08:42,766 --> 01:08:43,893
Are you kidding me?

1191
01:08:43,949 --> 01:08:49,363
Admiral Kizaru's second fleet is on standby at sea
and will begin a barrage of cannon fire in five minutes!

1192
01:08:49,414 --> 01:08:50,605
That's so soon!

1193
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:53,093
Anyone who stays behind is as good as dead!

1194
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:55,976
We still have enough ships to retreat on if we hurry!

1195
01:08:56,081 --> 01:08:57,630
He's lost his mind.

1196
01:08:57,655 --> 01:08:58,843
Attention!

1197
01:08:58,910 --> 01:09:01,180
Everyone retreat immediately!

1198
01:09:04,899 --> 01:09:07,034
Retreat! Back to the ships, now!

1199
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:08,744
Five minutes isn't nearly enough time!

1200
01:09:08,863 --> 01:09:10,945
What's going on? This is nuts!

1201
01:09:11,029 --> 01:09:11,945
Don't push!

1202
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:15,189
Finally.

1203
01:09:15,243 --> 01:09:17,857
You decided I'm worthy of your Buster Call.

1204
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:19,655
But I won't lose again!

1205
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:23,220
I'll prove that I am the only
absolute power in this world!

1206
01:09:23,763 --> 01:09:26,891
And when I'm done, the Four Emperors will die next.

1207
01:09:27,238 --> 01:09:29,139
Then I'll be King!

1208
01:09:30,863 --> 01:09:33,406
I'm not happy either, but we have to go!

1209
01:09:34,338 --> 01:09:35,938
Go on without me.

1210
01:09:36,363 --> 01:09:38,381
No way! If you're staying, then I am!

1211
01:09:38,406 --> 01:09:40,182
I'll stay, too... I can still fight!

1212
01:09:40,207 --> 01:09:42,304
Uh. Me, too, I guess.

1213
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:48,858
You're a lost cause.

1214
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:52,922
Hina! Let me go!

1215
01:09:52,947 --> 01:09:54,578
We can't just leave him here!

1216
01:09:55,196 --> 01:09:56,906
Smoker! Help!

1217
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,571
All I gotta do is steal Roger's treasure from Bullet.

1218
01:10:04,687 --> 01:10:07,395
I'm not gonna let our own men get caught in the crossfire.

1219
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:10,605
I'll put an end to this stupid operation before that.

1220
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:13,577
All right, you filthy pirates.

1221
01:10:14,182 --> 01:10:16,729
It's time to put an end to your party!

1222
01:10:16,806 --> 01:10:18,007
Heat Haze!

1223
01:10:23,422 --> 01:10:27,589
I agree that Bullet needs to be taken care of, Marine.

1224
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:30,385
But there's no way you can pull that off on your own.

1225
01:10:30,732 --> 01:10:32,689
Revolutionaries are here, too?

1226
01:10:32,807 --> 01:10:35,454
If I recall, you're Straw Hat's friend.

1227
01:10:35,766 --> 01:10:37,456
Older brother, actually.

1228
01:10:37,849 --> 01:10:39,919
I know he can be quite a handful,

1229
01:10:40,174 --> 01:10:41,834
but take it easy on the kid.

1230
01:10:42,341 --> 01:10:44,559
First, you get outta my way!

1231
01:10:48,031 --> 01:10:49,566
Let's hurry!

1232
01:10:49,614 --> 01:10:51,814
Pull out! To the shore!

1233
01:10:52,412 --> 01:10:53,370
Look at that!

1234
01:10:53,398 --> 01:10:55,301
The Navy's freakin' out down there!

1235
01:10:55,453 --> 01:10:57,065
Miss Nami!

1236
01:10:57,154 --> 01:10:58,963
Let us help! What's next?

1237
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:01,364
We can't make our move until Luffy gets back here.

1238
01:11:01,549 --> 01:11:04,725
For now, just keep the faith
and see if anyone else needs you!

1239
01:11:04,782 --> 01:11:07,139
You are such a boss, Miss Nami!

1240
01:11:07,227 --> 01:11:08,936
Praise me later, just go!

1241
01:11:08,988 --> 01:11:10,134
Yes, ma'am!

1242
01:11:13,947 --> 01:11:15,171
Where are you, Luffy?

1243
01:11:15,227 --> 01:11:16,873
There has to be some sort of clue.

1244
01:11:20,051 --> 01:11:21,242
It's his red shirt!

1245
01:11:22,047 --> 01:11:23,338
Luffy, are you in there?

1246
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:26,128
I'll rescue you! Be brave!

1247
01:11:26,530 --> 01:11:27,064
Huh?

1248
01:11:27,363 --> 01:11:27,913
Huh?

1249
01:11:29,071 --> 01:11:31,075
Don't touch me, you cur!

1250
01:11:39,279 --> 01:11:41,658
Hey, Chopper. That you?

1251
01:11:41,863 --> 01:11:43,612
Yeah, I gotcha, don't worry.

1252
01:11:43,738 --> 01:11:45,463
We're lucky we found you when we did!

1253
01:11:45,546 --> 01:11:47,588
You and Usopp were in terrible shape!

1254
01:11:47,613 --> 01:11:49,588
This has turned into a real mess.

1255
01:11:49,692 --> 01:11:51,455
And we've got bad news.

1256
01:11:52,019 --> 01:11:55,341
The Navy's about to do a Buster
Call and blow up the whole island.

1257
01:11:56,065 --> 01:11:59,487
That guy ate a bunch of ships
and got huge and beat everyone up!

1258
01:12:00,997 --> 01:12:03,381
And we still haven't heard from the rest of the crew.

1259
01:12:03,446 --> 01:12:04,697
Thanks, Chopper.

1260
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:06,257
You can put me down now.

1261
01:12:06,561 --> 01:12:07,368
Huh?

1262
01:12:08,905 --> 01:12:10,587
Wait, are you sure about this?

1263
01:12:10,612 --> 01:12:12,636
You guys head back to the Sunny, okay?

1264
01:12:13,121 --> 01:12:15,450
And don't worry. I'll be fine.

1265
01:12:17,136 --> 01:12:18,214
Luffy.

1266
01:12:18,523 --> 01:12:19,286
Usopp.

1267
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:22,623
Luffy.

1268
01:12:23,822 --> 01:12:26,555
Hey, thanks for saving me back there.

1269
01:12:26,613 --> 01:12:28,256
Just hold on a little bit longer...

1270
01:12:28,281 --> 01:12:29,288
I'm sorry!

1271
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:33,707
Every time... when it really matters...

1272
01:12:34,985 --> 01:12:36,256
...I'm useless.

1273
01:12:36,822 --> 01:12:38,784
I'm not strong enough at all.

1274
01:12:39,543 --> 01:12:40,397
I just...

1275
01:12:40,849 --> 01:12:43,337
I don't even deserve to be on your crew!

1276
01:12:43,863 --> 01:12:45,555
I'm so sorry, Luffy!

1277
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:47,081
I tried!

1278
01:12:47,482 --> 01:12:48,884
I just want to...

1279
01:12:49,573 --> 01:12:50,766
Hey, hang in there!

1280
01:12:50,877 --> 01:12:53,229
It's okay! That's enough!

1281
01:12:55,843 --> 01:12:58,148
Chopper, take care of him for me.

1282
01:12:58,796 --> 01:12:59,594
You're going?

1283
01:12:59,619 --> 01:13:02,350
We haven't lost yet, okay, Usopp?

1284
01:13:04,144 --> 01:13:08,039
So instead of being sorry, hold out for a victory.

1285
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:16,966
Time to go!

1286
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:28,027
With your power versus mine,
this fight will go on forever!

1287
01:13:28,166 --> 01:13:31,493
Then you'll just have to give up so I can do my job!

1288
01:13:31,613 --> 01:13:34,384
Coming through! Watch out!

1289
01:13:39,066 --> 01:13:40,667
Thank you for leading the way.

1290
01:13:40,831 --> 01:13:43,402
Now, can you two tell me where to find Luffy?

1291
01:13:43,867 --> 01:13:45,425
Another Warlord?

1292
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:50,930
And another one!

1293
01:13:51,117 --> 01:13:53,760
Do you wanna tell me what you three are planning?

1294
01:13:54,561 --> 01:13:56,047
First of all, calm down.

1295
01:13:56,196 --> 01:13:58,033
And second, we're not planning anything...

1296
01:13:58,071 --> 01:13:59,941
or at least not planning anything together.

1297
01:13:59,966 --> 01:14:00,513
Huh?

1298
01:14:00,777 --> 01:14:03,421
I've got business with Festa, assuming we survive.

1299
01:14:03,446 --> 01:14:04,717
Everyone shut up!

1300
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:06,830
We're gonna get blown up if we don't book it!

1301
01:14:07,055 --> 01:14:09,046
You can work out your stupid problems later!

1302
01:14:09,071 --> 01:14:10,524
No one cares!

1303
01:14:10,549 --> 01:14:12,398
There is only one thing that matters here!

1304
01:14:12,423 --> 01:14:14,088
I inquired about Luffy's whereabouts

1305
01:14:14,113 --> 01:14:15,296
and I demand an answer!

1306
01:14:15,321 --> 01:14:17,770
What is your damage, lady?! Get off of me!

1307
01:14:18,847 --> 01:14:19,399
Huh?

1308
01:14:19,996 --> 01:14:22,308
Time is up. Out of my way.

1309
01:14:22,827 --> 01:14:24,802
This conversation's over.

1310
01:14:25,254 --> 01:14:27,703
Not the most dependable alliance, I suppose.

1311
01:14:27,822 --> 01:14:28,282
Huh?

1312
01:14:28,884 --> 01:14:30,945
If you don't wanna die, listen to me.

1313
01:14:31,174 --> 01:14:34,312
I have a strategy that should
break Bullet out of that shell of his.

1314
01:14:34,546 --> 01:14:36,091
You tryin' to be flashy?

1315
01:14:36,116 --> 01:14:39,230
I already told you, the only
way to survive is to run away!

1316
01:14:40,021 --> 01:14:43,631
Oh, damn it. Sea Prism Stone.

1317
01:14:43,697 --> 01:14:44,972
I'm listening.

1318
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:46,715
We'll only have one shot.

1319
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:48,835
His punch can split an island in half.

1320
01:14:48,939 --> 01:14:50,519
You'll have to follow me closely.

1321
01:14:50,697 --> 01:14:53,697
Following a pirate on some suicide mission?

1322
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:54,928
No thank you!

1323
01:14:55,113 --> 01:14:57,065
I'm telling you, there's no other way.

1324
01:14:57,196 --> 01:14:58,916
I'll just do this on my own.

1325
01:15:00,988 --> 01:15:02,039
Wait a sec.

1326
01:15:02,196 --> 01:15:03,253
It's Luffy!

1327
01:15:04,947 --> 01:15:08,038
Where are you, Bullet?!

1328
01:15:13,071 --> 01:15:15,277
So you survived after all, huh?

1329
01:15:15,429 --> 01:15:17,747
Now that's what I'm talking about!

1330
01:15:18,138 --> 01:15:19,979
Now, Gum-Gum...

1331
01:15:21,947 --> 01:15:24,200
...Kong Gun!

1332
01:15:35,806 --> 01:15:38,818
Were you trying to fly straight into his fist?

1333
01:15:39,689 --> 01:15:40,741
Luffy!

1334
01:15:41,697 --> 01:15:43,251
Oh, how I've longed to see you!

1335
01:15:43,276 --> 01:15:44,552
That was some punch!

1336
01:15:44,577 --> 01:15:45,838
Please, just look at me!

1337
01:15:45,863 --> 01:15:48,112
Hey, Hancock. Long time no see!

1338
01:15:48,137 --> 01:15:49,368
Have you been okay?

1339
01:15:49,458 --> 01:15:53,111
Ah! Even injured, he's still worried about me!

1340
01:15:53,435 --> 01:15:55,732
I can die without regret.

1341
01:15:55,964 --> 01:15:58,829
Oh, Traffy! Hey, pal. You're looking better!

1342
01:15:58,854 --> 01:16:00,530
I'll be better when this is done.

1343
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:01,506
Let's team up.

1344
01:16:01,721 --> 01:16:03,659
I've got a plan to drag Bullet out.

1345
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:05,702
Whoa, really? Sounds great!

1346
01:16:08,905 --> 01:16:10,858
Hey! I didn't even explain!

1347
01:16:11,113 --> 01:16:12,891
Sabo! And Smokey!

1348
01:16:12,916 --> 01:16:13,949
'Sup, Luffy?

1349
01:16:14,405 --> 01:16:15,863
All right, let's do it!

1350
01:16:15,927 --> 01:16:17,029
Let me warn you.

1351
01:16:17,113 --> 01:16:19,232
If we blow this, we're all as good as dead.

1352
01:16:19,446 --> 01:16:22,768
Why would we blow it? We got an awesome team here.

1353
01:16:23,154 --> 01:16:25,311
And there's no use worrying, anyway.

1354
01:16:25,488 --> 01:16:25,994
Huh?

1355
01:16:28,113 --> 01:16:30,380
You work out the complicated stuff, Traffy.

1356
01:16:30,405 --> 01:16:31,411
You're good at that.

1357
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:35,558
As long as I get to punch him.

1358
01:16:36,384 --> 01:16:38,421
All right. Guess I'll help you.

1359
01:16:38,446 --> 01:16:42,168
I'll follow you anywhere, my love, just name the place.

1360
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:45,301
There's no time to discuss it, anyway.

1361
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:49,154
Let's go!

1362
01:17:09,238 --> 01:17:10,629
Well, that's a sight!

1363
01:17:10,738 --> 01:17:14,321
A pirate, a Marine, Warlords, and a Revolutionary.

1364
01:17:14,405 --> 01:17:16,379
Quite the ragtag group you've got.

1365
01:17:16,446 --> 01:17:18,230
Well, it ain't gonna change a thing!

1366
01:17:27,613 --> 01:17:29,338
Straw Hat, not yet!

1367
01:17:29,988 --> 01:17:30,982
Luffy!

1368
01:17:31,238 --> 01:17:33,571
I'm coming for you!

1369
01:17:33,655 --> 01:17:36,718
Dammit, if you're gonna agree to
my plan, at least hear me out first!

1370
01:17:37,168 --> 01:17:39,070
Well, you can tell me, at least.

1371
01:17:39,506 --> 01:17:42,011
Bullet's Haki is our biggest obstacle here.

1372
01:17:42,154 --> 01:17:44,071
But all we have to do is make a crack.

1373
01:17:44,154 --> 01:17:45,809
I'll take care of that with my power.

1374
01:17:46,113 --> 01:17:49,678
Then I need you guys to attack the
opening and whittle down his outer shell.

1375
01:17:49,905 --> 01:17:51,673
You really think that's gonna be enough?

1376
01:17:52,317 --> 01:17:54,762
The fewer things he controls, the weaker he is.

1377
01:17:54,905 --> 01:17:59,108
It won't be easy, but I think we can finish him
off before he can build his armor a second time.

1378
01:17:59,190 --> 01:18:01,348
I can only make that crack once, though.

1379
01:18:01,738 --> 01:18:04,820
Doesn't sound like much of a plan, but what can I say?

1380
01:18:05,286 --> 01:18:07,957
Now, Gum-Gum!

1381
01:18:11,875 --> 01:18:14,354
I like your pluck, kid, but come on,

1382
01:18:14,646 --> 01:18:16,640
that's not gonna cut it!

1383
01:18:23,363 --> 01:18:24,244
Oh, no!

1384
01:18:27,655 --> 01:18:29,052
Could someone stop him?

1385
01:18:29,116 --> 01:18:31,112
Moron. He'll never learn.

1386
01:18:32,462 --> 01:18:34,424
He really is strong.

1387
01:18:35,055 --> 01:18:37,450
Guess I can't beat him like that, after all!

1388
01:18:37,571 --> 01:18:38,983
Okay, then.

1389
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:41,668
You're nothing but a bunch of insects.

1390
01:18:41,738 --> 01:18:44,630
But that's fine, I'm happy crushing you all!

1391
01:18:44,718 --> 01:18:48,841
The Navy, pirates, or anyone
who dares to stand against me.

1392
01:18:48,919 --> 01:18:51,583
I'll eradicate every last one of you!

1393
01:18:51,718 --> 01:18:55,419
Strong as he was, even Roger
wasn't able to accomplish that!

1394
01:18:55,901 --> 01:18:59,053
Then everyone will know I'm the strongest!

1395
01:19:00,018 --> 01:19:00,991
Spread out!

1396
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:03,684
Follow Straw Hat!

1397
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:05,853
When I use my power, that's the sign!

1398
01:19:10,530 --> 01:19:13,028
If you're Luffy's friends, then I can trust you!

1399
01:19:13,145 --> 01:19:14,959
Friend might be a strong word.

1400
01:19:16,321 --> 01:19:18,557
And this is gonna play out, just like you said?

1401
01:19:20,822 --> 01:19:22,697
Are we doin' this or not?

1402
01:19:22,835 --> 01:19:24,585
Quit your yapping and hurry up.

1403
01:19:24,675 --> 01:19:25,818
Fine. As planned,

1404
01:19:25,863 --> 01:19:29,497
I'll provoke his transformation, and you... Hey!

1405
01:19:30,321 --> 01:19:32,505
Not once, but twice you struck him!

1406
01:19:32,530 --> 01:19:34,947
A crime that you shall pay for a thousand-fold!

1407
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:38,229
Even death is too great a mercy for one such as you!

1408
01:19:38,363 --> 01:19:40,651
Tch! Can't rely on anyone!

1409
01:19:42,463 --> 01:19:44,196
I'll strike you down!

1410
01:19:48,196 --> 01:19:50,254
Perfume Femur.

1411
01:19:50,406 --> 01:19:52,019
Magna!

1412
01:19:55,530 --> 01:19:57,176
He's harder than I thought!

1413
01:20:00,613 --> 01:20:02,738
I hope you've enjoyed yourselves,

1414
01:20:02,817 --> 01:20:06,084
because it's all about to come crashing down!

1415
01:20:06,897 --> 01:20:08,681
Actually, this might work out just fine!

1416
01:20:08,738 --> 01:20:10,023
Pathetic.

1417
01:20:10,429 --> 01:20:12,502
Ground Death!

1418
01:20:16,021 --> 01:20:18,810
And Sables!

1419
01:20:31,308 --> 01:20:32,221
Crocodile?

1420
01:20:32,413 --> 01:20:35,551
After all this time, you're still just a pile of junk!

1421
01:20:37,032 --> 01:20:38,637
This is a surprise!

1422
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:41,775
Well, if you came here to die, too, then be my guest!

1423
01:20:41,884 --> 01:20:43,101
All right, Room!

1424
01:20:45,988 --> 01:20:46,535
Huh?

1425
01:20:46,901 --> 01:20:48,289
And Shambles!

1426
01:20:53,049 --> 01:20:55,607
Seems you're all brawn and no brains.

1427
01:20:55,670 --> 01:20:57,683
Now time for the real fight.

1428
01:20:58,198 --> 01:21:01,194
If I wanna beat his power, this is all I've got!

1429
01:21:10,113 --> 01:21:14,485
Clever, but a petty trick like
this will barely even slow me down!

1430
01:21:14,649 --> 01:21:17,163
You think I can't absorb the debris again?

1431
01:21:17,323 --> 01:21:20,198
My Armament Haki is coming back already!

1432
01:21:20,755 --> 01:21:21,834
That's our cue!

1433
01:21:22,075 --> 01:21:23,931
All right, Marine. Let's go!

1434
01:21:23,956 --> 01:21:25,695
I don't take orders from you!

1435
01:21:27,845 --> 01:21:30,011
White Blow!

1436
01:21:31,479 --> 01:21:33,451
Burning Dragon Claw Fist!

1437
01:21:33,883 --> 01:21:35,651
Flame Dragon King!

1438
01:21:46,682 --> 01:21:47,353
What?

1439
01:21:47,922 --> 01:21:49,036
Nice, Smokey!

1440
01:21:49,061 --> 01:21:49,934
You little!

1441
01:21:50,362 --> 01:21:51,905
I thought we made a good team!

1442
01:21:54,655 --> 01:21:56,409
Still not enough!

1443
01:22:03,152 --> 01:22:04,774
Ow. Ow. Damn it!

1444
01:22:04,822 --> 01:22:06,340
Ya buncha little punks.

1445
01:22:06,429 --> 01:22:08,476
Agh! It's always you!

1446
01:22:08,688 --> 01:22:12,577
I woulda been off this island already if you
and your stupid friends hadn't found me, Straw Hat!

1447
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:14,630
And how dare you disrespect a Warlord?

1448
01:22:14,655 --> 01:22:16,606
I am gonna sock you one good.

1449
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:18,011
Huh?

1450
01:22:20,214 --> 01:22:21,963
And now I got crap falling on me?

1451
01:22:21,988 --> 01:22:22,977
Gimme a damn break!

1452
01:22:23,002 --> 01:22:24,880
The legend of Buggy is just getting started!

1453
01:22:24,952 --> 01:22:27,505
I didn't claw my way to the top
just to get crushed under some junk!

1454
01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:31,628
I'm not gonna die in some wasteland buried
under trash where no one will ever find me!

1455
01:22:31,772 --> 01:22:33,781
Although I guess it was a good life.

1456
01:22:33,873 --> 01:22:36,189
Thank you, Mother, for bringing me into this world.

1457
01:22:36,709 --> 01:22:38,333
Don't bury yourself yet, Buggy!

1458
01:22:38,363 --> 01:22:41,257
You got flashy tales of fancy yet to tell!

1459
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:45,214
Wait a sec. Speaking of flashy, I
still have my famous weapon to use!

1460
01:22:45,337 --> 01:22:46,500
Special attack!

1461
01:22:46,587 --> 01:22:48,941
C'mon, Muggy Ball!

1462
01:22:57,949 --> 01:22:58,664
What?

1463
01:23:03,621 --> 01:23:07,476
Cipher Pol showed up, too? Buncha Government dogs!

1464
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:15,672
Oh, yeah, I'm totally that strong!

1465
01:23:15,697 --> 01:23:16,914
I knew that would happen!

1466
01:23:19,822 --> 01:23:21,095
How is this happening?

1467
01:23:21,222 --> 01:23:22,992
This guy's the heir to Roger's strength.

1468
01:23:23,029 --> 01:23:24,938
He's s'posed to be invincible, right?

1469
01:23:25,519 --> 01:23:28,878
Amazing. But the real battle's
just getting started, isn't it?

1470
01:23:28,942 --> 01:23:29,697
Probably.

1471
01:23:29,722 --> 01:23:31,655
But it's nothing that Luffy can't handle.

1472
01:23:31,729 --> 01:23:33,725
We just need to get back to the Sunny.

1473
01:23:35,023 --> 01:23:37,284
Robin, sorry! I'll catch up in a second!

1474
01:23:37,879 --> 01:23:38,601
Huh?

1475
01:23:41,019 --> 01:23:43,735
That's not even going to slow me down!

1476
01:23:45,602 --> 01:23:46,930
Everyone, get back!

1477
01:23:47,102 --> 01:23:49,928
I don't need two arms to crush you!

1478
01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:54,447
I'm sorry!

1479
01:23:56,571 --> 01:23:59,619
Anything else you wanna try before you're dead?

1480
01:24:01,875 --> 01:24:03,571
We're finished. Damn it!

1481
01:24:03,655 --> 01:24:04,456
Not yet!

1482
01:24:04,563 --> 01:24:06,922
If we trim him down one more time Luffy can win!

1483
01:24:06,947 --> 01:24:08,259
Come on! Hurry!

1484
01:24:08,708 --> 01:24:09,904
What're you, crazy?

1485
01:24:10,530 --> 01:24:11,363
Well, damn.

1486
01:24:11,446 --> 01:24:12,493
Luffy!

1487
01:24:16,488 --> 01:24:18,154
All right! Let's follow him!

1488
01:24:18,756 --> 01:24:19,600
What's that?

1489
01:24:19,655 --> 01:24:21,004
Bleh! That was close!

1490
01:24:21,037 --> 01:24:22,857
I think that's enough for today, thanks!

1491
01:24:41,756 --> 01:24:42,607
Again?

1492
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:45,459
I'll swat you away like flies!

1493
01:24:46,556 --> 01:24:48,002
How 'bout this, then?

1494
01:24:48,261 --> 01:24:48,867
Huh?

1495
01:24:50,162 --> 01:24:52,023
Not gonna die! Not gonna die!

1496
01:25:05,497 --> 01:25:10,439
Oh, you think you're pretty clever, don't you?

1497
01:25:10,724 --> 01:25:14,849
I'll destroy this whole island and you along with it!

1498
01:25:15,114 --> 01:25:16,547
What now, genius?

1499
01:25:16,572 --> 01:25:18,337
I didn't think that he'd still able to move!

1500
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:31,518
Bullet!

1501
01:25:31,748 --> 01:25:35,205
This time, I won't lose!

1502
01:25:38,488 --> 01:25:41,776
You think you can beat me, just because you won't give up?

1503
01:25:44,478 --> 01:25:47,345
Looks like I'll have to put you in your place!

1504
01:25:47,370 --> 01:25:49,720
Now, Gum-Gum...

1505
01:25:50,446 --> 01:25:52,446
...King-King...

1506
01:25:53,571 --> 01:25:57,744
Ultimate Faust!

1507
01:25:58,196 --> 01:26:03,908
...King Kong Gun!

1508
01:26:21,837 --> 01:26:22,561
No!

1509
01:26:45,794 --> 01:26:47,478
That wasn't bad!

1510
01:26:47,889 --> 01:26:49,686
But still not enough!

1511
01:26:52,046 --> 01:26:52,960
What's he doing?

1512
01:26:52,985 --> 01:26:53,905
I'm not sure!

1513
01:26:53,930 --> 01:26:56,074
If only you were a bit stronger!

1514
01:26:56,229 --> 01:26:58,798
But there's only room for one at the top!

1515
01:27:00,279 --> 01:27:02,374
Huh? What the hell?

1516
01:27:09,599 --> 01:27:11,192
He's falling apart!

1517
01:27:13,071 --> 01:27:17,501
Special... Green Star... Snake Fireworks.

1518
01:27:17,553 --> 01:27:20,377
They're set off by a strong impact.

1519
01:27:20,716 --> 01:27:24,190
Snipers are here for support, after all.

1520
01:27:26,822 --> 01:27:28,520
Bullet! No!

1521
01:27:28,698 --> 01:27:32,004
All my hard work undone by some
moron with a giant rubber fist.

1522
01:27:32,029 --> 01:27:33,756
This can't be the end of me!

1523
01:27:35,655 --> 01:27:36,744
Took long enough.

1524
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:38,817
That treasure's mine!

1525
01:27:41,309 --> 01:27:41,803
Huh?

1526
01:27:46,571 --> 01:27:47,748
Outta the way.

1527
01:27:47,893 --> 01:27:49,843
That belongs to Luffy!

1528
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,699
I'm going to crush you!

1529
01:27:55,184 --> 01:27:57,870
Now, finally, it's one on one!

1530
01:27:59,019 --> 01:28:00,463
Awfully cocky!

1531
01:28:00,504 --> 01:28:02,397
You think I can't win in a fist fight?

1532
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:04,701
I hope you've got something to show!

1533
01:28:05,196 --> 01:28:07,683
You don't have to keep reminding me that you're strong!

1534
01:28:07,822 --> 01:28:09,437
It doesn't matter anyway,

1535
01:28:09,462 --> 01:28:11,701
'cause I'm still gonna surpass you!

1536
01:28:13,389 --> 01:28:15,364
All my friends are here!

1537
01:28:17,363 --> 01:28:20,099
And they're counting on me!

1538
01:28:23,373 --> 01:28:24,668
Your friends?

1539
01:28:30,613 --> 01:28:33,503
There's no room for friends on a battlefield!

1540
01:28:34,673 --> 01:28:39,374
Only conviction, and faith in
yourself alone can save you out here!

1541
01:28:45,113 --> 01:28:47,922
And that's why you'll never defeat me!

1542
01:28:58,655 --> 01:29:01,477
I wield the greatest power on these seas!

1543
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:03,591
I am the world's strongest man!

1544
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:05,377
And that's why...

1545
01:29:05,748 --> 01:29:07,839
...I am the King of the Pirates!

1546
01:29:07,930 --> 01:29:11,107
Even if you're strong, you don't get it at all!

1547
01:29:11,321 --> 01:29:13,807
I'll just have to show you!

1548
01:29:13,832 --> 01:29:16,221
I'm gonna bury you, boy!

1549
01:29:16,246 --> 01:29:18,032
Gum-Gum King Kong...

1550
01:29:18,057 --> 01:29:20,321
Der Starkste...

1551
01:29:20,813 --> 01:29:22,727
...Gatling!

1552
01:29:22,752 --> 01:29:24,231
...Strike!

1553
01:29:39,738 --> 01:29:44,301
The only reason I've been able to grow this
strong is because I learned to rely on myself!

1554
01:29:44,326 --> 01:29:47,327
On these seas, that's all you can do!

1555
01:29:53,367 --> 01:29:54,899
Shut up!

1556
01:29:55,130 --> 01:29:57,988
You never would've made it
this far if you were really alone!

1557
01:29:58,078 --> 01:30:00,006
You forgot who helped you!

1558
01:30:04,774 --> 01:30:06,100
You're strong.

1559
01:30:07,253 --> 01:30:08,874
But mark my words.

1560
01:30:08,905 --> 01:30:11,046
Someday, I'll become even stronger.

1561
01:30:11,071 --> 01:30:13,496
Then we'll see who's the King of these seas,

1562
01:30:14,113 --> 01:30:15,165
Roger.

1563
01:30:15,822 --> 01:30:19,751
Challenge me any time. I love a good fight.

1564
01:30:20,405 --> 01:30:22,222
Same as you, Bullet.

1565
01:30:45,541 --> 01:30:49,251
I'm gonna be the King of the Pirates!

1566
01:30:49,339 --> 01:30:52,516
Do you hear me?!

1567
01:31:23,613 --> 01:31:24,566
Luffy!

1568
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,228
Please tell me you're all right!

1569
01:31:27,905 --> 01:31:30,082
Well, I got the treasure.

1570
01:31:30,406 --> 01:31:31,153
So, uh...

1571
01:31:32,589 --> 01:31:34,378
...I guess we won the game!

1572
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:48,924
This can't be happening.

1573
01:32:01,279 --> 01:32:03,440
Luffy, what is this box?

1574
01:32:03,671 --> 01:32:05,307
It's the Pirate King's treasure.

1575
01:32:05,466 --> 01:32:07,579
No idea what's inside, though.

1576
01:32:07,655 --> 01:32:09,358
Oh, it's one of these things.

1577
01:32:10,106 --> 01:32:11,615
I can't believe my eyes!

1578
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:13,840
That's an Eternal Pose to Laugh Tale!

1579
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:15,152
Wait, to Laugh Tale?

1580
01:32:15,187 --> 01:32:17,511
This is it! You've found the way.

1581
01:32:19,655 --> 01:32:20,410
What is it?

1582
01:32:20,697 --> 01:32:22,296
Hand it over, Straw Hat!

1583
01:32:22,321 --> 01:32:23,748
That's mine!

1584
01:32:27,608 --> 01:32:29,150
You bastard.

1585
01:32:29,571 --> 01:32:31,548
Do you realize what you've done?

1586
01:32:32,894 --> 01:32:34,346
I'll make it on my own.

1587
01:32:35,342 --> 01:32:36,736
Not this way.

1588
01:32:42,201 --> 01:32:44,601
No surprise coming from you.

1589
01:32:46,146 --> 01:32:47,598
Hey! Luffy!

1590
01:32:49,122 --> 01:32:52,463
Good luck surviving the Buster Call, you dimwits!

1591
01:32:52,516 --> 01:32:56,838
How's that for a finale? Everyone gets roasted alive!

1592
01:32:59,022 --> 01:33:01,145
We've had our eyes on you this whole time.

1593
01:33:01,390 --> 01:33:02,422
It hasn't been pretty.

1594
01:33:03,373 --> 01:33:05,561
You call yourself Festival Master,

1595
01:33:05,655 --> 01:33:08,137
but you're really nothing but a warmonger, aren't you?

1596
01:33:08,771 --> 01:33:10,352
Right, Buena Festa?

1597
01:33:11,416 --> 01:33:12,855
A Revolutionary, huh?

1598
01:33:13,205 --> 01:33:14,411
I should've known.

1599
01:33:15,472 --> 01:33:19,163
Huh. So this little operation
with Straw Hat and his friends,

1600
01:33:19,196 --> 01:33:20,489
was that your doing?

1601
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:23,183
No, we just got lucky, actually.

1602
01:33:24,019 --> 01:33:26,884
Or rather, Luffy inspired us to work as a team.

1603
01:33:28,803 --> 01:33:29,950
Fire Fist!

1604
01:33:38,296 --> 01:33:40,376
So that's Straw Hat's power.

1605
01:33:40,714 --> 01:33:43,584
Inspiring his friends and enemies, too.

1606
01:33:44,130 --> 01:33:46,604
Then he makes the impossible possible.

1607
01:33:47,247 --> 01:33:48,877
He could bring a new era.

1608
01:33:49,655 --> 01:33:52,483
A man like that could become King of the Pirates.

1609
01:33:53,023 --> 01:33:53,991
A pity.

1610
01:33:54,321 --> 01:33:57,647
I guess I bet on the wrong guy, didn't I?

1611
01:33:58,238 --> 01:33:59,712
I wouldn't beat yourself up.

1612
01:33:59,822 --> 01:34:01,889
It's not like he would team up with you, anyway.

1613
01:34:11,661 --> 01:34:14,902
Robin found a way out, but this is a real mess.

1614
01:34:15,154 --> 01:34:16,436
Do we break through?

1615
01:34:16,697 --> 01:34:19,194
They're gonna start the Buster Call any second now.

1616
01:34:26,575 --> 01:34:28,259
We gotta figure out something!

1617
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:30,412
Uh! We're like rats in a trap.

1618
01:34:37,238 --> 01:34:39,849
I call dibs on the whole fleet, you hear me?

1619
01:34:39,874 --> 01:34:43,855
I'm sinking every last one! All you, stay outta my way!

1620
01:34:49,321 --> 01:34:50,440
Well, that'll work!

1621
01:34:50,530 --> 01:34:52,466
Franky! Let's go for it!

1622
01:34:52,530 --> 01:34:55,182
Y'ready, Sunny?!

1623
01:35:01,988 --> 01:35:02,913
Quick favor.

1624
01:35:03,377 --> 01:35:04,781
Use your power on this.

1625
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:09,183
We're stuck! They're blockin'
us! We'll tear through! Keep going!

1626
01:35:14,617 --> 01:35:15,831
Oh, no!

1627
01:35:16,029 --> 01:35:16,928
Kizaru!

1628
01:35:17,435 --> 01:35:19,759
Yasakani Sacred Jewel.

1629
01:35:20,018 --> 01:35:21,648
Here comes the pain!

1630
01:35:24,398 --> 01:35:25,955
Fire fist!

1631
01:35:29,488 --> 01:35:31,228
Message from Vice Admiral Smoker!

1632
01:35:31,864 --> 01:35:35,197
"The Pirate King's treasure has
been destroyed by Straw Hat Luffy.

1633
01:35:35,321 --> 01:35:37,405
Many Marines are still trapped on the island!"

1634
01:35:37,448 --> 01:35:40,239
I request that you cancel the Buster Call immediately."

1635
01:35:40,363 --> 01:35:43,822
Repeat: I request that you
cancel the Buster Call immediately.

1636
01:35:43,928 --> 01:35:45,302
It's blocking the enemy.

1637
01:35:45,363 --> 01:35:46,651
We can escape now.

1638
01:35:46,956 --> 01:35:49,336
Waiting for the order, Luffy! Ready?

1639
01:36:05,172 --> 01:36:07,148
Until next time, brother.

1640
01:36:07,968 --> 01:36:11,505
No complaints from me! Let's go!

1641
01:36:11,554 --> 01:36:12,718
Yeah!

1642
01:39:29,738 --> 01:39:31,960
You made an Eternal Pose?

1643
01:39:32,231 --> 01:39:34,630
If that's a joke, then I'm not laughing!

1644
01:39:34,695 --> 01:39:36,194
We did it just in case!

1645
01:39:36,293 --> 01:39:37,972
I mean, what if we wanna come back?

1646
01:39:38,121 --> 01:39:39,955
There is no coming back.

1647
01:39:40,029 --> 01:39:41,109
Don't you get it?

1648
01:39:41,196 --> 01:39:43,359
We've reached the end of our journey.

1649
01:39:43,823 --> 01:39:45,327
And the treasure we've left?

1650
01:39:45,525 --> 01:39:49,092
Well, it's far beyond the reach
of someone who would use this.

1651
01:39:49,170 --> 01:39:53,097
Aw, Captain, now you've done it!

1652
01:39:55,892 --> 01:39:59,182
Perhaps, we were a bit before our time.

1653
01:40:00,065 --> 01:40:04,402
I do wonder who will find One Piece in the end.

1654
01:40:04,538 --> 01:40:06,622
Why, my son, obviously!

1655
01:40:06,706 --> 01:40:08,223
You don't have a son!

1656
01:40:08,315 --> 01:40:10,550
Not yet, but I got one on the way!

1657
01:40:14,947 --> 01:40:16,821
What?

1658
01:40:16,905 --> 01:40:18,488
You broke Roger's treasure?!

1659
01:40:18,571 --> 01:40:20,745
So you didn't want the Eternal Pose?

1660
01:40:20,770 --> 01:40:21,484
Nuh-uh!

1661
01:40:21,714 --> 01:40:25,822
Are you even trying to get to One Piece
anymore, or is this just a big game to you?!

1662
01:40:25,865 --> 01:40:28,570
What good does destroying it
do? You could have asked us first!

1663
01:40:29,547 --> 01:40:31,112
Well, that's no surprise!

1664
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:33,458
Like Luffy would have it any other way!

1665
01:40:33,655 --> 01:40:35,563
Seems crazy, but whatever.

1666
01:40:38,831 --> 01:40:41,728
If we took a short cut, who knows what we'd miss out on!

1667
01:40:41,795 --> 01:40:45,676
There's all sorts of amazing stuff out
there and I wanna share it all with you guys!

1668
01:40:45,764 --> 01:40:47,033
What are we waiting for?

1669
01:40:47,132 --> 01:40:49,672
One party's over, so let's look for the next one!

1670
01:40:49,796 --> 01:40:52,088
Set sail for adventure!

1671
01:40:52,113 --> 01:40:53,653
Yeah!
