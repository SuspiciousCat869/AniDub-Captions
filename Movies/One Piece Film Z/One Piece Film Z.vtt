00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:18.179 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm mature! Lemme try.

00:11:18.212 --> 00:11:19.813 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CHOPPER]
Uh.

00:11:19.847 --> 00:11:21.415 position:41% line:89% align:start
Gross.

00:11:21.448 --> 00:11:22.983 position:24% line:83% align:start
Should I tell them
that pesticides

00:11:23.017 --> 00:11:26.153 position:10% line:89% align:start
are harmful to humans, too?

00:11:26.187 --> 00:11:28.489 position:19% line:83% align:start
Captain Cherry Tree's
leadin' his troops away!

00:11:28.523 --> 00:11:31.492 position:5% line:89% align:start
C'mon! Off to the north, fellas!

00:11:31.526 --> 00:11:34.061 position:21% line:83% align:start
Look! Captain Cherry
Tree is on the move.

00:11:34.094 --> 00:11:36.497 position:19% line:83% align:start
Stop him or the cherry
blossom season will end.

00:11:36.531 --> 00:11:39.800 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey! I'm the captain here!
Stop right there!

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:41.402 position:38% line:83% align:start
[FRANKY]
About face, fellas! March!

00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:43.037 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
He's changing directions!

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:47.308 position:19% line:83% align:start
[NAMI] Ugh, could you
shut up for five minutes?

00:11:47.341 --> 00:11:50.244 position:13% line:83% align:start
Just turn down the stupid
and relax for once, okay?

00:11:50.277 --> 00:11:51.245 position:33% line:89% align:start
So annoying.

00:11:51.278 --> 00:11:53.447 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey! You're disturbing
the lady, you idiots!

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.316 position:19% line:89% align:start
Ugh, they're hopeless.

00:11:55.349 --> 00:11:57.519 position:16% line:89% align:start
Not like you, Nami-swan!

00:11:57.552 --> 00:11:59.153 position:5% line:89% align:start
And here's your orange special.

00:11:59.186 --> 00:12:02.122 position:10% line:89% align:start
Thanks, Sanji. Looks great.

00:12:02.156 --> 00:12:04.792 position:10% line:83% align:start
You wouldn't happen to have
any dessert, would you?

00:12:04.825 --> 00:12:07.795 position:33% line:83% align:start
I don't yet,
but it's on the way!

00:12:07.828 --> 00:12:09.830 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Hey, Sanji!

00:12:09.863 --> 00:12:12.766 position:19% line:83% align:start
Make me some dessert,
too, wouldja? With meat!

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.402 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, I'll have some, too,
without the meat, if you will.

00:12:15.436 --> 00:12:16.370 position:38% line:89% align:start
Me, too!

00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:18.105 position:10% line:89% align:start
Just some cola for me, bro!

00:12:18.138 --> 00:12:19.974 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey, we're not outta
booze yet, are we?

00:12:20.007 --> 00:12:21.842 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
Did somebody say "dessert"?

00:12:21.875 --> 00:12:24.278 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SANJI] You can shut up and
fix your own damned dessert

00:12:24.311 --> 00:12:25.412 position:19% line:89% align:start
if you want it so bad!

00:12:25.446 --> 00:12:26.548 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ya got it?!

00:12:26.581 --> 00:12:31.218 position:13% line:83% align:start
And besides, I was born to
serve the ladies, not you!

00:12:31.252 --> 00:12:33.087 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:40.361 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the heck?

00:12:40.394 --> 00:12:43.330 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hey, Usopp! You gettin'
poison in our food again?

00:12:43.364 --> 00:12:46.033 position:13% line:89% align:start
No! I'm all done spraying.

00:12:46.066 --> 00:12:48.369 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now what could this be?

00:12:48.402 --> 00:12:49.504 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's snow!

00:12:49.537 --> 00:12:51.839 position:13% line:83% align:start
Not really cold enough for
snow to be falling, is it?

00:12:51.872 --> 00:12:54.875 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'll figure it out.

00:12:54.908 --> 00:12:57.945 position:16% line:89% align:start
This is... volcanic ash.

00:12:57.978 --> 00:13:00.314 position:38% line:83% align:start
[OTHERS]
Volcanic ash?

00:15:09.677 --> 00:15:11.546 position:24% line:89% align:start
[thunder rumbles]

00:15:14.248 --> 00:15:18.218 position:27% line:83% align:start
I got that stuff
all over me! Ah!

00:15:18.252 --> 00:15:20.454 position:21% line:83% align:start
We can't leave your
fur covered in ash.

00:15:20.487 --> 00:15:22.356 position:24% line:83% align:start
We can take a bath
together later on, okay?

00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:23.223 position:38% line:89% align:start
A bath?!

00:15:23.257 --> 00:15:24.324 position:35% line:89% align:start
Together?!

00:15:24.358 --> 00:15:26.994 position:16% line:83% align:start
Today's not my bath day,
so I wasn't planning on it.

00:15:27.027 --> 00:15:30.397 position:10% line:83% align:start
But I guess it's better than
feeling gross all day, huh?

00:15:30.431 --> 00:15:32.166 position:24% line:83% align:start
Let me take a bath
with you as well!

00:15:32.199 --> 00:15:34.034 position:7% line:89% align:start
It really is quite imperative!

00:15:34.067 --> 00:15:37.004 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm filthy, too! Do you see?

00:15:37.037 --> 00:15:38.606 position:10% line:89% align:start
And look, I'm gross as well!

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.744 position:7% line:83% align:start
Why, have you ever seen a more
gross face in your entire life?

00:15:42.777 --> 00:15:45.345 position:30% line:89% align:start
[BROOK crying]

00:15:45.379 --> 00:15:48.215 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SANJI] Did you just hurt
your own feelings?

00:15:48.248 --> 00:15:49.751 position:38% line:83% align:start
[ROBIN]
Hmph!

00:15:49.784 --> 00:15:51.151 position:27% line:89% align:start
[CHOPPER gasps]

00:15:52.286 --> 00:15:53.120 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CHOPPER]
It's okay, Brook.

00:15:53.153 --> 00:15:55.222 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll take a bath
with you if you want!

00:15:55.255 --> 00:15:57.659 position:38% line:83% align:start
[BROOK]
I love you, Chopper.

00:15:57.692 --> 00:15:59.259 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey, what's up, Nami?

00:15:59.293 --> 00:16:01.428 position:21% line:83% align:start
Have you figured out
this volcano stuff yet?

00:16:01.462 --> 00:16:02.996 position:21% line:83% align:start
The needle pointing
in the direction

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:05.432 position:16% line:83% align:start
where the ash came from
started moving erratically,

00:16:05.466 --> 00:16:06.768 position:19% line:89% align:start
but that's all I know.

00:16:06.801 --> 00:16:09.069 position:27% line:83% align:start
I've never seen
anything like it.

00:16:09.102 --> 00:16:10.070 position:7% line:89% align:start
I don't know how to put this--

00:16:10.103 --> 00:16:13.173 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's like a lost child
looking for its parents.

00:16:13.207 --> 00:16:16.376 position:21% line:83% align:start
Huh? I don't get it.
How can an island be lost?

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:17.612 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Well, what if the eruption

00:16:17.645 --> 00:16:19.112 position:7% line:89% align:start
that sent all that ash flying

00:16:19.146 --> 00:16:21.549 position:16% line:83% align:start
also blew up the island
the volcano was on?

00:16:21.583 --> 00:16:23.450 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's why we can't
get a reading on it.

00:16:23.484 --> 00:16:25.319 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're sayin' the island
was there one minute,

00:16:25.352 --> 00:16:26.788 position:30% line:83% align:start
then the whole
thing's just gone?

00:16:26.821 --> 00:16:28.322 position:21% line:89% align:start
Sounds crazy to me.

00:16:28.355 --> 00:16:30.491 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is the New World, you know.

00:16:30.525 --> 00:16:32.392 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SANJI] You need to clean
those cherry blossoms

00:16:32.426 --> 00:16:33.628 position:24% line:89% align:start
out of your ears.

00:16:33.661 --> 00:16:36.163 position:19% line:83% align:start
Nami's beautiful brain
is always right.

00:16:36.196 --> 00:16:39.233 position:21% line:83% align:start
Even you know that.
And here's your tea, my dear.

00:16:39.266 --> 00:16:40.802 position:27% line:89% align:start
Why, thank you.

00:16:40.835 --> 00:16:42.704 position:19% line:83% align:start
In any case, whatever
happened out there,

00:16:42.737 --> 00:16:46.406 position:7% line:83% align:start
we'd better avoid that island
the needle's pointing to.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.442 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
Not so loud, Nami!

00:16:48.475 --> 00:16:52.580 position:7% line:83% align:start
Do not under any circumstances
let Luffy see this.

00:16:52.614 --> 00:16:55.717 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's my job to choose the safest
routes and to protect the crew.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:59.654 position:10% line:83% align:start
And that includes protecting
the captain from himself.

00:16:59.687 --> 00:17:01.488 position:21% line:83% align:start
Whoa, that log pose
is flippin' out!

00:17:01.523 --> 00:17:03.490 position:16% line:89% align:start
Let's go to that island!

00:17:03.525 --> 00:17:04.458 position:41% line:89% align:start
Luffy!

00:17:04.491 --> 00:17:05.660 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:17:05.693 --> 00:17:07.261 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hi! Come on!

00:17:07.294 --> 00:17:08.830 position:16% line:89% align:start
Too late! We're doomed!

00:17:08.863 --> 00:17:11.298 position:13% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] I've been itchin'
for some adventure!

00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:12.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
[USOPP] Hold on, Luffy,
you don't get it.

00:17:12.767 --> 00:17:14.536 position:7% line:89% align:start
Nami thinks a volcano blew up.

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:16.270 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's where all the ash
comes from, so even if--

00:17:16.303 --> 00:17:20.140 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hey! We know what island we're
goin' to next, you guys!

00:17:20.173 --> 00:17:21.074 position:35% line:89% align:start
Set sail!

00:17:21.108 --> 00:17:22.810 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
Luffy!

00:17:24.679 --> 00:17:26.514 position:33% line:89% align:start
[NAMI sighs]

00:17:26.548 --> 00:17:28.415 position:19% line:83% align:start
But you said yourself
we shouldn't go that way

00:17:28.448 --> 00:17:29.416 position:16% line:89% align:start
and the needle is crazy.

00:17:29.449 --> 00:17:31.753 position:16% line:83% align:start
So how would you be able
to navigate us there?

00:17:31.786 --> 00:17:35.322 position:21% line:83% align:start
That doesn't matter.
As a navigator, I have my pride.

00:17:35.355 --> 00:17:39.561 position:7% line:83% align:start
Once our goal is decided, I'll
get us there no matter what.

00:17:39.594 --> 00:17:41.094 position:19% line:89% align:start
Captain! Stand watch!

00:17:41.128 --> 00:17:44.097 position:24% line:89% align:start
Okay! You got it!

00:17:44.131 --> 00:17:47.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
Wait, you got three choices
and you're going with this one?

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.369 position:10% line:83% align:start
I know it's a gamble anyway,
but in the New World,

00:17:49.403 --> 00:17:50.872 position:16% line:83% align:start
one wrong move can mean
the difference

00:17:50.905 --> 00:17:52.205 position:16% line:89% align:start
between life and death.

00:17:52.239 --> 00:17:54.509 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey, Franky. Portside,
20 degrees.

00:17:54.542 --> 00:17:57.311 position:38% line:83% align:start
[FRANKY]
Portside, 20 degrees. Aye-aye!

00:17:57.344 --> 00:17:58.746 position:19% line:89% align:start
Nami! Don't ignore me!

00:17:58.780 --> 00:17:59.681 position:16% line:89% align:start
Rather than complaining,

00:17:59.714 --> 00:18:02.784 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'd be making preparations
if I were you.

00:18:02.817 --> 00:18:05.185 position:5% line:89% align:start
The captain's made up his mind.

00:18:05.218 --> 00:18:08.623 position:7% line:83% align:start
All we can do now is be brave
and hope for the best.

00:18:13.928 --> 00:18:15.630 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:18:17.264 --> 00:18:18.498 position:24% line:89% align:start
[CHOPPER chuckles]

00:18:18.533 --> 00:18:20.300 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:18:20.334 --> 00:18:22.604 position:7% line:83% align:start
[NAMI] But let's try to avoid
any erupting volcanoes

00:18:22.637 --> 00:18:24.271 position:30% line:83% align:start
or things that
could kill us, okay?

00:18:24.304 --> 00:18:27.274 position:24% line:83% align:start
I mean, that goes
without saying, right?

00:18:27.307 --> 00:18:29.276 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:29.309 --> 00:18:30.778 position:38% line:89% align:start
[yells]

00:18:30.812 --> 00:18:32.279 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CHOPPER]
A shipwrecked sailor!

00:18:32.312 --> 00:18:35.650 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's rescue time!

00:18:35.683 --> 00:18:38.185 position:13% line:89% align:start
Ah! He's gonna drift away!

00:18:38.218 --> 00:18:40.153 position:33% line:89% align:start
I got this!

00:18:42.255 --> 00:18:44.491 position:38% line:89% align:start
[yells]

00:18:44.525 --> 00:18:46.426 position:21% line:89% align:start
Whoa! What happened?

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:50.364 position:24% line:83% align:start
I dunno... I just
lost all my energy.

00:18:50.397 --> 00:18:52.934 position:24% line:89% align:start
[CHOPPER screams]

00:18:52.967 --> 00:18:57.304 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
And one. And two.

00:18:57.337 --> 00:18:59.741 position:21% line:83% align:start
[USOPP] Luffy, don't
let go! We have him.

00:18:59.774 --> 00:19:01.408 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yay...

00:19:01.441 --> 00:19:04.244 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
And pull!

00:19:05.345 --> 00:19:07.882 position:24% line:83% align:start
You okay? You got
your power back?

00:19:07.915 --> 00:19:09.584 position:27% line:89% align:start
[LUFFY chuckles]

00:19:10.852 --> 00:19:13.286 position:30% line:83% align:start
So how is he?
He is alive, right?

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.255 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah; his heartbeat
and breathing

00:19:15.288 --> 00:19:17.491 position:10% line:83% align:start
are a little weak right now,
but he's just unconscious,

00:19:17.525 --> 00:19:19.226 position:21% line:83% align:start
so he should recover
soon enough.

00:19:19.259 --> 00:19:20.795 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's good to hear.

00:19:20.828 --> 00:19:21.796 position:24% line:89% align:start
I hate to say it,

00:19:21.829 --> 00:19:23.965 position:19% line:83% align:start
but it looks like you
picked up trouble again.

00:19:23.998 --> 00:19:26.400 position:5% line:89% align:start
For one, he's covered in scars.

00:19:26.433 --> 00:19:27.635 position:13% line:89% align:start
And what's with that arm?

00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:29.336 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's not normal,
that's for sure.

00:19:29.369 --> 00:19:30.972 position:24% line:83% align:start
What if he starts
swinging it around?

00:19:31.005 --> 00:19:33.206 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.309 position:16% line:83% align:start
I thought so. His arm is
constructed of Sea Prism Stone.

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:37.645 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, I see!

00:19:37.679 --> 00:19:39.246 position:27% line:83% align:start
That must be why
you felt so weak

00:19:39.279 --> 00:19:40.815 position:10% line:89% align:start
when you grabbed him, Luffy.

00:19:40.848 --> 00:19:42.984 position:19% line:83% align:start
If this guy has a Sea
Prism Stone weapon,

00:19:43.017 --> 00:19:44.317 position:13% line:89% align:start
you know what that means.

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:47.254 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ALL]
Yeah! He's super awesome!

00:19:47.287 --> 00:19:49.222 position:27% line:89% align:start
Not even close!

00:19:49.256 --> 00:19:52.960 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SANJI] Sea Prism Stone gives
off the same energy as the sea.

00:19:58.265 --> 00:20:01.602 position:21% line:83% align:start
In other words, that
giant arm is a weapon.

00:20:01.636 --> 00:20:02.904 position:24% line:83% align:start
And it's designed
to fight against

00:20:02.937 --> 00:20:04.639 position:10% line:89% align:start
Devil Fruit users like you.

00:20:04.672 --> 00:20:06.607 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then there's a good
chance he's an enemy.

00:20:06.641 --> 00:20:08.009 position:27% line:83% align:start
The New World is
dangerous enough

00:20:08.042 --> 00:20:10.410 position:24% line:83% align:start
without having to
worry about this, too.

00:20:10.444 --> 00:20:12.013 position:19% line:83% align:start
[ZORO] Get rid of him
if you're that worried.

00:20:12.046 --> 00:20:14.481 position:10% line:83% align:start
[USOPP] What? You mean just
dump him back in the sea?

00:20:14.515 --> 00:20:16.349 position:21% line:89% align:start
No! I won't let you!

00:20:16.383 --> 00:20:19.787 position:13% line:83% align:start
Suit yourself, but when he
wakes up, he might kill us all.

00:20:21.288 --> 00:20:25.526 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't care! I'm a
doctor! This is my job!

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.394 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
It's fine, Chopper.

00:20:27.427 --> 00:20:29.664 position:24% line:83% align:start
You make sure he's
nice and healthy.

00:20:29.697 --> 00:20:32.900 position:10% line:83% align:start
'Cause if he tries anything,
he'll have to deal with me.

00:20:32.934 --> 00:20:34.769 position:7% line:89% align:start
That sound like a plan to you?

00:20:34.802 --> 00:20:37.471 position:7% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh! Thanks a bunch, Luffy!

00:20:37.505 --> 00:20:40.508 position:16% line:83% align:start
Whoever he is, I'm sure
we can take him no prob.

00:20:40.541 --> 00:20:41.709 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:20:41.743 --> 00:20:43.310 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:20:44.478 --> 00:20:47.548 position:27% line:83% align:start
Wow. Not a care
in the world, huh?

00:20:47.582 --> 00:20:48.549 position:33% line:89% align:start
[NAMI sighs]

00:20:48.583 --> 00:20:51.552 position:16% line:83% align:start
Still, I've got a really
bad feeling about this.

00:20:51.586 --> 00:20:53.788 position:24% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] Oh, c'mon!
This is exciting, right?

00:20:53.821 --> 00:20:57.290 position:10% line:83% align:start
[NAMI] I can do without this
kind of excitement, thank you.

00:21:05.933 --> 00:21:09.436 position:19% line:83% align:start
[CHOPPER] Luffy, look!
He's waking up! See?

00:21:09.469 --> 00:21:12.874 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah. So, what's next?

00:21:12.907 --> 00:21:14.842 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
Hey, Eyebrows. It's time.

00:21:14.876 --> 00:21:16.476 position:30% line:89% align:start
I know. Jeez.

00:21:16.511 --> 00:21:19.013 position:19% line:83% align:start
Better clean than moss
outta your head.

00:21:19.046 --> 00:21:20.380 position:21% line:89% align:start
We caught a big one.

00:21:20.413 --> 00:21:23.084 position:21% line:83% align:start
Let's see what he's
got in store for us.

00:21:23.117 --> 00:21:27.889 position:7% line:83% align:start
[CHOPPER] How are you feeling?
Don't force yourself to get up.

00:21:27.922 --> 00:21:29.690 position:33% line:83% align:start
We found you
drifting in the sea.

00:21:29.724 --> 00:21:31.491 position:7% line:89% align:start
Do you remember what happened?

00:21:31.526 --> 00:21:34.629 position:44% line:83% align:start
[Z]
Yeah, I think so.

00:21:34.662 --> 00:21:36.396 position:24% line:83% align:start
Anyway, thanks for
the treatment.

00:21:36.429 --> 00:21:37.832 position:21% line:89% align:start
You really saved me.

00:21:37.865 --> 00:21:41.468 position:7% line:83% align:start
Looks like I washed up in the
right place, huh, Doctor?

00:21:41.502 --> 00:21:42.435 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's Chopper!

00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:44.505 position:13% line:89% align:start
Good work, Doctor Chopper.

00:21:44.539 --> 00:21:46.974 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm glad I'm in
such skilled hands.

00:21:47.008 --> 00:21:50.745 position:5% line:83% align:start
Flattery won't get you anywhere
with me, you bastard!

00:21:50.778 --> 00:21:53.581 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Z] And you must be
the captain, young man.

00:21:53.614 --> 00:21:54.782 position:24% line:89% align:start
You can tell that?

00:21:54.816 --> 00:21:58.920 position:13% line:83% align:start
You bet I can. I've worked
with a lotta fellas your age.

00:21:58.953 --> 00:22:02.489 position:19% line:83% align:start
You might say I'm good
at spotting talent.

00:22:02.523 --> 00:22:04.792 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's cool. So,
what do you wanna do?

00:22:04.826 --> 00:22:06.794 position:16% line:83% align:start
You want us to drop you
off at the next island?

00:22:06.828 --> 00:22:08.428 position:44% line:83% align:start
[Z]
I have a Vivre Card.

00:22:08.461 --> 00:22:10.397 position:27% line:83% align:start
I expect my crew
should be droppin' by

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:12.499 position:10% line:89% align:start
to pick me up any time now.

00:22:13.801 --> 00:22:17.370 position:16% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] Hey, by the way.
Your arm is awesome.

00:22:17.404 --> 00:22:18.840 position:10% line:89% align:start
Can I get one just like it?

00:22:18.873 --> 00:22:22.043 position:10% line:83% align:start
[chuckles] Sorry, I'm afraid
this sucker's one of a kind.

00:22:22.076 --> 00:22:24.712 position:19% line:83% align:start
Got it when some damn
pirate cut off my arm.

00:22:24.745 --> 00:22:28.616 position:19% line:83% align:start
These crazy scientists
with the Navy cooked it up.

00:22:28.649 --> 00:22:30.151 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's called the
"Battle Smasher."

00:22:30.184 --> 00:22:32.053 position:24% line:83% align:start
The claw's made of
Sea Prism Stone,

00:22:32.086 --> 00:22:35.156 position:21% line:83% align:start
so I can neutralize
Devil Fruit users.

00:22:35.189 --> 00:22:39.927 position:10% line:83% align:start
The palm's got an explosive
charge to blow them to bits.

00:22:39.961 --> 00:22:41.929 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I don't recommend
such a heavy weapon

00:22:41.963 --> 00:22:45.166 position:27% line:83% align:start
for someone like
you, Dr. Chopper.

00:22:45.199 --> 00:22:47.735 position:10% line:83% align:start
Also, you can't take it off
without a special device,

00:22:47.768 --> 00:22:49.971 position:19% line:83% align:start
so it's a pain if you
fall in the sea.

00:22:50.004 --> 00:22:51.939 position:21% line:83% align:start
So are you with the
Navy or something?

00:22:51.973 --> 00:22:55.475 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Z] No. I was, but I
got too old and quit.

00:22:55.509 --> 00:22:57.511 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm doin' something
else these days.

00:22:57.545 --> 00:22:58.512 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Like what?

00:22:58.546 --> 00:23:00.181 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Z] Let's just say I'm
fighting for a mission

00:23:00.214 --> 00:23:02.415 position:21% line:89% align:start
I imposed on myself.

00:23:02.449 --> 00:23:04.185 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Fighting against who?

00:23:04.218 --> 00:23:07.487 position:13% line:89% align:start
Huh. Wow. Slow down, kid.

00:23:07.521 --> 00:23:09.422 position:21% line:83% align:start
It almost feels like
you're interrogating me.

00:23:09.456 --> 00:23:10.658 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, sorry.

00:23:10.691 --> 00:23:12.727 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's just, if it turned out
that you were with the Marines,

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.630 position:19% line:83% align:start
things could get ugly
for the both of us.

00:23:15.663 --> 00:23:18.766 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Z] Why would things be ugly
between you and the Marines?

00:23:18.799 --> 00:23:22.770 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, because we're
pirates, of course.

00:23:22.803 --> 00:23:24.205 position:44% line:83% align:start
[Z]
I see.

00:23:24.238 --> 00:23:27.041 position:13% line:89% align:start
Pirates. I shoulda known.

00:23:27.074 --> 00:23:28.643 position:35% line:89% align:start
[ALL yell]

00:23:30.945 --> 00:23:32.847 position:41% line:89% align:start
Luffy!

00:23:35.082 --> 00:23:36.483 position:24% line:89% align:start
Nami, get outside!

00:23:36.517 --> 00:23:37.852 position:24% line:89% align:start
Give it your best!

00:23:37.885 --> 00:23:40.755 position:19% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY] That Sea Prism
Stone hurts like hell!

00:23:40.788 --> 00:23:42.690 position:44% line:83% align:start
[Z]
Stand up.

00:23:42.723 --> 00:23:44.959 position:16% line:83% align:start
Before I eliminate you,
look me in the eye

00:23:44.992 --> 00:23:48.495 position:21% line:83% align:start
and tell me why you
became a criminal.

00:23:50.665 --> 00:23:53.768 position:16% line:83% align:start
'Cause I'm gonna be King
of the Pirates, that's why.

00:23:56.137 --> 00:23:59.040 position:44% line:83% align:start
[Z]
King of the Pirates.

00:23:59.073 --> 00:24:01.676 position:13% line:89% align:start
Don't make me laugh, boy!

00:24:04.612 --> 00:24:05.846 position:38% line:89% align:start
[yells]

00:24:15.156 --> 00:24:17.258 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, man! He's strong!

00:24:17.291 --> 00:24:18.526 position:30% line:89% align:start
[SANJI groans]

00:24:21.896 --> 00:24:23.631 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Z yells]

00:24:23.664 --> 00:24:25.633 position:38% line:89% align:start
Damn it!

00:24:25.666 --> 00:24:27.635 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey, Brook. Let's try
to back 'em up!

00:24:27.668 --> 00:24:29.770 position:38% line:83% align:start
[BROOK]
Of course.

00:24:29.804 --> 00:24:31.906 position:38% line:89% align:start
[yells]

00:24:31.939 --> 00:24:33.908 position:35% line:89% align:start
[yelping]

00:24:36.577 --> 00:24:38.579 position:21% line:89% align:start
Guess they made it.

00:24:41.215 --> 00:24:42.216 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
Uh?

00:24:43.784 --> 00:24:47.221 position:5% line:83% align:start
I am Ain. I am the vice-admiral
of the New Marines.

00:24:47.254 --> 00:24:50.057 position:13% line:83% align:start
As you can see, our fleet
has surrounded your ship.

00:24:50.091 --> 00:24:51.058 position:30% line:89% align:start
Do not resist.

00:24:51.092 --> 00:24:54.195 position:16% line:83% align:start
Attempting to do so will
only invite your death.

00:24:55.696 --> 00:24:58.899 position:16% line:83% align:start
Ow, ow! Don't you idiots
know we're pirates?

00:24:58.933 --> 00:25:01.902 position:13% line:83% align:start
You say "don't resist" and
all we wanna do is fight!

00:25:01.936 --> 00:25:03.671 position:38% line:89% align:start
[yells]

00:25:03.704 --> 00:25:05.673 position:24% line:83% align:start
Great, this guy's
got a whole crew?

00:25:05.706 --> 00:25:08.042 position:30% line:89% align:start
[FRANKY yells]

00:25:10.911 --> 00:25:12.079 position:38% line:83% align:start
[FRANKY]
Huh?

00:25:12.113 --> 00:25:16.817 position:7% line:89% align:start
Mosa, Mosa. Grow, grow, grow!

00:25:20.688 --> 00:25:22.323 position:30% line:89% align:start
Stupid grass!

I know what Zed wants to do.

He wants to wipe out all the
pirates in the New World.

And if he can destroy

he might damn well pull it off.

00:33:09.089 --> 00:33:11.024 position:10% line:89% align:start
It seems like you know him.

00:33:12.059 --> 00:33:13.561 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's right, I do.

00:33:13.595 --> 00:33:18.232 position:5% line:89% align:start
Zed was an old comrade of mine.

00:33:18.265 --> 00:33:21.368 position:5% line:89% align:start
A Marine, just like all of you.

00:33:21.401 --> 00:33:22.804 position:10% line:89% align:start
You were my friend, Zephyr.

00:33:22.837 --> 00:33:25.707 position:19% line:83% align:start
This is the last thing
I would ever want.

00:33:28.141 --> 00:33:30.110 position:19% line:89% align:start
Is this your revenge?

00:33:30.143 --> 00:33:34.047 position:5% line:83% align:start
A grudge so deep you're willing
to destroy the world?

00:33:36.784 --> 00:33:38.520 position:16% line:83% align:start
[GARP] Is that the price
you're going to pay

00:33:38.553 --> 00:33:40.688 position:16% line:89% align:start
just to get back at us?

00:34:00.474 --> 00:34:03.645 position:19% line:83% align:start
Luffy, don't sweat it!
I got this!

00:34:03.678 --> 00:34:06.313 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nothin' wrong with
the Sunny I can't fix!

00:34:06.346 --> 00:34:07.749 position:13% line:89% align:start
Might take a little while,

00:34:07.782 --> 00:34:11.084 position:13% line:83% align:start
but you're goin' after Zed
in the meantime, right, bro?

00:34:11.118 --> 00:34:14.756 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's right. I gotta
settle the score.

00:34:14.789 --> 00:34:17.424 position:7% line:83% align:start
This should cover the docking
fee while we're doing repairs.

00:34:17.457 --> 00:34:18.693 position:16% line:89% align:start
And this is for lodging.

00:34:18.726 --> 00:34:20.795 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, you guys.

00:34:20.828 --> 00:34:23.196 position:21% line:83% align:start
If I hadn't insisted
on helping out Zed,

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:24.464 position:5% line:89% align:start
none of this would've happened.

00:34:24.498 --> 00:34:26.701 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ZORO]
I don't wanna hear that talk.

00:34:26.734 --> 00:34:28.201 position:13% line:89% align:start
As a pirate and a doctor,

00:34:28.235 --> 00:34:30.170 position:16% line:83% align:start
you should never regret
doing what you believe in,

00:34:30.203 --> 00:34:31.773 position:10% line:89% align:start
no matter how it turns out.

00:34:31.806 --> 00:34:33.340 position:27% line:83% align:start
We trust you as
a part of our crew

00:34:33.373 --> 00:34:35.777 position:10% line:89% align:start
and stand by your decision.

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:37.745 position:13% line:89% align:start
Thanks, that means a lot.

00:34:37.779 --> 00:34:39.246 position:44% line:89% align:start
Heh.

00:34:39.279 --> 00:34:41.248 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
Who is this Zed guy anyway?

00:34:41.281 --> 00:34:42.750 position:19% line:89% align:start
And "The Neo Marines"?

00:34:42.784 --> 00:34:44.018 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CHOPPER]
He seemed nice at first,

00:34:44.052 --> 00:34:46.888 position:7% line:83% align:start
but he went totally nuts when
he found out we were pirates.

00:34:46.921 --> 00:34:48.121 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
Tch.

00:34:48.155 --> 00:34:51.291 position:7% line:83% align:start
And that plant guy he had with
him was a pain in the ass.

00:34:51.325 --> 00:34:54.461 position:10% line:83% align:start
He just took us by surprise
last time, that's all.

00:34:54.494 --> 00:34:56.731 position:19% line:83% align:start
And besides, we gotta
avenge the Sunny,

00:34:56.764 --> 00:34:58.900 position:16% line:83% align:start
since she's the one that
got us outta that mess.

00:34:58.933 --> 00:35:01.536 position:10% line:83% align:start
[NAMI] No kidding. We really
dropped the ball back there.

00:35:01.569 --> 00:35:02.737 position:21% line:83% align:start
If she hadn't pulled
through for us,

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:05.506 position:13% line:83% align:start
we'd all be sitting on the
bottom of the ocean right now.

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:08.141 position:10% line:83% align:start
[ROBIN] The first step is to
hunt down these Neo Marines.

00:35:08.175 --> 00:35:09.611 position:30% line:83% align:start
Then we'll pay
them back properly.

00:35:09.644 --> 00:35:10.845 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
You mean right now?

00:35:10.878 --> 00:35:12.680 position:19% line:83% align:start
You saw how dangerous
those guys were.

00:35:12.714 --> 00:35:14.649 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm in no rush to
fight them again!

00:35:14.682 --> 00:35:17.150 position:24% line:83% align:start
Let's lay low here
till the Sunny's fixed.

00:35:17.184 --> 00:35:18.385 position:16% line:89% align:start
Maybe we'll get over it.

00:35:18.418 --> 00:35:21.488 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's easy for you to say!
You realize I'm stuck like this.

00:35:21.522 --> 00:35:24.659 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you're waiting for me to "get
over it," it'll take 12 years!

00:35:24.692 --> 00:35:29.296 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah, me, too! I don't
wanna be stuck like this!

00:35:29.329 --> 00:35:30.798 position:24% line:83% align:start
[NAMI] How do you
expect me to do my job

00:35:30.832 --> 00:35:32.499 position:10% line:89% align:start
with this tiny little body?

00:35:32.533 --> 00:35:36.203 position:13% line:83% align:start
Surviving in the New World
is tough enough as is!

00:35:36.236 --> 00:35:37.170 position:16% line:89% align:start
I have to be in top form

00:35:37.204 --> 00:35:39.674 position:16% line:83% align:start
as our ship's navigator
and protect myself,

00:35:39.707 --> 00:35:42.309 position:19% line:83% align:start
and to do that, I need
my old body back!

00:35:42.342 --> 00:35:43.945 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, Usopp!

00:35:43.978 --> 00:35:46.413 position:13% line:83% align:start
I just meant we shouldn't
rush into things, y'know?

00:35:46.446 --> 00:35:48.181 position:5% line:89% align:start
Give you guys some time to rest!

00:35:48.215 --> 00:35:50.818 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't wanna be stuck like
this either. It's annoying.

00:35:50.852 --> 00:35:51.653 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
Right.

00:35:51.686 --> 00:35:53.688 position:21% line:83% align:start
I know you're happy
to be 18 again,

00:35:53.721 --> 00:35:56.256 position:7% line:83% align:start
with everything soft and cute
and right where it belongs!

00:35:56.289 --> 00:35:58.258 position:27% line:89% align:start
[USOPP yelling]

00:35:58.291 --> 00:36:00.494 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
I'm sorry!

00:36:00.528 --> 00:36:02.462 position:24% line:83% align:start
The ladies are in
trouble, you damn fool,

00:36:02.496 --> 00:36:05.867 position:7% line:83% align:start
so how 'bout you show a little
common decency for once?

00:36:08.503 --> 00:36:09.436 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:36:09.469 --> 00:36:10.805 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
But wait a second.

00:36:10.838 --> 00:36:12.205 position:16% line:89% align:start
If they don't get fixed,

00:36:12.239 --> 00:36:13.975 position:19% line:83% align:start
that means I'll get to
watch Nami transform

00:36:14.008 --> 00:36:16.611 position:10% line:83% align:start
from this little caterpillar
into the beautiful butterfly

00:36:16.644 --> 00:36:19.379 position:27% line:89% align:start
I know and love!

00:36:19.413 --> 00:36:22.449 position:21% line:83% align:start
Each fleeting moment
more lovely than the last!

00:36:26.587 --> 00:36:27.655 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't be weird.

00:36:27.689 --> 00:36:29.791 position:21% line:83% align:start
My love is perfectly
innocent, okay?

00:36:29.824 --> 00:36:32.392 position:16% line:83% align:start
And by the way, if you'd
been turned into a kid,

00:36:32.426 --> 00:36:34.696 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'd just step on your
ugly green head.

00:36:34.729 --> 00:36:35.763 position:19% line:89% align:start
What are you, stupid?

00:36:35.797 --> 00:36:38.432 position:21% line:83% align:start
Even if I was a kid,
I could still kick your ass!

00:36:38.465 --> 00:36:39.701 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, you would, would you?

00:36:39.734 --> 00:36:41.602 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, then I'd just have
to be a three year old

00:36:41.636 --> 00:36:43.571 position:21% line:83% align:start
and kick your sorry
ass even harder!

00:36:43.604 --> 00:36:44.404 position:33% line:89% align:start
How's that?

00:36:44.438 --> 00:36:45.640 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah?!

00:36:45.673 --> 00:36:48.009 position:10% line:83% align:start
Then I'd just have to stomp
your ass as a little bitty baby!

00:36:48.042 --> 00:36:49.877 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah? Then I would
just have to--

00:36:49.911 --> 00:36:51.079 position:33% line:89% align:start
[BOTH growl]

00:36:51.112 --> 00:36:55.550 position:7% line:83% align:start
[NAMI] Now is not the time for
this--not that it ever is!

00:36:55.583 --> 00:36:58.019 position:13% line:83% align:start
[BROOK] Actually, perhaps
you didn't notice,

00:36:58.052 --> 00:37:01.455 position:13% line:83% align:start
but I was transformed into
a younger age as well.

00:37:01.488 --> 00:37:02.623 position:30% line:89% align:start
Are you sure?

00:37:02.657 --> 00:37:03.658 position:16% line:89% align:start
You look the same to me.

00:37:03.691 --> 00:37:04.726 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah, what's different?

00:37:04.759 --> 00:37:07.028 position:10% line:83% align:start
[BROOK] If you will recall,
Miss Ain touched me

00:37:07.061 --> 00:37:08.963 position:24% line:83% align:start
when I was trapped
by the plants.

00:37:08.996 --> 00:37:11.431 position:21% line:83% align:start
[USOPP] Now that you
mentioned it, she did, huh?

00:37:11.465 --> 00:37:13.034 position:13% line:89% align:start
Not that it changed much.

00:37:13.067 --> 00:37:16.504 position:16% line:83% align:start
On the contrary, despite
being dead and bones,

00:37:16.537 --> 00:37:20.340 position:5% line:83% align:start
and despite being in this state
for more than 50 years now,

00:37:20.373 --> 00:37:23.343 position:21% line:83% align:start
this is a remarkable
change indeed.

00:37:23.376 --> 00:37:26.948 position:19% line:83% align:start
Twelve years younger,
it's a miracle. Look!

00:37:26.981 --> 00:37:29.751 position:7% line:83% align:start
My hair has the luster it had
when I was merely 70!

00:37:29.784 --> 00:37:31.351 position:13% line:89% align:start
Would ya like to touch it?

00:37:31.384 --> 00:37:32.419 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
It looks the same!

00:37:32.452 --> 00:37:35.056 position:13% line:83% align:start
How can we tell since you
dye your hair, anyway?

00:37:35.089 --> 00:37:36.157 position:16% line:89% align:start
So even though we lost,

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:38.993 position:13% line:83% align:start
you're still happy she hit
you with that attack?

00:37:39.026 --> 00:37:41.328 position:21% line:83% align:start
And even if we win,
you wanna stay that way?

00:37:41.361 --> 00:37:44.665 position:7% line:83% align:start
Huh. When you put it that way,
I suppose it's true.

00:37:44.699 --> 00:37:47.869 position:10% line:83% align:start
Wait, that's no good. I want
my true age and body back.

00:37:47.902 --> 00:37:48.468 position:38% line:89% align:start
Don't I?

00:37:48.503 --> 00:37:50.638 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
Don't ask me!

00:37:50.671 --> 00:37:52.439 position:38% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:37:52.472 --> 00:37:54.642 position:21% line:83% align:start
If we wanna get back
to our normal ages,

00:37:54.675 --> 00:37:57.078 position:16% line:83% align:start
I guess all we can do is
try to gather some info

00:37:57.111 --> 00:37:59.580 position:27% line:89% align:start
on this Zed guy.

00:37:59.614 --> 00:38:02.817 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ow! Hey, old man, do
you need somethin'?

00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:04.786 position:19% line:83% align:start
If it's about the fee
for using your dock,

00:38:04.819 --> 00:38:06.721 position:27% line:83% align:start
talk to our cute
little navigator.

00:38:06.754 --> 00:38:10.357 position:24% line:83% align:start
Zed strikes again.
No surprise there.

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:12.794 position:16% line:83% align:start
Wait a second, you know
somethin' about Zed?

00:38:12.827 --> 00:38:14.394 position:35% line:83% align:start
[MOBSTON]
Let me put it this way.

00:38:14.427 --> 00:38:16.097 position:27% line:83% align:start
Your pirate ship
isn't the only one

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:19.700 position:5% line:83% align:start
to have washed up on this dock,
all battered and busted up.

00:38:19.734 --> 00:38:22.036 position:19% line:83% align:start
Happened a lot lately,
and all the pirates,

00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:24.572 position:19% line:83% align:start
with their black eyes
and broken bones,

00:38:24.605 --> 00:38:26.473 position:30% line:83% align:start
say it was Zed
that did it to 'em.

00:38:26.507 --> 00:38:28.441 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:38:28.475 --> 00:38:30.011 position:19% line:83% align:start
You'll have to excuse
my grandfather,

00:38:30.044 --> 00:38:32.013 position:21% line:83% align:start
this is all he talks
about these days.

00:38:32.046 --> 00:38:35.448 position:10% line:83% align:start
Every customer we have it's
just, "Zed and the pirates."

00:38:35.482 --> 00:38:38.119 position:24% line:83% align:start
We've been on this
island for a long time--

00:38:38.152 --> 00:38:40.621 position:27% line:83% align:start
repairing ships,
renting out the dockyard,

00:38:40.655 --> 00:38:41.856 position:13% line:89% align:start
and taking care of pirates

00:38:41.889 --> 00:38:44.491 position:24% line:83% align:start
who have had nasty
run-ins with Marines.

00:38:44.525 --> 00:38:46.493 position:21% line:83% align:start
Grandfather used to
be a sailor, too,

00:38:46.527 --> 00:38:48.461 position:27% line:83% align:start
so he treats all
customers equally,

00:38:48.495 --> 00:38:50.898 position:19% line:83% align:start
even if they might be
wanted by the government.

00:38:50.932 --> 00:38:53.568 position:10% line:83% align:start
There's somethin' beautiful
about coming to the New World

00:38:53.601 --> 00:38:55.703 position:19% line:83% align:start
and risking your life
and following your dream

00:38:55.736 --> 00:38:56.971 position:21% line:89% align:start
no matter the cost.

00:38:57.004 --> 00:38:58.606 position:27% line:89% align:start
What can I say?

00:38:58.639 --> 00:39:00.473 position:10% line:89% align:start
These men are brave as hell,

00:39:00.508 --> 00:39:03.144 position:5% line:83% align:start
but once Zed gets a hold of 'em,
their spirits are broken

00:39:03.177 --> 00:39:04.879 position:21% line:83% align:start
and they don't wanna
fight anymore.

00:39:04.912 --> 00:39:07.515 position:7% line:89% align:start
Their dreams come here to die.

00:39:07.548 --> 00:39:10.985 position:7% line:83% align:start
So it's a crime to help these
men, but I stand by them.

00:39:11.018 --> 00:39:13.588 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wanna pick them up
as best I can,

00:39:13.621 --> 00:39:15.422 position:24% line:83% align:start
because what Zed's
stolen from them's

00:39:15.455 --> 00:39:18.092 position:10% line:89% align:start
as precious as life itself.

00:39:18.125 --> 00:39:19.492 position:7% line:89% align:start
But you fellas are different.

00:39:19.527 --> 00:39:20.761 position:19% line:89% align:start
You got beaten by Zed,

00:39:20.795 --> 00:39:22.997 position:16% line:83% align:start
but you still wanna pick
yourselves up and fight.

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:25.498 position:19% line:83% align:start
So I'm gonna give you
the powerful weapons

00:39:25.533 --> 00:39:27.802 position:21% line:83% align:start
that the men before
you left behind, see?

00:39:27.835 --> 00:39:29.537 position:19% line:89% align:start
Powerful weapons, huh?

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:31.005 position:5% line:89% align:start
That sounds awesome! Lemme see!

00:39:31.038 --> 00:39:32.472 position:30% line:89% align:start
[USOPP laughs]

00:39:32.506 --> 00:39:33.674 position:7% line:89% align:start
Don't get ahead of yourselves.

00:39:33.708 --> 00:39:35.042 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah, but they're powerful!

00:39:35.076 --> 00:39:36.611 position:21% line:83% align:start
I mean, what else do
we need to know?

00:39:36.644 --> 00:39:38.112 position:13% line:89% align:start
If we can't even find Zed,

00:39:38.145 --> 00:39:40.447 position:24% line:83% align:start
"powerful" doesn't
do us much good.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.617 position:24% line:83% align:start
But we need to buy
some new clothes.

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:44.051 position:24% line:83% align:start
Not because I want
to go shopping--

00:39:44.085 --> 00:39:46.187 position:5% line:89% align:start
because Zed burned all of them.

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:49.523 position:5% line:83% align:start
If we try to gather information
wearing party costumes,

00:39:49.557 --> 00:39:52.593 position:10% line:83% align:start
we'll be laughed outta town
before we learn anything.

00:39:52.627 --> 00:39:55.096 position:24% line:83% align:start
So first clothes,
then information, okay?

00:39:55.129 --> 00:39:57.598 position:19% line:83% align:start
Then powerful weapons,
then we fight Zed!

00:39:57.632 --> 00:39:58.532 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's the rule!

00:39:58.566 --> 00:40:00.534 position:21% line:89% align:start
Uh. All right, sure.

00:40:00.568 --> 00:40:01.434 position:27% line:83% align:start
[GRANDDAUGHTER]
Wow, Nami,

00:40:01.468 --> 00:40:03.137 position:21% line:83% align:start
you sure are mature
for a little girl.

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:04.272 position:27% line:89% align:start
[NAMI chuckles]

00:40:04.305 --> 00:40:06.674 position:19% line:83% align:start
[NAMI] Oh, by the way,
is there a town on this island

00:40:06.707 --> 00:40:08.209 position:21% line:83% align:start
where we could find
what we're looking for?

00:40:08.242 --> 00:40:10.211 position:21% line:83% align:start
A place with lots of
people and shops?

00:40:10.244 --> 00:40:12.013 position:7% line:83% align:start
[GRANDDAUGHTER] Unfortunately,
we're the main attraction

00:40:12.046 --> 00:40:14.849 position:13% line:83% align:start
on this island, or rather,
the only attraction.

00:40:14.882 --> 00:40:16.217 position:24% line:83% align:start
The island next to
ours should have

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:18.219 position:5% line:89% align:start
what you're looking for, though.

00:40:18.252 --> 00:40:21.656 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's really popular for its hot
springs and volcano tours.

00:40:21.689 --> 00:40:23.824 position:21% line:83% align:start
A Sea Train started
going there recently,

00:40:23.858 --> 00:40:25.893 position:5% line:89% align:start
so it's brimming with tourists.

00:40:25.927 --> 00:40:28.095 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
You mean <i>the</i> Sea Train?

00:40:28.129 --> 00:40:29.563 position:41% line:89% align:start
I do!

00:40:32.767 --> 00:40:38.572 position:27% line:89% align:start
[whistle blows]

00:40:41.208 --> 00:40:43.077 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
Oooh!

00:40:51.018 --> 00:40:53.521 position:35% line:89% align:start
[humming]

00:40:53.554 --> 00:40:54.722 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:40:54.755 --> 00:40:55.990 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
Yeah, Mosshead, our captain,

00:40:56.023 --> 00:40:58.893 position:7% line:83% align:start
and the skeleton with the afro
might be a bit conspicuous,

00:40:58.926 --> 00:41:01.696 position:13% line:83% align:start
but since they still can't
get my wanted poster right,

00:41:01.729 --> 00:41:03.097 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll go with the ladies.

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:05.800 position:7% line:89% align:start
Right, Nami-swan? Robin-dear?

00:41:05.833 --> 00:41:07.268 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
You can't come either, Sanji.

00:41:07.301 --> 00:41:08.436 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
What?!

00:41:08.468 --> 00:41:11.806 position:13% line:83% align:start
[NAMI] No one conspicuous
and no one who picks fights.

00:41:11.839 --> 00:41:14.275 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're just here to
gather information.

00:41:14.308 --> 00:41:19.213 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
But it's a resort. And ladies...

00:41:19.246 --> 00:41:22.283 position:7% line:83% align:start
[ZORO] We violent, conspicuous
types can hit up the hot springs

00:41:22.316 --> 00:41:23.551 position:19% line:89% align:start
before our big fight.

00:41:23.584 --> 00:41:24.484 position:38% line:83% align:start
[BROOK]
Splendid!

00:41:24.518 --> 00:41:26.754 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, and let me pick
out our new clothes!

00:41:26.787 --> 00:41:29.290 position:7% line:83% align:start
I hear they have some fabulous
boutiques on the island,

00:41:29.323 --> 00:41:32.960 position:13% line:83% align:start
so I'm eager to see what's
in fashion this season!

00:41:32.994 --> 00:41:34.028 position:41% line:83% align:start
[NAMI]
Well, this is it.

00:41:34.061 --> 00:41:37.164 position:13% line:83% align:start
Whatever you do, don't get
caught by the Marines.

00:41:37.198 --> 00:41:39.133 position:24% line:83% align:start
We'll split up now
and meet up later!

00:41:39.166 --> 00:41:40.201 position:38% line:83% align:start
[OTHERS]
Yes, ma'am!

00:41:40.234 --> 00:41:42.737 position:13% line:83% align:start
--[ROBIN] This way, then.
--[BROOK] And off we go!

00:41:44.839 --> 00:41:46.807 position:35% line:89% align:start
[groaning]

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:51.312 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
Ridiculous.

00:41:51.345 --> 00:41:54.982 position:10% line:83% align:start
You Devil Fruit users can't
even handle a little bath?

00:41:55.016 --> 00:41:57.284 position:21% line:83% align:start
Makes me wonder why
you even bothered.

00:41:59.353 --> 00:42:02.823 position:7% line:83% align:start
If it's only our bottom half,
the sensation's almost pleasant.

00:42:02.857 --> 00:42:05.659 position:24% line:89% align:start
[sighs] I love it!

00:42:05.693 --> 00:42:08.562 position:19% line:83% align:start
How many days have we
spent here, by the way?

00:42:08.596 --> 00:42:12.333 position:16% line:83% align:start
Surely there's something
more effective we can do.

00:42:12.366 --> 00:42:15.836 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, yeah, we gotta beat up Zed!
Let's go fight him right now!

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:17.038 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SANJI]
Yeah, where?

00:42:17.071 --> 00:42:19.206 position:24% line:83% align:start
Did you forget why
we're hangin' out here?

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:20.875 position:19% line:83% align:start
The island's swarming
with Marines

00:42:20.908 --> 00:42:23.110 position:21% line:83% align:start
and we haven't found
any info yet.

00:42:24.945 --> 00:42:27.848 position:19% line:89% align:start
This is all we can do.

00:42:27.882 --> 00:42:30.051 position:7% line:89% align:start
We gotta trust in Nami's plan.

00:42:30.084 --> 00:42:32.353 position:7% line:83% align:start
The ladies, Chopper, and Usopp
are getting answers.

00:42:32.386 --> 00:42:34.688 position:16% line:83% align:start
We just gotta be patient
till they find them.

00:42:34.722 --> 00:42:39.727 position:30% line:89% align:start
[MEN cheering]

00:42:50.071 --> 00:42:52.206 position:13% line:89% align:start
I like it! She's talented.

00:42:52.239 --> 00:42:54.809 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're right! And my
patrons love her!

00:42:54.842 --> 00:42:56.377 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, sir, I hope
this is the start

00:42:56.410 --> 00:42:58.145 position:5% line:89% align:start
of a very lucrative friendship!

00:42:58.179 --> 00:43:01.048 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:43:01.082 --> 00:43:03.384 position:21% line:83% align:start
You goin' on a date,
mister? Best of luck!

00:43:03.417 --> 00:43:04.785 position:35% line:83% align:start
[CUSTOMER]
Thanks a lot, kid.

00:43:04.819 --> 00:43:06.887 position:10% line:89% align:start
But I hope I don't need it.

00:43:06.921 --> 00:43:11.792 position:10% line:83% align:start
Ah. A cliché? Yes, but I've
been soaked to the bone.

00:43:11.826 --> 00:43:15.262 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's like the stress has melted
away, along with my skin.

00:43:15.296 --> 00:43:17.064 position:30% line:89% align:start
Damn it, Zed.

00:43:17.098 --> 00:43:19.233 position:5% line:83% align:start
When I saw that awesome-looking
arm thing of yours,

00:43:19.266 --> 00:43:21.268 position:21% line:89% align:start
I let my guard down.

00:43:21.302 --> 00:43:22.937 position:10% line:89% align:start
But that won't happen again.

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:25.239 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're gonna need to
cook up some kind of plan.

00:43:25.272 --> 00:43:27.842 position:19% line:83% align:start
Devil Fruit powers put
you at a disadvantage.

00:43:27.875 --> 00:43:30.411 position:7% line:83% align:start
The first thing he's gonna do
is grab you with that big arm

00:43:30.444 --> 00:43:32.913 position:21% line:83% align:start
and you'll lose your
power like last time.

00:43:32.947 --> 00:43:34.315 position:24% line:83% align:start
Better off lettin'
me or Mosshead

00:43:34.348 --> 00:43:36.684 position:16% line:83% align:start
take care of the bastard
from now on.

00:43:36.717 --> 00:43:39.086 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Sorry, but not a chance.

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.889 position:7% line:89% align:start
I gotta be the one to do this.

00:43:41.922 --> 00:43:43.791 position:13% line:89% align:start
If I can't avoid his arm,

00:43:43.824 --> 00:43:46.127 position:21% line:83% align:start
then I've just gotta
smash right through it.

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.063 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AOKIJI] You've got just
as much energy as ever.

00:43:49.096 --> 00:43:51.232 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've been soakin' a
while waitin' for ya,

00:43:51.265 --> 00:43:53.834 position:13% line:89% align:start
so I'm a bit lightheaded.

Aokiji?

00:44:03.177 --> 00:44:06.347 position:13% line:83% align:start
That was a rather extreme
reaction, wouldn't you say?

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:08.149 position:30% line:83% align:start
Is this man an
acquaintance of yours?

00:44:08.182 --> 00:44:10.084 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah, he's a Marine.

00:44:10.117 --> 00:44:12.386 position:24% line:83% align:start
Admiral Aokiji of
Navy Headquarters.

[BROOK]
Admiral?!

00:44:14.321 --> 00:44:17.925 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey. It's been quite
a while, huh?

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:25.099 position:7% line:89% align:start
Master, the work here is done.

00:44:25.132 --> 00:44:27.268 position:19% line:83% align:start
All of the Dyna Stones
have been set.

[Z]
I see.

00:44:32.239 --> 00:44:36.744 position:19% line:83% align:start
We'll have the volcano
erupt, just as planned.

00:44:36.777 --> 00:44:39.480 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then those weak Marines
will finally understand.

00:44:39.514 --> 00:44:41.949 position:7% line:89% align:start
This is the cost of my wrath.

00:44:41.982 --> 00:44:45.352 position:13% line:83% align:start
This is the fate they have
brought upon themselves.

00:44:47.021 --> 00:44:48.289 position:16% line:89% align:start
You ready to back me up?

Does the man make the dream,
or the dream make the man?

00:50:44.879 --> 00:50:46.548 position:5% line:89% align:start
When pirates chase their dreams,

00:50:46.581 --> 00:50:49.584 position:10% line:83% align:start
sometimes they step on other
people's dreams in the process,

00:50:49.617 --> 00:50:53.788 position:24% line:83% align:start
and sometimes they
destroy people's lives.

00:50:53.821 --> 00:50:57.224 position:16% line:83% align:start
Does that mean we should
crush their dream in return?

00:50:57.257 --> 00:50:59.459 position:19% line:89% align:start
Is that even possible?

00:50:59.493 --> 00:51:04.632 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now former Marine Admiral Zed is
tryin' to answer that question.

00:51:04.666 --> 00:51:09.336 position:5% line:83% align:start
"If One Piece were to disappear,
so would all the pirates."

00:51:09.369 --> 00:51:12.774 position:21% line:83% align:start
A crude conclusion,
but that's what he thinks.

00:51:12.807 --> 00:51:15.677 position:24% line:83% align:start
I may no longer be
a Marine, myself,

00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:20.147 position:13% line:83% align:start
but still I wanna see what
fate has in store for Zed.

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:24.519 position:5% line:83% align:start
And as for what I do with myself
after that, can't say.

00:51:28.355 --> 00:51:30.223 position:38% line:83% align:start

But I'm glad I met you here,

00:51:30.257 --> 00:51:32.894 position:10% line:83% align:start
because I know you're gonna
follow your dreams to the end,

00:51:32.927 --> 00:51:35.797 position:16% line:83% align:start
even if it means butting
heads with Zed again.

00:51:35.830 --> 00:51:39.901 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've seen his answer and
now I wanna see yours.

00:51:39.934 --> 00:51:44.806 position:13% line:83% align:start
So long. You can find Zed
on this island, by the way.

00:51:49.877 --> 00:51:52.212 position:16% line:83% align:start
We go to so much trouble
to disguise ourselves

00:51:52.245 --> 00:51:54.147 position:21% line:83% align:start
and all hell breaks
loose anyway?

We got our info,
that's good enough for me!

what he's up to,

figure out where Zed's hiding,

00:52:55.009 --> 00:52:58.378 position:21% line:83% align:start

At the sand dunes.

00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:29.770 position:5% line:89% align:start
But make no mistake, swordsman,

00:59:29.804 --> 00:59:32.840 position:24% line:83% align:start
if we meet again,
you will meet your end!

00:59:34.408 --> 00:59:35.810 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mosa!

[groans]

00:59:41.849 --> 00:59:44.385 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's time to depart.

00:59:44.418 --> 00:59:46.620 position:24% line:89% align:start
Farewell, pirate!

00:59:50.324 --> 00:59:52.760 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well, I guess that's it, then.

00:59:56.430 --> 00:59:59.200 position:10% line:89% align:start
You annoying little coward.

[Z yells]

01:00:06.807 --> 01:00:09.243 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you don't overcome
your fear of my Smasher,

01:00:09.276 --> 01:00:11.178 position:5% line:89% align:start
you'll never land a blow on me.

01:00:11.212 --> 01:00:13.347 position:16% line:89% align:start
You do know that, right?

01:00:14.348 --> 01:00:16.984 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm not afraid of anything!

01:00:17.017 --> 01:00:19.653 position:21% line:83% align:start
Fear and uncertainly
dull your conviction.

01:00:19.687 --> 01:00:21.021 position:21% line:89% align:start
They make you weak!

01:00:21.055 --> 01:00:24.125 position:30% line:89% align:start
Smash Tornado!

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:28.095 position:27% line:89% align:start
[USOPP screams]

01:00:29.897 --> 01:00:30.998 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ah!

01:00:37.271 --> 01:00:40.841 position:19% line:83% align:start
Sorry, but I'm rubber,
so bullets don't work on me!

01:00:40.875 --> 01:00:43.110 position:38% line:89% align:start
[yells]

01:00:43.144 --> 01:00:45.179 position:38% line:89% align:start
That so?

[groaning]

01:00:49.917 --> 01:00:51.185 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
My power.

01:00:51.218 --> 01:00:53.254 position:44% line:83% align:start
[Z]
Don't bother trying to move.

01:00:53.287 --> 01:00:57.191 position:21% line:83% align:start
That bullet is made
from Sea Prism Stone.

01:00:57.224 --> 01:01:00.094 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's a difficult
material to process,

01:01:00.127 --> 01:01:03.998 position:13% line:83% align:start
so you don't see something
like that every day.

01:01:04.031 --> 01:01:06.734 position:19% line:83% align:start
The pirates in the New
World were smart enough

01:01:06.767 --> 01:01:10.404 position:21% line:83% align:start
to see this coming,
but it still has its uses.

01:01:10.437 --> 01:01:13.107 position:33% line:83% align:start
For example,
it's quite effective

01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:17.344 position:13% line:83% align:start
on snot-nosed Devil Fruit
users who get sloppy.

01:01:17.378 --> 01:01:21.715 position:21% line:83% align:start
Criminals cannot be
allowed to go unpunished.

01:01:21.749 --> 01:01:24.318 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

01:01:24.351 --> 01:01:28.856 position:10% line:83% align:start
You know, I think this straw
hat has seen enough fights.

01:01:28.889 --> 01:01:32.493 position:10% line:83% align:start
When I bring an end to this
so-called Great Pirate Era,

01:01:32.527 --> 01:01:36.130 position:19% line:83% align:start
I think I'll bury your
hat along with it.

01:01:38.432 --> 01:01:40.334 position:38% line:83% align:start
[LUFFY]
Give it back!

01:01:40.367 --> 01:01:41.502 position:16% line:89% align:start
Shanks gave that to me,

01:01:41.536 --> 01:01:43.737 position:24% line:83% align:start
and I told him I'd
take care of it!

01:01:43.771 --> 01:01:45.973 position:30% line:83% align:start
I promised I'd
return it one day!

01:01:46.006 --> 01:01:47.975 position:35% line:89% align:start
Come back!

01:01:48.008 --> 01:01:51.245 position:10% line:83% align:start
It was Red-Haired Shanks who
showed you how to be a pirate?

01:01:51.278 --> 01:01:54.048 position:13% line:89% align:start
Piling sin on top of sin.

01:01:54.081 --> 01:01:56.383 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll have to punish
him, too, won't I?

01:01:56.417 --> 01:01:58.018 position:30% line:89% align:start
Give it back!

01:02:00.187 --> 01:02:02.423 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Z] Don't worry, he and
all the other pirates

01:02:02.456 --> 01:02:04.058 position:19% line:89% align:start
will follow you soon.

01:02:04.091 --> 01:02:05.392 position:16% line:89% align:start
After the Grand Reboot,

01:02:05.426 --> 01:02:08.530 position:10% line:83% align:start
you can all take your filthy
dream to the grave.

01:02:08.563 --> 01:02:11.131 position:13% line:83% align:start
If the Four Emperors think
I'm below their notice,

01:02:11.165 --> 01:02:12.399 position:19% line:89% align:start
then it's their loss.

01:02:12.433 --> 01:02:16.103 position:16% line:83% align:start
Arrogant bastards won't
know what hit 'em.

01:02:16.136 --> 01:02:18.138 position:21% line:83% align:start
But they'll be dead
as hell all the same.

01:02:18.172 --> 01:02:22.943 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't you dare...

[growls]

01:02:34.589 --> 01:02:36.558 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's a landslide

01:02:36.591 --> 01:02:39.360 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're all screwed
if we don't move.

01:02:39.393 --> 01:02:41.895 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey, Usopp! Where the
hell did Luffy go?

01:02:41.929 --> 01:02:43.063 position:41% line:89% align:start

Luffy, where are you?!

01:02:47.034 --> 01:02:49.837 position:35% line:89% align:start
Uh! Luffy!

01:02:52.239 --> 01:02:54.908 position:13% line:83% align:start

thing we can do about that.

01:02:54.942 --> 01:02:56.544 position:38% line:83% align:start
[USOPP]
Come on, run!

01:03:02.249 --> 01:03:04.184 position:24% line:83% align:start
You know how fast
that stuff moves?

01:03:04.218 --> 01:03:07.921 position:30% line:83% align:start

60 miles an hour.

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:20.934 position:30% line:89% align:start
Faster, Usopp!

01:03:20.968 --> 01:03:24.606 position:13% line:83% align:start

Ah! It's just a banana!

01:03:24.639 --> 01:03:26.608 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hey, look ahead!
We're gonna crash!

01:03:26.641 --> 01:03:28.976 position:10% line:83% align:start
[USOPP] Banana's don't have
steering wheels either!

01:03:29.009 --> 01:03:31.378 position:16% line:83% align:start
Okay. Shift your weight

Damn. Now that's what
I call fireworks.

[AIN] Master, is Straw

[Z] Only the flames can
answer that question.

01:04:58.533 --> 01:05:01.335 position:24% line:83% align:start
Everything in this
world? One Piece?

01:05:01.368 --> 01:05:03.971 position:19% line:83% align:start
Imagine all the things
that have been sacrificed

01:05:04.004 --> 01:05:06.306 position:13% line:89% align:start
for such a foolish dream.

01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:09.711 position:21% line:83% align:start
How much sadness and
hate has it bred?

01:05:09.744 --> 01:05:12.413 position:27% line:83% align:start
If this is what
their "era" means,

01:05:12.446 --> 01:05:16.350 position:13% line:83% align:start
if this is what they call
"free will," "freedom,"

01:05:16.383 --> 01:05:19.486 position:24% line:83% align:start
I will crush these
things without remorse.

01:05:19.521 --> 01:05:23.658 position:19% line:83% align:start
They chose this dream,
so let them be buried with it.

01:05:23.691 --> 01:05:26.960 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let them reap the consequences.

01:05:26.994 --> 01:05:30.130 position:5% line:83% align:start
If only for a moment, I'll show
them the same suffering

01:05:30.164 --> 01:05:32.232 position:5% line:89% align:start
they've brought upon this world,

01:05:32.266 --> 01:05:37.137 position:10% line:83% align:start
and draw the curtain on this
accursed "Great Pirate Era."

01:05:41.341 --> 01:05:43.545 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SENGOKU] The man has suffered
through something unspeakable,

01:05:43.578 --> 01:05:45.446 position:7% line:89% align:start
of course he has my sympathy.

01:05:45.479 --> 01:05:48.315 position:19% line:83% align:start
But however justified
his revenge may seem,

01:05:48.348 --> 01:05:52.252 position:10% line:83% align:start
involving civilians in this
catastrophe is inexcusable.

01:05:52.286 --> 01:05:54.421 position:21% line:89% align:start
That is not justice.

01:05:54.455 --> 01:05:57.257 position:7% line:89% align:start
As cut and dry as ever, I see.

01:05:57.291 --> 01:06:00.227 position:10% line:83% align:start
You may be right, but those
are the words of a Marine,

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:02.229 position:35% line:89% align:start
not a man.

01:06:02.262 --> 01:06:05.199 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is that really how
you feel, Sengoku?

01:06:12.239 --> 01:06:14.676 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ah.

Yes, what is it, boy?

01:06:21.749 --> 01:06:23.685 position:13% line:89% align:start
What kind of a man was he?

01:06:24.686 --> 01:06:27.221 position:38% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

01:06:27.254 --> 01:06:29.724 position:13% line:83% align:start
[GARP] He believed in the
justice we Marines stand for

01:06:29.757 --> 01:06:32.059 position:27% line:83% align:start
more than anyone
I've ever met.

01:06:32.092 --> 01:06:34.127 position:16% line:83% align:start
[COBY] Then why would he
do something like this?

01:06:34.161 --> 01:06:36.631 position:19% line:83% align:start
It makes him no better
than a murderer.

01:06:36.664 --> 01:06:39.299 position:41% line:83% align:start
[GARP]
There was... an incident.

01:06:39.333 --> 01:06:41.636 position:41% line:83% align:start
[COBY]
What happened?

01:06:41.669 --> 01:06:44.238 position:41% line:83% align:start
[GARP]
Zephyr was an earnest man.

01:06:44.271 --> 01:06:46.173 position:30% line:83% align:start
No matter how
dangerous the battle,

01:06:46.206 --> 01:06:49.744 position:5% line:83% align:start
he was always on the frontlines
ahead of his subordinates.

01:06:49.777 --> 01:06:52.580 position:10% line:83% align:start
He risked his life fighting
our strongest adversaries

01:06:52.614 --> 01:06:55.349 position:24% line:83% align:start
without so much as
a second thought.

01:06:55.382 --> 01:06:58.520 position:13% line:83% align:start
He was promoted to admiral
at a very young age.

01:06:58.553 --> 01:07:00.254 position:16% line:89% align:start
He married, had a child,

01:07:00.287 --> 01:07:02.757 position:19% line:83% align:start
and did extraordinary
work as a Marine.

01:07:02.790 --> 01:07:05.760 position:10% line:83% align:start
Then one day, a pirate that
held a grudge against him

01:07:05.793 --> 01:07:08.730 position:21% line:89% align:start
murdered his family.

01:07:08.763 --> 01:07:10.665 position:27% line:83% align:start
Zephyr knew full
well the gravity

01:07:10.698 --> 01:07:13.166 position:24% line:83% align:start
of his position as
a Marine admiral,

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.168 position:27% line:83% align:start
so despite being
stricken with grief,

01:07:15.202 --> 01:07:17.237 position:21% line:83% align:start
he buried his hatred
deep in his heart

01:07:17.271 --> 01:07:19.674 position:21% line:83% align:start
and immersed himself
in his work.

01:07:19.707 --> 01:07:22.409 position:5% line:89% align:start
Years went by without incident.

01:07:22.442 --> 01:07:24.512 position:21% line:83% align:start
Zephyr retired from
the front lines

01:07:24.546 --> 01:07:27.180 position:24% line:83% align:start
and spent his days
training young Marines.

01:07:27.214 --> 01:07:30.083 position:13% line:83% align:start

The information was so dangerous

01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:26.560 position:13% line:5% align:start
the Government used every

If pirates caught

they could throw
the world into chaos.
