1
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,089
- How do you like this building?

2
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:25,358
Pretty fuckin' sweet
place, isn't it?

3
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,192
- [Sawa] Yeah.

4
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,745
- [Man] You're really a lucky
little girl, you know that?

5
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,313
Those ugly dogs in my fan club

6
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:49,949
don't even know
about this place.

7
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:53,486
I'm gonna do things to you that
they never even dreamed of.

8
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:58,825
- Disgusting, vulgar,
arrogant punk.

9
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:02,162
Touching sweet young
girls like that in public.

10
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,998
Just because you think
you're some big TV star,

11
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,766
you think you can do
anything you want.

12
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:09,002
Who do you think you
are bringing young girls

13
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,204
up to your apartment
to do who knows what?

14
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,105
Shame on you!

15
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:12,939
- Shut up!

16
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,610
So, how does it
feel being kicked

17
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,446
by an arrogant celebrity punk?

18
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:20,847
You old bitch!

19
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:26,352
Your stinking perfume makes
me utterly sick to my stomach!

20
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:28,788
You're the disgusting one,
you shriveled up cunt!

21
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:38,898
(gun firing)

22
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:40,567
Uh!

23
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:41,401
(gun firing)

24
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:46,372
Oh!

25
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,244
Ah!

26
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:52,645
Ah!

27
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,914
- Oh, where are my glasses?

28
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:57,517
I'm going to sue you for this.

29
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,686
My son is an excellent lawyer.

30
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:02,288
He eats punks like
you for lunch.

31
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:05,325
Let's see what kind of a
career you have in jail.

32
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,160
He'll put you away for life!

33
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:11,264
Oh, where are those glasses?

34
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:15,335
(gentle music)

35
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:22,175
(siren blaring)

36
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,376
(sultry music)

37
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,795
(camera clicking)

38
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,934
- Yeah, looks like we got
fragments from two bullets.

39
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,236
One in the chest,
one in the head.

40
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,071
Blood's been forced
through the skin.

41
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,777
Hmm, guy never
knew what hit him.

42
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,645
- Hey, Boss.
- Yeah?

43
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:33,713
- Take a look.

44
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,748
We're looking for a special gun.

45
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:38,818
The weapon that did this was
designed with exploding shells.

46
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,059
- Let me know what the lab
finds on those fragments.

47
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,994
The coroner's boy should
be here any minute.

48
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,395
- Didn't they tell you?

49
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,763
They're all in the hospital
with food poisoning.

50
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:53,166
- Yeah, right, those assholes.

51
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,335
Betcha you they
still get overtime.

52
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,236
So, what's her story anyway?

53
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:59,072
- Well, apparently
the whole ordeal

54
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,740
must have sent her into shock.

55
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,810
My guess is the old broad
had a massive heart attack.

56
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,046
- Maybe, but we'd better get
an autopsy to cover our ass.

57
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,949
So, who the hell is this clown?

58
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,851
Some kind of movie star?

59
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,386
- He calls himself a comedian.

60
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,988
Some people seem
to like him though.

61
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,590
He's on the tube
seven days a week.

62
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,926
Ironically enough, the
guy told a whole lot

63
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,027
of dead body jokes.

64
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,261
Go figure.

65
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:24,030
- Someone didn't
find him amusing.

66
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,034
What a fuckin' tearjerker.

67
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,541
- He was such a nice guy.

68
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,946
He was the nicest guy
in all of show business.

69
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:44,350
Why would anyone want to
kill someone like him?

70
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,719
All of the little
girls just loved him.

71
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,956
We made such a great team.

72
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,290
It can't end like this.

73
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,425
What am I gonna do?

74
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,396
- Thank you, Mr. Ogata.

75
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:59,866
We've also received recent
reports that his outraged fans

76
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:02,702
have been arriving on the
scene in surprising numbers.

77
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,805
Such support is truly an
indication of mass popularity

78
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,408
and admiration on a grand scale.

79
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,643
According to inside
sources, however,

80
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:14,180
this case may also
involve organized crime.

81
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,982
I'm Miss Nagachima
for channel six.

82
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,216
- Nicely done.

83
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,518
- [Miss Nagachima]
Evening Edition.

84
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:22,288
- I can't stop thinking
about that old lady.

85
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:24,424
- People die everyday.

86
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,027
Come here, Sawa.

87
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,398
- I'm not in the mood.

88
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,442
(birds chirping)

89
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,390
- [Kanie] You ought to
be more punctual, Oburi.

90
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,357
- Who are we doing?

91
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,095
Which one, Kanie?

92
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,998
- All of them.

93
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,266
- [Oburi] Huh?

94
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,502
- We've called someone else in.

95
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,504
You concentrate on
the one in the front

96
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,273
and our associate will
take care of the other two.

97
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,843
- So, what did these
guys do anyway?

98
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,612
- The three of them are
child molesters, Oburi.

99
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,217
Let's just say they're going
to pay for their lifestyle.

100
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,467
- [Oburi Voiceover] So,
there's another one,

101
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,102
another one besides me.

102
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,620
- Yeah, how about
again this weekend?

103
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,954
Give me a call later.

104
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:03,990
I am, of course,
talking about our usual

105
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,626
recreational activities,
if you catch my drift.

106
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:09,095
My wife sure isn't getting
any younger, you know.

107
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:14,934
Hmm.

108
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,976
(explosion booming)

109
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,312
(screaming)

110
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,883
(gun firing)

111
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,986
(alarm bell ringing)

112
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:47,967
- Come on!

113
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,508
That surprise you?

114
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,343
- That was you back there?

115
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:58,177
- That's right.

116
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,349
(somber piano music)

117
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:15,328
(children yelling)

118
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:23,035
(keyboard clacking)

119
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,260
- You'll get your usual
fee, same as always.

120
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,028
Kanie will take
care of you later.

121
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,100
- You stink, Mr. Akai.

122
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,638
- Oburi, you don't
have a clue, do you?

123
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,775
Let me tell you
something about my job.

124
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:08,214
I spend all goddamned
day around dead bodies.

125
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,217
The corpses stink so
bad my eyes water.

126
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,186
The rotten stench hangs
over me like a cloud.

127
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,793
And you wonder why I
stink so fuckin' bad.

128
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,864
(keyboard clacking)

129
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,144
- So, Mr. Akai, have
you had a chance

130
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,912
to think about our discussion?

131
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,118
- Sure, kid.

132
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:47,787
Far be it from me
to hold you back.

133
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,089
- Oh really?

134
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,892
Your generosity never
ceases to amaze me.

135
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:59,632
- However, there is a matter
of three more little jobs.

136
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,834
- Had a feeling that was coming.

137
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:04,470
- Hey, you understand,
don't you, kid?

138
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,871
It's just business that's all.

139
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:08,140
Just taking care of business.

140
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,077
Right, Kanie, just
taking care of business.

141
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:16,315
- Mr. Kanie, I'll do my best
to be more punctual this time.

142
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,117
- Hmm?

143
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,924
(door clicking shut)

144
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,326
(jazz music)

145
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,497
- [Girl] Show me what you got!

146
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,766
- [Boy] Oh, well,
give me that ball!

147
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,002
- No way!
- It's my turn!

148
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:40,973
- [Girl] Uh-uh, watch it.

149
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:45,044
- Oh man!
- Oh shut up!

150
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,679
I'd like to see you do better!

151
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,547
- [Boy] All right, I'm
gonna go get that ball.

152
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:49,915
- [Girl] Hey,
wait, it's my turn!

153
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,184
- [Boy] Slow coach!

154
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:55,054
(children yelling)

155
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:02,695
- [Girl] Watch this shot!

156
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:06,232
It's gonna be the
prize shot of them all!

157
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,401
- [Boy] Ha-ha, you missed!

158
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,105
- Huh?

159
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:18,144
- Hey, mister, give
us our ball back!

160
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:21,614
- [Boy] Yeah, give
us our ball back!

161
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,649
- You got my jacket wet, kid.

162
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,718
- What that old piece of crap?

163
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:28,354
Go home and wash it
yourself, you old fart?

164
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,456
(laughing)

165
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,158
- [Boy] Yeah, you old fart!

166
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,393
(laughing)

167
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,199
- [Both] Whoa!

168
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:46,172
(gun firing)

169
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,474
(screaming)

170
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,483
(jazz music)

171
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,539
- He's very good, isn't he?

172
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,642
- That's why I need
you so much, Sawa.

173
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,379
(horn blaring)

174
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,790
- Here's your change, sir.

175
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,291
Thanks a lot, have a nice day.

176
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:43,796
- [Sawa] Psst, hey!

177
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:44,630
- Hmm?

178
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,511
- [Sawa] Nice apron.

179
00:12:58,511 --> 00:12:59,678
- Where'd you come from?

180
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,925
- [Sawa] Mm, this
is pretty good.

181
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,493
This must be a new flavor.

182
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:16,896
You want some?

183
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,399
- [Oburi] You asked Kanie
where I worked, didn't you?

184
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,667
- [Sawa] Mm-hm.

185
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,869
- So, what for?

186
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,605
- I don't know.

187
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,140
- Doesn't matter.

188
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,708
What's your name?

189
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:30,543
- Sawa.

190
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,446
As in the sand you can't hold

191
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,549
and the feather
blown by the wind.

192
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,883
Remember that, okay.

193
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:38,851
- Sawa?

194
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,286
Is that your real name?

195
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,520
- Of course.

196
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,354
- Well, my name is--

197
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:43,189
- Oburi.

198
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,023
You're Oburi, right?

199
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:48,894
- You seem to know more
about me than I do you.

200
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,596
- Are you mad at me?

201
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:51,931
- No, not really.

202
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,101
- Well, I asked Kanie where
you worked, that's all.

203
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:58,971
So, is Oburi your real name too?

204
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,839
- [Oburi] Yup, that's it.

205
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,641
- It's very unusual.

206
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,109
- [Oburi] Everyone says that.

207
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,315
- Do you have a family?

208
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,516
- Afraid not.

209
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,350
How about you?

210
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:13,752
- [Sawa] No.

211
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:14,720
Me neither.

212
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,858
Kind of alike, aren't we, Oburi?

213
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,761
- Kinda.

214
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,597
Sawa, can I ask you something?

215
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:30,169
- I'll tell you anything you
want to know about me, Oburi.

216
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:38,944
Huh?

217
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,988
(cat purring)

218
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,997
- So, what's Akai's
relationship to you, Sawa?

219
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:00,599
- Akai's my,

220
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,069
well, he's kinda
like a guardian.

221
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,906
- Same as me, huh?

222
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:10,175
Strange coincidence.

223
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,210
- [Sawa] Hmm.

224
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,111
- Don't you think?

225
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,848
(dramatic music)

226
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:32,524
(earring clanking)

227
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,630
Those earrings must
be special to you.

228
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,500
- Huh, what do you mean?

229
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,836
- You were wearing them
the first time I saw you.

230
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,803
Remember?

231
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:45,838
It was at the mall.

232
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,111
They look really
beautiful on you.

233
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,846
And mysterious.

234
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:59,651
- They were made from
the blood of my parents.

235
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:08,394
In memory of my
mother and father.

236
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,261
They're lucky.

237
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,334
Okay, let's go!

238
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,435
- Huh?

239
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,003
- Come on.

240
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:20,339
I wanna see where
you live, Oburi.

241
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:25,110
(bird squawking)

242
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:55,541
- Ah, shit!

243
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,511
Ah!

244
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,680
(giggling)

245
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:06,852
Hmm.

246
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,398
- [Sawa] Wait a
minute, isn't that?

247
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:20,899
- [Kanie] Yeah, you know him?

248
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,235
- [Sawa] Not really, but
he's a movie star, right?

249
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,237
- Mm.
- Some of the kids at college

250
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,371
are fans of his.

251
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,675
I didn't know he had
a twin brother though.

252
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,511
- [Kanie] They'll be
here in a few minutes.

253
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,715
- Kanie, this is
the third celebrity.

254
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,819
- Sawa, kill the right one.

255
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,155
- If I kill the wrong
one, I'm really sorry.

256
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,693
- They're going to have
three bodyguards with them.

257
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,328
So, be very careful.

258
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,601
- [Sawa] So, where
do I find him?

259
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,809
- Our collaboration
is working well

260
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,211
and it works because the
world knows both of us

261
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,980
as only one person.

262
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,415
The Academy is gonna have
to create a new category

263
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,684
for action hero just for us.

264
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,987
Too bad we can't grab
two Oscars for it.

265
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,223
I say next stop is
the director's chair

266
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:22,327
and squeeze the producer for
300-mil on our next action pic.

267
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,464
We'll keep half the money
and get another Oscar.

268
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,299
Well, any Oscar we don't win,

269
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,101
we can buy the rest!

270
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,336
(laughing)

271
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:34,773
- Uh!

272
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:35,607
Ah!

273
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:36,441
- Huh?

274
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,178
- Ah!

275
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,615
- Who the hell are you?

276
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,884
(grunting)

277
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,425
- It's a girl!

278
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:58,297
- Ah!

279
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,867
(groaning)

280
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:19,051
(energetic jazz music)

281
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,099
(gun firing)

282
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:47,646
- Hey!

283
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:49,948
- Ah!

284
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:52,351
(gun firing)

285
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,087
Uh!

286
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,456
(gun firing)

287
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:04,863
- Die!

288
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:06,932
Ah!

289
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,335
(gun firing)

290
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,403
Ah!

291
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:12,237
- Ah!

292
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,982
(groaning)

293
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:32,291
- You piece of shit, you!

294
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,363
I'm gonna kill you!

295
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:41,366
Ah!

296
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:55,681
Come here!

297
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:56,481
- Ah!

298
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:00,752
- Ah!

299
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:15,300
(gun firing)

300
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:27,646
- Impressive, my
cute little assassin.

301
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,147
Too bad you're gonna die ugly.

302
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:35,654
Don't move an inch!

303
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,290
(gun firing)

304
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,291
- [Sawa] Ah!

305
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,161
- What the fuck is that?

306
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:43,995
- Ah!

307
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:48,500
(explosion booming)

308
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:50,902
Ah!

309
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,841
(glass shattering)

310
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:01,246
- Huh!

311
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:04,850
Huh!

312
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:00,705
(dramatic music)

313
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,254
(screaming)

314
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:31,269
(groaning)

315
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,707
(gun firing)

316
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,846
(groaning)

317
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:54,025
- [Sawa] That's mine!

318
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:54,860
That's mine!

319
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,461
Give it back!

320
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:57,295
Give it back!

321
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:58,296
That's mine!

322
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:07,806
- Sawa.

323
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,941
You want mummy and daddy back.

324
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:13,545
Kill him.

325
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:20,318
Sawa, do you know
what this man does?

326
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:24,222
He kidnaps sweet,
young, innocent girls.

327
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:25,657
Just like you, Sawa.

328
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,226
He rapes them.

329
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:31,296
And he chops them up
into little pieces.

330
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:34,165
He deserves to die, Sawa.

331
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:35,767
Kill him, kill him.

332
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:38,203
(gun firing)

333
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,375
(jazz music)

334
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,300
- Find who killed my
mother and father.

335
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,001
You promised.

336
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:13,305
- Hey, of course I will, Sawa.

337
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:30,255
(dramatic music)

338
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,461
- Just die already!

339
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:48,640
(gun firing)

340
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:58,850
(screaming)

341
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,223
(gun firing)

342
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:17,602
(screaming)

343
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:36,921
(horns blaring)

344
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,263
(explosion booming)

345
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,167
(screaming)

346
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:09,254
(siren blaring)

347
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:18,897
- If we're lucky maybe
the killer got stupid

348
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:21,199
and left some evidence behind.

349
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,667
Man, we're gonna have
to search every inch

350
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,069
of this fucking mess.

351
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,605
- How do they expect us to
find anything in this war zone?

352
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:29,107
This is gonna take all day.

353
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,610
- That's why we make
the big bucks, ain't it?

354
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:40,752
Huh!

355
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:46,925
- Whoa.

356
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:51,463
Jesus, if you fell from here,

357
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,699
there wouldn't be anything
left for the coroner's office.

358
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:56,401
- Oh, you lucky little girl.

359
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,370
What the hell did
you do, grow wings?

360
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,839
- Huh?

361
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,908
- Hey, Akai, getting a little
tired of waiting out here!

362
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,343
- Yeah, we're done.

363
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:11,049
Hey, how come there's no
media monkeys hanging around?

364
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:14,119
- That's cause they all went
down to the precinct house.

365
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,420
- What, did they
finally find out

366
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,555
about the chief's
Lolita complex?

367
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,791
- Huh, you mean no one told ya?

368
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,226
They got a witness downtown.

369
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,727
Talking to him right now.

370
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:23,561
- Really?

371
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,202
This guy given us
anything useful?

372
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:32,070
- Not yet.

373
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:36,541
We keep working on him but I'm
afraid he's still in shock.

374
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,409
He did say it's a woman though.

375
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:39,277
- [Akai] A woman?

376
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,847
- Yeah, he said the
killer was a woman.

377
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:44,182
A young woman.

378
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:54,325
- Huh!

379
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:56,060
- I'm going back to look for it.

380
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:03,334
- Someone spotted you
at the scene, dammit!

381
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:04,569
- Why didn't you find it?

382
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,538
You were supposed
to find my earring.

383
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,006
- You destroyed half
of the building,

384
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,741
what the fuck did you expect?

385
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,578
You're lucky I found
the goddamned gun.

386
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:14,879
Fuck the earring.

387
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:17,015
- Those earrings are
really important to me

388
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,416
and you know that.

389
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,851
They're my family!

390
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:21,553
They're all I've got left.

391
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,656
- Get over it, you've
got another one.

392
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,394
Besides, we have a
slightly larger problem

393
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:32,030
to deal with now, thanks
to you, you little fool.

394
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,199
You killed the
goddamned client, Sawa.

395
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:37,035
- Well, Mr. Kanie gave
me the wrong information.

396
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:38,636
It's not my fault.

397
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:40,672
- I don't give a rat's ass.

398
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,407
- Then do it
yourself from now on!

399
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:43,174
- Hey!

400
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:50,381
Don't be gone too long, Sawa!

401
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:53,318
(door slamming)

402
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:55,954
(rain pounding)

403
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:17,508
- [Oburi] Sawa!

404
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:24,649
- What's up?

405
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:31,356
- What happened to you?

406
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:32,490
Are you okay?

407
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,025
- Does it look like I'm okay?

408
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:36,094
Feels like I fell
out of a building.

409
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,763
I even have a bald
spot and everything.

410
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:40,498
I'm exhausted.

411
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:41,699
- Do you wanna come in?

412
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,201
I can make some
coffee or something.

413
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:46,704
- I like tea, really
strong green tea.

414
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:50,241
- Ah tea, well,
I don't have any.

415
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,209
- I brought some.

416
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,319
- Ah!

417
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,287
- This tastes good.

418
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:09,894
- [Oburi] Sawa.

419
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,597
- What is it?

420
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,898
- In 10 years, what do you think

421
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:16,434
we'll be doing with our lives?

422
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,302
- Well, I don't know.

423
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:18,536
Why?

424
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:21,539
(telephone ringing)

425
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,108
- Just one target.

426
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,576
It's an easy job.

427
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:28,212
Meet me at the train station
just inside the front entrance.

428
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:31,616
You got that, Oburi?

429
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,352
And try to be
punctual this time.

430
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:38,623
- Sawa.

431
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:45,263
- Whether it's 10
years or even five,

432
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:48,166
tomorrow might not even
come for you and I, Oburi.

433
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:52,003
All we can ever do is live
our lives to the fullest.

434
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,940
There aren't any guarantees
for people like us.

435
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,508
We have to make it happen.

436
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,578
- [Oburi] Did Akai send you?

437
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:01,713
- He did.

438
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:04,015
You've become my next contract.

439
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,517
- Is that the only reason
you came here, Sawa?

440
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,820
- Do I have another reason?

441
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,954
Do I, Oburi?

442
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,558
- Akai and Kanie
killed your parents.

443
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:14,859
Did you know that, Sawa?

444
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,833
- I've known that for
a long time, Oburi.

445
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,940
(gun clicking)

446
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,977
You'll come back here
to get me, promise?

447
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,180
- Hmm.

448
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:41,519
- This guy's a prosecutor
with the DA's office.

449
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:46,491
He's been taking bribes
from a major corporation

450
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:49,193
while ignoring
illegal activities.

451
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,028
He'll be sitting in
the last train car

452
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:54,432
in about three minutes, so
take care of him there, Oburi.

453
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,635
- Sure doesn't look like a
government suit type to me.

454
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:59,036
- Be careful.

455
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,206
- I'll just try my best
to get there on time.

456
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:07,078
(energetic jazz music)

457
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:50,888
(explosion booming)

458
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,928
(energetic jazz music)

459
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,796
(gun firing)

460
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:00,998
(grunting)

461
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:06,370
(gun firing)

462
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,241
(dramatic music)

463
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:12,643
(gun firing)

464
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:36,267
- Ahh!

465
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:39,370
- Ah!

466
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:47,211
Ah!

467
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,817
Who the hell are you?

468
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,285
- No one special.

469
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:56,387
I'm just an ordinary citizen.

470
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:57,221
Die.

471
00:35:58,756 --> 00:35:59,590
Ah!

472
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,796
(dramatic music)

473
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,437
You punk!

474
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:15,940
I'm gonna blow you into pieces!

475
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,243
- The one in pieces is you, pig!

476
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:22,180
(gun firing)

477
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,448
(man screaming)

478
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,451
(explosion booming)

479
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,656
(screaming)

480
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,576
(humming)

481
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,141
(groaning)

482
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:27,678
- Sorry, Akai, I hate
to inconvenience you.

483
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:31,816
- Oburi, looks like you
got something on your mind.

484
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:33,184
- [Oburi] Oh, fuck you!

485
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:35,419
I should kill you now,
you son of a bitch!

486
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,787
- Just relax, kid.

487
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:38,055
- Relax!

488
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:40,558
Who the fuck was that
fat pig on the train?

489
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:42,059
- Just a cop.

490
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:45,229
Just some stupid, fucking
cop from the SWAT team.

491
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:47,298
I thought Kanie told
you that, I swear.

492
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,233
- Well, that cop had a piece.

493
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,035
He tried to take me out!

494
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,272
- Sorry, kid.

495
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,906
Maybe he didn't want to die.

496
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:57,608
- Shut the fuck up, Akai.

497
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,677
I'm sick of your bullshit.

498
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:02,713
You can kiss my ass
good-bye, I'm out.

499
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:05,716
And if you even try to come
after me, I'll kill you.

500
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:06,684
- Wait a minute.

501
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:10,988
Aren't you forgetting about
our little deal, Oburi?

502
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:12,456
- Do it your damned self.

503
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,326
- What about Sawa?

504
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:16,761
- She's coming with me.

505
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:19,397
- I see.

506
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:22,700
(grunting and groaning)

507
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:28,339
(gun firing)

508
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:33,577
(groaning)

509
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,914
Fuck!

510
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:43,287
Jesus, you're more
trouble than you're worth.

511
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:45,122
- What's all the noise?

512
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:46,323
- You!

513
00:38:46,323 --> 00:38:47,958
I thought you were
dead, you little punk!

514
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:51,295
(gun firing)

515
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:54,632
- Get away!

516
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,534
I said get away from him!

517
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:57,368
- Sawa.

518
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:02,940
- [Sawa] Oburi, hang on!

519
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,175
I'll get you out of here.

520
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,010
Oburi!

521
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:08,879
- Sawa.

522
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:10,881
What are you doing here?

523
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,583
- Can you stand?

524
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:13,651
- [Oburi] I think so.

525
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:18,122
My arm, I can't feel it.

526
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,991
- We've got to get
you to a doctor.

527
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:27,732
Don't even move!

528
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,137
(gun firing)

529
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:40,978
- Sawa.

530
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:44,348
- Oburi, don't worry,
I'm not gonna kill ya.

531
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:50,287
Sawa, you should thank me.

532
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,135
- If you're just going
to kill him anyway,

533
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:06,137
you didn't have to
go through all this.

534
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:08,739
- Just killing him isn't
enough for me, Sawa.

535
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,041
- You hate him
that much, do you?

536
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,676
- It's deeper than that.

537
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:15,212
It's my, how shall I say, hobby.

538
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:16,046
- Hobby?

539
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:18,883
- You'll never understand
how much watching

540
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:20,885
other people's pain gets me off.

541
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,687
Hearing their
screams and knowing

542
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:25,990
that I have the power of a God.

543
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:26,857
- Gross hobby.

544
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,463
- You had me going for
a little while there.

545
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:35,733
I almost believed
you'd betray me.

546
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:38,769
- So, I'll be on my
own from now on, right?

547
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,605
- Don't worry, we've
already found a replacement.

548
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:44,708
- Where are you
going to kill him?

549
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:47,645
- In the place where you tasted
blood for the first time.

550
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,982
Awwh, man, I can't wait
for tomorrow's autopsy.

551
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:54,552
- [Sawa] I've got to go.

552
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,354
- Stay with me, Sawa.

553
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:00,157
- [Sawa] I have
an exam tomorrow.

554
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:03,494
- [Akai] Why don't you give
up that stupid college shit?

555
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:04,929
- No way.

556
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:06,897
I look better with pencils
than I do with guns.

557
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:07,731
Don't you think?

558
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:12,169
- [Man] Death caused
by massive blood loss.

559
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:15,272
He's been shot five
or six times at least.

560
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:17,374
- [Akai] Why the hell do you
guys have to drag me out here

561
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:19,343
and see this shit
before my breakfast?

562
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:20,744
He's not going anywhere.

563
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:22,146
- [Man] We did most
of the grunt work

564
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,714
before you got here, boss.

565
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:25,549
- Hmm, thanks for nothing.

566
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,154
Huh!

567
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:33,591
- [Man] Something wrong, sir?

568
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:36,093
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

569
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:36,927
Did you know him?

570
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:38,762
- [Sawa] Huh.

571
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:39,630
No, no.

572
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,531
- Wait a minute.

573
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:41,599
You know something?

574
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,367
We've been here.

575
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:45,069
I know it's a parking lot now,

576
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:47,271
but do you remember
about four years ago

577
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:49,707
when we investigated
that family homicide?

578
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,275
- Four years ago?

579
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:53,277
- [Man] Yeah, you remember,
that double murder.

580
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:55,079
Real messy investigation.

581
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,580
Only survivor was
the little girl.

582
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,616
I heard she got
adopted or something.

583
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:00,284
What a sexy little thing.

584
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,319
I'll bet she's hotter
than a pistol by now.

585
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,587
You got to remember her?

586
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:05,656
- Oburi.

587
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:10,094
(water pattering)

588
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,644
I got to tell you, Oburi,

589
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:30,414
I really didn't think you
had the balls to kill Kanie.

590
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:32,449
But we both know that in
your present condition,

591
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:34,285
you won't be able
to take me down.

592
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:35,452
Isn't that right?

593
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:42,159
I should have done
this a long time ago.

594
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,032
(gun clicking)

595
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:49,967
Awwh, come on kid, we both know

596
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:52,536
you don't have the strength
to pull that trigger.

597
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:54,638
How's the shoulder, Oburi?

598
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:56,774
(gun firing)

599
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:57,575
Sawa?

600
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,448
What's going on here, Sawa?

601
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:05,649
(gun firing)

602
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:07,318
(groaning)

603
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:08,152
My hand!

604
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:10,487
You bitch, you bitch!

605
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:11,689
Goddamned you!

606
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:13,857
- [Sawa] I killed Kanie.

607
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:15,392
Oburi is fine.

608
00:43:16,593 --> 00:43:19,563
- You ungrateful whore,
you and Oburi set me up.

609
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:20,397
But why?

610
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:21,598
- You bastard!

611
00:43:21,598 --> 00:43:23,968
I've waited a long
time for this.

612
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:28,172
This is for my
parents and for me.

613
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,641
- Sawa!

614
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:33,043
(gun firing)

615
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,554
(soft music)

616
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:36,607
(gun firing)

617
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,415
- [Boy] Where have you been?

618
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,616
- [Girl] None of your business.

619
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:47,051
- [Boy] What do you mean
none of my business?

620
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:49,019
- [Girl] Exactly that,
it's none of your business.

621
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,422
(soft music)

622
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:55,793
- Be patient my friends.

623
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:01,832
Very soon, Oburi
will come home to us.

624
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:05,269
(cat purring)

625
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:08,739
Right?

626
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:17,514
(soft music)
