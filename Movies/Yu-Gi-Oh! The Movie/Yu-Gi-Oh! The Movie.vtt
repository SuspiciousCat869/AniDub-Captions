NARRATOR: Long ago, when the
pyramids were still young,

00:00:24.581 --> 00:00:28.818 position:10% line:83% align:start
Egyptian kings played a game
of great and terrible power.

00:00:28.885 --> 00:00:33.722 position:7% line:83% align:start
They did battle with magic and
monsters for riches and glory.

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:36.759 position:24% line:83% align:start
From these shadow
games erupted a war

00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:39.527 position:24% line:83% align:start
that threatened to
destroy the world

00:00:39.594 --> 00:00:43.430 position:13% line:83% align:start
until a brave and powerful
pharaoh locked the dark magic

00:00:43.497 --> 00:00:46.600 position:21% line:83% align:start
away, imprisoning it
for all eternity within

00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:49.735 position:7% line:89% align:start
the mystical Millennium items.

00:00:49.802 --> 00:00:53.304 position:24% line:83% align:start
But even eternity
doesn't last forever.

00:00:58.977 --> 00:01:00.745 position:16% line:89% align:start
It was never to happen.

00:01:00.812 --> 00:01:03.914 position:30% line:83% align:start
And for 5,000
years, it never did.

00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:06.449 position:24% line:83% align:start
The secrets of the
Millennium Puzzle

00:01:06.516 --> 00:01:08.718 position:27% line:83% align:start
remained safely
beyond reach within

00:01:08.785 --> 00:01:14.356 position:13% line:83% align:start
the imponderable conundrum
of its intricate design.

00:01:14.422 --> 00:01:17.491 position:13% line:83% align:start
For a boy named Yugi, the
mystery of the Millennium

00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:19.627 position:13% line:89% align:start
Puzzle remains just that.

00:01:19.693 --> 00:01:23.130 position:21% line:83% align:start
The solution, if one
exists, eludes him as it

00:01:23.197 --> 00:01:24.732 position:10% line:89% align:start
did those that came before.

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:25.832 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Ugh.

time, fate has

00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:29.936 position:13% line:83% align:start
played a hand in bringing
the puzzle and this

00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:31.403 position:27% line:89% align:start
person together.

[thunder]

00:01:37.708 --> 00:01:39.811 position:16% line:89% align:start
It was never to happen.

00:01:39.877 --> 00:01:43.580 position:30% line:83% align:start
And for 5,000
years, it never did.

00:01:43.647 --> 00:01:45.515 position:30% line:83% align:start
But while the
desert does its best

00:01:45.582 --> 00:01:48.785 position:19% line:83% align:start
to conceal that which
should remain buried,

00:01:48.852 --> 00:01:53.155 position:7% line:83% align:start
it eventually yields its most
ancient and terrible secrets.

00:01:53.222 --> 00:01:55.857 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Ugh.

00:01:55.924 --> 00:01:58.726 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ah.

00:01:58.793 --> 00:01:59.761 position:33% line:89% align:start
We found it.

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:02.796 position:16% line:89% align:start
The lost tomb of Anubis.

 Professor, what
do you make of this?

00:02:19.743 --> 00:02:21.078 position:30% line:89% align:start
 It's amazing.

00:02:21.145 --> 00:02:23.881 position:13% line:83% align:start
What possessed them to put
the sarcophagus in chains?

00:02:27.517 --> 00:02:28.017 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Hey.

00:02:28.084 --> 00:02:30.586 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right.

00:02:30.652 --> 00:02:34.623 position:21% line:89% align:start
Maybe this one next.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:35.523 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.592 position:35% line:89% align:start
One to go.

00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:41.696 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've almost solved
the Millennium Puzzle.

00:02:41.762 --> 00:02:43.563 position:16% line:89% align:start

going to be surprised

00:02:59.677 --> 00:03:02.713 position:10% line:83% align:start
when he sees I figured this
puzzle out all by myself.

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:03.580 position:27% line:89% align:start
The last piece.

00:03:06.616 --> 00:03:07.416 position:33% line:89% align:start
This is it.

00:03:11.787 --> 00:03:12.721 position:44% line:89% align:start
 Ah.

00:03:12.787 --> 00:03:14.223 position:44% line:89% align:start

ANNOUNCER (ON TV): In the three
short years since he started

00:05:44.781 --> 00:05:46.916 position:19% line:83% align:start
playing Duel Monsters,
Yugi Moto has

00:05:46.983 --> 00:05:50.719 position:7% line:83% align:start
risen to international stardom
by becoming the worldwide Duel

00:05:50.786 --> 00:05:52.988 position:5% line:89% align:start
Monsters card playing champion.

00:05:53.055 --> 00:05:56.057 position:13% line:83% align:start
But what makes this young
man such a talented duelist?

00:05:56.124 --> 00:05:58.092 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is it his masterful strategies?

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:00.994 position:19% line:83% align:start
Or does the secret lie
in the powerful God Cards

00:06:01.061 --> 00:06:02.796 position:10% line:89% align:start
he's assembled in his deck?

00:06:02.863 --> 00:06:05.731 position:13% line:83% align:start
Whatever the reason, Yugi
has proven his dueling

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:07.733 position:16% line:89% align:start
prowess time and again.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.003 position:5% line:83% align:start
He has reigned victorious in the
most prestigious tournaments,

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.639 position:7% line:83% align:start
including the Duelist Kingdom
Competition, and most recently

00:06:14.706 --> 00:06:16.741 position:27% line:83% align:start
the Battle City
Finals, where once

00:06:16.808 --> 00:06:20.744 position:13% line:83% align:start
again Yugi defeated former
champ Seto Kaiba to win it all.

00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:22.046 position:24% line:89% align:start
 Give me a break.

00:06:22.112 --> 00:06:23.981 position:13% line:83% align:start
I bet I could duel circles
around this little high

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:26.983 position:16% line:83% align:start
ANNOUNCER (ON TV): Yugi
says his success is

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.718 position:35% line:83% align:start
due to his
grandfather's coaching

00:06:28.785 --> 00:06:31.053 position:21% line:83% align:start
and to his belief in
the heart of the cards.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.954 position:27% line:83% align:start
 If he'd play me
for those God Cards,

00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:34.923 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'd take that chump
down in a flash.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.991 position:24% line:83% align:start
ANNOUNCER (ON TV):
But others say

00:06:36.058 --> 00:06:38.626 position:27% line:83% align:start
it is the three
Egyptian God Cards that

00:06:38.692 --> 00:06:40.795 position:5% line:89% align:start
make Yugi virtually unbeatable.

00:06:40.861 --> 00:06:43.029 position:7% line:89% align:start
And so the gauntlet is thrown.

00:06:43.096 --> 00:06:46.933 position:5% line:83% align:start
Can anyone defeat Yugi Moto and
his unstoppable Egyptian

00:06:53.105 --> 00:06:54.540 position:27% line:89% align:start
You've got one.

are going to end differently,

you pompous windbag.

admit that your Blue Eyes

White Dragon is powerless
against my Egyptian God Cards.

this, there's got to be

00:07:13.788 --> 00:07:15.790 position:7% line:89% align:start
a way to beat your God Cards.

00:07:15.857 --> 00:07:18.059 position:27% line:83% align:start

attack points, Mega Morph.

00:07:47.117 --> 00:07:49.051 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now my Blue Eyes

00:07:49.118 --> 00:07:51.086 position:7% line:11% align:start
than any monster on the field.

00:07:51.153 --> 00:07:54.089 position:19% line:83% align:start
 There's more to power
than just attack points.

00:07:54.156 --> 00:07:55.290 position:44% line:89% align:start
 Ha!

00:07:55.357 --> 00:07:57.225 position:19% line:83% align:start
And just what is that
supposed to mean?

00:07:57.291 --> 00:08:00.727 position:13% line:83% align:start
 It means my Egyptian God
Cards possess powers far

00:08:00.794 --> 00:08:01.962 position:19% line:89% align:start
beyond mere monsters.

 They what?

00:08:03.396 --> 00:08:07.199 position:5% line:83% align:start
YUGI: By sacrificing two, I can
bestow upon the third

00:08:07.267 --> 00:08:10.169 position:24% line:89% align:start
infinite strength.

 No.

00:08:27.316 --> 00:08:28.985 position:13% line:89% align:start
I can beat your God Cards.

00:15:49.584 --> 00:15:50.685 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I haven't seen
this many people

00:15:50.752 --> 00:15:51.553 position:21% line:83% align:start
running from school
since they served

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.355 position:10% line:89% align:start
meatloaf surprise last year.

00:15:54.421 --> 00:15:56.156 position:30% line:89% align:start
What in the--

00:15:56.223 --> 00:15:58.124 position:33% line:89% align:start
 Let me see.

00:15:58.191 --> 00:16:01.194 position:19% line:83% align:start
 Wonder who these guys
are all waiting for?

00:16:01.261 --> 00:16:02.195 position:24% line:89% align:start
DUELIST: It's him.

00:16:02.262 --> 00:16:03.396 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [gasp]

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:05.632 position:21% line:83% align:start
 Told you he's a lot
smaller than on TV.

00:16:05.698 --> 00:16:06.265 position:35% line:89% align:start
 Me first.

00:16:06.331 --> 00:16:07.466 position:30% line:89% align:start
Let me at him.

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:11.168 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Please just give me one
shot at those God Cards.

00:16:11.235 --> 00:16:12.336 position:21% line:89% align:start
 Get out of my way.

00:16:12.403 --> 00:16:14.171 position:24% line:83% align:start
If anyone gets the
God Cards, it's me.

00:16:14.238 --> 00:16:15.873 position:35% line:89% align:start
 Help me.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.608 position:27% line:83% align:start
 What's going on
with these guys?

00:16:17.675 --> 00:16:18.843 position:19% line:89% align:start
 Life at the top, Téa.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.611 position:19% line:83% align:start
Everyone knows Yugi's
the best duelist around.

00:16:21.678 --> 00:16:24.580 position:16% line:83% align:start
So they all want a piece
of him and those God Cards.

00:16:24.648 --> 00:16:26.415 position:21% line:83% align:start
 Téa, try and sneak
Yuge out around

00:16:26.482 --> 00:16:28.116 position:10% line:89% align:start
back while we hold them off.

00:16:28.182 --> 00:16:29.317 position:33% line:83% align:start
- You sure?
- Yeah.

00:16:29.384 --> 00:16:30.618 position:21% line:83% align:start
Me and Tristan will
handle things here.

00:16:30.686 --> 00:16:31.452 position:30% line:89% align:start
 Thanks, Joey.

00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:32.554 position:13% line:89% align:start
 You can thank him later.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:33.888 position:27% line:89% align:start
Let's go, Yugi.

00:16:33.955 --> 00:16:34.589 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Hey.

00:16:38.625 --> 00:16:40.192 position:21% line:89% align:start
 The usual plan, T.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.895 position:21% line:89% align:start
 On three, partner.

00:16:41.962 --> 00:16:43.329 position:33% line:83% align:start
BOTH: Three.
- Quick.

00:16:43.396 --> 00:16:44.230 position:33% line:89% align:start
After them.

00:16:44.297 --> 00:16:47.399 position:7% line:89% align:start
 Forget about those nobodies.

00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:48.901 position:16% line:89% align:start
 Now wait just a minute.

00:16:48.968 --> 00:16:50.168 position:24% line:89% align:start
What did you say?

00:16:50.235 --> 00:16:51.469 position:19% line:89% align:start
 I said you're nobody.

00:16:51.536 --> 00:16:52.102 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Yeah.

00:16:52.169 --> 00:16:52.971 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:16:53.038 --> 00:16:54.238 position:10% line:89% align:start
And everybody knows it too.

00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:57.141 position:19% line:83% align:start
 Well, just everybody
who's anybody that is.

00:16:57.207 --> 00:16:58.642 position:33% line:89% align:start
 Listen up.

00:16:58.709 --> 00:17:00.643 position:10% line:83% align:start
Nobody but nobody calls me a
nobody, you bunch of nobodies.

00:17:00.711 --> 00:17:01.544 position:35% line:89% align:start
Got that?

00:17:01.611 --> 00:17:02.579 position:27% line:89% align:start
 Out of the way.

00:17:02.645 --> 00:17:04.380 position:27% line:83% align:start
We want to take
on Yugi, not you.

00:17:04.447 --> 00:17:05.715 position:30% line:89% align:start
 Yeah, right.

00:17:05.782 --> 00:17:07.583 position:21% line:83% align:start
 We want the King of
Games, not the King of Lame.

00:17:07.649 --> 00:17:09.585 position:21% line:83% align:start
 The Duel Monsters'
champ, not chump.

00:17:09.651 --> 00:17:12.253 position:16% line:83% align:start
 The Master of the Gods,
not the Master of the Clods.

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.422 position:21% line:83% align:start
 Hey, I think I get
the point already.

00:17:14.488 --> 00:17:15.756 position:30% line:83% align:start
But you got to
prove yourself first

00:17:15.823 --> 00:17:18.726 position:10% line:83% align:start
by dueling a top contender,
and I think I know one.

00:17:18.793 --> 00:17:20.160 position:33% line:89% align:start
 Seto Kaiba?

00:17:20.226 --> 00:17:21.428 position:24% line:89% align:start
 Me, Joey Wheeler.

00:17:21.494 --> 00:17:23.429 position:19% line:83% align:start
So if you want to get
to the King of Games,

00:17:23.495 --> 00:17:25.698 position:24% line:83% align:start
you'll have to go
through me, the uh-- uh--

00:17:25.764 --> 00:17:28.232 position:13% line:83% align:start
(GODFATHER IMPRESSION) the
Godfather of Games, capisce?

00:17:38.508 --> 00:17:39.142 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right.

00:17:39.209 --> 00:17:40.377 position:24% line:89% align:start
So who wants some?

00:17:40.444 --> 00:17:41.712 position:19% line:89% align:start
DUELIST: I want some.

00:17:41.778 --> 00:17:43.312 position:27% line:89% align:start
Won't take long.

00:17:43.379 --> 00:17:44.413 position:30% line:89% align:start
Let's do this.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.047 position:44% line:89% align:start
 OK.

00:17:45.113 --> 00:17:47.282 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ladies first.

00:17:47.349 --> 00:17:48.183 position:44% line:89% align:start
 Ha.

00:17:48.249 --> 00:17:48.751 position:41% line:89% align:start
Funny.

00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:50.485 position:35% line:89% align:start
Take this.

00:17:50.552 --> 00:17:53.420 position:16% line:83% align:start
I summon Injection Fairy
Lily in attack mode.

00:17:57.424 --> 00:17:58.626 position:35% line:89% align:start
 Hi there.

00:17:58.692 --> 00:17:59.860 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Huh?

00:17:59.927 --> 00:18:03.329 position:21% line:83% align:start
 [grunt] Let's give
him a check-up, Lily.

00:18:03.396 --> 00:18:04.731 position:35% line:89% align:start
 Say ahh.

00:18:04.797 --> 00:18:05.497 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Ahh!

00:18:05.565 --> 00:18:08.533 position:19% line:89% align:start
What the-- [screams].

00:18:13.838 --> 00:18:16.474 position:21% line:83% align:start
 I sacrifice Fenril
and Inpachi in order

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:17.540 position:16% line:89% align:start
to summon Maju Garzett.

00:18:22.545 --> 00:18:23.445 position:38% line:89% align:start
Attack!

00:18:23.512 --> 00:18:25.414 position:21% line:89% align:start
Sludge regurgitate.

00:18:25.481 --> 00:18:27.282 position:33% line:89% align:start
 [belching]

00:18:31.552 --> 00:18:35.389 position:7% line:83% align:start
 Hey, didn't nobody ever teach
you, you say it not spray it?

00:18:35.455 --> 00:18:36.757 position:30% line:89% align:start
Some manners.

00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:37.491 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, boy.

00:18:37.557 --> 00:18:38.959 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now, you're in trouble.

00:18:39.026 --> 00:18:43.496 position:5% line:83% align:start
I sacrifice Baby Dragon, Rocket
Warrior, and Little Wing God

00:18:43.562 --> 00:18:46.565 position:24% line:83% align:start
to summon Gilford
the Lightning, which

00:18:46.632 --> 00:18:49.401 position:7% line:83% align:start
means all the monsters you got
out on the field are

00:18:49.467 --> 00:18:50.635 position:27% line:89% align:start
destroyed, pal.

00:18:50.702 --> 00:18:51.569 position:27% line:89% align:start
Lightning sword.

00:18:59.442 --> 00:19:00.243 position:35% line:89% align:start
 Ah, nuts.

00:19:02.612 --> 00:19:06.648 position:5% line:83% align:start
 [laughs] Maybe now you'll have
the proper respect for Joey,

00:19:06.715 --> 00:19:09.317 position:16% line:89% align:start
the Godfather of Games.

00:19:09.384 --> 00:19:11.452 position:7% line:89% align:start
 Is the coast clear yet, Joey?

00:19:11.519 --> 00:19:12.520 position:27% line:89% align:start
 Hey, it's Yugi.

00:19:12.586 --> 00:19:13.788 position:35% line:89% align:start
He's back.

00:19:13.854 --> 00:19:14.789 position:27% line:89% align:start
 Let's go, Yugi.

00:19:14.855 --> 00:19:16.757 position:19% line:89% align:start
 You better watch out.

00:19:16.824 --> 00:19:18.391 position:21% line:89% align:start
We're gonna get you.

00:19:22.696 --> 00:19:23.763 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Yeah.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.531 position:24% line:89% align:start
They respect you.

00:19:25.597 --> 00:19:27.499 position:5% line:89% align:start
 I could have been a contender.

00:19:30.501 --> 00:19:31.402 position:30% line:89% align:start
 Quick, Yugi.

00:19:31.469 --> 00:19:32.303 position:35% line:89% align:start
This way.

00:19:34.505 --> 00:19:35.305 position:27% line:89% align:start
 Where'd he go?

00:19:35.372 --> 00:19:36.206 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Whoa.

00:19:36.273 --> 00:19:37.075 position:7% line:89% align:start
Those guys just won't give up.

00:19:37.141 --> 00:19:38.575 position:5% line:89% align:start
We need to find a place to hide.

00:19:38.642 --> 00:19:42.278 position:7% line:83% align:start
Someplace where we'll be safe
from that Duel Monster mob,

00:19:42.344 --> 00:19:44.680 position:10% line:89% align:start
someplace they'd never look.

00:19:44.747 --> 00:19:46.816 position:13% line:83% align:start
MAX-A-MILLION PEGASUS: So
what do you think, Kaiba boy?

00:19:46.882 --> 00:19:50.685 position:13% line:83% align:start
Is this the latest in duel
arena technology or what?

00:19:50.752 --> 00:19:53.054 position:30% line:83% align:start
 This place is
an outdated joke.

00:19:53.121 --> 00:19:54.421 position:21% line:89% align:start
But then so are you.

00:19:54.488 --> 00:19:55.856 position:19% line:89% align:start
So I suppose it fits.

00:19:55.923 --> 00:19:57.057 position:24% line:89% align:start
 Now, now, Kaiba.

00:19:57.124 --> 00:20:01.061 position:21% line:83% align:start
Let's not get nasty,
not just yet anyhow.

00:20:01.128 --> 00:20:01.761 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Look.

00:20:01.828 --> 00:20:04.630 position:24% line:89% align:start
Enough small talk.

00:20:04.697 --> 00:20:05.765 position:24% line:11% align:start
BOTH: Let's duel.

00:20:05.832 --> 00:20:09.434 position:16% line:89% align:start
 I'll start things off.

00:20:09.501 --> 00:20:10.869 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh dear.

00:20:10.936 --> 00:20:12.770 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid you're about to
enter into a world of pain,

00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:15.539 position:10% line:11% align:start
Kaiba boy, a world of chaos.

00:20:15.606 --> 00:20:18.308 position:10% line:89% align:start
A world of absolute mayhem.

00:20:18.374 --> 00:20:21.478 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's right, a World of Toons.

00:20:25.814 --> 00:20:27.049 position:44% line:89% align:start
 Ha!

00:20:27.116 --> 00:20:28.851 position:13% line:83% align:start
Don't tell me that you're
actually still using

00:20:28.917 --> 00:20:30.818 position:7% line:89% align:start
that idiotic Toon World card.

00:20:30.885 --> 00:20:32.253 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [groan]

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.889 position:13% line:83% align:start
 Well, this is going to be
even easier than I thought.

00:20:34.956 --> 00:20:40.827 position:19% line:83% align:start
 [grunt] I summon Toon
Gemini Elf in attack mode.

00:20:40.894 --> 00:20:43.763 position:27% line:89% align:start
BOTH: [giggling]

00:20:46.431 --> 00:20:48.433 position:21% line:89% align:start
 And this for later.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.401 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's your turn, Kaiba boy.

00:20:55.806 --> 00:20:57.541 position:16% line:89% align:start
 I summon X-Head Cannon.

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:05.882 position:21% line:83% align:start
Also, I'll throw two
cards face down for later.

00:21:05.948 --> 00:21:06.648 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Ooh.

00:21:06.715 --> 00:21:08.617 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm so scared, Kaiba.

00:21:08.683 --> 00:21:10.118 position:21% line:89% align:start
Two cards face down.

00:21:10.185 --> 00:21:11.352 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, mercy me.

00:21:11.418 --> 00:21:12.820 position:27% line:89% align:start
What will I do?

00:21:12.887 --> 00:21:13.788 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, wait a minute.

00:21:13.854 --> 00:21:15.489 position:38% line:89% align:start
I know.

00:21:15.556 --> 00:21:16.523 position:35% line:89% align:start
Play this.

00:21:16.589 --> 00:21:17.624 position:24% line:89% align:start
Card of Sanctity.

00:21:20.193 --> 00:21:21.326 position:27% line:89% align:start
Isn't it pretty?

00:21:21.393 --> 00:21:23.729 position:16% line:83% align:start
And it allows us each to
draw until we both have

00:21:23.796 --> 00:21:24.830 position:19% line:89% align:start
six cards in our hand.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.500 position:21% line:89% align:start
Just what I needed.

00:21:29.567 --> 00:21:31.702 position:19% line:83% align:start
And now I'll activate
the magic card

00:21:31.769 --> 00:21:33.704 position:7% line:89% align:start
Cost Down, which means that--

00:21:33.771 --> 00:21:35.572 position:19% line:89% align:start
 Do you ever shut up?

00:21:35.639 --> 00:21:36.907 position:19% line:89% align:start
I know what it means.

00:21:36.973 --> 00:21:39.509 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now you can summon your
strongest monsters to the field

00:21:39.576 --> 00:21:40.509 position:33% line:89% align:start
more easily.

00:21:40.576 --> 00:21:41.744 position:38% line:89% align:start
Please.

00:21:41.811 --> 00:21:43.579 position:16% line:83% align:start
What do you take me for,
some kind of a rookie?

00:21:43.646 --> 00:21:45.781 position:24% line:83% align:start
 You're not quite
that good, Kaiba boy.

00:21:45.848 --> 00:21:48.683 position:24% line:83% align:start
I summon the Toon
Dark Magician Girl.

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:49.884 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Mmm.

00:21:49.951 --> 00:21:50.952 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ha.

00:21:51.019 --> 00:21:53.420 position:27% line:83% align:start
 But I won't be
using her just yet.

00:21:53.487 --> 00:21:56.824 position:24% line:83% align:start
First, I'll attack
with the Gemini Elves,

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:58.892 position:27% line:83% align:start
and I think I'll
have them target--

00:21:58.959 --> 00:22:00.793 position:19% line:89% align:start
TOON GEMINI ELVES: Ah.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.395 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Ugh.

00:22:02.461 --> 00:22:03.796 position:10% line:89% align:start
MAX-A-MILLION PEGASUS: You.

00:22:03.863 --> 00:22:04.730 position:19% line:89% align:start
TOON GEMINI ELVES: Ha.

00:22:04.797 --> 00:22:06.165 position:41% line:11% align:start
 Ugh.

00:22:06.232 --> 00:22:08.900 position:27% line:83% align:start
 Cartoons are so
violent these days,

00:22:08.967 --> 00:22:10.501 position:13% line:89% align:start
but we're not through yet.

00:22:10.568 --> 00:22:12.636 position:7% line:89% align:start
My elves have another ability.

00:22:12.703 --> 00:22:14.672 position:30% line:83% align:start
When they deal
damage to a player,

00:22:14.738 --> 00:22:16.874 position:21% line:83% align:start
that player loses a
card from his hand.

00:22:16.941 --> 00:22:18.075 position:7% line:89% align:start
TOON GEMINI ELVES: [giggling]

00:22:18.142 --> 00:22:21.811 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Aren't my toons simply
magnificent, Kaiba boy?

00:22:21.878 --> 00:22:22.812 position:19% line:89% align:start
TOON GEMINI ELVES: Hm.

00:22:22.879 --> 00:22:23.812 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [grunt]

00:22:23.879 --> 00:22:25.914 position:16% line:89% align:start
 Oh, don't look so sour.

00:22:25.981 --> 00:22:26.949 position:19% line:89% align:start
Think of it this way.

00:22:27.015 --> 00:22:28.817 position:24% line:83% align:start
At least, it will
be them stopping

00:22:28.884 --> 00:22:31.419 position:21% line:83% align:start
your little quest to
the top and not Yugi boy

00:22:31.485 --> 00:22:32.820 position:16% line:89% align:start
for the umpteenth time.

00:22:32.887 --> 00:22:34.521 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now then, let's get on with it.

00:22:34.588 --> 00:22:35.622 position:35% line:89% align:start
Shall we?

00:22:35.689 --> 00:22:38.692 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, Toon Dark Magician
Girl, your turn.

00:22:38.758 --> 00:22:40.526 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Ooh.

00:22:40.593 --> 00:22:42.428 position:24% line:83% align:start
 I guess it's true
that when you get old,

00:22:42.494 --> 00:22:43.762 position:27% line:83% align:start
the mind is the
first thing to go.

00:22:43.829 --> 00:22:46.832 position:19% line:83% align:start
Because you forgot all
about my face down cards.

00:22:46.899 --> 00:22:50.835 position:5% line:89% align:start
And now, it's going to cost you.

00:22:50.902 --> 00:22:52.770 position:44% line:89% align:start
 Ah?

00:22:52.837 --> 00:22:54.239 position:16% line:89% align:start
 Attack guidance armor.

00:22:54.305 --> 00:22:57.608 position:13% line:83% align:start
This trap's like a magnet
that redirects your own attack

00:22:57.674 --> 00:22:58.842 position:24% line:89% align:start
right back at you.

00:22:58.909 --> 00:22:59.977 position:24% line:89% align:start
 No, you wouldn't.

00:23:00.043 --> 00:23:00.910 position:35% line:89% align:start
ALL: Huh?

00:23:00.977 --> 00:23:01.644 position:35% line:89% align:start
 Oh, yes.

00:23:01.711 --> 00:23:02.979 position:21% line:89% align:start
I would, and I will.

00:23:03.045 --> 00:23:07.883 position:19% line:83% align:start
Guidance Armor, attach
to the Toon Gemini Elves.

00:23:07.949 --> 00:23:10.551 position:5% line:89% align:start
TOON GEMINI ELVES: [whimpering]

00:23:18.925 --> 00:23:20.493 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.795 position:44% line:89% align:start
 Aw.

00:23:22.862 --> 00:23:25.797 position:24% line:89% align:start
BOTH: [whimpering]

00:23:27.799 --> 00:23:29.734 position:35% line:89% align:start
 [giggles]

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.870 position:30% line:83% align:start
 But they were
just innocent toons.

00:23:32.937 --> 00:23:35.538 position:21% line:89% align:start
You'll pay for that.

00:23:35.605 --> 00:23:37.741 position:30% line:83% align:start
I activate the
magic card Monster

00:23:37.807 --> 00:23:41.644 position:13% line:89% align:start
Reborn to bring them back.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:42.878 position:35% line:89% align:start
 [giggles]

00:23:42.945 --> 00:23:45.480 position:10% line:89% align:start
 And play Ultimate Offering.

00:23:45.546 --> 00:23:48.017 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now for every 500
life points I give up,

00:23:48.083 --> 00:23:50.485 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can summon one
additional monster.

00:23:50.551 --> 00:23:52.887 position:24% line:83% align:start
And by sacrificing
my Toon Gemini Elf,

00:23:52.954 --> 00:23:57.556 position:7% line:83% align:start
Kaiba boy, this first monster
will be quite a powerful one.

00:23:57.624 --> 00:23:59.959 position:21% line:83% align:start
Introducing the Blue
Eyes Toon Dragon.

00:24:04.562 --> 00:24:06.498 position:33% line:83% align:start
Looks rather
vicious, doesn't he?

00:24:06.564 --> 00:24:08.700 position:21% line:83% align:start
But don't you worry
yourself, Kaiba boy.

00:24:08.767 --> 00:24:10.801 position:10% line:89% align:start
He's actually quite docile.

00:24:10.869 --> 00:24:13.871 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, compared to the
next toon that is.

00:24:13.938 --> 00:24:17.640 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ladies and gents, the
Toon Summoned Skull.

00:24:19.943 --> 00:24:21.244 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sure.

00:24:21.311 --> 00:24:23.679 position:10% line:5% align:start
I'll have to give up another
500 of my life points.

00:24:23.745 --> 00:24:26.515 position:19% line:5% align:start
But then you know what
they say, Kaiba boy.

00:24:26.581 --> 00:24:29.084 position:19% line:83% align:start
You have to spend life
points to take life points.

00:24:29.151 --> 00:24:30.718 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ha, ha, ha.

00:24:30.785 --> 00:24:32.653 position:21% line:83% align:start
Of course, you know
all about that.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.788 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yugi's been taking your
life points, for what?

00:24:34.855 --> 00:24:36.790 position:13% line:89% align:start
Going on three years now.

00:24:36.856 --> 00:24:38.925 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, I'm sorry to keep
bringing that up.

00:24:38.992 --> 00:24:41.593 position:44% line:89% align:start
 Ha!

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:45.596 position:21% line:83% align:start
I activate the magic
card Dark Core.

00:24:45.664 --> 00:24:48.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now by discarding one
card from my hand,

00:24:48.133 --> 00:24:50.802 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can remove any
monster from the game.

00:24:50.868 --> 00:24:52.070 position:7% line:89% align:start
MAX-A-MILLION PEGASUS: I see.

00:24:52.136 --> 00:24:54.771 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, then, I'm sorry
Blue Eyes Toon Dragon,

00:24:54.838 --> 00:24:56.006 position:10% line:89% align:start
but I guess this is goodbye.

00:24:56.073 --> 00:24:56.740 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [roar]

00:24:56.807 --> 00:24:58.275 position:21% line:89% align:start
 Not quite, Pegasus.

00:24:58.342 --> 00:25:01.944 position:7% line:83% align:start
You won't be getting off that
easily, because I'm discarding

00:25:02.011 --> 00:25:04.080 position:10% line:89% align:start
Y-Dragon Head from my hand.

00:25:04.146 --> 00:25:07.816 position:19% line:83% align:start
So I can remove X-Head
Cannon from the game.

00:25:07.882 --> 00:25:08.984 position:41% line:89% align:start
 What?

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:11.052 position:24% line:83% align:start
But X-Head Cannon
is your own monster.

00:25:11.119 --> 00:25:12.253 position:19% line:89% align:start
What are you scheming?

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.723 position:21% line:83% align:start
 I also activate the
magic card Soul Release.

00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:18.057 position:21% line:83% align:start
It removes one more
monster from the game,

00:25:18.125 --> 00:25:20.626 position:21% line:83% align:start
and I'm using it on
my Y-Dragon Head.

00:25:20.693 --> 00:25:22.962 position:19% line:83% align:start
 Why are you removing
your own monsters?

00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:26.631 position:24% line:83% align:start
 And now, I summon
Z-Metal Tank.

00:25:30.034 --> 00:25:31.635 position:19% line:89% align:start
 That makes no sense.

00:25:31.702 --> 00:25:32.970 position:38% line:89% align:start
Unless--

00:25:33.037 --> 00:25:36.639 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Unless I still have one
more card to play, Pegasus.

00:25:36.706 --> 00:25:38.141 position:16% line:89% align:start
And it so happens I do.

00:25:38.208 --> 00:25:41.111 position:21% line:5% align:start
Activate Return from
the Different Dimension.

00:25:41.177 --> 00:25:42.978 position:27% line:5% align:start
It's well worth
half my life points

00:25:43.045 --> 00:25:44.847 position:7% line:89% align:start
to bring back all my monsters.

00:25:44.913 --> 00:25:46.881 position:13% line:83% align:start
A nice trick to know when
you want to summon more

00:25:46.949 --> 00:25:48.850 position:10% line:89% align:start
than one monster in a turn.

00:25:48.916 --> 00:25:50.184 position:33% line:89% align:start
 [whimpers]

00:25:50.251 --> 00:25:53.653 position:13% line:83% align:start
 And as you're well aware,
these aren't just any

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.088 position:24% line:89% align:start
monsters, Pegasus.

00:25:55.155 --> 00:25:55.956 position:30% line:89% align:start
They combine.

00:26:04.196 --> 00:26:07.932 position:16% line:83% align:start
Together they create the
ultimate XYZ Dragon Cannon.

00:26:11.169 --> 00:26:12.470 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:26:12.536 --> 00:26:15.139 position:7% line:83% align:start
Now, I have all the firepower
I need to blast any card

00:26:15.205 --> 00:26:16.839 position:16% line:89% align:start
I want out of the duel.

00:26:16.906 --> 00:26:18.641 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you still say
you're going to win,

00:26:18.708 --> 00:26:20.743 position:24% line:83% align:start
then it's time to
change your tune.

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:21.477 position:44% line:89% align:start
Go.

00:26:21.543 --> 00:26:22.878 position:21% line:89% align:start
Destroy Toon World.

00:26:22.944 --> 00:26:24.112 position:44% line:89% align:start
 No.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.881 position:19% line:89% align:start
 Use Cannon Firestorm.

00:26:31.185 --> 00:26:34.088 position:33% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:26:35.822 --> 00:26:37.724 position:44% line:89% align:start
 Oh!

00:26:37.791 --> 00:26:40.026 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ugh.

00:26:40.093 --> 00:26:42.895 position:21% line:89% align:start
 That's all, folks.

00:26:42.961 --> 00:26:47.698 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now, let's see what you've
got to beat the Egyptian gods.

00:26:47.765 --> 00:26:50.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
Looks like you had two
cards up your sleeve.

00:26:50.768 --> 00:26:52.669 position:24% line:89% align:start
 What do you mean?

00:26:52.736 --> 00:26:54.137 position:35% line:89% align:start
Two cards?

00:26:54.204 --> 00:26:56.139 position:13% line:89% align:start
Kaiba, there was only one.

00:26:56.206 --> 00:26:57.941 position:33% line:89% align:start
 Yeah right.

00:26:58.008 --> 00:26:59.142 position:21% line:89% align:start
Nice try, you snake.

00:27:04.046 --> 00:27:07.182 position:10% line:83% align:start
TEA: The museum is the last
place those demented duelists

00:27:07.248 --> 00:27:08.716 position:10% line:89% align:start
would think to look for you.

00:27:08.783 --> 00:27:10.051 position:16% line:89% align:start
YUGI: Hope you're right.

00:27:10.118 --> 00:27:11.219 position:35% line:89% align:start
TEA: Hey.

00:27:11.286 --> 00:27:14.721 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's some kind of
an Egyptian exhibit.

00:27:14.788 --> 00:27:17.124 position:21% line:89% align:start
 [gasps] Look, Téa.

00:27:17.191 --> 00:27:19.826 position:16% line:89% align:start
That blue pyramid there.

00:27:19.892 --> 00:27:21.928 position:27% line:83% align:start
It looks like my
Millennium Puzzle.

00:27:21.994 --> 00:27:22.794 position:35% line:89% align:start
TEA: Yeah.

00:27:22.861 --> 00:27:23.563 position:38% line:89% align:start
It does.

00:27:23.628 --> 00:27:24.696 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let's go check it out.

00:27:32.002 --> 00:27:32.970 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ugh.

00:27:33.037 --> 00:27:34.938 position:24% line:83% align:start
YUGI: It says "The
tomb of Anubis.

00:27:35.004 --> 00:27:36.440 position:10% line:89% align:start
Egyptian Lord of the Dead."

00:27:36.507 --> 00:27:37.674 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Ugh.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.976 position:21% line:83% align:start
If we stay here, I'm
going to blow chunks.

00:27:41.043 --> 00:27:41.743 position:44% line:89% align:start
 OK.

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:42.479 position:19% line:89% align:start
I get the point, Téa.

00:27:42.545 --> 00:27:44.046 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're not a mummy fan.

00:27:54.054 --> 00:27:55.956 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hey, it's my grandfather.

00:27:56.022 --> 00:27:57.157 position:16% line:89% align:start
What are you doing here?

00:27:57.224 --> 00:28:00.460 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Oh, well, it looks like
great minds think alike.

00:28:00.527 --> 00:28:02.962 position:21% line:83% align:start
YUGI: So you came to
see that pyramid too.

00:28:03.028 --> 00:28:04.230 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Yep.

00:28:04.296 --> 00:28:06.465 position:19% line:83% align:start
 This says it's called
the Pyramid of Light.

00:28:06.532 --> 00:28:08.733 position:24% line:83% align:start
SOLOMON: In all my
years of Egyptology,

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.236 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've never come across
this relic before.

00:28:11.302 --> 00:28:13.971 position:21% line:83% align:start
But it says here it
belonged to an evil sorcerer

00:28:14.037 --> 00:28:16.473 position:16% line:83% align:start
who tried to bring about
the end of the world.

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.975 position:5% line:83% align:start
 Well, I guess it's pretty safe
to say his plan didn't

00:28:19.041 --> 00:28:20.443 position:33% line:89% align:start
work, right?

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:22.844 position:10% line:83% align:start
SOLOMON: Legends say a brave
pharaoh destroyed him using

00:28:22.911 --> 00:28:25.247 position:10% line:89% align:start
the mystical Dagger of Fate.

00:28:25.313 --> 00:28:27.715 position:27% line:83% align:start
The same pharaoh
who many believed

00:28:27.781 --> 00:28:29.984 position:30% line:83% align:start
possessed your
Millennium Puzzle.

00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:30.885 position:41% line:89% align:start
Come.

00:28:30.951 --> 00:28:32.853 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'll show you.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:33.554 position:44% line:89% align:start
See.

00:28:33.621 --> 00:28:34.721 position:24% line:89% align:start
There's the knife.

00:28:34.787 --> 00:28:35.356 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Ugh.

00:28:35.422 --> 00:28:36.557 position:30% line:89% align:start
Can we leave?

00:28:36.624 --> 00:28:38.724 position:21% line:83% align:start
 What's it say here
on his sarcophagus?

00:28:38.791 --> 00:28:39.592 position:33% line:89% align:start
 Let's see.

00:28:39.658 --> 00:28:40.893 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's some sort of prophecy.

00:28:40.959 --> 00:28:44.863 position:13% line:83% align:start
"The eye that sees what's
yet to come, its vision

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:47.865 position:24% line:83% align:start
shall be fulfilled
unless blinded

00:28:47.932 --> 00:28:51.002 position:16% line:83% align:start
by events predetermined,
thus light and shadows

00:28:51.068 --> 00:28:51.935 position:27% line:89% align:start
both be killed."

00:28:56.806 --> 00:28:58.707 position:33% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:28:59.808 --> 00:29:03.678 position:24% line:83% align:start
DISEMBODIED VOICE:
[non-english speech]

00:29:12.286 --> 00:29:15.155 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [groan]

00:29:15.222 --> 00:29:18.858 position:5% line:89% align:start
 From the light comes the dark.

00:29:18.925 --> 00:29:20.860 position:35% line:89% align:start
TEA: Yugi?

00:29:20.927 --> 00:29:23.828 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Téa, would you read me
the story about the bunny?

00:29:23.895 --> 00:29:25.931 position:19% line:83% align:start
 I'm going to pretend
that's the concussion talking

00:29:25.997 --> 00:29:27.299 position:21% line:83% align:start
and forget all about
it, because right

00:29:27.365 --> 00:29:29.166 position:7% line:89% align:start
now we've got bigger problems.

00:29:29.234 --> 00:29:31.969 position:19% line:83% align:start
Like where King Tut's
freaky cousin went.

00:29:32.036 --> 00:29:34.138 position:33% line:83% align:start
 The mummy's
body's been stolen.

00:29:34.205 --> 00:29:35.905 position:21% line:89% align:start
 And that's not all.

00:29:35.972 --> 00:29:38.174 position:30% line:83% align:start
He nabbed that
pyramid thing too.

00:29:38.241 --> 00:29:40.543 position:13% line:89% align:start
YUGI: Grandpa, stay here.

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:42.311 position:27% line:83% align:start
I have a feeling
Kaiba's in danger.

00:29:42.377 --> 00:29:43.845 position:21% line:89% align:start
I have to warn him.

00:29:43.912 --> 00:29:44.745 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Yugi.

00:29:44.812 --> 00:29:46.348 position:7% line:89% align:start
 Just keep an eye on Grandpa.

00:29:46.415 --> 00:29:47.848 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'll call you.

00:29:47.915 --> 00:29:49.817 position:19% line:89% align:start
 [grunt] What hit me?

00:29:49.884 --> 00:29:52.186 position:24% line:83% align:start
 Probably whatever
broke into the museum.

00:29:52.253 --> 00:29:52.886 position:44% line:89% align:start
 No.

00:29:52.953 --> 00:29:54.087 position:24% line:89% align:start
This is terrible.

00:29:54.154 --> 00:29:55.322 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Yeah.

00:29:55.388 --> 00:29:57.324 position:16% line:83% align:start
They took the mummy and
the Pyramid of Light.

00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:00.359 position:16% line:83% align:start
 This is one crime those
crooks are going to regret.

00:30:00.426 --> 00:30:03.195 position:16% line:83% align:start
According to the legend,
Anubis vowed that he would

00:30:03.262 --> 00:30:05.196 position:7% line:89% align:start
one day return from the dead.

00:30:05.264 --> 00:30:06.331 position:16% line:89% align:start
POLICE: What's going on?

00:30:06.397 --> 00:30:07.298 position:24% line:89% align:start
GUARD: Over here.

00:30:07.365 --> 00:30:08.199 position:35% line:89% align:start
This way.

00:30:08.266 --> 00:30:09.367 position:7% line:89% align:start
 You don't really think that.

00:30:09.434 --> 00:30:11.935 position:24% line:83% align:start
 Uh, Téa, I don't
know what to think.

00:30:12.002 --> 00:30:14.171 position:21% line:83% align:start
Let's just hope that
legend is just a legend.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.041 position:10% line:89% align:start
MOKUBA KAIBA: Stop the car.

00:30:22.311 --> 00:30:26.881 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yugi, Yugi, I've been
looking all over for you.

00:30:26.948 --> 00:30:28.316 position:24% line:83% align:start
My brother sent me
to find you, and he

00:30:28.383 --> 00:30:30.217 position:21% line:83% align:start
said that it's real
important that you bring

00:30:30.284 --> 00:30:31.885 position:13% line:89% align:start
your dual disk right away.

00:30:31.952 --> 00:30:32.586 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Wait.

00:30:32.653 --> 00:30:33.953 position:27% line:89% align:start
So he's OK then?

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.356 position:16% line:89% align:start
 I wouldn't say he's OK.

00:30:35.422 --> 00:30:37.223 position:24% line:83% align:start
All I know is that
Seto hasn't been

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:38.992 position:10% line:89% align:start
acting like himself lately.

00:30:39.058 --> 00:30:41.193 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think he's going
to totally lose it.

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.327 position:35% line:89% align:start
[groaning]

00:30:42.394 --> 00:30:44.997 position:24% line:83% align:start
 Way to hold back
that crowd, champ.

00:30:45.063 --> 00:30:46.164 position:19% line:89% align:start
 Oh, like you helped.

00:30:46.231 --> 00:30:48.099 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then again, you duel
worse than my mom.

00:30:48.165 --> 00:30:49.233 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:52.068 position:24% line:83% align:start
 You're just lucky
I'm worn out, man.

00:30:52.136 --> 00:30:52.802 position:35% line:89% align:start
BOTH: Huh?

00:30:52.869 --> 00:30:54.137 position:21% line:89% align:start
JOEY: Check it out.

00:30:54.204 --> 00:30:58.007 position:16% line:83% align:start
TRISTAN: What's Kaiba's
limo doing at Yugi's place?

00:30:58.073 --> 00:30:58.941 position:27% line:89% align:start
JOEY: Hey, Yugi.

00:30:59.008 --> 00:30:59.609 position:38% line:89% align:start
Wait up.

00:30:59.676 --> 00:31:02.311 position:41% line:89% align:start
Stop.

00:31:02.378 --> 00:31:03.911 position:19% line:89% align:start
Bro, I smell trouble.

00:31:03.978 --> 00:31:05.046 position:19% line:89% align:start
 Actually, that's me.

00:31:05.113 --> 00:31:06.314 position:24% line:89% align:start
Sorry about that.

00:31:18.692 --> 00:31:21.926 position:19% line:83% align:start
 My brother's waiting
for you on the top floor.

00:31:21.993 --> 00:31:22.428 position:35% line:89% align:start
 I got it.

00:31:22.495 --> 00:31:23.328 position:38% line:89% align:start
Thanks.

00:31:31.402 --> 00:31:35.406 position:13% line:83% align:start

Destination, Sky Top
Dueling Platform.

00:31:42.477 --> 00:31:46.415 position:16% line:89% align:start
 This is what he wants.

00:31:46.481 --> 00:31:47.815 position:24% line:83% align:start
But it's too much
of a coincidence

00:31:47.882 --> 00:31:50.418 position:13% line:83% align:start
that Kaiba would send for
us right after the vision

00:31:50.484 --> 00:31:51.619 position:19% line:89% align:start
we had at the museum.

00:31:51.686 --> 00:31:54.087 position:16% line:83% align:start
There must be something
more going on here,

00:31:54.154 --> 00:31:55.655 position:21% line:83% align:start
and I'm pretty sure
it has something

00:31:55.722 --> 00:31:56.889 position:10% line:89% align:start
to do with that Anubis guy.

00:31:56.955 --> 00:31:59.659 position:19% line:83% align:start
It seems like you had
some kind of battle

00:31:59.726 --> 00:32:02.027 position:13% line:89% align:start
with him 5,000 years ago.

00:32:02.094 --> 00:32:05.330 position:7% line:83% align:start
 Perhaps, but sadly, memories
of my days as the Pharaoh

00:32:05.396 --> 00:32:06.765 position:33% line:89% align:start
are clouded.

00:32:06.831 --> 00:32:09.933 position:13% line:83% align:start
Nor is it clear to me what
role the Egyptian God Cards

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.001 position:10% line:89% align:start
have to play in all of this.

00:32:11.068 --> 00:32:12.670 position:27% line:83% align:start
 I sure wish we
knew more about what

00:32:12.737 --> 00:32:14.104 position:10% line:89% align:start
happened back in your past.

00:32:14.171 --> 00:32:16.972 position:13% line:83% align:start
 All that matters is that
we face the future together.

00:32:17.039 --> 00:32:19.275 position:21% line:83% align:start
 And I wouldn't have
it any other way.

00:32:19.342 --> 00:32:20.376 position:16% line:89% align:start
Are you ready, partner?

00:32:20.443 --> 00:32:22.010 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Ready.

00:32:22.077 --> 00:32:22.877 position:35% line:89% align:start
 Yu-Gi-Oh!

00:32:29.517 --> 00:32:32.286 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Kaiba's car is outside,
so Yugi must be here.

00:32:32.353 --> 00:32:33.220 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Wow.

00:32:33.287 --> 00:32:34.421 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're a regular
Sherlock Holmes.

00:32:34.488 --> 00:32:36.690 position:21% line:83% align:start
Did you figure that
out all by yourself?

00:32:36.757 --> 00:32:38.324 position:24% line:83% align:start
MOKUBA KAIBA: Hey,
Yugi's upstairs.

00:32:38.391 --> 00:32:40.125 position:19% line:89% align:start
 Hey, what's going on?

00:32:40.192 --> 00:32:42.227 position:30% line:83% align:start
 My brother's
about to duel him.

00:32:42.294 --> 00:32:43.095 position:35% line:89% align:start
BOTH: Huh?

00:32:43.161 --> 00:32:43.995 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:33:12.319 --> 00:33:13.453 position:35% line:89% align:start
 Welcome.

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.489 position:10% line:89% align:start
Glad you came to duel, Yugi.

00:33:15.555 --> 00:33:18.290 position:16% line:83% align:start
Because this time things
are going to be different.

 I hope you brought
your Egyptian God Cards.

00:33:53.119 --> 00:33:56.122 position:13% line:83% align:start
Otherwise, this duel isn't
going to be any fun at all.

00:33:56.189 --> 00:33:58.257 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Kaiba, I'm sensing the
presence of something

00:33:58.323 --> 00:34:01.126 position:16% line:83% align:start
far more dangerous than
you can possibly imagine.

00:34:01.193 --> 00:34:03.094 position:13% line:89% align:start
 Spare me the fairy tales.

 I've heard enough.

00:34:06.631 --> 00:34:08.766 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you think you sense
something dangerous,

00:34:08.833 --> 00:34:10.066 position:16% line:89% align:start
you're absolutely right.

00:34:10.133 --> 00:34:11.569 position:10% line:89% align:start
Because it's me and my deck.

00:34:11.636 --> 00:34:15.137 position:5% line:83% align:start
And in this Duel Monsters match,
you're about to lose big time.

00:34:15.205 --> 00:34:17.506 position:7% line:89% align:start
Mokuba, seal all of the exits.

00:34:17.574 --> 00:34:18.474 position:27% line:89% align:start
 If you say so.

00:34:25.613 --> 00:34:26.281 position:24% line:89% align:start
 What's the deal?

00:34:26.347 --> 00:34:27.715 position:21% line:89% align:start
 We're trapped, man.

00:34:27.782 --> 00:34:30.517 position:10% line:83% align:start
 Now what do you say we get
down to business already?

00:34:30.584 --> 00:34:34.421 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Something tells me that
this duel is not a good idea.

00:34:34.488 --> 00:34:35.889 position:24% line:83% align:start
 Kaiba, why don't
you stop thinking

00:34:35.955 --> 00:34:39.425 position:10% line:83% align:start
about yourself for once and
listen to what I'm telling you?

00:34:39.492 --> 00:34:42.494 position:19% line:83% align:start
 You're in no position
to be making demands.

00:34:42.561 --> 00:34:45.530 position:21% line:89% align:start
So shut up and duel.

00:34:45.597 --> 00:34:49.433 position:7% line:89% align:start
And may the best duelist win.

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:52.168 position:19% line:83% align:start
 I guess Yugi's going
through with this.

00:34:52.235 --> 00:34:55.605 position:21% line:83% align:start
 Kaiba ain't leaving
him much choice.

00:34:55.672 --> 00:34:58.040 position:30% line:83% align:start
 All Duel Dome
exits are now secure.

00:34:58.106 --> 00:34:59.809 position:5% line:89% align:start
All dueling systems are online.

00:34:59.876 --> 00:35:02.177 position:21% line:83% align:start
 You've been taking
credit for being the best

00:35:02.244 --> 00:35:03.412 position:13% line:89% align:start
duelist for way too long.

00:35:03.479 --> 00:35:06.080 position:21% line:83% align:start
And to tell you the
truth, I'm sick of it.

00:35:06.147 --> 00:35:08.549 position:16% line:83% align:start
By the time this duel is
over, you'll be exposed

00:35:08.616 --> 00:35:10.451 position:7% line:89% align:start
to the world as a total fraud.

00:35:10.518 --> 00:35:14.054 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.054 position:24% line:89% align:start
BOTH: Let's duel.

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:15.589 position:33% line:89% align:start
 I'll start.

00:35:21.293 --> 00:35:25.396 position:19% line:83% align:start
 First, I'll summon my
Familiar Knight in defense mode.

00:35:25.463 --> 00:35:27.197 position:19% line:89% align:start
Try and get past him.

00:35:27.265 --> 00:35:28.198 position:33% line:89% align:start
 Very well.

00:35:28.265 --> 00:35:29.066 position:38% line:89% align:start
I shall.

00:35:34.136 --> 00:35:35.071 position:19% line:89% align:start
I play Queen's Knight.

00:35:38.207 --> 00:35:41.510 position:21% line:83% align:start
And now, say goodbye
to your monster.

00:35:41.576 --> 00:35:43.178 position:16% line:89% align:start
Queen's Knight, attack!

00:35:47.481 --> 00:35:49.083 position:33% line:89% align:start
[shattering]

00:35:50.417 --> 00:35:53.219 position:24% line:83% align:start
By destroying your
knight I've activated

00:35:53.286 --> 00:35:55.622 position:21% line:83% align:start
its special ability,
which allows you to play

00:35:55.688 --> 00:35:57.490 position:13% line:89% align:start
a new beast in its place.

00:35:57.557 --> 00:35:58.357 position:41% line:89% align:start
 What?

00:35:58.423 --> 00:35:59.424 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yugi's lost it.

00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:01.293 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why would he let
Kaiba play a monster

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.395 position:13% line:89% align:start
with 2,400 attack points?

00:36:03.462 --> 00:36:04.730 position:30% line:89% align:start
 He did what?

00:36:04.796 --> 00:36:08.499 position:10% line:83% align:start
SETO KAIBA: And you're being
so helpful, because why?

00:36:08.566 --> 00:36:12.536 position:10% line:83% align:start
 Because by doing so I also
get to summon a new monster.

00:36:12.602 --> 00:36:13.436 position:30% line:89% align:start
King's Knight.

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:19.108 position:30% line:83% align:start
When these two
knights are in play,

00:36:19.174 --> 00:36:21.544 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can automatically
summon my Jack's Knight.

00:36:24.679 --> 00:36:28.650 position:21% line:83% align:start
And next, I'll place
one card face down.

00:36:28.716 --> 00:36:31.218 position:27% line:89% align:start
Make your move.

00:36:31.285 --> 00:36:33.052 position:24% line:83% align:start
DISEMBODIED VOICE:
[non-english speech]

00:36:34.621 --> 00:36:37.557 position:27% line:83% align:start
 Looks like your
luck's finally run out.

00:36:37.623 --> 00:36:39.659 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll keep this card
face down on the field

00:36:39.725 --> 00:36:41.259 position:13% line:89% align:start
until the time is right--

00:36:41.326 --> 00:36:42.594 position:19% line:89% align:start
right for me that is.

00:36:42.661 --> 00:36:45.397 position:16% line:83% align:start
And then nothing in your
deck will make a difference.

00:36:45.463 --> 00:36:47.498 position:27% line:89% align:start
Your move, Yugi.

00:36:47.565 --> 00:36:49.133 position:24% line:89% align:start
[electric crackle]

00:36:54.337 --> 00:36:57.907 position:19% line:89% align:start
 An Egyptian God Card.

00:36:57.974 --> 00:37:00.309 position:27% line:83% align:start
 I sacrifice my
three knights to bring

00:37:00.375 --> 00:37:02.044 position:10% line:89% align:start
forth my ultimate creature.

00:37:04.746 --> 00:37:10.483 position:16% line:83% align:start
Behold, the Egyptian God
Card, Slifer the Sky Dragon.

00:37:20.659 --> 00:37:21.927 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [roars]

00:37:21.994 --> 00:37:24.429 position:10% line:83% align:start
 Your monster is completely
defenseless against

00:37:24.495 --> 00:37:26.364 position:10% line:89% align:start
the divine power of Slifer.

00:37:26.431 --> 00:37:28.432 position:10% line:89% align:start
Now, my sky dragon, attack!

00:37:33.003 --> 00:37:34.705 position:35% line:89% align:start
 [grunts]

00:37:37.006 --> 00:37:37.640 position:33% line:89% align:start
 Had enough?

00:37:40.408 --> 00:37:43.378 position:24% line:83% align:start
 Not only am I not
afraid of your God Cards,

00:37:43.445 --> 00:37:46.180 position:13% line:83% align:start
but I'm going to force you
to summon all three of them

00:37:46.246 --> 00:37:48.616 position:38% line:89% align:start
at once.

00:37:48.682 --> 00:37:51.384 position:16% line:83% align:start
Thanks to my Obligatory
Summon Magic Card,

00:37:51.452 --> 00:37:53.586 position:19% line:83% align:start
you have to bring out
every monster in your deck

00:37:53.653 --> 00:37:55.722 position:21% line:83% align:start
that falls into the
same category as the one

00:37:55.788 --> 00:37:57.322 position:10% line:89% align:start
that's on the field already.

00:37:57.389 --> 00:37:58.523 position:33% line:89% align:start
 Very well.

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:01.326 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then I play two more
Egyptian God Cards--

00:38:01.393 --> 00:38:04.528 position:13% line:83% align:start
Obelisk the Tormentor and
the Winged Dragon of Ra.

00:38:07.465 --> 00:38:08.733 position:35% line:89% align:start

 [grunts]

00:38:26.648 --> 00:38:28.983 position:21% line:83% align:start
You've allowed me to
assemble the three strongest

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:31.351 position:13% line:83% align:start
and most feared creatures
in Duel Monsters,

00:38:31.418 --> 00:38:34.487 position:13% line:89% align:start
Kaiba, a foolish mistake.

00:38:34.553 --> 00:38:37.723 position:7% line:89% align:start
 [chuckling] It's no mistake.

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:41.626 position:7% line:83% align:start
My entire strategy was to draw
out your three Egyptian God

00:38:41.693 --> 00:38:45.497 position:10% line:83% align:start
Cards, so I can be the first
duelist to crush all of them

00:38:45.563 --> 00:38:46.664 position:38% line:89% align:start
at once.

00:38:46.731 --> 00:38:49.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
 And just how do you
intend to do that?

00:38:49.466 --> 00:38:51.502 position:27% line:83% align:start
 You're about to
find out right now.

00:38:51.568 --> 00:38:56.639 position:24% line:83% align:start
Reveal Trap Card,
Pyramid of Light.

00:38:56.706 --> 00:38:58.640 position:21% line:83% align:start
YUGI: So the Pyramid
of Light is more

00:38:58.707 --> 00:39:01.343 position:7% line:89% align:start
than just an ancient artifact.

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:04.512 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's also a card.

00:39:04.578 --> 00:39:06.380 position:16% line:89% align:start
 Now, Pyramid, activate.

00:39:11.418 --> 00:39:15.320 position:19% line:89% align:start

SETO KAIBA: Looks like your
so-called unstoppable monsters

00:39:38.607 --> 00:39:39.775 position:24% line:89% align:start
have been stopped.

00:39:39.842 --> 00:39:41.676 position:24% line:89% align:start
YUGI: Impossible.

00:39:41.743 --> 00:39:42.510 position:24% line:89% align:start
 See for yourself.

00:39:45.512 --> 00:39:46.346 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Whoa.

00:39:46.413 --> 00:39:48.615 position:30% line:89% align:start
Check it out.

00:39:55.488 --> 00:39:56.321 position:35% line:89% align:start
 But how?

Not more freaky magic.

happens when Yugi duels.

Hey, what are you looking at?

00:40:25.446 --> 00:40:28.582 position:16% line:89% align:start
 I think you got it mad.

That blue beam is the
same color as the Pyramid

This place looks

I've got to find him,
so we can reconnect.

00:42:01.626 --> 00:42:04.595 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm pretty sure that one of
these rooms belongs to him.

00:42:04.662 --> 00:42:06.397 position:16% line:89% align:start
Question is, which one?

00:42:06.463 --> 00:42:08.766 position:16% line:83% align:start
There must be a million
doorways in this place.

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:15.671 position:24% line:89% align:start
 [groan] Oh, man.

00:42:15.737 --> 00:42:19.408 position:5% line:89% align:start
I feel as bad as you look, Joey.

00:42:19.474 --> 00:42:20.642 position:41% line:89% align:start
 What?

00:42:20.709 --> 00:42:23.411 position:19% line:83% align:start
Tristan, I don't think
we're in Kansas anymore.

00:42:23.477 --> 00:42:25.513 position:5% line:89% align:start
 It looks like some weird maze.

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:28.949 position:21% line:83% align:start
And man, I think you
and I are the lab rats.

00:42:29.016 --> 00:42:30.617 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Hello?

00:42:30.684 --> 00:42:32.586 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hello?

00:42:32.652 --> 00:42:34.553 position:38% line:89% align:start
Pharaoh?

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:37.890 position:19% line:89% align:start
Pharaoh, are you here?

00:42:37.957 --> 00:42:38.757 position:38% line:89% align:start
Pharaoh?

00:42:42.493 --> 00:42:43.862 position:38% line:89% align:start
Nothing.

00:42:43.928 --> 00:42:44.762 position:38% line:89% align:start
Pharaoh!

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.701 position:27% line:89% align:start
 You hear that?

00:42:50.767 --> 00:42:51.467 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Yeah.

00:42:51.534 --> 00:42:52.501 position:19% line:89% align:start
It sounded like Yugi.

00:42:52.568 --> 00:42:53.369 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on.

00:43:04.045 --> 00:43:05.479 position:19% line:89% align:start
 It hurts, doesn't it?

00:43:05.546 --> 00:43:08.983 position:7% line:83% align:start
When you put your faith in the
gods, and they let you down.

00:43:09.049 --> 00:43:12.819 position:10% line:83% align:start
If I were you, now's a good
time to start praying for mercy.

00:43:12.886 --> 00:43:15.021 position:13% line:83% align:start
Because from here on out,
I'm planning to take you

00:43:15.088 --> 00:43:17.456 position:7% line:89% align:start
apart piece by painful piece.

00:43:17.522 --> 00:43:20.859 position:10% line:83% align:start
So let the torture continue
with this, the torrential magic

00:43:20.926 --> 00:43:22.460 position:13% line:89% align:start
of Mystical Space Typhoon.

00:43:22.526 --> 00:43:23.494 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Ugh.

00:43:23.561 --> 00:43:26.764 position:27% line:83% align:start
 Your face down
card is destroyed.

00:43:26.831 --> 00:43:29.633 position:13% line:83% align:start
And if you like that, then
you're going to love this.

00:43:29.699 --> 00:43:31.001 position:19% line:89% align:start
Peten the Dark Clown.

00:43:31.067 --> 00:43:32.068 position:33% line:89% align:start
 [chuckles]

00:43:32.135 --> 00:43:34.237 position:30% line:83% align:start
 But don't let
his name fool you.

00:43:34.304 --> 00:43:35.638 position:16% line:89% align:start
He's no laughing matter.

00:43:38.539 --> 00:43:42.710 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now, attack with
Bloodlust Slash.

00:43:42.777 --> 00:43:44.679 position:35% line:89% align:start
 [screams]

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:53.786 position:7% line:83% align:start
 And to top it off, I'll place
this face down on the field.

00:43:53.853 --> 00:43:57.489 position:27% line:83% align:start
 That attack, it
drained me some.

00:43:57.555 --> 00:43:59.557 position:13% line:89% align:start
But I'm far from finished.

00:43:59.624 --> 00:44:02.526 position:13% line:89% align:start
Magician Valkyria, attack!

00:44:02.593 --> 00:44:04.929 position:19% line:89% align:start
Mystic Sceptre Blast!

00:44:04.995 --> 00:44:05.829 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Ugh.

00:44:08.832 --> 00:44:09.799 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [grunt]

00:44:14.137 --> 00:44:15.570 position:27% line:89% align:start
Nice try, Yugi.

00:44:15.637 --> 00:44:18.774 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I knew you'd make that move,
which is why my face down card

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.609 position:13% line:89% align:start
is Deck Destruction Virus.

00:44:21.676 --> 00:44:22.777 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [grunt]

00:44:22.843 --> 00:44:24.512 position:24% line:83% align:start
 You set off this
crippling trap when

00:44:24.578 --> 00:44:25.980 position:10% line:89% align:start
you destroyed my dark clown.

00:44:26.047 --> 00:44:29.049 position:10% line:83% align:start
And now its viral tentacles
will infect 10 random cards

00:44:29.116 --> 00:44:32.852 position:7% line:83% align:start
from your deck, and then send
them straight to the graveyard.

00:44:32.919 --> 00:44:33.886 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Oh no.

00:44:33.954 --> 00:44:35.120 position:30% line:89% align:start
 Oh yes, Yugi.

00:44:35.188 --> 00:44:38.489 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now, say goodbye to
25% of your duel deck.

00:44:45.964 --> 00:44:47.130 position:44% line:89% align:start
 No.

00:44:47.198 --> 00:44:50.533 position:16% line:83% align:start
 I hate to be the bearer
of even more bad news.

00:44:50.599 --> 00:44:52.935 position:19% line:83% align:start
But when you destroyed
my Peten the Dark Clown,

00:44:53.002 --> 00:44:54.937 position:24% line:83% align:start
you activated his
special ability,

00:44:55.004 --> 00:44:59.040 position:7% line:83% align:start
allowing me to summon another
dark clown to take his place.

00:44:59.107 --> 00:45:01.710 position:33% line:89% align:start
 Ha, ha, ha.

00:45:01.776 --> 00:45:04.012 position:24% line:89% align:start
[blows raspberry]

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:13.720 position:16% line:89% align:start
 I summon Des Feral Imp.

00:45:13.786 --> 00:45:17.122 position:10% line:83% align:start
And next, I'll activate the
magic of Card of Demise.

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:19.891 position:21% line:83% align:start
It lets me draw five
new cards from my deck.

00:45:19.958 --> 00:45:21.959 position:24% line:83% align:start
But if I don't use
them in five turns,

00:45:22.027 --> 00:45:24.095 position:13% line:89% align:start
I lose them in five turns.

00:45:24.161 --> 00:45:26.964 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now, I'll sacrifice my
Feral Imp and activate

00:45:27.031 --> 00:45:29.833 position:21% line:89% align:start
White Dragon Ritual.

00:45:29.899 --> 00:45:31.935 position:24% line:83% align:start
To summon Paladin
of White Dragon.

00:45:32.002 --> 00:45:33.136 position:35% line:89% align:start
 [shrieks]

00:45:33.203 --> 00:45:36.605 position:19% line:83% align:start
 Paladin, attack with
Ionic Spear Burst.

00:45:48.115 --> 00:45:50.716 position:5% line:83% align:start
YUGI (VOICEOVER): It's as though
when I lose my life points,

00:45:50.783 --> 00:45:54.086 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm losing my
actual life energy.

00:45:54.153 --> 00:45:58.157 position:24% line:83% align:start
 And now, I summon
Blue Eyes White Dragon.

00:45:58.224 --> 00:45:59.758 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [roars]

00:45:59.824 --> 00:46:01.760 position:24% line:89% align:start
 Take a good look.

00:46:01.826 --> 00:46:04.728 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's the monster that's been the
bane of your dueling existence

00:46:04.795 --> 00:46:06.597 position:10% line:89% align:start
ever since our first match.

00:46:06.663 --> 00:46:10.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
And now he's back,
but he's not alone.

00:46:10.833 --> 00:46:11.934 position:24% line:89% align:start
Any last requests?

00:46:20.708 --> 00:46:22.377 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Huh?

00:46:22.444 --> 00:46:23.811 position:33% line:89% align:start
There he is.

00:46:23.878 --> 00:46:24.678 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, Pharaoh!

00:46:27.448 --> 00:46:28.082 position:30% line:89% align:start
Where'd he go?

00:46:31.017 --> 00:46:31.918 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:46:33.886 --> 00:46:37.622 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, hold on.

00:46:37.689 --> 00:46:38.689 position:21% line:89% align:start
This isn't his room.

00:46:46.997 --> 00:46:48.398 position:38% line:89% align:start
Pharaoh!

00:46:48.465 --> 00:46:49.900 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh no!

00:46:49.966 --> 00:46:52.835 position:35% line:89% align:start
[cackling]

00:46:52.902 --> 00:46:54.003 position:30% line:89% align:start
 Who's there?

00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:56.838 position:24% line:83% align:start
DISEMBODIED VOICE:
[non-english speech]

00:47:02.477 --> 00:47:03.545 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [gasps]

00:47:06.914 --> 00:47:10.150 position:33% line:89% align:start
 [grumbling]

00:47:10.217 --> 00:47:11.818 position:35% line:89% align:start
 [shouts]

00:47:18.123 --> 00:47:20.724 position:33% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:47:21.792 --> 00:47:22.693 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Yugi!

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:23.661 position:33% line:89% align:start
You in here?

00:47:23.727 --> 00:47:25.963 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Yugi!

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:28.199 position:33% line:89% align:start
 [screaming]

00:47:28.265 --> 00:47:29.933 position:35% line:89% align:start
BOTH: Hi.

00:47:29.999 --> 00:47:30.800 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:47:30.867 --> 00:47:31.935 position:33% line:89% align:start
 Talk later.

00:47:32.001 --> 00:47:33.069 position:38% line:89% align:start
Run now!

00:47:33.136 --> 00:47:35.204 position:24% line:89% align:start
 What's with him?

00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:37.039 position:33% line:89% align:start
[grumbling]

00:47:37.106 --> 00:47:38.140 position:24% line:89% align:start
BOTH: [whimpering]

00:47:38.207 --> 00:47:39.007 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Zoinks!

00:47:45.012 --> 00:47:46.113 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Whoa.

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:47.114 position:27% line:83% align:start
It looks like an
earthquake hit this place.

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:52.785 position:27% line:83% align:start
And what in the
world is that thing?

00:47:52.852 --> 00:47:54.854 position:21% line:83% align:start
MOKUBA KAIBA: That's
what I want to know.

00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:57.956 position:27% line:83% align:start
 Mokuba, is Yugi
inside that thing?

00:47:58.022 --> 00:48:00.458 position:21% line:83% align:start
 He's in there, and
so is my brother.

00:48:00.525 --> 00:48:04.262 position:21% line:89% align:start
[sighs] What is it?

00:48:04.329 --> 00:48:05.662 position:30% line:89% align:start
 I don't know.

00:48:05.729 --> 00:48:08.898 position:13% line:83% align:start
 Looks like that artifact
we saw back at the museum.

00:48:08.965 --> 00:48:10.833 position:10% line:89% align:start
Only this one's supersized.

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:12.969 position:19% line:83% align:start
 But how is something
like that possible?

00:48:13.035 --> 00:48:13.970 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Anubis.

00:48:14.036 --> 00:48:14.836 position:24% line:89% align:start
 You don't think--

00:48:14.903 --> 00:48:17.105 position:5% line:89% align:start
 Don't you remember the legend?

00:48:17.172 --> 00:48:18.173 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [gasp]

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:20.108 position:21% line:83% align:start
SOLOMON: Anubis once
tried to destroy

00:48:20.175 --> 00:48:23.244 position:13% line:83% align:start
the world using the power
of the Pyramid of Light.

00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:24.278 position:19% line:89% align:start
 The Pyramid of Light?

00:48:24.345 --> 00:48:24.912 position:41% line:89% align:start
Wait.

00:48:24.979 --> 00:48:26.846 position:30% line:89% align:start
Rewind a sec.

00:48:26.913 --> 00:48:28.748 position:21% line:83% align:start
All of this insanity
started when

00:48:28.815 --> 00:48:30.216 position:24% line:83% align:start
my brother played
a card that was

00:48:30.283 --> 00:48:31.451 position:10% line:89% align:start
called the Pyramid of Light.

00:48:31.518 --> 00:48:34.086 position:19% line:83% align:start
 Well, Yugi and Kaiba
are inside something

00:48:34.153 --> 00:48:36.121 position:19% line:89% align:start
from 5,000 years ago.

00:48:36.188 --> 00:48:39.724 position:7% line:83% align:start
And if the myth is true, then
Anubis is using it to finish

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:41.092 position:10% line:89% align:start
what he started in the past.

00:48:41.159 --> 00:48:42.994 position:27% line:89% align:start
 This is crazy.

00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:46.497 position:27% line:83% align:start
We've got to get
them out of there.

00:48:46.564 --> 00:48:49.266 position:16% line:83% align:start
 I don't know what dark
powers are at work here,

00:48:49.332 --> 00:48:51.501 position:27% line:83% align:start
but I can't let
them go unchecked.

00:48:51.568 --> 00:48:55.504 position:5% line:83% align:start
I play Premature Burial to raise
Valkyria from the graveyard.

00:48:55.571 --> 00:48:58.139 position:24% line:83% align:start
And I'll boost her
strength with Mage Power.

00:48:58.206 --> 00:49:00.742 position:35% line:89% align:start
[beeping]

00:49:00.808 --> 00:49:07.713 position:16% line:83% align:start
It may cost me 800 life
points, but my Valkyria now

00:49:08.881 --> 00:49:11.317 position:21% line:83% align:start
gains 500 attack and
defense points every time

00:49:11.384 --> 00:49:14.886 position:10% line:89% align:start
I play a magic or trap car.

00:49:14.953 --> 00:49:15.854 position:27% line:89% align:start
Like these two.

00:49:19.891 --> 00:49:23.827 position:7% line:83% align:start
1,000 additional attack points
make my Valkyria more than

00:49:23.894 --> 00:49:25.795 position:10% line:89% align:start
a match for your Blue Eyes.

00:49:25.862 --> 00:49:28.831 position:19% line:83% align:start
Attack, Valkyria, with
Mystic Sceptre Blast!

00:49:32.068 --> 00:49:34.102 position:21% line:89% align:start
 Not so fast, Yugi.

00:49:34.169 --> 00:49:37.705 position:19% line:83% align:start
Attack Guidance Armor
will save my Blue Eyes.

00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:43.010 position:33% line:89% align:start
 Ah, a trap.

00:49:43.077 --> 00:49:43.911 position:10% line:89% align:start
SETO KAIBA: Very observant.

00:49:43.978 --> 00:49:45.712 position:7% line:89% align:start
Now, your attack is diverted.

00:49:48.882 --> 00:49:51.551 position:7% line:83% align:start
And since my Deck Destruction
Virus is still in play,

00:49:51.618 --> 00:49:53.752 position:24% line:83% align:start
it infects 10 more
cards in your deck.

00:49:59.123 --> 00:50:00.725 position:35% line:89% align:start
 [scream]

00:50:02.393 --> 00:50:05.963 position:21% line:83% align:start
 I've lost half the
cards in my deck already.

00:50:06.029 --> 00:50:07.164 position:10% line:89% align:start
 Soon you'll lose them all.

00:50:07.231 --> 00:50:09.233 position:19% line:83% align:start
But first, I'll bring
back an old friend

00:50:09.299 --> 00:50:10.833 position:7% line:89% align:start
who just hates to say goodbye.

00:50:13.369 --> 00:50:15.904 position:35% line:89% align:start
 [giggle]

00:50:15.971 --> 00:50:20.342 position:13% line:83% align:start
SETO KAIBA: And next, huh,
I'm going to summon up

00:50:20.408 --> 00:50:22.577 position:19% line:83% align:start
your worst nightmare,
because if you

00:50:22.644 --> 00:50:24.345 position:5% line:89% align:start
couldn't defeat one Blue Eyes--

00:50:24.411 --> 00:50:25.512 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [grunt]

00:50:25.579 --> 00:50:29.816 position:24% line:83% align:start
 --there's no way
you'll defeat three,

00:50:29.882 --> 00:50:35.954 position:10% line:83% align:start
especially when combined as
the Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon.

00:50:36.021 --> 00:50:39.156 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you think he's scary now,
just wait till he attacks.

00:50:39.224 --> 00:50:41.158 position:21% line:89% align:start
In fact, don't wait.

00:50:41.225 --> 00:50:44.061 position:24% line:83% align:start
Blue Eyes Ultimate
Dragon, Neutron Blast.

00:50:49.399 --> 00:50:50.300 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [gasp]

00:50:52.034 --> 00:50:53.969 position:33% line:89% align:start
 [grunting]

00:50:54.036 --> 00:50:56.238 position:35% line:89% align:start
[beeping]

00:50:56.305 --> 00:50:59.207 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:50:59.274 --> 00:51:02.243 position:16% line:83% align:start
SETO KAIBA: Look at the
world's best duelist now.

00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:02.943 position:33% line:89% align:start
 [whimpers]

00:51:05.979 --> 00:51:07.247 position:19% line:89% align:start
 I think we lost them.

00:51:07.314 --> 00:51:09.616 position:10% line:89% align:start
 So what were those freaks?

00:51:09.683 --> 00:51:12.351 position:7% line:89% align:start
DISEMBODIED VOICE: [cackling]

00:51:12.418 --> 00:51:14.986 position:27% line:83% align:start
 Yugi, what the
heck is going on?

00:51:15.053 --> 00:51:17.122 position:19% line:83% align:start
 We've been drawn into
the Millennium Puzzle.

00:51:17.188 --> 00:51:20.125 position:16% line:83% align:start
And that thing up there
is somehow responsible.

00:51:20.191 --> 00:51:23.093 position:7% line:89% align:start
 Then what's that down there?

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:25.262 position:21% line:83% align:start
 That blue one looks
like the Pyramid of Light

00:51:25.329 --> 00:51:26.929 position:21% line:89% align:start
I saw at the museum.

00:51:26.996 --> 00:51:28.164 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Yeah.

00:51:28.231 --> 00:51:29.065 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, it looks like
it's beating the crud

00:51:29.132 --> 00:51:30.333 position:7% line:89% align:start
out of your Millennium Puzzle.

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:34.069 position:19% line:83% align:start
 Fighting pyramids and
creepy floating eyes.

00:51:34.136 --> 00:51:34.936 position:35% line:89% align:start
Wonderful.

00:51:35.003 --> 00:51:36.104 position:33% line:89% align:start
 It's crazy.

00:51:36.171 --> 00:51:37.905 position:21% line:83% align:start
 Hey, when you hang
around with Yugi,

00:51:37.972 --> 00:51:39.308 position:10% line:89% align:start
this is par for the course.

00:51:39.374 --> 00:51:42.376 position:24% line:83% align:start
 So any idea what
we're up against?

00:51:42.443 --> 00:51:45.045 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Maybe.

00:51:45.111 --> 00:51:49.015 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think this all has to do with
an ancient Egyptian sorcerer.

00:51:49.082 --> 00:51:51.284 position:21% line:83% align:start
 I knew it was going
to be something insane.

00:51:51.351 --> 00:51:54.286 position:16% line:83% align:start
 He's called Anubis the
Egyptian Lord of the Dead.

00:51:54.353 --> 00:51:55.321 position:24% line:89% align:start
 Lord of the Dead?

00:51:55.387 --> 00:51:56.555 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Yeah.

00:51:56.622 --> 00:51:58.990 position:16% line:83% align:start
Centuries ago, he tried
to destroy the world,

00:51:59.057 --> 00:52:01.459 position:10% line:83% align:start
and I'm starting to believe
he's trying to make a comeback.

00:52:01.526 --> 00:52:02.760 position:33% line:89% align:start
BOTH: What?

00:52:02.826 --> 00:52:06.229 position:13% line:83% align:start
 "The eye that sees what's
yet to come, its vision

00:52:06.296 --> 00:52:08.964 position:24% line:83% align:start
shall be fulfilled
unless blinded

00:52:09.031 --> 00:52:12.301 position:16% line:83% align:start
by events predetermined,
thus light and shadows

00:52:12.368 --> 00:52:13.402 position:27% line:89% align:start
both be killed."

00:52:17.138 --> 00:52:19.307 position:13% line:83% align:start
TRISTAN: Doesn't look like
the duel's going too well

00:52:19.374 --> 00:52:21.008 position:10% line:83% align:start
for your friend the Pharaoh.
- Yeah.

00:52:21.075 --> 00:52:23.043 position:27% line:83% align:start
We've got to do
something to help him.

00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:24.345 position:21% line:83% align:start
And all I can think
of right now is

00:52:24.411 --> 00:52:26.045 position:7% line:89% align:start
to head back to Anubis' tomb.

00:52:26.113 --> 00:52:27.146 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Uhh.

00:52:27.213 --> 00:52:28.948 position:30% line:83% align:start
You mean back
towards the mummies?

00:52:29.015 --> 00:52:29.982 position:30% line:89% align:start
 Hey, come on.

00:52:30.049 --> 00:52:32.084 position:24% line:83% align:start
We already know we
can outrun them.

00:52:32.151 --> 00:52:34.953 position:44% line:89% align:start
 Oi.

00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:37.888 position:24% line:83% align:start
DISEMBODIED VOICE:
[non-english speech]

00:52:40.257 --> 00:52:43.194 position:35% line:89% align:start
[cackling]

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:44.695 position:21% line:89% align:start
 Does it hurt, Yugi.

00:52:44.762 --> 00:52:47.997 position:21% line:83% align:start
Because it only gets
worse from here.

00:52:48.064 --> 00:52:50.099 position:27% line:83% align:start
 Kaiba, we can't
continue this duel.

00:52:50.166 --> 00:52:52.134 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's another
power at work here,

00:52:52.201 --> 00:52:54.069 position:10% line:89% align:start
and it's destroying us both.

00:52:54.136 --> 00:52:55.237 position:13% line:89% align:start
 That's getting a bit old.

00:52:55.304 --> 00:52:56.705 position:44% line:89% align:start
 No.

00:52:56.772 --> 00:52:59.340 position:13% line:83% align:start
That Pyramid of Light has
created a deadly shadow game.

00:52:59.407 --> 00:53:00.975 position:21% line:89% align:start
I know you sense it.

00:53:01.042 --> 00:53:02.710 position:24% line:89% align:start
We must stop now.

00:53:02.777 --> 00:53:05.979 position:13% line:83% align:start
 The only thing I sense is
your fear, not that I blame you.

00:53:06.046 --> 00:53:09.315 position:10% line:83% align:start
But I came here to win, and
stopping is not an option.

00:53:09.383 --> 00:53:12.218 position:19% line:83% align:start
For all the times you
humiliated me in a duel

00:53:12.284 --> 00:53:14.487 position:19% line:83% align:start
when clearly I should
have been champion.

00:53:14.553 --> 00:53:17.122 position:16% line:83% align:start
For all the times I had
to listen to you preach

00:53:17.188 --> 00:53:19.424 position:7% line:89% align:start
about the heart of the cards.

00:53:19.491 --> 00:53:20.859 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're going down, Yugi.

00:53:20.924 --> 00:53:25.129 position:5% line:83% align:start
And my Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon
is going to put you there.

00:53:25.195 --> 00:53:28.498 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Kaiba, once again, your
ridiculously overinflated ego

00:53:28.564 --> 00:53:30.433 position:16% line:89% align:start
blinds you to the truth.

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:33.034 position:19% line:89% align:start
I am far from beaten.

00:53:33.101 --> 00:53:39.373 position:16% line:83% align:start
I play Monster Reborn to
bring back Dark Magician Girl.

00:53:39.441 --> 00:53:40.274 position:44% line:89% align:start
 Hm.

00:53:45.446 --> 00:53:48.114 position:24% line:83% align:start
Next, I reveal my
face down card.

00:53:48.181 --> 00:53:50.048 position:30% line:89% align:start
Sage's Stone.

00:53:50.115 --> 00:53:51.551 position:19% line:5% align:start
When the Dark Magician
Girl is on the field

00:53:51.618 --> 00:53:55.354 position:10% line:5% align:start
and Sage's Stone is played,
it allows me to automatically

00:53:55.421 --> 00:53:56.988 position:19% line:89% align:start
summon Dark Magician.

00:53:57.054 --> 00:53:59.357 position:44% line:89% align:start
 Ah.

00:53:59.424 --> 00:54:00.191 position:35% line:89% align:start
 Big deal.

00:54:00.258 --> 00:54:02.993 position:13% line:89% align:start
 Oh, it's a very big deal.

00:54:03.059 --> 00:54:06.530 position:21% line:83% align:start
For now I sacrifice
both magicians to summon

00:54:06.596 --> 00:54:09.265 position:10% line:89% align:start
the Sorcerer of Dark Magic.

00:54:09.331 --> 00:54:10.533 position:24% line:89% align:start
[electric crackle]

00:54:12.535 --> 00:54:17.205 position:5% line:83% align:start
And with his rise to power comes
your Blue Eyes fall from grace.

00:54:17.272 --> 00:54:20.007 position:10% line:83% align:start
Because for every one of my
Sorcerer's fallen comrades

00:54:20.073 --> 00:54:23.277 position:19% line:83% align:start
in the graveyard, your
dragon loses 500 points.

00:54:23.343 --> 00:54:24.378 position:44% line:89% align:start
 Ah.

00:54:24.445 --> 00:54:27.079 position:27% line:83% align:start
 And right now,
there have been three

00:54:27.146 --> 00:54:29.282 position:10% line:89% align:start
magicians laid down to rest.

00:54:29.348 --> 00:54:32.518 position:27% line:83% align:start
So your precious
Ultimate Dragon's power

00:54:32.585 --> 00:54:35.387 position:13% line:89% align:start
decreases by 1,500 points.

00:54:35.454 --> 00:54:36.254 position:35% line:89% align:start
[beeping]

00:54:37.622 --> 00:54:39.290 position:24% line:83% align:start
 But that means my
Blue Eyes Ultimate

00:54:39.356 --> 00:54:41.325 position:5% line:89% align:start
Dragon is vulnerable to attack.

00:54:41.392 --> 00:54:43.594 position:7% line:89% align:start
 That's exactly what it means.

00:54:43.661 --> 00:54:46.229 position:10% line:89% align:start
Attack with Celestial Blast.

00:54:51.166 --> 00:54:54.036 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Ugh.

00:54:54.102 --> 00:54:55.537 position:35% line:89% align:start
[beeping]

00:54:55.604 --> 00:54:58.439 position:30% line:83% align:start
 Now, will you
stop this madness?

00:54:58.506 --> 00:55:00.241 position:19% line:89% align:start
 After one lucky move?

00:55:00.308 --> 00:55:01.509 position:24% line:89% align:start
I don't think so.

00:55:01.576 --> 00:55:03.043 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Ugh.

00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:04.077 position:24% line:89% align:start
Very well, Kaiba.

00:55:04.144 --> 00:55:05.445 position:16% line:89% align:start
You leave me no choice.

00:55:05.512 --> 00:55:08.315 position:27% line:83% align:start
I move to attack
Peten the Dark Clown.

00:55:08.381 --> 00:55:09.783 position:44% line:89% align:start
 No.

00:55:09.850 --> 00:55:13.319 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'll have no monsters on the
field to defend my life points.

00:55:13.385 --> 00:55:16.521 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sorcerer, Celestial
Blast Attack!

00:55:20.123 --> 00:55:21.124 position:35% line:89% align:start
 [screams]

00:55:22.226 --> 00:55:23.393 position:30% line:83% align:start
 You may have
destroyed my clown,

00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:27.230 position:16% line:83% align:start
but you forgot about my
deck virus trap card--

00:55:27.296 --> 00:55:30.533 position:19% line:83% align:start
and at a time when you
couldn't afford to.

00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:32.535 position:24% line:83% align:start
Your deck is about
to be wiped out.

00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:35.938 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?

00:55:36.004 --> 00:55:37.405 position:30% line:89% align:start
 Sorry, Kaiba.

00:55:37.472 --> 00:55:40.508 position:5% line:83% align:start
But my Sorcerer of Dark Magic's
mystic powers are so mighty,

00:55:40.574 --> 00:55:43.844 position:7% line:83% align:start
he can stop the activation of
trap cards like your Deck Virus

00:55:43.911 --> 00:55:45.178 position:24% line:89% align:start
and destroy them.

00:55:45.245 --> 00:55:47.213 position:27% line:89% align:start
My deck is safe.

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:49.382 position:7% line:89% align:start
 But your life points aren't.

00:55:49.449 --> 00:55:50.349 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ha.

00:55:50.416 --> 00:55:51.283 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:55:51.350 --> 00:55:52.384 position:24% line:89% align:start
[cackling echoes]

00:55:54.219 --> 00:55:58.222 position:21% line:83% align:start
I activate the magic
of Monster Reborn.

00:55:58.289 --> 00:56:00.391 position:27% line:83% align:start
Then I sacrifice
my reborn Ultimate

00:56:00.458 --> 00:56:02.460 position:5% line:89% align:start
Dragon to summon a new monster.

00:56:02.527 --> 00:56:03.293 position:41% line:89% align:start
 What?

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:04.528 position:13% line:89% align:start
SETO KAIBA: That's right.

00:56:04.594 --> 00:56:07.330 position:16% line:83% align:start
You see, I have an even
more powerful monster,

00:56:07.397 --> 00:56:12.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
compliments of Pegasus,
a shiny new dragon,

00:56:12.234 --> 00:56:14.403 position:7% line:89% align:start
the Blue Eyes Shining Dragon.

00:56:30.449 --> 00:56:31.884 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [roars]

00:56:31.951 --> 00:56:33.251 position:30% line:89% align:start
 Could it be?

00:56:33.318 --> 00:56:35.387 position:7% line:89% align:start
A card I've never seen before.

00:56:35.453 --> 00:56:37.522 position:30% line:83% align:start
 And for every
dragon in my graveyard

00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:41.125 position:10% line:83% align:start
the Blue Eyes Shining Dragon
gains an additional 300

00:56:41.191 --> 00:56:43.192 position:30% line:89% align:start
attack points.

00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:45.395 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's an extra
1,500 attack points

00:56:45.461 --> 00:56:48.197 position:19% line:83% align:start
right off the bat for
a punishing grand total

00:56:48.264 --> 00:56:52.301 position:27% line:11% align:start
of 4,500 points.

00:56:52.367 --> 00:56:53.535 position:30% line:89% align:start
ALL: [gasping]

00:56:53.602 --> 00:56:57.405 position:19% line:83% align:start
 But don't forget, due
to my Sorcerer's powers,

00:56:57.471 --> 00:57:01.542 position:16% line:83% align:start
your new dragon's attack
points decreased by 1,500.

00:57:01.609 --> 00:57:02.743 position:24% line:89% align:start
 I don't think so.

00:57:02.810 --> 00:57:05.245 position:19% line:83% align:start
Thanks to my Dragon's
Shining Diffusion.

00:57:08.213 --> 00:57:09.015 position:41% line:89% align:start
 What?

00:57:09.081 --> 00:57:10.416 position:10% line:89% align:start
Your points didn't decrease.

00:57:10.482 --> 00:57:11.750 position:35% line:89% align:start
 Exactly.

00:57:11.817 --> 00:57:13.652 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's because my Blue Eyes
Shining Dragon allows me

00:57:13.719 --> 00:57:16.254 position:19% line:83% align:start
to choose which magic
trap or monster effect

00:57:16.321 --> 00:57:18.156 position:7% line:89% align:start
cards can be used against him.

00:57:18.222 --> 00:57:18.890 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [grunt]

00:57:18.957 --> 00:57:20.058 position:21% line:89% align:start
 Just face it, Yugi.

00:57:20.123 --> 00:57:22.426 position:16% line:83% align:start
Your days as a champion
duelist are over.

00:57:22.492 --> 00:57:24.561 position:21% line:83% align:start
My Shining Dragon is
going to blast you

00:57:24.628 --> 00:57:27.396 position:24% line:83% align:start
back to the minor
leagues, where you belong.

00:57:27.463 --> 00:57:30.166 position:7% line:89% align:start
Now, hit him again, Blue Eyes.

00:57:30.232 --> 00:57:32.100 position:19% line:89% align:start
Shining Neutron Blast.

00:57:38.405 --> 00:57:39.673 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Ugh.

00:57:39.741 --> 00:57:41.342 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:57:41.408 --> 00:57:42.943 position:35% line:89% align:start
[beeping]

00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:43.644 position:44% line:89% align:start
 Hm.

00:57:48.381 --> 00:57:49.449 position:21% line:89% align:start
How do you like it?

00:57:49.515 --> 00:57:50.482 position:35% line:89% align:start
The pain?

00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:52.317 position:21% line:89% align:start
The sting of defeat?

00:57:52.384 --> 00:57:55.286 position:16% line:89% align:start
I felt it for too long.

00:57:55.354 --> 00:57:56.588 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [sigh]

00:57:56.655 --> 00:57:58.322 position:19% line:89% align:start
 Now, it's your turn.

00:58:01.025 --> 00:58:02.459 position:7% line:89% align:start
DISEMBODIED VOICE: [cackling]

00:58:04.427 --> 00:58:06.763 position:19% line:83% align:start
 You sure this is the
way to that mummy guy?

00:58:06.830 --> 00:58:07.664 position:33% line:89% align:start
JOEY: Yeah.

00:58:07.731 --> 00:58:09.632 position:7% line:89% align:start
Every hallway looks the same.

00:58:09.698 --> 00:58:10.466 position:44% line:89% align:start
 Ah!

00:58:10.532 --> 00:58:12.368 position:13% line:89% align:start
 Hey, what's wrong, Yuge?

00:58:12.434 --> 00:58:13.402 position:33% line:89% align:start
 It's weird.

00:58:13.469 --> 00:58:15.470 position:27% line:83% align:start
Suddenly, I feel
really weak, guys.

00:58:15.536 --> 00:58:17.505 position:33% line:89% align:start
BOTH: What?

00:58:17.572 --> 00:58:18.606 position:30% line:89% align:start
 Check it out.

00:58:18.673 --> 00:58:21.208 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's some kind of energy stream.

00:58:21.274 --> 00:58:24.611 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Maybe if we follow this
thing, it'll lead us to Anubis.

00:58:24.678 --> 00:58:26.379 position:21% line:89% align:start
 Sounds like a plan.

00:58:26.445 --> 00:58:27.246 position:30% line:89% align:start
Come on, pal.

00:58:36.788 --> 00:58:38.056 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Yugi.

00:58:38.123 --> 00:58:39.623 position:19% line:83% align:start
 This thing's putting
out energy waves that are

00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:43.394 position:5% line:89% align:start
making my pacemaker go haywire.

00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:47.363 position:16% line:89% align:start
[dramatic music playing]

00:59:01.307 --> 00:59:02.375 position:35% line:89% align:start
[shouting]

00:59:02.442 --> 00:59:03.543 position:5% line:89% align:start
MAX-A-MILLION PEGASUS: Up here.

00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:08.648 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'd hurry up.

00:59:08.715 --> 00:59:09.648 position:35% line:89% align:start
 Pegasus.

00:59:09.715 --> 00:59:10.482 position:44% line:89% align:start
 Ah.

00:59:23.094 --> 00:59:25.595 position:24% line:83% align:start
Pegasus, what are
you doing here?

00:59:25.662 --> 00:59:27.430 position:21% line:83% align:start
 How about we start
with a "thank you,"

00:59:27.496 --> 00:59:28.631 position:21% line:89% align:start
you little ingrate?

00:59:28.698 --> 00:59:30.666 position:16% line:83% align:start
If I hadn't figured out
what this whole Pyramid

00:59:30.733 --> 00:59:33.368 position:13% line:83% align:start
of Light thing was about,
you'd all be crushed.

00:59:33.435 --> 00:59:35.670 position:16% line:83% align:start
You see, Kaiba thinks he
got that card from me.

00:59:35.737 --> 00:59:38.539 position:5% line:83% align:start
When in fact, this has all been
arranged by an evil lord who

00:59:38.605 --> 00:59:41.275 position:19% line:83% align:start
tried to take over the
world five millennia ago

00:59:41.341 --> 00:59:42.576 position:27% line:83% align:start
and is now back
to finish the job.

00:59:42.643 --> 00:59:43.444 position:35% line:89% align:start
ALL: Huh?

00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:44.878 position:27% line:89% align:start
 I looked it up.

00:59:44.945 --> 00:59:47.714 position:10% line:83% align:start
Now, this Anubis has created
the ultimate shadow game,

00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:49.816 position:27% line:83% align:start
and he's getting
stronger every moment.

00:59:49.882 --> 00:59:52.617 position:24% line:83% align:start
 Then the prophecy
is being fulfilled.

00:59:52.684 --> 00:59:55.821 position:16% line:83% align:start
 And Yugi and Kaiba are
right in the middle of it.

00:59:55.887 --> 00:59:58.489 position:19% line:83% align:start
We've just gotta find
a way to help them.

01:00:02.727 --> 01:00:03.660 position:16% line:89% align:start
 Looks like this is it.

01:00:03.727 --> 01:00:04.527 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Yeah.

01:00:22.642 --> 01:00:25.879 position:33% line:89% align:start
 [cackling]

01:00:25.946 --> 01:00:28.714 position:27% line:83% align:start
Foolish mortals,
there is nothing

01:00:28.781 --> 01:00:30.850 position:7% line:89% align:start
you can do to stop my rebirth.

01:00:30.916 --> 01:00:33.551 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have infiltrated the
realm of the Pharaoh,

01:00:33.618 --> 01:00:36.488 position:24% line:83% align:start
and his life force
now feeds mine.

01:00:36.554 --> 01:00:39.389 position:13% line:83% align:start
 We won't stand here while
you suck the life out of others

01:00:39.456 --> 01:00:40.557 position:24% line:89% align:start
to save yourself.

01:00:40.624 --> 01:00:42.826 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're going to take
you down, Anubis.

01:00:42.893 --> 01:00:44.728 position:24% line:83% align:start
 I'd stay in that
casket if I were you.

01:00:44.795 --> 01:00:45.795 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Yeah.

01:00:45.862 --> 01:00:46.662 position:21% line:83% align:start
Because in case you
haven't noticed,

01:00:46.729 --> 01:00:49.498 position:10% line:89% align:start
we've got you out-numbered.

01:00:49.565 --> 01:00:51.500 position:33% line:89% align:start
[grumbling]

01:00:51.566 --> 01:00:52.801 position:35% line:89% align:start
[whimpers]

01:00:58.773 --> 01:01:02.342 position:30% line:83% align:start
This place is
crawling with stiffs.

01:01:02.408 --> 01:01:04.844 position:35% line:89% align:start
[cackling]

01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:06.880 position:13% line:89% align:start
 What do you want anyway?

01:01:06.946 --> 01:01:09.748 position:24% line:83% align:start
ANUBIS: Behold the
future since you won't

01:01:09.815 --> 01:01:12.618 position:10% line:89% align:start
live to see it for yourself.

01:01:12.684 --> 01:01:13.585 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [roar]

01:01:13.652 --> 01:01:14.685 position:30% line:89% align:start
ALL: [scream]

01:01:14.752 --> 01:01:16.654 position:27% line:83% align:start
ANUBIS: Soon my
beasts of destruction

01:01:16.721 --> 01:01:20.524 position:21% line:83% align:start
shall annihilate all
traces of life on earth,

01:01:20.590 --> 01:01:25.896 position:5% line:83% align:start
and I will finally complete that
which I started millennia ago.

01:01:25.962 --> 01:01:28.430 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [roars]

01:01:28.497 --> 01:01:31.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
ANUBIS: It is by your very
hand that this devastation

01:01:31.834 --> 01:01:33.868 position:21% line:89% align:start
will occur, mortal.

01:01:33.935 --> 01:01:36.137 position:33% line:83% align:start
For when you
released the Pharaoh,

01:01:36.204 --> 01:01:38.505 position:16% line:89% align:start
you released me as well.

01:01:38.572 --> 01:01:39.406 position:41% line:89% align:start
 What?

01:01:39.473 --> 01:01:40.275 position:27% line:89% align:start
 What's he mean?

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:41.909 position:10% line:89% align:start
 This is between me and him.

01:01:41.975 --> 01:01:43.143 position:38% line:89% align:start
Listen.

01:01:43.210 --> 01:01:44.710 position:19% line:83% align:start
You guys need to find
a way out of this place

01:01:44.777 --> 01:01:45.945 position:21% line:89% align:start
and save yourselves.

01:01:46.013 --> 01:01:48.380 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm going to stay here
and figure this out.

01:01:48.447 --> 01:01:49.649 position:24% line:89% align:start
 Figure what out?

01:01:49.715 --> 01:01:51.716 position:19% line:83% align:start
 There was a prophecy
my grandpa read to me

01:01:51.783 --> 01:01:53.485 position:30% line:83% align:start
in the museum,
and I think it may

01:01:53.552 --> 01:01:54.653 position:5% line:89% align:start
have something to do with this.

01:01:54.719 --> 01:01:56.587 position:16% line:89% align:start
I just don't know what.

01:01:56.654 --> 01:01:58.522 position:13% line:89% align:start
 Yuge, that's crazy talk.

01:01:58.589 --> 01:01:59.423 position:27% line:89% align:start
 Just go, guys.

01:01:59.490 --> 01:02:00.491 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Listen.

01:02:00.558 --> 01:02:01.892 position:30% line:83% align:start
There's no way
we're leaving you.

01:02:01.959 --> 01:02:03.060 position:30% line:89% align:start
We're a team.

01:02:03.127 --> 01:02:04.327 position:24% line:83% align:start
We've been through
everything together,

01:02:04.394 --> 01:02:06.395 position:19% line:83% align:start
and there's no chance
we're turning our back

01:02:06.462 --> 01:02:07.496 position:27% line:89% align:start
on you now, pal.

01:02:07.563 --> 01:02:08.564 position:30% line:89% align:start
 That's right.

01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:10.799 position:30% line:83% align:start
 But the last
thing I want to do

01:02:10.866 --> 01:02:13.936 position:30% line:83% align:start
is put my best
friends in danger.

01:02:14.002 --> 01:02:14.903 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Ugh.

01:02:14.970 --> 01:02:15.803 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yugi.

01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:16.537 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Téa.

01:02:16.604 --> 01:02:18.906 position:21% line:89% align:start
 What are you doing?

01:02:18.973 --> 01:02:21.175 position:5% line:89% align:start
Téa, please get down from there.

01:02:21.242 --> 01:02:22.509 position:21% line:89% align:start
 My friends need me.

01:02:22.576 --> 01:02:23.610 position:27% line:89% align:start
I just know it.

01:02:27.746 --> 01:02:28.581 position:30% line:89% align:start
 Foolish girl.

01:02:31.616 --> 01:02:34.485 position:24% line:83% align:start
SOLOMON: Téa, come
back in here at once.

01:02:34.552 --> 01:02:37.188 position:7% line:89% align:start
 I've got to help my friends.

01:02:37.255 --> 01:02:38.555 position:10% line:89% align:start
MOKUBA KAIBA: She's falling.

01:02:38.622 --> 01:02:39.423 position:24% line:89% align:start
SOLOMON: Grab her.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.196 position:24% line:83% align:start
DISEMBODIED VOICE:
[non-english speech]

01:02:46.263 --> 01:02:49.732 position:33% line:89% align:start
 [screaming]

01:02:54.269 --> 01:02:55.704 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm coming, guys.

01:02:59.273 --> 01:03:00.574 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Téa.

01:03:00.641 --> 01:03:01.709 position:16% line:89% align:start
JOEY: How'd you find us?

01:03:01.775 --> 01:03:03.443 position:21% line:89% align:start
 Are you kidding me?

01:03:03.509 --> 01:03:05.778 position:16% line:83% align:start
Remember the friendship
symbol we drew.

01:03:05.845 --> 01:03:07.646 position:24% line:89% align:start
 Of course, we do.

01:03:07.714 --> 01:03:09.848 position:16% line:83% align:start
 The ink may have faded,
but our bond never will.

01:03:09.915 --> 01:03:10.716 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Right.

01:03:10.782 --> 01:03:12.017 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Right.

01:03:12.084 --> 01:03:16.621 position:16% line:83% align:start
 We're all with you, and
we'll always be with you.

01:03:16.687 --> 01:03:18.222 position:30% line:89% align:start
 Thanks, guys.

01:03:18.289 --> 01:03:19.757 position:19% line:83% align:start
Friends till the end.
- You said it.

01:03:19.824 --> 01:03:20.624 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Yeah.

01:03:20.690 --> 01:03:21.958 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Right.

01:03:22.025 --> 01:03:24.728 position:13% line:83% align:start
 You see, there's nothing
out there that's more

01:03:24.794 --> 01:03:26.495 position:7% line:89% align:start
powerful than our friendship.

01:03:26.562 --> 01:03:27.563 position:30% line:89% align:start
 Téa's right.

01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:28.697 position:30% line:89% align:start
I can feel it.

01:03:28.764 --> 01:03:30.733 position:24% line:83% align:start
All we have to do
is stick together.

01:03:30.799 --> 01:03:33.501 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Hey, sticking together
is what we do best.

01:03:33.568 --> 01:03:35.603 position:7% line:89% align:start
 We'll never leave your side.

01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:36.537 position:41% line:89% align:start
Whoa.

01:03:36.604 --> 01:03:37.604 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Téa!

01:03:37.671 --> 01:03:39.040 position:33% line:83% align:start
ANUBIS: Your
pathetic little bond

01:03:39.107 --> 01:03:41.642 position:10% line:89% align:start
is nothing against my power.

01:03:41.708 --> 01:03:44.543 position:24% line:83% align:start
Soon, my soul will
be fully restored

01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:47.647 position:30% line:83% align:start
and your world
shrouded in darkness.

01:03:47.713 --> 01:03:51.483 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yet you fools prattle
on about togetherness.

01:03:51.549 --> 01:03:53.919 position:30% line:89% align:start
Then so be it.

01:03:53.985 --> 01:03:54.819 position:35% line:89% align:start
ALL: Téa!

01:03:58.822 --> 01:03:59.757 position:44% line:89% align:start
Téa!

01:03:59.823 --> 01:04:00.624 position:33% line:89% align:start
 Watch out!

01:04:00.691 --> 01:04:01.758 position:33% line:89% align:start
 [whimpers]

01:04:01.825 --> 01:04:03.027 position:35% line:89% align:start
[groaning]

01:04:03.093 --> 01:04:06.029 position:24% line:89% align:start
[whimpers] Hiyah!

01:04:06.095 --> 01:04:06.930 position:41% line:89% align:start
 What?

01:04:06.996 --> 01:04:08.797 position:27% line:89% align:start
I could do that.

01:04:08.864 --> 01:04:10.266 position:44% line:89% align:start
 Hm.

01:04:10.333 --> 01:04:11.767 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ahh!

01:04:11.833 --> 01:04:15.037 position:35% line:89% align:start
[whimpers]

01:04:15.103 --> 01:04:16.837 position:16% line:89% align:start
 Let's take them apart.

01:04:16.904 --> 01:04:18.673 position:33% line:89% align:start
 Literally.

01:04:18.739 --> 01:04:19.807 position:33% line:89% align:start
 Excuse me.

01:04:19.874 --> 01:04:22.876 position:24% line:83% align:start
JOEY: Hey, Johnny
Rotten, over here.

01:04:22.943 --> 01:04:24.778 position:35% line:89% align:start
Take this.

01:04:24.844 --> 01:04:26.779 position:35% line:89% align:start
[shouting]

01:04:26.845 --> 01:04:30.916 position:19% line:83% align:start
 [shouts] That wasn't
supposed to happen.

01:04:30.983 --> 01:04:31.783 position:33% line:89% align:start
 [grumbles]

01:04:31.850 --> 01:04:32.884 position:35% line:89% align:start
 Tristan!

01:04:32.951 --> 01:04:34.786 position:30% line:83% align:start
 Kicks to the
stomach don't work.

01:04:34.852 --> 01:04:36.788 position:7% line:89% align:start
 Neither do kicks to the head.

01:04:36.854 --> 01:04:38.522 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Nay.

01:04:38.588 --> 01:04:41.792 position:27% line:89% align:start
Let's try this.

01:04:41.858 --> 01:04:43.592 position:10% line:89% align:start
These carcasses won't quit.

01:04:43.659 --> 01:04:46.296 position:24% line:83% align:start
How do you destroy
what's already dead?

01:04:46.363 --> 01:04:46.862 position:35% line:89% align:start
[grumbles]

01:04:46.929 --> 01:04:48.698 position:35% line:89% align:start
 [sobbing]

01:04:48.764 --> 01:04:49.731 position:30% line:89% align:start
 It's no use.

01:04:49.798 --> 01:04:52.701 position:19% line:89% align:start
They just keep coming.

01:04:52.767 --> 01:04:54.936 position:24% line:89% align:start
ANUBIS: [cackling]

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:00.908 position:33% line:89% align:start
 [grunting]

01:05:00.975 --> 01:05:03.110 position:10% line:89% align:start
 How the mighty have fallen.

01:05:03.177 --> 01:05:05.678 position:24% line:83% align:start
Lying there on the
ground like a dog waiting

01:05:05.745 --> 01:05:07.546 position:10% line:89% align:start
to be put out of its misery.

01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:08.613 position:38% line:89% align:start
Get up.

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:10.015 position:27% line:83% align:start
Get up, so I can
knock you back down.

01:05:12.818 --> 01:05:15.953 position:19% line:83% align:start
 Something's not right
here, Kaiba, and you know it.

01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:18.689 position:30% line:83% align:start
 Spare me the
mystic mumbo jumbo.

01:05:18.756 --> 01:05:21.024 position:13% line:83% align:start
You just can't stand that
your reputation's at stake.

01:05:21.092 --> 01:05:25.627 position:19% line:83% align:start
 [scoffs] You have no
idea what's at stake here.

01:05:25.694 --> 01:05:31.000 position:16% line:83% align:start
But believe me, I cannot
let you win this duel.

01:05:31.066 --> 01:05:34.602 position:5% line:89% align:start
Big Shield Gardna, defense mode.

01:05:34.669 --> 01:05:36.070 position:24% line:83% align:start
 You know, I think
you're the one

01:05:36.137 --> 01:05:38.972 position:10% line:83% align:start
who doesn't have a clue what
this match is really about.

01:05:39.039 --> 01:05:42.009 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's about payback.

01:05:42.075 --> 01:05:43.977 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ha.

01:05:44.044 --> 01:05:45.911 position:5% line:89% align:start
And this card will see to that.

01:05:49.415 --> 01:05:52.984 position:5% line:83% align:start
But first, let's deal with your
so-called Big Shield Gardna.

01:05:53.051 --> 01:05:55.652 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you think it's big
enough to block the power

01:05:55.719 --> 01:05:57.688 position:5% line:89% align:start
of my Blue Eyes Shining Dragon?

01:06:02.925 --> 01:06:03.860 position:16% line:89% align:start
MOKUBA KAIBA: Hey, look.

01:06:03.926 --> 01:06:04.694 position:24% line:89% align:start
Joey and Tristan.

01:06:04.761 --> 01:06:07.729 position:13% line:89% align:start
We got to get down there.

01:06:07.796 --> 01:06:11.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Shining Dragon, attack
with Shining Neutron Blast.

01:06:14.069 --> 01:06:16.971 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Ugh.

01:06:17.038 --> 01:06:17.938 position:35% line:89% align:start
[shatters]

01:06:19.974 --> 01:06:22.376 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

01:06:22.443 --> 01:06:24.610 position:27% line:83% align:start
 I told you when
we started this duel

01:06:24.676 --> 01:06:27.746 position:13% line:83% align:start
that this time things were
going to be different, Yugi.

01:06:27.813 --> 01:06:29.882 position:13% line:83% align:start
KAIBA AND ANUBIS: You may
have beaten me in the past,

01:06:29.948 --> 01:06:31.849 position:16% line:83% align:start
but now there's nothing
you can do to stop

01:06:31.916 --> 01:06:33.851 position:13% line:89% align:start
me from having my revenge.

01:06:33.918 --> 01:06:36.020 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're finished.

01:06:36.087 --> 01:06:40.123 position:24% line:89% align:start
 Not yet, I'm not.

01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:43.726 position:16% line:83% align:start
I activate Pot of Greed,
which lets me draw two cards.

01:06:48.831 --> 01:06:51.132 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now, I summon Watapon
in defense mode.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:54.135 position:16% line:83% align:start
And since I used Pot of
Greed to play Watapon,

01:06:54.202 --> 01:06:56.804 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can summon another
monster to the field.

01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:59.973 position:19% line:83% align:start
And I choose Obnoxious
Celtic Guardian.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:01.208 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's your move.

01:07:01.275 --> 01:07:03.810 position:19% line:83% align:start
 So let me see if I've
got this right now.

01:07:03.876 --> 01:07:06.813 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're playing a
cream puff and an elf.

01:07:06.879 --> 01:07:09.047 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well, then it's your funeral.

01:07:09.114 --> 01:07:11.783 position:13% line:83% align:start
First, the Card of Demise
I played before sends

01:07:11.850 --> 01:07:14.086 position:7% line:89% align:start
this dragon to the graveyard.

01:07:14.152 --> 01:07:16.654 position:16% line:83% align:start
And I know you know what
that means, don't you?

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:19.789 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now my Blue Eyes Shining Dragon
has more destructive power

01:07:19.856 --> 01:07:20.990 position:24% line:89% align:start
than ever before.

01:07:21.057 --> 01:07:22.926 position:10% line:89% align:start
 Kaiba, please listen to me.

01:07:22.992 --> 01:07:24.928 position:16% line:83% align:start
KAIBA AND ANUBIS: All I
want to hear from you is

01:07:24.994 --> 01:07:27.963 position:7% line:89% align:start
your anguished cry of defeat.

01:07:28.030 --> 01:07:32.733 position:13% line:83% align:start
 Kaiba, for the last time,
I'm begging you to stop this.

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:34.235 position:16% line:89% align:start
People are getting hurt.

01:07:34.302 --> 01:07:38.139 position:7% line:83% align:start
Lives are in danger, and this
Pyramid of Light you've created

01:07:38.206 --> 01:07:40.774 position:16% line:89% align:start
is the source of it all.

01:07:40.841 --> 01:07:43.443 position:10% line:83% align:start
There's a dark power in our
midst, and you can't deny it.

01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:46.679 position:13% line:83% align:start
With every life point lost
we both become weaker.

01:07:46.745 --> 01:07:48.848 position:16% line:89% align:start
I know you can feel it.

01:07:48.914 --> 01:07:51.883 position:21% line:83% align:start
We must stop before
it's too late.

01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:53.151 position:7% line:89% align:start
KAIBA AND ANUBIS: Ridiculous.

01:07:53.218 --> 01:07:55.919 position:19% line:83% align:start
I can attack Yugi now
with my Shining Dragon

01:07:55.986 --> 01:07:57.855 position:21% line:83% align:start
and destroy the rest
of his life points.

01:07:57.921 --> 01:07:59.022 position:10% line:89% align:start
SETO KAIBA (VOICEOVER): No.

01:07:59.089 --> 01:08:00.357 position:24% line:83% align:start
I should stick to
my original strategy

01:08:00.424 --> 01:08:04.461 position:16% line:83% align:start
and defeat Yugi with his
very own Egyptian God Cards.

01:08:04.528 --> 01:08:07.863 position:16% line:83% align:start
 I'm afraid that for you
it's already too late, Yugi.

01:08:07.929 --> 01:08:08.897 position:21% line:89% align:start
 No, Kaiba, please.

01:08:08.964 --> 01:08:10.098 position:21% line:89% align:start
You mustn't do this.

01:08:10.165 --> 01:08:12.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
We still have time
to stop this madness.

01:08:12.534 --> 01:08:15.102 position:24% line:83% align:start
All we have to do
is end this duel.

01:08:15.169 --> 01:08:17.204 position:27% line:83% align:start
 You know, Yugi,
you're absolutely right.

01:08:17.271 --> 01:08:20.107 position:10% line:83% align:start
Stopping the duel is exactly
what I'm going to do.

01:08:20.174 --> 01:08:23.977 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now, Shining Blue Eyes activate
your final special abilities.

01:08:24.043 --> 01:08:25.445 position:44% line:89% align:start
 No.

01:08:25.512 --> 01:08:27.880 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're playing with forces
you can't possibly understand.

01:08:27.946 --> 01:08:29.014 position:7% line:89% align:start
KAIBA AND ANUBIS: Finish him.

01:08:29.081 --> 01:08:29.882 position:27% line:89% align:start
Finish him now.

01:08:29.948 --> 01:08:31.183 position:10% line:89% align:start
SETO KAIBA (VOICEOVER): No.

01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:33.751 position:24% line:83% align:start
I wanted a perfect
victory, and with this card

01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:37.721 position:13% line:83% align:start
I can use Yugi's own most
powerful monsters against him.

01:08:37.787 --> 01:08:40.223 position:21% line:89% align:start
I use Shining Nova.

01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:43.826 position:7% line:83% align:start
It puts the rage of 1,000 Blue
Eyes into a blast so strong,

01:08:43.893 --> 01:08:46.996 position:24% line:83% align:start
it destroys itself
plus anything I choose.

01:08:47.062 --> 01:08:49.298 position:10% line:83% align:start
And the card that will feel
the wrath of my Blue Eyes

01:08:49.365 --> 01:08:51.766 position:24% line:83% align:start
Shining Dragon is
the Pyramid of Light.

01:08:51.833 --> 01:08:53.001 position:19% line:89% align:start
KAIBA AND ANUBIS: No.

01:08:53.067 --> 01:08:54.169 position:19% line:83% align:start
I need the Pyramid to
destroy the Pharaoh.

01:08:54.235 --> 01:08:55.603 position:16% line:83% align:start
SETO KAIBA (VOICEOVER):
What am I saying?

01:08:55.669 --> 01:09:00.207 position:13% line:83% align:start
I must destroy it to gain
control of Yugi's God Cards.

01:09:00.274 --> 01:09:02.875 position:24% line:83% align:start
 Your reign as the
King of Games is over.

01:09:02.942 --> 01:09:05.811 position:24% line:83% align:start
That title will be
mine, as will all three

01:09:05.878 --> 01:09:07.846 position:10% line:89% align:start
of your Egyptian God Cards.

01:09:07.913 --> 01:09:11.850 position:16% line:83% align:start
Blue Eyes Shining Dragon
sacrifice yourself and destroy

01:09:11.917 --> 01:09:13.251 position:19% line:89% align:start
the Pyramid of Light.

01:09:19.256 --> 01:09:23.826 position:16% line:89% align:start
[dramatic music playing]

01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:27.162 position:24% line:89% align:start
ANUBIS: [cackling]

01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:30.065 position:21% line:89% align:start
This I cannot allow.

01:09:30.132 --> 01:09:31.233 position:41% line:89% align:start
 What?

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:32.700 position:21% line:83% align:start
The Pyramid of Light
wasn't destroyed?

01:09:32.767 --> 01:09:36.970 position:10% line:83% align:start
ANUBIS: The Pyramid of Light
endures, because I will it,

01:09:37.038 --> 01:09:39.239 position:19% line:89% align:start
so great is my power.

01:09:39.306 --> 01:09:40.907 position:21% line:89% align:start
 Hey, what is this?

01:09:40.974 --> 01:09:42.841 position:5% line:89% align:start
Show yourself, whoever you are.

01:09:42.908 --> 01:09:44.777 position:21% line:83% align:start
ANUBIS: I have been
here the whole time,

01:09:44.843 --> 01:09:46.979 position:5% line:89% align:start
mortal, whispering in your ear.

01:09:47.046 --> 01:09:48.214 position:27% line:89% align:start
 The whole time?

01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:49.081 position:44% line:89% align:start
No.

01:09:49.148 --> 01:09:51.049 position:10% line:89% align:start
This is some sort of trick.

01:09:51.115 --> 01:09:52.685 position:24% line:89% align:start
 Kaiba, look out!

01:09:57.354 --> 01:09:58.288 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Huh?

01:09:58.355 --> 01:09:59.923 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ugh!

01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:01.091 position:33% line:89% align:start
 Kaiba, no!

01:10:01.158 --> 01:10:04.827 position:21% line:83% align:start
 You have served me
well, little worm.

01:10:04.894 --> 01:10:06.562 position:19% line:83% align:start
But you have outlived
your usefulness.

01:10:06.629 --> 01:10:08.930 position:35% line:89% align:start
 [grunts]

01:10:08.997 --> 01:10:11.299 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Kaiba!

01:10:11.366 --> 01:10:15.236 position:19% line:89% align:start
 [non-english speech]

01:10:23.443 --> 01:10:26.144 position:24% line:83% align:start
 So it's been you
behind this whole duel,

01:10:26.211 --> 01:10:29.982 position:7% line:83% align:start
manipulating Kaiba all along,
the Egyptian Lord of the

01:10:30.048 --> 01:10:31.250 position:30% line:89% align:start
Dead, Anubis.

01:10:31.316 --> 01:10:33.951 position:19% line:83% align:start
 I am pleased that you
remember me after all

01:10:34.018 --> 01:10:35.987 position:16% line:89% align:start
these years, my Pharaoh.

01:10:36.053 --> 01:10:39.356 position:16% line:83% align:start
It will make my ultimate
vengeance all the sweeter.

01:10:39.422 --> 01:10:44.026 position:10% line:83% align:start
You will fall, and my reign
of destruction shall begin.

01:10:44.093 --> 01:10:45.127 position:33% line:89% align:start
 We'll see.

01:10:45.194 --> 01:10:47.162 position:30% line:83% align:start
 The souls of
your mortal friends

01:10:47.229 --> 01:10:50.231 position:21% line:83% align:start
have already fallen,
trapped within your puzzle.

01:10:50.299 --> 01:10:51.432 position:33% line:89% align:start
 My friends?

01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:54.002 position:24% line:83% align:start
ANUBIS: Lost in a
labyrinth of the dead.

01:10:54.068 --> 01:10:55.035 position:30% line:89% align:start
 You're wrong.

01:10:55.103 --> 01:10:57.170 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can still sense
their presence,

01:10:57.237 --> 01:10:59.239 position:5% line:89% align:start
and I will fight to defend them.

01:10:59.306 --> 01:11:02.309 position:13% line:83% align:start
No matter what happens, I
will not let your evil plan

01:11:02.376 --> 01:11:04.010 position:19% line:89% align:start
come to pass, Anubis.

01:11:04.076 --> 01:11:07.846 position:24% line:5% align:start
 All I need do is
defeat you in this duel,

01:11:07.912 --> 01:11:10.115 position:27% line:83% align:start
and the prophecy
will be fulfilled.

01:11:10.181 --> 01:11:12.117 position:19% line:89% align:start
You will be destroyed.

01:11:12.183 --> 01:11:14.151 position:27% line:83% align:start
The magic of the
shadow games that you

01:11:14.218 --> 01:11:16.987 position:19% line:83% align:start
locked away centuries
ago will once again

01:11:17.054 --> 01:11:19.022 position:10% line:89% align:start
be unleashed into the world.

01:11:19.088 --> 01:11:21.991 position:21% line:83% align:start
And I shall finally
take my rightful place

01:11:22.058 --> 01:11:23.859 position:7% line:89% align:start
as the pharaoh of this realm.

01:11:23.926 --> 01:11:26.429 position:21% line:83% align:start
With the Pyramid of
Light at my command,

01:11:26.496 --> 01:11:30.232 position:21% line:83% align:start
there is nothing you
can do to stop me.

01:11:30.299 --> 01:11:34.869 position:21% line:83% align:start
The ultimate shadow
game is just beginning.

01:11:34.935 --> 01:11:36.836 position:35% line:89% align:start
[cackling]

01:11:56.354 --> 01:12:01.258 position:10% line:83% align:start
I summon the Terrible Beasts
Andro Sphinx and Sphinx Teleia.

01:12:05.961 --> 01:12:09.197 position:35% line:89% align:start
[roaring]

01:12:11.733 --> 01:12:12.400 position:21% line:89% align:start
 Reverse of Reverse.

01:12:15.336 --> 01:12:19.138 position:16% line:83% align:start
ANUBIS: Search your deck
from now until doomsday,

01:12:19.206 --> 01:12:21.040 position:30% line:83% align:start
and you still
won't find anything

01:12:21.107 --> 01:12:24.210 position:13% line:83% align:start
to stand against my Savage
Shadow Realm Beasts.

01:12:24.277 --> 01:12:25.944 position:27% line:89% align:start
No, my Pharaoh.

01:12:26.011 --> 01:12:29.147 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid that for
you, Doomsday is today.

01:12:32.484 --> 01:12:35.086 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now watch as your
last line of defense

01:12:35.152 --> 01:12:37.321 position:21% line:83% align:start
is ripped to shreds
before your eyes.

01:12:37.388 --> 01:12:40.156 position:24% line:83% align:start
Sphinx Teleia, it
is feeding time.

01:12:40.223 --> 01:12:42.392 position:30% line:89% align:start
 [screeching]

01:12:47.062 --> 01:12:48.364 position:21% line:89% align:start
 My Celtic Guardian!

01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:49.565 position:44% line:89% align:start
No!

01:12:49.631 --> 01:12:51.933 position:21% line:83% align:start
 And now, it is your
turn, Andro Sphinx.

01:12:51.999 --> 01:12:54.168 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [roars]

01:12:56.437 --> 01:12:57.571 position:35% line:89% align:start
[shatters]

01:12:57.638 --> 01:13:01.073 position:16% line:83% align:start
 Each time Andro Sphinx
destroys a monster, half

01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:03.476 position:16% line:83% align:start
of that monster's attack
points are taken away

01:13:03.542 --> 01:13:05.711 position:5% line:89% align:start
from my opponent's life points.

01:13:05.778 --> 01:13:08.947 position:7% line:89% align:start
You have only 100 points left.

01:13:09.013 --> 01:13:09.447 position:38% line:89% align:start
 Oh no!

01:13:09.514 --> 01:13:10.682 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Yugi.

01:13:10.749 --> 01:13:16.053 position:19% line:83% align:start
 [cackling] Your fate
is sealed, Pharaoh.

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:18.355 position:19% line:83% align:start
Soon, you will be the
relic buried away.

01:13:18.422 --> 01:13:22.125 position:19% line:83% align:start
[chuckles] Soon, worms
will feast on your flesh,

01:13:22.191 --> 01:13:25.227 position:13% line:89% align:start
just as they did on mine.

01:13:25.294 --> 01:13:27.529 position:27% line:5% align:start
 Your worms will
have to wait, Anubis.

01:13:27.596 --> 01:13:31.733 position:19% line:5% align:start
I trust my fate to the
heart of the cards.

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:37.070 position:24% line:83% align:start
No monsters, just
two magic cards.

01:13:37.137 --> 01:13:41.274 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's all I have left.

01:13:41.341 --> 01:13:42.742 position:33% line:89% align:start
 [grumbles]

01:13:42.809 --> 01:13:45.043 position:10% line:89% align:start
 [whimpers] He's all yours.

01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:46.278 position:13% line:89% align:start
 I don't want your mummy.

01:13:46.345 --> 01:13:47.146 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ah!

01:13:47.212 --> 01:13:48.514 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [gasps]

01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:52.150 position:16% line:83% align:start
YUGI: That eye up there
seems to be his power source.

01:13:52.216 --> 01:13:53.484 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, hold on.

01:13:53.551 --> 01:13:54.652 position:30% line:89% align:start
The prophecy.

01:13:54.719 --> 01:13:57.120 position:24% line:83% align:start
"The eye that sees
what's yet to come,

01:13:57.187 --> 01:14:00.123 position:7% line:83% align:start
its vision shall be fulfilled
unless blinded by

01:14:00.190 --> 01:14:01.591 position:19% line:89% align:start
events predetermined."

01:14:01.658 --> 01:14:05.060 position:10% line:83% align:start
Predetermined events is just
another way of saying fate.

01:14:05.127 --> 01:14:07.463 position:13% line:83% align:start
The prophecy means the eye
can be blinded by fate.

01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:08.229 position:35% line:89% align:start
 [shouts]

01:14:08.296 --> 01:14:09.998 position:19% line:89% align:start
 Heads up, you freak!

01:14:10.064 --> 01:14:11.999 position:35% line:89% align:start
 [groans]

01:14:12.065 --> 01:14:13.267 position:30% line:89% align:start
 The prophecy.

01:14:13.334 --> 01:14:14.501 position:10% line:89% align:start
I think I've figured it out.

01:14:14.569 --> 01:14:15.536 position:24% line:89% align:start
 All right, Yuge.

01:14:15.602 --> 01:14:16.537 position:19% line:89% align:start
Way to use your head.

01:14:16.603 --> 01:14:17.871 position:33% line:89% align:start
 We'll see.

01:14:17.937 --> 01:14:22.508 position:19% line:83% align:start
If I'm right, I gotta
find that Dagger of Fate.

01:14:22.575 --> 01:14:23.576 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

01:14:23.643 --> 01:14:24.310 position:41% line:89% align:start
 Ugh.

01:14:24.377 --> 01:14:28.413 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yugi, please hurry.

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:30.148 position:33% line:89% align:start
 It's empty.

01:14:30.215 --> 01:14:32.183 position:10% line:89% align:start
Please be in here somewhere.

01:14:32.249 --> 01:14:33.083 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes!

01:14:33.150 --> 01:14:35.586 position:33% line:89% align:start
 [whimpers]

01:14:35.653 --> 01:14:37.421 position:33% line:89% align:start
 Here it is.

01:14:37.488 --> 01:14:41.257 position:21% line:83% align:start
Let's just hope that
fate is on our side.

01:14:41.324 --> 01:14:44.526 position:24% line:89% align:start
[grunts] Come on.

01:14:44.594 --> 01:14:45.527 position:38% line:89% align:start
[clink]

01:14:45.594 --> 01:14:48.464 position:44% line:89% align:start
No!

01:14:48.530 --> 01:14:51.265 position:33% line:89% align:start
 [grumbles]

01:14:55.369 --> 01:14:59.272 position:21% line:83% align:start
 I sense a weakness
in the Pyramid's power.

01:14:59.339 --> 01:15:00.807 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hm, Yugi.

01:15:00.874 --> 01:15:02.809 position:16% line:89% align:start
I activate Double Spell.

01:15:02.876 --> 01:15:05.110 position:24% line:83% align:start
By discarding one
card from my hand

01:15:05.177 --> 01:15:07.580 position:10% line:83% align:start
I can select a new one from
my opponent's graveyard

01:15:07.646 --> 01:15:09.214 position:19% line:89% align:start
and use it as my own.

01:15:11.616 --> 01:15:14.251 position:5% line:89% align:start
And I know just the card I want.

01:15:20.289 --> 01:15:21.524 position:27% line:89% align:start
Monster Reborn.

01:15:21.591 --> 01:15:25.293 position:21% line:83% align:start
So come forth Mighty
Blue Eyes Shining Dragon.

01:15:33.267 --> 01:15:35.436 position:16% line:83% align:start
And I have a hunch this
time your Pyramid won't

01:15:35.503 --> 01:15:37.136 position:13% line:89% align:start
be able to stand up to it.

01:15:37.203 --> 01:15:39.138 position:27% line:89% align:start
Go Shining Nova.

01:15:39.205 --> 01:15:43.576 position:10% line:83% align:start
Use all your power to finish
what you started before

01:15:43.643 --> 01:15:45.310 position:27% line:83% align:start
and destroy the
Pyramid of Light.

01:15:51.682 --> 01:15:52.617 position:33% line:89% align:start

01:16:30.247 --> 01:16:31.048 position:38% line:89% align:start
ALL: Oh.

01:16:37.955 --> 01:16:41.391 position:7% line:83% align:start
And with that I'll end my turn
now that the Pyramid of Light

01:16:41.457 --> 01:16:42.625 position:38% line:89% align:start
is gone.

01:16:42.692 --> 01:16:45.260 position:21% line:83% align:start
 Your opponent tried
and failed to destroy

01:16:45.327 --> 01:16:46.428 position:7% line:89% align:start
the Pyramid with that dragon.

01:16:46.495 --> 01:16:49.230 position:24% line:83% align:start
You alone couldn't
make such a difference.

01:16:49.297 --> 01:16:50.464 position:30% line:83% align:start
 You're quite
right that I could

01:16:50.531 --> 01:16:52.366 position:10% line:89% align:start
not have done it all alone.

01:16:52.433 --> 01:16:54.200 position:30% line:83% align:start
 You may have
destroyed the card,

01:16:54.267 --> 01:16:57.537 position:10% line:83% align:start
Pharaoh, but not the Pyramid
of Light around my neck.

01:16:57.604 --> 01:16:58.538 position:24% line:89% align:start
Behold its power.

01:17:01.608 --> 01:17:06.177 position:5% line:83% align:start
Inspired by your modern sayings,
two heads are better than one.

01:17:08.646 --> 01:17:11.282 position:13% line:89% align:start
Theinen the Great Sphinx.

 [roaring]

01:17:14.351 --> 01:17:18.388 position:13% line:83% align:start
 And now, Pyramid of Light
feed this perfect beast

01:17:18.455 --> 01:17:20.256 position:13% line:89% align:start
with Dead Souls Set Free.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.500 position:33% line:89% align:start
 Hey, look.

01:17:33.567 --> 01:17:36.336 position:21% line:5% align:start
Tell me that attack
meter's broke.

01:17:36.403 --> 01:17:39.639 position:21% line:89% align:start
 Say hello, Theinen.

01:17:39.706 --> 01:17:42.575 position:38% line:89% align:start
 [roars]

01:17:42.642 --> 01:17:46.945 position:7% line:83% align:start
 5,000 years ago, I never had
the chance to summon Theinen

01:17:47.012 --> 01:17:50.214 position:24% line:83% align:start
to our battle, so
I think it would

01:17:50.281 --> 01:17:52.283 position:24% line:83% align:start
be best if we made
up for lost time

01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:54.485 position:24% line:83% align:start
and finally had a
proper introduction.

01:17:54.552 --> 01:17:56.453 position:13% line:89% align:start
Theinen, meet the Pharaoh.

01:17:56.519 --> 01:17:58.588 position:10% line:89% align:start
And Pharaoh, meet your doom.

01:17:58.655 --> 01:18:00.457 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

01:18:00.523 --> 01:18:02.591 position:16% line:83% align:start
 We don't have anything
that can beat that Sphinx.

01:18:02.658 --> 01:18:03.792 position:24% line:89% align:start
 Yes, we do, Yugi.

01:18:03.859 --> 01:18:07.630 position:21% line:83% align:start
If I'm correct about
what Kaiba was planning.

01:18:07.696 --> 01:18:09.697 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now then, Anubis,
this is still a duel,

01:18:09.764 --> 01:18:12.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
and I still have one
face down card to play,

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:15.636 position:21% line:83% align:start
Reverse of Reverse,
which allows me to use

01:18:15.702 --> 01:18:18.137 position:7% line:89% align:start
the last card played by Kaiba.

01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:23.609 position:27% line:83% align:start
Return from the
Different Dimension.

01:18:23.676 --> 01:18:26.544 position:10% line:83% align:start
When Kaiba spoke of dealing
me the perfect defeat,

01:18:26.611 --> 01:18:29.514 position:19% line:83% align:start
he meant wiping me out
with my own Egyptian Gods.

01:18:33.851 --> 01:18:37.220 position:19% line:83% align:start
Allow me to introduce
Obelisk the Tormentor,

01:18:37.286 --> 01:18:41.257 position:13% line:83% align:start
Slifer the sky dragon, and
the Winged Dragon of Ra.

01:18:41.324 --> 01:18:46.695 position:13% line:83% align:start
My Egyptian Gods, combine
now for infinite power.

01:19:49.848 --> 01:19:50.781 position:33% line:89% align:start
 We did it.

 Kaiba, are you all right?

01:20:03.525 --> 01:20:06.394 position:27% line:89% align:start
Let me help you.

01:20:06.461 --> 01:20:07.595 position:10% line:89% align:start

01:25:02.708 --> 01:25:04.142 position:21% line:89% align:start

 I gotta say it's nice to
have the old Kaiba back.

01:25:10.715 --> 01:25:11.514 position:41% line:89% align:start

bring up all the damage you did

to the Duel Dome, because I
don't think his insurance is

 He's got plenty
of money, Grandpa.

01:25:27.328 --> 01:25:29.964 position:21% line:83% align:start
But what he doesn't
have is one of these.

01:25:30.031 --> 01:25:33.600 position:5% line:83% align:start
And unless he changes, he won't
have best friends like this.

What Kaiba doesn't
get is that victory

01:25:35.135 --> 01:25:37.037 position:30% line:83% align:start
means nothing
unless you can share

it with the people you love.

01:25:39.038 --> 01:25:43.109 position:21% line:83% align:start
Because then, you're
really a winner.

01:25:43.175 --> 01:25:44.776 position:16% line:89% align:start
 You can say that again.
