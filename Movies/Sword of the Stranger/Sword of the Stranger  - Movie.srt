an extra hundred because

[LUO-LANG] The clothes
and sword belong to Tu-Si,

426
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:32,375
but it's not him.

427
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:34,583
Tu-Si's right arm
was once wounded,

428
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,541
and the cut went
right to the bone.

429
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:38,500
And there was no evidence
of such a mark

430
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:40,541
on the burnt corpse you found?

431
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:41,625
There wasn't.

Plus, there were
other inconsistencies.

433
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:46,250
Judging from the blood's
coagulation at the scene,

434
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:49,541
the first to die were Jin-Hai
and two Riben soldiers.

435
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:51,875
Jin-Hai died from a
single blow to the larynx,

436
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:54,166
obviously the work of
someone with great skill.

437
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,666
The wounds on the other corpses

438
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,083
suggested they died
by Tu-Si's hand.

439
00:30:58,166 --> 00:31:01,000
Jin-Hai's hair was cut,
but I believe Tu-Si did this

440
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:04,125
after Jin-Hai was killed
as proof of his death.

441
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:05,250
Then what of Tu-Si?

442
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:06,791
Was he attacked by the samurai?

443
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:08,541
Is that what you're suggesting?

444
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:09,958
Most likely.

445
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:12,000
So that means Tu-Si must be--

446
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:13,583
They want us to think he's dead,

447
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:16,583
which must mean he's still
alive and being held captive.

But I was the only survivor.

[SOLDIER F]
What is that?

799
00:50:14,666 --> 00:50:17,000
He started up about
two hours ago.

800
00:50:17,083 --> 00:50:20,875
[TU-SI groaning]

801
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:26,833
[VILLAGER B] So in the end,
you didn't get the reward?

802
00:50:26,916 --> 00:50:29,666
[OLD MAN] Not only did
I come away empty handed,

803
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:32,333
but the samurai
accused me of lying!

804
00:50:32,416 --> 00:50:34,666
He was extremely mad at me...

805
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,750
Thought they'd kill me.

806
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:39,833
Like I say, there's no
such thing as easy money.

807
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,416
Looks like we'll get
some snow tomorrow.

808
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,958
[VILLAGER B]
Uh... What're ya saying?

809
00:50:50,041 --> 00:50:51,750
It's a beautiful sunny day.

810
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:52,916
[OLD MAN]
Look!

811
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,958
Even though the west sky
is partly cloudy,

812
00:50:56,041 --> 00:50:58,833
you can see
Mount Akaike clearly.

813
00:50:58,916 --> 00:51:01,166
That's a sign
it's going to snow.

814
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:03,416
[TU-SI groaning]
My drug...

815
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,041
[SOLDIER G]
That seems to be last of it.

816
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:08,083
[TU-SI groaning]

817
00:51:11,375 --> 00:51:12,583
What is it?

818
00:51:12,666 --> 00:51:16,000
It's a drug that
he's been taking.

819
00:51:16,083 --> 00:51:19,208
[ITADORI] So this is what
happens when it wears off.

820
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:20,750
Put him out of his misery.

821
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,500
[LORD AKAIKE]
Xian medicine?

822
00:51:28,583 --> 00:51:30,333
[ITADORI] According to
the Chinese we captured,

823
00:51:30,416 --> 00:51:32,000
they came here in search
of an ingredient

824
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:33,833
in order to make
the Xian medicine,

825
00:51:33,916 --> 00:51:35,750
an elixir that
brings immortality.

826
00:51:35,833 --> 00:51:38,708
[LORD AKAIKE]
Hm... Immortality, you say?

827
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:52,708
[ITADORI]
It was prophesized by

828
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:55,625
a trusted eunuch
in the Ming court.

829
00:51:55,708 --> 00:51:58,500
[LORD AKAIKE]
So that's how it all began.

830
00:51:58,583 --> 00:51:59,833
[ITADORI]
Yes...

831
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:02,125
If you follow the divination
of a certain priest,

832
00:52:02,208 --> 00:52:05,125
it's possible to
attain eternal life.

833
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:07,583
A medicine for
immortality can be created

834
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,208
with the blood of a living child

835
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:12,875
chosen through prophecy
once each century.

836
00:52:12,958 --> 00:52:15,166
The Emperor believed this
and ordered his men

837
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,750
to find the child.

838
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:19,166
[LORD AKAIKE] And they crossed
the ocean to find him?

839
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:20,666
[ITADORI]
Yes.

840
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:23,750
The altar at the fortress,
a mechanism to tell the time,

841
00:52:23,833 --> 00:52:26,291
everything's been done in order
to collect the youth's blood

842
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:27,875
as set out in the prophecy.

843
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:29,500
[LORD AKAIKE laughs]

844
00:52:29,583 --> 00:52:33,041
A chosen one...
every hundred years...

845
00:52:33,125 --> 00:52:34,291
I don't know...

846
00:52:34,375 --> 00:52:36,875
Is there even such a thing
as immortality?

847
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:39,416
[LORD AKAIKE]
Who cares? It doesn't matter.

848
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,750
The only thing that matters is

849
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:43,083
that you couldn't even buy
this child they're after

850
00:52:43,166 --> 00:52:45,250
with 10,000 gold gan.

851
00:52:45,333 --> 00:52:46,791
Then what's our next step?

852
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:48,625
[LORD AKAIKE]
Why, that's obvious.

853
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:50,208
Find the child first,

854
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:52,875
then rid ourselves
of those wretched Ming.

855
00:52:52,958 --> 00:52:55,583
My Lord, may I remind you
that they're the only ones

856
00:52:55,666 --> 00:52:57,958
that know what
the child looks like.

857
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,291
And they've been
roaming around the area

858
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:01,583
without a guide since yesterday.

859
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:04,083
[LORD AKAIKE] I've already
taken appropriate measures.

860
00:53:04,166 --> 00:53:06,500
Besides, they'll eventually
come crying to us,

861
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:07,750
saying they can't get anywhere

862
00:53:07,833 --> 00:53:09,750
without knowledge
of our language.

863
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:10,916
No matter what they try,

864
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,250
the bottom line is
they're in our country.

865
00:53:20,625 --> 00:53:23,083
You must be lonely
without Luo-Lang around.

866
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:24,541
[MAN D]
Hm?

867
00:53:24,625 --> 00:53:27,625
You're like a wife who's
recently lost her husband.

868
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:28,958
Don't be ridiculous.

869
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:31,125
The only reason
I might look unhappy is

870
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,208
that I don't have
my hawk at my side.

871
00:53:33,291 --> 00:53:35,416
[WOMAN A]
You're good at making excuses.

872
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:40,750
If we fail tomorrow,

873
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:43,541
we're stuck in this
country for another year.

874
00:53:43,625 --> 00:53:47,708
Still upset over your clash
with Lord Bai-Luan yesterday?

875
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,000
Nonsense.

876
00:53:49,083 --> 00:53:50,791
The only thing
I'm concerned about

877
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:54,250
is finding the man
who took Jin-Hai's life.

878
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:55,708
[WOMAN B] 
Really?

879
00:53:55,791 --> 00:53:58,541
How like you, caring more
about some flagrant soldier

880
00:53:58,625 --> 00:54:01,041
than the Emperor's directives.

881
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:03,666
[LUO-LANG] Oh, I'll follow
the Emperor's directives,

882
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,833
even if they come
through a dubious priest

883
00:54:05,916 --> 00:54:07,791
or the whim of a prophet.

884
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,833
Right now, the Lord's
army is laying in wait.

885
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:14,833
But starting tomorrow,
I'll be leading them.

886
00:54:14,916 --> 00:54:16,583
My commands will keep you busy.

887
00:54:16,666 --> 00:54:18,250
[YOUNG SOLDIER] It's my honor
to serve under you.

888
00:54:18,333 --> 00:54:20,583
--[music plays]
--[BOTH] Huh?

[music continues]

890
00:54:31,541 --> 00:54:34,583
I wonder if it's the Princess
playing that music.

Hmph.

She's well beyond your reach.

894

Huh?

895
00:54:40,583 --> 00:54:43,125
Never set your aspirations so
high that they're unattainable.

896
00:54:43,208 --> 00:54:44,458
Take my word.

Hey.

Hm?

[KOTARO] You're a pretty
good swordsman, aren't you?

904
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:37,416
[NO NAME]
What about it?

905
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,875
[KOTARO] Instead of only
teaching me how to ride a horse,

906
00:55:39,958 --> 00:55:42,125
you should've taught me
how to fight with a sword.

907
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,291
[NO NAME]
What good would that do you?

908
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:46,541
Well, what do you think?

909
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:49,166
It would come in very
handy when I'm older.

910
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:52,541
You can count on swords;
they're dependable.

911
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:54,166
[NO NAME]
Dependable?

912
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:58,125
Yeah, I guess I used to think
the same thing when I was a kid.

913
00:55:58,208 --> 00:55:59,875
You don't think that anymore?

You have a lot of nightmares.

919
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,333
So how come you're awake?

[thunder crashes]

I can't sleep with

Yeah, I guess I don't blame you.

Hey, I know a way to
stop having nightmares.

924
00:56:34,708 --> 00:56:36,291
Want me to show you how?

925
00:56:38,791 --> 00:56:40,708
[KOTARO] It helps to curl up
with something you love,

926
00:56:40,791 --> 00:56:42,458
and think good thoughts.

927
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,833
That's what I always do.

928
00:56:46,916 --> 00:56:48,500

Master Bai-Luan?

931
00:57:07,416 --> 00:57:08,458
[BAI-LUAN]
Huh?

932
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,875
[MAN D] I saw your lamp
was still burning...

933
00:57:11,958 --> 00:57:14,500
I've been too busy
thinking about something.

Feng-Wu...

935
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:19,166
If you were given immortality,

00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:22,291
what would you do?
How would you spend your life?

937
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:23,916
[FENG-WU]
I have one goal--

938
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,500
To live with pride...

939
00:57:25,583 --> 00:57:27,458
...even if my time is cut short.

940
00:57:27,541 --> 00:57:29,250
[BAI-LUAN]
You're still very young.

941
00:57:29,333 --> 00:57:32,125
I've lived for
so many years now,

942
00:57:32,208 --> 00:57:35,458
I'm at the age where
I could die at any time.

943
00:57:35,541 --> 00:57:37,041
But the strange thing is,

944
00:57:37,125 --> 00:57:41,416
the longer I live, the deeper
is my desire to keep on living.

945
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,541
We've been searching
for the Xian medicine

for an awfully long time
under orders of the Emperor.

947
00:57:47,208 --> 00:57:48,916
And although I
completely understand

948
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,041
that it's not for my own use,

949
00:57:51,125 --> 00:57:52,500
somewhere in my heart,

950
00:57:52,583 --> 00:57:55,083
I feel I'm searching
for my own benefit.

01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:08,500
What is that?

1119
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:11,375
He served under this traitor.

1120
01:07:11,458 --> 01:07:14,875
I'm told he committed suicide
while the monk was unconscious.

1121
01:07:14,958 --> 01:07:16,041
Is that so?

1122
01:07:16,125 --> 01:07:17,625
We'll return to
the castle at once.

1123
01:07:17,708 --> 01:07:20,541
The rest of you will remain here
until the next orders are given.

1124
01:07:20,625 --> 01:07:21,750
[SOLDIER I]
I bring news!

1125
01:07:21,833 --> 01:07:22,875
[GROUP]
Huh?

1126
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:27,000
[SOLDIER I]
An urgent message!

1127
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:32,583
[ITADORI]
The Lord?!

1128
01:07:32,666 --> 01:07:33,916
[SOLDIER I] They came in unarmed
to catch him off guard,

1129
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,958
and that's when a
gang of them stormed in.

1130
01:07:36,041 --> 01:07:37,250
[ITADORI]
What about Isogai?

1131
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:38,458
And Fuchinobe?

1132
01:07:38,541 --> 01:07:40,791
[SOLDIER I]
Unfortunately, they were killed.

1133
01:07:40,875 --> 01:07:42,416
Does that mean
you merely watched

1134
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,208
as the Lord was abducted?!

1135
01:07:44,291 --> 01:07:46,166
They--They threatened his life!

1136
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:47,500
We could do nothing.

1137
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,458
[ITADORI] Why didn't
you chase after them?!

1138
01:07:49,541 --> 01:07:51,208
They poisoned every
one of the horses,

1139
01:07:51,291 --> 01:07:53,333
so none were in any
shape to go in pursuit.

1140
01:07:53,416 --> 01:07:55,375
We have troops from
Wataoki and Kawashi

1141
01:07:55,458 --> 01:07:57,125
heading to the
fortress as we speak.

1142
01:07:57,208 --> 01:07:58,541
But being foot soldiers,

1143
01:07:58,625 --> 01:08:00,708
the soonest they could
possibly arrive is this evening.

1144
01:08:00,791 --> 01:08:01,875
What's that?

1145
01:08:01,958 --> 01:08:03,708
You said troops from
Wataoki and Kawashi?

1146
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:04,625
[SOLDIER I]
Yes, sir.

1147
01:08:04,708 --> 01:08:06,583
As it stands, Master Itadori,

1148
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:08,333
you're the only commander left.

1149
01:08:08,416 --> 01:08:11,291
The Princess ordered
that you be left in charge.

1150
01:08:11,375 --> 01:08:15,041
I came as fast as I
could to report the news.

1151
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:18,875
Jurota, get horses,
armor, and helmets--

1152
01:08:18,958 --> 01:08:21,000
enough gear to outfit
the two of us.

1153
01:08:21,083 --> 01:08:22,375
[JUROTA]
Understood.

1154
01:08:22,458 --> 01:08:23,916
[ITADORI]
We're changing plans.

1155
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,916
You men return to the castle.

1156
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,208
Jurota and I will head
to the Shishine Fortress.

1157
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:42,500
[SHUI-CHEN]
While we're here buying time,

1158
01:08:42,583 --> 01:08:45,958
you will travel along the
ridge and cross the border.

1159
01:08:46,041 --> 01:08:47,875
[WOMAN A] The boy
certainly gave us trouble.

1160
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:50,375
Not long from now,
we'll be done.

1161
01:08:50,458 --> 01:08:51,625
We just get through this,

1162
01:08:51,708 --> 01:08:54,625
and we can say goodbye
to this country.

1163
01:08:54,708 --> 01:08:55,708
[WOMAN A]
You're right.

1164
01:08:55,791 --> 01:08:58,208
We can finally return
to our own soil.

1165
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:06,791
That's yours, isn't it?

1166
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:10,666
The stranger who came after us
from the Mangaku Temple had it.

1167
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:12,375
Then what became of him?

1168
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:15,083
I'm not convinced you could
have handled him on your own.

1169
01:09:15,166 --> 01:09:18,625
Hmph. I used this to
send him to his grave.

1170
01:09:22,583 --> 01:09:25,833
[TOBIMARU whimpers]

1171
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:31,708
This might belong
to your master.

1172
01:09:31,791 --> 01:09:33,583
But don't bite me if I'm wrong.

1173
01:10:28,166 --> 01:10:29,208
[KOTARO gasps]

1174
01:10:42,791 --> 01:10:46,166
Jurota, you're familiar with the
paths in this area, aren't you?

1175
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:49,166
There is a shortcut, but I'm not
sure the horses will make it.

1176
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:51,291
We'll ride them into
the ground if need be.

1177
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:52,458
Quickly!

1178
01:11:32,458 --> 01:11:33,625
You see this?

1179
01:11:33,708 --> 01:11:35,708
When this hand points
to the heavens,

1180
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:37,916
your soul will leave your body,

1181
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,208
and only the
blood flowing in you

1182
01:11:40,291 --> 01:11:43,291
will live on for
the sake of our emperor.

1183
01:11:43,375 --> 01:11:46,291
There could be no greater honor.

1184
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:55,583
[PRINCESS]
Are you worried about him?

1185
01:11:55,666 --> 01:11:56,750
Not especially.

1186
01:11:56,833 --> 01:11:58,250
Well, don't worry.

1187
01:11:58,333 --> 01:12:00,083
Shogen used to be a ronin,

1188
01:12:00,166 --> 01:12:02,375
but I hear he is
very loyal to the Lord

1189
01:12:02,458 --> 01:12:04,125
and highly trustworthy.

1190
01:12:04,208 --> 01:12:07,333
I'm sure he'll do
everything to rescue him.

01:12:12,291 --> 01:12:13,416
[ITADORI]
Will it succeed?

All of us from

have been practically raised

by you, Master Itadori.

1195
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:19,541
There is no reason to worry.

[ITADORI]
I'm counting on you!

Buy us some time by using
the Lord as a shield.

to look to your hearts

1219
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:07,666
and make a critical decision.

1220
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:10,833
Will you follow me?
Or the dead Lord?

Unlike our perception
of an emperor,

to these men, their lord
is no more than a man
