(people speaking in foreign languages)

12
00:01:11,982 --> 00:01:13,130
- [Man] It's an American dream!

13
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,420
- [Announcer] American, Nicholas Doris,

14
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,070
an average athlete at best, considering retirement,

15
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,710
has just vaulted into world history!

16
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,220
Seven meters, an Olympic record!

17
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,020
An incredible story!

18
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,200
Yesterday, he was a nobody from nowhere.

19
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,010
Today, he explodes intro front page headlines.

20
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,780
An overnight, international hero

21
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,280
and an all-time sports legend.

22
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,610
What a day!

23
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,070
- The future arrives ahead of time

24
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,660
and what might tomorrow bring?

25
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,473
No one can be certain what's on that path.

26
00:01:40,473 --> 00:01:43,556
(ambient beat music)

27
00:01:50,404 --> 00:01:51,507

(beeping)

32
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:07,240
- [Announcer] Another record is shattered

33
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,913
in the Women's 100 Meter Dash!

34
00:02:08,913 --> 00:02:12,840
9.61 seconds, which betters even the men's record time!

35
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,220
We're seeing miracles here today!

36
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,140
These performances defy all attempts

37
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,110
at rational explanation!

38
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,856
- This is so incredible!

39
00:02:20,856 --> 00:02:22,697
I can't believe my eyes.

40
00:02:22,697 --> 00:02:26,730
You're missing the most exciting Olympic games in history!

41
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,660
It seems like every time I bat my eyes,

42
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,350
somebody has set a new world record and not just a record

43
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,290
but a fantastic record.

44
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,201
- Well, it's time for me to be on my way now, Pinoko.

45
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:37,034
- [Pinoko] Oh,

46
00:02:37,034 --> 00:02:39,650
how long do you think you'll be gone on this trip?

47
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,750
- [Man] Three days.

48
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,690
- I'll never understand how you can just ignore

49
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,190
a broadcast like this?

50
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,345
I've really got Olympic fever!

51
00:02:46,345 --> 00:02:47,360
- Hmmm.

52
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,070
I think you've just got a cold.

53
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,700
An antipyretic every six hours oughta bring that fever down.

54
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,076
- You're just making fun out me, aren't you?

55
00:02:55,076 --> 00:02:57,491
(ocean waves rumbling)

56
00:02:57,491 --> 00:02:58,710
Uh oh.

57
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,543
Sorry.

58
00:02:59,543 --> 00:03:01,223
- [Man] Page me if you have any problems.

59
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,853
And please,

60
00:03:04,853 --> 00:03:06,690
try and stay out of trouble while I'm gone, okay?

61
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,703
- Yes, sir, Roger Wilco.

62
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:13,466
(tires screeching)

63
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,230
- I still don't quite believe it yet.

64
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,577
- So how does it feel?

65
00:03:18,577 --> 00:03:19,715
- How do you think it feels?

66
00:03:19,715 --> 00:03:20,548
Great!

67
00:03:20,548 --> 00:03:21,433
- I guess that was a dumb question, huh?

68
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:23,105
- Come on, let somebody else ask her questions.

69
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:25,640
(crowd cheering)

70
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,010
- I can't believe what we're seeing!

71
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,450
It's impossible!

72
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,540
He's already covered 300 meters

73
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,990
and that's just in 25 seconds!

74
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,560
So here we go again, folks.

75
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,483
We're about to witness another superhuman record

76
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,633
by another superhuman athlete.

77
00:03:41,357 --> 00:03:44,619
(dramatic beat music)

78
00:03:44,619 --> 00:03:45,600
Let's face it,

79
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,663
this is a whole new breed of human beings we're seeing!

80
00:03:49,553 --> 00:03:52,220
(ominous music)

81
00:03:53,628 --> 00:03:57,270
(heartbeat thumping)

82
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,160
- [Surgeon] Heparin IV.

83
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,470
Three thousand units.

84
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,260
Circuit filled with lactate Ringer?

85
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,260
- [Man] Yes, doctor.

86
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,233
- [Surgeon] Scalpel.

87
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:05,066
- [Man] Scalpel.

88
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:09,070
(electric fizzling)

89
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,869
(squelching)

90
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:13,350
(beeping)

91
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,500
- [Surgeon] We are entering the Atrioventricular valve.

92
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,520
Locating the tumors

93
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,173
and excising the tumors.

94
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:24,418
(crowd cheering)

95
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:28,249
(somber beat music)

96
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:30,060
- [Announcer] Fantastic new records were set

97
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,859
in 13 events of this Olympiad.

98
00:04:32,859 --> 00:04:35,859
(fireworks booming)

99
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,820
These amazing young athletes

100
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,200
have achieved a spectacular mark in history

101
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,230
and they will long be remembered as the world moves

102
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,053
to the exciting new century.

103
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,913
- Dr. Black Jack.

104
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:01,100
I have brought you the professional service fee

105
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,210
that we agreed upon earlier.

106
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,150
Please accept it with our gratitude.

107
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,260
- A wire transfer deposit to my account

108
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,440
is what we agreed on.

109
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,870
- Please, take it.

110
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,960
- Understood.

111
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,130
This way there's no evidence that Center Hospital

112
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,410
has had any business with that rebel, Dr. Black Jack, right?

113
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,180
Well, I'm used to that.

114
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,013
Thank you.

115
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,470
- [Announcer] And so it was that a wall of records,

116
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,770
long considered impossible to surpass, was shattered.

117
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,530
Mankind's abilities have always been thought to have limits,

118
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,780
but now it appears that we will have to reconsider

119
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,250
our theoretical possibilities.

120
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,610
- It isn't just a theory but a self evident fact

121
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,590
that we are witnessing an evolutionary leap

122
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,070
of mankind into super mankind.

123
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,150
It boggles the mind when we try to imagine

124
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,300
what sort of creature the 21st century man will be.

125
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,630
What we now consider to be superhuman abilities

126
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,995
may become mir ley average and commonplace.

127
00:06:00,995 --> 00:06:02,920
But wait just a minute.

128
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,100
What if the super humans are a whole new race

129
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,610
who could wind up dominating everyone else?

130
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,420
Whether these events are evolution

131
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,100
or genetically quirky development of a separate branch

132
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,900
in mankind's family tree,

133
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,140
the fundamental mystery remains.

134
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,633
What is causing it?

135
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:20,300

- Oh, where is it?

158
00:08:06,693 --> 00:08:09,049
I just saw it a second ago.

159
00:08:09,049 --> 00:08:10,173
Ah.

160
00:08:10,173 --> 00:08:12,840
(phone ringing)

161
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:16,933
Ugh, that phone again.

00:08:23,023 --> 00:08:25,190
Are you stone deaf, can't you hear that?

164
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,378
The telephone is ringing!

00:08:27,378 --> 00:08:28,872

00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,970
and indicate the amount of money you can afford to pay me.

172
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,347
I'll return your call when it is connivent.

173
00:08:42,593 --> 00:08:44,760
(beeping)

174
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,260
- [Woman In Car] My number is 0-8-8-0

175
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,100
2-5-8

176
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,670
7-1-0-1

177
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,400
I've prepared a blank check for you.

178
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,880
You may fill any amount you want for your fee.

179
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,420
Please return my call, doctor.

180
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,540
(beeping)

181
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,640
- She's called so often I've memorized her number.

182
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,580
It's 0-8-8-0

183
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,683
2-5-8-7-1-0-1.

184
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:09,379
Well, are you gonna call her?

185
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:12,850
(thunder rumbling)

186
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:13,990
I'll put it this way,

187
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,750
why haven't you called her?

188
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,160
- [Black Jack] She didn't leave her name

189
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,430
and she didn't tell me what her problem is.

190
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,280
So there's nothing to call her about.

191
00:09:22,546 --> 00:09:25,620
(thunder rumbling)

192
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,930
- [Jack Voiceover] It's been almost two years

193
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,033
since the Olympics.

194
00:09:33,325 --> 00:09:36,492
(intense piano music)

195
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:41,005
(crowd cheering)

196
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,700
Super humans continue to make headlines everyday.

197
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,320
In sports, in music,

198
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,216
literature, art, sciences,

199
00:09:54,216 --> 00:09:56,580
business and economics.

200
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,130
People with incredible talents

201
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,560
have been appearing everywhere in the world.

202
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,440
They come from all walks of life

203
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,040
with nothing in common, save for their superhuman abilities,

204
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,140
the source of which continues to be a mystery.

205
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,738
(ominous music)

206
00:10:17,056 --> 00:10:20,056
(airplane rumbling)

207
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,990
- [Man On Phone] Dr. Black Jack, this is Roger Siegel.

208
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,740
Do you remember me?

209
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,167
You operated on my little girl, Lisa, two years ago.

210
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:29,520
(heart monitor beeping)

211
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,937
(squelching)

212
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,690
She suffered a major relapse!

213
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,790
We're afraid we're gonna lose her!

214
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,623
Will you come?

215
00:10:37,623 --> 00:10:38,730
- It can't be a relapse.

216
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,280
That tumor was removed cleanly with no complications.

217
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,410
- [Roger] Please come, doctor!

218
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,940
My daughter is fighting for her life!

219
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,720
Please tell me you'll come!

220
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,885
- Yes, I will.

221
00:10:47,885 --> 00:10:50,968
(airplane whooshing)

222
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:55,889
(eerie music)

223
00:11:00,797 --> 00:11:01,678
(gasping)

224
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:03,450
- Oh, doctor, thank God you've come!

225
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,394
Please save our daughter!

226
00:11:05,394 --> 00:11:07,561
(moaning)

227
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,430
- Her heart's gone into fibrillation.

228
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,290
Her pulse has stopped.

229
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,320
CPR stimulants, Pinoko, quickly!

230
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,190
- Yes, sir.

231
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,450
Which one does he need?

232
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,597
I'll just take them all.

233
00:11:22,597 --> 00:11:23,750
Coming! Coming!

234
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,797
- Why wasn't this child taken to a hospital?

235
00:11:24,797 --> 00:11:27,730
Couldn't you see her condition had become critical?!

236
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,855
- She was in the hospital.

237
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,422
They released her yesterday.

238
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:33,010
She was doing so well.

239
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,280
She seemed to be recovering.

240
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,760
- [Black Jack] I reviewed her therapy reports,

241
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,830
she was doing just fine.

242
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,212
I hope you've called an ambulance, at least!

243
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:41,192
(gasping)

244
00:11:41,192 --> 00:11:42,967
(yelping)

245
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:45,840
(Black Jack huffing)

246
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,610
(crows squawking)

247
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,640
- Doctor, I believe in you.

248
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,850
I know you'll be able to save me.

249
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,147
Everybody is saying you're one of the superhuman people.

250
00:11:56,147 --> 00:11:58,305
(ominous music)

251
00:11:58,305 --> 00:12:00,472
(gasping)

252
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:05,086
(siren alarming)

253
00:12:05,086 --> 00:12:07,336
(thudding)

254
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:10,120
- The cause is till a mystery to me

255
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,490
but I'm sure it wasn't the tumor.

256
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,270
You can clearly see that from the x-ray

257
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,510
of her Atrioventricular valve.

258
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,410
- And I know from the biopsy that the tumor was malignant.

259
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,830
Something monstrous has happened to her

260
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,900
and we have no idea what it is.

261
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,540
- They brought her in with intestinal bleeding.

262
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,260
I got that stemmed, then her adrenal gland hypertrophy,

263
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,983
then hyperglycemia set in.

264
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,380
A week later, she suffered liver failure.

265
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,430
I've never heard of anything like this, doctor.

266
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,303
That delicate flower shriveled and died as we watched.

267
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,370
None of these things seem even remotely possible.

268
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,410
Lisa was a normal, healthy teenage girl.

269
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,050
- The entire situation is unexplainable

270
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,586
and unacceptable!

271
00:12:51,586 --> 00:12:54,336
(dramatic music)

272
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,483
I would your permission to assist at the autopsy, doctor.

273
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,731
(crying)

274
00:13:03,731 --> 00:13:06,314
(wind howling)

275
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,920
- [Jack Voiceover] The cause of death was heart failure

276
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,600
but the results of the autopsy were incredible.

277
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,396
All of her internal organs; heart, kidney, liver, pancreas,

278
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:21,160
looked like those of a warn out 90 year old woman.

279
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,980
When I performed surgery on Lisa two years earlier,

280
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,710
all of her organs were healthy,

281
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,160
pink and without pathologic findings.

282
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,550
How could a 14 year old girl age 75 years

283
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,460
in a period of just two years time?

284
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,300
I confirmed that her death was not related

285
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,870
to the tumor incision.

286
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,410
But we failed to solve the mystery

287
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,410
of what had happened to Lisa.

288
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,420
An autopsy is supposed to provide answers.

289
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,610
But this one wound up producing more questions

290
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,867
than we had when we began it.

291
00:13:48,867 --> 00:13:51,450
(somber music)

292
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:54,870
- Doctor, wait!

293
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,370
Please, doctor, just a moment!

294
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,390
This was Lisa's last painting.

295
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,880
My wife and I would like you to have it, doctor.

296
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,270
- I can't accept it.

297
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,687
I didn't save Lisa

298
00:14:05,687 --> 00:14:07,930
and I will make arrangements to have the fee you paid me

299
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,500
returned to you immediately.

300
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,830
- [Roger] Please, doctor,

301
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,730
we both believe Lisa would want the picture to go to you.

302
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,660
- I couldn't possibly accept your kind offer

303
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,570
after having failed you so utterly.

304
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,890
- [Roger] Please!

305
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,520
Let us to this for Lisa.

306
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,943
She loved you, doctor.

307
00:14:25,755 --> 00:14:26,588
- Thank you.

308
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,060
I know he really wants it.

309
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,470
It's a lovely painting

310
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,970
and we'll treasure it forever.

311
00:14:33,404 --> 00:14:35,231
(phone ringing)

312
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:37,981
(city commotion)

313
00:14:39,918 --> 00:14:41,350
- [Black Jack Voice Message] I'm not available right now.

314
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,780
If you're in need of medical care,

315
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,410
leave your name and number, describe your condition

316
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,785
and indicate how much you can afford to pay.

317
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:49,930
(ominous music)

318
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,182
- 0-8-8-0,

319
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:53,450
2-5-8-7-1-0-1.

320
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,860
I'll be waiting for your call.

321
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,080
If you must know, my name is Jo Carol.

322
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,810
I'm extending the most exciting and intriguing offer

323
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,973
you've ever received in your life.

324
00:15:01,973 --> 00:15:04,640
(ominous music)

325
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:08,601
(groaning)

326
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:11,351
(crowd cheering)

327
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,340
- As far back in my childhood as I can remember,

328
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,290
I was always a low achiever.

329
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,620
I guess my mother was right

330
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,530
when she said I had hidden talents.

331
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,837
I could never find them.

332
00:15:27,837 --> 00:15:30,587
(crowd laughing)

333
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,610
I had known little friends when I was a child.

334
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,410
I played alone in an empty warehouse on the waterfront.

335
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,110
When I was 12 years old, my mother began to travel

336
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,673
and left me to take care of myself.

337
00:15:43,673 --> 00:15:45,850
(whimpering)

338
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,980
But then the Olympics let me rise above my past.

339
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,290
Evenings like this with people like you

340
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,610
are making my whole life worthwhile.

341
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,130
So bring on the 21st century!

342
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,140
We're ready for it!

343
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,000
Super mankind's ready!

344
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,930
I thank you!

345
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,530
Thank you very much!

346
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,328
Now onward and upward!

347
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:05,908
(crowd cheering)

348
00:16:05,908 --> 00:16:07,900
(gigging)

349
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,169
(crowd applauding)

350
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:13,400
- Our super thanks to our super guest,

351
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,278
super mankind's own Nicholas Doris!

352
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:17,740
(television crowd applauding)

353
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,023
- He's sweating severely.

354
00:16:21,654 --> 00:16:22,650
- Wow.

355
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,196
- I'll be back tomorrow morning.

356
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:25,550
- Good night.

357
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,300
(crowd cheering)

358
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:33,519
(groaning)

359
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,900
(eerie music)

360
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,180
- [Host] Our panel is ready to answer

361
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,879
any questions you have about super mankind.

362
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:42,046
(gasping)

363
00:16:44,476 --> 00:16:47,143
(phone ringing)

364
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,340
- Yes?

365
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,470
- [Woman] We just received word.

366
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,100
He's been seen in New York.

367
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,490
He's been registered at the Royal Hotel the last three days.

368
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,870
- [Jo Carol] You're absolutely sure?

369
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,453
- [Woman] Yes.

370
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,570
(tires screeching)

371
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,280
- [Jo Carol] What's he doing here?

372
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,220
- [Woman] He has an SPB patient here.

373
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,090
I haven't found out the name yet.

374
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,140
According to our sources,

375
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,440
he's scheduled to perform surgery at eight o'clock tonight.

376
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,730
- At what hospital?

377
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,130
- [Woman] Killdeer Memorial.

378
00:17:16,008 --> 00:17:17,878
(booming)

379
00:17:17,878 --> 00:17:21,211
(heart monitor beeping)

380
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,900
- [Black Jack] Vital signs.

381
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,890
- Registering normal, doctor.

382
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,923
The pulse is 60 and the blood pressure 100 over 50.

383
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,330
- Excuse me, doctor, I see you're approaching the hilum.

384
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,143
Let me show you a new technique.

385
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,020
- [Black Jack] Are you out of your mind?

386
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,853
Don't interrupt me!

387
00:17:46,853 --> 00:17:48,800
You can seriously damage the lymph node.

388
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,770
In God's name, nurse, what are you doing?

389
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,110
- [Jo Carol] You're blocking the light, doctor.

390
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,953
Please!

391
00:17:54,952 --> 00:17:58,035
(ominous beat music)

392
00:18:03,815 --> 00:18:06,732
(foreboding music)

393
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,129
- Your scalpel technique is very impressive.

394
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:15,450
But what you did in there was absolutely unforgivable!

395
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,900
(water trickling)

396
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,813
I think you owe us all an explanation.

397
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,980
- First, I want you to explain

398
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,570
why you never return my phone calls.

399
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,403
- What?

400
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,085
- 0-8-8-0,

401
00:18:30,085 --> 00:18:30,918
2-5-8-7-1-0-1?

402
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:35,128
(ominous music)

403
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,513
I'm pleased to meet you at last, Dr. Black Jack.

404
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,900
Forgive my rude approach

405
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,620
but it seemed the only way to reach you.

406
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,040
- [Black Jack] All right, you have my attention now.

407
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,580
- I need your assistance desperately

408
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,940
and your price is no object.

409
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,793
- No thanks.

410
00:18:58,850 --> 00:18:59,960
- And that's it?

411
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,560
With no explanation at all?

412
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,410
- Whether I accept an offer or reject it,

413
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,413
I never explain myself to anyone.

414
00:19:05,413 --> 00:19:07,770
- Then we have a very difficult problem, doctor,

415
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,620
because your little girl has already seen fit

416
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,053
to accept our offer.

417
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:12,890
- What do you mean?

418
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,850
- One of my colleagues called her at your hotel

419
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,630
and invited her to take a little trip.

420
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,570
She as delighted, it was an offer she couldn't refuse.

421
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,420
- No.

422
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,337
Not Pinoko!

423
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:29,810
(distant police siren alarming)

424
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,040
- [Woman] Royal Hotel, good evening.

425
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,480
- [Black Jack] Room 3012, please.

426
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,363
- [Woman] One moment.

427
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:38,370
(phone dial tone buzzing)

428
00:19:40,668 --> 00:19:43,335
(phone ringing)

429
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,380
- Any chance you might change your mind, doctor?

430
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,213
- I will not!

431
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,580
- You can reach me day or night.

432
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,603
Pinoko is quite safe with us.

433
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,573
See you soon.

434
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,170
Don't wait too long, doctor.

435
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,826
The fate of super mankind is in your hands.

436
00:20:06,826 --> 00:20:09,326
(eerie music)

437
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,450
- Why does super mankind keep trying

438
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,178
to force its way into my life?

439
00:20:15,178 --> 00:20:18,261
(somber piano music)

440
00:20:25,702 --> 00:20:26,740
- You have company.

441
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,660
These gentlemen want to speak to you.

442
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,020
- I'm busy, Pinoko.

443
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,903
Tell them I'm not in.

444
00:20:32,903 --> 00:20:34,340
- He says he isn't in now.

445
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,034
Just miss him.

446
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,834
(laughing)

447
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:38,917
- Very funny.

448
00:20:39,998 --> 00:20:41,620
- Oh!

449
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,897
- [Thin Man] Fancy!
- [Fat Man] Yes, beautiful.

450
00:20:42,897 --> 00:20:44,550
- [Thin Man] Magnificent.
- [Fat Man] A masterpiece.

451
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,843
- [Thin Man] Doctor, please, you must let us talk to you.

452
00:20:46,843 --> 00:20:48,835
- [Fat Man] I'll pay you 250 thousand dollars

453
00:20:48,835 --> 00:20:51,470
for Lisa Siegel's last painting.

454
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:54,333
- 500 thousand, cash on the barrelhead.

455
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,160
- You're art dealers?

456
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,008
- That's right.

457
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:58,990
- [Thin Man] We've been trying to find you

458
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,370
ever since we learned that you possessed

459
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,910
Lisa Siegel's last painting.

460
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,580
- [Fat Man] She was a brilliant young artist

461
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,120
and she was a super mankind genius as well.

462
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,520
- [Jo Carol] The fate of super mankind is in your hands.

463
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,215
- I'm offing 750 thousand.

464
00:21:11,215 --> 00:21:13,540
- I'll raise it to a cool million.

465
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,360
- Doctor, I've gotta have it!

466
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,350
You understand?

467
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,435
- Hey, you!

468
00:21:17,435 --> 00:21:18,967
Who do you think you are?

469
00:21:18,967 --> 00:21:20,078
Hiiii

470
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:20,911
yaaah!

471
00:21:22,607 --> 00:21:25,080
(thudding)
(groaning)

472
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,970
- [Black Jack] Why are you offering

473
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,623
so much money for this picture?

474
00:21:30,193 --> 00:21:31,240
(groaning)

475
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,920
- All right, this is my final offer.

476
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,750
I'll give you any 10 old masters in my gallery

477
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,140
as an even trade for that precious last portrait

478
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,934
by the great super mankind artist of our time.

479
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:42,428
(gasping)

480
00:21:42,428 --> 00:21:45,511
(somber piano music)

481
00:21:51,981 --> 00:21:53,080
- [Black Jack] All right.

482
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,820
I'm ready to listen.

483
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,653
Talk to me.

484
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,710
- I went ahead and ordered for you.

485
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,584
Medium rare veal, right?

486
00:22:01,584 --> 00:22:04,417
(train whooshing)

487
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,550
(helicopter buzzing)

488
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,063
- [Jack Voiceover] Jo Carol is an extraordinary woman.

489
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,590
Surgeon, scientist and Chief Executive Officer

490
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,851
of the St. Joel Research Center.

491
00:22:16,851 --> 00:22:19,200
I still don't know what she wants from me

492
00:22:20,427 --> 00:22:23,653
or what any of this has to do with the super humans.

493
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,540
- So, welcome aboard.

494
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,530
Everyone at the center will be honored.

495
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,260
Come tomorrow morning at 11.

496
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:33,480
It'll be easier to explain after you've seen the patients.

497
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,573
- How many patients?

498
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,123
- 20.

499
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:39,780
But the chances are that's only the tip of the iceberg.

500
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,050
- [Black Jack] My only priority of Pinoko's safety.

501
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,900
I'll be there tomorrow morning at 11.

502
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,750
- [Jo Carol] I'll say goodnight, then.

503
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,340
Unless you have any questions.

504
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,090
- I can wait till tomorrow with my questions

505
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,380
but you better be ready with some answers.

506
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,380
(somber beat music)

507
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,653
- Okay, security, that's him.

508
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:15,523
- This way.

509
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:19,029
(beeping)

510
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,810
- We won't start until your priority

511
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,810
has been confirmed to your satisfaction.

512
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,119
- Hi, it's me!

513
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:31,773
Here I am in Hawaii!

514
00:23:31,773 --> 00:23:33,460
What a wonderful surprise!

515
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,583
Thank you!

516
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:37,070
I wish you could've come too but I understand

517
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,970
you're on a very important assignment.

518
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,928
This is a terrific vacation!

519
00:23:42,928 --> 00:23:45,290
So, you don't have to worry about me.

520
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,487
I'm having a wonderful time!

521
00:23:47,487 --> 00:23:48,981
I'll be seeing you soon.

522
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:50,430
(giggling)

523
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,330
- Pinoko's fine.

524
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,880
Safe and in good hands.

525
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,597
And your two million dollar fee was deposited this morning.

526
00:23:55,597 --> 00:23:56,963
(beeping)

527
00:23:56,963 --> 00:23:59,630
(steam hissing)

528
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,410
We'll begin your orientation here, doctor.

529
00:24:05,852 --> 00:24:07,500
(ominous music)

530
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,410
(gasping)

531
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,020
- [Black Jack] That's Nicholas Doris, isn't it?

532
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,853
- Yes.

533
00:24:11,853 --> 00:24:14,664
The gold medalist who set the new pole vaulting record.

534
00:24:14,664 --> 00:24:16,914
(groaning)

535
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,130
This is Jo Carol.

536
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,550
Show us the vitals and the fluid INO.

537
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,919
- [Man] Yes, ma'am, right away.

538
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:28,002
(ominous beat music)

539
00:24:33,578 --> 00:24:34,910
- Severe dehydration.

540
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,810
Any idea what's causing it?

541
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,210
- No but it's part of a syndrome

542
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,168
that accompanies spasm attacks.

543
00:24:40,168 --> 00:24:42,335
(yelling)

544
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,913
This is a more advanced example.

545
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,240
During his seizures, he bleeds about 50 CCs per minute.

546
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,133
He requires constant transfusion.

547
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,050
- [Black Jack] I presume he's one of the super humans too.

548
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,460
- He was a brilliant pianist.

549
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,510
A pure genius who's a legend in his own time.

550
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,970
He's been here six months.

551
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:03,803
We keep him alive

552
00:25:03,803 --> 00:25:05,923
but that's all we've been able to do for him.

553
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,592
Dysentery and anorexia and we can't find the cause.

554
00:25:19,592 --> 00:25:20,576
(gunshot booming)

555
00:25:20,576 --> 00:25:23,807
And, yes, she was another gold medal winner.

556
00:25:23,807 --> 00:25:26,340
(somber beat music)

557
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,980
Ellen, an ordinary little girl from Eastern Europe

558
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,330
who had never even played running games wit her friends

559
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,950
suddenly breaks a junior record at the age of 13.

560
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,703
At 15, she enters the Olympics.

561
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,990
Seeing her now, it's hard to imagine that this young girl

562
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,800
holds the hundred meter world record for women.

563
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,523
Very few men can equal her time.

564
00:25:48,934 --> 00:25:51,180
(ominous music)

565
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,300
You can see by her chart

566
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,560
how rapidly her condition has declined.

567
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,660
Again, we've managed to keep her alive, barely.

568
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,337
But it's a heartbreaking existence for her.

569
00:26:00,337 --> 00:26:03,004
(ominous music)

570
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:08,030
These people need you, doctor.

571
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,100
You represent their final, desperate hope.

572
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,550
Don't let them down.

573
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:14,079
Help us, Black Jack, help us.

574
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:16,829
(crowd cheering)

575
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,010
(fire rumbling)

576
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,980
- [Jack Voiceover] The superhuman boom of two years ago

577
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,050
seemed, at the time, to be an exciting promise

578
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,483
of a bright future for all mankind.

579
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:32,160
One by one, they fell victim to unexplainable,

580
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,080
catastrophic diseases.

581
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,570
They were brought here for study

582
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,690
and to make their last days as comfortable as possible.

583
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:41,553
Their mysterious affliction remained untreatable.

584
00:26:56,436 --> 00:26:58,979
(beeping)

585
00:26:58,979 --> 00:27:00,870
- When we first became aware of the situation,

586
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,150
the 40 original victims were brought here.

587
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,840
Since then, 17 of them have died.

588
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,530
After many intensive surveys,

589
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:10,930
we've found 1,230 people who possess talents

590
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:14,340
exceptional enough to be labeled superhuman.

591
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,440
One of those, incidentally,

592
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,690
was a young female patient you were treating.

593
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,580
- You mean Lisa Siegel?

594
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,082
- That's right.

595
00:27:22,082 --> 00:27:24,582
(eerie music)

596
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,153
This is your room.

597
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:31,180
- [Black Jack] You found more than a thousand super humans?

598
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,350
- Correct, why?

599
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,780
- And all of them are infected with this disease?

600
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,530
- Every single case that we've identified as super human

601
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,190
does have the disease and there could be thousands more

602
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,762
that we just haven't discovered yet.

603
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:45,180
(ominous music)

604
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,680
- I'm beginning to understand.

605
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,940
The condition we've been calling super human

606
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,540
is actually a deadly disease.

607
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,470
- We named it Moira Syndrome.

608
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,660
It's a progress, degenerative pathology

609
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,800
that spreads throughout the whole body.

610
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,690
Internal organs, nerves, blood and connective tissue

611
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,410
are all broken down.

612
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:05,740
We don't know how it's contracted or communicated.

613
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,790
We could be facing an epidemic.

614
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:10,070
- [Black Jack] Why did you name it Moira Syndrome?

615
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,440
- The ancient Greeks worshiped

616
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,770
an all-powerful god of destiny called Moira.

617
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,190
Needless to say, our research is being conducted

618
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,940
in total secrecy.

619
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,550
If word of this should get out,

620
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,470
it could create a hysterical panic

621
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,388
such as the world has never known before.

622
00:28:25,388 --> 00:28:28,680
(foreboding music)

623
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,810
- That's it, over there.

624
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:30,830
I wanna get a good luck at it.

625
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,373
- Don't you read the journals?

626
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,890
- Please welcome a new member to our team.

627
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:39,930
You've all heard of him.

628
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:42,120
Black Jack is his name.

629
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,180
His reputation is such that he needs no introduction.

630
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,990
Dr. Black Jack, Dr. Michener,

631
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:49,550
professor emeritus, Kent State University.

632
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,330
- I can't remember what year it was

633
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,220
when I first saw you work but it was at Johns Hopkins

634
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,730
and you performed the most brilliant

635
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,920
glioblastoma resection that I've ever witnessed.

636
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,420
- [Jo Carol] Bacteriology expert, Professor Elwes.

637
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,443
- I'm honored.

638
00:29:03,443 --> 00:29:05,510
- The honor is mine, professor.

639
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,820
- Our chief neurosurgeon, Dr. Takimoto,

640
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,953
with degrees from Tokyo and UCLA.

641
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:15,370
Dr. Eric Kadarie, on loan from the ELSA institute,

642
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,960
he'll be the neurosurgeon on your team.

643
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,670
Your anesthesiologist and author

644
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,040
of several highly respected textbooks,

645
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,273
Dr. Betty Moore.

646
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,750
- It's a privilege to meet you, doctor.

647
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,760
- Dr. Moore.

648
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,400
- Rumor has it, you're not legally licensed

649
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,920
and that you charge enormous fees for complicated surgery

650
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,450
which you're not certified to perform.

651
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:36,960
May we assume this is untrue?

652
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,893
- Assume nothing.

653
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,127
- You mean you don't deny it?

654
00:29:40,127 --> 00:29:42,120
(laughing)

655
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,968
(siren alarming)

656
00:29:44,968 --> 00:29:47,841
- [Man] We have an emergency in ward 14.

657
00:29:47,841 --> 00:29:50,038
- You can't make me stay here any longer!

658
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,404
I have to run!

659
00:29:51,404 --> 00:29:53,370
Let go of me! Let go!

660
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,980
- [Jack Voiceover] My first day here was marked by tragedy.

661
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,400
Female 100 meter gold medalist Ellen Shryer

662
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,053
expired this morning during a violent episode of hysteria.

663
00:30:02,936 --> 00:30:05,056
(groaning)

664
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,457
(gasping)

665
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:10,207
(dramatic music)

666
00:30:17,304 --> 00:30:19,554
(thudding)

667
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,000
With incredibly concentrated effort,

668
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,590
Ellen achieved her top speed

669
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:32,240
and managed to outrun her agony.

670
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,273
Her nightmare life ended at age 17.

671
00:30:39,577 --> 00:30:43,077
(pleasant carousel music)

672
00:30:44,711 --> 00:30:46,856
(rollercoaster whooshing)

673
00:30:46,856 --> 00:30:48,057
- Yeah! Yeah!

674
00:30:48,057 --> 00:30:49,257
(laughing)

675
00:30:49,257 --> 00:30:50,090
- Good.

676
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:50,953
Wave as you go by.

677
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,420
- Lots of extra caramel on the popcorn.

678
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,130
- Yes, ma'am, you got it.

679
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,210
- So, what did you do today, Pinoko?

680
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,670
- First we went to the zoo, then we went to Dolphin World

681
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,840
and now here we are in Fantasy World!

682
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,180
Fendy's afraid to take me on the Star Rocket though.

683
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,760
- Well then, would you like me to go

684
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,055
on the Star Rocket with you?

685
00:31:18,055 --> 00:31:18,975
- Mhmm.

686
00:31:18,975 --> 00:31:20,009
(whooshing)

687
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:22,342
(screaming)

688
00:31:25,182 --> 00:31:26,960
- [Jo Carol] Dr. Black Jack sends you his love.

689
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,580
- [Pinoko] Is he happy with his work?

690
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,190
- He keeps his staff working very hard

691
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,770
but they all like him a lot.

692
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,330
- [Pinoko] What about his meals and his laundry

693
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,960
and housekeeping?

694
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,060
- Don't you worry.

695
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,550
Our people are taking care of his every need.

696
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,383
- Good.

697
00:31:39,383 --> 00:31:40,870
- [Jo Carol] It's a very difficult assignment

698
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,490
and he's working really hard

699
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:43,880
but he thinks about you all the time.

700
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,440
- I think every now and then it's probably good for him

701
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,690
to have to work without me there to help him.

702
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:51,530
It wouldn't do for Dr. Black Jack

703
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,416
to become overly dependent.

704
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:54,749
(Jo Carol and Pinoko laughing)

705
00:31:54,749 --> 00:31:57,188
- [Jo Carol] Oh, Pinoko.

706
00:31:57,188 --> 00:31:59,290
(printer buzzing)

707
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,590
- Here it is, Dr. Black Jack,

708
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:03,233
the summary report on Ellen Shryer's autopsy.

709
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,890
- Can you show me a detailed workup on the liver?

710
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:08,723
- Yes.

711
00:32:12,562 --> 00:32:14,450
(beeping)

712
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,840
- [Black Jack] Enlarge the Porta Hepatis.

713
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,490
(beeping)

714
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:22,320
- The same accelerated failure in the other major organs.

715
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,960
Well, they just shut down and go out of business.

716
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,930
We might have kept her alive another couple of weeks

717
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,423
but it's debatable.

718
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,680
- [Betty] Here's here adrenal gland.

719
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,590
You can see the progress of overall aging

720
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,893
but the cortex is unusually enlarged.

721
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,593
Necrosis of the intestinal mucosal had already begun.

722
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,350
- She was just rotting away.

723
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,360
We couldn't stop it.

724
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,433
All we could do was slow it down a little.

725
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,440
- Let me see the brain.

726
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,590
- [Betty] I should be able to call up

727
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,233
a copy of the MRI scan.

728
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,700
- I'm told you have that renegade, Black Jack,

729
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,490
working for us now.

730
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:04,760
- Yes, we were extremely fortunate to acquire his services.

731
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,020
- That remains to be seen.

732
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,260
I don't like geniuses, they're too independent.

733
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,060
The only people I want working on this project

734
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,440
are people I can control.

735
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,330
- Don't worry, I'll control him.

736
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,240
- You know, there's been a lot of new activity

737
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,100
within the MSJ.

738
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,570
They've gained major support for a direct attack on us.

739
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,290
We don't have much time.

740
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:26,185
- Once we find the cure we'll have nothing to fear.

741
00:33:26,185 --> 00:33:27,420
(ominous music)

742
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:31,160
- Don't underestimate the MSJ, they're very powerful.

743
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,710
- I'll push our team to work faster.

744
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:36,460
- Moving too fast is what got us into this trouble, Jo.

745
00:33:38,271 --> 00:33:40,938
(ominous music)

746
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,410
- Who's funding this project?

747
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:45,720
- Nobody told you?

748
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,440
Welcome to the Brane Pharmaceutical Company, doc.

749
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,720
The land, the building and all the fancy equipment

750
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,920
belong to Brane.

751
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,750
All the doctors, scientists and technicians, except you,

752
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,300
are on Brane's payroll.

753
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,220
You might say we're just one, big happy family,

754
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,840
typical of every American family,

755
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,790
including the fact that we're almost totally dysfunctional.

756
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,060
And the woman you call Jo Carol?

757
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,570
She's the adopted daughter of the company's owner.

758
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,020
Her real name Jo Carol Brane.

759
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,580
She runs this operation.

760
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,413
And why not?

761
00:34:14,413 --> 00:34:16,584
Someday it's all gonna be hers anyway.

762
00:34:16,584 --> 00:34:19,540
(tires screeching)

763
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,060
She has a mega gigabit mind

764
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,670
and her heart is carved out of cold marble.

765
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,903
She was born for business management.

766
00:34:26,903 --> 00:34:29,236
(screaming)

767
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:37,203
Our first task will be to get that arrhythmia under control.

768
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,210
Prepare the patient for thoracotomy.

769
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,410
- [Man] Yes, sir.

770
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,110
- [Eric] Dr. Black Jack will open.

771
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,620
- [All] May God be with all of us.

772
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,660
- [Eric] Anesthesia?

773
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,710
- Patient ready, you may proceed, doctor.

774
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,866
- We all wish you good luck, doctor.

775
00:34:51,866 --> 00:34:53,233
(heart monitor beeping)

776
00:34:53,233 --> 00:34:54,885
(rumbling)

777
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:57,052
(booming)

778
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:06,394
(ambient music)

779
00:35:12,322 --> 00:35:13,920
(door closing)

780
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,970
- I've been thinking.

781
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,800
This is only a hypothesis

782
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,908
but it might point to the source of this Moira disease.

783
00:35:21,908 --> 00:35:24,491
(somber music)

784
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,710
Our patients share one common denominator,

785
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,300
the fact that they're all so-called \"super humans.\"

786
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,203
Average people who suddenly acquire super abilities.

787
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,670
In the mechanics of the body, what's the most likely system

788
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,130
in which such transformation might happen?

789
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,830
I quickly came to the conclusion that the logical candidate

790
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,180
would be the limbic system.

791
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,790
The hormone endorphin is an intracerebral narcotic

792
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:50,710
that could stimulate extremely intense concentration.

793
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:54,430
Over secretion might possible result in unusual abilities.

794
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:57,040
Endorphin is secreted from the pituitary system

795
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,493
of the hypothalamus.

796
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,740
Think of the super human's body as a machine

797
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:05,230
whose power has been turned up way beyond its normal limits.

798
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,190
It's the kind of concentration that would allow

799
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,620
a 90 pound mother to lift a half tone automobile

800
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,720
in order to rescue her child.

801
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,260
(ominous beat music)

802
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,480
Continuous over secretion of this stimulant,

803
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,440
over a period of years, could well cause

804
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,640
such systemic burnouts as we've been seeing.

805
00:36:22,913 --> 00:36:26,090
I think the problem stems from the pituitary system.

806
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,963
Anyway, that's my hypothesis.

807
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,610
- So do you wanna concentrate your research

808
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:32,230
on the brain from now on?

809
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,230
- Yes, that's right.

810
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:35,830
- You've been here a week

811
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:38,060
and already you have a possible answer.

812
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,433
You are incredible.

813
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,083
- It's still just a theory.

814
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,310
- I'll schedule a full staff meeting

815
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,490
for early tomorrow morning.

816
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,880
- Wait.

817
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,690
Why wasn't I told that this laboratory

818
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,760
is actually a commercial company?

819
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,110
I've learned that it's an enterprise

820
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,543
of Brane Pharmaceuticals.

821
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,530
- To begin with, let me assure you

822
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,740
that this is not a commercial enterprise.

823
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,980
Brane Pharmaceuticals created this research center

824
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,480
purely as a public service.

825
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,363
It's a multimillion dollar act of humanitarianism.

826
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,290
- You have an elegant hypothyrosis but it can not be proven.

827
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:15,800
Such an examination would require surgery,

828
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,960
brainstem surgery where one slit means death.

829
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,120
- Yes, we're very fortune to have Dr. Black Jack

830
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,060
here with us to perform the surgery.

831
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,760
- Had the patient been selected?

832
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,240
If not, are you open to entertain

833
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,093
any recommendations we might suggest?

834
00:37:29,228 --> 00:37:31,961
(somber beat music)

835
00:37:31,961 --> 00:37:35,128
(cafeteria commotion)

836
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,910
- Well, Dr. Black Jack, I see you've scheduled your surgery

837
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,160
for tomorrow morning at eight.

838
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,170
The patient will be Nicholas Doris, won't it?

839
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:47,170
- [Black Jack] Yes, that's right.

840
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,003
- I think you better look

841
00:37:48,003 --> 00:37:50,070
at this computer disk immediately, Black Jack.

842
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,919
(wind howling)

843
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:57,336
(construction commotion)

844
00:38:04,403 --> 00:38:07,070
(phone ringing)

845
00:38:14,152 --> 00:38:14,990
[Jo] This is Jo Brane.

846
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,160
Shut down the operation.

847
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:17,993
- What?

848
00:38:17,993 --> 00:38:19,490
You can't be serious, Miss Brane.

849
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:21,300
- Keep a skeleton crew on hand for maintenance.

850
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,220
Send everybody else home.

851
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,750
Repeating my order, shut down the refinery at once.

852
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:29,799
And I want everyone out by the end of the day, understood?

853
00:38:29,799 --> 00:38:31,040
- [Worker] Yes, ma'am.

854
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,700
When can we reopen?

855
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,740
- I'm afraid I'll have to let you know later.

856
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,564
It could be anywhere from a month to a half a year.

857
00:38:37,564 --> 00:38:40,147
(horn blowing)

858
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,730
- [Announcer] Attention, stop all work immediately!

859
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,963
I repeat, stop all work immediately!

860
00:38:46,963 --> 00:38:50,028
(ominous music)

861
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:52,611
(wind howling)

862
00:38:58,138 --> 00:39:00,805
(steam hissing)

863
00:39:05,098 --> 00:39:07,300
- Hotter, hotter,

864
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,661
much hotter.

865
00:39:08,661 --> 00:39:11,411
(pleasant music)

866
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,460
- Hello, Mr. Doris, can you hear me?

867
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,200
I'm Dr. Black Jack, I'll be your surgeon.

868
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,930
- Will I ever be able to participate

869
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,433
in track and field again?

870
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,240
You're looking at the world record holder

871
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,680
in the pole vaulting event

872
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,150
but now I can't even hold the pole in my grip.

873
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,260
I soared through the air like an eagle!

874
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,800
I once cleared seven meters

875
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,670
and now I can't get out of bed without assistance!

876
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,530
What a cruel joke.

877
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:50,940
I've gone through seven major surgeries.

878
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,200
What am I, some kind of guinea pig?

879
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,520
- I understood you volunteered for this operation.

880
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,640
Was I wrong?

881
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,060
- No, that's right.

882
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,920
But I did negotiate a few stipulations.

883
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,830
If you discover I can't be cured,

884
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:05,310
I want you to erase my memory.

885
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,680
If I can forget what I was,

886
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,706
it might be easier for me to accept what I've become.

887
00:40:09,706 --> 00:40:12,405
(laughing)

888
00:40:12,405 --> 00:40:14,500
- You also stipulated that your family

889
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,650
is not to be notified.

890
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:17,330
Do you mind telling me why?

891
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,770
- I don't want them to see me.

892
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:21,550
This is not how I want to be remembered.

893
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:24,740
Back home, they put up a statue to remember me by.

894
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,793
That's how I want them to think of me.

895
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:30,869
(water rumbling)

896
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:33,120
- By the way, Black Jack,

897
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,000
have you looked at that computer disk I gave you?

898
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,770
- I'll take a look at it now.

899
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:39,520
(birds flapping)

900
00:40:43,551 --> 00:40:45,671
(computer chiming)

901
00:40:45,671 --> 00:40:48,171
(saw buzzing)

902
00:40:56,552 --> 00:40:59,469
(computer beeping)

903
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:01,890
- What are you doing?

904
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:04,598
The trauma will cause the patient to stop breathing!

905
00:41:04,598 --> 00:41:07,515
(flatline beeping)

906
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,460
- I've failed again!

907
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,880
This is insane, it can't be done!

908
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,520
- [Jo] Prepare the next patient immediately in OR-5.

909
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,353
- Yes, ma'am.

910
00:41:16,353 --> 00:41:17,850
- Will not do this any longer!

911
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:21,230
Experimenting on human beings is inexcusable!

912
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,680
- You will continue.

913
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,590
The information we need can only be obtained

914
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,271
through living specimens.

915
00:41:26,271 --> 00:41:28,940
(foreboding music)

916
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,370
- [Jack Voiceover] The data disc Eric had lifted

917
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,060
from the project's top secret files

918
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:35,800
laid bare a horrifying history, one failure after another.

919
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,100
Presumably, these were the super humans

920
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,810
whose names had been dropped from the original lists

921
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:43,020
and whose medical records were no longer on file

922
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,781
at the research center.

923
00:41:44,781 --> 00:41:47,698
(foreboding music)

924
00:41:58,242 --> 00:42:00,825
(rain pouring)

925
00:42:04,007 --> 00:42:07,621
(engine rumbling)

926
00:42:07,621 --> 00:42:10,482
(helicopter buzzing)

927
00:42:10,482 --> 00:42:13,399
(tires screeching)

928
00:42:14,594 --> 00:42:16,739
(groaning)

929
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:19,489
(siren alarming)

930
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:23,180
- Do as your told and you won't get hurt!

931
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,970
- Security monitor, what's going on out there?

932
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:28,780
- This is the MSJ, Miss Brane.

933
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,700
We're assuming possession of this research center

934
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,040
on behalf of human rights!

935
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,440
Do not attempt to resist us!

936
00:42:34,841 --> 00:42:36,872
(thudding)

937
00:42:36,872 --> 00:42:39,670
(rain pouring)

938
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:41,550
- Did you find that computer disc interesting,

939
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,383
Dr. Black jack?

940
00:42:42,383 --> 00:42:45,050
(gasping)

941
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:46,840
I represent the MSJ.

942
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,940
We're defenders of the weak,

943
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,334
whose rights are being violated.

944
00:42:49,334 --> 00:42:52,540
We take action against the abuses of cooperate power.

945
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,110
We have vowed to destroy corruption

946
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:57,083
and restore human dignity and decency to our society.

947
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,360
- Arrest the person in charge here.

948
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,637
Her name is Jo Carol Brane.

949
00:43:03,637 --> 00:43:06,300
(suspenseful music)

950
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,133
- We have to hurry.

951
00:43:07,133 --> 00:43:09,020
These guys mean business.

952
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:09,853
- Don't move!

953
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:11,377
Hold it right there!

954
00:43:11,377 --> 00:43:12,373
(suspenseful music)

955
00:43:12,373 --> 00:43:13,573
(thudding)

956
00:43:13,573 --> 00:43:15,823
(groaning)

957
00:43:16,817 --> 00:43:19,400
(wind howling)

958
00:43:26,222 --> 00:43:28,972
(water bubbling)

959
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,658
- Attention doctors, nurses, technicians.

960
00:43:32,658 --> 00:43:36,040
Attention all employees of of St. Joe Research Center.

961
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,010
This project is now under the control,

962
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:40,030
command and protection of the MSJ.

963
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:42,120
There's no cause for alarm.

964
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,810
Our purpose is to put an end to the illegal and immoral

965
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:47,260
procedures that were being practiced here.

966
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:50,000
Many of you are sympathetic to our cause.

967
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,410
We will welcome your cooperation in helping us

968
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:54,000
to restore the medical integrity

969
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,140
of the center and its staff.

970
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,280
Those of you who chose not to cooperate

971
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,610
will be held in protective custody.

972
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:02,610
No one will be harmed.

973
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:05,960
This will be a temporary measure but until further notice,

974
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,890
all activities here will be conducted

975
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:10,620
under strict MSJ supervision.

976
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:11,563
That is all.

977
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:14,710
- So, Dr. Black Jack,

978
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:16,750
now that you've seen the Brane Company's secret files,

979
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:19,130
may we assume your support and cooperation?

980
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:21,090
I'm sure you must be sympathetic with our aims

981
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:23,561
and we could certainly use your help.

982
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:26,311
(city commotion)

983
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,833
- Jo Carol,

984
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:29,666
7-1-0-1.

985
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:33,560
Despite having warned you about the MSJ,

986
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,020
you did not take proper precautions.

987
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,480
- I thought I had already prepared

988
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,230
for the worst possible case scenario

989
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:42,220
by having the refinery shut down temporarily.

990
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,480
- According to my sources,

991
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,810
it turned out there were quite a few MSJ members

992
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:47,630
among that blue ribbon staff that you hired.

993
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:49,790
- My security force could've prevented the takeover

994
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:52,520
if the National Guard hadn't become involved.

995
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,470
Try pressuring the Governor into calling them off

996
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:56,160
if you really wanna help us.

997
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,060
- The troops are there to prevent escape!

998
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,480
It's a standoff with hostages involved!

999
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,264
If the MSJ discovers the real truth behind your project,

1000
00:45:03,264 --> 00:45:04,793
they can destroy us!

1001
00:45:04,793 --> 00:45:07,310
- They don't have enough information to figure it out

1002
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:10,530
and they'll never find enough evidence to prove anything.

1003
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:12,750
- You're relieved of duty, 7-1-0-1,

1004
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:15,312
and I'm shelving your project indefinitely.

1005
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:17,690
(helicopter whooshing)

1006
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:19,590
I can't say it any plainer, Jo Carol.

1007
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:20,820
You're fired!

1008
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,489
And I just hope I'll be able to cover up

1009
00:45:22,489 --> 00:45:25,273
the disgraceful debacle you're leaving me stuck with!

1010
00:45:25,273 --> 00:45:27,940
(ominous music)

1011
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:33,020
- This is Thomas Johnston, one of MSJ's leaders.

1012
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:35,180
He heads the North America region.

1013
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,950
- My specialty psychoanalysis.

1014
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:39,150
I own a private clinic in Vancouver.

1015
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:40,370
- Can we do this quickly?

1016
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,960
I'm scheduled to preform surgery at eight o'clock.

1017
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,550
- [Thomas] I understand, doctor.

1018
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:47,550
If I'm not mistaken, that's Nicholas Doris' CT.

1019
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:48,383
Am I correct?

1020
00:45:48,383 --> 00:45:49,216
- [Black Jack] That's right.

1021
00:45:49,216 --> 00:45:51,876
- Nicholas is vitally important to our cause, doctor.

1022
00:45:51,876 --> 00:45:55,910
Brane Pharmaceutical's franchises 400 hospitals worldwide.

1023
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:57,700
We've investigated their records.

1024
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,960
Every single victim of full-blown Moira disease

1025
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,560
turns out to have been a former patient

1026
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,230
at one of Brane's hospitals within the past five years.

1027
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,470
There's got to be a connection

1028
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:08,190
but none of the patients will talk about it.

1029
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:09,400
- They wouldn't?

1030
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,880
- Not one of them.

1031
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,950
All of them received some sort of procedure

1032
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:14,490
at one of Brane's hospitals.

1033
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:17,740
All of them subsequently developed super human abilities.

1034
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:20,353
Eventually, then, all of them fell victim to Moira.

1035
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,210
We've go to find out what they did to these people, doctor.

1036
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:26,730
But until one of these patients is willing to testify,

1037
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,880
the World Health Tribunal can't do a thing.

1038
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,780
We think Nicholas might cooperate

1039
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:34,630
but the surgery you're planning is very risky.

1040
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:37,600
None of the other patients would even let us interview them.

1041
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,760
But we believe they'll all open up

1042
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,253
if we can just get Nicholas to step forward.

1043
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:44,980
Nick's testimony is extremely important.

1044
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:47,130
- The man's life it what's important to me.

1045
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:49,620
Let's get to work.

1046
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,605
- [Betty] Yes, doctor.

1047
00:46:50,605 --> 00:46:52,229
- [Eric] Yes, sir.

1048
00:46:52,229 --> 00:46:54,979
(engine revving)

1049
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,280
- Are you there, Fendy?

1050
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,590
- [Fendy] Yes, ma'am.

1051
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:03,453
- You ready to move out, right away?

1052
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:05,380
- I stay ready.

1053
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,090
Just give the word.

1054
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:07,923
- Wrong!

1055
00:47:07,923 --> 00:47:10,090
- I made reservations for you on the last flight tonight.

1056
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:12,030
You can pick up the tickets at the airport.

1057
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,562
- [Finny] Will you be there, ma'am?

1058
00:47:13,562 --> 00:47:14,680
(Pinoko giggling)

1059
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,750
- I still have some thing to do, so I'll join you later.

1060
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,488
Just make sure you get a room with a view.

1061
00:47:19,488 --> 00:47:22,757
- [Pinoko] And it is finished!

1062
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,788
(tires screeching)

1063
00:47:24,788 --> 00:47:27,788
(suspenseful music)

1064
00:47:29,028 --> 00:47:30,335
(gunshots booming)

1065
00:47:30,335 --> 00:47:33,477
(tires screeching)

1066
00:47:33,477 --> 00:47:35,810
(splashing)

1067
00:47:37,155 --> 00:47:40,155
(suspenseful music)

1068
00:47:44,971 --> 00:47:47,638
(phone ringing)

1069
00:47:50,565 --> 00:47:53,898
(heart monitor beeping)

1070
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,180
- How's the brainwave reading?

1071
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:11,090
- Brainwave is normal, doctor.

1072
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:13,640
- [Jack Voiceover] Those experiments were concentrated here,

1073
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,450
between the peripheral hypothalamus and pituitary gland.

1074
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:19,050
If we're going to find any evidence,

1075
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:21,640
this is the most likely place for it.

1076
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,080
No reputable surgeon would risk taking a scalpel

1077
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,190
anywhere near the pituitary gland,

1078
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:29,300
unless he had absolute proof of a tumor lesion.

1079
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,810
I have to exsert 150 percent of my powers of concentration

1080
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:34,250
while working in this area

1081
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:37,003
because an error of even one millimeter could be fatal.

1082
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:42,280
This is a rare opportunity for the young doctors looking on.

1083
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,930
They may never witness another operation

1084
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:45,343
like this in their lifetime.

1085
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:49,840
(ominous beat music)

1086
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,630
No matter how skilled the surgeon,

1087
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:54,920
this type of procedure is always a calculated gamble.

1088
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,143
Nobody is more aware of that than me.

1089
00:48:58,563 --> 00:49:01,880
(eerie music)

1090
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,300
I'm exposing the most delicate section of the human brain.

1091
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,763
Surgery doesn't get more critical than this.

1092
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:13,570
(heart monitor beating)

1093
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:15,470
- No detectable signs of any trauma.

1094
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:16,580
It's normal.

1095
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:17,880
Color and shape are fine.

1096
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,963
Looks healthy to me.

1097
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:21,140
- Hook up the electrodes.

1098
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:23,350
I want to try applying shock stimulation.

1099
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:24,550
- Shock?

1100
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:26,170
- Use direct current platinum electrodes.

1101
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:28,010
Situate the converter between the electrodes.

1102
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:30,890
It's an exotic procedure but it works.

1103
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:33,010
- Are you sure you know what you're doing?

1104
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:34,410
Of course you do, I'm sorry.

1105
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,270
- Those experimental operations

1106
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:39,620
attempted to copy the procedure.

1107
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,460
When shock was applied to the limbic region,

1108
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,140
I saw something flash around the pituitary gland.

1109
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,850
The old monitors were low resolution

1110
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:48,440
and I couldn't get a clear and detailed close image.

1111
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,803
But I know I saw something.

1112
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,353
- [Betty] We're all set up and ready to go, Dr. Black Jack.

1113
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:00,030
- [Black Jack] We'll begin with a setting of 50 joules.

1114
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:00,930
- [Eric] Yes, sir.

1115
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,219
- Stand clear.

1116
00:50:04,219 --> 00:50:07,636
(suspenseful beat music)

1117
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:12,280
Increase the power 25 increments.

1118
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,513
- Program for a 25 joule increase.

1119
00:50:14,513 --> 00:50:16,510
(computer keys clicking)

1120
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:17,900
- Ready, doctor.

1121
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:18,733
- Clear!

1122
00:50:20,904 --> 00:50:23,790
(ominous beat music)

1123
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:24,940
Increase magnification.

1124
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:30,525
There it is.

1125
00:50:30,525 --> 00:50:33,942
(suspenseful beat music)

1126
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:58,640
Get this to the pathology lab immediately.

1127
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,473
- Yes, sir.

1128
00:51:00,555 --> 00:51:03,472
(thunder rumbling)

1129
00:51:08,154 --> 00:51:10,737
(rain pouring)

1130
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:16,713
Doctor, I have the results of the lab test on that specimen!

1131
00:51:17,814 --> 00:51:20,340
(thunder crackling)

1132
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:22,050
- [Black Jack] I think this might be it.

1133
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:23,410
- Right.

1134
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:24,860
- Doctor!

1135
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:27,891
Nicholas is conscious and his vital signs are stable!

1136
00:51:27,891 --> 00:51:30,058
(beeping)

1137
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,720
Blood pressure 100 over 60.

1138
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,930
Pulse 90.

1139
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:40,290
The operation was a success, doctor.

1140
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:42,250
- We can't call the operation a success

1141
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:45,150
until the patient is able to return to his normal lifestyle.

1142
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:46,950
- [Betty] Yes, of course.

1143
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:49,430
- So, doctor, since I'm still alive,

1144
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:51,713
can I assume the operation went okay?

1145
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,440
- We can't say for sure yet, Nicholas.

1146
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,560
However, I did remove a foreign element

1147
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,840
that was stimulating the pituitary gland.

1148
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,570
It created an over secretion of endorphins to the brain,

1149
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:04,920
burning up every organ in your body.

1150
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,480
- You've removed the generator of my superhuman abilities.

1151
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,700
I don't feel that electrical tingling sensation circulating.

1152
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,187
I've lost my power!

1153
00:52:13,187 --> 00:52:15,250
(yelling)

1154
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,083
- Doctor!

1155
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:21,170
- If I'm just going to be my old self again, I'd rather die!

1156
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:22,260
- Now pay attention!

1157
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,940
We have to know what those company doctors

1158
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,243
implanted in your brain!

1159
00:52:25,243 --> 00:52:28,027
(screaming)

1160
00:52:28,027 --> 00:52:30,777
(dramatic music)

1161
00:52:35,958 --> 00:52:38,208
(groaning)

1162
00:52:42,062 --> 00:52:44,229
(gasping)

1163
00:52:45,983 --> 00:52:49,521
(thunder rumbling)

1164
00:52:49,521 --> 00:52:52,271
(rain trickling)

1165
00:52:57,554 --> 00:53:00,137
(somber music)

1166
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,723
- 7101, you have disappointed me.

1167
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,520
Are you aware that your grade

1168
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,940
was just barely one point above failing?

1169
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,810
I will not tolerate this!

1170
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:14,910
On your next exam,

1171
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:17,622
I expect your grade to be a perfect 100 percent.

1172
00:53:17,622 --> 00:53:19,155
(thudding)

1173
00:53:19,155 --> 00:53:22,520
(electrical fizzling)

1174
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,600
- [Jo Voiceover] My path.

1175
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,233
I still have my path.

1176
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:28,210
But where's the garden?

1177
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:29,520
I can't find it.

1178
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,220
I have to find the garden.

1179
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:32,411
I must.

1180
00:53:32,411 --> 00:53:35,078
(phone ringing)

1181
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:52,876
(rain pouring)

1182
00:53:54,265 --> 00:53:56,515
(knocking)

1183
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,230
- I'm glad I didn't leave New York.

1184
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:03,620
I had a feeling you'd contact me.

1185
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:06,700
Do we have some unfinished business between us?

1186
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,940
- You know what I want.

1187
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:10,548
I've honored our contract so send Pinoko home.

1188
00:54:10,548 --> 00:54:12,965
(snickering)

1189
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,340
- Pinoko's just fine.

1190
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,620
What are you worried about, doctor?

1191
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:19,240
Don't you trust me?

1192
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,683
You have to trust me, you have no other choice.

1193
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:28,003
Sit down, try to learn how to relax.

1194
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:33,040
Why can't we let our hair down and get better acquainted?

1195
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,180
Believe me, I would never want you to be my enemy.

1196
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:37,030
That would make me very sad.

1197
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:38,770
The dream of my life would be fulfilled

1198
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:42,540
if I could just work along is the great Dr. Black Jack.

1199
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,520
I admire you very much.

1200
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,860
- I can't say the same.

1201
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,920
Not after seeing the results of your fiendish

1202
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,873
experimentations on humans.

1203
00:54:53,068 --> 00:54:55,235
(popping)

1204
00:55:00,245 --> 00:55:03,412
(electrical fizzling)

1205
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,490
I discovered this growing on

1206
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:09,010
Nicholas Doris' pituitary gland.

1207
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:10,883
It's a new breed of virus.

1208
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:12,883
- We couldn't find it.

1209
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:16,250
- I found it almost by accident,

1210
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:19,039
on the interior wall of the pituitary.

1211
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,033
- So then, it is a virus that's causing the Moira disease.

1212
00:55:22,033 --> 00:55:23,230
I knew it.

1213
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:25,270
- Now it's time for you to sit down and tell me everything

1214
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:27,690
you've been holding out on me, Jo Carol.

1215
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:29,510
Where does this virus come from?

1216
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:30,473
I think you know.

1217
00:55:31,734 --> 00:55:34,170
(somber music)

1218
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:37,000
The files mention something called Endorph-A

1219
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,270
and I'm pretty sure you can tell me what that is too.

1220
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,573
- My congratulations on your discoveries.

1221
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,390
- You can start explaining anytime now!

1222
00:55:50,563 --> 00:55:54,770
- Endorph-A is a revolutionary new drug, doctor.

1223
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:55,870
- It's a drug?

1224
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:57,500
- That's right.

1225
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,540
It's something I created myself.

1226
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:02,340
I've spent my entire adult life developing it.

1227
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:05,314
Drink you wine while the temperature's right.

1228
00:56:05,314 --> 00:56:07,897
(somber music)

1229
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,590
Endorph-A,

1230
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:14,620
it stimulates double the normal secretion

1231
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,483
of the brain hormone endorphin.

1232
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:23,690
And here we have the new, improved concentrated Endorph-A.

1233
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:26,180
This version is 10 times as powerful

1234
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:27,500
as the original formula.

1235
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:31,150
- So it was your drug that produced the super humans!

1236
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:33,020
- And our proving ground was at the Olympics.

1237
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:35,510
It was a triumph I'll never forget.

1238
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:37,880
I selected common, ordinary subjects

1239
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,420
with below average talents

1240
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:42,440
and turned them into world heroes.

1241
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,790
- Your subjects were humans,

1242
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:46,020
not just objects for you to play with.

1243
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:48,140
- [Jo] You haven't heard any of them complain, have you?

1244
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:51,130
They were extremely well compensated for their cooperation.

1245
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:53,650
We not only made them rich beyond all their dreams,

1246
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:55,800
we took a bunch of nobodies and turned them

1247
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,723
into international celebrities.

1248
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:01,430
- How many of these lucky people were there?

1249
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:03,590
- [Jo] We started with 20 volunteers.

1250
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:06,310
As the program developed, the results were so exciting

1251
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:07,610
the word began to spread.

1252
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:10,580
Volunteers showed up, demanding to be excepted.

1253
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:12,910
We wound up with 153.

1254
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:14,970
From the beginning of time, there's never been a shortage

1255
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:17,260
of people who wanted to be rich and famous.

1256
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,360
- And what about now?!

1257
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,310
Even though information is woefully inadequate,

1258
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:21,970
we know of more than 12 hundred people

1259
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:24,060
listed as \"super humans.\"

1260
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:27,490
- I swear, we treated exactly 153 of them.

1261
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:29,140
We don't know where the others came from.

1262
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,840
We don't know anything about them.

1263
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:35,640
When the side effects began showing up we panicked.

1264
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,090
Every vital organ started failing.

1265
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:39,560
The whole thing had us baffled.

1266
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,640
We couldn't find a way to combat it.

1267
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,580
- And it never occurred to you that the dream drug

1268
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:46,195
you were so proud of was actually a virus?!

1269
00:57:46,195 --> 00:57:48,596
(ominous beat music)

1270
00:57:48,596 --> 00:57:51,800
What's worse is that the disease you created is contagious!

1271
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,380
Doesn't it mean anything at all to you

1272
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:56,460
that these people are dying hideously because of you?!

1273
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:57,570
The unsuspecting ones

1274
00:57:57,570 --> 00:57:59,220
who didn't volunteer to become infected,

1275
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:02,020
have you ever given any thought to them?

1276
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,040
Well?!

1277
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,454
What do you have to say for yourself?!

1278
00:58:05,454 --> 00:58:07,970
(ominous beat music)

1279
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:09,800
The virus shouldn't be called Moira!

1280
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,813
It should be called Jo Carol Brane!

1281
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,680
- And yet it still might be made into a blessing.

1282
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,270
If we got rid of the side effects,

1283
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:19,810
Endorph-A could be the greatest thing

1284
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:21,410
that ever happened to mankind.

1285
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:23,440
Every man, woman and child on the earth

1286
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,290
would give a fortune for such a drug.

1287
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:28,480
- You're insane!

1288
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,472
(groaning)

1289
00:58:30,472 --> 00:58:33,472
(suspenseful music)

1290
00:58:40,242 --> 00:58:42,492
(thudding)

1291
00:58:44,814 --> 00:58:48,237
- You and I have both been infected.

1292
00:58:48,237 --> 00:58:50,430
The Endorph-A that was in the wine will kill us

1293
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:52,683
unless you work with me to discover the cure.

1294
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:58,340
I've always known that we were destined to work together.

1295
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:02,250
By the way, this is the new concentrated formula.

1296
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:05,312
It works fast, so we don't have a lot of time.

1297
00:59:05,312 --> 00:59:07,979
(ominous music)

1298
00:59:22,964 --> 00:59:26,714
(exciting news report music)

1299
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:30,870
- At a news conference today,

1300
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:33,577
the Medical Soldiers for Justice, MSJ,

1301
00:59:33,577 --> 00:59:35,570
detailed the charges they have leveled

1302
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:37,750
against Brane Pharmaceuticals.

1303
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:39,350
Several countries have announced

1304
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:41,150
that they'll investigate the charges

1305
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:43,190
and the World Health Organization has launched

1306
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:45,140
its own independent investigation.

1307
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:47,760
Meanwhile, the MSJ continues moving patients

1308
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,728
and their medical records out of the Brane project.

1309
00:59:50,728 --> 00:59:53,410
- I didn't know such a project existed!

1310
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:55,660
The chief executive kept her activities a secret

1311
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:58,187
from all the other company administrators!

1312
00:59:58,187 --> 00:59:59,200
(crowd yelling)

1313
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,120
- [Report] They say that your daughter

1314
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,740
is still working for your company.

1315
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:03,390
- No she's not, she's been fired!

1316
01:00:13,001 --> 01:00:14,420
- [Eric] They tell me you've already begun

1317
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,063
to suffer some of the symptoms.

1318
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:19,260
- I have a slight fever.

1319
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:22,643
- Of course, it's possible that you just have a cold, right?

1320
01:00:22,643 --> 01:00:25,310
(ominous music)

1321
01:00:28,779 --> 01:00:30,070
- Huh?

1322
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:31,210
- This is Charles Rosen.

1323
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:32,910
He was Jo Carol's number on assistant

1324
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:34,200
in new drug development.

1325
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,950
He's agreed to testify in exchange for reduced charges.

1326
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:42,080
I'm betting his testimony is gonna wipe

1327
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,280
Brane's whole company off that map.

1328
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,913
- It will.

1329
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:48,887
It all began six years ago,

1330
01:00:48,887 --> 01:00:51,090
at the Transepia Desert Rally.

1331
01:00:51,090 --> 01:00:53,080
One of the drivers strayed from the course,

1332
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,770
got lost and crashed.

1333
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:56,670
His name was Michael Jean.

1334
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:58,900
A class B driver with a bland record

1335
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:01,240
and no particular promise.

1336
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:04,140
Though his navigator was killed, Michael survived the crash

1337
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:06,270
but then he was missing for two weeks.

1338
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:08,630
How he stayed alive was beyond me.

1339
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:09,840
The whole world rejoiced

1340
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,040
when he finally was found and rescued.

1341
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,920
Everybody said it was a miracle.

1342
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,970
But the real miracle didn't become apparent

1343
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:17,723
until the next racing season.

1344
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:22,680
Michael's reputation brightened with every race he entered.

1345
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:25,650
He displayed incredibly quick judgements and reactions

1346
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:28,740
and his driving skills were a marvel to witness.

1347
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:31,990
Out of 16 Formula One wold championships,

1348
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:34,767
Michael had won 10, an unheard of record.

1349
01:01:34,767 --> 01:01:39,670
The nobody the previous season, he had become world famous.

1350
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:42,030
His unexplainable transformation

1351
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:45,000
caught the attention of Jo Carol Brane.

1352
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,790
She wined him and dined him

1353
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:50,570
and persuaded him to undergo a detailed examination.

1354
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:52,810
We discovered that while he was driving,

1355
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:54,640
Michael was secreting 10 times

1356
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,980
the normal level of endorphins.

1357
01:01:56,980 --> 01:02:00,680
During my lab workup, I also discovered something else.

1358
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,080
A grain of sand on which

1359
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,820
some kind of mold or fungus was growing.

1360
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:06,860
After intensive studies by our staff

1361
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:09,020
of world renowned bacteriologists,

1362
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:11,370
it was decided that this fungus just might be

1363
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:14,220
the interacting agent we were looking for.

1364
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:17,030
A search team equipped with state-of-the-art technology

1365
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:19,270
was dispatched to the Serbian dessert.

1366
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:20,690
They searched relentlessly.

1367
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:23,322
Inch by inch, the sand was sifted and re-sifted.

1368
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:26,620
Finally, they found the outcropping of the fungus.

1369
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:29,000
We micro-analyzed it and devised a method

1370
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,400
of refining and concentrating it.

1371
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,040
A multimillion dollar refinery was constructed

1372
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:37,190
for the soul purpose of producing Jo Carol's new product

1373
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:39,870
which she had decided to call Endorph-A.

1374
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:42,150
Naturally, the project was kept top-secret

1375
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:45,303
until we had time to test and prove the new substance.

1376
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:49,010
(sighing)

1377
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:50,810
- And do you know how many volunteers you killed

1378
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:54,020
during your campaign to test this artificial fungus?

1379
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,210
- None of us knew about the virus!

1380
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:57,380
We aren't monsters!

1381
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:59,020
All of us were convinced we were working for

1382
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:00,959
the benefit of mankind!

1383
01:03:00,959 --> 01:03:03,709
(waves sloshing)

1384
01:03:05,186 --> 01:03:07,436
(laughing)

1385
01:03:09,413 --> 01:03:10,246
- Jo, hi!

1386
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:12,683
- Hi.

1387
01:03:12,683 --> 01:03:14,087
- Jo, you finally got here!

1388
01:03:14,087 --> 01:03:15,920
What took you so long?

1389
01:03:16,902 --> 01:03:18,103
(chuckling)

1390
01:03:18,103 --> 01:03:19,030
- Did you have a nice trip?

1391
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:21,385
- Yes, it was very nice, thank you, Fendy.

1392
01:03:21,385 --> 01:03:24,322
(fireworks popping)

1393
01:03:24,322 --> 01:03:25,740
- Wow!

1394
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:26,573
Golly!

1395
01:03:39,822 --> 01:03:42,405
(somber music)

1396
01:03:45,173 --> 01:03:46,793
I wish you were here, doctor.

1397
01:03:46,793 --> 01:03:48,404
I miss you.

1398
01:03:48,404 --> 01:03:50,571
(sobbing)

1399
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:56,323
I'm having lots of fun but it's not the same without you.

1400
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:02,340
- Is she asleep?

1401
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:03,173
- Yes, ma'am.

1402
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,610
I have new orders.

1403
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:09,980
They came from the head office,

1404
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:11,970
signed by the chairman personally.

1405
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:13,524
- I understand.

1406
01:04:13,524 --> 01:04:16,274
(waves rumbling)

1407
01:04:17,752 --> 01:04:21,130
(wind howling)

1408
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:23,630
You were always very helpful to me, Fendy.

1409
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:25,500
I want you to know I appreciate it.

1410
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,020
- This isn't easy for me.

1411
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:28,890
I've been with you for 10 years.

1412
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:29,990
As for little Pinoko,

1413
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:32,270
I'm afraid that she and Dr. Black Jack are witnesses

1414
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:33,833
and won't survive your mistake.

1415
01:04:35,376 --> 01:04:38,950
(gunshot booming)

1416
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:40,300
I'm sorry, Jo, but our friendship

1417
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:41,953
isn't as important as my job.

1418
01:04:43,983 --> 01:04:45,056
(gasping)

1419
01:04:45,056 --> 01:04:47,306
(groaning)

1420
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:52,859
(gunshot booming)

1421
01:04:52,859 --> 01:04:55,900
(Fendy groaning)

1422
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,103
- Sorry, Fendy, I still have work to do.

1423
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,750
It's nothing personal, Fendy.

1424
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:04,750
It's strictly business, pure and simple.

1425
01:05:06,077 --> 01:05:08,827
(dramatic music)

1426
01:05:11,127 --> 01:05:14,013
(boat horn blowing)

1427
01:05:14,013 --> 01:05:15,660
- [Pinoko] I wish Fendy could've come with us.

1428
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:16,493
- [Jo] Me too.

1429
01:05:16,493 --> 01:05:18,180
She said to tell you she was sorry.

1430
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,400
- What else did she say?

1431
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,240
- Well, she said I shouldn't let you overeat

1432
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:22,506
or watch too much television.

1433
01:05:22,506 --> 01:05:23,339
(giggling)

1434
01:05:23,339 --> 01:05:24,960
- [Pinoko] That's Fendy all right.

1435
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,590
- When my mother was a little girl,

1436
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:28,040
they didn't have television.

1437
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,210
- Oh.

1438
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:30,514
How awful.

1439
01:05:30,514 --> 01:05:34,014
(phone dial tone buzzing)

1440
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:36,980
- [Operator] We're sorry, the number you have dialed

1441
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:38,250
is no longer in service.

1442
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:40,310
It was disconnected at the customer's request

1443
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:42,010
and no new number has been listed.

1444
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:44,683
- Thanks, Jo!

1445
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,580
- [Man] Sorry, sir, they left no forwarding address

1446
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:49,420
when they checked out.

1447
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:50,310
- Thanks.

1448
01:05:50,310 --> 01:05:51,653
The fever's getting worse.

1449
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:53,920
- I'm sorry they just vanished

1450
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,190
off the face of the earth, doctor.

1451
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:57,376
Nobody had any idea where to look for them.

1452
01:05:57,376 --> 01:06:00,209
(train whooshing)

1453
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:09,557
- [Jack Voiceover] My temperature's been about 102

1454
01:06:09,557 --> 01:06:11,003
for the last three hours.

1455
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,060
- [Eric] Are you sure you wanna go to the airport?

1456
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:14,893
- Yes.

1457
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:19,460
- [Jack Voiceover] I'm having to struggle to stay conscious.

1458
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:21,263
I can't afford to become delirious.

1459
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:26,040
I wonder what condition Jo Carol's in?

1460
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,900
She drank a lot more of that Endorph-A than I did.

1461
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,875
Is she able to care for Pinoko?

1462
01:06:30,875 --> 01:06:33,840
(waves rumbling)

1463
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:36,660
- Get ready, world, here comes Pinoko!

1464
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:39,420
Golly, I never felt so beautiful in my whole life.

1465
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:40,380
I love it!

1466
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:41,440
- I'm glad.

1467
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,872
You are a beautiful girl.

1468
01:06:42,872 --> 01:06:44,690
- You're beautiful too, Jo.

1469
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:46,250
Like a supermodel.

1470
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:47,740
- Thank you very much.

1471
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:48,573
- Beautiful lady,

1472
01:06:48,573 --> 01:06:50,969
may I have the honor of escorting you to dinner?

1473
01:06:50,969 --> 01:06:53,969
(upbeat jazz music)

1474
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:01,760
Do you hear the band?

1475
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,382
- [Jo] Be careful now!

1476
01:07:03,382 --> 01:07:04,215
- Hurry!

1477
01:07:04,215 --> 01:07:06,465
(groaning)

1478
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:08,588
Jo?

1479
01:07:08,588 --> 01:07:10,046
(gasping)

1480
01:07:10,046 --> 01:07:10,879
What is it?

1481
01:07:10,879 --> 01:07:11,949
What's wrong?

1482
01:07:11,949 --> 01:07:12,866
Talk to me.

1483
01:07:14,529 --> 01:07:17,632
(whooshing)

1484
01:07:17,632 --> 01:07:20,460
- [Announcer] Flight 1533 will board in 10 minutes

1485
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:21,668
at gate B7.

1486
01:07:21,668 --> 01:07:25,346
- Our flight will get you there three hours quicker.

1487
01:07:25,346 --> 01:07:28,346
(airport commotion)

1488
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,910
- Doctor?

1489
01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:38,950
We found the files you wanted from the research center.

1490
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:40,430
I can't believe how lucky we were.

1491
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:43,700
It had fallen on the floor behind the shredding machine.

1492
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,080
- [Black Jack] I knew they'd have tracking reports

1493
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:45,913
on the victims.

1494
01:07:45,913 --> 01:07:49,100
(paper flipping)

1495
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:51,763
Here's the final summary report on Lisa Siegel.

1496
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:55,300
- [Man Voiceover] Since 1990, Lisa had been treated

1497
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:58,790
at Parker Hospital for Paroxysmal Hemolytic Anemia.

1498
01:07:58,790 --> 01:08:02,180
In 1992, transfusion therapy was begun.

1499
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:05,478
In 1994, experimental Endorph-A blood was added

1500
01:08:05,478 --> 01:08:07,900
by administrative order.

1501
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,400
- [Jack Voiceover] Administrative order!

1502
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,237
A business decision!

1503
01:08:11,237 --> 01:08:13,540
(plane whooshing)

1504
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:14,860
- [Man Voiceover] In 1996,

1505
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:17,360
she suffered Organ Insufficiency Syndrome,

1506
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:20,770
all indication suggested probable blood stream infection.

1507
01:08:20,770 --> 01:08:23,408
In 1998, the patient expired.

1508
01:08:23,408 --> 01:08:26,040
(thunder rumbling)

1509
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,110
Attending physicians were Michael Salon,

1510
01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:31,100
John Richardson, Judy Austin, Ralph Geiss

1511
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:33,640
and on unofficial and confidential consultation,

1512
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:36,030
and uncertified doctor, Kurō Hazama,

1513
01:08:36,030 --> 01:08:37,890
known as Black Jack.

1514
01:08:37,890 --> 01:08:40,070
For further information concerning the consultant,

1515
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:43,331
Dr. Black Jack, refer to chief Dr. Jo Carol.

1516
01:08:43,331 --> 01:08:46,248
(thunder rumbling)

1517
01:08:50,062 --> 01:08:52,645
(wind howling)

1518
01:08:53,918 --> 01:08:56,751
(engine rumbling)

1519
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,230
- My father was a Sybian.

1520
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:02,040
This is like my second home.

1521
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:03,230
This is Tonja,

1522
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:05,133
the last outpost of civilization.

1523
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:09,250
Beyond here, it's population zero.

1524
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:11,580
The only humans you might see are nomadic desert people

1525
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:13,473
who live constantly on the move.

1526
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:20,423
See why that fungus was never discovered before?

1527
01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:23,980
Nobody in their right mind would come out here,

1528
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:25,353
except the Desert Gods.

1529
01:09:25,353 --> 01:09:28,170
(somber beat music)

1530
01:09:28,170 --> 01:09:30,040
- [Black Jack] Who are the Desert Gods?

1531
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,690
- That's what the villagers call the nomads.

1532
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:35,360
Ordinary humans couldn't survive in such a place.

1533
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,603
The nomads are a mysterious breed of people.

1534
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,890
You'll never see them unless they want you to.

1535
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:43,430
I have a feeling they're watching us

1536
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:44,630
every minute we're here.

1537
01:09:45,519 --> 01:09:48,602
(ominous beat music)

1538
01:09:57,166 --> 01:09:59,749
(wind howling)

1539
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:09,570
Brane's done a great job of disguising the place

1540
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:10,640
as an oil refinery.

1541
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,050
Pretty clever.

1542
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:13,810
No one would ever suspect that what's actually

1543
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:16,833
being refined here is a top secret pharmaceutical drug.

1544
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:21,210
If you don't want anyone to know what you're up to,

1545
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:23,875
there's no better place than here to do it.

1546
01:10:23,875 --> 01:10:27,340
(water whooshing)

1547
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:29,293
Sounds like it's coming from the second level.

1548
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:37,617
- Thank God.

1549
01:10:37,617 --> 01:10:39,035
- Huh?

1550
01:10:39,035 --> 01:10:40,605
- Pinoko!

1551
01:10:40,605 --> 01:10:41,550
- Is it?

1552
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:43,466
Yes! Yes! It is!

1553
01:10:43,466 --> 01:10:44,756
It's...

1554
01:10:44,756 --> 01:10:45,867
It's our doctor!

1555
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:46,700
- [Black Jack] Hey, it's all right.

1556
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:47,632
- I thought I'd never see you again.

1557
01:10:47,632 --> 01:10:48,986
- [Black Jack] Everything's all right.

1558
01:10:48,986 --> 01:10:51,348
Don't cry, Pinoko, you're safe now.

1559
01:10:51,348 --> 01:10:52,230
There now.

1560
01:10:52,230 --> 01:10:53,563
There, there, it's okay.

1561
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:56,420
What about Jo Carol?

1562
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:58,580
Where is she, Pinoko?

1563
01:10:58,580 --> 01:10:59,830
- Jo's really sick, doctor.

1564
01:10:59,830 --> 01:11:01,591
She's got something awful.

1565
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:03,758
(gasping)

1566
01:11:13,243 --> 01:11:14,124
Huh?

1567
01:11:14,124 --> 01:11:15,197
Stop that!

1568
01:11:15,197 --> 01:11:16,704
You shouldn't be trying to work.

1569
01:11:16,704 --> 01:11:19,454
Go back to bed, you need to rest.

1570
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:22,340
- I don't have time to rest.

1571
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:25,010
I have to find the answer before I die.

1572
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:26,470
Can't give up.

1573
01:11:26,470 --> 01:11:28,183
Got to find the strength to go on.

1574
01:11:29,066 --> 01:11:31,316
(groaning)

1575
01:11:32,183 --> 01:11:33,310
(gasping)

1576
01:11:33,310 --> 01:11:35,610
- Still proud of this hideous monster of yours?

1577
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:37,273
How does your own medicine taste?

1578
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:40,610
- Have you reconsidered my offer to work together?

1579
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:44,100
(laughing)

1580
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:47,650
We'll find the cure for Moira

1581
01:11:47,650 --> 01:11:49,730
and we'll bask in the gratitude and worship

1582
01:11:49,730 --> 01:11:52,720
of millions all over the world!

1583
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,450
But that will be nothing compared to the day

1584
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:56,520
when mankind achieves its full potential

1585
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,089
through the miracle of Endorph-A!

1586
01:11:59,089 --> 01:12:00,992
(gagging)

1587
01:12:00,992 --> 01:12:03,073
(blood squelching)

1588
01:12:03,073 --> 01:12:05,321
(coughing)

1589
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:08,330
(whimpering)

1590
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:09,860
- Stay there, both of you!

1591
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,330
If you come in contact with her blood,

1592
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:13,640
you could be infected too.

1593
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:14,473
- What?

1594
01:12:14,473 --> 01:12:16,420
- Take Pinoko and get yourselves to a safe area.

1595
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:18,810
Stay there until you hear further word from me.

1596
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:19,910
- But doctor,

1597
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:22,040
you're running a risk of being infected yourself.

1598
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,520
Nobody's immune.

1599
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,370
- I'm aware of that, Betty, but I've already been infected.

1600
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:27,977
- But...

1601
01:12:27,977 --> 01:12:29,150
(gasping)

1602
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:29,983
- Get out of here!

1603
01:12:29,983 --> 01:12:31,300
We have enough victims!

1604
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:33,785
It won't serve any purpose for you to die too!

1605
01:12:33,785 --> 01:12:36,368
(wind howling)

1606
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:45,120
- [Jack Voiceover] Are they expecting me

1607
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,943
to perform some sort of miracle?

1608
01:12:54,982 --> 01:12:57,565
(somber music)

1609
01:12:59,516 --> 01:13:01,766
(groaning)

1610
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:04,720
- My compliments to you on your thoroughness.

1611
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,520
This laboratory is stocked and equipped

1612
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:09,197
with everything that we could possible require.

1613
01:13:09,197 --> 01:13:10,987
- I knew you would stay here and help me.

1614
01:13:10,987 --> 01:13:13,360
I'd never do it for you but I knew you would.

1615
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,610
(groaning)

1616
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:19,570
- I want to know who issued the executive order

1617
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:22,210
to give Lisa Siegel the experimental transfusion

1618
01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:23,550
of Enorph-A.

1619
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:26,860
- I did and I'm sure you already figured that out by now.

1620
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:29,530
- But I will never understand why you did it.

1621
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:30,720
Her records clearly show

1622
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,890
that she didn't volunteer for your program.

1623
01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:33,940
She wasn't even aware

1624
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:36,080
that you were experimenting with her life!

1625
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:38,580
- I know, I hate myself.

1626
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:39,980
- [Black Jack] Why did you do it?

1627
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:42,060
- What if my reasons aren't acceptable?

1628
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:43,700
Will you demand revenge for Lisa Siegel

1629
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:47,470
and will you allow me to suffer unbearable pain for my sins?

1630
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:49,553
- Like Lisa had to suffer?

1631
01:13:49,553 --> 01:13:50,958
(ominous music)

1632
01:13:50,958 --> 01:13:53,244
(laughing)

1633
01:13:53,244 --> 01:13:55,977
(helicopters buzzing)

1634
01:13:55,977 --> 01:13:58,227
(coughing)

1635
01:14:06,781 --> 01:14:07,883
- By the time we treated Lisa,

1636
01:14:07,883 --> 01:14:10,810
I had absolute confidence in Endorph-A.

1637
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:13,380
None of the side effects had begun to show up yet.

1638
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:15,900
We were seeing nothing but wonderful results

1639
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:17,840
with one ordinary person after another

1640
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,330
developing incredible abilities.

1641
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:21,890
And it was my word that decided

1642
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:24,610
who would get to become a super human.

1643
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:27,760
I began to feel that I acquired god-like powers.

1644
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,210
My discovery was gonna produce

1645
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:32,490
a miraculous new future for all mankind.

1646
01:14:32,490 --> 01:14:35,560
It was then that Lisa Siegel came to us.

1647
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:37,670
Her doctor had referred her to Brane Hospital

1648
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:41,360
for observation and advanced specialized therapy.

1649
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,980
She was adorable.

1650
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:45,600
Everyone fell in love with her at first sight.

1651
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,230
She reminded me of myself when I was her age.

1652
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:49,200
So much so that I began to think,

1653
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,257
\"This could be your daughter.\"

1654
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:53,970
And because I fell in love with her,

1655
01:14:53,970 --> 01:14:55,700
I decided to play god with her life

1656
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,733
and to give her a wonderful new future.

1657
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:01,280
- What you did was totally immoral!

1658
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:03,840
You practiced experimental medicine on a child!

1659
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:04,840
If you really loved her,

1660
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:07,333
how could you have take such a risk with her life?

1661
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:12,320
Are you totally devoid of human compassion?!

1662
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:16,223
- Well, I feel compassion for you and me at this moment.

1663
01:15:16,223 --> 01:15:17,056
(groaning)

1664
01:15:17,056 --> 01:15:20,267
- What happened that transformed you into such a monster?!

1665
01:15:21,252 --> 01:15:23,419
(gagging)

1666
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:29,980
- What should we do, doctor?

1667
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:30,813
- Doctor?

1668
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:33,310
- Get prepared for surgery.

1669
01:15:33,310 --> 01:15:34,150
- [Eric And Betty] Yes, sir.

1670
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:35,556
- [Pinoko] Yes, doctor.

1671
01:15:35,556 --> 01:15:38,639
(helicopter buzzing)

1672
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:49,160
- [Jack Voiceover] I could feel the affect of Endorph-A

1673
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,823
on my powers of concentration.

1674
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:55,100
Realizing that I would be utilizing super human skills

1675
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:57,030
in my performance of this surgery,

1676
01:15:57,030 --> 01:16:00,483
I made the incision with absolute certainty and security.

1677
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:06,330
I had never felt such excitement.

1678
01:16:06,330 --> 01:16:08,230
My vision was incredible.

1679
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:11,590
I could actually see the nerve tissues within the organs.

1680
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:14,520
I could ever see the cells within the blood capillaries.

1681
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,410
I knew I would have to work fast, though,

1682
01:16:16,410 --> 01:16:19,683
as the fever was rapidly overcome my body's defense systems.

1683
01:16:23,019 --> 01:16:26,263
(ominous music)

1684
01:16:26,263 --> 01:16:27,660
(yelling)

1685
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:28,682
- I'm burning up!

1686
01:16:28,682 --> 01:16:31,466
(gasping)

1687
01:16:31,466 --> 01:16:33,253
I feel as if I'm on fire!

1688
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:38,263
(wind howling)

1689
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:41,850
- Cardio pulmonary functions and EEG waves

1690
01:16:41,850 --> 01:16:44,280
are returning to normal, doctor.

1691
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,240
- Doctor, you did it!

1692
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:48,460
And look, I can't believe it but you managed

1693
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:50,908
to complete the operation in 27 minutes.

1694
01:16:50,908 --> 01:16:53,410
(groaning)

1695
01:16:53,410 --> 01:16:54,510
Dr. Black Jack!

1696
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:55,343
- [Pinoko] What do you need?

1697
01:16:55,343 --> 01:16:57,260
What can we do to help?

1698
01:17:01,074 --> 01:17:03,386

01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:13,753
It's up there.

1739
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:16,123
Just beyond that sand dune.

1740
01:19:17,530 --> 01:19:20,197
(ominous music)

1741
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,023
You can put me down.

1742
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:30,717
Here it is, the birthplace of Endorph-A.

1743
01:19:32,230 --> 01:19:34,940
These glowing particles were refined and concentrated

1744
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:38,430
into the drug that stimulated the evolution of super humans.

1745
01:19:38,430 --> 01:19:40,160
One of our scientists theorize

1746
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,750
that some kind of a mold in the sand

1747
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:44,470
had mutated into an all new living entity.

1748
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:45,860
Maybe it didn't originate here.

1749
01:19:45,860 --> 01:19:48,270
Maybe it came from some place else.

1750
01:19:48,270 --> 01:19:50,040
I believe that during a blooming season,

1751
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,480
the wind might have picked up the fungus

1752
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:53,600
from the mountains deep in the desert and brought it here,

1753
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,630
to a favorable environment.

1754
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:58,350
I've never been able to find the source, though.

1755
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:02,050
- You think this is actually some kind of spore?

1756
01:20:02,050 --> 01:20:04,240
- I haven't been able to find it yet

1757
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,833
but somewhere out there I a garden of paradise.

1758
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:11,340
My garden is a glorious, beautiful place

1759
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:12,993
where all life began.

1760
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,417
You and I can live in the garden forever!

1761
01:20:16,417 --> 01:20:18,320
(gunshots booming)

1762
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,570
(groaning)

1763
01:20:22,088 --> 01:20:25,171
(helicopter buzzing)

1764
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:30,740
- Mission accomplished, returning home.

1765
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:39,070
- I gambled and I lost.

1766
01:20:39,070 --> 01:20:41,540
Please believe me, I'm not evil.

1767
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:44,490
I really thought mankind would benefit from Endorph-A.

1768
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:45,760
I was a victim,

1769
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,730
a helpless victim who had to live my life

1770
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:50,770
at the mercy of a heartless father who never loved me.

1771
01:20:50,770 --> 01:20:53,460
A truly evil man who developed medical technology

1772
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:54,920
purely for commercial purposes

1773
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:56,483
to make himself a millionaire.

1774
01:20:57,740 --> 01:20:59,510
- I know the type.

1775
01:20:59,510 --> 01:21:00,700
- I know

1776
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:03,670
and you've fought them all your life, haven't you?

1777
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:06,740
(somber music)

1778
01:21:06,740 --> 01:21:09,950
- Everyone must take responsibility for their own actions.

1779
01:21:09,950 --> 01:21:12,070
Why do you blame your father?

1780
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:14,120
- Because he created me.

1781
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:17,000
I was conceived in a laboratory test tube.

1782
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,450
I was just another product of Brane Pharmaceuticals.

1783
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:22,530
My real name is 7101.

1784
01:21:22,530 --> 01:21:25,170
I was one of 30 test tube babies.

1785
01:21:25,170 --> 01:21:26,950
We were raised at Brane Institute

1786
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:29,640
with our diet and health constantly monitored.

1787
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:33,290
We had the best of everything, except loving parents.

1788
01:21:33,290 --> 01:21:36,020
Chairman Brane planned to adopt one of us as his heir,

1789
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:38,810
chosen by a process of elimination.

1790
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:42,280
We received advanced education of the highest standards.

1791
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:45,290
The competition to excel became more cutthroat every year

1792
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:48,180
as one by one our number grew smaller.

1793
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:50,890
The pressure to succeed was savage.

1794
01:21:50,890 --> 01:21:53,750
We dreaded failure more than death itself.

1795
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:56,730
We never heard what happened to those who were eliminated.

1796
01:21:56,730 --> 01:21:59,103
But we knew it must be a horrible fate.

1797
01:22:00,410 --> 01:22:03,820
The only way to survive was to defeat my classmates,

1798
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:05,350
my friends.

1799
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:07,270
Under this stress and tension,

1800
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:09,710
I became more and more self-absorbed,

1801
01:22:09,710 --> 01:22:11,523
more ruthless and unfeeling.

1802
01:22:12,417 --> 01:22:15,780
I felt as though my soul had become imprisoned

1803
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:20,030
in a solid block of ice and cast adrift in limbo.

1804
01:22:20,030 --> 01:22:21,470
As the final survivor,

1805
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:24,530
I became Chairman Brane's adopted daughter.

1806
01:22:24,530 --> 01:22:26,940
I was greedy, cunning, cold-hearted

1807
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:31,050
and consumed by blind ambition worthy of the family name

1808
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:34,210
and now I'll die the same way I lived.

1809
01:22:34,210 --> 01:22:35,584
All alone.

1810
01:22:35,584 --> 01:22:38,780
(dramatic music)

1811
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:40,410
Forgive me.

1812
01:22:40,410 --> 01:22:41,753
I never had a chance.

1813
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:51,589
(wind howling)

1814
01:23:02,076 --> 01:23:05,243
(dramatic beat music)

1815
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:12,401
(groaning)

1816
01:23:18,211 --> 01:23:20,378
(gagging)

1817
01:23:23,388 --> 01:23:25,638
(coughing)

1818
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:31,980
- [Jack Voiceover] Intestinal bleeding.

1819
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:34,570
About 50 CCs a minute.

1820
01:23:34,570 --> 01:23:36,770
No doubt the final stages of Moira Syndrome.

1821
01:23:38,609 --> 01:23:40,776
(gagging)

1822
01:23:43,577 --> 01:23:45,100
Losing my vision.

1823
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:47,563
Incardio dysrhythmia seems to be setting in.

1824
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:52,083
Pulse is becoming extremely weak.

1825
01:23:52,083 --> 01:23:54,690
(ominous music)

1826
01:23:54,690 --> 01:23:56,583
Death must be very near at hand.

1827
01:24:01,973 --> 01:24:04,030
All that's been keeping me alive

1828
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:06,863
is my permeative survival instinct.

1829
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:11,540
But now, I'm beginning to feel that even the will to survive

1830
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:13,723
is fading away.

1831
01:24:15,862 --> 01:24:18,445
(wind howling)

1832
01:24:34,842 --> 01:24:37,009
(gagging)

1833
01:24:42,045 --> 01:24:44,712
(ominous music)

1834
01:24:51,854 --> 01:24:53,590
- Is this some sort of medicine?

1835
01:24:53,590 --> 01:24:55,340
- Yes, it is Fulgium.

1836
01:25:03,654 --> 01:25:05,071
Fulgium in bloom.

1837
01:25:06,610 --> 01:25:08,035
- It's Jo's garden!

1838
01:25:08,035 --> 01:25:10,952
(eerie beat music)

1839
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:26,101
(city commotion)

1840
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:31,240
- This is Fulgium, a flowering plant that grows

1841
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,520
only in the heart of the Serbian desert.

1842
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,830
A poisonous virus attaches itself to the pollen

1843
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:39,230
of the Fulgium but the plant itself is harmless.

1844
01:25:39,230 --> 01:25:41,010
Fulgium produces a natural antibody

1845
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:43,970
which permits it to survive and co-exist with the virus,

1846
01:25:43,970 --> 01:25:46,123
which is the source of the Moira Syndrome.

1847
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,340
I'm happy to report that we've been able

1848
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:51,960
to develop and extract from the stalk of the Fulgium,

1849
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:54,510
which has proved to be an affective remedy and preventative

1850
01:25:54,510 --> 01:25:56,583
in the treatment of the Moira disease.

1851
01:25:58,710 --> 01:26:01,100
Sybian natives have known about the poisonous pollen

1852
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:03,150
and it's cure for thousands of years.

1853
01:26:03,150 --> 01:26:04,720
The tribe could've amassed a fortune

1854
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:07,640
by treating the extract as a commercial trade commodity.

1855
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:09,590
But, instead, they have shard the secret

1856
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:12,300
freely with the world.

1857
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:13,350
That's the good news.

1858
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:15,180
Now the bad news.

1859
01:26:15,180 --> 01:26:16,870
There's a mutation of the virus,

1860
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:19,610
immune to the extract and every other remedy as well.

1861
01:26:19,610 --> 01:26:21,410
So far, we've been able to keep it contained

1862
01:26:21,410 --> 01:26:22,863
but our time is running out.

1863
01:26:24,710 --> 01:26:26,220
The natives tell us their mother desert

1864
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:27,853
has grown ill and weak.

1865
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:31,060
They don't know what we've done to our world.

1866
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:33,070
They make no connection between their sick desert

1867
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:35,093
and our acid rain and pollution.

1868
01:26:37,330 --> 01:26:39,840
Well, we know what the problems are!

1869
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,930
When are we going to do something about it?!

1870
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:43,350
Wake up, mankind!

1871
01:26:43,350 --> 01:26:45,203
The doomsday clock is ticking!

1872
01:26:47,193 --> 01:26:49,943
(city commotion)

1873
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:57,890
There, on the sidewalk.

1874
01:26:57,890 --> 01:26:58,723
- Huh?

1875
01:26:58,723 --> 01:26:59,630
- Isn't that?

1876
01:26:59,630 --> 01:27:00,580
I'll be right back.

1877
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:02,533
Doctor!

1878
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:04,593
Wait just a minute!

1879
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:07,210
Dr. Black Jack, wait!

1880
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:08,323
It's me, Eric!

1881
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:13,950
Have you thought about what I asked you

1882
01:27:13,950 --> 01:27:15,610
the last time I saw you, doctor?

1883
01:27:15,610 --> 01:27:16,890
Or did you forget about it?

1884
01:27:16,890 --> 01:27:19,560
- I guess you'll have to refresh my memory.

1885
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:21,130
- I was hoping you might consider joining

1886
01:27:21,130 --> 01:27:22,730
our unit of the MSJ,

1887
01:27:22,730 --> 01:27:24,760
perhaps even as a consultant.

1888
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:26,230
- I don't recall anything about that, do you?

1889
01:27:26,230 --> 01:27:28,410
- Uh-uh, not a thing.

1890
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:30,360
- Well, that's okay, think about it now.

1891
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:31,670
- Sorry, I have a patient waiting.

1892
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:32,770
Maybe some other time.

1893
01:27:33,978 --> 01:27:34,811
- Doctor!

1894
01:27:34,811 --> 01:27:36,933
- Doctor Black Jack, won't you help us out?

1895
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:39,410
- Of course I will.

1896
01:27:39,410 --> 01:27:40,811
We all have the same goal,

1897
01:27:40,811 --> 01:27:43,780
just different ways in contributing our abilities.

1898
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:45,780
- [Eric] You just won't join any group, will you?

1899
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:47,000
- No.

1900
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,693
- Goodbye, hope we meet again sometime!

1901
01:27:52,890 --> 01:27:53,890
Doctor, wait for me!

1902
01:27:55,842 --> 01:27:58,592
