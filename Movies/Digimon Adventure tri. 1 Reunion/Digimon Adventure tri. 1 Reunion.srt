Over here, Joe.

1014
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:58,428
JOE: Hi. Sorry I'm late.

1015
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:01,264
MIMI: Joe, long time no see!

1016
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:03,200
Look, I brought you a present.

1017
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:05,702
Oh, boy. It's good to see you.

1018
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:07,304
Yeah. You, too, Mimi.

1019
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,405
You haven't changed at all.

1020
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:09,473
Thanks for coming by.

1021
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,808
I know you're busy and that you should be studying.

1022
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,111
No. It's all right.

1023
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:16,246
There's definitely a lot we need to talk about.

1024
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:17,681
Mm-hmm.

1025
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:20,417
IZZY: So, let's review the situation.

1026
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:22,619
I've gathered data on what I see is the six major

1027
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:24,621
recent phenomena.

1028
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:25,789
Okay.

1029
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:27,824
Phenomenon number one, as we all know,

1030
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,360
is that the gate to the Digiworld has been closed off

1031
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:31,795
for the last year or so.

1032
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:33,563
I figured that was because our Digivices

1033
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:35,665
have been malfunctioning for some reason.

1034
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,634
IZZY: That's phenomenon number two.

1035
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:40,237
Number three, these areas around the waterfront

1036
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,272
shopping district have been experiencing

1037
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:43,640
frequency interferences,

1038
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:46,843
with mysterious blackouts occurring right afterward.

1039
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,546
Number four, these frequency interferences

1040
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:52,416
are affecting networks that aren't locally connected,

1041
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:55,652
resulting in poor reception for cell phones, radios,

1042
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:58,255
and television broadcasts.

1043
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:00,390
Number five, a distortion in space

1044
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:03,226
caused by unknown forces has created a new link

1045
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,628
between us and the Digiworld.

1046
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:07,230
That's how these Digimon are coming into our world.

1047
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:10,467
SORA: Like yesterday's Kuwagamon.

1048
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,470
IZZY: Number six, the Digimon coming through this distortion

1049
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:15,505
are different from any we've seen before.

1050
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:18,642
They've been mutated somehow by causes unknown.

1051
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:20,610
Anyway, I think it's safe to assume

1052
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:22,212
that all these phenomena

1053
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,247
are a result of this distortion.

1054
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:25,916
Distortion?

1055
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:27,417
They're all interconnected.

1056
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:30,353
I didn't see it at first, but now I'm sure of it.

1057
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:33,190
Each phenomenon is a result of the others.

1058
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:35,192
For example, the frequency interferences

1059
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:36,827
are clearly caused by the distortion

1060
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,463
as was proven by what happened yesterday,

1061
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:41,331
and the distortion caused the link

1062
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:43,300
between the Digiworld and ours.

1063
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:45,235
It looks to me like the Digiworld is forcibly

1064
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:46,937
intruding itself into our network.

1065
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:49,573
Hey, Tai. Did you talk to Mr. Nishijima?

1066
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:50,707
TAI: No.

1067
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,642
He didn't come to school today.

1068
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:55,679
You guys, did you watch the news?

1069
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:58,215
Did you hear the terrible things they were saying?

1070
00:51:58,248 --> 00:51:59,382
Yeah. I heard it.

1071
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:00,851
It was awful.

1072
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:02,886
Like all Digimon are the same.

1073
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:06,590
MATT: Jerks. I'm gonna have my dad file an official complaint.

1074
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,358
You know it's just all the media outlets

1075
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:11,695
trying to boost their ratings by sensationalizing everything.

1076
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:14,531
TAI: Still, some of what they said was true.

1077
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:15,499
-Huh? -Huh?

1078
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:18,435
Well, I mean, after all, a lot of the city

1079
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:21,471
and the airport were destroyed when Kuwagamon appeared.

1080
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:22,472
ALL: Hmm.

1081
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:24,708
IZZY: Things are definitely out of control.

1082
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:26,309
T. K.: It's no wonder people are a little upset.

1083
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:27,711
MIMI: Yeah. But it would have been worse

1084
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:29,412
if our Digimon hadn't fought them,

1085
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:30,547
a whole lot worse.

1086
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,549
MATT: That's right but nobody knows that.

1087
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:33,984
Our Digimon aren't the problem,

1088
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:36,286
but these news people keep saying they are.

1089
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,554
They're pissing me off.

1090
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:39,656
TAI: [ Sighing ]

1091
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:42,359
That's all you got? Come on.

1092
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:44,294
Whose side are you on?

1093
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:47,430
We can't just sit back and do nothing.

1094
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:48,565
You heard what Izzy said.

1095
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:49,900
There's a bunch of really bad things

1096
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:52,469
starting to happen all around us.

1097
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,905
We're the only ones who can do something about it.

1098
00:52:54,938 --> 00:52:57,874
-TAI: Well, yeah, but... -Yeah, but what?

1099
00:52:57,908 --> 00:52:59,843
Have you forgotten everything we've done?

1100
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:01,077
How hard we all fought together

1101
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:03,947
to save the Digital World and our world, too?

1102
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,383
Of course I haven't forgotten.

1103
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:08,618
MATT: So what do we do now, then? Nothing?

1104
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,722
Okay, then.

1105
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:14,958
[ Sighing ]

1106
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:16,359
Well, Tai?

1107
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:18,595
Calm down. That's enough, Matt.

1108
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:21,965
Yeah. You're right.

1109
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:23,833
Okay. Skip it, Tai.

1110
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,436
If that's how you're gonna be,

1111
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:29,539
then, I don't know why we had this meeting in the first place.

1112
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:30,874
IZZY: There has to be a connection...

1113
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:33,443
TAI: Come on, Matt.

1114
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:36,379
IZZY: And I'll bet it's right under my nose.

1115
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:37,847
MATT: [ Sighing ]

1116
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,482
-What happened? -We need to figure this out.

1117
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:40,750
-Whatever. -There has to be an answer...

1118
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:42,519
-I'm out of here, too. -...and I'll bet

1119
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,955
it's right here at my fingertips.

1120
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:46,656
Don't worry, Sora.

1121
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:47,991
I'll smooth things over with my brother

1122
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:49,326
when I talk to him.

1123
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,461
And I'll talk to Tai.

1124
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:53,463
Well, I guess this meeting is adjourned, then.

1125
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:55,665
Just as well. I'm starving, actually.

1126
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:57,701
Does anybody wanna go grab a bite to eat?

1127
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,035
JOE: Not me. I gotta study.

1128
00:53:59,069 --> 00:53:59,402
Huh?

1129
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:02,606
You know, maybe you could use a break.

1130
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:04,374
I just don't have the time.

1131
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:06,676
I can't even make time for my girlfriend.

1132
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:07,844
ALL: Girlfriend?

1133
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:08,979
Wait a minute.

1134
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:10,780
You have a girlfriend, Joe?

1135
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:12,482
MIMI: I don't believe it. Since when?

1136
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:14,651
A girlfriend? For real?

1137
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:16,753
MIMI: Oh, poor guy. We shouldn't act so shocked.

1138
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:17,887
JOE: What's so weird about that?

1139
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:18,888
I'm nearly out of high school.

1140
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,724
Why shouldn't I have a girlfriend?

1141
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,826
Don't I have a right to find happiness?

1142
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:24,728
Why doesn't anyone believe me?

1143
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,464
We'd better say we believe him, guys.

1144
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:28,865
ALL: We believe you.

1145
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:32,802
JOE: No, you don't. You're just saying that.

1146
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:37,474
Mimi, over here.

1147
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:39,542
-MIMI: Palmon? -Look. Biyomon and Gatomon

1148
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,311
are here, too.

Oh, boy, it's so yummy.

1160

This is the kind of food I missed the most

while I was away, it's the best.

I agree.

I wish there was someone who could cook like this

01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:44,193
TAI: Not bad at all.

1337
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:45,561
I'll get that.

1338
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:48,564
Yes. Who is it?

1339

What is this place, anyway?

1342
01:02:56,339 --> 01:02:58,541
It's Izzy's office. Can you believe it?

1343
01:02:58,574 --> 01:03:01,144
No way. Seriously?

1344
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:03,079
Yeah. We've never seen it before, either.

1345
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:06,048
Yeah. I'm helping out a friend who's starting a new company.

1346
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:07,250
I'm impressed.

1347
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,085
Really, Izzy?

1348
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:11,187
TAI: Anyway, that's about everything

1349

IZZY: Infected Digimon, huh?

01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:18,194
And these things could come back at any time?

1352
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:19,428
That's pretty annoying.

1353
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,297
I'm sure glad you and the other Digimon

1354
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:23,065
have come to help us, Biyomon.

1355
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:25,401
Izzy, don't you think it's time to show everyone

1356
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:27,170
what you've come up with?

1357
01:03:27,203 --> 01:03:29,872
Yeah. You're right. Let's do it.

1358
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:32,074
TENTOMON: Okay. You two, come with me.

They're right there.

1364
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:48,958
Izzy: Check it out. I thought our Digimon

1365
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,560
should have a place they can escape to

1366

in an emergency,

1367
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:54,664
so I created a secure virtual cyberspace

1368
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:56,332
on my server here.

How do I work this thing again?

1372
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:08,244
There, look. You got a text, too, from Agumon.

1373
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:10,012
You can communicate by texting

1374
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:12,381
or by talking directly through the monitors.

1375
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:15,251
Wow. That's genius.

1376
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:18,387

1378
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,324
Easy-peasy.

1379
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,159
SORA: That's a relief.

1380
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:24,927
Can we summon them with our cell phone?

1381
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:27,663
No, they don't have enough processing speed,

1382
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,265
but they can easily come in and out

01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:35,404
as long as I specify which one.

1386
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:38,040
T.K.: So, then, we can summon them any time?

1387
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:40,643
IZZY: Precisely. They'll either be here in this office

1388
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:43,212
or in the secure virtual cyberspace.

1389

SORA: Oh, my gosh. Look at the time!

1390
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:48,718
KARI: Good thing we don't have to take the stairs.

1391
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:50,019
T.K.: So, I guess nothing's changed between

1392
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:52,655
you and Tai since you didn't show up at Izzy's today.

1393
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:55,157
When are you guys gonna call a truce and work things out?

1394
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:56,459
Pouting about it's not helping.

1395
01:04:56,492 --> 01:04:58,060
Hey, I'm not pouting.

1396
01:04:58,094 --> 01:04:59,695
T.K.: If you say so. Anyway,

1397
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,731
we're all planning to meet up again Saturday.

1398
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:05,001
You better come this time. Later.

1399
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:11,173
The last thing we need to be doing right now

1400
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:12,475
is fighting each other.

1401
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:14,744
What if Kuwagamon comes back?

1402
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:16,679
We've got to pull together.

1403
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:20,716
KARI: Izzy, were you up all night?

1404
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:21,684
You look like a zombie.

1405
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:24,020
SORA: A zombie who hasn't eaten in a while.

1406
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:26,489
IZZY: I'm okay. I slept a little bit.

1407
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:28,457
What I was working on couldn't wait.

1408
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:30,493
And I finally finished these.

1409
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:32,728
-Try 'em, Tai. -TAI: Oh, yeah.

1410
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:37,300
If my calculations are correct,

1411
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:38,601
the goggles should let you see

1412
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:40,202
-the wavelength distortions. -Wow.

1413
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:42,338
TAI: These are even better than my old goggles.

1414
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:45,241
Tai, we're going to hang out in the digital room

1415
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:46,175
that Izzy made for us.

1416
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:48,277
If you need us, just call, okay?

1417
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:50,713
Can they just go through the screen on your laptop?

1418
01:05:50,746 --> 01:05:52,715
Yes, but as long as we're outside here,

1419
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:55,318
let's try a little test of the system.

1420
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:59,155
That ATM should be connected to the web.

1421
01:05:59,188 --> 01:06:01,190
Just call, and we'll come running.

1422
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:02,758
TAI: Thanks, Agumon.

1423
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,560
[ Electronic buzzing ]

1424
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:05,795
Well, that worked.

1425
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:07,263
SORA: What should we do now, Izzy?

1426
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:08,331
Let's test the goggles.

1427
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:11,033
My research shows that the wavelength distortions

1428
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:12,435
are easiest to see in places

1429
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:13,602
where there's a lot of data.

1430
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:16,138
So, Tai should be able to see the dataflow

1431
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:18,341
when he puts the goggles on.

1432
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:19,375
The different colored streams

1433
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:21,344
represent different types of data

1434
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:22,778
and how strong they are.

1435
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,314
When I connect the goggles to my server like this,

1436
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:27,183
you should see even more of them.

1437
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:28,551
TAI: Whoa. You're right, Izzy.

1438
01:06:28,584 --> 01:06:31,454
Now there's more streams, and the colors got brighter.

1439
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:33,489
The red streams are the ones that match up

1440
01:06:33,522 --> 01:06:35,324
the closest with the big distortions.

1441
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:36,459
And those are the ones we think

1442
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:39,295
the infected Digimon are coming through,

1443
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:41,063
so tracking the red streams

1444
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:42,665
may tell us when they're coming.

1445
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:45,134
Yeah. That would help.

1446
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,069
IZZY: This open area should be a good place

1447
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:48,270
to test that theory.

1448
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:50,239
Let's see if Tai spots any distortions

1449
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:52,608
that look like they might be dangerous.

but I ended up just getting lost myself.

1458

What exactly are you looking for?

1468
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:29,712
Well, it's, uh...

1469
01:07:29,745 --> 01:07:31,247
