He and Kurumi
were inseparable...

19
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,708
but there's an empty space
where he used to be.

20
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,250
Kurumi could
no longer smile...

00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,583
She could no longer sleep...

This isn't a task I can do.

If you agree, you
will take on a face.

Hal, please...
From today on, that is my name.

Ah... that's right.
Of course it is.

40
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,791
So, Hal...
how does it feel?

41
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,375
Being human?

42
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,791
I'm sorry... but...
what does "feel" mean?

43
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:23,291
[ARANAMI] Well, when a person
has feelings, they, uh... Hmm...

Forget I said anything!

Uh...

48
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,083
That takes me back,
all right...

49
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,333
May I?

50
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,333
Each face should be
only one color...

51
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,458
when you solve a face, the

will come true.

53
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,625
The girls were particularly
into these things back when

00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,250
I was a student...

If you've got one,

Oh! Forgive me... Forgot
who I was talking to.

I need to check on the ladies

62
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,041
and make sure
they're all right...

63
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,750
You be okay going on
by yourself, won't you?

64
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,333
Oh, hold on!

65
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,583
Take this.

66
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:52,250
Something about
Kurumi... but what?

67
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,333
[ARANAMI] Hal must've
written that one.

68
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:02,000
[HAL] It says
"Live with Kurumi."

69
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,083
Well, look at that.

70

[HAL] Yes, but I
didn't get far before

184
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,458

185
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,833
[ARANAMI] That happens

186

I don't understand. The

the object is priceless.

equal its value.

Zero means priceless...
which means important.

came here to the center,

241

she got into a huge
argument with her family.

242

of her belongings,

But... Kurumi had a
word with the family

247
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,291
and tracked down
every last thing.
