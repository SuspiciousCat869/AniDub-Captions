[Kazuto] Yeah.
Wait, who are you?

00:09:23.894 --> 00:09:25.631
I'm me.
Who are you?

But how?

The scan.

00:09:40.628 --> 00:09:41.863
<i>[Kazuto] There's</i>

<i>but how's it know my height</i>

00:09:49.646 --> 00:09:51.716
[Klein] When you first put
the NerveGear on,

00:09:51.783 --> 00:09:54.121
it had you do this
calibration thing.

00:09:54.188 --> 00:09:57.461
It asked you to touch your body
all over like this, remember?

00:09:57.528 --> 00:09:59.264
Oh, yeah.
You're right.

00:09:59.331 --> 00:10:01.435
That's where it got
our physical data.

00:10:01.503 --> 00:10:04.809
But this is‐‐
what's the point?

00:10:04.876 --> 00:10:06.847
Why would anyone do this to us?

00:10:07.247 --> 00:10:09.652
[Kazuto] I think he's about
to tell us.

00:10:10.353 --> 00:10:13.727
[Akihiko] Right now
you're probably wondering why.

00:10:13.794 --> 00:10:15.831
"Why would Akihiko Kayaba‐‐

00:10:15.898 --> 00:10:19.706
developer of 'Sword Art Online'
and NerveGear‐‐do this?"

00:10:20.908 --> 00:10:23.614
Ultimately, my goal
was a simple one.

00:10:24.148 --> 00:10:26.720
The reason I created
"Sword Art Online"

00:10:26.786 --> 00:10:29.959
was to control the fate
of a world of my design.

00:10:31.162 --> 00:10:32.732
Kayaba.

00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:36.172
[Akihiko] As you can see,
I have achieved my goal.

00:10:36.673 --> 00:10:39.712
[grunting]

00:10:40.213 --> 00:10:44.321
He made it to control the fate
of a world of his design, huh?

00:10:44.856 --> 00:10:47.060
That's the reason Kayaba
gave you guys?

00:10:47.127 --> 00:10:48.196
[Kazuto] Yeah.

00:10:48.262 --> 00:10:50.801
So what'd you think when
you heard him say that?

00:10:50.868 --> 00:10:52.070
[Kazuto] I dunno.

00:10:52.137 --> 00:10:53.707
I guess all I could think about

00:10:53.774 --> 00:10:55.578
was how I was gonna survive.

00:10:56.078 --> 00:10:58.750
There wasn't really time
to think about anything else.

00:10:59.953 --> 00:11:01.823
That's why I ditched Klein.

00:11:02.558 --> 00:11:03.794
To survive.

00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:07.668
Okay.

00:11:07.735 --> 00:11:09.806
If that's what you want,
I'll get going,

00:11:09.873 --> 00:11:12.410
but if you're in a jam,
message me, okay?

00:11:12.477 --> 00:11:13.714
Sure.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.185
I'll be seeing you, Klein.
Take care.

the boss was gonna use.

Most of the 1,000 people

00:14:56.125 --> 00:14:58.229

even know how to level up.

I made it to floors
that were higher

than any of the other testers.
That's a fact.

to reject Yui's
admin credentials.

00:44:43.163 --> 00:44:45.067
The only thing I could do
was take her program

00:44:45.134 --> 00:44:47.105
and turn it into a game object.

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.077
[Asuna] So this is...

00:44:50.879 --> 00:44:53.050

what Nobuyuki Sugou was up to,

00:53:38.768 --> 00:53:42.776
using those 300 comatose
"SAO" players as guinea pigs,

00:53:42.843 --> 00:53:45.414
you'd already gone in
and taken care of it.

00:53:45.481 --> 00:53:46.851
But why couldn't you stop him

00:53:46.917 --> 00:53:48.654
from doing it
in the first place?

00:53:48.721 --> 00:53:50.725
It's not like we weren't
keeping tabs on him.

00:53:50.792 --> 00:53:54.031
Sugou worked in
the same research lab as Kayaba.

00:53:54.833 --> 00:53:57.471
[Seijiro] There were 6,000
players coming back from "SAO"

00:53:57.539 --> 00:53:58.775
that needed us.

00:53:58.841 --> 00:54:00.712
We were swamped checking up
on their health

00:54:00.779 --> 00:54:03.718
and getting them adjusted
to the real world again.

00:54:04.152 --> 00:54:05.722
Our staff was stretched so thin,

00:54:05.789 --> 00:54:07.993
monitoring Sugou took
a backseat.

00:54:08.059 --> 00:54:09.328
That said,

00:54:09.395 --> 00:54:11.132
none of us even considered
the possibility

00:54:11.199 --> 00:54:15.007
of him building a lab inside
the game for his experiments,

00:54:15.073 --> 00:54:16.042
and in the real world,

00:54:16.109 --> 00:54:17.445
he gave us no indication he

00:54:17.512 --> 00:54:19.583
was involved
with anything shady.

00:54:20.117 --> 00:54:22.354
[Seijiro] Why don't you tell me
what happened in there?

00:54:22.956 --> 00:54:24.192
For starters,

00:54:24.258 --> 00:54:26.262
how do you know what Sugou
was up to?

00:54:26.329 --> 00:54:28.200
It's not like
I suspected anything.

00:54:28.266 --> 00:54:29.570
Not at first.

00:54:29.636 --> 00:54:31.272
[Man] This is Sugou.

00:54:31.339 --> 00:54:33.477
He's our company's director
of R&amp;D.

00:54:33.544 --> 00:54:35.314
I'm Nobuyuki Sugou.

00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:36.884
It's a pleasure.

00:54:37.552 --> 00:54:39.656
I'm Kazuto Kirigaya.

00:54:40.324 --> 00:54:42.529
[Man] Kazuto, take care.

00:54:48.841 --> 00:54:51.914
[Sugou] I heard you and Asuna
were lovers in the game.

00:54:51.981 --> 00:54:53.016
Is that true?

00:54:53.885 --> 00:54:55.053
Uh‐huh.

00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:56.624
That is unfortunate.

00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:59.128

for one complicated relationship

of Asuna like this.

Even though you're not
welcome here anymore,

00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:48.146
you should come to the wedding.

Didn't you think he
was suspicious after that?

00:57:08.286 --> 00:57:10.959
No, 'cause all I could
think about was Asuna.

you dove into "ALO"

to go on,
