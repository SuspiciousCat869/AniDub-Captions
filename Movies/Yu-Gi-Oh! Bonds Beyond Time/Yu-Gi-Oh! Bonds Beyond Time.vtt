00:00:38.573 --> 00:00:40.173 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh!

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:55.489 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hah!

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:59.894 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, those were
some close calls.

00:00:59.928 --> 00:01:02.396 position:5% line:83% align:start
Uh-oh! I got a feeling they're
about to get closer!

00:01:07.835 --> 00:01:10.337 position:33% line:83% align:start
How about
a little help, Neos?

00:01:11.706 --> 00:01:13.206 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uhh!

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:22.449 position:38% line:89% align:start
Jaden Yuki...

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:26.186 position:13% line:83% align:start
the duelist who they say
can speak with the spirits.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:29.023 position:38% line:83% align:start
I see my reputation
precedes me.

00:01:29.057 --> 00:01:31.593 position:7% line:83% align:start
So, he's the one behind
all of this destruction.

00:01:31.626 --> 00:01:34.328 position:38% line:77% align:start
I'd say so, Banner,
and it's pretty
impressive, too.

00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:35.830 position:33% line:89% align:start
I mean, wow.

00:01:35.863 --> 00:01:38.332 position:38% line:77% align:start
Bringing all of
these Duel Monsters
to real life?

00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:39.533 position:50% line:83% align:start
Don't be
too excited.

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:42.269 position:52% line:77% align:start
He is trying to
destroy you with
them, after all.

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:45.039 position:5% line:83% align:start
Jaden, I've finished
what I came here to do.

00:01:45.073 --> 00:01:46.239 position:38% line:89% align:start
Say what?

00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:48.776 position:5% line:83% align:start
Say good-bye,
because now I plan on

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.012 position:5% line:83% align:start
finishing you off,
as well.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.055 position:38% line:89% align:start
Aah!

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:02.189 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh-oh.

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:04.424 position:38% line:83% align:start
Whatever's coming,
I doubt it's good!

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:06.560 position:5% line:89% align:start
Farewell, Jaden!

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:07.862 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Alarm sounding]

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:10.130 position:27% line:83% align:start
Emergency alert.
Emergency alert.

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:12.566 position:5% line:89% align:start
Evacuate premises immediately.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.836 position:27% line:83% align:start
Evacuate premises
immediately.

00:02:19.707 --> 00:02:21.241 position:38% line:89% align:start
Look out!

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:24.177 position:16% line:89% align:start
Aah!

00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:25.813 position:38% line:89% align:start
Huh!

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:36.891 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yusei?

00:02:36.924 --> 00:02:40.227 position:38% line:83% align:start
You had that bad
dream again, huh?

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.262 position:5% line:83% align:start
If only it was
just a dream.

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:44.598 position:27% line:83% align:start
But it was so long ago,
and New Domino City has

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:45.833 position:21% line:89% align:start
rebuilt itself since

00:02:45.867 --> 00:02:48.201 position:27% line:83% align:start
your Father's research
was compromised.

00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:49.436 position:38% line:83% align:start
Right. You need
to stop trying to

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.238 position:38% line:83% align:start
change things that
can't be changed.

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:53.007 position:38% line:83% align:start
The past has passed,
and you need to

00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:55.009 position:38% line:83% align:start
let it go and
embrace the future.

00:02:55.043 --> 00:02:57.511 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's true, and you know
if I agree with Jack,

00:02:57.544 --> 00:02:59.113 position:5% line:89% align:start
I must really mean it.

00:02:59.147 --> 00:03:01.949 position:16% line:89% align:start
I wish it was that easy.

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.387 position:27% line:83% align:start
I bet I know what will
cheer you up, mate.

00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:10.590 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah. Come on, Yusei.
Let's ride!

00:03:10.624 --> 00:03:11.859 position:5% line:89% align:start
All right.

00:03:19.734 --> 00:03:21.803 position:5% line:83% align:start
YUSEI, VOICEOVER: Maybe one day,
I will be able to forget

00:03:21.836 --> 00:03:25.106 position:5% line:83% align:start
about all the pain my father's
research caused New Domino,

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:26.874 position:16% line:89% align:start
but that day isn't today.

00:03:26.908 --> 00:03:29.209 position:19% line:83% align:start
The people of this city
have suffered so much.

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:32.914 position:13% line:83% align:start
I have to do everything in
my power to keep them safe.

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:51.799 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hey, looks like we've
got a tailgater!

00:03:51.833 --> 00:03:54.902 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've never seen that
Duel Runner before.

00:03:54.936 --> 00:03:58.072 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah, or the duelist
that's driving it.

00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:00.742 position:38% line:89% align:start
I can't believe it.

00:04:00.775 --> 00:04:02.309 position:38% line:83% align:start
He's challenging us
to a duel!

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:04.812 position:5% line:83% align:start
If it's a duel he wants,
a duel he'll get.

00:04:04.846 --> 00:04:06.881 position:50% line:83% align:start
He's all yours,
Yusei. Do it!

00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:08.983 position:16% line:89% align:start
Duel Mode engaged.

00:04:09.016 --> 00:04:10.818 position:5% line:83% align:start
All right,
let's rev it up!

00:04:10.852 --> 00:04:13.087 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here we go!

00:04:31.239 --> 00:04:33.640 position:27% line:83% align:start
Whoever this guy is,
he's got some skills!

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:36.476 position:7% line:77% align:start
True, but just one
more attack, and this
duel is finished.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.213 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now, come on, Yusei.
It's time to take him down!

00:04:39.247 --> 00:04:40.747 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's time, old friend.

00:04:40.782 --> 00:04:42.582 position:27% line:89% align:start
Let's do this!

00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:53.593 position:24% line:89% align:start
I Synchro Summon...

00:04:53.627 --> 00:04:56.130 position:27% line:89% align:start
Stardust Dragon!

00:05:01.836 --> 00:05:03.905 position:38% line:89% align:start
I don't think so!

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.975 position:5% line:83% align:start
A blank card.
What is that for?

00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:30.797 position:38% line:89% align:start
Am I seeing things?

00:05:30.832 --> 00:05:32.066 position:38% line:83% align:start
Stardust
Dragon--it's--

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:33.868 position:5% line:89% align:start
Gone! Been stolen!

00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:36.436 position:27% line:89% align:start
But how could that be?

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:37.437 position:38% line:89% align:start
Ha ha ha!

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.174 position:24% line:83% align:start
A great many things
are possible, Yusei,

00:05:40.208 --> 00:05:42.676 position:27% line:83% align:start
and now that I have the
mighty Stardust Dragon,

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:46.881 position:21% line:77% align:start
the demise of
your era in time is
one of those things.

00:05:46.914 --> 00:05:48.481 position:5% line:89% align:start
Who are you?

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:49.816 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ha ha ha ha!

00:05:49.851 --> 00:05:51.618 position:50% line:89% align:start
Wait! Stop! Huh!

00:06:00.794 --> 00:06:03.231 position:50% line:89% align:start
Stardust.

00:06:07.168 --> 00:06:09.270 position:5% line:83% align:start
Would someone tell me
what just happened?

00:06:09.303 --> 00:06:11.239 position:16% line:83% align:start
I would, but I don't
know myself.

00:06:11.272 --> 00:06:13.773 position:27% line:83% align:start
I still can't believe
he took Stardust.

00:06:13.807 --> 00:06:16.878 position:5% line:77% align:start
Why did that maniac
take him--that's what
I'd like to know.

00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:18.112 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Door opens]

00:06:18.145 --> 00:06:19.646 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's up, guys?

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:21.615 position:38% line:89% align:start
Akiza, Leo, Luna.

00:06:21.648 --> 00:06:24.285 position:5% line:83% align:start
Look, no offense,
but this really isn't

00:06:24.318 --> 00:06:26.120 position:5% line:83% align:start
the best time
for a social call.

00:06:26.153 --> 00:06:28.189 position:16% line:83% align:start
Whoever said this
was social, Jack?

00:06:28.222 --> 00:06:30.024 position:16% line:83% align:start
We happen to be
here on business!

00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:31.292 position:64% line:83% align:start
Business?
What's up?

00:06:31.325 --> 00:06:32.927 position:30% line:83% align:start
Leo and I were
surfing the Web

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.663 position:13% line:83% align:start
researching Duel Monsters'
history when we saw this.

00:06:38.132 --> 00:06:39.633 position:50% line:83% align:start
Hey, I recognize
that guy.

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:42.602 position:5% line:83% align:start
I should hope so. That's
Maximillion Pegasus,

00:06:42.636 --> 00:06:44.906 position:5% line:83% align:start
the Chairman of
Industrial Illusions.

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:47.308 position:5% line:83% align:start
He's the creator
of Duel Monsters.

00:06:47.341 --> 00:06:50.144 position:50% line:83% align:start
And look who's
next to him!

00:06:50.177 --> 00:06:53.014 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yugi Muto, the King
of Games himself.

00:06:53.047 --> 00:06:54.481 position:27% line:83% align:start
They say he's
the best duelist

00:06:54.514 --> 00:06:56.150 position:27% line:83% align:start
to have ever
picked up a deck.

00:06:56.183 --> 00:06:57.617 position:5% line:83% align:start
Doesn't look
so tough to me.

00:06:57.651 --> 00:06:59.619 position:5% line:83% align:start
Of course, how could you
with that dated haircut?

00:06:59.653 --> 00:07:02.356 position:16% line:83% align:start
Still, even I admit,
he's a dueling legend.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.557 position:16% line:83% align:start
What I would give
to see Yugi in action

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:05.859 position:16% line:89% align:start
way back in his day.

00:07:05.892 --> 00:07:07.194 position:38% line:83% align:start
This is what you
wanted to show us?

00:07:07.228 --> 00:07:09.729 position:5% line:83% align:start
No. Scroll over
to the next page.

00:07:11.365 --> 00:07:13.301 position:38% line:83% align:start
Wait!
Stardust Dragon?

00:07:13.334 --> 00:07:15.102 position:16% line:83% align:start
But that card didn't
exist back then!

00:07:15.136 --> 00:07:16.971 position:5% line:89% align:start
Exactly our point!

00:07:17.004 --> 00:07:18.872 position:38% line:83% align:start
Look. The article
says that

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:20.707 position:38% line:83% align:start
all sorts of dragons
appeared one day

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.842 position:38% line:77% align:start
and, like,
blasted almost
all of Europe.

00:07:22.876 --> 00:07:25.578 position:16% line:83% align:start
But I don't remember
ever hearing about this,

00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:28.215 position:16% line:83% align:start
and this is a major
historical event!

00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:30.251 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's just it;
this is new history.

00:07:30.284 --> 00:07:32.619 position:5% line:83% align:start
Somehow, the past
has changed.

00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:34.454 position:24% line:89% align:start
Huh! Wait a minute.

00:07:35.957 --> 00:07:38.558 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's that duelist
from before.

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:39.526 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Rumbling]

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:41.362 position:5% line:83% align:start
What's going on
outside?

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:48.336 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't like the
looks of this, guys!

00:07:53.407 --> 00:07:55.042 position:61% line:83% align:start
Leo, what's
happening?

00:07:55.076 --> 00:07:56.776 position:27% line:89% align:start
Our city's vanishing!

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:57.979 position:16% line:89% align:start
But why?

00:07:58.012 --> 00:08:00.114 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe I've seen one
too many movies,

00:08:00.147 --> 00:08:02.482 position:5% line:83% align:start
but whenever something
changes in the past,

00:08:02.515 --> 00:08:04.951 position:5% line:83% align:start
isn't it supposed to
somehow change the future?

00:08:04.986 --> 00:08:06.220 position:50% line:89% align:start
Yeah. So?

00:08:06.253 --> 00:08:09.589 position:19% line:83% align:start
If past has changed,
that would mean that...

00:08:09.622 --> 00:08:12.726 position:16% line:83% align:start
Huh! What the masked man
said was true--

00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:17.431 position:16% line:83% align:start
our era, our period in time,
it's meeting its end!

00:08:17.465 --> 00:08:18.932 position:27% line:89% align:start
Uuhhh!

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:20.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
Huh?
Huh?

00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:25.272 position:38% line:83% align:start
It's the mark of
the Crimson Dragon!

00:08:25.306 --> 00:08:27.408 position:5% line:83% align:start
And look!
Its power is surging

00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:29.809 position:5% line:83% align:start
through Yusei's
Duel Runner, too!

Ahh!

00:08:36.317 --> 00:08:37.584 position:50% line:83% align:start
What are you
doing?

00:08:37.617 --> 00:08:40.187 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm not sure,
but it's calling to me!

00:08:43.757 --> 00:08:45.393 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't know where
you're taking me,

00:08:45.426 --> 00:08:46.960 position:27% line:83% align:start
but if it's somewhere
that'll give me

00:08:46.993 --> 00:08:49.497 position:27% line:83% align:start
a chance to stop this,
lead the way!

[Roaring]

00:08:51.965 --> 00:08:54.135 position:38% line:89% align:start
Let's go!

00:09:04.844 --> 00:09:06.880 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's some dragon!

00:09:06.913 --> 00:09:08.482 position:38% line:83% align:start
Know where
I could score one?

00:09:08.516 --> 00:09:13.054 position:5% line:83% align:start
Jaden Yuki--calm, cool,
and collected to the very end.

00:09:13.087 --> 00:09:14.522 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now perish!

00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:18.159 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh!

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:21.995 position:50% line:89% align:start
Neos!

00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:25.598 position:50% line:89% align:start
Aaaahh! Aaah!

00:09:32.139 --> 00:09:34.175 position:5% line:89% align:start
Finish him!

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:36.843 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uhh!

00:09:36.876 --> 00:09:38.379 position:38% line:89% align:start
[Roaring]

00:09:38.412 --> 00:09:40.181 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's this?

00:09:44.218 --> 00:09:46.253 position:24% line:89% align:start
My Stardust Dragon!

00:09:46.287 --> 00:09:48.888 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yusei! How you followed me
back in time,

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:51.358 position:5% line:83% align:start
I do not know,
but I do know

00:09:51.392 --> 00:09:54.195 position:5% line:83% align:start
it changes nothing
for you and Jaden!

00:09:54.228 --> 00:09:56.297 position:5% line:83% align:start
If you don't perish
by my hand,

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.064 position:5% line:83% align:start
the hands of time
will do you in.

00:09:58.099 --> 00:09:59.567 position:50% line:89% align:start
Hands of what?

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.668 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ha ha ha ha!

00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:03.204 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hold on!

00:10:11.579 --> 00:10:14.248 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh! Ahh...

00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:17.284 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, Yusei, right?

00:10:17.318 --> 00:10:19.386 position:5% line:83% align:start
Any chance you could
tell me what's going on--

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.189 position:5% line:83% align:start
or better yet, who that
masked dude was?

00:10:22.223 --> 00:10:23.656 position:38% line:89% align:start
I wish I knew.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.159 position:38% line:83% align:start
You took quite
a hit there.

00:10:25.192 --> 00:10:26.293 position:35% line:89% align:start
Are you OK?

00:10:26.327 --> 00:10:27.595 position:16% line:89% align:start
Who, me?

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:29.829 position:5% line:83% align:start
Aw, I'm all good.
Just a few scratches.

00:10:29.863 --> 00:10:31.232 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're a tough kid.

00:10:31.265 --> 00:10:33.066 position:27% line:83% align:start
Jaden--that's what
he called you, right?

00:10:33.099 --> 00:10:36.636 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yep. That's my name,
and dueling's my game.

00:10:36.669 --> 00:10:38.071 position:5% line:83% align:start
Of course,
it didn't seem like

00:10:38.104 --> 00:10:40.773 position:5% line:83% align:start
much of a game
to that guy, at all.

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.976 position:38% line:83% align:start
It's not. He has
another agenda.

00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:46.280 position:19% line:83% align:start
Whatever. I'll get
my payback. You'll see!

00:10:46.313 --> 00:10:48.382 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's quite the ride
you got there.

00:10:48.415 --> 00:10:50.717 position:16% line:83% align:start
Looks like something
out of the future.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.118 position:61% line:89% align:start
It is.

00:10:52.153 --> 00:10:54.155 position:27% line:83% align:start
It is? What do
you mean, it is?

00:10:54.188 --> 00:10:56.089 position:50% line:83% align:start
He means as he
says, Jaden.

00:10:56.122 --> 00:10:57.458 position:50% line:83% align:start
Yusei is from
another time.

00:10:57.491 --> 00:10:59.659 position:33% line:83% align:start
Another time?
Aw, quit messing with me.

00:10:59.692 --> 00:11:01.362 position:24% line:83% align:start
Besides, how would
you guys know?

00:11:01.395 --> 00:11:03.763 position:5% line:83% align:start
We know because, like you,
Yusei has a gift.

00:11:03.796 --> 00:11:05.999 position:38% line:83% align:start
A gift that connects
him to the world

00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:08.202 position:38% line:83% align:start
of Duel Monster
spirits.

00:11:08.235 --> 00:11:10.271 position:27% line:83% align:start
I think they mean
this mark.

00:11:10.304 --> 00:11:11.971 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, then, it looks
like you and I have

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:14.140 position:27% line:83% align:start
something new in
common, don't we, Yusei?

00:11:14.175 --> 00:11:16.577 position:38% line:83% align:start
Yes, Jaden. Now tell
me how this all

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.745 position:38% line:83% align:start
got started with you
and the masked man.

00:11:18.778 --> 00:11:20.780 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, some classmates
of mine kept reporting

00:11:20.813 --> 00:11:22.982 position:7% line:83% align:start
that their duel cards
were getting snatched.

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:27.321 position:5% line:83% align:start
I went looking for the thief
and found you-know-who.

00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:30.491 position:24% line:83% align:start
Listen, Jaden,
I know we just met,

00:11:30.524 --> 00:11:32.959 position:27% line:83% align:start
but believe me, we need
to stop this man,

00:11:32.992 --> 00:11:36.129 position:27% line:83% align:start
because if we don't,
life as you know it--

00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:38.199 position:30% line:83% align:start
well, won't be
as you know it.

00:11:38.232 --> 00:11:41.000 position:21% line:83% align:start
My time, your time--
it will all change.

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:44.137 position:27% line:83% align:start
And trust me, it's not
a change for the better.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.905 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hold up.
Are you asking me

00:11:45.939 --> 00:11:48.242 position:5% line:83% align:start
to team up with you
to take this dude down?

00:11:48.275 --> 00:11:50.176 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's right, Jaden.

00:11:50.211 --> 00:11:51.945 position:7% line:83% align:start
Sweet! But, uh,
how are we gonna

00:11:51.978 --> 00:11:54.047 position:5% line:83% align:start
take him down if
he's not even here?

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.349 position:5% line:89% align:start
I mean, the dude split.

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:57.418 position:27% line:83% align:start
I know. My guess is
he hopped back in time

00:11:57.451 --> 00:11:59.386 position:24% line:83% align:start
to the era when he
makes his big move,

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:00.720 position:27% line:89% align:start
when he changes history

00:12:00.753 --> 00:12:02.323 position:30% line:83% align:start
and alters the
future forever.

00:12:02.356 --> 00:12:03.691 position:5% line:83% align:start
Whoa, whoa!
What do you mean

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:05.959 position:5% line:83% align:start
"changes history"
and "alters the future"?

00:12:05.992 --> 00:12:07.494 position:5% line:89% align:start
History hasn't changed.

00:12:07.528 --> 00:12:08.728 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here, I'll show you.

00:12:08.761 --> 00:12:11.130 position:16% line:83% align:start
Let me check the
Domino City database

00:12:11.164 --> 00:12:13.300 position:19% line:83% align:start
for a newspaper article
that'll prove to you

00:12:13.334 --> 00:12:14.968 position:16% line:89% align:start
that history has--

00:12:15.001 --> 00:12:16.503 position:16% line:89% align:start
Completely changed!

00:12:16.537 --> 00:12:18.505 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, and not
for the better!

00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:19.973 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why is this guy
doing all of this?

00:12:20.006 --> 00:12:22.376 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't know, but he's
doing it as we speak!

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:24.077 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh! No way!

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:25.979 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, as long as I got--

00:12:26.012 --> 00:12:28.482 position:5% line:89% align:start
Neos is gone! Oh!

00:12:28.515 --> 00:12:31.285 position:38% line:83% align:start
Then it's
starting here, too.

00:12:31.318 --> 00:12:33.753 position:38% line:83% align:start

00:12:35.656 --> 00:12:37.524 position:38% line:89% align:start
now everything else!

So what are we supposed
to do now, Yusei?

00:12:44.465 --> 00:12:45.898 position:50% line:89% align:start
Now we move!

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:47.066 position:16% line:89% align:start

This certainly is
a good turnout.

It's wonderful to see you,

as wonderful as it is

00:13:27.708 --> 00:13:31.144 position:30% line:83% align:start

Ha ha ha ha!

At last, my work
is complete.

00:15:03.002 --> 00:15:06.673 position:7% line:83% align:start
It took some doing, but history
is now forever changed--

changed so that

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.168 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:35.201 --> 00:15:37.403 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's OK, Yugi.
You're safe now.

00:15:37.438 --> 00:15:39.706 position:38% line:83% align:start
Where am I?
Is my Grandpa OK?

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:40.908 position:38% line:89% align:start
Where's Pegasus?

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.710 position:38% line:83% align:start
Wait. Was it all
just a dream?

00:15:43.744 --> 00:15:45.178 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm afraid not.

00:15:45.211 --> 00:15:46.547 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here's the deal, bro;

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.816 position:5% line:83% align:start
it's not about where
you are, but when.

00:15:48.849 --> 00:15:50.451 position:30% line:83% align:start
We've taken you
back in time,

00:15:50.484 --> 00:15:54.020 position:13% line:83% align:start
back to just before those
Dragons blasted this place.

00:15:56.857 --> 00:15:59.425 position:38% line:83% align:start
Look!
Neos is back!

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:00.727 position:5% line:89% align:start
Who are you guys?

00:16:00.761 --> 00:16:03.229 position:27% line:89% align:start
My name is Yusei Fudo.

00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:05.566 position:16% line:89% align:start
And I'm Jaden Yuki.

00:16:05.599 --> 00:16:08.201 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yusei and Jaden.
I'm Yugi Muto.

00:16:08.234 --> 00:16:11.437 position:38% line:77% align:start
Oh, there's no need
to tell us who
you are. We know.

00:16:11.472 --> 00:16:13.874 position:5% line:89% align:start
You do? How's that?

00:16:13.907 --> 00:16:16.375 position:13% line:83% align:start
Because we're from the
future. It's no big whoop.

00:16:16.409 --> 00:16:17.678 position:5% line:89% align:start
What?

00:16:17.711 --> 00:16:19.412 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, I guess it's
kind of a big whoop.

00:16:19.445 --> 00:16:21.748 position:16% line:83% align:start
Bottom line, though,
we're here to save the world.

00:16:21.782 --> 00:16:24.918 position:50% line:77% align:start
That masked man
you saw--he must
be stopped.

00:16:24.952 --> 00:16:26.720 position:52% line:83% align:start
Like you,
we've seen

00:16:26.753 --> 00:16:29.121 position:50% line:83% align:start
what happens
if he's not.

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:31.224 position:27% line:83% align:start
This guy seems
like he's made it

00:16:31.257 --> 00:16:33.494 position:27% line:83% align:start
his mission in life
to take down Pegasus.

00:16:33.527 --> 00:16:34.795 position:16% line:89% align:start
But why?

00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:36.964 position:38% line:83% align:start
Well, we're not sure
about that just yet,

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:38.565 position:38% line:83% align:start
but we do know
this much.

00:16:38.599 --> 00:16:39.900 position:38% line:89% align:start
If Pegasus goes,

00:16:39.933 --> 00:16:41.535 position:41% line:83% align:start
the Duel Monsters
world he created--

00:16:41.568 --> 00:16:43.135 position:27% line:83% align:start
It goes with him,
along with

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:44.638 position:24% line:83% align:start
all the things that
sprang from it,

00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:47.440 position:27% line:83% align:start
like schools, cities,
people---you name it.

00:16:47.473 --> 00:16:49.676 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, man!

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:51.512 position:5% line:83% align:start
But it doesn't have
to be that way.

00:16:51.545 --> 00:16:52.913 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's why we're here.

00:16:52.946 --> 00:16:55.549 position:38% line:77% align:start
Together we
might be able to
stop this maniac.

00:16:55.582 --> 00:16:57.383 position:38% line:89% align:start
Will you help us?

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:04.725 position:5% line:89% align:start
That guy hurt my Grandpa,

00:17:04.758 --> 00:17:07.694 position:5% line:83% align:start
and it sounds like
he's also trying

00:17:07.728 --> 00:17:09.897 position:5% line:89% align:start
to hurt the game I love,

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.164 position:5% line:83% align:start
so I'm more than
willing to help you two

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:13.432 position:5% line:89% align:start
any way that I can.

00:17:13.466 --> 00:17:16.335 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's make this guy sorry
he ever messed with us!

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.137 position:50% line:83% align:start
Glad to have you
on our side.

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:19.305 position:16% line:89% align:start
Glad? Try ecstatic!

00:17:19.338 --> 00:17:21.440 position:19% line:83% align:start
We've got the King
of Games in our corner!

00:17:21.474 --> 00:17:23.042 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now let's do this!

00:17:26.847 --> 00:17:29.048 position:38% line:83% align:start
Nice job scaring
them off!

00:17:29.081 --> 00:17:30.249 position:38% line:83% align:start
That's right,
everyone.

00:17:30.283 --> 00:17:32.118 position:38% line:83% align:start
Keep running,
and don't look back!

00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:34.086 position:5% line:83% align:start
I hope this
scares off Pegasus.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.155 position:5% line:83% align:start
That way, he won't be
crushed by that building.

00:17:36.188 --> 00:17:39.458 position:38% line:77% align:start
Right. Then he and
the future of Duel
Monsters are safe.

00:17:39.492 --> 00:17:41.260 position:27% line:89% align:start
I think not!

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.070 position:27% line:83% align:start
You listen here! We know
what you're up to,

00:17:51.103 --> 00:17:53.840 position:27% line:83% align:start
and we're not gonna
let it happen. Got it?

00:17:53.874 --> 00:17:55.876 position:5% line:83% align:start
So why don't you just
make it easy on yourself

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:58.579 position:5% line:83% align:start
and go back to wherever
it is you came from!

00:17:58.612 --> 00:18:01.514 position:27% line:83% align:start
Where I came from
is why I'm here.

00:18:01.547 --> 00:18:04.618 position:16% line:89% align:start
Perhaps it's time...

00:18:04.651 --> 00:18:06.687 position:16% line:89% align:start
we get acquainted.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.387 position:16% line:89% align:start
The name is Paradox.

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:09.756 position:38% line:89% align:start
Paradox?

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.357 position:5% line:83% align:start
I doubt that
you've heard of me.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.894 position:5% line:83% align:start
In fact, I'm very much
certain that you haven't.

00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:16.897 position:5% line:83% align:start
After all, I don't come
from any of your eras in time.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.531 position:5% line:89% align:start
I come from the future.

00:18:18.564 --> 00:18:20.132 position:35% line:83% align:start
What's that
supposed to mean?

00:18:20.166 --> 00:18:22.636 position:38% line:77% align:start
Forget him.
He's just trying to
get in your head.

00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:24.103 position:5% line:83% align:start
We don't care about
your backstory.

00:18:24.136 --> 00:18:26.405 position:5% line:83% align:start
We just care about
keeping our world safe!

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:28.174 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, is that so?

00:18:28.207 --> 00:18:30.077 position:24% line:89% align:start
Ha ha ha! Too bad.

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:33.312 position:16% line:83% align:start
Nobody thought to keep me
safe, or those I loved,

00:18:33.346 --> 00:18:35.782 position:16% line:83% align:start
and now I will finally
have my revenge.

00:18:35.816 --> 00:18:37.017 position:16% line:89% align:start
I will rid the world

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:39.151 position:16% line:83% align:start
of what caused all
my pain and suffering.

00:18:39.185 --> 00:18:42.254 position:19% line:83% align:start
That is why I am here,
because I've realized something

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:45.424 position:5% line:83% align:start
about this game you love so,
this Duel Monsters.

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:47.526 position:16% line:83% align:start
The world would be a far
better place without it.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.329 position:13% line:83% align:start
The monsters, the spells--
what good has come from it?

00:18:50.363 --> 00:18:52.032 position:27% line:83% align:start
True, you've all
saved the world

00:18:52.065 --> 00:18:54.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
many times over with
your precious cards,

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.769 position:19% line:89% align:start
but against adversaries

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:57.738 position:19% line:83% align:start
who were using the same
cards to destroy it.

00:18:57.771 --> 00:18:59.238 position:38% line:83% align:start
So that's
why you're here?

00:18:59.271 --> 00:19:01.607 position:38% line:83% align:start
To rid the world
of Duel Monsters?

00:19:01.642 --> 00:19:03.810 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's correct,
once and for all.

00:19:03.844 --> 00:19:05.812 position:38% line:83% align:start
Not on our watch,
you won't!

00:19:05.846 --> 00:19:07.446 position:5% line:89% align:start
You senseless dolts!

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.749 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't you see?

00:19:08.782 --> 00:19:10.117 position:5% line:89% align:start
Instead of trying to stop me,

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:12.585 position:5% line:83% align:start
you three should be trying
your best to help me!

00:19:12.618 --> 00:19:16.823 position:5% line:83% align:start
I told you--where I come from
is the reason that I am here.

00:19:16.857 --> 00:19:19.558 position:5% line:83% align:start
Where I come from is
a doomed future!

00:19:19.592 --> 00:19:20.661 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh!

00:19:20.694 --> 00:19:22.696 position:38% line:83% align:start
No. Our future is
a bright one.

00:19:22.729 --> 00:19:26.298 position:38% line:83% align:start
It's not.
It is a desolate place,

00:19:26.332 --> 00:19:29.535 position:16% line:83% align:start
so desolate I could
no longer bear to see it

00:19:29.568 --> 00:19:30.569 position:16% line:89% align:start
through my own eyes.

00:19:30.603 --> 00:19:32.238 position:16% line:89% align:start
I took to wearing a mask,

00:19:32.271 --> 00:19:36.009 position:5% line:83% align:start
and it was through this filter
that I finally began to see--

00:19:36.043 --> 00:19:38.277 position:21% line:83% align:start
see why things
had ended this way,

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:41.280 position:24% line:83% align:start
and the answer
was Duel Monsters.

00:19:41.313 --> 00:19:44.283 position:16% line:83% align:start
So what better way
to destroy this virus

00:19:44.316 --> 00:19:46.485 position:16% line:83% align:start
than by traveling
back to the beginning

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:48.554 position:13% line:89% align:start
and not letting it spread?

00:19:48.587 --> 00:19:52.059 position:16% line:83% align:start
Time travel is no easy feat,
but where there's a will,

00:19:52.092 --> 00:19:55.162 position:24% line:83% align:start
there's a way,
and there was a will.

00:19:55.194 --> 00:19:56.797 position:38% line:83% align:start
But don't you
realize?

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.999 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're not just wiping
out Duel Monsters,

00:19:59.032 --> 00:20:00.867 position:27% line:89% align:start
but people, too!

00:20:00.901 --> 00:20:02.668 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're destroying
everything and everyone

00:20:02.703 --> 00:20:04.104 position:30% line:83% align:start
ever touched by
the game!

00:20:04.137 --> 00:20:05.972 position:35% line:83% align:start
Of course
I realize that, Yusei.

00:20:06.006 --> 00:20:07.406 position:16% line:89% align:start
As a matter of fact,

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.608 position:19% line:83% align:start
that's what I'm looking
forward to the most.

00:20:09.642 --> 00:20:11.343 position:38% line:83% align:start
You're
one sick puppy!

00:20:11.377 --> 00:20:12.913 position:27% line:83% align:start
Maybe the game's
not perfect,

00:20:12.946 --> 00:20:14.915 position:16% line:83% align:start
but it's created more
good things than bad!

00:20:14.948 --> 00:20:16.215 position:24% line:89% align:start
And another thing--

00:20:16.248 --> 00:20:17.516 position:24% line:83% align:start
the future
isn't written yet.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.418 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's still time for
things to change!

00:20:19.452 --> 00:20:22.354 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, then, it seems we have
a difference of opinion,

00:20:22.388 --> 00:20:24.825 position:5% line:83% align:start
and since I doubt
any more words

00:20:24.858 --> 00:20:26.193 position:5% line:89% align:start
will settle our impasse,

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:27.828 position:5% line:83% align:start
perhaps we should seek
to settle it another way.

00:20:27.861 --> 00:20:29.628 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you're saying
you want to duel,

00:20:29.662 --> 00:20:31.131 position:27% line:89% align:start
bring it on, Paradox!

00:20:31.164 --> 00:20:34.333 position:5% line:83% align:start
Fine, then. I think it fitting
to destroy the three of you

00:20:34.366 --> 00:20:37.037 position:5% line:83% align:start
with the very cards that
you're trying to save.

00:20:44.845 --> 00:20:46.378 position:61% line:89% align:start
Huh!

00:20:51.985 --> 00:20:56.022 position:38% line:83% align:start
Paradox, get ready
to get your game on!

00:20:56.056 --> 00:20:58.491 position:16% line:83% align:start
Your twisted time crusade
stops here.

00:20:58.524 --> 00:20:59.926 position:27% line:89% align:start
Let's rev it up!

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.261 position:50% line:83% align:start
Yugi, out of
all our duels,

00:21:02.294 --> 00:21:03.729 position:50% line:83% align:start
this may be
the toughest.

00:21:03.764 --> 00:21:06.099 position:27% line:83% align:start
Then let's rise
to the challenge.

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:16.509 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yu-Gi-Oh!

00:21:16.542 --> 00:21:19.612 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have just one thing
to say to you, Paradox.

00:21:19.645 --> 00:21:20.947 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's time to duel!

00:21:20.981 --> 00:21:22.983 position:16% line:83% align:start
Let's go!
Let's go!

00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:34.660 position:27% line:89% align:start
Wish them luck, Pharaoh.

00:21:34.693 --> 00:21:37.429 position:27% line:83% align:start
The fate of us all now
rests with these three.

00:21:37.463 --> 00:21:40.533 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll go first,
and I think I'll start

00:21:40.566 --> 00:21:44.570 position:5% line:83% align:start
by activating the
field spell Malefic World.

00:22:00.352 --> 00:22:03.322 position:50% line:83% align:start
Ohh! What just
happened?

00:22:03.355 --> 00:22:04.557 position:27% line:89% align:start
Malefic World!

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:06.860 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now, instead of drawing a
card during my Draw Phase,

00:22:06.893 --> 00:22:10.163 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm allowed to add a random
Malefic monster from my deck

00:22:10.197 --> 00:22:12.032 position:16% line:89% align:start
directly to my hand.

00:22:12.065 --> 00:22:14.234 position:30% line:83% align:start
Next, I'll send
Cyber End Dragon

00:22:14.267 --> 00:22:16.335 position:24% line:83% align:start
from my Extra Deck
to the graveyard,

00:22:16.368 --> 00:22:20.073 position:16% line:83% align:start
which means Malefic Cyber
End Dragon now appears!

00:22:24.845 --> 00:22:26.146 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hey, does anyone know

00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:28.181 position:27% line:83% align:start
what this Malefic thing
is all about?

00:22:28.215 --> 00:22:29.715 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's not some "thing."

00:22:29.748 --> 00:22:32.219 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's the type of deck I use,
a type from the future--

00:22:32.252 --> 00:22:34.254 position:5% line:83% align:start
one of the many advantages
of time travel.

00:22:34.287 --> 00:22:36.156 position:16% line:83% align:start
Jaden, did you see
how he just summoned

00:22:36.189 --> 00:22:38.158 position:16% line:83% align:start
the Malefic version
of that Dragon?

00:22:38.191 --> 00:22:39.825 position:38% line:83% align:start
Uh-huh.
Just by banishing

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:42.128 position:38% line:77% align:start
the regular version
of Cyber End
to the graveyard.

00:22:42.162 --> 00:22:43.662 position:38% line:89% align:start
That's all it took!

00:22:43.696 --> 00:22:46.099 position:7% line:83% align:start
In other words, by destroying a
monster's good version,

00:22:46.132 --> 00:22:47.833 position:16% line:89% align:start
he can give life to its bad.

00:22:47.868 --> 00:22:49.568 position:27% line:83% align:start
It seems Paradox
truly does see

00:22:49.602 --> 00:22:51.537 position:24% line:83% align:start
only the dark side
in Duel Monsters.

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:55.075 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes, Yugi, and I'm going to
use it to defeat you all!

00:22:55.108 --> 00:22:57.978 position:5% line:83% align:start
But let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

00:22:58.011 --> 00:23:00.180 position:5% line:83% align:start
I end my turn
with one facedown.

00:23:00.213 --> 00:23:03.116 position:16% line:89% align:start
Listen, Jaden, Yugi.

00:23:03.149 --> 00:23:04.885 position:27% line:83% align:start
We know what's
at stake here.

00:23:04.918 --> 00:23:07.020 position:27% line:83% align:start
Our friends,
our very future--

00:23:07.053 --> 00:23:08.621 position:16% line:89% align:start
it all hangs in the balance.

00:23:08.654 --> 00:23:10.223 position:13% line:89% align:start
It all hinges on this duel.

00:23:10.257 --> 00:23:12.758 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's true we may
all have just met

00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:15.494 position:5% line:83% align:start
and may not know each other's
duel styles and strategies,

00:23:15.527 --> 00:23:19.531 position:19% line:83% align:start
but even so, right now,
we have to fight as one.

00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:23.669 position:16% line:83% align:start
All our skills, all our past
experiences, let's use them.

00:23:23.702 --> 00:23:26.605 position:16% line:83% align:start
Let's focus all of them
to this one common cause!

00:23:26.639 --> 00:23:28.008 position:61% line:89% align:start
Mm.

00:23:28.041 --> 00:23:29.541 position:16% line:89% align:start
Mm.

00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:33.213 position:5% line:83% align:start
Agreed, Yusei. And I
think that you should be

00:23:33.246 --> 00:23:34.813 position:5% line:89% align:start
the one to start us off.

00:23:34.847 --> 00:23:36.615 position:38% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:23:36.649 --> 00:23:38.450 position:35% line:89% align:start
Here we go!

00:23:38.484 --> 00:23:42.222 position:13% line:83% align:start
First I play the spell card
Reincarnation of Hope!

00:23:42.255 --> 00:23:44.391 position:19% line:83% align:start
By sending two monsters
to the graveyard now,

00:23:44.423 --> 00:23:46.525 position:24% line:83% align:start
we can draw a
monster card later.

00:23:46.558 --> 00:23:48.727 position:5% line:83% align:start
Fool! Don't you realize
there won't be a later

00:23:48.761 --> 00:23:50.163 position:5% line:89% align:start
for you or your friends?

00:23:50.196 --> 00:23:53.400 position:16% line:5% align:start
Well, right now I'm
summoning Junk Synchron!

00:23:53.432 --> 00:23:55.668 position:16% line:83% align:start
And because I was able
to summon him,

00:23:55.701 --> 00:23:58.271 position:27% line:83% align:start
now I can summon
a Level 2-or-below monster

00:23:58.305 --> 00:23:59.672 position:24% line:89% align:start
from my graveyard!

00:23:59.705 --> 00:24:03.809 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sonic Chick, fan your
feathers in defense mode!

00:24:03.842 --> 00:24:06.413 position:16% line:83% align:start
Next I'll play Quillbolt
Hedgehog's ability

00:24:06.445 --> 00:24:08.547 position:16% line:83% align:start
from my graveyard--
an ability that,

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:11.251 position:5% line:83% align:start
since I have a Tuner Monster
already on the field,

00:24:11.284 --> 00:24:14.087 position:7% line:5% align:start
allows me to summon my Hedgehog
straight to the field.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.956 position:30% line:5% align:start
But it won't be
around for long,

00:24:15.989 --> 00:24:18.058 position:24% line:83% align:start
nor will any of
my other monsters,

00:24:18.091 --> 00:24:19.692 position:16% line:83% align:start
at least not in their
present form,

00:24:19.725 --> 00:24:21.727 position:16% line:83% align:start
because I'm tuning
them all together.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.530 position:13% line:83% align:start
Just as Yugi, Jaden, and I
are combining our might,

00:24:24.563 --> 00:24:27.733 position:21% line:83% align:start
these three have
now combined theirs.

00:24:27.766 --> 00:24:32.571 position:13% line:83% align:start
I summon forth the Synchro
Monster, Junk Gardna!

00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:37.243 position:27% line:89% align:start
Synchro what?

00:24:37.277 --> 00:24:40.246 position:38% line:83% align:start
I don't know, but I
like it. Too cool!

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.949 position:13% line:83% align:start
I place two cards facedown
and end my turn.

00:24:43.984 --> 00:24:45.784 position:5% line:89% align:start
How truly pathetic.

00:24:45.818 --> 00:24:47.519 position:5% line:83% align:start
If that's the best you
can do, then you all

00:24:47.553 --> 00:24:49.922 position:5% line:83% align:start
might as well just
give up here and now.

00:24:49.955 --> 00:24:51.724 position:5% line:83% align:start
Your decks are
no match for mine,

00:24:51.757 --> 00:24:54.626 position:5% line:83% align:start
not since I snatched
Yusei's Stardust Dragon.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:55.928 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's my move!

00:24:55.961 --> 00:24:58.697 position:5% line:83% align:start
And with it, I'll show you
a beast with true might.

00:24:58.731 --> 00:25:01.900 position:5% line:83% align:start
I send Rainbow Dragon from
my deck to the graveyard,

00:25:01.934 --> 00:25:03.370 position:5% line:89% align:start
which, as you saw before,

00:25:03.403 --> 00:25:06.672 position:5% line:83% align:start
means I can summon
Malefic Rainbow Dragon!

00:25:16.715 --> 00:25:17.716 position:38% line:89% align:start
How dare you!

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:19.386 position:38% line:83% align:start
Leave my pal's
card out of this!

00:25:19.419 --> 00:25:21.653 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now we know why he was
stealing those cards.

00:25:21.687 --> 00:25:23.023 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why do you think
I was time-hopping

00:25:23.056 --> 00:25:24.457 position:5% line:89% align:start
in the first place?

00:25:24.491 --> 00:25:26.192 position:5% line:83% align:start
So I could
collect the cards

00:25:26.226 --> 00:25:28.061 position:7% line:83% align:start
I would need to
destroy Pegasus.

00:25:28.094 --> 00:25:29.695 position:5% line:89% align:start
But till that time comes,

00:25:29.728 --> 00:25:33.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll use them to destroy
the three of you!

00:25:33.166 --> 00:25:36.069 position:5% line:83% align:start
Malefic Rainbow Dragon,
attack!

00:25:36.102 --> 00:25:37.803 position:5% line:89% align:start
Spectral Surge!

00:25:39.506 --> 00:25:42.641 position:16% line:83% align:start
I play Junk Gardna's
ability, and with it,

00:25:42.674 --> 00:25:46.446 position:13% line:83% align:start
your Dragon is about to get
switched into defense mode.

00:25:49.948 --> 00:25:53.386 position:13% line:83% align:start
Fine, then. You stopped
one of my Malefic Dragons,

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:56.156 position:16% line:83% align:start
but as you recall,
I have two out.

00:25:56.189 --> 00:25:59.225 position:16% line:83% align:start
Malefic Cyber End Dragon,
attack!

00:26:03.729 --> 00:26:04.797 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uhh!

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:06.665 position:38% line:89% align:start
Ohh...

00:26:06.698 --> 00:26:07.966 position:61% line:89% align:start
Are you OK?

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.635 position:5% line:89% align:start
Say something, pal!

00:26:09.668 --> 00:26:10.969 position:38% line:89% align:start
I'm all right.

00:26:11.003 --> 00:26:13.306 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, you won't be when
your life points run out,

00:26:13.339 --> 00:26:15.607 position:5% line:83% align:start
because in a Malefic
duel, you don't just lose

00:26:15.641 --> 00:26:17.477 position:5% line:83% align:start
the match,
you lose your soul.

00:26:21.481 --> 00:26:24.317 position:16% line:83% align:start
I play Junk Gardna's
second ability!

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:26.286 position:16% line:83% align:start
When it's destroyed,
it switches

00:26:26.319 --> 00:26:29.289 position:16% line:83% align:start
one of your monsters
into defense mode.

00:26:29.322 --> 00:26:32.057 position:13% line:83% align:start
And next I play the trap--
Miracle's Wake!

00:26:32.092 --> 00:26:35.027 position:13% line:83% align:start
It allows me to wake up
a monster from my graveyard

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.862 position:24% line:83% align:start
that was destroyed
this turn.

00:26:39.466 --> 00:26:42.368 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry. I lost us
some points there.

00:26:42.402 --> 00:26:43.936 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't be sorry, Yusei.

00:26:43.969 --> 00:26:45.438 position:24% line:83% align:start
Totally.
You just fended off

00:26:45.472 --> 00:26:47.606 position:27% line:83% align:start
attacks from two
super-tough monsters!

00:26:47.639 --> 00:26:48.607 position:35% line:89% align:start
Way to go!

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.144 position:30% line:83% align:start
Thanks, guys.
I did my best.

00:26:51.177 --> 00:26:52.811 position:5% line:83% align:start
Against a deck that
is stacked with

00:26:52.845 --> 00:26:54.847 position:5% line:83% align:start
the best cards
throughout all of time,

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.149 position:5% line:89% align:start
that's all we can do,

00:26:56.182 --> 00:26:57.950 position:5% line:83% align:start
and that's what we're
going to have to keep doing

00:26:57.983 --> 00:26:59.651 position:5% line:89% align:start
to win this duel!

00:26:59.685 --> 00:27:01.620 position:16% line:83% align:start
In my time travels,
I've listened in on

00:27:01.653 --> 00:27:03.490 position:16% line:89% align:start
some of your past pep talks,

00:27:03.523 --> 00:27:06.559 position:16% line:83% align:start
but that was by far
your most pathetic.

00:27:06.593 --> 00:27:09.395 position:19% line:83% align:start
I place a card facedown
and end my turn.

00:27:09.429 --> 00:27:10.662 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well, all right, then,

00:27:10.696 --> 00:27:12.965 position:21% line:83% align:start
it's my turn to take
a crack at you!

00:27:12.998 --> 00:27:14.501 position:27% line:89% align:start
Here goes!

00:27:14.534 --> 00:27:17.470 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yusei, cool if I
piggyback off your play?

00:27:17.504 --> 00:27:19.771 position:27% line:83% align:start
All right.
Then I play this!

00:27:19.805 --> 00:27:22.408 position:27% line:83% align:start
Polymerization
now fuses Junk Gardna

00:27:22.442 --> 00:27:25.245 position:27% line:83% align:start
with Elemental Hero Neos
that's in my hand!

00:27:26.546 --> 00:27:28.348 position:27% line:83% align:start
This is a first--
two monsters

00:27:28.381 --> 00:27:31.251 position:13% line:83% align:start
from different times
teaming up together as one!

00:27:31.284 --> 00:27:33.685 position:16% line:83% align:start
Here comes the best
of both worlds,

00:27:33.719 --> 00:27:36.589 position:16% line:83% align:start
the Elemental Hero
Neos Knight!

00:27:39.124 --> 00:27:42.629 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now Elemental Neos Knight
gets a supercharged power

00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:46.266 position:7% line:83% align:start
equal to half the attack points
of Yusei's Junk Gardna.

00:27:47.766 --> 00:27:51.103 position:5% line:83% align:start
And you better believe I'm gonna
put that power to good use.

00:27:51.136 --> 00:27:52.704 position:19% line:89% align:start
So charge, Neos Knight!

00:27:52.738 --> 00:27:55.974 position:13% line:83% align:start
Vanquish that Malefic Cyber
End Dragon!

00:28:03.815 --> 00:28:06.818 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, and by the way,
Neos Knight's ability

00:28:06.852 --> 00:28:09.922 position:27% line:83% align:start
allows him two attacks
in this one battle!

00:28:09.955 --> 00:28:11.524 position:5% line:89% align:start
Two attacks?

00:28:18.565 --> 00:28:19.998 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're not so tough.

00:28:20.032 --> 00:28:21.833 position:38% line:77% align:start
Well done, Jaden.
I've heard of
knights slaying

00:28:21.867 --> 00:28:23.769 position:38% line:83% align:start
dragons before,
but not two at once.

00:28:23.802 --> 00:28:25.103 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ha ha!

00:28:25.137 --> 00:28:27.773 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's see if you're still
smiling after this.

00:28:27.806 --> 00:28:29.808 position:5% line:83% align:start
I play the trap
Malefic Tune.

00:28:31.777 --> 00:28:34.514 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now, since a Malefic
monster has been destroyed,

00:28:34.547 --> 00:28:36.882 position:33% line:83% align:start
I get to draw
two cards from my deck.

00:28:36.915 --> 00:28:41.153 position:38% line:77% align:start
Fine. Then I play
four cards facedown
to end my turn.

00:28:41.186 --> 00:28:42.721 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nicely played, Jaden.

00:28:42.754 --> 00:28:44.624 position:5% line:83% align:start
You have to tell me,
where did you learn

00:28:44.657 --> 00:28:47.227 position:7% line:83% align:start
to duel with such
heart and passion?

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:49.761 position:21% line:83% align:start
A little place
called Duel Academy.

00:28:49.795 --> 00:28:52.332 position:27% line:83% align:start
And believe it or not,
I usually skip class.

00:28:52.365 --> 00:28:54.132 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, if I were
your teacher,

00:28:54.166 --> 00:28:56.735 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'd definitely give you
an "A" on that last move.

00:28:56.768 --> 00:28:59.472 position:35% line:77% align:start
YUSEI, VOICEOVER:
I sure hope the people
of New Domino City

00:28:59.505 --> 00:29:01.740 position:27% line:83% align:start
give me passing
marks after this.

00:29:01.773 --> 00:29:04.677 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's my turn,
but instead of drawing,

00:29:04.711 --> 00:29:05.944 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll use my field spell

00:29:05.978 --> 00:29:09.047 position:5% line:83% align:start
to add a random Malefic
monster to my hand.

00:29:09.081 --> 00:29:10.483 position:16% line:89% align:start
Excellent!

00:29:10.516 --> 00:29:11.850 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now I have all that I need

00:29:11.883 --> 00:29:13.852 position:5% line:83% align:start
to win this
right at my fingertips.

00:29:13.885 --> 00:29:15.421 position:5% line:83% align:start
The future will
soon be cured

00:29:15.455 --> 00:29:17.189 position:5% line:83% align:start
of the Duel
Monsters plague!

00:29:17.222 --> 00:29:18.424 position:5% line:89% align:start
I send Stardust Dragon

00:29:18.458 --> 00:29:20.526 position:5% line:83% align:start
from my Extra Deck
to the graveyard.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.364 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now, rise up,
Malefic Stardust Dragon!

00:29:31.203 --> 00:29:33.273 position:33% line:89% align:start
My Stardust!

00:29:33.306 --> 00:29:35.642 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Roars]

00:29:35.675 --> 00:29:37.042 position:38% line:89% align:start
Paradox, you snake,

00:29:37.075 --> 00:29:38.578 position:38% line:83% align:start
what have you
done to it?

00:29:38.611 --> 00:29:42.382 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've simply introduced it
to the power of the shadows,

00:29:42.415 --> 00:29:43.650 position:5% line:89% align:start
and there's more to come!

00:29:43.683 --> 00:29:47.553 position:5% line:83% align:start
Next I summon
Malefic Parallel Gear.

00:29:47.587 --> 00:29:49.422 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now, Parallel Gear,

00:29:49.455 --> 00:29:52.057 position:5% line:83% align:start
tune with my Malefic
Stardust Dragon!

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:52.924 position:61% line:89% align:start
What?

00:29:52.958 --> 00:29:54.494 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're not
the only one here

00:29:54.527 --> 00:29:56.763 position:5% line:83% align:start
who can Synchro
Summon, Yusei.

00:29:58.631 --> 00:30:01.233 position:5% line:83% align:start
Behold, as the
shadows drip down

00:30:01.266 --> 00:30:02.602 position:5% line:89% align:start
through the cracks of time,

00:30:02.635 --> 00:30:05.103 position:5% line:83% align:start
and witness how the
darkness pools together

00:30:05.137 --> 00:30:07.873 position:5% line:89% align:start
to create pure evil!

00:30:07.906 --> 00:30:11.477 position:5% line:83% align:start
I Synchro Summon
Malefic Paradox Dragon!

00:30:14.813 --> 00:30:16.449 position:50% line:89% align:start
Not good.

00:30:16.482 --> 00:30:19.485 position:5% line:83% align:start
And next. I'll activate
its special ability!

00:30:19.519 --> 00:30:21.454 position:5% line:83% align:start
You see, since I
Synchro Summoned,

00:30:21.487 --> 00:30:23.523 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm allowed to bring
back a Synchro Monster

00:30:23.556 --> 00:30:25.558 position:5% line:83% align:start
from my graveyard
straight to the field.

00:30:25.591 --> 00:30:28.561 position:5% line:83% align:start
So rise once more,
Stardust Dragon!

00:30:29.995 --> 00:30:31.798 position:38% line:89% align:start
Two dragons again?

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:34.099 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's right, Yusei,
and now Paradox Dragon

00:30:34.132 --> 00:30:36.101 position:5% line:83% align:start
reduces the attack points
of Jaden's monster

00:30:36.134 --> 00:30:39.137 position:5% line:83% align:start
by the attack points of
the monster just revived.

00:30:39.171 --> 00:30:41.674 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, Neos Knight,
power down!

00:30:42.941 --> 00:30:43.909 position:61% line:89% align:start
Neos, no!

00:30:43.942 --> 00:30:45.977 position:27% line:83% align:start
Not good.
If this keeps up,

00:30:46.011 --> 00:30:48.481 position:27% line:83% align:start
Jaden and the others
won't last long at all!

00:30:48.514 --> 00:30:50.717 position:5% line:83% align:start
I would say you three
put up a good fight,

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:52.017 position:5% line:89% align:start
only you didn't.

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:56.456 position:5% line:83% align:start
Malefic Paradox Dragon,
destroy Neos Knight!

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.594 position:38% line:83% align:start
You know what
to do, Jaden.

00:31:01.627 --> 00:31:02.961 position:16% line:89% align:start
You bet I do!

00:31:02.994 --> 00:31:05.498 position:16% line:83% align:start
I play a trap--
Hero Barrier!

00:31:05.531 --> 00:31:07.966 position:19% line:83% align:start
Thanks to this, since I
have an Elemental Hero

00:31:07.999 --> 00:31:11.169 position:16% line:83% align:start
out on my field, I can
negate your attack!

00:31:12.638 --> 00:31:14.374 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well done!
Nice move!

00:31:14.407 --> 00:31:16.308 position:5% line:89% align:start
I wouldn't be so sure!

00:31:16.341 --> 00:31:18.110 position:5% line:83% align:start
I play the trap
Malefic Claw Stream!

00:31:18.143 --> 00:31:20.713 position:5% line:83% align:start
Since a Malefic Synchro
Monster is on my field,

00:31:20.747 --> 00:31:23.649 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm allowed to destroy
one of your monsters!

00:31:27.653 --> 00:31:29.522 position:27% line:89% align:start
Uh! I'll see your trap

00:31:29.555 --> 00:31:31.323 position:21% line:83% align:start
and raise you
with one of my own--

00:31:31.356 --> 00:31:32.891 position:27% line:89% align:start
Elemental Mirage!

00:31:32.924 --> 00:31:35.695 position:21% line:77% align:start
Now, because an
Elemental Hero on my
field was destroyed

00:31:35.728 --> 00:31:37.864 position:27% line:83% align:start
due to an effect,
I can bring him back.

00:31:37.896 --> 00:31:40.198 position:27% line:83% align:start
Return to battle,
Neos Knight!

00:31:42.334 --> 00:31:44.002 position:24% line:89% align:start
A perfect counter!

00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:46.672 position:5% line:83% align:start
Aw, I just figured it
would have been rude of me

00:31:46.706 --> 00:31:48.775 position:5% line:83% align:start
to let you go without a
monster out there with you.

00:31:48.808 --> 00:31:51.309 position:24% line:83% align:start
Thanks. And you can
count on me

00:31:51.343 --> 00:31:54.580 position:24% line:83% align:start
to put Neos Knight
to good use.

00:31:54.614 --> 00:31:56.582 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, Yugi,
but even your best

00:31:56.616 --> 00:31:58.016 position:13% line:89% align:start
won't be good enough here,

00:31:58.049 --> 00:32:00.352 position:16% line:83% align:start
not so long as I have
Stardust Dragon,

00:32:00.385 --> 00:32:03.021 position:16% line:83% align:start
because due to Malefic
Paradox Dragon's ability,

00:32:03.054 --> 00:32:04.690 position:16% line:89% align:start
your monster's attack points

00:32:04.724 --> 00:32:07.660 position:19% line:5% align:start
decrease by Stardust
Dragon's attack points!

00:32:08.661 --> 00:32:10.328 position:27% line:89% align:start
This is all my fault.

00:32:10.362 --> 00:32:11.798 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, it's not, Yusei.

00:32:11.831 --> 00:32:13.633 position:5% line:89% align:start
Stardust Dragon is your card,

00:32:13.666 --> 00:32:15.735 position:5% line:83% align:start
but you're not controlling it,
at least not yet.

00:32:15.768 --> 00:32:17.235 position:38% line:89% align:start
What do you mean?

00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:21.306 position:16% line:83% align:start
Next I'll place two cards
facedown to end my turn.

00:32:21.339 --> 00:32:23.341 position:27% line:89% align:start
Then it's my move now!

00:32:23.375 --> 00:32:26.211 position:27% line:89% align:start
So get ready!

00:32:26.244 --> 00:32:30.048 position:7% line:83% align:start
Very well. Let's see what
you've got, King of Games.

00:32:30.081 --> 00:32:33.351 position:50% line:83% align:start
Yugi, my cards
are your cards!

00:32:33.385 --> 00:32:34.854 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, in that case,

00:32:34.887 --> 00:32:37.155 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll use Reincarnation
of Hope's effect

00:32:37.189 --> 00:32:39.725 position:16% line:83% align:start
to add a monster from
my deck to my hand,

00:32:39.759 --> 00:32:43.028 position:16% line:83% align:start
and the monster I choose
is Dark Magician!

00:32:43.061 --> 00:32:45.163 position:5% line:83% align:start
As though I didn't
see that coming.

00:32:45.197 --> 00:32:48.668 position:5% line:83% align:start
I then activate the spell card
known as Ancient Rules.

00:32:48.701 --> 00:32:50.335 position:16% line:83% align:start
With it, I'm allowed
to summon forth

00:32:50.368 --> 00:32:53.972 position:13% line:83% align:start
a Level 5-or-above monster
directly from my hand.

00:32:54.005 --> 00:32:57.142 position:16% line:83% align:start
So take to the field,
Dark Magician!

00:33:02.682 --> 00:33:04.517 position:5% line:83% align:start
According to
the history books,

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:06.151 position:5% line:89% align:start
that card is Yugi's ace.

00:33:06.184 --> 00:33:07.920 position:38% line:89% align:start
I know. Cool!

00:33:07.954 --> 00:33:10.121 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, as "cool"
as he may be,

00:33:10.155 --> 00:33:13.458 position:5% line:83% align:start
he's still subject to Paradox
Dragon's power-down effect.

00:33:13.493 --> 00:33:15.427 position:38% line:83% align:start
So long as Stardust
Dragon is out,

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:16.796 position:38% line:83% align:start
this will be
tough to win.

00:33:16.829 --> 00:33:20.600 position:27% line:83% align:start
Listen, if Stardust
needs to be destroyed

00:33:20.633 --> 00:33:22.568 position:27% line:83% align:start
for us to have a chance,
then destroy it.

00:33:22.602 --> 00:33:23.736 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yusei!

00:33:23.769 --> 00:33:25.070 position:38% line:89% align:start
It's better that

00:33:25.103 --> 00:33:27.707 position:38% line:83% align:start
than being under the
control of Paradox.

00:33:32.077 --> 00:33:34.279 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, how touching.
Now go already!

00:33:36.749 --> 00:33:38.885 position:27% line:83% align:start
From my hand,
I play the spell

00:33:38.918 --> 00:33:40.887 position:16% line:83% align:start
Bond Between Teacher
and Student!

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.021 position:13% line:83% align:start
Since I have Dark Magician
out on the field,

00:33:43.054 --> 00:33:45.691 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can summon his student,
Dark Magician Girl,

00:33:45.725 --> 00:33:48.159 position:27% line:89% align:start
in defense mode!

00:33:48.193 --> 00:33:50.161 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, my. It looks
like it's going to be

00:33:50.195 --> 00:33:52.665 position:5% line:83% align:start
a real trick for us to
come out on top here.

00:33:52.698 --> 00:33:55.635 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, perhaps, but
remember, as magicians,

00:33:55.668 --> 00:33:57.970 position:27% line:83% align:start
there is no trick that
we can't pull off.

00:33:58.004 --> 00:33:59.104 position:5% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:33:59.137 --> 00:34:02.107 position:19% line:83% align:start
Next, I play the spell
Magic Gate of Miracles.

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:05.377 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now, since I have two
spell-casters out on my field,

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:07.747 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can switch one of your
monsters to defense mode

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:10.783 position:16% line:89% align:start
and switch it to my side.

00:34:10.816 --> 00:34:14.687 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh! I play a trap--
Malefic Force!

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:17.188 position:5% line:83% align:start
And by equipping Malefic
Force to my monster,

00:34:17.222 --> 00:34:19.457 position:5% line:83% align:start
it can't be affected
by your spells,

00:34:19.491 --> 00:34:23.295 position:5% line:83% align:start
which means Paradox Dragon
is no longer up for grabs.

00:34:23.328 --> 00:34:24.564 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yes, that's true,

00:34:24.597 --> 00:34:27.198 position:38% line:83% align:start
but Stardust Dragon
still is.

00:34:30.235 --> 00:34:31.436 position:16% line:89% align:start
No!

00:34:36.341 --> 00:34:40.512 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yusei, Stardust Dragon is
now back where it belongs.

00:34:40.545 --> 00:34:42.113 position:50% line:89% align:start
Thanks, Yugi!

00:34:42.147 --> 00:34:44.349 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ha! You never wanted
Paradox Dragon

00:34:44.382 --> 00:34:45.550 position:27% line:83% align:start
in the first
place, right?

00:34:45.585 --> 00:34:48.186 position:24% line:83% align:start
Mm. Speaking
of Paradox Dragon,

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:50.188 position:24% line:83% align:start
its ability is
no longer in effect,

00:34:50.221 --> 00:34:53.726 position:16% line:5% align:start
which means our monsters'
attack points return to normal.

00:34:58.096 --> 00:35:00.432 position:5% line:83% align:start
Bravo, Yugi.
But so what

00:35:00.465 --> 00:35:03.002 position:5% line:83% align:start
if you restored your
monsters' attack points?

00:35:03.035 --> 00:35:05.437 position:5% line:83% align:start
My Paradox Dragon
still has them beat

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:07.073 position:5% line:5% align:start
with a total of 4,000!

00:35:07.105 --> 00:35:09.541 position:5% line:5% align:start
Face it. You're simply
outmatched.

00:35:09.574 --> 00:35:11.242 position:21% line:89% align:start
I wouldn't say that.

00:35:11.276 --> 00:35:15.313 position:30% line:83% align:start
I play the spell card
Dark Magic Twin Burst!

00:35:15.347 --> 00:35:18.249 position:13% line:5% align:start
With this, Dark Magician's
attack points increase

00:35:18.283 --> 00:35:21.453 position:16% line:83% align:start
by the attack point total
of Dark Magician Girl!

00:35:21.486 --> 00:35:22.955 position:27% line:89% align:start
What?

00:35:22.989 --> 00:35:25.523 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now your monster is the one
who's outmatched, Paradox.

00:35:25.557 --> 00:35:27.026 position:16% line:89% align:start
And not only that,

00:35:27.059 --> 00:35:29.127 position:16% line:83% align:start
it also happens to be
outnumbered, two to one.

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:32.530 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, attack, Dark Magician
and Dark Magician Girl!

00:35:32.564 --> 00:35:33.598 position:61% line:89% align:start
It's time.

00:35:33.633 --> 00:35:35.735 position:5% line:83% align:start
Right--
to kick some butt!

00:35:37.803 --> 00:35:39.805 position:58% line:83% align:start
Here goes.
Now!

00:35:39.839 --> 00:35:42.240 position:19% line:89% align:start
Twin Dark Magic Attack!

00:35:47.647 --> 00:35:49.614 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah!
Sweet!

00:35:49.649 --> 00:35:51.851 position:16% line:83% align:start
They might actually
pull this off!

00:35:53.451 --> 00:35:56.889 position:16% line:83% align:start
Uh! These desperate
moves change nothing!

00:35:56.922 --> 00:35:58.891 position:38% line:83% align:start
I disagree. You had
two monsters,

00:35:58.924 --> 00:36:00.558 position:35% line:83% align:start
and now you
have none.

00:36:00.592 --> 00:36:02.762 position:5% line:89% align:start
And I thank you for that.

00:36:02.795 --> 00:36:04.162 position:5% line:83% align:start
You see, all that
you have done

00:36:04.195 --> 00:36:06.297 position:5% line:83% align:start
is clear the way
for something else--

00:36:06.331 --> 00:36:09.567 position:5% line:83% align:start
something grand,
something almighty!

00:36:09.601 --> 00:36:11.037 position:50% line:89% align:start
Spit it out!

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:14.172 position:5% line:83% align:start
I activate the trap
Malefic Paradigm Shift!

00:36:14.205 --> 00:36:16.676 position:5% line:83% align:start
With Malefic
Paradox Dragon destroyed,

00:36:16.709 --> 00:36:19.177 position:5% line:83% align:start
by sacrificing half
of my Life Points,

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:21.914 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can summon my
most wicked beast,

00:36:21.947 --> 00:36:24.150 position:5% line:89% align:start
Malefic Truth Dragon!

00:36:24.182 --> 00:36:25.517 position:5% line:89% align:start
Aarrrgghh!

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.019 position:61% line:89% align:start
Huh!

00:36:33.358 --> 00:36:35.326 position:38% line:89% align:start
Ha ha ha!

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:38.898 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ha ha ha ha!

00:36:38.931 --> 00:36:41.599 position:38% line:77% align:start
OK, I've seen
some big monsters
in my life,

00:36:41.633 --> 00:36:44.737 position:38% line:77% align:start
but that behemoth
definitely
takes the cake!

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:46.504 position:30% line:83% align:start
And it probably
ate it, too.

00:36:46.538 --> 00:36:48.107 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is your doing, Yugi!

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:51.443 position:5% line:83% align:start
I hope that you're
pleased with yourself.

00:36:51.476 --> 00:36:54.579 position:5% line:83% align:start
I place two cards facedown
and end my turn.

00:36:54.612 --> 00:36:55.781 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh, no!

00:36:55.815 --> 00:36:57.783 position:38% line:89% align:start
The time!

00:36:57.817 --> 00:36:59.952 position:30% line:83% align:start
Pegasus will be
here any minute.

00:36:59.985 --> 00:37:02.188 position:5% line:83% align:start
Mr. Pegasus, sir,
you might want to hold on.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:04.355 position:5% line:89% align:start
Looks like a storm ahead.

00:37:08.393 --> 00:37:12.564 position:38% line:83% align:start
The city--it's
almost...all gone.

00:37:12.597 --> 00:37:13.999 position:27% line:89% align:start
But it's not gone yet,

00:37:14.033 --> 00:37:16.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
and that means Yusei
still has a chance!

00:37:16.568 --> 00:37:19.370 position:50% line:83% align:start
I hope
you're right.

00:37:19.404 --> 00:37:22.707 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's my turn, and I
activate Malefic Selector!

00:37:22.742 --> 00:37:24.275 position:5% line:83% align:start
By removing Malefic
Parallel Gear

00:37:24.309 --> 00:37:26.344 position:5% line:89% align:start
and Malefic Cyber End Dragon,

00:37:26.377 --> 00:37:30.182 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm allowed to add two cards
from my deck to my hand.

00:37:30.216 --> 00:37:32.985 position:5% line:83% align:start
Next, I'll send two monsters
in my deck to the graveyard

00:37:33.018 --> 00:37:35.587 position:5% line:83% align:start
and summon forth their
dark counterparts,

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:37.189 position:5% line:83% align:start
Malefic Blue-Eyes
White Dragon

00:37:37.223 --> 00:37:40.126 position:5% line:83% align:start
and Malefic Red-Eyes
Black Dragon!

00:37:43.294 --> 00:37:45.396 position:38% line:83% align:start
Both Blue-Eyes
and Red-Eyes?

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:49.300 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's right. And now for
a taste of their power!

00:37:49.334 --> 00:37:50.368 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ohh!

00:37:50.401 --> 00:37:53.105 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh! And since Malefic
Truth Dragon is out,

00:37:53.139 --> 00:37:54.506 position:5% line:83% align:start
if one of your
monsters goes down,

00:37:54.539 --> 00:37:57.375 position:5% line:83% align:start
all of your other monsters
are also destroyed.

00:37:57.408 --> 00:37:58.376 position:27% line:89% align:start
What?

00:37:58.409 --> 00:38:01.213 position:41% line:83% align:start
I play a facedown--
the spell De-Fusion!

00:38:01.247 --> 00:38:04.016 position:38% line:83% align:start
Neos Knight,
time to split!

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:07.153 position:50% line:89% align:start
Now, Yusei!

00:38:07.186 --> 00:38:09.855 position:16% line:83% align:start
I play Junk Gardna's
ability!

00:38:09.889 --> 00:38:11.824 position:16% line:83% align:start
It allows me to
switch your monster

00:38:11.857 --> 00:38:13.358 position:16% line:89% align:start
from attacking to defending,

00:38:13.391 --> 00:38:17.163 position:16% line:83% align:start
which means Dark Magician
Girl is safe!

00:38:18.898 --> 00:38:20.833 position:5% line:83% align:start
Jaden, Yusei,
great teamwork!

00:38:20.866 --> 00:38:22.700 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'll show you teamwork!

00:38:22.734 --> 00:38:24.003 position:27% line:89% align:start
Go, Blue-Eyes!

00:38:24.036 --> 00:38:26.704 position:24% line:83% align:start
Pick up where
Red-Eyes left off!

00:38:26.738 --> 00:38:29.407 position:50% line:89% align:start
Aaah!

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.742 position:27% line:89% align:start
Dark Magician!

00:38:30.775 --> 00:38:35.313 position:5% line:83% align:start
Next, Malefic Truth Dragon's
special ability activates,

00:38:35.346 --> 00:38:37.883 position:5% line:83% align:start
which means all
the remaining monsters

00:38:37.917 --> 00:38:41.287 position:5% line:83% align:start
you have on the field
are destroyed.

00:38:42.922 --> 00:38:45.291 position:30% line:83% align:start
Sorry, Paradox.
Don't think so!

00:38:45.323 --> 00:38:47.827 position:16% line:83% align:start
I activate Stardust's
special ability,

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.196 position:13% line:83% align:start
so by releasing my Dragon,
I can negate

00:38:50.229 --> 00:38:53.464 position:13% line:83% align:start
your Dragon's effect and
then destroy it altogether.

00:38:53.498 --> 00:38:54.566 position:27% line:89% align:start
What?

00:38:54.599 --> 00:38:56.601 position:38% line:89% align:start
So say good-bye!

00:38:59.004 --> 00:39:00.906 position:5% line:89% align:start
Not so fast.

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.541 position:5% line:83% align:start
I play Truth Dragon's
other ability!

00:39:03.575 --> 00:39:05.978 position:5% line:83% align:start
By removing Malefic Rainbow
Dragon in my graveyard

00:39:06.011 --> 00:39:08.680 position:5% line:83% align:start
from play,
Truth Dragon is saved,

00:39:08.713 --> 00:39:10.149 position:5% line:83% align:start
and you know
what that means!

00:39:10.182 --> 00:39:12.617 position:5% line:83% align:start
It can carry out
its attack!

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:20.758 position:5% line:83% align:start
And remember, when one
goes, they all go!

00:39:20.792 --> 00:39:22.194 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aah!

00:39:22.228 --> 00:39:23.595 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, and did I mention?

00:39:23.628 --> 00:39:26.165 position:5% line:83% align:start
For every monster destroyed
by this special ability,

00:39:26.198 --> 00:39:28.533 position:5% line:83% align:start
you take 800 points
of damage!

00:39:28.566 --> 00:39:29.935 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ugh!

00:39:29.969 --> 00:39:31.369 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ahh!

00:39:34.106 --> 00:39:35.506 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's right, lie there

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.877 position:5% line:83% align:start
and prepare to
accept your fate!

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:39.477 position:27% line:89% align:start
Can't give up.

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:41.914 position:16% line:83% align:start
We have to keep fighting,
no matter what.

00:39:41.947 --> 00:39:44.950 position:5% line:83% align:start
Keep fighting? You three
can't even defend yourselves!

00:39:44.984 --> 00:39:47.518 position:5% line:83% align:start
Next I play the
spell Malefic Divide.

00:39:47.552 --> 00:39:50.388 position:5% line:83% align:start
With it, I can bring back
one Malefic monster

00:39:50.421 --> 00:39:53.192 position:5% line:83% align:start
from my graveyard until
the end of this turn,

00:39:53.225 --> 00:39:56.561 position:7% line:83% align:start
and the Malefic monster I
choose to bring back is...

00:39:56.594 --> 00:39:58.596 position:5% line:89% align:start
Malefic Stardust Dragon!

00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:59.864 position:47% line:89% align:start
No!

00:39:59.899 --> 00:40:02.134 position:27% line:83% align:start
They only have
500 life points left.

00:40:02.167 --> 00:40:04.203 position:27% line:83% align:start
One attack from Malefic
Stardust Dragon,

00:40:04.236 --> 00:40:05.603 position:27% line:89% align:start
and they're done for!

00:40:05.637 --> 00:40:07.839 position:5% line:83% align:start
I warned you three
not to interfere,

00:40:07.872 --> 00:40:10.009 position:5% line:89% align:start
and now you'll see why!

00:40:10.042 --> 00:40:13.645 position:5% line:83% align:start
Malefic Stardust Dragon,
unleash your fury!

00:40:16.414 --> 00:40:18.716 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now Duel Monsters
shall perish,

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:22.121 position:5% line:83% align:start
and buried deep beneath
its ashes will be you three

00:40:22.154 --> 00:40:25.157 position:5% line:83% align:start
and all the monsters
and cards you hold so dear!

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:27.492 position:27% line:89% align:start
My worst fear...

00:40:30.095 --> 00:40:33.431 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's actually coming true.

00:40:33.464 --> 00:40:35.034 position:27% line:89% align:start
All is lost.

00:40:35.067 --> 00:40:36.634 position:5% line:89% align:start
Aw, lighten up, bro!

00:40:36.668 --> 00:40:38.803 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, things might not
look too good,

00:40:38.836 --> 00:40:42.041 position:7% line:83% align:start
but you forget, we have a
secret weapon on our side.

00:40:42.074 --> 00:40:44.076 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's right.
Because the three of us

00:40:44.109 --> 00:40:46.278 position:16% line:83% align:start
believe in Duel Monsters
with all of our hearts,

00:40:46.312 --> 00:40:47.779 position:19% line:89% align:start
while Paradox does not,

00:40:47.812 --> 00:40:50.581 position:16% line:83% align:start
and when you believe,
you always have a chance.

00:40:50.615 --> 00:40:52.217 position:5% line:83% align:start
You said it!
And that's why

00:40:52.251 --> 00:40:54.353 position:5% line:83% align:start
we still have a chance,
right here and now!

00:40:54.386 --> 00:40:56.989 position:7% line:83% align:start
Maybe it'd be better if I
just show you what I mean.

00:40:57.022 --> 00:41:00.059 position:5% line:83% align:start
I play a spell--Flute of
Summoning Kuriboh!

00:41:00.092 --> 00:41:02.061 position:5% line:83% align:start
This lets us add Kuriboh
or Winged Kuriboh

00:41:02.094 --> 00:41:03.661 position:5% line:89% align:start
to our hand from the deck.

00:41:03.695 --> 00:41:04.696 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're up!

00:41:04.729 --> 00:41:06.231 position:30% line:89% align:start
Right! Kuriboh!

00:41:07.598 --> 00:41:09.567 position:30% line:83% align:start
I activate your
special ability,

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.936 position:16% line:83% align:start
an ability that lets
Kuriboh take the hit

00:41:11.971 --> 00:41:14.173 position:16% line:83% align:start
from Stardust Dragon
instead of us!

00:41:23.648 --> 00:41:25.217 position:38% line:89% align:start
No!

00:41:27.552 --> 00:41:29.421 position:27% line:83% align:start
All right!
There's still hope!

00:41:29.455 --> 00:41:31.390 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yugi, I will
make you pay dearly

00:41:31.423 --> 00:41:32.992 position:5% line:89% align:start
for that little stunt!

00:41:33.025 --> 00:41:35.060 position:38% line:83% align:start
I'm not so sure
you will, Paradox,

00:41:35.094 --> 00:41:36.494 position:38% line:83% align:start
because at the
end of his turn,

00:41:36.527 --> 00:41:38.496 position:38% line:83% align:start
Malefic Divide's
effect will be gone,

00:41:38.529 --> 00:41:41.266 position:38% line:77% align:start
which means
Malefic Stardust
Dragon will be gone!

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:42.867 position:27% line:83% align:start
But not the real
Stardust Dragon,

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.803 position:19% line:83% align:start
because due to its ability,
it now returns to the field.

00:41:54.179 --> 00:41:57.849 position:5% line:83% align:start
Stardust Dragon.
Glad you're back.

00:41:57.882 --> 00:42:00.052 position:50% line:89% align:start
[Roaring]

00:42:00.085 --> 00:42:01.387 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yusei.

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:02.553 position:61% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:42:02.587 --> 00:42:05.457 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's up to you now.
It's your move.

00:42:05.491 --> 00:42:08.593 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just know that we're
behind you--all of us are.

00:42:35.586 --> 00:42:37.688 position:27% line:83% align:start
All right.
Let's do this!

00:42:37.722 --> 00:42:40.125 position:16% line:83% align:start
For Duel Monsters
and all my friends,

00:42:40.159 --> 00:42:43.295 position:21% line:83% align:start
and the people
of New Domino City!

00:42:43.328 --> 00:42:45.130 position:50% line:89% align:start
Yeah! No doubt!

00:42:45.164 --> 00:42:46.998 position:50% line:83% align:start
Now let him
have it!

00:42:47.031 --> 00:42:48.833 position:16% line:89% align:start
It'll be my pleasure.

00:42:48.866 --> 00:42:51.103 position:27% line:89% align:start
I play a trap!

00:42:51.136 --> 00:42:52.804 position:5% line:83% align:start
Stardust Mirage!
Oh, no!

00:42:52.837 --> 00:42:56.141 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, yes, and since Stardust
Dragon's on the field,

00:42:56.175 --> 00:42:58.143 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can bring back
all our monsters

00:42:58.177 --> 00:43:01.313 position:24% line:83% align:start
that were destroyed
during this turn!

00:43:04.516 --> 00:43:07.286 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I just got rid
of all of them!

00:43:07.319 --> 00:43:08.686 position:38% line:89% align:start
Now for our draw--

00:43:08.719 --> 00:43:12.590 position:38% line:83% align:start
and for your
downfall, Paradox!

00:43:12.623 --> 00:43:15.561 position:16% line:83% align:start
I hate to interrupt good
trash-talking, but here.

00:43:15.593 --> 00:43:18.363 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is worth it--
the trap Neos Spiral Force.

00:43:18.397 --> 00:43:19.897 position:27% line:83% align:start
This doubles the
attack points

00:43:19.931 --> 00:43:21.300 position:27% line:83% align:start
of one monster
on the field.

00:43:21.333 --> 00:43:24.436 position:38% line:83% align:start
I also play a trap--
Dark Spiral Force!

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:26.472 position:38% line:83% align:start
And due to this
force, I can select

00:43:26.505 --> 00:43:28.440 position:38% line:83% align:start
a monster out
on our field and

00:43:28.474 --> 00:43:31.477 position:41% line:5% align:start
double its attack
points once again!

00:43:34.179 --> 00:43:36.315 position:5% line:89% align:start
10,000 attack points? No!

00:43:36.348 --> 00:43:37.748 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's right!

00:43:42.421 --> 00:43:45.491 position:27% line:89% align:start
Dark Magician, attack!

00:43:45.524 --> 00:43:47.091 position:38% line:89% align:start
Aaah!

00:43:47.126 --> 00:43:50.695 position:16% line:89% align:start
Elemental Hero Neos, attack!

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:53.232 position:24% line:89% align:start
Let this be proof--

00:43:53.265 --> 00:43:55.200 position:27% line:83% align:start
the light will always
overcome the dark!

00:43:55.234 --> 00:43:59.271 position:21% line:83% align:start
Go, Stardust Dragon!
Attack!

00:44:10.482 --> 00:44:13.651 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now go, Dark Cosmic Wave!

00:44:13.684 --> 00:44:15.420 position:38% line:89% align:start
No!

00:44:21.226 --> 00:44:24.563 position:38% line:89% align:start
No!

00:44:30.602 --> 00:44:32.069 position:5% line:89% align:start
Good news, Mr. Pegasus.

00:44:32.103 --> 00:44:34.373 position:5% line:83% align:start
The storm clouds
are clearing.

00:44:43.681 --> 00:44:45.816 position:16% line:83% align:start
It certainly must be
a dream come true

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:47.885 position:27% line:83% align:start
for you all to be
so close to me.

00:44:47.919 --> 00:44:48.920 position:61% line:89% align:start
Awesome!

00:44:48.953 --> 00:44:50.021 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wow, thanks!

00:44:50.054 --> 00:44:51.223 position:50% line:89% align:start
It's your move.

00:44:51.256 --> 00:44:52.990 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let's see what you got.

00:44:53.024 --> 00:44:54.158 position:50% line:89% align:start
OK. Say cheese!

00:44:54.193 --> 00:44:58.263 position:41% line:83% align:start
So looks like our
work is done here.

00:44:58.297 --> 00:44:59.498 position:30% line:89% align:start
Looks that way.

00:44:59.531 --> 00:45:02.401 position:38% line:83% align:start
Well, guess this
is good-bye, then.

00:45:02.434 --> 00:45:03.701 position:38% line:83% align:start
Great meeting
you both.

00:45:03.734 --> 00:45:05.671 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hey, think we'll all
meet again sometime?

00:45:05.703 --> 00:45:08.105 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah. But let's hope
that when we do,

00:45:08.139 --> 00:45:10.174 position:7% line:83% align:start
the whole world
of Duel Monsters

00:45:10.209 --> 00:45:11.476 position:5% line:89% align:start
isn't on the line again.

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:13.345 position:38% line:89% align:start
You said it, Yusei.

00:45:13.378 --> 00:45:15.247 position:38% line:83% align:start
Maybe we could
duel each other.

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.181 position:38% line:83% align:start
Whatever happens,
I know the bond

00:45:17.216 --> 00:45:18.517 position:38% line:83% align:start
we formed here
today is one that's

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:20.985 position:38% line:83% align:start
going to stand
the test of time.

00:45:21.018 --> 00:45:22.753 position:27% line:89% align:start
All of time.

00:45:22.787 --> 00:45:24.389 position:5% line:89% align:start
Absolutely.

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.941 position:16% line:83% align:start
YUSEI, VOICEOVER: At long
last, I finally feel like

00:45:43.975 --> 00:45:47.144 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can let go of the past
and focus on the future.

00:45:47.178 --> 00:45:50.449 position:16% line:83% align:start
Paradox may have painted a
bleak picture for the world,

00:45:50.482 --> 00:45:53.184 position:16% line:83% align:start
but I know the future
isn't set in stone.

00:45:53.217 --> 00:45:55.420 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's what we make it.

00:45:55.454 --> 00:45:59.558 position:16% line:83% align:start
And together, we're going
to make it bright...

00:45:59.591 --> 00:46:01.993 position:16% line:83% align:start
because the true magic
of Duel Monsters

00:46:02.026 --> 00:46:05.196 position:13% line:83% align:start
isn't just in the cards,
it's in all the friendships

00:46:05.229 --> 00:46:08.032 position:35% line:83% align:start
I've forged
thanks to the game.
