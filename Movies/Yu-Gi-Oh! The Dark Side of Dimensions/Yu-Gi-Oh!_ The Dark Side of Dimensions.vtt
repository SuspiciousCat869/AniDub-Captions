Well...

For the last time...
you're behind schedule.

Speed up your progress

Yes, sir!

Faster, everyone!
Work faster!

I wonder...is this thing
even really down here?

Please, we're working
as fast as we can...

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:49.869 position:27% line:89% align:start
But, sir... huh?

00:02:58.844 --> 00:03:02.715 position:19% line:83% align:start
Big bro, it's Mokuba.
Don't worry, we'll find it.

Bye, Grandpa, gotta go.

Wait one second, Yugi.

00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:13.425 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's up?

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.527 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well, I was wondering...

00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:17.261 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wondering what?
I'm kinda late.

00:03:17.295 --> 00:03:20.833 position:21% line:83% align:start
I was wondering about Tea,
I haven't seen her lately.

00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:22.433 position:16% line:89% align:start
Uhh...

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:24.703 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't you two always walk
to school together?

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:27.305 position:5% line:83% align:start
Only little kids do that,
Grandpa.

00:03:27.338 --> 00:03:29.374 position:5% line:89% align:start

I guess there's just

00:04:33.503 --> 00:04:34.671 position:44% line:83% align:start
something
about that accent.

You got in?

00:04:58.327 --> 00:05:01.798 position:19% line:83% align:start
That study abroad program's
lucky to have you.

00:05:01.832 --> 00:05:03.667 position:50% line:83% align:start
But, aren't you
a little scared?

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.669 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, to be
a professional dancer,

00:05:05.702 --> 00:05:07.971 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can't be afraid to bite off
more than I can chew!

00:05:08.004 --> 00:05:11.273 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you're as graceful as you
are with those chopsticks...

00:05:11.307 --> 00:05:12.676 position:27% line:89% align:start
you'll make it for sure!

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:15.544 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm so proud that you're
following your dreams, Tea.

00:05:15.578 --> 00:05:17.013 position:24% line:83% align:start

At least someone gets to.

00:05:17.047 --> 00:05:19.816 position:33% line:83% align:start
My Dad says that after
I graduate...

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.753 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna have to go work
in his factory.

00:05:23.786 --> 00:05:24.520 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:05:24.553 --> 00:05:26.957 position:38% line:83% align:start
Chin up, bud,
it could be worse...

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.860 position:5% line:83% align:start
I knew a guy whose job was bein'
a professional wrestling dummy!

00:05:30.893 --> 00:05:33.963 position:5% line:83% align:start
Okay, fine,
that was me one summer.

00:05:33.996 --> 00:05:35.364 position:5% line:89% align:start
But I did learn some moves!

00:05:35.397 --> 00:05:36.499 position:5% line:89% align:start
I call this one...

00:05:36.532 --> 00:05:38.334 position:5% line:89% align:start
the sleepwich!

00:05:38.367 --> 00:05:40.469 position:58% line:89% align:start
Uncle, uncle!

00:05:40.503 --> 00:05:42.037 position:41% line:89% align:start
And you, Joey?

00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:43.939 position:30% line:83% align:start
You still plan
to become a pro-duelist

00:05:43.973 --> 00:05:45.306 position:35% line:89% align:start
after school is over?

00:05:45.341 --> 00:05:46.909 position:5% line:89% align:start
You better believe it,

00:05:46.942 --> 00:05:49.612 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll be the champion
of the world in no time!

00:05:49.645 --> 00:05:51.747 position:5% line:83% align:start
There's no one out there
who can stop me!

00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:54.717 position:16% line:83% align:start
Except our math teacher, who
confiscated your Duel Disk

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.052 position:24% line:83% align:start
for polishing it in class
last week.

00:05:57.086 --> 00:06:00.856 position:10% line:83% align:start
Though it took guts to do it
during our final exam.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.323 position:5% line:89% align:start
Your turn, Yugi...

00:06:02.357 --> 00:06:03.458 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's time to share.

00:06:03.491 --> 00:06:05.627 position:5% line:83% align:start
Tell the guys
what your game plan is.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.696 position:21% line:89% align:start
Uh...sure, why not?

00:06:10.532 --> 00:06:12.902 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm going to keep helping
my Grandpa at the game shop

00:06:12.935 --> 00:06:15.737 position:10% line:83% align:start
but I'm gonna start creating
my own games, too.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.541 position:10% line:83% align:start
I know it may sound a little
cheesy, but maybe one day...

00:06:19.574 --> 00:06:22.377 position:24% line:83% align:start
we'll all be able
to play one together...

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.380 position:16% line:89% align:start
That would be lovely, Yugi.

00:06:25.413 --> 00:06:26.381 position:5% line:89% align:start
For sure!

00:06:26.414 --> 00:06:27.682 position:5% line:89% align:start
In fact, let's promise,

00:06:27.715 --> 00:06:29.617 position:5% line:83% align:start
when Yuge's game
makes it big...

00:06:29.651 --> 00:06:32.020 position:5% line:83% align:start
We all meet up and play it,
whadaya say, guys?

00:06:32.053 --> 00:06:33.354 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm in!

00:06:33.388 --> 00:06:35.123 position:61% line:89% align:start
Yes, me too!

00:06:35.156 --> 00:06:36.424 position:38% line:83% align:start
When you say
"big..."

00:06:36.457 --> 00:06:38.760 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't worry...
you'll do it.

00:06:38.793 --> 00:06:40.962 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just remember, your friends
believe in you.

00:06:40.995 --> 00:06:43.965 position:41% line:83% align:start
Thanks.
And... I believe...

00:06:43.998 --> 00:06:45.733 position:52% line:89% align:start
in you all too.

00:06:46.835 --> 00:06:49.403 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, It is pretty good, but...

00:06:49.436 --> 00:06:51.673 position:21% line:83% align:start
my best trap card--
huh?

00:06:51.706 --> 00:06:52.874 position:64% line:89% align:start
What gives?

00:06:52.907 --> 00:06:56.343 position:19% line:83% align:start
That kid over there...
in the corner...

00:06:58.545 --> 00:07:00.380 position:35% line:89% align:start
Who is he?

00:07:00.414 --> 00:07:01.515 position:41% line:89% align:start
You don't remember?

00:07:01.548 --> 00:07:03.952 position:13% line:89% align:start
I do... but then again...

00:07:03.985 --> 00:07:05.987 position:7% line:83% align:start
I know he's been in our class
all year,

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.656 position:7% line:83% align:start
but I can't remember his name.
Am I crazy?

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.092 position:33% line:89% align:start
Nah, you're just dumb.

00:07:11.125 --> 00:07:12.426 position:41% line:89% align:start
His name's... uh...

00:07:12.459 --> 00:07:13.927 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, what is it?

00:07:13.961 --> 00:07:16.029 position:58% line:83% align:start
Oh, I know...
It's, uh...

00:07:16.063 --> 00:07:16.997 position:61% line:89% align:start
Uh, it's....

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:20.567 position:72% line:77% align:start
Oh!
I
remember!

00:07:20.601 --> 00:07:23.537 position:50% line:83% align:start
Aigami!
That's his name.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.538 position:16% line:89% align:start
Aigami?

00:07:24.571 --> 00:07:27.407 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah, Aigami.

00:07:27.441 --> 00:07:28.675 position:33% line:89% align:start
How did I forget that?

00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:30.978 position:27% line:89% align:start
Right, Aigami...

00:07:31.011 --> 00:07:34.447 position:21% line:83% align:start
Take your seats, everyone.
Sit down!

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.448 position:27% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:07:35.481 --> 00:07:37.651 position:78% line:89% align:start
Sorry.

Well, Joey, hope you're happy,
you got your Duel Disk back.

00:07:47.127 --> 00:07:48.527 position:5% line:83% align:start
(Joey)
Sure did!

00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:50.563 position:5% line:83% align:start
Though it could use
another polish!

00:07:50.596 --> 00:07:52.565 position:5% line:89% align:start
Still... all good!

00:07:52.598 --> 00:07:53.532 position:41% line:89% align:start
Great.

00:07:55.102 --> 00:07:58.205 position:27% line:77% align:start

Hey, whatcha got
your deck out for, Yuge?

00:07:58.238 --> 00:08:00.140 position:38% line:83% align:start
You wanna take me on
in a duel?

00:08:00.173 --> 00:08:02.109 position:41% line:89% align:start
No...

00:08:02.142 --> 00:08:03.876 position:21% line:89% align:start
just thinking back.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:04.977 position:5% line:89% align:start
About what?

00:08:05.011 --> 00:08:07.214 position:30% line:89% align:start
About... him.

00:08:07.247 --> 00:08:10.950 position:5% line:89% align:start
You mean Atem?

00:08:10.983 --> 00:08:11.851 position:61% line:89% align:start
Uh... sorry.

00:08:11.884 --> 00:08:14.120 position:21% line:83% align:start
Just forget
that I even brought it up.

00:08:14.153 --> 00:08:16.188 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yuge, it's okay...

00:08:16.222 --> 00:08:18.124 position:5% line:89% align:start
you guys shared a connection.

00:08:18.157 --> 00:08:21.761 position:5% line:83% align:start
It totally makes sense
ya miss him sometimes.

00:08:25.097 --> 00:08:28.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
Not just sometimes.
All the time.

00:08:30.069 --> 00:08:33.471 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's just that things ended
so suddenly between us...

00:08:33.505 --> 00:08:36.742 position:10% line:89% align:start
You used to be a part of me,

00:08:36.776 --> 00:08:38.177 position:21% line:89% align:start
but then you weren't

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:41.013 position:7% line:83% align:start
and we had to face each other
in a duel.

00:08:41.047 --> 00:08:45.884 position:10% line:83% align:start
A duel to determine whether
I was ready to stand on my own.

00:08:45.918 --> 00:08:47.852 position:16% line:89% align:start
And when I defeated you,

00:08:47.886 --> 00:08:52.023 position:10% line:83% align:start
you left us, you left me...
forever.

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:55.760 position:10% line:89% align:start
I know it was for the best,

00:08:55.794 --> 00:08:57.963 position:19% line:83% align:start
but I wish I just had
one more chance...

00:08:57.996 --> 00:09:00.665 position:27% line:83% align:start
to let him know
what he meant to me.

00:09:06.905 --> 00:09:10.175 position:27% line:83% align:start
But destiny had
different plans for us.

00:09:15.547 --> 00:09:17.649 position:5% line:77% align:start
(Joey)
Uh-oh, trouble!
Huh?

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:19.250 position:47% line:89% align:start
What is it, Joey?

00:09:21.219 --> 00:09:22.921 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:09:24.222 --> 00:09:25.390 position:30% line:89% align:start
Smile bright, Aigami...

00:09:25.423 --> 00:09:29.828 position:10% line:83% align:start
After all, you're the star
of my how-to film on bullying!

00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:31.963 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please, please, stop!

00:09:31.997 --> 00:09:35.666 position:24% line:83% align:start
'Fraid not--
only I get to yell "Cut!"

00:09:35.699 --> 00:09:36.734 position:41% line:83% align:start
(Joey)
Oh, yeah?!

00:09:36.767 --> 00:09:39.636 position:38% line:89% align:start
Aah...!

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.272 position:44% line:83% align:start
Oof!
That was on purpose!

00:09:41.306 --> 00:09:42.806 position:5% line:89% align:start
Joey Wheeler!

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.974 position:24% line:89% align:start
What do you want?!

00:09:44.008 --> 00:09:46.810 position:47% line:83% align:start
A fight if you
don't let him go!

00:09:46.844 --> 00:09:48.946 position:58% line:89% align:start
Aah... you...

00:09:48.979 --> 00:09:51.648 position:30% line:83% align:start
meet at the old factory
tonight or else.

00:09:51.682 --> 00:09:53.284 position:64% line:89% align:start
Come alone.

00:09:53.318 --> 00:09:55.285 position:5% line:89% align:start
(chuckling)

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.721 position:61% line:83% align:start
Later,
loser.

00:09:59.857 --> 00:10:01.091 position:52% line:89% align:start
Whoa, Aigami!

00:10:01.125 --> 00:10:03.627 position:55% line:89% align:start
You all right?

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.863 position:5% line:83% align:start
I am now...
thanks to you, that is.

00:10:05.896 --> 00:10:06.930 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thanks for
stepping in there.

00:10:06.964 --> 00:10:08.232 position:41% line:83% align:start
(Yugi)
Everything okay?!

00:10:11.135 --> 00:10:13.704 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're Joey, right?
And Tea... ?

00:10:13.737 --> 00:10:15.239 position:27% line:89% align:start
And you...

00:10:15.272 --> 00:10:16.740 position:16% line:89% align:start
you're Yugi Muto...

00:10:16.774 --> 00:10:17.875 position:16% line:83% align:start
(chuckling)
Isn't that right?

00:10:17.908 --> 00:10:19.810 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah...but...

00:10:19.843 --> 00:10:21.577 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't we already
know each other?

00:10:21.611 --> 00:10:23.646 position:55% line:83% align:start
Yes...
but of course.

00:10:23.679 --> 00:10:25.349 position:58% line:89% align:start
Thanks again.

00:10:25.382 --> 00:10:27.017 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hold up!

00:10:27.051 --> 00:10:29.153 position:5% line:83% align:start
If those mouth-breathing bullies
give you any more trouble...

00:10:29.186 --> 00:10:31.288 position:33% line:83% align:start
We can help.
Just say the word!

00:10:32.822 --> 00:10:36.126 position:33% line:83% align:start
Thank you...
but I'll be fine.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.062 position:41% line:83% align:start
(Joey)
Well, he ain't much for words.

00:10:39.095 --> 00:10:43.733 position:13% line:83% align:start
So how do we know and not
know him at the same time?

00:10:43.766 --> 00:10:46.869 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah...
wish I had a good answer.

00:10:46.903 --> 00:10:48.805 position:5% line:83% align:start
(Tea)
Same here.

00:10:50.373 --> 00:10:51.908 position:33% line:89% align:start
No worries.

00:10:51.941 --> 00:10:54.143 position:16% line:83% align:start
At least there's always
one thing that's certain...

00:10:54.177 --> 00:10:55.978 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm starving!

00:10:56.012 --> 00:10:58.714 position:19% line:83% align:start
Whadaya say we go get
some dirty water dogs?

00:10:58.748 --> 00:11:00.183 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yugi's treat.
Or Tea's.

00:11:00.216 --> 00:11:02.085 position:35% line:83% align:start
Or I guess
we could call up Tristan.

00:11:02.118 --> 00:11:03.286 position:47% line:89% align:start
♪♪

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.201 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uhh.

00:11:19.235 --> 00:11:22.771 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't believe it!
The dunce actually showed!

00:11:22.804 --> 00:11:25.341 position:35% line:89% align:start
Bad move.

00:11:25.374 --> 00:11:26.908 position:33% line:89% align:start
Now then...

00:11:26.942 --> 00:11:30.145 position:16% line:83% align:start
whadaya say we get back
to makin' our film?

00:11:30.178 --> 00:11:31.713 position:5% line:89% align:start
(chuckles)

00:11:31.746 --> 00:11:33.748 position:5% line:83% align:start
I believe
we were at the part...

00:11:33.782 --> 00:11:36.852 position:5% line:83% align:start
where you start crying
like a baby.

00:11:36.885 --> 00:11:40.322 position:16% line:83% align:start
If he don't cry, Scud,
we got ways to make him.

00:11:40.355 --> 00:11:43.291 position:16% line:83% align:start
And it don't involve...
an onion.

00:11:43.325 --> 00:11:45.961 position:35% line:89% align:start
Huh? Huh?

00:11:45.994 --> 00:11:48.930 position:24% line:89% align:start
(bullies laughing)

00:11:48.964 --> 00:11:52.267 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Aigami laughing)

00:11:54.102 --> 00:11:56.004 position:41% line:83% align:start
(Scud)
Why are <i>you</i> laughing?

00:11:56.037 --> 00:11:59.207 position:27% line:83% align:start
We're serious about
the onion! I, I mean it!

00:11:59.241 --> 00:12:03.345 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm certain you do.
And that is why you must vanish.

00:12:03.378 --> 00:12:04.446 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:04.479 --> 00:12:07.249 position:35% line:83% align:start
Do you...
h-have a ...

00:12:07.282 --> 00:12:08.350 position:24% line:89% align:start
wand or something?

00:12:08.383 --> 00:12:12.053 position:5% line:83% align:start
What I have is the power
to change your pathetic world

00:12:12.087 --> 00:12:13.954 position:5% line:89% align:start
into someplace grand...

00:12:13.988 --> 00:12:17.091 position:5% line:83% align:start
someplace you don't deserve
to exist.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.297 position:35% line:83% align:start
(gasping)
Who are you?

00:12:30.137 --> 00:12:31.972 position:55% line:83% align:start
Even worse,
who are they?!

00:12:32.006 --> 00:12:35.042 position:5% line:77% align:start
(Aigami)
Who they are will be
made clear soon enough.

00:12:35.075 --> 00:12:37.478 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I'm afraid
you won't be around long enough

00:12:37.511 --> 00:12:39.680 position:5% line:89% align:start
to learn this truth.

00:12:41.015 --> 00:12:42.883 position:21% line:89% align:start
Look... I'm sorry...

00:12:45.452 --> 00:12:49.756 position:30% line:89% align:start
Please, just let me go!

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.992 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, yes, you'll
be going all right.

00:12:52.026 --> 00:12:55.462 position:5% line:83% align:start
To another dimension
more fitting for you.

00:13:04.438 --> 00:13:06.739 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:13:06.773 --> 00:13:09.343 position:16% line:89% align:start
What's happening to me?!

00:13:12.879 --> 00:13:14.147 position:24% line:89% align:start
(groaning louder)

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.816 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh... you don't look so good.

00:13:16.849 --> 00:13:20.019 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:13:20.053 --> 00:13:21.821 position:33% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

00:13:21.854 --> 00:13:24.023 position:58% line:83% align:start
Oh, no, Scud!
He's history!

00:13:24.057 --> 00:13:26.159 position:24% line:89% align:start
(bullies gasping)

00:13:26.192 --> 00:13:28.828 position:38% line:83% align:start
(Aigami)
No... history is remembered.

00:13:28.861 --> 00:13:30.730 position:21% line:89% align:start
(bullies screaming)

00:14:12.337 --> 00:14:16.208 position:41% line:83% align:start
I've been waiting
for you... Pharaoh!

00:14:16.241 --> 00:14:19.478 position:33% line:83% align:start
Today we settle things
once and for all.

00:14:19.511 --> 00:14:24.483 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hmph. I take that to mean
you want to duel... Kaiba.

00:14:24.516 --> 00:14:26.418 position:35% line:83% align:start
I certainly didn't go
to all the trouble

00:14:26.451 --> 00:14:28.820 position:38% line:83% align:start
of bringing you here
to ask you to dance.

00:14:28.854 --> 00:14:30.122 position:50% line:89% align:start
Yes, we'll duel.

00:14:30.155 --> 00:14:32.457 position:33% line:83% align:start
And we'll do so with
my new, bleeding-edge,

00:14:32.491 --> 00:14:34.359 position:16% line:83% align:start
beyond state-of-the-art
Duel Disk!

00:14:34.393 --> 00:14:37.362 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've been waiting for this
a long time, Pharaoh!

00:14:37.396 --> 00:14:40.265 position:10% line:89% align:start
Now...prepare to do battle!

00:14:43.435 --> 00:14:45.237 position:38% line:89% align:start
And prepare to lose!

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:48.540 position:7% line:83% align:start
Oh, I see you're just as cocky
as ever, Kaiba,

00:14:48.573 --> 00:14:50.609 position:27% line:89% align:start
but so be it...

00:14:50.642 --> 00:14:53.312 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's time to duel!

00:14:55.547 --> 00:14:56.814 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's begin!
Let's begin!

00:14:58.916 --> 00:15:02.153 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'll go first... I draw!

00:15:06.558 --> 00:15:07.825 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.096 position:16% line:83% align:start
I warned you to prepare
for battle, Pharaoh...

00:15:12.129 --> 00:15:15.499 position:16% line:83% align:start
but there's no preparing
for this!

00:15:15.533 --> 00:15:18.035 position:27% line:89% align:start
I Fusion Summon!

00:15:23.574 --> 00:15:29.413 position:38% line:83% align:start
Behold,
Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon!

00:15:29.447 --> 00:15:30.614 position:38% line:89% align:start
(roars)

00:15:32.916 --> 00:15:34.185 position:21% line:89% align:start
Your turn, Pharaoh.

00:15:36.052 --> 00:15:37.488 position:33% line:89% align:start
Fine, Kaiba.

00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:39.055 position:38% line:89% align:start
I draw!

00:15:39.089 --> 00:15:42.192 position:5% line:83% align:start
First I activate the spell card
Dark Magic Veil!

00:15:43.394 --> 00:15:48.164 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then by using my life points...
I can summon...

00:15:48.198 --> 00:15:51.569 position:21% line:83% align:start
My most ardent ally,
Dark Magician!

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.373 position:27% line:83% align:start
Next, I'll play
Thousand Knives

00:15:56.406 --> 00:16:00.210 position:7% line:83% align:start
And give your Ultimate Dragon
an ultimate shredding!

00:16:00.243 --> 00:16:03.980 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't think so!
I play my trap!

00:16:04.013 --> 00:16:08.318 position:5% line:83% align:start
Dark Sacrifice gives your Knives
a new monster to mince!

00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:13.289 position:27% line:89% align:start
Not bad, Kaiba.

00:16:14.524 --> 00:16:15.425 position:27% line:89% align:start
Got that right.

00:16:15.458 --> 00:16:18.161 position:27% line:83% align:start
Since you failed
to destroy Neo Blue-Eyes,

00:16:18.194 --> 00:16:19.529 position:24% line:89% align:start
it can now attack!

00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:22.898 position:13% line:83% align:start
And Dark Magician will be
its first victim!

00:16:26.503 --> 00:16:30.005 position:21% line:83% align:start
You have no monsters
to protect you, Pharaoh.

00:16:30.038 --> 00:16:31.474 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're through!

00:16:31.508 --> 00:16:32.509 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wrong!
Huh?

00:16:38.113 --> 00:16:40.550 position:5% line:83% align:start
I activated the trap
Time Chain.

00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:43.686 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not only does my Dark Magician
survive your attack,

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.622 position:5% line:89% align:start
But both he and your Dragon

00:16:45.655 --> 00:16:48.490 position:5% line:83% align:start
are locked out of
this duel for two turns.

00:16:48.524 --> 00:16:51.728 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're just prolonging
the inevitable,

00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:53.629 position:27% line:89% align:start
I will beat you!

00:16:53.663 --> 00:16:55.097 position:5% line:89% align:start
(chuckles)

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.499 position:5% line:83% align:start
You've been saying that
for years, Kaiba.

00:16:57.533 --> 00:17:00.102 position:5% line:83% align:start
I summon Celtic Guard
of Noble Arms

00:17:00.135 --> 00:17:01.537 position:5% line:89% align:start
and Celtic Guardian!

00:17:03.338 --> 00:17:06.642 position:35% line:77% align:start
(thinking)
Pharaoh... you don't know
how long I've been waiting

00:17:06.675 --> 00:17:07.676 position:30% line:89% align:start
to battle you.

00:17:07.709 --> 00:17:10.312 position:13% line:83% align:start
The things I've had to do
to make it possible.

00:17:10.345 --> 00:17:13.248 position:33% line:83% align:start
But for me,
there never was a choice.

00:17:13.282 --> 00:17:17.118 position:7% line:83% align:start
After all, my scars of defeat
run deep, Pharaoh.

00:17:17.152 --> 00:17:19.254 position:7% line:89% align:start
Scars you inflicted upon me...

00:17:19.288 --> 00:17:20.756 position:21% line:83% align:start
And though they may
never go away,

00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:24.258 position:7% line:83% align:start
something can be done to make
them easier to live with.

00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:26.728 position:16% line:83% align:start
Inflict upon your enemy
an even greater wound,

00:17:26.762 --> 00:17:30.666 position:5% line:83% align:start
a defeat so resounding it leaves
their soul completely crushed!

00:17:36.638 --> 00:17:40.274 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're the closest I've ever
had to a worthy adversary.

00:17:40.308 --> 00:17:42.610 position:19% line:89% align:start
But you aren't worthy.

00:17:42.644 --> 00:17:44.378 position:19% line:83% align:start
And I'm finally going
to prove it!

00:17:44.412 --> 00:17:46.414 position:5% line:89% align:start
Two turns have passed, Kaiba,

00:17:46.447 --> 00:17:50.685 position:5% line:83% align:start
so Dark Magician is released
from the ties that bind him!

00:17:50.718 --> 00:17:53.588 position:5% line:83% align:start
But there's more.
I play Magical Dimension!

00:17:53.621 --> 00:17:57.592 position:5% line:83% align:start
Celtic Guard of Noble Arms,
lend me your strength,

00:17:57.625 --> 00:18:00.027 position:5% line:83% align:start
and I'll use that strength
for...

00:18:00.061 --> 00:18:02.196 position:5% line:89% align:start
Dark Magician Girl!

00:18:05.166 --> 00:18:06.467 position:35% line:89% align:start
(giggles)

00:18:06.501 --> 00:18:10.304 position:5% line:83% align:start
And with her arrival
comes your monster's departure!

00:18:12.707 --> 00:18:15.242 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now go!

00:18:15.275 --> 00:18:16.777 position:5% line:89% align:start
Double Dark Magic Attack!

00:18:16.811 --> 00:18:18.346 position:38% line:89% align:start
Aah...!

00:18:18.379 --> 00:18:20.046 position:52% line:89% align:start
Don't you dare!

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.682 position:16% line:89% align:start
Unless you want to fall prey

00:18:21.716 --> 00:18:25.786 position:41% line:83% align:start
to my Neo Blue-Eyes
Ultimate Dragon!

00:18:28.388 --> 00:18:29.356 position:58% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:18:29.389 --> 00:18:31.057 position:35% line:89% align:start
Call off your attack!

00:18:31.091 --> 00:18:34.661 position:35% line:83% align:start
Heh. You could never
stand up to my power.

00:18:34.695 --> 00:18:37.297 position:44% line:89% align:start
Not then, not now.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:39.232 position:33% line:89% align:start
And with this power...

00:18:39.266 --> 00:18:41.501 position:47% line:89% align:start
I will crush you!

00:18:44.337 --> 00:18:46.406 position:5% line:89% align:start
I beg to differ.

00:18:46.439 --> 00:18:47.240 position:72% line:89% align:start
Hah.

00:18:47.274 --> 00:18:50.243 position:5% line:89% align:start
Go! Dimension Reflector!

00:18:50.277 --> 00:18:52.479 position:5% line:89% align:start
By banishing my two magicians,

00:18:52.512 --> 00:18:55.181 position:5% line:83% align:start
this trap transforms
into a Mirror Monster

00:18:55.215 --> 00:18:56.416 position:5% line:89% align:start
with the same attack points

00:18:56.449 --> 00:18:59.084 position:5% line:83% align:start
as your Neo Blue-Eyes
Ultimate Dragon!

00:18:59.118 --> 00:19:02.355 position:5% line:83% align:start
But here's the best part,
you then take damage...

00:19:02.389 --> 00:19:05.224 position:5% line:83% align:start
equal to those same
attack points!

00:19:05.257 --> 00:19:07.226 position:55% line:89% align:start
You set me up.

00:19:07.259 --> 00:19:08.728 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's over, Kaiba!

00:19:20.272 --> 00:19:21.641 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:21.675 --> 00:19:25.477 position:21% line:83% align:start
But I knew you'd set me up
so I had this ready...

00:19:25.511 --> 00:19:28.380 position:21% line:83% align:start
the Trap Enhanced Counter.
Too bad, Pharaoh...

00:19:28.414 --> 00:19:30.149 position:21% line:89% align:start
The damage you sent my way

00:19:30.182 --> 00:19:32.852 position:33% line:83% align:start
increases my monster's
attack points instead.

00:19:32.886 --> 00:19:34.753 position:5% line:89% align:start
That means...

00:19:34.787 --> 00:19:37.890 position:33% line:83% align:start
Yes...it means that
after all this time...

00:19:37.923 --> 00:19:39.491 position:66% line:89% align:start
(chuckles)

00:19:39.525 --> 00:19:42.528 position:41% line:83% align:start
I will finally have
my revenge!

00:19:42.561 --> 00:19:45.764 position:38% line:83% align:start
Attack!
Hyper Neutron Blast!

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:13.859 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well done,
Mr. Kaiba!

00:20:13.892 --> 00:20:16.661 position:24% line:83% align:start
A success on every level.
You should be proud.

00:20:16.694 --> 00:20:19.597 position:5% line:83% align:start
I am.
The Duel Link Solidvision System

00:20:19.631 --> 00:20:21.432 position:5% line:89% align:start
is a technological marvel.

00:20:21.466 --> 00:20:24.870 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's far superior to any design
that's come before it.

00:20:27.438 --> 00:20:29.507 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's sleeker, more precise.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:30.875 position:13% line:89% align:start
It gives me real-time data

00:20:30.908 --> 00:20:33.511 position:27% line:83% align:start
from Kaibacorp's
Crystal Cloud Network,

00:20:33.544 --> 00:20:36.314 position:16% line:83% align:start
and when used in tandem
with my new Duel Disk,

00:20:36.347 --> 00:20:37.815 position:7% line:89% align:start
it gives life to all the cards

00:20:37.849 --> 00:20:39.851 position:30% line:83% align:start
I've collected
through the years.

00:20:39.884 --> 00:20:42.854 position:19% line:83% align:start
It can even give life
to my very thoughts!

00:20:42.887 --> 00:20:46.457 position:7% line:83% align:start
After all, since it's directly
connected with my brain,

00:20:46.491 --> 00:20:49.192 position:24% line:83% align:start
anything I imagine
can become a reality.

00:20:49.226 --> 00:20:52.563 position:13% line:83% align:start
Just as you all witnessed
with the Pharaoh.

00:20:52.597 --> 00:20:55.432 position:27% line:83% align:start
He proved to be
an exact replica.

00:20:55.465 --> 00:20:57.635 position:5% line:83% align:start
And you defeated him
soundly, sir.

00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:59.604 position:16% line:83% align:start
I concur,
it was no contest.

00:20:59.637 --> 00:21:01.706 position:38% line:83% align:start
(Kaiba)
Quiet, you sniveling sycophants!

00:21:01.739 --> 00:21:02.707 position:35% line:89% align:start
(all gasp)

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.442 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's true, I went
to a great deal of trouble

00:21:05.475 --> 00:21:08.211 position:7% line:83% align:start
recreating the Pharaoh's deck,
strategies,

00:21:08.245 --> 00:21:09.881 position:5% line:89% align:start
even his perfectly coiffed hair.

00:21:09.914 --> 00:21:12.516 position:24% line:83% align:start
In fact, that part
is what took the longest.

00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:14.785 position:33% line:89% align:start
But still...

00:21:14.818 --> 00:21:18.221 position:10% line:83% align:start
it wasn't the real Pharaoh,
so I didn't really beat him.

00:21:18.255 --> 00:21:23.560 position:16% line:83% align:start
And until I do, my scars
of defeat will continue to burn!

00:21:23.593 --> 00:21:25.962 position:33% line:83% align:start
Fire whoever
designed that bottle.

00:21:25.996 --> 00:21:28.465 position:24% line:83% align:start
Kaibacorp products
shouldn't bend that easily.

00:21:28.498 --> 00:21:29.700 position:5% line:83% align:start
(all)
Yes, understood!

00:21:29.733 --> 00:21:31.501 position:35% line:83% align:start
(thinking)
I will face you, Pharaoh.

00:21:31.535 --> 00:21:33.270 position:16% line:89% align:start
You can't hide forever.

00:21:33.303 --> 00:21:34.638 position:35% line:77% align:start

Hmm?

Hey, there.

00:21:52.488 --> 00:21:54.423 position:5% line:83% align:start
Super cute,
like movie star cute.

Tristan,
isn't that Joey's Duel Disk?

00:22:00.997 --> 00:22:04.366 position:21% line:83% align:start
You got serious guts
taking it apart like that!

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.634 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nah, it's cool, Duke--

00:22:05.668 --> 00:22:08.471 position:5% line:83% align:start
it's been acting up
so he asked me to fix it.

Hey, what are you
looking at there, Yugi?

00:22:10.406 --> 00:22:12.441 position:5% line:89% align:start
What? Oh...

00:22:12.475 --> 00:22:13.676 position:5% line:89% align:start
This article...

00:22:14.777 --> 00:22:17.279 position:41% line:83% align:start
Wait...
it's those bullies.

00:22:17.313 --> 00:22:20.015 position:10% line:83% align:start
Says here that they all just
disappeared without a trace.

00:22:20.049 --> 00:22:21.951 position:50% line:83% align:start
And they're
still missing?

00:22:21.984 --> 00:22:24.053 position:41% line:83% align:start
Mm-hmm. Gets worse,
the article says

00:22:24.086 --> 00:22:27.356 position:13% line:83% align:start
there's been a whole bunch of
these cases all around here!

00:22:27.389 --> 00:22:29.058 position:5% line:89% align:start
Not just here, the whole world.

00:22:29.091 --> 00:22:32.828 position:5% line:83% align:start

50 people vanishing all at once.

00:22:32.862 --> 00:22:34.563 position:72% line:83% align:start
What?
No way.

00:22:34.597 --> 00:22:36.331 position:13% line:89% align:start
Anyway, enjoy your lunch!

00:22:38.934 --> 00:22:41.503 position:5% line:83% align:start

That someone could be
watching us right now.

00:22:44.006 --> 00:22:47.810 position:5% line:83% align:start
True... but I think they're all
pretty harmless, Bakura...

00:22:47.843 --> 00:22:48.811 position:41% line:89% align:start
Look.

00:22:48.844 --> 00:22:50.512 position:44% line:89% align:start

with my Duel Disk, Tristan?!

00:23:40.494 --> 00:23:41.461 position:30% line:89% align:start
You broke it!

00:23:41.495 --> 00:23:42.629 position:38% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:23:42.663 --> 00:23:46.134 position:16% line:83% align:start
And... 'cause you did...
you owe me!

00:23:46.167 --> 00:23:48.802 position:5% line:83% align:start
Owe you?
You asked me to fix it!

00:23:48.836 --> 00:23:51.638 position:35% line:83% align:start
And now I'm askin'...
for a new one!

00:23:51.672 --> 00:23:52.706 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:23:52.739 --> 00:23:55.375 position:27% line:89% align:start
Guys, chill out already.

00:23:55.409 --> 00:23:56.777 position:78% line:83% align:start
(gaps)
Hey!

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.045 position:47% line:89% align:start
Beat it, ya mutt!

00:23:58.078 --> 00:24:00.881 position:5% line:77% align:start
(Tristan)
You need to be put
back on a leash!

00:24:03.483 --> 00:24:04.651 position:44% line:89% align:start
No!

00:24:04.685 --> 00:24:05.886 position:33% line:89% align:start
My balloon!

00:24:05.919 --> 00:24:07.087 position:52% line:89% align:start
Way to go.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.589 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey!
Wheeler!

00:24:08.622 --> 00:24:12.593 position:27% line:83% align:start
I've told you...
no clowning around here!

00:24:12.626 --> 00:24:14.761 position:19% line:89% align:start
This job isn't a joke!

00:24:14.795 --> 00:24:17.130 position:24% line:83% align:start
Selling ice cream
is not a laughing matter!

00:24:17.164 --> 00:24:19.900 position:13% line:83% align:start
You've turned my business
into a circus!

00:24:25.638 --> 00:24:27.774 position:38% line:77% align:start
(Aigami)
When the Pharaoh
leaves this world,

00:24:27.808 --> 00:24:30.077 position:19% line:83% align:start
the power of the Plana
will be granted.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:34.780 position:13% line:83% align:start
But should he ever return,
this power will be recanted.

00:24:34.814 --> 00:24:38.584 position:10% line:83% align:start
Our dear master Shin told us
this prophecy,

00:24:38.618 --> 00:24:40.753 position:7% line:89% align:start
a prophecy that has come true.

00:24:40.786 --> 00:24:43.556 position:13% line:83% align:start
When Yugi sent the Pharaoh
to the great beyond,

00:24:43.589 --> 00:24:44.991 position:19% line:89% align:start
we attained the Plana,

00:24:45.024 --> 00:24:50.062 position:21% line:83% align:start
the magic to remake
the very fiber of reality.

00:24:50.096 --> 00:24:53.699 position:10% line:83% align:start
And I shall wield this power
to avenge you...

00:24:53.733 --> 00:24:55.034 position:33% line:89% align:start
Master Shin.

00:24:55.067 --> 00:24:56.435 position:5% line:83% align:start
(children)
No, Diva.

00:24:56.469 --> 00:24:58.838 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do not let your emotions
control you.

00:24:58.871 --> 00:25:03.509 position:5% line:83% align:start
But what happened to Master Shin
cannot be forgiven.

00:25:03.542 --> 00:25:05.645 position:5% line:89% align:start
You must forgive.

00:25:05.678 --> 00:25:08.814 position:5% line:83% align:start
You must not forgive.
(echoing...)

00:25:12.184 --> 00:25:16.454 position:30% line:77% align:start
(Sera)
Diva... you must resist
your dark urges.

00:25:16.488 --> 00:25:19.091 position:19% line:89% align:start
Good cannot grow from evil.

00:25:19.125 --> 00:25:21.994 position:27% line:83% align:start
That is what Master Shin
taught you.

00:25:24.964 --> 00:25:28.067 position:35% line:83% align:start
Or have you forgotten
his teachings?

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.602 position:16% line:89% align:start
Not for a single moment.

00:25:30.635 --> 00:25:33.471 position:5% line:89% align:start
Even now his words still echo...

00:25:33.505 --> 00:25:37.575 position:7% line:83% align:start
But so do the memories of what
happened that fateful night

00:25:37.609 --> 00:25:39.778 position:10% line:89% align:start
and the days that led to it.

00:25:41.646 --> 00:25:46.117 position:21% line:83% align:start
I cannot, I will not
forget them.

00:25:46.151 --> 00:25:48.887 position:30% line:83% align:start
They remind me
that I must make him pay

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.189 position:5% line:89% align:start
for what he did to Master Shin.

00:25:51.222 --> 00:25:52.891 position:10% line:89% align:start
And since he's in Domino...

00:25:52.924 --> 00:25:54.659 position:16% line:89% align:start
that's where I must go!

00:25:57.929 --> 00:26:00.665 position:66% line:83% align:start
No, diva!
Come back!

00:26:14.678 --> 00:26:18.183 position:58% line:83% align:start
(Manny)
Diva... Diva!

00:26:18.216 --> 00:26:20.651 position:38% line:83% align:start
It's not too late
to change your mind.

00:26:20.684 --> 00:26:25.522 position:10% line:83% align:start
My friend, I doubt Master Shin
would desire revenge.

00:26:25.556 --> 00:26:27.992 position:10% line:89% align:start
This is not revenge, Manny.

00:26:28.025 --> 00:26:31.595 position:21% line:83% align:start
This is simply doing
what is right and just.

00:26:31.628 --> 00:26:34.198 position:5% line:83% align:start
Come now, Diva,
you know that's not so.

00:26:34.231 --> 00:26:37.301 position:13% line:89% align:start
I must do what I must do.

00:26:37.335 --> 00:26:39.036 position:47% line:89% align:start
But at what cost?

00:26:39.069 --> 00:26:40.070 position:33% line:89% align:start
At any cost.

00:26:42.573 --> 00:26:44.108 position:24% line:89% align:start
Understand, Manny.

00:26:44.141 --> 00:26:47.945 position:19% line:83% align:start
There is nothing wrong
with eradicating evil.

00:26:47.978 --> 00:26:50.681 position:16% line:83% align:start
And no one is more evil
than him!

00:26:50.714 --> 00:26:53.050 position:64% line:83% align:start
(gasps)
But Diva...

00:26:55.719 --> 00:26:59.056 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's been found!
Just as we feared!

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:15.239 position:19% line:89% align:start
Mr. Kaiba has arrived!

00:27:24.614 --> 00:27:25.782 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey there, bro!

00:27:25.815 --> 00:27:27.550 position:33% line:83% align:start
You grace us
with your presence, sir!

00:27:29.152 --> 00:27:31.854 position:21% line:83% align:start
Have all the pieces
been accounted for?

00:27:31.888 --> 00:27:33.923 position:5% line:89% align:start
Each and every one, sir!

00:27:41.397 --> 00:27:42.932 position:27% line:89% align:start
So this is it...

00:27:42.965 --> 00:27:45.268 position:13% line:83% align:start
the spot where the Pharaoh
and little Yugi Muto

00:27:45.301 --> 00:27:47.036 position:19% line:89% align:start
had their final duel.

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:49.772 position:24% line:83% align:start
Where the Pharaoh
left this world.

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:53.876 position:5% line:83% align:start
As you requested sir,
the pieces were placed

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:56.145 position:5% line:83% align:start
in our most sophisticated
security apparatus

00:27:56.179 --> 00:27:59.015 position:5% line:83% align:start
so that no one would disturb
them before your arrival.

00:27:59.048 --> 00:28:02.717 position:5% line:83% align:start
Motion sensor technology,
reinforced puncture proof glass,

00:28:02.751 --> 00:28:05.154 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can assure you,
no expense was spared.

00:28:05.188 --> 00:28:07.123 position:16% line:83% align:start
Load it into the chopper
at once.

00:28:07.156 --> 00:28:08.924 position:7% line:89% align:start
I plan to reassemble it today.

00:28:08.957 --> 00:28:10.159 position:5% line:89% align:start
Right away sir!

00:28:10.193 --> 00:28:12.295 position:30% line:89% align:start
Reassemble it?

00:28:12.328 --> 00:28:14.830 position:30% line:83% align:start
You do realize
it took Yugi eight years

00:28:14.863 --> 00:28:16.198 position:16% line:83% align:start
to complete the puzzle,
don't you?

00:28:16.231 --> 00:28:19.167 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's because Yugi's
a simple-minded child.

00:28:19.201 --> 00:28:20.168 position:69% line:89% align:start
Let's go!

00:28:20.202 --> 00:28:21.236 position:33% line:89% align:start
Sorry, sir.

00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:23.004 position:10% line:83% align:start
The system's on a time delay
for extra security.

00:28:23.038 --> 00:28:24.339 position:24% line:89% align:start
It'll be a moment.

00:28:24.372 --> 00:28:28.710 position:5% line:83% align:start
In that case, why don't
you introduce yourself?

00:28:28.743 --> 00:28:31.012 position:5% line:83% align:start
We have a visitor
with us, Mokuba.

00:28:31.046 --> 00:28:33.815 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's right.
I know you're here.

00:28:33.849 --> 00:28:36.184 position:5% line:89% align:start
So show yourself, Aigami.

00:28:36.218 --> 00:28:40.222 position:5% line:83% align:start
Or would you prefer your
other nomenclature, Diva.

00:28:40.255 --> 00:28:43.325 position:33% line:89% align:start
(chuckling)

00:28:43.358 --> 00:28:45.726 position:19% line:89% align:start
You know my real name.

00:28:45.759 --> 00:28:48.662 position:10% line:89% align:start
Most impressive, Seto Kaiba.

00:28:48.696 --> 00:28:50.132 position:16% line:89% align:start
But I'd expect no less!

00:28:51.832 --> 00:28:53.667 position:21% line:89% align:start
So nice to meet you.

00:28:53.701 --> 00:28:55.137 position:5% line:89% align:start
My network of security tech

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:58.038 position:5% line:83% align:start
says that you were in the town
of Domino minutes ago.

00:28:58.072 --> 00:28:59.673 position:5% line:89% align:start
How is it you're suddenly here?

00:28:59.707 --> 00:29:04.279 position:33% line:83% align:start
With a power
you can't possibly comprehend.

00:29:04.312 --> 00:29:06.113 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's a kind of magic...

00:29:06.147 --> 00:29:09.083 position:10% line:83% align:start
the same magic these others
have used to arrive here.

00:29:09.116 --> 00:29:12.420 position:19% line:83% align:start
And unlike your tech,
magic has no limits.

00:29:12.454 --> 00:29:14.321 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's this guy's deal?

00:29:14.355 --> 00:29:17.091 position:16% line:83% align:start
I assume you're here to take
the Millennium Puzzle.

00:29:17.124 --> 00:29:19.960 position:33% line:83% align:start
Make that
 <i>my</i> Millennium Puzzle.

00:29:19.994 --> 00:29:21.896 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, it's yours, is it?

00:29:21.929 --> 00:29:25.199 position:35% line:83% align:start
(chuckles)
We'll see about that.

00:29:25.232 --> 00:29:28.369 position:38% line:83% align:start
No, we won't.
No false moves, kid.

00:29:29.837 --> 00:29:32.940 position:41% line:83% align:start
Whoa!
You got me!

00:29:32.973 --> 00:29:34.841 position:30% line:89% align:start
Or... do you?

00:29:34.875 --> 00:29:36.076 position:64% line:89% align:start
Stop, now!

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:38.112 position:10% line:89% align:start
But there is no stopping us,

00:29:38.145 --> 00:29:40.347 position:19% line:83% align:start
for we wield the power
of the Plana.

00:29:40.381 --> 00:29:46.052 position:16% line:83% align:start
And this is what happens
when you meddle with us!

00:29:46.086 --> 00:29:48.389 position:38% line:89% align:start
I gotta be dreaming!

00:29:48.422 --> 00:29:50.357 position:35% line:89% align:start
This isn't happening!

00:29:50.391 --> 00:29:53.294 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:29:54.794 --> 00:29:55.995 position:38% line:89% align:start
Help me!

00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:58.131 position:5% line:83% align:start
Stop!
What are you doing?!

00:29:58.164 --> 00:30:00.900 position:30% line:83% align:start
Nothing much.
I'm just sending him away...

00:30:00.934 --> 00:30:04.971 position:30% line:83% align:start
to a dimension
that he may not enjoy.

00:30:05.004 --> 00:30:07.073 position:38% line:83% align:start
For you
see, we are the Plana...

00:30:07.106 --> 00:30:08.875 position:24% line:83% align:start
the next evolution
of enlightenment,

00:30:08.908 --> 00:30:14.314 position:7% line:83% align:start
a collective of souls who will
rid this world of all evil.

00:30:14.347 --> 00:30:17.417 position:19% line:83% align:start
They are wise to run,
but at the same time,

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:21.387 position:7% line:83% align:start
foolhardy because there is no
escape from what's coming.

00:30:21.421 --> 00:30:25.225 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not for them and most certainly
not for you, Seto Kaiba.

00:30:25.258 --> 00:30:29.529 position:13% line:83% align:start
Because let's be truthful,
you're the worst of them all.

00:30:29.562 --> 00:30:30.963 position:7% line:89% align:start
You have gone to great lengths

00:30:30.997 --> 00:30:32.898 position:16% line:83% align:start
to create your very own
collective.

00:30:32.931 --> 00:30:35.033 position:7% line:89% align:start
One where everyone serves you,

00:30:35.068 --> 00:30:38.271 position:7% line:83% align:start
whether they be a consumer...
or an employee.

00:30:38.304 --> 00:30:40.273 position:5% line:89% align:start
You want to control everything.

00:30:40.306 --> 00:30:42.975 position:30% line:83% align:start
But no matter,
it's all coming to an end.

00:30:43.008 --> 00:30:45.811 position:21% line:83% align:start
And as you just saw,
we've already begun...

00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:48.548 position:21% line:83% align:start
banishing evil ones
to an alternate dimension...

00:30:48.581 --> 00:30:51.417 position:16% line:83% align:start
where they will receive
just what they deserve.

00:30:51.451 --> 00:30:54.786 position:5% line:83% align:start
Those reports about people
vanishing all over the world...

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.088 position:5% line:89% align:start
they must be 'cause of him!

00:30:56.121 --> 00:30:59.024 position:16% line:89% align:start
Ah, so you know my work.

00:30:59.057 --> 00:31:01.393 position:24% line:83% align:start
And we won't rest
until every evil soul

00:31:01.426 --> 00:31:05.197 position:19% line:83% align:start
in this world suffers
that same fate.

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:07.866 position:7% line:83% align:start
But don't take my word for it,
Kaiba...

00:31:07.899 --> 00:31:12.437 position:10% line:83% align:start
See for yourself, after all,
you're next up on our list!

00:31:14.906 --> 00:31:17.875 position:24% line:89% align:start
Farewell, Kaiba...

00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:20.178 position:24% line:89% align:start
and good riddance!

00:31:21.613 --> 00:31:24.316 position:5% line:89% align:start
Seto, no!

00:31:24.349 --> 00:31:25.883 position:33% line:89% align:start
I think not!

00:31:25.916 --> 00:31:28.387 position:5% line:89% align:start
No one orders around Seto Kaiba!

00:31:30.455 --> 00:31:32.190 position:38% line:89% align:start
No one!!

00:31:34.892 --> 00:31:38.062 position:41% line:83% align:start
What?
What's happening?

00:31:38.095 --> 00:31:41.032 position:33% line:89% align:start
He survived?

00:31:41.065 --> 00:31:44.001 position:35% line:83% align:start
Diva...
how is this possible?

00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:46.003 position:21% line:89% align:start
The Plana is all-powerful.

00:31:46.037 --> 00:31:48.072 position:33% line:83% align:start
He should not have
been able to repel it.

00:31:50.474 --> 00:31:53.944 position:7% line:83% align:start
You said tech has its limits.
Wrong.

00:31:53.978 --> 00:31:57.948 position:5% line:83% align:start
There are no limits when you're
as brilliant as Seto Kaiba!

00:31:57.982 --> 00:32:00.384 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:32:00.418 --> 00:32:02.386 position:38% line:89% align:start
Clever... however...

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:06.856 position:24% line:83% align:start
I cannot permit you
to resurrect the Pharaoh.

00:32:06.891 --> 00:32:08.892 position:16% line:83% align:start
Please.
You can't stop me.

00:32:08.926 --> 00:32:10.528 position:10% line:89% align:start
Perhaps not like the others,

00:32:10.561 --> 00:32:14.432 position:10% line:83% align:start
but I have alternate methods
at my disposal...

00:32:14.465 --> 00:32:17.067 position:24% line:89% align:start
such as my cards.

00:32:17.101 --> 00:32:18.169 position:66% line:89% align:start
As do I...

00:32:18.202 --> 00:32:20.036 position:38% line:83% align:start
so cease your
brainless stammering

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:21.572 position:24% line:89% align:start
and let's get on with it!

00:32:21.605 --> 00:32:23.173 position:5% line:89% align:start
(Aigami chuckling)

00:32:23.207 --> 00:32:25.208 position:5% line:83% align:start
I was hoping
you'd feel that way.

00:32:25.241 --> 00:32:27.010 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, let us duel...

00:32:27.043 --> 00:32:29.312 position:5% line:89% align:start
but this duel, Seto Kaiba...

00:32:31.314 --> 00:32:34.884 position:5% line:83% align:start
...will be unlike any
you've ever had before!

00:32:34.918 --> 00:32:36.886 position:38% line:83% align:start
(gasps)
What's going on?!

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.022 position:38% line:89% align:start
Mr. Mokuba, look up!

00:32:39.055 --> 00:32:40.256 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's that?

00:32:41.592 --> 00:32:44.194 position:5% line:89% align:start
Be careful, Diva.

00:32:44.227 --> 00:32:47.263 position:5% line:83% align:start
Kaiba is a formidable
adversary....

00:32:50.166 --> 00:32:51.234 position:5% line:83% align:start
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:32:51.267 --> 00:32:54.604 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'll do the honors...

00:32:54.637 --> 00:32:56.139 position:69% line:89% align:start
I draw!!!

00:32:57.607 --> 00:32:59.042 position:58% line:89% align:start
What's this?!

00:32:59.075 --> 00:33:01.144 position:41% line:83% align:start
I can summon my
high-level monsters

00:33:01.177 --> 00:33:02.911 position:27% line:89% align:start
without paying any cost?

00:33:02.945 --> 00:33:04.247 position:5% line:77% align:start
(Aigami)
Correct.
In this duel,

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.250 position:5% line:83% align:start
you won't be summoning monsters
in the normal fashion.

00:33:07.283 --> 00:33:09.219 position:5% line:89% align:start
You'll be Dimension Summoning.

00:33:09.252 --> 00:33:12.322 position:5% line:83% align:start
Furthermore, you are allowed
to choose how many attack

00:33:12.355 --> 00:33:15.057 position:5% line:83% align:start
and defense points
each of your monsters have.

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:17.192 position:38% line:83% align:start
And how do I do that
exactly?

00:33:17.226 --> 00:33:19.462 position:5% line:83% align:start
By infusing
your spirit energy.

00:33:19.496 --> 00:33:22.665 position:5% line:83% align:start
But you can't exceed your
monster's original point total.

00:33:22.699 --> 00:33:23.999 position:66% line:89% align:start
Fine then.

00:33:24.032 --> 00:33:25.401 position:38% line:83% align:start
These new rules will
make crushing you

00:33:25.434 --> 00:33:28.103 position:38% line:83% align:start
simpler than before!
Here goes!

00:33:28.137 --> 00:33:30.339 position:41% line:89% align:start
I Dimension Summon!

00:33:30.372 --> 00:33:32.074 position:72% line:89% align:start
Rise up!

00:33:32.107 --> 00:33:35.210 position:69% line:89% align:start
(yelling)

00:33:38.247 --> 00:33:40.716 position:52% line:89% align:start
Krystal Dragon!

00:33:40.749 --> 00:33:42.117 position:35% line:89% align:start
(roaring)

00:33:45.154 --> 00:33:47.956 position:38% line:83% align:start
Then...
I'll end with these!

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:50.959 position:5% line:83% align:start
I see you've spirited
your monster's attack points

00:33:50.993 --> 00:33:52.461 position:5% line:89% align:start
to the max, but...

00:33:52.494 --> 00:33:54.263 position:5% line:83% align:start
there's something
you should know.

00:33:54.296 --> 00:33:55.697 position:5% line:89% align:start
In a dimension duel...

00:33:55.731 --> 00:33:59.701 position:5% line:83% align:start
if your monster's destroyed,
you don't take battle damage...

00:33:59.735 --> 00:34:04.406 position:5% line:83% align:start
you take damage equal...
to its attack points!

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:08.209 position:5% line:83% align:start
Speaking of monsters, it's time
to bring out one of mine.

00:34:08.242 --> 00:34:11.245 position:5% line:83% align:start
And as you can see,
it's a looker!

00:34:11.279 --> 00:34:15.651 position:5% line:83% align:start
Feast your eyes on,
Vijam the Cubic Seed!

00:34:18.754 --> 00:34:21.522 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're keeping
its attack points at zero?

00:34:21.556 --> 00:34:25.193 position:5% line:83% align:start
Correct, Seto Kaiba...
I end my turn.

00:34:25.226 --> 00:34:27.261 position:52% line:89% align:start
Not surprising.

00:34:27.295 --> 00:34:30.164 position:30% line:83% align:start
You cower from power...
while I...

00:34:30.198 --> 00:34:31.499 position:64% line:89% align:start
embrace it!

00:34:31.532 --> 00:34:34.569 position:50% line:83% align:start
I summon another
Krystal Dragon!

00:34:38.172 --> 00:34:41.542 position:38% line:89% align:start
Now... attack Vijam!

00:34:47.715 --> 00:34:49.350 position:55% line:89% align:start
Where'd it go?

00:34:49.383 --> 00:34:51.252 position:5% line:83% align:start
To another dimension
that's well out

00:34:51.285 --> 00:34:54.020 position:5% line:83% align:start
of your Krystal Dragon's
range of attack.

00:34:54.054 --> 00:34:55.256 position:5% line:89% align:start
And there's more...

00:34:55.289 --> 00:34:56.557 position:75% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:34:56.591 --> 00:35:00.126 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is what happens
when a monster attacks Vijam.

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:04.665 position:5% line:83% align:start
It loses its special abilities
and its ability to attack.

00:35:04.699 --> 00:35:09.169 position:13% line:83% align:start
So you've neutralized it.
Guess it's a good thing...

00:35:09.202 --> 00:35:11.505 position:10% line:89% align:start
I have a spare ready to go!

00:35:14.174 --> 00:35:16.576 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not for long...
not with my trap card!

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:19.412 position:5% line:83% align:start
Cubic Ascension
summons another Vijam

00:35:19.446 --> 00:35:21.481 position:5% line:89% align:start
that you're forced to attack!

00:35:22.582 --> 00:35:25.685 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now both your dragons
are out of commission.

00:35:25.719 --> 00:35:28.054 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:35:28.088 --> 00:35:29.689 position:58% line:89% align:start
You're wrong!

00:35:29.723 --> 00:35:31.224 position:69% line:89% align:start
Behold...

00:35:31.258 --> 00:35:33.059 position:58% line:89% align:start
I activate...

00:35:33.093 --> 00:35:34.594 position:58% line:89% align:start
Dragon's Orb!

00:35:34.628 --> 00:35:38.063 position:5% line:83% align:start
This trap card not only restores
Krystal Dragon's abilities,

00:35:38.098 --> 00:35:39.432 position:24% line:89% align:start
but I also get to draw...

00:35:39.466 --> 00:35:42.302 position:47% line:83% align:start
two Blue-Eyes
out from my deck!

00:35:42.335 --> 00:35:43.603 position:64% line:89% align:start
You know...

00:35:43.637 --> 00:35:46.439 position:41% line:83% align:start
why should I stop
at two Blue-Eyes...

00:35:46.473 --> 00:35:50.610 position:19% line:83% align:start
when I can Dimension Summon
a third one!

00:35:50.644 --> 00:35:54.280 position:35% line:83% align:start
Blue-Eyes Alternative
White Dragon!

00:35:59.653 --> 00:36:02.622 position:44% line:83% align:start
Unleash your rage,
Blue Eyes...

00:36:02.656 --> 00:36:04.791 position:52% line:89% align:start
Blue Lightning!

00:36:14.266 --> 00:36:17.703 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not bad,
but unfortunately...

00:36:17.736 --> 00:36:22.207 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just before your attack landed,
I played the trap Cubic Rebirth.

00:36:22.241 --> 00:36:24.510 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not only does it
negate your attack...

00:36:24.543 --> 00:36:28.347 position:5% line:83% align:start
it also allows me
to summon yet another Vijam.

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.316 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, but fortunately for you,

00:36:30.349 --> 00:36:33.117 position:5% line:83% align:start
you get to summon
the two Blue-Eyes in your hand.

00:36:33.151 --> 00:36:35.654 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, wait.
Did I say "fortunately"?

00:36:35.688 --> 00:36:36.655 position:5% line:89% align:start
I lied.

00:36:36.689 --> 00:36:39.625 position:5% line:83% align:start
They suffer the same fate
as your other dragons!

00:36:45.163 --> 00:36:46.799 position:69% line:89% align:start
Fine.

00:36:46.832 --> 00:36:48.399 position:5% line:83% align:start
(chuckling)
Upset?

00:36:48.433 --> 00:36:51.536 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then I've got bad news...
you really won't like this!

00:36:54.472 --> 00:36:56.407 position:5% line:89% align:start
I Dimension Summon!

00:36:56.441 --> 00:36:58.711 position:5% line:83% align:start
Say goodbye for now
to one of my Vijam's...

00:36:58.744 --> 00:37:03.548 position:5% line:83% align:start
and hello to Dark Garnex
the Cubic Beast!

00:37:03.581 --> 00:37:05.583 position:38% line:89% align:start
(growls)

00:37:09.354 --> 00:37:11.623 position:41% line:83% align:start
Whoa!
His monster transformed?

00:37:11.656 --> 00:37:13.324 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:37:13.358 --> 00:37:15.426 position:5% line:83% align:start
Dark Garnex absorbed
Vijam's essence

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:18.763 position:5% line:89% align:start
to gain 1000 attack points.

00:37:18.796 --> 00:37:21.733 position:5% line:83% align:start
Attack points it'll use
to great effect!

00:37:25.436 --> 00:37:27.372 position:33% line:89% align:start
(straining)

00:37:27.405 --> 00:37:29.540 position:5% line:83% align:start
With your dragon gone,
my Cubic Beast

00:37:29.574 --> 00:37:32.610 position:5% line:83% align:start
transforms back into Vijam,
but...

00:37:32.644 --> 00:37:35.847 position:5% line:83% align:start
the fun isn't over.
Know why?

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:39.651 position:5% line:83% align:start
Because I'm combining
and transforming more Vijams!

00:37:39.684 --> 00:37:43.453 position:5% line:89% align:start
Forge into a new Cubic Beast!

00:37:43.487 --> 00:37:46.724 position:5% line:83% align:start
A Cubic Beast
that is twice as powerful!

00:37:46.758 --> 00:37:48.692 position:5% line:89% align:start
Blade Garoodia!

00:37:53.865 --> 00:37:56.868 position:5% line:83% align:start
It destroys two more
of your monsters.

00:38:07.878 --> 00:38:10.647 position:5% line:83% align:start
As your dragons fall
one after another,

00:38:10.681 --> 00:38:13.950 position:5% line:83% align:start
so do any hopes
of you winning this duel!

00:38:13.984 --> 00:38:16.953 position:5% line:83% align:start
Face it.
You are finished!

00:38:16.987 --> 00:38:22.324 position:5% line:83% align:start
I use all three of my Vijams
to Dimension Summon once more!

00:38:22.358 --> 00:38:26.630 position:5% line:83% align:start
Emerge, Buster Gundil
the Cubic Behemoth!

00:38:29.666 --> 00:38:33.235 position:5% line:83% align:start
This monster can attack
three times.

00:38:33.269 --> 00:38:36.907 position:5% line:83% align:start
First, shatter
his Krystal Dragons!

00:38:48.317 --> 00:38:51.921 position:75% line:89% align:start
No! No!

00:38:51.954 --> 00:38:53.456 position:35% line:89% align:start
No, Seto!

00:38:53.489 --> 00:38:56.425 position:27% line:89% align:start
Aaah! Agh! Ohh.

00:38:56.459 --> 00:38:59.395 position:5% line:83% align:start
And with
this final attack...

00:38:59.428 --> 00:39:01.964 position:5% line:83% align:start
there will be
nothing left of you!

00:39:04.834 --> 00:39:06.435 position:5% line:89% align:start
Farewell!

00:39:08.304 --> 00:39:11.907 position:50% line:83% align:start
I play my trap!
Go Counter Gate!

00:39:11.941 --> 00:39:13.943 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's this?!

00:39:13.976 --> 00:39:17.847 position:24% line:83% align:start
It stops your attack
and I get to draw a card.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:20.916 position:24% line:83% align:start
And if I should happen
to draw a monster card...

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:22.752 position:41% line:89% align:start
I get to summon it.

00:39:22.785 --> 00:39:27.056 position:5% line:83% align:start
That won't be happening.
I play my trap!

00:39:27.089 --> 00:39:29.591 position:5% line:89% align:start
Cubic Mandala!

00:39:29.624 --> 00:39:32.061 position:5% line:83% align:start
It returns all your dragons
from your graveyard

00:39:32.094 --> 00:39:37.499 position:5% line:83% align:start
back to your field so you have
no room to summon a new monster!

00:39:37.532 --> 00:39:40.468 position:5% line:83% align:start
Aww, they don't look
so healthy, do they?

00:39:40.502 --> 00:39:43.705 position:5% line:83% align:start
It means they've lost
their special abilities!

00:39:43.738 --> 00:39:46.441 position:5% line:89% align:start
In other words, you lose!

00:39:46.474 --> 00:39:48.510 position:33% line:89% align:start
Can't be...

00:39:51.513 --> 00:39:54.883 position:21% line:83% align:start
No...
this won't be how it ends.

00:39:57.886 --> 00:40:00.488 position:38% line:83% align:start
Not after everything
I've done.

00:40:00.522 --> 00:40:03.625 position:16% line:83% align:start
Not after all the sacrifices
I've made.

00:40:03.658 --> 00:40:07.061 position:27% line:83% align:start
Not when I'm so close
to reviving the Pharaoh.

00:40:10.364 --> 00:40:13.333 position:33% line:89% align:start
I will duel him again!

00:40:13.367 --> 00:40:15.770 position:35% line:89% align:start
(yelling)

00:40:21.009 --> 00:40:23.011 position:5% line:89% align:start
What trickery is this?!

00:40:26.948 --> 00:40:28.049 position:75% line:89% align:start
I draw!

00:40:32.452 --> 00:40:33.687 position:5% line:89% align:start
What's happening?!

00:40:42.029 --> 00:40:42.963 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aah!

00:40:51.171 --> 00:40:53.073 position:35% line:89% align:start
(snarling)

00:40:56.844 --> 00:40:59.646 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's Obelisk the Tormentor!

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.082 position:19% line:83% align:start
An Egyptian God Card!
But how?!

00:41:02.115 --> 00:41:04.685 position:19% line:89% align:start
Those no longer exist!

00:41:06.552 --> 00:41:08.387 position:5% line:89% align:start
This can't be.

00:41:08.421 --> 00:41:09.790 position:5% line:83% align:start
When the Pharaoh
left this realm,

00:41:09.823 --> 00:41:13.793 position:5% line:83% align:start
so did the Egyptian God Cards.
Do my eyes deceive me?

00:41:13.827 --> 00:41:17.430 position:5% line:83% align:start
How did Kaiba make
the impossible possible

00:41:17.463 --> 00:41:19.066 position:5% line:83% align:start
and raise
from the ancient beyond

00:41:19.099 --> 00:41:22.035 position:5% line:83% align:start
one of the Pharaoh's
mightiest monsters?

00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:24.104 position:58% line:89% align:start
I activate...

00:41:24.137 --> 00:41:27.074 position:35% line:89% align:start
Obelisk's... ability!

00:41:27.107 --> 00:41:29.041 position:41% line:83% align:start
By destroying
all of my monsters,

00:41:29.075 --> 00:41:32.745 position:19% line:83% align:start
you take damage equal
to Obelisk's attack points!

00:41:35.114 --> 00:41:37.950 position:5% line:83% align:start
But your monster
can't use its abilities!

00:41:37.984 --> 00:41:42.154 position:44% line:83% align:start
It's no monster...
it's a god!

00:41:42.188 --> 00:41:43.823 position:16% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:41:43.856 --> 00:41:47.827 position:24% line:89% align:start
Attack with Fist of Fury!

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.737 position:5% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:06.178 position:38% line:83% align:start
(laughs)
All right!

00:42:06.212 --> 00:42:07.646 position:44% line:83% align:start
Huh?
Uhh!

00:42:12.151 --> 00:42:13.785 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kaiba...

00:42:15.787 --> 00:42:17.123 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm still standing!

00:42:17.156 --> 00:42:18.690 position:72% line:83% align:start
(Mokuba)
Big bro!

00:42:20.126 --> 00:42:21.660 position:30% line:89% align:start
We're all set!

00:42:21.693 --> 00:42:22.894 position:69% line:89% align:start
Let's go!

00:42:23.862 --> 00:42:25.630 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, no, the puzzle!

00:42:25.664 --> 00:42:27.699 position:10% line:89% align:start
The boy's escaping with it!

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.835 position:27% line:89% align:start
Later!

00:42:33.238 --> 00:42:34.839 position:47% line:89% align:start
I don't think so.

00:42:48.519 --> 00:42:50.521 position:5% line:83% align:start
(Kaiba)
Aigami!

00:42:50.554 --> 00:42:52.656 position:5% line:89% align:start
To be continued.

00:43:08.639 --> 00:43:09.873 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:43:26.857 --> 00:43:29.626 position:16% line:89% align:start
I-I don't believe it...

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:31.095 position:24% line:89% align:start
Can it really be?

00:43:35.766 --> 00:43:38.102 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:43:39.602 --> 00:43:43.173 position:44% line:83% align:start
Huh?
Whoa, did I... oversleep?

00:43:43.207 --> 00:43:46.509 position:19% line:89% align:start
This is not my pillow!

00:43:47.844 --> 00:43:49.046 position:64% line:89% align:start
(chuckling)

00:43:49.079 --> 00:43:52.116 position:38% line:83% align:start
Kaiba?!
You're not my pillow either!

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:54.851 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:43:54.884 --> 00:43:57.121 position:5% line:83% align:start
That there on your arm,
is that the new Duel Disk?

00:43:57.154 --> 00:43:59.323 position:52% line:89% align:start
Yes... it is...

00:43:59.356 --> 00:44:03.126 position:33% line:83% align:start
but you can't have it!
You're not worthy!

00:44:03.159 --> 00:44:04.294 position:66% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:44:04.328 --> 00:44:06.296 position:5% line:83% align:start
I am so!
Hey!

00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:08.865 position:5% line:89% align:start
Stop laughing!

00:44:08.898 --> 00:44:12.668 position:5% line:83% align:start
I am, so, worthy!
I am, sooooooo...

00:44:12.702 --> 00:44:15.104 position:35% line:89% align:start
(gasping)

00:44:15.138 --> 00:44:16.973 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:44:17.006 --> 00:44:20.209 position:27% line:83% align:start
Uh... I am so...
dreaming?

00:44:20.243 --> 00:44:21.878 position:66% line:89% align:start
Wake up...

00:44:21.911 --> 00:44:23.179 position:52% line:83% align:start
or I'll make it
a nightmare!

00:44:23.212 --> 00:44:24.647 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:26.581 position:38% line:83% align:start
Anyway, back to what
I was saying...

00:44:26.615 --> 00:44:28.918 position:35% line:83% align:start
"And though we may be
going our own way..."

00:44:28.951 --> 00:44:31.821 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why do we gotta rehearse
our graduation anyhow?

00:44:31.854 --> 00:44:34.123 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, show some respect.

00:44:34.157 --> 00:44:35.757 position:27% line:89% align:start
Respect for who?

00:44:35.791 --> 00:44:37.826 position:13% line:83% align:start
No one's really listenin',
right, T?

00:44:37.859 --> 00:44:40.096 position:33% line:89% align:start
(whimpering)

00:44:40.129 --> 00:44:44.933 position:52% line:83% align:start
Tissues!
I need tissues!

00:44:46.735 --> 00:44:49.138 position:16% line:83% align:start
(Sera)
Diva.

00:44:49.172 --> 00:44:51.706 position:19% line:89% align:start
Diva!

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:52.774 position:52% line:89% align:start
Sera.

00:44:52.808 --> 00:44:55.710 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm told you battled
against Kaiba.

00:44:55.744 --> 00:44:57.145 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:44:57.179 --> 00:44:59.748 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid he's located
the Millennium Puzzle.

00:44:59.781 --> 00:45:02.150 position:5% line:83% align:start
If he's able
to reassemble it...

00:45:02.184 --> 00:45:03.318 position:38% line:89% align:start
I know.

00:45:05.087 --> 00:45:06.888 position:19% line:89% align:start
The Pharaoh will rise.

00:45:06.922 --> 00:45:10.292 position:27% line:83% align:start
But don't worry.
He won't reassemble the puzzle.

00:45:10.325 --> 00:45:11.827 position:35% line:89% align:start
He can't.

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:15.163 position:19% line:83% align:start
And even if he could,
it would not matter.

00:45:15.197 --> 00:45:16.630 position:5% line:89% align:start
What do you mean?

00:45:16.665 --> 00:45:19.134 position:5% line:83% align:start
We'll lose our powers
when the Pharaoh resurrects

00:45:19.167 --> 00:45:20.936 position:5% line:89% align:start
in Yugi's body.

00:45:20.969 --> 00:45:24.306 position:16% line:83% align:start
That won't be a problem
if I get rid of the body.

00:45:24.339 --> 00:45:25.773 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're going too far!

00:45:25.806 --> 00:45:28.043 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're blinded by hate,
brother,

00:45:28.076 --> 00:45:31.113 position:5% line:83% align:start
and if you don't stop,
it will destroy you.

00:45:40.388 --> 00:45:42.290 position:5% line:89% align:start
I still believe in you.

00:45:42.324 --> 00:45:45.260 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just consider
what I've said, brother.

00:45:45.293 --> 00:45:47.329 position:5% line:89% align:start
I beg you.

00:45:47.362 --> 00:45:48.463 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's too late.

00:45:48.497 --> 00:45:52.933 position:5% line:77% align:start
(Joey)
Nah, seriously, Yuge,
I heard the whole speech!

00:45:52.967 --> 00:45:55.970 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, now that rehearsal's over,
you guys wanna chill?

00:45:56.003 --> 00:45:58.105 position:61% line:83% align:start
(Aigami)
Hey... Yugi!

00:46:07.114 --> 00:46:08.716 position:5% line:89% align:start
Awesome!

00:46:08.749 --> 00:46:11.252 position:55% line:83% align:start
No coming back
from that!

00:46:11.285 --> 00:46:13.053 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hooray!
Fun!

00:46:13.087 --> 00:46:15.256 position:5% line:77% align:start
(Joey)
Hey, Aigami.
Check it out!

00:46:15.289 --> 00:46:16.689 position:5% line:89% align:start
Whadaya think?

00:46:16.723 --> 00:46:19.226 position:19% line:89% align:start
Wow, it's a Red-Eyes!

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:21.694 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, me and this card
have been on some adventures!

00:46:21.728 --> 00:46:25.065 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hey, what about you?
Do you like dueling, Aigami?

00:46:25.099 --> 00:46:27.800 position:41% line:83% align:start
Mm-hmm,
but I'm pretty bad.

00:46:27.834 --> 00:46:29.702 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe Yugi can give you
some pointers.

00:46:29.736 --> 00:46:33.006 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, totally, he's really good,
he even beat Seto Kaiba!

00:46:33.039 --> 00:46:35.842 position:44% line:83% align:start
My!
That's impressive!

00:46:35.875 --> 00:46:37.210 position:38% line:83% align:start
(Bakura)
That settles it then.

00:46:37.243 --> 00:46:40.013 position:24% line:83% align:start
You and Yugi ought
to make plans to duel sometime.

00:46:40.046 --> 00:46:42.782 position:35% line:83% align:start
What? Me versus Yugi?
I don't know.

00:46:42.815 --> 00:46:43.883 position:41% line:83% align:start
(Yugi)
It's fine, Aigami.

00:46:43.917 --> 00:46:45.151 position:16% line:89% align:start
Don't feel pressured...

00:46:45.185 --> 00:46:47.854 position:38% line:77% align:start
(Aigami)
No... I mean,
if you're willing...

00:46:47.887 --> 00:46:49.856 position:35% line:83% align:start
then, yes...
I'd love to duel you.

00:46:49.889 --> 00:46:51.758 position:72% line:89% align:start
Awesome!

00:46:51.791 --> 00:46:53.993 position:50% line:83% align:start
And whoever wins
faces this guy!

00:46:54.027 --> 00:46:56.129 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now that's a grand prize
worth fightin' for!

00:46:56.162 --> 00:46:58.298 position:10% line:89% align:start
I have an even better idea.

00:46:58.331 --> 00:47:00.800 position:7% line:83% align:start
Why don't we all get together
later and have a tournament?

00:47:00.833 --> 00:47:02.235 position:50% line:83% align:start
Yeah!
I'll be there!

00:47:02.268 --> 00:47:04.938 position:5% line:77% align:start
(Joey)
Be ready to lose too,
'cause I'm taking you down!

00:47:04.971 --> 00:47:06.406 position:52% line:83% align:start
(Tea)
This'll be fun!

00:47:06.439 --> 00:47:07.373 position:64% line:89% align:start
Can't wait.

00:47:22.488 --> 00:47:25.325 position:38% line:77% align:start

The preparations
are complete, Mr. Kaiba.

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:39.871 position:5% line:89% align:start
All is set.

00:47:39.905 --> 00:47:41.773 position:7% line:89% align:start
Then I'm going to the station.

00:47:41.807 --> 00:47:45.043 position:16% line:83% align:start
Roland, while I'm away,
plan for a duel exhibition.

00:47:45.077 --> 00:47:47.012 position:19% line:83% align:start
I want to give Domino
a demonstration

00:47:47.045 --> 00:47:49.314 position:21% line:89% align:start
of my new Duel Disk.

00:47:49.348 --> 00:47:50.549 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sir!

00:47:50.582 --> 00:47:51.917 position:30% line:89% align:start
I want it big.

00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:54.353 position:24% line:83% align:start
The biggest Domino
has ever seen!

00:48:47.405 --> 00:48:51.075 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>Greetings, Master Kaiba!</i>
 <i>I've been expecting you.</i>

00:48:51.108 --> 00:48:53.511 position:19% line:89% align:start
 <i>The machine is ready.</i>

00:48:53.544 --> 00:48:54.944 position:16% line:89% align:start
Then let's get to work.

00:48:54.978 --> 00:48:56.414 position:30% line:89% align:start
 <i>Affirmative.</i>

00:49:22.472 --> 00:49:26.644 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't you think I know that?
I invented the blasted thing!

00:49:26.677 --> 00:49:29.279 position:30% line:83% align:start
 <i>Affirmative.</i>

00:49:43.226 --> 00:49:47.863 position:27% line:83% align:start
And very soon...
I'll get my glory.

00:49:55.938 --> 00:49:58.073 position:38% line:77% align:start
(Aigami)
I can't tell you how much
I've been looking forward

00:49:58.107 --> 00:49:59.309 position:27% line:89% align:start
to dueling Yugi.

00:49:59.342 --> 00:50:01.511 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've thought of nothing else
all day.

00:50:01.544 --> 00:50:04.414 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's going to be
such fun, I'm sure.

00:50:04.447 --> 00:50:06.915 position:35% line:83% align:start
Hey, Aigami...
what's with the cube?

00:50:06.949 --> 00:50:09.017 position:41% line:89% align:start
This?

00:50:09.051 --> 00:50:11.920 position:38% line:83% align:start
Well...
it's precious to me.

00:50:11.954 --> 00:50:13.656 position:7% line:89% align:start
Like your Duel Disk is to you.

00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:16.291 position:5% line:83% align:start
It looks like
an antique.

00:50:16.325 --> 00:50:17.993 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yes, that's because it is.

00:50:18.026 --> 00:50:21.130 position:21% line:83% align:start
Someone very special
gave this to me.

00:50:21.163 --> 00:50:22.598 position:5% line:89% align:start
You know, Aigami...

00:50:22.631 --> 00:50:25.300 position:5% line:83% align:start
my father happened
to be an antiques dealer.

00:50:25.334 --> 00:50:28.270 position:5% line:83% align:start
He and I travelled
all over the world together.

00:50:28.303 --> 00:50:30.706 position:5% line:83% align:start
In fact, before we
settled down here,

00:50:30.739 --> 00:50:32.474 position:5% line:89% align:start
we were living over in Egypt.

00:50:32.508 --> 00:50:34.309 position:41% line:89% align:start
Egypt?

00:50:34.343 --> 00:50:37.479 position:30% line:83% align:start
You don't say.
Tell me more...

00:50:37.513 --> 00:50:38.480 position:38% line:89% align:start
Bakura.

00:50:40.616 --> 00:50:42.618 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, and don't forget
to lock up!

00:50:46.988 --> 00:50:49.090 position:10% line:83% align:start
No way could I build a deck
without this card!

00:50:49.123 --> 00:50:52.728 position:10% line:83% align:start
You've gotten me out of more
dueling jams than I can count!

00:50:52.761 --> 00:50:53.995 position:61% line:83% align:start
(Sera)
It's lovely.

00:50:54.028 --> 00:50:56.598 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:50:56.632 --> 00:50:58.366 position:50% line:89% align:start
That golden box.

00:50:58.399 --> 00:51:00.234 position:33% line:89% align:start
It has a kind of glow.

00:51:00.268 --> 00:51:02.604 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sorry, I didn't
hear you come in.

00:51:02.638 --> 00:51:08.109 position:5% line:83% align:start
But... you're right.
This box is very special.

00:51:08.142 --> 00:51:11.012 position:5% line:83% align:start
You see...
it's where I keep my duel cards.

00:51:11.045 --> 00:51:13.247 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not every one of them,
of course,

00:51:13.281 --> 00:51:15.616 position:5% line:83% align:start
just the ones
that are extra precious to me.

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:19.487 position:7% line:83% align:start
Of course, but I think you mean
cards extra precious to you...

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:23.191 position:44% line:83% align:start
and extra precious
to the Pharaoh.

00:51:23.224 --> 00:51:24.525 position:58% line:89% align:start
I know, Yugi.

00:51:24.559 --> 00:51:27.261 position:30% line:83% align:start
I know of the Pharaoh
because of my master...

00:51:27.295 --> 00:51:31.265 position:55% line:83% align:start
Master Shin...
Shadi Shin.

00:51:34.202 --> 00:51:36.471 position:38% line:83% align:start
Not long ago,
Master Shin bestowed

00:51:36.504 --> 00:51:40.140 position:38% line:83% align:start
on myself and others
a great power.

00:51:40.173 --> 00:51:43.143 position:21% line:89% align:start
the power... of the Plana.

00:51:43.176 --> 00:51:44.445 position:27% line:89% align:start
This power is so strong,

00:51:44.479 --> 00:51:46.581 position:24% line:89% align:start
it can remake this world,

00:51:46.614 --> 00:51:49.650 position:38% line:83% align:start
turn it into
someplace beautiful.

00:51:49.684 --> 00:51:52.018 position:69% line:89% align:start
A utopia.

00:51:52.052 --> 00:51:56.189 position:21% line:83% align:start
But if misused, this power
could do the opposite.

00:52:01.194 --> 00:52:02.496 position:30% line:89% align:start
Where are we?

00:52:02.529 --> 00:52:06.099 position:19% line:83% align:start
This is the gathering place
of the Plana.

00:52:06.132 --> 00:52:07.434 position:41% line:89% align:start
Plana?

00:52:07.467 --> 00:52:11.638 position:16% line:83% align:start
We are the ones who carry on
the will of Master Shin.

00:52:11.671 --> 00:52:13.573 position:30% line:83% align:start
But there is dissension
among us.

00:52:13.607 --> 00:52:17.611 position:24% line:83% align:start
And it could mean trouble
for all of mankind.

00:52:17.644 --> 00:52:22.749 position:13% line:83% align:start
I have no one else to turn to
other than you, Yugi.

00:52:22.782 --> 00:52:24.584 position:5% line:89% align:start
Who are you?

00:52:24.618 --> 00:52:26.486 position:66% line:89% align:start
I am Sera.

00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:28.788 position:44% line:83% align:start
Destiny has led me
to you.

00:52:28.822 --> 00:52:32.626 position:33% line:83% align:start
So I shall entrust you
with my destiny.

00:52:36.295 --> 00:52:37.396 position:41% line:89% align:start
Whoa!

00:52:41.166 --> 00:52:43.803 position:16% line:89% align:start
That was... so strange.

00:52:48.274 --> 00:52:49.776 position:38% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:52:52.879 --> 00:52:54.146 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>Master Kaibam, it is impossible</i>

00:52:54.179 --> 00:52:57.349 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>to reconstruct the millennium</i>
 <i>puzzle any further.</i>

00:52:57.383 --> 00:52:59.418 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's no such thing
as impossible.

00:52:59.451 --> 00:53:01.420 position:21% line:83% align:start
Stop making excuses

00:53:01.453 --> 00:53:03.155 position:35% line:89% align:start
 <i>Negative.</i>

He'll pay.

00:53:13.799 --> 00:53:15.768 position:5% line:89% align:start
I... don't feel well.

00:53:15.801 --> 00:53:17.870 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh, what was that?

00:53:17.903 --> 00:53:19.237 position:35% line:89% align:start
Are you okay, Bakura?

00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:21.607 position:38% line:83% align:start
Please.
You were saying...

00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:22.741 position:33% line:89% align:start
about Egypt?

00:53:22.775 --> 00:53:25.243 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh... my... I...

00:53:25.276 --> 00:53:27.446 position:5% line:83% align:start
don't want to relive
that memory.

00:53:30.683 --> 00:53:34.285 position:5% line:83% align:start
My father received word that an
artifact he'd been searching for

00:53:34.319 --> 00:53:36.755 position:5% line:83% align:start
was in a place
called the Valley of the Kings.

00:53:36.789 --> 00:53:38.356 position:5% line:89% align:start
It was a special artifact.

00:53:38.389 --> 00:53:41.392 position:5% line:83% align:start
One that he'd been looking for
all his life.

00:53:41.426 --> 00:53:44.429 position:5% line:83% align:start
So he set off
for this valley to acquire it.

00:53:44.462 --> 00:53:47.799 position:5% line:83% align:start
For some reason,
I was worried about his journey,

00:53:47.832 --> 00:53:49.801 position:5% line:89% align:start
so I secretly followed him.

00:53:49.834 --> 00:53:51.469 position:5% line:89% align:start
I remember the sky.

00:53:51.502 --> 00:53:53.638 position:5% line:89% align:start
So peaceful, so clear.

00:53:53.671 --> 00:53:57.542 position:38% line:77% align:start
(groans)
No... why am I talking
about this?

00:53:57.575 --> 00:53:59.877 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't want to revisit
the terrible things

00:53:59.911 --> 00:54:02.347 position:13% line:89% align:start
that happened that night!

00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:04.415 position:50% line:83% align:start
Bakura!
What's going on?

00:54:04.449 --> 00:54:06.116 position:50% line:89% align:start
Talk to me, pal!

00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:11.723 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hey, what the...

00:54:11.756 --> 00:54:15.793 position:13% line:83% align:start
Uh... we take a wrong turn
somewhere?

00:54:15.827 --> 00:54:19.329 position:35% line:83% align:start
I know...
I'm dreamin' again!

00:54:25.602 --> 00:54:28.505 position:21% line:83% align:start
Or maybe nightmarin'
is a better word.

00:54:28.538 --> 00:54:30.875 position:50% line:83% align:start
This is no dream
or nightmare.

00:54:30.908 --> 00:54:34.277 position:24% line:83% align:start
What you are experiencing
right now...

00:54:34.311 --> 00:54:36.513 position:44% line:83% align:start
is a result of we,
the Plana.

00:54:36.546 --> 00:54:39.816 position:16% line:83% align:start
Our powers are transforming
your world right before you.

00:54:39.850 --> 00:54:41.551 position:33% line:89% align:start
Your powers?

00:54:41.585 --> 00:54:42.954 position:38% line:83% align:start
Aigami,
what are you talking about?!

00:54:42.987 --> 00:54:44.721 position:66% line:89% align:start
Ahhh, yes.

00:54:44.755 --> 00:54:47.324 position:24% line:83% align:start
I forgot, you're
the slow one, aren't you?

00:54:47.357 --> 00:54:51.828 position:38% line:83% align:start
All you need to know
is I need you gone.

00:54:51.862 --> 00:54:52.929 position:19% line:89% align:start
I ain't goin' nowhere!

00:54:56.767 --> 00:54:58.769 position:24% line:83% align:start
You and your goons
don't scare me none.

00:54:58.802 --> 00:55:01.672 position:16% line:83% align:start
But we are outnumbered.
Bakura!

00:55:01.705 --> 00:55:05.241 position:38% line:83% align:start
Get up!
We gotta get outta here!

00:55:05.274 --> 00:55:08.645 position:33% line:83% align:start
He's zonked!
'Cause a' you!

00:55:08.679 --> 00:55:10.279 position:44% line:89% align:start
Rrr!

00:55:10.312 --> 00:55:11.548 position:55% line:89% align:start
Violence, huh?

00:55:11.581 --> 00:55:13.684 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's so very typical
of your kind.

00:55:13.717 --> 00:55:14.885 position:16% line:89% align:start
Kind?

00:55:14.918 --> 00:55:15.886 position:30% line:89% align:start
And that's why, Joey...

00:55:15.919 --> 00:55:18.922 position:33% line:83% align:start
you'll now be banished
like all of the rest.

00:55:18.955 --> 00:55:21.657 position:35% line:83% align:start
Prepare to enter into
a world more fitting

00:55:21.691 --> 00:55:23.592 position:47% line:83% align:start

A dimension that reflects
your own feeble soul!

00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:30.499 position:21% line:83% align:start
And in this world, Joey...
you will forever stay!

00:55:30.533 --> 00:55:33.569 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's enough outta you!

00:55:35.404 --> 00:55:37.640 position:5% line:89% align:start
I... I can't move.

00:55:37.673 --> 00:55:41.477 position:52% line:83% align:start
Farewell, Joey!
Now... begone!

(clock chiming)

00:55:46.816 --> 00:55:49.919 position:38% line:83% align:start
A piece
of the millennium puzzle...

00:55:49.952 --> 00:55:52.253 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's getting late.

00:55:52.287 --> 00:55:53.522 position:24% line:89% align:start
Where is everyone?

00:55:53.556 --> 00:55:55.290 position:33% line:89% align:start
(door opens)

00:55:55.323 --> 00:55:57.793 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, Tristan!

00:55:57.827 --> 00:56:01.329 position:44% line:83% align:start
Yugi, the playdate
is cancelled!

00:56:01.362 --> 00:56:02.565 position:16% line:89% align:start
Wha...

00:56:02.598 --> 00:56:05.500 position:13% line:83% align:start
Come on!
Something's happened to Joey!

00:56:16.444 --> 00:56:18.881 position:41% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:56:18.914 --> 00:56:20.548 position:35% line:89% align:start
Huh? Wha?!

00:56:20.582 --> 00:56:22.550 position:30% line:89% align:start
Where... am I?

00:56:22.584 --> 00:56:24.452 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, back here.

00:56:24.486 --> 00:56:27.555 position:24% line:83% align:start
Looks like things
are normal again.

00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:28.857 position:33% line:89% align:start
Or are they?

00:56:28.890 --> 00:56:29.991 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:56:36.397 --> 00:56:37.699 position:24% line:89% align:start
 <i>You look scared.</i>

00:56:37.732 --> 00:56:39.834 position:35% line:83% align:start
Why, you--
Aigami!

00:56:39.868 --> 00:56:41.369 position:33% line:89% align:start
What gives?!

No way, my world

00:57:05.559 --> 00:57:07.594 position:27% line:83% align:start
 <i>Do you remember</i>

00:57:15.936 --> 00:57:18.939 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>in surroundings so colorless</i>

00:57:18.972 --> 00:57:22.342 position:24% line:83% align:start
Quit your yappin'!

00:57:56.642 --> 00:57:59.812 position:10% line:83% align:start
Man, how long is this street

00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:05.052 position:19% line:89% align:start
 <i>Not too much longer.</i>

00:58:05.085 --> 00:58:08.487 position:5% line:83% align:start

Whatever, chump!

I may not be an A student,

but that don't mean
I can't remember stuff!

Like that's Sanpei's

Sanpei, where ya going?

00:58:27.874 --> 00:58:29.675 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>You're a fool, Joey...</i>

 <i>Do you really think you can win</i>

00:58:33.511 --> 00:58:35.447 position:7% line:89% align:start
 <i>No one here knows you exist.</i>

00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:40.820 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>And as we speak, I will erase</i>
 <i>these memories one by one.</i>

00:58:40.853 --> 00:58:44.123 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>Every face you've seen.</i>
 <i>Every day you've known.</i>

00:58:44.156 --> 00:58:45.825 position:33% line:89% align:start
 <i>Terminated!</i>

00:58:45.858 --> 00:58:48.094 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>And since a man is nothing</i>
 <i>without his memories,</i>

00:58:48.127 --> 00:58:51.998 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>once they're all gone,</i>
 <i>you'll be gone, too!</i>

00:58:53.765 --> 00:58:55.067 position:35% line:89% align:start
 <i>Farewell.</i>

00:58:57.136 --> 00:58:59.437 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's just not like Joey...

00:58:59.471 --> 00:59:01.039 position:5% line:83% align:start
He'd never abandon
his Duel Disk.

00:59:01.072 --> 00:59:03.108 position:13% line:83% align:start
Totally, there's no chance
he'd leave this behind.

00:59:03.141 --> 00:59:05.143 position:44% line:83% align:start
I spoke with Joey
earlier in the day

00:59:05.176 --> 00:59:07.946 position:10% line:83% align:start
and he said he was hanging out
with Bakura and Aigami.

00:59:07.979 --> 00:59:10.515 position:44% line:83% align:start
If we find them,
we might find him!

00:59:10.548 --> 00:59:15.720 position:5% line:83% align:start
Bakura, you said you didn't want
to relive the terrible things

00:59:15.754 --> 00:59:18.490 position:16% line:83% align:start
that happened that night
in Egypt.

00:59:18.523 --> 00:59:20.191 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, I don't blame you...

00:59:20.225 --> 00:59:22.827 position:21% line:83% align:start
because I was there
and I can promise you

00:59:22.861 --> 00:59:25.730 position:19% line:83% align:start
it haunts my memories
even more than yours!

00:59:28.233 --> 00:59:33.872 position:5% line:77% align:start
(Sera)
Master Shin, tell us again
why you chose us.

00:59:33.905 --> 00:59:36.908 position:19% line:83% align:start
Because... as children
you can understand things

00:59:36.942 --> 00:59:39.476 position:10% line:89% align:start
in a way no adult ever can.

00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:41.212 position:16% line:89% align:start
I don't get it.

00:59:41.246 --> 00:59:42.981 position:47% line:89% align:start
Yeah... I mean...

00:59:43.014 --> 00:59:45.250 position:21% line:83% align:start
So what if we're children,
Master Shin?

00:59:45.283 --> 00:59:48.652 position:10% line:83% align:start
How does that make us
understand things differently?

00:59:48.686 --> 00:59:50.155 position:27% line:89% align:start
You see, Diva...

00:59:50.188 --> 00:59:53.258 position:7% line:83% align:start
a child's judgment has not yet
been consumed by fear.

00:59:53.291 --> 00:59:55.626 position:44% line:89% align:start
So fear... is bad?

00:59:55.659 --> 00:59:58.062 position:5% line:83% align:start
That is correct,
because fear...

00:59:58.095 --> 00:59:59.530 position:5% line:89% align:start
turns into hate.

00:59:59.563 --> 01:00:02.633 position:55% line:77% align:start
(Manny)
Umm... I still
don't get it.

01:00:02.666 --> 01:00:05.035 position:52% line:83% align:start
Why does fear
turn into hate?

01:00:05.069 --> 01:00:06.136 position:35% line:89% align:start
Because...

01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:08.739 position:19% line:83% align:start
fear tricks and clouds
your judgment.

01:00:08.772 --> 01:00:11.275 position:30% line:83% align:start
Oh, I think I know
what you're saying now.

01:00:11.308 --> 01:00:13.110 position:30% line:83% align:start
When someone is scared,
they can forget

01:00:13.143 --> 01:00:15.679 position:35% line:83% align:start
to do the right thing
and lash out...

01:00:15.713 --> 01:00:17.748 position:41% line:83% align:start
and end up angry
at the whole world.

01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:20.117 position:35% line:89% align:start
Very good, young one.

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:24.788 position:10% line:83% align:start
And they often take out this
anger in the form of aggression.

01:00:24.822 --> 01:00:26.622 position:7% line:89% align:start
Sadly, this has been the cause

01:00:26.656 --> 01:00:28.624 position:16% line:83% align:start
of the world's failings
for millennia.

01:00:28.658 --> 01:00:30.827 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about me!

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:31.929 position:16% line:89% align:start
Ever since you saved me,

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:33.696 position:16% line:83% align:start
I haven't felt a moment
of fear!

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:37.101 position:10% line:83% align:start
And as long as I'm with you,
I'll never feel fear again!

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:41.105 position:5% line:83% align:start
Young one, that is the very
definition of fear.

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:42.872 position:16% line:89% align:start
It is?

01:00:42.905 --> 01:00:45.942 position:30% line:83% align:start
My children...
please, listen closely.

01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:47.810 position:16% line:83% align:start
When the seven treasures
are inserted

01:00:47.844 --> 01:00:49.812 position:13% line:89% align:start
into the Pharaoh's stone,

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:52.081 position:13% line:83% align:start
the door to the afterlife
will open,

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:55.818 position:19% line:83% align:start
and the Pharaoh's soul
will finally be able to move on.

01:00:55.852 --> 01:00:58.221 position:24% line:83% align:start
When this happens,
young ones...

01:00:58.254 --> 01:01:01.057 position:24% line:83% align:start
the Plana's power
will be yours to wield...

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:03.059 position:13% line:89% align:start
and wield as you see fit.

01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:06.595 position:16% line:83% align:start
Which is why I teach you
these lessons.

01:01:06.629 --> 01:01:10.066 position:5% line:83% align:start
Because I may not always be here
to give you guidance.

01:01:10.099 --> 01:01:15.071 position:13% line:83% align:start
My hope, however, is that
I will remain in your hearts.

01:01:15.104 --> 01:01:18.041 position:21% line:83% align:start
And now, young ones,
there is one last matter.

01:01:18.074 --> 01:01:21.010 position:24% line:83% align:start
It is not a lesson
but a warning.

01:01:21.044 --> 01:01:24.846 position:27% line:83% align:start
And one you must
always remember.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.848 position:27% line:83% align:start
When the Pharaoh
leaves this world,

01:01:26.882 --> 01:01:29.684 position:19% line:83% align:start
the power of the Plana
will be granted.

01:01:29.718 --> 01:01:32.355 position:41% line:83% align:start
But...
should he ever return...

01:01:32.388 --> 01:01:34.856 position:10% line:89% align:start
this power will be recanted.

01:01:36.292 --> 01:01:38.693 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yes, master...

01:01:38.727 --> 01:01:39.828 position:27% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:01:42.030 --> 01:01:44.266 position:24% line:89% align:start
(grunting softly)

01:01:45.333 --> 01:01:48.637 position:30% line:83% align:start
Young ones...
stay and do not follow.

01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:50.005 position:5% line:89% align:start
At last...

01:01:50.038 --> 01:01:52.274 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've finally found
this place!

01:01:52.307 --> 01:01:54.910 position:5% line:83% align:start
(gasps)
And there it is!

01:01:54.943 --> 01:01:57.679 position:24% line:89% align:start
The Ancient Stone!

01:01:57.712 --> 01:02:00.015 position:38% line:83% align:start
And just
as the ancient texts said,

01:02:00.048 --> 01:02:02.217 position:7% line:89% align:start
the Golden Ring is inside it!

01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:04.352 position:24% line:83% align:start
Whatever you want,
I'll pay it!

01:02:04.386 --> 01:02:07.355 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just tell me what your price is
and I'll see to it!

01:02:07.389 --> 01:02:09.757 position:19% line:89% align:start
I must have that ring!

01:02:09.790 --> 01:02:11.193 position:5% line:89% align:start
You are mistaken.

01:02:11.226 --> 01:02:14.895 position:5% line:83% align:start
The millennium ring is not
an object one can possess.

01:02:14.929 --> 01:02:16.931 position:5% line:89% align:start
It possesses you.

01:02:16.964 --> 01:02:20.000 position:5% line:83% align:start
It has powers that even I
do not fully understand.

01:02:20.034 --> 01:02:23.037 position:5% line:89% align:start
Great and terrible powers.

01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:24.406 position:55% line:83% align:start
So?
I do not care!

01:02:24.439 --> 01:02:28.175 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've been searching for it
my whole life!

01:02:28.209 --> 01:02:30.111 position:64% line:89% align:start
Please sir!

01:02:30.144 --> 01:02:32.646 position:5% line:83% align:start
It is not my place
to interfere...

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:34.648 position:5% line:83% align:start
with what destiny
has in store.

01:02:34.682 --> 01:02:35.916 position:5% line:89% align:start
You've been warned.

01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:38.919 position:5% line:83% align:start
But if you still want the ring,
it's yours.

01:02:38.953 --> 01:02:42.156 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yes, yes, yes, I want it!
What must I do?!

01:02:44.091 --> 01:02:48.395 position:5% line:83% align:start
Go take the ring and place it
around your neck.

01:02:48.429 --> 01:02:50.231 position:58% line:89% align:start
Yes... yes...

01:02:54.701 --> 01:02:58.705 position:5% line:83% align:start
It will decide
if you are worthy.

01:02:58.738 --> 01:03:00.807 position:47% line:89% align:start
It feels amazing!

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:03.776 position:47% line:83% align:start
Like nothing I've
ever experienced!

01:03:03.810 --> 01:03:06.380 position:41% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

01:03:10.484 --> 01:03:11.985 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

01:03:16.257 --> 01:03:18.091 position:33% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

01:03:18.124 --> 01:03:19.159 position:44% line:89% align:start
No!

01:03:24.264 --> 01:03:25.665 position:35% line:89% align:start
(gasping)

01:03:26.799 --> 01:03:28.168 position:33% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:32.372 position:64% line:89% align:start
Papa! Papa.

01:03:34.374 --> 01:03:38.077 position:5% line:83% align:start
The ring.
Where is it?

01:03:38.111 --> 01:03:40.046 position:16% line:89% align:start
Where?

01:03:40.079 --> 01:03:42.415 position:41% line:83% align:start
There.
I'll go get it!

01:03:47.954 --> 01:03:49.255 position:66% line:89% align:start
Oh, no!

01:03:49.289 --> 01:03:52.091 position:16% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:07.507 position:44% line:89% align:start
Are you all right?

01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:10.276 position:5% line:89% align:start
(evil laughter)

01:04:10.310 --> 01:04:15.013 position:5% line:83% align:start
Shadi, your services
will no longer be required.

01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:19.718 position:19% line:89% align:start
Now be gone, old man!

01:04:22.054 --> 01:04:24.323 position:44% line:83% align:start
No!
Master Shin!

01:04:24.356 --> 01:04:25.924 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

01:04:25.958 --> 01:04:27.459 position:30% line:89% align:start
(all gasping)

01:04:27.492 --> 01:04:28.493 position:33% line:89% align:start
Master Shin!

01:04:28.527 --> 01:04:29.528 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you okay?!

01:04:29.561 --> 01:04:31.430 position:55% line:89% align:start
Say something!

01:04:31.463 --> 01:04:32.531 position:16% line:89% align:start
Remember, young ones...

01:04:32.564 --> 01:04:37.269 position:10% line:83% align:start
do not give into your fears,
do not give into hate.

01:04:37.302 --> 01:04:40.239 position:10% line:83% align:start
One day, the seven treasures
will become one

01:04:40.272 --> 01:04:43.976 position:10% line:83% align:start
with the Pharaoh's stone...
you must be ready...

01:04:44.009 --> 01:04:47.479 position:7% line:83% align:start
you must find harmony between
the forces of good and evil

01:04:47.512 --> 01:04:50.315 position:19% line:83% align:start
like the most precious
of these treasures.

01:04:50.349 --> 01:04:53.951 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hold on, Master Shin!
Please hold on!

01:04:53.985 --> 01:04:57.489 position:66% line:83% align:start
Diva...
take this.

01:04:57.522 --> 01:04:59.056 position:38% line:89% align:start
When the time comes,

01:04:59.090 --> 01:05:01.792 position:24% line:83% align:start
use it to wield the power
of the Plana.

01:05:01.826 --> 01:05:03.327 position:33% line:89% align:start
You must carry it now,

01:05:03.362 --> 01:05:07.432 position:16% line:83% align:start
for my time in this world...
is complete.

01:05:12.970 --> 01:05:16.007 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't leave us!
Please come back.

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:18.442 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't waste all your tears
on him..

01:05:18.476 --> 01:05:21.379 position:5% line:83% align:start
You really ought to save
some for each other!

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:23.781 position:33% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

01:05:27.852 --> 01:05:29.819 position:13% line:89% align:start
I like this new host body.

01:05:29.853 --> 01:05:31.122 position:10% line:89% align:start
I think we'll be able to do

01:05:31.155 --> 01:05:34.492 position:10% line:83% align:start
all kinds of terrible things
together.

01:05:34.525 --> 01:05:37.261 position:21% line:89% align:start
(sinister laughter)

01:05:42.566 --> 01:05:46.504 position:38% line:77% align:start
(Aigami)
 <i>That's right...</i>
 <i>it was you, Bakura.</i>

01:05:46.537 --> 01:05:49.039 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please, Aigami...
just listen to me--

01:05:49.072 --> 01:05:51.007 position:24% line:89% align:start
I don't want to listen...

01:05:51.041 --> 01:05:54.412 position:38% line:83% align:start
What I want is
to avenge my master!

01:05:54.445 --> 01:05:58.882 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know...
but it wasn't my fault.

01:05:58.915 --> 01:06:00.250 position:5% line:89% align:start
The ring did it, not me.

01:06:00.283 --> 01:06:03.520 position:30% line:83% align:start
You lie! You're just
trying to save yourself

01:06:03.554 --> 01:06:04.854 position:35% line:89% align:start
but it will not work!

01:06:04.888 --> 01:06:06.489 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm not lying!

01:06:06.523 --> 01:06:09.526 position:5% line:83% align:start
The ring used to control me,
but it no longer does!

01:06:09.559 --> 01:06:11.027 position:5% line:89% align:start
(sobbing)

01:06:11.061 --> 01:06:15.131 position:5% line:89% align:start
Still... I am so sorry...

01:06:15.165 --> 01:06:17.367 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's not easy to lose someone.

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:21.171 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know because I lost someone
as well on that day.

01:06:24.074 --> 01:06:25.442 position:58% line:89% align:start
So you did...

01:06:28.111 --> 01:06:29.579 position:27% line:89% align:start
This isn't good!

01:06:29.612 --> 01:06:32.014 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's like my memories are
vanishing faster than before!

01:06:32.047 --> 01:06:36.051 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's gotta be something
I can do to stand up to this.

01:06:39.054 --> 01:06:41.624 position:7% line:89% align:start
Great, now I can't even stand.

01:06:41.658 --> 01:06:42.625 position:38% line:89% align:start
My foot!

01:06:48.498 --> 01:06:51.900 position:10% line:83% align:start
No, it can't end like this!
It just can't!

01:06:51.934 --> 01:06:55.404 position:5% line:83% align:start
Aigami...
please forgive me.

01:06:55.437 --> 01:06:58.173 position:47% line:83% align:start
Stay away!
You're the enemy!

01:06:58.207 --> 01:07:00.609 position:19% line:89% align:start
Bakura, you ruined my life.

01:07:02.311 --> 01:07:05.614 position:61% line:83% align:start
(Manny)
Yes, he did.

01:07:05.647 --> 01:07:09.485 position:41% line:83% align:start
He ruined all
of our lives, Diva.

01:07:09.518 --> 01:07:10.953 position:5% line:89% align:start
Manny?

01:07:10.986 --> 01:07:12.121 position:66% line:89% align:start
Now do it.

01:07:12.154 --> 01:07:14.056 position:30% line:89% align:start
Take revenge on Bakura.

01:07:14.089 --> 01:07:16.392 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're acting strange,
Manny.

01:07:16.425 --> 01:07:19.495 position:58% line:83% align:start
If you won't,
I will.

01:07:21.963 --> 01:07:24.466 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm going to enjoy this, Bakura.

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:26.668 position:38% line:83% align:start
No, Manny, wait,
this isn't like you!

01:07:26.702 --> 01:07:30.339 position:35% line:83% align:start
But it is.
The new me.

01:07:34.108 --> 01:07:35.276 position:64% line:89% align:start
Impossible!

01:07:35.309 --> 01:07:36.978 position:38% line:83% align:start
Is that
the Millennium Ring?

01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:37.979 position:72% line:89% align:start
But how?

01:07:38.012 --> 01:07:39.347 position:33% line:89% align:start
I found it.

01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:41.149 position:30% line:83% align:start
I came upon it
at the shrine

01:07:41.182 --> 01:07:43.351 position:27% line:83% align:start
after your duel
with Seto Kaiba.

01:07:43.384 --> 01:07:45.286 position:33% line:89% align:start
Manny, listen to me...

01:07:45.319 --> 01:07:47.121 position:47% line:83% align:start
The ring has done
something to you!

01:07:47.155 --> 01:07:48.122 position:55% line:89% align:start
Something bad.

01:07:48.156 --> 01:07:50.024 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

01:07:50.057 --> 01:07:52.360 position:19% line:89% align:start
But it feels so good!

01:07:52.393 --> 01:07:53.394 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:01.402 position:78% line:89% align:start
Manny!

01:08:01.436 --> 01:08:03.204 position:38% line:89% align:start
Diva...

01:08:03.237 --> 01:08:05.740 position:30% line:89% align:start
You are right.

01:08:05.773 --> 01:08:08.476 position:10% line:89% align:start
The ring's infected my soul.

01:08:08.509 --> 01:08:11.712 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm trying
to fight it but...

01:08:11.746 --> 01:08:14.449 position:16% line:89% align:start
it is so very strong...

01:08:14.482 --> 01:08:16.284 position:35% line:89% align:start
(yelling)

01:08:23.658 --> 01:08:25.526 position:41% line:89% align:start
Manny!

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.462 position:44% line:89% align:start
Manny!

01:08:33.033 --> 01:08:34.702 position:41% line:83% align:start
Manny!
I'm coming!

01:08:37.204 --> 01:08:38.538 position:38% line:89% align:start
Manny...

01:08:38.572 --> 01:08:40.040 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm here.

01:08:40.073 --> 01:08:41.408 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm right here with you.

01:08:43.677 --> 01:08:45.545 position:16% line:89% align:start
Must I lose everything?

01:08:46.814 --> 01:08:48.648 position:30% line:89% align:start
Master Shin...

01:08:48.682 --> 01:08:50.550 position:35% line:89% align:start
now Manny.

01:08:50.584 --> 01:08:51.518 position:33% line:89% align:start
Who's next?

01:08:55.455 --> 01:08:59.392 position:19% line:83% align:start
All that's left behind
is this Millennium Ring.

01:08:59.426 --> 01:09:01.661 position:41% line:83% align:start
(Yugi)
Joey!

01:09:01.695 --> 01:09:03.196 position:44% line:89% align:start
Joey!

01:09:09.836 --> 01:09:11.471 position:41% line:77% align:start
Joey!
Joey!

01:09:11.505 --> 01:09:12.706 position:16% line:89% align:start
Joey!

01:09:12.739 --> 01:09:14.006 position:80% line:77% align:start
Joey!
Joey!

01:09:15.842 --> 01:09:18.578 position:38% line:83% align:start
(Aigami)
Looking for someone?

01:09:18.612 --> 01:09:19.980 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hello, Yugi.

01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:24.183 position:50% line:83% align:start
Aigami?
What's going on?

01:09:24.216 --> 01:09:26.720 position:5% line:83% align:start
Aigami...
who are you?

01:09:26.753 --> 01:09:28.420 position:21% line:89% align:start
There is no Aigami.

01:09:28.454 --> 01:09:31.457 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm Diva and we
are the Plana, and...

01:09:31.490 --> 01:09:33.526 position:27% line:83% align:start
we are not ones
to be trifled with.

01:09:33.559 --> 01:09:36.228 position:33% line:83% align:start
Yeah? Then spill
what ya did with Joey!

01:09:36.262 --> 01:09:38.497 position:27% line:83% align:start
I sent him away
to another dimension,

01:09:38.531 --> 01:09:41.066 position:19% line:83% align:start
to a world from which
he will not be returning.

01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:45.271 position:5% line:83% align:start
You should know that your friend
Bakura is long gone, as well.

01:09:45.304 --> 01:09:47.740 position:5% line:89% align:start
And you'll be joining them soon.

01:09:47.773 --> 01:09:51.710 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's your fate.
The fate of all who oppose me.

01:09:51.744 --> 01:09:52.578 position:44% line:89% align:start
We'll stop you!

01:09:52.611 --> 01:09:55.414 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's just it.
There is no stopping us.

01:09:55.447 --> 01:09:57.750 position:16% line:89% align:start
Our power is too great.

01:09:57.783 --> 01:10:01.353 position:19% line:83% align:start
And once I banish you,
vessel of the Pharaoh...

01:10:01.387 --> 01:10:04.423 position:21% line:83% align:start
it will at long last
be absolute.

01:10:04.456 --> 01:10:06.257 position:47% line:89% align:start
Not gonna happen.

01:10:14.365 --> 01:10:17.368 position:16% line:89% align:start
Guess this really is it.

01:10:17.402 --> 01:10:19.103 position:24% line:89% align:start
No more running...

01:10:19.137 --> 01:10:21.139 position:21% line:89% align:start
no more crawling...

01:10:21.172 --> 01:10:22.473 position:27% line:89% align:start
so long world...

01:10:22.507 --> 01:10:25.343 position:19% line:89% align:start
so long everything...

01:10:28.146 --> 01:10:30.548 position:10% line:89% align:start
Guess... Joey's signin' off.

01:10:37.221 --> 01:10:38.656 position:35% line:89% align:start
Is that...

01:10:45.163 --> 01:10:46.431 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow!

01:10:54.906 --> 01:10:56.641 position:5% line:83% align:start
(gasps)
No way!

01:11:02.312 --> 01:11:04.481 position:55% line:89% align:start
Are you okay?!

01:11:04.514 --> 01:11:08.352 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey, it's you guys!
I'm back?

01:11:08.385 --> 01:11:11.823 position:16% line:83% align:start
I am and I'm all right!
That's good.

01:11:11.856 --> 01:11:13.290 position:5% line:89% align:start
But... how?!

01:11:13.323 --> 01:11:15.827 position:5% line:83% align:start
You should be
long gone by now!

01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:17.628 position:5% line:89% align:start
You should be nothing!

01:11:17.661 --> 01:11:20.797 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'll tell ya how...
some 'a my memories...

01:11:20.831 --> 01:11:22.432 position:61% line:89% align:start
are forever!

01:11:22.466 --> 01:11:25.869 position:30% line:83% align:start
And that includes those
of my three pals here!

01:11:29.206 --> 01:11:32.175 position:13% line:83% align:start
Their friendship withstood
the power of the Plana?

01:11:32.209 --> 01:11:35.445 position:19% line:83% align:start
How is that possible?
Where did Diva go wrong?

01:11:35.479 --> 01:11:36.680 position:58% line:89% align:start
That's right!

01:11:36.713 --> 01:11:38.582 position:41% line:83% align:start
Go back to wherever
you all came from!

01:11:38.615 --> 01:11:42.786 position:21% line:83% align:start
But not you, Aigami,
not 'til you hand over Bakura!

01:11:42.819 --> 01:11:46.322 position:5% line:83% align:start
This changes nothing,
your fates are all still sealed!

01:11:46.355 --> 01:11:48.190 position:21% line:89% align:start
Including Bakura's.

01:11:48.224 --> 01:11:49.693 position:27% line:89% align:start
'Til next time.

01:11:49.726 --> 01:11:50.727 position:64% line:89% align:start
Wait, stop!

01:11:50.761 --> 01:11:52.829 position:35% line:89% align:start
(yelling)

01:11:52.863 --> 01:11:54.363 position:44% line:89% align:start
He's gone, Joey...

01:11:54.397 --> 01:11:55.565 position:47% line:83% align:start
We'll find Bakura
ourselves.

01:11:55.599 --> 01:11:57.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hope he's somewhere
we can find him!

01:11:57.734 --> 01:11:58.702 position:35% line:89% align:start
Split up!

01:11:58.735 --> 01:11:59.703 position:78% line:89% align:start
Right!

01:11:59.736 --> 01:12:00.704 position:5% line:89% align:start
Good luck!

01:12:00.737 --> 01:12:01.705 position:75% line:89% align:start
Bakura!

01:12:01.738 --> 01:12:02.672 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yugi, wait!

01:12:04.975 --> 01:12:07.911 position:5% line:89% align:start
I just...

01:12:07.944 --> 01:12:09.980 position:5% line:89% align:start
wanna say...

01:12:10.013 --> 01:12:12.515 position:5% line:83% align:start
Thank you.
That's all.

01:12:12.548 --> 01:12:14.684 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're welcome, I guess?

01:12:14.717 --> 01:12:15.951 position:35% line:89% align:start
(thunder)

01:12:19.455 --> 01:12:21.590 position:21% line:89% align:start
I don't understand.

01:12:21.624 --> 01:12:23.426 position:19% line:83% align:start
The power of the Plana
is supposed to be

01:12:23.459 --> 01:12:25.795 position:24% line:83% align:start
the greatest force
in the universe...

01:12:44.547 --> 01:12:46.949 position:5% line:83% align:start
Diva... did you really think
you could get away

01:12:46.982 --> 01:12:50.251 position:5% line:83% align:start
with stealing the last two
pieces of the Millennium Puzzle?

01:12:50.285 --> 01:12:53.756 position:16% line:83% align:start
Ha. You noticed earlier
than I thought you would.

01:12:53.789 --> 01:12:56.725 position:27% line:83% align:start
And now this...
a Deprivation Mask.

01:12:56.758 --> 01:12:59.929 position:5% line:83% align:start
Clever, now I can't communicate
with the Plana.

01:12:59.962 --> 01:13:00.996 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's right, Diva.

01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:04.833 position:5% line:83% align:start
Your team of glowy-eyed goons
can sit this one out.

01:13:04.866 --> 01:13:05.834 position:5% line:89% align:start
Take him away!

01:13:15.043 --> 01:13:17.579 position:35% line:89% align:start
(panting)

01:13:23.518 --> 01:13:27.589 position:24% line:77% align:start
My cardio stinks.
(horns honking)

01:13:34.394 --> 01:13:35.830 position:41% line:89% align:start
Kaiba?

01:13:38.032 --> 01:13:40.400 position:27% line:89% align:start
What are you doing here?

01:13:40.434 --> 01:13:41.836 position:5% line:89% align:start
Good to see you, too.

01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:44.906 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not long from now, I'll be
introducing my new Duel Disk,

01:13:44.939 --> 01:13:47.474 position:5% line:83% align:start
and to mark the occasion,
I'll be holding a tournament

01:13:47.508 --> 01:13:49.810 position:5% line:83% align:start
the likes of which has
never been seen.

01:13:49.844 --> 01:13:52.880 position:5% line:83% align:start
And you will be taking part
in this tournament, Yugi.

01:13:52.914 --> 01:13:55.649 position:38% line:83% align:start
I have bigger issues
to deal with!

01:13:58.052 --> 01:13:59.553 position:75% line:89% align:start
No way!

01:13:59.586 --> 01:14:00.854 position:33% line:89% align:start
The Millennium Puzzle?

01:14:00.888 --> 01:14:03.690 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's right.
Most of it anyway.

01:14:03.724 --> 01:14:05.092 position:5% line:83% align:start
But you can be sure
that I'll have it

01:14:05.125 --> 01:14:06.994 position:5% line:89% align:start
in its entirety soon enough.

01:14:07.027 --> 01:14:08.028 position:41% line:89% align:start
How did you get it?

01:14:08.061 --> 01:14:09.696 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's not important.

01:14:09.730 --> 01:14:11.999 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yugi... you'll come
to my tournament.

01:14:12.032 --> 01:14:15.602 position:5% line:83% align:start
And bring the puzzle piece
that you have.

01:14:15.636 --> 01:14:18.472 position:44% line:83% align:start
You know?
But how could you?

01:14:18.505 --> 01:14:21.508 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know everything
that goes on in Domino.

01:14:21.542 --> 01:14:24.745 position:41% line:83% align:start
What is it?
What are you after?

01:14:24.778 --> 01:14:27.580 position:5% line:83% align:start
The same thing
I've always been after.

01:14:27.614 --> 01:14:30.650 position:5% line:83% align:start
To show the Pharaoh...
that I'm the greatest!

01:14:30.684 --> 01:14:34.520 position:5% line:83% align:start
You will wear the puzzle again
and summon him, Yugi.

01:14:34.554 --> 01:14:36.489 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then I will duel him...

01:14:36.522 --> 01:14:38.491 position:5% line:89% align:start
and I will defeat him!

01:14:38.524 --> 01:14:40.760 position:52% line:89% align:start
But... Kaiba...

01:14:40.793 --> 01:14:42.129 position:21% line:89% align:start
(helicopter buzzing)

01:14:42.162 --> 01:14:45.966 position:5% line:83% align:start
Be honest, Yugi.
I know you want to see him too.

01:14:47.667 --> 01:14:50.070 position:35% line:83% align:start
Hey, Yugi!
Long time no see!

01:14:50.103 --> 01:14:52.438 position:16% line:89% align:start
Looking good down there!

01:14:52.471 --> 01:14:53.840 position:5% line:89% align:start
I have Diva.

01:14:55.975 --> 01:14:59.412 position:5% line:83% align:start
So long as he has the other
missing puzzle piece...

01:14:59.445 --> 01:15:01.747 position:5% line:83% align:start
he'll duel in the tournament
as well.

01:15:01.781 --> 01:15:03.549 position:5% line:83% align:start
And I'll win
those puzzle pieces

01:15:03.583 --> 01:15:07.720 position:5% line:83% align:start
from the both of you
in front of the whole world!

01:15:07.753 --> 01:15:09.922 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'll be seeing you
again soon, Yugi,

01:15:09.956 --> 01:15:13.793 position:5% line:83% align:start
and after I beat you,
I'll be seeing the Pharaoh!

01:15:16.494 --> 01:15:17.964 position:38% line:77% align:start
My box!
(horn honking)

01:15:21.433 --> 01:15:23.635 position:30% line:89% align:start
(horn honking)

01:15:25.071 --> 01:15:27.807 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yugi.

01:15:32.211 --> 01:15:35.580 position:72% line:89% align:start
But I...

01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:37.816 position:47% line:89% align:start
How'd I get here?

01:15:37.849 --> 01:15:40.119 position:47% line:83% align:start
Sera...
I have to know...

01:15:40.152 --> 01:15:43.855 position:41% line:83% align:start
why did you give me
this puzzle piece?

01:15:43.889 --> 01:15:47.792 position:5% line:83% align:start
I entrusted you with that piece
for one reason...

01:15:47.826 --> 01:15:50.929 position:5% line:83% align:start
it may be the only way
to save my brother Diva.

01:15:50.962 --> 01:15:51.963 position:61% line:89% align:start
Brother?

01:15:51.997 --> 01:15:54.532 position:5% line:83% align:start
He's giving into fear
and anger.

01:15:54.566 --> 01:15:56.501 position:5% line:89% align:start
He's losing his way.

01:15:56.534 --> 01:16:00.906 position:5% line:83% align:start
But those who are lost don't
always have to stay that way.

01:16:00.939 --> 01:16:02.974 position:5% line:89% align:start
He wasn't always like this...

01:16:03.008 --> 01:16:05.944 position:5% line:83% align:start
but our lives have been
full of challenges

01:16:05.977 --> 01:16:09.546 position:5% line:83% align:start
that could darken
even the strongest of hearts.

01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:10.815 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please, Yugi.

01:16:10.849 --> 01:16:12.683 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please save
my brother.

01:16:12.717 --> 01:16:14.585 position:5% line:89% align:start
He is all that I have.

01:16:14.618 --> 01:16:17.923 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please help him remember
who he once was.

01:16:31.635 --> 01:16:35.873 position:38% line:83% align:start
(Aigami)
Sera, where are you?

01:16:35.906 --> 01:16:38.243 position:21% line:89% align:start
Where are you, Sera?

01:16:38.276 --> 01:16:39.576 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sera?

01:16:39.610 --> 01:16:40.878 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sera?

01:16:42.913 --> 01:16:43.881 position:69% line:89% align:start
Help!

01:16:43.914 --> 01:16:47.685 position:33% line:83% align:start
Hey, what's
the big idea kid?!

01:16:47.718 --> 01:16:49.887 position:5% line:83% align:start
Little brat.
Check your wallet.

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:52.723 position:69% line:83% align:start
Sorry.
I'm here.

01:16:52.756 --> 01:16:53.991 position:30% line:89% align:start
Lousy beggars.

01:16:54.024 --> 01:16:56.827 position:19% line:83% align:start
Pretending to be poor
to get some money.

01:16:56.860 --> 01:16:59.730 position:7% line:83% align:start
Now come, we have plenty more
stops on our tour.

01:17:05.601 --> 01:17:07.503 position:58% line:89% align:start
Thanks, Sera.

01:17:07.537 --> 01:17:08.839 position:5% line:89% align:start
Of course, brother...

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:13.843 position:35% line:83% align:start
Don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.

01:17:17.613 --> 01:17:19.249 position:41% line:89% align:start
Wakey, wakey, Diva.

01:17:22.286 --> 01:17:23.686 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nice pad.

01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:25.655 position:38% line:83% align:start
You can play it cool
if ya like,

01:17:25.688 --> 01:17:27.023 position:52% line:89% align:start
but I warn you,

01:17:27.056 --> 01:17:29.926 position:19% line:83% align:start
you're on my bro's turf now
so I'd cooperate.

01:17:29.959 --> 01:17:32.528 position:33% line:83% align:start
Let's begin.
First off...

01:17:32.562 --> 01:17:35.098 position:13% line:89% align:start
we've analyzed your cube.

01:17:35.131 --> 01:17:39.068 position:16% line:83% align:start
We know there's a piece
of the Millennium Puzzle inside.

01:17:39.102 --> 01:17:42.939 position:13% line:83% align:start
But... what we don't know
is how to get it out.

01:17:42.972 --> 01:17:45.942 position:5% line:83% align:start
Of course not,
that requires true intellect.

01:17:45.975 --> 01:17:48.745 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Your brother may build</i>
 <i>a decent Duel Disk...</i>

01:17:48.778 --> 01:17:50.947 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>but when it comes</i>
 <i>to the way of the Plana,</i>

01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:52.281 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>he doesn't have the first clue.</i>

01:17:52.315 --> 01:17:55.684 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>And besides, even if you were</i>
 <i>able to extract the piece,</i>

01:17:55.717 --> 01:17:57.820 position:5% line:83% align:start
you would still require
 <i>the second one</i>

01:17:57.854 --> 01:18:00.023 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>to complete the puzzle...</i>

01:18:00.056 --> 01:18:02.624 position:5% line:83% align:start
and unfortunately for you
and your idiot brother,

01:18:02.657 --> 01:18:04.826 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm the only one
who knows where it is.

01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:06.695 position:5% line:89% align:start
So maybe it's all of you

01:18:06.728 --> 01:18:08.297 position:5% line:83% align:start
who should start cooperating
with me.

01:18:08.331 --> 01:18:11.033 position:38% line:77% align:start
(chuckles)
Looks like you don't
know everything.

01:18:11.067 --> 01:18:11.800 position:5% line:89% align:start
How's that?

01:18:11.833 --> 01:18:14.002 position:52% line:83% align:start
We're two steps
ahead of you.

01:18:14.036 --> 01:18:17.139 position:10% line:83% align:start
We know where the second piece
is and it's practically ours.

01:18:17.172 --> 01:18:18.673 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, you lie!

01:18:18.707 --> 01:18:21.710 position:38% line:83% align:start
Yeah, sometimes I do
but not now.

01:18:21.743 --> 01:18:24.613 position:44% line:83% align:start
Here... don't take
my word for it.

01:18:24.646 --> 01:18:25.881 position:58% line:89% align:start
Look at this.

01:18:25.914 --> 01:18:28.784 position:33% line:89% align:start
Sera... no.

01:18:36.625 --> 01:18:38.226 position:19% line:89% align:start
(exclaiming excitedly)

01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:40.762 position:5% line:83% align:start
Those jets
are giving me goosebumps!

01:18:40.796 --> 01:18:44.598 position:5% line:77% align:start
(Tristan)
Man, Joey, this is gonna
be the duel of Yugi's life!

01:18:44.632 --> 01:18:45.834 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hope he's ready!

01:18:45.867 --> 01:18:47.069 position:27% line:89% align:start
Of course he is!

01:18:47.102 --> 01:18:48.937 position:19% line:83% align:start
He knows this might be
the only way

01:18:48.970 --> 01:18:50.305 position:21% line:89% align:start
to get Bakura back!

01:18:52.307 --> 01:18:54.042 position:41% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

01:18:55.977 --> 01:18:57.179 position:38% line:83% align:start
Mayday!
Mayday!

01:18:58.879 --> 01:19:00.648 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, no, look out!

01:19:00.681 --> 01:19:01.982 position:50% line:83% align:start
I gotta
get out of here!

01:19:10.425 --> 01:19:13.060 position:33% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

01:19:13.094 --> 01:19:15.763 position:21% line:83% align:start
What just happened?
What's goin' on here?!

01:19:15.796 --> 01:19:17.898 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Kaiba laughing)

01:19:17.932 --> 01:19:20.134 position:30% line:83% align:start
Duelists from
around the world,

01:19:20.167 --> 01:19:22.169 position:13% line:83% align:start
what you've just witnessed
is but a taste

01:19:22.203 --> 01:19:25.606 position:13% line:83% align:start
of the technology possible
with my new Duel Disk!

01:19:28.442 --> 01:19:29.877 position:21% line:89% align:start
That was a hologram?

01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:32.246 position:19% line:83% align:start
You owe me a new pair
a' drawers, Kaiba!

01:19:32.279 --> 01:19:34.048 position:21% line:89% align:start
This is the start...

01:19:34.081 --> 01:19:36.984 position:19% line:89% align:start
of a new dueling era!

01:19:39.386 --> 01:19:42.389 position:10% line:83% align:start
An era where the only limits
that we face...

01:19:42.423 --> 01:19:46.427 position:13% line:83% align:start
will be those put in place
by our own imagination.

01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:50.331 position:7% line:83% align:start
For too long we've been forced
to live in just this reality.

01:19:50.364 --> 01:19:54.268 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's tedious, poorly designed
and pathetically constructed.

01:19:54.301 --> 01:19:58.972 position:7% line:83% align:start
If the one responsible was in
my employ, I'd have him fired.

01:19:59.005 --> 01:20:01.141 position:5% line:89% align:start
I knew that I could do better...

01:20:01.174 --> 01:20:03.810 position:16% line:83% align:start
and with just a modicum
of effort...

01:20:03.843 --> 01:20:06.312 position:27% line:83% align:start
there's no doubt
I most certainly have!

01:20:06.346 --> 01:20:09.315 position:16% line:83% align:start
The time is now to grab
the reigns of the world,

01:20:09.349 --> 01:20:13.086 position:10% line:83% align:start
and utilize my new Duel Disk
to create a future...

01:20:13.119 --> 01:20:15.955 position:24% line:83% align:start
where the ordinary
can be extraordinary,

01:20:15.989 --> 01:20:18.925 position:13% line:89% align:start
the impossible, possible!

01:20:18.958 --> 01:20:20.693 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have never settled
for mediocrity

01:20:20.727 --> 01:20:23.963 position:13% line:83% align:start
as an acceptable standard
and neither should you!

01:20:23.997 --> 01:20:26.199 position:24% line:83% align:start
And when you wield
my Duel Disk...

01:20:26.232 --> 01:20:28.034 position:13% line:83% align:start
you will find I've spared
no expense

01:20:28.067 --> 01:20:31.337 position:19% line:83% align:start
to make sure you have
pure tech perfection!

01:20:31.371 --> 01:20:34.374 position:35% line:83% align:start
So, world,
this is my gift to you!

01:20:34.407 --> 01:20:36.042 position:21% line:89% align:start
Go out and grab it!

01:20:36.075 --> 01:20:38.111 position:13% line:89% align:start
And when you do attain it,

01:20:38.144 --> 01:20:40.113 position:16% line:83% align:start
the next time you catch
yourself wondering

01:20:40.146 --> 01:20:42.482 position:16% line:83% align:start
about the great marvels
of the universe...

01:20:42.515 --> 01:20:44.484 position:16% line:89% align:start
and who's responsible...

01:20:44.517 --> 01:20:46.118 position:16% line:89% align:start
you'll have an answer...

01:20:46.151 --> 01:20:48.053 position:21% line:89% align:start
Better yet, a name.

01:20:48.086 --> 01:20:50.756 position:21% line:89% align:start
And that name is...

01:20:50.789 --> 01:20:53.326 position:30% line:89% align:start
Seto... Kaiba!

01:20:53.359 --> 01:20:55.093 position:35% line:89% align:start
(cheering)

01:21:05.437 --> 01:21:06.805 position:41% line:89% align:start
Now...

01:21:06.838 --> 01:21:08.907 position:13% line:89% align:start
on with the entertainment!

01:21:08.941 --> 01:21:11.176 position:24% line:89% align:start
Duelists, rise up!

01:21:18.450 --> 01:21:20.085 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've hand selected
these two duelists

01:21:20.118 --> 01:21:21.786 position:10% line:89% align:start
because they're the best...

01:21:21.819 --> 01:21:24.957 position:5% line:83% align:start
which means they should give me
at least a little bit of a fight

01:21:24.990 --> 01:21:27.426 position:5% line:89% align:start
before I crush them completely.

01:21:27.459 --> 01:21:28.594 position:72% line:89% align:start
Yugi...

01:21:28.627 --> 01:21:32.164 position:13% line:83% align:start
But this duel's about more
than just winning or losing.

01:21:32.197 --> 01:21:35.200 position:38% line:83% align:start
Behold!
The Millennium Puzzle!

01:21:35.234 --> 01:21:38.169 position:21% line:83% align:start
But it's incomplete,
it's missing two pieces.

01:21:38.203 --> 01:21:40.239 position:21% line:83% align:start
And those two pieces
are being held

01:21:40.272 --> 01:21:44.376 position:21% line:83% align:start
by the two duelists
you see before you.

01:21:44.409 --> 01:21:46.378 position:58% line:89% align:start
Yugi?!

01:21:46.411 --> 01:21:50.948 position:7% line:83% align:start
But they're just keeping them
warm until I take them.

01:21:50.982 --> 01:21:54.051 position:35% line:83% align:start
(Sera)
Brother, I'm sorry...

01:21:54.085 --> 01:21:58.189 position:30% line:77% align:start
But I couldn't tell you
I gave my puzzle piece
to Yugi

01:21:58.222 --> 01:22:00.992 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sera...
you're all right.

01:22:01.025 --> 01:22:03.027 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm glad but confused.

01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:05.129 position:33% line:89% align:start
I had to do something.

01:22:05.162 --> 01:22:09.333 position:30% line:83% align:start
Diva, can you not see
the error of your ways?

01:22:09.367 --> 01:22:10.434 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can see fine.

01:22:10.468 --> 01:22:15.006 position:5% line:83% align:start
It is you who turns a blind eye
to what must be done.

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:20.144 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now let's get started.
My first opponent...

01:22:20.177 --> 01:22:22.380 position:24% line:89% align:start
will be you, Diva!

01:22:27.050 --> 01:22:29.052 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait, Kaiba!

01:22:29.085 --> 01:22:31.821 position:5% line:83% align:start
I am going to duel
with Diva first!

01:22:31.855 --> 01:22:35.959 position:5% line:83% align:start
He and I have a score
to settle!

01:22:35.992 --> 01:22:37.528 position:41% line:89% align:start
We do.

01:22:37.561 --> 01:22:41.364 position:13% line:83% align:start
Uh, this is my tournament!
I call the shots!

01:22:41.398 --> 01:22:42.533 position:55% line:89% align:start
Not this time.

01:22:42.566 --> 01:22:44.467 position:47% line:83% align:start
I have a friend
who's in trouble.

01:22:44.501 --> 01:22:47.504 position:16% line:83% align:start
And beating Diva may be
the only way of helping him.

01:22:47.537 --> 01:22:49.139 position:41% line:89% align:start
You know me, Kaiba.

01:22:49.172 --> 01:22:51.341 position:24% line:83% align:start
you know I'll do anything
for a friend.

01:22:51.374 --> 01:22:52.976 position:61% line:89% align:start
So back off!

01:22:53.009 --> 01:22:56.079 position:41% line:83% align:start
Or we're gonna have
a problem!

01:22:56.112 --> 01:22:58.114 position:35% line:89% align:start
A threat?

01:22:58.148 --> 01:22:59.349 position:55% line:89% align:start
Sure, why not?

01:22:59.382 --> 01:23:01.484 position:50% line:83% align:start
Now what's it's
gonna be, Kaiba?

01:23:04.554 --> 01:23:05.588 position:64% line:89% align:start
Yeah, Yuge!

01:23:12.228 --> 01:23:13.962 position:24% line:89% align:start
Very well, then...

01:23:13.996 --> 01:23:15.565 position:10% line:89% align:start
I will grant you this favor.

01:23:15.598 --> 01:23:18.133 position:21% line:89% align:start
But just this once.

01:23:18.167 --> 01:23:19.469 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then let's go.

01:23:32.214 --> 01:23:34.316 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, well...
Yugi.

01:23:34.350 --> 01:23:36.018 position:5% line:89% align:start
It was a long time coming.

01:23:36.051 --> 01:23:38.020 position:5% line:83% align:start
But we're finally having
our duel.

01:23:38.053 --> 01:23:39.321 position:58% line:89% align:start
Listen, Diva.

01:23:39.355 --> 01:23:41.156 position:21% line:89% align:start
The piece of the puzzle...

01:23:41.190 --> 01:23:44.960 position:16% line:83% align:start
the one that your own sister
gave me is inside.

01:23:44.993 --> 01:23:47.096 position:27% line:89% align:start
She's worried about you.

01:23:47.129 --> 01:23:49.898 position:33% line:83% align:start
Can't you just release
my friend?

01:23:49.932 --> 01:23:51.300 position:5% line:89% align:start
Not happening.

01:23:56.105 --> 01:23:58.674 position:41% line:83% align:start
Very well, then you
give me no choice.

01:23:58.707 --> 01:24:01.110 position:16% line:89% align:start
We'll settle this in a duel!

01:24:01.143 --> 01:24:02.277 position:38% line:83% align:start
(Kaiba)
Yugi!

01:24:05.547 --> 01:24:07.148 position:44% line:89% align:start
The new Duel Disk?

01:24:07.182 --> 01:24:08.617 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, you'll need it.

01:24:08.650 --> 01:24:12.354 position:41% line:83% align:start
Now...
it's time for you to battle!

01:24:13.322 --> 01:24:15.391 position:50% line:83% align:start
Ready!
Then let's duel!

01:24:21.563 --> 01:24:23.431 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes... let's.

01:24:23.464 --> 01:24:27.235 position:5% line:83% align:start
But first let us go to the realm
of dimensions, Yugi!

01:24:29.604 --> 01:24:33.307 position:5% line:83% align:start
Seto!
He's dimension dueling again!

01:24:34.375 --> 01:24:36.611 position:5% line:77% align:start
What's going on?
What is this stuff?

01:24:39.213 --> 01:24:43.284 position:33% line:83% align:start
Don't get me wrong...
I like pink, but whoa!

01:24:45.253 --> 01:24:47.121 position:44% line:89% align:start
What is going on?!

01:24:49.724 --> 01:24:50.658 position:33% line:89% align:start
What the...

01:24:55.396 --> 01:24:58.499 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please, Yugi.
Please save him.

01:25:01.569 --> 01:25:03.103 position:75% line:89% align:start
Whoa.

01:25:03.136 --> 01:25:04.672 position:38% line:83% align:start
What are
all these screens?

01:25:04.705 --> 01:25:08.709 position:13% line:83% align:start
Dimension dueling, guess I'll
have to learn as I play!

01:25:08.743 --> 01:25:11.244 position:61% line:83% align:start
Here goes...
I draw!

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:14.515 position:75% line:89% align:start
Okay...

01:25:14.549 --> 01:25:17.417 position:38% line:83% align:start
I infuse my spirit
to Dimension Summon!

01:25:26.293 --> 01:25:28.328 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sentry Soldier of Stone!

01:25:36.503 --> 01:25:40.540 position:21% line:83% align:start
I place two cards facedown
and end my turn.

01:25:40.574 --> 01:25:41.708 position:5% line:89% align:start
(chuckling)

01:25:41.741 --> 01:25:45.312 position:5% line:83% align:start
I hope you're a quick study,
Yugi, because in this match...

01:25:45.345 --> 01:25:47.414 position:5% line:89% align:start
any mistake will cost you.

01:25:47.447 --> 01:25:51.183 position:5% line:89% align:start
I summon Vijam the Cubic Seed!

01:25:52.319 --> 01:25:54.053 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then I'll use Vijam...

01:25:54.086 --> 01:25:56.155 position:5% line:89% align:start
to Dimension Summon this.

01:25:56.188 --> 01:25:57.289 position:38% line:89% align:start
Take to the field...

01:25:57.323 --> 01:26:01.360 position:5% line:83% align:start
Geira Guile...
the Cubic King!

01:26:08.735 --> 01:26:12.706 position:5% line:83% align:start
By itself, Geira Guile the Cubic
King has zero attack points.

01:26:12.739 --> 01:26:17.476 position:5% line:83% align:start
But by absorbing Vijam,
it gains 800.

01:26:18.511 --> 01:26:21.447 position:27% line:83% align:start
Plus, you lose
800 life points!

01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:23.516 position:41% line:89% align:start
Whirling Windstorm!

01:26:25.217 --> 01:26:29.188 position:19% line:83% align:start
Next I play the spell!
Cubic Karma!

01:26:29.221 --> 01:26:31.557 position:21% line:83% align:start
Geira Guile absorbs
two more Vijams

01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:34.025 position:5% line:89% align:start
to gain even more attack points!

01:26:37.630 --> 01:26:40.399 position:30% line:83% align:start
Attack Yugi's
Sentry Soldier of Stone

01:26:40.432 --> 01:26:42.701 position:7% line:89% align:start
and pulverize it into rubble!

01:26:47.573 --> 01:26:51.510 position:21% line:83% align:start
And you take damage
equal to its defense points!

01:26:54.847 --> 01:26:56.347 position:75% line:89% align:start
Oh, no!

01:26:58.751 --> 01:27:02.420 position:33% line:83% align:start
You triggered my trap.
Dig of Destiny!

01:27:04.455 --> 01:27:08.293 position:19% line:83% align:start
Since I took battle damage,
I get to draw a card!

01:27:09.327 --> 01:27:12.230 position:5% line:83% align:start
Draw a million cards
if you want, Yugi.

01:27:12.263 --> 01:27:14.165 position:5% line:89% align:start
They won't help you.

01:27:14.198 --> 01:27:17.101 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not as long as I have
my Cubic Monsters.

01:27:17.135 --> 01:27:21.339 position:5% line:83% align:start
They'll keep transforming
into new and powerful forms!

01:27:21.372 --> 01:27:25.376 position:5% line:83% align:start
I Dimension Summon
another Cubic King!

01:27:25.410 --> 01:27:30.315 position:5% line:83% align:start
Observe Vulcan Dragni
the Cubic King!

01:27:33.351 --> 01:27:35.620 position:5% line:83% align:start
Say hello to Yugi,
won't you?

01:27:38.155 --> 01:27:40.257 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't think...

01:27:40.290 --> 01:27:41.826 position:5% line:89% align:start
he heard you!

01:27:41.859 --> 01:27:43.427 position:5% line:89% align:start
Attack him directly!

01:27:47.765 --> 01:27:49.600 position:38% line:89% align:start
Aaaagh!

01:27:51.435 --> 01:27:53.537 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why stop now?
Next...

01:27:53.570 --> 01:27:56.473 position:5% line:83% align:start
my Cubic King will
transform itself again.

01:27:58.408 --> 01:28:00.277 position:5% line:89% align:start
And reveal to you...

01:28:00.310 --> 01:28:01.812 position:5% line:89% align:start
its ultimate form!

01:28:01.845 --> 01:28:06.350 position:5% line:83% align:start
A form so powerful,
it's no longer a mere king,

01:28:06.383 --> 01:28:09.419 position:5% line:83% align:start
it's become something
even grander.

01:28:09.453 --> 01:28:14.324 position:5% line:83% align:start
Behold, Indiora Doom Volt
the Cubic Emperor!

01:28:21.832 --> 01:28:22.599 position:35% line:89% align:start
Not good.

01:28:22.633 --> 01:28:25.435 position:5% line:83% align:start
One more attack
and Yugi's through!

01:28:25.469 --> 01:28:27.838 position:5% line:83% align:start
Farewell,
vessel of the Pharaoh!

01:28:27.871 --> 01:28:32.476 position:5% line:83% align:start
And, Pharaoh, farewell
to any chance of your return!

01:28:35.511 --> 01:28:38.381 position:30% line:83% align:start
Wrong. I send a monster
to the graveyard

01:28:38.414 --> 01:28:40.349 position:33% line:89% align:start
to activate this trap!

01:28:40.383 --> 01:28:41.818 position:47% line:89% align:start
Silent Swordsman,

01:28:41.852 --> 01:28:44.855 position:19% line:83% align:start
cut the Emperor's
attack points down to size!

01:28:55.331 --> 01:28:59.335 position:5% line:83% align:start
You are merely delaying
your demise, Yugi!

01:28:59.368 --> 01:29:02.371 position:58% line:83% align:start
It's my turn!
I draw!

01:29:02.405 --> 01:29:03.939 position:64% line:89% align:start
Please...

01:29:03.973 --> 01:29:05.574 position:78% line:89% align:start
Yes!

01:29:05.608 --> 01:29:08.678 position:44% line:83% align:start
I Dimension Summon
a new monster!

01:29:08.711 --> 01:29:11.380 position:16% line:89% align:start
Lord Gaia the Fierce Knight!

01:29:18.521 --> 01:29:21.891 position:5% line:83% align:start
You max spirited your monster's
attack points again?

01:29:21.924 --> 01:29:23.358 position:78% line:89% align:start
Go!

01:29:23.391 --> 01:29:25.460 position:27% line:89% align:start
Lance his Cubic Emperor!

01:29:31.801 --> 01:29:35.971 position:33% line:83% align:start
Your Cubic Emperor
has been... dethroned.

01:29:36.005 --> 01:29:37.405 position:5% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

01:29:37.439 --> 01:29:39.708 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can never truly
get rid of my monsters.

01:29:42.945 --> 01:29:45.380 position:44% line:83% align:start
It split back
into three Vijams.

01:29:45.413 --> 01:29:46.648 position:5% line:89% align:start
Correct.

01:29:46.681 --> 01:29:48.850 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then by sending
Cubic Karma to my graveyard,

01:29:48.883 --> 01:29:51.619 position:5% line:83% align:start
I eliminate
half your life points!

01:29:56.491 --> 01:29:57.859 position:19% line:89% align:start
Man.

01:29:57.892 --> 01:29:59.461 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can't watch.

01:29:59.494 --> 01:30:00.628 position:33% line:89% align:start
Fight, Yugi!

01:30:00.662 --> 01:30:02.530 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ignore your friends.

01:30:02.564 --> 01:30:04.733 position:5% line:83% align:start
The sensible move
is to give up.

01:30:04.766 --> 01:30:07.702 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then I guess I don't have
a lot of sense.

01:30:09.971 --> 01:30:11.706 position:30% line:89% align:start
I will never give up...

01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:15.275 position:35% line:83% align:start
not when I have
a friend on the line!

01:30:15.309 --> 01:30:16.678 position:5% line:89% align:start
Friendship...

01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:19.914 position:5% line:83% align:start
your kind knows nothing
of friendship, just of cruelty!

01:30:19.948 --> 01:30:22.917 position:5% line:83% align:start
And that is why
you must be banished!

01:30:22.951 --> 01:30:24.819 position:5% line:83% align:start
Because taking you down
is the only way

01:30:24.853 --> 01:30:27.554 position:5% line:83% align:start
to guarantee the promise
of the Plana!

01:30:27.588 --> 01:30:33.327 position:5% line:83% align:start
The promise of a better world...
a world without hate.

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:35.562 position:5% line:83% align:start
Can you even comprehend
such a place?

01:30:35.596 --> 01:30:39.433 position:5% line:83% align:start
Where instead of using people,
you are of use to them?

01:30:39.466 --> 01:30:41.568 position:5% line:89% align:start
Maybe you can, Yugi Muto.

01:30:41.602 --> 01:30:44.004 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe you are
the exception.

01:30:44.037 --> 01:30:45.973 position:5% line:89% align:start
Maybe you should join us...

01:30:46.006 --> 01:30:49.843 position:5% line:83% align:start
and together we can remake this
world into one without hate,

01:30:49.877 --> 01:30:53.013 position:5% line:83% align:start
where no one has to live
a single moment of fear,

01:30:53.046 --> 01:30:56.049 position:5% line:89% align:start
a world of our own design.

01:30:58.085 --> 01:31:01.054 position:38% line:89% align:start
I'll never join you.

01:31:01.088 --> 01:31:02.723 position:35% line:89% align:start
You say that we hate.

01:31:02.756 --> 01:31:05.058 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, from what I've seen,
that's all that fuels you.

01:31:05.092 --> 01:31:09.830 position:21% line:83% align:start
So there's no way you can
create a world without it.

01:31:14.367 --> 01:31:15.769 position:41% line:89% align:start
Diva.

01:31:18.105 --> 01:31:21.875 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't know what you're
talking about, Yugi!

01:31:21.909 --> 01:31:24.377 position:7% line:83% align:start
You don't know
what I've gone through.

01:31:24.410 --> 01:31:25.878 position:5% line:89% align:start
What I've seen.

01:31:25.912 --> 01:31:30.050 position:5% line:83% align:start
But perhaps you'll understand
once I show you...

01:31:35.388 --> 01:31:37.757 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm so tired, Diva.

01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:40.760 position:30% line:83% align:start
I know, Sera,
it's been a long day.

01:31:44.063 --> 01:31:47.033 position:30% line:77% align:start
(pounds table)
You must take me for a fool!

01:31:47.066 --> 01:31:50.803 position:19% line:83% align:start
Out all day and this is
all you say you've earned?!

01:31:51.771 --> 01:31:54.607 position:50% line:83% align:start
No food for you!
Or anyone!

01:31:56.576 --> 01:31:57.810 position:66% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

01:31:57.844 --> 01:31:59.679 position:41% line:83% align:start
It's my fault we're
not eating tonight.

01:31:59.712 --> 01:32:02.148 position:5% line:83% align:start
No... you know
that's not true.

01:32:02.181 --> 01:32:04.382 position:7% line:83% align:start
No matter how much money
we bring back,

01:32:04.416 --> 01:32:07.053 position:5% line:89% align:start
it's never good enough.

01:32:07.086 --> 01:32:08.420 position:52% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

01:32:08.453 --> 01:32:11.790 position:5% line:83% align:start
But... if you're
hungry, hug a pillow.

01:32:11.823 --> 01:32:14.526 position:5% line:83% align:start
It almost feels
like you just had a big meal!

01:32:14.559 --> 01:32:15.694 position:16% line:89% align:start
Here...

01:32:17.696 --> 01:32:19.431 position:41% line:89% align:start
I prefer ice cream.

01:32:19.464 --> 01:32:20.932 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:32:20.966 --> 01:32:22.701 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughter)

01:32:32.444 --> 01:32:33.912 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughter)

01:32:33.945 --> 01:32:35.580 position:83% line:89% align:start
Hey!

01:32:36.615 --> 01:32:38.817 position:47% line:89% align:start
What's so funny?!

01:32:38.850 --> 01:32:40.719 position:47% line:83% align:start
Oh, now you're
not laughing, eh?

01:32:40.752 --> 01:32:42.621 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's what I thought!

01:32:44.189 --> 01:32:47.559 position:41% line:83% align:start
Fear not, children.
I come in peace.

01:32:47.592 --> 01:32:49.861 position:41% line:83% align:start
And I bring with me
wonderful news.

01:32:51.730 --> 01:32:56.067 position:58% line:83% align:start
You...
are all free.

01:32:56.101 --> 01:32:58.069 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why you...

01:32:58.103 --> 01:33:00.071 position:5% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

01:33:00.105 --> 01:33:01.739 position:5% line:89% align:start
Why can't... I move?!

01:33:01.772 --> 01:33:05.809 position:24% line:83% align:start
Those who have had
the most wretched lives...

01:33:05.843 --> 01:33:08.846 position:10% line:89% align:start
deserve the most beautiful.

01:33:08.879 --> 01:33:12.650 position:16% line:83% align:start
Together we will create
that beauty.

01:33:18.022 --> 01:33:19.456 position:27% line:89% align:start
Diva!

01:33:19.490 --> 01:33:21.792 position:35% line:89% align:start
Your brother is fine.

01:33:21.825 --> 01:33:23.894 position:41% line:89% align:start
As you all will be.

01:33:30.935 --> 01:33:32.770 position:16% line:89% align:start
(straining)

01:33:36.073 --> 01:33:40.610 position:5% line:83% align:start
People like you...
are why I am here.

01:33:40.644 --> 01:33:42.746 position:5% line:89% align:start
You will harm no one else.

01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:44.081 position:64% line:89% align:start
Except you!

01:33:46.183 --> 01:33:47.217 position:64% line:89% align:start
You'll pay!

01:33:53.290 --> 01:33:55.658 position:30% line:89% align:start
Master Shin...

01:33:55.692 --> 01:33:59.196 position:27% line:83% align:start
he saved us all,
and it won't be for nothing!

01:33:59.229 --> 01:34:02.765 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll do whatever it takes
for the Plana to survive!

01:34:02.799 --> 01:34:05.034 position:7% line:89% align:start
And no one's going to stop me!

01:34:05.068 --> 01:34:06.769 position:69% line:89% align:start
No, Diva.

01:34:06.803 --> 01:34:11.674 position:5% line:83% align:start
Serve me again, Indiora Doom
Volt the Cubic Emperor!

01:34:17.013 --> 01:34:18.614 position:35% line:89% align:start
(coughing)

01:34:18.648 --> 01:34:20.817 position:38% line:83% align:start
You may have gotten
your Indiora back...

01:34:20.850 --> 01:34:24.687 position:38% line:83% align:start
but its return also
powers up Lord Gaia!

01:34:24.721 --> 01:34:27.223 position:35% line:89% align:start
(roaring)

01:34:29.292 --> 01:34:30.960 position:44% line:89% align:start
Rah!

01:34:30.994 --> 01:34:36.065 position:5% line:83% align:start
You know nothing of power!
I play the spell Cubic Wave!

01:34:36.099 --> 01:34:38.600 position:5% line:83% align:start
While my monster's
attack points are doubled,

01:34:38.633 --> 01:34:40.569 position:5% line:89% align:start
yours are cut in half!

01:34:40.602 --> 01:34:42.671 position:16% line:89% align:start
Aw, man.

01:34:42.704 --> 01:34:44.307 position:41% line:89% align:start
Fight!

01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:46.109 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're finished, Yugi!

01:34:46.142 --> 01:34:47.043 position:5% line:89% align:start
And with your defeat,

01:34:47.076 --> 01:34:50.812 position:5% line:83% align:start
so is Kaiba's plan
to resurrect the Pharaoh!

01:34:50.846 --> 01:34:53.815 position:5% line:83% align:start
And I will never lose
the power of the Plana!

01:34:53.849 --> 01:34:57.286 position:5% line:83% align:start
Cubic Emperor,
attack and erase the vessel!

01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:59.821 position:47% line:77% align:start
I don't think so.
What?

01:34:59.855 --> 01:35:03.058 position:38% line:83% align:start
We're not through...
not at all.

01:35:03.091 --> 01:35:03.692 position:78% line:89% align:start
Go!

01:35:03.725 --> 01:35:06.862 position:21% line:89% align:start
The Trap Dimension Sphinx!

01:35:06.895 --> 01:35:08.630 position:19% line:89% align:start
Since your monster has

01:35:08.663 --> 01:35:11.700 position:10% line:83% align:start
over twice the attack points
of mine,

01:35:11.733 --> 01:35:14.136 position:16% line:83% align:start
the difference is dealt
to you as damage!

01:35:22.110 --> 01:35:25.247 position:5% line:83% align:start
But... so what?!
My attack still ends you!

01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:28.884 position:52% line:83% align:start
Not when I play
my second trap!

01:35:28.917 --> 01:35:30.785 position:41% line:89% align:start
Dimension Guardian!

01:35:30.819 --> 01:35:33.889 position:35% line:83% align:start
It keeps Gaia
from being destroyed!

01:35:33.922 --> 01:35:36.124 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you through?!

01:35:36.158 --> 01:35:37.259 position:72% line:89% align:start
Not yet!

01:35:37.292 --> 01:35:41.729 position:38% line:83% align:start
'Cause now I play...
my third trap card!

01:35:41.762 --> 01:35:43.731 position:5% line:89% align:start
A third trap?

01:35:43.764 --> 01:35:46.067 position:47% line:89% align:start
Dimension Mirage!

01:35:46.100 --> 01:35:48.135 position:33% line:83% align:start
Since you failed
to destroy my monster,

01:35:48.170 --> 01:35:51.239 position:33% line:83% align:start
your monster is forced
to attack again!

01:35:51.273 --> 01:35:53.308 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, no...

01:35:53.341 --> 01:35:55.743 position:5% line:89% align:start
That would mean...

01:35:55.776 --> 01:35:57.244 position:5% line:89% align:start
you trapped me!

01:35:57.278 --> 01:35:58.979 position:58% line:89% align:start
That's right.

01:35:59.013 --> 01:36:02.883 position:19% line:83% align:start
Indiora is caught
in a perpetual attack loop!

01:36:02.917 --> 01:36:05.619 position:30% line:83% align:start
Which, thanks
to my three trap cards,

01:36:05.653 --> 01:36:09.623 position:10% line:83% align:start
will result in you losing life
points with every attack!

01:36:09.657 --> 01:36:11.358 position:33% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

01:36:14.228 --> 01:36:17.098 position:41% line:83% align:start
And with no way
to escape my combo,

01:36:17.131 --> 01:36:18.833 position:24% line:89% align:start
you know what that means.

01:36:18.866 --> 01:36:22.002 position:38% line:83% align:start
This duel between us
is all but over.

01:36:22.036 --> 01:36:25.039 position:33% line:83% align:start
Diva, I know you fight
for a cause

01:36:25.072 --> 01:36:27.841 position:38% line:83% align:start
and that you believe
it's a noble one...

01:36:27.874 --> 01:36:31.245 position:27% line:83% align:start
but when you fight using
hate to achieve peace...

01:36:31.278 --> 01:36:32.979 position:38% line:89% align:start
you've already lost.

01:36:36.117 --> 01:36:39.420 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now for the sake of Bakura
and for us all...

01:36:39.453 --> 01:36:41.855 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm ending this!

01:37:00.039 --> 01:37:01.407 position:30% line:89% align:start
Master Shin...

01:37:07.247 --> 01:37:09.282 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yugi just won...

01:37:09.315 --> 01:37:11.951 position:35% line:89% align:start
(cheering)

01:37:24.330 --> 01:37:26.232 position:35% line:89% align:start
Master...

01:37:26.266 --> 01:37:27.300 position:27% line:89% align:start
I've failed you.

01:37:33.306 --> 01:37:35.908 position:24% line:89% align:start
The puzzle piece.

01:37:35.941 --> 01:37:37.410 position:66% line:89% align:start
Diva lost.

01:37:37.443 --> 01:37:38.977 position:5% line:83% align:start
The Pharaoh
will resurrect.

01:37:39.011 --> 01:37:40.746 position:5% line:83% align:start
What will
become of us?

01:37:40.779 --> 01:37:42.347 position:21% line:89% align:start
Stay calm everyone.

01:37:42.381 --> 01:37:46.718 position:19% line:83% align:start
The fate of our future
is for Yugi to decide.

01:37:46.752 --> 01:37:49.955 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, man.
That was a close one, huh?

01:37:54.026 --> 01:37:57.196 position:41% line:83% align:start
Okay, so Yugi won,
but where's Bakura?

01:37:57.229 --> 01:37:57.963 position:75% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

01:37:57.996 --> 01:38:00.999 position:5% line:77% align:start
What is that?
What's that light?

01:38:01.033 --> 01:38:03.302 position:33% line:89% align:start
Is it him?!

01:38:03.335 --> 01:38:05.736 position:35% line:83% align:start
'Scuse me!
Comin' through, guys!

01:38:05.770 --> 01:38:08.373 position:35% line:89% align:start
Pardon me!

01:38:08.407 --> 01:38:12.144 position:61% line:83% align:start
Bakura!
You're okay!

01:38:12.177 --> 01:38:14.379 position:21% line:89% align:start
Whoa... where am I?

01:38:14.413 --> 01:38:15.980 position:58% line:89% align:start
With friends!

01:38:16.013 --> 01:38:18.217 position:41% line:83% align:start
Yuge!
We got him!

01:38:18.250 --> 01:38:19.384 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ya did it!

01:38:19.418 --> 01:38:20.818 position:5% line:89% align:start
He's back!

01:38:20.851 --> 01:38:24.789 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yugi... the two puzzle pieces...

01:38:24.822 --> 01:38:27.191 position:33% line:83% align:start
you now have
them both, yes?

01:38:29.994 --> 01:38:31.162 position:61% line:89% align:start
So, Kaiba...

01:38:31.195 --> 01:38:33.798 position:38% line:83% align:start
once again it's down
to you and me...

01:38:33.831 --> 01:38:35.199 position:38% line:89% align:start
just like old times.

01:38:35.233 --> 01:38:38.436 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, you aren't the one
that I want to duel, Yugi.

01:38:38.469 --> 01:38:39.870 position:5% line:89% align:start
I want the Pharaoh.

01:38:39.904 --> 01:38:41.872 position:5% line:83% align:start
You will complete
the Millennium Puzzle

01:38:41.906 --> 01:38:43.341 position:5% line:83% align:start
and release
the Pharaoh's spirit,

01:38:43.374 --> 01:38:45.776 position:5% line:83% align:start
bringing him back
into your body.

01:38:45.810 --> 01:38:47.211 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is not a request.

01:38:47.245 --> 01:38:49.447 position:5% line:83% align:start
This matter is not up
for debate.

01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:50.448 position:38% line:89% align:start
Listen to me, Kaiba.

01:38:50.481 --> 01:38:53.284 position:27% line:83% align:start
I understand how badly
you want to battle Atem.

01:38:53.317 --> 01:38:56.120 position:41% line:83% align:start
I do.
More than you know.

01:38:56.153 --> 01:38:57.989 position:38% line:89% align:start
But the reality is--

01:38:58.022 --> 01:38:59.423 position:5% line:89% align:start
No more words!

01:38:59.457 --> 01:39:02.460 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yugi... if you won't
release him willingly,

01:39:02.493 --> 01:39:04.195 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll just have to force you!

01:39:04.228 --> 01:39:07.498 position:5% line:83% align:start
And Pharaoh, if you can hear me,
prepare to be crushed!

01:39:16.239 --> 01:39:17.541 position:5% line:77% align:start
Let's do this!
Let's do this!

01:39:20.944 --> 01:39:22.846 position:5% line:89% align:start
Make your move, Yugi.

01:39:22.879 --> 01:39:25.482 position:41% line:83% align:start
Very well, Kaiba...
I draw!

01:39:25.516 --> 01:39:30.020 position:35% line:83% align:start
I summon Marshmacaron
in defense mode!

01:39:30.053 --> 01:39:34.024 position:35% line:83% align:start
Then I'll end my turn
with two facedowns.

01:39:34.057 --> 01:39:35.825 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is that all?

01:39:35.859 --> 01:39:38.828 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fine then, it's my turn!

01:39:38.862 --> 01:39:41.965 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fly in, Assault Wyvern!

01:39:41.998 --> 01:39:45.001 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now, slice and dice that blob!

01:39:49.005 --> 01:39:50.607 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's much appreciated,
Kaiba...

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:54.277 position:5% line:83% align:start
'Cause you've just created
double the trouble for yourself!

01:39:56.011 --> 01:39:57.846 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then let's give this a try...

01:39:57.880 --> 01:39:59.516 position:5% line:83% align:start
Assault Wyvern's ability
allows me

01:39:59.549 --> 01:40:03.420 position:5% line:83% align:start
to summon the legendary
Blue-Eyes White Dragon!

01:40:08.358 --> 01:40:11.260 position:5% line:83% align:start
Next I play Dragon's
Fighting Spirit!

01:40:11.293 --> 01:40:13.862 position:5% line:83% align:start
My Blue-Eyes gains
an additional attack...

01:40:13.896 --> 01:40:17.567 position:5% line:83% align:start
for every monster
that you have out on the field!

01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:22.171 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now go, Blue Eyes,
Triple White Lightning Attack!

01:40:29.912 --> 01:40:32.648 position:27% line:89% align:start
I activate Dark Horizon!

01:40:32.681 --> 01:40:34.283 position:27% line:89% align:start
I may have taken damage,

01:40:34.316 --> 01:40:37.885 position:24% line:83% align:start
but that has allowed me
to summon my dear friend,

01:40:37.919 --> 01:40:40.289 position:55% line:89% align:start
Dark Magician!

01:40:40.322 --> 01:40:42.990 position:5% line:83% align:start
I look forward
to destroying him.

01:40:43.024 --> 01:40:46.595 position:5% line:83% align:start
When I'm ready.
It's your move, Yugi.

01:40:46.628 --> 01:40:48.497 position:66% line:89% align:start
Here goes!

01:40:48.530 --> 01:40:51.099 position:75% line:89% align:start
I draw!

01:40:51.132 --> 01:40:52.568 position:61% line:89% align:start
With this...

01:40:52.601 --> 01:40:54.436 position:55% line:89% align:start
I end my turn.

01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:56.505 position:5% line:89% align:start
A single facedown?

01:40:56.538 --> 01:40:59.974 position:5% line:83% align:start
Why, Yugi, it's like
you're not even trying anymore.

01:41:00.007 --> 01:41:02.444 position:5% line:89% align:start
Blue-Eyes, attack!

01:41:02.478 --> 01:41:05.947 position:41% line:83% align:start
Now!
I activate my trap!

01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:08.282 position:47% line:89% align:start
Metamorphortress!

01:41:10.451 --> 01:41:14.489 position:21% line:83% align:start
Can't get to me now, Kaiba
Not with your Blue-Eyes.

01:41:19.494 --> 01:41:21.129 position:5% line:89% align:start
Lucky move.

01:41:21.162 --> 01:41:23.131 position:72% line:89% align:start
My turn!

01:41:23.164 --> 01:41:25.299 position:50% line:83% align:start
It's my Castle's
turn to show...

01:41:25.333 --> 01:41:27.101 position:47% line:89% align:start
it packs a punch!

01:41:40.248 --> 01:41:43.451 position:5% line:83% align:start
Heh. You think you've taken
things to the next level.

01:41:43.484 --> 01:41:44.419 position:5% line:89% align:start
Very well.

01:41:44.452 --> 01:41:47.622 position:5% line:83% align:start
You've given me no choice
but to ritual summon

01:41:47.655 --> 01:41:51.124 position:5% line:83% align:start
and take things
to the maximum level!

01:41:51.158 --> 01:41:53.994 position:5% line:83% align:start
You said I couldn't get
to you with Blue-Eyes.

01:41:54.027 --> 01:41:56.430 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, I can with this!

01:41:56.463 --> 01:42:00.333 position:5% line:89% align:start
Blue-Eyes Chaos Max Dragon!

01:42:07.174 --> 01:42:10.076 position:5% line:83% align:start
What was it the Pharaoh
used to say?

01:42:10.110 --> 01:42:13.146 position:5% line:83% align:start
Playtime is over?
Well, soon it will be!

01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:14.381 position:5% line:89% align:start
Attack!!!

01:42:17.417 --> 01:42:21.254 position:5% line:83% align:start
When Chaos Max Dragon destroys
a monster in defense mode,

01:42:21.288 --> 01:42:25.125 position:5% line:83% align:start
you still take damage,
double the damage!

01:42:25.158 --> 01:42:28.228 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now, how's that
for storming the castle?

01:42:29.729 --> 01:42:31.465 position:66% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

01:42:33.232 --> 01:42:36.403 position:38% line:83% align:start
You haven't defeated
me yet, Kaiba,

01:42:36.436 --> 01:42:39.038 position:41% line:83% align:start
because like Atem
always taught me...

01:42:39.071 --> 01:42:43.209 position:24% line:83% align:start
I duel to the end!
And it's not the end yet!

01:42:43.242 --> 01:42:47.012 position:38% line:83% align:start
I summon
Apple Magician Girl!

01:42:47.046 --> 01:42:49.649 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

01:42:49.683 --> 01:42:51.217 position:61% line:89% align:start
All right...

01:42:51.250 --> 01:42:53.085 position:52% line:83% align:start
if your monster
is so tough...

01:42:53.118 --> 01:42:55.488 position:27% line:83% align:start
then let's see
if it can take her down!

01:42:55.521 --> 01:42:59.091 position:5% line:83% align:start
You fight me with fruit?
Don't mock me!

01:42:59.124 --> 01:43:02.695 position:5% line:83% align:start
Chaos Max Dragon,
pulverize her!

01:43:02.728 --> 01:43:05.464 position:21% line:83% align:start
Thanks, because when Apple
Magician Girl is attacked,

01:43:05.498 --> 01:43:07.166 position:13% line:89% align:start
she can bring out her friend!

01:43:07.199 --> 01:43:08.434 position:30% line:89% align:start
And this friend's bound

01:43:08.467 --> 01:43:10.803 position:35% line:83% align:start
to leave a sour taste
in your mouth.

01:43:10.836 --> 01:43:13.272 position:21% line:89% align:start
She's Lemon Magician Girl!

01:43:13.305 --> 01:43:16.675 position:27% line:83% align:start
And your dragon's attack
is diverted to her!

01:43:16.709 --> 01:43:17.743 position:41% line:89% align:start
But that's not all,

01:43:17.776 --> 01:43:20.178 position:30% line:83% align:start
she cuts the strength
of your attack in half!

01:43:20.212 --> 01:43:22.348 position:41% line:83% align:start
Try making lemonade
out of that!

01:43:25.216 --> 01:43:26.452 position:58% line:89% align:start
There's more.

01:43:26.485 --> 01:43:27.786 position:24% line:89% align:start
Like Apple Magician Girl,

01:43:27.820 --> 01:43:31.189 position:24% line:83% align:start
Lemon Magician Girl
also calls up her friend!

01:43:31.222 --> 01:43:34.292 position:41% line:83% align:start
The one-and-only
Dark Magician Girl!

01:43:34.325 --> 01:43:37.395 position:19% line:83% align:start
Zap away Chaos Max Dragon's
attack points!

01:43:41.634 --> 01:43:43.268 position:35% line:89% align:start
(gasping)

01:43:52.644 --> 01:43:55.747 position:5% line:83% align:start
You really hate dragons,
don't you?

01:43:55.780 --> 01:43:58.483 position:5% line:83% align:start
But no matter
how many dragons you destroy,

01:43:58.516 --> 01:44:01.319 position:5% line:89% align:start
they'll never go extinct!

01:44:01.352 --> 01:44:03.187 position:5% line:89% align:start
Watch as the Relentless arrives

01:44:03.221 --> 01:44:07.659 position:5% line:83% align:start
from the far reaches of light
and space seeking vengeance!

01:44:13.331 --> 01:44:16.099 position:5% line:83% align:start
Witness Deep-Eyes
White Dragon!

01:44:16.133 --> 01:44:20.772 position:5% line:83% align:start
Deep-Eyes inflicts damage for
every dragon in my graveyard.

01:44:20.805 --> 01:44:22.707 position:5% line:89% align:start
Feel their wrath!

01:44:25.810 --> 01:44:27.779 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm not done, Yugi.

01:44:27.812 --> 01:44:31.548 position:5% line:83% align:start
Deep-Eyes gets Chaos Max
Dragon's attack points!

01:44:33.450 --> 01:44:36.821 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't think even the Pharaoh
can save you anymore!

01:44:36.854 --> 01:44:37.688 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're finished!

01:44:40.757 --> 01:44:44.561 position:41% line:83% align:start
I play my trap...
Magician's Defense!

01:44:45.829 --> 01:44:48.732 position:38% line:89% align:start
The damage I take...

01:44:48.765 --> 01:44:50.300 position:52% line:89% align:start
is cut in half!

01:44:56.873 --> 01:44:58.775 position:5% line:89% align:start
Your move.

01:45:00.410 --> 01:45:03.547 position:5% line:83% align:start
Playing that trap card
saved him, still...

01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:06.883 position:10% line:83% align:start
if Yugi doesn't do something
this turn, he's finished!

01:45:13.255 --> 01:45:16.793 position:38% line:83% align:start
This is it, Kaiba.
It's all or nothing.

01:45:16.827 --> 01:45:19.362 position:41% line:83% align:start
First I have
to give you a card.

01:45:19.395 --> 01:45:21.765 position:55% line:83% align:start
So here...
take this one!

01:45:26.569 --> 01:45:32.174 position:5% line:83% align:start
By doing so, I can activate
the Spell Magical Contract Door.

01:45:32.208 --> 01:45:34.443 position:27% line:83% align:start
It lets me draw
a new monster...

01:45:34.477 --> 01:45:35.912 position:16% line:89% align:start
and I'll summon it now!

01:45:39.649 --> 01:45:42.284 position:33% line:83% align:start
Break free
from your iron prison!

01:45:42.318 --> 01:45:46.689 position:38% line:83% align:start
Gandora-X the Dragon
of Demolition!

01:45:54.530 --> 01:45:57.466 position:41% line:83% align:start
Gandora-X's ability
activates!

01:45:57.500 --> 01:46:00.335 position:30% line:83% align:start
It destroys any monster
that I choose...

01:46:00.368 --> 01:46:02.638 position:30% line:89% align:start
and I choose Deep-Eyes!

01:46:05.473 --> 01:46:06.809 position:35% line:89% align:start
(yelling)

01:46:06.842 --> 01:46:10.311 position:24% line:83% align:start
And you take damage equal
to its attack points!

01:46:10.345 --> 01:46:14.315 position:7% line:83% align:start
Then Gandora-X gains the attack
points of Deep-Eyes.

01:46:14.349 --> 01:46:16.685 position:16% line:89% align:start
No!

01:46:16.719 --> 01:46:17.619 position:13% line:89% align:start
No!

01:46:17.652 --> 01:46:21.623 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not if Deep Eyes
takes Gandora down with it!

01:46:33.268 --> 01:46:34.669 position:5% line:89% align:start
Do you see now?

01:46:34.703 --> 01:46:38.673 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nothing will get in the way
of me resurrecting the Pharaoh!

01:46:38.707 --> 01:46:40.508 position:50% line:83% align:start
But what if it's
not up to you?

01:46:40.542 --> 01:46:43.411 position:30% line:89% align:start
Or me, for that matter.

01:46:43.445 --> 01:46:44.946 position:19% line:89% align:start
I tried to tell you, Kaiba,

01:46:44.979 --> 01:46:47.682 position:33% line:83% align:start
but maybe I need
to show you instead...

01:46:50.785 --> 01:46:52.687 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yugi...

01:47:21.815 --> 01:47:22.983 position:35% line:89% align:start
The ring?

01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:28.555 position:33% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

01:47:30.424 --> 01:47:34.762 position:30% line:83% align:start
Help me, Sera!
Help me!

01:47:36.063 --> 01:47:38.899 position:33% line:89% align:start
Master Shin!

01:47:40.868 --> 01:47:43.904 position:5% line:83% align:start
The Pharaoh...
he has not returned.

01:47:43.937 --> 01:47:48.809 position:47% line:83% align:start
He's gone, Kaiba.
Gone forever.

01:47:48.842 --> 01:47:52.846 position:7% line:83% align:start
I've known it deep down in
my heart since we said goodbye.

01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:55.548 position:47% line:83% align:start
He's no longer
inside the puzzle

01:47:55.581 --> 01:47:57.350 position:44% line:83% align:start
because we've gone
our separate ways.

01:47:57.383 --> 01:48:02.522 position:7% line:83% align:start
It wasn't easy, it still isn't,
but I had to let him go.

01:48:02.555 --> 01:48:05.825 position:27% line:89% align:start
And you have to as well.

01:48:05.858 --> 01:48:08.661 position:66% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

01:48:08.694 --> 01:48:11.998 position:24% line:83% align:start
But this was what destiny
chose for us.

01:48:16.836 --> 01:48:19.505 position:5% line:89% align:start
You lie.

01:48:19.539 --> 01:48:20.840 position:5% line:89% align:start
He's just afraid!

01:48:20.873 --> 01:48:23.342 position:5% line:83% align:start
Scared to come out
and face me!

01:48:23.376 --> 01:48:25.711 position:5% line:83% align:start
He knows he's no match
for me...

01:48:25.745 --> 01:48:28.381 position:5% line:83% align:start
But it's not going to work,
I'll beat him out of you!

01:48:28.414 --> 01:48:32.552 position:5% line:83% align:start
This trap lets me discard
a spell card to activate it.

01:48:32.585 --> 01:48:34.020 position:50% line:89% align:start
Kaiba, wait, no!

01:48:34.053 --> 01:48:36.622 position:5% line:89% align:start
And the spell I'll activate...

01:48:36.656 --> 01:48:38.558 position:5% line:83% align:start
is the one
you foolishly gave me!

01:48:38.591 --> 01:48:41.928 position:5% line:89% align:start
Monster Reborn!

01:48:41.961 --> 01:48:46.766 position:5% line:83% align:start
Return from the great beyond,
Deep-Eyes White Dragon!

01:48:46.799 --> 01:48:50.602 position:10% line:89% align:start
This is it, Yugi, it's over!

01:48:53.839 --> 01:48:56.575 position:33% line:89% align:start
I activate the trap...

01:48:56.608 --> 01:48:57.944 position:64% line:89% align:start
Final Geas!

01:48:57.977 --> 01:49:01.746 position:16% line:83% align:start
All the monsters in both
our graveyards are banished.

01:49:04.183 --> 01:49:07.853 position:21% line:83% align:start
But I'm allowed
to bring one of them back!

01:49:11.957 --> 01:49:14.392 position:5% line:89% align:start
Him.

01:49:14.426 --> 01:49:16.928 position:55% line:89% align:start
Are you ready?

01:49:16.962 --> 01:49:19.831 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm always ready.

01:49:21.099 --> 01:49:22.734 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

01:49:22.767 --> 01:49:25.103 position:44% line:89% align:start
Go, Dark Magician!

01:49:25.136 --> 01:49:27.105 position:44% line:89% align:start
Dark Magic Attack!

01:49:37.548 --> 01:49:39.150 position:41% line:89% align:start
Kaiba!

01:49:39.184 --> 01:49:40.751 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckles)

01:49:47.092 --> 01:49:48.960 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Aigami chuckling)

01:49:48.994 --> 01:49:50.095 position:38% line:89% align:start
(clangs)

01:49:50.128 --> 01:49:51.729 position:83% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:49:51.762 --> 01:49:52.830 position:33% line:89% align:start
(both gasp)

01:49:52.863 --> 01:49:55.833 position:41% line:89% align:start
That's Diva's cube.

01:49:55.866 --> 01:49:58.502 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Aigami laughing)

01:49:58.535 --> 01:50:00.404 position:5% line:83% align:start
(Yugi)
The Millennium Ring.

01:50:01.972 --> 01:50:04.675 position:58% line:83% align:start
What is this?
Aah!

01:50:04.708 --> 01:50:05.676 position:27% line:89% align:start
(crowd gasping)

01:50:05.709 --> 01:50:06.877 position:5% line:77% align:start
Whoa.
Not good.

01:50:09.146 --> 01:50:10.781 position:27% line:89% align:start
(girl whimpers)

01:50:10.814 --> 01:50:12.783 position:41% line:83% align:start
(Sera)
Diva, is that you?!

01:50:12.816 --> 01:50:15.451 position:21% line:83% align:start
(Aigami, distorted)
Yes, it's me, dear sister.

01:50:15.486 --> 01:50:16.452 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm back.

01:50:16.486 --> 01:50:18.589 position:19% line:89% align:start
And better than ever!

01:50:18.622 --> 01:50:20.157 position:50% line:89% align:start
Better or worse?

01:50:24.929 --> 01:50:26.230 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

01:50:26.263 --> 01:50:28.065 position:27% line:89% align:start
(people gasping)

01:50:28.098 --> 01:50:29.732 position:27% line:89% align:start
(man screaming)

01:50:29.767 --> 01:50:33.636 position:38% line:83% align:start
(Mokuba)
W-what's happening to them?

01:50:33.670 --> 01:50:35.638 position:24% line:83% align:start
And what's coming
out of that cube?!

01:50:35.672 --> 01:50:39.209 position:16% line:89% align:start
(groaning and growling)

01:50:51.154 --> 01:50:52.722 position:5% line:83% align:start
(Yugi)
Diva?

01:50:52.755 --> 01:50:55.191 position:41% line:83% align:start
(Kaiba)
He's looked better.

01:50:58.194 --> 01:50:59.762 position:41% line:89% align:start
Diva!

01:50:59.796 --> 01:51:00.763 position:5% line:83% align:start
(growls)
(gasps)

01:51:00.797 --> 01:51:03.066 position:13% line:89% align:start
Diva, what are you doing?

01:51:03.099 --> 01:51:06.903 position:5% line:83% align:start
Diva?
Diva is no longer in control.

01:51:06.936 --> 01:51:08.071 position:5% line:89% align:start
I am.

01:51:08.104 --> 01:51:11.174 position:5% line:83% align:start
His fear invited me
into his soul.

01:51:11.207 --> 01:51:12.842 position:27% line:89% align:start
He has saved me!

01:51:12.875 --> 01:51:15.712 position:7% line:83% align:start
And by bonding the Millennium
Ring's dark energies

01:51:15.745 --> 01:51:16.879 position:27% line:89% align:start
with his Cube...

01:51:16.913 --> 01:51:19.916 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm stronger
than anyone ever before!

01:51:19.949 --> 01:51:22.684 position:5% line:89% align:start
and now, at long last, sister...

01:51:22.718 --> 01:51:25.620 position:24% line:83% align:start
I will bring forth
a perfect new world!

01:51:25.654 --> 01:51:28.992 position:5% line:89% align:start
The one we've been dreaming of!

01:51:29.025 --> 01:51:29.993 position:41% line:89% align:start
No...

01:51:30.026 --> 01:51:31.526 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:32.995 position:21% line:89% align:start
When used correctly,

01:51:33.029 --> 01:51:34.997 position:21% line:83% align:start
the Plana can create
a world of beauty,

01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:36.565 position:13% line:89% align:start
full of peace and harmony.

01:51:36.598 --> 01:51:39.935 position:13% line:83% align:start
But if even a single drop
of evil mixes in--

01:51:39.968 --> 01:51:42.738 position:16% line:83% align:start
It will remake the world
into a dimension of darkness!

01:51:42.771 --> 01:51:45.007 position:7% line:89% align:start
Such is the power of the Cube!

01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:48.944 position:24% line:83% align:start
Such is the power
of the eighth Millennium Item!

01:51:48.977 --> 01:51:51.980 position:16% line:89% align:start
(screaming and shouting)

01:51:52.014 --> 01:51:53.215 position:41% line:83% align:start
(Sera)
This isn't what we wanted.

01:51:53.248 --> 01:51:56.885 position:35% line:83% align:start
This isn't
what the Plana is for!

01:51:56.918 --> 01:51:59.287 position:19% line:83% align:start
Please... you have to
fight this, dear brother,

01:51:59.321 --> 01:52:02.556 position:21% line:83% align:start
for these poor souls
and for Master Shin!

01:52:02.590 --> 01:52:04.893 position:10% line:89% align:start
Shin is my master no longer!

01:52:04.926 --> 01:52:06.294 position:5% line:89% align:start
That is why I did away with him.

01:52:06.328 --> 01:52:09.563 position:24% line:83% align:start
As I will do away
with anyone who opposes me!

01:52:09.597 --> 01:52:12.234 position:10% line:89% align:start
Including you, dear sister!

02:02:33.743 --> 02:02:37.380 position:27% line:83% align:start
But the Pharaoh
did return... so...

02:02:37.413 --> 02:02:40.850 position:5% line:89% align:start
Our powers are gone.

02:02:40.883 --> 02:02:42.317 position:78% line:89% align:start
Manny.

02:02:42.350 --> 02:02:44.352 position:41% line:89% align:start
Diva.

02:02:44.386 --> 02:02:46.722 position:16% line:89% align:start
But it is for the best.

02:02:50.225 --> 02:02:52.962 position:41% line:77% align:start
(Joey)
Yugi... you actually
saw the Pharaoh?

02:02:52.995 --> 02:02:56.331 position:27% line:83% align:start
Mm-hmm. Yeah, and it was
great seeing him again.

02:02:56.364 --> 02:02:57.632 position:27% line:89% align:start
How's he doing?

02:02:57.666 --> 02:02:58.500 position:80% line:89% align:start
Good.

02:02:58.533 --> 02:02:59.668 position:5% line:83% align:start
(Joey)
So, like, be honest.

02:02:59.701 --> 02:03:01.937 position:5% line:83% align:start
He asked all about me,
didn't he?

02:03:01.971 --> 02:03:03.873 position:80% line:77% align:start
Oh...
Please!

02:03:03.906 --> 02:03:05.206 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sure he did.

02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:06.341 position:24% line:89% align:start
He wished us well.

02:03:06.374 --> 02:03:08.677 position:38% line:83% align:start
(Kaiba)
I said he'd be back.

02:03:08.710 --> 02:03:13.281 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hate to say I told you so
but... told you so.

02:03:13.314 --> 02:03:14.582 position:5% line:89% align:start
You were right.

02:03:14.616 --> 02:03:16.918 position:5% line:83% align:start
I thought the Pharaoh
would never return.

02:03:16.951 --> 02:03:19.454 position:5% line:89% align:start
But you never stopped believing.

02:03:19.487 --> 02:03:23.425 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hmm. You have your bond
with him...

02:03:23.458 --> 02:03:26.294 position:50% line:89% align:start
and I have mine.

02:03:26.327 --> 02:03:27.762 position:44% line:89% align:start
Take care, Yugi...

02:03:27.796 --> 02:03:30.932 position:35% line:83% align:start
until our paths cross
once again.

02:03:30.965 --> 02:03:33.868 position:58% line:89% align:start
See ya later!

02:03:33.902 --> 02:03:36.571 position:27% line:89% align:start
Till next time.

02:03:36.604 --> 02:03:40.507 position:35% line:83% align:start
Goodbye...
and thank you!
