1
00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:48,012
Ha ha ha!

2
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,514
Ha ha ha!

3
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:55,078
Mayday! Mayday!

4
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:07,169
Pirates!

5
00:02:20,588 --> 00:02:21,635
Hold them off!

6
00:02:21,964 --> 00:02:24,519
Sheeta, stay out of the way and you won't get hurt.

7
00:02:49,457 --> 00:02:50,457
Aah!

8
00:02:54,397 --> 00:02:55,542
Come on!

9
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,895
Hurry up! Break the door down!

10
00:03:10,502 --> 00:03:11,312
Aah!

11
00:03:11,661 --> 00:03:13,100
Yeah! Oof!

12
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:17,852
Where is she?

13
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:20,552
No!

14
00:03:20,577 --> 00:03:23,158
Hey, I found her! She's hiding out here!

15
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:25,249
Don't let her escape! Quick, get her!

16
00:03:25,718 --> 00:03:28,101
Whoa, Ma! Don't let me go!

17
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:29,649
Quit your whining! I got you!

18
00:03:29,968 --> 00:03:31,572
Aah! She's wearing the crystal!

19
00:03:31,597 --> 00:03:32,984
Now, go get her!

20
00:03:33,008 --> 00:03:33,519
Right!

21
00:03:33,636 --> 00:03:35,610
I want that crystal!

22
00:03:41,643 --> 00:03:43,690
Aaah!

23
00:03:43,768 --> 00:03:47,478
Oh, no! There goes my crystal!

24
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,653
Oh, no!

25
00:06:26,828 --> 00:06:28,577
I need some meatballs for the boss, please.

26
00:06:28,602 --> 00:06:31,119
All right. You're sure working late tonight, Pazu.

27
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:33,585
Things are finally busy for a change.

28
00:06:33,646 --> 00:06:34,742
Still working?

29
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:36,083
Yep. Bye!

30
00:06:40,804 --> 00:06:41,351
Huh?

31
00:06:46,747 --> 00:06:47,930
What is that?

32
00:06:55,685 --> 00:06:57,281
Looks like a body! Whoa!

33
00:07:00,315 --> 00:07:01,134
Whoa!

34
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:04,367
Aah! Whoa! Whoa!

35
00:07:10,827 --> 00:07:12,249
Yaah!

36
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:21,298
Huh?

37
00:07:30,732 --> 00:07:31,777
Aah!

38
00:07:50,323 --> 00:07:51,799
Pazu!

39
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:54,248
What are you doing up there?

40
00:07:54,421 --> 00:07:55,573
Did you bring my dinner?

41
00:07:55,636 --> 00:07:56,989
Yeah, I did!

42
00:07:57,014 --> 00:07:59,538
But this girl came down from the sky!

43
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:06,325
Ohh...

44
00:08:06,428 --> 00:08:07,849
Blast these old pipes!

45
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,528
Aah! Whoa.

46
00:08:10,272 --> 00:08:11,368
Uh, here you go.

47
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:12,933
Boss!

48
00:08:13,421 --> 00:08:16,239
Come on! Come on!

49
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,613
Listen, Boss! A girl came...

50
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,799
What? Not again!

51
00:08:25,893 --> 00:08:27,275
Just when I get one thing fixed...

52
00:08:27,315 --> 00:08:29,326
Listen to me! A girl came down...

53
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:31,430
Tighten the second valve, will you?

54
00:08:31,515 --> 00:08:33,039
There's no time to lose!

55
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:35,821
Ah, this machinery's too old!

56
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,831
I think I need a bigger wrench!

57
00:08:44,114 --> 00:08:44,848
I'll get it!

58
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:50,386
Go run the hoist while I fix this!

59
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:51,013
Huh?

60
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:54,438
You think you can do it? - Yeah! Here!

61
00:08:55,255 --> 00:08:57,534
Just stay calm and use your head!

62
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,004
Right.

63
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:16,473
Hit the brake!

64
00:09:16,684 --> 00:09:17,305
What?

65
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:27,395
Whew.

66
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:29,865
Well, how'd it go, boys?

67
00:09:29,984 --> 00:09:32,589
No silver, not even any trace of tin.

68
00:09:33,026 --> 00:09:34,942
We're just not having any luck.

69
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:37,814
Maybe we would if we tried
digging the mines just east of here.

70
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,175
I don't know. Those mines are worse than this one.

71
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,281
We just have to start all over again.

72
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:45,006
Let's call it a day. Good night.

73
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,143
'Night.

74
00:09:57,648 --> 00:10:01,468
Shut off the boiler, Pazu. We're
not gonna find anything today.

75
00:10:02,016 --> 00:10:05,386
If things keep going like
this. we'll all be starving soon.

76
00:10:06,848 --> 00:10:09,788
And, Pazu, maybe you can oil that blasted machine!

77
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:10,481
OK!

78
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:12,370
Thanks. Good night.

79
00:10:12,643 --> 00:10:13,300
'Night!

80
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,714
Mom, it's no use. Let's call it off.
There's too much cloud cover. It's too dark!

81
00:10:29,843 --> 00:10:30,856
What?!

82
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:33,084
Mom, don't worry. I'll find her!

83
00:10:33,109 --> 00:10:34,307
We'll all find her!

84
00:13:08,383 --> 00:13:09,439
Ohh!

85
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:13,903
Hello!

86
00:13:15,153 --> 00:13:16,762
It's about time you got up!

87
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:22,476
How are you feeling?

88
00:13:25,914 --> 00:13:29,030
Hi, there! My name's Pazu. I'm really
glad to see you're doing all right.

89
00:13:29,055 --> 00:13:30,295
You had me worried there.

90
00:13:31,793 --> 00:13:33,017
Go ahead. Feed them.

91
00:13:33,205 --> 00:13:33,891
Don't be shy.

92
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:34,772
Aah!

93
00:13:36,934 --> 00:13:38,962
These guys are really happy we have a visitor.

94
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,510
Well, thank goodness.

95
00:13:43,585 --> 00:13:45,197
You laugh like a regular person.

96
00:13:45,586 --> 00:13:47,127
The way you fell from the sky...

97
00:13:47,271 --> 00:13:49,042
I thought that maybe you were an angel or something.

98
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,043
Thank you very much for saving me.

99
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,316
Oh, I'm sorry. My name's Sheeta.

100
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:55,522
Sheeta... what a beautiful name.

101
00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:58,131
I had to catch you. You were just floating.

102
00:13:58,258 --> 00:13:59,450
What? Floating?

103
00:13:59,475 --> 00:13:59,895
Yeah.

104
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:02,223
Well, I remember an airship...

105
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:04,932
but I can't remember anything else.

106
00:14:05,003 --> 00:14:06,314
That's all you remember?

107
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,723
Mm-hmm. I'm not sure how I survived.

108
00:14:09,772 --> 00:14:10,302
Hmm.

109
00:14:10,955 --> 00:14:13,267
Well, I think I might have an idea about that.

110
00:14:13,704 --> 00:14:15,079
May I see your necklace for a second?

111
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:16,929
This?

112
00:14:19,554 --> 00:14:21,283
My grandmother gave it to me.

113
00:14:21,363 --> 00:14:23,750
It's been in my family for generations.

114
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:25,671
Wow, it's beautiful.

115
00:14:26,063 --> 00:14:27,116
Could you hold this?

116
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:34,560
Oh.

117
00:14:36,411 --> 00:14:37,477
Thanks. Heh.

118
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:40,133
Get a load of this! Watch!

119
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:42,214
Here I go-o-o!

120
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:48,100
Pazu! Are you all right?

121
00:14:56,603 --> 00:14:57,221
Unh!

122
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:04,834
Ha! Well, so maybe I had the
wrong idea about this necklace.

123
00:15:04,953 --> 00:15:05,847
Aah!

124
00:15:07,627 --> 00:15:08,365
Oh!

125
00:15:21,794 --> 00:15:22,534
Aah! Aah!

126
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,830
Whoa!

127
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,588
I'm so sorry, Pazu.

128
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,763
Ohh.

129
00:15:31,535 --> 00:15:32,741
Are you OK?

130
00:15:33,092 --> 00:15:33,989
I'm fine.

131
00:15:34,014 --> 00:15:36,237
Oh, you scared me. Does it hurt much?

132
00:15:36,262 --> 00:15:39,939
Are you kidding? If my head were any
harder you could use it as a cannonball.

133
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,469
Whoa! The kettle! It must be boiling over!

134
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:49,489
Come on! Let's go! Follow me! This way!

135
00:15:49,545 --> 00:15:50,013
OK.

136
00:15:50,111 --> 00:15:52,500
I'll get breakfast started. You can wash up over there.

137
00:15:54,303 --> 00:15:55,648
There's a clean towel, too.

138
00:15:55,716 --> 00:15:57,075
Great. Thank you.

139
00:16:15,636 --> 00:16:16,478
"Laputa."

140
00:16:20,602 --> 00:16:24,153
Sheeta! It's time for breakfast!

141
00:16:33,254 --> 00:16:35,070
My father took that picture from an airship.

142
00:16:35,256 --> 00:16:36,467
He loved to fly.

143
00:16:36,802 --> 00:16:38,882
It's Laputa the floating island.

144
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:41,037
An island that floats in the sky?

145
00:16:41,062 --> 00:16:44,269
Yep. Most people think it's just a
legend but my dad actually saw it.

146
00:16:45,715 --> 00:16:47,336
That's a picture of his airship.

147
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,178
It looked like a castle just floating there in the sky.

148
00:17:09,557 --> 00:17:12,411
He said it was the most amazing thing he'd ever seen.

149
00:17:23,707 --> 00:17:25,811
And that's the only picture he was able to take.

150
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:28,059
But take a look at this, Sheeta.

151
00:17:28,249 --> 00:17:31,705
Dad kept a journal, and he made all
sorts of drawings of Laputa, see?

152
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:36,227
There it is. He drew the castle and
also what he thought the people'd look like.

153
00:17:37,164 --> 00:17:40,858
He was sure the castle was filled
with treasure but nobody believed him.

154
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,407
They called him a liar.

155
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,992
Being called a liar is what killed him.

156
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,857
But I am gonna prove that my dad was no liar, Sheeta.

157
00:17:55,214 --> 00:17:57,123
As soon as I'm done building this plane...

158
00:17:57,282 --> 00:17:59,609
I'm gonna take off and find Laputa myself.

159
00:18:07,293 --> 00:18:08,531
Hmm.

160
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:10,448
Ohh!

161
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,266
It's a real automobile! You
don't see many of those around here!

162
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,741
Those people are pirates Pazu.

163
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:15,292
What?

164
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:18,049
They're the ones who attacked the airship.

165
00:18:18,812 --> 00:18:21,053
They're probably after you. Come on!

166
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,689
Good morning! Good-bye!

167
00:18:29,784 --> 00:18:31,596
Hold it! Wait up!

168
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:33,653
Yes? How can I help you, mister?

169
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:35,139
Young man, query...

170
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:36,910
Have you seen a little girl around here?

171
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:37,911
Let me see now.

172
00:18:37,998 --> 00:18:40,398
There are about 100 girls in this town. Which one?

173
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:42,337
Thanks for nothing, kid!

174
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:43,178
Bye!

175
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,477
They are definitely after you, Sheeta.

176
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,956
Louie, go tell your mother! She's in disguise!

177
00:18:51,012 --> 00:18:53,523
So, she's in disguise! Go tell my mother!

178
00:19:01,554 --> 00:19:02,759
Haven't seen her.

179
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:06,171
That's what you keep saying but I
want you think really hard about it.

180
00:19:06,407 --> 00:19:07,338
Boss!

181
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:08,905
Boss!

182
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:13,442
She'd be about the age of those two.

183
00:19:13,533 --> 00:19:15,569
Aah! Oh, no!

184
00:19:17,368 --> 00:19:19,885
There she is! Don't let her get away!

185
00:19:20,155 --> 00:19:21,181
Now!

186
00:19:21,287 --> 00:19:22,618
Yeow!

187
00:19:23,594 --> 00:19:26,073
Hey, boss, they're pirates! They're after her!

188
00:19:29,597 --> 00:19:31,684
Pirates? I want to see!

189
00:19:33,427 --> 00:19:35,828
You can stop right there, my friend.

190
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:38,085
Think you're tough, don't you?

191
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,007
I'm tough enough.

192
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:40,236
We'll see about that.

193
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:43,083
Just go away. We're honest folks here.

194
00:19:43,775 --> 00:19:44,808
What did you do that for?

195
00:19:45,006 --> 00:19:46,246
Quick, leave from the back.

196
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:47,350
No, I'm gonna fight 'em!

197
00:19:47,722 --> 00:19:49,731
Pazu, what if you wind up getting yourself hurt?

198
00:19:49,793 --> 00:19:50,471
So?!

199
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:53,648
So, somebody's got to protect your friend.

200
00:19:53,673 --> 00:19:56,708
Hmm? Oh. Mm-hmm.

201
00:19:56,866 --> 00:19:58,743
Why don't you get out of our way?

202
00:19:58,768 --> 00:20:00,666
Why don't you just try and make me?

203
00:20:00,754 --> 00:20:01,866
Maybe I will!

204
00:20:01,891 --> 00:20:02,519
Oh, yeah!

205
00:20:03,454 --> 00:20:05,199
Make your shirt explode.

206
00:20:17,178 --> 00:20:19,554
Hey, Boss, show him what you're made of!

207
00:20:25,652 --> 00:20:26,810
Ha ha ha!

208
00:20:27,452 --> 00:20:28,820
Mm-hmm.

209
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:33,842
I'm not mending that, I hope you know.

210
00:20:35,758 --> 00:20:37,078
Take that, you landlubber!

211
00:20:45,283 --> 00:20:46,531
Come on, Shalulu!

212
00:20:46,674 --> 00:20:48,081
Give him something for nothing!

213
00:20:48,676 --> 00:20:49,930
Ooh!

214
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:51,519
You go get him, boss!

215
00:20:51,657 --> 00:20:52,681
Unh!

216
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:55,318
He said Mom was ugly, now go get him!

217
00:20:55,548 --> 00:20:55,875
Oh!

218
00:20:55,941 --> 00:20:56,683
Raah!

219
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:57,861
That's it! Get him!

220
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,697
That's it!

221
00:20:58,770 --> 00:20:59,642
Punch him!

222
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:01,189
Come on, you got it!

223
00:21:01,397 --> 00:21:02,217
Yeah! Yeah!

224
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:04,066
Hey, loudmouth!

225
00:21:05,073 --> 00:21:06,101
No Unh!

226
00:21:06,537 --> 00:21:09,366
Get in there! Give him a right, a left!

227
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,192
Whoa! Oh...

228
00:21:29,838 --> 00:21:31,611
They're headed for the railroad tracks.

229
00:21:31,685 --> 00:21:32,905
Let's move it!

230
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,818
Hey! Hey!

231
00:21:40,223 --> 00:21:40,628
Hey!

232
00:21:40,714 --> 00:21:42,559
We're gonna jump on, Sheeta!

233
00:21:42,591 --> 00:21:43,783
Right! Unh!

234
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,712
That's it!

235
00:21:46,086 --> 00:21:46,719
Come on!

236
00:21:46,743 --> 00:21:47,286
Unh!

237
00:21:48,699 --> 00:21:51,052
Hey, Pazu, who's your friend there?

238
00:21:51,146 --> 00:21:54,308
Her name is Sheeta! Pirates are after us!

239
00:21:56,143 --> 00:21:57,356
It's the Dola gang!

240
00:21:57,381 --> 00:21:58,615
I'll be Pirates?

241
00:21:58,774 --> 00:22:00,725
Can you drop us at the police station in the next town?

242
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,503
Sure. Help me stoke up the engine!

243
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,303
Will do!

244
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,559
Hey, it's Mom!

245
00:22:14,362 --> 00:22:17,547
You chowder-heads! Get your brother and hop on!

246
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,106
But Sheeta's hiding inside that house.

247
00:22:20,136 --> 00:22:22,902
Lame-brain! They made an escape. Now, step on it!

248
00:22:22,995 --> 00:22:23,905
They escaped?

249
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:24,968
I want to come!

250
00:22:24,993 --> 00:22:25,803
Mommy!

251
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:33,773
Unh! Hey!

252
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,121
Well...

253
00:22:53,452 --> 00:22:55,605
Hey, Pazu, here they come!

254
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:58,910
Can't this engine go any faster?

255
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,721
This is the best she'll do! She's old!

256
00:23:04,201 --> 00:23:06,530
Floor it! Move over!

257
00:23:15,084 --> 00:23:17,325
I'd really prefer to be in the car, Mother!

258
00:23:31,705 --> 00:23:34,661
Increase the steam! They're gaining on us!

259
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:37,186
We got 'em!

260
00:23:37,211 --> 00:23:38,173
Yaah!

261
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,024
We need you in here!

262
00:23:42,794 --> 00:23:43,850
Help with the fire!

263
00:23:43,874 --> 00:23:44,719
OK!

264
00:23:50,034 --> 00:23:50,836
Aah!

265
00:23:52,217 --> 00:23:53,259
Yaah!

266
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:55,381
Uh-oh!

267
00:23:55,876 --> 00:23:57,829
Unh! Charge!

268
00:23:57,915 --> 00:23:58,690
Look out!

269
00:23:58,856 --> 00:23:59,302
Aah!

270
00:24:03,937 --> 00:24:06,662
Come on! Get 'em! Get 'em!

271
00:24:17,851 --> 00:24:19,788
Hey, come back here!

272
00:24:24,317 --> 00:24:27,108
You'll get yours! Don't just stand there!

273
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,649
Push this train over the cliff!

274
00:24:28,752 --> 00:24:29,315
What?

275
00:24:29,855 --> 00:24:31,641
Ha ha ha!

276
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,597
We sure showed them!

277
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:34,571
I can do it now.

278
00:24:34,595 --> 00:24:35,934
You were amazing!

279
00:24:38,739 --> 00:24:41,219
Heave! Heave!

280
00:24:41,243 --> 00:24:42,175
And heave...

281
00:24:42,242 --> 00:24:42,857
Wait.

282
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:43,432
And stop.

283
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,743
You think maybe it's Muska?

284
00:24:49,768 --> 00:24:52,960
Yeah it's Muska, all right. We gotta find those kids.

285
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:01,579
Huh?

286
00:25:07,275 --> 00:25:10,762
Well, What do you know about
that? It's the army to the rescue!

287
00:25:16,325 --> 00:25:19,781
Hey! Could you kindly help these two young people?

288
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,074
Pirates have been chasing them all day!

289
00:25:30,973 --> 00:25:33,080
Huh? What's the matter?

290
00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:35,146
Good-bye, Pazu!

291
00:25:35,281 --> 00:25:37,035
Young lady, come back here!

292
00:25:37,131 --> 00:25:37,652
Unh!

293
00:25:37,676 --> 00:25:39,022
Oh!

294
00:25:40,078 --> 00:25:41,670
Sheeta, wait!

295
00:25:42,184 --> 00:25:44,146
Halt, or I'll shoot!

296
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,052
Aah! - Ow!

297
00:25:49,217 --> 00:25:50,672
It's an armored train, Mother!

298
00:25:50,697 --> 00:25:53,044
And we're the Dola gang! Attack!

299
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,864
No! Hey! Sheeta!

300
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,215
Don't follow me! You'll get hurt!

301
00:25:58,411 --> 00:26:00,171
Aah!

302
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:05,634
Whoa!

303
00:26:16,503 --> 00:26:18,920
Aah!

304
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:20,828
Don't let go!

305
00:26:27,784 --> 00:26:29,075
Come on!

306
00:26:40,085 --> 00:26:40,962
Where are they, Mother?

307
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,494
Be quiet! Just watch them.

308
00:26:55,287 --> 00:26:56,064
Ohh!

309
00:27:00,682 --> 00:27:02,451
Ahh!

310
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:05,085
Huh?

311
00:27:07,045 --> 00:27:07,864
Oh!

312
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,254
Sheeta, we're floating!

313
00:27:12,701 --> 00:27:13,607
You see?

314
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,728
This was what happened the first time I saw you.

315
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:18,318
See that? It's the power of the crystal.

316
00:27:20,616 --> 00:27:21,330
I knew it!

317
00:27:21,355 --> 00:27:23,659
I knew there was something special about your necklace!

318
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:24,410
Oh!

319
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,787
Whoo!

320
00:27:40,454 --> 00:27:42,558
The necklace will let us down nice and easy.

321
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:51,474
Boys, I want that crystal!

322
00:27:51,523 --> 00:27:52,562
Fire!

323
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:03,583
It's fantastic! Incredible!

324
00:28:03,686 --> 00:28:05,830
I must have that crystal!

325
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:26,749
It's going out!

326
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:28,808
Ah, wait. Just a minute.

327
00:28:37,477 --> 00:28:39,961
I guess your necklace must come to
life whenever you're in trouble.

328
00:28:42,281 --> 00:28:43,957
Wow, that's a long way up.

329
00:28:45,054 --> 00:28:49,018
I hope they're all right your boss
and his wife and that nice train engineer.

330
00:28:49,152 --> 00:28:50,415
My friends are all miners.

331
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,173
They can take care of themselves. I
wouldn't worry about them if I were you.

332
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:54,633
Come on, Sheeta. Let's go.

333
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:59,564
This has been a mining town
as long as anyone can remember.

334
00:28:59,718 --> 00:29:02,128
Most of these tunnels aren't even used anymore.

335
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:15,506
Here you go.

336
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:19,026
Thank you. I'm glad you brought some food.

337
00:29:19,145 --> 00:29:20,319
I'm starving.

338
00:29:20,423 --> 00:29:22,721
And for dessert, I've got a green apple and some candy.

339
00:29:22,792 --> 00:29:26,447
Really? You know that bag of yours must be magic.

340
00:29:26,594 --> 00:29:28,512
It's always got just what we need.

341
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:33,717
Ha!

342
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,062
Mmm!

343
00:29:42,454 --> 00:29:44,791
Sheeta, where exactly do you come from?

344
00:29:45,388 --> 00:29:48,770
I come from Gondoa deep in the northern mountains.

345
00:29:49,027 --> 00:29:52,569
I used to live there with my
parents and we were very happy.

346
00:29:54,205 --> 00:29:56,025
But when my mother and father died...

347
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,733
I was all alone.

348
00:29:59,529 --> 00:30:01,366
The only thing that kept me going...

349
00:30:01,391 --> 00:30:04,384
was the farm and taking care of my animals.

350
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:07,864
But one day. everything changed.

351
00:30:08,386 --> 00:30:11,510
That was the day the men came and took me away.

352
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,446
Whoa, wait a minute. They kidnapped you?

353
00:30:17,501 --> 00:30:18,216
Yes.

354
00:30:18,305 --> 00:30:20,495
It was that man in the dark glasses.

355
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,415
I wonder who that guy is...

356
00:30:22,449 --> 00:30:24,047
and what he's doing with the army.

357
00:30:25,469 --> 00:30:28,567
I think Dola and that man are both after your necklace.

358
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:30,799
I think you're right, but I had no idea...

359
00:30:30,824 --> 00:30:33,167
my crystal was so incredibly powerful.

360
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:37,432
It's been in my family as long as I can remember.

361
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,713
Mother gave it to me before she died...

362
00:30:40,151 --> 00:30:43,328
and she told me never to show
it or give it away to anyone.

363
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,330
Huh.

364
00:30:46,693 --> 00:30:49,093
We orphans should stick together, don't you think?

365
00:30:49,242 --> 00:30:50,454
I'm really sorry.

366
00:30:50,534 --> 00:30:53,117
It's my fault getting you mixed up in all this.

367
00:30:53,413 --> 00:30:54,332
Are you kidding?

368
00:30:54,357 --> 00:30:56,532
This is the most exciting
thing that's ever happened to me.

369
00:30:56,691 --> 00:30:59,322
I wouldn't miss an adventure like this for the world!

370
00:31:04,501 --> 00:31:05,137
What?

371
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:16,491
Are you some sort of goblin come to torment me?

372
00:31:16,816 --> 00:31:19,224
It's Uncle Pom! Don't worry. He's a friend.

373
00:31:19,438 --> 00:31:23,181
Uncle Pom, boy, am I glad to see you!

374
00:31:23,224 --> 00:31:25,454
I can't see you clearly yet, goblin...

375
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:27,162
but you sound like Pazu.

376
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,973
And if these old eyes don't deceive me...

377
00:31:29,998 --> 00:31:31,666
there's a she-goblin with you.

378
00:31:31,746 --> 00:31:33,668
There are pirates chasing us, Uncle Pom.

379
00:31:33,811 --> 00:31:34,442
Oh?

380
00:31:34,466 --> 00:31:36,146
The army's right behind them.

381
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:40,427
Ha ha ha! That sounds absolutely splendid!

382
00:31:51,332 --> 00:31:53,237
The tea is ready. Help yourself.

383
00:31:53,262 --> 00:31:54,840
Thank you. This is great.

384
00:31:55,488 --> 00:31:58,344
Don't you get lonely down here underground, Uncle Pom?

385
00:32:00,082 --> 00:32:01,450
Never, my dear.

386
00:32:01,532 --> 00:32:03,596
All of these rocks are my friends.

387
00:32:03,683 --> 00:32:05,137
They often talk to me.

388
00:32:05,272 --> 00:32:08,657
Ever since last night, they've been especially restless.

389
00:32:08,879 --> 00:32:11,390
The rocks talk to you? - Oh, yes, Pazu.

390
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,392
The earth speaks to all of us...

391
00:32:13,743 --> 00:32:16,569
and if we listen. we can understand.

392
00:32:21,576 --> 00:32:24,505
The rocks speak in a very small voice.

393
00:32:36,116 --> 00:32:39,642
Huh? Oh, my!

394
00:32:44,609 --> 00:32:45,467
Whoa!

395
00:32:57,971 --> 00:32:58,909
Amazing!

396
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:01,682
Pazu, look above us!

397
00:33:01,707 --> 00:33:02,003
Huh?

398
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:03,369
Wow!

399
00:33:13,815 --> 00:33:15,959
It was just a hunk of rock a while ago.

400
00:33:16,256 --> 00:33:17,785
Oh, my!

401
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:21,146
The answer lies inside these rocks.

402
00:33:21,561 --> 00:33:22,521
Let me show you.

403
00:33:30,939 --> 00:33:32,409
Pazu, you see?

404
00:33:32,472 --> 00:33:35,868
All the rocks around here contain a bit of aetherium.

405
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:37,336
Really?

406
00:33:39,689 --> 00:33:42,743
Mankind once knew how to mine aetherium...

407
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,972
but no longer.

408
00:33:46,794 --> 00:33:47,586
Wait!

409
00:33:49,748 --> 00:33:51,716
Look, my stone's glowing!

410
00:33:53,036 --> 00:33:55,095
Well, goodness! Bless my soul!

411
00:33:55,436 --> 00:33:57,452
That's a pure aetherium crystal!

412
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:01,554
There hasn't been one since
before my great-grandfather's time.

413
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:06,281
No wonder the rocks were restless.

414
00:34:06,393 --> 00:34:09,053
This stone possesses incredible power.

415
00:34:09,904 --> 00:34:14,164
Legend has it that only the people
of the floating city of Laputa...

416
00:34:14,189 --> 00:34:15,857
knew how to make such crystals.

417
00:34:15,882 --> 00:34:17,372
They made this crystal?

418
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:21,759
They used aetherium to make Laputa float in the sky.

419
00:34:21,823 --> 00:34:23,647
I knew Laputa wasn't just made up!

420
00:34:23,723 --> 00:34:25,936
You see, Sheeta? It's just like my dad said!

421
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,104
What's the matter?

422
00:34:33,627 --> 00:34:36,632
I'm sorry, but would you put that crystal away?

423
00:34:36,703 --> 00:34:38,513
It's too strong for me.

424
00:34:39,057 --> 00:34:40,108
Oh, sorry.

425
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:42,899
What is it, Uncle Pom?

426
00:34:53,561 --> 00:34:58,189
Great-grandpa used to tell me the rocks become restless...

427
00:34:58,237 --> 00:35:00,743
when Laputa appears over the mine.

428
00:35:01,475 --> 00:35:04,415
Wow! So that must mean
Laputa's over the mine right now!

429
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,681
Listen! Sheeta, now I can prove that the legend is true!

430
00:35:08,387 --> 00:35:10,850
Sheeta, I must tell you something.

431
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:11,826
Yes?

432
00:35:12,515 --> 00:35:13,495
What is it?

433
00:35:14,949 --> 00:35:17,842
That crystal is extremely powerful...

434
00:35:18,397 --> 00:35:23,095
but with a power that rightfully
belongs to the earth from which it came.

435
00:35:23,362 --> 00:35:29,784
To forget that, and then to try to use the crystal's
power for selfish reasons will bring great unhappiness.

436
00:35:29,956 --> 00:35:30,909
You understand?

437
00:35:30,933 --> 00:35:31,524
Yes.

438
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:35,607
Your crystal should remind us
that we come from the earth...

439
00:35:35,862 --> 00:35:38,507
and to the earth we must return.

440
00:35:39,746 --> 00:35:41,259
Come on, lighten up!

441
00:35:41,378 --> 00:35:44,565
Two times already, that crystal's gotten
Sheeta out of some really big trouble.

442
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:45,974
And I have a feeling...

443
00:35:46,266 --> 00:35:48,309
that crystal's gonna help us find Laputa.

444
00:35:57,216 --> 00:35:58,353
It's flying away!

445
00:35:58,378 --> 00:36:00,424
Mom, can we go back to the ship now, please?

446
00:36:00,793 --> 00:36:01,880
It's too quiet.

447
00:36:02,171 --> 00:36:04,191
We better just stay put for the time being.

448
00:36:06,543 --> 00:36:08,538
Does this mean no lunch?

449
00:36:09,752 --> 00:36:11,563
The coast is clear. Let's go.

450
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,209
Uncle Pom, thank you.

451
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,957
Be careful, my dear.

452
00:36:35,255 --> 00:36:37,235
Wow, look up there!

453
00:36:53,633 --> 00:36:57,964
Beyond that cloud is a floating city
that no one here on earth believes exists.

454
00:37:00,537 --> 00:37:03,527
But I swear I am going to be the one to prove it!

455
00:37:03,578 --> 00:37:04,349
Pazu?

456
00:37:04,603 --> 00:37:05,186
Huh?

457
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:08,276
Listen, there's something I haven't told you yet.

458
00:37:09,286 --> 00:37:12,385
You see my family has a very old traditional name...

459
00:37:12,638 --> 00:37:15,006
and when the stone was passed on to me...

460
00:37:15,152 --> 00:37:16,728
I inherited that name.

461
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:22,307
And the name I inherited was Lusheeta Toel Ul Laputa.

462
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,469
Laputa? You mean you're...

463
00:37:30,363 --> 00:37:32,260
They found us, Sheeta! Let's go!

464
00:37:36,942 --> 00:37:37,972
Head back to the mine!

465
00:37:37,996 --> 00:37:38,785
Stop them!

466
00:37:39,459 --> 00:37:40,339
Unh!

467
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,549
Aah!

468
00:37:41,855 --> 00:37:42,613
Hands up!

469
00:37:43,017 --> 00:37:44,290
Don't you touch her!

470
00:37:47,118 --> 00:37:49,379
Let me go!

471
00:37:49,404 --> 00:37:49,804
Aah!

472
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:51,862
Oh, no! Are you all right, Pazu?

473
00:37:51,901 --> 00:37:53,639
You have to wake up, Pazu!

474
00:37:55,134 --> 00:37:56,682
Sir, we've captured them.

475
00:37:56,706 --> 00:37:58,035
And about time.

476
00:38:22,347 --> 00:38:24,117
Ohh!

477
00:38:25,689 --> 00:38:26,254
Huh?

478
00:38:31,857 --> 00:38:34,455
Huh? Hey, let me out!

479
00:38:34,686 --> 00:38:35,471
Unh!

480
00:38:36,668 --> 00:38:37,385
Unh!

481
00:38:39,973 --> 00:38:40,848
Where am I?

482
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:45,109
Unh!

483
00:38:45,545 --> 00:38:47,276
Forward, march!

484
00:39:01,634 --> 00:39:02,931
Aah!

485
00:39:18,675 --> 00:39:19,860
We're wasting time!

486
00:39:20,247 --> 00:39:23,408
You twist an arm or two, and
I guarantee the girl will talk.

487
00:39:23,767 --> 00:39:25,616
I respectfully disagree.

488
00:39:25,975 --> 00:39:29,337
Such military tactics risk wasting more time, general.

489
00:39:29,671 --> 00:39:32,786
If my military tactics had been used to begin with...

490
00:39:32,811 --> 00:39:35,327
Dola wouldn't have had a chance
to interfere with us at all!

491
00:39:35,961 --> 00:39:39,714
It was a military transmission that the pirates decoded.

492
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:42,784
You've bungled things, sir. and now I must fix them.

493
00:39:43,503 --> 00:39:44,830
Your job, general...

494
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:47,650
is to mobilize the troops when it becomes necessary.

495
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:53,808
Muska, just don't forget that the
government put me in charge of finding Laputa!

496
00:39:54,213 --> 00:39:56,724
Don't forget that as the government's secret agent...

497
00:39:56,772 --> 00:39:58,424
I am in charge of you, general.

498
00:40:01,761 --> 00:40:04,858
Blast. I really hate that man.

499
00:40:17,531 --> 00:40:18,395
Huh?

500
00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:23,849
I trust you slept well?

501
00:40:23,984 --> 00:40:26,415
Where is Pazu? Is he all right? I want to see him!

502
00:40:26,463 --> 00:40:28,432
Now, this is fit for a princess.

503
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:33,419
Don't worry, Sheeta. Your friend is being
treated as if he were the guest of royalty.

504
00:40:34,137 --> 00:40:37,134
I want you to see something before you see him.

505
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:52,927
Please step inside.

506
00:41:11,797 --> 00:41:12,924
What is it?

507
00:41:13,536 --> 00:41:15,475
An artificial life form.

508
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,097
It's called a robot.

509
00:41:17,492 --> 00:41:20,846
Laputa was just a legend until this dropped from the sky.

510
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:26,281
Huh?

511
00:41:26,812 --> 00:41:27,713
Aah!

512
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:28,941
Oh! Ohh!

513
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:40,066
Now the government wants me to unlock Laputa's secrets.

514
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:43,657
For example, what's this fellow
made of metal or ceramics?

515
00:41:43,808 --> 00:41:46,343
With our limited technology, we have no idea.

516
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:48,360
But he does tell us one thing.

517
00:41:49,066 --> 00:41:50,116
Come and see.

518
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:53,882
Don't be afraid, Sheeta. He's really quite dead, you know.

519
00:42:00,747 --> 00:42:01,826
Look there.

520
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:11,251
It's the same emblem that
decorates the fireplace in your home.

521
00:42:12,118 --> 00:42:13,300
And your crystal.

522
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:18,147
You see, Sheeta, this crystal also comes from Laputa.

523
00:42:20,673 --> 00:42:26,887
And I believe the powers locked inside it are
capable of leading a person back to that city's treasures.

524
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:29,118
Then why? Why don't you just take it?

525
00:42:29,645 --> 00:42:35,237
Just take it and keep Laputa's treasures for
yourself but leave Pazu and me alone, please!

526
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,400
You think I'm doing this for money?

527
00:42:40,479 --> 00:42:41,774
You understand nothing.

528
00:42:41,933 --> 00:42:47,683
According to the legend, the same technology
that kept Laputa airborne also made it

529
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:50,672
a major power that once dominated the entire planet.

530
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:55,701
If such a horrible thing is still floating up there

531
00:42:55,725 --> 00:42:58,586
you can understand what a threat
it is to the peace of the world.

532
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:02,788
Sheeta, the stone only works for you.

533
00:43:03,575 --> 00:43:08,689
You must know of some way to make the
stone point out the location of Laputa.

534
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:12,552
I really don't know anything. Please let me see Pazu!

535
00:43:13,593 --> 00:43:16,449
I don't want to see any harm come to anyone...

536
00:43:16,522 --> 00:43:19,686
but I simply can't control
what the military might do to him.

537
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:20,520
What?!

538
00:43:22,006 --> 00:43:23,854
In the event that you cooperate...

539
00:43:23,879 --> 00:43:26,956
I'm sure whosever is in charge
will grant Pazu his freedom...

540
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,176
Lusheeta Toel Ul Laputa.

541
00:43:32,327 --> 00:43:33,741
You know my real name.

542
00:43:33,821 --> 00:43:36,936
"Ul" means "ruler" in Laputian. "Toel" means "true."

543
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:41,631
You are the legitimate heir to the
throne of Laputa, Princess Lusheeta.

544
00:43:55,328 --> 00:43:56,788
Aah!

545
00:43:57,341 --> 00:43:58,433
Unh!

546
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:02,875
Let's go! Out!

547
00:44:05,671 --> 00:44:06,379
Sheeta!

548
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,839
Are you all right, Pazu?

549
00:44:08,908 --> 00:44:11,490
I'm OK, but what about you?
They didn't hurt you, did they?

550
00:44:11,853 --> 00:44:15,367
Pazu, I'm so sorry. There's been a grave misunderstanding.

551
00:44:15,494 --> 00:44:21,038
We had no idea how nobly you fought to protect
our little Sheeta from those awful pirates.

552
00:44:21,214 --> 00:44:22,460
What's he talking about?

553
00:44:23,047 --> 00:44:26,695
Pazu, do this for me. Forget about Laputa.

554
00:44:27,323 --> 00:44:28,555
What are you saying?

555
00:44:28,633 --> 00:44:34,116
It's been decided that the search for Laputa will be
made secretly by the army with Sheeta's cooperation.

556
00:44:34,528 --> 00:44:37,745
Really, the best thing you can do
is forget you ever heard of the place.

557
00:44:37,906 --> 00:44:39,335
Forget about Laputa?

558
00:44:40,003 --> 00:44:42,369
I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble.

559
00:44:42,528 --> 00:44:44,680
I hope someday you can forgive me.

560
00:44:44,942 --> 00:44:46,825
I can't forget! No way!

561
00:44:46,912 --> 00:44:49,156
Laputa means too much to both of us!

562
00:44:49,282 --> 00:44:50,270
Good-bye!

563
00:44:50,294 --> 00:44:51,172
Sheeta!

564
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,382
Aah! Come back!

565
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,278
Now, behave, little boy. Use your head!

566
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:11,584
Here, take this a little something
to show our appreciation of your efforts.

567
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,848
Only you can do it.

568
00:45:48,908 --> 00:45:51,474
Remember the words that bring the crystal to life.

569
00:45:52,602 --> 00:45:55,379
Keep your promise, and you too will be free.

570
00:46:16,271 --> 00:46:18,279
Unh! Huh?

571
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,828
Hey, mommy! Mommy, it's Pazu! Pazu's outside!

572
00:46:28,187 --> 00:46:30,038
Oh, my! Pazu!

573
00:46:31,126 --> 00:46:32,647
Where have you been?

574
00:46:32,718 --> 00:46:34,657
We were all very worried about you, Pazu.

575
00:46:35,022 --> 00:46:36,459
What happened to your friend?

576
00:46:37,411 --> 00:46:38,369
It's over now.

577
00:46:38,491 --> 00:46:39,404
What?

578
00:46:40,493 --> 00:46:42,151
Pazu! Come back!

579
00:46:48,034 --> 00:46:48,726
Unh!

580
00:47:21,315 --> 00:47:22,817
Welcome home, sonny.

581
00:47:22,944 --> 00:47:25,884
Get out! Aah! Get out, or I'll throw you out!

582
00:47:26,933 --> 00:47:28,349
This is my house!

583
00:47:28,609 --> 00:47:31,150
Oh, you don't scare me.

584
00:47:31,577 --> 00:47:34,069
You can't even protect one small girl!

585
00:47:34,196 --> 00:47:34,950
What do you mean?

586
00:47:35,005 --> 00:47:36,911
Hey, Mom, can I keep this money?

587
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:39,699
Up and sold the little girl, did you? I know your type.

588
00:47:39,999 --> 00:47:41,764
You don't know what you're talking about!

589
00:47:41,947 --> 00:47:45,149
They offered you money, and you took it, didn't you?

590
00:47:45,744 --> 00:47:48,098
I only left because Sheeta told me to!

591
00:47:48,971 --> 00:47:49,796
That's why.

592
00:47:51,314 --> 00:47:54,174
So, you believed her, and you came back here, right?

593
00:47:54,309 --> 00:47:56,504
You're just a scared little boy who runs away!

594
00:47:57,766 --> 00:47:58,696
Says you!

595
00:47:58,818 --> 00:48:01,048
You don't even have the guts to
stand up to Muska and the army!

596
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:06,180
He who turns and runs away can
steal the treasure another day!

597
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:11,216
Don't you think it's kind of strange that
the army's gotten into the kidnapping business?

598
00:48:14,911 --> 00:48:16,857
Do you really think they'll keep her alive?

599
00:48:16,882 --> 00:48:19,195
Don't you see that they forced her to make a deal?

600
00:48:19,401 --> 00:48:20,020
Huh?

601
00:48:24,627 --> 00:48:27,870
She saved your life. Get it?

602
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:32,588
Mommy, you amaze me. How do you know these things?

603
00:48:32,771 --> 00:48:37,332
Well, you can't be a sensitive woman
like me without leaning a few things.

604
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:41,948
Sheeta and I are exactly alike
all warm and mushy and sensitive.

605
00:48:42,281 --> 00:48:44,173
Now, so when you boys get married...

606
00:48:44,198 --> 00:48:45,808
You go find a gal like her.

607
00:48:46,081 --> 00:48:49,090
Huh? She's gonna end up like mama?

608
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,357
Aw, Mom, that was...

609
00:48:56,381 --> 00:48:57,481
The ham! Gimme that!

610
00:48:58,458 --> 00:48:59,688
Hmm.

611
00:49:00,507 --> 00:49:03,201
Well, it won't work changing the code on me.

612
00:49:04,795 --> 00:49:07,130
They're calling for air destroyer Goliath.

613
00:49:15,913 --> 00:49:17,804
They're planning to take off with Sheeta.

614
00:49:17,891 --> 00:49:19,765
We've got to hurry, or it'll be too late!

615
00:49:19,995 --> 00:49:22,205
Come on, boys! Stop eating!

616
00:49:22,594 --> 00:49:24,827
I'm going!

617
00:49:26,154 --> 00:49:27,651
Wait! Are you going to rescue Sheeta?

618
00:49:27,775 --> 00:49:30,285
No, you little squirt. We want her crystal.

619
00:49:30,456 --> 00:49:33,164
Wait a minute! You've got to have
Sheeta to make the aetherium crystal work.

620
00:49:33,219 --> 00:49:34,514
Otherwise, it's useless!

621
00:49:34,593 --> 00:49:37,109
Please let me come with you! I need to save her!

622
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:39,237
Sheeta means everything to me.

623
00:49:39,357 --> 00:49:40,573
You know something?

624
00:49:40,883 --> 00:49:43,240
You're acting like a sniveling little crybaby.

625
00:49:43,553 --> 00:49:47,248
Maybe you're right. I should have protected
Sheeta but instead, I was stupid and angry.

626
00:49:47,605 --> 00:49:50,203
But let me come with you and I
swear I'll protect her this time!

627
00:49:50,752 --> 00:49:51,967
Pazu loves Sheeta

628
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:52,650
Be quiet!

629
00:49:53,656 --> 00:49:54,342
Hmm.

630
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:03,876
Guess you'll be useful in getting Sheeta to cooperate.

631
00:50:05,069 --> 00:50:07,596
You might never come back here again, Pazu.

632
00:50:07,621 --> 00:50:08,249
I know.

633
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:09,943
Ready for what might happen?

634
00:50:09,967 --> 00:50:10,653
Mm-hmm.

635
00:50:12,397 --> 00:50:14,539
We leave here in one minute!

636
00:50:23,416 --> 00:50:24,740
Now, you guys be good.

637
00:50:33,058 --> 00:50:34,718
Here, fasten this.

638
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:35,035
Right!

639
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:37,141
Let's rendezvous at the Tiger Moth.

640
00:51:09,047 --> 00:51:10,715
What a superb ship!

641
00:51:11,082 --> 00:51:13,181
Muska, has the girl surrendered the information?

642
00:51:13,206 --> 00:51:15,000
It will take a little more time.

643
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:15,969
More time?

644
00:51:16,128 --> 00:51:18,423
Well, you'll have plenty of that aboard Goliath.

645
00:51:18,567 --> 00:51:20,551
We set out with her at first light.

646
00:51:41,852 --> 00:51:44,245
Hurry! We have to get there before sun up!

647
00:51:50,648 --> 00:51:51,647
Sheeta.

648
00:52:15,808 --> 00:52:18,089
Well, well, now, what shall we do?

649
00:52:20,663 --> 00:52:25,033
Sheeta, maybe grandma should teach you a spell...

650
00:52:25,292 --> 00:52:27,949
one that will help you when you're in trouble.

651
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:28,901
A spell?

652
00:52:29,433 --> 00:52:32,517
Yes, my dearest. An ancient secret spell.

653
00:52:33,614 --> 00:52:38,179
Leetay latuparita ulus arialos balu netoreel.

654
00:52:39,402 --> 00:52:41,237
Leetay a...

655
00:52:42,054 --> 00:52:43,836
The words mean "save me."

656
00:52:44,181 --> 00:52:47,903
"Save me and revive the eternal light."

657
00:52:48,296 --> 00:52:53,290
So, Leetay latuparita ulus arialos balu netoreel.

658
00:52:54,199 --> 00:52:56,801
Leetay latuparita ulus...

659
00:52:56,974 --> 00:52:59,684
arialos balu netoreel.

660
00:53:05,858 --> 00:53:08,543
Aah! Aah!

661
00:53:12,277 --> 00:53:13,945
Aah!

662
00:53:22,272 --> 00:53:25,409
Ahh. I knew it!

663
00:53:32,225 --> 00:53:33,999
It's the sacred light!

664
00:53:34,099 --> 00:53:36,897
The ancient documents were true! It's not just a legend!

665
00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:38,597
What are you talking about?

666
00:53:39,051 --> 00:53:40,123
Aaah!

667
00:53:41,541 --> 00:53:42,403
Oh!

668
00:53:43,702 --> 00:53:47,362
Tell me the spell! What are the secret words?

669
00:53:56,357 --> 00:53:57,333
Did you hear that?

670
00:53:57,924 --> 00:53:58,667
Yeah.

671
00:54:04,864 --> 00:54:05,607
Huh?

672
00:54:15,047 --> 00:54:17,198
I'm telling you, this thing is alive!

673
00:54:17,364 --> 00:54:19,142
Do you hear me? Alive!

674
00:54:24,848 --> 00:54:25,424
What?

675
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:31,181
Help, it's alive! And it's after us!

676
00:54:31,252 --> 00:54:32,064
Run for your lives!

677
00:54:32,089 --> 00:54:34,668
It's the robot! Go! Run!

678
00:54:38,804 --> 00:54:40,761
It's come back to life!

679
00:54:40,873 --> 00:54:44,210
Hurry! Hurry! Sound the alarm! Quick! Quick!

680
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:46,672
He's moving!

681
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:49,910
What's happening?

682
00:54:49,934 --> 00:54:50,938
Sir, it's the robot.

683
00:55:02,943 --> 00:55:04,468
It's coming toward us!

684
00:55:08,895 --> 00:55:11,428
Shut the fire door! Hurry!

685
00:55:16,174 --> 00:55:16,899
Pull back!

686
00:55:16,923 --> 00:55:17,855
Look out!

687
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,254
Aah!

688
00:55:22,278 --> 00:55:23,403
The power!

689
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:32,800
Yes, I understand.

690
00:55:34,635 --> 00:55:35,849
It's your crystal.

691
00:55:35,928 --> 00:55:39,666
The force of the sacred light
has brought the robot back to life!

692
00:55:39,761 --> 00:55:41,999
The way to Laputa has been opened!

693
00:55:42,024 --> 00:55:44,058
Let me go!

694
00:55:47,306 --> 00:55:48,161
Ohh!

695
00:55:48,185 --> 00:55:49,078
Unh!

696
00:55:51,944 --> 00:55:52,893
Aah!

697
00:56:04,391 --> 00:56:05,698
It's going to fly!

698
00:56:13,596 --> 00:56:14,867
Aah!

699
00:56:22,953 --> 00:56:23,908
Oh!

700
00:56:33,908 --> 00:56:35,747
Oh! Oh!

701
00:56:50,729 --> 00:56:53,415
Oh! Oh!

702
00:56:57,977 --> 00:56:59,279
It's Laputa.

703
00:57:04,049 --> 00:57:07,416
Finally. I now know the way to Laputa.

704
00:57:07,551 --> 00:57:09,416
Hurry! No time to waste!

705
00:57:09,743 --> 00:57:13,572
What do you mean, robot? I want to
know who's trying to blow up my fortress!

706
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,863
Are you there? Somebody answer me now!

707
00:57:18,173 --> 00:57:18,958
We're ready.

708
00:57:18,982 --> 00:57:20,446
You're connected now, Colonel.

709
00:57:20,835 --> 00:57:23,266
This is Colonel Muska. We have an emergency.

710
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:24,975
You'll take your orders from me now.

711
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:26,150
Huh?

712
00:57:41,926 --> 00:57:44,322
Hurry! I need that shell now!

713
00:58:05,133 --> 00:58:06,289
Fire!

714
00:58:08,246 --> 00:58:09,402
Aah!

715
00:58:23,762 --> 00:58:26,047
Let's get up there now!

716
00:58:28,366 --> 00:58:29,001
We demolished it!

717
00:58:29,025 --> 00:58:30,234
We got him!

718
00:58:30,314 --> 00:58:31,244
Go get the girl!

719
00:58:31,269 --> 00:58:32,011
Over there!

720
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:34,515
Make sure it doesn't move, now.

721
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,018
Is she dead?

722
00:58:37,509 --> 00:58:38,623
Hey, get up.

723
00:58:40,784 --> 00:58:42,413
Nah, she's only fainted.

724
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,100
Come on.

725
00:58:43,125 --> 00:58:43,946
Oh, no!

726
00:58:55,113 --> 00:58:55,998
Aah!

727
00:59:30,126 --> 00:59:30,934
Wow

728
00:59:35,771 --> 00:59:37,744
Must be some kind of war goin' on!

729
00:59:37,769 --> 00:59:38,693
Take her down, Dola!

730
00:59:38,717 --> 00:59:40,431
Call me captain!

731
00:59:40,492 --> 00:59:42,642
Whee!

732
00:59:42,874 --> 00:59:44,273
Ha ha ha!

733
00:59:46,568 --> 00:59:49,063
Just keep your big head down, Shalulu!

734
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:05,185
Huh?

735
01:00:07,601 --> 01:00:10,127
Stop it! You're destroying everything!

736
01:00:10,238 --> 01:00:11,930
Please, stop!

737
01:00:20,278 --> 01:00:23,258
Captain Mother, Goliath is moving! Goliath is moving!

738
01:00:29,596 --> 01:00:32,633
If we stay on this heading, we'll be in the line of fire.

739
01:00:32,689 --> 01:00:33,353
Change course!

740
01:00:33,377 --> 01:00:34,201
Look! There she is!

741
01:00:34,289 --> 01:00:35,579
It's Sheeta! - What?

742
01:00:37,614 --> 01:00:40,458
Where'd you see her? - Steady as she goes, captain!

743
01:00:40,791 --> 01:00:42,350
She's on top of that tower!

744
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:52,403
One for all and all for mom!

745
01:00:52,453 --> 01:00:53,329
Cover me!

746
01:00:53,737 --> 01:00:54,534
Good luck!

747
01:01:06,089 --> 01:01:07,829
Sheeta!

748
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,713
My hand take it!

749
01:01:12,054 --> 01:01:13,390
Pazu!

750
01:01:15,241 --> 01:01:17,156
I've gotta get in a little closer, Dola!

751
01:01:17,752 --> 01:01:20,301
Aah! Uhh!

752
01:01:20,914 --> 01:01:22,025
Pazu!

753
01:01:23,225 --> 01:01:26,943
But they're here to help me! Please, put me down!

754
01:01:35,908 --> 01:01:37,756
Aah!

755
01:01:45,705 --> 01:01:47,181
Sheeta!

756
01:01:47,206 --> 01:01:47,999
Uhh!

757
01:01:50,687 --> 01:01:51,430
Dola!

758
01:01:55,806 --> 01:01:57,635
No! They're falling!

759
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:06,278
No.

760
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,186
Help!

761
01:02:14,651 --> 01:02:15,599
Come on!

762
01:02:28,979 --> 01:02:31,431
Oh, come on, pull up!

763
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:32,774
Uhh!

764
01:02:36,994 --> 01:02:38,381
It's now or never, Pazu.

765
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:39,883
I'll take us in, and you grab her.

766
01:02:39,911 --> 01:02:40,379
Right!

767
01:02:41,611 --> 01:02:42,969
Over here!

768
01:02:43,247 --> 01:02:44,669
OK, captain!

769
01:02:46,791 --> 01:02:48,884
What are you doing? Fools! Don't let her escape!

770
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,155
Aaah!

771
01:02:55,846 --> 01:02:58,801
An entire army, and they're getting away!

772
01:03:04,737 --> 01:03:06,261
It's not over.

773
01:03:18,214 --> 01:03:21,865
Muska, Muska! What on earth happened to the robot?

774
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:24,552
We destroyed it, and the girl's gone.

775
01:03:24,655 --> 01:03:26,872
What?! Ohh!

776
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:28,842
Look at this. It's a disaster.

777
01:03:29,971 --> 01:03:32,201
I think we may have found what you've been looking for.

778
01:03:32,411 --> 01:03:35,031
Extinguish the fire! Organize a pursuit team!

779
01:03:48,856 --> 01:03:51,630
It still possesses its sacred light...

780
01:03:53,869 --> 01:03:55,736
pointing to Laputa.

781
01:03:57,213 --> 01:03:59,348
You may now go tell the general for me...

782
01:03:59,373 --> 01:04:00,912
we will be departing on time.

783
01:04:38,775 --> 01:04:40,106
Sheeta, you OK?

784
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:41,945
If I did something wrong...

785
01:04:41,993 --> 01:04:44,567
I'd really like to apologize for it, Sheeta.

786
01:04:44,642 --> 01:04:46,315
We all did something wrong...

787
01:04:46,411 --> 01:04:48,572
wastin' our time on these two kids.

788
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:53,235
Here's your valley up ahead. I'll
drop you off there, and that'll be that.

789
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:54,448
It's all-right.

790
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:57,710
Dola, will you let us sail with you and the boys?

791
01:04:57,789 --> 01:04:59,297
Call me captain, darn it!

792
01:04:59,369 --> 01:05:03,063
I don't see what the heck's in it for
me since you've lost the aetherium crystal!

793
01:05:03,547 --> 01:05:04,365
We can work.

794
01:05:04,437 --> 01:05:08,243
And I have to find out the real
truth about Laputa for myself, captain.

795
01:05:14,432 --> 01:05:18,637
So, you're not interested in money but
you want to find out the truth about Laputa.

796
01:05:18,662 --> 01:05:21,829
Heh heh. Well, I guess there's worse
reasons for you wanting to become a pirate.

797
01:05:21,932 --> 01:05:23,868
Mother, I say let 'em come along.

798
01:05:24,352 --> 01:05:26,827
Tow the line and work hard, or overboard you go.

799
01:05:26,852 --> 01:05:27,819
Yes, captain.

800
01:05:27,844 --> 01:05:30,662
Yes! No more swabbin' the decks! Hooray!

801
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:32,521
I won't have to wash the dishes!

802
01:05:32,584 --> 01:05:35,535
I've peeled my last potato! Yee-haw!

803
01:05:35,871 --> 01:05:39,326
Whoopee!

804
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:41,262
Sheeta, can you make pudding?

805
01:05:41,351 --> 01:05:42,635
I love pudding!

806
01:05:42,734 --> 01:05:45,035
I get to lick the spatula!

807
01:05:45,114 --> 01:05:46,879
And I like chocolate cake with that...

808
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,319
Oh, what's that frosting? It's kind of pink and swirly.

809
01:05:49,391 --> 01:05:52,145
Will you shut up? Ah, what can I tell you?

810
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:53,934
They just really like dessert.

811
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:39,902
Whoa!

812
01:06:40,084 --> 01:06:41,474
And disembark.

813
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:47,427
Uhh! Wow, what is this ship made out of, cloth?

814
01:06:47,585 --> 01:06:49,009
And don't you rip it!

815
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:50,025
Uhh!

816
01:06:50,212 --> 01:06:51,844
Come on, we'll go topside.

817
01:06:56,047 --> 01:06:56,777
Ohh!

818
01:06:58,930 --> 01:07:00,924
You're goin' the wrong way! Come here!

819
01:07:00,987 --> 01:07:02,361
I don't like slow-pokes!

820
01:07:04,419 --> 01:07:05,233
Ohh!

821
01:07:05,257 --> 01:07:06,340
Pazu?

822
01:07:06,435 --> 01:07:08,445
Come on, matey. I haven't got all day.

823
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:10,479
Work, work, work. Busy, busy, busy, busy.

824
01:07:10,504 --> 01:07:12,879
Left, right, left, right. You're not here to have fun.

825
01:07:16,083 --> 01:07:18,371
Whoa. This engine room is really amazing.

826
01:07:18,396 --> 01:07:19,879
Is that what it's called?

827
01:07:20,231 --> 01:07:22,604
Hey, papa! Where are you?!

828
01:07:22,656 --> 01:07:23,184
Oh!

829
01:07:23,836 --> 01:07:27,229
Hey, pop, I finally found you an assistant!

830
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:30,399
Stop yelling at me! I can hear you!

831
01:07:30,424 --> 01:07:32,408
Believe me, sometimes I wish I couldn't.

832
01:07:34,209 --> 01:07:37,372
Uh, hurry up. He is even tougher than my mother.

833
01:07:45,223 --> 01:07:46,986
It's too narrow. I can't reach.

834
01:07:47,011 --> 01:07:48,193
It's OK. I got it.

835
01:07:48,268 --> 01:07:48,921
What's your name?

836
01:07:48,945 --> 01:07:49,726
Pazu.

837
01:07:52,112 --> 01:07:55,750
But the beam from the crystal
was pointing directly due east.

838
01:07:56,234 --> 01:07:57,530
Are you sure about this?

839
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:01,176
Yes, I'm sure I could see the sun rising from the tower.

840
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:05,508
You know, it's the end of grass-cutting
season so the sun rose not from due east...

841
01:08:05,603 --> 01:08:07,024
but a little further south.

842
01:08:07,245 --> 01:08:10,942
The light was pointing to the left of
the hill from which the sun rose, you see?

843
01:08:10,967 --> 01:08:13,515
Pretty smart. Found anything yet?

844
01:08:13,761 --> 01:08:15,605
Haven't found a single thing, captain.

845
01:08:15,732 --> 01:08:18,664
They're jamming the airwaves so we
can't find 'em. the flying devils.

846
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:22,201
Mom, how can we catch them
when they're faster than we are?

847
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,893
Well, It looks like we're
cruising on the windward side of 'em.

848
01:08:25,369 --> 01:08:27,681
So if we manage to ride the trade wind...

849
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:31,050
Let's see. According to my calculations...

850
01:08:31,154 --> 01:08:33,497
with wind velocity at ten...

851
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:36,189
looks to me like we'll catch 'em.

852
01:08:37,931 --> 01:08:40,624
Attention, all hands! Now hear this!

853
01:08:40,704 --> 01:08:43,540
Goliath is already underway for Laputa.

854
01:08:43,648 --> 01:08:45,573
We're gonna set sail and go after them.

855
01:08:45,717 --> 01:08:48,926
If we can catch the wind we'll
be on their heels by tomorrow.

856
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:53,550
The first man to spy Goliath will receive ten gold coins.

857
01:08:53,693 --> 01:08:54,489
That's good money!

858
01:08:54,559 --> 01:08:57,516
And if the stories we've heard about Laputa are true...

859
01:08:57,579 --> 01:09:00,621
there'll be enough treasure to
make an honest pirate of us all.

860
01:09:00,788 --> 01:09:05,387
Ha ha! All right! All hands
aboard! Look alive and get to work!

861
01:09:11,844 --> 01:09:12,777
Let her rip!

862
01:09:20,014 --> 01:09:23,082
Course, ninety-eight degrees. Velocity, fifty.

863
01:09:53,113 --> 01:09:55,810
Now you gotta start dressing like a real pirate.

864
01:09:55,948 --> 01:09:58,070
Let's see here.

865
01:10:08,768 --> 01:10:11,545
And this is where you'll be working.

866
01:10:16,519 --> 01:10:20,620
This is the galley. I want it shipshape
sparkling clean, and ready for action in one hour.

867
01:10:20,676 --> 01:10:21,571
That's an order.

868
01:10:21,595 --> 01:10:22,612
But I...

869
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:26,785
The boys get awful hungry, so you'll serve 5 meals a day.

870
01:10:34,089 --> 01:10:37,663
You blubber-heads! I'm not runnin'
a luxury cruise! Now get to work!

871
01:10:42,589 --> 01:10:43,843
Mmm.

872
01:11:06,715 --> 01:11:07,349
Hmm?

873
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:08,842
Hmm.

874
01:11:09,906 --> 01:11:10,972
Hmm?

875
01:11:28,856 --> 01:11:29,835
Come in.

876
01:11:33,954 --> 01:11:37,068
I'm afraid I'm still cooking. Nothing's ready yet.

877
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,245
It took me a long time to clean everything up.

878
01:11:40,925 --> 01:11:41,528
Ahem.

879
01:11:41,552 --> 01:11:43,462
Uh, yes? What is it?

880
01:11:45,647 --> 01:11:46,739
Uh...

881
01:11:47,242 --> 01:11:48,036
Yes?

882
01:11:48,392 --> 01:11:52,423
I finished my work for the moment
and I've come to offer you my help.

883
01:11:52,536 --> 01:11:54,013
Well, that's kind of you.

884
01:11:54,162 --> 01:11:56,237
Would you please hand me those plates over there?

885
01:11:56,388 --> 01:11:58,580
With pleasure, my little ang ohh!

886
01:12:01,413 --> 01:12:03,967
I thought you said you had a stomach ache.

887
01:12:04,793 --> 01:12:06,923
I'm in love with you!

888
01:12:06,986 --> 01:12:07,591
You?

889
01:12:07,616 --> 01:12:08,559
Hello.

890
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:09,597
Move!

891
01:12:09,669 --> 01:12:10,690
Too crowded.

892
01:12:11,143 --> 01:12:12,620
Hey, what do I look like, a chair?

893
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:14,327
Hi. Is there anything I can do?

894
01:12:14,352 --> 01:12:15,064
Huh?

895
01:12:15,088 --> 01:12:15,853
Hey!

896
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,919
What's come over you, my dear?

897
01:12:25,959 --> 01:12:28,724
It's not like you to challenge a ship like Goliath.

898
01:12:29,146 --> 01:12:30,907
You know, the odds are against you.

899
01:12:31,023 --> 01:12:33,419
I'm after treasure. That's all.

900
01:12:33,865 --> 01:12:37,718
Heh heh heh. I must admit, those kids are cute.

901
01:12:37,829 --> 01:12:40,107
What do you mean by that, you old fool?

902
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:44,647
Nothing. But that little girl does
remind me of you not so long ago.

903
01:12:44,734 --> 01:12:45,573
Who asked ya?

904
01:12:45,597 --> 01:12:46,402
Nobody.

905
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:48,471
Oh, look. Checkmate.

906
01:12:48,495 --> 01:12:49,031
Huh?

907
01:12:49,308 --> 01:12:50,460
Fabulous!

908
01:12:55,870 --> 01:12:57,310
Does anyone want any more?

909
01:12:57,762 --> 01:12:59,667
I do believe I will have a second helping.

910
01:12:59,692 --> 01:13:01,067
I want some more!

911
01:13:20,181 --> 01:13:21,240
Come on, young pup.

912
01:13:21,896 --> 01:13:22,723
Huh?

913
01:13:24,878 --> 01:13:26,251
Time to go on duty.

914
01:13:26,714 --> 01:13:28,547
It's cold. Take this.

915
01:13:30,661 --> 01:13:31,375
Huh?

916
01:13:46,062 --> 01:13:47,138
I'll take over.

917
01:13:47,224 --> 01:13:48,572
Thank you!

918
01:13:58,272 --> 01:13:58,812
Huh?

919
01:14:01,576 --> 01:14:02,300
Sheeta!

920
01:14:03,531 --> 01:14:06,430
Ohh. Whoa!

921
01:14:06,494 --> 01:14:09,163
Ohh! That was exciting.

922
01:14:09,257 --> 01:14:11,570
Wow! You can see forever.

923
01:14:21,942 --> 01:14:23,225
Ohh.

924
01:14:23,741 --> 01:14:25,370
Sheeta? Here.

925
01:14:29,479 --> 01:14:30,511
You OK?

926
01:14:30,584 --> 01:14:31,567
That's better.

927
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:36,455
This is great. Now we can keep watch together.

928
01:14:40,348 --> 01:14:41,145
Pazu?

929
01:14:41,405 --> 01:14:42,193
Hmm?

930
01:14:43,097 --> 01:14:44,432
I'm really scared.

931
01:14:45,337 --> 01:14:48,752
To tell you the truth, I don't want to go to Laputa.

932
01:14:49,261 --> 01:14:50,135
What do you mean?

933
01:14:50,805 --> 01:14:52,280
Didn't you tell Dola the truth?

934
01:14:53,306 --> 01:14:54,773
I didn't lie to Dola.

935
01:14:55,161 --> 01:14:57,823
What I said about the light's direction is true.

936
01:14:58,087 --> 01:15:00,454
But what if someone else dies?

937
01:15:00,647 --> 01:15:02,012
You mean, like the robot?

938
01:15:02,082 --> 01:15:03,957
He died to save my life.

939
01:15:04,339 --> 01:15:05,761
I feel awful.

940
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:09,724
All this is because of a spell my grandmother taught me.

941
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:12,324
She taught me all sorts of spells.

942
01:15:12,713 --> 01:15:15,143
A spell to use when you're looking for something...

943
01:15:15,438 --> 01:15:17,156
a spell to cure sickness.

944
01:15:17,457 --> 01:15:20,349
There's even one she told me I must never use.

945
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,584
What kind of spell?

946
01:15:21,651 --> 01:15:23,359
The spell of destruction.

947
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:27,714
She said that to give power to good
spells I had to know evil ones, too.

948
01:15:27,934 --> 01:15:29,875
But she told me never to use them.

949
01:15:30,558 --> 01:15:34,063
I was so scared when I leaned that spell I couldn't sleep.

950
01:15:34,215 --> 01:15:37,207
I didn't know the spells were connected to my necklace.

951
01:15:37,655 --> 01:15:42,826
Uncle Pom was right when he said that it was
dangerous for us to misuse the power of the crystal.

952
01:15:43,381 --> 01:15:47,323
And what if Laputa has the same power
that can also be used for great evil?

953
01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:50,788
I wish I'd thrown the crystal away.

954
01:15:51,445 --> 01:15:52,627
But then we never would have met.

955
01:15:52,699 --> 01:15:55,410
And anyway, even if you had, Laputa would still exist.

956
01:15:56,166 --> 01:15:59,034
Airplanes and flying machines
are getting better and better.

957
01:15:59,554 --> 01:16:04,343
You know, eventually, some explorer or another will
come across the city of Laputa one day and claim it.

958
01:16:05,773 --> 01:16:09,147
I can't say I know what's best but if
Laputa really has such great power...

959
01:16:09,239 --> 01:16:11,836
we can't let it fall into the
hands of bad people like Muska.

960
01:16:13,511 --> 01:16:18,428
And if we run away now, Muska is gonna chase us forever.

961
01:16:18,558 --> 01:16:21,908
But Pazu, I don't want you to
become a pirate, because of me.

962
01:16:22,148 --> 01:16:24,371
I'm not gonna become a pirate.

963
01:16:24,712 --> 01:16:26,563
And don't worry. Dola will understand.

964
01:16:26,595 --> 01:16:28,557
She's much nicer than she pretends to be.

965
01:16:29,025 --> 01:16:30,510
And when we've finally found it...

966
01:16:30,637 --> 01:16:32,624
I promise you we'll go back to Gondoa.

967
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:34,594
I want to see it all, Sheeta.

968
01:16:34,704 --> 01:16:37,486
The old house where you were
born, the valley and everything.

969
01:16:37,744 --> 01:16:38,893
Oh, Pazu.

970
01:16:41,426 --> 01:16:42,499
Sheeta, what's that?

971
01:16:43,587 --> 01:16:45,684
Right there. Under the ship. See it?

972
01:16:53,023 --> 01:16:56,007
Captain, it's Goliath right under our bow!

973
01:17:00,421 --> 01:17:02,599
Starboard rudder, full speed ahead!

974
01:17:32,608 --> 01:17:35,526
Why don't you go after them, Muska? Get them!

975
01:17:35,723 --> 01:17:38,520
It's useless to look for them in the cloud cover.

976
01:17:38,734 --> 01:17:42,063
I don't need to waste my energy on a wild-goose chase.

977
01:17:42,206 --> 01:17:44,804
Besides, we're running right on schedule.

978
01:17:56,985 --> 01:17:59,513
It was farther north than I figured.

979
01:17:59,584 --> 01:18:01,759
Pazu, listen carefully to me.

980
01:18:01,828 --> 01:18:04,969
Everything will be ruined if we lose track of Goliath.

981
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,965
You've got good eyes. so I want you
to watch her and keep us on course.

982
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:09,251
How do I do that, captain?

983
01:18:09,299 --> 01:18:11,079
The crow's nest can be made into a kite.

984
01:18:11,151 --> 01:18:12,843
See the metal handle on the bulkhead?

985
01:18:12,977 --> 01:18:13,747
I got it!

986
01:18:14,204 --> 01:18:15,669
Turn it clockwise!

987
01:18:18,045 --> 01:18:21,597
Hook it up and then turn the
handle. That'll make the wings open.

988
01:18:26,162 --> 01:18:27,629
Now extend the wire.

989
01:18:27,654 --> 01:18:30,050
You'll have to get the hang of flying it on your own.

990
01:18:31,034 --> 01:18:32,950
Are you up there, Sheeta, my dear?

991
01:18:33,006 --> 01:18:33,502
Yes.

992
01:18:33,526 --> 01:18:35,032
Best you come down right now.

993
01:18:35,088 --> 01:18:36,294
Why?

994
01:18:36,729 --> 01:18:39,148
Because you're a girl a female! That's man's work!

995
01:18:39,268 --> 01:18:41,065
But you're female, captain!

996
01:18:41,419 --> 01:18:43,485
I grew up in the mountains. I can do this!

997
01:18:43,628 --> 01:18:44,470
Sheeta, no!

998
01:18:44,508 --> 01:18:47,528
Be quiet. And Pazu agrees with me.

999
01:18:48,174 --> 01:18:50,199
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1000
01:18:50,452 --> 01:18:52,244
All right, me hearty, once you take off...

1001
01:18:52,335 --> 01:18:54,304
you'll have to use the phone to communicate.

1002
01:18:56,116 --> 01:18:57,292
You mean this phone?

1003
01:18:58,142 --> 01:18:59,376
She is good.

1004
01:18:59,527 --> 01:19:02,187
Right. I think we're set. Ready for takeoff.

1005
01:19:02,255 --> 01:19:03,776
Aye-aye. Anchors away!

1006
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:24,775
I don't see them.

1007
01:19:25,044 --> 01:19:26,705
They must be hiding under the cloud cover.

1008
01:19:26,919 --> 01:19:29,240
Perhaps. But they could also be above you.

1009
01:19:29,367 --> 01:19:30,368
Keep your eyes peeled..

1010
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:33,299
Roger! Whoa!

1011
01:19:33,767 --> 01:19:34,799
Hang on tight!

1012
01:19:41,761 --> 01:19:43,047
What happened?

1013
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,318
Nothing. Just a gust of wind.

1014
01:19:45,763 --> 01:19:47,146
Didn't bother us at all.

1015
01:19:48,657 --> 01:19:50,436
We're fine. We'll keep on watching.

1016
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:52,141
Afraid?

1017
01:19:52,165 --> 01:19:52,938
Uh-uh.

1018
01:19:53,701 --> 01:19:55,558
I got the hang of this thing now.

1019
01:19:55,842 --> 01:19:56,671
Storm ahead.

1020
01:20:00,390 --> 01:20:01,512
Sheeta, look in my bag.

1021
01:20:01,581 --> 01:20:02,964
There should be some rope in there.

1022
01:20:03,519 --> 01:20:04,446
OK.

1023
01:20:04,767 --> 01:20:06,826
Let's tie ourselves together.
This storm is gonna be rough.

1024
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:07,913
Good idea.

1025
01:20:11,156 --> 01:20:13,592
The mercury is dropping really fast, mom.

1026
01:20:13,682 --> 01:20:16,431
Blast our luck, boys. What a rotten time for a storm.

1027
01:20:16,562 --> 01:20:17,560
When is sun-up?

1028
01:20:17,681 --> 01:20:18,988
In one hour.

1029
01:20:35,281 --> 01:20:37,159
Wait a minute. Something's not right.

1030
01:20:37,572 --> 01:20:40,607
The sun is coming up in the
wrong place. We're out of position.

1031
01:20:40,694 --> 01:20:44,397
You're right. We're supposed to be heading
east, not north. We're going the wrong way. Captain!

1032
01:20:44,759 --> 01:20:47,023
Huh? What do you mean, we're headed north?

1033
01:20:47,126 --> 01:20:49,287
But the compass needle is pointing east, mom.

1034
01:20:49,452 --> 01:20:51,091
There's something confusing the compass...

1035
01:20:51,164 --> 01:20:52,590
and I want to know what it is!

1036
01:20:52,634 --> 01:20:53,927
There it is! Look!

1037
01:20:54,021 --> 01:20:55,902
There what is? Is it Goliath?

1038
01:20:56,058 --> 01:20:57,180
No, it's a cloud...

1039
01:20:57,350 --> 01:20:59,081
and I've only seen one other like it.

1040
01:20:59,533 --> 01:21:00,654
A cloud?

1041
01:21:01,164 --> 01:21:03,170
It's heading right for us!

1042
01:21:17,257 --> 01:21:17,907
That's it.

1043
01:21:17,979 --> 01:21:20,556
I'm not gonna captain my ship into the eye of a hurricane!

1044
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:24,065
Pull back! Pull back, I tell you! All engines reverse!

1045
01:21:42,158 --> 01:21:44,015
We're being pulled into the center of the storm!

1046
01:21:44,058 --> 01:21:46,017
Sorry, Pazu, we can't help you!

1047
01:21:46,092 --> 01:21:48,067
You have to ride it out. Good luck, sailor!

1048
01:21:53,226 --> 01:21:55,251
I can't get it to turn!

1049
01:21:55,328 --> 01:21:57,395
Put more backbone into it, my boy!

1050
01:21:57,498 --> 01:22:00,359
Dola, the engine can't take it!

1051
01:22:00,438 --> 01:22:02,347
What do you want me to do about it?

1052
01:22:02,387 --> 01:22:03,657
Just do what you can!

1053
01:22:04,759 --> 01:22:06,254
Clouds are breaking up.

1054
01:22:13,061 --> 01:22:14,684
Uhh! It's the ocean!

1055
01:22:27,479 --> 01:22:29,003
Pazu, it's a hurricane!

1056
01:22:29,137 --> 01:22:31,734
I see it, captain! We're going in!

1057
01:22:40,583 --> 01:22:43,390
Wow. It's just like dad said...

1058
01:22:43,548 --> 01:22:45,741
two winds blowing in opposite directions.

1059
01:22:49,602 --> 01:22:52,082
Shiver me timbers! What a powerful storm!

1060
01:22:52,118 --> 01:22:54,615
Mom, it's no use! We'll be sucked in!

1061
01:22:54,710 --> 01:22:57,238
If there's one thing I can't stand, it's a quitter!

1062
01:22:57,309 --> 01:22:59,343
Captain, Laputa's in there!

1063
01:22:59,659 --> 01:23:01,035
Laputa's where?

1064
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:04,495
This is just the kind of storm my father
saw and Laputa's in the middle of it!

1065
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:08,432
It can't be. It'd be smashed to pieces!

1066
01:23:08,479 --> 01:23:09,944
Pazu! Look there!

1067
01:23:09,968 --> 01:23:10,684
Huh?

1068
01:23:13,733 --> 01:23:15,489
My boys, we have a dilemma.

1069
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:17,967
It's Goliath off the port bow!

1070
01:23:27,063 --> 01:23:28,898
We're gonna go into the hurricane.

1071
01:23:28,969 --> 01:23:31,425
My dad made it through alive, and so will we!

1072
01:23:31,814 --> 01:23:34,047
Ready? Brace yourselves, gentlemen!

1073
01:23:34,150 --> 01:23:35,142
Aah!

1074
01:23:39,089 --> 01:23:40,695
Aah!

1075
01:23:46,757 --> 01:23:48,235
We did it! Got 'em!

1076
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:51,273
If we don't turn, we'll hit that storm.

1077
01:23:51,484 --> 01:23:52,577
All ahead full.

1078
01:23:52,601 --> 01:23:53,295
Sir?

1079
01:23:53,446 --> 01:23:56,817
The light is pointing to the center of the whirlwind.

1080
01:23:57,777 --> 01:24:01,216
Laputa is in that storm. I won't retreat.

1081
01:24:01,274 --> 01:24:04,832
Now go straight ahead and that is an order, captain.

1082
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:18,759
Ready, Sheeta? - Yes!

1083
01:24:50,026 --> 01:24:50,920
Huh?

1084
01:27:12,882 --> 01:27:13,507
Huh?

1085
01:27:17,663 --> 01:27:19,250
Sheeta! Hey, are you all right?

1086
01:27:19,699 --> 01:27:20,355
Wake up.

1087
01:27:23,941 --> 01:27:24,820
Mm.

1088
01:27:26,647 --> 01:27:27,229
Look.

1089
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:43,086
Laputa.

1090
01:27:44,389 --> 01:27:45,714
Uhh!

1091
01:27:45,738 --> 01:27:46,408
I'm sorry.

1092
01:27:46,612 --> 01:27:48,091
Here. - Wait a minute.

1093
01:27:48,652 --> 01:27:50,657
It's a very tight knot.

1094
01:27:50,848 --> 01:27:53,462
And... my... uhh!

1095
01:27:53,692 --> 01:27:55,258
My hands are trembling.

1096
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:57,304
Whoa!

1097
01:28:17,393 --> 01:28:19,105
Hoo-hoo!

1098
01:28:19,129 --> 01:28:19,839
Ohh!

1099
01:28:20,157 --> 01:28:21,281
Aah!

1100
01:28:21,409 --> 01:28:22,509
Whoa!

1101
01:28:35,629 --> 01:28:36,836
Pretty birds.

1102
01:28:38,111 --> 01:28:40,146
They must live here, Pazu.

1103
01:28:42,268 --> 01:28:43,063
Huh?

1104
01:28:50,609 --> 01:28:52,471
I think he must be here to meet you, Sheeta.

1105
01:28:52,535 --> 01:28:54,688
But I don't have the aetherium crystal.

1106
01:28:54,997 --> 01:28:56,710
Wait, I've gotta cut us loose.

1107
01:29:14,622 --> 01:29:15,757
Hey, wait!

1108
01:29:16,448 --> 01:29:18,449
You're gonna break that! - Wait!

1109
01:29:18,728 --> 01:29:22,785
Please, Mr.Robot, don't do that. We
won't be able to go home without it.

1110
01:29:39,002 --> 01:29:40,630
It's a bird's nest.

1111
01:29:40,765 --> 01:29:42,315
That's why he's here.

1112
01:29:47,884 --> 01:29:50,864
I'm so happy the eggs are all right, Pazu.

1113
01:29:50,927 --> 01:29:52,737
It must be his job to take care of them.

1114
01:30:00,328 --> 01:30:01,769
He says to follow him.

1115
01:30:01,793 --> 01:30:02,446
How do you know?

1116
01:30:02,471 --> 01:30:04,275
I just know that's what he said!

1117
01:30:17,701 --> 01:30:18,577
Ohh! - Look!

1118
01:30:28,056 --> 01:30:28,992
It's a city.

1119
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:59,357
I can't believe we're inside a building.

1120
01:30:59,444 --> 01:31:00,333
Huh?

1121
01:31:03,592 --> 01:31:05,114
Wow, the walls are invisible.

1122
01:31:05,241 --> 01:31:05,958
Yeah.

1123
01:31:15,208 --> 01:31:16,702
I wonder what happened here.

1124
01:31:17,281 --> 01:31:19,775
This used to be a city of advanced technology.

1125
01:32:18,752 --> 01:32:20,087
It must be a monument.

1126
01:32:20,396 --> 01:32:22,116
I wish I could read what it says.

1127
01:32:24,556 --> 01:32:27,120
Someone left some flowers. Look.

1128
01:32:29,859 --> 01:32:31,631
Did you leave the flowers?

1129
01:32:34,101 --> 01:32:35,889
Hey, that's a different robot.

1130
01:32:40,903 --> 01:32:43,047
It looks like it's been frozen there forever.

1131
01:32:43,738 --> 01:32:44,452
Hey.

1132
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:58,007
They must've been protectors of the garden.

1133
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:01,011
And they've kept on guarding the place...

1134
01:33:01,093 --> 01:33:03,568
even long after all the people have gone.

1135
01:33:16,175 --> 01:33:20,873
Oh! You've picked another flower
for the grave. How kind of you.

1136
01:33:23,348 --> 01:33:24,930
Oh, thank you.

1137
01:33:27,364 --> 01:33:28,794
You must be the only one left.

1138
01:33:29,247 --> 01:33:32,266
It looks like all the other robots
stopped working a long time ago.

1139
01:33:40,785 --> 01:33:41,531
Ha!

1140
01:33:57,683 --> 01:34:00,020
You know what, Sheeta? I bet he's not lonesome at all.

1141
01:34:00,393 --> 01:34:03,403
He's got plenty of friends the animals and the birds.

1142
01:34:03,522 --> 01:34:04,666
He takes care of them.

1143
01:34:21,765 --> 01:34:22,551
This way!

1144
01:34:34,212 --> 01:34:36,444
The army has destroyed this part of the city!

1145
01:34:55,167 --> 01:34:57,836
I sure hope Dola and the boys are all right.

1146
01:34:58,201 --> 01:35:00,450
Me, too. Where are they? Do you see them?

1147
01:35:00,664 --> 01:35:03,692
Wait! There they are! They've got 'em prisoner!

1148
01:35:03,958 --> 01:35:06,066
They've been captured! We've got to help them!

1149
01:35:06,359 --> 01:35:08,067
If we don't, they'll hang 'em from the yardarm!

1150
01:35:08,170 --> 01:35:09,298
What'll we do?

1151
01:35:09,433 --> 01:35:10,246
Come on.

1152
01:35:11,223 --> 01:35:11,849
Hurry!

1153
01:35:13,389 --> 01:35:14,959
Sir! Sir!

1154
01:35:15,938 --> 01:35:18,224
We've managed to break down the wall, general.

1155
01:35:18,545 --> 01:35:21,176
Just a sample of what we found inside.

1156
01:35:21,803 --> 01:35:23,821
The city is full of treasure, sir.

1157
01:35:24,036 --> 01:35:24,841
Mama!

1158
01:35:24,865 --> 01:35:25,663
Whoa.

1159
01:35:26,542 --> 01:35:28,590
Wouldn't you like to have this?

1160
01:35:28,737 --> 01:35:31,320
Well, I've got a different kind of necklace for you!

1161
01:35:31,543 --> 01:35:34,261
Have you radioed a report on Laputa's discovery, Muska?

1162
01:35:34,427 --> 01:35:35,580
I was about to.

1163
01:35:35,707 --> 01:35:38,244
See if you can make it difficult to decode.

1164
01:35:38,504 --> 01:35:40,752
And stop pocketing those jewels, you scum!

1165
01:35:42,944 --> 01:35:46,065
The perfect thing to throw those fools off the scent.

1166
01:36:03,227 --> 01:36:04,706
We're up so high.

1167
01:36:04,806 --> 01:36:06,831
I hope you're good at climbing trees, Sheeta.

1168
01:36:09,041 --> 01:36:10,115
I've got a plan.

1169
01:36:12,217 --> 01:36:13,220
Ohh!

1170
01:36:44,358 --> 01:36:46,218
What a greedy pack of thieves.

1171
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:48,775
We can't let them destroy the garden, Pazu.

1172
01:36:49,624 --> 01:36:51,451
We have to find the aetherium crystal.

1173
01:36:52,975 --> 01:36:54,101
We have to find it.

1174
01:36:54,126 --> 01:36:56,108
It's the only way we can protect the garden.

1175
01:36:56,245 --> 01:36:59,311
I was wondering why all of the
storm clouds just disappeared.

1176
01:36:59,668 --> 01:37:02,648
Then I realized if they hadn't cleared
up the army couldn't have made a landing.

1177
01:37:03,425 --> 01:37:05,403
You think it was because of my necklace?

1178
01:37:05,816 --> 01:37:09,273
I don't know for sure, but I think the
power of the crystal disintegrated that storm...

1179
01:37:09,614 --> 01:37:13,762
and now the castle has awakened from
its sleep for whoever holds the crystal.

1180
01:37:16,408 --> 01:37:19,023
We can't let Muska figure out how to use the crystal.

1181
01:37:19,205 --> 01:37:21,420
If he does. it'll be the end of everything.

1182
01:37:22,039 --> 01:37:26,153
But even if we can get my grandmother's
crystal back how can we use its power?

1183
01:37:27,285 --> 01:37:28,858
The spell, Pazu!

1184
01:37:29,048 --> 01:37:30,359
The spell of destruction.

1185
01:37:30,611 --> 01:37:32,472
Sheeta, it may be the only way.

1186
01:37:32,670 --> 01:37:33,358
Huh?

1187
01:37:43,564 --> 01:37:44,469
We need help over here!

1188
01:37:44,588 --> 01:37:47,160
You, soldier! Go find the general!

1189
01:37:48,585 --> 01:37:49,261
Somebody give us a hand!

1190
01:37:49,368 --> 01:37:51,316
Move now! You heard me!

1191
01:37:55,591 --> 01:37:56,480
Quickly!

1192
01:37:59,973 --> 01:38:01,232
We need to get down there.

1193
01:38:19,697 --> 01:38:20,699
I'll go first.

1194
01:38:20,738 --> 01:38:22,589
Right. Be careful.

1195
01:38:24,712 --> 01:38:28,108
Unh! Aah!

1196
01:38:29,014 --> 01:38:30,763
It's OK aah!

1197
01:38:33,442 --> 01:38:34,154
Unh!

1198
01:38:39,020 --> 01:38:39,793
Aah!

1199
01:38:40,536 --> 01:38:42,426
It's around here somewhere.

1200
01:38:50,808 --> 01:38:51,857
Hmm.

1201
01:38:56,084 --> 01:38:57,847
It should be here. Wait!

1202
01:38:59,499 --> 01:39:00,634
This is it!

1203
01:39:11,464 --> 01:39:12,465
It's the boy!

1204
01:39:12,904 --> 01:39:13,940
Aah!

1205
01:39:14,264 --> 01:39:15,105
Aah!

1206
01:39:16,591 --> 01:39:17,547
Sheeta!

1207
01:39:17,571 --> 01:39:18,829
Stop! Don't shoot!

1208
01:39:21,142 --> 01:39:24,003
Well, well, looks like we caught a little princess.

1209
01:39:24,076 --> 01:39:25,440
Don't hurt her!

1210
01:39:26,855 --> 01:39:27,340
Unh!

1211
01:39:27,389 --> 01:39:28,070
Pazu!

1212
01:39:28,190 --> 01:39:29,218
It came from over here!

1213
01:39:29,329 --> 01:39:30,851
Colonel, what's happening?

1214
01:39:30,942 --> 01:39:32,592
We've found another pirate.

1215
01:39:32,855 --> 01:39:34,936
And there's one more hiding under your feet.

1216
01:39:34,983 --> 01:39:37,148
Yes, sir! We'll get him.

1217
01:39:39,901 --> 01:39:42,172
Sheeta, I'll find you!

1218
01:39:42,395 --> 01:39:43,810
Pazu!

1219
01:39:44,843 --> 01:39:45,502
Huh?

1220
01:39:48,783 --> 01:39:50,157
Is that Pazu?

1221
01:39:50,592 --> 01:39:51,689
Uhh!

1222
01:39:53,232 --> 01:39:54,847
Holy smokes!

1223
01:39:55,108 --> 01:39:56,278
Eww.

1224
01:39:56,584 --> 01:39:57,926
That wasn't me!

1225
01:40:03,203 --> 01:40:05,641
I need the commanding officer! - That way!

1226
01:40:06,841 --> 01:40:08,350
The general's waiting over there.

1227
01:40:08,477 --> 01:40:10,283
Guards, on the double! Now!

1228
01:40:10,315 --> 01:40:11,592
You men, come with me!

1229
01:40:11,617 --> 01:40:12,163
Right away, sir!

1230
01:40:12,187 --> 01:40:12,515
Yes, sir!

1231
01:40:12,591 --> 01:40:13,171
Dola.

1232
01:40:13,195 --> 01:40:14,111
Huh?

1233
01:40:15,264 --> 01:40:15,906
Hmm?

1234
01:40:18,498 --> 01:40:19,027
Hi there.

1235
01:40:19,822 --> 01:40:24,505
Sheeta's been captured. I'm going to save
her. When I cut your ropes. make a run for it.

1236
01:40:33,434 --> 01:40:34,770
Good luck, now, captain.

1237
01:40:35,195 --> 01:40:36,365
Wait a minute, boy.

1238
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:39,580
You'd better take this.

1239
01:40:40,332 --> 01:40:43,165
Huh? Uhh thank you.

1240
01:40:46,181 --> 01:40:48,548
The boy has become a man.

1241
01:40:50,502 --> 01:40:53,125
What do you mean, Muska's destroyed all the radios?

1242
01:40:53,228 --> 01:40:56,223
Sir! He must've done it while
most of the men were outside.

1243
01:40:56,691 --> 01:40:59,074
Several of the guards have been seriously injured.

1244
01:40:59,312 --> 01:41:01,839
We've spotted Muska heading for the black dome below, sir.

1245
01:41:02,021 --> 01:41:04,317
He's not alone. He's got those other two men with him.

1246
01:41:04,484 --> 01:41:07,374
So, Colonel Muska reveals his true nature at last.

1247
01:41:07,692 --> 01:41:09,847
Now find him and arrest him!

1248
01:41:10,006 --> 01:41:11,509
All right, first platoon, move!

1249
01:41:11,583 --> 01:41:13,231
Second platoon, fall in!

1250
01:41:13,294 --> 01:41:15,893
You are to shoot anyone who resists!

1251
01:41:16,129 --> 01:41:18,244
We must find Colonel Muska now!

1252
01:41:37,573 --> 01:41:41,387
Uh, excuse me, Colonel Muska. Where are we?

1253
01:41:41,728 --> 01:41:43,676
We are in the center of Laputa.

1254
01:41:43,740 --> 01:41:45,471
The castle above us means nothing!

1255
01:41:45,550 --> 01:41:50,119
All of Laputa's scientific
knowledge is contained in this chamber.

1256
01:41:55,593 --> 01:41:57,301
You may wait here, gentlemen.

1257
01:41:57,565 --> 01:41:59,168
Colonel, please!

1258
01:41:59,492 --> 01:42:03,228
This is a sacred place where
only royalty is allowed to enter.

1259
01:42:05,072 --> 01:42:08,091
Huh? What's happened here? Uhh!

1260
01:42:08,202 --> 01:42:11,602
These filthy roots don't belong in this chamber!

1261
01:42:14,812 --> 01:42:17,115
Horrible things. I'll have them burned.

1262
01:42:18,167 --> 01:42:19,442
This way. Come!

1263
01:42:32,967 --> 01:42:35,659
There it is! This is it.

1264
01:42:35,885 --> 01:42:36,851
See?

1265
01:42:43,138 --> 01:42:46,179
Not here, too! Aah!

1266
01:42:48,598 --> 01:42:49,739
Roots?

1267
01:43:00,258 --> 01:43:03,247
At last! At last I have found it!

1268
01:43:04,812 --> 01:43:07,656
The largest aetherium crystal ever.

1269
01:43:07,838 --> 01:43:10,722
And the source of all the power in Laputa.

1270
01:43:11,254 --> 01:43:16,625
The amazing thing is this beautiful stone has
been awaiting the return of its king for 700 years.

1271
01:43:16,650 --> 01:43:18,246
Seven hundred years?

1272
01:43:18,532 --> 01:43:22,059
700 years is a long time to be without a king, isn't it?

1273
01:43:26,212 --> 01:43:29,057
It's the black stone, just as the legend says.

1274
01:43:35,031 --> 01:43:36,566
Get away!

1275
01:43:38,777 --> 01:43:40,872
There it is. It's the same.

1276
01:43:42,098 --> 01:43:43,915
Who are you, Muska?

1277
01:43:45,291 --> 01:43:48,380
Yes, my dear. I, too, have an old secret name.

1278
01:43:50,146 --> 01:43:53,393
My real name is Romska Polo Ul Laputa.

1279
01:43:56,101 --> 01:43:58,942
You and I have the same royal ancestors.

1280
01:43:58,986 --> 01:44:00,746
We are both of noble blood.

1281
01:44:00,789 --> 01:44:04,594
But then our ancestors left Laputa
to live on earth. What a mistake!

1282
01:44:13,962 --> 01:44:15,952
The explosives have no effect!

1283
01:44:15,976 --> 01:44:17,393
This is no ordinary stone!

1284
01:44:17,512 --> 01:44:19,792
Then use all of the dynamite we have!

1285
01:44:19,817 --> 01:44:22,135
General. there is no need to do that.

1286
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:23,335
You may come in.

1287
01:44:23,774 --> 01:44:25,171
Where are you, Muska?

1288
01:44:32,484 --> 01:44:33,191
Aah!

1289
01:44:33,369 --> 01:44:34,310
Aah!

1290
01:44:34,954 --> 01:44:35,842
Huh?

1291
01:44:39,885 --> 01:44:41,251
Unh!

1292
01:44:44,766 --> 01:44:46,669
Aaaah!

1293
01:44:50,072 --> 01:44:50,705
Unh!

1294
01:45:00,105 --> 01:45:02,049
Huh? Aah!

1295
01:45:18,482 --> 01:45:23,057
Really, I don't understand why you
hesitate, general. Please come in.

1296
01:45:24,202 --> 01:45:26,759
Blast him! All right, follow me!

1297
01:45:39,544 --> 01:45:41,361
After him, men! Hurry!

1298
01:45:41,424 --> 01:45:43,471
Wait, wait, hold on! Wait a second.

1299
01:45:44,193 --> 01:45:45,544
Just where are you, Muska?

1300
01:45:45,671 --> 01:45:47,553
Please be quiet.

1301
01:45:48,408 --> 01:45:49,090
What?

1302
01:45:49,114 --> 01:45:49,999
Up there!

1303
01:45:51,445 --> 01:45:52,253
Whoa.

1304
01:45:52,467 --> 01:45:54,082
What's going on?

1305
01:45:56,219 --> 01:45:58,007
Hold your tongue, commoner!

1306
01:45:58,126 --> 01:46:00,677
You are in the presence of the king of Laputa!

1307
01:46:00,850 --> 01:46:02,528
The man has gone crazy!

1308
01:46:02,750 --> 01:46:05,610
I thought I would show you an example of Laputa's power.

1309
01:46:05,635 --> 01:46:08,721
We are about to celebrate the
rebirth of the Laputian kingdom.

1310
01:46:09,423 --> 01:46:10,223
Sheeta?

1311
01:46:10,614 --> 01:46:14,136
Prepare yourself for the thunder of Laputa!

1312
01:46:14,547 --> 01:46:16,733
Sheeta, I'm coming. Aah!

1313
01:46:38,066 --> 01:46:42,325
The fire of heaven that destroyed
Sodom and Gomorrah in the Old Testament.

1314
01:46:42,610 --> 01:46:45,916
The Rahmaniya referred to it as Indra's Arrow.

1315
01:46:46,575 --> 01:46:50,602
The entire world will once again
kneel before the power of Laputa.

1316
01:46:51,150 --> 01:46:55,216
I can only say well-done, Muska.
You're a credit to our country.

1317
01:46:55,425 --> 01:46:57,522
As such, you deserve this reward.

1318
01:47:00,895 --> 01:47:01,693
Huh?

1319
01:47:04,124 --> 01:47:07,604
I have really had enough of your incredible stupidity.

1320
01:47:09,042 --> 01:47:10,122
Aah!

1321
01:47:10,441 --> 01:47:11,947
Run, everyone!

1322
01:47:13,152 --> 01:47:14,268
Good-bye!

1323
01:47:41,112 --> 01:47:42,204
Blimey! More robots!

1324
01:47:42,288 --> 01:47:43,618
Yeah, and there's a lot of them.

1325
01:47:43,729 --> 01:47:44,897
Make a run for it!

1326
01:47:49,627 --> 01:47:50,924
Check the flapters!

1327
01:47:50,948 --> 01:47:51,809
OK, mom!

1328
01:47:53,136 --> 01:47:54,495
They're ready to travel!

1329
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:55,989
Time to go, mama!

1330
01:47:56,043 --> 01:47:59,460
Hush up! They don't know we're here!

1331
01:48:06,270 --> 01:48:09,065
Tarnation. Now, where are Pazu and Sheeta?

1332
01:48:09,249 --> 01:48:10,566
Can't leave without 'em.

1333
01:48:11,020 --> 01:48:11,695
Oh!

1334
01:48:12,343 --> 01:48:15,011
You had better be gracious to the new king, dear.

1335
01:48:15,576 --> 01:48:16,544
Ohh!

1336
01:48:17,521 --> 01:48:20,461
You and I will be spending quite a lot of time together.

1337
01:48:23,157 --> 01:48:25,297
Look at the fools.

1338
01:48:26,234 --> 01:48:28,325
Unbelievably stupid!

1339
01:48:28,793 --> 01:48:30,582
Pathetic.

1340
01:48:30,607 --> 01:48:34,625
They simply don't understand. It is useless to fight me.

1341
01:48:51,509 --> 01:48:53,494
Aah! Uhh!

1342
01:48:54,871 --> 01:48:56,005
Aah! Ah!

1343
01:48:58,945 --> 01:48:59,913
Huh?

1344
01:49:03,177 --> 01:49:04,212
Robots!

1345
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:08,930
Aah!

1346
01:49:40,794 --> 01:49:42,887
Sheeta!

1347
01:49:46,726 --> 01:49:50,261
A superior being such as myself has only one option...

1348
01:49:51,072 --> 01:49:52,135
burn them.

1349
01:49:52,945 --> 01:49:55,631
Don't you agree, Princess Lusheeta?

1350
01:49:59,493 --> 01:50:01,034
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1351
01:50:02,909 --> 01:50:04,879
You insolent little brat!

1352
01:50:05,045 --> 01:50:05,998
Uhh!

1353
01:50:09,766 --> 01:50:10,853
Seize her!

1354
01:50:11,892 --> 01:50:12,635
Ahh.

1355
01:50:17,355 --> 01:50:20,088
Be a good girl and give the crystal back.

1356
01:50:20,755 --> 01:50:23,519
Please open up! Please!

1357
01:50:24,471 --> 01:50:25,201
Uhh!

1358
01:50:30,259 --> 01:50:33,117
Sheeta, listen to me. Be reasonable.

1359
01:50:33,165 --> 01:50:35,135
There's no way you can escape.

1360
01:50:35,771 --> 01:50:37,986
Please open! Help me!

1361
01:50:46,730 --> 01:50:47,473
Ah!

1362
01:50:56,606 --> 01:50:57,713
Sheeta!

1363
01:51:08,477 --> 01:51:09,458
Aah!

1364
01:51:12,873 --> 01:51:14,475
Sheeta!

1365
01:51:14,984 --> 01:51:18,616
Pazu? Where are you?

1366
01:51:18,656 --> 01:51:20,617
Sheeta! Over here!

1367
01:51:24,424 --> 01:51:25,313
Sheeta!

1368
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:27,487
You're alive!

1369
01:51:27,511 --> 01:51:28,341
Stand back.

1370
01:51:28,492 --> 01:51:29,644
I'm gonna blast through.

1371
01:51:30,835 --> 01:51:31,636
Here we go!

1372
01:51:31,660 --> 01:51:33,626
No, Pazu! Hurry! Take this!

1373
01:51:33,689 --> 01:51:35,889
Muska's coming! Hurry!

1374
01:51:40,575 --> 01:51:42,559
Here, take it!

1375
01:51:45,515 --> 01:51:47,305
Throw it into the ocean!

1376
01:51:47,754 --> 01:51:48,418
Uhh!

1377
01:51:50,047 --> 01:51:51,342
Aah!

1378
01:51:51,956 --> 01:51:54,859
Better protect that crystal if
you want to see the girl alive.

1379
01:51:54,884 --> 01:51:56,236
Do you hear me?!

1380
01:52:22,969 --> 01:52:24,284
Aah!

1381
01:52:24,940 --> 01:52:27,967
Get up, princess. The game is over.

1382
01:52:34,824 --> 01:52:37,566
How appropriate that we've ended up in the throne room.

1383
01:52:38,098 --> 01:52:39,306
Now get over here.

1384
01:52:39,439 --> 01:52:41,308
This is no longer a throne room.

1385
01:52:41,570 --> 01:52:44,032
This is a tomb for the both of us.

1386
01:52:44,853 --> 01:52:48,691
You see, a king without compassion
does not deserve a kingdom.

1387
01:52:49,072 --> 01:52:51,028
You will never possess the crystal.

1388
01:52:51,749 --> 01:52:54,228
You and I will die here together.

1389
01:52:55,434 --> 01:52:58,494
Now I understand why the people of Laputa vanished.

1390
01:52:58,676 --> 01:53:02,276
There is a song from my home in the
Valley of Gondoa that explains everything.

1391
01:53:02,546 --> 01:53:05,105
It says, "Take root in the ground...

1392
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:07,044
"live in harmony with the wind...

1393
01:53:07,234 --> 01:53:08,911
"plant your seeds in the winter...

1394
01:53:08,959 --> 01:53:11,664
"and rejoice with the birds in the coming of spring."

1395
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:14,478
No matter how many weapons you have...

1396
01:53:14,574 --> 01:53:17,283
no matter how great your technology might be...

1397
01:53:17,456 --> 01:53:20,064
the world cannot live without love.

1398
01:53:24,045 --> 01:53:27,525
Laputa will live. I will return it to life.

1399
01:53:27,596 --> 01:53:30,416
Laputa's power is the dream of all mankind.

1400
01:53:32,474 --> 01:53:34,579
Your ears are next...

1401
01:53:35,182 --> 01:53:37,788
unless you get on your knees and obey me.

1402
01:53:38,169 --> 01:53:40,430
I command you. Give me that stone!

1403
01:53:40,498 --> 01:53:42,293
Stop right there, Muska!

1404
01:53:43,667 --> 01:53:44,844
I've hidden the stone!

1405
01:53:44,978 --> 01:53:47,784
If you do anything to harm
Sheeta you'll never get it back!

1406
01:53:47,998 --> 01:53:49,603
No, Pazu! Listen!

1407
01:53:49,865 --> 01:53:52,648
Run away before he kills you as well as me!

1408
01:53:52,759 --> 01:53:53,704
Look who's here.

1409
01:53:53,778 --> 01:53:55,746
Why don't you give me the stone, and the girl will live.

1410
01:53:55,863 --> 01:53:57,334
Otherwise, I'll kill her.

1411
01:53:57,953 --> 01:54:00,084
Are you planning on fighting me?

1412
01:54:00,274 --> 01:54:03,165
Go ahead. Use that cannon you can hardly lift.

1413
01:54:04,118 --> 01:54:06,510
You can have the stone if you let me talk to Sheeta.

1414
01:54:06,558 --> 01:54:09,735
No, Pazu! Get out of here and throw the crystal away!

1415
01:54:10,577 --> 01:54:12,563
I'll give you one minute, starting now.

1416
01:54:28,690 --> 01:54:30,487
Ohh, Pazu!

1417
01:54:34,681 --> 01:54:37,182
Sheeta, listen to me very carefully.

1418
01:54:37,780 --> 01:54:39,376
Whisper the spell to me.

1419
01:54:41,259 --> 01:54:42,892
I'll say it with you.

1420
01:54:43,666 --> 01:54:45,895
Just put your hand in mine and trust me.

1421
01:54:55,679 --> 01:54:58,094
Dola and the boys are free. Don't worry about them.

1422
01:55:02,707 --> 01:55:04,879
Time's up. What is your answer?

1423
01:55:12,532 --> 01:55:13,278
Huh?

1424
01:55:16,916 --> 01:55:17,854
Balus.

1425
01:55:19,944 --> 01:55:22,519
Aah!

1426
01:55:23,261 --> 01:55:25,648
Aaah!

1427
01:55:46,257 --> 01:55:49,037
Aah! My eyes!

1428
01:55:49,160 --> 01:55:51,245
I can't see!

1429
01:55:58,685 --> 01:56:01,670
No! No!

1430
01:56:11,379 --> 01:56:13,414
We can't wait anymore, mom!

1431
01:56:13,576 --> 01:56:15,701
All right, then. Let's shove off!

1432
01:56:16,161 --> 01:56:17,487
Hurry Up!

1433
01:56:28,399 --> 01:56:31,123
Look at that! The whole thing's collapsing!

1434
01:57:21,812 --> 01:57:24,066
Poor kids, I'll really miss them.

1435
01:57:24,941 --> 01:57:27,099
They used the spell of destruction.

1436
01:57:27,765 --> 01:57:30,892
They saved Laputa from the evil hands of Muska.

1437
01:57:42,270 --> 01:57:45,478
Mother look! What is that big blue light up there?

1438
01:57:45,830 --> 01:57:47,463
It's a big stone

1439
01:57:53,799 --> 01:57:56,308
That tree is getting away with our treasure.

1440
01:57:56,411 --> 01:58:00,660
Get it! Get it! Move! Come on you stupid little weirdos!

1441
01:58:32,812 --> 01:58:33,612
Sheeta?

1442
01:58:38,224 --> 01:58:39,314
Pazu!

1443
01:58:44,699 --> 01:58:46,455
Looks like these roots saved us.

1444
01:59:03,112 --> 01:59:04,912
It looks fine, it should work.

1445
01:59:05,139 --> 01:59:05,704
Ready?

1446
01:59:05,919 --> 01:59:06,419
Ready!

1447
01:59:07,128 --> 01:59:07,899
Now!

1448
02:00:12,793 --> 02:00:15,970
What's going on here? It's getting away from us.

1449
02:00:16,183 --> 02:00:19,334
Why the deuce aren't we gaining altitude?

1450
02:00:19,724 --> 02:00:23,264
There's just too much weight to gain alt...

1451
02:00:27,095 --> 02:00:28,999
Sheeta!

1452
02:00:29,093 --> 02:00:31,471
Yeah!

1453
02:00:35,901 --> 02:00:37,407
Dola!

1454
02:00:37,662 --> 02:00:39,462
Thank goodness you're alive.

1455
02:00:39,567 --> 02:00:41,567
So are you! This is great.

1456
02:00:41,592 --> 02:00:45,512
No it's not! My poor little ship is gone forever.

1457
02:00:46,483 --> 02:00:49,922
Stop it a-cryin' you big baby! I'll get you another ship.

1458
02:00:50,631 --> 02:00:55,347
Oh poor little thing, Nothing worse
than having your pigtail shove off.

1459
02:00:55,842 --> 02:00:57,429
What have you got under there?

1460
02:00:57,499 --> 02:01:01,566
Oh my fault, You must have hurt yourself on these.

1461
02:01:01,724 --> 02:01:03,696
Now how'd they get inside my blouse?

1462
02:01:06,443 --> 02:01:08,551
All good pirates listen to their mom.
