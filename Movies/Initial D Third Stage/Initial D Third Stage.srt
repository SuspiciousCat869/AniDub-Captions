Sorry, I can't.

Didn't you already
eat your lunch?

13
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:10,166
Hey!

14
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,000
Takumi!

15
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,208
Over here!

16
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,375
--Hey, man.
--Oh, hey, Itsuki.

17
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:14,916
So what's up?

18
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,875
With what?

19
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,125
What do you mean 'with what'?

20
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,916
I'm talking about
your ride, dude!

21
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,750
Oh... I don't know.
It's fine, I guess.

22
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:24,125
It runs differently, but I can
still drive at my own pace.

23
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,250
I thought... you said it was

24
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,625
a real pain
to drive that thing

25
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,958
after the whole engine
being swapped out incident.

26
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,875
Yeah, once the
tachometer was installed

27
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,916
it all changed
pretty drastically.

28
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,958
Still, that car is
one fast machine.

29
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,500
Brother, I would
kill to say the same

30
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,958
thing about my car
at least once in my life.

31
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,375
Until then, what about giving
me a ride on the mountain pass.

32
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,208
Sure.

33
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,333
If you try not to freak out.

34
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,666
What's that supposed to mean?

35
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,291
That you'll probably faint.

36
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,000
Dude, I would not!

37
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,250
I'm tougher than you!

38
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,833
See! See!

39
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,791
Oh, Takumi.

40
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,083
Thank you for your business!

41
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,083
Takumi, what are
you two checking out?

42
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,458
I, uh...

43
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,041
Yeah, I was wondering if
I could ask you a question.

44
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,333
Sure, whatcha got?

45
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,708
I've been watching
you for a while and I wanted

46
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,166
to know how you
learned so much

47
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,208
about the ins and
outs of mechanics.

48
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,500
How, and I guess you mean
other than working in here.

49
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,208
Well, I guess I tinkered on
motorcycles a lot in high school

50
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,833
with a couple of my buddies.

51
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,375
But once I got my own car,

52
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,708
it became a whole lot more fun,

53
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,041
just knowing that the
entire machine was mine.

54
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,625
Honestly, I think
I became familiar

55
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,291
with the whole idea of
mechanics before I even knew it.

56
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,625
You seem pretty
interested in the

57
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,000
mechanics side of things too,
aren't you Takumi?

58
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,208
No.

59
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,625
But I've realized something.

60
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,041
Or at least I'm starting to.

61
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,375
It's like this...

62
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,291
...after the tachometer
was installed and the

63
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,625
engine was revved up
higher, it was like it

64
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:13,333
changed the
characteristics of the car.

65
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,416
I didn't expect that a
mechanical change would

66
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,500
affect the driving
style that much.

67
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,250
It just proved to me
once again that there's

68
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:22,166
only so much a driver
alone can really do.

69
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,041
Once I realized this, I knew
I had a lot more to learn.

70
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,916
It might not mean
much to anyone else,

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,333
but at least I understand it.

72
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,166
Takumi's finally woken up!

73
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,041
Now this is real progress!

74
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,291
You're not telling lies.

75
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,041
I mean, until everything
went down this summer he

76
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:43,000
didn't even know the car he
drove was called an Eight-Six.

77
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,208
But after that
magnificent debut on Akina's

78
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,458
downhill he kept
winning race after race.

79
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,750
It was like he was
an untouchable giant.

80
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,458
And to think of all
we had to go through,

81
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:52,875
dragging him out to that race.

82
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,916
It was like running across oil.

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,958
You got that right.

84
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,625
But when I look back on it now.

85
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,125
It is a good memory.

86
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,291
Makes me smile.

87
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,333
Too bad I never liked battles.

88
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:21,125
He's not even braking
on the hairpin turn?

89
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,166
What did he just do?

90
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,041
You're telling me
that I don't have

91
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,041
any choice but to
accept the challenges?

92
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:37,000
I don't think
I like that at all.

93
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
No way.

94
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,000
He's moving in from the outside?

95
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,958
I'm in for any kinda race.

96
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,666
Even a gum tape death match.

97
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,000
The less I steer the faster
I can clear those corners.

98
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,333
I don't get it!

99
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,083
I've got the better car
and he's still passing me!

100
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,541
Damn!

101
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,958
This is my battle tonight
and this is my race,

102
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,750
so I'm going to run it my way.

103
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,000
We can't win.

104
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,458
We're up against a monster
that outclasses us in every way.

105
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,916
He's improving,
one race after another.

106
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,833
Listen...

107
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,875
I don't think I'm a
faster driver than you are.

108
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,291
I really don't.

109
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,916
Look...
Whether you think it or not.

110
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,875
You were the faster driver.

111
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,958
Catch you later.

112
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,750
Takumi's getting
better all the time.

113
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,625
I don't think I've ever seen
anyone improve as fast as him.

114
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,791
He's been one devoted driver
lately, and I can't blame him.

115
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,208
It certainly is paying off.

116
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,583
A white FC.

117
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,416
Check it out!

118
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,833
Can I help you, sir?

119
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,166
You sure can.

120
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,541
Fill up the tank and
make it high octane.

121
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:42,875
You got it.

122
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,500
Holy crap.

123
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,208
That's the White Comet of Akagi.

124
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,416
Ryosuke Takahashi.

125
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,000
Filling it with
high octane, sir.

126
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,500
I have something that I'd
like to talk to you about.

127
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay.

128
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,625
Do you have any free
time after work tonight?

129
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,208
Sure, but... What's this about?

130
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,708
Listen, man.

131
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,958
if you don't have time to
spare today, we can do it later.

132
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,916
No, it's not a problem.

133
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,166
I don't have any plans
once my shift is over.

134
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,500
Sounds great.

135
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,708
Then when you get out of
here, just give me a call.

136
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,208
This is my cell number.

137
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,125
Yeah.

138
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,333
Okay.

139
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,291
Cool.

140
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,125
I'll be expecting you.

141
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,458
Thank you for your business!

142
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,708
Dude!
What the heck was that?

143
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,166
Ryosuke Takahashi!

144
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,916
What was a guy like that
doing here talking to you?

145
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,916
I'm not really sure, man.

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,375
Yeah?

147
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,833
Then maybe you wanna tell me
why you're blushing, dude?

148
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,166
I'm not blushing,
it's just, he's who he is,

149
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,708
and I'm here in my little
bow tie and tucked in shirt.

150
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,708
I just get nervous when
he's around, okay.

151
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,166
You mean an expeditionary team?

152
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,041
That's what I said.

153
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,916
I want to gather a small
number of highly skilled drivers

154
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,625
from this area and
I want you to take them

155
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,250
to mountain passes
outside this prefecture.

156
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,708
Then, you challenge the locals.

157
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,958
If they have a record,
it's your job to break it...

158
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,583
...leave behind
an area legend...

159
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,625
...and then disband.

160
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,875
Unfortunately I don't
have a lot of time left.

161
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,166
Maybe a year.

162
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,541
Maybe more, if I'm lucky.

163
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,375
And I gotta be honest with you.

164
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,166
I want to see the end of the
game before that day gets here.

165
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,875
So I'm gonna cut
to the chase, alright?

166
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,333
I need your technique.

167
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,750
What?

168
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,666
Would you join my expeditionary
team as one of the drivers?

169
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,250
Are you kidding?

170
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,791
You're the person who stopped
my consecutive win record.

171
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:49,541
Now, of course, this is my game,
but if you cooperate with me,

172
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,583
I know I can make it a very
rewarding experience for you.

173
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,166
Rewarding?

174
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,125
Up to now you've
been relying mostly on

175
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,333
your talent and your
senses to guide you.

176
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,666
But before too long...

177
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,875
...you're gonna
run head first into

178
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,625
something like a brick wall.

179
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,708
To overcome that
wall, to make it to a

180
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,791
higher level of racing,
you'll need driving skills

181
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,375
that are based on sound theory,

182
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,875
not just the raw instinct
you were born with.

183
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,583
Haven't you begun
to realize you need

184
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:13,916
more than you're working with?

185
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,125
That if you want
to drive faster,

186
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,666
it's knowledge that's
gonna get you there.

187
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:21,250
The only reason
I know this is because

188
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,750
you're exactly like my brother.

189
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,291
You're the same
type of driver as he is.

190
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,375
Wait, you mean Keisuke?

191
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,333
Out there, when
you have your talent

192
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:33,083
backed up by some sound theory,
you'll be an unbeatable warrior.

193
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,416
I can teach you everything
that you want to know.

194
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,708
But it's best to learn all of
that in a racing environment.

195
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,000
Not a classroom.

196
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,041
Not standing here.

197
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,291
So let's do this together.

198
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,583
You don't have to answer now.

199
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,166
Take some time
to think about it.

200
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,166
Just not too long.

201
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,875
Okay.

202
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,708
I hope it's a 'yes' kid.

203
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,500
What?

204
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,458
Dude!

205
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,083
Ryosuke Takahashi
himself invited you of all

206
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,458
people to join his
expeditionary team?

207
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,041
Whoa.

208
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,416
He told me that it's some kind
of special expeditionary team

209
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,750
he's putting together to
race outside the prefecture

210
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,625
but itt'l only gonna
last for a year.

211
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:24,708
That's awesome!

212
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:25,791
Sweet!

213
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,458
This is the best
news I've ever heard!

214
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:28,750
I wanna tell Iketani now!

215
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,083
I have to!

216
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,916
I can't wait to see the
look the look on his face.

217
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,916
Please don't go
stirring up any trouble.

218
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,416
I haven't even decided if
I'm even joining it or not.

219
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,000
Dude!

220
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,625
What's there to think about?

221
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,750
Join!

222
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,541
I don't know.

223
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,833
My first battle was just at the
beginning of this summer.

224
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,416
I mean, it hasn't
been six months.

225
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,458
I'm only now getting
interested in cars.

226
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,083
Everything inside
me is wondering

227
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,291
if I even deserve to
be on the team.

228
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,958
Have I earned it?

229
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,458
What is flying
out of your mouth?

230
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,500
You've been driving around,
delivering tofu since you

231
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,125
were in what, the seventh grade?

232
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,041
So I'd say, yeah,
you've earned it.

233
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,833
Cut yourself some slack.

234
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,416
Oh, man.

235
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,250
I'd kill to join with you, even
if I was just a gofer, you know.

236
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,833
I'd make coffee runs.

237
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,875
Ah, this sucks!

238
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:13,958
Totally sucks!

239
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,458
My rival keeps
pulling farther ahead

240
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,791
and here I am
just standing still!

241
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,208
Every since we
talked last night,

242
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,166
I've been pretty confused,
ya know?

243
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,750
I feel like there's
a few things that I

244
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,750
have to do before
I can join the team.

245
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:29,041
It's the only way I can
do it with a clear head.

246
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:33,791
Killer.

247
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,333
So that's why Ryosuke
wanted to see him?

248
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,541
To invite him onto
a special team?

249
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,958
Yeah.
It's big.

250
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,833
Kinda freaked me out.

251
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,250
Well...

252
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,916
...he's easily the most
charismatic of the road racers.

253
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,375
No one else comes close.

254
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,958
No one.

255
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,083
And with his record, that guy
is king of the mountain pass.

256
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:50,791
Then again...

257
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,250
It was Takumi who beat
him on the mountain,

258
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,916
so with the two of
them on the same team,

259
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,625
you could end up
with something really tight,

260
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,166
or it could blow
up in their faces.

261
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,791
But you never really know.

262
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:00,791
Hold up.

263
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,166
Y'know, I just
thought of something.

264
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,000
Takumi is considered
the hero of Akina.

265
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,958
The guy could be a
legend if we give him time.

266
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:12,375
Don't you feel like the Red Suns
are stealing him away from us?

267
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:13,875
I mean--

268
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:14,958
Nah. I think it's a
good idea to support

269
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,625
Takumi in whatever
he chooses to do.

270
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,541
If it makes him a
better driver in the end,

271
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,916
then that's all that really
matters, isn't it?

272
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,708
Think of it like
Takumi's off training

273
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:26,375
for a year with
Ryosuke Takahashi.

274
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,250
Expeditionary team, huh?

275
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,458
That's a thought he and
I had kicked around before.

276
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,000
It's good training.

277
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,166
I think he should do it.

278
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,541
Takumi isn't the
kind of kid who'd

279
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,833
be satisfied staying
in Akina forever.

280
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,666
A blown engine
means instant defeat.

281
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:37,958
Hello?

282
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,750
Yeah, it's me.

283
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,041
Sorry to bother you with this.

284
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,083
It's got nothing to do with the

285
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,833
stuff we talked
about last night.

286
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,000
I mean, it's not like it's

287
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,208
completely unrelated,
but anyway.

288
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,791
I just...

289
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,791
I wanted to know something, and
I figured you had the answer.

290
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,666
The leader of the Emperor team?

291
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,583
Well, that'd be Kyoichi Sudou.

292
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:58,916
Okay great.

293
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,125
And do you have any idea
where I could find him or

294
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,125
how I could get
in touch with him?

295
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,291
Yeah, of course, I do.

296
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:05,833
Sudou and I go way back.

297
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,625
I can get in touch with
him whenever I need to,

298
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,375
and I can do the same for you.

299
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,000
I, uh...

300
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,791
I really want to
race with him when

301
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,291
the chance comes back around.

302
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,250
All right.

303
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,083
And where do you wanna do this?

304
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:22,291
If it's possible I want to
race on his home turf.

305
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,333
The Iroha Slopes, in Nikko.

306
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,750
You can find Sudou there.

307
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,291
I hope you realize
how tough it'll

308
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,166
be to beat him
on his own course.

309
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,875
The kid might be timid but he's
got the instincts of a fighter.

310
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:51,333
I like the idea of meeting the
enemy on his own grounds.

311
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,666
But above everything
else, he's still gotta be

312
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,583
able to drive faster
than the other guy.

313
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,750
Fujiwara Tofu Shop.

314
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,083
What can I do for you?

315
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,875
Hey Mr. F, it's Itsuki.

316
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,958
Oh, you're looking for Takumi.

317
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,750
He's not here right now.

318
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:13,750
He's not?

319
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,208
So, then he took
the car with him?

320
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,333
But where'd he go?

321
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,666
Did he say?

322
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,125
Sorry, kid.

323
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,666
I've got no idea.

324
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,916
So this is the Iroha Slopes.

325
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,666
I thought it was weird
that there were two roads

326
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,458
with the same name on the map.

327
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:51,916
But now that I'm out here,
wheels to the asphalt, I get it.

328
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,458
Each lane up and
down the mountain is

329
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,375
one way and each
one is separate.

330
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,000
I've never driven
a road like this.

331
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,333
I didn't even know they existed.

332
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:21,500
This downhill burn
is unbelievable.

333
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,333
Dude, was that?

334
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,750
Uh-huh!

335
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:28,833
What?
Speak up!

336
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:29,875
I can't hear you!

337
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,375
Dude, check this out.

338
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,625
Eight-Six.

339
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:38,583
Yeah. That's
Ahkina's Eight-Six!

340
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,458
You're screwing with me.

341
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,416
Yeah, alright,
I'll let him know.

342
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,541
Kyoichi, it's a
call from the base,

343
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,416
they said he's moving fast.

344
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,875
He should be up on us soon.

345
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,041
They said it's probably him.

346
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,541
Hey, bro.
Can we talk?

347
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,833
Yeah. Sure.

348
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:02,833
What's up?

349
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,291
Someone was kind
enough to tell me

350
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:07,708
that Akina's Eight-Six was
heading to the Iroha Slopes.

351
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:08,750
Okay.

352
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,208
Figures.

353
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,000
And you already knew this?

354
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,125
Yeah, sort of.

355
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,708
Is he out for revenge or what?

356
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,416
I mean what is this
all about anyway?

357
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,791
I can't tell.

358
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,000
When I spoke to him about it,
he didn't seem that

359
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,250
concerned about winning
or losing a battle.

360
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,375
Must be something, else.

361
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,375
Takumi went to
the Iroha Slopes to

362
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,583
prove something to someone.

363
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,791
Here he comes.

364
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:51,708
The Eight-Six sounds
different than last time.

365
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:53,958
A while back...

366
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,583
I heard about this little
shop over in Shibukawa.

367
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,458
Not many people
knew about it at the time,

368
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,291
but it had picked up
a very strange engine

369
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,208
from a shall-we-say
'unofficial' source.

370
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,625
Yeah yeah, what
kind of an engine?

371
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,125
Well, it's not
around any longer,

372
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,416
but there used
to be this touring

373
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,541
car race category
called Group A.

374
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,791
You ever recall hearing
something like that?

375
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:14,791
You're telling me that the
Eight-Six has a Group A engine?

376
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,291
More than likely.

377
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,708
If it's an engine built by
TRD, which was in

378
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,041
the AE-101 of Group A,

379
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,791
then it can produce
two hundred forty hp.

380
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,500
At above eleven thousand
rpm out of its one point

381
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:29,333
six liter Natural
Aspiration engine.

382
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,500
This is an ultra high
performance engine.

383
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,541
It's been detuned
for street use and sits

384
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,916
under the hood
of Akina's Eight-Six.

385
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,666
Whatever...

386
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,375
It's not like it matters
it's a racing engine now.

387
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,458
It's still a one
point six liter NA.

388
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,708
It has its limitations.

389
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,166
It's not magical.

390
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,750
That's true.

391
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,333
So you fixed the Eight-Six?

392
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,208
We did.

393
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,500
I hope I don't have to remind

394
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,291
you what I said back in Akagi.

395
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,750
I told you I'd put off the match

396
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,750
between us until you
got a better car.

397
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,791
One that could actually compete.

398
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,166
That looks like the
same one from before.

399
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,125
It might look like it but this
isn't the same car at all.

400
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,333
If you ask me this is a much

401
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,208
better car than the
one you raced.

402
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,291
So what do ya say?

403
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,208
Will this do the job?

404
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,416
I'm always
interested in settling

405
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,583
an unfinished battle, so yeah.

406
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,833
We'll get this taken
care of right now.

407
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:19,958
Good point.

408
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,000
But what interests
me isn't the power.

409
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,083
it's the cornering.

410
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,208
The sporting ability
will improve drastically

411
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,000
with the installation
of that engine.

412
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,875
And the potentially
superior cornering

413
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,041
performance could
be even more refined.

414
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,166
The levels to which this
will take the sport stagger me.

415
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,500
With the right
combinations of genius

416
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:42,458
and luck it could even equal
Kyo-eechi's misfiring system.

417
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,916
This is a one
round, downhill match.

418
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,750
Once we get down to
the base of the mountain.

419
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,125
You're gonna see three bridges.

420
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,083
The goal is at the
end of the third bridge.

421
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,708
You make it
there first, you win.

422
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,166
Is that simple enough?

423
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,125
You go ahead.

424
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,083
I'll follow.

425
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,458
If you maintain
your lead til you

426
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,750
cross that finish line,
you'll be the winner.

427
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,500
I pass you, I win.

428
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:11,791
That cool by you?

429
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,208
That's not fair.

430
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,125
If you think I'm
putting myself at a

431
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,083
disadvantage by letting
you slide in front,

432
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,708
then you're insulting me.

433
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,500
The Iroha Slopes
are my home course

434
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,750
and you'd do best to
not forget that.

435
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,583
It'd be a slaughter out there
unless I gave you a handicap.

436
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,791
You want this to be fair, right?

437
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:32,291
After this is over we can
argue about it all you want.

438
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:33,958
Let's go.

439
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,833
The Iroha Slopes
downhill is laid out

440
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:45,041
like an autocross course
if it had a steep slope.

441
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,083
No one can defeat Kyoichi.

442
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,958
He learned his
technique in autocross,

443
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:54,625
which made him the master
of slow speed corners.

444
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:26,083
I see it now.

445
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:27,958
The car is running
a little faster.

446
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:30,125
It's not like a turbo,
it has the acceleration

447
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,875
of a mechanically tuned car.

448
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:33,333
But it doesn't
matter how you tune it...

449
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:35,291
It's still just a
little Eight-Six.

450
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:38,583
And I've got three
hundred and fifty HP.

451
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:11,666
That's some unbelievable
high rev on that engine.

452
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,250
Badass attitude.

453
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:14,958
You really think you can
hold your own against my

454
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:18,541
misfiring system with those
kinda back alley tricks?

455
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:40,166
Not like it matters what
kinda car I'm up against,

456
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,458
there's no way I
can lose on this run.

457
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:47,041
Just like Ryosuke rules in
Akagi, I'm the emperor here.

458
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:49,791
I always get what I want!

459
00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:58,833
Man, he's right on my bumper.

460
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:02,416
I'll have to go at it harder
if I'm gonna pull this off.

461
00:25:06,791 --> 00:25:08,625
The slope's about
to level out on him.

462
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:11,000
His Eight-Six is
gonna lose some speed.

463
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:12,583
When that happens,
he'll be stuck right in

464
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:15,958
the crosshairs of
my counterattack.

465
00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:25,250
The biggest pitfall
of this course

466
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:27,125
is that once you've driven
through the slow corners,

467
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:28,958
your senses have
trouble readjusting

468
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:30,375
to the high-speed corners.

469
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:32,458
It's the kind of
optical shift that'll trip up

470
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:34,666
even the most
experienced road racers.

471
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,458
And while it might just
be a natural reaction,

472
00:25:36,541 --> 00:25:38,416
in the right hands,
it can be manipulated

473
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,041
as an excellent technique.

474
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:43,125
No one can switch to the
high-speed mode there.

475
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:48,250
No one that is,
except one person.

476
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:51,916
The White Comet of Akagi,
Ryosuke Takahashi.

477
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,333
He's the one.

478
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:08,250
A bridge!

479
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,916
The goal is up ahead!

480
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,750
The steep slope ends
just before the first bridge.

481
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:14,875
You're gonna need
some real power now.

482
00:26:14,958 --> 00:26:17,625
'Cuz Kyoichi Sudou is about
to blow the doors off that

483
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:19,625
Eight-Six of yours
and make you regret you

484
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:22,750
ever came back
asking for seconds.

485
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,375
The second bridge.

486
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:45,458
The right bend fires
you out like a bullet--

487
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:47,541
a scary feeling
after having gotten used to

488
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:49,416
the slow speed section before.

489
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,875
It's gotta be jarring for
someone who's never done it.

490
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:53,958
And then there's an optical
illusion on the bend,

491
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:56,083
making the road
look narrower than it is.

492
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:58,208
Like you can't approach
the outside enough.

493
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:01,458
So I just poke my
nose out a bit, and...

494
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:04,291
This match is mine.

495
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:08,875
The third bridge.

496
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:10,666
The inside and outside positions

497
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,125
will be reversed on the bridge.

498
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:14,583
It's my trademark finish.

499
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:18,833
Once we're driving side by side,
this whole thing'll be over.

500
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:19,666
There it is!

501
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,625
Should I do it?

502
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,375
Go!

503
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:24,583
You gotta death wish?

504
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:25,958
You're going too fast!

505
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:27,750
You can't turn at that speed!

506
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:28,791
Come on.

507
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:30,583
Turn, Eight-Six,
you can do it, baby.

508
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:32,333
Turn!

509
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:35,375
I don't know if I can hold it!

510
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,416
The key point in the battle
is the switch in positions

511
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,041
during that left bend
before the third bridge.

512
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:54,458
No way an ordinary Eight-Six
coulda make that turn.

513
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:56,166
And there's no way
in hell a driver with

514
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,291
normal senses
would dive into it.

515
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:01,375
Were you positive it would work?

516
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:02,458
Yeah.

517
00:28:02,541 --> 00:28:04,541
I usually see it first.

518
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:06,958
Even in the moment I was
somehow able to visualize

519
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:09,416
the line the outside tires were
going to follow on the turn.

520
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,166
I couldn't tell ya how.

521
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,250
I thought I'd be able to
clear it at the very edge,

522
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,333
so I didn't step on the brake.

523
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:15,833
I just let it go.

524
00:28:15,916 --> 00:28:17,416
I guess I can't
explain it very well,

525
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,625
but this kinda thing
happens to me all this time.

526
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:21,166
When I can see it, I can go.

527
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,166
It's just an instinct I follow.

528
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,291
Okay.

529
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:26,375
It's a weird ride
you got there, man.

530
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:28,958
Not the kind of thing just
anybody can master.

531
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:32,083
But I have to admit
it's a good car.

532
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:33,583
You really think so?

533
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:35,166
You beat me, didn't you?

534
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,583
See ya when I see ya.

535
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:43,250
I am glad it all worked out.

536
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:45,958
But I don't feel like I won.

537
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:48,416
If I had to call this one.

538
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,958
I'd say it's a tie.

539
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:57,625
Need me to get
you some toothpicks to

540
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:59,875
keep those eyelids
of yours open?

541
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:02,083
You were out pretty
late last night.

542
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:03,750
Where'd you go?

543
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:06,708
Iroha.

544
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:07,458
Dad.

545
00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:08,958
I gotta be honest.

546
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:11,208
This kinda thing's probably
gonna start to be a problem.

547
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:15,375
You know, me getting back home,
like right before I have to

548
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:17,000
go back out on deliveries.

549
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:18,416
As long as you're
here in time for

550
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,791
the first run,
it's not a problem for me.

551
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:22,666
Anyway, here you go.

552
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:24,625
Thanks.

553
00:29:25,416 --> 00:29:27,250
I don't want you
dozing off and ruining

554
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,500
that tofu so remember
to concentrate on

555
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:31,500
not spilling the
water in the cup. Got it?

556
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:33,166
Yeah, dad, I know.

557
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,125
Well, I'm outta here.

558
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:59,333
That's Keisuke.

559
00:30:04,791 --> 00:30:06,208
Takumi.

560
00:30:06,291 --> 00:30:08,875
Heard about you racing that Evo
Three on the Iroha Slopes.

561
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:10,250
That was only a
couple hours ago.

562
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:11,708
How could you know about that?

563
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:14,541
When something that good
happens, it spreads fast.

564
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:16,958
You know, winter's
moving in before long.

565
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:19,000
And once all of
the ice she dumps on us

566
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,458
melts away and spring gets here.

567
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:23,375
ihe expeditionary
team we've been

568
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:26,708
planning will finally
become fully active.

569
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:27,833
Tell me, Takumi.

570
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:29,958
Plan on joining the team?

571
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:34,708
If my brother only plans on
running this thing for a year,

572
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,583
then I want to spend that
year doing everything in

573
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:38,541
my power to help
him realize his dream.

574
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:40,500
I know he'd do the same for me.

575
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:42,583
He's been devoted
to this game for as long

576
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:47,125
as I can remember, but there's
something he's still chasing.

577
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:48,958
And I have to know what that is.

578
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:50,916
After my brother
trains you for a year,

579
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,208
you'll be faster than you
can even comprehend.

580
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:57,250
But my plan is to
train myself and

581
00:30:57,333 --> 00:31:00,291
make sure that I can get
even further than that.

582
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:04,583
Until that day, the rematch
between us is postponed.

583
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:07,000
When the year's over,
I'll grind you into the dirt

584
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:09,500
and then I'm gonna give
it a shot at turning pro.

585
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:13,375
The major arena hasn't seen
anything as big as me before.

586
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,791
Come with me.

587
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,500
We could do this thing together.

588
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:32,250
Wow.

589
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:37,250
Now that's a truly
incredible group of people.

590
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:39,958
What?

591
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:41,541
You're kidding, right?

592
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:42,541
Not a chance!

593
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:43,750
It was a one round.

594
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:45,166
A downhill neck breaker on

595
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,333
the Iroha Slopes against
Kyoichi Sudou! of the Emperors!

596
00:31:48,416 --> 00:31:50,083
Well?
Know who won?

597
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:52,666
Takumi told me it was a tie.

598
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,833
He said they tied?

599
00:31:53,916 --> 00:31:55,375
Yeah.

600
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:56,958
But it sounded like it was a
good thing, I mean he was happy.

601
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,833
That's right.
And he should be.

602
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:01,250
Everybody knows
that Sudou is fast.

603
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:03,000
Besides this was
his home course.

604
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:04,500
He shoulda had it.

605
00:32:04,833 --> 00:32:06,000
As for whatever new engine

606
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:07,500
he's got in that Eight-Six,

607
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:11,458
it must truly be one
mind-blowing piece of machinery.

608
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:14,791
Takumi's technique is really
amazing, don't get me wrong.

609
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:16,875
But the fact that his car
can even equal the

610
00:32:16,958 --> 00:32:19,291
potential that the Lancer
Evo has under the hood

611
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:21,916
is big news all
by itself, Itsuki.

612
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,208
Really?

613
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,208
Oh yeah.

614
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:27,333
For the first time, Takumi's
got himself a machine

615
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:29,666
that's gonna be able to
utilize his full potential.

616
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,000
That so rocks.

617
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:34,125
This might be the
beginning of the real

618
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:37,625
legend of Akina's
undefeated Eight-Six!

619
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:40,750
Come on in!

620
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:46,916
High octane.

621
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,708
Make it twenty liters.

622
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:50,083
You heard him, twenty liters!

623
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:50,875
High octane!

624
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:51,708
Comin' right up!

625
00:32:51,791 --> 00:32:53,375
Wait...
hold up a sec.

626
00:32:53,916 --> 00:32:57,083
Let's do... fifteen.

627
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:02,500
You the guy who
drives Akina's Eight-Six?

628
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:03,416
Sorry, fella.

629
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,375
You got the wrong guy.

630
00:33:04,458 --> 00:33:05,500
Who are you?

631
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:06,875
A buddy of mine told
me that I might be

632
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:09,833
able to find the driver
of Akina's Eight-Six here.

633
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:12,125
My name is Kai Kogashiwa.

634
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:15,500
Kogashiwa?

635
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:16,333
No.

636
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:18,291
It couldn't be.

637
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,833
'Kay!
Here I go!

638
00:33:50,791 --> 00:33:52,500
I'm gonna catch it this time!

639
00:33:59,708 --> 00:34:02,333
Don't go too far out
in the water now!

640
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,458
Order up!

641
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:44,750
'Kay.

642
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,708
We're gonna need,
a Fast Burger, small fries,

643
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:48,958
two sweet iced teas
to go, ya got it?

644
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:50,708
Got it!

645
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:59,541
He's not here now, but he'll
be back around five o'clock.

646
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:01,583
Yeah, he said he had
to stop somewhere

647
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,000
and do something important.

648
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:04,125
Okay then.

649
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:05,291
I'll come back later.

650
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:06,750
Excuse me, sir.

651
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:08,791
You said your name
was Kogashiwa.

652
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:11,833
And I am sorry if I'm
mistaken about this but,

653
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:15,208
would you happen to be
related to a Ken Kogashiwa?

654
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:16,958
I guess you could say that.

655
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:18,958
He's my dad.

656
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:22,416
Thank you for your business!

657
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,500
So boss, are you
gonna fill us in?

658
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:26,833
I mean, how did
you know his dad?

659
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:27,833
That was kinda weird.

660
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:29,875
That was Ken Kogashiwa's kid.

661
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:32,541
We know that, but who's
Ken Kogashiwa anyway?

662
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:35,708
It's been quite a long time
since I've heard his name.

663
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:38,916
It's been... Twenty years?

664
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,458
Nah, I guess by this point,
it'd have to be even longer.

665
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:46,500
Bunta and I went around to a lot
of the mountain passes together.

666
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,916
Ken was a rally driver
from the Iroha Slopes,

667
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,500
and a real good one, too.

668
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:52,791
Lotsa people loved him,

669
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:55,375
but he happened to
be Bunta's toughest rival.

670
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,208
His driving was
out of control and

671
00:35:57,291 --> 00:35:58,500
they were at
each others throats.

672
00:35:58,583 --> 00:35:59,958
They raced over and over again.

673
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:01,833
Then, they had their
most decisive match,

674
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:04,250
the one to prove the
best between them.

675
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:05,458
Bunta won.

676
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:07,500
And that was the last
I ever heard of Ken.

677
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,208
Takumi's father was a legendary

678
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:11,791
road racer and
Kogashiwa's rival.

679
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:13,416
It figures.

680
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,583
So his son's grown up and
come here to look for Takumi.

681
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:20,375
We'll have to wait to
see what for, I suppose.

682
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:46,041
There's some skill
behind that wheel.

683
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:47,708
I can barely tell what happened.

684
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:49,083
I know I felt a shock.

685
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:50,458
I'd swear I felt
something electric

686
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,458
when we passed each other.

687
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:56,041
I might not know why
just yet, but that felt good.

688
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:58,166
He's gonna challenge
me to a battle?

689
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,458
If I was betting on it,
that's where I'd put my money.

690
00:37:01,541 --> 00:37:04,125
Yeah, he drove an SW
twenty with Tochigi tags.

691
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:05,458
He's serious, man.

692
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:07,208
It's a midship so its combat

693
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,291
potential out
there is pretty high.

694
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:11,333
And a 'midship' would be...?

695
00:37:11,416 --> 00:37:13,208
I mean is that it has
the engine behind

696
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:14,666
the driver where it should go.

697
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,833
You see, most cars have
the engine up front

698
00:37:16,916 --> 00:37:19,166
but it's reversed
in the midship.

699
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:22,708
With rear wheel drive,
it's better to have

700
00:37:22,791 --> 00:37:24,875
the engine toward
the rear of the vehicle.

701
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:28,000
That way the rear tires don't
skid when you open the throttle

702
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:30,583
and you get better
acceleration at a corner's exit.

703
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:33,000
'Course the agility is,
improved if a

704
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:35,250
heavy engine sits near
the center of the car.

705
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:37,666
And, all Formula One
cars are midship,

706
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,166
but that's pretty
common knowledge,

707
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,125
I'm sure you knew that.

708
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:44,000
Look!
Here he comes!

709
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:48,958
Fujiwara Tofu Shop.

710
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:50,750
What can I do for you?

711
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:51,833
Kogashiwa?

712
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:53,625
Ken Kogashiwa?

713
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:55,000
How you doing pal?

714
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:56,291
It's been way too long.

715
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,666
Good to hear from you.

716
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,500
You haven't called in more
years than I can count.

717
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:03,625
If it isn't the driver of
Akina's Eight-Six.

718
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:05,000
I heard you defeated
Sudou of the

719
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:07,000
Emperor's on the Iroha Slopes.

720
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:08,208
He was my target.

721
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:09,666
You know that?

722
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,583
Everyone in our area
said that annoying

723
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:14,083
Evo Three was unbeatable.

724
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,125
But I was positive
that I could beat him.

725
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:18,916
Then you came along
and stole my thunder.

726
00:38:19,458 --> 00:38:20,875
Thanks for that.

727
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:23,541
And so... as is the
natural order of things,

728
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:24,833
you've become
my next target.

729
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:26,208
You ready for that?

730
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:28,833
I'm here to challenge you.

731
00:38:28,916 --> 00:38:30,875
What do you say?

732
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:37,958
First, I wouldn't say that
I defeated the Evo Three.

733
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:40,833
So if that's what this is about
then you can forget about it.

734
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:42,708
I won't run again.

735
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:47,000
I can't say exactly when,
but I'll be back at the

736
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:50,041
Iroha Slopes before
the snow season begins.

737
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:51,625
Sounds excellent.

738
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:53,791
Can't wait to see you out there.

739
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:56,125
You can call me Kai,
Kai Kogashiwa.

740
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,416
You are?

741
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,958
Takumi Fujiwara.

742
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:01,625
And I'm sorry but I really
gotta get back to work.

743
00:39:01,708 --> 00:39:02,666
Okay.

744
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,500
Sure.

745
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:05,000
Oh, and one more question.

746
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:08,416
Was that you out driving on
Akina just a few hours ago?

747
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,958
No.

748
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:10,750
Oh...

749
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:12,875
...well, have a good one.

750
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:36,166
Hey, is that?

751
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:40,916
What are you
doing out here, Dad?

752
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:44,208
Let's talk.

753
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:48,625
A kid driving a car
called an SW twenty,

754
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:50,166
he stopped by your work to have

755
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,291
a talk with you
today, didn't he?

756
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:53,416
Not too long ago.

757
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,333
How'd you know about that?

758
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:58,333
So...

759
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:00,750
You plan on racing him or not?

760
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:04,833
All I know is I really
don't want to walk away.

761
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,083
Well.

762
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:09,083
You're gonna lose.

763
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:23,041
Pop...

764
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:25,583
I just wanted you to know that
I went to see Akina's Eight-Six.

765
00:40:25,916 --> 00:40:27,083
So that's it.

766
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:30,416
You made up your mind
to race Fujiwara's son?

767
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,291
Huh?

768
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:32,833
You know this kid I'm racing?

769
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:33,708
I do.

770
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:35,791
I've got a lot of connections.

771
00:40:36,416 --> 00:40:38,500
Now, Kai, there's
a strategy when

772
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:40,041
it comes to
defeating this Eight-Six.

773
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:42,333
Now let me tell you what it is.

774
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:47,791
Bye, Natsuki.

775
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:49,833
Cool.
See you tomorrow.

776
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,875
Takumi?

777
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:59,541
Takumi, would you please
quit acting like I don't exist?

778
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:00,583
There's something I'd

779
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:01,666
really like to talk
to you about.

780
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,833
Can you meet me later?

781
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:04,666
Seriously, why me?

782
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,625
Well, we're...

783
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:06,875
I mean, we're friends right?

784
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:08,333
Yeah, I guess.

785
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,833
You told me that we
weren't really going out.

786
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:13,291
I assumed that meant we were
still something like friends.

787
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:16,083
Oh!, I hope that we are and
that I didn't screw this up.

788
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:18,416
So if you are my
friend then tell me this.

789
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,208
Why can't--

790
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:21,208
Takumi, wait!

791
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:23,375
I just want you to talk to me!

792
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,875
I'm sorry but I'm just too busy.

793
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:39,291
Yo!

794
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:40,708
Takumi!

795
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:42,250
So what's the word,
man, when are you

796
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,833
going back to the Iroha Slopes?

797
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:45,583
Show 'em who's boss?

798
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:47,166
I already made up
my mind to do it,

799
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,666
so I figured the
sooner the better.

800
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,250
I mean, it's not like
this is the kind of thing

801
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:52,125
I can put it off forever.

802
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:53,791
So I'll be going tonight.

803
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:56,833
You are joking, right?

804
00:41:56,916 --> 00:41:58,541
No way, I'm serious.

805
00:41:58,625 --> 00:42:01,416
Tomorrow is Saturday, so we
only have half a day of school.

806
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,833
If I don't get much sleep it
won't really mess me up.

807
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:06,125
I do admire that decisive
nature of yours.

808
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:08,125
Have I ever told you that?

809
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:10,750
So what's been going on
with the expeditionary team?

810
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:13,291
Are you gonna join
them or aren't you?

811
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:16,041
At least tell me you gave
the guy an answer already!

812
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:17,791
No, not yet.

813
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:19,291
Huh?

814
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:20,875
It's doesn't matter if I
answer him right now.

815
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:22,625
The team's not gonna
take any real action

816
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:24,458
until spring gets here.

817
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:27,875
I have some time until
then, so I want to sit with it.

818
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:29,916
I just need some time to think.

819
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:31,958
Dude, what for?

820
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:33,666
I want to join them,
don't get me wrong.

821
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:36,666
It's an unbelievable
opportunity and I'm grateful.

822
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:39,208
Ryosuke and Keisuke
are great guys.

823
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:40,208
Both of them.

824
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:41,750
And it's obvious
they've each got

825
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:43,791
a clear goal they're
working towards.

826
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:45,333
Okay.

827
00:42:45,416 --> 00:42:47,916
But there's only one thing I
want to do right now, Itsuki.

828
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,583
And that's drive faster.

829
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:52,708
So...
That's your goal?

830
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:54,000
Huh.

831
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,125
Are you headed out?

832
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:05,500
All right.

833
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,666
He's a tough one.

834
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,041
Good luck.

835
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:10,125
You want me to give you some
advice before you leave?

836
00:43:10,208 --> 00:43:11,375
You never offer advice.

837
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:12,833
What's gotten into
you lately, Dad?

838
00:43:12,916 --> 00:43:14,750
Shut up and listen.

839
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:19,666
I'm only gonna say this once.

840
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:22,666
Your best shot at passing is
going to be on the last bridge.

841
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:23,958
That's when your opponent will

842
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:26,458
be ahead of you so try
and watch for it.

843
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:30,000
But, you don't know
that he's gonna be ahead.

844
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:38,291
Alright.

845
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,416
Listen up.
Now...

846
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,500
Your opponent is Fujiwara's son.

847
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,208
He'll have splendid
technique behind that wheel.

848
00:43:50,291 --> 00:43:52,125
If you're gonna win this,
it'll be important to

849
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:54,625
have not only technique,
but strategy.

850
00:43:54,708 --> 00:43:56,750
And it's strategy
that I can pass on for

851
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:59,583
you to use when
the time's right.

852
00:43:59,666 --> 00:44:02,208
First, you have to
let him get ahead of you.

853
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:04,375
Pop, are you out of your mind?

854
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:05,291
How could I do that?

855
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:07,041
It'd be like giving up!

856
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:08,583
You can't let the
car that might run

857
00:44:08,666 --> 00:44:10,166
faster than you get in front.

858
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:13,458
That's pretty much just asking
for them to kick your ass.

859
00:44:13,541 --> 00:44:15,000
The driver who
plays it straight out there

860
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:18,041
has no chance
at winning this thing.

861
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:20,958
You're right, if you play
it straight you're gonna lose.

862
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:24,458
And that's why you
need a strategy.

863
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:26,416
You should know
sometimes the lines

864
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,750
you need to
follow are inside the

865
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:30,375
inner shoulder
on the Iroha Slopes.

866
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:32,208
That's the line
you want me to take?

867
00:44:32,291 --> 00:44:34,291
Dad, I have no idea
what that'll do to the car!

868
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:35,583
It could screw her up!

869
00:44:35,666 --> 00:44:37,208
Don't think about it, Kai.

870
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:39,541
Passing your opponent
should be as instinctual as a

871
00:44:39,625 --> 00:44:41,666
knock out for a
professional boxer.

872
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:44,166
You need to concern yourself
with this kind of winning.

873
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,500
The obvious kind.

874
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:47,791
The kind everyone can see.

875
00:44:48,416 --> 00:44:50,291
So, listen carefully.

876
00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:52,458
The attack point is
after the mid-section.

877
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:56,333
You have to keep up with him
no matter what until that point.

878
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:06,333
Word is, his father
is one intense trainer.

879
00:45:06,416 --> 00:45:08,541
And somebody was telling me
that back in the day he won a

880
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:11,458
whole boatload of KART,
he was unbeatable.

881
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:13,291
Why is someone
like that bothering

882
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:15,291
to lower himself
to street racing?

883
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:16,500
Shoot.

884
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:18,166
At least he was the
fastest motorcycle rider

885
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:20,041
on the Iroha Slopes.

886
00:45:20,125 --> 00:45:21,458
Oh!

887
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:23,375
Do you remember that guy
Iwaki Seiji of the Emperor team?

888
00:45:23,458 --> 00:45:24,750
Drives that white Evo Four?

889
00:45:24,833 --> 00:45:26,291
I don't think you
liked him much.

890
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:27,416
Yeah.

891
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,666
The pretentious jerk
with the ponytail.

892
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:30,833
How could I forget
such a charmer?

893
00:45:31,166 --> 00:45:33,500
When the Emperor team
first invaded Gunma,

894
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:36,333
he defeated everyone.

895
00:45:36,416 --> 00:45:39,583
Well, Iwaki was owned by
the SW not too long ago.

896
00:45:39,666 --> 00:45:40,625
Couple weeks, maybe.

897
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:43,166
Made him look
like a total loser.

898
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,250
So, it's you again.

899
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:56,583
Don't pucker up, Seiji.

900
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:58,833
I'm not here to mess with
you or any of your boys.

901
00:45:58,916 --> 00:46:00,916
If you can believe it,
I'm just visiting.

902
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,625
I wanted to say hello.

903
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:04,458
That right?

904
00:46:04,541 --> 00:46:07,166
I'm here to race the Slopes
against Akina's Eight-Six.

905
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:08,208
You're what?

906
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:09,583
We can't let another outsider

907
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:11,708
just stroll in here
and defeat us.

908
00:46:11,791 --> 00:46:14,333
I know I can beat
this guy, Sudou.

909
00:46:14,416 --> 00:46:15,583
I'll break your fa--

910
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:17,541
You know, that could be
an interesting match.

911
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:21,125
Akina's Eight-Six going up
against an ex-KART driver.

912
00:46:21,208 --> 00:46:23,333
Hell, I kinda wanna
see what happens.

913
00:46:23,416 --> 00:46:25,083
Don't you?

914
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:34,791
Thanks for showing up.

915
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:35,916
You want to have a warm up run

916
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,333
before we do this
thing for real?

917
00:46:37,416 --> 00:46:39,041
No thanks, I already took one.

918
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:40,166
Got here a little earlier,

919
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:42,583
so I tried to make
the best of my time.

920
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:43,958
Then I'll explain the rules.

921
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:45,791
First, we start
at the same time.

922
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:48,750
The goal is going to be
at the end of the third bridge.

923
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:51,875
Whichever one of us
makes it across first, wins.

924
00:46:51,958 --> 00:46:54,458
Sound like that's gonna work?

925
00:46:54,541 --> 00:46:56,291
Then let's do this.

926
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:01,625
No doubt about it.

927
00:47:01,708 --> 00:47:04,875
That panda Trueno is the
Eight-Six I passed on Akina.

928
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:06,875
When I did, the person behind
the steering wheel had

929
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:08,708
to have been Bunta Fujiwara,

930
00:47:08,791 --> 00:47:11,083
the man who defeated my father.

931
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:12,041
So...

932
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:13,833
...this is his son.

933
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:16,958
He was different at the
gas station when I met him.

934
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:20,416
I didn't sense it then,
but I do now.

935
00:47:22,833 --> 00:47:24,458
He's fast.

936
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:26,083
Man...

937
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:28,666
I can't wait to
see how this turns out.

938
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:33,166
Yeah, cool.

939
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,583
I got it.

940
00:47:34,666 --> 00:47:36,041
They're sayin' both of 'em
got their engines started.

941
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:37,833
It's about time.

942
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,500
Hey Ryosuke.

943
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:51,833
I was told you guys
have an interesting match

944
00:47:51,916 --> 00:47:54,916
going on up here so I
thought I'd come check it out.

945
00:47:55,958 --> 00:47:58,041
You can do whatever you want.

946
00:47:58,791 --> 00:48:00,375
Sure is windy out here tonight.

947
00:48:00,458 --> 00:48:02,500
Didn't expect this.

948
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:08,833
These could be a problem.

949
00:48:08,916 --> 00:48:10,791
At this point, who knows
how many dried up

950
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:12,250
leaves have collected
along the shoulder

951
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:13,833
all the way down the drive.

952
00:48:13,916 --> 00:48:16,125
It might seem like nothing,
but this stuff right here

953
00:48:16,208 --> 00:48:18,875
could be what decides
the outcome of the battle.

954
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:21,791
These leaves are one
thing no one factored in.

955
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:23,750
Of all the
unpredictable factors.

956
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:25,625
Leaves?

957
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:35,500
How you feeling, Takumi?

958
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,041
I wouldn't expect anything much

959
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:37,666
out of my tonight if I were you.

960
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:38,708
What do you mean?

961
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,083
You should have
this all lined out.

962
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:42,291
Didn't your dad have any
words of wisdom for you?

963
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:43,458
Yeah, he said something

964
00:48:43,541 --> 00:48:45,333
but it didn't make
a whole lot of sense.

965
00:48:45,416 --> 00:48:46,458
I don't know.

966
00:48:46,541 --> 00:48:47,583
I'm just gonna get
out there and drive.

967
00:48:47,666 --> 00:48:48,541
What?

968
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:49,500
You're not foolin' us.

969
00:48:49,583 --> 00:48:51,583
We know you got some kinda plan.

970
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:54,958
I'm gonna keep my eyes on
the road and maintain focus.

971
00:48:55,041 --> 00:48:56,458
Good luck, Takumi.

972
00:48:56,541 --> 00:48:57,750
I know you'll be able to wipe
the asphalt with this guy.

973
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:59,750
He is roadkill.

974
00:49:01,916 --> 00:49:03,458
Let's do this!

975
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:07,083
Five!

976
00:49:07,166 --> 00:49:08,041
Four!

977
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:09,208
Three!

978
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:10,250
Two!

979
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:11,125
One!

980
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:13,000
Go!

981
00:49:15,291 --> 00:49:16,458
Did you guys just see that?

982
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:18,458
Takumi was off the line
like a lightning bolt!

983
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:21,416
That's the kinda speed you need
against that loser, Takumi!!!

984
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,791
Incredible.

985
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:25,000
The midship should have
the advantage at the start.

986
00:49:25,083 --> 00:49:28,375
The new engine in
the Eight-Six is unreal.

987
00:49:37,958 --> 00:49:38,916
That sucker is fast.

988
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,541
It's no ordinary Eight-Six.

989
00:49:40,625 --> 00:49:43,791
It's engine is more powerful
than my two-liter Three-S.

990
00:49:44,791 --> 00:49:46,541
Dad compared
passing him to a KO,

991
00:49:46,625 --> 00:49:48,375
and that's exactly
what I wanna do--

992
00:49:48,458 --> 00:49:50,166
knock this guy out.

993
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:51,458
That's all I'm here for.

994
00:49:51,541 --> 00:49:53,708
I will outrun this
speedy little Eight-Six,

995
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:56,416
even if it tears my car apart.

996
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,333
Yeah, cool.

997
00:50:04,416 --> 00:50:05,833
I hear ya.

998
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:09,166
Guys, the Eight-Six
was ahead off the line.

999
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:12,416
So, looks like Kai is nothing
more than a big talker.

1000
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,291
I mean, even Kyoichi here
couldn't beat the Eight-Six.

1001
00:50:15,375 --> 00:50:17,791
And now that he's
ahead, that non-turbo SW

1002
00:50:17,875 --> 00:50:19,500
doesn't have a chance.

1003
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,000
I dunno.

1004
00:50:22,625 --> 00:50:24,625
I was so confident of
my counterattack that

1005
00:50:24,708 --> 00:50:27,666
the closer I got to the goal
the more careless I became.

1006
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:30,541
I wasn't concentrating and
my focus started drifting.

1007
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:32,166
So what?

1008
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:34,166
So I told myself
that I wasn't gonna try

1009
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:35,833
to pull any nasty
tricks and I went

1010
00:50:35,916 --> 00:50:38,000
for a clean run against the guy.

1011
00:50:38,083 --> 00:50:40,333
My biggest weakness
was my own pride.

1012
00:50:40,416 --> 00:50:42,708
But if Kogoshiwa plays dirty
he might actually have

1013
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:44,666
a chance of pulling
this thing off.

1014
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,666
What do you mean by that?

1015
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:48,500
I'm talking about the lines.

1016
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:49,750
You know the ones.

1017
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:52,208
The lines on the Slopes
that only locals know.

1018
00:50:52,291 --> 00:50:53,541
They can be a huge advantage,

1019
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:55,833
but you have to know
how to use them.

1020
00:51:08,208 --> 00:51:11,083
An ex-KART driver will use
his left foot for braking.

1021
00:51:11,166 --> 00:51:13,333
This leaves the right
foot on the gas pedal.

1022
00:51:13,416 --> 00:51:15,166
When he uses
his left foot to brake,

1023
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:17,958
this shifts the load forward
to eliminate understeering.

1024
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:19,958
The brilliance of this
technique is that the driver

1025
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:23,208
can then dive into the
corner at full throttle.

1026
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,750
I wouldn't wanna
be driving this.

1027
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:29,625
There's gotta be a hundred
little details that only the

1028
00:51:29,708 --> 00:51:32,000
locals know about such
a distinctive course.

1029
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:34,000
Kai's gotta have
some kinda plan in his

1030
00:51:34,083 --> 00:51:36,208
back pocket that's
gonna blindside Takumi

1031
00:51:36,291 --> 00:51:37,500
at just the wrong time.

1032
00:51:37,583 --> 00:51:39,416
But Takumi's father
defeated Kai's father

1033
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,541
on this same mountain pass
when they were younger,

1034
00:51:41,625 --> 00:51:42,291
isn't that right?

1035
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:43,500
Yeah.

1036
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:44,833
Takumi mumbled something
about his dad giving

1037
00:51:44,916 --> 00:51:47,250
him some advice but that
it didn't make any sense.

1038
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:48,541
So who knows.

1039
00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:51,500
I have a bad feeling
he's in trouble up there.

1040
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:54,750
I just hope he makes
it down in one piece.

1041
00:52:01,416 --> 00:52:03,708
Leaves are blowing everywhere
and thanks to the wind,

1042
00:52:03,791 --> 00:52:05,958
there are piles of
them scattered all over.

1043
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:07,500
This is tough.

1044
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:10,250
If I roll over even one of them
I'll lose control of my car.

1045
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:12,166
But since the Eight-Six
is in front of me this'll be

1046
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:13,916
even more of an issue for him.

1047
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,666
He has no idea
when he's gonna skid.

1048
00:52:21,916 --> 00:52:23,833
It's so hard to drive tonight.

1049
00:52:23,916 --> 00:52:26,458
I'm better off letting
the car drift itself.

1050
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:29,083
I just gotta skid
the back wheels early

1051
00:52:29,166 --> 00:52:31,541
and then let all
four of 'em drift.

1052
00:52:32,541 --> 00:52:34,791
Wait.
What's that idiot doing?

1053
00:52:34,875 --> 00:52:36,500
No wonder he's
shooting for the leaves.

1054
00:52:36,583 --> 00:52:39,500
A sloppy street
is easier to drift on.

1055
00:52:42,458 --> 00:52:44,875
You're a tough driver
Takumi, but a cheap trick

1056
00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:47,416
like that isn't
gonna work on me.

1057
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,500
Sometimes the lines
you need to follow

1058
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:53,125
are inside the inner shoulder
on the Iroha Slopes.

1059
00:52:53,208 --> 00:52:54,458
If this is going to work.

1060
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:57,041
the timing is
absolutely crucial.

1061
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,583
We're at corner
number thirty-three.

1062
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:02,083
I can hear them.

1063
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:03,791
And it sounds like they'll be
on the hairpin any second.

1064
00:53:03,875 --> 00:53:04,916
Yeah, all right.

1065
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,250
Just call me back
when they get there.

1066
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:08,833
It's about to get interesting.

1067
00:53:08,916 --> 00:53:10,333
What?

1068
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:13,583
I have a bad feeling.

1069
00:53:13,666 --> 00:53:16,041
I don't know what it is, but
he's going to pull something.

1070
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:18,500
Maybe something dangerous.

1071
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,833
I can't wait any longer, Pop.

1072
00:53:26,916 --> 00:53:28,791
It's now or never.

1073
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:32,708
Man, I can't shake
this feeling in my gut.

1074
00:53:32,791 --> 00:53:34,708
Somethings going down.

1075
00:53:35,291 --> 00:53:36,333
Okay.
Here it goes!

1076
00:53:36,416 --> 00:53:38,958
I'll attack him in
corner thirty three!

1077
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:40,458
Hey!

1078
00:53:40,541 --> 00:53:42,000
Here they are!

1079
00:53:44,875 --> 00:53:46,833
I see 'em!
The Eight-Six is in front!

1080
00:53:46,916 --> 00:53:48,333
Here I go!

1081
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,166
What?
What's going on?

1082
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,083
Are you trying to
tell me that the SW

1083
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,750
took the inside
of the inner line?

1084
00:53:57,833 --> 00:53:58,791
He did?

1085
00:53:58,875 --> 00:54:00,708
He actually
passed the Eight Six?

1086
00:54:00,791 --> 00:54:02,375
He already got passed?

1087
00:54:02,458 --> 00:54:03,625
Home court advantage.

1088
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:04,625
Huh...

1089
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:05,708
Well...

1090
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:07,208
...you did it, Kai.

1091
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:08,291
Serious?

1092
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:10,083
The SW already
passed the Eight-Six?

1093
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:11,916
And he pulled it off
in corner thirty three?

1094
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
These two are really
kicking up the heat tonight!

1095
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:15,041
That's a hairpin turn.

1096
00:54:15,125 --> 00:54:16,250
How'd he get through?

1097
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:17,500
Did you guys hear that?

1098
00:54:17,583 --> 00:54:19,416
This is no easy race.

1099
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,166
Come on, Takumi!
You can do this!!

1100
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,041
Sorry about the
surprise there pal,

1101
00:54:57,125 --> 00:54:58,625
but the line
inside the inner shoulder

1102
00:54:58,708 --> 00:55:00,500
is in the air,
not on the ground.

1103
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:03,583
The hairpins up here on the
Slopes have a big height gap.

1104
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:05,791
Sure, some people
might call this cheating.

1105
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:08,916
But it's what we
locals call victory.

1106
00:55:10,375 --> 00:55:12,750
I got this in the bag!

1107
00:55:17,125 --> 00:55:19,625
If this keeps up,
I'm gonna lose!

1108
00:55:26,666 --> 00:55:28,208
So whattya think, bro?

1109
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:29,208
Hard to say.

1110
00:55:29,291 --> 00:55:30,666
Eleven hairpins left.

1111
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:32,833
At this point
it's anyone's match.

1112
00:55:33,166 --> 00:55:35,500
What do you mean
by that, Ryosuke?

1113
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:37,416
So far the race is turning out

1114
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,041
about the way you
thought it would.

1115
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:41,208
But don't you think
your guy made his move

1116
00:55:41,291 --> 00:55:42,916
just a bit too early?

1117
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,750
Making your moves
early in the run like

1118
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:46,583
that gives your opponent
time to recover

1119
00:55:46,666 --> 00:55:49,000
from the shock
of it and compensate.

1120
00:55:49,708 --> 00:55:50,875
We're at corner thirty seven.

1121
00:55:50,958 --> 00:55:52,833
I can see 'em now!

1122
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:58,416
At this rate the gap's
gonna widen even more.

1123
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:05,166
This guy's good.

1124
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:08,208
I better pull the stunt again if
I'm gonna get him off my bumper.

1125
00:56:09,541 --> 00:56:10,500
Dude!

1126
00:56:10,583 --> 00:56:12,125
He jumped!

1127
00:56:12,625 --> 00:56:14,208
Go!

1128
00:56:32,583 --> 00:56:34,916
He managed the
jump on his first try?

1129
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,166
Man...

1130
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:37,208
He might have all the
gut reactions and the

1131
00:56:37,291 --> 00:56:38,583
talent of a
mountain pass driver,

1132
00:56:38,666 --> 00:56:40,750
but once he let me get in
front of him his chance

1133
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:43,041
at winning slipped
right through his fingers.

1134
00:56:43,125 --> 00:56:45,791
I'll keep this pace
until the goal.

1135
00:56:54,833 --> 00:56:57,541
Wait, the line can't be
blocked no matter what?

1136
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:00,083
Nope.

1137
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,291
And you send Takumi out there

1138
00:57:01,375 --> 00:57:03,250
without even
telling him about it?

1139
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:05,500
When you go down
the Iroha Slopes

1140
00:57:05,583 --> 00:57:06,916
there are bridges and a tunnel.

1141
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:07,708
Remember?

1142
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:09,000
Of course.

1143
00:57:09,083 --> 00:57:10,541
What I did tell the
kid was that his only shot

1144
00:57:10,625 --> 00:57:11,958
at overtaking his
opponent would be

1145
00:57:12,041 --> 00:57:13,916
at the last point on the course.

1146
00:57:14,708 --> 00:57:16,541
I also told him that
no matter what he did

1147
00:57:16,625 --> 00:57:19,458
at that point in the race
he'd be trailing the other car.

1148
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:21,166
He didn't understand
it at the time,

1149
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:22,500
but he's a sharp kid,

1150
00:57:22,583 --> 00:57:25,000
so there's a chance
he's figured it out by now.

1151
00:57:25,083 --> 00:57:27,333
You gave him some advice
on how to pass, right?

1152
00:57:27,416 --> 00:57:29,375
Sort of, I guess.

1153
00:57:30,625 --> 00:57:34,000
If he understands everything
I was saying to him...

1154
00:57:35,041 --> 00:57:36,750
Then he's got about
a fifty-fifty shot

1155
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:38,833
of edging out the other
kid before the finish.

1156
00:57:38,916 --> 00:57:40,250
That's all?

1157
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:43,083
Your own son and you're
calling the odds at fifty-fifty?

1158
00:57:43,166 --> 00:57:44,875
That is low.

1159
00:57:45,291 --> 00:57:46,541
Maybe so...

1160
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:49,500
I at least wanted to
challenge the kid a little.

1161
00:57:55,416 --> 00:57:59,666
Bunta, this time you're going to
be the one on the losing end.

1162
00:58:12,916 --> 00:58:14,666
He's unbelievable in that car.

1163
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:16,750
It's even more
obvious from behind.

1164
00:58:16,833 --> 00:58:19,041
We're almost at the same
skill level on the straightaway,

1165
00:58:19,125 --> 00:58:22,541
but he's so much
faster in these corners.

1166
00:58:24,666 --> 00:58:26,541
I'm breaking
myself just to keep up.

1167
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:28,625
How can I blow
past him like this?

1168
00:58:28,708 --> 00:58:30,166
Forget it.
It's no use.

1169
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:32,500
I'm gonna lose
just like dad said.

1170
00:58:33,458 --> 00:58:34,875
Wait a minute.

1171
00:58:34,958 --> 00:58:37,458
What was it he was
trying to tell me again?

1172
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,250
Your best shot at passing is

1173
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:43,208
going to be on
the very last bridge.

1174
00:58:43,291 --> 00:58:45,041
That's when your opponent
will be ahead of you,

1175
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:46,541
so try and watch for it.

1176
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:48,833
But, you don't know
he's gonna be ahead.

1177
00:58:48,916 --> 00:58:51,250
You better believe I do.

1178
00:58:51,333 --> 00:58:53,166
Now this is important,
so listen up.

1179
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:55,208
I'll only say it once.

1180
00:58:56,708 --> 00:58:58,541
Dry leaves start
to accumulate on the

1181
00:58:58,625 --> 00:59:00,458
Iroha Slopes this
time of the year.

1182
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:03,166
Those dry leaves
might decide the winner.

1183
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:05,666
Once you poke your nose
in on the first bridge,

1184
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:08,333
there's just enough room for
two cars to enter the second,

1185
00:59:08,416 --> 00:59:10,958
but it'll be a pretty
tight squeeze.

1186
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:14,166
I know you have the technique
to stay right beside him.

1187
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:17,666
You'll be tangled up
entering that third bridge.

1188
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:21,000
Luck'll do the rest.

1189
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:23,416
Do your best, kid.

1190
00:59:30,458 --> 00:59:33,125
So dad knew that Kai was
gonna use the jump up here.

1191
00:59:33,208 --> 00:59:35,208
He knew how all
of this would go down.

1192
00:59:35,291 --> 00:59:38,166
But now I don't know
what move to make next.

1193
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:40,750
These dry leaves are stacking
up all over the place.

1194
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:42,958
What am I gonna do?

1195
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,333
One more left.

1196
00:59:47,416 --> 00:59:49,041
The last hairpin turn.

1197
00:59:49,125 --> 00:59:50,833
And even if he can get
out of his middle gear

1198
00:59:50,916 --> 00:59:52,916
fast enough off the
curve he still won't

1199
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,041
be able to catch up with me.

1200
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:02,333
I'm feeling good, Pop.

1201
01:00:02,416 --> 01:00:05,625
Everything is going
just as we planned.

1202
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,416
I can see
the edge of the

1203
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,750
asphalt through
the dried leaves.

1204
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:13,208
That's what he meant!

1205
01:00:13,291 --> 01:00:16,000
I got it!
I know what I have to do!

1206
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:19,791
Here it goes!

1207
01:00:19,875 --> 01:00:22,000
This is my
last chance!

1208
01:00:29,916 --> 01:00:31,958
How is he passing
me on the inside!

1209
01:00:32,041 --> 01:00:34,291
That isn't possible!

1210
01:00:37,666 --> 01:00:39,125
What just happened back there?

1211
01:00:39,208 --> 01:00:41,125
What the hell was that?!

1212
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:48,083
Here they come!

1213
01:00:48,166 --> 01:00:49,625
Who's leading?

1214
01:00:51,041 --> 01:00:52,666
Looks like they're
running side by side!

1215
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,041
Whoa!

1216
01:00:54,125 --> 01:00:55,125
If either of them moves
an inch, they'll both slam

1217
01:00:55,208 --> 01:00:57,791
into the concrete walls
on the bridge!

1218
01:01:40,875 --> 01:01:42,166
I lost.

1219
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:43,791
I can't believe a
local was beaten

1220
01:01:43,875 --> 01:01:46,083
because of falling leaves.

1221
01:01:46,625 --> 01:01:49,958
You're one hell of a
driver Takumi Fujiwara.

1222
01:01:50,041 --> 01:01:51,708
The Eight-Six pulled it off.

1223
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,666
Kai spun out right
before the finish line

1224
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:56,083
and didn't even cross it.

1225
01:01:56,166 --> 01:01:57,250
Too bad.

1226
01:01:57,333 --> 01:01:58,791
Good call.

1227
01:02:00,208 --> 01:02:01,625
It's time for us to clear out.

1228
01:02:01,708 --> 01:02:03,208
Don't you think?

1229
01:02:03,583 --> 01:02:05,000
You got it.

1230
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:09,666
Takumi Fujiwara's
gonna be big someday.

1231
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:13,333
So big there's no chance
he'll stay in the Gunma area.

1232
01:02:13,416 --> 01:02:17,083
I understand why Ryosuke
sees so much promise in him.

1233
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:22,166
In fact, one day, he's gonna
leave Ryosuke far behind him.

1234
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:24,000
Right on, we're gonna
hit the road too.

1235
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:24,875
Cool.

1236
01:02:24,958 --> 01:02:26,250
Hey, sounds like it's over guys.

1237
01:02:26,333 --> 01:02:27,791
The Eight-Six won it.

1238
01:02:28,416 --> 01:02:31,333
He did it!
My best friend is so cool!

1239
01:02:31,416 --> 01:02:33,208
I can't believe I got to
be here here when the

1240
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:35,625
new legend of
the Eight-Six began.

1241
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,125
I love that car.

1242
01:02:37,208 --> 01:02:38,708
It's awesome.

1243
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:40,958
You know you don't
really need to cry about this.

1244
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:42,875
I'm just so happy for him!

1245
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:44,666
I can't keep
from crying, either!

1246
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:48,250
He won, he won,
I can't believe he won!

1247
01:02:53,541 --> 01:02:56,416
Hey, thanks a lot for
dodging me at the end there.

1248
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,458
You could have
split my car in two.

1249
01:02:58,833 --> 01:02:59,958
And it's not even my car.

1250
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:01,916
It belongs to my dad.

1251
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,625
I wanted to return it to
him in good condition.

1252
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:05,875
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1253
01:03:05,958 --> 01:03:07,583
Same here.

1254
01:03:07,666 --> 01:03:09,083
I was driving around
the other day and I

1255
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:11,208
passed the Eight Six
over on Akina.

1256
01:03:11,291 --> 01:03:14,125
Guess it stuck in my head,
because ever since that time,

1257
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:17,291
I thought there was no way I
could ever best it in a race.

1258
01:03:17,375 --> 01:03:18,458
It didn't matter that I knew

1259
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:20,875
I wasn't racing
against your father.

1260
01:03:21,333 --> 01:03:22,541
That was one hell of a run.

1261
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:24,333
And now that I'm sitting
in the loser's corner,

1262
01:03:24,416 --> 01:03:27,125
hindsight being what it is, I
guess my premonition was right.

1263
01:03:27,208 --> 01:03:29,750
Maybe I couldn't beat you, but
it was a good experience for me.

1264
01:03:29,833 --> 01:03:31,583
It's a shock for me to
lose on my own turf,

1265
01:03:31,666 --> 01:03:33,166
but I'll prob'ly
think back on this as

1266
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:35,000
one of those life
changing moments.

1267
01:03:35,083 --> 01:03:37,375
You and your dad
are both pretty great.

1268
01:03:37,458 --> 01:03:39,333
We're doing this
again someday, you know.

1269
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:41,833
And I'll train every
day til then.

1270
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:43,208
See ya.

1271
01:04:05,416 --> 01:04:07,083
Geez, it's freezing
out here today!

1272
01:04:07,166 --> 01:04:08,958
Takumi, do you have a pocket
warmer I could borrow?

1273
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:10,500
Or maybe a torch?

1274
01:04:10,583 --> 01:04:11,250
Nope.

1275
01:04:11,333 --> 01:04:12,583
Sorry man, I don't.

1276
01:04:12,666 --> 01:04:15,250
I hate the cold weather.

1277
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:18,416
So.

1278
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:19,541
Hey.

1279
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:23,208
What do you plan on
doing after graduation?

1280
01:04:23,291 --> 01:04:24,916
Graduation huh...

1281
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,958
Right, dude.
After you graduate.

1282
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:28,750
You're going to
college, aren't you?

1283
01:04:28,833 --> 01:04:29,875
Nope.

1284
01:04:29,958 --> 01:04:32,041
Not even a vocational school?

1285
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:33,333
I don't know.

1286
01:04:33,416 --> 01:04:34,666
Well, if you haven't decided,

1287
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:36,250
why don't you apply
here as a full-timer?

1288
01:04:36,333 --> 01:04:38,458
Do you know how much fun the
two of us could have together?

1289
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:39,875
You're joking.

1290
01:04:40,791 --> 01:04:43,166
No. I'm asking for a full
time spot starting in April.

1291
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:44,708
It seems like the
next best step for me.

1292
01:04:44,791 --> 01:04:46,916
And I couldn't think
of anything else to do.

1293
01:04:47,291 --> 01:04:49,541
Dude, why don't you ask him too?

1294
01:04:50,666 --> 01:04:52,791
Man, this hesitation
thing you got going

1295
01:04:52,875 --> 01:04:55,541
on is a tremendous time waster.

1296
01:04:58,208 --> 01:05:00,250
See you guys tomorrow.

1297
01:05:10,208 --> 01:05:11,791
Your car's different isn't it?

1298
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:14,750
Your seat, the feeling
of the car when it drives.

1299
01:05:14,833 --> 01:05:17,875
I dunno, it just feels
different from before.

1300
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:20,916
So Takumi...

1301
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,458
Do you have any plans
for Christmas this year?

1302
01:05:23,541 --> 01:05:24,916
I don't know.

1303
01:05:25,541 --> 01:05:28,583
Well, does your family usually
have a party or a dinner?

1304
01:05:28,666 --> 01:05:30,041
We haven't done much
around my house

1305
01:05:30,125 --> 01:05:31,250
for Christmas since I was a kid.

1306
01:05:31,333 --> 01:05:33,166
To us it's just
like another day.

1307
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:36,250
Maybe since I don't have
a mom, we just let it go.

1308
01:05:37,416 --> 01:05:39,291
But anyway, enough about that.

1309
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:42,166
So what is you've been
wanting to talk to me about?

1310
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:43,625
I wanted you to know.

1311
01:05:43,708 --> 01:05:46,041
I broke up with the guy who
drives that Mercedes Benz.

1312
01:05:46,583 --> 01:05:48,791
Look, whoever you wanna date is
none of my business okay?

1313
01:05:48,875 --> 01:05:50,583
You are a terrible liar.

1314
01:05:50,666 --> 01:05:52,166
If you thought it was
none of your business,

1315
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:55,375
you woudn't keep ignoring me
every time you saw me.

1316
01:05:55,458 --> 01:05:57,458
Because you were already
involved, you ignore me.

1317
01:05:57,541 --> 01:05:59,083
Simple man math.

1318
01:05:59,583 --> 01:06:01,625
We went to the beach over
the summer and we kissed.

1319
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:03,125
You're mad 'cause you
think what I've done

1320
01:06:03,208 --> 01:06:04,708
since then was a betrayal.

1321
01:06:04,791 --> 01:06:06,833
Isn't that what
this is all about?

1322
01:06:08,666 --> 01:06:10,208
I'm sorry.

1323
01:06:22,208 --> 01:06:23,625
It's cold.

1324
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,625
Winter is coming.

1325
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:27,708
I can't tell how you
feel about all of this,

1326
01:06:27,791 --> 01:06:30,291
but I really want to be
your friend again, Takumi.

1327
01:06:30,375 --> 01:06:31,916
I can't do that.

1328
01:06:32,958 --> 01:06:36,583
I can't just change how I
feel about you that easily.

1329
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:42,625
You think I like this crap
any more than you do!

1330
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:46,500
The difference is
that I'm not giving up?!

1331
01:06:46,583 --> 01:06:49,250
I'll make sure
our friendship survives!

1332
01:06:58,041 --> 01:06:59,041
There's something
I've been wanting to

1333
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:01,291
ask you for a long time.

1334
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:05,625
You're a really
popular girl, right?

1335
01:07:05,708 --> 01:07:07,375
If you wanted to date
someone else, you wouldn't

1336
01:07:07,458 --> 01:07:09,250
have a hard time
finding somebody.

1337
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:11,166
It doesn't make a
whole lot of sense.

1338
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:13,666
So, why did you pick me?

1339
01:07:17,291 --> 01:07:18,083
Why you?

1340
01:07:18,166 --> 01:07:20,500
I don't have just one reason.

1341
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:26,958
It's because I love you okay!

1342
01:07:57,958 --> 01:08:00,041
Thank you for your business!

1343
01:08:01,541 --> 01:08:03,041
Yo, Iketani!

1344
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:04,208
Hey...

1345
01:08:04,291 --> 01:08:05,208
I heard the weather
guy saying it could

1346
01:08:05,291 --> 01:08:06,625
start dumping snow
on us anytime.

1347
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:09,083
Sure feels cold enough
for that kinda thing tonight.

1348
01:08:09,166 --> 01:08:10,250
Tell me, Itsuki...

1349
01:08:10,333 --> 01:08:12,208
Got any big plans
brewing for Christmas?

1350
01:08:12,291 --> 01:08:13,708
Me?
My plans?

1351
01:08:13,791 --> 01:08:16,125
You wanna take a guess?

1352
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:18,541
Party all night with a couple
of your closest friends.

1353
01:08:18,625 --> 01:08:20,208
Last Christmas of
your high school life.

1354
01:08:20,291 --> 01:08:21,291
Go out with a blast.

1355
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,458
No way man.

1356
01:08:22,541 --> 01:08:24,083
I'm gonna be working
here all night long.

1357
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:25,916
I gotta make enough
cash for some new tires.

1358
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,708
My Levin needs studless
ones put on before

1359
01:08:27,791 --> 01:08:31,000
winter sets in and starts
jacking with my suspension.

1360
01:08:31,583 --> 01:08:33,541
You sound just like me.

1361
01:08:34,083 --> 01:08:36,083
Is Takumi doing anything?

1362
01:08:36,875 --> 01:08:37,958
Takumi?

1363
01:08:38,041 --> 01:08:39,541
Not sure.

1364
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:42,041
He's been completely out of it.

1365
01:08:42,125 --> 01:08:43,125
Totally brain dead.

1366
01:08:43,208 --> 01:08:46,291
And today he's just been weird.

1367
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:01,083
Hey dad, I, uh...

1368
01:09:01,166 --> 01:09:02,583
...um...

1369
01:09:02,666 --> 01:09:03,458
Look.

1370
01:09:03,541 --> 01:09:05,666
I'll be graduating pretty soon.

1371
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
So I thought...

1372
01:09:07,083 --> 01:09:09,250
Do whatever you want.

1373
01:09:11,041 --> 01:09:13,250
You can take over the tofu shop.

1374
01:09:13,333 --> 01:09:14,750
Or not.
Whatever...

1375
01:09:14,833 --> 01:09:16,666
It's your call kid.

1376
01:09:34,291 --> 01:09:35,625
How is it that you
don't have anything

1377
01:09:35,708 --> 01:09:38,000
better to do on Christmas eve?

1378
01:09:38,083 --> 01:09:39,083
Loser!

1379
01:09:39,166 --> 01:09:41,083
Can't you find better
company to keep?

1380
01:09:41,166 --> 01:09:42,500
Don't say that!

1381
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:44,541
It doesn't matter where I go.

1382
01:09:44,625 --> 01:09:47,083
It's a tough world for Mr.
Lonely out there guys.

1383
01:09:47,166 --> 01:09:48,250
Oh, I know!

1384
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:49,416
Wherever you look there
are happy couples

1385
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,458
cavorting around hand in hand!

1386
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:54,250
Whaddya say we
all go out to eat huh?

1387
01:09:54,333 --> 01:09:55,250
Something nice?

1388
01:09:55,333 --> 01:09:56,791
Little fancy?

1389
01:09:56,875 --> 01:09:58,041
Yeah, I'm game.

1390
01:09:58,125 --> 01:09:59,833
Are you in, Itsuki?

1391
01:09:59,916 --> 01:10:01,375
You better believe
I'm going with you!

1392
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:02,750
I got nothing else to do!

1393
01:10:02,833 --> 01:10:03,958
Takumi?

1394
01:10:04,041 --> 01:10:05,958
Sounds fun but I
don't have any money, so...

1395
01:10:06,041 --> 01:10:07,166
...no.

1396
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:12,083
You can be so anti-social
sometimes, you know that?

1397
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:26,125
Tofu shop.

1398
01:10:26,208 --> 01:10:26,958
There it is!

1399
01:10:27,041 --> 01:10:28,166
Finally.

1400
01:10:32,416 --> 01:10:34,416
'Kay here goes.

1401
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:37,250
Sheesh, it's cold out here.

1402
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,416
It'll be snowing on
the mountain, soon.

1403
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:43,333
Hi, uh, I'm a friend of tofu's.

1404
01:10:43,416 --> 01:10:44,500
No, I'm sorry.

1405
01:10:44,583 --> 01:10:45,583
What I meant to say was that

1406
01:10:45,666 --> 01:10:47,250
I'm a friend of
Takumi's from school.

1407
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:48,208
Oh, okay.

1408
01:10:48,291 --> 01:10:49,541
Takumi's friend.

1409
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:52,333
Sorry, he hasn't come back
from his work runs yet.

1410
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:56,375
All right.
Well, thank you.

1411
01:10:56,458 --> 01:10:57,958
I, uh...

1412
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,125
Never mind.

1413
01:11:01,208 --> 01:11:02,375
It's nothing.

1414
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:04,916
I hope you have a Merry
Christmas, goodnight.

1415
01:11:13,541 --> 01:11:14,625
She...

1416
01:11:14,708 --> 01:11:17,458
...kind of looks like
a homeless person.

1417
01:11:19,125 --> 01:11:20,791
Hold on a second, sweetheart.

1418
01:11:20,875 --> 01:11:22,250
Your bag looks a little heavy.

1419
01:11:22,333 --> 01:11:24,958
If you're here to see my
son, he'll be back soon.

1420
01:11:25,041 --> 01:11:27,125
Why don't you come
inside and warm up?

1421
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:29,625
I can make you a cup of tea.

1422
01:11:29,708 --> 01:11:32,250
Okay!
If you don't mind!

1423
01:11:36,791 --> 01:11:37,958
Christmas...

1424
01:11:38,041 --> 01:11:40,416
It's always so boring.

1425
01:11:41,875 --> 01:11:44,416
I'd feed you, but we're
down to just tea.

1426
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,958
Oh.

1427
01:11:46,041 --> 01:11:48,166
That's what you were carrying
in that giant bag of yours.

1428
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:49,541
It's cute, don't you think?

1429
01:11:49,625 --> 01:11:52,500
It lights up like a real
tree and everything.

1430
01:11:53,083 --> 01:11:54,791
It's beautiful.

1431
01:11:56,541 --> 01:11:57,583
An Eight-Six?

1432
01:11:57,666 --> 01:11:59,000
A handmade Eight-Six.

1433
01:11:59,083 --> 01:12:00,541
I did it myself.

1434
01:12:00,625 --> 01:12:03,291
I know how much that
car means to Takumi.

1435
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,833
Speaking of the kid, he must be
out wandering the streets again.

1436
01:12:07,916 --> 01:12:10,958
What time did you say you
two were supposed to meet?

1437
01:12:11,041 --> 01:12:12,166
Well, uh...

1438
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:14,416
...we didn't set any
specific time, exactly.

1439
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:18,166
I just wanted to come by and
wish Takumi a Merry Christmas.

1440
01:12:20,833 --> 01:12:22,083
I'll take these two.

1441
01:12:22,166 --> 01:12:23,375
Sure.

1442
01:12:32,041 --> 01:12:33,666
I've been wondering something.

1443
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:36,708
You're that girl who kept
calling all summer, aren't you?

1444
01:12:36,791 --> 01:12:38,458
That was me.

1445
01:12:38,541 --> 01:12:40,750
But then you up and
stopped calling out of nowhere.

1446
01:12:40,833 --> 01:12:43,958
Guess I'm just curious as to
what happened with all of that?

1447
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:45,875
Something did happen,
but I didn't think

1448
01:12:45,958 --> 01:12:46,916
it was that big a deal,

1449
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,500
and now it's like
Takumi hates me.

1450
01:12:49,833 --> 01:12:51,000
I don't want to
graduate with things

1451
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:52,708
like this between us,
so I'm doing everything

1452
01:12:52,791 --> 01:12:54,125
I can to bring it back around.

1453
01:12:54,208 --> 01:12:55,666
But he still hasn't forgiven me,

1454
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:57,750
and I don't know
if he's going to.

1455
01:12:57,833 --> 01:13:00,166
I don't know what happened,
but that's his personality.

1456
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:01,958
He's never been very
good at deciding whether

1457
01:13:02,041 --> 01:13:04,375
he should forgive
someone or hold a grudge.

1458
01:13:04,458 --> 01:13:05,708
That's just him.

1459
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,458
But I don't think he hates you.

1460
01:13:07,541 --> 01:13:09,583
He may be a teenager,
but more often than not

1461
01:13:09,666 --> 01:13:11,958
he acts like he's
a stubborn old man.

1462
01:13:12,041 --> 01:13:14,000
Once he's made up
his mind about something,

1463
01:13:14,083 --> 01:13:16,625
the kid sticks to it,
no matter what.

1464
01:13:16,708 --> 01:13:18,125
And when things
don't work out the way

1465
01:13:18,208 --> 01:13:22,333
he wanted them to,
he can get a little obnoxious.

1466
01:13:22,416 --> 01:13:25,333
Prob'ly gets it
from his old man.

1467
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:37,833
I'm home.

1468
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,041
Who's here?

1469
01:13:46,833 --> 01:13:48,375
Merry Christmas, Takumi.

1470
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:49,500
What's going on here?

1471
01:13:49,583 --> 01:13:50,708
What's this?

1472
01:13:50,791 --> 01:13:52,375
Surprise.

1473
01:13:52,458 --> 01:13:55,041
Dad, what the hell do
you think you're doing?

1474
01:13:55,375 --> 01:13:58,375
Merry Christmas!

1475
01:13:58,916 --> 01:13:59,500
This...

1476
01:13:59,583 --> 01:14:01,333
...is awesome!!

1477
01:14:01,416 --> 01:14:03,583
What should I sing next, guys?

1478
01:14:03,666 --> 01:14:07,416
How can he be like that without
a single drink in his system?

1479
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:08,875
I'm lonely.

1480
01:14:08,958 --> 01:14:09,916
Yeah, and lame.

1481
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,375
Oh, Mako.

1482
01:14:11,458 --> 01:14:12,791
Come on!

1483
01:14:12,875 --> 01:14:16,708
Road racers like us don't
need chicks anyway, do we?

1484
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:21,083
Takumi, would you move the
tree off the table please?

1485
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:22,625
Yeah, I got it.

1486
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:24,833
I've loved Christmas
ever since I was a kid.

1487
01:14:24,916 --> 01:14:26,375
It's my favorite holiday.

1488
01:14:26,458 --> 01:14:28,208
So this year,
I wanted to make sure

1489
01:14:28,291 --> 01:14:30,083
I could celebrate it with you.

1490
01:14:31,041 --> 01:14:32,583
You said you hadn't
had a Christmas party

1491
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:35,750
before and I thought this
was the perfect opportunity.

1492
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:41,000
Well, don't just
sit there staring at it!

1493
01:14:41,083 --> 01:14:42,333
Let's eat this cake!

1494
01:14:42,416 --> 01:14:43,125
Great.

1495
01:14:43,208 --> 01:14:44,166
Yeah... sounds good to me.

1496
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,916
Go on!
Light the candles!

1497
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,166
Can I see your lighter, dad?

1498
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:49,000
Oh... yeah.

1499
01:14:51,875 --> 01:14:53,500
Here go the lights.

1500
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:56,166
All right.

1501
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,625
Wow... I guess he
already went to sleep.

1502
01:15:30,291 --> 01:15:31,541
Huh?

1503
01:15:33,875 --> 01:15:35,041
So...

1504
01:15:35,125 --> 01:15:36,833
What are you going
to do after you graduate?

1505
01:15:36,916 --> 01:15:38,458
I haven't decided yet.

1506
01:15:38,541 --> 01:15:40,083
How about you?

1507
01:15:40,583 --> 01:15:41,625
Not yet.

1508
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:43,000
I've been giving it
a lot of thought.

1509
01:15:43,083 --> 01:15:44,708
And I just don't
think I can stay here

1510
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:46,416
and keep working
at the burger place.

1511
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,333
I need to find
something permanent.

1512
01:15:48,416 --> 01:15:50,208
So I'm thinking
of going to school.

1513
01:15:50,291 --> 01:15:52,166
in Tokyo.

1514
01:16:01,333 --> 01:16:02,291
We'd all like to say...

1515
01:16:02,375 --> 01:16:03,583
Thank you!

1516
01:16:04,375 --> 01:16:06,375
And a very happy
new year to you, sir.

1517
01:16:06,458 --> 01:16:07,833
Happy new year to you, too.

1518
01:16:07,916 --> 01:16:09,291
Now, being the start
of the year there

1519
01:16:09,375 --> 01:16:10,541
could be a lot of new customers.

1520
01:16:10,625 --> 01:16:11,666
I want you guys doing your best.

1521
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:12,875
So get your hustle on today.

1522
01:16:12,958 --> 01:16:14,791
Well, you can count on me, boss!

1523
01:16:14,875 --> 01:16:15,666
Me!

1524
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:17,000
You're pretty keyed up, Itsuki.

1525
01:16:17,083 --> 01:16:18,375
That's right, I am!

1526
01:16:18,458 --> 01:16:19,916
I'll be starting
full time in April,

1527
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,500
and I wanna have a
good lead in to that.

1528
01:16:22,958 --> 01:16:24,833
Gotta clean up over there.

1529
01:16:25,291 --> 01:16:27,750
You mean in April I have to
start seeing him every day.

1530
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:29,458
I don't know if I should
be happy about that or

1531
01:16:29,541 --> 01:16:31,833
start crying my little eyes out.

1532
01:16:31,916 --> 01:16:33,541
Takumi, don't just
stand there like a statue,

1533
01:16:33,625 --> 01:16:34,708
get to cleaning those windows!

1534
01:16:34,791 --> 01:16:35,916
Find yourself something to do!

1535
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,958
You got time to lean
you got time to clean!

1536
01:16:38,041 --> 01:16:40,125
Impressive leadership.

1537
01:16:40,208 --> 01:16:42,750
Well, my work ethic
is different from Takumi's.

1538
01:16:42,833 --> 01:16:45,250
I actually have one.

1539
01:16:56,333 --> 01:16:57,291
Thanks for coming in.

1540
01:16:57,375 --> 01:16:59,125
Have a good one.

1541
01:16:59,208 --> 01:17:00,958
Natski, I'm really
impressed with how

1542
01:17:01,041 --> 01:17:03,125
hard you've been
working this new year.

1543
01:17:03,625 --> 01:17:04,791
Wasn't this supposed to be

1544
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:06,916
just a temporary job for you?

1545
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,333
Yes, at first...

1546
01:17:08,416 --> 01:17:10,375
But I'm happy to keep
working for now, if that's okay.

1547
01:17:10,458 --> 01:17:11,750
Of course it is.

1548
01:17:11,833 --> 01:17:13,958
Once I got the job,
I realized something.

1549
01:17:14,041 --> 01:17:15,708
It's harder than
I thought to earn decent

1550
01:17:15,791 --> 01:17:18,708
money at a job
you actually like doing.

1551
01:17:18,791 --> 01:17:20,708
Isn't that the truth.

1552
01:17:20,791 --> 01:17:22,083
Hello.

1553
01:17:22,166 --> 01:17:23,916
Hi, and welcome to Fast Burger.

1554
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,916
I'll be happy to take your
order when you're ready.

1555
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,958
Just let me know when
you've made up your mind.

1556
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:29,833
Whoa, hey...

1557
01:17:29,916 --> 01:17:30,708
Natsuki!

1558
01:17:30,791 --> 01:17:31,750
What's up?

1559
01:17:31,833 --> 01:17:33,666
Aw, don't do that.

1560
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:36,583
Don't act like
you forgot about me.

1561
01:17:36,916 --> 01:17:38,583
Miki, hi.

1562
01:17:40,833 --> 01:17:42,083
Tell you what...

1563
01:17:42,166 --> 01:17:43,625
...just set me up with a
cheeseburger and a shake.

1564
01:17:43,708 --> 01:17:44,791
Yeah, okay.

1565
01:17:44,875 --> 01:17:48,000
Gimme a cheeseburger
shake combo all day.

1566
01:17:49,375 --> 01:17:51,916
So what do you say you join
me for a little drive, baby.

1567
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,833
I'll just take you home.

1568
01:17:53,916 --> 01:17:54,833
Oh...
no thanks.

1569
01:17:54,916 --> 01:17:56,083
I'm fine.

1570
01:17:56,166 --> 01:17:56,958
Hold on...

1571
01:17:57,041 --> 01:17:59,291
You look like you're worried?

1572
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:00,458
I won't bite.

1573
01:18:00,541 --> 01:18:01,916
It's not like I'm
not a rabid dog, lady.

1574
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:02,958
Keep it down!

1575
01:18:03,041 --> 01:18:04,208
Fine...

1576
01:18:04,291 --> 01:18:06,708
My shift will be over
in another half an hour.

1577
01:18:10,541 --> 01:18:12,416
I thought I'd come
home for winter break.

1578
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,291
See what things had changed.

1579
01:18:14,375 --> 01:18:17,000
Never expected to
see you working though.

1580
01:18:17,083 --> 01:18:19,750
You sure have changed a lot
in a short time, you know that?

1581
01:18:19,833 --> 01:18:22,791
That's funny, cuz I sure
don't feel any different.

1582
01:18:22,875 --> 01:18:24,291
You've changed though.

1583
01:18:24,375 --> 01:18:25,375
Grown up.

1584
01:18:25,458 --> 01:18:26,375
More attractive.

1585
01:18:26,458 --> 01:18:28,166
More of a woman.

1586
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:30,333
Do you got a boyfriend
on your arm these days?

1587
01:18:30,416 --> 01:18:33,583
I don't see how my love
life is any of your business.

1588
01:18:33,666 --> 01:18:34,708
Which says to me that you're

1589
01:18:34,791 --> 01:18:36,625
currently a little
more than single.

1590
01:18:36,708 --> 01:18:38,666
I'll try not to feel too
broken up about how

1591
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:40,708
you pretended you
forgot about me earlier

1592
01:18:40,791 --> 01:18:42,458
and we can go
straight to having a whole lot

1593
01:18:42,541 --> 01:18:45,583
of fun together like we used
to back in the good old days.

1594
01:18:45,666 --> 01:18:46,333
This is fine.

1595
01:18:46,416 --> 01:18:47,500
Pull over.

1596
01:18:47,583 --> 01:18:48,583
What?

1597
01:18:48,666 --> 01:18:49,750
What are you pissed about?

1598
01:18:49,833 --> 01:18:51,208
I have no intention of going out

1599
01:18:51,291 --> 01:18:52,541
with you now or ever again,

1600
01:18:52,625 --> 01:18:54,666
so you should
just leave me alone.

1601
01:18:54,750 --> 01:18:56,541
I may not have a
boyfriend, but I do have

1602
01:18:56,625 --> 01:18:58,791
someone in my life
that I care for very much.

1603
01:18:58,875 --> 01:19:01,708
And he's more precious
to me than anyone.

1604
01:19:01,791 --> 01:19:03,416
So goodbye.

1605
01:19:12,208 --> 01:19:13,541
Miki, stop!

1606
01:19:13,625 --> 01:19:15,125
Hey, don't sweat it, baby.

1607
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:17,041
Just spend a few more minutes
with me and we can talk all you

1608
01:19:17,125 --> 01:19:20,291
want about this guy of yours
who's so freakin' precious!

1609
01:19:20,375 --> 01:19:21,416
This is scary.

1610
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,250
He's lost it.

1611
01:19:29,958 --> 01:19:30,875
We're out, you guys!

1612
01:19:30,958 --> 01:19:32,375
See you tomorrow.

1613
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:35,500
I haven't seen it snow
like this in a while.

1614
01:19:35,583 --> 01:19:37,333
It's really coming
down out here.

1615
01:19:37,416 --> 01:19:39,041
Takumi, wait up a sec!

1616
01:19:39,125 --> 01:19:40,125
You wanna hang out.

1617
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:40,958
Huh?

1618
01:19:41,041 --> 01:19:41,666
I dunno.

1619
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:43,083
I probably can but...

1620
01:19:43,166 --> 01:19:45,625
C'mon, you don't have anything
to do at home, do you?

1621
01:19:45,708 --> 01:19:46,916
No.

1622
01:19:50,625 --> 01:19:52,083
Where are you taking me?

1623
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:54,791
Someplace no one will bother us.

1624
01:19:54,875 --> 01:19:57,750
Somewhere that you
and me can be alone.

1625
01:19:57,833 --> 01:19:59,791
I mean, the night is young.

1626
01:19:59,875 --> 01:20:01,166
Takumi.

1627
01:20:02,916 --> 01:20:05,416
So then Iketani said to me...

1628
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,625
Hey, something wrong, Takumi?

1629
01:20:07,708 --> 01:20:09,458
On second thought
I'd better not go.

1630
01:20:09,541 --> 01:20:10,541
Why not?

1631
01:20:10,625 --> 01:20:11,791
You know,
I just don't feel like it.

1632
01:20:11,875 --> 01:20:13,500
Dad went to a
New Years party with some

1633
01:20:13,583 --> 01:20:14,833
of his old drinking buddies,

1634
01:20:14,916 --> 01:20:16,500
so I'm willing to bet
he'll get all liquored up

1635
01:20:16,583 --> 01:20:18,791
and need me to give
him a ride home later on.

1636
01:20:18,875 --> 01:20:21,000
Let him find someone else.

1637
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:22,291
See ya.

1638
01:20:23,583 --> 01:20:25,000
Huh...

1639
01:20:25,083 --> 01:20:27,375
Sounds like it's about time
to move out of dad's house.

1640
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,250
Sweetheart, you and I used to

1641
01:20:34,333 --> 01:20:35,791
have a hell of a
lot of fun together.

1642
01:20:35,875 --> 01:20:37,583
Don't you remember?

1643
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:39,708
You listened to what
I said, and did anything

1644
01:20:39,791 --> 01:20:41,750
and everything
I wanted you to do.

1645
01:20:41,833 --> 01:20:43,708
Let that cat outta the bag.

1646
01:20:43,791 --> 01:20:45,291
Whattaya say?

1647
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:46,208
No way.

1648
01:20:46,291 --> 01:20:47,750
Wanna tell me why not?

1649
01:20:47,833 --> 01:20:50,416
I'm not the same
person I used to be.

1650
01:20:56,583 --> 01:20:57,833
Don't give me that!

1651
01:20:57,916 --> 01:20:59,958
When did you get to
be such a boring old cow!

1652
01:21:00,041 --> 01:21:01,333
What happened to you!

1653
01:21:01,416 --> 01:21:02,833
I mean you used to be
the kind of girl who knew

1654
01:21:02,916 --> 01:21:05,625
how to show a guy a decent time!

1655
01:21:06,083 --> 01:21:07,333
Yeah?

1656
01:21:07,416 --> 01:21:09,416
Well, maybe I found out
what a guy should be like!

1657
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:10,541
Right.

1658
01:21:10,625 --> 01:21:12,750
Come on, quit acting
so naive, Natsuki.

1659
01:21:12,833 --> 01:21:14,041
Here.

1660
01:21:42,416 --> 01:21:44,083
Hey!
Get back in here!

1661
01:21:44,458 --> 01:21:45,833
Natsuki!

1662
01:21:45,916 --> 01:21:47,291
Wait!

1663
01:21:47,375 --> 01:21:49,208
Natsuki!!!

1664
01:21:52,041 --> 01:21:53,458
Takumi!
Pick up the phone!

1665
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:55,333
Hurry!

1666
01:21:58,375 --> 01:21:59,500
Fine.
Run...

1667
01:21:59,583 --> 01:22:01,875
It's not like you can escape.

1668
01:22:06,875 --> 01:22:08,791
Takumi answer the phone!
Please!

1669
01:22:08,875 --> 01:22:10,916
You have to pick up!

1670
01:22:14,541 --> 01:22:15,708
Yeah.
That you, Dad?

1671
01:22:15,791 --> 01:22:17,041
Takumi!
Help me!

1672
01:22:17,125 --> 01:22:18,958
Come to the lake!

1673
01:22:19,583 --> 01:22:20,416
Hello?

1674
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,083
Mogi?
Is that you?

1675
01:22:22,416 --> 01:22:23,083
Hello?

1676
01:22:23,166 --> 01:22:24,041
Are you in trouble?

1677
01:22:24,125 --> 01:22:25,416
What's going on?

1678
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:26,375
Hello?

1679
01:22:26,458 --> 01:22:28,125
Hello?

1680
01:22:28,208 --> 01:22:30,625
I've never heard
her that freaked out.

1681
01:22:30,708 --> 01:22:32,166
What lake?

1682
01:22:32,666 --> 01:22:34,291
At Akina!

1683
01:22:37,541 --> 01:22:39,458
You were yelling out Takumi
just now, weren't you?

1684
01:22:39,541 --> 01:22:41,875
The guy you were
talking about is Fujiwara?

1685
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:42,875
Is that it?

1686
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,875
You're in love with Takumi?

1687
01:22:45,833 --> 01:22:48,625
I can't believe you fell
for a little punk like him!

1688
01:22:48,708 --> 01:22:50,166
Dammit!

1689
01:22:51,208 --> 01:22:53,291
I dunno how you could do
this to me, Natsuki!

1690
01:22:53,375 --> 01:22:56,708
I can't believe you'd ditch
me for some friggin' loser jerk.

1691
01:22:57,458 --> 01:22:58,666
You're gonna stop talking like

1692
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:00,875
that and you're
gonna stop it now.

1693
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:02,250
For an underclassman,
you're about

1694
01:23:02,333 --> 01:23:04,541
as cocky as you
are stupid, Takumi.

1695
01:23:04,625 --> 01:23:07,291
Seniors don't take
that kind of crap!

1696
01:23:09,666 --> 01:23:11,791
I always hate remembering that.

1697
01:23:12,458 --> 01:23:14,375
You know...

1698
01:23:14,458 --> 01:23:17,083
He's gonna do the
same thing to you again.

1699
01:23:17,166 --> 01:23:18,625
You little...

1700
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:20,291
Ha!

1701
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:21,583
You shoulda used
that tiny brain of yours

1702
01:23:21,666 --> 01:23:23,250
before you called
your boyfriend.

1703
01:23:23,333 --> 01:23:24,458
Tell me something.

1704
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:27,375
How's he supposed to
get here, without a car?

1705
01:23:27,458 --> 01:23:29,250
Takumi is faster
than almost anyone

1706
01:23:29,333 --> 01:23:31,500
else around when
he drives on the mountain.

1707
01:23:31,583 --> 01:23:32,541
He what?

1708
01:23:32,625 --> 01:23:34,666
Wait...
He has a car!

1709
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:35,250
Get up!

1710
01:23:35,333 --> 01:23:36,250
Get off the ice!

1711
01:23:36,333 --> 01:23:37,458
Move it!

1712
01:23:38,833 --> 01:23:40,666
You're coming with
me whether you like it or not!

1713
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:43,166
Shut your stinking mouth
and get in the car!

1714
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:44,791
Do it!

1715
01:24:00,125 --> 01:24:01,458
Where are we going?

1716
01:24:01,541 --> 01:24:04,166
Farther down the mountain
where nobody'll bother us.

1717
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:05,958
Hold on to your
socks good lookin'.

1718
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:08,708
I'm not letting you go 'til
I've gotten everything I want.

1719
01:24:08,791 --> 01:24:11,083
And I mean
every tasty little lick.

1720
01:24:11,166 --> 01:24:12,500
He's out of his mind.

1721
01:24:12,583 --> 01:24:14,583
I don't know how to
get out of this.

1722
01:24:14,666 --> 01:24:16,541
Hurry, Takumi.

1723
01:24:40,833 --> 01:24:41,750
Takumi...

1724
01:24:41,833 --> 01:24:44,500
I hope you get here soon.

1725
01:25:32,083 --> 01:25:33,625
Please, Takumi, help!

1726
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:35,083
It couldn't be!

1727
01:25:35,166 --> 01:25:37,666
Nobody is that fast!

1728
01:25:50,083 --> 01:25:51,500
I almost can't believe it.

1729
01:25:51,583 --> 01:25:53,708
Takumi came all the way up
the mountain just to save me.

1730
01:25:53,791 --> 01:25:55,041
Yeah.

1731
01:25:55,125 --> 01:25:56,541
And he did it in a rolling
piece of white garbage

1732
01:25:56,625 --> 01:25:59,125
that's about a hundred
fifty years old!

1733
01:26:01,083 --> 01:26:04,000
Calm down, sweet cheeks,
that drift was nothing!

1734
01:26:04,083 --> 01:26:05,000
Natsuki...

1735
01:26:05,083 --> 01:26:06,291
I hate to break the news to you,

1736
01:26:06,375 --> 01:26:07,666
but it's impossible
to keep up with

1737
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:09,375
my car in a junker like that.

1738
01:26:09,458 --> 01:26:10,916
I don't care how
good your car is,

1739
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,333
if anyone's fast enough to
stop you it's Takumi.

1740
01:26:13,416 --> 01:26:14,583
What a bunch of crap.

1741
01:26:14,666 --> 01:26:16,125
It doesn't matter
if he's terrible

1742
01:26:16,208 --> 01:26:17,750
or the world's best driver.

1743
01:26:17,833 --> 01:26:19,833
My car's a Four wheel drive.

1744
01:26:19,916 --> 01:26:21,958
And if you knew anything
about cars, you'd know

1745
01:26:22,041 --> 01:26:23,666
the Four wheel
drive runs better on

1746
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:26,875
snow than any other
car on the road.

1747
01:26:45,791 --> 01:26:48,458
Snow is nothing to
a car like this.

1748
01:26:48,541 --> 01:26:50,041
I just make three
more curves and

1749
01:26:50,125 --> 01:26:51,666
that will be the
last I see of your

1750
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:54,375
Mr. Hero in my rearview mirror.

1751
01:26:57,083 --> 01:26:58,625
What the hell?

1752
01:26:59,791 --> 01:27:01,500
How did he do that?

1753
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:02,750
Dammit!

1754
01:27:07,375 --> 01:27:08,791
Impossible!

1755
01:27:08,875 --> 01:27:11,416
How could a relic like that
tailgate a Four Wheel Drive?

1756
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,375
It has nothing to do
with how old his car is.

1757
01:27:13,458 --> 01:27:15,166
You're just driving too slow.

1758
01:27:15,250 --> 01:27:16,708
You think 'cuz
your boyfriend's pulling

1759
01:27:16,791 --> 01:27:18,500
in behind me you can insult me?

1760
01:27:18,583 --> 01:27:21,125
Keep your eyes on the road,
you're gonna wreck!

1761
01:27:24,708 --> 01:27:27,291
I don't get it, he's on
me like a damn shadow!

1762
01:27:27,375 --> 01:27:29,541
See if you can follow this!

1763
01:27:29,625 --> 01:27:30,250
Crap!

1764
01:27:30,333 --> 01:27:32,291
That's not good!

1765
01:27:32,375 --> 01:27:34,375
No, it won't turn!

1766
01:27:40,208 --> 01:27:40,958
Don't hit me!
Don't hit me!

1767
01:27:41,041 --> 01:27:41,875
Don't hit me!

1768
01:27:41,958 --> 01:27:43,541
Don't hit me!
Don't hit me!

1769
01:27:50,583 --> 01:27:51,833
Takumi!

1770
01:27:52,208 --> 01:27:53,625
Natsuki.

1771
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,250
I'm so glad that
you came for me.

1772
01:27:56,333 --> 01:27:57,500
What's all this about?

1773
01:27:57,583 --> 01:27:59,208
I could barely understand
you on the phone,

1774
01:27:59,291 --> 01:28:01,458
so I just got here
as fast as I could.

1775
01:28:01,541 --> 01:28:02,916
Who's the guy in the car?

1776
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,541
Do you know him?

1777
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:07,541
I'll tell you once
we get out of here.

1778
01:28:07,625 --> 01:28:09,708
Can we please just go?

1779
01:28:14,291 --> 01:28:15,791
Are you mad at me?

1780
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:18,416
I'm sorry.

1781
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:21,500
None of this would have happened
if I hadn't been so stupid.

1782
01:28:21,583 --> 01:28:23,041
Don't worry about it.

1783
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:25,625
I'm so sorry.

1784
01:28:25,708 --> 01:28:27,000
I'll give you a ride back home.

1785
01:28:27,083 --> 01:28:29,833
This doesn't have to be
anything more than that.

1786
01:28:29,916 --> 01:28:31,708
I can't go back home.

1787
01:28:31,791 --> 01:28:33,083
At least not like this.

1788
01:28:33,166 --> 01:28:34,791
I...

1789
01:28:36,625 --> 01:28:37,833
I don't think I'll
ever have another

1790
01:28:37,916 --> 01:28:40,541
chance to say this
to you so please listen.

1791
01:28:40,625 --> 01:28:42,250
Will you do that?

1792
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:43,916
The man I was going out with,

1793
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,708
you know, the man with the Benz.

1794
01:28:45,791 --> 01:28:49,166
I don't know how to say it other
than just to come out with it.

1795
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:50,958
I was getting money from him.

1796
01:28:51,041 --> 01:28:53,041
I regret doing that
more than anything.

1797
01:28:53,125 --> 01:28:55,291
It makes me feel so bad inside.

1798
01:28:55,375 --> 01:28:56,791
Every time I took his money,

1799
01:28:56,875 --> 01:28:59,958
I felt a tiny piece
of me lift away.

1800
01:29:00,041 --> 01:29:02,333
Like the important
part of my soul

1801
01:29:02,416 --> 01:29:04,750
was flaking away into ashes.

1802
01:29:04,833 --> 01:29:06,750
The whole reason I took the
job at the burger place

1803
01:29:06,833 --> 01:29:10,583
was because I thought I could
get back some of what I lost.

1804
01:29:11,625 --> 01:29:13,166
And because I wanted to show you

1805
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:15,625
I was trying hard
to be different.

1806
01:29:16,083 --> 01:29:19,958
I wanted you to look at me and
see me for what I truly am.

1807
01:29:20,041 --> 01:29:22,333
Forget it...
Never mind.

1808
01:29:22,416 --> 01:29:25,000
You must think I'm so
silly for crying like this.

1809
01:29:25,083 --> 01:29:26,375
Well, I hate doing it.

1810
01:29:26,458 --> 01:29:29,250
I just wish I could
stop it already.

1811
01:29:29,666 --> 01:29:31,958
I'm terrible.

1812
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,375
When did I become
such a crybaby?

1813
01:29:35,458 --> 01:29:37,125
You'd think a girl
telling you these stories

1814
01:29:37,208 --> 01:29:39,000
would be a little tougher.

1815
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:41,000
I'm sorry.

1816
01:29:41,083 --> 01:29:43,250
I'm sorry Takumi.

1817
01:29:44,875 --> 01:29:46,416
It's my turn.

1818
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:48,916
I have something that
I want to say to you, too.

1819
01:29:49,666 --> 01:29:52,333
And this is how I really feel.

1820
01:29:53,541 --> 01:29:54,666
I...

1821
01:29:55,625 --> 01:29:58,458
I love you, Mogi.

1822
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:24,833
You wanna race me?

1823
01:30:24,916 --> 01:30:25,916
That's right.

1824
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,708
If you have the time.

1825
01:30:27,791 --> 01:30:29,250
I'm still waiting
on you to tell me

1826
01:30:29,333 --> 01:30:30,750
whether you're
joining my team or not.

1827
01:30:30,833 --> 01:30:32,333
Any word?

1828
01:30:32,416 --> 01:30:34,458
Well, that's something I want to
decide after my battle with you.

1829
01:30:34,541 --> 01:30:36,500
If that's okay.

1830
01:30:40,333 --> 01:30:41,625
That's cool.

1831
01:30:41,708 --> 01:30:43,458
And your conditions?

1832
01:30:44,166 --> 01:30:45,916
You go on ahead of
me and I'll follow you.

1833
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,666
The location of the battle
is gonna be at Akagi.

1834
01:30:50,416 --> 01:30:52,250
I mean, I don't I think
I can win or anything.

1835
01:30:52,333 --> 01:30:54,708
But the last time we
raced was at Mount Akina.

1836
01:30:54,791 --> 01:30:56,750
So I wanted to even
the playing field a little and

1837
01:30:56,833 --> 01:30:59,416
run the next one
on your home course.

1838
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:00,625
I feel like this
is what I have to

1839
01:31:00,708 --> 01:31:02,875
do to find my answer for you.

1840
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:04,541
Understood.

1841
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:07,125
I'll be eagerly looking
forward to next Saturday.

1842
01:31:10,625 --> 01:31:13,166
So you want me to
teach you about the location.

1843
01:31:13,250 --> 01:31:14,333
Right.

1844
01:31:14,416 --> 01:31:16,875
I'd appreciate any
advice you can give me.

1845
01:31:16,958 --> 01:31:18,000
I...

1846
01:31:18,083 --> 01:31:20,333
I really want
to win this battle.

1847
01:31:25,666 --> 01:31:26,791
Okay.

1848
01:31:26,875 --> 01:31:28,416
Who are you up against?

1849
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:29,958
The FC.

1850
01:31:30,041 --> 01:31:30,875
Or...

1851
01:31:30,958 --> 01:31:32,708
...me.

1852
01:31:33,541 --> 01:31:35,625
Yourself, huh?

1853
01:31:36,375 --> 01:31:39,416
Time for graduation, I guess.

1854
01:31:40,708 --> 01:31:42,625
Okay, let's do this!

1855
01:31:43,125 --> 01:31:44,291
Go!

1856
01:31:50,625 --> 01:31:52,083
Incredible start!

1857
01:31:52,166 --> 01:31:54,000
In the blink of an eye.

1858
01:31:55,541 --> 01:31:56,625
Right out of the gate!

1859
01:31:56,708 --> 01:31:57,916
It's a double drift!

1860
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,166
Don't see that every day.

1861
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:07,833
I can feel his
presence so strongly.

1862
01:32:07,916 --> 01:32:09,458
He must be
concentrating on driving

1863
01:32:09,541 --> 01:32:11,833
as fast as he possibly can.

1864
01:32:11,916 --> 01:32:14,333
Faster than he
ever has before, maybe.

1865
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:20,750
This is what I need to see.

1866
01:32:20,833 --> 01:32:22,833
Show me what you got.

1867
01:32:29,833 --> 01:32:30,833
He is awesome!

1868
01:32:30,916 --> 01:32:32,000
Look at 'em go!

1869
01:32:32,083 --> 01:32:33,708
This is great!

1870
01:32:37,166 --> 01:32:38,333
The FC is incredible,

1871
01:32:38,416 --> 01:32:39,875
but the Eight-Six
is something else!

1872
01:32:39,958 --> 01:32:41,375
He puts so much into his
driving,

1873
01:32:41,458 --> 01:32:42,833
it's like you can see his aura.

1874
01:32:42,916 --> 01:32:43,708
Whoa.

1875
01:32:43,791 --> 01:32:46,041
Takeshi, don't stand so close.

1876
01:32:46,583 --> 01:32:47,916
I mean, if somebody
didn't know any

1877
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,958
better they might actually
think that we're friends.

1878
01:32:50,041 --> 01:32:51,083
So back off.

1879
01:32:51,166 --> 01:32:52,583
You got it.

1880
01:32:57,625 --> 01:32:59,708
So what do you think,
how's this gonna turn out?

1881
01:32:59,791 --> 01:33:01,375
I dunno, but I can
promise you one thing,

1882
01:33:01,458 --> 01:33:03,875
Ryosuke will not
lose on his home turf.

1883
01:33:03,958 --> 01:33:06,125
You can't make those
kinds of guarantees.

1884
01:33:06,208 --> 01:33:08,166
You guys are totally
missing the point.

1885
01:33:08,916 --> 01:33:11,833
This race was never about
crowning a winner or loser.

1886
01:33:11,916 --> 01:33:14,208
As long as those two
drive at their full potential,

1887
01:33:14,291 --> 01:33:15,666
it'll be fine.

1888
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:18,416
I'm kinda jealous.

1889
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:22,041
I wish I took driving half as
seriously as these guys do.

1890
01:33:25,166 --> 01:33:25,916
Wow.

1891
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,916
He's better than I thought.

1892
01:33:29,333 --> 01:33:31,375
His skill level has
improved drastically

1893
01:33:31,458 --> 01:33:33,625
since the battle on Akina.

1894
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:52,291
This is all so strange to me.

1895
01:33:52,375 --> 01:33:54,083
I've felt for a while now
that my technique

1896
01:33:54,166 --> 01:33:55,750
was as refined as
I could get it.

1897
01:33:55,833 --> 01:33:57,625
I thought it was complete.

1898
01:33:57,708 --> 01:34:00,625
But as I race with him,
I'm discovering something new.

1899
01:34:00,708 --> 01:34:03,125
I've never had so
much fun in a battle.

1900
01:34:03,208 --> 01:34:05,000
Every worry I have is gone.

1901
01:34:05,083 --> 01:34:06,666
All I have to do is follow him.

1902
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:08,500
And drive.

1903
01:34:43,041 --> 01:34:44,458
Takumi!

1904
01:34:47,958 --> 01:34:49,375
So we graduated.

1905
01:34:49,458 --> 01:34:51,375
How does it feel?

1906
01:34:51,458 --> 01:34:52,750
Okay.

1907
01:34:53,125 --> 01:34:56,000
I think I'm seeing a few
of my friends later on.

1908
01:34:56,083 --> 01:34:59,083
But I'm probably just gonna
show my face and leave.

1909
01:35:02,958 --> 01:35:04,166
Natsuki!

1910
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:05,666
Come on, let's go!

1911
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:06,375
One sec!

1912
01:35:06,458 --> 01:35:07,916
I'll be right there!

1913
01:35:09,041 --> 01:35:10,666
Bye.

1914
01:35:11,166 --> 01:35:12,750
Hey, there you are, Takumi!

1915
01:35:12,833 --> 01:35:14,500
I've been looking for you.

1916
01:35:14,583 --> 01:35:16,041
Graduations always
make me depressed.

1917
01:35:16,125 --> 01:35:18,416
I don't even know why!

1918
01:35:19,125 --> 01:35:20,125
What's the deal?

1919
01:35:20,208 --> 01:35:21,375
Got any after
graduation plans or you

1920
01:35:21,458 --> 01:35:22,625
wanna come over to my place?

1921
01:35:22,708 --> 01:35:25,000
We could get some sushi
and chill or something.

1922
01:35:25,416 --> 01:35:28,291
Well, I'm kinda...

1923
01:35:29,125 --> 01:35:32,333
You're gonna go see Natsuki
all by yourself aren't you?

1924
01:35:32,416 --> 01:35:33,333
Maybe, I...

1925
01:35:33,416 --> 01:35:34,333
No, it's cool, man!

1926
01:35:34,416 --> 01:35:35,541
Do that!

1927
01:35:35,625 --> 01:35:38,333
After all I'm nothing
but a lonely driver!

1928
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:41,041
I'm gonna go talk
with Iketani at the station!

1929
01:35:41,125 --> 01:35:42,750
He'll make me
feel better about this!

1930
01:35:42,833 --> 01:35:45,583
He always does!

1931
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:56,500
The lake is beautiful.

1932
01:35:56,583 --> 01:35:58,833
All of the ice
has finally melted.

1933
01:35:58,916 --> 01:36:00,708
And it keeps getting warmer.

1934
01:36:00,791 --> 01:36:01,791
Every day.

1935
01:36:01,875 --> 01:36:03,625
A little bit warmer.

1936
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:20,083
So, uh.

1937
01:36:20,166 --> 01:36:21,875
I heard somewhere
you were able to

1938
01:36:21,958 --> 01:36:24,541
get hired on at a
local delivery service.

1939
01:36:25,083 --> 01:36:25,708
Yeah.

1940
01:36:25,791 --> 01:36:26,708
You know me.

1941
01:36:26,791 --> 01:36:27,916
I couldn't imagine
doing anything

1942
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,916
in my life without a car.

1943
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:30,791
I...

1944
01:36:30,875 --> 01:36:32,916
I don't want to be without you.

1945
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,125
I knew it would
happen like this

1946
01:36:35,208 --> 01:36:37,250
but I don't have to like it.

1947
01:36:38,458 --> 01:36:42,541
Have you ever even considered
going back to Tokyo with me?

1948
01:36:42,625 --> 01:36:43,875
Well?

1949
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:48,750
I think I'll stay here.

1950
01:36:48,833 --> 01:36:51,833
There's something that's been
on my mind since last year.

1951
01:36:54,416 --> 01:36:57,250
I've been thinking
about my dream in life.

1952
01:36:57,333 --> 01:36:59,083
All winter long,
it was on my mind.

1953
01:36:59,166 --> 01:37:00,750
It's all I thought about.

1954
01:37:00,833 --> 01:37:03,041
I finally figured it out.

1955
01:37:03,125 --> 01:37:05,041
What I want to do is drive.

1956
01:37:05,125 --> 01:37:08,583
I wanna to drive faster than the
next guy, faster than anyone.

1957
01:37:08,666 --> 01:37:12,166
I've decided I want to
be a professional driver.

1958
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:15,208
It's because of that,
I have to stay here.

1959
01:37:15,291 --> 01:37:16,708
Because of that?

1960
01:37:16,791 --> 01:37:18,875
I want to find a new team
around here and join up.

1961
01:37:18,958 --> 01:37:20,375
That way I can learn
some new styles,

1962
01:37:20,458 --> 01:37:22,708
techniques,
whatever they're teaching.

1963
01:37:22,791 --> 01:37:23,791
It's just that.

1964
01:37:23,875 --> 01:37:26,125
what I really want to
be is the best.

1965
01:37:26,541 --> 01:37:27,708
To be the top driver.

1966
01:37:27,791 --> 01:37:29,875
The one that nobody can defeat.

1967
01:37:30,916 --> 01:37:34,916
And you will,
but I'll miss you so much.

1968
01:37:37,916 --> 01:37:39,666
It's overwhelming.

1969
01:37:40,125 --> 01:37:43,791
I may be lonely, but I'll
be able to get through it.

1970
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,708
If it hadn't been for you,

1971
01:37:47,791 --> 01:37:49,666
my entire high school
existence would have

1972
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:52,958
been nothing but a
catalogue of bad memories.

1973
01:37:54,791 --> 01:37:56,833
But because of you,
because you were

1974
01:37:56,916 --> 01:38:01,416
always there for me, there were
a lot of good memories, too.

1975
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:03,375
I just have to accept
the fact that I'm not

1976
01:38:03,458 --> 01:38:06,541
enough for you
anymore, if I ever was.

1977
01:38:06,625 --> 01:38:08,000
Which is okay.

1978
01:38:08,083 --> 01:38:09,958
Because I get the memories.

1979
01:38:10,041 --> 01:38:13,000
And those I can carry
with me the rest of my life.

1980
01:38:13,083 --> 01:38:15,750
You make them so precious to me.

1981
01:38:15,833 --> 01:38:17,916
So be true to yourself, Takumi.

1982
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,833
And make all of
your dreams come true.

1983
01:38:20,916 --> 01:38:22,291
Takumi!

1984
01:38:26,458 --> 01:38:27,875
Takumi, I'm going to try hard to

1985
01:38:27,958 --> 01:38:30,500
be the person you
showed me I can be.

1986
01:38:30,583 --> 01:38:33,916
And I'm never going to give up.

1987
