1
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,569
Here you go, ten days off.

2
00:02:10,803 --> 00:02:13,061
All officially approved Taeko.

3
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,084
All that time off and your only going to the countryside?

4
00:02:16,157 --> 00:02:16,717
Yes.

5
00:02:16,872 --> 00:02:18,626
Break up with your boyfriend or something?

6
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:22,337
I just love the countryside.

7
00:02:22,478 --> 00:02:23,322
Bye!

8
00:02:23,337 --> 00:02:23,962
See ya!

9
00:02:24,232 --> 00:02:25,415
Let's go to your place!

10
00:02:25,714 --> 00:02:26,808
No way!

11
00:02:26,843 --> 00:02:28,188
Why not you jerk!

12
00:02:28,204 --> 00:02:29,164
Because!

13
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:29,604
Come on.

14
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:31,960
Hi Aiko, heard you got a bad report.

15
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:34,366
Uh-huh, but I don't mind.

16
00:02:34,443 --> 00:02:35,229
How come?

17
00:02:35,348 --> 00:02:38,358
As soon as we get home, we're going
to my grandma's in the countryside.

18
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:40,899
So it'll be ages before I get yelled at.

19
00:02:40,987 --> 00:02:42,100
Your lucky!

20
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:44,165
Your going to the country side too?

21
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:47,100
Yup, Nagano. How about you Taeko?

22
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,231
I don't know.

23
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,724
Guess where I'm going.

24
00:02:49,726 --> 00:02:51,173
My dad bought a summer house.

25
00:02:51,198 --> 00:02:53,122
Wow! Amazing!

26
00:02:54,514 --> 00:02:57,912
Taeko, such a bad grade in math again?

27
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,358
But science improved, did you notice?

28
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,147
Hey mom, where are we going this summer?

29
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,248
Nowhere.

30
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:08,170
But I want you to take me somewhere.

31
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,813
I can take you to a movie.

32
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:12,959
The Grateful Crane is playing, isn't it?

33
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:15,293
No, that's not what I mean.

34
00:03:15,456 --> 00:03:16,928
Take me to the country side.

35
00:03:16,944 --> 00:03:17,944
Country side?

36
00:03:18,005 --> 00:03:19,888
Yes, maybe grandma's village.

37
00:03:19,904 --> 00:03:21,280
Grandma lives here with us.

38
00:03:21,362 --> 00:03:23,108
Well then, what about grandpa's?

39
00:03:23,124 --> 00:03:24,311
He died remember?

40
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,263
We don't have any relatives in the country,

41
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:29,069
please don't ask me for things you know we don't have.

42
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:33,621
Both my parents were born and razed in Tokyo.

43
00:03:33,845 --> 00:03:38,459
Unlike my friends, we didn't have any home
village we could easily visit out in the countryside.

44
00:03:38,972 --> 00:03:40,475
And even if we did...

45
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:45,795
Going away now would be imposable,
everywhere would be all full up.

46
00:03:46,047 --> 00:03:47,491
I wanna go!

47
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:49,975
There is the "Onoya"?

48
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:52,154
We used to go there all the time.

49
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,997
I'm sure they'd find a room for us.

50
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:54,645
Don't you think...

51
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,449
Sounds great!

52
00:03:55,465 --> 00:03:56,184
Lets go!

53
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,567
Yeah mom, that a great idea and Taeko's never been there.

54
00:03:59,814 --> 00:04:01,098
Huh, that's right.

55
00:04:01,114 --> 00:04:03,332
Hey, is it in the mountains... the sea?

56
00:04:04,152 --> 00:04:04,934
In Atami.

57
00:04:06,902 --> 00:04:07,806
Atami?

58
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:10,468
Its fab and you get to take the bullet train.

59
00:04:10,845 --> 00:04:13,082
That's right, you'll love the bullet train.

60
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:17,555
Atami...

61
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:18,857
It's a lots of fun.

62
00:04:18,942 --> 00:04:20,755
There's all kinds of hot springs.

63
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:23,903
Oh, but you know, the biggest one is the Roman Bath.

64
00:04:24,036 --> 00:04:24,786
She's right,

65
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,925
and there's a whole lot of little ones as well.

66
00:04:27,176 --> 00:04:29,708
There's a mermaid bath and one called the Swan.

67
00:04:29,724 --> 00:04:31,661
Oh! That ones my favorite.

68
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,091
A mermaid?

69
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,302
Oh yeah. You might even see a real mermaid.

70
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:38,410
And you just love hot springs.

71
00:04:38,435 --> 00:04:39,591
With mermaids.

72
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:42,903
Well, your father has to work
so why don't the four of you go?

73
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:43,724
Huh?!

74
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:45,536
Uh.

75
00:04:45,613 --> 00:04:46,221
Oh.

76
00:04:47,825 --> 00:04:49,458
The four of us?

77
00:04:49,474 --> 00:04:50,520
Oh great.

78
00:04:57,772 --> 00:05:01,173
Your here every day Taeko, that's pretty impressive.

79
00:05:01,682 --> 00:05:03,688
All my friends have gone to the country.

80
00:05:06,437 --> 00:05:08,676
So ah, aren't you going anywhere?

81
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:11,102
Yup', Atami.

82
00:05:11,884 --> 00:05:14,859
Atami? What are you going to do in Atami?

83
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,587
Take hot springs baths.

84
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:18,931
Oh.

85
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:22,126
That's really good timing.

86
00:05:22,295 --> 00:05:25,889
Me and my family go away next week and
there won't be anyone here for a while.

87
00:05:26,428 --> 00:05:27,850
Have a great time in Atami.

88
00:05:27,878 --> 00:05:28,634
OK.

89
00:05:28,752 --> 00:05:29,834
See you later then.

90
00:05:32,662 --> 00:05:34,100
Okajima Residence. Hello.

91
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,358
Hey Nanako, it's Taeko how are you.

92
00:05:37,928 --> 00:05:40,475
I'm heading up to the farm
today to see your husband's family.

93
00:05:40,563 --> 00:05:41,714
Need me to bring anything?

94
00:05:42,186 --> 00:05:43,905
Nothing in particular.

95
00:05:44,114 --> 00:05:46,834
Oh wait, maybe you could buy some cookies for Naoko.

96
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,120
And tell her there from Morockometo and me.

97
00:05:49,412 --> 00:05:50,451
I'll pay you back.

98
00:05:50,453 --> 00:05:52,491
No problem. Don't worry about it.

99
00:05:52,788 --> 00:05:53,874
So, how's mom?

100
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,530
She's out today.

101
00:05:56,068 --> 00:05:57,240
But she's mad at you.

102
00:05:57,484 --> 00:05:59,248
You wouldn't even meet that guy.

103
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,530
It was a sure thing and all agreed.
She's said 27 and to old to be picky.

104
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:06,321
Oh, that's all mom ever thinks about.

105
00:06:06,461 --> 00:06:09,105
True, but you could think about it a little bit more.

106
00:06:09,225 --> 00:06:10,465
You're not so young anymore.

107
00:06:10,527 --> 00:06:12,002
Oh, thanks a lot.

108
00:06:12,018 --> 00:06:12,910
Tae, your not old.

109
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,985
But what's wrong with settling down
instead of doing all these wacky things.

110
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,637
Did you really take a vacation
to work in the fields last year?

111
00:06:20,653 --> 00:06:24,458
Yup', harvesting rice. This year, I'm picking safflowers.

112
00:06:24,654 --> 00:06:25,575
Safflowers?

113
00:06:25,591 --> 00:06:29,606
Yes! Cause-a' you, I gots' me a fine farm family now.

114
00:06:30,194 --> 00:06:32,362
And they've adopted me as one of there own.

115
00:06:32,378 --> 00:06:33,520
Aw, give me a break.

116
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:35,411
Sho' nuff.

117
00:06:36,248 --> 00:06:37,744
You don't get that much vacation.

118
00:06:37,876 --> 00:06:43,856
Don't stay in that drafty old house. Why not treat
yourself to a fancy hotel somewhere and relax, unwind

119
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:46,666
you might even meet someone special up there.

120
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:51,059
You can forget about that. And I
don't believe in mermaids anymore either.

121
00:06:51,247 --> 00:06:52,168
"Mermaids"?

122
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,973
Oh yeah, right the bath in Atami.

123
00:06:55,974 --> 00:06:57,650
Are you still dwelling on that?

124
00:06:58,066 --> 00:07:00,398
Taeko, you still hang on to things don't you.

125
00:07:12,739 --> 00:07:15,739
My sisters, of didn't want to go anyplace like Atami.

126
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,044
So, of course they didn't.

127
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:21,243
Uh, grandma?

128
00:07:21,277 --> 00:07:22,649
Mm.. Mmm.

129
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:24,362
Come on.

130
00:07:25,173 --> 00:07:27,429
Can we go to a bath now?

131
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:29,437
We just got back from one.

132
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:31,900
But that was only a little one.

133
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,867
I was board out of my mind.

134
00:07:33,883 --> 00:07:35,195
So, I tried them all.

135
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:37,992
The Grimm Brothers Bath.

136
00:07:39,174 --> 00:07:41,296
The Mermaid, The Lemon.

137
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:43,101
The Purple Pansy Bath, and..

138
00:07:43,406 --> 00:07:46,078
When I got to the Roman Bath my head was spinning.

139
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,268
It's huge!

140
00:07:53,872 --> 00:07:55,557
It's amazing...

141
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:08,975
I staggered, I swooned, I almost drowned.

142
00:08:09,714 --> 00:08:12,545
The overnight trip I begged for was over.

143
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:17,188
And awaiting me back home was
a long boring summer vacation.

144
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:32,066
The other day, my sisters and I were reminiscing.

145
00:08:33,008 --> 00:08:35,816
I found myself finally telling them about it.

146
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:40,628
We couldn't stop laughing as
the memories came flooding back.

147
00:08:45,847 --> 00:08:46,472
Cool.

148
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:48,823
You ever tried one?

149
00:08:48,868 --> 00:08:49,894
Only from a tin.

150
00:08:51,277 --> 00:08:52,839
I'm the one who asked for it.

151
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:53,956
Yeah, we know.

152
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,042
Dad, where'd you buy it?

153
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,128
The Sembikiya in Ginza.

154
00:08:58,301 --> 00:08:59,964
It must have cost the earth.

155
00:09:01,212 --> 00:09:02,706
So, how do you eat it?

156
00:09:03,027 --> 00:09:04,269
Slice it into rings.

157
00:09:04,302 --> 00:09:05,386
Slice it how?

158
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,378
Mm..

159
00:09:08,044 --> 00:09:08,769
I don't know.

160
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:13,222
Did you ask at the store how we should serve it?

161
00:09:13,365 --> 00:09:13,878
Umm.

162
00:09:18,364 --> 00:09:20,441
Let's save it and have it Sunday.

163
00:09:20,835 --> 00:09:23,224
Huh? Why not now?!

164
00:09:23,517 --> 00:09:26,002
I think we should wait until we know how to serve it.

165
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:29,916
I'll have a banana.

166
00:09:29,995 --> 00:09:30,970
Banana anyone?

167
00:09:30,972 --> 00:09:31,901
I want one.

168
00:09:35,854 --> 00:09:39,855
They certainly do have some strange
looking fruit in those hot countries.

169
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:43,738
I'm home!

170
00:09:44,612 --> 00:09:46,979
I found out how to cut up the pineapple!

171
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:48,355
Really?

172
00:09:54,854 --> 00:09:56,222
Watch your fingers Nanako.

173
00:09:56,238 --> 00:09:58,339
Wouldn't a carving knife work better?

174
00:10:10,325 --> 00:10:13,570
Wow! It smells so good.

175
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:15,773
Pineapple.

176
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,323
I can't wait.

177
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,721
Whad'ya know?

178
00:10:30,158 --> 00:10:31,705
Yaeko, get plates.

179
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:33,754
Huh? Oh yeah, plates!

180
00:10:35,518 --> 00:10:36,580
We give thanks.

181
00:10:36,596 --> 00:10:38,062
We give thanks.

182
00:10:58,594 --> 00:10:59,760
It's hard.

183
00:11:04,908 --> 00:11:06,393
It's nothing to rave about.

184
00:11:06,747 --> 00:11:08,284
It's not very sweet is it?

185
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,674
It doesn't taste anything like what you can get in a can.

186
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,143
Live as long as I have and you see everything.

187
00:11:19,426 --> 00:11:20,706
You can have mine Taeko.

188
00:11:20,924 --> 00:11:21,815
And mine too.

189
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:52,969
It's good...

190
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,312
Taeko, you don't have to eat all of it.

191
00:12:01,508 --> 00:12:02,461
You'll get sick.

192
00:12:11,882 --> 00:12:13,301
Oh well..

193
00:12:13,594 --> 00:12:15,074
That was a letdown.

194
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:20,121
Bananas taste a lot better, don't they?

195
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:21,348
You can say that again.

196
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,402
I guess bananas are still the king of fruit.

197
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:26,254
Time for a banana then.

198
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:54,236
The king of fruits.

199
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:56,791
The king of fruits..

200
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,424
Was the banana.

201
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,041
The year I fainted at the baths
and had my first pineapple...

202
00:13:07,337 --> 00:13:09,478
Was the year the Beatles came to Japan,

203
00:13:09,552 --> 00:13:11,830
starting the groups sounds craze.

204
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:15,181
Everyone wanted to play the electric guitar.

205
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,142
My sister Nanako, was a freshman in art school,

206
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:24,541
and always up on the latest trends.

207
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:29,041
Yum, Michelle right.. The Beatles' have such great lyrics.

208
00:13:29,065 --> 00:13:31,416
She was one of the first to wear a mini-skirt

209
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,299
and like everyone else,

210
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:37,463
soon figured out there was a right
way to avoid the wrong kind of stares.

211
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,392
My other sister, Yaeko, was in
her second year of high school.

212
00:13:41,702 --> 00:13:42,931
"Super brainy."

213
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:47,329
Still, I knew she was crazy.
About some Takarazuka actress.

214
00:13:47,345 --> 00:13:48,775
...you need to knock before coming in!

215
00:13:52,994 --> 00:13:55,010
When my sisters recall the good old days,

216
00:13:55,026 --> 00:13:57,658
it's mainly about fashions or pop stars.

217
00:13:57,984 --> 00:14:01,517
For them, 1966 was the high point of their youth.

218
00:14:02,236 --> 00:14:04,400
But for me, it was just for the grade.

219
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:07,361
Bands like the Tigers and Julie

220
00:14:07,588 --> 00:14:09,260
wouldn't appear until years later.

221
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:12,314
So, for me their discoveries of 1966

222
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:15,502
were mainly going to school and coming home and...

223
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:19,330
And then "my" essay was put up on the wall by my teacher.

224
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,564
Oh, that's wonderful.

225
00:14:22,158 --> 00:14:23,949
And then you know what he said mom?

226
00:14:23,965 --> 00:14:26,443
A book report this good should be read in the book club.

227
00:14:26,775 --> 00:14:28,916
Isn't that absolutely incredible?

228
00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:30,845
Well, isn't it?

229
00:14:31,255 --> 00:14:32,875
You didn't eat all your lunch again.

230
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:33,314
Huh?

231
00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:35,478
Why do you hide the pickles in your bread?

232
00:14:35,903 --> 00:14:38,049
'Cause I really hate pickles.

233
00:14:38,261 --> 00:14:41,892
Now I've got to throw all of this away. What a waste.

234
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,051
Your such a picky eater!

235
00:14:44,894 --> 00:14:47,094
I think it would be a whole lot better

236
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,688
if you were a girl who ate what she is given

237
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,231
instead of a girl whose essays are just
a little bit better than everyone else's.

238
00:15:08,326 --> 00:15:10,912
How do you drink that, its awful.

239
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,954
I don't think the milks too bad,

240
00:15:14,138 --> 00:15:16,053
it's the radish and onions I hate.

241
00:15:16,591 --> 00:15:18,351
Me, I'm sticking to carrots.

242
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:20,256
So, I'm going to have to drink the milk.

243
00:15:20,948 --> 00:15:23,722
It's stupid that we can only leave one thing on our plate?

244
00:15:23,738 --> 00:15:25,131
Who made this rule anyway?

245
00:15:25,744 --> 00:15:26,592
I'll drink it.

246
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:28,151
Huh? You will!

247
00:15:28,343 --> 00:15:31,342
Next time you eat my radish and onions, OK?

248
00:15:32,023 --> 00:15:33,198
Um-hum, um-hum, um-hum.

249
00:15:39,944 --> 00:15:40,647
Thank you!

250
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:44,481
Hey, don't...?

251
00:15:44,506 --> 00:15:46,155
We can leave one thing remember!

252
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,444
That second bowls' a killer.

253
00:15:58,103 --> 00:16:00,538
Some people keep running in the hall,

254
00:16:00,754 --> 00:16:03,724
and there are some people I won't name who don't stop

255
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:06,092
even when the hall monitor told them to.

256
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:09,255
Nobody's gonna turn around and then walk back.

257
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:11,795
You shouldn't really be running in the first place.

258
00:16:11,811 --> 00:16:13,037
Just don't do it.

259
00:16:13,053 --> 00:16:14,905
They're right. You could knock somebody over.

260
00:16:15,034 --> 00:16:19,252
Oh yeah, on the other hand if they ran
into you they'd just bounce right off.

261
00:16:19,268 --> 00:16:19,888
Stop!

262
00:16:19,903 --> 00:16:20,608
Boing.

263
00:16:22,517 --> 00:16:24,998
I don't know why everyone can't just walk in the halls.

264
00:16:25,014 --> 00:16:26,178
You know he's right.

265
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:26,897
Please!

266
00:16:26,976 --> 00:16:28,100
Please everybody.

267
00:16:28,115 --> 00:16:29,078
What's the big deal.

268
00:16:30,386 --> 00:16:32,866
If you have something to say, please, raise your hand.

269
00:16:33,175 --> 00:16:33,834
Here!

270
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,053
Go ahead Tsuneko.

271
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,522
I think the hall monitor should be
able to run after the kid and catch him.

272
00:16:40,538 --> 00:16:43,436
Then that kid goes back to where
they started and walks slowly.

273
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:44,085
Ooh.

274
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,498
Pick me.

275
00:16:44,514 --> 00:16:45,202
Ooh.

276
00:16:45,218 --> 00:16:45,811
Suzuki.

277
00:16:45,827 --> 00:16:46,795
I'm next...

278
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:51,374
In that case, I think the monitor
should have to go back and start again too.

279
00:16:51,504 --> 00:16:52,470
Yeah, he's right!

280
00:16:52,495 --> 00:16:53,067
Exactly.

281
00:16:53,092 --> 00:16:54,634
Ha! You know it!

282
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,709
I think so too.

283
00:16:55,831 --> 00:16:56,507
Here.

284
00:16:56,522 --> 00:16:57,290
Tsuneko.

285
00:16:58,677 --> 00:17:01,639
I do not think the monitor
should have to go back and walk.

286
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:02,904
And here's why...

287
00:17:04,286 --> 00:17:09,078
The monitor is doing the same thing as a
police car catching someone who is speeding.

288
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,349
That makes sense.

289
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,607
Any objections?

290
00:17:16,717 --> 00:17:18,339
I don't understand any of this.

291
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:21,061
Wait, there're police cars?

292
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:22,464
Yeah, so stop running.

293
00:17:23,392 --> 00:17:28,238
So, monitor can run after people who
run and make them go back and start again.

294
00:17:30,806 --> 00:17:32,730
Unless theirs any other business.

295
00:17:32,857 --> 00:17:33,464
Here.

296
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:34,707
Tsuneko.

297
00:17:35,072 --> 00:17:36,551
Ah, she never stops.

298
00:17:36,566 --> 00:17:37,579
Bossy pants.

299
00:17:37,595 --> 00:17:38,613
Would you just let her talk.

300
00:17:38,629 --> 00:17:41,691
Lately some people aren't eating all there lunch.

301
00:17:42,032 --> 00:17:46,300
The other day I read an article in
a magazine about the war in Vietnam.

302
00:17:46,756 --> 00:17:50,152
There are people in foreign
country's who are very unfortunate.

303
00:17:50,607 --> 00:17:52,135
We are all very lucky.

304
00:17:52,261 --> 00:17:53,873
Lucky to have her!

305
00:17:54,872 --> 00:17:55,752
Ahem.

306
00:17:57,195 --> 00:18:00,498
I believe we have to appreciate
the food we are given, much more.

307
00:18:00,724 --> 00:18:05,646
The rule we have now says, you're allowed
to leave one kind of food on your plates,

308
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,498
but that's spoiling us!

309
00:18:10,654 --> 00:18:12,880
Your a little "Miss. Goody two-shoes."

310
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,670
What's so wrong with leaving just one thing anyway.

311
00:18:15,741 --> 00:18:17,548
Vote to make milk optional.

312
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,209
You can't.

313
00:18:18,225 --> 00:18:19,908
Get someone else to eat it for you.

314
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,240
That is just wrong.

315
00:18:21,242 --> 00:18:23,544
Some kids even hide food inside their trash.

316
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:24,537
None of us!

317
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,709
Why do we have to listen to you anyway?

318
00:18:26,725 --> 00:18:27,488
Order!

319
00:18:27,504 --> 00:18:28,279
Order!

320
00:18:28,295 --> 00:18:30,195
Please raise your hand if you want to speak!

321
00:18:31,064 --> 00:18:33,732
I just can't take it no more!

322
00:18:36,598 --> 00:18:39,779
That night after I'd left my sisters and gone to bed,

323
00:18:40,007 --> 00:18:43,230
one after another, memories from fifth grade

324
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,293
suddenly started flooding back into my mind.

325
00:18:46,318 --> 00:18:46,896
Wait here.

326
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,372
The dog we had..

327
00:18:49,652 --> 00:18:51,487
Track and field day at school..

328
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:57,068
Having nightmares from reading comic books
and longing for an electric pencil-sharpener.

329
00:18:58,544 --> 00:19:02,365
All those tiny things came back so vivid in my mind.

330
00:19:02,704 --> 00:19:05,243
Like a movie was playing inside my head.

331
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:08,521
Almost overpowering my other thoughts.

332
00:19:09,371 --> 00:19:10,615
So clear...

333
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:12,865
I could see it.

334
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,246
Is one of you Taeko Okajima?

335
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,485
That's her.

336
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:29,948
No!

337
00:19:29,963 --> 00:19:30,456
Show me.

338
00:19:38,729 --> 00:19:42,171
We came to tell you that a boy in our
class, Hirota, says that he likes you.

339
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:48,226
Bye.

340
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,094
Let's go tell Hirota we told her.

341
00:19:54,077 --> 00:19:55,151
I knew it.

342
00:19:56,047 --> 00:19:56,928
"Hirota?"

343
00:20:03,388 --> 00:20:04,590
Where-where is it?

344
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:05,841
Right there.

345
00:20:06,024 --> 00:20:09,747
Shuji Hirota loves Taeko Okajima.

346
00:20:09,772 --> 00:20:10,820
They were right.

347
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:13,994
Who is this Hirota guy?

348
00:20:14,265 --> 00:20:15,312
I don't know.

349
00:20:15,398 --> 00:20:16,236
Never heard of him.

350
00:20:16,252 --> 00:20:18,686
Taeko, are you sure you don't know him?

351
00:20:18,724 --> 00:20:21,209
No no, promise.

352
00:20:26,403 --> 00:20:28,570
Excuse me. Which one is Hirota?

353
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:29,930
Look, girls from class 5.

354
00:20:29,946 --> 00:20:31,859
Hirota, someone's here to see you.

355
00:20:34,423 --> 00:20:36,378
Hi. Looking for me?

356
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:40,363
You.. You shouldn't write
things on walls that aren't true.

357
00:20:40,564 --> 00:20:41,242
Huh?

358
00:20:41,244 --> 00:20:42,511
Taeko says you did.

359
00:20:42,872 --> 00:20:44,839
Uh, I.. But I didn't!

360
00:20:44,955 --> 00:20:48,917
But Hiro, you did say you like Taeko in class 5-5.

361
00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:50,099
Uh-uh. Oh yes you did.

362
00:20:50,181 --> 00:20:51,914
That's why we wrote it on the wall.

363
00:20:52,036 --> 00:20:52,685
Huh?!

364
00:20:53,556 --> 00:20:55,929
I really really love her.

365
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,150
Cha cha cha.

366
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,972
But she's way off in the sky.

367
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,077
Cha cha cha.

368
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:03,413
Like a distant star.

369
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:03,886
Goodbye.

370
00:21:03,901 --> 00:21:04,652
Cha cha cha.

371
00:21:04,725 --> 00:21:07,292
I really really love her.

372
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:12,356
Taeko!

373
00:21:14,508 --> 00:21:16,833
We just went and talked to Hirota.

374
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:18,036
Wha?

375
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:20,591
We went ahead and told him for you.

376
00:21:20,607 --> 00:21:22,419
Don't write weird stuff on walls.

377
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:25,099
Tsuneko!

378
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,286
Um–hum...

379
00:21:27,893 --> 00:21:28,818
No running.

380
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:33,052
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

381
00:21:34,097 --> 00:21:34,863
Yeah.

382
00:21:48,561 --> 00:21:49,733
But wasn't it funny?

383
00:21:50,863 --> 00:21:51,936
Over here. C'mon.

384
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:53,924
See right over there?

385
00:21:53,965 --> 00:21:55,241
That's him, Hirota.

386
00:22:01,877 --> 00:22:05,774
Hira, Hirota in 5-4 says he likes Taeko?

387
00:22:06,348 --> 00:22:09,370
He's amazing at baseball. The best pitcher.

388
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:10,798
Really.

389
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:13,829
Tono the only one who can even
come close to getting a hit.

390
00:22:13,945 --> 00:22:15,673
Oh, is that so.

391
00:22:16,971 --> 00:22:19,252
We play them in the next inner class tournament.

392
00:22:26,194 --> 00:22:27,258
Go, go!

393
00:22:27,273 --> 00:22:28,368
Go for it, Tono!

394
00:22:29,054 --> 00:22:30,747
Go, go, go, go, go.

395
00:22:31,573 --> 00:22:32,328
Play ball!

396
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:35,836
C'mon, Tono!

397
00:22:35,852 --> 00:22:37,445
C'mon class 5-4!

398
00:22:37,544 --> 00:22:38,320
Yeah!

399
00:22:40,523 --> 00:22:42,605
Hiro, go for it!

400
00:22:44,205 --> 00:22:46,226
Taeko's watching you know!

401
00:22:55,989 --> 00:22:57,949
Tono, go for it!

402
00:22:57,951 --> 00:22:58,849
Get a hit!

403
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,122
Strike!

404
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,246
It's OK Tono.

405
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:10,513
Way to go Hiro!

406
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,462
Strike him out!

407
00:23:12,608 --> 00:23:15,805
Taeko, you better not be cheering for 5-4.

408
00:23:15,821 --> 00:23:17,173
Why would I do that?

409
00:23:17,768 --> 00:23:18,595
Hit it!

410
00:23:18,804 --> 00:23:21,401
Hit it! Tono rah!!

411
00:23:21,793 --> 00:23:25,142
Hit it! Hit it! Tono rah!!

412
00:23:25,506 --> 00:23:27,113
Hit it! Hit it!

413
00:23:27,348 --> 00:23:27,916
Ooooh!

414
00:23:27,931 --> 00:23:29,559
Go! Go! Go! Go!

415
00:23:30,366 --> 00:23:31,158
Out!

416
00:23:32,061 --> 00:23:33,679
Yeah!

417
00:23:34,266 --> 00:23:38,638
Hiro, Hiro, Hirota! Hiro, Hiro, Hirota!

418
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,272
C'mon Shuji nail it!

419
00:23:41,288 --> 00:23:43,009
Give it the old one leg trick!

420
00:23:45,703 --> 00:23:46,631
Strike!

421
00:23:50,344 --> 00:23:51,174
Strike!

422
00:23:53,523 --> 00:23:53,937
Yeah!

423
00:23:53,952 --> 00:23:54,633
Strike!

424
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:55,810
You're out!

425
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:58,301
Wow!

426
00:24:01,293 --> 00:24:06,220
Hiro, Hiro, Hirota! Hiro, Hiro, Hirota!

427
00:24:06,726 --> 00:24:07,585
Hiro, Hiro..

428
00:24:07,601 --> 00:24:09,788
I didn't know anything about baseball.

429
00:24:10,112 --> 00:24:13,452
But even I could tell, he was superb.

430
00:24:14,876 --> 00:24:15,507
Yeah!

431
00:24:15,726 --> 00:24:16,797
Get it get it!

432
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,936
Hiro, Hiro, Hirota! Hiro, Hiro, Hirota!

433
00:24:26,952 --> 00:24:28,377
What's wrong Taeko?

434
00:24:29,754 --> 00:24:32,067
Between the cold and the excitement,

435
00:24:32,295 --> 00:24:36,154
I ended up going to the bathroom five times.

436
00:24:36,972 --> 00:24:37,463
Safe!

437
00:24:37,478 --> 00:24:38,129
Yeah!

438
00:24:41,872 --> 00:24:43,647
And that's the game!

439
00:24:43,877 --> 00:24:46,587
Woo woo–hoo.

440
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:47,533
Good job.

441
00:24:47,572 --> 00:24:49,235
Class 5-4 wins.

442
00:24:50,243 --> 00:24:51,908
Good game there buddy.

443
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:54,359
Woo–hoo.

444
00:24:54,361 --> 00:24:55,195
Yeah!

445
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,363
Hiro, you were incredible!

446
00:24:58,482 --> 00:25:00,644
This was all your fault Suzuki.

447
00:25:00,868 --> 00:25:01,901
What do you know.

448
00:25:01,903 --> 00:25:03,402
It's not like you helped.

449
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:07,284
If Tono couldn't get a hit off
him, then how was I suppose to.

450
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:10,699
Tono threw it to you and you
missed it and they scored three runs.

451
00:25:10,931 --> 00:25:12,389
It was a wild throw.

452
00:25:12,405 --> 00:25:13,574
No one could have caught that.

453
00:25:14,574 --> 00:25:15,560
Good game.

454
00:25:15,576 --> 00:25:17,812
Hey, coach said he'd buy us all ice cream.

455
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:19,432
That's great!

456
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,192
She's a girl, she doesn't know what she's talking about.

457
00:25:21,194 --> 00:25:22,694
C'mon Taeko's over there.

458
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:23,806
Come on.

459
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,079
Yeah, come on.

460
00:25:26,435 --> 00:25:29,275
Actually I, um, need to go home.

461
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:29,877
Better hurry.

462
00:25:29,892 --> 00:25:31,173
Hurry up she's leaving.

463
00:25:31,189 --> 00:25:32,857
What's the matter now, Taeko?

464
00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:38,665
It's to late, she ran away.

465
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:28,065
Um...

466
00:26:29,668 --> 00:26:29,995
Di...

467
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:38,717
I... what?

468
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,995
Er... Th... Th.. Owee.

469
00:26:48,456 --> 00:26:49,807
Eh cloudy...

470
00:26:50,063 --> 00:26:50,579
Huh?

471
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,463
Do you like sun or clouds?

472
00:26:53,234 --> 00:26:54,846
A sunny day or a cloudy day?

473
00:26:56,189 --> 00:26:57,619
Which do you like best?

474
00:27:06,716 --> 00:27:07,087
Cl...

475
00:27:09,644 --> 00:27:10,470
Cloudy.

476
00:27:11,367 --> 00:27:13,017
Yeah, me too!

477
00:28:52,692 --> 00:28:55,997
A sunny day or a cloudy day?

478
00:28:56,217 --> 00:28:56,958
Cloudy...

479
00:28:58,231 --> 00:28:59,434
Cloudy or sunny?

480
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:03,279
Yeah, me too.

481
00:29:21,748 --> 00:29:25,540
I didn't intend to bring my fifth
grade self along with me on this trip.

482
00:29:25,914 --> 00:29:28,485
But clearly she was along for the ride.

483
00:29:33,879 --> 00:29:35,172
She was always around.

484
00:30:06,434 --> 00:30:08,615
But why fifth grade I wonder?

485
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:16,681
The boys will play baseball in
Phys-Ed, the girls assemble in the gym.

486
00:30:16,697 --> 00:30:17,595
Huh?

487
00:30:17,611 --> 00:30:18,485
Come on he said the gym...

488
00:30:18,501 --> 00:30:20,002
C'mon guys lets play baseball.

489
00:30:20,517 --> 00:30:21,597
C'mon let's go! C'mon.

490
00:30:22,231 --> 00:30:23,791
Take it Tonoooo.

491
00:30:31,255 --> 00:30:34,529
Today, I have something very important to tell you.

492
00:30:38,582 --> 00:30:42,288
Soon your all going to graduate from elementary school,

493
00:30:42,745 --> 00:30:45,151
go on to middle and then high school.

494
00:30:45,558 --> 00:30:48,487
And when you grow up, then you will have babies.

495
00:30:49,023 --> 00:30:53,882
A woman's body, your body, goes
through changes to prepare you for this.

496
00:30:55,626 --> 00:30:56,324
Come on.

497
00:30:57,442 --> 00:30:58,953
Come on over here.

498
00:31:01,366 --> 00:31:02,437
Did you know?

499
00:31:02,671 --> 00:31:03,145
Mm.

500
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:04,388
Who told you?

501
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:08,507
My mother explained it all to me last summer.

502
00:31:08,717 --> 00:31:10,794
I'm what you call an early-developer.

503
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:11,765
"Early" what?

504
00:31:11,781 --> 00:31:12,711
Developer.

505
00:31:13,484 --> 00:31:17,109
My mom said that bigger and
taller girls get theirs earlier.

506
00:31:17,214 --> 00:31:19,795
I bet those those girls already have um'.

507
00:31:21,502 --> 00:31:23,295
Well, some of them, probably.

508
00:31:23,931 --> 00:31:24,734
Oh.

509
00:31:26,257 --> 00:31:27,599
Hey, that's good.

510
00:31:27,723 --> 00:31:28,556
Hey.

511
00:31:29,842 --> 00:31:30,750
You gonna buy um?

512
00:31:30,835 --> 00:31:31,633
I think so.

513
00:31:31,772 --> 00:31:32,625
I knew it.

514
00:31:33,344 --> 00:31:35,039
Your buying some aren't you Taeko?

515
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:37,821
Um.

516
00:31:38,216 --> 00:31:40,050
I think it' actually a good idea.

517
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:43,036
And everyone going to need them eventually.

518
00:31:43,227 --> 00:31:44,992
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

519
00:31:45,221 --> 00:31:46,398
Yeah, she's right.

520
00:31:59,507 --> 00:32:03,511
Hey, why are the girls buying some
sort of special underpants from the nurse.

521
00:32:04,414 --> 00:32:04,894
What?

522
00:32:06,448 --> 00:32:08,472
Soo, did you know that?

523
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,683
No.

524
00:32:10,468 --> 00:32:11,581
Is that really true?

525
00:32:13,297 --> 00:32:14,730
Why would you do that?

526
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,527
You should mind your own business.

527
00:32:17,877 --> 00:32:18,464
Yeah.

528
00:32:19,318 --> 00:32:21,605
Why does the school nurse sell underpants?

529
00:32:23,414 --> 00:32:24,011
What?

530
00:32:26,169 --> 00:32:28,269
You told one of the boys. How could you?

531
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,046
Why would you do something like that?

532
00:32:30,062 --> 00:32:32,097
You can't tell stuff like that to boys.

533
00:32:32,252 --> 00:32:35,003
Rie, it's a secret just for girls.

534
00:32:39,646 --> 00:32:42,800
Rie likes Nakayama. I'll bet that's why she told him.

535
00:32:42,992 --> 00:32:45,573
You can't trust boys even if you have a crush on them.

536
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:46,707
Do you under stand?

537
00:32:46,722 --> 00:32:47,289
Uh-huh.

538
00:32:50,614 --> 00:32:51,656
What's going on?

539
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,334
Rie went and told Nakayama all
about us getting out periods.

540
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:56,955
That terrible.

541
00:32:57,529 --> 00:32:59,689
And he's been telling everyone.

542
00:33:00,175 --> 00:33:01,636
He promised he wouldn't tell.

543
00:33:01,744 --> 00:33:03,875
Boy's never keep there promises.

544
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:05,348
Right?

545
00:33:05,944 --> 00:33:06,737
Right!

546
00:33:07,636 --> 00:33:08,722
Oh my goodness.

547
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:10,894
Boys are all immature and disgusting.

548
00:33:11,552 --> 00:33:13,438
And now they won't leave us alone.

549
00:33:13,739 --> 00:33:14,529
Panties.

550
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:15,735
Hey!

551
00:33:17,836 --> 00:33:18,991
Perverts!

552
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:20,126
Dress up day!

553
00:33:20,142 --> 00:33:22,917
Sure enough, looking up skirts was all the rage

554
00:33:23,022 --> 00:33:25,188
and periods became an obsession.

555
00:33:25,485 --> 00:33:26,735
You have a period.

556
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:27,592
Oh!

557
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:29,757
You're crazy.

558
00:33:29,773 --> 00:33:30,749
No, stop it!

559
00:33:30,965 --> 00:33:33,493
I wonder what were gonna do next "period".

560
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:34,559
Stupid.

561
00:33:34,843 --> 00:33:36,066
Ow, that hurt.

562
00:33:36,082 --> 00:33:37,905
You got a filthy mind you know!

563
00:33:38,095 --> 00:33:38,968
Hey! Cut it out!

564
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:39,398
Jerk!

565
00:33:39,414 --> 00:33:40,520
You're on your period.

566
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:41,946
I am not!

567
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,939
Oh! Rie and her big mouth.

568
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:45,558
Yeah.

569
00:33:45,626 --> 00:33:46,018
Owl.

570
00:33:51,045 --> 00:33:51,828
I'm sorry.

571
00:33:52,244 --> 00:33:52,914
For what?

572
00:33:53,648 --> 00:33:55,468
I shouldn't have told him about it.

573
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,304
It's no big deal.

574
00:33:58,237 --> 00:33:59,289
It seems to be.

575
00:33:59,315 --> 00:34:02,039
The nurse said it's perfectly normal but every ones angry.

576
00:34:02,334 --> 00:34:03,539
Well, I'm not angry.

577
00:34:04,671 --> 00:34:07,000
I started getting mine in fourth grade.

578
00:34:07,456 --> 00:34:08,765
Huh? You what?

579
00:34:09,788 --> 00:34:12,883
So I, skip gym class occasionally.

580
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,613
You can't do PE when you have your period?

581
00:34:15,781 --> 00:34:18,695
I guess. My mom sends a note to the school.

582
00:34:20,182 --> 00:34:24,359
Nakayama said that he felt sorry for
all the trouble we have to go through.

583
00:34:24,887 --> 00:34:27,043
Rie! You told him you skipped PE?!

584
00:34:27,597 --> 00:34:28,289
Uh-huh.

585
00:34:28,887 --> 00:34:32,625
First, I made him promise he wouldn't
tell any of the other boys but...

586
00:34:32,788 --> 00:34:33,773
But that means!

587
00:34:34,344 --> 00:34:37,742
That they think every girl skipping PE is on her period!

588
00:34:38,508 --> 00:34:38,984
No!

589
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,914
Rie!

590
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:42,501
Really, you think so?

591
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:43,883
What?

592
00:34:53,187 --> 00:34:55,083
I'd really rather not miss gym.

593
00:34:55,085 --> 00:34:55,804
Since when?

594
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,601
You don't want your cough to get any worse do you?

595
00:34:58,938 --> 00:35:00,047
Then I'll stay home.

596
00:35:00,437 --> 00:35:02,515
You have no fever, so go to school.

597
00:35:02,574 --> 00:35:04,086
Then I'll go to gym class.

598
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:05,623
Suit yourself...

599
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,676
But don't come crying to me if it gets worse.

600
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,759
See you later.

601
00:35:15,173 --> 00:35:18,404
When did she suddenly get so interested in phys ed?

602
00:35:24,572 --> 00:35:26,544
Taeko, your face is red.

603
00:35:27,242 --> 00:35:28,755
Huh? Oh yeah.

604
00:35:28,771 --> 00:35:29,763
Are you okay?

605
00:35:30,522 --> 00:35:31,715
I caught a cold.

606
00:35:31,771 --> 00:35:32,966
You look feverish.

607
00:35:32,982 --> 00:35:34,539
You shouldn't go to gym class.

608
00:35:34,555 --> 00:35:35,472
Sit it out.

609
00:35:36,258 --> 00:35:37,245
I'll go tell them.

610
00:35:37,949 --> 00:35:38,806
Stop.

611
00:35:39,101 --> 00:35:39,986
How come?

612
00:35:40,992 --> 00:35:42,708
I got a note from home.

613
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,754
O-K. Then it's no problem.

614
00:35:47,476 --> 00:35:47,966
Right?

615
00:35:49,279 --> 00:35:50,556
Coming through.

616
00:35:57,364 --> 00:35:59,255
I'm not going to gym class ether.

617
00:35:59,534 --> 00:36:00,649
We're both the same.

618
00:36:08,459 --> 00:36:09,104
Oh.

619
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:11,948
I love playing dodge ball.

620
00:36:12,433 --> 00:36:13,393
Incoming.

621
00:36:17,205 --> 00:36:19,050
Uh... Rie?

622
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:20,534
Um...

623
00:36:21,154 --> 00:36:23,268
Are you on your period?

624
00:36:23,429 --> 00:36:24,011
Uh-huh.

625
00:36:24,697 --> 00:36:25,464
I see.

626
00:36:25,699 --> 00:36:26,512
Uh...

627
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,897
I'm not on my period. I have a cold.

628
00:36:28,913 --> 00:36:31,639
I know that. You're not an early developer.

629
00:36:31,842 --> 00:36:34,248
Yup', I'm here because I'm sick.

630
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,324
A period isn't a sickness. I could still play.

631
00:36:43,198 --> 00:36:46,270
It's just that... My mom would prefer that I not join in.

632
00:36:47,234 --> 00:36:47,631
Oh.

633
00:36:49,279 --> 00:36:51,193
Leave it alone period girls!

634
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:51,717
Huh?

635
00:36:52,979 --> 00:36:54,146
Don't touch it!

636
00:36:54,693 --> 00:36:57,678
Boy, that was close. I could'a caught your period.

637
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,076
It's a cold.

638
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,186
Hey, over here.

639
00:37:02,202 --> 00:37:03,521
"Caught your period."

640
00:37:04,425 --> 00:37:06,561
Periods are not contagious.

641
00:37:08,391 --> 00:37:09,678
What an idiot.

642
00:37:14,258 --> 00:37:15,889
Will you stop it! It's not that funny!

643
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,394
Taeko?

644
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:29,958
Hey look, it's the period pair!

645
00:37:29,974 --> 00:37:31,177
I am not!

646
00:37:32,225 --> 00:37:32,904
Pervert.

647
00:37:42,172 --> 00:37:44,758
Rie, how can you stand that?

648
00:37:45,091 --> 00:37:49,688
Well, my mom said that having your
period it's nothing to be ashamed of.

649
00:37:50,716 --> 00:37:53,149
Well, yeah... I guess so.

650
00:37:57,308 --> 00:38:01,386
To be a butterfly the caterpillar
has to become a chrysalis first.

651
00:38:02,017 --> 00:38:05,222
Even if it never, for a moment, wanted to become one.

652
00:38:08,594 --> 00:38:11,000
Was I remembering those days so clearly

653
00:38:11,395 --> 00:38:13,563
because I need to become a chrysalis again?

654
00:38:14,956 --> 00:38:18,071
Certainly things felt different from when I started work.

655
00:38:19,008 --> 00:38:23,375
At work and at play we girls seemed
to have a lot more fun than the boys.

656
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:26,430
We felt as if we had taken flight.

657
00:38:27,751 --> 00:38:29,261
But thinking about it now..

658
00:38:30,338 --> 00:38:31,997
Maybe we were all in a trance.

659
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:34,792
Just flapping our wings.

660
00:38:54,906 --> 00:38:59,844
Perhaps my fifth grade self is trying to
tell me to try to find a new way to fly.

661
00:39:02,895 --> 00:39:04,941
Anyway I need to get some sleep.

662
00:39:05,473 --> 00:39:07,496
Not much time before I get to Yokatta.

663
00:40:04,131 --> 00:40:05,506
Ah! Woh!

664
00:40:06,351 --> 00:40:07,182
Aaah.

665
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:11,901
No-no-no-no...

666
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:12,978
Augh!

667
00:40:15,348 --> 00:40:15,882
Ah?

668
00:40:16,295 --> 00:40:18,243
Was that.. Was that the Tokyo train?

669
00:40:18,245 --> 00:40:20,104
Mm, sorry you missed it.

670
00:40:24,629 --> 00:40:25,349
Augh!

671
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,353
Hey, are you Taeko?

672
00:40:31,546 --> 00:40:32,244
Uh-huh.

673
00:40:35,327 --> 00:40:36,226
I'll take this.

674
00:40:36,752 --> 00:40:38,999
Uh-uh. W-wait a second. Who are you?

675
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:41,312
Eh? Oh, you don't remember?

676
00:40:42,552 --> 00:40:44,385
Oh, well, I don't know why you would.

677
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:49,479
I'm Toshio. Er, second cousin of Kazuo.

678
00:40:51,322 --> 00:40:52,309
Oh.

679
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:54,645
Is that who you are?

680
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,011
Yeah.

681
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:00,901
Oh dear..

682
00:41:01,607 --> 00:41:02,315
Uhh...

683
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,322
Is there something wrong?

684
00:41:04,794 --> 00:41:05,518
Nothing.

685
00:41:06,451 --> 00:41:07,369
I just..

686
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:11,455
I just... I thought you were a bag snatcher.

687
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:12,481
Eh?

688
00:41:15,283 --> 00:41:16,130
That's crazy.

689
00:41:16,637 --> 00:41:17,981
Didn't you hear me call out to you?

690
00:41:19,072 --> 00:41:20,831
Oh yes.. I did.

691
00:41:21,843 --> 00:41:22,927
I just didn't think.

692
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:26,684
I... I'm terribly sorry.

693
00:41:27,464 --> 00:41:29,196
Yeah, it's OK.

694
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:32,966
So, where is Kazuo?

695
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:37,263
Oh, eh... He.. Suddenly called and
asked me if I'd come to pick you up.

696
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:40,301
Looks like it's been raining?

697
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,184
Yeah, but it should clear up today.

698
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:47,012
I.. Guess I should've borrowed my dad's car.

699
00:41:49,914 --> 00:41:51,027
But I like driving this.

700
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:56,829
There's room for two. Hop in.

701
00:41:58,281 --> 00:41:58,921
Thanks.

702
00:42:11,116 --> 00:42:11,856
Oh...

703
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:13,881
Is this music all right?

704
00:42:14,345 --> 00:42:15,303
Sure. Yeah.

705
00:42:45,525 --> 00:42:47,836
So, this music, it's certainly different.

706
00:42:48,555 --> 00:42:51,539
Yeah, it's a 5 piece band from
Hungarian called Music Hash.

707
00:42:52,884 --> 00:42:53,516
Hungary?

708
00:42:54,769 --> 00:42:56,789
You're into music like this?

709
00:42:57,191 --> 00:42:57,937
Just a bit.

710
00:42:58,262 --> 00:42:59,008
Peasant music.

711
00:42:59,464 --> 00:43:00,969
Because you know, that's what I am.

712
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,117
That's cool.

713
00:43:04,409 --> 00:43:04,977
Think so?

714
00:43:04,992 --> 00:43:05,428
Uh-hum.

715
00:43:28,396 --> 00:43:31,511
You do remember the harvest party last year at Castawo's.

716
00:43:31,527 --> 00:43:32,286
That was fun.

717
00:43:32,804 --> 00:43:34,356
Uhhh-huh?

718
00:43:34,764 --> 00:43:37,708
And a bunch of young guys stooped by if you recall?

719
00:43:39,178 --> 00:43:39,982
Not at all.

720
00:43:41,675 --> 00:43:45,137
OK, maybe you can remember one particular guy.

721
00:43:45,822 --> 00:43:46,606
Still, no?

722
00:43:47,151 --> 00:43:48,649
Have a good look at this face.

723
00:43:48,873 --> 00:43:50,274
Oh! Uhh!

724
00:43:51,531 --> 00:43:52,098
Sorry!

725
00:44:02,357 --> 00:44:05,229
So, you came to help pick safflower?

726
00:44:06,786 --> 00:44:09,003
You must be interested in dyeing fabric then?

727
00:44:09,388 --> 00:44:10,349
Not really.

728
00:44:10,366 --> 00:44:14,204
For some reason I just love the idea
of picking safflower like they used to.

729
00:44:14,784 --> 00:44:17,520
Of course, living up here you
must know all about these things.

730
00:44:17,674 --> 00:44:19,690
Well, mostly you just hear of it.

731
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:22,088
Once upon a time this area was famous for it.

732
00:44:22,543 --> 00:44:23,971
I've never grown it, that's for sure.

733
00:44:25,034 --> 00:44:27,534
But it was huge in the samurai days right?

734
00:44:27,668 --> 00:44:29,823
Yeah, The Safflower Barons.

735
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:32,540
The ones who profited made a fortune

736
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,659
but for the peasant it was just another crop.

737
00:44:37,235 --> 00:44:42,735
Do you know: Whose fair complexion
will this flower of crimson one day adorn.

738
00:44:43,488 --> 00:44:47,299
Yeah, A Haiku by Basho. I looked it up before I came.

739
00:44:47,747 --> 00:44:48,721
Oh, you did?

740
00:44:48,736 --> 00:44:49,331
Yeah.

741
00:44:50,762 --> 00:44:52,189
I just looked it up last night.

742
00:44:55,682 --> 00:44:58,010
But you know, the same book said,

743
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:03,548
that the women who picked the flowers could never in
their lives wear or afford the rouge that it came from.

744
00:45:14,112 --> 00:45:15,849
Is this where they have The Summer Festival?

745
00:45:15,961 --> 00:45:18,656
Yeah, the river bank is packed with people.

746
00:45:30,482 --> 00:45:33,961
The newspapers say, that
agriculture is having a hard time.

747
00:45:34,015 --> 00:45:34,796
Is that right?

748
00:45:34,813 --> 00:45:36,171
It is, absolutely.

749
00:45:36,187 --> 00:45:39,887
We've got crop quotas, we've got
free trade, we've got fewer fields.

750
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:42,383
If it goes on like this there won't be any farms left.

751
00:45:43,313 --> 00:45:43,859
You know...

752
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:46,354
There's no job that isn't tough,

753
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:49,719
so, you do what you have to do
and in the end somehow you get by.

754
00:45:50,127 --> 00:45:52,078
Do you think it's the same these days in the city?

755
00:45:53,169 --> 00:45:53,851
Yeah.

756
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:57,992
But I find a lot less people
there really live for their work.

757
00:45:59,292 --> 00:46:00,703
And how about you Taeko?

758
00:46:02,435 --> 00:46:03,030
Me?

759
00:46:03,046 --> 00:46:03,836
Uh-hum.

760
00:46:05,405 --> 00:46:07,648
I suppose I am one of them.

761
00:46:08,885 --> 00:46:10,883
My jobs alright for a 9 to 5.

762
00:46:12,773 --> 00:46:15,320
For me, I could farm all day and night.

763
00:46:15,727 --> 00:46:19,108
Yup', it's wonderful raising
things that are alive on the land.

764
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:21,812
You mean like cows?

765
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:23,211
Huh?

766
00:46:25,762 --> 00:46:26,455
Not that.

767
00:46:27,103 --> 00:46:29,939
Sure we have some animals, but look over there, see that?

768
00:46:30,186 --> 00:46:34,501
Apples, cherries. They're all alive.

769
00:46:34,669 --> 00:46:35,173
Hum.

770
00:46:35,589 --> 00:46:36,244
Uh-huh.

771
00:46:36,629 --> 00:46:41,218
The way I see it, if I take good care of them
they'll pick up on that and do their best for me.

772
00:46:46,258 --> 00:46:48,304
Oh... I guess I got carried away.

773
00:46:48,394 --> 00:46:50,316
Naw, I get what you mean.

774
00:46:50,885 --> 00:46:52,121
I think it's lovely.

775
00:46:52,634 --> 00:46:55,770
To tell you the truth, even
though my parents worked on a farm.

776
00:46:55,942 --> 00:46:57,246
I only just gotten into it.

777
00:46:57,853 --> 00:46:59,816
It's all recently I worked in an office.

778
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:02,395
Oh, a major career change.

779
00:47:02,411 --> 00:47:02,988
Uh-huh.

780
00:47:03,707 --> 00:47:05,777
More like an entire life change.

781
00:47:05,793 --> 00:47:08,191
You need to be seriously into it.

782
00:47:09,146 --> 00:47:12,660
My friend convinced me to go into
business with him on an organic farm.

783
00:47:13,717 --> 00:47:17,082
I.. Guess you could say I've gone back to my roots.

784
00:47:17,796 --> 00:47:19,356
What do you mean by organic?

785
00:47:19,981 --> 00:47:21,183
Ahem!

786
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:25,434
"One must be organized to be organic."

787
00:47:26,724 --> 00:47:28,146
But you know I wish I was.

788
00:47:28,598 --> 00:47:29,809
It's simply all natural.

789
00:47:30,346 --> 00:47:33,358
Oh, we still use machines but hardly any pesticide.

790
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:35,152
And use manure to fertilize.

791
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:39,445
Oh yeah, I've seen labels that say:
"No chemicals used" or "low chemicals."

792
00:47:39,877 --> 00:47:42,320
Well, you can forget all those fancy labels,

793
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:47,187
in the organic you encourage the life-force
that all living things have naturally

794
00:47:47,203 --> 00:47:49,636
we simply assist in the process.

795
00:47:49,695 --> 00:47:51,854
Its a very cool way of farmer.*

796
00:47:53,751 --> 00:47:56,976
Only that "simply assisting" there is never that simple.

797
00:48:03,738 --> 00:48:06,190
They said to bring you straight out to the fields.

798
00:48:06,774 --> 00:48:07,344
Really?

799
00:48:07,573 --> 00:48:09,446
Yup', I'm going right to work.

800
00:48:09,501 --> 00:48:11,767
Now? Are you sure your up for that?

801
00:48:12,006 --> 00:48:13,298
I slept on the train.

802
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,025
Besides, your suppose to pick the
safflower when the dew is still on them.

803
00:48:17,255 --> 00:48:19,099
And the thorns are still soft, right?

804
00:48:19,299 --> 00:48:20,568
I suppose but...

805
00:48:20,873 --> 00:48:22,074
I'm a bit of a night owl,

806
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:25,475
so I booked an over-night train to help
me make a quick shift to getting up early.

807
00:48:25,591 --> 00:48:28,510
Wow! Your really here to work!

808
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,136
There they are!

809
00:49:55,482 --> 00:49:57,086
Good morning, everyone!

810
00:50:06,473 --> 00:50:08,832
Taeko, it's so nice to see you.

811
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:10,722
Here I am again.

812
00:50:12,808 --> 00:50:16,923
Hello grandma, you're looking very well as always.

813
00:50:17,143 --> 00:50:19,500
You don't look so bad yourself.

814
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,687
Not tired from your trip?

815
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:23,273
Naw, I feel fine.

816
00:50:23,316 --> 00:50:26,318
Your sure you don't want to go
back to the house first for a nap.

817
00:50:26,383 --> 00:50:29,125
No really, look, I'm good to go.

818
00:50:29,336 --> 00:50:33,672
Oh my. Traditional work pants. You really are ready.

819
00:50:34,854 --> 00:50:37,257
And they're the only ones I brought with me.

820
00:50:37,764 --> 00:50:39,090
Well, look at you.

821
00:50:39,335 --> 00:50:43,327
These days you hardly ever see
the girls around here wearing those.

822
00:50:43,502 --> 00:50:46,705
You look more like a farmer than they do.

823
00:50:46,971 --> 00:50:48,591
She sure does.

824
00:51:11,387 --> 00:51:12,740
Hey, farm girl!

825
00:51:14,975 --> 00:51:16,170
Toshio!

826
00:51:21,546 --> 00:51:24,880
And so I began my second taste of country life.

827
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:35,716
I always wondered how they produced a vibrant
vivid red from such a simple yellow flower.

828
00:51:36,595 --> 00:51:39,841
According to folklore, before they had protective gloves,

829
00:51:40,059 --> 00:51:43,447
young farm girls would harvest
the pedals with their bare hands.

830
00:51:44,512 --> 00:51:46,861
The thorns could prick them mercilessly

831
00:51:47,088 --> 00:51:49,776
and their blood was said to turn into the deepest crimson.

832
00:51:51,313 --> 00:51:56,557
I imagine those girls unable to afford to paint
they're lips red with the very rouge they had created.

833
00:51:57,971 --> 00:52:01,111
I manage them jealous of the fancy girls from the city.

834
00:52:03,073 --> 00:52:06,484
It took sixty baskets of pedals
to make a handful of rouge.

835
00:52:07,167 --> 00:52:10,988
Ironic that a golden flower, once transformed into red,

836
00:52:11,516 --> 00:52:14,887
was quite literally worth it's weight in gold.

837
00:53:47,425 --> 00:53:48,313
It's amazing,

838
00:53:49,366 --> 00:53:52,649
the pedals were rinsed then crushed into a paste.

839
00:53:53,632 --> 00:53:58,602
With enough air and water the pedals
oxidized and gradually turned more red.

840
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:04,899
In two or three days the mushed-up
pedals ferment and go completely red

841
00:54:05,344 --> 00:54:06,469
and turn sticky.

842
00:54:09,328 --> 00:54:13,445
After the paste has been pounded in
a mortar and rolled into an egg shape.

843
00:54:13,676 --> 00:54:19,367
It's dried in the sun and finally
it can be used as the bases for rouge.

844
00:54:23,395 --> 00:54:26,661
Even the liquid from pressing
the yellow pedals isn't wasted.

845
00:54:27,136 --> 00:54:30,255
Every last drop is squeezed out and saved.

846
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:33,919
It is then used for safflower dyeing of cloth.

847
00:54:34,049 --> 00:54:36,696
Dye, dye we are off to dye.

848
00:54:36,804 --> 00:54:39,458
We dip it in the color. Dip it good and let it dry.

849
00:54:39,512 --> 00:54:42,336
Safflower will no longer make us cry.

850
00:54:42,352 --> 00:54:44,700
Those poor village girls way back when.

851
00:54:45,009 --> 00:54:49,083
Would bring color into their world
with this so called waste product.

852
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:58,132
They would dye cotton and linen bright beautiful pink.

853
00:55:00,776 --> 00:55:01,657
Wow!

854
00:55:04,109 --> 00:55:07,180
Now mechanization has reduced the amount of labor.

855
00:55:07,614 --> 00:55:10,774
But the pedals still need harvesting by hand, every day.

856
00:55:40,783 --> 00:55:44,469
Rouge cakes soon mold, and the flowers wait for no one.

857
00:55:45,489 --> 00:55:48,031
When you look back over the flowers you've picked

858
00:55:48,288 --> 00:55:50,336
suddenly new ones have come into bloom.

859
00:55:52,612 --> 00:55:55,971
In the rainy season your soaked without letup

860
00:55:55,987 --> 00:55:58,828
and sometimes work goes on all night.

861
00:56:02,005 --> 00:56:03,851
The days have flown by,

862
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:07,859
I'm tired in a deeply satisfying way.

863
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:12,207
I feel a little like one of
those flower-picking girls of old.

864
00:56:13,424 --> 00:56:16,404
If I'd had the chance to help
out like this when I was a girl,

865
00:56:16,896 --> 00:56:19,037
I'd have written an essay about my own life.

866
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:21,318
Not just about something I'd read.

867
00:56:37,116 --> 00:56:39,347
Hey mom, can I have 5,000 yen.

868
00:56:39,501 --> 00:56:42,891
¥5,000? For what? Do I look like I'm made out of money?

869
00:56:42,907 --> 00:56:46,108
Mom, no but. Well... You said
you'd buy me some new running shoes.

870
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:48,226
Running shoes can't cost that much?

871
00:56:48,228 --> 00:56:49,344
Yes, they do.

872
00:56:49,346 --> 00:56:50,206
No, they don't.

873
00:56:50,222 --> 00:56:51,659
Well, Pumas sure do.

874
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:52,769
Pumas?

875
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:54,362
Yes Puma.

876
00:56:56,408 --> 00:56:58,665
Well anyway, I've never heard of them.

877
00:56:59,218 --> 00:57:00,773
There must be cheaper ones.

878
00:57:01,514 --> 00:57:03,172
What's wrong with the ones you have now?

879
00:57:03,327 --> 00:57:05,727
Nobody wears those stupid old things now.

880
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,289
You begged me for those.

881
00:57:07,309 --> 00:57:09,350
Everybody is getting Pumas.

882
00:57:09,489 --> 00:57:10,656
Who's everybody?

883
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:14,509
Kako and Megu and then theirs Yachan and Nonchan.

884
00:57:14,525 --> 00:57:16,359
What? That's only four.

885
00:57:16,784 --> 00:57:19,094
Well, it's more than just them. It's everyone.

886
00:57:19,476 --> 00:57:20,726
I don't think so.

887
00:57:21,148 --> 00:57:22,679
Maybe if you helped out more.

888
00:57:22,695 --> 00:57:24,312
Mom! Mom...

889
00:57:24,328 --> 00:57:26,695
You got him to buy your doll another dress.

890
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:28,445
It's not even your birthday.

891
00:57:31,588 --> 00:57:33,760
Didn't you say it would only
be for Christmas and birthdays?

892
00:57:34,142 --> 00:57:36,361
Dad, your spoiling Taeko rotten.

893
00:57:37,517 --> 00:57:39,010
Do I spoil you little bear?

894
00:57:39,329 --> 00:57:42,174
All of a sudden, my fifth grade self was back.

895
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:44,689
But uh...

896
00:57:46,142 --> 00:57:50,705
How come Yaeko got a brand new
kimono? It wasn't even her birthday.

897
00:57:50,721 --> 00:57:51,986
That was for a show.

898
00:57:52,181 --> 00:57:55,142
Your always asking father for little things all the time,

899
00:57:55,188 --> 00:57:57,963
but he buys us one big thing now and then.

900
00:57:58,681 --> 00:57:59,197
Right?

901
00:57:59,489 --> 00:58:00,132
Right.

902
00:58:04,665 --> 00:58:06,723
Taeko, you stop that,

903
00:58:07,365 --> 00:58:09,301
and eat what you are given.

904
00:58:10,703 --> 00:58:12,922
Daddy eats my onions, right dad?

905
00:58:13,292 --> 00:58:13,797
Uh-huh.

906
00:58:15,086 --> 00:58:19,679
What's the big deal anyway, everybody knows
that your gonna get that kimono eventually.

907
00:58:20,436 --> 00:58:21,912
Another hand-me-down.

908
00:58:22,109 --> 00:58:24,687
A lot of kids don't even have hand-me-downs.

909
00:58:25,029 --> 00:58:25,933
Exactly.

910
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:28,605
Then you can finally give me that enamel handbag.

911
00:58:28,688 --> 00:58:30,703
I thought I told you to give that to her.

912
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:32,148
You're still hanging on to that.

913
00:58:32,773 --> 00:58:34,734
That's for babies. Give it to her.

914
00:58:42,635 --> 00:58:43,738
No thanks.

915
00:58:45,297 --> 00:58:46,738
I don't even.. Like it.

916
00:58:49,682 --> 00:58:51,636
You don't? Fine I'll keep it.

917
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:54,440
Taeko, I'm not buying you a new one.

918
00:58:54,602 --> 00:58:55,644
Who cares.

919
00:58:56,467 --> 00:58:57,699
Humph, I'm glad.

920
00:58:57,971 --> 00:59:00,183
Now I get to keep it for sentimental reasons.

921
00:59:00,406 --> 00:59:02,089
Oh yeah! I hate it now!

922
00:59:06,135 --> 00:59:09,135
Next course. Take these away.

923
00:59:09,474 --> 00:59:11,596
You see, they get thrown out.

924
00:59:12,099 --> 00:59:13,487
That is such a waste.

925
00:59:15,249 --> 00:59:17,929
No don't. Don't throw them away!

926
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,161
You should know better.

927
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,877
Eat it your self then it won't go to waste.

928
00:59:23,721 --> 00:59:26,010
All of you girls are so selfish.

929
00:59:38,399 --> 00:59:42,045
Daddy, I need a new enamel bag.

930
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,803
Because Yaeko won't give me hers.

931
00:59:47,134 --> 00:59:49,176
Well, that's because you said you didn't want it.

932
00:59:51,085 --> 00:59:52,752
Yeah, but uh...

933
00:59:53,129 --> 00:59:55,048
You have to stand by what you say.

934
01:00:03,234 --> 01:00:05,139
Go on, hurry and get ready.

935
01:00:08,508 --> 01:00:10,512
Yeah, I think I'm gonna wear these shoes.

936
01:00:12,592 --> 01:00:15,664
Mom, why does she have to come too?

937
01:00:17,077 --> 01:00:19,398
You told me it was gonna be just us.

938
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,618
Just you, me and daddy.

939
01:00:23,139 --> 01:00:24,962
I've done all my homework.

940
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,530
Is there some sort of problem?

941
01:00:27,673 --> 01:00:29,346
We're going out for Chinese.

942
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,271
It's much more fun if we all go.

943
01:00:31,273 --> 01:00:33,923
In that case then, grandma should come with us too.

944
01:00:33,939 --> 01:00:36,670
Grandma says Chinese food is too oily.

945
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:39,102
If you don't wanna come, you can stay home.

946
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:06,796
Come on Taeko we're going.

947
01:01:08,352 --> 01:01:09,921
Hurry up you slowpoke.

948
01:01:12,595 --> 01:01:14,846
I can't go, I don't have a purse.

949
01:01:17,026 --> 01:01:19,866
Yaeko, lend your sister your enamel purse.

950
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:45,855
Here.

951
01:01:47,671 --> 01:01:48,878
Oww-a.

952
01:01:49,233 --> 01:01:50,642
Come on, we're ready.

953
01:01:50,784 --> 01:01:51,944
I'm not going!

954
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:54,592
Your not. Let's go mother.

955
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:58,021
Fine you can stay here with your grandma.

956
01:02:04,741 --> 01:02:06,751
Are you not coming my little bear?

957
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:07,925
Never!

958
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:27,421
Let's go.

959
01:02:37,175 --> 01:02:38,261
I'm coming!

960
01:02:51,922 --> 01:02:52,963
No shoes!

961
01:02:58,138 --> 01:03:00,041
Stop that! Please stop!

962
01:03:25,495 --> 01:03:26,869
She lost a button.

963
01:03:39,965 --> 01:03:41,530
We stayed home, of course.

964
01:03:42,199 --> 01:03:43,273
My cheek swelled up.

965
01:03:43,395 --> 01:03:46,405
My mom gave me a cold towel but it wouldn't stop stinging.

966
01:03:47,498 --> 01:03:50,007
All that night I lay in my bed wondering..

967
01:03:50,445 --> 01:03:52,019
Why am I being singled out?

968
01:03:52,035 --> 01:03:53,468
I must be adopted.

969
01:03:53,484 --> 01:03:55,585
I was sure of it. Absolutely sure.

970
01:03:56,392 --> 01:03:58,202
I cried myself to sleep that night.

971
01:03:59,481 --> 01:04:02,827
Was that the first time.. That your dad ever hit you?

972
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,030
That was the first and the last.

973
01:04:08,181 --> 01:04:10,127
Dad slaps me sometimes.

974
01:04:10,544 --> 01:04:12,661
Not that often though and not that hard.

975
01:04:13,107 --> 01:04:15,466
It might be better if it happens now and again.

976
01:04:16,137 --> 01:04:19,818
Only once and you wondern' why it had happened just then.

977
01:04:20,663 --> 01:04:22,865
It's hard to believe that you behaved like that.

978
01:04:23,057 --> 01:04:24,688
It just doesn't seem like you.

979
01:04:25,979 --> 01:04:27,723
Well... That was me.

980
01:04:28,272 --> 01:04:30,822
It's all the same, Pumas, onions.

981
01:04:33,098 --> 01:04:35,176
Ah... I feel a lot better now.

982
01:04:35,224 --> 01:04:36,084
Thank you.

983
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:39,124
Wait a minute! Wait! Your poor mom.

984
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:40,431
I didn't mean to encourage you.

985
01:04:40,594 --> 01:04:41,726
Take my advice.

986
01:04:41,728 --> 01:04:44,353
Your mom a smart woman. Listen to her.

987
01:04:45,837 --> 01:04:46,783
It's OK.

988
01:04:49,068 --> 01:04:51,406
I'm giving up the Puma anyhow.

989
01:04:52,042 --> 01:04:52,882
Good girl.

990
01:04:53,736 --> 01:04:57,640
Hey, this deserves a bit of ice cream.

991
01:04:57,949 --> 01:04:58,994
Sound good!

992
01:05:17,835 --> 01:05:18,846
Aah.

993
01:05:19,956 --> 01:05:20,493
Huh?

994
01:05:21,597 --> 01:05:22,251
Hey!

995
01:05:24,243 --> 01:05:24,853
Hi.

996
01:05:24,868 --> 01:05:26,203
Not so fast.

997
01:05:27,077 --> 01:05:29,298
They're 100 yen each.

998
01:05:32,907 --> 01:05:32,916
Hey MM77020, are you up for a drive?

999
01:05:32,956 --> 01:05:35,056
Hey Taeko, are you up for a drive?

1000
01:05:35,311 --> 01:05:38,110
I'd like to take you to Zaō tomorrow. Its pretty.

1001
01:05:38,938 --> 01:05:39,696
Zaō?

1002
01:05:39,868 --> 01:05:40,556
Mmm.

1003
01:05:41,516 --> 01:05:43,782
They said you went to a temple
there last time you were here.

1004
01:05:44,697 --> 01:05:47,208
The elders gave me permission. Don't worry.

1005
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:14,794
The views at mount Zaō was incredible.

1006
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,082
Beautiful.

1007
01:06:16,641 --> 01:06:19,293
But Zaō itself has got a little bit touristy.

1008
01:06:24,722 --> 01:06:26,809
Why haven't you ever gotten married?

1009
01:06:27,262 --> 01:06:27,747
Huh?

1010
01:06:28,674 --> 01:06:30,840
Why, is it that strange that I'm single?

1011
01:06:31,538 --> 01:06:32,324
Ah...

1012
01:06:32,606 --> 01:06:34,036
No, I didn't mean that.

1013
01:06:34,425 --> 01:06:36,793
There are plenty on women in the city who work.

1014
01:06:37,217 --> 01:06:40,153
And I think my single friends
outnumber the ones that are married.

1015
01:06:40,984 --> 01:06:42,403
Oh, really?

1016
01:06:43,063 --> 01:06:43,692
For sure.

1017
01:06:44,508 --> 01:06:45,364
It makes sense.

1018
01:06:46,087 --> 01:06:46,975
It's true.

1019
01:06:48,169 --> 01:06:48,879
Okay.

1020
01:06:49,454 --> 01:06:51,278
It is completely normal.

1021
01:06:57,892 --> 01:06:59,512
So, Toshio...

1022
01:06:59,693 --> 01:07:03,536
When you were small how were you with fractions?

1023
01:07:04,053 --> 01:07:04,629
Huh?

1024
01:07:05,623 --> 01:07:08,551
Where you flip the numerator and denominator,

1025
01:07:08,629 --> 01:07:09,832
did you get that?

1026
01:07:10,165 --> 01:07:12,464
Uh... I don't remember.

1027
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:15,801
But I don't think I found it very difficult. You?

1028
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:17,067
Even fractions?

1029
01:07:17,082 --> 01:07:17,562
Mmm.

1030
01:07:18,168 --> 01:07:19,020
Lucky you.

1031
01:07:19,193 --> 01:07:22,051
I bet you don't remember because
you understood it right away.

1032
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:23,458
Yeah...

1033
01:07:23,627 --> 01:07:25,441
But why do you ask all of a sudden?

1034
01:07:26,293 --> 01:07:29,786
I believe that people who understand
how to divide fractions right away,

1035
01:07:29,823 --> 01:07:31,489
understand life right away too.

1036
01:07:33,288 --> 01:07:35,687
OK, here then, let me give you an example.

1037
01:07:36,176 --> 01:07:38,415
One of my friends was just average in school,

1038
01:07:38,661 --> 01:07:41,835
but she could flip a numerator like that.

1039
01:07:42,334 --> 01:07:45,434
I think people who understood that saw life more clearly.

1040
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:47,176
She always new she would get married

1041
01:07:47,228 --> 01:07:48,567
and exactly what she'd do.

1042
01:07:49,164 --> 01:07:49,739
Hum...

1043
01:07:50,979 --> 01:07:53,450
But I was terrible at fractions.

1044
01:07:54,235 --> 01:07:57,106
Sometimes I'd just wish that it had been easier for me.

1045
01:08:14,036 --> 01:08:16,356
Uh... You see...

1046
01:08:17,327 --> 01:08:18,889
Before the test...

1047
01:08:18,905 --> 01:08:19,690
Uh...

1048
01:08:20,994 --> 01:08:22,514
We had art class.

1049
01:08:24,061 --> 01:08:25,259
And... we did...

1050
01:08:25,694 --> 01:08:28,045
Uh... we did blow pictures.

1051
01:08:28,231 --> 01:08:29,381
Blow what?

1052
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:34,202
Well... You spread the paint on the paper and...

1053
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,702
You blow on it to make patterns.

1054
01:08:40,019 --> 01:08:41,241
Oh, I see.

1055
01:08:41,781 --> 01:08:42,350
Then...

1056
01:08:43,776 --> 01:08:44,869
Really hard see.

1057
01:08:45,676 --> 01:08:46,319
See?

1058
01:08:47,302 --> 01:08:48,147
And then?

1059
01:08:48,673 --> 01:08:51,405
My head ached. From doing it all day.

1060
01:08:53,173 --> 01:08:54,499
And blowing so hard.

1061
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:56,835
And that's why you did so poorly?

1062
01:08:57,487 --> 01:08:59,491
Huh, I guess so.

1063
01:09:00,953 --> 01:09:02,311
Very well then.

1064
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:10,593
Do you know the right answers to the ones you got wrong?

1065
01:09:10,866 --> 01:09:11,581
Huh?

1066
01:09:11,761 --> 01:09:13,292
The correct answers?

1067
01:09:13,564 --> 01:09:14,269
Uh...

1068
01:09:14,894 --> 01:09:15,921
Hmm.

1069
01:09:16,839 --> 01:09:18,618
Get Yaeko to help you with it.

1070
01:09:19,305 --> 01:09:20,561
Really! Yaeko?!

1071
01:09:21,092 --> 01:09:22,305
Or Nanako.

1072
01:09:23,516 --> 01:09:25,188
If you think that would be better for you.

1073
01:09:28,501 --> 01:09:29,745
I'll ask Nanako.

1074
01:09:51,356 --> 01:09:55,771
Nanako's not back yet. Can I
wait 'til later for her to help me?

1075
01:10:05,387 --> 01:10:07,764
Guess I'll just have to ask Yaeko.

1076
01:10:24,895 --> 01:10:26,309
You can't be serious!

1077
01:10:26,638 --> 01:10:28,794
Mother! Mother!

1078
01:10:31,369 --> 01:10:32,817
What on earth is this?!

1079
01:10:33,676 --> 01:10:35,187
How am I suppose to help her?

1080
01:10:35,208 --> 01:10:38,546
Just do your best. I'm sure you can be patient with her.

1081
01:10:40,801 --> 01:10:42,715
She doesn't understand at all.

1082
01:10:42,731 --> 01:10:44,317
How can I help someone like that?

1083
01:10:44,364 --> 01:10:45,957
I'm sure you can find a way.

1084
01:10:45,973 --> 01:10:47,996
But something is definitely wrong with her

1085
01:10:48,012 --> 01:10:49,407
I said help her!

1086
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:53,394
Mother... No normal kid could get a mark this low.

1087
01:10:53,517 --> 01:10:55,731
But Taeko is not a normal kid!

1088
01:11:09,859 --> 01:11:12,640
Taeko, your sister's going to help you.

1089
01:11:15,687 --> 01:11:17,918
You got a headache from blowing patterns.

1090
01:11:18,602 --> 01:11:19,882
I understand.

1091
01:11:20,798 --> 01:11:21,572
Taeko.

1092
01:11:23,407 --> 01:11:24,237
Sit down.

1093
01:11:29,401 --> 01:11:31,454
Now, recite your times tables out loud.

1094
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,463
I don't need to prove that to you.

1095
01:11:33,479 --> 01:11:35,065
Just tell me what to do.

1096
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:37,955
I'm telling you! You need to know your multiplication!

1097
01:11:38,432 --> 01:11:40,714
It's division by fractions.

1098
01:11:41,276 --> 01:11:41,845
Hmm.

1099
01:11:47,461 --> 01:11:52,351
All you have to do is reverse the
numerator and denominator then multiply.

1100
01:11:52,816 --> 01:11:54,313
Didn't they tell you that at school?

1101
01:11:55,648 --> 01:11:56,492
Uh-huh.

1102
01:11:56,617 --> 01:11:58,214
Then why is it all wrong?

1103
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:01,406
Yaeko, be patient please.

1104
01:12:06,433 --> 01:12:09,173
Why would you divide a fraction by a fraction?

1105
01:12:15,337 --> 01:12:18,867
Dividing two-thirds of an apple into quarter means...

1106
01:12:18,883 --> 01:12:24,200
If you take two-thirds of an
apple and split it into four ways...

1107
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,185
How much apple does each person get?

1108
01:12:27,473 --> 01:12:27,786
Uh'?

1109
01:12:29,231 --> 01:12:29,904
Hum...?

1110
01:12:30,567 --> 01:12:35,969
And so, it's one, two, three, four, five, six...

1111
01:12:36,377 --> 01:12:38,978
One-sixth of an apple each.

1112
01:12:39,999 --> 01:12:43,209
Stop, stop, stop, stop. That's multiplying.

1113
01:12:43,313 --> 01:12:44,984
What? No way!

1114
01:12:45,216 --> 01:12:47,066
When you multiply it's more?

1115
01:12:47,131 --> 01:12:50,883
If you divided two-thirds of an apple by a quarter...

1116
01:12:55,097 --> 01:12:56,264
Anyhoo!

1117
01:12:57,824 --> 01:12:59,771
Stop thinking of the apples,

1118
01:13:00,271 --> 01:13:01,333
all you have to remember

1119
01:13:01,786 --> 01:13:02,989
to multiply you leave it the same.

1120
01:13:03,122 --> 01:13:04,231
To divide you reverse it.

1121
01:13:13,132 --> 01:13:15,171
Is that actress in Takarazuka?

1122
01:13:15,352 --> 01:13:16,382
S.K.D.

1123
01:13:17,547 --> 01:13:19,398
A "D" in her math exam.

1124
01:13:20,421 --> 01:13:21,009
A "D"?

1125
01:13:21,372 --> 01:13:23,812
That's right and it's better than last time.

1126
01:13:26,447 --> 01:13:30,210
If she got a "B" or a "C" I could tell her to work harder.

1127
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,468
Yeah you could.

1128
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:35,452
Should you maybe get her IQ tested?

1129
01:13:35,815 --> 01:13:38,765
When she first started school she did pretty well.

1130
01:13:38,844 --> 01:13:40,198
She's getting dumber.

1131
01:13:40,413 --> 01:13:43,265
She did fall down the stairs when she was a baby.

1132
01:13:43,530 --> 01:13:45,812
That's right, in her baby walker.

1133
01:13:46,326 --> 01:13:48,335
I really thought she was dead for sure.

1134
01:13:48,897 --> 01:13:50,671
All she got was a bump on the head.

1135
01:13:50,687 --> 01:13:52,076
And now it's affecting her.

1136
01:13:52,092 --> 01:13:54,060
Your right. That must be it!

1137
01:13:54,265 --> 01:13:57,894
I don't think that's it. She's just not very good at math.

1138
01:13:57,896 --> 01:13:59,882
I bet shes talking all the time in class.

1139
01:13:59,998 --> 01:14:02,858
If she'd just listen, divisional fractions would be easy.

1140
01:14:03,187 --> 01:14:04,780
Any idiot can do it.

1141
01:14:04,818 --> 01:14:07,827
And what about next year, shes going into sixth grade.

1142
01:14:07,902 --> 01:14:09,456
I never see her studying at home.

1143
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:10,385
That's true.

1144
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,093
I don't get it.

1145
01:14:12,292 --> 01:14:16,369
Dividing two-thirds of an apple, by one-forth of an apple.

1146
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:19,749
I haven't the slightest idea what that could possibly be.

1147
01:14:20,199 --> 01:14:21,687
I'll show them.

1148
01:14:22,257 --> 01:14:24,363
Divided two-thirds of an apple

1149
01:14:24,379 --> 01:14:25,919
by a quarter means...

1150
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:29,512
Ahh! I don't get it!

1151
01:14:32,428 --> 01:14:34,117
I never came to grips with it.

1152
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:36,061
Have you ever felt that way about anything?

1153
01:14:36,443 --> 01:14:37,579
Even a fraction?

1154
01:14:38,903 --> 01:14:39,757
Hum...

1155
01:14:43,403 --> 01:14:44,116
You know what?

1156
01:14:44,944 --> 01:14:47,799
We have to work even harder on organic farming.

1157
01:14:48,007 --> 01:14:50,815
We've let the rich and powerful
take control of us farmers.

1158
01:14:50,831 --> 01:14:52,796
We've tried to be like people from the city.

1159
01:14:53,358 --> 01:14:54,965
But lost ourselves along the way.

1160
01:14:54,981 --> 01:14:58,619
So, we have to think, about
getting back to real aquaculture.

1161
01:14:58,635 --> 01:14:59,530
As it was.

1162
01:15:01,561 --> 01:15:02,577
Goodness me...

1163
01:15:05,203 --> 01:15:07,522
Farming, it's really a passion.

1164
01:15:08,478 --> 01:15:08,874
Mm.

1165
01:15:12,134 --> 01:15:14,343
You know... That's my friends speech.

1166
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:18,085
Yup', but I feel the same way.

1167
01:15:18,887 --> 01:15:23,594
I think it's great... the... all the thought you put
into division of fractions is still so important to you.

1168
01:15:23,736 --> 01:15:26,218
Well, I didn't mean it to sound like a big deal.

1169
01:15:28,283 --> 01:15:32,163
People are always telling me, that
I got a good job, at a good company

1170
01:15:32,874 --> 01:15:35,311
but its not something that I'm really into.

1171
01:15:35,835 --> 01:15:37,965
You clearly love farming.

1172
01:15:38,356 --> 01:15:41,819
Its difficult not to admire your conviction.

1173
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,358
Are you.. Kidding?

1174
01:15:47,867 --> 01:15:48,984
Of course not!

1175
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:52,023
Your lucky you know what you want from life.

1176
01:15:58,179 --> 01:16:00,131
Agra culture is a declining industry.

1177
01:16:00,498 --> 01:16:03,539
It'll be nice if we're in a situation
where we could just work through it

1178
01:16:03,948 --> 01:16:06,046
and not have to think about it but... We're not.

1179
01:16:06,134 --> 01:16:08,375
So... we've got a lot to think about.

1180
01:16:08,914 --> 01:16:11,327
We've got to learn from each other. Back each other up.

1181
01:16:11,343 --> 01:16:12,914
If we don't, we'll never make it.

1182
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:21,296
Taeko do you ski?

1183
01:16:21,563 --> 01:16:22,269
Yeah.

1184
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:25,353
I've been a couple times with
some friends but I'm not very good.

1185
01:16:25,369 --> 01:16:25,836
Great.

1186
01:16:26,184 --> 01:16:27,319
Hey, you know what...

1187
01:16:27,344 --> 01:16:29,328
Why don't you come back and ski this winter?

1188
01:16:29,838 --> 01:16:32,320
Wait. You're really good at it aren't you?

1189
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:36,855
I.. I'm all right. I'm an
instructor here at Zaō in the winter.

1190
01:16:36,933 --> 01:16:40,354
An instructor? You must be great.

1191
01:16:40,999 --> 01:16:43,414
Naw, every one around here is an instructor.

1192
01:17:05,561 --> 01:17:07,561
Now this is countryside.

1193
01:17:08,076 --> 01:17:09,623
The real countryside.

1194
01:17:10,169 --> 01:17:11,154
Not like Zao.

1195
01:17:13,108 --> 01:17:15,115
Um... Not really.

1196
01:17:15,225 --> 01:17:17,975
Oh, Zaō was beautiful but...

1197
01:17:18,074 --> 01:17:20,967
Don't worry. It's interesting you say that.

1198
01:17:21,467 --> 01:17:22,038
Oh?

1199
01:17:22,318 --> 01:17:22,787
Mmm.

1200
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:27,248
City people see forest and woods
and streams and they're happy.

1201
01:17:27,422 --> 01:17:29,686
Because they think what they see is "nature".

1202
01:17:30,787 --> 01:17:32,743
Apart from back deep in the mountains

1203
01:17:33,084 --> 01:17:36,092
almost every thing you see here is the work of a farmer.

1204
01:17:36,764 --> 01:17:37,600
That so?

1205
01:17:38,027 --> 01:17:39,506
Sure, of course it is.

1206
01:17:44,303 --> 01:17:45,217
The river?

1207
01:17:45,271 --> 01:17:46,006
A dam.

1208
01:17:46,479 --> 01:17:47,514
And those woods?

1209
01:17:47,645 --> 01:17:48,365
Planted.

1210
01:17:49,143 --> 01:17:50,154
And this stream?

1211
01:17:50,193 --> 01:17:50,678
Dug.

1212
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:55,365
Irrigation, it's not just the paddies and the fields.

1213
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:57,701
Everything has been touched by man.

1214
01:17:58,326 --> 01:18:01,397
Our ancestors cleared this and cultivated that

1215
01:18:01,811 --> 01:18:05,056
encouraged mushrooms, Berry's, wild garlic.

1216
01:18:05,072 --> 01:18:05,709
Really?

1217
01:18:05,935 --> 01:18:09,490
Yeah. The scenery come about by lucky accident.

1218
01:18:09,989 --> 01:18:14,193
As people have struggled with nature
to get what they needed to survive.

1219
01:18:14,858 --> 01:18:19,029
So without people, this scenery wouldn't have been here.

1220
01:18:19,771 --> 01:18:21,256
No it wouldn't have.

1221
01:18:22,108 --> 01:18:23,797
To get what they need from nature,

1222
01:18:24,115 --> 01:18:29,717
farmers have to do a lot of different things to
make sure that nature will continue to provide forever.

1223
01:18:34,139 --> 01:18:37,701
It's sort a joint venture between people and the earth.

1224
01:18:39,341 --> 01:18:41,272
That's how the country side works.

1225
01:18:42,564 --> 01:18:43,912
Now I get it.

1226
01:18:44,676 --> 01:18:46,342
All these feelings I have.

1227
01:18:47,538 --> 01:18:49,546
Almost nostalgic for this place.

1228
01:18:50,022 --> 01:18:52,639
There's a connection even though it's not where I grew up.

1229
01:18:53,149 --> 01:18:54,671
Does that make any sense?

1230
01:18:57,615 --> 01:18:59,374
So, that's what it is.

1231
01:19:49,071 --> 01:19:50,855
Oh my poor back.

1232
01:19:52,197 --> 01:19:55,699
I'm not sure what's so cool about organic farming?

1233
01:19:57,933 --> 01:20:00,744
I told you... It's very cool in theory but...

1234
01:20:01,311 --> 01:20:03,939
The difficult part is putting it all into practice.

1235
01:20:03,968 --> 01:20:05,883
Helping everything grow naturally.

1236
01:20:06,052 --> 01:20:09,369
Tell me again why we're farming
like it's a hundred years ago.

1237
01:20:09,606 --> 01:20:13,775
These days, with most of your organic
rice they'll spray it once with weed-killer.

1238
01:20:14,139 --> 01:20:16,590
Most places don't weed by hand like they used to.

1239
01:20:17,669 --> 01:20:19,267
There just isn't the manpower to do it.

1240
01:20:21,616 --> 01:20:23,205
You're really working hard aren't cha'?

1241
01:20:23,321 --> 01:20:24,400
Ya' ready for a break?

1242
01:20:25,533 --> 01:20:26,603
How about some tea?

1243
01:20:26,934 --> 01:20:28,838
Yes! I'd love some.

1244
01:20:29,778 --> 01:20:32,484
Anything to take a break from organic farming.

1245
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:44,236
Thanks to Toshio, I got to
try a whole bunch of new things.

1246
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:48,158
I was proud to learn about a
world I'd always felt close to

1247
01:20:48,681 --> 01:20:50,210
but never truly knew.

1248
01:21:19,828 --> 01:21:20,469
Wow.

1249
01:21:39,995 --> 01:21:42,832
"Oh, the crows are flying away."

1250
01:21:43,594 --> 01:21:44,238
"Look!"

1251
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:50,076
I finely got to see that for real.

1252
01:21:54,246 --> 01:21:56,519
That was my most famous line ever.

1253
01:21:57,098 --> 01:21:59,574
I had just one line in my school play.

1254
01:22:00,879 --> 01:22:01,550
Really?

1255
01:22:03,121 --> 01:22:04,388
Yeah, me too.

1256
01:22:04,605 --> 01:22:06,269
I only got small parts to play.

1257
01:22:06,501 --> 01:22:07,394
How 'bout you?

1258
01:22:08,170 --> 01:22:10,686
Hmm... I always get the big parts.

1259
01:22:11,064 --> 01:22:13,311
Cause there aren't very many kids in my class.

1260
01:22:13,673 --> 01:22:14,467
That's great..

1261
01:22:15,365 --> 01:22:16,498
But on the other hand,

1262
01:22:16,679 --> 01:22:18,299
it's a bit of a problem here.

1263
01:22:18,315 --> 01:22:22,898
You can't imagine how modern farming
has forced family's to the city for work.

1264
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:24,373
So, not many kids around, huh?

1265
01:22:24,388 --> 01:22:25,177
Yeah.

1266
01:22:25,369 --> 01:22:27,654
Hey, at least it makes drama more fun.

1267
01:22:28,141 --> 01:22:30,771
Mmm, nuh-uh, I'm more into sports.

1268
01:22:31,107 --> 01:22:32,021
I like track and field.

1269
01:22:32,056 --> 01:22:33,189
I'm a pretty good runner.

1270
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:37,197
Are you? I was never more than average.

1271
01:22:37,670 --> 01:22:40,623
And no more than "Village Child 1:" On the school play.

1272
01:22:40,887 --> 01:22:44,826
But you know what? I'll never ever forget that one line.

1273
01:22:45,311 --> 01:22:49,694
It's crazy... I honestly thought
I was going to become a star.

1274
01:22:50,092 --> 01:22:50,951
A star?

1275
01:22:51,207 --> 01:22:51,701
Yup'.

1276
01:22:52,519 --> 01:22:53,191
Really?

1277
01:22:53,559 --> 01:22:55,060
As "Village Child 1?"

1278
01:22:55,305 --> 01:22:55,886
Sure.

1279
01:22:56,965 --> 01:22:59,159
Like... You were going to move to Holly wood?

1280
01:22:59,381 --> 01:23:00,152
I know.

1281
01:23:01,089 --> 01:23:02,917
I really threw my self into the part.

1282
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:06,072
I bet you were adorable back then.

1283
01:23:06,583 --> 01:23:08,089
No, it's not that!

1284
01:23:08,941 --> 01:23:11,908
I would practice in front of
the mirror for hours and hours.

1285
01:23:12,425 --> 01:23:13,386
You did what?

1286
01:23:14,050 --> 01:23:15,253
For "Village Child 1"...

1287
01:23:15,269 --> 01:23:16,605
I practiced.

1288
01:23:16,848 --> 01:23:18,859
You see I only had one line

1289
01:23:19,055 --> 01:23:20,792
and I couldn't do very much with it.

1290
01:23:21,269 --> 01:23:25,005
"Aw, the crows are flying away... look."

1291
01:23:25,277 --> 01:23:26,097
Tricky huh?

1292
01:23:26,595 --> 01:23:29,096
And then, I bet, you invented new lines.

1293
01:23:29,487 --> 01:23:30,558
Of course.

1294
01:23:32,338 --> 01:23:37,800
Aw... Look up there, all the crows are flying away today.

1295
01:23:39,003 --> 01:23:40,762
Watch them fly away.

1296
01:23:41,006 --> 01:23:41,906
There's two.

1297
01:23:41,908 --> 01:23:42,816
There's three...

1298
01:23:42,892 --> 01:23:43,923
There's four...

1299
01:23:45,562 --> 01:23:49,097
See you later. Goodbye crows.

1300
01:23:51,042 --> 01:23:52,300
Bye.

1301
01:23:52,752 --> 01:23:54,066
And the teacher loved it.

1302
01:23:54,265 --> 01:23:55,589
Not one bit.

1303
01:23:56,192 --> 01:23:58,355
Fine that was very nice.

1304
01:23:59,004 --> 01:24:03,341
But please, lets only say the
lines that are written on the script.

1305
01:24:07,297 --> 01:24:10,816
We are the magicians of the village.

1306
01:24:11,033 --> 01:24:14,506
We will put a spell on you.

1307
01:24:15,503 --> 01:24:18,086
That's sad, what's wrong with a few extra words.

1308
01:24:18,102 --> 01:24:20,836
They weren't very good anyways
so I didn't mind giving them up.

1309
01:24:21,014 --> 01:24:23,735
But I still had the desire to express myself.

1310
01:24:24,094 --> 01:24:26,574
I realized what I couldn't do with words

1311
01:24:26,716 --> 01:24:29,125
I could express in the way I moved.

1312
01:24:32,514 --> 01:24:34,074
Aah...

1313
01:24:35,923 --> 01:24:39,168
Oh look, the crows are flying away.

1314
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:45,285
There.

1315
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:46,308
There's two.

1316
01:24:46,516 --> 01:24:47,621
There's three.

1317
01:24:47,636 --> 01:24:48,726
There's four.

1318
01:25:02,863 --> 01:25:04,187
Bye.

1319
01:25:10,449 --> 01:25:11,636
That all it was.

1320
01:25:13,292 --> 01:25:14,714
But it was worth the effort.

1321
01:25:15,144 --> 01:25:17,339
"Village Child 1" was a big hit.

1322
01:25:18,073 --> 01:25:19,362
It's hard to believe, right?

1323
01:25:20,463 --> 01:25:23,697
All the teachers said I was
truly fantastic n' stole the show.

1324
01:25:23,862 --> 01:25:26,338
And I was asked to join a local theater company.

1325
01:25:27,385 --> 01:25:30,322
Then one day, it got even better than that.

1326
01:25:34,149 --> 01:25:35,385
Hello, excuse me?

1327
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:35,744
Oh!

1328
01:25:35,846 --> 01:25:36,588
Coming.

1329
01:25:36,777 --> 01:25:39,814
Then suddenly several dozen sticks of dynamite went off.

1330
01:25:39,971 --> 01:25:41,541
Boom! Right in front of me.

1331
01:25:41,675 --> 01:25:43,624
In front of you.

1332
01:25:44,322 --> 01:25:45,755
Really, Taeko?

1333
01:25:45,771 --> 01:25:47,521
...with granny and captain kid.

1334
01:25:47,523 --> 01:25:50,642
And all the potatoes turned out to be dynamite.

1335
01:25:50,658 --> 01:25:53,158
Our physical play has a child roll.

1336
01:25:57,595 --> 01:26:02,468
We'd very much like your daughter Taeko, to
perform in the university theater production.

1337
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:03,676
We think she'd be fantastic.

1338
01:26:03,678 --> 01:26:04,730
Perform!

1339
01:26:04,791 --> 01:26:05,541
I see.

1340
01:26:06,057 --> 01:26:08,873
We'd have rehearsal on Saturday afternoons.

1341
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:11,509
And I promise they wouldn't go too late.

1342
01:26:11,822 --> 01:26:13,830
Alright, but...

1343
01:26:14,899 --> 01:26:18,143
Oh and we'll make sure she gets home okay.

1344
01:26:18,652 --> 01:26:20,499
Me in a grown-up play?

1345
01:26:20,697 --> 01:26:22,869
Not with those amateur kids.

1346
01:26:22,977 --> 01:26:25,314
I'll be with real grown-ups!

1347
01:26:25,377 --> 01:26:27,154
I'll be a star!

1348
01:26:28,372 --> 01:26:35,878
Oh, oh, oh, oh what a wonderful day.

1349
01:26:36,109 --> 01:26:37,797
Cock-a Cock-a Cock-a Cock-a.

1350
01:26:37,944 --> 01:26:39,061
Cock-a.

1351
01:26:39,098 --> 01:26:41,259
Cock-a Cock-a Cock-a Cock-a.

1352
01:26:41,261 --> 01:26:42,244
'Gack'-a.

1353
01:26:42,556 --> 01:26:44,536
Cock-a Cock-a Cock-a Cock-a.

1354
01:26:44,538 --> 01:26:45,747
'Gack'-a.

1355
01:26:45,774 --> 01:26:47,773
Cock-a Cock-a Cock-a Cock-a.

1356
01:26:47,775 --> 01:26:49,481
'Gack'-a.

1357
01:26:54,403 --> 01:26:55,886
Oh! Mom!

1358
01:26:58,045 --> 01:26:58,983
Who was that?

1359
01:26:59,307 --> 01:27:03,337
A young man from Nihon University
wants you to be in his production.

1360
01:27:03,499 --> 01:27:06,827
Taeko, I guess you did really well in the school play.

1361
01:27:07,287 --> 01:27:08,704
And? So?

1362
01:27:09,225 --> 01:27:13,929
He said that he'd hoped you do
it and he ask me very respectfully.

1363
01:27:21,093 --> 01:27:22,918
Hey, that's great!

1364
01:27:23,304 --> 01:27:25,347
So, you finally you found something your good at.

1365
01:27:25,479 --> 01:27:28,401
No, no Taeko wrights some very good essays.

1366
01:27:28,426 --> 01:27:31,081
Sounds like she's perfectly suited for this.

1367
01:27:31,203 --> 01:27:32,979
Much better than studying math.

1368
01:27:33,856 --> 01:27:35,284
Oh yeah. For sure.

1369
01:27:35,539 --> 01:27:38,402
You know, I played the lead part "Tongue-Cut Sparrow"

1370
01:27:38,418 --> 01:27:40,589
but nobody ask me to be in their play.

1371
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:42,684
I know, I know!

1372
01:27:43,313 --> 01:27:45,221
So... What's next?

1373
01:28:08,839 --> 01:28:11,803
This is show business. You could become a child star.

1374
01:28:11,819 --> 01:28:12,519
Huh?

1375
01:28:13,012 --> 01:28:14,855
You should join the Takarazuka.

1376
01:28:15,132 --> 01:28:18,088
Yes! If you practice, maybe you could join them.

1377
01:28:19,924 --> 01:28:21,398
We'll have no performing.

1378
01:28:21,414 --> 01:28:22,010
Huh?

1379
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,498
No show business.

1380
01:28:26,410 --> 01:28:29,356
Dad... its university play, not real show biz.

1381
01:28:29,372 --> 01:28:31,212
That's right. It's just...

1382
01:28:32,082 --> 01:28:32,868
I said no.

1383
01:28:34,305 --> 01:28:34,962
My dinner.

1384
01:28:35,947 --> 01:28:36,587
Yes.

1385
01:28:55,268 --> 01:28:57,637
Dad can get really stubborn, can't he.

1386
01:28:57,896 --> 01:29:01,649
This is your fault. Your the one
that said I could become a child star.

1387
01:29:01,958 --> 01:29:03,508
Can I get in the bath first?

1388
01:29:03,816 --> 01:29:04,614
Sure you can.

1389
01:29:06,277 --> 01:29:07,911
And Takarazuka.

1390
01:29:08,851 --> 01:29:10,965
All that stuff about show business.

1391
01:29:12,031 --> 01:29:13,903
Why'd you have to tell him that, huh?

1392
01:29:14,189 --> 01:29:15,340
Why Nanako?

1393
01:29:16,973 --> 01:29:18,145
Your such a pest.

1394
01:29:23,219 --> 01:29:32,853
Poor boy, poor boy, don't you feel sorry for me?

1395
01:29:33,313 --> 01:29:35,774
I promise, we won't take much of her time.

1396
01:29:36,316 --> 01:29:38,415
Yes, but I-I-I...

1397
01:29:39,626 --> 01:29:41,415
We'd very much appreciate it.

1398
01:29:42,118 --> 01:29:44,079
She's really very shy...

1399
01:29:44,381 --> 01:29:45,391
Very timid.

1400
01:29:52,707 --> 01:29:55,625
I realise you had to come all the way here again

1401
01:29:55,733 --> 01:29:57,442
I'm really very sorry.

1402
01:29:57,755 --> 01:30:02,675
Poor boy, poor boy...

1403
01:30:02,927 --> 01:30:07,347
Such a long way from home...

1404
01:30:08,224 --> 01:30:18,264
Poor boy.

1405
01:30:22,647 --> 01:30:26,637
And now Aoki from class 5-1 is going to act in that play.

1406
01:30:30,455 --> 01:30:33,152
She's been going around telling everyone.

1407
01:30:33,824 --> 01:30:34,613
Oh?

1408
01:30:34,799 --> 01:30:36,831
Today, her mother even came to the school

1409
01:30:36,873 --> 01:30:41,506
and Aoki got to change into her
best clothes to go to Nihon University.

1410
01:30:41,565 --> 01:30:45,446
Her dress had enormous frills that go all the way out.

1411
01:30:45,609 --> 01:30:46,449
Taeko.

1412
01:30:46,542 --> 01:30:46,996
Huh?

1413
01:30:47,807 --> 01:30:53,198
You can't tell anyone that the young man from
Nihon University came and asked for you first.

1414
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:59,808
How do you think the other girl would feel
knowing that she wasn't their first choice.

1415
01:31:04,469 --> 01:31:05,511
Understood?

1416
01:31:09,019 --> 01:31:09,928
Well Taeko?

1417
01:31:11,595 --> 01:31:12,385
Hmm.

1418
01:31:28,490 --> 01:31:30,045
That was news for children.

1419
01:31:30,047 --> 01:31:33,693
And now its time for pop-up pumpkin island.

1420
01:31:40,456 --> 01:31:43,771
Breaking through the waves.

1421
01:31:45,616 --> 01:31:48,702
Shooting through the clouds.

1422
01:31:50,613 --> 01:32:00,369
Where is it heading? Yokkori
Pumpkin island? Where will it take us?

1423
01:32:01,416 --> 01:32:06,773
Something special waits for us,

1424
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:11,507
Just over the horizon.

1425
01:32:11,894 --> 01:32:17,023
There'll be hard times, there'll be sad times,

1426
01:32:17,232 --> 01:32:19,579
but we'll never lose heart.

1427
01:32:19,735 --> 01:32:21,944
We hate to cry, so let's laugh instead.

1428
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:25,079
Let's go!

1429
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:27,550
Hyokkori Pumpkin island!

1430
01:32:27,860 --> 01:32:30,284
Hyokkori Pumpkin island!

1431
01:32:30,559 --> 01:32:36,289
Hyokkori Pumpkin island!

1432
01:32:48,287 --> 01:32:50,699
So sad. Poor little Taeko.

1433
01:32:53,224 --> 01:32:56,586
I guess I never really managed
to put all all that behind me.

1434
01:32:57,403 --> 01:33:01,156
So, as soon as I got to high school,
I immediately joined the drama club.

1435
01:33:02,216 --> 01:33:02,859
And then what?

1436
01:33:03,695 --> 01:33:06,706
Turns out "Village Child 1" was a bit of a "one-off".

1437
01:33:06,731 --> 01:33:07,317
Really?

1438
01:33:08,449 --> 01:33:09,968
I wasn't gonna be a star.

1439
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:12,994
But I had a lot of fun and well ah...

1440
01:33:13,514 --> 01:33:14,736
Ah to much. It was just a dream.

1441
01:33:15,633 --> 01:33:16,602
Yeah, but...

1442
01:33:18,965 --> 01:33:23,051
Your old man, your old man. Whether
it's in Tokyo or out here in the country.

1443
01:33:24,822 --> 01:33:29,215
You know, when I was in high school,
all I wanted to do was to go to Tokyo.

1444
01:33:33,028 --> 01:33:35,645
I wanted to apply to a couples of colleges there but...

1445
01:33:35,945 --> 01:33:37,100
It didn't come to anything.

1446
01:33:38,631 --> 01:33:39,981
Must have been frustrating.

1447
01:33:41,653 --> 01:33:42,583
I accepted it

1448
01:33:42,992 --> 01:33:45,036
but some of those guys who went to Tokyo

1449
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:48,479
they were no smarter when they
came back than when they went away.

1450
01:33:50,262 --> 01:33:51,354
Doesn't bother me now.

1451
01:33:51,606 --> 01:33:53,685
My father always knew I would make a good farmer.

1452
01:33:54,054 --> 01:33:55,606
The old mans pretty wise.

1453
01:33:58,485 --> 01:34:00,567
I think I know how you must have felt.

1454
01:34:01,278 --> 01:34:04,317
Oh! But I was never really going
to be an actor, don't you see.

1455
01:34:04,319 --> 01:34:06,388
Course I do. But it's the same thing.

1456
01:34:09,345 --> 01:34:11,864
"I am happy as my face shows."

1457
01:34:12,107 --> 01:34:14,837
"My face shows that I don't care."

1458
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:18,063
I love that program as well.

1459
01:34:18,298 --> 01:34:19,118
You did?

1460
01:34:19,796 --> 01:34:21,899
Machine Gun Dandy he was great.

1461
01:34:21,966 --> 01:34:23,899
I had such a crush on him!

1462
01:34:24,870 --> 01:34:25,818
'Can believe that.

1463
01:34:26,043 --> 01:34:28,386
Hey, there were a lot of uplifting songs on that show.

1464
01:34:28,435 --> 01:34:29,561
Do you remember any of them?

1465
01:34:30,237 --> 01:34:32,579
Wait, how did that other one go? Ah!

1466
01:34:32,768 --> 01:34:35,074
"If today's is bad then tomorrow will be better."

1467
01:34:35,076 --> 01:34:37,508
"And if tomorrow is bad then try a little harder."

1468
01:34:37,674 --> 01:34:40,334
"You will see and you will know."

1469
01:34:40,484 --> 01:34:42,469
"Tomorrow tomorrow."

1470
01:34:42,690 --> 01:34:45,324
Don Don Gabacho. Don Gabacho.

1471
01:34:48,846 --> 01:34:49,924
Your crazy!

1472
01:34:50,619 --> 01:34:53,307
"If today's is bad then tomorrow will be better."

1473
01:34:53,424 --> 01:34:56,383
"And if tomorrow is bad then try a little harder."

1474
01:34:57,182 --> 01:35:00,893
The song Toshio recalled, reminds me to always look ahead.

1475
01:35:01,323 --> 01:35:02,801
That there's always tomorrow.

1476
01:35:03,264 --> 01:35:04,252
I love that.

1477
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:07,736
Of course... Tomorrow.

1478
01:35:20,456 --> 01:35:22,366
So, your leaving tomorrow.

1479
01:35:22,838 --> 01:35:23,598
Yes.

1480
01:35:24,623 --> 01:35:27,016
Thank you for all that you've done for me this summer.

1481
01:35:27,957 --> 01:35:29,594
May you stay well granny.

1482
01:35:29,904 --> 01:35:31,239
Thank you Taeko.

1483
01:35:37,919 --> 01:35:41,463
My dear, do you like this place?

1484
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:42,839
Yes, I love it.

1485
01:35:43,398 --> 01:35:45,702
I always feel very much at home here.

1486
01:35:46,041 --> 01:35:47,141
Well, I'm glad.

1487
01:35:47,904 --> 01:35:49,280
I was born here.

1488
01:35:49,881 --> 01:35:52,060
It's the only place I've ever called home.

1489
01:35:52,062 --> 01:35:53,568
I've never left.

1490
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:56,853
Well, I did go to Tokyo, on one occasion.

1491
01:35:56,997 --> 01:35:59,318
When Arimitsuo married your sister

1492
01:35:59,411 --> 01:36:01,239
I much prefer it here.

1493
01:36:01,255 --> 01:36:02,372
Do you my dear?

1494
01:36:02,644 --> 01:36:04,396
Yeah... Actually I do.

1495
01:36:05,012 --> 01:36:07,380
Tokyo is always such a tangle of traffic.

1496
01:36:07,775 --> 01:36:10,279
Even on a hot day it can be a cold place to live.

1497
01:36:10,632 --> 01:36:13,529
Out in the countryside nature connects people.

1498
01:36:14,098 --> 01:36:18,193
Taeko, could you ever see
yourself living in a place like this?

1499
01:36:18,523 --> 01:36:20,346
Sure, I suppose I could.

1500
01:36:21,013 --> 01:36:22,811
Everyone around here is so nice.

1501
01:36:26,401 --> 01:36:27,099
Taeko.

1502
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:32,402
I was thinking, why don't you become Toshio wife?

1503
01:36:33,739 --> 01:36:34,310
Huh?

1504
01:36:35,021 --> 01:36:38,224
Mitsuo left for the city when he met Nanako

1505
01:36:38,802 --> 01:36:41,255
but if you like it here you could stay.

1506
01:36:41,325 --> 01:36:42,677
No need to leave.

1507
01:36:42,740 --> 01:36:44,458
Stay and marry Toshio.

1508
01:36:44,493 --> 01:36:45,841
You'd be happy.

1509
01:36:46,508 --> 01:36:47,255
Granny!

1510
01:36:47,650 --> 01:36:50,513
Mother... Now where did that come from?

1511
01:36:51,270 --> 01:36:52,833
You'll scare the poor girl.

1512
01:36:53,554 --> 01:36:55,802
Will you consider it Taeko.

1513
01:36:57,213 --> 01:37:00,138
Don't take her seriously. You
know what a big kidder she is.

1514
01:37:00,370 --> 01:37:02,390
Mom, stop messing around.

1515
01:37:02,392 --> 01:37:04,819
I am not messing around.

1516
01:37:05,142 --> 01:37:07,727
I know that you'd like her to stay as well.

1517
01:37:08,107 --> 01:37:09,349
Er, mother...

1518
01:37:09,865 --> 01:37:11,968
It's not about what we'd like and what we'd wouldn't...

1519
01:37:11,984 --> 01:37:14,872
We'd love her to stay. Of course we would.

1520
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:19,302
But we know that girls from the
city are much more independent.

1521
01:37:19,318 --> 01:37:20,516
We can't assume that.

1522
01:37:20,802 --> 01:37:21,603
Exactly.

1523
01:37:21,927 --> 01:37:26,033
But you know, she does seem to like it here.

1524
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:28,056
And she's a good worker.

1525
01:37:28,614 --> 01:37:30,806
It does my heart good to see it.

1526
01:37:31,369 --> 01:37:34,542
I'd like nothing better that
to see her end up with Toshio.

1527
01:37:34,558 --> 01:37:36,531
Now Kiyoko... Don't you start too.

1528
01:37:36,533 --> 01:37:38,431
Your embarrassing the poor girl.

1529
01:37:39,736 --> 01:37:42,900
Taeko's got a good job with a good company in Tokyo.

1530
01:37:43,322 --> 01:37:45,052
And Toshio younger than her.

1531
01:37:45,068 --> 01:37:45,869
What?!?

1532
01:37:46,392 --> 01:37:48,767
What's that got to do with anything.

1533
01:37:50,650 --> 01:37:53,556
Taeko... Don't listen to him.

1534
01:37:54,252 --> 01:37:55,884
You could work in Yamagata.

1535
01:37:56,072 --> 01:37:58,756
Or y-you could stay here and work on the farm.

1536
01:37:58,772 --> 01:38:01,806
Kiyoko, now you shouldn't join in with this kind of talk.

1537
01:38:02,470 --> 01:38:04,728
Taeko came here for a nice vacation.

1538
01:38:05,312 --> 01:38:06,775
She's our guest here.

1539
01:38:07,719 --> 01:38:09,939
You are making her feel awkward.

1540
01:38:10,384 --> 01:38:12,221
I know you're not against it?

1541
01:38:12,332 --> 01:38:14,275
I against interfering all right.

1542
01:38:14,601 --> 01:38:16,955
I just think we need to be realistic.

1543
01:38:17,233 --> 01:38:21,420
For one thing I wonder if granny's
even bothered to speak to Toshio.

1544
01:38:21,489 --> 01:38:24,541
You can tell with one look what Toshio thinks.

1545
01:38:24,694 --> 01:38:25,712
Darn right.

1546
01:38:26,464 --> 01:38:28,920
It's not for you to say whether it could work.

1547
01:38:29,006 --> 01:38:30,433
Why don't we ask Taeko.

1548
01:38:31,354 --> 01:38:32,127
Taeko!

1549
01:38:38,401 --> 01:38:39,617
Just leave her be.

1550
01:38:40,941 --> 01:38:41,164
Tisk.

1551
01:38:42,586 --> 01:38:43,475
You see that.

1552
01:38:43,937 --> 01:38:44,703
She's gone.

1553
01:38:45,328 --> 01:38:47,101
You can't force these things.

1554
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:50,522
I was only speaking my mind and being honest.

1555
01:39:05,762 --> 01:39:09,658
Marrying a farmer, I'd never once thought of that.

1556
01:39:10,253 --> 01:39:13,792
It's a strange feeling to even
imagine that kind of life could be mine,

1557
01:39:15,769 --> 01:39:18,676
it would have been so nice just to
be able to come right out and say,

1558
01:39:18,692 --> 01:39:21,636
"Sure, if he'll have me." Like
I'd seen in a movie somewhere.

1559
01:39:22,566 --> 01:39:24,410
But I couldn't bring myself to say it.

1560
01:39:25,855 --> 01:39:29,923
Now my shallow love of the country
side, my "Lets play farm." Childs game.

1561
01:39:30,418 --> 01:39:32,416
It all left me feeling guilty.

1562
01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:37,792
I'm mortified to think of how I
prattled on about how pleasant it is here.

1563
01:39:38,251 --> 01:39:39,146
How charming.

1564
01:39:39,699 --> 01:39:40,660
How ideal.

1565
01:39:41,441 --> 01:39:43,480
I've never struggled with a harsh winter.

1566
01:39:43,949 --> 01:39:44,816
Nor a blight.

1567
01:39:45,170 --> 01:39:46,988
Nor any reality of farming.

1568
01:39:47,739 --> 01:39:49,404
I can't do this.

1569
01:39:50,391 --> 01:39:51,806
I feel so foolish.

1570
01:39:52,511 --> 01:39:54,298
Living here the earth would swallow me up.

1571
01:40:03,237 --> 01:40:04,800
I'm not shaking hands with you.

1572
01:40:08,132 --> 01:40:10,826
Hey, did you see the shirt Abe wearing today.

1573
01:40:10,842 --> 01:40:11,608
Where?

1574
01:40:11,772 --> 01:40:14,194
Its the same shirt Tanaka had in the forth grade.

1575
01:40:14,444 --> 01:40:14,874
What?

1576
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:16,030
Its a secret.

1577
01:40:16,571 --> 01:40:20,694
When it was his turn to feed the class
ducks, he kept the bread and took it home.

1578
01:40:21,046 --> 01:40:21,944
He did?

1579
01:40:22,186 --> 01:40:25,228
Have you seen the palms of his hands. They're filthy.

1580
01:40:25,772 --> 01:40:27,975
I'm sure glad I don't have to sit next to him.

1581
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:29,826
Yeah, poor Taeko.

1582
01:40:30,034 --> 01:40:32,710
Go talk to the teacher and get your seat changed.

1583
01:40:33,124 --> 01:40:35,586
Yeah, he should sit next to another boy.

1584
01:40:35,695 --> 01:40:36,647
Right Taeko?

1585
01:40:37,991 --> 01:40:38,725
Well I...

1586
01:40:39,225 --> 01:40:40,916
I'm OK with him.

1587
01:40:41,183 --> 01:40:44,038
If I moved, I think it would hurt Abe feelings..

1588
01:40:44,100 --> 01:40:45,178
I would move.

1589
01:40:45,419 --> 01:40:47,046
Little Miss Goody Two Shoes.

1590
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:50,647
Don't you dare tell him. Don't
tell him what we said to you.

1591
01:40:55,447 --> 01:40:56,709
I won't shake your hand.

1592
01:41:04,155 --> 01:41:05,114
Abe wait!

1593
01:41:18,354 --> 01:41:20,023
Taeko? What are you doing out here?

1594
01:41:20,385 --> 01:41:22,039
Oh, it's nothing.

1595
01:41:22,984 --> 01:41:24,180
I just needed some air.

1596
01:41:25,031 --> 01:41:26,305
Look at you. Your soaked.

1597
01:41:26,705 --> 01:41:29,711
Don't worry. C'mon, lets get in the car.

1598
01:41:45,249 --> 01:41:46,637
A little "going-away-gift".

1599
01:41:47,851 --> 01:41:48,989
My mother made it for you.

1600
01:41:50,947 --> 01:41:52,129
They're pickled onions.

1601
01:41:55,994 --> 01:41:58,400
Eh-no, please don't go back there.

1602
01:41:58,744 --> 01:41:59,892
Huh? Why not?

1603
01:42:00,356 --> 01:42:02,494
Please, just drive somewhere.

1604
01:42:03,860 --> 01:42:04,740
Are you okay?

1605
01:42:06,543 --> 01:42:10,599
I just saw someone. Like it was only yesterday.

1606
01:42:12,588 --> 01:42:13,365
Abe...

1607
01:42:14,735 --> 01:42:16,259
He was the new kid at school.

1608
01:42:18,396 --> 01:42:19,173
Looks the same.

1609
01:42:21,156 --> 01:42:23,084
I just saw him down the road.

1610
01:42:48,469 --> 01:42:49,974
So, this kid, Abe.

1611
01:42:50,810 --> 01:42:51,943
He was really poor.

1612
01:42:52,898 --> 01:42:54,279
He always wore the same thing.

1613
01:42:55,566 --> 01:42:56,513
He was filthy.

1614
01:42:57,138 --> 01:42:59,427
He was always snotty and always sickly.

1615
01:43:00,442 --> 01:43:02,174
He'd wipe his nose on his sleeve

1616
01:43:03,432 --> 01:43:05,448
and flick snot at us, oh!

1617
01:43:06,045 --> 01:43:08,776
And if you look at him even a little funny...

1618
01:43:10,987 --> 01:43:11,697
He'd say,

1619
01:43:11,797 --> 01:43:12,857
"What are you looking at."

1620
01:43:13,268 --> 01:43:15,848
"I'll knock those eyes out of
your head if you don't watch out."

1621
01:43:16,488 --> 01:43:17,979
I couldn't stand the little brat.

1622
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:21,816
I had to sit next to him till summer,

1623
01:43:22,314 --> 01:43:23,785
and I couldn't swap my seat.

1624
01:43:24,980 --> 01:43:26,449
We did square dancing in the gym.

1625
01:43:26,660 --> 01:43:28,816
Even then I always seemed to wind up next to him.

1626
01:43:31,050 --> 01:43:35,096
He never did his homework and I hated
how he'd ask other people to copy theirs.

1627
01:43:35,270 --> 01:43:37,253
The other girls would gossip about him.

1628
01:43:38,638 --> 01:43:42,535
Ughh... I couldn't join in. I just wouldn't do that.

1629
01:43:43,589 --> 01:43:45,000
I knew that gossiping about him,

1630
01:43:45,166 --> 01:43:47,753
especially because I hated him,
it would be the worst thing ever.

1631
01:43:50,269 --> 01:43:50,953
But then...

1632
01:43:51,489 --> 01:43:55,277
Just before the summer vacation,
Abe was leaving for another school.

1633
01:43:57,659 --> 01:44:00,488
And the teacher decided that we
should each shake his hand, goodbye.

1634
01:44:00,985 --> 01:44:02,121
Nobody wanted to.

1635
01:44:03,918 --> 01:44:05,050
It was obvious.

1636
01:44:05,643 --> 01:44:07,089
So obvious.

1637
01:44:09,922 --> 01:44:11,253
He was really nervous

1638
01:44:12,167 --> 01:44:13,557
and his hands were dirty.

1639
01:44:16,216 --> 01:44:16,753
And so...

1640
01:44:17,735 --> 01:44:19,010
He went around to each kid...

1641
01:44:19,741 --> 01:44:20,690
N' shook their hand.

1642
01:44:21,942 --> 01:44:23,334
Every single kid.

1643
01:44:26,549 --> 01:44:28,182
Then he came back to his chair.

1644
01:44:28,989 --> 01:44:30,956
I was the last on to shake his hand.

1645
01:44:34,134 --> 01:44:36,235
I held it out and he said,

1646
01:44:37,523 --> 01:44:38,789
"I won't shake your hand."

1647
01:44:41,082 --> 01:44:42,760
"I'm not shaking hands with you."

1648
01:44:46,128 --> 01:44:47,718
"I not shaking hands with you."

1649
01:44:57,606 --> 01:44:59,753
I'm the one who thought the worst about him.

1650
01:45:02,536 --> 01:45:05,308
I feel like... Abe knew that.

1651
01:45:06,878 --> 01:45:08,690
That's why he wouldn't shake my hand.

1652
01:45:16,278 --> 01:45:18,403
Did something happened at Castawo's?

1653
01:45:19,643 --> 01:45:20,223
You see...

1654
01:45:22,198 --> 01:45:24,036
I was always a goody two-shoes.

1655
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:27,582
I guess I still am.

1656
01:45:29,323 --> 01:45:30,273
Can't help it.

1657
01:45:42,134 --> 01:45:44,871
You're acting strange, really different today.

1658
01:45:48,339 --> 01:45:50,198
I don't know what they said to you at Castawo...

1659
01:45:50,374 --> 01:45:51,897
No, honestly no.

1660
01:45:52,368 --> 01:45:54,581
Nobody said anything at Castawo's.

1661
01:45:58,810 --> 01:45:59,631
I'm sorry.

1662
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:04,178
I was just thinking back to when I was a kid

1663
01:46:04,952 --> 01:46:06,678
and feeling sorry for myself.

1664
01:46:09,584 --> 01:46:10,529
How 'bout this...

1665
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:13,420
Maybe Abe...

1666
01:46:14,197 --> 01:46:16,486
Wouldn't shake your hand, because he liked you and

1667
01:46:16,785 --> 01:46:18,259
didn't want to say goodbye.

1668
01:46:20,751 --> 01:46:23,197
The girls he liked in class he would be nice to.

1669
01:46:23,830 --> 01:46:25,392
In front of me he acted all tough.

1670
01:46:26,681 --> 01:46:29,626
His hands jammed in pockets, using bad language,

1671
01:46:29,743 --> 01:46:32,009
swaggering around, spitting as he walked.

1672
01:46:34,375 --> 01:46:35,548
He was a little thug.

1673
01:46:36,329 --> 01:46:37,072
There you go.

1674
01:46:38,084 --> 01:46:39,580
It's just what boys do.

1675
01:46:40,631 --> 01:46:44,376
When I was little, I would tease the
girl I liked until she ran off home.

1676
01:46:44,508 --> 01:46:46,052
It's not the same Toshio.

1677
01:46:46,445 --> 01:46:49,415
I mean, he didn't skip anyone except for me.

1678
01:46:49,758 --> 01:46:51,081
I was the only one.

1679
01:46:51,083 --> 01:46:53,876
Well... Its like the saying goes. You know...

1680
01:46:55,210 --> 01:46:57,876
"Girls are always blind to the love of boys."

1681
01:46:58,225 --> 01:47:00,275
Huh. Do you really believe that?

1682
01:47:00,927 --> 01:47:02,392
Sure, it's obvious.

1683
01:47:04,273 --> 01:47:06,689
And it always has been so.

1684
01:47:08,290 --> 01:47:10,111
Abe wasn't really all that tough.

1685
01:47:10,412 --> 01:47:12,853
He couldn't act that way. Not with the boys.

1686
01:47:15,887 --> 01:47:18,191
I guess with you it was easy for him to act tough.

1687
01:47:18,279 --> 01:47:20,402
After all you sat right next to him in class.

1688
01:47:21,473 --> 01:47:23,691
He was taking advantage of the situation.

1689
01:47:24,402 --> 01:47:28,012
Hey, theirs no way he wanted to
shake hands with the whole class.

1690
01:47:28,375 --> 01:47:30,449
Your the only one he was honest about.

1691
01:47:31,116 --> 01:47:33,629
"I'm not shaking hands with you.", yea?

1692
01:47:57,864 --> 01:47:58,375
Ptui.

1693
01:47:59,498 --> 01:48:00,628
Knock it off huh.

1694
01:48:32,727 --> 01:48:33,086
Ptui.

1695
01:48:39,203 --> 01:48:39,560
Ptui.

1696
01:48:40,458 --> 01:48:40,811
Ptui.

1697
01:48:42,980 --> 01:48:43,242
Ptui.

1698
01:48:45,468 --> 01:48:45,779
Ptui.

1699
01:48:45,781 --> 01:48:50,101
I remember... I felt so bad for Abe and so guilty.

1700
01:48:51,555 --> 01:48:52,950
That I imitated him.

1701
01:48:55,899 --> 01:48:57,066
But it was too late.

1702
01:48:57,631 --> 01:48:58,856
The damage was done.

1703
01:48:59,433 --> 01:49:01,810
I couldn't undo what happened or my feelings of hate.

1704
01:49:01,826 --> 01:49:03,320
The fact is I hurt him.

1705
01:49:12,756 --> 01:49:15,072
Ah... Looks like it stopped raining.

1706
01:49:16,443 --> 01:49:17,373
That's nice.

1707
01:49:22,753 --> 01:49:23,824
Check out the moon.

1708
01:49:34,665 --> 01:49:37,884
Sometimes at night you can see tanuki and foxes out here.

1709
01:49:38,511 --> 01:49:39,110
Yeah?

1710
01:49:40,844 --> 01:49:41,836
Shall we get going?

1711
01:49:42,945 --> 01:49:45,892
Oh dear, they'll be worrying back at the house.

1712
01:49:49,667 --> 01:49:52,821
And... There'll be a few rumors
flying around, that's for sure.

1713
01:49:53,783 --> 01:49:56,790
I'm sorry, I've put you in an embarrassing position.

1714
01:49:58,060 --> 01:50:00,650
They sure wonder what happened at Castawo's today.

1715
01:50:00,870 --> 01:50:02,298
Don't ask them about it.

1716
01:50:02,472 --> 01:50:04,907
I'm serious. Promise me that you won't.

1717
01:50:09,331 --> 01:50:10,251
OK then,

1718
01:50:10,644 --> 01:50:11,673
a little music?

1719
01:50:50,632 --> 01:50:55,320
For the very first time, I'm thinking all
these things and feeling all these feelings.

1720
01:50:55,788 --> 01:50:57,617
Of my feelings towards Toshio,

1721
01:50:58,156 --> 01:51:00,093
of his feelings towards me.

1722
01:51:00,805 --> 01:51:05,203
Did I just open my confused head
and convoluted heart to this guy?

1723
01:51:05,943 --> 01:51:06,767
I did.

1724
01:51:07,655 --> 01:51:10,384
And yet, it was as easy as breathing in...

1725
01:51:11,743 --> 01:51:12,571
And breathing out.

1726
01:51:13,455 --> 01:51:16,837
I'm amazed at how I'd been
able to fall back on him that way.

1727
01:51:17,528 --> 01:51:18,665
I felt as if...

1728
01:51:19,195 --> 01:51:20,704
As if I'd always known him.

1729
01:51:22,014 --> 01:51:24,321
As if he was part of my own past.

1730
01:51:25,569 --> 01:51:28,040
And the one I wanted a hand shake from most was...

1731
01:51:28,574 --> 01:51:29,275
Toshio.

1732
01:51:31,916 --> 01:51:33,103
Just a hand shake.

1733
01:52:04,666 --> 01:52:05,833
What is this feeling?

1734
01:52:06,884 --> 01:52:09,161
Thinking about it with him so close to me.

1735
01:52:11,034 --> 01:52:11,864
I wonder?

1736
01:52:39,394 --> 01:52:41,053
Taeko, do you have everything?

1737
01:52:41,592 --> 01:52:43,120
Yes, I think so.

1738
01:52:43,722 --> 01:52:45,401
All right, see you in the winter then.

1739
01:52:45,746 --> 01:52:49,222
Yup, I'll read up on agriculture
for the next time I see you.

1740
01:52:49,866 --> 01:52:51,737
Huh?? Your not coming to ski?

1741
01:52:52,619 --> 01:52:54,784
The only way to learn is to do it, you know.

1742
01:52:55,417 --> 01:52:58,732
Give some thought to what we talked about, alrighty?

1743
01:52:58,862 --> 01:52:59,987
Huh?? What was that?

1744
01:53:00,394 --> 01:53:00,991
Yeah?

1745
01:53:01,708 --> 01:53:04,853
Don't you worry, that's between Taeko and me.

1746
01:53:05,789 --> 01:53:09,509
Hmm, did something go on yesterday between you two?

1747
01:53:10,095 --> 01:53:12,213
I'm sorry... And I'm fine.

1748
01:53:12,642 --> 01:53:15,251
Next time I won't bring along my 5th grade self.

1749
01:53:28,754 --> 01:53:29,960
Hold that train!

1750
01:53:31,990 --> 01:53:33,857
Take care of yourself, Naoko.

1751
01:53:42,847 --> 01:53:43,744
Goodbye.

1752
01:53:44,227 --> 01:53:45,106
Goodbye.
