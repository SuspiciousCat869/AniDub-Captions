First question.

00:40:14.634 --> 00:40:16.335 position:19% line:83% align:start
What brings you here to
our little village,

But my Auntie
thought it best

00:40:34.353 --> 00:40:37.558 position:16% line:83% align:start
that I came here and stay
with her relatives, the Oiwas.

Who's Auntie?

00:40:38.759 --> 00:40:41.294 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now it's my turn
to ask a question!

00:40:41.328 --> 00:40:44.298 position:21% line:83% align:start
So how is it that you
live in that mansion?

They can only
come sometimes.

Uh huh.

00:40:59.513 --> 00:41:02.616 position:24% line:83% align:start

Tell me, who's Auntie?

She's my guardian.

like a mother, but

me when I'm being a total pain.

Every month...
we've been receiving subsidies

01:33:38.379 --> 01:33:41.516 position:24% line:83% align:start
from the government
to cover your expenses.

01:33:41.549 --> 01:33:43.284 position:13% line:89% align:start
We didn't want you to know.

01:33:43.317 --> 01:33:46.487 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't know why but
we just didn't. It just felt...

01:33:46.521 --> 01:33:49.791 position:33% line:83% align:start
- It's fine.
- You must believe me, Anna.

01:33:49.824 --> 01:33:51.826 position:30% line:83% align:start
Whether or not
we receive money,

01:33:51.859 --> 01:33:55.430 position:19% line:83% align:start
nothing can change how
we feel about you.

01:33:55.463 --> 01:33:57.298 position:30% line:89% align:start
I already knew.

01:33:57.331 --> 01:33:59.400 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm happy you told me about
it anyway and I'm really-

01:33:59.434 --> 01:34:00.668 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh Anna!

[Anna sighs]

01:34:06.875 --> 01:34:10.344 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've been looking at all the
photos you'd sent up here.

01:34:10.378 --> 01:34:11.245 position:41% line:89% align:start
Photos?

01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:14.482 position:38% line:83% align:start
Oh, yes.
While you were away,

01:34:14.515 --> 01:34:16.584 position:27% line:83% align:start
I was looking at
old photo albums

01:34:16.618 --> 01:34:18.352 position:16% line:89% align:start
and I found this picture.

01:34:19.353 --> 01:34:20.488 position:27% line:89% align:start
Do you remember?

01:34:20.989 --> 01:34:21.990 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Anna gasps]

01:34:22.825 --> 01:34:24.325 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's the Marsh House!

01:34:24.358 --> 01:34:27.963 position:13% line:83% align:start
When you first came to us,
you wouldn't let it go.

01:34:27.996 --> 01:34:30.331 position:5% line:89% align:start
Someone at the orphanage told me

01:34:30.364 --> 01:34:32.568 position:5% line:89% align:start
it belonged to your grandmother.

01:34:40.409 --> 01:34:42.544 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Anna]
My beloved home.

01:34:44.012 --> 01:34:45.380 position:41% line:89% align:start

01:35:37.967 --> 01:35:41.336 position:5% line:89% align:start
Of course, I was ever so scared.

01:35:41.370 --> 01:35:44.541 position:21% line:83% align:start
But then, that's when
your grandpa came.

01:35:44.574 --> 01:35:48.444 position:27% line:83% align:start
He encouraged me,
saying I did well.

01:35:48.478 --> 01:35:51.948 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've overcome many
frightening things in life.

And Anna, so will you.

01:35:54.984 --> 01:35:55.952 position:35% line:89% align:start
After all,

01:35:55.985 --> 01:35:57.854 position:13% line:89% align:start
you're my only grandchild.

01:35:57.887 --> 01:36:01.591 position:21% line:83% align:start

now and forever.

I'm sorry about the other day.

Next year, you better join
us for trash pickup.

Uh, maybe.

01:37:18.936 --> 01:37:20.537 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hi Hisako!

01:37:24.074 --> 01:37:24.608 position:33% line:89% align:start
Anna. Hello.

01:37:25.809 --> 01:37:28.679 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm... I'm going
home to Sapporo now.

01:37:28.712 --> 01:37:30.514 position:30% line:89% align:start
Is that right?

01:37:30.547 --> 01:37:31.982 position:30% line:83% align:start
Judging by the
look on your face,

01:37:32.016 --> 01:37:34.652 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'd say something
good has happened.

01:37:34.685 --> 01:37:37.755 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yes, lots of good things.
I'm really happy now.

01:37:37.788 --> 01:37:38.789 position:44% line:89% align:start
Good.

01:37:39.823 --> 01:37:42.127 position:30% line:83% align:start
And this is...
this is my mother.

Thank... thank you very much

01:37:44.996 --> 01:37:47.098 position:33% line:83% align:start
for all your
kindness with Anna.

Truly, it was my pleasure.

- shall we, Anna?
- Yes!

01:37:53.104 --> 01:37:54.505 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll write you a letter.

01:37:54.538 --> 01:37:56.540 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have some wonderful
news to tell you.
