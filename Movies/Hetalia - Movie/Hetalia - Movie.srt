No, it's still too early.
First we must pacify

00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:14,666
them with gifts and make sure
they are feeling relaxed and

956
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:18,583
happy before they leave. We can
talk the treaty on another day.

That is secret
to good reception.

I am curious, Britain. What
did you put into gift bags?

967
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:41,458
Isn't it obvious?

pissed off the Pictos.

are so yummy.

ashore onto the beach.

I won't ask for water.
If only I could have

1111
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:59,375
some beer to moisten my throat.
I won't ask for food either.

If only I had some wurst
to satisfy my hunger.

I'm wicked good at
that kind of thing!

I brought my entire country

You don't have an entire

How odd. I live alone you know.

it's just the long trip.

out of exhaustion.

Sir Britain. Perhaps
you should take a bath and

1164
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:10,583
go get some rest.

simply a cultural difference.

you very much, gov'ner.

could you fill me in a bit

1179

about Japanese culture?

Sure! No one
could inform you

more about that particular
topic than us, right?

the sushi you are familiar

created. Did you know that?

No--I had no idea.

always just check out Wiki.

distracted while chatting

were already in there.

[BRITAIN] It was
rather fun, wasn't it?

1202
00:58:46,875 --> 00:58:48,875
We should take a bath
together again tomorrow.

1203
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:52,750
[laughs] Oh, we would love
to, but we were just about

1204
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:55,000
to leave this area
for the mountains.

We were taking a bath

1207
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:00,458
to celebrate our last day here.

1208

Arigato!

1209
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:07,833
[KAPPA] Long ago, although
humans were afraid of us,

1210
00:59:07,916 --> 00:59:10,375
they still believed
we were real. In a way,

1211
00:59:10,458 --> 00:59:14,250
I guess you could say we had a
mutual respect for each other.

1212
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:18,208
But then something changed.
Before we knew it, our very

1213
00:59:18,291 --> 00:59:21,416
existence became nothing more
than a silly superstition

1214
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,916
to people.

1215
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,583
[KAPPA] We used to be able
to talk to Mister Japan, too.

1216
00:59:25,666 --> 00:59:28,416
[GOBLIN] Nowadays, he
won't even look at us.

1217
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,250
But still, that
doesn't mean you both

1218
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:31,458
have to leave, does it?

1219
00:59:31,541 --> 00:59:33,833
[KAPPA] Yes. I guess
you could say we feel

1220
00:59:33,916 --> 00:59:38,166
as if we've overstayed our
welcome. But, it was a pleasure

1221
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:42,166
for us to spend our last
hours here with you.

1222

1223

1224
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,041

should still get together

1225

forgot about it.

pasta is pretty rockin',

Yes, I like it!

go home already?

he can sleep so easily.

1251
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:52,250
He's tired. After all he
did make us all dinner,

1252
01:00:52,333 --> 01:00:54,041
which was very
delectable if you ask me.

1253

Hey I helped make
it, too, ass!

I am wondering
about Pictonian.

Why did they stop the
attacking of us when Italy

started talking to them?

[AMERICA and CHINA] Uh...

Oh?

We don't know. We don't know.

1421
01:10:41,416 --> 01:10:43,666
Hey there, Grandpa Rome!

1422
01:10:52,291 --> 01:10:54,833
Why is there a marker
on the ground?

1423
01:10:54,916 --> 01:10:58,083
I wonder if Grandpa Rome
maybe left it here.

1424
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:02,000
Oh. Yeah!

01:11:09,958 --> 01:11:12,041
Seriously!

1429

[PICTONIAN K] A face?

[ITALY] I found Germany!

It looks exactly like you!

with all your weirdo faces?

your face is weird, too.

Do I look weird, as well?

1450

I'd rather be--

1451
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:13,000
[JAPAN] Everyone.
What is happening to Germany?

1452
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:14,375

1453
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,250
[ITALY] Hey!
Germany turned back!

1454

to the normal China,
just like Germany.

to see you hands!

have so much fun!

[JAPAN] I think
I might be smiling.

1460

[GERMANY] Italy.
You did wunderbar.

Ha ha!

[ITALY] Hetalia! Hetalia!

1463
01:12:45,875 --> 01:12:48,375
Ciao Japan.
Guess what I heard.

1464
01:12:48,458 --> 01:12:50,500
Germany said you were
good at miniaturizing.

1465
01:12:50,583 --> 01:12:52,125
Do you think you
could shrink me, too?

1466
01:12:52,208 --> 01:12:54,000
Apologies, but no.
We are not currently

miniaturize Ita--

1468

[GERMANY] Why the heck
is this guy such a putz?

1473
01:13:14,833 --> 01:13:17,375
I ate some really weird
British pizza the other day.

1474
01:13:17,458 --> 01:13:19,583
It kinda tasted like
fish and vinegar.

1475
01:13:19,666 --> 01:13:22,208
[GERMANY] He's supposed to
be a descendant of mighty Rome

1476
01:13:22,291 --> 01:13:24,583
so it's not a problem
with his genetics.

1477
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:27,833
Look, Germany. Someone's
teaching a lesson.

1478
01:13:28,958 --> 01:13:30,458
[MAN] The flavonids
in tomatoes cause those

1479

who ingest too much to become
unnaturally good humored

1480
01:13:32,916 --> 01:13:35,958
but pathetically weak.
However our latest research

1481
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:37,958
has but cracked the
surface of this phenomena.

1482
01:13:38,041 --> 01:13:40,250
It's funny. That professor
guy doesn't know it

1483
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:41,875
but he just said
'butt crack."

1485

awesomely the first one here!

1488
01:13:51,708 --> 01:13:53,125
Now I can say:

1489
01:13:53,208 --> 01:13:55,333
[AMERICA] Say, aren't you
running a little late?

1490

Those losers are
totally going to feel like

1491

[AMERICA] It's Britain!

1493
01:14:01,958 --> 01:14:05,708
All right. That
should do the trick.

1494
01:14:06,416 --> 01:14:07,791
[AMERICA] The portraits!
Britain was drawing them

1495
01:14:07,875 --> 01:14:08,916
the whole time?

01:14:11,041 --> 01:14:13,208
[CHINA] What's up with
these weird drawings?

1498
01:14:13,291 --> 01:14:16,583
[FRANCE] They're even worse
than our actual animation.

Who drew this crap?

1500
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:19,875
It does not capture the
essence of my natural beauty!

1501
01:14:19,958 --> 01:14:21,625
Yes, and I have a
unibrow for some reason.

1502
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:23,083
[CHINA] I think the ones
at the bottom are best.

1503

[RUSSIA] If that one
is supposed to be of me.

1504

I'll hack it out
with my pickaxe.

[AMERICA] Uhh...

1507
01:14:29,166 --> 01:14:30,750
Well, that's just annoying!

1508
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:34,083
Why would someone choose
to draw us in such a fashion?

1509
01:14:34,166 --> 01:14:35,500
It's unforgiveable really--

1510
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:37,750
How dare that mysterious
person flexibly express all of

1511
01:14:37,833 --> 01:14:40,125
our individual characteristics
with skilled sketches using

1512
01:14:40,208 --> 01:14:42,750
boldly formed, innovative and
cutesy American pop art styles

in New York City!

1514

we have caused you
and your people.

1528
01:16:01,541 --> 01:16:04,791
Our initial goal was to conquer
this planet and assimilate you

1529
01:16:04,875 --> 01:16:08,583
to our image. But,
after seeing how much fun

1530
01:16:08,666 --> 01:16:11,500

we've decided we do not wish

1531
01:16:11,583 --> 01:16:13,458
to change anything about it.

1532
01:16:13,541 --> 01:16:16,291
Instead, we would like to
thank you for changing us

1533

and for giving us faces.
To show our gratitude,

1534

we will turn all humans
back to their original form

and transport them to their
individual countries. Also...

Would you mind
giving that to me?

don't you think?

[SWITZERLAND] I guess.

1556
01:17:53,583 --> 01:17:55,291
So is anybody having
idea how we will

return to our homes?

have asked them

to give us a lift

your fault.

01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,208
[FRANCE] How the
hell should I know?

1575
01:18:30,291 --> 01:18:34,083
[ITALY] Cool! I want
to dance! I like to dance!

1576
01:18:38,833 --> 01:18:40,458
[SEALAND] I can do it, too!

[PICTONIAN language]

1578
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:56,750
[ICELAND] So, I don't know what
the deal is with these guys,

1579
01:20:56,833 --> 01:21:00,000
but thanks to them we can see
auroras anytime of the year now,

1580
01:21:00,083 --> 01:21:03,041
which means we have
more tourists. Lucky us.

1581
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:04,958
[KIDS] The end!
