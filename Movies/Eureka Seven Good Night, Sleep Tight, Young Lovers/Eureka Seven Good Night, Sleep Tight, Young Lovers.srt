1
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:31,458
- Renton: ON THE DAY OUR TEACHER
ASKED US TO MEET HIM,

2
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:33,791
WE CLIMBED UP THE HILL
BEHIND THE HOUSING COMPLEX.

3
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,958
AT THE TIME, I COULDN'T
UNDERSTAND WHY OUR TEACHER,

4
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,416
WHO WAS NORMALLY
SUCH A HARD-ASS,

5
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,791
WOULD SUDDENLY ASK US
TO JOIN HIM,

6
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,583
OR WHY HE WOULD SUGGEST
THAT WE ALL CLIMB THE HILL
OF ALL THINGS.

7
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:52,041
ALL I KNEW WAS THAT
HE WASN'T BEING
HIS USUAL STRICT SELF,

8
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:54,666
AND I GUESS I WAS KINDA HAPPY
TO HEAR HIM INVITE US ALONG

9
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,416
IN SUCH A KIND VOICE
FOR A CHANGE.

10
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:01,000
IT WAS THE FIRST AND LAST TIME
I SAW SUCH A KINDHEARTED LOOK

11
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:04,291
ON OUR TEACHER'S...
ON PROFESSOR DOMINIC'S FACE.

12
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,958
- Dominic: ARE YOU
ABLE TO KEEP UP, RENTON?

13
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:12,750
- UH? YEAH, I'M OKAY PROFESSOR.

14
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:13,666
- AND EUREKA?

15
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:19,791
- HEY! EUREKA!
WHAT'S THE BIG HOLD-UP?

16
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:23,625
- RENTON! NIRVASH ISN'T
FOLLOWING US ANYMORE!

17
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:28,416
- AW, NOT AGAIN.
I CAN'T BELIEVE HIM.

18
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,250
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WHAT DID YOU STOP FOR?

19
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,583
COME ON, NIRVASH, HURRY UP!

20
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:36,416
- HEY! GET MOVING NIRVASH!

21
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,750
- HURRY UP, NIRVASH! COME ON!

22
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,791
- Both: NIRVASH!

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,291
- Renton: WHAT'S THE MATTER?
LET'S GET MOVING!

24
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,375
- ( squeaking )

25
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:50,000
- NIRVASH! LET'S GO!

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,250
- WHOA!
- RENTON!

27
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,875
- CUT IT OUT! COME ON!

28
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,250
( laughing )

29
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:09,708
UH-OH, MOM'S GONNA
CHEW ME OUT AGAIN.

30
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,041
- ( Nirvash squeaks )

31
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,458
- I SWEAR, IT'S ALWAYS
YOUR FAULT, YOU KNOW.

32
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:17,541
- ( exclaims ) HE'S ALL
SOFT AND SQUISHY!

33
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,708
- ( squeaks )
- HEY! WHAT GIVES!

34
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,750
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN
TO SCARE HER LIKE THAT!

35
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,875
- ( squeaks )
- WHAT? OH, REALLY?

36
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,791
HEY, DON'T WORRY, IT'S OKAY.

37
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,583
HE SAID WHEN YOU PET HIM
LIKE THAT IT TICKLES.

38
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:35,166
- SO DOES THAT MEAN
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
WHAT HE'S SAYING, RENTON?

39
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,833
- HUH? YEAH.

40
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:41,250
- Dominic: YOU'RE PRETTY
AMAZING, RENTON.

41
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,208
PEOPLE CAN'T NORMALLY UNDERSTAND
WHAT LARVAE ARE SAYING TO THEM.

42
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,791
WHO KNOWS, MAYBE YOU ARE
THE CHOSEN ONE.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,041
- ( squeaks excitedly )
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, NIRVASH?

44
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,416
EUREKA!

45
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,375
NO, STOP! IF EUREKA IS HIT
BY SUNLIGHT, SHE'LL...

46
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,125
- Dominic: DON'T WORRY.

47
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:11,875
THIS IS ALL ARTIFICIAL LIGHT.
IT WON'T DO ANY HARM TO EUREKA.

48
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,000
- ARE YOU SURE?

49
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,875
- AS LONG AS SHE'S NOT
HIT BY REAL SUNLIGHT,
SHE'LL BE JUST FINE.

50
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,166
- PROFESSOR? LOOKS LIKE
THAT SHIP IS BROKEN.

51
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,666
- IT'S NOT MERELY BROKEN,
RENTON, IT'S BEEN ATTACKED.

52
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,541
- IT WAS ATTACKED?
- YES.

53
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:37,125
RIGHT NOW, HUMANITY IS
AT WAR WITH A MYSTERIOUS
ENEMY CALLED EIZO

54
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,750
THAT ARE INVADING THE EARTH.

55
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,458
- HOW COME
WE CAN'T ALL BE FRIENDS?

56
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,625
IF WE WERE FRIENDS,
THEN THE WAR WOULD END,

57
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:49,000
RIGHT, PROFESSOR? PROFESSOR?

58
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,458
PROFESSOR? WHAT ARE YOU
DOING DOWN THERE?

59
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:09,208
- FOUND IT!
HERE, TAKE A LOOK.

60
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:17,250
- HEY, PROFESSOR,
WHAT KIND OF PLANT IS THIS?

61
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,750
- IT'S NOT A PLANT. IT'S KNOWN
AS A SNOW MOON FLOWER.

62
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,958
- IT'S CALLED
A SNOW MOON FLOWER?

63
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,500
- THAT'S RIGHT.

64
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,708
JUST BEFORE THE END OF WINTER
EACH YEAR, THESE FLOWERS BLOOM.

65
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,333
- NIRVASH! COME ON OVER HERE!

66
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,916
- STILL BURIED IN THE SNOW
LIKE THIS.
- COME ON, NIRVASH!

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,375
NIRVASH, COME HERE AND LOOK
AT THE REALLY CUTE PLANT!

68
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,416
- I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

69
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,166
- YOU KNOW THERE'S A LEGEND
THAT GOES ALONG WITH
THIS FLOWER.

70
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,625
- YEAH? WHAT IS IT?

71
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,458
- IT'S SAID THAT ONCE
EVERY HUNDRED YEARS,

72
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:45,166
ON DAYS WHEN STARDUST FALLS,
SNOW MOON FLOWERS BLOSSOM

73
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,166
AND SHINE WITH
THE LIGHT OF A RAINBOW.

74
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,208
- STARDUST? WHAT'S THAT?

75
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:53,250
- BEATS ME. I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IT MEANS, EITHER.

76
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,166
- WOW, THERE ARE THINGS
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW?

77
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,500
- OF COURSE.
BUT I DO KNOW THIS MUCH.

78
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,208
IF YOU MAKE A WISH
INSIDE ITS RAINBOW LIGHT,

79
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,458
THAT WISH IS SURE TO COME TRUE.

80
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,208
- YOU CAN WISH FOR ANYTHING?
- YEAH.

81
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:11,583
- WILL IT BLOOM TODAY?
- MAYBE, MAYBE NOT.

82
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,666
EUREKA? IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT YOU WANT TO WISH FOR?

83
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,125
- WHAT?

84
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:19,458
- PROFESSOR DOMINIC SAID
WHEN THIS SHINES LIKE A RAINBOW,

85
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,583
WHATEVER YOU WISH FOR
WILL COME TRUE, SEE?

86
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:25,666
- UM, I GUESS THERE IS A WISH
THAT I WANT TO MAKE.

87
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,166
- WHAT IS IT?

88
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,083
- WELL, I HEAR ALL KINDS OF
STORIES COMING FROM RENTON

89
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,458
ABOUT THE INTERESTING THINGS
HE'S SEEN.

90
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,416
LIKE HOW HE SAW
BIRDS FLYING IN THE SKY.

91
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,958
OR HOW ONE TIME HE
ACTUALLY SAW A BUTTERFLY
HATCH FROM A COCOON!

92
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,916
OR ABOUT HOW THIS OTHER TIME
HE CAUGHT A FISH IN THE RIVER!

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,583
OR ABOUT A HUGE RAINBOW
THAT HE SAW UP IN THE SKY!

94
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,666
LOTS AND LOTS OF THINGS!

95
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,041
AND SO I WANT TO SEE
ALL THOSE THINGS FOR MYSELF!

96
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,541
I WANT TO SEE THEM
TOGETHER WITH RENTON!

97
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,541
THAT'S MY WISH.
WILL IT COME TRUE?

98
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,166
- HEY, PROFESSOR DOMINIC, LOOK!
THE FLOWER!

99
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,750
- ( exclaims ) HOW PRETTY!

100
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,458
- LOOK AT THAT, ITS SEEDS ARE...

101
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:11,875
- ( Eureka gasps )

102
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:17,708
- Dominic: THE FLOWER!

103
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,708
IT DIDN'T WORK.

104
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,916
- PROFESSOR, WHAT WAS
THAT JUST NOW?

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,541
- WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FLOWER?
- I'M AFRAID IT DIED.

106
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,958
- LET'S LOOK AROUND
AND SEE IF THERE'S MORE!

107
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,291
- NO, IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

108
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,541
- ( Eureka sighs
in disappointment )

109
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,625
- HERE. TAKE THESE.
YOU TWO CAN HAVE THEM.

110
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,125
- YOU MEAN IT'S SEEDS?

111
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,958
- WHY DON'T YOU USE THEM
AS GOOD LUCK CHARMS?

112
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,208
THEY SHOULDN'T GO TO WASTE.

113
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,125
NOW WOULD YOU DO ME ONE FAVOR?

114
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,875
- WHAT IS IT?

115
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:55,875
- I HAVE TO GO AWAY
FOR A LITTLE WHILE TO
WORK ON AN EXPERIMENT.

116
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,791
WOULD YOU TWO
WATCH OVER THIS HILL FOR ME?

117
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:02,083
I WANT YOU TO WATCH OVER
THIS HILL WHERE THE SNOW
MOON FLOWER BLOOMS.

118
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,166
AND THEN ONE DAY, SEE TO IT
THAT A FLOWER BLOOMS HERE

119
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,125
WITH ALL THE COLORS
OF THE RAINBOW.

120
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,750
I'M COUNTING ON YOU.

121
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:16,500
- Renton: THE NEXT MORNING,
PROFESSOR DOMINIC LEFT TOWN
WITHOUT EVEN SAYING GOODBYE.

122
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:19,750
IT WAS ONLY A WEEK LATER THAT
WE LEARNED THAT HE HAD DIED.

123
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,625
I DON'T KNOW ANY OF THE DETAILS
OF WHAT HAPPENED,

124
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,791
BUT EVEN AS YOUNG AS I WAS,

125
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,041
I KNEW THAT PROFESSOR DOMINIC
HAD DIED IN
ONE OF MY FATHER'S EXPERIMENTS

126
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,833
LOOKING FOR A WAY TO DEFEAT
THE INVADING EIZO,

127
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,208
MANKIND'S MORTAL ENEMY.

128
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,041
AND THEN
THAT FATEFUL DAY ARRIVED.


129
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,541
- Soldier: ON BEHALF OF
THE GOVERNMENT,

130
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:55,250
THE LIBERATION ARMY WILL
SECURE AND CONDUCT A SEARCH
OF THE WARSAWA LABORATORIES.

131
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,583
- Eureka: RENTON, I'M SO SCARED.

132
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,291
- IT'S OKAY, EUREKA.

133
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:02,625
THE PEOPLE WHO WORK HERE
AREN'T DOING ANYTHING WRONG.

134
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,000
MOM AND DAD TOLD ME
THAT THE WARSAWA LABS

135
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:08,708
WERE CONDUCTING VERY
IMPORTANT RESEARCH
THAT WOULD SAVE HUMANITY.

136
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,875
- I'M STILL REALLY SCARED.

137
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,750
- IT'LL BE OKAY. I'M POSITIVE
THAT THESE WILL PROTECT US.

138
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,166
- THEY WILL?

139
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,250
- YEP. THE SEEDS THAT
PROFESSOR DOMINIC GAVE US.

140
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,750
- ( whoops )

141
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,416
- THAT'S WHY I'M NOT WORRIED.
- ( door opens with a bang )

142
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,500
- ( guns cocking )
- SUBJECT LOCATED!

143
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,083
CAPTURE IT!

144
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:31,875
YOU LITTLE...

145
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,208
- ( Nirvash whimpers )

146
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,250
- NIRVASH, NO!
- NO! ( exclaims )

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,875
- LET GO OF HER! LET GO!
LET GO OF EUREKA!

148
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,500
- NO! ( screaming )

149
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,583
- Soldier: EXPOSE THE SUBJECT
TO SUNLIGHT TO VERIFY IDENTITY!

150
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:49,791
- LET ME GO! LET ME GO!

151
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,125
- RENTON! HELP ME, PLEASE!
- NO, DON'T!

152
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,166
DON'T LET THE LIGHT
HIT EUREKA!

153
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,416
- HELP ME, RENTON!
HELP ME! HELP ME!

154
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,875
( screams ) IT HURTS!

155
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,500
- CONFIRMED!
RETURN TO BASE AT ONCE!

156
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,541
- IT HURTS, RENTON!
MAKE IT STOP! (crying)

157
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,666
- Renton: NO MATTER HOW MUCH
MY HEAD ORDERED MY BODY TO MOVE,

158
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,791
- IT REFUSED.
- PLEASE HELP ME, RENTON.

159
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,750
- EUREKA BEGGED
AND PLEADED FOR HELP,

160
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,916
BUT I WAS SO SCARED
THAT I DIDN'T LIFT
SO MUCH AS A FINGER.

161
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,208
THAT WAS THE MOMENT
WHEN I FIRST LEARNED THAT

162
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,833
I DIDN'T HAVE THE MEANS
OR THE COURAGE

163
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,291
TO PROTECT THE THINGS
THAT WERE PRECIOUS TO ME.

164
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,708
- Talho: THIS IS THE
ASSAULT CARRIER GEKKO,


165
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:49,250
ATTACHED TO
THE LIBERATION ARMY'S 1ST
DIVISION, 303RD REGIMENT.


166
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:53,291
THIS IS CAPTAIN TALHO YUKI,
ADDRESSING ALL PERSONNEL.


167
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,958
OUR MISSION IS THE RETRIEVAL
OF A TOP SECRET ITEM

168
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,791
THAT WAS LEFT BEHIND AT
THE SOUTH DAKOTA MILITARY BASE

169
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,833
THAT IS CURRENTLY UNDER ATTACK
BY EIZO FORCES.

170
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:05,833
ALL KLF STRIKE UNITS
WILL WORK IN UNISON
TO INFILTRATE THE BASE.

171
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,875
GET IN THERE AND
SECURE THAT ITEM!

172
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,625
- Woz: THE EIZO ARE
ADVANCING SOUTHWARDS

173
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,208
TOWARDS CENTRAL SOUTH DAKOTA
AT 51 KNOTS.

174
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,625
ESTIMATED TIME TO FUSION,
600 SECONDS!

175
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,833
- YOU ALL GOT THAT?
WE'RE ON A DEADLINE!

176
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:20,000
THINK OF NOTHING BUT
RETRIEVING THE TOP SECRET ITEM!

177
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,250
THIS IS THE FIRST STEP
IN A PLAN THAT WE
ABSOLUTELY MUST CARRY OUT.

178
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,125
NO MATTER WHAT THE COST.

179
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,375
- ( phone beeps )
- WHAT IS IT?

180
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,833
- Holland: DIAL IT DOWN, TALHO.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

181
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,708
- YOU FAINTED
YESTERDAY, REMEMBER?

182
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,583
DON'T PUSH YOURSELF SO HARD.

183
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,958
- BUT, HOLLAND, THIS OPERATION
IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS

184
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,708
REALIZING ALL OUR,
I MEAN, YOUR DREAMS.

185
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,416
- RIGHT.

186
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,583
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHY
YOU SHOULDN'T PUSH TOO HARD.

187
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,625
- SAME FOR YOU.
DON'T TRY ANYTHING CRAZY.

188
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,125
- Hap: NIRVASH LOCKDOWN
CONFIRMED. DEPLOY CATAPULT.

189
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:57,125
- Renton: IT'LL BE OKAY.
JUST DO IT LIKE
IN THE SIMULATIONS.

190
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,333
- Gidget: TIME DELAY,
17 SECONDS. HURRY THROUGH
THE CHECKLIST!

191
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,750
- YOU CAN DO THIS.
YOU DID FINE IN THE
MOCK DRILLS, RIGHT?

192
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,041
- ( Nirvash squeaks )

193
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,791
- YEAH, YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IF ANYBODY CAN DO THIS, IT'S US.

194
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,333
- ( Nirvash squeaks
in approval )

195
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,750
- Moondoggie: THE GEKKO HAS
JUST BREACHED LINE 5-5-7.

196
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,166
WE HAVE VISUAL CONFIRMATION
OF EIZO.

197
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,666
- Renton: THOSE ARE
HUMANITY'S MORTAL ENEMY.

198
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,916
- THE INVADERS OF OUR WORLD.
- Gidget: CV/GATE
SYNCHRONIZATION CONFIRMED.

199
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,375
- THOSE ARE THE EIZO?
- COURSE IS CLEAR!

200
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,833
ALL RIGHT, NIRVASH,
YOU ARE GO FOR LAUNCH!

201
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,250
- ROGER, THIS IS CORPORAL
RENTON THURSTON.

202
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,375
NIRVASH LAUNCHING NOW!

203
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,583
- Old Anemone: APRIL, 2009 AD.

204
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:45,041
MYSTERIOUS LIFE FORMS
THAT CAME TO BE CALLED THE EIZO

205
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:49,500
SUDDENLY APPEARED IN
THE SOUTH PACIFIC AND
BEGAN AN INVASION OF EARTH.

206
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,750
A WAR BETWEEN THE EIZO
AND HUMANITY BEGAN,

207
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:56,416
AND HAS RAGED FOR 45 YEARS.

208
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,375
UNABLE TO CURB THE EXPLOSIVE
SPEED OF THE EIZO INVASION,

209
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:05,000
IT WAS WIDELY BELIEVED
THAT HUMANITY'S EXTINCTION
WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.

210
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,625
IT IS NOW THE YEAR 2054.

211
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,625
THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO
USE THE "HAMMER OF GOD,"

212
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,500
A DOOMSDAY WEAPON
EMPLOYING SOLAR ENERGY,


213
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,166
TO BURN THE EIZO TO ASHES.


214
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,833
A PLAN WAS SET IN MOTION TO
ELIMINATE OPPOSING FACTIONS


215
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,541
AND TO CONSTRUCT
THE MEGAROAD,


216
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,958
A COLONY SHIP WHICH WOULD
CARRY A SELECT 20,000 PEOPLE


217
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:31,041
TO ESCAPE THE COMING
DEADLY WINTER OF ASH


218
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,458
THAT WOULD ENVELOP THE EARTH.


219
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:37,583
BUT THEN, A TURN OF EVENTS
THAT COULD NOT HAVE PREDICTED
BEGAN TO UNFOLD.

220
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,625
- ( excited squeaks )

221
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:47,666
- WHY, YES, IT WORKS QUITE WELL
AS AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STORY.

222
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,708
HOWEVER, I'M AFRAID
THERE MIGHT NOT BE QUITE
ENOUGH TIME REMAINING

223
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,166
TO GIVE IT A PROPER ENDING.

224
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,875
I BELIEVE THAT I'VE MADE
ALL THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS,

225
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,833
BUT THERE ISN'T
MUCH TIME, DOMINIC.

226
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:04,333
EVEN SO, I INTEND
TO KEEP MY WORD.

227
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,625
AFTER ALL, YOUR STUDENTS
ARE ON THEIR WAY.

228
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:11,875
THE CHILDREN THAT YOU
ENTRUSTED ALL YOUR HOPES TO
ARE COMING HERE.

229
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,333
- ( exclaiming )

230
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:35,750
- ( people screaming )

231
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,416
- MASAO! NO!

232
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,833
MASAO, PLEASE GET UP!

233
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,708
- ( explosion )

234
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,416
- Renton: HURRY, RUN AWAY!

235
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,958
THERE'S A MILITARY PORT 5KM TO
THE EAST! YOU'LL BE SAFE THERE!

236
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:06,833
- ( frantic beeping )

237
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,750
- WHAT THE...

238
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:21,916
THE DEVILFISH? BUT THAT MEANS
COMMANDER HOLLAND.

239
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,333
- HOLY CRAP, THESE THINGS ARE
A LOT STRONGER THAN THEY LOOK.

240
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:25,541
GOT NO CHOICE, THEN.

241
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,666
COMPAC FEEDBACK
SYSTEM, ACTIVATE!


242
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:34,500
WHERE IS IT?
WHERE'S YOUR SOUL?

243
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:40,458
- ( groans )
WHAT'S THIS FEELING?
MY HEART, IT'S...

244
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,458
- WHERE IS IT?

245
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,250
WHERE IN THE HELL ARE
YOU KEEPING YOUR SOUL?

246
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:56,416
I GOT IT!
THAT'S WHERE IT IS!

247
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,833
- THAT WAS COOL.

248
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,375
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, ROOKIE?

249
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:10,041
OUR JOB IS TO RETRIEVE
THAT TOP SECRET ITEM.

250
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,750
WE'RE NOT HERE
ON A RESCUE MISSION.

251
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,958
- BUT I--
- NO "BUT"S!

252
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,833
IF THIS OPERATION
DOESN'T SUCCEED,

253
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,791
IT'S THE END OF THE ROAD
FOR US.

254
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,291
WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO
SAVE THE LIVES OF STRANGERS!

255
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,208
IF YOU WANT TO LIVE,
YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT.

256
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,500
I'M GOING ON AHEAD.

257
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,791
- COMMANDER...

258
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,583
I HAVE TO SURVIVE.

259
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,083
SURVIVE, NO MATTER WHAT.

260
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,750
ALL RIGHT THEN, COME ON NOW,
NIRVASH, LET'S DO THIS!

261
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,250
NIRVASH?

262
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:49,208
HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU,
NIRVASH? HURRY UP AND MOVE!

263
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,958
- ( squeaks )
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "MUKYUU"?

264
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,416
- ( continues squeaking )
- YOU FOUND HER?

265
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,000
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
FOUND WHO?

266
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,250
- Gidget: MESSAGE FROM
THE FLAGSHIP SHINANO!

267
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,458
EIZO ADVANCE IS ACCELERATING!

268
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,041
THEY WILL CROSS THE ALERT LINE
IN... THEY'VE CROSSED IT!

269
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,666
- WHAT'S THE TIME DELAY?
- PLUS 1-4-6!

270
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,291
- CONTACT WITH THE TARGET?

271
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,250
- NOT YET!
- DAMN!

272
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,708
- Talho: THIS IS THE GEKKO.

273
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,541
HOLLAND, THE EIZO ARE ADVANCING
EVEN FASTER THAN EXPECTED.

274
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,291
AT THIS RATE,
THEY'LL GET THE DROP ON US!

275
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,416
- YEAH I KNOW, I KNOW!

276
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,833
THERE'S JUST TOO MANY
OF THESE CREEPS!

277
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,625
WHAT THE...
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

278
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,208
- Renton: HEY!
WHAT'S THE MATTER, NIRVASH?

279
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,791
- ( squeaks excitedly )

280
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,458
- I DON'T WANNA HEAR
ANY OF YOUR "MUKYUUS"!

281
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,708
DON'T MOVE ON YOUR OWN,
DAMN IT!

282
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,000
STOP! I SAID STOP!

283
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,625
( screaming )

284
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,833
- HEY! NIRVASH HAS BAILED OUT!
- HE BAILED OUT?

285
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,083
- KEEP IT TOGETHER!
HE JUST FELL OFF HIS BOARD!

286
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,833
HE WASN'T SHOT DOWN!

287
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,458
- ( groans )

288
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:55,916
- ( Nirvash squeaks )

289
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,583
- NIRVASH?

290
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,791
OH, NIRVASH,
IS THAT REALLY YOU?

291
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,041
- ( Nirvash squeaks happily )

292
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:17,000
- EUREKA? I CAN'T BELIEVE IT,
IT'S YOU!

293
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,791
- NO WAY! RENTON?

294
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:24,041
RENTON, IS IT YOU?
IS THAT REALLY YOU, RENTON?

295
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:27,166
- Woz: NIRVASH IS REPORTING
CONTACT WITH TARGET CONFIRMED!

296
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,583
COORDINATES, 0080 BY 0083!

297
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,583
- SEND THE MOBILE UNITS
RETRIEVAL ORDERS!

298
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,416
- ROGER THAT!

299
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,333
I CAN'T BELIEVE OUR ROOKIE
MANAGED TO BREAK THROUGH
ALL BY HIMSELF.

300
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,541
IS IT A SIMPLE COINCIDENCE?

301
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,791
OR IS THERE SOME STRANGE POWER
AT WORK HERE?

302
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,625
AS PEOPLE WHO HAVE
ROLES TO PLAY IN THE MYTH.

303
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,541
- Renton: I ALWAYS BELIEVED IT.

304
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:52,333
ALL THIS TIME, I BELIEVED
THAT I'D SEE YOU ONE DAY.

305
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:56,750
I MISSED YOU!
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH! I...

306
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:01,791
- EUREKA!
- IT'S A MIRACLE.

307
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,083
RIGHT AT THE VERY END,
A MIRACLE HAPPENED.

308
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,791
RENTON, IT REALLY IS YOU!

309
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,291
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH, TOO.

310
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,708
- ( distant explosion )
- THEY'RE COMING!

311
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,791
LET'S GO, EUREKA! QUICK!
COME ON, GET IN!

312
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,583
- I'M SORRY, I CAN'T GO.

313
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,333
- WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

314
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,541
IF WE DON'T HURRY,
THE EIZO ARE GONNA BE
ALL OVER US!

315
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,250
- THAT'S JUST IT!

316
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,041
IF YOU STAY HERE WITH ME,
YOU'LL GET CAUGHT UP
IN THE ATTACK!

317
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,791
IF YOU STAY WITH ME, YOU'LL DIE
ALONG WITH ME, RENTON!

318
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,250
I WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN,
NO MATTER WHAT!

319
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,791
NO MATTER WHAT!

320
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,250
- Woz: E-EIZO HALT CONFIRMED!
- Talho: BECAUSE OF THAT LIGHT?

321
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,666
- UNKNOWN!

322
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,000
- MESSAGE FROM
THE FLAGSHIP SHINANO!

323
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,750
AS OF THIS MOMENT,
SOUTH DAKOTA IS ABANDONED!

324
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,666
ALL FORCES,
FALL BACK TO LINE 5-5-7!

325
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,958
- COULD IT BE THE SECRET ITEM
HAS HALTED THE EIZO?

326
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,416
- ( alarm blaring )
- STELLAR WAVE DETECTED!

327
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,541
IT'S BAD!
IT'S A FUSION PHENOMENON!

328
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:10,166
- WHAT ARE THE COORDINATES?
- COORDINATES ARE, 0080 BY 0083!

329
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,291
- OH, NO!

330
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:27,583
- S-SIGNALS OF THE OBJECTIVE
AND NIRVASH, BOTH LOST.

331
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,916
- IT ALL OVER.
- OH, HOLLAND.

332
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,791
- OUR DREAMS...
HELL, OUR WHOLE FUTURE
JUST WENT UP IN SMOKE.

333
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,500
- Renton: EUREKA! EUREKA!

334
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:49,000
PLEASE TALK TO ME,
EUREKA! EUREKA!
PLEASE TALK YOU ME.

335
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:52,791
- I WARNED YOU. AFTER I TRIED
SO HARD TO WARN YOU,

336
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,583
WHY DID YOU GET INVOLVED
IN ALL THIS, RENTON?

337
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,166
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WhAT'RE YOU SAYING?

338
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,250
WHO ELSE IN THIS WORLD IS
GONNA PROTECT YOU EUREKA?

339
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,375
- I DON'T WANT YOU
TO PROTECT ME!

340
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,958
I'M NOT WORTH SAVING!
I DON'T DESERVE IT!

341
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,875
I DON'T DESERVE YOU RISKING
YOUR LIFE PROTECTING ME, RENTON!

342
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,958
- THAT'S NOT YOUR DECISION
TO MAKE!

343
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,166
DON'T DECIDE THAT ON YOUR OWN.

344
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,250
DON'T DECIDE SOMETHING
LIKE THAT YOURSELF!

345
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,708
AFTER YOU WERE TAKEN AWAY,
I SWORE TO MYSELF,

346
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,541
THAT I'D NEVER LET IT
HAPPEN AGAIN!

347
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:25,583
THAT IF I EVER SAW YOU AGAIN,
I'D KEEP YOU SAFE AND SOUND,
NO MATTER WHAT!

348
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:28,583
SO PLEASE, COME WITH ME, EUREKA!

349
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:36,791
- ( sniffles ) RENTON, I...
THE TRUTH IS...

350
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,250
I DON'T WANT
TO LEAVE YOU, EITHER.

351
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,791
I NEED YOU!
I WANT TO STAY WITH YOU--

352
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,958
( screams )

353
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,833
- ( whispers ) EUREKA. EUREKA.

354
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:56,208
EUREKA. EUREKA. EUREKA.

355
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,458
EUREKA.

356
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,916
- RENTON. RENTON.

357
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,541
RENTON. RENTON.
RENTON. RENTON. RENTON!

358
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:24,000
OH. THIS IS THE WORLD
THAT RENTON ALWAYS SAW.

359
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,333
THE WORLD THAT
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE.

360
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:31,000
BUT IT HURTS. IT HURTS.

361
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:35,250
SAVE ME. SAVE ME, RENTON!

362
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,583
- ( Nirvash squeaks )

363
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,250
- NIRVASH, HELP!

364
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:47,291
- EUREKA!
- RENTON! RENTON! AH!

365
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:53,958
- I'VE GOT YOU!
I WON'T LET YOU GO!

366
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:57,333
I WON'T LET YOU GO,
EVER AGAIN, EUREKA!

367
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,541
- YOU IDIOT!
IDIOT, IDIOT, IDIOT!

368
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,041
YOU'RE SUCH AN IDIOT!

369
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,875
( sobs ) YOU'RE A IDIOT.
YOU'RE A BIG IDIOT, RENTON.

370
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,958
YOU DID SOMETHING SO RECKLESS
TO HELP THE LIKES OF ME.

371
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,041
- I CAN'T STAND IT.

372
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,583
I CAN'T STAND EVEN THE THOUGHT
OF BEING APART FROM YOU ANYMORE!

373
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,291
- NEITHER CAN I.

374
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:20,958
I CAN'T STAND IT.
I CAN'T STAND IT EITHER, RENTON.

375
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:30,166
- Gidget: THE GEKKO IS
NOW CROSSING LINE 5-5-7.

376
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,625
NOW EXITING
EIZO'S INTERFERENCE WAVE ZONE.

377
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,125
- WHAT THE HELL?

378
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:36,916
THERE'S A NEW
INTERFERENCE WAVE SOURCE!

379
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,875
- MORE FORCES?
- IT'S SOMETHING ELSE!

380
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,375
- GIVE ME THE LOCATION?
WHERE'S IT COMING FROM?

381
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:45,458
- 0080 BY 0083! RIGHT BELOW
THE SOUTH DAKOTA TOWER!

382
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:48,208
- WAIT, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
- Woz: STELLAR WAVE DETECTED!

383
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:49,541
IT'S NO USE!

384
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:52,125
THE GAIN IS SO HIGH,
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO MEASURE!

385
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:54,291
- IT'S LIKE BEFORE.
- Talho: WHAT IS?

386
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:56,208
- IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME.

387
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,583
IT'S THE SAME
AS THE RAINBOW FROM BEFORE!

388
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:12,708
- Masao: WHAT HAPPENED?
- Mother: I HAVE NO IDEA.

389
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:18,208
BUT IT'S AS IF THE WORLD
IS SINGING A SONG OF JOY
ABOUT SOMETHING.

390
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:22,125
- ( shrieks )

391
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:38,166
- Eureka: AMAZING!
THAT WAS AMAZING, NIRVASH!

392
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,708
- WHAT IS ALL THIS?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

393
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:40,583
- RENTON! LOOK AHEAD!

394
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:43,291
- ( Nirvash squeaks )

395
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,958
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, IT'S OKAY--

396
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:07,625
THE EIZO TURNED INTO CLOUDS.

397
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:11,125
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YES, I'LL BE OKAY. ( groans )

398
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:12,166
- EUREKA!

399
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,166
- Holland: YOU'RE SURE?

400
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,458
- Gidget: YES, SIR!
ITS' THE NIRVASH!

401
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:39,041
I'M ALSO PICKING UP
TWO ADDITIONAL LIFE SIGNS!

402
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:42,833
- SO THEN THAT BIG FLASH OF
LIGHT MUST HAVE BEEN STARDUST.

403
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:45,458
- Woz: THERE'S NOTHING
IN THE DATA TO SUPPORT
THAT CONCLUSION.

404
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:47,083
- I SEE.

405
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:49,958
- STILL IT LOOKS LIKE
IT ALL WORKED OUT.

406
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:52,083
WE GOT OUR HANDS
ON OUR KEY OBJECTIVE, RIGHT?

407
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:54,083
- RIGHT.

408
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:58,416
THAT'S THE LINCHPIN TO OUR
ACTUAL OBJECTIVE, THE MYTH
REGENERATION PROJECT.

409
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,750
IT HAS TO BE
THE " WHITE SACRED ONE."

410
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:08,875
- EUREKA, PLEASE,
TRY TO HANG ON!

411
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:10,875
- I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

412
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:14,041
NEXT TO THE EXPERIMENTS
THE MILITARY PUT ME THROUGH,
THIS IS NOTHING.

413
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:17,041
- ( Nirvash squeaks )

414
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:19,250
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT WILL BE OVER SOON?

415
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,708
- ( Nirvash squeaks )
- SEND THEM AWAY?

416
00:25:21,791 --> 00:25:23,166
- WHAT'S HE SAYING?

417
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,875
- NIRVASH SAYS THAT
HE'S GONNA... ( screams )

418
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,250
...SEND THE EIZO AWAY FOR US!

419
00:25:56,958 --> 00:25:59,000
- ( rumbling )

420
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:14,333
- Holland: RENTON, YOU OKAY?

421
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,500
- COMMANDER.

422
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:19,875
- THAT WAS A LITTLE TOO MUCH
GRANDSTANDING.

423
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:22,333
BUT FOR YOUR FIRST MISSION,
YOU FOUGHT HARD.

424
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:25,333
AND YOU EVEN SUCCESSFULLY
RETRIEVED THE SECRET ITEM.

425
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,541
YOU DID GOOD.

426
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:31,083
- YOU MEAN
THE SECRET ITEM IS HER?

427
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:33,875
- THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT GIRL IS EUREKA.

428
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:36,333
THE MILITARY'S MOST GUARDED
AND PRECIOUS SECRET.

429
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:42,166
- COMMANDER, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT ALL THIS MEANS.

430
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,208
- Koda: THOSE ARE
THE BASIC FACTS OF THE CASE.

431
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:51,791
THE ONE ITEM THAT I FIND
TROUBLING IS THE SYRINGE


432
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:56,041
CONTAINING THE DRUG CALLED
"DATU-RA" THAT WAS LEFT
AT THE SCENE.


433
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:58,083
- I AM UNFAMILIAR WITH THAT.


434
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:01,583
- IT'S ADMINISTERED
TO SURVIVORS OF
THE TRAGEDY OF DOHA.


435
00:27:01,666 --> 00:27:03,250
OF COURSE, CONSIDERING THAT


436
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:05,958
THE VICTIM WAS
MAJOR GENERAL DEWEY SORENSTAM,


437
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,666
A MAN WHO EARNED HIS FAME
AT THE TRAGEDY OF DOHA,

438
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:13,000
THE FACT THAT IT WAS FOUND
AT THE CRIME SCENE
IS HARDLY SURPRISING.

439
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:18,791
THIS CONCLUDES MY REPORT.
IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME.

440
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:21,333
- A MOMENT, PLEASE,
COMRADE KODA.

441
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:23,250
- YES, WHAT IS IT?

442
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:26,458
- FORGIVE ME, BUT MIGHT I
TROUBLE YOU TO STAY WITH US
FOR ONE MORE WEEK?

443
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:30,875
- THE WEEK PRIOR
TO ONE'S RETIREMENT

444
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:33,708
IS TO BE SPENT
HOWEVER ONE SEES FIT.

445
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:37,166
SURELY YOU KNOW
THIS IS GUARANTEED BY LAW.

446
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:41,458
- WE ARE ABOUT TO ENTER
THE CRITICAL FINAL STAGE
OF THE HAMMER OF GOD PROJECT,

447
00:27:41,541 --> 00:27:45,875
SO WE CAN'T SPARE ANY PERSONNEL
ON THIS DEWEY SORENSTAM MURDER,
YOU SEE.

448
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:49,458
- Kuzemi: AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT,
YOU HAVE A BACKGROUND
IN PUBLIC SECURITY

449
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:53,041
- AND HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO.
- IS THIS AN ORDER?

450
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:56,916
- AS I RECALL, YOU WERE
HOPING FOR A BERTH
ON THE ESCAPE SHIP,


451
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,333
OR AM I MISTAKEN?


452
00:28:01,791 --> 00:28:03,791
- Talho: LOOKS LIKE
WE'VE GIVEN THEM THE SLIP.

453
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:05,000
- Holland: YEAH.

454
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,833
WE'LL PROBABLY BE
SPOTTED SOON,

455
00:28:06,916 --> 00:28:09,375
BUT NO ONE CAN CATCH UP
TO US NOW.

456
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:11,916
ALL THAT'S LEFT TO DO
IS GET THE STARDUST.

457
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,125
WHEN WE DO
ALL OF OUR DREAMS,

458
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,625
YOUR DREAM AND MINE
WILL COME TRUE.

459
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:19,708
THEN YOU WON'T HAVE TO
SUFFER ANYMORE.

460
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,083
- IT WON'T BE LONG, WILL IT?

461
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:25,250
- NOT LONG AT ALL.

462
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:29,083
OUR FUTURE IS ALMOST
CLOSE ENOUGH TO TOUCH.

463
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:33,291
- "CLAD IN STARDUST,
THE WHITE SACRED ONE WILL
ERECT A RAINBOW BRIDGE

464
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:35,416
"TO THE STARS
WITH THE WANING MOON.

465
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,916
"AND THE CHOSEN MAIDEN

466
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,041
"AND BOY WILL RETURN
TO THE BLUE ORB

467
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:44,041
"WHICH WAS BORN
FROM THE EARTH."

468
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,291
- RENTON...

469
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:55,375
- UH, UM...

470
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:59,375
THE DOCTOR SAID I COULD
HAVE FIVE MINUTES. SO, I, UH...

471
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:03,458
- YOU'VE GROWN A LOT, RENTON.

472
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:09,708
- YOU, TOO, EUREKA.
YOU'RE PRETTY.

473
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,208
- IT'S THE SAME.
- WHAT IS?

474
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:18,291
- THIS IS JUST LIKE
WHEN WE FIRST MET.

475
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:20,791
- UM, IF YOU SAY SO.

476
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:24,083
- JUST LIKE NOW,
I WAS LYING ASLEEP IN MY BED,

477
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:28,166
AND WHEN I WOKE UP,
THERE YOU WERE,
JUST WATCHING ME.

478
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,291
- IT WAS NIRVASH.

479
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:32,958
THAT DAY
NIRVASH HAD DISAPPEARED.

480
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:37,625
I'D LOOKED FOR HIM
ALL OVER THE HOSPITAL,

481
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:41,250
AND THEN SUDDENLY I HEARD
HIS VOICE COMING FROM YOUR ROOM.

482
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:44,000
I WENT INSIDE
AND THERE YOU WERE.

483
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:47,125
- YOU SAID SOMETHING TO ME
WHEN YOU SAW ME THAT DAY.

484
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:48,666
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS?

485
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,166
- SORRY, I DON'T.
- YOU SAID I WAS PRETTY.

486
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:59,625
YOU LOOKED AT ME, AND THEN
YOU TOLD ME THAT I WAS PRETTY.

487
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:05,500
- Jurgens: ( laughs )
WHAT A LOUSY PIECE OF LUCK!

488
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:07,750
- Koda: THIS IS
NO LAUGHING MATTER.

489
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:12,208
SO, THE PUBLIC SECURITY DIRECTOR
HAS PICKED ME UP
IN HIS PERSONAL CAR.

490
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:15,291
I ASSUME THAT THERE HAVE BEEN
DEVELOPMENTS, JURGENS?

491
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:18,000
- THE LATE MAJ. GEN. SORENSTAM.

492
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:21,583
ARREST WARRANTS HAVE BEEN
ISSUED FOR THE SOLDIERS
WHO SERVED UNDER HIM.

493
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:25,125
- ARREST WARRANTS?
SUSPICION OF ASSASSINATION?

494
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:27,541
- NO, MA'AM.
SUSPICION OF ABDUCTING MINORS.

495
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:30,166
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

496
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:33,958
- HAVE YOU HEARD THAT
MAJ. GEN. SORENSTAM
TOOK IN WAR ORPHANS?

497
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,916
- ONLY RUMORS.

498
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,833
- WELL, APPARENTLY,
ALL OF THOSE ORPHANS
HAVE BEEN MISSING

499
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:41,291
SINCE JUST AFTER THE MURDER.

500
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:46,291
WERE YOU AWARE THAT
THE MAJ. GENERAL HAD
SOME "UNUSUAL" INTERESTS?

501
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:49,000
- UNUSUAL INTERESTS?

502
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:51,541
- HE WAS APPARENTLY UNINTERESTED
IN ADULT BODIES.

503
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,916
GIVEN THE CURRENT
STATE OF AFFAIRS,

504
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,791
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NO TROUBLE
AT ALL TO COLLECT CHILDREN.

505
00:30:57,875 --> 00:31:01,250
- HE DID THIS TO WAR ORPHANS?
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

506
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:04,416
- IT'S POSSIBLE THIS WAS
THE REASON HE WAS THE FIRST
TO RUSH TO THE SCENE

507
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,208
AT THE TIME OF
THE TRAGEDY OF DOHA.

508
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:10,375
YOU SHOULD NEVER LOOK
TOO CLOSELY AT HEROES.

509
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:13,583
- SO, HIS FELLOW SOLDIERS
COULDN'T TURN A BLIND EYE
TO HIS BEHAVIOR,

510
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:16,458
ASSASSINATED HIM AND
THEN TOOK THE CHILDREN.

511
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,250
- THAT SEEMS TO FIT
THE EVIDENCE WE'VE COLLECTED.

512
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:21,541
- THIS WOULD BE A MAJOR SCANDAL.

513
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:24,291
I DON'T BLAME THE ARMY
FOR KEEPING THIS QUIET.

514
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:26,791
DO YOU HAVE ANY
LIKELY SUSPECTS?

515
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,708
- WE'RE USING ALL OUR RESOURCES
TO TRACK DOWN THIS MAN,

516
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:33,083
A FORMER SUBORDINATE OF THE
GENERAL'S, AND HIS ASSOCIATES.

517
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:35,541
THE MAN'S NAME
IS HOLLAND NOVAK.

518
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:37,958
- HOLLAND NOVAK.
- ( phone rings )

519
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:39,291
- EXCUSE ME.

520
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:41,208
- REALLY? THIS IS WHO
HE'S LOOKING FOR?

521
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:44,708
- IT'S ME. WHAT?
- HE HARDLY STRIKES ME
AS THE TYPE.

522
00:31:44,791 --> 00:31:47,708
- I UNDERSTAND. I'LL MAKE
THE ARRANGEMENTS IMMEDIATELY.

523
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:51,125
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- A CLASS-1 INVESTIGATION ORDER.

524
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:54,250
IT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT THE UNIT
THAT RECOVERED THE SECRET ITEM,

525
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:58,625
THE 303RD REGIMENT,
WENT MISSING WITH THE ITEM
RIGHT AFTER THE OPERATION.

526
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,041
- WENT MISSING?

527
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:04,666
- Renton: WHEN THIS OPERATION IS
OVER, I CAN MAKE 2ND LIEUTENANT.

528
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:08,541
AND WHEN YOU MAKE
2ND LIEUTENANT, YOU CAN CHOOSE
WHERE YOU GET STATIONED.

529
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:13,250
SO I'VE DECIDED THAT
I'M GONNA ASK TO BE STATIONED
AT THE WARSAWA GARRISON.

530
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:17,583
UM, IF I GET APPROVAL,
LET'S GO BACK TOGETHER, EUREKA.

531
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:21,250
LET'S LIVE IN WARSAWA

532
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:24,208
AND WE'LL WATCH OVER
THAT HILL TOGETHER.

533
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:26,000
- IDIOT.

534
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:29,625
- IDIOT? HOW CAN YOU
CALL ME AN IDIOT?

535
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:31,958
WE PROMISED THE PROFESSOR
WE'D DO IT, REMEMBER?

536
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:35,541
- I WANT TO KEEP OUR PROMISE
TO THE PROFESSOR, TOO, RENTON.

537
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:37,875
BUT CAN'T YOU SEE
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE NOW.

538
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:39,833
FOR ONE THING, I'M NOT HUMAN.

539
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,583
- SO WHAT IF YOU'RE NOT?

540
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:43,875
IT NEVER MADE
A DIFFERENCE BEFORE!

541
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:47,625
MY MOM, MY DAD,
EVEN PROFESSOR DOMINIC,

542
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:50,416
THEY ALL CARED FOR YOU
JUST AS MUCH AS THEY DID FOR ME!

543
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,833
- YOU KNOW YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S EVER SAID THINGS LIKE
THAT TO ME.

544
00:32:56,458 --> 00:33:00,708
TELL ME, RENTON, DO YOU KNOW
WHY THEY CALL ME
THE MILITARY'S TOP SECRET?

545
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:02,416
- I DON'T KNOW.

546
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,500
THE COMMANDER WON'T TELL ME,
AND NEITHER WILL ANYBODY ELSE.

547
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,000
- IT'S BECAUSE I'M ACTUALLY
A SPY ROBOT THAT THE EIZO BUILT

548
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:11,166
AND SENT HERE YEARS AGO.

549
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:15,458
A ROBOT MADE BY THE EIZO
IN ORDER TO GATHER AND STORE
INFORMATION ON HUMANITY.

550
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,250
THAT'S WHAT I AM.

551
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:20,416
- I WISH YOU WOULDN'T
KID AROUND LIKE THAT.

552
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,375
- YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?

553
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:25,333
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

554
00:33:25,416 --> 00:33:28,625
WHENEVER I'M AROUND YOU
ALL I WANT TO BE IS
AN ORDINARY GIRL, RENTON.

555
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:31,666
ANYWAY...

556
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,041
- Renton: EUREKA STARTED
TELLING ME ABOUT HERSELF.

557
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:37,416
IT WAS AS IF SHE WAS
DELIRIOUS FROM A FEVER.

558
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,083
SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS SUBJECTED
TO HORRIBLE EXPERIMENTS
BY THE MILITARY,

559
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:44,000
AND THAT SHE TRIED TO DIE
COUNTLESS TIMES.

560
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:47,041
BUT EACH TIME, SHE'D LOOK AT HER
PENDANT, AND THAT STOPPED HER.

561
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:50,416
THEN THE MILITARY SCIENTISTS
TOLD HER

562
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,916
THAT HER BODY'S FUNCTIONS
WOULD SOON CEASE COMPLETELY.

563
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,583
IN OTHER WORDS, NO MATTER
WHAT SHE OR ANYONE ELSE DID,

564
00:33:57,666 --> 00:33:59,583
SHE WAS GOING TO DIE.

565
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:01,125
THEY TOLD HER THAT
WHEN THE RED LINES

566
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:03,458
THAT WERE SET INSIDE IN
HER LAVENDER EYES DISAPPEARED,

567
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,666
THAT'S WHEN HER LIFE
WOULD BE OVER.

568
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:10,958
EUREKA SAID SHE DIDN'T MIND
IF I DIDN'T BELIEVE HER.

569
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,916
BUT I... I...

570
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:16,750
I'VE GOT TO HURRY.

571
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:20,333
IF I'M GONNA TAKE EUREKA
BACK WITH ME TO WARSAWA,

572
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:21,708
THERE'S REALLY NOT MUCH TIME.

573
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:25,083
SO YOU'LL HELP ME OUT,
RIGHT, NIRVASH?

574
00:34:28,958 --> 00:34:30,958
WHY AREN'T YOU SAYING ANYTHING?

575
00:34:32,291 --> 00:34:33,750
YOU SURE ARE FICKLE.

576
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:41,166
- Maria: PLEASE, MA'AM,
DON'T TAKE IT SO HARD.

577
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,458
THE FACT THAT THE CULPRIT
THAT WAS BEHIND THE KILLING

578
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:45,458
OF MAJ. GEN. SORENSTAM

579
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:48,500
WAS THE LEADER OF
THE MISSING 303RD REGIMENT

580
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:49,875
WAS NOT OUR FAULT.

581
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:52,208
- THERE'S ONE THING
THAT STILL BOTHERS ME.

582
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:54,250
- WHAT'S THAT, MA'AM?

583
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:59,416
- WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE A SYRINGE
CONTAINING DATU-RA WAS LEFT
AT THE MURDER SCENE?

584
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,416
THE ONLY PEOPLE THERE WERE
THE GENERAL AND HOLLAND NOVAK,

585
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,458
A LOW-RANKING SOLDIER.

586
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:07,416
- DO YOU BELIEVE THAT
SOMEONE ELSE WAS
IN THE ROOM, MA'AM?

587
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,250
- MARIA, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT SORT OF EFFECT

588
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:15,500
THE DRUG MM-88, COMMONLY KNOWN
AS DATU-RA, HAS ON THE BODY?

589
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:18,708
- NO, MA'AM, I DON'T.
- IT IS A GROWTH INHIBITOR.

590
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:22,041
THE DRUG IS A GROWTH INHIBITOR.

591
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:25,708
SOME WOULD CALL IT
AN IMMORTALITY ELIXIR.

592
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:28,833
OF COURSE, ITS EFFECTS
ONLY LAST FOR SEVEN DAYS.

593
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:31,750
MANY WOULD SEE THE DRUG
AS SOMEWHAT POINTLESS.

594
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:35,583
BUT, MA'AM, WHY WOULD
THE MAJ. GENERAL HAVE
SUCH A USELESS DRUG?

595
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:39,666
WELL, IT'S NOT AS IF THAT MAN
HAD ANY PARTICULAR NEED FOR IT.

596
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,666
I BELIEVE THE ONE
WHO NEEDED IT WAS--

597
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,583
- PLEASE PARDON
THE INTRUSION, MA'AM.

598
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:47,291
- THIS IS MINISTER KODA'S
PRIVATE RESIDENCE!
HOW DARE YOU BARGE IN!

599
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:48,833
- THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.

600
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:51,208
HOLLAND NOVAK
HAS BEEN LOCATED.

601
00:35:51,291 --> 00:35:55,083
- WELL, THAT WAS FAIRLY SIMPLE.
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!

602
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:58,250
WHAT THEY ACTUALLY FOUND IS
HOLLAND NOVAK'S LIFELESS CORPSE!

603
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:01,666
- WAIT A MINUTE. IF HE'S DEAD,

604
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,750
THEN WHO IN BLAZES IS
THE LEADING THE 303RD REGIMENT?

605
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:08,708
- Soldier: ATTENTION GEKKO,

606
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:12,625
THIS IS THE LIBERATION ARMY
EASTERN FRONT
277TH MOBILE DIVISION.

607
00:36:12,708 --> 00:36:15,833
HEAVE TO AND SUBMIT TO
A SPOT INSPECTION IMMEDIATELY.

608
00:36:15,916 --> 00:36:17,333
I'LL SAY AGAIN. THIS IS
THE LIBERATION ARMY...

609
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:21,541
- EVERYONE DONE SHOOTING UP?
- Talho: YOU'RE THE LAST, 350Z.

610
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:23,875
EVERYONE ON BOARD HAS FINISHED
TAKING THEIR SHOT.

611
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:28,291
- 350Z, THAT REALLY
TAKES ME BACK.

612
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:30,583
BUT YOU KNOW DAMN WELL
THAT'S NOT MY REAL NAME.

613
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,458
WE HAD OUR NAMES AND OUR FUTURE
STOLEN FROM US.

614
00:36:35,916 --> 00:36:37,750
BUT WE'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE
BOTH OF THEM BACK SOON.

615
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:40,333
THROUGH OUR OWN ACTIONS.

616
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:43,958
- I KNOW WE WILL.

617
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:47,833
ALL HANDS, PREPARE FOR ATTACK!
SWITCH IKF TO PHASE AGEHA!

618
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:48,875
- All: AYE-AYE!

619
00:36:56,458 --> 00:36:58,041
- ( distant explosion )
- AN ATTACK?

620
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:01,291
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

621
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:03,541
I DIDN'T HEAR ANY ORDER
TO SCRAMBLE.

622
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:05,875
AND THIS IKF PHASE, IT'S--

623
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,916
WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON, HERE?

624
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:15,208
THAT'S A LIBERATION
ARMY BATTLESHIP!

625
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:28,541
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.
WHY ARE WE
FIGHTING OUR ALLIES?

626
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:32,958
COMMANDER?
DO YOU READ ME, COMMANDER?

627
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:36,291
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WHY ARE WE FIGHTING
AGAINST THEM?

628
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:39,833
- NOBODY TOLD YOU
TO COME OUT HERE!

629
00:37:39,916 --> 00:37:42,208
NOBODY GAVE YOU ORDERS
TO GO INTO BATTLE!

630
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:45,791
- BUT, MATTHIEU,
WHY'S THE COMMANDER FIGHTING
AGAINST THIS ARMY UNIT?

631
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:48,291
ARE THOSE GUYS SOME KIND OF
A REBEL SQUADRON OR SOMETHING?

632
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:50,125
- NO, THEY AIN'T!

633
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:53,083
SORRY, RENTON,
BUT WE'RE THE ONLY REBELS HERE.

634
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:01,875
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON! NIRVASH!

635
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:04,875
- ( powering down sound )
- HE HIT THE KILL SWITCH?

636
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:08,791
COMMANDER HOLLAND,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

637
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:10,916
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
PLEASE, STOP!

638
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,333
THEY'RE HUMANS, JUST LIKE US!

639
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,625
- THAT'D BE TRUE,

640
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:17,208
IF WE WERE EVEN CLOSE
TO BEING NORMAL HUMANS.

641
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:20,541
IF WE WERE STILL NORMAL HUMANS,

642
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:25,041
WE WOULDN'T BE DOING THIS!

643
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:27,625
- WAIT, COMMANDER! COMMANDER!

644
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:31,291
COMMANDER! COMMANDER!
COMMANDER! COMMANDER!

645
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,583
- Koda: THEIR PLAN THUS FAR
WAS SHEER GENIUS.

646
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:43,041
THE LEADER ASSASSINATED
MAJ. GEN. DEWEY SORENSTAM,

647
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:46,166
THEN MURDERED THEIR GUARDIAN,
HOLLAND NOVAK.

648
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:50,083
THEN HE POSED AS NOVAK
AND INFILTRATED THE ARMY
AS A MERCENARY,

649
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:52,750
AND THEN, AFTER STEALING
THE TOP SECRET ITEM,

650
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:56,708
HE USED THE CONFUSION OF
THAT UNKNOWN EIZO PHENOMENON
TO COVER HIS TRACKS.

651
00:38:59,166 --> 00:39:02,666
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THEIR OBJECTIVE IS.

652
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,666
BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW
AT THE VERY LEAST

653
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:07,208
IS THAT THIS INCIDENT
IS THE WORK OF THE CHILDREN

654
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:09,041
WHO SURVIVED
THE TRAGEDY OF DOHA.

655
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:13,250
- BUT THAT LEAVES
JUST ONE ODD POINT.

656
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:16,083
NOT ALL MEMBERS
OF THE 303RD REGIMENT

657
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:19,041
ARE SURVIVORS OF
THE TRAGEDY OF DOHA.

658
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:22,375
- SOME AREN'T?
- YES. JUST ONE, MA'AM.

659
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:25,916
THIS ONE YOUNG SOLDIER,
BY THE NAME OF RENTON THURSTON,

660
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,625
- DOESN'T MATCH OUR DATABASE.
- RENTON THURSTON?

661
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:35,291
- Jurgens: CORPORAL
RENTON THURSTON, AGE, 14,
BORN IN WARSAWA.


662
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:38,458
PARENTS WERE THE MASTERMINDS
BEHIND THE TRAGEDY OF DOHA.

663
00:39:38,541 --> 00:39:39,625
BOTH PARENTS ARE DECEASED.


664
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,791
AFTER HIS FATHER
DIED IN COMBAT,


665
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:45,708
HE ENROLLED IN THE PLA
CHILDREN'S SCHOOL IN TOKYO.


666
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:49,208
ALTHOUGH SUBJECTED
TO SEVERE ABUSE AS
THE CHILD OF CULTISTS,

667
00:39:49,291 --> 00:39:51,041
HE EXHIBITED SUPERIOR SKILLS
AS A MECH PILOT.

668
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:52,375
- ( glass shatters )

669
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,000
- ( squeaks angrily )

670
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:03,750
- IT IS WIDELY BELIEVED THAT
THIS SKILL WAS THE RESULT OF

671
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:07,041
HIS INNATE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE
A RAPPORT WITH A KLF LARVA

672
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:09,000
THAT HE GREW UP WITH
NAMED NIRVASH.

673
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:16,916
IN FACT NIRVASH'S UNPARALLELED
RAPID GROWTH IS CONSIDERED
PROOF OF THOSE ABILITIES.

674
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,916
ONCE IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT
HE'D DESTROYED THREE TOP DOGS
IN A MOCK COMBAT DRILL

675
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,541
AFTER BEING RE-OUTFITTED
AS A KLF,

676
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:26,375
A REQUEST CAME DOWN
IN DECEMBER OF 2054

677
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:30,000
FROM THE PLA 1ST MOBILE DIVISION
ASKING THAT HE BE ALLOWED IN

678
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:32,750
AS A SPECIAL EXCEPTION,
AND WAS ACCEPTED.

679
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:35,625
- YOU'LL GIVE ME A PROMOTION
TO 2ND LIEUTENANT, RIGHT?

680
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:37,833
- Jurgens: THAT SAME MONTH,
HE WAS ASSIGNED TO

681
00:40:37,916 --> 00:40:41,125
THE LIBERATION ARMY
1ST DIVISION, 303RD REGIMENT.

682
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:45,208
AND EVER SINCE THE ENGAGEMENT
WITH THE EIZO IN SOUTH DAKOTA
LAST MONTH,

683
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:47,583
HE HAS BEEN IN HIDING
ALONG WITH HIS TEAM,

684
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:50,250
- ( beeping )

685
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:54,416
- HE'S GONE THROUGH SO MUCH,
AND HE'S ONLY 14. IT'S CRUEL.

686
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:58,166
- A BOY WHO HAS A GRUDGE
AGAINST SOCIETY, HMM?

687
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,375
- YOU BELIEVE HE'S A MEMBER
OF THE REBELS, THEN?

688
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,166
- NOT ONLY THAT,
BUT A KEY FIGURE.

689
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,291
PERHAPS WE SHOULD
INVESTIGATE THIS FURTHER.

690
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:08,708
- Sonia: THANK YOU FOR WAITING.

691
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:11,458
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND
FOLLOWING ME, PLEASE.
RIGHT THIS WAY.

692
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:15,125
- Holland: IS EVERYTHING READY?

693
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:17,666
- Talho: ALL PARTICIPATING
MEMBERS ARE SYNCHED.

694
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,208
- Hap: DO WE RECORD THIS?

695
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:21,916
- Holland: NAH, I DON'T SEE
ANY NEED TO. LET'S START.

696
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:25,833
LIFT YOUR HEAD.

697
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:28,083
DON'T WANT TO LOOK
A TRAITOR IN THE FACE?

698
00:41:29,416 --> 00:41:31,291
- SO, YOU WERE ALL IN ON THIS.

699
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:34,541
- THAT'S RIGHT.
SORRY, WE DECEIVED YOU.

700
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,083
- WHAT ARE YOU AFTER?

701
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:39,000
WHAT'S YOUR REASON FOR
TRICKING ME, STEALING EUREKA,

702
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:41,416
AND TURNING INTO
A BUNCH OF REBELS?

703
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,375
- BEFORE I ANSWER THAT,
THERE'S ONE THING THAT
I WANT TO ASK YOU.

704
00:41:45,458 --> 00:41:48,125
EXACTLY HOW OLD
DO I LOOK TO YOU?

705
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:50,416
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- ANSWER THE QUESTION.

706
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,958
- HOW THE HELL SHOULD I KNOW?

707
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:54,416
- I'M 17.
- HUH?

708
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,291
- AND NOT JUST ME.
EVERYONE HERE,

709
00:41:57,375 --> 00:42:01,166
EVERY MEMBER OF
THE 303RD REGIMENT IS 17.

710
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:06,375
- Morita: HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF THE CHILDREN OF NEVERLAND?

711
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:09,166
- Koda: YOU'RE NOT REFERRING
TO PETER PAN, I TAKE IT?

712
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,791
- THE TRAGEDY OF DOHA
EIGHT YEARS AGO.

713
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:15,916
THE BOYS AND GIRLS OF
UNKNOWN ORIGIN WHO WERE FOUND
AT THE HEART OF THE EXPLOSION.

714
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,916
THAT IS THE NAME THAT
THEY GAVE TO THEMSELVES.

715
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,916
- I WAS GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND
THAT THIS PLACE IS THE REASON

716
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,291
THOSE "ETERNAL CHILDREN"
APPEARED.

717
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:28,375
- THE PEOPLE HERE AT
THE OLD WARSAWA LABS

718
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:31,708
WERE CONDUCTING RESEARCH
INTO ANTI-EIZO WEAPONRY.

719
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:35,791
THIS IS ALSO THE BIRTHPLACE
OF THE KLFS THAT WE DEPEND ON.

720
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:39,083
- SO YOU ARE SAYING
THAT "WISDOM" BEYOND
HUMAN UNDERSTANDING

721
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:41,833
- WAS COLLECTED HERE?
- YES, MA'AM.

722
00:42:41,916 --> 00:42:44,458
AND THE SOURCE OF ALL THAT
"WISDOM" WERE THE HUMANOIDS

723
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:47,333
THAT WERE FOUND EVERY SO OFTEN
ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

724
00:42:47,416 --> 00:42:50,583
THESE ARE THE GIRLS
THAT WE REFER TO AS
OUR TOP SECRET ITEMS.

725
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:54,750
- OH, THE GIRLS? PLURAL?

726
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:57,750
- YES, MA'AM. THERE HAVE BEEN
SEVEN THAT WE KNOW OF.

727
00:42:57,833 --> 00:42:59,541
THE GIRLS WERE ALL
BRUTALLY TORTURED

728
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:03,708
TO TRY TO GLEAN
ALL INFORMATION POSSIBLE
FROM THEM ABOUT THE EIZO.

729
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:07,958
- AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME,
THE PEOPLE HERE GRADUALLY
DEVELOPED INTO A CULT.

730
00:43:08,791 --> 00:43:10,375
WHAT DID THEY UNCOVER?

731
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:13,916
- I DON'T KNOW.
ALL RECORDS WERE BURNED

732
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,666
BECAUSE THE LOCAL RESIDENTS
WERE ENRAGED BY WHAT WAS
HAPPENING HERE.

733
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:18,416
- I SEE.

734
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,708
- HOWEVER, BASED ON
THE FEW THAT REMAIN,

735
00:43:21,791 --> 00:43:24,125
WE KNOW THAT THEY CONDUCTED
VARIOUS EXPERIMENTS

736
00:43:24,208 --> 00:43:26,708
ON 40 WAR ORPHANS
AND ONE OF THE GIRLS,

737
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:29,791
WITH AN EYE ON CARRYING OUT SOME
SORT OF CLANDESTINE PROJECT.

738
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,625
WE'VE MANAGED
TO IDENTIFY THE GIRL.

739
00:43:33,708 --> 00:43:36,958
SUBJECT 006, CODE NAME ANEMONE.

740
00:43:38,291 --> 00:43:40,583
- Holland: BY THE TIME
WE FIGURED IT OUT,


741
00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:42,250
IT WAS TOO LATE.


742
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:46,583
THE SHIP WE WERE ON WAS ON
A DIRECT COURSE FOR THE EIZO.


743
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:52,000
THE ONLY ADULTS ON BOARD
WERE A YOUNG SOLDIER AND
A PINK-HAIRED WOMAN.

744
00:43:52,083 --> 00:43:54,583
THEY JUST STOOD THERE
HOLDING EACH OTHER,

745
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:56,625
AS IF THEY KNEW
SOMETHING WAS COMING.

746
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:01,166
THEN EVERYTHING AROUND US
STARTED GLOWING.

747
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,916
THE NEXT THING WE KNEW,

748
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,208
WE WERE BEING THROWN OUT
OF THE DISINTEGRATING SHIP.

749
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:09,333
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE.

750
00:44:10,708 --> 00:44:13,250
INSIDE THE STRANGE
RAINBOW COLORED TUNNEL,

751
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:16,000
OUR BODIES BEGAN
TO DISINTEGRATE.

752
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:21,000
AND THEN IT HIT ME.
WE'D BEEN USED AS GUINEA PIGS.

753
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:25,500
NO ONE WOULD SHED A TEAR
OVER THE LOSS OF
A BUNCH OF MISFIT ORPHANS.

754
00:44:25,583 --> 00:44:28,375
I BET THAT'S WHAT
THE ADULTS WERE THINKING.

755
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:31,666
BUT THEN WE SAW SOMETHING
WHEN WE CAME OUT
THE OTHER END OF THE TUNNEL.

756
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,541
A WORLD SPREAD OUT BEFORE US.

757
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:38,416
A BLUE WORLD ENCIRCLED
WITH A RING OF GREEN,

758
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,875
WITH AN ENGRAVED MOON
FLOATING OVER IT.

759
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:45,333
THAT'S WHEN WE KNEW.

760
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:48,958
THAT WAS THE WORLD
THAT WE TRULY BELONGED IN.

761
00:44:51,041 --> 00:44:54,625
SO IN THAT REGARD, WE OWE A DEBT
OF GRATITUDE TO YOUR PARENTS.

762
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:57,541
- WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

763
00:44:57,625 --> 00:45:00,458
- THE EXPERIMENT WE WERE
FORCED TO PARTICIPATE IN,

764
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:02,583
CAME TO BE CALLED
THE TRAGEDY OF DOHA.

765
00:45:04,708 --> 00:45:07,208
- ACCORDING TO THE PEOPLE'S
SCIENCE INSTITUTE,

766
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:10,708
THE SUPER-GRAVITON COLLAPSE
THAT OCCURRED DURING
THE TRAGEDY OF DOHA

767
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,333
TRIGGERED THE FORMATION
OF A BLACK HOLE ON EARTH

768
00:45:13,416 --> 00:45:15,333
THAT LASTED FOR SEVERAL SECONDS.

769
00:45:15,416 --> 00:45:19,458
BUT, WELL, THERE'S QUITE
AN INTERESTING STORY THERE.

770
00:45:19,541 --> 00:45:22,000
THERE'S A THEORY THAT
THIS SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGH

771
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:26,041
MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE RESULT OF
THE WARSAWA CULT GROUP
DECIPHERING A CERTAIN STORY.

772
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,625
- A STORY?
- YES, MA'AM.

773
00:45:29,708 --> 00:45:32,291
AND THE NAME OF THE STORY
THEY ALLEGEDLY DECIPHERED

774
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:33,333
IS THE MYTH OF AGEHA.

775
00:45:35,708 --> 00:45:40,208
- Holland: WHEN WE CAME TO,
WE'D BEEN PULLED BACK
INTO THIS WORLD.

776
00:45:40,291 --> 00:45:44,458
THE SOLDIER WHO WAS
WITH THE PINK-HAIRED WOMAN
WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.

777
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:47,291
THE MILITARY PERSONNEL
WHO RETRIEVED US

778
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:49,125
DISCOVERED THAT
EVERY ONE OF US WAS AGING

779
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:51,916
AT NEARLY THREE TIMES
THE NORMAL RATE OF SPEED.

780
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,250
AS LONG AS WE STAY HERE
IN THIS WORLD,

781
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:59,083
ALL THAT'S WAITING FOR US
IS DEATH.

782
00:45:59,166 --> 00:46:01,208
BUT I SAY SCREW THAT.

783
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:04,666
WE'VE BEEN SCREWED OVER BY FATE,
OUR BODIES HAVE BEEN SHATTERED,

784
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:07,333
AND EVEN OUR FUTURES
HAVE BEEN STOLEN FROM US.

785
00:46:07,416 --> 00:46:09,750
I SAY SCREW THAT!

786
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:13,416
THERE'S NO WAY THAT I AM
GOING TO ACCEPT ANY OF IT!

787
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:17,708
- YEAH? SO WHAT?
- HUH?

788
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:21,000
NONE OF THAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT
TO GO AROUND KILLING PEOPLE!

789
00:46:22,208 --> 00:46:24,375
YOU'RE ALL NOTHING BUT SCUM.

790
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:26,958
YOU'RE A BUNCH OF
MURDERING BASTARDS!

791
00:46:27,791 --> 00:46:29,083
( grunts )

792
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:31,666
- Holland: GET THIS STRAIGHT.

793
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:34,250
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO
FROM NOW ON,

794
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,958
AS FAR AS THE WORLD'S CONCERNED,

795
00:46:36,041 --> 00:46:38,208
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE
A MEMBER OF A REBEL CREW!

796
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:46,041
- Yamashita: YOU KNOW
THAT ALL MATTER THAT
EXISTS IN THIS WORLD,

797
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:49,666
US HUMANS INCLUDED,
IS COMPRISED OF ATOMS, RIGHT?

798
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:54,250
THOSE ATOMS IN TURN ARE COMPOSED
OF TINY SUB ATOMIC PARTICLES.

799
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:59,625
THE SMALLEST PARTICLES
WE'VE PROVEN SO FAR ARE
CALLED ELEMENTARY PARTICLES.

800
00:46:59,708 --> 00:47:02,291
HOWEVER, INSTEAD OF BEING
IN A FIXED STATE,

801
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:05,250
THESE PARTICLES
CONSTANTLY EBB AND FLOW.


802
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:08,250
- Koda: YOU MEAN LIKE WAVES?
- YES.


803
00:47:08,333 --> 00:47:11,666
THIS MEANS THAT IF ONE COULD
LEARN TO CONTROL THESE WAVES,


804
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:16,208
THEN IT WOULD BE THEORETICALLY
POSSIBLE TO REMAKE THE WORLD
AS ONE SAW FIT.


805
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:20,708
IT WAS THE TRAGEDY OF DOHA
EIGHT YEARS AGO THAT
SUBSTANTIATED THIS THEORY.


806
00:47:20,791 --> 00:47:22,750
THE PIONS DETECTED
DURING THE EVENT


807
00:47:22,833 --> 00:47:25,208
SHOULD HAVE EXHIBITED
RANDOM MOVEMENT,

808
00:47:25,291 --> 00:47:27,958
BUT THEIR MOVEMENT ACTUALLY
BORE A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE

809
00:47:28,041 --> 00:47:29,458
TO A CERTAIN PATTERN.

810
00:47:29,541 --> 00:47:32,833
WHEN MOST OF US HUMANS SLEEP,
WE TEND TO DREAM, RIGHT?

811
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:35,875
THE PIONS MOVEMENTS WERE
IDENTICAL TO EEG READINGS

812
00:47:35,958 --> 00:47:37,958
TAKEN DURING REM SLEEP.

813
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:43,416
- FORGIVE ME, BUT, I REALLY
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE
YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS.

814
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:48,583
- SIMPLY PUT, THE EIZO HAD
A SYSTEM THAT COULD FREELY
MANIPULATE ELEMENTARY PARTICLES,

815
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:50,916
WHICH THEY TUNED TO
SOMEONE'S DREAMS,

816
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
AND TRIED TO REMAKE THE WORLD.

817
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:55,458
- SURELY, EVEN FOR THEM
THAT ISN'T...

818
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:57,375
- TRY TO THINK ABOUT IT
IN THIS WAY.

819
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:00,000
THE EIZO POSSESSED THE SYSTEM.

820
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:02,791
BUT THEY SIMPLY LACKED
THE MEANS TO ACTIVATE IT.

821
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,750
SO, THEY TRIED TO MAKE SOMEONE
HERE THROW THE SWITCH.

822
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:11,166
MAYBE THE AGEHA MYTH
WAS THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL.

823
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:13,375
- IT WAS A BOOBY-TRAP.

824
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:17,708
- WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE
THE MANUAL TOOK THE FORM OF
AN EMOTIONALLY CHARGED STORY?

825
00:48:17,791 --> 00:48:20,750
AND WHAT ABOUT THE SWITCH?
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE IT IS?

826
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,500
- IT CAN'T BE HELPED.

827
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:35,958
AFTER ALL, I'M NOT EVEN HUMAN.

828
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:42,875
- Hap: WHAT DID I TELL YOU?
IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME
TO TRY TO WIN HIM OVER.

829
00:48:42,958 --> 00:48:45,500
EVEN IF RENTON
WAS CHOSEN BY EUREKA,

830
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:47,791
IN THE END,
HE'S A NORMAL HUMAN.

831
00:48:47,875 --> 00:48:49,000
HE'S NOT LIKE THE REST OF US.

832
00:48:50,458 --> 00:48:52,541
ARE YOU LISTENING
TO A WORD I'M SAYING?

833
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:54,708
- YEAH, I'M LISTENING.

834
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:57,750
- FACE IT, HOLLAND,
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME HERE.

835
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:59,958
THERE'S NO TELLING
HOW LONG WE REALLY HAVE,

836
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:02,750
EVEN IF WE DO KEEP
SHOOTING UP THE DATU-RA.

837
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:04,416
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

838
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,041
- DO YOU REALLY?
DO YOU REALLY GET IT?

839
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,583
ANYWAY, YOU'RE TOO OPTIMISTIC.

840
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:13,500
YOU TOOK IN RENTON
WITHOUT ANY REAL PROOF.

841
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,250
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU SAVE US
ALL A LOT OF TROUBLE, AND--

842
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:20,291
- I KNOW, DAMN IT!
I KNOW...

843
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:22,500
WHEN WE KILLED
MAJ. GEN. SORENSTAM

844
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:25,541
AND WIPED OUT
THE 277TH MOBILE UNIT,

845
00:49:25,625 --> 00:49:28,791
IT WAS BECAUSE
OUR SURVIVAL WAS AT STAKE.

846
00:49:28,875 --> 00:49:32,000
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

847
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:35,500
TELL ME, SOMETHING, HAP,

848
00:49:35,583 --> 00:49:37,708
HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK
WE'RE GOING HAVE TO KILL

849
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,750
BEFORE WE'RE THROUGH
WITH ALL OF THIS?

850
00:49:39,833 --> 00:49:41,125
- ( door squeaks )

851
00:49:42,166 --> 00:49:44,458
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE!

852
00:49:44,541 --> 00:49:47,416
YOU AREN'T HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT
WHAT WE'RE DOING, ARE YOU?

853
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,625
- WHAT?

854
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:50,416
- IT'S TOO LATE
TO HAVE COLD FEET.

855
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,750
YOU SET THIS WHOLE THING
IN MOTION, REMEMBER?

856
00:49:53,833 --> 00:49:56,958
SO WHY DON'T YOU START SHOWING
A LITTLE SPINE, DAMN IT!

857
00:49:57,041 --> 00:49:59,375
JUST BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T
DONE ANYTHING TO RENTON

858
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:01,958
DOESN'T MAKE UP FOR THE CRIMES
WE'VE ALREADY COMMITTED!

859
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:05,791
- IF WE INJECT RENTON
WITH A MASSIVE DOSE OF
THE TRUTH SERUM 99T

860
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:09,666
TO BRAINWASH HIM, WE'LL BE ABLE
TO MAKE HIM DO WHATEVER WE WANT.

861
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:12,291
BUT IF WE DO THAT,
IT'LL DESTROY HIS MIND.

862
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:14,708
RENTON WILL BE A ZOMBIE.

863
00:50:14,791 --> 00:50:16,541
- MAYBE, BUT HE
CAN'T BE PERSUADED!

864
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:18,750
YOU SAW HIS REACTION EARLIER!

865
00:50:18,833 --> 00:50:20,750
HE'LL NEVER BE TALKED INTO
WORKING WITH US!

866
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:23,458
HE'LL TRY TO STOP US,
MARK MY WORDS!

867
00:50:23,541 --> 00:50:25,041
- I JUST--

868
00:50:25,125 --> 00:50:27,166
- I JUST DON'T...

869
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,250
I JUST DON'T WANT TO
HURT A LITTLE KID.

870
00:50:30,958 --> 00:50:33,958
- WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO IT,
WE'RE REALLY KIDS, TOO.

871
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:38,750
- ( alarm buzzing )

872
00:50:38,833 --> 00:50:40,291
- ALERT CODE 2!

873
00:50:40,375 --> 00:50:42,000
DO YOU THINK
THE ARMY'S SPOTTED US?

874
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:43,625
- THERE'S NO BACKING OUT NOW.

875
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,208
AFTER THIS BATTLE IS OVER,

876
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:49,958
I'LL INJECT RENTON
WITH THE 99T TRUTH SERUM.

877
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:53,375
- SATISFIED?
- AYE-AYE.

878
00:50:53,458 --> 00:50:55,708
LET'S GET TO IT.
BATTLE STATIONS!

879
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:57,416
- ( footsteps running away )

880
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:08,708
- Gidget: CONTACTS CONFIRMED!
THREE INBOUND BANDITS!

881
00:51:08,791 --> 00:51:10,750
ALL ARE YUNAGI-CLASS
ATTACK CARRIERS!

882
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:14,250
ESTIMATED TIME OF
ENEMY INTERCEPT, 1706!

883
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:16,208
- NOW THAT
WE CAN'T USE NIRVASH,

884
00:51:16,291 --> 00:51:19,041
I'D HAVE TO SAY WE'RE ON
JUST ABOUT AN EVEN FOOTING.

885
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:22,666
BY THE WAY, WHERE IN THE WORLD
IS TALHO? WHAT'S SHE DOING?

886
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,875
WE CAN'T EVEN MAKE DEFCON
ANNOUNCEMENTS WITHOUT HER!

887
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,208
- I'D HEARD STORIES.

888
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:30,625
BUT I HAD NO IDEA
IT WOULD FEEL THIS BAD.

889
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:34,250
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
I'M SCARED.

890
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:37,875
PLEASE, SOMEBODY...

891
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:41,500
- TALHO! TALHO! TALHO!
TALHO, WHAT'S WRONG!

892
00:51:46,916 --> 00:51:50,041
- ARE YOU OKAY, RENTON?
- EUREKA?

893
00:51:50,125 --> 00:51:52,083
- A BATTLE IS JUST ABOUT
TO BEGIN OUT THERE.

894
00:51:52,166 --> 00:51:54,416
IF YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF ALL THE CONFUSION,

895
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,041
YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO GET OFF THE SHIP.

896
00:51:57,833 --> 00:52:01,041
- EUREKA, YOUR WOUNDS?

897
00:52:01,125 --> 00:52:04,708
- THE CREW OF THE SHIP SAY THAT
THEY'RE GOING TO BRAINWASH YOU
AFTER THE BATTLE, RENTON.

898
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:06,041
I'M NOT ABOUT TO LET THEM
DO THAT TO YOU.

899
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,833
SO PLEASE, HURRY UP AND RUN.

900
00:52:09,916 --> 00:52:11,708
- SLOW DOWN A MINUTE!
WHAT ARE YOU SAY--

901
00:52:11,791 --> 00:52:14,375
- PLEASE, RENTON!
GET OUT NOW!

902
00:52:14,458 --> 00:52:16,750
- Gidget: ENEMY OFF
OUR STARBOARD BOW!

903
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:20,833
ETA TO CONTACT IS... WAIT,
ENEMY KLF LAUNCHES DETECTED!

904
00:52:20,916 --> 00:52:22,333
I'M COUNTING 12!

905
00:52:22,416 --> 00:52:25,125
- HEY, SO NOW THIS FIGHT
IS GONNA BE 4 ON 1?

906
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,208
- NO, SIX.
- HUH?

907
00:52:27,291 --> 00:52:29,250
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH HOLLAND, THEN?

908
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:31,291
- HOLLAND'S HERE WITH US
ON THE BRIDGE.

909
00:52:31,375 --> 00:52:33,250
HE'LL BE COMMANDING THE BATTLE
FROM HERE.

910
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:36,458
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE!
YOU EXPECT US TO FIGHT
WITHOUT HOLLAND?

911
00:52:36,541 --> 00:52:38,750
- I DO.
- GET REAL, MAN!

912
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:41,916
- Hilda: TALHO ISN'T
ON THE BRIDGE.

913
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,125
IT CAN'T BE.

914
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:45,708
HEY! HOLLAND COME IN!

915
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:47,875
TALHO ISN'T IN
THE SICK BAY, IS SHE?

916
00:52:47,958 --> 00:52:51,000
ANSWER ME! TALHO'S TIME HASN'T
STARTED TO RUN OUT, HAS IT?

917
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,375
- NO WAY! IT'S WAY TOO SOON
FOR THAT, ISN'T IT?

918
00:52:56,458 --> 00:52:59,458
- YEAH, BUT--
- ALL RIGHT! STAY COOL, PEOPLE!

919
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:03,000
FOR NOW, WE ALL NEED TO FOCUS
ON WIPING OUT THE ENEMY
THAT'S IN FRONT OF US.

920
00:53:03,083 --> 00:53:04,583
- BUT, HOLLAND, ARE YOU--

921
00:53:04,666 --> 00:53:07,916
- THIS IS NO TIME TO WORRY ABOUT
THE LIFE OF JUST ONE PERSON.

922
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:10,791
I HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE MANY.

923
00:53:10,875 --> 00:53:12,875
ABOUT THE LIVES OF
EACH EVERY PERSON

924
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:14,791
SERVING ON BOARD THIS SHIP.

925
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:17,708
- LASER FIRE DETECTED!
AAM'S INBOUND!

926
00:53:23,666 --> 00:53:27,375
- Hap: ARMOR PLATING DAMAGED!
DAMMIT! PROXIMITY FUSES!

927
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:29,375
- SHOW OF FORCE, HUH?

928
00:53:29,458 --> 00:53:32,041
- SONS OF BITCHES!
WE'LL WIPE EVERY ONE
OF YOU OUT!

929
00:53:35,208 --> 00:53:37,500
- CRAP! IT SOUNDS LIKE
THEY'VE STARTED.

930
00:53:37,583 --> 00:53:39,875
WE BETTER GET MOVING, EUREKA!

931
00:53:39,958 --> 00:53:42,541
- I'M SORRY.
BUT I'M STAYING HERE.

932
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:45,208
- WHAT? WHAT'RE YOU SAYING?

933
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:47,375
IF YOU STAY HERE, YOU'LL DIE!

934
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:49,708
- I KNOW THAT!
- THEN WHY?

935
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:52,083
- I TOLD YOU.
I'M NOT HUMAN.

936
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:53,708
- EUREKA!

937
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:56,125
- DON'T YOU SEE,
I HAVE A MISSION!

938
00:53:56,208 --> 00:53:59,000
BUT THE THING IS,
NOW I DON'T WANT TO COMPLETE IT.

939
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:07,958
- SO WHAT'S THIS MISSION?
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

940
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:11,791
I'M A SPY ROBOT
WHO WAS SENT HERE BY THE EIZO.

941
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:14,625
THE ARMY PEOPLE SAID THAT
THE CRYSTAL THAT'S INSIDE ME

942
00:54:14,708 --> 00:54:17,833
CONTAINS A RECORD OF
EVERYTHING I'VE EVER
EXPERIENCED ON THIS WORLD.

943
00:54:19,041 --> 00:54:21,875
THEY SAID THE EIZO
PROBABLY WANT IT.

944
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:23,833
THAT'S WHAT
THEY TOLD ME, ANYWAY.

945
00:54:23,916 --> 00:54:25,375
- WHAT FOR?

946
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:28,583
- TO LEARN HUMANITY'S
WEAKNESSES, THEY SAID.

947
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:30,958
THEY SAID IT WAS TO LEARN
HOW TO WIPE OUT HUMANKIND.

948
00:54:33,125 --> 00:54:36,041
BUT I... I DON'T WANT
THAT TO HAPPEN.

949
00:54:38,416 --> 00:54:41,250
I'VE BEEN THROUGH
LOTS OF TERRIBLE THINGS.

950
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:44,583
LOTS OF PAINFUL
AND SAD THINGS, TOO.

951
00:54:44,666 --> 00:54:48,625
BUT IF MY LIVING IS GOING
TO MAKE YOU SUFFER, RENTON,

952
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:51,000
THEN I'D SOONER DIE.

953
00:54:52,791 --> 00:54:56,958
IF I DIE, THE EIZO WON'T BE ABLE
TO DESTROY HUMANITY.

954
00:54:57,041 --> 00:54:59,875
IF I DIE ALONG WITH
THE PEOPLE ON THIS SHIP,

955
00:54:59,958 --> 00:55:01,791
THEN YOU WON'T SUFFER
ANYMORE, RENTON.

956
00:55:03,458 --> 00:55:05,916
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT THE PEOPLE ON
THIS SHIP ARE UP TO.

957
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:09,958
THE ONLY THING
I CAN SAY FOR CERTAIN

958
00:55:10,041 --> 00:55:11,791
IS THEY WENT AFTER YOU
BECAUSE I WAS HERE.

959
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:13,500
- THERE'S JUST WAY
TOO MANY OF THEM!

960
00:55:13,583 --> 00:55:15,791
- Eureka: IF IT WEREN'T FOR ME,
YOU WOULDN'T BE INVOLVED.

961
00:55:15,875 --> 00:55:18,750
- CAN'T WE FIND A WAY TO HIDE
FROM THOSE BANZAI JUMBOS?
- YEAH? HIDE WHERE?

962
00:55:20,291 --> 00:55:21,583
WE CAN HIDE IN THERE!

963
00:55:22,458 --> 00:55:24,125
- Eureka: I'M SORRY, RENTON.

964
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:27,375
I DRAGGED YOU IN,
GOT YOU INVOLVED.

965
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:29,958
ALL OF THIS, IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

966
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:34,750
EVEN SO I WAS GLAD.

967
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:38,166
I GOT TO SEE YOU
AT THE VERY END.

968
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:39,916
IT'S ENOUGH FOR ME.

969
00:55:42,166 --> 00:55:44,166
I DON'T HAVE ANY REGRETS NOW.

970
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:46,750
- THAT'S A LOAD OF CRAP!

971
00:55:46,833 --> 00:55:50,208
THERE YOU GO AGAIN,
DECIDING THINGS WITHOUT ME,

972
00:55:50,291 --> 00:55:52,291
MAKING IT EASY
JUST FOR YOURSELF!

973
00:55:52,375 --> 00:55:55,250
BUT DID YOU EVER ONCE STOP
AND THINK ABOUT MY FEELINGS?

974
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,958
- OH, CRAP! IT'S AN AMBUSH!

975
00:56:06,041 --> 00:56:07,958
- AH, MAN!
SORRY GUYS! HOLD ON!

976
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,125
- RENTON!

977
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:29,375
- I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE A ROBOT
OR AN EIZO, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

978
00:56:29,458 --> 00:56:32,708
I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF
FATE YOU'RE BURDENED WITH.

979
00:56:32,791 --> 00:56:36,541
THE POUNDING IN MY HEART
WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER,
THAT'S WHAT'S REAL.

980
00:56:36,625 --> 00:56:37,958
THAT'S WHAT I'M FEELING!

981
00:56:39,291 --> 00:56:41,875
ANYONE WHO TRIES TO
TAKE THOSE FEELINGS AWAY,

982
00:56:41,958 --> 00:56:43,625
I'M GONNA FIGHT THEM.

983
00:56:43,708 --> 00:56:47,083
I DON'T CARE IF IT'S
THE PEOPLE ON THIS SHIP,
THE ARMY, OR THE EIZO.

984
00:56:47,166 --> 00:56:48,666
I'LL FIGHT THEM ALL!

985
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:52,166
- RENTON, SAVE ME, I BEG YOU.

986
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:55,750
SAVE ME FROM ALL
THE SCARY THINGS IN THE WORLD!

987
00:56:55,833 --> 00:56:57,875
- Woz: MULTIPLE TYPE-3 ALARMS!

988
00:56:57,958 --> 00:57:00,416
DOING REPAIRS
DURING COMBAT IMPOSSIBLE!

989
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,958
- ( alarms blaring )

990
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:10,125
- WHERE THE HELL
ARE YOU GOING, HOLLAND?

991
00:57:10,208 --> 00:57:12,000
- I'M GOING OUT
IN THE DEVILFISH.

992
00:57:12,083 --> 00:57:13,666
THE BRIDGE IS YOURS.

993
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:16,083
- Hap: WHAT THE HELL?
- NOW WHAT?

994
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:18,166
- THE CATAPULT'S OPENING UP
ALL ON ITS OWN!

995
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,000
WHAT?

996
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:26,250
- LIFE SIGNS DETECTED
INSIDE THE NIRVASH!

997
00:57:26,333 --> 00:57:27,916
IT'S CORPORAL THURSTON
AND EUREKA!

998
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,791
- THOSE FRIGGIN'
LITTLE BASTARDS!

999
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:30,875
THEY'RE DESERTING
DURING A FIGHT?

1000
00:58:18,875 --> 00:58:22,208
- Gidget: DESTRUCTION OF
ALL ENEMY FLYING
FORTRESSES CONFIRMED.

1001
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:24,916
THE REMAINING KLFS
ARE RETREATING FAST.

1002
00:58:26,458 --> 00:58:29,250
- Hap: "...SENT FORTH FROM
THE PROMISED RAINBOW,

1003
00:58:29,333 --> 00:58:32,166
"THE BEING SHALL QUELL
THE ANIMOSITY OF THE LAND
WITHOUT FIGHTING."

1004
00:58:33,833 --> 00:58:35,375
ARE THEY THE ONES?

1005
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:38,041
HOLLAND, ARE THEY REALLY
THE CHOSEN MAIDEN AND BOY?

1006
00:58:38,875 --> 00:58:40,791
COULD THEY BE WENDY AND PETER?

1007
00:58:43,208 --> 00:58:45,875
- WE GOT A LOCK-ON WARNING!
WHERE THE HELL'S IT COMING FROM?

1008
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:47,291
- Gidget: THE ARMY'S IN RETREAT!

1009
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:50,666
THE ONLY ARMED CRAFT IN
THIS SECTOR ARE US AND OUR KLFS!

1010
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:54,666
- THE TARGETING LOCK
IS COMING FROM A SHIP
THAT'S DEAD AHEAD OF US!

1011
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:55,708
300 METERS!

1012
00:58:59,208 --> 00:59:00,916
- ( all gasping )

1013
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,041
- IS HE GOING TO ATTACK
THE BRIDGE DIRECTLY?

1014
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,916
- HEY, COMMANDER HOLLAND?
I WANNA TALK TO YOU.

1015
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,666
- I'M HERE.

1016
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:12,125
WHAT'S WRONG?
WHY AREN'T YOU
ATTACKING US?

1017
00:59:12,208 --> 00:59:15,541
- BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T
ANSWERED MY QUESTION YET.

1018
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:16,875
- WHAT?

1019
00:59:16,958 --> 00:59:19,208
I UNDERSTAND WHO YOU ARE NOW.

1020
00:59:19,291 --> 00:59:22,916
BUT WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS
WHAT YOU NEEDED ME FOR.

1021
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,375
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO
GET ME AND EUREKA TO DO.

1022
00:59:26,458 --> 00:59:29,166
WHAT IS IT THAT EXACTLY THAT
YOU ARE TRYING TO USE US FOR?

1023
00:59:31,416 --> 00:59:34,708
- I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU.
WE'RE TRYING TO GET BACK.

1024
00:59:34,791 --> 00:59:37,666
BACK TO THAT LUSH WORLD
OF NEVERLAND,

1025
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:42,291
A PLACE WHERE WE ALL
BELONG BEFORE OUR TIME
FINALLY RUNS OUT.

1026
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:45,750
TO DO THAT, WE HAVE TO RECREATE
THE TRAGEDY OF DOHA,

1027
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:49,416
THE MAJOR EXPERIMENT
THAT WE WERE ALL FORCED
TO PARTICIPATE IN,

1028
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:53,416
THAT WAS BASED ON
THE WARSAWA CULT'S
MYTH REGENERATION PROJECT.

1029
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,750
- RECREATE IT?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

1030
00:59:55,833 --> 00:59:59,791
UNFORTUNATELY,
THE OPERATION WE WERE
PART OF WAS A FAILURE,

1031
00:59:59,875 --> 01:00:03,666
BUT LATER ON, WE LEARNED
THAT THEY WERE ALREADY
WORKING ON A NEW PROJECT,

1032
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:06,625
ONE USING AN ITEM WITH
A BETTER CHANCE OF SUCCEEDING.

1033
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:09,833
MYTH REGENERATION PROJECT,
PENDING ISSUE E7.

1034
01:00:09,916 --> 01:00:12,125
A.K.A. "EUREKA SEVEN".

1035
01:00:14,208 --> 01:00:17,958
THE EIZO PUT A CRYSTAL INSIDE
EUREKA WHEN THEY MADE HER.

1036
01:00:18,041 --> 01:00:21,791
IT CONTAINS A PASSWORD MEANT TO
ALLOW EUREKA TO FUSE WITH THEM.

1037
01:00:21,875 --> 01:00:23,791
WHEN SHE FUSES WITH THE EIZO,

1038
01:00:23,875 --> 01:00:26,666
AN EXTRA-DIMENSIONAL DOOR
WILL OPEN INSIDE IT.

1039
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:29,333
AND THE KEY TO THAT DOOR
IS YOU RENTON.

1040
01:00:30,541 --> 01:00:32,083
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

1041
01:00:32,166 --> 01:00:35,375
- I HAVE NO REASON TO
KEEP TALKING TO SOMEONE
WHO WON'T HELP US.

1042
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:38,041
- WHAT?
- I HAVE A PROPOSAL.

1043
01:00:39,625 --> 01:00:41,250
WHY DON'T YOU
JOIN FORCES WITH US?

1044
01:00:42,541 --> 01:00:45,541
I CAN SEE HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT EUREKA.

1045
01:00:45,625 --> 01:00:48,875
BUT JUST LIKE MY PEOPLE AND I
CAN'T SURVIVE IN THIS WORLD,

1046
01:00:48,958 --> 01:00:51,375
YOU TWO CAN'T LIVE OUT
YOUR LIVES TOGETHER
HERE, EITHER.

1047
01:00:52,791 --> 01:00:57,291
LOOK, RENTON, YOU AND I
ARE BIRDS OF A FEATHER.

1048
01:00:57,375 --> 01:00:59,583
IF WE CAN ALL JUST
GET TO NEVERLAND,

1049
01:00:59,666 --> 01:01:02,250
THEN WE'LL BE ABLE TO
LIVE OUT OUR LIVES.

1050
01:01:02,333 --> 01:01:04,666
IT'S A FAIR DEAL,
DON'T YOU THINK, RENTON?

1051
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:07,250
- WOULD SOMEONE TELL ME
WHAT THE HELL
THIS "NEVERLAND" IS?

1052
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:10,375
AND WHAT'LL HAPPEN TO US
WHEN WE FINALLY GET THERE?

1053
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:14,625
- NEVERLAND IS SAID TO BE
A WORLD WHERE TIME
JUST STANDS STILL.

1054
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:17,750
A WORLD WHERE YOU CAN STAY
THE WAY YOU ARE FOREVER.

1055
01:01:17,833 --> 01:01:19,333
SO WHAT'LL IT BE?

1056
01:01:19,416 --> 01:01:21,708
WILL YOU KILL US
AND TAKE EUREKA,

1057
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:24,666
WHO MIGHT DIE AT ANY TIME,
AND FIGHT OFF THE ENTIRE WORLD?

1058
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:26,791
OR WILL YOU COME WITH US
AND SAVE US ALL?

1059
01:01:34,583 --> 01:01:38,791
- NIRVASH CALLING THE GEKKO.
WE ACCEPT YOUR DEAL.

1060
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:42,333
RENTON THURSTON AND EUREKA
WILL HEREBY JOIN FORCES
WITH THE GEKKO.

1061
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:53,458
- WAIT! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- RENTON, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1062
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:57,291
- I KNEW I COULDN'T TRUST YOU!
- WE'RE GOING ON A DATE.

1063
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:00,625
- UH, WHAT?
- A DATE!

1064
01:02:00,708 --> 01:02:04,083
GEEZ, MAN, HAVEN'T YOU EVER
HEARD OF A DATE BEFORE?

1065
01:02:04,166 --> 01:02:06,500
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
- WE'LL BE BACK IN 30 MINUTES.

1066
01:02:06,583 --> 01:02:10,041
I'LL LEAVE MY IKF RUNNING,
ALL RIGHT? SATISFIED?

1067
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:13,541
- OVER AND OUT.
- HEY! WAIT A MINUTE!

1068
01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:14,958
RENTON!

1069
01:02:15,041 --> 01:02:17,708
- WHAT'S THE HARM
IN LETTING HIM GO?

1070
01:02:17,791 --> 01:02:21,166
UNLIKE THE TWO OF YOU,
THEY'VE BEEN KEPT APART
FOR YEARS.

1071
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:23,041
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, TALHO?

1072
01:02:23,958 --> 01:02:26,166
- TALHO? WHEN DID YOU--

1073
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:28,541
- WE'VE BEEN DECEIVING THE BOY
ALL THIS TIME.

1074
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:30,875
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD
GIVE HIM SOME SLACK.

1075
01:02:30,958 --> 01:02:34,458
BESIDES, I THINK YOU'RE JUST MAD
BECAUSE YOU'RE JEALOUS.

1076
01:02:38,875 --> 01:02:42,250
- Renton: WE'RE NOT REALLY
ALL THAT DIFFERENT,
THOSE PEOPLE AND ME.

1077
01:02:42,333 --> 01:02:43,833
- HUH?

1078
01:02:43,916 --> 01:02:46,666
JUST LIKE THEY TURNED REBEL
FOR A CAUSE THEY BELIEVED IN

1079
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:49,500
AND IN THE PROCESS
KILLED A LOT OF PEOPLE,

1080
01:02:49,583 --> 01:02:52,291
I'VE ALSO TAKEN LIVES FOR
SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE IN.

1081
01:02:52,375 --> 01:02:54,666
SOMETHING I THOUGHT
WAS IMPORTANT

1082
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:56,916
AND IT'S NOT JUST PEOPLE.

1083
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,458
I'VE KILLED LOTS OF EIZO, TOO.

1084
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:02,958
WILL I END UP KILLING A LOT MORE
PEOPLE BEFORE THIS IS OVER?

1085
01:03:04,458 --> 01:03:07,791
WHY DID ALL THIS HAPPEN?
HOW'D WE GET HERE?

1086
01:03:07,875 --> 01:03:11,625
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW IT ALL CAME TO THIS.

1087
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:15,333
I WISH WE COULD HAVE STAYED THE
WAY WE WERE IN WARSAWA FOREVER.

1088
01:03:16,333 --> 01:03:19,583
- I'M GLAD WE GREW UP.

1089
01:03:19,666 --> 01:03:23,375
IT WAS BECAUSE YOU GREW UP
THAT YOU FINALLY ABLE TO COME
AND GET ME.

1090
01:03:23,458 --> 01:03:27,125
AND BECAUSE I GREW UP,
I, UM... I, UH...

1091
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:30,625
I WANT TO LIVE MY LIFE.

1092
01:03:30,708 --> 01:03:33,458
EVEN IF IT'S A FAKE LIFE,
I WANT TO LIVE IT.

1093
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:36,583
ALONG WITH YOU, RENTON.

1094
01:03:39,125 --> 01:03:41,375
- EUREKA.
- YES?

1095
01:03:42,291 --> 01:03:43,833
- CHECK IT OUT, NO HANDS.

1096
01:03:46,416 --> 01:03:47,708
- ( Eureka screaming)

1097
01:03:58,208 --> 01:04:00,166
RENTON, YOU'RE SUCH A IDIOT!

1098
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:04,250
YOU SCARED ME HALF TO DEATH!
SERIOUSLY, I WAS TERRIFIED!

1099
01:04:04,333 --> 01:04:06,416
- STAY WITH ME.

1100
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,458
IF I KNOW YOU'RE
ALWAYS AT MY SIDE,

1101
01:04:08,541 --> 01:04:10,291
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING
I CAN'T TAKE ON!

1102
01:04:11,166 --> 01:04:12,500
I NEED YOU EUREKA.

1103
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:21,000
- DO ME A FAVOR.

1104
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:23,416
I WANT TO TAKE A NAP TOGETHER,

1105
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,666
JUST LIKE WE DID
WHEN WE WERE LITTLE.

1106
01:04:33,625 --> 01:04:35,458
- ( gun firing )

1107
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:40,666
- SIGMA 01 CALLING SIGMA 02.
REQUEST CLARIFICATION.

1108
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:42,750
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
THEIR CONTROLS
AREN'T RESPONDING?

1109
01:04:42,833 --> 01:04:45,416
- THIS IS SIGMA 02.
I DON'T KNOW.

1110
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:48,250
LAMBDA SQUAD WENT SILENT
RIGHT AFTER THEY CALLED IN

1111
01:04:48,333 --> 01:04:50,583
FROM UP AHEAD
WITH THAT COMPLAINT.

1112
01:04:50,666 --> 01:04:53,583
- ACKNOWLEDGED.
SIGMA 01 CALLING HQ.

1113
01:04:53,666 --> 01:04:57,125
UNABLE TO ASCERTAIN CAUSE OF
LAMDA, ZETA, AND OMEGA SQUAD'
DISAPPEARANCE.

1114
01:04:57,208 --> 01:04:59,333
REQUEST PERMISSION TO WITHDRAW.

1115
01:04:59,416 --> 01:05:03,458
- HQ Commander: ACKNOWLEDGED.
PERMISSION GRANTED TO
RETREAT TO LINE 6-7-0-0.

1116
01:05:03,541 --> 01:05:05,875
- ROGER. ALL UNITS,
ABORT SEARCH.

1117
01:05:05,958 --> 01:05:08,541
BEGIN WITHDRAWAL
TO LINE 6-7-0-0.

1118
01:05:08,625 --> 01:05:10,458
- Sigma 03: COMMANDER!
- WHAT IS IT?

1119
01:05:10,541 --> 01:05:12,500
- STELLAR WAVE DETECTED
AT 1 O'CLOCK!

1120
01:05:12,583 --> 01:05:14,458
- IT'S CLOSING IN!
- IS IT EIZO?

1121
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:17,333
- NO, SIR! I'M GETTING AN IKF!
IT'S A LAMDA...

1122
01:05:17,416 --> 01:05:19,375
NO, WAIT!
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

1123
01:05:22,083 --> 01:05:24,583
- WHAT'S WRONG? WHAT HAPPENED?
- WHAT? WHAT WAS THAT?

1124
01:05:24,666 --> 01:05:27,375
( Sigma 03 screaming )

1125
01:05:27,458 --> 01:05:30,583
- WHAT'S WRONG, SIGMA 03?
- IT'S NO USE, COMMANDER!

1126
01:05:30,666 --> 01:05:32,458
- 02! WHAT'S WRONG?
- MY ARCHETYPE, IS--

1127
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:37,000
- HQ CALLING SIGMA 01.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

1128
01:05:37,083 --> 01:05:40,041
WE'RE LOSING YOUR IKF SIGNALS.
BOOST THE GAIN!

1129
01:05:40,125 --> 01:05:43,916
- Sigma 01: IT'S NO USE,
MY ARCHETYPE
ISN'T RESPONDING TO--

1130
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,708
- HQ Commander:
WHAT'S WRONG, 01?
SIGMA 01, COME IN!

1131
01:05:46,791 --> 01:05:48,583
SIGMA 01!

1132
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:57,041
- Hap: SO, DO YOU THINK
HIS HEART'S IN THIS OR NOT?

1133
01:05:57,125 --> 01:05:58,916
- WHOSE HEART IS IN WHAT?

1134
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,916
- HOLLAND.
- WHAT ABOUT HIM?

1135
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,500
- MAYBE HE'S HAD
A CHANGE OF HEART AFTER
SEEING HIS LADY COLLAPSE.

1136
01:06:05,583 --> 01:06:08,666
I MEAN, COME ON,
RENTON GETS A LOCK ON US,

1137
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:12,375
AND HOLLAND GIVES THEM
FREE RUN OF THE SHIP
WITHOUT ANY PUNISHMENT.

1138
01:06:12,458 --> 01:06:16,125
YOU SAW THAT, RIGHT?
YOU SAW HOW THE
NIRVASH COULD FIGHT.

1139
01:06:16,208 --> 01:06:17,916
- IN THE AGEHA MYTH,

1140
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,208
THE WHITE SACRED ONE IS
SUPPOSED TO PURIFY ITS ENEMIES

1141
01:06:20,291 --> 01:06:22,666
WITHOUT HAVING TO FIGHT.

1142
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:25,541
BUT THAT THING ENGAGED
A WHOLE DAMN ARMY FLOTILLA.

1143
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:27,541
WHY'D IT DO THAT?

1144
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:32,500
- UH, WAIT A JUST MINUTE,
YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO SAY
THEY'RE FAKES, ARE YOU?

1145
01:06:32,583 --> 01:06:36,416
- I DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE IT,
BUT MAYBE WE'VE ALL BEEN HAD.

1146
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,375
- BEEN HAD? BY WHAT?

1147
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:43,416
- WE STOLE EUREKA ON
THE ASSUMPTION THAT SHE WAS
THE ARMY'S TOP SECRET ITEM.

1148
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:48,333
NOW THINK ABOUT IT.
WHAT IF THE THING WE RECOVERED
WASN'T THE REAL EUREKA?

1149
01:06:48,416 --> 01:06:51,666
AND WHAT IF HOLLAND KNEW
ALL ABOUT IT AND JUST DIDN'T
BOTHER TO TELL US?

1150
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:54,625
- WHAT'RE YOU GETTING AT?
- TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

1151
01:06:54,708 --> 01:06:58,250
THIS PICTURE IS BASED ON
THE AGEHA MYTH.

1152
01:06:58,333 --> 01:07:01,708
THE MAIDEN DESCRIBED
IN THE AGEHA MYTH
HAD WINGS ON HER BACK.

1153
01:07:01,791 --> 01:07:04,000
SHE SAVES THE LAND
AND GUIDES LOST SOULS,

1154
01:07:04,083 --> 01:07:06,416
AND TO PROVE HER IDENTITY,
SHE HAS--

1155
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:09,708
- WAIT. EUREKA DOESN'T
HAVE WINGS.

1156
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:12,166
- WE CAN'T TRUST
HOLLAND ANYMORE.

1157
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:14,708
WHICH IS WHY I'M STARTING TO
THINK WE HAVE TO CHECK THIS OUT.

1158
01:07:15,291 --> 01:07:16,541
PERSONALLY.

1159
01:07:17,875 --> 01:07:21,375
- Kuzemi: NOW, ABOUT
THESE UNEXPLAINED KLF RUNAWAYS,

1160
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:25,541
ACCORDING TO THE ARMY,
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY
TO COUNTERACT THEM!

1161
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:30,375
SURELY YOU KNOW THAT WE CANNOT
HOLD EIZO IN CHECK WITHOUT KLFS!

1162
01:07:30,458 --> 01:07:32,833
WE'D BE DEFENSELESS.

1163
01:07:32,916 --> 01:07:35,208
- Braya: HOW MUCH TIME
DO WE HAVE?

1164
01:07:35,291 --> 01:07:38,333
- WE DO NOT HAVE ANY!
LOOK AT THIS.

1165
01:07:38,416 --> 01:07:41,166
KLF RUNAWAYS HAVE ALREADY
BEEN CONFIRMED

1166
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:45,041
IN 80 PERCENT OF THE
HUMAN-CONTROLLED TERRITORIES.

1167
01:07:45,125 --> 01:07:49,666
AND YET, YOU STILL HAVE QUALMS
ABOUT FIRING THE HAMMER OF GOD?

1168
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:52,875
- I AM FRIGHTENED.
- FRIGHTENED?

1169
01:07:52,958 --> 01:07:56,916
- SURELY YOU MUST KNOW
THAT THE ENTIRE WORLD
WILL BE BURIED IN ASH

1170
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,666
FROM THE EFFECTS
OF THE HAMMER OF GOD.

1171
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:04,083
IS WOUNDING OUR OWN
MOTHER PLANET AN ACTION
THAT WE REALLY SHOULD TAKE?

1172
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:07,791
- WELL, PERHAPS THAT
SENTIMENTALITY IS WHAT
COST YOU YOUR MARRIAGE.

1173
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:11,125
- HMM.
- ( chuckles ) MY APOLOGIES.

1174
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:15,625
IN ANY EVENT, WE CHOSEN PEOPLE
WILL BE SAFE AND SOUND
ON THE ESCAPE SHIP.

1175
01:08:15,708 --> 01:08:17,791
WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE
THE WISE DECISION.

1176
01:08:23,625 --> 01:08:25,833
- TOO SENTIMENTAL, AM I?

1177
01:08:25,916 --> 01:08:29,291
WOULD AN OVERLY SENTIMENTAL MAN
SEND HIS OWN EX-WIFE

1178
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:33,000
SCRAMBLING AROUND ON A
MILLION-TO-ONE LONG SHOT
INVESTIGATION?

1179
01:08:34,208 --> 01:08:36,708
ON AN INVESTIGATION FOR HOPE.

1180
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,375
- Jurgens: MINISTER KODA,
IT'S JUST AS YOU SAID.
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM

1181
01:08:42,458 --> 01:08:44,041
THAT THE YOUNG SOLDIER
NAMED RENTON THURSTON

1182
01:08:44,125 --> 01:08:48,833
IS THE SON OF THE WARSAWA CULT
GROUP'S TECHNICAL SUPERVISOR.

1183
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:51,750
- Morita: EVIDENCE SUGGESTS
THAT THIS GIRL-SHAPED EIZO

1184
01:08:51,833 --> 01:08:55,708
WAS BEING RAISED ALONGSIDE
THIS BOY THAT WE BELIEVE WAS
THE SAME AGE.

1185
01:08:57,250 --> 01:09:00,166
GOING FROM THE FEW REMAINING
RECORDS WE COULD DECIPHER,

1186
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:03,500
IT SEEMS THAT THE CULTISTS WERE
ALWAYS RECORDING THEIR DREAMS.

1187
01:09:03,583 --> 01:09:06,000
- RECORDING THEIR DREAMS?
- YES.

1188
01:09:06,083 --> 01:09:07,708
AND JUDGING FROM
THOSE RECORDINGS,

1189
01:09:07,791 --> 01:09:09,708
I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT
THEIR EXPERIMENTS

1190
01:09:09,791 --> 01:09:14,625
WERE MEANT TO CAUSE
THE BOY AND GIRL TO
ACTUALLY SHARE THEIR DREAMS.

1191
01:09:14,708 --> 01:09:19,166
OR RATHER, TO CAUSE THE GIRL
TO HAVE THE SAME DREAM
THAT THE BOY WAS HAVING.

1192
01:09:22,166 --> 01:09:24,500
- Maria: WAIT.
IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

1193
01:09:24,583 --> 01:09:27,291
- Koda: PERHAPS,
BUT ALL THE PIECES FIT.

1194
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:31,250
I THINK IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME
THAT THESE CHILDREN OF NEVERLAND

1195
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:35,875
ARE TRYING TO USE
THE YOUNG THURSTON BOY
AND THE SECRET ITEM EUREKA

1196
01:09:35,958 --> 01:09:38,666
TO CREATE THEIR VISION
OF AN IDEAL WORLD.

1197
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:44,000
PERHAPS THEIR GOAL IS
A STATIC WORLD WHERE TIME
SIMPLY STANDS STILL.

1198
01:09:44,083 --> 01:09:48,541
I MEAN, THEY ARE AGING SEVERAL
TIMES FASTER THAN NORMAL.

1199
01:09:48,625 --> 01:09:50,166
- BUT, JUST A MINUTE, MA'AM.

1200
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:52,041
WHEN THE TRAGEDY
OF DOHA HAPPENED,

1201
01:09:52,125 --> 01:09:55,208
THEY WERE USING OVER
4000 GIGAWATTS OF ENERGY.

1202
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:57,875
THAT'S AS MUCH POWER
AS A COUNTRY USES.

1203
01:09:57,958 --> 01:09:59,875
WHERE IN THE WORLD
WOULD THEY GET IT?

1204
01:09:59,958 --> 01:10:02,416
- THEY DON'T NEED TO GO OUT
AND FIND IT.

1205
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:05,666
ALL THEY REALLY NEED TO DO
IS TO JUMP INTO IT.

1206
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:08,958
INTO THE ENERGY
OF THE HAMMER OF GOD.

1207
01:10:09,041 --> 01:10:13,541
IF WE DON'T
FIRE THE HAMMER OF GOD,
HUMANITY WILL BE WIPED OUT.

1208
01:10:13,625 --> 01:10:17,750
BUT IF WE DO FIRE IT,
WE'LL HAVE A REPEAT OF
THE TRAGEDY OF DOHA.

1209
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:20,708
HUMANITY STANDS
BETWEEN ANNIHILATION

1210
01:10:20,791 --> 01:10:22,750
AND TOTAL DEVASTATION.

1211
01:10:29,208 --> 01:10:32,208
- SO, DID YOU...
- NO, SORRY.

1212
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:34,208
- ME NEITHER.

1213
01:10:34,291 --> 01:10:36,791
I BET IT'S BECAUSE
WE WERE APART FOR SO LONG.

1214
01:10:38,416 --> 01:10:40,750
- TELL ME.
- WHAT IS IT?

1215
01:10:40,833 --> 01:10:45,500
I WANT TO KNOW, IF YOU REALLY
TRUST THE PEOPLE THAT ARE
ABOARD THIS SHIP?

1216
01:10:45,583 --> 01:10:48,708
- DIDN'T I TELL YOU? I'LL FIGHT
ALL OF THE PEOPLE ON THIS SHIP,

1217
01:10:48,791 --> 01:10:51,083
ALL OF HUMANITY, AND EIZO.

1218
01:10:51,166 --> 01:10:54,916
THE ONLY THINGS I BELIEVE IN
ARE YOU AND NIRVASH.

1219
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:09,416
UH, EUREKA!

1220
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:13,083
I-I'M SORRY! I DIDN'T MEAN--
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

1221
01:11:13,166 --> 01:11:16,666
- SHEESH, DON'T ASK ME THAT!
TO THE LAVATORY!

1222
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:19,958
EVEN ROBOTS MADE BY
THE EIZO HAVE TO GO TO
THE LAVATORY SOMETIMES!

1223
01:11:24,083 --> 01:11:25,791
SHEESH, I DON'T BELIEVE HIM.

1224
01:11:25,875 --> 01:11:28,541
I DIDN'T THINK THAT RENTON
WOULD BE SO SHORT ON TACT.

1225
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:37,166
( exclaims )

1226
01:11:44,458 --> 01:11:45,500
WHAT WAS THAT?

1227
01:11:48,708 --> 01:11:50,541
- Holland: WHAT'S WRONG?
WHAT THE HELL ARE THESE TREMORS?

1228
01:11:50,625 --> 01:11:53,416
- IT'S NOT AN EXTERNAL ATTACK!
I DON'T BELIEVE IT!

1229
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,916
- IT'S FROM INSIDE THE SHIP!
- HOW COULD THAT BE?

1230
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,791
- Woz: STELLAR WAVES
DETECTED IN THE HANGAR!

1231
01:11:57,875 --> 01:12:00,250
- WHAT?
- THEY'RE COMING
FROM ALL THE KLFS.

1232
01:12:00,333 --> 01:12:03,208
IT'S NO USE!
THE ARCHETYPES CAN'T
MAINTAIN THEIR SHAPE!

1233
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:07,500
- THIS IS BAD.

1234
01:12:07,583 --> 01:12:09,583
REVERSE THE FANS AND VENT THE
BREATHABLE AIR FROM THE HANGARS!

1235
01:12:09,666 --> 01:12:11,500
LOW OXYGEN WILL KNOCK OUT
THE ARCHETYPES!

1236
01:12:11,583 --> 01:12:12,958
- Gidget: I CAN'T!

1237
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:15,083
I'M READING ONE LIFE SIGN
IN HANGAR 1!

1238
01:12:15,166 --> 01:12:18,250
WAIT JUST A MINUTE.
OH, NO, IT'S EUREKA!

1239
01:12:18,333 --> 01:12:21,208
- NIRVASH! PLEASE STOP!
NIRVASH, PLEASE STOP THIS!

1240
01:12:25,083 --> 01:12:27,666
WHY? WHY, NIRVASH?

1241
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:30,500
YOU DON'T HAVE TO REACT
THIS WAY! PLEASE STOP!

1242
01:12:30,583 --> 01:12:33,083
- Gidget: BRIDGE CALLING
ALL CREW! SOMEBODY, ANYBODY!

1243
01:12:33,166 --> 01:12:36,708
GET TO THE HANGAR AND PULL
EUREKA AWAY FROM THE KLFS
BEFORE SHE GETS KILLED!

1244
01:12:41,208 --> 01:12:43,041
- Eureka: NIRVASH! NIRVASH!

1245
01:12:44,458 --> 01:12:47,291
- RENTON?
- WHAT THE HELL?

1246
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:53,041
- YOU LITTLE BITCH!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
STOP HIM RIGHT NOW!

1247
01:12:53,125 --> 01:12:56,041
- STOP HIM HOW?
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT!

1248
01:12:56,666 --> 01:12:57,833
- BULLSHIT!

1249
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:02,458
OR MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
MAYBE YOU REALLY CAN'T STOP HIM.

1250
01:13:04,791 --> 01:13:09,000
YOU'RE NOT REALLY
THE TOP SECRET ITEM WE ALL
THOUGHT YOU WERE, ARE YOU?

1251
01:13:09,083 --> 01:13:12,500
HOW LONG'S IT BEEN?
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN TRICKING HUMANS?

1252
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:14,583
- NO! NO!

1253
01:13:14,666 --> 01:13:16,416
- NOW, NOW, JUST QUIT FIGHTING!

1254
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,875
- LIKE A FAKE HUMAN
NEEDS ANY MODESTY!

1255
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:19,916
- ( Eureka screams )

1256
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:26,083
- WHAT THE...

1257
01:13:26,708 --> 01:13:28,166
NIRVASH!

1258
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:33,833
( gasps )

1259
01:13:34,791 --> 01:13:36,458
- Hap: JUST LIKE I THOUGHT.

1260
01:13:36,541 --> 01:13:40,416
- DAMMIT! WE'VE BEEN BEING DUPED
BY A FAKE THIS WHOLE TIME?

1261
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:43,416
- WELL, THIS JUST PROVES IT.
HOLLAND'S BEEN LYING.

1262
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:44,875
- BASTARD!

1263
01:13:44,958 --> 01:13:47,750
WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU DO TO EUREKA?

1264
01:13:49,833 --> 01:13:51,791
- SON OF A BITCH!
- CUT IT OUT!

1265
01:13:52,708 --> 01:13:54,583
- I'LL KILL YOU! I'LL KILL YOU!

1266
01:13:54,666 --> 01:13:56,666
I'LL KILL ANYBODY WHO EVEN
THINKS ABOUT HURTING EUREKA!

1267
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:58,541
- HEY, STOP IT!

1268
01:13:58,625 --> 01:14:00,541
STOP, DAMN IT! STOP!

1269
01:14:00,625 --> 01:14:01,958
- ( gunfire )

1270
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:10,208
- WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

1271
01:14:11,541 --> 01:14:13,333
HAP!

1272
01:14:13,416 --> 01:14:16,000
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?
HOW ARE THE KLFS?

1273
01:14:16,083 --> 01:14:17,958
- Hap: IT WASN'T MY FAULT.
- HUH?

1274
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:19,208
- IT WASN'T MY--

1275
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:28,833
- HAP, WHAT...
- ( Nirvash squeaks loudly )

1276
01:14:35,166 --> 01:14:36,791
- WHAT THE HELL?

1277
01:14:46,625 --> 01:14:50,708
- ( cries ) NO!

1278
01:14:54,291 --> 01:14:57,333
- Koda: YOU'RE SAYING THE FIRING
CAN NO LONGER BE STOPPED?

1279
01:14:57,416 --> 01:14:58,541
- Braya: YES.

1280
01:14:58,625 --> 01:15:00,875
- EVEN IF THE REPEAT OF
THE TRAGEDY OF DOHA

1281
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:03,416
ANNIHILATES THE SOLAR SYSTEM?

1282
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,458
OR MAYBE EVEN THE ENTIRE GALAXY?

1283
01:15:06,541 --> 01:15:09,083
- A COUNTRY CAN'T OPERATE
ON SPECULATION.

1284
01:15:09,166 --> 01:15:12,875
- LOOK AT THIS FOOTAGE.
- WHAT IS THIS?

1285
01:15:12,958 --> 01:15:17,166
- FOURTEEN HOURS AGO,
THE EIZO WORLDWIDE BEGAN
ASSEMBLING IN ANTARCTICA.

1286
01:15:18,333 --> 01:15:20,083
NOT COINCIDENTALLY,

1287
01:15:20,166 --> 01:15:24,375
THE TIMING COINCIDES WITH
THE DESTRUCTION OF KLFS
AROUND THE WORLD.

1288
01:15:24,458 --> 01:15:27,708
- THEY'RE PREPARING
FOR A FINAL BATTLE, TOO?

1289
01:15:27,791 --> 01:15:32,166
- OUR CALCULATIONS SHOW THAT
IF WE FIRE THE HAMMER OF GOD
AT FULL POWER,

1290
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:34,250
WE CAN ANNIHILATE THEM
ALL IN ONE BLAST.

1291
01:15:35,583 --> 01:15:38,291
- SO IT REALLY IS TOO LATE.

1292
01:15:38,375 --> 01:15:41,708
- I HAVE A HIGH-SPEED AIRCRAFT
STANDING BY.

1293
01:15:41,791 --> 01:15:44,750
SHOW THEM YOUR TICKET,
AND THEY WILL TAKE YOU
TO THE SPACEPORT.

1294
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:49,083
BEAR WITNESS TO THE FUTURE
IN MY PLACE.

1295
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:53,583
- IF YOU AND I HAD
BORNE CHILDREN TOGETHER,

1296
01:15:53,666 --> 01:15:56,583
I EXPECT YOU WOULD BE SAYING
THOSE WORDS TO SOMEONE ELSE.

1297
01:15:59,291 --> 01:16:01,250
- I SUPPOSE I WOULD.

1298
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:05,500
- Holland: SO, ARE YOU
FEELING BETTER NOW?

1299
01:16:05,583 --> 01:16:08,333
- Talho: YES, I'M FINE.
- THAT'S GOOD.

1300
01:16:08,416 --> 01:16:10,708
I HEARD ALL ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO RENTON.

1301
01:16:10,791 --> 01:16:13,125
THE NEXT THREE DAYS
WILL BE CRITICAL.

1302
01:16:13,208 --> 01:16:16,708
- IT LOOKS LIKE OUR LUCK
HASN'T QUITE RUN OUT JUST YET.

1303
01:16:16,791 --> 01:16:20,041
THE HAMMER OF GOD
WILL FIRE 12 HOURS FROM NOW.

1304
01:16:20,125 --> 01:16:23,750
IF WE CAN USE NIRVASH
IN HIS LARVAL STATE,
WE MIGHT STILL PULL THIS OFF.

1305
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:30,083
- IF WE CAN
ACTUALLY MAKE IT THERE,

1306
01:16:30,166 --> 01:16:32,750
WILL WE REALLY BE HAPPY
IN NEVERLAND?

1307
01:16:32,833 --> 01:16:34,375
- WHO KNOWS?

1308
01:16:34,458 --> 01:16:37,333
BUT IF WE DON'T GO,
WE'VE SIMPLY GOT NO FUTURE.

1309
01:16:37,416 --> 01:16:40,291
- TELL ME, HOLLAND,
WHAT'S THE FUTURE TO YOU?

1310
01:16:41,541 --> 01:16:45,500
- WELL, MY FUTURE IS YOU.

1311
01:16:45,583 --> 01:16:49,958
A WORLD THAT YOU'RE A PART OF.
THE FUTURE YOU ALWAYS DREAM OF.

1312
01:16:50,041 --> 01:16:53,125
THAT'S MY FUTURE.
I DON'T NEED ANYTHING ELSE.

1313
01:16:54,416 --> 01:16:57,375
- HOLLAND, I NEED TO TELL YOU...
- ( door opens )

1314
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:00,375
- WE NEED YOU
ON THE BRIDGE, HOLLAND.

1315
01:17:00,458 --> 01:17:03,125
WE'RE ABOUT TO START
OUR FINAL LANDING APPROACH.

1316
01:17:03,208 --> 01:17:04,875
WE MADE IT, HOLLAND.

1317
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:07,083
WE MADE IT TO THE
PINK-HAIRED WOMAN'S PLACE.

1318
01:17:27,291 --> 01:17:29,125
- IT'S ALL TURNED AROUND.

1319
01:17:29,208 --> 01:17:31,333
EVERYTHING IS
ALL MY FAULT, ISN'T IT?

1320
01:17:32,708 --> 01:17:34,541
I'M SORRY, RENTON.

1321
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,250
BUT NOW
BECAUSE THIS HAPPENED,

1322
01:17:38,333 --> 01:17:41,458
FINALLY UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU FEEL, RENTON.

1323
01:17:41,541 --> 01:17:44,208
HOW YOU FELT WHEN YOU CAME
TO SEE ME WHEN I WAS LOCKED UP

1324
01:17:44,291 --> 01:17:47,083
AND UNABLE TO BE
WITH YOU LIKE BEFORE.

1325
01:17:47,166 --> 01:17:52,000
HOW YOU FELT ALL THOSE YEARS
LATER WHEN YOU CAME TO
RESCUE ME IN NIRVASH.

1326
01:17:52,083 --> 01:17:55,041
OH, RENTON, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
I LOVE YOU.

1327
01:17:56,958 --> 01:17:58,416
SO PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T DIE.

1328
01:18:00,708 --> 01:18:02,625
- ( squeaks )

1329
01:18:02,708 --> 01:18:04,791
- MM-MM, I WON'T LET YOU.

1330
01:18:04,875 --> 01:18:09,250
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN EVER BE
AS BRAVE AS YOU ARE, RENTON,
BUT I...

1331
01:18:09,333 --> 01:18:11,500
BUT I PROMISE
I WON'T LET YOU DIE.

1332
01:18:11,583 --> 01:18:14,750
- ( squeaks )

1333
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:16,583
- THANK YOU. THANKS, NIRVASH.

1334
01:18:22,208 --> 01:18:25,708
- Maria: I'M AFRAID
I MIGHT BE A FAILURE
AS YOUR SECRETARY, MA'AM.


1335
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:28,625
I'M UNABLE TO STICK WITH YOU
TO THE BITTER END,


1336
01:18:28,708 --> 01:18:30,875
AND YOU'VE EVEN GIVEN ME
YOUR TICKET.

1337
01:18:30,958 --> 01:18:32,291
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1338
01:18:32,375 --> 01:18:37,083
YOU REALLY HAVE DONE
MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR ME, MARIA.

1339
01:18:37,166 --> 01:18:39,458
- YOU'RE GOING WHERE NO. 6 IS,
AREN'T YOU?

1340
01:18:39,541 --> 01:18:41,708
- I HAVE TO SEE THIS THROUGH.

1341
01:18:41,791 --> 01:18:46,000
SO I'LL KEEP DIGGING
AT THE TRUTH RIGHT UP TO
THE END OF THE WORLD.

1342
01:18:46,083 --> 01:18:50,500
EVEN IF I DON'T CATCH UP
WITH NO.7 OR THE CHILDREN
OF NEVERLAND.

1343
01:18:50,583 --> 01:18:52,250
- YOU'RE A FORMIDABLE WOMAN.

1344
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:54,750
- NO, I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHEN TO GIVE UP.

1345
01:18:54,833 --> 01:18:56,500
BESIDES,

1346
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:00,416
I SHOULD GO.

1347
01:19:01,333 --> 01:19:03,416
- MAY GOD WATCH OVER YOU.

1348
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:07,583
- GIVE JURGENS...
GIVE YOUR HUSBAND MY BEST.

1349
01:19:07,666 --> 01:19:09,166
BE HAPPY TOGETHER.

1350
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:12,458
- WE WILL!

1351
01:19:23,958 --> 01:19:27,500
- Woz: APPARENTLY,
THEY BUILT NO. 6'S
CONTAINMENT FACILITY HERE,

1352
01:19:27,583 --> 01:19:31,250
700 METERS BELOW
THE ABANDONED VODARAC SHRINE,

1353
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:35,291
OSTENSIBLY TO KEEP HER
FROM BEING DETECTED BY
EIZO INTERFERENCE WAVES.

1354
01:19:37,083 --> 01:19:41,291
- Ken-Goh: THAT'S HOW AFRAID
THEY WERE OF NO.6'S ABILITIES?

1355
01:19:41,375 --> 01:19:44,916
- THEY DIDN'T EXPECT IT
TO BE SO MASSIVE.

1356
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,750
- Holland: I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT IT TOOK TO BUILD ALL THIS.

1357
01:19:47,833 --> 01:19:50,625
I'M ACTUALLY SPEECHLESS
FOR ONCE.

1358
01:19:50,708 --> 01:19:52,916
- CONFIRMED ALL STOPPED.
HOLLAND?
- WHAT THE...

1359
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,041
- GOT IT.
YOU CAN LOWER THE CATAPULT.
WE'RE GOING ASHORE.

1360
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:59,000
- WAIT A MINUTE!
THERE'S SOMEONE UP AHEAD!

1361
01:19:59,083 --> 01:20:00,458
- NO WAY! THE ARMY?

1362
01:20:00,541 --> 01:20:02,125
- I'M PUTTING IT UP
ON THE SCREEN!

1363
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:08,791
- WHO... WHO THE HELL IS THAT?

1364
01:20:08,875 --> 01:20:11,250
- HOLLAND, YOU DON'T
SUPPOSE IT'S...

1365
01:20:11,333 --> 01:20:13,500
IT'S PROFESSOR DOMINIC'S FIANCE.

1366
01:20:13,583 --> 01:20:15,500
- HUH, HIS FIANCE?

1367
01:20:15,583 --> 01:20:18,708
- Eureka: SHE'S THE BEING THAT
YOU HUMANS DESIGNATED AS NO. 6.

1368
01:20:18,791 --> 01:20:20,541
I CAN TELL THAT'S HER

1369
01:20:20,625 --> 01:20:23,583
BECAUSE THAT PERSON
IS THE SAME AS ME.

1370
01:20:23,666 --> 01:20:26,083
THAT'S THE WOMAN THAT PROFESSOR
DOMINIC WAS IN LOVE WITH.

1371
01:20:26,916 --> 01:20:28,458
ANEMONE.

1372
01:20:30,041 --> 01:20:33,958
- I FINALLY GET TO MEET
ALL THOSE CHILDREN.

1373
01:20:34,041 --> 01:20:36,666
BUT I WASN'T ABLE TO
GET EVERYTHING READY.

1374
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:39,791
- ( squeaks )
- THAT'S TRUE.

1375
01:20:39,875 --> 01:20:43,291
I WAS ABLE TO FINISH THIS,
SO HE'LL FORGIVE US, WON'T HE?

1376
01:20:44,208 --> 01:20:47,208
IT BEGINS HERE. AND NOW.

1377
01:20:47,291 --> 01:20:49,833
BUT WILL THE CHILDREN BE HAPPY
ABOUT IT, I WONDER?

1378
01:20:51,666 --> 01:20:54,583
- Operator: THE HAMMER OF GOD
HAS ENTERED THE PLANNED AREA.

1379
01:20:54,666 --> 01:20:57,125
PRIMARY MECHANISM IS
CURRENTLY RUNNING AT 85 PERCENT.

1380
01:20:57,208 --> 01:20:58,875
- Braya: AND THE ANCILLARIES?

1381
01:20:58,958 --> 01:21:01,000
- DEPLOYMENT COMPLETION
IN 2 HOURS.


1382
01:21:01,083 --> 01:21:02,791
OPERATION SCHEDULE IS ON TIME.


1383
01:21:02,875 --> 01:21:05,000
ALL SYSTEMS ARE
RUNNING SMOOTHLY.


1384
01:21:05,083 --> 01:21:08,875
- YES. I SEE.
BUT TAKE A LOOK AT THAT CORE.

1385
01:21:08,958 --> 01:21:12,625
IT'S AS IF IT'S MADE THE LAND
ITSELF INTO A NURSERY BED.

1386
01:21:12,708 --> 01:21:15,666
JUST LIKE A FLOWER
OF THIS WORLD.


1387
01:21:17,166 --> 01:21:19,083
- EIZO INTERFERENCE
WAVE DETECTED!

1388
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:20,708
- Operator 2: MAGNITUDE,
LEVEL 9!

1389
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:24,708
BEARING IS 080 BY 225 BY 11!

1390
01:21:24,791 --> 01:21:28,083
- THAT'S THE VODARAC REGION!
- THE VODARAC REGION?

1391
01:21:28,166 --> 01:21:30,083
IS IT TARGETING NO. 6?

1392
01:21:30,166 --> 01:21:33,416
OR ELSE DOES THIS MEAN THAT
NO. 7 HAS ARRIVED THERE?

1393
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:37,208
- Holland: WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

1394
01:21:37,291 --> 01:21:40,750
IT'S ALMOST AS IF YOU KNEW
WE WERE COMING, ANEMONE.

1395
01:21:40,833 --> 01:21:44,583
- THERE'S SO MUCH I WANT TO
EXPLAIN, BUT THERE IS NO TIME.

1396
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:47,708
THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR HELP,
MY DEAR FRIEND.

1397
01:21:47,791 --> 01:21:49,000
- ( squeaks )

1398
01:21:49,083 --> 01:21:51,416
- THAT'S RIGHT.
PLEASE LOOK AFTER THEM FOR ME.

1399
01:21:58,375 --> 01:22:01,791
- WHAT'S YOUR GAME?
- I GAVE DOMINIC MY WORD.

1400
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:03,875
- YOUR WORD?

1401
01:22:03,958 --> 01:22:06,250
- IF THOSE WHO APPEARED
BEFORE ME WERE WITHOUT HOPE,

1402
01:22:06,333 --> 01:22:09,208
THE SEAL WOULD REMAIN.

1403
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:12,041
BUT IF THOSE WHO APPEARED HERE
DID HAVE HOPE,

1404
01:22:12,125 --> 01:22:15,250
I'D RELEASE THE SEAL FOR
THE SAKE OF THEIR WISHES.

1405
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:18,333
THEN, WHEN THE
WHITE SACRED ONE APPEARED,

1406
01:22:18,416 --> 01:22:21,083
I WOULD AID THEM AND
TRANSFORM THEIR HOPE

1407
01:22:21,166 --> 01:22:23,291
INTO A ROAD
THAT LEADS TO THE FUTURE.

1408
01:22:32,375 --> 01:22:33,458
- ( all gasping )
- WHAT THE...

1409
01:22:33,541 --> 01:22:35,666
- WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

1410
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:38,541
- NO WAY. THE EIZO!
- ( Gidget shrieks )

1411
01:22:38,625 --> 01:22:40,666
- GIDGET!
- ( groans )

1412
01:22:41,458 --> 01:22:43,291
HUH? MY GUN!

1413
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:45,375
- Eureka: TAKE RENTON
TO A HOSPITAL!

1414
01:22:45,458 --> 01:22:47,333
- EUREKA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1415
01:22:47,416 --> 01:22:49,083
- DIDN'T YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID?

1416
01:22:49,166 --> 01:22:51,916
I TOLD YOU TO START UP
THE GEKKO AND TAKE RENTON
TO A HOSPITAL!

1417
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,041
AND I MEAN RIGHT NOW!

1418
01:22:54,125 --> 01:22:57,583
DON'T MAKE ME ANY ANGRIER
THAN I ALREADY AM.

1419
01:23:01,958 --> 01:23:03,125
- ( squeaks sadly )

1420
01:23:03,208 --> 01:23:04,708
- ( door opens )

1421
01:23:09,708 --> 01:23:11,416
- ( whimpers )

1422
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,541
- ( The End squeaks happily )

1423
01:23:19,666 --> 01:23:21,750
- ( both squeaking )

1424
01:23:26,416 --> 01:23:28,750
- WHAT'S ALL THE RACKET?

1425
01:23:28,833 --> 01:23:30,625
( gasps )

1426
01:23:32,083 --> 01:23:33,500
PROFESSOR!

1427
01:23:33,583 --> 01:23:35,500
- IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, RENTON.

1428
01:23:37,083 --> 01:23:38,708
- CALM DOWN, EUREKA!

1429
01:23:38,791 --> 01:23:40,625
EVEN IF WE TOOK RENTON
TO A DOCTOR,

1430
01:23:40,708 --> 01:23:42,458
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE
HE COULD SAVE HIM!

1431
01:23:42,541 --> 01:23:43,666
YOU'RE BETTER OFF
COMING WITH US, SO--

1432
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:46,833
- NOT A CHANCE!
- EUREKA?

1433
01:23:46,916 --> 01:23:50,416
- I'VE DONE NOTHING
BUT RUN AWAY MY ENTIRE LIFE!

1434
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:54,041
I'D ALWAYS RUN AWAY,
USING MY MISSION
OR MY FATE AS EXCUSES!

1435
01:23:55,708 --> 01:23:58,208
BUT NOW I'M THROUGH
WITH RUNNING.

1436
01:23:58,291 --> 01:23:59,750
I'M GONNA FIGHT!

1437
01:23:59,833 --> 01:24:03,750
JUST LIKE RENTON HAS ALWAYS DONE
FOR ME HIS WHOLE LIFE.

1438
01:24:03,833 --> 01:24:05,500
FOR THE FUTURE
THAT I WANT TO SEE HAPPEN!

1439
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:22,375
- ( in young voice )
YOU'RE READY, I SEE.

1440
01:24:28,208 --> 01:24:32,250
- PROFESSOR, I'M SORRY.
- WHY?

1441
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:35,541
- BECAUSE IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
I'LL BE ABLE TO KEEP MY PROMISE.

1442
01:24:35,625 --> 01:24:38,208
- WHY NOT?
- LOOK AT ME.

1443
01:24:38,291 --> 01:24:40,291
MY BODY WON'T MOVE.

1444
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:42,333
NO MATTER HOW MUCH I ORDER IT
TO MOVE, IT WON'T LISTEN.

1445
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,916
WHY? WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN?

1446
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,750
WHY DOES MY BODY FREEZE UP
WHEN I NEED IT THE MOST?

1447
01:24:50,833 --> 01:24:54,708
- YOU'RE STILL THINKING
WITH YOUR HEAD?

1448
01:24:54,791 --> 01:24:58,833
IS THAT REALLY
WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED IN
THESE PAST 8 YEARS, RENTON?

1449
01:25:00,541 --> 01:25:02,666
- Anemone: I WONDER, EUREKA,

1450
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:07,833
DO YOU KNOW THE REAL REASON
THAT YOU AND I CAN'T HAVE
DREAMS? DO YOU?

1451
01:25:07,916 --> 01:25:10,666
THE REASON IS THAT WE OURSELVES
ARE NOTHING BUT DREAMS.

1452
01:25:12,583 --> 01:25:15,666
WE ARE MERELY IMAGINARY BEINGS
THAT WERE CREATED BY THE EIZO

1453
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:18,416
IN RESPONSE TO HUMAN DREAMS.

1454
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:21,875
THAT'S WHY DOMINIC FINALLY
HALTED THE EXPERIMENTS.

1455
01:25:21,958 --> 01:25:24,041
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT ME
TO JUST DISAPPEAR.

1456
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:28,791
I REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHERE THE EIZO CAME FROM.

1457
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:31,083
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE TRYING
TO ACCOMPLISH.

1458
01:25:31,166 --> 01:25:34,166
BUT THERE IS ONE THING
THAT I CAN SAY FOR CERTAIN.

1459
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:36,541
EVEN IF HUMANITY MAKES
CONTACT WITH THE EIZO,

1460
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:38,750
DREAMS ARE NOTHING
BUT DREAMS.

1461
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:41,083
REALITY CAN ONLY BE
CHANGED BY REALITY.

1462
01:25:41,166 --> 01:25:43,166
- WAIT A MINUTE!
IF THAT'S TRUE,

1463
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:45,791
HOW IS IT
THAT YOU AND I EXIST HERE?

1464
01:25:46,625 --> 01:25:48,750
- Dominic: HUMANS ARE FOOLISH.

1465
01:25:48,833 --> 01:25:52,291
THEIR SHALLOW IMAGINATION
PREMATURELY NIPPED IN THE BUD,

1466
01:25:52,375 --> 01:25:56,875
ALL THEIR HOPES FOR THE FUTURE.
AND THIS WORLD IS WHAT RESULTED.

1467
01:25:56,958 --> 01:25:58,875
DO YOU SEE IT, RENTON?

1468
01:25:59,416 --> 01:26:01,500
EIZO ARE A MIRROR.

1469
01:26:01,583 --> 01:26:06,166
A MIRROR THAT REFLECTS
THE TRUE NATURE OF
WHAT'S IN FRONT OF IT.

1470
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:08,166
- Anemone: I DON'T KNOW
THE REASON WHY.

1471
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:11,833
BUT YOU, I, EVEN THE EIZO,
ARE ALIVE.

1472
01:26:11,916 --> 01:26:14,083
THROUGH NO CHOICE OF OUR OWN.

1473
01:26:14,166 --> 01:26:19,041
FORCED TO BE ALIVE AS PART OF
THIS WORLD THAT'S SO FULL OF
FEAR AN DANGER.

1474
01:26:19,125 --> 01:26:23,125
OUR DEATHS WOULD SPELL
THE DEATH OF THIS WORLD ITSELF.

1475
01:26:23,208 --> 01:26:25,416
- WAIT A MINUTE! NO!

1476
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:28,958
IF THAT'S TRUE THEN,
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

1477
01:26:29,041 --> 01:26:31,875
YOU'RE READY NOW, RIGHT?

1478
01:26:31,958 --> 01:26:34,875
READY TO HAVE A DREAM
OF YOUR OWN.

1479
01:26:34,958 --> 01:26:39,500
- PROFESSOR, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT IS IT THAT I SHOULD DO?

1480
01:26:39,583 --> 01:26:42,958
- PLEASE, PROFESSOR, TELL ME!
- YOU ALREADY KNOW.

1481
01:26:44,666 --> 01:26:48,750
- SEARCH, RENTON.
NOT UP HERE, BUT HERE.

1482
01:26:48,833 --> 01:26:54,333
AH. WELL THEN.
MY TIME HERE IS UP.

1483
01:26:54,416 --> 01:26:56,666
- PROFESSOR, WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

1484
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:59,416
PROFESSOR! PROFESSOR!

1485
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:02,791
- I REALLY DO LOVE
YOUR ROUGH AND TUMBLE
WAY OF LIVING, RENTON.

1486
01:27:02,875 --> 01:27:07,666
SO I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU NOW
WITH SOME PARTING WORDS
THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO HELP YOU.

1487
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:09,625
THEY ARE...

1488
01:27:09,708 --> 01:27:14,583
- PROFESSOR! PROFESSOR!
PROFESSOR! PROFESSOR!

1489
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:16,583
- ( beeping )

1490
01:27:17,708 --> 01:27:19,708
- ( squeaking excitedly )

1491
01:27:23,083 --> 01:27:27,000
- I HEARD HIM, THE PROFESSOR.
HIS VERY LAST WORDS.

1492
01:27:31,333 --> 01:27:33,750
( screams )

1493
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:36,625
DON'T BEG FOR THINGS!
DO IT YOURSELF!

1494
01:27:36,708 --> 01:27:38,958
OR ELSE YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING!

1495
01:27:42,666 --> 01:27:43,958
- OH, CRAP!

1496
01:27:45,875 --> 01:27:48,916
- SAVE ME RENTON.
SAVE ME, RENTON!

1497
01:27:52,916 --> 01:27:55,541
- HE'S HERE.
- ( all gasp )

1498
01:28:05,583 --> 01:28:08,833
- WHAT THE HELL?
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

1499
01:28:11,541 --> 01:28:15,250
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
NIRVASH? IS THAT YOU?

1500
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:17,958
NIRVASH!

1501
01:28:47,125 --> 01:28:48,708
- Renton: EUREKA!

1502
01:28:51,333 --> 01:28:53,333
I'M SORRY, EUREKA.

1503
01:28:53,416 --> 01:28:55,583
I MIGHT NOT HAVE THE MEANS
OR EVEN THE COURAGE

1504
01:28:55,666 --> 01:28:58,250
TO PROTECT YOU
LIKE I WANT TO JUST YET.

1505
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:01,916
BUT PROFESSOR DOMINIC
TOLD ME WHAT TO DO!

1506
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,041
I WANT TO WIN THE FUTURE
WITH YOU, EUREKA!

1507
01:29:05,125 --> 01:29:08,583
SO COME ON!
LET'S GO TOGETHER, EUREKA!

1508
01:29:08,666 --> 01:29:10,666
I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART!

1509
01:29:11,958 --> 01:29:15,958
- ( sobs ) RENTON!
RENTON! RENTON!

1510
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:22,375
- HOLLAND, LOOK!

1511
01:29:22,458 --> 01:29:25,291
- Anemone: "ONE SHALL TRANSCEND
THE LIMITS OF THE WORLD.

1512
01:29:25,375 --> 01:29:27,666
"WHEN THE VOICE OF HIS BODY
AND SOUL RINGS OUT,

1513
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:31,250
"THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE,
AND THEY SHALL BECOME
THE WHITE SACRED ONE."

1514
01:29:31,333 --> 01:29:32,583
SO BE IT.

1515
01:29:32,666 --> 01:29:35,083
- Holland: WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

1516
01:29:35,166 --> 01:29:37,291
WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO
WITH THE TWO OF THEM?

1517
01:29:37,375 --> 01:29:38,833
- WHAT DID I DO?

1518
01:29:38,916 --> 01:29:40,958
I GAVE THEM SOME
ENCOURAGEMENT, THAT'S ALL.

1519
01:29:41,041 --> 01:29:43,833
- LOOK, IF WE DON'T
REENACT THE MYTH NOW,
WE'RE ALL GONNA BE DEAD!

1520
01:29:43,916 --> 01:29:45,875
- YOU KNEW THAT WAS...
- YOU'RE A SPOILED CHILD.

1521
01:29:45,958 --> 01:29:47,416
- WHAT?

1522
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:49,666
- WHY DIDN'T YOU EVEN BOTHER TO
TRY TO CREATE YOUR OWN MYTH?

1523
01:29:50,708 --> 01:29:52,041
LIKE THOSE TWO DID.

1524
01:29:52,541 --> 01:29:54,041
- NO WAY.

1525
01:29:54,125 --> 01:29:57,958
THIS IS THE RESULT OF THOSE TWO
REFUSING TO REENACT THE MYTH?

1526
01:29:59,708 --> 01:30:01,500
- ( gasps )
- WOW!

1527
01:30:01,583 --> 01:30:03,166
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

1528
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:05,541
- NOW, OFF YOU GO!
TO THE FUTURE!

1529
01:30:06,541 --> 01:30:07,625
- ( shrieks )

1530
01:30:14,458 --> 01:30:18,458
- Holland: IT'S GETTING AWAY.
OUR DREAMS. OUR FUTURE.

1531
01:30:20,208 --> 01:30:24,000
NO WAY. I WON'T LET YOU.
I WON'T LET YOU DO THIS!

1532
01:30:31,041 --> 01:30:34,291
- Braya: LONG AGO, IT WAS
BELIEVED BY MUCH OF THE WORLD

1533
01:30:34,375 --> 01:30:38,791
THAT THE SUN WAS A SUPREME BEING
THAT BESTOWED LIMITLESS ENERGY

1534
01:30:38,875 --> 01:30:40,041
WHO NEVER NEEDED TO BE REPAID.

1535
01:30:42,125 --> 01:30:44,833
THIS PROVIDED
A RATIONALE TO HUMANITY

1536
01:30:44,916 --> 01:30:47,125
FOR THEIR PENCHANT FOR
EXCESS AND CONSUMPTION.

1537
01:30:48,208 --> 01:30:49,958
AND TO PROVE THIS,

1538
01:30:50,041 --> 01:30:52,791
HUMANITY CREATED
THE HUMAN SACRIFICE,

1539
01:30:52,875 --> 01:30:55,500
WHOSE HEART WAS OFFERED
UP TO THE GODS.

1540
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:57,000
OH, THE IRONY.

1541
01:30:58,250 --> 01:31:01,500
ALAS, WE ARE NO DIFFERENT
FROM THE ANCIENTS.

1542
01:31:01,583 --> 01:31:04,916
WE HARNESS THE SUN'S ENERGY
AND USE IT AS A WEAPON

1543
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,375
TO BURN INVADERS
INTO SUBMISSION.

1544
01:31:07,458 --> 01:31:09,708
WHAT CAN ONE CALL THIS PRACTICE,

1545
01:31:09,791 --> 01:31:12,875
IF NOT THE ULTIMATE
IN EXCESS AND CONSUMPTION?

1546
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:15,708
MAY OUR POSTERITY FORGIVE US.

1547
01:31:15,791 --> 01:31:17,875
WE'VE TASTED
THE PLEASURE OF CONSUMPTION

1548
01:31:17,958 --> 01:31:20,041
AND CANNOT STOP OURSELVES.

1549
01:31:20,125 --> 01:31:22,375
OPERATION HAMMER OF GOD

1550
01:31:22,458 --> 01:31:23,791
INITIATE!

1551
01:31:58,625 --> 01:32:01,291
- Operator: SUN RAYS AT
PRIMARY MECHANISM!
COUNTDOWN COMMENCING!

1552
01:32:01,375 --> 01:32:05,291
T-MINUS 1246 SECONDS!
OBSERVATION, BEGIN INFO RELAY .

1553
01:32:06,916 --> 01:32:07,958
- Eureka: YOU IDIOT.

1554
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,125
RENTON, YOU'RE SUCH A IDIOT.

1555
01:32:11,208 --> 01:32:14,625
AS HURT AS YOU ARE,
YOU MIGHT DIE.

1556
01:32:14,708 --> 01:32:17,833
WHAT ON EARTH WERE YOU THINKING?
YOU IDIOT.

1557
01:32:17,916 --> 01:32:20,208
- STOP CALLING ME AN IDIOT.

1558
01:32:20,291 --> 01:32:23,708
I CAN'T REALLY HELP IT.
I AM AN IDIOT.

1559
01:32:23,791 --> 01:32:27,041
BUT I CAN'T BE AN IDIOT
FOR ANYONE BUT YOU, EUREKA.

1560
01:32:29,333 --> 01:32:30,750
- IDIOT.

1561
01:32:30,833 --> 01:32:33,250
BUT YOU'RE MY IDIOT.

1562
01:32:35,666 --> 01:32:38,166
- SO...
- YEAH?

1563
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:41,750
- WHAT'S NEXT?
WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?

1564
01:32:41,833 --> 01:32:46,250
- WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO?
- ANYWHERE IS FINE.

1565
01:32:46,333 --> 01:32:49,958
AS LONG AS YOU'RE THERE, RENTON,
I DON'T CARE WHERE WE GO.

1566
01:32:51,041 --> 01:32:53,541
- ( Nirvash squeaking )

1567
01:32:55,666 --> 01:32:57,333
- YEAH, NIRVASH.

1568
01:32:57,416 --> 01:32:59,958
- RENTON, WHAT DID NIRVASH SAY?

1569
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:01,791
- OH. WELL, HE JUST SAID--

1570
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:08,333
( grunting )

1571
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:12,291
- Holland: I'M IMPRESSED
YOU DODGED MY FIRE
HURT AS BAD AS YOU ARE.

1572
01:33:12,375 --> 01:33:14,250
I WISH I COULD BE A GENTLEMAN
AND COMPLIMENT YOU,

1573
01:33:14,958 --> 01:33:17,208
BUT I'M JUST NOT THAT MATURE.

1574
01:33:17,291 --> 01:33:20,250
NOW LISTEN UP.
I'LL ASK YOU ONE MORE TIME.

1575
01:33:20,333 --> 01:33:22,458
TURN AROUND AND
COME WITH US TO NEVERLAND!

1576
01:33:29,125 --> 01:33:33,000
I SEE. SO THAT'S YOUR
FINAL ANSWER, RENTON?

1577
01:33:33,083 --> 01:33:35,958
IT'S A SHAME.
IT'S A REAL SHAME.

1578
01:33:36,041 --> 01:33:39,833
AND HERE I THOUGHT YOU WERE
THE SAME KIND OF MAN AS ME!

1579
01:33:39,916 --> 01:33:42,125
- DON'T PUT ME ON YOUR LEVEL.
- WHAT?

1580
01:33:42,208 --> 01:33:44,500
- I NEVER USED PEOPLE
AS PLAYTHINGS

1581
01:33:44,583 --> 01:33:47,166
BECAUSE I'M SO RULED BY MY PAST.
I CAN'T STAND IT!

1582
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:54,000
- PLAYTHINGS?
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH!

1583
01:33:54,083 --> 01:33:57,208
HOW ARE YOU GONNA MAKE UP
FOR KILLING HAP AND STONER,
YOU LITTLE BASTARD?

1584
01:34:00,541 --> 01:34:02,333
- STOP TRYING TO
CHANGE THE SUBJECT!

1585
01:34:14,958 --> 01:34:16,000
- RENTON!

1586
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,416
- YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

1587
01:34:19,166 --> 01:34:21,416
YOU THINK YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL?

1588
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:24,416
HOW IT FEELS TO HAVE EVERYTHING
TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU?

1589
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:28,916
LOSING THE CHANCE TO
LAUGH AND LOVE AND DREAM
ABOUT YOUR FUTURE?

1590
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,875
YOU JUST COULDN'T KNOW
HOW THAT FEELS!

1591
01:34:34,083 --> 01:34:35,666
- Ken-Goh: IS THIS TRUE?

1592
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:38,166
- LOOK, I'M NOT
A REAL MEDICAL DOCTOR,

1593
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:40,125
SO I JUST CAN'T SAY
FOR CERTAIN.

1594
01:34:40,208 --> 01:34:43,625
BUT I FEEL SAFE IN SAYING
I'M 99 PERCENT SURE.

1595
01:34:43,708 --> 01:34:45,375
- WELL, WELL.

1596
01:34:45,458 --> 01:34:47,166
- Moondoggie: THAT
SETTLES IT, THEN!

1597
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:50,125
HEY GIDGET!
CAN YOU GET US THE 20 ON
THAT BONEHEAD HOLLAND?

1598
01:34:50,208 --> 01:34:53,833
- YOU BET! HOLLAND LEFT
HIS IKF TRANSMITTING.

1599
01:34:53,916 --> 01:34:57,000
- Ken-Goh: RIGHT!
SOUND THE ALARM FOR ALL HANDS
TO FASTEN THEIR SEATBELTS!

1600
01:34:57,083 --> 01:35:00,625
- Woz: AYE-AYE!
- WHY ARE YOU DOING ALL THIS?

1601
01:35:00,708 --> 01:35:04,000
- COME ON, YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO BUCKLE UP, TOO, TALHO.

1602
01:35:04,083 --> 01:35:06,250
ALL OF US ARE GOING
TO HITCH A RIDE.

1603
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:08,458
ON THE FUTURE
GROWING INSIDE YOU.

1604
01:35:11,833 --> 01:35:12,708
- THANK YOU.

1605
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:15,083
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.

1606
01:35:16,541 --> 01:35:19,375
THE RADIANCE UNLEASHED
BY THE HAMMER OF GOD.

1607
01:35:19,458 --> 01:35:22,375
I WONDER WHAT SORT OF FUTURE
IS WAITING FOR US?

1608
01:35:22,458 --> 01:35:25,291
A GREY PURGATORY?
OR TOTAL NOTHINGNESS?

1609
01:35:25,375 --> 01:35:28,333
- Anemone: GOOD QUESTION.
WHO'S TO SAY?

1610
01:35:28,416 --> 01:35:31,833
ALL MYTHS ARE WOVEN
ACCORDING TO THE WHIMS
OF THE STORYTELLER.

1611
01:35:31,916 --> 01:35:34,833
AND IN ALL MYTHS, THE TELLER
IS NEVER A PARTICIPANT

1612
01:35:34,916 --> 01:35:37,458
IN THE TALE THAT'S BEING TOLD.

1613
01:35:37,541 --> 01:35:40,250
YOU GOT HERE JUST IN TIME,
MADAM STORYTELLER.

1614
01:35:40,333 --> 01:35:41,500
- NO. 6!

1615
01:35:41,583 --> 01:35:43,833
- NOW, SHALL WE WATCH TOGETHER?

1616
01:35:45,125 --> 01:35:47,708
LET'S SEE HOW OUR NEW MYTH
UNFOLDS BEFORE US.

1617
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:54,541
- IT WON'T STOP. THE BLEEDING,
IT JUST WON'T STOP!

1618
01:35:54,625 --> 01:35:58,375
NO! RENTON, DON'T FALL ASLEEP!
RENTON, WAKE UP!

1619
01:35:58,833 --> 01:36:00,291
- ( shrieks )

1620
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,416
- COME BACK HERE!

1621
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:24,833
- ( Eureka screams )

1622
01:36:30,333 --> 01:36:31,541
- Holland: DAMMIT!

1623
01:36:41,625 --> 01:36:45,041
I WON'T ACCEPT IT.
I WILL NEVER ACCEPT IT. NEVER!

1624
01:36:45,125 --> 01:36:49,375
A LIFE OF BEING USED,
OF BEING DISCARDED.
A LIFE NOT WORTH LIVING!

1625
01:36:49,458 --> 01:36:52,083
NO! I'LL NEVER ACCEPT IT!

1626
01:36:52,166 --> 01:36:56,000
COMPRESSOR TO MAXIMUM!
DISTORTION CANCELER DISENGAGED!

1627
01:36:56,083 --> 01:37:00,916
- OH, NO! THAT IDIOT HOLLAND HAS
SET HIS COMPAC FEEDBACK SYSTEM
TO MAXIMUM SETTING!

1628
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,416
- HOLLAND, NO! HOLLAND!

1629
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,500
- REST EASY, TALHO.

1630
01:37:05,583 --> 01:37:08,000
I'LL BLAZE A TRAIL
TO THE FUTURE FOR YOU.

1631
01:37:08,083 --> 01:37:12,750
I'LL BRING BACK
THE WHITE SACRED ONE
EVEN IF IT COSTS ME MY LIFE.

1632
01:37:12,833 --> 01:37:16,375
SO TAKE MY PLACE AND
REENACT THE MYTH FOR ME, GUYS.

1633
01:37:16,458 --> 01:37:20,791
AND PROTECT TALHO'S LIFE FOR ME.
PROTECT TALHO'S FUTURE FOR ME!

1634
01:37:20,875 --> 01:37:22,125
( groans )

1635
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:34,000
- Renton: NIRVASH SAID
SOMETHING TO ME A MINUTE AGO.

1636
01:37:34,083 --> 01:37:35,291
- ( soft crying )

1637
01:37:35,375 --> 01:37:36,750
- HE SAID HE'D TAKE US BACK
TO OUR NEVERLAND.

1638
01:37:39,083 --> 01:37:43,041
I REALLY WANTED THE TWO OF US
TO WALK UNDER NEVERLAND'S SUN,

1639
01:37:43,125 --> 01:37:47,291
HAND IN HAND TOGETHER.
BUT I'M SORRY, EUREKA,

1640
01:37:47,375 --> 01:37:50,541
I DON'T THINK I'LL BE ABLE
TO SAY WE'LL DO IT
TOGETHER THIS TIME.

1641
01:37:50,625 --> 01:37:52,541
- WE'LL GO TOGETHER!

1642
01:37:54,916 --> 01:37:56,583
RENTON!

1643
01:37:59,833 --> 01:38:01,500
- ( heavy breathing )

1644
01:38:19,333 --> 01:38:20,375
- PAPA!

1645
01:38:24,625 --> 01:38:25,416
- HOLLAND!

1646
01:38:36,208 --> 01:38:38,625
- WHY'D YOU DO IT?

1647
01:38:38,708 --> 01:38:41,125
WHY'D YOU KEEP IT
A SECRET, TALHO?

1648
01:38:41,208 --> 01:38:42,791
- I'M SORRY. BUT...

1649
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:45,583
COME ON, IF I'D TOLD YOU,
YOU'D HAVE GIVEN IT ALL UP.

1650
01:38:45,666 --> 01:38:48,000
YOU WOULD HAVE GIVEN UP
YOUR OWN DREAMS.

1651
01:38:48,083 --> 01:38:49,833
THAT'S THE KIND OF A MAN
YOU ARE.

1652
01:38:51,333 --> 01:38:52,916
- YOU WANNA HAVE IT, RIGHT?

1653
01:38:53,791 --> 01:38:54,833
- YES.

1654
01:38:56,291 --> 01:38:57,875
- REMEMBER?

1655
01:38:57,958 --> 01:39:01,583
WHATEVER FUTURE YOU WANT,
THAT'S MY FUTURE, TOO.

1656
01:39:02,541 --> 01:39:04,333
- I'M SORRY.

1657
01:39:04,416 --> 01:39:08,041
I'M SO SORRY. I'M SO SORRY.

1658
01:39:08,125 --> 01:39:11,708
- LISTEN, HOLLAND,
THE HUMAN BODY IS
A WONDROUS THING.

1659
01:39:11,791 --> 01:39:14,333
YOUR AND TALHO'S BABY IS
DEVELOPING AT A RATE

1660
01:39:14,416 --> 01:39:16,833
NO DIFFERENT FROM
ANY OTHER HUMAN.

1661
01:39:16,916 --> 01:39:18,416
- ( gasps )

1662
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:21,750
ITS DEVELOPMENT IS
COMPLETELY UNAFFECTED BY
TALHO'S GROWTH RATE.

1663
01:39:21,833 --> 01:39:26,125
WHEN IT'S BORN, IT WON'T BE
ANY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER
NORMAL HUMAN BABIES.

1664
01:39:26,208 --> 01:39:27,583
- YOU'RE KIDDING.

1665
01:39:27,666 --> 01:39:29,125
- Moondoggie: THAT MEANS
OUR CURSE...

1666
01:39:29,208 --> 01:39:31,833
- Ken-Goh: ...WON'T BE PASSED
DOWN TO THE NEXT GENERATION.

1667
01:39:31,916 --> 01:39:33,583
- DOGGIE, KEN-GOH.

1668
01:39:33,666 --> 01:39:36,833
- Gidget: WE ALREADY HEARD
THE WHOLE STORY FROM TALHO.

1669
01:39:36,916 --> 01:39:39,375
- Matthieu: YEAH, BUT YOU
UP AND BOLTED, MAN!

1670
01:39:39,458 --> 01:39:41,666
- Woz: YOU EVEN TOOK
A SUPER PACK WITH YOU.

1671
01:39:42,541 --> 01:39:43,916
- Holland: GUYS.

1672
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
- Hilda: IF WE'RE GONNA
GET TO SEE YOUR KID'S FACE,

1673
01:39:46,083 --> 01:39:48,750
I'D SAY THIS WORLD ISN'T SO BAD.

1674
01:39:48,833 --> 01:39:51,541
NOPE. NOT BAD AT ALL.

1675
01:39:51,625 --> 01:39:54,125
- Talho: HOLLAND.
- YEAH?

1676
01:39:54,208 --> 01:39:56,166
I WANT TO SHOW IT EVERYTHING.

1677
01:39:57,583 --> 01:39:59,375
I WANT TO SHOW IT
THE WONDERFUL WORLD

1678
01:39:59,458 --> 01:40:02,500
THAT ITS MOM AND DAD
LIVED THEIR LIVES IN.

1679
01:40:03,125 --> 01:40:04,375
- ME, TOO.

1680
01:40:07,625 --> 01:40:12,625
- YOU KNOW, THE THING IS,
THERE IS A PLACE THAT
I REALLY WANT TO GO TO.

1681
01:40:12,708 --> 01:40:14,416
DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS?

1682
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:16,916
I KNOW IT'S STRANGE
BUT, TO TELL THE TRUTH,

1683
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,458
I ALWAYS WANTED TO
GO HOME TO WARSAWA.

1684
01:40:21,250 --> 01:40:24,875
I REALIZED THIS WORLD IS
SO FULL OF FEAR AND HATE.

1685
01:40:24,958 --> 01:40:27,583
AND I KNOW THAT
I'LL SUFFER IN THIS WORLD.

1686
01:40:27,666 --> 01:40:31,083
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I REALIZED THAT I DON'T MIND.

1687
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:37,375
EVEN IF I'M LOCKED UP
IN A DARK HOSPITAL ROOM
AND CAN ONLY GO OUT AT NIGHT.

1688
01:40:38,791 --> 01:40:41,833
EVEN IF I LIVE OUT
THE REST OF MY DAYS LIKE THAT,

1689
01:40:41,916 --> 01:40:43,916
THAT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT.

1690
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,708
BECAUSE I HAVE YOU
THERE, RENTON.

1691
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:50,083
THE CITY WHERE I MET YOU
AND GOT TO KNOW YOU

1692
01:40:50,166 --> 01:40:53,333
AND SPENT MY DAYS WITH YOU,
THAT'S MY FONDEST MEMORY.

1693
01:40:54,166 --> 01:40:55,500
MY PRECIOUS MEMORY.

1694
01:40:57,083 --> 01:41:00,333
BUT I DON'T MIND IF I LOSE THAT,
NOT ANYMORE.

1695
01:41:01,541 --> 01:41:04,333
IF THAT MEMORY
WILL INSPIRE THE EIZO,

1696
01:41:04,416 --> 01:41:06,750
IF IT WILL LET YOU SURVIVE,

1697
01:41:06,833 --> 01:41:10,708
THEN I DON'T MIND LOSING
WHAT MAKES ME ME.

1698
01:41:10,791 --> 01:41:14,750
BECAUSE IF YOU SURVIVE AND
JUST SIMPLY KEEP ON DREAMING,

1699
01:41:14,833 --> 01:41:17,416
THEN I'LL EXIST
IN YOUR DREAMS FOREVER.

1700
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:19,291
SO THAT IS MY DREAM.

1701
01:41:20,625 --> 01:41:24,333
NOW GOODBYE, SWEET RENTON.
I LOVE YOU.

1702
01:41:24,416 --> 01:41:26,375
I'LL BE SEEING YOU
IN YOUR DREAMS.

1703
01:41:27,958 --> 01:41:30,875
OKAY. LET'S GO, NIRVASH.

1704
01:41:30,958 --> 01:41:32,125
- ( squeaks )

1705
01:41:36,166 --> 01:41:38,708
- Operator: HAMMER OF GOD,
ENERGY DISCHARGE CONFIRMED!

1706
01:41:38,791 --> 01:41:41,291
PRIMARY MECHANISM
SHOWS ALL GREEN!

1707
01:41:41,375 --> 01:41:44,625
NO OBSTACLES DETECTED
ALONG PROJECTED PATH,
CORRIDOR 999!

1708
01:41:45,875 --> 01:41:47,750
NO REACTION IN EIZO CORE!

1709
01:41:47,833 --> 01:41:49,750
T-MINUS 27 SECONDS
TO BEAM IMPACT!

1710
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:56,750
UNKNOWN OBJECT DETECTED ON
BEAM CORRIDOR! SPEED, MACH 22!

1711
01:41:56,833 --> 01:41:58,541
IT'S PURSUING THE BEAM
AT HIGH SPEED!

1712
01:41:58,625 --> 01:42:00,583
- ( exclaims )
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

1713
01:42:16,083 --> 01:42:19,625
- Operator: SUCCESS!
HAMMER OF GOD HAS SCORED
A DIRECT HIT ON EIZO CORE!

1714
01:42:19,708 --> 01:42:22,000
OBSERVATION TEAMS, REPORT!

1715
01:42:22,083 --> 01:42:24,541
- EXCELLENT.
WELL DONE, EVERYONE.

1716
01:42:24,625 --> 01:42:26,625
AND NOW, THE SURVIVORS
WILL NEED TO BE--

1717
01:42:26,708 --> 01:42:28,833
- WAIT, WHAT'S THAT?

1718
01:42:31,083 --> 01:42:33,791
- ( kids giggling )

1719
01:42:33,875 --> 01:42:37,833
- OH, COME ON NOW. SLOW DOWN!
NOT SO FAST, I CAN'T KEEP UP...

1720
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,916
- HEY, SIS, WHAT'RE YOU
DOING THAT FOR?

1721
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,500
I'M MAKING A WISH
UPON THE STAR.

1722
01:42:52,583 --> 01:42:55,541
I'M WISHING FOR A PEACEFUL WORLD
TO COME TO US SOON.

1723
01:42:55,625 --> 01:42:57,083
- YEAH, ME, TOO!
- ME, TOO!

1724
01:43:02,375 --> 01:43:05,916
- NOT TO WORRY,
THE PEACE YOU WISH FOR
WILL COME SOON ENOUGH.

1725
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:09,125
SO LONG AS WE ALL
KEEP DREAMING OF THAT DAY.

1726
01:43:27,833 --> 01:43:29,916
( people clamoring )

1727
01:43:39,208 --> 01:43:40,708
- Operator: STORMS AND WAVES
THAT ARE OFF THE SCALE

1728
01:43:40,791 --> 01:43:42,625
ARE EMANATING
FROM THE EIZO CORE!

1729
01:43:42,708 --> 01:43:44,375
THE WORLD IS BEING FLOODED!

1730
01:43:44,458 --> 01:43:47,291
- Braya: IF THIS IS GOD'S REPLY
IT MEANS WE'RE NO MATCH

1731
01:43:47,375 --> 01:43:49,625
FOR POWERS
BEYOND UNDERSTANDING.

1732
01:43:49,708 --> 01:43:53,833
NO MATTER HOW MIGHTILY
WE MAY STRUGGLE OR FIGHT BACK.

1733
01:43:53,916 --> 01:43:55,958
BUT STILL, THIS SPECTACLE...

1734
01:43:56,041 --> 01:43:58,041
YOU PREDICTED
THIS WOULD HAPPEN, DIDN'T YOU?

1735
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:01,916
KODA, ARE YOU OUT THERE?

1736
01:44:03,750 --> 01:44:05,458
- Anemone: EVERYTHING
IS A DREAM.

1737
01:44:05,541 --> 01:44:07,708
- Koda: A DREAM?
- YES.

1738
01:44:07,791 --> 01:44:11,750
ALL INTELLIGENT LIFE FORMS
MUST DREAM IN ORDER FOR THEM
TO GROW AND EVOLVE.

1739
01:44:13,458 --> 01:44:17,041
SAY, DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS
YOU NEED IN ORDER TO DREAM?

1740
01:44:17,125 --> 01:44:20,500
- HOW PHILOSOPHICAL OF YOU.
I DON'T KNOW.

1741
01:44:20,583 --> 01:44:24,083
- IN ORDER TO DREAM,
YOU HAVE TO HAVE MEMORIES.

1742
01:44:24,166 --> 01:44:25,791
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT
WE EIZO SEEM TO LACK.

1743
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,500
ON THIS WORLD,
DREAMS ARE CREATED BY

1744
01:44:29,583 --> 01:44:32,791
THE GENETIC INFORMATION
THAT ALL LIFE POSSESSES.

1745
01:44:32,875 --> 01:44:35,291
MEMORIES OF THE PAST
THAT YOU ALL CARRY WITH YOU.

1746
01:44:35,375 --> 01:44:37,791
- THOSE MEMORIES ARE
WHAT YOUR PEOPLE WANTED?

1747
01:44:38,916 --> 01:44:42,583
TO WHAT END?
TO FUSE WITH HUMANITY?

1748
01:44:42,666 --> 01:44:44,125
- BEATS ME.

1749
01:44:44,208 --> 01:44:47,458
I'M JUST A SIMPLE OBSERVER
AND RECORDING DEVICE.

1750
01:44:47,541 --> 01:44:50,250
I'M NOT IN A POSITION
TO KNOW SUCH THINGS.

1751
01:44:50,333 --> 01:44:51,416
- I SEE.

1752
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:54,583
- YEAH BUT I WILL KNOW SOMEDAY!

1753
01:44:54,666 --> 01:44:58,291
WHEN MY PEOPLE, WHO HAVE
MANAGED TO BECOME ONE
WITH THIS WORLD,

1754
01:44:58,375 --> 01:45:01,791
RETURN FROM ACROSS
THAT VAST EMPTY SEA.

1755
01:45:01,875 --> 01:45:05,583
WHEN ALL LIFE ON
THIS CHANGING WORLD HAS
BECOME THE STUFF OF MYTHS,

1756
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:08,250
THAT'S WHEN I'LL KNOW.

1757
01:45:08,333 --> 01:45:10,041
- YOU'LL NEED
A GREAT DEAL OF PATIENCE.

1758
01:45:13,166 --> 01:45:17,625
SAY, WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE
THOSE CHILDREN
I WAS CHASING AFTER

1759
01:45:17,708 --> 01:45:19,791
ARE WATCHING ALL THIS UNFOLD?

1760
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:24,000
( exclaims )

1761
01:45:34,583 --> 01:45:35,708
- IT'S THE NEW MYTH.

1762
01:45:37,625 --> 01:45:39,208
IT'S THE NEW MYTH...

1763
01:45:39,291 --> 01:45:41,083
- Dominic: ...THAT WE'VE
ALL BEEN WANTING.

1764
01:45:41,166 --> 01:45:42,958
- DOMINIC, I LOVE YOU!

1765
01:45:43,041 --> 01:45:45,000
- NOW WE'LL BE TOGETHER FOREVER.

1766
01:45:56,458 --> 01:46:00,333
- OH, COME ON.
THE PAGES ARE ALL BLANK.

1767
01:46:00,416 --> 01:46:04,125
PUSHY GIRL. I TAKE IT
I'M TO FILL THEM IN?

1768
01:46:04,208 --> 01:46:07,833
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S FINE.
I ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE.

1769
01:46:07,916 --> 01:46:10,916
I SUPPOSE IT'S WHAT I
OUGHT TO DO SINCE I'M HERE.

1770
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:14,666
NO, IT'S SOMETHING
THAT ONLY I CAN DO.

1771
01:46:14,750 --> 01:46:17,708
SETTING DOWN IN WRITING
WHAT TRANSPIRED HERE

1772
01:46:17,791 --> 01:46:21,375
IS A GOOD WAY TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY YEARS.

1773
01:46:21,458 --> 01:46:25,791
SO THAT ONE DAY,
MY WORDS WILL BECOME
THE MYTHS OF THIS WORLD.

1774
01:46:25,875 --> 01:46:30,208
SO PERHAPS THE NEW MYTH
WILL PROVIDE REAL HOPE
FOR AN UNFOLDING FUTURE.

1775
01:47:00,208 --> 01:47:01,000
- WHERE AM I?

1776
01:47:04,291 --> 01:47:06,250
EUREKA! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1777
01:47:08,083 --> 01:47:09,541
UH, WAIT, I--

1778
01:47:11,083 --> 01:47:12,125
( gasp )

1779
01:47:20,833 --> 01:47:22,416
EUREKA.

1780
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:24,083
- ( babbles )

1781
01:47:24,166 --> 01:47:28,250
- YOU DID IT.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT. WHY EUREKA?

1782
01:47:28,333 --> 01:47:30,041
EUREKA!

1783
01:47:36,416 --> 01:47:37,458
NIRVASH!

1784
01:47:38,541 --> 01:47:40,291
- ( squeaks weekly )

1785
01:47:40,375 --> 01:47:42,083
- NIRVASH, YOU'RE SO...

1786
01:47:46,416 --> 01:47:48,833
( squeaks )

1787
01:47:48,916 --> 01:47:51,000
I SEE. SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

1788
01:47:51,083 --> 01:47:55,208
OH, NIRVASH.
WE'RE BACK, AREN'T WE?

1789
01:47:56,375 --> 01:47:57,583
- ( squeaks )

1790
01:47:57,666 --> 01:48:01,250
- YEAH, I CAN TELL.
THIS IS WARSAWA, ISN'T IT?

1791
01:48:01,333 --> 01:48:03,958
THIS PLACE THAT YOU BROUGHT ME
AND EUREKA BACK TO,

1792
01:48:05,291 --> 01:48:06,916
THIS IS OUR NEVERLAND.

1793
01:48:10,458 --> 01:48:12,125
EUREKA.

1794
01:48:13,250 --> 01:48:14,541
- ( squeaks )

1795
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:17,958
- IT'S TIME TO GO? GO WHERE?

1796
01:48:18,041 --> 01:48:20,833
- ( squeaks )
- TO JOIN THE OTHERS?

1797
01:48:22,041 --> 01:48:25,125
WAIT! I DON'T WANT
TO SAY GOODBYE!

1798
01:48:25,208 --> 01:48:27,416
DON'T GO! YOU CAN'T GO!

1799
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:29,458
PLEASE DON'T GO, NIRVASH!

1800
01:48:30,208 --> 01:48:31,416
- ( squeaks )

1801
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:39,166
( Space Rock playing )

1802
01:48:45,708 --> 01:48:48,500
THANK YOU. I'LL NEVER
FORGET YOU, NIRVASH.

1803
01:48:52,166 --> 01:48:55,583
NIRVASH SAID SOMETHING
BEFORE HE WENT AWAY.

1804
01:48:55,666 --> 01:49:00,000
HE SAID TO US,
"YOU TWO CAN FLY NOW,
EVEN WITHOUT WINGS."

1805
01:49:00,083 --> 01:49:03,166
HE SAID, "YOUR OWN TWO FEET
WILL CARRY YOU TO THE FUTURE."
