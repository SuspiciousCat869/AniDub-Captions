1
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,000
The year.

2
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,458
2148.

3
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,958
It was supposed to
have been a time of peace.

4
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:35,291
The Festum, our enemy
from far distant skies,

5
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:38,125
had been driven back after
humanity's decisive victory

6
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:40,208
in the battle
at the North Pole.

7
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,375
For most of us,

8
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:48,666
the end of the fighting
came as a welcome relief.

9
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,291
Still, amongst the world powers,
there were some who

10
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,250
could not be satisfied
until the enemy

11
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,541
had been wiped out completely.

12
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:36,250
And thus a new battle
was begun.

13
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:27,750
Heads up!

14
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:41,666
Alright, here we are.

15
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,375
Two Kazuki Curries.

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,208
Are we ready to order here?

17
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,458
Sure, uh.

18
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,250
Got an order up!

19
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,291
Two for Table B!

20
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,041
Got it.

21
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,208
Keep 'em coming!

22
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,583
That's two more
Kazuki Curry plates!

23
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,458
Mr. Mizoguchi, from
now on could you please

24
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,041
stop naming dishes after me?

25
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:06,916
Oh, gimme a break.

26
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,416
You're our main draw here, kid.

27
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,750
Another delivery order.

28
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,083
To Alvis again.

29
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,208
Huh?

30
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,500
Jeez, and we've still got
the festival tonight too.

31
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,166
This meeting will cover
the final checklist

32
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,625
for the school's annual U
Project, as well as the changes

33
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,000
to this year's Bone dance.

34
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,166
But first, there's something
we need to address.

35
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,208
I'll have a melon soda
and Kazuki Cake.

36
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,791
Lemon tea and a Kazuki Flan!

37
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,958
I'll have the Kazuki Curry
plate with green tea!

38
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,375
Slow down, not all at once.

39
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,833
We're really busy today,
you know.

40
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,250
Couldn't you do this at school?

41
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,625
Student Council always
holds official meetings here.

42
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,583
But Kondo's not even with you.

43
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:47,833
As the Vice President,

44
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,583
I have been entrusted
to run the proceedings.

45
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,041
Yeah, President Kondo's off
at the usual place again.

46
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,750
I've been handling
the secretary duties

47
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,541
to make sure
everything's organized.

48
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,333
That's pretty impressive,
don't you think, Maya?

49
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:01,583
Yes, Rina,
you're very responsible.

50
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,958
What about you, Akira?

51
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,458
Would you like something?

52
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,083
He'll have what I'm having.

53
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,041
Straight espresso, huh?

54
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,666
A bold choice.

55
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,458
You're a moron.

56
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,500
Did you want to order,
too, Chocolat?

57
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,250
Hey, Boss!

58
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,541
Are you ready, the festival
prep's already started!

59
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,250
I thought you weren't
gonna drink today.

60
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,708
Naaaaw.

61
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:41,958
Come on, Kenji.

62
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,625
This ain't drinkin'.

63
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,666
Still no Tamotsu.

64
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,208
The man's been drunk ever since
he finished work on the Fafners.

65
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,708
Perhaps, but it's thanks to
Mr. Kodate's work that we have

66
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,833
nine operational Nothung
Models ready to deploy.

67
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,583
Even Mark Fünf
is running perfectly,

68
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:00,041
and it was the most
heavily damaged of all.

69
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,833
The unit his son piloted.

70
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,750
He clearly put his heart
into those repairs.

71
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,500
Tsubaki Minashiro.

72
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:19,000
Hatred is not the way;
there must be another path.

73
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,958
Help him search for it.

74
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:21,916
I beg you.

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,458
Fumihiko.

76
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,333
Commander Makabe?

77
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,916
Hmm?

78
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,583
Systems operation proficiency

79
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,500
has also reached stipulated
values for all staff.

80
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:34,125
Former U.N. troops included.

81
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,791
Then we've determined the issue
is with the Brunhilde System.

82
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,375
That's correct.

83
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,791
Our core has entered her growth
stage, which means for a time,

84
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,666
she'll be drawing more energy.

85
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,916
Since the core also acts as our
environmental management system,

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,916
the resulting power drain
is likely to affect

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,291
the entire island.

88
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,000
Ecosystem, food supply,
disease rates, everything.

89
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:55,333
And meanwhile, we've been seeing
signs of activity from Solomon.

90
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,125
Destroying the Mir at
the North Pole should have

91
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,083
crippled their forces.

92
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,000
How can they be
on the move again?

93
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:05,583
It's possible that their Mir
has taken on a different form.

94
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:09,000
Perhaps in the same way our
Mir became the island's air.

95
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,291
But wouldn't that
require the enemy

96
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,250
to have a core similar to ours?

97
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,500
That's speculation.

98
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,375
We'll see what the
Solomon analysis tells us.

99
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,750
Until then.

100
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,291
We'll have to pray
this peace continues.

101
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,166
Ta-da!

102
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,000
Here's this morning's catch!

103
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:26,916
The saw-tooth stag beetle,
Miyama stag beetle,

104
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,458
and the Mulberry Borer!

105
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,583
We'll all be here
waiting for you, Tsubaki.

106
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:34,875
Hurry, okay?

107
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,041
I have so much to
tell you when you get back.

108
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,000
Finally, all done.

109
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,083
You still need
to get ready, don't you?

110
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,500
Why don't you
just head on home?

111
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:46,791
And what about you?

112
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,208
I should probably
wait here for Mr. Mizoguchi.

113
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:52,333
I'll be alright; I can still
see okay while it's light out.

114
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:55,833
'Kay, then.

115
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,291
Maya?

116
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,083
Thank you for--
Well, for everything.

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,416
It's alright; don't mention it.

118
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,041
I'll see you later.

119
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,958
The last glimmers
of hope have gone dark.

120
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:36,791
They are filled
with suffering and hatred.

121
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:40,166
I'm so sorry, Kazuki.

122
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,958
This is a gamble.

123
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,375
I'll tell you what
our last resort will be.

124
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,416
If anything should
go wrong, take Door Eleven.

125
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,416
Okay.

126
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,875
Thank you, Soshi.

127
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:58,000
I will return to you someday.

128
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,958
No matter what.

129
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,583
And I'll wait for you.

130
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,541
Right here.

131
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,333
As long as it takes.

132
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,541
Hey Kazuki.

133
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,541
Were you talkin' to yourself?

134
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,083
What?

135
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:08,833
No.

136
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:09,541
What?

137
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,833
Was I saying something?

138
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,416
'Kay, all done!

139
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,166
See?

140
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,500
It's the great big boat!

141
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,208
Oh, yes.

142
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,458
That's nice!

143
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,041
Good job, Miwa.

144
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,208
And there's another boat
that's even bigger!

145
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,791
And a mountain, too!

146
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,333
You don't say.

147
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,875
And what do they look like?

148
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,291
This one's got
a big thingy on top.

149
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,166
See?

150
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,125
And it's all white and shiny!

151
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,208
Miwa?

152
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,416
Come inside and change, sweetie.

153
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:42,916
No, please.

154
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,500
Please don't take my baby.

155
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,291
I'm begging you!

156
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,000
And see?

157
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,541
The great big boat
is coming to talk to us!

158
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:56,250
You ready?

159
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,000
Grandma already left.

160
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,083
I mean, you are coming,
aren't you?

161
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,041
Will you say something?

162
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,166
Say something!

163
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,208
 Fine, be that way!

164
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,708
You moron!

165
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,041
Hey, sorry I'm so late, Mom.

166
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,416
No, it's fine Canon.

167
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,541
I've laid out
your things for you.

168
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,250
Hey Sakura.

169
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:40,916
'Bout time.

170
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,333
Yeah, sorry.

171
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,583
Are you sure you should be
up on your feet like that?

172
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,166
I feel good today.

173
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,000
So I was thinking
I would try walking.

174
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,541
There's no need
to push too hard.

175
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,458
Come on.

176
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,000
I'll getcha there.

177
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,125
Fine.

178
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:56,916
Whoa.

179
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,333
Hey, are you gaining weight?

180
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,166
That's it.

181
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:02,750
I'm walking.

182
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:03,458
Hey!

183
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,250
C'mon, I didn't mean it!

184
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,041
It was a joke!

185
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:05,750
Funny!

186
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:06,958
Ha ha!

187
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,166
Now isn't that just lovely.

188
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,458
Yeah, Tamotsu was
in charge of the set-up.

189
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,833
Festival lanterns are
riding out on the tide.

190
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,375
They're partially
lifting the shield.

191
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,958
It really is a
beautiful tradition, isn't it?

192
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:03,416
I only hope our names will be
recorded like that one day.

193
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,083
Uh- Unknown object
detected inside our shield!

194
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:08,458
Wait.

195
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:09,625
What?

196
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,041
There!

197
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,541
It's coming from the west!

198
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,166
This is a gamble, Kazuki.

199
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:29,583
Kazuki?

200
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,208
What's he doing?

201
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,416
He can barely see!

202
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,000
Kazuki!

203
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,041
Wait!

204
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,666
No girls, it's not safe!

205
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,083
Stay back!

206
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,666
Soshi!

207
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,375
What did you say?

208
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,416
Hold on, is that--
Is that a Core?

209
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,416
Right, "Take Door Eleven".

210
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,291
Where are you going?

211
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,125
Data verified.

212
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:47,208
Neo U.N. B-29 military
transport submarine.

213
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,291
Zero response to our scan.

214
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:53,875
'Kay.

215
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,500
Whadda we got here?

216
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,541
"Kurusu", huh?

217
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,083
What the hell's going on?

218
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,500
Alright, I'll do it.

219
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,291
If that's what you want.

220
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,666
Soshi.

221
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,000
An aurora?

222
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,375
But what could be causing it?

223
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,958
Look, there.

224
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,375
They're on standby?

225
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,458
You don't think--

226
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,041
It's a Festum.

227
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,458
Are you there?

228
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,166
Are you there?

229
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,750
Enemy confirmed:
Sphinx type A.

230
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,250
I want all Fafners on standby!

231
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,208
The Brunhilde System
is not responding!

232
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,125
We're losing the shield.

233
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,083
Breach imminent!

234
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,541
Did they deliberately target
the Core's growth stage?

235
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,291
Mark Sein standing by
to sortie!

236
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,708
Is that Kazuki?

237
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,583
The enemy has reached the
Tatsumiya Island mainland!

238
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,625
Go, Mark Sein!

239
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:17,750
Launch now!

240
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,083
Opening Neidhöle
gates one through six.

241
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,875
Mark Sein, clear for launch.

242
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,375
Why?

243
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,625
Why is it you?

244
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,625
Why isn't it Soshi?

245
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,416
A new Festum?

246
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,833
Gimme a break.

247
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,958
Since when do the Festum
use human weaponry?

248
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,916
It's displaying a completely
different chemical profile!

249
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,208
Pilot is experiencing
rapid assimilation!

250
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:24,416
Send reinforcements!

251
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,875
All Fafners-- 

252
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,166
Commander Makabe?

253
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,208
It's still alive.

254
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,166
It's right on top a' me!

255
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,833
Eat this!

256
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,291
The enemy has been terminated.

257
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,000
Hey, it's alright.

258
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,083
You just keep still and rest.

259
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,250
But the siren.

260
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,125
No, it's not an attack.

261
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:36,208
They're moving the island.

262
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,166
Shield in place.

263
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,041
Disengaging camouflage mirror.

264
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,333
Entering course data.

265
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:43,208
T-minus two minutes
to autopilot engage.

266
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,166
The Com is open, sir.

267
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,666
May I have your
attention, please.

268
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,125
Tatsumiya Island will
soon leave her moorings,

269
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,375
as we attempt to distance
ourselves from the phenomenon

270
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,958
in the skies.

271
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,541
Effective immediately, we
will maintain our war footing

272
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,833
to prepare for
further enemy attacks.

273
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,791
Oh, please, no.

274
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,916
I'll be counting on every
one of you to do your part.

275
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,625
Listen up.

276
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,333
When you're piloting a Fafner,
don't think about it;

277
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,541
just move naturally.

278
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,166
Be one with your machine.

279
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,666
In body and mind.

280
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,541
And accept that you are not
the same in here as outside.

281
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,708
Hey, are you paying
attention, Mark Fünf?

282
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,416
Yes, sir!

283
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,333
We all go by
our unit names here.

284
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:38,458
You are your Fafners now,
and the Fafners are you.

285
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,416
You think you got
all that, Mark Neun?

286
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,041
Oh.

287
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:42,541
Uh.

288
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,041
Roger.

289
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,333
Mark Zehn?

290
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,208
Uh, right.

291
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:54,000
Mark Zehn--
reporting-- ma'am.

292
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,333
He's talking?

293
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,291
Can you-- hear me?

294
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,041
Mhmm.

295
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,541
Loud and clear.

296
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,250
No way.

297
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,708
Zwölf, you ready?

298
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,875
Akira did--
Did you just speak?

299
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:09,958
Mark Zwölf.

300
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,333
Respond.

301
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:12,583
Roger!

302
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,708
Now, maintain your
crossing with each other.

303
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,541
Shoulder any pain
or fear you feel as a team.

304
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:18,583
And don't forget.

305
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:19,916
The longer you pilot,

306
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,208
the more you've gotta
worry about assimilation.

307
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,625
But hey, unlike in the past,

308
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:26,416
at least your Fafner shouldn't
just stop moving on you.

309
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,208
Got it?

310
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:28,750
Then let's do this!

311
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Pilot aptitude scores
are all in line.

312
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,375
I'll use these new tests

313
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:35,416
to determine the most
suitable equipment for her.

314
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,875
This feels so good!

315
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,166
Sakura.

316
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,666
Why would you choose
this for yourself?

317
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,583
You gonna be okay?

318
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:48,041
I never thought I would have
to worry like this again.

319
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:50,750
Hey Mom!

320
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,625
Don't forget, here I'm an
officer and instructor first.

321
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,041
Of course, Ms. Hazama.

322
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,041
I'm sorry about that.

323
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,250
Now let me show you
why I called you.

324
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:02,500
The thirteenth unit:
Mark Dreizehn.

325
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:04,916
You'll be the first pilot
ever assigned to it;

326
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
we've had it configured
especially for you.

327
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,916
A machine of my very own.

328
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:16,916
Seriously?

329
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,916
Who attacks by head-butting?

330
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,333
Maybe a result of her
altered consciousness?

331
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:24,375
Well, if so, she'll need some
equipment I didn't plan on.

332
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:27,916
So he's crossing over.

333
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,458
That's correct.

334
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,375
Based on these latest tests,
I've determined that Kazuki

335
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:33,291
is in a continuous
state of crossing.

336
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:36,125
So what you're saying is
that he's still connected to

337
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:39,916
Soshi Minamiro and most likely
has been for the last two years.

338
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Yes?

339
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,458
We're not sure
who's on the other end.

340
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:44,625
All we can say for certain
is this appears to be linked

341
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,333
with a different heavy strain.

342
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:47,750
A different strain, huh?

343
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,458
Does that have
something to do with Sein?

344
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:50,791
That's my guess.

345
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,750
The thing's a walking
assimilation phenomenon.

346
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:56,583
And Kazuki is the only pilot
that can even handle it.

347
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:59,041
We cannot let him get back
into that machine.

348
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,583
It's obviously killing him;

349
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:03,333
it's a miracle he hasn't
been assimilated already.

350
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:06,875
What of this unmanned ship?

351
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:10,250
We've finished analyzing the
entity we discovered aboard.

352
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,916
Solomon confirmed
that it's a Sphinx type.

353
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:17,916
Its body composition closely
resembles a Core type,

354
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,541
but it has no chromosomes.

355
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,125
It's clearly attempting
to mimic a human.

356
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:24,291
Does that mean it's
the same as the enemy

357
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,583
that attacked the island?

358
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,833
There are no abnormalities
in the ship itself.

359
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:29,458
And according to
the autopilot record,

360
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:31,166
it was coming straight for us.

361
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,291
So in other words,
someone sent it here.

362
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:37,458
Most of the data we recovered
involved the Neo U.N's analysis

363
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:39,208
of a new type of Festum.

364
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,166
It has powerful
assimilation abilities,

365
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,750
and employs weapons
modeled after ours.

366
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:45,375
They named it the "Eurus" type,

367
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:48,416
after a mythological god
who summoned storms.

368
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,791
So what the hell
are they saying?

369
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:52,416
"You're gonna be fighting
these, now study up"?

370
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
We also discovered
this bit of data.

371
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,333
It's a recommendation
that we publicly disclose

372
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:02,166
SC Code-level intel
to this unidentified craft.

373
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,625
SC code.

374
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:06,041
It's telling us to disclose
info on our island's core

375
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:07,375
or the Mir to someone?

376
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:10,541
Or, more precisely,
on something akin to a Mir.

377
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:12,583
Do we know what
it's referring to?

378
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:14,000
Not at this time.

379
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:16,166
I can only assume that
was unknown to whoever created

380
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,666
this data, as well.

381
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,375
The phenomenon in our skies,

382
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:22,208
the enemy attack,
and the auto-piloted ship.

383
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:25,291
Right now, we have to figure out
how these things are connected.

384
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:29,625
I didn't think President Kondo
would be so weak.

385
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:30,500
He's not.

386
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:31,750
I think he lost on purpose,

387
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:34,541
as a way to help
build up our confidence.

388
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:35,833
This is so weird.

389
00:25:35,916 --> 00:25:37,416
You're talking again.

390
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,000
I guess, I always knew I'd be
able to if I piloted a Fafner.

391
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:43,416
I want to be assigned to the
one Mom and Dad were piloting

392
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,708
when they disappeared.

393
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:48,083
The Zero Fafner.

394
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:50,625
You'll just get in the way no
matter what unit you're in.

395
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:51,500
I'll do it.

396
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,458
You should resign.

397
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:56,083
Stop it, Rina, you know
that isn't going to happen.

398
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:58,875
Here's what I know.

399
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:01,500
You're just a moron who
only thinks about himself!

400
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:16,166
Ah.

401
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,583
Man, that hurts.

402
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:18,625
Well you were a good sport,

403
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:20,416
taking one for
the team out there.

404
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,583
How'd it go?

405
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:23,625
None of them help each other.

406
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,375
They'll get themselves
killed like that.

407
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,750
Then we'll just have
to make sure they don't.

408
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:29,416
You know.

409
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,708
You really don't have to--

410
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:31,875
Yes I do.

411
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,333
I'm still a pilot, Kenji.

412
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:36,000
Besides, you already spend
so much time looking after

413
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:37,541
me and Mr. Kodate.

414
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:39,500
I think you've got
enough to worry about.

415
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:40,750
Hey, c'mon.

416
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,666
It isn't like it's any trouble.

417
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,750
You realize that it wasn't your
fault that Mamoru got killed.

418
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:48,583
And what happened to me
isn't anyone's fault, either.

419
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:53,125
Still, I do understand
why you feel responsible.

420
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:54,375
And so--

421
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:02,083
That's why I'm asking you
to let me share the burden.

422
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:05,458
I will not lose you.

423
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:06,750
I'm not going anywhere.

424
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:07,791
Then promise!

425
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:09,958
Promise you'll live,
no matter what!

426
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:15,875
Then this must be
what's causing my symptoms.

427
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:18,500
But I was exposed
to nuclear fallout, what--

428
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:20,291
Thirty years ago?

429
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:22,458
The island's Mir has been
suppressing your illness

430
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:23,833
all this time.

431
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:26,125
But after this latest
enemy attack, with our core

432
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:28,750
still in its growth stage,
it's severely weakened

433
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:30,500
its biosphere functions.

434
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:34,166
Perhaps when the core
finishes its growth then-- No!

435
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:38,125
I'll find a way to cure you even
before that, whatever it takes!

436
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:41,125
So the island has
allowed me to live.

437
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:43,666
It seems that
I've been truly blessed.

438
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:14,333
Air strikes and naval strikes.

439
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:16,708
They must be clearing
the way for a landing force.

440
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:19,833
So they're attacking
like humans would.

441
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:22,416
In that case,
let's show them how it's done.

442
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,541
Bastards.

443
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:24,708
Roger.

444
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:26,541
Reinforcement Fafners
prepare to sortie.

445
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:28,875
Nibeloong System now active.

446
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:31,375
Siegfried System
connections are stable.

447
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:33,083
Auto-calibration
sequence initiated.

448
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,666
Goubain!

449
00:28:59,416 --> 00:29:00,916
They're beautiful.

450
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:11,750
I'm alive?

451
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,916
You're in a Nothung model,
it can take it.

452
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,833
That's what it was
designed to do, you know.

453
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:17,833
It's coming!

454
00:29:17,916 --> 00:29:18,875
So hold it off!

455
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:38,125
No, no, no, no!

456
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:43,666
You're gonna be all right.

457
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,083
Just calm down.

458
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:59,041
Your Fafner's Mir core
resists the enemy's power!

459
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:00,875
Be quick, and they
can't touch you!

460
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,458
Believe in yourself, be one
with your machine, and fight!

461
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:27,250
One's breaking away, you guys!

462
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:28,458
Everybody look sharp!

463
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:29,750
'Kay, I'm on it.

464
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,791
Wha?

465
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:07,000
Is it-- Is it trying
to say something?

466
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:20,291
Nice work out there.

467
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:21,375
Keep it up, Mark Zehn.

468
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:22,625
Right!

469
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,500
He's about to wake up.

470
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:38,250
Solomon's responding!

471
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:40,708
There's a Festum inside Alvis!

472
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:42,875
It seems our guest has awakened.

473
00:32:04,791 --> 00:32:06,791
So this is air.

474
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:11,750
Life.

475
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:29,500
The pain is multiplying.

476
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:32,333
It's sad.

477
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,125
Tears.

478
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:43,916
Please go home, everyone.

479
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,208
Give me some time
to talk to them.

480
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:52,625
The enemy is retreating?

481
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:56,416
Wait.

482
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,791
What just happened?

483
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:58,958
Did we win?

484
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:00,875
We-- We won?

485
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:02,083
Hell yeah!

486
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,625
They'll be back soon.

487
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:12,250
I advise surrender.

488
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:13,333
Kazuki.

489
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:14,416
Who are you?

490
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,291
And how do you know my name?

491
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,791
Kazuki!

492
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:25,083
What is this strange creature?

493
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:26,375
Help me, please!

494
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:33,250
I told you not
to charge off on your own!

495
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:35,458
Somebody's gonna get
taken out because of you!

496
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:36,541
You can't stop me!

497
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:38,500
I'm gonna fight
just like Mamoru did!

498
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,125
I swear.

499
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:44,166
I think that poor thing was
trying to tell me something.

500
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,291
It was awful!

501
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:47,333
Almost like it was
begging me for help!

502
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:49,833
And so what if it was,
it's still the enemy, right?

503
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:51,875
They're trying to kill
all of us, remember?

504
00:33:51,958 --> 00:33:53,750
Just take 'em out;
that'll shut 'em up.

505
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:56,083
But I know Tsubaki
would want me to listen!

506
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:58,458
Tsubaki's gone, so get over it!

507
00:33:58,541 --> 00:33:59,583
No.

508
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:01,333
How could you say
something like that?

509
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:05,833
What's with them?

510
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:07,666
They're all acting crazy.

511
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:10,333
It's their first fight; they're
just a little bit on edge.

512
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:12,625
Not me; I took out
four 'a those things!

513
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:14,041
I probably could'a
gotten a hundred

514
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:15,583
or so if they hadn't run away.

515
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:17,041
Uh huh.

516
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:18,541
Hey.

517
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:19,833
Maybe there'll be even more
of 'em next time, you think?

518
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:21,708
Would that be your idea of fun?

519
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,333
Suck it, Kenji!

520
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:25,833
I'm tougher than
you'll ever be!

521
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:29,708
Such enthusiasm.

522
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:32,291
I am so tearing them
all new ones when we get back.

523
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:33,958
No, we'll say they did great.

524
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:35,791
Y'know, "carrot and stick".

525
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:38,000
Assuming the fight
is really over.

526
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:39,625
They haven't called us in yet.

527
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:41,750
Something isn't right.

528
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:46,041
You may refer to me as,
Misao Kurusu.

529
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,708
 Wait, isn't that--?

530
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:50,916
I can't believe
he's broadcasting this

531
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,666
to the whole island.

532
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,375
Shouldn't he be worried about
causing some kind of riot?

533
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:57,291
That's always been
Commander Fumihiko's style;

534
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:59,500
he's free with
information to a fault.

535
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:03,000
But much as I hate to admit it,
it's pretty damn effective.

536
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:04,666
"Misao Kurusu".

537
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,791
Is that the name of
a human you assimilated?

538
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:08,250
I chose it.

539
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:10,500
Based on Soshi Minashiro's
knowledge of your language,

540
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:13,875
these words seemed a suitable
way to identify my existence.

541
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:16,875
I needed a name to speak
with your kind, did I not?

542
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:19,875
And was it Soshi Minashiro
that put you on that boat?

543
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:21,583
No, that was my own desire.

544
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:24,708
However, he did want you
to have certain information.

545
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:27,291
You found his words
on the boat, correct?

546
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,166
You're telling me that data
came directly from Soshi?

547
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,208
Why doesn't he come
to the island himself?

548
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:34,041
It is because
of the great fire.

549
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:36,708
A fire that was
ignited by you humans.

550
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:39,708
It has caused much
suffering amongst my kind.

551
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:42,250
You mean the nuclear
strike by the Neo U.N?

552
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:43,500
Correct.

553
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:45,541
The pain of the initial
shock was unbearable,

554
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:48,916
so much so that our Mir
did not wish to be reborn.

555
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,250
Though perhaps that is why I
was allowed to be born instead?

556
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:53,541
What do you mean?

557
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:55,583
Did your Mir survive
the attack and now exists

558
00:35:55,666 --> 00:35:56,666
in a different form?

559
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,375
Is he feeling alright?

560
00:35:58,458 --> 00:36:00,250
Why's he grabbing
his chest like that?

561
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:01,708
Yes.

562
00:36:01,791 --> 00:36:04,791
Mir split into pieces, but
did not disappear entirely.

563
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:07,666
Will you please answer
a question for me now?

564
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,791
Within reason, yes.

565
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:12,583
Then tell me, have you ever
looked up into the sky

566
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:14,333
and thought it beautiful?

567
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:15,958
 The sky?

568
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:17,625
I suppose.

569
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,958
 I knew it!

570
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:22,625
I really can
understand your kind!

571
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:23,708
And what?

572
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:25,875
You somehow find
this thought surprising?

573
00:36:25,958 --> 00:36:28,208
You have the power to read
our thoughts, do you not?

574
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:29,416
We certainly do.

575
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,416
But it's often hard
to make sense of them.

576
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,750
Which is why I'm happy

577
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:35,541
to know that you think
the sky is beautiful, too!

578
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:37,916
And what is it
you're after, exactly?

579
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,125
I want to make
the fighting stop.

580
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:42,125
I don't want
the pain to multiply.

581
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:44,208
Are you saying
you've come seeking peace?

582
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:45,416
Yes.

583
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,958
Specifically, I wish
to assimilate your Core.

584
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:49,000
Excuse me?

585
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:50,750
Is this not
a reasonable request?

586
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,708
It would allow our Mir
to assimilate your Mir without

587
00:36:52,791 --> 00:36:55,125
any further fighting.

588
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:57,708
After all, it was Tatsumiya
Island that gave us pain

589
00:36:57,791 --> 00:36:59,250
and fear of death.

590
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:02,416
So what you want is to erase
your pain, and us along with it.

591
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,958
I don't want to erase you.

592
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:05,666
I want to join forces.

593
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,791
"Join forces"?

594
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:07,625
Against whom?

595
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:08,625
Other humans.

596
00:37:08,708 --> 00:37:10,208
Other groups of my kind.

597
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:12,125
We'll take away
everyone's ability to fight,

598
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:14,333
so that they can't anymore.

599
00:37:14,416 --> 00:37:17,333
And once we have succeeded,
then everyone will have peace.

600
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:20,208
Do you expect me to respond
to this immediately?

601
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:22,291
I'm prepared to wait.

602
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:24,666
I know your people
make decisions as a group.

603
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,250
But I hope you hurry.

604
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:28,916
The others will not stay gone
for much longer and your Core

605
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,791
will not survive another attack.

606
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,333
How do you know this?

607
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:36,291
I know because our Mir
has already stolen your sky.

608
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:38,625
And the Core
will die without it.

609
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:41,458
Although, it looks like
you might die even sooner.

610
00:37:42,916 --> 00:37:45,791
Will you agree to remain right
here until I'm able to return?

611
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:46,916
Of course.

612
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Then did you have
any other questions?

613
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:54,083
What is this "Kazuki Curry"?

614
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:56,083
You heard his offer.

615
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:58,375
He wishes to form
an alliance with us.

616
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:01,791
Whether or not it's genuine,
this is an unprecedented move.

617
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:03,125
It's also a sure-fire way

618
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:05,291
to turn the rest of
the world against us.

619
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:06,541
The kid said that

620
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:08,541
we'd be joinin' up to
fight other Festum, too.

621
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:10,791
So does that mean all these
special "Eurus-types"

622
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:12,708
or whatever they're
called have somehow split off

623
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,208
into their own group?

624
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:16,791
It does suggest that the enemy
has divided into factions.

625
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:19,250
How much of what
he said is true, though?

626
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,750
We can't verify
that data came from Soshi.

627
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:23,583
All we have's
his word for it.

628
00:38:23,666 --> 00:38:25,666
We can't ignore the
possibility that this is all

629
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:29,458
an elaborate ruse to trick us
into divulging our SC Code.

630
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:31,791
Clearly, the part about the
enemy causing the phenomenon

631
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:33,291
in our skies was true.

632
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:36,083
But the assertion that these
aurora are killing our Core?

633
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:37,333
Also true.

634
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:38,708
Unfortunately.

635
00:38:38,791 --> 00:38:40,958
And if the strain is
compounded by further attacks,

636
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:44,583
catastrophic failure
becomes even more likely.

637
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:47,458
We need to put this decision
before the whole island.

638
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,208
They're trying to
return to the soil?

639
00:38:58,291 --> 00:39:02,166
Festum's bodies are made
of silicon--so they are soil.

640
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:05,125
They're just looking for a place
to come home to, same as us.

641
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:06,250
Akane!

642
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:08,750
I finally found
my home, you know.

643
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:11,333
Even if I did lose it
for a while.

644
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:13,666
And it's wherever I'm with you.

645
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:17,708
Have you told Mr. Mizoguchi
that you're sick?

646
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:18,875
I have.

647
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:20,375
So how did you find out?

648
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:21,916
Maya told me that you
looked like you weren't

649
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,416
feeling too well.

650
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,916
Right, I'm sorry.

651
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,791
You don't have to apologize.

652
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:30,166
We'll protect the island, Dad.

653
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:33,375
So you can, you know,
try and take it easy.

654
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:34,916
And what might that entail?

655
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,791
I dunno, maybe living here
with-- Well, with Dr. Tomi.

656
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:40,291
Huh?

657
00:39:41,666 --> 00:39:43,916
Hey, c'mon, I'm just
trying to help!

658
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,416
And where would
that leave you, then?

659
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,333
Huh?

660
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:47,875
There're places I can go.

661
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:50,041
Like where,
the cockpit of Mark Sein?

662
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:52,750
Yeah, sure I guess, I mean
if that's what I need to do.

663
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:54,750
Lemme tell you what I want.

664
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:57,833
I want this house to be a place
that you will always able

665
00:39:57,916 --> 00:39:59,125
to come home to.

666
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:03,500
I can't leave the island
to you just yet.

667
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:04,750
I'm sorry, son.

668
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:08,666
Well, like I said, I was
just trying to help out.

669
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:11,083
So this "Misao Kurusu".

670
00:40:11,166 --> 00:40:12,250
What do you make of him?

671
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:13,458
I don't know.

672
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:14,958
He is still an enemy.

673
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:16,708
But the way he came to us.

674
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:20,166
I just feel like Soshi's
gambling something on him.

675
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:22,625
Soshi sent that boat to
the island because he believed

676
00:40:22,708 --> 00:40:24,458
doing so would protect us.

677
00:40:24,541 --> 00:40:25,958
Is that the sense
you're getting?

678
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:28,916
I don't know how I know.

679
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,750
I just do somehow.

680
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:33,291
Not every war is won
on the battlefield.

681
00:40:34,916 --> 00:40:37,500
Now go have a dialogue
with that creature.

682
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:38,875
If you're right,

683
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:41,000
perhaps you can find another
way to save this island.

684
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:02,916
What is this?

685
00:41:04,583 --> 00:41:05,333
Go!

686
00:41:05,416 --> 00:41:06,791
Just take the bastards down!

687
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,833
Hang on, they're
protecting each other?

688
00:41:17,916 --> 00:41:19,000
Whoa!

689
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:26,791
Mark Zehn, no!

690
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:33,791
Let's take out their shields.

691
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:34,875
Roger that.

692
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,875
You and Soshi are here.

693
00:41:49,958 --> 00:41:51,750
I've so wanted to see it.

694
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:54,500
The place Soshi Minashiro lived.

695
00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:56,833
I want to understand him more.

696
00:41:56,916 --> 00:42:00,291
So is that why you're
wearing Soshi's uniform?

697
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:02,083
I wore it because it fits.

698
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:04,250
What about Soshi, where is he?

699
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:05,791
He's nowhere.

700
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:08,875
But his existence
has not yet been lost.

701
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:09,958
So what else?

702
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:12,291
I'm very happy
we can talk like this.

703
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:15,583
Everyone on this island
is suffering because of you.

704
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:18,333
You do not get to act
like we're friends.

705
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:21,375
Are you feeling
hatred for me, Kazuki?

706
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:24,458
No, I-- I'm just angry,
that's all.

707
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:27,750
It seems I don't really
understand anger or hatred.

708
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:29,625
But if you don't
want your people to suffer,

709
00:42:29,708 --> 00:42:31,708
then just do what I say.

710
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:34,041
If you want our Core,
why not take it?

711
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:36,750
Because I have no desire
to fight with you.

712
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:39,083
Then stop your Mir
from attacking us!

713
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:40,500
That's impossible.

714
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:42,458
I don't have
that kind of power.

715
00:42:42,541 --> 00:42:43,833
You did it once!

716
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:46,833
I requested that the others
go home to give us time.

717
00:42:46,916 --> 00:42:49,666
My existence is--
Well, you might say

718
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:52,166
it's analogous to one
of your fingers.

719
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,000
Your fingers don't
give your body orders.

720
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:57,041
Now do they.

721
00:42:57,125 --> 00:42:58,708
So where is "home"?

722
00:42:58,791 --> 00:42:59,708
The ship.

723
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:01,291
It's like my island.

724
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,291
And is that where your Mir
is located, aboard that ship?

725
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:06,791
Yes, it is.

726
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,916
And you have just thought about
attacking it, haven't you.

727
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,291
If that's what it takes
to save our island, yes.

728
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:14,041
Is that what Soshi Minashiro
has told you to do?

729
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:15,125
What do you mean?

730
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:19,208
Can you still
hear Soshi's voice?

731
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:20,958
I can't anymore.

732
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:22,458
It takes everything
I have just

733
00:43:22,541 --> 00:43:25,916
to make sure his existence
doesn't disappear completely!

734
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,916
That was you.

735
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,875
You protected Soshi.

736
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:54,291
Now!

737
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:55,458
Finish it off!

738
00:43:58,333 --> 00:43:59,875
Enemy kill is confirmed!

739
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:02,500
Whatever these latest enemies
have been dropping on us,

740
00:44:02,583 --> 00:44:05,958
it seems designed to put
maximum strain on our system.

741
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:09,041
They're using
"Core Killers", huh?

742
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:11,583
Let her talk to them, Fumihiko.

743
00:44:12,875 --> 00:44:14,958
You can create a path together.

744
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:16,541
Let her try.

745
00:44:16,625 --> 00:44:18,291
"Her" who?

746
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:20,791
Commander!

747
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:24,583
So the SC Code.

748
00:44:24,666 --> 00:44:27,458
Life being allowed
by the island.

749
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:30,041
And an existence akin to Mir.

750
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,791
Ms. Kaname?

751
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:34,208
I'll be okay.

752
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:36,166
Just feeling a little dizzy.

753
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,458
Mom!

754
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:40,666
Someone get the medical team
over here, hurry!

755
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,125
On it!

756
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:44,291
Medical Team
to the hanger, stat!

757
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,833
The past Mir,
nuclear contamination.

758
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:48,750
At this rate.

759
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:49,916
I predict that most of

760
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,458
the islanders will
become symptomatic soon.

761
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:55,500
This medicine aids
Pilot/Fafner integration.

762
00:44:55,583 --> 00:44:59,166
It deliberately accelerates
the assimilation process.

763
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,000
It's our last option.

764
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:04,000
I don't have any other way
to suppress your symptoms.

765
00:45:04,083 --> 00:45:05,125
I know the risks.

766
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:06,291
It's alright.

767
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:09,708
I just can't help thinking.

768
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:12,333
Maybe we should take
our chances with the Festum

769
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:14,208
and do what he says.

770
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:18,208
I know it's wrong,
but if it means you can live!

771
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:24,125
We haven't run out
of hope just yet.

772
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:26,250
Let's follow the
guidance of our core.

773
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:27,958
We'll see where that leads us.

774
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,666
We're going to live at Alvis?

775
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:31,916
Just for a little while.

776
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,083
Until it's safe to come back.

777
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:35,875
Yeah okay, I guess.

778
00:45:35,958 --> 00:45:38,333
But why do I have to go
to the hospital, Mom?

779
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:40,125
I don't feel hurt anywhere.

780
00:45:40,208 --> 00:45:41,791
I don't know, sweetie.

781
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,041
Why would you want
to save Soshi?

782
00:45:58,125 --> 00:46:00,583
I had been looking forever.

783
00:46:00,666 --> 00:46:04,125
For another existence who
thought the sky was beautiful.

784
00:46:04,208 --> 00:46:05,791
And suddenly there he was.

785
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:07,916
So you decided
that for yourself?

786
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,791
That the sky is beautiful?

787
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:10,833
Yes.

788
00:46:10,916 --> 00:46:12,500
Don't you think that, too?

789
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:16,083
I can't see the sky anymore.

790
00:46:16,166 --> 00:46:18,666
And soon I won't be able
to see anything at all.

791
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,625
I just have to go by feel,

792
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:23,666
so my fingers have
to become my eyes now.

793
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:27,875
I've asked myself,
over and over again,

794
00:46:27,958 --> 00:46:31,333
what it could be that
Soshi wants from you.

795
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:32,625
I don't know.

796
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:34,041
But my guess is that
there are things he hopes

797
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,875
you'll go back
and tell your Mir.

798
00:46:35,958 --> 00:46:37,041
"Tell my Mir"?

799
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:38,416
Things like what?

800
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,625
That you can't
find peace this way.

801
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:44,583
Blaming humans for all of your
suffering isn't the answer.

802
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:47,166
Erasing us won't
erase your pain.

803
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:49,125
But I told you
I don't want that!

804
00:46:49,208 --> 00:46:51,333
That's why I gave
your people a choice!

805
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:53,416
You're the one
who has to choose!

806
00:46:58,125 --> 00:47:01,250
You can decide,
"Are you there?"

807
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:09,250
Seri!

808
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:10,333
You okay?

809
00:47:10,416 --> 00:47:12,125
I finally figured it out.

810
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:13,916
What it is they're saying.

811
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,833
The Festum?

812
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,791
"Help me. Stop the pain."

813
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:21,916
Help me to stop the pain!

814
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,541
Fine, then we put 'em
outta their misery!

815
00:47:29,583 --> 00:47:30,416
 Hey.

816
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:30,875
Come on.

817
00:47:30,958 --> 00:47:32,166
Don't cry!

818
00:47:35,166 --> 00:47:37,500
I want to see
a blue sky again!

819
00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:44,916
All of my information is
already being passed on to Mir.

820
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,583
What more could
I possibly tell?

821
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:49,541
Have you told your
Mir your feelings?

822
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:51,166
That you don't want to fight?

823
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:52,500
I can't.

824
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:56,083
To me, Mir is like what
your people call a "god".

825
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:59,458
You can't defy
the will of God, can you?

826
00:47:59,541 --> 00:48:00,458
So please.

827
00:48:00,541 --> 00:48:02,583
Please, just do what I ask.

828
00:48:02,666 --> 00:48:04,750
But we don't want
to fight with other humans.

829
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:06,000
So how can you expect us

830
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:08,666
to agree to fight
the entire world with you?

831
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:12,541
If I did that,
I wouldn't be me anymore.

832
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:14,333
And likewise.

833
00:48:14,416 --> 00:48:16,125
If I did as you suggest,

834
00:48:16,208 --> 00:48:18,583
I wouldn't be me
anymore, either.

835
00:48:34,208 --> 00:48:36,291
You surprise me.

836
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:39,208
I've known people who wanted
to talk with the enemy before.

837
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:42,166
But you're the first I've seen
who's made graves for them.

838
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:45,333
Tsubaki tried to tell the
Festum how sad we all felt.

839
00:48:45,416 --> 00:48:48,208
And now they're suffering, too.

840
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:50,583
I dunno, I just
felt sorry for them.

841
00:48:51,916 --> 00:48:53,333
Guess that's pretty strange.

842
00:48:53,416 --> 00:48:54,583
You can say it.

843
00:48:54,666 --> 00:48:56,000
No.

844
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:58,958
Just as we remember the
friends we've lost in battle,

845
00:48:59,041 --> 00:49:01,708
we should never
forget our fallen foes.

846
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:03,208
The cost of war.

847
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:06,541
I can't imagine.

848
00:49:06,625 --> 00:49:10,125
You've had to fight humans
before, haven't you?

849
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:11,708
I have.

850
00:49:11,791 --> 00:49:14,375
Is there something you
came here to ask me?

851
00:49:14,458 --> 00:49:15,500
Yes.

852
00:49:15,583 --> 00:49:18,375
Something I believe
only you can do.

853
00:49:27,375 --> 00:49:28,375
It's okay.

854
00:49:28,458 --> 00:49:30,291
I'm not scared, Tsubaki.

855
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:41,708
This substitute can only
relieve the strain on our Core

856
00:49:41,791 --> 00:49:43,166
for a few weeks.

857
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:06,750
The enemy is assembling
a large strike force,

858
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:08,458
mostly of Eurus type.

859
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:11,166
It would seem they've also
repurposed a number of units

860
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:14,083
that to this point have been
considered "noncombatant".

861
00:50:14,166 --> 00:50:15,208
Hold on, you're saying they've

862
00:50:15,291 --> 00:50:17,250
even rounded up
their own civilians?

863
00:50:17,333 --> 00:50:19,208
So this is what these
Eurus types must have

864
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:21,375
in store for us from now on.

865
00:50:21,458 --> 00:50:23,625
They're not going to hold
anything back, are they?

866
00:50:23,708 --> 00:50:25,583
But with an army of that size.

867
00:50:25,666 --> 00:50:27,000
Can we win?

868
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:29,833
Even if we do,
another wave will come.

869
00:50:29,916 --> 00:50:33,541
Our only hope is to
take out the Festum's Mir.

870
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:36,416
We do have a proposal
we think might help.

871
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,875
Based on our data and
Misao Kurusu's statements,

872
00:50:38,958 --> 00:50:43,625
there is a high probability that
this vessel is the enemy Mir.

873
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:45,250
Still, we just don't
have the resources

874
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,291
to launch a direct assault.

875
00:50:47,375 --> 00:50:49,833
No, that's not what
we're suggesting at all.

876
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:52,750
You ran an operation here three
years ago that was codenamed,

877
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:54,458
"L Project."

878
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:58,541
As former U.N. military,
we can commandeer

879
00:50:58,625 --> 00:51:00,041
the auto-piloted craft.

880
00:51:00,125 --> 00:51:03,208
We'll infiltrate the enemy
lines, and destroy their Mir.

881
00:51:03,291 --> 00:51:04,625
Just like that, huh?

882
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:07,166
We'll try to evacuate
as many personnel as possible

883
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:09,166
before setting off
the ship's Fenrir.

884
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:11,250
Should be enough
to wipe the enemy out.

885
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:14,541
You have to know that's suicide.

886
00:51:14,625 --> 00:51:16,958
You can't evacuate, you'll
be completely surrounded.

887
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:19,000
Why would anyone
volunteer for this?

888
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:22,458
Because the Neo U.N. strike
that created this enemy!

889
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:25,541
And because we still
have a debt to repay.

890
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:27,041
You people saved our lives

891
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:29,500
after our government
basically abandoned us.

892
00:51:29,583 --> 00:51:30,833
This is our duty!

893
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:32,958
I'll grant you permission
to use the submarine.

894
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:34,375
Commander!

895
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:37,083
But I am not going to allow you
to sacrifice yourselves.

896
00:51:37,166 --> 00:51:39,833
The mistakes of the L Project
will not be repeated.

897
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:44,541
This time, it's our turn
to seek dialogue.

898
00:51:53,666 --> 00:51:56,541
The first natural
conception on this island.

899
00:51:56,625 --> 00:51:59,541
The first child born after the
Mir learned of life and death

900
00:51:59,625 --> 00:52:01,416
from Tsubaki Minashiro.

901
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,916
She's an existence akin to Mir;
an unknown quantity,

902
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,958
even to Soshi Minashiro.

903
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:12,125
We have also determined
that Miwa is in a constant

904
00:52:12,208 --> 00:52:13,708
state of crossing.

905
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:17,000
What's more, she's crossing
with the island's Mir itself.

906
00:52:18,958 --> 00:52:20,916
Mama.

907
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,208
I'm not scared.

908
00:52:22,291 --> 00:52:23,291
Can I talk to 'em?

909
00:52:23,375 --> 00:52:25,291
Pretty please?

910
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:26,833
Oh, Miwa.

911
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:49,291
Let's go!

912
00:52:53,791 --> 00:52:55,041
Please, surrender!

913
00:52:55,125 --> 00:52:56,750
Or everyone will be gone!

914
00:52:56,833 --> 00:52:58,708
Go and tell your Mir
to call them back.

915
00:52:58,791 --> 00:53:00,916
But Mir would never
listen to my voice!

916
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,958
So then you tell it,
"The sky is beautiful!"

917
00:53:05,458 --> 00:53:07,041
You weren't ordered
to think that.

918
00:53:07,125 --> 00:53:10,250
You thought it on your own,
like a human, right?

919
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:11,125
Make it listen!

920
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:12,333
Make your god understand

921
00:53:12,416 --> 00:53:14,916
what it means to have
that taken from you!

922
00:53:29,166 --> 00:53:31,583
So even Mama's mama
isn't able to fix it?

923
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:33,583
You can speak our language?

924
00:53:33,666 --> 00:53:35,875
But how?

925
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:39,625
They said if you stay
with me, you can talk, too.

926
00:53:39,708 --> 00:53:43,750
She is our hope,
Commander Makabe.

927
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:46,750
So- Soshi?

928
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:06,708
No!

929
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:16,333
Hey, Rina!

930
00:54:16,416 --> 00:54:17,916
You okay?

931
00:54:24,416 --> 00:54:24,833
Kenji!

932
00:54:24,916 --> 00:54:25,958
No!

933
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:32,041
Okay.

934
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:33,750
I guess it's up to me now.

935
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:43,541
Hang on, Akira!

936
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:17,541
What the hell?

937
00:55:20,125 --> 00:55:21,208
Please.

938
00:55:21,291 --> 00:55:23,291
Only she can make
their Mir understand.

939
00:55:23,375 --> 00:55:26,458
She can tell them
in their own language.

940
00:55:26,541 --> 00:55:27,458
Stop it, Soshi!

941
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:30,291
You're going to disappear!

942
00:55:30,375 --> 00:55:31,208
I'm sorry.

943
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:32,708
Kazuki.

944
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:34,291
I tried.

945
00:55:34,375 --> 00:55:36,166
What is it?

946
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,791
The nothingness we sealed.

947
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:40,291
They're about to reach it.

948
00:55:40,375 --> 00:55:42,125
Will you please just stop it!

949
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:43,333
Why do you suffer?

950
00:55:43,416 --> 00:55:46,375
Is your Mir ordering you
to endure this?

951
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:48,958
We do whatever we have to do
to protect our home!

952
00:55:49,041 --> 00:55:50,500
We make the decision!

953
00:55:50,583 --> 00:55:54,458
Did you only protect Soshi
because your Mir ordered you to?

954
00:55:54,541 --> 00:55:55,708
 No.

955
00:55:55,791 --> 00:55:58,666
I-- I just didn't want
to see him disappear.

956
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:01,625
It's no use.

957
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:03,750
Mir is calling me!

958
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:05,041
Defy your god, Kurusu!

959
00:56:05,125 --> 00:56:06,375
Say no!

960
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,500
Mark Nicht?

961
00:56:29,958 --> 00:56:31,541
So this must be it.

962
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:33,750
The reason for my human form.

963
00:56:34,708 --> 00:56:35,750
Kazuki!

964
00:56:38,666 --> 00:56:41,458
You know, I can still
talk more if you want me to.

965
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:43,875
Yes.

966
00:56:43,958 --> 00:56:45,625
I'm counting on that.

967
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:48,208
Stop!

968
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:49,541
Don't move!

969
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:55,000
You're going to take her
away from me, aren't you?

970
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,208
I won't let you steal my baby!

971
00:57:06,416 --> 00:57:07,625
That's right.

972
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:10,458
You and I have kept it
sealed away together.

973
00:57:10,541 --> 00:57:12,750
All this time, Soshi.

974
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:14,458
And I'll do it.

975
00:57:14,541 --> 00:57:15,750
I will.

976
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:17,583
If that's what you want.

977
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:27,208
Synchronize support fluid
with the Core, stat!

978
00:57:27,291 --> 00:57:28,875
Yes ma'am!

979
00:57:36,666 --> 00:57:37,541
I see.

980
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:38,958
So this is it.

981
00:57:39,041 --> 00:57:40,500
This is hate.

982
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:41,333
Stop.

983
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:42,875
Please don't do this!

984
00:57:48,583 --> 00:57:50,541
You don't have to
obey your Mir!

985
00:57:50,625 --> 00:57:52,583
You know this isn't the answer!

986
00:57:52,666 --> 00:57:54,625
Make your own choice!

987
00:58:05,041 --> 00:58:06,083
Let's plug these leaks!

988
00:58:06,166 --> 00:58:06,958
Hurry!

989
00:58:07,041 --> 00:58:08,375
Now, dammit!

990
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:15,375
You okay, Kenji?

991
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:24,875
You hang onto that, okay?

992
00:58:24,958 --> 00:58:26,250
Now go back up Canon.

993
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:27,291
Got it?

994
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:30,125
And from now on use
our unit names!

995
00:58:30,208 --> 00:58:34,125
But you weren't using them ei--
Wait, what are you gonna do?

996
00:58:34,208 --> 00:58:38,000
I'm gonna teach these bastards
to stay the hell off my island!

997
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:40,875
Go!

998
00:58:40,958 --> 00:58:42,791
Go protect our friends!

999
00:58:42,875 --> 00:58:44,083
Right!

1000
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:48,916
Assimilation.

1001
00:58:53,375 --> 00:58:55,333
Boot authentication for Fenrir.

1002
00:58:55,416 --> 00:58:58,416
To continue, please enter
the authentication key.

1003
00:58:59,375 --> 00:59:00,583
Continue?

1004
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:04,750
No.

1005
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:06,958
They haven't got me yet.

1006
00:59:07,041 --> 00:59:08,708
I'm still here, dammit!

1007
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,083
Fight it, Akira!

1008
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,083
It's too late!

1009
00:59:23,166 --> 00:59:24,166
Go!

1010
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:25,416
Leave me!

1011
00:59:29,625 --> 00:59:35,833
I can-- already feel
myself slipping away.

1012
00:59:35,916 --> 00:59:40,541
Tell Rina I'll be with--
Mom and-- Dad.

1013
00:59:42,541 --> 00:59:43,000
No!

1014
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:44,375
Fight it!

1015
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:07,208
Is that?

1016
01:00:35,583 --> 01:00:37,958
Mark Vier?

1017
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:39,833
Koyo?

1018
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:47,916
Look, Festum!

1019
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,041
The possibility,
who was born among my people.

1020
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:53,291
This girl is the final hope.

1021
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,208
For both our kinds!

1022
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:19,750
Kazuki?

1023
01:01:19,833 --> 01:01:21,416
What're you doing?

1024
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,250
Mark Sein's too dangerous!

1025
01:01:31,958 --> 01:01:32,666
Canon, no!

1026
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:33,916
Hang on!

1027
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:45,750
You're staying right here.

1028
01:01:45,833 --> 01:01:49,250
I'm the only one here who--
who has to do this.

1029
01:02:08,875 --> 01:02:09,791
Stop it!

1030
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:11,041
You're going to
disappear, Kazuki!

1031
01:02:12,166 --> 01:02:13,041
 What?

1032
01:02:30,291 --> 01:02:31,750
What?

1033
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:35,791
Why are you letting me
escape, Kazuki?

1034
01:02:35,875 --> 01:02:38,375
Your kind are the only ones
who wanted this fight!

1035
01:02:38,458 --> 01:02:39,458
It's up to you now!

1036
01:02:39,541 --> 01:02:41,041
Only you can stop it!

1037
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:42,541
Kurusu!

1038
01:02:44,416 --> 01:02:44,833
Kazuki!

1039
01:02:44,916 --> 01:02:46,166
No!

1040
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,833
I didn't want this.

1041
01:03:07,916 --> 01:03:10,666
I don't want your people
to disappear, but--!

1042
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:15,125
What of my kind?

1043
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:17,500
There's still
nothing being born.

1044
01:03:17,583 --> 01:03:20,458
And until then,
I have no choice.

1045
01:03:24,458 --> 01:03:27,375
I have fulfilled
all of my duties.

1046
01:03:27,458 --> 01:03:30,916
Holding me here will generate
no further possibility.

1047
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,708
But you can still
show us how to fight.

1048
01:03:32,791 --> 01:03:34,125
Can't you?

1049
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,458
I have given up
the means to do battle.

1050
01:03:38,541 --> 01:03:44,041
That Mir's condition is not
the possibility truly sought.

1051
01:03:44,125 --> 01:03:46,250
The pain is still multiplying!

1052
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:49,250
I can't bear it alone.

1053
01:03:49,333 --> 01:03:51,208
It's too much!

1054
01:03:51,291 --> 01:03:53,125
I'm sorry Soshi.

1055
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:55,125
I'm just not strong enough.

1056
01:03:55,208 --> 01:03:56,833
But I tried.

1057
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:59,833
"Pain" is Soshi
Minashiro's blessing.

1058
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:02,750
"Life" is Tsubaki
Minashiro's blessing.

1059
01:04:02,833 --> 01:04:05,333
What blessing will you
bestow upon the world?

1060
01:04:05,416 --> 01:04:06,083
What can I do?

1061
01:04:06,166 --> 01:04:07,500
I'm powerless!

1062
01:04:07,583 --> 01:04:10,666
You are the first among
your kind to desire existence

1063
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:12,791
while the Mir was absent.

1064
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:15,833
Ask yourself,
"Why are you there?"

1065
01:04:15,916 --> 01:04:19,791
I only went there
so I could see the sky.

1066
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:22,166
But all I've found is sadness.

1067
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:25,833
I can't bear this
existence anymore!

1068
01:04:25,916 --> 01:04:28,333
I'm going to try
to erase the pain.

1069
01:04:28,416 --> 01:04:34,416
And then Soshi, and Kazuki,
and finally my own existence.

1070
01:04:49,208 --> 01:04:51,291
I saw it, Rina.

1071
01:04:51,375 --> 01:04:54,708
Nothingness inside the Festum.

1072
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:57,500
It was just like when
Mom and Dad disappeared.

1073
01:04:57,583 --> 01:05:00,791
I thought they'd
be somewhere, but--

1074
01:05:00,875 --> 01:05:02,333
There's nowhere to go.

1075
01:05:02,416 --> 01:05:03,916
Well no duh, you moron!

1076
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,541
I've told you a hundred times
they're never coming back,

1077
01:05:06,625 --> 01:05:09,708
but you still leave the front
lights on for them at night,

1078
01:05:09,791 --> 01:05:12,250
and you never want
to float lanterns for them.

1079
01:05:12,333 --> 01:05:13,666
Grandma's getting old,
you know.

1080
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:16,250
If you leave me, pretty soon,
I'll be all alone!

1081
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:19,708
In a house nobody
ever comes home to!

1082
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:21,583
I'm sorry, sis.

1083
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:24,958
Moron.

1084
01:05:28,041 --> 01:05:28,875
I don't understand.

1085
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:30,208
This data stream.

1086
01:05:30,291 --> 01:05:31,666
It's coming from
the unit's core,

1087
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:33,875
even though there
isn't a pilot on board.

1088
01:05:33,958 --> 01:05:35,708
Mark Vier has no core.

1089
01:05:35,791 --> 01:05:39,666
Your old U.N. pals stole it and
used it to create Mark Nicht.

1090
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:42,666
Well something
moved this machine.

1091
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:45,125
It shows the pilot ID
is still Koyo's.

1092
01:05:45,208 --> 01:05:47,750
Koyo Kasugai has come home.

1093
01:05:47,833 --> 01:05:50,916
Somehow he's transformed
himself into the unit's core,

1094
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,833
so he could continue
to protect the island.

1095
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:56,708
We talked about lots n' lots
of different things.

1096
01:05:56,791 --> 01:05:58,125
That's very good, dear.

1097
01:05:58,208 --> 01:05:59,416
Now what sorts of things?

1098
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,791
It was so sad.

1099
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:03,083
They told me
they're all hurting.

1100
01:06:03,166 --> 01:06:04,916
She's your precious little girl.

1101
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,125
You only did what any
other mother would do.

1102
01:06:07,208 --> 01:06:09,583
I'm sure that's not
the way Miwa would see it.

1103
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:11,500
She knows you were
trying to protect her;

1104
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,208
and that's all that matters.

1105
01:06:13,291 --> 01:06:14,958
But what about Kazuki?

1106
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:17,208
Do you think what
Miwa said is true?

1107
01:06:17,291 --> 01:06:19,041
That he didn't
actually disappear?

1108
01:06:19,125 --> 01:06:21,250
That he can still come home.

1109
01:06:21,333 --> 01:06:23,125
 I do believe that, yes.

1110
01:06:23,208 --> 01:06:25,000
This is going to end, right?

1111
01:06:25,083 --> 01:06:27,125
What's the point of living
if everything we love

1112
01:06:27,208 --> 01:06:29,166
is just taken away from us?

1113
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:31,083
We will stop them.

1114
01:06:31,166 --> 01:06:33,666
Even if it costs me my life.

1115
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:39,875
See, they wanted to know more
about the girl holding the baby.

1116
01:06:39,958 --> 01:06:43,125
They wanted to know if she was
hurting as much as they were.

1117
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:45,708
I can talk to them more and
tell them if you want me to!

1118
01:06:45,791 --> 01:06:48,250
Is all this makin'
sense to anyone else?

1119
01:06:48,333 --> 01:06:51,583
She's talking about Tsubaki
Minashiro and the enemy Mir.

1120
01:06:51,666 --> 01:06:54,083
It seems she wishes
to act as a go-between.

1121
01:06:54,166 --> 01:06:55,541
And we're sure.

1122
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:57,583
She's the reason
the Festum pulled back?

1123
01:06:57,666 --> 01:07:00,458
Solomon confirms a massive
data exchange via crossing,

1124
01:07:00,541 --> 01:07:02,833
just minutes before
the end of the last attack.

1125
01:07:02,916 --> 01:07:05,250
A complex code sequence
based on an unknown type

1126
01:07:05,333 --> 01:07:06,833
of transfinite number.

1127
01:07:06,916 --> 01:07:09,083
The human race still hasn't
learned all the numbers

1128
01:07:09,166 --> 01:07:11,000
that exist in this universe.

1129
01:07:11,083 --> 01:07:12,875
This is one we don't know.

1130
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:16,000
And yet, young Miwa Hino
deciphered it intuitively,

1131
01:07:16,083 --> 01:07:18,458
just as naturally as she
learned her first words.

1132
01:07:18,541 --> 01:07:20,958
What's more, she displayed a
level of influence over them

1133
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:23,250
that even Tsubaki
Minashiro couldn't.

1134
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:25,333
If Solomon's developer
were here right now,

1135
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:27,291
she'd probably
be jumping for joy.

1136
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:28,500
So, what?

1137
01:07:28,583 --> 01:07:30,750
She figured out the
enemy's chain of command

1138
01:07:30,833 --> 01:07:32,250
and was somehow
able to overwrite

1139
01:07:32,333 --> 01:07:33,833
the Eurus type's orders?

1140
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:36,041
Putting it in those terms
fails to capture the full

1141
01:07:36,125 --> 01:07:37,666
scope of what's happening.

1142
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:40,375
She insists on calling their
communication "talking",

1143
01:07:40,458 --> 01:07:42,458
but it's more like
she's appealing directly

1144
01:07:42,541 --> 01:07:43,875
to their sensibilities.

1145
01:07:43,958 --> 01:07:45,708
So she's teaching them empathy.

1146
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,375
Is that what you're saying?

1147
01:07:47,458 --> 01:07:50,083
Do you really believe that will
be enough to end the fighting?

1148
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:53,708
That's right, and I'm betting
everything on that fact.

1149
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:57,458
So you wanna use the
auto-piloted sub to slip

1150
01:07:57,541 --> 01:08:00,750
behind enemy lines the
next time they attack.

1151
01:08:00,833 --> 01:08:02,666
And what happens
once you get there?

1152
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:05,500
Miwa Hino will open
a dialog with their Mir.

1153
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:07,333
I'll command the ship myself,

1154
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:09,875
so you'll be in charge
here while I'm gone.

1155
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:12,541
And what did Yumiko
have to say about this plan?

1156
01:08:12,625 --> 01:08:15,083
She agreed, as long as she
was able to join her daughter

1157
01:08:15,166 --> 01:08:16,083
on the boat.

1158
01:08:16,166 --> 01:08:17,916
She knows the risks.

1159
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,291
But we believe
everyone will return.

1160
01:08:20,375 --> 01:08:24,250
If we cannot stop these enemy
attacks, our Core will soon die,

1161
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:26,541
and our island will
be stolen from us.

1162
01:08:26,625 --> 01:08:29,291
This is our last,
best hope for survival.

1163
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:31,958
We must succeed at all costs!

1164
01:08:34,708 --> 01:08:37,166
You're stronger
than I am, Tomotsu.

1165
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:39,750
You never once turned
your back on the Fafners.

1166
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:41,291
No, Ma'am.

1167
01:08:41,375 --> 01:08:44,291
This machine erased
my daughter and son-in-law

1168
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:48,250
from this world and
I've avoided it ever since.

1169
01:08:49,958 --> 01:08:51,791
Logarithm Spiral Model.

1170
01:08:51,875 --> 01:08:54,208
Start-up initiated.

1171
01:08:54,291 --> 01:08:57,375
This is something their mother
and father left behind for them.

1172
01:08:57,458 --> 01:09:00,458
I have to believe it
will protect them for me.

1173
01:09:02,041 --> 01:09:05,166
The following are going
to be your team selections.

1174
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:08,416
Mobile force:
Kenji Kondo, Sakura Kaname,

1175
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:11,041
Rina and Akira Nishio.

1176
01:09:11,125 --> 01:09:16,125
Defense force: Maya Tomi,
Canon Hazama, Hiroto Doma,

1177
01:09:16,208 --> 01:09:18,500
and Koyo Kasugai.

1178
01:09:18,583 --> 01:09:19,833
Mobile Force's objective

1179
01:09:19,916 --> 01:09:22,291
will be to infiltrate
the enemy's home base.

1180
01:09:22,375 --> 01:09:24,500
With luck, we can
take them by surprise.

1181
01:09:24,583 --> 01:09:26,000
We'll only have
one shot at this.

1182
01:09:26,083 --> 01:09:29,083
Let's do our best
to make it count.

1183
01:09:42,416 --> 01:09:45,416
It's time to erase the pain.

1184
01:09:57,750 --> 01:10:00,875
I show Mark Vier is requesting
permission to sortie.

1185
01:10:00,958 --> 01:10:03,208
Open up the gate.

1186
01:10:03,291 --> 01:10:05,208
Mark Vier is going out.

1187
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:09,166
Commence
"Operation Azure, Mark 2"!

1188
01:10:19,208 --> 01:10:21,833
Keep the camouflage
mirror up in roam mode.

1189
01:10:21,916 --> 01:10:24,458
Stand by to
activate control program.

1190
01:10:26,083 --> 01:10:27,833
All units engage!

1191
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:37,833
He's here.

1192
01:11:00,875 --> 01:11:02,750
No sign of the enemy vessel.

1193
01:11:02,833 --> 01:11:04,291
Where are they?

1194
01:11:04,375 --> 01:11:06,458
If we're in the wrong place,
that means the island will be--!

1195
01:11:06,541 --> 01:11:08,375
Prepare to fire torpedoes.

1196
01:11:08,458 --> 01:11:10,208
At what, sir?

1197
01:11:10,291 --> 01:11:13,625
Our intel came to us
from Soshi Minashiro.

1198
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:15,583
That ship is out there.

1199
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:37,208
Craft identified as Neo
U.N. carrier Bollearios!

1200
01:11:37,291 --> 01:11:39,500
A camouflage mirror
and Welle Shields?

1201
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:41,708
It's copied our defense system.

1202
01:11:41,791 --> 01:11:44,708
So in order to defeat us,
they've learned to become us.

1203
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:45,708
Maintain course!

1204
01:11:45,791 --> 01:11:47,500
Ready the Fafners!

1205
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:49,541
Distance to the enemy
shield is two hundred!

1206
01:11:49,625 --> 01:11:50,833
Zero Fafner, go!

1207
01:11:50,916 --> 01:11:52,208
Bring it down!

1208
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,083
It isn't breaking!

1209
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:18,958
Quick, tune in to
the shield's wavelength!

1210
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:19,500
Quiet!

1211
01:12:19,583 --> 01:12:20,958
I know my job!

1212
01:12:34,291 --> 01:12:35,083
Sir!

1213
01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:35,750
The shield has been breached!

1214
01:12:35,833 --> 01:12:37,208
Mark Drei, take off!

1215
01:12:37,291 --> 01:12:40,916
Torpedo batteries, T-1
through T-3, covering fire!

1216
01:13:05,583 --> 01:13:07,166
Mark Acht, you're
clear for take off!

1217
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:08,500
Covering fire!

1218
01:13:47,208 --> 01:13:50,291
Picking up a new energy pattern
in the sky above the carrier.

1219
01:13:50,375 --> 01:13:51,708
It's the enemy Mir.

1220
01:13:53,041 --> 01:13:55,041
Get the Hino family
on the phone, please.

1221
01:13:55,125 --> 01:13:56,166
What?

1222
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,916
Our island?

1223
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:31,333
So much hatred.

1224
01:14:33,166 --> 01:14:35,166
Stop it, Mir!

1225
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:37,583
Don't make me carry
a burden like that!

1226
01:14:47,125 --> 01:14:48,625
Eat this!

1227
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:34,791
Enemy field,
descending from above!

1228
01:15:34,875 --> 01:15:36,708
Do not let it reach us!

1229
01:15:36,791 --> 01:15:37,208
Go!

1230
01:15:37,291 --> 01:15:38,083
Dodge it!

1231
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:39,208
Release all remaining shields!

1232
01:15:39,291 --> 01:15:41,291
Take the island
full speed ahead!

1233
01:15:51,291 --> 01:15:53,000
Don't cry, Tsubaki.

1234
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:54,750
I'm not scared.

1235
01:15:57,916 --> 01:15:59,000
The Assimilation.

1236
01:15:59,083 --> 01:16:00,583
It's beginning.

1237
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:03,250
I couldn't stop it.

1238
01:16:03,333 --> 01:16:05,375
Why can't I save anyone?

1239
01:16:17,041 --> 01:16:19,416
I've got to protect my friends!

1240
01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:36,500
Where's Kazuki?

1241
01:16:36,583 --> 01:16:37,833
Give him back!

1242
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:56,166
You want to go outside?

1243
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:57,291
Can we?

1244
01:16:57,375 --> 01:16:58,791
I can't talk from in here.

1245
01:16:58,875 --> 01:16:59,500
Miwa!

1246
01:16:59,583 --> 01:17:00,208
No.

1247
01:17:00,291 --> 01:17:01,583
It's far too dangerous!

1248
01:17:01,666 --> 01:17:02,916
Perhaps.

1249
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,583
But it might just be our
only way to break through.

1250
01:17:06,666 --> 01:17:08,333
Alert our Fafner pilots.

1251
01:17:08,416 --> 01:17:09,500
We're coming up.

1252
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:12,041
We'll surface
behind the enemy ship.

1253
01:17:12,125 --> 01:17:14,250
It's time to clear the path.

1254
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:27,458
Is that Kazuki's mother?

1255
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:37,041
Please Synchronize me
with your Mir.

1256
01:17:39,083 --> 01:17:42,666
You may Use me to
keep the core alive.

1257
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:43,500
 Akane!

1258
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:45,458
Why are you doing this?

1259
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:48,791
It is because this
is my final possibility.

1260
01:17:52,958 --> 01:17:54,083
No.

1261
01:17:54,166 --> 01:17:57,083
Because of something
the former core told me.

1262
01:18:01,708 --> 01:18:06,625
That this island was the place
I should come home to.

1263
01:18:24,208 --> 01:18:26,250
There are no enemies
detected overhead.

1264
01:18:26,333 --> 01:18:27,583
Then take us up!

1265
01:18:29,083 --> 01:18:30,375
Are you alright?

1266
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:34,916
Don't worry.

1267
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,208
For now, I'm still right here.

1268
01:19:26,791 --> 01:19:27,916
Huh?

1269
01:20:11,041 --> 01:20:13,416
Hey, you're doing great.

1270
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,958
Are you ready for more?

1271
01:20:15,041 --> 01:20:16,375
Yeah!

1272
01:20:34,041 --> 01:20:35,541
Why won't you just stop this?

1273
01:20:35,625 --> 01:20:37,125
What're you gonna do now?

1274
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:39,916
Erase everything in
the world you don't like?

1275
01:20:48,541 --> 01:20:51,208
Don't you see; Mir was
supposed to be reborn!

1276
01:20:51,291 --> 01:20:54,333
The fire you humans brought
down on us changed everything!

1277
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:56,541
So then you try
to change it again!

1278
01:20:56,625 --> 01:20:58,666
Soshi gambled
everything on you!

1279
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:00,833
He sent you to meet us!

1280
01:21:00,916 --> 01:21:03,125
He believed that
you were different!

1281
01:21:16,916 --> 01:21:19,208
My choice has
already been forced!

1282
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:21,125
I've made your kind suffer.

1283
01:21:21,208 --> 01:21:23,375
How can I change after that?

1284
01:21:24,916 --> 01:21:25,791
Listen.

1285
01:21:25,875 --> 01:21:27,291
I've hurt people, too.

1286
01:21:27,375 --> 01:21:29,500
People like Soshi

1287
01:21:29,583 --> 01:21:31,875
I have caused him so much pain.

1288
01:21:31,958 --> 01:21:34,875
But still, he always
believed in me.

1289
01:21:39,625 --> 01:21:41,166
Don't you see?

1290
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:42,500
You are me.

1291
01:21:42,583 --> 01:21:43,875
And I?

1292
01:21:43,958 --> 01:21:45,500
I am you.

1293
01:21:53,666 --> 01:21:55,000
Wait!

1294
01:21:55,083 --> 01:21:57,375
There's always another choice.

1295
01:21:57,458 --> 01:21:59,583
And even if it's
painful sometimes.

1296
01:21:59,666 --> 01:22:02,875
You just have to
keep choosing to be there!

1297
01:22:02,958 --> 01:22:03,666
Kazuki!

1298
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:04,208
No!

1299
01:22:04,291 --> 01:22:05,541
Don't disappear!

1300
01:22:10,791 --> 01:22:12,041
Mir.

1301
01:22:12,125 --> 01:22:15,125
Please, I-- I don't
want to fight anymore!

1302
01:22:34,916 --> 01:22:36,583
The sky.

1303
01:22:40,833 --> 01:22:41,958
See?

1304
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:44,208
The sky is beautiful.

1305
01:22:47,166 --> 01:22:48,833
Yes, we're both here.

1306
01:22:48,916 --> 01:22:51,083
And I'm happy, too.

1307
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:01,041
Neo U.N. bombers.

1308
01:23:01,125 --> 01:23:03,416
Enola 512's, inbound!

1309
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,833
Sending hails, but no answer!

1310
01:23:05,916 --> 01:23:10,166
So they wanna wipe out the
enemy and us along with 'em.

1311
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:11,583
You assholes.

1312
01:23:11,666 --> 01:23:13,416
We're humans, too!

1313
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,666
And we're right here!

1314
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:24,958
Mama!

1315
01:23:25,041 --> 01:23:26,666
I'm scared!

1316
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:28,291
Miwa, no!

1317
01:23:38,416 --> 01:23:39,583
No, don't erase her!

1318
01:23:39,666 --> 01:23:40,916
Stop, Mir!

1319
01:24:12,041 --> 01:24:15,166
I think the sky
is beautiful, too.

1320
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:24,625
Let us be born together.

1321
01:24:29,541 --> 01:24:33,583
It's time for us
to say goodbye, Seri.

1322
01:24:51,291 --> 01:24:52,375
Mama, that was scary!

1323
01:24:52,458 --> 01:24:53,708
My baby!

1324
01:24:53,791 --> 01:24:56,791
They sacrificed
themselves to shield us.

1325
01:25:16,083 --> 01:25:18,625
"Help me. Stop the pain."

1326
01:25:26,708 --> 01:25:27,875
It's finished.

1327
01:25:27,958 --> 01:25:30,416
The core has
completed its growth phase.

1328
01:25:34,583 --> 01:25:36,166
Oh, Akane.

1329
01:25:37,791 --> 01:25:41,500
Shield output and biosphere
functions are all still normal.

1330
01:25:41,583 --> 01:25:45,166
And radioactivity
readings are-- are zero!

1331
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:46,416
It's a miracle!

1332
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,375
No, it's not a miracle.

1333
01:25:48,458 --> 01:25:51,000
The island just protected
us to the very last.

1334
01:25:53,041 --> 01:25:54,250
The pain.

1335
01:25:54,333 --> 01:25:55,833
It's fading.

1336
01:25:55,916 --> 01:25:57,125
It's the Mir.

1337
01:25:57,208 --> 01:25:58,333
It's become air.

1338
01:25:58,416 --> 01:25:59,041
Look!

1339
01:25:59,125 --> 01:26:00,666
They're going away!

1340
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:04,208
All the fighting.

1341
01:26:04,291 --> 01:26:06,125
Does this mean
it's finally over?

1342
01:26:06,208 --> 01:26:09,500
That is a choice we'll
hope they continue to make.

1343
01:26:09,583 --> 01:26:10,833
All that's certain is that

1344
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:14,375
our planet has just become
their homeland as well.

1345
01:26:21,083 --> 01:26:22,958
We finally have a blue sky.

1346
01:26:23,041 --> 01:26:24,625
Seri.

1347
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:49,375
Kazuki.

1348
01:26:49,458 --> 01:26:50,625
I can't see you.

1349
01:26:50,708 --> 01:26:52,541
Is that you, Kurusu?

1350
01:26:52,625 --> 01:26:53,750
I wanted to at least erase

1351
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:56,750
the thing that kept you
from seeing the sky.

1352
01:26:56,833 --> 01:26:58,833
I'm sorry to do it
without asking.

1353
01:26:58,916 --> 01:27:02,000
But it makes me happy to know
you'll get to see it again.

1354
01:27:04,833 --> 01:27:06,875
And he's gone.

1355
01:27:06,958 --> 01:27:11,125
One day, you might come to the
place where he'll be born anew.

1356
01:27:11,208 --> 01:27:15,416
And if you can't look at
the sky together, he'll be sad.

1357
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:18,708
That was his final thought.

1358
01:27:18,791 --> 01:27:21,916
 Is it really you?

1359
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,666
He was protecting
my existence that whole time.

1360
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:28,333
He fought against Mir
even as he obeyed.

1361
01:27:28,416 --> 01:27:32,541
Instead of assimilation, he led
us to a peaceful coexistence.

1362
01:27:32,625 --> 01:27:34,000
I can see you.

1363
01:27:34,083 --> 01:27:37,083
I can really see you, Soshi.

1364
01:27:37,166 --> 01:27:38,500
Thank you, Kazuki.

1365
01:27:38,583 --> 01:27:43,583
Thank you, for protecting
my place to come home to.

1366
01:27:52,541 --> 01:27:54,166
Welcome home.

1367
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:05,958
Welcome home, Soshi!

1368
01:28:09,041 --> 01:28:12,416
The boundless pain
that fills our world.

1369
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:15,333
Does it all have
some place to go home to?

1370
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:17,875
For now.

1371
01:28:17,958 --> 01:28:21,000
I choose to believe that
supreme serenity awaits us

1372
01:28:21,083 --> 01:28:27,041
when we finally make it home and
that that is why we're here.
