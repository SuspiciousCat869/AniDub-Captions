1
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:33,466
[clap of thunder]

2
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,537
[instrumental music playing]

3
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,682
[female narrator] Light is born from darkness.

4
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:33,319
Darkness finds it way north to become water,

5
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,990
while light sails south to give birth to fire.

6
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:41,227
Wind ebbs and flows between the light and the dark.

7
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:45,765
Light slips inside the darkness where it returns to earth.

8
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:51,404
Now is the time for you to show us your true nature.

9
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:56,876
Which path, light or darkness, will you choose?

10
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,746
[instrumental music continues]

11
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,434
[male narrator] All are rooted in their one true-shared trait.

12
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,904
And it is from that trait that they are each created.

13
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:09,075
That trait determines and influences how the Digimon

14
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,711
will transition into their next form.

15
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:17,383
The question is... what happens to those who were not chosen?

16
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:45,712
My Mei...

17
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:50,183
[grunts]

18
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,452
[surge of electricity]

19
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,619
[wind howling]

20
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:54,921
[sinister laughter]

21
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,824
[roars]

22
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,761
Huh.

23
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,568
Are you somewhere crying, my little Mei?

24
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,636
[voice trembling] I wish I could help you.

25
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,143
[train bells ringing]

26
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,189
Hey. You guys aren't supposed to be here.

27
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,959
Yeah. He's right. You guys are human, aren't you?

28
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,761
I can tell by your furry heads.

29
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,996
Whatever they are, I don't like the looks of them.

30
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,531
I don't know.

31
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,833
They don't really look all that dangerous to me.

32
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:44,837
Hey, you know, maybe that's how they act before they eat you.

33
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,206
Come to think of it, we don't know what humans eat.

34
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,742
Plus, they're so skinny, they must be starving.

35
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,210
Just settle down, please.

36
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,646
We can't understand you when you're all talking at once.

37
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:54,881
[Koromon] We are settled down!

38
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,616
[chuckles] You have not changed, little dude.

39
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:58,618
Huh? [grunts]

40
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,920
-[squeals] -Come, little Tanemon.

41
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,221
[laughing]

42
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,557
I don't want to be eaten! [screams]

43
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,225
Now, you stop that.

44
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,628
Partners don't eat each other, ever, 'kay?

45
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,563
What's that word mean?

46
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,932
-[Mimi] What word? -Partner.

47
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,234
[gasps] I get it.

48
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:19,071
You really don't remember me, do you?

49
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,240
[Tsunomon] Why are you staring at me like that?

50
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,243
Are you thinking that I look delicious? Is that it?

51
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,045
Not at all.

52
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,780
[Tsunomon] You're still staring.

53
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,715
[chuckles then gasps]

54
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,718
[Kari] Well, look who it is.

55
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:33,953
[Tsunomon] Yipes! She's spotted you

56
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:38,057
and now she's coming for you! Run for your life! [screams]

57
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,160
You didn't run off. That's brave. Thank you.

58
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:44,096
I'm Kari. You want to be friends?

59
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,200
I promise you can trust me, and I won't hurt you.

60
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,669
Hmm. [sniffing]

61
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:57,009
You smell kinda like my whistle! Mm. It's familiar somehow.

62
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,077
[chuckles]

63
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,249
Yokomon! Yokomon, where are you?

64
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,253
-[Yokomon] Ow! You big klutz! -Huh? [gasps]

65
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,289
Why don't you watch where you're going?

66
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:14,093
Sorry! Sorry! Oh, are you okay?

67
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,329
What do you think you're doing? Put me down!

68
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,297
Help! I'm getting diginapped!

69
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,333
[gasps] Diginapped?

70
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:25,838
[grunts] I'd never do anything to hurt you, not ever.

71
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,573
-Really? -Yes.

72
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:28,174
[Yokomon grumbles]

73
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,944
I just can't believe you don't remember me.

74
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,713
You and I are partners.

75
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,182
[Yokomon] Stop following me around!

76
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,885
Wait! What about all the time we spent together?

77
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,353
I know everything about you.

78
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,256
You and I have always been a great team.

79
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,224
I know you hate asparagus.

80
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,627
-[Yokomon] What's asparagus? -[Sora gasps]

81
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,862
[Yokomon] There's no way we were ever friends.

82
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,130
Yokomon...

83
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,768
[Izzy] I keep replying to Miss Himekawa but it won't send.

84
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,771
No internet and I think the gates vanished too.

85
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:02,041
Seems like the whole digital world's either offline

86
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,876
or got corrupted after the reboot.

87
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,746
-What's a reboot? -Can you eat it?

88
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,982
Hey, you know a lot of stuff and a lot of the grids.

89
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:13,052
Where do you keep 'em all? You have an extra brain?

90
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:17,957
I wish I had an extra brain. A reboot's for a computer.

91
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,792
Kind of a fresh start,

92
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,360
when things aren't working right.

93
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,396
-Can a computer make food? -[grunts]

94
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:24,931
Hey, who are you?

95
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,401
[TK] Your eyes are completely clear.

96
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:31,170
Not a trace of infection.

97
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:34,907
-I don't feel sick. -Nope, and you're not.

98
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,409
Here's the deal, Tokomon.

99
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,811
What do you say we become best friends for life?

100
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,880
-For reals? -Yep.

101
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,982
Absolutely for reals.

102
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,216
Hmm.

103
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,387
-Okey-dokey. -[chuckles]

104
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,357
So, what?

105
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,960
So, what are we doing?

106
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:54,827
Hmm.

107
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,663
Obviously, we have to find a way home

108
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:01,934
or else wait for Himekawa to rescue us, but either way,

109
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:05,037
the first thing we have to do is find food and shelter here.

110
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,139
And unfortunately, these guys haven't digivolved

111
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,074
enough yet to help us.

112
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,676
[Mimi] We're doomed, finished, has-beens!

113
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,445
[Sora] Huh? Why would you say that, Mimi?

114
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:15,848
[sobbing] Just messing with you!

115
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:18,751
I know we'll get back home just like we did last time!

116
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,921
Yep! Just think positive! Right?

117
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,457
Be chill just like you, right, Tannie?

118
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,692
-Yeah! [screams] -Okay.

119
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,729
So you forgot how to chill. That's fine.

120
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,364
We'll just go back to the start,

121
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,300
and I'll teach you again like I taught you before.

122
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,134
Lucky.

123
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,004
But right now, none of that matters.

124
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,072
What's important is that we're all together again.

125
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,474
[screams] Don't eat me!

126
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,476
That's enough of that nonsense.

127
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:46,479
I already told you I'm not going to eat you.

128
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,981
None of us is going to eat any of you.

129
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,851
Look, we knew this would probably happen,

130
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,920
that you Digimon might forget about us after the reboot.

131
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:58,491
But I believe all of you are going to remember us eventually.

132
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,793
We'll just have to work at it, that's all.

133
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,763
Like partners. Because that's what we are.

134
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,931
And if you've really lost all those memories,

135
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,300
we'll just have to make new ones.

136
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,435
Together.

137
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,070
[sighs]

138
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,106
[Mimi chuckling] You are such a cutie.

139
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:18,177
[TK] Poor Tanemon. [chuckles]

140
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,745
[Matt] Mimi does not give up.

141
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,982
[Mimi] I'm coming in for a snuggle!

142
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,118
-[rustling sounds] -[both] Huh?

143
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,319
[all gasp]

144
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,157
[Tai] All right, whoever you are.

145
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,358
Show yourself!

146
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,094
[sobbing]

147
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,329
Meicoomon?

148
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:38,964
Huh?

149
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,300
[Mimi] You guys know this Digimon?

150
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,772
No way! And she's still at her champion level!

151
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,775
Mei? Where's Mei?

152
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,277
[all gasp]

153
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,179
Whoa.

154
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,182
So, you remember her? Your Meiko?

155
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,818
Mei! [sobs]

156
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:02,188
[sobbing continues]

157
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,422
[all gasp]

158
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,958
[Matt] Tai, wait up!

159
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,031
[Meicoomon grunting]

160
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:16,035
[Tai] Meicoomon! Stop! We only want to help!

161
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,770
[grunts] No.

162
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,207
[surge of electricity]

163
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,809
The access point to the distortion port.

164
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,177
But why here?

165
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,781
[approaching footsteps]

166
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:32,384
[panting and grunting]

167
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,790
[sighs] Still no messages. Not good.

168
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:39,859
[grunts]

169
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,261
[Koromon] Look at all the goodies!

170
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,597
I've never seen so much food!

171
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,233
[all] Ah, wow!

172
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,902
Can we start? My mouth is watering?

173
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,239
-My whole body is watering. -It looks so good!

174
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,242
[chuckles] Well, I guess they like the food.

175
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,077
Sora, did you bring all this stuff with you?

176
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,211
Sure.

177
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,947
We were going to have to eat, so I just planned ahead.

178
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,283
Planned ahead? You're a star!

179
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,619
Without you, we would have been forced to eat bugs.

180
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:09,455
Well, that's a little dramatic. Now, pass out those plates.

181
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:10,923
[all giggling]

182
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,458
[Sora] Come on, everybody! Eat up!

183
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,393
[Izzy] Where were you keeping all this stuff?

184
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:18,264
[gulping] Ah, I thought I'd tried everything,

185
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,232
but this is the best drink ever.

186
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,467
Uh, glad you like it.

187
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,869
Uh, what was that name you called it?

188
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:26,639
It's tea. Tea is made from leaves,

189
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,375
and there are lots of different kinds you can choose from.

190
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:32,144
My absolute favorite is umon tea,

191
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,347
but there's peppermint tea, white tea,

192
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,651
spearmint tea, mulberry tea, herbal tea,

193
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:41,654
yellow tea, mint tea, ginger tea,

194
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:45,291
lemon tea, lemon grass tea, peppermint tea...

195
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:49,929
Oh yeah, and you can even get pumpkin tea. [laughs]

196
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,664
[Motimon] I think you made your point.

197
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:54,300
Oh, I'm just getting started. Then you have all your--

198
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,335
Sounds like there's a lot of tea in your world.

199
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,037
Maybe too much.

200
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,139
Plus, tea is not only delicious...

201
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,674
-We got it! -...but good for your health.

202
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:02,908
What else you got that I can eat?

203
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:06,579
Well, I do have this sandwich, but I was kind of saving it.

204
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,614
-Oh well. -Aww!

205
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,984
I hate to eat your lunch, but if you insist. [munches]

206
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,419
Hey, and you know, even scientists say--

207
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,921
Now I'm lost. What are scientists?

208
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:18,591
Do they have big brains and talk as much as you do?

209
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,259
Sorry. Got carried away.

210
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,462
Anyway, I wanted to ask you some questions about this world.

211
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,365
[Mimi] All right. Intermission time, Professor.

212
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:29,134
Sora made all this food. Now it's time to eat it.

213
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,437
Open up. Ah.

214
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,671
[winces]

215
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:36,542
Whoa! Would you actually refuse my special treat?

216
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:41,080
Uh, just when I can't identify it and... what are those things?

217
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,615
They look like jelly beans.

218
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,316
[Mimi] Jelly beans and whipped cream

219
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,619
on top of Sora's cucumber bacon roll.

220
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,454
I just invented it.

221
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:51,390
I know you love jelly beans, and I made enough for everyone.

222
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:54,059
[Izzy] Wow, Mimi. What an unusual topping.

223
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,629
[Mimi] All right, gang. Open up. Ah.

224
00:14:56,662 --> 00:15:00,432
See? Sora isn't the only one who can make delicious treats.

225
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,634
Who wants seconds?

226
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,036
[nervous laughter]

227
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,704
They don't remember anything.

228
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,407
I guess the reboot deleted us entirely.

229
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,043
There has to be some way to restore their memories.

230
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:14,046
Well, we were warned this would probably happen.

231
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,448
But why didn't it happen to all of them?

232
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,583
Meicooman remembers.

233
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,653
Really? She ran from us.

234
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:23,022
Shouldn't we try to find her?

235
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,058
[Tai] Meicoomon.

236
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,561
I remember her too...

237
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,564
and everything she did.

238
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:39,038
What if we get her back and then find out she can't be saved?

239
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,573
Meicoomon and Meiko are part of us now.

240
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,311
We're not turning our backs on them!

241
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:48,747
I know that, but I'm still worried.

242
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,982
[Joe] Hmm.

243
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:59,325
Tai! Tai! It's the most amazing thing ever! [munches]

244
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,494
These slippery tube things make my mouth so happy!

245
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:06,098
-Say it, don't spray it! -But it's the best food ever!

246
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,334
I just... had to tell you.

247
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,036
I think I'm in love with this stuff!

248
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,571
You're in love all right,

249
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:15,107
with whatever food you happen to be eating at the time.

250
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,643
Mm. Yeah, you might be right about that.

251
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,579
You love hotdogs, curly fries and cheeseburgers,

252
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:21,747
pancakes and bacon.

253
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,650
For that matter, I can't think of a food you don't like.

254
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,618
-For reals? -Mm-hm.

255
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,121
I've never heard of any of those, but I'll try 'em!

256
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,589
[laughing] All right.

257
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:34,727
Now, I guess I know you better than you know yourself.

258
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,062
And here's something else you like. [chuckles]

259
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:41,333
Whoa! [laughing]

260
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,736
Hey, that looks super fun!

261
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,804
I want to do that too! Me next! Me next!

262
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,373
I want to go, too.

263
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,441
[Nyaromon] Kari, can you pick me up?

264
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,311
-Huh? -Come on. I want to fly.

265
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,614
-Of course. Come here. -Oh, yay.

266
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,249
[Kari chuckles]

267
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,288
[munching and grumbling]

268
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,391
So, do you like the meatballs?

269
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,459
Nah.

270
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:11,096
Oh, well how about these other things, then? Here.

271
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,698
I don't want anything else.

272
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:16,168
Oh, uh, my... my bad.

273
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,669
I'm sorry.

274
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,675
[phone ringing]

275
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,152
[Himekawa's answering machine] You've reached Agent Himekawa.

276
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,887
I'm sorry I'm not able to take your call.

277
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,822
Please leave a detailed message after the tone

278
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:40,159
-and I'll get back to you. -[machine beeps]

279
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:43,362
[Nishijima] It's Nishijima. I can't find Meiko.

280
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,764
She hasn't been home in several days.

281
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:49,401
If she contacts you, give me a call right away.

282
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,103
[train bells ringing]

283
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,241
[electrical crackling]

284
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,712
[Digimon snoring]

285
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,890
Anybody heard from Miss Himekawa?

286
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,192
[TK] Nope. Nothing.

287
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:17,863
And we won't. Without a signal, I can't contact Jenna either.

288
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:21,800
There's something really strange about this whole place.

289
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:25,571
Ugh! You guys are such downers. We'll figure it out.

290
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,139
Well, what's our next move then?

291
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,177
[Tai] We need to find Meicooman.

292
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,712
Yeah, we do.

293
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:36,882
Like you said before, they're part of our team.

294
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,784
We can't give up hope.

295
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,753
-Meicoomon and Meiko need us. -[chuckles]

296
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,555
[Tai] We have to reunite them.

297
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,661
Hmm. We don't know if Meicooman's still infected

298
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,630
or what the distortions did to her.

299
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:54,199
The reboot should have cured the infection,

300
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,601
but there's still a chance it didn't.

301
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,604
We may have to reboot again. [sighs]

302
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,305
Are you seriously saying

303
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,474
that we just went through all this for nothing?

304
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,409
That the stupid reboot didn't even work?

305
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:05,944
[Izzy] I hope not.

306
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,947
[Sora] We need a little more than hope right now!

307
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,384
Well, come on! Let's spread out and find Meicooman.

308
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,753
Then we can worry about all the rest of that stuff.

309
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:17,789
Yeah. Let's focus on one thing at a time.

310
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:21,226
I don't know how, but we'll find a way out of this jam.

311
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,229
And we're gonna do it together.

312
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,632
[Mimi] Woo-hoo! That's what I'm talking about!

313
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,535
Let's get this show on the road, digi-dustballs!

314
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:32,271
Uh, let's formulate a plan first, at least.

315
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:35,641
No sense going off in different directions all discombobulated.

316
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,843
A well-planned search is a successful search.

317
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,646
Now that sounds just like the Joe I grew up with.

318
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,582
I like to think I've matured a little bit since then.

319
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,884
-And even got a girlfriend. -[others giggle]

320
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:49,254
-She's not made up! -[all laughing]

321
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,657
Okay. Time to head out, gang.

322
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,326
Hey, on your feet little g--

323
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,328
-Huh? -[all gasp]

324
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,630
What's wrong? [screams] No way!

325
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,634
Hi. Hello.

326
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:03,569
[all gasp]

327
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:06,271
[Joe] Did they eat their way to a digiball?

328
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,639
[Tai] What, like too many jelly beans?

329
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,575
That or we're hallucinating.

330
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,377
[laughs] Look at me. I can fly!

331
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:13,679
[Tentomon] Yeah, me too!

332
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,681
-Go Tentomon! -Patamon!

333
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,782
[laughs]

334
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:19,952
This is way more fun than being stuck on the ground!

335
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:20,719
[both laugh]

336
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:25,691
[giggles] Wow! I'm pretty, aren't I?

337
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:29,628
Oh, you sure are. You are super pretty, Palmon.

338
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,496
Ha. Just like you.

339
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,564
-Look, I'm back! -[Kari laughing]

340
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,502
[Gabumon] Hmm? Well, say something, Mr. Matt.

341
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,605
Why are you staring at me like that?

342
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,907
I don't have whipped cream all over my face, do I?

343
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,710
Check him out. Bukamon leveled up, Tai.

344
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,745
How did we do that, Agumon?

345
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,780
We ate a ton of food until we were stuffed,

346
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,515
and then we took a nice long nap.

347
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,517
[laughs] That sounds about right.

348
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,587
Come to think of it, I'm getting a little hungry again.

349
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,522
Let's eat more and get even bigger.

350
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,758
-Yeah! -[TK laughs]

351
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,394
Well, even though the reboot deleted their memories,

352
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,663
looks like things are getting back to normal.

353
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:05,831
[Sora] There you are.

354
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,332
-I was looking for you. -Hmm?

355
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,534
How does it feel to be leveled up?

356
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:13,605
Why do you keep bothering me? I told you, I don't know you!

357
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:18,076
Go play with your human friends and forget you ever knew me!

358
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,445
But I can't. [sobs]

359
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,415
[train bells ringing distantly]

360
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,821
[Meicoomon sobbing]

361
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:32,991
Mei, why did you abandon me here?

362
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:49,741
I'm all alone and it's so scary in this place.

363
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,848
I don't know what to do.

364
00:21:56,882 --> 00:22:02,087
I don't-- I don't know-- what's happening to me?

365
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,624
[growl]

366
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,427
[electrical crackling]

367
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,508
[Kari] Tai's been gone for a while.

368
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:24,810
Should we go look for him?

369
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,611
-[Izzy] No. Let's stay put. -[Digimon snoring]

370
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:29,014
I'm sure he's moving around trying to get a signal.

371
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:33,919
If we split up now, odds are, somebody'll get lost out there.

372
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,420
[Kari] Hmm?

373
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,455
Come here.

374
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:37,923
Hmm?

375
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,525
There he is. Hey, Tai.

376
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,426
[Joe] Took you long enough.

377
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,895
We're glad you're back. Have any luck?

378
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,031
[Tai] No bars, no signal. No nothing.

379
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:48,533
So, for now that means we're on our own.

380
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,136
Let's just concentrate on trying to find Meicooman.

381
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,572
Before, whenever there was a distortion,

382
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:56,108
it turned out Meicooman was at the center of it.

383
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,610
So if I can figure out a way to track the distortions

384
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:00,846
in this world, we may be able to zero in on her.

385
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,749
I wish there was something I could do to help you out.

386
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,016
[Izzy] I can do this.

387
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,854
[Tai] Of course. Just what are you looking for?

388
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,055
Hmm...

389
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:13,859
-[Izzy] An anomaly in the code. -That anomaly better run.

390
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,927
[Mimi] Mei-Mei, still in the DigiWorld.

391
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,764
Will bring Meicooman back. Send!

392
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,633
Sending, sending, sending...

393
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,869
-[failure to send alert] -[Mimi] Ugh, so infuriating!

394
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,505
Come on! Why won't it send?

395
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,206
[sighs] I guess I should have tried a little harder

396
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,674
to get Meiko to come with us.

397
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,811
Maybe. But the way things are going so far,

398
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,679
I think it's probably a good thing she didn't.

399
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,148
This could have really freaked her out.

400
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:37,282
Yeah, maybe.

401
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,985
[Mimi] What are you talking about? That's not fair!

402
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:41,853
Meiko's just as brave and tough as any one of us

403
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:42,954
and you know it!

404
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,857
[TK stammering] No. It's not that-- I didn't say--

405
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:46,858
What I meant was just--

406
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:49,795
You know, we've all been in the DigiWorld before.

407
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:53,832
You know Meiko. She's so sweet and sensitive.

408
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,567
Ooh.

409
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,769
-What does that mean? -It's obvious.

410
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:01,706
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid my heart belongs to...

411
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,575
-Matt. -Ah, give me a break.

412
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,144
Then it's true. No girls allowed.

413
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:09,047
Stop that! It's not my fault he doesn't have a girlfriend!

414
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,615
[girls giggling]

415
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,185
I'm gonna... get some more wood.

416
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,821
[Mimi] Great idea. I love a big fire!

417
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:21,226
[all snoring]

418
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:29,768
[Digimon snoring and muttering]

419
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,182
-[rustling noise] -Hmm?

420
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,687
[Tai] Are you going to tell us what's wrong?

421
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,222
[Sora] What difference would it make?

422
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:54,059
-[Tai] Well, maybe we can help. -[Matt] Yeah, exactly.

423
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:55,894
[Tai] I mean, if there's something wrong,

424
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:57,195
we should talk it out.

425
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:01,633
-Tai? -Uh, sure.

426
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:08,540
Uh, that food! That food you made was great.

427
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,611
[Matt groans]

428
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:13,211
Oh.

429
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,716
I guess this is a Sora subject then? [chuckles]

430
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:19,217
-[groans] -Go away.

431
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,695
[Tai] Okay. Let's try this again.

432
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,697
[Matt] And no bad jokes this time.

433
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,371
[Tai] We are not leaving here until you tell us

434
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:40,939
how we can help you.

435
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:42,274
[Tai and Matt] Huh?

436
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:45,677
-[Sora] Thanks, guys. -[Tai] Hey, Agumon!

437
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,679
[panting]

438
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,117
This is no time for rafting, pal!

439
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,852
What? Wait.

440
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,821
How'd I get here? I was having this great dream.

441
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,223
-I was eating fish. -Huh?

442
00:25:58,256 --> 00:25:59,090
And chips.

443
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:01,893
You are just a nonstop eating machine.

444
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,295
Yeah.

445
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:06,965
[Tai and Agumon laughing]

446
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,100
[Sora] Well, at least somebody's happy.

447
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,141
Come on. Sora?

448
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:18,910
[Tai] I'll be right behind you.

449
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:22,914
Listen, don't move. I gotta go do damage control.

450
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:25,884
-[yawns] -[Tai] Sora! Stop already!

451
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,787
I'm sorry, but I couldn't let the little guy drown!

452
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:34,659
[grunting and panting]

453
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:41,099
There has to be something I'm overlooking, some clue.

454
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,204
[Nishijima] What else do you know?

455
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:48,006
[man] That's all the information I've got.

456
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:52,811
She's missing? She wouldn't just leave and not tell me.

457
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:55,013
[keys clicking]

458
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,285
[Nishijima] I'm going to find you, Hime.

459
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:07,425
I need to know what you were up to before this happened.

460
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:10,061
That's it!

461
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,832
Please let the old password work.

462
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,934
Fingers crossed.

463
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,135
Yes!

464
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:35,186
Now what? Should we compliment her on her meatballs?

465
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,088
It has nothing to do with her meatballs!

466
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,757
How can you be so stupid!

467
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,459
Well, Mr. Emotional, why don't you go talk to her

468
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,161
and make her feel better?

469
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:45,497
This is a job for TK.

470
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,465
[Sora] I can hear you, you boneheads.

471
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:50,368
[both sigh]

472
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,772
Can you at least tell us why you're upset?

473
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,240
I shouldn't have to.

474
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,776
If you cared about me at all, you'd know already.

475
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:01,946
-Maybe you could give us a hint. -I can't put it into words.

476
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,982
[both] We need TK.

477
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:07,318
I knew neither of you would understand! [sobs]

478
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,821
-[both gasp] -Sora, wait up!

479
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,956
[Sora] You're supposed to be our leader, Tai,

480
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,491
but you don't know a thing about us!

481
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,226
And you're just as bad, Matt.

482
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,328
Always moping around, angry at the world!

483
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,431
The only thing you guys are good at is fighting,

484
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,499
especially with each other!

485
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,401
But I guess that's just how it is.

486
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:26,838
Let Sora take care of everybody. She'll be fine.

487
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:30,775
Don't worry about her. Well, I have feelings, too.

488
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,377
Your feelings have been a mystery to me

489
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,379
since we were kids.

490
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:36,214
You never needed anybody's help,

491
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,383
and you were always ready to give out advice.

492
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:39,984
You had all the answers.

493
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,055
But then, the truth is, I always thought

494
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,958
that was one of the best things about you.

495
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,927
-But what about you? -Huh?

496
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,564
You need to take care of yourself too. Don't you?

497
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:53,898
Myself?

498
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,167
-Hmm. -Not an option?

499
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:59,537
Well, selflessness is one of your best traits. [chuckles]

500
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,373
All right. Since you're my favorite person,

501
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,410
I'll take care of you. Sound good?

502
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,011
[laughing]

503
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,048
[sobbing]

504
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:13,952
Please don't remind me of Biyomon. Not now.

505
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,053
Sora.

506
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,489
-[rustling noise] -Huh?

507
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,525
-[Tai] Something's coming. -[roars]

508
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:22,527
-[Sora] Meicooman. -[both gasp]

509
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,962
[explosion]

510
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,499
[all grunting]

511
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:36,541
[loud rumbling]

512
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,042
[gasps]

513
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,112
[roaring]

514
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,118
It's Machinedramon.

515
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:49,320
[roaring]

516
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,958
-[Tai] Look out! -[Sora screams]

517
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:03,268
-[all panting] -That was close.

518
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,003
[growling]

519
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:08,239
Hey, Matt, you go after Meicooman.

520
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:11,176
[Machinedramon growling]

521
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,044
[Tentamon] Is that another one of your friends, Izzy?

522
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,579
I'm not sure I like this one.

523
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:18,183
That's a friend? I hope he's not hungry.

524
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:20,185
I think we're safe here, you guys,

525
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,587
as long as he doesn't turn this way and see us.

526
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,589
[growling]

527
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:26,558
[roaring]

528
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,561
[all exclaiming]

529
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:32,997
Everybody, take cover!

530
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,366
But wait! Where are Matt and Tai?

531
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,902
Go! I'll get them. I know where they went.

532
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,004
We don't have time to go running around.

533
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:43,041
We have to find a hole to hide in before that thing gets us.

534
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:45,610
I'm scared. Everything's bad since you humans came.

535
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:49,380
Everybody, just relax! Panicking now won't help at all!

536
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:52,083
-Try to stay-- -[Meicooman screams]

537
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:54,619
[Joe] Huh? Is that who I think it is?

538
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,087
Meicooman!

539
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:58,423
Mei! Mei!

540
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:03,228
-I see them. They're safe. -[all panting]

541
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,063
You're all okay.

542
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:06,331
[all sighing]

543
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:11,236
[Tai] That thing is gearing up for something.

544
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,503
[all gasping]

545
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:17,175
[Meicooman] Mei, why did you leave me all alone?

546
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,210
I've never been so scared.

547
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,614
[growling]

548
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,918
[roaring]

549
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:33,258
-Agumon, time to digiball! -Uh.

550
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:34,659
Gabumon!

551
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:36,661
[Gabumon] What is that thing?

552
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:40,064
You, too, Tentomon. Time to level up!

553
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,200
Wait. We don't know what you want!

554
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:45,336
Whatever's supposed to happen, it ain't happening.

555
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,072
[Tai] How about we try it, Gabumon? Digivolve!

556
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:51,075
[TK] All right, Patamon. You know how to do this.

557
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,211
[Joe] Come on digivice, work.

558
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,447
-No dice. -Now what?

559
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:57,615
I thought these would still work,

560
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,485
but if they don't, it means we're stuck at this level.

561
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:04,022
Biyomon, hey, where are you?

562
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,490
[Biyomon panting]

563
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:08,059
Hold up. We need to stay together!

564
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:13,197
[growling]

565
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,302

00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:21,472
[grunting and whimpering]

567
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:41,693
[Tai] Take my hand!

568
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:44,262
[grunting and whimpering]

569
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,497
-[Agumon] Tai! -[Tai] Agumon!

570
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:11,689
[Nishijima] Top secret digital world data.

571
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:15,159
Current coordinates of the Digimon after the reboot?

572
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:16,394
What is all this?

573
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,570
-[Nishijima] Here you go. -[gasps]

574
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:27,505
[Nishijima] Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

575
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,209
Still working on the reboot, huh?

576
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:34,445
Yeah. I think I might be able to contact Tapirmon

577
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:37,248
-if I get it right. -[Nishijima] Huh?

578
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:39,650
But Digieggs can't rehatch.

579
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,519
We both know that.

580
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:45,523
And when the harmonious ones were first born...

581
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:47,658
[Himekawa] Tapirmon was sacrificed.

582
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,227
[gasps]

583
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,329
[Himekawa] And he can never be reborn.

584
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,298
Not the usual way. Of course I know that.

585
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,167
That's why the reboot is the only option now.

586
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,469
I just have to keep working until I can find a way to--

587
00:33:58,503 --> 00:33:59,570
[Nishijima] You need to stop.

588
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,443
I'm not finished.

589
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:10,281
Just stop for now. You need to rest.

590
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:12,116
Then we'll do it together.

591
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:18,322
A new team, me and you as partners.

592
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:19,290

593

00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:28,299
-[gasps] -[laughs harder]

595
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,737
You watch too much TV.

596
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:33,838
[laughs nervously]

597
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,478
But just the same, I appreciate you trying to help me.

598
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:42,146
[grunts]

599
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,516
[Nishijima] So you're telling me there's a chance?

600
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,451
[laughs softly]

601
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:50,421
[Nishijima] Wait, this must be from Gennai.

602
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:54,225
\"If we could harness Meicooman, a reboot might be possible.

603
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,194
I'll give you intel if you're willing to collaborate

604
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:57,595
with King Drasil.\"

605

-King Drasil? -[thud]

606

Who's there?

607
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,435
You can call me...

608
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:06,571
Hackmon.

609
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:12,443
How did I end up here all alone?

610
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:15,613
Hello? [gasps]

611
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,615
There she is.

612
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:19,917
Biyomon!

613
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,420
It's me, Sora!

614
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,524
-Biyomon! Wait up! -Why should I?

615
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,728
-Why won't you leave me alone? -[gasps]

616
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,665
-I'm worried about you. -You're lying!

617
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,701
You're just scared to be out by yourself!

618
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:37,535
You're wrong!

619
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:39,403
Find somebody else to hang out with!

620
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:42,206
I can't! You and I are partners!

621
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,376
Get this through your head! I do not know you!

625
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:58,890
Uh...

626
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:08,966
[Sora] Biyomon, I finally caught up to you.

627
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,668
What's wrong?

628
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:11,936

[Meiko] Sora? Is that you? What are you doing here?

632
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:26,584
Wait! What am I doing here?

633
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:29,287
[gasps]

634
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:33,691
And where exactly is here?

635
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:37,762
[Tai] Guys! Can anybody hear me?

636
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,865
-Mr. Matt! -Agumon!

637

Kari!

638
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:45,636
Oh. I'm all alone.

639
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,672
Well, what am I? Chopped liver?

640
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,308
I feel safer with Mr. Matt.

641

[stirs]

647
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:06,991
[Kari] I'm so glad to see you guys,

648
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:08,392
but what happened?

649
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,795
-Not sure, but at least... -Kari!

650
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:11,829
...you're okay.

651
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:13,431
[giggles]

652
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:17,401
[Kari] I'm fine. Just a little dazed.

653
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,269
[Tai] Me too.

654
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,639
-Where are the others? -I don't know.

655
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,743
Machinedramon just disappeared all of a sudden.

656
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:28,346
A big hole opened up and swallowed him.

657
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:30,514
And when I looked around, I was alone.

658
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:33,718
-Seriously? I was there. -A big hole?

659
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,854
-You think it was a distortion? -Sure looked like it.

660
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:41,092
-It happened just in time. -But where is everybody else?

661
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,293
[Tai] Hmm.

662
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:47,465
[Joe] How did we get all the way up here?

663
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:49,367
It's impossible.

664
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,702
Unless-- unless that distortion

665
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,704
zapped us all to different places!

666
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:57,975
There's no need to worry. We're fine.

667
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,810
And what is that?

668
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:03,914
[Mimi] Just a building. A big, creepy building.

669
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,850
[TK] This is too bizarre.

670
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,386
What happened?

671
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,455
[grunting]

672
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,326
My ankle feels like it's broken.

673
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,428
Huh?

674
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:20,598
I know you.

675
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,435
[Izzy] Welcome to the middle of nowhere.

676
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,770
[Tokomon] Why did we transport here?

677
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:26,904
Weren't we in the woods

678
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:30,441
with that big noisy monster thingy just a second ago?

679
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,076
Where did it go?

680
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:34,679
Pinch me. It's just a dream!

681
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:37,615
[grunts] Maybe, but it still hurts.

682
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,083
It's a painful dream.

683
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:42,053
What do you think? Got any ideas?

684
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:44,588
[Matt] Man, not a clue.

685
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,525
[Sora] Does this really ever work?

686
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:49,560
[Meiko] It's working now. Look.

687
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:52,396
[blowing]

688
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,765
[gasps then coughs]

689
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,404
Now, what were you saying?

690
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:03,708
My bad. I never pictured you as a camper.

691
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,776
My family used to go to the mountains all the time.

692
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,678
When I was a little girl, me and Dad would play

693
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,147
in the woods. We had so much fun.

694
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:14,418
[Sora] Would you like to hear some happy news?

695
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:15,786
Mm-hm.

696
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,888
We saw Meicooman earlier.

697
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,824
She's been looking everywhere for you.

698
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,059
Why didn't you tell me that right from the start?

699
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,327
Oh, I'm so glad.

700
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:28,799
I was afraid she'd forgotten all about me the way Biyomon has.

701
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:29,800
I'm so sorry.

702
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:32,770
It's all right. You were just being honest.

703
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:35,139
And even if Biyomon never remembers me,

704
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:37,041
I'll be okay.

705
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:40,177
Of course you will. You're strong.

706
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,447
-Huh? -[Sora] It's raining fruit.

707
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,949
Are those pears?

708
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:47,551
Yes. Take 'em or leave 'em.

709
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:49,754
-Biyomon, how nice! -Wow!

710
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:51,622
I've got some other stuff here, too.

711
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,160
-Come eat with us. -[scoffs] I don't think so.

712
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:58,562
I've got better things to do.

713
00:39:58,596 --> 00:39:59,630
No problem.

714
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,832
Hey, stop being silly, Biyomon.

715
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:03,934
Come sit by the fire with us.

716
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,904
Plus, you and I have a lot to catch up on.

717
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,439
[grumbles]

718
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:12,810
[gasps]

719
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:14,111
[groans]

720
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:17,481
[Biyomon] Fine, but I don't know you either!

721
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:22,052
Don't get excited. I'm not here as an enemy.

722
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,221
I'm not here as a friend either.

723
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,224
I'm just a messenger sent from Homeostasis,

724
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,594
and I'm here to warn you about Gennai.

725
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:36,066
King Drasil corrupted him and now he's become Dark Gennai.

726
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,603
Gennai always kept the balance between the light and the dark.

727
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,806
That was his function.

728
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,841
Now that he's embraced the dark,

729
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:46,210
the world has begun to fall from the light.

730
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:48,813
The darkness is spreading everywhere.

731
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:49,980
[grunts]

732
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,082
Where's Himekawa?

733
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,051
She entered the Digital World on her own

734
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:56,086
in hopes of finding Tapirmon.

735
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:56,821
[gasps]

736
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,990
Of course, she had King Drasil's help.

737
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,226
He's kept track of her for years.

738
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:04,728
But Drasil has his own agenda.

739
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:07,731
And though Himekawa has joined forces with him,

740
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:09,066
her goals are unimportant.

741
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:15,139
[Nishijima] So that was the real reason for the reboot all along.

742
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,041
She wanted to go back.

743
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,244
You and I have to work together.

744
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:23,113
King Drasil's goal is to stop humans and Digimon

745
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,982
from interacting.

746
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:28,319
We think he's trying to use the Libra to accomplish it.

747
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:30,654
The Libra? Meicooman.

748
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:31,889
Mm-hm.

749
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:34,491
[gasps]

750
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:38,229
[Gennai] Libra is immensely powerful but volatile.

751
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:41,665
If the forces of darkness ever gain control over it,

752
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,702
it will be global destruction.

753
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:48,639
Huh?

754
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:56,680
[Tentomon] Izzy, where are you?

755
00:41:56,714 --> 00:42:00,351
Hello? Hey, you guys!

756
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:04,154
[groans] Being lost is wearing me out.

757
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:09,960
[Tentomon] Izzy, Panomon, Gabumon, Agumon?

758
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:12,329
Oh, Izzy, where are you?

759
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,299
Weird. Why do I keep calling out for Izzy?

760
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:16,967
Because the two of you are partners.

761
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,169
You were like two peas in a pod.

762
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,304
Really?

763
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:22,706
It must have been a very large pod.

764
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,909
I wish Izzy was with us right now.

765
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:28,112
He and his big brain are so good at figuring things out.

766
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:30,681
Whatever you say, but it's your turn to yell now.

767
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,352
[Agumon] That's a pretty picture, Izzy,

768
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,720
but I don't remember it.

769
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:39,723
[Gomamon] Humans sure laugh a lot.

770
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:42,726
[Patamon] Ooh, there we are. Look how young we were.

771
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,729
[Izzy] And here's another picture of you and Joe, Gobumon,

772
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:48,799
and you and Tai, Agumon. See? We were all friends.

773
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:49,867
[Matt grumbles]

774
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:54,705
[Matt] Let's just stop wasting time and get going.

775
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:59,209
[Joe] That looks exactly like Mimi.

776
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,744
You're quite the artist, Palmon.

777
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:02,313
[all laughing]

778
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:18,128
[Meiko] Oh, Sora.

779
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,201
[footsteps approaching]

780
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:30,341
[groans] Meiko.

781
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:35,245
How could you leave me in this horrible place?

782
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,918
[Olegmon] At least it's not broken, TK.

783
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,186
I think you just sprained it.

784
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:45,689
These special leaves will have you all healed up in no time.

785
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:47,257
You're pretty good, Olegmon.

786
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:50,060
You're helping me babysit those little carpet crawlers,

787
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:52,796
so I owed you. Now we're even.

788
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,365
Like old times.

789
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:57,401
You and me and Patamon used to take care of these fellas.

790
00:43:57,434 --> 00:43:59,236
Mm, yeah?

791
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:02,373
You keep saying that, but I still don't remember.

792
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:04,341
[chuckles] Yeah, of course you wouldn't remember.

793
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:06,944
We weren't part of this Digital World.

794
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,713
The thing is, we'll never forget you.

795
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:12,483
I'll always remember the day I meet Patamon

796
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:14,218
and the day I had to say goodbye.

797
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:17,454
You really love him, don't you, this Patamon?

798
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,423
I can't wait to finally meet him.

799
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:20,424
Yeah.

800
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:22,993
I hope we find him soon.

801
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,065
[Agumon] So, you think these tracks will lead us

802
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:30,034
-back to the others? -[Matt] It's possible.

803
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:32,336
If this is the same place I remember,

804
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:35,873
then these tracks will lead us to a lake with a trolley.

805
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:38,442
Though I can't guarantee the DigiWorld hasn't changed

806
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:41,311
I can't wait to hear more of these wild stories

807
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,047
about Joe and studying,

808
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,417
and the girlfriend he says he has and the food he eats

809
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,852
and the weird places he goes to study some more.

810
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:50,821
Do you even want to find them, Matt?

811
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,289
You haven't said a thing about Tai.

812
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:53,824
It's like you don't even like him.

813
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,959
-Next question. -Matt likes Tai a lot.

814
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:58,162
-Don't tell him that. -So you don't like him?

815
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:03,133
[Matt] It's just... we all expect a lot out of Tai.

816
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:07,304
Maybe... maybe more than he has to give us.

817
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:08,338
Hmm?

818
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,407
Hmm?

819
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:11,975
[Matt] Hmm.

820
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:13,277
[Izzy] Hmm.

821
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:16,480
[Gomamon] What's that? It looks like it's coming right at us.

822
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:19,483
I believe what we are experiencing is a mirage.

823
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:21,518
[Gomamon] It looks so real.

824
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,486
[train chugging]

825
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:24,655
[Agumon] And it sounds so real.

826
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:30,127
[chugging gets louder]

827
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:35,232
[Agumon] I'm sure glad it's not real.

828
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:39,136
-[train whistles] -[all screaming]

829
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,905
[train whistles]

830
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:46,944
[all groaning]

831
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:51,381
-Hey, mirage, wait up! -We need a ride!

832
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,916
[Gomamon] It's not stopping!

833
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,118
[Agumon] We'll never catch it now.

834
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:56,120
Well, I guess walking on the train tracks

835
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:57,955
wasn't the best idea we ever had.

836
00:45:57,988 --> 00:45:59,490
[chuckles] Our logic was clearly flawed.

837
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:00,424
It happens.

838
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,392
[Gomamon] What we were talking about

839
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,361
before we nearly got run over?

840
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:06,430
[Agumon] Matt and Tai and how they don't get along.

841
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:07,598
[Gomamon] Oh, that's right.

842
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:09,299
[Matt] I never said we don't get along.

843
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,135
[Izzy] Yeah. Those two are best friends.

844
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:12,136
[Matt] No, we're not!

845
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:14,104
[others laughing]

846
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,382
Shouldn't we be searching for those guys?

847
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:30,554
What are we to you now, since you don't remember us?

848
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:33,590
-Huh? -I don't have any power now.

849
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,026
If Agumon and I are still partners,

850
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,896
then why couldn't I get him to do digivolve?

851
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:40,631
I'm useless here.

852
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:42,132
That's not true.

853
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:46,203
[Tai] I guess the reboot put us at square one.

854
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:49,406
And things aren't going to go back to the way they were...

855
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:50,474
ever.

856
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,211
[Kari] Don't be so sure about that.

857
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:58,348
There's still time, and not everything that happened is bad.

858
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:01,151
I think Salamon is actually happier now.

859
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:03,387
Let's accept our Digimon the way they are.

860
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,423
Their memories might all return eventually.

861
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:09,993
But either way, we'll just keep moving forward.

862
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:11,128
Huh?

863
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:17,968
Well, maybe you're right.

864
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,609
[Biyomon] That girl keeps saying she knows me.

865
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:27,177
Could it be true?

866
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:32,015
[Sora] What am I going to do, Meiko?

867
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:33,317
About Biyomon?

868
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,252
I keep trying to get closer to her,

869
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:38,222
but she just pushes me away.

870
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:40,557
I know none of our partners remember the way things

871
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:46,096
used to be, but still, all the other Digimon,

872
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:47,698
they're all happy with their partners

873
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:49,600
even without any memories of them.

874
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,268
So why not Biyomon?

875
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:56,240
Not only does she not know me, she doesn't want to.

876
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:57,507
Did I do something wrong

877
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,276
or is there just something wrong with me?

878
00:47:59,309 --> 00:47:59,943
Enough of that!

879
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:02,479
There's nothing wrong with you, Sora,

880
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:04,281
and none of this is your fault!

881
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:06,049
Each of us is linked to our Digimon,

882
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,951
and that bond can't be broken.

883
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:09,553
You're the one who taught me that.

884
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:11,488
So stop talking nonsense already!

885
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:12,489
[gasps]

886
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:16,059
[Meiko] Sorry about that.

887
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:19,062
That came out a little harsher than I meant it to.

888
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:20,964
[leaves rustling]

889
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:25,035
I've had my doubts, too.

890
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:29,373
When Meicooman got infected, she changed.

891
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,975
She turned violent and dangerous.

892
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:35,979
But I'm here to find her. I'll never give up on her.

893
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:37,547
-[leaves rustling] -[both] Huh?

894
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:42,052
[gasps] Meicooman?

895
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:43,954
Mei?

896
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:48,125
-Meicooman? I'm so glad-- -[both gasp]

897
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:49,559
[Sora] Meicooman, it's us!

898
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,695
Oh, I know it's you,

899
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:54,665
but what I want to know is why you left me here?

900
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,501
How could you?

901
00:48:57,534 --> 00:49:02,039
How could you leave me alone in this horrible place?

902
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:02,639
[Sora] Look out!

903
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:07,311
All alone! You hate me! I know it!

904
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:11,348
Why else would you do that? You hate me because I got sick!

905
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:13,283
[gasps] You're right.

906
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:15,585
I ran and left you because you got sick.

907
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:18,722
-You were scaring me! -[grunts] Stay away!

908
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:22,125
I thought that the evil had taken you over for good!

909
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:23,527
You left me!

910
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,630
But I'm here now! I came to find you!

911
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:29,733
I'll always come back for you, Meicooman, no matter what!

912
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:32,703
I know you know that because you and I are partners,

913
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:34,237
and I love you.

914
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:38,542
[Meicooman] You love me?

915
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:41,445
I will never leave you alone again.

916
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:44,047
Can you ever forgive me, Meicooman?

917
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:46,216
Please say you can.

918
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:48,185
[Meicooman] I think so. [sobs]

919
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,187
[Meiko] Thank you.

920
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,689
Let's stick together now, you and me.

921
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:56,760
[Meicooman growls]

922
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:58,128
[Meiko] Meicooman!

923
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:02,165
What are you doing here?

924
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:04,067
[chuckles and snaps fingers]

925
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:08,739
-[Meiko] Really? Again? -[Meicooman] Let me down.

926
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:11,575
No way. I'm not losing you again.

927
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:15,479
[rumbling]

928
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:16,546
[gasps]

929
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:19,116
[surge of electricity]

930
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:26,390
[Meicooman] I'll take care of this guy, Meiko.

931
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:28,291
He's here for me.

932
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:31,661
[crash]

933
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,398
-Come back! -Stay here. I'll go get her.

934
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:36,366
-Sora, wait! -[gasps]

935
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:40,837
[both] Huh?

936
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,541
[Gomamon] is that real?

937
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:48,512
[Tai] Another distortion. That's Sora.

938
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,180
She looks like she's in trouble.

939
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:53,717
[Himekawa] Just hold on.

940
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:55,786
I'm coming.

941
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,487
Hold on.

942
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:01,491
[screams]

943
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:04,394
[grunting]

944
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:08,832
[Gennai] The Libra is mine. [chuckles]

945
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:10,233
[Sora] Put her down!

946
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:12,402
The next one will hit you between the eyes!

947
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:15,739
[scoffs]

948
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:18,108
[grunts]

949
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:22,612
[grunting]

950
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:30,253
Ken, let go! What are you doing?

951
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:33,190
Don't assume everything you see is real.

952
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:36,526
Ken is just one of many forms I can take in your world.

953
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:40,096
You're Gennai. Ugh!

954
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:46,303
I have a feeling you're going to like the Gennai that I am now.

955
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:48,472
[laughing]

956
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:50,907
Does that news come as a surprise to you?

957
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:54,678
-Himekawa said it would. -Himekawa?

958
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:56,446
What does she have to do with this?

959
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,482
She and I made a trade for this.

960
00:51:58,515 --> 00:52:01,451
-Give me that! It's mine! -It was yours.

961
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:03,553
And without it, you're nothing!

962
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:04,721
[surge of electricity]

963
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:07,257
[Gennai] Huh?

964
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,559
[Sora] Biyomon?

965
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:13,630
Let her go, you jerk! [grunts]

966
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:14,898
[grunts]

967
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:16,700
Biyomon!

968
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,202
Another little pest.

969
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:21,571
That pest is my partner!

970
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:23,273
Biyomon, are you okay?

971
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,644
Meicoomon, are you hurt? Say something.

972
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:31,281
Oh, man.

973
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,350
I guess you two are going to make me do this

974
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:34,684
the hard way after all.

975
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:37,487
[gasps]

976
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:39,456
[rumbling]

977
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,492
Let me go!

978
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:45,695
[screams]

979
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:50,967
What is this?

980
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:56,373
-They missed. -Huh?

981
00:52:57,407 --> 00:52:59,309
[Sora] You guys are just in time.

982
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,944
You saved us from Machinedramon.

983
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:02,746
Nope. We just showed up.

984
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:04,581
It's true. We didn't do anything.

985
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:05,749
Then who?

986
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:08,485
-[Gabumon] How was that? -Gabumon! Nice!

987
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,020
-[Gabumon] Thanks. -[Agumon] I found you!

988
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:12,756
There you are. Man, am I glad to see you.

989
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:13,657
-Not so hard. -[chewing]

990
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,358
[Joe] Look, you guys. It's a miracle!

991
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:17,561
We're finally back together again!

992
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:19,996
[Izzy] We must have all come through those distortions.

993
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,331
[gasps]

994
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:22,365
Meiko.

995
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:26,970
[gasps] And Meicooman! It's a reunion, you guys.

996
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:28,471
-[rumbling] -Huh?

997
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:29,372
[Tai] Machinedramon!

998
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:31,374
[Gennai laughing] Look at the new targets.

999
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:33,777
[Tai] It's Gennai. What are you doing here?

1000
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:34,978
[Gennai grunts]

1001
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,381
I'm here for the one you call Meicooman.

1002
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:42,786
But let's have some fun first. Let's see who runs and who dies.

1003
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:44,588
[explosions]

1004
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:46,990
I think Gennai must have gone crazy.

1005
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:48,992
Maybe that's not really Gennai at all.

1006
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:50,794
Oh, I'm Gennai all right,

1007
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:52,829
but I've had a little change of heart.

1008
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:54,798
I'm on the Digimon side.

1009
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:55,999
[Matt] What are you talking about?

1010
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:56,967
[Joe] So are we!

1011
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,002
[Gennai] That's what you say, but it's a lie.

1012
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:02,405
Humans and Digimon should have never met up in the first place.

1013
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:04,708
You've done nothing but interfere with their lives

1014
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,309
from the very beginning!

1015
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:08,011
[panting] They all chose to be with us.

1016
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:09,646
What's he mean, TK?

1017
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:12,949
When Homeostasis chose you, instead of honoring them

1018
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:15,885
and helping them, you enslaved them.

1019
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:19,022
Then when the infection began and you started losing control,

1020
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:20,790
you did just what King Drasil wanted,

1021
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:23,493
and you performed the reboot! [laughing]

1022
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:25,695
So the reboot is...

1023
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:28,531
All part of the master plan. [snaps fingers]

1024
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:29,966
[all gasping]

1025
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,001
[rumbling]

1026
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:33,570
-[Salomon grunts] -[Kari] Puppy!

1027
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:34,838
[echoing screams]

1028
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:42,545
-[all clamoring] -[Joe] Let's get out of here!

1029
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:45,448
[low grumbling sound]

1030
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,657
[Izzy] Machinedramon's too big to use a gangplank.

1031
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:56,459
So we should be safe aboard this old ship for a while.

1032
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:58,828
[TK] Can we start this wreck up and sail out of here?

1033
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:00,764
[Izzy] It looks like the engines are shut.

1034
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,599
I'll try, but it doesn't look good.

1035
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,067
[Tentomon] It's hard to believe something this big

1036
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,168
could ever move.

1037
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:08,571
[Kari] Salamon, it was dangerous to attack like that.

1038
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,740
[Salomon] But I had to do something, Kari.

1039
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:12,742
Machinedramon was trying to hurt you.

1040
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:16,780
-Mei. -What is it? Are you hurt?

1041
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,416
You have to let me go off on my own.

1042
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:21,718
That guy will never stop chasing me.

1043
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:23,586
Is that what you're worried about?

1044
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,789
Meicooman, you don't have to be alone.

1045
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:28,058
You have all of us on your side, but you guys--

1046
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:30,794
-[both] Huh? -This is our fault.

1047
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:33,530
And I'm so very sorry you all got mixed up in it.

1048
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:35,598
[Mimi] Don't be ridiculous, Mei Mei.

1049
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:37,100
You heard Dark Gennai,

1050
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:38,968
so now we know who's behind all this.

1051
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,403
[TK] Mm-hm.

1052
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:41,538
King Drasil.

1053
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:44,107
-[thud] -[both gasp]

1054
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:47,410
[all screaming]

1055
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:48,812
He found us already?

1056
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,881
-That was scary! -Is he gonna take our boat?

1057
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:53,016
[TK] I'll take care of you.

1058
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:57,721
Oh, great! We're trapped just like rats on this ship!

1059
00:55:57,754 --> 00:55:59,155
Yeah, but we can't get off!

1060
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,424
Not with Machinedramon just waiting for us.

1061
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:03,493
[Tentomon] What if we fool him into looking the wrong way

1062
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:04,794
-for a minute? -Yeah.

1063
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:06,196
One of us could fake him out.

1064
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:08,832
Someone would have to volunteer. But who?

1065
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,433
[Tentomon] I'll do it, Izzy.

1066
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:13,770
No. It should be me and Tai.

1067
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:16,906
And I volunteer too, as long as there's food.

1068
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,842
-One-track mind. -[thud]

1069
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,643
[screaming]

1070
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:23,046
[Sora] That was even closer. He's almost found the range.

1071
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:24,781
Meicooman can hide here!

1072
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:27,650
The rest of us have to draw him away by getting off the ship.

1073
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:29,219
[Sora] Go! I'll stay here with Meiko.

1074
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:30,086
[Matt] Tai, come with me.

1075
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,888
We'll jump off the back of the ship.

1076
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:33,456
[Tai] Right. Move it, Agumon.

1077
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:34,524
[Kari] I'm coming with you.

1078
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:37,694
Hmm.

1079
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,231
Decoys, huh?

1080
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:43,666
Oldest trick in the book. [snaps fingers]

1081
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:47,237
I'll just send them a little playmate. MetalSeadramon!

1082
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:48,805
[panting]

1083
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:49,839
[gasping]

1084
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:57,480
[Gennai] Time to take care of the rest. [chuckles]

1085
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:59,115
[all screaming]

1086
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,256
[Tentomon] Well, we're off the ship. Now what, Izzy?

1087
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:07,891
Time to destroy that thing.

1088
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,859
I'm making a hologram to trick Gennai.

1089
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,862
-There. -[TK] Do it.

1090
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:15,665
Run!

1091
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:18,134
-[surge of electricity] -[Mimi screams]

1092
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:19,636
Thanks for the warning!

1093
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,673
Come out, come out wherever you are.

1094
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,643
[distant explosion]

1095
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:29,579
-[grunts] -[Sora] It's okay, Biyomon.

1096
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,114
[Biyomon] I don't need you to comfort me.

1097
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:34,517
I'm just doing whatever I can think of to help.

1098
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:36,920
You should have done what I told you.

1099
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,055
Taking care of yourself instead of annoying me

1100
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:40,924
and following me around everywhere.

1101
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:41,991
That's mean.

1102
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:44,093
I'm not being mean.

1103
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:47,230
I just want you to face reality.

1104
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:49,232
[Sora] Oh, I'm sorry.

1105
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:51,801
You can't help it.

1106
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:54,070
You're just a gentle spirit, Sora.

1107
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:55,104
[gasps]

1108
00:57:57,674 --> 00:58:01,878
Biyomon, you called me by my name.

1109
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:04,013
Yeah, what's the big deal?

1110
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:07,717
It's just that I figured I'd better be nicer to you

1111
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,686
if I wanted more of those meatballs.

1112
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:11,254
-[Sora] [laughing] -[distant explosion]

1113
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:12,956
-Oh. -Now what?

1114
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,624
Stay with Meicooman.

1115
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,793
I've got to make sure those guys are okay.

1116
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:22,332
[Gennai] You pathetic humans are such easy targets.

1117
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:25,835
It's your constant fear of death that makes you this way.

1118
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:28,805
The Digimon on the other hand, are eternal.

1119
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:32,575
In the form of digieggs, they can always be reborn.

1120
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:34,677
Well, if they're not contaminated

1121
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:36,613
by your human world.

1122
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:39,148
If a Digimon's life ends in the human world,

1123
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,985
it can never reincarnate. How sad.

1124
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:44,220
[screaming]

1125
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:47,257
[Gennai] That's why the reboot was such a brilliant idea.

1126
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:50,026
All Digimon who died on the other side

1127
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:53,897
can be reincarnated. Now, at last, the Digimon

-Right, Meicooman? -Meicooman?

1130
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:00,603
Yes.

1131
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:02,972
She's the key to eradicating you all.

00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,647

Poison ivy!

1143
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:29,632
-That was fantastic, Palmon. -I know, right?

1144
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:32,735
Good fishing, Gomamon! That was awesome!

1145
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:34,804
[Gomamon] What would you do without me, Joe?

1146
00:59:34,837 --> 00:59:38,107
[Sora] You guys, are you okay? [panting]

1147
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:40,710
Hmm. Now, time's up.

1148
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:42,645
Uh-oh.

1149
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:45,648
-[screaming] -[Mimi] He's back!

1150
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:47,951
Hey, ugly. Look up here.

1151
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:49,786
Tentomon leveled up to giant size,

1152
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:52,255
and he's about to crush you like a bug!

1153
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:54,724
[Gennai] Not if I vaporize him first.

1154
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,970
-Gabumon, can you take this guy? -You got it.

1155
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:10,840
[Gabumon shouts]

1156
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,810
[MetalSeadramon growling]

1157
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,881
[Matt] Whoa! You did it, Gabumon!

1158
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:22,218
[Gabumon] Yeah. What was that big thing?

1159
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:24,887
That was MetalSeadramon. Nice job.

1160
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:27,690
Thanks, little Matt. Can I call you that?

1161
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:29,258
-Little? -[Tai] Yeah.

1162
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,227
Gabumon wanted a special name for you,

1163
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:33,296
and I told him you like to be called little.

1164
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:37,000
-[Gabumon] Yeah. -[Matt] Tai, you are such an--

1165

-[screaming -[MetalSeadramon growling]

1166
01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:43,940
[Kari] Matt, Tai! Are you okay?

1167
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:47,777
[Gabumon] Little Matt. Tai! Where are you?

1168
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,879

[laughs]

1171
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:59,088
[Himekawa] Tapirmon, I finally found you!

1172
01:00:59,122 --> 01:00:59,989
Hmm?

1173
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:03,426
[Himekawa] Aren't you glad to see me too?

1174
01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:06,796
[giggles] We're together again.

1175
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,798
I missed you so much.

1176
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:12,235
[Tapirmon] Are you a human? Hmm?

1177
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:15,338
Uh... I am, and I'm your partner.

1178
01:01:15,371 --> 01:01:18,174
-We're a team. -[Tapirmon] No, we're not.

1179
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:22,111
[grunts] I don't know you, and I don't want to!

1180
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:23,713
Now leave me alone!

1181
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:27,050
[gasps]

1182
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:31,020
[Himekawa] Tapirmon, you may not remember me yet

1183
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:32,789
or believe that we're partners...

1184
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:38,161
but it's true all the same and now that I've found you,

1185
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:40,329
I'll never lose you again!

1186
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:07,757
[screaming]

1187
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:13,162
[Agumon] Tai, I need to know something.

1188
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:16,399
[Tai] Agumon?

1189
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:17,266
Is that you?

1190
01:02:18,634 --> 01:02:21,337
[Agumon] Why did you guys come back here to the Digital World?

1191
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:24,907
[Tai] I had to. I had to see you again.

1192
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:28,111
[Agumon] But weren't you all taking an awful big chance?

1193
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:30,012
What if you didn't find us?

1194
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:32,515
What if something else went wrong?

1195
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:33,916
[Tai] I couldn't lose you again.

1196
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:39,322
The only reason I came back to this world was to find you.

1197
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:44,060
We're meant for each other.

1198
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:47,330
We were all destined to be together.

1199
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:49,532
-Gabumon! -Agumon!

1200
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:52,268
[Agumon] Tai, I want to be more powerful .

1201
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:53,903
[Gabumon] Me too, Matt.

1202
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:57,039
[grunting]

1203
01:02:57,974 --> 01:03:00,977
Gabumon, digivolve!

1204
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,979
[Tai] Agumon, digivolve!

1205
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:07,550
[Kari] Tai, brother, where are you?

1206
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:09,986
I don't know what to do!

1207
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:13,890

1210
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:22,265
Huh? Oh no.

1211
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:25,935
Oh, what now?

1212
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:31,140
-Sorry to make you wait. -Tai, you're here.

1213
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:33,943
Look who's back!

[Kari exclaims]

1217
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:21,190
Are we doomed?

1218
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:36,606
[Kari] Salamon, digivolve too!

1219
01:04:56,492 --> 01:04:58,394
[Gatomon] Gatomon!

-Hey, you okay, Kari? -Gatomon?

1222
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:14,977
Man, it's good to see him.

1223
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:17,113
Yeah, you got that right.

1224
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:19,682
I thought it might never happen again.

1225
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:21,484
[laughing

1226
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:23,286
[Tentomon] Did you guys see how big I was?

1227
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:26,088
Yeah, but how? Because now you're small again.

1228
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:28,324
That was a hologram of a giant Tentomon,

1229
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:31,694
but it fooled Machinedramon into blasting ice down onto himself.

1230
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:33,696
Well done. You're amazing.

1231
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:36,532
-I'd call it pro digits. -[TK] Guys.

1232
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:37,700
[Kari] What is it, TK?

1233
01:05:37,733 --> 01:05:40,503
[TK] If Machinedramon breaks out, we'd better be ready.

1234
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:43,406
I'm ready to go if you need a partner.

1235
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,608
[Joe] It's good to have you back Gabumon.

1236
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:49,111
-You're the only partner for me. -[laughs]

1237
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:51,547
[Kari] The same goes for us, Palmon.

1238
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:54,483
Sora, what's this partner thing again?

1239
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,786
-What? -You know, partners?

1240
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:59,322
You said we made a great team together.

1241
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:00,356

[Biyoman] You have to save yourself, Sora.

1256
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:40,396
There's only one thing left to try.

1257
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:42,398
-[Biyoman] What? -Are you with me?

1258
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:43,799
Huh?

1259
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:46,402
It could work. But I need you to help.

1260
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:47,436
And do what?

1261
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:51,073
Level up. Can you take my hand?

1262
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:52,608
[grunts] Okay.

1263
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:10,559

[Machinedramon growling]

1271
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:28,571
[Joe] Look, Phoenixmon rescued Sora.

1272
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:31,173
[Sora] You did it.

1273
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:42,685
[Meiko] Wow, that's Phoenixmon.

1274
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:46,422
I'm glad all your friends left. This is much better.

Hey.

1278
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:54,263
I've been waiting for this for a long time.

1279
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:56,198
So much is about to happen.

1280
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:59,502
Just relax. It'll all be over soon.

[Machinedramon growling]

She's digivolved.

01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:10,246
A Mega digivolve! That's Phoenixmon for sure,

1284
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:12,414
Biyomon's Mega form!

[Sora screaming]

1289
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:24,260
-How can I level up? -You sure you want to?

1290
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:27,229
Who wouldn't want that power? Do you know how?

1291
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:30,232
[Mimi] Go for it, TK.

1292
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:35,538
Hmm.

1293
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:51,520
Patamon, digivolve too!

1294

1299
01:11:04,526 --> 01:11:06,495
[Izzy] Another Mega digivolution.

1300
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:08,497
[Tentomon] Izzy, I wanna digivolve too,

1301
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:10,032
but I don't know how to do it.

1302
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:12,735
-Do I have a Mega form? -Yeah, you bet!

1303
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:14,470
-Can we do it? -Sure.

1304
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:16,672
Come in here close to me, and I'll use this.

1305
01:11:16,705 --> 01:11:17,673
Oh, great.

1306
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:33,022
Tentomon, digivolve too!

1307
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:56,712
Kabuterimon!

1308
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,956

[Izzy] That'll finish him.

1317
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:20,028
Nice job!

1318
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:25,501
I'm worn out. That was hard. I think I need a rest.

-Tokomon. -Yay! We did it, didn't we, TK?

1322
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:34,076
[laughs]

1323
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:36,445
Hmm?

1324
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:41,083
[Joe] I think Phoenixmon is reverting into Yokomon.

1325
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:46,922
[giggling]

1326
01:13:48,223 --> 01:13:51,860
You were great. You okay? Was that a little scary?

1327
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:56,131
I'm just glad I could help a little.

1328
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:58,634
Maybe next time you can get in there too, Koromon.

1329
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:00,636
Yeah, don't rush me. I will.

1330
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:03,806
Palmon, we can digivolve you next time, too. Okay?

1331
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:05,707
[Palmon] You got it!

1332
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:08,076
[grunting]

1333
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:13,849
One thing I've learned is that Digimon can digivolve

1334
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:16,151
by other means than a digivice.

1335
01:14:16,185 --> 01:14:19,054
Another way is to use shear anger.

1336

[growling]

1337
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:25,527
And what could make Meicooman more furious

1338
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:28,697
than having to watch her human partner suffer?

1339
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:31,733
That's it, Meicooman, let the fury burn inside you!

1340
01:14:31,767 --> 01:14:34,536
Give yourself up to the transformation!

-[grunting] -[Gennai] Let the anger bloom!

[Gennai] Digivolve or your partner dies.

1346
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:51,920
Digivolve into your true form and then destroy this world,

1347
01:14:51,954 --> 01:14:55,023
this world into which you should never have been born

Yeah, all good.

You should have seen it, Tai!

1352
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:03,966
We totally destroyed Machinedramon.

1353
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:07,569
-Well, it was a group effort. -Sora.

1354
01:15:07,603 --> 01:15:10,272
You guys okay? Glad you're here.

1355
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:12,774
[Matt] I think Tai has something he wants to say to you.

[Mimi] Well, you can talk on the way.

[Tai] I'm sorry I didn't listen before,

but I really wanna help
