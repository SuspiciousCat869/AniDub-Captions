1
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:21,271
(sweeping orchestral music)

2
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,254
- [Narrator] Once upon
a time, as they say,

3
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:51,216
long before the time of
Syrius and his Fire Child,

4
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,428
the gods of fire and water lived as one,

5
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,555
as brother and sister.

6
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,684
And the earth rested in
a misty nimbus of peace.

7
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:09,152
But like many fairy tales, ours
begins with an act of evil.

8
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,072
For Algorac, the Dark Lord of the Winds,

9
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,824
grew jealous of the happy pair.

10
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,702
And he planted the wicked
thorns of suspicion

11
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,455
and hatred between them.

12
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,751
The thorns took root, and
turned brother against sister.

13
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:30,547
Great Oceanus, King of the
Waters, rose up in a fury

14
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,801
and sent his waves
raging around the globe.

15
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,053
So mighty that they even threatened

16
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:39,682
the great Palace of
Hyperia, Queen of Fire.

17
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,481
(waves crashing)

18
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,650
The earth was in chaos

19
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:53,362
and fire and water were split asunder.

20
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,073
Never to be rejoined.

21
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,246
- [Voices] Hyperia, Hyperia!

22
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,998
Save us from the sea!

23
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,253
- Oceanus is responsible.

24
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:14,007
Algorac has turned him against me.

25
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:17,052
They want to extinguish my flame

26
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:20,098
and wipe me from the face of the earth.

27
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,524
(waves crashing)

28
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,114
They will not succeed.

29
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,116
My flame will live.

30
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:43,203
My children, gather your
fires and come with me!

31
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,874
(tone warbling)

32
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,765
The storm is dead.

33
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,767
The earth is calm.

34
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,353
This Holy Flame must be watched well.

35
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,981
For as long as it burns,
the sea will be calm

36
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,026
and the children of fire shall live.

37
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,410
(sweeping orchestral music)

38
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,898
(soft piano music)

39
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,155
(subdued music)

40
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,424
(yawns)

41
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,745
(yawns)

42
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,417
(yawning)

43
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,006
(sighs)

44
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,019
(playful music)

45
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,739
- Wake up!

46
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,160
Wake up!

47
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:37,122
Up and at 'em.

48
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:42,128
Good morning!

49
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,255
Ooh.

50
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,716
(grunting)

51
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,427
(blows raspberries)

52
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,514
- Hey, calm down, you little tadpole.

53
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,099
- Morning.

54
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,644
- [Seahorse] Bibble, be quiet.

55
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,605
- [Seahorse] For goodness sakes.

56
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:02,939
Stop making so much noise!

57
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,024
Wait, where are you going?

58
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:04,859
Bibble, stop!

59
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,443
- Yoo-hoo, Syrius!

60
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,444
Wake up!

61
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,946
You promised to take me hunting!

62
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:10,781
- [Seahorse] Bibble, shush up.

63
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,032
Don't wake up the prince.

64
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,325
- [Seahorse] Prince
Syrius needs his sleep.

65
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,661
He gave the strictest
orders not to be disturbed.

66
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,497
- [Bibble] He did?

67
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,331
- [Seahorse] Well, he would've if he

68
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,248
hadn't been so tired last night.

69
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,083
- Oh, be quiet.

70
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,584
He promised he'd take me hunting.

71
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,628
It's time he got up anyway.

72
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,671
Oh, there you are.

73
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,674
Hey, let's go catch ourselves a jellyfish.

74
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,926
Look at what I've come up with.

75
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,679
He won't stand a chance against this.

76
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,598
(laughs)

77
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,267
- You'll have to do a lot
better than that, Bibble.

78
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,685
- Let go, come on!

79
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,686
Let go!

80
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,691
- Well, what are you waiting for?

81
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,903
If you beat me there,
I'll give you my knife.

82
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,779
- Oh, here I come!

83
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,116
Last one there is a sea slug!

84
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,409
- They're going to get themselves

85
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,203
into trouble someday, I tell you.

86
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,830
- It's most distressing.

87
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,501
(subdued music)

88
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,859
(Bibble sneezes)

89
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,286
- Ow!

90
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,120
Hey, what the?

91
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,287
Oh, It's you, Bibble.

92
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,247
You're still with me, huh?

93
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,748
Okay, okay.

94
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:25,749
Let go, let go.

95
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,964
In the name of King Oceanus,
I hereby dub you Sir Bibble.

96
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,302
Knight-errant and protector
of the Water People.

97
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,766
Now, to prove your worthiness,

98
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:46,145
you must fight and destroy
that creature of darkness.

99
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,772
- Yikes!

100
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,023
- Here is the knife you wanted.

101
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,066
Now, now, Sir Bibble.

102
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,817
Go on, go on.

103
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,818
- But, but, I...

104
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,863
Syrius!

105
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,116
(grunting)

106
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,455
Here goes nothing!

107
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:09,959
Take that!

108
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,880
- Have at him, brave Sir Bibble!

109
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,424
(yelling)

110
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,053
Don't worry, I think
you're tiring him out!

111
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,596
- Syrius, Syrius!

112
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:22,431
- Use your knife!

113
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,391
- [Bibble] I can't!

114
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,266
I can't!

115
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,142
- What's wrong, Sir Bibble?

116
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:29,688
- You can have your knife
back, anything, only help me!

117
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,272
Help!
- Help you?

118
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,649
Well, why didn't you say so?

119
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,650
Wee!

120
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,325
(grunting)

121
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,377
Not so fast!

122
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,629
- Wait for me!

123
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,383
(dramatic music)

124
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,184
(gasps)

125
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,228
It's the Forbidden Zone!

126
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,855
- Wait here.

127
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:12,856
- Syrius!

128
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,320
(gasps)

129
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,740
He's disappeared.

130
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,380
(creatures chittering)

131
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,864
(growling)

132
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:08,745
- Aha.

133
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,178
Geronimo!

134
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,272
Huh?

135
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,778
(whistles)

136
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,665
(grunts)

137
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,545
(subdued music)

138
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,298
Oh.

139
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,950
Huh?

140
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,179
What was that?

141
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,952
(grunting)

142
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,185
- Syrius, why'd you do it?

143
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,229
Now, I'll never see you again.

144
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,024
Huh?
(bats screeching)

145
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,194
(yelling)

146
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:48,905
Help!

147
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:54,494
What a way to go, and I was
only looking for some fun.

148
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,454
Some friend you are!

149
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,791
How could you leave me here?

150
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,670
Help, help!

151
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,422
I'm too young to die!

152
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,344
Syrius!

153
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,014
Syrius!

154
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,433
Come on, come on!

155
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,363
(panting)

156
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,285
Syrius!

157
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,494
Syrius, wake up!

158
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,620
Wake up!

159
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,955
Huh?

160
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,499
No, you can't be dead!

161
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,500
No!

162
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,588
(crying)

163
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,092
Prince Syrius is dead!

164
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,722
Huh?

165
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,891
(yelling)

166
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,521
(coughing)

167
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,400
(sighs)

168
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,694
Are you all right, Syrius?

169
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,446
It serves you right,

170
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,074
running off into the
Forbidden Zone like that.

171
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:19,996
- I dreamed that I saw something.

172
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,040
(grunting)

173
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,875
I saw a fire.

174
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,876
- You what?

175
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,795
You saw a fire?

176
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,381
- And a girl beside it.

177
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:31,800
- Come on.

178
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:32,842
Come on, let's go.

179
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,302
This sounds like trouble.

180
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,180
Let's get out of this place, Syrius.

181
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,014
Syrius!

182
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,143
Syrius!

183
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,021
Syrius, come on, let's go!

184
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:49,901
Whoa!

185
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,452
(yelling)

186
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,333
(grunting)

187
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,303
Huh?

188
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,306
(sighs)

189
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,102
- Hurry up, hurry up for goodness sake!

190
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,687
(lighthearted music)

191
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,688
Don't move.

192
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,239
- Let me just fluff this a
little for you, Your Highness.

193
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,240
- He looks beautiful.

194
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,324
- Pretty as a picture.

195
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,827
- And now for the finishing touches.

196
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,872
There, and there, and there.

197
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,875
Well, what do you think?

198
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,712
(sneezes)

199
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,465
Sorry, Your Highness.

200
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,386
(march-like music)

201
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,222
- Huh?

202
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,808
Hey Syrius, what's the big idea?

203
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,935
Going to a costume party?

204
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,645
- Costume party, indeed.

205
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,021
This is the prince's 16th birthday

206
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:12,024
and we're going to his
coronation, you little ruffian.

207
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,359
- Coronation?

208
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,443
- That's right, Bibble.

209
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,696
We're off to pay our
respects to King Oceanus.

210
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,780
Hop aboard.

211
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:18,865
- Jumping jellyfish.

212
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:19,866
What fun!

213
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,870
Come on, we're going to see the king!

214
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,290
(chattering)

215
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,129
It's Prince Syrius' coronation!

216
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,465
(chattering)

217
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,052
Come on, everybody!

218
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,429
- What did he say?

219
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,430
- The king!

220
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,101
- Hey!

221
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,899
Syrius, here we come!

222
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,986
Come on, everybody!

223
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,493
Let's go!

224
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,094
- [Oceanus] There is no
place on earth as beautiful

225
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:25,306
or as happy as our Kingdom of the Sea.

226
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,768
And it is because of your
brave efforts, Syrius,

227
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,729
that the world beneath the
waves has remained peaceful

228
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,607
and calm these many years.

229
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,109
There is only one way
in which we can repay

230
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,820
your noble service to your king.

231
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:44,660
And so, Prince Syrius, we give
you what is rightfully yours.

232
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,579
- The Eye of Algorac.

233
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,498
- [Oceanus] Yes.

234
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:53,084
The ancient eye taken from
the evil Lord of the Winds,

235
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,796
who now sleeps in the depths
of the Forbidden Zone.

236
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:01,801
From this day forward, you
shall rule the sea in my place.

237
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:06,138
But I warn you, Syrius, do not
go near the Forbidden Zone.

238
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:09,141
Without his eye, Algorac is powerless.

239
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,310
But if he should ever get it back again,

240
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,648
evil will return to the
sea, and the whole world.

241
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,110
(yawns)

242
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:20,736
- Oceanus!

243
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,866
- [Oceanus] The future of
our kingdom and its people

244
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:29,454
is now in your hands, Prince Syrius.

245
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,624
See that you guard it well.

246
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,004
- Syrius, you're the king!

247
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,922
You're the King of the Sea!

248
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:40,923
Hooray!

249
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,801
(cheering)

250
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,887
- Hooray for King Syrius!

251
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,058
(cheering)

252
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:58,107
(roaring)

253
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,693
(laughing)

254
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,529
- What's this I hear?

255
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,158
Syrius is the King of the Sea

256
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,285
and wearing the Eye of Algorac?

257
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,245
Ha, it's a joke!

258
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,872
It's a scream!

259
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,249
(laughing)

260
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,459
Now listen, everybody.

261
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,587
Who should be king, this
snotty nosed sea snail

262
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,423
or me, Mugwug the Magnificent?

263
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:26,177
Everyone who prefers
Syrius, take a step forward.

264
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,261
- Yeah!
- Come on!

265
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,764
Put your dukes up.

266
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,307
- Huh, what's this?

267
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,683
Nobody?

268
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,561
(laughing)

269
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,104
Can't say I'm surprised.

270
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,189
You see, Syrius.

271
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,483
The public prefers Mugwug.

272
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,318
- You're out of your gourd.

273
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,444
- Huh?

274
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,946
- Well, to begin with, who'd want a king

275
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,657
that looks like a soggy hamburger?

276
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,159
- Hamburger?

277
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:55,873
That's the rudest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

278
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,249
Get him, boys.

279
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,585
- You got it, boss.
- No problem.

280
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,838
(grunting)

281
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:07,343
- Now, Syrius, why don't you
just hand this over, huh?

282
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,886
Come on, give it to me.

283
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,097
- I'll give you this.

284
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,056
(growls)

285
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,974
And that and that.

286
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,394
- Now, I'm mad!

287
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,730
(Mugwug yelling)

288
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,565
- [Syrius] Here you go!

289
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,567
(Mugwug yelling)

290
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,319
- Huh?
- What the?

291
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,362
- [Fish] We're coming, master!

292
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,280
Don't leave, don't leave!

293
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,280
Wait!

294
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,659
- Come on back and we'll do it again!

295
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,494
Right?

296
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,328
- Hey, right.

297
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,580
(cheering)

298
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,135
(moaning)

299
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,313
(sighs)

300
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,239
(yells)

301
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,910
(sighs)

302
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,752
(sighs) Only a dream.

303
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:27,090
(soft orchestral music)

304
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,171
(laughs)

305
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,061
- Oh, Malta, my daughter.

306
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,063
You're here already.

307
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,690
You are as steadfast as you are beautiful.

308
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,068
And the sea remains calm and peaceful,

309
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,987
only because you are
there night after night

310
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,407
to keep the holy flame from going out.

311
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,034
- Of course, Mother.

312
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:41,747
You may sleep soundly and
depend on me as always.

313
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:44,750
- You are already talking
like a queen, my child.

314
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:47,962
But listen, Malta, there is one
thing you must never forget.

315
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,882
Always be on your guard against
the children of the water.

316
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,260
For they are not our friends.

317
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:57,555
In fact, and you must remember this,

318
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:01,058
- [Both] The water is
the enemy of the flame.

319
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,059
- How could I forget it?

320
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,645
I hear it every night, Mother.

321
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,689
- Malta.

322
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,024
- (laughs) You know you don't have

323
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:11,236
to worry on that account, Mother.

324
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,488
Anyway, you don't think
I'd want to make friends

325
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:17,533
with any of those silly
Water People, do you?

326
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:21,663
- No, but just make sure that
you never forget that, Malta.

327
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:23,915
- I won't.

328
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,791
I know where my duty lies.

329
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:26,959
Goodnight, Mother.

330
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,960
- Goodnight.

331
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:34,676
And good fortune go with
you always, my daughter.

332
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,263
(subdued music)

333
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,792
(water dripping)

334
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:17,593
- Who was that boy who came
from the sea last night?

335
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:18,802
Oh, no.

336
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,180
I must be careful.

337
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,645
I'm supposed to be the brave
daughter of the Queen of Fire.

338
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,606
There's nothing to be afraid of.

339
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,568
(gasps)

340
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,659
Oh, what a coward I am.

341
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,911
I'm a hopeless coward.

342
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:44,788
- [Voice] You sure are.

343
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:45,872
Shame on you.

344
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,044
- Ah!

345
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:51,961
Who is it?

346
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:52,962
Who's there?

347
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:56,883
Piale.

348
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:58,884
- Piale, that's right.

349
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,594
- You're not supposed to be here.

350
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,762
Get back to the palace.

351
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:02,888
- I want to stay.

352
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,307
Piale loves Malta.

353
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:06,850
- Don't be ridiculous.

354
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,519
Get back to the palace.

355
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,687
- No!

356
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,023
Let me stay with you, just for tonight.

357
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,527
Besides, you need Piale.

358
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,780
You're afraid to be alone, aren't you?

359
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,989
- Oh, you!

360
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,075
I'm not afraid of anything, you hear me?

361
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,035
(Piale laughing)

362
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,285
Piale, be careful.

363
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,871
You'll die if you fall in the water.

364
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,123
♪ Malta is a scaredy cat. ♪

365
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,457
♪ Malta is a scaredy cat. ♪

366
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,251
- What a little idiot.

367
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,962
I don't care if you do fall in.

368
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,213
- [Piale] Oh, Malta.

369
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,632
Don't be angry with Piale.

370
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,592
Please, don't be angry.

371
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:41,593
Malta?

372
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,345
Malta?

373
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:45,973
- Look.

374
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,728
How beautiful it is.

375
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:56,066
When fire and water are joined
together, why is it so...

376
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,069
(gasps)

377
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,322
- What?

378
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,949
- We must've been put under a magic spell.

379
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,950
- Huh?

380
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:10,248
- They tried to lure us
under the water just then.

381
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,293
But it won't happen again.

382
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,921
I won't let them get the best of me.

383
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,729
(clearing throat)

384
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,856
(crowing)

385
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,859
(yawns)

386
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:50,788
- Syrius!

387
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,789
Syrius!

388
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,626
Hey, have you guys seen Prince Syrius?

389
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,169
- [All] Huh-uh.

390
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,004
- Have you seen Prince Syrius anywhere?

391
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,297
(cooing)

392
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,758
I bet you guys haven't seen
him around either, huh?

393
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,468
- [All] Huh-uh.

394
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,597
- Syrius, where are you?

395
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,933
Suffering Sargasso.

396
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,268
He's left me in the lurch again.

397
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,103
Whoa!

398
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:16,772
- If you're going to dance on my head,

399
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,107
do you have to make so much noise?

400
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,359
- Sorry, Aries Turtle.

401
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,693
I didn't know it was you.

402
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,029
It's just that Syrius
has got me so steamed.

403
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,573
He ran off without me again.

404
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:29,868
- Little one, the prince has
a lot on his mind these days.

405
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,745
Perhaps, he doesn't have as much time

406
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,163
for his little friends anymore.

407
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:33,998
- Oh, yeah?

408
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:34,833
Well, I'll show him!

409
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:37,085
(laughing)

410
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,693
(rumbling)

411
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,170
- There.

412
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,884
(subdued music)

413
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,893
(gasps)

414
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:51,284
(water splashes)

415
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,621
(gasps)

416
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,009
Tell me, who are you?

417
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:09,844
- Huh?

418
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,262
- Are you a Fire Child?

419
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,096
- Mm-hmm.

420
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:16,016
- You don't look much like a savage.

421
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:19,561
- (gasps) What do you mean a savage?

422
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,730
What an idea.

423
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,358
Who are you to call me a savage?

424
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,901
- My name's Syrius.

425
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,736
I'm a Water Child.

426
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:28,737
- [Malta] A Water Child?

427
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,615
One of the accursed race.

428
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,866
- [Syrius] What accursed race?

429
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,786
Is there a curse on me?

430
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,998
(Syrius grunting)

431
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,085
- Wait, don't go.

432
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,254
Stay for a little while.

433
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,051
Here.

434
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:51,252
We're far from the flame here.

435
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,347
(yelling)

436
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,473
(water splashes)

437
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,851
(Malta laughing)

438
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:00,852
Syrius.

439
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:04,022
Is that what you said your name was?

440
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,816
Mine's Malta.

441
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,817
- Malta?

442
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,403
- Mm-hmm.

443
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,655
- That's a funny name.

444
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,074
- Oh, what manners you have.

445
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:16,868
Well, not everyone
thinks it's a funny name.

446
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,413
They call me Malta of the Flame.

447
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,082
Malta the Fair, Malta the Fabulous.

448
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,251
- Tell me, what is Malta the Marvelous

449
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,795
doing in a place like this?

450
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,173
- I must protect the Holy
Flame from ever dying.

451
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,760
(subdued music)

452
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,932
(sighs)

453
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:43,146
That is why no child of
water is allowed here.

454
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,565
But for you, I'll make an exception.

455
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:50,486
Because you're not a
savage and I like you.

456
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,572
- Woo!

457
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:55,783
- Are you leaving?

458
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,125
(whooping)

459
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,186
(laughing)

460
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:27,397
I am a child of fire and
you are a child of water.

461
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,859
How can I trust someone who
came from beneath the waves?

462
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,196
Maybe you've come here to
lure me into the water.

463
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:37,742
Or maybe you've come here
to cast a spell over me.

464
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:42,038
I think maybe you've been
sent here to bewitch my heart.

465
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:44,873
- Huh?

466
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,171
- Are you trying to find my heart?

467
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,842
You've got to catch me before
you can steal my heart.

468
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,596
(Malta laughing)

469
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,604
(yawning)

470
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,692
- So, little one.

471
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,736
No luck finding your friend?

472
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:15,904
- Who, Syrius?

473
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,031
He's no friend of mine anymore.

474
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:19,742
- Is that so?

475
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:29,085
- (laughs) You mean not everyone
under the waves can swim?

476
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,838
- Hermit crabs can't. (laughs)

477
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:36,466
They just crawl all around with
their houses on their backs.

478
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,093
- Oh, really?

479
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,929
You know so many interesting things.

480
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,682
- (laughs) I don't know half
as much as Aries Turtle.

481
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,308
- What's an Aries Turtle?

482
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,893
- He's an old sea turtle

483
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,020
and the wisest creature in the sea.

484
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,480
- Oh.

485
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,985
Oh, it sounds like a
wonderful place down there.

486
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,488
(Syrius gasps)

487
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,072
What is it?

488
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,073
Syrius?

489
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,576
- I must go.

490
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,411
- But why?

491
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:05,662
Why do you have to go so soon?

492
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,540
- Because it's almost dawn.

493
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,085
- But why do you have to leave at dawn?

494
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,503
- Because...

495
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,256
If the sun shines on a
Water Child, he dies.

496
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,966
- He dies?

497
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:21,303
That's what happens to us
if we fall into the water.

498
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,388
You must hurry up and go.

499
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:26,850
And so, I guess this is goodbye.

500
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,519
- Goodbye, I guess.

501
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,354
- I know.

502
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,189
We can...

503
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,689
We can meet here every night.

504
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,441
- Every night?

505
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,651
- I don't think you
want to be here with me.

506
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,528
You love someone else, I suppose.

507
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,905
- No, really, I don't.

508
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,532
- That's good, because I
want you all to myself.

509
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,533
- Huh?

510
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:47,037
- You're cute when you're confused.

511
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,496
Now then, it's all set.

512
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,583
We'll meet here every night at this time.

513
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:55,795
I wonder if this wise old sea
turtle of yours would know.

514
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:56,838
- [Syrius] What?

515
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:59,090
- If a Water Child and a Fire Child

516
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:01,885
can ever be close friends.

517
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,845
He won't know the answer.

518
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,890
I don't think anyone knows.

519
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:13,104
All I know is that I've never felt

520
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,732
anything like this before.

521
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,028
(yelling)

522
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,031
(gasps)

523
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,325
(sighs)

524
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,285
Goodbye, Syrius.

525
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,870
- Until tomorrow night.

526
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:31,289
- [Malta] Tomorrow night.

527
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,542
(whooping)

528
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,924
(subdued music)

529
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,355
- Malta?

530
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,565
Malta, where are you?

531
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,692
Ah.

532
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,236
(Piale giggling)

533
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,572
Come on and play with Piale!

534
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,241
Malta, what's wrong with you?

535
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,286
- Oh, I wish I could live
in this moment forever.

536
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,539
Haven't you ever wanted to
dive into the water, Piale?

537
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,334
Haven't you ever wanted to
meet a Water Child, Piale?

538
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,211
But no, of course not.

539
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:21,006
Because the Water People are
the enemies of the flame.

540
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,382
But why?

541
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,383
Why?

542
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,220
- Malta?

543
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,308
Piale loves Malta.

544
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,069
(snoring)

545
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,532
(yelling)

546
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,658
- Come on, wake up, Bibble.

547
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:49,784
Up and at 'em.

548
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:50,703
(laughing)

549
00:38:50,704 --> 00:38:52,537
- [Bibble] Where have you been?

550
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,247
- Woo-hoo!

551
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,624
(laughing)

552
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,626
Woo-hoo-hoo!

553
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,256
(laughing)

554
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,720
- Syrius!

555
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,931
(laughing)

556
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,686
(laughing)

557
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:21,317
(tense music)

558
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,282
(laughing)

559
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,713
- There you are, Malta.

560
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,092
You look particularly
lovely tonight, my child.

561
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,385
- Thank you, Mother.

562
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,512
I feel lovely tonight.

563
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,680
I'm as light as air.

564
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:55,600
I sometimes feel I could
almost walk on water.

565
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,102
- Don't talk like that, Malta.

566
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,896
You know I worry about you
guarding the flame all alone.

567
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,774
Now, why don't you stay here tonight?

568
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,359
- Stay here?

569
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,777
What do you mean?

570
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,863
- Let me send someone else
to guard the flame instead.

571
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,281
- No, you can't.

572
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:12,033
I must go, Mother.

573
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,411
It's my duty.

574
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:17,414
- Malta, after all, you will soon be queen

575
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,126
and then you need never
guard the Holy Flame again.

576
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,001
- No, Mother.

577
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:24,129
I insist that I go.

578
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,172
I must go.

579
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,217
Syrius will be waiting there for me.

580
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,892
- [Piale] Malta, I'll come with you.

581
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,602
- No, go back, Piale.
- No.

582
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,812
- Go back, I say.

583
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,399
Do you think I can't take care of myself?

584
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,654
- See if I care.

585
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,114
- Hey, wait up.

586
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,699
Syrius, wait for me.

587
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,742
Where ya goin'?

588
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,036
- Where I'm going, you can't come.

589
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,371
- What do you mean?

590
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,290
Of course, I can.

591
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,749
- I'm not gonna tell you again.

592
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,461
Go on, leave me alone.

593
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,088
- Well, go ahead!

594
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,673
Huh.

595
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,759
I hope he gets swallowed by a sea snake.

596
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,771
(water splashes)

597
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:33,948
- Syrius.

598
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,617
Shh.

599
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,287
(subdued music)

600
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:45,835
Over here.

601
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,004
This way.

602
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:53,010
- Huh?

603
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,192
Huh?

604
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,656
Malta?

605
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:15,657
Malta?

606
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,745
(barking)

607
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:23,706
(Malta laughing)

608
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,502
- Syrius, welcome to the Garden of Enon.

609
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:28,586
- Huh?

610
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:31,714
- (laughs) These are my loyal protectors.

611
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,716
Aren't they cute?

612
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,397
- [Syrius] Come here.

613
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,356
(Malta laughing)

614
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,190
Wait.

615
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:51,192
(both laughing)

616
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,610
- [Malta] You can't catch me.

617
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:53,611
- I'll catch you.

618
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,492
(both laughing)

619
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,162
(grunts)

620
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:05,874
Are you all right?

621
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,876
- [Malta] Stop!

622
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:09,712
- Oh, I, uh.

623
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:11,422
- You play too rough.

624
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,594
- [Syrius] Malta, I.

625
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,221
- Syrius.

626
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,055
- Huh?

627
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:20,889
- Here.

628
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,348
(Malta laughing)

629
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,017
- [Syrius] Stop, stop, wait a minute.

630
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,893
(both laughing)

631
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:28,063
(yawning)

632
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:50,710
- Syrius.

633
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,170
He wouldn't have gone back into

634
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,922
the Forbidden Zone, would he?

635
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,551
(rumbling)

636
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,145
(gasping)

637
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,277
(subdued music)

638
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,700
(tense music)

639
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,710
(electricity zapping)

640
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,924
- Jellyfish attack!

641
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:20,759
- Close up shop!

642
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:21,593
Let's go!

643
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:22,511
Let's go, come on!

644
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:24,680
(yelling)

645
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,275
- Geronimo!

646
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,905
(Bibble grunting)

647
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:47,494
(yelling)

648
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,622
Why you no good lily-livered.

649
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:52,707
- We can't just sit here.

650
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:53,875
We've got to do something.

651
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:54,710
- But what?

652
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,627
- Attack, I guess.

653
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:57,837
- [Both] Goodness gracious.

654
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,507
(subdued music)

655
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:13,895
(water splashing)

656
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,398
(tense music)

657
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:21,487
- [Syrius] Uh oh, there's trouble.

658
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:23,654
- [Malta] Don't go.

659
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:24,615
- I have to.

660
00:46:24,616 --> 00:46:26,783
But don't worry, I'll be back.

661
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,912
- Syrius!

662
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,587
(groaning)

663
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:43,967
- Prince Syrius!

664
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:46,719
- What happened?

665
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,054
- [Seahorse] The jellyfish.

666
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,431
We couldn't stop them.

667
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,601
- Bibble, are you hurt?

668
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:56,187
- Why don't you go back
to the Forbidden Zone?

669
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,188
- [Syrius] Bibble.

670
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,858
- And that pretty Fire Child of yours.

671
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:01,693
- What's this?

672
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:02,985
A Fire Child?

673
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,445
- What are you saying?

674
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:05,322
- That's right.

675
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,156
I was there.

676
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:08,282
I saw the whole thing.

677
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:09,909
Leave me alone, you traitor.

678
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:10,869
- Bibble!

679
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,204
- [Seahorse] Prince Syrius,
this is most distressing.

680
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,039
- [Seahorse] You met a Fire Child?

681
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,083
- [Seahorse] You entered
the Forbidden Zone?

682
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,543
- [Seahorse] That's impossible.

683
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,086
It's, it's.

684
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,462
- [Both] Forbidden.

685
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:23,215
- Is it true, Prince Syrius?

686
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,175
Prince Syrius!

687
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:26,676
- This is most disturbing news.

688
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,846
- Most disturbing, indeed.

689
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,772
- Syrius.

690
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,566
Where are you off to?

691
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,567
Come here.

692
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:47,238
Why are you floating about
at this ungodly hour?

693
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,489
- Tell me, Aries Turtle.

694
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:52,493
What exactly is so evil
about the Fire People?

695
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:54,036
- The Fire People?

696
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:54,872
- Mm-hmm.

697
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:58,124
I know one of them who is
very kind and very pretty.

698
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,417
- You...

699
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:01,544
You met a Fire Child?

700
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,504
Oh, my prince, this is terrible.

701
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:05,966
It must never happen
again, do you hear me?

702
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,467
- Why is it terrible?

703
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:10,094
What's wrong with the Fire People?

704
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,847
What's wrong with my loving Malta?

705
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:16,058
- My prince, there
happens to be a law here

706
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:19,520
in this Kingdom of the Sea
which states that none of us

707
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:23,065
can ever come in contact
with a child of fire.

708
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,901
- Who decided on such a law?

709
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,360
I don't care!

710
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:28,571
I don't care, I love Malta.

711
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,448
- Be a man!

712
00:48:29,449 --> 00:48:31,449
You're now the king of the Water People.

713
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,201
It's time you realized that

714
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:37,205
and started behaving like a king.

715
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,919
- Maybe you're right, but I love Malta.

716
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:45,087
Can love be wrong?

717
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:48,550
Do I have to choose between
loving someone and being king?

718
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,551
- Hmm.

719
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:52,011
Well, Syrius.

720
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:56,933
Now you know that being king
isn't all a bowl of caviar.

721
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,435
It comes with responsibilities.

722
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:00,646
- What'll I do?

723
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:02,772
Hmm?

724
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:03,773
No.

725
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,403
- Take care, Syrius.

726
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,365
I worry about that boy.

727
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,003
- Oh, Syrius, where are you?

728
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:27,589
Where are you?

729
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,801
- Well, I think someone
should tell King Oceanus

730
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,719
that Syrius is acting very strangely.

731
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,513
- Very strangely, indeed.

732
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,348
- Shh.

733
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:37,515
I don't trust him when
he's behaving like this.

734
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:38,516
Come along.

735
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:40,893
Come along.

736
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,941
- [Syrius] Malta, Malta.

737
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:48,567
- Aha!

738
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:50,069
There you are, Syrius.

739
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,947
Listen, Syrius, you just
weren't cut out to be king.

740
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,658
I can understand, it's a lot of hard work.

741
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,411
But take a look at me, Mugwug the Great!

742
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,329
Mugwug the Magnificent!

743
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,373
Mugwug the King!

744
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:05,334
I'd make a terrific king, really I would.

745
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,378
So what do you say?

746
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,088
Give me the Eye of Algorac!

747
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,464
I wanna be king!

748
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:12,634
(yelling)

749
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:16,178
What a king I'd make!

750
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,179
What do you say?

751
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,932
- Take a look.

752
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:20,933
- Huh?

753
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:24,312
- Oh well.

754
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,524
(laughing)

755
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:31,819
- I guess that means his answer is no.

756
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,113
But I'll be the king yet.

757
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,865
(laughs)

758
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,535
(subdued music)

759
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,466
- Malta, what's wrong?

760
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,551
You're acting very strangely.

761
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,845
Is it because of the great solar eclipse

762
00:50:57,846 --> 00:50:59,973
that is coming in only a few days now?

763
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:03,810
- The great eclipse?

764
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:06,937
- Yes.

765
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,856
When a brave new sun will be born

766
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:11,692
out of the blackest moment of darkness.

767
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:15,654
And you will inherit my crown
as Queen of the Fire People.

768
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,698
- (gasps) What?

769
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:20,159
No, no, it's too soon!

770
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,744
Please, Mother, not yet.

771
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,330
I want to stay as I am
for a little while longer.

772
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,457
Let me guard the flame.

773
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,751
- What has gotten into you, Malta?

774
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,920
You're behaving like a silly little girl

775
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,506
and not like a queen at all.

776
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,633
And now, children of the fire,

777
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,927
go with Malta to guard the flame tonight

778
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,096
and dance with your future mistress.

779
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,430
- No, Mother, no.

780
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:44,266
Please, let me guard the Holy Flame alone.

781
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,645
I won't have many more chances to do it.

782
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,022
I'd rather be alone.

783
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:59,865
(barking)

784
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:02,494
I will soon be leaving
you, my loyal friends.

785
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:08,041
They tell me I am to be
Queen of the Fire People.

786
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,878
Then, my days in this
garden will be through.

787
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:16,216
So, let's have a mighty flame tonight.

788
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:26,058
- [Syrius] Malta!

789
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,059
Malta!

790
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:30,480
- Ah, Syrius.

791
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:32,940
- Yahoo!

792
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,235
- Syrius.

793
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,322
It's so good to see you.

794
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,199
I was waiting for you.

795
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,452
I thought maybe you wouldn't come back.

796
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,246
- Don't be silly, Malta.

797
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,081
I'll always be here.

798
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:51,125
All those laws about children of fire

799
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:54,253
and children of water have
nothing to do with us, you know.

800
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,297
Nothing on earth will keep me from you.

801
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:58,382
You'll see.

802
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:01,052
- Oh, Syrius, I hope so.

803
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,351
- A Water Child!

804
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:15,567
- Piale, stop!

805
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:23,199
(Malta yells)

806
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,034
Syrius!

807
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:25,993
(water splashes)

808
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:28,787
Piale, what are you doing?

809
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:31,248
- Piale doesn't love Malta anymore!

810
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,250
I never did!

811
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:35,920
You'll pay for this!

812
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:36,921
- Piale!

813
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:43,427
Piale.

814
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:46,431
(sobbing)

815
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,694
- Malta, I love you, Malta.

816
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,657
(crying)

817
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:17,836
- Syrius.

818
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:19,546
- Huh?

819
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:24,093
- I'll never forget you, never.

820
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,094
- What?

821
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:27,054
Malta.

822
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:31,976
- Syrius, this is the last
time you will ever see me.

823
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:34,728
We shall never be able to meet again.

824
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:36,313
It is over.

825
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:37,314
Over.

826
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,566
- Over?

827
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:42,237
(subdued music)

828
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:58,419
- Oh.

829
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,428
No, it's not over!

830
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:10,180
No!

831
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:11,640
No!

832
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:12,641
- Syrius.

833
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:16,604
- Wait, Malta!

834
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,275
(water splashes)

835
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:22,360
Malta, Malta.

836
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,361
Malta.
- Syrius.

837
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:25,362
- Malta!

838
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,241
- Take me with you, Syrius!

839
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:32,411
(yelling)

840
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:35,165
(water splashes)

841
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,126
- Aries Turtle, it's you.

842
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:45,091
- So, you wouldn't listen to me, eh?

843
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:56,852
- Don't be afraid.

844
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,104
It's only my old friend Aries Turtle.

845
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:02,649
- So this is the Fire Child Malta.

846
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:05,235
She certainly is an exceptional beauty.

847
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:08,155
It's understandable you
lost your head over her.

848
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:10,115
- That's right, I love Malta.

849
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,283
And why is that wrong?

850
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:12,743
I want you to tell me.

851
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:15,579
- Calm down, my prince.

852
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:20,417
I think it's about time I
told you why a child of water

853
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:23,962
and a child of fire cannot be together.

854
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:26,090
- No, we don't want to hear about it.

855
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,800
- Listen to what I have to say.

856
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:31,595
Your father, Oceanus, and
Malta's mother, Hyperia,

857
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:33,389
are actually brother and sister.

858
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,556
- What?
- What?

859
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:37,518
- Look over there, in that reflection.

860
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:41,773
In the beginning, both fire
and water were in one body.

861
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,108
- One body?

862
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,196
- It was very long ago.

863
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:53,867
Long before this flame
or this sea were here,

864
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:55,994
your parents lived as one.

865
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:59,915
Fire and water, side by side,

866
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:03,336
wrapped in a warm cloud of steam.

867
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:09,508
But Algorac, the Dark Lord of the Winds,

868
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:12,302
grew jealous of their happiness.

869
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:15,722
And so he spread evil rumors,

870
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:20,061
sewing distrust and hatred
between brother and sister.

871
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:25,607
Algorac told Oceanus that his sister

872
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:28,610
considered him a coward and a fool.

873
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,612
And that Hyperia felt her flames

874
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,115
would glow brighter without him.

875
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:37,035
Then, he turned to Hyperia
and told her that her brother

876
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:40,330
was planning to douse her flames forever

877
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:44,335
so that the sea would
reign supreme on the earth.

878
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:49,131
Both brother and sister
believed Algorac's lies.

879
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,632
And as their love for each other

880
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,759
had been so strong and pure,

881
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,470
their bitterness at being betrayed

882
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:57,139
soon grew into a deadly wrath.

883
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,475
The Goddess of Fire was inflamed with hate

884
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,894
and she rose up into the heavens.

885
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:04,980
And the Lord of the Water shook with fury,

886
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,734
and the earth was covered
with a terrible storm.

887
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:11,945
The war between brother and
sister became a war between

888
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:15,199
son and son, daughter and daughter.

889
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,242
Until the families of fire and water

890
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:19,704
slaughtered each other into near oblivion.

891
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:23,332
Then, he who rules over the universe,

892
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:27,212
the greatest lord of all,
struck the evil Algorac down

893
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:34,677
and he took Algorac's eye,
the source of all his powers.

894
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:38,555
And he imprisoned the
Dark Lord of the Winds

895
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:40,974
far beneath the mighty waves,

896
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:44,020
in the lowest depths
of the Forbidden Zone.

897
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:50,401
And here Algorac lies, quiet
and harmless to this very day.

898
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:54,154
And to prevent this terrible
war from starting afresh,

899
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:55,323
a law was made.

900
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:58,909
A law forbidding the children of fire

901
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:02,371
and the children of water
from ever showing themselves

902
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,499
to each other, you see?

903
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,878
Listen, Syrius.

904
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:12,966
In the beginning, fire
and water were as one.

905
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,927
But now they are things which must be kept

906
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,555
forever very far apart.

907
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,266
Avoid hatred by avoiding each other.

908
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:25,143
That is the law we must obey.

909
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:26,144
Huh?

910
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:30,816
Huh?

911
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:56,633
The power of love shouldn't
be underestimated.

912
00:59:56,634 --> 01:00:01,597
And under its spell, laws and
rules lose their significance.

913
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:06,101
Syrius, I'm not sure, but
there may be a way out of this.

914
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,603
- [Both] Huh?

915
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,771
- They say that somewhere in the heavens

916
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:13,108
there's a star where fire
and water live together.

917
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:14,318
- [Both] A star?

918
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:17,988
- Yes, they say it's
a very beautiful star.

919
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,448
- Aries Turtle, tell us.

920
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,783
How do we get to that star?

921
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:25,037
- You see, there is a
very strange phenomenon

922
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:29,875
that happens once every 90
years when the sun hides itself

923
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:32,753
and the earth is covered with darkness.

924
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:34,921
- The sun hides itself?

925
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:36,798
- Just so.

926
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,427
No one knows why it happens, exactly.

927
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,888
But the fiery chariot
of the sun is smothered

928
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,806
and the earth is as black as night.

929
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:48,143
Let me see, I can never
remember what it's called.

930
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,269
The eclipse.

931
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:50,729
Yes, that's it.

932
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:54,691
The day when the black
sun appears overhead.

933
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:56,318
- The black sun?

934
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,153
- Yes.

935
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,987
And when this black sun comes,

936
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:02,032
flaming red rings start to burn around it.

937
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:06,203
And a mysterious flower
blooms on the Hills of Elysium

938
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:10,540
between the Kingdom of Fire
and the Kingdom of Water.

939
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:13,043
Kalea, these strange flowers are called.

940
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:16,463
And it is said that their
blossoms only last for a moment

941
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:18,924
before they burst and fly heavenwards

942
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:21,009
toward that beautiful star.

943
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,761
- The Hill of Elysium.

944
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,305
- And the Kalea flowers.

945
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,058
- Now, if you were to go
up to the Hill of Elysium

946
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:30,394
on the day the black sun appears,

947
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:34,064
and find the Kalea
flowers, when they burst,

948
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:36,776
they might carry you up
into the sky with them.

949
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:41,446
Up to that star where fire
and water can live together.

950
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:43,324
- Oh, can it be possible?

951
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:47,202
Syrius, that's our star.

952
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:48,079
- Now, let's see.

953
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:51,416
Tonight there's a new moon overhead.

954
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:56,086
Oh, the eclipse that comes
only once every 90 years

955
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:58,755
is due five days from today.

956
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:00,132
- Is that right, Aries Turtle?

957
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,550
Only five more days?

958
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:02,718
Did you hear that, Malta?

959
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,763
Only five more days and we'll
be free to fly to that star.

960
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:09,975
(water splashes)
(laughing)

961
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,893
- I never would have believed it.

962
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:12,894
- Mugwug.

963
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,772
- Consorting with the enemy, are you?

964
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:17,733
I've caught you red-handed.

965
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,986
Now we see where you've
been going every night.

966
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,488
Oh, she's a pretty little fire savage,

967
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:25,157
isn't she, Prince Syrius?

968
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:28,285
And you, you toothless old fool.

969
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:29,245
You should have known better

970
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:30,954
than to enter the Forbidden Zone.

971
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:32,831
I wonder what King Oceanus will think

972
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,374
when he hears about this.

973
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:35,625
We'll see.

974
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:38,128
(laughing)

975
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:40,130
- Mugwug, stop!

976
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:41,381
It's not what you think!

977
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:42,216
Stop!

978
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:43,217
- Aries Turtle, wait!

979
01:02:43,218 --> 01:02:45,135
Where is the Hill of Elysium?

980
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:46,345
Aries Turtle!

981
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:52,809
- [Malta] Do you think there
really is such a place?

982
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:55,020
- [Syrius] I've never known
Aries Turtle to be wrong.

983
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:57,230
Come on, we'll find it
ourselves if we have to.

984
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:58,440
- [Malta] Oh yes, Syrius.

985
01:02:58,441 --> 01:02:59,901
I'll do anything you say.

986
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:04,614
(subdued music)

987
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:10,494
- (gasps) Malta, the flame!

988
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:11,412
It's going out!

989
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:12,412
- Huh?

990
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,723
What have I done?

991
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:33,850
- Malta.

992
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:35,436
- What have I done?

993
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:37,938
- Malta, it's all right.
- No, no!

994
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:39,022
I let it die.

995
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:41,817
I let the Holy Flame die.

996
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:44,110
- We'll both run away, Malta.

997
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:45,570
We'll go to the Hill of Elysium

998
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:47,989
and find those flowers
Aries Turtle talked about.

999
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,032
Then we'll go to the star

1000
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:51,201
where we can live together forever, Malta.

1001
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:54,830
- No, no, it's over.

1002
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,790
It's finished now.

1003
01:03:56,791 --> 01:04:00,252
My mother will find out that
the Holy Flame has died.

1004
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:02,379
Any moment they will come to capture me

1005
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,090
and they will kill you, Syrius.

1006
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:06,175
- Stop it, Malta.

1007
01:04:08,302 --> 01:04:10,011
- Malta, you must go.

1008
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:11,012
You must run away with him

1009
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:12,764
and find the flowers that will save you.

1010
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:14,642
I will stay here and stop the others.

1011
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,477
- No, no.
- Malta, come on.

1012
01:04:17,478 --> 01:04:18,728
- Piale.

1013
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:20,939
- Hurry up and go before it's too late.

1014
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:21,774
Run!

1015
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:22,858
Go on!

1016
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:23,859
- Piale.

1017
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:28,488
Bless you, Piale!

1018
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:33,494
When we find the Hill of
Elysium, we'll come back for you!

1019
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,205
(subdued music)

1020
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:53,180
- [Piale] Piale loves Malta.

1021
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:55,975
I will save you, Malta.

1022
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:59,561
I will become the Holy Flame myself,

1023
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,689
and no one will ever know it went out.

1024
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:38,059
- The Holy Flame looks unusually
beautiful tonight, Majesty.

1025
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:42,062
- Beautiful, indeed.

1026
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:44,564
- Why, it looks sadder and lonelier

1027
01:05:44,565 --> 01:05:46,275
than I've ever seen it before.

1028
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:50,821
(tone pulsing)

1029
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:19,183
- Piale, what have you done?

1030
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:21,851
Go!

1031
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:24,188
Find Malta and bring her back to me!

1032
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:29,609
(yells)

1033
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:30,778
- Are you all right?

1034
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:32,989
They found us.

1035
01:06:40,621 --> 01:06:43,374
(lasers zapping)

1036
01:06:48,462 --> 01:06:49,462
Come on.

1037
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:54,385
- [Malta] I hope Piale is safe.

1038
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,688
(grunting)

1039
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:09,649
- [Syrius] Malta!

1040
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:10,650
Malta!

1041
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:15,573
(grunting)

1042
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:31,630
(rumbling)

1043
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,020
Oceanus.

1044
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,318
- Oceanus!

1045
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,695
So, it was you who stole
my daughter from me

1046
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:57,405
and killed the Holy Flame!

1047
01:07:57,406 --> 01:07:59,450
- [Oceanus] I have nothing to say to you.

1048
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:12,212
Syrius, tell me.

1049
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:14,631
What is the meaning of this?

1050
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:16,841
- Great King Oceanus, forgive me.

1051
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:18,802
But you must let us go
to the Hill of Elysium.

1052
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:22,013
- [Oceanus] You, the one
I placed all my faith in?

1053
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:23,890
I made you King of the Sea.

1054
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:26,434
Is this how you repay me?

1055
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:28,520
- (laughs) You see, Your majesty?

1056
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:30,688
I told you, I told you.

1057
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:33,483
- But I love this child of fire!

1058
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:34,484
King Oceanus!

1059
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:38,280
- [Oceanus] Return to the sea at once!

1060
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:42,367
- [Malta] Syrius!

1061
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:43,368
- Malta!

1062
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:46,497
Are you a daughter of mine?

1063
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,124
Get away from the water!

1064
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,625
- [Malta] No, I won't!

1065
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:53,419
I can't leave him, I can't!

1066
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:55,673
(laughing)

1067
01:08:58,175 --> 01:09:00,177
- Mugwug, let go of her!

1068
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:02,720
- Syrius!

1069
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,142
- Malta!

1070
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:09,102
Malta!

1071
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:11,772
(Mugwug laughs)

1072
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:45,805
♪ Malta the Bad, Malta the Wild ♪

1073
01:09:45,806 --> 01:09:48,308
♪ Malta ran off with a Water Child ♪

1074
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:50,727
♪ Malta the Bad, Malta the Wild ♪

1075
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:54,480
- Malta, my child, you were
bewitched by that Water Child.

1076
01:09:54,481 --> 01:09:56,775
I told you that they are
enemies of the flame.

1077
01:09:59,236 --> 01:10:02,655
- Piale is dead and
it's your fault, Malta!

1078
01:10:02,656 --> 01:10:05,534
You would have betrayed us!

1079
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:10,079
- No, I loved him.

1080
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,080
I loved him.

1081
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:14,375
(sobbing)

1082
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:18,255
- Malta, your weeping
will be over very soon.

1083
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:23,801
In a few days, the
great eclipse will occur

1084
01:10:23,802 --> 01:10:25,221
and the black sun will come.

1085
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:28,765
- The eclipse?

1086
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:32,060
The black sun will come?

1087
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:33,186
- Yes.

1088
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:36,189
And when it passes, you will be queen.

1089
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:40,109
- Mother, I must go to
the Hill of Elysium.

1090
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:42,947
Syrius will come to meet me there.

1091
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:52,039
(Malta yelling)

1092
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:11,099
- Malta, my child, forgive me,

1093
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:14,228
but you will never set eyes
on the Water Child again.

1094
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:18,941
(water bubbling)

1095
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:34,497
- Oceanus, why have you
locked me away in this place?

1096
01:11:34,498 --> 01:11:36,416
Tell me, great Oceanus!

1097
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:40,129
Why is it so wrong to
love a child of fire?

1098
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:44,341
(grunting)

1099
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:49,013
- (laughs) What have we here?

1100
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:52,265
On your right, my friends,

1101
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:55,143
you see a wild Water Child in a cage.

1102
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,853
A thrilling sight, isn't it?

1103
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:59,355
(laughs)

1104
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:00,565
- [Syrius] You'll pay for this!

1105
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:02,775
- Don't get too close
to the cage, my friends.

1106
01:12:02,776 --> 01:12:05,653
The animal is very ferocious.

1107
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:07,906
(laughing)

1108
01:12:08,782 --> 01:12:10,658
You should've given me the Eye of Algorac

1109
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:12,201
when you had the chance, my boy.

1110
01:12:12,202 --> 01:12:16,205
Then, you wouldn't be in this
mess and I would be king.

1111
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:17,832
As I will be anyway.

1112
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:20,085
(laughing)

1113
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:26,759
(grunting)

1114
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:45,861
(panting)

1115
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:50,199
(playful music)

1116
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,207
- Oh, Mother, please let me out.

1117
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,208
Please.

1118
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:47,631
My little friends, thank you.

1119
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:12,823
(tones pulsing)

1120
01:14:27,337 --> 01:14:28,337
- Syrius.

1121
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:32,091
You okay, Syrius?

1122
01:14:32,092 --> 01:14:33,426
- Huh?

1123
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:35,052
Oh, Bibble.

1124
01:14:35,053 --> 01:14:36,554
Any news from the outside world?

1125
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:38,931
- Uh-uh, not yet.

1126
01:14:38,932 --> 01:14:40,141
- And Malta.

1127
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:42,852
Have you heard anything about
what they've done to her?

1128
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:44,646
- Is she really something special?

1129
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:48,774
- She's the most special
something in the whole world.

1130
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:49,775
- Ah.

1131
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:54,280
- I'll never see her again.

1132
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:56,282
- Now don't start talking like that.

1133
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:57,117
I've got it!

1134
01:14:57,117 --> 01:14:58,035
I'll get you out.

1135
01:14:58,035 --> 01:14:58,994
I will, Syrius.

1136
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:00,745
Don't you worry.

1137
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:02,998
(grunting)

1138
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:08,212
(saw scraping)

1139
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:14,426
(grunting)

1140
01:15:24,269 --> 01:15:25,269
Now what?

1141
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:29,733
(tense music)

1142
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:40,244
- Syrius, where is the Hill of Elysium?

1143
01:15:47,292 --> 01:15:48,876
- [Voice] Oh, what have we here?

1144
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:50,127
It's a birdie.

1145
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:51,712
- No, it's not a birdie.

1146
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:53,256
Use your head.

1147
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:54,091
- I agree.

1148
01:15:54,092 --> 01:15:55,299
I think she's a birdie.

1149
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,218
- Let's eat her.

1150
01:15:56,219 --> 01:15:58,010
- If we eat her, we
won't be able to find out

1151
01:15:58,011 --> 01:15:59,720
if she's a bird or not, will we?

1152
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:03,140
- Good thinking.
- Let's eat her.

1153
01:16:03,141 --> 01:16:05,393
- [Malta] Please, can you help me?

1154
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,228
Where is the Hill of Elysium?

1155
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:08,063
- Elysium?

1156
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,897
- It's in the North.

1157
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:10,606
- It's in the South.

1158
01:16:10,607 --> 01:16:11,567
- It's over here.

1159
01:16:11,568 --> 01:16:13,067
- It doesn't exist.

1160
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:15,445
(chattering)

1161
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:19,240
- [Malta] Please, help me.

1162
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:22,118
Doesn't one of you know
where the Hill of Elysium is?

1163
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:26,999
- If we tell you where Elysium
is, will you let us eat you?

1164
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:29,835
- Syrius, where are you?

1165
01:16:32,879 --> 01:16:34,964
(yells)

1166
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:38,134
- Won't you be a good
birdie and let us eat you?

1167
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:39,636
- Help me, Syrius!

1168
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:42,014
- Huh, Syrius?

1169
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:46,101
(chattering)

1170
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:13,044
- Malta!

1171
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:15,714
(subdued music)

1172
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:19,133
Malta!

1173
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:24,430
Malta!

1174
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:36,484
Malta!

1175
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:40,154
Malta!

1176
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:45,785
Malta!

1177
01:17:49,289 --> 01:17:51,166
Why won't they let me see you?

1178
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:54,460
Malta!

1179
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:05,096
Malta.

1180
01:18:08,558 --> 01:18:10,893
- Hey, I've thought of a way

1181
01:18:10,894 --> 01:18:12,896
you can break Syrius out of there.

1182
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,942
- (gasps) Wake up Algorac?

1183
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:19,193
- Shh.

1184
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:21,696
You steal the eyeball he
wears around his neck,

1185
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:24,281
find Algorac, and stick
it back in his head.

1186
01:18:24,282 --> 01:18:27,201
Algorac wakes up and goes
crazy, smashes up this place,

1187
01:18:27,202 --> 01:18:29,829
and Syrius escapes.

1188
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:32,081
- Algorac will smash up a
lot more than this place

1189
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:33,166
if he's woken up.

1190
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:37,002
- Well, if you ask me, you
don't have much choice.

1191
01:18:37,003 --> 01:18:39,797
You want your buddy Syrius free or not?

1192
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:42,091
- All right, I'll do it!

1193
01:18:42,092 --> 01:18:43,884
(laughing)

1194
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:45,428
- Come here, come here.

1195
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:46,429
He fell for it.

1196
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:47,847
You know what to do?

1197
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:49,932
- [All] You can count on us.

1198
01:18:49,933 --> 01:18:50,809
- What?

1199
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:52,977
The Eye of Algorac?

1200
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:53,812
- Yeah.

1201
01:18:53,813 --> 01:18:55,563
All I have to do is
stick it back in his head

1202
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:57,022
while he's sleeping.

1203
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,734
Come on, I'm not afraid.

1204
01:19:00,026 --> 01:19:01,944
- But you can't do that.

1205
01:19:01,945 --> 01:19:05,030
- Hey listen, you've gotta
find your Fire Child, right?

1206
01:19:05,031 --> 01:19:07,784
How are you ever gonna do that
stuck in a place like this?

1207
01:19:10,328 --> 01:19:11,370
Oh, so that's it.

1208
01:19:11,371 --> 01:19:13,706
That dumb old eyeball is
all that matters to you.

1209
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:15,708
All you care about is being king.

1210
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:17,960
- No, that's not it at all.

1211
01:19:17,961 --> 01:19:19,086
I broke the law.

1212
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:20,796
I don't deserve to be king.

1213
01:19:20,797 --> 01:19:23,674
Take the eye, Bibble, and
give it back to Great Oceanus.

1214
01:19:23,675 --> 01:19:25,426
Tell him I'm not worthy of it.

1215
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:27,762
Then, maybe he'll let me go from here.

1216
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:28,597
Take it.

1217
01:19:28,598 --> 01:19:30,015
Take it, please.

1218
01:19:33,059 --> 01:19:34,102
- All right.

1219
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:38,147
If you're sure you really
want me to, I will.

1220
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:40,274
- Take it straight to Oceanus, you hear?

1221
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:41,609
- Don't worry, I will.

1222
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:44,946
And I'll make him promise to let you go.

1223
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:53,704
Hey, Let me go!

1224
01:19:53,705 --> 01:19:54,705
Hey!

1225
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:57,750
(laughs)

1226
01:19:57,751 --> 01:19:58,751
- It's mine!

1227
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:01,922
It's all mine!

1228
01:20:06,551 --> 01:20:08,594
- [Fish] Now you're the king, master.

1229
01:20:08,595 --> 01:20:10,763
- [Fish] You'll make a great king, master.

1230
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:14,058
- It's enough to make me wanna cry.

1231
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:15,894
- [All] Three cheers for our master!

1232
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:19,605
- You'll have to call me king from now on,

1233
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:21,982
you parasitic pollywogs!

1234
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:22,818
- [All] Hooray!

1235
01:20:22,819 --> 01:20:26,070
Three cheers for our master, the king!

1236
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:29,573
- [Mugwug] And now, lets have a party!

1237
01:20:29,574 --> 01:20:31,827
(cheering)

1238
01:20:33,745 --> 01:20:35,871
- [Fish] A toast to King Master Mugwug.

1239
01:20:35,872 --> 01:20:37,999
- And all of you will be my ministers.

1240
01:20:38,959 --> 01:20:41,211
(cheering)

1241
01:20:42,587 --> 01:20:44,798
Dance, dance!

1242
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,553
(laughing)

1243
01:20:50,554 --> 01:20:52,555
More wine!

1244
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:54,307
More wine, more wine!

1245
01:20:55,475 --> 01:20:57,602
- [Fish] Yeah, here we go.

1246
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:04,483
- Drink up.

1247
01:21:04,484 --> 01:21:06,944
(laughs) Drink up.

1248
01:21:06,945 --> 01:21:09,155
(laughing)

1249
01:21:13,076 --> 01:21:15,245
(humming)

1250
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:21,959
A vision of beauty.

1251
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,837
May I have this dance?

1252
01:21:37,183 --> 01:21:38,183
Huh?

1253
01:21:42,647 --> 01:21:44,774
Where do you think you're going, huh?

1254
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:49,069
(laughs)

1255
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:50,070
Why you!

1256
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:53,741
- [Bibble] Wee!

1257
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:54,659
Bombs away!

1258
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:55,827
- Stand Still!

1259
01:21:57,370 --> 01:22:00,040
Give me back my eyeball!

1260
01:22:08,673 --> 01:22:09,883
- Some king you'd make.

1261
01:22:12,677 --> 01:22:13,886
- Huh?

1262
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:15,763
- [Creature] Not so fast!

1263
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:16,889
Come back here!

1264
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:17,807
- I don't wanna talk about it.

1265
01:22:17,808 --> 01:22:19,600
- Oh, you never wanna talk about anything.

1266
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:20,685
- [Both] Huh?

1267
01:22:24,731 --> 01:22:26,023
- Stop!

1268
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:27,691
Where do you think you're going?

1269
01:22:27,692 --> 01:22:29,944
Don't you know this is the bed chamber

1270
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:32,071
of Great King Oceanus himself?

1271
01:22:32,072 --> 01:22:32,989
- [Bibble] Sure I do.

1272
01:22:32,989 --> 01:22:33,823
Wake him up.

1273
01:22:33,824 --> 01:22:34,907
He's gotta see me.

1274
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:36,700
- He's got to see you?

1275
01:22:36,701 --> 01:22:38,410
- Wake him up?

1276
01:22:38,411 --> 01:22:40,664
(laughing)

1277
01:22:42,832 --> 01:22:43,958
- What's so funny?

1278
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:47,252
Syrius told me to come here and
give him the Eye of Algorac.

1279
01:22:47,253 --> 01:22:48,171
- [Guard] What's that?

1280
01:22:48,172 --> 01:22:49,588
- [Guard] The Eye of Algorac?

1281
01:22:49,589 --> 01:22:51,256
- Yeah, here, I'll show you.

1282
01:22:51,257 --> 01:22:52,299
Oops.

1283
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,134
Wait.

1284
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:54,719
Where'd I put that thing?

1285
01:22:55,887 --> 01:22:58,305
- This one's gonna be trouble.

1286
01:22:58,306 --> 01:22:59,598
- Ah, here it is.

1287
01:22:59,599 --> 01:23:00,599
I told you.

1288
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:03,268
- How could a puny
little pollywog like you

1289
01:23:03,269 --> 01:23:06,981
be carrying around the Eye of Algorac?

1290
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:09,483
- Be careful, don't lose it.

1291
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:11,568
- Now, beat it before we get mad!

1292
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:13,738
(yelling)

1293
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:22,037
- Ow!

1294
01:23:22,038 --> 01:23:23,205
All right, be that way.

1295
01:23:23,206 --> 01:23:26,042
If you won't listen to me,
I'll show you what I can do.

1296
01:23:27,961 --> 01:23:28,795
I'll show them.

1297
01:23:28,796 --> 01:23:29,837
When Algorac wakes up,

1298
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:32,131
they'll be sorry they didn't listen to me.

1299
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:33,298
- Ah, my little pearl.

1300
01:23:33,299 --> 01:23:34,299
Huh?

1301
01:23:35,719 --> 01:23:38,138
- I've got you now!
- Gangway!

1302
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:43,392
- Hey, there he goes again.

1303
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:46,478
- Huh?
- There he goes again.

1304
01:23:46,479 --> 01:23:47,730
Let's follow him.

1305
01:23:47,731 --> 01:23:48,731
Let's go.

1306
01:23:52,235 --> 01:23:54,404
(panting)

1307
01:23:59,909 --> 01:24:02,119
(gulps)

1308
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,121
- Maybe I shouldn't be here.

1309
01:24:04,122 --> 01:24:04,998
What do I do now?

1310
01:24:04,999 --> 01:24:06,374
I can't just go back.

1311
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:09,544
(rumbling)

1312
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:14,966
I'd better go back and
ask Syrius what to do.

1313
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:23,223
- [Both] Oh, look at that!

1314
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:26,351
- What is it?
- I don't know.

1315
01:24:26,352 --> 01:24:28,605
(grunting)

1316
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:31,733
(yelling)

1317
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:41,366
- [Both] Let's get outta here!

1318
01:24:41,367 --> 01:24:43,786
(grunting)

1319
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:46,039
(rumbling)

1320
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:16,945
(yelling)

1321
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:27,247
(yelling)

1322
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:31,333
- Oh, no!

1323
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:34,169
Algorac must be awake.

1324
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:35,505
Bibble, what have you done?

1325
01:25:40,051 --> 01:25:41,051
No!

1326
01:25:53,273 --> 01:25:56,025
(waves crashing)

1327
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:46,868
(screeching)

1328
01:26:51,122 --> 01:26:53,625
(tone pulses)

1329
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,060
- Syrius.

1330
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,922
(rumbling)

1331
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:50,390
(tone ringing)

1332
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:56,604
(rumbling)

1333
01:28:41,357 --> 01:28:44,027
(tone warbling)

1334
01:28:55,872 --> 01:28:57,915
(grunts)

1335
01:29:11,137 --> 01:29:12,137
- Bibble!

1336
01:29:12,889 --> 01:29:13,889
Bibble!

1337
01:29:20,938 --> 01:29:21,938
Huh?

1338
01:29:24,942 --> 01:29:25,942
Bibble!

1339
01:29:30,281 --> 01:29:31,656
Bibble.

1340
01:29:31,657 --> 01:29:34,327
(subdued music)

1341
01:29:35,828 --> 01:29:37,997
Bibble, are you all right?

1342
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:44,753
- Syrius, you did get
out of prison after all.

1343
01:29:44,754 --> 01:29:48,715
- Yes, here I am, and I couldn't
have done it without you.

1344
01:29:48,716 --> 01:29:51,760
- I'm sorry I didn't
keep my promise to you.

1345
01:29:51,761 --> 01:29:55,306
I wasn't able to get the Eye
of Algorac to King Oceanus.

1346
01:29:57,433 --> 01:29:59,142
- That's all right, Bibble.

1347
01:29:59,143 --> 01:30:00,352
Don't worry about it.

1348
01:30:00,353 --> 01:30:02,313
I'm sure Oceanus will understand.

1349
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:06,984
Now, let's take care of you.

1350
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:10,612
- No, Syrius.

1351
01:30:10,613 --> 01:30:11,822
Forget about me.

1352
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:14,449
You've got lots of things to do, remember?

1353
01:30:14,450 --> 01:30:15,534
It's no use.

1354
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:17,202
- What do you mean forget about you?

1355
01:30:17,203 --> 01:30:18,870
What do you mean it's no use?

1356
01:30:18,871 --> 01:30:19,705
Bibble, stop it.

1357
01:30:19,706 --> 01:30:21,456
You can't talk like that.

1358
01:30:21,457 --> 01:30:24,751
- You have to find your Fire
Child, and the Hill of Elysium,

1359
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:27,212
and the flowers that will take you away.

1360
01:30:27,213 --> 01:30:29,798
- We'll wait 'till you're
better, then you can go, too.

1361
01:30:29,799 --> 01:30:31,258
We'll take you with us.

1362
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:32,926
- Syrius?
- What is it?

1363
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:34,594
- Promise me one thing.

1364
01:30:34,595 --> 01:30:36,805
When you find the star
where fire and water

1365
01:30:36,806 --> 01:30:40,016
can live together, promise
you won't forget me.

1366
01:30:40,017 --> 01:30:43,186
- I'll remember you as long as I live.

1367
01:30:43,187 --> 01:30:44,729
- That makes me happy.

1368
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:46,148
Because now, you see,

1369
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:49,192
I know that I'll be
with you there forever.

1370
01:30:49,193 --> 01:30:50,360
- Don't die, Bibble.

1371
01:30:50,361 --> 01:30:51,987
Please, don't die.

1372
01:30:51,988 --> 01:30:54,489
- Here, take this.

1373
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:57,326
I won't need it now, and
it's all that I have to give.

1374
01:30:59,787 --> 01:31:01,789
(gasps)

1375
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:05,626
(subdued music)

1376
01:31:08,254 --> 01:31:09,755
- [Syrius] Bibble!

1377
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:13,467
(crying)

1378
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:14,468
Bibble.

1379
01:31:15,344 --> 01:31:16,344
Bibble.

1380
01:31:20,349 --> 01:31:22,101
Why did you have to die?

1381
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,147
Why did you have to die?

1382
01:31:42,455 --> 01:31:45,082
(tone warbling)

1383
01:32:07,563 --> 01:32:08,606
- Huh?

1384
01:32:11,317 --> 01:32:13,194
The Kalea flowers.

1385
01:32:23,955 --> 01:32:25,039
The sun.

1386
01:32:28,584 --> 01:32:33,589
Beautiful.

1387
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:41,389
They're so beautiful flying up to the sun.

1388
01:32:42,056 --> 01:32:43,808
Flying up to the sun!

1389
01:32:50,439 --> 01:32:51,439
Syrius!

1390
01:32:52,275 --> 01:32:53,442
Syrius, hurry!

1391
01:33:02,493 --> 01:33:03,493
Syrius.

1392
01:33:05,621 --> 01:33:08,415
The flowers, they're flying away!

1393
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:10,917
They're flying up to our star!

1394
01:33:10,918 --> 01:33:12,086
Syrius, hurry!

1395
01:33:14,964 --> 01:33:16,298
Oh, no.

1396
01:33:16,299 --> 01:33:17,924
They're leaving without us!

1397
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:20,511
Hurry, before they're all gone!

1398
01:33:22,555 --> 01:33:23,555
No, stop!

1399
01:33:28,853 --> 01:33:30,103
Don't go!

1400
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:31,772
Wait for us, please!

1401
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:43,617
Wait!

1402
01:33:44,577 --> 01:33:45,994
Don't go yet.

1403
01:33:45,995 --> 01:33:47,912
Syrius will be here any moment.

1404
01:33:47,913 --> 01:33:49,914
He will be, I know it.

1405
01:33:49,915 --> 01:33:52,125
He's always kept his word to me.

1406
01:33:52,126 --> 01:33:53,335
Oh, Syrius.

1407
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:55,171
Syrius, where are you?

1408
01:34:12,772 --> 01:34:15,566
(plants creaking)

1409
01:34:45,846 --> 01:34:47,847
It's all over now.

1410
01:34:47,848 --> 01:34:50,642
The Water Child lied to me.

1411
01:34:50,643 --> 01:34:52,144
Syrius will never come.

1412
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:10,079
(tone pulsing)

1413
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:25,928
(chimes clinking)

1414
01:35:53,456 --> 01:35:54,456
- Malta!

1415
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:05,300
Whoa!

1416
01:36:09,096 --> 01:36:10,096
Malta!

1417
01:36:14,185 --> 01:36:15,185
Malta!

1418
01:36:16,812 --> 01:36:17,812
Malta!

1419
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:32,786
Malta, where are you?

1420
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:33,787
I can't.

1421
01:36:42,713 --> 01:36:45,382
(subdued music)

1422
01:37:51,824 --> 01:37:52,824
Malta.

1423
01:37:54,577 --> 01:37:55,743
- [Voices] It's the Water Child!

1424
01:37:55,744 --> 01:37:57,079
The Water Child!

1425
01:38:04,753 --> 01:38:05,753
- Malta.

1426
01:38:06,964 --> 01:38:08,631
(gasps)

1427
01:38:08,632 --> 01:38:09,632
Malta.

1428
01:38:12,595 --> 01:38:13,595
- Syrius.

1429
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:16,723
- [Syrius] Malta, where are you?

1430
01:38:16,724 --> 01:38:17,933
Answer me.

1431
01:38:24,607 --> 01:38:27,484
- It is he, but the eclipse is over.

1432
01:38:28,777 --> 01:38:30,278
- Malta.

1433
01:38:30,279 --> 01:38:31,905
Malta.

1434
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:32,989
- I waited for you.

1435
01:38:32,990 --> 01:38:34,240
I thought you would come.

1436
01:38:34,241 --> 01:38:38,161
But you didn't, and now it's too late.

1437
01:38:38,162 --> 01:38:41,289
- Malta, I know you're there.

1438
01:38:41,290 --> 01:38:44,418
- Water Child, do not call my name.

1439
01:38:52,927 --> 01:38:56,513
- Malta, why don't you answer?

1440
01:39:00,476 --> 01:39:01,810
Where are you?

1441
01:39:05,481 --> 01:39:08,149
(groaning)

1442
01:39:08,150 --> 01:39:08,984
- The sun!

1443
01:39:08,985 --> 01:39:10,777
Go back, the sun!

1444
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:12,195
- Malta, there you are!

1445
01:39:12,196 --> 01:39:13,238
I hear you!

1446
01:39:15,658 --> 01:39:17,283
I'm coming to you!

1447
01:39:17,284 --> 01:39:18,785
I'm coming to you!

1448
01:39:18,786 --> 01:39:19,745
- Go back!

1449
01:39:19,746 --> 01:39:20,912
Stay out of the sun!

1450
01:39:20,913 --> 01:39:22,998
It will kill you, Syrius!

1451
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:30,714
(grunts)

1452
01:39:35,803 --> 01:39:37,261
I...

1453
01:39:37,262 --> 01:39:38,262
I...

1454
01:39:39,014 --> 01:39:41,183
(yelling)

1455
01:39:44,353 --> 01:39:45,478
(gasps)

1456
01:39:45,479 --> 01:39:47,982
(tense music)

1457
01:39:49,608 --> 01:39:51,777
(yelling)

1458
01:39:59,118 --> 01:40:00,452
- Oh, Syrius.

1459
01:40:02,204 --> 01:40:03,204
Syrius.

1460
01:40:05,124 --> 01:40:06,291
What have I done?

1461
01:40:07,209 --> 01:40:09,377
It's too late now.

1462
01:40:09,378 --> 01:40:11,255
Too late.

1463
01:40:12,673 --> 01:40:14,049
No, don't die.

1464
01:40:15,968 --> 01:40:16,968
Syrius.

1465
01:40:19,805 --> 01:40:21,098
Take me with you.

1466
01:40:22,641 --> 01:40:26,060
(Malta sobbing)

1467
01:40:26,061 --> 01:40:28,731
(subdued music)

1468
01:40:36,196 --> 01:40:37,281
Don't touch me!

1469
01:41:00,262 --> 01:41:02,264
Syrius, I will join you.

1470
01:41:06,977 --> 01:41:10,355
I will carry you back
to your home, the water.

1471
01:41:14,026 --> 01:41:18,363
And as you have died in the
sun, I shall die in the sea.

1472
01:41:20,115 --> 01:41:21,992
We will never be separated.

1473
01:41:23,827 --> 01:41:25,162
Never again.

1474
01:41:26,038 --> 01:41:28,791
(dramatic music)

1475
01:41:46,350 --> 01:41:49,186
(chimes clinking)

1476
01:41:58,028 --> 01:42:00,739
- Malta, forgive me, my daughter.

1477
01:42:04,868 --> 01:42:07,621
(waves crashing)

1478
01:42:12,918 --> 01:42:14,920
(gasps)

1479
01:42:19,550 --> 01:42:21,092
- [Oceanus] Behold.

1480
01:42:21,093 --> 01:42:24,555
Were all our troubles caused
by the love of these two

1481
01:42:25,514 --> 01:42:27,641
or by the hatred of others?

1482
01:42:28,809 --> 01:42:32,854
In the beginning, fire
and water were as one.

1483
01:42:32,855 --> 01:42:35,731
Perhaps you two can create a new world,

1484
01:42:35,732 --> 01:42:39,569
such as ours was long, long ago.

1485
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:42,405
Now fly, my children.

1486
01:42:42,406 --> 01:42:46,535
Fly up to your star, and
live forever in happiness.

1487
01:42:48,245 --> 01:42:51,915
(dramatic orchestral music)

1488
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:56,980
- So, there you have it.

1489
01:43:59,316 --> 01:44:02,109
Syrius and Malta floated away

1490
01:44:02,110 --> 01:44:04,238
and were never seen on earth again.

1491
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:10,117
They may be gone, but they're
certainly not forgotten.

1492
01:44:10,118 --> 01:44:12,745
Every time we look up
into the dark heavens,

1493
01:44:12,746 --> 01:44:16,458
we can be reminded of their
undying love for each other.

1494
01:44:17,876 --> 01:44:21,587
For up there, twinkling in the blackness,

1495
01:44:21,588 --> 01:44:26,593
is the star where fire and
water live together as one.

1496
01:44:26,635 --> 01:44:30,305
Needless to say, they are
living happily ever after.

1497
01:44:31,306 --> 01:44:35,059
I often wonder, when I
think of Syrius and Malta

1498
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:38,479
waving at us from that faraway star,

1499
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:41,357
how many other pairs
of star-crossed lovers

1500
