00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:44.679 position:21% line:89% align:start
(electricity buzzing)

00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:55.924 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Student] Well, well,
if it isn't Yuta Okkotsu,

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.859 position:21% line:89% align:start
my favorite weakling.

00:00:57.992 --> 00:01:00.060 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] Don't you come near me.

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:03.196 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, come on, don't
play hard to get.

00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.400 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] I said don't.

00:01:06.534 --> 00:01:10.572 position:16% line:83% align:start
I just wanna slug you one
more time before I graduate.

00:01:10.705 --> 00:01:12.040 position:27% line:89% align:start
(student giggles)

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:15.309 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're not gonna deny me my
graduation present, are you?

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:18.445 position:30% line:83% align:start
Since it's our
last time together.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.882 position:10% line:89% align:start
Maybe I should just kill you.

00:01:21.015 --> 00:01:22.082 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't touch me.

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:23.150 position:44% line:89% align:start
Rika.

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:24.752 position:27% line:89% align:start
(student grunts)

00:01:24.886 --> 00:01:25.920 position:33% line:89% align:start
What you say?

00:01:26.054 --> 00:01:28.856 position:27% line:89% align:start
(student grunts)

00:01:30.925 --> 00:01:33.828 position:24% line:89% align:start
(rain splattering)

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:36.229 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:37.865 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:01:39.634 --> 00:01:40.635 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:01:41.368 --> 00:01:42.369 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.672 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:45.607 --> 00:01:46.674 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:01:46.808 --> 00:01:47.809 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:01:49.978 --> 00:01:52.814 position:30% line:89% align:start
(door creaking)

00:02:06.594 --> 00:02:09.797 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Satoru] A complete cover-up
and a secret execution?

00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:11.599 position:19% line:89% align:start
Boy, that's some story.

00:02:12.767 --> 00:02:15.770 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Director] The child in
question did consent, though.

00:02:15.903 --> 00:02:17.105 position:30% line:89% align:start
He's underage.

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:18.973 position:24% line:89% align:start
Just 16-years-old.

00:02:19.107 --> 00:02:22.610 position:13% line:83% align:start
And who knows how many he's
cursed to death so far.

00:02:22.744 --> 00:02:24.378 position:7% line:89% align:start
He's already turned the tables

00:02:24.512 --> 00:02:28.549 position:10% line:83% align:start
on three grade-two sorcerers
and a grade-one sorcerer.

00:02:29.684 --> 00:02:32.620 position:21% line:83% align:start
Which is exactly the
reason you've turned to me,

00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:36.658 position:13% line:89% align:start
or have you forgotten that?

00:02:36.791 --> 00:02:37.525 position:27% line:89% align:start
(director grunts)

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.192 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Director] So, you'll take him?

00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:40.695 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:02:40.828 --> 00:02:44.866 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yuta Okkotsu, will
attend Jujutsu High School.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.305 position:21% line:83% align:start
You make this in shop
class, Yuta Okkotsu?

00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:56.243 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] It used to be a knife.

00:02:58.012 --> 00:03:03.417 position:19% line:83% align:start
I tried killing myself
but Rika wouldn't let me.

00:03:05.987 --> 00:03:06.888 position:35% line:89% align:start
Kinda dark.

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:09.857 position:27% line:89% align:start
(metal clanging)

00:03:09.991 --> 00:03:11.224 position:35% line:89% align:start
Guess what?

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:13.161 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're starting at
a new school today.

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:14.696 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm not going.

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:15.830 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:03:17.932 --> 00:03:21.169 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Yuta] I don't want to
hurt anyone anymore,

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:23.236 position:24% line:83% align:start
so I'm never going
outside again.

00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:26.507 position:41% line:89% align:start
Never?

00:03:26.641 --> 00:03:28.910 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're gonna get
pretty lonely that way.

00:03:31.813 --> 00:03:33.715 position:24% line:83% align:start
The curse that was
placed upon you.

00:03:33.848 --> 00:03:36.416 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's a curse that
can save people, too,

00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:38.886 position:27% line:83% align:start
depending on how
it's used, of course.

00:03:40.154 --> 00:03:43.524 position:16% line:83% align:start
My advice to you is learn
how to use that power.

00:03:43.658 --> 00:03:46.961 position:16% line:83% align:start
You can cast it all away
later if you still decide to.

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.435 position:27% line:89% align:start
(leaves rustling)

00:04:01.008 --> 00:04:03.945 position:30% line:89% align:start

(birds chirping)

00:06:42.536 --> 00:06:45.773 position:13% line:83% align:start
Did you hear about the new
transfer student coming today?

00:06:45.907 --> 00:06:49.076 position:13% line:83% align:start
They say he stuffed four of
his old classmates in a locker.

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:50.278 position:16% line:89% align:start
You mean he killed them?

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.013 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Tuna mayo?

00:06:52.146 --> 00:06:53.948 position:21% line:89% align:start
No, gravely injured.

00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:55.216 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Maki sighs)

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:58.219 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, if he's cocky, I'll
put him in his place.

00:06:58.352 --> 00:07:00.121 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Bonito flakes.

00:07:00.254 --> 00:07:01.122 position:30% line:89% align:start
(air whooshes)

00:07:01.255 --> 00:07:02.556 position:19% line:89% align:start
Students of all grades,

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.960 position:19% line:89% align:start
we have a new student.

00:07:06.093 --> 00:07:08.129 position:27% line:89% align:start
Give him a hand.

00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:11.966 position:33% line:89% align:start
Not one hand.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.903 position:19% line:83% align:start
I heard that the kid's
a real wet blanket.

00:07:16.037 --> 00:07:19.974 position:5% line:83% align:start
The last thing I need is another
moody rookie to look after.

00:07:20.107 --> 00:07:21.108 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Salmon.

00:07:21.242 --> 00:07:22.109 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:07:23.611 --> 00:07:25.146 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Satoru sighs)

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:26.479 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, well, then.

00:07:27.748 --> 00:07:29.784 position:19% line:89% align:start
You can come on in now.

00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:32.753 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Yuta] I sense a really
dark mood in there.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.162 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Maki] I'll just ignore him.

00:07:44.131 --> 00:07:46.968 position:27% line:89% align:start
(ground rumbling)

00:07:50.604 --> 00:07:53.808 position:24% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

00:07:54.408 --> 00:07:56.043 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:07:56.177 --> 00:07:58.112 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:07:58.245 --> 00:07:59.347 position:38% line:89% align:start
I'm Yuta.

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:00.848 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(sword whooshes)
-(metal clangs)

00:08:00.982 --> 00:08:03.284 position:13% line:89% align:start
Is this some kind of test?

00:08:03.417 --> 00:08:05.186 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta sighs)

00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:06.520 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey.

00:08:07.688 --> 00:08:10.791 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't you know that
you are cursed?

00:08:10.925 --> 00:08:13.361 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is a place to
learn about curses.

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:16.130 position:13% line:83% align:start
Not a place for the cursed
to be hanging around.

00:08:19.066 --> 00:08:21.369 position:16% line:83% align:start
The number of people that
die mysterious deaths

00:08:21.502 --> 00:08:25.973 position:16% line:83% align:start
or go missing in Japan is
over 10,000 a year on average.

00:08:26.107 --> 00:08:29.377 position:16% line:83% align:start
The majority of those are
actually not accidents,

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:30.845 position:21% line:89% align:start
but caused by curses.

00:08:30.978 --> 00:08:32.546 position:10% line:89% align:start
Born from negative emotions.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.283 position:10% line:83% align:start
Among them are also some evil
cases caused by curse users.

00:08:36.417 --> 00:08:40.154 position:21% line:83% align:start
You see, only curses
can affect other curses.

00:08:40.287 --> 00:08:41.789 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta gasps)

00:08:41.922 --> 00:08:44.558 position:10% line:83% align:start
This place is where we learn
curses to exorcize curses.

00:08:44.692 --> 00:08:47.228 position:27% line:83% align:start
Welcome to Tokyo
Jujutsu High School.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:52.033 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Yuta] He's just
telling me this now?

00:08:52.166 --> 00:08:53.167 position:35% line:89% align:start
[All] What?

00:08:53.834 --> 00:08:56.505 position:5% line:89% align:start
He's just telling him that now?

00:08:56.637 --> 00:08:57.838 position:41% line:89% align:start
My bad.

00:08:58.806 --> 00:09:01.242 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, you all should back
away pretty quickly.

00:09:01.375 --> 00:09:02.243 position:35% line:89% align:start
[All] Huh?

00:09:04.345 --> 00:09:06.914 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Panda groans)

00:09:07.848 --> 00:09:09.183 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Rika] Do not.

00:09:10.217 --> 00:09:11.352 position:38% line:89% align:start
Stop it.

00:09:11.485 --> 00:09:13.054 position:44% line:89% align:start
Rika.

00:09:13.187 --> 00:09:14.855 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Rika] Bully Yuta.

00:09:22.696 --> 00:09:26.000 position:27% line:89% align:start

00:09:26.133 --> 00:09:26.901 position:33% line:89% align:start

00:09:27.034 --> 00:09:28.169 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Girl] Over there, over there.

00:09:28.302 --> 00:09:29.203 position:30% line:83% align:start
-(kid giggles)
-[Boy] What is it?

00:09:29.336 --> 00:09:30.337 position:35% line:89% align:start
What is it?

00:09:31.138 --> 00:09:34.141 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yuta, I have a
birthday gift for you.

00:09:34.275 --> 00:09:35.576 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

00:09:35.709 --> 00:09:37.111 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:09:37.244 --> 00:09:38.212 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Yuta chuckles)

00:09:38.345 --> 00:09:40.014 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

00:09:40.147 --> 00:09:41.082 position:30% line:89% align:start
Can I open it?

00:09:41.215 --> 00:09:42.083 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Rika] Go ahead.

00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:43.084 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Yuta chuckles)

00:09:43.217 --> 00:09:43.951 position:41% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:09:44.085 --> 00:09:46.787 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Rika] Yes, I said go ahead.

00:09:51.092 --> 00:09:51.759 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:51.892 --> 00:09:53.060 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's a ring.

00:09:53.694 --> 00:09:55.729 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Rika] An engagement ring.

00:09:55.863 --> 00:09:57.298 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] Engagement?

00:09:57.431 --> 00:10:00.201 position:27% line:89% align:start
(romantic music)

00:10:09.076 --> 00:10:12.246 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's a promise that
when we grow up,

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.282 position:24% line:83% align:start
we're going to get
married to each other.

00:10:17.451 --> 00:10:20.654 position:33% line:89% align:start
(car crashes)

00:10:20.788 --> 00:10:21.822 position:30% line:89% align:start
(woman shouts)

00:10:21.956 --> 00:10:23.090 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Driver] I didn't
mean to hit her.

00:10:23.224 --> 00:10:24.792 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Man] Someone,
call an ambulance.

00:10:24.925 --> 00:10:26.293 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Woman] Look at her,
call the coroner.

00:10:26.427 --> 00:10:28.662 position:16% line:83% align:start
(woman sighs) There's no
way she's gonna make it.

00:10:28.796 --> 00:10:29.763 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Man] What happened?

00:10:29.897 --> 00:10:31.499 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Woman] Her head's crushed in.

00:10:31.632 --> 00:10:32.900 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Man] How horrible.

00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:34.768 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Man] Yes, a child
got run over by a car.

00:10:34.902 --> 00:10:36.538 position:21% line:89% align:start
I don't know, hurry.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.038 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Man] We should help her.

00:10:38.172 --> 00:10:39.508 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Woman] I'm not going near that.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.774 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Man] That poor girl.

00:10:40.908 --> 00:10:42.176 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Woman] Oh, this
is heartbreaking.

00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:43.310 position:44% line:89% align:start
Rika?

00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:46.380 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Rika] Yuta.

00:10:48.315 --> 00:10:50.317 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

00:10:50.451 --> 00:10:53.254 position:24% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

00:10:55.823 --> 00:10:57.024 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yuta.

00:10:59.927 --> 00:11:02.363 position:27% line:89% align:start
When we grow up,

00:11:02.663 --> 00:11:06.967 position:16% line:89% align:start
we're gonna get married.

00:11:07.268 --> 00:11:11.372 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(suspenseful music)
-(Yuta groans)

00:11:11.506 --> 00:11:12.740 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's a promise.

00:11:12.873 --> 00:11:14.141 position:24% line:89% align:start
So, as you can see,

00:11:14.275 --> 00:11:15.976 position:24% line:83% align:start
this boy was cursed
by his friend Rika,

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.279 position:24% line:83% align:start
who is still madly
in love with him.

00:11:18.412 --> 00:11:23.817 position:19% line:83% align:start
Be nice to him or else
Rika will get you.

00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:25.486 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Panda groans)

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.054 position:10% line:89% align:start
Remember, if you attack Yuta,

00:11:27.188 --> 00:11:30.224 position:13% line:83% align:start
Rika's curse will activate
or maybe it won't.

00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:31.425 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's hard to say.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.228 position:16% line:89% align:start
So be careful, everyone.

00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:35.829 position:27% line:89% align:start
Now he tells us.

00:11:35.963 --> 00:11:38.299 position:21% line:83% align:start
Since these students
are acting all cool.

00:11:38.432 --> 00:11:40.635 position:21% line:83% align:start
Let me introduce them
to you real quick-like.

00:11:40.768 --> 00:11:43.204 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Yuta] I have a feeling
this teacher's the problem,

00:11:43.337 --> 00:11:44.606 position:27% line:89% align:start
not the students.

00:11:44.738 --> 00:11:47.208 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Satoru] This is the cursed
tool user, Maki Zen'in.

00:11:47.341 --> 00:11:50.177 position:19% line:83% align:start
She uses special tools
to exorcize curses.

00:11:51.345 --> 00:11:53.847 position:16% line:83% align:start
This is the cursed speech
user, Toge Inumaki.

00:11:53.981 --> 00:11:55.783 position:21% line:83% align:start
He can only speak in
rice ball ingredients,

00:11:55.916 --> 00:11:57.318 position:21% line:89% align:start
so have fun chatting.

00:11:57.451 --> 00:11:58.319 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Kelp.

00:11:58.452 --> 00:11:59.320 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Satoru] And Panda.

00:11:59.453 --> 00:12:00.387 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hi, I'm Panda.

00:12:00.522 --> 00:12:02.056 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's nice to meet you.

00:12:02.189 --> 00:12:05.025 position:21% line:89% align:start
Okay, you're all set.

00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:08.229 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Yuta] But I'm still not
sure what I'm doing here.

00:12:08.362 --> 00:12:09.531 position:30% line:89% align:start
All right then,

00:12:09.664 --> 00:12:12.800 position:19% line:83% align:start
our first year class is
a solid four students.

00:12:12.933 --> 00:12:15.704 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Yuta] Three students
and one animal anyway.

00:12:15.836 --> 00:12:18.205 position:24% line:83% align:start
For your afternoon
jujutsu practice,

00:12:18.339 --> 00:12:20.474 position:24% line:83% align:start
you'll be in pairs
of two on two.

00:12:20.609 --> 00:12:22.644 position:5% line:89% align:start
Toge and Panda, you're one pair.

00:12:22.776 --> 00:12:24.144 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right.

00:12:24.278 --> 00:12:26.413 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Satoru] And Maki,
you're with Yuta.

00:12:26.548 --> 00:12:27.748 position:44% line:89% align:start
DOE.

00:12:27.881 --> 00:12:29.817 position:21% line:89% align:start
Did she just say DOE?

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.920 position:27% line:89% align:start
(birds chirping)

00:12:35.489 --> 00:12:39.527 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey, I really hope
we can work together.

00:12:41.929 --> 00:12:44.999 position:27% line:83% align:start
You were bullied,
I can totally tell.

00:12:45.132 --> 00:12:47.268 position:24% line:89% align:start
(lightning crashes)

00:12:47.401 --> 00:12:49.236 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.772 position:19% line:83% align:start
I take it by that lame
reaction, I'm right.

00:12:51.905 --> 00:12:54.475 position:24% line:83% align:start
I totally get it,
I'd bully you too.

00:12:54.609 --> 00:12:55.744 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

00:12:55.876 --> 00:12:57.344 position:24% line:83% align:start
Maybe it's because
you're cursed?

00:12:57.478 --> 00:12:59.581 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's written on your face
that you're trying to come off

00:12:59.714 --> 00:13:00.582 position:21% line:89% align:start
as a goody-two-shoes.

00:13:00.715 --> 00:13:01.750 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's sickening.

00:13:01.882 --> 00:13:03.050 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta gasps)

00:13:03.183 --> 00:13:04.318 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why are you acting
like the victim

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:06.253 position:24% line:83% align:start
when you're the one
being protected?

00:13:06.387 --> 00:13:08.856 position:24% line:83% align:start
I bet, you've been
passive your whole life.

00:13:08.989 --> 00:13:10.291 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

00:13:10.424 --> 00:13:12.727 position:16% line:83% align:start
Believe me, Jujutsu High
isn't gonna be that easy.

00:13:13.427 --> 00:13:15.963 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're gonna have to step
up if you wanna make it.

00:13:16.096 --> 00:13:17.498 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

00:13:17.632 --> 00:13:18.533 position:44% line:89% align:start
Maki.

00:13:18.667 --> 00:13:20.467 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's enough of that.

00:13:20.602 --> 00:13:21.569 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Bonito flakes.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.305 position:35% line:89% align:start
Okay, fine.

00:13:24.438 --> 00:13:25.540 position:27% line:89% align:start
Get off my case.

00:13:26.608 --> 00:13:28.042 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sorry about her.

00:13:28.175 --> 00:13:29.810 position:19% line:83% align:start
She has a bad habit of
thinking she's an authority

00:13:29.943 --> 00:13:31.145 position:27% line:89% align:start
on mind-reading.

00:13:31.845 --> 00:13:34.582 position:27% line:89% align:start
No, she's right.

00:13:40.087 --> 00:13:41.455 position:24% line:89% align:start
(footsteps tapping)

00:13:41.589 --> 00:13:42.856 position:33% line:89% align:start
Where are we?

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.526 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Satoru] It's just
an elementary school.

00:13:44.659 --> 00:13:45.859 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] Huh?

00:13:45.993 --> 00:13:47.828 position:24% line:83% align:start
Or rather, just an
elementary school

00:13:47.961 --> 00:13:49.830 position:24% line:83% align:start
where some children
have gone missing.

00:13:49.963 --> 00:13:51.332 position:33% line:89% align:start
Gone missing?

00:13:51.465 --> 00:13:53.601 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Satoru] It happens a
lot in places like this.

00:13:53.735 --> 00:13:57.071 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's probably the work of a
naturally-occurring curse.

00:13:57.971 --> 00:13:59.440 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta gulps)

00:13:59.574 --> 00:14:01.643 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are you saying a curse
actually kidnapped some kids?

00:14:01.776 --> 00:14:04.445 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yup, two kids so far.

00:14:04.579 --> 00:14:07.448 position:21% line:83% align:start
Curses tend to settle
in spots like these.

00:14:07.582 --> 00:14:10.317 position:27% line:83% align:start
Places where bad
memories occurred.

00:14:11.586 --> 00:14:13.688 position:24% line:89% align:start
Schools, hospitals.

00:14:13.822 --> 00:14:15.189 position:19% line:89% align:start
Places often remembered

00:14:15.322 --> 00:14:18.660 position:13% line:83% align:start
with negative emotions are
a receptacle for curses.

00:14:18.793 --> 00:14:20.094 position:13% line:89% align:start
As those emotions build up,

00:14:20.227 --> 00:14:22.463 position:27% line:83% align:start
they can cause a
curse to be born.

00:14:22.597 --> 00:14:23.598 position:27% line:89% align:start
Like it was here.

00:14:24.699 --> 00:14:27.000 position:13% line:83% align:start
We're here to exorcize the
curse, and save the kids

00:14:27.134 --> 00:14:29.002 position:27% line:83% align:start
Or retrieve them
if they're dead.

00:14:29.136 --> 00:14:30.538 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

00:14:30.672 --> 00:14:31.539 position:44% line:89% align:start
Dead?

00:14:33.374 --> 00:14:36.210 position:21% line:83% align:start
Emerge from darkness
blacker still.

00:14:36.343 --> 00:14:38.847 position:10% line:89% align:start
Purify that which is impure.

00:14:38.979 --> 00:14:42.383 position:27% line:89% align:start
(veil crackling)

00:14:42.517 --> 00:14:43.484 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:43.618 --> 00:14:45.653 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's turning into night.

00:14:46.987 --> 00:14:48.389 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's a veil.

00:14:48.523 --> 00:14:51.191 position:21% line:83% align:start
A barrier of sorts to
help smoke out the curses.

00:14:51.325 --> 00:14:53.595 position:19% line:83% align:start
It also keeps us hidden
from the outside.

00:14:55.329 --> 00:14:58.031 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's pretty easy to
undo from inside.

00:15:00.702 --> 00:15:02.403 position:13% line:89% align:start
Do be careful now, you two.

00:15:03.571 --> 00:15:04.572 position:30% line:89% align:start
Try not to die.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.542 position:35% line:89% align:start
Die? Gojo?

00:15:07.675 --> 00:15:08.543 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Maki] Transfer student.

00:15:08.676 --> 00:15:09.677 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:10.477 --> 00:15:12.547 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't let yourself
get distracted.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.683 position:24% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

00:15:17.752 --> 00:15:18.620 position:47% line:89% align:start
Put

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:20.421 position:47% line:89% align:start
me

00:15:21.088 --> 00:15:22.289 position:47% line:89% align:start
on!

00:15:23.023 --> 00:15:25.527 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

00:15:26.728 --> 00:15:27.595 position:35% line:89% align:start
Put me on.

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:31.833 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] They're coming this way.

00:15:31.965 --> 00:15:32.901 position:30% line:89% align:start
What do we do?

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:34.602 position:30% line:89% align:start
Stop screaming.

00:15:34.736 --> 00:15:37.004 position:30% line:89% align:start
(air whooshing)

00:15:37.137 --> 00:15:38.439 position:24% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

00:15:38.573 --> 00:15:41.810 position:24% line:83% align:start
Just remember this,
the weaker curses are,

00:15:41.942 --> 00:15:43.578 position:10% line:89% align:start
the more they group together.

00:15:44.579 --> 00:15:47.414 position:27% line:89% align:start
(stick whooshing)

00:15:49.383 --> 00:15:52.986 position:16% line:83% align:start
Of course, the same could
be said for human beings.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.421 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] Incredible.

00:15:54.556 --> 00:15:56.591 position:19% line:83% align:start
She wiped them all out
with a single blow.

00:15:58.392 --> 00:16:00.093 position:13% line:89% align:start
Okay, let's get a move on.

00:16:00.227 --> 00:16:01.295 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] Huh?

00:16:01.428 --> 00:16:02.630 position:38% line:89% align:start
Where to?

00:16:02.764 --> 00:16:04.566 position:24% line:89% align:start
Inside, obviously.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.538 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Yuta breathes deeply)

00:16:14.742 --> 00:16:16.310 position:19% line:89% align:start
Miss Zen'in, aren't you

00:16:16.443 --> 00:16:18.613 position:21% line:83% align:start
at least a little bit
scared of this place?

00:16:18.746 --> 00:16:20.314 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't use my last name.

00:16:21.148 --> 00:16:22.550 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sorry.

00:16:22.684 --> 00:16:25.219 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's just, this place is
really giving me the creeps.

00:16:25.352 --> 00:16:28.388 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's exactly the type of
place where ghosts would be.

00:16:28.523 --> 00:16:29.958 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Maki] There aren't
many curses here,

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.992 position:30% line:83% align:start
even though the
veil's been drawn.

00:16:33.126 --> 00:16:35.663 position:24% line:89% align:start
No, they are here,

00:16:35.797 --> 00:16:37.464 position:13% line:89% align:start
they're just not attacking.

00:16:38.432 --> 00:16:41.301 position:30% line:83% align:start
I wonder, is it
because he's here?

00:16:41.636 --> 00:16:42.302 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

00:16:42.436 --> 00:16:43.671 position:21% line:89% align:start
Something just moved.

00:16:43.805 --> 00:16:44.706 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Maki] Hey?

00:16:44.839 --> 00:16:45.807 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] What?

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.542 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Maki] What grade are you?

00:16:48.475 --> 00:16:50.043 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] Like in school?

00:16:50.177 --> 00:16:53.615 position:10% line:83% align:start
Jujutsu sorcerers are ranked
in grades from four to one.

00:16:53.748 --> 00:16:55.148 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah, but, I only started

00:16:55.282 --> 00:16:57.752 position:30% line:83% align:start
at Jujutsu High
School this week.

00:16:57.886 --> 00:16:59.654 position:10% line:89% align:start
I don't think I'm ranked yet.

00:16:59.787 --> 00:17:00.655 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Maki grunts)

00:17:00.788 --> 00:17:02.155 position:35% line:89% align:start
Forget it.

00:17:02.289 --> 00:17:03.691 position:16% line:89% align:start
Show me your student ID.

00:17:03.825 --> 00:17:06.594 position:16% line:83% align:start
The one you got from that
dumb blindfolded guy.

00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:09.062 position:21% line:89% align:start
Dumb blindfolded guy?

00:17:10.698 --> 00:17:12.366 position:24% line:89% align:start
Okay, here you go.

00:17:12.499 --> 00:17:16.638 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, if you just joined,
you're probably a grade four.

00:17:16.771 --> 00:17:17.705 position:30% line:89% align:start
Special-grade?

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.409 position:19% line:83% align:start
Special-grade is even a
higher ranking than Grade One,

00:17:22.544 --> 00:17:25.947 position:10% line:83% align:start
This must be some kind of a
practical joke or something.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:26.948 position:33% line:89% align:start
Miss Zen'in.

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:27.949 position:33% line:89% align:start
Miss Zen'in.

00:17:28.081 --> 00:17:29.249 position:35% line:89% align:start
Behind you.

00:17:29.851 --> 00:17:32.252 position:24% line:89% align:start
(monster crackling)

00:17:32.386 --> 00:17:35.055 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(ground rumbles)
-(Yuta groans)

00:17:35.188 --> 00:17:37.725 position:27% line:89% align:start
(explosion booms)

00:17:37.859 --> 00:17:40.862 position:27% line:89% align:start
(monster growls)

00:17:40.995 --> 00:17:41.896 position:27% line:89% align:start
(monster growls)

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.631 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Yuta screams)

00:17:43.765 --> 00:17:45.198 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Maki] Shit.

00:17:45.332 --> 00:17:46.768 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're way too damn big.

00:17:48.036 --> 00:17:49.971 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Maki shouts)

00:17:50.103 --> 00:17:52.306 position:27% line:89% align:start
(monster growls)

00:17:52.439 --> 00:17:55.977 position:30% line:83% align:start
-(metal clangs)
-(Maki grunts)

00:17:56.109 --> 00:17:57.411 position:30% line:89% align:start
(monster gulps)

00:17:57.545 --> 00:17:58.513 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yum.

00:17:59.047 --> 00:18:00.682 position:30% line:89% align:start
(monster burps)

00:18:00.815 --> 00:18:02.750 position:19% line:89% align:start
Thank you for the meal.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:06.486 position:33% line:89% align:start
(foot thuds)

00:18:06.621 --> 00:18:07.287 position:44% line:89% align:start
Shit.

00:18:07.421 --> 00:18:08.890 position:16% line:89% align:start
I dropped my cursed tool.

00:18:09.023 --> 00:18:10.792 position:24% line:89% align:start
Let us out of here.

00:18:14.194 --> 00:18:15.495 position:27% line:89% align:start
Where are we now?

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:17.799 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're stuck in this
dumb curse's stomach.

00:18:17.932 --> 00:18:20.535 position:30% line:83% align:start
No reason to go
passing out over this.

00:18:20.668 --> 00:18:22.604 position:13% line:89% align:start
You mean that curse ate us?

00:18:22.737 --> 00:18:25.272 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's right. And I thought you
were supposed to be protected

00:18:25.405 --> 00:18:26.908 position:19% line:89% align:start
by that curse of yours?

00:18:27.041 --> 00:18:28.342 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] Don't blame me,

00:18:28.475 --> 00:18:30.578 position:16% line:83% align:start
I have no idea what makes
Rika decide to come out.

00:18:30.712 --> 00:18:32.479 position:10% line:89% align:start
But what are we gonna do now?

00:18:32.614 --> 00:18:34.448 position:24% line:83% align:start
After a while the
veil will go away,

00:18:34.582 --> 00:18:36.149 position:13% line:89% align:start
and help will come for us.

00:18:36.283 --> 00:18:37.150 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Maki grunts)

00:18:37.284 --> 00:18:38.452 position:33% line:89% align:start
Embarrassing.

00:18:38.586 --> 00:18:39.721 position:44% line:89% align:start
Shit.

00:18:39.854 --> 00:18:40.989 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Boy] Please help.

00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:41.990 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:42.991 position:33% line:89% align:start
Who's there?

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:44.092 position:30% line:89% align:start
Please help me,

00:18:44.224 --> 00:18:45.893 position:16% line:89% align:start
my friend's about to die.

00:18:47.061 --> 00:18:48.830 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

00:18:48.963 --> 00:18:50.397 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta gulps)

00:18:50.531 --> 00:18:53.101 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are you saying a curse
actually kidnapped some kid?

00:18:53.233 --> 00:18:55.435 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yup, two kids so far.

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:58.338 position:13% line:83% align:start
We're here to exorcize the
curse, and save the kids

00:18:58.472 --> 00:19:00.307 position:27% line:83% align:start
or retrieve them
if they're dead.

00:19:00.975 --> 00:19:02.275 position:30% line:89% align:start
Thank goodness.

00:19:02.409 --> 00:19:03.578 position:30% line:89% align:start
They're alive.

00:19:03.711 --> 00:19:04.812 position:33% line:89% align:start
Just barely.

00:19:04.946 --> 00:19:05.813 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:05.947 --> 00:19:06.814 position:21% line:89% align:start
Look at them closer.

00:19:07.815 --> 00:19:11.451 position:10% line:83% align:start
The big one's obviously been
affected by the curse, too.

00:19:11.586 --> 00:19:13.721 position:24% line:83% align:start
Both of them could
die at any minute.

00:19:15.089 --> 00:19:15.957 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh, no.

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:16.958 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

00:19:17.091 --> 00:19:17.959 position:30% line:89% align:start
What do we do?

00:19:18.092 --> 00:19:19.459 position:35% line:89% align:start
I told you.

00:19:19.594 --> 00:19:21.796 position:5% line:89% align:start
All we can do is wait for help.

00:19:21.929 --> 00:19:23.463 position:16% line:89% align:start
Not everyone's like you.

00:19:23.598 --> 00:19:26.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
Most people don't have
resistance to curses.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.168 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:28.301 --> 00:19:29.469 position:33% line:89% align:start
Miss Zen'in?

00:19:30.038 --> 00:19:31.673 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Maki groans)

00:19:31.806 --> 00:19:32.807 position:44% line:89% align:start
Maki.

00:19:35.009 --> 00:19:35.943 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta gasps)

00:19:36.077 --> 00:19:37.812 position:13% line:89% align:start
What kind of wound is this?

00:19:39.614 --> 00:19:42.315 position:30% line:83% align:start
Does this mean
you're cursed now?

00:19:42.449 --> 00:19:44.886 position:21% line:89% align:start
Is she going to die?

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.824 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please, I don't want to die too.

00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:52.259 position:35% line:89% align:start
(boy cries)

00:19:52.392 --> 00:19:53.594 position:41% line:89% align:start
Please.

00:19:54.629 --> 00:19:56.531 position:10% line:89% align:start
I don't know how to save you.

00:19:57.699 --> 00:19:58.566 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.801 position:38% line:89% align:start
Okkotsu.

00:19:59.934 --> 00:20:04.072 position:21% line:83% align:start
Tell me, why did you
come to Jujutsu High?

00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:05.807 position:16% line:89% align:start
What is it you wanna do?

00:20:08.009 --> 00:20:08.876 position:27% line:89% align:start
What do you want?

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:09.944 position:24% line:89% align:start
What're your goals?

00:20:10.078 --> 00:20:11.846 position:5% line:89% align:start
What are you trying to achieve?

00:20:12.814 --> 00:20:17.151 position:19% line:83% align:start
I just don't wanna see
anyone getting hurt again.

00:20:18.119 --> 00:20:21.689 position:19% line:83% align:start
I tried to lock myself
away and disappear.

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:26.027 position:24% line:83% align:start
But Gojo warned me
I'd be too lonely.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.862 position:7% line:89% align:start
And I couldn't argue with him.

00:20:29.697 --> 00:20:32.133 position:10% line:89% align:start
I don't want to be all alone.

00:20:32.265 --> 00:20:34.936 position:5% line:89% align:start
I want to be needed by someone.

00:20:35.069 --> 00:20:38.906 position:16% line:83% align:start
I want it to be all right
to know that I'm alive.

00:20:41.542 --> 00:20:42.844 position:27% line:89% align:start
Fine, do it then.

00:20:44.879 --> 00:20:47.949 position:19% line:83% align:start
Keep exorcizing curses
over and over again.

00:20:48.816 --> 00:20:50.585 position:10% line:89% align:start
And when you get good at it,

00:20:50.718 --> 00:20:52.954 position:30% line:83% align:start
confidence and
friends will find you.

00:20:54.354 --> 00:20:59.560 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's why we're
here at Jujutsu High.

00:20:59.927 --> 00:21:02.029 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gentle music)

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.139 position:30% line:89% align:start
(metal clangs)

00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:12.472 position:44% line:89% align:start
Rika.

00:21:13.608 --> 00:21:14.809 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Rika] Yes, Yuta?

00:21:16.844 --> 00:21:19.279 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] Lend me your strength.

00:21:19.412 --> 00:21:21.983 position:33% line:89% align:start
(metal dings)

00:21:22.116 --> 00:21:24.919 position:27% line:89% align:start
(monster groans)

00:21:28.321 --> 00:21:31.692 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Rika screams)

00:21:31.826 --> 00:21:32.827 position:33% line:89% align:start
Who are you?

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:33.961 position:33% line:89% align:start
Who are you?

00:21:35.096 --> 00:21:37.598 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Rika grunts)

00:21:42.804 --> 00:21:46.007 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Rika] That's enough out of you.

00:21:48.009 --> 00:21:48.876 position:27% line:89% align:start
(blood splashes)

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:50.377 position:19% line:89% align:start
Now that's terrifying.

00:21:51.444 --> 00:21:53.681 position:7% line:89% align:start
Rika Orimoto at her strongest.

00:21:53.815 --> 00:21:55.917 position:5% line:89% align:start
Impressive special-grade curse.

00:21:57.051 --> 00:21:58.152 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Satoru giggles)

00:21:58.286 --> 00:21:59.520 position:38% line:89% align:start
So scary.

00:22:00.888 --> 00:22:01.889 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, wow.

00:22:02.523 --> 00:22:03.724 position:35% line:89% align:start
Look at me.

00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:05.860 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm so pretty.

00:22:07.427 --> 00:22:09.462 position:35% line:89% align:start
I love it.

00:22:10.998 --> 00:22:13.701 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

00:22:19.173 --> 00:22:20.373 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right.

00:22:20.508 --> 00:22:22.810 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's just a little
further everybody.

00:22:23.845 --> 00:22:27.114 position:16% line:83% align:start
I need to get Miss Zen'in
and these kids to Gojo.

00:22:27.248 --> 00:22:30.885 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hopefully, Rika keeps
those curses distracted.

00:22:31.018 --> 00:22:33.521 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

00:22:35.189 --> 00:22:37.892 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta grunts)

00:22:40.027 --> 00:22:41.963 position:33% line:89% align:start
I can't stop.

00:22:43.396 --> 00:22:44.999 position:38% line:89% align:start
Not yet.

00:22:45.132 --> 00:22:47.835 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta grunts)

00:22:49.402 --> 00:22:52.006 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm not gonna be weak anymore.

00:22:52.139 --> 00:22:53.507 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna change.

00:22:53.641 --> 00:22:54.842 position:33% line:89% align:start
Here and now.

00:22:57.377 --> 00:23:01.148 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Rika] Yuta, you can do it.

00:23:06.087 --> 00:23:07.154 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes, I can.

00:23:08.089 --> 00:23:10.892 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gentle music)

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.861 position:33% line:89% align:start
Welcome back.

00:23:15.162 --> 00:23:16.163 position:33% line:89% align:start
You did well.

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:26.741 position:13% line:83% align:start
They say both Maki and the
kids are going to be fine.

00:23:27.708 --> 00:23:29.043 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's a relief.

00:23:30.011 --> 00:23:32.546 position:21% line:83% align:start
Funny, you don't look
very relieved to me.

00:23:34.248 --> 00:23:35.650 position:38% line:89% align:start
I did it.

00:23:35.783 --> 00:23:38.319 position:27% line:83% align:start
I managed to call
Rika out by myself.

00:23:38.451 --> 00:23:39.620 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, really?

00:23:39.754 --> 00:23:41.856 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's a big step forward.

00:23:41.989 --> 00:23:44.225 position:27% line:89% align:start
(wheels creaking)

00:23:44.358 --> 00:23:47.061 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

00:23:49.263 --> 00:23:51.999 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gentle music)

00:23:55.102 --> 00:23:57.972 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Yuta coughing)

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.769 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] Okay, I'm gonna spin you.

00:24:28.903 --> 00:24:31.138 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Rika and Yuta giggles)

00:24:31.272 --> 00:24:32.940 position:35% line:89% align:start
Stop, Yuta.

00:24:33.074 --> 00:24:36.711 position:24% line:83% align:start
I said stop, you're
gonna make me fall.

00:24:36.844 --> 00:24:38.980 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Rika and Yuta giggles)

00:24:39.113 --> 00:24:40.448 position:16% line:83% align:start
-[Yuta] Rika, you got me.
-[Rika] There.

00:24:40.581 --> 00:24:41.849 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Take that.
-(Rika and Yuta giggles)

00:24:41.983 --> 00:24:43.384 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] You better watch out.

00:24:43.517 --> 00:24:47.021 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Rika and Yuta giggles)

00:24:52.393 --> 00:24:55.262 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Rika] It's a promise
that when we both grow up,

00:24:55.396 --> 00:24:57.865 position:24% line:83% align:start
we're going to get
married to each other.

00:24:59.166 --> 00:25:00.368 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.204 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Rika groans)

00:25:05.006 --> 00:25:08.542 position:24% line:83% align:start
We'll be together,
forever and ever.

00:25:09.443 --> 00:25:10.644 position:33% line:89% align:start
All the time.

00:25:13.314 --> 00:25:14.849 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Satoru] You okay?

00:25:16.217 --> 00:25:17.151 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:25:17.284 --> 00:25:20.154 position:35% line:83% align:start
I was just
remembering something.

00:25:21.222 --> 00:25:24.959 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm starting to think Rika
didn't curse me after all.

00:25:25.092 --> 00:25:28.162 position:16% line:83% align:start
I think I might have been
the one who cursed Rika.

00:25:30.831 --> 00:25:32.666 position:13% line:89% align:start
You very well may be right.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.504 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's no curse more
twisted than love.

00:25:35.636 --> 00:25:38.272 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta cries)

00:25:42.843 --> 00:25:45.880 position:27% line:83% align:start
All right, while
I'm at Jujutsu High,

00:25:46.013 --> 00:25:48.883 position:27% line:83% align:start
there's something
I want to learn.

00:25:49.016 --> 00:25:51.152 position:10% line:89% align:start
I want to break Rika's curse.

00:25:57.391 --> 00:25:58.192 position:16% line:89% align:start
(ambulance siren wailing)

00:25:58.325 --> 00:26:01.028 position:33% line:89% align:start
(door creaks)

00:26:02.263 --> 00:26:05.266 position:24% line:89% align:start
(footsteps tapping)

00:26:11.839 --> 00:26:14.041 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Director] The special-grade
cursed apparition,

00:26:14.175 --> 00:26:18.979 position:19% line:83% align:start
Rika Orimoto was fully
manifested for 442 seconds.

00:26:19.346 --> 00:26:22.049 position:19% line:83% align:start
We entrusted you with
Yuta Okkotsu precisely

00:26:22.183 --> 00:26:24.985 position:24% line:83% align:start
so we could prevent
this sort of thing.

00:26:25.119 --> 00:26:27.321 position:30% line:83% align:start
There's no room
for excuses, Gojo.

00:26:27.455 --> 00:26:30.791 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, that's good, because
I don't have any excuses.

00:26:30.925 --> 00:26:32.927 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Director] How can
you joke about this?

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:35.830 position:24% line:83% align:start
If Rika Orimoto had
remained out of control,

00:26:35.963 --> 00:26:38.365 position:21% line:83% align:start
she could have wiped
out an entire town.

00:26:38.499 --> 00:26:41.635 position:19% line:83% align:start
If she had I would have
risked my life to stop her.

00:26:41.769 --> 00:26:43.737 position:5% line:89% align:start
Listen, now that we've seen it,

00:26:43.871 --> 00:26:46.740 position:16% line:83% align:start
there's only one thing we
can say about that curse.

00:26:46.874 --> 00:26:49.343 position:7% line:89% align:start
And that's I don't understand.

00:26:49.477 --> 00:26:50.778 position:21% line:89% align:start
Why did a little girl

00:26:50.911 --> 00:26:53.214 position:16% line:83% align:start
who wasn't from any line
of jujutsu sorcerers,

00:26:53.347 --> 00:26:56.050 position:19% line:83% align:start
become such an immense
and powerful curse?

00:26:56.183 --> 00:27:00.020 position:13% line:83% align:start
We can't control something
that we don't understand.

00:27:01.021 --> 00:27:02.957 position:24% line:83% align:start
So, it's just gonna
take trial and error.

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:06.026 position:13% line:83% align:start
Leave it alone for a while,
and see how it works out.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.963 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Director] Do not forget,
Yuta Okkotsu's execution

00:27:09.096 --> 00:27:11.533 position:33% line:83% align:start
has only been
temporarily suspended.

00:27:11.665 --> 00:27:13.200 position:21% line:89% align:start
And don't you forget

00:27:14.201 --> 00:27:16.971 position:21% line:83% align:start
that if it comes down
to that decision,

00:27:17.104 --> 00:27:19.173 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll side with Yuta Okkotsu.

00:27:20.641 --> 00:27:22.643 position:24% line:89% align:start
(footsteps tapping)

00:27:22.776 --> 00:27:24.178 position:44% line:89% align:start
Damn.

00:27:24.311 --> 00:27:26.615 position:19% line:83% align:start
Those school directors
are such rude old geezers.

00:27:26.747 --> 00:27:28.883 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't ever wanna
become like them.

00:27:29.016 --> 00:27:31.785 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll have to be careful
that I never do.

00:27:31.919 --> 00:27:33.154 position:24% line:89% align:start
Don't they get it?

00:27:33.287 --> 00:27:35.524 position:16% line:83% align:start
No one should be allowed
to take youth away

00:27:35.656 --> 00:27:36.857 position:24% line:89% align:start
from young people.

00:27:39.293 --> 00:27:42.163 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groaning)

00:27:44.832 --> 00:27:47.301 position:30% line:83% align:start
Maki and Toge,
it's your last lap.

00:27:48.302 --> 00:27:50.171 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groaning)

00:27:50.304 --> 00:27:52.306 position:27% line:83% align:start
No one will take
their youth away.

00:27:59.648 --> 00:28:02.816 position:33% line:89% align:start
(door clicks)

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:04.385 position:27% line:89% align:start
Go in, after you.

00:28:04.519 --> 00:28:05.386 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.387 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:28:11.892 --> 00:28:14.328 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta gasps)

00:28:18.432 --> 00:28:20.935 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's nearly impossible
to exorcize a curse

00:28:21.068 --> 00:28:23.170 position:19% line:89% align:start
as big as Rika Orimoto.

00:28:23.304 --> 00:28:26.340 position:21% line:83% align:start
However, breaking the
curse is a different story.

00:28:26.473 --> 00:28:29.910 position:7% line:83% align:start
You have to identify thousands
of knots of cursed energy,

00:28:30.044 --> 00:28:32.246 position:10% line:89% align:start
and unravel them one by one.

00:28:33.047 --> 00:28:35.149 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's a method that can
only be pursued by you,

00:28:35.282 --> 00:28:37.184 position:10% line:89% align:start
the person that she's cursed.

00:28:37.318 --> 00:28:39.353 position:30% line:83% align:start
What exactly am
I supposed to do?

00:28:39.486 --> 00:28:40.888 position:30% line:89% align:start
Here, use this.

00:28:41.021 --> 00:28:41.855 position:27% line:89% align:start
(sword whooshes)

00:28:41.989 --> 00:28:43.390 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

00:28:43.525 --> 00:28:45.594 position:30% line:89% align:start
Whoa, a katana?

00:28:45.726 --> 00:28:47.228 position:5% line:89% align:start
You see, curses are most stable

00:28:47.361 --> 00:28:49.263 position:33% line:83% align:start
when they're
possessing an object.

00:28:50.064 --> 00:28:51.432 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you remember,
back at that school,

00:28:51.566 --> 00:28:54.201 position:24% line:83% align:start
you used that ring
to connect to Rika.

00:28:54.335 --> 00:28:56.270 position:10% line:89% align:start
The pipeline's already there.

00:28:56.403 --> 00:28:58.906 position:16% line:83% align:start
So now you need to borrow
part of Rika's curse,

00:28:59.039 --> 00:29:01.775 position:27% line:83% align:start
imbue it into the
katana, and control it.

00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:03.877 position:24% line:83% align:start
Increase the amount
as you repeat it,

00:29:04.011 --> 00:29:05.746 position:21% line:83% align:start
and eventually you'll
have the whole curse

00:29:05.879 --> 00:29:07.248 position:24% line:89% align:start
under your control.

00:29:07.381 --> 00:29:09.383 position:27% line:83% align:start
Once you do that,
then you're free.

00:29:11.018 --> 00:29:13.420 position:27% line:89% align:start
Both you and her.

00:29:14.955 --> 00:29:17.324 position:5% line:89% align:start
Imbue the curse into the katana.

00:29:17.458 --> 00:29:19.126 position:24% line:89% align:start
But that's not all.

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:21.696 position:19% line:83% align:start
You also have to learn
how to wield a blade.

00:29:22.396 --> 00:29:24.465 position:21% line:83% align:start
Until you can combine
those two skills,

00:29:24.599 --> 00:29:26.133 position:21% line:89% align:start
you'll still be weak.

00:29:26.267 --> 00:29:29.303 position:7% line:83% align:start
So the first thing we're gonna
do is to get you training.

00:29:33.807 --> 00:29:36.410 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:50.659 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta grunts)

00:29:50.791 --> 00:29:55.462 position:16% line:83% align:start
-(Maki and Yuta grunting)
-(sword stick thudding)

00:29:58.465 --> 00:30:00.367 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Maki and Yuta grunting)

00:30:00.501 --> 00:30:02.169 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, nice.

00:30:02.303 --> 00:30:07.509 position:16% line:83% align:start
-(Maki and Yuta grunting)
-(sword stick thudding)

00:30:20.487 --> 00:30:21.822 position:35% line:89% align:start
What's up?

00:30:21.955 --> 00:30:23.658 position:30% line:89% align:start
How's it going?

00:30:23.792 --> 00:30:24.858 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, It's going.

00:30:24.992 --> 00:30:26.126 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta grunts)

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.128 position:10% line:89% align:start
Don't get distracted, newbie.

00:30:28.996 --> 00:30:30.264 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, right.

00:30:30.397 --> 00:30:32.366 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Maki] Don't just stand
there, take your stance.

00:30:32.499 --> 00:30:33.467 position:41% line:89% align:start
Idiot.

00:30:33.601 --> 00:30:34.602 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sorry.

00:30:35.436 --> 00:30:37.971 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are you gonna land a
blow sometime today?

00:30:39.808 --> 00:30:41.308 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, right now.

00:30:42.476 --> 00:30:44.546 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:30:44.679 --> 00:30:50.050 position:16% line:83% align:start
-(Maki and Yuta grunting)
-(sword stick thudding)

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:58.258 position:27% line:89% align:start
She dodged that?

00:30:58.959 --> 00:31:00.528 position:13% line:89% align:start
But now she's off-balance.

00:31:00.662 --> 00:31:02.162 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll get her on the landing.

00:31:03.665 --> 00:31:04.498 position:27% line:89% align:start
(stick whooshes)

00:31:04.632 --> 00:31:05.933 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way.

00:31:06.066 --> 00:31:09.069 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Maki and Yuta grunting)

00:31:09.203 --> 00:31:10.070 position:30% line:83% align:start
-(Maki grunts)
-(stick thuds)

00:31:10.204 --> 00:31:11.506 position:19% line:89% align:start
Congrats, you're dead.

00:31:12.473 --> 00:31:14.241 position:27% line:83% align:start
I win again, and
remain undefeated.

00:31:14.375 --> 00:31:16.511 position:10% line:89% align:start
Was that last part necessary?

00:31:16.644 --> 00:31:18.045 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't be so soft.

00:31:18.178 --> 00:31:20.849 position:5% line:83% align:start
You should always treat training
like it's a real battle.

00:31:20.981 --> 00:31:22.584 position:27% line:83% align:start
Both experiencing
pain and avoiding pain

00:31:22.717 --> 00:31:25.352 position:19% line:83% align:start
makes a huge difference
in how fast you grow.

00:31:26.621 --> 00:31:29.923 position:21% line:83% align:start
She's right, I gotta
get back in there.

00:31:30.759 --> 00:31:31.959 position:27% line:89% align:start
One more, please.

00:31:32.761 --> 00:31:34.194 position:21% line:89% align:start
I have to get better.

00:31:35.362 --> 00:31:38.932 position:16% line:83% align:start
If I don't improve, I'll
never break Rika's curse.

00:31:40.234 --> 00:31:42.202 position:16% line:83% align:start
-(Maki and Yuta grunting)
-(sword stick thudding)

00:31:42.336 --> 00:31:45.339 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's been three months since
Yuta came to Jujutsu High.

00:31:45.472 --> 00:31:47.876 position:27% line:83% align:start
His movements are
getting better every day.

00:31:48.008 --> 00:31:49.309 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Salmon.

00:31:49.443 --> 00:31:51.579 position:21% line:83% align:start
Even his personality
is more positive now.

00:31:51.713 --> 00:31:53.013 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Salmon roe.

00:31:53.147 --> 00:31:55.315 position:16% line:83% align:start
And Maki looks like she's
having more fun too.

00:31:55.449 --> 00:31:58.686 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't think she got to spar
very often with other weapon.

00:31:59.721 --> 00:32:00.588 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Panda gasps)

00:32:00.722 --> 00:32:02.791 position:19% line:89% align:start
I've had a revelation.

00:32:02.923 --> 00:32:04.526 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, Yuta.

00:32:04.659 --> 00:32:05.527 position:35% line:89% align:start
Come here.

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:06.795 position:30% line:89% align:start
Come over here.

00:32:06.927 --> 00:32:08.596 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:10.097 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's up, Panda?

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:11.833 position:19% line:83% align:start
We have to have a super
important discussion,

00:32:11.965 --> 00:32:13.535 position:27% line:89% align:start
so listen close.

00:32:13.668 --> 00:32:16.937 position:16% line:83% align:start
What do you like better,
big or small boobs?

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:18.573 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:32:18.706 --> 00:32:19.973 position:19% line:89% align:start
To tell you the truth,

00:32:20.107 --> 00:32:20.941 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've never given it
much thought before.

00:32:21.074 --> 00:32:22.744 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:32:23.277 --> 00:32:25.580 position:16% line:83% align:start
I guess given the choice
I like them somewhat big?

00:32:25.713 --> 00:32:27.615 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, really?

00:32:27.749 --> 00:32:29.517 position:44% line:89% align:start
Maki.

00:32:29.651 --> 00:32:30.552 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:32:30.685 --> 00:32:32.620 position:27% line:89% align:start
You have a shot.

00:32:32.754 --> 00:32:35.088 position:27% line:89% align:start
Shot, shot, shot.

00:32:36.423 --> 00:32:37.759 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Maki] What crazy
ideas are you getting

00:32:37.892 --> 00:32:38.760 position:19% line:89% align:start
in that head of yours?

00:32:38.893 --> 00:32:40.194 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Panda] Don't be so shy.

00:32:40.327 --> 00:32:42.095 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's not like you're
in elementary school.

00:32:42.229 --> 00:32:43.430 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Maki] Oh, that's it.

00:32:43.565 --> 00:32:45.065 position:21% line:83% align:start
-I'm gonna kill you.
-(Yuta giggles)

00:32:45.199 --> 00:32:45.999 position:10% line:83% align:start
-What're they fighting about?
-[Panda] Ow, ow.

00:32:46.133 --> 00:32:47.334 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Kelp.

00:32:48.636 --> 00:32:51.606 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Yuta giggles)

00:32:51.739 --> 00:32:55.342 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Yuta] I still don't understand
anything Inumaki says.

00:32:55.476 --> 00:32:57.946 position:27% line:83% align:start
Which makes me a
little scared of him.

00:32:58.078 --> 00:32:58.947 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Gojo claps)

00:32:59.079 --> 00:33:01.783 position:24% line:89% align:start
Okay, gather round.

00:33:01.916 --> 00:33:05.653 position:10% line:83% align:start
You two continue training or
whatever it is you're doing.

00:33:06.588 --> 00:33:08.590 position:27% line:83% align:start
Toge, you've been
requested for a curse

00:33:08.723 --> 00:33:09.958 position:16% line:89% align:start
that you're perfect for.

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:11.726 position:24% line:83% align:start
Shouldn't take you
long to exorcize it.

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:12.727 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Salmon.

00:33:12.861 --> 00:33:14.394 position:35% line:89% align:start
Requested?

00:33:14.529 --> 00:33:16.598 position:13% line:83% align:start
Toge is the only grade-two
sorcerer among us first-years.

00:33:16.731 --> 00:33:19.366 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's allowed to take on
missions all on his own.

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:20.702 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Panda and Maki grunts)

00:33:20.835 --> 00:33:22.035 position:19% line:89% align:start
Wow, that's impressive.

00:33:22.169 --> 00:33:23.270 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Maki] Your
special-grade's higher.

00:33:23.403 --> 00:33:25.138 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yuta, why don't
you go along too.

00:33:25.272 --> 00:33:26.808 position:16% line:89% align:start
You'll be Toge's support.

00:33:26.941 --> 00:33:27.876 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:33:28.008 --> 00:33:29.476 position:13% line:89% align:start
You want me to support him?

00:33:29.611 --> 00:33:32.312 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Satoru] Well, you'll be more
like an observer, really.

00:33:32.446 --> 00:33:34.481 position:30% line:83% align:start
There's a wide
variety of jujutsu,

00:33:34.616 --> 00:33:36.450 position:27% line:83% align:start
so you can assume
there are as many ways

00:33:36.584 --> 00:33:39.386 position:19% line:83% align:start
to exorcize a curse as
there are sorcerers.

00:33:39.521 --> 00:33:42.155 position:16% line:83% align:start
Toge's cursed speech is a
good example of one way.

00:33:42.289 --> 00:33:43.758 position:10% line:89% align:start
Make sure to learn from him.

00:33:43.892 --> 00:33:45.392 position:30% line:89% align:start
Cursed speech?

00:33:45.527 --> 00:33:48.161 position:13% line:83% align:start
As the term suggests, it's
imbuing speech with curses.

00:33:48.295 --> 00:33:50.865 position:21% line:83% align:start
Eh, it'll make sense
once you see it.

00:33:50.999 --> 00:33:54.536 position:13% line:83% align:start
To break a curse, you must
first understand curses.

00:33:55.904 --> 00:33:57.772 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] My first real mission.

00:33:57.906 --> 00:33:59.874 position:21% line:89% align:start
No, wait, my second.

00:34:00.008 --> 00:34:02.175 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, I'm still so nervous.

00:34:03.678 --> 00:34:04.679 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Salmon.

00:34:04.812 --> 00:34:06.113 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

00:34:06.246 --> 00:34:07.114 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh, I.

00:34:07.247 --> 00:34:08.115 position:27% line:89% align:start
You startled me.

00:34:08.248 --> 00:34:09.449 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sorry.

00:34:10.217 --> 00:34:12.687 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yuta, one more thing.

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:13.755 position:41% line:89% align:start
Coming.

00:34:13.888 --> 00:34:15.289 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sorry, but I don't have the time

00:34:15.422 --> 00:34:16.991 position:13% line:89% align:start
to supervise this mission.

00:34:17.124 --> 00:34:20.562 position:10% line:83% align:start
But this job is typically one
Toge could handle by himself.

00:34:20.695 --> 00:34:21.996 position:27% line:89% align:start
So you can relax.

00:34:22.129 --> 00:34:24.732 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's only one thing that
you need to be careful of.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.535 position:24% line:89% align:start
Don't let Rika out.

00:34:28.836 --> 00:34:30.705 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's no guarantee
she'll go back in,

00:34:30.838 --> 00:34:32.205 position:19% line:89% align:start
like she did last time.

00:34:32.339 --> 00:34:34.042 position:21% line:83% align:start
Only use the portion
of Rika's power

00:34:34.174 --> 00:34:36.076 position:24% line:83% align:start
that you can imbue
in your sword.

00:34:37.545 --> 00:34:40.882 position:10% line:83% align:start
Do you know what will happen
if you let her out again?

00:34:41.015 --> 00:34:41.916 position:27% line:89% align:start
No, what happens?

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:44.719 position:19% line:89% align:start
Bluh, both you and me.

00:34:44.852 --> 00:34:46.386 position:21% line:89% align:start
Dead as a door nail.

00:34:46.521 --> 00:34:47.722 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm counting on you.

00:34:47.855 --> 00:34:49.958 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:53.160 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Yuta] Why does he have to
bring that up right now?

00:34:59.033 --> 00:35:01.569 position:35% line:89% align:start
(crows caw)

00:35:04.539 --> 00:35:07.842 position:21% line:89% align:start
(car engine revving)

00:35:10.745 --> 00:35:11.746 position:30% line:89% align:start
We've arrived.

00:35:13.815 --> 00:35:15.349 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hapina Shopping District.

00:35:15.482 --> 00:35:18.620 position:13% line:83% align:start
At the moment, most of the
stores are closed to the public.

00:35:19.687 --> 00:35:22.824 position:7% line:83% align:start
"There's a project to demolish
the Hapina Shopping District

00:35:22.957 --> 00:35:24.592 position:7% line:89% align:start
in order to put up a new mall.

00:35:24.726 --> 00:35:26.561 position:21% line:83% align:start
During an inspection
of the area,

00:35:26.694 --> 00:35:28.796 position:24% line:83% align:start
we confirmed a pack
of low-level curses

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:30.798 position:13% line:89% align:start
hiding among the corridors.

00:35:32.066 --> 00:35:33.333 position:13% line:89% align:start
In order to exorcize them,

00:35:33.467 --> 00:35:36.203 position:21% line:83% align:start
we request, grade-two
sorcerer, Toge."

00:35:36.336 --> 00:35:37.672 position:35% line:89% align:start
Huh, wait.

00:35:37.805 --> 00:35:39.339 position:24% line:89% align:start
Where did Toge go?

00:35:39.473 --> 00:35:40.407 position:24% line:89% align:start
He was right here.

00:35:40.541 --> 00:35:41.809 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Man] Thank you, come again.

00:35:41.943 --> 00:35:44.277 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, Mr. Ijichi, over there.

00:35:46.246 --> 00:35:48.049 position:27% line:89% align:start
He was shopping?

00:35:48.181 --> 00:35:49.917 position:5% line:89% align:start
What did you buy in that store?

00:35:52.687 --> 00:35:53.821 position:27% line:89% align:start
Throat medicine?

00:35:54.889 --> 00:35:56.189 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Ijichi sighs)

00:35:56.323 --> 00:35:57.959 position:24% line:83% align:start
In short, they want
us to exorcize it now

00:35:58.092 --> 00:36:00.662 position:13% line:83% align:start
before the building they're
spending so much money on

00:36:00.795 --> 00:36:03.163 position:21% line:83% align:start
develops a reputation
for cursed energy.

00:36:03.296 --> 00:36:04.699 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Salmon.

00:36:04.832 --> 00:36:05.867 position:38% line:89% align:start
Now then.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.401 position:21% line:89% align:start
I will draw the veil.

00:36:08.368 --> 00:36:09.570 position:27% line:89% align:start
Good luck to you.

00:36:14.642 --> 00:36:17.879 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Yuta breathes deeply)

00:36:20.715 --> 00:36:23.985 position:19% line:83% align:start
He said, it was a pack
of low-level curses.

00:36:24.118 --> 00:36:25.419 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Pollack roe.

00:36:25.553 --> 00:36:28.756 position:24% line:89% align:start
(footsteps tapping)

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:45.006 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Fish Curse] That's
not fair, Mama.

00:36:45.139 --> 00:36:47.909 position:5% line:89% align:start
My brother got more than I did.

00:36:48.042 --> 00:36:49.309 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Fish Curse] So what?

00:36:49.443 --> 00:36:51.179 position:16% line:83% align:start
Let's trade doubles that
way we both get one.

00:36:51.311 --> 00:36:54.782 position:19% line:89% align:start
(fish curse chattering)

00:36:58.653 --> 00:37:00.722 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Fish Curse] Is
the cheapest stuff.

00:37:01.656 --> 00:37:03.290 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Maki] The weaker curses are,

00:37:03.423 --> 00:37:05.026 position:10% line:89% align:start
the more they group together.

00:37:05.159 --> 00:37:06.694 position:27% line:89% align:start
Look at them all.

00:37:06.828 --> 00:37:08.930 position:21% line:83% align:start
Weak or not, there's
just too many.

00:37:14.068 --> 00:37:15.268 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:37:15.402 --> 00:37:16.604 position:38% line:89% align:start
Inumaki?

00:37:17.205 --> 00:37:18.072 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's dangerous.

00:37:18.206 --> 00:37:19.807 position:21% line:89% align:start
Don't get too close.

00:37:19.941 --> 00:37:20.942 position:38% line:89% align:start
Explode.

00:37:23.578 --> 00:37:26.614 position:27% line:89% align:start
(explosion booms)

00:37:28.116 --> 00:37:29.249 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, wow.

00:37:29.382 --> 00:37:31.886 position:16% line:89% align:start
So this is cursed speech?

00:37:32.019 --> 00:37:32.887 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:34.856 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, it's over already?

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:37.058 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Tuna mayo.

00:37:37.191 --> 00:37:38.059 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

00:37:38.192 --> 00:37:39.392 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] His voice.

00:37:40.194 --> 00:37:41.294 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wait.

00:37:41.428 --> 00:37:43.430 position:27% line:83% align:start
That explains the
throat medicine.

00:37:44.832 --> 00:37:47.201 position:24% line:83% align:start
What an incredible
amount of power.

00:37:47.334 --> 00:37:50.605 position:13% line:83% align:start
But I'm sure it comes with
a great deal of risk, too.

00:37:53.074 --> 00:37:54.341 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Bonito flakes.

00:37:54.474 --> 00:37:55.710 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is something wrong?

00:37:56.644 --> 00:37:59.881 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, yeah, the veil
isn't lifting.

00:38:00.014 --> 00:38:02.750 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hmm, I can't get through.

00:38:02.884 --> 00:38:05.418 position:30% line:83% align:start
Does this mean,
there's no way out?

00:38:05.553 --> 00:38:06.419 position:30% line:89% align:start
(air whooshes)

00:38:06.554 --> 00:38:10.024 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Toge and Yuta groans)

00:38:13.027 --> 00:38:14.294 position:24% line:89% align:start
What is this curse?

00:38:14.427 --> 00:38:17.098 position:16% line:83% align:start
Its presence is different
from the others.

00:38:17.231 --> 00:38:18.766 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Zomba] Zomba.

00:38:19.867 --> 00:38:20.735 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

00:38:20.868 --> 00:38:21.969 position:27% line:89% align:start
(explosion booms)

00:38:22.103 --> 00:38:23.303 position:38% line:89% align:start
Inumaki.

00:38:24.772 --> 00:38:25.773 position:41% line:89% align:start
Twist.

00:38:28.576 --> 00:38:30.878 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Toge groans)

00:38:31.012 --> 00:38:33.514 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Toge coughs)

00:38:35.116 --> 00:38:37.285 position:27% line:89% align:start
(ground rumbles)

00:38:37.417 --> 00:38:39.554 position:5% line:89% align:start
What in the world is that thing?

00:38:39.687 --> 00:38:42.890 position:24% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

00:38:46.527 --> 00:38:48.629 position:21% line:83% align:start
They said the curses
were low-level,

00:38:48.763 --> 00:38:50.665 position:13% line:89% align:start
but that thing is enormous.

00:38:50.798 --> 00:38:52.499 position:10% line:89% align:start
This isn't what we were told.

00:38:53.835 --> 00:38:55.670 position:21% line:83% align:start
That thing is scarier
than the big guys

00:38:55.803 --> 00:38:57.839 position:13% line:89% align:start
from the elementary school.

00:38:57.972 --> 00:38:58.973 position:33% line:89% align:start
Way scarier.

00:38:59.106 --> 00:39:00.641 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Toge grunts)

00:39:00.775 --> 00:39:02.310 position:21% line:89% align:start
Inumaki, you're hurt.

00:39:02.442 --> 00:39:03.845 position:21% line:89% align:start
Where did it get you?

00:39:04.444 --> 00:39:05.313 position:44% line:89% align:start
Whoa.

00:39:05.445 --> 00:39:06.379 position:38% line:89% align:start
Twisted.

00:39:06.514 --> 00:39:07.882 position:41% line:89% align:start
Salmon.

00:39:08.015 --> 00:39:09.217 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:11.719 position:19% line:83% align:start
You shouldn't mess with
it, it might get worse.

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:13.386 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:39:14.021 --> 00:39:15.556 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's all my fault.

00:39:23.998 --> 00:39:26.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
It doesn't seem to be
looking for us at all.

00:39:28.336 --> 00:39:30.805 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll contact Mr. Ijichi.

00:39:30.938 --> 00:39:31.606 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:39:31.739 --> 00:39:33.074 position:30% line:89% align:start
Out of service?

00:39:33.207 --> 00:39:34.575 position:30% line:89% align:start
That can't be.

00:39:34.709 --> 00:39:36.077 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Bonito flakes.

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:37.078 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:39:37.211 --> 00:39:38.613 position:21% line:89% align:start
Because of the veil?

00:39:40.948 --> 00:39:44.118 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, if the veil won't
lift, we have to exorcize it.

00:39:44.252 --> 00:39:45.452 position:27% line:89% align:start
Isn't that right?

00:39:50.124 --> 00:39:51.125 position:38% line:89% align:start
Inumaki?

00:39:51.859 --> 00:39:53.895 position:27% line:83% align:start
You shouldn't be
moving around already.

00:39:55.963 --> 00:39:57.064 position:41% line:89% align:start
Salmon.

00:39:57.198 --> 00:39:58.199 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Toge coughs)

00:39:58.332 --> 00:39:59.533 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:40:00.835 --> 00:40:03.170 position:19% line:83% align:start
You want to fight this
battle by yourself?

00:40:28.162 --> 00:40:29.997 position:27% line:89% align:start
Thanks, Inumaki.

00:40:30.131 --> 00:40:31.132 position:44% line:89% align:start
But,

00:40:33.701 --> 00:40:35.503 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm going to come with you.

00:40:40.141 --> 00:40:42.143 position:24% line:89% align:start
(footsteps tapping)

00:40:42.276 --> 00:40:43.476 position:19% line:89% align:start
We'll both do our best.

00:40:43.611 --> 00:40:44.979 position:38% line:89% align:start
Let's go.

00:40:45.112 --> 00:40:48.082 position:24% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

00:40:54.088 --> 00:40:56.590 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Zomba growls)

00:40:57.425 --> 00:41:00.127 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Rika] Go get him, Yuta.

00:41:00.261 --> 00:41:02.763 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Zomba growl)

00:41:04.932 --> 00:41:06.834 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hey, what's it mad at me for?

00:41:06.968 --> 00:41:09.804 position:10% line:89% align:start
Like it wasn't scary enough.

00:41:09.937 --> 00:41:10.938 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:41:12.406 --> 00:41:15.643 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Yuta breathes deeply)

00:41:15.776 --> 00:41:17.511 position:10% line:89% align:start
Don't take your eyes off him.

00:41:17.645 --> 00:41:19.447 position:24% line:89% align:start
Don't stop moving.

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:21.949 position:5% line:89% align:start
Imbue the curse into the katana.

00:41:26.287 --> 00:41:28.022 position:27% line:89% align:start
(sword clanging)

00:41:28.155 --> 00:41:31.192 position:27% line:89% align:start
(explosion booms)

00:41:34.595 --> 00:41:36.330 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta grunts)

00:41:36.464 --> 00:41:39.100 position:27% line:89% align:start
(explosion booms)

00:41:39.233 --> 00:41:41.802 position:30% line:83% align:start
Inumaki has an
incredibly kind heart.

00:41:41.936 --> 00:41:43.938 position:24% line:83% align:start
He doesn't want to
accidentally curse others,

00:41:44.071 --> 00:41:46.474 position:21% line:83% align:start
so he speaks in rice
ball ingredients,

00:41:46.607 --> 00:41:48.976 position:7% line:89% align:start
words that can't carry curses.

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:50.978 position:10% line:89% align:start
Even today, he helped me out.

00:41:51.112 --> 00:41:53.114 position:24% line:83% align:start
He tried to keep me
away from danger.

00:41:54.415 --> 00:41:56.717 position:24% line:83% align:start
Earlier, when I was
totally freaking out,

00:41:56.851 --> 00:41:59.220 position:21% line:83% align:start
he was trying to make
me feel comfortable.

00:42:01.222 --> 00:42:04.258 position:27% line:89% align:start
(explosion booms)

00:42:06.327 --> 00:42:07.161 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Zomba groans)

00:42:07.294 --> 00:42:09.063 position:27% line:89% align:start
(sword whooshing)

00:42:09.196 --> 00:42:10.498 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Zomba groans)

00:42:10.631 --> 00:42:12.199 position:21% line:89% align:start
A superficial wound.

00:42:12.333 --> 00:42:13.701 position:27% line:89% align:start
Boy, he's tough.

00:42:13.834 --> 00:42:15.903 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(explosion booms)
-(Yuta grunts)

00:42:16.037 --> 00:42:19.240 position:13% line:83% align:start
Okay, maybe I can't compete
with this curse but Inumaki can.

00:42:21.375 --> 00:42:24.078 position:24% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

00:42:24.211 --> 00:42:25.346 position:30% line:89% align:start
Inumaki, catch.

00:42:25.479 --> 00:42:27.081 position:13% line:89% align:start
(throat medicine whooshes)

00:42:27.214 --> 00:42:30.851 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm not gonna let Inumaki
kindness go to waste.

00:42:31.585 --> 00:42:32.853 position:35% line:89% align:start
Nice catch.

00:42:37.691 --> 00:42:38.559 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Toge gulps)

00:42:38.692 --> 00:42:39.693 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Zomba groans)

00:42:39.827 --> 00:42:42.596 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:42:44.265 --> 00:42:47.268 position:27% line:89% align:start
(explosion booms)

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:50.905 position:33% line:89% align:start
Get crushed.

00:42:54.208 --> 00:42:56.877 position:27% line:89% align:start
(blood splashes)

00:42:58.379 --> 00:42:59.480 position:35% line:89% align:start
Incredible.

00:42:59.613 --> 00:43:00.915 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Mustard leaf.

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:04.585 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] Oh, I'm fine.

00:43:04.718 --> 00:43:05.920 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's only a scratch.

00:43:09.156 --> 00:43:10.157 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Salmon.

00:43:12.561 --> 00:43:14.795 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, good work.

00:43:18.432 --> 00:43:20.201 position:13% line:89% align:start
Once I break Rika's curse,

00:43:20.334 --> 00:43:22.736 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna be a
normal person again.

00:43:23.737 --> 00:43:26.407 position:16% line:83% align:start
I won't be able to stay
at Jujutsu High anymore,

00:43:26.541 --> 00:43:30.244 position:13% line:83% align:start
but until then, I'm gonna
try to help as many people

00:43:30.377 --> 00:43:31.378 position:38% line:89% align:start
as I can.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.215 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

00:43:34.348 --> 00:43:36.317 position:30% line:83% align:start
We still can't
get out, can't we?

00:43:37.451 --> 00:43:38.886 position:33% line:89% align:start
What a shame.

00:43:39.019 --> 00:43:42.256 position:13% line:83% align:start
I came here just to see the
rumored curse named Rika.

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:46.961 position:16% line:83% align:start
As a special-grade, I was
hoping to meet her soon.

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:52.099 position:21% line:83% align:start
Perhaps, I should go
return this to him.

00:44:00.207 --> 00:44:02.977 position:7% line:83% align:start
Toge's been able to use cursed
speech since he was born.

00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:05.412 position:19% line:83% align:start
You can imagine when he
was just a little boy,

00:44:05.547 --> 00:44:08.617 position:10% line:83% align:start
he struggled quite a bit with
his new cursed speech power.

00:44:08.749 --> 00:44:10.985 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sometimes he accidentally
cursed people

00:44:11.118 --> 00:44:12.486 position:19% line:89% align:start
that he didn't mean to.

00:44:12.621 --> 00:44:16.090 position:13% line:83% align:start
In fact, his situation was
pretty similar to yours.

00:44:16.223 --> 00:44:17.825 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's why he's been
worried about you

00:44:17.958 --> 00:44:20.361 position:19% line:83% align:start
ever since the day you
transferred in here.

00:44:21.495 --> 00:44:25.166 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's easy to misunderstand
him, but he's a good guy.

00:44:25.866 --> 00:44:28.936 position:21% line:83% align:start
Try to be as kind to
him as he is to you.

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:30.337 position:35% line:89% align:start
Mm, I will.

00:44:30.471 --> 00:44:31.540 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta grunts)

00:44:31.672 --> 00:44:32.773 position:27% line:83% align:start
Time to start our
morning training.

00:44:32.907 --> 00:44:33.974 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(Panda giggles)
-Okay, I'm coming.

00:44:34.108 --> 00:44:35.809 position:5% line:89% align:start
Panda, what are you laughing at?

00:44:35.943 --> 00:44:37.178 position:27% line:89% align:start
Something funny?

00:44:37.311 --> 00:44:38.279 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Panda] Well,

00:44:38.412 --> 00:44:40.314 position:27% line:83% align:start
-not really, but.
-Hey, Maki, hold on.

00:44:40.447 --> 00:44:41.682 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:44:41.815 --> 00:44:43.518 position:24% line:83% align:start
Are there any cool
tricks you can teach me?

00:44:43.652 --> 00:44:46.887 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'd like to imbue my curse
into my katana more smoothly.

00:44:47.021 --> 00:44:48.155 position:30% line:89% align:start
Just forget it.

00:44:48.289 --> 00:44:50.291 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't ask me about
cursed energy.

00:44:54.161 --> 00:44:55.162 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:44:57.431 --> 00:45:00.467 position:10% line:83% align:start
After scouring every inch of
the Hapina Shopping District,

00:45:00.602 --> 00:45:03.170 position:19% line:83% align:start
I found three different
types of residuals.

00:45:03.304 --> 00:45:04.838 position:24% line:83% align:start
Mr. Ijichi doesn't
think it's likely

00:45:04.972 --> 00:45:06.675 position:24% line:83% align:start
we're going to find
anything more than that

00:45:06.807 --> 00:45:07.676 position:24% line:89% align:start
if we keep looking.

00:45:07.808 --> 00:45:09.376 position:21% line:89% align:start
Okay, got it, thanks.

00:45:09.511 --> 00:45:10.579 position:27% line:89% align:start
Excellent report.

00:45:10.711 --> 00:45:11.912 position:38% line:89% align:start
You bet.

00:45:16.016 --> 00:45:18.886 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Satoru sniffs)

00:45:22.089 --> 00:45:25.292 position:24% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

00:45:27.662 --> 00:45:30.864 position:24% line:89% align:start
(footsteps tapping)

00:45:43.477 --> 00:45:44.478 position:21% line:89% align:start
Sorry to bother you.

00:45:45.246 --> 00:45:48.382 position:13% line:83% align:start
Our inspection showed, that
someone lowered a second veil

00:45:48.516 --> 00:45:49.718 position:27% line:89% align:start
on top of my own.

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:51.118 position:19% line:89% align:start
We don't know who yet,

00:45:51.252 --> 00:45:53.287 position:21% line:83% align:start
but we're analyzing
the residual energy.

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:54.689 position:33% line:89% align:start
In addition,

00:45:54.822 --> 00:45:57.525 position:10% line:83% align:start
a semi-first-grade curse made
an unexpected appearance.

00:45:58.826 --> 00:46:01.895 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's my fault for not being
as thorough as I should have.

00:46:02.029 --> 00:46:03.397 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'll accept any punishment.

00:46:03.531 --> 00:46:04.599 position:27% line:89% align:start
No, you're fine.

00:46:04.733 --> 00:46:06.767 position:16% line:89% align:start
You were just outclassed.

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:08.802 position:24% line:89% align:start
Outclassed by who?

00:46:08.936 --> 00:46:11.438 position:24% line:83% align:start
Do you have an idea
about who did it?

00:46:11.573 --> 00:46:14.775 position:24% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:28.289 position:33% line:89% align:start
Suguru Geto.

00:46:30.424 --> 00:46:33.160 position:30% line:83% align:start
A special-grade
jujutsu sorcerer.

00:46:33.294 --> 00:46:35.896 position:24% line:83% align:start
One of four who was
banished from Jujutsu High.

00:46:36.531 --> 00:46:39.933 position:16% line:83% align:start
He cursed over a hundred
normal people to death.

00:46:40.067 --> 00:46:41.468 position:13% line:89% align:start
The worst curse user ever.

00:46:55.316 --> 00:46:57.585 position:24% line:83% align:start
Mom, I'll be fine,
let's go home.

00:46:57.719 --> 00:47:00.354 position:16% line:83% align:start
We're already here, let's
just wait a little longer

00:47:00.487 --> 00:47:01.889 position:24% line:89% align:start
so we can meet him.

00:47:02.022 --> 00:47:02.923 position:38% line:89% align:start
But, Mom.

00:47:03.057 --> 00:47:03.891 position:30% line:89% align:start
(door whooshes)

00:47:04.024 --> 00:47:06.528 position:33% line:89% align:start
(both groans)

00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:19.940 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hello, Ladies.

00:47:20.074 --> 00:47:22.510 position:10% line:83% align:start
As I understand it, you said
your daughter was being haunted

00:47:22.644 --> 00:47:23.977 position:35% line:89% align:start
by a ghost.

00:47:24.111 --> 00:47:26.347 position:10% line:89% align:start
Isn't that right, Mrs. Sato?

00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:30.752 position:24% line:83% align:start
Ah, yeah, but it's
Saito, actually.

00:47:30.884 --> 00:47:33.153 position:13% line:89% align:start
No, your name is Mrs. Sato.

00:47:33.287 --> 00:47:36.423 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've decided Sato is a
better name than Saito.

00:47:37.525 --> 00:47:39.193 position:33% line:89% align:start
(mom groans)

00:47:39.326 --> 00:47:41.195 position:10% line:89% align:start
Come on, mom, let's just go.

00:47:41.328 --> 00:47:43.897 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sweetheart, let's get
this problem taken care of

00:47:44.031 --> 00:47:45.165 position:27% line:89% align:start
once and for all.

00:47:45.299 --> 00:47:46.668 position:27% line:83% align:start
This whole thing
seems shady, though.

00:47:46.801 --> 00:47:49.903 position:21% line:83% align:start
You constantly feel a
piercing gaze upon you.

00:47:51.038 --> 00:47:52.473 position:30% line:83% align:start
Sometimes your
shoulders feel heavy,

00:47:52.607 --> 00:47:55.175 position:30% line:83% align:start
and it becomes
difficult to breathe.

00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:57.512 position:24% line:83% align:start
Almost as if you've
forgotten how.

00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:02.517 position:16% line:83% align:start
And you often dream that
you're being assaulted.

00:48:04.318 --> 00:48:05.553 position:19% line:89% align:start
How did you know that?

00:48:07.756 --> 00:48:09.390 position:27% line:89% align:start
Try not to move.

00:48:09.524 --> 00:48:12.226 position:27% line:89% align:start
(monster groans)

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.403 position:33% line:89% align:start
Wait, no way.

00:48:22.537 --> 00:48:23.571 position:27% line:89% align:start
It feels better.

00:48:26.473 --> 00:48:29.677 position:13% line:83% align:start
Honestly, I don't know how
we could ever repay you.

00:48:30.779 --> 00:48:32.079 position:33% line:89% align:start
Don't worry.

00:48:32.212 --> 00:48:34.114 position:24% line:83% align:start
We should all help
those in times of need.

00:48:34.248 --> 00:48:36.785 position:27% line:83% align:start
Come on by if you
have any more trouble.

00:48:36.917 --> 00:48:38.085 position:30% line:89% align:start
(both giggles)

00:48:38.218 --> 00:48:39.521 position:24% line:89% align:start
See, I told you so.

00:48:39.654 --> 00:48:41.989 position:19% line:83% align:start
What this man has done
for you is simply godly.

00:48:42.122 --> 00:48:43.323 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:48:43.858 --> 00:48:45.325 position:35% line:89% align:start
Godly, huh?

00:48:45.459 --> 00:48:48.395 position:24% line:83% align:start
That Mrs. Sato is a
smart one, isn't she?

00:48:49.296 --> 00:48:51.999 position:27% line:83% align:start
Filthy monkey who
can't even use jujutsu.

00:48:52.132 --> 00:48:54.468 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your true feelings seem
to be showing, Geto.

00:48:54.602 --> 00:48:56.604 position:24% line:83% align:start
The leaders are all
waiting for you.

00:48:56.738 --> 00:48:58.138 position:10% line:89% align:start
They're in the meeting room.

00:48:59.306 --> 00:49:01.676 position:16% line:83% align:start
What is that stuff you're
spraying everywhere?

00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:03.444 position:19% line:89% align:start
Disinfecting deodorant.

00:49:03.578 --> 00:49:06.614 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't want everyone to
breathe in the monkey smell.

00:49:07.882 --> 00:49:09.584 position:27% line:89% align:start
What a great day.

00:49:09.717 --> 00:49:10.819 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm so happy.

00:49:10.951 --> 00:49:12.554 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's been so long
since we all met.

00:49:12.687 --> 00:49:14.656 position:27% line:83% align:start
I know, since all
the leaders are here,

00:49:14.789 --> 00:49:16.190 position:10% line:89% align:start
let's take a photo together.

00:49:16.323 --> 00:49:17.191 position:24% line:89% align:start
Where's my camera?

00:49:17.324 --> 00:49:18.526 position:24% line:89% align:start
Got it right here.

00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:20.929 position:16% line:83% align:start
-(camera shutter clicks)
-(Suda giggles)

00:49:21.061 --> 00:49:22.029 position:44% line:89% align:start
Geto.

00:49:22.162 --> 00:49:24.566 position:10% line:89% align:start
I want to see Geto right now.

00:49:24.699 --> 00:49:25.499 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Kanamori groans)

00:49:25.633 --> 00:49:27.100 position:30% line:89% align:start
Geto, damn you.

00:49:27.234 --> 00:49:28.101 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Kanamori groans)

00:49:28.235 --> 00:49:29.571 position:16% line:89% align:start
If it isn't Mr. Kanamori.

00:49:29.704 --> 00:49:32.105 position:21% line:83% align:start
What brings you here
in such a sweaty panic?

00:49:32.239 --> 00:49:35.275 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't play dumb, hurry
up and exorcize my curse.

00:49:35.409 --> 00:49:37.946 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do you know how much
I've paid you already?

00:49:38.078 --> 00:49:38.947 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Kanamori grunts)

00:49:39.079 --> 00:49:40.047 position:38% line:89% align:start
How much?

00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:42.216 position:7% line:89% align:start
Approximately 105 million yen.

00:49:42.349 --> 00:49:45.385 position:21% line:83% align:start
However, no donations
for the past six months.

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:47.655 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Suguru] I guess
that's it for you then.

00:49:47.789 --> 00:49:48.656 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wait a minute.

00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:51.626 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Kanamori groans)

00:49:52.794 --> 00:49:54.027 position:13% line:89% align:start
There are lots of monkeys,

00:49:54.161 --> 00:49:56.463 position:27% line:83% align:start
and they all have
their own role to play.

00:49:56.598 --> 00:49:58.700 position:38% line:83% align:start
There are
money-collecting monkeys

00:49:58.833 --> 00:50:00.969 position:10% line:89% align:start
and curse-collecting monkeys.

00:50:01.101 --> 00:50:02.837 position:10% line:89% align:start
You happen to be the former.

00:50:02.971 --> 00:50:06.240 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you're out of money, I
have no further use for you.

00:50:07.307 --> 00:50:08.175 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Suguru gulps)

00:50:08.308 --> 00:50:09.176 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Suguru snaps)

00:50:09.309 --> 00:50:11.011 position:30% line:89% align:start
Screw you then.

00:50:11.144 --> 00:50:14.481 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Monster] Suck, suck,
suck, suck, suck.

00:50:14.616 --> 00:50:17.417 position:10% line:89% align:start
Suck, suck, suck, suck, suck.

00:50:18.786 --> 00:50:20.822 position:27% line:89% align:start
Suck, suck, suck.

00:50:20.955 --> 00:50:23.691 position:27% line:89% align:start
(blood splashes)

00:50:25.827 --> 00:50:27.194 position:24% line:89% align:start
Totally disgusting.

00:50:27.327 --> 00:50:29.931 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't believe he's
part of the same species.

00:50:30.063 --> 00:50:31.633 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now you know why
I'm always saying

00:50:31.766 --> 00:50:33.801 position:33% line:83% align:start
that they're
nothing but monkeys.

00:50:34.636 --> 00:50:37.437 position:24% line:83% align:start
The time is here,
my beloved family.

00:50:37.572 --> 00:50:39.641 position:19% line:83% align:start
Let's lower the curtain
on the age of monkeys,

00:50:39.774 --> 00:50:43.545 position:21% line:83% align:start
and build a paradise
for jujutsu sorcerers.

00:50:43.678 --> 00:50:46.179 position:21% line:83% align:start
First though, we must
destroy the cornerstone

00:50:46.313 --> 00:50:49.684 position:21% line:83% align:start
of the jujutsu world,
Jujutsu High School.

00:50:51.819 --> 00:50:52.854 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

00:50:52.987 --> 00:50:54.656 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Panda] What's wrong, Yuta?

00:50:54.789 --> 00:50:55.990 position:44% line:89% align:start
Well.

00:50:56.123 --> 00:50:57.859 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think I just had
a bad premonition.

00:50:57.992 --> 00:51:00.127 position:16% line:83% align:start
-You're imagining things.
-Yep, he's imagining things.

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:01.729 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Bonito flakes.

00:51:01.863 --> 00:51:02.864 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

00:51:02.997 --> 00:51:04.364 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] Guys, wait up.

00:51:04.498 --> 00:51:05.800 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Panda] I hate to
tell you, Yuta,

00:51:05.934 --> 00:51:08.201 position:16% line:83% align:start
but your ability to sense
cursed energy sucks.

00:51:08.335 --> 00:51:09.469 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Maki] I figured it's dulled,

00:51:09.604 --> 00:51:10.905 position:24% line:83% align:start
with something like
Rika inside you.

00:51:11.039 --> 00:51:12.239 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Tuna.

00:51:13.641 --> 00:51:16.476 position:13% line:83% align:start
We still aren't picking up
on any actions from Geto.

00:51:16.611 --> 00:51:19.547 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are you sure you're not
worrying over him for nothing?

00:51:19.681 --> 00:51:22.684 position:16% line:83% align:start
Principal, it pains me to
tell you that's not possible.

00:51:22.817 --> 00:51:25.587 position:30% line:83% align:start
I confirmed it
myself on the scene.

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:27.487 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's no way I would
mistake the residuals

00:51:27.622 --> 00:51:30.257 position:5% line:89% align:start
of Suguru Geto's cursed energy.

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:32.727 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hmm, Suguru.

00:51:34.261 --> 00:51:35.429 position:33% line:89% align:start
God damn it.

00:51:35.563 --> 00:51:37.497 position:7% line:89% align:start
Speaking of that little devil.

00:51:37.632 --> 00:51:41.002 position:7% line:83% align:start
Gather all sorcerers on campus,
semi-first-grade and above.

00:51:41.134 --> 00:51:42.870 position:27% line:83% align:start
In the circle out
front, right now.

00:51:44.038 --> 00:51:45.405 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's unusual.

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:47.709 position:27% line:83% align:start
I guess Yuta was
right, after all.

00:51:47.842 --> 00:51:48.710 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Salmon.

00:51:48.843 --> 00:51:49.811 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:51:50.277 --> 00:51:53.180 position:27% line:89% align:start
(wings whooshes)

00:51:57.585 --> 00:52:00.722 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sorry bird brain but
you're in the wrong nest.

00:52:00.855 --> 00:52:02.657 position:30% line:83% align:start
I haven't seen
that curse before.

00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:03.825 position:35% line:89% align:start
Salmon roe.

00:52:03.958 --> 00:52:06.426 position:10% line:89% align:start
Wow, that's a real big bird.

00:52:06.561 --> 00:52:09.097 position:27% line:83% align:start
This place never
does change, does it.

00:52:09.229 --> 00:52:10.397 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yuck.

00:52:10.531 --> 00:52:11.933 position:27% line:83% align:start
Mr. Geto, please
don't tell me this is

00:52:12.066 --> 00:52:13.166 position:19% line:89% align:start
what Tokyo looks like?

00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:15.103 position:27% line:83% align:start
Feels like we're
out in the sticks.

00:52:15.235 --> 00:52:16.938 position:21% line:89% align:start
Nanako, that's rude.

00:52:17.071 --> 00:52:18.171 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:52:18.305 --> 00:52:19.641 position:24% line:83% align:start
You know you think
so, too, Mimiko.

00:52:19.774 --> 00:52:22.110 position:27% line:83% align:start
Come on, get out
of there already.

00:52:22.242 --> 00:52:23.778 position:5% line:89% align:start
Aren't you cold without a shirt?

00:52:23.911 --> 00:52:25.145 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, who are those guys?

00:52:25.278 --> 00:52:27.048 position:24% line:89% align:start
Whoa, it's a panda.

00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:28.116 position:38% line:89% align:start
How cute.

00:52:28.248 --> 00:52:29.684 position:5% line:89% align:start
And who are you supposed to be?

00:52:29.817 --> 00:52:32.452 position:13% line:83% align:start
Get off the school grounds
before Yuta makes you.

00:52:32.587 --> 00:52:34.354 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Pollack roe.
-Huh?

00:52:34.488 --> 00:52:37.491 position:16% line:83% align:start
Better go home before you
get beat up, by Yuta, I mean.

00:52:37.625 --> 00:52:38.593 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:52:39.594 --> 00:52:41.829 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Suguru] Nice to meet
you, Yuta Okkotsu.

00:52:41.963 --> 00:52:43.598 position:19% line:89% align:start
My name is Suguru Geto.

00:52:43.731 --> 00:52:45.499 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Maki And Panda] He's fast.

00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:46.968 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hi.

00:52:47.101 --> 00:52:48.603 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's nice to meet you.

00:52:48.736 --> 00:52:51.673 position:13% line:83% align:start
I see you're in possession
of a truly wonderful power.

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:56.309 position:16% line:83% align:start
And I believe, that such
great power ought to be used

00:52:56.443 --> 00:52:58.478 position:7% line:89% align:start
to create great opportunities.

00:52:58.613 --> 00:53:00.848 position:10% line:83% align:start
Have you ever questioned the
current state of the world

00:53:00.982 --> 00:53:03.383 position:33% line:83% align:start
where jujutsu
sorcerers act in secret

00:53:03.518 --> 00:53:05.920 position:21% line:83% align:start
to protect the order
of commonplace society.

00:53:06.054 --> 00:53:07.454 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:53:07.588 --> 00:53:10.124 position:13% line:83% align:start
You see, my friend, there's
this established paradox

00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:13.795 position:7% line:83% align:start
that mistakenly says the strong
must accommodate the weak.

00:53:15.228 --> 00:53:17.799 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's so deplorable.

00:53:17.932 --> 00:53:19.232 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:53:19.366 --> 00:53:21.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's as if the apex of
all creation decided

00:53:21.468 --> 00:53:23.370 position:30% line:83% align:start
to halt its own
path of evolution.

00:53:23.504 --> 00:53:24.972 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's nonsense.

00:53:25.106 --> 00:53:27.374 position:13% line:83% align:start
And it's time for mankind
to reconsider its strategy

00:53:27.508 --> 00:53:28.943 position:33% line:89% align:start
for survival.

00:53:29.077 --> 00:53:33.447 position:19% line:83% align:start
Which is exactly why we
would like you to help us.

00:53:33.581 --> 00:53:34.882 position:24% line:89% align:start
Help you with what?

00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:37.652 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're going to kill
all non-sorcerers,

00:53:37.785 --> 00:53:40.555 position:24% line:83% align:start
and create a world
of jujutsu sorcerers.

00:53:41.923 --> 00:53:42.790 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Maki] What?

00:53:42.924 --> 00:53:44.759 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Panda] Is he serious?

00:53:44.892 --> 00:53:46.127 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Toge grunts)

00:53:46.259 --> 00:53:47.260 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Satoru] Do me a favor.

00:53:47.394 --> 00:53:48.830 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:53:48.963 --> 00:53:50.230 position:21% line:83% align:start
Could you please stop
preaching your crazy beliefs

00:53:50.363 --> 00:53:51.566 position:30% line:89% align:start
to my students?

00:53:54.202 --> 00:53:56.571 position:16% line:89% align:start
Satoru, long time no see.

00:53:56.704 --> 00:53:59.941 position:21% line:83% align:start
Step away from those
kids right now, Suguru.

00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:05.146 position:10% line:83% align:start
I heard this new first-year
class is simply outstanding.

00:54:05.278 --> 00:54:06.379 position:27% line:89% align:start
Seems it's true.

00:54:06.514 --> 00:54:08.649 position:27% line:83% align:start
You still have an
eye for talent.

00:54:08.783 --> 00:54:12.587 position:10% line:83% align:start
A special-grade cursed human,
a cursed corpse mutation,

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:14.722 position:21% line:89% align:start
a cursed speech user.

00:54:14.856 --> 00:54:18.325 position:21% line:83% align:start
And last, the Zen'in
clan's biggest failure.

00:54:18.458 --> 00:54:19.326 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Maki groans)

00:54:19.459 --> 00:54:20.595 position:24% line:89% align:start
You piece of shit.

00:54:20.728 --> 00:54:22.496 position:27% line:83% align:start
You better watch
that mouth of yours.

00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:25.298 position:16% line:83% align:start
Because I don't need any
monkeys like you in the world

00:54:25.432 --> 00:54:26.834 position:24% line:89% align:start
that I'm creating.

00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:31.939 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:54:32.073 --> 00:54:35.643 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't really understand
anything you're talking about

00:54:36.778 --> 00:54:40.915 position:19% line:83% align:start
but I can't help anyone
who insults my friends.

00:54:41.048 --> 00:54:42.950 position:27% line:89% align:start
So count me out.

00:54:43.084 --> 00:54:44.252 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Suguru sighs)

00:54:44.384 --> 00:54:45.820 position:33% line:89% align:start
My apologies.

00:54:45.953 --> 00:54:47.955 position:21% line:83% align:start
I didn't come here to
insult you, or your friends.

00:54:48.089 --> 00:54:49.322 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's good to know.

00:54:49.456 --> 00:54:51.526 position:27% line:83% align:start
Then why exactly
did you come here?

00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:54.996 position:19% line:89% align:start
I came to declare war.

00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:58.599 position:10% line:89% align:start
Everyone gathered here today.

00:54:58.733 --> 00:55:02.335 position:13% line:83% align:start
I want you all to open your
ears and listen closely.

00:55:02.469 --> 00:55:05.673 position:24% line:83% align:start
On December 24th,
when the sun sets,

00:55:05.807 --> 00:55:08.976 position:16% line:83% align:start
we shall begin the Night
Parade of a Hundred Demons.

00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:10.343 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yaga grunts)

00:55:10.477 --> 00:55:14.715 position:24% line:83% align:start
At the crucible of
curses, Shinjuku, Tokyo,

00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:18.953 position:24% line:83% align:start
as well as the holy
land of jujutsu, Kyoto.

00:55:19.086 --> 00:55:22.523 position:13% line:83% align:start
A thousand curses will be
unleashed upon each place.

00:55:22.657 --> 00:55:25.092 position:7% line:89% align:start
All with the command massacre.

00:55:25.226 --> 00:55:27.795 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you wish to avoid a
scene straight from hell,

00:55:27.929 --> 00:55:29.831 position:10% line:89% align:start
come to your best to stop it.

00:55:31.065 --> 00:55:35.136 position:24% line:83% align:start
Let us freely curse
each other to the death.

00:55:35.269 --> 00:55:38.471 position:24% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

00:55:40.608 --> 00:55:41.843 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Nanako shouts)

00:55:41.976 --> 00:55:42.977 position:38% line:89% align:start
Mr. Geto.

00:55:43.110 --> 00:55:45.012 position:16% line:89% align:start
The cafe is gonna close.

00:55:45.146 --> 00:55:46.814 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, is it that late already?

00:55:46.948 --> 00:55:48.683 position:7% line:89% align:start
You know how it is, don't you?

00:55:48.816 --> 00:55:51.252 position:16% line:83% align:start
These girls just have to
get their favorite crepes

00:55:51.384 --> 00:55:53.054 position:19% line:89% align:start
from Takeshita Street.

00:55:53.187 --> 00:55:54.222 position:24% line:89% align:start
Come on, hurry up.

00:55:54.354 --> 00:55:55.823 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll be taking my leave now.

00:55:55.957 --> 00:55:57.992 position:19% line:83% align:start
Nanago, I really don't
see what's so good

00:55:58.125 --> 00:56:00.061 position:24% line:83% align:start
about a place with
so many monkeys.

00:56:00.194 --> 00:56:02.763 position:21% line:83% align:start
You didn't think we'd
just let you leave?

00:56:04.131 --> 00:56:05.800 position:27% line:89% align:start
Careful, Suturu.

00:56:05.933 --> 00:56:08.703 position:27% line:89% align:start
(monster grunts)

00:56:10.638 --> 00:56:13.574 position:27% line:89% align:start
(monster growls)

00:56:13.708 --> 00:56:16.244 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your precious students
are well within my range.

00:56:16.376 --> 00:56:18.913 position:24% line:89% align:start
(monsters growling)

00:56:19.046 --> 00:56:20.014 position:24% line:89% align:start
Goodbye everybody.

00:56:20.147 --> 00:56:21.582 position:24% line:89% align:start
See you at the war.

00:56:23.117 --> 00:56:25.887 position:27% line:89% align:start
(wings whooshes)

00:56:35.395 --> 00:56:37.098 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Suguru] Survival
of the weakest.

00:56:37.231 --> 00:56:39.867 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's the proper form
society should take.

00:56:40.001 --> 00:56:43.137 position:24% line:83% align:start
Help the weak, and
discourage the strong.

00:56:43.271 --> 00:56:44.705 position:30% line:89% align:start
Listen, Satoru.

00:56:44.839 --> 00:56:48.475 position:24% line:83% align:start
Sorcerers exist to
protect non-sorcerers.

00:56:48.609 --> 00:56:50.244 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Satoru] That's your argument?

00:56:50.378 --> 00:56:52.079 position:13% line:89% align:start
God, I hate righteousness.

00:56:55.883 --> 00:56:57.652 position:27% line:83% align:start
Do you think that
you're the strongest

00:56:57.785 --> 00:56:59.887 position:13% line:89% align:start
because you're Satoru Gojo?

00:57:00.021 --> 00:57:02.890 position:19% line:83% align:start
Or are you Satoru Gojo
because you're the strongest?

00:57:03.024 --> 00:57:04.926 position:27% line:83% align:start
What exactly are
you trying to say?

00:57:05.059 --> 00:57:07.228 position:27% line:83% align:start
If I could switch
places with you

00:57:07.361 --> 00:57:09.130 position:5% line:89% align:start
then wouldn't my foolish ideals

00:57:09.263 --> 00:57:11.098 position:5% line:89% align:start
become reasonable possibilities?

00:57:14.702 --> 00:57:16.837 position:16% line:89% align:start
My path leads elsewhere.

00:57:16.971 --> 00:57:20.074 position:13% line:83% align:start
And I plan on following it
to the best of my ability.

00:57:21.575 --> 00:57:24.578 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:57:59.914 --> 00:58:02.183 position:30% line:83% align:start
Suguru Geto, a
special-grade curse user

00:58:02.316 --> 00:58:04.785 position:30% line:83% align:start
who uses cursed
spirit manipulation.

00:58:04.919 --> 00:58:06.454 position:7% line:89% align:start
Able to draw in and manipulate

00:58:06.587 --> 00:58:08.522 position:24% line:83% align:start
naturally occurring
unbound curses.

00:58:08.656 --> 00:58:09.857 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's his skill.

00:58:11.125 --> 00:58:12.326 position:19% line:77% align:start
It seems he's recently
established

00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:13.928 position:21% line:89% align:start
a new religious group

00:58:14.061 --> 00:58:16.731 position:21% line:83% align:start
so that curses can be
collected from its followers.

00:58:16.864 --> 00:58:19.433 position:16% line:83% align:start
This explains the recent
decline in reported curses.

00:58:19.567 --> 00:58:22.703 position:19% line:83% align:start
He already possessed a
significant number of curses,

00:58:22.837 --> 00:58:25.239 position:21% line:83% align:start
and it's for certain
he now has a lot more.

00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:27.942 position:21% line:83% align:start
He claims to possess
2,000 of them

00:58:28.075 --> 00:58:29.844 position:10% line:89% align:start
and that may not be a bluff.

00:58:29.977 --> 00:58:31.645 position:24% line:83% align:start
But statistically,
most of them have got

00:58:31.779 --> 00:58:34.181 position:19% line:83% align:start
to be weaker grade-two
curses or below.

00:58:34.315 --> 00:58:35.850 position:13% line:89% align:start
Also estimating generously,

00:58:35.983 --> 00:58:38.185 position:19% line:83% align:start
he can't have much more
than 50 curse users.

00:58:38.319 --> 00:58:41.355 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's actually the part
that frightens me the most.

00:58:41.489 --> 00:58:42.823 position:16% line:89% align:start
I find it hard to believe

00:58:42.957 --> 00:58:45.493 position:16% line:83% align:start
that he'd want to start a
war that he couldn't win.

00:58:45.626 --> 00:58:47.228 position:38% line:89% align:start
God damn.

00:58:47.361 --> 00:58:48.562 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yaga grunts)

00:58:48.696 --> 00:58:50.297 position:24% line:83% align:start
Put out a call for
aid to all alumni,

00:58:50.431 --> 00:58:54.235 position:13% line:83% align:start
alert the three major clans
and the Ainu Jujutsu Society.

00:58:54.368 --> 00:58:55.703 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's all-out war.

00:58:55.836 --> 00:58:58.105 position:19% line:83% align:start
And it's not just the
curses we'll exorcize,

00:58:58.806 --> 00:58:59.907 position:35% line:89% align:start
it's Geto.

00:59:00.041 --> 00:59:01.175 position:10% line:89% align:start
That muscle-brained principal

00:59:01.308 --> 00:59:03.778 position:27% line:83% align:start
must be having a
fit right about now.

00:59:03.911 --> 00:59:07.114 position:24% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

00:59:14.121 --> 00:59:16.690 position:21% line:83% align:start
If we seriously tried
to kill each other,

00:59:16.824 --> 00:59:21.295 position:21% line:83% align:start
our chance of success
would be about 30%.

00:59:21.429 --> 00:59:24.533 position:33% line:89% align:start
(man grunts)

00:59:24.665 --> 00:59:26.100 position:33% line:89% align:start
(man grunts)

00:59:26.233 --> 00:59:29.870 position:19% line:83% align:start
If the Jujutsu Society
joins, barely a 20% chance.

00:59:31.172 --> 00:59:34.275 position:13% line:83% align:start
However, there is one move
that makes that slim chance

00:59:34.408 --> 00:59:36.110 position:19% line:89% align:start
of victory jump way up.

00:59:37.278 --> 00:59:39.647 position:24% line:89% align:start
Straight up to 99%.

00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:42.049 position:21% line:89% align:start
I kill Yuta Okkotsu,

00:59:42.183 --> 00:59:44.553 position:10% line:83% align:start
and obtain the special-grade
cursed apparition,

00:59:44.685 --> 00:59:46.187 position:33% line:89% align:start
Rika Orimoto.

00:59:47.154 --> 00:59:49.023 position:19% line:83% align:start
They completely bought
my bluff back there

00:59:49.156 --> 00:59:52.660 position:13% line:83% align:start
and now they're gonna give
me exactly what I want.

00:59:52.793 --> 00:59:55.296 position:16% line:83% align:start
It doesn't matter if the
cursed spirit is bound.

00:59:55.429 --> 00:59:57.598 position:10% line:89% align:start
So long as I kill its master,

00:59:57.731 --> 01:00:00.267 position:7% line:89% align:start
I can absorb any curse I want.

01:00:01.936 --> 01:00:03.437 position:27% line:83% align:start
The school likes
their odds of winning,

01:00:03.572 --> 01:00:06.841 position:19% line:83% align:start
so they won't play Yuta
Okkotsu as one of their cards.

01:00:06.974 --> 01:00:08.909 position:5% line:89% align:start
After all, if he unleashes Rika,

01:00:09.043 --> 01:00:10.811 position:7% line:89% align:start
she could wipe out both sides.

01:00:11.178 --> 01:00:13.914 position:13% line:83% align:start
The aim of the Night Parade
of a Hundred Demons is

01:00:14.048 --> 01:00:16.217 position:21% line:83% align:start
to get Okkotsu alone
and unprotected.

01:00:18.819 --> 01:00:23.124 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now, let's raise the
curtain on a new age.

01:00:25.326 --> 01:00:27.094 position:30% line:89% align:start
Well, I guess,

01:00:28.996 --> 01:00:31.499 position:7% line:89% align:start
something crazy is going down.

01:00:32.133 --> 01:00:33.535 position:30% line:83% align:start
-(door slams)
-(Yuta groans)

01:00:33.667 --> 01:00:34.835 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Maki.
-Huh?

01:00:34.969 --> 01:00:36.137 position:16% line:89% align:start
What are you doing here?

01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:38.072 position:21% line:83% align:start
Classes are canceled
for the week.

01:00:38.205 --> 01:00:41.008 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, I was just
feeling kinda restless.

01:00:41.142 --> 01:00:44.111 position:13% line:83% align:start
Doesn't seem like anyone's
around in the dorms either.

01:00:44.245 --> 01:00:45.646 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's because the
second-year students

01:00:45.779 --> 01:00:47.848 position:10% line:89% align:start
were all dispatched to Kyoto.

01:00:47.982 --> 01:00:51.118 position:19% line:83% align:start
Toge's in Shinjuku with
some others as backup.

01:00:51.252 --> 01:00:53.654 position:19% line:83% align:start
And since the Principal
likes Panda so much,

01:00:53.787 --> 01:00:55.489 position:10% line:89% align:start
he's probably with Toge too.

01:00:55.624 --> 01:00:56.824 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

01:01:01.795 --> 01:01:03.464 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Go ahead.
-Huh?

01:01:03.598 --> 01:01:04.999 position:21% line:89% align:start
I know you wanna ask,

01:01:05.132 --> 01:01:07.636 position:24% line:83% align:start
about why Geto said
I was a failure.

01:01:07.768 --> 01:01:11.705 position:24% line:89% align:start
No, I, well, yeah.

01:01:13.642 --> 01:01:15.510 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Maki sighs)

01:01:15.644 --> 01:01:17.244 position:10% line:89% align:start
My family is the Zen'in clan.

01:01:17.378 --> 01:01:21.182 position:7% line:83% align:start
One of the three major families
of elite jujutsu sorcerers.

01:01:21.315 --> 01:01:23.717 position:13% line:83% align:start
Do you have any idea what
the minimum requirement is

01:01:23.851 --> 01:01:25.386 position:16% line:89% align:start
to be a jujutsu sorcerer?

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:27.321 position:24% line:89% align:start
Huh, let me think.

01:01:30.024 --> 01:01:31.725 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Maki] It's being
able to see curses.

01:01:31.859 --> 01:01:33.294 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah, right.

01:01:33.427 --> 01:01:36.665 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ordinary people, even
they sometimes see curses,

01:01:36.797 --> 01:01:39.066 position:27% line:83% align:start
like when they're
at death's door.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.001 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I can't see curses
without the help

01:01:41.135 --> 01:01:43.070 position:19% line:89% align:start
of these lame glasses.

01:01:43.204 --> 01:01:45.507 position:13% line:83% align:start
The cursed tools I use are
imbued with cursed energy

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:46.941 position:27% line:89% align:start
by someone else.

01:01:47.074 --> 01:01:48.342 position:16% line:89% align:start
It doesn't come from me.

01:01:50.211 --> 01:01:53.013 position:16% line:83% align:start
At least this helped get
me out of that family.

01:01:53.147 --> 01:01:55.082 position:19% line:83% align:start
The food was awful, the
rooms were minuscule,

01:01:55.216 --> 01:01:57.686 position:24% line:83% align:start
and it was crawling
with strange old men.

01:01:57.818 --> 01:02:00.054 position:21% line:83% align:start
The whole experience
totally sucked.

01:02:02.223 --> 01:02:03.958 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't use my last name.

01:02:04.091 --> 01:02:05.527 position:16% line:89% align:start
Not everyone's like you.

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:08.329 position:19% line:83% align:start
Most people don't have
resistance to curses.

01:02:08.462 --> 01:02:10.864 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't ask me about
cursed energy.

01:02:14.569 --> 01:02:17.805 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Yuta] So then why are you
still a jujutsu sorcerer?

01:02:17.938 --> 01:02:20.207 position:5% line:89% align:start
Because I happen to be spiteful.

01:02:21.008 --> 01:02:23.043 position:21% line:83% align:start
I plan on returning
to my family one day

01:02:23.177 --> 01:02:25.112 position:16% line:89% align:start
as a grade-one sorcerer.

01:02:25.246 --> 01:02:28.249 position:16% line:83% align:start
And then I'll obliterate
the Zen'in clan from within.

01:02:28.382 --> 01:02:30.884 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll show them that you
don't need to see curses

01:02:31.018 --> 01:02:32.486 position:19% line:89% align:start
to be a great sorcerer.

01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:37.458 position:35% line:89% align:start
What is it?

01:02:37.592 --> 01:02:40.361 position:21% line:83% align:start
I was just thinking,
that's so like you.

01:02:41.696 --> 01:02:42.896 position:41% line:89% align:start
I wish,

01:02:44.231 --> 01:02:46.668 position:5% line:89% align:start
I wish I could be just like you.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:49.638 position:27% line:83% align:start
You know, strong,
and determined.

01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:52.507 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gentle music)

01:02:56.910 --> 01:02:58.212 position:30% line:89% align:start
Honestly, Maki.

01:02:58.345 --> 01:03:00.481 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're the shame
of the Zen'in clan.

01:03:00.615 --> 01:03:01.949 position:13% line:89% align:start
I wish you were never born.

01:03:02.082 --> 01:03:03.450 position:30% line:89% align:start
Everyone, look.

01:03:03.585 --> 01:03:05.152 position:33% line:89% align:start
Look at Maki.

01:03:06.153 --> 01:03:08.355 position:24% line:83% align:start
You don't want to
turn out like her.

01:03:16.864 --> 01:03:19.634 position:7% line:83% align:start
If there's ever anything I can
help you with, just ask me.

01:03:19.768 --> 01:03:23.370 position:10% line:83% align:start
You know, like, obliterating
your clan or something.

01:03:23.505 --> 01:03:26.307 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Yuta giggles)

01:03:26.907 --> 01:03:28.242 position:35% line:89% align:start
You moron.

01:03:28.375 --> 01:03:30.512 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's no point if I
don't do it by myself.

01:03:31.646 --> 01:03:32.813 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm going back to my room.

01:03:32.946 --> 01:03:34.516 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] Okay, later.

01:03:34.649 --> 01:03:37.519 position:30% line:89% align:start
(door whooshes)

01:03:39.119 --> 01:03:41.088 position:30% line:83% align:start
Come on, Maki,
don't be an idiot.

01:03:42.323 --> 01:03:44.958 position:13% line:83% align:start
Don't start believing that
you've really been accepted.

01:03:46.327 --> 01:03:49.496 position:21% line:83% align:start
Emerge from darkness
blacker still.

01:03:49.631 --> 01:03:52.333 position:10% line:89% align:start
Purify that which is impure.

01:03:52.466 --> 01:03:55.502 position:27% line:89% align:start
(veil squelching)

01:03:55.637 --> 01:03:56.503 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

01:03:56.638 --> 01:03:57.505 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Maki groans)

01:03:57.639 --> 01:03:59.440 position:24% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

01:03:59.574 --> 01:04:02.042 position:21% line:83% align:start
A veil's being drawn
over the school?

01:04:02.176 --> 01:04:03.444 position:24% line:89% align:start
But by who and why?

01:04:04.646 --> 01:04:07.448 position:24% line:89% align:start
(monsters grunting)

01:04:09.651 --> 01:04:11.352 position:30% line:83% align:start
Try to keep the
destruction of buildings

01:04:11.485 --> 01:04:13.320 position:19% line:83% align:start
and the infrastructure
to a minimum.

01:04:13.454 --> 01:04:16.156 position:7% line:83% align:start
There's a chance some civilians
still haven't evacuated.

01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:18.459 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you find any, get
them out of here.

01:04:19.059 --> 01:04:20.562 position:7% line:89% align:start
Are you listening to me, Gojo?

01:04:21.328 --> 01:04:24.599 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's one who may
cause us some trouble.

01:04:25.999 --> 01:04:28.536 position:24% line:83% align:start
That bandaged guy,
I'll take him on.

01:04:29.436 --> 01:04:30.538 position:33% line:89% align:start
Sounds good.

01:04:30.672 --> 01:04:32.540 position:19% line:83% align:start
We'll take on the other
jujutsu sorcerers.

01:04:32.674 --> 01:04:33.907 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just one last reminder.

01:04:34.041 --> 01:04:35.376 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I know.

01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:37.311 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're only supposed
to be stalling them.

01:04:37.444 --> 01:04:40.013 position:24% line:83% align:start
Let's just take it
easy and have some fun

01:04:40.147 --> 01:04:42.416 position:10% line:89% align:start
until Geto finishes his job.

01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:44.552 position:16% line:89% align:start
What are you doing here?

01:04:44.686 --> 01:04:46.120 position:13% line:89% align:start
Is it a problem that I am?

01:04:46.253 --> 01:04:49.390 position:16% line:83% align:start
I think the real question
is, what are you doing here?

01:04:50.658 --> 01:04:52.092 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sorry about this,

01:04:52.226 --> 01:04:54.562 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I don't have time
to chat with monkeys.

01:04:55.229 --> 01:04:57.565 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ijichi] Gojo, I have a report.

01:04:59.099 --> 01:05:00.568 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's the matter?

01:05:00.702 --> 01:05:01.902 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

01:05:02.704 --> 01:05:04.204 position:13% line:89% align:start
That guy loves to show off,

01:05:04.338 --> 01:05:06.574 position:27% line:83% align:start
and yet he's not
on the front lines?

01:05:06.708 --> 01:05:08.175 position:30% line:89% align:start
Is he in Kyoto?

01:05:08.308 --> 01:05:11.211 position:19% line:83% align:start
We should have received
some kind of word if he was.

01:05:11.345 --> 01:05:13.515 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just lost in thought, what's up?

01:05:13.648 --> 01:05:15.949 position:27% line:83% align:start
I know this isn't
really the best time,

01:05:16.083 --> 01:05:17.451 position:7% line:89% align:start
but I thought you should know.

01:05:17.585 --> 01:05:19.286 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's about the
investigation into Yuta

01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:21.422 position:13% line:89% align:start
that you requested earlier.

01:05:24.626 --> 01:05:25.492 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Satoru gasps)

01:05:25.627 --> 01:05:26.493 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Satoru] Panda, Toge.

01:05:26.628 --> 01:05:27.762 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

01:05:27.896 --> 01:05:28.962 position:35% line:89% align:start
What is it?

01:05:29.096 --> 01:05:30.532 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(Panda groaning)
-No questions.

01:05:30.665 --> 01:05:33.635 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm sending both of you
to Jujutsu High right now.

01:05:33.768 --> 01:05:35.002 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:05:35.135 --> 01:05:36.003 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Satoru] Geto is there.

01:05:36.136 --> 01:05:37.237 position:33% line:89% align:start
He has to be.

01:05:37.371 --> 01:05:38.840 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm absolutely certain of it.

01:05:38.972 --> 01:05:39.841 position:38% line:89% align:start
Probably.

01:05:39.973 --> 01:05:41.141 position:24% line:89% align:start
Well, which is it?

01:05:41.275 --> 01:05:42.744 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Satoru] If my
intuition is right,

01:05:42.877 --> 01:05:44.978 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yuta and Maki might both die.

01:05:45.112 --> 01:05:46.648 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Panda gasps)

01:05:46.781 --> 01:05:48.982 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll join you after I take
care of that foreign sorcerer.

01:05:49.116 --> 01:05:50.384 position:16% line:89% align:start
Protect the two of them.

01:05:50.518 --> 01:05:52.587 position:10% line:89% align:start
Defend them with your lives.

01:05:54.288 --> 01:05:56.089 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Right.
-[Toge] Salmon.

01:05:56.223 --> 01:05:58.192 position:30% line:89% align:start
(wind whooshes)

01:05:58.325 --> 01:05:59.493 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Suda groans)

01:05:59.627 --> 01:06:01.128 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Suda] No way, they
figured it out?

01:06:01.261 --> 01:06:02.530 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Miguel] This is why I said,

01:06:02.664 --> 01:06:05.098 position:24% line:83% align:start
you should at least
prepare a stand-in.

01:06:05.232 --> 01:06:07.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
Geto didn't wanna
use a bad dummy.

01:06:07.234 --> 01:06:09.470 position:27% line:83% align:start
He said it would
make things worse.

01:06:09.604 --> 01:06:10.605 position:30% line:89% align:start
Mimiko, Nanako.

01:06:11.438 --> 01:06:12.306 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

01:06:12.574 --> 01:06:13.875 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Suda] We're
stepping up the plan.

01:06:14.007 --> 01:06:15.108 position:41% line:89% align:start
Engage.

01:06:15.242 --> 01:06:16.443 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Nanako giggles)

01:06:18.546 --> 01:06:20.548 position:13% line:89% align:start
I've been waiting for this.

01:06:20.682 --> 01:06:22.684 position:24% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

01:06:22.817 --> 01:06:24.886 position:16% line:89% align:start
Let me introduce myself.

01:06:25.018 --> 01:06:27.789 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm Miguel, your opponent.

01:06:27.922 --> 01:06:32.627 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Satoru] Sorry, Miguel but
I'm in a hurry right now.

01:06:36.163 --> 01:06:37.030 position:30% line:89% align:start
(wind whooshes)

01:06:37.164 --> 01:06:38.131 position:21% line:89% align:start
A veil's been drawn.

01:06:38.265 --> 01:06:40.033 position:10% line:89% align:start
Satoru's intuition was right.

01:06:40.167 --> 01:06:41.569 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'll break the veil.

01:06:41.703 --> 01:06:43.605 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then we'll take the
shortest most direct route.

01:06:43.738 --> 01:06:44.639 position:38% line:89% align:start
Let's go.

01:06:44.772 --> 01:06:45.974 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Pollack roe.

01:06:46.106 --> 01:06:47.575 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

01:06:47.709 --> 01:06:48.843 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Suguru giggles)

01:06:48.977 --> 01:06:51.546 position:19% line:83% align:start
Looks like someone made
a hole in the veil.

01:06:51.679 --> 01:06:52.947 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Suguru sighs)

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:56.083 position:13% line:83% align:start
It seems like these things
never go quite as planned.

01:06:56.216 --> 01:06:58.018 position:24% line:83% align:start
It should take them
about five minutes

01:06:58.151 --> 01:07:00.487 position:24% line:83% align:start
from the point of
entry to get here.

01:07:00.622 --> 01:07:03.791 position:16% line:83% align:start
Should I ignore them, or
should I take care of them?

01:07:04.993 --> 01:07:07.494 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's just so hard to decide.

01:07:08.696 --> 01:07:11.733 position:27% line:89% align:start
(explosion booms)

01:07:12.834 --> 01:07:14.167 position:5% line:89% align:start
Did they break through the walls

01:07:14.301 --> 01:07:16.704 position:21% line:83% align:start
to take the shortest
route to me?

01:07:16.838 --> 01:07:18.472 position:38% line:89% align:start
Not bad.

01:07:18.606 --> 01:07:21.709 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Panda grunts)

01:07:21.843 --> 01:07:22.710 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Panda] Maki.

01:07:23.176 --> 01:07:24.044 position:33% line:83% align:start
-(foot thuds)
-(Panda grunts)

01:07:24.177 --> 01:07:25.379 position:41% line:89% align:start
Focus.

01:07:26.146 --> 01:07:27.447 position:33% line:83% align:start
-(fist thuds)
-(Panda grunts)

01:07:27.582 --> 01:07:30.183 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Panda] This guy can
handle close combat, too?

01:07:31.986 --> 01:07:34.756 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Panda grunts)

01:07:39.894 --> 01:07:42.764 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Panda grunts)

01:07:42.897 --> 01:07:43.698 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh?

01:07:43.831 --> 01:07:46.734 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Panda grunting)

01:07:52.205 --> 01:07:55.108 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Panda grunting)

01:07:56.076 --> 01:07:57.545 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're very predictable.

01:07:57.679 --> 01:07:59.881 position:10% line:89% align:start
Because I was setting you up.

01:08:00.014 --> 01:08:01.281 position:30% line:89% align:start
(air whooshes)

01:08:01.415 --> 01:08:03.618 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Panda] Drumming Beat.

01:08:07.889 --> 01:08:10.792 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Panda grunting)

01:08:10.925 --> 01:08:13.928 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Geto chuckes)

01:08:14.062 --> 01:08:16.864 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Panda grunting)

01:08:19.199 --> 01:08:20.068 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(stick whooshes)
-(Geto grunts)

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:22.670 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Panda grunts)

01:08:22.804 --> 01:08:23.503 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Panda groans)

01:08:23.638 --> 01:08:25.073 position:13% line:89% align:start
Boy, that was a close one.

01:08:25.205 --> 01:08:26.874 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Panda] I couldn't agree more.

01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:30.511 position:38% line:89% align:start
Plummet.

01:08:31.746 --> 01:08:34.582 position:27% line:89% align:start
(explosion booms)

01:08:38.886 --> 01:08:40.922 position:24% line:89% align:start
Toge, are you okay?

01:08:41.055 --> 01:08:42.322 position:41% line:89% align:start
Caviar.

01:08:42.456 --> 01:08:44.626 position:30% line:83% align:start
Good, come on,
let's check on Maki.

01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:49.463 position:24% line:89% align:start
Maki, are you okay?

01:08:49.597 --> 01:08:50.263 position:44% line:89% align:start
Maki?

01:08:50.397 --> 01:08:51.666 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Mustard leaf.

01:08:51.799 --> 01:08:52.667 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Maki groans)

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:53.668 position:47% line:89% align:start
No.

01:08:53.801 --> 01:08:55.637 position:24% line:89% align:start
No, not yet, don't.

01:08:55.770 --> 01:08:56.638 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:08:56.771 --> 01:08:58.271 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Toge groans)

01:08:58.405 --> 01:09:01.341 position:27% line:89% align:start
(ground rumbles)

01:09:05.278 --> 01:09:06.848 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

01:09:06.981 --> 01:09:08.215 position:24% line:89% align:start
Another earthquake?

01:09:08.348 --> 01:09:10.350 position:30% line:83% align:start
I wonder what's
going on down there.

01:09:12.987 --> 01:09:13.788 position:35% line:89% align:start
Wonderful.

01:09:13.921 --> 01:09:15.590 position:27% line:89% align:start
Simply wonderful.

01:09:15.723 --> 01:09:18.626 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm so incredibly
touched right now.

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:21.663 position:19% line:83% align:start
You all raced down here
to save Yuta Okkotsu.

01:09:21.796 --> 01:09:25.967 position:10% line:83% align:start
Jujutsu sorcerers sacrificing
themselves for a colleague.

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:27.300 position:30% line:89% align:start
Such affection.

01:09:27.434 --> 01:09:28.603 position:27% line:89% align:start
Such admiration.

01:09:28.736 --> 01:09:30.505 position:10% line:89% align:start
This is the world I long for.

01:09:30.638 --> 01:09:33.240 position:7% line:89% align:start
All here right before my eyes.

01:09:33.373 --> 01:09:36.577 position:24% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

01:09:40.882 --> 01:09:41.883 position:38% line:89% align:start
Maki, no.

01:09:42.984 --> 01:09:44.418 position:19% line:89% align:start
To be honest with you.

01:09:44.552 --> 01:09:47.789 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wanted you to live
too, Yuta, I really did.

01:09:47.922 --> 01:09:51.759 position:13% line:83% align:start
But this battle is for the
future of the jujutsu world.

01:09:51.893 --> 01:09:52.894 position:41% line:89% align:start
Panda.

01:09:54.194 --> 01:09:55.563 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Yuta.

01:09:57.765 --> 01:09:58.766 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] Toge.

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:02.837 position:38% line:89% align:start
Run away.

01:10:05.405 --> 01:10:07.909 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta grunts)

01:10:09.342 --> 01:10:10.912 position:30% line:89% align:start
Come out, Rika.

01:10:12.647 --> 01:10:15.850 position:24% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

01:10:17.051 --> 01:10:18.886 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm going to kill you.

01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:20.420 position:24% line:89% align:start
Not before you die.

01:10:21.321 --> 01:10:24.525 position:24% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

01:10:33.333 --> 01:10:34.535 position:24% line:89% align:start
(monster growling)

01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:36.571 position:16% line:89% align:start
Quantity before quality.

01:10:36.704 --> 01:10:39.774 position:27% line:83% align:start
What's your next
move Queen of Curses?

01:10:39.907 --> 01:10:42.810 position:24% line:89% align:start
(monster growling)

01:10:47.181 --> 01:10:52.053 position:19% line:83% align:start
-(monsters squelching)
-(monsters growling)

01:10:52.186 --> 01:10:53.054 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Rika growls)

01:10:53.187 --> 01:10:56.057 position:27% line:89% align:start
(explosion booms)

01:10:56.190 --> 01:10:57.592 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] Good job, Rika.

01:11:01.461 --> 01:11:04.866 position:16% line:83% align:start
These three are horribly
wounded, especially Maki.

01:11:04.999 --> 01:11:06.500 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Maki groans)

01:11:06.634 --> 01:11:08.268 position:21% line:89% align:start
I won't let you die.

01:11:10.772 --> 01:11:14.575 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Maki breathes heavily)

01:11:16.544 --> 01:11:18.980 position:10% line:89% align:start
Not fair, not fair, not fair.

01:11:19.113 --> 01:11:20.081 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's always you.

01:11:20.214 --> 01:11:21.983 position:24% line:89% align:start
It was always you.

01:11:22.116 --> 01:11:23.251 position:16% line:89% align:start
What are you doing, Rika?

01:11:23.383 --> 01:11:24.484 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:11:24.619 --> 01:11:26.087 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's the woman
who saved my life.

01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:28.723 position:13% line:83% align:start
Handle her with more care
than you would a butterfly

01:11:28.856 --> 01:11:29.857 position:33% line:89% align:start
or a flower.

01:11:31.125 --> 01:11:33.460 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Rika groans)

01:11:33.594 --> 01:11:34.929 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, Yuta.

01:11:35.062 --> 01:11:36.097 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

01:11:36.230 --> 01:11:37.965 position:21% line:89% align:start
Please don't be mad.

01:11:38.099 --> 01:11:39.299 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm not mad at you.

01:11:39.432 --> 01:11:41.102 position:30% line:83% align:start
Please, I don't
want you to hate me.

01:11:41.235 --> 01:11:42.970 position:19% line:89% align:start
I could never hate you.

01:11:44.739 --> 01:11:47.008 position:10% line:89% align:start
Our enemy is that man there.

01:11:47.141 --> 01:11:49.476 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Rika] Yuta, do you hate him?

01:11:49.610 --> 01:11:51.546 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] Yes, I loathe him.

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:55.116 position:13% line:89% align:start
Then I will hate him, too.

01:11:55.249 --> 01:11:57.051 position:33% line:89% align:start
Welcome back.

01:11:58.318 --> 01:12:00.221 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why did you stop attacking?

01:12:00.353 --> 01:12:01.656 position:13% line:89% align:start
Healing with cursed energy

01:12:01.789 --> 01:12:04.892 position:21% line:83% align:start
requires an advanced
reverse cursed technique.

01:12:05.026 --> 01:12:06.194 position:16% line:89% align:start
It was more advantageous

01:12:06.326 --> 01:12:08.996 position:19% line:83% align:start
to let you divide your
attention over there.

01:12:09.130 --> 01:12:11.364 position:16% line:89% align:start
But now that you're back,

01:12:11.498 --> 01:12:13.935 position:27% line:83% align:start
shall we pick up
where we left off?

01:12:14.068 --> 01:12:15.468 position:24% line:89% align:start
(monsters hissing)

01:12:15.603 --> 01:12:16.938 position:21% line:89% align:start
Rika, give it to me.

01:12:20.775 --> 01:12:22.710 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Suguru] Snake Eyes and Fangs?

01:12:22.844 --> 01:12:26.981 position:21% line:83% align:start
Those are the cursed
seals of the Inumaki clan.

01:12:27.648 --> 01:12:31.219 position:24% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

01:12:31.351 --> 01:12:34.555 position:24% line:89% align:start
(monsters growling)

01:12:35.455 --> 01:12:36.657 position:44% line:89% align:start
Die.

01:12:40.161 --> 01:12:42.997 position:27% line:89% align:start
(explosion booms)

01:12:44.065 --> 01:12:45.099 position:30% line:89% align:start
How wonderful.

01:12:46.334 --> 01:12:48.135 position:13% line:83% align:start
Cursed speech is a powerful
technique passed down

01:12:48.269 --> 01:12:51.438 position:16% line:83% align:start
in the Inumaki clan, yet
this young man pulled it off

01:12:51.572 --> 01:12:54.075 position:21% line:83% align:start
with less than a year
of studying jujutsu.

01:12:54.208 --> 01:12:55.843 position:13% line:89% align:start
That really is hard to use.

01:12:55.977 --> 01:12:58.880 position:13% line:83% align:start
The cursed energy scatters,
and it's hard to focus at.

01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:00.848 position:21% line:89% align:start
Inumaki's incredible.

01:13:02.016 --> 01:13:03.117 position:35% line:89% align:start
I see now.

01:13:03.251 --> 01:13:05.853 position:24% line:83% align:start
Rika Orimoto's true
form, it's ever-changing.

01:13:05.987 --> 01:13:08.356 position:30% line:83% align:start
She's a bastion
of cursed energy.

01:13:08.488 --> 01:13:09.891 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's true.

01:13:10.024 --> 01:13:12.927 position:24% line:83% align:start
All my friend's are
so amazing and strong.

01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:14.095 position:33% line:89% align:start
And you Rika.

01:13:14.228 --> 01:13:15.428 position:33% line:89% align:start
You are, too.

01:13:15.563 --> 01:13:18.065 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sorry, but I need
her more than you do.

01:13:19.834 --> 01:13:21.736 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] I'll beat you to a pulp.

01:13:25.405 --> 01:13:26.641 position:27% line:89% align:start
(explosion booms)

01:13:26.774 --> 01:13:31.979 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(man grunting)
-(fist thudding)

01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:33.948 position:27% line:89% align:start
(monster growls)

01:13:34.081 --> 01:13:36.918 position:30% line:89% align:start
(man grunting)

01:13:37.051 --> 01:13:39.754 position:27% line:89% align:start
(monster groans)

01:13:43.090 --> 01:13:44.025 position:30% line:89% align:start
(man grunting)

01:13:44.158 --> 01:13:47.561 position:16% line:89% align:start
(monster blood splashes)

01:13:50.631 --> 01:13:52.066 position:44% line:89% align:start
Whoo.

01:13:52.199 --> 01:13:53.267 position:30% line:89% align:start
Nanami's here.

01:13:53.401 --> 01:13:54.769 position:27% line:83% align:start
Good, he'll get a
chance to see me.

01:13:54.902 --> 01:13:56.771 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is my shot to
really impress him.

01:13:56.904 --> 01:13:58.139 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Will you shut up?

01:13:58.272 --> 01:14:00.641 position:24% line:83% align:start
Quit bubling about
yourself and fight.

01:14:00.775 --> 01:14:01.976 position:5% line:89% align:start
There's still a lot more coming.

01:14:02.109 --> 01:14:04.645 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(monster growls)
-(Kusakabe grunts)

01:14:04.779 --> 01:14:06.781 position:27% line:89% align:start
Man, what a pain.

01:14:08.649 --> 01:14:10.351 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Mei giggles)

01:14:10.483 --> 01:14:13.521 position:27% line:89% align:start
(blade whooshing)

01:14:16.090 --> 01:14:17.024 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Mei giggles)

01:14:17.158 --> 01:14:20.194 position:27% line:89% align:start
(blade whooshing)

01:14:21.996 --> 01:14:24.231 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Mei grunts)

01:14:27.234 --> 01:14:28.102 position:27% line:89% align:start
(blade clanging)

01:14:28.235 --> 01:14:29.937 position:19% line:89% align:start
That makes it 50 kills.

01:14:30.071 --> 01:14:32.139 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've passed the numbers
needed for the incentive.

01:14:32.273 --> 01:14:34.175 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's time to work
a little bit harder

01:14:34.308 --> 01:14:37.545 position:19% line:83% align:start
and then I'll be taking
home that full bonus pay.

01:14:41.749 --> 01:14:43.551 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, my, how old are you two?

01:14:43.684 --> 01:14:44.919 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Nanako] 15.

01:14:45.052 --> 01:14:46.988 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're still just children.

01:14:47.121 --> 01:14:49.290 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's not too late
for you to turn back.

01:14:50.024 --> 01:14:51.459 position:30% line:83% align:start
You don't even
know the difference

01:14:51.592 --> 01:14:53.527 position:10% line:89% align:start
between right and wrong yet.

01:14:53.661 --> 01:14:54.962 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're annoying.

01:14:55.096 --> 01:14:57.531 position:24% line:83% align:start
Mimiko, doesn't he
totally piss you off?

01:14:57.665 --> 01:14:59.567 position:13% line:89% align:start
Shall we hang him, Nanako?

01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:00.668 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're oblivious.

01:15:00.801 --> 01:15:02.703 position:27% line:89% align:start
You have no idea.

01:15:02.837 --> 01:15:05.006 position:13% line:83% align:start
You don't know how jujutsu
sorcerers are treated

01:15:05.139 --> 01:15:07.675 position:21% line:83% align:start
when they grow up out
in the damn sticks,

01:15:07.808 --> 01:15:09.710 position:13% line:89% align:start
in places not even on maps.

01:15:10.644 --> 01:15:12.747 position:27% line:83% align:start
Right and wrong?
(Nanako scoffs)

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:16.183 position:16% line:83% align:start
All of you just go ahead
and enjoy that stuff.

01:15:16.317 --> 01:15:19.653 position:21% line:83% align:start
The way Mr. Geto puts
it, black is white,

01:15:19.787 --> 01:15:21.989 position:16% line:89% align:start
and white is black, too.

01:15:24.992 --> 01:15:26.727 position:19% line:89% align:start
When Mr. Geto found us,

01:15:26.861 --> 01:15:30.765 position:16% line:83% align:start
he shared his vision for
a wonderful new world.

01:15:31.732 --> 01:15:34.335 position:19% line:83% align:start
And anyone who gets in
his way, we'll hang.

01:15:34.468 --> 01:15:35.503 position:27% line:89% align:start
(explosion booms)

01:15:35.636 --> 01:15:39.140 position:13% line:89% align:start
(Nanako and Mimiko groans)

01:15:39.273 --> 01:15:40.141 position:41% line:89% align:start
Miguel?

01:15:40.274 --> 01:15:41.375 position:16% line:89% align:start
What are you doing here?

01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:43.210 position:7% line:89% align:start
Take a look and figure it out.

01:15:43.344 --> 01:15:45.246 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Satoru] You're a tenacious one.

01:15:45.913 --> 01:15:48.783 position:30% line:89% align:start
(rope whooshes)

01:15:49.917 --> 01:15:53.687 position:21% line:83% align:start
That rope, it has an
unusual curse woven into it.

01:15:53.821 --> 01:15:55.756 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's disrupting my techniques.

01:15:56.757 --> 01:15:58.993 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Miguel] I barely have
half of my rope left.

01:15:59.126 --> 01:16:01.562 position:19% line:83% align:start
How many decades do you
think it took the sorcerers

01:16:01.695 --> 01:16:06.233 position:13% line:83% align:start
in my country to weave this
rope imbued with cursed energy?

01:16:06.367 --> 01:16:07.536 position:33% line:89% align:start
Like I care.

01:16:07.668 --> 01:16:09.538 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can outmatch it
in about one second.

01:16:09.670 --> 01:16:11.806 position:24% line:89% align:start
(monster laughing)

01:16:11.939 --> 01:16:13.140 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're in the way.

01:16:14.375 --> 01:16:16.277 position:27% line:89% align:start
(monster groans)

01:16:16.410 --> 01:16:18.279 position:27% line:89% align:start
(explosion booms)

01:16:18.412 --> 01:16:19.413 position:13% line:89% align:start
(Mimiko and Nanako groans)

01:16:19.548 --> 01:16:20.748 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Ijichi] Oh, no,
this isn't good.

01:16:20.881 --> 01:16:22.283 position:30% line:89% align:start
Gojo's snapped.

01:16:22.416 --> 01:16:24.585 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Miguel] So, this is the
limitless jujutsu technique

01:16:24.718 --> 01:16:26.020 position:21% line:89% align:start
that Geto mentioned.

01:16:26.153 --> 01:16:28.222 position:27% line:83% align:start
It interferes on
an atomic level,

01:16:28.355 --> 01:16:29.924 position:13% line:89% align:start
controlling space and time

01:16:30.057 --> 01:16:33.160 position:16% line:83% align:start

is the power of his eyes.

01:16:36.964 --> 01:16:40.501 position:13% line:83% align:start
I have just 12 more minutes
until my quota runs out.

01:16:40.634 --> 01:16:42.369 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll keep fight for my life.

That last round was dangerous.

01:17:52.406 --> 01:17:53.807 position:16% line:89% align:start
I need to be more focus.

01:17:53.941 --> 01:17:55.075 position:27% line:89% align:start
10 more minutes.

01:17:55.209 --> 01:17:57.144 position:33% line:83% align:start
Time to give
everything I've got.

01:17:57.278 --> 01:18:00.314 position:21% line:83% align:start
If I die tonight, I'm
cursing you, Geto.

(people groaning)

01:18:04.485 --> 01:18:06.387 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Akari] Shoko, this
one needs your help.

01:18:06.521 --> 01:18:08.756 position:21% line:83% align:start
Just set him down and
I'll be there soon.

01:18:08.889 --> 01:18:10.491 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Akari] Right.
Look at this.

01:18:10.625 --> 01:18:11.825 position:16% line:89% align:start
What were you all doing?

01:18:11.959 --> 01:18:13.260 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're gonna be okay.

01:18:13.394 --> 01:18:16.330 position:21% line:83% align:start
Shoko's gonna fix you
right up, all right?

01:18:17.632 --> 01:18:18.899 position:19% line:89% align:start
We're counting on you.

01:18:20.968 --> 01:18:22.236 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Shoko scoffs)

01:18:22.369 --> 01:18:25.706 position:16% line:83% align:start
You really forced a heap
of trouble on us, Geto.

01:18:28.242 --> 01:18:30.744 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's the first time you've
experiencing violent emotions

01:18:30.878 --> 01:18:33.080 position:19% line:83% align:start
as cursed energy fills
your body, isn't it?

01:18:33.214 --> 01:18:36.784 position:10% line:83% align:start
That heightening of physical
prowess, of omnipotence.

01:18:36.917 --> 01:18:39.787 position:24% line:83% align:start
Your senses become
sharper and sharper.

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:42.856 position:21% line:83% align:start
The riff-raff are no
longer a match for you.

01:18:42.990 --> 01:18:45.226 position:27% line:83% align:start
So, I'll have to
crush you myself.

01:18:46.661 --> 01:18:48.429 position:21% line:89% align:start
Follow my lead, Rika.

01:18:49.230 --> 01:18:52.399 position:19% line:83% align:start
Mankind stands at the
top of the food chain,

01:18:52.534 --> 01:18:54.969 position:21% line:83% align:start
yet they imagined the
existence of higher beings

01:18:55.102 --> 01:18:56.370 position:21% line:89% align:start
and called them gods.

01:18:56.503 --> 01:18:59.139 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't you find that
awfully strange?

01:18:59.273 --> 01:19:03.277 position:16% line:83% align:start
Especially since jujutsu
sorcerers exist without belief.

In the end, all those monkeys

01:19:57.264 --> 01:19:59.933 position:16% line:83% align:start
just want to avert their
eyes from the existence

01:20:00.067 --> 01:20:01.268 position:13% line:89% align:start
of those better than them.

01:20:01.402 --> 01:20:03.170 position:24% line:83% align:start
Are you saying you
wanna be a god?

01:20:03.304 --> 01:20:05.806 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's something
a child would say.

01:20:05.939 --> 01:20:08.275 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're missing the
point, Okkotsu.

(ground rumbles)

01:20:24.425 --> 01:20:27.061 position:16% line:83% align:start
What I long for isn't any
kind of enlightenment.

01:20:27.194 --> 01:20:28.763 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's a chosen people.

01:20:28.896 --> 01:20:31.332 position:7% line:83% align:start
There are times when the strong
are completely overwhelmed

01:20:31.465 --> 01:20:34.536 position:13% line:83% align:start
by the weak, due to their
strength in sheer numbers.

01:20:34.669 --> 01:20:37.137 position:24% line:83% align:start
And the audacity of
those weak monkeys,

01:20:37.271 --> 01:20:39.173 position:21% line:83% align:start
that they think they
can defeat the strong,

01:20:39.306 --> 01:20:41.375 position:5% line:89% align:start
makes me so sick I could vomit.

01:20:42.610 --> 01:20:44.478 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yuta, are you okay?

01:20:44.612 --> 01:20:45.979 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm all right, Rika.

01:20:46.113 --> 01:20:47.515 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm used to it now.

01:20:47.649 --> 01:20:49.818 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are we done debating philosophy?

You shouldn't have done that.

01:21:13.407 --> 01:21:15.510 position:19% line:83% align:start
When you imbue a curse
like that too abruptly,

01:21:15.643 --> 01:21:17.077 position:19% line:89% align:start
the vessel won't last.

01:21:17.211 --> 01:21:20.782 position:13% line:83% align:start
Didn't Satoru teach you to
imbue curses bit by bit.

The kid's not bad.

01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:37.665 position:13% line:89% align:start
What are you talking about?

01:21:37.799 --> 01:21:40.934 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't know about any sorcerers
outside of this school,

01:21:41.068 --> 01:21:43.705 position:24% line:83% align:start
so I don't know if
you're right or wrong.

01:21:43.838 --> 01:21:45.573 position:16% line:89% align:start
But I do know one thing.

01:21:45.707 --> 01:21:48.510 position:19% line:83% align:start
I know that in order to
remain here with my friends

01:21:48.643 --> 01:21:51.880 position:10% line:83% align:start
and in order to believe it's
okay that I'm still alive.

01:21:52.012 --> 01:21:53.981 position:16% line:89% align:start
I know what I have to do.

01:21:55.583 --> 01:21:57.151 position:27% line:89% align:start
I have to do it.

01:21:57.284 --> 01:21:59.654 position:27% line:83% align:start
I have no choice
but to kill you.

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.790 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're a little egotistical.

01:22:01.922 --> 01:22:04.291 position:10% line:89% align:start
Nonetheless, just keep it up.

01:22:04.425 --> 01:22:06.260 position:7% line:89% align:start
Those daily self-affirmations.

01:22:06.393 --> 01:22:09.496 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's nothing more
important in life.

01:22:09.631 --> 01:22:11.064 position:19% line:89% align:start
Unfortunately, though,

01:22:11.198 --> 01:22:14.301 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm going to use my full
force to kill you now.

01:22:14.435 --> 01:22:16.604 position:10% line:89% align:start
No more time for compromise.

01:22:16.738 --> 01:22:19.607 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are you aware, there
are only four people

01:22:19.741 --> 01:22:21.375 position:19% line:89% align:start
who are special-grade?

01:22:21.509 --> 01:22:24.077 position:13% line:89% align:start
Among curses, there are 16.

01:22:24.211 --> 01:22:26.280 position:27% line:83% align:start
Let me introduce
you to one of them.

01:22:26.413 --> 01:22:29.183 position:33% line:83% align:start
Special-grade
potential apparition,

01:22:29.950 --> 01:22:32.352 position:16% line:89% align:start
Incarnate, Tamamo-no-mae.

01:22:33.086 --> 01:22:34.421 position:30% line:89% align:start
On top of that,

01:22:34.556 --> 01:22:39.159 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll combine the 4,461
curses I possess into one

01:22:39.293 --> 01:22:40.728 position:19% line:89% align:start
and strike you with it.

01:24:26.166 --> 01:24:27.735 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Miwa sighs)

01:24:27.869 --> 01:24:29.771 position:30% line:89% align:start
(fire whooshes)

01:24:29.904 --> 01:24:30.905 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:24:31.739 --> 01:24:34.308 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Mechamaru] Don't let
your guard down, Miwa.

01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:36.778 position:21% line:89% align:start
Mechamaru, look out.

01:24:36.911 --> 01:24:39.246 position:35% line:89% align:start
(gun fires)

01:24:40.949 --> 01:24:42.650 position:16% line:89% align:start
You better look out, too.

01:24:43.585 --> 01:24:46.219 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Kamo] Everyone, make
sure you stay alert.

01:24:47.454 --> 01:24:50.490 position:16% line:83% align:start
Kamo, I see seven cursed
spirits heading your way.

01:24:50.625 --> 01:24:52.794 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Kamo] Roger that,
where did Todo go?

01:24:52.927 --> 01:24:54.662 position:27% line:89% align:start
(explosion booms)

01:24:54.796 --> 01:24:59.166 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Momo] Oh, I think you'll
see him soon enough.

01:25:00.034 --> 01:25:02.737 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Todo grunts)

01:25:03.771 --> 01:25:04.839 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Todo chuckles)

01:25:04.973 --> 01:25:07.240 position:21% line:83% align:start
Where have you been
all this time, Todo?

01:25:08.776 --> 01:25:09.644 position:27% line:89% align:start
(ground rumbles)

01:25:09.777 --> 01:25:11.012 position:24% line:89% align:start
(monster growling)

01:25:11.144 --> 01:25:12.747 position:10% line:83% align:start
(Kamo groans) I've never seen
cursed energy like that.

01:25:14.949 --> 01:25:16.249 position:5% line:89% align:start
That one's real dangerous, Todo.

01:25:16.383 --> 01:25:17.484 position:13% line:89% align:start
Don't rush in on your own.

01:25:17.619 --> 01:25:18.920 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Wait for back.
-Sorry,

01:25:19.053 --> 01:25:20.454 position:24% line:83% align:start
but the talk show's
live Christmas special

01:25:20.588 --> 01:25:22.255 position:7% line:89% align:start
is gonna be starting at eight.

01:25:22.389 --> 01:25:24.759 position:27% line:83% align:start
And it'll will be
hosting Takada.

01:25:25.927 --> 01:25:29.530 position:13% line:83% align:start
Let's stop wasting our time
and get this fight over with.

01:25:29.664 --> 01:25:30.665 position:44% line:89% align:start
Todo.

01:25:30.798 --> 01:25:31.966 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Momo] Kamo.

01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:34.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
Another 10 or more cursed
spirits are approaching

01:25:34.301 --> 01:25:35.803 position:27% line:89% align:start
from six o'clock.

01:25:35.937 --> 01:25:36.871 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Kamo groans)

01:25:37.005 --> 01:25:38.606 position:5% line:89% align:start
Everyone, prepare to intercept.

01:25:40.074 --> 01:25:40.942 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Mai scoffs)

01:25:41.075 --> 01:25:42.242 position:19% line:89% align:start
These curses never end.

01:25:42.376 --> 01:25:44.211 position:21% line:83% align:start
When is this finally
going to be over?

01:25:47.849 --> 01:25:50.317 position:19% line:89% align:start
Okkotsu, I'm so happy.

01:25:50.450 --> 01:25:52.754 position:21% line:83% align:start
My timing was perfect
because I came to kill you

01:25:52.887 --> 01:25:56.791 position:19% line:83% align:start
before you could fully
unleash Rika Orimoto.

01:26:03.765 --> 01:26:06.500 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Rika] It's a promise
that when we grow up,

01:26:06.634 --> 01:26:09.369 position:24% line:83% align:start
we're going to get
married to each other.

01:26:09.503 --> 01:26:14.709 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Yuta] Okay, we'll be
together forever and ever.

01:26:16.044 --> 01:26:17.310 position:33% line:89% align:start
All the time.

01:26:23.985 --> 01:26:24.852 position:44% line:89% align:start
Rika.

01:26:24.986 --> 01:26:26.319 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Rika] Yes, Yuta?

01:26:26.453 --> 01:26:29.157 position:21% line:83% align:start
Thank you for always
protecting me.

01:26:29.289 --> 01:26:31.693 position:21% line:83% align:start
Thank you for falling
in love with me.

01:26:32.827 --> 01:26:35.963 position:24% line:83% align:start
Just one last time,
please, lend me your power.

01:26:38.166 --> 01:26:40.333 position:24% line:89% align:start
I have to stop him.

01:26:40.467 --> 01:26:42.937 position:21% line:83% align:start
I won't need anything
else from you after that.

01:26:44.038 --> 01:26:47.875 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll give you my future,
my heart, my body.

01:26:48.009 --> 01:26:49.677 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll give you everything.

01:26:50.745 --> 01:26:54.849 position:16% line:83% align:start
From now on, we'll truly
be together forever.

01:26:56.884 --> 01:26:59.352 position:27% line:89% align:start
I love you, Rika.

01:27:01.321 --> 01:27:02.890 position:24% line:89% align:start
Let's die together.

01:27:07.995 --> 01:27:10.865 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Rika grunting)

01:27:12.365 --> 01:27:13.668 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yuta.

01:27:13.801 --> 01:27:14.802 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yuta.

01:27:15.335 --> 01:27:18.072 position:19% line:89% align:start
I love you, I love you.

01:27:18.206 --> 01:27:20.541 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Suguru] Is he offering
himself as a sacrifice

01:27:20.675 --> 01:27:23.310 position:21% line:83% align:start
to release the limit
on her cursed energy?

01:27:23.443 --> 01:27:24.746 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Geto grunts)

01:27:24.879 --> 01:27:27.148 position:21% line:83% align:start
I never realized you
were such a womanizer.

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:28.649 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't be rude.

01:27:30.184 --> 01:27:31.652 position:27% line:89% align:start
Our love is pure.

01:27:32.419 --> 01:27:33.988 position:16% line:89% align:start
Fine, you fight for love.

01:27:34.122 --> 01:27:36.423 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll fight to win.

01:28:21.135 --> 01:28:22.003 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Geto giggles)

01:28:22.136 --> 01:28:23.503 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's wonderful.

01:28:24.739 --> 01:28:27.608 position:24% line:83% align:start
The whole thing is
absolutely wonderful.

01:28:27.742 --> 01:28:30.845 position:21% line:83% align:start
It truly is the power
to change the world.

01:28:30.978 --> 01:28:33.480 position:21% line:83% align:start
If I had Rika, there
would be no need

01:28:33.614 --> 01:28:36.017 position:30% line:83% align:start
to sneak around
gathering curses.

01:28:36.818 --> 01:28:41.321 position:19% line:83% align:start
Next time, I'll get my
hands on her for sure.

01:28:46.661 --> 01:28:50.631 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're late again
as usual, Satoru.

01:28:51.933 --> 01:28:54.702 position:21% line:83% align:start
To think you'd be the
one here at my end.

01:28:54.836 --> 01:28:57.104 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are you going to make
sure my family is safe?

01:28:57.238 --> 01:29:00.541 position:19% line:83% align:start
Every last one of them
managed to escape to safety.

01:29:00.675 --> 01:29:03.476 position:16% line:83% align:start
The ones in Kyoto, they
were under your command?

01:29:04.212 --> 01:29:05.680 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes, they all were.

01:29:05.813 --> 01:29:09.183 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm a kind person
unlike you, Satoru.

01:29:10.417 --> 01:29:13.054 position:13% line:83% align:start
You sent those two assuming
that I'd defeat them,

01:29:13.187 --> 01:29:14.055 position:35% line:89% align:start
didn't you?

01:29:14.188 --> 01:29:16.257 position:24% line:89% align:start
To set Okkotsu off.

01:29:16.389 --> 01:29:18.491 position:10% line:89% align:start
I trusted you'd be yourself.

01:29:18.626 --> 01:29:20.728 position:24% line:83% align:start
Trusted that a man
as principled as you

01:29:20.862 --> 01:29:24.265 position:19% line:83% align:start
wouldn't kill off young
sorcerers without a reason.

01:29:24.397 --> 01:29:25.333 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Geto chuckles)

01:29:25.465 --> 01:29:27.001 position:13% line:89% align:start
You wanna talk about trust?

01:29:30.905 --> 01:29:33.774 position:21% line:83% align:start
I didn't think I had
any of that left in me,

01:29:33.908 --> 01:29:36.010 position:27% line:83% align:start
after everything
I've been through.

01:29:38.813 --> 01:29:40.615 position:10% line:89% align:start
Return this for me, will you?

01:29:42.917 --> 01:29:46.120 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Satoru] Was the elementary
school your doing, too?

01:29:46.254 --> 01:29:47.521 position:41% line:89% align:start
It was.

01:29:47.655 --> 01:29:49.123 position:21% line:89% align:start
I can't believe you.

01:29:51.025 --> 01:29:53.961 position:30% line:83% align:start
Tell me, do you
have any last words?

01:29:55.029 --> 01:29:59.867 position:13% line:83% align:start
No matter what anyone tells
you, I hate those monkeys.

01:30:01.335 --> 01:30:03.738 position:13% line:89% align:start
But I never held any hatred

01:30:03.871 --> 01:30:06.073 position:33% line:83% align:start
for those in
Jujutsu High School.

01:30:07.041 --> 01:30:09.844 position:21% line:83% align:start
I just couldn't wear
a heartfelt smile

01:30:09.977 --> 01:30:11.712 position:13% line:89% align:start
while living in this world.

01:30:14.515 --> 01:30:16.017 position:41% line:89% align:start
Suguru.

01:30:16.150 --> 01:30:18.920 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

01:30:34.434 --> 01:30:35.736 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Geto chuckles)

01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:38.906 position:16% line:83% align:start
The least you could do is
hit me with some curses.

01:30:53.254 --> 01:30:54.454 position:38% line:89% align:start
(slicing)

01:30:56.791 --> 01:30:59.760 position:21% line:83% align:start
-[Maki] Hey, wake up.
-[Panda] Yuta, Yuta.

01:31:01.329 --> 01:31:03.331 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, Yuta, are you okay?

01:31:03.463 --> 01:31:04.365 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Mustard leaf.

01:31:04.497 --> 01:31:07.034 position:13% line:89% align:start
Come on and wake up, Yuta.

01:31:07.668 --> 01:31:08.970 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

01:31:09.103 --> 01:31:10.237 position:27% line:89% align:start
Good, he's awake.

01:31:11.238 --> 01:31:13.140 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

01:31:13.274 --> 01:31:14.041 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're all here.

01:31:14.175 --> 01:31:16.043 position:27% line:89% align:start
Maki, your okay?

01:31:16.177 --> 01:31:17.178 position:38% line:89% align:start
Inumaki.

01:31:17.311 --> 01:31:19.981 position:24% line:83% align:start
Whoa, Panda, your
arm hasn't healed.

01:31:20.114 --> 01:31:21.349 position:27% line:89% align:start
Chill out, dude.

01:31:21.481 --> 01:31:23.818 position:13% line:83% align:start
We're all doing way better
than you are right now.

01:31:23.951 --> 01:31:26.153 position:7% line:89% align:start
Unlike these other two losers,

01:31:26.287 --> 01:31:27.955 position:13% line:89% align:start
my arm can be fixed later.

01:31:28.089 --> 01:31:30.558 position:24% line:83% align:start
By the way, thanks
for saving us, Yuta.

01:31:30.691 --> 01:31:31.859 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Salmon.

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:33.928 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

01:31:34.061 --> 01:31:35.062 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Rika] Yuta.

01:31:41.535 --> 01:31:42.636 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Panda] Hmm?

01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:44.739 position:19% line:89% align:start
Sorry about that, Rika.

01:31:44.872 --> 01:31:46.474 position:27% line:83% align:start
I didn't mean to
keep you waiting.

01:31:46.607 --> 01:31:48.009 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Panda] What's the matter?

01:31:48.142 --> 01:31:49.143 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yuta?

01:31:49.977 --> 01:31:54.215 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, you see, in exchange
for borrowing her power,

01:31:54.348 --> 01:31:57.551 position:10% line:83% align:start
I kind of promised to go and
live with Rika from now on.

01:31:57.685 --> 01:31:58.853 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Maki] What?
Are you crazy?

01:31:58.986 --> 01:32:00.588 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't you know that means dying?

01:32:00.721 --> 01:32:02.089 position:33% line:83% align:start
What were you
thinking, you idiot?

01:32:02.223 --> 01:32:05.026 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, I was caught off
in the moment, I guess.

01:32:05.159 --> 01:32:06.093 position:33% line:89% align:start
I don't know.

01:32:06.227 --> 01:32:07.328 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:32:07.461 --> 01:32:08.662 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:32:09.463 --> 01:32:10.564 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] Rika?

01:32:10.698 --> 01:32:12.199 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Satoru claps)

01:32:12.333 --> 01:32:13.601 position:27% line:89% align:start
Congratulations.

01:32:13.734 --> 01:32:15.669 position:5% line:89% align:start
You managed to break the curse.

01:32:15.803 --> 01:32:17.138 position:27% line:89% align:start
[All] Who're you?

01:32:17.271 --> 01:32:19.940 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm your good-looking
teacher, Satoru Gojo.

01:32:20.741 --> 01:32:22.343 position:33% line:83% align:start
I thought the
theory Yuta came up

01:32:22.476 --> 01:32:23.878 position:16% line:89% align:start
with sounded interesting.

01:32:24.011 --> 01:32:27.148 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, I requested an investigation
into their families.

01:32:27.281 --> 01:32:28.883 position:27% line:83% align:start
The investigation
about Rika's family

01:32:29.016 --> 01:32:30.918 position:16% line:89% align:start
came to me long time ago,

01:32:31.052 --> 01:32:34.523 position:19% line:83% align:start
but Yuta's history was
full of holes at best.

01:32:34.655 --> 01:32:37.058 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's when it
finally came to light.

01:32:38.025 --> 01:32:40.761 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're the descendant
of Sugawara Michizane,

01:32:40.895 --> 01:32:43.197 position:21% line:83% align:start
which makes us super
distant relatives.

01:32:43.330 --> 01:32:44.198 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Panda And Maki] Suga?

01:32:44.331 --> 01:32:45.566 position:35% line:89% align:start
Who's Suga?

01:32:45.699 --> 01:32:47.468 position:21% line:83% align:start
One of Japan's three
great apparitions.

01:32:47.601 --> 01:32:49.370 position:5% line:89% align:start
He was a super bigshot sorcerer.

01:32:49.503 --> 01:32:50.704 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Toge] Tuna.

01:32:50.838 --> 01:32:52.573 position:24% line:83% align:start
You were right the
whole time, Yuta.

01:32:52.706 --> 01:32:54.909 position:27% line:83% align:start
Rika didn't place
a curse on you.

01:32:55.042 --> 01:32:57.812 position:13% line:89% align:start
You placed a curse on Rika.

01:33:02.517 --> 01:33:04.151 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] Rika, what do I do?

01:33:04.285 --> 01:33:05.419 position:21% line:89% align:start
Is she going to die?

01:33:05.554 --> 01:33:06.887 position:24% line:89% align:start
I have to save her.

01:33:07.021 --> 01:33:10.791 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't die, don't die,
don't die, don't die.

01:33:12.626 --> 01:33:14.028 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

01:33:14.161 --> 01:33:18.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
At the time, I refused
to accept Rika's death.

01:33:18.699 --> 01:33:22.236 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now the one who placed the
curse has canceled the bond.

01:33:23.370 --> 01:33:24.772 position:21% line:89% align:start
As long as the person

01:33:24.905 --> 01:33:27.308 position:13% line:83% align:start
who was cursed doesn't seek
retribution against you,

01:33:27.441 --> 01:33:29.310 position:13% line:89% align:start
the curse is fully broken.

01:33:29.443 --> 01:33:30.811 position:5% line:89% align:start
Of course, that much was obvious

01:33:30.945 --> 01:33:33.047 position:7% line:89% align:start
after seeing her in that form.

01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:35.382 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta cries)

01:33:36.183 --> 01:33:38.219 position:5% line:89% align:start
It was all my fault, wasn't it?

01:33:39.086 --> 01:33:40.955 position:10% line:89% align:start
I turned you into that form.

01:33:42.223 --> 01:33:46.227 position:10% line:83% align:start
I hurt all those people and I
nearly caused everyone to die

01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:48.863 position:16% line:89% align:start
when Geto came after me.

01:33:48.996 --> 01:33:51.765 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's all, it's all my fault.

01:33:52.567 --> 01:33:55.302 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta cries)

01:33:55.436 --> 01:34:00.174 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yuta, thank you for
giving me more time,

01:34:00.307 --> 01:34:03.010 position:30% line:83% align:start
and letting me
stay by your side.

01:34:03.144 --> 01:34:05.246 position:30% line:83% align:start
During the six
years I was cursed,

01:34:05.379 --> 01:34:08.115 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've been happier than
I ever was before.

01:34:09.917 --> 01:34:12.319 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta cries)

01:34:21.962 --> 01:34:23.898 position:21% line:89% align:start
Bye, Yuta, take care.

01:34:27.101 --> 01:34:31.138 position:21% line:83% align:start
And don't cross to my
side anytime soon, okay?

01:34:31.939 --> 01:34:33.340 position:30% line:89% align:start
See you later.

01:34:33.474 --> 01:34:36.076 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gentle music)

01:35:09.210 --> 01:35:11.011 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's a bit late to tell you,

01:35:11.145 --> 01:35:13.948 position:16% line:83% align:start
but you weren't at fault
for the incident with Geto.

01:35:14.081 --> 01:35:15.684 position:21% line:83% align:start
He would've attacked
to Jujutsu High School

01:35:15.816 --> 01:35:17.284 position:10% line:89% align:start
whether you were here or not.

01:35:17.418 --> 01:35:18.553 position:33% line:89% align:start
You think so?

01:35:18.687 --> 01:35:20.454 position:16% line:89% align:start
I believe this is yours.

01:35:20.589 --> 01:35:22.022 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, my student ID.

01:35:22.156 --> 01:35:24.091 position:24% line:83% align:start
Thanks for finding
it for me, Gojo.

01:35:25.492 --> 01:35:28.762 position:27% line:89% align:start
No, it wasn't me.

01:35:28.896 --> 01:35:30.364 position:16% line:89% align:start
My best friend found it.

01:35:31.465 --> 01:35:33.200 position:19% line:89% align:start
My only friend really.

01:35:35.302 --> 01:35:36.270 position:30% line:89% align:start
Come on, Yuta.

01:35:36.403 --> 01:35:38.405 position:27% line:83% align:start
How long are you
gonna keep us waiting?

01:35:39.273 --> 01:35:40.274 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ready to go?

01:35:41.742 --> 01:35:44.579 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Yuta chuckles)

01:35:44.713 --> 01:35:47.414 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gentle music)

01:35:47.549 --> 01:35:48.749 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] Yeah.

01:35:59.728 --> 01:36:04.932 position:21% line:83% align:start
(singing in Japanese)

01:40:43.978 --> 01:40:49.182 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

01:41:08.168 --> 01:41:13.373 position:21% line:83% align:start
(singing in Japanese)

01:43:48.996 --> 01:43:51.933 position:27% line:89% align:start
(birds chirping)

01:43:58.338 --> 01:44:00.942 position:30% line:89% align:start
(horn honking)

01:44:02.043 --> 01:44:04.712 position:30% line:89% align:start
(car whooshing)

01:44:05.546 --> 01:44:08.716 position:24% line:89% align:start
(crowd chattering)

01:44:11.586 --> 01:44:14.387 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Yuta giggles)

01:44:16.356 --> 01:44:17.390 position:33% line:89% align:start
This is good.

01:44:17.525 --> 01:44:19.326 position:21% line:89% align:start
Didn't I tell you so?

01:44:19.459 --> 01:44:21.696 position:27% line:83% align:start
I used this great
spice called Royco.

01:44:21.829 --> 01:44:24.431 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's what gives it
that amazing flavor.

01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:27.168 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:29.070 position:19% line:83% align:start
Royco is a magic powder
that makes every dish taste

01:44:29.203 --> 01:44:31.973 position:24% line:83% align:start
like it was made in
Kenya when you add it in.

01:44:32.106 --> 01:44:35.610 position:10% line:83% align:start
More importantly, they really
went home, didn't they?

01:44:36.577 --> 01:44:37.879 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Yuta groans)

01:44:38.012 --> 01:44:38.913 position:24% line:89% align:start
For that I'm happy.

01:44:39.781 --> 01:44:41.182 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Yuta] This really is good.

01:44:41.314 --> 01:44:43.084 position:19% line:89% align:start
Reminds me of nikujaga.

01:44:43.217 --> 01:44:44.252 position:38% line:89% align:start
Nikujaga?

01:44:44.384 --> 01:44:45.520 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's too hard to pronounce,

01:44:45.653 --> 01:44:47.688 position:24% line:83% align:start
so let's just call
it, beef stew.

01:44:47.822 --> 01:44:49.724 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Miguel giggles)

01:44:49.857 --> 01:44:50.525 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

01:44:50.658 --> 01:44:51.926 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's the matter?

01:44:52.059 --> 01:44:55.462 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Miguel] Well, well,
what are you doing here?

01:44:56.764 --> 01:44:57.765 position:38% line:89% align:start
What the?

01:44:58.933 --> 01:44:59.600 position:44% line:89% align:start
Gojo?

01:44:59.734 --> 01:45:01.836 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey, long time no see.
