1
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:14,987
Yeah?

2
00:02:15,055 --> 00:02:17,038
Mr. Rosso. We've got a job for you.

3
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,022
The Mamma Aiuto gang is on the move.

4
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,280
The Mamma Aiuto gang? I don't know, I'm kind of busy.

5
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,703
We need you to protect one of our
ships that's carrying a fortune in gold.

6
00:02:27,198 --> 00:02:28,157
Is that all?

7
00:02:29,127 --> 00:02:29,714
Well,

8
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:32,510
uh, there's a group of school girls on board, too.

9
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:35,354
Now that is going to cost you.

10
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:39,475
See here, bounty hunter, no price
gouging. We've got a contract with you.

11
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:40,993
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm on it.

12
00:02:42,957 --> 00:02:43,830
Stop the ship!

13
00:02:44,276 --> 00:02:47,112
Stop the ship or we'll sink it! You hear me, idiots?

14
00:02:47,128 --> 00:02:51,602
Look at that! Seaplane pirates!

15
00:03:17,677 --> 00:03:21,052
Someday I'm gonna get off my lazy
butt and give this thing an overhaul.

16
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,786
Are you seaplane pirates?

17
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:55,788
Yeah, that's right.

18
00:03:55,984 --> 00:03:57,756
So we're your hostages?

19
00:03:57,772 --> 00:03:58,916
That's right, too.

20
00:03:58,932 --> 00:04:00,735
It smells like you never bathe.

21
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:01,721
You know you're sharp!

22
00:04:01,737 --> 00:04:02,691
How cute!

23
00:04:02,707 --> 00:04:04,160
Could use some blood.

24
00:04:04,415 --> 00:04:07,496
Hey! Hey! Come on, kids. We're in a hurry!

25
00:04:07,649 --> 00:04:10,530
Boss, do we have to take all 15 of them?

26
00:04:10,546 --> 00:04:13,650
Yeah, it's not nice to separate them from their friends.

27
00:04:32,618 --> 00:04:33,570
Looks like I'm late.

28
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,217
Porco, hurry!

29
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,695
The Mamma Aiuto gang have taken the girls and the gold.

30
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,782
They went that way! They went that way!

31
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:52,630
No! Not that way! Wrong way! Wrong way!

32
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:55,250
Calm down. I know what I'm doing.

33
00:04:55,678 --> 00:04:57,865
That Mamma Aiuto gang is so cheap,

34
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:02,901
they'll fly till they're just out of sight, then hide
on the nearest island, Just to save money on gasoline.

35
00:05:06,854 --> 00:05:07,336
Damn.

36
00:05:08,213 --> 00:05:09,598
Don't give out on me now.

37
00:05:16,311 --> 00:05:18,572
Come on, baby. Come on.

38
00:05:19,495 --> 00:05:21,709
Yeah. That's my girl.

39
00:05:32,103 --> 00:05:35,224
That can't be good. I better get this job done quick.

40
00:05:38,859 --> 00:05:39,648
There they are.

41
00:05:50,655 --> 00:05:53,283
What the heck is this, a sightseeing plane?

42
00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:54,865
This is pirate country.

43
00:05:56,049 --> 00:05:57,606
They know better than to be out here.

44
00:05:57,622 --> 00:05:59,600
Porco Rosso!

45
00:06:02,143 --> 00:06:03,596
I can't believe it. I love you, Porco!

46
00:06:03,612 --> 00:06:04,974
Hey, girls, get out of here.

47
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,847
You can get yourselves kidnapped
in these skies, sweethearts.

48
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:26,954
What's this?

49
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,496
Looks like we're safe.

50
00:06:28,872 --> 00:06:30,791
Hey, look, we're flying!

51
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,809
What's going on down there?

52
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,796
Now, girls, this is not a playground.

53
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,886
Hey, can't you shut them up?

54
00:06:37,902 --> 00:06:40,380
I told you that we shouldn't have taken them all.

55
00:06:41,327 --> 00:06:42,170
My nose!

56
00:06:42,313 --> 00:06:43,163
Can we come up?

57
00:06:43,179 --> 00:06:44,116
Yeah, all right.

58
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,107
Just don't let the boss know.

59
00:06:46,123 --> 00:06:46,752
Wow.

60
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,348
Great view.

61
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:51,687
Hey, look! What a pretty red plane.

62
00:06:51,948 --> 00:06:53,560
What? Where?

63
00:06:53,584 --> 00:06:54,857
That was Porco.

64
00:06:55,087 --> 00:06:56,032
Yeah.

65
00:07:00,244 --> 00:07:02,632
All right. Let's get this thing over with.

66
00:07:04,665 --> 00:07:05,841
He's back!

67
00:07:06,974 --> 00:07:08,088
It is Porco!

68
00:07:08,104 --> 00:07:08,690
Cut it out!

69
00:07:08,706 --> 00:07:08,896
I can't see.

70
00:07:12,347 --> 00:07:13,348
Ha-ha!

71
00:07:14,004 --> 00:07:15,695
Uh... That's not good.

72
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:16,546
The engine stopped.

73
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:17,866
We're gonna crash.

74
00:07:17,882 --> 00:07:20,248
No, we're not! We've got another engine.

75
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:27,310
Hey! Don't just sit there! Shoot him! Shoot him!

76
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:30,155
You keep missing him.

77
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,741
I think he's better than you.

78
00:07:35,757 --> 00:07:36,413
Quiet down.

79
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:45,366
Signal from the pig.

80
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,473
"Surrender now. You lose, jerks."

81
00:07:47,489 --> 00:07:48,035
Never!

82
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:54,955
Here he comes. I'll get him this time.

83
00:07:57,302 --> 00:07:57,656
Whe..

84
00:07:57,735 --> 00:07:58,148
Wow!

85
00:07:58,164 --> 00:07:58,796
Where'd he go?

86
00:07:58,817 --> 00:07:59,206
Oh, He's great.

87
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:00,197
He's hiding.

88
00:08:11,638 --> 00:08:13,139
Help! Help!

89
00:08:13,155 --> 00:08:15,633
We're gonna sink! Let's get out of here.

90
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:18,652
We're not gonna sink. This is a seaplane!

91
00:08:19,177 --> 00:08:20,748
No, no, no!

92
00:08:23,196 --> 00:08:24,188
That's not good.

93
00:08:25,188 --> 00:08:26,246
We're sinking!

94
00:08:26,634 --> 00:08:28,535
Stop them! They're valuable hostages!

95
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:29,493
Get back inside!

96
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,720
Girls, out of the water! It's dangerous!

97
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:35,612
Don't worry. We all belong to a swimming club. Watch this.

98
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:37,140
No! No! No! Don't do it!

99
00:08:37,156 --> 00:08:37,934
Whee!

100
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:39,468
Signal from the pig!

101
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:40,698
Hey, watch me, too!

102
00:08:40,714 --> 00:08:46,526
He says, "Hand over the girls and the gold, and I'll
let you keep some loot so you can repair your ship."

103
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,922
I'd hate to put you jerks out of business.

104
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:50,654
We get to keep some.

105
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,557
That's generous.

106
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:56,491
We're not giving in, you idiots!
Come and get it, pig! I dare you!

107
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:02,578
Gotcha.

108
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,215
Uh-oh.

109
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:06,162
My gun's jammed!

110
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:06,371
Wait, that's not good!

111
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,118
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

112
00:09:07,134 --> 00:09:08,934
We surrender! We surrender!

113
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:10,586
Nice pig! Nice pig!

114
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:18,488
Bye-bye, pirates! Bye-bye!

115
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:20,031
So that worked out well.

116
00:09:20,047 --> 00:09:21,997
It's really nice of him not to kill us.

117
00:09:22,748 --> 00:09:25,115
Show more ambition! You're a pirate!

118
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:31,605
Porco, I gotta go peepee.

119
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:32,406
Come on.

120
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:32,723
What?

121
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,366
Come get me.

122
00:09:33,382 --> 00:09:34,756
Hey, get out of here!

123
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:39,562
Wait, don't touch that! You're...
Hey, get down from there! Don't...

124
00:09:39,608 --> 00:09:40,962
Put your clothes back on!

125
00:09:40,978 --> 00:09:42,327
Whee!

126
00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:44,774
Hey! All right, get down!

127
00:09:48,615 --> 00:09:51,343
"Another triumph for Porco Rosso."

128
00:09:51,853 --> 00:09:54,738
It's a good thing we pirates are banding together, eh?

129
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,829
We've got to do something about that stupid pig.

130
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:02,189
So, your American here can help us?

131
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:05,590
The pirates of the Adriatic
can't have an American protect them.

132
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:06,528
That's embarrassing.

133
00:10:06,544 --> 00:10:10,356
No, it's not. Look at him. His
grandma's cousin was Italian.

134
00:10:10,451 --> 00:10:14,609
And besides, Curtis is the only pilot
who can beat Porco. And for 10% he can...

135
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,666
10%? I'm not going to pay that.

136
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:17,637
Shh.

137
00:10:20,113 --> 00:10:22,671
Quand nous chanterons

138
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,363
le temps des cerises

139
00:10:25,623 --> 00:10:27,893
et gai rossignol

140
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:30,493
et Merle moqueur

141
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:37,330
seront tous en fete!

142
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:40,451
Les belles auront

143
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:44,628
La folie en tete

144
00:10:45,742 --> 00:10:52,095
et les amoureux, de soleil au coeur!

145
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,766
Quand nous chanterons

146
00:10:54,892 --> 00:10:57,601
le temps des cerises

147
00:10:57,871 --> 00:11:01,002
sifflera bien mieux

148
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,071
le Merle moqueur!

149
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:09,768
Mais il est bien court

150
00:11:09,784 --> 00:11:12,328
le temps des cerises

151
00:11:12,344 --> 00:11:17,439
ou l'on s'en va deux cueillir en revant

152
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:23,654
des pendants d'oreilles

153
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:29,623
cerises d'amour aux robes pareilles.

154
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:30,354
Here you go.

155
00:11:31,894 --> 00:11:32,380
Good evening.

156
00:11:32,396 --> 00:11:35,015
tombant sous la feuille

157
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:39,431
en gouttes de sang

158
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:43,532
mais il est bien court

159
00:11:43,945 --> 00:11:46,647
le temps des cerises

160
00:11:46,703 --> 00:11:55,153
pendents de corail - qu-on cueille revants.

161
00:12:01,073 --> 00:12:01,615
The pig's here.

162
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:02,615
Look what's waddling in.

163
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,283
...sensation like that...

164
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:06,691
Shh!

165
00:12:08,614 --> 00:12:08,864
Usual.

166
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,195
J'aimerai toujours

167
00:12:11,545 --> 00:12:13,866
le temps des cerises

168
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,534
c'est de ce temps la

169
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:20,148
que je garde au couer...

170
00:12:20,164 --> 00:12:24,177
Mr. Rosso! Congratulations on
defeating the Mamma Aiuto gang again.

171
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:28,046
Did you know you've taken in twice the
reward of any bounty hunter this year?

172
00:12:28,062 --> 00:12:32,027
And, sir, how does it feel to be
the top bounty hunter in the Adriatic?

173
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:32,861
And let me ask...

174
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:37,788
Hey! What do you think you're doing? Get your hands off...

175
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,726
Shut up and listen to the song.

176
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,759
Yes, Sir.

177
00:12:50,085 --> 00:12:51,801
She sure is incredible.

178
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:54,490
I just might have to take her back home with me.

179
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:56,892
I bet she could make it big in America.

180
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,743
Although, she will have to stop
singing in French all the time, of course.

181
00:13:01,428 --> 00:13:03,445
Hey, cowboy, is that your plane out front?

182
00:13:03,687 --> 00:13:07,750
Yep. I don't mind saying she made me a
bit of a celebrity in the racing world.

183
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,866
So you're the one who beat the
Italians in the Schneider Cup.

184
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:15,036
That's right. But what I'm best at is aerial combat.

185
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:19,866
These pirates tell me that you got a
pretty good reputation in the skies.

186
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,880
I'd be careful if you plan on
making a deal with those pirate gangs.

187
00:13:24,082 --> 00:13:26,223
Not only are they lying cheapskates,

188
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:28,615
not a single one of them knows how to bathe.

189
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:31,311
That's for sure.

190
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:33,612
Hey! We heard that, you stupid pig.

191
00:13:33,628 --> 00:13:34,796
Well, look at this.

192
00:13:34,812 --> 00:13:37,306
All you handsome pirate bosses at one table.

193
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,443
You're not here to cause problems, are you?

194
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:39,687
Never.

195
00:13:39,702 --> 00:13:40,578
Not us.

196
00:13:40,594 --> 00:13:44,446
You know my rule. You eat in my restaurant, not fight.

197
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:48,578
Of course, Gina. We would never
fight within 50 miles of your place.

198
00:13:49,275 --> 00:13:52,047
We're even getting along with the pig. Aren't we?

199
00:13:52,063 --> 00:13:52,996
Mmm-hmm.

200
00:13:54,744 --> 00:13:55,807
Be good, boys.

201
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,072
Wish me luck.

202
00:14:04,623 --> 00:14:05,532
May I help you?

203
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:06,825
Back off, Curtis!

204
00:14:06,841 --> 00:14:07,329
Hey!

205
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,685
Porco, tell me about your rescue.

206
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:11,583
Next time, when it's just the two of us.

207
00:14:20,556 --> 00:14:22,355
Eating all alone up here again?

208
00:14:23,134 --> 00:14:25,786
So, what do you think of that American fly boy?

209
00:14:25,802 --> 00:14:27,146
He's something else, isn't he?

210
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:30,838
As soon as he saw me, he asked me to marry him.

211
00:14:30,977 --> 00:14:33,547
So I told him of the three pilots I've married,

212
00:14:33,563 --> 00:14:36,569
the first died in the war,
the second died in the Atlantic,

213
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,142
the last one, he died in Asia.

214
00:14:41,655 --> 00:14:42,836
So you've heard something.

215
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:45,792
I got the call last night.

216
00:14:46,034 --> 00:14:49,137
They found his remains in some remote part of Bengal.

217
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:51,133
It's strange, Marco.

218
00:14:51,617 --> 00:14:55,612
I've been waiting to hear something
for three years, but now I can't even cry.

219
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:59,855
I just feel numb. Maybe I've run out of tears.

220
00:15:01,181 --> 00:15:03,199
Yeah, well, the good guys always die.

221
00:15:04,177 --> 00:15:06,419
Cheers. To a good man.

222
00:15:06,925 --> 00:15:09,920
Marco, I want to thank you for keeping an eye on me

223
00:15:10,604 --> 00:15:13,289
and my restaurant all these years.

224
00:15:16,856 --> 00:15:19,812
I just can't tell you how much
your friendship means to me.

225
00:15:21,582 --> 00:15:26,613
Well, you know, it's a great place, except for that
ugly photograph you keep hanging on the wall up there.

226
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,356
Hey, that's my favorite picture.

227
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:32,192
I can't believe you scribbled over your face.

228
00:15:32,372 --> 00:15:34,750
That's the only picture left of you as a human.

229
00:15:36,153 --> 00:15:39,873
How are you ever going to break
that stupid curse on you, Marco?

230
00:15:41,267 --> 00:15:43,726
Face it. I'm a pig.

231
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,767
That American's gonna be trouble.

232
00:16:18,168 --> 00:16:20,972
Hey, that's Porco Rosso. Let's alert the captain.

233
00:16:29,463 --> 00:16:31,008
I'd like it only in 20s, please.

234
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,310
Yes, ma'am.

235
00:16:32,334 --> 00:16:36,622
I envy you, Mr. Rosso. I wish I
could make money the way you do.

236
00:16:37,395 --> 00:16:38,681
Here's this month's payment.

237
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,230
That's the last you owe on the seaplane.

238
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:42,272
Let's see.

239
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:46,506
How about buying some patriotic
bonds, to help serve our nation?

240
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:49,400
Sorry, I'm a pig. I'll leave that to you humans.

241
00:17:06,245 --> 00:17:08,370
Hey, there, Mr. Rosso. We've got your gun ready.

242
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,858
Give me some ammo, too, Kid.

243
00:17:10,874 --> 00:17:11,412
Yes, Sir.

244
00:17:13,586 --> 00:17:15,421
A lot of commotion in the streets.

245
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:19,728
Sure is. Looks like our islands
are in for a change of government.

246
00:17:20,128 --> 00:17:23,041
If so, you bounty hunters will soon be outlaws.

247
00:17:23,703 --> 00:17:25,544
Laws don't mean anything to a pig.

248
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:30,390
That's a good point. They don't
mean much to us weapons dealers either.

249
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:34,102
Here are the bullets. Are you sure you want the usual?

250
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:36,596
We've got new armor-piercing ones that explode on contact.

251
00:17:36,726 --> 00:17:40,996
Hey. Easy, kid, I'm just a bounty
hunter. I'm not fighting a war.

252
00:17:42,045 --> 00:17:42,680
Come again!

253
00:17:45,247 --> 00:17:48,698
So what's the difference between
fighting a war and bounty hunting?

254
00:17:49,008 --> 00:17:51,160
If you make money from war, you're scum.

255
00:17:51,341 --> 00:17:54,377
But if you can't make money from
bounty hunting, you're an idiot.

256
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:00,546
How in the world can we be in debt? This is ridiculous!

257
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:02,063
We miscalculated.

258
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:05,379
We didn't take quite enough money to cover our repairs.

259
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:07,296
The other pirates are here.

260
00:18:13,655 --> 00:18:17,923
Man, this is embarrassing. I can't
believe we have to work with these losers.

261
00:18:17,939 --> 00:18:20,149
It's the stupid pig's fault, boss.

262
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:23,902
Look at that. Those Mamma Aiuto
guys can't even afford paint.

263
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,427
It's embarrassing to be seen with them.

264
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:28,659
All right, I guess we're all here.

265
00:18:29,062 --> 00:18:32,313
Hey, you in back. What happened to our Mr. America?

266
00:18:32,735 --> 00:18:34,429
He's flying in the sun.

267
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:36,249
Typical American.

268
00:18:44,898 --> 00:18:46,065
Target sighted.

269
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:48,148
Queen of the Mediterranean at 10 o'clock.

270
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:50,859
That ship's kind of big, isn't it?

271
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,616
That's why we're doing this as
a group. Don't be such a sissy!

272
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:59,024
We're having engine trouble.
You go on ahead, we'll back you up.

273
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:02,165
Don't try to chicken out! We stick to the plan!

274
00:19:02,248 --> 00:19:05,627
We share the cost of repairs if one of us gets hit, right?

275
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:10,221
No, you babies! Everyone is
responsible for his own expenses!

276
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:11,816
Even for the ammo?

277
00:19:11,832 --> 00:19:13,182
What do you think?

278
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,462
We're having engine trouble.

279
00:19:15,478 --> 00:19:17,164
No, we're having engine trouble.

280
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,203
Engine trouble here.

281
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:21,684
Shut up, you sissies! Let's get fighting!

282
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,816
Attention, all passengers.

283
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:30,568
We are now being attacked by seaplane pirates.

284
00:19:30,652 --> 00:19:32,320
Do not be concerned.

285
00:19:32,403 --> 00:19:34,921
The Queen of the Mediterranean cruise line

286
00:19:35,095 --> 00:19:37,120
has anticipated this possibility,

287
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,861
and has equipped our ship with
two top-of-the-line fighter pilots.

288
00:19:41,454 --> 00:19:44,657
Now launching, from the main deck, in plane number one,

289
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:45,636
the Black Stallion, Signore Bulkar.

290
00:19:45,658 --> 00:19:47,865
Thank you! Thank you!

291
00:19:48,206 --> 00:19:52,890
And in plane number two, the
Wolf of Tibere, Captain Visconti.

292
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:55,450
Go get 'em, boys!

293
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:00,932
Go get 'em!

294
00:20:03,806 --> 00:20:05,589
I didn't know they had security.

295
00:20:05,821 --> 00:20:06,772
No!

296
00:20:14,654 --> 00:20:17,414
Oh, they're panicking. I'll have to win this thing myself.

297
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,099
Get off me! Help! Curtis!

298
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,601
Make way for the American!

299
00:20:23,241 --> 00:20:25,065
Yee-haw!

300
00:20:40,555 --> 00:20:41,809
All right, I give up.

301
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:46,415
I'm gonna have to take this baby to Milan for repairs.

302
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:53,260
And with the help of American Donald Curtis,

303
00:20:53,276 --> 00:20:54,736
the air pirates shot down

304
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:57,572
the Queen of the Mediterranean's two security planes.

305
00:20:57,655 --> 00:21:00,059
After stealing all the valuables from the ship,

306
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:02,577
the pirates left the following message.

307
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,398
We're coming for
you,

308
00:21:04,944 --> 00:21:06,510
Porco Rosso!

309
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,313
Get off me!

310
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:11,386
I repeat, "We're coming for you, Porco Rosso...

311
00:21:11,413 --> 00:21:13,628
Argh. Ack. Argh. Get off me."

312
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:16,637
You really expect me to wait here?

313
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:24,924
Forget it. I'm off to Milan.

314
00:21:25,197 --> 00:21:30,001
Luscious food, a soft bed, beautiful women.

315
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:36,859
There we go.

316
00:21:37,742 --> 00:21:41,046
Come on, baby. Just hold out until Milan.

317
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:09,383
I don't like this weather. I better duck below the clouds.

318
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:08,627
Come on. Come on, girl. Come on.

319
00:23:11,565 --> 00:23:14,605
That's it. That's right. Just stay with me, baby.

320
00:23:25,887 --> 00:23:27,345
Porco!

321
00:23:27,438 --> 00:23:27,835
What?

322
00:23:36,168 --> 00:23:38,284
Fight me, pig! One-on-one.

323
00:23:38,356 --> 00:23:40,150
No, thanks, Tex. I'm kind of busy.

324
00:23:48,576 --> 00:23:51,996
If you run away, I'll tell everyone you're a chicken.

325
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,339
Chicken, pig, what's the difference?

326
00:23:57,485 --> 00:23:59,374
Whoa. I'm out in the open.

327
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,027
Oh, come on, baby.

328
00:24:03,883 --> 00:24:05,071
I hit the pig!

329
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:08,207
You didn't hit anything. My engine died, you idiot.

330
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:23,692
He's down! I'm a bona fide celebrity. Yahoo!

331
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:43,649
I need some evidence or no one will believe me.

332
00:24:44,295 --> 00:24:46,364
Let's see. Ooh.

333
00:24:52,597 --> 00:24:53,664
Gotcha!

334
00:25:11,048 --> 00:25:13,945
Obnoxious red paint. That's proof.

335
00:25:15,371 --> 00:25:18,223
I might just take it back to Texas as a gift for Ma.

336
00:26:02,317 --> 00:26:05,643
Hurry, it's an emergency. Marco's been shot down.

337
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:10,385
Wait, Miss Gina!

338
00:26:11,182 --> 00:26:12,634
There's a phone call for you!

339
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:15,842
Porco's alive! He's on the phone right now!

340
00:26:18,116 --> 00:26:21,580
You can take it at the front desk. Hey! Wait!

341
00:26:28,173 --> 00:26:29,714
Marco, are you all right?

342
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:32,541
I was just about to go and search for you in my boat.

343
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:34,217
I'm fine. A tugboat gave me a lift.

344
00:26:34,868 --> 00:26:35,948
Thank God.

345
00:26:36,014 --> 00:26:38,720
And I've slimmed down, marooned on an island for two days.

346
00:26:38,882 --> 00:26:40,311
So ll look pretty good.

347
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:43,343
Although, not as sexy as that American fly boy.

348
00:26:43,867 --> 00:26:46,848
I'm sure he'll be stopping by your
place. So tell him we'll meet again.

349
00:26:47,804 --> 00:26:49,866
Anyway, I'm off to Milan to fix my plane.

350
00:26:49,882 --> 00:26:52,519
You're in Italy? You idiot!

351
00:26:52,593 --> 00:26:55,596
The Italians have a warrant out for your arrest, remember?

352
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:00,123
I don't care how great your mechanic is
over there. You get back home, you hear me?

353
00:27:00,139 --> 00:27:01,492
I don't want to yell at you, Marco.

354
00:27:01,644 --> 00:27:04,882
But if you keep acting so
pig-headed, you're going to end up dead,

355
00:27:05,085 --> 00:27:07,513
and I can't bear to go to another pilot's funeral.

356
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:08,863
Come home, will you?

357
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,384
Sorry, baby. Got to fly.

358
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,501
You jerk!

359
00:27:27,128 --> 00:27:29,402
"Is Porco Rosso dead or alive?"

360
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:31,102
Good question.

361
00:28:06,673 --> 00:28:10,070
Hey, Porco, I thought you would
come here tonight, so I waited up.

362
00:28:10,086 --> 00:28:11,690
She really took a beating this time.

363
00:28:11,762 --> 00:28:14,034
It looks like you're missing half of the plane.

364
00:28:14,272 --> 00:28:16,797
Wouldn't it be easier to build a new one?

365
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:18,548
I'm attached to this one.

366
00:28:19,175 --> 00:28:21,789
All right. It's your money.

367
00:28:21,805 --> 00:28:24,377
Hey. Look out, I'm gonna back her in, okay?

368
00:28:28,025 --> 00:28:30,535
So, tell me, Piccolo, where'd you find the girl?

369
00:28:30,606 --> 00:28:32,615
That's my granddaughter from America.

370
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:39,398
Keep coming, keep coming. Yeah, that's good.

371
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:57,148
Wow.

372
00:28:57,426 --> 00:28:59,982
Gorgeous fuselage, isn't it, Grandpa?

373
00:29:01,168 --> 00:29:02,248
Great lines.

374
00:29:02,332 --> 00:29:05,938
Not many workers around who
can do a job like this these days.

375
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,345
Well, there's no resemblance.

376
00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:08,421
Mmm?

377
00:29:08,437 --> 00:29:10,595
Are you sure that girl's your granddaughter, Piccolo?

378
00:29:10,848 --> 00:29:12,198
Keep away from her.

379
00:29:15,747 --> 00:29:18,197
Fio, you all right getting the plane off the rig?

380
00:29:18,213 --> 00:29:19,344
Sure, no problem.

381
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:23,974
I've got to outfly an American named
Curtis, or my business is in the toilet.

382
00:29:23,994 --> 00:29:26,626
Curtis, huh? I've got just what you need.

383
00:29:32,211 --> 00:29:33,254
What do you think?

384
00:29:33,337 --> 00:29:35,135
This would give me some extra kick.

385
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:36,775
Don't ask how I got it.

386
00:29:37,174 --> 00:29:43,023
All I can say is that it came from an Italian
seaplane that lost the Schneider Cup to Curtis in 1927.

387
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:47,090
But it wasn't the engine's
fault. The mechanic was an idiot.

388
00:29:48,406 --> 00:29:49,928
I'll tune this up just right.

389
00:29:50,435 --> 00:29:52,520
But don't tune it up too delicately.

390
00:29:52,627 --> 00:29:54,733
I'm not flying this thing in a race, you know.

391
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:59,491
Hey, you're talking to the god
of engine work here. Trust me.

392
00:30:03,242 --> 00:30:05,363
You plan on taking all of my money?

393
00:30:05,955 --> 00:30:07,612
Quit whining.

394
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:11,074
These days, money's barely
worth the paper it's printed on.

395
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:12,877
You're coming up short.

396
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,556
Give me the money you've got in your pockets.

397
00:30:14,588 --> 00:30:18,384
I need that. I've got to pay for
meals, a hotel room, more meals.

398
00:30:18,412 --> 00:30:21,751
You can stay here. Meals
included. I won't charge you much.

399
00:30:24,392 --> 00:30:27,131
So, Piccolo, I haven't seen your
sons around. Are they all right?

400
00:30:27,149 --> 00:30:28,942
They took off to find work.

401
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:31,414
They took off? Then who's going to design my plane?

402
00:30:31,575 --> 00:30:32,826
Fio will do it.

403
00:30:32,974 --> 00:30:35,893
Fio? That cute little girl?

404
00:30:36,025 --> 00:30:37,334
Don't be such a pig.

405
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:40,415
She's a talented engineer, even better than my sons.

406
00:30:44,515 --> 00:30:46,460
No dice, pal, I need a professional.

407
00:30:46,476 --> 00:30:49,685
I'm taking my worthless money somewhere else. Sorry.

408
00:30:51,452 --> 00:30:52,100
Wait!

409
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:02,195
Are you leaving because I'm a
woman? Or is it because I'm too young?

410
00:31:02,744 --> 00:31:04,287
Actually, it's both, kiddo.

411
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,408
Okay. That's fair.

412
00:31:08,214 --> 00:31:11,628
But tell me what you think it takes to make a pilot great.

413
00:31:12,561 --> 00:31:13,686
Experience?

414
00:31:14,804 --> 00:31:16,148
No, it's intuition.

415
00:31:16,514 --> 00:31:19,048
I just knew you weren't gonna say experience.

416
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:23,830
Grandpa said you flew solo your first week
and were a great pilot right from the very start.

417
00:31:24,201 --> 00:31:25,245
Isn't that true?

418
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,072
Hmm.

419
00:31:28,122 --> 00:31:31,045
Yeah, but that was in 1910, when I was 17.

420
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:34,635
Seventeen? That's the same age I am.

421
00:31:35,464 --> 00:31:40,013
I can't help being a woman, but
I guarantee you I have the talent.

422
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,951
If I don't do a good job, you don't have to pay.

423
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:43,883
Okay, Grandpa?

424
00:31:44,368 --> 00:31:46,679
She's my granddaughter, she'll do fine.

425
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,802
Now with me, I was fixing engines at the age of 12.

426
00:31:51,018 --> 00:31:56,474
Why don't you sleep on it? That's your bed. Breakfast
is at 7:00. I've left you a clean towel in the bathroom.

427
00:31:56,526 --> 00:31:57,206
Good night!

428
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:05,424
You still don't have enough, but since you're a
good friend, I've decided to loan you the rest.

429
00:32:50,589 --> 00:32:52,675
Good morning. Did you sleep well?

430
00:32:52,703 --> 00:32:53,825
You were up all night?

431
00:32:54,262 --> 00:32:55,978
Here's a rough draft of the design.

432
00:32:56,537 --> 00:32:57,612
So what do you think?

433
00:32:59,495 --> 00:33:03,512
I tweaked the wing section a bit, which should
make the plane fly at least five knots faster.

434
00:33:04,261 --> 00:33:08,603
Look, I dug up the original blueprints.
The design is really radical, huh?

435
00:33:09,345 --> 00:33:13,220
Wooden monocoque wings, with extreme angles of incidence.

436
00:33:13,462 --> 00:33:15,130
I've never seen anything like it.

437
00:33:17,126 --> 00:33:20,609
Yeah, they only made one, then
they decided it was too dangerous.

438
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:22,110
No pilot could fly it.

439
00:33:23,933 --> 00:33:25,873
I found it covered in dust in a warehouse.

440
00:33:25,889 --> 00:33:27,040
I can see why.

441
00:33:27,361 --> 00:33:31,234
With the wings angled like that, I'm really
surprised you could even get it off the water.

442
00:33:32,044 --> 00:33:34,324
Takeoffs and landings can be a little bit tricky.

443
00:33:34,582 --> 00:33:37,041
But get her up to speed, and she handles like a dream.

444
00:33:38,108 --> 00:33:41,990
Why don't you try increasing the angle
of incidence by half a degree on the wing?

445
00:33:43,003 --> 00:33:43,896
The rest looks fine.

446
00:33:44,517 --> 00:33:48,187
So you're giving me the job?
Oh, thank you for trusting a woman.

447
00:33:49,922 --> 00:33:52,891
All right, you've got the job. But on one condition, Fio.

448
00:33:54,415 --> 00:33:57,864
No more staying up all night, or
your work will start getting sloppy.

449
00:33:58,355 --> 00:34:00,295
Also, it's really bad for your complexion.

450
00:34:01,634 --> 00:34:02,452
You got it.

451
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:07,287
To be honest, I couldn't sleep last night
because I was afraid you wouldn't give me the job.

452
00:34:07,491 --> 00:34:08,742
I should sleep fine tonight.

453
00:34:09,091 --> 00:34:11,696
I'll go make us some coffee,
and then I'll get back to work.

454
00:34:11,854 --> 00:34:14,856
This is so exciting! I can't wait to start building.

455
00:34:17,049 --> 00:34:20,759
Don't tell me that she plans on
building the whole plane by herself.

456
00:34:29,466 --> 00:34:31,146
This is my niece, Monica.

457
00:34:31,162 --> 00:34:31,927
Nice to meet you.

458
00:34:32,078 --> 00:34:34,222
This is Silvana, my other niece,

459
00:34:34,276 --> 00:34:38,884
and her four daughters, Sophia,
Laura, Constance, Valentina.

460
00:34:39,017 --> 00:34:41,186
Fio's big sister, Giliora.

461
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,023
Sandra! She's my cousin.

462
00:34:43,103 --> 00:34:45,001
Marietta, good to see you.

463
00:34:45,337 --> 00:34:50,165
My sons' wives, Maria, Tina, Anna.
And the three old hags showed up.

464
00:34:50,279 --> 00:34:52,214
Porcellino!

465
00:34:54,777 --> 00:34:56,490
Are you girls really still alive?

466
00:34:58,287 --> 00:35:01,206
You bet. We thought we'd get in on the action.

467
00:35:03,913 --> 00:35:05,952
You're not here to help build my plane, are you?

468
00:35:07,234 --> 00:35:09,368
Yeah. We need to get some poker money.

469
00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:17,307
So, this is the crew, huh.

470
00:35:19,122 --> 00:35:21,850
Uh, don't you have any male relatives?

471
00:35:22,144 --> 00:35:23,892
All the men are gone.

472
00:35:23,974 --> 00:35:25,861
They had to look elsewhere for work.

473
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,139
This is work. Get them back.

474
00:35:30,439 --> 00:35:35,605
Women are great. Don't be such a pig.
You'll see, they're very hard workers.

475
00:35:35,748 --> 00:35:37,908
Yeah, but we're not baking a cake here.

476
00:35:47,127 --> 00:35:48,329
Heavenly Father,

477
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:51,039
we give you thanks for putting bread on our table,

478
00:35:51,214 --> 00:35:54,358
and for giving us work when we
were on the brink of bankruptcy.

479
00:35:55,004 --> 00:35:58,300
Please forgive us for building a
fighter plane with the hands of women.

480
00:35:58,764 --> 00:36:00,120
Amen.

481
00:36:02,486 --> 00:36:05,505
We'll eat, then work on baking that cake.

482
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:07,722
This is here.

483
00:36:15,898 --> 00:36:18,832
You're going to whip the pants off Curtis with this.

484
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:28,179
What do you think? Too delicate?

485
00:36:28,632 --> 00:36:31,730
I think this might be bad for your shed, Piccolo.

486
00:36:32,535 --> 00:36:35,740
Yeah? Wait till we turn it up to full speed.

487
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:09,468
Hmm. You want to add a trim tab?

488
00:37:09,507 --> 00:37:11,159
Yeah, can I?

489
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,717
I don't know. This is going to cost a lot of money.

490
00:37:16,076 --> 00:37:19,639
It's a great idea, but we've already gone way over budget.

491
00:37:20,587 --> 00:37:22,291
See what the client thinks.

492
00:37:24,323 --> 00:37:25,111
Porco?

493
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:30,513
Would you stop looking at me like that, Fio?

494
00:37:30,731 --> 00:37:31,928
Just do what's best.

495
00:37:31,944 --> 00:37:34,760
That's great! I've already talked to the manufacturers.

496
00:37:34,776 --> 00:37:36,361
I can get the order filled right away.

497
00:37:36,484 --> 00:37:37,776
I love you, Porco!

498
00:37:42,196 --> 00:37:44,090
I'll give you three months to pay the bill.

499
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:46,528
Maybe I should just become an air pirate.

500
00:37:47,247 --> 00:37:48,385
You like Fio?

501
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:48,812
Hmm?

502
00:37:49,479 --> 00:37:50,670
Don't touch her.

503
00:37:51,507 --> 00:37:54,053
Don't worry. Just looking at her makes me tired.

504
00:39:07,751 --> 00:39:10,732
Ferrari, look at you. You're a major now.

505
00:39:10,795 --> 00:39:13,589
Marco, you're crazy. What are you doing back in Italy?

506
00:39:13,613 --> 00:39:15,698
I make it a rule to come and go as I please.

507
00:39:16,514 --> 00:39:18,835
The secret police already know you're in the country.

508
00:39:19,297 --> 00:39:20,457
Were you followed?

509
00:39:20,841 --> 00:39:22,038
I gave them the slip.

510
00:39:22,173 --> 00:39:24,136
You've got to get out of Italy now.

511
00:39:24,191 --> 00:39:27,019
I've seen your arrest warrant,
deserting the Italian Air Force,

512
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:31,832
entering the country illegally,
being a blatantly unpatriotic pig.

513
00:39:33,316 --> 00:39:35,111
This is no time to laugh, Marco.

514
00:39:35,897 --> 00:39:38,993
They've got it in for you. They
want to confiscate your plane.

515
00:39:40,535 --> 00:39:42,104
Man, this movie stinks.

516
00:39:42,487 --> 00:39:45,156
Marco, why don't you come back to the Air Force?

517
00:39:45,335 --> 00:39:47,901
I've got influence now. I could work something out.

518
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:51,307
Thanks for the offer, but I'd
rather be a pig than a fascist.

519
00:39:51,518 --> 00:39:53,800
Then you better keep your plane out of the skies.

520
00:39:54,201 --> 00:39:57,626
The only way the Italians will let
you fly is if you fly for our country.

521
00:39:59,321 --> 00:40:01,048
I only fly for myself.

522
00:40:01,978 --> 00:40:03,803
You really are a pig, aren't you?

523
00:40:04,051 --> 00:40:06,720
You realize, if they catch a pig,
they won't give him a fair trial.

524
00:40:06,763 --> 00:40:10,713
I understand. Thanks, Ferrari.
Give my regards to the guys.

525
00:40:11,641 --> 00:40:13,146
This movie's really great.

526
00:40:13,531 --> 00:40:17,315
All right. I'll try to look out
for you, but I can only do so much.

527
00:40:17,669 --> 00:40:18,674
Sure.

528
00:40:19,205 --> 00:40:20,756
Well, so long, friend.

529
00:40:39,286 --> 00:40:41,119
Hey, Porco. Need a ride?

530
00:40:44,926 --> 00:40:45,741
Slide over.

531
00:40:53,934 --> 00:40:56,626
I borrowed this truck so we can
take your seaplane to the lake.

532
00:40:57,326 --> 00:40:58,930
We're ready to give it a test flight.

533
00:40:59,439 --> 00:41:02,109
No test flights. I'm getting out of here today.

534
00:41:03,068 --> 00:41:06,634
That's ridiculous. I refuse to
give you the plane without testing it.

535
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:10,617
Plus it'll take at least a day to take
the plane apart and transport it to the lake.

536
00:41:10,747 --> 00:41:11,912
I don't have a choice.

537
00:41:12,311 --> 00:41:15,445
I want you to take a good look
behind us, will you? Do it slowly.

538
00:41:16,198 --> 00:41:18,130
That's the fascists' secret police.

539
00:41:20,043 --> 00:41:21,181
They're following us.

540
00:41:22,754 --> 00:41:24,685
Following us? What for?

541
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:27,228
Because they like my pretty red plane.

542
00:41:27,536 --> 00:41:29,667
Problem is, they don't like me flying it.

543
00:41:33,817 --> 00:41:36,232
Hey, are you a spy or something?

544
00:41:40,981 --> 00:41:41,868
A spy.

545
00:41:44,693 --> 00:41:48,182
That's the last thing I'd ever
do, kid. I only look out for myself.

546
00:41:48,583 --> 00:41:51,195
But you were a hero during the war, right?

547
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:54,232
Well, this is really strange if
you haven't done anything wrong.

548
00:41:54,248 --> 00:41:56,430
I couldn't agree with you more. Hold on.

549
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:02,563
How about we try another direction?

550
00:42:14,914 --> 00:42:17,094
Looks like you've done this kind of thing before.

551
00:42:17,939 --> 00:42:19,722
Every time I go to Milan, kiddo.

552
00:42:49,716 --> 00:42:50,953
The plane's ready when you are.

553
00:42:50,969 --> 00:42:51,326
Hey!

554
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:54,756
Two secret police are hiding
out back, and three in the front.

555
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,208
Ooh, this is so exciting!

556
00:42:57,224 --> 00:42:59,140
Calm down, woman. You're rambling.

557
00:42:59,156 --> 00:42:59,643
What?

558
00:43:02,383 --> 00:43:02,828
Thanks.

559
00:43:02,874 --> 00:43:03,450
Take care.

560
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,085
I will.

561
00:43:15,867 --> 00:43:17,744
Fio! What do you think you're doing?

562
00:43:17,994 --> 00:43:20,992
I'm rigging up my seat. Just
give me about five seconds, okay?

563
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:25,957
You are crazy if you think I'm
letting you fly home with me.

564
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,459
Shh. The secret police will hear you.

565
00:43:29,061 --> 00:43:29,642
<i>Flo...</i>

566
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:34,750
There's a warrant out for my arrest, you realize.

567
00:43:34,803 --> 00:43:37,195
This is not a joy ride, sweetheart. So if you...

568
00:43:37,227 --> 00:43:38,491
Hold this for a second, please.

569
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:41,931
Thank you. Look at this.

570
00:43:42,002 --> 00:43:43,162
Ta-da!

571
00:43:43,426 --> 00:43:45,887
I just whipped this together and it fits perfectly.

572
00:43:46,106 --> 00:43:48,215
It's a bit of a tight fit in here, but it should do.

573
00:43:49,818 --> 00:43:51,082
Would you hold this, please?

574
00:43:52,638 --> 00:43:57,048
Fio, this is way too dangerous. I'll
be taking off from the canal out back.

575
00:43:57,155 --> 00:43:59,026
I don't even know if I can get her off the water.

576
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:00,814
Mmm-hmm.

577
00:44:01,288 --> 00:44:03,903
I know, that's why you need to have the engineer with you.

578
00:44:04,179 --> 00:44:05,984
So I can make adjustments to the plane.

579
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:08,962
Don't you get it? I'm off to fight Curtis.

580
00:44:09,212 --> 00:44:11,894
I will have bullets flying over my head.

581
00:44:12,257 --> 00:44:13,379
I can handle that.

582
00:44:13,973 --> 00:44:17,444
I'm responsible for this plane,
and I want to do my first job right.

583
00:44:17,492 --> 00:44:19,470
Think about it. I'm a known womanizer.

584
00:44:19,794 --> 00:44:22,544
I live on a deserted island in a small tent.

585
00:44:22,846 --> 00:44:24,617
That's great. I love camping.

586
00:44:25,228 --> 00:44:26,555
That's not the point.

587
00:44:28,055 --> 00:44:28,953
Take her.

588
00:44:29,149 --> 00:44:32,482
I'll give you a good deal on her
salary, and I know she'll come in handy.

589
00:44:32,777 --> 00:44:35,643
Besides, I want you back in business so I can get paid.

590
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:37,699
You're this girl's grandfather?

591
00:44:37,782 --> 00:44:39,276
It'll be good for her.

592
00:44:39,655 --> 00:44:42,103
And I'll install this so you two can chitchat.

593
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:45,498
So you're okay with turning her into an outlaw?

594
00:44:45,534 --> 00:44:48,290
Mmm-mmm. I'm going along as your hostage.

595
00:44:48,413 --> 00:44:52,068
See, that way all my relatives can tell
the police they had no choice but to help you.

596
00:44:54,564 --> 00:44:58,541
So please, Porco. Let me come. I can help you.

597
00:45:01,577 --> 00:45:03,666
You better take out one of those machine guns.

598
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,434
What?

599
00:45:04,517 --> 00:45:07,606
There's not enough space in
there, even with your tiny butt.

600
00:45:08,104 --> 00:45:09,514
Now, take out a gun.

601
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,484
Thank you!

602
00:45:10,547 --> 00:45:12,442
And, you know, my butt is bigger than it looks.

603
00:45:12,628 --> 00:45:14,185
I'll have the gun out in two seconds.

604
00:45:15,278 --> 00:45:19,240
If we hang around here much longer,
even the old ladies will want to come.

605
00:45:19,324 --> 00:45:21,743
That'll cost you a lot of moolah.

606
00:45:24,579 --> 00:45:26,103
Grandma, get out of the way!

607
00:45:26,142 --> 00:45:28,382
Hey, Fio, you bring back souvenirs.

608
00:45:28,406 --> 00:45:29,225
I will.

609
00:45:37,514 --> 00:45:38,647
Contact!

610
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,269
Open the door!

611
00:45:57,859 --> 00:45:58,468
Go!

612
00:46:08,187 --> 00:46:08,868
Get down!

613
00:46:21,051 --> 00:46:23,615
Help! He's kidnapped our girl! Fio!

614
00:46:24,118 --> 00:46:25,926
Bring Fio back!

615
00:46:30,233 --> 00:46:31,276
Whoa!

616
00:46:31,312 --> 00:46:33,274
How's the steering, Porco?

617
00:46:33,523 --> 00:46:37,683
It's crazy. It's just like you, Fio.
It's even harder to handle than before.

618
00:46:41,147 --> 00:46:43,371
Stop the plane. I'll make some adjustments.

619
00:46:43,445 --> 00:46:46,319
No, we don't have time. I'll
get her up in the air somehow.

620
00:46:49,649 --> 00:46:51,127
I can't get enough lift.

621
00:46:52,754 --> 00:46:54,106
Porco, there's a ship!

622
00:46:57,612 --> 00:46:58,873
Get up!

623
00:47:02,482 --> 00:47:04,028
Come on, baby!

624
00:47:04,179 --> 00:47:05,930
The aileron's hitting the water!

625
00:47:06,014 --> 00:47:07,026
Use the trim tab!

626
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:07,648
The what?

627
00:47:07,664 --> 00:47:09,482
It's the crank on your right!

628
00:47:10,152 --> 00:47:11,173
Hurry!

629
00:47:24,404 --> 00:47:25,043
Got it!

630
00:47:26,628 --> 00:47:27,443
Here we go.

631
00:48:02,403 --> 00:48:05,670
Gorgeous. This is such an incredible view.

632
00:48:09,811 --> 00:48:11,358
Is that plane following us?

633
00:48:11,509 --> 00:48:13,587
It's someone from the Italian Air Force.

634
00:48:15,014 --> 00:48:17,223
Hey, looks like my old buddy Ferrari is here.

635
00:48:25,578 --> 00:48:26,693
What's he saying?

636
00:48:26,953 --> 00:48:29,355
He says the Air Force has a trap for us up ahead.

637
00:48:29,628 --> 00:48:31,364
He'll show us how we can get out of here.

638
00:48:50,073 --> 00:48:53,260
If we fly low all the way home,
we should stay out of their range.

639
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:55,318
Thank you very much, my friend!

640
00:48:55,915 --> 00:48:57,333
Thank you!

641
00:49:01,531 --> 00:49:03,239
Very funny, you jerk.

642
00:49:03,661 --> 00:49:04,662
What did he say?

643
00:49:05,473 --> 00:49:08,706
He said, "Cute girl. When did you start babysitting?"

644
00:49:53,331 --> 00:49:54,076
Hmm?

645
00:50:13,772 --> 00:50:17,830
"Alas, a solitary rose blooms in a secret garden."

646
00:50:19,003 --> 00:50:21,697
That's my favorite line from a screenplay I wrote.

647
00:50:25,962 --> 00:50:29,036
Mr. Curtis, why are you trespassing in my garden?

648
00:50:29,319 --> 00:50:31,420
I have something special to show you.

649
00:50:38,223 --> 00:50:39,644
It's from Hollywood.

650
00:50:40,348 --> 00:50:43,852
"Dear Mr. Curtis, in regards
to the screenplay you sent us..."

651
00:50:44,278 --> 00:50:47,501
"We'd love to produce it and
will consider you for the lead."

652
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:51,084
The script's title is The Rose of the Adriatic.

653
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,448
That sounds wonderful.

654
00:50:52,532 --> 00:50:54,524
Really? Then it's settled.

655
00:50:55,046 --> 00:50:57,381
Gina, come to Hollywood with me.

656
00:50:59,299 --> 00:51:03,470
I've got great aspirations. I'm
already a big celebrity as a pilot.

657
00:51:04,317 --> 00:51:06,648
Soon I'll be a Hollywood star, and then...

658
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:08,131
There's more?

659
00:51:08,667 --> 00:51:09,866
The President.

660
00:51:10,529 --> 00:51:10,945
Wha...

661
00:51:17,961 --> 00:51:19,044
What's so funny?

662
00:51:19,655 --> 00:51:22,556
I'm serious. Don't you want to be the First Lady?

663
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:24,501
Gina...

664
00:51:25,868 --> 00:51:28,431
I find your humility very charming.

665
00:51:28,672 --> 00:51:29,885
So you'll come with me?

666
00:51:30,859 --> 00:51:34,435
No, I can't. I have a long-standing bet going here.

667
00:51:37,158 --> 00:51:41,375
I bet myself that if a certain man comes
to visit me when I'm out here in my garden,

668
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,645
then the two of us will fall in love.

669
00:51:44,949 --> 00:51:48,189
But that fool only comes to my restaurant at night.

670
00:51:48,542 --> 00:51:50,956
He never stops and shows his face in the daylight.

671
00:52:33,701 --> 00:52:35,780
Porco? I thought he was dead.

672
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:37,012
You fool.

673
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,718
He left without landing. Well, I guess I lose again.

674
00:53:51,014 --> 00:53:53,752
What? You'd choose that stupid pig over me?

675
00:53:54,547 --> 00:53:55,341
That's right.

676
00:53:56,105 --> 00:53:59,909
Love is a little bit more
complicated here than it is in America.

677
00:54:00,251 --> 00:54:02,509
Falling in love happens to you all the time.

678
00:54:03,789 --> 00:54:05,780
So have fun in Hollywood, little boy.

679
00:54:06,848 --> 00:54:07,830
Little boy?

680
00:54:12,623 --> 00:54:15,615
Hey, watch it with the acrobatics.
You made me bump my head.

681
00:54:16,067 --> 00:54:17,721
I was just saying hi to a friend.

682
00:54:18,357 --> 00:54:20,401
Gina of the Hotel Adriano?

683
00:54:21,892 --> 00:54:24,347
She was that lady in the white dress, wasn't she?

684
00:54:24,452 --> 00:54:29,978
My grandfather told me that all the seaplane
pilots of the Adriatic fall madly in love with Gina.

685
00:54:30,436 --> 00:54:31,862
That's wonderful, Fio.

686
00:54:33,349 --> 00:54:35,319
So, is Gina really your friend?

687
00:54:35,379 --> 00:54:36,934
Or are you in love with her, too?

688
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:37,935
It's time to refuel.

689
00:54:37,999 --> 00:54:40,540
Turn around, quit yapping and get your butt in your seat.

690
00:54:40,606 --> 00:54:42,129
What? Hey, wait!

691
00:55:06,873 --> 00:55:09,665
Hey, what's a girl doing on Porco's plane?

692
00:55:10,896 --> 00:55:11,983
Where's Porco?

693
00:55:12,172 --> 00:55:14,850
He's having a serious conversation with my dad.

694
00:55:16,988 --> 00:55:23,105
Both the new government and the old Royalists
have started striking up deals with seaplane pirates.

695
00:55:23,544 --> 00:55:27,170
You're not gonna make a penny
hunting your pirates these days, Porco.

696
00:55:27,214 --> 00:55:28,003
Here you go.

697
00:55:28,294 --> 00:55:29,035
Thanks.

698
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:32,053
Well, sounds like you're out of a job, Porco.

699
00:55:33,171 --> 00:55:35,857
You should join up with one of the two factions.

700
00:55:36,224 --> 00:55:39,283
They'd pay good money for skills like yours.

701
00:55:39,299 --> 00:55:40,309
You betcha.

702
00:55:40,452 --> 00:55:43,732
Especially after Curtis goes back to America.

703
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:44,766
America?

704
00:55:44,782 --> 00:55:47,053
You're the ones who should be going to America.

705
00:55:48,283 --> 00:55:51,891
"Farewell to freedom in the
Adriatic and to days of wild abandon."

706
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:53,989
What is that, Shakespeare?

707
00:55:54,005 --> 00:55:55,694
No, it's Porco. See you later.

708
00:55:55,801 --> 00:55:56,631
So long.

709
00:56:00,222 --> 00:56:02,826
Porco, the price of gas here is ridiculous.

710
00:56:03,035 --> 00:56:05,431
He's charging us three times what we pay in Italy.

711
00:56:07,856 --> 00:56:10,024
Don't be such a crook. Be reasonable.

712
00:56:10,181 --> 00:56:14,256
Here in the Adriatic islands, we
don't dilute our gas like Italians do.

713
00:56:14,512 --> 00:56:16,764
Can you please explain that to her, Porco?

714
00:56:17,348 --> 00:56:18,675
Just pay the kid, Fio.

715
00:56:18,691 --> 00:56:21,820
Then plant your butt that's bigger
than it looks back into its cubbyhole.

716
00:56:21,899 --> 00:56:23,315
We're taking off to my hideout.

717
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:28,486
Fine, the gas money's just gonna go on your bill anyway.

718
00:56:33,342 --> 00:56:34,937
So when do we fight Curtis?

719
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:36,161
No need to now.

720
00:56:36,494 --> 00:56:39,353
I'm out of a job. No one's
hiring bounty hunters these days.

721
00:56:39,894 --> 00:56:41,229
But what about your honor?

722
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:44,698
You can't let Curtis run around
acting like he shot you down.

723
00:56:45,205 --> 00:56:49,021
I'm a pig. I don't fight for
honor. I fight for a paycheck.

724
00:57:05,401 --> 00:57:06,931
Oh, wow.

725
00:57:08,267 --> 00:57:10,002
It's beautiful.

726
00:57:26,524 --> 00:57:28,832
What a fantastic hideout.

727
00:57:29,739 --> 00:57:31,786
It feels good to stretch my legs.

728
00:57:39,097 --> 00:57:40,000
What're you doing? You're on my foot.

729
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:47,198
Hey! Hey!

730
00:57:49,807 --> 00:57:52,403
Well, looks like my hideout's not so hidden anymore.

731
00:57:52,915 --> 00:57:55,334
Boss, we caught the pig!

732
00:57:56,052 --> 00:57:57,970
Get off me. Out of the way!

733
00:57:59,401 --> 00:58:00,360
Move, move it.

734
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:01,985
You're finished, pig.

735
00:58:02,128 --> 00:58:03,863
It's payback time...

736
00:58:03,891 --> 00:58:05,837
We've got a score to settle.

737
00:58:07,248 --> 00:58:09,939
A girl! We got a girl here!

738
00:58:09,955 --> 00:58:10,728
She's cute.

739
00:58:11,268 --> 00:58:12,138
So what?

740
00:58:12,371 --> 00:58:15,381
Half of the world's population is women, idiot.

741
00:58:15,795 --> 00:58:20,519
Hey. Fio's no ordinary girl. She's
a first-class seaplane engineer.

742
00:58:20,607 --> 00:58:21,156
Huh?

743
00:58:21,648 --> 00:58:24,190
But she's so young. And pretty.

744
00:58:24,214 --> 00:58:26,345
Girl engineer. Are you sure?

745
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:29,481
She redesigned my plane, and
now it flies better than ever.

746
00:58:29,845 --> 00:58:31,705
She's young, but she's a genius.

747
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:34,422
You really mean that?

748
00:58:35,015 --> 00:58:37,393
Hey, I never lie about my seaplane, kid.

749
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:39,232
Treat her with respect.

750
00:58:39,446 --> 00:58:41,897
She came along just to make sure I pay my bill.

751
00:58:42,985 --> 00:58:45,947
So you're in debt, too? It serves you right.

752
00:58:46,178 --> 00:58:51,532
Hey, what do you say we smash his stupid, red
plane to bits and leave him here to rot in debt?

753
00:58:52,871 --> 00:58:55,902
Smash it? You'd destroy a work of art?

754
00:58:56,374 --> 00:58:59,564
It happens to be a one-of-a-kind Savoia S.21.

755
00:58:59,831 --> 00:59:03,340
We realize it's a nice plane, but we have our reasons.

756
00:59:03,382 --> 00:59:04,591
Yeah? What are they?

757
00:59:04,607 --> 00:59:06,259
Well, it's kind of complicated.

758
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:08,541
You call yourselves seaplane pilots?

759
00:59:09,136 --> 00:59:10,946
Step aside! Watch the shoes.

760
00:59:19,527 --> 00:59:24,004
My grandpa has been telling me stories
about seaplane pilots ever since I was born.

761
00:59:24,847 --> 00:59:29,573
He always says that seaplane pilots are the most
honorable and trustworthy fighters in the world.

762
00:59:30,193 --> 00:59:34,354
Every time they fly, both the
ocean and the sky purify their hearts.

763
00:59:35,064 --> 00:59:37,767
So they're braver than any pilot in the sky,

764
00:59:38,362 --> 00:59:41,045
and they are mightier than any sailor in the sea.

765
00:59:41,246 --> 00:59:43,081
Yeah.

766
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:44,631
Miss Fio, thank you.

767
00:59:44,787 --> 00:59:47,091
You make me proud to be a seaplane pilot.

768
00:59:47,148 --> 00:59:48,301
And you should be.

769
00:59:48,317 --> 00:59:50,904
I can tell you're not about money or revenge.

770
00:59:51,373 --> 00:59:52,501
You're about honor.

771
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,395
That's right, Fio!

772
00:59:55,574 --> 00:59:57,498
Yeah! To honor!

773
00:59:58,921 --> 01:00:00,897
Now, that girl is something else.

774
01:00:01,792 --> 01:00:02,896
Okay, Miss Fio.

775
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:06,361
We respect you, so we will not
destroy the plane that you made.

776
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:10,676
But we still hate that stinking
pig's guts, and we want payback!

777
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:12,777
Slice him into bacon!

778
01:00:16,428 --> 01:00:18,728
What are you morons talking about?

779
01:00:19,014 --> 01:00:21,591
You can't gang up on a fellow seaplane pilot!

780
01:00:21,607 --> 01:00:22,763
Where's your honor?

781
01:00:22,998 --> 01:00:25,626
You all should be completely ashamed of yourselves.

782
01:00:25,797 --> 01:00:30,062
A real seaplane pilot would never
fight in a pack like a bunch of cowards.

783
01:00:30,155 --> 01:00:31,048
Look at Porco.

784
01:00:31,093 --> 01:00:34,305
He came back here just so he
could have a rematch with Curtis.

785
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:38,282
And defend his reputation,
like a real seaplane pilot should.

786
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:42,391
So if you want to fight Porco
honorably, then you fight him in the sky.

787
01:00:42,891 --> 01:00:43,856
One-on-one.

788
01:00:43,971 --> 01:00:47,235
I'd fight Porco, but my plane has engine trouble.

789
01:00:47,411 --> 01:00:50,366
You big liar. Quit making excuses.

790
01:00:50,489 --> 01:00:51,852
What should we do, boss?

791
01:00:51,932 --> 01:00:53,815
She did make some good points.

792
01:00:53,863 --> 01:00:56,302
We have to pick someone who can fight Porco.

793
01:00:56,619 --> 01:00:58,304
I think we should talk to Curtis.

794
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:01,203
Wait a minute, ask him to fight the pig again?

795
01:01:01,712 --> 01:01:03,418
Only Curtis can beat him.

796
01:01:04,258 --> 01:01:06,296
Our contract with him has already expired.

797
01:01:08,834 --> 01:01:10,132
Howdy, fellas.

798
01:01:10,449 --> 01:01:11,684
Look, it's Curtis!

799
01:01:12,636 --> 01:01:13,963
What's he doing here?

800
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:16,330
I followed y'all.

801
01:01:16,618 --> 01:01:18,823
I knew you'd get into trouble without me.

802
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:21,961
Nice going, Fio.

803
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:24,288
Look at the mess you've gotten me into now.

804
01:01:35,153 --> 01:01:36,644
Here, hold these.

805
01:01:41,307 --> 01:01:44,126
So you wanna challenge me to a rematch, do you, pig?

806
01:01:45,247 --> 01:01:46,670
Why should I give it to you?

807
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:50,149
I won once already, and my
contract with these boys has expired.

808
01:01:50,479 --> 01:01:52,981
Well, give us a proposition. What do you want?

809
01:01:53,734 --> 01:01:54,532
Hmm.

810
01:02:03,478 --> 01:02:04,706
Beautiful.

811
01:02:06,311 --> 01:02:08,760
Tell you what. If I win, will you marry me, darling?

812
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:13,526
That's what I want.

813
01:02:13,684 --> 01:02:14,641
Fine with me.

814
01:02:14,705 --> 01:02:18,349
But if Porco beats you, then you
have to pay off the debt he owes me.

815
01:02:18,848 --> 01:02:20,010
Don't do it, Fio.

816
01:02:20,986 --> 01:02:21,830
Back off!

817
01:02:26,417 --> 01:02:29,128
Miss Fio, are you quite certain you want to do this?

818
01:02:29,144 --> 01:02:30,528
You should ask him, not me.

819
01:02:31,023 --> 01:02:32,965
These bills are kind of expensive.

820
01:02:33,048 --> 01:02:33,769
No, they're not.

821
01:02:34,202 --> 01:02:35,842
Are you gonna fight or not?

822
01:02:36,443 --> 01:02:39,472
I will gladly fight for the woman that I love.

823
01:02:39,548 --> 01:02:40,736
Good.

824
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,866
All right!

825
01:02:42,973 --> 01:02:45,804
The fight will take place first thing tomorrow morning.

826
01:02:45,891 --> 01:02:49,481
And since Fio is doing such an
honorable thing, my gang will host.

827
01:02:49,623 --> 01:02:50,833
Yeah!

828
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,533
Hey, we'd like to host, too.

829
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,793
So long, Miss Fio!

830
01:03:02,913 --> 01:03:04,270
This is ridiculous.

831
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:05,486
So long!

832
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:06,810
Bye-bye!

833
01:03:07,054 --> 01:03:11,090
Shut up! Just go home already!

834
01:03:11,311 --> 01:03:12,179
Okay.

835
01:03:16,521 --> 01:03:21,166
What on earth possessed you to make that deal?

836
01:03:21,267 --> 01:03:22,377
Well, I'm sorry.

837
01:03:23,697 --> 01:03:25,512
I guess I shouldn't have intervened.

838
01:03:26,558 --> 01:03:28,426
I'm just a stupid little girl.

839
01:03:31,937 --> 01:03:36,457
Fio, I should thank you for saving my life back there.

840
01:03:37,085 --> 01:03:39,148
You really put yourself on the line.

841
01:03:39,862 --> 01:03:40,830
So thanks.

842
01:03:41,209 --> 01:03:43,474
It looks like we're in this thing together now.

843
01:03:44,003 --> 01:03:45,611
So you'll fight Curtis?

844
01:03:48,113 --> 01:03:49,322
He could win, you know.

845
01:03:50,887 --> 01:03:52,426
You've got more honor.

846
01:03:54,279 --> 01:03:54,946
"Honor."

847
01:03:55,575 --> 01:03:59,379
Well, I hate that word, but somehow,
when you say it, it doesn't sound so bad.

848
01:04:05,283 --> 01:04:07,772
What's the matter with you? Are you cold?

849
01:04:08,654 --> 01:04:09,162
Fio.

850
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:10,913
Oh, boy.

851
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:14,812
I'm shaking all over, my heart's pounding like crazy.

852
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:17,385
I guess I was really scared.

853
01:04:17,913 --> 01:04:20,808
I just didn't know if you would fight for me, Porco.

854
01:04:24,336 --> 01:04:25,583
Whoa. What are you doing?

855
01:04:26,244 --> 01:04:27,180
I need a swim.

856
01:04:46,432 --> 01:04:47,696
Oh, no!

857
01:04:48,374 --> 01:04:49,761
What? What's wrong?

858
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:52,772
I really blew it, Porco!

859
01:04:52,981 --> 01:04:54,759
I should've padded those bills.

860
01:04:55,059 --> 01:04:57,206
Curtis would have paid us a lot more.

861
01:05:00,171 --> 01:05:01,137
You're right.

862
01:05:55,636 --> 01:05:56,334
Marco?

863
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:57,500
Hmm?

864
01:05:58,595 --> 01:05:59,561
Can't you sleep?

865
01:06:00,951 --> 01:06:01,791
I saw...

866
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:05,357
Maybe it was a dream.

867
01:06:06,863 --> 01:06:09,653
Go back to sleep. We've got a big day tomorrow.

868
01:06:11,281 --> 01:06:11,858
Porco?

869
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:13,106
Yeah?

870
01:06:13,618 --> 01:06:15,218
Why did you turn into a pig?

871
01:06:15,954 --> 01:06:17,553
All middle-aged men are pigs.

872
01:06:18,659 --> 01:06:21,984
You know, I've heard a lot about Captain Marco Rossellini.

873
01:06:22,193 --> 01:06:24,351
My father was in his fighter unit.

874
01:06:25,385 --> 01:06:30,421
He told me that Marco once landed his seaplane
in a raging sea to save the life of an enemy pilot.

875
01:06:30,761 --> 01:06:32,209
I think that's amazing.

876
01:06:36,499 --> 01:06:39,024
I got it! What if I kiss you, Porco?

877
01:06:39,348 --> 01:06:39,797
Huh?

878
01:06:40,471 --> 01:06:45,692
Yeah, you've heard of the fairy tale where the girl kisses
the frog and it turns him back into a handsome prince.

879
01:06:45,984 --> 01:06:46,886
Come on.

880
01:06:46,902 --> 01:06:49,693
You've gotta save it for somebody
special, for crying out loud.

881
01:06:51,452 --> 01:06:52,678
Don't you like me?

882
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:57,339
You're a great kid.

883
01:06:57,948 --> 01:06:59,141
You know what, Fio?

884
01:06:59,481 --> 01:07:02,754
Seeing you makes me wish I'd never given up being human.

885
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:03,715
Now go to sleep.

886
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:07,845
First tell me a story. Then I'll go to sleep.

887
01:07:09,574 --> 01:07:10,331
All right.

888
01:07:12,985 --> 01:07:13,961
Here's a winner.

889
01:07:23,095 --> 01:07:25,499
It was the last summer of the Great War.

890
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:32,775
We were flying over the Adriatic on a routine
surveillance patrol, headed toward Istria.

891
01:07:38,791 --> 01:07:40,971
My good buddy Berlini was right beside me.

892
01:07:42,429 --> 01:07:45,618
He had just gotten married to Gina of the Hotel Adriano,

893
01:07:48,193 --> 01:07:49,453
and I was his best man.

894
01:07:51,656 --> 01:07:55,634
But the war called, <i>so we had to go
back into battle right after the ceremony.</i>

895
01:08:04,498 --> 01:08:07,871
Suddenly, we were in the middle
of the worst dogfight of my life.

896
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:18,944
Friends and enemies were falling all around me like flies.

897
01:08:19,568 --> 01:08:22,128
I had three planes trying to chase me down,

898
01:08:22,467 --> 01:08:24,487
and all I thought about was myself.

899
01:08:25,142 --> 01:08:28,061
Soon I realized I was the only one left from my unit.

900
01:08:29,037 --> 01:08:30,609
But the enemy never let up.

901
01:08:31,241 --> 01:08:33,522
I flew my guts out trying to get away.

902
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,547
My hands and feet went numb.

903
01:08:36,094 --> 01:08:38,272
I could feel myself starting to black out.

904
01:08:38,907 --> 01:08:40,274
I was sure I was going to die.

905
01:08:40,313 --> 01:08:43,346
Then suddenly, everything around me turned white.

906
01:08:43,878 --> 01:08:44,603
White?

907
01:08:44,677 --> 01:08:47,754
Yeah. It was the strangest thing I'd ever seen.

908
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:51,714
The light was so pure, I figured I must be in heaven.

909
01:08:52,146 --> 01:08:54,753
Then I realized I had just flown into a cloud.

910
01:08:55,771 --> 01:08:57,105
! was so exhausted,

911
01:08:57,157 --> 01:08:59,519
I couldn't hold onto the stick to fly my plane.

912
01:09:00,076 --> 01:09:01,839
But the plane just kept on flying.

913
01:09:29,075 --> 01:09:30,456
It flew by itself?

914
01:09:31,277 --> 01:09:31,933
Yeah.

915
01:09:32,797 --> 01:09:36,307
It was perfectly quiet, and the sky was beautiful.

916
01:09:37,441 --> 01:09:40,835
Then I saw this strange band of white high above me.

917
01:10:09,946 --> 01:10:12,231
Berlini! I thought you were dead!

918
01:10:15,773 --> 01:10:18,194
Come back here! Where do you think you're going?

919
01:10:31,235 --> 01:10:34,847
What about Gina? You can't
leave her alone. Let me go instead.

920
01:10:35,515 --> 01:10:36,307
Hold on!

921
01:11:17,137 --> 01:11:20,367
When I came to, I was skimming just above the sea,

922
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:22,192
all alone.

923
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,828
God was telling you it wasn't your time yet.

924
01:11:29,164 --> 01:11:29,981
You think?

925
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:34,818
Seems to me he was telling me I was a
pig and maybe I deserved to be all alone.

926
01:11:35,129 --> 01:11:37,560
You can't believe that. You're a good person.

927
01:11:37,974 --> 01:11:40,284
No, the good guys were the ones who died.

928
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:45,700
Or maybe I'm dead and life as
a pig is the same thing as hell.

929
01:11:46,347 --> 01:11:47,299
Now go to sleep.

930
01:11:49,219 --> 01:11:52,597
That stupid kid, he sold me rusted cartridges.

931
01:11:54,485 --> 01:11:56,955
I think you're a great human being, Porco.

932
01:11:57,513 --> 01:11:59,322
And I'm glad you're still around.

933
01:12:01,178 --> 01:12:01,849
Good night!

934
01:12:26,190 --> 01:12:28,050
Hurry and place your bets. Don't miss out on the action.

935
01:12:28,066 --> 01:12:30,145
The odds are eight to seven, Curtis
over Porco, that's eight to seven.

936
01:12:30,161 --> 01:12:33,415
I've got two box seats left, two
seats. And three in the bleachers.

937
01:12:33,431 --> 01:12:35,767
Come on, get your ice cream.

938
01:12:38,316 --> 01:12:39,248
A hundred on the plane.

939
01:12:39,831 --> 01:12:41,270
That's what we pledge?

940
01:12:41,818 --> 01:12:43,701
Too many people here.

941
01:12:43,885 --> 01:12:46,912
Bunch of morons. They're turning this into a big party.

942
01:12:46,928 --> 01:12:49,139
Are all these people here air pirates?

943
01:12:49,166 --> 01:12:51,795
No, you've got trash from all over the Mediterranean.

944
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:53,768
Gangsters, smugglers, gamblers.

945
01:12:53,971 --> 01:12:57,545
Yeah, you might have a handful of
respectable people, but I doubt it.

946
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:01,651
Wow. Not only do I get a wife,
I'll be getting even more famous.

947
01:13:02,215 --> 01:13:05,715
Ten minutes to start. Ten minutes to start.

948
01:13:06,366 --> 01:13:07,198
Listen up!

949
01:13:07,361 --> 01:13:11,242
This is a fight of honor between
Porco Rosso and Donald Curtis,

950
01:13:11,726 --> 01:13:17,864
so if one of you fights dirty, you'll be
disrespected by seaplane pilots for eternity.

951
01:13:20,071 --> 01:13:23,699
Off the stage, loud mouth. We
didn't come to hear a speech!

952
01:13:23,742 --> 01:13:24,797
Pipe down!

953
01:13:25,416 --> 01:13:26,582
Quiet down!

954
01:13:26,634 --> 01:13:29,292
The next person I hear whining is dead meat.

955
01:13:38,068 --> 01:13:40,736
Why not drop a bomb and really get some quiet?

956
01:13:41,388 --> 01:13:45,779
This fight will decide the fate of
Miss Fio, who we all love and respect.

957
01:13:46,196 --> 01:13:49,275
So keep your mouths shut! You got that?

958
01:13:49,491 --> 01:13:52,702
If you do, clap your hands. Clap now!

959
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:55,955
Let's get started already.

960
01:13:56,102 --> 01:13:59,787
Shut up, pig. We're following official procedures.

961
01:14:00,445 --> 01:14:03,379
Now, both of you place your bets on these chairs.

962
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:09,812
Thank you.

963
01:14:10,876 --> 01:14:12,241
Set it down, moron!

964
01:14:15,354 --> 01:14:17,336
If both sides are satisfied,

965
01:14:17,574 --> 01:14:19,804
you should shake hands or something like that.

966
01:14:20,421 --> 01:14:22,965
Forget it. I like to keep my hands clean.

967
01:14:25,896 --> 01:14:27,930
Fine, let's just get on with it.

968
01:14:28,499 --> 01:14:30,699
We'll go to the church as soon as this is over.

969
01:14:31,775 --> 01:14:33,099
Ah, don't worry, Fio.

970
01:14:33,229 --> 01:14:36,141
According to my sweet mama, it isn't the love that counts.

971
01:14:41,209 --> 01:14:42,049
Hey. Hey!

972
01:14:42,065 --> 01:14:43,613
Miss Fio, can we take a picture with you?

973
01:14:43,629 --> 01:14:44,875
We even took a bath.

974
01:14:44,963 --> 01:14:46,804
Okay. Everybody ready?

975
01:14:46,994 --> 01:14:47,331
Ready.

976
01:14:47,347 --> 01:14:48,466
Cheese!

977
01:14:48,482 --> 01:14:49,172
Smile!

978
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:13,196
Over-under, three minutes, with Curtis the favorite.

979
01:15:13,816 --> 01:15:14,897
This is great.

980
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:16,945
We should get them to do this every month.

981
01:15:20,234 --> 01:15:22,361
<i>Fifteen seconds to start.</i>

982
01:15:26,624 --> 01:15:28,322
Wow. I've got chills.

983
01:15:29,312 --> 01:15:30,196
Five seconds.

984
01:15:30,642 --> 01:15:35,313
Four, three, two, one, go!

985
01:15:35,358 --> 01:15:36,442
Go, go!

986
01:15:44,022 --> 01:15:45,386
Curtis is up first.

987
01:16:02,937 --> 01:16:05,571
It looks like this is going to be a one-sided fight.

988
01:16:05,587 --> 01:16:06,399
Give me those.

989
01:16:13,173 --> 01:16:15,640
Porco, what are you doing? Get some altitude!

990
01:16:15,787 --> 01:16:18,157
He'll be eating bullets if he climbs up now.

991
01:16:18,396 --> 01:16:19,526
He's being tricky.

992
01:16:19,721 --> 01:16:22,852
It's harder for Curtis to hit
him if he's close to the water.

993
01:16:27,322 --> 01:16:29,870
Aha! You're trying to make me
waste my bullets, aren't you??

994
01:16:46,063 --> 01:16:48,531
Look at that. Porco gave him the Loop.

995
01:16:48,807 --> 01:16:49,793
What's the Loop?

996
01:16:50,494 --> 01:16:53,352
The Loop is what made Porco the ace of the Adriatic.

997
01:16:58,182 --> 01:16:59,301
He's got me.

998
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:06,250
He's gonna shoot!

999
01:17:11,184 --> 01:17:12,143
Look, he's not shooting.

1000
01:17:12,192 --> 01:17:14,138
What's wrong? Is his machine gun jammed?

1001
01:17:14,337 --> 01:17:16,355
I think I know what's going on here.

1002
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:18,039
Porco won't shoot a pilot.

1003
01:17:19,127 --> 01:17:20,613
He'll only shoot the plane.

1004
01:17:21,035 --> 01:17:23,538
Look. There, he's in perfect position.

1005
01:17:23,785 --> 01:17:25,156
Come on! Shoot!

1006
01:17:25,957 --> 01:17:28,596
Nope, he's not going for it, just as I thought.

1007
01:17:29,154 --> 01:17:31,654
If the pig shoots now, he'll kill Curtis.

1008
01:17:32,094 --> 01:17:36,069
I bet he plans to tire Curtis out,
and then shoot his engine up instead.

1009
01:17:36,752 --> 01:17:38,187
What a show-off.

1010
01:17:40,511 --> 01:17:41,171
Porco.

1011
01:17:42,296 --> 01:17:45,633
Are you messing with me? Come on, shoot!

1012
01:17:46,218 --> 01:17:49,051
Ha! I bet your gun is jammed, isn't it?

1013
01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:50,537
Serves you right, pig!

1014
01:17:55,945 --> 01:17:57,821
They're coming towards us!

1015
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:03,232
So you want to play games with me, is that it?

1016
01:18:08,207 --> 01:18:10,402
Don't kill us, kill each other!

1017
01:18:10,551 --> 01:18:12,553
Curtis pulled away from the pig!

1018
01:18:13,339 --> 01:18:15,373
Jump! Jump!

1019
01:18:25,244 --> 01:18:26,860
Hey, watch the money!

1020
01:18:31,711 --> 01:18:34,732
Amazing! The pig's leaving vapor trails.

1021
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:42,292
Unbelievable.

1022
01:18:42,371 --> 01:18:44,714
I have never seen a dogfight like this in my life.

1023
01:18:44,819 --> 01:18:46,422
They sure are crazy.

1024
01:18:55,838 --> 01:18:58,674
Hey, the fight's going to be
over. What's taking her so long?

1025
01:18:58,924 --> 01:19:01,648
I don't know. She's in her room with the door shut.

1026
01:19:01,696 --> 01:19:03,864
Boy, I really don't want to miss this fight.

1027
01:19:04,717 --> 01:19:06,088
Is she coming or not?

1028
01:19:17,276 --> 01:19:19,982
Gina, Italians know about fight.

1029
01:19:20,133 --> 01:19:21,777
Get the pig out of there.

1030
01:19:21,965 --> 01:19:22,651
Ferrari.

1031
01:19:23,781 --> 01:19:25,342
Oh, Marco.

1032
01:19:29,335 --> 01:19:30,950
I hope I'm not too late.

1033
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:51,284
I can't believe they can keep this up.

1034
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:54,014
Looks like the pig's fading.

1035
01:19:56,312 --> 01:19:58,821
Go on, Porco, hang in there!

1036
01:20:03,219 --> 01:20:04,549
Must win.

1037
01:20:10,192 --> 01:20:13,122
I'm not handing Fio over to a jerk like you.

1038
01:20:18,405 --> 01:20:20,465
He's got Curtis's engine in sight.

1039
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:22,216
It's over!

1040
01:20:28,267 --> 01:20:30,770
No, no! Don't jam now!

1041
01:20:34,687 --> 01:20:35,682
Gotcha.

1042
01:20:37,023 --> 01:20:38,149
Huh?

1043
01:20:39,161 --> 01:20:39,619
What?

1044
01:20:41,172 --> 01:20:42,463
It can't be jammed.

1045
01:20:43,738 --> 01:20:46,545
It's not jammed. You used up all your ammo, you idiot!

1046
01:20:47,293 --> 01:20:48,167
That's not good.

1047
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:50,827
And no second gun, thanks to Fio's big butt.

1048
01:20:53,222 --> 01:20:56,476
I refuse to end this fight with a draw.

1049
01:20:57,872 --> 01:21:01,194
You stupid cowboy. There's no
way you can hit me with that.

1050
01:21:03,739 --> 01:21:04,746
Oh, yeah?

1051
01:21:07,022 --> 01:21:11,514
You think you can hit me from
there? Come on. Give me a break.

1052
01:21:19,095 --> 01:21:20,636
You think that's funny?

1053
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:26,150
You're not even coming close. Throw something already.

1054
01:21:26,223 --> 01:21:27,641
You throw like a girl.

1055
01:21:27,657 --> 01:21:29,565
You don't even know anything about girls.

1056
01:21:29,610 --> 01:21:30,900
Shut up, pig!

1057
01:21:32,395 --> 01:21:33,813
What's going on up there?

1058
01:21:33,923 --> 01:21:35,438
Come on, Porco!

1059
01:21:44,096 --> 01:21:45,167
They're coming in!

1060
01:21:45,574 --> 01:21:48,652
Wait, you're a bet. The bets can't run off, Fio.

1061
01:21:48,946 --> 01:21:50,207
I go where the money goes.

1062
01:21:50,369 --> 01:21:51,608
<i>Wail for me!</i>

1063
01:21:57,794 --> 01:21:59,407
Why, you crazy pig!

1064
01:22:01,454 --> 01:22:03,023
Come and get it, cowboy!

1065
01:22:09,146 --> 01:22:10,445
Come on, put 'em up.

1066
01:22:11,212 --> 01:22:12,708
Fine with me, you weakling.

1067
01:22:18,791 --> 01:22:19,562
No!

1068
01:22:20,156 --> 01:22:21,247
Porco!

1069
01:22:23,723 --> 01:22:24,836
Get up, pig.

1070
01:22:29,977 --> 01:22:30,794
You're cheating!

1071
01:22:30,841 --> 01:22:31,747
Shut up!

1072
01:22:39,268 --> 01:22:39,953
Hick!

1073
01:22:55,313 --> 01:22:58,219
Come on, Porco. Block! Upper cut!

1074
01:22:58,998 --> 01:23:00,648
Hit him! Hit him!

1075
01:23:01,104 --> 01:23:02,923
Now we've got a boxing match.

1076
01:23:02,947 --> 01:23:04,385
The bets are still open!

1077
01:23:04,441 --> 01:23:06,847
Taking bets! Taking bets here!

1078
01:23:09,673 --> 01:23:11,876
Can't you fly this plane any faster?

1079
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:14,532
Sorry, ma'am, but I'm afraid the engine will overheat.

1080
01:23:14,737 --> 01:23:16,777
Seaplane pilots are all idiots.

1081
01:23:19,875 --> 01:23:21,591
End of round five!

1082
01:23:23,514 --> 01:23:26,827
Hey, Fio. Did you see that left hook I threw?

1083
01:23:30,758 --> 01:23:33,934
I'm gonna finish you off in the next round.

1084
01:23:35,094 --> 01:23:37,199
This time, I'm sending you to dreamland, Curtis.

1085
01:23:37,215 --> 01:23:38,812
Get him, hit him, hit him!

1086
01:23:39,001 --> 01:23:41,560
I'll make prosciutto out of you!

1087
01:23:43,058 --> 01:23:45,310
Come on, you big womanizer.

1088
01:23:45,968 --> 01:23:47,749
You're the one that's a womanizer.

1089
01:23:49,711 --> 01:23:51,523
You fall in love with every woman you meet.

1090
01:23:51,539 --> 01:23:53,533
You're the one hogging all the girls.

1091
01:23:53,715 --> 01:23:56,115
Why don't you pick one? Gina or Fio?

1092
01:23:56,461 --> 01:23:58,156
What are you talking about?

1093
01:24:00,958 --> 01:24:02,764
You can't have both.

1094
01:24:05,163 --> 01:24:06,533
Gina says...

1095
01:24:07,282 --> 01:24:10,582
Don't you say "Gina," like you know her.

1096
01:24:11,448 --> 01:24:16,603
Gina says that she's been waiting for you.

1097
01:24:19,562 --> 01:24:25,874
For years now. She's been wanting to
meet you in that stupid garden of hers.

1098
01:24:29,367 --> 01:24:31,857
She loves you, pig.

1099
01:24:32,425 --> 01:24:33,198
Huh?

1100
01:24:39,577 --> 01:24:40,500
Porco!

1101
01:24:40,516 --> 01:24:41,721
The bell sounded before he went down.

1102
01:24:41,737 --> 01:24:45,317
Come on. That's a knockout, start counting!

1103
01:24:45,333 --> 01:24:48,031
Nope, the round is over. Back to your corner.

1104
01:24:50,987 --> 01:24:53,724
There they are. The Air Force hasn't arrived yet.

1105
01:24:56,657 --> 01:24:59,046
End of round six.

1106
01:25:03,819 --> 01:25:04,918
Round seven.

1107
01:25:05,062 --> 01:25:08,262
Gina does not want me, you liar.

1108
01:25:11,717 --> 01:25:14,968
I'm not lying. Why would I make that up?

1109
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:17,351
So you want Gina?

1110
01:25:19,451 --> 01:25:21,301
You can't have Fio.

1111
01:25:23,161 --> 01:25:24,821
That's Gina's plane.

1112
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:29,116
Hey, it's an emergency signal.

1113
01:25:40,706 --> 01:25:42,907
One. Two.

1114
01:25:43,437 --> 01:25:45,247
Whoever gets up first wins.

1115
01:25:45,324 --> 01:25:45,731
Four.

1116
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:47,945
Excuse me, let me through, please.

1117
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:49,653
Six.

1118
01:25:49,945 --> 01:25:50,757
Seven!

1119
01:25:51,173 --> 01:25:52,237
<i>Gina! Wait!</i>

1120
01:25:53,573 --> 01:25:54,531
Eight.

1121
01:25:56,764 --> 01:25:58,803
Marco. Marco, get up.

1122
01:26:01,711 --> 01:26:04,856
I don't wanna see you breaking
any more hearts, you hear me?

1123
01:26:10,079 --> 01:26:10,917
Nine!

1124
01:26:14,235 --> 01:26:14,641
Yay!

1125
01:26:14,657 --> 01:26:15,211
Porco!

1126
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:19,676
The winner!

1127
01:26:19,692 --> 01:26:21,137
Porco, thank you!

1128
01:26:21,186 --> 01:26:23,669
Yeah. Piece of cake.

1129
01:26:30,617 --> 01:26:32,228
Now listen up, everybody.

1130
01:26:32,319 --> 01:26:34,880
The Italian Air Force is on its way here.

1131
01:26:35,205 --> 01:26:39,134
So anybody in trouble with the
Italian authorities better move on out.

1132
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:42,071
Come to my place. Drinks are on the house.

1133
01:26:43,342 --> 01:26:45,651
Okay, gang, let's scram.

1134
01:26:54,934 --> 01:26:57,720
Mr. Curtis, the fight's over.

1135
01:26:59,646 --> 01:27:02,169
Hey, boss! Come on, hurry up!

1136
01:27:03,201 --> 01:27:05,585
I'm trying to be classy, you idiot.

1137
01:27:07,644 --> 01:27:09,533
You're a great seaplane engineer.

1138
01:27:10,465 --> 01:27:12,471
Keep it up, Miss Fio. Bye.

1139
01:27:13,306 --> 01:27:14,218
Thank you.

1140
01:27:14,645 --> 01:27:16,077
And keep up the bathing.

1141
01:27:17,087 --> 01:27:19,698
And I wanna say thanks to you, too, Mr. Curtis.

1142
01:27:19,993 --> 01:27:23,246
Next time, I'll propose to you formally and skip the bet.

1143
01:27:23,805 --> 01:27:24,323
Okay.

1144
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,297
But I already know my answer.

1145
01:27:27,623 --> 01:27:29,601
Fio, you're going with Gina.

1146
01:27:29,668 --> 01:27:31,547
No! No!

1147
01:27:32,348 --> 01:27:35,860
I'm going with you. You said we were in this together.

1148
01:27:36,516 --> 01:27:40,038
Gina, take her to a respectable society, please.

1149
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:44,864
You always do this, Marco. It's just not fair.

1150
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:49,727
Sorry. Off you go.

1151
01:27:55,414 --> 01:27:56,202
Let's go.

1152
01:28:28,469 --> 01:28:30,461
Here come the Italian Air Force.

1153
01:28:30,745 --> 01:28:32,399
I'm going to draw them away from the others.

1154
01:28:32,481 --> 01:28:33,114
You wanna help?

1155
01:28:33,645 --> 01:28:34,098
Sure...

1156
01:28:35,248 --> 01:28:38,339
Hey! Your face! Wait! Wait up!

1157
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:39,294
Turn around!

1158
01:28:39,309 --> 01:28:40,319
Get away from me.

1159
01:28:40,397 --> 01:28:42,011
Come on, let me see.

1160
01:28:51,219 --> 01:28:55,493
Porco flew rings around the Italian Air
Force, and they never caught up with him again.

1161
01:28:57,968 --> 01:29:01,057
I stayed with Gina for a while,
and we became good friends.

1162
01:29:02,243 --> 01:29:05,161
But soon, I decided it was time to go back to Milan.

1163
01:29:08,452 --> 01:29:11,623
Through the years, there have been a
few wars and a good deal of turmoil,

1164
01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:14,376
but my friendship with Gina has remained strong.

1165
01:29:17,050 --> 01:29:20,029
I am now president of the Piccolo Company,

1166
01:29:20,170 --> 01:29:22,733
and we're busy designing all sorts of radical new planes,

1167
01:29:22,749 --> 01:29:26,856
but I take time out every
summer to visit the Hotel Adriano.

1168
01:29:27,879 --> 01:29:30,541
The old pirate gangs still hang out at Gina's bar.

1169
01:29:32,390 --> 01:29:37,684
Mr. Curtis still writes to me sometimes, although
he has yet to become President of the United States.

1170
01:29:39,495 --> 01:29:42,920
He says he still fondly remembers
that summer in the Adriatic.

1171
01:29:45,663 --> 01:29:47,892
And as for how Gina's bet turned out,

1172
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:51,017
well, that's our secret.
