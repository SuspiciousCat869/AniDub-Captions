[Cal]
So, what can I get for you?

00:21:45.472 --> 00:21:46.874 position:33% line:89% align:start
Information.

00:21:46.908 --> 00:21:49.577 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, gee, these old ears

What do you want to know?

00:21:59.787 --> 00:22:01.055 position:24% line:83% align:start
Looking for someone
named Chenxiang.

Huh? Chenxiang?

I've never heard of him.

Now what was that for?

00:22:47.001 --> 00:22:48.435 position:24% line:89% align:start
So it's true then.

00:22:49.837 --> 00:22:53.074 position:16% line:89% align:start
[giggles] Oh, Mu Erlang.

00:23:00.114 --> 00:23:02.683 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wait a second, where's
your three-headed sword?

00:23:02.717 --> 00:23:05.853 position:19% line:83% align:start
And your silver-bullet
slingshot, huh?

00:23:05.887 --> 00:23:07.688 position:27% line:89% align:start

Ladies and gentlemen, gaze
upon the great and once mighty

00:23:12.994 --> 00:23:14.829 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yang Jian.

00:23:15.062 --> 00:23:16.831 position:16% line:83% align:start
[woman] Is it really him?
It can't be.

00:23:16.864 --> 00:23:17.732 position:44% line:83% align:start
[man]
What happened to him?

00:23:17.765 --> 00:23:19.432 position:30% line:89% align:start
Good question.

00:23:19.466 --> 00:23:21.202 position:19% line:89% align:start
What did happen to you?

00:23:21.235 --> 00:23:24.038 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hey, don't worry,
why don't I tell them?

00:23:25.472 --> 00:23:26.941 position:33% line:83% align:start
[hollow thud]
[clearing throat]

00:23:26.974 --> 00:23:30.111 position:13% line:89% align:start
Years ago, 12 to be exact,

00:23:30.144 --> 00:23:33.014 position:16% line:83% align:start
a goddess by the name of
Yang Chan had the gall

00:23:33.047 --> 00:23:34.916 position:30% line:83% align:start
to fall in love
with a mortal human,

00:23:34.949 --> 00:23:36.784 position:19% line:89% align:start
breaking Heaven's laws.

00:23:36.817 --> 00:23:40.054 position:21% line:83% align:start
So Yang Jian trapped
her under Mount Hua.

00:23:41.488 --> 00:23:43.758 position:7% line:89% align:start
And she's his sister by blood.

00:23:43.791 --> 00:23:46.127 position:21% line:89% align:start
[patrons whispering]

00:23:46.594 --> 00:23:49.196 position:19% line:83% align:start
But Yang Chan would not
be trapped so easily.

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:53.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
She fought back hard, using
Mount Hua's legendary Lotus Lamp

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:56.637 position:19% line:83% align:start
to blind his Third Eye,
impairing his abilities.

00:23:56.671 --> 00:24:00.074 position:10% line:83% align:start
Since then, the powerful Yang
Jian hasn't been able to use

00:24:00.107 --> 00:24:02.009 position:35% line:89% align:start
his powers.

00:24:02.043 --> 00:24:03.077 position:19% line:89% align:start
[man] Serves him right!

00:24:04.011 --> 00:24:05.846 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, why?

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:10.584 position:10% line:83% align:start
So I ask, what kind of person
would be such a rule follower

00:24:10.851 --> 00:24:13.721 position:21% line:83% align:start
they'd seal their own
sister under a mountain?

00:24:13.754 --> 00:24:15.923 position:21% line:83% align:start
His actions left the
marriage destroyed,

00:24:15.957 --> 00:24:17.892 position:21% line:89% align:start
and a family in ruin!

00:24:17.925 --> 00:24:21.128 position:27% line:89% align:start
[monkey laughing]

00:24:21.629 --> 00:24:24.765 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yang Jian, do you recall
the day you arrested

00:24:24.799 --> 00:24:25.833 position:27% line:89% align:start
the three of us?

00:24:25.866 --> 00:24:27.535 position:30% line:89% align:start
All that power.

00:24:28.703 --> 00:24:32.173 position:24% line:83% align:start
Today I can finally
pay you back for that.

that one day I'd be the one

low profile these last 12 years.

Ever since the
Mount Hua incident.

a bounty hunter, I see.

a name earlier.

-Oh, the bounty.
-The guy's ours!

00:25:31.899 --> 00:25:34.168 position:7% line:89% align:start
We're both after the same man.

00:25:34.201 --> 00:25:37.071 position:13% line:83% align:start

for your sake.

But if you can put
them all back together,

it'll be as good as new.

you'll be able to use the lamp

to crack open Lotus Peak
and save your mother.

I remember the story.

01:38:07.221 --> 01:38:08.989 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was Yin Hong's master
who turned his apprentice

01:38:09.022 --> 01:38:10.391 position:38% line:89% align:start
to ashes.

Yang Jian,

01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:21.435 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can not allow Chenxiang
to split Mount Hua.

01:38:21.468 --> 01:38:22.503 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's all...

01:38:23.237 --> 01:38:24.505 position:16% line:89% align:start
to protect Jin Xia Cave.

01:38:26.306 --> 01:38:27.975 position:27% line:89% align:start
So you know now.

01:38:29.376 --> 01:38:31.979 position:30% line:83% align:start
We cannot allow
the cave to fall.

01:38:32.279 --> 01:38:35.949 position:10% line:83% align:start

to preserve Jin Xia Cave.

Why can't you understand that?

01:38:38.152 --> 01:38:39.219 position:38% line:89% align:start
So then,

the last to split
Mount Hua was you.

01:39:47.622 --> 01:39:51.626 position:35% line:83% align:start
This round,
it's Chenxiang's turn.

[Jian laughing]

01:40:00.334 --> 01:40:01.368 position:41% line:89% align:start
Master.

01:40:02.604 --> 01:40:04.171 position:10% line:89% align:start
You took me in as an orphan.

01:40:05.372 --> 01:40:08.075 position:16% line:83% align:start
Raised me as one of
your holy disciples.

01:40:08.510 --> 01:40:10.210 position:24% line:83% align:start
Taught me all sorts
of different magic.

01:40:11.679 --> 01:40:13.681 position:5% line:89% align:start
And all for the purpose of using

01:40:13.715 --> 01:40:15.550 position:21% line:83% align:start
so that I could split
Mount Tao one day.

01:40:17.719 --> 01:40:20.755 position:21% line:83% align:start
When you looked after
Chenxiang, you hid his powers,

01:40:20.788 --> 01:40:23.658 position:30% line:83% align:start
his origins and
everything from him.

01:40:23.691 --> 01:40:25.359 position:19% line:83% align:start
But this time it was to
keep him from splitting

01:40:25.392 --> 01:40:26.460 position:33% line:89% align:start
the mountain.

01:40:26.493 --> 01:40:27.529 position:38% line:89% align:start
Correct.

01:40:28.428 --> 01:40:30.397 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yang Jian,

01:40:30.430 --> 01:40:32.667 position:10% line:89% align:start
I am trying to preserve peace

01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:35.235 position:19% line:83% align:start
just as your mother did
before me.

01:40:36.203 --> 01:40:39.206 position:16% line:83% align:start
As long as the Phoenixes
remain under the mountain,

01:40:39.239 --> 01:40:41.275 position:13% line:89% align:start
the cave will also remain.

01:40:42.777 --> 01:40:45.547 position:21% line:83% align:start
Your precious cave is
destined to collapse.

01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:46.748 position:7% line:89% align:start
The longer they're suppressed,

01:40:46.781 --> 01:40:48.348 position:7% line:89% align:start
the more powerful they'll grow.

01:40:48.382 --> 01:40:50.117 position:24% line:83% align:start
When they're free,
they'll destroy the world.

01:40:50.885 --> 01:40:53.521 position:10% line:83% align:start
And protecting Jin Xia Cave,
it's not for the greater good,

01:40:53.555 --> 01:40:55.155 position:16% line:89% align:start
it's for selfish reasons!

01:40:55.557 --> 01:40:57.659 position:21% line:89% align:start
That cave is my life!

01:40:57.692 --> 01:41:00.762 position:16% line:83% align:start
The life of all disciples
who've passed through it.

01:41:00.795 --> 01:41:02.730 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's glory belongs to all.

01:41:03.565 --> 01:41:06.634 position:5% line:89% align:start
Harm to it is harm to all.

01:41:08.570 --> 01:41:12.472 position:24% line:83% align:start
