1
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:07,173
(static whirs)

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,063
(eerie theme music plays)

3
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,196
(ship horn sounds)

4
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,287
(ship horn sounds)

5
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,250
(seagulls coo)

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,924
(intense but chill music plays)

7
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,692
(applause from audience)

8
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,403
- Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen,

9
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,197
I'd like to be the first to welcome you to

10
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,116
the official completion ceremony

11
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,284
of the Tokyo Bay City Hotel.

12
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,913
As you know, not only does
Bay City have this hotel,

13
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,748
but an international convention center

14
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,667
and an amusement park as well.

15
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,336
All of these will be opening tomorrow.

16
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,340
(audience applauds)

17
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,597
- (whispering) Okay, so why
do you think Joe is so late?

18
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,349
- Yeah, and Falcon too.

19
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,184
- Well, Falcon's not
usually late like this,

20
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,770
so I'm willing to bet that at
least he's got a good excuse,

21
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,814
- (sighs) Maybe-

22
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:29,940
- (enthusiastically) But not that Joe,

23
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,359
he's probably accosting
girls in the lobby,

24
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,736
reciting poetry to them.

25
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,405
(ominously) He must die.

26
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,407
- Come back here.

27
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,618
- The entire complex is
controlled by a central computer,

28
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:45,122
which is located safely
underground beneath the hotel.

29
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,583
The computer is directly
linked to the Bay City network

30
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,793
and from there can access
communication bridges

31
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:50,794
throughout the world,

32
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,881
making this hotel a gateway to the future.

33
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,969
(crowd gasps and comment in awe)

34
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:03,682
- Not a single lecherous,
nookie hound in site.

35
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,018
Where are you, Joe?

36
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,646
(engaging dramatic music)

37
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,690
- Where is it? No that's not it.

38
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,151
(enthusiastically) Oh, whose are these?

39
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,987
(stammers)

40
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:20,991
Sure enough. That stupid
Marine's gone too, I'm screwed.

41
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,785
I can't believe I lost Corey's note.

42
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:27,539
(in agony) What am I going to
do for dinner? I'm starving.

43
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,251
Somebody tell me where the free food is!

44
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,129
(gasps) Ooh, babe.

45
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,590
Hey, you got some nice legs!

46
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,259
(loud bang)

47
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,553
- Thank you. I work out.

48
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,472
(stammering painfully)

49
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,765
- Oh, well you should stick with it.

50
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,892
You're getting results.

51
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,979
(truck whirs)

52
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,240
- Well, you've listened to me prattle on

53
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,866
about the truly amazing wonders

54
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,576
of Bay City long enough.

55
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,286
So why don't we live in this shindig up

56
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,997
a little bit with a special
toast. And after that,

57
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,875
please go ahead and partake
of the many wonderful dishes

58
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,627
we've prepared for you.

59
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,836
(applause)

60
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:15,797
- Ahh! Ooh!

61
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:17,714
- Connie. Let's give up on the guys,

62
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,884
attack the buffet and just
stuff ourselves silly.

63
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,387
- Great idea! Oh, that
looks good over there.

64
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,930
Ooh, you know we're
gonna need some of these!

65
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:29,101
- A toast to the bright
future of Bay City. Kanpai!

66
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,602
- (crowd) Kanpai!

67
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,439
(trucks whirring)

68
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,277
- Deliveries, go around the back.

69
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,904
What are you people loading in any way?

70
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:45,868
(grunt) (ominous music plays)

71
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,708
(men running and grunting)

72
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,548
- Hey, wait! Stop that.

73
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,633
(guns fired repeatedly)

74
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,970
(crew screaming in agony)

75
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,724
(elevator dings)

76
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,855
(bomb beeps)

77
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:21,903
- Who are you?

78
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:35,001
(ominous music cones to an end)

79
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,630
(guests chattering in the background)

80
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,008
- Alright, some carbohydrates, alright.

81
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,220
And then a little protein
to balance that out.

82
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:50,390
Oh! Hello Mister Lobsta (laughs)

83
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,933
- Uh, Kori?

84
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:52,769
- What's up?

85
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,605
- Take it easy, would you?
Everyone's staring at us.

86
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,817
(laughing)

87
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,534
(indistinct chatter)

88
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:14,207
(ominous, jazzy music plays)

89
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:25,093
(people chattering in the background)

90
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,149
(woman panting)

91
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:52,327
- Hello? Where are you
rushing up to in such a hurry?

92
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,498
(car skids to a stop)

93
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,256
(grunt)

94
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,008
Why don't we go to a restaurant

95
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,136
and you can buy me some dinner.

96
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,013
- Let go, creep! I'm in a hurry.

97
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,642
- Are you running from somebody?

98
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,353
Don't worry, I can help you with that.

99
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:22,649
(whoosh) (grunts)

100
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,318
The hell's going on-

101
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,405
- Keep your hands off of this one.

102
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:32,243
- No way, I saw her first. Get your own!

103
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,454
Now, wait a second you big freak,

104
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,248
You already have Mickey. This one's mine!

105
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,002
(shouts in pain)

106
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:49,634
(slam on bricks) (vibrations sound)

107
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,304
- Joe. I'm serious. Leave her alone.

108
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,015
Well Falcon, you're leaving me no choice

109
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,100
but to use this!

110
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,518
(grunting in agony)

111
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,853
- Get down.

112
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,772
(meow)

113
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,235
(bang) (grunting)

114
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,696
- Hey wait, I think she likes you!

115
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,698
Please, Falcon, I'll take the girl

116
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,700
and you can pet the puddy tad.

117
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,786
- Get off me, right now!

118
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,875
(car skids to a stop)

119
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,668
- Shit! Wait!

120
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,963
- Out of my way!

121
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,799
- Ahh, what the hell!?

122
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,803
Stop it! (grunts) (cinematic music plays)

123
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,222
What do you think you're doing?

124
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,598
You're completely trashing my car.

125
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,392
- Heh, Your car's trash anyway.

126
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:42,021
- Yeah, but it's my piece of trash.

127
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:46,859
Whoa! (crashing) My poor car!

128
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:51,030
- If you're coming along, I
suggest you hang on tight.

129
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:58,162
(action music plays in background) - Whoa!

130
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:04,292
Hey! Where the hell
did you learn to drive?

131
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,628
- Would you like to drive for a while?

132
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,339
- Would you like to kiss my-Whoa!

133
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,722
(computer keys clicking)

134
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,641
- So, who the hell were those two?

135
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,435
- Falcon and City Hunter. Nobodies.

136
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,729
- Damn it! The mission has been leaked.

137
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,982
Hasn't it, Claude?

138
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,359
- The mission is going perfectly well,

139
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,611
except that they are following us.

140
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:35,907
- What!? Do something. get rid of them!

141
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,285
- Don't be concerned. General Gilliam.

142
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,288
We have made arrangements for them.

143
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,208
(cars whizzing by)

144
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,172
- Huh, this place.

145
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:57,971
(short metallic clanging)

146
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:02,935
- What? (intense music)
(tanks shooting) Ahh!

147
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,191
(yelling) Do something!

148
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,901
- (loudly) I'm driving the car.

149
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,862
Go ahead and kill them!

150
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:18,783
- (shouting) Now there's
a bright idea! Whoa!

151
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:23,789
Ahh! (water splashes loudly)

152
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,341
- Target has been eliminated.

153
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,384
- Good, secure the bridge.

154
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,385
- Roger.

155
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:46,686
(water splashing softly)

156
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,814
- I wonder if Falcon made
it out of there all right.

157
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:53,319
Well, if not, that's what he
gets for chasing off my woman.

158
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:58,491
(eerie flute carnival music)

159
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,872
- Hey, let's eat this now,

160
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,040
while we've got time.

161
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,210
- Yeah. This is Area F five.

162
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,462
It wasn't enforced on
us, nah, they've taken-

163
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,631
- We had totally good
food back at the hotel.

164
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:18,093
- F five out. (grunt in confusion)

165
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,969
- Hey!
- Hey!

166
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,432
- (muffled) Thanks for the snack!

167
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,310
- He stole our food! (guns shot)

168
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,729
- Mmm, delicious!

169
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,900
(walkie talkie beeping)

170
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,320
- G4.

171
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,780
- Intruder in Area F five

172
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:42,325
- That's impossible. Is he
armed? Describe him to me?

173
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,828
- Male, dark hair, is
really, really hungry.

174
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,498
- Just kill him and don't bother me.

175
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:53,211
- Oh, okay!

176
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,922
Woo. Nookie, right on!

177
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:59,009
- Intruder! (guns shooting)
(exclaiming in pain)

178
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,889
What is their problem?

179
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,726
Well, I guess Falcon's still alive.

180
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,812
(whooshing)

181
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,314
(explosion) - No!

182
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,651
(gun shots)

183
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,404
- Area F seven.

184
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,532
We're being attacked by a huge bald guy.

185
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,868
(gun shoots)

186
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,579
- Gomez. We have a minor problem.

187
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,621
Deal with it.

188
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,622
- Right.

189
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:40,133
- We don't want to upset
the party goers just yet.

190
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,969
(giggling)

191
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,972
- I'd like to thank you again
for your generous invitation.

192
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,640
Oh no. It's my pleasure.

193
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,643
I've enjoyed being a
patron at your restaurant.

194
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,229
By the way, where's that large
gentleman that works for you?

195
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,982
- Well, he was supposed to have been here,

196
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,860
but I'm sure something
important must've come up.

197
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:02,656
- Ooh, Mickey, look at the fireworks!

198
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,622
- Fireworks? But no
fireworks were planned.

199
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,666
- We have a situation
here. Get the lights on.

200
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,667
- (both) Sir!

201
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:18,130
(crank sounds)

202
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:22,092
(confused grunts)

203
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,896
(gun shots sounding loudly)

204
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:39,567
- Ahh!

205
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:45,658
(screaming in fear) (loud crash)

206
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:53,040
Ahh! (loud crashing noises)

207
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,837
Okay. That's enough hangin'
around for one evening.

208
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,965
Back on nookie patrol!

209
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,719
- Stop screwing around and start fighting

210
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,638
- Hey, where's that girl?

211
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,306
- It won't matter If you're dead.

212
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,850
- If you want me to help you,

213
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,269
you have to tell me her name.

214
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,356
- Her what? Don't you
mean the name of her army?

215
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,860
- Falcon. Falcon, come in, please.

216
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,446
- Was that Sandra? Tell me
you're not working for her now.

217
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:28,742
- Shut up. (shots being fired)

218
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,250
- Falcon. Come in, please.

219
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,085
I need a status report.

220
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:42,255
- Oh, let me guess,
she's blackmailing you?

221
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,464
- Damn you!

222
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,842
- Hey, Sandra, what's up?

223
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,928
- Joe, is that you? (groaning)

224
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,098
- Nothing report just yet.

225
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,558
- I'm cool.

226
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,810
- Now, just hold still a minute.

227
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,396
(gun shots) (frightened shouting)

228
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,899
- Why is Joe there?

229
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,195
(indistinct chatter in background)

230
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,405
What do you think's going on down there?

231
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,573
- Can't tell.

232
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,866
- Wait here.

233
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:14,872
(guns being shot) (exclaiming in fear)

234
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,958
- Don't hesitate to
shoot anyone who resists.

235
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,336
- Move away from there.
Let's go, right now.

236
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,629
- Muévete!

237
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:27,635
(intense music) (hyeah) (grunting)

238
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,554
- Now just to the hell are you?

239
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,140
- Ah, so brave for a woman.

240
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:37,393
- Call them off or I'll fire. I mean it!

241
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,228
- I am sure you do,

242
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:42,483
but please allow yourself the
opportunity to reconsider.

243
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,947
(intense music plays)

244
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,576
Now, hand over to your weapon.

245
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,329
Don't make us have to hurt you.

246
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,751
And now as for you.

247
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,003
- (giggles) Who me?

248
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:07,423
(guns being shot)

249
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,509
- Hey, so come on, tell me.

250
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,637
What kind of dirt does
that Sandra have on you?

251
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,013
- Shut up.

252
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,682
- Could this have anything to do with you

253
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,351
ogling her while she's naked?

254
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,854
- (sneezes) That's strange.
I just got chills all over.

255
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,190
- Stay out of this, you asshole!

256
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,150
- I'm going to have to tell Mickey.

257
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,902
- Of course, that assumes
I don't kill your first

258
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,278
to shut you up.

259
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,448
- I'll keep your secret. If
you tell me the girl's name,

260
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,826
- Why are you still talking about Luna?

261
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,161
(guns shooting)

262
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,039
- Ahh, Luna. Such a lovely name!

263
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,710
- Get back here, you perverted
piece of worthless trash.

264
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,962
- You're just afraid of competition!

265
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,673
You wanna be the on;y one to rescue her!

266
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,675
- Afraid? No one will be scared of you

267
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,804
when you're full of holes.
(shooting) (explosion)

268
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,695
- Two weeks have passed since
General Gilliam successfully

269
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,322
avoided capture by the
United States military.

270
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,616
Meanwhile, sources close to
the Pentagon have confirmed

271
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,036
that the general was indeed responsible

272
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,663
for the recent takeover
of the custodial Republic.

273
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,623
The U S government has indicted Gilliam

274
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,751
for his involvement in a smuggling ring,

275
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:28,087
responsible for bringing
over 70,000 tons of drugs

276
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:31,090
into the United States
over the last five years.

277
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,384
Unconfirmed reports indicates that Gillian

278
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,762
may have fled to an overseas country

279
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,724
to avoid the latest attempt
to capture and extradite him.

280
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,186
- It's a bit noisy outside.

281
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:46,522
- A slight problem with
some uninvited guests.

282
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,983
- It doesn't affect our plan, does it?

283
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,360
- You don't need to
worry about a thing, sir.

284
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,905
It will be finished soon.

285
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,240
- Hostages?

286
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,658
- Yes. They've got the guests

287
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,536
from the grand opening
trapped in the hotel.

288
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,580
- Damn, that means we can't afford

289
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,791
even the slightest screw up.

290
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:09,504
(car honks loudly) (car
skids to a stop violently)

291
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,839
- I'm Norton. CIA.

292
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,758
Why are all you people standing around

293
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,551
when we know Gilliam's location?

294
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:16,969
- There are hostages.

295
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,054
- Hostages?

296
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,473
- Yes. And we'd like for
them to live through this.

297
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:24,519
So do me a favor and don't
rush into anything foolish.

298
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,270
(grunts)

299
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,191
(electronic sound)

300
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,405
(keyboard clicking)

301
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,949
- I was good at-

302
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,536
(guns blazing)

303
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:47,584
(intense action music playing) (explosion)

304
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,366
- You hear that?

305
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,451
- What is that sound?

306
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,870
- It's Falcon's gun.

307
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,246
- Falcon is here?

308
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,290
- An excellent deduction.

309
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,875
Yes, indeed.

310
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:32,753
That the City Hunter and Falcon
making the ruckus outside.

311
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,965
And you are their partners, yes?

312
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:47,102
(explosion) (gun shots)

313
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,606
(intense music plays)

314
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:59,031
(walkie talkie beeps) (gun shot)

315
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,703
(screams in agony)

316
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,594
- Still looking for action?

317
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,639
- You're persistent.

318
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,693
- They took the guests hostage.

319
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,946
Just what the hell are
they planning to do?

320
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,449
And I'm not seeing Luna anywhere!

321
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,745
(walkie talkie beeps)

322
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,747
- I'll kill you!

323
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,221
(grunting)

324
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,484
- Ahh!

325
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,823
- Don't do that, or
they're going to find me.

326
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:24,949
Hi guys.

327
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,826
Who's this?

328
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:27,451
He's not exactly dressed for the party.

329
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:31,205
He's-he might be one of
the intruders outside.

330
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,915
Hey you, get up!

331
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:33,916
- Yeah, sure.

332
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,762
Who are these guys?

333
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,222
- I believe they're terrorists

334
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:51,100
serving under General
Gilliam from Custodial.

335
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,435
- General Gilliam?

336
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,895
The dictator that the
Americans are looking for?

337
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,814
- Ah, yes, you're right.

338
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,733
- By the way,

339
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,191
do you know anything about a woman

340
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,818
they kidnapped named the Luna?

341
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,945
- No, but two women,

342
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,948
one named Mickey and one named
Corey were taken away from

343
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,284
here just a little
while ago by an officer.

344
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:11,830
- Oh, Kori and Mickey? This
must be where they went.

345
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,791
Amazing. So what's this
place called again?

346
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,418
The Babe City Hotel?

347
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,378
- Um, Excuse me?

348
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,339
- Wait, this food's free, right?

349
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,840
- Sure. Dig in!

350
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,467
- Ah, nothing!

351
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:28,388
Oh, my dinner's gone.

352
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:33,477
I wonder... Presto change-o.

353
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,521
Thank you, Kori!

354
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,817
This looks great. Man. I'm starving!

355
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,572
(slurps)

356
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,948
So good.

357
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:50,659
- Sorry. I don't mean to
disturb you while you're busy,

358
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,329
but would you mind if we were to run away?

359
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,290
- No, but the Bay Bridge
is crawling with soldiers.

360
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:59,877
So you might want to just try
the basement or something.

361
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,213
- Uh, thanks.

362
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:10,888
- Die!

363
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,518
Ahh!

364
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:41,294
(walkie talkie sounds)

365
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,174
- Gomez, where are you? Answer me!

366
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,260
- Can I help you?

367
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,220
- Where's Gomez?

368
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:51,762
- He's getting some beauty sleep?

369
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,764
Can I take a message?

370
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:57,893
- Is this Falcon. Perfect?

371
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,813
That is something you should hear.

372
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:01,772
- Falcon!

373
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,861
Falcon, don't listen
to this guy. I'm fine.

374
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,905
- Did you hear her? Even though
her life hangs by a thread,

375
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:13,076
she'd still so brave,
but it doesn't matter.

376
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,620
We're in room number 3508

377
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:20,541
If you wish to see her
alive, be here in 10 minutes.

378
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,544
If you are late, she
dies in the explosion.

379
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,087
- What?

380
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,088
- Yeah.

381
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:38,226
(panting)

382
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:54,409
- K, V Alpha, Sierra

383
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,163
Romeo. Dell.

384
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:00,789
X-ray Charlie.

385
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,588
Mike, Charlie golf.

386
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,846
- (British accent) I didn't
know, you were one of them.

387
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,349
Luna, Gilliam.

388
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,569
- Damn it!

389
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,658
- You waited too long and do anything.

390
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,910
So we've taken the initiative.

391
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,288
- You're going to get those men killed!

392
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:50,799
- Hey! Hey!

393
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,718
I didn't know.

394
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,846
- We did, perhaps you'll
trust us in the future.

395
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,558
The Pentagon's offered to
pay for any of your expenses.

396
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,644
Why don't you people
get in the game somehow?

397
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:07,314
- We're already in the
game. Just be patient.

398
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,607
- What do you mean?

399
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:11,653
- I mean, we wait and we hope.

400
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,533
- Why don't you tell me what
the general is planning?

401
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,953
- My father is going to take
his revenge against America.

402
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,621
- What kind of revenge?

403
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,249
They're forced my father from
power and now he will do the

404
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,250
same to them.

405
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,213
Hey, you came here looking for me.

406
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,506
Didn't you?

407
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,507
Wow.

408
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,719
You know, I would be so grateful.

409
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,015
If you could use your skills
to help protect my father.

410
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,144
I don't know how I could ever repay you.

411
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,068
- Tell me where I can find my friends.

412
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,864
- Soon you'll find your
friends all over the place.

413
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,240
- Where? Tell me!

414
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,492
- The 35th floor.

415
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,912
That freight elevator
only goes to the roof.

416
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,165
You won't make it.

417
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,170
Don't you want to be on the winning side?

418
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,550
- Grenade!

419
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,940
(explosions)

420
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,001
- Oh! Who's there?

421
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,674
(glass breaking)

422
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,384
- Where is she?

423
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,009
- They took her somewhere downstairs.

424
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,136
- This it?

425
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,930
- No, Joe, wait, the bed.

426
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,396
- Mickey?

427
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:53,273
- Falcon, the door's wired.

428
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,608
- Blow out the wall!

429
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,409
- Falcon!

430
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:30,769
(screams) (explosion)

431
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,611
- What the hell was-

432
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,280
Just what the hell did you do?

433
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,283
- Nothing, but I'm
pretty sure of one thing.

434
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,119
The situation clearly
seems to be changing.

435
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,454
- Not good enough.

436
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,915
You think I can risk the
welfare of the United States

437
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,750
on a worthless answer like that?

438
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:55,918
- If you're that worried,

439
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,045
why don't you shut down
your defense network

440
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:01,423
until this is over with. That
would solve your big problem.

441
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:04,843
- No, there's no way. It can't be done.

442
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,845
- Then it would appear,

443
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,764
you still have to trust me.

444
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,432
- Well, you've earned it.

445
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,433
I guess.

446
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,233
- Kayla Sierra, odell, echo alpha

447
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,277
- Luna, you done?

448
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,695
- Papa, calm down.

449
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,155
There are three sequences left

450
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,618
before I can access their
defense system. I'm very close.

451
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,245
- Do you really think you can hack into

452
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,038
the US's defense network and

453
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,040
reprogram all the missile codes?

454
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,500
Not while I'm still around.

455
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,252
I'm gonna talk.

456
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,881
- Actually my dear, we'll
probably kill you first.

457
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:57,688
- They're trying to hack into

458
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,107
the Pentagon strategic defense system.

459
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:03,569
Luna can make the base city
net look like a friendly.

460
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:07,698
- So I guess that makes Luna
some sort of expert with codes.

461
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,783
- What kind of expert are you?

462
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,369
- Self-control, you see!

463
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:19,877
- Juliette or Scott X. Day.

464
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,212
Yankee. Zulu.

465
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,639
I got through!

466
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,183
All we have left is to select our targets.

467
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,185
- Good job. Luna.

468
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,980
The Americans will suffer
as their own missiles

469
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,650
rain down upon their meddling country.

470
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:47,405
(giant explosion sound)

471
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,533
(laughs mischievously)

472
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,160
- American aggressors,

473
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,412
you will receive this final judgment

474
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,498
from the all powerful Dinah.

475
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,541
- He's crazy.

476
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,880
- Kori's in danger, We
don't have time for this!

477
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,049
- Oh, come on!

478
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,481
(explosion)

479
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,531
- Joe, she's in the
underground computer room.

480
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,532
- Right.

481
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:44,544
(electronic sounds)

482
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,505
- At last! Another few minutes

483
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,632
and I'll finally have my revenge.

484
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,968
- We have to do now with
wait for the missile launch

485
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:55,555
confirmation, evacuate the
quota and then blow it up.

486
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,598
- Blow it up?

487
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:00,228
- Yes. We'd have to
eliminate any evidence.

488
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,021
- No! Please don't!

489
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,774
- I'm citing my idea.

490
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,452
- Your service has been
impeccable, Major Claude.

491
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,704
- General.

492
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,080
Sir, why?

493
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,623
- Once our task is done,

494
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:23,917
the best chance for
escape is if the Americans

495
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:27,796
think that responsible
parties died in the explosion.

496
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:30,382
- If you kill everyone, then won't you-

497
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,925
Even the men?

498
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:35,053
- Wherever that, where
you won't be lonely.

499
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,054
- Stop!

500
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,397
- Papa, I'm ready to fire now.

501
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,942
- Excellent. Go ahead.

502
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:51,445
- No, Luna! What are you doing this for?

503
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,280
- Shut up!

504
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:53,989
- Luna, it's wrong and you know it!

505
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,991
Don't do it!

506
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,747
- Adiós, America.

507
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,836
- Don't touch the keyboard. Luna.

508
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,094
You know that you're a
better person than this.

509
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,219
Are you okay?

510
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,262
- Yeah

511
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:20,599
- Hiding all that food
before, splendid plan.

512
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,642
(laughs obnoxiously)

513
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:23,936
What are you laughing at?

514
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,354
- When I hit the button,

515
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,191
the bombs we've set in
this hotel would blow it

516
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,319
and everything in it to kingdom come.

517
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:34,906
Luna fire the missiles.

518
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:35,823
- Stop!

519
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,658
Why are you risking your life with this?

520
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,997
- You sure talk big,

521
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:46,167
but I know you can't shoot a woman.

522
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,819
(huge explosion sounds)

523
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,863
(computer malfunction sounds) (static)

524
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,365
- It shut down!

525
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,368
- The computer's ruined!

526
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,411
- Works a whole lot better

527
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,664
if you just shoot the machine.

528
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,915
- That's kids stuff

529
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,000
- So, good thing an
expert like me showed up.

530
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:33,046
I guess it was too much for
our rookie lock you to handle

531
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:36,466
- This is your stupid
mission. You're lucky I'm here

532
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,385
- I don't think anyone's
going to feel lucky

533
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:43,391
when I blow you all to hell.

534
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:50,897
- Papa!

535
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:56,821
- Come with me!

536
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:57,821
- Papa!

537
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:14,714
(intense explosions)

538
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,313
- That's-that's huge.

539
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,524
I've never seen an explosion that huge.

540
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:04,095
- Mr. Norton, your leadership
here was exceptional.

541
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,264
You'll probably receive a double promotion

542
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,308
back in the states.

543
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,809
- You know? I want to thank you.

544
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:13,064
And all the other little people
who helped me get this far.

545
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:23,573
- I guess Joe and the others
got out of there okay.

546
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,574
- Hey, Ms. Nogami.

547
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,409
- Yes?

548
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,160
- I don't know what kind
of magic you worked,

549
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:30,206
but I'd like to express my
appreciation to you somehow.

550
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,333
- Well, I don't think that's necessary.

551
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:35,168
I think the bill for the hotel
will be quite sufficient.

552
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:37,879
- Whoa. Are you saying
the US is responsible

553
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,422
for all the damages?

554
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,882
- Didn't you say something before

555
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:43,844
about the Pentagon offering
to cover all the expenses?

556
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,014
(chuckles sheepishly)

557
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:50,935
- I am so fired. My raise, my promotion.

558
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:03,029
- Hey Joe, if Falcon didn't
blow up the computer.

559
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,782
Do you think you would
have actually shot Luna?

560
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:06,783
- Who knows.

561
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,038
Falcon, step into my office.

562
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:18,837
- What do you want?

563
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,047
- Sandra's a tricky
little Minx, isn't she?

564
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,425
She shifted all her
responsibilities onto you.

565
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,511
And then I ended up
having to work for free.

566
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,221
Then you take the cake.

567
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:31,349
You let yourself become
Sandra's little errand boy,

568
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:34,769
just cause you caught a
glimpse of some big tits.

569
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,187
(noises of annoyance)

570
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:39,482
- I didn't see a thing,
but she said that I did.

571
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,318
- Come on.

572
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:42,569
Tell me exactly what happened.

573
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,031
- Well, it was about two days ago.

574
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,867
She had something important to tell me.

575
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,537
So we met at the pool side of the hotel.

576
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,377
All right. I'm here.

577
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,379
What's so important?

578
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,964
- What do you mean?

579
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:05,258
I didn't ask you to come here.

580
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,302
- What? get back here.

581
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,971
- Ah! What'd you do?

582
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,265
- S-sorry.

583
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:12,099
- You looked.

584
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,224
- No, I promise.

585
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,225
- Did too.

586
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:15,644
And you touched them.

587
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,688
- Did I really touched them?

588
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,690
- All right. Here's how I'll allow you

589
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,275
to make this up to me.

590
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,444
A certain general has a certain daughter.

591
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,280
Bring her in and we're even.

592
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,825
- I can't believe that tricky
bitch had this all planned

593
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,744
from the very beg ginning!

594
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,537
- Hey, man, that's what she does.

595
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,541
Wow. Don't worry. I won't
say anything to Mickey.

596
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,542
- Thank you.

597
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:43,046
- No problem. It's a male bonding thing.

598
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,422
Okay.

599
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,383
(chuckles childishly)

600
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,051
Hey, Mickey! (grunt)

601
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,970
Did you hear, Falcon
squeezed Sandra's tits.

602
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:51,931
He just told me so.

603
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:54,557
What the hell did I just tell you?

604
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,185
She tricked me, you son of a bitch!

605
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,812
- Ah, just kidding!

606
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,231
No, hey, hey, no!

607
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:04,193
(explosion sounds)

608
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,864
(funky music plays)
