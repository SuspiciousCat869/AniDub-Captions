1
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:26,400
The warp of a loom is like the flow of time.

2
00:01:27,368 --> 00:01:29,375
It changes seasons,

3
00:01:29,462 --> 00:01:31,586
dyes the sky anew.

4
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:34,801
The weft comprises a man's deeds,

5
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:37,722
their tread upon the earth,

6
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:39,881
the shift of their heart

7
00:01:40,388 --> 00:01:43,482
and the morph weave the days together.

8
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,754
Weaving the story of their world

9
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:50,833
through the many long centuries of their life.

10
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:07,093
Maquia!

11
00:02:11,562 --> 00:02:12,613
Leilia!

12
00:02:14,188 --> 00:02:16,068
What are you doing down there?

13
00:02:16,234 --> 00:02:18,771
We're never going to finish with you playing around.

14
00:02:20,405 --> 00:02:21,681
Jump in, Maquia!

15
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:23,950
You can do it, just fly!

16
00:02:25,326 --> 00:02:27,822
I... I can't.

17
00:02:30,496 --> 00:02:31,818
You're scared.

18
00:02:34,585 --> 00:02:37,801
It's all right. Better not to
get caught up in her mischief.

19
00:02:38,006 --> 00:02:39,215
You're right.

20
00:02:39,966 --> 00:02:40,938
That Leilia,

21
00:02:41,484 --> 00:02:43,292
she will never learn.

22
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,138
Those that make a life of weaving this cloth,

23
00:02:56,485 --> 00:02:59,501
far from the lands of man, have a name...

24
00:03:01,362 --> 00:03:03,448
"the Clan of the Separated".

25
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,912
Is something the matter, Lady Racine?

26
00:03:12,884 --> 00:03:13,884
Nothing.

27
00:03:15,678 --> 00:03:18,296
Just you wait, next time you're going in, too.

28
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,122
Mother!

29
00:03:25,197 --> 00:03:26,511
Welcome home.

30
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:30,224
Leilia you mustn't treat the cloth like that.

31
00:03:30,512 --> 00:03:31,684
Sorry, Mama.

32
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,820
Now why exactly are you all wet?

33
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:36,092
Did you find any good flowers, Father?

34
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:38,568
Indeed, these will make a rich violet.

35
00:03:41,126 --> 00:03:43,572
See you later! Bye, Maquia!

36
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:45,012
See ya later.

37
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,082
See you later.

38
00:03:58,961 --> 00:03:59,990
A tear.

39
00:04:14,303 --> 00:04:16,354
Why are you crying, little one?

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,774
Because I'm alone.

41
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,079
Alone?

42
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,934
Even with me beside you?

43
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,530
No, elder, that's not what I...

44
00:04:27,073 --> 00:04:29,479
You always were quick to tears.

45
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:35,056
Maquia, do you know why we call
ourselves "the Clan of the Separated"?

46
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:35,835
Hmm?

47
00:04:36,425 --> 00:04:41,491
To outsiders, we are but fairytales,
we are longer lived than any other race,

48
00:04:41,584 --> 00:04:45,902
but despite that fact, we
seemingly remain eternally youthful.

49
00:04:47,385 --> 00:04:52,310
Only a few centuries past, an existence
such as ours would be commonplace,

50
00:04:52,843 --> 00:04:56,098
there was a clan that unfurled wings like a bird's,

51
00:04:56,352 --> 00:04:58,980
there were flowers that would sing at daybreak,

52
00:04:59,155 --> 00:05:02,967
leviathans would carry cargo across the seas.

53
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:07,506
But now, all of that magic,

54
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:10,463
that wonder, has departed the world.

55
00:05:13,283 --> 00:05:18,063
That is why the Separated must
always weave the Hibial cloth.

56
00:05:18,928 --> 00:05:21,497
You will never be alone here.

57
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:26,085
Memories dwindle and fade with the passing of years,

58
00:05:26,424 --> 00:05:29,243
the Hibial will always remember.

59
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:33,916
The people who enter and depart our lives,

60
00:05:34,262 --> 00:05:37,424
they weep within its fabric with you.

61
00:05:38,242 --> 00:05:40,828
They are weeping with me?

62
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:43,201
Maquia...

63
00:05:43,774 --> 00:05:46,402
if ever you must leave the lorph behind...

64
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:47,194
Huh?

65
00:05:48,321 --> 00:05:51,844
...if you should ever meet someone from the outside,

66
00:05:52,283 --> 00:05:54,752
you must never fall in love.

67
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:59,144
For if you fall to love, you'll be truly alone.

68
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:01,847
Oh, but if ll meet someone,

69
00:06:02,074 --> 00:06:04,502
then how could I be left alone?

70
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,672
Such is our fate,

71
00:06:07,122 --> 00:06:11,054
why we must always remain the Clan of the Separated.

72
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,452
Goodnight, elder.

73
00:06:15,806 --> 00:06:17,578
Sleep well, Maquia.

74
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:21,552
And be sure not to forget to weave your Hibial for today.

75
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:22,752
Of course.

76
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:01,769
Oh...

77
00:07:51,068 --> 00:07:52,653
They're blooming.

78
00:08:07,523 --> 00:08:09,083
Maquia?

79
00:08:18,902 --> 00:08:19,896
The Renato!

80
00:08:21,888 --> 00:08:23,517
Mezarte's attacking?

81
00:08:23,718 --> 00:08:26,913
Maquia, get the elder quickly!

82
00:08:31,942 --> 00:08:33,062
Elder Racine?

83
00:08:48,635 --> 00:08:50,375
Elder Racine!

84
00:08:53,464 --> 00:08:54,422
Elder?!

85
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:57,802
Anybody!

86
00:08:57,802 --> 00:09:00,679
The Renato are attacking! Protect the Hibial!

87
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,907
It looks like the rumors are true.

88
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:41,248
They really do look like children.

89
00:09:41,295 --> 00:09:44,623
Yeah, this must look great to a deviant like you.

90
00:09:44,932 --> 00:09:45,810
Silence.

91
00:09:47,226 --> 00:09:48,338
Commander Izol.

92
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,656
Who leads this village?

93
00:10:09,324 --> 00:10:10,437
You're the elder?

94
00:10:11,405 --> 00:10:13,153
It is an honor to meet you.

95
00:10:13,815 --> 00:10:16,896
You may look like a young girl, but I know what you are.

96
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:20,885
The stories say you are a monster over 400 years old.

97
00:10:21,051 --> 00:10:24,727
You will find no monsters here, Commander, only weavers,

98
00:10:24,763 --> 00:10:26,967
who bind the cloth of days.

99
00:10:27,262 --> 00:10:29,535
Such is our fate and I shall not permit you...

100
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,373
I am afraid you have no choice in the matter.

101
00:10:33,053 --> 00:10:38,571
It is by order of the king you shall
accompany me to the palace of Mezarte.

102
00:10:39,111 --> 00:10:41,063
You won't lay a hand on Lady Racine.

103
00:10:43,772 --> 00:10:45,232
Take the women!

104
00:10:45,326 --> 00:10:46,831
You have your orders!

105
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:50,033
Kill any that try to resist!

106
00:11:06,716 --> 00:11:10,142
Forget the Renato, the lorph are all that matter!

107
00:11:19,073 --> 00:11:20,275
Let me out!

108
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:21,904
Please, let me out!

109
00:11:52,669 --> 00:11:53,727
Maquia!

110
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:13,781
No!

111
00:13:44,969 --> 00:13:46,543
Jump in, Maquia!

112
00:13:47,163 --> 00:13:49,360
You can do it, just fly!

113
00:14:31,115 --> 00:14:32,302
A baby?

114
00:14:32,435 --> 00:14:34,996
You know what I love about tear liquor?

115
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:39,359
It's got that extra salty kick to it.

116
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:40,486
Huh?

117
00:14:41,478 --> 00:14:43,355
You were that girl with the elder.

118
00:14:43,355 --> 00:14:44,950
You're Maquia, right?

119
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:48,193
I came to buy some Hibial but...

120
00:14:48,747 --> 00:14:50,362
...that didn't work out.

121
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:52,656
This place was a drifter's settlement.

122
00:14:52,741 --> 00:14:56,660
Got raided by bandits. This little guy was only hours old.

123
00:15:02,056 --> 00:15:05,228
That's pretty amazing. I guess that's what mothers do.

124
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:08,297
Even in death, she tries to protect her child.

125
00:15:08,297 --> 00:15:10,696
Well, leave the kid here.

126
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,495
They'll meet up again in heaven.

127
00:15:12,921 --> 00:15:16,076
The Hibial of this child's life will end here,

128
00:15:16,472 --> 00:15:20,026
little more than a frayed thread that was never woven in.

129
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:22,938
Better than being alone.

130
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:28,342
He's... he's really alone?

131
00:15:59,681 --> 00:16:02,267
Oh, she's...

132
00:16:03,143 --> 00:16:05,104
She's so strong.

133
00:16:05,435 --> 00:16:07,685
Come on now, don't do that.

134
00:16:15,823 --> 00:16:17,998
You're really going to take him with you?

135
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,099
He's not a toy.

136
00:16:21,145 --> 00:16:22,753
I know he's not a toy.

137
00:16:23,831 --> 00:16:24,969
He's my...

138
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,326
He's my Hibial.

139
00:16:31,818 --> 00:16:34,196
A lone child meets another lone child,

140
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,699
and so they set off into the world.

141
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:42,720
Are you cold?

142
00:16:53,758 --> 00:16:55,259
You smell funny.

143
00:16:57,155 --> 00:16:58,977
You smell like the sun.

144
00:17:01,827 --> 00:17:07,193
Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms

145
00:17:09,918 --> 00:17:11,526
You'll never take me alive!

146
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,100
Get back here!

147
00:17:13,848 --> 00:17:16,681
Lang, Deol, that's enough now.

148
00:17:18,526 --> 00:17:19,551
You didn't watch your back, Lang!

149
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:20,237
Get back here!

150
00:17:20,262 --> 00:17:21,570
I'm gonna get you!

151
00:17:21,595 --> 00:17:23,140
Those boys just never listen.

152
00:17:23,587 --> 00:17:24,261
Hm?

153
00:17:25,642 --> 00:17:26,913
What's wrong, Anora?

154
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:37,248
Huh?

155
00:17:42,517 --> 00:17:43,991
I don't understand.

156
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:44,886
What?

157
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,803
How do these... I don't know how these work.

158
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:51,196
I can't...

159
00:17:56,214 --> 00:17:57,600
What a mess.

160
00:17:57,749 --> 00:18:00,441
A child is not meant to raise another child.

161
00:18:06,078 --> 00:18:08,159
Is that baby even yours?

162
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:17,328
They say you can't tell how old
lorphs are by how they look. Is he yours?

163
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:20,906
Hey, off with the both of you.

164
00:18:21,813 --> 00:18:24,207
I'm-I'm 15.

165
00:18:24,894 --> 00:18:28,380
But the baby, he's... I don't know.

166
00:18:38,423 --> 00:18:39,644
What's his name?

167
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:41,091
I don't know.

168
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:47,578
Super weird and she's weird And the kid's weird

169
00:18:47,649 --> 00:18:48,569
Leilia!

170
00:18:50,773 --> 00:18:51,746
Leilia.

171
00:18:52,008 --> 00:18:55,942
But that's a girl's name. He should have a boy's name.

172
00:18:57,317 --> 00:18:59,820
Leili, Elli,

173
00:18:59,886 --> 00:19:01,019
Elia...

174
00:19:01,947 --> 00:19:03,381
Erial!

175
00:19:03,507 --> 00:19:04,047
Huh?

176
00:19:04,072 --> 00:19:04,967
Let go of me!

177
00:19:05,806 --> 00:19:08,107
Well, I suppose that'll do.

178
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,606
She's a distant relative.

179
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:16,607
She knows how to weave.

180
00:19:17,796 --> 00:19:19,009
Mmm...

181
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:29,060
There's a loom that's gone unused in the back of the shop.

182
00:19:29,224 --> 00:19:31,088
She's welcome to that.

183
00:19:35,912 --> 00:19:37,239
Take him outside.

184
00:19:39,838 --> 00:19:41,915
She's an lorph, isn't she?

185
00:19:42,386 --> 00:19:46,339
I never could trick you, Darel. I'm sorry.

186
00:19:48,827 --> 00:19:52,046
Lorph cloth fetches quite a high price.

187
00:19:52,164 --> 00:19:54,978
She'll end up making me a fair bit of coin.

188
00:19:55,105 --> 00:19:57,306
Don't worry, I won't say a word.

189
00:19:58,033 --> 00:19:59,337
Thank you, Darel.

190
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:02,685
However, you've taken in an lorph girl,

191
00:20:02,758 --> 00:20:05,260
trouble will be finding you soon enough.

192
00:20:05,728 --> 00:20:10,089
Maybe so, but no one can say
what the future will bring to us,

193
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:13,349
such is life, with or without her.

194
00:20:19,026 --> 00:20:21,109
Here you are, this week's freshest.

195
00:20:21,109 --> 00:20:23,695
Thank you as always, Mido.

196
00:20:23,878 --> 00:20:27,911
Mm! Your cheese has the most wonderful flavor.

197
00:20:28,091 --> 00:20:29,868
Oh, who's the new girl?

198
00:20:29,923 --> 00:20:31,554
I'll be back next week, thanks so much.

199
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:33,872
Just a good, solid, cheesy taste, you know?

200
00:20:33,897 --> 00:20:36,780
And the week after that. Farewell now.

201
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:40,821
You know, raising a child is never easy.

202
00:20:41,088 --> 00:20:43,204
Even I couldn't do it alone.

203
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:45,342
You do understand that?

204
00:20:45,554 --> 00:20:46,521
Mm.

205
00:20:46,885 --> 00:20:49,387
My husband passed on some time ago,

206
00:20:49,459 --> 00:20:51,833
killed by a Renato with the red eye.

207
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:56,905
I don't know.

208
00:20:57,751 --> 00:20:59,850
There's nothing wrong with that.

209
00:21:00,443 --> 00:21:03,172
I don't know what it means to be a mother.

210
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:04,767
I never...

211
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:07,217
had one.

212
00:21:07,784 --> 00:21:09,854
Well, it's all about guts.

213
00:22:23,899 --> 00:22:25,481
He's doing it!

214
00:22:25,722 --> 00:22:27,467
He can walk!

215
00:22:27,915 --> 00:22:29,255
Erial.

216
00:22:32,438 --> 00:22:34,191
Erial's walking!

217
00:22:34,284 --> 00:22:36,318
Erial can walk!

218
00:22:36,973 --> 00:22:38,379
Whoo-hoo!

219
00:22:40,285 --> 00:22:44,055
It looks like someone's become quite the mama.

220
00:22:46,463 --> 00:22:48,927
Am I really a mother?

221
00:22:50,206 --> 00:22:53,053
If you were a mother, I think you would know it.

222
00:22:53,881 --> 00:22:56,948
Did you boys clean up the goat
barn or spend all day fooling around?

223
00:22:56,973 --> 00:22:58,076
Lang, Mom's coming!

224
00:22:58,101 --> 00:23:00,188
We gotta go. Come on run!

225
00:23:02,395 --> 00:23:03,736
I'm sorry, Mom.

226
00:23:03,772 --> 00:23:05,023
We meant to do it.

227
00:23:05,109 --> 00:23:06,931
Oh, you will be sorry.

228
00:23:09,194 --> 00:23:10,427
Ow.

229
00:23:13,573 --> 00:23:16,409
Say "mommy", I know you can.

230
00:23:19,704 --> 00:23:21,508
Sorry, you don't have to.

231
00:23:21,831 --> 00:23:23,688
Mama.

232
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:26,567
Erial, did you just say...

233
00:23:29,297 --> 00:23:30,595
Say it again.

234
00:23:32,008 --> 00:23:33,821
Say it one more time.

235
00:23:41,393 --> 00:23:44,708
Another Renato has been stricken with the red eye.

236
00:23:46,296 --> 00:23:49,734
We shall put it down and
incinerate the body in quarantine,

237
00:23:49,906 --> 00:23:52,072
then bury it deep beneath the earth.

238
00:23:52,252 --> 00:23:54,543
Only five remain to us.

239
00:23:54,663 --> 00:23:57,367
Oh, what fresh hell is this?

240
00:23:57,448 --> 00:23:59,828
We need a cure and we need it now, my liege.

241
00:23:59,868 --> 00:24:02,443
The strength of the Renato is the symbol of Mezarte,

242
00:24:02,516 --> 00:24:04,644
it's the only force we can afford to deploy.

243
00:24:04,771 --> 00:24:08,586
When the last of the Renato falls,
the other kingdoms will not hesitate.

244
00:24:08,586 --> 00:24:13,393
Hmm... if they cannot be saved, we
will need a power to replace the Renato,

245
00:24:13,528 --> 00:24:16,456
something of equal wonder and
might that will keep them at bay.

246
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,887
Yes, of course!

247
00:24:17,887 --> 00:24:20,043
We have been granted the chosen blood.

248
00:24:20,068 --> 00:24:21,706
It will keep us safe.

249
00:24:22,026 --> 00:24:25,103
Commander, what of the lorph girl that you captured?

250
00:24:25,281 --> 00:24:28,420
How does she fare as consort to Prince Hazel?

251
00:24:31,026 --> 00:24:33,176
Tell me, please.

252
00:24:34,407 --> 00:24:36,433
If you all have wings...

253
00:24:37,765 --> 00:24:40,160
tell me, why you don't fly away?

254
00:24:45,406 --> 00:24:46,739
You're afraid

255
00:24:48,234 --> 00:24:50,500
you will wither and die here.

256
00:24:50,855 --> 00:24:54,396
All the emotion you trap inside will burn away,

257
00:24:54,466 --> 00:24:58,524
your heart will catch fire and you will burn to cinders.

258
00:24:58,618 --> 00:25:02,010
Lady Leilia, the king has summoned you.

259
00:25:02,925 --> 00:25:04,545
One moment more.

260
00:25:05,492 --> 00:25:08,813
Lady Leilia, why are you drawn here?

261
00:25:09,694 --> 00:25:12,547
It reminds me of the Hibial tower.

262
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:15,100
So it does.

263
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,525
It's done. Does it say anything?

264
00:25:33,591 --> 00:25:36,564
Yeah, it says, "Anora, feel better soon."

265
00:25:37,357 --> 00:25:38,459
Perfect!

266
00:25:38,659 --> 00:25:40,721
You know, back where Mama was born,

267
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,672
we'd use cloth to say how we felt instead of using words.

268
00:25:44,739 --> 00:25:46,434
Where were you born, Mom?

269
00:25:46,561 --> 00:25:49,048
Is it the same place I was born?

270
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:54,539
Dida's mom says you're different from
everybody else, but I don't think so.

271
00:25:56,152 --> 00:25:58,257
Where you were born, little Erial,

272
00:25:58,511 --> 00:26:02,951
everybody would talk with their tummies
before the tickling bug would get them.

273
00:26:03,016 --> 00:26:04,994
Tickle, tickle, tickle. Tickle, tickle, tickle.

274
00:26:04,994 --> 00:26:05,813
But, Mom.

275
00:26:05,838 --> 00:26:08,519
Then we'd fly away.

276
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:11,687
Anora!

277
00:26:12,001 --> 00:26:14,087
Be gentle with him, OK?

278
00:26:18,675 --> 00:26:20,573
Aren't you a lucky puppy?

279
00:26:21,433 --> 00:26:24,765
Anora's been here ever since Mom and Dad got married.

280
00:26:25,405 --> 00:26:29,060
That puppy is almost 90 years old in dog years.

281
00:26:39,696 --> 00:26:42,718
Hey, Erial, why's your mom so weird?

282
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:44,993
Why's she always sneaking around the village?

283
00:26:44,993 --> 00:26:47,749
She is not weird! My mommy.

284
00:26:47,956 --> 00:26:49,583
I mean, my mom is...

285
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:51,207
She's just...

286
00:26:52,297 --> 00:26:53,710
The baby can't talk.

287
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,962
And then he needs to run home to his mommy.

288
00:26:55,962 --> 00:26:57,964
You're the one who's weird, Erial.

289
00:26:57,964 --> 00:26:58,475
Huh?

290
00:26:58,514 --> 00:27:01,134
Boy's aren't supposed to like their moms, stupid.

291
00:27:01,188 --> 00:27:04,285
That's not true. You don't know.

292
00:27:04,518 --> 00:27:07,009
Dita, I hate you!

293
00:27:07,034 --> 00:27:08,600
I like my mom.

294
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:09,686
Oh, shut up, you.

295
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,106
I hate you! I hate you!

296
00:27:15,955 --> 00:27:17,215
Hmm.

297
00:27:18,568 --> 00:27:20,748
Wait, are you crying, Dita?

298
00:27:25,838 --> 00:27:29,497
Hmm, impressive work.

299
00:27:32,207 --> 00:27:34,250
Here, this month's pay.

300
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,919
Thank you so much, Darel.

301
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,863
Actually, I'd like you to take a look at something.

302
00:27:38,996 --> 00:27:44,100
A customer of mine brought in some true Hibial, here.

303
00:27:54,116 --> 00:27:55,180
Maquia?

304
00:27:55,465 --> 00:28:00,318
"Held within the castle. And to be wed to-to the prince.”

305
00:28:00,457 --> 00:28:02,410
It's beautiful.

306
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,283
Leilia!

307
00:28:09,858 --> 00:28:12,205
Don't worry, Darel will look into it.

308
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:14,707
If anyone can get you on a ship, it's him.

309
00:28:15,043 --> 00:28:16,626
Quiet, it's that Maquia girl.

310
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:19,787
Maybe it's for the best. For now at least.

311
00:28:20,978 --> 00:28:22,831
What are you going to do with Erial?

312
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,657
Huh?

313
00:28:24,957 --> 00:28:29,168
The journey won't be easy, ever
more so with a young child in tow.

314
00:28:29,288 --> 00:28:33,103
Besides, you have more than a journey ahead.

315
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,646
You know I'd gladly watch over him.

316
00:28:36,743 --> 00:28:38,970
Mom! Mommy!

317
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,250
Erial!

318
00:28:53,626 --> 00:28:55,915
Don't dig too deep, OK?

319
00:28:55,915 --> 00:28:59,148
Just in case Anora wants to come back and...

320
00:28:59,262 --> 00:29:03,634
Dummy. You don't want wild animals to dig her up, right?

321
00:29:03,887 --> 00:29:05,138
It's time.

322
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:20,799
I won't be able to see her in the ground.

323
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:23,692
You can see her anytime you come here.

324
00:29:24,046 --> 00:29:26,960
But we won't be able to play together.

325
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,349
Tell her she's a good dog.

326
00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:32,515
She died in peace without any pain.

327
00:29:33,244 --> 00:29:35,747
And everybody is going to die, eventually.

328
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:41,044
Anora was born into a life where it
happens faster than it does for us.

329
00:29:46,061 --> 00:29:47,117
Maquia!

330
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,585
I'll go after her.

331
00:29:53,647 --> 00:29:56,956
Does... does everybody die?

332
00:29:57,446 --> 00:29:58,233
Yes.

333
00:29:58,305 --> 00:29:59,921
Even moms?

334
00:30:00,561 --> 00:30:01,661
Yes.

335
00:30:06,545 --> 00:30:09,797
Maquia! Hey, please wait.

336
00:30:15,528 --> 00:30:16,814
Erial.

337
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:20,269
Everyone, it's not fair.

338
00:30:20,603 --> 00:30:22,063
You'll all have to...

339
00:30:22,515 --> 00:30:25,749
You'll leave and I'll-I'll still be here.

340
00:30:27,149 --> 00:30:27,789
Maquia...

341
00:30:27,814 --> 00:30:32,927
I knew it would happen, I knew
it, but it's not fair, it's not.

342
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,059
It doesn't matter that it isn't fair.

343
00:30:39,903 --> 00:30:41,647
Stop crying!

344
00:30:42,147 --> 00:30:44,369
You'll be gone, too.

345
00:30:45,153 --> 00:30:48,334
Come on, you are Erial's mother, aren't you?

346
00:30:49,227 --> 00:30:51,942
Moms don't cry, you hear me?

347
00:30:52,073 --> 00:30:53,182
My mom wouldn't.

348
00:30:54,412 --> 00:30:57,894
So I know for sure that moms don't cry.

349
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,505
OK.

350
00:31:04,633 --> 00:31:05,767
Don't cry.

351
00:31:08,381 --> 00:31:09,823
I promise.

352
00:31:10,675 --> 00:31:11,745
Me too.

353
00:31:16,264 --> 00:31:17,267
Good night.

354
00:31:17,393 --> 00:31:18,661
Sleep well.

355
00:31:22,248 --> 00:31:23,479
Erial!

356
00:31:31,237 --> 00:31:33,090
You tried to wait up for me.

357
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:35,257
Let's get you to bed, OK?

358
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:45,300
You're getting big now, Erial,

359
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,243
but you still smell like the sun.

360
00:31:49,858 --> 00:31:52,172
I won't cry, OK?

361
00:31:52,383 --> 00:31:54,803
I will always be your mother.

362
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,587
We will always be together.

363
00:31:57,805 --> 00:31:59,240
I promise.

364
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:04,333
I'm really sorry, I didn't mean it. I'm really sorry.

365
00:32:04,378 --> 00:32:08,191
I'm sorry about everything. I really didn't mean...

366
00:32:10,316 --> 00:32:13,404
I'm really, really sorry and I wanna be friends again.

367
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:16,616
Um, Erial and his mom had to leave.

368
00:32:26,209 --> 00:32:28,398
You're sure you don't wanna say goodbye?

369
00:32:46,245 --> 00:32:47,572
I wanna see the ocean.

370
00:32:47,597 --> 00:32:49,771
Erial, come back! You can't!

371
00:32:51,401 --> 00:32:53,570
You told me you would be a good boy.

372
00:32:53,657 --> 00:32:57,631
Come back and stay with Mom.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

373
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:02,798
Maquia, is that you?

374
00:33:04,956 --> 00:33:07,228
Oh, I can hardly believe you're alive.

375
00:33:07,415 --> 00:33:10,503
I never thought I'd see you again.

376
00:33:17,156 --> 00:33:18,667
It was our blood.

377
00:33:18,846 --> 00:33:22,386
Mezarte attacked to discover the secret of our long life,

378
00:33:22,682 --> 00:33:24,365
that's why they came.

379
00:33:24,851 --> 00:33:26,778
Stole Leilia.

380
00:33:27,144 --> 00:33:29,901
Hey, Mom, who is he talking about?

381
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,534
You have him calling you his mother?

382
00:33:33,402 --> 00:33:36,335
No, it's not like that, I just...

383
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,577
I'm not angry, you're not wrong to.

384
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:43,034
It's just hard to forget what the elder used to say.

385
00:33:45,162 --> 00:33:47,270
I know, I haven't forgotten.

386
00:33:48,149 --> 00:33:50,146
As long as you know, Maquia.

387
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,518
Items for sale.

388
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:22,408
There's going to be a parade,

389
00:34:22,408 --> 00:34:24,809
a massive festival to celebrate the prince's wedding.

390
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:28,623
Two different processions, one
with the prince and one with Leilia,

391
00:34:28,623 --> 00:34:32,812
will leave from separate palaces,
both of them crossing this bridge.

392
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:35,867
Here, we'll stage an attack on the prince and his Renato,

393
00:34:36,193 --> 00:34:41,072
cause all the chaos we can, and when the guard
protecting Leilia weakens to support the prince,

394
00:34:41,135 --> 00:34:43,445
we take Leilia back.

395
00:34:44,455 --> 00:34:46,847
I wanna see the parade, too.

396
00:34:47,696 --> 00:34:50,629
I'm sorry, sweetheart, maybe next time.

397
00:34:50,795 --> 00:34:54,372
Mom, I wanna go home.

398
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,725
Erial.

399
00:34:57,109 --> 00:35:00,696
You don't act like the mommy I know when we're here.

400
00:35:08,287 --> 00:35:11,555
Erial, the tickle bugs are coming.

401
00:35:11,669 --> 00:35:15,062
Tickle, tickle, tickle. Tickle, tickle, tickle.

402
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:55,142
People of Mezarte, today the blood of
the lorph is bonded to the royal family.

403
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:57,586
The Renato and the lorph,

404
00:35:57,667 --> 00:36:00,840
these legends that endure unto our era,

405
00:36:01,324 --> 00:36:04,635
can join their power with Mezarte!

406
00:36:05,025 --> 00:36:10,474
We are the chosen people. Our dominion shall be infinite!

407
00:36:14,564 --> 00:36:19,233
Today will be a day to remember with
the marriage of my son Prince Hazel

408
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:25,797
and the lorph Princess Leilia, a new
legend shall be born unto us, unto Mezarte!

409
00:37:38,744 --> 00:37:39,944
That boy.

410
00:37:45,204 --> 00:37:46,884
What's happening?

411
00:37:54,286 --> 00:37:55,661
An assassin?

412
00:37:55,926 --> 00:37:57,682
They tried to kill the prince.

413
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,577
Leilia. Leilia.

414
00:38:15,023 --> 00:38:15,710
Hm?

415
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,310
Sorry, sir.

416
00:38:25,568 --> 00:38:27,265
I've missed you.

417
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,633
Maquia, what are you doing here?

418
00:38:32,932 --> 00:38:35,471
Not just me, Krim, too.

419
00:38:35,703 --> 00:38:37,121
Krim is here in the city?

420
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,886
We came to save you.

421
00:38:38,914 --> 00:38:40,839
Come on, everybody's waiting for...

422
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:42,179
Leilia?

423
00:38:43,211 --> 00:38:45,588
I'm sorry, I can't just leave.

424
00:38:46,093 --> 00:38:47,631
But why not?

425
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,570
I can't escape.

426
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,909
You can, you were the fastest of anybody.

427
00:38:54,022 --> 00:38:57,592
You can just fly over these
castle walls and be gone, Leilia.

428
00:39:07,164 --> 00:39:10,126
I can't... I can't see Krim again.

429
00:39:12,114 --> 00:39:13,374
But then you...

430
00:39:13,762 --> 00:39:14,863
Leilia, you...

431
00:39:14,888 --> 00:39:16,033
Your Highness!

432
00:39:17,101 --> 00:39:19,627
You have to run, Maquia, now!

433
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:22,041
But I... Leilia, no.

434
00:39:22,233 --> 00:39:26,086
Go now, I'll be OK. After all, I can fly, right?

435
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:27,801
Hold fast!

436
00:39:39,433 --> 00:39:40,588
My lady.

437
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:42,510
Get them.

438
00:39:42,535 --> 00:39:45,924
Hold! If you lay a finger on her...

439
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,201
As you wish, my lady.

440
00:40:06,043 --> 00:40:09,797
I can fly, I know it.

441
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:18,693
So, how big's the kid now?

442
00:40:20,074 --> 00:40:22,347
He should be about six or seven, yeah?

443
00:40:22,742 --> 00:40:26,088
So, how's the world treating ya?

444
00:40:27,731 --> 00:40:30,191
You're one of us. You're an lorph.

445
00:40:31,051 --> 00:40:32,319
Only about half.

446
00:40:32,508 --> 00:40:39,666
Racine, the elder, there's a reason she made
it taboo for any lorph to leave the village.

447
00:40:39,933 --> 00:40:41,559
She knew what would happen.

448
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,423
She knew the fate of those that are different.

449
00:40:45,405 --> 00:40:47,835
Humans always play the same part,

450
00:40:47,919 --> 00:40:50,379
first they stare, then they taunt.

451
00:40:51,261 --> 00:40:54,551
One day, they hate, eventually, they Kill.

452
00:40:55,237 --> 00:40:58,031
So, the Clan remains separated,

453
00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:01,811
and always just out of step with the rhythms of the world.

454
00:41:06,186 --> 00:41:08,420
Try to live an ordinary life.

455
00:41:27,605 --> 00:41:29,599
Krim, you're hurt.

456
00:41:35,428 --> 00:41:37,660
Would you take off the cloak for me?

457
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:45,851
What does it mean to be a child?

458
00:41:45,851 --> 00:41:46,702
What?

459
00:41:47,353 --> 00:41:49,670
What does it mean to be a mother?

460
00:41:51,815 --> 00:41:54,280
I wonder if I even know.

461
00:41:56,987 --> 00:42:00,560
At times, Mido would try to explain it.

462
00:42:01,247 --> 00:42:03,452
She'd help me out so much,

463
00:42:03,508 --> 00:42:06,154
sometimes I felt like a little sister,

464
00:42:06,496 --> 00:42:09,304
but that's not quite it.

465
00:42:10,255 --> 00:42:12,490
I know that I'm really happy

466
00:42:12,711 --> 00:42:16,298
whenever Erial laughs or smiles

467
00:42:16,402 --> 00:42:20,327
and when I look at him, everything
else in the world just falls away

468
00:42:20,386 --> 00:42:22,596
and I just wanna hold him...

469
00:42:22,596 --> 00:42:24,473
That makes no sense.

470
00:42:27,101 --> 00:42:29,607
Erial will die long before you.

471
00:42:31,491 --> 00:42:32,535
It's the truth.

472
00:42:32,856 --> 00:42:35,523
Erial is going to leave you alone.

473
00:42:40,388 --> 00:42:41,662
Don't make my mom cry!

474
00:42:41,687 --> 00:42:43,242
Erial, no! He's just...

475
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:45,132
I'll make you cry.

476
00:42:45,157 --> 00:42:47,317
Erial, please stop it.

477
00:42:47,454 --> 00:42:49,283
Can you protect him?

478
00:42:50,436 --> 00:42:53,762
Can you? When it really matters?

479
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:55,415
Huh?

480
00:43:15,038 --> 00:43:19,084
We will stay in Mezarte, we will save Leilia.

481
00:43:19,657 --> 00:43:22,247
You and your child will only get in the way.

482
00:43:23,382 --> 00:43:28,192
I am sorry, Maquia, this is goodbye.

483
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,120
Are we gonna go home?

484
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:35,328
No, we're not going home.

485
00:43:35,594 --> 00:43:37,269
But why not?

486
00:43:38,672 --> 00:43:42,301
We are going somewhere new, just the two of us.

487
00:43:42,474 --> 00:43:47,119
Somewhere brand new? You mean without
Mido or Lang or anybody from home?

488
00:43:48,223 --> 00:43:49,781
I'm sorry, Erial,

489
00:43:50,136 --> 00:43:53,020
I don't think you'll be able to see them again.

490
00:43:53,329 --> 00:43:57,274
Well, as long as I'm with you, I'm OK.

491
00:43:57,741 --> 00:43:58,868
Me too.

492
00:43:59,174 --> 00:44:01,316
I'm happy, as long as I'm with you.

493
00:44:01,876 --> 00:44:05,568
No chance, girlie. I know trouble when I see it.

494
00:44:05,657 --> 00:44:09,420
Can't have you running off when
whatever trouble it is comes knocking.

495
00:44:11,538 --> 00:44:12,124
Ohh!

496
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,064
Erial!

497
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,502
I'm so sorry!

498
00:44:16,502 --> 00:44:18,712
You brat! You'd better run!

499
00:44:18,712 --> 00:44:20,372
Don't come back!

500
00:44:20,432 --> 00:44:22,976
Mom's gonna try a few more places, all right?

501
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:24,617
You wait at the inn for me.

502
00:44:24,885 --> 00:44:27,125
Aww, I don't want to.

503
00:44:27,212 --> 00:44:29,306
Please, Erial, will you wait?

504
00:44:34,561 --> 00:44:36,326
I really can't thank you enough.

505
00:44:36,653 --> 00:44:39,134
The bar does all its best business at night.

506
00:44:39,166 --> 00:44:41,418
You'll probably be working pretty late.

507
00:44:41,443 --> 00:44:42,782
You don't mind?

508
00:44:43,162 --> 00:44:45,377
How late do you mean?

509
00:44:45,447 --> 00:44:46,944
Got a problem?

510
00:44:47,365 --> 00:44:50,077
Just, my son is... He's young.

511
00:44:50,248 --> 00:44:52,914
I'd rather not leave him alone if I don't have to...

512
00:44:53,688 --> 00:44:57,998
We just had another girl take off
with the same problem, you're too young.

513
00:44:58,252 --> 00:44:59,697
You'd better think about this.

514
00:44:59,744 --> 00:45:01,017
But you don't...

515
00:45:01,177 --> 00:45:02,504
Don't what?

516
00:45:02,704 --> 00:45:06,325
Tell me, you need to be a better
example than this to your child!

517
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:11,691
Go on then, I don't have any work for someone like you.

518
00:45:27,023 --> 00:45:29,269
Welcome home, Mommy!

519
00:45:30,455 --> 00:45:31,952
Hello, sweetie.

520
00:45:34,246 --> 00:45:37,069
Mom, come here. Look! look!

521
00:45:37,124 --> 00:45:38,776
I made you some Hibial.

522
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:45,507
Why'd you give me more to do?

523
00:45:45,532 --> 00:45:45,920
Hm?

524
00:45:46,795 --> 00:45:48,861
Why did you take all this out?

525
00:45:51,461 --> 00:45:53,181
Because I wanted to show you what I made.

526
00:45:53,181 --> 00:45:55,457
Can't you just listen to me for once, Erial!

527
00:45:55,531 --> 00:45:55,941
Huh?

528
00:45:56,075 --> 00:45:59,062
Always! You're always making problems.

529
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:01,291
If I don't work then we can't eat,

530
00:46:01,418 --> 00:46:03,361
we cannot survive like this.

531
00:46:03,774 --> 00:46:04,548
Mommy...

532
00:46:04,615 --> 00:46:07,059
You make everything so hard.

533
00:46:07,696 --> 00:46:09,036
Why, Erial?

534
00:46:09,615 --> 00:46:12,141
The tickle bugs are coming.

535
00:46:12,534 --> 00:46:15,820
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.

536
00:46:15,887 --> 00:46:18,524
I bought some dinner, come and eat.

537
00:46:22,124 --> 00:46:23,318
Erial, wait!

538
00:46:33,048 --> 00:46:35,932
I... I'm not a mother

539
00:46:36,395 --> 00:46:38,399
I don't have a right to be.

540
00:46:39,019 --> 00:46:40,577
I don't deserve it.

541
00:46:41,117 --> 00:46:44,578
All this time, I've just been pretending.

542
00:46:44,775 --> 00:46:47,286
Mido was always there to catch me.

543
00:46:47,584 --> 00:46:53,700
You must never fall in love, for if
you do, then you shall truly be alone.

544
00:46:55,026 --> 00:46:56,536
Truly alone.

545
00:46:57,913 --> 00:46:59,114
Elder.

546
00:47:12,678 --> 00:47:15,347
"My mommy".

547
00:47:16,723 --> 00:47:18,517
My mommy.

548
00:47:32,236 --> 00:47:33,633
Erial!

549
00:47:38,562 --> 00:47:39,809
Erial!

550
00:47:40,643 --> 00:47:42,283
Erial, where are you?

551
00:47:42,636 --> 00:47:43,809
Erial!

552
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,053
Erial, please!

553
00:47:49,131 --> 00:47:50,588
Mommy!

554
00:47:51,281 --> 00:47:52,643
Erial!

555
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,705
I tricked you.

556
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,619
You thought I shed my skin, right?

557
00:48:09,068 --> 00:48:10,806
You shed your skin.

558
00:48:10,944 --> 00:48:12,487
I made you laugh.

559
00:48:12,649 --> 00:48:14,163
Wha... Oh.

560
00:48:14,188 --> 00:48:15,516
I got you!

561
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:20,640
Silly boy.

562
00:48:21,288 --> 00:48:22,540
Mommy?

563
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:28,252
I wish... I wish that you could stay like this forever.

564
00:48:29,629 --> 00:48:30,525
Nuh-uh.

565
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:36,275
If I don't get bigger, how will I protect you?

566
00:48:41,345 --> 00:48:43,881
I didn't want you to cry.

567
00:48:45,645 --> 00:48:47,277
Then I won't cry again.

568
00:48:47,564 --> 00:48:49,534
After all, I'm a mom.

569
00:48:53,278 --> 00:48:54,731
You promise me?

570
00:48:55,071 --> 00:48:55,977
Uh-huh.

571
00:49:04,831 --> 00:49:07,020
You promise, too. OK, Erial?

572
00:49:07,083 --> 00:49:09,166
Yeah, I promise.

573
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,621
Mom, I'll always protect you.

574
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:30,298
Keep going, slowly now.

575
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:56,754
All right, order up! Maquia!

576
00:49:57,385 --> 00:49:58,565
Coming!

577
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:04,891
And this one's on you, you're
paying me back for the other day.

578
00:50:09,724 --> 00:50:12,894
It takes a lot of experience to get it perfect like this.

579
00:50:16,751 --> 00:50:19,406
And that's why I told you, you had to cut it out.

580
00:50:19,406 --> 00:50:22,033
I kinda thought it was all going to turn out OK.

581
00:50:22,033 --> 00:50:24,433
Welcome, there's a table at the back.

582
00:50:27,706 --> 00:50:30,100
Maquia, three kelbi, yeah?

583
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:30,818
Sure.

584
00:50:30,863 --> 00:50:31,979
I'll take that, sweetie.

585
00:50:32,472 --> 00:50:33,275
Right away.

586
00:50:33,414 --> 00:50:35,142
I'll take another one, too.

587
00:50:37,007 --> 00:50:39,457
Your sister's got quite a butt on her.

588
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,863
I never noticed.

589
00:50:42,846 --> 00:50:45,962
The two of them hardly look alike at all, right?

590
00:50:46,819 --> 00:50:51,454
Yeah, very suspicious how you just came out of nowhere.

591
00:50:51,668 --> 00:50:53,189
Where'd you say you moved from again?

592
00:50:53,867 --> 00:50:54,520
Huh?

593
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:57,569
Maybe you two ain't brother and sister at all,

594
00:50:57,641 --> 00:51:00,614
just two crazy kids who went and eloped together.

595
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:02,154
Sorry for the wait.

596
00:51:02,179 --> 00:51:03,504
Oh, yes!

597
00:51:04,372 --> 00:51:06,661
Let me know if you need anything else.

598
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:09,171
Welcome.

599
00:51:12,563 --> 00:51:13,109
Hmm...

600
00:51:13,134 --> 00:51:15,045
They keep getting new recruits.

601
00:51:15,394 --> 00:51:18,319
How many guards do they actually need on watch?

602
00:51:18,519 --> 00:51:20,927
Iron's the most important resource we got.

603
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:24,155
Mezarte keeps making cannons and we keep getting fed,

604
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,097
wouldn't call it a terrible deal.

605
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:47,582
You don't think it's all a bit suspicious?

606
00:51:47,695 --> 00:51:50,413
It's almost like they're just
waiting for another war to break out.

607
00:51:50,413 --> 00:51:53,398
Do you think that idiot prince can command our military?

608
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:54,877
Not a chance.

609
00:52:00,674 --> 00:52:04,201
It can get a tad raucous in here, sorry it's so loud.

610
00:52:04,758 --> 00:52:07,008
Here's what we're serving from the kitchen today.

611
00:52:17,242 --> 00:52:18,299
Maquia!

612
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:19,861
Lang, it's you!

613
00:52:21,278 --> 00:52:23,238
I can't believe it's you!

614
00:52:23,304 --> 00:52:25,590
You haven't aged a day, makes sense.

615
00:52:25,615 --> 00:52:27,412
Well, what about you, Lang?

616
00:52:27,506 --> 00:52:30,326
Look how tall you are, like you could touch the sun.

617
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,747
Come on, I'm not a stalk of wheat.

618
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,518
Erial! Hey, Erial!

619
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:41,328
Look up here! It's Lang! Lang is here!

620
00:52:41,675 --> 00:52:43,376
Hey, Erial!

621
00:52:43,896 --> 00:52:44,670
Huh?

622
00:52:53,746 --> 00:52:56,312
Are you sure it's all right for me to be here?

623
00:52:56,312 --> 00:52:59,094
Of course. Sorry about the mess.

624
00:52:59,232 --> 00:53:00,682
Tell me more.

625
00:53:00,989 --> 00:53:02,944
Are Mido and Deol doing well?

626
00:53:03,288 --> 00:53:07,664
Yeah, except cities like Durell
are the only ones with an economy.

627
00:53:07,749 --> 00:53:10,149
All the old rural areas are dying out.

628
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:13,747
Deol left as well. Ah, thank you.

629
00:53:13,747 --> 00:53:15,622
Deol's looking for work too?

630
00:53:15,848 --> 00:53:17,837
Well, can't live without it.

631
00:53:18,126 --> 00:53:20,587
OK, I'm gonna take off.

632
00:53:21,588 --> 00:53:24,653
Ha-ha, what's that? Got yourself a date tonight?

633
00:53:24,786 --> 00:53:27,341
Sure, deep in the mines.

634
00:53:27,834 --> 00:53:30,180
Be safe, OK? I'll see you later.

635
00:53:30,356 --> 00:53:32,735
I'll make some dinner when you get back.

636
00:53:41,983 --> 00:53:44,352
He got a job when we first arrived here,

637
00:53:45,303 --> 00:53:47,238
and he works incredibly hard.

638
00:53:47,238 --> 00:53:48,331
Of course.

639
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:51,367
And we can't just keep selling the Hibial.

640
00:53:51,532 --> 00:53:56,539
Plus, because of me, it's hard
to stay in one place for too long.

641
00:53:58,832 --> 00:54:01,109
I see. Makes sense.

642
00:54:01,182 --> 00:54:04,472
So he finally realized you weren't bound by blood.

643
00:54:04,706 --> 00:54:05,792
How'd he take it?

644
00:54:09,803 --> 00:54:11,210
Five years ago,

645
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:14,778
he told me he didn't want me sleeping next to him anymore.

646
00:54:15,178 --> 00:54:18,575
Not too long after, he stopped calling me "Mom", too.

647
00:54:18,975 --> 00:54:24,067
"Hey"” or "Come here", that's it. That's all he says.

648
00:54:24,067 --> 00:54:27,217
I did the same thing. It's just a phase.

649
00:54:27,552 --> 00:54:32,784
Lang, have you heard anything about Leilia?

650
00:54:42,794 --> 00:54:44,671
Another lost to the red eye.

651
00:54:46,714 --> 00:54:50,033
Burn it to the bones. Bury it deep.

652
00:54:53,689 --> 00:54:54,523
Scary.

653
00:54:54,548 --> 00:54:57,033
There's nothing to fear, Princess Medomel.

654
00:54:57,058 --> 00:54:58,726
Um, where's my father?

655
00:54:58,834 --> 00:55:01,473
His Highness Prince Hazel is currently occupied.

656
00:55:03,786 --> 00:55:05,683
And Mother?

657
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:08,111
What about your mother?

658
00:55:10,217 --> 00:55:12,066
Sorry, it's nothing.

659
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,247
Hair the color of a dawning moon,

660
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:17,120
golden rings within the cornea,

661
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:21,025
and, allegedly, a low body temperature
are the signs of the lorph people.

662
00:55:21,077 --> 00:55:24,997
I regret to say, Princess Medomel shows
almost none of these traits, Your Majesty.

663
00:55:25,022 --> 00:55:31,968
So, if she won't live a long life or bear a
son, then why have I kept that monster in my home?

664
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:36,891
Hmm. I feel it will be difficult
for Leilia to produce another child.

665
00:55:36,985 --> 00:55:40,602
Not to mention, Prince Hazel seems
to have grown tired of her as well.

666
00:55:41,082 --> 00:55:44,034
Oh, my poor, beloved Hazel.

667
00:55:44,214 --> 00:55:48,435
Do something! At least go find my son another woman.

668
00:55:48,495 --> 00:55:51,988
My liege, we are currently seeking survivors of the lorph.

669
00:55:52,145 --> 00:55:54,653
No doubt they will produce a better heir.

670
00:55:55,313 --> 00:55:56,653
Enough!

671
00:55:56,678 --> 00:55:58,001
Princess Leila!

672
00:55:58,235 --> 00:56:00,788
If he has no desire to speak to me

673
00:56:00,788 --> 00:56:03,804
until I'm weighed down with all this filth,

674
00:56:03,875 --> 00:56:06,294
then just be rid of me!

675
00:56:11,011 --> 00:56:12,175
Her Highness is...

676
00:56:12,257 --> 00:56:14,306
I will speak with her alone.

677
00:56:20,283 --> 00:56:22,204
Another Renato has died?

678
00:56:22,288 --> 00:56:23,143
Yes.

679
00:56:23,916 --> 00:56:26,981
I have been locked in this tower

680
00:56:27,128 --> 00:56:30,156
since the day I gave birth to Medomel.

681
00:56:31,056 --> 00:56:34,095
And I am never allowed to see either of them.

682
00:56:35,605 --> 00:56:36,616
The same...

683
00:56:37,329 --> 00:56:39,587
the Renato and I are the same.

684
00:56:40,055 --> 00:56:44,749
We're vapors, things only meant
to exist and live in memory.

685
00:56:46,459 --> 00:56:48,795
The clan that flew the skies,

686
00:56:48,862 --> 00:56:51,172
flowers that sung at day break,

687
00:56:51,254 --> 00:56:53,374
they were not meant for this world.

688
00:56:54,589 --> 00:56:56,886
There must be a way to resist.

689
00:56:57,021 --> 00:56:59,701
A way for the legends to survive the night.

690
00:57:02,141 --> 00:57:03,393
To survive?

691
00:57:04,861 --> 00:57:07,574
You dare say those words?

692
00:57:07,689 --> 00:57:09,953
You murdered them.

693
00:57:27,457 --> 00:57:29,961
My lady, I beg for your forgiveness.

694
00:57:29,961 --> 00:57:31,421
You can burn!

695
00:57:32,251 --> 00:57:34,844
Let me see my daughter!

696
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:37,890
Why can't I see her?

697
00:57:38,016 --> 00:57:40,179
I brought her into this world.

698
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:42,128
I...

699
00:57:42,598 --> 00:57:45,296
I've almost forgotten her scent.

700
00:57:46,127 --> 00:57:49,302
How soft she was when I held her.

701
00:57:50,023 --> 00:57:55,656
Izol, how much must you take
from me before you are satisfied?

702
00:57:55,915 --> 00:58:00,883
You take everything and I am alone.

703
00:58:02,702 --> 00:58:07,163
If you won't let me see Medomel, then bring me Maquia.

704
00:58:09,243 --> 00:58:13,087
Please, bring me Maquia.

705
00:58:13,757 --> 00:58:14,543
I...

706
00:58:15,105 --> 00:58:18,905
I don't want to be alone anymore.

707
00:58:30,355 --> 00:58:32,482
You never cleaned like this before.

708
00:58:32,644 --> 00:58:35,084
It's been you and me for so long,

709
00:58:35,193 --> 00:58:37,968
we've never had any company over before.

710
00:58:42,408 --> 00:58:44,219
Hey, help me?

711
00:58:54,212 --> 00:58:56,073
You've gotten so tall.

712
00:58:56,173 --> 00:58:57,755
I guess so.

713
00:59:03,031 --> 00:59:05,223
Maquia, I need to talk to you.

714
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,934
Will you have time when your shift is over?

715
00:59:08,771 --> 00:59:09,769
Yeah, I think so.

716
00:59:09,769 --> 00:59:11,722
I'll be around once you finish then.

717
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:14,454
Maquia, got an order coming up.

718
00:59:14,508 --> 00:59:15,474
OK.

719
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:24,373
Man, I thought she was your girl, so I never made a move.

720
00:59:24,409 --> 00:59:25,720
Same here.

721
00:59:26,242 --> 00:59:28,890
Come on, lads, there's plenty of fish in the sea.

722
00:59:29,923 --> 00:59:32,542
But why does that jerk get this fish?

723
00:59:32,822 --> 00:59:34,570
She's not like that.

724
00:59:34,914 --> 00:59:36,334
Oh... Yeah?

725
00:59:36,629 --> 00:59:39,899
Hey, when life's got you down, you gotta drink up.

726
00:59:40,386 --> 00:59:41,550
I'm not...

727
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:43,670
What you're not is a kid anymore.

728
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:50,643
He kept it down! Nice.

729
00:59:50,681 --> 00:59:52,451
Now you gotta try the real stuff.

730
00:59:52,938 --> 00:59:55,953
Down this and you're a real man, Erial.

731
00:59:56,466 --> 01:00:00,454
Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink it down, drink it down,

732
01:00:00,554 --> 01:00:04,354
burn and pound, burn and pound,
bottoms up and pound it down.

733
01:00:04,379 --> 01:00:09,787
Erial, Erial, Erial, Erial!

734
01:00:09,787 --> 01:00:11,372
The trick is keeping it down.

735
01:00:11,372 --> 01:00:13,976
Fill it to the brim, lads! One more!

736
01:00:14,083 --> 01:00:15,903
We'll make you a man yet.

737
01:00:20,046 --> 01:00:21,919
You're sure they're looking for me?

738
01:00:24,343 --> 01:00:26,544
We're gonna have to leave the city again.

739
01:00:27,555 --> 01:00:30,126
Wanna come back to the farm with me?

740
01:00:31,047 --> 01:00:31,874
But Lang...

741
01:00:31,899 --> 01:00:33,060
It'll be perfect!

742
01:00:33,346 --> 01:00:35,126
The price of goat milk has gone up.

743
01:00:35,579 --> 01:00:36,925
You can bring Erial.

744
01:00:37,589 --> 01:00:39,503
We'd just bring you trouble.

745
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:40,444
Maquia.

746
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:46,691
Lang, if something were to happen to
your mom or your brother, I just couldn't.

747
01:00:47,404 --> 01:00:51,471
Maquia, I want you to be trouble.

748
01:00:51,496 --> 01:00:52,463
Huh?

749
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:57,168
Ever since I was little, I
would do anything for you, Maquia.

750
01:00:59,121 --> 01:01:00,681
Just think about it.

751
01:01:01,964 --> 01:01:04,515
A future and...

752
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:07,977
being with me.

753
01:01:24,924 --> 01:01:27,757
I can't do that. I'm so sorry.

754
01:01:27,895 --> 01:01:28,936
Huh?

755
01:01:29,492 --> 01:01:32,995
I spend every moment thinking about my Erial.

756
01:01:35,081 --> 01:01:38,149
Thinking "How can we stay together?",

757
01:01:39,129 --> 01:01:42,269
"How can I become a true mother to him?"

758
01:01:43,501 --> 01:01:47,453
I've never been able to find answers to those questions.

759
01:01:48,956 --> 01:01:53,172
And I don't see myself finding the answers anytime soon.

760
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:58,813
I've never had that kind of wisdom

761
01:01:59,379 --> 01:02:01,285
but that's all I want,

762
01:02:01,838 --> 01:02:05,438
forever, to think about my son.

763
01:02:11,658 --> 01:02:13,052
I understand.

764
01:02:13,626 --> 01:02:16,956
Listen, let me at least help you find a new home,

765
01:02:17,107 --> 01:02:19,657
some place you and Erial can be safe.

766
01:02:19,709 --> 01:02:21,590
You don't have to do this alone.

767
01:02:50,221 --> 01:02:51,001
Huh?!

768
01:02:53,371 --> 01:02:54,518
Erial?

769
01:02:58,914 --> 01:03:00,101
Are you all right?

770
01:03:01,792 --> 01:03:03,364
You smell like...

771
01:03:03,868 --> 01:03:05,087
I'm home.

772
01:03:05,112 --> 01:03:06,672
But you never drink!

773
01:03:06,714 --> 01:03:07,734
Are you all right?

774
01:03:07,759 --> 01:03:09,569
No welcome home kiss?

775
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:11,906
You always used to...

776
01:03:12,178 --> 01:03:15,014
You used to always kiss me hello.

777
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:21,020
Erial, are you all right? Can you stand?

778
01:03:22,178 --> 01:03:23,338
They thought...

779
01:03:24,265 --> 01:03:27,335
everyone thought we had eloped together.

780
01:03:27,435 --> 01:03:28,095
Huh?

781
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:31,371
And he thought Lang was gonna take you away.

782
01:03:32,811 --> 01:03:34,260
What are you saying?

783
01:03:34,413 --> 01:03:36,239
Erial, come on.

784
01:03:36,378 --> 01:03:38,167
I'm gonna get you to bed and you can...

785
01:03:48,335 --> 01:03:49,668
Be careful.

786
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:58,317
Don't step on that!

787
01:04:05,189 --> 01:04:05,970
You...

788
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:10,003
you wove this Hibial for me.

789
01:04:15,923 --> 01:04:17,050
I hate this.

790
01:04:19,094 --> 01:04:21,722
Why do you still keep this thing around?

791
01:04:21,981 --> 01:04:24,758
How long are you gonna treat me like a kid?!

792
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,560
You are always going to be my child.

793
01:04:58,541 --> 01:05:00,814
That's something that will never change.

794
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:05,730
Erial!

795
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:16,205
I spoke to Lang and we have to find a new home.

796
01:05:17,665 --> 01:05:20,310
Is there somewhere you want to go next?

797
01:05:20,477 --> 01:05:24,722
I'm happy to go anywhere, as long as I'm with you.

798
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:27,071
Right.

799
01:05:28,497 --> 01:05:30,666
I don't think I can be your son anymore.

800
01:05:55,782 --> 01:05:57,315
I have a favor to ask.

801
01:05:57,828 --> 01:06:00,607
Would you consider hiring me as a castle solider?

802
01:06:04,032 --> 01:06:05,325
I need this, Lang.

803
01:06:06,477 --> 01:06:08,243
Your mother's going to be sad.

804
01:06:08,792 --> 01:06:10,907
She's not my mother.

805
01:06:11,732 --> 01:06:12,953
Did you say that?

806
01:06:13,315 --> 01:06:14,288
Huh?

807
01:06:15,319 --> 01:06:17,320
Did you say that to her?

808
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:19,366
I may have.

809
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:22,545
How dare you?!

810
01:06:22,785 --> 01:06:28,433
Maquia raised you since you were
nothing but an infant! Stop being a brat!

811
01:06:28,606 --> 01:06:32,796
She worked every day, she was
no older than you are right now.

812
01:06:33,182 --> 01:06:34,630
How could you?

813
01:06:34,655 --> 01:06:36,666
You think I don't know that?!

814
01:06:38,087 --> 01:06:42,009
Why does she care about me? Why did she stay with me?

815
01:06:46,642 --> 01:06:47,551
Erial...

816
01:06:47,877 --> 01:06:49,684
She's always with me.

817
01:06:51,092 --> 01:06:52,945
She worked so hard for me.

818
01:06:54,425 --> 01:06:57,027
I always thought that's what a mother does,

819
01:06:57,027 --> 01:07:00,950
that's... that's why I called her my mother.

820
01:07:04,457 --> 01:07:06,157
I wanna protect her.

821
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:12,986
But I can't, not like this.

822
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:14,910
I'm just...

823
01:07:17,047 --> 01:07:18,638
I'm hurting her.

824
01:07:19,655 --> 01:07:21,842
I need to protect her.

825
01:07:23,721 --> 01:07:26,545
I'm just not strong enough.

826
01:07:39,642 --> 01:07:44,330
If you cry like that, you're no
different from when you were a baby.

827
01:07:48,887 --> 01:07:50,733
Are you sure you wanna do this?

828
01:08:10,695 --> 01:08:12,896
It's OK, I can do it.

829
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:15,121
You were gonna leave too, right?

830
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:18,207
Right after I see you off to the castle.

831
01:08:29,999 --> 01:08:32,918
I'll miss you. Be safe.

832
01:08:34,946 --> 01:08:36,210
I'll see you soon.

833
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:42,702
I'll see you soon.

834
01:09:19,294 --> 01:09:20,930
Stop crying.

835
01:09:22,172 --> 01:09:23,843
Moms don't cry.

836
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,873
He promised me.

837
01:09:28,554 --> 01:09:30,934
Erial, you promised.

838
01:09:31,872 --> 01:09:33,871
You said you would protect me.

839
01:09:37,312 --> 01:09:38,427
You said...

840
01:09:40,983 --> 01:09:42,521
Please don't go.

841
01:09:44,153 --> 01:09:45,954
Please don't go.

842
01:10:56,035 --> 01:10:59,839
Aww, I thought we'd get to see a real Renato.

843
01:11:00,039 --> 01:11:03,553
Sorry, sweetheart, there used
to be a whole flight of Renato,

844
01:11:03,664 --> 01:11:06,360
but now there's only one still alive at the castle.

845
01:11:06,427 --> 01:11:07,518
That's sad.

846
01:11:07,543 --> 01:11:13,315
I really hope they don't expect that us marching behind
this ridiculous Renato doll will actually raise morale.

847
01:11:13,367 --> 01:11:15,498
Hey, did you guys hear about Biaira?

848
01:11:15,538 --> 01:11:17,355
They got themselves an lorph too.

849
01:11:18,082 --> 01:11:20,815
Wait seriously? Like, for real?

850
01:11:23,377 --> 01:11:27,188
Come on, Commander, what did the lice do to deserve that?

851
01:11:27,339 --> 01:11:28,535
Shut it.

852
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:30,314
Division Commander Lang?

853
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:31,634
Hmm?

854
01:11:34,096 --> 01:11:35,830
Yup, I heard it too.

855
01:11:36,192 --> 01:11:39,845
Supposedly, it's a girl about
the same age as Princess Leilia.

856
01:11:42,521 --> 01:11:44,657
That doesn't mean it's Maquia.

857
01:11:45,224 --> 01:11:46,310
You worried?

858
01:11:47,067 --> 01:11:49,507
No, she's strong.

859
01:11:51,683 --> 01:11:54,609
Maquia would be so happy to hear that from you.

860
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:57,977
She was always so afraid she wasn't strong,

861
01:11:58,411 --> 01:12:00,194
that she couldn't protect you.

862
01:12:00,927 --> 01:12:03,960
She worked so hard to be a mother to you.

863
01:12:04,652 --> 01:12:06,946
To be a mother you could always depend on.

864
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:11,424
She's still a child.

865
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:17,494
Yeah, maybe she is a child.

866
01:12:17,911 --> 01:12:19,057
So this time...

867
01:12:19,482 --> 01:12:22,388
this time I'll be a father to her.

868
01:12:24,646 --> 01:12:25,604
Huh?

869
01:12:30,416 --> 01:12:33,315
Mezarte has become nothing.

870
01:12:33,842 --> 01:12:36,899
They defiled the ancient power they held.

871
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:40,367
Turning myths to nothing but tools for politics.

872
01:12:40,654 --> 01:12:44,570
The nation of Biaira shall commit all we can to your aid.

873
01:13:04,144 --> 01:13:07,639
Maquia, the time has come.

874
01:13:09,733 --> 01:13:11,515
Your hair's gotten so long.

875
01:13:11,899 --> 01:13:15,995
Back in the village, we were only permitted
hair past our waist if we had a child.

876
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:22,206
Come, Maquia, we're going to rescue Leilia.

877
01:13:29,586 --> 01:13:31,263
Will there be war?

878
01:13:31,643 --> 01:13:35,722
Only a moment of suffering for people like us.

879
01:13:36,342 --> 01:13:39,372
Nothing to the pain you must have known these years.

880
01:13:39,678 --> 01:13:43,257
Abandoning the lorph, wandering the world with nothing.

881
01:13:43,977 --> 01:13:47,714
Lost and alone, as if you'd died alive.

882
01:13:47,947 --> 01:13:52,344
So... you know how we feel, don't you?

883
01:13:52,997 --> 01:13:54,845
The Clan of the Separated,

884
01:13:55,028 --> 01:13:58,060
the elder must be long gone and passed into shadow.

885
01:13:59,166 --> 01:14:02,443
Everything we have ever known has faded away.

886
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:07,664
And you, you left it all behind for your own world.

887
01:14:08,445 --> 01:14:12,815
The lorph work as one, the lorph weave one cloth.

888
01:14:12,963 --> 01:14:14,768
You and me and Leilia,

889
01:14:14,922 --> 01:14:17,570
we cannot weave different histories.

890
01:14:28,123 --> 01:14:31,039
Congratulations, Maquia, you're home,

891
01:14:31,107 --> 01:14:33,429
we have severed the final thread.

892
01:14:33,642 --> 01:14:38,317
We begin anew, weaving one future.

893
01:14:59,101 --> 01:14:59,828
Dita!

894
01:15:00,048 --> 01:15:00,488
Huh?

895
01:15:01,343 --> 01:15:03,236
Erial, welcome home!

896
01:15:08,598 --> 01:15:10,811
You're home pretty early today.

897
01:15:11,063 --> 01:15:13,959
I'm sorry I'm so busy right when you need me the most.

898
01:15:14,726 --> 01:15:17,716
Don't you worry, we still have plenty of time.

899
01:15:17,756 --> 01:15:20,637
I know, but I still worry anyway.

900
01:15:21,057 --> 01:15:22,807
I'll get dinner started.

901
01:15:22,832 --> 01:15:26,118
No, no. I got it, you should be resting.

902
01:15:26,744 --> 01:15:29,039
It's better if I move around a bit.

903
01:15:30,749 --> 01:15:33,216
I'm fine. Sit down, sit down.

904
01:15:33,543 --> 01:15:34,842
OK.

905
01:15:38,006 --> 01:15:40,705
Do you think it's odd how we came together?

906
01:15:40,945 --> 01:15:42,384
Sometimes.

907
01:15:42,444 --> 01:15:45,739
I was looking for work. Came here to Mezarte.

908
01:15:46,176 --> 01:15:49,171
Who could have imagined I'd meet you again?

909
01:15:50,164 --> 01:15:51,364
And now...

910
01:15:53,335 --> 01:15:58,280
Hey, Erial, was I truly the right one for you?

911
01:16:00,936 --> 01:16:03,113
Hmm? What did you say?

912
01:16:29,403 --> 01:16:30,590
Is it Biaira?

913
01:16:31,265 --> 01:16:35,366
Not just Biaira, Hugh and Endora ships are with them.

914
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,481
Erial, wait!

915
01:16:44,015 --> 01:16:47,309
Keep our child safe, I'll be back, I promise.

916
01:17:04,848 --> 01:17:06,266
It's about damn time.

917
01:17:06,291 --> 01:17:07,406
Sorry, sir.

918
01:17:13,921 --> 01:17:17,772
Biairan soldiers have crossed the
mountains in an attempt to close off escape.

919
01:17:17,822 --> 01:17:19,469
Split into two...

920
01:17:19,983 --> 01:17:20,784
Was that...

921
01:17:21,088 --> 01:17:21,996
Cannon fire?

922
01:17:24,446 --> 01:17:25,864
How ironic.

923
01:17:33,930 --> 01:17:38,867
Mezarte exploited ancient powers
as a show of unstoppable might

924
01:17:39,334 --> 01:17:44,925
and now the nations that surround us have
forged alliances and furled condemnations,

925
01:17:45,082 --> 01:17:49,035
all to tear down Mezarte's abuse of those ancient powers.

926
01:17:58,605 --> 01:18:00,345
Where is my High Minister?

927
01:18:00,532 --> 01:18:01,983
He's already fled the castle,

928
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:04,137
along with many of your retainers, Your Majesty.

929
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:07,155
Has he abandoned me in my time of need?

930
01:18:07,241 --> 01:18:10,047
What must I endure?

931
01:18:10,113 --> 01:18:13,561
It's all over, the kingdom falls.

932
01:18:13,967 --> 01:18:15,892
Majesty, you have to move.

933
01:18:16,039 --> 01:18:19,125
Go. I'll return and find Princess Medomel.

934
01:18:19,253 --> 01:18:22,152
Silence, you fool, I have no daughter.

935
01:18:22,265 --> 01:18:24,032
We don't need that monster!

936
01:19:14,519 --> 01:19:16,436
Maquia, come on!

937
01:19:51,975 --> 01:19:53,181
Erial!

938
01:19:55,187 --> 01:19:55,973
Erial!

939
01:20:14,284 --> 01:20:15,423
My Leilia.

940
01:20:16,363 --> 01:20:18,430
I found you.

941
01:20:21,117 --> 01:20:22,190
Krim?

942
01:20:23,472 --> 01:20:25,145
How are you?

943
01:20:26,461 --> 01:20:27,893
You're alive?

944
01:20:28,279 --> 01:20:30,781
No, it's not real.

945
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:35,599
You're a ghost.

946
01:20:40,892 --> 01:20:42,611
I came to save you.

947
01:20:43,551 --> 01:20:44,992
I swear to you,

948
01:20:45,512 --> 01:20:47,803
I am going to make them suffer,

949
01:20:48,024 --> 01:20:50,504
I'm going to make them pay for hurting you.

950
01:20:51,157 --> 01:20:54,114
Then I'll wipe it all clean, everything.

951
01:20:54,114 --> 01:20:54,660
Wait.

952
01:20:58,743 --> 01:21:00,927
I want to see her first.

953
01:21:01,079 --> 01:21:03,707
My daughter, please.

954
01:21:03,707 --> 01:21:04,960
What are you saying?

955
01:21:05,386 --> 01:21:07,585
They forced you to bear them a child.

956
01:21:07,585 --> 01:21:09,064
You didn't want her, Leilia.

957
01:21:09,089 --> 01:21:11,610
She, she is still my daughter.

958
01:21:11,635 --> 01:21:12,835
Forget about her!

959
01:21:12,905 --> 01:21:16,813
The name of that child forced upon you
will never be entwined in your Hibial.

960
01:21:16,838 --> 01:21:18,198
That's not true.

961
01:21:19,431 --> 01:21:20,566
I thought you were...

962
01:21:21,019 --> 01:21:23,419
I thought everyone who cared for me...

963
01:21:25,019 --> 01:21:26,245
you were dead.

964
01:21:32,747 --> 01:21:33,785
Everything...

965
01:21:34,304 --> 01:21:36,215
I thought I had lost everything.

966
01:21:36,823 --> 01:21:39,314
She was the only thing that mattered.

967
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:42,017
My beautiful daughter.

968
01:21:42,577 --> 01:21:45,876
All I could think of was holding her...

969
01:21:46,596 --> 01:21:49,013
pressing her close to my chest and...

970
01:21:49,961 --> 01:21:52,415
those thoughts were what kept me alive.

971
01:21:52,578 --> 01:21:54,412
I had nothing else.

972
01:21:56,843 --> 01:21:58,000
Leilia.

973
01:22:00,099 --> 01:22:01,132
My angel...

974
01:22:01,925 --> 01:22:03,032
Medomel.

975
01:22:18,072 --> 01:22:20,407
I understand, I do.

976
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:23,335
Let's greet the dark.

977
01:22:23,641 --> 01:22:25,329
Let's end it together.

978
01:22:29,013 --> 01:22:30,320
Krim!

979
01:22:35,882 --> 01:22:37,424
I will not...

980
01:22:41,811 --> 01:22:43,142
...allow anyone...

981
01:22:45,872 --> 01:22:47,820
...to harm our Hibial

982
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,507
ever again.

983
01:22:58,366 --> 01:22:59,172
Krim?

984
01:23:02,832 --> 01:23:04,408
Princess Leilia!

985
01:23:36,875 --> 01:23:38,281
It never stops.

986
01:23:39,070 --> 01:23:41,729
Leilia and Maquia.

987
01:23:42,282 --> 01:23:43,302
But why?

988
01:23:44,397 --> 01:23:48,092
Why does time always...

989
01:24:27,235 --> 01:24:30,635
The same fires as that day.

990
01:24:42,393 --> 01:24:43,093
Huh?

991
01:24:56,397 --> 01:24:57,349
Erial.

992
01:24:58,562 --> 01:24:59,815
Commander Lang.

993
01:25:00,894 --> 01:25:02,267
Word came down,

994
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:05,687
there were two lorph aboard one of the Biairan ships.

995
01:25:07,737 --> 01:25:09,616
You came upon them, didn't you?

996
01:25:11,996 --> 01:25:12,924
Yes.

997
01:25:14,082 --> 01:25:16,042
Just go, leave this to us.

998
01:25:16,145 --> 01:25:16,872
Find Maquia...

999
01:25:16,897 --> 01:25:18,325
I'm willing to fight, Commander!

1000
01:25:19,723 --> 01:25:23,010
You didn't join up out of loyalty to Mezarte, Erial.

1001
01:25:23,216 --> 01:25:25,343
You signed on just so you could get away from your mother.

1002
01:25:25,343 --> 01:25:26,376
That's not true!

1003
01:25:28,459 --> 01:25:30,719
Maybe that's why I joined up at first,

1004
01:25:31,565 --> 01:25:35,528
but now... now I have Dita and my friends.

1005
01:25:36,075 --> 01:25:37,922
I have a baby on the way.

1006
01:25:38,901 --> 01:25:42,108
Mezarte is the first home that I made,

1007
01:25:42,175 --> 01:25:44,401
the first home that was mine without my mother.

1008
01:25:44,461 --> 01:25:46,233
I want to protect that.

1009
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:48,524
Hmm.

1010
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:08,283
Are you all right?

1011
01:26:14,039 --> 01:26:15,005
It's you.

1012
01:26:15,129 --> 01:26:16,144
I'll get help.

1013
01:26:16,456 --> 01:26:18,122
Wait, no!

1014
01:26:20,341 --> 01:26:21,269
But I...

1015
01:26:23,571 --> 01:26:25,171
It's Erial's.

1016
01:26:25,403 --> 01:26:27,057
It's his child.

1017
01:26:33,390 --> 01:26:35,050
Fire!

1018
01:26:54,807 --> 01:26:56,267
Fire!

1019
01:27:00,119 --> 01:27:01,120
Dita...

1020
01:27:02,358 --> 01:27:05,606
stay strong, almost there.

1021
01:27:05,631 --> 01:27:07,394
Soon you'll hold your baby.

1022
01:27:28,024 --> 01:27:29,339
Keep pushing, Dita!

1023
01:27:29,383 --> 01:27:30,752
Keep pushing.

1024
01:27:31,119 --> 01:27:33,794
That's right, Dita. Almost there.

1025
01:27:34,657 --> 01:27:36,204
Just a little further.

1026
01:27:37,624 --> 01:27:38,559
Dita!

1027
01:27:58,663 --> 01:27:59,395
Hold on!

1028
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:00,248
It hurts!

1029
01:28:00,370 --> 01:28:01,270
Dita!

1030
01:28:01,295 --> 01:28:02,208
Please, make it end!

1031
01:28:03,116 --> 01:28:04,123
Dita, it'll be OK...

1032
01:28:04,148 --> 01:28:05,423
You have to save the baby.

1033
01:28:05,448 --> 01:28:08,589
Please, Maquia, please!

1034
01:28:08,674 --> 01:28:09,967
I will, Dita.

1035
01:28:11,050 --> 01:28:12,322
I swear it.

1036
01:28:14,881 --> 01:28:17,807
Someone is coming! Get out!

1037
01:28:32,473 --> 01:28:34,387
Your baby's coming.

1038
01:28:34,987 --> 01:28:36,792
You're so strong, Dita.

1039
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:40,965
You and my Erial,

1040
01:28:41,081 --> 01:28:42,971
you're going to be parents soon.

1041
01:29:14,839 --> 01:29:19,343
You were wonderful, really... Mommy.

1042
01:29:37,201 --> 01:29:39,071
You're really going to take him with you?

1043
01:29:39,396 --> 01:29:40,569
He's not a toy.

1044
01:29:40,675 --> 01:29:42,088
I know he's not a toy.

1045
01:29:42,675 --> 01:29:44,061
He's my...

1046
01:29:44,694 --> 01:29:46,538
He's my Hibial.

1047
01:29:49,019 --> 01:29:50,526
Beautiful.

1048
01:29:51,984 --> 01:29:53,732
I see now.

1049
01:30:04,288 --> 01:30:07,354
Erial, it's time to come inside.

1050
01:30:07,458 --> 01:30:10,425
Mommy, I'm home.

1051
01:30:14,926 --> 01:30:17,345
Look at you, you're covered in snow.

1052
01:30:19,987 --> 01:30:22,350
Welcome home, my Erial.

1053
01:30:29,855 --> 01:30:31,406
Welcome home...

1054
01:30:33,242 --> 01:30:34,701
my Erial.

1055
01:30:38,608 --> 01:30:40,094
A dream.

1056
01:30:40,533 --> 01:30:42,868
No... I'm here.

1057
01:30:42,893 --> 01:30:45,332
But, Mom, the snow.

1058
01:30:45,864 --> 01:30:48,826
It's not snow, it's ash.

1059
01:31:00,136 --> 01:31:03,471
Dita gave birth during the invasion.

1060
01:31:06,604 --> 01:31:08,337
You'll hurt yourself.

1061
01:31:08,420 --> 01:31:11,054
It's OK, they're waiting for you.

1062
01:31:11,355 --> 01:31:14,517
And they'll keep waiting, you're a father now.

1063
01:31:16,423 --> 01:31:18,544
When your mother gave birth to you,

1064
01:31:19,334 --> 01:31:21,844
she must've gone through the same thing.

1065
01:31:27,077 --> 01:31:29,594
I remember her holding you,

1066
01:31:29,749 --> 01:31:31,465
holding you so tight

1067
01:31:32,116 --> 01:31:34,116
and you were so very small.

1068
01:31:35,546 --> 01:31:37,686
Her arms wrapped around you

1069
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:39,872
as she protected you.

1070
01:31:40,169 --> 01:31:42,105
I could barely get you out,

1071
01:31:42,249 --> 01:31:45,103
I had to pull away one finger at a time.

1072
01:31:45,197 --> 01:31:46,230
That's enough.

1073
01:31:46,255 --> 01:31:47,116
I...

1074
01:31:47,808 --> 01:31:51,062
I wasn't able to be a mother to you, I'm sorry...

1075
01:31:51,062 --> 01:31:51,960
That's enough!

1076
01:31:54,769 --> 01:31:56,771
You've taught me everything, Mom.

1077
01:31:57,151 --> 01:31:58,424
To be kind

1078
01:31:58,861 --> 01:31:59,944
and strong

1079
01:32:00,613 --> 01:32:02,185
and brave.

1080
01:32:03,159 --> 01:32:06,082
You taught me what it means to love someone.

1081
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:13,640
I tried to do all I could for you,

1082
01:32:13,892 --> 01:32:17,059
but you were the one who ended up caring for me.

1083
01:32:18,982 --> 01:32:21,568
When I first laid eyes on you that night,

1084
01:32:21,926 --> 01:32:23,995
I thought you would cry with me,

1085
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:25,374
share my sorrow.

1086
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:29,262
I thought that you would be my Hibial,

1087
01:32:30,148 --> 01:32:34,104
but then, every moment I spent with you,

1088
01:32:34,858 --> 01:32:38,503
all the sadness, all the pain,

1089
01:32:39,576 --> 01:32:41,153
it all went away.

1090
01:32:42,122 --> 01:32:43,477
Still, I...

1091
01:32:43,781 --> 01:32:46,617
I left, I failed you.

1092
01:32:47,827 --> 01:32:50,782
You could never, ever fail me, Erial.

1093
01:32:51,435 --> 01:32:55,065
Despite what you think, you did keep your promise to me.

1094
01:32:55,869 --> 01:32:57,409
You've been here,

1095
01:32:57,802 --> 01:33:00,668
protecting me this entire time.

1096
01:33:01,298 --> 01:33:04,773
Even alone, even if we were separated,

1097
01:33:04,887 --> 01:33:07,819
whenever I didn't know what to do with myself,

1098
01:33:08,563 --> 01:33:11,684
you were there, I would always think of you...

1099
01:33:12,768 --> 01:33:14,744
and everything was OK.

1100
01:33:16,011 --> 01:33:17,883
So if you call my name,

1101
01:33:18,315 --> 01:33:20,337
even if it isn't "Mom"...

1102
01:33:22,039 --> 01:33:24,059
whatever name you choose,

1103
01:33:24,294 --> 01:33:26,223
I swear to you, Erial,

1104
01:33:26,369 --> 01:33:28,369
that name will become mine.

1105
01:33:29,827 --> 01:33:32,329
You wove me together, Erial...

1106
01:33:33,132 --> 01:33:34,574
all that I am.

1107
01:33:45,342 --> 01:33:46,343
Maquia!

1108
01:33:50,514 --> 01:33:51,575
Lang!

1109
01:33:52,268 --> 01:33:54,712
Please, I need you to take Erial with you.

1110
01:33:56,103 --> 01:33:58,566
His wife and child are waiting for him.

1111
01:33:59,426 --> 01:34:02,114
It's time for him to go back home.

1112
01:34:13,621 --> 01:34:14,610
Don't go.

1113
01:34:21,879 --> 01:34:24,339
Please, don't go.

1114
01:34:24,497 --> 01:34:26,123
Please, Mom!

1115
01:35:33,075 --> 01:35:35,849
It's almost time to head down, Princess Medomel.

1116
01:35:36,435 --> 01:35:38,357
My father and the others?

1117
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:44,833
Well, don't worry, it's quite all right.

1118
01:35:46,505 --> 01:35:48,025
When I reach the city,

1119
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:51,297
it will be a completely new life that awaits me.

1120
01:35:52,261 --> 01:35:55,431
But, even so I...

1121
01:35:55,954 --> 01:35:56,907
Huh?

1122
01:36:11,879 --> 01:36:13,568
Who are you?

1123
01:36:16,345 --> 01:36:17,703
Princess Leilia.

1124
01:36:23,248 --> 01:36:24,401
Leilia...

1125
01:36:25,414 --> 01:36:28,209
you're my mother.

1126
01:36:33,677 --> 01:36:36,288
I am Leilia of the lorph.

1127
01:36:36,588 --> 01:36:39,783
I am wild, strong-willed.

1128
01:36:40,017 --> 01:36:41,856
I am reckless.

1129
01:36:43,729 --> 01:36:45,181
I am free.

1130
01:36:45,517 --> 01:36:47,232
I'll always be free.

1131
01:36:50,402 --> 01:36:52,144
Fly, Leilia!

1132
01:37:06,543 --> 01:37:10,017
I can fly, I can fly.

1133
01:37:12,777 --> 01:37:13,717
Mother!

1134
01:37:30,984 --> 01:37:32,090
Maquia?

1135
01:37:35,447 --> 01:37:39,618
Yes, you can fly too.

1136
01:37:46,034 --> 01:37:47,121
Goodbye!

1137
01:37:47,292 --> 01:37:48,876
Forget me, Medomel!

1138
01:37:49,592 --> 01:37:51,572
I promise I will, too.

1139
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:56,609
I won't weave these years, my life in
the castle will never be in my Hibial!

1140
01:37:57,075 --> 01:37:58,208
My mother.

1141
01:37:58,628 --> 01:38:02,517
The long, long memories will fade away.

1142
01:38:03,205 --> 01:38:05,878
I will forget every moment,

1143
01:38:06,103 --> 01:38:09,899
because it will be just a tiny tear.

1144
01:38:14,757 --> 01:38:15,542
A tear.

1145
01:38:15,882 --> 01:38:16,822
Yes.

1146
01:38:16,935 --> 01:38:18,244
That's my mother.

1147
01:38:18,644 --> 01:38:21,094
I've never seen anyone so beautiful.

1148
01:38:24,872 --> 01:38:26,697
I'm sorry, Medomel.

1149
01:38:36,049 --> 01:38:37,482
Princess Leilia.

1150
01:38:38,495 --> 01:38:40,868
We don't need the Renato,

1151
01:38:41,198 --> 01:38:43,583
we don't need the lorph.

1152
01:38:44,109 --> 01:38:47,077
If the legends are so fated to fade away,

1153
01:38:47,671 --> 01:38:53,178
then let them live of their own accord up to the end.

1154
01:38:57,446 --> 01:38:59,652
Leilia, don't cry.

1155
01:39:04,309 --> 01:39:08,439
You're afraid, but I promise you will never forget.

1156
01:39:19,426 --> 01:39:21,260
That was so hard...

1157
01:39:22,930 --> 01:39:25,550
and it hurt so much.

1158
01:39:27,476 --> 01:39:30,240
But how is the world still beautiful?

1159
01:39:31,386 --> 01:39:34,066
I could never forget.

1160
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:06,846
I made it home.

1161
01:40:09,882 --> 01:40:11,019
You're really here.

1162
01:40:11,934 --> 01:40:14,360
I promised I'd be back.

1163
01:40:16,488 --> 01:40:19,115
That's our baby.

1164
01:40:19,140 --> 01:40:19,816
Yeah.

1165
01:40:28,293 --> 01:40:30,695
She's softer than I could have imagined.

1166
01:40:36,504 --> 01:40:38,954
She's perfect. We need to choose a name.

1167
01:40:39,131 --> 01:40:40,374
Mm-hm.

1168
01:40:41,288 --> 01:40:42,174
Dita?

1169
01:40:42,574 --> 01:40:44,229
I'm so sorry.

1170
01:40:45,762 --> 01:40:47,808
When we were little kids,

1171
01:40:48,534 --> 01:40:51,107
you liked your mom and I said...

1172
01:40:51,580 --> 01:40:53,122
I said you were weird.

1173
01:40:53,722 --> 01:40:55,606
I'm so sorry.

1174
01:40:56,408 --> 01:40:58,521
I swear, I didn't mean it.

1175
01:40:59,568 --> 01:41:01,289
Your mom was so...

1176
01:41:01,848 --> 01:41:05,282
so beautiful and so kind.

1177
01:41:06,825 --> 01:41:08,452
She came and...

1178
01:41:12,372 --> 01:41:13,999
She was here and she...

1179
01:41:13,999 --> 01:41:15,386
I love you, Dita.

1180
01:41:16,279 --> 01:41:18,352
I love you too, Erial.

1181
01:41:18,712 --> 01:41:20,385
I was so foolish.

1182
01:41:20,858 --> 01:41:22,929
I used to be so jealous of her.

1183
01:41:23,022 --> 01:41:25,235
I wanted you to love me too.

1184
01:41:27,012 --> 01:41:29,685
My mother raised me to be the man I am,

1185
01:41:29,932 --> 01:41:31,431
just so I could love you.

1186
01:41:32,935 --> 01:41:34,341
And our daughter...

1187
01:41:34,686 --> 01:41:36,174
she'll love someone, too.

1188
01:41:36,630 --> 01:41:39,333
So we'll raise her, you and I,

1189
01:41:39,637 --> 01:41:41,170
we'll raise her well,

1190
01:41:41,379 --> 01:41:42,419
together,

1191
01:41:43,362 --> 01:41:45,793
so one day she'll know how to love,

1192
01:41:45,923 --> 01:41:47,273
just like us.

1193
01:41:53,330 --> 01:41:55,462
The Clan of the Separated.

1194
01:41:56,222 --> 01:41:59,045
You are destined to say many goodbyes,

1195
01:41:59,479 --> 01:42:02,091
to see so much that will change.

1196
01:42:03,032 --> 01:42:06,298
Time will march on, never ending.

1197
01:42:07,177 --> 01:42:11,770
You'll meet someone new, an endless stream of new faces.

1198
01:42:12,443 --> 01:42:15,769
You meet someone and you weave.

1199
01:42:31,785 --> 01:42:33,090
Hello, little one.

1200
01:42:36,245 --> 01:42:38,120
I'm here to see your grandfather.

1201
01:42:38,208 --> 01:42:39,753
Would you take me to him?

1202
01:42:40,472 --> 01:42:41,945
You know Grandpa?

1203
01:42:41,970 --> 01:42:43,149
Lily.

1204
01:42:43,782 --> 01:42:46,566
What are you doing out here?

1205
01:42:48,164 --> 01:42:49,457
Aren't you...?

1206
01:42:53,181 --> 01:42:55,552
Mom passed away a few years ago.

1207
01:42:55,983 --> 01:42:58,536
They really were a perfect couple.

1208
01:42:58,954 --> 01:43:01,260
After the fall of Mezarte,

1209
01:43:01,398 --> 01:43:04,059
Lang helped to move them back here.

1210
01:43:05,134 --> 01:43:06,878
It wasn't an easy life,

1211
01:43:07,127 --> 01:43:10,552
but I think they were incredibly happy.

1212
01:43:12,561 --> 01:43:13,907
Come on.

1213
01:43:15,053 --> 01:43:17,135
Just wait, it's coming.

1214
01:43:17,268 --> 01:43:22,222
They spoke of you all the time,
they were so happy together.

1215
01:43:22,589 --> 01:43:24,922
I'm glad you made it in time.

1216
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:28,090
Father is, well...

1217
01:43:58,914 --> 01:43:59,865
I'm home.

1218
01:44:00,665 --> 01:44:01,838
Erial.

1219
01:44:11,894 --> 01:44:14,843
You did so well, my son.

1220
01:44:18,316 --> 01:44:20,074
Such a life.

1221
01:44:22,915 --> 01:44:25,167
You lived with all you had,

1222
01:44:25,268 --> 01:44:28,855
a truly wonderful life, my little boy.

1223
01:44:34,047 --> 01:44:35,548
But I won't cry.

1224
01:44:35,844 --> 01:44:38,888
I'm a mother and I promised you.

1225
01:44:44,973 --> 01:44:46,120
Huh?

1226
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:53,600
Mom.

1227
01:44:54,261 --> 01:44:57,614
Welcome home.

1228
01:45:05,730 --> 01:45:07,143
I am home.

1229
01:45:45,589 --> 01:45:46,549
Hm.

1230
01:45:55,148 --> 01:45:57,756
I'll see you soon, my Erial.

1231
01:45:59,602 --> 01:46:03,295
Make sure you're home for dinner, OK?

1232
01:46:09,322 --> 01:46:10,815
These are for you.

1233
01:46:11,168 --> 01:46:12,301
Thank you.

1234
01:46:33,019 --> 01:46:35,259
Mom! Mommy!

1235
01:46:35,403 --> 01:46:38,907
Welcome home, Mommy. I know, I know.

1236
01:46:38,932 --> 01:46:41,728
Mommy, I'm home! Good morning, Mom.

1237
01:46:42,592 --> 01:46:44,180
I tricked you!?

1238
01:46:44,274 --> 01:46:45,839
You thought I shed my skin, right?

1239
01:46:45,864 --> 01:46:47,582
Is it the same place I was born?

1240
01:46:47,582 --> 01:46:50,636
But, Mom, time to start the party.

1241
01:46:51,331 --> 01:46:55,548
Dita's mom says you're different from
everybody else, but I don't think so.

1242
01:46:55,548 --> 01:46:56,716
'Cause I wanted to show you what I made.

1243
01:46:56,716 --> 01:46:58,364
Mommy, but why?

1244
01:46:58,389 --> 01:47:01,444
You don't act like the mommy I know when we're here.

1245
01:47:01,469 --> 01:47:03,441
I make you cry.

1246
01:47:03,466 --> 01:47:05,558
As long as I'm with you, I'm OK.

1247
01:47:05,558 --> 01:47:08,019
Mommy, I'll always protect you. Hey, Mom.

1248
01:47:08,019 --> 01:47:10,021
Even moms? Mommy.

1249
01:47:10,021 --> 01:47:12,607
Oh, hey there. See you soon.

1250
01:47:12,607 --> 01:47:14,287
It'll be fine, I promise.

1251
01:47:14,312 --> 01:47:17,946
I guess so. Don't worry about it.

1252
01:47:17,946 --> 01:47:19,656
I hate this. I'm home!

1253
01:47:19,656 --> 01:47:21,533
I don't think I can be your son anymore.

1254
01:47:21,533 --> 01:47:23,187
You think I don't know that?

1255
01:47:23,313 --> 01:47:26,121
I wanna protect her, but I can't, not like this.

1256
01:47:26,121 --> 01:47:28,219
I'm just not strong enough.

1257
01:47:28,290 --> 01:47:31,960
Why does she care about me? Why does she stay with me?

1258
01:47:32,064 --> 01:47:34,017
You've taught me everything, Mom.

1259
01:47:34,212 --> 01:47:36,305
Please, don't go.

1260
01:47:36,506 --> 01:47:38,229
Please, Mom!

1261
01:47:38,729 --> 01:47:40,915
I'm sorry, Erial.

1262
01:47:41,219 --> 01:47:42,681
Mommy?

1263
01:47:43,741 --> 01:47:44,914
I'm sorry.

1264
01:47:45,376 --> 01:47:49,410
Then I won't cry again, after all, I'm a mom.

1265
01:47:50,057 --> 01:47:51,690
You promise me?

1266
01:47:52,919 --> 01:47:54,963
Your mother has to...

1267
01:47:56,276 --> 01:47:57,902
...break her promise.

1268
01:48:03,092 --> 01:48:05,118
Mom!

1269
01:48:08,872 --> 01:48:11,875
I love you so much!

1270
01:48:13,181 --> 01:48:14,967
I love you!

1271
01:48:27,390 --> 01:48:28,643
Erial.

1272
01:48:34,856 --> 01:48:36,781
My Erial.

1273
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:57,774
Done already?

1274
01:48:58,328 --> 01:48:59,114
No.

1275
01:48:59,834 --> 01:49:01,727
As long as I'm alive,

1276
01:49:02,333 --> 01:49:05,054
Erial's Hibial will still be woven.

1277
01:49:08,598 --> 01:49:10,222
It's not funny.

1278
01:49:10,355 --> 01:49:13,765
It's just the elder would laugh
if she saw your face right now.

1279
01:49:20,717 --> 01:49:22,143
And you know why?

1280
01:49:22,317 --> 01:49:25,882
She'd be happy to have taught you
that leaving someone isn't all sad.

1281
01:49:31,329 --> 01:49:33,062
Hop on, let's go.

1282
01:49:33,315 --> 01:49:35,982
Time to meet the next person you'll have to leave.

1283
01:49:45,260 --> 01:49:46,429
Elder...

1284
01:49:48,047 --> 01:49:51,259
I am happy that I met him.

1285
01:49:52,811 --> 01:49:55,473
I'm happy to have been his mother.

1286
01:49:57,480 --> 01:50:01,340
I am happy that I loved him.
