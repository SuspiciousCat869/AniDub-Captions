1
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:15,768
Uhh... The data you see on the screen is our Music Business Division's proposal, based on

2
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,570
a SWOT analysis.

3
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:22,542
It forms the basis for our schedule during the current period. Events and show shows that lose

4
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:23,743
money will be outsourced, and---

5
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,545
Next!

6
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:29,048
Our Business Publishing Division has implemented cost-cutting measures in conjunction with the

7
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,184
switchover in our media format, but...

8
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:33,153
...we have yet to attain our goals in this---

9
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,554
Next!

10
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:35,088
Uhh...

11
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:37,090
Uh, yes. Good morning.

12
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:39,826
I'm here.. from the Hero Business Division.

13
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:43,096
So, now... The first thing I want to mention...

14
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:43,763
[groaning]

15
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,265
Get to the point.

16
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:49,068
Yes sir! As our report of income and expenses shows, we expect to yield

17
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,436
a profit for this fiscal year.

18
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,407
This is due, I believe, to the popularity of HERO TV.

19
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,208
Right.

20
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,076
Unfortunately,

21
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,914
The only issue we have is with our two Second-League Heroes, who are under contract.

22
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:04,484
At the present time, they continue to lose money.

23
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,220
Ah! Stop him! He took my purse!

24
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,454
Outta my way!

25
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,191
[grunting]

26
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,327
You're not getting away!

27
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,564
Bleh! Salty!

28
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:21,501
[grunting] Hey!

29
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:22,769
[gasping]

[grunting]

32
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:31,544
Hey, you!

33
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:31,878
Hm?

34
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,479
Over here!

35
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,718
Can't you guys even stall him?

36
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:40,653
[panting and grunting]

37
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:43,590
[grunting]

38
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:44,824
That poison's going to leave you...

39
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:45,625
Itchy!

40
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,728
Helpless is the word I was going for!

41
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,496
[grunting]

42
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,099
Pull it together, you guys!

43
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:54,500
Mr. Tiger!

44
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,137
This little game of tag is over!

45
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,439
Oh, damnit!

46
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:02,609
All right! Time for a Wild Roar!

47
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,413
Oh, for cryin' out loud!

48
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,615
Huh?

49
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,149
Well, at least I got the job done.

50
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,284
Let go of me!

51
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,853
That's not gonna happen, pal. It's over.

52
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:16,856
[gasping]

53
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:22,495
[screaming]

54
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,367
Lucky me!

55
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:31,571
[groaning]

56
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,207
What are you doing down here? Get it together!

57
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,908
What took you so long?!

58
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,912
I had previous commitments. Don't worry, though. I'm gonna make up for it.

59
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,788
[grunting]

60
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,892

[cheering]

62
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,929
That was amazing, Mr. Barnaby!

63
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,799
You saved our butts again!

64
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,834
[squealing]

65
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,236
Hey! It's Kotetsu!

66
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:04,437
Try harder, Kotetsu!

67
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,173
That's Wild Tiger, if you don't mind, folks!

68
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,475
Why yell? Everybody knows your identity.

69
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,145
A hero's not supposed to have his identity revealed!

70
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:17,116
Why are you worried about that? You should really be focusing on your apprehension skills.

71
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:17,784
What?!

72
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,118
Easy, now!

73
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,628
Karina, I saw your show the other day...!

74
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:32,331
And I have to tell you, you were great as the frail heroine!

75
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,300
Thanks a lot.

76
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,537
Do you think our friend might have been watching, as well? The old man with the beard?

77
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,504
Huh?

78
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,239
Don't you play innocent with me, Sugar.

79
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,475
I miss my handsome hunk Barnaby as well.

80
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,943
Don't lump me in with you!

81
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,111
I'm sorry!

82
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:48,181
Don't apologize. It's not the least bit necessary.

83
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:53,519
But why would you do something like that? I was surprised to see you copying my pose.

84
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,388
It became all the talk at my company.

85
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:57,623
Yeah, guess I blew it, didn't I?

86
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:58,424
Sorry.

87
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,393
Is it just me... or is he desperate?

88
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:05,364
Well, you can't really blame him. Since Tiger left, his lack of popularity stands out.

89
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,867
I guess you're right. Poor Bison.

90
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,636
Huh?

91
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,307
Hello Heroes! There's a bank robbery happening on Bastet Street.

92
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,609
Are you ready to give them another good show?

93
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:17,376
Yes!

94
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,544
Thanks for buying lunch, sir!

95
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:21,247
Sure! Now help yourselves.

96
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,782
Huh? What are you doing?!

97
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:26,419
The vinegar helps your body recover! Don't take out all the pickles!

98
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,553
They upset my stomach!

99
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,522
Hey, there's something going on!

100
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:33,226
That response was extremely fast! Our heroes have already gone into the bank!

101
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,028
All right, guys, it's time to pay attention and learn!

102
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,029
Sir!

103
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,632
You should really pay attention too, Kotetsu.

104
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,501
Huh?

105
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,270
You've been using your powers without thinking. And as a result, some criminals have escaped.

106
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:47,840
Hey, that's not my fault! My power only lasts for a minute!

107
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,909
Then maybe you should time yourself better!

108
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,444
Easy, now!

109
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:54,781
[yelling]

110
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,816
F-i-i-r-e!

111
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:57,950
[gasping]

112
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:58,951
Hyyyyyaaah!

113
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,520
[grunting]

114
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:02,822
Uh!

115
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:03,456
Ahhhhh!

116
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,690
[grunting]

117
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,659
Ha!

118
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,495
Like a streak of lightning!

119
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:14,066
Our two heroes vying for third took down the criminals at the same time!

120
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:16,469
Stay down!

121
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:17,036
[whimpering]

122
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,538
[growling]

123
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:19,939
Hm?

124
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,941
Now I've got you!

125
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,376
What the hey...?!

126
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:27,947
He's done it! Origami Cyclone scores, using his shape-shifting ability!

127
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,816
Stay back!

128
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,317
I got this one.

129
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,621
[panicking]

130
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:43,763
Sorry, my friend, my ice is a little cold...! But your crime has been completely put on hold!

131
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,533
A perfect arrest, from Blue Rose!

132
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:53,439
Look! Is Rock Bison just now sneaking into the background? Stealth Soldier, what do you make of this?

133
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:59,111
Well, what can I say? he's doing a great job of letting everyone else take the spotlight.

134
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,847
[laughing]

135
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,848
Idiot...

136
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:07,520
This is terrible, ladies and gentlemen! The robbers have apparently blown up the bank, and

137
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,889
are now trying to make a getaway!

138
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:17,630
Don't worry, I'm on it! Prepare yourselves, evil-doers! Sky High!

139
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:26,205
[screaming]

140
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:31,711
Just what we'd expect from the King of Heroes! He showed them why he's the King!

141
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:36,449
The First League really is something. They handle their challenges on a whole different level.

142
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:40,520
In the next six months... We're really gonna have to step up our game.

143
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,321
I understand your ambition, pal.

144
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,625
But no matter what we do, we can't join them before next season.

145
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,928
And besides that, there's no guarantee they'll even promote us.

146
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,731
I'm losing my feel for real battle, every day.

147
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:56,802
Why are you getting so upset? As long as we protect people, who cares what league it is?

148
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,439
Second League not good enough? Is that it?

149
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:01,540
Uh--

150
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,175
Don't you feel held back?

151
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,446
Well.. It's not like we could get involved in every incident, anyway.

152
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,882
Not to mention.. The pay is less.

153
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,083
Mmm.

154
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,621
Hello?

155
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:19,892
So you're Barnaby, is that right? I like what you did to your hair.

156
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,127
Thanks?

157
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,031
And you.. look more like a raccoon.. than you do a tiger.

158
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,066
[awkward chuckling]

159
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:31,003
Mr. Mark Schneider has offered to bail us out of a bad situation. In order to avoid bankruptcy, he's

160
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,940
offered to buy the company, lock, stock and barrel!

161
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,875
Really?!

162
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:40,379
Ever since the Maverick incident, I've started to think of Apollon as a business opportunity.

163
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:45,451
I've heard a lot about you. As a young man, you founded Gargoyle Technica, and built it

164
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,553
into one of the top IT empires in the world.

165
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:52,391
He's done much more than that! He's done a marvelous job of resurrecting absolutely

166
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,993
every company he's acquired.

167
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:57,863
Wow! So, what does that have to do with us?

168
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,933
Actually, I'm at a loss as to what to do with you two.

169
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,268
Uh--

170
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,603
After all, you're not contributing to the company's profitability.

171
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:07,473
I thought about firing you. However...

172
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,675
I'm going to apply a reverse strategy...

173
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,944
By promoting you to First League!

174
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:12,979
Uh--

175
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,748
That's odd. I was expecting more of a reaction.

176
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,784
I just told you guys you're back in the First League.

177
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,319
Uhh... You serious?

178
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:23,622
Normally, the committee doesn't add heroes on mid-season...

179
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:26,492
... but Mr. Schneider asked for an exception.

180
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:27,493
[gasping in awe]

181
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,328
Congratulations to both of you guys!

182
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,531
Thanks so much, Ben! Isn't this great, Bunny?

183
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,033
We don't know the conditions, yet.

184
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:37,103
Who cares what they are? We're in the First League!

185
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,004
Yeah, but--

186
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,673
Don't worry about the details! Virgil!

187
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,575
You can decide your own salary.

188
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:43,609
What?!

189
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:45,811
That's how much I value your presence.

190
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,447
Thank you very much.

191
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,884
I've heard a lot about you. You've been a Hero for a long time.

192
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:52,852
Yeah...

193
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,021
Maybe you can tell me some of your stories...

194
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,555
Oh, sure!

195
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,190
Is it good?

196
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,692
Take your time.

197
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,694
[alarm wailing]

198
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:04,930
What an awful noise! It's creepy!

199
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,600
[howling]

200
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,168
Ah!

201
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,970
[screaming]

202
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:18,811
'The sun is the source of all life. It fulfills us and blesses us with moments of freedom. As

203
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:23,716
long as these two phoenixes dance in my eyes.'

204
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,217
What do you think of that, Dad?

205
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:29,155
Nice verse! Really, sweetie, it brought tears to my eyes!

206
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:29,955
You're kidding!

207
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,191
I'm lost. This thing makes no sense!

208
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,126
Huh?

209
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,096
It's a poem my teacher recommended I read. But I really don't get it at all.

210
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,031
Well, it is a little hard to follow..

211
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,734
What? But you said it made you cry!

212
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,736
Were you even paying attention, Dad?

213
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:48,040
Well of course I was! But let me tell you, being forced to write a poem about the sun.. sounds

214
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,009
like a very difficult assignment.

215
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,711
Yeah, it's not easy being a kid these days.

216
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,113
So.. How are you?

217
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,615
Are you and Barnaby getting along?

218
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,951
Yeah! Everything's going great!

219
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,729
Wow! Let me see. Thirty dollars a glass.. would make a total of---

220
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,598
Excuse me, I'm on the phone!

221
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,333
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am!

222
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,768
How's it going? You done?

223
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,536
No, not quite.

224
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,907
We won't be back in time. We still have to cover that cat that had quintuplets.

225
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,844
They're forcing you to cover an unimportant local story?

226
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:29,381
What can I do? This is what happens when they lay off staff and we're stretched too thin.

227
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,217
They're beginning.

228
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,586
Yeah, whatever.

229
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:37,156
We will now begin the press conference, in which we will be announcing the return of

230
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,425
a pair of Heroes to our ranks.

231
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:46,365
But first allow me to introduce this man. Our new owner, Mark Schneider!

232
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,067
[chatting]

233
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,670
Hello, everyone! And thank you all for coming out tonight!

234
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,906
I can't believe we get to work together again!

235
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,374
It's good to be back.

236
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,242
Behind you all the way!

237
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,811
I want you to do your best, Kotetsu!

238
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,279
Sure, boss, whatever you say.

239
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:00,980
[chuckling]

240
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,648
Aren't you gonna say hi to him?

241
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,817
Huh? He hasn't said hi to me.

242
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,218
[giggling]

243
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,687
We'll be watching you guys from up in the V.I.P. section.

244
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:09,622
See you guys later!

245
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,756
Everything feels right again.

246
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,992
Don't mess up out there.. with your speech.

247
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,994
Right back at ya, pal.

248
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:18,764
All right everyone, I think you've heard more than enough about me for one day. It's time to

249
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:23,302
bring out our company's heroes! First up is a man you may be familiar with...!

250
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:27,873
After both his parents were murdered when he was just a child, this tragic figure became a hero to

251
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:32,878
fight for justice. He put an end to Jake's reign of terror, which had shaken the entire city. While

252
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:37,816
pursuing the mysterious organization known as Ouroboros, he came across his parent's true killer

253
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:44,323
and was able to take his revenge. He is the superhero, Barnaby Brooks, Jr.!

254
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,625
See you in a bit.

255
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,359
Sure will.

256
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:52,965
[cheering]

257
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:54,967
Kotetsu's next.

258
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,938
Next up, allow me to introduce the Hero who will be partnering with Barnaby...

259
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:03,742
He's very experienced in this field.. and in his career, has solved many cases!

260
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,244
The two will be a perfect match!

261
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,112
Tiger's inside that balloon?

262
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,981
Schneider really went all out!

263
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,952
Now let me present, the superhero...

264
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,389
...Golden Ryan...!

265
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,360
[gasping]

266
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:26,131
[murmuring]

267
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:29,501
Oh, come on, really? This is the welcome I get?

268
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,136
Well, check this.

269
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:38,010
Do-Don!

270
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:45,417
As you can see, this is the power of the Wandering Gravity Prince, Golden Ryan!

271
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,219
[gasping]

272
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:51,490
In time, the world will bow at my feet! Mark my words!

273
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:52,858
[gasping] Wha--

274
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:56,195
He fights crime by amplifying the force of gravity, and then stopping

275
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,631
motion within a specific radius.

276
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:02,301
I've been told our new friend is a hero from the Continental Area.

277
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,536
The new owner was able to scout him out.

278
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,504
Wait! What about Kotetsu?!

279
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:08,173
Wasn't Tiger going to be brought back, as well?

280
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,542
Well, that's what I was led to believe.

281
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:14,913
[panting]

282
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,716
Nice try, sucker. Now kiss my boots!

283
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:28,193
That's the reality. I plan to team Barnaby with a Hero who has more promise than you.

284
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,095
Wait a minute! That's not what you said!

285
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:33,332
When did I ever say I was gonna pair these two again?

286
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:34,500
Uh--

287
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:37,303
I have no use for a man who's past his prime already.

288
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,104
[gasping]

289
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:42,107
Sorry about that... But I only had you come here with Barnaby today so that he wouldn't freak

290
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,977
out, and resist signing his contract.

291
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,445
That was a low trick!

292
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:51,283
I tried to make a case out of it, but Kotetsu stopped me.

293
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,118
But why?

294
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:57,256
We have been assured, you can expect great things to come, from the team of Ryan and Barnaby!

295
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,158
This wasn't part of our agreement.

296
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:02,094
Excuse me, but you signed the contract, remember?

297
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,797
Yes, but.. no-one said I'd be switching partners!

298
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:10,002
What the hell are you griping about? The money's good. It's really not a bad deal.

299
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,837
I wasn't speaking to you, pal.

300
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,272
Hm!

301
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,040
Are you listening to me, Mr. Schneider? We're not done yet!

302
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,209
Let it go, Bunny.

303
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,043
Kotetsu!

304
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,978
Oh! Is this the raccoon I heard about?

305
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:25,184
Hey, good job on your appearance back there. I always thought you were great on stage.

306
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:26,085
Hm.

307
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,024
Are you okay with this, Kotetsu?

308
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:34,693
Yeah, the timing was right.

309
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,863
You've been stuck in the Second League because of me.

310
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:41,266
I don't want to hold you back any more than I already have, Bunny.

311
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,035
You don't hold me back.

312
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,604
You really don't have to protect my feelings.

313
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,906
I'm not. Believe me.

314
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,409
I know what I am, and I'm all right with it.

315
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,444
Kotetsu, you're the reason I agreed to--

316
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:57,149
The fact is, the Second League works out better for me. The hours are more flexible, and I can

317
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,085
spend more time with Kaede.

318
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:03,155
Bottom line, it suits my lifestyle. It's a good fit.

319
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,657
Are you sure? Do you really mean that?

320
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,259
Yeah.

321
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:11,163
And that's the extent of your commitment? Your whole reason for being a Hero?

322
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,334
Are you saying that Second-Leaguers aren't heroes?

323
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,504
Are you measuring that by the money?

324
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,605
Hm?

325
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,540
Just because the First League pays better, doesn't--

326
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,275
Don't be crass.

327
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:27,513
Oh, I don't hold it against you. I guess you just see things a lot differently than I do,

328
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,147
that's all.

329
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,782
What are you trying to say?

330
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:33,685
Look, all I'm sayin' is maybe it's time you and I go our separate ways.

331
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,089
Mm!

332
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,490
Good luck.

333
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:42,561
Mmph.

334
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:55,107
Breaking news! A crack has formed in the Amethyst Tower! The cause is still unknown!

335
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,476
Authorities say it could topple at any moment!

336
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,412
We are hoping for the Heroes to arrive as soon as possible!

337
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:03,515
Fantastic! This is gonna make for some good drama!

338
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,618
These guys are lucky to have this incident to make their debut!

339
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,225
Hm.

340
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,260
Hey, how come I'm stuck in the side car?!

341
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,129
I think it suits you well.

342
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,467
Ready to go, I see.

343
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,236
You're driving?

344
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,904
That gonna be a problem?

345
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,407
Nope. That should work out perfectly.

346
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,243
Ahh... That's comfy.

347
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,378
Let's get this buggy movin', Junior.

348
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:37,216
Tell me I mis-heard you. Did you just call me 'junior'?

349
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,386
[howling]

350
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,455
Hey... What's that sound?

351
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:44,456
Beats me.

352
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,290
Huh?!

353
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,694
Look out! It's starting to go!

354
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,530
[grunting]

355
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,310
Going in now isn't gonna earn you any points!

356
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:08,247
That's not the issue! There are people inside!

357
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,716
Guess there's no choice...

358
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,389
Do-Don!

359
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,758
What's happening?

360
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:20,659
Can't move...!

361
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,528
That jerk...!

362
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,364
Ahhh!

363
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:29,201
What is going on here? This is terrible! It appears that Golden Ryan has pinned down his fellow

364
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,670
heroes! None of them are able to move!

365
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:32,671
[grunting]

366
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:33,739
Ryan!

367
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,208
Neutralizing your associates is against the rules!

368
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,376
Relax, lady.

369
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:38,010
Huh?

370
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,678
I know what I'm doing.

371
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,324
Look at that! Ryan is using the radio towers to stop the building from collapsing!

372
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,359
Yeah! I'm awesome!

373
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,029
That's debatable. But what are we supposed to do now?

374
00:19:57,062 --> 00:20:01,433
Think about it. You can still move, can't you, Junior?

375
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,335
[grunting]

376
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,605
[straining]

377
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,240
That's it! Move!

378
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:11,276
Barnaby has activated his powers!

379
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:15,581
Make it quick. It's all for nothing if we don't show some teamwork.

380
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:16,148
Yeah, but...

381
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,049
[screaming]

382
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,384
This is not how a hero works!

383
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,587
It is if it scores points.

384
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,456
[groaning]

385
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,793
Hup!

386
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:33,265
[panicking]

387
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,267
[screaming]

388
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,535
They beat us to the rescue.

389
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,270
Was that move even legal?

390
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,372
It sure looked suspicious!

391
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,407
You're safe now.

392
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:46,445
It was right in front of me! I saw it! I saw a monster trash that building!

393
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:47,579
Huh?

394
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,381
A huge shadow came across my window, and a big ro--

395
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,650
Please, madam, calm down!

396
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,419
Great work, Junior!

397
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:58,056
That was a spectacular catch! You look very cool in action!

398
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,325
Mmm.

399
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:04,896
Close call! For a moment, we feared the worst, but the day was saved, thanks to the newest Hero team,

400
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,665
Ryan and Barnaby!

401
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:10,669
They displayed wonderful teamwork! Can't believe they're a brand-new pairing.

402
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:15,073
Keep it up, kid. I'll try to do my best, in the Second League.

403
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:20,779
[cheering]

404
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:31,690
I propose a death match between heroes and savage animals! Now that would be entertainment! Those

405
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:36,595
NEXT aren't human anyway. We've gotta get extreme, you know?

406
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:40,098
How come he's staring like that? Hey!

407
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:46,171
OBC, which operates the HERO-TV network, is a subsidiary of Apollon. And we have the authority

408
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,340
to silence the seven major companies.

409
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:53,178
All that would be left in the process is for you people in the Justice Bureau to give it your approval.

410
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,681
I understand. We'll look into it.

411
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:56,615
[whistling]

412
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,550
May I point out one thing?

413
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,885
Hm?

414
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,821
The Second League personnel have been left out of the contract.

415
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:05,157
Heh.

416
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:10,495
Thank you for your generosity, as always. The other day, you even came by before work.

417
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:14,166
True. But this work gives me great pleasure.

418
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:19,004
Let me read for your children. 'Long ago, in a time when mankind knew nothing of

419
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:24,209
true Justice, a Goddess built a small village on the land of Stern Bild.'

420
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:29,481
Justice Day... is right around the corner. Will you be attending?

421
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,550
I wish we could, but we don't have the funds.

422
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:37,556
'Driven by greed, the villagers quarreled and looted for their own personal gain.'

423
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:45,163
'Unable to tolerate such misdeeds, the Goddess sent down a messenger, a crab, to warn the people.'

424
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:50,035
'The crab spoke. Repent of your sins, or be punished!'

425
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:56,775
'But its word fell upon deaf ears and the poor crab was consumed.'

426
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:04,683
'Saddened, the Goddess appeared from the heavens to bring judgment upon the villagers. What

427
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,718
followed was utter chaos.'

428
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:12,724
'Rays of light, sharper and stronger than steel blades, began raining from the sky! Cattle and

429
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:17,329
horses dove into the ocean in fear.'

430
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:23,468
'Countless people fell into a deep sleep, trapped in a maze of nightmares.'

431
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:27,906
I remember that. My parents used to tell it to me. Uh?

432
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:28,774
Hm?

433
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:29,674
[gasping]

434
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,443
You can't do this to us!

435
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:32,811
How did this happen, do you know?

436
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,847
Mr. Schneider proposed it to the Board of Directors.

437
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,283
They passed it immediately, from what I heard.

438
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:39,684
In other words, you weren't even there!

439
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,486
I want to talk to the man directly!

440
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,423
That won't happen. Mr. Schneider won't be meeting with any of you.

441
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,458
Oh, come on!

442
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,627
He left a last message for you all.

443
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,029
Its says.. 'Bye-bye.'

444
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,831
[gasping]

445
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:56,735
Uh--

446
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,705
Thank you for all your help today, Mr. Schneider!

447
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:04,309
Get him there quickly, but don't rush. Stay off the freeways.

448
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:07,345
I don't really care for your suck-up attitude, all right?

449
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:08,447
Oh, uh--

450
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,715
Something about you rubs me the wrong way.

451
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:14,052
From now on, you and I will have limited contact.

452
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:15,854
Yes sir, but...

453
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:19,324
Nothing seems to be quite going the way we want, is it?

454
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:20,992
Huh?

455
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,929
I've been having difficulty mastering this new technique I came up with.

456
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,363
Hmm.

457
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:28,333
I thought it might be useful if I could find a way to shape my lightning.

458
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:31,603
But I can't seem to get it right, no matter how many times I try.

459
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,672
Sorry, kiddo. What is it you're trying to say?

460
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:37,342
It's hard enough to get things to work out when it's just yourself. But it's a

461
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:40,879
million times harder when you're dealing with other people and businesses.

462
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:42,981
Like what happened with Mr. Tiger.

463
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,516
Hm.

464
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:46,318
Hold on!

465
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:50,355
We can't let ourselves get depressed as well! That's no good! Try to smile!

466
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:53,892
I really envy you, Fire Emblem! You're always so positive!

467
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:59,097
That's because I don't have a care in the world, honey. I'm always happy about something.

468
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,498
This really sucks!

469
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,801
It must have been a huge shock for Mr. Wild.

470
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,838
Uh-huh. Especially after all he accomplished for HERO-TV.

471
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:10,642
Of course the last thing he's gonna want is sympathy from others.

472
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,677
At least, not from an unpopular guy like me.

473
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,145
That's not true!

474
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,047
Hm?

475
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:19,517
You may not be the most popular guy on the block, but the way you go after the criminals head-on...

476
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,786
...makes you a bona-fide hero.

477
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,656
You think so?

478
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:29,494
Well, in comparison, all I'm able to do is use my shape-shifting to attack from behind.

479
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:34,699
That makes me kind of a cowardly hero. And not really in a position to be of much help to Tiger.

480
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,801
That's not true. Not true at all!

481
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:37,636
Huh?

482
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:39,471
You're a great hero! One of the best!

483
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:41,239
[chuckling]

I gotta tell you, Sky High, you have a funny way of stating the obvious.

00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,611
Is that on purpose?

...Everyone seems to think it's funny, and then they laugh at me.

Yeah. She jumped in front of me, out of nowhere!

I swerved to avoid her... And went flying.

558

So what happened to her?

559
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:04,636
I thought I hit her! But when I got out of the truck, I couldn't find her anywhere.

That sounds like a lie! Are you trying to cover up your bad driving?!

No! I'm telling you thetruth!

I heard a strange howling sound, and the next thing I knew, the woman was there in front of me!

00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:15,480
A howling sound, you say?

Could it be the same one we heard the other day?

Hm?

566
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:23,087
You know. Just before the building collapsed, we heard.. 'ohhh!' Was that it?

567
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:26,024
That's it, exactly! It was very distracting.

568
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:27,792
Huh?

569
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:31,095
So what's going on? Does that mean this accident and the one from the other day are related?

570
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,764
The Legend of the Goddess...

Huh? What was that?

It's just.. All these accidents.. They closely resemble the legend.

Huh?

'Buildings were destroyed, and the livestock fell into the sea.'

Just for argument's sake, let's say it's true. We haven't seen any goddess yet.

Hm?

582
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:03,261
Referring back to that Goddess story... The old cat lady we went to

583
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,830
interview thee other day, told us something very similar.

584
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:09,734
She said she heard an eerie sound and then the window glass shattered and

585
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:12,670
she saw the shadow of a Goddess.

586
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,273
I didn't give it a second thought at the time. But from what you've been saying...

587

The shadow of a Goddess...?

588
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:19,944
You think it's possible that rays of light are what shattered the glass?

589
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:24,882
Come to think of it, when the building collapsed, a woman said she saw the shadow of a huge monster.

590
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,051
Are you saying that was the Goddess?

591
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:29,954
Hold on! What happened in the legend, after that?

Ben got me this job. You know, just until the Second-League gets reinstated.

646
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:37,375
There are no plans to resume the Second League. And the seven major companies are no help.

647
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,310
They're not interested in hiring you, either.

648
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,446
Uh--

649
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:44,248
Well, there are other shows like HERO-TV that are being broadcast around the world.

650
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:45,950
If worst comes to worst---

651
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:49,921
Hey, you know what? Maybe it would be better if you accepted reality.

652
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:54,392
Stop clinging to outdated dreams, and make do with what you can, here in the real world.

653
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,462
Take my word for it, it's for your own good.

654
00:34:58,529 --> 00:34:59,497
[grunting]

655
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:02,500
Here you go! I brought presents for everybody!

656
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:06,104
Good to see you. Welcome home, dear. How was your day at work?

657
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:07,738
Everything went well.

658
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:17,515
Uhh---

659
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,620
Is this where I think it is?

660
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,360
[hesitating]

661
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:31,629
I knew it!

662
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,531
So the rumors were true!

663
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:36,534
You know something, Nathan? You're creepy!

664
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,539
[gasping]

665
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,077
You mean he might stay like this forever?

666
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:50,114
His brainwaves are identical to someone in a state of shallow sleep. Whether or

667
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:53,451
not he'll come out of it may depend on the strength of his will.

668
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,954
The other victims exhibit the same symptoms as Fire Emblem.

669
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:00,992
None of them show any signs of regaining consciousness.

670
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:05,263
He has the sleeping sickness. It's just like the one that was described in the legend.

671
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:09,200
Who were these guys that put him under?! And what is it they're after?!

672
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:11,068
Maybe they're trying to start a revolution.

673
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,271
Excuse me, a what?!

674
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:17,842
Think about it. According to the legend, the Goddess brought calamity to make people repent.

675
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:21,379
When you consider that none of these incidents led to any casualties...

676
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:23,080
...It's a white-collar crime!

677
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:24,949
Hm?

678
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:28,119
So tell me something.. According to this legend, what is this Goddess supposed to do?

679
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:29,320
Something calamitous?

680
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,622
Huh? You don't know the story?

681
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:35,826
Why would you expect that? I'm not from anywhere around these parts.

682
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,495
So, what does she do?

683
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:42,400
She punishes everyone.

684
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:45,069
Despite suffering the Goddess's wrath, the people still did not learn to change their

685
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:49,607
ways. Finally, the Goddess decided to return everything to nothingness by opening a

686
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:55,313
cavernous abyss, deep and dark enough to engulf the entire village. Buried beneath the eternal

687
00:36:55,346 --> 00:37:02,553
darkness, the villagers finally learned the error of their ways, and began to carry a heart of justice.

688
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:03,921
Excuse me?

689
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:07,124
You mean we can expect a hole to open under the city, any minute?

690
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,359
Ha!

691
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:14,432
We'll assume that old man has the power to put people to sleep.

692
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:17,702
And the man who looked like a boxer was causing that sound?

693
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,003
No question.

694
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:21,839
Believe me, those sounds were definitely coming from that guy.

695
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:24,442
That woman can create duplicates of herself.

696
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:26,644
That only leaves the question of the Goddess.

697
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:29,213
You really think their goal is to start a revolution?

698
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:33,050
Whatever it is, I'm pretty sure everything will become clear tomorrow.

699
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,619
Huh?

700
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:37,288
Tomorrow is the day the Goddess opened the abyss to bury the village.

701
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,323
It's called Justice Day.

702
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:42,760
[grunting softly]

703
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:46,864
A look at the schedule shows there are many events happening on this year's Justice Day.

704
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:48,532
You're right...

705
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:52,203
It's going to be a special day for everyone. I remember how excited I was when I went

706
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:58,209
with my first boyfriend. Hope you all have a fun and exciting Justice Day tomorrow.

707
00:37:58,242 --> 00:37:59,644
I see.

708
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:03,381
We believe Mr. Schneider's proposal is morally questionable.

709
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:08,152
I'll inform him of your decision. If we need anything else, we'll be in contact.

710
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:09,520
May I ask you a question?

711
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:11,355
Yes?

712
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:16,294
Don't the employees have issues...? I mean, with Mr. Schneider's overall management philosophy?

713
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:19,096
I wouldn't be qualified to comment on that.

714
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:31,008
Don't take out all the pickles! The vinegar helps your body recover!

715
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:36,314
You should see this! The newscasts are doing special reports on the festival!

716
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,149
The ratings are gonna be up tomorrow, for sure!

717
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:43,187
The ratings may be a nice side benefit, but don't forget, we're heroes first.

718
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,588
Oh, there you go again.

719
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:46,257
Huh?

720
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,226
For such a young guy, Junior, I gotta say, you sure act like a square sometimes.

721
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,628
S'cuse me?

722
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,797
I wonder if that's your previous partner's influence...

723
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,899
Mm.

724
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:58,569
Don't compare me with that dude too much, I mean, I'm me, ya know? Golden Ryan!

725
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:05,142
I'm not comparing the two of you. After all, he and I... We're not partners anymore.

726
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,744
Right. If you say so...

727
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:17,455
Uh-- [exhaling]

728
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:23,828
Our concern is for Fire Emblem, who still remains unconscious at this time.

729
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,229
Huh?

730
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:28,466
Of course we hope to see him back healthy, as soon as possible.

731
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:34,905
Huh?

732
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:59,697
About time he showed up.

733
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,899
I just heard. How is he?

734
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,801
See for yourself.

735
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:04,668
Uh--

736
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,904
So you're a cab driver now?

737
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:07,671
Huh?

738
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:09,140
I saw it on the internet.

739
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:12,676
Oh really? I'm telling you, you can't keep anything secret.

740
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:16,080
It all ends up online for everyone to see.

741
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:20,584
When I started this, I said I'd be a Hero until the very end. But it's hard when the public

742
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:21,852
doesn't recognize you.

743
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:24,421
Who cares what the public thinks of you?

744
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:31,228
I used to think that way, too, at one time. But I found out that reality is pretty harsh.

745
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,965
Back in the second league, Bunny used to complain a lot about our pay.

746
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:40,604
I remember thinking at the time, that's not what Heroes should be concerned about. But, unlike me, he

747
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:43,340
was always much more firmly focused on reality.

748
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,042
You really believe that?

749
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:46,076
Huh?

750
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,512
You still don't know anything about him, do you?

751
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:51,315
Your old buddy.. is out pursuing his ideals.

752
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:52,550
Hm?

753
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,718
I was at the Festival office the other morning...

754
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:57,788
So then, you're here for some tickets to the parade?

755
00:40:57,822 --> 00:40:59,657
Yes.

756
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:03,327
Are you also buying them as presents, Blue Rose? You Heroes are so generous.

757
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,296
Huh?

758
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:08,365
The other day, Barnaby came by and bought a bunch of tickets, so that he'd be able to invite

759
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:09,967
children from the orphanage!

760
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,702
Oh--

761
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:15,506
Ever since the Maverick incident, it turns out he's been doing a lot to help children like

762
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:18,175
himself, who don't have parents.

763
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:21,579
You mean that's why he's been so obsessed with money?

764
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:25,349
I wonder why he never told me that.

765
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:28,719
...This coming from the guy who hides his feelings the most.

766
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:29,887
Hm?

767
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,123
If I didn't know better, I'd say he's acting... like you.

768
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,959
Hmm.

769
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,861
Sorry kiddo, gotta go.

770
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,532
I swear... He can be so dense.

771
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:43,667
[giggling]

772
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:51,108
I guess you just see things a lot differently than I do, that's all.

773
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:55,446
... Look, all I'm saying is maybe it's time you and I go our separate ways.

774
00:41:55,479 --> 00:42:03,020
Uh!

775
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:07,691
[panting] Uh!

776
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,227
You want to go on patrol? Have you lost your mind?

777
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:13,564
There's a lot of people who are looking forward to tomorrow.

778
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:15,599
It's all right.. I'll go myself.

779
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:20,537
No way you're doin' that, Junior. That'll only help boost your own public image.

780
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:21,972
Say what?

781
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:24,542
I mean, I can't have you hog all the glory for yourself.

782
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:25,943
That's not it. I just want to---

783
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:28,145
---protect all the citizens, right?

784
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:30,080
I get ya.

785
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:31,849
Mm.

786
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:33,450
Here we go.

787
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:34,652
Right!

788
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:43,794
[struggling]

789
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:45,195
[straining]

790
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:51,368
Face-to-face. Man to man!

791
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:05,816
[chatting]

792
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:06,717
Dad!

793
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:09,086
Heeyy...!

794
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,689
Kaede!

795
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:15,726
Predictable. I knew you'd try that. But I'm too old for that, you know!

796
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,795
But Kaede...!

797
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:19,530
You haven't changed one bit.

798
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:22,433
That's the truth. But you're doing better than I expected.

799
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:26,003
I'll admit, you surprised me. I didn't expect you guys to visit.

800
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:28,472
Are we... gonna be in your way?

801
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:31,108
Huh? Oh, no! I'm happy you're here!

802
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,205
What's taking them so long?

803
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:08,779
Come on! If we don't hurry, we won't be able to get a good spot.

804
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,181
It's okay, Dad. We don't have to rush.

805
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:12,149
Oh? Why is that?

806
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:13,884
'Cause... Ta - da!

807
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:14,752
Hm?

808
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:17,054
How did you get seats for a luxury box?

809
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:20,124
Miss Blue Rose was able to get them for us!

810
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,692
Huh?

811
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:23,460
To tell you the truth...

812
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:27,831
She's also the one who suggesting it would be a good idea if I came and saw you.

813
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:32,970
I see... So that's why she went to the Admin Office. Huh?

814
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:38,509
Now that I think about it...

815
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:41,779
How's the homework assignment coming? The poem about the sun...

816
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:48,852
Oh that. I guess I just don't have the talent. No matter how hard I try, I can't seem to write

817
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:51,889
something that resembles the teacher's favorite poem.

818
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:54,091
You don't really have to imitate it, you know.

819
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:57,194
But I'm sure to get a higher score if I do.

820
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:58,028
Hmm...

821
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:59,663
I think it would be better for you...

822
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:03,967
... to write an honest poem about a subject you actually care about.

823
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:08,839
Isn't it enough to do your best? Then you'll be true to yourself.

824
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,308
I've always tried to operate like that.

825
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:14,711
[cheering]

826
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:16,180
You sure about that?

827
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,147
What do you mean?

828
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:20,017
Right now, are you doing what you want to do?

829
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,386
Are you doing everything you can do?

830
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:26,323
Even when we were out today, weren't you missing being a hero?

831
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,525
[gasping]

832
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,328
You forced yourself to look happy, but I was able to see right through you.

833
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:33,297
Uh--

834
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:37,534
I don't know the details of how it all works... But if you want to be a Hero, that's what you should do!

835
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:42,606
The bottom line is, it's what's best for you, Dad. That's what I think.

836
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:44,641
Hm!

837
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:49,246
And you don't have to worry about me. I'm a NEXT, and by definition, I can take care of myself.

838
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:51,081
Now get moving! Hurry!

839
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:52,316
[groaning]

840
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,155
You're becoming just like your mother.

841
00:45:58,188 --> 00:45:59,890
Huh?

842
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:03,794
Tomoe used to push me to take action in the exact same way.

843
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:05,662
Oh? Really?

844
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,064
Thanks for the pep talk!

845
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,800
Now remember, if you need me, just call!

846
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:11,268
Never mind that, go now!

847
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:12,269
Okay!

848
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,305
[chuckling]

849
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:29,553
[cheering and music]

850
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:38,162
[cheering and music]

851
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:46,303
Looks like everyone's having a blast, buddy!

852
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:48,305
Stay focused.

853
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:51,241
[chatting]

854
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:53,544
Look at that parade! Isn't it awesome?

855
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:58,115
I don't understand. What exactly is Kotetsu planning to do, anyway?

856
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:01,852
He's not officially recognized as a Hero anymore, right?

857
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:05,355
Don't worry! Dad will pull something off!

858
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,171
Hey, how'd you get in here?

859
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:21,939
Ah!

860
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:24,341
[laughing]

861
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:25,843
[gasping]

862
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:27,711
You can't be down here!

863
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:33,283
[howling]

864
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:35,986
They've come back!

865
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,354
Hello, Heroes...

866
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:38,889
Just as we predicted...!

867
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:42,659
Apprehend them on sight and make it look good for TV.

868
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:45,262
Yes, ma'am!

869
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:46,930
Huuuuah!

870
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:49,666
[struggling]

871
00:47:57,774 --> 00:48:00,277
Ah!

872
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:03,947
[gasping]

873
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:05,682
[panicking]

874
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:19,263
[panicking]

875
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:26,203
[panicking]

876
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,405
Move out of the area! Quickly!

877
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:29,172
(Horrified breath)

878
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,945
Damn, what the hell is going on?!

879
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:37,147
This way, Kaede!

880
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,284
[screaming]

881
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:42,185
Kaede!

882
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:53,063
[coughing] Huh?

883
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:56,733
They took out the underground control station!

884
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,536
You'll have to intercept them as they reach ground level!

885
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:01,305
[gasping]

886
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:05,442
I don't see anyone here.

887
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:06,576
Barnaby!?!

888
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:09,813
Kaede! What are you doing here?!

889
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:10,881
Umm--

890
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:13,550
Young lady! You see anybody suspicious?

891
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:14,484
Hm?

892
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:17,454
Yeah, three creepy people went that way.

893
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:19,122
There they are!

894
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:22,326
You need to get yourself to someplace safe. Quickly!

895
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:28,265
He is still so hot.

896
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:32,202
Be honest with me. You thought I was the culprit, didn't you?

897
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:33,403
What?

898
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:35,138
I bet you thought I was gonna cause that hole to open.

899
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:37,107
What are you talking about? No, I didn't.

900
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,110
Yeah? Don't try lying to me...

901
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,112
You're not very good at it.

902
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:43,380
Mm.

903
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:45,482
Ryan and Barnaby are in pursuit of the suspects!

904
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:46,583
Everybody join them!

905
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:47,484
[grunting]

906
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:48,885
There!

907
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:51,288
Welcome, everybody, to HERO TV LIVE!

908
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:54,191
Our heroes are already hot in pursuit of the suspects!

909
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:58,395
It looks like these criminals have scattered in three different directions!

910
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:02,399
As a result, our Heroes are splitting up to pursue them. However...

911
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:06,036
...there still seems to be no sign of Blue Rose.

912
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:08,505
I'm counting on you, everyone. Go get 'em!

913
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:10,407
[struggling]

914
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:14,511
What? No, wait! Try to calm down, Fire Emblem.

915
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:19,983
Tiger?!

916
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,152
Just leave Fire Emblem to me. Now, go help them catch the criminals.

917
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:24,621
You won't be able to contain him with just those!

918
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:27,958
Don't you worry about me! I'm a fire extinguisher expert.

919
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:30,427
Where'd you get all of those?

920
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:33,430
Oh, and by the way, Blue Rose, thanks for everything.

921
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:34,197
What?

922
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,967
You brought me back to my senses.

923
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,568
Uh--

924
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:40,604
Now, hurry! Get your butt out of here.

925
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:45,242
Fine! Stop bossing me around. And by the way, you're starting to put on weight!

926
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:46,910
Tell me something I don't know!

927
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:48,545
[struggling]

928
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:53,350
Where the hell did she go?!

929
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:57,087
Look around. I'm right up here.

930
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,555
[giggling]

931
00:50:58,588 --> 00:50:59,623
Hold it!

932
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:02,426
So, I guess she likes playing hard to get, huh?

933
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,732
Stop! You're not getting away!

934
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:15,572
[chuckling] What a brave child, my dear. Coming after me alone with no backup.

935
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:16,540
Excuse me?

936
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:17,307
Hm?

937
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,609
She has all the back-up she needs!

938
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:25,982
There she is! Blue Rose finally makes her appearance!

939
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,718
We'll make short work of this guy! You ready?

940
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:29,586
Mm!

941
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:36,993
We've got you now, evil-doer! This is the end of the road!

942
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:38,695
Huh?

943
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:41,498
Give yourself up! Or face the consequences!

944
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:50,040
My heart is solid as a rock! And your crime is about to be put on lock!

945
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:51,608
What?

946
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:55,479
That was bad! Rock Bison just stole Blue Rose's signature catchphrase!

947
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:56,580
[growling]

948
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,949
Quit focusing on these guys! Show more of my people!

949
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:01,818
But the agreement was to give all Heroes equal air-time---

950
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:05,255
Don't tell me! I have the final say in all these matters!

951
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:08,058
You do understand what that means, don't you?

952
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:10,360
Yes, sir. We'll do whatever you wish.

953
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,162
[grunting]

954
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:20,570
Stand by for action! Ryan and Barnaby have cornered one of the suspects!

955
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,006
There's no escape for you!

956
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:28,478
[giggling] Do you think capturing me will be as simple as that?

957
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:30,413
[grunting]

958
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:41,558
That was close! The woman's circular blades sliced right through the display!

959
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:44,694
I guess it's only your face that's sweet.

960
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:47,097
I'm honored...

961
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:52,435
It's not very often that I have two handsome princes trying to get my attention!

962
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:58,675
Whoo-hoo! See anybody you'd want to date, Junior?

963
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:00,310
Don't joke around!

964
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:10,654
[grunting]

965
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:15,992
You're doing this wrong. You need to keep your eye on the girl, if you want her to fall for you.

966
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:21,331
Oh don't worry, I'll make you fall for me... One way or another.

967
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:23,466
Do-Don!

968
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:34,411
[giggling] Looks like you can't reach me up here, can you?

969
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:39,549
Don't be surprised. Women have been known to do research on the people they love.

970
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:40,383
Huh.

971
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:56,232
[snickering]

972
00:53:56,266 --> 00:54:00,604
Please... no more!!!

973
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:06,276
[grunting] Hot!

974
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:12,749
[howling]

975
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:15,285
What's the matter, guys?

976
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:18,188
That's a really annoying power he's got!

977
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:21,424
Sky High!

978
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:26,429
[howling]

979
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:31,534
Woo! You're wasting your time. You can't shut out my sound.

980
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:33,136
[grunting]

981
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:37,941
[howling]

982
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:41,878
Coming from behind like that... you play dirty.

983
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:45,915
[groaning]

984
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:49,786
[grunting]

985
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:51,655
[chuckling]

986
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:53,323
[grunting]

987
00:54:56,459 --> 00:55:00,830
Huh? Huh. [grunting]

988
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,033
[gasping]

989
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:06,703
Is that it? You guys are making this way too easy.

990
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:08,705
Huh?

991
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:11,908
Would you look at that! Your friend's running away!

992
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,510
[grunting]

993
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:19,215
Ladies and gentlemen, this is unprecedented! Origami Cyclone is fleeing the scene!

994
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:20,684
[quiet gasping]

995
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:21,484
Uh!

996
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:41,137
It's over! Prepare for your end!

997
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:46,743
[chuckling] Sorry, my dear! It's you who should prepare for the end!

998
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:49,779
No way!

999
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:53,583
[grunting]

1000
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:59,656
Oh, come now! You people just don't know when to quit!

1001
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:04,160
[gasping]

1002
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:07,397
Playing hide and seek? Well, you can't capture me if you keep running away.

1003
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:09,766
Oh, shut up! This isn't over, old man!

1004
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:13,703
That's right. You're gonna pay for what you did to Fire Emblem.

1005
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:16,473
Well, now, there's some kind of misunderstanding here.

1006
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:21,611
All I did for your friend was bring forth the trauma that he needs to overcome.

1007
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:23,513
Wha--?

1008
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:27,717
And the bottom line, in case you haven't figured it out, is this: The only way to awaken him is to

1009
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:31,254
defeat me! Now stop running away!

1010
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:32,489
Ha!!

1011
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:34,691
[groaning]

1012
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:38,528
[panting] I can't stand it anymore! Help me!

1013
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:43,867
Nobody's coming to help you, but that's not unusual. You're used to being alone.

1014
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,068
[sobbing]

1015
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:48,638
Face the fact. You brought all of this on yourself.

1016
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:50,373
Papa?!

1017
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:53,943
We tried our best and raised you with all our love, but then in the end, you betrayed us.

1018
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:55,278
Mama?!

1019
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:58,948
Be honest, deep down inside, aren't you really ashamed of yourself?

1020
00:56:58,982 --> 00:56:59,716
[gasping]

1021
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:02,552
The obvious solution is to die.

1022
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:09,325
[screaming and groaning]

1023
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:12,362
The flames keep getting stronger! Damn!

1024
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:17,233
It appears our Heroes are being toyed with. They're still unable to capture the criminals!

1025
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:21,771
I've gotta hand it to them. These guys are putting on quite a show.

1026
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:22,906
What is it?

1027
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:26,709
I'm telling you, something just doesn't feel right.

1028
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:28,378
Huh?

1029
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:31,481
It's like the suspects are purposely allowing the Heroes to catch up to them.

1030
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:33,950
What? Why would they do something like that?

1031
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:39,956
Here's a thought. Maybe they're using themselves as decoys in order to keep our Heroes busy.

1032
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:40,757
Yeah!

1033
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,859
Wait a minute! You're telling me...

1034
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:48,765
...These guys aren't just trying to recreate the legend? I doubt that.

1035
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,767
I'll inform Agnes, just to be safe.

1036
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,169
Good idea. I'll notify the police.

1037
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:57,507
All right, but as long as they make it interesting, who cares?

1038
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:09,986
[gasping and panicking]

1039
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,989
What the hell?!

1040
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:14,290
Who are you?!

1041
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:19,028
Virgil! Ben!

1042
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:25,935
[screaming]

1043
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:29,572
Somebody! Help me!

1044
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:31,674
Do something!

1045
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:35,144
[panicking] Ahh!

1046
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:38,748
Ah!

1047
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:44,320
Huh? Now what does he want?

1048
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,855
Can I help you with something?

1049
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:49,392
Agnes! You've got to send a Hero over here, immediately!

1050
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:50,293
Excuse me?

1051
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:51,394
There's an attack going on!

1052
00:58:51,427 --> 00:58:53,229
Who's being attacked?

1053
00:58:53,263 --> 00:58:57,800
They're after me! Apparently, I'm the one they were targeting this whole time!

1054
00:58:57,834 --> 00:58:59,235
What are you talking about?

1055
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:02,205
I don't have time to explain! Just do as I tell you!

1056
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:05,541
I can fire you from the show anytime I want, you know!

1057
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:06,910
Right away, sir!

1058
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:09,812
[howling]

1059
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:11,247
Mr. Schneider's under attack?!

1060
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:13,383
Yes! I need you to head over there immediately!

1061
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:16,920
Given the situation, I don't think we can really leave just---

1062
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:18,021
[grunting]

1063
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:20,990
There's no way we can leave either! [grunting]

1064
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,729
Take care of this, Ryan!

1065
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:29,866
What are you talking about?! Where are you going?!

1066
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:32,402
You heard what's going on! Mr. Schneider's in trouble!

1067
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:36,572
Then I'll go! It's a chance to make a name for myself!

1068
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:39,976
Excuse me, boys, but I prefer you to stick around.

1069
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:49,285
Huh?

1070
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:53,957
If either of you leaves... I'll be forced to do something to hurt the citizens.

1071
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:54,657
Huh--

1072
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:55,858
[yelling]

1073
00:59:57,961 --> 01:00:01,264
I wonder... Is it possible you're really after our boss!?

1074
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:04,734
What's going on?! Why isn't anybody here yet?!

1075
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,870
Uh-- I'm doing my best to round somebody up, sir.

1076
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:10,640
Well that's not cutting it, is it! Do whatever it takes!

1077
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:12,809
If that's the case, I do have an idea...

1078
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:17,213
Anything, you hear me! Anything at all! Just hurry, I'm running out of time, here!

1079
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:19,983
Ah, Mr. Schneider--

1080
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:23,753
Uh-- [sighing]

1081
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:27,790
[screaming]

1082
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:30,927
[grunting]

1083
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:34,998
Huh?

1084
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:36,733
Hello, Tiger...?

1085
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:40,803
The Justice Bureau gave us the go. For today, you're back to being a Second League Hero!

1086
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:42,472
What?! Why the sudden change?!

1087
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:46,275
Well, the new owner gave me the okay to handle everything myself.

1088
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,710
Are you serious?!

1089
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:51,047
If you put on a good show, you might be reinstated to the Second League!

1090
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,317
That sounds great. But I kinda have my hands full here...

1091
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:56,886
How 'bout you let us take care of things for ya?

1092
01:00:56,919 --> 01:00:58,454
Uh!

1093
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,823
Mr. Tiger. Show us what you need done and we'll take over.

1094
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:03,192
We're here for whatever you need!

1095
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:06,662
Keep the flames down.

1096
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:08,898
Yes, sir!

1097
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:12,268
You say a lot of things, boss. But in the end, you trust Tiger, don't you?

1098
01:01:12,301 --> 01:01:15,805
Hey! The Second League was a project I put together!

1099
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,674
I'm not gonna let it get squashed because of some idiot!

1100
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:19,475
[shrugging]

1101
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:23,179
[horn honking]

1102
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:25,181
There you are!

1103
01:01:25,214 --> 01:01:26,716
Huh?

1104
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:28,751
Hurry up and get on-board, Tiger!

1105
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:30,186
Mister Saito!

1106
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:53,910
All right! Time for a Wild Roar!

1107
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:58,881
Listen up everybody. As of now, I've reinstated Tiger for one day only!

1108
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:01,050
If you don't want him stealing most of the glory...

1109
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:03,786
Make sure you cover every target in front of you.

1110
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:04,854
Got that?!

1111
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:07,323
Absolutely! And it's about time, Kotetsu!

1112
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:08,524
Welcome back!

1113
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:09,926
All right! Good to have you!

1114
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:13,329
Just try not to get in my way, though. You hear me, Tiger?

1115
01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:14,864
Loud and clear!

1116
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:19,135
[gasping] That must be what I'm looking for!

1117
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:22,004
Put me down!

1118
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:25,641
Is it money? If it's money, I'll get you as much as you want!

1119
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:27,043
Go!

1120
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:32,915
Hey! Over here!

1121
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:35,985
Get me out of this thing! Hurry!

1122
01:02:37,386 --> 01:02:43,292
[struggling]

1123
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:53,169
[struggling]

1124
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:56,038
What do they think that old man's gonna be able to do?!

1125
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:59,575
[howling]

1126
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:03,679
Okay, boys. I think it's about time for your knock-out!

1127
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:05,248
Don't be ridiculous!

1128
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,216
Huh?

1129
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:11,854
Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Tiger would laugh at us if he heard we let a bastard like you win!

1130
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:14,257
[growling]

1131
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:17,627
[grunting]

1132
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:22,165
We can't lie around when that old man Hero is back with us, trying to do his best!

1133
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:23,666
Good point!

1134
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:28,504
Come on, now. Why don't you people lie down and go to sleep already?

1135
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:34,610
You know what I mean. Like that cowardly colleague of yours, who's neither guy nor girl.

1136
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:38,181
What did you just say?

1137
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:39,315
You queer!

1138
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:42,084
Ungrateful child!

1139
01:03:42,118 --> 01:03:44,854
Stop! Is what I am so wrong?!

1140
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:49,392
I can't take it! No more!

1141
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:54,964
You don't know... anything about him.

1142
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:57,934
Never talk like that about Fire!

1143
01:03:57,967 --> 01:04:05,174
I've never met another person like Fire Emblem! He's strong like a man, but gentle like a woman!

1144
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:08,778
There isn't a more wonderful person on this earth than him!

1145
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:10,012
[gasping]

1146
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:14,650
He's loyal and true! He deserves our respect!

1147
01:04:18,321 --> 01:04:25,127
I really am such a fool. Why the hell am I worried about all this now?

1148
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:29,799
Okay people, that's enough! Show's over! I have to accept reality!

1149
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:33,269
After all, this is who I am.

1150
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:37,139
The truth is, I'm quite happy I was born me.

1151
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:44,981
It's fine this way. I am who I am!

1152
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,484
[grunting]

1153
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:53,189
[giggling] A big man covered in bruises. I like it.

1154
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:56,092
Hey! Why won't you use your powers?!

1155
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:58,961
I can't do anything when I don't know which one's the real one!

1156
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:02,932
All we can do now is figure a way out of this, while avoiding her attacks.

1157
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:05,835
All right, on my signal... Take shelter over there.

1158
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:07,169
What?

1159
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:09,805
Just this once, listen to your partner, for a change.

1160
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:10,840
[grunting]

1161
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:13,009
Go!

1162
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:19,215
What's this?! Is Barnaby following Origami Cyclone, and leaving the scene as well?!

1163
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:23,419
Oh no, you don't! I said I wouldn't let you get away!

1164
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:30,660
Now then... Do-Don!

1165
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:34,363
Activating your powers from there won't do you any good!

1166
01:05:35,031 --> 01:05:36,432
Do-do-do-do-do!

1167
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:37,733
[cackling]

1168
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:38,734
Do-do-do-do-do!

1169
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:41,737
[cackling]

1170
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:44,540
Do-do-do-do-do!

1171
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:49,912
[gasping]

1172
01:05:49,945 --> 01:05:56,619
What's happening down there? Apparently, Ryan has extended his gravitational field!

1173
01:05:56,652 --> 01:06:00,956
Make it fast, Junior! I can't hold this forever!

1174
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:04,260
[groaning and gasping]

1175
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:14,370
They've done it! After a hard-fought battle, Ryan and Barnaby have apprehended the suspect!

1176
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:16,906
Hyyah!

1177
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:18,474
[grunting]

1178
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:26,882
Man, what a letdown. Looks like the King of Heroes is just a name.

1179
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:29,585
[grunting]

1180
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:31,287
[chuckling]

1181
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:33,589
[grunting]

1182
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:35,291
Leave my friends alone!

1183
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:39,028
I don't believe it! Origami Cyclone has returned!

1184
01:06:39,061 --> 01:06:39,995
Origami...!

1185
01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:41,464
You came back!

1186
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:44,100
Of course! I would never run away and leave my friends behind!

1187
01:06:44,133 --> 01:06:50,473
Yeah, let's hear it for the big Hero. But what do you think you're gonna be able to do? Huh?

1188
01:06:50,506 --> 01:07:00,916
[howling]

[groaning]

1191
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:08,190
What just happened?

1192
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:10,893
I don't know, but it worked!

1193
01:07:10,926 --> 01:07:14,296
Hey, blast me towards that guy!

1194
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:16,532
What? What are you thinking?!

1195
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:19,168
Please, just do it!

1196
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:25,307
Sky High!

1197
01:07:27,576 --> 01:07:30,379
[yelling]

1198
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:32,148
[groaning]

1199
01:07:36,051 --> 01:07:42,958
Rock Bison, who's had no opportunity to shine all season, has finally done so!

1200
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:44,927
[cheering]

1201
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,496

[grunting]

1204
01:07:58,374 --> 01:08:02,144
Haven't you learned yet, little girl? That won't work!

1205
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:05,214
[grunting]

1206
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:12,488
Oh no! The suspect is closing in on Dragon Kid!

1207
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:18,894
I will start by putting you to sleep, first. Sweet dreams, little girl.

1208
01:08:22,164 --> 01:08:24,500
[grunting]

1209
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:33,442
Sorry to keep you waiting!

1210
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:35,144
Huh?!

1211
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:37,480
Unbelievable! It's Fire Emblem!

1212
01:08:37,513 --> 01:08:39,315
[cheering]

1213
01:08:39,348 --> 01:08:42,051
Fire Emblem. Am I glad to see you!

1214
01:08:42,084 --> 01:08:43,986
You had us worried for a while.

1215
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:50,159
We'll do the emotional reunion later. For now, what do you say we put this old fart away?

1216
01:08:50,192 --> 01:08:51,727
[growling]

1217
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:52,328
Look out!

1218
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:54,463
Do your worst, old man.

1219
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:55,664
[gasping]

1220
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:59,134
You no longer hold any power over me; I'm proud of who I am!

1221
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:00,636
[gasping]

1222
01:09:00,669 --> 01:09:03,405
Fiiiiiire!

1223
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:13,549
They say a man is made of courage and a woman is made of love!

1224
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:16,218
So what does that mean for people who are gay?

1225
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:17,653
[quiet gasping]

1226
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:20,289
We are invincible!

1227
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:26,529
Way to go, Fire!

1228
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:30,566
[yelling]

[gasping]

01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:38,073
Looks like it might have been too soon for him to re-join the fight!

01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:39,642
[yelling]

[grunting and groaning]

1237
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:01,697
Enough!

1238
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:13,075
Arrrrghhh!

1239
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:14,843
Wait a minute...! Did I just...?

1240

[screaming]

1242
01:10:25,621 --> 01:10:27,489
Curse you!

1243
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:31,393
Your crime's been... put on hold!

1244
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:39,802
[struggling]

1245
01:10:41,203 --> 01:10:44,740
[sighing]

1246
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:50,779
They've done it! Fire Emblem has returned and, combining their powers, the three Heroes have

1247
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:53,515
brought down the suspect!

1248
01:10:55,884 --> 01:10:58,787
[panicking]

1249
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:07,529

[screaming]

1251
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:19,408
That was too close for comfort.

1252
01:11:24,513 --> 01:11:26,715
[gasping] Bunny!

1253
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:33,355
Ahhh! Oh, that hurt.

1254
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:36,592
What are you doing? Let me guess. You mis-timed activating your powers again, didn't you?

1255
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:40,095
I haven't used them yet! Especially after what you told me.

1256
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:40,996
[gasping]

1257
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:43,799
Oh boy, now my hands are numb.

1258
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:50,139
Hm.

1259
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:54,743
Hey, I hate to interrupt this moment, but our prey is getting away! Can we focus here, people?

1260
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:56,712
Right.

1261
01:11:58,681 --> 01:11:59,548
Huh?

1262
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:00,349
What?

1263
01:12:00,382 --> 01:12:03,118
I can see them. I can see them now!

1264
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,325
Oh god! Why is he there?

1265
01:12:09,358 --> 01:12:11,460
That's... Lunatic!

1266
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:15,564
Just as our cameras finally caught sight of Barnaby and the others, Lunatic suddenly

1267
01:12:15,597 --> 01:12:21,036
appeared! This is a startling development! Lunatic only pursues murderers! We have no

1268
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:23,739
idea why he would be here at this particular moment!

1269
01:12:23,772 --> 01:12:26,375
I'm tellin' ya, that dude gives me the creeps.

1270
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:28,744
You two go after that mechanical monster!

1271
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:31,880
Kotetsu!

1272
01:12:33,782 --> 01:12:37,986
I'll look after this guy! Time for an explanation, pal!

1273
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:39,021
Uh!

1274
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:40,622
Okay, let's go!

1275
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:45,728
Hello?! Fine, suit yourself.

1276
01:12:57,506 --> 01:13:01,610
Get going, Bunny! What good is a team if you're not workin' together?!

1277
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:02,177
But--

1278
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:03,512
Just go!

1279
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:11,854
Be gone! I have no business with you!

1280
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:16,525
Our boss is being held captive by that machine. The last thing we need is for you to butt in.

1281
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:18,127
Now, get the hell out of here!

1282
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,864
Such a fool. You can't even see what the true evil is.

1283
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:22,631
Huh?

1284
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:27,069
Thanatos always speaks the truth.

1285
01:13:27,102 --> 01:13:30,873
The question is... can Wild Tiger stop Lunatic on his own?

1286
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:32,441
Come on, Dad...

1287
01:13:32,474 --> 01:13:34,910
Huh? Hey, what's that up there?

1288
01:13:40,616 --> 01:13:43,218
What the hell... do you plan to do with me?!

1289
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:53,462
[panicking]

1290
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:56,965
[groaning]

1291
01:13:57,332 --> 01:13:59,468
[yelping]

1292
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:01,837
Hear me, citizens of Stern Bild...!

1293
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:08,443
Tonight, I shall re-enact the justice that was demonstrated by the legendary Goddess! As a

1294
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:15,050
warning to you all, let the death of this man be burned into your memories!

1295
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:18,854
[screaming]

1296
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:28,697
[yelling]

1297
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:32,634
[screaming]

1298
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:33,735
Ryan!

1299
01:14:36,705 --> 01:14:39,908
Don't bother telling me what to do! [grunting]

1300
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:51,587
Oh yeah. Am I good or what?

1301
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:57,326
They've done it! Ryan and Barnaby take down an enemy for the second time today!

1302
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:03,532
Kinda pathetic... What is this machine, anyway? Is this supposed to be the Goddess?

1303
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:07,903
Don't touch that!

1304
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:10,439
Uh! What is the meaning of this?!

1305
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:16,411
Well, isn't this a surprise. So you're the one who's been pulling the strings, huh, Virgil?

1306
01:15:16,445 --> 01:15:18,380
Are you all right? Hey!

1307
01:15:18,413 --> 01:15:19,848
[grunting]

1308
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:24,052
I... think so. Do you have any idea what happened?

1309
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:27,022
That bastard...!

1310
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:29,424
My name's Andrew.

1311
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:30,392
What?

1312
01:15:30,425 --> 01:15:34,029
Andrew Scott.. That's my real name.

1313
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:36,798
Wait a minute...

1314
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:39,935
Does the name 'Scott System' ring a bell with anybody?

1315
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:40,702
Huh?

1316
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:42,704
I'm not surprised.

1317
01:15:42,738 --> 01:15:46,708
My father founded it... and it was very small.

1318
01:15:49,077 --> 01:15:57,753
He was a good father. He raised me as a single parent. And no matter how busy he was, he never complained.

1319
01:15:57,786 --> 01:16:04,493
He was a hard worker, and despite the challenges, he managed to keep the company going. Even as a

1320
01:16:04,526 --> 01:16:06,228
young child, I could understand that.

1321
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:10,732
That's why, when a man showed up saying he'd help my father's business, I was

1322
01:16:10,766 --> 01:16:14,970
overjoyed. That man was Mark Schneider.

1323
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:19,408
The company grew almost instantly. Schneider was our savior.

1324
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:23,979
I knew in my heart I would be indebted to him... my entire life.

1325
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:26,448
... Until my father committed suicide.

1326
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:27,583
[gasping]

1327
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:30,419
One thing I knew for sure. My father was not

1328
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:35,891
the kind of person who would take his own life. And so, like a man possessed, I searched for

1329
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,260
the truth behind his death.

1330
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:41,697
And then I finally discovered what had really happened!

1331
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:46,435
I found out my father had been forced to sell his company after being tricked by that monster!

1332
01:16:46,468 --> 01:16:51,540
Mark Schneider had used my father's company to hide his illegal investments!

1333
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:55,711
I planned to expose everything, and bring the hammer down on him.

1334
01:16:55,744 --> 01:17:01,483
For that one purpose, I infiltrated his company, and spent years there, digging up the truth!

1335
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:03,719
And then the moment arrived.

1336
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:08,924
Security was going to be under-manned on the day of the festival.

1337
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:12,027
All that was left was to keep you Heroes occupied.

1338
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,796
So that's why you used the legend of the Goddess.

1339
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:16,732
That's not the only reason.

1340
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:22,504
I wanted to show the world what happens to people who lose sight of what is true and just!

1341
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:25,807
I understand what you're saying. Is that why you hired those NEXTS?

1342
01:17:25,841 --> 01:17:27,809
What do you mean 'hired'?

1343
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:33,949
We're all comrades who swore revenge on Schneider.

1344
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:36,051
All of us were victims of his greed!

1345
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:38,954
[gasping]

1346
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:41,056
You know how we feel, don't you?

1347
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:41,957
Uh!

1348
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:45,160
You became a Hero to exact revenge as well.

1349
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:46,128
Uh--

1350
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:47,929
I'm so close...

1351
01:17:47,963 --> 01:17:51,333
...So close to getting justice for my father.

1352
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:55,470
Knowing all that... Do you still intend to stop me?!

1353
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:59,674
So you're telling me you came to help them get even?!

1354
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:05,514
Protecting evildoers is a grave crime of its own. Justice must be done.

1355
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:08,784
We're talking revenge here! That's not necessarily justice!

1356
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:14,589
You reject the idea of killing because it goes against your principles. But didn't your partner

1357
01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:17,559
find peace his parents' killer met his end?

1358
01:18:17,592 --> 01:18:21,530
Yes, you're right. There was a time when I sought revenge.

1359
01:18:21,563 --> 01:18:27,002
I thought.. it would give me the future that I lost when my parents were taken away from me.

1360
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:31,373
I don't understand. Why are you willing to save this man's life?

1361
01:18:31,406 --> 01:18:36,111
I'm not worried about him. I'm here for you!

1362
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:39,548
Bunny is still dealing with that pain to this very day!

1363
01:18:39,581 --> 01:18:44,019
He's trying to move forward by accepting everything that's happened in the past!

1364
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:47,856
You prevail by shaping the present... Kotetsu taught me that.

1365
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:54,629
He stopped me from taking the wrong path. It's because of him that I'm here today.

1366
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:56,665
I am not going to let Schneider live.

1367
01:18:56,698 --> 01:19:01,169
In that case.. I'll have to stop you, no matter what it takes!

1368
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:05,307
That's too bad.

1369
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:14,449
I've misjudged you. I thought you were a champion of justice.

1370
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:19,254
I am! But I want nothing to do with a justice that allows people to kill!

1371
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:20,021
Fine.

1372
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:21,289
[gasping]

1373
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:26,394
So be it. I shall crush evil along with your spineless justice,

1374
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:28,396
right here and now.

1375
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:46,414
That's a cool ability! But it's no match for mine!

1376
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:50,018
Here it comes...! Do-don!

1377
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:56,158
Barnaby!

1378
01:19:56,691 --> 01:19:58,994
[grunting]

1379
01:19:59,027 --> 01:20:04,299
Ryan attacks, while Barnaby protects! Their teamwork shines through once again!

1380
01:20:07,335 --> 01:20:09,237
Ahhhhhh!

1381
01:20:12,841 --> 01:20:14,976
[screaming]

1382
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:24,452
That dude is stealing my spotlight again. Huh?!

1383
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:26,922
Oh, shit!

1384
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:30,725
[confused murmuring]

1385
01:20:30,759 --> 01:20:31,793
What's happening?!

1386
01:20:31,826 --> 01:20:34,095
We lost... the chopper with the camera!

1387
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:34,930
[gasping]

1388
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:39,367
[gasping] Ryan!

1389
01:20:43,271 --> 01:20:47,275
Last warning! Get out of my way, Barnaby!

1390
01:20:52,914 --> 01:20:54,950
[grunting]

1391
01:20:57,185 --> 01:21:00,255
An eviscerated justice serves no-one!

1392
01:21:00,288 --> 01:21:04,559
Annihilating evil is the only way to escape the curse of our past!

1393
01:21:04,593 --> 01:21:08,029
Bunny's dealing with his past without destroying anything!

1394
01:21:10,298 --> 01:21:11,766
How long before we're back?!

1395
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:12,901
Almost there!

1396
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:16,304
Hm? What's this?!

1397
01:21:20,308 --> 01:21:24,012
At some point, you're gonna have to face the truth...!

1398
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:31,486
...What you're doing won't work! It won't solve anything!

1399
01:21:31,519 --> 01:21:33,822
Shut up!

1400
01:21:33,855 --> 01:21:38,927
Even if you succeed with your revenge, it won't bring your father back! That's the reality!

1401
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:58,146
[grunting]

1402
01:21:58,179 --> 01:21:59,147
Huh?

1403
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:03,051
[yelling]

1404
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:06,721
Huh? Uh?!

1405
01:22:08,857 --> 01:22:12,227
Huh? Here you go! Thanks! Have a nice--

1406
01:22:15,797 --> 01:22:22,370
The justice you uphold is artificial! In the end, all it does is allow you to ignore true evil! And

1407
01:22:22,404 --> 01:22:25,340
that raises the question of what good you are as a Hero!

1408
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:29,044
This may come as a shock, but I don't evaluate myself that way!

1409
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:33,915
What can a Hero like you, who won't bring evil to justice, possibly accomplish?!

1410
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:38,219
If someone needs help, I'm there for them! I know that's hard for you to process, but it's

1411
01:22:38,253 --> 01:22:40,355
really as simple as that!

1412
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:51,232
[grunting]

1413
01:22:53,601 --> 01:22:55,103
Give it up, Barnaby!

1414
01:22:55,503 --> 01:22:56,604
[grunting]

1415
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:03,078
Ahhh!

1416
01:23:03,111 --> 01:23:08,583
Forgive me, ladies and gentlemen. This situation has left me completely speechless.

1417
01:23:08,616 --> 01:23:13,955
[struggling]

1418
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:19,327
Oh no you don't. I'll never let you go off and harm anyone...

1419
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:20,528
Never!

1420
01:23:26,434 --> 01:23:29,571
Time to end this little game, Barnaby.

1421
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:37,645
[screaming]

1422
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,848
Fine.

1423
01:23:39,881 --> 01:23:45,653
If that's how you want it... I'll watch as you plummet to the ground in defeat!

1424
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:48,556
Help me Barnaby, please!

1425
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:54,629
I will return this man to a state of nothingness.

1426
01:23:54,662 --> 01:23:55,897
[grunting]

1427
01:23:55,930 --> 01:24:01,536
[yelling]

1428
01:24:03,471 --> 01:24:04,506
Owww.

1429
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:05,907
Kotetsu!

1430
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:10,078
Bunny! But that means...

1431
01:24:10,111 --> 01:24:11,379
You're in my way!

1432
01:24:11,413 --> 01:24:12,547
[screaming]

1433
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:16,584
[grunting]

1434
01:24:16,618 --> 01:24:19,888
Ahhhhhhh!

1435
01:24:19,921 --> 01:24:27,662
What the hell are you doing? Did you come here intending to save Schneider?

1436
01:24:27,695 --> 01:24:27,729
Yeah, well, sort of.

1437
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:31,199
You can't do it on your own.

1438
01:24:31,232 --> 01:24:33,468
All right, so give me a hand!

1439
01:24:36,137 --> 01:24:39,908
That is exactly what I was planning to do!

1440
01:24:39,941 --> 01:24:44,879
What's this? It looks like Wild Tiger and Barnaby are...

1441
01:24:50,618 --> 01:24:53,455
[grunting]

1442
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:03,731
[grunting]

1443
01:25:09,471 --> 01:25:10,472
[grunting]

1444
01:25:14,175 --> 01:25:16,177
Those legs are really nasty!

1445
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:18,646
The only thing we can do is keep attacking!

1446
01:25:22,183 --> 01:25:24,219
[yelling]

1447
01:25:26,654 --> 01:25:28,490
Arh!

1448
01:25:29,757 --> 01:25:31,226
Kotetsu!

1449
01:25:35,196 --> 01:25:37,665
[grunting]

1450
01:25:43,705 --> 01:25:48,576

1451
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:53,181
Kotetsu!

1452
01:25:56,184 --> 01:25:58,653
Bunny! How are your powers?!

1453
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:00,421
I'm still re-charging!

1454
01:26:00,455 --> 01:26:02,590
Guess I have no choice.

1455
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:05,793
Goodbye.

1456
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:06,561
[gasping]

1457
01:26:10,064 --> 01:26:11,566
[gasping]

1458
01:26:12,734 --> 01:26:17,438
[growling]

1459
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:20,275
Impossible!

1460
01:26:21,809 --> 01:26:23,745
[yelling]

1461
01:26:31,419 --> 01:26:32,720
Ha!!!!

1462
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:36,824
[yelling]

1463
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:38,560
Don't interfere!

1464
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:41,596
Fire!

1465
01:26:45,099 --> 01:26:47,335
[growling]

1466
01:26:56,578 --> 01:26:57,345
[gasping]

1467
01:26:57,378 --> 01:27:01,149
It's time for you to stay down!

1468
01:27:01,182 --> 01:27:05,720
We've been waiting for this! The Heroes have finally assembled!

1469
01:27:05,753 --> 01:27:08,323
Damn you all!

1470
01:27:09,157 --> 01:27:10,592
Bunny! How much longer?!

1471
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:11,226
[grunting]

1472
01:27:11,259 --> 01:27:12,560
Now or never!

1473
01:27:12,594 --> 01:27:13,828
Mr. Barnaby!

1474
01:27:13,861 --> 01:27:14,762
Do it fast!

1475
01:27:14,796 --> 01:27:16,097
Mr. Wild!

1476
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:17,465
Tiger!

1477
01:27:17,498 --> 01:27:18,166
Come on!

1478
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:19,400
How 'bout now?!

1479
01:27:20,635 --> 01:27:21,836
Almost...

1480
01:27:21,869 --> 01:27:24,505
[grunting]

1481
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:27,508
[gasping]

1482
01:27:29,777 --> 01:27:31,512
Do-Dodon!!

1483
01:27:32,146 --> 01:27:33,248
[gasping]

1484
01:27:33,281 --> 01:27:34,849
Kiss my boots!

1485
01:27:34,882 --> 01:27:36,284
I'm back!

1486
01:27:36,317 --> 01:27:39,520
The Gravity Prince has returned to the game!

1487
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:41,856
Kotetsu!

1488
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:44,592
All right! Let's do this!

1489
01:27:44,626 --> 01:27:45,426
Yeah!

1490
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:58,539
He's all yours.

1491
01:28:04,812 --> 01:28:07,649
[yelling]

1492
01:28:31,406 --> 01:28:35,410
[grunting]

1493
01:28:36,511 --> 01:28:39,180
Powers expire in ten seconds.

1494
01:28:39,213 --> 01:28:39,847
Bunny!

1495
01:28:39,881 --> 01:28:41,549
I know, I'm on it!

1496
01:28:49,824 --> 01:28:52,960
[grunting]

1497
01:28:53,861 --> 01:28:55,763
[yelling]

1498
01:28:55,797 --> 01:28:59,467
Tiger and Barnaby over and out.

1499
01:29:19,787 --> 01:29:23,858
[panting]

1500
01:29:38,306 --> 01:29:40,274
[gasping]

1501
01:29:40,308 --> 01:29:42,744
Uh!

1502
01:29:44,746 --> 01:29:45,413
Nu-uh.

1503
01:29:45,446 --> 01:29:49,016
Uh! [confused groaning]

1504
01:29:52,019 --> 01:29:53,020
[giggling]

1505
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:55,656
Huh? [chuckling]

1506
01:29:59,827 --> 01:30:02,230
Well, we sure made a huge mess again.

1507
01:30:02,263 --> 01:30:05,333
Yeah, this time I really thought I was a goner.

1508
01:30:05,366 --> 01:30:08,402
Is that what you think about when you're out there fighting?

1509
01:30:08,436 --> 01:30:09,670
What?

1510
01:30:09,704 --> 01:30:11,539
He's right, you know. You're so negative, Origami!

1511
01:30:11,572 --> 01:30:16,344
So what if he's like that? I mean, it's part of what makes him who he is.

1512
01:30:16,377 --> 01:30:21,582
A part of who he is. This makes more sense to me, now. So it's okay to be myself!

1513
01:30:21,616 --> 01:30:23,317
That takes a big load off!

1514
01:30:23,351 --> 01:30:24,685
Hm? What are you talking about?

1515
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:26,554
Uh, it's nothing, really.

1516
01:30:26,587 --> 01:30:29,724
You are so weird. [chuckling]

1517
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:33,528
There you are! What you people did today was truly mind-blowing!

1518
01:30:33,561 --> 01:30:38,099
You really are the protectors of this city! And that teamwork between Tiger and Barnaby! It was

1519
01:30:38,132 --> 01:30:40,334
just like the good old days, don't you agree?!

1520
01:30:40,368 --> 01:30:42,570
I wouldn't say team, right?

1521
01:30:42,603 --> 01:30:44,138
That's stretching it.

1522
01:30:44,172 --> 01:30:47,041
Oh come on, now! Don't be so modest! You were perfect together!

1523
01:30:47,074 --> 01:30:51,312
Hey, I know! Why don't you three guys form a trio?!

1524
01:30:51,345 --> 01:30:52,647
Uh--?!

1525
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:56,050
Ryan and Barnaby, with Tiger! Or maybe, featuring Tiger!

1526
01:30:56,083 --> 01:30:56,851
I'm sorry, but--

1527
01:30:56,884 --> 01:30:59,821
Come on! He's got a point!

1528
01:30:59,854 --> 01:31:00,988
Huh?

1529
01:31:01,022 --> 01:31:01,489
What?

1530
01:31:01,522 --> 01:31:04,692
Camera... Over here.

1531
01:31:04,725 --> 01:31:09,530
Really, it's so obvious! I knew it from the moment they started working together again!

1532
01:31:09,564 --> 01:31:11,799
These guys were made for each other!

1533
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:13,000
Huh?

1534
01:31:13,034 --> 01:31:15,636
That's why I arranged to televise this feel-good comeback!

1535
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:18,272
Zoom in here. It was a lot of work...

1536
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:21,843
...But I made you guys look good! You can thank me later!

1537
01:31:21,876 --> 01:31:22,476
Huh?

1538
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:24,445
Listen, guys--

1539
01:31:24,478 --> 01:31:28,516
Be smart and take some advice from the Great Ryan. You're the only partners for each other!

1540
01:31:28,549 --> 01:31:29,851
It was meant to be!

1541
01:31:29,884 --> 01:31:30,852
Hm.

1542
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:32,486
Uh--

1543
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:35,089
What's it gonna be? Are you reuniting?

1544
01:31:35,122 --> 01:31:38,526
That depends. We don't get to decide that on our own.

1545
01:31:38,559 --> 01:31:39,994
Well, I approve it!

1546
01:31:40,027 --> 01:31:41,028
Hm?

1547
01:31:41,062 --> 01:31:45,166
Hello there, everybody! Earlier I, Agnes Joubert,

1548
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:49,971
was granted full authority to run this operation by our owner, Mr. Mark Schneider.

1549
01:31:50,004 --> 01:31:51,839
Huh?

1550
01:31:51,873 --> 01:31:54,542
Anyway... Since our owner is currently disabled...

1551
01:31:54,575 --> 01:31:58,045
I will approve... the reinstatement of these Heroes!

1552
01:31:58,079 --> 01:31:59,714
[cheering]

1553
01:31:59,747 --> 01:32:01,449
Now wait a minute! Hold on there!

1554
01:32:01,482 --> 01:32:03,451
Not yet ready to make the big decision?

1555
01:32:03,484 --> 01:32:09,390
Well, no, it's just that... I'm a changed man these days. And besides...

1556
01:32:09,423 --> 01:32:11,659
My power only lasts for a minute.

1557
01:32:11,692 --> 01:32:13,060
Come on, Tiger.

1558
01:32:13,094 --> 01:32:14,428
[exhaling]

1559
01:32:14,462 --> 01:32:16,030
Mm.

1560
01:32:16,764 --> 01:32:17,498
Uh--

1561
01:32:17,531 --> 01:32:19,734
That doesn't matter, Tiger!

1562
01:32:19,767 --> 01:32:20,935
Huh?

1563
01:32:23,704 --> 01:32:28,609
You'll always be a hero! When people need help, they know they can count on you!

1564
01:32:28,643 --> 01:32:31,879
Right, mom? We both think you're the coolest Hero!

1565
01:32:31,913 --> 01:32:33,214
[gasping]

1566
01:32:33,247 --> 01:32:37,418
That's right! Just watching you on screen always cheers me up.

1567
01:32:37,451 --> 01:32:39,220
Who cares if you only last a minute?!

1568
01:32:39,253 --> 01:32:41,622
We like to see you giving everything you've got!

1569
01:32:41,656 --> 01:32:43,691
[cheering]

1570
01:32:43,724 --> 01:32:45,893
Hang in there, Tiger! You're terrific!

1571
01:32:45,927 --> 01:32:48,429
You're our hero, Mr. Tiger!

1572
01:32:48,462 --> 01:32:56,737
[chanting] Tiger! Tiger! Tiger!

1573
01:32:56,771 --> 01:32:59,407
He really is an amazing personality.

1574
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:02,376
Listen to how he's touched the hearts of all those people.

1575
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:03,778
Mm-hmm.

1576
01:33:03,811 --> 01:33:06,047
Just listen to that! Everyone who's watching is behind you!

1577
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:08,683
[gasping] Hmm.

1578
01:33:09,483 --> 01:33:11,953
Are you okay with this?

1579
01:33:17,625 --> 01:33:20,294
How can we turn these people down?

1580
01:33:20,328 --> 01:33:25,032
It's okay with me. With you around.. ..it'll make me stand out.

1581
01:33:26,867 --> 01:33:27,735
Hm.

1582
01:33:30,538 --> 01:33:39,280
[cheering]

1583
01:33:39,313 --> 01:33:44,251
As of this very moment, Tiger and Barnaby are back together once again!

1584
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:54,128
[cheering]

1585
01:33:54,962 --> 01:33:57,098
You're next up, Kaburagi.

1586
01:33:57,131 --> 01:33:58,132
Yes, sir.

1587
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,836
'The Sun'.. By Kaede Kaburagi.

1588
01:34:01,869 --> 01:34:08,309
Did you know? There are other suns beyond the one that shines brightly in our sky. The tiger

1589
01:34:08,342 --> 01:34:14,382
that runs proudly. The bunny that hops about. The ice that glistens brilliantly. The wind

1590
01:34:14,415 --> 01:34:22,523
that blows briskly. The fire that burns intensely. The cow that moos loudly. The shadow

1591
01:34:22,556 --> 01:34:28,462
that changes suddenly. The lightning that flashes brightly. They're all different. But they

1592
01:34:28,496 --> 01:34:34,902
all have a sun burning inside of them. Sometimes they feel sad and hurt and down. But eventually

1593
01:34:34,935 --> 01:34:42,610
the sun will rise. Everyone's sun will rise. The sun always rises when you're down. The sun

1594
01:34:42,643 --> 01:34:50,184
rises, no matter what. Today and tomorrow, the sun is always rising.

1595
01:38:07,214 --> 01:38:11,085
A billionaire from overseas made me an offer to work for him.

1596
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:11,752
See?

1597
01:38:11,785 --> 01:38:13,554
That's a lot!

1598
01:38:13,587 --> 01:38:17,758
I thought about it, and I can't stay in this small-time joint anymore.

1599
01:38:17,791 --> 01:38:19,693
See ya around, boys!

1600
01:38:21,629 --> 01:38:25,532
I guess we'll have to survive without him somehow. Right?

1601
01:40:10,304 --> 01:40:12,940
Hey. How about I drive for a change?
