He's somehow
different from the rest.

Could he be a Super Saiyan?

01:20:42,375 --> 01:20:44,291
[GOHAN] But Sir! You have to
give me the Senzu Beans!

313
01:20:44,375 --> 01:20:46,375
They're for my Dad!

314
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:49,041
[GOHAN] I'm being rude,
aren't I? You're right!

315
01:20:49,125 --> 01:20:52,583
I should have brought a gift!
I'll be right back, Sir!

316
01:20:52,666 --> 01:20:56,291
[YAJIROBE] Hey! Wait up!
Don't leave without these!

317
01:20:56,375 --> 01:20:57,250
What's this?

318
01:20:57,333 --> 01:20:59,708
A bag of Senzu Beans, what else?

319
01:20:59,791 --> 01:21:00,833
Hey, what the...?

320
01:21:00,916 --> 01:21:03,541
I'm the bean daddy
this time! Bean Daddy!

321
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:07,291
Is that so? Well, who put you
in charge? They're my beans!

322
01:21:07,375 --> 01:21:09,541
[YAJIROBE]
I watered 'em!

323
01:21:09,625 --> 01:21:11,250
Here, Master Korin!
These are yours!

324
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:15,041
Huh? Oh, well, I guess you
do have pretty good manners.

325
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:16,250
I guess you can keep them!

326
01:21:16,333 --> 01:21:17,500
[YAJIROBE]
Stop messin' with him...!

327
01:21:17,583 --> 01:21:18,916
You were going to give
him the beans anyway!

328
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,750
Would you shut up!

329
01:21:20,833 --> 01:21:23,750
Thank you!
I really appreciate it, Sir!

330
01:21:23,833 --> 01:21:26,375
It was great seeing both
of you again! Take care!

331
01:21:26,458 --> 01:21:27,750
[KORIN]
See ya later, kid!

332
01:21:27,833 --> 01:21:29,625
[GOHAN]
Bye, bye! Thanks!

333
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:31,875
Hmm!

334
01:21:31,958 --> 01:21:34,541
Hey, Gohan, catch!

335
01:21:34,625 --> 01:21:35,958
What's this?

336
01:21:36,041 --> 01:21:38,791
Ahh! Another bean! Thanks!

337
01:21:38,875 --> 01:21:41,500
Why on Earth do I let
you live up here?

338
01:21:41,583 --> 01:21:44,083
I dunno. Beats
the heck out of me.

339
01:21:45,708 --> 01:21:46,916
See ya later!

340
01:21:51,125 --> 01:21:53,083
[GOHAN] Icarus!
I'm ready, boy!

341
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:58,000
We did it!

342
01:21:58,083 --> 01:22:00,541
Now, let's get these Senzu Beans
back to my Dad, on the double!

343
01:22:03,916 --> 01:22:08,625
Mmm! Pretty nice kid. Oh, and
by the way, what's a bean daddy?

344
01:22:08,708 --> 01:22:10,208
Uh, I don't know, but ah,

345
01:22:10,291 --> 01:22:13,041
anyway speaking of
beans let's make some chili.

346
01:22:14,458 --> 01:22:16,625
Keep it up, Icarus!
You're doing great!

347
01:22:18,208 --> 01:22:21,958
Huh? Wow! I can't believe
it's already morning!

348
01:22:22,041 --> 01:22:23,541
How are you doing Goku?

349
01:22:23,625 --> 01:22:26,083
Goku, wake up!

350
01:22:26,166 --> 01:22:27,791
Goku!

351
01:22:27,875 --> 01:22:31,750
Hey! What's all the
racket? I'm alive, okay?

352
01:22:32,458 --> 01:22:34,833
Oh, don't mind me!
Just checking!

353
01:22:34,916 --> 01:22:37,833
After all, there's no sense
in guarding a dead guy, right?

354
01:22:37,916 --> 01:22:39,208
That's right!

355
01:22:40,125 --> 01:22:43,041
Mmm! Man!

356
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:46,416
[KRILLIN THINKS] Your Dad
needs you, Gohan! Hurry!

357
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:49,083
[DOORE] This is ridiculous!
I think they're dead!

358
01:22:49,166 --> 01:22:51,291
[NEIZ] As if it
matters what he thinks...!

359
01:22:51,375 --> 01:22:53,583
What matters is
what Lord Cooler thinks!

360
01:22:55,125 --> 01:22:57,708
Come on, boy! Almost there!

361
01:23:00,916 --> 01:23:03,750
Oh, you've really
got it bad, don't you?

362
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:07,916
Hey, I know! Here!

363
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,333
Take this, boy!

364
01:23:16,333 --> 01:23:17,708
Whoa!

365
01:23:17,791 --> 01:23:19,416
[GOHAN CHUCKLES]

366
01:23:21,333 --> 01:23:23,958
That did the trick!
Good as new!

367
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:26,250
Got 'em!

368
01:23:26,833 --> 01:23:29,791
Betcha never thought you
could fly this fast, did you?

369
01:23:30,166 --> 01:23:31,416
[GOHAN LAUGHS]

370
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:34,166
[SALZA] So! Going
somewhere, monkey-boy?

371
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:38,000
Uh, oh! Icarus! Let's
get out of here, quick!

372
01:23:38,083 --> 01:23:39,375
[DOORE] Let
him have it, Salza!

373
01:23:39,458 --> 01:23:40,583
[DOORE LAUGHS]

374
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:45,708
[GOHAN YELLS]

375
01:23:48,958 --> 01:23:50,416
[GOHAN] It's okay!
I've got you!

376
01:23:54,375 --> 01:23:55,500
Icarus!

377
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:09,666
Hey... whatchya got in the
bag there monkey boy?

378
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:11,875
There... give it here.

379
01:24:11,958 --> 01:24:13,250
Give it!

380
01:24:14,125 --> 01:24:18,750
Alright... that's it.
You're going bye bye kid!

381
01:24:18,833 --> 01:24:22,208
I call this my
can opener attack.

382
01:24:24,791 --> 01:24:26,083
Doore!

383
01:24:26,916 --> 01:24:28,458
Who did that?

384
01:24:28,541 --> 01:24:30,708
[PICCOLO]
That would be me!

385
01:24:32,583 --> 01:24:34,083
A Namek? Out here?

386
01:24:34,166 --> 01:24:37,333
[DOORE] Why isn't that toad on
his own world where he belongs?

387
01:24:37,416 --> 01:24:38,833
[NEIZ]
Frieza blew it up!

388
01:24:38,916 --> 01:24:40,291
[DOORE]
Oh, yeah! Yeah.

389
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:42,833
Ah, yeah! Piccolo!

390
01:24:42,916 --> 01:24:46,500
[DOORE] It's all over for you,
Namek! You're going to die!

391
01:24:46,583 --> 01:24:48,958
[PICCOLO] Not likely!
I've seen you fight!

392
01:24:49,041 --> 01:24:51,125
I'm going to rip you apart!

393
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,458
[DOORE]
Where'd he go? Huh?

394
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:08,000
[PICCOLO] Gohan,
what are you doing?

395
01:25:08,083 --> 01:25:11,083
Get those beans
to your dad! And hurry!

396
01:25:11,625 --> 01:25:14,166
[GOHAN] Right!
We'll be right back!

397
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:16,416
Oh yeah! That's
what you think!

398
01:25:18,625 --> 01:25:19,916
Gohan!

399
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:26,125
Ha! You missed me!

400
01:25:28,291 --> 01:25:30,791
[SALZA] He was aiming for
Doore, you idiot!

401
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,791
[DOORE]
Move it.

402
01:25:51,083 --> 01:25:53,750
Darn it! I can't...

403
01:25:55,625 --> 01:25:58,583
[DOORE SCREAMS]

404
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,250
Doore!

405
01:26:02,333 --> 01:26:03,791
You're dead!

406
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:12,541
Have it!

407
01:26:14,333 --> 01:26:16,500
[SALZA]
Excellent, Neiz!

408
01:26:16,583 --> 01:26:19,500
[SALZA] Finish him off!
I'm going after the kid!

409
01:26:19,583 --> 01:26:20,208
Right!

410
01:26:20,291 --> 01:26:22,500
And Neiz make it hurt.

411
01:26:22,583 --> 01:26:27,000
Yes! I'll bet you're feeling
pretty stupid right about now!

412
01:26:27,083 --> 01:26:29,875
Deep fried Namek!
How yummy!

413
01:26:31,625 --> 01:26:33,583
[NEIZ SCREAMS]

414
01:26:42,458 --> 01:26:43,750
[SALZA]
What the?

415
01:26:44,791 --> 01:26:45,916
Neiz! I thought you--

416
01:26:59,833 --> 01:27:01,208
[SALZA]
No way!

417
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:08,250
[SALZA LAUGHS]

418
01:27:09,166 --> 01:27:11,208
[SALZA]
What the heck is that?

419
01:27:29,875 --> 01:27:32,166
[SALZA LAUGHS]

420
01:27:38,166 --> 01:27:40,125
[SALZA] The Party's
over, Namek!

421
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:44,791
[SALZA]
Who are you?

422
01:27:48,375 --> 01:27:52,208
My name is Piccolo! You should
never have come to this planet!

423
01:27:52,291 --> 01:27:55,083
[COOLER] Salza!
Leave him to me!

424
01:28:02,291 --> 01:28:05,541
[COOLER] Salza, what are you
waiting for? Go get the kid!

425
01:28:05,625 --> 01:28:07,083
[SALZA]
Yes, my lord!

426
01:28:08,166 --> 01:28:10,833
[PICCOLO] You're
supposed to be dead!

427
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:18,666
[KRILLIN] Gohan should've
been back by now!

428
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:19,708
Darn it!

429
01:28:19,791 --> 01:28:21,750
Goku! You've got to hang on!

430
01:28:22,625 --> 01:28:24,458
[GOHAN] Krillin!
Where are you?

431
01:28:24,541 --> 01:28:25,875
[KRILLIN]
In here!

432
01:28:26,583 --> 01:28:27,875
What in the world took so long?

433
01:28:27,958 --> 01:28:29,958
[GOHAN] We got shot down
by those three goons...!

434
01:28:30,041 --> 01:28:32,250
If it wasn't for Piccolo,
we wouldn't even have these...!

435
01:28:32,333 --> 01:28:33,333
There's enough for an army here!

436
01:28:33,416 --> 01:28:34,166
[OOLONG LAUGHS]

437
01:28:34,250 --> 01:28:35,416
Awesome, Gohan!

438
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:37,250
Looks like we're having
beans for breakfast!

439
01:28:37,333 --> 01:28:40,291
Where's Icarus?
He's not hurt, is he?

440
01:28:40,375 --> 01:28:43,583
[GOHAN] I almost forgot! Icarus!
I need to go find him!

441
01:28:43,666 --> 01:28:46,208
[KRILLIN] Here! Give those to
me! I'll take care of your Dad!

442
01:28:49,125 --> 01:28:52,208
Now, now! Did you really
think you'd gotten away?

443
01:28:52,291 --> 01:28:54,541
Oh, no! What do we do?

444
01:28:56,291 --> 01:29:00,708
We had them! They were
right in our hands! You!

445
01:29:00,791 --> 01:29:02,333
[KRILLIN]
You ruined everything!

446
01:29:06,208 --> 01:29:07,875
I don't believe it!

447
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,208
[OOLONG] Oh, no! Goku? Goku!

448
01:29:12,291 --> 01:29:14,541
Hey, Gohan, catch!

449
01:29:14,625 --> 01:29:17,000
[GOHAN] Thank goodness!
It's still here!

450
01:29:17,083 --> 01:29:19,375
[GOHAN] Here Dad!
Take this! Quick!

451
01:29:19,458 --> 01:29:21,541
A bean! But how?

452
01:29:21,625 --> 01:29:23,958
[GOHAN] There's no time
to explain! Just eat!

453
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:43,458
Krillin, no!

454
01:29:43,541 --> 01:29:45,166
You jerk!

455
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:54,125
Kids! They never
know their own limits!

456
01:29:54,208 --> 01:29:58,166
[SALZA] Now it's time to take
care of the sick and wounded!

457
01:29:58,250 --> 01:30:00,416
It must have been a fluke!

458
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:01,791
[SALZA] I don't see
how a guy like this

459
01:30:01,875 --> 01:30:04,250
could have possibly
killed Frieza!

460
01:30:08,458 --> 01:30:12,458
Huh? What's this?
Impossible...!

461
01:30:12,541 --> 01:30:15,583
I'm picking up a power level
that's going off the scale!

462
01:30:15,666 --> 01:30:17,291
[SALZA] But the
Saiyan was barely alive...!

463
01:30:17,375 --> 01:30:19,625
And the only other
one in there was that pig!

464
01:30:19,708 --> 01:30:21,500
[SALZA] It couldn't be
the pig, could it?

465
01:30:27,041 --> 01:30:28,416
[SALZA] What
the heck's going on?

466
01:30:31,625 --> 01:30:32,916
[SALZA]
