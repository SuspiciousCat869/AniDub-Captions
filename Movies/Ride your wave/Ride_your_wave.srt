00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,070
by apartment number.

170
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,822
- (crying) I left teddy upstairs.

171
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:33,865
-The fire is contained

172
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,242
and residents have evacuated
to the ground floor.

173
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,078
One woman from the eighth
floor is unaccounted for.

174
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,206
Hoses two and three, locate
the eighth floor resident next.

175
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,874
- [Kawamura] Roger.

176
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,465
(fireworks popping)

177
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,136
(Hinako yelps)

178
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,061
(Hinako panting)

179
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,440
- [Hinako] Someone help!

180
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,566
(fireworks rumbling)

181
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,943
- [Lieutenant] Someone's on the roof.

182
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:10,985
Get up there.

183
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,988
(Kawamura panting)

184
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,659
- [Kawamura] Are you hurt?

185
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:22,747
(cherry picker whirring)
(dreamy bells tinkling)

186
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,667
(fireworks rumbling)

187
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,336
(Hinako gasps)

188
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,715
(fireworks popping)

189
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,846
- Are you all right?

190
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,347
- Huh?

191
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,765
I, uh...

192
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:41,891
- You injured?

193
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,226
- No, I'm fine.

194
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,228
- Remain calm.

195
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:48,064
We'll get you down safely.

196
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,899
- Can I take my board with me, too?

197
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:51,943
- Of course.

198
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,612
Sorry, it's cramped.

199
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:55,905
It's best if you squat.

200
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,158
| have a resident on board.

201
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,325
Please take us down.

202
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,082
(cherry picker whirring)

203
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,799
(crowd murmuring)

204
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,176
- Okubo.
- Yes, sir.

205
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,052
- Nice job guys.
-Thank you, sir.

206
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,805
- Trespassing and the
use of illegal fireworks?

207
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,515
- Back it up, let's go.
-You're safe now.

208
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,434
-Thanks so much for rescuing me.

209
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,394
- No, I should thank you.

210
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:27,228
- Huh?

211
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,062
-You know the rules.

212
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,690
No personal items aboard
the cherry picker.

213
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,483
- [Minato] Sorry, sir.

214
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,068
- That's my fault.

215
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,070
- It must mean a lot, your board.

216
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,949
- I've been using it since
| was a kid, so, guess so.

217
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,660
- I hope to see you again,
riding the waves, I mean.

218
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,164
| can see you out there
from our rooftop,

219
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,250
the station's roof--
- Hinageshi, time to go!

220
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,084
(Minato chuckles)

221
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,419
- [Minato] See you round.

222
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,046
- Wait.

223
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,633
How about next time,
if you'd like, I mean,

224
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,927
| could teach you how to ride

225
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,261
the waves, that is.

226
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,764
Unless you already know how?

227
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,189
(firefighters cheering)

228
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,275
- [Firefighter] Eye on the prize,
eye on the prize.

229
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,445
(Kawamura grunting)

230
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,301
- [Firefighter] Come on,
one more try, you got it.

231
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,805
- [Firefighter] Pull yourself up.

232
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:44,973
You can still do this.

233
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,185
- [Firefighter] Better
not be giving up, newbie.

234
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,360
- I believe in you.
- You can still do it.

235
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:58,903
You've come this far.
- Don't be a quitter.

236
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,864
(Kawamura panting)

237
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,117
- [Minato] (sighs) What a day.

238
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,079
- I'm not sure if
I'm cut out for this.

239
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:09,163
- [Minato] Don't worry about it.

240
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:09,998
When you're down, just get back up.

241
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,042
- You say that like it's so easy.

242
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,545
| think maybe I've chosen
the wrong career path.

243
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,006
- Driver engineer Koba's map.

244
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:18,840
Have you ever seen it?

245
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,633
He just transferred

246
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,678
yet already knows all the
water systems and shortcuts.

247
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,763
Getting that good is no easy task.

248
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,974
You've gotta have the
resolve to keep on pushing

249
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,559
if you wanna reach that level.

250
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,103
You're a strong guy.

251
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,397
If I can do it, I know you can.

252
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,107
Later.
- Hang on.

253
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:38,735
You're in a good mood.

254
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,362
- 'Bout to ride some waves.

255
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,158
(bright music)

256
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,667
Was this too early for you?

257
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,044
- Huh, no.

258
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,881
I'm not sleepy at all. (gasps)

259
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,174
That was weird.

260
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,092
- You can nap until we get there.

261
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:03,968
Don't blame ya.

262
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,219
Moving can be tiring.

263
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,387
- [Hinako] Well, it was
just the eighth floor

264
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,681
to the second this time,
so it wasn't that bad.

265
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:09,766
I'm pretty much done.

266
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:10,600
- [Minato] Those balconies

267
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,643
are made of really flammable material.

268
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,686
The flames from the bottom

269
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,480
ate their way right up to the top.

270
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,231
So, be extra careful
when you're out there.

271
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,066
- [Hinako] For sure.

272
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,026
But seriously, what a pain.

273
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,029
All 'cause people just had
to set off illegal fireworks.

274
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,822
Meanwhile, you have to risk your life

275
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,491
'cause people decide to be morons.

276
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,076
- [Minato] Yeah, |
really wish they'd stop.

277
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,327
| hear they do it

278
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,829
so they can make videos
and share it online.

279
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,498
- My family used to live in this area

280
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,791
when I was a little kid.

281
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,960
But then we had to move
after my dad got a promotion.

282
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,213
| always wanted to come back, though.

283
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,006
So, I applied to the college here.

284
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,928
What about, you, mister...

285
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:47,887
- [Minato] What?

286
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,764
- Ah, I'm so sorry.

287
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,725
| realized I don't know
how to say your last name.

288
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,185
- It's Hinageshi.

289
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,019
- [Hinako] Huh?

290
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:59,649
So that's how you say it,
Minato Hinageshi, like that?

291
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,318
- People never know how to
say it, but I don't mind.

292
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,278
- [Hinako] I get it.

293
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,239
My last name is Mukaimizu.

294
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,991
People are always calling
me Mukomizu, though.

295
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,494
- Oh, hey, if a fire breaks out,

296
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,205
get to the ground floor
as quickly as possible.

297
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,040
- [Hinako] Is that a finless porpoise?

298
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,125
- It is.

299
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,127
It's not a beluga.

300
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,753
- Knew it, I thought
you might like them.

301
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,297
You know, your car even
kind of looks like one.

302
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,966
| really love them, too.

303
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,011
Don't they look like that
show "Little Ghost Q-Taro?"

304
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,847
- Wanna listen to something?

305
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,473
What music do you like?

306
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,850
- I'll listen to whatever you want.

307
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,476
- Mm, let's see

308
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,857
> Oh oh oh )

309
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,233
- Ah, this song.

310
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,568
Takes me back.

311
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,819
- Since they used it in that movie,

312
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,612
they've been playing it a lot.

313
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,739
D> There you are )

314
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,575
> Out on the water )

315
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:55,371
D I can see your smiling
face reflect back at me )

316
00:15:55,538 --> 00:16:00,209
> Day grows long, colors
around us change )

317
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:04,422
> But you're still
sparkling evermore )

318
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:08,342
(singing in foreign language)

319
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,471
- [Hinako] I see you've
bought yourself a board.

320
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,973
- Well, I'll need a lot of
practice if I wanna get good.

321
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,017
Besides, it's always
been a dream of mine

322
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,603
to have a surfboard attached
to the top of my car.

323
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:24,400
- Oh, a full wetsuit in
the middle of summer.

324
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,111
That's so cool.

325
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,113
You'll pick this up in no time.

326
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:29,947
(bright music)

327
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,324
Keep your head up.

328
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,950
Paddle, paddle, paddle.

329
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,994
Paddle, paddle, paddle, paddle.

330
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,078
Now, pop up.

331
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,539
(Minato groans)

332
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,041
Paddle, paddle, paddle.

333
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,709
Now, pop up, hurry.

334
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:43,794
(Minato groans)

335
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,631
(Minato panting)

336
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,760
Paddle, paddle, paddle.

337
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,305
Good, now stand up.

338
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,890
Keep your balance.

339
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,103
(Minato panting)

340
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,647
Are you sure you okay?

341
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:09,237
- I'll try again this afternoon.

342
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,657
(Minato coughs)

343
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,326
I'll make us some coffee.

344
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,285
- With that thing?

345
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,205
(Hinako sniffing)

346
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,581
Hmm, that smells good.

347
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,751
- [Minato] I brought a blend
| thought would go well

348
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:24,835
with the sandwiches.

349
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,797
(Hinako gasps)

350
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,424
Freshly ground beans really
make the coffee bloom.

351
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,467
- [Hinako] Why's that?

352
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,177
- [Minato] Well, when you
use freshly ground beans

353
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,471
with a dripper, it
releases carbon dioxide.

354
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:36,847
- Sounds complicated.

355
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,355
- [Minato] Time for the egg sandwiches

356
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,363
- [Hinako] Is there anything you can't do?

357
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,533
Are you a superhero in disguise?

358
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:08,462
(sighs) They're so perfect.
(bird cawing)

359
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,007
| thought this when you
rescued me from the fire,

360
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,593
but you're basically a
hero, Hinageshi, aren't you?

361
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,553
-That's an overstatement.

362
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,723
And you know, just call me Minato.

363
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,683
Is it okay if I call you Hinako?

364
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,603
(car horn blaring)

365
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,895
(Hinako gasps)

366
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,064
WATCH OUT FOR KITES!!
- [Hinako] He stole my sandwich.

367
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,275
Paddle, paddle.
(bright music)

368
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,693
- [Minato] Whoa.

369
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,821
- [Hinako] That's it, now stand.

370
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,824
(Minato grunting)

371
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,868
- [Hinako] Yes, yes, like that.

372
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:39,869
You got it.

373
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,419
WATER DRIP - PAPER DRIP
NEL DRIP - FRENCH DRIP

374
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,339
(coffee machine hissing)

375
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,400
- I'm sorry.

376
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,527
| was no good even though
you took me all the way out

377
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,987
to the beginner's spot.

378
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,030
- Even if you fall,

379
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,658
you just have to get back
up to ride the next wave.

380
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,329
And if we hadn't have
come all the way out here,

381
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,831
we wouldn't have come to
this lovely little cafe.

382
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,292
- It's great, huh?

383
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:31,045
I've been meaning to
check it out for a while.

384
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,923
Mm, good to see they've
got a few extinguishers.

385
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,383
(Minato gasps)
(Hinako giggling)

386
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,468
- You know, I've got
this funny feeling that

387
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,262
if something were to
happen, you'd be there for me.

388
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:43,015
- Mm-hmm, I'll always
be there, definitely.

389
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,520
(car horn blaring)

390
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,688
- Well, we'd better get going, huh?

391
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,148
- Uh, yeah.

392
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,608
Hey, you don't have to do that.

393
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,402
| got it.
- It's fine.

394
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,445
- [Minato] No, wait.

395
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,614
(Hinako yelping)

396
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,784
(objects clattering)

397
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,537
-I am so sorry.

398
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,789
- Don't worry, it's quite all right.

399
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,083
It happens all the time.

400
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,627
- Tokyo?
- I'm from Chiba.

401
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,337
- Oh, really?

402
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:14,880
- [Grandpa Owner] One
of our former employees

403
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,007
just opened a cafe there.

404
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,759
You should visit it sometime.

405
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,720
- [Grandma Owner] He has
slightly more modern equipment

406
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:21,929
than we do here.

407
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:25,808
- It's not a bad life.

408
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,310
| wouldn't mind running
a cafe like this one.

409
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,604
- Sorry for getting so
flustered back there.

410
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:32,440
- Hey, know what?

411
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,318
I'd like to do this
again with you sometime.

412
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,363
Surfing, if you can call
what I'm doing that.

413
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,323
And even grab another coffee.

414
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,076
I'd also like to check
out other surf spots.

415
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,411
- Wait a second.

416
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,662

417
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,582

Then have it like this.

-You're right, it's
sweet but not too sweet.

00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,385
- I'm a what?
- It may be small,

491
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,721
but it is one of the most
deadly marine animals

492
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,055
in existence.

493
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,683
- Well, aren't you
a walking encyclopedia?

494
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,059
- I'm leaving.

495
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:19,893
| only came here

496
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,478
'cause I wanted see what
your girlfriend was like.

497
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,188
And I've seen
everything I need to see.

498
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,732
- [Minato] What's that
supposed to mean?

499
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,234
- Falling in love is
something only idiots do.

500
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:29,194
This blue-ringed octopus
is so full of venom,

501
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,072
she needs to go home, bye.

502
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,699
- [Hinako] See you later, bye.

503
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,034
- Later?

504
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,453
- Yeah 'cause I'm immune
to octopus venom, see?

505
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:41,331
- [Yoko] Ugh. (groans)

506
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,542
- Thanks for being so chill just now.

507
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,045
That winning attitude of hers

508
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,297
hasn't exactly
garnered her many friends.

509
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,674
She had been avoiding
school because of that.

510
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:54,470
But she suddenly started
going again recently.

511
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,888
- Well, that's good.

512
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,474
- She's a handful, but maybe
you guys could be friends.

513
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,475
- Of course.

514
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,604
(gentle music)

515
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:06,732
(Hinako gasps)
(Hinako giggling)

516
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,067
Look at that.

517
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,401
It's Mount Fuji.

518
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:13,822
(camera shutter clicking)

519
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,493
It's so pretty.

520
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,662
- [Announcer] This message
goes out to Mai Uchida

521
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,456
from Shota Namikoshi.

522
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:25,375
Merry Christmas, let's
stay together forever.

523
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,127
Will you marry me?

524
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,130
- So sweet.
- How romantic, I love it.

525
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,173
- [Minato] You think so?

526
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,966
You know, they're
just reading messages

527
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,301
from people who
submitted them in advance.

528
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:35,719
- [Announcer] I think it's
about time we got married.

529
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,429
I'm waiting for your proposal.
- So, you wanna go up?

530
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,223
- [Announcer] Merry Christmas.

531
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,475
This message goes out
to Yoshiko Kamiichi.

532
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,603
Thank you for everything, Mom.

533
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,230
Merry Christmas.

534
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:47,648
- [Hinako] What a view.

535
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,775
| wonder if we can see
my house from here.

536
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,111
(people chattering)

537
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,862
Wow.

538
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,322
- [Minato] Wanna do one too?

539
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:56,365
- Huh?

540
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,534
It's okay, I wouldn't
know what to write.

541
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,869
- Is it because you still don't
know how to write my name?

542
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,371
-That's not true.

543
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:03,288
- Great.

544
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:09,628
HINAKO MUKAIMIZU

545
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,046
And?

546
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,009
MINATO HINAGESHI

547
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,887
- Your last name is
just too hard to write.

548
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,306
- What are you gonna do when
it becomes your last name?

549
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,141
- Huh?

550
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,725
What did you say?

551
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,687
(Minato whistling)

552
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,021
Hey.

553
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,731
-The photo line is real long.

554
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:30,566
- [Photographer] That's it.

555
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:31,525
Looking good, you two.

556
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,610
What a cute couple.

557
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,864
Perfect, okay, let's take one more.

558
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,407
Hold right there, got it.

559
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,159
- [Minato] Hinako, come over here.

560
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,202
| want you to see something.
- Another cute couple.

561
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,746
Get a little closer, great.
(camera shutter clicking)

562
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,749
Hold her with those big strong arms.

563
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,626
- [Hinako] The key to your heart.

564
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,461
- [Photographer] Smile, one
more big smile for the camera.

565
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,589
- [Minato] Here.

566
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:54,506
(lock clicks)

567
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,260
- [Hinako] It's snowing.

568
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:01,638
(Hinako sighing)

569
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,807
- Wish I didn't have
to go to work tomorrow.

570
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,184
Working on Christmas...

571
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,811
You know, after it snows,

572
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,647
you can get these
really great big waves.

573
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,357
They say if you catch one,

574
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,776
whatever you wish for will come true.

575
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,445
I've never done it though.

576
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,335
- So good.

577
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,880
How do you get it to
not slip off each time?

578
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,007
- Okay, the outside needs to be cooked

579
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:38,425
while the inside's runny.

580
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:41,094
Getting it to stay is all
about keeping it soft.

581
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:43,972
See, like that.

582
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,226
You wanna give it a go?

583
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,143
- Mm-hmm.

584
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:50,520
Ah.
- Don't worry.

585
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:51,396
You can still save it.

586
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,440
Just calmly lift it, oh.

587
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,654
(chuckle) You sure having
omurice in the middle of nowhere

588
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,988
is how you want to spend Christmas?

589
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,157
-Yep, it's what I'd always
have on special occasions

590
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,909
when I was a kid, thanks.

591
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,245
And I wanted it to be
just two of us tonight.

592
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,164
- Can you eat with
your left hand, though?

593
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,290
- I got this.

594
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,541
I've been practicing.

595
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,793
I wanted to make sure I could eat

596
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,461
without letting go of your hand.

597
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:19,049
If it were up to me, I'd
never let go of your hand.

598
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:20,717
- I'm gonna get my own place soon.

599
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,177
Do you wanna move in?

600
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:23,345
- Don't joke like that.

601
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:24,846
What if I really said yes?

602
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,807
- Great, when?

603
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:27,641
- Huh?

604
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:29,559
| don't know if
I'm ready for that yet.

605
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:33,272
(gentle piano music)

606
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,232
Not until I can ride my own wave.

607
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:39,319
| feel like I rely on you
all the time for everything.

608
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:42,739
But I hope I can find my
footing on dry land too,

609
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,909
and finally find something
I'm good at, like you have.

610
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:47,577
-You've already got
something you're good at,

611
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,122
so I'm sure you'll
find your path soon.

612
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,749
I've never been particularly
good at anything.

613
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,543
- You're joking, right?

614
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,754
-When I was a kid, |
almost drowned in the ocean.

615
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,340
I can still remember every
detail about that day.

616
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:03,760
| promised myself
| would become strong,

617
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,471
but instead I failed at
everything I tried to do.

618
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,599
And then, suddenly one day, |
came across a newborn turtle.

619
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,768
- [Hinako] A baby sea turtle?

620
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,270
- [Minato] Yeah, they're
all over the beach.

621
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,355
SEA TURTLES LAY THEIR EGGS HERE.
You've never seen one?

622
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,232
-Whoa, what's that?

623
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:18,150
Turtles?

624
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,820
Watching them struggle
towards the ocean

625
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,405
with such persistence,

626
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:26,408
it made me realize how much
determination I needed.

627
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:29,369
So, I started joining my
grandpa on his beach patrols.

628
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,245
That's when I got a sense

629
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:31,913
of what I wanted to do with my life.

630
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,207
And it dawned on me that
| wanted some kind of job

631
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,584
where I could help people.

632
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,589
- I love that story.

633
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:43,008
| have a hard enough time
taking care of myself,

634
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:44,718
let alone helping others.

635
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:46,762
I'm always the one needing help.

636
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,765
You seem to be able to just do
anything with ease, though.

637
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,516
-That simply isn't true.

638
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,852
| still can't surf like you can.

639
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,563
Try thinking of the sea and
the shore as no different.

640
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,607
You paddle, and when you get tired,

641
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,567
catch your breath and paddle again.

642
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:03,403
You can think of me as
your harbor, if you want.

643
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:07,282
When you need a break, just
call for me and I'll be there.

644
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:09,743
- How long will you be
there for me, I wonder.

645
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,662
- 10 years, 20?

646
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,998
When every hair has turned gray.

647
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:17,501
Until you're able to
ride those waves alone.

648
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,970
(jet ski riders cheering)

649
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,555
D> There you are )

650
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,308
> Out on the water )

651
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:38,397
D I can see your smiling
face reflect back at me )

652
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:43,026
(phone ringing)

653
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:46,321
Hmm?

654
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:47,239
What?

655
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,574
GONE SURFING
No way.

656
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,174
- [Jet Ski Rider] Whoohoo!

657
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,801
Oh yeah!
- Coming through!

658
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,469
- All right!
- Yeah!

659
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,974
(dramatic music)

660
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:22,399
- Hey, where did he go?
- Call 911.

661
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,067
- Somebody help!
- I'll swim

662
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,319
and see if I can find him.

663
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,030
- Ah.

664
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,116
(Hinako groans)

665
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:35,162
Aw, Minato, who said you
could go surfing without me?

666
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,254
Huh?

667
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:15,660
(siren wailing)

668
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,578
- Hinako?

669
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,957
(panting) Hinako!

670
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:30,759
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SAVING TEDDY,
YUKI YOSHIKAWA

How are you doing?

680

Please give me a call when

- [Yoko] Hello?

686
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,776
We know you're in there.

687
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:31,736
Please, open the door.

688
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:39,744
- Sorry for stopping by
without giving you a heads up.

689
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:44,457
The new place is nice,
further inland, I see.

690
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,668
- [Hinako] I figured I wouldn't
have to look at the sea

691
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:47,794
from out here.

692
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:48,628
(Kawamura gasps)

693
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,797
- Here, this is some
of my brother's stuff

694
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:52,424
from the firehouse.
(Hinako gasps)

695
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,259
If you want anything, just take it.

696
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:57,262
- I'm sorry.

697
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:00,098
It was insensitive to not call first.

698
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:01,766
It must very be painful for you.

699
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,019
- Are you seriously
doing this right now?

700
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:07,981
- [Kawamura] I never
thought I'd be (sniffing)

701
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:12,235
Sent out on a search and rescue
mission for Minato. (crying)

702
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,238
It's just like him, though.

703
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:19,200
He sacrificed his own life in
order to save someone else's.

704
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,535
- You're wrong.

705
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,290
It's my fault.

706
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,376
| told him the best waves occur
the morning after it snows.

707
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:29,419
- Cut it out.

708
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:32,464
Saying that isn't going to
bring my brother back, you know?

709
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,300
- Sorry.

710
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:39,095
I'm just (crying) so sorry.

711
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,391
- [Yoko] This is his cell phone.

712
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,809
It's yours if you want it.

713
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,728
Throw it out for all I care.
- Yoko, please don't--

714
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:47,562
- [Yoko] What?

715
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:48,855
It'd be better if she did.

716
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:52,442
- My card, it's got my number.

717
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:56,655
If you need anything, anything
at all, I'll be there.

718
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:57,572
Yoko, wait.

719
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,631
- Is that a finless porpoise?

720
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:17,175
- [Minato] This app
tracks surfing conditions.

721
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:18,968
- [Hinako] I didn't know that existed.

722
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,346
- |I can download it to
your phone if you want.

723
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:31,606
(phone line trilling)
(Minato's phone buzzing)

724
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:32,774
- [Voicemail] The number

Please leave a message after the beep.

727
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:39,447
(Hinako groaning)

728
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,784
- Even if I left a message,
it's not like you would get it.

729
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,744
You said you'd be by my side forever.

730
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:53,962
Minato?

731
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:57,173
(bubbles popping)

732
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,091
Oh.

733
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:04,514
(Hinako whimpers)

734
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,945
- [Jun] Come on, you've
gotta eat something.

735
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,451
- [Ai] Here, coffee would
do you good, too.

736
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,412
(Hinako whimpering)

737
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,329
There, there.

738
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,708
(Hinako sobbing)

739
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,627
- I know, everything
reminds you of him.

740
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,880
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

741
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:37,756
- It's normal.

742
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,258
- [Hinako] You guys are
being so nice to me.

743
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:41,634
And you were the ones who always said

744
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,220
we were such sappy lovey-dovey idiots

745
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,640
that we'd make all other
couples heads explode.

746
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,642
- Sorry.
- We take it all back.

747
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,396
Is that your boyfriend's?

748
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:55,190
- [Hinako] Yeah, but |
can't see what's on it

749
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,316
'cause it's locked.

750
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,819
We always went surfing together.

751
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:03,907
So why'd he go out on his own,
and while it was still dark?

752
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:04,824
I need to know.

753
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:13,249
- So, that's a blue-ringed octopus?

754
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,794
- [Hinako] Hey, Yoko,
when's your birthday?

755
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,086
- [Yoko] February 3rd.

756
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,256
Which, by the way, my
brother never remembered.

757
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,384
- When is World Marine Day?
- July 15th.

758
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,137
- Disaster Prevention Day?
- September 1st.

759
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,972
- [Hinako] It's no one
I know's birthday,

760
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,309
the day of the fire, nor our
first date surfing. (sighing)

761
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,061
It's none of the days I can think of.

762
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,146
- You should ask Wasabi.

763
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,439
- Huh?
-You met him.

764
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,858
He brought you the box, Miss Mikomizu.

765
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,401
- Kawamura?

766
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,488
Oh, and it's Mukaimizu.

767
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,031
- I'll ask him to coffee.

768
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:46,366
He should be off today.

769
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:52,372
This is the same as the other place.

770
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,374
Their main store is in Chigasaki.

771
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,668
- It's not a bad life.

772
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,128
| wouldn't mind running
a cafe like this one.

773
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,589
There are lots of different
ways to brew coffee.

774
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,591
-That's pretty cool.

775
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,510
| want a strawberry soda.

776
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:10,431
(Hinako gasps)

777
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:12,976
Sorry for the, ah!

778
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,811
- What the heck, man?
- Are you okay?

779
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:17,063
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't touch it.

780
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,314
I'll go get some towels.

781
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,402
- Ah, I am so sorry.

782
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:24,279
(Hinako whimpers)

783
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,154
- Don't you dare.

784
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,407
It'll make the coffee taste bad.

785
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:28,616
- Sorry.

786
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,493
I'm not a crybaby, at
least I didn't used to be.

787
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,079
- Oh come on, I've seen
newborns cry less than you.

788
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:34,330
- Yoko, please.

789
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,958
- I apologize for being so blunt.

790
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,502
- Hey, don't worry about it, okay?

791
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:42,422
| mean, you've got to be
true who you are, right?

792
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,632
(singing in foreign language)
(Hinako gasps)

793
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,175
Oh, I know this song

face reflect back at me )

796
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:03,985
Minato?

797
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:10,617
- Are you okay?

798
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,911
- [Hinako] I just saw Minato.

799
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:13,828
- Have you lost it?

800
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:15,997
Come on, get it together.

801
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,087
- Minato.

802
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,505
- Okay, listen up.

803
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,008
My brother is dead and
he is not coming back.

804
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,844
And you just need to accept that.

But why?

813
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:35,284
Why's he in the water?

814
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,205
Is it 'cause of that song?

815
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,458

(Hinako whimpers)

818
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:57,265
Hey, guys.

819
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:00,059
- What's up?

820
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,978
- Do I seem weird to you?

821
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:02,895
- [Ai] Weird looking?

822
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,522
Or weird in the head?

823
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:08,026
- Like having hallucinations,
that kind of weird.

824
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,944
-You're not taking
weird drugs are you?

825
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:11,529
- [Ail That would be really bad.

826
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,322
You're weird enough as it is.

827
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,199
- I'm not taking drugs.

828
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,953
But I can see Minato
wherever there's water.

829
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:21,914
D> There you are )

> I can see your )
- Hey, wait.

832
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:29,088
- Minato.
(gentle music)

833
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:29,922
Look, see?

834
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,883
He's right there doing the Shaka sign.

835
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,260
- [Ai] Maybe you are
weirder than normal.

836
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:35,803
- [Jun] Why don't you go
back home for a while?

837
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,348
You need to take it
easy, okay, Hinako?

838
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:44,437
(Hinako humming)
(gentle music)

839
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:54,363

HINAKO

(Hinako gasps)

844
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:13,299
Look, up there, right there.

845
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:35,154
It was definitely
Minato, I'm sure of it.

846
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,073
Is he a ghost?

847
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,033
Does that mean he's stuck in limbo?

848
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,827
Or is it 'cause he died at sea?

849
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:44,413
Is that why he's
appearing to me in water?

850
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:49,168
(Hinako gasps)

851
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:55,424
Am I really trying to take a
picture of a ghost right now?

00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,343

(Hinako gasps)

868
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,106
Minato.

869
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:00,823
But why are you?

870
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,325
- I promised to always be there

871
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,035
if you needed my help, didn't I?

872
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:09,415
- Minato.

873
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,500
- [Minato] Hinako.

874
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,377
-This is a bit weird.

875
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,837
- It sure is.

876
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:18,758
- So, does this mean
you couldn't pass on?

877
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:20,551
- Uh, maybe.

878
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,970
- [Hinako] Did you have
any unfinished business?

879
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,764
- Or maybe my wish came true.

880
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:35,191
Did you move again?

881
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:36,067
- [Hinako] What?

882
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:37,777
Uh, yeah.

883
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:39,403
- [Minato] Are you not surfing?

884
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:41,989
- It's too sad.

885
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,449
| can't.
- Sorry.

886
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:44,867
It's my fault, isn't it?

887
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:46,160
- Ah, I didn't mean to--

888
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:48,829
Tell you what, let's not be sad, okay?

889
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,374
Talking to you is
like a dream come true

890
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,376
and I don't want to ruin it.

891
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:56,254
So you appear in water whenever
| sing that song, right?

892
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:58,923
- I don't quite know how it works.

893
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,717
But if you need my
help, just call, okay?

894
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,678
- Oh, Yoko's doing well.

895
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:04,971
Wasabi, too.

896
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,555
- [Minato] Yeah, I saw
them for a second.

897
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,182
- Oh, that's right.

898
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:11,269
It didn't seem like either of
them could see you, though.

899
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,854
Does that mean I'm the
only one who can then?

900
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,606
- Maybe, but I don't really mind,

901
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,066
as long as I can be seen by you.

902
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:18,109
- [Hinako] I guess.

903
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,111
(gasp) Oh yeah.

904
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:23,489
Could you tell me your passcode?

905
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:25,908
- [Minato] Why do you
wanna get into my phone?

906
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:29,245
- It's because I wanna know

907
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:31,580
why you went surfing
all by yourself, okay?

908
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:37,503
- You see, I wanted
to practice in secret

909
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,630
and surprise you
with how good I'd gotten.

910
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:40,673
- [Hinako] Really?

911
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,133
- It's the truth.

912
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,968
Funny, I don't seem to recall

913
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:45,344
giving my girlfriend permission

914
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,805
to try to break into my phone, though.

915
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:49,724
(Hinako groans)

916
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:50,641
- Huh?

917
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,060
You know what?

918
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,854
| should probably go take a bath.

919
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:56,272
Don't go anywhere, okay?

920
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:09,452
What am I doing?

921
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:11,662
Are Minato and I living together?

922
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,332
Does that mean we'll get married?

923
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:19,003
Hinako Hinageshi? (giggling)

924
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,463

928
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,181
(Hinako yelps)

929
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:31,349
You pervert!

930
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,934
- Oh, sorry, but you started singing.

931
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:34,810
- You're right.

932
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,729
You just scared me.

933
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:38,439
It's not like I mind.

934
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:54,038
(firefighters chattering)

935
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:46,984
-Whoa.

936
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:49,820
(Hinako gasping)

937
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:53,449
You okay?

938
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:55,576
Sorry, I didn't see you.

939
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:57,536
- I'm sorry about that.

940
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,331
- Where do you come from?
- Oh, well, I'm from Chiba.

941
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,082
- [Man] We're in Chiba.

942
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,335
So who's the big guy?

943
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,089
- [Hinako] Something wrong?

944
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:12,051
- [Minato] Well, I was just thinking

945
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:14,887
about how I can't hold
your hand, anymore.

946
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:17,723
And how I can't help you like
that guy did earlier, either.

947
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:18,641
- Huh?

948
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,393
Could you be a little jealous?
- You got it wrong.

949
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,645
- I'm not gonna cheat, okay?

950
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:23,979
I only have eyes for you.

951
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:26,190
-That's not what I meant at all.

952
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:28,442
- I think this might
be our first fight.

953
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:29,652
Please don't be mad.

954
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,489
(Hinako giggles)

955
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:36,450
- Another, please.
- Ooh, someone's greedy.

956
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:39,036
Mwah!

957
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,247
Forgive me now?

958
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:44,083
- Not quite yet.
- What?

959
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,418
- 'Cause I need one
more thing from you.

960
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:47,628
- 'Kay, what is it?

961
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:48,879
- Take me to the ocean.

962
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,715
| wanna see you surf again.

963
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:52,841
That's what I'd like.

964
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:57,179
(waves whooshing)

965
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:13,696
- Sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

966
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:16,448
| should've realized that
you probably weren't ready.

967
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:22,204
-You know, I used to live
in this area when I was kid.

968
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,039
All I did was surf.

969
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:26,375
I could ride the waves
whenever I liked.

970
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:32,423
But now (sighs) whether it's
in the water or on land,

971
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,259
| just don't know which
direction I should be paddling.

972
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,932
- [Minato] No matter
how small the wave,

973
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,517
it contains the power built up

974
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,811
from traveling thousands of miles.

975
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:48,981
Right now, you're being
pushed back by that power.

976
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:51,650
I'm just one of those many waves,

977
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:54,737
and you have to prepare
yourself for the next one.

978
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,780
- Why do you have to say
depressing stuff like that?

979
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,199
As long as I can be with
you, Minato, I'll be fine.

980
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,659
That's all I want.

981
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,578
- [Minato] I'll be
here for you, Hinako.

982
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:04,913
I'll support you in any way I can

983
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,625
until one day you can
ride those waves of life.

984
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:16,592
(gentle music)

985
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,334
- Hi, come on in.
(door bells tinkling)

986
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,503
Oh, hey, what's up?

987
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:53,796
- Your mom was the one who told me

988
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,464
that you started working here.

989
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:57,591
| wanted to talk
to you about something.

990
00:52:57,758 --> 00:53:00,928
- Boss, so, I'm going on my break now.

991
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:02,721
Here, on the house.

992
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:04,306
What did you wanna talk about?

993
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,310
Stop worrying.

994
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:10,479
You just have to be true
to yourself, remember?

995
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:11,313
- [Kawamura] Actually--

996
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,149
- It's what my brother used
to say, so just suck it up.

997
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:16,485
- [Kawamura] Believe
it or not, I'm not here

998
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:18,737
to talk about how I screwed
up at work for once.

999
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,239
-You're not?

1000
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:22,074
- [Kawamura] It's about Hinako.

1001
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,411
- Oh, you don't say.

1002
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:29,498
- She's acting strange.
- Course she is.

1003
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:32,710
- I mean, I've seen her
talking to her water bottle.

1004
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,128
And skipping hand in hand

1005
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,380
with Minato's old blow-up porpoise.

1006
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:39,675
It's like she thinks that the
water is Minato or something.

1007
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:41,260
- [Yoko] Are you stalking her?

1008
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:44,096
- Well, I was worried.
- Why?

1009
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:46,223
- I'm not quite sure.

1010
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,809
Minato used to always watch her surf

1011
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:50,644
from the roof of the fire station,

1012
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:53,647
so I started watching too, and well,

1013
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:56,108
but she was Minato's
girlfriend, so I never,

1014
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:58,736
ah, I didn't mean to bring that up.

1015
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,612
I'm just worried
about Hinako, that's all.

1016
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:03,407
So, I can't help thinking about it.

1017
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:05,159
-You're so dumb.
- Huh?

1018
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,910
- If you're really that
worried about Hinako,

1019
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,370
then go talk to her.

1020
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:09,204
Don't talk to me.

1021
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,331
It's 'cause you're in
love with her, aren't you?

1022
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:12,875
- Uh...

1023
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:13,709
- And for the record,

1024
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:16,044
falling in love is
something idiots do.

1025
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:18,839
Hey, Boss, I'm done with my break now.

1026
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:21,675
(Kawamura sighs)

1027
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:27,473
(Hinako grunting)

1028
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:34,438
- Sorry.

1029
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:38,692
Here, I've been meaning
to return this to you.

1030
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:41,528
Wait, you're that fireman?

1031
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:45,073
- You never realized that was me?

1032
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,909
- Oh, I guess not.

1033
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,119
| probably won't
need the towel, though.

1034
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,079
You here for flowers?

1035
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:51,997
- Uh, right.

1036
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:57,002
(Hinako grunting)

1037
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:01,215
- I really hope that she enjoys these,

1038
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,716
whoever the lucky girl is.

1039
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:06,637
- Oh, actually, well,
she likes the sea.

1040
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:08,722
That's why I went with the
white and blue flowers.

1041
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:11,350
Too cheesy?
- No, not at all.

1042
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:13,185
It's so thoughtful.

1043
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:14,228
-Thank goodness.

1044
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,023
You don't have it with you today

1045
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:18,899
- Huh?

1046
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:21,485
- [Kawamura] You've been taking
it with you wherever you go.

1047
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:23,737
Your water bottle that is.
(Hinako sighs)

1048
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:24,947
- 'Cause I'm at work.

1049
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,490
- [Kawamura] You don't
have that porpoise, either.

1050
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:28,534
- Huh, you saw that?

1051
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:31,954
- I saw you in public with them,

1052
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,498
and then again when you
came into the station,

1053
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,124
but I didn't say anything.

1054
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:39,002
You were talking to the
bottle, as if it were Minato.

1055
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,380
- Ah, no, I was
just talking to myself.

1056
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:42,214
- But--
- Here.

1057
00:55:42,381 --> 00:55:43,298
Hurry up and take them.

1058
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,092
If you don't, they will wilt.

1059
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:47,052
- But they're for you, Hinako.
- Huh?

1060
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:51,348
It was for someone who liked the sea.

1061
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:54,726
- For a long time I've
been watching you now.

1062
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,770
Could I ever replace him?

1063
00:55:56,937 --> 00:56:00,107
Do you think one day, I might
be able to make you happy?

1064
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:02,776
Because I just wanna
see you happy again.

1065
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:04,111
'Cause I love you.

1066
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:07,072
- Uh, I can't.

1067
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:09,241
I'm sorry.

1068
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:12,119
(gentle music)

1069
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:14,955
(Kawamura sighs)

1070
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:20,544
D> There you are )

1071
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:22,296
> Out on the water )

1072
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:23,380
- What is it, Hinako?

1073
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:26,008
- Just now, Wasabi, he--
- Are you okay?

1074
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:26,925
What happened?

1075
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,719
- He tried to tell me he loves me.

1076
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:34,099
- And how do you feel?
- How do I feel?

1077
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:36,393
I'm in love with you, Minato.

1078
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,730
- But the reality is,
| can't hold your hand.

1079
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:42,441
I can't hold you or kiss you.

1080
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,779
Plus, he's a good guy.

1081
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,197
- [Hinako] Minato.

1082
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:52,034
- [Minato] He's an honest
person and has a gentle soul.

1083
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,911
- Why do you have to
say stuff like that?

1084
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,579
I'm fine with the way things are.

1085
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,080
| can see you whenever I want,

1086
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,750
even if we can't hold
hands or hug anymore.

1087
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,627
You said you'd be there
for me, didn't you?

1088
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:02,920
That's all that I want.

1089
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,421
- [Minato] Shh, calm down.

1090
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:07,299
People will hear you, and
you're talking to a toilet.

1091
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:08,133
- [Hinako] Huh?

1092
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,927
(Hinako's coworker gasps)

1093
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,304
Sorry, I got worked up.

1094
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:13,555
- Hinako, listen.

1095
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:17,434
New waves will always keep coming in.

1096
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:18,894
Not all of them will be good ones,

1097
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:21,521
you'll wanna let those pass.

1098
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:24,149
But if you keep staying
with your head underwater,

1099
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:27,152
you'll never learn to ride any waves.

1100
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:38,080
(Hinako panting)
(dramatic music)

1101
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,040
(tires screeching)
(vehicles rumbling)

1102
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:42,876
(Kawamura gasps)

1103
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:47,381
(Kawamura panting)

1104
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,257
- [Kawamura] Hinako!

1105
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,677
(explosion rumbling)

1106
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:52,511
(tires screeching)

1107
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:53,637
- [Man] Does someone
have a fire extinguisher?

1108
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:54,930
There's been accident.

1109
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:56,765
-The one driver is still inside.

1110
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:58,225
- No, there's nothing
we can do about them.

1111
00:57:58,392 --> 00:57:59,935
-They're trapped in the car.

1112
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:01,436
- It's too dangerous.
-We can't let them die.

1113
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:02,854
Minato wouldn't.

1114
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:06,108
D> There you are )

1115
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,276
<i>> Out on the water )
- Please, Hinako.</i>

1116
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,320
D I can see your smiling
face reflect back at me )

1117
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,072
- [Kawamura] Hinako!

1118
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:17,995
> Day grows long, colors
around us change )

1119
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,998
> But you're still »

1120
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:46,732
Minato!

1121
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:48,817
- What's wrong?
- It's Minato.

1122
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:50,444
| can't hear him anymore.
- Calm down.

1123
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,487
- Minato!
- It's gonna be okay.

1124
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,614
- Minato's disappearing.
- Please, Hinako.

1125
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,324
- He's turning into
steam and disappearing.

1126
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,952
- [Kawamura] Hinako, you need
to get a hold of yourself.

1127
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,288
I don't wanna be harsh,
but Minato is gone.

1128
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:02,414
He's not a ghost.

1129
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:04,791
- You might not be able to
see him, Wasabi, but I can.

1130
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:07,044
And I'm telling you that
Minato is in the water.

1131
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,670
He appears whenever I sing to him.

1132
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:11,048
| swear to you, it's really him.

1133
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,508
You say he's not there,
but you wouldn't know.

1134
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:18,096
Minato is going to be by
my side forever. (crying)

1135
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:19,514
- I'm sure he loved you enough

1136
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:21,266
that he would have done
everything in his power

1137
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:23,477
to try and appear to you
somehow, but I'm also sure

1138
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:25,896
that he would have never, ever
wanted to see you like this

1139
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:26,897
right now, Hinako.

1140
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:32,736
Minato used to say, "Hinako
inspires me and is my hero."

1141
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:34,029
We all thought it was so cool

1142
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:35,655
how you could ride those waves.

1143
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:37,407
But now...

1144
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:42,079
- I know but,
and I want to, it's just...

1145
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:44,122
(Hinako crying)

1146
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:45,874
- Minato will never
be able to be at peace

1147
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:47,459
if you do not move on.

1148
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,253
Hinako!
- Is everyone okay?

1149
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:54,382
- (panting) Minato.

1150
01:00:01,473 --> 01:00:02,849
D> There you are )

1151
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,851
> Out on the water )

1152
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:09,106
D I can see your smiling
face reflect back at me )

1153
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,733
- Hinako.
- I'm so sorry, Minato.

1154
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,236
This wouldn't have happened
if it weren't for me.

1155
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:17,364
It's 'cause I've been
relying on you too much.

1156
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:18,824
What do I do?

1157
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,368
How am I supposed to go
on without you in my life?

1158
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:23,036
I'm so sorry.

1159
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,642
D There you )

1160
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:52,607
(door bells tinkling)

1161
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:54,109
- Feel free to sit wherever.

1162
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:00,991
Our specialty is being
able to provide customers

1163
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:02,951
with the best coffee
in a variety of ways.

1164
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:04,411
| recommend our drip coffee.

1165
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:07,289
Whatever you do, please don't
order the strawberry soda.

1166
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:09,875
- Wow, you're really good at that.

1167
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:11,334
- Are you mocking me?

1168
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:12,460
- Course not.

1169
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:15,005
| came because I heard
that you were working here.

1170
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:16,548
- Wasabi?
- Yeah.

1171
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:18,758
- What else did he tell you?
- Huh?

1172
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,260
Nothing, really.

1173
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:24,014
- I really wish I was
a blue-ringed octopus

1174
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:25,849
because then I could bite you.

1175
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:26,766
- What?

1176
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,102
- Never mind.

1177
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:33,398
- [Hinako] Why are you
working here anyway, Yoko?

1178
01:01:33,565 --> 01:01:35,483
- [Yoko] I've decided
| want to open a cafe.

1179
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:36,318
- [Hinako] Huh?

1180
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:38,195
- [Yoko] My brother's dream
was to one day open a cafe,

1181
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,280
so, I'm gonna make it come true.

1182
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:41,114
(Hinako gasps)

1183
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:44,242
| took this job so I could
learn more about the business.

1184
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:46,286
Like this, a coffee bloom has to do

1185
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:48,663
with the release of carbon dioxide.

1186
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,624
Gas gets released
slowly from the beans

1187
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,083
after they're roasted.

1188
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,335
Once the beans are ground, though,

1189
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,921
it speeds up the release of CO2.

1190
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:59,549
So the fact that it blooms
means that the beans are fresh.

1191
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:00,842
When I finish high school,

1192
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:04,262
I'll go get trained at the
main branch in Chigasaki.

1193
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:05,597
| mean, the couple
that owns this place

1194
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:07,515
will eventually retire, right?

1195
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:14,272
(firefighters cheering)

1196
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:16,441
- [Firefighter] That's it,
you can do it.

1197
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:19,819
- [Firefighter] You got it,
you got it.

1198
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:22,656
- Nice job!
- All right, Kawamura!

1199
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:33,708
- A little late, don't you think?

1200
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:35,377
- Sorry.

1201
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:37,170
| was having a hard time accepting it,

1202
01:02:37,337 --> 01:02:40,799
so it's taken me a while
to come pay my respects.

1203
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,761
Where are your parents?
- At work.

1204
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:47,222
They've only just managed
to start working again,

1205
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:49,349
so it's not really the best time to...

1206
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:51,685
- Sorry, to have caused
so much trouble.

1207
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:54,062
- My brother's room is how he left it.

1208
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:55,397
Wanna see it?

1209
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:56,314
- [Hinako] Sure.

1210
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:03,571
- My brother always
seemed cool and collected,

1211
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:06,533
so people assumed
everything came easy to him.

1212
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:09,327
But the truth is he worked
hard at everything he did.

1213
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:12,872
Both our parents worked, so he
would have to make us dinner.

1214
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,833
It was awful in the beginning.

1215
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,421
But he'd read cookbooks
and watch cooking shows,

1216
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:22,340
and he was suddenly a gourmet chef.

1217
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:23,883
Same with studying.

1218
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,385
Even after he became a fireman,

1219
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:27,387
he said he had to keep working hard

1220
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:29,556
to make sure to keep
his head above water.

1221
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:32,517
| could never live up to that.

1222
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:34,227
And then, after he died,

1223
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:37,439
so many people came to the
house to pay their respects.

1224
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:39,941
They all said he'd
helped them somehow.

1225
01:03:40,108 --> 01:03:42,235
Minato always did whatever
he could to help others.

1226
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:43,653
It was his life's mission.

1227
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:47,532
Started when he was just a kid.

1228
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:50,577
He almost drowned when
he was a little boy,

1229
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:52,454
but someone saved him.

1230
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:53,997
The one who saved
him was a little girl

1231
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:55,623
who was even younger than my brother.

1232
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,460
It made him realize that he
could accomplish anything

1233
01:03:58,626 --> 01:03:59,919
as long as he worked hard.

1234
01:04:01,129 --> 01:04:03,590
His entire life was changed
by that little girl,

1235
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:05,008
So he wanted to become someone

1236
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:06,843
who could do the same for others.

1237
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,472
He said that a hero saved his life.

1238
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:13,433
He wanted to make sure
he made good use of it

1239
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,351
and save others.

1240
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:17,187
(dramatic music)

1241
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:25,111
(Hinako gasps)

1242
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:28,948
What now?

1243
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,533
Man. (sighs)

1244
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:32,285
MUKAIMIZU LANDSCAPING

1245
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:45,298
- So tell me, why the
sudden surprise visit?

1246
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:47,550
- Remember when I saved
a boy from drowning

1247
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,219
when I was a kid?

1248
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:51,179
- Didn't they give you an award?

1249
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:54,849
Hmm, I think it's here.

1250
01:04:57,352 --> 01:04:59,854
(lid pops)
Oh.

1251
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:01,815
Here it is.

1252
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:04,734
That kid called you his hero.

1253
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:12,784
(singing in foreign language)

1254
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:24,212
(Minato gasping)

1255
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:28,258
(Minato coughing)

1256
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:30,927
(gentle music)

1257
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:36,808
(Hinako gasps)

1258
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:39,018
(Hinako panting)

1259
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:41,896
(bubbles popping)

1260
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:53,283
(Hinako gasps)

1261
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:58,204
(Hinako grunting)

1262
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:06,045
- Way to go.
- Great job, kid.

1263
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:10,133
- Be on the lookout.

1264
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,260
Bring the ambulance
here when it arrives.

1265
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:15,847
- Oh.

1266
01:06:16,014 --> 01:06:16,764
(Minato coughing)

1267
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,725
- Yes, they did it!
- He's gonna be okay.

1268
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:20,477
(singing in foreign language)
(crowd chattering)

1269
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:22,479
-Turn him over.
- Kid, cough up the water.

1270
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:23,771
What a brave little girl.

1271
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:24,689
(Minato coughing)

1272
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:27,025
- You saved his life.
- That's my girl.

1273
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:28,776
(all cheering)
(Hinako laughing)

1274
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,403
- [Lifeguard] You did good, kiddo.

1275
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:33,364
- See that little girl over there?
She's the one who saved you.

1276
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:36,075
- [Yoko] He said that
a hero saved his life.

1277
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:38,286
- [Minato] When I was a kid,
| almost drowned in the ocean.

1278
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:40,997
I can still remember every
detail about that day.

1279
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:43,583
And it dawned on me that
| wanted some kind of job

1280
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,752
where I could to help people.

1281
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:47,045
Since they used it in that movie,

1282
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:48,630
they've been playing it a lot.

1283
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:50,632
D> That's right )

1284
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:53,301
(singing in foreign language)

1285
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:54,427
- Hinako.

1286
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:57,847
What about the strawberries?

1287
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:00,934
- [Minato] The day that I was reborn

1288
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:04,187
8 AUGUST 2006
was the day I found my reason for living.

1289
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,444
(Hinako gasps)

1290
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:15,532
- [Minato] Hinako, I got
to ride the waves

1291
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:19,118
after yesterday's snow and
pulled off an air reverse.

1292
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,537
You said my wish would come true

1293
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,539
if I could ride those waves, right?

1294
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:26,376
My wish is for you to able
to conquer life's waves.

1295
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:31,422
Well, that and for me to be
able to be by your side forever.

1296
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,346
(Hinako whimpers)

1297
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:41,266
(waves whooshing)

1298
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:52,652
Watching them struggle
towards the ocean

1299
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:53,903
with such persistence,

1300
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,531
it made me realize how much
determination I needed.

1301
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:07,792
JOBS HELPING OTHERS

1302
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:11,212
TOP 10 JOBS HELPING OTHERS

1303
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:13,881
1. LAWYER, 2. TEACHER, 3. CARE WORKER,
4. POLICE OFFICER, 5. SDF, 6. FIREMAN

1304
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,219
(Hinako grunts)

1305
01:08:18,386 --> 01:08:20,888
(bright music)

1306
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:28,062
- You interested in saving lives?

1307
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:30,565
We get everything

1308
01:08:30,732 --> 01:08:32,984
from surfers to those
can't even doggie paddle

1309
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,694
but just wanna help.

1310
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:36,029
Of course we're gonna train you

1311
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,363
in how to rescue people at sea,

1312
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:39,824
but our main goal
is to prevent accidents

1313
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:41,242
before they even happen.

1314
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:42,952
You'll have to pass
a qualification test,

1315
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,288
but there's plenty of free
time if you like sports.

1316
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:47,540
We've got six males and four females.

1317
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:49,042
Training camp and lifeguard duty

1318
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:50,543
both take place during the summer.

1319
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:52,754
We also run several community events.

1320
01:08:56,424 --> 01:08:58,176
(Kawamura panting)

1321
01:08:58,343 --> 01:08:59,719
- [Yoko] Yoohoo!

1322
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:00,637
- Huh?

1323
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:06,559
- [Yoko] You run even
on your days off?

1324
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:07,518
- [Kawamura] Well, I need to know

1325
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:09,729
where all the hydrants are,
and they sometimes move them.

1326
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:12,690
And that turned into a daily jog.

1327
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:14,609
It's not really in my
job description, though.

1328
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:16,194
- [Yoko] My brother
always used to go around

1329
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:18,237
making sure everything was safe too.

1330
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:19,822
He said the best firefighters

1331
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:21,324
are the ones who prevent fires.

1332
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:23,868
- Minato really was an amazing guy.

1333
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:26,120
No matter how hard |
try, I don't think I--

1334
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:26,954
- [Yoko] You're right.

1335
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:29,207
You could never fill his boots.

1336
01:09:29,374 --> 01:09:31,167
- (chuckles) So true.

1337
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:34,253
Could I ever replace him?

1338
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:37,131
Do you think one day, I might
be able to make you happy?

1339
01:09:38,216 --> 01:09:40,635
- Why'd you wanna become
a fireman, Wasabi?

1340
01:09:40,802 --> 01:09:41,469
- Huh?

1341
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:45,139
Oh, it's 'cause, well, 'cause
firemen are cool, aren't they?

1342
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:47,558
Plus, you get to
drive the fire engine.

1343
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:49,977
- You say that like it
would be such a no brainer.

1344
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:51,020
- Oh, thank you.

1345
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,563
-There's sugar if you want it.

1346
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:53,815
- Hmm.

1347
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:55,358
It probably was naive of me

1348
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:57,777
to choose a career path based on that.

1349
01:09:57,944 --> 01:09:58,653
You want some?
(Yoko stutters)

1350
01:09:58,820 --> 01:09:59,821
I've always been athletic,

1351
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:03,449
but the job is more physically
demanding that I expected.

1352
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:04,909
No matter how hard I try, though,

1353
01:10:05,076 --> 01:10:06,577
I'll never be as good as Minato.

1354
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:10,415
I'm not convinced I'm
cut out to be a fireman.

1355
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:13,501
Actually, saving lives is
probably beyond what I could do.

1356
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:19,966
Whoa, that's sweet.
-That's an understatement.

1357
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:21,718
- Ah, sorry, too much sugar.

1358
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:23,469
Well, guess I don't have
Minato's taste buds, either.

1359
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:26,431
- Minato this, Minato that, enough.

1360
01:10:26,597 --> 01:10:29,058
No one is asking you to
be just like my brother.

1361
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,643
Just focus on being yourself.

1362
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:31,853
That's all you need.

1363
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:36,649
- Ah, that was actually
really well put, Yoko.

1364
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:40,403
-You dummy, you're the one
who said that to me, remember?

1365
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:42,447
When I stopped going
to school, my mom asked

1366
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:45,658
why couldn't I be
more like my brother.

1367
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:46,826
But you were the one who told me

1368
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:48,745
that I should just be myself.

1369
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:49,579
I'm not like my brother,

1370
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:51,789
who always did his best at everything.

1371
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:53,750
| have trouble fitting in with others.

1372
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:56,753
But because of what you had said,

1373
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:59,756
| thought maybe it was
okay for me to be myself.

1374
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:01,924
Your words were what
put my mind at ease.

1375
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:03,968
And so I managed to go back to school.

1376
01:11:04,135 --> 01:11:06,971
So, you see, you were
the one that saved me.

1377
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:10,558
- My words actually did that?

1378
01:11:12,435 --> 01:11:14,145
Then maybe I can save people.

1379
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:18,775
Thank you, Yoko.

1380
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:19,984
I'll do it.

1381
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:21,152
I'll do my best.

1382
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:24,113
- Gotta go.

1383
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,531
Shift's about to start.

1384
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:26,491
When you're done with the coffee,

1385
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:28,743
just bring the stuff back to the cafe.

1386
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:30,328
- [Kawamura] Uh...

1387
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:34,832
- [Yoko] I've been in love with you

1388
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:36,709
ever since you
said those things to me.

1389
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:39,587
| love you more than anyone I know!

1390
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:43,174
So you'd better
do your best, you idiot!

1391
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:51,474
(Kawamura sighs)

1392
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:57,230
-You'll call for help,
alert emergency services,

1393
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:59,857
and don't forget to
bring the AED with you.

1394
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:02,360
First, check if they're
conscious by talking to them

1395
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:03,820
to see if they respond.

1396
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,530
Can you hear me?

1397
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:06,614
Can you hear me?

1398
01:12:07,532 --> 01:12:09,283
Can you hear me?

1399
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:12,453
If there's no response, check
to see if they're breathing.

1400
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:13,788
Next, compressions.

1401
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:18,835
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1402
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:21,963
Place one hand on top of the
other, using your body weight.

1403
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:25,466
Adults need at least 30
five-centimeter-deep compressions.

1404
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:27,176
Remember to wait until the chest rises

1405
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:28,761
before compressing, 29, 30.

1406
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:32,473
Tilt their head, pinch their
nose, and support their chin.

1407
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:37,645
Aim for one breath per second, repeat.

1408
01:12:37,812 --> 01:12:40,481
Make sure their chest is
expanding when you're doing this.

1409
01:12:40,648 --> 01:12:43,276
After that, start the
chest compressions again.

1410
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:47,947
Five, six, seven, 30,
that's the pattern.

1411
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:49,824
Okay, who wants to give it a go?

1412
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:51,993
Miss Mukaimizu?

1413
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:55,288
(Hinako gasps)

1414
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:58,374
(Hinako inhales deeply)

1415
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:01,711
- One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1416
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,921
-You might be
pressing a bit too hard.

1417
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:05,798
You don't have to press hard.

1418
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:07,592
Five centimeters is fine.

1419
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:09,594
Let's try mouth to mouth next.

1420
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:13,514
(Hinako whimpers)

1421
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,521
(Hinako gasping)

1422
01:13:20,688 --> 01:13:21,814
Miss Mukaimizu?

1423
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:23,065
Miss Mukaimizu.

1424
01:13:24,942 --> 01:13:27,695
(Hinako panting)

1425
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:38,289
> There you J)
(Hinako groaning)

1426
01:13:38,456 --> 01:13:39,373
| shouldn't!

1427
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:42,585
(people chattering)

1428
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:44,962
- You shoot 'em off the roof
like they do for New Years

1429
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:46,422
in Taiwan and Shanghai.

1430
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:47,506
- Really?
- Are you serious?

1431
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:49,467
-Things got out of hand last time,

1432
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:51,928
so we're bringing a
fireworks expert with us.

1433
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,305
You'll wanna have earplugs.
- Sounds like a blast.

1434
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:57,892
- Minoru got nabbed by the
cops, but this guy ran away.

1435
01:13:58,059 --> 01:14:00,353
- [Woman] You guys
just left him there?

1436
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:01,187
- [Man In Green Shirt] Well,
lucky I didn't get caught

1437
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:03,856
or you wouldn't have an
explosive show to see tonight.

1438
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:06,233
In fact, I think you
should be thanking me.

1439
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,778
- [Woman] You want a
gold star or something?

1440
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:10,655
- [Man] I know the
perfect abandoned tower.

1441
01:14:10,821 --> 01:14:11,864
- [Woman] Do you mean the OST?

1442
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:13,366
It's, like, famous.

1443
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:15,409
It's where they had the
world's biggest Christmas tree.

1444
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:16,869
- [Man] That tree's still
there, you know.

1445
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:18,204
- [Woman] It's super tall.

1446
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:19,121
- [Man In Green Shirt] So the plan

1447
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:22,124
is to launch them from there.
- This is gonna be epic.

1448
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,709
- [Man In Green Shirt] You
don't know the half of it.

1449
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:25,628
- [Man] I am so fired up.

1450
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:27,254
- [Woman] That was such a dad joke.

1451
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:29,173
- Yeah, that was pretty bad.
- What are we waiting for?

1452
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:30,216
- [Woman] I can't wait.

1453
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:32,134
- [Woman] It's my first
time, you know.

1454
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:33,511
- [Man In Green Shirt]
It's gonna be real loud.

1455
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:34,553
Don't say I didn't warn ya.

1456
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,555
You go kinda deaf afterwards.

1457
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:38,474
- [Woman] Wait, I don't
have any earplugs.

1458
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:39,308
- [Man] No worries, babe.

1459
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:40,267
| got extra.
- Hi, Yoko, what's up.

1460
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:42,186
- Shh.
- Can I have pair now?

1461
01:14:42,353 --> 01:14:44,146
- [Man] I think she's
trying to shut you out.

1462
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:46,399
- Ah, don't be mean.
- I'm gonna hold you to that.

1463
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:51,487
(group chattering)
(suspenseful music)

1464
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:03,290
(door bells tinkling)

1465
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:06,002
- Boss, I'm clocking out for the day.

1466
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:07,211
- Where are you going?

1467
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:09,714
- [Yoko] Remember when
about a year ago,

1468
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,633
some illegal fireworks set
that construction site on fire?

1469
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,719
- [Hinako] Yeah, I was actually
living in the apartments

1470
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:15,803
next to that building.

1471
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:17,388
- What, really?

1472
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:19,265
Well, I think those are
the guys who did it.

1473
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:22,727
They were talking about
launching more fireworks.

1474
01:15:22,893 --> 01:15:25,438
And they're planning on
sneaking up to OST to do it.

1475
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:28,107
-The place with the
humongous Christmas tree?

1476
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:31,318
- Damn it, can't reach Wasabi.

1477
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:33,612
They're going to break in
to launch the fireworks

1478
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:35,114
and they're illegal ones too.

1479
01:15:38,826 --> 01:15:40,286
- Yoko, this is serious.

1480
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:41,287
We should call the police.

1481
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:44,290
(group chattering)

1482
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:52,089
Listen, I'm gonna go
call the cops, okay?

1483
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:53,841
- We need proof first.

1484
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:55,426
I'm gonna get a photo of these jerks.

1485
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:58,262
(dramatic music)

1486
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:02,475
- Yoko.

1487
01:16:05,186 --> 01:16:06,020
Hey, Yoko.

1488
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:09,315
Where'd you go?

1489
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:13,819
Whoa, it's huge.

1490
01:16:15,362 --> 01:16:17,531
Looks pretty dead, though.

1491
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:20,034
Yoko, wait.

1492
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:21,202
- [Yoko] Shh!

1493
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:30,419
That was a pool.

1494
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:36,175
- Oh, check it out.
- This is so sick.

1495
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:39,386
- [Man In Green Shirt] I told
you guys it was gonna be awesome.

1496
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:41,514
You can see the whole
town from up here.

1497
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,641
- Amazing.
- Look at all the lights.

1498
01:16:43,808 --> 01:16:47,144
- [Woman] (giggling) Wow.

1499
01:16:47,311 --> 01:16:49,105
We're so high up.
- Nice view.

1500
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:50,815
(woman gasps)
- Oh.

1501
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:53,109
- [Woman] That was so mean.

1502
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:55,152
- We can set the fireworks
off from right here.

1503
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:56,612
- You ready?
- Hold on.

1504
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:57,988
What you think you're doing?

1505
01:16:58,155 --> 01:16:59,156
(women yelping)

1506
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:02,284
-That wasn't funny.
- What the hell, you idiot?

1507
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:04,870
- All right, grab one and get ready.

1508
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:06,122
Come and get it.

1509
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:09,125
(group chattering)

1510
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:14,213
- I can't get a clear shot.

1511
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:15,840
Crap, it's just too dark.

1512
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:17,800
- I think you already
have enough proof.

1513
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:19,844
- I wanna catch them
actually doing it.

1514
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:23,139
- Oh.

1515
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,686
- [Man] Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

1516
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:31,188
- Fireworks

1517
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:32,356
- Is that Katsura?

1518
01:17:32,523 --> 01:17:34,024
(fireworks popping)
(both gasping)

1519
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:34,900
That's bad.

1520
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:37,695
(fireworks whistling)

1521
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:39,238
(fireworks popping)

1522
01:17:39,405 --> 01:17:44,285
(crowd cheering)
(bright music)

1523
01:18:09,768 --> 01:18:12,563
(crowd clamoring)

1524
01:18:14,732 --> 01:18:17,109
- [Man] Let's get out of here!

1525
01:18:17,276 --> 01:18:17,902
- [Yoko] Hey, morons!

1526
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:19,945
That's why you don't set
off illegal fireworks

1527
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:21,906
in abandoned buildings!

1528
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:23,157
- What was that?

1529
01:18:23,324 --> 01:18:25,367
I can't hear you.

1530
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:26,702
- [Yoko] I think I got
hit by one of the sparks.

1531
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:28,245
- We have to get out of here.

1532
01:18:31,248 --> 01:18:32,416
We can't go back the way we came.

1533
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:34,376
We're going to have to jump, okay?

1534
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:38,339
(both groaning)

1535
01:18:38,505 --> 01:18:40,132
- My leg hurts bad.

1536
01:18:40,299 --> 01:18:45,221
(fireworks popping)
(dramatic music)

1537
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:48,849
- Oh.

1538
01:18:49,016 --> 01:18:50,684
YOKO HINAGESHI: MISSED CALL
YOKO: I'M WITH HINAKO...

1539
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,521
(Kawamura gasps)

1540
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:56,148
(alarm beeping)

1541
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:57,733
- [Fire Center Operator]
Fire reported in Nagakawa.

1542
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,985
20th Street Number 9, third
block of the Nishikubo District.

1543
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:02,238
- Mr. Yamashiro, it's east of the OST.

1544
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:03,656
And the closest hydrant's been moved

1545
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:05,950
30 meters south of
the new mansion block.

1546
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:06,784
- You sure?

1547
01:19:06,951 --> 01:19:07,618
- Yes.

1548
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:09,370
The girl I like is in danger.

1549
01:19:09,536 --> 01:19:11,455
- Wait, what?
(siren blaring)

1550
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:12,873
- Our ladders aren't
gonna be tall enough.

1551
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:16,877
And if that tree catches fire,
it'll be a towering inferno.

1552
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:20,047
(fireworks rumbling)

1553
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:24,218
(siren wailing)

1554
01:19:29,223 --> 01:19:31,141
Damn, fireworks again?

1555
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:31,976
Grab the hose.

1556
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:33,185
We'll have to use the stairs.

1557
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:35,104
Get up as high as you can.
- Roger.

1558
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:36,230
- [Deputy Lieutenant] Search for 252s

1559
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:40,234
on the 15th and other floors.
- Yes, sir.

1560
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:41,777
- [Firefighter] The steel
door is locked.

1561
01:19:41,944 --> 01:19:44,196
We'll have to cut through it.

1562
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,660
How did they get in there?

1563
01:19:49,827 --> 01:19:51,537
- I think I found
how they gained entry.

1564
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:52,746
We're going in now.

1565
01:19:52,913 --> 01:19:54,498
(Kawamura panting)

1566
01:19:54,665 --> 01:19:56,667
- [Kawamura] Is anyone in here?

1567
01:19:56,834 --> 01:19:58,919
Shout if you can hear us!

1568
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:02,214
(fireworks rumbling)
(fireworks whistling)

1569
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:06,218
- 13th floor, the stairwell's
inaccessible, too many sparks.

1570
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:08,470
We cannot go higher, over.

1571
01:20:10,014 --> 01:20:12,516
Shit, put your face guards on!

1572
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:15,811
- [Kawamura] Captain,
we've got no water.

1573
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:16,729
- What?

1574
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,940
Wait here, I'll check it out.

1575
01:20:21,942 --> 01:20:23,902
- [Commander] We've yet
to rescue any civilians.

1576
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:25,571
The 14th and 15th floor stairwells

1577
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:27,448
are currently engulfed in flames.

1578
01:20:27,614 --> 01:20:30,159
No other 252s on any other floors.

1579
01:20:30,326 --> 01:20:32,786
Reports indicate there
were 10 people on the roof.

1580
01:20:32,953 --> 01:20:34,079
We're still trying to locate them.

1581
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:35,456
(water hissing)

1582
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:38,542
(Kawamura grunting)

1583
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,936
(Kawamura screaming)

1584
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,736
- It's okay, I made a call.

1585
01:21:05,903 --> 01:21:08,238
The fire department's downstairs now.

1586
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:10,074
They'll be here to save us real soon.

1587
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:13,952
(fireworks popping)
(Yoko whimpers)

1588
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:18,374
If I call on Minato now,
he might disappear forever.

1589
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:22,920
- [Minato] If you need
my help, just call, 'kay?

1590
01:21:23,087 --> 01:21:23,921
- [Hinako] I can't.

1591
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:25,506
If I do that, you'll--

1592
01:21:25,672 --> 01:21:28,884
- [Yoko] (whimpers) Minato.

1593
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:31,303
- [Kawamura] Minato will
never be able to be at peace

1594
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:32,930
if you do not move on.

1595
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:36,600
- [Hinako] Minato said
that what he wanted.

1596
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:39,019
- [Minato] Until you're able
to ride those waves alone,

1597
01:21:39,186 --> 01:21:40,938
you can call on me whenever you need.

1598
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:49,113
D> There you are )

1599
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:51,490
> Out on the water )

1600
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:56,412
D I can see your smiling
face reflect back at me )

1601
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:57,996
- [Minato] Hinako, did
you need something?

1602
01:21:58,163 --> 01:22:01,125
- Minato.
- My wish came true.

1603
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:02,167
I'm still here.

1604
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:03,419
| got to stay.

1605
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:06,505
My wish is and has
always been the same,

1606
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:08,173
that I'll be here for you.

1607
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:11,093
- [Minato and Hinako] Until
you can ride your wave.

1608
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:16,181
(water hissing)
(bright music)

1609
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:07,483
- [Minato] You've really improved.

1610
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:09,067
- [Kawamura] Minato?

1611
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:10,986
- [Minato] I'm proud
to call you my friend.

1612
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:14,823
There are two more on the top
floors, but I'll get them.

1613
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:16,575
- [Kawamura] Minato!

1614
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:31,089
(fireworks popping)

1615
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:33,550
-The fireworks can no longer ignite.

1616
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:35,802
And there's a column of water
traveling up the old tree,

1617
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:36,803
dousing its branches.

1618
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:39,181
But how, I couldn't say.

1619
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:44,520
(fireworks popping)
(fire crackling)

1620
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:45,354
- Listen up.

1621
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:47,356
We're going under the water,
but don't worry, it's safe.

1622
01:23:47,523 --> 01:23:48,190
(Yoko inhales)

1623
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:50,859
You'll get to see your brother.

1624
01:23:53,737 --> 01:23:56,740
- [Minato] How's my little
blue-ringed octopus?

1625
01:23:56,907 --> 01:24:00,244
- [Yoko] Minato? (mumbling)

1626
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:03,080
- [Minato] Say hi to
Mom and Dad for me.

1627
01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:05,832
(Yoko mumbling)

1628
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:16,051
(both gasping)

1629
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:18,971
- [Hinako] Come on, Yoko, this way.

1630
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:21,640
(both panting)

1631
01:24:33,235 --> 01:24:34,069
Right.

1632
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:36,405
Left.

1633
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:41,910
(bright music)

1634
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:42,828
Right.

1635
01:24:44,413 --> 01:24:45,539
Left.

1636
01:24:45,706 --> 01:24:48,625
We gotta go under, hold your breath.

1637
01:24:51,545 --> 01:24:53,589
- [Minato] When the water
has extinguished the fire,

1638
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:55,591
it'll spill out like a giant wave.

1639
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:02,723
Once you surface, you're
gonna have to ride that wave.

1640
01:25:02,889 --> 01:25:05,601
Yoko, hold on to the
board and don't let go.

1641
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:07,644
Get ready, I see the top.

1642
01:25:11,815 --> 01:25:14,735
You're almost there, one, two, three.

1643
01:25:16,737 --> 01:25:19,281
(both gasping)

1644
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:23,535
(Yoko screaming)

1645
01:25:23,702 --> 01:25:25,537
Hinako, paddle, paddle.

1646
01:25:27,831 --> 01:25:28,582
(Hinako gasps)

1647
01:25:28,749 --> 01:25:30,500
Pop up, ride the wave.

1648
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:39,217
(wave roaring)

1649
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:48,477
(Hinako yelps)

1650
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:41,405
(bright music)

1651
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:54,292
(both groaning)

1652
01:26:58,588 --> 01:27:00,841
- [Hinako] Thank you, Yoko.

1653
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:17,774
(both giggling)

1654
01:27:34,624 --> 01:27:37,043
- [Minato] Thank you, Hinako.

1655
01:27:39,129 --> 01:27:40,380
You're my hero.

1656
01:27:49,556 --> 01:27:50,390
- Hinako.

1657
01:27:51,767 --> 01:27:53,018
Thank goodness.

1658
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:22,047
- [Hinako] Thanks for
celebrating Christmas with me.

1659
01:28:22,214 --> 01:28:25,383
- We couldn't miss celebrating
your lifeguard certification.

1660
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:28,678
But are you sure you
wanna do it with omurice?

1661
01:28:28,845 --> 01:28:30,305
- I've always celebrated with omurice

1662
01:28:30,472 --> 01:28:31,681
ever since I was a kid.

1663
01:28:31,848 --> 01:28:33,225
Even though I've
never really been able

1664
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:34,768
to make it very well.

1665
01:28:34,935 --> 01:28:36,561
But I have been practicing,

1666
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:39,397
and recently I've gotten a tad better.

1667
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:40,941
- Wait, really?

1668
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:43,735
- [Kawamura] Lifeguard
and omurice master.

1669
01:28:43,902 --> 01:28:45,570
It looks like you've
tackled life's waves.

1670
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:46,488
- That's right.

1671
01:28:46,655 --> 01:28:49,199
I'm riding the waves, this
time on and off the shore.

1672
01:28:49,366 --> 01:28:51,868
You could say I'm surfing
my way through life.

1673
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:53,954
(Kawamura and Yoko chuckling)

1674
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:56,832
- I'm sure my brother's
smiling down on us.

1675
01:28:56,998 --> 01:28:58,250
Oh, reminds me.

1676
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,754
4 MEN ARRESTED OVER "OST RUINS" FIRE
They finally caught those bastards.

1677
01:29:02,879 --> 01:29:04,840
- [Kawamura] (chuckles)
Okay, enough detective stuff.

1678
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:06,383
- Fine, I got it.

1679
01:29:07,717 --> 01:29:08,718
- [Hinako] Thanks for dinner.

1680
01:29:08,885 --> 01:29:09,719
- [Kawamura] My pleasure.

1681
01:29:09,886 --> 01:29:12,347
Congratulations again.
- Yeah, congrats.

1682
01:29:15,475 --> 01:29:17,519
- Hey, you wanna check out Port Tower?

1683
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:19,729
They have a lover's sanctuary inside.

1684
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:20,897
- [Yoko] What's that?

1685
01:29:21,064 --> 01:29:22,107
- And they have these heart cards

1686
01:29:22,274 --> 01:29:24,192
that you can write messages on.

1687
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:25,861
- Sounds lame.

1688
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:28,154
- Nah, sounds romantic.
- Huh?

1689
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:29,990
- If you wanna go Wasabi,

1690
01:29:30,156 --> 01:29:32,534
| don't mind giving you some company.

1691
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:33,994
- [Hinako] (gasps) You
two should go together.

1692
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:35,996
- Oh, you think so?

1693
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:39,249
- Uh, but--
- Don't worry about me.

1694
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:40,959
I'm feeling kinda tired.
- Okay.

1695
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:43,086
- Great, we're gonna check it out.

1696
01:29:43,253 --> 01:29:45,380
Come on, Wasabi.
(Kawamura groaning)

1697
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:46,298
- See you later.

1698
01:29:46,464 --> 01:29:47,799
Bye, Happy New Year.

1699
01:29:47,966 --> 01:29:50,510
- Hinako, Merry Christmas.

1700
01:29:50,677 --> 01:29:52,804
Not falling in love is
something only idiots do.

1701
01:29:52,971 --> 01:29:54,431
(Kawamura chuckling)

1702
01:29:54,598 --> 01:29:57,058
(gentle music)

1703
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:04,983
D> There you are )

1704
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:07,986
> Out on the water )

1705
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:13,450
(Hinako crying)

1706
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:20,415
- [Announcer] This message
is from Minato Hinageshi,

1707
01:30:20,582 --> 01:30:23,627
and it goes out to Hinako Mukaimizu.

1708
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:25,545
It was submitted exactly a year ago.

1709
01:30:25,712 --> 01:30:26,796
NEXT YEAR'S CHRISTMAS MESSAGE BOX

1710
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:29,132
Merry Christmas, Hinako.

1711
01:30:29,299 --> 01:30:32,218
Let's spend every Christmas
together from this day forward

1712
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:37,182
forever and ever and ever.
(Hinako sobbing)

1713
01:30:37,349 --> 01:30:40,268
This next message is
for Tatsuya Shibasaki

1714
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:42,270
from his whole family.
(Hinako wailing)

1715
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:43,480
Merry Christmas.

1716
01:30:43,647 --> 01:30:46,816
What a year it's been, but
thank you for everything.

1717
01:30:46,983 --> 01:30:48,151
And Happy New Year.

1718
01:30:48,318 --> 01:30:49,361
I also have a message from Miyu
Watanabe to Koichi Watanabe.

1719
01:30:59,663 --> 01:31:02,499
(waves whooshing)

1720
01:31:11,591 --> 01:31:13,969
- [Hinako] Hi, guys. (chuckling)

1721
01:31:14,135 --> 01:31:17,263
There's a rip current around
here, so be careful, okay?

1722
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:19,140
- Okay.
- Got it.

1723
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:20,600
- Hinako's the best.

1724
01:31:25,522 --> 01:31:27,023
- [Surfer] I guess there's
no more waves today.

1725
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:27,941
- Let's bail.

1726
01:31:43,623 --> 01:31:46,167
