1
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:07,215
(static crackling)

2
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:12,137
(wind rustling)

3
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:29,863
- Where am I?

4
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,115
Where is everyone?

5
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,417
(gun bangs)

6
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:49,090
(guns banging)

7
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,474
(soft twinkling music)

8
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,654
- Hey, Remy.

9
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:14,239
Stick close to us or we'll lose you.

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,240
- Where are we?

11
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:17,785
- Who knows?

12
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,121
- [Remy] Where are we going?

13
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,122
- Can't say.

14
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,626
It's nothing new for us.

15
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,135
(crow squawks)

16
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,561
(uplifting music)

17
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,380
(soft music)

18
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,465
- Where am I?

19
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,441
(fly buzzing)

20
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,003
Where...

21
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,213
Oh, yeah.

22
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,175
That hotel in the city we found.

23
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,887
I got a single.

24
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,264
Now it's coming back.

25
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,477
(water rushing)

26
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,981
(Remy yelps)

27
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,274
Huh?

28
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,275
What?

29
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,198
No water again?

30
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,659
This is certainly no planet for girls.

31
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,506
(Remy yawns)

32
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,266
(bell tolling)

33
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,529
(ominous music)

34
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,378
Wonder if the others are up yet.

35
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,634
(helicopter blades whirring)

36
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,762
- [Reporter] And the criminals
who robbed the City 13 branch

37
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,806
of the Three Mark Bank at 2:20

38
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,558
continue their flight from justice

39
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,644
in three air cars containing the hostages

40
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,273
and 3.4 billion in gold bullion.

41
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,237
(sirens wailing)

42
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,115
All city expressways have been locked off

43
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,368
with civilian traffic far from access.

44
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:32,999
Because of this,

45
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,084
city traffic is backed
up for five kilometers

46
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,503
with no relief in sight.

47
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,671
The criminals are believed

48
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,590
to be carrying heavy weaponry

49
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:45,093
leaving the patrol cars in a
cautious pursuit behind them.

50
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:45,928
Oh!

51
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,054
Oh dear! (screams)

52
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,974
(static crackling)

53
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:59,233
(Remy sighs)
(horns honking)

54
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,694
- [Remy] Had to happen today, didn't it?

55
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,865
What do I do?

56
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,493
I'll never make it at this rate.

57
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,288
And the expressways are practically empty.

58
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,415
That's right.

59
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,959
I don't have much time left.

60
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,879
To hell with this.

61
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,257
Let's go.

62
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,550
(car thuds)

63
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,551
Sorry.

64
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,444
(police radio chatters)

65
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,780
- Huh?

66
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,032
- Stop! Stop!

67
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,033
Hey, stop!

68
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:52,953
God!

69
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,624
- What's that?

70
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,167
- It looks like a freeway ticket.

71
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,961
At least he's not trying
to sneak a free ride.

72
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,379
(police officer groans)

73
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,880
- What the hell's the matter with you?

74
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:08,261
After him!

75
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:14,225
- [Officer] License plate
reads S-E-E-Y-O-U-A-G-A-I-N.

76
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,684
Got the owner.

77
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,478
Remy Shimada.

78
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,355
A woman!

79
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,772
- [Officer 2] Remy Shimada.

80
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,900
Traveled space as a member
of the GoShogun Team.

81
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,570
Winner of the Galaxy Award for Valor.

82
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,530
Refused acceptance.

83
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,284
(sirens wailing)

84
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,506
- [Officer] Great technique.

85
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,467
You think she'd give me her autograph?

86
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,135
- [Officer 2] Kinda doubt it.

87
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:50,970
- [Officer] Doesn't even look like

88
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,722
she likes getting her picture taken.

89
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,557
- [Officer 2] This photo's pretty old.

90
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,975
- [Officer] A woman of mystery.

91
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,352
- [Officer 2] You think so?

92
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,733
She turned down the
Galaxy Award 40 years ago.

93
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,859
- [Officer] 40 years?

94
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,152
You mean...

95
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,446
- [Officer 2] The Remy
Shimada driving that car

96
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,365
is over 70 years old.

97
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,993
(upbeat music)

98
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,244
- Out of the way.
(horn honks)

99
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,245
Come on!

100
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,461
(gun banging rapidly)

101
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,004
Give me a break, will you?

102
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,881
I'm just in a hurry.

103
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,800
I don't have any beef with you guys.

104
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,431
(groans) I was gonna get a
good price for this thing!

105
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,022
Okay, if that's the way you want it.

106
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,777
(upbeat music continues)

107
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,957
(gun banging rapidly)

108
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,798
(explosion booms)

109
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,684
(sirens wailing)

110
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:21,685
One down.

111
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:25,898
And the next one.

112
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,657
(glass shatters)

113
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,628
(tires squealing)

114
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,885
- [Officer] We got the perps and recovered

115
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,304
all the hostages too.

116
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,931
- [Officer 2] Damn! What a woman!

117
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,735
- Swell.

118
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,113
Better put out that fire on my ass.

119
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,087
I guess I'm not gonna make it.

120
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:34,257
(Remy gasps)

121
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,092
(tires squealing)

122
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,092
Look out!

123
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,393
(somber music)

124
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,361
Mamma?

125
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,613
Where is this place?

126
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,614
Where am I?

127
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,550
Mamma?

128
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,303
Mamma?

129
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,554
(man grunts)

130
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:22,723
- Who's the kid?

131
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,560
- [Mother] Remy, didn't I
tell you not to come here?

132
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,687
- But, uh...

133
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,688
But...

134
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,817
(man grunts)

135
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,695
- This little one's yours, huh?

136
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,780
Mm.

137
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,574
She's gonna be a real
looker when she grows up.

138
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,284
- Get away from her!

139
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,161
She'll never have to sell herself!

140
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,287
- What the hell are you doing?

141
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,874
(mother gasps)

142
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,251
(man gasps)

143
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,252
- Your time's up.

144
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,004
Pay and get out and
leave my daughter alone!

145
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,465
- I ain't coming back.

146
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,678
(door slams)

147
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,014
(Remy sobs)

148
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:14,400
- [Mother] Remy, Mamma
has more work to do.

149
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,485
Buy something nice for yourself

150
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,654
and wait for me at home.

151
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,535
(Remy sniffling)

152
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,290
- That was the first and last time

153
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,293
Mother ever gave me pocket money.

154
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:39,466
One chocolate crepe and 10
sweet broiled chestnuts later,

155
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,467
it was gone.

156
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,763
I don't even remember how they tasted.

157
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,642
And there was Mother's
death not long after that.

158
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,024
These are the only memories
I have left of her.

159
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,487
(bell dings)

160
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,512
(soft music)

161
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,639
- [Killy] We meet again, Shingo.

162
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,142
- [Shingo] Yeah. God, Killy, 40 years.

163
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,105
- I'd forgotten just how
much time had passed.

164
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,362
You want one?

165
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,531
- No smoking in the museum.

166
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,034
So how long have you been smoking, anyway?

167
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,830
- [Killy] The day we stopped fighting

168
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,834
was the day there stopped
being any point to not smoking.

169
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,338
Jesus.

170
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:05,093
You mean you and she never
got it together in 40 years?

171
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,887
- [Shingo] Look who's talking,
you second-rate Casanova.

172
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,850
There was never anything between
Remy and me, to my regret.

173
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,686
- [Killy] We never had anything either.

174
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,647
What a couple of jerks we are,

175
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,066
wasting poor Remy like that.

176
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,319
The only ones left are
his royal Bundle-ness

177
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,487
and the other two.

178
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,323
- [Shingo] Looks like those
three won't be coming today.

179
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,741
- But Remy.

180
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:32,078
What would get her to
call us out here now?

181
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,079
- I don't know.

182
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,082
Anyway, she's late.

183
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,670
(monitor beeping)

184
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,676
(machine whooshing)

185
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,221
- [Doctor] She has no relatives?

186
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,557
- [Officer] Yeah, and
her house was locked up

187
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,392
like she was a hermit or something.

188
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,061
- What about her hospital expenses?

189
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,730
- No savings account at all.

190
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,857
- But she was the winner
of the Galaxy Award.

191
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,942
Can't the government cover it?

192
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,445
- Well, she never actually accepted

193
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,489
and she hasn't had anything to
do with the government since.

194
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,408
- What about health insurance coverage?

195
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,035
- [Officer] Defaulted on the premiums.

196
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,162
- Huh, so who is going
to pay for the treatment

197
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,956
we've already given her up till now?

198
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,378
- At 6:30 will be dinner
with the president

199
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,380
of the All World Banking Union.

200
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,175
You'll be discussing
financing for the coming year.

201
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,968
At 7:30 will be a party hosted

202
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:32,305
by the Fishery, Agriculture,
and Industrial Unions.

203
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,681
They request you make a 20 minute speech.

204
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,352
(phone ringing)

205
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,606
President's office.

206
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,776
Sir, phone call for you.

207
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,277
- [Kernagul] From who?

208
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,487
- A hospital apparently.

209
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,488
- Hospital?

210
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,782
Yeah?

211
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,367
What is it?

212
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,202
What?

213
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,661
Hospital costs?

214
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,329
We've got a company health plan.

215
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,330
Just...

216
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,165
What do you mean she isn't even on it?

217
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,959
Why the devil should I pay for someone

218
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,835
who isn't even in my company?

219
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,880
This isn't a charity I'm running.

220
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,925
Huh? Galaxy Award?

221
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,762
The woman who turned it down.

222
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,934
Go and cancel everything
that's on my schedule tonight.

223
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:21,145
- But there's a round table meeting

224
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,563
with the president after the party.

225
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,440
- I don't care!
(secretary gasps)

226
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,441
- Yes, sir.

227
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,196
- Remy's been injured.

228
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,032
(soft music)

229
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,617
- [Killy] Closing time.

230
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,119
End of show.

231
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,745
Curtain falls.

232
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:38,706
- [Shingo] You'd drop the curtain

233
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,206
before the heroin's entrance?

234
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:43,126
- [Woman] Mr. Shingo Hojo
and Mr. Killy Gagley?

235
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,210
- [Shingo] Yes?

236
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,253
- [Woman] I have a message for you

237
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,172
from the president of Kernagul Fried.

238
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,050
Miss Remy Shimada cannot join you today.

239
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,051
- Huh?

240
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:58,267
(monitor beeping)
(machine whooshing)

241
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,442
- In here.

242
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,444
- So, how is she?

243
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,114
(Kernagul grunts)

244
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,500
- The examination revealed a problem

245
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,462
in addition to the wounds
she received in the accident.

246
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,256
Progressive Leuko-Isolation Syndrome.

247
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,050
- Leuko-Isolation Syndrome.

248
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,801
- If we'd known about it earlier

249
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,387
we could've done something to correct it.

250
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,222
Look here.

251
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,849
It spread throughout her body.

252
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:43,978
As it is, she has a 5%
chance for recovery.

253
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,397
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

254
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,234
Well, taking into account the accident,

255
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,903
I'd give her two days.

256
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,112
(all gasp)
- Huh? What?

257
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,031
Two days?

258
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:56,240
You just said she had a 5% chance.

259
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,077
- That's true, if we
got hold of a specialist

260
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,913
at the City University Hospital.

261
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,334
But relations between the Central Hospital

262
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,545
and the University
Hospital aren't that great

263
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,339
and her injuries are very serious.

264
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,467
If we moved her, she'd
die within the hour.

265
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,302
(doctor yelps)

266
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,845
- Then I suggest you call the guy

267
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:21,224
at the University Hospital
right now, doctor.

268
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,767
- Hey, stop it. Don't kill him.

269
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,436
He's the only hope for treatment.

270
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,980
(doctor grunts)

271
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,649
(doctor coughs)

272
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,318
- There's just too much red tape.

273
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,737
It'd be different if we
had an official order

274
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,115
from the Surgeon General's office.

275
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,075
- Surgeon General?

276
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,369
(chuckles) The surgeon General?

277
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,037
(Kernagul laughs)

278
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:43,872
- What's with you?

279
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,124
- Our Surgeon General's
a man that the big wigs

280
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,418
on the Federation Council
know pretty damn well.

281
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,337
- You wouldn't mean...

282
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,255
- Oh yeah!

283
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:54,048
Mr. Caw-Caw Crow, the joker who accepted

284
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,883
the Galaxy Award with us.

285
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,344
- So where is he now?

286
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,682
(owl hoots)

287
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,441
(car thuds)
(Cuttnal grunts)

288
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,026
- Oh, Christ.

289
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,987
Why does my job have me bouncing around

290
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,447
these goddamned mountains?

291
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:26,498
(Cuttnal grunts)

292
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,337
Oh, Christ.

293
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,923
(crow squawks)

294
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,179
(peaceful music)

295
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,476
- Sun and moon are like travelers

296
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:50,397
moving for 100 generations to and fro.

297
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,691
Time passes unconcerned,

298
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,110
the starlight unchanging,

299
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:59,655
making the darkness to night
all the more beautiful.

300
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,991
The taste of Shadojima style somen noodles

301
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,326
is pleasing to my palate.

302
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,828
Yet I find the slim but firm Miwa style

303
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,163
much more suitable,

304
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,709
with Welsh onions the
only seasoning necessary.

305
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,048
- Bundle.

306
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,718
(Cuttnal sighs)

307
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,345
Somen isn't much of a meal by itself.

308
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,347
You should add some
fried eggs or ham to it,

309
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,515
just like I taught you.

310
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,561
- At least I'm not the one
eating cold Chinese food.

311
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,188
- Ah, don't be like that.

312
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,481
We're both getting old.

313
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,317
And that means we have to
eat well and cooperate.

314
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,444
Here, my friend, just sign this.

315
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,612
- [Bundle] And what is this?

316
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,405
- Only the title to this land.

317
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,573
Huh?

318
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,367
- I shan't help a corrupt politician

319
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,661
evict me from my own land.

320
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,745
- What the?

321
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,121
Don't be like that.

322
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,831
Despite what you think of me,

323
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,959
I am the Surgeon General.

324
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,544
I want to turn this into
a public health resort.

325
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,837
It has to be developed.

326
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:57,922
Be a pal.

327
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,757
What?

328
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,384
- This plot of nature is
never to be developed.

329
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,886
Now leave this place

330
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,137
while you can.
(Cuttnal screams)

331
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,640
- All right, all right,
all right, all right!

332
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,433
- [Bundle] That's better.

333
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,395
- Jesus Christ, if he
wasn't such an old friend,

334
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,355
I'd bulldoze this shack in a second.

335
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,982
You know I would.
- You'd what?

336
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,400
- Nothing! Nothing!

337
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,694
(laughs) You got good
ears for a man your age.

338
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,570
Ah hell, I'm the one
that's going deaf lately.

339
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,489
(machine ringing)

340
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,449
Huh?

341
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,950
It's for me.

342
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:26,785
Hello?

343
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,121
Well I'm kinda in the middle
of something right now.

344
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,584
Remy Shimada?

345
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,295
Yeah, I know her.

346
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,880
What, what? Uh-huh, yeah.

347
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,048
She's in critical?

348
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,675
You need my authorization?

349
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,343
Oh, there's no way I'll make it

350
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,679
down these mountains in two days.

351
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,680
- Cuttnal.
- Huh?

352
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,477
(peaceful music)

353
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,314
- Leave this to me.

354
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,698
The city's only 50 minutes
away at supersonic.

355
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,868
Sword and saber alone are
not enough in today's world.

356
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,495
This too is a requirement of the Samurai.

357
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,166
(ship whooshes)

358
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,474
(metal sparking)

359
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,821
- Even with the rain, it isn't any cooler.

360
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,742
Probably why the guys haven't
come out of their rooms.

361
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:53,163
(locket clicks)

362
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,209
A locket with no one inside.

363
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,923
(knocking on door)

364
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,885
Everyone gets tired of
being alone eventually.

365
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:08,720
(locket clicks)

366
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,890
Shingo, Killy, Kernagul, Cuttnal?

367
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,267
Or is it you, Bundle?

368
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:18,522
(soft twinkling music)

369
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,153
Yes?

370
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,531
- [Messenger] Here. This is for you.

371
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,866
- Why, thank you.

372
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,206
Wait!

373
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,624
Who sent this?

374
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,044
(soft music)

375
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:47,091
In two days you will be dead.

376
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,844
That is your destiny.

377
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:52,222
How you die is shown within.

378
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:07,945
In two days you will be dead.

379
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,781
How you die will be...

380
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,249
- [Cuttnal] Get that specialist
at University Hospital now

381
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,043
and tell him it's an order
from the Surgeon General.

382
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,712
(monitor beeping)
(machine whooshing)

383
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,465
- [Killy] Thanks,
Cuttnal. You've saved her.

384
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,466
- Well...

385
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,638
I don't think she'll be
able to pull through.

386
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:40,060
Remy's condition is progressively
getting worse as we speak,

387
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,645
even with the operation.

388
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,565
I only give her 1% chance of survival.

389
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,693
- 1%? Jesus.
- 1%?

390
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:48,694
- No.

391
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,448
Remy's spirit defies all the odds.

392
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,866
Her will to live itself

393
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:57,537
has always been a thing of
beauty, even now surely.

394
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,588
- (chuckles) What's wrong, Remy?

395
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,507
Don't you want it?

396
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:10,674
Just take off your dress.

397
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,510
- Yeah, come on.

398
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:12,927
Just take off your dress.

399
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:13,803
- Yeah, come on.

400
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:14,929
We'll buy it from you.

401
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,388
(bullies laughing)

402
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,973
Come on.

403
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:18,974
Just do it!

404
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,189
(bullies laughing)

405
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,735
(bullies gasp)

406
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,487
(upbeat music)

407
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,157
(fist thudding)

408
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,962
(bullies crying)

409
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,218
- Thanks, friends.

410
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:55,678
I'll just take this for my cleaning bill.

411
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,555
See ya!

412
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:57,889
- [Bully] Mommy!

413
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,898
(ominous music)

414
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,881
(Remy panting)

415
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,534
(Remy yelps)

416
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,721
(Remy yelping)

417
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,771
(Remy panting)

418
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,369
(Remy screams)

419
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:52,212
(ominous music continues)

420
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:10,354
- [Messenger] This will
be you in two days time.

421
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,857
You will die in the most shameful of ways,

422
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:17,986
ripped apart, body and soul, by strangers.

423
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,949
A baptism of blood awaits you.

424
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,541
- Well, thanks for the warning.

425
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,795
(water rushing)

426
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,506
What's that?

427
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:37,627
Did I forget to turn it off?

428
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,847
(Remy yelps)

429
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,858
(tense music)

430
00:28:58,778 --> 00:28:59,778
Real funny.

431
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:07,370
(upbeat music)

432
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:21,175
I don't mean to scare you
but I need to know something.

433
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,636
What are the guest room
water pipes connected to?

434
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,389
- The water tank on the roof.

435
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,390
- [Remy] Thanks.

436
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,598
- Remy, don't shoot!

437
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,479
There's no one up here.

438
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,523
- Except us, that is.

439
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,242
Nothing but water in there.

440
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,244
- Blood! Blood!

441
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,704
- I hate having blood
running all over the place.

442
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:33,665
Huh?

443
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,707
Oh, it's just you guys.

444
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,334
- [Killy] There isn't a
drop of blood up here.

445
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,419
- So you guys saw it too?

446
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,130
- Every one of us got
those bloody love letters.

447
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:45,300
It seems someone apparently
wants us all dead.

448
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,802
- A baptism of blood.

449
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,221
I'd prefer one of fine wine, thank you.

450
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,639
Perhaps a bordeaux.

451
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,476
(thunder crashes)

452
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:04,112
- Those who receive the
baptism will surely die.

453
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,948
You, in two days.

454
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:08,991
No one can escape their destiny.

455
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,784
It is written.

456
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:15,790
(pleasant music)
(Killy grunts)

457
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,766
(water dripping)

458
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,083
- [Bully] That's her.

459
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,835
She's the one who stole my money.

460
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,546
- [Bully's Mother] You
little tramp. How dare yoU!

461
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,965
I'm taking you to the police.

462
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:10,219
(Bully's mother yells)

463
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,099
(gentle music)

464
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,656
(Remy screams)

465
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,415
- Where is this?

466
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,667
Where am I?

467
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:46,255
(Remy whimpering)

468
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,805
(thunder crashes)

469
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,436
- [Officer] I understand your situation.

470
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,021
But it wouldn't do to raise a fuss

471
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,648
over this sort of thing.

472
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,816
- [Killy] This sorta thing?

473
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,194
- Quickly vanishing baptisms
of blood and letters of fate

474
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,405
are quite common things in this city.

475
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,115
- Like hell it's common.

476
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:16,910
You don't see that much blood
in boxing or pro wrestling.

477
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,286
- When death draws near,

478
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,706
everyone here receives a letter of fate

479
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,624
and the baptism of blood.

480
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:26,044
They then pray to God
and prepare their souls.

481
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,671
- Correct.

482
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:31,967
No man may change the fate God grants him.

483
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,512
Even to strangers like yourselves.

484
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,932
- Poppycock!

485
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,852
My medicines have saved
lots of people's lives.

486
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,729
I've changed people's fates!

487
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,982
(thunder crashes)

488
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,484
(Shingo gasps)

489
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,944
- Look out!

490
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:54,032
(chandelier crashes)

491
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,786
(Cuttnal groaning)

492
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,165
- You see that? He saved me.

493
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,833
Stuff that in your letters of fate

494
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,877
and smoke it, you old biddy.

495
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:10,797
- Your letter did not
decree your death this day.

496
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,216
Your destiny remains unchanged.

497
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,761
- Do not attempt to leave this hotel.

498
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,679
Our people do not take kindly

499
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,097
to those who defy fate.

500
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:21,684
(bell tolling)

501
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:29,191
- Sunset prayer is called.

502
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,235
Come. We must pray to God.

503
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:35,448
(ominous music)

504
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,794
- So now what?

505
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,379
- Wait, I'm pretty sure
he told us not to leave.

506
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,548
- Making that option
all the more appealing.

507
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,425
I'll pack.

508
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,760
- I was starting to go all out stir crazy

509
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,220
in that room anyway.

510
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,097
- Let's chase the blues away.

511
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,765
- I'm with you. Let's go.

512
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,352
(Remy giggles)

513
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,943
(pool balls rattling)

514
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,988
- [Cuttnal] Like the old woman said,

515
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:19,658
I'm supposed to die in four days.

516
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,284
- [Kernagul] Five days for me.

517
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,369
- [Killy] Three for me.

518
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,287
- Four.

519
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,872
I see no point in keeping a tally.

520
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:26,873
- Hmm.

521
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,586
Well, guys, looks like
I'll be the first to go.

522
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:32,421
That's good.

523
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:35,132
I wouldn't wanna be around
to see any of you die anyway.

524
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,050
- We won't let that happen, Remy.

525
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,969
- I've never had anything in my life.

526
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,012
Damned if I go out that way.

527
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,056
And neither will Remy if I can help it.

528
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,892
- I say we just blow this joint, right?

529
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,645
- That's with Remy, of course.

530
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,522
- Thanks, guys.

531
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,816
No, really. Thanks.

532
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,192
Oh, hell. Lighten up.

533
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,861
Let's make the best of this.

534
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,237
Bottoms up.

535
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,864
- [All] Cheers!

536
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,198
(glasses clink)

537
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,785
(smooth music)

538
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,671
- It's still too soon to
harvest this lovely rose.

539
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:44,744
- Huh?
- Huh?

540
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,084
- No mercy for those who
defy the God of fate.

541
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,294
- What do you say, guys?

542
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,087
You're a little early, aren't ya?

543
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,048
- Your fate will not change.

544
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,676
You will not die, no matter
how badly we beat you.

545
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:02,595
- I gotcha.

546
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:04,804
Sorta like a divine carte blanche.

547
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:07,016
- Well, we can cut loose without worrying.

548
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,352
- Extreme as always.

549
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:14,147
(smooth music continues)

550
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:17,442
- The only ones fated to
get beaten are you guys.

551
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:22,448
(all grunting)
(fists thudding)

552
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,450
- I haven't danced in ages.

553
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,535
(Remy chuckles)

554
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,996
Let's make a hot date hotter.

555
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,959
(Kernagul grunting)

556
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:44,303
- Why all the violence? (chuckles)

557
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,350
Are you all right?

558
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:50,934
Have some medicine, huh?

559
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:51,935
Here.

560
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,528
(laughs) Just my sleeping aids.

561
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:06,450
(all grunting)
(glass shattering)

562
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:09,453
- Pardon me.

563
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,996
Hope I didn't disturb your playing.

564
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,497
- Not at all, my dear.

565
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,834
A forte seemed quite
appropriate at that point.

566
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,172
- Your piano playing just makes me wanna

567
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:23,009
kick up my heels and dance.

568
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,148
- Hold on.

569
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:39,066
We are here for your protection.

570
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,279
(gun bangs)

571
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,995
Clear out, rioters.

572
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:55,249
(guns banging rapidly)

573
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:19,856
- This is insane!

574
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,358
You're cops and you act like that?

575
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,984
What's the matter with you?

576
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,946
- [Officer] We protect the
citizenry from rioters.

577
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,907
- [Killy] And I suppose
that this was their fate?

578
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:29,908
- Correct.

579
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,826
As you have your own fates to meet.

580
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:34,621
Until then, stay in your hotel

581
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,457
for the sake of civil
order, at the very least.

582
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,334
- Don't you worry one bit.

583
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:42,253
We're leaving your happy little city.

584
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,631
- There is no outside to this place.

585
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,591
You're now one of us.

586
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,260
No one can escape this city.

587
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:52,139
- Just as no one can escape
his destiny, Officer?

588
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,313
- Just as you say.

589
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,275
(sirens wailing)

590
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,880
- The whole city's our enemy.

591
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:28,675
- Somebody's pulling their
strings in the background.

592
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,176
- [Killy] That thing the worship?

593
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,970
- [Shingo] Probably.

594
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,096
- Do we take it down?

595
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,849
- There is no beauty in a hopeless battle.

596
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,225
- Then we just run like hell?

597
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,352
- Running's nothing new to me.

598
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,939
(Remy giggles)

599
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,655
(ominous music)

600
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,567
(Remy sighs)

601
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:34,365
(future Remy screams)

602
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:35,201
(Remy gasps)

603
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:38,037
(creature growls)

604
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,417
- This will be you in two days time.

605
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,004
- Disgusting!

606
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:56,555
(Remy groaning)
(creature growling)

607
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,813
(gun bangs)

608
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:09,108
- You won't be able to
kill it with bullets.

609
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:11,612
(gun banging)

610
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,494
I said you couldn't.

611
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:24,917
(blood squelching)

612
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,216
(bones crunching)

613
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,846
Now look at how you're going to die.

614
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,808
- Fine, I'll look.

615
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,893
It's your foolishness I see.

616
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,895
I don't know who you think you are,

617
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:46,980
but you won't win!

618
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,483
(fabric rips)

619
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:57,866
(future Remy groaning)

620
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,464
- Why don't you just give in?

621
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:14,674
You can't win.

622
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,927
Be patient. Just two more days.

623
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,439
(Remy moaning)

624
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:49,627
(soft music)

625
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:11,208
(basket rustling)

626
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:14,460
(cat meows)

627
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:17,047
(Remy giggles)

628
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:21,467
(Remy yells)

629
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:24,138
(Remy groaning)

630
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,612
(gun bangs)

631
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:03,385
- [Killy] Remy! Use the knife!

632
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,351
(Remy panting)

633
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,274
- Thank you, Killy.

634
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:19,817
- By the looks of things,

635
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:23,112
you're at least a century or
two ahead of these jokers.

636
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,947
- But why are you here?

637
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,491
- Well, you kinda tipped us off

638
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,367
when you jumped out your window.

639
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:31,245
You always had to have
your own way and go solo.

640
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,956
We figured it looked like
you could use our help.

641
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:38,377
Listen, Remy, please let us
protect you just for once

642
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,713
and no arguments.

643
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:43,133
- Look, I guess I just
like to pull my own weight.

644
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:48,346
- If you survive, then
maybe Mr Fate over there

645
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,515
won't look so tough.

646
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,727
And maybe I'll still
be alive in three days.

647
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,312
- [Remy] Killy.

648
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,524
- Come on. We're all together on this.

649
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,822
Looks like the party's coming our way.

650
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:06,823
- Mm-hmm.

651
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,498
- Hang on.

652
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:17,083
This gun's way too big for rapid fire.

653
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,585
If you shoot too much,
you'll hurt your hand.

654
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:20,753
- Yeah, I know.

655
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,755
But I'm used to it, really.

656
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:24,048
- Okay, get going.

657
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:26,425
I'll take care of everything here.

658
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:27,344
No, no, no.

659
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:28,761
I don't wanna hear another word.

660
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,639
Remember, I die in three days.

661
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,100
I'll catch you later.

662
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,436
- Mm-hmm. See ya.

663
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,151
- Come on.

664
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,169
(ominous music)

665
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:26,945
(dramatic music)

666
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,427
(Remy grunting)

667
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:32,843
(gun banging)

668
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:33,844
- Get away!

669
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:40,060
(tense music)

670
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,816
(gun bangs)

671
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,783
(gun bangs)

672
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,787
- Remy, now's your chance.

673
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:00,788
Get up here!

674
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:04,584
(gun banging)

675
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,263
- Shingo!
- You can thank me later.

676
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,355
(explosion booms)

677
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,940
These things aren't human.

678
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:29,693
We can't use normal tactics.

679
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,030
- [Remy] Where do they keep coming from?

680
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,867
- How long do you figure it'll
take them to get up here?

681
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,244
- As much as I'd like
them to take their time,

682
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,579
I'd say about a minute.

683
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,580
- It's enough.

684
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,545
(tense music continues)

685
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,886
- Over here, boys.

686
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,056
Good job on your graveyard shift.

687
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,182
Bye-bye!

688
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:04,143
(explosion booms)

689
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,562
Tough luck, guys.

690
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:09,274
(both grunting)

691
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,538
(both yelp)

692
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,044
They're persistent.

693
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,253
- Remy, run for it.

694
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,838
I can handle this by myself.

695
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:34,757
- No way. I'll stay and help.

696
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,177
- Don't be stupid and
make this all for nothing.

697
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:39,346
- But...

698
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:41,556
- I'm team leader and
that's a direct order.

699
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:45,018
Seems old habits are hard to break.

700
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:47,853
Go.

701
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:48,854
- Mm-hmm.

702
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,985
Shingo, thanks.

703
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,989
- This is all that I seem
to be good for anyway.

704
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,493
(gun banging)

705
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:13,713
(explosion booms)

706
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,977
- Better reload.

707
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,480
(Remy winces)

708
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:37,445
Did I overdo it with the gun?

709
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:41,115
I can't move my fingers.

710
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,618
(tense music)

711
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,610
On bicycles now?

712
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:20,488
I think I'm beginning to
lose this little footrace.

713
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,910
Well, considering I'm facing

714
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,578
a pretty nasty death anyway.

715
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:28,413
(gun bangs)

716
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:30,916
(Remy winces)

717
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:41,967
- Remy, get on.

718
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,180
Anymore fighting is quite pointless.

719
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:48,557
Don't waste your ammunition on them.

720
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,434
- Bundie, cool bike.

721
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,977
Where'd you get it?

722
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:53,270
- I borrowed it from the police.

723
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:55,147
My natural abilities at work.

724
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:57,942
- [Remy] Living up to your name, I see.

725
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:58,777
- It isn't stolen.

726
00:53:58,778 --> 00:54:00,986
Merely rented without
the benefit of paperwork.

727
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:01,987
- [Remy] Mm.

728
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,632
- We have to get out of this city.

729
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:24,176
The sooner the better off we'll be.

730
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:25,844
- What about the other guys?

731
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:27,555
- We still have some things to do.

732
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,935
(energetic music)

733
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,167
The exit!

734
00:54:57,168 --> 00:55:00,005
- And a big goddamn welcome wagon.

735
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,798
But they aren't attacking.

736
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:03,967
- Let's do it!

737
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:10,015
(audio warbles)

738
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,812
(Remy gasps)

739
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:34,247
(audio warbles)

740
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:49,220
- But that's impossible.

741
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:56,353
(guns clicking)

742
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,026
- You cannot leave this city.

743
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:07,112
It'll be the same every time you try.

744
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:09,698
Your only escape is when the god of fate

745
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,785
decrees that you sleep in that graveyard.

746
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:15,455
(ominous music)

747
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:49,364
(monitor beeping)

748
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:53,992
- [Doctor] You'd better
make the arrangements.

749
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:55,244
- [Nurse] Yes, Doctor.

750
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,538
- And keep it from that entourage of hers.

751
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:58,539
- Understood.

752
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:10,427
(heartbeat pounding)

753
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:17,015
- No one's coming.

754
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:18,016
No one's here.

755
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,269
- [Mysterious Voice] Right.

756
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,354
No one's coming.

757
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,314
No one's here.

758
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:26,150
- It's so quiet.

759
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,862
Yeah, Mamma's buried here too.

760
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,991
- [Mysterious Voice] Yes,
Mamma and I will be together.

761
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,369
- So I guess I'm gonna die.

762
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:38,746
- [Mysterious Voice] You will.

763
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:41,707
That was decided the day you were born.

764
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,251
- So, this is it.

765
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:45,628
- [Mysterious Voice] Yes.

766
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:48,297
There's no escape from this darkness.

767
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:51,800
It was decided from the beginning.

768
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:56,806
(soft music)
(bell tolling)

769
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:27,045
- So, tomorrow's the day.

770
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,393
At least I got water
today, thank goodness.

771
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:57,617
(Remy winces)

772
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,131
- It'll be tomorrow.

773
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,593
You're going to die.

774
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,474
Are you ignoring me?

775
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:25,727
- No, you wouldn't let me even if I tried.

776
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:28,313
But it's time for little
girls to be in bed.

777
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:31,775
Just take your precious
little pet and go home now.

778
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:34,194
- You will die in agony.

779
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:36,113
- Nighty-night, little girl.

780
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:39,117
(creature growling)

781
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:03,016
(soft twinkling music)

782
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,602
Seven rounds, huh?

783
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,856
I doubt that I'll even mange
to get six of them off.

784
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:48,685
An empty locket.

785
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:51,522
(uplifting music)

786
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:12,752
I would really hate to see it go to waste.

787
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:17,548
(soft music)

788
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:25,931
- [Shingo] In the end,
it's always this one.

789
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:28,725
- And in the end, I have nothing.

790
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,978
Nothing at all, no matter
how I looked at it.

791
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:35,273
The Autobiography of Killy
Gagley: The Bronx Wolf.

792
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:37,943
Volume one, 10th revised edition.

793
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:38,944
The end.

794
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,865
(Killy sighs)

795
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,576
Ah, hell.

796
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:49,414
There's no way it'll get
past one volume anyway.

797
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:56,086
- Nothing more can be said.

798
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:57,546
The glitter of this blade,

799
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,256
polished to perfection,

800
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,842
is a beauty which never fades.

801
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:06,012
People are no different.

802
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:09,350
(welding rod whooshing)

803
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:17,691
- You know, I was pretty
damn good with my hands

804
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,234
when I was a little kid.

805
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:21,236
Used to build plastic model kits

806
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,654
I'd steal from stores.

807
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:24,239
- My family was so elite

808
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,283
that I didn't have that many friends.

809
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:28,952
I built lots of super alloy model kits.

810
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:32,748
Purchased, of course, with my
American Express gold card.

811
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:35,334
(both sighing)

812
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:40,089
I miss those days, just being a kid.

813
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:45,427
- I really miss our common interest.

814
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:46,428
- Gloomy.

815
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:49,682
Damn gloomy.

816
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:55,353
(tools clattering)
- [Both] Don't squawk!

817
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:57,856
(crow squawks quietly)

818
01:02:57,857 --> 01:03:00,443
(bell tolling)

819
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:20,755
(bright music)

820
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:25,676
(Remy chuckles)

821
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:39,941
(singing in foreign language)

822
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:39,000
- Hey there!

823
01:04:39,001 --> 01:04:40,293
You guys need a lift?

824
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,968
- We're giving our project a test run.

825
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:51,929
Free rides to the enemy cathedral.

826
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:00,145
(bell chimes)

827
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:01,731
- Okay, all aboard!

828
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:07,320
(metal sparking)

829
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:14,410
Full speed ahead.

830
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,300
- My body's so cold.

831
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:31,927
So, so cold.

832
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:35,764
- [Mysterious Voice] Yes,
your sleep has come this far.

833
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,808
- It's not right, just dying like this.

834
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:40,518
It's not right.

835
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:41,853
- [Mysterious Voice]
There's nothing you can do.

836
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:43,229
Just give up.

837
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:46,274
This is all you could've
expected from your life.

838
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,817
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

839
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:50,195
- [Mysterious Voice]
Adieu, farewell, Remy.

840
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:52,323
- Adieu, whoever you are.

841
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,911
- [Mysterious Voice 2] Don't
give her that adieu stuff.

842
01:05:57,912 --> 01:05:59,704
- [Mysterious Voice 3] Yeah, he's right.

843
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:00,705
- Who's there?

844
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:03,834
- [Mysterious Voice 3] Who?

845
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:05,418
Well, you haven't met us yet

846
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:07,629
but there's a chance you will.

847
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,214
You're one of us!

848
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:10,215
- One of you?

849
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:11,800
I don't have any friends.

850
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:12,635
- [Mysterious Voice 4] Not friends.

851
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:14,010
We're all alone like you.

852
01:06:14,011 --> 01:06:15,262
So you're one of us.

853
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:18,890
- You're all alone too?

854
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:20,600
- [Mysterious Voice 5]
I've never had anything

855
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:22,268
since I was born.

856
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:24,396
No parents, no brothers or sisters,

857
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:26,523
or even a house with lights in it.

858
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:29,275
- [Mysterious Voice 3] My
parents died when I was little.

859
01:06:29,276 --> 01:06:31,194
Right now I'm in military school

860
01:06:31,195 --> 01:06:33,321
studying how to be a spy,

861
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,865
so I don't have any friends.

862
01:06:35,866 --> 01:06:37,867
We all live in different places,

863
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:39,120
all of us alone.

864
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,706
- [Mysterious Voice 4] But we
think we might meet someday.

865
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:43,748
- [Mysterious Voice 5]
Of course, we don't know

866
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:45,751
for sure if we will.

867
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:49,672
- Will I really meet you?

868
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:53,675
- [Mysterious Voice 2] Who
can say? But we're here now.

869
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:56,970
- Will you play with me, whoever you are?

870
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,651
- [Mysterious Voice 4] That's why we came.

871
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:01,474
(Remy laughs)

872
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:03,184
- [Cuttnal] What do you
mean you called a hearse?

873
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,687
- I'm sorry, but it's almost time for it.

874
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:08,106
- [Kernagul] Can't you
do anything else for her?

875
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:10,775
- This hospital is here
to serve the living

876
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:14,320
and over 200,000 people
a day get sick or injured

877
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:15,947
in this city alone.

878
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:18,283
We can't waste a bed on a terminal case

879
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:19,701
for even one hour.

880
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,162
The dead have no business being here.

881
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,081
It's as simple as that.

882
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:28,501
And I have final say over
making a life or death call

883
01:07:28,502 --> 01:07:31,004
and that's just the law of the city.

884
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:33,257
Isn't that right, Surgeon General?

885
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:36,801
- It's hopeless.

886
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:38,846
- The Grim Reaper's knocking on the door.

887
01:07:40,347 --> 01:07:42,307
- I give her 30 minutes.

888
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:45,477
- But there's still a small chance.

889
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:46,312
- [Doctor] Yes.

890
01:07:46,313 --> 01:07:49,105
There's no point in
isolating her any longer.

891
01:07:49,106 --> 01:07:50,566
You can go in if you want.

892
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:59,366
(monitor beeping)
(machine whooshing)

893
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:09,043
(bell chiming)

894
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:13,005
(ominous music)

895
01:08:37,154 --> 01:08:38,196
- Here they come.

896
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:40,990
- Well, these guys just
love to race, don't they?

897
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:43,159
(upbeat music)

898
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,412
(grunting)

899
01:08:46,747 --> 01:08:49,791
(explosion booms)

900
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:52,962
(gun banging rapidly)

901
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:57,424
(explosion booms)

902
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:04,765
(explosion booms)

903
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:09,561
(guns banging rapidly)

904
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:12,481
(glass shattering)

905
01:09:13,774 --> 01:09:14,774
- Why, you!

906
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:28,955
Hang on. We're going in!

907
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:31,374
- Strike team, up top. Keep it moving.

908
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:32,375
- You got it.

909
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:51,937
- Here we go!

910
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:06,493
(all grunting)

911
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:18,255
(explosion booms)

912
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,093
- That worked perfect.

913
01:10:24,094 --> 01:10:25,054
- Okay, handsome.

914
01:10:25,055 --> 01:10:27,514
Go fly up there and give them a hand.

915
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:34,479
- Huh?

916
01:11:13,018 --> 01:11:15,854
(explosion booms)

917
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:21,151
(clocks ticking)

918
01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:29,575
- So, you've made it this far.

919
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:32,829
Whatever you do won't change anything.

920
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:36,874
You cannot escape from
this city or your destiny.

921
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:37,710
- Really?

922
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:40,420
Well, then if we can't
leave we'll just destroy it

923
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:42,214
and then we will survive.

924
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:44,507
Do you read me, Cuttnal? Come in.

925
01:11:44,508 --> 01:11:47,761
(guns banging rapidly)

926
01:11:50,597 --> 01:11:51,432
- Yeah?

927
01:11:51,433 --> 01:11:53,683
Bundle, how's it going on your end?

928
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:56,269
- [Bundle] It's time. Let them have it.

929
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:58,731
- All right, lets hit 'em, Kernagul.

930
01:12:09,366 --> 01:12:11,534
Time for the real show, big boy.

931
01:12:11,535 --> 01:12:13,036
- While the kids were showing off

932
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:14,787
for Remy for the past two days,

933
01:12:14,788 --> 01:12:17,790
we were doing our own thing around town.

934
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:20,836
(explosions booming)

935
01:12:36,643 --> 01:12:39,730
- Destroying the city changes nothing.

936
01:12:40,814 --> 01:12:45,109
It exists only to form
the fear of destiny.

937
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:47,153
- Well I'm changing mine.

938
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:49,697
(gun bangs)

939
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:51,991
(creature growls)

940
01:12:51,992 --> 01:12:54,243
- [Elder] Nothing can be altered.

941
01:12:54,244 --> 01:12:55,704
It will be as it was.

942
01:12:58,415 --> 01:13:00,333
- No one's coming.

943
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:01,834
No one's here.

944
01:13:01,835 --> 01:13:03,294
So quiet.

945
01:13:03,295 --> 01:13:05,797
Yeah, I'm going to die.

946
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:09,509
My body's so cold, so cold.

947
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:10,843
I'll just give up.

948
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:14,639
I guess this is all I
could've expected from life.

949
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,974
- Is that me?

950
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:17,935
No!

951
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:18,769
It's wrong.

952
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:19,936
Something's different.
(clocks chiming)

953
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:21,187
- What's different?

954
01:13:21,188 --> 01:13:23,064
Nothing can save me.

955
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:24,816
I'm going to die.

956
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:25,651
- No, no.

957
01:13:25,652 --> 01:13:27,068
That's not me!

958
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:30,113
(gun bangs)

959
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:31,864
- But why am I...

960
01:13:31,865 --> 01:13:32,991
Why am I not you?

961
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:41,834
(creature growls)
(tense music)

962
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:57,349
(earth crumbling)

963
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:09,235
- You who dares rebel
against your own destiny.

964
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:12,489
- I hate you all! I wish you were dead!

965
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:20,998
(creature growls)

966
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:33,385
(Remy grunts)
(officer grunting)

967
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:43,103
- You can't change fate, streetwalker.

968
01:14:51,778 --> 01:14:54,114
(gun bangs)

969
01:15:06,084 --> 01:15:09,170
- Damn. I can't shoot anymore.

970
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:10,756
- Remy, get ahold of yourself.

971
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,842
We're here with you.

972
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:16,123
- [Kernagul And Cuttnal] Us too!

973
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:26,939
- Remy, I never said what day
my letter of fate gave me.

974
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:30,274
I'll tell you now.

975
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:31,443
It was yesterday.

976
01:15:32,402 --> 01:15:35,071
But here I am still alive, Remy.

977
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:36,531
See?

978
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:38,242
You can beat it too.

979
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:40,368
- Bundle.

980
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:42,663
- [Bundle] Do you understand?

981
01:15:49,836 --> 01:15:51,128
- Don't give up, Remy.

982
01:15:51,129 --> 01:15:52,171
Later.

983
01:15:52,172 --> 01:15:53,172
- Be seein' ya.

984
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:56,467
- I don't know what to say.

985
01:15:56,468 --> 01:15:59,971
- Remy's catchphrase, \"See
ya again\" seems appropriate.

986
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:02,139
- Why, you overblown piece of...

987
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:07,145
(both laughing)
(crow squawking)

988
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:11,858
- Where are you going?

989
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:17,322
(soft music)

990
01:16:28,208 --> 01:16:29,542
Thanks, guys.

991
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:30,835
We'll meet again.

992
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:33,671
We haven't really met
yet but maybe someday.

993
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:35,048
Yeah, someday.

994
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:47,060
- [Man] Anybody down there?

995
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:48,937
- It's me!

996
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:49,938
It's me, Remy!

997
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:52,274
- [Man] Down in there?

998
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:54,525
I don't believe it.

999
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:56,444
She's still alive.

1000
01:16:56,445 --> 01:17:01,450
(monitor beeping)
(machine whooshing)

1001
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:03,743
- Remy, think back.

1002
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:05,077
Think back to when we fought together.

1003
01:17:05,078 --> 01:17:06,329
You never gave up then.

1004
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:07,747
Don't you give up now.

1005
01:17:07,748 --> 01:17:08,748
- Hang on, Remy.

1006
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:12,419
(Cuttnal groans)

1007
01:17:24,848 --> 01:17:29,811
(guns banging rapidly)
(explosions booming)

1008
01:17:41,948 --> 01:17:45,409
(wind rustling)

1009
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:46,827
- Well, I'd better go.

1010
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:49,665
(creature growls)

1011
01:17:54,961 --> 01:17:59,883
(gun bangs)
(Remy screams)

1012
01:18:07,474 --> 01:18:09,226
I won't be beaten.

1013
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:15,190
(uplifting music)

1014
01:18:16,316 --> 01:18:18,484
- Why does she fight it even now?

1015
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:20,861
- This is beyond me.

1016
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:22,614
- Because she won't give up.

1017
01:18:24,491 --> 01:18:25,826
No matter what.

1018
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:35,126
(gun bangs)
(Remy yelps)

1019
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:37,670
(singing in foreign language)

1020
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:40,257
(Remy yelping)

1021
01:19:12,205 --> 01:19:14,624
(gun clicks)

1022
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:18,086
(Remy screams)

1023
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:36,646
No more ammo.

1024
01:19:38,356 --> 01:19:39,356
That's it.

1025
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:46,114
(guns banging rapidly)

1026
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:54,288
One shot.

1027
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:04,090
(Remy panting)

1028
01:20:55,892 --> 01:20:57,268
I have one shot.

1029
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:58,436
Make it count!

1030
01:20:59,312 --> 01:21:01,648
(gun bangs)

1031
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:11,031
(creature roars)

1032
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:13,451
(Remy moans)

1033
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,269
(ominous music)

1034
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:57,829
(monitor beeping)

1035
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:12,427
- [Doctor] I'm truly sorry.

1036
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,239
- Where are you going?

1037
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:49,880
Fess up, Bundle.

1038
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:51,048
- What do you mean?

1039
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:52,800
- You lied, didn't you?

1040
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:53,801
- [Bundle] Hmm?

1041
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:56,720
- About your letter
saying it was yesterday.

1042
01:22:56,721 --> 01:22:59,264
You just said that so I wouldn't give up.

1043
01:22:59,265 --> 01:23:00,100
- Perhaps.

1044
01:23:00,101 --> 01:23:02,685
But you're still alive, in any case.

1045
01:23:02,686 --> 01:23:04,896
And even after they made a grave for you.

1046
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:10,401
Here lies Remy Shimada.

1047
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:11,402
- No kidding.

1048
01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:13,571
Bastards.

1049
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:17,825
Bang.

1050
01:23:29,462 --> 01:23:32,298
(monitor beeping)

1051
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:43,684
(nurse screams)

1052
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:46,438
(glass shatters)

1053
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:49,523
You forgot.

1054
01:23:49,524 --> 01:23:51,108
- What?

1055
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:53,277
- I didn't lose hope that time.

1056
01:23:53,278 --> 01:23:55,571
As long as you stay alive,

1057
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:57,364
even if you haven't met them yet,

1058
01:23:57,365 --> 01:23:59,742
even if you're not sure you ever will,

1059
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:03,328
you may find people who
will be very special.

1060
01:24:03,329 --> 01:24:04,329
- Really?

1061
01:24:08,501 --> 01:24:09,501
- Yeah.

1062
01:24:10,503 --> 01:24:13,256
(birds chirping)

1063
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:28,604
- I can't believe it's over.

1064
01:24:28,605 --> 01:24:31,566
- Yeah, everything is over for us now.

1065
01:24:34,652 --> 01:24:35,944
- Guys!

1066
01:24:35,945 --> 01:24:36,945
Guys, wait up!

1067
01:24:38,823 --> 01:24:41,242
(soft music)

1068
01:24:56,883 --> 01:24:58,635
I wanna stay with everyone.

1069
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:01,845
- Beautiful.

1070
01:25:01,846 --> 01:25:04,557
Always knew you were.

1071
01:25:06,893 --> 01:25:09,395
(Remy laughs)

1072
01:25:41,177 --> 01:25:44,013
(uplifting music)
